      <field name="fulltext">SONGS OF TWO WORLDS. FIRST SERIES (1872). SOUL-MUSIC. My soul is as a bird Singing in fair weather, Deep in shady woodlands through the Evening's dewy calm; Every glossy feather On her full throat stirred, As she pours out, rapt, unconscious, all the sweetness of her psalm; Mounting high, and higher, higher, Soaring now, now falling, dying; Now through silvery pauses sighing; Throbbing now with joyous strife, And rushing tides of love and life, Till some ray of heavenly fire Shot obliquely through the shade, Pierces her; and lo! the strain Of the music she has made Fills her with a sudden pain. Then she forgets to sing Her former songs of gladness; Sitting mute in silence sweeter than the Old forgotten lays; Till anon some note of sadness, Long-drawn, languishing, Faint at first, swells onward slowly to a subtler depth of praise, As the low, wild, minor, broken By the ghosts of gayer fancies, Like a rippling stream advances, Till the full tide grown too deep, Whispers first, then falls asleep. Then, as souls with no word spoken Grow together, she, mute and still, Thrills through with a secret voice, Which the farthest heaven can fill, And constrains her to rejoice. And the passer-by who hears, Not the burst of pleasure, Swelling upward, sweet, spontaneous, to the portals of the sky, But a chastened measure, Low and full of tears; And anon the voiceless silence, when the last notes sink and die, Deems some influence malign, Checks the current of her song; For that none are happy long. Nay; but to the rapt soul come Sounds that strike the singer dumb, And the silence is Divine; For when heaven gives back the strain, All its joyous tones are o'er; First the low sweet notes of pain, Then, the singer sings no more. LOVE'S MIRROR. I see myself reflected in thine eyes, The dainty mirrors set in golden frame Of eyelash, quiver with a sweet surprise, And most ingenuous shame. Like Eve, who hid her from the dread command Deep in the dewy blooms of paradise; So thy shy soul, love calling, fears to stand Discovered at thine eyes. Or, like a tender little fawn, which lies Asleep amid the fern, and waking, hears Some careless footstep drawing near, and flies, Yet knows not what she fears: So shrinks thy soul; but, dearest, shrink not so; Look thou into mine eyes as I in thine: So our reflected souls shall meet and grow, And each with each combine In something nobler; as when one has laid Opposite mirrors on a cottage wall; And lo! the never-ending colonnade, The vast palatial hall. So our twin souls, by one sweet suicide, Shall fade into an essence more sublime; Living through death, and dying glorified, Beyond the touch of time. ON A YOUNG POET. Here lay him down in peace to take his rest, Who tired of singing ere the day was done. A little time, a little, beneath the sun, He tarried and gave forth his artless song; The bird that sings with the dawn, sings not for long, Only when dew is on the grass his breast Thrills, but his voice is silent long ere noon. So sang he once, but might not long sustain The high pure note of youth, for soon, too soon! He ceased to know the sweet creative pain Made still one voice, amid the clamorous strife, And proved no more the joys or pains of life. And better so than that his voice should fail, And sink to earth, and lose its heavenlier tone; Perchance, if he had stayed, the sad world's moan, The long low discord of incessant wrong, Had marred the perfect cadence of his song, And made a grosser music to prevail. But now it falls as pure upon the ear, As sings the brown bird to the star of eve, Or child's voice in grey minster quiring clear. Rather then, give we thanks for him than grieve. Thoughts of pure joys which but in memory live, More joy than lower present joys can give. For him, deep rest or high spontaneous strains; For us, fierce strife and low laborious song; For him, truth's face shining out clear and strong; For us, half lights, thick clouds, and darkling days. No longer walks his soul in mortal ways, Nor thinks our thoughts, nor feels our joys or pains, Nor doubts our doubts, nor any more pursues, Knowing all things, the far-off searchless cause; Nor thrills with art, or nature's fairest hues, Gazing on absolute beauty's inmost laws; Or lies for ever sunk in dreamless sleep, Nor recks of us;‚Äîand therefore 'tis we weep. But surely if he sleep, some fair faint dream, Some still small whisper from his ancient home, Not joy, nor pain, but mixt of each shall come; Or if he wake, the thought of earthly days Shall add a tender sweetness to his praise; Tempering the unbroken joyance of his theme. And by-and-by the time shall come when we, Laden with all our lives, once more shall meet, Like friends, who after infinite wastes of sea, Look in each other's eyes; and lo! the sweet Sad fount of memory to its depths is stirred, And the past lives again, without a word. Mourn not for him! perchance he lends his voice To swell the fulness of the eternal psalm; Or haply, wrapt in nature's holy calm, As lurks the seed within the vital earth, He quickens surely to a higher birth. Mourn not for him! but let your souls rejoice. We know not what we shall be, but are sure The spark once kindled by the Eternal breath, Goes not out quite, but somewhere doth endure In that strange life we blindly christen death. Somewhere he is, though where we can not tell; But wheresoe'er God hides him, it is well. TO THE SETTING SUN. Stay, O sweet day, nor fleet so fast away For now it is that life revives again, As the red tyrant sinks beneath the hill; And now soft dews refresh the arid plain; And now the fair bird's voice begins to thrill; With hidden dolours making sweet her strain And wakes the woods that all day were so still. Stay, O sweet day, nor fleet so fast away; For now the rose and all fair flowers that blow Give out sweet odours to the perfumed air, And the white palace marbles blush and glow, And the low, ivy-hidden cot shows fair. Why are time's feet so swift, and ours so slow? Haste, laggard! night will fall ere you are there. Stay, O sweet day, nor fleet so fast away; Soon the pale full-faced moon will slowly climb Up the steep sky and quench the star of love. Moonlight is fair, but fairer far the time When through the leaves the dying shafts above Slope, and the minster sounds its curfew chime, And the long shadows lengthen through the grove. Stay, O sweet day, nor fleet so fast away; For, hark! the chime throbs from the darkling tower; Soon for the last time shall my love be here: Fair day, renew thy rays for one brief hour. O sweet day, tarry for us, tarry near; To-morrow, love and time will lose their power, And sighs be mine, and the unbidden tear. Stay, O sweet day, nor fleet so fast away. But, ah! thou may'st not; in the far-off west Impatient lovers weary till you rise; Or may be caring naught thou traversest The plains betwixt thee and thy final skies: Go, then; though darkness come, we shall be blest, Keeping sweet daylight, in each other's eyes. THE TREASURE OF HOPE. O fair bird, singing in the woods, To the rising and the setting sun, Does ever any throb of pain Thrill through thee ere thy song be done: Because the summer fleets so fast; Because the autumn fades so soon; Because the deadly winter treads So closely on the steps of June? O sweet maid, opening like a rose In love's mysterious, honeyed air, Dost think sometimes the day will come When thou shalt be no longer fair: When love will leave thee and pass on To younger and to brighter eyes; And thou shalt live unloved, alone, A dull life, only dowered with sighs? O brave youth, panting for the fight, To conquer wrong and win thee fame, Dost see thyself grown old and spent, And thine a still unhonoured name: When all thy hopes have come to naught, And all thy fair schemes droop and pine And wrong still lifts her hydra heads To fall to younger arms than thine? Nay; song and love and lofty aims May never be where faith is not; Strong souls within the present live; The future veiled,‚Äîthe past forgot: Grasping what is, with thews of steel, They bend what shall be, to their will; And blind alike to doubt and dread, The End, for which they are, fulfil. THE LEGEND OF FAITH. They say the Lord of time and all the worlds, Came to us once, a feeble, new-born child; All-wise, yet dumb; weak, though omnipotent: Surely a heaven-sent vision, for it tells How innocence is godlike. And the Lord Renews, through childhood, to our world-dimmed eyes, The half forgotten splendours of the skies. And because motherhood is sacreder And purer far than any fatherhood, White flowers are fairer than red fruit, and sense Brings some retributive pain; the virgin queen Sits 'mid the stars, and cloistered courts are filled With vain regrets, dead lives, and secret sighs, And the long pain of weary litanies. And because we, who stand upon the shore, See the cold wave sweep up and take with it White spotless souls, and others lightly soiled, Yet with no stain God deems indelible: These are His saints mighty to intercede, Those in some dim far country tarry, and there Are purified; and both are reached by prayer. And as the faith once given changes not, But we are weak as water; yet is life A process, and where growth is not is death. God gave His priests infallible power to tell The true faith as it is, and how it grew: And lo! the monstrous cycle shows complete, And the Church brings the nations to her feet. BY THE SEA. A little country churchyard, On the verge of a cliff by the sea; Ah! the thoughts of the long years past and gone That the vision brings back to me For two ways led from the village,‚Äî One, by the rippled sands, With their pink shells fresh from the ebbing wave For childish little hands. And one by the breezy cliff-side, All splendid with purple and gold, With its terrible humble-bees trumpeting deep, And butterflies fair to behold. And the boom of the waves on the shingle, And hymn of the lark to the sun; Made Sabbath sounds of their own, ere the chime Of the church-going bell had begun. I remember the churchyard studded With peasants who loitered and read The sad little legends, half effaced, On the moss-grown tombs of the dead. And the gay graves of little children, Fashioned like tiny cots; With their rosemary and southernwood, And blue-eyed forget-me-nots. Till the bell by degrees grew impatient, Then ceased as the parsonage door Opened wide for the surpliced vicar, And we loitered and talked no more. I remember the cool, dim chancel, The drowsy hum of the prayers: And the rude psalms vollied from seafaring throats As if to take heaven unawares. Till, when sermon-time came, by permission We stole out among the graves, And saw the great ocean a-blaze in the sun, And heard the deep roar of the waves. And clung very close together, As we spelt out with pitying tears, How a boy lay beneath who was drowned long ago, And was ‚ÄúAged eleven years.‚Äù And heard, with a new-born wonder, The voice of the insinite Sea, Whose hither-shore is the shore of Death, And whose further, the Life to be. ‚ÄúDid the sea swallow up little children? Could God see the wickedness done? Nor spare one swift-winged seraph to save From the thousands around His throne?‚Äù ‚ÄúWas he still scarce older than we were, Still only a boy of eleven? Where child-angels children always In the sorrowless courts of heaven?‚Äù Ah me! of those childish dreamers, One has solved the last riddle since then: And knows the dread secret which none may know Who walk in the ways of men. The other has seen the splendour And mystery fading away; Too wise or too dull to take thought or care For aught but the needs of the day. VOICES. Oh! sometimes when the solemn organ rolls Its stream of sound down gray historic aisles; Or the full, high-pitched struggling symphony Pursues the fleeting melody in vain: Like a fawn through shadowy groves, or heroine Voiced like a lark, pours out in burning song Her love or grief; or when, to the rising stars Linked village maidens chant the hymn of eve; Or Sabbath concourse, flushed and dewy-eyed Booms its full bass; or before tasks begun, Fresh childish voices sanctify the morn: My eyes grow full, my heart forgets to beat. What is this mystic yearning fills my being? Hark! the low music wakes, and soft and slow Wanders at will through flowery fields of sound; Climbs gentle hills, and sinks in sunny vales, And stoops to cull sweet way-side blooms, and weaves A dainty garland; then, grown tired, casts down With careless hand the fragrant coronal, And child-like sings itself to sleep. Anon The loud strain rises like a strong knight armed, Battling with wrong; or passionate seer of God Scathing with tongue of fire the hollow shows, The vain deceits of men; or law-giver, Parting in thunder from the burning hill With face aflame; or with fierce rush of wings And blazing brand, upon the crest of Sin, The swift archangel swooping; or the roll Which follows on the lightning;‚Äîall are there In that great hurry of sound. And then the voice Grows thinner like a lark's, and soars and soars, And mounts in circles, higher, higher, higher, Up to heaven's gate, and lo! the unearthly song Thrills some fine inner chord, and the swift soul, Eager and fluttering like a prisoned bird, Breaks from its cage, and soars aloft to join The enfranchised sound, and for a moment seems To touch on some dim border-land of being, Full of high thought and glorious enterprise And vague creative fancies, till at length Waxed grosser than the thin ethereal air, It sinks to earth again. And then a strain Sober as is the tender voice of home, Unbroken like a gracious life, and lo Young children sit around me, and the love I never knew is mine, and so my eyes Grow full, and all my being is thrilled with tears. What is this strange new life, this finer sense, This passionate exaltation, which doth force Like the weird Indian juggler, instantly My soul from seed to flower, from flower to fruit, Which lifts me out of self, and bids me tread Without a word, on dim a√´rial peaks, Impossible else, and rise to glorious thoughts, High hopes, and inarticulate fantasies Denied to soberer hours? No spoken thought Of bard or seer can mount so far, or lift The soul to such transcendent heights, or work So strong a spell of love, or roll along Such passionate troubled depths. No painter's hand Can limn so clear, the luminous air serene Of Paradise, the halcyon deep, the calm Of the eternal snows, the eddy and whirl Of mortal fight, the furious flood let loose From interlacing hills, the storm which glooms Over the shoreless sea. Our speech too oft Is bound and fettered by such narrow laws, That words which to one nation pierce the heart, To another are but senseless sounds, or weak And powerless to stir the soul; but this Speaks with a common tongue, uses a speech Which all may understand, or if it bear Some seeds of difference in it, only such As separates gracious sisters, like in form, But one by gayer fancies touched, and one Rapt by sweet graver thoughts alone, and both Mighty to reach the changing moods of the soul, Or grave or gay, and though sometimes they be Mated with unintelligible words, Or feeble and unworthy, yet can lend A charm to gild the worthless utterance, And wing the sordid chrysalis to float Amid the shining stars. Oh strange sweet power, Ineffable, oh gracious influence, I know not whence thou art, but this I know. Thou holdest in thy hand the silver key That can unlock the sacred fount of tears, Which falling make life green; the hidden spring Of purer fancies and high sympathies: No mirth is thine, thou art too high for mirth,‚Äî Like Him who wept but smiled not mirth is born On the low plains of thoughts best reached by words. But those who scale the untrodden mountain peak, Or sway upon the trembling spire, are far From laughter; so thy gracious power divine, Not sad but solemn, stirs the well of tears, But not mirth's shallow spring: tears are divine, But mirth is of the earth, a creature born Of careless youth and joyance; satisfied With that which is; parched by no nobler thirst For that which might be; pained by no regret For that which was, but is not: but for thee. Oh, fair mysterious power, the whole great scheme Lies open like a book; and if the charm Of its high beauty makes thee sometimes gay, Yet 'tis an awful joy, so mixed with thought, That even Mirth grows grave, and evermore The myriad possibilities unfulfilled, The problem of Creation, the immense Impenetrable depths of thought, the vague Perplexities of being, touch thy lips And keep thee solemn always. Oh, fair voice, Oh virginal, sweet interpreter, reveal Our inner selves to us, lay bare the springs, The hidden depths of life, the high desires Which lurk there unsuspected, the remorse Which never woke before; unclothe the soul Of this its shroud of sense, and let it mount, On the harmonious beat of thy light wings, Up to those heights where life is so attuned, So pure and self-concordant; filled so deep With such pervading beauty that no voice Mars the unheard ineffable harmony, And o'er white plain and breathless summit reigns A silence sweeter than the sweetest sound. WEAKNESS MADE STRONG. If I were poor and weak, Bankrupt of hope, and desolate of love; Without a tongue to speak The strange dumb thoughts of thee which through me move; Then would I freely venture, sweet, To cast my soul down at thy feet. Or were I proud and great; Were all men envious, and all women kind, And yet my high estate Showed poor beside the riches of my mind: Then would I boldly stoop, to rise Up to the height of thy dear eyes. But being not weak nor strong, Cast in the common mould of coarser clay; Sure 'twere to do thee wrong To set my humble homage in thy way, And cloud thy sunny morn, which I would fain Keep clear and fair, with my poor private pain. Only since love and I are so ingrown, That for my weakness is my love so strong; And scarce I know what love's is, what mine own, Nor whether love or I inspire my song: Take thou my weakness to thy strength, and give Strength to my weakness, sweet, and bid me live. WAKING. Open, my soul, thy stately portals wide; Open full wide, and let thy King come in! How shall he come? In royal pomp and pride, Ushered by braying trumpets' clamorous din; Clothed round with purple; crowned with burning gold: A kingly presence, glorious to behold? Nay; for he is no mortal king, to come With trumpet peals and crowds and garish state; But silent to the soul he makes his home, He enters by some lowly postern gate! And she, within her chambers far withdrawn, Cries like the wakeful bird that greets the dawn. It may be she is seated 'mid the throng, Crowned with the flowers of life and youth and health; Thrilled through by breathing art or passionate song, Or faint with hot pursuit of fame or wealth; Rapt by the glorious thoughts of saints or seers, Or radiant with the bless√®d dew of tears. And then the wicket swings without a sound, And lo! a ghostly presence, pale and gray,‚Äî Sad eyes which dwell not on the things around, But gaze for ever on the Far-off Day! Then a low voice, whispering, ‚ÄúThy King is come; Rejoice, be glad, for here he makes his home.‚Äù Then rises she and hastens to the gate,‚Äî Her royal gate, and there she casts her down: Prone at his feet bewails her low estate, Yet prays him he will enter to his own! Spurns from her all her robes of pride, and stands, Knowing her shame, to do her Lord's commands, Whom with a touch he fashions for her part; Dowers with the precious gifts of bard or sage; The hand to fix the dreams of deathless art, The imperial will, the patriot's noble rage: Or fills with such fine affluence of love, That she grows holy as the saints above. Then open, O my soul! thy portals wide, Open, and let thy Lord and Ruler come; Open, if haply he may here abide, And make within thee his eternal home. Open thy gates, thy halls, thine inmost shrine, Till all are flooded with the Light divine. AT HAVRE DE GRACE. Above the busy Norman town, The high precipitous sea-cliffs rise, And from their summit looking down The twin-lights shine with lustrous eyes; Far out upon the fields of foam, The first to greet the wanderer home. Man here has known at last to tame Nature's wild forces to his will; Those are the lightning's fires which flame, From yon high towers with ray so still: And knowledge, piercing through the night Of time, has summoned forth the light. And there, hard by the lighthouse door, The earthly set by the divine; At a stone's cast, or scarcely more, Rises a little pagan shrine, Where the rough seamen come to pray, And wives, for dear ones far away. There, on a starry orb, there stands A heavenly goddess, proud and fair; No infant holds she in her hands Which must a queenly sceptre bear. Nay; wonder not, for this is she Who rules the fury of the sea. Star of the sea, they call her, yet Liker to Her√© doth she show, Than Aphrodit√©, rising wet From the white waves, with limbs aglow. Calmer she seems, more pure and sweet, To the poor kneelers at her feet. Before her still the vestal fires Burn unextinguished day and night; And the sweet frankincense expires And fair flowers blow, and gems are bright: For a great power in heaven is she, This star and goddess of the sea. Around the temple, everywhere, Rude tablets hung, attest her might; Here the fierce surge she smooths, and there Darts downward on a bar of light; To quench the blazing ship, or save The shipwrecked from the hungry wave. And sea-gifts round the shrine are laid, Poor offerings, costlier far than gold: Such as the earlier heathen made, To the twin Deities of old,‚Äî Toy ships, shells, coral, glittering spar, Brought here by grateful hands from far. A very present help indeed, This goddess is to whom they bow; We seek Thy face with hearts that bleed, And straining eyes, dread Lord! but Thou Hidest Thyself so far away, Our thoughts scarce reach Thee as we pray. But is this she, whom the still voice Of angels greeted in the night; Bidding the poor maid's heart rejoice, With visions hid from wiser sight: This heathen nymph, this tinselled queen, First of all mothers who have been? Gross hearts and purblind eyes, to make An idol of a soul so sweet! Could you no meaner essence take, No brazen image with clay feet; No saint from out the crowd of lies, False signs and shameful prodigies? For this one bears too great a name, Above all other women blest; The bless√®d mother,‚Äîall her fame Is His who nestled to her breast: They do but dull her glory down, These childless arms, this earthly crown. Poor peasant mother! scarce a word Thou spak'st, the long-drawn years retain; Only thy womb once bare the Lord; Only thou knew'st the joy, the pain, The high hope seeming quenched in blood That marked thy awful motherhood. No trace of all thy life remains, From His first childhood to the cross; A life of little joys and pains, Of humble gain and trivial loss: Contented if the ewes should bear Twin lambs, or wheat were full in ear. Or if sometimes the memory Of that dread message of the night Troubled thy soul, there came to thee New precious duties; till the flight, The desert sands, the kneeling kings, Showed but as half-forgotten things. Or sometimes, may be, pondering deep On miracles of word and deed, Vague doubts across thy soul would creep, Still faithful to the older creed: Could this thy son indeed be He, This child who prattled at thy knee? And of thy after-life, thy age, Thy death, no record; not a line On all the fair historic page To mark the life these hold divine: Only some vague tradition, faint As the sick story of a saint. But thou no longer art to-day The sweet maid-mother, fair and pure; Vast time-worn reverend temples gray, Throne thee in majesty obscure; And long aisles stretch in minsters high, 'Twixt thee, fair peasant, and the sky. They seek to honour thee, who art Beyond all else a mother indeed; With hateful vows that blight the heart, With childless lives, and souls that bleed: As if their dull hymns' barren strain Could fill a mother with aught but pain! To the gross earth they bind thee down With coils of fable, chain on chain; From plague or war to save the town; To give, or hold; the sun, or rain; To whirl through air a favourite shrine,‚Äî These are thy functions, and divine. And see, in long procession rise The fair Madonnas of all time; They gaze from sweet maternal eyes, The dreams of every Christian clime: Brown girls and icy queens, the breast And childish lips proclaim them blest. Till as the gradual legend grew, Born without stain, and scorning death; Heavenward thou soarest through the blue, While saints and seers aspire beneath: And fancy-nurtured cam'st to be Queen over sky and earth and sea. Oh, sin! oh, shame! oh, folly! Rise; Poor heathen, think to what you bow; Consider, beyond God's equal skies, What pains that faithful soul must know,‚Äî She a poor peasant on the throne Raised for the Lord of Life, alone. O sweet! O heart of hearts! O pure Above all purest maids of earth! O simple child, who didst endure The burden of that awful birth: Heart, that the keenest sword didst know, Soul bowed by alien loads of woe! Sweet soul! have pity; intercede, Oh mother of mothers, pure and meek; They know no evil,‚Äîrise and plead For these poor wandering souls and weak; Tear off those pagan rags, and lead Their worship where 'tis due indeed. For wheresoever there is home, And mothers yearn with sacred love, There, since from Heaven itself they come, Are symbols of the life above: Again the sweet maid-mother mild, Again the fair Eternal child. WHEN I AM DEAD. When I am dead and turned to dust, Let men say what they will, I care not aught; Let them say I was careless, indolent, Wasted the precious hours in dreaming thought, Did not the good I might have done, but spent My soul upon myself,‚Äîsometimes let rise Thick mists of earth betwixt me and the skies: What must be must. But not that I betrayed a trust; Broke some girl's heart, and left her to her shame; Sneered young souls out of faith; rose by deceit; Lifted by credulous mobs to wealth and fame; Waxed fat while good men waned, by lie and cheat; Cringed to the strong; oppressed the poor and weak: When men say this, may some find voice to speak, Though I am dust. LOVE'S SUICIDE. Alas for me for that my love is dead! Buried deep down, and may not rise again; Self-murdered, vanished, gone beyond recall, And this is all my pain. 'Tis not that she I loved is gone from me, She lives and grows more lovely day by day; Not Death could kill my love, but though she lives, My love has died away. Nor was it that a form or face more fair Forswore my troth, for so my love had proved Eye-deep alone, not rooted in the soul; And 'twas not thus I loved. Nor that by too long dalliance with delight And recompense of love, my love had grown Surfeit with sweets, like some tired bee that flags 'Mid roses over-blown. None of these slew my love, but some cold wind, Some chill of doubt, some shadowy dissidence, Born out of too great concord, did o'er cloud Love's subtle inner sense. So one sweet changeless chord, too long sustained, Falls at its close into a lower tone: So the swift train, sped on the long, straight way, Sways, and is overthrown. For difference is the soul of life and love, And not the barren oneness weak souls prize: Rest springs from strife, and dissonant chords beget Divinest harmonies. THE RIVER OF LIFE. Bright with unnumbered laughters, and swollen by a thousand tears, Rushes along, through upland and lowland, the river of life; Sometimes foaming and broken, and sometimes silent and slumbrous, Sometimes down rocky glens, and sometimes through flowery plains. Sometimes the mountains draw near, and the black depths swirl at their bases, Sometimes the limitless meads fade on the verge of the sky, Sometimes the forests stand round, and the great trees cast mystical shadows, Sometimes the golden wheat waves, and girls fill their pitchers and sing. Always the same strange flow, through changes and chances unchanging, Always‚Äîin youth and in age, in calm and in tempest the same‚Äî Whether it sparkle transparent and give back the blue like a mirror, Or sweep on turbid with flood, or black with the garbage of towns‚Äî Whether the silvery scale of the minnow flash on the pebbles, Or whether the poisonous ooze cling like a shroud round the dead‚Äî Whether it struggle through shoals of white blooms and feathery grasses, Or bear on its bosom the hulls of oceantost navies‚Äîthe same. Flow on, O mystical river, flow on through desert and city; Broken or smooth, flow onward into the Infinite sea. Who knows what urges thee on, what dark laws and cosmical forces Stain thee or keep thee pure, and bring thee at last to thy goal? What is the cause of thy rest or unrest, of thy foulness or pureness? What is the secret of life, or the painful riddle of death? Why is it better to be than to cease, to flow on than to stagnate? Why is the river-stream sweet, while the sea is as bitter as gall? Surely we know not at all, but the cycle of Being is eternal, Life is eternal as death, tears are eternal as joy. As the stream flowed, it will flow; though 'tis sweet, yet the sea will be bitter: Foul it with filth, yet the deltas grow green and the ocean is clear. Always the sun and the winds will strike its broad surface and gather Some purer drops from its depths, to float in the clouds of the sky;‚Äî Soon these shall fall once again, and replenish the full-flowing river. Roll round then, O mystical cycle! flow onward, ineffable stream! A HEATHEN HYMN. O Lord, the Giver of my days, My heart is ready, my heart is ready; I dare not hold my peace, nor pause, For I am fain to sing Thy praise. I praise Thee not, with impious pride, For that Thy partial hand has given Bounties of wealth or form or brain, Good gifts to other men denied. Nor weary Thee with blind request, For fancied goods Thy hand withholds; I know not what to fear or hope, Nor aught but that Thy will is best. Not whence I come, nor whither I go, Nor wherefore I am here, I know; Nor if my life's tale ends on earth, Or mounts to bliss, or sinks to woe. Nor know I aught of Thee, O Lord; Behind the veil Thy face is hidden: We faint, and yet Thy face is hidden; We cry,‚ÄîThou answerest not a word. But this I know, O Lord, Thou art, And by Thee I too live and am; We stand together, face to face, Thou the great whole, and I the part. We stand together, soul to soul, Alone amidst Thy waste of worlds; Unchanged, though all creation fade, And Thy swift suns forget to roll. Wherefore, because my life is Thine, Because, without Thee I were not; Because, as doth the sea, the sun, My nature gives back the Divine. Because my being with ceaseless flow Sets to Thee as the brook to the sea; Turns to Thee, as the flower to the sun, And seeks what it may never know. Because, without me Thou hadst been For ever, seated midst Thy suns; Marking the soulless cycles turn, Yet wert Thyself unknown, unseen. I praise Thee, everlasting Lord, In life and death, in heaven and hell: What care I, since indeed Thou art, And I the creature of Thy word. Only if such a thing may be: When all Thy infinite will is done, Take back the soul Thy breath has given, And let me lose myself in Thee. IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE. Under the picture gallery wall, As a sea-leaf clings to a wave-worn rock, Nor shrinks from the surging impetuous shock Of the breakers which gather and whiten and fall‚Äî A child's form crouches, nor seems to heed The ceaseless eddy and whirl of men: Men and women with hearts that bleed, Men and women of wealth and fame, High in honour, or sunk in shame, Pass on like phantoms, and pass again. And he lies there like a weed. A child's form, said I; but looking again It is only the form that is childish now, For age has furrowed the low dull brow, And marked the pale face with its lines of pain. Yet but few years have fled, since I first passed by, For a dwarf's life is short if you go by the sun, And marked in worn features and lustreless eye Some trace of youth's radiance, though faint and thin, But now, oh, strange jest! there's a beard to his chin. And he lies there, grown old ere his youth is done, With his poor limbs bent awry. What a passer-by sees, is a monstrous head, With a look in the eyes as of those who gaze On some far-off sight with a dumb amaze; A face as pale as the sheeted dead, A frail body propt on a padded crutch, And lean long fingers, which flutter the keys Of an old accordion, returning their touch With some poor faint echoes of popular song, Trivial at all times and obsolete long, Psalm-tunes, and African melodies, Not differing very much. And there he sits nightly in heat and cold, When the fountains fall soft on the stillness of June, Or when the sharp East sings its own shrill tune, Patiently playing and growing old. The long year waxes and wanes, the great Flash by in splendour from rout or ball, Statesmen grown weary of long debate, Hurry by homewards, and fling him alms; Pitiful women, touched by the psalms, Bringing back innocence, stoop by the wall Where he lies at Dives' gate. What are his thoughts of, stranded there? While life ebbs and flows by, again and again, Does the old sad Problem vex his poor brain? ‚ÄúWhy is the world so pleasant and fair, Why, am I only who did no wrong Crippled and bent out of human form? Why are other men tall and strong? Surely if all men were made to rejoice, Seeing that we come without will or choice, It were better to crawl for a day like a worm, Than to lie like this so long! ‚ÄúThe blind shuffles by with a tap of his staff, The tired tramp plods to the workhouse ward,‚Äî But he carries his broad back as straight as a lord And the blind man can hear his little ones laugh, While I lie here like a weed on the sand, With these crooked limbs, paining me night and day. Would to Heaven, I were come to the promised land! Of the sweet old faith which was preached for the poor,‚Äî Where none shall be weary or pained any more, Nor change shall enter nor any decay, And the stricken down shall stand?‚Äù And perhaps sometimes when the sky is clear, And the stars show like lamps on the sweet summer night, Some chance chord struck with a sudden delight, Soars aloft with his soul, and brings Paradise near. And then‚Äîfor even nature is some-times kind‚Äî He lies stretched under palms with a harp of gold; Or is whirled on by coursers as fleet as the wind; And is no more crippled, nor weak nor bent; No more painful nor impotent; No more hungry, nor weary nor cold,‚Äî But of perfect form and mind. Or maybe his thoughts are of humbler cast, For hunger and cold are real indeed; And he longs for the hour when his toil shall be past, And he with sufficient for next day's need: Some humble indulgence of food or fire, Some music-hall ditty, or marvellous book, Or whatever it be such poor souls desire; And with this little solace, for God would fain Make even His measures of joy and pain, He drones happily on in his quiet nook, With hands that never tire. Well, these random guesses must go for naught Seeing it were surer and easier far To weigh to an atom the faintest star, Than to sound the dim depths of a brother's thought. But whenever I hear those poor snatches of song, And see him lie maimed in body and soul, While I am straight and healthy and strong, I seem to redden with a secret shame, That we can thus differ who should be the same, While I hear the World's thundering chariot-wheels roll Unpitying along WATCH. Oh, hark! the languid air is still, The fields and woods seem hushed and dumb. But listen, and you shall hear a thrill, An inner voice of silence come, Stray notes of birds, the hum of bees, The brook's light gossip on its way, Voices of children heard at play, Leaves whispering of a coming breeze. Oh, look! the sea is fallen asleep, The sail hangs idle evermore; Yet refluent from the outer deep, The low wave sobs upon the shore. Silent the dark cave ebbs and fills, Silent the broad weeds wave and sway; Yet yonder fairy fringe of spray Is born of surges vast as hills. Oh, see! the sky is deadly dark, There shines not moon nor any star; But gaze awhile, and you shall mark Some gleam of glory from afar: Some half-hid planet's vagrant ray; Some lightning flash which wakes the world; Night's pirate banner slowly furled; And, eastward, some faint flush of day. DROWNED. Only eighteen winters old! Lay her with a tender hand On the delicate, ribbed sea-sand: Stiff and cold; ay, stiff and cold. What she has been, who shall care? Looking on her as she lies With those stony, sightless eyes, And the sea-weed in her hair. Think, O mothers! how the deep All the dreary night did rave; Thundering foam and crested wave, While your darlings lay asleep. How she cleft the midnight air; And the idiot surge beneath Whirled her sea-ward to her death, Angry that she was so fair. Tossed her, beat her, till no more Rage could do, through all the night; Then with morning's ghastly light, Flung her down upon the shore. Mother! when brief years ago You were happy in your child, Smiling on her as she smiled, Thought you she would perish so? Man! who made her what she is; What, if when you falsely swore You would love her more and more, You had seen her lie like this. And, O Infinite Cause! didst Thou, When Thou mad'st this hapless child, Dowered with passions, fierce and wild, See her lie as she lies now? Filled with wild revolt and rage, All I feel I may not speak; Fate so strong, and we so weak, Like rats in a cage,‚Äîlike rats in a cage. THE WANDERER. I reared my growing Soul on dainty food, I fed her with rich fruit and garnered gold Sown freely by the pious provident hands Of the wise dead of old. The long procession of the fabulous Past, Rolled by for her‚Äîthe earliest dawn of time; The seven great Days; the garden and the sword; The first red stain of crime; The fierce rude chiefs who smote, and burned, and slew, And all for God; the pitiless tyrants grand, Who piled to heaven the eternal monuments, Unchanged amid the sand; The fairy commonwealths, where Freedom first Inspired the ready hand and glowing tongue To a diviner art and sweeter song Than men have feigned or sung; The strong bold sway that held mankind in thrall, Soldier and jurist marching side by side, Till came the sure slow blight, when all the world Grew sick, and swooned, and died; Again the long dark night, when Learning dozed Safe in her cloister, and the world without Rang with fierce shouts of war and cries of pain, Base triumph, baser rout; Till rose a second dawn of light again, Again the freemen stood in firm array Behind the foss, and Pope and Kaiser came, Wondered and turned away; And then the broadening stream, till the sleek priest Aspired to tread the path the Pagan trod, And Rome fell once again, and the brave North Rose from the Church to God. All these passed by for me, till the vast tide Grew to a sea too wide for any shore; Then doubt o'erspread me, and a cold disgust, And I would look no more. For something said, ‚ÄúThe Past is dead and gone, Let the dead bury their dead, why strive with Fate? Why seek to feed the children on the husks Their rude forefathers ate?‚Äù ‚ÄúFor even were the Past reflected back As in a mirror, in the historic page, For us its face is strange, seeing that the Race Betters from age to age.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd if, hearing the tale we told our-selves, We marvel how the monstrous fable grew; How in these far-off years shall men discern The fictive from the true?‚Äù Then turned I to the broad domain of Art, To seek if haply Truth lay hidden there; Well knowing that of old close links connect The true things and the fair. Fair forms I found, and rounded limbs divine, The maiden's grace, the tender curves of Youth, The majesty of happy perfect years, But only half the truth. For there is more, I thought, in man, and higher, Than animal graces cunningly combined; Since oft within the unlovely frame is set The shining, flawless mind. So I grew weary of the pallid throng, Deep bosomed maids and stalwart heroes tall. One type I saw, one earthy animal seal Of comeliness in all! But not the awful, mystical human soul‚Äî The soul that grovels and aspires in turn‚Äî The soul that struggles outward to the light Through lips and eyes that burn. So, from the soulless marbles, white and bare And cold, too-perfect art, I turned and sought The canvases, where Christian hands have fixed The dreams of saintly thought. Passion I found, and love, and godlike pain, The swift soul rapt by mingled hopes and fears, Eyes lit with glorious light from the Unseen, Or dim with sacred tears. But everywhere around the living tree I marked the tangled growths of fable twine, And gross material images confuse The earthly and divine. I saw the Almighty Ruler of the worlds, The one unfailing Source of Light and Love, A frowning gray-beard throned on rolling clouds, Armed with the bolts of Jove. The Eternal Son, a shapeless new-born child, Supine upon His peasant-mother's knees, Or else a ghastly victim, crushed and worn By corporal agonies. The virgin mother‚Äînow a simple girl; Or old and blurred with tears, and wan with sighs; And now a Pagan goddess, giving back Unspiritual eyes. Till faring on what spark of beaven was there, Grew pale, then went out quite; and in its stead, Dull copies of dull common life usurped The empire of the dead. Or if sometimes, rapt in a sweet suspense, I knew a passionate yearning thrill my soul, As down long aisles from lofty quires I heard The solemn music roll; Or if at last the long-drawn symphony, After much weary wandering seemed to soar To a finer air, and subtle measures born On some diviner shore, I thought how much of poor mechanical skill, How little fire of heart, or force of brain, Was theirs who first devised or now declared That magical sweet strain; And how the art was partial, not immense, As Truth is, or as Beauty, but confined To this our later Europe, not spread out, Wide as the width of mind. So then from Art, and all its empty shows And outward-seeming truth, I turned and sought The secret springs of knowledge which lie hid Deep in the wells of thought. The hoary thinkers of the Past I knew; Whose dim vast thoughts, to too great stature grown, Flashed round as fitful lightning flashes round The black vault of the Unknown. Who, seeing that things are Many, and yet are One; That all things suffer change, and yet remain‚Äî That opposite flows from opposite, Life and Death, Love, Hatred, Pleasure, Pain‚Äî Raised high upon the mystical throne of life Some dim abstraction, hopeful to unwind The tangled maze of things, by one rude guess Of an untutored mind. The sweet Ideal Essences revealed, To that high poet-thinker's eyes saw; The archetypes which underset the world With one broad perfect Law. The fair fantastic Commonwealth, too fair For earth, wherein the wise alone bore rule‚Äî So wise that oftentimes the sage himself Shows duller than the fool; And that white soul, clothed with a satyr's form, Which shone beneath the laurels day by day, And, fired with burning faith in God and Right, Doubted men's doubts away; And him who took all knowledge for his own, And with the same swift logical sword laid bare The depths of heart and mind, the mysteries Of earth and sea and air; And those on whom the visionary East Worked in such sort, that knowledge grew to seem An ecstasy, a sudden blaze, revealed To crown the mystic's dream; Till, once again, the old light faded out, And left no trace of that fair day remain‚Äî Only a barren method, binding down Men's thoughts with such a chain That knowledge sank self-slain, like some stout knight Clogged by his harness; nor could wit devise Aught but ignoble quibbles, subtly mixed With dull theologies. Not long I paused with these; but passed to him Who, stripping, like a skilful wrestler, cast From his strong arms the precious deadly web, The vesture of the past; And looked in Nature's eyes, and, foot to foot, Strove with her daily, till the witch at length Gave up, reluctant, to the questing mind The secret of her strength. And then the old fight, fought on modern fields,‚Äî Whether we know by sense or inward sight‚Äî Whether a law within, or use alone, Mark out the bounds of right‚Äî All these were mine; and then the ancient doubt, Which scarce kept silence as this master taught The undying soul, or that one subtly probed The process of our thought, And shuddered at the dreadful innocent talk To the cicala's chirp beneath the trees‚Äî Love poised on silver wings, love fallen and fouled By black iniquities; And laughed to scorn their quest of cosmic law, Saw folly in the Mystic and the Schools, And in the Newer Method gleams of truth Obscured by childish rules; Rose to a giant's strength, and always cried‚Äî You shall not find the truth here, she is gone; What glimpse men had, was ages since, and these Go idly babbling on‚Äî Jangles of opposite creeds, alike untrue, Quaint puzzles, meaningless logomachies, Efforts to scan the infinite core of things With purblind finite eyes. Go, get you gone to Nature, she is kind To reasonable worship; she alone Thinks scorn, when humble seekers ask for bread, To offer them a stone. And Nature drew me to her, and awhile Enchained me. Day by day, things strange and new Rose on me; day by day, I seemed to tread Fresh footsteps of the true. I laid life's house bare to its inmost room With lens and scalpel, marked the simple cell Which might one day be man or creeping worm, For aught that sense could tell,‚Äî Thrust life to its utmost home, a speck of gray No more nor higher, traced the wondrous plan, The wise appliances which seem to shape The dwelling-place of man,‚Äî Nor halted here, but thirsted still to know, And, with half-blinded eyesight, loved to pore On that scarce visible world, born of decay Or stranded on the shore. Marked how the Mother works with earth and gas, And with what subtle alchemy knows to blend The vast conflicting forces of the world To one harmonious end; And, nightly gazing on the splendid stars, Essayed in vain with reverent eye to trace The chain of miracles by which men learnt The mysteries of space; And toiled awhile with spade and hammer, to learn The dim long sequences of life, and those Unnumbered cycles of forgotten years Ere life's faint light arose; And loved to trace the strange sweet life of flowers, And all the scarce suspected links which span The gulf betwixt the fungus and the tree, And 'twixt the tree and man. Then suddenly, ‚ÄúWhat is it that I know? I know the shows and changes, not the cause; I know but long successions, which usurp The name and rank of Laws. ‚ÄúAnd what if the design I think I see Be but a pitiless order, through the long Slow wear of chance and suffering working out Salvation for the strong? ‚ÄúHow else, if scheme there be, can I explain The cripple or the blind, the ravening jaw, The infinite waste of life, the plague, the sword, The evil, thriftless law, ‚ÄúOr seeming errors of design, or strange Complexities of structure, which suggest A will which sported with its power, or worked Not careful for the best?‚Äù I could not know the scheme, nor therefore spend My soul in painful efforts to conform With those who lavished life and brain to trace The story of a worm; Nor yet with those who, prizing over-much The unmeaning jargon of their science, sought To hide, by arrogance, from God and man Their poverty of thought, And, blind with fact and stupefied by law, Lost sight of the Creator, and became Dull bigots, narrowed to a hopeless creed, And priests in all but name. Thus, tired with seeking truth, and not content To dwell with those weak souls who love to feign Unending problems of the life and love Which they can ne'er explain; Nor those who, parrot-like, are proud to clothe In twenty tongues the nothing that they know; Nor those whom barren lines and numbers blind To all things else below; And half-suspecting, when the poet sang And drew my soul to his, and round me cast Fine cords of fancy, but a sleight of words, Part stolen from the past‚Äî I thought, My life lies not with books, but men! Surely the nobler part is his who guides The State's great ship through hidden rocks and sands, Rude winds and popular tides,‚Äî A freeman amongst freemen,‚Äîand contrives, By years of thought and labour, to withdraw Some portion of their load from lives bent down By old abusive law! A noble task; but how to walk with those Who by fate's subtle irony ever hold The freeman's ear‚Äîthe cunning fluent knave, The dullard big with gold? And how, when worthier souls bore rule, to hold Faction more dear than Truth, or stoop to cheat, With cozening words and shallow flatteries The Solons of the street? Or, failing this, to wear a hireling sword‚Äî Ready, whate'er the cause, to kill and slay, And float meanwhile, a gilded butterfly, My brief inglorious day‚Äî Or, in the name of Justice, to confuse, For hire, with shameless tongue and subtle brain, Dark riddles, which, to honest minds unwarped, Were easy to explain‚Äî Or, with keen salutary knife, to carve For hire the shrinking limb; or else to feign Wise words and healing powers, though knowing naught In face of death and pain‚Äî Or grub all day for pelf 'mid hides and oils, Like a mole in some dark alley, to rise at last, After dull years, to wealth and ease, when all The use for them is past‚Äî Or else to range myself with those who seek By reckless throws with chance, by trick and cheat, Swift riches lacking all the zest of toil, And only bitter-sweet. Or worst, and still for hire, to feign to hear A voice which called not, calling me to tell Now of an indolent heaven, and now, obscene Threats of a bodily hell. Then left I all, and ate the husks of sense; Oh, passionate coral lips! oh, shameful fair! Bright eyes, and careless smiles, and reckless mirth! Oh, golden rippling hair! Oh, rose-strewn feasts, made glad with wine and song And laughter-lit! oh, whirling dances sweet, When the mad music faints awhile and leaves Low beats of rhythmic feet! Oh, glorious terrible moments, when the sheen Of silk, and straining limbs flash thundering by, And name and fame and honour itself, await Worse hazard than the die! All these were mine. Then, thought I, I have found The truth at last; here comes not doubt to pain; Here things are what they seem, not figments, born Of a too busy brain. But soon, the broken law avenged itself; For, oh, the pity of it! to feel the fire Grow colder daily, and the soaring soul Sunk deep in grosser mire. And oh, the pity of it! to drag down lives Which had been happy else, to ruin, and waste The precious affluence of love, which else Some humble home had graced. And oh! the weariness of feasts and wine; The jests where mirth was not, the nerves unstrung, The throbbing brain, the tasteless joys, which keep Their savour for the young. These came upon me, and a vague unrest, And then a gnawing pain; and then I fled, As one some great destruction passes, flees A city of the dead. Then, pierced by some vague sense of guilt and pain, ‚ÄúGod help me!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere is no help in life, Only continual passions waging war, Cold doubt and endless strife!‚Äù But He is full of peace, and truth, and rest, I give myself to Him; I yearn to find What words divine have fallen from age to age Fresh from the Eternal mind. And so, upon the reverend page I dwelt, Which shows Him formless, self-contained, all-wise, Passionless, pure, the soul of visible things, Unseen by mortal eyes; Who oft across dim gulfs of time revealed, Grew manifest, then passed and left a foul Thick mist of secular error to obscure The upward gazing soul; And that which told of Opposite Principles, Of Light with Darkness warring evermore; Ah me! 'twas nothing new, I had felt the fight Within my soul before. And those wise Answers of the far-off sage, So wise, they shut out God, and can enchain To-day in narrow bonds of foolishness The subtle Eastern brain. And last, the hallowed pages dear to all, Which bring God down to earth, a King to fight With His people's hosts; or speaking awful words From out the blaze of light,‚Äî Which tell how earthly chiefs who loved the right, Were dear to Him; and how the poet-king Sang, from his full repentant heart, the strains Sad hearts still love to sing. And how the seer was filled with words of fire, And passionate scorn and lofty hate of Ill, So pure, that we who hear them seem to hear God speaking to us still, But mixed with these, dark tales of fraud and blood, Like weeds in some fair garden; till I said, ‚ÄúThese are not His; how shall a man discern The living from the dead? ‚ÄúI will go to that fair Life, the flower of lives; I will prove the infinite pity and love which shine From each recorded word of Him who once Was human, yet Divine. ‚ÄúOh, pure sweet life, crowned by a godlike death; Oh, tender healing hand; oh, words that give Rest to the weary, solace to the sad, And bid the hopeless live! ‚ÄúOh, pity, spurning not the penitent thief; Oh, wisdom, stooping to the little child; Oh, infinite purity, taking thought for lives By sinful stains defiled! ‚ÄúWith thee will I dwell, with thee.‚Äù But as I mused, Those pale ascetic words renewed my doubt: The cheek, which to the smiter should be turned, The offending eye plucked out. The sweet impossible counsels which may seem Too perfect for our need; nor recognise A duty to the world, not all reserved For that beyond the skies. ‚ÄúAnd was it truth, or some too reverent dream Which scorned God's precious processes of birth, And spurned aside for Him, the changeless laws Which rule all things of earth? ‚ÄúOr how shall some strange breach of natural law Be proof of moral truth; yet how deny That He who holds the cords of life and death Can raise up those who die? ‚ÄúYet how to doubt that God may be revealed; Is He more strange, incarnate, shedding tears, Than when the unaided scheme fulfils itself Through countless painful years? ‚ÄúBut if revealed He be, how to escape The critic who dissects the sacred page, Till God's gift hangs on grammar, and the saint Is weaker than the sage!‚Äù These warring thoughts held me, and more; but when The simple life divine shone forth no more, And the fair truth came veiled in stately robes Of philosophic lore; And 'twas the apostle spoke, and not the Christ; The scholar, not the Master; and the Church Defined itself, and sank to earthly thrones: ‚ÄúSurely,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúmy search ‚ÄúIs vain;‚Äù and when with magical rite and spell They killed the Lord, and sought with narrow creed, Half-fancy, half of barbarous logic born, To heal the hearts that bleed; And heretic strove with heretic, and the Church Slew for the truth itself had made: again, ‚ÄúCan these things be of Him?‚Äù I thought, and felt The old undying pain. And yet the fierce false prophet turned to God The gross idolatrous East; and far away, Beyond the horrible wastes, the lewd knave makes A Paradise to-day. Yet deep within my being still I kept Two sacred fires alight through all the strife,‚Äî Faith in a living God; faith in a soul Dowered with an endless life. And therefore though the world's foundations shook, I was not all unhappy; knowing well That He whose hand sustained me would not bear To leave my soul in hell. But now I looked on nature with strange eyes, For something whispered, ‚ÄúSurely all things pass; All life decays on earth or air or sea,‚Äî All wither like the grass.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese are, then have been, we ourselves decline, And cease and turn to earth, and are as they: Shall our dear animals rise; shall the dead flowers Bloom in another May? ‚ÄúThe seed springs like the herb, but not the same; And like us, not the same, our children rise; The type survives, though suffering gradual change, The individual dies. ‚ÄúHow shall one seek to sever, e'en in thought, Body and soul; how show to doubting eyes That this returns to dust, while the other soars Deathless beyond the skies? ‚ÄúAnd if it be a lovely dream‚Äîno more, And life is ended with our latest breath, May not the same sweet fancy have devised The Lord of life and death? ‚ÄúWe know Him not at all, nor may conceive Beginning or yet ending. Is it more To image an Eternal World, than one Where nothing was before? ‚ÄúWhence came the Maker? Was He uncreate? Then why must all things else created be? Was He created? Then, the Lord I serve, Lies farther off than He. ‚ÄúOr if He be indeed, yet the soul dies. Why, what is He to us? not here, not here! His judgments fall, wrong triumphs here‚Äîright sinks; What hope have we, or fear?‚Äù I could not answer, yet when others came, Affirming He was not, and bade me live In the present only, seizing unconcerned What pleasures life could give, My doubt grown fiercer, scoffed at them, ‚ÄúOh fools, And blind, your joys I know; the universe Confutes you; can you see right yield to might, The better to the worse,‚Äî ‚ÄúNor burn to adjust them? If it were a dream, Would all men dream it? Can your thought conceive The end you tell of better than the life, Which all men else believe? ‚ÄúOr if we shrink as from a hateful voice, From mute analogies of frame and shape, Surely no other than a breath Divine Gave reason to the ape.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat made all men to call on God? what taught The soaring soul its lofty heavenward flight? What led us to discern the strait bounds set, To sever wrong from right? ‚ÄúBe sure, no easier is it to declare He is not than He is:‚Äù and I who sought Firm ground, saw here the same too credulous faith And impotence of thought. And when they brought me their fantastic creed, With a figment for a god‚Äîmock ceremonies‚Äî Man worshipping himself‚Äîmock priests to kill The soul's high liberties,‚Äî I spurned the folly with a curse, and turned To dwell with my own soul apart, and there Found no companion but the old doubt grown To an immense despair. Then, as a man who, on a sunny day, Feeling some trivial ache, unknown before, Goes careless from his happy home, and seeks A wise physician's door. And when he comes forth, neither heeds nor sees The joyous tide of life or smiling sky, But always, always hears a ceaseless voice Repeating ‚ÄúThou shalt die.‚Äù So all the world flowed by, and all my days Passed like an empty vision, and I said, ‚ÄúThere is no help in life; seeming to live, We are but as the dead.‚Äù And thus, I tossed about long time; at last Nature rebelled beneath the constant pain, And the dull sleepless care forgot itself, In frenzy of the brain. And sometimes all was darkness, unrelieved, And sometimes I would wander day and night, Through fiery long arcades, which seared my brain With flakes of blinding light. And then I lay unmoved in a gray calm; Not life nor death, and the past came to seem Thought, act, faith, doubt, things of but little worth A dream within a dream. But, when I saw my country like a cloud, Sink in the East, and the free ocean-wind Fanned life's returning flame and roused again Slow pulse and languid mind; Soon the great rush and mystery of the sea, The grisly depths, the great waves surging on, Dark with white spuming crests which threaten death, Swoop by, and so are gone. And the strong sense of weakness, as we sped‚Äî Tossed high, plunged low, through many a furious night, And slept in faith, that some poor seaman woke To guide our course aright. All lightened something of my load, and seemed To solace me a little, for they taught, That the impalpable unknown might stretch, Even to the realms of thought. And so I wandered into many lands, And over many seas; I felt the chill Which in mid-ocean strikes on those who near The spire-crowned icy hill, And threaded fairy straits beneath the palms, Where, year by year, the tepid waters sleep; And where, round coral isles, the sudden sea Sinks its unfathomed deep. Upon the savage feverish swamp, I trod The desert sands, the fat low plains of the East; On glorious storied shores and those where man Was ever as the beast. And, day by day, I felt my frozen soul, Soothed by the healing influence of change, Grow softer, registering day by day, Things new, unknown, and strange. Not therefore, holding what it spurned before, Nor solving riddles, which before perplexed; But with new springs of sympathy, no more By impotent musings vexed. And last of all I knew the lovely land Which was most mighty, and is still most fair; Where world-wide rule and heavenward faith have left Their traces everywhere. And as from province to province I wandered on, City or country, all was fair and sweet; The air, the fields, the vines, the darkeyed girls, The dim arcaded street; The minsters lit for vespers, in the cool; Gay bridals, solemn burials, soaring chant, Spent in high naves, gray cross, and wayside shrine, And kneeling suppliant; And painting, strong to aid the eye of faith, And sculpture, figuring awful destinies: Thin campanili, crowning lake-lit hills, And sea-worn palaces. Then, as the sweet days passed me one by one, New tides of life through body and soul were sent; And daily sights of beauty worked a calm Ineffable content. And soon, as in the spring, ere frosts are done, Deep down in earth the black roots quicken and start, I seemed to feel a spring of faith and love Stir through my frozen heart. Till one still summer eve, when as I mused By a fair lake, from many a silvery bell, Thrilled from tall towers, I heard the Angelus, Deep peace upon me fell. And following distant organ-swells, I passed Within the circuit of a lofty wall, And thence within dim aisles, wherein I heard The low chant rise and fall. And dark forms knelt upon the ground, and all Was gloom, save where some dying day-beam shone, High in the roof, or where the votive lamp Burned ever dimly on. Then whether some chance sound or solemn word Across my soul a precious influence cast, Or whether the fair presence of a faith Born of so great a Past, Smote me; the wintry glooms were past and done, And once again the Spring-time, and once more Faith from its root bloomed heavenward‚Äîand I sank Weeping upon the floor! Long time within that peaceful home I dwelt With those grave brethren, spending silent days And watchful nights, in solemn reverent thought, Made glad by frequent praise. And the awakened longing for the Truth, With the great dread of what had been before, The ordered life, the nearer view of heaven, Worked on me more and more. So that, I lived their life of prayer and praise, Alike in summer heats and wintry snows, Pacing chill cloisters 'neath the waning stars, Long ere the slow sun rose. And speaking little, and bringing down my soul With frequent fast and vigil, saw at length Truth's face show daily clearer and more clear To failing bodily strength. For living in a mystical air, and parched With thirst for faith and truth; at last I brought The old too-active logic to enforce The current of my thought. And wishing to believe, I took for true The shameless subtleties which dare to tell How the Eternal charged one hand to hold The keys of heaven and hell. ‚ÄúFor if a faith be given, then must there be A Church to guard it, and a tongue to speak, And an unerring mind to rule alike The strong souls and the weak.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd, because God's high purpose stands not still, But He is ever with His own, the tide Of miracle and dogma ceases not, But flows down strong and wide, ‚ÄúTo the world's ending.‚Äù So my mind fell prone, Before the Church; and teachings new and strange; The wafer, which to spirit and sense sustains Some dim incredible change‚Äî The substance which tho' altered yet retains The self-same accidents; the Virgin Queen, Immaculate in birth, and without death, Soaring to worlds unseen‚Äî The legends, ofttimes foolish, ofttimes fair, Of saints who set all natural laws at naught; The miracles, the portents, not the charm, Of the old Pagan thought‚Äî These shook me not at all, who only longed To drain the healing draught of faith again, And dreaded, with a coward dread, the thought Of the old former pain. The more incredible the tale, the more The merit of belief; the more I sought To reason out the truth, I knew the more The impotence of thought. And thus the swift months passed in prayer and praise, Bringing the day when those tall gates should close, And shut me out from thought and life and all Our heritage of woes. Then, one day, when the end drew very near, Which should erase the past for ever, and I Waited impatient, longing for the hour When my old self should die; I knelt at noon, within the darkened aisle, Before a doll tawdry with rich brocade, And all ablaze with gems, the precious gifts Which pious hands had made: Nor aught of strange I saw, so changed was I, In that dull fetish; nay, heaven's gate unsealed, And the veiled angels bent before the throne, Where sat their Lord revealed. While like a flood the ecstasy of faith Surged high and higher, swift to fall at last Lower and lower, when the rapture failed And faded, and was past. Lo, a sweet sunbeam, straying through the gloom Smote me, as when the first low shaft of day Aslant the night-clouds shoots, and momently Chases the mists away. And that ideal heaven was closed, and all That reverend house turned to a darkened room, A den of magic, masking with close fumes The odours of the tomb. Then passed I forth. Again my soul was free; Again the summer sun and exquisite air Made all things smile; and life and joy and love Beamed on me everywhere. And o'er the awakened earth there went a stir, A movement, a renewal. Round the spring In the broad village place, the darkeyed girls Were fain to dance and sing For the glad time. The children played their play, Like us who play at life; light bursts of song Came from the fields, and to the village church A bridal gleamed along. Far on the endless plain, the swift steam drew A soft white riband. Down the lazy flow Of the broad stream, I marked, round sylvan bends, The seaward barges go. The brown vine-dresser, bent among his vines, Ceased sometimes from his toil to hold on high His laughing child, while his deep-bosomed wife Cheerful sat watching by. And all the world was glad, and full of life, And I grew glad with it, and quickly came To see my past life as it was, and feel A salutary shame. For what was my desire? To set aside The perfect scheme of things, to live apart A sterile life, divorced from light and love, Sole, with an empty heart. And wherefore to fatigue the Eternal ear With those incessant hymns of barren praise? Does not a sweeter sound go up to Him From well-spent toilsome days,‚Äî And natural life, refined by honest love, And sweet unselfish liturgies of home, Heaven's will, borne onward by obedient souls, Careless of what may come? What need has He for praise? Forest and field, The winds, the seas, the plains, the mountains, praise Their Maker, with a grander litany Than our poor voices raise. What need has He of them? And looking back To those gray walls which late had shown so fair, I felt as one who from a dungeon 'scapes To free unfettered air. And half distrustful of myself, and full Of terror of what might be, once more fled, With scarce a glance behind, as one who flees A city of the dead. All through that day and night I journeyed on To the northward. With the dawn a tender rose Blushed in mid-heaven, and looking up, I saw Far off, the eternal snows. Then all day higher, higher, from the plain, Beyond the tinkling folds, beyond the fair Dense, self-sown chestnuts, then the scented pines, And then an eager air, And then the ice-fields and the cloudless heavens; And ever as I climbed, I seemed to cast My former self behind, and all the rags Of that unlovely past: The doubts, the superstitions, the regrets, The awakening; as the soul which hears the loud Archangel summon, rising, casts behind Corruption and the shroud. For I was come into a higher land, And breathed a purer air than in the past; And He who brought me to the dust of death Had holpen me at last. What then? A dream of sojourn 'mid the hills, A stir of homeward travel, swift and brief, Because the very hurry of the change Brought somewhat of relief. A dream of a fair city, the chosen seat Of all the pleasures, impotent to stay The thirsty soul, whose water-springs were laid In dear lands far away. A dream of the old crowds, the smoke, the din Of our dear mother, dearer far than fair; The home of lofty souls and busy brains, Keener for that thick air. Then a long interval of patient toil, Building the gradual framework of my art, With eyes which cared no more to seek the whole, Fast fixed upon the part. And mind, which shunned the general, absorbed In the particular only, till it saw What boundless possibilities lie for men 'Twixt matter and high law! How that which may be rules, not that which must; And absolute truth revealed, would serve to blind The soul's bright eye, and sear with tongues of flame The sinews of the mind. How in the web of life, the thread of truth Is woven with error; yet a vesture fair Comes from the loom‚Äîa precious royal robe Fit for a god to wear. Till at the last, upon the crest of toil Sat Knowledge, and I gained a newer truth: Not the pale queen of old, but a soft maid, Filled with a tender ruth. And, ray by ray, the clear-faced unity Orbed itself forth, and lo! the noble throng Of patient souls, who sought the truth in act, And grew, through silence, strong. Till prizing union more than dissidence, And holding dear the race, I came to prove A spring of sympathy within, which swelled To a deep stream of love. And Knowledge gave me gold, and power, and fame, And honour; and Love, a clearer, surer view: Thus in calm depths I moored my weary soul Fast anchored to the True. And now the past lies far away, and I Can scarce recall those vanished days again; No more the old faith stirs me, and no more Comes the old barren pain. For now each day brings its appointed toil, And every hour its grateful sum of care; And life grows sweeter, and the gracious world Shows day by day more fair. For now I live a two-fold life; my own And yet another's; and another heart Which beats to mine, makes glad the lonely world Where once I lived apart. And little lives are mine to keep unstained, Strange mystic growths, which day by day expand, Like the flowers they are, and set me in a fair Perpetual wonderland. New senses, gradual language, dawning mind, And with each day that passes, traced more strong On those white tablets, awful characters That tell of right and wrong. And what hand wrote them? One brief life declined, Went from us, and is not. Ah! what and where Is that fair soul? Surely it somewhere blooms In purer, brighter air. What took it hence, and whither? Can I bear To think, that I shall turn to a herb, a tree, A little earth or lime, nor care for these, Whatever things may be? Or shall the love and pity I feel for these End here, nor find a higher type or task? I am as God to them, bestowing more Than they deserve or ask. And shall I find no Father? Shall my being Aspire in vain for ever, and always tend To an impossible goal, which none shall reach,‚Äî An aim without an end? Or, shall I heed them when they bid me take No care for aught but what my brain may prove? I, through whose inmost depths from birth to death, Strange heavenward currents move; Vague whispers, inspirations, memories, Sanctities, yearnings, secret questionings, And oft amid the fullest blaze of noon, The rush of hidden wings? Nay; my soul spurns it! Less it is to know Than to have faith: not theirs who cast away The mind God gave them, eager to adore Idols of baser clay. But theirs, who marking out the bounds of mind, And where thought rules, content to understand, Know that beyond its kingdom lies a dread Immeasurable land. A land which is, though fainter than a cloud, Full of sweet hopes and awful destinies: A dim land, rising when the eye is clear Across the trackless seas. O life! O death! O faithful wandering soul! O riddle of Being, hard to understand! These are Thy dreadful secrets, Lord; and we The creatures of Thy hand. O'er wells of consciousness, too deep for thought, Thou broodest always, awful Power Divine; Thine are we still, the creatures of Thy hand, Living and dying, Thine. THE WEARY RIVER. There is a ceaseless river, Which flows down evermore Into a wailing ocean, A sea without a shore Broken by laughing ripple, Foaming with angry swell, Sweet music as of heaven, Deep thunder as of hell. Gay fleets float down upon it, And sad wrecks, full of pain: But all alike it hurries To that unchanging main. Sometimes 'tis foul and troubled, And sometimes clear and pure; But still the river flows, and still The dull sea doth endure. And thus 'twill flow for ever, Till time shall cease to be: O weary, weary river, O bitter, barren sea. TRUTH IN FALSEHOOD. Your little hand in mine I rest: The slender fingers, white and long, Lie in my broad palm, rude and strong, Like birdlings in their nest. Yours, like yourself, so soft and white, So delicately free from soil; Mine sunbrowned, hard with moil and toil, And seamed with scars of fight. Dear love! sometimes your innocence Strikes me with sudden chills of fear; What if you saw before you, dear, The secret gulfs of sense?‚Äî The coarseness, the deceit, the sin, We know, who 'mid the sordid crowd Must press, nor midst the tumult loud Can hear the voice within? What if you saw me with the eyes Of others,‚Äînay, my own,‚Äîor heard The unworthy tale, the biting word, The sneer that worldlings prize? Or knew me as I am indeed, No hero free from blot or stain, But a poor soul who drags his chain With halting feet that bleed,‚Äî Who oft-time slips and falls, content, Though bruised and weary, faint and worn, He toils all night, if with the morn When life and strength are spent, He sees some far-off struggling ray, Dispel the palpable obscure, And on the eastern hills, the pure White footprints of the day? But you, oh love, can never know These darkling paths; for you the light Shines always changeless, always bright, The self-same tempered glow. And love with innocence combined The nunnery of your heart shall guard, And faith with eye unfailing ward The jewel of your mind. So be it: I would sooner be Steeped to the lips in lie and cheat, A very monster of deceit, Than bare myself to thee. Nay, rather would I dare to hear At that great Day from lips of flame, Blown to all souls my tale of shame, Than whispered in thine ear. Strange riddle, to those who never knew Of good with evil intertwined The two-fold self, the links that bind The false things to the true; But to the seeing eye more clear Than blaze of noonday. So be sure If such deceit might keep thee pure, I'd glory in it, dear. TWO VOYAGES. Two ships which meet upon the ocean waste, And stay a little while, and interchange Tidings from two strange lands, which lie beneath Each its own heaven and particular stars, And fain would tarry; but the impatient surge Calls, and a cold wind from the setting sun Divides them, and they sadly drift apart, And fade, and sink, and vanish, 'neath the verge‚Äî One to the parching plains and seething seas Smitten by the tyrannous Sun, where Mind alone Withers amid the bounteous outer-world, And prodigal Nature dwarfs and chains the man‚Äî One to cold rains, rude winds, and hungry waves Spilt on the frowning granite, niggard suns, And snows and mists which starve the vine and palm, But nourish to more glorious growth the man. One to the scentless flowers and songless birds, Swift storms and poison stings and ravening jaws: One to spring violets and nightingales, Sleek-coated kine and honest gray-eyed skies. One to lie helpless on the stagnant sea, Or sink in sleep beneath the hurricane: One to speed on, white-winged, through summer airs, Or sow the rocks with ruin‚Äîwho shall tell? So with two souls which meet on life's broad deep, And cling together but may not stay; for Time And Age and chills of Absence wear the links Which bind them, and they part for evermore‚Äî One to the tropic lands of fame and gold, And feverish thirst and weariness of soul; One to long struggles and a wintry life, Decked with one sweet white bloom of happy love. For each, one fate, to live and die apart, Save for some passing smile of kindred souls; Then drift away alone, on opposite tides, To one dark harbour and invisible goal. THE WISE RULE. ‚ÄúTime flies too fast, too fast our life decays.‚Äù Ah, faithless! in the present lies our being; And not in lingering love for vanished days! ‚ÄúCome, happy future, when my soul shall live.‚Äù Ah, fool! thy life is now, and not again; The future holds not joy nor pain to give! ‚ÄúLive for what is: future and past are naught.‚Äù Ah, blind! a flash, and what shall be, has been. Where, then, is that for which thou takest thought? Not in what has been, is, or is to be, The wise soul lives, but in a wider time, Which is not any, but contains the three! THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING. ‚ÄúCry, cry aloud in the land, cry aloud in the streets of the city; Cry and proclaim that no more shall the blood of the people be shed. Too long have the great ones waxed strong, without justice or any pity, Too long have they ground down the poor, and eaten the people as bread.‚Äù Thus said the voice from the dead. ‚ÄúTerrible voice, I said, immoderate, voice of unreason, Not of themselves do the lowly ones mourn, or the great ones rejoice; He who hath made them unequal, hath made all things in their season; If they are mighty and strong, they were made without freedom or choice.‚Äù ‚ÄúCry, cry aloud,‚Äù said the voice. ‚ÄúHow shall the sins of the few be reckoned against the many? Are there no tender hearts and kind 'midst the selfish and proud; Merciful souls and pure, full of love for their suffering brothers; Pitiful, touched with compassion and care for the desolate crowd?‚Äù ‚ÄúCry,‚Äù said the voice, ‚Äúcry aloud.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, but the world is ruled by merciless rules unbending; The feeble folk fade from the earth, and only the mighty remain; Not men alone, but all things send upwards a clamour unending; Always the whole creation travails in sorrow and pain.‚Äô ‚ÄúCry, 'said the voice, ‚Äúcry again.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre not our sins and our fathers' worked out in our children's sorrow? Does not excess of laughter sink at its close in a sigh? Mirth and enjoyment to-day turn to pain and repentance to-morrow; Thousands are born every hour, in the place of the thousands who die.‚Äù ‚ÄúCry,‚Äù said the stubborn voice, ‚Äúcry.‚Äù ‚ÄúLo! He hath made all things; good and evil, sorrow and pleasure; Not as your ways are His ways, yet are ye not all in His hand? Just is He, though ye know not the measure wherewith He will measure; Dark things shall one day be clear; to obey is to understand!‚Äù Thus that voice, solemn and grand. OTHER DAYS. O Thrush, your song is passing sweet, But never a song that you have sung Is half so sweet as thrushes sang When my dear love and I were young. O Roses, you are sweet and red, Yet not so red nor sweet as were The roses that my mistress loved To bind within her flowing hair. Time filches fragrance from the flower; Time steals the sweetness from the song; Love only scorns the tyrant's power, And with the growing years grows strong. THE TRUE MAN. Take thou no thought for aught save right and truth, Life holds for finer souls no equal prize; Honours and wealth are baubles to the wise, And pleasure flies on swifter wing than youth. If in thy heart thou bearest seeds of hell, Though all men smile, yet what shall be thy gain? Though all men frown, if truth and right remain, Take thou no thought for aught; for it is well. Take thou no thought for aught; nor deem it shame To lag behind while knaves and dullards rise; Thy soul asks higher guerdon, purer fame, Than to loom large and grand in vulgar eyes. Though thou shouldst live thy life in vile estate, Silent, yet knowing that deep within thy breast Unkindled sparks of genius lie repressed,‚Äî Greater is he who is, than seemeth, great. If thou shouldst spend long years of hope deferred, Chilled through with doubt, and sickening to despair; If as cares thicken, friends grow cold and rare, Nor favouring voice in all the throng be heard; If all men praise him whom thou know'st to be Of lower aims and duller brain than thine,‚Äî Take thou no thought, though all men else combine In thy despite: their praise is naught to thee. Bethink thee of the irony of fate, How great men die inglorious and alone; How Dives sits within upon his throne, While good men crouch with Lazarus at the gate. Our tree of life set on Time's hither shore Blooms like the secular aloe once an age: The great names scattered on the historic page Are few indeed, but the unknown are more. Waste is the rule of life: the gay flowers spring, The fat fruits drop, upon the untrodden plain; Sea-sands at ebb are silvered o'er with pain; The fierce rain beats and mars the feeble wing; Fair forms grow fairer still for deep disease; Hearts made to bless are spent apart, alone. What claim hast thou to joy, while others moan? God made us all, and art thou more than these? Take thou no care for aught save truth and right; Content, if such thy fate, to die obscure; Wealth palls and honours, Fame may not endure, And loftier souls soon weary of delight. Keep innocence; be all a true man ought; Let neither pleasure tempt, nor pains appal: Who hath this, he hath all things, having naught; Who hath it not, hath nothing, having all. PASSING. To spring, to bloom, to fade,‚Äî This is the sum of the laborious years; Life preludes death as laughter ends in tears: All things that God has made Suffer perpetual change, and may not long endure. We alter day by day; Each little moment, as life's current rolls, Stamps some faint impress on our yielding souls; We may not rest nor stay, Drifting on tides unseen to one dread goal and sure. Our being is compassed round With miracles; on this our life-long sleep, Strange whispers rise from the surrounding deep, Like that weird ocean sound Borne in still summer nights on weary watching ears. The selves we leave behind Affright us like the ghosts of friends long dead; The old love vanished in the present dread, They visit us to find New sorrows, alien hopes, strange pleasures, other fears. FETTERS. Oh who shall say that we are free! Surely life's chains are strong to bind From youth to age, from birth to death, Body and mind. We run the riotous race of youth, Then turn from evil things to good: 'Tis but a slower pulse, a chill Of youth's hot blood. We mount the difficult steeps of thought, Or pace the dusty paths of gain: 'Tis but that sense receding leaves A keener brain. Time takes this too, and then we turn Our dim eyes to the hidden shore; Life palls, and yet we long to live,‚Äî Ay, nothing more. RICH AND WISE. Wild flowers in spring were sweet to childish hands As riches to the wretch possessing naught; And as the water-springs in desert lands Are the pale victories of patient thought: But sweeter, dearest, sweeter far, The hours when we together are. No more I know the childish joys of old, Nor yet have learnt the grave delights of age: A miser, gloat I on thy locks' rich gold; A student, ponder on thy soul's fair page. Thus do I grow both rich and wise, On these fair locks and those deep eyes. Therefore in wit and wealth do I increase, Poring on thee, as on a fair writ book; No panic-fear can make that rich stream cease, Nor doubt confuse the crystal of thy look. Some to the mart, some to the oratory, May turn them: thou art both to me. LOVE IN DEATH. Dear heart! what a little time it is since Francis and I used to walk From church in the still June evenings together, busy with loving talk; And now he is gone, far away over seas, to some strange foreign country,‚Äîand I Shall never rise from my bed any more, till the day when I come to die. I tried not to think of him during the prayers; but when his dear voice I heard, I failed to take part in the hymn; for my heart fluttered up to my throat like a bird, And scarcely a word of the sermon I caught. I doubt 'twas a grievous sin; But 'twas only one poor little hour in the week that I had to be happy in. When the blessing was given, and we left the dim aisles for the light of the evening star; Though I durst not lift up my eyes from the ground, yet I knew that he was not far. And I hurried on, though I fain would have stayed, till I heard his footstep draw near; And love rising up in my breast like a flame, cast out every shadow of fear. Ah me! 'twas a pleasant pathway home,‚Äîa pleasant pathway and sweet; Ankle deep through the purple clover; breast high 'mid the blossoming wheat; I can hear the landrails prate through the dew, and the night-jars' tremulous thrill, And the nightingale pouring her passionate song from the hawthorn under the hill. One day, when we came to the wicket gate, 'neath the elms, where we used to part, His voice began to falter and break as he told me I had his heart. And I whispered back that mine was his: we knew what we felt long ago; Six weeks are as long as a lifetime almost, when you love each other so. So we put up the banns, and were man and wife, in the sweet fading time of the year, And till Christmas was over and past, I knew no shadow of sorrow or fear. It seems like a dream already, alas! a sweet dream vanished and gone, So hurried and brief while passing away, so long to look back upon. I had only had him three little months, and the world lay frozen and dead, When the summons came, which we feared and hoped, and he sailed over seas for our bread. Ah, well! it is fine to be wealthy and grand, and never to need to part; But 'tis better far to love and be poor than be rich with an empty heart. Though I thought 'twould have killed me to lose him at first, yet was he not going for me? So I hid deep down in my breast all the grief, which I knew it would pain him to see. He'd surely be back by the autumn, he said; and since his last passionate kiss He has scarcely been out of my thoughts, day or night, for a moment, from that day to this. When I wrote to him how I thought it would be, and he answered so full of love, Ah! there was not an angel happier than I, in all the white chorus above. And I seemed to be lonely no longer, the days and the weeks passed so swiftly away; And the March winds died, and the sweet April showers gave place to the blossoms of May. And then came the sad summer eve, when I sat with the little frock in the sun, And Patience ran in with the news of the ship‚ÄîAh, well! may His will be done. They said that all hands were lost, and I swooned away on the floor like a stone; And another life came, ere I knew he was safe, and my own was over and gone. And now I lie helpless here, and shall never rise up again; I grow weaker and weaker, day by day, till my weakness itself is a pain. Every morning the slow dawn creeps; every evening I see from my bed The orange-gold fade into lifeless gray, and the old evening star overhead. Sometimes by the twilight dim, or the awful birth of the day, As I lie, very still, not asleep nor awake, my soul seems to flutter away; And I float far beyond the stars, till I thrill with a rapturous pain, And the feeble touch of a tiny hand recalls me to life again. And the doctor says she will live. Ah! 'tis hard to leave her alone, And to think she will never know, in the world, the love of the mother who's gone. They will tell her of me, by-and-by, and perhaps she will shed me a tear; But if I should stoop to her bed in the night, she would start with a horrible fear. She will grow into girlhood, I trust, and will bask in the light of love, And I, if I gain to see her at all, shall only look on from above. I shall see her and cannot aid, though she fall into evil and woe. Ah, how can the angels find heart to rejoice, when they think of their dear ones below? And Francis, he too will forget me, and go on the journey of life; And I hope, though I dare not think of it yet, will take him another wife‚Äî It will hardly be Patience, I think, though she liked him in days gone by. Was that why she came? But what thoughts are these for one who is soon to die? I hope he will come ere I go, though I feel no longer the thirst For the sound of his voice and the light of his eye, which I used to feel at first. 'Tis not that I care for him less, but death dries, with a finger of fire, The tender springs of innocent love and the torrents of strong desire. And I know we shall meet again. I have done many things that are wrong, But surely the Lord of Life and of Love cannot bear to be angry long. I am only a girl of eighteen, and have had no teacher but love; And, it may be, the sorrow and pain I have known will be counted for me above. For I doubt if the minister knows all the depths of the goodness of God, When he says, He is jealous of earthly love, and bids me bow down 'neath the rod. He is learn√®d and wise, I know, but somehow to dying eyes God opens the secret doors of the shrine that are closed to the learn√®d and wise. So now I am ready to go, for I know He will do what is best, Though He call me away while the sun is on high, like a child sent early to rest. I should like him to see her first, though the yearning is over and past: But what is that footstep upon the stair? Oh, my darling at last, at last! DEAR LITTLE HAND. Dear little hand that clasps my own, Embrowned with toil and seamed with strife; Pink little fingers not yet grown To the poor strength of after-life,‚Äî Dear little hand! Dear little eyes which smile on mine With the first peep of morning light; Now April-wet with tears, or fine With dews of pity, or laughing bright. Dear little eyes! Dear little voice, whose broken speech All eloquent utterance can transcend; Sweet childish wisdom strong to reach A holier deep than love or friend: Dear little voice! Dear little life! my care to keep From every spot and stain of sin; Sweet soul foredoomed, for joy or pain, To struggle and‚Äîwhich? to fail or win? Dread mystical life! STILL WATERS. A cruel little stream I know, Which slowly, slowly crawls between The ooze banks, fringed with sedges green, That serve to bind its feeble flow. So sheltered that no passing breath Of west-wind stirs it; nay, the blast Which strips the tall elms and is past, Scarce wakes to life its race of death. On its black surface year by year The marsh flowers, grown untimely old, Shed their soft petals like a tear, And hopeless drown their faded gold. Deep in its darkling depths the pike Darts with his cruel jaws; by night The black eels, sinuous, serpent-like, Twist like fell ghosts that fear the light. Spring shuns it, summer loves it not; The low fat fields are lit with bloom, But here the watery sedges rot, And all the months are clothed with gloom. Autumn's first footstep sears to brown Its coarse green fringe; the first cold breath, Ere yet the oak-leaf flutters down, Binds its dull life in icy death. I hate, I hate you, crawling stream! Dumb, creeping, murderous wretch, I long To see the sunlit ripples gleam, To hear the torrent's jubilant song. But you, dull monster, all the years Lie rolling on your sullen flood, And take your fill of mortal tears; Yet, like the Churchmen, spill not blood. The dark gap in the ice, the boat Keel upward, or the drifting oar; Or, like of old, the little coat, The white clothes heaped upon the shore; And some young life is over and gone, And some fond heart is broken in twain; And you flow smoothly, smoothly on, Taking no heed for death or pain. They come and grapple with hooks until They reach the slimy deep, where lies The white thing, very cold and still, With death's gaze in its stony eyes. And you just make a ripple, and then Flow smoothly onward: you who slew Young innocent lives of painted men, Long ere the crowded city grew; And shall in far years yet to be, Pierce unborn mothers with that sharp pain, Which only a mother feels when he Who was her first-born comes again, A clay-cold heap. I would that I Had but the archangel's flaming brand; So would I burn thy dull springs dry, And choke thy flow with hills of sand. Yet why? Whatever soft souls prate, Babbling of universal good, Love is the sister-child of hate, And all good things are bought with blood. Virtue were not if vice were not, Nor darkness if there were not light. Creep on; fulfil thy murderous lot; For Wrong has equal life with Right. IN REGENT STREET. One of the nightly hundreds who pass Wearily, hopelessly, under the gas. But the old sad words had a strange new tone, And the wild laugh seemed to sink to a moan. So that turning as one constrained to look, The strange sight stifled the voice of rebuke: For I looked on a girl's face pure and fair, Blue-eyed, and crowned with a glory of hair, Such as my dead child-sister might own, Were she not a child still, but a woman grown; Full of the tender graces that come To the cherished light of an ancient home; Even to that touch of a high disdain, Which is born of a name without blot or stain. Strange; as if one should chance to meet An angel of light in that sordid street! ‚ÄúO child, what misery brings you here, To this place of vileness and weeping and fear?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am no more than the rest,‚Äù she said, Proudly averting her beautiful head! Then no response, till some kinder word Stole in unawares, and her heart was stirred. ‚ÄúI was a wife but the other day, Now I am left without hope or stay! ‚ÄúWork did I ask? What work is for you? What work can those delicate fingers do? ‚ÄúService? But how could I bear to part From the child with whom I had left my heart? ‚ÄúAlms?‚ÄîYes, at first; then a pitiless No: The State would provide me whither to go. ‚ÄúBut in sordid prisons it laid my head With the thief and the harlot; therefore I fled. ‚ÄúOne thing alone had I lest untried, Then I put off the last rag of pride.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat came? ‚ÄòYou were of an honoured race, Now you must live with your own disgrace.‚Äô ‚ÄúBut many will buy where few will give, And I die every day that my child may live.‚Äù Motherly love sunk to this! Ah, well, Teach they not how He went down into hell: Only blind me in heart and brain, Or ever I look on the like again. FROM THE DESERT. Thou hast visited me with Thy storms, And the vials of Thy sore displeasure Thou hast poured on my head, like a bitter draught Poured forth without stint or measure; Thou hast bruised me as flax is bruised; Made me clay in the potter's wheel; Thou hast hardened Thy face like steel, And cast down my soul to the ground; Burnt my life in the furnace of fire, like dross, And left me in prison where souls are bound: Yet my gain is more than my loss. What if Thou hadst led my soul To the pastures where dull souls feed; And set my steps in smooth paths, far away From the feet of those that bleed; Penned me in low, fat plains, Where the air is as still as death, And Thy great winds are sunk to a breath, And Thy torrents a crawling stream, And the thick steam of wealth goes up day and night, Till Thy sun gives a veil√®d light, And heaven shows like a vanished dream! What if Thou hadst set my feet With the rich in a gilded room; And made me to sit where the scorners sit, Scoffing at death and doom! What if I had hardened my heart With dark counsels line upon line; And blunted my soul with meat and wine, Till my ears had grown deaf to the bitter cry Of the halt and the weak and the impotent; Nor hearkened, lapt in a dull content, To the groanings of those who die! My being had waxed dull and dead With the lusts of a gross desire; But now Thou hast purged me throughly, and burnt My shame with a living fire. So burn me, and purge my will Till no vestige of self remain, And I stand out white without spot or stain. Then let Thy flaming angel at last Smite from me all that has been before; And sink me, freed from the load o? the past, In Thy dark depths evermore. DUMB. All men are poets if they might but tell The dim ineffable changes which the sight Of natural beauty works on them: the charm Of those first days of Spring, when life revives And all the world is bloom: the white-fringed green Of summer seas swirling around the base Of overhanging cliffs; the golden gleam Seen from some breezy hill, where far and wide The fields grow ripe for harvest; or the storm Smiting the leaden surf, or echoing On nightly lakes and unsuspected hills, Revealed in lurid light; or first perceived, High in mid-heaven, above the rosy clouds, The everlasting snows. And Art can move, To higher minds, an influence as great As Nature's self; when the rapt gazer marks The stainless mother folding arms divine Around the Eternal Child, or pitying love Nailed to the dreadful cross, or the white strength Of happy heathen gods, or serpent coils Binding the agonized limbs, till from their pain Is born a thing of beauty for all time. And more than Nature, more than Art can move The awakened soul‚Äîheroic soaring deeds; When the young champion falls in hopeless fight, Striking for home; or when, by truth constrained, The martyr goes forth cheerful to his fate‚Äî The dungeon, or the torture, or, more hard, The averted gaze of friends, the loss of love, The loneliness of soul, which truth too oft Gives to reward the faith which casts aside All things for her; or saintly lives obscure, Spent in a sweet compassion, till they gain, Living, some glow of heaven; or passionate love, Bathing our poor world in a mystic light, Seen once, then lost for ever. These can stir Life to its depths, till silence grows a load Too hard to bear, and the rapt soul would fain Speak with strange tongues which startle as they come, Like the old saints who spake at Pentecost. But we are dumb, we are dumb, and may not tell What stirs within us, though the soul may throb And tremble with its passion, though the heart Dissolve in weeping: dumb. Nature may spread Sublimest sights of beauty; Art inspire High thoughts and pure of God-like sacrifice; Yet no word comes. Heroic daring deeds Thrill us, yet no word comes; we are dumb, we are dumb, Save that from finer souls at times may rise, Once in an age, faint inarticulate sounds, Low halting tones of wonder, such as come From children looking on the stars, but still With power to open to the listening ear The Fair Divine Unknown, and to unseal Heaven's inner gates before us evermore. Ah, sew and far between! The earth grows green, Art's glorious message speaks from year to year, Great deeds and high are done from day to day, But the voice comes not which has power to wake The sleeping soul within, and animate The beauty which informs them, lending speech To what before was dumb. They come, they go, Those sweet impressions spent on separate souls, Like raindrops on the endless ocean-plains, Lost as they fall. The world rolls on; lives spring, Blossom, and fade; the play of life is played More vivid than of old‚Äîa wider stage, With more consummate actors; yet the dull, Cold deeps of sullen silence swallow up The strain, and it is lost. But if we might Paint all things as they are, find voice to speak The thoughts now mute within us, let the soul Trace on its sensitive surface vividly, As does the sun our features, all the play Of passion, all the changesul tides of thought, The mystery, the beauty, the delight, The fear, the horror, of our lives,‚Äîour being Would blaze up heavenward in a sudden flame, Spend itself, and be lost. Wherefore 'tis well This narrow boundary that hedges in The strong and weak alike. Thought could not live, Nor speech, in that pure √¶ther which girds round Life's central dwelling-place. Only the dull And grosser atmosphere of earth it is Which vibrates to the sweet birds' song, and brings Heaven to the wondering ear. Only the stress, The pain, the hope, the longing, the constraint Of limited faculties circling round and round The grim circumference, and finding naught Of outlet to the dread unknown beyond, Can lend the poet voice. Only the weight, The dulness of our senses, which makes dumb And hushes half the finer utterance, Makes possible the song, and modulates The too exalted music, that it falls So sost upon the listening soul, that life, Not withered by the awful harmony, Nor drunk with too much sweetness, nor struck blind By the too vivid presence of the Unknown, Fulfils its round of duty‚Äîelevated, Not slain by too much splendour‚Äîcomforted, Not thunder-smitten‚Äîsoothed, not laid asleep‚Äî And ever, through the devious maze of being, Fares in slow narrowing cycles to the end. FAITH WITHOUT SIGHT. No angel comes to us to tell Glad news of our belov√®d dead; Nor at the old familiar board, They sit among us, breaking bread. Three days we wait before the tomb, Nay, life-long years; and yet no more, For all our passionate tears, we find The stone rolled backward from the door. Yet are they risen as He is risen; For no eternal loss we grieve. Bless√®d are they who ask no sign, And, never having seen, believe. CAGED. Alas for fame! I saw a genius sit, Draining full bumpers with a trembling hand, And roll out rhapsodies of folly, lit By soaring fancies hard to understand. Lonely he seemed, whom all men should admire; And some were there who sneered a covert sneer, Quenching with logic cold the sacred fire; And one who hardly checked a rising tear Because life's order binds with chains of steel The struggling individual soul; because The fair fine flower of life doth oft conceal A hidden worm which always frets and gnaws The inner heart from which all perfumes come, And round the deep-set core of golden fire Foul creeping creatures make their constant home‚Äî Black hatred, wild revolt, and gross desire. What is this bar that Nature loves to place Before the too aspiring heart and brain,‚Äî Bringing down goodly hopes to deep disgrace, Keeping high pleasure balanced by low pain, Pure thoughts by secret failings, subtler joys With grosser sense or hopeless depths of woe,‚Äî Setting our lives in barren counterpoise, Which says, Thus far, no further shalt thou go. Is it that Nature, envious of her own, Even as the fabled gods of primal years, Because to too great stature it is grown, Hates her consummate work, and inly fears Lest the soul, once enfranchised, soar too high, Up to some Spiritual place of Souls, Where the world's feeble echoes faint and die, And in fine waves a purer √¶ther rolls? There is no infinite in Nature. All Is finite, set within a self-made bound. Thought builds round space itself a brazen wall, And hates the barren cycle's endless round. Life grown too perfect is not life at all; Some hidden discords sweeten every strain; No virtue is, where is no power to fall, Nor true delight without a touch of pain. And this it is that limits evermore The life of man to this its low estate, And gives the soul's light pinions power to soar Only a little space toward heaven's gate. Creatures we are of the earth, and not the sky, Bound down, constrained, confined; and yet 'tis well: No angel's wings are ours to mount on high, No chains have power to keep our souls in hell. And since to realms of thought we may aspire, Higher than these in which we breathe and are, And know within the same creative fire As that which lights and warms the furthest star, So should our restless spirits grow content With what is theirs, nor covet to be free; Since boundless power is oft most impotent, And narrow bonds the truest liberty. TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE. Oh, if we had but eyes to see The glory which around us lies, To read the secrets of the earth, And know the splendours of the skies; And if we had but ears to hear The psalm of life which upward rolls From desert tent and city street, From every meeting-place of souls; And if we had but tongues to tell The dumb thoughts that shall ne'er be heard, The inarticulate prayers which rise From hearts by passionate yearnings stirred,‚Äî Our souls would parch, like Semele's, When her dread Lord blazed forth confessed. Ah, sometimes too much knowledge blights, And ignorance indeed is blest! ON A FLIGHT OF LADY-BIRDS. Over the summer sea, Floating on delicate wings, Comes an unnumbered host Of beautiful fragile things; Whence they have come, or what Blind impulse has forced them here, What still voice marshalled them out Over wide seas without fear, You cannot tell, nor I. But to-day the air is thick With these strangers from far away: On hot piers and drifting ships The weary travellers stay. On the sands where to-night they will drown, On the busy waterside street, Trampled in myriads down By the careless wayfarers' feet The beautiful creatures lie. Who knows what myriads have sunk To drown in the oily waves, Till all our sea-side world shows Like a graveyard crowded with graves? Humble creatures and small, How shall the Will which sways This enormous unresting ball, Through endless cycles of days, Take thought for them or care? And yet, if the greatest of kings, With the wisest of sages combined, Never could both devise‚Äî Strong arm and inventive mind‚Äî So wondrous a shining coat, Such delicate wings and free, As have these small creatures which float Over the breathless sea On this summer morning so fair. And the life, the wonderful life, Which not all the wisdom of earth Can give to the humblest creature that moves The mystical process of birth‚Äî The nameless principle which doth lurk Far away beyond atom, or monad, or cell, And is truly His own most marvellous work‚Äî Was it good to give it, or, given, well To squander it thus away? For surely a man might think So precious a gift and grand‚Äî God's essence in part‚Äîshould be meted out With a thrifty and grudging hand. And hard by, on the yellowing corn, Myriads of tiny jaws Are bringing the husbandman's labour to scorn, And the cankerworm frets and gnaws, Which was made for these for a prey. For a prey for these? but, oh! Who shall read us the riddle of life‚Äî The prodigal waste, which naught can redress But a cycle of sorrow and strife, The continual sequence of pain, The perpetual triumph of wrong, The whole creation in travail to make A victory for the strong, And not with frail insects alone? For is not the scheme worked out Among us who are raised so high? Are there no wasted minds among men‚Äî No hearts that aspire and sigh For the hopes which the years steal away, For the labour they love, and its meed of fame, And feel the bright blade grow rusted within, Or are born to inherited shame, And a portion with those that groan? How are we fettered and caged Within our dark prison-house here! We are made to look for a loving plan; We find everywhere sorrow and fear. We look for the triumph of Good; And, from all the wide world around, The lives that are spent cry upward to heaven, From the slaughter-house of the ground, Till we feel that Evil is lord. And yet are we bound to believe, Because all our nature is so, In a Ruler touched by an infinite ruth For all His creatures below. Bound, though a mocking fiend point To the waste, and ruin, and pain‚Äî Bound, though our souls should be bowed in despair‚Äî Bound, though wrong triumph again and again, And we cannot answer a word. ON AN OLD MINSTER. Old minster, when my years were few, And life seemed endless to the boy; Clear yet and vivid is the joy With which I gazed and thought on you. Thin shaft and flower-wrought capital, High-springing arch, and blazoned pane, Quaint gurgoyles stretching heads profane, And stately throne and carven stall. The long nave lost in vaporous gray, The mailed recumbent forms which wait, In mockery of earthly state, The coming of the dreadful day. The haunted aisles, the gathering gloom, By some stray shaft of eve made fair: The stillness of the mouldering air, The faded legends of the tomb. I loved them all. What care had I,‚Äî I, the young heir of all the Past,‚Äî That neither youth nor life might last, That all things living came to die! The Past was spent, the Past was done, The Present was my own to hold; Far off within a haze of gold Stretched the fair Future, scarce begun. For me did pious builders rear Those reverend walls; for me the song Of supplication, ages long, Had gone up daily, year by year. And thus I loved you; but to-day The long Past near and nearer shows; Less bright, more clear, the Future grows, And all the world is turning gray. But you scarce bear a deeper trace Of time upon your solemn brow; No sadder, stiller, grayer now, Than when I loved your reverend face. And you shall be when I am not; And you shall be a thing of joy To many a frank and careless boy When I and mine are long forgot. Grave priests shall here with holy rage, Whose grandsires are as yet unborn, Lash, with fierce stripes of saintly scorn, The heats of youth, the greed of age. Proud prelates sit on that high throne, Whose young forefathers drive the plough While Norman lineage nods below, In way-worn tramp or withered crone. And white-haired traders feign to pray, Sunk deep in thoughts of gain and gold; And sweet flower-faces growing old, Give place to fresher blooms than they. With such new shape of creed and rite As none now living may foretell; A faith of love which needs not hell, A stainless worship, pure and white. Or, may be, some reverting change To the old faith of vanished days: The incensed air, the mystic praise, The barbarous ritual, quaint and strange. Who knows? But they are wrong who say Man's work is brief and quickly past; If you through all these centuries last, While they who built you pass away. The wind, the rain, the sand, are slow; Man fades before his work; scant trace Time's finger findeth to efface Of him whom seventy years lay low. The grass grows green awhile, and then Is as before; the work he made Casts on his grave a reverend shade Through long successive lives of men. But he! where is he? Lo, his name Has vanished from his wonted place, Unknown his tongue, his creed, his race; Unknown his soaring hopes of fame. Only the creatures of the brain,‚Äî Just laws, wise precepts, deathless verse; These weave a chaplet for the hearse, And through all change unchanged remain. These will I love as age creeps on; Gray minster, these are ever young; These shall be read and loved and sung When every stone of you is gone. No hands have built the monument Which to all ages shall endure; High thoughts, and fancies sweet and pure Lives in the quest of goodness spent. These, though no visible forms confine Their spiritual essence fair; Are deathless as the soul they bear, And, as its Maker is, divine. THE BITTER HARVEST. Who reaps the harvest of his soul, And garners up thought's golden grain, For him in vain life's tempests rave, Fate's rude shocks buffet him in vain. The storms which shipwreck feebler souls, Beat harmlessly on him; the wind, Which whirls away the domes of pride, Braces the sinews of his mind. He is set within a tower of strength, Beyond thick walls and cloisters still; Where, as he sits, no faintest breath Stirs the smooth current of his will. He is stretched in a smiling valley, where, When hills are dark, the full sun shines; Brings gold upon the waving fields, And purple clusters on the vines. He lies in a boundless sylvan shade, While all the fields are parched around; And hears a sweet bird, singing, singing, With one clear monotone of sound. Far, far away from the busy crowd And chaffering of the mart, he stands, Like a statue on a lonely hill, Pondering a scroll within its hands. Or one who, from high convent walls, Looks down at eve upon the plain, And sees the children at their sport, And turns to chant and prayer again; So rich, and yet so very poor, So fruitful, yet so void of fruit; Removed from human hopes and fears, Far as the man is from the brute; So troubled, 'neath a face of calm; So bound with chains, though seeming free; So dead, though with a name to live, That it were better not to be. OF LOVE AND SLEEP. I saw Sleep stand by an enchanted wood, Thick lashes drooping o'er her heavy eyes: Leaning against a flower-cupped tree she stood, The night air gently breathed with slumbrous sighs. Such cloak of silence o'er the world was spread, As on Nile sands enshrouds the mighty dead. About her birds were dumb, and blooms were bowed, And a thick heavy sweetness filled the air; White robed she seemed; and hidden as in a cloud, A star-like jewel in her raven hair. Downward to earth her cold torch would she turn With feeble fires that might no longer burn. And in her languid limbs and loosened zone Such beauty dwelt; and in her rippling hair, As of old time was hers, and hers alone, The mother of gods and men, divinely fair; When whiter than white foam or sand she lay, The fairest thing beneath the eye of day. To her came Love, a comely youth and strong, Fair as the morning of a day in June; Around him breathed a jocund air of song, And his limbs moved as to a joyous tune: With golden locks blown back, and eyes aflame, To where the sleeping maiden leant, he came. Then they twain passed within that mystic grove Together, and with them I, myself unseen. Oh, strange, sweet land! wherein all men may prove The things they would, the things which might have been; Hopeless hopes blossom, withered youth revives, And sunshine comes again to darkened lives. What sights were theirs in that blest wonder-land? See, the white mountain-summits, framed in cloud, Redden with sunset; while below them stand The solemn pine-woods like a funeral crowd; And lower still the vineyards twine, and make A double vintage in the tranquil lake. Or, after storm-tost nights, on some sea isle The sudden tropical morning bursts; and lo! Bright birds and feathery palms, the green hills smile, Strange barks, with swarthy crews, dart to and fro; And on the blue bay, glittering like a crown, The white domes of some fair historic town. Or, they fare northward ever, northward still, At midnight, under the unsetting sun; O'er endless snows, from hill to icy hill, Where silence reigns with death, and life is done: Till from the North a sweet wind suddenly; And hark! the warm waves of the fabulous sea. Or, some still eve, when summer days are long, And the mown hay is sweet, and wheat is green, They hear some wood-bird sing the old fair song Of joys to be, greater than yet have been; Stretched 'neath the snowy hawthorn, till the star, Hung high in heaven, warns them that home is far. Or, on the herbless, sun-struck hills, by night, Under the silent peaks, they hear the loud Wild flutes; and onward, by the ghostly light, Whirled in nude dances, sweeps the maddened crowd; Till the fierce eddy seize them, and they prove The shame, the rapture, of unfettered love. Or, by the sacred hearth they seem to sit, While firelight gleams on many a sunny head; At that fair hour, before the lamp is lit, When hearts are fullest, though no word be said,‚Äî When the world fades, and rank and wealth and fame, Seem, matched with this, no better than a name. All these they knew! and then a breeze of day Stirred the dark wood; and then they seemed to come Forth with reluctant feet among the gray, Bare fields, unfanciful; and all the flame Was burnt from out Love's eyes, and from his hair, And his smooth cheek was marked with lines of care. And paler showed the maid, more pure and white And holier than before. But when I said, ‚ÄúSweet eyes, be opened;‚Äù lo, the unveil√®d sight Was as the awful vision of the dead! Then knew I, breathing slow, with difficult breath, That Love was one with Life, and Sleep with Death. BLIND. The girl who from her father's door Sees the cold storm-cloud sweep the sea, Cries, wrestling with her anguish sore, My love! my love! ah, where is he? And locks her fears within her breast, Sickening; while 'neath the breathless blaze He lies, and dreams, in broken rest, Of homely faces,‚Äîhappier days. But when a calm is on the deep, And scarcely from the quivering blue, The waves' soft murmur, half asleep, Speaks hope that he is well, and true: The brave ship sinks to rise no more Beneath the thunderous surge; and he, A pale corpse floating on the sea, Or dashed like seaweed on the shore. TO HER PICTURE. As one who on a lonely bed of pain Feels the soft hand he felt when he was young; Or, who at eve, on some far Eastern plain, Hears the old songs once by his mother sung: So to me, looking on thy portrait, dear, Thou and my youth and love are ever near. It may be that the painter failed to show, How should he not? the soul within thine eyes,‚Äî Their blue unruffled depths, thy cheeks aglow With virgin blushes that unbidden rise; Thy coral lips, thy white neck, round, and fair, Or the sweet prodigal auburn of thy hair. How should he? Not for him thou wast, but me; Love shot no sudden splendour in his eyes; Love guided not his hand, content to see Mere beauty, as of sunset-hills or skies; Nor soothed his dull ear with the mystic strain, Heard once a life, and nevermore again. Only the lovely shell he saw; the cloak, The perfect vesture of the hidden soul. Not for his eyes thy slumbering angel woke, Stretched in deep sleep, where love's broad waters roll: Had he but seen her wings of silver move, He had forgot to paint, and learned to love. Yet is his skill to me for ever blest, For that which it has left of grace and truth; Those sweet eyes shine, yet need no time of rest, Still thy fair cheek retains its rounded youth. In wakeful nights I light my lamp, and know The same dear face I knew long years ago. Yet worn am I, too old for love, and gray. Too faithful heart, thou shouldst not still abide With such as I, nor longer deign to stay: These are the follies wiser worldlings chide. Thou wouldst transfer those glances, wert thou wise, To younger lives and more responsive eyes. Ah! no, remain; not thus you looked of yore; Another, perhaps more worthy, bore the prize; I could not tell you then the love I bore, Or read the soft requital in your eyes; Now no change comes, now thou art always kind, Then thou wast cold and changeful as the wind. THE RETURN. He stood above the well-known shore; Behind, the sea stretched dull and gray: And slowly with the breeze of morn The great ship forged away. Almost he wished she might return, And speed him to some further change; The old scenes greeted him again, And yet all things were strange. There were the dreams he used to dream In the long nights when day was here; The shady Sunday path to church, The winding brooklet clear. The woods with violets blue in Spring, The fallow where they chased the hare, The gable peeping through the elms, All filled him with despair. For all was there except the past‚Äî The past, his youth for dross had sold! The past which after-years in vain Prize more than all their gold. Then age fell on him with a flash, Time smote him, and his soul grew gray, And thoughts in busier scenes unknown, Chased youth and hope away. The past, which seemed so near before, A step might gain it, came to be A low cloud sunk beyond a gulf, Wider than any sea. Nor what the present had in store, Knowing; at last his great suspense Grew to a bitter load of pain, Too great for mortal sense. So, by the well-known paths at last, He gained the well-remembered door, Sick for a voice which he should hear, Ah! never, never, more Strange children round, a stranger's face Of wonder, so the dream was o'er. He turned; the dead past comes not back. No, never, never, more. FOR EVER. For ever and for ever The changeless oceans roar: And dash their thundering surges down Upon the sounding shore: Yet this swift soul, this lightning will, Shall these, while they roll on, be still? For ever and for ever The eternal mountains rise, And lift their virgin snows on high To meet the silent skies. Yet shall this soul which measures all, While these stand steadfast, sink and fall? For ever and for ever The swift suns roll through space; From age to age they wax and wane, Each in its ordered place: Yet shall this soul, whose inner eye Foretells their cycles, fade and die? For ever and for ever We have been, and we are, Unchanging as the ocean wave, Unresting as the star: Though suns stand still, and time be o'er, We are, and shall be, evermore. BEHIND THE VEIL. I paced along The dim cathedral wrapped in reverend gloom: I heard the sweet child's song Spring upwards like a fountain; and the boom Of the tempestuous organ-music swell; The hushed low voices and the silvery bell; The incense-laden air; the kneeling throng: I knew them all, and seemed to hear the cry Of countless myriads, rising deep and strong,‚Äî Help us! we faint, we die. Our knees are weak, our eyes are blind; We seek what we shall never find. Show but Thy face, and we are Thine, Unknown, Ineffable, Divine! I heard the loud Muezzin from the slender minaret call ‚ÄúTo prayer, To prayer;‚Äù and lo! the busy crowd, Merchant and prince and water-carrier, all Turned from the world, and, rapt in worship, knelt, Facing the holy city; and I felt That from those myriads kneeling, prostrate, bowed, A low moan rises to the throne on high,‚Äî Not shut out quite by error's thickest cloud,‚Äî Help us! we faint, we die. Our knees are weak, our eyes are blind; We seek what we shall never find. Show but Thy face, and we are Thine, Unknown, Ineffable, Divine. I stood before The glaring temples on the burning plain; I heard the hideous roar Rise to the stars to drown the shrieks of pain, What time the murderous idol swept along. I listened to the innocent, mystic song, Breathed to the jewelled Lotus evermore, In the elder lands, through the ages, like a sigh, And heard in low, sweet chant, and hateful roar,‚Äî Help us! we faint, we die. Our knees are weak, our eyes are blind; We seek what we shall never find. Show but Thy face, and we are Thine, Unknown, Ineffable, Divine! Ay: everywhere Echoes the same exceeding bitter cry. Yet can the Father bear To hide His presence from the children's eye; Lets loose on good and bad the plague and sword; And though wrong triumph, answers not a word? Only deep down in the heart doth He declare His constant presence; there, though the outward sky Be darkened, shines a little speck of fair,‚Äî A light which cannot die. Though knees be weak, and eyes be blind; Though we may seek, and never find; Here doth His hidden glory shine, Unknown, Ineffable, Divine! VISIONS. Oft in the blazing summer noon, And oft beneath the frosty moon, When earth and air were hushed and still, And absolute silence seemed to fill The farthest border-lands of space, I loved in childish thought to trace Glimpses of change, which might transform The voiceless calm to furious storm; Broke the dull spell, which comes to bind In after-years the sluggish mind; And pictured, borne on fancy's wings, The end of all created things. Then have I seen with dreaming eye, The blue depths of the vaulted sky Rent without noise; and in their stead A wonder-world of fancy spread, A golden city, with domes and spires, Lit by a strange sun's mystic fires. Portals of dazzling chrysolite, Long colonnades of purest white; Streets paved with gold and jewels rare; And higher, in the ambient air, A shining Presence undefined: Swift seraphs stooping swift as wind From pole to pole, and that vast throng Which peopled Dante's world of song; The last great inquest which shall close The tale of human joys and woes; The dreadful Judge, the opening tomb, And all the mystery of doom. Then woke to find the vision vain, And sun or moon shine calm again. No longer, save in memory's glass, These vanished visions come and pass; The clearer light of fuller day Has chased these earlier dreams away. Faith's eye grows dim with too much light, And fancy flies our clearer sight. But shall we mourn her day is o'er, That these rapt visions come no more? Nay; knowledge has its splendours too, Brighter than Fancy's brightest hue. I gaze now on the heavens, and see How, midst their vast immensity, By cosmic laws the planets roll, Sped onwards by a central soul; How farther still, and still more far, World beyond world, star beyond star, So many, and so far, that speech And thought must fail the sum to reach. This universe of nature teems With things more strange than fancy's dreams; And so at length, with clearer eye, Soar beyond childhood's painted sky, Up to the Lord of great and small, Not onewhere, but pervading all: Who made the music of the spheres, And yet inclines an ear that hears The faintest prayer, the humblest sigh, The strong man's groan, the childish cry; Who guides the stars, yet without whom No humblest floweret comes to bloom, No lowliest creature comes to birth, No dead leaf flutters to the earth: Who breathed into our souls the breath, Which neither time nor change nor death, Nor hurtling suns at random hurled And dashed together, world on world, Can ever kill or quench, till He Bends down, and bids them not to be. DOUBT. Who but has seen Once in his life, when youth and health ran high, The fair, clear face of truth Grow dark to his eye? Who but has known Cold mists of doubt and icy questionings Creep round him like a nightmare, blotting out The sight of better things. A hopeless hour, When all the voices of the soul are dumb, When o'er the tossing seas No ligh may come, When God and right Are gone, and seated on the empty throne Are dull philosophies and words of wind, Making His praise their own. Better than this, The burning sins of youth, the old man's greed, Than thus to live inane; To sit and read, And with blind brain Daily to treasure up a deadly doubt, And live a life from which the light has fled, And faith's pure fire gone out. Until at last, For some blest souls, but never here for all, Burns out a sudden light, And breaks the thrall, And doubt has fled, And the soul rises, with a clearer sight For this its pain, its sorrow, its despair, To God and truth and right. Plead we for those Gently and humbly, as befitteth men On whom the same chill shade Broods now as then. So shall they learn How an eternal wisdom rules above, And all the cords of Being are bound fast To an unfailing love. ST. DAVID'S HEAD. Salt sprays deluge it, wild waves buffet it, hurricanes rave; Summer and winter, the depths of the ocean girdle it round; In leaden dawns, in golden noon-tides, in silvery moonlight Never it ceases to hear the old sea's mystical sound. Surges vex it evermore By gray cave and sounding shore. Think of the numberless far-away centuries, long before man, When the hot earth with monsters teemed, and with monsters the deep, And the red sun loomed faint, and the moon was caught fast in the motionless air, And the warm waves seethed through the haze in a secular sleep. Rock was here and headland then, Ere the little lives of men. Over it long the mastodons crashed through the tropical forest, And the great bats swooped overhead through the half-defined blue; Then they passed, and the hideous ape-man, speechless and half-erect, Through weary ages of time tore and gibbered and slew. Grayer skies and chiller air, But the self-same rock was there. Then the savage came and went, and Briton and Roman and Saxon, Till our England grew rich and great, and her white sails covered the sea; Thus through all this long story of ours, civil progress and vanquished foeman, From Crecy to Trafalgar, from the bondsman down to the free, Still those dark rocks, and beneath Keeps the sea its face of death. So it shall be when the tide of our greatness has ebbed to the shallows; So when there floats not a ship on this storm-tossed westerly main, Hard by, the minster crumbles, the city has shrunk to a village; Thus shall we shrink one day, and our forests be pathless again; And the headland stern shall stand, Guarding an undiscovered land. Vex it, O changeless ocean; rave round it, tempests unceasing; Sink it, great earthquakes, deep in the depths of the fathomless sea; Burn them, fierce fires of the centre, burn rock and ocean together, Till the red globe flare throughout space, through the ages to be. Cease, make an end, dull world, begone. How shall I cease while you roll on? Time, oh, horrible! Space, oh, terrible! Infinite Void! Dreadful abysses of Being! blighting a finite brain; How shall the creatures of thought subsist, when the thinker ceases? Begone, dull figments, be done! not alone shall you dare to remain. Without me you yourselves must fall; I hold the measure of you all. IN VOLHYNIA. In Volhynia the peasant mothers, When spring-time brings back the leaves, And the first swallows dart and twitter Under the cottage eaves,‚Äî Sit mute at their windows, and listen, With eyes brimming over with tears, To the broken sounds which are wafted To their eager watching ears. And throw out bread and honey To the birds as they scintillate by; And hearts full of yearning and longing, Borne out on the wings of a sigh. For they think that their dear lost children, The little ones who are gone, Come back thus to the heartsick mothers Who are toiling and sorrowing on. And those sun-lit wings and flashing White breasts, to their tear-dimmed eyes Bring visions of white child-angels Floating in Paradise. And again to the sounds they hearken, Grown silent while incomplete, The music of childish laughter, The patter of baby feet. Till the hearts which are barren and childless, The homes which are empty and cold: The nests whence the young have departed, Are filled with young life as of old. Thus each spring, to those peasant mothers, Comes the old Past again and again; And those sad hearts quicken and blossom, In a rapture of sorrowless pain. THE LIVING PAST. O faithful souls that watch and yearn, Expectant of the coming light, With kindling hearts and eyes that burn With hope to see the rule of right; The time of peace and of good will, When the thick clouds of wrong and pain Roll up as from a shining hill, And never more descend again; The perfect day, the golden year, The end of sorrow and of sighs; Whether the heavenly change be here, Or far beyond the sunset skies,‚Äî I cherish you, I love your faith, I long with you that this may be; But hark, a dreary voice which saith, ‚ÄúVain dreamer, what were it to thee!‚Äù For though the blest hour strike before Another sunrise vex the earth, And pain and evil rule no more, But vanish in the newer birth,‚Äî Though war and hatred come to cease, And sorrow be no more, nor sin, And in their stead an endless peace Its fair unbroken reign begin,‚Äî What comfort have ye? What shall blot The memories of bitter years, Of joys which have been, but are not, And floods of unforgotten tears? The painful records graven clear On carven rock or deathless page; The long unceasing reign of fear, The weary tale of lust and rage; The ills whose dark sum baffles thought, Done day by day beneath the sun? ‚ÄúThat which is done,‚Äù the old sage taught, ‚ÄúNot God Himself can make undone.‚Äù For that which has been, still must live, And 'neath the shallow Present last. Oh, who will sweet oblivion give, Who free us from the dreadful Past? CHANGES. You see that tall house opposite? Three times within the fleeting year, Since last the summer-time was here, Great changes have gone over it. For first a bridal bright and gay Filled the long street with riotous sound; And amid smiles from all around, The newly-wedded passed away. And when the violets came once more, And lambs were born, a concourse went, Still gayer, still more innocent, To christening from that stately door. And now the mute house dull and drear, From blinded eyes, stares blank and white; And amid dust and glaring light, The black lines slowly disappear, ALONE. What shall it profit a man To have stood by the source of things, To have spent the fair years of his youthful prime In mystical questionings; To have scaled the lovely height, While his brothers slept below; To have seen the vision bright Which but few on earth may know,‚Äî If when his task be done He lives his life alone? If in the busy street None come whom he may greet? If in his lonely room With the night the shadows deepen into ghostly shapes of gloom? It may be his soul may say, ‚ÄúI have gained me a splendid dower; I can look around on the toiling crowd, With the pride of a conscious power. I can hear the passer-by Tell of all my world-wide fame; I have friends I shall not see Who dwell fondly on my name. If the sweet smile of wife Light not my joyless life, If to my silent home No childish laughter come, Shall I no solace find In communion with the monarchs of the fair broad realm of mind?‚Äù But when sickness wears him, or age Creeps on, and his soul doth yearn For the tender hand and the soothing voice That shall never more return When the lessening throng of friends, Not unkind, but each one set Safe within white walls of home, All the world without forget,‚Äî Shall not old memories rise 'Twixt book and weary eyes, Till knowledge come to seem A profitless vague dream? Shall not he sometimes sigh For the careless past unlearn√®d, and the happy days gone by? Ah! not to be happy alone, Are men sent, or to be glad. Oft-times the sweetest music is made By the voices of the sad. The thinker oft is bent By a too-great load of thought; The discoverer's soul grows sick With the secret vainly sought: Lonely may be the home, No breath of fame may come, Yet through their lives doth shine A purple light Divine, And a nobler pain they prove Than the bloom of lower pleasures, or the fleeting spell of love. SEA VOICES. Peace, moaning Sea; what tale have you to tell? What mystic tidings, all unknown before? Whether you break in thunder on the shore, Or whisper like the voice within the shell, O moaning Sea, I know your burden well. 'Tis but the old dull tale, filled full of pain; The finger on the dial-plate of time, Advancing slow with pitiless beat sublime, As stoops the day upon the fading plain; And that has been which may not be again. The voice of yearning, deep but scarce expressed, For something which is not, but may be yet; Too full of sad continuance to forget, Too troubled with desires to be at rest, Too self-conflicting ever to be blest. The voice of hopes and aspirations high, Swallowed in sand, or shivered on the rock; Tumultuous life dashed down with sudden shock; And passionate protests, narrowed to a sigh, From hearts too weak to live,‚Äîtoo strong to die. The voice of old beliefs which long have fled, Gone with a shriek, and leaving naught behind, But some vague utterance, cold as wintry wind,‚Äî Some dim remembrance of a ghostly dread Which lingers still when faith itself is dead. And, above all, through thund'rous wintry roar, And summer ripple, this, and this alone, For ever do I make this barren moan:‚Äî No end, there is no end,‚Äîon Time's dull shore I wail, I beat, I thunder, evermore. BERLIN, 1871. The spring day was all of a flutter with flags; The mad chimes were beating like surf in the air; The beggars had slunk out of sight with their rags; And the balconies teemed with the rich and the fair. And below, on each side, the long vistas were set In a frame-work of faces, patient and white,‚Äî Wives, mothers, sweethearts, with full eyes wet, And sick hearts longing to see the sight. Till at length, when the evening was waning, there ran A stir through the crowd, and far-off, like a flame, The setting sun burned on the helms of the van, And with trampling of hoofs the proud conquerors came. And with every step they advanced, you might hear Women's voices, half-maddened with long-deferred joy: ‚ÄúThank God! he is safe. See, my love, we are here! See! here am I, darling; and this is our boy!‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúHere am I, dearest, still faithful and true; Your own love as of old!‚Äù Or an agonised cry, As the loved face came not with the comrades she knew And the rough soldiers found not a word to reply. And pitiful hands led her softly away, With a loving heart rent and broken in twain; And the triumph sweeps onward, in gallant array,‚Äî The life and the hope, the despair and the pain. Where was it? In Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Rome? Ages since, or to-day; in the old world, or new? Who shall tell? From all time these strange histories come; And to-day, as of old, the same story is true. And the long line sweeps past, and the dull world rolls on Though the rapture is dead and the sad tears are dry, And careless of all, till the progress be done, Life rides like a conqueror triumphing by. THE BEACON. Fair shines the beacon from its lonely rock, Stable alone amid the unstable waves: In vain the surge leaps with continual shock, In vain around the wintry tempest raves, And ocean thunders in her sounding caves. For here is life within the gate of death, Calm light and warmth amid the storm without; Here sleeping love breathes with untroubled breath, And faith, clear-eyed, pierces the clouds of doubt And monstrous depths which compass her about. So calm, so pure, yet prisoned and confined; Fenced by white walls from pleasure as from pain. Not always glooms the sea or shrieks the wind: Sometimes light zephyrs curl the azure main, And the sweet sea-nymphs glide with all their train. Or Aphrodite rises from the foam, And lies all rosy on the golden sand, And o'er the purple plains the Nereids roam; Sweet laughter comes, borne from the joyous band, And faint sweet odours from the far-off land. And straightway the impatient soul within Loathes its white house which to a jail doth turn; Careless of true or false, of right or sin, Careless of praying hands or eyes that burn, Or aught that sense can feel or mind discern. Knowing but this,‚Äîthat the unknown is blest, Holding delight of free untrammelled air: Delight of toil sweeter than any rest, Fierce storms with cores of calm for those who dare Black rayless nights than fairest noons more fair. And drifting forth at eve in some frail boat, Beholds the old light, like a setting star, Sink in the sea, and still doth fare and float Adown the night till day-break shows afar,‚Äî And hark the faint low thunders of the bar. Nor if indeed he reach the Bless√®d Isle, Nor if those pitiless crests shall plunge him down, Knows he; but whether breathless azure smile, Or furious night and horrible tempests frown, Living or dying, Freedom wears a crown. THE GARDEN OF REGRET. Beyond the dim walls of the shadowy Past, A sweet vague host of fancies flourishes, Like garden seeds in some rough hollow cast, Which all unasked the kind earth nourishes, And sends up tender blooms more sweet and fair Than the dull Present rears with all its care. There on its thin stem hangs the frail white flower; Far sweeter now she shines within the shade, Than when of old within the trim-kept bower And perfumed lush parterres her home she made; Because her sister blooms are past and gone, And this alone it is that lingers on. The same white flower,‚Äîbut oh, the depths of change! Before, the creamy petals, broad and strong, Were all adust with gold, and filled with strange Sweet scents, which lurked the odorous depths among; Deep in her honeyed wells, the bee would stay Content, and birds sing round the live-long day. The same white flower‚Äîyet changed in scent and hue. Now the fair feeble petals curl and shrink; The dead smooth surfaces are veined with blue; No honeyed draughts they hold for bee to drink, Nor busy hum, nor joyous song is heard. What hath she left to charm or bee or bird? Only a faint sweet odour lingers yet, Dearer than those rich scents of former years: A fragile fairness, fairer through regret, And watered by the dewy fount of tears. To me that outcast flower is dearer grown, Than when in those fair gardens overblown. I set her in the garden of my heart, And water her from life's sincerest spring; And lo! once more the frail stems quicken and start, Fair honeyed blooms arise and blithe birds sing: The old sweet flower in scent and gorgeous hue, But not the tender grace that once I knew. Alas! not in the Present will she grow: The Present has its own blooms sweet and bright; Within its four walls life's fair pleasures blow, And each gay season brings its own delight: Far off in dewy shades the exile sweet Grows fair, and paths untrodden by living feet. There let her stay. I know not if my theme Be love, or some fair child of heart or mind: Young friendships, hopes, beliefs, which like a dream Pass from us leaving some sweet ghost behind. Leave them behind, they have been; others are, And shall be. Lo! the spring time is not far. SECOND SERIES (1874). TO AN UNKNOWN POET. Henry Vaughan, the Silurist, died near Brecon, 1695. Dear friend, who, two long centuries ago, Didst tread where since my grandsires trod, Along thy devious Usk's untroubled flow, Breathing thy soul to God. I seek, I, born in these our later days, Using the measure thou didst love, With halting tribute of too tardy praise, A poet throned above. I in the self-same venerable halls And gray quadrangles made my home, Which heard, new-built, within their recent walls, Thy youthful footsteps come. A little grayer now and stiller grown, The tranquil refuge now, as then, Where our dear country glories in her own, Apart from alien men. There, on thy musings broke the painful sound Of arms; the long-plumed cavaliers Clanged thro' the courts‚Äîthe low fat fields around Were filled with strife and tears. Constrained by promptings of thy ancient race, Thy gown and books thou flungst away, To meet the sturdy Roundhead face to face On many a hard-fought day, Till thy soft soul grew sick, and thou didst turn To our old hills; and there, ere long, Love for thy Amoret, at times, would burn In some too fervid song. But soon thy wilder pulses stayed, and, life Grown equable, thy sweet muse mild, Sobered by tranquil love of child and wife, Flowed pure and undefiled. A humble healer thro' a life obscure, Thou didst expend thy homely days; Sweet Swan of Usk! few know how clear and pure Are thy unheeded lays. One poet shall become a household name Into the nation's heart ingrown; One more than equal miss the meed of fame, And live and die unknown. So thou, surviving in thy lonely age, All but thy own undying love Didst pour upon the sympathetic page, Words which all hearts can move; So quaintly fashioned as to add a grace To the sweet fancies which they bear, Even as a bronze delved from some ancient place For very rust shows fair. ‚ÄúThey all are gone into the world of light!‚Äù It is thy widowed muse that sings, And then mounts upwards from our dazzled sight On heavenward soaring wings. ‚ÄúHe that hath found some fledged bird's nest may know‚Äù ‚ÄúAt first sight if the bird be flown;‚Äù ‚ÄúBut what fair dell or grove he sings in now,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat is to him unknown.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd yet, as angels in some brighter dreams‚Äù ‚ÄúCall to the soul when man doth sleep,‚Äù ‚ÄúSo some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd into glory peep.‚Äù ‚ÄúO father of eternal life and all‚Äù ‚ÄúCreated glories under Thee!‚Äù ‚ÄúResume Thy Spirit from this world of thrall‚Äù ‚ÄúInto true liberty.‚Äù Thou hast rejoined thy dear ones now, and art, Dear soul, as then thou wouldst be, free. I, still a prisoner, strive to do my part In memory of thee. Thou art so high, and yet unknown: shall I Repine that I too am obscure? Nay, what care I, though all my verse shall die, If only it is pure? So some new singer of the days to be, Reading this page with soft young eyes, Shall note the tribute which I pay to thee With youth's sweet frank surprise. And musing in himself, perchance shall say, ‚ÄúTwo bards whom centuries part are here‚Äî One whose high fame and name defy decay, And one who held him dear.‚Äù COMFORT. Tho' love be bought and honour sold, The sunset keeps its glow of gold, And round the rosy summits cold The white clouds hover, fold on fold. Tho' over-ripe the nations rot, Tho' right be dead and faith forgot, Tho' one dull cloud the heavens may blot, The tender leaf delayeth not. Tho' all the world lie sunk in ill, The bounteous autumns mellow still, By virgin sand and sea-worn hill The constant waters ebb and fill. From out the throng and stress of lies, From out the painful noise of sighs, One voice of comfort seems to rise: ‚ÄúIt is the meaner part that dies.‚Äù SONG. [If ever, dear] If ever, dear, I might at last the barren victory gain, After long struggle and laborious pain, And many a secret tear, To think, since think I must of thee, Not otherwise than thou of me. Haply I might Thy chilling coldness, thy disdain, thy pride, Which draw me, half reluctant, to thy side, With a like meed requite, And I my too fond self despise, Seeing with disenchanted eyes. But now, alas! So fast a prisoner am I to my love, No power there is that can my chains remove, So sweet the caged hours pass, That, if it parted me from thee, I would not willingly grow free. Nor would I dare To ask for recompense of love again, Who love thee for the height of thy disdain. Thou wouldst not show so fair If we should own an equal flame, Unequal souls, in love the same. Full well I know That what I worship is not wholly thee, But a fair dream, a pious fantasy. Such as at times doth grow On yearnings of the cloistered mind, Or the rapt vision of the blind. Scorn me then, sweet, I would not thou shouldst leave thy lofty place, Thy lover should not see thee face to face, But prostrate at thy feet. No recompense, no equal part I seek, Only that thou be strong and I be weak. OH, SNOWS SO PURE! Oh, snows so pure! oh, peaks so high! I lift to you a hopeless eye. I see your icy ramparts drawn Between the sleepers and the dawn. I see you, when the sun has set, Flush with the dying daylight yet. I see you, passionless and pure, Above the lightnings stand secure; But may not climb, for now the hours Are spring's, and earth a maze of flowers. And now, 'mid summer's dust and heat, I stay my steps for childish feet. And now, when autumn glows, I fear To lose the harvest of the year. Now winter frowns, and life runs slow, Even on the plains I tread thro' snow. While ye are veiled, or, dimly seen, Only reveal what might have been; And where high hope would once aspire Broods a dark storm-cloud dealing fire. Oh, snows so pure! oh, peaks so high! I shall not reach you till I die! THE BEGINNINGS OF FAITH. All travail of high thought, All secrets vainly sought, All struggles for right, heroic, perpetually fought. Faint gleams of purer fire, Conquests of gross desire, Whereby the fettered soul ascends continually higher. Pure cares for love or friend Which ever upward tend, Too deep and heavenward and true to have on earth their end. Vile hearts malign and fell, Lives which no tongue may tell, So dark and dread and shameful that they breathe a present hell. White mountain, deep-set lake, Sea wastes which surge and break, Fierce storms which, roaring from the north, the midnight forests shake. Fair morns of summer days, Rich harvest eves that raise The soul and heart o'erburdened to an ecstasy of praise. Low whispers, vague and strange, Which through our being range, Breathing perpetual presage of some mighty coming change. These in the soul do breed Thoughts which, at last, shall lead To some clear, firm assurance of a satisfying creed. A MEMORY. Down dropped the sun upon the sea, The gradual darkness filled the land; Amid the twilight, silently, I felt the pressure of a hand. And a low voice: ‚ÄúHave courage, friend. Be of good cheer, 'tis not for long; He conquers who awaits the end, And dares to suffer and be strong.‚Äù I have seen many a land since then, Known many a joy and many a pain. Victor in many a strife of men, Vanquished again and yet again. The ancient sorrow now is not, Since time can heal the keenest smart; Yet the vague memory, scarce forgot, Lingers deep down within the heart. Still, when the ruddy flame of gold Fades into gray on sea and land, I hear the low sweet voice of old, I feel the pressure of a hand. THE NEW ORDER. The old lives are dead and gone and rotten, The old thoughts shall never more be thought, The old faiths have failed and are forgotten, The old strifes are done, the fight is fought. And with a clang and roll, the new creation Bursts forth 'mid tears and blood and tribulation. Sweet they were, the old days that are ended, The golden years, the happy careless hours Then, like Pagan gods on the asphodel extended, Dreaming, men wove them fancies fair as flowers. Love laid near them, Art to cheer them, youthful Beauty Sitting crowned upon the marble throne of Duty. All good things were theirs to cherish‚Äîlives grown finer From the heritage of long ancestral ease, And a nobler port, and temperate mien diviner Than their labours and their vigils leave to these; Gentler voices, smiles more gracious, and the fashion Of their soft lives tuned to pity and compassion. Naught men knew of science, now grown rigid With its teaching of inexpiable sin; Nor the dull pedantic gospel, dead and frigid, Of a heaven where mind alone may enter in, Doom awaiting, stern and silent, all transgression, And no saint with power to make an intercession. For a Ruler, as men thought they saw above them, More than earthly rulers, pitiful and mild, A Father with a stronger love to love them Than the love an earthly father bears his child‚Äî God above them, and for pleader and defender Christ's face stooping, like his mother's true and tender. But now there seems no place for the Creator To hold his long unbroken chain of law, Nor any need for heaven-sent Mediator, Nor the Providence our fathers thought they saw. Only a dull world-system, always tending To a blind goal, by a blind rule unbending. And for the courtesy and tender graces, The chivalries and charities of old, A dull and equal arrogance effaces Soft sympathies by hard demands and cold; And the giver giveth not, lest any blame him, And the taker may not take, lest taking shame him. Be still, oh ye of little faith, repining That the purpose of the Eternal will is dead. The silent stars forget not yet their shining, Daily the full sun journeys overhead. How shall mind's realm alone forget its reason, When the sure years roll season after season? There shall rise from this confus√®d sound of voices A firmer faith than that our fathers knew, A deep religion, which alone rejoices In worship of the Infinitely True, Not built on rite or portent, but a finer And purer reverence for a Lord diviner. There shall come from out this noise of strife and groaning A broader and a juster brotherhood, A deep equality of aim, postponing All selfish seeking to the general good. There shall come a time when each shall to another Be as Christ would have him‚Äîbrother unto brother. There shall come a time when knowledge wide extended, Sinks each man's pleasure in the general health, And all shall hold irrevocably blended The individual and the common-wealth, When man and woman in an equal union Shall merge, and marriage be a true communion. There shall come a time when brother-hood shows stronger Than the narrow bounds which now distract the world; When the cannons roar and trumpets blare no longer, And the ironclad rusts, and battle flags are furled; When the bars of creed and speech and race, which sever, Shall be fused in one humanity for ever. Oh, glorious end! oh, blessed consummation! Oh, precious day! for which we wait and yearn. Thou shalt come, and knit men nation unto nation. But not for us, who watch to day and burn, Thou shalt come, but after what long years of trial, Weary watchings, baffled longings, dull denial! AT MIDNIGHT. They were two poor young girls, little older than children, Who passed through the midnight streets of the city Singing. Poorly clad, morning-eyed, with a strange look of shyness, Linked arms, and round cheeks, and smooth heads bent together, Singing. Singing, great Heaven! with their fresh childish voices, Some low-murmured ditty, half hymntune, half love-song, Singing, Always by hushed square, and long street deserted, As from school by the old village street on fair evenings, Singing, Singing, and knowing it not, the old burden That is born out of secular wrongs and oppressions, Singing, Of selfish riches, of misery and hunger, Of sin that is bred of the wants of the wretched, Singing, Of poor bribes that purchase souls, of the endless, Perpetual harvest of pain and of evil, Singing, So, they passed to the flaring sin-befouled places, And amid the thick throng of the fallen I lost them, Singing, A hymn-tune, a love-song, a prayer chanted backward, A witch spell unholy, a sweet suffrage saintly Singing. NEMESIS. Who, without fear Piercing the inmost deeps of silent thought, Has won the prize with lonely labour sought, And many a bitter tear, He in his breast doth hold A rarer thing than gold, And a fair treasure greater than in words is told. For he shall learn, Not from another's lore, but his own soul, Whither life's hidden ocean currents roll, And with sure helm shall turn Into a haven fair, Where, on the breathless air, Nor wave nor storm shall break, but peace is everywhere. There, in light boat Laid on the soft breast of the summer sea, Lapt day by day in great tranquillity, He carelessly shall float. He scarce shall see or hear A sight or sound of fear, Only a low-voiced siren always gliding near. Without the bar The enormous surges leap from sea to sky. Upon the ghostly inland summits high The avalanche thunders far. On the dull plains below, In long successions slow The toiling generations sow, and reap, and sow. Dream-like, he sees The lurid smoke blot the beleaguered town, Or the great earthquake shake the city down; Labours and miseries; Fire takes them‚Äîfamine, flood, And fever's hideous brood. By night the black skies redden with a glare like blood. For him, meanwhile, Laid in the shelter of his silken sail, Tho' wind and storm on sea and land prevail, The enchanted waters smile. Always in that calm deep, Wherein life's currents sleep, He sees high heaven reflected, tho' all men may weep. Yet now and then Between the stars and him, sunk deep below, He starts to see a strange dead semblance grow, Gone from the eyes of men. Some thin and pale-eyed ghost, By marred reflections crost, Of thoughts, and faiths, and yearnings long since lost. And if these fade Betimes, he slowly gains to peace again; But if too long they tarry, such a pain Those clear depths doth invade, That for sheer terror he, And utter misery, Flies to the storm-wrapt hills and hungry calling sea. TO A CHILD OF FANCY. My little dove, my little lamb, In whom again a child I am; My innocent, on whose fair head The glories of the unknown are shed; Who thro' the laughing summer day Spendest the rosy hours in play, Too much by joyous life possest To give a willing thought to rest; Who, with the earliest shades of night, White-robed, in happy slumbers light, Recallest in thy stainless calm An angel resting from its psalm; Whence art thou come? What power could teach The secret of thy broken speech? What agile limb, what stalwart arm, Like thy sweet feebleness can charm? With what a rapture of surprise This fair world meets thy steadfast eyes, As if they saw reflected there Faint images of scenes more fair. Leaving another heaven behind, A heaven on earth thou cam'st to find; This world, so full of misery, Opens celestial gates for thee. Oh! if thou mightst not e'er grow wise With the sad learning born of sighs; If those soft eyes might never here Grow dim for any bitter tear. Vain thought,‚Äîno creature born of earth Blooms best 'neath cloudless skies of mirth; Only soft rains and clouds can dress Life's tree with flowers of blessedness. Whate'er the lot thy fate shall give, At least, while life is mine to live, Thou shalt not lack a share of love, My little lamb, my little dove! SONG. It was not that thy eyes Were blue as autumn skies, It was not that thy hair Was as an angel's fair. No excellence of form could move A finer soul to so much love. Nor that in thee I sought For precious gems of thought, Nor ever hoped to find Hid treasure in thy mind. Gray wisdom comes with time and age, And thine was an unwritten page. But that I seemed in thee My other self to see, Yet purer and more high Than meets my inner eye, Like that enamoured boy who, gazing down, His lower self would in his higher drown. THE ORGAN-BOY. Great brown eyes, Thick plumes of hair, Old corduroys The worse for wear; A buttoned jacket, And peeping out An ape's grave poll, Or a guinea pig's snout; A sun-kissed face, And a dimpled mouth, With the white flashing teeth And soft smile of the south; A young back bent, Not with age or care, But the load of poor music 'Tis fated to bear: But a commonplace picture To commonplace eyes, Yet full of a charm Which the thinker will prize. They were stern cold rulers, Those Romans of old, Scorning letters and art For conquest and gold; Yet leavening mankind, In mind and in tongue, With the laws that they made And the songs that they sung: Sitting rose-crowned, With pleasure-choked breath, As the nude young limbs crimsoned, Then stiffened in death; Piling up monuments Greater than praise, Thoughts and deeds that shall live To the latest of days: Adding province to province, And sea to sea, Till the idol fell down And the world rose up free. And this is the outcome, This vagabond child With that statue-like face And eyes soft and mild, This creature so humble, So gay, yet so meek, Whose sole strength is only The strength of the weak; Of those long cruel ages Of lust and of guile, Naught left us to-day But an innocent smile. For the laboured appeal Of the orator's art, A few childish accents That reach to the heart. For those stern legions speeding O'er sea and o'er land, But a pitiful glance And a suppliant hand. I could moralize still; But the organ begins, And the tired ape swings downward And capers and grins: And away flies romance. And yet, time after time, As I dream of days spent In a sunnier clime, Of blue lakes set deep In the olive-clad mountains, Of gleaming white palaces Girt with cool fountains, Of minsters where every Carved stone is a treasure, Of sweet music hovering 'Twixt pain and 'twixt pleasure; Of chambers enriched, On all sides, overhead, With the deathless creations Of hands that are dead; Of still cloisters holy, And twilight arcade, Where the lovers still saunter Thro' chequers of shade; Of tomb and of temple, Arena and column, 'Mid to-day's garish splendours, Sombre and solemn; Of the marvellous town With the salt-flowing street, Where colour is richest, And music most sweet; Of her the great mother, Who centuries sate 'Neath a black shadow blotting The days she was great; Bound so fast, brought so low‚Äî She, our source and our home‚Äî That only a phantom Was left us of Rome! She who, seeming to sleep Thro' all ages to be, Was the priests', is mankind's, Was a slave, and is free! I turn with grave thought To this child of the ages, And to all that is writ In Time's hidden pages. Shall young Howards or Guelphs, In the days that shall come, Wander forth seeking bread Far from England and home? Shall they sail to new continents, English no more, Or turn‚Äîstrange reverse‚Äî To the old classic shore? Shall fair locks and blue eyes, And the rose on the cheek, Find a language of pity The tongue cannot speak‚Äî ‚ÄúNot English, but angels‚Äù? Shall this tale be told Of Romans to be As of Romans of old? Shall they too have monkeys And music? Will any Try their luck with an engine Or toy spinning-jenny? Shall we too be led By that mirage of Art Which saps the true strength Of the national heart? The sensuous glamour, The dreamland of grace, Which rot the strong manhood They fail to replace; Which at once are the glory, The ruin, the shame, Of the beautiful lands And ripe souls whence they came? Oh, my Britain! oh, Mother Of Freemen! oh, sweet, Sad toiler majestic, With labour-worn feet! Brave worker, girt round, Inexpugnable, free, With tumultuous sound And salt spume of the sea, Fenced off from the clamour Of alien mankind By the surf on the rock, And the shriek of the wind, Tho' the hot Gaul shall envy, The cold German flout thee, Thy far children scorn thee, Still thou shalt be great! Still march on uncaring, Thy perils unsharing, Alone, and yet daring Thy infinite fate! Yet ever remembering The precepts of gold, That were written in part For the great ones of old‚Äî ‚ÄúLet other hands fashion The marvels of art; To thee fate has given A loftier part. To rule the wide peoples; To bind them to thee‚Äù By the sole bond of loving, That bindeth the free. To hold thy own place, Neither lawless nor slave; Not driven by the despot, Nor tricked by the knave! But these thoughts are too solemn, So play, my child, play, Never heeding the connoisseur Over the way, The last dances of course; Then, with scant pause between, ‚ÄúHome, Sweet Home,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOld Hundredth,‚Äù And ‚ÄúGod Save the Queen.‚Äù See the poor children swarm From dark court and dull street, As the gay music quickens The lightsome young feet. See them now whirl away, Now insidiously come, With a coy grace which conquers The squalor of home. See the pallid cheeks flushing With innocent pleasure At the hurry and haste Of the quick-footed measure. See the dull eyes now bright, And now happily dim, For some soft-dying cadence Of love-song or hymn. Dear souls, little joy Of their young lives have they, So thro' hymn-tune and song-tune Play on, my child, play. For tho' dull pedants chatter Of musical taste, Talk of hindered researches, And hours run to waste; Tho' they tell us of thoughts To ennoble mankind Which your poor measures chase From the labouring mind; While your music rejoices One joyless young heart, Perish bookworms and books, Perish learning and art‚Äî Of my vagabond fancies I'll e'en take my fill. ‚ÄúQualche cosa, signor?‚Äù Yes, my child, that I will. PROCESSIONS. To and fro, to and fro, The long, long processions go, Fainter now and now more bright, Now in shadow, now in light; Gay and sad, and gay again, Mixed of pleasure, mixed of pain. Bridal song and burial dirge, Rippling blue and leaden surge; Sunlit plain and storm-wrapt hill, Saintly lives or stained with ill; Youth and fire and frolic mirth, Cold age bending back to earth; Hope and faith and high endeavour, Dead lives slowly waning ever; Gleams of varying sun and shade, Buds that burst, and flowers that fade; Lives that spring, and lives that fall, And a Hidden Will o'er all. FOR LIFE. Shut in by self, as by a brazen wall, In a dry, windless court alone, Where no refreshing dews of eve may fall, Nor morning sun has shone. But ever broader, ever higher, higher, And ever yearly stronger grown, In long circuitous folds high towers aspire Around her central throne. And every year adds some fair outer-court, Green, lit with fountains, tended well, Some dainty pleasaunce fit for joy and sport, But not wherein to dwell. Or some high palace spired with fretted gold, And tricked with gems of thought and art; In blank perspective ranks its chambers cold, Too fair to touch the heart. For far within the inmost coil of towers, Wrapt round with shadows like a cloak, Where on the twilight hush of slow-paced hours Full utterance never broke; Neither of laughter nor the painful sound Of great thoughts come to sudden birth, Nor murmurs from the Sea that frets around The dull laborious earth; Nor voice of love or child, nor note of glee, Nor sigh, nor any weal nor woe‚Äî Naught but a chill, at times, as hopelessly The slow years come and go; She broods immured, a devil or a saint, Shut fast within a lonely cell, Peopled with beatific visions faint, Or ghostly shapes of hell. And every year she hears from some high gate That breaks the dizzy circuit of the wall, By hands invisible, but strong as fate, The loud portcullis fall. And every year upon her duller ear Faint and more faint the outward echoes come, Fainter the mingled tones of hope and fear, To this her cloistered home. Till, when the weary circuit's done and past, The last gate clangs, the tall towers sway and fall, A great voice calls with thunders, and at last The captive breaks her thrall! IN THE PARK. The stock-jobbers' madams dash In splendour thro' park and street. 'Tis a lightning of wheels that flash, 'Tis a thunder of high-stepping feet. Shrink aside, vile churl, for these princesses bold‚Äî These creatures of jewels and ermine and gold‚Äî As they loll by in insolent pride, Scarce deigning a glance of the eye, They scatter their mud stains far and wide On the humbler passer-by‚Äî Some rhymester it may be, whose bitter pen Shall pay them their mud stains with interest again. And, meanwhile, in some fetid street Their spouse and provider sits‚Äî A swindler fattening on lie and cheat, Sole fruit of his sordid wits‚Äî Full fed and bloated, or wan and pale, And haunted with fears of an imminent gaol. When my lady of high degree Rolls by with her lackeys ablaze, It gladdens my heart, good madams, to see The disdain of you in her gaze. I love her little, but, matched with you, I could fall on my knees to a pride so true. Or when Lais rattles by In her vesture of visible shame, Poor child, I whisper, and who am I To call her dead life by its name? Sad tawdry splendours that, one sure day, Will spread swift pinions and flutter away! But with you, vile spawn of deceit, What need to be chary of ire? Get down, I say, on your useless feet, And cleanse them with honest mire. Down with you, 'tis time, ere your eoaches be made The central block of a new barricade. Yet, perhaps, since in this poor life Things are double, each against each, Among you sometimes is the mother and wife With her darlings to cherish and teach, The gentle lady, tender and kind, With no shadow of evil on heart or mind. Ah, riddle of things! ah, great Perpetual struggle and war! The good which should be, in-separate, From the evil things that are‚Äî How shall I, with purblind vision, arraign The marvellous measures of joy and pain? Roll by then, brave dames, roll by; You are part of a scheme, I trow. No more will I look with a covetous eye On your splendours of pomp and show; For I see in your gorgeous chariots the strife, The problem, the wonder, the satire, of life. LOSS AND GAIN. From day to day, from year to year, New waves of change assail us here; Each day, each year, prolongs the chain Where pleasure alternates with pain. New earth-born exhalations rise, To hide the heavens from our eyes; New clouds obscure the vision fair, Which once was round us everywhere. New precious obligations come, New sanctities of love and home, New tender hopes, new anxious fears, And sweet experiences of tears. Old tastes are lost, old thoughts grow strange, Old longings gradually change, Old faiths seem no more dear or true, Lost in the full light of the new. Youth's boundless aspirations fled, And every wild ambition dead; Love not a meteor blinding sight, But a pure ray of sober light. And for the passionate self of old, A deep affection, calm, not cold; A pitying love serenely kind, A broader trust, a juster mind, A faith which occupies the heart, Tho' the brain halts to bear its part, Which threat and promise fail to move, Like the dim consciousness of love. Tho' much be taken, much is left, Not all forsaken nor bereft; From change on change we come to rest, And the last moment is the best. SONG. ‚ÄúOnly a woman's hair,‚Äù A fair lock severed and dead; But where is the maiden‚Äîwhere That delicate head? Perhaps she is rich and fair, Perhaps she is poor and worn, And 'twere better that one somewhere Had never been born. And the careless hand that threw That faded tress away‚Äî Ah! the false heart that once seemed true, Ah! love flung away. THE APOLOGY. I may not scorn, I cannot prize Those whose quick-coming fancies rise Only in quaint disguise‚Äî Some trick of speech, or mien, or dress, Some obsolete uncomeliness, Some ancient wickedness. Strange words antique for things not strange, Like broken tower and mould'ring grange, Made fair through time and change. Legends of knight, and squire, and dame, With this our common life the same In glory and in shame. Mean lives and narrow aims which owe The glamour and the charm they show To that strange ‚ÄúLong ago;‚Äù Nay, meaner, lower than our own, Because To-day is wider grown, Knows deeper, and is known. I doubt if anything there be Which best thro' mask of chivalry, Reveals myself to me; Myself, its yearnings and desires, Its glimpses of supernal fires, The something which aspires; Myself, the thing of blot and stain, Which fallen, rises, falls again, A mystery of pain; Myself, the toiler slow to earn, The thinker sowing words that burn, The sensuous in turn, The vanquished, the disgraced, the saint, Now free as air, now bound and faint, By everyday constraint. Or, if too near the present lies For common brains and common eyes To probe its mysteries. If feeble fancy fails to tear The outer husk of fact, and bare The seed to vital air, But too extended, too immense, Life's orb a vast circumference Stretches for mortal sense; If simpler shows the past, more fair, Set in a pure and luminous air, Not dimmed by mists of care, Seeming to breathe a lighter strain Of lutes and lyres where none complain With undertones of pain;‚Äî If haply there we seem to view Ourselves, behind a veil, yet true The germ from which we grew; Not less our duty and our pride Forbid to leave unsought, untried, The glories at our side. What? shall the limner only paint Blue hills with adumbrations faint, Or misty aureoled saint, And scorn to ponder flower or tree, Ripe fields, child-faces, summer sea, And all fair things that be; Nor care thro' passion's endless play, Our living brethren to portray, Who fare to doom to-day, When the sun's finger deigns to trace Each line and feature of man's face, Its beauty and disgrace? Or shall the skilled musician dare Only to sound some jocund air Arcadian, free from care, Round whom in strains that scorn control The mighty diapasons roll, That speak from soul to soul; Our mystical modern music deep, Not piped by shepherds to their sheep, But wrung from souls that weep; Where seldom melody is heard, Nor simple woodland note of bird, So deep a depth is stirred, Such blended harmonies divine Across the core of sweetness twine As round the grape the vine? Or shall some false cold dream of art Corrupt the voice and chill the heart, And turn us from our part, Blot out the precious lesson won From all the ages past and done, That bard and seer are one? Dull creed of earthy souls! who tell That, be the song of heaven or hell, Who truly sings, sings well, And with the same encomiums greet The satyr baring brutish feet, And pure child-angels sweet; Whose praise in equal meed can share The M√¶nad with distempered hair, The cold Madonna fair. Great singers of the past! whose song Still streams down earthward pure and strong, Free from all stain of wrong. Whose lives were chequered, but whose verse The generations still rehearse; Yet never soul grew worse. What is it that these would? shall I, Born late in time, consent to lie In the old misery? I‚Äîwho have learnt that flesh is dust, What gulfs dissever love from lust, The wrongful from the just‚Äî Put on again the rags of sense, A Pagan without innocence, A Christian in offence? Perish the thought! I am to-day What God and Time have made me; they Have ordered, I obey. And day by day the labouring earth Whirls on‚Äîglad mysteries of birth, Sad death throes, sorrow, mirth, Youth's flower just bursting into bloom, Wan age, a sun which sets in gloom, The cradle, and the tomb; These are around me‚Äîhope and fear, Not fables, but alive and near, Fresh smile and scarce-dried tear; These are around me, these I sing, These, these of every thought and thing, My verse shall heavenward wing. The sun but seems to kiss the hill, And all the vast eternal Will Is moving, working, still God is, Truth lives, and overhead Behold a visible glory spread; Only the past is dead. Courage! arise; if hard it seem To sing the present, yet we deem 'Tis worthier than a dream. Awake, arise, for to the bold The seeming desert comes to hold Blossoms of white and gold. Shall I then choose to take my side With those who love their thoughts to hide In vague abstractions wide? Whose dim verse struggles to recall The hopes, the fears that rise and fall Deep in the souls of all. Who fitly choose a fitting theme. Not things which neither are nor seem, No visionary dream, But the great psalm of life, the long Harmonious confluence of song, Thro' all the ages strong, But grown to wider scale to-day, And sweeping fuller chords than they Knew who have passed away. A worthy theme for worthy bard But all too often blurred and marred By intonations hard. So that the common eye and ear Can dimly see and faintly hear What should be bright and clear. Who wing the fiery thought so high, An arrow shot into the sky, Its failing forces die, And all the straining eye discerns Is but a spark which feebly burns, Then quenched to earth returns. Or with a borrowed lyre devote Hoarse accent and untuneful throat To sound a difficult note, By currents of conflicting thought, And counter themes which rise unsought, And jangling chords distraught. Not song, but science, sign not sound, Not soaring to high heaven, but bound Fast to the common ground. Who with a pitiless skill dissect What secret sources, vexed and checked, Surge upward in effect, And trace in endless struggling rhyme How hearts forlorn of love and time Have rotted into crime. Or those who, baffled and opprest By life's incessant fierce unrest, Where naught that is seems best, Assail the tyrant, lash the wrong, Till but a wild invective long, Is left in lieu of song. Most precious all, yet this is sure, The song which longest shall endure Is simple, sweet, and pure. Not psychologic riddles fine, Not keen analysis, combine In verse we feel divine. Nor fierce o'erbalanced rage alone, Which mars the rhyme, and dulls the tone‚Äî They may not sing who groan; But a sweet cadence, wanting much Of depth, perhaps, and fire, but such As finer souls can touch, To finer issues; such as come To him who far afield must roam, Thinking old thoughts of home. Or who in Sabbath twilights hears His children lisp a hymn, and fears Lest they should see his tears. Wherefore, my soul, if song be thine, If any gleam of things divine Thro' thee may dimly shine, If ever any faintest note Of far-off sweetness swell thy throat, True echo tho' remote, This is my task, to sing To-day, Not dead years past and fled away, But this alone‚ÄîTo-day. Or if I pause a little space Striving, across the gulf, to trace Some fine, forgotten face‚Äî Some monarch of the race whose name Still lives upon the lips of fame, Touched by no stain of shame; Some sweet old love-tale, ever young, Which of old time the burning tongue Of god-like bard has sung; Some meed of effort nobly won, Some more than human task begun, Precious though left undone; Some awful story, strong to show How passions unrestricted flow Into a sea of woe; Not less my powers I strive to bend, Not less my song aspires to tend To one unchanging end, By lofty aspirations, stirred Thro' homely music, daily heard, Trite phrase and common word, Simple, but holding at the core Thoughts which strange speech and varied lore Have hid from men before. To lift how little howsoe'er The hearts of toilers struggling here, In joyless lives and sere. To make a little lighter yet Their lives by daily ills beset, Whom men and laws forget. To sing, if sing I must, of love As a pure spell, with power to move Dull hearts to things above. But choosing rather to portray The warring tides of thought which stray Thro' doubting souls to-day. Or if at times, with straining eye And voice, I dwell on things which lie Hidden in Futurity, And strive to tell in halting rhyme The glorious dawn, the golden prime, The victories of Time, The race transfigured, wrong redressed, None worn with labour, nor oppressed, But peace for all and rest, And knowledge throwing wide the shrine From whose broad doorways seems to shine An effluence Divine;‚Äî If of these visions fain to dream, Not less I hold, whate'er may seem, The Present for my theme, The vain regret remembering, Which lost occasion knows to bring,‚Äî Afraid, yet bound, to sing. SONG. [Ah! love is like a tender flower] Ah! love is like a tender flower Hid in the opening leaves of life, Which, when the springtide calls, has power To scorn the elemental strife‚Äî So strong, that well it knows to gain Fresh sweetness from the wind and rain. So strong, and yet so weak, alas! It waits the wooing of the sun; 'Mid frosts and snows the brief hours pass, And when they melt the spring is done. Gay blooms and honeyed fruits may come, But spring is dead, and birds are dumb. AS IN A PICTURE. White, on a cliff they stood; Beyond, a cypress wood. Three there were‚Äîone who wept, And one as though he slept; One with wide steadfast eyes Fixed in a sad surprise. Day, like a dying hymn, Grew gradually dim. A solitary star Gleamed on them from afar. Beneath, by sand and cave Sobbed the continual wave. Long time in reverent thought Who these might be I sought, Then suddenly I said, ‚ÄúOh, Lord of quick and dead!‚Äù AT AN ALMSHOUSE. Beneath these shadows holy Age rests, or paces slowly, And muses, muses always On that which once has been, Recalling years long ended, And vanished visions splendid; The throb, the flush of old days, When all the world was green. When every hour brought pleasure, And every flower a treasure, And whispered words were spoken, And love was everywhere. The swift brief hour of passion, And then the old, old fashion, The childish accents broken‚Äî Oh, precious days and fair! The years of self-denial, Blissful tho' full of trial, The young blooms waxing stronger, The older come to fruit. The tranquil days of gladness, The gradual calm and sadness, When childhood cheers no longer, And all the house is mute. Gone, but not wholly taken; Left, yet not all forsaken. Again the worn hearts cherish The memories of home; Again love-whispers greet them, Their children run to meet them, Blest dreams which never perish Until the end be come. A YORKSHIRE RIVER. The silent surfaces sleep With a sullen viscous flow, And scarce in the squalid deep Swing the dead weeds to and fro, And no living thing is there to swim or creep In the sunless gulfs below. And beneath are the ooze and the slime, Where the corpse lies as it fell, The hidden secrets of crime Which no living tongue shall tell, The shameful story of time, The old, old burden of hell. All the grasses upon the bank Are bitter with scurf and drift, And the reeds are withered and dank; And sometimes, when the smoke clouds shift, You may see the tall shafts in a hideous rank Their sulphurous fumes uplift. From the black blot up the stream The funeral barges glide, And the waves part as in a dream, From broad bow and sunken side; And 'tis ‚Äúgreed, greed!‚Äù hisses from coal and from steam, Foul freightage and turbid tide, Like the life of a slumb'ring soul Grown dull in content and health, Whose dark depths lazily roll, Whose still currents creep by stealth. Nor sorrow nor yearning comes to control The monotonous tide of wealth. Fair or foul, in life as in death, One blight and corruption o'er all, Blow on them, great wind, with thy breath, Fall, blinding water-floods, fall, Till the dead life below awakeneth, And deep unto deep doth call! FOR JUDGMENT. The form was young, the face was fair, Her hands seemed still together tied, 'Twas as if Eve was standing there, With the stern guardian at her side. I mused on all the depths of will, Of judgment, knowledge, right, and wrong. The pleadings crept their course, and still I sat in musings sad and long. But when they ceased the tale of shame, And the cold voice pronounced her name, But one thought held me, that was all, 'Twas thus we did my sister call. ODE ON A FAIR SPRING MORNING. Come, friend, let us forget The turmoil of the world a little while, For now the soft skies smile, With dew the flowers are wet. Let us away awhile With fierce unrest and carking thoughts of care, And breathe a little while the jocund air, And sing the joyous measures sung By blither singers, when the world was young. For still the world is young, for still the spring Renews itself, and still the lengthening hours Bring back the month of flowers; The leaves are green to-day as those of old, For Chaucer and for Shakspeare; still the gold Of August gilds the rippling waves of wheat; Young maids are fair and sweet As when they frolicked gay, with flashing feet, Round the old May-pole. All young things rejoice. No sorrow dulls the blackbird's mellow voice, Thro' the clear summer dawns or twilights long. With aspect not more dim Thro' space the planets swim Than of old time o'er the Chaldean plain. We only, we alone, Let jarring discords mar our song. And find our music take a lower tone. We only with dim eyes And laboured vision feebly strain, And flout the undying splendours of the skies. Oh, see how glorious show, On this fair morn in May, the clear-cut hills, The dewy lawns, the hawthorn's white, Argent on fields of gold; the growing light Pure as when first on the young earth The faint warm sunlight came to birth; There is a nameless air Of sweet renewal over all which fills The earth and sky with life, and every-where Before the new-born sun begins to glow, The birds awake which slumbered all night long, And with a gush of song, First doubting of their strain, then full and wide Raise their fresh hymns thro' all the country side; Already, above the dewy clover, The soaring lark begins to hover Over his mate's low nest; And soon, from childhood's early rest In hall and cottage, to the casement rise The little ones with their fresh opened eyes, And gaze on the old Earth, which still grows new, And see the tranquil heaven's unclouded blue, And, since as yet no sight nor sound of toil The fair spread, peaceful picture comes to soil, Look with their young and steadfast gaze Fixed in such artless sweet amaze As Adam knew, when first on either hand He saw the virgin landscapes of the morning land. Oh, youth, dawn, springtide, triune miracle, Renewing life in earth, and sky, and man, By what eternal plan Dost thou revive again and yet again? There is no morn that breaks, No bud that bursts, no life that comes to birth, But the rapt fancy takes, Far from the duller plains of mind and earth, Up to the source and origin of things, Where, poised on brooding wings, It seems to hover o'er the immense inane, And see the suns, like feeble rings of light, Orb from the gray, and all the youngling globe A coil of vapour circling like a dream, Then fixed compact for ever; the first beam Strike on the dark and undivided sea, And wake the deeps with life. Oh, mystery That still dost baffle thought, Though by all sages sought, And yet art daily done With each returning sun, With every dawn which reddens in the skies, With every opening of awakened eyes! How shall any dare to hold That the fair world growing old, Hath spent in vanished time The glories of its prime? Beautiful were the days indeed Of the Pagan's simple creed, When all of life was made for girl and boy, And all religion was but to enjoy. The fair chivalric dream To some may glorious seem, When from the sleeping centuries, Awakened Europe seemed to rise; It may be that we cannot know, In these ripe years, the glory and the glow Of those young hours of time, and careless days, Borne down too much by knowledge, and opprest, To halt a little for the needed rest, And yield ourselves awhile to joy and praise; Yet every year doth bring With each recurrence of the genial hour The infancy of spring, Crowned with unfolding leaf and bursting flower, And still to every home Fresh childish voices come, And eyes that opened last in Paradise, And with each rosy dawn Are night and death withdrawn; Another world rises for other eyes; Again begins the joy, the stress, the strife, Ancient as time itself, and wide as life. We are the ancients of the world indeed; No more the simple creed, When every hill and stream and grove Was filled with shy divinities of love, Allures us, serving as our King A Lord of grief and suffering. Too much our wisdom burdens to permit The fair, thin visions of the past, to flit From shade to shade, or float from hill to hill. We are so compassed round by ill, That all the music of our lives is dumb, Amid the turbulent waves of sound that rise, The discord born of doubts, and tears, and sighs, Which daily to the listening ear do come; Nay, oft, confounded by the incessant noise Of vast world-engines, grinding law on law, We lose the godhead that our fathers saw, And all our higher joys, And bear to plod on daily, deaf and blind, To a dark goal we dare not hope to find. But grows the world then old? Nay, all things that are born of time Spring upwards, and expand from youth to prime, Ripen from flower to fruit, From song-tide till the days are mute, Green blade to ear of gold. But not the less through the eternal round The sleep of winter wakes in days of spring, And not the less the bare and frozen ground Grows blithe with blooms that burst and birds that sing. Nature is deathless; herb and tree, Through time that has been and shall be, Change not, although the outward form Seem now the columned palm Nourished in zones of calm, And now the gnarled oak that defies the storm. The cedar's thousand summers are no more To her than are the fleeting petals gay Which the young spring, ere March is o'er, Scarce offered, takes away. Eternal are her works. Unchanging she, Alike in short-lived flower and ever-changing sea. We, too, are deathless; we, Eternal as the Earth, We cannot cease to be While springtide comes or birth. If our being cease to hold Reflected lights divine On budding lives, with every morn they shine With unabated gold. Though lost it may be to our mortal sight, It cannot be that any perish quite‚Äî Only the baser part forgets to be. And if within the hidden Treasury Of the great Ruler we awhile should rest, To issue with a higher stamp imprest, With all our baser alloy purged and spent, Were we not thus content? Our thoughts too mighty are To be within our span of years confined, Too deep and wide and far, The hopes, the fears, that crowd the labouring mind, The sorrows that oppress, The sanctities that bless, Are vaster than this petty stage of things. The soaring fancy mounts on careless wings Beyond the glimmer of the furthest star. The nightly watcher who with patient eye Scans the illumined sky, Knows when the outward rushing fire shall turn, And in far ages hence shall brightly burn For eyes to-day undreamt of. The clear voice From Greece or Israel thro' the centuries heard Still bids us tremble or rejoice, Stronger than living look or word; The love of home or race, Which doth transfigure us, and seems to bring On every heaven-lit face Some shadow of the glory of our King, Fades not on earth, nor with our years doth end; Nay, even earth's poor physical powers transcend The narrow bounds of space and time, The swift thought by some mystic sympathy Speeding through desert sand, and storm-tost sea. And shall we hold the range of mind Is to our little lives confined; That the pure heart in some blest sphere above, Loves not which here was set on fire of love; The clear eye scans not still, which here could scan The confines of the Universal plan; The seer nor speaks nor thinks his thoughts sublime, And all of Homer is a speck of lime? Nay, friend, let us forget Our haunting doubts and fears a little while, Again our springs shall smile; We shall not perish yet. If God so guide our fate, The nobler portions of ourselves shall last Till all the lower rounds of life be past, And we, regenerate. We too again shall rise, The same and not the same, As daily rise upon the orient skies New dawns with wheels of flame. So, if it worthy prove, Our being, self-perfected, shall upward move To higher essence, and still higher grown, Not sweeping idle harps before a throne, Nor spending praise where is no need of praise, But through unnumbered lives and ages come From pure laborious days, To an eternal home, Where spring is not, nor birth, nor any dawn, But life's full noontide never is with-drawn. LOVE TRIUMPHANT. Love took me up, a naked, helpless child, Love laid me sleeping on the tender breast, Love gazed on me with saintly eyes and mild, Love watched me as I lay in happy rest, Love was my childhood's stay, my chiefest good, My daily friend, my solace, and my food. But when to Love's own stature I was come, Treading the paths where fabled Loves abound, Hard by the Cytherean's magic home, Loveless I paced alone the enchanted ground. Some phantoms pale I marked, which fled away, And lo, my youth was gone; my hair turned gray. Loveless I lived long time, until I knew A thrill since childish hours unknown before, My cloistered heart forth to the wicket flew, And Love himself was waiting at the door. And now, howe'er the treacherous seasons move, Love dwells with me again, and I with Love. Love folds me round, Love walks with me, Love takes My heart and burns it with a holy fire: Love lays me on his silver wings, and makes My fainting soul to thinner air aspire. Love of the Source, the Race, the True, the Right, This is my sole companion day and night. TOLERANCE. Call no faith false which e'er has brought Relief to any laden life, Cessation from the pain of thought, Refreshment 'mid the dust of strife. What though the thing to which they kneel Be dumb and dead as wood or stone, Though all the rapture which they feel Be for the worshipper alone? They worship, they adore, they bow Before the Ineffable Source, before The hidden soul of Good; and thou, With all thy wit, what dost thou more? Kneel with them, only if there come Some zealot or sleek knave who strives To mar the sanctities of home, To tear asunder wedded lives; Or who by subtle wile has sought, By shameful promise, shameful threat. To turn the thinker from his thought, To efface the eternal landmarks set, 'Twixt faith and knowledge; hold not peace For such, but like a sudden flame Let loose thy scorn on him, nor cease Till thou hast covered him with shame. A HYMN IN TIME OF IDOLS. Though they may crowd Rite upon rite, and mystic song on song; Though the deep organ loud Through the long nave reverberate full and strong; Though the weird priest, Whom rolling clouds of incense half conceal, By gilded robes increased, Mutter and sign, and proudly prostrate kneel; Not pomp, nor song, nor bended knee Shall bring them any nearer Thee. I would not hold Therefore that those who worship still where they, In dear dead days of old, Their distant sires, knelt once and passed away, May not from carven stone, High arching nave and reeded column fine, And the thin soaring tone Of the keen music catch a breath divine, Or that the immemorial sense Of worship adds not reverence. But by some bare Hill-side or plain, or crowded city street, Wherever purer spirits are, Or hearts with love inflamed together meet, Rude bench and naked wall, Humble and sordid to the world-dimmed sight, On these shall come to fall A golden ray of consecrating light, And Thou within the midst shalt there Invisible receive the prayer. In every home, Wherever there are loving hearts and mild, Thou still dost deign to come, Clothed with the likeness of a little child; Upon the hearth Thou still Dwellest with them at meat, or work, or play; Thou who all space dost fill Art with the pure and humble day by day; Thou treasurest the tears they weep, And watchest o'er them while they sleep. Spirit and Word! That still art hid in every faithful heart, Indwelling Thought and Lord‚Äî How should they doubt who know Thee as Thou art? How think to bring Thee near By magic words, or signs, or any spell, Who art among us here, Who always in the loving soul dost dwell, Who art the staff and stay indeed Of the weak knees and hands that bleed? Then let them take Their pagan trappings, and their lifeless lore; Let us arise and make A worthy temple where was none before. Each soul its own best shrine, Its priesthood, its sufficient sacrifice, Its cleansing fount divine, Its hidden store of precious sanctities. Those only fit for priestcraft are From whom their Lord and King is far. ON A MODERN PAINTED WINDOW. Time was they lifted thee so high Between the gazer and the sky, That all the worshipper might see Was God no more, but only thee. So high was set thy cross, that they Who would thy every thought obey, Saw not thy gracious face, nor heard More than an echo of thy word. But now 'tis nearer to the ground, The weeping women kneel around, The scoffers sneering by, deride Thy kingly claims, thy wounded side. Only two beams of common wood, And a meek victim bathed in blood, Rude nails that pierce the tortured limb, Mild eyes with agony grown dim. Aye, but to those who know thee right Faith strengthens with the nearer sight; Love builds a deeper, stronger, creed On those soft eyes and hands that bleed. Raised but a little from the rest, But higher therefore and more blest; No more an empty priestly sign, But the more human, more divine. A MIDSUMMER NIGHT. The long day wanes, the broad fields fade; the night, The sweet June night, is like a curtain drawn; The dark lanes know no faintest sound, and white The pallid hawthorn lights the smooth-pleached lawn; The scented earth drinks from the silent skies Soft dews, more sweet than softest harmonies. There is no stir nor breath of air, the plains Lie slumbering in the close embrace of night, Only the rustling landrail's note complains; The children's casement shows the half-veiled light, Only beneath the solemn elm trees tall The fountain seems to fall and cease to fall. No change will come, nor any sound be made Thro' the still hours which shall precede the day; Only the bright-eyed stars will slowly fade, And a thin vapour rise up cold and gray, Then a soft breeze will whisper fresh and cold, And up the swift sun hurries red as gold. And then another dawn, another link, To bind the coming to the vanished day, Another foot-pace nearer to the brink Whereon our perilous footsteps hardly stay, Another line upon the secular page Of birth-throes, bridals, sick-beds, youth and age. Sweet summer night, than summer days more fair, Safe haven of the weary and forlorn, Splendid the gifts the luminous noontides bear, Lovely the opening eyelids of the morn; But thou with softest touch transfigurest This toilworn earth into a heaven of rest. GOOD IN EVERYTHING. The white shafts of the dawn dispel The night clouds banked across the sky; The sluggish vapours curl and die, And the day rises. It is well. Unfold, ye tender blooms of life; Sing, birds; let all the world be gay: 'Tis well,‚Äîthe morning of our day Must rise 'mid joyous songs and strife. Beat, noonday sun, till all the plain Swoons, and life seems asleep or dead: 'Tis well,‚Äîthe harvest of our bread Is sown in sorrow and reaped in pain. Close, evening shadows, soft and deep, When life reviving breathes once more; Fall, silent night, when toil is o'er, And the soul folds her wings in sleep. Come joy or grief, come right or wrong, In good or evil, life or death; We are the creatures of His breath: Nor shall His hand forsake us long. THE REPLY. If I were to answer you As you would, my soul would soar Like the lark from earth-born eyes, Soar and hide in far-off skies, Soar and come to mortal view Nevermore. Whatsoever chance befall, Of myself I'd die possest. If they hold a willing mind Silken threads like steel can bind. Only to be free is blest‚Äî Free is all. Press me not, of earth am I; Paths there are I dare not tread. Sweet are fields and flowers, the smile Of girlhood; but a little while Blossoms youth, and overhead Laughs the sky. What have we to do with love,‚Äî We for whom the seasons bring Nothing else than golden hours, Sun that burns, nor cloud that lowers, Thro' whose veins the tides of spring Lightly move? But if any pain should come To o'ercloud your summer, dear, Pain another's heart may share, Come and we our fate will dare,‚Äî Come, forgetting doubt and fear, To your home. THE TOUCHSTONE. Said one, ‚Äú'Tis Use must lend The clue our thoughts to bend To the true end.‚Äù Then I. ‚ÄúBut can your thought Reach thus for ages sought, The eternal ‚ÄòOught?‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúWould not the martyr spurn The truth you teach, to learn, Rot, rather,‚Äîburn?‚Äù ‚ÄúWere not death's self more sweet Than to live incomplete A life effete?‚Äù Then he. ‚ÄúBut who shall hold They grasped not over bold Their faith of old,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoarding a random creed For which they bore to bleed, Not proved indeed?‚Äù ‚ÄúFor who the truth shall seize Grasps it by slow degrees, Not snatched, as these.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd who would save his kind Must spend, the clue to find, Not heart, but mind.‚Äù Then I. ‚ÄúBut mind alone, Is dead as wood or stone, Stirs naught and none.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd who with prying eyes Will motive analyze, For him it dies.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd all his hours remain A barren, endless plain, Not joy nor pain:‚Äù ‚ÄúA tideless, windless sea, A blank eternity, Still doomed to be.‚Äù Then he. ‚ÄúThe Use we teach All forms of being can reach, Saves all by each.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo hasty glance or blind, To passing goods confined, Changeful as wind;‚Äù ‚ÄúBut with a steadfast view, Piercing the boundless blue Up to the True.‚Äù ‚ÄúContented to efface Self, if from out its place Blossoms the race;‚Äù ‚ÄúIf from lives crushed and wrecked, A perfected effect, Man stands erect.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo whom all pleasures show An aspect mean and low Beside to know.‚Äù ‚ÄúHolding all other thought Than which for this is sought A thing of naught.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis seeking, nothing less, What broader happiness Most lives may bless?‚Äù Then I. ‚ÄúIf the desire To which your thoughts aspire Blazed forth afire;‚Äù ‚ÄúIf all the task were done, All stubborn contests won Beneath the sun;‚Äù ‚ÄúIf hope came not to cheer, Nor bracing chill of fear, Sweet sigh nor tear;‚Äù ‚ÄúBut all the race should sleep In a broad calm, too deep For one to weep.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd o'er all lands should reign A dull content inane, Worse far than pain;‚Äù ‚ÄúIf, all its griefs forgot, Slowly the race should rot, Fade and be not;‚Äù ‚ÄúWould not the thought oppress The dream that once could bless, With such distress,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat, from the too great strain, Life withered, heart and brain, Would rise in vain?‚Äù Then he. ‚ÄúThe outcome this Of all philosophies, ‚ÄòWho seeks shall miss.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúWho toil aright, for those Life's pathway, ere it close, Is as the rose.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe spires of wisdom stand, Piled by the unconscious hand, From grains of sand.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd pleasure comes unsought, To those who take but thought For that, they ought;‚Äù ‚ÄúA bloom, a perfume rare, A deep-hid jewel fair For those who dare.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo who the race aright Loveth, a clearer sight Shall yet requite;‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd, since he seeks it less, An unsought happiness His toil shall bless.‚Äù Then I. ‚Äú'Twere strange indeed Should not our longing need A clearer creed.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf only this were blest, To ponder well how best To serve the rest.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince grows; 'tis understood, The happy multitude, From each man's good,‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom general sacrifice, How should for each arise, Content for sighs?‚Äù ‚ÄúOr shall we deem it true That who the road pursue To gain the True,‚Äù ‚ÄúMay not the summit gain By paths direct and plain To heart and brain,‚Äù ‚ÄúBut with averted mind, And sedulously blind, The end must find?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs truth a masker, then, Rejoiced to mock the ken Of toiling men?‚Äù ‚ÄúNow tricked as Use, now Right, But always in despite Of our poor sight.‚Äù ‚ÄúDoth it not rather seem We live, whate'er we deem, As in a dream,‚Äù ‚ÄúActing, but acting still The dictates to fulfil Of a sure Will,‚Äù ‚ÄúSeeing in Use and Right, Twin rays indefinite Of a great Light,‚Äù ‚ÄúA mystic Sun and clear, Which through mind's atmosphere Can scarce appear,‚Äù ‚ÄúBut which not less we know; In all fair flowers that grow, Loud storms that blow,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn noble thought and word, In aspirations heard, When hearts are stirred,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn every breathing breath, Life that awakeneth, Life that is death,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhether serene it shine Or clouds our view confine, Wondrous, Divine?‚Äù Then he. ‚ÄúShall this excuse Him who a dream should choose Rather than Use,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat he prefer to hold Some dark abstraction old, Remote and cold,‚Äù ‚ÄúSome thin ghost, fancy-dressed, Whereby men's souls oppressed, Forfeit the best,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd for a dream neglect What splendours of effect Their lives had decked?‚Äù Then I. ‚ÄúThough mind and brain Wither and are in vain, And thought a pain;‚Äù ‚ÄúThough sorrow, like a thief, Follow to rob belief, And faith be grief;‚Äù ‚ÄúThough my obedience show No fruit I here may know Save utter woe;‚Äù ‚ÄúThough health and strength decay; Yea, though the Truth shall slay, I will obey.‚Äù NOTHING LOST. Where are last year's snows, Where the summer's rose,‚Äî Who is there that knows? Or the glorious note Of some singer's throat, Heard in years remote? Or the love they bore Who, in days of yore, Loved, but are no more? Or the faiths men knew When, before mind grew, All strange things seemed true? The snows are sweet spring rain, The dead rose blooms again, Young voices keep the strain. The old affection mild Still springs up undefiled For love, and friend, and child. The old faiths grown more wide, Purer and glorified, Are still our lifelong guide. Nothing that once has been, Tho' ages roll between And it be no more seen, Can perish, for the Will Which doth our being fulfil, Sustains and keeps it still. THE HIDDEN SELF. I know not if a keener smart Can come to finer souls than his Who hears men praise him, mind or heart, For something higher than he is. Who fain would say, ‚ÄúBehold me, friends, That which I am, not what you deem, A thing of low and narrow ends, Sordid, not golden as I seem. See here the hidden blot of shame, The weak thought that you take for strong, The brain too dull to merit fame, The faint and imitative song.‚Äù But dares not, lest discovery foul Not his name only, but degrade Heights closed but to the soaring soul, Names which scorn trembles to invade; And doth his inner self conceal From all men in his own despite, Hiding what he would fain reveal, And a most innocent hypocrite. MARCHING. Once, and once again, From the thick crowd of men, Loud toil and high endeavour, There comes a secret sound, Where the thinkers stand around, And sometimes 'tis ‚ÄúFor ever,‚Äù Sometimes ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù Always that ceaseless throng Has filed those paths along, Those painful hills ascended; Thro' fair meads of success, Thro' barren sands they press, Defeats and triumphs splendid, Till 'tis ended. The glory and the shame Different, and yet the same The efforts and the aspirations, Unlike in mien and speech, Pressed onwards each on each, Go the endless alternations Of the nations. And the rhythm of their feet, The ineffable low beat Of those vast throngs pacing slowly, Floats on the sea of Time Like a musical low chime From a far isle, mystic, holy, Tolling slowly. And from the endless column Goes up that strange rhyme solemn Of thoughts which naught shall sever, The contrast sad and sweet, Of opposite streams which meet; Sometimes the glad ‚ÄúFor ever,‚Äù Sometimes ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù COURAGE! There are who, bending supple knees, Live for no end except to please, Rising to fame by mean degrees; But creep not thou with these. They have their due reward; they bend Their lives to an unworthy end‚Äî On empty aims the pains expend Which had knit close a friend. But be not thou as these, whose mind Is to the passing hour confined; Let no ignoble fetters bind Thy soul, as free as wind. Stand upright, speak thy thought, declare The truth thou hast that all may share; Be bold, proclaim it everywhere: They only live who dare. GILBERT BECKETT AND THE FAIR SARACEN. The last crusader's helm had gleamed Upon the yellow Syrian shore; No more the war-worn standards streamed, The stout knights charged and fell no more; No more the Paynim grew afraid‚Äî The crescent floated o'er the cross. But to one simple Heathen maid Her country's gain was bitter loss; For love, which knows not race or creed, Had bound her with its subtle chain,‚Äî Love, which still makes young hearts to bleed, For this one, mingled joy with pain, And left for one brief hour of bliss, One little span of hopes and fears, The memory of a parting kiss, And what poor solace comes of tears. A lowly English squire was he, A prisoner chained, enslaved, and sold; A lady she of high degree. 'Tis an old tale and often told: 'Twas pity bade the brown cheek glow, 'Twas love and pity drew the sigh, 'Twas love that made the soft tear flow, The sweet sad night she bade him fly. Far from the scorching Syrian plain The brave ship bears the Saxon home; Once more to mists and rains again, And verdant English lawns, they come. I know not if as now 'twas then, Or if the growing ages move The careless, changeful hearts of men More slowly to the thoughts of love; But woman's heart was then, as now, Tender and passionate and true. Think, gentle ladies, ye who know Love's power, what pain that poor heart knew; How, living always o'er again The sweet short past, she knew, too late, 'Twas love had bound the captive's chain, Which broken, left her desolate. Till by degrees the full young cheek Grew hollow, and the liquid eyes Still gazing seaward, large and meek, Took something of a sad surprise; As one who learns, with a strange chill, 'Mid youth and wealth's unclouded day, Of sad lives full of pain and ill, And thinks, ‚ÄúAnd am I too as they?‚Äù And by degrees most hateful grew All things that once she held so dear‚Äî The feathery palms, the cloudless blue, Tall mosque and loud muezzin clear, The knights who flashed by blinded street, The lattice lit by laughing eyes, The songs around the fountain, sweet To maidens under Eastern skies. And oft at eve, when young girls told Tales precious to the girlish heart, She sat alone, and loved to hold Communion with her soul apart. Till at the last, too great became The hidden weight of secret care, And girlish fears and maiden shame Were gone, and only love was there. And so she fled. I see her still In fancy, desolate, alone, Wander by arid plain and hill, From early dawn till day was done; Sun-stricken, hungry, thirsty, faint, By perilous paths I see her move, Clothed round with pureness like a saint, And fearless in the might of love. Till lo! a gleam of azure sea, And rude ships moored upon the shore. Strange, yet not wholly strange, for he Had dared those mystic depths before. And some good English seaman bold, Remembering those he left at home, Put gently back the offered gold, And for love's honour bade her come. And then they sailed. No pirate bark Swooped on them, for the Power of Love Watched o'er that precious wandering ark, And this his tender little dove. I see those stalwart seamen still Gaze wondering on that childish form, And shelter her from harm and ill, And guide her safe through wave and storm. Till under grayer skies a gleam Of white, and taking land she went, Following our broad imperial stream, Or rose-hung lanes of smiling Kent. Friendless I see her, lonely, weak, Thro' fields where every flower was strange, Go forth without a word to speak, By burgh and thorp and moated grange. For all that Love himself could teach This passionate pilgrim to our shore, Were but two words of Saxon speech, Two little words and nothing more‚Äî ‚ÄúGilbert‚Äù and ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù; like a flame To her sweet lips these sounds would come, The syllables of her lover's name, And the far city of his home. I see her cool her weary feet In dewy depths of crested grass; By clear brooks fringed with meadow-sweet, And daisied meads, I see her pass; I see her innocent girlish glee, I see the doubts which on her crowd, O'erjoyed with bird, or flower, or tree, Despondent for the fleeting cloud. I see her passing slow, alone, By burgh and thorp and moated grange, Still murmuring softly like a moan Those two brief words in accents strange. Sometimes would pass a belted earl With squires behind in brave array; Sometimes some honest, toilworn churl Would fare with her till close of day. The saintly abbess, sweet and sage, Would wonder as she ambled by, Or white-plumed knight or long-haired page Ride by her with inquiring eye. The friar would cross himself, and say His paternosters o'er and o'er; The gay dames whisper Welladay! And pity her and nothing more. But tender women, knowing love And all the pain of lonelihood, Would feel a sweet compassion move, And welcome her to rest and food, And walk with her beyond the hill, And kiss her cheek when she must go; And ‚ÄúGilbert‚Äù she would murmur still, And ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù she would whisper low. And sometimes sottish boors would rise From wayside tavern, where they sate, And leer from heated vinous eyes, And stagger forth with reeling gait, And from that strong unswerving will And clear gaze shrink as from a blow; And ‚ÄúGilbert‚Äù she would murmur still, And ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù she would whisper low. Then by the broad suburban street, And city groups that outward stray To take the evening, and the sweet Faint breathings of the dying day‚Äî The gay young 'prentice, lithe and slim, The wimpled maid, demurely shy, The merchant somewhat grave and prim, The courtier with his rolling eye. And more and more the growing crowd Would gather, wondering whence she came And why, with boorish laughter loud, And jeers which burnt her cheek with flame. For potent charm to save from ill But one word she made answer now: For ‚ÄúGilbert‚Äù she would murmur still, And ‚ÄúGilbert‚Äù she would whisper low. Till some good pitiful soul‚Äînot then Our London was as now o'ergrown‚Äî Pressed through the idle throng of men, And led her to his home alone, And signing to her he would find Him whom she sought, went forth again And left her there with heart and mind Distracted by a new-born pain. For surely then, when doubt was o'er, A doubt before a stranger came, ‚ÄúHe loved me not, or loves no more.‚Äù Oh, virgin pride! oh, maiden shame! Almost she fled, almost the past Seemed better than the pain she knew; Her veil around her face she cast: Then the gate swung‚Äîand he was true. Poor child! they christened her, and so She had her wish. Ah, yearning heart, Was love so sweet then? would you know Again the longing and the smart? Came there no wintry hours when you Longed for your native skies again, The creed, the tongue your girlhood knew, Aye, even the longing and the pain? Peace! Love is Lord of all. But I, Seeing her fierce son's mitred tomb, Conjoin with fancy's dreaming eye This love tale, and that dreadful doom. Sped hither by a hidden will, O'er sea and land I watch her go; ‚ÄúGilbert‚Äù I hear her murmur still, And ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù still she whispers low. TO A CHILD OF FANCY. The nests are in the hedgerows, The lambs are on the grass; With laughter sweet as music Thy hours lightfooted pass, My darling child of fancy, My winsome prattling lass. Blue eyes, with long brown lashes, Thickets of golden curl, Red little lips disclosing Twin rows of fairy pearl, Cheeks like the apple blossom, Voice lightsome as the merle. A whole Spring's fickle changes In every short-lived day, A passing cloud of April, A flowery smile of May, A thousand quick mutations From graver moods to gay. Far off, I see the season When thy childhood's course is run, And thy girlhood opens wider Beneath the growing sun, And the rose begins to redden, But the violets are done. And further still the summer, When thy fair tree, fully grown, Shall burgeon, and grow splendid With blossoms of its own, And the fruit begins to gather, But the buttercups are mown. If I should see thy autumn, 'Twill not be close at hand, But with a spirit vision, From some far distant land. Or, perhaps, I hence may see thee Amongst the angels stand. I know not what of fortune The future holds for thee, Nor if skies fair or clouded Wait thee in days to be, But neither joy nor sorrow Shall sever thee from me. Dear child, whatever changes Across our lives may pass, I shall see thee still for ever, Clearly as in a glass, The same sweet child of fancy, The same dear winsome lass. A CYNIC'S DAY-DREAM. Some men there be who can descry No charm in earth or sea or sky, Poor painful bigot souls, to whom All sights and sounds recall the tomb, And some who do not fear to use God's world for tavern or for stews. Some think it wisdom to despoil Their years for gold and troublous toil; While others with cold dreams of art Would feed the hunger of the heart, And dilettanti dare to stand, Eternities on either hand! But with no one of these shall I Make choice to live my life or die,‚Äî Rather let me elect to give What span of life is mine to live, To honest labour, daily sought, Crowned with the meed of patient thought; To precious friends for ages dead, But loved where'er their words are read; To others living with us still, Who sway the nation's mind and will By eloquent pen or burning word, Where hearts are fired and souls are stirred. So thro' the tranquil evenings long, Let us awake our souls with song, Such song as comes where no words come, And is most mighty when most dumb. Then soar awhile on wings of art; Not that which chokes the vulgar mart, But subtle hints and fancies fine, When least completed most divine, Sun-copies of some perfect thought, Thro' bronze or canvas fitly wrought, Known when in youth 'twas ours to see Thy treasure-houses, Italy! Then turn from these to grave debate What change of laws befits the State, By what wise schemes and precepts best To raise the humble and oppressed, And slay the twin reproach of Time, The fiends of Ignorance and Crime. Or what if I might come to fill A calmer part, and dearer still, With one attempered soul to share The joys and ills 'tis ours to bear; To grow together, heart with heart, Into a whole where each is part; To blend together, soul with soul, Neither a part, but each the whole; With strange creative thrills to teach The dawning mind, the growing speech, To bind around me precious bands Of loving hearts and childish hands, And lose the stains of time and sense In those clear deeps of innocence? So if kind fate should grant at length, Ere frame and brain have lost their strength, In my own country homestead dear, To spend a portion of the year; What joys I'll prove if modest wealth Should come with still unbroken health! There, sheltered from the ruder wind, Thro' the thick woods we'll range, to find The spring's first flower, the autumn's fruit, Strange fungus or misshapen root. Mark where the wood-quist or the thrush Builds on tall pine or hazel bush; See the brave bird with speckled breast Brood fearless on the teeming nest, And bid the little hands refrain From every act of wrong and pain. Observe the gossip conies sit By their own doors, the white owl flit Thro' the dim fields, while I enjoy The wondering talk of girl or boy. Sweet souls, which at life's portal stand, And all within, a wonderland‚Äî Oh, treasure of a guileless love, Fit prelude of the joys above! There, when the swift week nears its end, To greet the welcome Sunday friend, Through the still fields we'll wend our way, To meet the guest at close of day. And then, when little eyes in vain Long time have sought the coming train, A gradual distant sound, which fills The bosom of the folded hills, Till with white steam or ruddy light The wayworn convoy leaps to sight, Then stops and sets the traveller down, Bringing the smoke and news of town. And then the happy hours to come, The walk or ride which leads us home, Past the tall woods through which 'twould seem Home's white walls hospitably gleam,‚Äî The well-served meal, the neighbour guest, The rosy darlings curled and dressed; And, when the house grows silent, then The lengthened talk on books and men; And on the Sunday morning still, The pleasant stroll by wood-crowned hill To church, wherein my eyes grow dim Hearing my children chant the hymn; And seeing in their earnest look Something of innocent rebuke, I lose the old doubt's endless pain, And am a little child again. If fate should grant me such a home, So sweet the tranquil days would come, I should not need, I trust, to sink My weariness in lust or drink. Scant pleasure should I think to gain From endless scenes of death and pain; 'Twould little profit me to slay A thousand innocents a day; I should not much delight to tear With wolfish dogs the shricking hare; With horse and hound to track to death A helpless wretch that gasps for breath; To make the fair bird check its wing, And drop, a dying, shapeless thing; To leave the joy of all the wood A mangled heap of fur and blood, Or else escaping, but in vain, To pine, a shattered wretch, in pain; Teeming, perhaps, or doomed to see Its young brood starve in misery; With neither risk nor labour, still To live for nothing but to kill‚Äî I dare not! If perplexed I am Between the tiger and the lamb; If fate ordain that these shall give Their poor brief lives that I may live: Whate'er the law that bids them die, Others shall butcher them, not I,‚Äî Not such my work. Surely the Lord, Who made the devils by a word, Not men, but those who'd wield them well Gave these sad tortures of his Hell. Ah! fool and blind, to wander so; Who hast lived long enough to know With what insane confusions teem The mazes of our waking dream,‚Äî The dullard surfeited with gold His bloated coffers fail to hold, While the keen mind and generous brain From penury aspire in vain; Love's choicest treasures flung away On some vile lump of coarsest clay; Pure girlhood chained to wretches foul, Tainted in body as in soul; The precious love of wife or child Not for the loving heart and mild, But for the sullen churl, who ne'er Knew any rule but that of fear; Fame, like Titania, stooping down To set on asses' ears a crown; The shallow dunce, the fluent fool, The butt and laughter of the school, By fortune's strange caprice grown great, A light of forum or debate; The carnal lump devoid of grace, With each bad passion in his face, A saintly idol, round whose knees Crowd throngs of burning devotees. Great heaven! how strange the tangle is, What old perplexity is this? The very words of my complaint, What else are they than echoes faint Of the full fire, the passionate scorn, Of high-souled singers and forlorn, Who, in our younger England, knew No care for aught but what was true, But loved to lash with bitter hate The shameless vices of the great; Who bade, in far-off days of Rome, In verse their indignation come; Who, when we learn the secrets hid Beneath the eldest Pyramid, Or in those dim days further still, Whose nameless ruin builds the hill, Push back our search where'er we can, Till first the ape became the man, Will in rude satire bid us find The earliest victories of mind? Strong souls, rebellious with their lot, Who longed for right and found it not; Too strong to take things as they seem, Too weak to comprehend the scheme, Too deeply fired with honest trust To dream that God might be unjust; Yet, seeing how unequal show His providences here below, By paradoxes girt about, Grew thro' excess of faith to doubt. Oh, faithful souls, who love the true, Tho' all be false, yet will not you; Tho' wrong shall overcome the right, Still it is hateful in your sight; Tho' sorely tempted, you, and tried, The truth stands always at your side; Tho' falsehood wear her blandest smile, You only she shall ne'er beguile; For you, 'mid spectral sights and shows, Life blushes with a hidden rose; Thro' the loud din of lower things You hear the sweep of angel wings, And with a holy scorn possest, Wait till these clamours sink to rest. TO A LOST LOVE. Cold snowdrops which the shrinking new-born year Sends like the dove from out the storm-tost ark; Sweet violets which may not tarry here Beyond the earliest flutings of the lark; Bright celandines which gild the tufted brake Before the speckled thrush her nest has made; Fair frail anemones which star-like shake And twinkle by each sunny bank and glade; Pale primroses wherewith the virgin spring, As with a garland, wreathes her comely head; No eyes have I for you, nor voice to sing. My love is dead! For she was young and pure and white as you, And fairer and more sweet, and ah! as frail. I dare not give to her the honour due, Lest, for a strain so high, my voice should fail. Like you, she knew the springtide's changeful hours; Like you, she blossomed ere the coming leaf; Like you, she knew not summer's teeming showers; Like you, as comely, and, alas! as brief. You may not see the roses, nor might she; Such swift short beauty is its only fruit; So a sweet silence is her eulogy, And praise is mute. IN MEMORY OF A FRIEND. Ernest Schalch, Attorney-General for Jamaica, who, with his only sister, died of yellow fever in February, 1874. Beneath the feathery fronds of palm The white stone of a double grave, And on the horizon, blue and calm, The tropic ocean wave. 'Twas three years since, no more, that thou, Dear friend, with us, in daily round, Didst labour where we labour now, 'Mid London's surge of sound. Treading the dull slow paths of law, With little of reward or gain, To feel a high ambition gnaw Thy heart with tooth of pain, And mark with scant content the crowd Fulfil the immemorial rule Which drives the fool with plaudits loud To glorify the fool. And so with patient scorn didst gain To winnow from the growing heap Of barren precedent the grain Which hides there buried deep. Till last, congenial labour came, To call thee o'er the tropic sea, And exile, gilt by toil and fame, Severed thy friends from thee. Brief as we hoped, but ah, how long! Though lit by news of days well spent, Of rights defined, of law made strong, Of rebels grown content, Of ordered codes so reasoned out, Speaking with voice so true and clear, That none who hear them still may doubt ‚Äú'Tis Justice speaketh here.‚Äù Yet not the less thou barest part In the old talk we loved before; The newest growths of thought or art Delighted more and more, And all the marvels of thy isle, The lavish wealth of sea and land, The skies with their too constant smile, Loud surf on breathless strand, The shallow nature fierce, yet gay, Of our dark brethren; thou didst learn, Noting‚Äîbut gazing, far away, With eyes that still would yearn, For that fair time when, toil being done, The happy day at length should come, When with our kindly autumn sun Thou should'st revisit home. It was this very year; and then The plague, which long time, dealing death, Had vexed the shores of kindred men, On those breathed deadly breath. And one, I know not who, their guest, Sickening, Love drew them forth to tend, Careless of needful food and rest, Their fever-stricken friend, Who owed to them life's refluent power; While for those duteous martyrs twain, Brother and Sister, one blest hour Brought one release from pain. Too generous natures! kindred souls!‚Äî And now, round those twin tombs the wave, Forgetful of their story, rolls, And the palms shade their grave. And we‚Äîwhat shall we say of thee?‚Äî Thou hast thy due reward, oh, friend‚Äî We serve a High Necessity, To an Invisible End. That waste nor halting comes at all In all the scheme is all we know; The force was formed that bade thee fall, Millions of years ago. The clouds of circumstance unite, The winds of fate together roll; They meet; there bursts a sudden light, And consecrates a soul! IT SHALL BE WELL. If thou shalt be in heart a child, Forgiving, tender, meek, and mild, Though with light stains of earth defiled, Oh, soul, it shall be well. It shall be well with thee indeed, Whate'er thy race, thy tongue, thy creed; Thou shalt not lose thy fitting meed. It shall be surely well. Not where, nor how, nor when we know, Nor by what stages thou shalt grow; We may but whisper faint and low, ‚ÄúIt shall be surely well.‚Äù It shall be well with thee, oh, soul, Tho' the heavens wither like a scroll; Tho' sun and moon forget to roll, Oh, soul, it shall be well. A REMONSTRANCE. If ever, for a passing day, My careless rhymes shall gain to please, I would that those who read may say, ‚ÄúLeft he no more than these?‚Äù' For sure it is a piteous thing That those blest souls to whom is given The instinct and the power to sing, The choicest gift of heaven, Not from high peak to peak alone Our faithful footsteps care to guide, But oft by plains of sand and stone, Dull wastes, and naught beside. Who the low crawling verse prolong, Careless alike of fame and time; The form, but not the soul of song‚Äî A dreary hum of rhyme. A straight road, by a stagnant stream, Where the winged steed, which late would soar From the white summits like a dream, Creeps slowly evermore. A babble of sound, like that flat noise Which, when the harmonies grow dumb, Between the symphony's awful joys, Too oft is heard to come. Grave error; since not all of life Is rhythmic; oft by level ways We walk; the sweet creative strife, The inspired heroic days, Are rare for all,‚Äîno food for song, Are common hours; and those who hold The gift, the inspiration strong, More precious far than gold, Only when heart is fired and brain, And the soul spreads its soaring wing, Only when nobler themes constrain, Should ever dare to sing. THIRD SERIES (1875). SONG. [Tell me where I may quench the too fierce fire] Tell me where I may quench the too fierce fire Of hope and of desire; Tell me how I may from my soul remove The sting and pain of love; Tell me, and I will give to thee, Magician, my whole soul in fee. And yet I know not what of fit reward, For enterprise so hard, I might convey thee in a loveless soul, Whose currents no more roll: A corpse, corruptible and cold, Were no great prize to have and hold. Time only is it that will deign to take Such things for their own sake, Preferring age to youth, grey hairs to brown, And to bright smiles the frown. Time takes the hope, Time dulls the smart, And first makes slow, then stops the heart. Wherefore to Time I will address my song. Time, equable and strong, Take thou all hope and longing clean away‚Äî And yet I prithee stay; Forbear, for rather I would be Consumed than turn to ice with thee. THE HOME ALTAR. Why should we seek at all to gain By vigils, and in pain, By lonely life and empty heart, To set a soul apart Within a cloistered cell, For whom the precious, homely hearth would serve as well? There, with the early breaking morn, Ere quite the day is born, The lustral waters flow serene, And each again grows clean; From sleep, as from a tomb, Born to another dawn of joy, and hope, and doom. There through the sweet and toilsome day, To labour is to pray; There love with kindly beaming eyes Prepares the sacrifice; And voice and innocent smile Of childhood do our cheerful liturgies beguile. There, at his chaste and frugal feast, Love sitteth as a Priest; And with mild eyes and mien sedate, His deacons stand and wait; And round the holy table Paten and chalice range in order serviceable. And when ere night, the vespers said, Low lies each weary head, What giveth He who gives them sleep, But a brief death less deep? Or what the fair dreams given But ours who, daily dying, dream a happier heaven? Then not within a cloistered wall Will we expend our days; But dawns that break and eves that fall Shall bring their dues of praise. This best befits a Ruler always near, This duteous worship mild, and reasonable fear. THE VOYAGE. Who climbs the Equatorial main Drives on long time through mist and cloud, Through zones of storm, through thunders loud, For many a night of fear and pain. Till one night all is clear, and lo! He sees with wondering, awe-struck eyes, In depths above, in depths below, Strange constellations light the skies‚Äî New stars, more splendid and more fair, Yet not without a secret loss: He seeks in vain the Northern Bear, And finds instead the Southern Cross. Yet dawns the self-same sun‚Äîthe same The deep below the keel which lies; Though this may burn with brighter flame, And that respond to bluer skies, The self-same earth, the self-same sky: And though through clouds and tempests driven, The self-same seeker lifts an eye That sees another side of heaven. No change in man, or earth, or aught, Save those strange secrets of the night; Nor there, save that another thought Has reached them through another sight, Which may but know one hemisphere, The earth's mass blotting out the blue, Till one day, leaving shadows here, It sees all heaven before its view. THE FOOD OF SONG. How best doth vision come To the poet's mind,‚Äî Lonely beneath the blue, unclouded dome, Or battling with the mighty ocean-wind; In fair spring mornings, with the soaring lark, Or amid roaring midnight forests dark? Shall he attune his voice To sweetest song, When earth and sea and sky alike rejoice, And men are blest, and think no thought of wrong, In some ideal heaven, some happy isle, Where life is stiffened to a changeless smile? Or best amid the noise Of high designs, Loud onsets, shatterings, awful battle-joys, Wherefor the loftier spirit longs and pines; Or by the depths of Thought's unfathomed sea; Or to loud thunders of the Dawn to be? Nature is less than naught In smile or frown, But for the formless, underlying thought Of mind and purpose greater than our own; This only can these empty shows inform, Smiles through the calm, and animates the storm. Nor 'mid the clang and rush Of mightier thought, The steeps, the snows, the gulfs, that whelm and crush The seeker with the treasure he has sought; Too vast, too swift, too formless to inspire The fictive hand, or touch the lips with fire. Rather amid the throng Of toiling men He finds the food and sustenance of song, Spread by hidden hands, again, and yet again, Where'er he goes, by crowded city street, He fares thro' springing fancies sad and sweet. Some innocent baby smile; A close-wound waist; Fathers and children; things of shame and guile; Dim eyes, and lips at parting kissed in haste; The halt, the blind, the prosperous thing of ill; The thief, the wanton, touch and vex him still. Or if sometimes he turn With a new thrill, And strives to paint anew with words that burn The inner thought of sea, or sky, or hill: It is because a breath of human life Has touched them: joy and suffering, rest and strife. And he sees mysteries Above, around, Fair spiritual fleeting agencies Haunting each foot of consecrated ground: And so, these fading, raises bolder eyes Beyond the further limits of the skies, And every thought and word, And all things seen, And every passion which his heart has stirred, And every joy and sorrow which has been, And every step of life his feet have trod, Lead by broad stairs of glory up to God. THE YOUTH OF THOUGHT. Oh happy days! oh joyous time! When thought was gay and man was young, And to a golden flow of rhyme, Life like a melody was sung; When, in the springtime of the earth, The cloud-capt hill, the dewy grove, Clear lake and rippling stream gave birth To shy Divinities of love; When often to the jovial feast Of love or wine the people came, And Nature was the only priest, And Youth and Pleasure knew not shame. Nor darker shape of wrong or ill The fearful fancy might inspire, Than vine-crowned on some shady hill, The Satyr nursing quaint desire. And if some blooming youth or maid In depths of wood or stream were lost, Some love-lorn Deity, 'twas said, The blissful truant's path had crossed. Sweet time of fancy, giving place To times of thinking scarce less blest, When Wisdom wore a smiling face, And Knowledge was like Fancy drest, And Art with Language lived ingrown, The cunning hand and golden tongue: By this the form Divine was shown, By that its deathless praises sung. When in cool temples fair and white, By purple sea, or myrtle shade, The gods took shape to mortal sight, By their own creatures' hands remade. And daily, to the cheerful noise Of wrestling, or the panting race‚Äî Mid the clear laughter of the boys, And tender forms of youthful grace‚Äî Grave sages walked in high debate Beneath the laurel grove, and sought To solve the mysteries of Fate, And sound the lowest deeps of Thought; Nor knew that they, as those indeed, Were naked, taking fair for right; With beauty only for all creed, Yet not without some heaven-sent light. Now preaching clear the deathless soul; Now winging love from sloughs of shame; And oft from earthly vapours foul, Soaring aloft with tongues of flame. Knew they no inward voice to vex The careless joyance of their way‚Äî No pointing finger stern, which checks The sad transgressor of to-day? Fair dream, if any dream be fair, Which knows no fuller life than thine; Which only moves through earthly air, And builds on shadows half divine; How art thou fled! For us no more Dryad or Satyr haunts the grove; No Nereid sports upon the shore, Nor with wreathed horn the Tritons rove; Who breathe a fuller, graver air, Long since to manhood's stature grown; Who leave our childhood's fancies fair, For pains and pleasures of our own. For us no more the young vine climbs, Its gadding tendrils flinging down; Who move in sadder, wiser times, Whose thorns are woven for a crown. The lily and the passion-flower Preach a new tale of gain and loss, And in the wood-nymph's closest bower The springing branches form the Cross. ‚ÄúA great hope traversing the earth,‚Äù Has taken all the young world's bloom, And for the joy and flush of birth, Has left the solemn thought of doom; And made the body no more divine, And built our Heaven no longer here, And given for joyous fancies fine, Souls bowed with holy awe and fear. And far beyond the suns, removed The godhead seen by younger eyes, Leaving the people once beloved, Girt round by dreadful mysteries; Fulfilled with thoughts, more fair and dear Than all the lighter joys of yore, Immeasurable hopes brought near, And Heaven laid open more and more. But not with love and peace alone Time came, which older joys could take; But with fierce brand and hopeless groan, Red war, the dungeon, and the stake; And lives by Heaven too much opprest, And cloisters dim with tears and sighs, And young hearts withered in the breast, And fasts and stripes and agonies; And for Apollo breathing strength, And Aphrodit√© warm with life; A tortured Martyr come at length, To the last pang of life long strife. While round us daily move no more Those perfect forms of youthful grace, No more men worship as before The rounded limb, the clear-cut face; Who see the dwarfed mechanic creep, With hollow cheek, and lungs that bleed, Or the swart savage fathom-deep, Who comes to air, to sleep, and breed. Aye, but by loom, or forge, or mine, Or squalid hut, there breaks for these Hope more immense, awe more divine Than ever dawned on Sokrates. Who if they seek to live again In careless lives the pagan charm, May only prove a lifelong pain, For that clear conscience void of harm. For in the manhood of God's days We live, and not in careless youth; The essence more than form we praise, And Beauty moves us less than Truth. From youth to age; till cycles hence Another and a higher Spring, And with a truer innocence, Again the world shall think and sing. SONG. [I would thou might'st not vex me with thine eyes] I would thou might'st not vex me with thine eyes, Thou fair Ideal Beauty, nor would'st shame All lower thoughts and visions as they rise, As in mid-noon a flame. For now thy presence leaves no prospect fair, Nor joy in act, nor charm in any maid, Nor end to be desired, for which men dare, Thou making me afraid. Because life seems through thee a thing too great To spend on these, which else might grow to thee; So that fast bound, I idly hesitate: I prithee set me free; Or, hold me, if thou wilt, but come not near, Let me pursue thee still in ghostly grace; Far off let me pursue thee, for I fear To faint before thy face. AT CHAMBERS. To the chamber, where now uncaring I sit apart from the strife, While the fool and the knave are sharing The pleasures and profits of life, There came a faint knock at the door, Not long since on a terrible day; One faint little knock, and no more; And I brushed the loose papers away. And as no one made answer, I rose, With quick step and impatience of look, And a glance of the eye which froze, And a ready voice of rebuke. But when the door opened, behold! A mother, low-voiced and mild, Whose thin shawl and weak arms enfold A pale little two-year-old child. What brought her there? Would I relieve her? Was all the poor mother could say; For her child, scarce recovered from fever, Left the hospital only that day. Pale, indeed, was the child; yet so cheerful, That, seeing me wonder, she said, Of doubt and repulse, grown fearful, ‚ÄúPlease look at his dear little head;‚Äù And snatched off the little bonnet, And so in a moment laid bare A shorn little head, and upon it No trace of the newly-come hair. When, seeing the stranger's eye Grow soft; of an innocent guile The child looked up, shrinking and shy, With the ghost of a baby smile. Poor child! I thought, so soon come To the knowledge of lives oppressed, To whom poverty comes with home, And sickness brings food and rest: Who art launched forth, a frail little boat, In the midst of life's turbulent sea, To sink, it may be, or to float On great waves that care nothing for thee. What awaits thee? An early peace In the depths of a little grave, Or, despite all thy ills to increase, Through some dark chance, mighty to save; Till in stalwart manhood you meet The strong man, who regards you today, Crawling slowly along the street, In old age withered and gray? Who knows? But the thoughts I have told In one instant flashed through my brain, As the poor mother, careful of cold, Clasped her infant to her again. And I, if I searched for my purse, Was I selfish, say you, and wrong? Surely silver is wasted worse Than in earning the right to a song! EVENSONG. The hymns and the prayers were done, and the village church was still, As I lay in a waking dream in the churchyard upon the hill. The graves were all around, and the dark yews over my head, And below me the winding stream and the exquisite valley were spread. The sun was sloping down with a glory of dying rays, And the hills were bathed in gold, and the woods were vocal with praise. But from the deep set valley there rose a vapour of gray, And the sweet day sank, and the glory waxed fainter and faded away. Then there came, like a chilling wind, a cold, low whisper of doubt, Which silenced the echo of hymns, and blotted the glories out. And I wrestled with powers unseen, and strove with a Teacher divine, Like Jacob who strove with the angel, and found with the dawn a sign. For I thought of the words they sang: ‚ÄúIt is He that hath made us indeed‚Äù; And my thought flew back to the Fathers of thought and their atheist creed‚Äî How atom with atom at first fortuitously combined, Formed all, from the worlds without to the innermost worlds of mind; And I thought: What, if this be true, and no Maker there is indeed, And God is the symbol alone of a feeble and worn-out creed; And from uncreate atoms impelled by a blind chance driving on free, Grew together the primal forms of all essences that be! Then a voice: If they were, indeed, they were separate one from one By a gulph as broad as yawns in space betwixt sun and sun‚Äî Self-centred and self-contained, disenvironed and isolate; Drawn together by a hidden love, torn apart by a hidden hate. What power was this‚Äîchance, will you say? But chance, what else can it mean Than the hidden Cause of things by human reason unseen? Chance! Then Chance were a name for God, or each atom bearing a soul Indivisible, like with like, part and whole of the Infinite Whole. Were God, as the Pantheist taught, God in earth, and in sky, and in air, God through every thought and thing, and made manifest everywhere; The spring and movement of things‚Äîthe stir, the breathing of breath, Without which all things were quenched in the calm of an infinite death; Or, if within each there lay some germ of an unborn power, God planted it first, God quickened, God raised it from seed to flower. Though beneath the weird cosmical force, which we wield and yet cannot name, From the germ or the rock we draw out low gleams of life's faintest flame; Though we lose the will that commands, and the muscles that wait and serve, In some haze of a self-set spring of the molecules of nerve; Though we sink all spirit in matter, and let the Theogonies die, Life and death are; thinker and thought; outward, inward; I, and not I, And the I is the Giver of life, and without it the matter must die. Then I ceased for a while from thought, as I lay on the long green grass, Hearing echoes of hymns anew, and letting the moments pass. The evening was mounting upward; the sunbeams had left the hill; But the dying daylight lingered, and all the valley was still. Then I said: But if God there be, how shall man by his thinking find, Who is only a finite creature, the depths of the Infinite Mind‚Äî Who sounds with a tiny plummet, who scans with a purblind eye, The depths of that fathomless ocean, the wastes of that limitless sky? Shall we bow to a fetish, a symbol, which maybe nor sees nor hears; Or, seeing and hearing indeed, takes no thought for our hopes or fears; Who is dumb, though we long for a word; who is deaf, though his children cry; Who is Master, yet bears with ill‚ÄîLord, and lets all precious things die? Or if in despair we turn from the godless and meaningless plan, What do we, but make for ourselves a God in the image of man‚Äî A creature of love and hate, a creature who makes for good, But barred by an evil master from working the things that he would? If he be not a reflex image, we may not know him at all; If he be, we are God ourselves‚Äîto ourselves we shall stand or fall. Then the voice: But what folly is this! Cannot God indeed be known, If we know not the hidden essence that forms Him and builds His throne? Is all our knowledge naught, of sea, and of sky, and of star, Till we know them, not as they seem to our thinking, but as they are? We who build the whole fabric of knowledge on vague abstractions sublime; We who whirl through an infinite Space, and live in an infinite Time; We who prate of Motion and Force, not knowing that on either side Black gulphs unavoidable yawn, dark riddles our thought deride; Shall we hold our science as naught in all things of earth, because We know but the seemings and shows, the relations, and not the cause‚Äî Not only as he who admires the rainbow and cloud of gold, Knows that 'tis but a form of vapour his wondering eyes behold; But as he who sees and knows, and knowing would fain ignore What he knows since the essence of things is hid, and he knows not more‚Äî Or who would not love his love, or walk hand in hand with his friend, Since he sees not the roots of the tree from whose branches life's blossoms depend! Or how should the sight we see, any more than the sound we hear, Be a thing which exists for our thought, apart from the eye or the ear; Is not every atom of dust, which compacted we call the earth, A miracle baffling our thought with insoluble wonders of birth? And know we not, indeed, that the matter which men have taught, Is itself an essence unseen and untouched‚Äîbut by spirit and thought? Tush! It is but a brain-sick dream. What was it that taught us the laws Which stand as a bar between us and the thought of the Infinite Cause? Is He infinite, out of relation, and absolute, past finding out? Reach we not an antinomy here? feel we here no striving of doubt? How, then, shall the finite define the bounds of the infinite plan, This is finite, and infinite this: here is Deity, here is man? If our judgment be relative only, how then shall our brain transcend The limits of relative thought; grown too eager to comprehend? For he passes the bounds of relation, if any there be who can Distinguish the absolute God from the relative in man: He has bridged the gulph; he has leaped o'er the bound; he has seen with his eyes For a moment the land unseen, that beyond the mountain peaks lies. Nay! we see but a part of God, since we gaze with a finite sight; And yet not Darkness is He, but a blinding splendour of light. Do we shrink from this light, and let our dazzled eyeballs fall? Nay, a God fully known or utterly dark, were not God at all. Though we hold not that in some sphere which our thought may never conceive, There comes not a time when, to know may be all, and not, to believe; Nor yet that the right which we love, and the wrong which we hate to-day, May not show as reversed, or as one, when the finite has passed away; God we know in our image indeed, since we are in the image of Him, Of His splendour a faint low gleam, of His glory a reflex dim. Bowing not to the all unknown, nor to that which is searched out quite; But to That which is known, yet unknown‚Äîto the darkness that comes of light, To the contact of God with man, to the struggle and triumph of right. Then I ceased for a while from thought, as I lay on the long green grass, Hearing echoes of hymns grown nearer, and letting the moments pass. Exult, oh dust and ashes! the low voices seemed to say; And then came a sudden hush, and the jubilance faded away. The evening was dying now, and the moon-rise was on the hill, And the soft light touched the river, and all the valley was still. Then I thought: But if God there be, and our thought may reach Him indeed, How should this bare knowledge alone stand in lieu of a fuller creed? If He be and is good, as they say, how yet can our judgment approve, 'Mid the rule of His iron laws, the place of His infinite love? The rocks are built up of death, earth and sea teem with ravin and wrong; The sole law in Nature we learn, is the law that strengthens the strong. Through countless ages of time, the Lord has withdrawn Him apart From all the world He has made, save the world of the human heart. Without and within all is pain, from the cry of the child at birth, To its parting sigh in age, when it looks for a happier earth. Should you plead that God's order goes forth with a measured footstep sublime, Know you not that you thrust Him back thus to the first beginnings of time,‚Äî That a spark, a moment, a flash, and His work was over and done; And the worlds were sent forth for ever, each circling around its sun. Bearing with it all secrets of being, all potencies undefined, All forms and changes of matter, all growths and achievements of mind. What is there for our worship in this, and should not our reason say, He is, and made us indeed, but hides Him too far away? Though He lives, yet is He as one dead; and we, who would prostrate fall Before the light of His Presence, we see not nor know Him at all. Then the voice: Oh folly of doubt! what is time that we deem so far, What else but a multiple vast of the little lives that are? He who lives for the fifty years, which scarce rear thought to its prime, Already a measure has lived of a thousand years of time. Twice this, and Christ spoke not yet, and from this what a span appears, The space till our thought is lost in the mists of a million years! A thousand millions of years‚Äîwe have leapt with a thought, with a word; To the time when no flutter of life 'neath the shield of the trilobite stirred. All time is too brief for our thought, and yet we would bring God nigh, Till He worked in His creature's sight, man standing undazzled by. Such a God were not God indeed; nor, if He should change at all, Should we hold, as we hold Him now, the God of both great and small. How know we the great things from small? how mark we the adequate cause, Which might make the Creator impede the march of His perfect laws,‚Äî We, who know but a part, not the whole? Or were it a fitting thought He should stoop in our sight to amend the errors His hand had wrought, So His laws were not perfect at all? or should He amend them indeed, How supply by a fitful caprice the want of a normal creed? All life is a mode of force, and all force that is force must move; 'Tis a friction of Outward and Inward, a contrast of Hatred and Love. Joy and Grief, Right and Wrong, Life and Death, Finite, Infinite, Matter and Will, These are the twin wheels of the Chariot of Life, which without them stood still. Would you seek in an order reversed and amended a Hand divine? Nay the Wonder of wonders lies in unchangeable design. Should God break His law as He might; should He stoop from His infinite skies To redress that which seems to us wrong, to raise up the life that dies; Should He save from His wolf His lamb, from His tiger His innocent child; Should He quench the fierce flames, or still the great waves clamouring wild, I think a great cry would go up from an orderless Universe, And all the fair fabric of things would wither, as under a curse. 'Tis the God of the savage, is this. What do we who rise by degrees To the gift of the mind that perceives, and the gift of the eye that sees? Does not all our nature tend to a law of unbending rule, Till equity comes but to mend the law that was made by the fool? Who shows highest?‚Äîthe child or the savage, whose smiles change to rage or to tears? Or the statesman moving, unmoved, through a nation's desires and fears? Or the pilgrim whose eyes look onward, as if to a distant home, Never turning aside from his path, whatever allurements may come? All Higher is more Unmoved; and the more unbroken the law, The more sure does the Giver show to the eyes of a wondering awe. Nor is it with all of truth that they make their voices complain, Who weary our thought with tales of a constant ruin and pain. It is but a brain-sick dream that would gloat o'er the hopeless bed, Or the wreck, or the crash, or the fight, with their tales of the dying or dead. Pain comes; hopeless pain, God knows and we know, again and again; But even pain has its intervals blest, when 'tis heaven to be free from pain. And I think that the wretch who lies pressed by a load of incurable ill, With a grave pity pities himself, but would choose to have lived to it still; And, as he whom the tiger bears in his jaws to his blood-stained den Feels no pain nor fear, but a wonder, what comes in the wonderful ‚ÄúThen,‚Äù He pities himself and yet knows, as he casts up life's chequered sum, It were best on the whole to have lived, whatever calamity come. And the earth is full of joy. Every blade of grass that springs; Every cool worm that crawls content as the eagle on soaring wings; Every summer day instinct with life; every dawn when from waking bird And morning hum of the bee, a chorus of praise is heard; Every gnat that sports in the sun for his little life of a day; Every flower that opens its cup to the dews of a perfumed May; Every child that wakes with a smile, and sings to the ceiling at dawn; Every bosom which knows a new hope stir beneath its virginal lawn; Every young soul, ardent and high, rushing forth into life's hot fight; Every home of happy content, lit by love's own mystical light; Every worker who works till the evening, and earns before night his wage, Be his work a furrow straight-drawn, or the joy of a bettered age; Every thinker who, standing aloof from the throng, finds a high delight In striking with tongue or with pen a stroke for the triumph of right;‚Äî All these know that life is sweet; all these, with a consonant voice, Read the legend of Time with a smile, and that which they read is, ‚ÄúRejoice!‚Äù Then again I ceased from thought, as I lay on the long green grass, Hearing hymns which grew fuller and fuller, and letting the moments pass. Exult, oh dust and ashes! exult and rejoice! they said, For bless√©d are they who live, and bless√©d are they who are dead. Then again they ceased and were still, and my thought began once more, But touched with a silvery gleam of hopes that were hidden before; The moon had climbed up the clear sky, far above the black pines on the hill, And the river ran molten silver, and all the valley was still. Then I said: But if God there be, who made us indeed and is good, What guide has He left for our feet to walk in the ways that He would? For though He should speak indeed, yet, as soon as His voice grew dumb, It were only through human speech that the message it bore might come, Sunk to levels of human thought, and always marred and confined By the chain of a halting tongue; and the curse of a finite mind; So that he who would learn, indeed, what precepts His will has taught, Must dim with a secular learning the brightness his soul has sought. Who can tell how those scattered leaves through gradual ages grew, Adding chaff and dust from the world to the accents simple and true? If one might from the seer's wild visions, or stories of fraud and blood, Or lore of the world-worn Sultan, discern the sure voice of good, Such a mind were a God to itself; or if you should answer, For each God has set a sure mentor within, with power to convince and teach; Yet it speaks with a changeful voice, which alters with race and clime, Nay, even in the self-same lands is changed with the changes of time; So that 'twixt the old Europe of story and that which we know to-day, Yawns a gulph, as wide almost as parts us from far Cathay; What power has such voice to help us? Or if we should turn instead To the precious dissonant pages, which keep what the Teacher said; How reduce them to one indeed, or how seek in vain to ignore The forgotten teachers who taught His counsels of mercy before? Not ‚Äúan eye for an eye‚Äù alone, was the rule which they loved to teach, But Mercy, and Pity, and Love, though they spoke with a halting speech, And He spake with the tongue of those who had spoken and then were dumb, And clothed in the words of the Law, which He loved, would His precepts come; Other teachers have drawn more millions, who follow more faithful than we; Other teachers have taught a rule as stern and unselfish as He. If we shrink from the Caliph fierce, who carved out a faith with his sword, What say we of the pilgrim who sways the old East with his gentle word? Or what of the sage whose vague thoughts, over populous wastes of earth, Have led millions of fettered feet to the grave from the day of birth? Or how can we part indeed, the show, the portent, the sign, From the simple words which glow with the light of a teaching Divine? And if careless of these, as of growths which spring up and bear fruit and fall, Yet how shall our thought accept the crowning wonder of all? Yet if this we reject, wherein, doth our faith and assurance lie? What is it to us that God lives, we who live for a little and die; Or why were it not more wise to live as the beasts of to-day, Taking life, while it lasts, as a gift, and secure of the future as they? Then the voice: Oh, disease of doubt! now I seem to hold you indeed, Keeping fast in my grasp at length the sum of your dreary creed. How else should man prove God's will, than through methods of human thought? How else than through human words should he gather the things that he ought? If the Lord should speak day by day from Sinai, in clouds and in fire, Should we hear 'mid those thunders loud the still voices which now inspire? Would not either that awful sound, like that vivid and scorching blaze, Confuse our struggling thought, and our tottering footsteps amaze? Or, if it should peal so clear that to hear were to obey indeed, 'Twere a thing of dry knowledge alone, not one of a faithful creed; No lantern for erring feet, but a glare on a white, straight road, Where life struggled its weary day, to sink before night with its load; Where the blinded soul might long for the shade of a cloud of doubt, And yearn for dead silence, to blot that terrible utterance out. Yet God is not silent indeed; not seldom from every page‚Äî From the lisping story of eld to the seer with his noble rage; From the simple life divine, with its accents gentle and true, To the thinker who formed by his learning and watered the faith as it grew; All are fired by the Spirit of God. Nor true is the doubt you teach, That God speaks not to all men the same, but differs 'twixt each and each. Each differs from each a little, with difference of race and of clime; Each is changed, but not transformed, with the onward process of time; Each nation, each age, has its laws, whereto it shall stand or fall, But built on a wider Law, which is under and over them all. Nor doubt we that from Western wilds to the long-sealed isles of Japan, There runs the unbroken realm of a Law that is common to man. Not as ours shows the law they obey, and yet it is one and the same, Though it comes in a varying shape, and is named by another name. Not so shall your doubt prevail; nor if any should dream to-day, By praise of Jew or of Greek, to dissolve His glory away, Can they hold that God left His world with no gleam of glory from Him, No light clouds edged with splendour, no radiance of Godhead dim. Others were before Christ had come. Oh! dear dead Teacher, whose word, Long before the sweet voice on the Hill, young hearts had quickened and stirred; Who spak'st of the soul and the life; with limbs chilled by the rising death, Yielding up to thy faith, with a smile, the last gasp of thy earthly breath;‚Äî And thou, oh golden-mouthed sage, who with brilliance of thought as of tongue, Didst sing of thy Commonwealth fair, the noblest of epics unsung; In whose pages thy Master's words shine forth, sublimed and refined In the music of perfect language, inspired by a faithful mind;‚Äî And ye seers of Israel and doctors, whose breath was breathed forth to move The dry dead bones of the Law with the life of a larger love;‚Äî Or thou, great Saint of the East, in whose footsteps the millions have trod Till from life, like an innocent dream, they pass'd and were lost in God;‚Äî And thou, quaint teacher of old, whose dead words, though all life be gone, Through the peaceful Atheist realms keep the millions labouring on;‚Äî Shall I hold that ye, as the rest, spake no echo of accents divine, That no gleam of a clouded sun through the mists of your teaching may shine? Nay; such thoughts were to doubt of God. Yet, strange it is and yet sure, No teacher of old was full of mercy as ours, or pure. 'Twixt the love that He taught, and the Greek's with its foul abysses of shame, Lies the gulph between Heaven's calm light and the fumes of sulphurous flame; 'Twixt His rule of a Higher Mercy and that which the Rabbi taught, Lies the gulph between glowing Act and barren ashes of Thought. For the pure thought smirched and fouled, or buried in pedant lore, He brought a sweet Reason of Force, such as man knew never before. What to us are the men of the East, though they preach their own Gospel indeed? We are men of the West, and shall stand or fall by a Western creed. Though we see in those Scriptures antique, faint flames of Diviner fire, Who would change to Buddha from Christ, as a change from lower to higher? Nay! He is our Teacher indeed. Little boots it to-day to seek To arraign, with a laboured learning, the words that men heard Him speak; To cavil, to carp, to strive, through the mists of an age-long haze, To dim to a common light the star which could once amaze; To fix by some pigmy canon, too short for the tale of to-day, The facts of a brief life, fled eighteen centuries away; To mark by a guess, and to spurn, as born of a later age, The proofs which, whenever writ, bear God's finger on every page; Or to sneer at the wonders they saw Him work, or believed they saw; We who know that unbending sequence is only a phase of law, No wonder which God might do if it rested on witness of men, Would turn to it our thought of to-day as it turned the multitude then. Nor proved would avail a whit if the teaching itself were not pure; Nor if it were pure as His would make it one whit more sure. And for the great Wonder of all. If any there be who fears That the spark of God in his breast may be quenched in a few short years; Who feels his faith's fire blaze aloft more clear than it burnt before, By the thought of the empty tomb and the stone rolled back from the door: For him was the miracle done. If no proof makes clearer to me Than His word to my inner sense, the Higher life that shall be; If no Force that has once leapt forth can ever decline and fall, From the dead forces stirring the worlds, to the Life-force which dominates all; But the sum of life is the same, and shall be when the world is done, As it was when its first faint spark was stirred by the kiss of the sun; If I feel a sure knowledge within, which shall never be blotted out, A Longing, a Faith, a Conviction, too strong for a Whisper of Doubt That my life shall be hid with a Lord, who shall do the thing that is best‚Äî To be purged, it may be, long time, or taken at once to rest,‚Äî To live, it may be, myself; from all else, individual, sole, Or blended with other lives, or sunk in the Infinite whole‚Äî Though I doubt not that that which is I may endure in the ages to be, Since I know not what bars hold apart the Not-Me and the mystical Me;‚Äî How else than thro' Him do I grasp the faith that for Greek and Jew Was hidden, or but dimly seen, which nor Moses nor Sokrates knew? Ay! He is our Teacher indeed. He is risen, and we shall rise; But if only as we He rose, not the less He lives in the skies. And if those who proclaim Him to-day in the dim gray lands of the East, Prove him not by portent or sign, not by trick or secret of priest; But for old cosmogonies dead, and faint precepts too weak for our need, Offer God brought nearer to man in a living and glowing creed. The pure teaching, the passionate love, taking thought for the humble and weak, The pitiful scorn of wrong, which His Scriptures everywhere speak, Not writ for the sage in his cell, but preached 'mid the turmoil and strife, And touched with a living brand from the fire of the Altar of Life. So, of all the wonders they tell, no wonder our hearts has stirred Like the Wonder which lives with us still in a living and breathing Word. More than all the marvels, the portents, that dazzled the worshippers' eyes, Ay, or even the joy of a Presence caught up and lost in the skies, This the crowning miracle shows, before which we must prostrate fall; For this is the living voice of the Lord and Giver of all. Then I ceased again from thought, as I lay on the long grave-grass, Thrilled through by a music of hymns, and letting the moments pass. ‚ÄúExult and rejoice!‚Äù they sang in high unison, now combined Which were warring voices before, the voices of heart and mind. The earth was flooded with light, over valley and river and hill, And this is the hymn which I heard them sing, while the world lay still: ‚ÄúExult, oh dust and ashes! Rejoice, all ye that are dead! For ye live too who lie beneath, as we live who walk overhead. As God lives, so ye are living; ye are living and moving to-day, Not as they live who breathe and move, yet living and conscious as they. And ye too, oh living, exult. Young and old, exult and rejoice; For the Lord of the quick and the dead lives for ever: we hear His voice. We have heard His voice, and we hear it sound wider and more increased, To the sunset plains of the West from the peaks of the furthest East. For the quick and the dead, it was given; for them it is sounding still, And no pause of silence arrests the clear voice of the Infinite Will. Not only through Christ long since, and the teachers of ages gone, But to-day He speaks, day by day, to those who are toiling on; More clear perhaps then, to the ear, and with nigher voice and more plain, But still the same Teacher Divine, speaking to us again and again. For I like not his creed, if any there be, who shall dare to hold That God comes to us only at times far away in the centuries old. Not so; but He dwells with us still; and maybe, though I know not indeed, He will send us a Christ again, with a fuller and perfecter creed‚Äî A Christ who shall speak to all men, East and West, and North and South, Till the whole world shall hear and believe the gracious words of His mouth. When knowledge has pierced through the wastes, chaining earth together and sea, And the bars of to-day are lost in the union of all that shall be; And the brotherhood that He loved is more than a saintly thought, And the wars and the strifes which we mourn are lost in the peace He taught; Then Christ coming shall make all things new. Or it may be that ages of pain Shall quench the dim light of to-day, bringing back the thick darkness again. And then, slow as the tide which flows on though each wave may seem to recede, Man advances again and again to the Rock of a higher creed. Or it may be no teacher shall come down again with God in his face, But the light which before was reflected from One shall shine on the Race. And as this wide earth grows smaller, and men to men nearer draw, There may spring from the root of the race the flower of a nobler law, Growing fairer, and still more fair; or maybe, through long ages of time, Man shall rise up from type to type, to the strength of an essence sublime, Removed as far in knowledge, in length of life, and in good From us, as we from the mollusc which gasped in the first warm flood,‚Äî A creature so wise and so high that he scorns all allurement of ill, Marching on through an ordered life in the strength of a steadfast will. Who knows? But, however it be, we live, and shall live indeed, In ourselves or in others to come. What more doth our longing need? Hid with God, or on earth, we shall see, burning brighter and yet more bright, The sphere of humanity move throughout time on its pathway of light; Circling round with a narrower orbit, as age upon age fleets away, The Centre of Force and of Being, the Fountain of Light and of Day, Till, nearer drawn, and more near, at last it shall merge and fall In its source; man is swallowed in God, the Part is lost in the All; One more world is recalled to rest, one more star adds its fire to the sun, One light less wanders thro' space, and the story of man is done!‚Äù Then slowly I rose to go from my place on the long grave-grass, Where so long I had lain in deep musings, letting the moments pass: A great light was flooding the plains of the earth and the uttermost sky, The low church and the deep sunk vale, and the place where one day I shall lie, The fresh graves of those we have lost, the dark yews with their reverend gloom, And the green wave which only marks the place of the nameless tomb; And thro' all the clear spaces above‚Äîoh wonder! oh glory of Light!‚Äî Came forth myriads on myriads of worlds, the shining host of the night,‚Äî The vast forces and fires that know the same sun and centre as we; The faint planets which roll in vast orbits round suns we shall never see; The rays which had sped from the first, with the awful swiftness of light, To reach only then, it might be, the confines of mortal sight: Oh, wonder of Cosmical Order! oh, Maker and Ruler of all, Before whose Infinite greatness in silence we worship and fall! Could I dream that the Will which keeps this great Universe steadfast and sure Might be less than His creatures thought, full of goodness, pitiful, pure? Could I dream that the Power which keeps those great suns circling around, Took no thought for the humblest life which flutters and falls to the ground? ‚ÄúOh, Faith! thou art higher than all.‚Äù Then I turned from the glories above, And from every casement new-lit there shone a soft radiance of love: Young mothers were teaching their children to fold little hands in prayer; Strong fathers were resting from toil, 'mid the hush of the Sabbath air; Peasant lovers strolled thro' the lanes, shy and diffident, each with each, Yet knit by some subtle union too fine for their halting speech: Humble lives, to low thought, and low; but linked, to the thinker's eye, By a bond that is stronger than death, with the lights of the ultimate sky: Here as there, the great drama of life rolled on, and a jubilant voice Thrilled through me ineffable, vast, and bade me exult and rejoice; Exult and rejoice, oh soul! sang my being to a mystical hymn As I passed by the cool bright wolds, as I threaded my pinewoods dim; Rejoice and be sure! as I passed to my fair home under the hill, Wrapt round with a happy content,‚Äîand the world and my soul were still! SONG. [Beam on me, fair Ideal, beam on me!] Beam on me, fair Ideal, beam on me! Too long thou hast concealed thee in a cloud; Mine is no vision strong to pierce to thee, Nor voice complaining loud, Whereby thou mightest find thy dear, and come To thine own heart, and long-expecting home. Too long thou dost withdraw thee from mine eyes; Too long thou lingerest. Ah, truant sweet! Dost thou no reckoning take of all my sighs, While Time with flying feet Speeds onward, till the westering sun sinks low‚Äî With cruel feet so swift and yet so slow? Time was I thought that thou wouldst come a maid White-armed, with deep blue eyes and sunny head; But, ah! too long the lovely vision stayed. And then, when this was fled, Fame, with blown clarion clear, and wide-spread wings, Fame, crown and summit of created things. And then in guise of Truth, when this grew faint, Truth in Belief, and Act, and Life and Thought, White-robed and virginal, a pure cold saint, Thou cam'st awhile, long sought; But only in glimpses camest thou, so I Watch wearily until thou passest by. I wait, I watch, I hunger, though I know Thou wilt not come at all who stay'st so long. My hope has lost its strength, my heart its glow; I grow too cold for song: Long since I might have sung, hadst thou come then, A song to echo through the souls of men. Yet, since 'tis better far to dream in sleep, Than wholly lose the treacheries of time, I hold it gain to have seen thy garments sweep On the far hills sublime: Still will I hope thy glorious face to see,‚Äî Beam on me, fair Ideal, beam on me! AT LAST. Let me at last be laid On that hillside I know which scans the vale, Beneath the thick yews' shade, For shelter when the rains and winds prevail. It cannot be the eye Is blinded when we die, So that we know no more at all The dawns increase, the evenings fall; Shut close within a mouldering chest of wood Asleep, and careless of our children's good. Shall I not feel the spring, The yearly resurrection of the earth, Stir thro' each sleeping thing With the fair throbbings and alarms of birth, Calling at its own hour On folded leaf and flower, Calling the lamb, the lark, the bee, Calling the crocus and anemone, Calling new lustre to the maiden's eye, And to the youth love and ambition high? Shall I no more admire The winding river kiss the daisied plain? Nor see the dawn's cold fire Steal downward from the rosy hills again? Nor watch the frowning cloud, Sublime with mutterings loud, Burst on the vale, nor eves of gold, Nor crescent moons, nor starlights cold, Nor the red casements glimmer on the hill At Yule-tides, when the frozen leas are still? Or should my children's tread Through Sabbath twilights, when the hymns are done, Come softly overhead, Shall no sweet quickening through my bosom run, Till all my soul exhale Into the primrose pale, And every flower which springs above Breathes a new perfume from my love; And I shall throb, and stir, and thrill beneath With a pure passion stronger far than death? Sweet thought! fair, gracious dream, Too fair and fleeting for our clearer view! How should our reason deem That those dear souls, who sleep beneath the blue In rayless caverns dim, 'Mid ocean monsters grim, Or whitening on the trackless sand, Or with strange corpses on each hand In battle-trench or city graveyard lie, Break not their prison-bonds till time shall die? Nay, 'tis not so indeed. With the last fluttering of the failing breath The clay-cold form doth breed A viewless essence, far too fine for death; And ere one voice can mourn, On upward pinions borne, They are hidden, they are hidden, in some thin air, Far from corruption, far from care, Where through a veil they view their former scene, Only a little touched by what has been. Touched but a little; and yet, Conscious of every change that doth befal, By constant change beset, The creatures of this tiny whirling ball, Filled with a higher being, Dowered with a clearer seeing, Risen to a vaster scheme of life, To wider joys and nobler strife, Viewing our little human hopes and fears As we our children's fleeting smiles and tears. Then, whether with fire they burn This dwelling-house of mine when I am fled, And in a marble urn My ashes rest by my belov√®d dead, Or in the sweet cold earth I pass from death to birth, And pay kind Nature's life-long debt In heart's-ease and in violet‚Äî In charnel-yard or hidden ocean wave, Where'er I lie, I shall not scorn my grave. SONG. [Love-sighs that are sighed and spent in vain] Love-sighs that are sighed and spent in vain, Ah! folly, folly, Thou dost transmute into a precious pain, Sweet melancholy. Ah! folly, folly, Ah! fair melancholy, Sweeter by far thy mild remedial pain, Than if fierce hope should rise and throb again. High hopes of glory sunk to naught, Ah! folly, folly, And deep perplexities of baffled thought Thou healest, melancholy. Ah! folly, folly, Ah! sweet melancholy, Thou dost bear with thee a balm unsought, To heal the wounds of love and pride and thought. Yet thou art a trivial cure for ill, Pale melancholy, Fitting best a feebler brain and will, Ah! folly, folly, Ay, sweet melancholy, Folly art thou, folly. Who only may not trivial ills endure Will to thy pharmacy entrust his cure. Since thou shalt not heal the wounds I know, Pale melancholy, I will seek if any comfort grow In jovial folly, Ah! folly, folly, Worse than melancholy, No other cure there is for Fortune's smart Than a soul self-contained, and a proud innocent heart! THE DIALOGUE. Unto my soul I said, ‚ÄúOh, vagrant soul! When o'er my living head A few years roll, Is't true that thou shalt fly Far away into the sky, Leaving me in my place Alone with my disgrace? ‚ÄúFor thou wilt stand in the East, The night withdrawn, White-robed as is a priest, At the door of dawn; While I within the ground, In misery fast bound, Shall lie, blind, deaf, and foul, Since thou art fled, O soul.‚Äù Then said my soul to me: ‚ÄúThy lot is best; For thou shalt tranquil be, Sunk deep in rest, While naked I shall know The intolerable glow When as, the sun, shall rise A fire in fiery skies. ‚ÄúThou shalt lie cool and dark, Forgetting all; I shall float shamed and stark, Till the sun fall: Thou shalt be earth in earth, Preparing for new birth; While me in the heavens fierce, Pure glories fright and pierce.‚Äù Then said I to my soul, And she to me: ‚ÄúWhere'er life's current roll We twain shall be, Part here and part not here, Partners in hope and fear, Until, our exile done, We meet at last in one.‚Äù THE BIRTH OF VERSE. Blind thoughts which occupy the brain, Dumb melodies which fill the ear, Dim perturbations, precious pain, A gleam of hope, a chill of fear,‚Äî These seize the poet's soul, and mould The ore of fancy into gold. And first no definite thought there is In all that affluence of sound, Like those sweet formless melodies Piped to the listening woods around, By birds which never teacher had But love and knowledge: they are glad. Till, when the chambers of the soul Are filled with inarticulate airs, A spirit comes which doth control The music, and its end prepares; And, with a power serene and strong, Shapes these wild melodies to song. Or haply, thoughts which glow and burn Await long time the fitting strain, Which, swiftly swelling, seems to turn The silence to a load of pain; And somewhat in him seems to cry, ‚ÄúI will have utterance, or I die!‚Äù Then of a sudden, full, complete, The strong strain bursting into sound, Words come with rhythmic rush of feet, Fit music girds the language round, And with a comeliness unsought, Appears the winged, embodied thought. But howsoever they may rise, Fit words and music come to birth; There soars an angel to the skies, There walks a Presence on the earth‚Äî A something which shall yet inspire Myriads of souls unborn with fire. And when his voice is hushed and dumb, The flame burnt out, the glory dead, He feels a thrill of wonder come At that which his poor tongue has said; And thinks of each diviner line‚Äî ‚ÄúOnly the hand that wrote was mine.‚Äù SONG. [Oh! were I rich and mighty] Oh! were I rich and mighty, With store of gems and gold, And you, a beggar at my gate, Lay starving in the cold; I wonder, could I bear To leave you pining there? Or, if I were an angel, And you an earth-born thing, Beseeching me to touch you In rising with my wing; I wonder should I soar Aloft, nor heed you more? Or, dear, if I were only A maiden cold and sweet, And you, a humble lover, Sighed vainly at my feet; I wonder if my heart Would know no pain or smart? THE ENIGMA. The gaslights flutter and flare On the cruel stones of the street, And beneath in the sordid glare Pace legions of weary feet; Fair faces that soon shall grow hard, Shy glances already grown bold, The wrecks of a girlhood marred By shame and hunger and cold. But here, as she passes along, Is one whose young cheek still shows, 'Mid the pallid, pitiful throng, The fresh bloom of a tender rose. Not long has she walked with vice, A recruit to the army of Ill, A fresh lamb for the sacrifice That steams up to Moloch still. And the spell through which youth draws all, The faint shyness in hurrying walk, The lithe form slender and tall, The soft burr in her simple talk, Constrains the grave passer, whose brain Is long leagues of fancy apart, To thrill with a sudden pain And an emptiness of heart. Poor child! since it is not long Since you were indeed but a child, A gay thing of bird-like song, And even as a bird is wild; With no shadow of thought or care, Laughing all the sweet hours away, When every morning was fair, And every season a May. Through the red fallow on the hill The white team laboured along, While you roamed the green copses at will, And mimicked the cuckoo's song; While they tossed and carried the hay, While the reapers were hid in the wheat, You had only to laugh and to play, Or to bathe in the brook your feet. For your mother left you a child, Your rough father's pride and joy: Rejoiced that his girl was as wild And fearless as any boy. Though you would not plunder the nest, Nor harry the shrieking hare, You could gallop bare-backed with the best, And knew where the orchises were. ‚ÄúLike a boy‚Äù was what they said, With your straight limbs and fearless face; Like a girl in the golden head, Gay fancies, and nameless grace. Like a boy in high courage and all Quick forces, and daring of will; Like a girl in the peril to fall, And innocent blindness to ill. And even now, on the sordid street, As you pass by the theatre door, You bring with you some freshness sweet Of the brightness and breezes of yore. Not yet are the frank eyes grown bold, Not yet have they lost all their joy; Not yet has time taken the gold From the short crisp curls of the boy. And if truly a boy's they were, Not thus would he pace forlorn; Nor would careless passers-by dare To shoot out the lips of scorn. Is it Nature or man that makes An unequal judgment arraign Those whose equal nature takes The mark of the self-same stain? Leaving this one, shame and disgrace; Leaving that one, honour and fame; To this one, confusion of face, To that one, a stainless name: A high port and respect and wealth For the one who is guilty indeed, While the innocent walks by stealth Through rough places with feet that bleed. Do I touch a deep ulcer of Time, A created or ultimate ill, A primal curse or a crime, Self-inflicted through ignorance still? But meanwhile, poor truant, you come With a new face year after year, Leaving innocence, freedom, and home For these dens of weeping and fear. To decline by a swift decay, To a thing so low and forlorn, That, for all your fresh beauty to-day, It were better you never were born; Or to find in some rare-sent hour, As a lily rooted in mire, Love spring with its pure white flower From the lowest depths of desire. Heaven pity you! So little turns The stream of our lives from the right; So like is the flame that burns To the hearth that gives warmth and light; So fine the impassable fence, Set for ever 'twixt right and wrong, Between white lives of innocence And dark lives too dreadful for song. TO THE TORMENTORS. Dear little friend, who, day by day, Before the door of home Art ready waiting till thy master come, With monitory paw and noise, Swelling to half delirious joys, Whether my path I take By leafy coverts known to the before, Where the gay coney loves to play, Or the loud pheasant whirls from out the brake Unharmed by us, save for some frolic chase, Or innocent panting race; Or who, if by the sunny river's side Haply my steps I turn, With loud petition constantly dost yearn To fetch the whirling stake from the warm tide; Who, if I chide the, grovellest in the dust, And dost forgive me, though I am unjust, Blessing the hand that smote: who with fond love Gazest, and fear for me, such as doth move Those finer souls which know, yet may not see, And are wrapped round and lost in ecstasy;‚Äî And thou, dear little friend and soft, Breathing a gentle air of hearth and home; Whose low purr to the lonely ear doth oft With deep refreshment come; Though thy quick nature is not frank and gay As that one's, yet with graceful play Thou dost beguile the evenings, and dost sit With mien demurely fit; With half-closed eyes, as in a dream Responsive to the singing steam, Most delicately clean and white, Thou baskest in the flickering light; Quick-tempered art thou, and yet, if a child Molest thee, pitiful and mild; And always thy delight is, simply neat, To seat thee faithful at thy master's feet;‚Äî And thou, good friend and strong, Who art the docile labourer of the world; Who groanest when the battle mists are curled On the red plain; who toilest all day long To make our gain or sport; who art the care That cleanses idle lives, which, but for thee And thy pure, noble nature, perhaps might sink To lower levels, born of lust and drink, And half-forgotten sloughs of infamy, Which desperate souls could dare;‚Äî And ye, fair timid things, who lightly play By summer woodlands at the close of day;‚Äî What are ye all, dear creatures, tame or wild? What other nature yours than of a child, Whose dumbness finds a voice mighty to call, In wordless pity, to the souls of all Whose lives I turn to profit, and whose mute And constant friendship links the man and brute? Shall I consent to raise A torturing hand against your few and evil days? Shall I indeed delight To take you, helpless kinsmen, fast and bound, And while ye lick my hand Lay bare your veins and nerves in one red wound, Divide the sentient brain; And while the raw flesh quivers with the pain, A calm observer stand, And drop in some keen acid, and watch it bite The writhing life: wrench the still beating heart, And with calm voice meanwhile discourse, and bland, To boys who jeer or sicken as they gaze, Of the great Goddess Science and her gracious ways? Great Heaven! this shall not be, this present hell, And none denounce it; well I know, too well, That Nature works by ruin and by wrong, Taking no care for any but the strong, Taking no care. But we are more than she; We touch to higher levels, a higher love Doth through our being move: Though we know all our benefits bought by blood, And that by suffering only reach we good; Yet not with mocking laughter, nor in play, Shall we give death or carve a life away. And if it be indeed For some vast gain of knowledge, we might give These humble lives that live, And for the race should bid the victim bleed, Only for some great gain, Some counterpoise of pain; And that with solemn soul and grave, Like his who from the fire 'scapes, or the flood, Who would save all, ay, with his heart's best blood, But of his children chooses which to save! Surely a man should scorn To owe his weal to others' death and pain? Sure 'twere no real gain To batten on lives so weak and so forlorn? Nor were it right indeed To do for others what for self were wrong. 'Tis but the same dead creed, Preaching the naked triumph of the strong; And for this Goddess Science, hard and stern, We shall not let her priests torment and burn: We fought the priests before, and not in vain; And as we fought before, so will we fight again. CHILDREN OF THE STREET. Bright boys vociferous, Girl-children clamorous, Shrill trebles echoing, Down the long street; Every day come they there, Afternoon foul or fair, Shouting and volleying; Through wintry winds and cold, Through summer eves of gold, Running and clamouring: Never a day but brings, Ragged and thinly clad, Battling with poverty, Hunger, and wretchedness, Brave little souls forlorn, Gaining hard bread. ‚ÄúTerrible accident; Frightful explosion, Sir; News from Australia, News from America; Only one halfpenny, Special edition, Sir, Echo, Sir, Echo!‚Äù Thus they shout breathlessly, Dashing and hurrying, Threading the carriages, Under the rapid feet; Frightening the passer-by, Down the long street: On till they chance to meet Some vague philosopher. And straightway the hurry, And bustle, and noise, Fade away in his thought Before tranquiller joys. Here are problems indeed, Not to solve, it is true, But on every side filling The fanciful view; Which ere he has grasped them Are vanished and gone, But leave him in solitude Never alone: Thoughts of Fate, and of Life, And the end of it all, Of the struggle and strife Where few rise, many fall; Thoughts of Country and Empire, Of Future and Past, And the centuries gliding So slow, yet so fast: Old fancies, yet strange, Thoughts sad and yet sweet, Of lives come to harvest, And lives incomplete; Of the lingering march, Of the Infinite plan, Bringing slowly, yet surely, The glory of man; Of our failures and losses, Our victory and gain; Of our treasure of hope And our Present of pain. And, higher than all, That these young voices teach A glowing conviction Too precious for speech; That somewhere down deep In each natural soul Sacred verities sleep, Holy waterfloods roll; That to young lives untaught, Without friend, without home, Some gleams of a light That is heavenlier come; That to toil which is honest A voice calls them still, Which is more than the tempter's And stronger than ill. For, poor souls, 'twere better, If pleasure were all, Not to strive thus and labour, But let themselves fall; They might gain, for a time, Higher wages than this, And that sharp zest of sinning The innocent miss; They might know fuller life, And, should fortune befriend, Escape the Law's pains From beginning to end; Or, if they should fail, What for them does home bring Which should make of a prison So dreadful a thing? These children, whom formalists, Narrow and stern, Have denied what high principle Comes from to learn; To whom this great empire, Whose records they cry, Is a book sealed as close As the ages gone by; Who bear a name great Among nations of earth, But are English alone By the fortune of birth; These young mouths that come To a board well-nigh bare, Who elsewhere were riches, But here a grave care. Great Empire! fast bound By invisible bands, That convey to earth's limits Thy rulers' commands; Who sittest alone By thy rude northern sea, On an ocean-built throne, The first home of the free, Whom thy tall chimneys shroud In a life-giving gloom; Who clothest mankind With the work of thy loom; Who o'er all seas dost send out Thy deep-laden ships; Who teachest all nations The words of thy lips; Who despatchest thy viceroys Imperially forth To the palms of thy East And the snows of thy North; Who governest millions Of dark subtle men By the might of just laws And the sword of the pen; Who art planted wherever A white foot may tread, On the poisonous land Which for ages lies dead; Who didst nourish the freeman With milk from thy breast, To the measureless Commonwealth Lording the West; Who holdest to-day Of those once subject lands A remnant too mighty For weaklier hands; Who in thy isle-continent, Yearly increased, Rearest empires of freemen To sway the far East; Who art set on lone islets Of palm and of spice, On deserts of sand And on mountains of ice; Who bring'st Freedom wherever Thy flag is unfurled: The exemplar, the envy, The crown of the World! What is't thou dost owe To these young lives of thine, What else but to foster This dim spark divine? Think of myriads like these, Without teaching or home, Who with pitiful accents Beseeching thee come; Think how Time, whirling on, Time that never may rest, Brings the strength of the loins And the curve of the breast, Till, with poor minds still childish, These children are grown To the age that shall give them Young lives of their own; Think of those, who to-day In the sweet country air Live, as soulless, almost, As the birds which they scare; Think of all those for whom, To the immature brain, The dull whirr of the loom Brings a throbbing of pain; Think of countless lives fallen, Sunk, never to rise, For the lack of the warning Their country denies,‚Äî Fallen, ruined, and lost, Through all time that shall be, Fallen for ever and lost To themselves and to thee;‚Äî Thou who standest, girt round By strong foes on each side, Foes who envy thy greatness, Thy glory, thy pride; Thou, who surely shalt need Heart and soul, brain and hand, Brain to plan, hand to bleed, For thy might, O dear land! Till, while slowly he ponders These thoughts in his brain, See! there swiftly comes rushing A young troop again. ‚ÄúTerrible accident; Frightful explosion, Sir; News, Sir, from Germany; Latest from India; Special edition, Sir; Only one half-penny!‚Äù Thus the revoluble Assonant Echo. Again they rush breathlessly; Dashing and hurrying, Frighting the passer-by, Shouting and volleying, Bright boys vociferous, Girl-children clamorous, On till they meet again Some vague philosopher. SOULS IN PRISON. I thought that I looked on the land of the lost, A stony desert, arid and bare, Gray under a heavy air. Not a bird was there, nor a flower, nor a tree, Nor rushing river, nor sounding sea; And I seemed to myself like a ghost. A land of shadows, a herbless plain, A faint light aslant on the barren ground, And never a sight nor a sound: Only at times, of invisible feet, Wearily tracking one dull, sad beat, Too spiritless to complain; And of faces hid by a blank white mask, From which there glared out cavernous eyes, Full of hate and revolt and lies: As if the green earth on which others live Had nothing of hope or of fear to give But a hopeless, perpetual task. Far in the distance a vast gray pile Stretched out its spider-like, echoing ways In long centrifugal rays; And sometimes dimly I seemed to see Dumb gangs of poor workers, fruitlessly Bent in hard tasks useless and vile, To which, issuing silent, in single rank, Along narrow pathways stony and blank The hopeless toilers would come. Or else each was idly cooped in a cell Narrow, and gloomy, and hard, as hell, Which was all that they knew of home. And around them frowning, grimy and tall, With no ivy or lichen, a circling wall Shut God and life utterly out; And in the midst, with unclosing eye, A muffled watcher stood silently, As they paced about and about. Never alone‚Äîfor, wherever they went, From some central tower an eye was bent Along all the long, straight-drawn ways. Never alone‚Äîfor an unseen eye, As the stealthy footstep went noiselessly by, Swept each lonely cell with its gaze. Always alone‚Äîfor in all the throng No word or glance as they shuffled along But the order-word, sharp and loud. Always alone‚Äîfor in all the crowd No glance of comfort from pitying eyes Might pierce through the thick disguise. Nor, if husband were there, or child, or wife, Could the subtle communion of love and life Escape that terrible eye. Yet husbands and wives and children there were, Young limbs, and age bent in a dumb despair, Too strong or too weak to die. Nothing remained, as it seemed, but thought Of the old hopes vanished and come to nought, And the hopeless, perpetual care,‚Äî Nought but to sit, as the night would fall, Tracing black ghosts on the blank white wall In a silent rage of despair; Or, before the dull daylight began to break, To start at the iron-tongued summons and wake To the curse of another day. And so, in silence, to brood and plot To regain the poor freedom and life which were not, Though it bartered a soul away; Or, later, to cherish the old offence With a secret lurking devil of sense, And a spring of desire self-bent, Till at last all longing was sunk and spent In a lifeless, fathomless slough of content. Not repentance, nor fear, nor grief, Nor belief at all, nor yet unbelief, But a soul which skulks from itself like a thief, And is damned for ever and dead. Thus I thought to myself; and, though straight I saw It was only the house of retributive Law, I shuddered and shrank, and fled. A SEPARATION DEED. Whereas we twain, who still are bound for life, Who took each other for better and for worse, Are now plunged deep in hate and bitter strife, And all our former love is grown a curse; So that 'twere better, doubtless, we should be In loneliness, so that we were apart, Nor in each other's changed eyes looking, see The cold reflection of an alien heart: To this insensate parchment we reveal Our joint despair, and seal it with our seal. Forgetting the dear days not long ago, When we walked slow by starlight through the corn: Forgetting, since our hard fate wills it so, All but our parted lives and souls forlorn; Forgetting the sweet fetters strong to bind Which childish fingers forge and baby smiles, Our common pride to watch the growing mind, Our common joy in childhood's simple wiles, The common tears we shed, the kiss we gave, Standing beside the open little grave; Forgetting these and more, if to forget Be possible, as we would fain indeed. And if the past be not too deeply set In our two hearts, with roots that touched, will bleed Yet, could we cheat by any pretext fair The world, if not ourselves‚Äî'twere so far well‚Äî We would not put our bonds from us, and bare To careless eyes the secrets of our hell; So this indenture witnesseth that we, As follows here, do solemnly agree. We will take each our own, and will abide Separate from bed and board for all our life; Whatever chance of weal or woe betide, Naught shall re-knit the husband and the wife. Though one grow gradually poor and weak, The other, lapt in luxury, will not heed; Though one, in mortal pain, the other seek, The other may not answer to the need; We, who through long years did together rest In wedlock, heart to heart, and breast to breast. One shall the daughter take, and one the boy,‚Äî Poor boy, who shall not hear his mother's name, Nor feel her kiss; poor girl, for whom the joy Of her sire's smile is changed for sullen shame: Brother and sister, who, if they should meet, With faces strange, amid the careless crowd, Will feel their hearts beat with no quicker beat, Nor inward voice of kinship calling loud: Two widowed lives, whose fulness may not come; Two orphan lives, knowing but half of home. We have not told the tale, nor will, indeed, Of dissonance, whether cruel wrong or crime, Or sum of petty injuries which breed The hate of hell when multiplied by time, Dishonour, falsehood, jealous fancies, blows, Which in one moment wedded souls can sunder; But, since our yoke intolerable grows, Therefore we set our seals and souls as under: Witness the powers of Wrong and Hate and Death. And this Indenture also witnesseth. SONG. [They mount from glory to glory] They mount from glory to glory, They sink from deep unto deep, They proclaim their sweet passionate story, They tremble on chords that weep, And with them my soul spreads her wings, And my heart goes out to them and sings. And chord within chord interlaces, Like the leaves that protect some fair bloom; And with subtle and tremulous graces, And tender lights dappled with gloom, Like the fall of an ocean-borne bell, The harmonies quicken and swell. Then swift from those languishing voices And accents which marry and die, Like the sound of a trumpet, rejoices One clear note unfaltering, high, And my soul, through its magical power, Bursts and dies like an aloe in flower. FREDERIC. As these sheets came in from the printer, My lad who had brought me them said, ‚ÄúPlease, Sir, as I passed his office, They told me that Frederic was dead.‚Äù And I knew in a moment thrill through me, A keen little sorrow and smart, Then a sudden revolt and rebellion Assail me and fetter my heart, As he went on with boyish prattle, Before I had courage to speak: ‚ÄúHe died of consumption, they said, Sir; And he earned sixteen shillings a week.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow old was he?‚Äù ‚ÄúJust seventeen, Sir: He had grown very tall and white.‚Äù And I thought of the childish features, The bright cheeks, and eyes still more bright, When, withdrawn from his school far too early, He came with his treasured prize, To show to his new-found master, With a simple pride in his eyes; And how it soon proved that his writing Was so clear, and skilful, and fine, That I set him the task to decipher The hieroglyphs which are mine. 'Twas four years ago, and so splendid Did my first book of songs appear, That, though ofttimes already rejected, I sent them forth then without fear. Nor in vain. For now many minds know them, And many are kindly in praise, But the cold little hand that adorned them Has cast up the sum of its days! Sixteen shillings! this pittance could purchase The flower of those boyish years! This could give to that humble ambition Dull entries, whose total is tears! Poor young life which was bursting to blossom, Which had borne its own fruitage one day, Had those budding years mingled together Slow labour with healthfuller play! Is it man that has done this, or rather, These dead blasts that blow, blow, blow, blow, Week by week, month by month, till beneath them Life withers and pulses beat slow? The dull winds that to-day are slaying Young and old with their poisonous breath, Which slew the rash singer who praised them, Not the less with a premature death. Is it man with bad laws and fools' customs, Pride, poverty, ignorant greed? Is it God making lives for His pleasure, Dooms these innocent victims to bleed? Great riddle which one day shall be clearer, Be our doubts with all reverence said; But a strong power constrained me to write them, When I heard little Frederic was dead. TO MY MOTHERLAND. Dear motherland, forgive me, if too long I hold the halting tribute of my song; Letting my wayward fancy idly roam Far, far from thee, my early home. There are some things too near, Too infinitely dear For speech; the old ancestral hearth, The hills, the vales that saw our birth, Are hallowed deep within the reverent breast: And who of these keeps silence, he is best. Yet would not I appear, Who have known many a brighter land and sea Since first my boyish footsteps went from thee, The less to hold thee dear; Or lose in newer beauties the immense First love for thee, O birth-land, which fulfils My inmost heart and soul,‚Äî Love for thy smiling and sequestered vales, Love for thy winding streams which sparkling roll Through thy rich fields, dear Wales, From long perspectives of thy folded hills. Ay! these are sacred, all; I cannot sing of them, too near they are. What if from out thy dark yews, gazing far, I sat and sang, Llangunnor! of the vale Through which fair Towy winds her lingering fall, Gliding by Dynevor's wood-crowned steep, And, alternating swift with deep, By park and tower a living thing Of loveliness meandering; And traced her flowing, onward still, By Grongar dear to rhyme, or Drysllwyn's castled hill, Till the fresh upward tides prevail, Which stay her stream and bring the sea-borne sail, And the broad river rolls majestic down Beneath the gray walls of my native town. Would not my fancy quickly stray To thee, sea-girt St. David's, far away, A minster on the deep; or, further still, To you, grand mountains, which the stranger knows: Eryri throned amid the clouds and snows, The dark lakes, the wild passes of the north; Or Cader, a stern sentinel looking forth Over the boisterous main; or thee, dear Isle Not lovely, yet which canst my thought beguile‚Äî Mona, from whose fresh wind-swept pastures came My grandsire, bard and patriot, like in name Whose verse his countrymen still love to sing At bidding-feast or rustic junketing? Ah, no! too near for song, and ye too near, My brethren of the ancient race and tongue; The bardic measures deep, the sweet songs sung At congresses, which fan the sacred fire Which did of old your ancestors inspire; The simple worship sternly pure, The faith unquestioning and sure, Which doth the priest despise and his dark ways, And riseth best to fullest praise Beneath some humble roof-tree, rude and bare, Or through the mountains' unpolluted air; Who know not violence nor blood, And who, if sometimes ye decline from good, Sin the soft sins which gentler spirits move, Which warmer Fancy breeds, and too much love. I may not sing of you, Or tell my love‚Äîothers there are who will, Who haply bear not yet a love so true As that my soul doth fill‚Äî If to applause it lead, or gain, or fame; Better than this it were to bear the pain Which comes to higher spirits when they know They fire in other souls no answering glow; Love those who love me not again, And leave my country naught, not even a name. THE EPIC OF HADES. BOOK I. TARTARUS. In February, when the dawn was slow, And winds lay still, I gazed upon the fields Which stretched before me, lifeless, and the stream Which laboured in the distance to the sea, Sullen and cold. No force of fancy took My thought to bloomy June, when all the land Lay deep in crested grass, and through the dew The landrail brushed, and the lush banks were lit With strawberries, and the hot noise of bees Wooed the chaste flowers. Rather I seemed to move Thro' that weird land, Hellenic fancy feigned, Beyond the fabled river and the bark Of Charon; and forthwith on every side Rose the thin throng of ghosts. First thro' the gloom Of a dark grove I strayed‚Äîa sluggish wood, Where scarce the faint fires of the setting stars, Or some cold gleam of half-discovered dawn, Might pierce the darkling pines. A twilight drear Brooded o'er all the depths, and filled the dank And sunken hollows of the rocks with shapes Of terror,‚Äîbeckoning hands and noiseless feet Flitting from shade to shade, wide eyes that stared With horror, and dumb mouths which seemed to cry, Yet cried not. An ineffable despair Hung over them and that dark world and took The gazer captive, and a mingled pang Of grief and anger, grown to fierce revolt And hatred of the Invisible Force which holds The issue of our lives and binds us fast Within the net of Fate; as the fisher takes The little quivering sea-things from the sea And flings them gasping on the beach to die Then spreads his net for more. And then again I knew myself and those, creatures who lie Safe in the strong grasp of Unchanging Law, Encompassed round by hands unseen, and chains Which do support the feeble life that else Were spent on barren space; and thus I came To look with less of horror, more of thought, And bore to see the sight of pain that yet Should grow to healing, when the concrete stain Of life and act were purged, and the cleansed soul, Renewed by the slow wear and waste of time, Soared after √¶ons of days. They seemed alone, Those prisoners, thro' all time. Each soul shut fast In its own jail of woe, apart, alone, For evermore alone; no thought of kin, Or kindly human glance, or fellowship Of suffering or of sin, made light the load Of solitary pain. Ay, though they walked Together, or were prisoned in one cell With the partners of their wrong, or with strange souls Which the same Furies tore, they knew them not, But suffered still alone; as in that shape Of hell, fools build on earth, where hopeless sin Rots slow in solitude, nor sees the face Of men, nor hears the sound of speech, nor feels The touch of human hand, but broods a ghost, Hating the bare blank cell‚Äîthe other self, Which brought it thither‚Äîhating man and God, And all that is or has been. A great fear And pity froze my blood, who seemed to see A half-remembered form. An Eastern King It was who lay in pain. He wore a crown Upon his aching brow, and his white robe Was jewelled with fair gems of price, the signs Of pomp and honour and all luxury, Which might prevent desire. But as I looked There came a hunger in the gloating eyes, A quenchless thirst upon the parching lips, And such despairing strainings in the hands Stretched idly forth on what I could not see, Some fatal food of fancy; that I knew The undying worm of sense, which frets and gnaws The unsatisfied stained soul. Seeing me, he said: ‚ÄúWhat? And art thou too damned as I? Dost know This thirst as I, and see as I the cool Lymph drawn from thee and mock thy lips; and parch For ever in continual thirst; and mark The fair fruit offered to thy hunger fade Before thy longing eyes? I thought there was No other as I thro' all the weary lengths Of Time the gods have made, who pined so long And found fruition mock him. Long ago, When I was young on earth, 'twas a sweet pain To ride all day in the long chase, and feel Toil and the summer fire my blood and parch My lips, while in my father's halls I knew The cool bath waited, with its marble floor; And juices from the ripe fruits pressed, and chilled With snows from far-off peaks; and troops of slaves; And music and the dance; and fair young forms, And dalliance, and every joy of sense, That haunts the dreams of youth, which strength and ease Corrupt, and vacant hours. Ay, it was sweet For a while to plunge in these, as fair boys plunge Naked in summer streams, all veil of shame Laid by, only the young dear body bathed And sunk in its delight, while the firm earth, The soft green pastures gay with innocent flowers, Or sober harvest fields, show like a dream; And nought is left, but the young life which floats Upon the depths of death, to sink, maybe, And drown in pleasure, or rise at length grown wise And gain the abandoned shore. Ah, but at last The swift desire burns stronger and more strong, And feeding on itself, grows tyrannous; And the parched soul no longer finds delight In the cool stream of old; nay, this itself, Smitten by the fire of sense as by a flame, Holds not its coolness more; and fevered limbs, Seeking the fresh tides of their youth, may find No more refreshment, but a cauldron fired With the fires of nether hell; and a black rage Usurps the soul, and drives it on to slake Its thirst with crime and blood. Longing Desire! Unsatisfied, sick, impotent Desire! Oh, I have known it ages long. I knew Its pain on earth ere yet my life had grown To its full stature, thro' the weary years Of manhood, nay, in age itself; I knew The selfsame weary thirst, unsatisfied By all the charms of sense, by wealth and power And homage; always craving, never quenched‚Äî The undying curse of the soul! The ministers And agents of my will drave far and wide Over all lands and seas, seeking to find Fresh pleasures for me, who had spent my sum Of pleasure, and had power, not even in thought, Nor faculty to enjoy. They tore apart The sacred claustral doors of home for me, Defiled the inviolate hearth for me, laid waste The flower of humble lives, in hope to heal The sickly fancies of the King, till rose A cry of pain from all the land; and I Grew happier for it, since I held the power To quench desire in blood. But even thus The old pain faded not, but swift again Revived; and thro' the sensual dull lengths Of my seraglios I stalked, and marked The glitter of the gems, the precious webs Plundered from every clime by cruel wars That strewed the sands with corpses; lovely eyes That looked no look of love, and fired no more Thoughts of the flesh; rich meats, and fruits, and wines Grown flat and savourless; and loathed them all, And only cared for power; content to shed Rivers of innocent blood, if only thus I might appease my thirst. Until I grew A monster gloating over blood and pain. Ah, weary, weary days, when every sense Was satisfied, and nothing left to slake The parched unhappy soul, except to watch The writhing limbs and mark the slow blood drip, Drop after drop, as the life ebbed with it; In a new thrill of lust, till blood itself Palled on me, and I knew the fiend I was, Yet cared not‚ÄîI who was, brief years ago, Only a careless boy lapt round with ease, Stretched by the soft and stealing tide of sense Which now grew red; nor ever dreamed at all What Furies lurked beneath it, but had shrunk In indolent horror from the sight of tears And misery, and felt my inmost soul Sicken with the thought of blood. There comes a time When the insatiate brute within the man, Weary with wallowing in the mire, leaps forth Devouring, and the cloven satyr-hoof Grows to the rending claw, and the lewd leer To the horrible fanged snarl, and the soul sinks And leaves the man a devil, all his sin Grown savourless, and yet he longs to sin And longs in vain for ever. Yet, methinks, It was not for the gods to leave me thus. I stinted not their worship, building shrines To all of them; the Goddess of Love I served With hecatombs, letting the fragrant fumes Of incense and the costly steam ascend From victims year by year; nay, my own son Pelops, my best beloved, I gave to them Offering, as he must offer who would gain The great gods' grace, my dearest. I had gained Through long and weary orgies that strange sense Of nothingness and wasted days which blights The exhausted life, bearing upon its front Counterfeit knowledge, when the bitter ash Of Evil, which the sick soul loathes, appears Like the pure fruit of Wisdom. I had grown As wizards seem, who mingle sensual rites And forms impure with murderous spells and dark Enchantments; till the simple people held My very weakness wisdom, and believed That in my blood-stained palace-halls, withdrawn, I kept the inner mysteries of Zeus And knew the secret of all Being; who was A sick and impotent wretch, so sick, so tired, That even bloodshed palled. For my stained soul, Knowing its sin, hastened to purge itself With every rite and charm which the dark lore Of priestcraft offered to it. Spells obscene, The blood of innocent babes, sorceries foul Muttered at midnight‚Äîthese could occupy My weary days; till all my people shrank To see me, and the mother clasped her child Who heard the monster pass. They would not hear, They listened not‚Äîthe cold ungrateful gods‚Äî For all my supplications; nay, the more I sought them were they hidden. At the last A dark voice whispered nightly: ‚ÄòThou, poor wretch, That art so sick and impotent, thyself The source of all thy misery, the great gods Ask a more precious gift and excellent Than alien victims which thou prizest not And givest without a pang. But shouldst thou take Thy costliest and fairest offering, 'Twere otherwise. The life which thou hast given Thou mayst recall. Go, offer at the shrine Thy best belov√®d Pelops, and appease Zeus and the averted gods, and know again The youth and joy of yore.‚Äô Night after night, While all the halls were still, and the cold stars Were fading into dawn, I lay awake Distraught with warring thoughts, my throbbing brain Filled with that dreadful voice. I had not shrunk From blood, but this, the strong son of my youth‚Äî How should I dare this thing? And all day long I would steal from sight of him and men, and fight Against the dreadful thought, until the voice Seared all my burning brain, and clamoured, ‚ÄòKill! Zeus bids thee, and be happy.‚Äô Then I rose At midnight, when the halls were still, and raised The arras, and stole soft to where my son Lay sleeping. For one moment on his face And stalwart limbs I gazed, and marked the rise And fall of his young breast, and the soft plume Which drooped upon his brow, and felt a thrill Of yearning; but the cold voice urging me Burned me like fire. Three times I gazed and turned Irresolute, till last it thundered at me, ‚ÄòStrike, fool! thou art in hell; strike, fool! and lose The burden of thy chains.‚Äô Then with slow step I crept as creeps the tiger on the deer, Raised high my arm, shut close my eyes, and plunged My dagger in his heart. And then, with a flash, The veil fell downward from my life and left Myself to me‚Äîthe daily sum of sense‚Äî The long continual trouble of desire‚Äî The stain of blood blotting the stain of lust‚Äî The weary foulness of my days, which wrecked My heart and brain, and left me at the last A madman and accurs√®d; and I knew, Far higher than the sensual slope which held The gods whom erst I worshipped, a white peak Of Purity, and a stern voice pealing doom‚Äî Not the mad voice of old‚Äîwhich pierced so deep Within my life, that with the reeking blade Wet with the heart's blood of my child I smote My guilty heart in twain. Ah! fool, to dream That the long stain of time might fade and merge In one poor chrism of blood. They taught of yore, My priests who flattered me‚Äînor knew at all The greater God I know, who sits afar Beyond those earthly shapes, passionless, pure, And awful as the Dawn‚Äîthat the gods cared For costly victims, drinking in the steam Of sacrifice when the choice hecatombs Were offered for my wrong. Ah no! there is No recompense in these, nor any charm To cleanse the stain of sin, but the long wear Of suffering, when the soul which seized too much Of pleasure here, grows righteous by the pain That doth redress its ill. For what is Right But equipoise of Nature, alternating The Too Much and Too Little? Not on earth The salutary silent forces work Their final victory, but year on year Passes, and age on age, and leaves the debt Unsatisfied, while the o'erburdened soul Unloads itself in pain. Therefore it is I suffer as I suffered ere swift death Set me not free, no otherwise; and yet There comes a healing purpose in my pain I never knew on earth; nor ever here The once-loved evil grows, only the tale Of penalties grown greater hourly dwarfs The accomplished sum of wrong. And yet desire Pursues me still‚Äîsick, impotent desire, Fiercer than that of earth. We are ourselves Our heaven and hell, the joy, the penalty, The yearning, the fruition. Earth is hell Or heaven, and yet not only earth; but still, After the swift soul leaves the gates of death, The pain grows deeper and less mixed, the joy Purer and less alloyed, and we are damned Or blest, as we have lived.‚Äù He ceased, with a wail Like some complaining wind among the pines Or pent among the fretful ocean caves, A sick, sad sound. Then as I looked, I saw His eyes glare horribly, his dry parched lips Open, his weary hands stretch idly forth As if to clutch the air‚Äîinfinite pain And mockery of hope. ‚ÄúSeest thou them now?‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúI thirst, I parch, I famish, yet They still elude me, fair and tempting fruit And cooling waters. Now they come again. See, they are in my grasp, they are at my lips, Now I shall quench me. Nay, again they fly And mock me. Seest thou them, or am I shut From hope for ever, hungering, thirsting still, A madman and in Hell?‚Äù And as I passed In horror, his large eyes and straining hands Froze all my soul with pity. Then it was A woman whom I saw: a dark pale Queen, With passion in her eyes, and fear and pain Holding her steadfast gaze, like one who sees Some dreadful deed of wrong worked out and knows Himself the cause, yet now is powerless To stay the wrong he would. Seeing me gaze In pity on her woe, she turned and spake With a low wailing voice‚Äî ‚ÄúThou well mayst gaze With horror on me, sir, for I am lost; I have shed the innocent blood, long years ago, Nay, centuries of pain. I have shed the blood Of him I loved, and found for recompense But self-inflicted death and age-long woe, Which purges not my sin. And yet not I It was who did it, but the gods, who took A woman's loveless heart and tortured it With love as with a fire. It was not I Who slew my love, but Fate. Fate 'twas which brought My love and me together, Fate which barred The path of blameless love, yet set Love's flame To burn and smoulder in a hopeless heart, Where no relief might come. The King was old, And I a girl. 'Tis an old tale which runs Thro' the sad ages, and 'twas mine. He had spent His sum of love long since, and I‚ÄîI knew not A breath of Love as yet. Ah, it is strange To lose the sense of maidenhood, drink deep Of life to the very dregs, and yet not know A flutter of Love's wing. Love takes no thought For pomp, or palace, or respect of men; Nor always in the stately marriage bed, Closed round by silken curtains, laid on down, Nestles a rosy form; but 'mid wild flowers Or desert tents, or in the hind's low cot, Beneath the aspect of the unconscious stars, Dwells all night and is blest. My love, my life! He was the old man's son, a fair white soul‚Äî Not like the others, whom the fire of youth Burns like a flame and hurries unrestrained Thro' riotous days and nights, but virginal And pure as any maid. No careless glance He deigned for all the maidens young and fair Who sought their Prince's eye. But evermore, On the high pastures wandering alone, He dwelt unwed; weaving to Artemis, Fairest of all Olympian maids, a wreath From the unpolluted meads, where never herd Drives his white flock, nor ever scythe has come, But the bee sails upon unfettered wing Over the spring-like lawns, and Purity Waters them with soft dews; Euripides, ‚ÄúHippolytus,‚Äù lines 70-78. and yet he showed Of all his peers most manly‚Äîheart and soul A very man, tender and true, and strong And pitiful, and in his limbs and mien Fair as Apollo's self. It was at first In Tr≈ìzen that I saw him, when he came To greet his sire. Amid the crowd of youths He showed a Prince indeed; yet knew I not Whom 'twas I saw, nor that I held the place Which was his mother's, only from the throng Love, with a barbed dart aiming, pierced my heart Ere yet I knew what ailed me. Every glance Fired me; the youthful grace, the tall straight limbs, The swelling sinewy arms, the large dark eyes Tender yet full of passion, the thick locks Tossed from his brow, the lip and cheek which bore The down of early manhood, seemed to feed My heart with short-lived joy. For when he stood Forth from the throng and knelt before his sire, Then raised his gaze to mine, I felt the curse Of Aphrodit√© burn me, as it burned My mother before me, and I dared not meet His innocent, frank young eyes. Said I then young? Ay, but not young as mine. But I had known The secret things of life, which age the soul In a moment, writing on its front their mark ‚ÄòToo early ripe;‚Äô and he was innocent, My spouse in fitted years, within whose arms I had defied the world. I turned away Like some white bird that leaves the flock, which sails High in mid air above the haunts of men, Feeling some little dart within her breast, Not death, but like to death, and slowly sinks Down to the earth alone, and bears her hurt Unseen, by herbless sand and bitter pool, And pines until the end. Even from that day I strove to gain his love. Nay, 'twas not I, But the cruel gods who drove me. Day by day We were together; for in days of old Women were free, not pent in gilded jails As afterwards, but free to walk alone, For good or evil, free. I hardly took Thought for my spouse, the King. For I had found My love at last: what matter if it were A guilty love? Yet love is love indeed, Stronger than heaven or hell. Day after day I set myself to tempt him from his proud And innocent way, for I had spurned aside Care for the gods or men‚Äîall but my love. What need to tell the tale? Was it a sigh, A blush, a momentary glance, which brought Assurance of my triumph? It is long Since I have lived, I cannot tell; I know Only the penalty of death and hell Which followed on my sin. I knew he loved. It was not wonderful, seeing that we dwelt A boy and girl together. I was fair, And Eros fired my eyes and lent my voice His own soft tremulous tones. But when our souls Trembled upon the verge, and fancy feigned His arms around me as we fled alone To some free land of exile, came a scroll; ‚ÄòDearest, it may not be; I fear the Gods; We dare not do this wrong. I go from hence And see thy face no more. Farewell! Forget The love we may not own; go, seek for both Forgiveness from the gods.‚Äô When I read the words, The cruel words, methought my heart stood still, And when the ebbing life returned I seemed To have lost all thought of Love. Only Revenge Dwelt with me still, the fiercer that I knew My long-prized hope, which came so near success, Snatched from me and for ever. When I rose From my deep swoon, I bade a messenger Go, seek the King for me. He came and sate Beside my couch, and all the doors were closed, And all withdrawn. Then with the liar's art, And hypocrite tears, and feigned reluctancy, And all the subtle wiles a woman draws From the armoury of hate, I did instil The poison on his soul. Cunning devices, False grief, false anger with his son, regrets, And half confessions‚Äîthese, with hateful skill Confused together, drove the old man's brain To frenzy; and I watched him, with a sneer, Turn to a dotard thirsting for the life Of his own child. But how to do the deed, Yet shed no blood, nor know the people's hate, Who loved the Prince, I knew not. Till one day The old man, looking out upon the sea, Besought the dread Poseidon to avenge The treachery of his son. And as we stood Gazing upon the breathless blue, a cloud Rose from the deep, a little fleecy cloud, Which sudden grew and grew, and turned the blue To purple; and a keen wind rose and sang Higher and higher, and the wine-dark sea Grew ruffled, and within the circling bay The tiny ripples, stealing up the sand, Plunged loud with manes of foam, until they swelled To misty surges thundering on the shore. Then at the old man's elbow as I stood, A deep dark thought, sent by the powers of ill, Answering, as now I know, my own black hate And not my poor dupe's anger, fired my soul And bade me speak. ‚ÄòThe god has heard thy prayer,‚Äô I whispered; ‚ÄòSee the surge which wakes and swells To fury; well I know what things shall be. It is Poseidon's voice sounds in the storm And sends thy vengeance. Young Hippolytus Loves, as thou knowest, on the yellow sand, Hard by the rippled margin of the wave, To urge his flying steeds. Bid him go forth‚Äî He will obey‚Äîand see what recompense The god will send his wrong. In the old man's eyes A watery gleam of malice played awhile‚Äî I hate him for it‚Äîand he bade his son, Yoking his three young fiery colts, drive forth His chariot on the sand. And still the storm Blew fiercer and more fierce, and the white crests Plunged on the strand, and the loud promontories Thundered back repercussive, and a mist Of foam, torn landward, hid the sounding shore. Then saw I him come forth and bid them yoke His untamed colts. I had not seen his face Since that last day, but seeing him, I felt The old love spring anew, yet mixed with hate‚Äî A storm of warring passions. Tho' I knew What end should come, yet would I speak no word That might avert it. The old man looked forth; I think he had well-nigh forgotten all The wrong he fancied and the doom he prayed, All but the father's pride in the strong son, Who was so young and bold. I saw a smile Upon the dotard's face, when now the steeds Were harnessed and the chariot, on the sand Along the circling margin of the bay, Flew, swift as light. A sudden gleam of sun Flashed on the silver harness as it went, Burned on the brazen axles of the wheels, And on the golden fillets of the Prince Doubled the gold. Sometimes a larger wave Would dash in mist around him, and in fear The rearing coursers plunged, and then again The strong young arm constrained them, and they flashed To where the wave-worn foreland ends the bay. And then he turned his chariot, a bright speck Now seen, now hidden, but always, tho' the surge Broke round it, safe; emerging like a star From the white clouds of foam. And as I watched, Speaking no word, and breathing scarce a breath, I saw the firm limbs strongly set apart Upon the chariot, and the reins held high, And the proud head bent forward, with long locks Streaming behind, as nearer and more near The swift team rushed‚Äîuntil, with a half joy, It seemed as if my love might yet elude The slow sure anger of the god, dull wrath Swayed by a woman's lie. But on the verge, As I cast my eyes, a vast and purple wall Swelled swiftly towards the land; the lesser waves Sank as it came, and to its toppling crest The spume-flecked waters, from the strand drawn back, Left dry the yellow shore. Onward it came, Hoarse, capped with breaking foam, lurid, immense, Rearing its dreadful height. The chariot sped Nearer and nearer. I could see my love With the light of victory in his eyes, the smile Of daring on his lips: so near he came To where the marble palace-wall confined The narrow strip of beach‚Äîhis brave young eyes Fixed steadfast on the goal, in the pride of life, Without a thought of death. I strove to cry, But terror choked my breath. Then, like a bull Upon the windy level of the plain Lashing himself to rage, the furious wave, Poising itself a moment, tossing high Its bristling crest dashed downward on the strand. With a stamp, with a rush, with a roar. And when I looked, The shore, the fields, the plain, were one white sea Of churning, seething foam‚Äîchariot and steeds Gone, and my darling on the wild mad surge Tossed high, whirled down, beaten, and bruised, and flung, Dying upon the marble. My great love Sprang up redoubled, and cast out my hate And spurned all thought of fear; and down the stair I hurried, and upon the bleeding form I threw myself, and raised his head, and clasped His body to mine, and kissed him on the lips, And in his dying ear confessed my wrong, And saw the horror in his dying eyes And knew that I was damned. And when he breathed His last pure breath, I rose and slowly spake‚Äî Turned to a Fury now by love and pain‚Äî To the old man who knelt, while all the throng Could hear my secret: ‚ÄòSee, thou fool, I am The murderess of thy son, and thou my dupe, Thou and thy gods. See, he was innocent; I murdered him for love. I scorn ye all, Thee and thy gods together, who are deceived By a woman's lying tongue! Oh, doting fool, To hate thy own! And ye, false powers, which punish The innocent, and let the guilty soul Escape unscathed, I hate ye all‚ÄîI curse, I loathe you!‚Äô Then I stooped and kissed my love, And left them in amaze; and up the stair Swept slowly to my chamber, and therein, Hating my life and cursing men and gods, I did myself to death. But even here, I find my punishment. Oh, terrible doom Of souls like mine! To see their evil done Always before their eyes, the one dread scene Of horror. See, the wild wave on the verge Towers horrible, and he‚Äî Oh, Love, my Love! Safety is near! quick! quicker! urge them on! Thou wilt 'scape it yet!‚ÄîNay, nay, it bursts on him! I have shed the innocent blood! Oh, dreadful gaze Within his glazing eyes! Hide them, ye gods! Hide them! I cannot bear them. Quick! a dagger! I will lose their glare in death. Nay, die I cannot; I must endure and live‚ÄîDeath brings not peace To the lost souls in Hell.‚Äù And her eyes stared, Rounded with horror, and she stooped and peered So eagerly, and pressed her fevered hands Upon her trembling forehead with such pain As drives the gazer mad. Then as I passed, I marked against the hardly dawning sky A toilsome figure standing, bent and strained, Before a rocky mass, which with great pain And agony of labour it would thrust Up a steep hill. But when upon the crest It poised a moment, then I held my breath With dread, for, lo! the poor feet seemed to clutch The hillside as in fear, and the poor hands With hopeless fingers pressed into the stone In agony, and the limbs stiffened, and a cry Like some strong swimmer's, whom the mightier stream Sweeps downward, and he sees his children's eyes Upon the bank, broke from him; and at last, After long wrestlings with despair, the limbs Relaxed, and as I closed my fearful eyes, Seeing the inevitable doom‚Äîa crash, A horrible thunderous noise, as down the steep The shameless fragment leapt. From crag to crag It bounded ever swifter, flashing fire And wreathed with smoke, as to the lowest depths Of the vale it tore, and seemed to take with it The miserable form whose hopeless eyes I caught, as with the great rock whirled and dashed Downward, and marking every crag with gore And long gray hairs, it plunged, yet living still, To the black hollow; and then a silence came More dreadful than the noise, and a low groan Was all that I could hear. When to the foot Of the dark steep I hurried, half in hope To find the victim dead‚Äînot recognizing The undying life of Hell‚ÄîI seemed to see An aged man, bruised, bleeding, with gray hairs, And eyes from which the cunning leer of greed Was scarcely yet gone out. A crafty voice It was that answered me, the voice of guile Part purified by pain: ‚ÄúThere comes not death To those who live in Hell, nor hardly pause Of suffering longer than may serve to make The pain renewed, more piercing. Long ago, I thought that I had cheated Death, and now I seek him; but he comes not, nor know I If ever he will hear me. Whence art thou? Comest thou from earthly air, or whence? What power Has brought thee hither? For I know indeed Thou art not lost as I; for never here I look upon a human face, nor see The ghosts who doubtless here on every side Suffer a common pain, only at times I hear the echo of a shriek far off, Like some faint ghost of woe which fills the pause And interval of suffering; but from whom The voice may come, or whence, I know not, only The air teems with vague pain, which doth distract The ear when for a moment comes surcease Of agony, and the sense of effort spent In vain and fruitless labour, and the pang Of long-deferred defeat, which waits and takes The world-worn heart, and maddens it when all‚Äî Heaven, conscience, happiness, are staked and lost For gains which still elude it. Yet 'twas sweet, A King in early youth, when pleasure is sweet, To live the fair successful years, and know The envy and respect of men. I cared For none of youth's delights: the dance, the song, Allured me not; the smooth soft ways of sense Tempted me not at all. I could despise The follies that I shared not, spending all The long laborious days in toilsome schemes To compass honour and wealth, and, as I grew In name and fame, finding my hoarded gains Transmuted into Power. The seas were white With laden argosies, and all were mine. The sheltering moles defied the wintry storms, And all were mine. The marble aqueducts, The costly bridges, all were mine. Fair roads Wound round and round the hills‚Äîmy work. The gods Alone I heeded not, nor cared at all For aught but that my eyes and ears might take, Spurning invisible things, nor built I to them Temple or shrine, wrapt up in life, set round With earthly blessings like a god. I rose To such excess of weal and fame and pride, My people held me god-like. I grew drunk With too great power, scoffing at men and gods, Careless of both, but not averse to fling To those too weak themselves, what benefits My larger wisdom spurned. Then suddenly I knew the pain of failure. Summer storms Sucked down my fleets even within sight of port. A grievous blight wasted the harvest-fields, Mocking my hopes of gain. Wars came and drained My store, and I grew needy, knowing now The hell of stronger souls, the loss of power Wherein they exulted once. There comes no pain Deeper than to have known delight of power, And then to lose it all. But I, I would not Sit tame beneath defeat, trimming my sails To wait the breeze of Fortune‚Äîfickle breath Which perhaps might breathe no more‚Äîbut chose instead By rash conceit and bolder enterprise To win her aid again. I had no thought Of selfish gain, only to be and act As a god to those, feeding my sum of pride With acted good. But evermore defeat Dogged me, and more and more my people grew To doubt me, seeing not the wealth, the force, Which once they worshipped. Then the lust of power Loved, not for sake of others, but itself, Grew on me, and the pride which can dare all, Save failure only, seized me. Evil finds Its ready chance. There were rich argosies Upon the seas: I sank them, ship and crew, In the unbetraying ocean. Wayfarers Crossing the passes with rich merchandise My creatures, hid behind the crags, o'erwhelined With rocks hurled downward. Yet I spent my gains For the public weal, not otherwise; and they, The careless people, took the piteous spoils Which cost the lives of many, and a man's soul, And blessed the giver. Empty venal blessings, Which sting more deep than curses! For awhile I was content with this, but at the last A great contempt and hatred of them took me, The base, vile churls! Why should I stain my soul For such as those‚Äîdogs that would fawn and lick The hand that fed them, but, if food should fail, Would turn and rend me? I would none of them; I would grow rich and happy, being indeed Godlike in brain to such. So with all craft, And guile, and violence I enriched me, loading My treasuries with gold. My deep-laid schemes Of gain engrossed the long laborious days, Stretched far into the night. Enjoy, I might not, Seeing it was all to do, and life so brief That ere a man might gain the goal he would, Lo! Age, and with it Death, and so an end! For all the tales of the indignant gods, What were they but the priests'? I had myself Broken all oaths; long time deceived and ruined With every phase of fraud the pious fools Whom oath-sworn Justice bound; battened on blood; And what was I the worse? How should the gods Bear rule if I were happy? Death alone Was certain. Therefore must I haste to heap Treasure sufficient for my need, and then Enjoy the gathered good. But gradually There came‚Äînot great disasters which might crush All hope, but petty checks which did decrease My store, and left my labour vain, and me Unwilling to enjoy; and gradually I felt the chill approach of age, which stole Higher and higher on me, till the life, As in a paralytic, left my limbs And heart, and mounted upwards to my brain, Its last resort, and rested there awhile Ere it should spread its wings. But even thus, Tho' powerless to enjoy, the insatiate greed And thirst of power sustained me, and supplied Life's spark with some scant fuel, till it seemed, Year after year, as if I could not die, Holding so fast to life. I grew so old That all the comrades of my youth, my prime, My age, were gone, and I was left alone With those who knew me not, bereft of all Except my master passion‚Äîan old man Forlorn, forgotten of the gods and Death. Yet all the people, seeing me grow old And prosperous, held me wise, and spread abroad Strange fables, growing day by day more strange‚Äî How I deceived the very gods. They thought That I was blest, remembering not the wear Of anxious thought, the growing sum of pain, The failing ear and eye, the slower limbs, Whose briefer name is Age: and yet I trow I was not all unhappy, though I knew It was too late to enjoy, and though my store Increased not as my greed‚Äînay, even sunk down A little, year by year. Till, last of all, When now my time was come and I had grown A little tired of living, a trivial hurt Laid me upon my bed; and as I mused On my long life and all its villanies, The wickedness I did, the blood I shed, The guile, the frauds of years‚Äîthey came with news, One now, and now another; how my schemes Were crushed, my enterprises lost, my toil And labour all in vain. Day after day They brought these tidings, while I longed to rise And stay the tide of ill, and raved to know I could not. At the last the added sum Of evil, like yon great rock poised awhile Uncertain, gathered into one, o'erwhelmed My feeble strength, and left me ruined and lost, And showed me all I was, and all the depth And folly of my sin, and racked my brain, And sank me in despair and misery, And broke my heart and slew me. Therefore 'tis I spend the long, long centuries which have come Between me and my sin, in such dread tasks As that thou sawest. In the soul I sinned: In body and soul I suffer. What I bade My minions do to others, that of woe I bear myself; and in the pause of ill, As now, I know again the bitter pang Of failure, which of old pierced thro' my soul And left me to despair. The pain of mind Is fiercer far than any bodily ill, And both are mine‚Äîthe pang of torture-pain Always recurring; and, far worse, the pang Of consciousness of black sins sinned in vain‚Äî The doom of constant failure. Will, fierce Will! Thou parent of unrest and toil and woe, Measureless effort! growing day by day To force strong souls along the giddy steep That slopes to the pit of Hell, where effort serves Only to speed destruction! Yet I know Thou art not, as some hold, the primal curse Which doth condemn us; since thou bearest in thee No power to satisfy thyself; but rather, The spring of act, whereby in earth and heaven Both men and gods do breathe and live and are, Since Life is Act and not to Do is Death‚Äî I do not blame thee: but to work in vain Is bitterest penalty: to find at last The soul all fouled with sin and stained with blood In vain; ah, this is hell indeed‚Äîthe hell Of lost and striving souls!‚Äù Then as I passed, The halting figure bent itself again To the old task, and up the rugged steep Thrust the great rock with groanings. Horror chained My parting footsteps, like a nightmare dream Which holds us that we flee not, with fixed eyes That loathe to see, yet cannot choose but gaze Till all be done. Slowly, with dreadful toil And struggle and strain, and bleeding hands and knees, And more than mortal strength, against the hill He pressed, the wretched one! till with long pain He trembled on the summit, a gaunt form, With that great rock above him, poised and strained, Now gaining, now receding, now in act To win the summit, now borne down again, And then the inevitable crash‚Äîthe mass Leaping from crag to crag. But ere it ceased In dreadful silence, and the low groan came, My limbs were loosed with one convulsive bound; I hid my face within my hands, and fled, Surfeit with horror. Then it was again A woman whom I saw, pitiless, stern, Bearing the brand of blood‚Äîa lithe dark form, And cruel eyes which burned beneath the gems That argued her a Queen, and on her side An ancient stain of gore, which did befoul Her royal robe. A murderess in thought And dreadful act, who took within the toils Her kingly Lord, and slew him of old time After burnt Troy. I had no time to speak When she shrieked thus: ‚ÄúIt doth repent me not. I would 'twere yet to do, and I would do it Again a thousand times, if the shed blood Might for one hour restore me to the kisses Of my √Ügisthus. Oh, he was divine, My hero, with the godlike locks and eyes Of Eros' self! What boots it that they prate Of wifely duty, love of spouse or child, Honour or pity, when the swift fire takes A woman's heart, and burns it out, and leaps With fierce forked tongue around it, till it lies In ashes, a dead heart, nor aught remains Of old affections, naught but the new flame Which is unquenched desire? It did not come, My blessing, all at once, but the slow fruit Of solitude and midnight loneliness, And weary waiting for the tardy news Of taken Troy. Long years I sate alone, Widowed, within my palace, while my Lord Was over seas, waging the accurs√®d war, First of the file of Kings. Year after year Came false report, or harder, no report Of the great fleet. The summers waxed and waned, The wintry surges smote the sounding shores, And yet there came no end of it. They brought Now hopeless failure, now great victories; And all alike were false, all but delay And hope deferred, which coming not, can break The strong heart suffering wrings not. So I bore Long time the solitary years, and sought To solace the dull days with motherly cares For those my Lord had left me. My firstborn, Iphigeneia, sailed at first with him Upon that fatal voyage, but the young Orestes and Electra stayed with me‚Äî Not dear as she was, for the firstborn takes The mother's heart, and, with the milk it draws From the mother's virgin breast, drains all the love It bore, ay, even tho' the sire be dear; Much more, then, when he is a King indeed, Mighty in war and council, but too high To stoop to a woman's love. But she was gone, Nor heard I tidings of her, knowing not If yet she walked the earth, nor if she bare The load of children, even as I had borne Her in my opening girlhood, when I leapt From child to Queen, but never loved the King. Thus the slow years rolled onward, till at last There came a dreadful rumour‚Äî‚ÄòShe is dead, Thy daughter, years ago. The cruel priests Clamoured for blood; the stern cold Kings stood round Without a tear, and he, her sire, with them, To see a virgin bleed. They cut with knives The slender girlish throat; they watched the blood Drip slowly on the sand, and the young life Meek as a lamb come to the sacrifice To appease the angry gods.‚Äô And he, the King, Her father, stood by too, and saw them work The wickedness, breathing no word of wrath, Till all was done! The cowards! the dull cowards! I would some black storm, bursting suddenly, Had whelmed them and their fleets, ere yet they dared To waste an innocent life! I had gone mad, I know it, but for him, my own, my dear, My fair sweet love. He came to comfort me With words of friendship, holding that my Lord Was bound, perhaps, to let her die‚Äî‚ÄòThe gods Were ofttimes hard to appease‚Äîor was it indeed The priests who asked it? Were there any gods? Or only phantoms, creatures of the brain, Born of the fears of men, the greed of priests, Useful to govern women? Had he been Lord of the fleet, not all the soothsayers Who ever frighted cowards should have sunk His soul to such black depths.‚Äô I hearkening to him As 'twere my own thought grown articulate, Found my grief turn to hate, and hate to love‚Äî Hate of my Lord, love of the voice which spoke Such dear and comfortable words. And thus, Love to a storm of passion growing, swept My wounded soul and dried my tears, as dries The hot sirocco all the bitter pools Of salt among the sand. I never knew True love before; I was a child, no more, When the King cast his eyes on me. What is it To have borne the weight of offspring 'neath the zone If Love be not their sire; or live long years Of commerce, not of love? Better a day Of Passion than the long unlovely years Of wifely duty, when Love cometh not To wake the barren days! And yet at first I hesitated long, nor would embrace The blessing that was mine. We are hedged round, We women, by such close-drawn ordinances, Set round us by our tyrants, that we fear To overstep a hand's breadth the dull bounds Of custom; but at last Love, waking in me, Burst all my chains asunder, and I lived For naught but Love. My son, the young Orestes, I sent far off; my girl Electra only Remained, too young to doubt me, and I knew At last what 'twas to live. So the swift years Fleeted and found me happy, till the black Ill-omened day when Rumour, thousand-tongued, Whispered of taken Troy; and from my dream Of happiness, sudden I woke, and knew The coming retribution. We had grown Too loving for concealment, and our tale Of mutual love was bruited far and wide Through Argos. All the gossips bruited it, And were all tongue to tell it to the King When he should come. And should the cold proud Lord I never loved, the murderer of my girl, Come 'twixt my love and me? A swift resolve Flashed through me pondering on it: Love for Love And Blood for Blood‚Äîthe simple golden rule Taught by the elder gods. When I had taken My fixed resolve, I grew impatient for it, Counting the laggard days. Oh, it was sweet To simulate the yearning of a wife Long parted from her Lord, and mock the fools Who dogged each look and word, and but for fear Had torn me from my throne‚Äîthe pies, the jays, The impotent chatterers, who thought by words To stay me in the act! 'Twas sweet to mock them And read distrust within their eyes, when I, Knowing my purpose, bade them quick prepare All fitting honours for the King, and knew They dared not disobey‚Äîoh, 'twas enough To wing the slow-paced hours. But when at last I saw his sails upon the verge, and then The sea worn ship, and marked his face grown old, The body a little bent, which was so straight, The thin gray hairs which were the raven locks Of manhood when he went, I felt a moment I could not do the deed. But when I saw The beautiful sad woman come with him, The future in her eyes, and her pale lips Silent, but charged with doom, two thoughts at once Assailed me, bidding me despatch with a blow Him and his mistress, making sure the will Of fate, and my revenge. Oh, it was strange To see all happen as we planned; as 'twere Some drama oft rehearsed, wherein each step, Each word, is so prepared, the poorest player Knows his turn come to do‚Äîthe solemn landing‚Äî The ride to the palace gate‚Äîthe courtesies Of welcome‚Äîthe mute crowds without‚Äîthe bath Prepared within‚Äîthe precious circling folds Of tissue stretched around him, shutting out The gaze, and folding helpless like a net The mighty limbs‚Äîthe battle-axe laid down Against the wall, and I, his wife and Queen, Alone with him, waiting and watching still, Till the woman shrieked without. Then with swift step I seized the axe, and struck him as he lay Helpless, once, twice, and thrice‚Äîonce for my girl, Once for my love, once for the woman, and all For Fate and my Revenge! He gave a groan, Once only, as I thought he might; and then No sound but the quick gurgling of the blood, As it flowed from him in streams, and turned the pure And limpid water of the bath to red‚Äî I had not looked for that‚Äîit flowed and flowed, And seemed to madden me to look on it, Until my love with hands bloody as mine, But with the woman's blood, rushed in, and eyes Rounded with horror; and we turned to go, And left the dead alone. But happiness Still mocked me, and a doubt unknown before Came on me, and amid the silken shows And luxury of power I seemed to see Another answer to my riddle of life Than that I gave myself, and it was ‚Äòmurder;‚Äô And in my people's sullen mien and eyes, ‚ÄòMurder;‚Äô and in the mirror, when I looked, ‚ÄòMurder‚Äô glared out, and terror lest my son Returning, grown to manhood, should avenge His father's blood. For somehow, as 'twould seem, The gods, if gods there be, or the stern Fate Which doth direct our little lives, do filch Our happiness‚Äîthough bright with Love's own ray, There comes a cloud which veils it. Yet, indeed, My days were happy. I repent me not; I would wade through seas of blood to know again Those keen delights once more. But my young girl Electra, grown to woman, turned from me Her modest maiden eyes, nor loved to set Her kiss upon my cheek, but, all distraught With secret care, hid her from all the pomps And revelries which did befit her youth, Walking alone; and often at the tomb Of her lost sire they found her, pouring out Libations to the dead. And evermore I did bethink me of my son Orestes, Who now should be a man; and yearned sometimes To see his face, yet feared lest from his eyes His father's soul should smite me. So I lived Happy and yet unquiet‚Äîa stern voice Speaking of doom, which long time softer notes Of careless weal, the music that doth spring From the fair harmonies of life and love, Would drown in their own concord. This at times, Nay, day by day, stronger and dreadfuller, With dominant accent, marred the sounds of joy By one prevailing discord. So at length I came to lose the Present in the dread Of what might come; the penalty that waits Upon successful sin; who, having sinned, Had missed my sin's reward. Until one day I, looking from my palace casement, saw A humble suppliant, clad in pilgrim garb, Approach the marble stair. A sudden throb Thrilled thro' me, and the mother's heart went forth Thro' all disguise of garb and rank and years, Knowing my son. How fair he was, how tall And vigorous, my boy! What strong straight limbs And noble port! How beautiful the shade Of manhood on his lip! I longed to burst From my chamber down, yearning to throw myself Upon his neck within the palace court, Before the guards‚Äîspurning my queenly rank, All but my motherhood. And then a chill Of doubt o'erspread me, knowing what a gulf Fate set between our lives. impassable As that great gulf which yawns 'twixt life and death And 'twixt this Hell and Heaven. I shrank back, And turned to think a moment, half in fear, And half in pain; dividing the swift mind, Yet all in love. Then came a cry, a groan, From the inner court, the clash of swords, the fall Of a corpse upon the pavement; and one cried, ‚ÄòThe King is dead, slain by the young Orestes, Who cometh hither.‚Äô With the word, the door Flew open, and my son stood straight before me, His drawn sword dripping blood. Oh, he was fair And terrible to see, when from his limbs, The suppliant's mantle fallen, left the mail And arms of a young warrior. Love and Hate, Which are the offspring of a common sire, Strove for the mastery, till within his eyes I saw his father's ghost glare unappeased From out Love's casements. Then I knew my fate And his‚Äîmine to be slain by my son's hand, And his to slay me, since the Furies drave Our lives to one destruction; and I took His point within my breast. But I praise not The selfish, careless gods who wrecked our lives, Making the King the murderer of his girl, And me his murderess; making my son The murderer of his mother and her love‚Äî A mystery of blood!‚ÄîI curse them all, The careless Forces, sitting far withdrawn Upon the heights of Space, taking men's lives For playthings, and deriding as in sport Our happiness and woe‚ÄîI curse them all. We have a right to joy; we have a right, I say, as they have. Let them stand confessed The puppets that they are‚Äîtoo weak to give The good they feign to love, since Fate, too strong For them as us, beyond their painted sky, Sits and derides them, all. I curse Fate too, The deaf blind Fury, taking human souls And crushing them, as a dull fretful child Crushes its toys and knows not with what skill Those feeble forms are feigned. I curse, I loathe, I spit on them. It doth repent me not. I would 'twere yet to do. I have lived my life. I have loved. See, there he lies within the bath, And thus I smite him! thus! Didst hear him groan? Oh, vengeance, thou art sweet! What, living still? Ah me! we cannot die! Come, torture me, Ye Furies‚Äîfor I love not soothing words‚Äî As once ye did my son. Ye miserable Blind ministers of Hell, I do defy you; Not all your torments can undo the Past Of Passion and of Love!‚Äù Even as she spake There came a viewless trouble in the air, Which took her, and a sweep of wings unseen, And terrible sounds, which swooped on her and hushed Her voice, and seemed to occupy her soul With horror and despair; and as she passed I marked her agonized eyes. But as I went, Full many a dreadful shape of lonely pain I saw. What need to tell them? We are filled Who live to-day with a more present sense Of the great love of God, than those of old Who, groping in the dawn of Knowledge, saw Only dark shadows of the Unknown; or he, First-born of later singers, who swept deep His awful lyre, and woke the voice of song, Dumb thro' the age-long night. We dread to-day To dwell on those long agonies its sin Brings on the offending soul; who through a creed Of deeper Pity, know what chains of ill Confine our petty lives. Each phase of woe, Suffering, and torture which the gloomy thought Of bigots feigns for others‚Äîall were there. One there was stretched upon a rolling wheel, Which was the barren round of sense, that still Returned upon itself and broke the limbs Bound to it day and night. Others I saw Doomed, with unceasing toil, to fill the urns Whose precious waters sank ere they could slake Their burning thirst. Another shapeless soul, Full of revolts and hates and tyrannous force, The weight of earth, which was its earth-born taint, Pressed groaning down, while with fierce beak and claw, The vulture of remorse, piercing his breast, Preyed on his heart. For others, overhead, Great crags of rock impending seemed to fall, But fell not nor brought peace. I felt my soul Blunted with horrors, yearning to escape To where, upon the limits of the wood, Some scanty twilight grew. But ere I passed From those grim shades a deep voice sounded near, A voice without a form. ‚ÄúThere is an end Of all things that thou seest! There is an end Of Wrong and Death and Hell, when the long wear Of Time and Suffering has effaced the stain Ingrown upon the soul, and the cleansed spirit, Long ages floating on the wandering winds Or rolling deeps of Space, renews itself And doth regain its dwelling, and, once more Blent with the general order, floats anew Upon the stream of Things, Virgil, ‚Äú√Üneid‚Äù vi. 740. and comes at length, After new deaths, to that dim waiting-place Thou next shalt see, and with the justified White souls awaits the End; or, snatched at once, If Fate so will, to the pure sphere itself, Lives and is blest, and works the Eternal Work Whose name and end is Love! There is an end Of Wrong and Death and Hell!‚Äù Even as I heard, I passed from out the shadow of Death and Pain, Crying, ‚ÄúThere is an end!‚Äù BOOK II. HADES. Then from those dark And dreadful precincts passing, ghostly fields And voiceless took me. A faint twilight veiled The leafless, shadowy trees and herbless plains. There stirred no breath of air to wake to life The slumbers of the world. The sky above Was one gray, changeless cloud; there looked no eye Of Life from the veiled heavens; but Sleep and Death Compassed me everywhere. And yet no fear Nor horror took me here, where was no pain Nor dread, save that strange tremor which assails One who in life's hot noontide looks on death And knows he too shall die. The ghosts which rose From every darkling copse showed thin and pale‚Äî Thinner and paler far than those I left In agony; even as Pity seems to wear A thinner form than Fear. Not caged alone Like those the avenging Furies purged were these, Nor that dim land as those black cavernous depths Where no hope comes. Fair souls were they and white Whom there I saw, waiting as we shall wait, The Beatific End, but thin and pale As the young faith which made them, touched a little By the sad memories of the earth; made glad A little by past joys: no more; and wrapt In musing on the brief play played by them Upon the lively carth, yet ignorant Of the long lapse of years, and what had been Since they too breathed Life's air, or if they knew Keeping some echo only; but their pain Was fainter than their joy, and a great hope Like ours possessed them dimly. First I saw A youth who pensive leaned against the trunk Of a dark cypress, and an idle flute Hung at his side. A sorrowful sad soul, Such as sometimes he knows, who meets the gaze, Mute, uncomplaining yet most pitiful, Of one whom Nature, by some secret spite, Has maimed and left imperfect; or the pain Which fills a poet's eyes. Beneath his robe I seemed to see the scar of cruel stripes, Too hastily concealed. Yet was he not Wholly unhappy, but from out the core Of suffering flowed a secret spring of joy, Which mocked the droughts of Fate, and left him glad And glorying in his sorrow. As I gazed He raised his silent flute, and, half ashamed, Blew a soft note; and as I stayed awhile I heard him thus discourse‚Äî ‚ÄúThe flute is sweet To gods and men, but sweeter far the lyre And voice of a true singer. Shall I fear To tell of that great trial, when I strove And Ph≈ìbus conquered? Nay, no shame it is To bow to an immortal melody; But glory. Once among the Phrygian hills I lay a-musing,‚Äîwhile the silly sheep Wandered among the thyme‚Äîupon the bank Of a clear mountain stream, beneath the pines, Safe hidden from the noon. A dreamy haze Played on the uplands, but the hills were clear In sunlight, and no cloud was on the sky. It was the time when a deep silence comes Upon the summer earth, and all the birds Have ceased from singing, and the world is still As midnight, and if any live thing move‚Äî Some fur-clad creature, or cool gliding snake‚Äî Within the pipy overgrowth of weeds, The ear can catch the rustle, and the trees And earth and air are listening. As I lay, Faintly, as in a dream, I seemed to hear A tender music, like the √Üolian chords, Sound low within the woodland, whence the stream, Flowed full, yet silent. Long, with ear to ground, I hearkened; and the sweet strain, fuller grown, Rounder and clearer came, and danced along In mirthful measure now, and now grown grave In dying falls, and sweeter and more clear, Tripping at nuptials and high revelry, Wailing at burials, rapt in soaring thoughts, Chanting strange sea-tales full of mystery, Touching all chords of being, life and death, Now rose, now sank, and always was divine, So strange the music came. Till, as I lay Enraptured, shrill a sudden discord rang, Then all the sounds were still. A lightning-flash, As from a sun-kissed gem, revealed the wood; A noise of water smitten, and on the heights A fair white fleece of cloud, which swiftly climbed Into the furthest heaven. Then, as I mused, Knowing a parting goddess, straight I saw A wayward splendour float upon the stream, And knew it for this jewelled flute, which paused Before me on an eddy. It I snatched Eager, and to my ardent lips I bore The wonder, and behold, with the first breath‚Äî The first warm human breath, the silent strains, The half-drowned notes which late the goddess blew, Revived, and sounded clearer, sweeter far Than mortal skill could make. Rapt with delight, I left my flocks to wander o'er the wastes Untended, and the wolves and eagles seized The innocent lambs, but I was for my art‚Äî Naught else; and though the high-pitched notes divine Grew faint, yet something lingered, and at last So sweet a note I sounded of my skill, That all the Phrygian highlands, all the far Hill villages, were fain to hear the strain, Which the mad shepherd made. Then, overbold, And rapt in my new art, at last I dared To challenge Ph≈ìbus' self. 'Twas a fair day When sudden, on the mountain side, I saw A train of fleecy clouds in a white band Descending. Down the gleaming pinnacles And difficult crags they floated, and the arch, Drawn with its jewelled hues against the sun, Hung like a glory o'er them. Midst the pines They clothed themselves with form, and straight I knew The immortals. Young Apollo, with his lyre, Kissed into gold, and all the Muses clad In robes of gleaming white; then a great fear, Yet mixed with joy, assailed me, for I knew Myself a mortal equalled with the gods. Ah me! how fair they were! how fair and dread In face and form, they showed, when now they stayed Upon the thymy slope, and the young god Lay with his choir around him, beautiful And bold as Youth and Dawn! There was no cloud Upon the sky, nor any sound at all When I began my strain. No coward fear Of what might come restrained me; but an awe Of those immortal eyes and ears divine Looking and listening. All the earth seemed full Of ears for me alone‚Äîthe woods, the fields, The hills, the skies were listening Scarce a sound My flute might make; such subtle harmonies The silence seemed to weave round me and flout The half unuttered thought. Till last I blew, As now, a hesitating note, and lo! The breath divine, lingering on mortal lips, Hurried my soul along to such sweet rhymes, Deeper than wont, that swift I knew my life Blossom within me, and expand, and all The human, which so nearly is divine, Was glorified, and on the Muses' lips, And in their lovely eyes, I saw a mute Approval, and my soul in me was glad. For all the strains I blew were strains of love‚Äî Love striving, love triumphant, love that lies Within belov√®d arms, and wreathes his locks With flowers, and lets the world go by and sings Unheeding; and I saw a kindly gleam Lighting the Muses' gaze, who were, indeed, Women, though god-like. But upon the face Of the young Sun-god only haughty scorn Sate, and he swiftly struck his golden lyre, And played the Song of Life; and lo, I knew My strain, how earthy! Oh, to hear the young Apollo playing! and the secret cells And chambers of the Universe displayed Before the charm√®d sound! I seemed to float In some enchanted cave, where the wave dips In from the sunlit sea, and floods its depths With reflex hues of heaven. My soul was rapt By that I heard, and dared to wish no more For victory; and yet because the sound Of music that is born of human breath Comes straighter from the soul than any strain The hand alone can make; therefore I knew, With a mixed thrill of pity and delight, The nine immortal Sisters hardly touched By that fine strain of music, as by mine, And when the high lay trembled to its close, Still doubting. Then upon the Sun-god's face There passed a cold proud smile. He swept his lyre Once more, then laid it down, and with clear voice, The voice of godhead, sang. Oh, ecstasy, Oh happiness of him who once has heard Apollo singing! For his ears the sound Of grosser music dies, and all the earth Is full of subtle undertones, which take The listener and transform him. As he sang‚Äî Of what I know not, but the music touched Each chord of being‚ÄîI felt my hidden life Stand open to it, as the parched earth yawns To drink the summer rain; and at the call Of those refreshing waters, all my soul Stir from its undiscovered depths, and burst Into sweet, odorous flowers, and from their wells Deep call to deep, and all the mystery Of all that is, laid open. As he sang, I saw the Nine, with lovely pitying eyes, Sign ‚ÄòHe has conquered.‚Äô Yet I felt no pang Of fear, only deep joy that I had heard Such music while I lived, even though it brought Torture and death. For what were it to lie Sleek, crowned with roses, drinking vulgar praise, And surfeited with offerings, the dull gift Of ignorant hands‚Äîall which I might have known‚Äî To this diviner failure? Godlike 'tis To climb upon the icy ledge, and fall Where other footsteps dare not. So I knew My fate, and it was near. For to a pine They bound me willing, and with cruel stripes Tore me, and took my life. But from my blood Was born the stream of song, and on its flow My poor flute, to the clear swift river borne, Floated, and thence adown a lordlier tide Into the deep, wide sea. I do not blame Ph≈ìbus, or Nature which has set this bar Betwixt success and failure, for I know How far high failure overleaps the bound Of low successes. Only suffering draws The inmost heart of song and can elicit The perfumes of the soul. 'Twere not enough To fail, for that were happiness to him Who ever upward looks with reverent eye And seeks but to admire. So, since the race Of bards soars highest; as who seek to show Our lives as in a glass; therefore it comes That suffering weds with song, from him of old, Who solaced his blank darkness with his lyre; Through all the story of neglect and scorn, Necessity, sheer hunger, early death, Which smite the singer still. Not only those Who keep clear accents of the voice divine Are honourable‚Äîthey are happy, indeed, Whate'er the world has held‚Äîbut those who hear Some fair faint echoes, though the crowd be deaf, And see the white gods' garments on the hills, Which the crowd sees not, though they may not find Fit music for their thought; they too are blest, Not pitiable. Not from arrogant pride Nor over-boldness fail they who have striven To tell what they have heard, with voice too weak For such high message. More it is than ease, Palace and pomp, honours and luxuries, To have seen white Presences upon the hills, To have heard the voices of the Eternal Gods.‚Äù So spake he, and I seemed to look on him, Whose sad young eyes grow on us from the page Of his own verse: who did himself to death: Or whom the dullard slew: or whom the sea Rapt from us: and I passed without a word, Slow, grave, with many musings. Then I came On one a maiden, meek with folded hands, Seated against a rugged face of cliff, In silent though. Anon she raised her arms, Her gleaming arms, above her on the rock, With hands which clasped each other, till she showed As in a statue, and her white robe fell Down from her maiden shoulders, and I knew The fair form as it seemed chained to the stone By some invisible gyves, and named her name: And then she raised her frightened eyes to mine As one who, long expecting some great fear, Scarce sees deliverance come. But when she saw Only a kindly glance, a softer look Came in them, and she answered to my thought With a sweet voice and low. ‚ÄúI did but muse Upon the painful past, long dead and done, Forgetting I was saved. The angry clouds Burst always on the low flat plains, and swept The harvest to the ocean; all the land Was wasted. A great serpent from the deep, Lifting his horrible head above their homes, Devoured the children. And the people prayed In vain to careless gods. On that dear land, Which now was turned into a sullen sea, Gazing in safety from the stately towers Of my sire's palace, I, a princess, saw, Lapt in soft luxury, within my bower The wreck of humble homes come whirling by, The drowning, bleating flocks, the bellowing herds, The grain scarce husbanded by toiling hands Upon the sunlit plain, rush to the sea, With floating corpses. On the rain-swept hills The remnant of the people huddled close, Homeless and starving. All my being was filled With pity for them, and I joyed to give What food and shelter and compassionate hands Of woman might. I took the little ones And clasped them shivering to the virgin breast Which knew no other touch but theirs, and gave Raiment and food. My sire, not stern to me, Smiled on me as he saw. My gentle mother, Who loved me with a closer love than binds A mother to her son; and sunned herself In my fresh beauty, seeing in my young gaze Her own fair vanished youth; doted on me, And fain had kept my eyes from the sad sights That pained them. But my heart was faint in me, Seeing the ineffable miseries of life, And that mysterious anger of the gods, And helpless to allay them. All in vain Were prayer and supplication, all in vain The costly victims steamed. The vengeful clouds Hid the fierce sky, and still the ruin came. And wallowing his grim length within the flood, Over the ravaged fields and homeless homes, The fell sea-monster raged, sating his jaws With blood and rapine. Then to the dread shrine Of Ammon went the priests, and reverend chiefs Of all the nation. White-robed, at their head, Went slow my royal sire. The oracle Spoke clear, not as ofttimes in words obscure, Ambiguous. And as we stood to meet The suppliants‚Äîshe who bare me, with her head Upon my neck‚Äîwe cheerful and with song Welcomed their swift return; auguring well From such a quick-sped mission. But my sire Hid his face from me, and the crowd of priests And nobles looked not at us. And no word Was spoken till at last one drew a scroll And gave it to the queen, who straightway swooned, Having read it, on my breast, and then I saw, I the young girl whose soft life scarcely knew Shadow of sorrow, I whose heart was full Of pity for the rest, what doom was mine. I think I hardly knew in that dread hour The fear that came anon; I was transformed Into a champion of my race, made strong With a new courage, glorying to meet, In all the ecstasy of sacrifice, Death face to face. Some god, I know not who, O'erspread me, and despite my mother's tears And my stern father's grief, I met my fate Unshrinking. When the moon rose clear from cloud Once more again upon the midnight sea, And that vast watery plain, where were before Hundreds of happy homes, and well-tilled fields, And purple vineyards; from my father's towers The white procession went along the paths, The high cliff paths, which well I loved of old, Among the myrtles. Priests with censers went And offerings, robed in white, and round their brows The sacred fillet. With his nobles walked My sire with breaking heart. My mother clung To me the victim, and the young girls went With wailing and with tears. A solemn strain The soft flutes sounded, as we went by night To a wild headland, rock-based in the sea. There on a sea-worn rock, upon the verge, To some rude stanchions, high above my head, They bound me. Out at sea, a black reef rose, Washed by the constant surge, wherein a cave Harboured deep down the monster. The sad queen Would scarcely leave me, though the priests shrank back In terror. Last, torn from my endless kiss, Swooning they bore her upwards. All my robe Fell from my lifted arms, and left displayed The virgin treasure of my breasts; and then The white procession through the moonlight streamed Upwards, and soon their soft flutes sounded low Upon the high lawns, leaving me alone. There stood I in the moonlight, left alone Against the sea-worn rock. Hardly I knew, Seeing only the bright moon and summer sea, Which gently heaved and surged, and kissed the ledge With smooth warm tides, what fate was mine. I seemed, Soothed by the quiet, to be musing still Within my maiden chamber, and to watch The moonlight thro' my lattice. Then again Fear came, and then the pride of sacrifice Filled me, as on the high cliff lawns I heard The wailing cries, the chanted liturgies, And knew me bound forsaken to the rock, And saw the monster-haunted depths of sea. So all night long upon the sandy shores I heard the hollow murmur of the wave, And all night long the hidden sea caves made A ghostly echo; and the sea birds mewed Around me; once I heard a mocking laugh, As of some scornful Nereid; once the waters Broke louder on the scarped reefs, and ebbed As if the monster coming; but again He came not, and the dead moon sank, and still Only upon the cliffs the wails, the chants, And I forsaken on my sea-worn rock, And lo, the monster-haunted depths of sea. Till at the dead dark hour before the dawn, When sick men die, and scarcely fear itself Bore up my weary eyelids, a great surge Burst on the rock, and slowly, as it seemed, The sea sucked downward to its depths, laid bare The hidden reefs, and then before my eyes‚Äî Oh, terrible! a huge and loathsome snake Lifted his dreadful crest and scaly side Above the wave, in bulk and length so large, Coil after hideous coil, that scarce the eye Could measure its full horror; the great jaws Dropped as with gore; the large and furious eyes Were fired with blood and lust. Nearer he came, And slowly, with a devilish glare, more near, Till his hot f≈ìtor choked me, and his tongue, Forked horribly from out his poisonous jaws, Played lightning-like around me. For awhile I swooned, and when I knew my life again, Death's bitterness was past. Then with a bound Leaped up the broad red sun above the sea, And lit the horrid fulgour of his scales, And struck upon the rock; till as I turned My head in the last agony of death, I knew a brilliant sunbeam swiftly leaping Downward from crag to crag, and felt new hope Where all was hopeless. On the hills a shout Of joy, and on the rocks the ring of mail; And while the hungry serpent's gloating eyes Were fixed on me, a knight in casque of gold And blazing shield, who with his flashing blade Fell on the monster. Long the conflict raged, Till all the rocks were red with blood and slime, And yet my champion from those horrible jaws And dreadful coils was scatheless. Zeus his sire Protected, and the awful shield he bore Withered the monster's life and left him cold; Dragging his helpless length and grovelling crest: And o'er his glaring eyes the films of death Crept, and his writhing flank and hiss of hate The great deep swallowed down, and blood and spume Rose on the waves; and a strange wailing cry Resounded o'er the waters, and the sea Bellowed within its hollow-sounding caves. Then knew I, I was saved, and with me all The people. From my wrists he loosed the gyves, My hero; and within his godlike arms Bore me by slippery rock and difficult path, To where my mother prayed. There was no need To ask my love. Without a spoken word Love lit his fires within me. My young heart Went forth, Love calling, and I gave him all. Dost thou then wonder that the memory Of this supreme brief moment lingers still, While all the happy uneventful years Of wedded life, and all the fair young growth Of offspring, and the tranquil later joys, Nay, even the fierce eventful fight which raged When we were wedded, fade and are deceased, Lost in the irrecoverable past? Nay, 'tis not strange. Always the memory Of overwhelming perils or great joys, Avoided or enjoyed, writes its own trace With such deep characters upon our lives, That all the rest are blotted. In this place, Where is not action, thought, or count of time, It is not weary as it were on earth, To dwell on these old memories. Time is born Of dawns and sunsets, days that wax and wane And stamp themselves upon the yielding face Of fleeting human life; but here there is Morning nor evening, act nor suffering, But only one unchanging Present holds Our being suspended. One blest day indeed, Or centuries ago or yesterday, There came among us one who was Divine, Not as our gods, joyous and breathing strength And careless life, but crowned with a new crown Of suffering, and a great light came with him, And with him he brought Time and a new sense Of dim, long-vanished years; and since he passed I seem to see new meaning in my fate, And all the deeds I tell of. Evermore The young life comes, bound to the cruel rocks Alone. Before it the unfathomed sea Smiles, filled with monstrous growths that wait to take Its innocence. Far off the voice and hand Of love kneel by in agony, and entreat The seeming careless gods. Still when the deep Is smoothest, lo, the deadly fangs and coils Lurk near, to smite with death. And down the crags Of Duty, like a sudden sunbeam, springs Some golden soul half mortal, half divine, Heaven-sent, and breaks the chain; and evermore For sacrifice they die, through sacrifice They live, and are for others, and no grief, Which smites the humblest but reverberates Thro' all the close-set files of life, and takes The princely soul that from its royal towers Looks down and sees the sorrow. Sir, farewell! If thou shouldst meet my children on the earth Or here, for maybe it is long ago Since I and they were living, say to them I only muse a little here, and wait The waking.‚Äù And her lifted arms sank down Upon her knees, and as I passed I saw her Gazing with soft rapt eyes, and on her lips A smile as of a saint. And then I saw A manly hunter pace along the lea, His bow upon his shoulder, and his spear Poised idly in his hand: the face and form Of vigorous youth; but in the full brown eyes A timorous gaze as of a hunted hart, Brute-like, yet human still, even as the Faun Of old, the dumb brute passing into man, And dowered with double nature. As he came I seemed to question of his fate, and he Answered me thus: ‚Äú'Twas one hot afternoon That I, a hunter, wearied with my day, Heard my hounds baying fainter on the hills, Led by the flying hart; and when the sound Faded and all was still, I turned to seek, O'ercome by heat and thirst, a little glade, Beloved of old, where, in the shadowy wood, The clear cold crystal of a mossy pool Lipped the soft emerald marge, and gave again The flower-starred lawn where ofttimes overspent I lay upon the grass and careless bathed My limbs in the sweet lymph. But as I neared The hollow, sudden through the leaves I saw A throng of wood-nymphs fair, sporting undraped Round one, a goddess. She with timid hand Loosened her zone, and glancing round let fall Her robe from neck and bosom, pure and bright, (For it was Dian's self I saw, none else) As when she frees her from a fleece of cloud And swims along the deep blue sea of heaven On sweet June nights. Silent awhile I stood, Rooted with awe, and fain had turned to fly, But feared by careless footstep to affright Those chaste cold eyes. Great awe and reverence Held me, and fear; then Love with passing wing Fanned me, and held my eyes, and checked my breath, Signing ‚ÄòBeware!‚Äô So for a time I watched, Breathless as one a brooding nightmare holds, Who fleeth some great fear, yet fleeth not; Till the last flutter of lawn, and veil no more Obscured, and all the beauty of my dreams Assailed my sense. But ere I raised my eyes, As one who fain would look and see the sun, The first glance dazed my brain. Only I knew The perfect outline flow in tender curves, To break in doubled charms; only a haze Of creamy white, and dimpled depths divine: And then no more. For lo! a sudden chill, And such thick mist as shuts the hills at eve, Oppressed me gazing; and a heavensent shame, An awe, a fear, a reverence for the unknown, Froze all the springs of will and left me cold, And blinded all the longings of my eyes, Leaving such dim reflection still as mocks Him who has looked on a great light, and keeps On his closed eyes the image. Presently, My fainting soul, safe hidden for awhile Deep in Life's mystic shades, renewed herself, And straight, the innocent brute within the man Bore on me, and with half-averted eye I gazed upon the secret. As I looked, A radiance, white as beamed the frosty moon On the mad boy and slew him, beamed on me; Made chill my pulses, checked my life and heat; Transformed me, withered all my soul, and left My being burnt out. For lo! the dreadful eyes Of Godhead met my gaze, and through the mask And thick disguise of sense, as through a wood, Pierced to my life. Then suddenly I knew An altered nature, touched by no desire For that which showed so lovely, but declined To lower levels. Nought of fear or awe, Nothing of love was mine. Wide-eyed I gazed, But saw no spiritual beam to blight My brain with too much beauty, no undraped And awful majesty; only a brute, Dumb charm, like that which draws the brute to it, Unknowing it is drawn. So gradually I knew a dull content o'ercloud my sense, And unabashed I gazed, like that dumb bird Which thinks no thought and speaks no word, yet fronts The sun that blinded Homer‚Äîall my fear Sunk with my shame, in a base happiness. But as I gazed, and careless turned and passed Through the thick wood, forgetting what had been, And thinking thoughts no longer, swift there came A mortal terror: voices that I knew, My own hounds' bayings that I loved before, As with them often o'er the purple hills I chased the flying hart from slope to slope, Before the slow sun climbed the Eastern peaks, Until the swift sun smote the Western plain; Whom often I had cheered by voice and glance, Whom often I had checked with hand and thong, Grim followers, like the passions, firing me; True servants, like the strong nerves, urging me On many a fruitless chase, to find and take Some too swift-fleeting beauty; faithful feet And tongues, obedient always: these I knew, Clothed with a new-born force and fiercer grown, And stronger than their master; and I thought, What if they tare me with their jaws, nor cared That once I ruled them,‚Äîbrute pursuing brute, And I the quarry? Then I turned and fled,‚Äî If it was I indeed that feared and fled‚Äî Down the long glades, and through the tangled brakes, Where scarce the sunlight pierced; fled on and on, And panted, self-pursued. But evermore The dissonant music which I knew so sweet, When by the windy hills, the echoing vales, And whispering pines it rang, now far, now near, As from my rushing steed I leant and cheered With voice and horn the chase‚Äîthis brought to me Fear of I knew not what, which bade me fly, Fly always, fly; but when my heart stood still, And all my limbs were stiffened as I fled, Just as the white moon ghost-like climbed the sky, Nearer they came and nearer, baying loud, With bloodshot eyes and red jaws dripping foam; And when I strove to check their savagery, Speaking with words; no voice articulate came, Only a dumb, low bleat. Then all the throng Leapt swift on me, and tare me as I lay, And left me man again. Wherefore I walk Along these dim fields peopled with the ghosts Of heroes who have left the ways of earth For this faint ghost of them. Sometimes I think, Pondering on what has been, that all my days Were shadows, all my life an allegory; And, though I know sometimes some fainter gleam Of the old beauty move me, and sometimes Some beat of the old pulses; that my fate, For ever hurrying on in hot pursuit, To fall at length self-slain, was but a tale Writ large by Zeus upon a mortal life, Writ large, and yet a riddle. For sometimes I read its meaning thus: Life is a chase, And Man the hunter, always following on, With hounds of rushing thought or fiery sense, Some hidden truth or beauty, fleeting still For ever through the thick-leaved coverts deep And wind-worn wolds of time. And if he turn A moment from the hot pursuit to seize Some chance-brought sweetness, other than the search To which his soul is set,‚Äîsome dalliance, Some outward shape of Art, some lower love, Some charm of wealth and sleek content and home,‚Äî Then, if he check an instant, the swift chase Of fierce untempered energies which pursue, With jaws unsated and a thirst for act, Bears down on him with clanging shock, and whelms His prize and him in ruin. And sometimes I seem to myself a thinker, who at last, Amid the chase and capture of low ends, Pausing by some cold well of hidden thought Comes on some perfect truth, and looks and looks Till the fair vision blinds him. And the sum Of all his lower self pursuing him, The strong brute forces, the unchecked desires, Finding him bound and speechless, deem him now No more their master, but some soulless thing; And leap on him, and seize him, and possess His life, till through death's gate he pass to life, And, his own ghost, revives. But looks no more Upon the truth unveiled, save through a cloud Of creed and faith and longing, which shall change One day to perfect knowledge. But whoe'er Shall read the riddle of my life, I walk In this dim land amid dim ghosts of kings, As one day thou shalt; meantime, fare thou well.‚Äù Then passed he; and I marked him slowly go Along the winding ways of that weird land, And vanish in a wood. And next I knew A woman perfect as a young man's dream, And breathing as it seemed the nimble air Of the fair days of old, when man was young And life an Epic. Round the lips a smile Subtle and deep and sweet as hers who looks From the old painter's canvas, and derides Life and the riddle of things, the aimless strife, The folly of Love, as who has proved it all, Enjoyed and suffered. In the lovely eyes A weary look, no other than the gaze Which ofttimes as the rapid chariot whirls, And ofttimes by the glaring midnight streets, Gleams out and chills our thought. And yet not guilt Nor sorrow was it; only weariness, No more, and still most lovely. As I named Her name in haste, she looked with half surprise, And thus she seemed to speak: ‚ÄúWhat? Dost thou know, Thou too, the fatal glances which beguiled Those strong rude chiefs of old? Has not the gloom Of this dim land withdrawn from out mine eyes The glamour which once filled them? Does my cheek Retain the round of youth and still defy The wear of immemorial centuries? And this low voice, long silent, keeps it still The music of old time? Aye, in thine eyes I read it, and within thine eyes I see Thou knowest me, and the story of my life Sung by the blind old bard when I was dead, And all my lovers dust. I know thee not, Thee nor thy gods, yet would I soothly swear I was not all to blame for what has been, The long fight, the swift death, the woes, the tears, The brave lives spent, the humble homes uptorn, To gain one poor fair face. It was not I That curved these lips into this subtle smile, Or gave these eyes their fire, nor yet made round This supple frame. It was not I, but Love, Love mirroring himself in all things fair, Love that projects himself upon a life, And dotes on his own image. Ah! the days, The weary years of Love and feasts and gold, The hurried flights, the din of clattering hoofs At midnight, when the heroes dared for me, And bore me o'er the hills; the swift pursuits Baffled and lost; or when from isle to isle The high-oared galley spread its wings and rose Over the swelling surges, and I saw, Time after time, the scarce familiar town, The shadowy hills, the well-loved palaces, The gleaming temples fade, and all for me, Me the dead prize, the shell, the soulless ghost, The husk of a true woman; the fond words Wasted on careless ears, that feigned to hear, Of love to me unloving; the rich feasts, The silken dalliance and soft luxury, The fair observance and high reverence For me who cared not, to whatever land My kingly lover snatched me. I have known How small a fence Love sets between the king And the strong hind, who breeds his brood, and dies Upon the field he tills. I have exchanged People for people, crown for glittering crown, Through every change a queen, and held my state Hateful, and sickened in my soul to lie Stretched on soft cushions to the lutes' low sound, While on the wasted fields the clang of arms Rang, and the foemen perished, and swift death, Hunger, and plague, and every phase of woe Vexed all the land for me. I have heard the curse Unspoken, when the wife widowed for me Clasped to her heart her orphans starved for me; As I swept proudly by. I have prayed the gods, Hating my own fair face which wrought such woe, Some plague divine might light on it and leave My curse a ruin. Yet I think indeed They had not cursed but pitied, those true wives Who mourned their humble lords, and straining felt The innocent thrill which swells the mother's heart Who clasps her growing boy; had they but known The lifeless life, the pain of hypocrite smiles, The dead load of caresses simulated, When Love stands shuddering by to see his fires Lit for the shrine of gold. What if they felt The weariness of loveless love which grew And through the jealous palace portals seized The caged unloving woman, sick of toys, Sick of her gilded chains, her ease, herself, Till for sheer weariness she flew to meet Some new unloved seducer? What if they knew No childish loving hands, or worse than all, Had borne them sullen to a sire unloved, And left them without pain? I might have been, I too, a loving mother and chaste wife, Had Fate so willed. For I remember well How one day straying from my father's halls Seeking anemones and violets, A girl in Spring-time, when the heart makes Spring Within the budding bosom, that I came Of a sudden through a wood upon a bay, A little sunny land-locked bay, whose banks Sloped gently downward to the yellow sand, Where the blue wave creamed soft with fairy foam, And oft the Nereids sported. As I strayed Singing, with fresh-pulled violets in my hair And bosom, and my hands were full of flowers, I came upon a little milk-white lamb, And took it in my arms and fondled it, And wreathed its neck with flowers, and sang to it And kissed it, and the Spring was in my life, And I was glad. And when I raised my eyes Behold, a youthful shepherd with his crook Stood by me and regarded as I lay, Tall, fair, with clustering curls, and front that wore A budding manhood. As I looked a fear Came o'er me, lest he were some youthful god Disguised in shape of man, so fair he was; But when he spoke, the kindly face was full Of manhood, and the large eyes full of fire Drew me without a word, and all the flowers Fell from me, and the little milk-white lamb Strayed through the brake, and took with it the white Fair years of childhood. Time fulfilled my being With passion like a cup, and with one kiss Left me a woman. Ah! the precious hours, When on the warm bank crowned with flowers we sate And thought no harm, and his thin reed pipe made Low music, and no witness of our love Intruded, but the tinkle of the flock Stole from the hill, and 'neath the odorous shade We dreamed away the day, and watched the waves Smile shoreward, and beyond the sylvan capes The innumerable laughter of the sea! Ah youth and love! So passed the happy days Till twilight, and I stole as in a dream Homeward, and lived as in a happy dream, And when they spoke answered as in a dream, And through the darkness saw, as in a glass, The happy, happy day, and thrilled and glowed And kept my love in sleep, and longed for dawn And scarcely stayed for hunger, and with morn Stole eager to the little wood, and fed My life with kisses. Ah! the joyous days Of innocence, when Love was Queen in heaven, And nature unreproved! Break they then still, Those azure circles, on a golden shore? Smiles there no glade upon the older earth Where spite of all, gray wisdom, and new gods, Young lovers dream within each other's arms Silent, by shadowy grove, or sunlit sea? Ah days too fair to last! There came a night When I lay longing for my love, and knew Sudden the clang of hoofs, the broken doors, The clash of swords, the shouts, the groans, the stain Of red upon the marble, the fixed gaze Of dead and dying eyes,‚Äîthat was the time When first I looked on death,‚Äîand when I woke From my deep swoon, I felt the night air cool Upon my brow, and the cold stars look down, As swift we galloped o'er the darkling plain; And saw the chill sea glimpses slowly wake, With arms unknown around me. When the dawn Broke swift, we panted on the pathless steeps, And so by plain and mountain till we came To Athens, where they kept me till I grew Fairer with every year, and many wooed, Heroes and chieftains, but I loved not one. And then the avengers came and snatched me back To Sparta. All the dark high-crested chiefs Of Argos wooed me, striving king with king For one fair foolish face, nor knew I kept No heart to give them. Yet since I was grown Weary of honeyed words and suit of love, I wedded a brave chief, dauntless and true. But what cared I? I could not prize at all His honest service. I had grown so tired Of loving and of love, that when they brought News that the fairest shepherd on the hills, Having done himself to death for his lost love, Lay, like a lovely statue, cold and white Upon the golden sand, I hardly knew More than a passing pang. Love, like a flower, Love, springing up too tall in a young breast, The growth of morning, Life's too scorching sun Had withered long ere noon. Love, like a flame On his own altar offering up my heart, Had burnt my being to ashes. Was it love That drew me then to Paris? He was fair, I grant you, fairer than a summer morn, Fair with a woman's fairness, yet in arms A hero, but he never had my heart, Not love for him allured me, but the thirst For freedom, if in more than thought I erred, And was not rapt but willing. For my child Born to an unloved father, loved me not, The fresh sea called, the galleys plunged, and I Fled willing from my prison and the pain Of undesired caresses, and the wind Was fair, and on the third day as we sailed, My heart was glad within me when I saw The towers of Ilium rise beyond the wave. Ah, the long years, the melancholy years, The miserable melancholy years! For soon the new grew old, and then I grew Weary of him, of all, of pomp and state And novel splendour. Yet at times I knew Some thrill of pride within me as I saw From those high walls, a prisoner and a foe, The swift ships flock at anchor in the bay, The hasty landing and the flash of arms, The lines of royal tents upon the plain, The close-shut gates, the chivalry within Issuing in all its pride to meet the shock Of the bold chiefs without; so year by year The haughty challenge from the warring hosts Rang forth, and I with a divided heart Saw victory incline, now here, now there, And helpless marked the Argive chiefs I knew, The spouse I left, the princely loves of old, Now with each other strive, and now with Troy: The brave pomp of the morn, the fair strong limbs, The glittering panoply, the bold young hearts, Athirst for fame of war, and with the night The broken spear, the shattered helm, the plume Dyed red with blood, the ghastly dying face, And nerveless limbs laid lifeless. And I knew The stainless Hector whom I could have loved, But that a happy love made blind his eyes To all my baleful beauty; fallen and dragged His noble, godlike head upon the sand By young Achilles' chariot; him in turn Fallen and slain; my fair false Paris slain; Plague, famine, battle, raging now within, And now without, for many a weary year, Summer and winter, till I loathed to live, Who was indeed, as well they said, the Hell Of men, and fleets, and cities. As I stood Upon the walls, ofttimes a longing came, Looking on rage, and fight, and blood, and death, To end it all, and dash me down and die; But no god helped me. Nay, one day I mind I would entreat them. ‚ÄòPray you, lords, be men. What fatal charm is this which At√© gives To one poor foolish face? Be strong, and turn In peace, forget this glamour, get you home With all your fleets and armies, to the land I love no longer, where your faithful wives Pine widowed of their lords, and your young boys Grow wild to manhood. I have nought to give, No heart, nor prize of love for any man, Nor recompense. I am the ghost alone Of the fair girl ye knew; she still abides, If she still lives and is not wholly dead, Stretched on a flowery bank upon the sea In fair heroic Argos. Leave this form That is no other than the outward shell Of a once loving woman.‚Äô As I spake, My pity fired my eyes and flushed my cheek With some soft charm; and as I spread my hands, The purple, glancing down a little, left The marble of my breasts and one pink bud Upon the gleaming snows. And as I looked With a mixed pride and terror, I beheld The brute rise up within them, and my words Fall barren on them. So I sat apart, Nor ever more looked forth, while every day Brought its own woe. The melancholy years, The miserable melancholy years, Crept onward till the midnight terror came, And by the glare of burning streets I saw Palace and temple reel in ruin and fall, And the long-baffled legions, bursting in By gate and bastion, blunted sword and spear With unresisted slaughter. From my tower I saw the good old king; his kindly eyes In agony, and all his reverend hairs Dabbled with blood, as the fierce foeman thrust And stabbed him as he lay; the youths, the girls, Whom day by day I knew, their silken ease And royal luxury changed for blood and tears, Haled forth to death or worse. Then a great hate Of life and fate seized on me, and I rose And rushed among them, crying, ‚ÄòSee, 'tis I, I who have brought this evil! Kill me! kill The fury that is I, yet is not I! And let my soul go outward through the wound Made clean by blood to Hades! Let me die, Not these who did no wrong!‚Äô But not a hand Was raised, and all shrank back amazed, afraid, As from a goddess. Then I swooned and fell And knew no more, and when I woke I felt My husband's arms around me, and the wind Blew fair for Greece, and the beaked galley plunged; And where the towers of Ilium rose of old, A pall of smoke above a glare of fire. What then in the near future? Ten long years Bring youth and love to that deep summer-tide When the full noisy current of our lives Creeps dumb through wealth of flowers. I think I knew Somewhat of peace at last, with my good Lord Who loved too much, to palter with the past, Flushed with the present. Young Hermione Had grown from child to woman. She was wed; And was not I her mother? At the pomp Of solemn nuptials and requited love, I prayed she might be happy, happier far Than ever I was; so in tranquil ease I lived a queen long time, and because wealth And high observance can make sweet our days When youth's swift joy is past, I did requite With what I might, not love, the kindly care Of him I loved not; pomps and robes of price And chariots held me. But when Fate cut short His life and love, his sons who were not mine Reigned in his stead, and hated me and mine: And knowing I was friendless, I sailed forth Once more across the sea, seeking for rest And shelter. Still I knew that in my eyes Love dwelt, and all the baleful charm of old Burned as of yore, scarce dimmed as yet by time: I saw it in the mirror of the sea, I saw it in the youthful seamen's eyes, And was half proud again I had such power Who now kept nothing else. So one calm eve, Behold, a sweet fair isle blushed like a rose Upon the summer sea: there my swift ship Cast anchor, and they told me it was Rhodes. There, in a little wood above the sea, Like that dear wood of yore, I wandered forth Forlorn, and all my seamen were apart, And I, alone; when at the close of day I knew myself surrounded by strange churls With angry eyes, and one who ordered them, A woman, whom I knew not, but who walked In mien and garb a queen. She, with the fire Of hate within her eyes, ‚ÄòQuick, bind her, men! I know her; bind her fast!‚Äô Then to the trunk Of a tall plane they bound me with rude cords That cut my arms. And meantime, far below, The sun was gilding fair with dying rays Isle after isle and purple wastes of sea. And then she signed to them, and all withdrew Among the woods and left us, face to face, Two women. Ere I spake, ‚ÄòI know,‚Äô she cried, ‚ÄòI know that evil fairness. This it was, Or ever he had come across my life, That made him cold to me, who had my love And left me half a heart. If all my life Of wedlock was but half a life, what fiend Came 'twixt my love and me, but that fair face? What left his children orphans, but that face? And me a widow? Fiend! I have thee now; Thou hast not long to live. I will requite Thy murders; yet, oh fiend! that art so fair, Were it not haply better to deface Thy fatal loveliness, and leave thee bare Of all thy baleful power? And yet I doubt, And looking on thy face I doubt the more, Lest all thy dower of beauty be the gift Of Aphrodit√©, and I fear to fight Against the immortal Gods.‚Äô Even with the word, And she relenting, all the riddle of life Flashed through me, and the inextricable coil Of Being, and the immeasurable depths And irony of Fate, burst on my thought, And left me smiling in the eyes of death, With this deep smile thou se√´st. Then with a shriek The woman leapt on me, and with blind rage Strangled my life. And when she had done the deed She swooned, and those her followers hasting back Fell prone upon their knees before the corpse As to a goddess. Then one went and brought A sculptor, and within a jewelled shrine They set me in white marble, bound to a tree Of marble. And they came and knelt to me, Young men and maidens, through the secular years, While the old gods bore sway, but I was here, And now they kneel no longer, for the world Has gone from beauty. But I think, indeed, They well might worship still, for never yet Was any thought or thing of beauty born Except with suffering. That poor wretch who thought I injured her, stealing the foolish heart Which she prized but I could not, what knew she Of that I suffered? She had loved her love, Though unrequited, and had borne to him Children who loved her. What if she had been Loved yet unloving: all the fire of love Burnt out before love's time in one brief blaze Of passion. Ah, poor fool! I pity her, Being blest and yet unthankful, and forgive, Now that she is a ghost as I, the hand Which loosed my load of life. For scarce indeed Could any god who cares for mortal men Have ever kept me happy. I had tired Of simple loving, doubtless, as I tired Of splendour and being loved. There be some souls For which love is enough, content to bear From youth to age, from chesnut locks to gray The load of common, uneventful life And penury. But I was not of these; I know not now, if it were best indeed That I had reared my simple shepherd brood, And lived and died unknown in some poor hut Among the Argive hills; or lived a queen As I did, knowing every day that dawned Some high emprise and glorious, and in death To fill the world with song. Not the same meed The gods mete out for all, or She, the dread Necessity, who rules both gods and men, Some to dishonour, some to honour moulds, To happiness some, some to unhappiness. We are what Zeus has made us, discords playing In the great music, but the harmony Is sweeter for them, and the great spheres ring In one accordant hymn. But thou, if e'er There come a daughter of thy love, oh pray To all thy gods, lest haply they should mar Her life with too great beauty!‚Äù So she ceased, The fairest woman that the poet's dream Or artist hand has fashioned. All the gloom Seemed lightened round her, and I heard the sound Of her melodious voice when all was still, And the dim twilight took her. Next there came Two who together walked: one with a lyre Of gold, which gave no sound; the other hung Upon his breast, and closely clung to him, Spent in a tender longing. As they came, I heard her gentle voice recounting o'er Some ancient tale, and these the words she said: ‚ÄúDear voice and lyre now silent, which I heard Across yon sullen river, bringing to me All my old life, while he, the ferryman, Heard and obeyed, and the grim monster heard And fawned on you. Joyous thou cam'st and free Like a white sunbeam from the dear blithe earth, Where suns shone clear, and moons beamed bright, and streams Laughed with a rippling music,‚Äînor as here The dumb stream stole, the veiled sky slept, the fields Were lost in twilight. Like a truant breeze, Which steals in summer from the gates of dawn To kiss the fields of spice, and wakes to life Their slumbering perfume, through this silent land Of whispering voices and of half-closed eyes, Where scarce a footstep sounds, nor any strain Of earthly song, thou cam'st; and suddenly The pale cheeks flushed a little, the murmured words Rose to a faint, thin treble; the throng of ghosts Pacing along the sunless ways and still, Felt a new life. Thou camest, dear, and straight The dull cold river broke in sparkling foam, The pale and scentless flowers grew perfumed; last To the dim chamber, where with the sad queen I sat in gloom, and silently inwove Dead wreaths of amaranths; thy music came Laden with life, and I, who seemed to know Not life's voice only, but my own, arose Along the hollow pathways following The sound which brought back earth and life and love, And memory and longing. Yet I went With half-reluctant footsteps, as of one Whom passion draws, or some high fantasy, Despite himself, because some subtle spell, Part born of dread to cross that sullen stream And its grim guardians, part of secret shame Of the young airs and freshness of the earth, Being that I was, enchained me. Then at last, From voice and lyre so high a strain arose As trembled on the utter verge of being, And thrilling, poured out life. Thus nearer drawn I walked with thee, enclosed by honeyed sound And soft environments of harmony, Beyond the ghostly gates, beyond the dim Calm fields, where the beetle hummed and the pale owl Stole noiseless from the copse, and the white blooms Stretched thin for lack of sun: so fair a light Offspring of consonant airs environed me. Nor looked I backward, as we seemed to move To some high goal of thought and life and love, Like twin birds flying fast with equal wing Out of the night, to meet the coming sun Above a sea. But on thy dear fair eyes, The eyes that well I knew on the old earth, I looked not, for with still averted gaze Thou leddest, and I followed; for, indeed, While that high strain was sounding, I was rapt In faith and a high courage, driving out All doubt and discontent and womanish fear, Nay, even love itself. But when awhile It sank a little, or seemed to sink and fall To lower levels, seeing that use makes blunt The too accustomed ear, straightway, desire To look once more on thy recovered eyes Seized me, and oft I called with piteous voice, Beseeching thee to turn. But thou long time Wert even as one unmindful, with grave sign And waving hand, denying. At the last, When now we neared the stream, on whose far shore Lay life, great terror took me, and I shrieked Thy name, as in despair. Then thou, as one Who knows him set in some great jeopardy, A swift death fronting him on either hand, Didst slowly turning gaze; and lo! I saw Thine eyes grown awful, life that looked on death, Clear purity on black and cankered sin, The immortal on corruption,‚Äînot the eyes That erst I knew in life, but dreadfuller, And stranger. As I looked, I seemed to swoon, Some blind force whirled me back, and when I woke I saw thee vanish in the middle stream, A speck on the dull waters, taking with thee My life, and leaving Love with me. But I Not for myself bewail, but all for thee, Who, but for me, wert now among the stars With thy great Lord; I sitting at thy feet: But now the fierce and unrestrain√®d rout Of passions woman-natured, finding thee Scornful of love within thy lonely cell, With blind rage falling on thee, tore thy limbs, And left them to the Muses' sepulture, While thy soul dwells in Hades. But I wail My weakness always, who for Love destroyed The life that was my Love. I prithee, dear, Forgive me if thou canst, who hast lost heaven To save a loving woman.‚Äù He with voice Sweeter than any mortal melody, And plaintive as the music that is made By the √Üolian strings, or the sad bird That sings of summer nights: ‚ÄúEurydice, Dear love, be comforted; not once alone That which thou mournest is, but day by day Some lonely soul, which walks apart and feeds On high hill pastures, far from herds of men, Comes to the low fat fields, and sunny vales Joyous with fruits and flowers, and the white arms Of laughing love; and there awhile he stays Content, forgetting all the joys he knew, When first the morning broke upon the hills, And the keen air breathed from the Eastern gates Like a pure draught of wine; forgetting all The strains which float, as from a nearer heaven, To him who treads at dawn the untrodden snows, While all the warm world sleeps;‚Äîforgetting these And all things that have been. And if he gain To raise to his own heights the simpler souls That dwell upon the plains, the untutored thought, The museless lives, the unawakened brain That yet might soar, then is he blest indeed. But if he fail, then, leaving love behind, The wider love of the race, the closer love Of some congenial soul, he turns again To the old difficult steeps, and there alone Pines, till the widowed passions of his heart Tear him and rend his soul, and drive him down To the low plains he left. And there he dwells, Missing the nearer skies, and the white peaks, And the keen air of old; but in their stead Finding the soft sweet sun of the vale, the clouds Which veil the heavens indeed, but give the rains That feed the streams of life and make earth green, And bring at last the harvest. So I walk In this dim land content with thee, O Love, Untouched by any yearning of regret For those old days; nor that the lyre which made Erewhile such potent music now is dumb; Nor that the voice that once could move the earth (Zeus speaking through it), speaks in household words Of homely love: Love is enough for me With thee, O dearest; and perchance at last, Zeus willing, this dumb lyre and whispered voice Shall wake, by Love inspired, to such clear note As soars above the stars, and swelling, lifts Our souls to highest heaven.‚Äù Then he stooped, And, folded in one long embrace, they went And faded. And I cried, ‚ÄúOh, strong God, Love, Mightier than Death and Hell!‚Äù And then I chanced On a fair woman, whose sad eyes were full Of a fixed self-reproach, like his who knows Himself the fountain of his grief, and pines In self-inflicted sorrow. As I spake Enquiring of her grief, she answered thus: ‚ÄúStranger, thou seest of all the shades below The most unhappy. Others sought their love In death, and found it, dying; but for me The death that took me, took from me my love, And left me comfortless. No load I bear Like those dark wicked women, who have slain Their Lords for lust or anger, whom the dread Propitious Ones within the pit below Punish and purge of sin; only unfaith, If haply want of faith be not a crime Blacker than murder, when we fail to trust One worthy of all faith, and folly bring No harder recompense than comes of scorn And loathing of itself. Ah, fool, fool, fool, Who didst mistrust thy love, who was the best, And truest, manliest soul with whom the gods Have ever blest the earth; so brave, so strong, Fired with such burning hate of powerful ill, So loving of the race, so swift to raise The strenuous arm and ponderous club, and smite All monstrous growths with ruin‚ÄîZeus himself Showed scarce more mighty‚Äîand yet was the while A very man, not cast in mould too fine For human love, but ofttimes snared and caught By womanish wiles, fast held within the net His passions wove. Oh, it was joy to hear How he went forth, the champion of his race, Conquering in warfare as in love, now bent To more than human tasks, now lapt in ease, Now suffering, now enjoying. Strong, vast soul, Tuned to heroic deeds, and set on high Above the range of common petty sins‚Äî Too high to mate with an unequal soul, Too full of striving for contented days. Ah me, how well I do recall the cause Of all our ills! I was a happy bride When that dark At√© which pursues the steps Of heroes‚Äîinnocent blood-guiltiness‚Äî Drove us to exile, and I joyed to be His own, and share his pain. To a swift stream Fleeing we came, where a rough ferryman Waited, more brute than man. My hero plunged In those fierce depths and battled with their flow, And with great labour gained the strand, and bade The monster speed me to him. But with lust And brutal cunning in his eyes, the thing Seized me and turned to fly with me, when swift An arrow hissed from the unerring bow, Pierced him, and loosed his grasp. Then as his eyes Grew glazed in death there came in them a gleam Of what I know was hate, and he said, ‚ÄòTake This white robe. It is costly. See, my blood Has stained it but a little. I did wrong: I know it, and repent me. If there come A time when he grows cold‚Äîfor all the race Of heroes wander, nor can any love Fix theirs for long‚Äîtake it and wrap him in it, And he shall love again.‚Äô Then, from the strange Deep look within his eyes I shrank in fear, And left him half in pity, and I went To meet my Lord, who rose from that fierce stream Fair as a god. Ah me, the weary days We women live, spending our anxious souls, Consumed with jealous fancies, hungering still For the belov√®d voice and ear and eye, And hungering all in vain! For life is more To youthful manhood than to sit at home Before the hearth to watch the children's ways, And lead the life of petty household care Which doth content us women. Day by day I pined in Trachis for my love, while he, Now in some warlike exploit busied, now Slaying some monster, now at some fair court, Resting awhile till some new enterprise Called him, returned not. News of treacheries Avenged, friends succoured, dreadful monsters slain, Came from him: always triumph, always fame, And honour, and success, and reverence, And sometimes, words of love for me who pined For more than words, and would have gone to him But that the toils of such high errantry Asked more than woman's strength. So the slow years Vexed me alone in Trachis, left forlorn In solitude, nor hearing at the gate The frank and cheering voice, nor on the stair The heavy tread, nor feeling the strong arm Around me in the darkling night, when all My being ran slow. Last, subtle whispers came Of womanish wiles which kept my Lord from me, And one who, young and fair, a fresh-blown life And virgin, younger, fairer far than I When first he loved me, held him in the toils Of scarce dissembled love. Not easily Might I believe this evil, but at last The oft-repeated malice finding me Forlorn, and sitting imp-like at my ear, Possessed me, and the fire of jealous love Raged through my veins, not turned as yet to hate‚Äî Too well I loved for that‚Äîbut breeding in me Unfaith in him. Love, setting him so high And self so low, betrayed me, and I prayed, Constrained to hold him false, the immortal gods To make him love again. But still he came not. And still the maddening rumours worked, and still ‚ÄòFair, young, and a king's daughter,‚Äô the same words Smote me and pierced me. Oh, there is no pain In Hades‚Äînay, nor deepest Hell itself, Like that of jealous hearts, the torture-pain Which racked my life so long. Till one fair morn There came a joyful message. ‚ÄòHe has come! And at the shrine upon the promontory, The fair white shrine upon the purple sea, He waits to do his solemn sacrifice To the immortal gods; and with him comes A young maid beautiful as Dawn.‚Äô Then I, Mingling despair with love, rapt in deep joy That he was come, plunged in the depths of hell That she came too, bethought me of the robe The Centaur gave me, and the words he spake, Forgetting the deep hatred in his eyes, And all but love, and sent a messenger Bidding him wear it for the sacrifice To the Immortals, knowing not at all Whom Fate decreed the victim. Shall my soul Forget the agonized message which he sent, Bidding me come? For that accurs√®d robe, Stained with the poisonous accurs√®d blood, Even in the midmost flush of sacrifice Clung to him a devouring fire, and ate The piteous flesh from his dear limbs, and stung His great soft soul to madness. When I came, Knowing it was my work, he bent on me, Wise as a god through suffering and the near Inevitable Death, so that no word Of mine was needed, such a tender look Of mild reproach as smote me. ‚ÄòCouldst not thou Trust me, who never loved as I love thee? What need was there of magical arts to draw The love that never wavered? I have lived As he lives who through perilous paths must pass, And lifelong trials, striving to keep down The brute within him, born of too much strength And sloth and vacuous days; by difficult toils, Labours endured, and hard-fought fights with ill, Now vanquished, now triumphant; and sometimes, In intervals of too long labour, finding His nature grown too strong for him, falls prone Awhile a helpless prey, then once again Rises and spurns his chains, and fares anew Along the perilous ways. Dearest, I would That thou wert wedded to some knight who stayed At home within thy gates, and were content To see thee happy. But for me the fierce Rude energies of life, the mighty thews, The god-sent hate of Wrong, these drove me forth To quench the thirst of battle. See, this maid, This is the bride I destined for our son Who grows to manhood. Do thou see to her When I am dead, for soon I know again The frenzy comes, and with it ceasing, death. Go, therefore, ere I harm thee when my strength Has lost its guidance. Thou wert rich in love, Be now as rich in faith. Dear, for thy wrong I do forgive thee.‚Äô When I saw the glare Of madness fire his eyes, and my ears heard The groans the torture wrung from his great soul, I fled with broken heart to the white shrine, And knelt in prayer, but still my sad ear took The agony of his cries. Then I who knew There was no hope in god or man for me Who had destroyed my Love, and with him slain The champion of the suffering race of men, And that my jealous soul, though innocent Of blood, was guilty of unfaith and vile Mistrust, and wrapt in weakness like a cloak, And made the innocent tool of hate and wrong, Against all love and good; grown sick and filled With hatred of myself, rose from my knees, And went a little space apart, and found A gnarled tree on the cliff, and with my scarf Strangling myself, swung lifeless. But in death I found him not. For, building a vast pile Of scented woods on Oeta, as they tell, My hero with his own hand lighted it, And when the mighty pyre flamed far and wide Over all lands and seas, he climbed on it And laid him down to die; but pitying Zeus, Before the swift flames reached him, in a cloud Descending, snatched the strong brave soul to heaven, And set him mid the stars. Therefore am I Of all the blameless shades within this place The most unhappy, if of blame, indeed, I bear no load. For what is Sin itself, But Error when we miss the road which leads Up to the gate of heaven? Ignorance! What if we be the cause of ignorance? Being blind who might have seen! Yet do I know But self-inflicted pain, nor stain there is Upon my soul such as they bear who know The dreadful scourge with which the stern judge still Lashes their sins. I am forgiven, I know, Who loved so much, and one day, if Zeus will, I shall go free from hence, and join my Lord, And be with him again.‚Äù And straight I seemed, Passing, to look on some tormented life, Which knows to-day the irony of Fate In self-inflicted pain. Together clung The ghosts whom next I saw, bound three in one By some invisible bond. A sire, of port God-like as Zeus, to whom on either hand A tender stripling clung. I knew them well, As all men know them. One fair youth spake low: ‚ÄúFather, it does not pain me now, to be Drawn close to thee, and by a double bond, With this my brother.‚Äù And the other: ‚ÄúNay, Nor me, O father; but I bless the chain Which binds our souls in union. If some trace Of pain still linger, heed it not‚Äî'tis past: Still let us cling to thee.‚Äù He with grave eyes Full of great tenderness, upon his sons Looked with the father's gaze, that is so far More sweet, and sad, and tender, than the gaze Of mothers,‚Äînow on this one, now on that, Regarding them. ‚ÄúDear sons, whom on the earth I loved and cherished, it was hard to watch Your pain; but now 'tis finished, and we stand For ever, through all future days of time, Symbols of patient suffering undeserved, Endured and vanquished. Yet sad memory still Brings back our time of trial. The young day Broke fair when I, the dread Poseidon's priest, Joyous because the unholy strife was done, And seeing the blue waters now left free Of hostile keels‚Äîsave where upon the verge Far off the white sails faded‚Äîrose at dawn, And white robed, and in garb of sacrifice, And with the sacred fillet round my brows, Stood at the altar; and behind, ye twain, Decked by your mother's hand with new-cleansed robes, And with fresh flower-wreathed chaplets on your curls, Attended, and your clear young voices made Music that touched your father's eyes with tears, If not the careless gods. I seem to hear Those high sweet accents mounting in the hymn Which rose to all the blessed gods who dwelt Upon the far Olympus‚ÄîZeus, the Lord, And Sovereign Here, and the immortal choir Of Deities, but chiefly to the dread Poseidon, him who sways the purple sea As with a sceptre, shaking the fixed earth With stress of thundering surges. By the shrine The meek-eyed victim, for the sacrifice, Stood with his gilded horns. The hymns were done, And I in act to strike, when all the crowd Who knelt behind us, with a common fear Cried, with a cry that well might freeze the blood, And then, with fearful glances towards the sea, Fled, leaving us alone‚Äîme, the high priest, And ye, the acolytes; forlorn of men, Alone, but with our god. But we stirred not We dared not fly, who in the solemn act Of worship, and the ecstasy which comes To the believer's soul, saw heaven revealed, The mysteries unveiled, the inner sky Which meets the enraptured gaze. How should we fear Who thus were god-encircled! So we stood While the long ritual spent itself, nor cast An eye upon the sea. Till as I came To that great act which offers up a life Before life's Lord, and the full mystery Was trembling to completion, quick I heard A stifled cry of agony, and knew My children's voices. And the father's heart, Which is far more than rite or service done By man for god, seeing that it is divine And comes from God to men‚Äîthis rising in me, Constrained me, and I ceased my prayer, and turned To succour you, and lo! the awful coils Which crushed your lives already, bound me round And crushed me also, as you clung to me, In common death. Some god had heard the prayer, And lo! we were ourselves the sacrifice‚Äî The priest, the victim, the accepted life, The blood, the pain, the salutary loss. Was it not better thus to cease and die Together in one blest moment, mid the flush And ecstasy of worship, and to know Ourselves the victims? They were wrong who taught That 'twas some jealous goddess thus assailed Our lives, revengeful for discovered wiles, Or hateful of our Troy. Not readily Should such base passions sway the immortal gods; But rather do I hold it sooth indeed That Zeus himself it was, who pitying The ruin he foreknew, yet might not stay, Since mightier Fate decreed it, sent in haste Those dreadful messengers, and bade them take The pious lives he loved, before the din Of midnight slaughter woke, and the fair town Flamed pitifully to the skies, and all Was blood and ruin. Surely it was best To die as we did, and in death to live, A vision for all ages of high pain Which passes into beauty, and is merged In one accordant whole, as discords merge In that great Harmony which ceaseless rings From the tense chords of life, than to have lived Our separate lives, and died our separate deaths, And left no greater mark than drops which rain Upon the unwrinkled sea. Those hosts which fell Before the Sc√¶an gate upon the sand, Nor found a bard to sing their fate, but left Their bones to dogs and kites‚Äîwere they more blest Than we who, in the people's sight before Ilium's unshattered towers, lay down to die Our swift miraculous death? Dear sons, and good, Dear children of my love, now doubly dear For this our common sorrow; suffering binds Not gyves of pain alone, but fashions for us A chain of purest gold, which though withdrawn Or felt no longer, knits 'tween soul and soul, Indissoluble bonds, and draws our lives So close, that though the individual life Be merged, there springs a common life which grows To such dread beauty, as has power to take The sting from sorrow, and transform the pain Into transcendent joy: as from the storm The unearthly rainbow draws its myriad hues And steeps the world in fairness. All our lives Are notes that fade and sink, and so are merged In the full harmony of Being. Dear sons, Cling closer to me. Life nor Death has torn Our lives asunder, as for some, but drawn Their separate strands together in a knot Closer than Life itself, stronger than Death, Insoluble as Fate.‚Äù Then they three clung Together‚Äîthe strong father and young sons, And in their loving eyes I saw the Pain Fade into Joy, Suffering in Beauty lost, And Death in Love! By a still sullen pool, Into its dark depths gazing, lay the ghost Whom next I passed. In form, a comely youth, Scarce passed from boyhood. Golden curls were his, And wide blue eyes. The semblance of a smile Lighted his lip‚Äîa girl's but for the down Which hardly shaded it; but the pale cheek Was soft as any maiden's, and his robe Was virginal, and at his breast he bore The perfumed amber cup which, when March comes, Gems the dry woods and windy wolds, and speaks The resurrection. Looking up, he said: ‚ÄúMethought I saw her then, my love, my fair, My beauty, my ideal; the dim clouds Lifted, methought, a little‚Äîor was it Fond Fancy only? For I know that here No sunbeam cleaves the twilight, but a mist Creeps over all the sky and fields and pools, And blots them; and I know I seek in vain My earth-sought beauty, nor can Fancy bring An answer to my thought from these blind depths And unawakened skies. Yet has use made The quest so precious, that I keep it here, Well knowing it is vain. On the old earth 'Twas otherwise, when in fair Thessaly I walked regardless of all nymphs who sought My love, but sought in vain, whether it were Dryad or Naiad from the woods or streams, Or white-robed Oread fleeting on the side Of fair Olympus, echoing back my sighs, In vain, for through the mountains day by day I wandered, and along the foaming brooks, And by the pine-woods dry, and never took A thought for love, nor ever 'mid the throng Of loving nymphs who knew me beautiful I dallied, unregarding; till they said Some died for love of me, who loved not one. And yet I cared not, wandering still alone Amid the mountains by the scented pines. Till one fair day, when all the hills were still, Nor any breeze made murmur through the boughs, Nor cloud was on the heavens, I wandered slow, Leaving the nymphs who fain with dance and song Had kept me 'midst the glades, and strayed away Among the pines, enwrapt in fantasy, And by the beechen dells which clothe the feet Of fair Olympus, wrapt in fantasy, Weaving the thin and unembodied shapes Which Fancy loves to body forth, and leave In marble or in song; and so strayed down To a low sheltered vale above the plains, Where the lush grass grew thick, and the stream stayed Its garrulous tongue; and last upon the bank Of a still pool I came, where seemed no flow Of water, but the depths were clear as air, And nothing but the silvery gleaming side Of tiny fishes stirred. There lay I down Upon the flowery bank, and scanned the deep, Half in a waking dream. Then swift there rose, From those enchanted depths, a face more fair Than ever I had dreamt of, and I knew My sweet long-sought ideal: the thick curls. Like these, were golden, and the white robe showed Like this; but for the wondrous eyes and lips, The tender loving glance, the sunny smile Upon the rosy mouth, these knew I not, Not even in dreams; and yet I seemed to trace Myself within them too, as who should find His former self expunged, and him transformed To some high thin ideal, separate From what he was, by some invisible bar, And yet the same in difference. As I moved My arms to clasp her to me, lo! she moved Her eager arms to mine, smiled to my smile, Looked love to love, and answered longing eyes With longing. When my full heart burst in words, ‚ÄòDearest, I love thee,‚Äô lo! the lovely lips, ‚ÄòDearest, I love thee,‚Äô sighed, and through the air The love-lorn echo rang. But when I longed To answer kiss with kiss, and stooped my lips To her sweet lips in that long thrill which strains Soul unto soul, the cold lymph came between And chilled our love, and kept us separate souls Which fain would mingle, and the selfsame heaven Rose, a blue vault above us, and no shade Of earthly thing obscured us, as we lay Two reflex souls, one and yet different, Two sundered souls longing to be at one. There, all day long, until the light was gone And took my love away, I lay and loved The image, and when night was come, ‚ÄòFarewell,‚Äô I whispered, and she whispered back, ‚ÄòFarewell,‚Äô With oh, such yearning! Many a day we spent By that clear pool together all day long. And many a clouded hour on the wet grass I lay beneath the rain, and saw her not, And sickened for her; and sometimes the pool Was thick with flood, and hid her; and sometimes Some rude wind ruffled those clear wells, and left But glimpses of her, and I rose at eve Unsatisfied, a chill in my dead limbs And fever at my heart: until, too soon! The summer faded, and the skies were hid, And my love came not, but a quenchless thirst Wasted my life. And all the winter long The bright sun shone not, or the thick ribbed ice Obscured her, and I pined for her, and knew My life ebb from me, till I grew too weak To seek her, fearing I should see no more My dear. And so the long dead winter waned And the slow spring came back. And one blithe day, When life was in the woods, and the birds sang, And soft airs fanned the hills, I knew again Some gleam of hope within me, and again With feeble force crawled forth, and felt the spring Blossom within me; and the flower-starred glades, The bursting trees, the building nests, the songs, The hurry of life revived me; and I crept, Ghost like, amid the joy, until I flung My panting frame, and weary nerveless limbs, Down by the cold still pool. And lo! I saw My love once more, not beauteous as of old, But oh, how changed! the fair young cheek grown pale, The great eyes, larger than of yore, gaze forth With a sad yearning look; and a great pain And pity took me which were more than love, And with a loud and wailing voice I cried, ‚ÄòDearest, I come again. I pine for thee,‚Äô And swift she answered back, ‚ÄòI pine for thee;‚Äô ‚ÄòCome to me, oh, my own,‚Äô I cried, and she‚Äî ‚ÄòCome to me, oh, my own.‚Äô Then with a cry Of love I joined myself to her, and plunged Beneath the icy surface with a kiss, And fainted, and am here. And now, indeed, I know not if it was myself I sought, As some tell, or another. For I hold That what we seek is but our other self, Other and higher, neither wholly like Nor wholly different, the half-life the gods Retained when half was given‚Äîone the man And one the woman; and I longed to round The imperfect essence by its complement, For only thus the perfect life stands forth Whole, self-sufficing. Worse it is to live Ill-mated than imperfect, and to move From a false centre, not a perfect sphere, But with a crooked bias sent oblique Athwart life's furrows. 'Twas myself, indeed, Thus only that I sought, that lovers use To see in that they love, not that which is, But that their fancy feigns, and view themselves Reflected in their love, yet glorified, And finer and more pure. Wherefore it is: All love which finds its own ideal mate Is happy‚Äîhappy that which gives itself Unto itself, and keeps, through long calm years, The tranquil image in its eyes, and knows Fulfilment and is blest, and day by day Wears love like a white flower, nor holds it less Though sharp winds bite, or hot suns wither, or age Sully its perfect whiteness, but inhales Its fragrance, and is glad. But happier still He who long seeks a high goal unattained, And wearies for it all his days, nor knows Possession sate his thirst, but still pursues The fleeting loveliness‚Äînow seen, now lost, But evermore grown fairer, till at last He stretches forth his arms and takes the fair In one long rapture, and its name is Death.‚Äù Thus he; and seeing me stand grave: ‚ÄúFarewell. If ever thou shouldst happen on a wood In Thessaly, upon the plain-ward spurs Of fair Olympus, take the path which winds Through the close vale, and thou shalt see the pool Where once I found my life. And if in Spring Thou go there, round the margin thou shalt know These amber blooms bend meekly, smiling down Upon the crystal surface. Pluck them not. But kneel a little while, and breathe a prayer To the young god of Love, and let them be. For in those tender flowers is hid the life That once was mine. All things are bound in one In earth and heaven, nor is there any gulf 'Twixt things that live,‚Äîthe flower that was a life, The life that is a flower,‚Äîbut one sure chain Binds all, as now I know. If there are still Fair Oreads on the hills, say to them, sir, They must no longer pine for me, but find Some worthier lover, who can love again; For I have found my love.‚Äù And to the pool He turned, and gazed with dreaming eyes, and showed Fair as an angel. Leaving him enwrapt In musings, to a gloomy pass I came Between dark rocks, where scarce a gleam of light, Not even the niggard light of that dim land, Might enter; and the soil was black and bare, Nor even the thin growths which scarcely clothed The higher fields might live. Hard by a cave Which sloped down steeply to the lowest depths, Whence dreadful sounds ascended, seated still, Her head upon her hands, I saw a maid With eyes fixed on the ground‚Äînot Tartarus It was, but Hades; and she knew no pain, Except her painful thought. Yet there it seemed, As here, the unequal measure which awaits The adjustment, and meanwhile, inspires the strife Which rears life's palace walls; and fills the sail Which bears our bark across unfathomed seas, To its last harbour; this prevailed there too, And 'twas a luckless shade which sat and wept Amid the gloom, though blameless. Suddenly, She raised her head, and lo! the long curls, writhed, Tangled, and snake-like‚Äîas the dripping hair Of a dead girl who freed from life and shame, From out the cruel wintry flow, is laid Stark on the snow with dreadful staring eyes Like hers. For when she raised her eyes to mine, They chilled my blood, so great a woe they bore; And as she gazed, wide-eyed, I knew my pulse Beat slow, and my limbs stiffen. Then they wore, At length, a softer look, and life revived Within my breast as thus she softly spoke: ‚ÄúNay, friend, I would not harm thee. I have known Great sorrow, and sometimes it racks me still, And turns me into stone, and makes my eyes As dreadful as of yore; and yet it comes But seldom, as thou sawest, now, for Time And Death have healing hands. Only I love To sit within the darkness here, nor face The throng of happier ghosts; if any ghost Of happiness come here. For on the earth They wronged me bitterly, and turned to stone My heart, till scarce I knew if e'er I was The happy girl of yore. That youth who dreams Up yonder by the margin of the lake, Knew but a cold ideal love, but me Love in unearthly guise, but bodily form, Seized and betrayed. I was a priestess once, Of stern Athen√©, doing day by day Due worship; raising, every dawn that came, My cold pure hymns to take her virgin ear; Nor sporting with the joyous company Of youths and maids, who at the neighbouring shrine Of Aphrodit√© served. Nor dance nor song Allured me, nor the pleasant days of youth And twilights 'mid the vines. They held me cold Who were my friends in childhood. For my soul Was virginal, and at the virgin shrine I knelt, athirst for knowledge. Day by day The long cold ritual sped, the liturgies Were done, the barren hymns of praise went up Before the goddess, and the ecstasy Of faith possessed me wholly, till almost I knew not I was woman. Yet I knew That I was fair to see, and fit to share Some natural honest love, and bear the load Of children like the rest; only my soul Was lost in higher yearnings. Like a god, He burst upon those pallid lifeless days, Bringing fresh airs and salt, as from the sea, And wrecked my life. How should a virgin know Deceit, who never at the joyous shrine Of Cypris knelt, but ever lived apart, And so grew guilty? For if I had spent My days among the throng, either my fault Were blameless, or undone. For innocence The tempter spreads his net. For innocence The gods keep all their terrors. Innocence It is that bears the burden, which for guilt Is lightened, and the spoiler goes his way, Uncaring, joyous, leaving her alone, The victim and unfriended, Was it just In her, my mistress, who had had my youth, To wreak such vengeance on me? I had erred, It may be; but on him, whose was the guilt, No heaven-sent vengeance lighted, but he sped Away to other hearts across the deep, Careless and free; but me, the cold stern eyes Of the pure goddess withered; and the scorn Of maids, despised before, and the great blank Of love, this wrung my heart, whose love was gone, And froze my blood; set on my brow despair, And turned my gaze to stone, and filled my eyes With horror, and stiffened the soft curls which once Lay smooth and fair into such snake-like rings As made my aspect fearful. All who saw, Shrank from me and grew cold, and felt the warm, Full tide of life freeze in them, seeing in me Love's work, who sat wrapt up and lost in shame, As in a cloak, consuming my own heart, And was in hell already. As they gazed Upon me, my despair looked forth so cold From out my eyes, that if some spoiler came Fresh from his wickedness, and looked on them, Their glare would strike him dead; and those fair curls Which once the accurs√®d toyed with, grew to be The poisonous things thou seest; and so, with hate Of man's injustice and the gods', who knew Me blameless, and yet punished me; and sick Of life and love, and loathing earth and sky, And feeding on my sorrow, Hate at last Left me a Fury. Ah, the load of life Which lives for hatred! We are made to love‚Äî We women, and the injury which turns The honey of our lives to gall, transforms The angel to the fiend. For it is sweet To know the dreadful sense of strength, and smite And leave the tyrant dead with a glance; ay! sweet, In that fierce lust of power, to slay the life Which harmed not, when the suppliants' cry ascends To ears which hate has deafened. So I lived Long time in misery; to my sleepless eyes No healing slumbers coming; but at length, Zeus and the goddess pitying, I knew Soft rest once more veiling my dreadful gaze In peaceful slumbers. Then a blessed dream I dreamt. For, lo! a god-like knight in mail Of gold, who sheared with his keen flashing blade; With scarce a pang of pain, the visage cold Which too great sorrow left me; at one stroke Clean from the trunk, and then o'er land and sea, Invisible, sped with winged heels, to where, Upon a sea worn cape, a fair young maid, More blameless even than I was, chained and bound, Waited a monster from the deep and stood In innocent nakedness. Then, as he rose, Loathsome, from out the depths, a monstrous growth, A creature wholly serpent, partly man, The wrongs that I had known, stronger than death, Rose up with such black hate in me again, And wreathed such hissing poison through my hair, And shot such deadly glances from my eyes, That nought that saw might live. And the vile worm Was slain, and she delivered. Then I dreamt My mistress, whom I thought so stern to me, Athen√©, set those dreadful staring eyes, And that despairing visage, on her shield Of chastity, and bears it evermore To fright the waverer from the wrong he would, And strike the unrepenting spoiler, dead.‚Äù Then for a little paused she, while I saw Again her eyes grow dreadful, till once more, And with a softer glance: ‚ÄúFrom that blest dream I woke not on the earth, but only here. And now my pain is lightened since I know My dream, which was a dream within the dream Which is our life, fulfilled. And I have saved Another through my suffering, and through her A people. Oh, strange chain of sacrifice, That binds an innocent life, and from its blood And sorrow works out joy! Oh, mystery Of pain and evil! wrong grown salutary, And mighty to redeem! If thou shouldst see A woman on the earth, who pays today Like penalty of sin, and the new gods (For after Saturn, Zeus ruled; after him It may be there are others) love to take The tender heart of girlhood, and to immure Within a cold and cloistered cell the life Which nature meant to bless, and if Love come Hold her accurs√®d; or to some poor maid, Forlorn and trusting, still the tempter comes And works his wrong, and leaves her in despair And shame and all abhorrence, while he goes His way unpunished,‚Äîif thou know her eyes Freeze thee like mine‚Äîoh! bid her lose her pain In succouring others‚Äîsay to her that Time And Death have healing hands, and here there comes To the forgiven transgressor only pain Enough to chasten joy!‚Äù And a soft tear Trembled within her eyes, and her sweet gaze Was as the Magdalen's, the horror gone And a great radiance come. Then came I on a shade who seemed of stone So cold and still she showed, She with raised arm And piteous suppliant hand, and outspread robe Was fain to shield the youthful brood she loved Even from the wrath of Heaven, and straight I knew The queenly mother, half divine, the grief Frozen to marble, which the sculptor dreamt And left immortal. When she saw me come And gaze with pity, two warm human tears Stole down her cheeks, and thawed her into life. And when I named her name, the stony eyes Grew softer as I looked, and the sad lips Parted awhile as thus she seemed to speak. ‚ÄúAh me, ah me! on that high mountain peak, Which far above the seething Lydian plains Takes the first dawn-shaft, and the sunset keeps When all the fields grow dark‚ÄîI, Niobe, A mother's heart, pent in a jail of stone, Stood all day in the vengeful sun-god's eye, Stood all night in the cold gaze of the moon, Who both long ages since conspiring, slew My children,‚ÄîI a childless mother now Who was most blest, a grieving woman still, Who am bereft of all, yet cannot die. Ah day, ill-fated day, which wrecked my life! I was the happy mother of strong sons, Brave, beautiful, all in their bloom of age: From him my first-born, grown a bearded man, Through the fair promise of imperfect youth, To the slim stripling who had scarcely left The women's chambers, on whose lip scant shade Of budding manhood showed, I loved them all; All with their father's eyes, and that strange charm Of rhythmic grace, and musical utterance As when, in far-off Thebes, the enchanted wall Rose perfect, to the music of his lyre. Ah me, the fatal day! For at high noon I sate within my Theban palace fair‚Äî Deep summer-time it was‚Äîand marked the crowd From the thronged city street, to the smooth plain, Stream joyously: the brave youths, full of life, Stripped for the mimic fray, the leap, the race, The wrestling; and the princes, my strong sons, The fair limbs I had borne beneath my zone Grown to full stature, such as maidens love,‚Äî The sinewy arms, the broad chests, and strong loins Of manhood; the imperfect, flower-like forms, Eager with youth's first fires; my youngest born, My darling, doffing his ephebic robe Which late he donned with pride, a child in heart, In budding limbs a youth;‚ÄîI see them go, Their fair young bodies glistening in the sun, Which kissed the shining olive. As they went, The joyous concourse winding towards the plain, My happy eyes o'erflowed, and as I turned And saw my daughters round me, fair grown lives And virgin, sitting spinning the white flax, Each with her distaff, beautiful and fit To wed with any stately king of men And reign a queen in Hellas, my glad heart Broke forth in pride, and as I looked I thought ‚ÄòOh happy, happy mother of such sons! Oh happy, happy mother of such girls! For whom full soon the joyous nuptial rites Shall bring the expectant bridegroom and the bride, And soon once more the little childish hands Which shall renew my early wedded years, When the king loved me first. Thrice blest indeed. There is no queen in Hellas such as I, Dowered with such fair-grown offspring; not a queen Nor mother o'er all earth's plain, around which flows The wide salt stream of the encircling sea, As blest as I. Nay, in Olympus' self To all-compelling Zeus, what offspring bare Leto of yore? Ph≈ìbus and Artemis, Offspring divine indeed, but two alone. Poor mother, that to such a lord as Zeus Bare only those, no fairer than my own. Nay, I am happier than a goddess' self; I would not give this goodly train of mine For that scant birth. I ask no boon of Zeus Nor of the Olympian gods; for I am glad; No fruitful mother in a peasant's hut, Scorning the childless great, thinks scorn of me, Being such as I. Nay, let Queen Leto's self Know, that a mortal queen has chanced to bear As fair as hers, and more.‚Äô Even as I spoke, While these unhallowed boastings flushed my pride, Through the closed lattice pierced one angry shaft Of blinding sun, which on the opposite wall Traced some mysterious sign, and on my mind Such vague remorse and consciousness of ill, That straight, that arrogant boldness sank and died In a great dread, nor hardly could I bear To look upon the fairness of my girls, Who, seeing the vague trouble in my eyes, Grew pale, and shuddered for no cause, and gazed Chilled 'midst the blaze of sunlight. Then I strove To laugh my fears away, as one who knows Some great transgression weigh on him, some load Which will not be removed, but bears him down, Though none else knows it, pressing on his heart. But when the half unuttered thought grew dim And my fear with it, suddenly a cry Rose from the city street, and then the sound Of measured hurrying feet, and looking forth To where the youth had passed so late, in joy, Came two who carried tenderly, with tears, A boy's slight form. I had no need to look, For all the mother rising in me knew That 'twas my youngest born they bore; I knew What fate befell him‚Äî'twas the vengeful sun, And I alone was guilty, I, his mother, Who being filled with impious pride, had brought Death to my innocent child. I hurried down The marble stair and met them as they came, Bearing his corpse, and kissed his lips and called His name, yet knew that he was dead; and all His brothers stood regarding us with tears, And would have soothed me with their loving words, Me guilty, who were guiltless, oh, my sons! Till as I looked up from the dead,‚Äîa cry Of agony,‚Äîand then another fell Struggling for life upon the earth, and then Another, and another, till the last Of all my stalwart boys, my life, my pride, Lay dead upon the ground, and the fierce sun Frenzied my brain, and all distraught with woe I to the palace tottered, while they bare Slowly the comely corpses of my sons. That day I dare not think of when they lay, White shrouded, in the darkened palace rooms, Like sculptured statues on a marble hearse. How calm they looked and happy, my dear sons! There was no look of pain within their eyes, The dear dead eyes which I their mother closed; Me miserable! I saw the priests approach, And ministers of death; I saw my girls Flung weeping on the brothers whom they loved. I saw it all as in a dream. I know not How often the dead night woke into day, How often the hot day-time turned to night. I did not shudder even to see the Sun Which slew my sons; but in the still, dead night, When in that chill and lifeless place of death, The cold, clear, cruel moonlight seemed to play Upon the rang√®d corpses, and to mock My mother's heart, and throw on each a hue Of swift corruption ere its time, I knew Some secret terror lest the jealous gods Might find some further dreadful vengeance still, Taking what yet was left. At set of sun The sad procession to the place of graves Went with the rites of royal sepulture, The high priest at its head, the nobles round The dear white shrouded corpses: Last of all I went, the guilty one, my fair sweet girls Clinging to me in tears; but I, I shed not A single tear‚Äîgrief dried the fount of tears, I had shed all mine. Only o'ermastering dread Held me of what might come. When they were laid, Oh, wretched me, my dear, my well-loved sons! Within the kingly tomb, the dying sun Had set, and in his stead the rising moon, Behind some lofty mountain-peak concealed, Relit some ghostly twilight. As we knelt, The people all withdrawn a little space, I and my daughters in that place of death, I lifted up my suppliant voice, and they With sweet girl-accents pure, and soaring hymn, To the great Powers above. But when at last I heard my hollow voice pleading alone And all the others silent, then I looked, And on the tomb the cold malignant moon, Bursting with pale chill beams of light, revealed My fair girls kneeling mute and motionless, Their dead eyes turned to the unpitying orb, Their white lips which should offer prayer no more. Such vengeance wreaked Ph≈ìbus and Artemis Upon a too proud mother. But on me Who only sinned no other punishment They took, only the innocent lives I loved‚Äî If any punishment, indeed, were more Than this to one who had welcomed death. I think My children happier far in death than I Who lived to muse on these things. When my girls Were laid in earth, I, my lone palace gate Leaving without a tear, sped thence in haste To that high rock of Sipylus where erst My father held his court; and there, long years, Summer and winter, stayed I, day and night Gazing upon the far-off plain of Thebes, Wherein I was so happy of old time, Wherein I erred and suffered. Turned to stone They thought me, and 'tis true the mother's heart Which knows such grief as I knew, turns to stone, And all her life; and pitying Zeus, indeed, Seeing my suffering, listened to my prayer And left me seeming stone, but still the heart Of the mother grows not hard, and year by year When comes the summer with its cloudless skies, And the high sun lights hill and plain by day, And the moon, shining, silvers them by night, My old grief, rising dew-like to my eyes, Quickens my life with not unhappy tears, And through my penitent and yearning heart There throbs again a pulse of love and grief: Love triumphing at last o'er Fate and Death, Grief all divine and vindicating Love.‚Äù Thus she; and as I gazed, the tears which fell Dried slowly and again she seemed to turn To marble as before, the sad lips closed, The stony gaze grew fixed, as, ere she told Her sorrow, and I cried ‚ÄúOh, dauntless strength Of motherhood, aye though thro' pride it err Flouting the jealous gods. Oh precious love Of motherhood, Farewell!‚Äù Then as I passed To upper air, I saw two figures rise Together, one a woman with a grave Fair face not all unhappy, and the robes And presence of a queen; and with her walked The comeliest youth that ever maiden's dream Conceived. And as they came, the throng of ghosts, For these who were not wholly ghosts, arose, And did them homage. Not the bond of love Bound them, but such calm kinship as is bred Of long and difficult pilgrimages borne Through common perils by two souls which share A common weary exile. Nor as ghosts These showed, but rather like two lives which hung Suspended in a trance. A halo of life Played round them, and they brought a sweet brisk air Tasting of earth and heaven, like sojourners Who stayed but for awhile, and knew a swift Release await them. First the youth it was Who spake thus as they passed: ‚ÄúDread Queen, once more I feel life stir within me, and my blood Run faster, while a new strange cycle turns And grows completed. Soon on the dear earth, Under the lively light of fuller day, I shall revive me of my wound; and thou, Passing with me yon cold and lifeless stream, And the grim monster who will fawn on thee, Shalt issue in royal pomp, and wreathed with flowers, Upon the cheerful earth, leaving behind A deeper winter for the ghosts who dwell Within these sunless haunts; and I shall lie Once more within loved arms, and thou shalt see Thy early home, and kiss thy mother's cheek, And be a girl again. But not for long; For ere the bounteous Autumn spreads her hues Of gold and purple, a cold voice will call And bring us to these wintry lands once more, As erst so often. Blest are we, indeed, Above the rest, and yet I would I knew The careless joys of old. For in hot youth, Oh, it was sweet to greet the balmy night That was love's nurse, and feel the weary eyes Closed by soft kisses,‚Äîsweet at early dawn To wake refreshed and, scarce from loving arms 'Scaping, to ride afield, with winding horn, By dewy heath and brake, and taste the fresh Young breath of early morning; and 'twas sweet To chase the bounding quarry all day long With my good hounds and trusty steed, and gay Young comrades of my youth, and with the eve To turn home laden with the spoil, and take The banquet which awaited, and sweet wine Poured out, and kisses pressed on loving lips; Circled by snowy arms. Oh, it was sweet To be alive and young! For sure it is The gods gave not quick pulses and hot blood And strength and beauty for no end, but would That we should use them wisely; and the fair, Sweet mistress of my service was, indeed, Worthy of all observance. Oh, her eyes When I lay bleeding! All day long we rode, I and my youthful peers, with horse and hound, And knew the joy of swift pursuit and toil And peril. At the last, a fierce boar turned At bay, and with his gleaming tusks o'erthrew My steed, and as I fell upon the flowers, Pierced me as with a sword. Then, as I lay, I knew the strange slow chill which, stealing, tells The young that it is death. Yet knew I not Or pain or fear, only great pity, indeed, That she should lose her love, who was so fond And gracious. But when, lifting my dim gaze, I saw her bend o'er me,‚Äîthe lovely eyes Suffused with tears, and her sweet smile replaced By sweeter sorrow,‚Äîfor a while I stayed Life's ebbing tide, and raised my cold, white lips, With a faint smile, to hers. Then, with a kiss‚Äî One long last kiss, we mingled, and I knew No more. But even in death, so strong is Love, I could not wholly die; and year by year, When the flowered Spring returns, and the earth lives, Love opens these dread gates, and calls me forth Across the gulf. Not here, indeed, she comes, Being a goddess and in heaven, but smooths My path to the old earth, where still I know Once more the dear lost days, and once again Blossom on that soft breast, and am again A youth, and rapt in love; and yet not all As careless as of yore; but seem to know The early spring of passion, tamed by time And suffering, to a calmer, fuller flow, Less fitful, but more strong.‚Äù Then the sad Queen: ‚ÄúFair youth, thy lot I know, for I am old As the old earth and yet as young as is The budding spring, and I was here a Queen, When Love was not or Time, and to my arms Thou cam√®st as a little child, to dwell Within the halls of Death, for without Death There were nor Birth nor Love, nor would Life yearn To lose itself within another life, And dying, to be born. I, too, have died For love in part, and live again through love; For in the far-off years, when Time was young, And Love unborn on earth, and Zeus in heaven Ruled, a young sovereign; I, a maiden, dwelt With loved Demeter on the sunny plains Of our own Sicily. There, day by day, I sported with my playmate goddesses, In virgin freedom. Budding age made gay Our lightsome feet, and on the flowery slopes We wandered daily, gathering flowers to weave In careless garlands for our locks, and passed The days in innocent gladness. Thought of Love There came not to us, for as yet the earth Was virginal, nor yet had Eros come With his delicious pain. And one fair morn‚Äî Not all the ages blot it‚Äîon the side Of √Ütna we were straying. There was then Summer nor winter, springtide nor the time Of harvest, but the soft unfailing sun Shone always, and the sowing time was one With reaping; fruit and flower together glowed Upon the trees; and blade and ripened ear Together clothed the plains. There, as I strayed, Sudden a black cloud down the rugged side Of √Ütna, mixed with fire and dreadful sound Of thunder, rolled around me, and I heard The maids who were my fellows turn and flee With shrieks and cries for me. But I, I knew No terror while the god o'ershadowed me, Hiding my life in his, nor when I wept, My flowers all withered, and my blood ran slow Within a wintry land. Some voice there was Which said, ‚ÄòFear not. Thou shalt return and see Thy mother again, only a little while Fate wills that thou shouldst tarry, and become Queen of another world. Thou seest that all Thy flowers are faded. They shall live again On earth, as thou shalt, as thou livest now The Life of Death‚Äîfor what is Death but Life Suspended as in sleep? The primal rule Where life was constant, and the sun o'erhead, Blazed forth unchanging, changes and is hidden Awhile. This region which thou seest, where all The trees are lifeless, and the flowers are dead, Is but the self-same earth on which erewhile Thou sportedst fancy free.‚Äô So, without fear I wandered on this bare land, seeing far Upon the sky the peaks of my own hills And crests of my own woods. Till, when I grew Hungered, ere yet another form I saw; Along the silent alleys journeying, And leafless groves; a fair and mystic tree Rose like a heart in shape, and 'mid its leaves One golden mystic fruit with a fair seed Hid in it. This, with childish hand, I took And ate, and straight I knew the tree was Life, And the fruit Death, and the hid seed was Love. Ah, sweet strange fruit! the which if any taste They may no longer keep their lives of old Or their own selves unchanged, but some weird change And subtle alchemy comes which can transmute The blood, and mould the spirits of gods and men In some new magical form. Not as before, Our life comes to us, though the passion cools, Nay, never as before. My mother came Too late to seek me. She had power to raise A life from out Death's grasp, but from the arms Of Love she might not take me, nor undo Love's past for all her strength. She came and sought With fires her daughter over land and sea, Beyond the paths of all the setting stars, In vain, and over all the earth in vain, Seeking whom love disguised. Then on all lands She cast the spell of barrenness; the wheat Was blighted in the ear, the purple grapes Blushed no more on the vines, and all the gods Were sorrowful, seeing the load of ill My rape had laid on men. Last, Zeus himself, Pitying the evil that was done, sent forth His messenger beyond the western rim To fetch me back to earth. But not the same He found me who had eaten of Love's seed, But changed into another; nor could his power Prevail to keep me wholly on the earth, Or make me maid again. The wintry life Is homelier often than the summer blaze Of happiness unclouded; so, when Spring Comes on the world, I, coming, cross with thee, Year after year, the cruel icy stream; And leave this anxious sceptre and the shades Of those in hell, or those for whom, though blest, No Spring comes, till the last great Spring which brings New heavens and new earth; and lay my head Upon my mother's bosom, and grow young, And am a girl again. A soft air breathes Across the stream and fills these barren fields With the sweet odours of the earth. I know Again the perfume of the violets Which bloom on √Ütna's side. Soon we shall pass Together to our home, while round our feet The crocus flames like gold, the windflowers white Wave their soft petals on the breeze, and all The choir of flowers lift up their silent song To the unclouded heavens. Thou, fair boy, Shalt lie within thy love's white arms again, And I within my mother's. Sweet is Love In ceasing and renewal; nay, in these It lives and has its being. Thou couldst not keep Thy youth as now, if always on the breast Of love too late a lingerer thou hadst known Possession sate thee. Nor might I have kept My mother's heart, if I had lived to ripe And wither on the stalk. Time calls and Change Commands both men and gods, and speeds us on We know not whither; but the old earth smiles Spring after Spring, and the seed bursts again Out of its prison mould, and the dead lives Renew themselves, and rise aloft and soar And are transformed, clothing themselves with change Till the last change be done.‚Äù As thus she spake, I saw a gleam of light flash from the eyes Of all the listening shades, and a great joy Thrill through the realms of Death. And then again A youthful shade I saw, a comely boy, With lip and cheek just touched with manly down, And strong limbs wearing Spring; in mien and garb A youthful chieftain, with a perfect face Of fresh young beauty, clustered curls divine, And chiselled features like a sculptured god, But warm and breathing life; only the eyes, The full dark eyes, were full of dreaming thought, And seemed to gaze beyond the world of sight, On a hid world of beauty. Him I stayed, Accosting with soft words of courtesy; And, on a bank of scentless flowers reclined, He answered thus: ‚ÄúNot for the garish sun I long, nor for the splendours of high noon In this dim land I languish; for of yore Full often, when the swift chase swept along Through the brisk morn, or when my comrades called To wrestling, or the foot-race, or to cleave The sunny stream, I loved to walk apart, Self-centred, sole; and when the laughing girls To some fair stripling's oaten melody Made ready for the dance, I heeded not; Nor when to the loud trumpet's blast and blare My peers rode forth to battle. For, one eve, In Latmos, after a long day in June, I stayed to rest me on a sylvan hill, Where often youth and maid were wont to meet Toward moonrise; and deep slumber fell on me Musing on Love, just as the ruddy orb Rose on the lucid night, set in a frame Of blooming myrtle and sharp tremulous plane; Deep slumber fell, and loosed my limbs in rest. Then, as the full orb poised upon the peak, There came a lovely vision of a maid, Who seemed to step as from a silvery skiff Out of the low-hung moon. No mortal form, Such as ofttimes of yore I knew and clasped At twilight 'mid the vines at the mad feast Of Dionysus, or the fair maids cold Who streamed in white processions to the shrine Of the chaste Virgin Goddess; but a shape Richer and yet more pure. No thinnest veil Obscured her; but each exquisite limb revealed, She seemed an ivory statue subtly wrought By a great sculptor on the architrave Of some high temple-front‚Äîonly in her The form was soft and loving, breathing life, And tender. As I seemed to gaze on her, Nearer she drew and gazed; and as I lay Supine, beneath her spell, the radiance stooped And kissed me on the lips, a chaste, sweet kiss, Which drew my spirit with it. So I slept Each night upon the hill, until the Dawn Came in his golden chariot from the East, And chased my Love away. But ever thus Dissolved in love as in a heaven-sent dream, Whenever the bright circle of the moon Climbed from the hills, whether in leafy June Or harvest-tide, or when they leapt and pressed Red-thighed the spouting must, I walked apart From all, and took no thought for mortal maid, Nor nimble joys of youth; but night by night I stole, when all were sleeping, to the hill, And slumbered and was blest; until I grew Possest by love so deep, I seemed to live In slumbers only, while the waking day Showed faint as any vision. So I grew Paler and feebler with the months, and climbed The steep with laboured steps and difficult breath, But still I climbed. Ay, though the wintry frost Chained fast the streams and whitened all the fields, I sought my mistress through the leafless groves, And slumbered and was happy, till the dawn Returning found me stretched out, cold and stark, With life's fire nigh burnt out. Till one clear night, When the birds shivered in the pines, and all The inner heavens stood open, lo! she came, Brighter and kinder still, and kissed my eyes And half-closed lips, and drew my soul through them, And in one precious ecstasy dissolved My life. And thenceforth, ever on the hill I lie unseen of man; a cold, white form, Still young, through all the ages; but my soul, Wearing this thin presentment of old days, Walks this dim land, where never moonrise comes, Nor day-break, but a twilight waiting-time, No more; and, ah! how weary! Yet I judge My lot a higher far than his who spends His youth on swift hot pleasure, quickly past; Or theirs, my equals', who through long calm years Grew sleek in dull content of wedded lives And fair-grown offspring. Many a day for them, While I was wandering here, and my bones bleached Upon the rocks, the sweet autumnal sun Beamed, and the grapes grew purple. Many a day They heaped up gold, they knelt at festivals, They waxed in high report and fame of men, They gave their girls in marriage; while for me Upon the untrodden peaks, the cold, grey morn, The snows, the rains, the winds, the untempered blaze, Beat year by year, until I turned to stone, And the great eagles shrieked at me, and wheeled Affrighted. Yet I judge it better indeed To seek in life, as now I know I sought, Some fair impossible Love, which slays our life, Some fair ideal raised too high for man; And failing, to grow mad, and cease to be, Than to decline, as they do who have found Broad-paunched content and weal and happiness: And so an end. For one day, as I know, The high aim unfulfilled fulfils itself; The deep, unsatisfied thirst is satisfied; And through this twilight, broken suddenly, The inmost heaven, the lucent stars of God, The Moon of Love, the Sun of Life; and I, I who pine here‚ÄîI on the Latmian hill Shall soar aloft and find them.‚Äù With the word, There beamed a shaft of dawn athwart the skies, And straight the sentinel thrush within the yew Sang out reveill√© to the hosts of day, Soldierly; and the pomp and rush of life Began once more, and left me there alone Amid the awaking world. Nay, not alone. One fair shade lingered in the fuller day, The last to come, when now my dream had grown Half mixed with waking thoughts, as grows a dream In summer mornings when the broader light Dazzles the sleeper's eyes; and is most fair Of all and best remembered, and becomes Part of our waking life, when older dreams Grow fainter, and are fled. So this remained The fairest of the visions that I knew, Most precious and most dear. The increasing light Shone through her, finer than the thinnest shade, And yet most full of beauty; golden wings, From her fair shoulders springing, seemed to raise Her stainless feet from the gross earth and lift Their wearer into air; and in her eyes Was such fair glance as comes from virgin love, Long chastened and triumphant. Every soil Of life had vanished from her, and she showed As one who walks a saint already on earth, Virgin or mother. Immortality Breathed from those radiant eyes which yet had passed Between the gates of death. I seemed to hear The Soul of mortals speaking: ‚ÄúI was born Of a great race and mighty, and was grown Fair, as they said, and good, and kept a life Pure from all stain of passion. Love I knew not, Who was absorbed in duty; and the Queen Of gods and men, seeing my life more calm Than human, hating my impassive heart, Sent down her perfect son in wrath to earth, And bade him break me. But when Eros came, It did repent him of the task, for Love Is kin to Duty. And within my life I knew miraculous change, and a soft flame Wherefrom the snows of Duty flushed to rose, And the chill icy depths of mind were stirred By a warm tide of passion. Long I lived Not knowing what had been, nor recognized A Presence walking with me through my life, As if by night, his face and form concealed: A gracious voice alone, which none but I Might hear, sustained me, and its name was Love. Not as the earthly loves which throb and flush Round earthly shrines was mine, but a pure spirit, Lovelier than all embodied love, more pure And wonderful; but never on his eyes I looked, which still were hidden, and I knew not The fashion of his nature; for by night, When visual eyes are blind, but the soul sees, Came he, and bade me think not to make search Or whence he came or wherefore Nor knew I His name. And always ere the coming day, As if he were the Sun-god, lingering With some too well-loved maiden, he would rise And vanish until eve. But all my being Thrilled with my fair unearthly visitant To higher duty and more glorious meed Of action than of old, for it was Love That came to me, who might not know his name. Thus, ever rapt by dreams divine, I knew The scorn that comes from weaker souls, which miss, Being too low of nature, the great joy Revealed to others higher; nay, my sisters, Who being of one blood with me, made choice To tread the flowery ways of daily life, Grew jealous of me, bidding me take heed Lest haply 'twas some monstrous fiend I loved, Such as in fable ofttimes sought and won The innocent hearts of maids. Long time I held My love too dear for doubt, who was so sweet And lovable. But at the last the sneers, The mystery which hid him, the swift flight Before the coming dawn, the shape concealed, The curious girlish heart, tormented me With an unsatisfied thirst. Not his own words: ‚ÄòDear, I am with thee only while I keep My visage hidden; and if thou once shouldst see My face, I must forsake thee: the high gods Link Love with Faith, and he withdraws himself From the full gaze of Knowledge‚Äô‚Äînot even these Could cure me of my longing, or the fear Those mocking voices worked: who fain would learn The worst that might befall. And one sad night, Just ere the day leapt from the hills and brought The hour when he should go: with tremulous hands, Lighting my midnight lamp in fear, I stood Long time uncertain, and at length turned round And gazed upon my love. He lay asleep, And oh, how fair he was! The flickering light Fell on the fairest of the gods, stretched out In happy slumber. Looking on his locks Of gold, and faultless face and smile, and limbs Made perfect, a great joy and trembling took me Who was most blest of women, and in awe And fear I stooped to kiss him. One warm drop‚Äî From the full lamp within my trembling hand, Or a glad tear from my too happy eyes, Fell on his shoulder. Then the god unclosed His lovely eyes, and with great pity spake: ‚ÄòFarewell! There is no Love except with Faith, And thine is dead! Farewell! I come no more.‚Äô And straightway from the hills the pitiless sun Leapt up, and as I clasped my love again, The lovely vision faded from his place, And came no more. Then I, with breaking heart, Knowing my life laid waste by my own hand, Went forth and would have sought to hide my life Within the stream of Death; but Death came not To aid me who not yet was meet for Death. Then finding that Love came not back to me, I thought that in the temples of the gods Haply he dwelt, and so from fane to fane I wandered over earth, and knelt in each, Enquiring for my Love; and I would ask The priests and worshippers, ‚ÄòIs this Love's shrine? Sirs, have you seen she god?‚Äô But never at all I found him. For some answered, ‚ÄòThis is called The Shrine of Knowledge;‚Äô and another, ‚ÄòThis, The Shrine of Beauty;‚Äô and another, ‚ÄòStrength;‚Äô And yet another, ‚ÄòYouth.‚Äô And I would kneel And say a prayer to my Love, and rise And seek another. Long, o'er land and sea, I wandered, till I was not young or fair, Grown wretched, seeking my lost Love; and last, Came to the smiling, hateful shrine where ruled The queen of earthly love and all delight, Cypris, but knelt not there, but asked of one Who seemed her priest, if Eros dwelt with her. Then to the subtle-smiling goddess‚Äô self They led me. She with hatred in her eyes: ‚ÄòWhat! thou to seek for Love, who art grown thin And pale with watching! He is not for thee. What Love is left for such? Thou didst despise Love, and didst dwell apart. Love sits within The young maid's eyes, making them beautiful. Love is for youth, and joy, and happiness; And not for withered lives. Ho! bind her fast. Take her and set her to the vilest tasks, And bend her pride by solitude and tears, Who will not kneel to me, but dares to seek A disembodied love. My son has gone, Leaving thee for thy fault, and thou shalt know The misery of my thralls. Then in her house They bound me to hard tasks and vile, and shut My life from honour, chained among her slaves And lowest ministers, taking despite And injury for food, and set to bind Their wounds whom she had tortured, and to feed The pitiful lives which in her prisons pent Languished in hopeless pain. There is no sight Of suffering but I saw it, and was set To succour it; and all my woman's heart Was torn with the uncounted miseries Which ruthless love has wreaked; and dwelt long time In groanings and in tears. And then, oh joy! Oh miracle! once more again, once more! I felt Love's arms around me, and the kiss Of Love upon my lips, and in the chill Of deepest prison cells, 'mid vilest tasks, The glow of his sweet breath, and the warm touch Of his invisible hand, and his sweet voice, Ay, sweeter than of old, and tenderer, Speak to me, pierce me, hold me, fold me round With arms Divine, till all the sordid earth Was hued like heaven, and Life's dull prison-house Turned to a golden palace, and those low tasks Grew to be higher works and nobler gains Than any gains of knowledge, and at last He whispered softly, ‚ÄòDear, unclose thine eyes, Thou mayest look on me now. I go no more. But am thine own for ever.‚Äô Then with wings Of gold we soared, I looking in his eyes, Over yon dark broad river, and this dim land, Scarce for an instant staying till we reached The inmost courts of heaven. But sometimes still I come here for a little, and speak a word Of peace to those who wait. The slow wheel turns, The cycles round themselves and grow complete, The world's year whitens to the harvest-tide, And one word only am I sent to say To those dear souls, who wait here, or who yet Breathe earthly air ‚Äî one universal word To all things living, and the word is ‚ÄòLove.‚Äô‚Äù Then soared she visibly before my gaze, And the heavens took her, and I knew my eyes Had seen the Soul of man, the deathless Soul, Defeated, struggling, purified, and blest. Then all the choir of happy waiting shades, Heroes and queens, fair maidens and brave youths, Swept by me, rhythmic, slow, as if they trod Some unheard measure, passing where I stood In fair procession, each with a faint smile Upon the lip, signing ‚ÄúFarewell, oh shade! It shall be well with thee, as 'tis with us, If only thou art true. The world of Life, The world of Death, are but opposing sides Of one great orb, and the Light shines on both. Oh, happy, happy shade! Farewell! Farewell!‚Äù And so they passed away. BOOK III. OLYMPUS. But I, my gaze Following the soaring soul which now was lost In the awakening skies, floated with her, As in a trance, beyond the golden gates Which separate Earth from Heaven; and to my thought, Gladdened by that broad effluence of light, This old earth seemed transfigured, and the fields, So dim and bare, grew green and clothed themselves With lustrous hues. A fine ethereal air Played round me as I mused, and filled the soul With an ineffable content. What help In words to tell of things unreached by words? Or how to engrave upon the treacherous thought The fair and fugitive fancies of a dream, Which vanish ere we fix them? But methinks He knows the scene, who knows the one fair day, One only and no more, which year by year In springtime comes, when lingering winter flies, And lo! the bare boughs prankt with white and pink, And golden clusters, and the green glades starred With delicate primrose and deep odorous beds Of violets, and on the tufted meads With kingcups lit, and cowslip bells, and blue Sweet hyacinths, and frail anemones, The broad West wind breathes softly, and the air Is tremulous with the lark, and thro' the woods The soft full-throated thrushes all day long Flood the green dells with joy, and thro' the dry Brown fields the sower strides, sowing his seed, And all is life and song. Or he who first, Whether in fair free boyhood, when the world Is his to choose, or when his fuller life Beats to another life, or afterwards, Keeping his youth within his children's eyes, Looks on the snow-clad everlasting hills, And marks the sunset smite them, and is glad Of the beautiful fair world. A springtide land It seemed, where East winds came not. Sweetest song Was everywhere, by glade or sunny plain; And thro' the golden valleys winding streams Rippled in glancing silver, and above, The blue hills rose, and over all a peak, White, awful, with a constant fleece of cloud Veiling its summit, towered. Unfailing Day Lighted it, for no turn of dawn and eve Came there, nor changing seasons, but a broad Fixed joy of Being, undisturbed by Time. There, in a happy glade shut in by groves Of laurel and sweet myrtle, on a green And flower-lit lawn, I seemed to see the ghosts Of the old gods. Upon the gentle slope Of a fair hill, a joyous company, The Immortals lay. Hard by, a murmurous stream Fell through the flowers; below them, space on space, Laughed the immeasurable plains; beyond, The mystic mountain soared. Height after height Of bare rock ledges left the climbing pines, And reared their giddy, shining terraces Into the ethereal air. Above, the snows Of the white summit cleft the fleece of cloud Which always clothed it round. Ah, fair and sweet, Yet with a ghostly fairness, fine and thin, Those godlike Presences. Not dreams indeed, But something dream-like, were they. Blessed Shades Heroic and Divine, as when, in days When Man was young, and Time, the vivid thought Translated into Form the unattained Impossible Beauty of men's dreams, and fixed The Loveliness in marble. As with awe Following my spotless guide, I stood apart, Not daring to draw near; a shining form Rose from the throng, and floated, light as air, To where I trembled. And I knew the face And form of Artemis, the fair, the pure, The undefiled. A crescent silvery moon Shone thro' her locks, and by her side she bore A quiver of golden darts. At sight of whom I felt a sudden chill, like his who once Looked upon her and died; yet could not fear, Seeing how fair she was. Her sweet voice rang Clear as a bird's: ‚ÄúMortal, what fate hath brought Thee hither, uncleansed by death? How canst thou breathe Immortal air, being mortal! Yet fear not, Since thou art come. For we too are of earth Whom here thou seest: there were not a heaven Were there no earth, nor gods, had men not been, But each the complement of each and grown The other's creature, is and has its being, A double essence, Human and Divine. So that the God is hidden in the man, And something Human bounds and forms the God; Which else had shown too great and undefined For mortal sight, and having no human eye To see it, were unknown. But we who bore Sway of old time, we were but attributes See the Orphic Hymns. Of the great God who is all Things that be‚Äî The Pillar of the Earth and starry Sky, The Depth of the great Deep; the Sun, the Moon, The Word which Makes; the All-compelling Love‚Äî For all Things lie within His Infinite Form.‚Äù Even as she spake, a throng of shapes divine Floated around me, filling all my soul With fair unearthly beauty, and the air With such ambrosial perfume as is born, When morning breathes upon a tropic sea, From boundless wastes of flowers; and as I knelt In rapture, lo! the same clear voice again From out the throng of gods: ‚ÄúThose whom thou seest Were even as I, embodiments of Him Who is the Centre of all Life: myself The Maiden-Queen of Purity; and Strength, Divine when unabused; Love too, the Spring And Cause of Things; and Knowledge, which lays bare Their secret; and calm Duty, Queen of all, And Motherhood in one; and Youth, which bears, Beauty of Form and Life and Light, and breathes The breath of Inspiration; and the Soul, The particle of God, sent down to man, Which doth in turn reveal the world and God. Therefore did all men call on Artemis The refuge of young souls; that still in age They kept some thin reflection uneffaced Of a Diviner Purity than beams On Youth's hot spring-tide, when the fa√´ry world Smiles, and the rapid blood thro' the young veins Courses, and all is glad. Yet sure it is That innocence is young‚Äîbefore the soil And smirch of sadder knowledge, settling on it, Sully its primal whiteness. So they knelt At my white shrines, the eager boyish souls, To whom life's road showed like a dewy field In early summer dawns, when to the sound Of youth's clear voice, and to the cheerful rush Of the tumultuous feet and clamorous tongues Careering onwards, fair and dappled fawns, Strange birds with jewelled plumes, fierce spotted pards, Rise in the joyous chase, to be caught and slain By the young conqueror; nor yet the charm Of sensual ease allures. But chiefly knelt The pure sweet maidens fair and fancy-free, Whose innocent virgin hearts shrank from the touch Of passion as from wrong‚Äîsweet moonlit lives Which fade, and pale, and vanish, in the glare Of Love's hot noontide: these came robed in white, With holy hymns and soaring liturgies: And so men fabled me, a huntress now, Borne thro' the flying woodlands, fair and free; And now the pale cold Moon, Light without warmth, Zeal without touch of passion, heavenly love For human, and the altar for the home. But oh, how sweet it was to take the love And awe of my young worshippers; to watch The pure young gaze and hear the pure young voice Mount in the hymn, or see the gay troop come With the first dawn of day, brushing the dew From the unpolluted fields, and wake to song The slumbering birds; strong in their innocence! I did not envy any goddess of all The Olympian company her votaries! Ah, happy days of old which now are gone! A memory and a dream! for now on earth I rule no longer o'er young willing hearts In voluntary fealty, which would cease When Love, with fiery accents calling, woke The slumbering soul; as now it should for those Who kneel before the purer, sadder shrine Which has replaced my own. But ah! to-day Not seldom, but too often, shut from life Within pale life-long cloisters, and the bars Of sunless convent prisons, year by year, Age after age, the white souls fade and pine Which simulate the joyous service free Of those young worshippers. I would that I Might loose the captives' chain; or Herakles, Who was a mortal once.‚Äù But he who stood Colossal at my side: ‚ÄúI toil no more On earth, nor wield again the mighty strength Which Zeus once gave me for the cure of ill. I have run my race; I have done my work; I rest For ever from the toilsome days I gave To the suffering race of men. And yet, indeed, Methinks they suffer still. Tyrannous growths And monstrous vex them still. Pestilence lurks And sweeps them down. Treacheries come, and wars, And slay them still. Vaulting ambition leaps And falls in bloodshed still. But I am here At rest, and no man kneels to me, or keeps Reverence for strength mighty yet unabused‚Äî Strength which is Power, God's choicest gift, more rare And precious than all Beauty, or the charm Of Wisdom, since it is the instrument Thro' which all Nature works. For now the earth Is full of meekness, and a new God rules, Teaching strange precepts of humility And mercy and forgiveness. Yet I trow There is no lack of bloodshed and deceit And groanings, and the tyrant works his wrong Even as of old; but now there is no arm Like mine, made strong by Zeus, to beat him down, Him and his wrong together. Yet I know I am not all discrowned. The strong brave souls, The manly tender hearts, whom tale of wrong To woman or child, to all weak things and small, Fires like a blow; kindling the righteous flush Of anger on the brow; knotting the cords Of muscle on the arm; with one desire To hew the spoiler down, and make an end, And go their way for others; making light Of toil and pain, and too laborious days, And peril; beat unchanged, albeit they serve A Lord of meekness. For the world still needs Its champion as of old, and finds him still. Not always now with mighty sinews and thews Like mine, though still these profit, but keen brain And voice to move men's souls to love the right And hate the wrong; even tho' the bodily form Be weak, of giant strength, strong to assail The hydra heads of Evil, and to slay The monsters that now waste them: Ignorance, Self-seeking, coward fears, the hate of Man, Disguised as love of God. These labour still With toil as hard as mine. For what was it To strive with bodily ills, and do great deeds Of daring and of strength, and bear the crown, To his high task who wages lifelong strife With an impalpable foe; conquering indeed, But, ere he hears the p√¶an or sees the pomp Laid low in the arms of Death? And tho' men cease To worship at my shrine, yet not the less It is the toils I knew, the pains I bore For others, which have kept the stead fast heart Of manhood undefiled, and nerved the arm Of sacrifice, and made the martyr strong To do and bear, and taught the race of men How godlike 'tis to suffer thro' life, and die At last for others' good!‚Äù The strong god ceased, And stood a little, musing; blest indeed, But bearing, as it seemed, some faintest trace Of earthly struggle still, not the gay ease Of the elder heaven-born gods. And then there came Beauty and Joy in one, bearing the form Of woman. How to reach with halting words That infinite Perfection? All have known The breathing marbles which the Greek has left Who saw her near, and strove to fix her charms, And exquisitely failed; or those fair forms The Painter offered at a later shrine, And failed. Nay, what are words?‚Äîhe knows it well Who loves, or who has loved. She with a smile Playing around her rosy lips; as plays The sunbeam on a stream: ‚ÄúShall I complain Men kneel to me no longer, taking to them Some graver, sterner worship; grown too wise For fleeting joys of Love? Nay, Love is Youth, And still the world is young. Still shall I reign Within the hearts of men, while Time shall last And Life renews itself. All Life that is, From the weak things of earth or sea or air, Which creep or float for an hour; to godlike man‚Äî All know me and are mine. I am the source And mother of all, both gods and men; the spring Of Force and Joy, which, penetrating all Within the hidden depths of the Unknown, Sets the blind germ of Being, and from the bond Of incomplete and dual Essences Evolves the harmony which is Life. The world Were dead without my rays, who am the Light Which vivifies the world. Nay, but for me, The universal order which attracts Sphere unto sphere, and keeps them in their paths For ever, were no more. All things are bound Within my golden chain, whose name is Love. And if there be, indeed, some sterner souls Or sunk in too much learning, or hedged round By care and greed, or haply too much rapt By pale ascetic fervours, to delight To kneel to me, the universal voice Scorns them as those who, spurning wilfully The good that Nature offers, dwell unblest Who might be blest, but would not. Every voice Of bard in every age has hymned me. All The breathing marbles, all the glowing hues Of painting, praise me. Even the love-less shades Of dim monastic cloisters show some gleam, Tho' faint, of me. Amid the busy throngs Of cities reign I, and o'er lonely plains, Beyond the ice-fields of the frozen North And the warm waves of undiscovered seas. For I was fashioned from the sparkling foam Which lights the crest of the blue mystic wave, Stirred by the wandering breath of Life's pure dawn From a young soul's clear depths. There, without voice, Stretched on the breathing curve of a young breast, Fluttering a little, fresh from the great deep Of life, and creamy as the opening rose, Naked I lie, naked yet unashamed, While youth's warm tide steals round me with a kiss, And floods each limb with fairness. Shame I know not‚Äî Shame is for wrong, and not for innocence‚Äî The veil which Error grasps to hide itself From the awful Eye. But I, I lie unveiled And unashamed‚Äîthe livelong day I lie, The warm wave murmuring to me; and, all night, Hidden in the moonlit caves of happy Sleep, I dream until the morning and am glad. Why should I seek to clothe myself, and hide The treasure of my Beauty? Shame may wait On those for whom 'twas given. The sties of sense Are none of mine; the brutish, loveless wrong, The venal charm, the simulated flush Of fleshly passion, they are none of mine, Only corruptions of me. Well I know The counterfeit the stronger, since gross souls And brutish sway the earth; yet not the less All sense is consecrated, and I deem 'Twere better to grow soft and sink in sense Than gloat o'er blood and wrong. My kingdom is O'er infinite grades of life. Yet 'tis in man I find my worthiest worship. Where man is, A youth and a maid, a youth and a maid, nought else Is wanting for my temple. Every clime Kneels to me‚Äîthe long breaker falls in foam Under the palms, swelling the merry noise Of savage bridals, and the straight brown limbs Know me, and over all the endless plains I reign, and by the tents on the hot sand And sea-girt isles am queen, and by the sides Of silent mountains, where the white cots gleam Upon the green hill pastures, and no sound But the thunder of the avalanche is borne To the listening rocks around; and by fair lands Where all is peace; where thro' the happy hush Of tranquil summer evenings, 'mid the corn, Or thro' cool arches of the gadding vines, The lovers stray together hand in hand, Hymning my praise; and by the echoing streets Of stately cities‚Äîo'er the orb√®d earth, The burning South, the icy North, the old And immemorial East, the unbounded West, No new god comes to spoil me utterly‚Äî All worship and are mine!' With a sweet smile Upon her rosy mouth, the goddess ceased; And when she spake no more, the silence weighed As heavy on my soul as when it takes Some gracious melody, and leaves the ear Unsatisfied and longing, till the fount Of sweetness springs again. But while I stood Expectant, lo! a fair pale form drew near With front severe, and wide blue eyes which bore Mild wisdom in their gaze. Clear purity Shone from her‚Äînot the young-eyed innocence Of her whom first I saw, but that which comes From wider knowledge, which restrains the tide Of passionate youth, and leads the musing soul By the calm deeps of Wisdom. And I knew My eyes had seen the fair, the virgin Queen, Who once within her shining Parthenon Beheld the sages kneel. She with clear voice And coldly sweet, yet with a softness too, Such as befits a virgin: ‚ÄúShe doth right To boast her sway, my sister, seeing indeed That all things are as by a double law, And from a double root the tree of Life Springs up to the face of heaven. Body and Soul, Matter and Spirit, lower joys of Sense And higher joys of Thought, I know that both Build up the shrine of Being. The brute sense Leaves man a brute; but, winged with soaring thought Mounts to high heaven. The unembodied spirit, Dwelling alone, unmated, void of sense, Shows impotent. And yet I know there is, Far off, but not too far for mortal reach, A calmer height, where, nearer to the stars, Thought sits alone and gazes with rapt gaze, A large-eyed maiden in a robe of white, Who brings the light of Knowledge down, and draws To her pontifical eyes a bridge of gold, Which spans from earth to heaven. For what were life, If things of sense were all, for those large souls And high, whom grudging Nature has shut fast Within unlovely forms, or from whose life The circuit of the rapid gliding years Steals the brief gift of beauty? Shall men hold With idle singers, all the treasure of hope Is lost with youth‚Äîswift-fleeting, treacherous youth, Which fades and flies before the ripening brain Crowns life with Wisdom's crown? Nay, even in youth, Is it not more to tread the difficult heights Alone‚Äîthe cold free heights‚Äîand mark the vale Lie breathless in the glare, or hidden and blurred By cloud and storm; or pestilence and war Creep on with blood and death; while the soul dwells Apart upon the peaks, outfronts the sun As the eagle does, or takes the coming dawn While all the vale is dark, and knows the springs Of tiny rivulets hurrying from the snows, Which soon shall swell to vast resistless floods, And feed the Oceans which divide the World? Oh, ecstasy! oh, wonder! oh, delight! Which neither the slow-withering wear of Time, That takes all else‚Äîthe smooth and rounded cheek Of youth; the lightsome step; the warm young heart Which beats for love or friend; the treasure of hope Immeasurable; the quick-coursing blood Which makes it joy to be,‚Äîay, takes them all Or makes them naught‚Äînor yet satiety Born of too full possession, takes or mars! Oh, fair delight of learning! which grows great And stronger and more keen, for slower limbs, And dimmer eyes and loneliness, and loss Of lower good‚Äîwealth, friendship, ay, and Love‚Äî When the swift soul, turning its weary gaze From the old vanished joys, projects itself Into the void and floats in empty space, Striving to reach the mystic source of Things, The secrets of the earth and sea and air, The Law that binds the process of the suns, The awful depths of Mind and Thought; the prime Unfathomable mystery of God! Is there, then, any who holds my worship cold And lifeless? Nay, but 'tis the light which cheers The waning life! Love thou thy love, brave youth! Cleave to thy love, fair maid! it is the Law Which dominates the world, that bids ye use Your nature; but, when now the fuller tide Slackens a little, turn your calmer eyes To the fair page of Knowledge. It is power I give, and power is precious. It is strength To live four-square, careless of outward shows, And self-sufficing. It is clearer sight To know the rule of life, the Eternal scheme; And, knowing it, to do and not to err, And, doing, to be blest.‚Äù The calm voice soared Higher and higher to the close; the cold Clear accents, fired as by a hidden fire, Glowed into life and tenderness, and throbbed As with some spiritual ecstasy Sweeter than that of Love. But as they died, I heard an ampler voice; and looking, marked A fair and gracious form. She seemed a Queen Who ruled o'er gods and men; the majesty Of perfect womanhood. No opening bud Of beauty, but the full consummate flower Was hers; and from her mild large eyes looked forth Gentle command, and motherhood, and home, And pure affection. Awe and reverence O'erspread me, as I knew my eyes had looked On sovereign Her√©, mother of the gods. She, with clear, rounded utterance, sweet and calm: ‚ÄúI know the charm of stainless Innocence; I know Love's fruit is good and fair to see And taste, if any gain it, and I know How brief Youth's Passion-tide, which when it ebbs Leaves Life athirst for Knowledge, and I know How fair the realm of Mind, where the keen soul Yearning to rise, wings its impetuous way Beyond the bounds of Thought; and yet there is A higher bliss than theirs, which best befits A mortal life, compact of Body and Soul, And therefore double-natured‚Äîa calm path Which lies before the feet, thro' common ways And undistinguished crowds of toiling men, And yet is hard to tread, tho' seeming smooth, And yet, tho' level, finds a worthier crown. For Knowledge is a steep which few may climb, While Duty is a path which all may tread. And if the goal of Life and Thought be this, How best to speed the mighty scheme, which still Fares onward day by day‚Äîthe Life of the World, Which is the sum of petty lives, that wane And die so this may live‚Äîhow then shall each Of that great multitude of faithful souls Who walk not on the heights, fulfil himself, But by the duteous Life which looks not forth Beyond its narrow sphere, and finds its work, And works it out; content, this done, to fall And perish, if Fate will, so the great Scheme Goes onward? Wherefore am I Queen in Heaven And Earth, whose realm is Duty, bearing rule More constant and more wide than those whose words Thou heardest last. Mine are the striving souls Of fathers plodding day by day obscure And unrewarded, save of their own hearts, Mid wranglings of the Forum or the mart; Who long for joys of Thought, and yet must toil Unmurmuring thro' dull lives from youth to age; Who haply might have worn instead the crown Of Honour and of Fame: mine the fair mothers Who, for the love of children and of home, Tho' passion dies, expend their careful years In loving labour sweetened by the sense Of Duty: mine the statesman who toils on Thro' vigilant nights and days, guiding his State, Yet finds no gratitude; and those white souls Who give themselves for others all their years In trivial tasks of Pity. The fine growths Of Man and Time are mine, and spend themselves For me and for the mystical End which lies Beyond their gaze and mine, and yet is good, Tho' hidden from men and gods. For as the flower Of the tiger-lily gay with varied hues Is for a day, then fades and leaves behind Fairness nor fruit, while the green tiny tuft Swells to the purple of the clustering grape Or golden waves of wheat; so lives of men Which show most splendid, fade and are deceased And leave no trace; while those, unmarked, unseen, Which no man recks of, rear the stately tree Of Knowledge, not for itself sought out, but found In the dusty ways of life‚Äîafairer growth Than springs in cloistered shades; and from the sum Of Duty, blooms sweeter and more divine The fair ideal of the Race, than crowns The glittering gains of Learning. Life, full life, Full-flowered, full-fruited, reared from homely earth, Rooted in duty, and thro' long calm years Bearing its load of healthful energies; Stretching its arms on all sides; fed with dews Of cheerful sacrifice, and clouds of care, And rain of useful tears; warmed by the sun Of calm affection, till it breathes itself In perfume to the heavens‚Äîthis is the prize I hold most dear, more precious than the fruit Of Knowledge or of Love.‚Äù The goddess ceased As dies some gracious harmony, the child Of wedded themes which single and alone Were discords, but united breathe a sound Sweet as the sounds of heaven. And then stood forth The last of the gods I saw, the first in place And dignity and beauty, the young god Who grows not old, the Light of Heaven and Earth, The Worker from afar, who darts the fire Of inspiration on the bard and bathes The world in hues of heaven‚Äîthe golden link Between High God and Man. With a sweet voice Whose every note was perfect melody‚Äî The melody has fled, the words remain‚Äî Apollo sang: ‚ÄúI know how fair the face Of Purity; I know the treasure of Strength; I know the charm of Love, the calmer grace Of Wisdom and of Duteous well-spent lives: And yet there is a loftier height than these. There is a Height higher than mortal thought; There is a Love warmer than mortal love; There is a Life which, taking not its hues From Earth or earthly things, grows white and pure And higher than the petty cares of men, And is a blessed life and glorified. Oh, fair young souls, strain upward, upward still, Even to the heavenly source of Purity! Brave hearts, bear on and suffer! Strike for right, Strong arms, and hew down wrong! The world hath need Of all of you‚Äîthe sensual, wrongful world! Hath need of you, and of thee too, fair Love. Oh, lovers, cling together! the old world Is full of Hate. Sweeten it; draw in one Two separate chords of Life; and from the bond Of twin souls lost in Harmony create A Fair God dwelling with you‚ÄîLove, the Lord! Waft yourselves, yearning souls, upon the stars; Sow yourselves on the wandering winds of space; Watch patient all your days, if your eyes take Some dim, cold ray of Knowledge. The dull world Hath need of you‚Äîthe purblind, slothful world! Live on, brave lives, chained to the narrow round Of Duty; live, expend yourselves, and make The orb of Being wheel on steadfastly Upon its path‚Äîthe Lord of Life alone Knows to what goal of Good; work on, live on: And yet there is a higher work than yours. To have looked upon the face of the Unknown And Perfect Beauty. To have heard the voice Of Godhead in the winds and in the seas. To have known Him in the circling of the suns, And in the changeful fates and lives of men. To be fulfilled with Godhead as a cup Filled with a precious essence, till the hand On marble or on canvas falling, leaves Celestial traces, or from reed or string Draws out faint echoes of the voice Divine That bring God nearer to a faithless world. Or, higher still and fairer and more blest, To be His seer, His prophet; to be the voice Of the Ineffable Word; to be the glass Of the Creative Light, and bring them down To bless the earth, set in a shrine of Song. For Knowledge is a barren tree and bare, Bereft of God, and Duty but a word, And Strength but Tyranny, and Love, Desire, And Purity a folly; and the Soul, Which brings down God to Man, the Light to the world; He is the Maker, and is blest, is blest!‚Äù He ended, and I felt my soul grow faint With too much sweetness. In a mist of grace They faded, that bright company, and seemed To melt into each other and shape themselves Into new forms, and those fair goddesses Blent in a perfect woman‚Äîall the calm High motherhood of Her√©, the sweet smile Of Cypris, fair Athen√©'s earnest eyes, And the young purity of Artemis, Blent in a perfect woman; and in her arms, Fused by some cosmic interlacing curves Of Beauty into a new Innocence, A child with eyes divine, a little child, A little child‚Äîno more. And those great gods Of Power and Beauty left a heavenly form Strong not to act but suffer; fair and meek, Not proud and eager; with soft eyes of grace, Not bold with joyous youth; and for the fire Of song, and for the happy careless life, A sorrowful pilgrimage‚Äîchanged, yet the same, Only Diviner far; and bearing higher The Life God-lighted and the Sacrifice. And when these faded wholly, at my side, Tho' hidden before by those too-radiant forms, I was aware once more of her, my guide Psyche, who had not left me, floating near On golden wings; and all the plains of heaven Were left to us, me and my soul alone. Then when my thought revived again, I said Whispering, ‚ÄúBut Zeus I saw not, the prime Source And Sire of all the gods.‚Äù And she, bent low With downcast eyes: ‚ÄúNay. Thou hast seen of Him All that thine eyes can bear, in those fair forms Which are but parts of Him and are indeed Attributes of the Substance which supports The Universe of Things‚Äîthe Soul of the World, The Stream which flows Eternal, from no Source Into no Sea. His Purity, His Strength, His Love, His Knowledge, His unchanging rule Of Duty, thou hast seen, only a part And not the whole, being a finite mind Too weak for infinite thought; nor, couldst thou see All of Him visible to mortal sight, Wouldst thou see all His essence, since the gods‚Äî Glorified essences of Human mould, Who are but Zeus made visible to men‚Äî See Him not wholly, only some thin edge And halo of His glory; nor know they What vast and unsuspected Universes Lie beyond thought, where yet He rules, like those Vast Suns we cannot see, round which our Sun Moves with his system, or those darker still Which not even thus we know, but yet exist Tho' no eye marks, nor thought itself, and lurk In the awful Depths of Space; or that which is Not orbed as yet, but indiscrete, confused, Sown thro' the void‚Äîthe faintest gleam of light Which sets itself to Be. And yet He lives There too, and rules, none seeing. But sometimes To this our heaven, which is so like to earth But nearer to Him, for awhile He shows Some gleam of His own brightness, and methinks It cometh soon; but thou, if thou shouldst gaze, Thy Life will rush to His‚Äîthe tiny spark Absorbed in that full blaze‚Äîand what there is Of mortal fall from thee.‚Äù But I: ‚ÄúOh, soul, What holdeth Life more precious than to know The Giver and to die?‚Äù Then she: ‚ÄúBehold! Look upward and adore.‚Äù And with the word, Unhasting, undelaying, gradual, sure, The floating cloud which clothed the hidden peak Rose slow in awful silence, laying bare Spire after rocky spire, snow after snow, Whiter and yet more dreadful, till at last It left the summit clear. Then with a bound, In the twinkling of an eye, in the flash of a thought, I knew an Awful Effluence of Light, Formless, Ineffable, Perfect, burst on me And flood my being round, and draw my life Into itself. I saw my guide bent down Prostrate, her wings before her face; and then No more. But when I woke from my long trance Behold, it was no longer Tartarus, Nor Hades, nor Olympus, but the bare And unideal aspect of the fields Which Spring not yet had kissed‚Äîthe strange old Earth So far more fabulous now than in the days When Man was young, nor yet the mystery Of Time and Fate transformed it. From the hills, The long night fled at last, the unclouded sun, The dear, fair sun, leapt upward swift, and smote My sight with rays of gold, and pierced my brain With too much light ere my entranc√®d eyes Could hide themselves. And I was on the Earth Dreaming the dream of Life again, as late I dreamed the dream of Death. Another day Dawned on the race of men; another world; New heavens, and new earth. And as I went Across the lightening fields, upon a bank I saw a single snowdrop glance, and bring Promise of Spring; and keeping my old thought In the old fair Hellenic vesture dressed, I felt myself a ghost, and seemed to be Now fair Adonis hasting to the arms Of his lost love‚Äînow sad Persephone Restored to mother earth‚Äîor that high shade Orpheus, who gave up heaven to save his love, And is rewarded‚Äîor young Marsyas, Who spent his youth and life for song, and yet Was happy though in torture‚Äîor the fair And dreaming youth I saw, who still awaits, Hopeful, the unveiling heaven, when he shall see His fair ideal love. The birds sang blithe; There came a tinkling from the waking fold; And on the hillside from the cot a girl Tripped singing with her pitcher. All the sounds And thoughts which still are beautiful‚ÄîYouth, Song, Dawn, Spring, Renewal‚Äîand my soul was glad Of all the freshness, and I felt again The youth and spring-tide of the world, and thought, Which feigned those fair and gracious fantasies. For every dawn that breaks brings a new world. And every budding bosom a new life; These fair tales, which we know so beautiful, Show only finer than our lives to-day Because their voice was clearer, and they found A sacred bard to sing them. We are pent, Who sing to-day, by all the garnered wealth Of ages of past song. We have no more The world to choose from, who, where'er we turn, Tread through old thoughts and fair. Yet must we sing‚Äî We have no choice; and if more hard the toil In noon, when all is clear, than in the fresh White mists of early morn, yet do we find Achievement its own guerdon, and at last The rounder song of manhood grows more sweet Than the high note of youth. For Age, long Age! Nought else divides us from the fresh young days Which men call ancient; seeing that we in turn Shall one day be Time's ancients, and inspire The wiser, higher race, which yet shall sing Because to sing is human, and high thought Grows rhythmic ere its close. Nought else there is But that weird beat of Time, which doth disjoin To-day from Hellas. How should any hold Those precious scriptures only old-world tales Of strange impossible torments and false gods; Of men and monsters in some brainless dream, Coherent, yet unmeaning, linked together By some false skein of song? Nay! evermore, All things and thoughts, both new and old, are writ Upon the unchanging human heart and soul. Has Passion still no prisoners? Pine there now No lives which fierce Love, sinking into Lust, Has drowned at last in tears and blood‚Äîplunged down To the blackest depths of Hell? Have not strong Will And high Ambition rotted into Greed And Wrong, for any, as of old, and whelmed The struggling soul in ruin? Hell lies near Around us as does Heaven, and in the World, Which is our Hades, still the chequered souls Compact of good and ill‚Äînot all accurst Nor altogether blest‚Äîa few brief years Travel the little journey of their lives, They know not to what end. The weary woman Sunk deep in ease and sated with her life, Much loved and yet unloving, pines to-day As Helen; still the poet strives and sings, And hears Apollo's music, and grows dumb, And suffers, yet is happy; still the young Fond dreamer seeks his high ideal love, And finds her name is Death; still doth the fair And innocent life, bound naked to the rock, Redeem the race; still the gay tempter goes And leaves his victim, stone; still common pain Binds souls with closer links of nobler love, Than Death itself can sever; still the sight Of too great beauty blinds us, and we lose The sense of earthly splendours, gaining Heaven. And still the skies are opened as of old To the entranc√®d gaze, ay, nearer far And brighter than of yore; and Might is there, And Infinite Purity is there, and high Eternal Wisdom, and the calm clear face Of Duty, and a higher, stronger Love And Light in one, and a new, reverend Name, Greater than any and combining all; And over all, veiled with a veil of cloud, God set far off, too bright for mortal eyes. And always, always, with each soul that comes And goes, comes that fair form which was my guide, Hovering, with golden wings and eyes divine, Above the bed of birth, the bed of death, Still breathing heavenly airs of deathless love. For while a youth is lost in soaring thought, And while a maid grows sweet and beautiful, And while a spring-tide coming lights the earth, And while a child, and while a flower is born, And while one wrong cries for redress and finds A soul to answer, still the world is young! GWEN. PROLOGUE. Not of old time alone Was Life a scene of hopes and fears, High joys and bitter tears; Nor Chance nor Fate are done; Nor from our fuller Day The fabled gods have wholly fled away; The World and Man to-day are young As when blind Homer sung. What if the old forms change? They were but forms, the things remain. What if our fear and pain Show not like monsters strange? The self-same path of life We tread, who fare beneath the sun to-day; We sink or triumph in the strife No otherwise than they. Compact of good and ill Their life of old was, as is ours; The same mysterious Will Controlled their finite powers And to strange thoughts of Fate And workings of a fixed Necessity Which rules both small and great. As they bowed, so bow we. And Love, the Lord and King‚Äî Not Eros, but diviner far‚Äî Still upon heavenward wing Mounts like a shining star. Than clouds and thunders stronger, He brings a clear ray from the invisible Sun; And when he shines no longer, Life's play is done. ACT I. SCENE I.‚ÄîHenry. The sweet cold air of these untrodden hills Breathes gently. From the bustle of the inn I turn refreshed to this free mountainside, And listen to the innumerable sound Of the loud brook beneath, which roars and spumes Brown-white against the granite. These thick firs Shed balm upon the evening air; there comes No footstep but the rabbit's or the shrew's Upon this grassy path, which winds and winds Around the hill-side, under promontories Of gold and purple, to the grey old church, Where, chancing yesterday at eve, I caught The sound of hymns, richer and fuller far Than those of yore; and, hidden within the porch, Heard the prayers rising in a tongue unknown, But musical as Greek; and not unmoved Watched the loud preacher, firing with his theme, Grow rhythmic, and the answering moans which showed He touched the peasant heart. Ah, it was long Since I had heard men pray. I have seen the cloud Of incense rolling to the fretted roofs Of dim cathedrals in the fair old lands Where Faith weds not with Reason; I have heard The Benediction service, pure and sweet, Lit by young voices; I have watched with fear In college aisles the polished, delicate priest Poise his smooth periods on the razor edge Of a too fine-drawn logic; I have stood And listened all unmoved, or all ashamed That I was moved a little, by the trick And artifice of speech which, though I knew it, Could cheat the heart a moment, while the preacher Enchained his ignorant thousands. None of these Moved me as that unknown tongue yesterday. I thought my faith reviving. Tush! what folly! That died long years ago from the roots, dried up By the strong glare of knowledge, nor could aught Of all the miracles the Churchmen feign E'er water it to life. That died long since, Struck dead by German learning and the strong And arrogant Priests of Science. Yet god knows‚Äî If God there be‚ÄîI would give my life to know The strong Belief of old, when little hands Were folded morn and eve, and little eyes Scarce open from the night, or half weighed down By the long hours of play, were raised to see Heaven in a mother's gaze. I would my soul Might cast from it the dead unlovely load Of dead men's speculations, rottennesses Born of unloving lives which took the cell And cloister for the home, the midnight lamp For the glow of the hearth, and palsied limbs of doubt For the strong sire's firm stride. I am young still; Yet often, when the flash of racing oars, The shouts, the rushing feet, the joyous din, Floated along the avenues at eve To my still college chamber; there would come A weariness, a surfeit, a distaste Of all the painted show which men call life, Of all the sensual flush which men call love, Of all the hollow, vain logomachies Men take for learning, and I seemed to live In premature decay, and to have touched The fruit of life with eager lips and found it Crumble away in dust. And yet I know How little 'tis my few laborious years Have given me of learning that might take The utmost space of our allotted years, Yet leave us still unquenched. And yet what bar‚Äî But seven little years‚Äîcomes there that parts Me and my boyhood? Seven fleeting years! And still I am a youth in frame, in mind, In innocence of harm in thought or deed, In scorn of wrong, and of the sensual stye Wherein the boor lies bound. Only some power There is which holds me fast and binds my will; Only some dim and paralyzing force Freezes the springs of action, till I lie Moored in some tideless and forgotten creek, A ship which lies and rots; while on high seas The salt winds blow, the white crests break, the sail, Filled with the stress of hope and youth and act, Speeds to the unseen harbour. What shall cure This sickness of the soul? I would that I Were like that peasant lad whom yestereve I saw‚Äîa stalwart boy, on whose red cheek The down of manhood showed; whose strong arm wound Around his sweetheart's waist, as free from shame, While down the village street they loitered slow As 'twere the end of life to grow and breed And die, as do his herds. Yet here again I hesitate to act, because I know What love is in its cause, what in its end, And by what secret, miry paths full oft The winged god steals, when all his violet plumes Are smirched with foulness, and his fair eyes droop, Cloyed with the grosser sweets of lower earth, And the keen arrow flies not through the skies, But drops a blunted shaft. I would I knew Less, or grew wiser, knowing. Golden hair, Sweet eyes, the lithe young form, the girlish voice Which issues forth so soft from the red lips Arched like the bow of Cupid, the soft neck Like a white pillar; these were charms enow I warrant, which might draw as by a spell The rustic youth around. Yes, she was fair And sweet to see, and better, from her eyes A pure young soul looked forth, which was well housed Within so pure a body.‚Äî‚ÄúGwen‚Äù he called her‚Äî 'Tis a fair name‚Äîwhen by the vicarage gate Her father stayed a moment courteously To greet the stranger, and her shy glance turned And met my tell-tale eyes. Surely a man Who had seen the hollowness of things might here Dwell not unhappy‚Äîpurple hills around, And great tranquillity‚Äîa wife's sweet smile Beside him; little hands to draw him back To the kindly earth; and all the healthy load Of daily liturgies which make a heaven Of earth, and doubt a madness. Tush! what folly Is this? Have I not passed these things and spurned The weakness from me‚ÄîI, who have given years Of youth to learning, and am tired a while Of my mistress, nothing more? And yet, what hope Was it that brought me hither, this last night I spend among the mountains? Was it to watch The sunset glories smite the golden sea, Or hear the fairy rivulet fall in foam Among the pines? Or was it that I thought Perchance a slender form might pass this way, Crowned with the crown of youth, and a sweet voice Answer my eager greeting? Oh, what fools And hypocrites are we, when a strong Power Within us, unsuspected, binds us fast And guides our footsteps! It was not the face Of outward nature, but the secret spring Which sets our Being to a hidden end, And bears the name of Love. A gleam of blue, A hat white-plumed‚Äîthere is no other form As graceful; it is she! I may not love, Who cannot wed. I shall not see her more. I am young still; I will but look a moment In those young eyes, and hear that sweet young voice Refine our common English, and tomorrow She will forget the stranger who was kind, And I the mountain-nymph who was so fair. SCENE II. I know not why my books, The learning that I loved, the charm of art Should for a young girl's looks Fade from my thought and vanish and depart. It was but yesterday I loved to pore upon the classic page From morn to eve, nor could the damsels gay, Who from the parching town Flock to these pure cool heights, move me at all. 'Twas rest enough to roam On the hill-side contented all day long, And watch the shadows come O'er moor and hill and purple wastes of sea; To see the evening fall On breathless hill and dale, till suddenly The pale moon rose; then wander homeward slow To my loved books with cheek with health aglow. And now nor hill, nor dale nor sea, Nor the old task sufficeth me. For two days since, ere night could fall, There came a young girl eighteen summers old‚Äî A simple girl, half peasant, lithe and tall, With deep-blue eyes and hair of gold; And straightway my philosophy, My learning, all forsaking me, Left me a love-sick boy‚Äîno more‚Äî Me who have drunk so deep of wiser lore! Too wise, I thought, to rest content With any childish blandishment; Too wise! ah fool! for looking in such eyes, 'Twere folly to be wise. For as she tripped round the hill To visit some cottage lowly, With her basket of food on her arm, She showed like Artemis holy; And I doffed to her, and she knew The stranger of yesternight, And her soft eyes showed more blue As the rose on her cheek grew bright; And, some power impelling me, I‚Äî I who was always counted so shy‚Äî I walked by her side a little, though I know That my tongue was tied and my brain was slow; But however it was, yet her eyes were blue, And her roses all aglow. And I walked by her side till she came To the cottage door, where we parted, And a mingling of pride and of shame Rose and left me awhile half-hearted. I to stoop to a simple girl, The child of a peasant sire! Though the gown of the clergyman hides many faults, Surely 'twas mine to aspire. What would they say‚Äîmy friends, The pale students, polished and proud, If I, the first of them, stooped to take A wife from the vulgar crowd? Or she, my dear mother, whose pride Lies hid so deep in the depths of her heart, There is scarcely one of us knows it is there? Or my father, the Earl, to whom life is no more Than a long procession of hound and horse, To whom hardly dishonour itself seems worse Than to wed out of one's degree? And I wandered out over the hill For an hour of doubt or more, And then, so it happened, my feet drew near To that humble cottage door; And I saw her come forth with a child on her arm, Pale-faced and hollow-eyed, And she seemed a pagan goddess no more, But a fair Madonna, with all the charm Of San Sisto or of the Chair. And then, as over the hill We walked back again, though her voice was still, Surely was never a man so full Of chattering talk as I. But she was not angry at all, not she; But from that calm vantage of wise eighteen And with only a modest word or so, And a sweet voice, and musical accent low, She would bend her delicate car to me, And listen, as grave and as calm as a queen, To the talk which meant little enough, maybe, But was understood, I ween. But however it was, I know When we came to the gate, and her little hand Slid shyly out, as she wished me good-bye, That as I turned to go My feet seemed winged on the slope of the hills, And I hardly knew that the cold half-sleet Which blots the clouded mountain and chills The unsheltered wayfarer, wrapping me round, Had drenched me. For up the silent street Of the darkling village, jubilant sound Compassed me; sunlight beamed on me still; And even to my high inn-chamber I seemed To be treading that breezy hill. What is the charm that wakes The bud, the flower, the fruit, from the cold ground? What is the power that makes With song the groves, with song the fields, resound? One spell there is, so strong to move; Some call it Spring, and others Love. I thought my heart lay dead‚Äî Sad heart, long buried deep in dusty lore!‚Äî But now, the winter fled, It beats with quicker beat than e'er before.‚Äî A simple girl, yet can she move Spring in my soul, the Spring of Love! Strange fable that they taught Of old, of souls divided as in twain, Each by the other sought Until the sundered reunite again, And then the severed members move, Knit by the magic spell of Love! Ah, let us be at one, Dear soul, if one we be, and are of kin Before the world begun; Sure 'tis that I was made thy soul to win. Ah, child, if we might up ward move, Borne on the golden wings of Love! SCENE III. What is it the village leech Tells me of fever and chill, And bids me keep warm? Well, perhaps it were wise; For I fail to sleep, and my limbs are as lead, And a ceaseless throbbing distracts my head, And they warned me of this, I remember, again and again. But surely I know that, came wind or rain, If only my weary limbs could reach To that little gate on the breezy hill And I saw the desire of my eyes, I should take little thought of myself, not I, Not even were I doomed to die. SCENE IV. What is this? And where am I? This is not the high inn-chamber, I know, This white little room where the sunset-glow On the white bed-curtains, as I lie, Makes orange shadows which fade and fleet; Nor are these my first nurse's reluctant feet Which steal so lightly and daintily round, As if grudging the faintest ghost of a sound; Nor was the soft voice I heard Last night, when the curtain was silently stirred, The village doctor's at all: I have heard it before, but when, I cannot recall. For there comes a sense on my brain Of time that is gone but has left no trace But days which passed and left nothing behind, Yet upon the secret depths of the mind Deep graven that nought may erase. As the patient metal retains the sound Of the living voice that is dead, Even so doth my being retain A long procession of days and nights, Weary and suffering and heavily sped; And then for a moment the cool air strikes, As some one carries me tenderly down, And slowly the wheels of my litter climb, Leaving the streets of the little town, Up the hill through the scented pines. And then all is blank for a time; A long time, surely, when nothing came But wandering dreams and a whispered name, Repeated often and like a charm, To keep off fancied phantoms of harm. ‚ÄúGwen,‚Äù was it? Somewhere I seem to recall, Far away in some world of forgotten things, A fair young face which I loved to see; And one night in this room it smiled on me, And the ghastly shapes spread their horrible wings And left me at rest for a while. Ah, no! I did not dream it at all, For now for a week she comes every day, A young nurse, virginal, white, and tall, And her father, the vicar, whose kind eyes beam With a genial kindness he cannot speak; For if ever he ventures a word, it is gall To one who is peevish and weak, And his words struggle out like stones in a stream, Jerked together, and jostled, and battered away, Till I long that he had done. But she, my Artemis pure and fair, My Madonna, who stood at the cottage gate‚Äî She is perfect, I hold, from the crown of her hair To the dainty sole of her delicate foot; And her hand and her voice are as soft as silk, And she comes hour by hour with a tender care, With my draught or my food, or with rich cool milk. Ah! if only‚Äî What, am I then worse than the brute, That I stoop to thoughts that I loathe and hate‚Äî I, a great peer's only son? For I see on the walls of my simple room, Which I know was her own, the work of her hand, At night, in the firelight's flickering gloom, This text emblazoned in letters of gold‚Äî ‚ÄúFor whom Christ di√®d.‚Äù Ah, if indeed His words were the words of a real doom, And his faith the faith of a living creed! But now souls and beliefs are bargained and sold, There is no belief by which men may stand, There is neither creed nor God! But whether there be or be not indeed, It shall not change me nor move my mind. Shall I who hate to see weak things bleed, From the hare which shrieks, to the trout on the hook, Play false with the simple heart of a maid, Till her poor soul pines with a terrible need? I dare not do it; I am afraid To see the young soul, with a hopeless look, Go out for the truth which it cannot find By dark ways, of truth untrod. She shall keep unassailed her young innocent heart, For aught to be whispered by me or done; She shall hold her faith; but 'tis best we part, For hearts break daily and white lives fade, And 'twere better indeed I had never been born, Than to bring a young life to sorrow and woe, And leave a pure saint to the cold world's scorn, Shrinking back from the wreck which myself had made. No, of all the wrong-doing beneath the sun, Not this one be mine, oh God! White room! white curtain! little bed That once was hers, whereon she lay So warm and still, her sunny head Safe pillowed till the growing day! I bless you and I love you all. I feel so young who once seemed old. I see a lithe girl-figure, tall, With grave blue eyes and hair of gold, Stand by the half-closed door when he, The village doctor, yesternight, Came stealthily and looked on me, With noiseless step and shaded light; And I, who deep in lethargy Seemed buried, to a careless eye, Lay all unmoved, till suddenly I caught the echo of a sigh, And, looking up, beheld my dear, The first love of my weary heart, Stand pitiful, and marked the tear In the soft eye unbidden start. Yet no prognostics dire they were He launched against me; only these: Torpor and weakness, needing care And watchfulness for remedies; And, seeing that I saw and heard, Turned to me with a cheerful face, And spoke some random hopeful word, And nodded smiling to the place, Where stood the stair. But I, I knew A sudden rush of hope and strength, And cared not when, if but at length, My new-born thought should turn out true. SCENE V. Oh, joy! I grow stronger day by day; And day by day in the sweet summer weather I wander over the hills, and away High up 'mid the purple masses of heather, Till mounting aloft with no one by, All in the bountiful summer weather, I drink in new life from every pore, Throbbing and bourgeoning more and more In every limb and with every breath, As, laid on the heather, I watch the sky And the purple shadows on sea and hill, And hear no sound but the bee's deep hum, And watch the shy mountain-sheep timidly come, And the kestrel circling, aloft on the rocky brow, Fulfilling the marvellous mission of Death and of Pain. Death! ah, but that is far from me now, Vanished with Pain and its legions of Ill. I can walk with my limbs, I can leap, I can run; I rejoice in my strength: the day of weakness is done. I live, I grow strong; I am one with the World and with Life again. And sometimes, rare blessing, there comes with me A fair young Mountain-nymph over the hill, Fearless and free from a thought of ill. For her mother, who came of gentler blood, Who was always delicate, kind, and good‚Äî Her mother died long ago, and she Has lived from her childhood fearless and free. I think no touch of passion as yet Has moved her. Only pity made wet Her eyes on that night which awoke my love. I am only a friend more mature and wise Than any she knows, and a shamed surprise Would wake in the sapphire depths of her eyes, If she saw what blind and passionate longings move Within the hidden thoughts of a man. Ah, well! but nature is twofold, and sure It were not wise to ban The instincts which are neither gross nor pure. Let him suppress them who can, It is only in thought I invade her virginal peace, For I know that this sweet rehearsal of love must cease, For I am not my own; but my wife to be, Stately and beautiful, waits for me With that which suffices to build up our shattered wealth. Ay, but what if love, awaking and coming by stealth, Should bind me in chains on this wild Welsh hill? Or hurry me downward, downward, to fathomless ill? Tush! how should I be a devil if there be nota God? I am only a young man in whom the young blood Pulses quickly, and have I no gratitude For the life which she saved, the life which is grown so sweet, As we roam o'er these breeze-swept uplands with rapid young feet? Oh, joy! I am one with the life of the hills, and the skies, and of man! SCENE VI. It is done! I have told her I love her, Yester-eve as we walked together, Some power grown tyrannous holding me fast, Blotting alike the Future and Past; And for answer she gave but a sigh and a start, And a blush as bright as the purple heather, And a little flutter of bosom and heart, And a glow like the hues of the sunset above her. Oh, fair ash-grove where I told my love! Fair ash-grove dear to Cymric verse Since their bard who sang thee when Chaucer was young! Fairest of groves that were ever sung! Oh, fairest sunset of all that have shone Since man first woke in Paradise garden, Before the temptation, the ruin, the curse, Before the strange story was over and done, And man an outcast hopeless of pardon! As we sat on the mossy bank, she and I, And no creature was hear with intrusive eye, To mark our innocent joy! Sweet day when love awakens and stands, With his free limbs bare and his outstretched hands, Before two young shame-fast natures which yearn With innocent yearning: clear fires that burn Free from all baser alloy. It is done; it is over; and never Eve, The mother of maidens who love and grieve, Looked fairer than did Gwen, This peasant maiden, when first she heard The one ineffable, passionate word Which stirs for ever the hearts of maidens and of men. The bud on the bough, The song of the bird, The blue river-reaches By soft breez a stirred; Oh, soul, and hast thou found again thy treasure? Oh, world, and art thou once more filled with pleasure! Oh, world, hast thou passed Thy sad winter again? Oh, soul, hast thou cast Thy dull vesture of pain? Oh! winter, sad wert thou and full of sorrow; Oh soul, oh world, the summer comes to-morrow! Oh, soul! 'tis love quickens Time's languorous feet; Oh, world! 'tis Spring wakens Thy fair blossoms sweet; Fair world, fair soul, that lie so close together, Each with sad wintry days and fair Spring weather! As on the clear hill-sides we walked together, A gleam of purple passed over the sea, And, glad with the joy of the summer weather, My love turned quickly and looked on me. Ah, the glad summer weather, the fair summer weather! Ah, the purple shadow on hill and sea! And I looked in her eyes as we walked together, And knew the shy secret she fain would hide, And we went hand in hand through the blossoming heather, She who now was my sweetheart, and I by her side; For the shade was the shadow of Love's wing-feather, Which bares, as he rises, the secrets we hide. Now, come cloud or sunshine, come joy or weeping, It can be no longer as 'twas before. Just a shadow of change o'er the soul comes creeping, And farewell to the joyance and freedom of yore; For it crosses Love's face, where he lies a-sleeping, And he soars awaking, nor slumbers more. I have found her! At last, after long wanderings, dull delays, I have found her; And all my life is tuned to joy and praise. I have found her! A myriad-myriad times In man's long history this thing has been; All ages, climes, This daily, hourly miracle have seen A myriad-myriad times; Yet is it new to-day. I have found her, and a new Spring glads my eyes. World, fair and gay As when Eve woke in dewy Paradise, Fade not away! Fade not, oh light, Lighting the eyes of yet another pair, But let my sight Find her as I have found her, pure and fair! Shine, mystic light! Yes, it is sweet to be Awaited, and to know another heart Beats faster for our coming, and to see The blush unbidden start To the fair cheek, and mark young Love's alarms Perturb and make more fair the girlish charms. I am once more A young man with the passions of my kind; I am no pedant, glorying as before In barren realms of mind. The springtide that awakens land and sea, The Spring of Youth and Love, awakens me. It calls, and all my life Answers from its dim depths, ‚ÄúI come, I hear.‚Äù It breaks, it bursts, in sudden hope and strife, And precious chills of fear. It comes with tremulous, furtive thrills which can Strip from me all the Past, and leave me, man. SCENE VII.‚ÄîGwen. Dear hills, dear vales, so calm and bright In dewy dawn, in silvery night! Dear woods and uplands cool and wild, Where yesterday I walked a child, I love you, but I roam no more With all the careless joy of yore. My girlish days are past and done; I know my womanhood begun. What was it one so wise could see In an untutored child like me? What was it? Nay, 'twere sin to prove By earthy tests the ways of love. Whate'er it was, Love's perfect way Is without doubting to obey. I do obey. I lay my soul Low at Love's feet for his control. Farewell, oh paths half hidden in flowers, Trodden by young feet in childish hours; White bed, white room, and girlish home! The hour of Love and Life is come! I shall not watch as yesterday The orange sunset fade to gray, Nor roam unfettered as the bee, A maiden heart and fancy free. I am bound by such a precious chain I may not wander forth again. Oh, bond divine! oh, sweet, sweet chain! Oh, mingling of ecstatic pain! I am a simple girl no more. I would not have it as before. One day of love, one brief, sweet day, And all my past is swept away. Oh, vermeil rose and sweet, Rose with the golden heart of hidden fire, Bear thou my yearning soul to him I love, Bear thou my longing and desire. Glide safe, oh sweet, sweet rose, By fairy-fall and cliff and mimic strand, To where he muses by the sleeping stream, Then eddy to his hand. Drown not, oh vermeil rose, But from thy dewy petals let a tear Fall soft for joy when thou shalt know the touch And presence of my dear. Tell him, oh sweet, sweet rose, That I grow fixed no more, nor flourish now In the sweet maiden garden-ground of old, But severed even as thou. Say from thy golden heart, From virgin folded leaf and odorous breath, That I am his to wear or cast away, His own in life or death. Thy shadow, oh tardy night, Creeps onward by valley and hill, And scarce to my straining sight Show the white road-reaches still. Oh, night, stay now a little, little space, And let me see the light of my beloved's face! My love is late, oh night, And what has kept him away? For I know that he takes not delight In the garish joys of day. Haste, night, dear night, and bring my love to me! What if his footsteps halt and tarry but for thee? Nay, what if his footsteps slide By the swaying bridge of pine, And whirled seaward by the tide Is the loved form I counted mine! Oh, night, dear night that comest yet dost not come, How shall I wait the hour that brings my darling home? Fair star that on the shoulder of yon hill Peepest, a little eye of tranquil night, Come forth. Nor sun nor moon there is to kill Thy ray with broader light. Shine, star of eve that art so bright and clear; Shine, little star, and bring my lover here! My lover! oh, fair word for maid to hear! My lover who was yesterday my friend! Oh, strange we did not know before how near Our stream of life smoothed to its fated end! Shine, star of eve, as Love's self, bright and clear; Shine, little star, and bring my lover here! He comes! I hear the echo of his feet. He comes! I fear to stay, I cannot go. Oh, Love, that thou art shame-fast, bitter-sweet, Mixed with all pain, and conversant with woe! Shine, star of eve, more bright as night draws near; Shine, little star, and bring my lover here! What shall I do for my love, Who is so tender And dear and true, Loving and true and tender, My strength and my defender‚Äî What shall I do? I will cleave unto my love, Who am too lowly For him to take. With a self-surrender holy I will cleave unto him solely; I will give my being wholly For his dear sake. ACT II. SCENE I.‚ÄîHenry. Only a little week Of meetings under the star, Since the blissful evening I dared to speak, Sweet evening that seems so far! And already the cruel post brings me word That my mother the countess, who, far away At a German bath with her ailing lord, Has been dreaming the early autumn away, Returns to-day, and to-morrow will come To take the invalid leisurely home. Ah, mother! I fear that your pride will scorn That your son should mate with a lowly bride, Though a vicar's daughter is well enough born For all but a foolish pride. And I know, moreover, your heart is set On her to whom no word is spoken yet, The lofty heiress who comes to restore Our house to the splendours of yore. Poor mother, your patience was sadly tried By the studious fancies which kept me apart From the London which now seems to hold your heart; And, alas! I hardly know how to face The blank amaze of your haughty gaze, The cold surprise of patrician eyes, As you listen to my disgrace. Disgrace, did I say? Ah! where In all the bewildering town Is any as Gwen is, fair Or comely, or high or pure? Or when did a countess's coronet crown A head with a brighter glory of hair? Or how could titular rank insure A mind and a heart so sweet? They shall not shame me to cheat or beguile My darling, my queen, my treasure, Nor blot from my soul the pure pleasure Of the brief hours that have been. And if indeed I must go for a while, It shall not be for long, but a little while; And then I will haste back again with passionate feet, To bask again in her smile. I must tell her all to-night, sweet to-night, when we meet. SCENE II. I have seen her once again, I have seen her again, my dear. And oh, but parting was a bitter pain! And oh, the ready, child-like tear! I did not know, even I, before, With how immense and ponderous a chain Love binds the girlish heart, and holds it evermore. For I hardly know at all How it came to be, but as we two spoke Of parting and absence her sweet voice broke, And she paled and wavered as if to fall; And 'twas only a ready encircling arm, And lip to lip in a close embrace, That brought back the rose to her troubled face, And recalled the wandering life from its swift alarm. Dear young soul that Fate has given me to hold, And shall I forsake thee, come weal or woe? No, I will not betray thy sweet trustfulness; no, Not for millions of gems and gold. But before I left her and went My way to the inn, while the village street Echoed loud with the rhythmical wheels and feet Of my mother's chariot, we vowed together That, through every change of life's fickle weather, We would cling to each other and never part. And so I, the round of festivities done, And the pheasants killed and the county won, Will steal from my gilded trammels, and come To the Welsh hillside which is now my home, And the child who has my heart. Was ever a girlish heart so fair As Gwen's, or free from earth? She is pure and innocent, I swear, As an infant at the birth. She is full, indeed, of much old-world lore, From the lessons her mother taught her of yore; Mozart's sweet melodies loves to rehearse, And many a tome of for gotten verse; And something of modern letters she knows, And oft in fancy with Elaine goes, As she floats down lifeless to Camelot. But of wrong and evil she knows no jot. She dreams no more of the ways of men, Their deceits, their treacheries, Or of coarse, bold women,‚Äîmy little Gwen, With the clear, deep, trusting eyes‚Äî Than if you should come by some Arctic main, Where a world of ice shuts humanity out; On some simple forgotten colony, Which had never heard of the world or wealth; Or a convent set on a scarp√®d hill. Tush! but they would corrupt each other, no doubt, Or some echo of evil would creep in by stealth. But for Gwen the pure cold stream of her will Flows along the mountain-side, taking no stain, Crystal-clear, reflecting its kindred sky. Was ever a soul so fair? Forget me not, dear soul! Yet wherefore speak The words of freedom, where the thing is not? Forget me not! And yet how poor and weak My prayer, who know that nothing is forgot! Low voice, or kindling eye, or glowing cheek, Forget them not! Forget me only if forgetting prove Oblivion of low aims and earthy thought; Forget the blinder appetites which move Through secret ways, by lower nature taught; Forget them, love! Remember only, with fond memory, The exaltation, the awakened soul, Swift moments strong to bind my heart to thee, Strong tides of passionate faith which scorn control‚Äî In these remember me! Dear child so sweet in maidenhood, How should I doubt, regarding thee, A secret spring of hidden Good, Which rules all things and bids them be? Dear soul, so guileless and so pure, So innocent and free from stain, As 'twere untempted Eve again, I lean upon thee and grow sure. I love no more the barren quest, The doubt I cherished I despise; I am a little while at rest, Seeing the Godhead in thine eyes. Can good be, yet no Giver? Can The stream flow on, yet own no source? From what deep well of hidden Force Flows the diviner stream in man? I know not. Some there is, 'tis clear, A mystery of mysteries. Thy youth has gazed upon it, dear, And bears its image in thine eyes. Yes, God there is. Too far to know, It may be, yet directing all. It is enough; we spring, we grow, We ripen, we decay, we fall, To a great Will. No empty show Of aimless and unmeaning ends Our life is, but the overflow Of a great Spring which always tends To a great Deep. The silver thread Between the Fountain and the Sea We are for ever, quick or dead, And Source and Ending both are He. It is enough‚Äîno more I know; But maybe from thy faithful eyes, Thy trust that knows no chill, thy glow Of meek and daily sacrifice, I may relearn the legend fair I whispered at my mother's knee, And seeing Godhead everywhere, Confess, ‚ÄúAnd this man too was He.‚Äù SCENE III.‚ÄîGwen. Oh, happy days so lately done, And yet removed so far away Before our passion-tide begun And life's young May! Shy early days of sun and showers, When all the paths were hidden in flowers Tender and sweet, And on the mountain-side the year, With girlish change of smile and tear, Tripped with light feet; And by the melting snows the violet came, And on the wolds the crocus like a saffron flame! Daily some song of lonely bird, By tufted field or tasselled grove, From the clear dawn to solemn eve was heard, But few of love. Nay, rather virginal flutings pure and clear, Passionless preludes, ah, how dear! Nor yet upon the nest, The bright-eyed fearless mother sate, Nor yet high in mid-heaven her soaring mate Thrilled his full breast, Nor yet within the white domain of song Love burst with eyes aglow the maiden choir among. But when the fuller summer shone, Soon as the perfumed rose had come, Lo, all the reign of song was done, The birds all dumb; And for the choir which did before rejoice, Low, tuneless accents of an anxious voice Weighed down with care, And dim forebodings marring the high note Which once resounded from the joyous throat So full and fair. I would not lose the love which is so dear, But 'tis oh for the vanished Spring and the lost imperfect year! Oh, soft dove gently cooing To thy mate upon her nest, And hast thou known undoing And deep unrest? Hath any pain of wooing Pierced thy soft breast? Oh, pale flower ever turning To thy great lord the Sun, And dost thou know a yearning Which is never done, For cloudless days returning And June begun? Ah, heart! there is no pleasure As thine, nor grief. Time Future holds the treasure; Time Past, the thief. What power brings this one, measure, Or that, relief? Ah! 'tis not very long Since I was light and free, And of all the burden of pain and wrong No whisper troubled me; But day by day, upon this breeze-swept hill, Far from the too great load of human ill, I dwelt within the sober walls of home, Safe-set, nor heard a sound of outward evil come. It is not that I know, By word or any deed, What depths of misery lie below, What hearts that bleed; But, since I have felt the music of my soul Touched by another's mastering hand, I seem to hear unfathomed oceans roll, As when a child I saw the Atlantic lash the strand. Oh, mother, who art dead So long beneath the grass, Lift up once more, lift thy beloved head When we two pass, And tell me‚Äîtell me if this passionate pain, This longing, this invincible desire For one I know so lately, be the gain To which young maids aspire. Is this to love, to kiss my chain and feel A dominant will to which 'tis joy to kneel? Oh, mother, I am a maid; I am young, I know not men. My great joy makes me shrink and be afraid. It is not now as then When first we walked together on the hill. I take no longer, thought for any soul Of those I loved before and cherish still; I care not for the poor, the blind, the lame; I care not for the organ's solemn roll, Or sabbath prayers and hymns, who am seared as by a flame. Nay, love! how can I doubt thee Who art so dear, Though I pine away without thee In the fading year? The ash flings down its leaf, the heather Is bloomless in the autumn weather; The mountain paths are wet with rime, Where we together eve by eve Would wander in the joyous time, Fair hours when thy returning strength Came with the days' increasing length. I pace alone the dear familiar road Where first we met. I walk alone; I have no aim nor purpose, none‚Äî Only to think of those soft days and still believe. Yester eve, on a distant hill, A wreath of cloud-mist dealing sleet Compassed my homeward steps, as still I toiled with weary feet. Oh, what if the snow, like a winding-sheet, Had stayed the steps of my life and my troubled will, And closed on me for ever, concluding there My little hopes and joys, and maybe my despair! Nay, I will not doubt him nor be afraid; He is all that is good, I know it, tender and true. But I fear he is higher in rank than he said; For one day, I remember it well, as he lay Very weak on his bed, a letter came Coronet-blazoned, and half in shame I lifted my eyes, and he saw I knew, And his face grew troubled and never more Was his gaze as frank as it was before. Tender it was, indeed, and ardent and true, But not as frank as before. But I count the days till he comes again; I long for him with a dull deep pain. I will do whatever thing my love commands; I will go or stay; I am caught as a bird in his hands, Oh, love, my love! tarry not long; I am not happy nor strong. Delay not, love; the sun has lost his fire. Stay not; the cold earth loses warmth and light. Summer is dead, and Winter comes to blight The waiting world's desire. Come back, and coming bring back Spring with thee, Spring for my heart though all the world lie dead; My life will burst in blossom at thy tread‚Äî Oh, love, come back to me! ACT III. SCENE I.‚ÄîHenry. Once more upon these dear familiar hills I tread; 'tis autumn now, 'twas summer then. The valley paths are deep in mire; the leaf Falls sadly from the bough; the village inn, So noisy then, when four months since I lay 'Twixt life and death, is silent; a gray mist Hangs o'er the breathless lowland. All the hills Are clouded, on whose summits a thin cowl Of snowflakes sits at times. Summer is dead; A sad autumnal stillness over all The dull world broods, and in my heart I know Summer is dead‚Äîsweet summer, ah, too brief! For now, alas! I know What folly 'twas that kept me here Three little months ago. I have drunk deep since then of cups that cheer, The sea of eyes, the beat of popular hands, When to his thought the high-set plat-form reels, As now the solitary speaker stands Poised like a swimmer on high waves, who feels The world cut off from him and knows To fail is run. I have known Men better since, and felt how near And yet far off are clown and peer; And known how better than all lore, Better than love itself, and more, How satisfying and how great, It is to aid the ship of state, The labouring bark, which reeling goes 'Mid sunken rocks, and watching foes. And best of all I know How baseless was my sweet Arcadian dream. I could not bear‚ÄîI know it well‚Äî To live retired from the central stream Of life, as if in a hermit's cell. I long for the hurry, the passion, the glow Of full life lived in the eyes of men; I can bear no longer to dream in inglorious ease. A great name, the voice of the people, authority, these Are more than my simple Gwen. Ay, and I have learnt besides, What I scarce suspected before, By what poor expedients my father has striven To keep the wolf from his door‚Äî Bubble schemes, mine-ventures which came to nought, And some senseless bet on some swindling race, And I know not what gambling follies beside. But I know that our lawyer, with long-drawn face, Came to me with secret warnings of ill, And hints that a prudent marriage alone could fill The coffers so nearly empty, again. Poor father! it was not right, for your dreams of gain, And your pompous life and wasteful, orderless state, To diminish a family hoard that was never great; But I know that if the blow he hinted should come, And the Jew and the broker harried our ancient home, It would kill you and drive my mother distraught. Nay, I could not bear to see it. My path is clear: I must see you once more and leave you, my love, my dear. SCENE II. I did not know it, I swear; I did not dream that a young girl, fair and free, Could long care for one grave and studious and worn like me. I thought our brief passion was dead; I thought I had schooled my heart to obey my head; But when I saw her, she showed so fair,‚Äî It was just at the self-same spot where we used to meet,‚Äî That I hastened up the steep path with wings to my feet; And she did not see me at first, but stood for a while Silent and musing and still, with a sweet half-smile, As if bent on some mingled vision of joy and pain, And I knew that our love was not dead, but slept and awoke again. But when at length she turned her eyes, With a beautiful, pitiful look of surprise, And a questing glance, and a shiver and a start, Oh, 'twas then that she touched my heart! And before a moment passes again we stand, With eyes on each other bent, and hand linked to hand; And with hardly a spoken word, we are face to face, Strained together again in a close embrace; And I failed, I failed to tell her what should have been told, For the heart of a maid is higher than rank or gold. But to-night I must speak and tell her all, I must tell her though the sky fall. SCENE III. It is over, it is done. She from the clear frank depths of her maidenly pride: ‚ÄúDear, it is sudden indeed, but I thought it would come, For I doubt if any are happy under the sun. But you, you shall not imperil the pride of your home; I know you a fitting mate for a loftier bride. I will love you and pray for you always. And now good-bye. Be good, my dear, to your wife. But I Have awoke from my dream in time, and will tend My poor, who, I fear, have missed a friend; And my father is growing old, and will want me here. Fear not, I shall not be unhappy. Farewell, my dear!‚Äù And she went with feet as swift as the bounding roe, And vanished before I knew she was minded to go, And left me alone with the dying day in the fading year. I cannot leave her thus; I must see her again, Though I know it is cruel to both and renewal of pain. But all night long have I lain awake, Tossing and fevered for her dear sake, As when she nursed me to life in her little room; And once, when I dozed a moment, I seemed to hear Her sweet voice calling aloud in accents of fear, Calling my name in a voice which sank to a moan; And, though I know it was dreaming fancy alone, I cannot leave her thus. I am harassed with fears; I must see her again; I must write. And lo! through the gloom The slow dawn of autumn breaks in mist and in tears. Dear, I must see you again. Bring with you the last sweet rose Which lingers still in your garden-ground, The last red summer rose. Do you mind how you sent me a rose Along the swift streamlet's flow, A sweet and a blushing rose? It is faded‚Äî'twas long ago. Come, dear. A dream visited me In the weary vigilant night; I heard your voice calling to me In grievous pain and affright. I must see you. The swift wheels stay At the spot we have known of yore; Be there, ere they bear me away From my love for evermore. SCENE IV.‚ÄîGwen. The light has gone out of my life, Yet I will not repine. Nay, 'tis well to have passed betimes through the struggle and strife. Shall I grieve that he comes not again, That my love is not mine? Ah, folly! the whole creation travails in pain. I will live my own life once more; I will succour the weak; I will be but a little more grave than I was before. I will strive to repay the deep love My fond father fails to speak; Though the path may be lonely and drear, yet the heavens are above. Ah! my love who no longer art mine, Yet my love till I die, I will strive to be patient and strong, but I wither and pine. A letter from my love, In the well-remembered hand, Once again, yet we have parted; 'Tis hard to understand. A letter from my love! Dear letter, and what says he? ‚ÄúI am going away for ever. Come once more, dear to me, ‚ÄúAnd with you bring a rose.‚Äù‚Äî My love, I will be there; I will bring you a red, red rosebud Upon your heart to wear. But you must not crush it, dear, Or bind it to you too fast, Or the poor flower's scent, I fear, Will bring back to you the Past. Wear your rose lightly, dear, For ornament or pleasure; But the virgin rose of a maiden's heart Keep safe as a precious treasure. ACT IV. SCENE I.‚ÄîHenry. How weak are we and blind! How ignorant of fate! For I thought I was steadfast and firm, and knew my mind, Till I saw her at the gate; And next day, as soon as the train rolled on and I sat alone, I wished that I had not written to give her pain, And I prayed that she might not come, nor might I see her again. But when the swift wheels slackened and grew still At the little wayside station beyond the hill, There alone by the platform stood my treasure, my dear, Very pale, with a rose in her hand; full of maidenly fear. And I sprang out to her, and we whispered ardent and low, With sad hearts throbbing together and cheeks aglow, For a precious minute or two, till the signal to go; And then, all my youth and my love rising up like a flame, I whispered, ‚ÄúI cannot leave you, my love, my bride. Come to me, my own, my wife!‚Äù And lo! as in a trance, With a shiver and tottering limbs, and a pitiful glance, As one who walked in a dream, she obeyed and came Constrained, and sank fainting down in her place at my side. There she lay long time on my breast, very pale and chill, And I trembled to see her poor white face, my dear; And the swift train had sped us on far, when, with something of fear, She said quickly, ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù And I: ‚ÄúWith your husband to be. We are long miles away from your home. You will trust me, my own?‚Äù And she moaned, ‚ÄúAh! how could I leave my father alone? Poor father! Ah! what will they think of me when they know? They will deem me unmaidenly‚Äîbold. Let me go. We were mad; It is nothing to women to wither and pine and be sad. Let me go. It is better. Some weakness constrained me to come. I will go and be happy, fear not, with my equals at home.‚Äù But I soothed her, and flashed a message that all was well, And to promise a letter next day, telling all that there was to tell; And she lay like a child on my heart, with her head bent wearily down, And lo! on the autumn twilight, the glare and the turmoil of town. I hold him wrong who opens wide The secret, sacred doors of love, The paths by shame-fast footsteps tried, The mazes of the enchanted grove. I hold him wrong; but Gwen the wife Is dearer far than Gwen the maid. We walk by hidden deeps of life, And no man maketh us afraid. I hold him wrong; but who can prize At its full worth the love he gains, Till bound by mutual sacrifice, Till fused by mutual joys and pains? Too happy are the halcyon days; For Time the taker, Time the thief, Steals ghostlike down the flowery ways, And makes the blessed moments brief. I have left her ofttimes for a while, And then, on some pretext hastily found, Have hurried back to bask in her smile; But now I am here fast bound, For my father is failing, day by day, And 'tis hard to keep the harpies at bay, Who would enter and drive him from house and home. They must not suspect that I, who am alone The mainstay on which they depend to secure their own, Am not the lover of one who brings lands and wealth, But bound to a penniless girl whom I wedded by stealth; They must not dream it; and therefore here must I stay, Though I seem indeed to lose every day That keeps me away from my love. Dear soul, it is springtime again, and fresh currents move Through the world, and stir the life in blossom and tree, And the little hidden life which ere long shall be. SCENE II.‚ÄîGwen. Dear love, I will be patient, yet I long to see you, and I fear Lest absence lead you to forget The things that once were dear. You tell me we awhile must hide Our union safe from prying eyes, But when your ailing father dies You will proclaim me as your bride. I long that this might be, nor wait The death of any. I have been These last six months, 'spite love and fate, Dearest, as happy as a queen. But now another dearer life Forbids my careless patience more. Pray God it may not come before I am acknowledged as your wife. I did not know, When I walked careless on the hills, The hopeless load of human ills; But neither could I know To what full height our happiness can grow. Sing, caged bird, sing! Is this your constant strain? ‚ÄúI would, I would that I were free; I would, I would, I would that I were once again Sitting alone within a leafy tree; I would that I might be Breathing free air far from this gilded pain.‚Äù Ah, bird! I would be free As you, for I weary here. And yet, my bird, I have one so dear, so dear, That, if he might only bide with me, I should no longer care To change this stifling, fettered air For the free mountain-breathings fresh and fair. Cold east and drear, Thy chill breath veils the world in cheerless gray. Sad east, while thou art here, Life creeps with halting feet its weary way. I feel you pierce my heart, oh, cold east wind! Sad east! that leavest lifeless plains behind. The dull earth, watching, sleeps Within her leafless bowers, Until the west wind coming weeps Soft tears that turn to flowers. Oh, cruel east! that dost delay the world, Withering the leaf of hope while yet unfurled. Over this gray cheerless town The stifling smoke-mist hangs, a squalid pall, And night, too swift for springtide, settles down Before the shades of mountain-evenings fall. I sicken here alone, dull day by day, To watch the turmoil wake and fade away. Why does my dear not come, Or write or send some little loving word? It is not here as 'twas at home. I have no companion but this prisoned bird; No friend in all the throng to hear my sighs; No glance, but the cold stare of alien eyes. No friend, nor love nor care To hold me; but when summer suns return And wake this stagnant and exhausted air, The little dearer life for which I yearn May wake, and make me happier than of old, Watching the innocent life my arms enfold. Cold east and drear, Spreading a noontide darkness on the town. You shall not blight my faith, nor make me fear, Nor leave me in despond, nor drag me down. I am alone; but, if he loves me still, I am not all alone, sad days and chill. SCENE III. I grieve that my father stays away, Though his letters are always dear and kind, But sometimes I think they seem to convey Some shadow of pain on a doubtful mind; But he does not know that I am alone, For I could not tell him my dear was gone, And it may be he has not forgiven quite Our foolish and hurried flight. What? Do I not know‚Äîforgive, did I say?‚Äî That nought which falls short of committed wrong Would keep his heart from his child for long, Nought that a kiss would not chase away? Dear father! I would I might welcome him here! For, brooding here day by day, My mind grows full of a formless fear, And I dread the glance of the women; the sneer Which I seem to see on their lips and eyes, As they ask sometimes with a hard surprise If my husband is ailing; he keeps away‚Äî And I have but faltering words to say. And to-day I thought, as I sate in my lonely room, With a little frock on my lap, in the gathering gloom, And the woman came with the lights, that she seemed to look With the old respect no more, but a cold rebuke. Does she doubt, then, I am his wife? I will fly; I will go; I will tell her all my secret. Ah, no! ah, no! Great Heaven, does she think he is gone and will no more come? Oh, Henry, 'tis cruel to leave me, come to me, come home! SCENE IV. This is the fourth dull week‚Äî I am wretched and sick at heart‚Äî Since the thought came first which I fear to write or speak, And I have no rest at night; for I suddenly start, Thinking I hear his voice calling to me in pain, Mixed with voices of scorn sometimes, through the dead city-night; And then, if my tired eyes sink to slumber again, I wake in deadly fright. And before the bustle of life revives in the street, I watch for the hurrying sound of the messenger's feet, And I hold my breath as he comes with a sickening fear. But the sharp summons passes on quickly, and never here He stays; but I must not despair, nor ever forget That I live for a ripening life, which 'twould injure to fret. But I know that my face is pale and anxious and thin, Which my love would hardly know, if he saw me again; And I look in the glass, and I start to see therein Two hollow eyes answer my gaze with a look of pain. And perhaps he would love me no more in my beauty's disgrace; Perhaps he was only a slave to a foolish face; Perhaps‚Äî But I know I am sick in body and mind, Or I could not doubt my love, who was always kind. My heart is heavy, My life runs low, My young blood's pulses Beat faint and slow. I cannot believe, Yet I dare not doubt, For when faith is shadowed Love's fire goes out. Oh, Love, what is this That thy strong power brings To those thou hast touched With thy vanishing wings? Oh, Love, it was cruel To bring us to pain. I will hide me away From the cold world again. I can stay here no longer; Whatever may come, I will go to my father And‚Äîdie at home. My heart is heavy, My life runs slow; To my Father in Heaven I open my woe. SCENE V. What is it that has been? Let me once recall again The fear that came upon me, And the story of my pain. Yester-eve, as I sat alone, Somebody entered, and read How the Earl, at some foreign bath, Had been ailing and now was dead; And pointed to the place, And the letters seemed to swim, And the whole room whirling round and round, As my sight grew faint and dim. For 'twas said that the new Earl, His mourning done, would wed The heiress of whom he told me before; And I wished that I was dead. And they muttered, with freezing glances, ‚ÄúThey had thought 'twas thus, before;‚Äù And I could not answer a single word But fell upon the floor. And now I lie ailing and weak, Sick in body and mind and heart; But to-morrow, if God help me, I will rouse me and depart. Oh, father, you will not spurn me, Nor think me what they say, But take us back to your heart and life, And my grief shall fade away. SCENE VI. Oh, the sweet air of the hills, That on this fair summer night Breathes on me as I 'scape at last From the glare of the long day, From the dust of the long plain, And the rushing, maddening train! Here I mount among the pines By the path we knew so well. All is there unchanged but I. Hark! the thunder of the fall. See the ash-grove where we sate. There we lingered at the gate. Nothing changed, but I am changed. Slowly up the well-loved steep, Failing footsteps toiling slow, Where, upon the morning hills, Twelve months since my feet would go Bounding lightly as the roe. None have seen me, that is well‚Äî Yet if here I were to fail‚Äî Courage! I shall reach there‚ÄîNay, I must rest awhile; then climb Slowly through the fragrant gloom, Where my garden roses bloom.‚Äî It is finished. Dear white head Bending low upon thy book, Homely lamp, familiar room, Ye will welcome me, I know. Open, father; I am come Broken-hearted to my home! ACT V. SCENE I.‚ÄîGwen. It is over now. I have been a long time ill, But to-day I am able to wander slow To the churchyard round the hill. 'Tis there they have laid my little love, Who lingered three little months‚Äîit was not long‚Äî And there they will lay me too, ere the waning light grows strong. It is but a little grave Where my little one is laid, But I keep it decked with white flowers every day, And above, a kindly yew's protecting shade Shelters it safe from rain and wind. Sleep fast, my darling, sleep while yet you may; Your mother will not linger long behind. Dear child, I wonder when The last great morning breaks and we shall wake, If I may bear you then Safe in my nursing arms for Him to take; Or will He suffer you to come before, White soul, while I am waiting at the door? Dear little grave, I strew Fresh autumn flowers and garden blooms on you; I strew upon you roses white and red; I fling my heart upon you, narrow bed! Once, twelve months since, I launched my heart, a rose, Where, lit with laughter, Love's sweet river goes, And lo! once more the year's swift pinions move, And now I cast it on the grave of love. My love, my self, my child, Lie buried here, and I am free again. I would I were a slave; I loved my chain. I would that I might see your sweet eyes mild; They were your father's eyes, who loves not me‚Äî I blame him not, but do forgive for thee. It is not long I stay, my life, my dear, Not long until we are together here. Last year‚Äîit seems an age ago‚Äî I had not seen him: then we went Together on our road; and so, By ways and converse innocent, We gained at last the sacred gate Of wedlock, and the hand of Fate Lifted the latch, and we passed in To the enchanted ground therein. And now the winds of autumn rave, And love lies dead within a grave. Dear love, that liest there so still, I go now till to-morrow's sun; The autumn evening gathers chill, The day is well-nigh done. Sleep, dear, through all thy long untroubled night, Sleep calmly till the Light! SCENE II. What? Can a second springtide burst, As happy as the first, From out the midst of dark autumnal days? And can the dead roots start? And can the withered heart Rise upward from despair to joy and praise? Yes, though with thrills of almost pain, They can, again. For as I turned yesterday, sad and slow, From where my darling lies below, Fulfilled with sad sweet thoughts of the things that have been, I saw my dear father's kindly face, As he came to meet me with hurried pace, And a grave smile that told me the news that he bore was good; But he slackened his steps when he saw me, and calmed his mood. And I said, ‚ÄúTell me all.‚Äù And he answered, ‚Äú'Tis well, my dear. He was faithful; I knew it, and is, for his letter is here,‚Äù And he drew it forth; and I knew that the writer was he, And the title was that which he bears, and 'twas meant for me. Then my father kissed my forehead and left me alone, And I sat down to read what he said on a graveyard stone. My love! He too had been ill, for a chill he caught When the Earl lay dying abroad, well-night brought him to nought; Growing to fevered heats and a wandering brain, Till he raved for his nurse of last year to soothe him again; And when, after many days, he had risen to find The wife he was forced to leave, with unquiet mind, He found me not, but they said I had gone to my home. And so, with loving regards, he promised to come, Almost ere his letter could reach me. Oh, love! oh, my dear! I shall see you again, though 'tis late; and, meanwhile, a great fear Rises up lest you grieve for your child whom you never have seen. SCENE III. He has come, he has been; I have kissed him again and again. Ah, God! but it is hard to die, For it was not he was to blame at all, but I. It was I, with my coward distrust and unreasoning fear, Who could not put faith in my love, but shrank back from a sneer. I am glad he was true throughout, though my sentence of doom Sounds clear as I lie alone in my own white room. To-day was a happy day, When, upon my husband's breast, I leant beside the grassy mound Where our firstborn lies at rest. And we mutely went again By the dear old paths once more, And I half forgot my sorrow And the world was as before. And he spoke with cheering words Of the time when I should come To cherish other children In his old ancestral home. Oh, my love as true as steel, With your comfort kindly meant, I would not seek to shadow The light of your content; But a hundred signs assure me, Signs indefinite yet strong, That my fate is wholly written And I linger not for long. Dearest, let us cling together, Heart to heart and eye to eye; Let us be together living, And I shall not fear to die. SCENE IV.‚ÄîHenry. This is the last time that I tread These unforgotten ways, For to-morrow we follow the swallow over the wave. We have spent our Mays; Chill autumn has come and found us bent over a grave, The grave of our youthful love and the hopes that are dead. My dear, she is very pale and worn, Save the brilliant spot that flushes on either cheek; She recalls no longer the breezes and freshness of morn As she leans upon me, slow and weak; But I trust the warm summer sun and the honeyed air, And the daily sights and sounds of things that are fair, May rouse her and lighten her load of care. Dear child! to think of her pining alone, While I lay longing for her and too weak to write, And afraid to disclose by a look or a tone The thing which discovered had wrecked us quite! Ah, me! 'twas a wretched time; and now it is done, My father is gone and my son, and I only remain, Weak in frame, with a fading wife and a burden of pain. Dear soul, I will do what by love and by gold can be done; I will bask with you safe from chill in the southern sun; And I pray that when summer returns and the meadows grow green, You may sit in my stately home, as happy and proud as a queen. But, oh! what a fear is there I dare not speak, As I see the crimson deepen On the pale wan cheek. Nay, love, you are more lovely so, A thousand times more fair, Than when, twelve little months ago, You went so free from care. More dear you are, my love, and sweet, A thousand times more dear, Than when my heart forgot to beat In the springtime of the year. A thousand times more dear, my love, A thousand times more dear, For the tender pity that you move And the anxious boding fear. To-morrow, may it be A new existence that we twain shall prove Upon the western sea, Bound for some happier land of health and love. New hopes, new fears, new pains, New joys; our hearts are ready, and we trust The Omnipotent Will that reigns Lifts not our hopes to dash them in the dust. We hope; we cannot tell; We go together alone, forgetting all; For love, it shall be well, Though life, a waning fire, may sink and fall. Yet, if a prayer may move Thy dread decrees, Omnipotent Will, Spare, spare my innocent love To my fond gaze a little longer still. SCENE V.‚ÄîGwen. Here is a calm bright day, And my husband's tender voice; He has climbed up from the village, And I struggle to rejoice. For I feel that to sorrow longer For the little one who has fled, My angel who rejoices Among the bless√®d dead, Were a morbid grief, displeasing To the Lord of joy and pain. Nay, I will not sorrow longer; I will strive to live again. To the beautiful far countries Where the soft unfailing sun Beams cloudless through the winter, And the flowers are never done, He will take me, undelaying, None beside us, only me, By the ship that leaves to-morrow The great city on the sea; Every morning growing milder, As we southward wing our way, Till our swift ship casts her anchor In some blue unruffled bay. Stately cities I have read of, Naples, Rome in all her pride‚Äî I shall see them, a great lady, With my husband at my side. I shall see them when returning From the sacred stream of Nile, From vast tombs of unknown rulers, And the Sphinx's changeless smile. I shall see them. But in springtime, When the bitter east is done, I shall greet these dear old mountains Shining in the sober sun; I shall see my father smiling; I shall bend once more again O'er my sleeper's flower-strewed cradle, Mingling tender hope with pain. I shall come, though, maybe sooner, When I shall not see nor hear; For my love has given his promise I shall rest beside my dear. Farewell, oh dear, dear hills! I do not know if I shall see you more. Farewell! 'tis set of sun, the night is near. Farewell! Below, the mist of autumn fills The sleeping vale with winding vapours frore, And hides from sight the yellow woods and sere. But on the heights the day's declining fire Bathes all the summits in a haze of gold. Not yet the cold mist, stealing high and higher, Touches the purple glow with fingers cold; Not yet the ruddy light from out the sky Goes, nor the orange shadows fade and die. Here, far above the grave of dying day, The clear night comes, and hills and vales grow dark. But soon the first faint star, a lucid spark, Glimmers; and, lo! the mystical array! A myriad suns for one! strange suns and far, The eternal homes where bless√®d spirits are! Oh! night of Being, like the night or day, How should I fear because your shadows fall? Who knows from what fresh glories thy dark pall For failing vision lifts the veil away? What boundless spiritual orbits rise Before the inward gaze of dying eyes? Farewell, oh little grave, Wherein I leave my buried heart awhile! Thick yew, protect it well until I come; Shelter it; let not winds of winter rave, Nor sharp frosts fret nor snows, nor floods defile. Here is my heart, and here my waiting home. Farewell! farewell! ACT VI. SCENE I.‚ÄîHenry. The sweet cold air of these untrodden hills Breathes gently. Five and twenty years have gone Since here my father trod, young, high in hope, With all the world before him; nor as yet The slow-consuming fire of deep decay Had sapped his youthful hope, and left his life To drag along its crippled journey, spent In southern lands, wherever the chill east Might come not; year by year: and last of all, Since I have grown from boyhood, visiting His country never; cut off and divorced From all the joys that make existence sweet To the aspiring great‚Äîthe fame of men‚Äî The name which every morning's broad sheet takes To the eyes and hearts of millions‚Äîall the thirst For the statesman's high career sated, and lost In a strange lethargy which bound him fast To an inglorious ease. And yet I know A time there was when the more generous part Allured his growing soul. For I have found Among his papers, time-stained notes which tell Of deeper studies far than I have dreamt of; Of high hopes and ambitions; such as fire Those who, as he and I, are placed by Fate On such high vantage that to will alone And labour is enough, and each approach Of honour, the Senate itself, which opens not To lower birth until slow-creeping age Derides the folly, flings back early doors To their unbroken youth. These have I found. And, oh most strange of all! close manuscripts Of sceptical themes‚Äîmy father's, his who was, Of all men I have known, most rapt by faith And very full of Godhead‚Äîdoubts and fears And anxious questionings, changed yet the same, Differing in form alone from those which now At our own Oxford echo through old rooms Filled with young heated disputants, whose minds Seize with a frolic eagerness the doubts Which have perplexed all time. All these I found‚Äî Ah, life is wonderful! We are the sport Of great laws swinging slowly through an arc Immeasurably vast. We doubt our doubts, We hug our faiths, and fancy we are free Who are shut fast of Time. What power it was Froze fast his life I know not, but sometimes I think there must have come upon his life Some overmastering passion, some young love Such as the poets feign, for some young heart, Which held him back and clogged him. Yet I know‚Äî I would stake my life upon it‚Äînaught of wrong Came nigh him. Only hardly love it was That bound him to our mother‚Äîthe high dame He spoke of seldom, mourned seldomer still, Whom scarcely I recall; whose clear cold face Looks from beneath its coronet in my hall, Statelier than any of our line. Poor mother! She left us early‚Äîme and little Gwen; Gwen, whom men know as Lady Gwendoline, Our father's darling, who now comes with me When hither, after years of exile spent From home and homely scenes, we turn and leave The turmoil of the Season and the chase Of selfish worldlings, eager to secure Those who are rich or fair. I had found of late, Mention among his letters here and there Of this Welsh village, where, when he was young, He spent a summer. So we left behind The senseless whirl, and now a week or more In this unclouded weather, bright and fair, Have wandered careless o'er these purple hills, Where once our father, older scarce than I, Roved in that far-off summer. We have kept Our name and rank a secret, and are free To come and go at pleasure, as did he, Dear father, years ago. Ah! sweet and strange, The cycle of a life which turns and turns Round to the self-same spot, changed yet the same; The same but for the mystic beat of Time; The same but for the ineffable change of Being, Which in the same life, grown another, works Infinite depths of change. Somehow‚ÄîI know not If aught it be but fancy‚Äîbut I think The secret of his life, if such there were, Lies hid within these hills; and I remember That day, when he was dying and his breath Came feebler even than wont‚Äîthe unruffled sea Was sapphire, and the orange-groves behind Showed flecked with gold‚Äîwe heard a far-off bell Call from the campanile on the hill, And then he roused himself: ‚ÄúHark! 'tis the bell‚Äî From the dear church-tower on the hill above‚Äî They both are there‚Äî'tis a fair spot‚Äîthe path Is steep from out the village, but the air Is balmy‚Äî'tis the well-remembered bell‚Äî They are singing now in Welsh, and the sound soothes The sleepers by the yew.‚Äù And now they tell me There is indeed a church on yonder hill, A little church half hidden by dark yews, Which looks upon the long green vale and scans The ever-winding river. So my sister, Who learnt in Italy the sketcher's art, Has gone before, armed with all fit devices To snare the fleeting landscape. It is time To join her. I must hasten; it may be (She is not strong, dear sister, but soon tires) She tires of sketching and awaits me. Father, I would that you were with us, and might breathe This sweet cold air again as young as I. SCENE II.‚ÄîGwen. How fair and fresh from this gray churchyard shows The rich green vale beneath, Upon the deep Lush meadows, where the black herds grazing seem Like rooks upon the grass, a silvery gleam, Now lost and now discovered, marks the place Where winds the brimming river. Here, thick woods Of oak and beech upon the sloping banks Bend to the shadowy stream which glides beneath. There, through the emerald meads, shallow or deep, It hastes or loiters, till the tall dark elms, Grouped by the distance, hide it. And above, On either hand the eternal mountains rise, Pine-clad below, upon whose upper heights The unfenced heather purples. All the sky Is flecked with soft white fleecy clouds which cast Bewildering charms of shadow; and beyond, A shining sapphire drawn 'twixt earth and sky, Glitters the summer sea. Most beautiful Thou art, oh motherland, which I have known As yet so little. Beautiful art thou My second mother, sunny Italy, Where the blue heaven is brighter, and the sea Gives back a clearer azure. But for me There grows a tenderer charm from these green fields And purple hills and white-flecked skies, denied To thy more brilliant landscape. Perhaps it is In part because my father loved them well, Dear father whom I loved, and who loved me Closer than might a mother. Well! enough! I will draw no more to-day, but let the scene Sink on my soul, and fix itself, and breed Fresh scenes of beauty to inspire my hand When the short days are dull, and all the sky A gloomy pall, and gusts of wintry rain Beat on the darkling city. I will muse A little till my brother comes, and think How good he was whose memory brings us here; How careless of himself, how prompt to give Whatever good a father's hand can give To his motherless girl. I scarcely had a thought He did not share, and as I think, indeed, He kept no secret from his earliest years Of which I knew not. He has told me all‚Äî His studious youth, his feeble health, the doubt Of God and man which for a while obscured His noble brain and left it impotent‚Äî And somehow it was here, upon these hills, From out this very spot, it may be, gazing On all the loveliness of earth and sky And silver sea, the waters of his soul Were loos√®d, and flowed onward strong and clear, To join the Infinite Deep! There comes a cloud Upon the sky and gusts of sudden wind; The beauty fades, as treacherous as youth, And fleeting, and I thought I heard a roll Of thunder drawing near. I would my brother Were come. I am afraid. The church is closed‚Äî It is not here as 'tis in Italy, Where all who choose may kneel as welcome guests Within God's House; but yon thick yew that stands Above that gleaming cross will shelter me From heavier storms than this. Here I am safe. See with what tender care some loving hand Keeps green the sward, and sets it round with flowers That bloom as in a garden! One red rose Twines round the cross, and sheds in this rude wind Its crimson petals. Two graves stretch beneath, And three sleep under. Ah! 'tis the old vicar's Who lived here forty years and died last year. ‚ÄúAlso‚Äù‚Äîah, see my brother comes at last‚Äî ‚ÄúAlso of‚Äù‚Äîstrange, almost my name‚ÄîGwenllian, His Daughter, who died aged twenty years‚Äù‚Äî The year?‚Äîone year before my father's marriage‚Äî Ah me! these two were parted long, long years! ‚ÄúCountess of‚Äù‚ÄîWhat is this? My father's title! Father, what means it?‚Äî‚ÄúAnd her infant son Henry, Lord‚Äù‚ÄîWhat, my brother's? What is this? It is strange. Quick! I am fainting . . . Henry! Henry! EPILOGUE. The silent Forces of the World, Time, Change, and Fate, deride us still; Nor ever from the hidden summit, furled, Where sits the Eternal Will, The clouds of Pain and Error rise Before our straining eyes. It is to-day as 'twas before, From the far days when Man began to speak, Ere Moses preached or Homer sung, Ere Buddha's musing thought or Plato's silvery tongue. We pace our destined path with failing footsteps weak; A little more we see, a little more Of that great orb which shineth day and night Through the high heaven, now hidden, now too bright, The Sun to which the earth on which we are, Life's labouring world, is as the feeblest star. Nor this firm globe we know Which lies beneath our feet; Nor by what grades we have grown and yet shall grow, Through chains of miracle, more and more complete; By what decrees the watery earth Compacted grew the womb of countless birth; Nor, when the failing breath Is taken by the frozen lips of Death, Whither the Spoiler, fleeing with his prey, The fluttering, wandering Wonder bears away. The powers of Pain and Wrong, Immeasurably strong, Assail our souls, and chill with common doubt Clear brain and heart devout: War, Pestilence, and Famine, as of old, The lust of the flesh, the baser lust of gold, Vex us and harm us still; Fire comes, and crash and wreck, and lives are shed As if the Eternal Will itself were dead; And sometimes Wrong and Right, the thing we fear, The thing we cherish, draw confusedly near; We know not which to choose, we cannot separate Our longing and our hate. But Love the Conqueror, Love, Immortal Love, Through the high heaven doth move, Spurning the brute earth with his purple wings, And from the great Sun brings Some radiant beam to light the House of Life, Uplifts our grosser thought, and makes us pure; And to a Higher Purpose doth mature Our trivial days, and calms the ignoble strife, Raises the waning life with his sweet breath, And from the arms of Death Soars with it to the eternal shore, Where sight or thought of evil comes no more. Love sitteth now above, Enthroned in glory, And yet hath deigned to move Through life's sad story. Fair Name, we are only thine! Thou only art divine! Be with us to the end, for there is none But thou to bind together God and Man in one! THE ODE OF LIFE THE ODE OF CREATION. A dark and boundless deep, And a blind height above, Untrodden fields of sleep, Wherein no force may move, Where every sound is still, Nor breathes a living breath;‚Äî These are the heights, these are the depths, these are the voids of Death. But slowly on the lifeless plain There wakes a far-sent ray, a little star, A tiny spark of Being from afar, A throb of precious pain. It is done, it has been, it has risen, the glimmer of Life, The dark void withdrawing around, It breaks with a whisper of sound, Through the wastes of silence and sleep, There is no more stillness nor Death, The great Universe wakes with a deep-drawn singultient breath. The great orbs cohere and spin on their measureless ways‚Äî ‚ÄîThe great suns awaken and shine, ringed with girdles of fire every one‚Äî All the worlds are on fire and ablaze‚Äî The flaming globes circle and whirl each one round its sun ‚ÄîThe hot seas seethe and bellow‚Äîthe fixed hills glow‚Äî And the blast of Creation burns fierce while the centuries grow; And Life and Time have begun! Myriads on myriads of years! Or was there indeed no time except in the Infinite Mind? And was there indeed no ceaseless circling of spheres? Since no sentient eye might mark the peripheries wind, And at length the great Life of the worlds grown concentrate would thrill Through some lowly speck of matter, which, waxing apart, Grew conscious by slow degrees, and blossomed in Will; Weak centres of Force, which floated as motes in a beam, Automatic, contracting, expanding, but consciousless yet. Till a stronger force working within them would raise them once more, Pushing with inchoate fin as if with an oar Afloat on the slow warm stream; And another Creation has come and a new-begun strife, With this primal glimmer of life. Myriads on myriads of years! If Time there were yet, When no soul was by to remember or to forget; The fin growing stronger, and changing to wing or to claw, Struggle on struggle, sentience, consciousness, ravin, and pain, Monstrous and mail√®d forms in the ooze, or hurtling thro' air, Waging through √¶ons of time the ineffable struggles which gain Order thro' waste and thro' wear. Till the mastodon stalks forth in might with hoof and with jaw, And the law of the Higher prevails, the Ultimate Law, And the cooler earth teems with life, on land and in sea: Life organic in beast, fish, or bird, in herb or in tree, Life dominant, life exulting with quick-coming breath, Life that fades down and sinks in the silence and slumber of Death. But no soul to mark the struggle nor thought which might turn To whence those weird fires burn. Successions, progressions, a scheme of insensible life, One Will alone directing the infinite strife, One Force, one Eye, one Sole and Regarding Mind, In a Universe deaf and blind! And was it some Inner Law, Some hidden potency of Force, Or some creative breath Divine, Which sped the creature on its upward course? Until at last it woke and saw, With visual forces fine, The Godhead that was round it every where, The spiritual essence fair, Which doth innerve this outward show of things‚Äî And filled the brute with high imaginings, And winging it with new-found wings Lifted its aspect to the infinite sky, Where, in the Light of the Creative Eye Its ancient slough away it cast, And rose to Man at last! How know we or can trace The first beginnings of all Time, Who know not yet indeed how this our race Rises to heights sublime? In darkness does our life begin, Hidden and fenced within. In darkness and obscurity Dwell the blind germs which yet shall be. In darkness the slow rolling months fulfil The pre-ordain√®d will. And even in childhood's earliest days, No memory-haunted ways Take our first footsteps; but in deep And unremembered tracts of sleep The immature creature dwells, nor can recall Its former self or primal state at all. THE ODE OF INFANCY. Oh, little child! Stretched on thy mother's knees, with steadfast gaze And innocent aspect mild, Viewing this novel scene in mute amaze, Following the moving light, thy mother's smile, And storing up the while New precious knowledge till thou com'st to be Sage it may be or clown‚Äî Soaring or sinking down, To topmost heights of weal or depths of misery; How shall I dare to mark thy innocent look, And write as in a book Thy infinite possibilities of life; What fate awaits thee in the coming strife, What joys, what triumphs in the growing years, What depths of woe and tears? I see thee lie Safe in thy silken cradle, sunk in down, Within thy father's palace-chambers fair; Thy guarded slumbers breathing tempered air; The soft eyes, full of yearning, watching by; Caressing arms waiting thy waking cry; All luxury and state which can assuage Life's painful heritage; The prayers of a people swell for thee Up to the careless skies which cover all. And yet it may be thine to fall Far from thy loved and native land, And end thy imperfect, innocent life-tale here, Forsaken on a savage desert strand, Pierced through and through by some barbarian spear. I see thy tiny face Pale, worn with hunger, and large hollow eyes, Upon the frozen way-side laid Stiffening in thy dead mother's cold embrace. I hear thy piteous cries When the sot flings thee down with limbs that bleed‚Äî Flings thee, and takes no heed; Weak, helpless, born to misery, girt round With vice and sin and shame, in sight and sound. Poor life foredoomed, already sunk and lost; Too often sent to tread the ways of death With childish failing breath; Yet ofttimes holding power To bloom a virgin flower Upon the untrodden heights closed to the multitude, Among the wise and good. Or with brown face thou comest and limb, Naked, on the warm soil that bears the palm; Or haply the young heir of all the dim And half-forgotten realms whose ruins stand Sown lion-haunted on the deathlike calm Which wraps the Egyptian or Assyrian sand, Reared 'midst the dust of empires; or art now As through all history thou wert, the child Of savage parents, rude and wild, Springing and falling; born to flower and seed, Or sink upon the uncaring earth, a weed Trodden by the pitiless feet of cruel men With hearts that ape the tiger's; or art born In the old, old empire, which hath long outworn God and the hopes of man, and yet coheres, Propped by its own far-reaching bulk, as when It did emerge from savagery and grew, Oh, child! as yet may you, To worldly strength, and knowledge, and dead lore Of wisdom fled before, And dull content, and soulless hopes and fears. Wherever thou mayest be, To me thou art wonderful and strange to see‚Äî Busied with trifles, rapt with simple toys, As men with graver joys. I hear thy lisping accents slowly reach The miracle of speech; I mark thy innocent smile; I treasure up each baby wile Which smooths the brow of thought, the front of care. Thou royal scion, born to be the heir Of all the unrecorded days, since first Man rose to his full being, once blest, and then accurst In weal and woe and ill Thou art a miracle still. From snow-bound hut to equatorial strand, Above thee still regarding angels stand; While thy brief life-tale fleeteth like a dream Across Creation's glass. Dark powers of ill press thee on either side, As now thy swift years pass, Revealing on the young soul's tablets white The eternal characters of Right; Or sometimes with the growing years grown strong The unhallowed signs of wrong. Oh, little child! thou bringest with thee still, As Moses, parting from the fiery hill, Some dim reflection in thine eyes, Some sense of Godhead, some indefinite wonder As of one drifted here unwillingly; Who knows no speech of ours, and yet doth keep Some dumb remembrance of a gracious home Which lights his waking hours and fills his sleep With precious visions which unbidden come; Some golden link which nought of earth can sunder, Some glimpse of a more glorious land and sea! Oh, precious vision fleeting past! Oh, age too fair to last! For soon new gifts and powers are thine, And growing springs and summers bring Boyhood or girlhood hastening, And nerve the agile limb, and teach, With the new gift of speech, The wonders that stand round on every side, And Life's imperial portals opening gradually wide. THE ODE OF CHILDHOOD. I. Boyhood. Fair budding age, Which next upon life's stage Passest a fairy dream before the eyes, High health and bounding limb, Eager and stretching towards the wished-for prize; Whate'er the passing care that takes thy thought, I catch the sweet brisk scent of trodden grass When through the golden afternoon Of a long day in June, Until the twilight dim, The playfield echoes with the joyous noise Of troops of agile boys, Who, bare-armed, throw the rapid-bounding ball; Who shout and race and fall. I see the warm pool fringed with meadow-sweet, Where stream in summer, with eager feet Through gold of buttercups and crested grass The gay processions stripping as they pass. I hear the cool and glassy depths divide As the bold fair young bodies, far more fair Than ever sculptured Nereids were, Plunge fearless down, or push, with front or side, Through the caressing wave. I mark the deadly chill, thro' the young blood, When some young life, snatched from the cruel flood, Looks once upon the flowers, the fields, the sun,‚Äî Looks once, and then is done! Or the grey, frosty field, and the great ball Urged on by flying feet. Or when the skate rings on the frozen lake, The gliding phantoms fleet, Rosy with health, and laughing though they fall. Or by the rapid stream or swirling pool, The fisher, with his pliant wand. Or by the covert-side, taking his stand, The shooter, watching patient hour by hour, With that hard youthful heart that young breasts hold, Till the fur glances through the brake; As when our savage sires wandered of old, Hungering through primal wastes. I see them all, The brisk, swift days of youth, which cares for nought But for the joy of living; scarce a thought Of Love, or Knowledge, or at best Such labour as gives zest To the great joy of living. Oh, blest time! For which each passing hour rings out a chime Of joy-bells all the year; ay, tho' through days Of ill thou farest, and unhappy ways; Or whether on the sun-struck lands thy feet Are the young savage hunter's, lithe and fleet, Turning at night-fall to thy father's cot, Bathed in the full white moonlight; or dost stand 'Mid the hushed plains of some forsaken land;‚Äî Where'er thou art, oh, boyhood! thou art free And fresh as the young breeze in summer born On sun-kissed hills or on the laughing sea, Or gay bird-music breathing of the morn, Or some sweet rose-bud pearled with early dew, As brief and fair as you. II. Girlhood. Or in another channel still more sweet, Life's current flows along, Ere yet the tide of passion, full and strong, Hurries the maiden's feet. Oh, sweet and early girlish years Of innocent hopes and fears! Busied with fancies bright and gay, Which Love shall chase away, When, with the flutter of celestial wings, He stirs the soul forth from its depths, and brings Healing from trouble. Oh, deep well Of fairy fancies undefiled! Oh, sweet and innocent child! Now with thy doll I see thee full of care, Or filled already with the mother's air, Hushing thy child to sleep. And now thyself immersed in slumbers, deep Yet light, I see thee lie. And now the singer, lifting a clear voice In soaring hymns or carols that rejoice, Or busied with thy seam, or doubly fair For the unconscious rapture of thy look Lost in some simple book. Whate'er the colour of thy face, Thou art fulfilled with grace. Oh, little maiden, fair or brown! Thine is the simple beauty which doth crown The dreams of happy fathers, who have past By Love and Passion, and have come To know pure joys of home; And for the hurry and haste of younger years, Have taken the hearth that cheers, And the fair realm of duty, and delight Of innocent faces bright And the sweet wells of deep untroubled love A daughter's name can move. In every clime and age I see thee still, Since the rude nomads wandered forth at will Upon the unbounded Aryan pastures wild‚Äî There thou wert, oh, fair child! ‚ÄúThe milker‚Äù 'twas they called thee; all day long Tending the browsing herds with high-voiced song; Or on some sun-warmed place Upon the flower-faced grass, Watching the old clouds pass, And weaving wreaths with such wild grace And sprightly girlish glee As Proserpine did once in sunny Sicily. Or maybe by some widowed hearth‚Äî The fairest, saddest sight on earth, Filled too soon with sweet care, And bringing back the voice and air Of thy dead mother; thou art set An innocent virgin-mother, childlike yet. Thy baby sisters on thy loving arm Sleep fast, secure from harm. Thou hast no time for game or toy, Or other thought but this; Finding thy full reward, thy chiefest joy, In thy fond father's kiss. Or under palms to-day, Thy childhood fleets away; Or by the broadening shadow hid, Of tomb or pyramid; In stainless whiteness: or maybe Forlorn in haunts of misery; Thou keepest on thy rounded face Some unforgotten trace Of the old primal days unsung, Of the fresh breezes of pure morn When the first maiden child was born, And Time was young. Fair streams which run as yet Each in its separate channel from the snows; Boyhood and girlhood; while Life's banks are set With blooms that kiss the clear lymph as it flows, One swift and strong and deep, One where the lilies sleep;‚Äî Fair streams, which soon some stress of Life and Time Shall bring together, Under new magical skies and the strange weather Of an enchanted clime. THE ODE OF YOUTH. Now upon the tree of life there rise Before our wondering eyes Two strange new flowers of varied hue. The tree is grown, The flowers are blown, There is nought wanting to its early sweetness; But with a fair completeness, The purple bloom and white Fill the entranced, admiring sight. The tree is grown, the tree is strong; Oh! dear to art and song! Fair time of Flowers! within whose chalice sweet Lurks Youth with rosy feet, And Love with purple folded wing, And birdlike thoughts that sing. I.‚ÄîEarly Manhood. And first, oh youth, I see thee with the plume Of thy thick locks upon thy forehead set, And thy frank eyes kindling with fire, or dim With soaring thoughts of heaven, or wet With kindly dews of pity; the straight limb And the strong arm, and force that never tires; The cheek and lip touched with the early down Of manhood's fullest crown; The heart, which hardly thought of passion fires; The mind, which opens like a flower in spring To all the wanton airs the seasons bring;‚Äî The young existence self-contained no longer, But pressing outward hour by hour, Fired with a thirst continually stronger, For some supreme white flower. Whatever be the prize‚Äî Whether upon the difficult heights of Thought, Or 'midst the white laborious dust of Duty, Or on the peaks of Power, the bloom be sought, Or in the flush and thrill of the new Beauty Born of a maiden's eyes. Oh, happiest age of all When hope is without measure And life a thrill of pleasure, And health is high and force unspent, Nor Disappointment yet, nor sordid Care, Nor yet Satiety, nor the cold chill Which creeps upon the world-worn heart to kill All higher hope, and leaves us to despair; Nor doubt of God or men can touch, but all The garden ground of Life is opened wide; And lo! on every side The flowers of spring are blooming, and the air Is scented, and sweet song is everywhere, And young eyes read from an enchanted book, With rapt entranc√®d look, Loves legend and the Dream of days to be, And fables fair of Life's mythology, Through the still hours till dewy twilight fall. Whatever be the page‚Äî Whether of metaphysical riddles faint, Or the rapt visions of some ancient seer, The burning thoughts of saint, Or maxims of the sage‚Äî Thou comest, oh youth, with thought as sure, With mind severe and pure; Thou takest afresh, with each returning year, The fair thin dreams, the philosophic lore Of the great names of yore‚Äî Plato the wise, Confucius, Socrates, The blessed Gautama‚Äîall are thine; Upon thee year by year the words divine Of our great Master, falling like the dew, Sway thee, to hate the wrong, to love the true; For thee the fair poetic page is spread Of the great living and the greater dead; For thee the glorious gains of Science lie Stretched open to thine eye; And to thy fresh and undimmed brain, The mysteries of Number and of Space Seem easy to explain; Thou lookest with clear gaze upon the long Confusions of the Race, the paradox of Wrong; And dost not fear to trace, With youth's strong fiery faith that knows no chill, The secret of Transgression, the prime source Of Good and Evil, and the unfailing course Of the Ineffable Will. And sometimes life, glowing with too fierce fire, O'er sea and land in rapid chase, Snatches thee with tumultuous will, And careless, breathless pace. Sometimes a darker thought Comes on thee as a shadow of night, Marring thy young life's white, And some new longing in the past untaught, And at thy side shamefast Desire Stands unreproved and guides thy bashful feet To where, girt by dim depths of solitude, Sits Fancy, disarrayed, in a deep wood; And ah, but Youth runs swift and Pleasure is sweet! And sometimes, too, looking with too bold eye Upon the unclouded sky, Sudden the heavens are hidden, and the great Sun Sinks as if day were done, And the brain reels and all the life grows faint, Smitten by too much light; or a thick haze Born out of sense doth overcloud The soul, and leaves it blind and in amaze, And the young heart is dull and the young brain Dark till God shine again. Oh, fairest age of all! Whate'er thy race or clime, To-day ten thousand cities on thee call, Broad plain and palm-fringed isle. Thine is the swelling life, the eager glance and smile, Oh, precious fruit of Life and Time! Oh, worker of the world! to whose young arm The brute earth yields and wrong, as to a charm; Young seaman, soldier, student, toiler at the plough, Or loom, or forge, or mine, a kingly growth art thou! Where'er thou art, though earthy oft and coarse, Thou bearest with thee hidden springs of force, Creative power, the flower, the fruitful strife, The germ, the potency of Life, Which draws all things to thee unwittingly. The Future lies within thy loins, and all the Days to be To thee Time giveth to beget, The Thought that shall redeem and lift Man higher yet. II.Maidenhood. But lo! another form appears Upon Life's glass. Oh, pure and white! Oh, delicate and bright! Oh, primal growth of Time! Sweet maidenhood! that to a silvery chime Of music, and chaste fancies undefiled, And modest grace and mild, Com√´st, best gift of God to men, As fair to-day as when The first man, waking from his deep And fancy-haunted sleep, Found his strength spent, and at his side His fair dream glorified; High-soaring note, leading harmonious song Through secular discords long. Oh, lily of Life's garden! fair of hue And sweet of scent, watered with heaven's own dew; Fair being, holding hidden motherhood And undeveloped good; Implicit in thee, even as white blooms hold Their fragrant globes of gold, Men know no praise they can withhold from thee, Oh, sweet virginity! Since Artemis first trod the youngling earth. Thou glorious and surpassing birth! The Vestal fires were thine, the convents cold Are thine as those of old. To thee, when strong sweet flowers of Life and Sense, Scent gross, we turn, oh white and gracious innocence! Yea, still, while life flows fast and free, To thee we turn a world-worn eye. Throbbing delights are youth's and pulses high; Yet these at last will ebb, and then to thee We turn, oh fair pale lily, clothed with purity! For sure it is indeed Two streams through Life's ground flow, and both are good‚Äî The one whose goal is gracious motherhood; The other in the cloister pale and dim Finding sufficient meed In pure observance, rite, and soaring hymn. We may not blame nor hold them wrong Who through their lives their liturgies prolong, Even though the prize of motherhood be great. But always thine, oh, blest estate! Thine it is, under youth's hot sun, to keep Celestial snows and pure abysses deep. I see thy fair expanding mind, A precious blossom parcel-blown, Not with the young man's noble rage, But with a gentler radiance all thy own, Fixed now on history's fabled page, Now on the bard's diviner thought, And now by some deep music stirred, Deeper than any spoken word, Or sweet love-story soft as southern wind. Dear flower and fair to mortal eye, Whatever be thy age, thy clime, thy race, Whether the gentle curve of thy young breast Be hidden in white lawn or stand confest In innocent brown nakedness and grace, Thou art the high and unattain√®d prize Of all the generations that have been; Upon Life's throne thou sittest as a Queen, And at thy gracious feet The ages kneel to thy eternal Truth. Thy pure and spotless innocence, And free from stain of Time and Sense, Thy undefil√®d youth. White flower of Life's tree, Love like a wanton bee, Shall fly to thee, and from thy deep cold cells Rifle the honey. Tranquil stream, That from the chill heart of the untrodden snow, So calm and clear dost flow; Spring wakes beneath the gleam Of a new sun which swells A warm and rapid torrent strong, Soon in the sunny balmy weather, To break its banks and bear together Your mingled streams along. THE ODE OF LOVE. I am afraid To sing thee, oh Immortal Love, who know By what majestic voices long ago Thy eulogy was said. I do not dare To bring a voice which thou didst never train, To the high-soaring difficult air Of thy celestial strain. Yet how of Life to sing, and yet not tell of Love; And since thou art the source of song, And all our hearts dost move, I will essay thy praise nor fear to do thee wrong. For see, the lovers go With lingering steps and slow, By dim arcades where sunbeams scarcely reach; On sea-struck northern beach; Or breathless tropic strand, By evening breezes fanned; Or through the thick life-laden air Of some great city; or through the hush Of summer twilights 'midst the corn; When all the dying heavens glow and blush Or the young moonlight curves its crescent horn. Oh, wondrous bond that binds In one sweet concord separate minds, And from their union gives To the rapt gazer's eye A finer essence and more high, A young and wing√®d God, who lives In purer air and seeks a loftier sky! If growing cares and lower aims should banish All thought of heavenly hopes and higher things, While we can mount upon thy soaring wings They shall not wholly vanish. Thou art the immortal part of man, the soul, Which, scorning earth's control, Lifts us from selfish thought and grovelling gains. Thou always, whilst thy power remains, Canst pierce the dull dead weight of cloud, By which our thought is bowed, And raise our clear and cleans√®d eyes To the eternal skies. No sting of sense it is That gives thee wings and lifts thee up to heaven. Too high art thou for this; Ethereal, pure, free from earth's grosser leaven. If ought of sense be thine, 'tis but the air, Whose weight can lift thee up to soar, Which can thy heavenward pinions bear From brute earth more and more Up to the fount of Power and Love Whence all things move. And see, the lovers go With lingering steps and slow, Over all the world together, all in all, Over all the world! Great empires fall; The onward march of Man seems spent; The nations rot in dull content; The blight of war, a bitter flood, From continent to continent, Surges in waves of blood; The light of knowledge sinks, the fire of thought burns low; There seems scant thought of God; but yet One power there is men ne'er forget, And still through every land beneath the skies, Rapt, careless, looking in each other's eyes, With lingering steps and slow, The lovers go. A pillar of light Goes evermore before their dazzled eyes Purple and golden-bright, Youth's vast horizons spread and the unbounded skies. Oh bless√®d dream which for awhile dost hide The sorrows of the world and leave life glorified. Oh blessed light that risest still, Young eyes and souls to fill! Linked arms and hearts aglow; Wherever man is more than brute, To this self-sacrifice our natures grow. Rapt each in each they go, and mute, Listening to the sweet song Which Love, with mystic accents, all day long Sings to them, like a hidden bird, Sweeter than e'er was seen or heard, Which from life's thick-leaved tree Sings sadly, merrily, A strange, mixed song, a changeful strain, Which rises now to joy and jollity, Now seemeth to complain; But with a sweeter music far than is Of earthborn melodies. He sees within her eyes That which his nature needs to be complete‚Äî The grace, the pureness, the diviner sweet, Which to rude souls and strong our Life denies; The vision of his nightly dream; More pure than e'er did seem The Nymphs of old, by wood, or hill, or stream. She views in him the strong Deep note which adds the fulness to life's song; High aims and thoughts that glow She does not dream, she cannot know What turbid forces rude and wild Sully his youth's tumultuous flow; She, full of virgin fancies, pale and mild. They draw to each other, they flow to the deep as one, Together thro' all lands beneath the sun, In twin attempered streams, set side by side, So near that scarce a footpace may divide Their separate depths, and this maybe is best; Or maybe in each other lost, In calm or tempest-tost, One broad full river they roll on to the sea, One full accordant harmony, High song and deep, one perfect note; Or maybe troublous as the wintry wave, Or some hoarse accent of a tuneless throat, They know no longer peace or rest, Ill-mated, hapless, self-opprest, Till silent in the grave. Yet draw together, draw together still, Fair souls and free, fair souls and young! Still shall thy praise, Immortal Love, be sung! Thou art the Spirit which doth animate; The Universal Will, Which speeds the Race upon the ways of Fate; Which speeds it onwards, gaining strength Little by little, line on line, Till, as our hope is, risen at length To plenitude Divine, It comes to what high issue rare The Future shall prepare. THE ODE OF PERFECT YEARS. Now flower and perfect fruit Together dress the tree, High midsummer has come, midsummer mute Of song, but rich to scent and sight. The sun is high in heaven, the skies are bright And full of blessedness, High hope and wild endeavour Have fled or sunk for ever; Only the swifter seasons onward press, And every day that goes Is a full-scented, full-blown garden rose, Orb√®d, complete. And every hour brings its own burden sweet Of daily duty, precious care; Wherefrom the visible landscape calm and clear Shows finer far, and the high heaven more near, Than ever morning skies of sunrise were. I miss the unbounded hope of old, The freshness and the glow of youth; I miss the fever and the fret, The luminous haze of gold. I see a mind clearer and calmer yet, A more unselfish love, a more unclouded truth; Such gain I take, and this More gracious shows and fair than that I miss. Fatherhood. Oh, father! sitting at thy hearth, With sunny heads around and lisping talk, For whom the world without and all the earth Is nought to this; and to the strong deep love Which, mixed with pity, all thy soul doth move. Strong worker, watching o'er the tottering walk And feeble limbs and growing thought and brain, Rejoicing in each new-found gain As the first sire, alone in Paradise; And patient and content to work all day, If with the eve returning from thy toil Thou canst put off the sad world's stain and soil, And bending downward to thy children's eyes, Rise cleansed and pure as they. I know not if life holds a more divine Or fairer lot than thine. Strong, patient worker, king of those who can To its high goal of Things to be, Its goal of Fate and Mystery, Lead forth the race of Man! Thy way is ofttimes hard, And toilsome oft thy feet; Thine are the days of anxious care, When the spent brain reels, or the strong arm tires; Yet all the ease and charm of days that were, And Pleasure paling all her fading fires, Allure no more, but the tired hunter now, Or now the worker with the furrowed brow On frozen wastes or sun-struck thou dost show; By mart, or loom, or mine, or bending down Chained to thy desk within the stifling town, Thou toilest daily that thy brood may live. Cares are thine, cares, and the unselfish mind Which spends itself for others and can find How blest it is without return to give. Whate'er thy race or speech, thou art the same; Before thy eyes Duty, a constant flame, Shines always steadfast with unchanging light, Through dark days and through bright. Sometimes, by too great misery bowed down, Or poison-draughts brought lower than the beast, Thou comest to hate the hollow eyes around, Dreading thy cares increased, And dost despise thy own, And canst thy dead heart steel against their cries, And mark unmoved the hunger in their eyes; Or sometimes, filled with love, art powerless to aid. Oh, misery, to make our souls afraid! Or if a happier lot Await thee, yet by precious wells of tears Thy life's road goes, vain hopes and anxious fears, Thine 'tis, perchance, to mark the grassy mound Which keeps, within the churchyard's narrow ground, Thy darling who is not. Hopes sunk in tears, tears that ascend to hope; Such is thy horoscope, Oh father, standing by the little grave, And impotent to save! Thy heart is moved with pity For thy young growing lives, who needs must come To leave the safe and sacred walls of home; For whose young souls, Life, like a cruel city, Spreads out her nets of sin. Thou knowest well of old The strong allurements which they scarce may shun, The subtle wiles, the innocent lives undone, The tide of passion, scorning all control, And thou art filled with an immense despair, Wherefrom thy heart beats slow, thy eyes grow dim, As when of yore thou heardst them lisp a hymn With early childish lips: thou canst not bear To think of that young whiteness soiled and foul, Or that thick darkness blotting the young soul. Yet from thy grief and pain Comes ofttimes greater gain Than all thy loss. Thou knowest what it is to grieve, And from the burden of thy cross Thou comest to believe. Thou who hast lost and yet dost love, Thou, too, a Father hast in some dim sphere above, Who doth regard thy joys, thy miseries, Thy petty doubts of Him, thy feeble learning, Thy faults, thy pains, thy childish doubt and yearning, Even as thou dost these. Motherhood. But here is one who over all the earth Is worshipped and is blest, Who doth rejoice from holier springs of mirth, And sorrow from a deeper fount of tears, On whose sweet bosom is our earliest rest, Whose tender voice that cheers Is our first memory, which still doth last Thro' all our later past‚Äî The love of love or child, the world-worn strife, The turmoil and the triumphs of a life‚Äî The sweet maid-mother, pure and mild, The deep love undefiled. Thou art the universal praise Of every human heart, the secret shrine Where seer and savage keep a dream divine Through growing and declining days; And but for thee And thy unselfish love, thy sacrifice, Which brings heaven daily nearer to our eyes, Men whom the rude world stains, men chilled by doubt, Would find no ray of Deity To fire a Faith gone out. Our life from a twofold root Springs upwards to the sky, One, surface only, shared with tree and brute, And one, as deep and strong as heaven is high. Spirit and sense, Each bears its part and dwells in innocence Yet only grown together can they bear The one consummate fruit. The flower is good, the flower is fair, But holds no lasting sweetness in its petals thin, No seed of life within. But the ripe fruit within its orb√®d gold Doth hidden secrets hold; Within its honied wells set safe and deep, The Future lies asleep. Of shamefastness our being is born, Of shamefastness and scorn. Oh, wonder, that so high dost soar! Oh, vision, blest for evermore! With every throe of birth Two glorious Presences make glad the earth The stainless mother and the Eternal Child. Of the heart comes love, of the heart and not the brain; To heights where Thought comes not can Love attain: We cannot tell at all, we may not know, How to such stature high our lower natures grow; What strong instinctive thrill The mother's being doth fill, And raises it from miry common ways, Up to such heights of love. We cannot tell what bless√®d forces move, And so transform the careless girlish heart To bear so high a part. We cannot tell; we can but praise. Fair motherhood, by every childish tongue Thy eulogy is sung. In every passing age The theme of seer and sage: The painters saw thee in a life-long dream; The painters who have left a world more fair Than ever days of nymph and goddess were‚Äî Blest company, who now for centuries Have fixed the virgin mother for our eyes‚Äî The painters saw thee sitting brown or fair, Under the Tuscan vines or colder Northern air; They saw pure love transform thy peasant gaze; They saw thy reverent eyes, thy young amaze And left thee Queen of Heaven, wearing a crown Of glory; and abased at thy sweet breast, Spurning his robes of kingship down, The God-child laid at rest. They found thee, and they fixed thee for our eyes; But every day that goes Before the gazer new Madonnas rise. What matter if the cheek show not the rose, Nor look divine is there nor queenly grace? The mother's glory lights the homely face. In every land beneath the circling sun Thy praise is never done. Whatever men may doubt, they put their trust in thee; Rude souls and coarse, to whom virginity Seems a dead thing and cold. So always was it from the days of old; So shall it be while yet our race doth last; Though truth be sought no more and faith be past, Still, till all hope of heaven be dead, Thy praises shall be said. Aye, thou art ours, or wert, ere yet The loss we ne'er forget, The loss which comes to all who reach life's middle way. We see thee by the childish bed Sit patient all night long, To cool the parching lips or throbbing head; We hear thee still with simple song Or sweet hymn lull the wakeful eyes to sleep; Through every turning of life's chequered page, Joying with those who joy, weeping with those who weep. Oh, sainted love! oh, precious sacrifice! Oh, heaven-lighted eyes! Best dream of early youth, best memory of age! Labour. They do the Maker wrong Who with the closing days of youth Shut fast the gate of Song; Nor ever shall I hold it truth, With those who feign to tell the tale of life, That only love is worth, the love that binds A youth and maid, nor care at all For the long summer ere the fruit shall fall, And deem unfit for song the glorious strife, The joy of toil and thought, the clash of vigorous minds, When knowledge flies before and we pursue, And who the Fair once followed, follow now the True. Ah, full fair life! if something we have lost, If never more again We feel the ancient joy, the former pain, If no more passion-tost Upon the tides of life we hurry by, The white waves laughing as we plunge along, Nor watch the light clouds drift along the sky, While the glad South snatches us swift and strong To some blest isle beyond the purple wave, Where Love is Queen and Mirth, nor Prudence grave Nor Wisdom frowns, but to be glad is all, From jocund morn till dewy evening fall; Oh, if that sky is dark‚Äîthose winds are still‚Äî Another day has risen: again from the East Our treasure is increased; And as the orient Lord begins to grow, New airs begin to blow; And on the calm majestic tide, Our full-sailed galleon comes to glide, Love, with its little skiff, has gone, But Life's great bark sails on. Toil is the law of life, and its best fruit: This from the uncaring brute Divides;‚Äîthis and the prescient mind whose store Grows daily more and more. Toil is the mother of wealth, The nurse of health; Toil 'tis that gives the zest To well-earned rest; The law of life laid broad and deep As are the fixed foundations of the sea, The medicine of grief, the remedy, Wherefrom Life giveth his beloved sleep. Oh, labour truly blest! Thou rulest all the race; Over all the toiling earth I see thy gracious face Stand forth confest. Wherever thou art least, In those fair lands beneath the tropic blaze, The slothful savage, likened to the beast, Drags on his soulless length of days; Where most thou art, Man rises upward to a loftier height, And views the earth and heaven with clearer sight, And holds a cleaner heart. I see the toilers with the awaking morn, Ere yet the day is born, Go forth to labour over all the earth. In northern darkness, 'midst the wintry rain, The great bell clangs thro' the smoke laden air; And ere light comes the workers gather there, While the great engines throb, the swift wheels turn, And the long, sickly gaslights flare and burn; I hear the slow winch creak above the pit, While the black workers, who have toiled all night, Rise, dazed, to rest and light; I see the fisher on the waking sea; The great ship, full-manned, heaving silently Across the foam; reapers in yellow corn; The frosty shepherd in the early morn; The naked worker bent among the cane Or cotton; the vinedresser, lean and brown; The thousand labours of the busy town; The myriad trades which in each clime and race Build up man's dwelling-place; I see the countless toiling multitude; And all I see is good. But to ends nobler still The nobler workers of the world are bent. It is not best in an inglorious ease To sink and dull content, When wild revolts and hopeless miseries The unquiet nations fill; It is not best to rot In dull observance, while the bitter cry Of weak and friendless sufferers rends the sky, Wailing their hopeless lot; Or rest in coward fear on former gain, Making old joys supply the present pain. Nay, best it is indeed To spend ourselves upon the general good; And, oft misunderstood, To strive to lift the knees and limbs that bleed;‚Äî This is the best, the fullest meed. Let ignorance assail or hatred sneer Who loves his race he shall not fear; He suffers not for long, Who doth his soul possess in loving, and grows strong. Oh, student! far into the night From youth to age Bent low upon the blinding page, Content to catch some gleam of light; Art thou not happy, though the world pass by?‚Äî Happy though Honours seek thee not, nor Fame, And no man knows thy name?‚Äî Happy in that blest company of old Whose names are writ in characters of gold Upon the rocks of Time, the glorious band Who on the shining mountains stand, Thinker and jurist, bard or seer, Whatever name is brightest and most dear? Or thou with docile hand, Obedient to the visionary eye, Who 'midst art's precious work dost choose to stand Amid the great ones of the days gone by. Oh, blest and glorious lot, always to be With dreams of beauty compassed round about! The godlike mother and the child divine, Or land or sea or sky, in calm or storm, Nature's sincerest verities of form‚Äî To see from canvas or from marble shine, Little by little orbing gradually, Some trace of hidden Godhead gleaming out! Or who, from heart and brain inspired, create, Defying time, defying fate, Some deathless theme and high, Some verse which cannot die, Some lesson which shall still be said Altho' their tongue be lost and dead; Or who, in daily labour's trivial round, Their fitting work have found; Or who on high, guiding the car of State, Are set, a people's envy and their pride, Who, spurning rank and ease and wealth, And setting pleasure aside and health, And meeting contumely oft and hate, Have lived laborious lives and all too early died. Or shall I silence keep Of you, oh ministering women fair, Who, while the world lies sunk in careless sleep, Still for the love of God and man can bear To watch by alien sick-beds, and to guard With little hope and scant reward, Midst misery and foul infected air, The friendless and the dying? Shall I dare To sing of labour's meed, nor hold you dear? Dear souls, your joys are great, and yet not wholly here; In heaven they blossom best and grow complete, And beautiful upon the eternal mountains are your feet. Ay, labour, thou art blest. From all the earth, thy voice, a constant prayer, Soars upward day and night. A voice of aspiration after right; A voice of effort yearning for its rest; A voice of high hope conquering despair! Rest. There is a joy in rest; There is a joy to cease and to be still. This is the remedy of all the best, To cure the pain of too laborious will. Ah! it is sweet to lie reclined, Reaping the fallow mind, When all the sweat and drouth of day is done, And a cool breeze breathes from the setting sun. The toiler sits before his cottage door, Set with musk-roses round, and eglantine, In dewy, scented, twilight-glooms divine, When all the trouble of the week is o'er, And sabbath rest comes with the evening sun: The joyous shouts come up from pool or green; Round the white chestnut-spikes the beetles hum; And down the hawthorn-haunted by-ways come The loitering lovers, hardly seen Till springs aloft the clear, large moon Of pleasant June. Or by the palm-thatched hut at shut of eve, The dusky toilers lie, when the red sun Is sinking or has gone. A cool wind rises landward from the sea; The fire-flies glance like silver in the palm; On the fringed shore the thundering rollers heave; And all the simple souls are full of glee, And the fair earth of calm. Or on the hot and trackless sand, In the sweet dying day, Beyond the unknown monuments of the dead, The last muezzin calls, the prayers are said, And turbaned faces stern relax a while To some unwonted smile, Watching the large-eyed children at their play. Or maybe busy brains, which day by day Life's struggle frets away, Weary with fierce pursuit of fame or wealth, And prizing only health; Over the joyous wave in some swift boat, White-winged, delight to float From land to land upon the tideless sea; Borne careless still and free By hoary cape and gleaming southern town, And many an islet clothed with palm and vine, And on the wine-dark sea-depths looking down, High based on wave-worn fronts, the marble shrine; Or see the white town flush with dying day, And the red mountain fire the glimmering bay. Or maybe on the icy hill they creep Above the pines, across the frozen sea, Whose blue abysses bare the unfathomed deep; Each to the other bound, and silently, Fearful lest some chance step or spoken word, The avalanche trembling downward may have stirred; And up the giddy height Little by little, gaining slow, They gradually go, Till with hard toil of knee and hand, On the white summit panting but content, With full hearts throbbing high and forces spent, At last the climbers stand; For this of old is sure, That change of toil is toil's sufficient cure. Or by the lovely classic shore, The traveller sees with wondering eyes The treasure-house of art; the store Of gracious memories Left by some cunning vanished hand, At whose supreme command The spirit of beauty rose and did appear: The angel with the lily; the poor maid, Submissive, yet afraid; The fair Madonnas mild; The deep ineffable Child; The sweet boy-angels singing high and clear; The lady with the mystic smile; The kneeling Magi from the fabled East; The blessed Presence at the sacred feast; And many a virgin martyr sweet, And many a youthful saint, Gazing from heavenly eyes and free of guile; Who, when the tortured life began to faint, Looking in agony above, Saw the heavens opened, and the Paraclete Descending like a dove. Or maybe under secular trees Old when his ancestors were young, The statesman, in the golden autumn, sees New glories for the eloquent tongue, New triumphs gained against the banded might Of selfishness and fear, new struggles for the right; And in the falling evening and the sad Short light of waning days, Illumes his soul with subtle inward rays, And grows sedately glad. These thy refreshments are, oh blest And necessary Rest! Peaceful delights, which bear not soil and fret As do the victories of toil, and yet Bear their own fruit exceeding fair: Renewal of the labouring mind, New hopes, new dawns, and carking care A black night left behind. THE ODE OF GOOD. Eternal Spring, and Source Of happiness and weal! Indwelling and unfailing Force! Who dost Thyself reveal In every jocund day, and restful night; In every dawn serenely bright; In every tide of yearning which doth roll, Heavenward, some growing soul! What were life save for Thee But pain and misery‚Äî To have no more longing, but to be Below the brute, below the tree, Below the little stone, or speck of dust, Which are themselves, and are made just, Conforming to the law which bade them grow, Not dreaming dreams of heaven in their estate so low! The calm brutes live and are, Tranquil and unafraid, Keeping their nature only; the faint star Pursues its orbit always though of Thee It knows not, yet its vast periphery Is ordered by Thy hand; by Thee were laid The fixed foundations of the unfathomed sea;‚Äî All these obey Thee, though they may not know What law it is that holds them. Man alone Sees Thee, and knowing Thee, averts his face, And yet is higher than all for his disgrace, Which were impossible to brute, or tree, or stone How shall a finite voice Praise Thee who art too high for any praise, Great Scheme, that by eternal, perfect ways Farest and dost rejoice Thou wert before Life was, or Ill. Thou rulest all things still; The Governance and Regimen are Thine, Oh Plenitude divine! Of all the countless orbs that roll Through all Thy infinite space. We are through Thee alone, each in its place, Organic, Inorganic, great and small; Thou dost inspire and keep us all;‚Äî Earth, sky, and sea; herb, tree, insect, and brute; All Thy created excellences mute, To Man of large discourse, and the undying soul. We know not by what Name our tongues shall call Thee or Thy Essence, nor can Thought as yet Gain those ineffable heights where Thou art set, As from a watch-tower guarding all. Thou girdest Thyself round with mystery, As Thy great sun behind an embattled cloud, Or some wrapt summit, never seen; Yet Thy veiled presence cheers us on our road. With eyes bent down too much on earth and bowed, We toil and do forget All but our daily labour and its load; Yet art Thou there the while, felt yet unseen, Oh universal Good, and Thy great Will Directs our footsteps still‚Äî Directs them, though they come to stray From Thy appointed perfect way; Lights them, though for a while they wander far, Led by some feeble baleful star, Which can allure them when the blinding fold Of mist is on the hill side, and the cold Clouds which make green our lives, descending, hide Death's steeps on every side. We know not what Thou art‚Äî Whether the Word of some all-perfect Will Inborn and nourished in each human heart, Some hidden and mysterious good, Obeyed, not understood; Or whether the harmonious note Of some world-symphony divine, To which the perfect Scheme of things, Ever advancing perfectly To high fulfilment, sings. We know not what Thou art, and yet we love; We know not where Thou dwell'st, yet still above We turn our eyes to Thee, knowing Thou wilt take Our yearnings and wilt treasure them, and make Our little lives fulfil themselves and Thee: And in this trust we bear to be. Oh Light so white and pure, Oft clouded and yet sure! Oh inner Radiance of the heart, That drawest all men, whatsoe'er Thou art! Spring of the soul, that dost remove Winter with rays of love, And dost dispel of Thy far-working might The clouds of Ill and Night, For every soul which cometh to the earth; That beamest on us at our birth, And paling somewhat in life's grosser day, Lightest, a pillar of fire, our evening way; What matter by what Name We call Thee?‚Äîstill art Thou the same, God call we Thee, or Good,‚Äîstill through the strife Unchangeable alone, of all our changeful life, With awe-struck souls we seek Thee, we adore Thy greatness ever more and more, We turn to Thee with worship, till at last, Our journey well-nigh past, When now our day of Life draws to its end, Looking, with less of awe and more of love, To Thy high throne above, We see no dazzling brightness as of old, No kingly splendours cold, But the sweet Presence of a heavenly Friend. THE ODE OF EVIL. Oh, who shall sing of Life and not of Ill? The essence of our will Is fullest liberty to stray, From out the green and blessed way, Amid the desert wastes of drought and death. This is the power that makes us free, This of our Being is the penalty; And maybe the Eternal Will, Clothing itself with form to bid Creation be, Took to itself some boundary, and awhile, Self-limited, made vile And subjected to Law the Majesty Which all the Universe of Space did fill. Evil is Life, The conflict of great laws pervading space; Evil is strife, Which keeps the creature in its ordered place. If any hand divine should e'er with-draw The fixed coercive potency of Law, Surely the Universe of things would fade And cease and be unmade. Where Law is, there is Good, And freedom to obey or to transgress; Else 'twere no Law, but, weaker far and less, If one created soul might not the thing it would. Young lives spring up and fade, Wither and are opprest, Toil takes the world, and pain, And all the things that God has made Travail and groan and fain would be at rest, And Wrong prevails again. And we‚Äîwe lift a hopeless eye Up to the infinite sky, Mourning the Ill that is, and shall be yet, Weak creatures who forget The very law and root of Life, That it is sown in pain and nursed in woe and strife. The evil blight of war Torments the race from age to age, And man slays man through all the years that are, And savage lust and brutal rage Deform this glorious heritage of earth. We shudder and grow faint, Knowing the dim fair dreams of seer and saint Show thin and little worth. The young life, rising, sinks in sloughs of sense, And wanders and is lost. Alas! for days of young-eyed innocence. Alas! for the calm hours ere, passion-crost, The young soul grew, a white flower sweet and pure. Yet not the less 'tis sure That not in tranquil zones of endless calm Grows best the victor's palm, But blown by circling storms which blot the sky, Nor fitting were it to the eye Always to look upon a cloudless sun,‚Äî Grown blind with too much light before the journey done. The victories of Right Are born of strife. There were no Day were there no Night, Nor, without dying, Life. There only doth Right triumph, where the Wrong Is mightiest and most strong; There were no Good, indeed, were there no Ill. And when the final victory shall come, Burst forth, oh Awful Sun, and draw Creation home. Not within Time or Space Lines drawn in opposite ways grow one, But in some Infinite place Before the Eternal throne; There, ways to-day divergent, Right and Wrong, Approach the nearer that they grow more long. There at the Eternal feet, Fused, joined, and grown complete, The circle rounds itself, the enclosing wall Of the Universe sinks down, and God is all in all! THE ODE OF AGE. There is a sweetness in autumnal days, Which many a lip doth praise; When the earth, tired a little and grown mute Of song, and having borne its fruit, Rests for a little space ere winter come. It is not sad to turn the face towards home, Even though it shows the journey nearly done; It is not sad to mark the westering sun, Even though we know the imminent night doth come. Silence there is, indeed, for song, Twilight for noon; But for the steadfast soul and strong Life's autumn is as June. As June itself, but clearer, calmer far; Here come no passion-gusts to mar, No thunder-clouds or rains to beat To earth the blossoms and the wheat. No high tumultuous noise Of youth's self-seeking joys, But a cold radiance white As the moon shining on a frosty night. To-morrow is as yesterday, scant change, Little of new or strange, No glamour of false hope to daze, Nor glory to amaze, Even the old passionate love of love or child A temperate affection mild, And ever the recurring thought Returning, though unsought: How strange the Scheme of Things! how brief a span The little life of man! And ever as we mark them, fleeter and more fleet, The days and months and years, gliding with wing√®d feet. And ever as the hair grows grey, And the eyes dim, And the lithe form which toiled the live-long day, The stalwart limb, Begin to stiffen and grow slow, A higher joy we know: To spend the remnant of the waning year, Ere comes the deadly chill, In works of mercy, and to cheer The feet which toil against life's rugged hill! To have known the trouble and the fret, To have known it, and to cease In a pervading peace, Too calm to suffer pain, too living to forget, And reaching down a succouring hand To where the sufferers are, To lift them to the tranquil heights afar, Whereon Time's conquerors stand. And when the fruitful hours are done, How sweet at set of sun To gather up the fair laborious day!‚Äî To have struck some blow for right With tongue or pen; To have smoothed the path to light For wandering men; To have chased some fiend of Ill away; A little backward to have thrust The instant powers of Drink and Lust, To have borne down gaunt Despair, To have dealt a blow at Care! How sweet to light again the glow Of hotter fires than youth's, tho' the calm blood runs slow! Oh! is there any joy, Of all that come to girl or boy Or manhood's calmer weal and ease, To vie with these? Here is some fitting profit day by day Which naught can render less; Some glorious gain Fate cannot take away, Nor Time depress. Sad brother, fainting on your road! Poor sister, whom the righteous shun! There comes for you, ere life and strength be done, An arm to bear your load. A feeble body, maybe bent, and old, But bearing 'midst the chills of age A deeper glow than youth's; a nobler rage; A calm heart yet not cold. A man or woman, weak perhaps, and spent, To whom pursuit of gold or fame Is as a fire grown cold, an empty name, Whom thoughts of Love no more allure, Who in a self-made nunnery dwell, A cloistered calm and pure, A beatific peace greater than tongue can tell. And sweet it is to take, With something of the eager haste of youth, Some fainter glimpse of Truth For its own sake; To observe the ways of bee, or plant, or bird; To trace in Nature the ineffable Word, Which by the gradual wear of secular time, Has worked its work sublime; To have touched, with strenuous gropings dim, Nature's extremest outward rim; To have found some weed or shell unknown before; To advance Thought's infinite march a footpace more; To make or to declare laws just and sage; These are the joys of Age. Or by the evening hearth, in the old chair, With children's children at our knees, So like, yet so unlike the little ones of old‚Äî Some little lad with curls of gold, Some little maid demurely fair, To sit, girt round with ease, And feel how sweet it is to live, Careless what fate may give; To think, with gentle yearning mind Of dear souls who have crossed the Infinite Sea; To muse with cheerful hope of what shall be For those we leave behind When the night comes which knows no earthly morn; Yet mingled with the young in hopes and fears, And bringing from the treasure-house of years Some fair-set counsel long-time worn; To let the riper days of life, The tumult and the strife, Go by, and in their stead Dwell with the living past, so living, yet so dead: The mother's kiss upon the sleeper's brow, The little fish caught from the brook, The dead child-sister's gentle voice and look, The school-days and the father's parting hand; The days so far removed, yet oh! so near, So full of precious memories dear; The riddle of flying Time, so hard to understand! Not in keen eye or ear Dwells our chief profit here. We are not as the brutes, who fade and make no sign; We are sustained where'er we go, In happiness and woe, By some indwelling faculty divine, Which lifts us from the deep Of failing senses dim, and duller brain, And wafts us back to youth again; And as a vision fair dividing sleep, Pierces the vasts behind, the voids before, And opens to us an invisible gate, And sets our wing√®d footsteps, scorning Time and Fate, At the celestial door. THE ODE OF DECLINE. With forces well-nigh spent, Uneasy or in pain, Or brought to childish weakness once again, With bodies shrunk and bent, We come, if Fate so will, to cold decrepit age. The book of Life lies open at its latest page. Only four score of summers, and four score Of winters, nothing more, And then 'tis done. We have spent our fruitful days beneath the sun; We come to a cold season and a bare, Where little is sweet or fair. We, who a few brief years ago, Would passionately go Across the fields of life to meet the morn, We are content, content and not forlorn, To lie upon our beds, and watch the Day Which kissed the Eastern peaks, grow gradually grey. Great Heaven, that Thou hast made our lives so brief And swiftly spent! We toil our little day and are content, Though Time, the thief, Stands at our side, and smiles his mystic smile. We joy a little, we grieve a little while; We gain some little glimpse of Thy great laws, Rolling in thunder through the voids of space; We gain to look a moment on Thy face, Eternal Source and Cause! And then, the night descending as a cloud, We walk with aspect bowed, And turn to earth and see our Life grow dark. Was it for this the fiery spark Of Thy Eternal Self, sown on the vast And infinite abysses of the Past, Revealed itself and made Creation rise Before Thy Eternal Mind: This little span of life, with purblind eyes That grow completely blind; This little force of brain, Holding dim thoughts sublime, Too weak to withstand the treacheries of Time; This body bent and bowed in twain, Soon racked by growing pain, Which briefer far than is the life of the tree, Springs as a flower and fades, and then must rot And perish and be not, Passing from mystery to mystery? It is a pain To move through the old fields,‚Äîeven though they lie Before our eyes, we know that never again, Where once our daily feet were used to pass Amid the crested grass, We any more shall wander till we die; Nor to the old grey church, with the tall spire, Whose vane the sunsets fire, Where once a little child, by kind hands led, Would spell the scant memorials of the dead,‚Äî Never again, or once alone, When pain and Time are done. The soaring thoughts of youth Are dead and cold, the victories of Thought Are no more prized or sought By eyes which draw too near the face of Truth. Whatever fruit or gain Fate held in store To tempt the growing soul or brain, Allures no more. It is as the late Autumn, when the fields Are bare of flower or fruit; Nor charm nor profit the swept surface yields, Sullen and mute; So that a doubting mind might come to hold The very soul and life were dead and cold. But who can peer Into another soul, or tell at all What hidden energies befall The ag√®d lingering here? When all the weary brain Seems dull, the immeasurable fields of life Lie open to the memory, and again They know the youthful joys, the hurry and the strife, And feel, but gentlier now, the ancient pain. In the uneasy vigils of the night, Before the tardy light; Or, lonely days, when no young lives are by, There come such long processions of the dead, The buried lives and hopes of far-off years, Spent joys and dried-up tears, That round them stands a blessed company, Holding high converse, though no word be said, Till only what is past and gone doth seem To live, and all the Present is a dream. So may the wintry earth, Holding her precious seeds within the ground, Pause for the coming birth, When like a clarion-note the Spring shall sound; So may the roots which, buried deep And safe within her sleep, Whisper as 'twere, low down, tales of the sun,‚Äî Whisper of leaf and flower, of bee and bird,‚Äî Till by a sudden glory stirred, A mystic influence bids them rise, Bursting the narrow sheath And cerement of death, And bloom as lilies again beneath the recovered skies. THE ODE OF CHANGE. I have come to the time of the failing of breath; I have reached the cold threshold of Death! Death! there is not any Death; only infinite change, Only a place of life which is novel and strange. Change! there is naught but change and renewal of strife, Which make up the infinite changes we sum up in life. Life! what is life, that it ceases with ceasing of breath? Death! what were Life without change, but an infinite Death? As I lie on my bed, and the sun, like a furnace of fire, Burns amid the old pines in the west, ere the last ray expire, Can I dream he will rise no more, but a fathomless night Shall brood o'er Creation for ever, and shut out the light? It is done, this Day of our Life; but another shall rise, Day for ever following Day, in the infinite skies, Day following Day for ever! Day following day, with the starlit darkness between; Or, maybe in a world where Dawn comes, ere our sunset has been; Day following Day for ever! For ever! though who shall tell in what seeming or where? In what far-off secret space of God's limitless air? It matters nothing at all what we are or where set, If a spark of the Infinite Light can shine on us yet. Life following Life for ever! Life following Life for ever! for what if the Sun Grew chilled, and the Universe cold, and the orbits undone, And all the great globes should fall back into chaos once more; They would wake at a glance of the Light, as they wakened before. There is no Death for ever! Cease! but how should we cease while God's light shall remain? He that has lighted Life's flame shall light it again! What if He take back for a while, as the Sun from the Sea, Some spark of the radiance divine that bade all things to be? We rest in Him, we are sunk, we are folded in Him, but we are; As the star which draws near to the Sun is obscured, but is still a star. There is only Change for ever! Shall I fear that I shall be changed and no more shall be I?‚Äî I who know not what 'tis that I am, to live or to die? Nay, while God is, I too must be, else too weak were His hand; The created is part of His essence,‚Äîhow else could the Maker stand? There is no Death for ever! Take me, oh infinite Cause, and cleanse me of wrong! Take me, raise me to higher Being through centuries long! Cleanse me, by pain, if need be, through √¶ons of days! Take me and purge me, still I will answer with praise‚Äî There is no Death for ever! Shall I mourn for those who are not Nay, while love and regret Still linger within our souls, they live with us yet. If we love, then the souls that we love, they exist and they are, As memory which makes us ourselves, brings precious things from far. Love lives and is for ever! We are part of an Infinite Scheme, All we that are; Man the high crest and crown of things that be, The fiery-hearted earth, the cold unfathomed sea, The central sun, the intermittent star. Things great and small, We are but parts of the Eternal All; We live not in a barren, baseless dream; No endless, ineffectual chain Of chance successions launched in vain; But every beat of Time, Each sun that shines or fails to shine, Each animate life that comes to throb or cease, Each life of herb or tree Which blooms and fruits and then forgets to be, Each change of strife and peace, Each soaring thought sublime, Each deed of wrong and blood, Each impulse towards an unattain√®d good,‚Äî All with a sure, unfaltering working tend To one Ineffable, Beatific End. Oh hidden Scheme, perfect Thyself, and take Our petty lives, and mould them as Thou wilt! All things that are, are only for Thy sake, And not to obey Thee is our only guilt! Perfect Thyself, and be fulfilled, oh great Unfathomable Will, who art our Life and Fate! There is hope, but nothing of fear, Nought but a patient mind, For him who waits with conscience clear And soul resigned Whate'er the mystic coming change Shall bring of new and strange. He looks back once upon the fields of life, The good and evil locked in strife, The happy and the unhappy days, The Right we always love, the ofttriumphant Wrong; And all his Being to a secret song Sings with a mighty and unfaltering voice‚Äî ‚ÄúI have been; Thou hast done all things well; I am glad; I give thanks; I rejoice!‚Äù SONGS UNSUNG. PICTURES‚ÄîI. Above the abysmal undivided deep A train of glory streaming from afar; And in the van, to wake the worlds from sleep, One on whose forehead shines the Morning-Star. Long-rolling surges of a falling sea, Smiting the sheer cliffs of an unknown shore; And by a fanged rock, swaying helplessly A mast with broken cordage‚Äînothing more. Three peaks, one loftier, all in virgin white, Posied high in cloudland when the day is done, And on the mid-most, far above the night, The rose-red of the long-departed sun. A wild girl reeling, helpless, like to fall, Down a hushed street at dawn in midsummer; And one who had clean forgot their past and all, From a lit palace casement pities her. A young man, only clothed with youth's first bloom, In mien and form an angel, not in eye; Hard by, a fell worm crawling from a tomb, And one, wide-eyed, who cries, ‚ÄúThe Enemy!‚Äù A lake of molten fires which swell and surge And fall in thunders on the burning verge; And one a queen rapt, with illumined face, Who doth defy the Goddess of the place. Eros beneath a red-cupped tree, asleep, And 'mid the flowers, and thro' the air above, Fair boys with silver wings who smiling peep Upon the languid loosened limbs of love. A darkling gateway, thronged with entering ghosts, And a grave janitor, who seems to say: ‚ÄúWoe, woe to youth, to life, which idly boasts; I am the End, and mine the appointed Way.‚Äù A young Faun making music on a reed, Deep in a leafy dell in Arcady: Three girl-nymphs fair, in musing thought take heed Of the strange youth's mysterious melody. A flare of lamplight in a shameful place Full of wild revel and unchecked offence, And in the midst, one fresh scarce-sullied face, Within her eyes, a dreadful innocence. A quire of seraphs, chanting row on row, With lute and viol and high trumpet notes; And, above all, their soft young eyes aglow‚Äî Child angels, making laud from full clear throats. Some, on a cliff at dawn, in agony; Below, a scaly horror on the sea, Lashing the leaden surge. Fast-bound, a maid Waits on the verge, alone, but unafraid. A poisonous, dead, sad sea-marsh, fringed with pine, Scarce lit by mouldering churches, old as Time; Beyond, on high, just touched with wintry rime, The long chain of the autumnal Apennine. A god-like Presence, beautiful as Dawn, Watching, on some untrodden summit white, The Earth's last day grow full, and fade in night; Then, with a sigh, the Presence is withdrawn. A sheer rock-islet, frowning on the sea Where no ship sails, nor ever life may be: Thousands of leagues around, from pole to pole, The unbounded lonely ocean-currents roll. Young maids who wander on a flowerlit lawn, In springtide of their lives as of the year; Meanwhile, unnoticed, swift, a thing of fear, Across the sun, a deadly shadow drawn. Slow, hopeless, overborne, without a word, Two issuing, as if from Paradise; Behind them, stern, and with unpitying eyes, Their former selves, wielding a two-edged sword. A weary woman tricked with gold and gem, Wearing some strange barbaric diadem, Scorn on her lips, and, like a hidden fire, Within her eyes cruel unslaked desire. Two ag√®d figures, poor, and blurred with tears; Their child, a bold proud woman, sweeping by; A hard cold face, which pities not nor fears, And all contempt and evil in her eye. Around a harpsichord, a blue-eyed throng Of long-dead children, rapt in sounds devout, In some old grange, while on that silent song The sabbath twilight fades, and stars come out. The end of things created; Dreadful night, Advancing swift on sky, and earth, and sea; But at the zenith a departing light, A soaring countless blessed company! THE LESSON OF TIME. Lead thou me, Spirit of the World, and I Will follow where thou leadest, willingly; Not with the careless sceptic's idle mood, Nor blindly seeking some unreal good; For I have come, long since to that full day Whose morning mists have fled and curled away‚Äî That breathless afternoon-tide when the Sun Halts, as it were, before his journey done, Calm as a river broadening toward the main, Which never plunges down the rocks again, But, clearly mirrored in its tranquil deep, Holds tower and spire and forest as in sleep. How old and worn the metaphor appears, Old as the tale of passing hopes and fears! New as the springtide air, which day by day Breathes on young lives, and speeds them on their way. The Roman knew it, and the Hellene too; Assyrian and Egyptian proved it true; Who found for youth's young glory and its glow Serener life, and calmer tides run slow. And them oblivion takes, and those before, Whose very name and race we know no more, To whom, oh Spirit of the World and Man, Thou didst reveal Thyself when Time began,‚Äî They felt, as I, what none may under-stand; They touched through darkness on a hidden hand; They marked their hopes, their faiths, their longings fade, And found a solitude themselves had made; They came, as I, to hope which conquers doubt, Though sun and moon and every star go out; They ceased, while at their side a still voice said, ‚ÄúFear not, have courage; blessed are the dead.‚Äù They were my brothers‚Äîof one blood with me, As with the unborn myriads who shall be: I am content to rise and fall as they; I watch the dawning of the Perfect Day. Lead thou me, Spirit, willing and content To be, if thou wouldst have me, wholly spent. I am thine own, I neither strive nor cry: Stretch forth thy hand, I grasp it, silently. VENDREDI SAINT. This is Paris, the beautiful city, Heaven's gate to the rich, to the poor without pity. The clear sun shines on the fair town's graces, And on the cold green of the shrunken river, And the chill East blows, as 'twould blow for ever, On the holiday groups with their shining faces. For this is the one solemn day of the season, When all the swift march of her gay unreason Pauses a while, and a thin veil of sadness Half hides, from strange eyes, the old riot and madness, And the churches are crowded with devotees holy, Rich and poor, saint and sinner, the great and the lowly. Here is a roofless palace, where gape Black casements in rows without form or shape: A sordid ruin, whose swift decay Speaks of that terrible morning in May When the whole fair city was blood and fire, And the black smoke of ruin rose higher and higher, And through the still streets, 'neath the broad Spring sun, Everywhere murder and rapine were done; Women lurking, with torch in hand, Evil eyed, sullen, who soon should stand Before the sharp bayonets, dripping with blood, And be stabbed through and through, or shot dead where they stood. This is the brand-new H√¥tel de Ville, Where six hundred wretches met death in the fire; Ringed round with a pitiless cordon of steel, Not one might escape that swift vengeance. To-day The ruin, the carnage, are clean swept away; And the sumptuous facades, and the high roofs aspire, And, upon the broad square, the white palace face Looks down with a placid and meaningless grace, Ignoring the bloodshed, the struggle, the sorrow, The doom that has been, and that may be to-morrow, The hidden hatred, the mad endeavour, The strife that still is and shall be for ever. Here rise the twin-towers of Notre Dame, Through siege, and revolt, and ruin the same. See the people in crowds pressing onward, slowly, Along the dark aisles to the altar holy‚Äî The altar, to-day, wrapt in mourning and gloom, Since He whom they worship lies dead in the tomb. There, by a tiny acolyte tended, A round-cheeked child in his cassock white, Lies the tortured figure to which are bended The knees of the passers who gaze on the sight, And the people fall prostrate, and kiss and mourn The fair dead limbs which the nails have torn. And the passionate music comes from the quire, Full of soft chords of a yearning pity The mournful voices accordant aspire To the far-off gates of the Heavenly City; And the clear, keen alto, soaring high and higher, Mounts now a surging fountain, now a heavenward fire. Ay, eighteen centuries after the day, A world-worn populace kneel and pray, As they pass by and gaze on the limbs unbroken. What symbol is this? of what yearnings the token? What spell this that leads men a part to be Of this old Jud√¶an death-agony? And I asked, Was it naught but a Nature Divine, That for lower natures consented to die? Could a greater than human sacrifice, Still make the tears spring to the world-dimmed eye? One thought only it was that replied, and no other: This man was our brother. As I pass from the church, in the cold East wind, Leaving its solemn teachings behind: Once again, on the verge of the chill blue river, The blighted buds on the branches shiver; Here, again, stream the holiday groups, with delight Gaping in wonder at some new sight. 'Tis an open doorway, squalid and low, And crowds which ceaselessly come and Careless enough ere they see the sight Which leaves the gay faces pallid and white: Something is there which can change their mood, And check the holiday flow of the blood. For the face which they see is the face of Death. Strange, such a thing as the ceasing of breath Should work such miraculous change as here: Turn the thing that we love, to a thing of fear; Transform the sordid, the low, the mean, To a phantasm, pointing to Depths unseen. There they lie, the dead, unclaimed and unknown, Each on his narrow and sloping stone. The chill water drips from each to the ground; No other movement is there, nor sound. With the look which they wore when they came to die, They gaze from blind eyes on the pitiless sky. No woman to-day, thank Heaven, is here; But men, old for the most part, and broken quite, Who, finding this sad world a place of fear, Have leapt forth hopelessly into the night, Bankrupt of faith, without love, unfriended, Dead-tired of life's comedy ere 'twas ended. But here is one younger, whose ashy face Bears some faint shadow of former grace. What brought him here? was it love's sharp fever? Was she worse than dead that he bore to leave her? Or was his young life, ere its summer came, Burnt by Passion's whirlwinds as by a flame. Was it Drink or Desire, or the die's sure shame, Which led this poor truant to deep disgrace? Was it hopeless misfortune, unmixed with blame, That laid him here dead, in this dreadful place? Ah Heaven, of these nineteen long centuries, Is the sole fruit this thing with the sightless eyes! Yesterday, passion and struggle and strife, Hatreds, it may be, and anger-choked breath; Yesterday, fear and the burden of life; To day, the cold ease and the calmness of death: And that which strove and sinned and yielded there, To-day in what hidden place of God's mysterious air? Whatever he has been, here now he lies, Facing the stare of unpitying eyes. I turn from the dank and dishonoured face, To the fair dead Christ by his altar place, And the same thought replies to my soul, and no other‚Äî This, too, was our brother. ‚ÄúNO MORE, NO MORE.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo more, no more,‚Äù the autumnal shadows cry; ‚ÄúNo more, no more,‚Äù our failing hearts reply: Oh! that our lives were come to that calm shore Where change is done, and fading is no more. But should some mightier hand completion send, And smooth life's stream unrippled to its end, Our sated souls, filled with an aching pain, Would yearn for fleeting days and years again. Thrice bless√®d be the salutary change Which day by day brings thoughts and feelings strange! Our gain is loss, we keep but what we give, And only daily dying may we live. THE NEW CREED. Yesterday, to a girl I said‚Äî ‚ÄúI take no pity on the unworthy dead, The wicked, the unjust, the vile who die; 'Twere better thus that they should rot and lie. The sweet, the lovable, the just Make holy dust; Elsewhere than on the earth Shall come their second birth. Until they go each to his destined place, Whether it be to bliss or to disgrace, 'Tis well that both should rest, and for a while be dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is nowhere else,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere is nowhere else.‚Äù And this was a girl's voice Who, some short tale of summers gone to-day, Would carelessly rejoice, As life's blithe springtide passed upon its way And all youth's infinite hope and bloom Shone round her; nor might any shadow of gloom Fall on her as she passed from flower to flower; Love sought her, with full dower Of happy wedlock and young lives to rear; Nor shed her eyes a tear, Save for some passing pity, fancy-bred. All good things were around her‚Äîriches, love, All that the heart and mind can move, The precious things of Art, the undefiled And innocent affection of a child. Oh girl, who sunny ways alone dost tread, What curse is this that blights thy comely head? For right or wrong there is no further place than here, No sanctities of hope, no chastening fear? ‚ÄúThere is nowhere else,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere is nowhere else,‚Äù and in the wintry ground When we have laid the darlings of our love‚Äî The little lad with eyes of blue, The little maid with curls of gold, Or the belov√®d ag√®d face On which each passing year stamps a diviner grace‚Äî That is the end of all, the narrow bound. Why look our eyes above To an unreal home which mortal never knew‚Äî Fold the hands on the breast, the clay-cold fingers fold? No waking comes there to the uncaring dead! ‚ÄúThere is nowhere else,‚Äù she said. Strange; is it old or new, this deep distress? Or do the generations, as they press Onward for ever, onward still, Finding no truth to fill Their starving yearning souls, from year to year Feign some new form of fear To fright them, some new terror Couched on the path of error, Some cold and desolate word which, like a blow, Forbids the current of their faith to flow, Makes slow their pulse's eager beat, And, chilling all their wonted heat, Leaves them to darkling thoughts and dreads a prey, Uncheered by dawning shafts or setting ray? Ah, old it is, indeed, and nowise new, This is the poison-growth that grew In the old thinker's fancy-haunted ground. They, blinded by some keen too-vivid gleam Of the Unseen, to which all things did seem To shape themselves and tend, Solved, by some Giant Force, the Mystery of Things, And, soaring all too high on Fancy's wings, Saw in dead matter both their Source and End. They felt the self-same shock and pain As I who hear these prattlings cold today. Not otherwise of old the fool to his heart did say. ‚ÄúThere is no other place of joy or grief, Nor wrong in doubt, nor merit in belief: There is no God, nor Lord of quick and dead; There is nowhere else,‚Äù they said. And, indeed, if any to whom life's path were rough Should say as you, he had cause maybe at sight. Truly, the way is steep and hard enough, And wrong is tangled and confused with right; And from all the world there goes a solemn sound Of lamentations, rising from the ground, Confused as that which shocks the wondering ear Of one who, gliding on the still lagune, Finds the oar's liquid plash and tune Lost in wild cries of frenzy and of fear, And knows the Isle of Madness drawing near; And the great scheme, if scheme there be indeed, Is a book deeper than our eyes may read, Full of wild paradox, and vain endeavour, And hopes and faiths which find completion never. For such a one, in seasons of dismay And dark depression deepening to despair, Clouds come ofttimes to veil the face of day, And there is no ray left of all the beams of gold, The glow, the radiance bright, the unclouded faith of old. But you, poor child forlorn, Ah! better were it you were never born; Better that you had flung your heart away On some coarse lump of clay; Better defeat, disgrace, childlessness, all That can a solitary life befall, Than to have all things and yet be Self-bound to dark despondency, And self-tormented, beyond reach of doubt, By some cold word that puts all yearnings out. ‚ÄúThere is nowhere else,‚Äù she said: This is the outcome of their crude Belief Who are, beyond all rescue and relief, Being self-slain and numbered with the dead. ‚ÄúThere is no God but Force, Which, working always on its destined course, Speeds on its way and knows no thought of change. Within the germ the molecule fares free, Holding the potency of what shall be; Within the little germ lurks the heaven-reaching tree: No break is there in all the cosmic show. What place is there, in all the Scheme Immense, For a remote unworking Excellence Which may not be perceived by any sense, Which makes no humble blade of grass to grow, Which adds no single link to things and thoughts we know?‚Äù ‚ÄúFor everything that is, indeed, Bears with it its own seed; It cannot change or cease and be no more: All things for ever are even as they were before, Or if, by long degrees and slow, More complex doth the organism grow, It makes no break in the eternal plan; There is no gulf that yawns between the herb and man.‚Äù Poor child, what is it they have taught, Who through deep glooms and desert wastes of thought Have brought to such as you their dreary creed? Have they no care, indeed, For all the glorious gains of man's long past, For all our higher hope of what shall be at last? ‚ÄúAll things are moulded in one mould; They spring, they are, they fade by one compulsion cold‚Äî Some dark necessity we cannot know, Which bids them wax and grow,‚Äî That is sufficient cause for all things, quick and dead!‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no Cause else,‚Äù she said. Oh, poor indeed, and in evil case, Who shouldst be far from sound of doubt As a maiden in some restful place Whose tranquil life, year in year out, Is built on gentle worship, homely days Lit each by its own light of prayer and praise, For whom the spire points always to the sky, And heaven lies open to the cloistered eye. For us, for us, who mid the weary strife And jangling discords of our life Are day by day opprest, 'Twere little wonder were our souls distrest, God, and the life to be, and all our early trust Being far from us expelled and thrust; But for you, child, who cannot know at all To what mysterious laws we stand or fall, To what bad heights the wrong within may grow, To what dark depths the stream of hopeless lives may flow! For let the doubter cavil as he can, There is no wit in man Which can make Force rise higher still Up to the heights of Will,‚Äî No phase of Force which finite minds can know Can self-determined grow, And of itself elect what shall its essence be: The same to all eternity, Unchanged, unshaped, it goes upon its blinded way; Nor can all forces nor all laws Bring ceasing to the scheme, nor any pause, Nor shape it to the mould in which to be‚Äî Form from the wing√®d seed the myriad-branching tree,‚Äî Nor guide the force once sped, so that it turn To Water-floods that quench or Fires that burn, Or now to the electric current change, Or draw all things by some attraction strange. Or in the brain of man, working unseen, sublime, Transcend the narrow bounds of Space and Time. Whence comes the innate Power which knows to guide The force deflected so from side to side, That not a barren line from whence to where It goes upon its way through the unfettered air? What launched the prisoned atom on its fruitful course? Ah, it was more than Force Which gave the Universe of things its form and face! Force moving on its path through Time and Space Would round no orb, but leave all barren still. A higher Power, it was, the worlds could form and fill; And by some pre-existent harmony Were all things made as Fate would have them be‚Äî Fate, the ineffable Word of an Eternal Will. All things that are or seem, Whether we wake who see or do but dream, Are of that Primal Will phantasms, if no more; Who sees these right sees God, and seeing doth adore. Joy, suffering, evil, good, Whate'er our daily food, Whate'er the mystery and paradox of things, Low creeping thoughts and high imaginings. The laughters of the world, the age-long groan, Bring to his mind one name, one thought alone; All beauty, right, deformity, or wrong, Sing to his ear one high unchanging song; And everything that is, to his rapt fancy brings The hidden beat through space of the Eternal Wings. Where did the Idea dwell, At first, which was of all the germ and seed? Which worked from Discord order, from blind Force Sped all the Cosmos on its upward course? Which held within the atom and the cell The whole vast hidden Universe, sheltered well, Till the hour came to unfold it, and the need? What did the ever-upward growth conceive, Which from the obedient monad formed the herb, the tree, The animal, the man, the high growths that shall be? Ever from simpler to more complex grown, The long processions from a source unknown Unfold themselves across the scene of life. Oh bless√®d struggle and strife, Fare onward to the end, since from a Source Thou art, which doth transcend and doth determine Force! Fare onward to the end; not from Force, dead and blind Thou comest, but from the depths of the Creative Mind. Fare on to the end, but how should ending be, If Will be in the Universe, and plan? Some higher thing shall be, that which to-day is Man. Undying is each cosmic force: Undying, but transformed, it runs its endless course. It cannot wane, or sink, or be no more. Not even the dust and lime which clothe us round Lose their own substance in the charnel-ground, Or carried far upon the weltering wind; Only with other growths combined, In some new whole they are for ever‚Äî They are, and perish never. The great suns shed themselves in heat and light On the vast vacant interstellar air, Till when their scattered elements unite They are replenished as before they were. Nothing is lost, nor can be: change alone, Unceasing, never done, Shapes all the forms of things, and keeps them still Obedient to the Unknown Perfect Will. And shall the life that is the highest that we know, Shall this, alone, no more increase, expand and grow? Nay, somewhere else there is, although we know not where, Nor what new shape God gives our lives to wear. We are content, whatever it shall be: Content, through all eternity, To be whatever the Spirit of the World deems best;‚Äî Content to be at rest; Content to work and fare through end less days; Content to spend ourselves in endless praise: Nay, if it be the Will Divine, Content to be, and through long lives to pine, Far from the light which vivifies, the fire Which breathes upon our being and doth inspire All soaring thoughts and hopes which light our pathway here; Content, though with some natural thrill of fear, To be purged through by age-long pain, Till we resume our upward march again; Content, at need, to take some lower form, Some humbler herb or worm To be awhile, if e'er the eternal plan Go back from higher to lower, from man to less than man. Not so, indeed, we hold, but rather this‚Äî That all Time gone, that all that was or is, The scarp√®d cliff, the illimitable Past, This truth alone of all truths else hold fast:‚Äî From lower to higher, from simple to complete, This is the pathway of the Eternal Feet; From earth to lichen, herb to flowering tree, From cell to creeping worm, from man to what shall be. This is the solemn lesson of all time, This is the teaching of the voice sublime: Eternal are the worlds, and all that them doth fill; Eternal is the march of the Creative Will; Eternal is the life of man, and sun, and star; Ay, even though they fade a while, they are; And though they pause from shining, speed for ever still. A GREAT GULPH. If any tender sire Who sits girt round by loving faces And happy childhood's thousand graces, Through sudden crash or fire Should 'scape from this poor life to some mysterious air, And, dwelling solitary there, Feel his unfilled and yearning father's heart Pierced through by some intolerable smart; And, sickening for the dear lost lives again, Through his o'ermastering pain Should break the awful bonds the Eternal sets between That which lives Here, and There, the Seen and the Unseen; And having gained once more This little Earth, should reach the scarce-left place Which greets him with unchanged familiar face‚Äî The well-remembered door, The rose he watered blooming yet, Naught to remember or forget, No change in all the world except in him, Nor there save in some sense already dim Before the unaltered past, so that he seem A mortal spirit still, and what was since, a dream; And in the well-known room Finds all the blithe remembered faces Grown sad and blurred by recent traces Of a new sorrow and gloom, And when his soul to comfort them is fain Mourns his voice mute, his form unknown, unseen, And thinks with irrepressible pain Of all the happy days which late have been, And feels his new life's inmost chambers stirred If only of his own, he might be seen or heard; Then if, at length, The father's yearning and o'erburdened soul Burst into shape and voice which scorn control Of its despairing strength,‚Äî Ah Heaven! ah pity for the present dread Which rising, strikes the old affection dead! Ah, better were it far than this thing to remain, Voiceless, unseen, unloved, for ever and in pain! So when a finer mind, Knowing its old self swept by some weird change And the old thought deceased, or else grown strange, Turns to those left behind, With passionate stress and mighty yearning stirred,‚Äî It strives to stand revealed in shape and word In vain; or by strong travail visible grown, Finds but a world estranged, and lives and dies alone! ONE DAY. One day, one day, our lives shall seem Thin as a brief forgotten dream: One day, our souls by life opprest, Shall ask no other boon than rest. And shall no hope nor longing come, No memory of our former home, No yearning for the loved, the dear Dead lives that are no longer here? If this be age, and age no more Recall the hopes, the fears of yore, The dear dead mother's accents mild, The lisping of the little child, Come, Death, and slay us ere the blood Run slow, and turn our lives from good; For only in such memories we Consent to linger and to be. SEASONS. The colds winds rave on the icy river, The leafless branches complain and shiver, The snow clouds sweep on, to a dreary tune,‚Äî Can these be the earth and the heavens of June?‚Äî When the blossoming trees gleam in virginal white, And heaven's gate opens wide in the lucid night, And there comes no sound on the perfumed air But the passionate brown bird, carolling fair, And the lush grass in upland and lowland stands deep, And the loud landrail lulls the children to sleep, And the white still road and the thick leaved wood Are haunted by fanciful solitude; And by garden and lane men and maidens walk, Busied with trivial, loverlike talk; And the white and the red rose, newly blown, Open, each with a perfume and grace of its own. The cold wind sweeps o'er the desolate hill, The stream is bound fast and the wolds are chill; And by the dead flats, where the cold blasts moan, A bent body wearily plods alone. THE PATHOS OF ART. Oft, seeing the old painters' art, We find the tear unbidden start, And feel our full hearts closer grow To the far days of long ago. Not burning faith, or godlike pain, Can thus our careless thought enchain; The heavenward gaze of souls sublime, At once transcends, and conquers time. Nor pictured form of seer or saint, Which hands inspired delight to paint; Art's highest aims of hand or tongue, Age not, but are for ever young. But some imperfect trivial scene, Of homely life which once has been, Of youth, so soon to pass away, Of happy childhood's briefer day; Or humble daily tasks portrayed‚Äî The thrifty mistress with her maid; The flowers, upon the casement set, Which in our Aprils blossom yet; The long processions, never done; The time-worn palace, scarce begun; The gondolier, who plies his oar For stately sirs or dames of yore; The girl with fair hair morning-stirred, Who swings the casement for her bird; The hunt; the feast; the simple mirth Which marks the marriage or the birth; The burly forms, from side to side Careering on the frozen tide; The long-haired knights; the ladies prim; The chanted madrigal or hymn; The opera, with its stately throng; The twilight church aisles stretching long; The spires upon the wooded wold; The dead pathetic life of old;‚Äî These all the musing mind can fill‚Äî So dead, so past, yet living still: Oh dear dead lives, oh hands long gone, Whose Life, whose Art still lingers on! IN THE STRAND. In the midst of the busy and roaring Strand, Dividing life's current on either hand, A time-worn city church, sombre and grey, Waits, while the multitude passes away. Beside it, a strait plot of churchyard ground Is fenced by a time-worn railing around; And within, like a pavement, the ground is spread With the smooth worn stones of the nameless dead. But here and there, in the spaces between, When the slow Spring bursts, and the fields grow green, Every year that comes, 'mid the graves of the dead Some large-leaved flower-stem lifts up its head. In the Spring, though as yet the sharp East be here, This green stem burgeons forth year after year: Through twenty swift summers and more, have I seen This tender shoot rise from its sheath of green. New busy crowds pass on with hurrying feet, The young lives grow old and the old pass away; But unchanged, 'mid the graves, at the fated day, The green sheath bursts upwards and grows complete. From the grave it bursts forth, 'mid the graves it shall die, It shall die as we die, as it lives we shall live; And this poor flower has stronger assurance to give, Than volumes of learning, which blunder or lie. For out of the dust and decay of the tomb, It springs, the sun calling, to beauty and bloom; And amid the sad city, 'mid death and 'mid strife, It preaches its mystical promise of life. C≈íLUM NON ANIMUM. Oh fair to be, oh sweet to be In fancy's shallop faring free, With silken sail and fairy mast To float till all the world be past! On happy fortune, on and on To wander far till care be gone, Round beetling capes, to unknown seas, Seeking the fair Hesperides! But is there any land or sea Where toil and trouble cease to be‚Äî Some dim, unfound, diviner shore, Where men may sin and mourn no more? Ah, not the feeling, but the sky We change, however far we fly; How swift soe'er our bark may speed, Faster the blessed isles recede. Nay, best it is at home to find Food for the labouring heart and mind, And take, since thus the world grows fair, Duty and pleasure everywhere. Oh well-worn road, oh homely way, Where pace our footsteps, day by day, The homestead and the church which bound The tranquil seasons' circling round! Ye hold experiences which reach Depths which no change of skies can teach, The saintly thought, the secret strife Which guide, which do perturb our life. PICTURES‚ÄîII. A lurid sunset, red as blood, Firing a sombre, haunted wood; From whose recesses, dark and fell, One hurries with a face of Hell. Two at a banquet board alone, In dalliance, the feast being done. And one behind the arras stands, Grasping an axe with quivering hands. A high cliff-meadow lush with Spring; Gay butterflies upon the wing; Beneath, beyond, unbounded, free, The foam-flecked, blue, pervading sea. A clustering hill-town, climbing white From the grey olives up the height, And higher on the glaring sky A huge sierra, dead and dry. A rain-swept moor at shut of day, And by the dead unhappy way A lonely child untended lies: Against the West a wretch who flies. Cold dawn, which flouts the abandoned hall, And one worn face, which loathes it all; In his ringed hand a vial, while The grey lips wear a ghastly smile. Corinthian pillars fine, which stand In moonlight on a desert sand; Others o'erthrown, in whose dark shade Some fire-eyed brute its lair has made. Mountainous clouds embattled high Around a dark blue lake of sky; And from its clear depths, shining far, The calm eye of the evening star. A moonlight chequered avenue; Above, a starlit glimpse of blue: And from the thick-laced shade between The grey ghost of a woman seen. A NIGHT IN NAPLES. This is the one night in all the year When the faithful in Naples who love their priest May find their faith and their wealth increased; For just as the stroke of midnight is here, Those who with faithful undoubting mind Their ‚ÄúAves‚Äù mutter, their rosaries tell, They without doubt shall a recompense find; Yea, their faith indeed shall profit them well. Therefore, to-night, in the hot thronged street By San Gennaro's, the people devout, With banner, and relic, and thurible meet, With some sacred image to marshal them out. For a few days hence, the great lottery Of the sinful city declared will be, And it may be that Aves and Paters said Will bring some aid from the realms of the dead. And so to the terrible place of the tomb They issue, a pitiful crowd, through the gloom, To where all the dead of the city decay, Waiting the trump of the judgment day. For every day of the circling year Brings its own sum of corruption here; Every day has its great pit, fed With its dreadful heap of the shroudless dead. And behind a grated rust-eaten door, Marked each with their fated month and day, The young and the old, who in life were poor, Fester together and rot away. Silence is there, the silence of death, And in silence these poor pilgrims wearily pace, And the wretched throng, pitiful, holding its breath, Comes with shambling steps to the dreadful place. Till before those dark portals, the muttering crowd Breaks at length into passionate suffrages loud, Waiting the flickering vapour thin, Bred of the dreadful corruption within. And here is a mother who kneels, not in woe, By the vault where her child was flung months ago; And there is a strong man who peers with dry eyes At the mouth of the gulph where his dead wife lies. Till at last, to reward them, a faint blue fire, Like the ghost of a soul, flickers here or there At the gate of a vault, on the noisome air, And the wretched throng has its low desire; And with many a praise of favouring saint, And curses if any refuses to heed, Full of low hopes and of sordid greed, To the town they file backward, weary and faint. And a few days hence, the great lottery Of the sinful city declared will be, And a number thus shown to those sordid eyes, May, the saints being willing, attain the prize. Wherefore to Saint and Madonna be said, All praise and laud, and the faithful dead! It was long, long ago, in far-off Jud√¶a, That they slew Him of old, whom these slay to-day; They slew Him of old, in far-off Jud√¶a,‚Äî It is long, long ago; it was far, far away! LIFE. Like to a star, or to a fire, Which ever brighter grown, or higher, Doth shine forth fixed, or doth aspire; Or to a glance, or to a sigh; Or to a low wind whispering by, Which scarce has risen ere it die; Or to a bird, whose rapid flight Eludes the dazed observer's sight, Or a stray shaft of glancing light, That for an instant breaks the gloom Which wraps some dark, forgotten tomb, Or some sweet Spring-flower's fleeting bloom;‚Äî Mixed part of reason, part belief, Of pain and pleasure, joy and grief, As changeful as the Spring, and brief;‚Äî A wave, a shadow, a breath, a strife, With change on change for ever rife!‚Äî This is the thing we know as life. CRADLED IN MUSIC. A bright young mother, day by day, I meet upon the crowded way, Who turns her dark eyes, deep and mild, Upon her little sleeping child. For on the organ laid asleep, In childish slumbers light, yet deep, Calmly the rosy infant lies; The long fair lashes veil his eyes. O'er that untroubled dreamtide sweet The swift hours steal with noiseless feet; Far off the music seems to cheer The child's accustomed drowsy ear. Hymn-tune and song-tune, grave and gay, Comfort him all the joyous day; And, half remembered, faintly seen To mingle with each happy dream. Poor child, for whom the summer long Our dull hours slip by, winged with song; Sleeping for half the tuneful day, Waking 'neath loving looks to play; Whose innocent eyes unconscious see Nothing but mirth in misery. Thy mother smiles, thy sister stands Smiling, the tambour in her hands. And with the time of hard-earned rest, 'Tis thine to press that kindly breast; Nor dream of all the toil, the pain, The weary round begun again,‚Äî The fruitless work, the blow, the curse, The hunger, the contempt, or worse; The laws despite, the vague alarms, Which pass not those protecting arms. Only, as yet, 'tis thine to know The bright young faces all aglow, As down the child-encumbered street The music stirs the lightsome feet, Only to crow and smile, as yet. Soon shall come clouds, and cold, and wet; And where the green leaves whisper now, The mad East flinging sleet and snow. And if to childhood thou shalt come‚Äî Childhood that knows not hearth or home,‚Äî Coarse words maybe, and looks of guile, Shall chase away that constant smile. Were it not better, child, than this, The burden of full life to miss; And now, while yet the time is May, Amid the music pass away. And leave the dissonant cries of wrong For the immortal, perfect song; And take the changeless heavenly life For earth's poor vagrant toil and strife; And keep, within those opened skies, A vision of thy mother's eyes; And hear those old strains, faint and dim, Grown fine, within the eternal hymn? Nay, whatsoe'er our thought may deem, Not that is better which may seem; 'Twere better that thou camest to be, If Fate so willed, in misery. What shall be, shall be‚Äîthat is all; To one great Will we stand and fall. ‚ÄúThe Scheme hath need‚Äù‚Äîwe ask not why, And in this faith we live and die. ODATIS. AN OLD LOVE-TALE. Chares of Mytilen√©, ages gone, When the young Alexander's conquering star Flamed on the wondering world, being indeed The comrade of his arms, from the far East Brought back this story of requited love. A Prince there was of Media, next of blood To the great King Hystaspes, fair of form As brave of soul, who to his flower of age Was come, but never yet had known the dart Of Cypris, being but a soldier bold, Too much by trench√®d camps and wars' alarms Engrossed, to leave a thought for things of love. Now, at this selfsame time, by Tanais Omartes ruled, a just and puissant king. No son was his, only one daughter fair, Odatis, of whose beauty and whose worth Fame filled the furthest East. Only as yet, Of all the suitors for her hand, came none Who touched her maiden heart; but, fancy-free, She dwelt unwedded, lonely as a star. Till one fair night in springtide, when the heart Blossoms as does the earth, Cypris, the Queen, Seeing that love is sweet for all to taste, And pitying these loveless parted lives, Deep in the sacred silence of the night, From out the ivory gate sent down on them A happy dream, so that the Prince had sight Of fair Odatis in her diadem And habit as she lived, and saw the charm And treasure of her eyes, and knew her name And country as it was; while to the maid There came a like fair vision of the Prince Leading to fight the embattled Median hosts, Young, comely, brave, clad in his panoply And pride of war, so strong, so fair, so true, That straight, the virgin coldness of her soul Melted beneath the vision, as the snow In springtime at the kisses of the sun. And when they twain awoke to common day From that blest dream, still on their tranc√®d eyes The selfsame vision lingered. He an essence Lovelier than all his life had known, more pure And precious than all words; she a strong soul Yet tender, comely with the fire, the force Of youthful manhood; saw both night and day. Nor ever from their mutual hearts the shape Of that celestial vision waned nor grew Faint with the daily stress of common life, As do our mortal phantasies, but still He, while the fiery legions clashed and broke, Saw one sweet face above the flash of spears; She in high palace pomps, or house-hold tasks, Or 'mid the glittering courtier-crowded halls Saw one brave ardent gaze, one manly form. Now while in dreams of love these lovers lived Who never met in waking hours, who knew not Whether with unrequited love they burned, or whether In mutual yearnings blest; the King Omartes, Grown anxious for his only girl, and knowing How blest it is to love, would bid her choose Whom she would wed, and summoning the maid, With fatherly counsels pressed on her; but she: ‚ÄúFather, I am but young; I prithee, ask not That I should wed; nay, rather let me live My life within thy house. I cannot wed. I can love only one, who is the Prince Of Media, but I know not if indeed His love is his to give, or if he know My love for him; only a heavenly vision, Sent in the sacred silence of the night, Revealed him to me as I know he is. Wherefore, my father, though thy will be law, Have pity on me; let me love my love, If not with recompense of love, alone; For I can love none else.‚Äù Then the King said: ‚ÄúDaughter, to me thy happiness is life, And more; but now, I pray thee, let my words Sink deep within thy mind. Thou canst not know If this strange vision through the gate of truth Came or the gate of error. Oftentimes The gods send strong delusions to ensnare Too credulous hearts. Thou canst not know, in sooth, If 'twas the Prince thou saw'st, or, were it he, If love be his to give; and if it were, I could not bear to lose thee, for indeed I have no son to take my place, or pour Libations on my tomb, and shouldst thou wed A stranger, and be exiled from thy home, What were my life to me? Nay, daughter, dream No more, but with some chieftain of my realm Prepare thyself to wed. With the new moon A solemn banquet will I make, and bid Whate'er of high descent and generous youth Our country holds. There shalt thou make thy choice Of whom thou wilt, nor will I seek to bind Thy unfettered will; only I fain would see thee In happy wedlock bound, and feel the touch Of childish hands again, and soothe my age With sight of thy fair offspring round my knees.‚Äù Then she, because she loved her sire and fain Would do his will, left him without a word, Obedient to his hest; but day and night The one unfading image of her dream Filled all her longing sight, and day and night The semblance of her Prince in all the pride And bravery of battle shone on her. Nor was there any strength in her to heal The wound which love had made, by reasonings cold, Or musing on the phantasies of sleep; But still the fierce dart of the goddess burned Within her soul, as when a stricken deer O'er hill and dale escaping bears with her The barb within her side; and oft alone Within her secret chamber she would name The name of him she loved, and oft by night, When sleep had bound her fast, her pale lips formed The syllables of his name. Through the long hours, Waking or sleeping, were her thoughts on him; So that the quenchless yearning long deferred Made her heart sick, and like her heart, her form Wasted, her fair cheek paled, and from her eyes Looked out the silent suffering of her soul. Now, when the day drew near which brought the feast, One of her slaves, who loved her, chanced to hear Her sweet voice wandering in dreams, and caught The Prince's name; and, being full of grief And pity for her pain, and fain to aid The gentle girl she loved, made haste to send A messenger to seek the Prince and tell him How he was loved, and when the feast should be, And how the King would have his daughter wed. But to the Princess would she breathe no word Of what was done, till, almost on the eve Of the great feast, seeing her wan and pale And all unhappy, falling at her knees, She, with a prayer for pardon, told her all. But when the Princess heard her, virgin shame‚Äî Love drawing her and Pride of Maiden-hood In opposite ways till all distraught was she‚Äî Flushed her pale cheek, and lit her languid gaze. Yet since she knew that loving thought alone Prompted the deed, being soft and pitiful, She bade her have no fear, and though at first Unwilling, by degrees a newborn hope Chased all her shame away, and once again A long unwonted rose upon her cheek Bloomed, and a light long vanished fired her eyes. Meanwhile upon the plains in glorious war The brave Prince led his conquering hosts; but still, Amid the shock of battle and the crash Of hostile spears, one vision filled his soul. Amid the changes of the hard-fought day, Throughout the weary watches of the night, The dream, the happy dream, returned again; Always the selfsame vision of a maid Fairer than earthly, filled his eyes and took The savour from the triumph, ay, and touched The warrior's heart with an unwonted ruth, So that he shrank as never yet before From every day's monotony of blood, And saw with unaccustomed pain the sum Of death and woe, and hopeless shattered lives, Because a softer influence touched his soul. Till one night, on the day before the feast Which King Omartes destined for his peers, While now his legions swept their conquering way A hundred leagues or more from Tanais, There came the message from the slave, and he Within his tent, after the well-fought day, Resting with that fair image in his eyes, Woke suddenly to know that he was loved. Then, in a moment, putting from him sleep And well-earned rest, he bade his charioteer Yoke to his chariot three unbroken colts Which lately o'er the endless Scythian plain Careered, untamed; and, through the sleeping camp, Beneath the lucid aspect of the night, He sped as speeds the wind. The great stars hung Like lamps above the plain; the great stars sank And faded in the dawn; the hot red sun Leapt from the plain; noon faded into eve; Again the same stars lit the lucid night; And still, with scarce a pause, those fierce hoofs dashed Across the curved plain onward, till he saw Far off the well-lit palace casements gleam Wherein his love was set. Then suddenly He checked his panting team, the rapid wheels Ceased, and his mail and royal garb he hid Beneath a rich robe such as nobles use By Tanais; and to the lighted hall He passed alone, bidding his charioteer Await him in the darkness by the gate. Now, when the Prince drew near the vestibule, The feast long time had sped, and all the guests Had eaten and drunk their fill; and he unseen, Through the close throng of serving men and maids Around the door, like some belated guest To some obscurer station slipped, and took The wine-cup with the rest, who marvelled not To see him come, nor knew him; only she Who sent the message whispered him a word: ‚ÄúHave courage; she is there, and cometh soon. Be brave: she loves thee only; watch and wait.‚Äù Even then the King Omartes, where he sate On high among his nobles, gave command To summon from her maiden chamber forth The Princess. And obedient to the call, Robed in pure white, clothed round with maiden shame, Full of vague hope and tender yearning love, To the high royal throne Odatis came. And when the Prince beheld the maid, and saw The wonder which so long had filled his soul‚Äî His vision of the still night clothed with life And breathing earthly air‚Äîand marked the heave Of her white breast, and saw the telltale flush Crimson her cheek with maiden modesty, Scarce could his longing eager arms forbear To clasp the virgin round, so fair she seemed. But, being set far down from where the King Sat high upon the da√Øs 'midst the crowd Of eager emulous faces looking love, None marked his passionate gaze, or stretched-forth hands; Till came a pause, which hushed the deep-drawn sigh Of admiration, as the jovial King, Full tender of his girl, but flushed with wine, Spake thus to her: ‚ÄúDaughter, to this high feast Are bidden all the nobles of our land. Now, therefore, since to wed is good, and life To the unwedded woman seems a load Which few may bear, and none desire, I prithee, This jewelled chalice taking, mingle wine As well thou knowest, and the honeyed draught Give to some noble youth of those thou seest Along the well-ranged tables, knowing well That him to whom thou givest, thou shalt wed. I fetter not thy choice, girl. I grow old; I have no son to share the weight of rule, And fain would see thy children ere I die.‚Äù Then, with a kiss upon her blushing cheek, He gave the maid the cup. The cressets' light Fell on the jewelled chalice, which gave back A thousand answering rays. Silent she stood A moment, half in doubt, then down the file Of close-ranked eager faces flushed with hope, And eyes her beauty kindled more than wine, Passed slow, a breathing statue. Her white robe Among the purple and barbaric gold Showed like the snowy plumage of a dove, As down the hall, the cup within her hands, She, now this way regarding and now that, Glided, a burning blush upon her cheek; And on each youthful noble her large eyes Rested a moment only, icy cold, Though many indeed were there, brave, fair to see, Fit for a maiden's love; but never at all The one o'ermastering vision of her dream Rose on her longing eyes, till hope itself Grew faint, and, ere she gained the end, she turned Sickening to where, along the opposite wall, Sat other nobles young and brave as those, But not the fated vision of her dream. Meanwhile the Prince, who 'mid the close-set throng Of humbler guests was hidden, saw her come And turn ere she had marked him, and again Down the long line of princely revellers Pass slow as in a dream; and all his soul Grew sick with dread lest haply, seeing not The one expected face, and being meek And dutiful, and reverent to her sire, She in despair might make some sudden choice And leave him lovelorn. And where'er she went He could not choose but gaze, as oft in sleep Some dreadful vision chains us that we fail To speak or move, though to be still seem death. And once he feared that she had looked on him And passed, and once he thought he saw her pause By some tall comely youth; and then she reached The furthest wall, and as she turned her face And came toward him again to where the jars Of sweet wine stood for mingling, with a bound His heart went out to her; for now her cheek As pale and lifeless as the icy moon, And the dead hope within her eyes, and pain Of hardly conquered tears, made sure his soul, Knowing that she was his. But she, dear heart, Being sick indeed with love, and in despair, Yet reverencing her duty to her sire, Turned half-distraught to fill the fated cup And with it mar her life. But as she stood Alone within the vestibule and poured The sweet wine forth, slow, trembling, blind with tears, A voice beside her whispered, ‚ÄúI am here!‚Äù And looking round her, at her side she saw, A youthful mail√®d form‚Äîthe festal robe Flung backward, and the face, the mouth, the eyes Whereof the vision filled her night and day. Then straight, without a word, with one deep sigh, She held the wine-cup forth. He poured out first Libation to the goddess, and the rest Drained at a draught, and cast his arms round her, And down the long-drawn sounding colonnade Snatched her to where without, beneath the dawn, The brave steeds waited and the charioteer. His robe he round her threw; they saw the flare Of torches at the gate; they heard the shouts Of hot pursuit grow fainter; till at last, In solitude, across the rounding plain They flew through waking day, until they came To Media, and were wed. And soon her sire, Knowing their love, consented, and they lived Long happy lives; such is the might of Love. That is the tale the soldier from the East, Chares of Mytilen√©, ages gone, Told oftentimes at many a joyous feast In Hellas; and he said that all the folk In Media loved it, and their painters limned The story in the temples of their gods, And in the stately palaces of kings, Because they reverenced the might of Love. IN WILD WALES. I.‚ÄîAt the Eisteddfod. The close-ranked faces rise, With their watching, eager eyes, And the banners and the mottoes blaze above; And without, on either hand, The eternal mountains stand, And the salt sea river ebbs and flows again, And through the thin-drawn bridge the wandering winds complain. Here is the Congress met, The bardic senate set, And young hearts flutter at the voice of fate; All the fair August day Song echoes, harpers play, And on the unaccustomed ear the strange Penillion rise and fall through change and counter-change. Oh Mona, land of song! Oh mother of Wales! how long From thy dear shores an exile have I been! Still from thy lonely plains, Ascend the old sweet strains, And at the mine, or plough, or humble home, The dreaming peasant hears diviner music come. This innocent, peaceful strife, This struggle to fuller life, Is still the one delight of Cymric souls‚Äî Swell, blended rhythms! still The gay pavilions fill. Soar, oh young voices, resonant and fair; Still let the sheathed sword gleam above the bardic chair. The Menai ebbs and flows, And the song-tide wanes and goes, And the singers and the harp-players are dumb; The eternal mountains rise Like a cloud upon the skies, And my heart is full of joy for the songs that are still, The deep sea and the soaring hills, and the steadfast Omnipotent Will. II.‚ÄîAt the Meeting Field. Here is the complement of what I saw When late I sojourned in the halls of song, The greater stronger Force, the higher Law, Of those which carry Cymric souls along. No dim Cathedral's fretted aisles were there, No gay pavilion fair, with banners hung: The eloquent pleading voice, the deep hymns sung, The bright sun, and the clear unfettered air. These were the only ritual, this the fane, A poor fane doubtless and a feeble rite For those who find religion in dim light, Strange vestments, incensed air, and blazoned pane. But the rapt crowd, the reverent mute throng, When the vast listening semi-circle round, Rang to the old man's voice serenely strong, Or swept along in stormy bursts of sound. Where found we these in temples made with hands? Where, the low moan which marks the awakened soul? Where, this rude eloquence whose strong waves roll Deep waters, swift to bear their Lord's commands? Where found we these? 'neath what high fretted dome? I know not. I have knelt 'neath many, yet Have heard few words so rapt and burning come, Nor marked so many eyes divinely wet, As here I knew‚Äî‚ÄúWhat will you do, oh friends, When life ebbs fast and the dim light is low, When sunk in gloom the day of pleasure ends, And the night cometh, and your being runs slow, And nought is left you of your revelries, Your drunken nights, your wantonness, your ill‚Äî And lo! the last dawn rises cold and chill, And lo! the lightning of All-seeing eyes, What will you do?‚Äù And when the low voice ceased, And from the gathered thousands surged the hymn, Some strong power choked my voice, my eyes grew dim. I knew that old man eloquent, a priest. There is a consecration not of man, Nor given by laid-on hands nor acted rite, A priesthood fixed since the firm earth began, A dedication to the eye of Light, And this is of them. What the form of creed I care not, hardly the fair tongue I know, But this I know, that when the concourse freed From that strong influence, went sedate and slow, I thought when on the Galilean shore By the Great Priest the multitudes were led, The bread of life, miraculously more, Sufficed for all who came, and they were fed. SUFFRAGES. ‚ÄúSurely,‚Äù said a voice, ‚ÄúO Lord, Thy judgments Are dreadful and hard to understand. Thy laws which Thou madest, they withstand Thee, They stand against Thee and Thy command: Thy poor, they are with us evermore; They suffer terrible things and sore; They are starved, they are sick, they die, And there is none to help or heed; They come with a great and bitter cry, They hardly dare to whisper, as they plead; And there is none to hear them, God or man; And it is little indeed that all our pity can. What, and shall I be moved to tears, As I sit in this still chamber here alone, By the pity of it,‚Äîthe childish lives that groan, The miseries and the sorrows, the hopes and the fears Of this wonderful legend of life, that is one and the same Though it differ in weal and in happiness, honour and fame,‚Äî Shall I turn, who am no more than a worm, to Thee, From the pity of it‚Äîthe want, the misery, And with strong yearnings beat, and rebellions wild, Seeing death written, and pain, in the face of a child;‚Äî And yet art Thou unmoved! Ah, Lord, if Thou sawest surely!‚Äîand yet Thou dost see; And if Thou knewest indeed!‚Äîand yet all things are clear to Thee. For, Lord, of a truth Thy great ones, Who have not their wealth of their own desert, Live ever equal lives and sure, And are never vexed nor suffer hurt, But through long untroubled years endure Until they join Thee, and are in bliss; Or, maybe, are carried away from Thee, and miss Thy Face, which is too pure for them to see, And are thenceforth in misery: But, nevertheless, upon the earth They come to neither sorrow nor dearth. They are great, and they live out their lives, and Thou lettest them be; Thou dost not punish them here, if they despise Thy poor and pass them by with averted eyes. They are strong and mighty, and never in danger to fall; But Thou, Lord, art mighty and canst, and yet carest not at all. But wherefore is it that such things are;‚Äî That want and famine, and blood and war Are everywhere, and do prevail? And wherefore is it the same monotonous tale Is ever told by the lips of men? For there is hardly so hard a heart In the breast of a man who has taken his part In the world, and has little children around his knees, But is filled with great love for them as Thou art for these, And would give up all for their good, and is vexed day and night With fatherly doubts and fears and yearnings for right, And grows sick, if evil come nigh them body or soul, And yet is but a feeble thing, without strength or control. But Thou art almighty for good; yet Thy plagues, they come, Hunger and want and disease, in a terrible sum; And the poor fathers waste, and are stricken with slow decay; And the children fall sick, and are starving, day after day; And the hospital wards are choked; and the fire and the flood Vex men still, and the leaguered cities are red with blood. Ay, yet not the less, O Lord, I know Thou art just and art good indeed. This is it that doth perplex my thought, So that I rest not content in any creed. If I knew that Thou wert the Lord of Ill, Then were I untouched still, And, if I would, might worship at Thy shrine; Or if my mind might prove no Will Divine Inspired the dull mechanical reign of Law. But now, while Thou art surely, and art good, And wouldst Thy creatures have in happiness, Alway the sword, the plague prevail no less, Not less, not less Thy laws are based in blood. And such deep inequalities of lot Confuse our thought, as if Thy hand were not. All blessings, health and wealth and honours spent On some unworthy sordid instrument; Thy highest gift of genius flung away On some vile thing of meanest clay, Who fouls the ingrate lips, touched with Thy fire, With worse than common mire: How should I fail alone, when all things groan, To let my weak voice take a pleading tone! How should I speak a comfortable word When such things are, O Lord!‚Äù This is the cry that goes up for ever To Heaven from weak and striving souls: But the calm Voice makes answer to them never; The undelaying chariot onward rolls. But another voice: ‚ÄúO Lord of all, I bless Thee, I bless Thee and give thanks for all. Thou hast kept me from my childhood up, Thou hast not let me fall. All the fair days of my youth Thou wast beside, me and Thy truth. I bless Thee that Thou didst withhold The blight of fame, the curse of gold; Because Thou hast spared my soul as yet, Amid the wholesome toil of each swift day, The tumult and the fret Which carry worldly lives from Thee away. I thank Thee for the sorrows Thou hast sent, Being in all things content To see in every loss a greater gain, A joy in every pain; The losses I have known, since still I know Lives, hidden with Thee, are and grow. I do not know, I cannot tell, How it may be, yet death and pain are well: I know that Thou art good and mild, Though sickness take and break the helpless child; 'Twas Thou, none else, that gav'st the mother's love, And even her anguish came from Thee above. I am content to be that which Thou wilt: Tho' humble be my pathway and obscure, Yet from all stain of guilt Keep Thou me pure. Or if Thy evil still awhile must find Its seat within my mind, Be it as Thou wilt, I am not afraid. And for the world Thy hand has made, Thy beautiful world, so wondrous fair: Thy mysteries of dawn, Thy cloudless days; Thy mountains, soaring high through Thy pure air; Thy glittering sea, sounding perpetual praise; Thy starlit skies, whence worlds unnumbered gaze; Thy earth, which in Thy bounteous summer-tide Is clad in flowery robes and glorified; Thy still primeval forests, deeply stirred By Thy great winds as by an unknown word; Thy fair, light-wing√®d creatures, blithe and free; Thy dear brutes living, dying, silently: Shall I from them no voice to praise Thee find? Thy praise is hymned by every balmy wind That wanders o'er a wilderness of flowers; By every happy brute which asks not why, But rears its brood and is content to die. From Thee has come whatever good is ours;‚Äî The gift of love that doth exalt the race; The gift of childhood with its nameless grace; The gift of age which slow through ripe decay, Like some fair fading sunset dies away; The gift of homes happy with honest wealth, And fair lives flowering in unbroken health,‚Äî All these are Thine, and the good gifts of brain, Which to heights greater than the earth can gain, And can our little minds project to Thee, Through Infinite Space‚Äîacross Eternity. For these I praise Thy name; but above all The precious gifts Thy bounteous hand lets fall, I praise Thee for the power to love the Right, Though Wrong awhile show fairer to the sight; The power to sin, the dreadful power to choose The evil portion and the good refuse; And last, when all the power of ill is spent, The power to seek Thy face and to repent.‚Äù This is the answering cry that goes for ever To Heaven from blest untroubled souls: But the calm Voice makes answer to them never; The undelaying chariot onward rolls. LOOK OUT, O LOVE. Look out, O Love, across the sea: A soft breeze fans the summer night, The low waves murmur lovingly, And lo! the beacon's fitful light. Some day perchance, when I am gone, And muse by far-off tropic seas, You may be gazing here alone, On starlit waves and skies like these. Or perhaps together, you and I, Rapt each in each, no other by, Shall watch again that fitful flame, And know that we are not the same. Or maybe we shall come no more, But prisoned on some unknown shore, In dreams shall see that light again, And hear that starlit sea complain. CLYT√ÜMNESTRA IN PARIS. I seemed to pace the dreadful corridors Of a still foreign prison, blank and white, And in a bare and solitary cell To find a lonely woman, soft of voice And mild of eye, who never till life's end Should pass those frowning gates. Methought I asked her The story of her crime, and what hard fate Left her, so gentle seeming, fettered there, Hopeless, a murderess at whose very name Men shuddered still. And to my questioning Methought that dreadful soul made answer thus: ‚ÄúYes, I suppose I liked him, though I know not; I hardly know what love may be; how should I?‚Äî I a young girl wedded without my will, As is our custom here, to a man old, Not perhaps in years, but dark experiences. What had we two in common, that worn man, And I an untrained girl? It was not strange If when that shallow boy, with his bold tongue, And his gay eyes, and curls, and budding beard, Flattered me, I was weak. I think all women Are weak sometimes, and overprone to love When the man is young, and straight, and 'twas a triumph To see the disappointed envious jades Wince as he passed them carelessly, nor heeded Their shallow wiles to trap him,‚Äîay, a triumph! And that was all; I hardly know, indeed, If it was love that drove, or only pride To hold what others grudged me. Vain he was, And selfish, and a coward, as you shall hear. Handsome enough, I grant you, to betray A stronger soul than mine. Indeed, I think, He never cared for me nor I for him (For there were others after him): I knew it, Then chiefest, when our comedy of life Was turning at the last to tragedy. ‚ÄúNow that I was unfaithful, a false wife, I value not men's sneers at a pin's point, We have a right to love and to be loved; Not the mere careless tolerance of the spouse Who has none to give. True, if I were a nun, Vowed to a white and cloistered life, no doubt 'Twere otherwise. They tell me there are women Who are so rapt by thoughts of the poor, of churches, Of public ends, of charity, of schools, Of Heaven knows what, they live their lives untouched By passion; but for us, who are but women, Not bred on moonlight, made of common clay, Untrained for aught but common bourgeois life, Life is no mystical pale procession winding Its way from the cradle to the grave, but rather A thing of hot swift flushes, fierce delights, Good eating, dances, wines, and all the rest, When the occasion comes. I never loved him, I tell you; therefore, maybe, did no sin. ‚ÄúBut when this fellow must presume to boast, Grow cold, have scruples for his soul and mine, And turn to other younger lives, and pass My door to-day with this one, then with that, And all the gossips of the quarter sneered, And knew I was deserted, do you think it A wonder that my eyes, opened at last, Saw all the folly and the wickedness (If sweet it were, where were the wickedness?) Which bore such bitter fruit? Think you it strange That I should turn for aid, ay, and revenge, To my wronged spouse‚Äîif wronged he be, indeed, Who doth consent as he did? When I told him, Amid my tears, he made but small pretence Of jealousy at all; only his pride Was perhaps a little wounded. And indeed It took such long confessions, such grave pain Of soul, such agony of remorse of mine To move him but a little, that I grew So weary of it all, it almost checked My penitence, and left me free to choose Another for my love; but at the last, Long labour, feigned reports, the neighbours' sneers, These drove him at the last, good easy man, To such a depth of hatred, that my task Grew lighter, and my heart. He bade me write Loving appeals, recalling our past days Together; and I wrote them, using all The armoury of loving cozening words With which craft arms us women: but in vain, For whether some new love engrossed, or whether He wearied of me and my love, I know not, Only, in spite of all, no answer came. ‚ÄúAt length, since I could get no word from him, My husband bade me write‚Äîor was it I Who thought of the device? Pray you believe me, I would speak nothing else than the whole truth, But these sad dreadful deeds confuse the brain. Well, perhaps 'twas I, who knew his weakness well; I do not know, but somehow it came to pass I wrote a crafty letter, begging of him, By all our former kindness, former wrong, If for the last time, recognizing well That all was done between us evermore, We might, for one last evening, meet and part, And, knowing he was needy, and his greed,‚Äî ‚ÄòIf only he would come,‚Äô I wrote to him, ‚ÄòI had some secret savings, and desired‚Äî For what need comes there closer than a friend's?‚Äî To help him in his trouble.‚Äô Swift there came‚Äî The viper!‚Äîhypocritical words of love: Yes, he would come, for the old love still lived, He knew it, ah, too well; not all the glamour Of other eyes and lips could ever quench The fire of that mad passion. He would come, Loving as ever, longing for the day. ‚ÄúNow when we had the answer, straight we three‚Äî My husband and myself, and his weak brother, Whose daughter to her first communion went That very day,‚Äîand I, too, took the Host As earnest of changed life,‚Äîwe three, I say, At a little feast we made to celebrate The brothers reconciled (in families There come dissensions, as you know), devised His punishment. We hired, in a still suburb, A cottage standing backward from the street, Beyond an avenue of sycamores; A lonely place, unnoticed. Day by day We went, we three together‚Äîfor I feared Lest, if there were no third, the strength of youth Might bear my husband down‚Äîwe went to make All needful preparations. First we spread Over all the floor a colour like to blood, For deep's the stain of blood, and what shall cleanse it? Also, my husband, from a neighbouring wood, Had brought a boar-trap, sharp with cruel knives And jagg√®d teeth, to close with a snap and tear The wild beast caught within it. But I deemed The risk too great, the prey might slip away; Therefore, that he might meet his punishment, And to prevent the sound of cries and groans, My husband fashioned for his lips a gag, And on the mantel left it, and the means To strike a light. And being thus prepared, We three returned to Paris; there long time We sate eating and drinking of the best, As those do who have taken a resolve Whence no escape is, save to do and die. ‚ÄúThen the two men went back and left me there, With all my part to do. It was an hour Or more before the time when my poor dupe Had fixed to meet me. Wandering thus alone Through the old streets, seeing the common sights Of every day, the innocent child-faces Homing from school, so like my little ones, I seemed to lose all count of time. At length, Because it was the Ascension Feast, there came A waft of music from the open doors Of a near church, and, entering in, I found The incensed air, all I remembered well‚Äî The lights, the soaring chants, the kneeling crowds, When I believed and knelt. They seemed to soothe My half bewildered fancy, and I thought‚Äî What if a woman, who mayhap had sinned But lightly, wishing to repair her wrong, And bound thereby to some dark daring deed Of peril, should come here, and kneel awhile, And ask a blessing for the deed, of her Who is Heaven's Queen and knows our weaknesses, Being herself a woman! So I knelt In worship, and the soaring voices clear And the dim heights and suffrage-laden air Filled me with comfort for my soul, and nerved My failing heart, and winged time's lagging flight, Till lo the hour was come when I should go To meet him for the last time. ‚ÄúWhen we left The city far behind, the sweet May night Was falling on the quiet village street; There was a scent of hawthorn on the air As we passed on with feint of loving words,‚Äî Passed slow like lovers to the appointed place, Passed to the place of punishment and doom. ‚ÄúBut when we reached the larkling avenue Of sycamores, which to the silent house Led through a palpable gloom, I felt him shudder With some blind vague presentiment of ill, And he would go no further; but I clung Around him close, laughed all his fear to scorn, Whispered words in his ear, and step by step, My soul on reparation being bent, Drew him reluctant to the fated door Where lay my spouse in ambush, and swift death. ‚ÄúI think I hear the dreadful noise of the key, Turning within the disused lock, the hall Breathing a false desertion, the loud sound Of both our footsteps echoing through the house. I could not choose but tremble. Yet I knew 'Twas but a foolish weakness. Then I struck A match, and in the burst of sudden light I saw the ruddy cheek grown ashy pale, And as he doffed his hat, I marked the curls On his white forehead, and the boyish grace Which hung around him still, and almost felt Compassion. Then the darkness came again, And hid him, and I groped to find his hand, Clutched it with mine, and led him to the door. ‚ÄúBut when within the darkling room we were Where swift death waited him, not dalliance, Three times my trembling fingers failed to wake The twinkling light which scarce could pierce the gloom Which hid my husband. Oh, to see his face When the dark aspect and the furious eyes Glared out on him! ‚ÄòI am lost!‚Äô he cried, ‚ÄòI am lost!‚Äô And then the sound of swift and desperate fight And a death struggle. Listening, as I stood Without, with that mean craven hound, our brother, I heard low cries of rage, and knew despair And youth had nerved the unarmed in such sort As made the conflict doubtful. Then I rushed Between them, threw my arms around him, clogged His force and held him fast, crying the while, ‚ÄòWretch, would you kill my husband!‚Äô‚Äîheld him fast, As coils a serpent round the escaping deer, Until my husband, hissing forth his hate, ‚ÄòVillain, I pierce thy heart as thou hast mine,‚Äô Stabbed through and through his heart. ‚ÄúBut oh, but oh The lonely road, beneath the dreadful stars! To the swift stream, we three‚Äînay, nay, we four‚Äî One on the child's poor carriage covered o'er, And three who drew him onward, on the road, That dead thing, having neither eye nor ear, Which late was full of life, and strife, and hate. On that dumb silence, came no wayfarer, And once the covering which concealed our load Slipped down, and left the ghastly blood-stained thing Open to prying eyes, but none were there; And then the darkling river, and the sound When, with lead coiled around it, the dead corpse Sank with a sullen plunge within the deep, And took with it the tokens of our crime. ‚ÄúThen with a something of relief, as those Who have passed through some great peril all unharmed, We went and burned the blood-stained signs of death, And left the dreadful place, and once more sped To Paris and to sleep, till the new day, Now risen to high noon, touched our sad dreams. ‚ÄúAnd that day, since we could not work as yet, We to the Picture Gallery went, and there We took our fill of nude voluptuous limbs, Mingled with scenes of horror bathed in blood, Such as our painters love. So week by week, Careless and unafraid, we spent our days, Till when that sad night faded; swift there rose, Bursting the weights that kept it, the pale corpse, A damning witness from the deep, and brought The dreadful past again, and with it doom. ‚ÄúYou know how we were tried, and how things went, The cozening speeches, the brow-beating judge, The petty crafts which make the pleader's art, The dolts who sit in judgment, when the one Who knows all must be silent; but you know not The intolerable burden of suspense, The hard and hateful gaze of hungry eyes Which gloat upon your suffering. When doom came It was well to know the worst, and hear no more The half-forgotten horrors. But I think The sense of common peril, common wrong, Knits us in unity indissoluble, Closer than years of converse. When my husband, Braving his doom, embraced me as he went: ‚ÄòWife, so thou live I care not,‚Äô all my heart Went out to him for a moment, and I cried, ‚ÄòLet me die too, my guilt is more than his.‚Äô ‚ÄúSome quibble marred the sentence, and once more The miserable tale was told afresh: Once more I stood before those hungry eyes, And when 'twas done we went forth slaves for life, Both with an equal doom, and ever since We suffer the same pains in solitude, Slaves fettered fast, whom only death sets free. ‚ÄúThat is my tale told truly. Now you know, Sir, of what fashion I am made: a woman Gentle, you see, and mild eyed. If I sinned Surely there was temptation, and I sought Such reparation as I could. There are here Tigresses, and not women, black of brow And strong of arm, who have struck down or stabbed Husband, or child, or lover, not as I, But driven by rage and jealousy, and drink, These creatures of the devil, as I pass I see them shrink and shudder. The young priest Of the prison, a well-favoured lad he is, When I confessed to him bore on his brow Cold drops of agony; the Sister grew So pale at what I told her, that I thought She was like to swoon away, until I soothed her. Poor wretch, she has much to learn; and here I am, And shall be till my hair turns grey, my eyes Grow dim, and I have clean forgotten all That brought me here, and all my former life Fades like a once-heard tale. In the long nights, As I lie alone in my cell like any nun, I wake sometimes with a start, and seem to hear That rusty lock turn, and those echoing feet Down that dark passage, and I seem to see The dreadful stare of those despairing eyes, And then there sounds, a plunge in the deep, and I Lie shivering till the dawn. I have no comfort, Except the holy Mass; for see you, sir, I was devout until they scoffed at me. And now I know there is a hell indeed, Since this place is on earth. I do not think I have much cause to fear death, should it come; For whoso strives for Duty, all the Saints And the Madonna needs must love, and I, I have done what penitence could do; and here What have I of reward?‚Äîmy children taken As clean from me as if they were dead indeed, Trained to forget their mother. Sir, I see, Beyond these shallow phantasms of life; And this I hold, that one whose conscience shows As clear as mine must needs be justified. I love the holy Mass, and take the Host As often as I may, being of good heart. For what was it she did in Holy Writ, The Kenite's wife of old? I do not read That women shrunk from her because she drave The nail through her guest's brain; nay, rather, praise Was hers: yet was she not betrayed as I, Nor yet repentant of her wrong and seeking To do what good was left. But look you, sir, If I was once repentant, that is past: I hate those black-browed women, who turn from me, That smooth priest and that poor fool with her cross, And that strange pink-and-whiteness of the nun. And sometimes when they come I let them hear Such things as make the pious hypocrites turn And cross themselves. And for that tigress crew, If I might only steal to their cells at night With a knife, I would teach them, what it is to stab; Or even without one, that these little hands Can strangle with the best. Ah, you draw back, You too are shocked forsooth. Listen, you wretch, Who are walking free while I am prisoned here: How many thoughts of murder have you nursed Within your miserable heart! how many Low, foul desires which would degrade the brute! Do you think I do not know you men? What was it That kept your hands unstained, but accident?‚Äî Accident, did I say? or was it rather Cowardice, that you feared the stripes of the law, And did not dare to do your will or die?‚Äî Accident! then, I pray you, where the merit To have abstained? Or if you claim, indeed, Such precious self-restraint as keeps your feet From straying, where the credit? since it came A gift as much unearned as other's ill, Which lurked for them a little tiny speck Hidden in the convolutions of the brain, To grow with their growth, and wax with their years, and leave The wretch at last in Hell. Do you deem it just, The Potter with our clay upon His wheel Should shape it in such form? I love not God, Being such; I hate Him rather: I, His creature, I do impugn His justice or His power, I will not feign obedience‚ÄîI, a woman, Of a soft nature, who would love my love, And my child, and nothing more; who am, instead, A murderess, as they tell me, pining here In hell before my time.‚Äù Even as she spake I seemed to be again as when I saw The murderess of old time; and once again Within that modern prison, blank and white, There came the viewless trouble in the air Which took her, and the sweep of wings unseen, And terrible sounds which swooped on her and hushed Her voice and seemed to occupy her soul With horror and despair; and as I passed The crucifix within the corridor, ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù I cried, ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù PICTURES‚ÄîIII. The sad slow dawn of winter; frozen trees And trampled snow within a lonely wood; One shrouded form, which to the city flees; And one, a masquer, lying in his blood. A full sun blazing with unclouded day, Till the bright waters mingle with the sky; And on the dazzling verge, uplifted high; White sails mysterious slowly pass away. Hidden in a trackless and prim√¶val wood, Long-buried temples of an unknown race, And one colossal idol; on its face A changeless sneer, blighting the solitude. A fair girl half undraped, who blithely sings; Her white robe poised upon one budding breast; While at her side, invisible, unconfessed, Love folds her with the shelter of his wings. Black clouds embattled on a lurid sky, And one keen flash, like an awakened soul, Piercing the hidden depths, while momently One waits to hear enormous thunders roll. Two helpless girls upon a blazing wall, The keen flames leaping always high and higher; But faster, faster than the hungry fire, Brave hearts which climb to save them ere they fall. A youthful martyr, looking to the skies From rack and stake, from torment and disgrace; And suddenly heaven opened to his eyes, A beckoning hand, a tender heavenly face. A home on a fair English hill; away Stretch undulating plains, now gold now green, With park and lake and glade, and homestead grey; And crowning all, the blue sea dimly seen. A lifeless, voiceless, world of age-long snow, Where winter crawls on slow through endless night, And safe within a low hut's speck of light, Strong souls alert and hopeful, by the glow. A great ship forging slowly from the shore, And on the broad deck weeping figures bent; And on the gliding pierhead, sorrow-spent, Those whom the voyagers shall see no more. CONFESSION. Who is there but at times has seen, While his past days before him stand, In all the chances which have been, The guidance of a hidden Hand, Which still has ruled his growing life, Through weal and woe, through joy and pain, Through fancied good, through useless strife, And empty pleasure sought in vain; Which often has withheld the meed He longed for once, with yearnings blind, And given the truest prize indeed, The harvest of a blessed mind And so accepts the common lot Content, whate'er the Ruler would, Since all that has been, or has not, Springs from a hidden root of good? Yet some there are maybe to-day, Whose childhood at the mother's knee Was taught to bow itself and pray, Nor ever thirsted to be free, Who now, 'mid warring voices loud, Have lost the faith they held before, Nor through the jangling of the crowd Can hear the earlier message more. A brute Fate vexes them, the reign Of dumb laws, speeding onward still, Regardless of the waste and pain, Which all the labouring earth do fill. They look to see the rule of Right; They find it not, and in its stead But slow survivals, born of Might, And all the early Godhead dead; They see it not, and droop and faint And are unhappy, doubting God; Yet every step their feet have trod Was trodden before them by a saint. Oh, doubting soul, look up, behold The eternal heavens above thy head, The solid earth beneath, its mould Compacted of the unnumbered dead. Here the eternal problems grow, And with each day are solved and done, When some spent life, like melting snow, Breathes forth its essence to the sun. As death is, life is‚Äîwithout end; Wrong with right mingles, joy with pain; Forbid two meeting streams to blend, 'Twere not more hopeless, nor more vain. Though Death with Life, though Wrong with Right, Are bound within the scheme of things, Yet can our souls, on soaring wings, Gain to a loftier purer height, Where death is not, nor any life, Nor right nor wrong, nor joy nor pain; But changeless Being, lacking strife, Doth through all change, unchanged remain. Should Wrong prevail o'er all the earth, 'Twere nought if only we discern The one great truth, which if we learn, All else beside is little worth. That Right, is that which must prevail, If not here, there, if not now, then, Is the one Truth which shall not fail, For all the doubts and fears of men. What if a myriad ages still Of wrong and pain, of waste and blood, Confuse our thought, triumphant Good At length, at last, our souls can fill With such assurance as the Voice Which from the fiery mountain pealed, And bade the kneeling hosts rejoice That God was in His laws revealed. Nay even might our thought conceive The final victory of Ill, Not so, were it folly to believe That Right is higher, purer still. Who knows the Eternal ‚ÄúOught‚Äù knows well That whoso loves and seeks the Right, For him God shines with changeless light, Ay, to the lowest deeps of Hell. And whoso knoweth God indeed, The fixed foundations of his creed Know neither changing nor decay, Though all creation pass away. LOVE UNCHANGED. My love, my love, if I were old, My body bent, my blood grown cold, With thin white hairs upon my brow. Say wouldst thou think of me as now? Wouldst thou cling to me still, As down life's sloping hill We came at last through the unresting years? Art thou prepared for tears, For time's sure-coming losses, For life's despites and crosses, My love, my love? Ah! brief our little, little day; Ah! years that fleet so fast away; Before our summer scarce begun, Look, spring and blossom-tide are done! When all things hasten past, How should love only last? How should our souls alone unchanged remain?‚Äî Come pleasure or come pain. In days of joy and gladness, In years of grief and sadness, Love shall be love! AT THE END. When the five gateways of the soul Are closing one by one, When our being's currents slowly roll And day is done, What shall our chiefest comfort be Amid this misery? Not to have stores heaped up on high Of gold and precious things, Not to have flown from sky to sky On Fame's wide wings,‚Äî These things a little space do last, And then are overpast. Nor to have worked with patient brain In senate or in mart, To have gained the meed which those attain Who have played their part,‚Äî Effort is fair, success is sweet, But leave life incomplete. Nor to have said, as the fool says, ‚ÄúBe merry, soul, rejoice; ‚ÄúThou hast laid up store for many days.‚Äù Oh, foolish voice! Already at thy gate the feet Of the corpse-bearers meet. Nor to have heaped up precious store Of all the gains of time, Of long-dead sages' treasured lore, Or deathless rhyme,‚Äî Though Learning be a comely maid, Death maketh her afraid. Nor to have drained the cup of youth, To the sweet maddening lees; Nor, rapt by dreams of Hidden Truth, To have spurned all these;‚Äî Pleasure, Denial, touch not him Whose body and mind are dim. Not one of all these things shall I For comfort use, or strength, When the sure hour, when I must die, Takes me at length; One thought alone shall bring redress For that great heaviness:‚Äî That I have held each struggling soul As of one kin and blood, That one sure link doth all control To one close brotherhood; For who the race of men doth love, Loves also Him above. THREE BRETON POEMS. I. THE ORPHAN GIRL OF LANNION. In seventeen hundred and eighty-three, To Lannion came dole and misery. Mignon an orphan, as good as fair, Served in the little hostelry there. One darkling night, when the hour was late, Two travellers rang at the outer gate. ‚ÄúQuick, hostess! supper, red wine, and food; We have money to pay, so that all be good.‚Äù When they had drunken enough, and more, ‚ÄúHere is white money to pay the score. ‚ÄúAnd now shall your little serving-maid come, With her lantern lighted, to guide us home.‚Äù ‚ÄúGentles, in all our wide Brittany There is no man would harm her, so let it be.‚Äù Forth went the maid, full of innocent pride, Fearless and free, with her light by her side. When they were far on their lonely way, They began to whisper, and mutter, and say, ‚ÄúLittle maid, your face is as fair and bright As the foam on the wave in the morning light.‚Äù ‚ÄúGentles, I pray you, flatter me not: It is as God made it‚Äîno other, God wot; ‚ÄúAnd were it fairer, I tell you true‚Äî Ay, a hundred times fairer‚Äî'twere nought to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo judge, little maid, by your sober speech, You know all the good priests at the school can teach; ‚ÄúTo judge from your accents, discreet and mild, You were bred in the convent cloister, my child.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo teacher had I, neither priest nor nun; There was no one to teach me on earth, not one. ‚ÄúBut while by my father's poor hearth I wrought, God filled me with many a holy thought.‚Äù ‚ÄúSet down your lantern and put out the light. Here is gold: none can help you, 'tis dead of night.‚Äô ‚ÄúGood sirs! for my brother the young priest's sake; If he heard such sayings his heart would break.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, plunge me down fathoms deep in the sea, Of your mercy, rather than this thing be! ‚ÄúRather than this‚Äî'twere a lighter doom‚Äî Oh bury me quick in a living tomb!‚Äù The motherly hostess, sore afraid, Waited in vain for her little maid. She watched by the chill hearth's flickering light Till the bell tolled twice through the black dead night. Then cried, ‚ÄúUp, serving-men, sleep no more! Help!‚Äîlittle maid Mignon lies drowned in gore.‚Äù By the cross she lay dead, in the dead cold night, But beside her her lantern was still alight! II. THE FOSTER BROTHER. Of all the noble damsels, in all our Brittany, Gwennola was the sweetest far, a maiden fair to see. Scarce eighteen summers shed their gold upon her shapely head, Yet all who loved the fair girl best were numbered with the dead‚Äî Her father and her mother, and eke her sisters dear. Ah! Mary, pity 'twas to see her shed the bitter tear At her casement in the castle, where a step-dame now bare sway, Her dim eyes fixed upon the sea, which glimmered far away. For three long years she watched in vain, in dole and misery, To see her foster brother's sail rise up from under sea; For three long years she watched in vain, hoping each day would send The only heart which beat to hers, her lover and her friend. ‚ÄúGo, get you gone and tend the kine,‚Äù the cruel step-dame said; ‚ÄúLeave brooding over long-past years: go, earn your daily bread.‚Äù She woke her, ere the darkling dawns, while yet 'twas dead of night, To sweep the floors and cleanse the house, and set the fires alight; To fetch the water from the brook, again and yet again, With heavy toil and panting breath, and young form bent in twain. One darkling winter morning, before the dawning light, With ringing hoofs, across the brook there rode a noble knight: ‚ÄúGood morrow, gracious maiden, and art thou free to wed?‚Äù And she, so young she was and meek, ‚ÄúI know not, sir,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI prithee tell me, maiden, if thou art fancy-free?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo none, sir, have I plighted yet my maiden troth,‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúThen take, fair maid, this ring of gold, and to your step-dame say, That to-day your troth is plighted to a knight from far away; ‚ÄúThat at Nantes a battle fierce was fought, wherein his squire was slain, And he himself lies stricken sore upon his bed of pain; ‚ÄúBut when three weeks are overpast, whatever fate betide, He will come himself full gaily, and claim thee for his bride.‚Äù Affrighted ran she to her home, when, lo, a wondrous thing! For on her slender finger blazed her foster brother's ring. II. The weeks crept onward slowly, crept slowly‚Äîone, two, three; But never came the young knight, no never more came he. ‚ÄúCome, it is time that you were wed, for I have sought for you A bridegroom fitted to your rank, an honest man and true.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, nay, I prithee, step-dame, there is none that I can wed, Only my foster brother dear I love, alive or dead. ‚ÄúWith this ring his troth he plighted, and whatever fate betide, He will come himself full gaily, and claim me for his bride.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeace, with thy golden wedding-ring! peace, fool, or I will teach With blows thy senseless chattering tongue to hold discreeter speech; ‚ÄúTo-morrow thou shalt be the bride, whether thou wilt or not, Of Giles the neat-herd, honest man: ay, this shall be thy lot.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf Giles the neat-herd, saidst thou? oh, I shall die of pain! Oh mother, dear dead mother, that thou wert in life again!‚Äù ‚ÄúGo, cry and wail without the house; go, feed on misery: Go, take thy fill of moans and tears, for wedded thou shalt be.‚Äù III. Just then the ancient sexton, with the bell that tolls the dead, Went up and down the country side, and these the words he said:‚Äî ‚ÄúPray for the soul of one who was a brave and loyal knight, Who bare at Nantes a grievous hurt, what time they fought the fight: ‚ÄúTo-morrow eve, at set of sun, amid the gathering gloom, From the white church they bear him forth, to rest within the tomb.‚Äù IV. ‚ÄúThou art early from the wedding feast!‚Äù ‚ÄúGood truth, I could not stay; I dared not see the piteous sight, and therefore turned away; ‚ÄúI could not bear the pity and the horror in her eyne, As she stood so fair, in blank despair, within the sacred shrine. ‚ÄúAround the hapless maiden, all were weeping bitterly, And the good old rector at the church, a heavy heart had he; ‚ÄúNot a dry eye was around her, save the step-dame stern alone, Who looked on with an evil smile, as from a heart of stone; ‚ÄúAnd when the ringers rang a peal, as now they came again, And the women whispered comfort, yet her heart seemed rent in twain. ‚ÄúHigh in the place of honour at the marriage feast she sate, Yet no drop of water drank she, and no crumb of bread she ate; ‚ÄúAnd when at last, the feast being done, they would light the bride to bed, The ring from off her hand she flung, the wreath from off her head, ‚ÄúAnd with wild eyes that spoke despair, and locks that streamed behind, Into the darkling night she fled, as swiftly as the wind.‚Äù V. The lights within the castle were out, and all asleep; Only, with fever in her brain, the maid would watch and weep. The chamber door swung open. ‚ÄúWho goes there?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not fear, Gwen; 'tis I, your foster brother.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh! at last, my love, my dear!‚Äù He raised her to the saddle, and his strong arm clasped her round, As, through the night, his charger white flew on without a sound. ‚ÄúHow fast we go, my brother!‚Äù ‚Äú'Tis a hundred leagues and more.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow happy am I, happier than in all my life before! ‚ÄúAnd have we far to go, brother? I would that we were come.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave patience, sister; hold me fast; 'tis a long way to our home.‚Äù The white owl shrieked around them, the wild things shrank in fear As through the night a cloud of light that ghostly steed drew near. ‚ÄúHow swift your charger is, brother! and your armour oh, how bright! Ah, no more you are a boy, brother, but in troth a noble knight! ‚ÄúHow beautiful you are, brother! but I would that we were come.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave patience, sister; hold me fast; we are not far from home.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour breath is icy-cold, brother, your locks are dank and wet; Your heart, your hands are icy-cold; oh! is it further yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave patience, sister; hold me fast; for we are nearly there; Hist! hear you not our marriage bells ring through the midnight air?‚Äù Even with the word, that ghostly steed neighed suddenly and shrill, Then trembled once through every limb, and like a stone stood still. And lo, within a land they were, a land of mirth and pleasure, Where youths and maidens hand in hand danced to a joyous measure; A verdant orchard closed them round with golden fruit bedight, And above them, from the heaven-kissed hills, came shafts of golden light; Hard by, a cool spring bubbled clear, a fountain without stain, Whereof the dead lips tasting, grew warm with life again. There was Gwennola's mother mild, and eke her sisters dear: Oh, land of joy and bliss and love!‚Äîoh, land without a tear! VI. But when the next sun on the earth, brake from the gathered gloom, From the white church, the young maids bore, the virgin to her tomb. III. AZENOR. ‚ÄúSeamen, seamen, tell me true, Is there any of your crew Who in Armor town has seen Azenor the kneeling queen?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have seen her oft indeed, Kneeling in the self-same place; Brave her heart, though pale her face, White her soul, though dark her weed.‚Äù I. Of a long-past summer's day Envoys came from far away, Mailed in silver, clothed with gold, High on snorting chargers bold. When the warder spied them near, To the King he went, and cried, ‚ÄúTwelve bold knights come pricking here: Shall I open to them wide?‚Äù ‚ÄúOpened let the great gates be; See the knights are welcomed all; Spread the board and deck the hall, We will feast them royally.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy our Prince's high command, Who one day shall be our King, We come to ask a precious thing‚Äî Azenor your daughter's hand.‚Äù ‚ÄúGladly will we grant your prayer: Brave the youth, as we have heard. Tall is she, milkwhite and fair, Gentle as a singing bird.‚Äù Fourteen days high feast they made, Fourteen days of dance and song; Till the dawn the harpers played; Mirth and joyance all day long. ‚ÄúNow, my fair spouse, it is meet That we turn us toward our home.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs you will, my love, my sweet; Where you are, there I would come.‚Äù II. When his step-dame saw the bride, Well-nigh choked with spleen was she: ‚ÄúThis pale-faced girl, this lump of pride‚Äî And shall she be preferred to me? ‚ÄúNew things please men best, 'tis true, And the old are cast aside. Natheless, what is old and tried Serves far better than the new.‚Äù Scarce eight months had passed away When she to the Prince would come, And with subtlety would say, ‚ÄúWould you lose both wife and home? ‚ÄúHave a care, lest what I tell Should befall you; it were best To have a care and guard you well, 'Ware the cuckoo in your nest.‚Äù ‚ÄúMadam, if the truth you tell, Meet reward her crime shall earn, First the round tower's straitest cell, Then in nine days she shall burn.‚Äù III. When the old King was aware, Bitter tears the greybeard shed. Tore in grief his white, white hair, Crying, ‚ÄúWould God that I were dead.‚Äù And to all the seamen said, ‚ÄúGood seamen, pray you tell me true, Is there, then, any one of you Can tell me if my child be dead?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy liege, as yet alive is she, Though burned to-morrow shall she be: But from her prison tower, O King! Morning and eve we hear her sing. ‚ÄúMorning and eve, from her fair throat Issues the same sweet plaintive note, ‚ÄòThey are deceived; I kiss Thy rod: Have pity on them, O my God!‚Äô‚Äù IV. Even as a lamb who gives its life All meekly to the cruel knife, White-robed she went, her soft feet bare, Self-shrouded in her golden hair. And as she to her dreadful fate Fared on, poor innocent, meek and mild, ‚ÄúGrave crime it were,‚Äù cried small and great, ‚ÄúTo slay the mother and the child.‚Äù All wept sore, both small and great; Only the step-dame smiling sate: ‚ÄúSure 'twere no evil deed, but good, To kill the viper with her brood.‚Äù ‚ÄúQuick, good firemen, fan the fire Till it leap forth fierce and red; Fan it fierce as my desire: She shall burn till she is dead.‚Äù Vain their efforts, all in vain, Though they fanned and fanned again; The more they blew, the embers gray Faded and sank and died away. When the judge the portent saw, Dazed and sick with fear was he: ‚ÄúShe is a witch, she flouts the law; Come, let us drown her in the sea.‚Äù V. What saw you on the sea? A boat Neither by sail nor oarsman sped; And at the helm, to watch it float, An angel white with wings outspread A little boat, far out to sea, And with her child a fair ladye, Whom at her breast she sheltered well, Like a white dove upon a shell. She kissed, and clasped, and kissed again His little back, his little feet, Crooning a soft and tender strain, ‚ÄúDa-da, my dear; da-da, my sweet. ‚ÄúAh, could your father see you, sweet, A proud man should he be to-day; But we on earth may never meet, But he is lost and far away.‚Äù VI. In Armor town is such affright As never castle knew before, For at the midmost hour of night The wicked step-dame is no more. ‚ÄúI see hell open at my side: Oh, save me, in God's name, my son! Your spouse was chaste; 'twas I who lied; Oh, save me, for I am undone!‚Äù Scarce had she checked her lying tongue, A viper from her lips would glide, With threatening fangs, which hissed and stung, And pierced her marrow till she died. Eftsoons, to foreign realms the knight Went forth, by land and over sea; Seeking in vain his lost delight, O'er all the round, round world went he. He sought her East, he sought her West, Next to the hot South sped he forth, Then, after many a fruitless quest, He sought her in the gusty North. There by some nameless island vast, His anchor o'er the side he cast; When by a brooklet's fairy spray, He spies a little lad at play. Fair are his locks, and blue his eyes, As his lost love's or as the sea; The good knight looking on them, sighs, ‚ÄúFair child, who may thy father be?‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, I have none save Him in heaven: Long years ago he went away, Ere I was born, and I am seven; My mother mourns him night and day.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is thy mother, child, and where?‚Äù ‚ÄúShe cleanses linen white and fair, In yon clear stream.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome, child, and we Together will thy mother see.‚Äù He took the youngling by the hand, And, as they passed the yellow strand, The child's swift blood in pulse and arm Leapt to his father's and grew warm. ‚ÄúRise up and look, oh mother dear; It is my father who is here: My father who was lost is come‚Äî Oh, bless God for it!‚Äîto his home.‚Äù They knelt and blessed His holy name, Who is so good, and just, and mild, Who joins the sire and wife and child: And so to Brittany they came. And may the blessed Trinity, Protect all toilers on the sea! GYCIA. DRAMATIS PERSON√Ü.Speaker's names have been abbreviated in this text.

What ails the King, that thus his brow is bent By such a load of care? King. Lysimachus, The load of empire lies a weary weight, On age-worn brains; tho' skies and seas may smile, And steadfast favouring Fortune sit serene, Guiding the helm of State, but well thou knowest‚Äî None better in my realm‚Äîthrough what wild waves, Quicksands, and rock-fanged straits, our Bosphorus, Laden with all our love, reels madly on To shipwreck and to ruin. From the North, Storm-cloud on storm-cloud issuing volleys forth Fresh thunderbolts of war. The Emperor Dallies within his closed seraglios, Letting his eunuchs waste the might of Rome, While the fierce Scythian, in a surge of blood, Bursts on our bare-swept plains. Upon the South, Our rival Cherson, with a jealous eye, Waits on our adverse chances, taking joy Of her republican guile in every check And buffet envious Fortune deals our State, Which doth obey a King. Of all our foes I hate and dread these chiefly, for I fear Lest, when my crown falls from my palsied brow, My son Asander's youth may prove too weak To curb these crafty burghers. Speak, I pray thee, Most trusty servant. Can thy loyal brain Devise some scheme whereby our dear loved realm May break the mesh of Fate? Lys. Indeed, my liege, Too well I know our need, and long have tossed Through sleepless nights, if haply I might find Some remedy, but that which I have found Shows worse than the disease. King. Nay, speak; what is it? I know how wise thy thought. Lys. My liege, it chances The Archon Lamachus is old and spent. He has an only child, a daughter, Gycia. The treasure of his age, who now blooms forth In early maidenhood. The girl is fair As is a morn in springtide; and her father A king in all but name, such reverence His citizens accord him. Were it not well The Prince Asander should contract himself In marriage to this girl, and take the strength Of Cherson for her dowry, and the power Of their strong fleets and practised arms to thrust The invading savage backward? King. Nay, my lord; No more of this, I pray. There is no tribe Of all the blighting locust-swarms of war, Which sweep our wasted fields, I would not rather Take to my heart and cherish than these vipers. Dost thou forget, my lord, how of old time, In the brave days of good Sauromatus, These venomous townsmen, shamelessly allied With the barbarian hosts, brought us to ruin; Or, with the failing force of C√¶sar leagued, By subtle devilish enginery of war, Robbed Bosphorus of its own, when, but for them, Byzantium were our prey, and all its might, And we Rome's masters? Nay; I swear to thee, I would rather see the Prince dead at my feet, I would rather see our loved State sunk and lost, Than know my boy, the sole heir of my crown, The sole hope of my people, taken and noosed By this proud upstart girl. Speak not of it; Ruin were better far. Lys. My liege, I bear No greater favour to these insolent townsmen Than thou thyself. I, who have fought with them From my first youth‚Äîwho saw my father slain, Not in fair fight, pierced through by honest steel, But unawares, struck by some villanous engine, Which, armed with inextinguishable fire, Flew hissing from the walls and slew at once Coward and brave alike; I, whose young brother, The stripling who to me was as a son, Taken in some sally, languished till he died, Chained in their dungeons' depths;‚Äîmust I not hate them With hate as deep as hell? And yet I know There is no other way than that Asander Should wed this woman. This alone can staunch The bleeding wounds of the State. King. Lysimachus, I am old; my will is weak, my body bent, Not more than is my mind; I cannot reason. But hark! I hear the ring of coursers' feet Bespeak Asander coming. What an air Of youth and morning breathes round him, and brings A light of hope again! Enter Asander from the chase. Asan. My dearest sire and King, art thou thus grave Of choice, or does our good Lysimachus, Bringing unwonted loads of carking care, O'ercloud thy brow? I prithee, father, fret not; There is no cloud of care I yet have known‚Äî And I am now a man, and have my cares‚Äî Which the fresh breath of morn, the hungry chase, The echoing horn, the jocund choir of tongues, Or joy of some bold enterprise of war, When the swift squadrons smite the echoing plains, Scattering the stubborn spearmen, may not break, As does the sun the mists. Nay, look not grave; My youth is strong enough for any burden Fortune can cast on me. King. Couldst thou, Asander, Consent to serve the State, if it should bid thee Wed without love? Asan. What, father, is that all? I do not know this tertian fever, love, Of which too oft my comrades groan and sigh, This green-sick blight, which turns a lusty soldier To a hysterical girl. Wed without love? One day I needs must wed, though love I shall not. And if it were indeed to serve the State, Nay, if 'twould smooth one wrinkle from thy brow, Why, it might be to-morrow. Tell me, father, Who is this paragon that thou designest Shall call me husband? Some barbarian damsel Reared on mare's milk, and nurtured in a tent In Scythia? Well, 'twere better than to mate With some great lady from the Imperial Court, Part tigress and all wanton. I care not; Or if the scheme miscarry, I care not. Tell me, good father. King. Wouldst thou wed, Asander, If 'twere to save the State, a Greek from Cherson? Asan. From Cherson? Nay, my liege; that were too much. A girl from out that cockatrice's den‚Äî Take such a one to wife? I would liefer take A viper to my breast! Nay, nay, you jest, My father, for you hate this low-born crew, Grown gross by huckstering ways and sordid craft‚Äî Ay, more than I. King. It is no jest, my son. Our good Lysimachus will tell thee all Our need and whence it comes. Lys. My gracious Prince, Thus stands the case, no otherwise Our foes Press closer year by year, our wide-spread plains Are ravaged, and our bare, unpeopled fields Breed scantier levies; while the treasury Stands empty, and we have not means to buy The force that might resist them. Nought but ruin, Speedy, inevitable, can await Our failing Bosphorus' unaided strength, Unless some potent rich ally should join Our weakness to her might. None other is there To which to look but Cherson; and I know, From trusty friends among them, that even now, Perchance this very day, an embassy Comes to us with design that we should sink Our old traditional hate in the new bonds Which Hymen binds together. For the girl Gycia, the daughter of old Lamachus, Their foremost man, there comes but one report‚Äî That she is fair as good. Asan. My lord, I pray you, Waste not good breath. If I must sell myself, It matters not if she be fair or foul, Angel or doubly damned; hating the race, Men, maidens, young and old, I would blight my life To save my country. King. Thanks, my dearest son. There spake a patriot indeed. Servant. My liege, An embassy from Cherson for the King. Enter Ambassador, with retinue. Ambas. Sirs, I bring you a message from Lamachus, the Archon of Cherson. Lys. Sirs, forsooth! know ye not the dignity of princes, or does your republican rudeness bar you from all courtesy? I do not count myself equal to the King, nor, therefore should you. King. Nay, good Lysimachus, let him proceed. Ambas. If I am blunt of speech, I beg your forgiveness. I bring to you a letter from the citizen Lamachus, which I shall read, if it be your pleasure. King. Read on. Ambas. ‚ÄúTo the King of Bosphorus, Lamachus sends greeting. We are both old. Let us forget the former enmities of our States, and make an alliance which shall protect us against the storm of barbarian invasion which C√¶sar is too weak to ward off. Thou hast a son, and I a daughter. Thy son is, from all report, a brave youth and worthy. My daughter is the paragon of her sex. I have wealth and possessions and respect as great as if I were a sceptred King. The youth and the maid are of fitting age. Let us join their hands together, and with them those of our States, and grow strong enough to defy the barbarians, and Rome also.‚Äù Asan. My liege, I am willing for this marriage. Let it be. King. My son, we have not yet heard all. Read on, sir. Ambas. ‚ÄúThere is one condition which not my will, but the jealousy of our people enforces, viz. that the Prince Asander, if he weds my daughter, shall thenceforth forswear his country, nor seek to return to it on pain of death. I pray thee, pardon the rudeness of my countrymen; but they are Greeks, and judge their freedom more than their lives.‚Äù Asan. Insolent hounds! This is too much. I will have none of them. Take back that message. King. Thou art right, my son. I could not bear to lose thee, not to win A thousand Chersons. Let us fight alone, And see what fortune sends us. Lys. Good my liege, Be not too hasty. (To Ambassador) Sir, the King has heard The message which you bring, and presently Will send a fitting answer. [Exit Ambassador. Nay, my liege, I beg your patience. That these fellows make Their friendship difficult is true; but think How great the value of it, and remember How easy 'tis to promise and break faith With insolent dogs like these. This Lamachus Is older than your grace, and feebler far. He will not live for ever, and, he gone, Will not the Prince Asander be as great, The husband of his daughter and his heir, As he is now, and sway the power of Cherson For our own ends, and cast to all the winds This foul enforc√®d compact, and o'er-turn This commonwealth of curs? I will stake my life That three years shall not pass ere he is King Of Cherson in possession, and at once Of Bosphorus next heir. ‚ÄúThe tongue hath sworn, the mind remains unsworn,‚Äù So says their poet. Asan. I'll have none of it. I am not all Greek, but part Cimmerian, And scorn to break my word. Let us face ruin, father, not deceit. King. My noble son, I love thee. Lys. Good, my liege, And thou, my Lord Asander, ponder it. Consider our poor country's gaping wounds, And what a remedy lies to our hands. I will die willingly if I devise not A scheme to bend these upstarts to your will. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE II.‚ÄîOutside the Palace. Megacles and Courtiers. Meg. Well, my lords, and so it is all settled. We must all be on board in half an hour. His Altitude the Prince sails at once for Cherson, and with a view to his immediate marriage. Was ever such a rash step heard of? Not twenty-four hours to get ready the marriage equipment of a Prince of Bosphorus. Well, well, I dare say they would be glad enough to take him with no rag to his back. I dare say these rascally republicans would know no better if he were to be married in his everyday suit. 1st Court. I' faith, I should never have dreamt it. Asander, who is the boldest huntsman and the bravest soldier, and the best of good fellows, to go and tie himself to the apronstring of a Greek girl, a tradesman's daughter from Cherson, of all places on earth! Pah! it makes me sick! 2nd Court. But I hear she is beautiful as Artemis, and‚Äî Well, we are all young or have been, and beauty is a strong loadstone to such metal as the Prince's. 3rd Court. Nay, he has never set eyes on her; and, for that matter, the Lady Irene was handsome enough, in all conscience, and a jovial young gentlewoman to boot. Ye gods! do you mind how she sighed for him and pursued him? It was a sight to please the goddess Aphrodite herself. But then, our good Asander, who had only to lift up his little finger, was so cold and positively forbidding, that I once came upon the poor lady crying her eyes out in a passion of mortified feeling. 1st Court. Ay, she was from this outlandish Cherson, was not she? Aphrodite was a Greek woman also, remember. 2nd Court. So she was. I had quite forgotten where the lady came from. Well, if she is there now, and cannot get her Prince, and would like a gay, tolerably well-favoured young fellow for a lover, I suppose she need go no further than the present company. Meg. My lords, I pray you leave these frivolities, and let us come to serious matters. Think, I beg you, in what a painful position I am placed. I am to go, without proper notice, as Master of the Ceremonies of the Court of Bosphorus, to conduct an important Court-ceremonial with a pack of scurvy knaves, who, I will be bound, hardly know the difference between an Illustrious and a Respectable, or a Respectable and an Honourable. I must do my best to arrange all decently and in order, and as near as may be to the Imperial model, and all these matters I have to devise on shipboard, tossed about on that villanous Euxine, with a smell of pitch everywhere, and seasickness in my stomach. And when I get to Cherson, if ever I do get there alive, I have not the faintest idea whom I am to consult with‚Äîwhether there is a Count of the Palace or anybody, in fact. I dare say there is nobody; I am sure there is nobody. A marriage of the heir apparent is a very serious affair, let me tell you. What a comfort it is that I have got the last edition of that precious work of the divine Theodosius on Dignities! If it were not for that, I should go mad. 1st Court. My good Megacles, I warn you the Prince cares as little for etiquette as he does for love-making. Meg. Very likely, and that makes my position so difficult. Just reflect for a moment. When we go ashore at Cherson, I suppose we shall be received by the authorities? 2nd Court. Surely, good Megacles. Meg. Then, how many steps should Prince Asander take to meet his father-in-law Lamachus‚Äîeh? And how many steps should Lamachus take? You never gave the matter a thought? Of course not. And these are questions to be settled on the spot, and scores like them. 3rd Court. I dare say it won't matter at all, or very little. Meg. Matter very little, indeed! very little, forsooth! Why, in the name of all the saints, do not alliances fall through for less? Are not bloody wars fought for less? Do I not remember the sad plight of the Grand Chamberlain, when the Illustrious Leo, the Pro-Consul of Macedonia, had a meeting at Court with the Respectable the Vice-Prefect of Pannonia? Now, the Pro-Consul should have taken four steps forward, as being the most noble, the Vice-Prefect five. But, the Vice-Prefect being a tall man, and the Pro Consul a short one, the Grand Chamberlain did not sufficiently measure their distances; and so when they had taken but four steps each, there were the two Dignitaries bolt upright, face to face, glaring at each other, and no room to take the fraction of a foot pace more. 1st Court. Faith, a very laughable situation, good Megacles. Was it hard to settle! Meg. I should think it was hard to settle. No one could interfere; the Book of Ceremonies was sent for, and was silent. There was nothing for it but that the Emperor, after half an hour, broke up the Court in confusion, and those two remained where they were till it was quite dark, and then they got away, no one knows how. But what came of it? For fifteen years there was war and bloodshed between the provinces, and but for the invasion of the Goths, there would be to this day. Matter little, indeed! Why, you foolish youngster, ceremony is everything in life. To understand Precedence aright is to know the secrets of nature. The order of Precedence is the order of Creation. It is, in fact, a very cosmogony. Oh, a noble science! a noble science! 1st Court. Right, good Megacles, to magnify your office. Bravery is nothing; goodness is nothing; beauty is a foolish dream. Give us Ceremony, Ceremony, more Ceremony; it is the salt of life. Meg. A very intelligent youth. But here comes the King. Enter the King, Asander, and Lysimachus. Asan. My liege, I do your will, Though with a heavy heart. Farewell, my father. If I must bid farewell to this dear City, Which nourished me from childhood, 'tis to save it, Not otherwise, and thou my sire and King. From thee I do not part, and often-times, If the saints will, I yet shall welcome thee, When all our foes are routed and our troubles Fled like some passing storm-cloud, to my hearth, And set thy heir upon thy knees, a Prince Of Bosphorus and Cherson. King. Good, my son, I pray God keep you, for I dimly fear, So dark a presage doth obscure my mind, That we shall meet no more. Lys. My honoured liege, These are the figments of a mind which grief Hath part disordered. Thou shalt see thy son, Trust me for it; I swear it. One thing more Remains. I know what 'tis to be a youth As yet untouched by love; I know what charm Lies in the magic of a woman's eyes For a young virgin heart. I pray you, sir, Swear to me by the saints, that, come what may, For no allurement which thy new life brings thee, The love of wife or child, wilt thou forget Our Bosphorus, but still wilt hold her weal Above all other objects of thy love In good or adverse fortune. Asan. Nay, my lord, There is no need for oaths; yet will I swear it, Here on this soldier's cross. [Makes a cross with the hilt of his sword. Farewell, my father, I mar my manhood, staying. King. Farewell, son. Let my old eyes fix on thee till thou goest Beneath the farthest verge. Good Megacles, And you brave gentlemen, be faithful all To me and to your Prince. Lys. My Lord Asander, Remember! ACT II. SCENE I.‚ÄîLamachus' Palace, Cherson. Gycia and Irene. Gycia. Sweetest Irene, What joy it is to see thee once again After so long an absence! We had grown Together on one stalk so long, since first Our girlish lives began to burst to flower, That it was hard to part us. But me thinks That something of the rose from off thy cheek Has faded, and its rounded outline fair Seems grown a little thinner. Ire. Gycia, The flower, once severed from the stalk, no more Grows as before. Gycia. Thou strange girl, to put on Such grave airs! Ah! I fear at Bosphorus Some gay knight has bewitched thee; thou has fallen In love, as girls say‚Äîthough what it may be To fall in love, I know not, thank the gods, Having much else to think of. Ire. Prithee, dear, Speak not of this. Gycia. Ah! then I know 'tis true. Confess what manner of thing love is. Ire. Nay, nay, I cannot tell thee (weeping), Gycia; Thou knowest not what thou askest. What is love? Seek not to know it. 'Tis to be no more Thy own, but all another's; 'tis to dwell By day and night on one fixed madding thought, Till the form wastes, and with the form the heart Is warped from right to wrong, and can forget All that it loved before, faith, duty, country, Friendship, affection‚Äîeverything but love. Seek not to know it, dear; or, knowing it, Be happier than I. Gycia. My poor Irene! Then, 'tis indeed a misery to love. I do repent that I have tortured thee By such unthinking jests. Forgive me, dear, I will speak no more of it; with me thy secret Is safe as with a sister. Shouldst thou wish To unburden to me thy unhappy heart, If haply I might bring thy love to thee. Thou shalt his name divulge and quality, And I will do my best. Ire. Never, dear Gycia. Forget my weakness; 'twas a passing folly, I love a man who loves me not again, And that is very hell. I would die sooner Than breathe his name to thee. Fare-well, dear lady! Thou canst not aid me. [Exit Irene. Gycia. Hapless girl! Praise Heaven That I am fancy-free! Enter Lamachus. Lama. My dearest daughter, why this solemn aspect? I have glad news for thee. Thou knowest of old The weary jealousies, the bloody feuds, Which 'twixt our Cherson and her neighbour City Have raged ere I was born‚Äînay, ere my grandsire First saw the light of heaven. Both our States Are crippled by this brainless enmity. And now the Empire, now the Scythian, threatens Destruction to our Cities, whom, united, We might defy with scorn. Seeing this weakness, Thy father, wishful, ere his race be run, To save our much-loved Cherson, sent of late Politic envoys to our former foe, And now‚Äîi' faith, I am not so old, 'twould seem That I have lost my state-craft‚Äîcomes a message. The Prince Asander, heir of Bosphorus, Touches our shores to-day, and presently Will be with us. Gycia. Oh, father, is it wise? Do fire and water mingle? Does the hawk Mate with the dove; the tiger with the lamb; The tyrant with the peaceful common-wealth; Fair commerce with the unfruitful works of war? What union can there be 'twixt our fair city And this half-barbarous race? 'Twere against nature To bid these opposite elements combine‚Äî The Greek with the Cimmerian. Father, pray you, Send them away, with honour if you please, And soothing words and gifts‚Äîonly, I pray you, Send them away, this Prince who doth despise us, And his false retinue of slaves. Lama. My daughter, Thy words are wanting in thy wonted love And dutiful observance. 'Twere an insult Unwashed by streams of bloodshed, should our City Scorn thus the guests it summoned. Come they must, And with all hospitable care and honour, Else were thy sire dishonoured. Thou wilt give them A fitting welcome. Gycia. Pardon me, my father, That I spoke rashly. I obey thy will. [Going. Lama. Stay, Gycia. Dost thou know what 'tis to love? Gycia. Ay, thee, dear father. Lama. Nay, I know it well. But has no noble youth e'er touched thy heart? Gycia. None, father, Heaven be praised! The young Irene Was with me when thou cam'st, and all her life Seems blighted by this curse of love for one Whose name she hides, with whom in Bosphorus She met, when there she sojourned. Her young brother, The noble Theodorus, whom thou knowest, Lets all the world go by him and grows pale For love, and pines, and wherefore?‚ÄîFor thy daughter, Who knows not what love means, and cannot brook Such brain-sick folly. Nay, be sure, good father, I love not thus, and shall not. Lama. Well, well, girl, Thou wilt know it yet. I fetter not thy choice, But if thou couldst by loving bind together Not two hearts only, but opposing peoples; Supplant by halcyon days long years of strife, And link them in unbroken harmony;‚Äî Were this no glory for a woman, this No worthy price of her heart? Gycia. Tell me, I pray, What mean you by this riddle? Lama. Prince Asander Comes here to ask your hand, and with it take A gracious dower of peace and amity. He does not ask thee to forsake thy home, But leaves for thee his own. All tongues together Are full of praise of him: virgin in love, A brave youth in the field, as we have proved In many a mortal fight; a face and form Like a young god's. I would, my love, thy heart Might turn to him, and find thy happiness In that which makes me happy. I am old And failing, and I fain would see thee blest Before I die, and at thy kness an heir To all my riches, and the State of Cherson From anxious cares delivered, and through thee. Gycia. Father, we are of the Athenian race, Which was the flower of Hellas. Ours the fame Of Poets, Statesmen, Orators, whose works And thoughts upon the forehead of mankind Shine like a precious jewel; ours the glory Of those great Soldiers who by sea and land Scattered the foemen to the winds of heaven, First in the files of time. And though our mother, Our Athens, sank, crushed by the might of Rome, What is Rome now?‚ÄîAn Empire rent in twain; An Empire sinking 'neath the unwieldy weight Of its own power; an Empire where the Senate Ranks lower than the Circus, and a wanton Degrades the Imperial throne. But though to its fall The monster totters, this our Cherson keeps The bravery of old, and still maintains The old Hellenic spirit and some likeness Of the fair Commonwealth which ruled the world. Surely, my father, 'tis a glorious spring Drawn from the heaven-kissed summits whence we come; And shall we, then, defile our noble blood By mixture with this upstart tyranny Which fouls the Hellenic pureness of its source In countless bastard channels? If our State Ask of its children sacrifice, 'tis well. It shall be given; only I prithee, father, Seek not that I should with barbaric blood Taint the pure stream, which flows from Pericles. Let me abide unwedded, if I may, A Greek girl as before. Lama. Daughter, thy choice Is free as air to accept or to reject This suitor; only, in the name of Cherson, Do nothing rashly, and meanwhile take care That naught that fits a Grecian State be wanting To do him honour. Gycia. Sir, it shall be done. SCENE II.‚ÄîOutside the palace of Lamachus. Megacles and Courtiers. Meg. Well, my lords, and so this is the palace. A grand palace, forsooth, and a fine reception to match! Why, these people are worse than barbarians. They are worse than the sea, and that was inhospitable enough. The saints be praised that that is over, at any rate. Oh, the intolerable scent of pitch, and the tossing and the heaving! Heaven spare me such an ordeal again! I thought I should have died of the smells. And here, can it be? Is it possible that there is a distinct odour of‚Äîpah! what? Oils, as I am a Christian, and close to the very palace of the Archon! What a detestable people! Some civet, good friends, some civet! 1st Court. Here it is, good Megacles. You did not hope, surely, to find republicans as sweet as those who live cleanly under a King? But here are some of their precious citizens at last. Enter Citizens hurriedly. 1st Citizen. I pray you, forgive us, gentlemen. We thought the Prince would take the land at the other quay, and had prepared our welcome accordingly. Meg. Who are these men? 1st Court. They are honourable citizens of Cherson. Meg. Citizens! They will not do for me. The Count of the Palace should be here with the Grand Chamberlain to meet my Master. 1st Cit. Your Master? Oh! then you are a serving man, as it would seem. Well, my good man, when comes your Master? Meg. Oh, the impertinent scoundrel! Do you know, sir, who I am? 1st Cit. Probably the Prince's attendant, his lackey, or possibly his steward. I neither know nor care. Meg. Oh, you barbarian! Where is the Count of the Palace, I say? 1st Cit. Now, citizen, cease this nonsense. We have not, thank Heaven, any such foolish effeminate functionary. Meg. No Count of the Palace? Heavens! what a crew! Well, if there is none, where are your leading nobles? where the Respectable and Illustrious? You are certainly not Illustrious nor Respectable; you probably are not even Honourable, or if you are you don't look it. 1st Cit. What, you wretched popinjay of a serving man! You dare address a Greek citizen in that way? Take that, and that! [Beats him. 1st Court. Draw, gentlemen! These are ruffians! [They fight. Enter Asander. Asan. Put up your swords, gentlemen. Why, fellows, what is this? Is this your hospitality to your guests? 1st Cit. Nay, sir; but this servant of yours has been most insolent, and has abused and insulted our State and its manners. He told us that we were not men of honour; and some of us, sir, are young, and have hot blood, and, as Greek citizens of Cherson, will not bear insults. Asan. Insolent upstarts, you are not worthy of our swords! Come, my Lord Megacles, heed them not. Here is their master. Enter Lamachus and Senators. Lama. We bid you heartfelt welcome, Prince, to Cherson. That we have seemed to fail to do you honour Comes of the spite of fortune, For your highness, Taking the land at the entrance of the port, Missed what of scanty pomp our homely manners Would fain have offered; but we pray you think 'Twas an untoward accident, no more. Welcome to Cherson, Prince! Asan. Methinks, my lord, Scarce in the meanest State is it the custom To ask the presence of a noble guest With much insistance, and when he accepts The summons, and has come, to set on him With insolent dogs like these. Lama. Nay, Prince, I pray you, What is it that has been? Asan. Our chamberlain Was lately, in your absence, which your highness So glibly doth excuse, set on and beaten By these dogs here. Lama. Nay, sir, they are not dogs, But citizens of honour; yet indeed Wanting, I fear, in that deep courtesy Which from a stranger and a guest refuses To take provoked offence. My lord, indeed I am ashamed that citizens of Cherson Should act so mean a part. Come, Prince, I pray you Forget this matter, and be sure your coming Fills me with joy. Go, tell the Lady Gycia The Prince is safe in Cherson. Enter Gycia, Irene, Melissa, and Ladies. Irene, seeing Asander, faints, and is withdrawn, Gycia supporting her. Confusion. Meg. My Lord Asander, remember what is due to yourself and Bosphorus. Remember, when this merchant's daughter comes, you must not treat her as an equal. Courtesy to a woman is all very well, but rank has greater claims still, especially when you have to deal with such people as these. Now, remember, you must make no obeisance at all; and if you advance to meet her more than one step, you are lost for ever. These are the truly important things. Asan. Good Megacles, Forewarned I am forearmed. (Aside) Thou fluent trickster! Fit head of such a State! I would to Heaven I had never come! Re-enter Gycia. Nay, nay, I thank the saints That I have come. Who is this peerless creature? Is this the old man's daughter? Lama. Prince Asander, This is my daughter, Gycia. Of the prince Thou hast heard many a time, my daughter. Gycia (confused). Ay!‚Äî Indeed I‚Äî Lama. Come, my girl, thou art not used To fail of words. Asan. Nay, sir, I pray you press her not to speak. And yet I fain would hear her. Artemis Showed not so fair, nor with a softer charm Came Hebe's voice. Gycia. Nay, sir, I did not know A soldier could thus use a courtier's tongue. Asan. If being bred in courts would give me power To put my thought in words, then would I fain Be courtier for thy sake. Gycia. Ah, sir, you jest. The ways of courts we know not, but I bid thee Good welcome to our city, and I prithee Command whatever service our poor Cherson Can give whilst thou art here. (To Megacles) Pray you my lord, Accompany his Highness and our house-hold To the poor chambers which our homely state Allots for him. They are but poor, I know, For one who lives the stately life of kings; But such as our scant means can reach they are. Meg. My lady, I have lived long time in courts, But never, in the palaces of Rome, Have I seen beauty such as yours, or grace More worthy of a crown. (To Melissa) To you, my lady, I bow with most respectful homage. Surely The goddess Her√© has not left the earth While you are here. I humbly take my leave For the present of your Highness with a thousand Obeisances, and to your gracious father Humbly I bend the knee. My Lord Asander, I do attend your Highness. Mel. What a man! What noble manners! What a polished air! How poor to such a courtier our rude Court And humble manners show! Asan. Good Megacles, Get me to my chamber‚Äîquick, ere I o'erpass All reasonable limits. I am sped; I am myself no more. Lama. Farewell awhile. We will welcome you at supper. [Exeunt all but Lamachus and Gycia. Lama. Well, my daughter, What think you of this hot-brained youth? I' faith, I like his soldier's bluntness, and he seemed To be a little startled, as I thought, By something which he saw when thou didst come. Perchance it was the charm of one who came Among thy ladies took him. Gycia. Nay, my father, I think not so indeed. Lama. Ah! well, I am old, And age forgets. But this I tell thee, daughter: If in my youth I had seen a young man's gaze Grow troubled, and he should start, and his cheek pale, A young girl drawing near, I had almost thought Him suddenly in love. Gycia. Oh, nay indeed! Who should be favoured thus? There is no woman In our poor Cherson worthy that his gaze Might rest on her a moment. Lama. Ah, my girl, Is it thus with thee? They say that love is blind, And thou art blind, therefore it may be, Gycia, That thou too art in love. Tell me how it is. Couldst thou love this man, if he loved thee? Gycia. (throwing herself on her father's neck). Father! Lama. Say no more, girl. I am not so old as yet That I have quite forgotten my own youth, When I was young and loved; and if I err not, I read love's fluttering signals on thy cheek, And in his tell-tale eyes. But listen! Music! We must prepare for supper with our guests. SCENE III.‚ÄîA street in Cherson. Megacles; afterwards Melissa. Megacles. Well, it is time for the banquet. Somehow, this place improves on acquaintance, after all. Poor, of course, and rude to a degree. But truly the Lady Gycia is fair‚Äîas fair, indeed, as if she was the Emperor's daughter. She is a beautiful creature, truly. But give me that delightful lady-in-waiting of hers, the Lady Melissa. What grace! what rounded proportions! I like mature beauty. She is as like the late divine Empress as two peas, and I thought‚ÄîI dare say I was wrong, but I really thought‚ÄîI made an impression. Poor things! poor things! They can't help themselves. We courtiers really ought to be very careful not to abuse our power. It is positive cruelty. The contest is too unequal. It makes one inclined sometimes to put on the manners of a clown, so as to give them a chance. Nay, nay, you might as well ask the Ethiopian to change his skin as a courtier his fine manners. By all the saints! here she comes in propri√¢ person√¢. Enter the Lady Melissa. Mel. Heavens! it is the strange nobleman. I am sure I am all of a flutter. Meg. (advancing with formal bows). My lady, I am enchanted (bows again; then takes several steps to the right, then to the left, and bows). What a wonderful good fortune! Ever since I had the honour to see you just now, I have only lived in the hope of seeing you again. Mel. (curtsying). Oh, my lord, you great courtiers can find little to interest you in our poor little Court and its humble surroundings. Meg. Madam, I beg! not a word! I was just thinking that you exactly resembled the late divine Empress. Mel. Oh, my lord, forbear! The Empress! and I have never been out of Cherson! You flatter me, you flatter me, indeed. That is the way with all you courtiers from Constantinople. Now, if you had said that my Lady Gycia was beautiful‚Äî Meg. My dear lady, I do not admire her in the least. She has no manners, really‚Äînothing, at any rate, to attract a man of the great world; a mere undeveloped girl, with all the passion to come. No, no, my good lady, give me a woman who has lived. We courtiers know manners and breeding when we see them, and yours are simply perfect, not to say Imperial. Mel. What a magnificent nature! Well, to say the truth, the Lady Gycia is not at all to my taste. It is a cold, insipid style of beauty, at the best; and she is as self-willed and as straitlaced as a lady abbess. I suppose she is well matched with the Prince Asander? Meg. Well, he is a handsome lad enough, and virtuous, but weak, as youth always is, and pliable. Now, for myself, I am happy to say I am steadfast and firm as a rock. Mel. Ah, my lord, if all women saw with my eyes, there would not be such a run after youth. Give me a mature man, who has seen the world and knows something of life and manners. Meg. What an intelligent creature! Madam, your sentiments do you credit. I beg leave to lay at your feet the assurance of my entire devotion. Mel. Oh, my lord, you are too good! Why, what a dear, condescending creature!‚Äîthe manners of a Grand Chamberlain and the features of an Apollo! Meg. Permit me to enrol myself among the ranks of your humble slaves and admirers (kneels and kisses her hand). But hark! the music, and I must marshal the guests to the banquet. Permit me to marshal you. [Exeunt with measured steps. SCENE IV.‚ÄîThe garden without the banqueting-room. Moonlight. The sea in the distance, with the harbour. Asander and Gycia descend the steps of the palace slowly together. Music heard from within the hall. Asan. Come, Gycia, let us take the soft sweet air Beneath the star of love. The festive lights Still burn within the hall, where late we twain Troth-plighted sate, and I from out thine eyes Drank long, deep draughts of love stronger than wine. And still the minstrels sound their dulcet strains, Which then I heard not, since my ears were filled With the sweet music of thy voice. My sweet, How blest it is, left thus alone with love, To hear the love-lorn nightingales complain Beneath the star-gemmed heavens, and drink cool airs Fresh from the summer sea! There sleeps the main Which once I crossed unwilling. Was it years since, In some old vanished life, or yesterday When saw I last my father and the shores Of Bosphorus? Was it days since, or years, Tell me, thou fair enchantress, who hast wove So strong a spell around me? Gycia. Nay, my lord; Tell thou me first what magic 'tis hath turned A woman who had scoffed so long at love Until to-day‚Äîto-day, whose blessed night Is hung so thick with stars‚Äîto feel as I, That I have found the twin life which the gods Retained when mine was fashioned, and must turn To what so late was strange, as the flower turns To the sun; ay, though he withers her, or clouds Come 'twixt her and her light, turns still to him, And only gazing lives. Asan. Thou perfect woman! And art thou, then, all mine? What have I done, What have I been, that thus the favouring gods And the consentient strength of hostile States Conspire to make me happy? Ah! I fear, Lest too great happiness be but a snare Set for our feet by Fate, to take us fast And then despoil our lives. Gycia. My love, fear not. We have found each other, and no power has strength To put our lives asunder. Asan. Thus I seal Our contract with a kiss. [Kisses her. Gycia. Oh, happiness! To love and to be loved! And yet methinks Love is not always thus. To some he brings Deep disappointment only, and the pain Of melancholy years. I have a lady Who loves, but is unloved. Poor soul! she lives A weary life. Some youth of Bosphorus Stole her poor heart. Asan. Of Bosphorus saidst thou? And her name is? Gycia. Irene. Didst thou know her? Asan. Nay, love, or if I did I have forgot her. Gycia. Poor soul! to-day when first we met, she saw Her lover 'midst thy train and swooned away. Asan. Poor heart! This shall be seen to. Tell me, Gycia, Didst love me at first sight? Gycia. Unreasonable, To bid me tell what well thou knowest already. Thou know'st I did. And when did love take thee? Asan. I was wrapt up in spleen and haughty pride, When, looking up, a great contentment took me, Shed from thy gracious eyes. Nought else I saw, Than thy dear self. Gycia. And hadst thou ever loved? Asan. Never, dear Gycia. I have been so rapt in warlike enterprises Or in the nimble chase, all my youth long, That never had I looked upon a woman With thought of love before, though it may be That some had thought of me, being a Prince And heir of Bosphorus. Gycia. Not for thyself; That could not be. Deceiver! Asan. Nay, indeed! Gycia. Oh, thou dear youth! Asan. I weary for the day When we our mutual love shall crown with marriage. Gycia. Not yet, my love, we are so happy now. Asan. But happier then, dear Gycia. Gycia. Nay, I know not If I could bear it and live. But hark, my love! The music ceases, and the sated guests Will soon be sped. Thou must resume thy place Of honour for a little. I must go, If my reluctant feet will bear me hence, To dream of thee the livelong night. Farewell, Farewell till morning. All the saints of heaven Have thee in keeping! Asan. Go not yet, my sweet; And yet I bid thee go. Upon thy lips I set love's seal, thus, thus. [Kisses her. They embrace. Good night! Gycia. Good night! [Exit Gycia. Enter Irene unperceived. Asan. Ah, sweetest, best of women! paragon Of all thy sex, since first thy ancestress Helen, the curse of cities and of men, Marshalled the hosts of Greece! But she brought discord; Thou, by thy all-compelling sweetness, peace And harmony for strife. What have I done, I a rough soldier, like a thousand others Upon our widespread plains, to have won this flower Of womanhood‚Äîthis jewel for the front Of knightly pride to wear, and, wearing it, Let all things else go by? To think that I, Fool that I was, only a few hours since, Bemoaned the lot which brought me here and bade me Leave my own land, which now sinks fathoms deep Beyond my memory's depths, and scarce would deign To obey thee, best of fathers, when thy wisdom Designed to make me blest! Was ever woman So gracious and so comely? And I scorned her For her Greek blood and love of liberty! Fool! purblind fool! there is no other like her; I glory being her slave. Irene. I pray you, pardon me, my Lord Asander. I seek the Lady Gycia; is she here? Asan. No, madam; she has gone, and with her taken The glory of the night. But thou dost love her‚Äî Is it not so, fair lady? Ire. Ay, my lord, For we have lived together all our lives; I could not choose but love. Asan. Well said indeed. Tell me, and have I seen thy face before? A something in it haunts me. Ire. Ay, my lord. Am I forgot so soon? Asan. Indeed! Thy name? Where have I seen thee? Ire. Where? Dost thou, then, ask? Asan. Ay; in good truth, my treacherous memory Betrays me here. Ire. Thou mayest well forget My name, if thou hast quite forgot its owner. [Weeps. I am called Irene. Asan. Strange! the very name My lady did relate to me as hers Who bears a hopeless love. Weep not, good lady; Take comfort. Heaven is kind. Ire. Nay, my good lord, What comfort? He I love loves not again, Or not me, but another. Asan. Ah, poor lady! I pity you indeed, now I have known True recompense of love. Ire. Dost thou say pity? And pity as they tell's akin to love. What comfort is for me, my Lord Asander, Who love one so exalted in estate That all return of honourable love Were hopeless, as if I should dare to raise My eyes to C√¶sar's self? What comfort have I, If lately I have heard this man I love Communing with his soul, when none seemed near, Betray a heart flung prostrate at the feet Of another, not myself; and well I know Not Lethe's waters can wash out remembrance Of that o'ermastering passion‚Äînaught but death Or hopeless depths of crime? Asan. Lady, I pity Thy case, and pray thy love may meet return. Ire. Then wilt thou be the suppliant to thyself, And willing love's requital, Oh, requite it! Thou art my love, Asander‚Äîthou, none other. There is naught I would not face, if I might win thee. That I a woman should lay bare my soul; Disclose the virgin secrets of my heart To one who loves me not, and doth despise The service I would tender! Asan. Cease, I pray you; These are distempered words. Ire. Nay, they are true, And come from the inner heart. Leave these strange shores And her you love. I know her from a child. She is too high and cold for mortal love; Too wrapt in duty, and high thoughts of State, Artemis and Athen√© fused in one, Ever to throw her life and maiden shame As I do at thy feet. [Kneels. Asan. Rise, lady, rise; I am not worthy such devotion. Ire. Take me Over seas; I care not where. I'll be thy slave, Thy sea-boy; follow thee, ill-housed, disguised, Through hardship and through peril, so I see Thy face sometimes, and hear sometimes thy voice, For I am sick with love. Asan. Lady, I prithee Forget these wild words. I were less than man Should I remember them, or take the gift Which 'tis not reason offers. I knew not Thy passion nor its object, nor am free To take it, for the vision of my soul Has looked upon its sun, and turns no more To any lower light. Ire. My Lord Asander, She is not for thee; she cannot make thee happy, Nor thou her. Oh, believe me! I am full Of boding thoughts of the sure fatal day Which shall dissolve in blood the bonds which love To-day has plighted. If thou wilt not take me, Then get thee gone alone. I see a fire Which burns more fierce than love, and it consumes thee. Fly with me, or alone, but fly. Asan. Irene, Passion distracts thy brain. I pray you, seek Some mutual love as I. My heart is fixed, And gone beyond recall. [Exit. Enter Theodorus unseen. Ire. (weeping passionately). Disgraced! betrayed! Rejected! All the madness of my love Flung back upon me, as one spurns a gift Who scorns the giver. That I love him still, And cannot hate her who has robbed me of him! I shall go mad with shame! Theo. Great Heaven! sister, What words are these I hear? My father's daughter Confessing to her shame! [Irene weeps Come, tell me, woman; I am thy brother and protector, tell me What mean these words? Ire. Nay, nay, I cannot, brother. They mean not what they seem, indeed they do not. Theo. They mean not what they seem! Thou hast been long In Bosphorus, and ofttimes at the Court Hast seen the Prince. When he to-day comes hither, Thou swoonest at the sight. I, seeking thee, Find thee at night alone, he having left thee, Lamenting for thy shame. Wouldst have me credit Thy innocence? Speak, if thou hast a word To balance proofs like these, or let thy silence Condemn thee. Ire. (after a pause, and slowly, as if calculating consequences). Then do I keep silence, brother, And let thy vengeance fall. Theo. Oh, long-dead mother, Who now art with the saints, shut fast thy ears Against thy daughter's shame! These are the things That make it pain to live: all precious gifts, Honour, observance, virtue, flung away For one o'ermastering passion. Why are we Above the brute so far, if we keep still The weakness of the brute? Go from my sight, Thou vile, degraded wretch. For him whose craft And wickedness has wronged thee, this I swear‚Äî I will kill him, if I can, or he shall me. I will call on him to draw, and make my sword Red with a villain's blood. Ire. (eagerly). Nay, nay, my brother, That would proclaim my shame; and shouldst thou slay him, Thou wouldst break thy lady's heart. Theo. Doth she so love him? Ire. Ay, passionately, brother. Theo. Oh, just Heaven! And oh, confus√®d world! How are we fettered here! I may not kill A villain who has done my sister wrong, Since she I love has given her heart to him, And hangs upon his life. I would not pain My Gycia with the smallest, feeblest pang That wrings a childish heart, for all the world. How, then, to kill her love, though killing him Would rid the world of a villain, and would leave My lady free to love? 'Twere not love's part To pain her thus, not for the wealth and power Of all the world heaped up. I tell thee, sister, Thy paramour is safe‚ÄîI will not seek To do him hurt; but thou shalt go tonight To my Bithynian castle. Haply thence, After long penances and recluse days, Thou mayst return, and I may bear once more To see my sister's face. Ire. Farewell, my brother! I do obey; I bide occasion, waiting For what the years may bring. Theo. Repent thy sin. ACT III. SCENE I.‚ÄîCherson, two years after. The palace of Lamachus. Asander and Gycia. Gycia. What day is this, Asander? Canst thou tell me? Asan. Not I, my love. All days are now alike; The weeks fleet by, the days equivalent gems Strung on a golden thread. Gycia. Thou careless darling! I did not ask thee of the calendar. Dost think a merchant's daughter knows not that? Nay, nay; I only asked thee if thou knewest If aught upon this day had ever brought Some great change to thee. Asan. Sweetest, dearest wife, Our marriage! Thinkest thou I should forget, Ay, though the chills of age had froze my brain, That day of all my life? Gycia. Dost thou regret it? I think thou dost not, but 'tis sweet to hear The avowal from thy lips? Asan. Nay, never a moment. And thou? Gycia. Nay, never for a passing thought. I did not know what life was till I knew thee. Dost thou remember it, how I came forth, Looking incuriously to see the stranger, And lo! I spied my love, and could not murmur A word of courtesy? Asan. Dost thou remember How I, a feverish and hot-brained youth, Full of rash pride and princely arrogance, Lifted my eyes and saw a goddess coming‚Äî Gycia. Nay, a weak woman only. Asan. And was tamed By the first glance? Gycia. What! are we lovers still, After two years of marriage? Asan. Is it two years, Or twenty? By my faith, I know not which, For happy lives glide on like seaward streams Which keep their peaceful and unruffled course So smoothly that the voyager hardly notes The progress of the tide. Ay, two years 'tis, And now it seems a day, now twenty years, But always, always happy. [Embraces Gycia. Gycia. Yet, my love, We have known trials too. My honoured sire Has gone and left us since. Asan. Ay, he had reaped The harvest of his days, and fell asleep Amid the garnered sheaves. Gycia. Dearest, I know He loved thee as a son, and always strove To fit thee for the place within our State Which one day should be thine. Sometimes I think, Since he has gone, I have been covetous Of thy dear love, and kept thee from the labour Of State-craft, and the daily manly toils Which do befit thy age; and I have thought, Viewing thee with the jealous eyes of love, That I have marked some shade of melancholy Creep on when none else saw thee, and desired If only I might share it. Asan. Nay, my love, I have been happy truly, though sometimes, It may be, I have missed the clear, brisk air Of the free plains; the trumpet-notes of war, When far against the sky the glint of spears Lit by the rising sun revealed the ranks Of the opposing host, the thundering onset Of fierce conflicting squadrons, and the advance Of the victorious hosts. Oh for the vigour And freshness of such life! But I have chosen To sleep on beds of down, as C√¶sar might, And live a woman's minion. Gycia. Good my husband, Thou shouldst not speak thus. I would have thee win Thy place in the Senate, rule our Cherson's fortunes, Be what my father was without the name, And gain that too in time. Asan. What! You would have me Cozen, intrigue, and cheat, and play the huckster, As your republicans, peace on their lips And subtle scheming treaties, till the moment When it is safe to spring? Would you have me cringe To the ignorant mob of churls, through whose sweet voices The road to greatness lies? Nay, nay; I am A King's son, and of Bosphorus, not Cherson‚Äî A Scythian more than Greek. Gycia. Nay, my good lord, Scythian or Greek, to me thou art more dear Than all the world beside. Yet will not duty, The memory of the dead, the love of country, The pride of the great race from which we spring, Suffer my silence wholly, hearing thee. It is not true that men Athenian-born Are of less courage, less of noble nature, More crafty in design, less frank of purpose, Than are thy countrymen. They have met and fought them, Thou knowest with what fate. For polity I hold it better that self-governed men Should, using freedom, but eschewing license, Fare to what chequered fate the will of Heaven Reserves for them, than shackled by the chains The wisest tyrant, gilding servitude With seeming gains, imposes. We are free In speech, in council, in debate, in act, As when our great Demosthenes hurled back Defiance to the tyrant. Nay, my lord, Forgive my open speech. I have not forgot That we are one in heart and mind and soul, Knit in sweet bonds for ever. Put from thee This jaundiced humour. If State-craft please not, by the headlong chase Which once I know thou lovedst. Do not grudge To leave me; for to-day my bosom friend, After two years of absence, comes to me. I shall not feel alone, having Irene. Asan. Whom dost thou say? Irene? Gycia. Yes, the same. She was crossed in love, poor girl, dost thou remember, When we were wed? Asan. Gycia, I mind it well. Send her away‚Äîshe is no companion for thee; She is not fit, I say. Gycia. What is't thou sayest? Thou canst know nought of her. Nay, I remember, When I did ask thee if thou knewest her At Bosphorus, thou answeredst that thou didst not. Asan. I know her. She is no fit mate for thee. Gycia. Then, thou didst know her when thy tongue denied it. Asan. How 'tis I know her boots not; I forbid My wife to know that woman. Send her hence. Gycia. Nay, nay, my lord, it profits not to quarrel. Thou art not thyself. Either thou knew'st her name When we were wedded, or unreasoning spleen Doth blind thy judgment since. Thou canst not know her Who has been absent. Asan. Ask no more, good wife; I give no reason. Gycia. Nay, indeed, good husband, Thou hast no reason, and without good reason I will not spurn my friend. Asan. Gycia, forgive me; I spoke but for our good, and I will tell thee One day what stirs within me, but to-day Let us not mar our happy memories By any shade of discord. Gycia. Oh, my love, Forgive me if I have seemed, but for a moment, To fail in duty. I am all, all thine; I have nought but thee to live for. Childish hands And baby voices lisping for their mother Are not for me, nor thee; but, all in all, We joy together, we sorrow together, and last Shall die, when the hour comes, as something tells me, Both in the selfsame hour. Asan. Nay, wife, we are young; Our time is not yet come. Let us speak now Of what I know thou holdest near thy heart. I do remember that it was thy wish To celebrate thy father's name and fame By some high festal. If thy purpose hold For such observance, the sad day which took him Returns a short time hence; I will employ Whatever wealth is mine to do him honour, And thee, my Gycia. Honouring the sire, I honour too the child. Gycia. My love, I thank thee For this spontaneous kindness, and I love thee; I am all thine own again. Come, let us go; Nor spare the wealth wherewith his bounty blest us To do fit honour to the illustrious dead. [Exeunt. SCENE II.‚ÄîThe same. Megacles, Courtiers; afterwards Asander. Meg. Well, my lords, two years have passed since we left our Bosphorus, and I see no sign of our returning there. If it were not for that delightful Lady Melissa, whose humble slave I am always (Courtiers laugh), I would give all I am worth to turn my back upon this scurvy city and its republican crew. But my Lord Asander is so devoted to his fair lady‚Äîand, indeed, I can hardly wonder at it‚Äîthat there seems no hope of our seeing the old shores again. I thought he would have been off long ago. 1st Court. A model husband the Prince, a paragon of virtue. 2nd Court. Well, there is no great merit in being faithful to a rich and beautiful woman. I think I could be as steady as a rock under the like conditions. 3rd Court. Well, mind ye, it is not every man who could treat the very marked overtures of the fair Lady Irene as he did. And he had not seen his wife then, either. No; the man is a curious mixture, somewhat cold, and altogether constant, and that is not a bad combination to keep a man straight with the sex. Poor soul! do you remember how she pursued him at Bosphorus, and how she fainted away at the wedding? They say she is coming back speedily, in her right mind. She has been away ever since, no one knows where. That solemn brother of hers conveyed her away privily. 1st Court. I hate that fellow‚Äîa canting hypocrite, a solemn impostor! 2nd Court. So say we all. But mark you, if the Lady Irene comes back, there will be mischief before long. What news from Bosphorus, my Lord Megacles? Meg. I have heard a rumour, my lord, that his Majesty the King is ailing. 1st Court. Nay, is he? Then there may be a new King and a new Queen, and we shall leave this dog-hole and live at home like gentlemen once more. 3rd Court. Then would his sacred Majesty's removal be a blessing in disguise. 2nd Court. Ay, indeed would it. Does the Prince know of it? Meg. I have not told him aught, having, indeed, nothing certain to tell; but he soon will, if it be true. But here his Highness comes. Enter Asander. My Lord Asander, your Highness's humble servant welcomes you with [Bows low. effusion. Asan. Well, my good Megacles, and you, my lords. There will be ample work for you all ere long. The Lady Gycia is projecting a great festival in memory of her father, and all that the wealth of Cherson can do to honour him will be done. There will be solemn processions, a banquet, and a people's holiday. Dost thou not spy some good ceremonial work there, my good Megacles? Why, thou wilt be as happy as if thou wert at Byzantium itself, marshalling the processions, arranging the banquet, ushering in the guests in due precedence, the shipowner before the merchant, the merchant before the retailer. Why, what couldst thou want more, old Trusty? [Laughs. Meg. Ah, my Lord Prince, your Highness is young. When you are as old as I am, you will not scoff at Ceremony. This is the pleasantest day that I have spent since your Highness's wedding-day. I thank you greatly, and will do my best, your Highness. Asan. That I am sure of, good Megacles. Good day, my lords, good day. [Exeunt Megacles and Courtiers. Enter Messenger. Mess. My Lord Asander, a messenger from Bosphorus has just landed, bringing this letter for your Highness. Asan. Let me see it. (Reads) ‚ÄúLysimachus to Asander sends greeting. Thy father is failing fast, and is always asking for his son. Thou art free, and must come to him before he dies. I have much to say to thee, having heard long since of a festival in memory of Lamachus to be held shortly. I will be with thee before then. Be ready to carry out the plan which I have formed for thy good, and will reveal to thee. Remember.‚Äù My father ailing? And asks for me, and I his only son Chained here inactive, while the old man pines In that great solitude which hems a throne, With none but hirelings round him. Dearest father, I fear that sometimes in the happy years Which have come since, my wandering regards, Fixed on one overmastering thought, have failed To keep their wonted duty. If indeed This thing has been, I joy the time has come When I may show my love. But I forget! The fetters honour binds are adamant; I am free no more. Nay, nay, there is no bond Can bind a son who hears his father's voice Call from a bed of pain. I must go and will, Though all the world cry shame on my dishonour; And with me I will take my love, my bride, To glad the old man's eyes. My mind is fixed; I cannot stay, I cannot rest, away From Bosphorus. (Summons Messenger) Go, call the Lady Gycia. (Resumes) Ay, and my oath, I had forgotten it. I cannot bear to think what pitiless plot Lysimachus has woven for the feast. What it may be I know not, but I fear Some dark and dreadful deed. 'Twere well enough For one who never knew the friendly grasp Of hands that once were foemen's, But for me, Who have lived among them, come and gone with them, Trodden with them the daily paths of life, Mixed in their pleasures, shared their hopes and fears For two long happy years, to turn and doom Their city to ruin, and their wives and children To the insolence of rapine? Nay, I dare not. I will sail at once, and get me gone for ever. I will not tell my love that I am bound By her father's jealous fancies to return To Bosphorus no more. To break my oath! That were to break it only in the word, But keep it in the spirit. Surely Heaven For such an innocent perjury keeps no pains. But here she comes. Enter Gycia. Gycia. Didst send for me, my lord? Asan. Gycia, the King is ill, and asks for me; He is alone and weak. Gycia. Then, fly to him At once, and I will follow thee. But stay! Is he in danger? Asan. Nay, not presently; Only the increasing weight of years o'ersets His feeble sum of force. Gycia. Keeps he his bed? Asan. Not yet as I have known. Gycia. Well then, dear heart, We yet may be in time if we should tarry To celebrate the honours we have vowed To my dead father. This day sennight brings The day which saw him die. Asan. Nay, nay, my sweet; 'Twere best we went at once. Gycia. My lord, I honour The love thou bearest him, but go I cannot, Until the feast is done. 'Twould cast discredit On every daughter's love for her dead sire, If I should leave this solemn festival With all to do, and let the envious crowd Carp at the scant penurious courtesy Of hireling honours by an absent daughter To her illustrious dead. Asan. (earnestly). My love, 'twere best We both were far away. Gycia. My lord is pleased To speak in riddles, but till reason speaks 'Twere waste of time to listen. Asan. Nay, my wife, Such words become thee not, but to obey Is the best grace of woman. Were I able, I would tell thee all, I fear, for thee and me, But cannot. Gycia. Then, love, thou canst go alone, And I must follow thee. The Archon Zetho Comes presently, to order what remains To make the solemn festival do honour To the blest memory of Lamachus. Doubtless, he will devise some fitting pretext To excuse thy absence. Asan. Nay, thou must not ask him; Breathe not a word, I pray. Gycia. My good Asander, What is it moves thee thus? See, here he comes. Enter Zetho and Senators. Gycia. Good morrow, my Lord Zetho! We were late, Debating of the coming festival, And how my lord the Prince, having ill news From Bosphorus, where the King his sire lies sick, Can bear no part in it. Zetho. I grieve indeed To hear this news, and trust that Heaven may send Swift comfort to his son, whom we all love. Asan. I thank thee, Archon, for thy courtesy; And may thy wish come true. Gycia. And meantime, since my husband's heart is sore For his sire's lonelihood, our purpose is That he should sail to-morrow and go hence To Bosphorus, where I, the festival Being done, will join him later, and devote A daughter's loving care and tender hand To smooth the old man's sick-bed. Zetho. Nay, my daughter, I grieve this cannot be. The Prince Asander, Coming to Cherson only two years gone, Did pledge his solemn word to thy dead father That never would he seek, come foul or fair, To turn from Cherson homewards, and I marvel That never, in the years that since have passed Amid the close-knit bonds of wedded lives, He has revealed this secret. We who rule Our Cherson know through what blind shoals of fortune Our ship of state drives onward. And I dare not, Holding the rule which was thy father's once, Release him from the solemn pledge which keeps Our several States bound fast in amity, But each from the other separate, and each Free from the perils tangled intercourse Might breed for both. Indeed, it cannot be; I grieve that so it is. Gycia. My Lord Asander, Are these things so indeed? Asan. They are, my wife. A rash and heedless promise binds me fast, Which, in all frankness, I had never dreamt Could thus demand fulfilment. Who is there More loyal to the State than I? Who is there Bound by such precious chains of love and faith As is thy husband? If I said no word Of this before, it was that I would fain Forget this hateful compact. Sir, I beg you Let me go hence, and when the old man's sickness Is done, as Heaven will have it, take my word That I will be a citizen of Cherson Again, whate'er may come. Zetho. If the King dies, Then art thou straightway King of Bosphorus, Knowing the strength and weakness of our State, And having bound to thee by closest friendship Our chiefest citizens. Nay, nay, I dare not Relieve thee from the pledge. Asan. Thou hoary trickster, Speakest thou thus to me? [Draws. Gycia. (inter posing). Great heavens! Asander, Knowest thou what thou dost? (To Zetho) Pardon him, sir. He is not himself, I think, but half distraught, To bear himself thus madly. Zetho. Daughter, the State Knows to protect itself from insolence And arrogant pride like this, and it is certain 'Twas a wise caution led thy honoured father To stipulate that such ungoverned passion Should be cut off from those conspiring forces From which combined came danger. Asan. Gycia, Hearest thou this schemer? Dost thou know indeed That I am prisoned here, while my loved father Lies on the bed of death? Dost thou distrust me, That thou dost speak no word? Gycia. My lord, I cannot. The measure which my father's wisdom planned For the safety of the State, I, a weak woman, Am too infirm to judge. Thou didst not tell me, Asking that I should fly with thee, the bonds By which thy feet were fettered. Had I known I never had consented. Had I gone, Breaking the solemn ordinance of State, I should have left with thee my former love, And sailed back broken-hearted. That thou grievest There is none knows as I, but oh, my love! Though it be hard to bear, yet is grief lighter Than broken vows, and blighted honour, and laws Made to sustain the State, yet overset By one man's will. Dearest, we cannot go‚Äî Nor thou; the State forbids it. I will pray Thy father may grow strong again, and sit Here at our hearth a guest; but this is certain‚Äî To Bosphorus we go not. And I pray you Make to my lord, who fills my father's place, What reparation thy ungoverned rage And hasty tongue demand. Asan. Thou cold Greek woman! Of this, then, 'twas they warned me‚Äîa smooth tongue And a cold heart; a brain by logic ruled, And not at all by love. Thou hast no pity, For pity shapes not into syllogisms; Nor can affection ape philosophy, Nor natural love put on the formal robe Of cold too-balanced State-craft. Hear me, old man, And thou too, wife. 'Twere better, ay, far better, That I should get me gone, and my wife with me, Than be pent here unwilling; but were it better Or were it worse, be sure I will not stay When duty calls me hence. Wife, wilt thou come? Gycia. My lord, I cannot. Asan. Then, I go alone. Zetho. Nay, thou shalt not. Ho there! arrest the Prince. [Guards arrest Asander. Asan. Unhand me. At your peril. [Draws. Gycia. Oh, my husband! [Weeps. SCENE III.‚ÄîA room in the palace. Irene; afterwards Gycia. Ire. What! am I mad, or does some devilish power Possess me heart and soul? I once loved Gycia; I love Asander with o'ermastering love, And yet these frequent rumours of dissensions Marring the smooth course of their wedded life Bring me a swift, fierce joy. If aught befell To separate those lovers, then might Fate And Chance open for me the golden doors That lead to Love's own shrine; and yet I know not If any power might melt to mutual love That too-cold heart. But still, no other chance Is left but this alone: if I should force Those loving souls apart, then 'twere my turn. Am I a monster, then, to will this wrong? Nay, but a lovesick woman only, willing To dare all for her passion. Though I loathe Those crooked ways, yet love, despite myself, Drives me relentless onward. Enter Gycia. Dearest lady, Why art thou thus cast down? Some lovers' quarrel, To be interred with kisses? Gycia. Nay, Irene, This is no lovers' quarrel. Ire. Tell me, Gycia, What was the cause? Gycia. The King of Bosphorus Is ailing, and desires to see his son, Who fain would go to him. Ire. And thou refusedst To let thy lover go? [Laughs mockingly. Gycia. Nay, 'twas not so; But politic reasons of the State forbad The Prince's absence. Ire. Well, whate'er the cause, The old man fain would see his son, and thou Deniedst. Gycia. I denied him what the State Denied him, and no more. Ire. The State denied him! What does it profit thee to be the daughter Of Lamachus, if thou art fettered thus In each wish of thy heart? If it were I, And he my love, I would break all bonds that came Between me and my love's desire. Gycia. Irene, Thou know'st not what thou say'st. Ire. It may be so; I do not love by halves. Gycia. I do not need That thou shouldst tutor me, who am so blest In love's requital. I have nought to learn From thee, who bearest unrequited love For one thou wilt not name. Ire. Wouldst thou that I Should name him? Nay, it were best not, believe me, For me and thee. Gycia. Why, what were it to me, Thou luckless woman? Ire. What were it to thee? More than thou knowest, much. Gycia. And therefore 'tis That thou dost dare to tutor me to deal With the man I love, my husband. Ire. Gycia, Love is a tyrannous power, and brooks no rival Beside his throne. Dost thou, then, love indeed, Who art so filled with duty? Gycia. Do I love? Ay, from the depths of my enamoured heart! I am all his own to make or break at will. Only my duty to the State my mother And the thrice-bless√®d memory of my sire Forbids that I should sink my soul in his, Or, loving, grow unworthy. But, indeed, Thou pleadest his cause as if thyself did love him. Ire. As if I loved !‚Äîas if! Gycia. Indeed, 'tis well Thou didst not, were he free, for he, it seems, Has known of thee, and speaks not kindly words. I know not wherefore. Ire. Did he speak of me? Gycia. Ay, that he did. Ire. And what said he? Gycia. I think 'Twere best thou didst not know. Ire. Tell me, I prithee; I can bear to hear. Gycia. 'Twas but a hasty word, And best forgotten. Ire. But I prithee tell me, What said he? Gycia. That 'twere best I were alone Than commercing with thee, since thou wert not My fit companion. Ire. Said he that, the coward? Gycia. I am his wife, Irene. Ire. What care I? I have loved this man too well, before he saw thee. There, thou hast now my secret. I have loved him, And he loved me, and left me, and betrayed me. Was it for him to brand me with this stain? Unfit for thy companion! If I be, Whose fault is that but his, who found me pure And left me what I am? Gycia. What! dost thou dare Malign my husband thus? I have known his life From his own lips, and heard no word of thee. Ire. He did confess he knew me. Gycia. Ay, indeed, Not that he did thee wrong. Ire. My Lady Gycia, Did ever man confess he wronged a woman? If thou believe not me, who am indeed Disgraced, and by his fault, thou once didst love My brother Theodorus‚Äîsend for him. He is without, and waits me. Ask of him, Who has long known my secret. Gycia. I will ask him. Thou wretched woman, since thou art polluted, Whate'er my love may be, go from my sight, And send thy brother. Then betake thyself To a close prison in the haunted Tower, Till I shall free thee. Out of my sight, I say, Thou wanton! [Exit Irene. What have I done, how have I sinned, that Heaven Tortures me thus? How can I doubt this creature Speaks something of the truth? Did he not say At first he never knew that wanton's name? Did he not afterwards betray such knowledge Of her and of her life as showed the lie His former words concealed? And yet how doubt My dear, who by two years of wedded love Has knit my soul to his? I know how lightly The world holds manly virtue, but I hold The laws of honour are not made to bind Half of the race alone, leaving men licensed To break them when they will; but dread decrees Binding on all our kind. But oh, my love, I will not doubt thee, till conviction bring Proofs that I dare not doubt! Enter Theodorus. Theo. My Lady Gycia, I come at thy command. Gycia. Good Theodorus, Thou lovedst me once, I think? Theo. I loved thee once! Oh, heaven! Gycia. I am in great perplexity And sorrow, and I call upon thy friendship To succour me, by frank and free confession Of all thou knowest. Theo. I can refuse thee nothing, Only I beg that thou wilt ask me nought That answered may give pain. Gycia. Nay, it is best That I know all. I could not bear to live In ignorance, and yet I fear to grieve thee By what I ask. Thy sister late has left me‚Äî Theo. Ask not of her, I pray; I cannot answer. Gycia. Nay, by thy love I ask it. Answer me. Theo. Have me excused, I pray. Gycia. Then, I am answered. My husband, she affirms, betrayed her honour In Bosphorus, and now denies the crime. Thou knowest it true. Theo. Alas! I cannot doubt it. I have known all for years. Gycia. Ye saints of heaven! Is there no shame or purity in men, Nor room for trust in them? I am a wife Who thought she did possess her husband wholly, Virgin with virgin. I have thought I knew His inmost heart, and found it innocent; And yet while thus I held him, while I lay Upon his bosom, all these happy hours The venom of a shameful secret lurked Within his breast. Oh, monster of deceit, Thou never lovedst as I! That I should give The untouched treasure of my virgin heart For some foul embers of a burnt-out love, And lavish on the waste a wanton left My heart, my soul, my life! Oh, it is cruel! I will never see him more, nor hear his voice, But die unloved and friendless. [Weeps. Theo. (kneeling at her feet). Dearest Gycia, Thou canst not want a brother, friend, and lover While I am living. Oh, my love, my dear, Whom I have loved from childhood, put away This hateful marriage, free thee from the bonds Of this polluted wedlock, and make happy One who will love thee always! Enter Lysimachus unperceived. Gycia. Rise, Theodorus. I have no love to give. I am a wife. Such words dishonour me. Theo. Forgive me, Gycia. I know how pure thy soul, and would not have thee Aught other than thou art. Gycia. I do forgive thee. 'Twas love confused thy reason; but be brave. Set a guard on thy acts, thy words, thy thoughts. 'Tis an unhappy world! [Theodorus kisses her hand and exit. Lys. Most noble lady. Forgive me if at an unfitting time, Amid the soft devoirs of gallantry, I thus intrude unwilling; but I seek The Prince Asander. Gycia. I have nought to hide My husband might not know. Lys. Then, thou art, doubtless, His wife, the Lady Gycia. Good my lady, With such a presence to become a crown, We would you were at Bosphorus. Gycia. 'Tis clear Thou art a stranger here, or thou wouldst know That never would I leave my native city To win the crown of Rome. Lys. Madam, 'tis pity. Gycia. Sir, this is courtly talk. You came to see My husband; I will order that they send him At once to you. [Exit Gycia. Lys. That was indeed good fortune brought me hither When her lover knelt to her. I do not wonder That kneel he should, for she is beautiful As Helen's self. There comes some difference Between her and Asander, and 'twere strange If I might not so work on't as to widen The breach good fortune sends me, and to bind, Through that which I have seen, the boy her husband, To execute my will. Enter Asander. Asan. Lysimachus, I am rejoiced to see thee. Lys. Good my lord, How goes the world with thee? Thou art in mien Graver than thou wast once. Asan. I am ill at ease! I am ill at ease! How does the King my father? Lys. Alas! sir, he is ailing, and I fear Will never mend. Asan. Is he in present danger? Lys. Ay, that he is. A month or less from this May see the end. Asan. Keeps he his bed as yet? Lys. Nay, not yet, when I left him; but his mind Turns always to his absent son with longing, And sometimes, as it were 'twixt sleep and waking, I hear him say, ‚ÄúAsander, oh, my son! Shall I not see thee more?‚Äù Asan. Oh, my dear father! And dost thou love me thus, who have forgot thee These two long years? Belov√®d, lonely life! Belov√®d failing eyes! Lysimachus, I must go hence, and yet my honour binds me. O God, which shall I choose? They do forbid me‚Äî The ruler of this place and that good woman Who is my wife, but holds their curs√®d State More than my love‚Äîto go. Lys. My prince, I come To find a way by which thou mayst go free From that which binds thee fast. This festival To the dead Lamachus will give the occasion To set thee free. If thou dost doubt to break Thy word, yet doth a stronger, straiter chain Bind thee‚Äîthy oath. Thou hast not forgot thy oath To Bosphorus? Asan. Nay, I forget it not. But what is it thou wouldst of me? Lys. Asander, The night which ends the festival shall see us Masters of Cherson. Asan. Nay, but 'twere dishonour To set upon a friendly State from ambush‚Äî 'Twere murder, and not battle. Lys. Art thou false To thy own land and to thy dying father? Asan. That I am not; but never could I bear To play the midnight thief, and massacre Without announcement of legitimate war Whom daily I have known. My wife I love With all the love of my soul. If she seem cold When any word is spoken which may touch The safety of the State, think you she would love The husband who destroyed it? All my heart Is in her keeping. Lys. It is well indeed To have such faith. Doubtless the Lady Gycia Returns this pure affection. Asan. I would doubt The saints in heaven sooner than her truth, Which if I doubted, then the skies might fall, The bounds of right and wrong might be removed, The perjurer show truthful, and the wanton Chaste as the virgin, and the cold, pure saint More foolish than the prodigal who eats The husks of sense‚Äîit were all one to me; I could not trust in virtue. Lys. Thou art changed Since when thy ship set sail from Bosphorus; Thou didst not always think with such fond thought As now thou dost. Say, didst thou find thy bride Heart-whole as thou didst wish? Had she no lover Ere yet thou camest? Asan. Nay, nay; I found my wife Virgin in heart and soul. Lys. My Lord Asander, Art thou too credulous here? What if I saw her On that same spot, not half an hour ago, In tears, and kneeling at her feet a gallant Noble and comely as a morn in June, Who bade her break, with passionate words of love, Her hateful marriage vows, and make him blest Who must for ever love Asan. Thou sawest my wife Gycia, my pearl of women, my life, my treasure? Nay, nay, 'tis some sick dream! Thou art mistaken. Who knelt to her? Lys. She called him Theodorus. Asan. Irene's brother! Who was it who said He loved her without hope? Lysimachus, What is it that thou sawest? Come, 'tis a jest! Kneeling to Gycia, praying her to fly! Nay, nay, what folly is this? [Laughs. Lys. My lord, I swear It is no jest indeed, but solemn earnest. I saw him kneel to her; I heard the passion Burn through his voice. Asan. And she? What did my lady? She did repulse him sternly? Lys. Nay, indeed, She wept; was greatly moved, and whispered to him, ‚ÄúI am a wife.‚Äù Asan. Peace, peace! I will not hear Another word. How little do they know thee, My white, pure dove! My Lord Lysimachus, Some glamour has misled thee. Lys. Well, my lord, I should rejoice to think it, but I cannot Deny my eyes and ears. Is not this noble The brother of the lady who was once At Bosphorus at Court, and now attends The Lady Gycia? Asan. Ay, indeed he is. Lys. Well, she is near at hand; if thy belief Inclines not to my tale‚Äîwhich yet is true‚Äî Couldst thou not ask of her if ere your marriage Her brother was enamoured of your wife, And she of him? Asan. That might I do indeed. But, sooth to say, I would not speak again With her you name; and it may be indeed, I know her well, the Lady Gycia, Who is angered with her for what cause I know not, Might well resent the converse. Lys. Prince Asander, There is no man so blind as he who closes His eyes to the light and will not have it shine, As thou dost now. Asan. Then will I see this lady, Though knowing it is vain. [Exit Asander. Lys. I do not know What he will hear, but this at least I know: That woman loves him, and will lie to sow Dissension 'twixt these lovers‚Äîwhich accomplished, The rest is easy, and I hold this Cherson To make or mar at will. Ha! a good thought. I will send a message to the Lady Gycia Which shall ensure't. If she mislikes her friend, It is odds of ten to one some jealous humour Has caused it, or may grow of it. [Writes. ‚ÄúDear lady, Thou art wronged; the Prince Asander presently Is with Irene alone. Seek them, and wring Confession of their fault.‚Äù [Summons a Messenger. Ho there! convey These to the Lady Gycia, but stay not To tell her whence they come. Mess. I go, my lord. SCENE IV.‚ÄîIrene's prison. Irene; afterwards Asander and Gycia. Ire. To think that once I loved that haughty woman! Ah, that was long ago, before love came To tear our lives asunder. Though her power Can pen me here a prisoner, yet I know That I have pierced her heart. Oh, it is sweet To be revenged, and know that vengeance brings Victory in its train! If I had power To make Asander jealous of this wonder, Then all were easy. But I know no means Whereby from this strait prison I might sow Suspicion of her who has never given A shadow of cause. Attendant. The Lord Asander comes. Enter Asander. Asan. Lady, I grieve that thou art in this place, And fain would set thee free. Tell me what cause Has brought thee hither. Ire. Ask me not, my lord; I cannot tell thee. Asan. Nay, but know I must, To plead thy cause. Ire. 'Twas too great love of thee, The love which thou didst spurn, that brought me here. Asan. But how should that be so? Ire. The Lady Gycia, Holding thee to thy promise that thou wouldst not Go hence‚Äîno, not to close thy father's eyes‚Äî Took umbrage that I spoke with scant respect Of such unreasoning and unnatural bond As that which she approves. Asan. Then am I grateful For thy good-will, and grieve that it should bring thee To pine a prisoner here, and will essay What reason can to free thee. Ire. Thanks, my lord, I would that thou wert free. I knew the King, And did receive much fatherly affection From that most reverend man. I grieve to hear That he lies sick, and would rejoice to tend him As if I were a daughter. Asan. Gentle lady, No other voice of sympathy than thine Have I yet heard in Cherson, and I thank thee For thy good-will. Ire. 'Tis always thine, my lord, And more, though I should end my wretched days In prison for thy sake. Asan. I thank thee, lady, And fain would ask of thee a greater kindness: I would that thou wouldst tell me of thy brother. Ire. My brother Theodorus? What of him? Asan. This only. Did he, ere I knew my wife, Bear towards her a great though innocent love? Ire. A great though innocent love? Ay, a great love, For certain. Spoke she not of it to thee? Asan. No word! Ire. Ah! yet, maybe, 'twas innocent‚Äî Nay, I believe it, though she spoke not of it, And 'tis the wont of wives to laugh and boast Of innocent conquests. Asan. Nay, she spoke no word. Ire. And did no other of thy friends at Cherson Tell thee? Why, 'twas the talk of all the city How close they grew together, till thy coming And the necessities of Cherson turned Her eyes from him to thee. Asan. And does he still Bear love for her? Ire. And does he still bear love? Ay, passionate love. The heart which truly loves Puts not its love aside for ends of State, Or marriage bonds, or what the dullard law Suffers or does not suffer, but grows stronger For that which seeks to thwart it. Asan. And did she My wife return this love? Ire. Ay, so 'twas said. Ask me no more, I pray! Enter Gycia unperceived. Asan. Nay, by the love Thou bearest to me, speak! Gycia. My Lord Asander, What dost thou with this woman thus alone? Asan. 'Twere best thou didst not ask. Gycia. I have a right; I will be answered. First, thou didst deny Thou knewest aught of her; then said her nature Was such I might not call her friend, or live With her within four walls; and now, her fault‚Äî Which she herself proclaimed‚Äîpenning her here In a close prison, thou my husband comest To comfort her, 'twould seem‚Äîto travel o'er Again the old foul paths and secretly To gloat on the old passion. Asan. Nay, I came Not for this cause, but one which I will tell thee. I came to question of thy former love. Gycia. To question her of me? Asan. To know the cause That made my wife, scarce one short hour ago, Within my home, when hardly I had left her, Receive alone a lover kneeling to her With words of passionate love, and whisper to him, ‚ÄúI am a wife.‚Äù Gycia. Hast thou no shame, Asander, To speak such words to me before this woman, Who knows her brother's life? Ire. Nay, prithee, madam, Appeal not to me thus; I could say much On which I would keep silence. Gycia. Thou base woman, And thou poor dupe or most perfidious man, It were to honour ye to make defence Against a wanton and her paramour; But thee, Asander, never will I take To my heart again, till thou hast put from thee This lying accusation, and dost ask Pardon that thou hast dared with this base wretch To impugn my honour. Asan. Thou hast said no word Of answer to my charge; thy bold defiance Argues thy guilt. Gycia. My guilt? And canst thou dare To say this thing to me? I will speak no word; Denial were disgrace. Sir, I will have you Leave this place quickly. Asan. Madam, I obey you. [Exit. Gycia. And I too go. [Exit. Ire. I hold these hapless fools In the hollow of my hand. SCENE V.‚ÄîOutside the palace. Lysimachus and three Courtiers; afterwards Asander. Lys. My lords, what have you to report? Have the men arrived? 1st Court. For a week past they have been arriving at the rate of fifty a day. The ships anchor in due course. At dead of night, when everything is still, the merchandise is landed and conveyed well-disguised to the disused granaries adjoining Lamachus' palace, with good store of arms and provisions. 2nd Court. Yes, and by the day of the festival we shall have more than five hundred well-armed men within the walls, who, while the people are feasting, will bear down all opposing forces and open the gates to the larger body, who will lie concealed in the grain-ships in the harbour. Lys. Does no one suspect, think you, as yet? 1st Court. Not a soul. The stores are landed at midnight, and the place is haunted and full of noises. 3rd Court. Does the Prince know? Lys. Not yet, not a word. I can't trust him with his blind love for his wife. 3rd Court. What if he will not be of us? Lys. Then he shall be put under hatches at once for Bosphorus, and may take his wife with him if he pleases. 1st Court. But will he pardon the deed? Lys. The lad is a good lad enough, but weak as water. The world always pardons successful enterprises. Besides, I am in great hopes that he has so quarrelled with the ruler of Cherson, and may be, moreover, so out of conceit with his wife, that we can do as we will with him. 2nd Court. But be prudent, my Lord Lysimachus, I beg, for we know not how far he is with us, and if he is against us now, it may take more than we know to keep our heads on our shoulders. Lys. My lords, you shall not lose a drop of your blood. But here is my Lord Asander. He looks cast down enough, in all conscience. Enter Asander. Well, Prince, hast thou seen the lady? Asan. Speak not to me of her, I pray. I must leave this accursed place at once and for ever, and must take my wife with me. Once in Bosphorus, I may know again the happiness which is denied me here. I will not stay here a day. Is there any ship from Bosphorus in harbour? Get me away tonight secretly, and the Lady Gycia with me. Lys. My lord, there are many ships here from Bosphorus, but none empty or which can be spared now; but it wants but two days to the festival, and if thou wilt tarry until then, it may be we can so arrange that either thou mayst set sail for Bosphorus at will or bring Bosphorus hither at will. Asan. What do these words mean? You speak in riddles. I care not what becomes of me, but remember my honour, Lysimachus, my honour! If any scheme against the State of Cherson is in your mind, I will have none of it. I want nothing of these people, only to be allowed to turn my back upon them and their intrigues for ever, and to carry the wife whom I love far away from the air of chicane and base deceit which makes this Cherson a hell. Lys. My Lord Asander, thou hast not forgot Thy oath which thou didst swear ere first you left Our Bosphorus, that, come what fate should come, Thou wouldst not forget her. Now, as Fate would have it, These gentlemen and I, hearing report Of the grand festival which now approaches, Have ta'en such measures as may make our city Mistress of this her rival. Day by day Ships laden deep with merchandise cast anchor By Lamachus's palace, and unload At dead of night their tale of arm√®d men, And by to-morrow night, which is the eve Of the feast, five hundred men-at-arms or more In a dark hall, long empty and disused, These fools deem haunted, where the sounds they make Seem not of earth, and none draw near to hear, Will lie concealed. These, when the festival Has spent itself, and the drowsed citizens, Heavy with meat and wine, are fast asleep, Will issue forth at midnight and will seize The guardians of the gates, and throw them open To an o'erwhelming force which fills the ships Which lie within the harbour. For the rest, Cherson is ours, thou free to go or stay, King if thou wilt; but this, my lord, know well‚Äî Even if thou hast no reverence for thy oath, No power on earth can free thee from thy bonds Or speed thee hence, if still this curs√®d State Keeps its free power. Therefore, look well to it. Asan. I cannot do this thing. I am no thief Or midnight murderer, but a prince and soldier. Place me in open battle, and I care not For bloodshed; but this murderous intrigue, I will have none o't. Lys. Nay, my lord, in sooth, Why think of bloodshed? If our scheme go right (And nought can mar it now), what need of blood? These smooth knaves, though they fight behind their walls With cunning enginery, yet when they see Our army in their streets, will straight grow prudent And hug discretion. But, indeed, my lord, We have gone too far to pause, and if thou like not Our scheme, which makes for thee and for our State, We cannot risk that thou denounce our plan, And therefore, if thou wilt not join with us, The safety of ourselves and of the State Holds thee a prisoner pent in close duress Till victory is ours, and thou mayst take The fruit of others' daring, while thy wife Deserts her doubting and dishonoured lord For one who dares to act and play his part As a man should. Asan. (after hesitation). I do not hold with you, That a man's oath can bind him to his God To do what else were wrong. Yet, since you swear Your purpose is not bloodshed, and my will Is impotent to stay your choice, and chiefly Because I am cast down and sick at heart, And without any trust in God or man, I do consent to your conspiracy, Loving it not. Lys. There spoke my lord the Prince. We will succeed or die. Asan. I would sooner die. ACT IV. SCENE I.‚ÄîCherson. Irene's prison. Irene; then the Gaoler's Child; afterwards Gycia. Ire. Ah me! The heaviness of prisoned days! Heigho! 'Tis weary work in prison here. What though I know no loss but liberty, Have everything at will‚Äîfood, service, all That I should have, being free‚Äîyet doth constraint Poison life at its spring; and if I thought This woman's jealous humour would endure, I would sooner be a hireling set to tend The kine upon the plains, in heat or cold, Chilled through by the sharp east, scorched by the sun, So only I might wander as I would At my own will, than weary to be free From this luxurious cell. Hark! [The tramp of armed men is heard. What was that sound? I could swear I heard the measured tramp of men And ring of mail, yet is it but illusion. Last night I thought I heard it as I lay Awake at dead of night. Mere fantasy Born of long solitude, for here there are No soldiers nor mailed feet. [Again heard. Hark! once again. Nay, I must curb these fancies. Enter Child. Child. Gentle lady. Ire. Speak, little one. Come hither. Child. Gentle lady, My father, who is Warder of this tower, Bade me come hither and ask thee if thou wouldst That I should hold thy distaff, or might render Some other service. Ire. Ay, child; a good thought. Bring me my spinning-wheel. [Child brings it. Ire. (spinning). The light is fading fast, but would choose This twilight, if thou wilt not be afraid Of the darkness, little one. Child. Nay, that I am not, With one so good as thou. Ire. Nay, child, it may be I am not all thou think'st me. Child. But, dear lady, Are not all noble ladies good? Ire. Not all, Nor many, maybe. Child. To be sure they are not, Else were they not imprisoned. Ire. Little one, Not all who pine in prison are not good, Nor innocent who go free. Child. The Lady Gycia, Is she not good? Ire. It may be that she is. 'Tis a vile world, my child. Child. Nay, I am sure The Lady Gycia is as white and pure As are the angels. When my mother died She did commend me to her, and she promised To keep me always. Ire. But she sent me here. Child. Ah! lady, then I fear thou art not good. I am sorry for thee. Ire. So, my child, am I. [The tramp of armed feet is heard again. Child. Ah! lady, what is that? I am afraid. Didst hear the ghostly feet. Ire. What heardst thou, child? Child. A tramp of arm√®d men and ring of mail. Ire. Then, 'tis no fancy of my weary brain. If it comes again I must inquire into it. 'Tis passing strange. Be not afraid, my child. 'Twas but the wind which echoed through the void Of the vast storehouses below us. Come, [Spinning. Let us to spinning. Twirl and twirl and twirl; 'Tis a strange task. Child. Lady, I love it dearly. My mother span, and I would sit by her The livelong day. Ire. Didst ever hear the tale Of the Fates and how they spin? Child. I do not think so. Wilt tell me? Ire. There were three weird sisters once, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, Who spun the web of fate for each new life, Sometimes, as I do now, a brighter thread Woven with the dark, and sometimes black as night, Until at last came Atropos and cut The fine-worn life-thread thus. [Cuts the thread; the head of the spindle rolls away. Child. And hast thou cut Some life-thread now? Ire. My child, I am no Fate, And yet I know not; but the spindle's head Rolled hence to yonder corner. Let us seek it. Hast found it? Child. Nay, there is so little light, I think that it has fallen in the crevice Beneath yon panel. Ire. Stoop and seek it, child. Perchance the panel slides, and then, it may be, We shall let in the light. [Draws back the panel and discovers a bright light, files of armed men, and Asander in the midst. Child. Ay, there it is; We have it, we have found it. [Sliding panel back again. Ire. What have we found? What have we found? Yes, little one, 'tis found! Run away now‚ÄîI fain would be alone‚Äî And come back presently. [Kisses Child, who goes. These were the sounds I heard and thought were fancy's. All is clear As is the blaze of noon. The Prince Asander Is traitor to the State, and will o'er-whelm it When all the citizens are sunk in sleep After to-morrow's feast. Well, what care I? He is not for me, whether we call him King Or Archon; and for these good men of Cherson, What is their fate to me? If he succeed, As now he must, since no one knows the secret, 'Twill only be a change of name‚Äîno more. The King and Queen will hold a statelier Court And live contented when the thing is done, And that is all. For who will call it treason When victory crowns the plot? But stay! a gleam Of new-born hope. What, what if it should fail As I could make it fail? What if this woman, Full of fantastic reverence for the dead, And nourished on her cold republican dream, Should learn the treason ere 'twas done and mar it? Would not Asander hate her for the failure? And she him for the plot? I know her well, I know her love for him, but well I know She is so proud of her Athenian blood And of this old republic, she would banish Her love for less than this. Once separated, The Prince safe over seas in Bosphorus, His former love turned to injurious pride, I might prevail! I would! Re-enter Child. Nay, little one, We will spin no more to-day. I prithee go And seek the Lady Gycia. Say to her, By all the memory of our former love I pray that she will come to me at once. Lose not a moment. [Exit Child. Hark! the tramp again; Again the ring of mail. I wonder much If she shall hear it first, or first the eye Shall slay her love within her. Enter Gycia. Gycia. Thou dost ask My presence; wherefore is it? Ire. Gycia, Thou dost not love me, yet would I requite Thy wrong with kindness. That thy love was false To thee, thou knowest, but it may be still There is a deeper falsehood than to thee, And thou shalt know it. Dost thou hear that sound? [The tramp of men again heard. What means it, think you? Gycia. Nay, I cannot tell. 'Tis like the tramp of arm√®d men. Ire. It is; And who are they? Gycia. Young citizens of Cherson, Maybe, rehearsing for to-morrow's pageant And the procession. [Going. Ire. Stay, thou stubborn woman, Canst bear to see, though the sight blight thy life? Gycia. I know not what thou wouldst, but I can bear it. Ire. Though it prove thy love a traitor? Gycia. That it will not! Ire. Then, make no sound, but see what I will show thee. Look now! Behold thy love! [Draws back panel, and discovers Asander with the soldiers of Bosphorus standing in line. Asander's voice heard. Asan. At stroke of midnight To-morrow night be ready. Soldiers. Any, my lord. [Gycia tottering back. Irene slides back the panel, and Gycia sets her back against it, half fainting; Irene regarding her with triumph. Gycia. Was that my husband? and those men around him Soldiers of Bosphorus, to whom he gave Some swift command? What means it all, ye saints? What means it? This the husband of my love, Upon whose breast I have lain night by night For two sweet years‚Äîmy husband whom my father Loved as a son, whose every thought I knew, Or deemed I did, lurking in ambush here Upon the eve of our great festival, Scheming some bloody treachery to take Our Cherson in the toils? Oh, 'tis too much; I cannot trust my senses! 'Twas a dream! Ire. No dream, but dreadful truth! Gycia. Thou cruel woman, How have I harmed thee, thou shouldst hate me thus? But 'twas no dream. Why was it else that he, But for some hateful treachery, devised This festival? Why was it that he grew So anxious to go hence and take me with him, But that guilt made him coward, and he feared To see his work? Oh, love for ever lost, And with it faith gone out! what is't remains But duty, though the path be rough and trod By bruised and bleeding feet? Oh, what is it Is left for me in life but death alone, Which ends it? Ire. Gycia, duty bids the banish Thy love to his own State, and then disclose The plot thou hast discovered. It may be That thou mayst join him yet, and yet grow happy. Gycia. Never! For duty treads another path Than that thou knowest. I am my father's daughter. It is not mine to pardon or condemn; That is the State's alone. 'Tis for the State To banish, not for me, and therefore surely I must denounce these traitors to the Senate, And leave the judgment theirs. Ire. (kneeling). Nay, nay, I pray thee, Do not this thing! Thou dost not know how cruel Is State-craft, or what cold and stony hearts Freeze in their politic breasts. Gycia. Thou kneel'st to me To spare my husband! Think'st thou I love him less Than thou dost, wanton? Ire. Gycia, they will kill him. Get him away to-night to Bosphorus. Thou dost not know these men! Gycia. I know them not? I who have lived in Cherson all my days, And trust the State? Nay, I will get me hence, And will denounce this treason to the Senate. There lies my duty clear, and I will do it; I fear not for the rest. The State is clement To vanquished foes, and doubtless will find means To send them hence in safety. For myself I know not what may come‚Äîa broken heart, Maybe, and death to mend it. But for thee, Thou shameless wanton, if thou breathe a sound Or make a sign to them, thou diest to-night With torture. Ire. Spare him! Do not this thing, Gycia! [Exit Gycia. O God, she is gone! he is lost! and I undone! [Swoons. Scene II.‚ÄîRoom in Lamachus's palace. Lysimachus, Megacles, Courtiers; afterwards Asander. Lys. Well, good Megacles, I hope you are prepared to carry out your function. It will be a busy and anxious day to-morrow, no doubt, and most of us will be glad when midnight strikes. Meg. My Lord Lysimachus, I hope so. I have not closed an eye for the last two nights. As to the Procession, I flatter myself that no better-arranged pomp has ever defiled before C√¶sar's Palace. It will be long, it will be splendid, it will be properly marshalled. There is no other man in the Empire who knows the distinctions of rank or the mysteries of marshalling better than I do. Look at the books I have studied. There is the treatise of the Learned and Respectable Symmachus on Processions. That is one. There is the late divine Emperor Theodosius on Dignities and Titles of Honour. That is two. There is our Learned and Illustrious Chamberlain Procopius's treatise on the office and duties of a Count of the Palace. That, as no doubt you know, is in six large volumes. That is three, or, nay, eight volumes. Oh, my poor head! And I have said nothing of the authorities on Costume‚Äîa library, I assure you, in themselves. Yes, it has been an anxious time, but a very happy one. I wish our young friends here would devote a little more time to such serious topics, and less to such frivolities as fighting and making love. The latter is a fine art, no doubt, and, when done according to rule, is well enough; but as for fighting, getting oneself grimed with dust and sweat, and very likely some vulgar churl's common blood to boot‚Äîpah! it is intolerable to think of it. 1st Court. Ah! good Megacles, I am afraid that the world cannot spare its soldiers yet for many years to come. So long as there is evil in the world, and lust of power and savagery and barbarism, so long, depend upon it, there is room and need for the soldier. Meg. Certainly, my lord, certainly; and besides, they are very highly decorative too. Nothing looks better to my mind at a banquet than bright gay faces and lithe young figures set in a shining framework of mail. By the way, my Lord Lysimachus, it was kind of you to provide our procession with a strong detachment of fine young soldiers from Bosphorus. I have secured a prominent place for them, and the effect will be perfect. I trust the Lady Melissa will like it. Lys. My lord, you are mistaken; there are no soldiers from Bosphorus here. Meg. But I was with the Prince last night, and saw them. Lys. I tell you you are mistaken. There are none here. Do you understand me? There are none here. 2nd Court. Nay, indeed, my Lord Megacles. We were trying, with a view to the pageant, how a number of young men of Cherson would look in the array of Bosphorus; but we gave it up, since we feared that they would bear them so clumsily that they would mar the whole effect. Meg. Ah, that explains it; quite right, quite right. Well, I see I was mistaken. But I wish I could have had soldiers from Bosphorus. They are the one thing wanting to make to-morrow a perfect success, as the Lady Melissa said. Lys. They are indeed, as you say. But, my Lord Megacles, pray do not whisper abroad what you have said here; these people are so jealous. They would grow sullen, and spoil the pageant altogether. Meg. Ah, my lord, you have a good head. I will not breathe a word of it till the day is done. Lys. Thanks, my lord, and as I know you will be weary with the long day's work and your great anxieties, I am going to lay a little friendly compulsion upon you. You must leave the banquet to-morrow and go to rest by eleven o'clock at latest. Meg. Well, my lord, I am not so young as I was, and if I have your permission to leave before all is over, well and good. No one knows what an anxious day is before me, and I have no doubt I shall have earned my night's rest by then. But I have much yet to do, so with your permission I will wish you good night. [Exit Megacles, bowing low to each with exaggerated gestures. Lys. Poor soul, poor soul! If any fight comes, it would be as cruel to let him take his part with men as it would be if he were a woman or a child. Enter Asander. Welcome, my Lord Asander. Hast thou seen our men, and are they ready for to-morrow? Asan. I have just come from them, and they are ready, But I am not. I pray you, let this be; Send back these men to-night. I am oppressed By such o'ermastering presages of ill As baffle all resolve. Lys. My Lord Asander, It is too late. Wouldst thou, then, break thy oath? Wouldst thou live here a prisoner, nor behold Thy father, though he die? Wouldst thou thy country Should spurn thee as the traitor whose malignance Blighted her hard-won gains? It is too late! It is too late! Asan. I am grown infirm of will As any dotard. I will go on now So that thou dost no murder. Lys. Why was it We came in such o'erwhelming force, but that We sought to shed no blood? Asan. I will be ready, Though with a heavy heart. To-morrow night At stroke of twelve, when all the feast is done, And all asleep, we issue from the palace, Seize the guards at their posts, and open wide The gates to the strong force which from the ships At the same hour shall land. The citizens, Heavy with wine, will wake to find their city Our own beyond recall. Lys. Ay, that's the scheme, And nought can mar it now. Good night, my lord. Sleep well; there is much to do. Asan. Good night, my lords! [Exit Asander. Lys. No bloodshed! Why, what fools love makes of men! I have seen this very lad dash through the ranks Of hostile spearmen, cut and hack and thrust As in sheer sport. There will be blood shed, surely, Unless these dogs have lost their knack of war As he has; but we have them unprepared, And shall prevail, and thou shalt be avenged, My father slain, and thou, my murdered brother, Shalt be avenged! My lords, you know what work Is given each to do. Be not too chary Of your men's swords; let them strike sudden terror. Slay all who do resist, or if they do not, Yet slay them still. My lords, give you good night. To-morrow at midnight, at the stroke of twelve‚Äî At the stroke of twelve! [Exeunt omnes. SCENE III.‚ÄîThe council chamber of the Senate of Cherson. Zetho and Senators; afterwards Gycia. Zet. Most worthy brethren, Senators of Cherson, In great perplexity of mind and will I summon ye to-night. The Lady Gycia, Our Lamachus's daughter, sends request, Urgent as 'twere of instant life and death, That I should call yet here. What care can move Such anxious thought in her, on this the eve Of the high festival herself has founded, I know not, but 'twould seem the very air Is full of floating rumours, vague alarms, Formless suspicions which elude the grasp, Unspoken presages of coming ill Which take no shape. For whence should danger come? We are at peace with all. Our former foe Is now our dearest friend; the Prince Asander, Though of a hasty spirit and high temper, Dwells in such close, concordant har mony With his loved wife that he is wholly ours; And yet though thus at peace, rumours of war And darkling plots beset us. Is it not thus? Have ye heard aught? 1st Sen. Zetho, 'tis true. Last night, a citizen Sware he heard clang of arms and ring of mail At midnight by the house of Lamachus! 2nd Sen. My freedman, coming home at grey of dawn, Saw a strange ship unload her merchandise, And one bale chanced to fall, and from it came Groanings and drops of blood! 3rd Sen. Two nights ago, The ways being white with snow, I on the quay Saw the thick-planted marks of arm√®d feet; But, rising with the dawn, I found the place Swept clean with care! Zet. Brethren, I know not what These things portend. Enter Gycia. But see, she comes! Good daughter, Why is thy cheek so pale? Gycia. This is the wont Of women. Grief drives every drop of blood Back to the breaking heart, which love calls forth To mantle on the cheek. Sirs, I have come On such an errand as might drive a woman Stronger than I to madness; I have come To tell you such a tale as well might fetter My tongue and leave me speechless. Pity me If I do somewhat wander in my talk! 'Tis scarce an hour ago, that in my house, Drawing some secret panel in the wall, I saw the long hall filled with arm√®d men Of Bosphorus, and at their head‚ÄîO Heaven, I cannot say it!‚Äîat their head I saw My husband, my Asander, my own love, [Senators rise with strong emotion. Who ordered them and bade them all stand ready To-morrow night at midnight. What means this? What else than that these traitorous bands shall slay Our Cherson's liberties, and give to murder Our unsuspecting people, whom the feast Leaves unprepared for war? I pray you, sirs, Lose not one moment. Call the citizens To arms while yet 'tis time! Defeat this plot! Do justice on these traitors! Save the city, Though I am lost! Zet. Daughter, thy loyal love To our dear city calls for grateful honour From us who rule. In thy young veins the blood Of patriot Lamachus flows to-day as strong As once it did in his; nay, the warm tide Which stirred the lips of bold Demosthenes And all that dauntless band who of old time Gave heart and life for Athens, still is thine In our Hellenic story, there is none Who has done more than thou, who hast placed love, Wedlock, and queenly rule, and all things dear To a tender woman's heart, below the State‚Äî A patriot before all. Is there no favour A State preserved may grant thee? Gycia. Noble Zetho, I ask but this. I know my husband's heart, How true it was and loyal. He is led, I swear, by evil counsels to this crime: And maybe, though I seek not to excuse him, It was the son's love for his dying sire, Whom he should see no more, that scheming men Have worked on to his ruin. Banish him To his own city, though it break my heart, But harm him not; and for those wretched men Whose duty 'tis to obey, shed not their blood, But let the vengeance of our city fall Upon the guilty only. Zet. Brethren all, Ye hear what 'tis she asks, and though to grant it Is difficult indeed, yet her petition Comes from the saviour of the State. I think We well may grant her prayer. Though well I know How great the danger, yet do I believe It may be done. Is it so, worthy brethren? [Senators nod assent. Daughter, thy prayer is granted. Gycia. Sirs, I thank you; I love you for your mercy. Zet. For the rest, I counsel that we do not rouse the city. 'Twere of no use to-night to set our arms, Blunt with long peace and rusted with disuse, Against these banded levies. By tomorrow‚Äî And we are safe till then‚Äîwe shall have time To league together such o'erwhelming force As may make bloodshed needless, vain their plot, And mercy possible. Meantime, dear lady, Breathe not a word of what thine eyes have seen, But bear thyself as though thou hadst seen nothing, And had no care excepting to do honour To thy dead sire; and when the weary day Tends to its close, school thou thy heavy heart, And wear what mask of joy thou canst, and sit Smiling beside thy lord at the high feast, Where all will meet. See that his cup is filled To the brim; drink healths to Bosphorus and Cherson. Seem thou to drink thyself, having a goblet Of such a colour as makes water blush Rosy as wine. When all the strangers' eyes Grow heavy, then, some half an hour or more From midnight, rise as if to go to rest, Bid all good night, and thank them for their presence. Then, issuing from the banquet-hall, lock fast The great doors after thee, and bring the key To us, who here await thee. Thus shalt thou Save this thy State, and him thy love, and all. For we will, ere the fateful midnight comes, Send such o'erwhelming forces to surround them That they must needs surrender, and ere dawn Shall be long leagues away. We will not shed A drop of blood, my daughter. Gycia. Noble Zetho, I thank you and these worthy senators. I knew you would be merciful. I thank you, And will obey in all things. [Exit Gycia. Bardanes, 1st Sen. She is gone; I durst not speak before her. Dost thou know, Good Zetho, how infirm for war our State After long peace has grown? I doubt if all The men whom we might arm before the hour Are matched in numbers with those murderous hordes; While in experience of arms, in training, In everything that makes a soldier strong, We are no match for them. Our paramount duty Is to the State alone, not to these pirates Who lie in wait to slay us; nor to one Who, woman-like, knows not our strength or weakness, Nor cares, if only she might wring a promise To spare her traitorous love. But we have arts Which these barbarians know not, quenchless fires Which in one moment can enwrap their stronghold In one red ring of ruin. My counsel is, That ere the hour of midnight comes we place Around the palace walls on every side Such store of fuel and oils and cunning drugs As at one sign may leap a wall of fire Impassable, and burn these hateful traitors Like hornets in their nest. Zetho. Good brethren all, Is this your will? Is it faith? Is it honour, think you, To one who has given all, for us to break Our solemn plighted word? 2nd Sen. We will not break it; We shed no drop of blood. The State demands it; The safety of the State doth override All other claim. The safety of the State Is more than all! All the Senators, with uplifted arms. Ay, Zetho, more than all! Zetho. Then, be it as you will. See, therefore, to it; Take measures that your will be done, not mine. Though I approve not, yet I may not set My will against the universal voice. Save us our Cherson. For the rest I care not, Only I grieve to break our solemn promise To Lamachus's child. Poor heart! poor heart! ACT V. SCENE I.‚ÄîOutside Lamachus's palace. Megacles, Lysimachus, Courtiers, and Citizens of Cherson. Meg. Oh, this has been a happy day. All has gone admirably. Not a hitch in all the arrangements. Precedence kept, rank observed, dresses all they should be. I do not, I really do not think, though I say it who should not, that the Imperial Chamberlain at Constantinople could have conducted the matter better. 1st Court. Nay, that he could not, good Megacles. Let us hope that what remains to do will go as smoothly. Meg. What remains? Doubtless you mean the banquet. That is all arranged long ago under three heads. First, the order of entering the hall; second, the order of the seats; third, the order of going forth. Lys. Doubtless the last will arrange itself. Remember, the only order of going to be observed is this, that thou get thyself gone, and all the guests from Cherson gone, fully half an hour before midnight. Meg. But, my lord, that is impossible; you ask too much. How long do you suppose it will take, at a moderate computation, to get one hundred men of ill-defined rank out of a room with a decent regard for Precedence. Why, I have seen it take an hour at the Palace, where everybody knew his place, and here I cannot undertake to do it under two. Lys. My friend, you will get it done; you will waive ceremony. None but the Prince and ourselves must remain within half an hour of midnight, and the hall must be cleared. Meg. Ah, well, my Lord Lysimachus, the responsibility rests with you; I will have none of it. It is as much as my reputation is worth. But if I do this cannot you let me have a guard of honour of armed men to stand at intervals along the hall. I have been longing for them all day. Lys. (angrily.) Peace, fool! I have told you before we have no soldiers here. [People of Cherson overhearing him. 1st Cit. Didst hear that old man? He believes there are soldiers here. Whence do they come? and why did the other check him? Meg. Well, my Lord Lysimachus, if not soldiers, men-at-arms, and these there certainly are, and highly decorative too. 2nd Cit. I hate these Bosphorians. What if the rumour should be true? Pass the word to the citizens that they sleep not to-night, but keep their arms ready for what may come. We are a match for them, whatever may be their design. To-morrow we will probe this matter to its depths. 2nd Court. Depend upon it, there is no time to lose if we would forestall these fellows. But here comes the procession to the banqueting-hall. [Citizens going to banquet two and two. Meg. (with a gold wand.). This way, gentlemen; this way, masters and mistresses; this way, Respectables! [Accompanies them to the end of the stage towards the banqueting-hall in the distance. Returns to escort another party. Musicians, etc. Enter Senators, two and two. Meg. (bowing profoundly three times). Most Illustrious Senators! this way, your Highnesses; this way. Enter Melissa and other Ladies. (To Melissa) Fairest and loveliest of your adorable sex, your slave prostrates himself before your stainless and beatific feet (Bowing low and kissing his fingers). Illustrious Ladies, I pray you to advance. Lys. (with Courtiers standing apart). A good appetite, my friends. Enjoy yourselves while you may. Bard. We are quite ready, my Lord Lysimachus. Are you not (with a sneer) for the banquet? Lys. In good time, in good time. If they only knew. [Aside. Bard. (overhearing.) If you knew all, my friends. Meg. (returning). I pray you, most Illustrious Senators, to excuse the absence of a guard of honour. Bard. Nay, nay; we are peaceful people, and have no armed men nearer than Bosphorus, as my Lord Lysimachus knows. There are plenty in that favoured State, no doubt. Lys. (confused). What does this insolence mean? I would the hour were come. Enter Zetho, with his retinue. Meg. Your Gravity, Your Sincerity, Your Sublime and Wonderful Magnitude, Your Illustrious and Magnificent Highness, I prostrate myself before Your Altitude. Will You deign to walk this way? Zetho. My lord, I am no C√¶sar, but a simple citizen of Cherson, called by my fellows to preside over the State. Use not to me these terms, I pray of you, but lead on quickly. Meg. I prostrate myself before Your Eminence. Enter Asander and Gycia. Meg. (returning). Noble Prince, will your Illustrious Consort and yourself deign to follow me? Asan. Nay, good Megacles, will you and these gentlemen go first, I have a word to say to the Lady Gycia. We will be with you before the guests are seated. Meg. I obey, my Lord Asander, and will await you at the door. [Megacles, Lysimachus, and the rest, pass on. Asan. Gycia, though we have passed from amity And all our former love, yet would I pray you, By our sweet years of wedded happiness, Give ear to me a moment. It may be That some great shock may come to set our lives For evermore apart. Gycia. Ah yes, Asander‚Äî For evermore apart! Asan. And I would fain, If it must be, that thou shouldst know to-night That never any woman on the earth Held me one moment in the toils of love Except my wife. Gycia. What! not Irene's self? Asan. Never, I swear by Heaven. She was a woman In whom a hopeless passion burnt the springs Of maiden modesty. I never gave her The solace of a smile. Gycia. Dost thou say this? Is thy soul free from all offence with her, If thou camest now to judgment? Asan. Ay, indeed, Free as a child's. Gycia. Oh, my own love! my dear! Ah no! too late, too late! [Embraces him. Asan. I ask thee not Counter assurance, since I know thy truth. Gycia. Speaks thou of Theodorus? He loved me Before I knew thee, but I loved no man Before I met Asander. When he knelt That day, it was in pity for my grief, Thinking thee false, and all his buried love Burst into passionate words, which on the instant I as thy wife repelled. Asan. Oh, perfect woman! [They embrace. O God, it is too late! Come, let us go; The guests are waiting for us. What can Fate Devise to vanquish Love. [Exeunt. Enter two drunken Labourers of Cherson, bearing faggots and straw. 1st Lab. Well, friend, what kind of day has it been with you? 2nd Lab. Oh, a white day, a happy day! Plenty of food, plenty of wine, raree shows without end, such processions as were never seen‚Äîthe very model of a democracy; nothing to pay, and everybody made happy at the expense of the State. I have lived in Cherson, man and boy, for fifty years, and I never saw anything to compare with it. Here's good luck to Lamachus's memory, say I, and I should like to celebrate his lamented decease as often as his daughter likes. 1st Lab. Didst know him, citizen? 2nd Lab. No, not I. He has been dead these two years. Time he was forgotten, I should think. They don't commemorate poor folk with all these fal-lals and follies. 1st Lab. Well, citizen, there is one comfort‚Äîthe great people don't enjoy themselves as we do. Did you ever see such a set of melancholy, frowning, anxious faces as the grandees carried with them to-day? And as for the Prince and the Lady Gycia, I don't believe they spoke a word the livelong day, though they walked together. That is the way with these grandees. When you and I quarrel with our wives, it is hammer and tongs for five minutes, and then kiss and make friends. 2nd Lab. And fancy being drilled by that old fool from Bosphorus‚Äî‚ÄúMost Illustrious, this is your proper place;‚Äù ‚ÄúRespectable sir, get you back there‚Äù (mimics Megacles), and so forth. 1st Lab. Well, well, it is good to be content. But I warrant we are the only two unhappy creatures in Cherson to-night, who have the ill fortune to be sober. And such wine too, and nothing to pay! 2nd Lab. Never mind, citizen, we shall be paid in meal or malt, I dare say, and we are bound to keep sober. By the way, it is a curiously contrived bonfire this. 1st Lab. It will be the crowning triumph of the whole festival, the senator said. 2nd Lab. But who ever heard of a bonfire on a large scale like this, so close to an old building? You know our orders: we are to place lines of faggots and straw close to the building on every side, well soaked with oil, and certain sealed vessels full of a secret compound in the midst of them. And just before midnight we are to run with torches and set light to the whole bonfire, to amuse the noble guests at the banquet. [Irene at a window, overhearing. 1st Lab. Ah! do you not see? It is a device of the Senate to startle our friends from Bosphorus. The faggots and straw blaze up fiercely round the wall; then, when all is confusion, the substance in the sealed vessels escapes and at once puts out the fire, and the laugh is with us. Our friends from Bosphorus know what we can do in chemistry before now. 2nd Lab. Faith, a right merry device! Ha! ha! What a head thou hast, citizen! Well, we must go on with our work. Lay the faggots evenly. Ire. (at the window above). Great God! what is this? We are doomed to die! Good friends, Know you my brother, the Lord Theodorus? I have something urgent I would say to him. I will write it down, and you shall give it him When he comes forth from the banquet. [Disappears. 1st Lab. Good my lady. Her brother, too, she calls him. I go bail it is her lover, and this is an assignation. Well, well, we poor men must not be too particular. 2nd Lab. No, indeed; but let us get on with our work, or we shall never finish in time. Ire. (reappearing). Here it is. Give it him, I pray, when he comes forth. 'Tis a thing of life and death. 1st Lab. So they all think, Poor love-sick fools! Ire. See, here is gold for you‚Äî 'Tis all I have; but he will treble it, If you fail not. 1st Lab. Lady, we shall be here, We must be here. Fear not, we shall not miss him. SCENE II.‚ÄîThe banquet hall. At a table, on a dais, Zetho, Asander, Gycia, and Senators; Lysimachus, and Courtiers of Bosphorus. Magnates of Cherson at cross tables. Asander, Lysimachus, the Courtiers, and Senators Seem flushed with wine. Zetho. I drink to him whose gracious memory We celebrate to-day. In all our Cherson, Which boasts descent from the Athenian race, Who one time swayed the world, there was no man, Nor ever had been, fired with deeper love Of this our city, or more heartfelt pride In our republican rule (Lysimachus sneers), which freeborn men Prize more than life. I do not seek to bind Those who, long nurtured under kingly rule, Give to the Man the love we bear the State; But never shall the name of King be heard In this our Cherson. Lys. Archon, 'twere unwise To risk long prophecies. Bard. Be silent, sir, If you would not offend. Zetho, I bid you all Drink to the memory of Lamachus And weal to our Republic. Lys. Shall we drink Its memory, for it has not long to live, If it be still alive? Bard. It will outlive thee. Thou hast not long to live. Lys. Longer than thou, If swords be sharp. Zetho. I pray you, gentlemen, Bandy not angry words. Gycia. My Lord Asander, Thy cup is empty. Shall I fill it for thee? Thou lovedst Lamachus? Asan. Ay, that I did; And I love thee. But I have drunk enough. I must keep cool to-night. Gycia. Nay; see, I fill My glass to drink with thee. Asan. Well, well, I drink, But not to the Republic. Gycia. Ah! my lord, There is a gulf still yawns 'twixt thee and me Which not the rapture of recovered love Can ever wholly bridge. To my dead father I drink, and the Republic! Lys. Which is dead. Bard. Nay, sir, but living, and shall live when thou Liest rotting with thy schemes. Enter Megacles. Meg. My Lord Asander, A messenger from Bosphorus, just landed, Has bid me give thee this. [Gives Asander letter. Asan. (reading) ‚ÄúMy Lord, the King Is dead, asking for thee.‚Äù Oh, wretched day! Had I but gone to him, and left this place Of sorrow ere he died! Gycia. My love, my dear! Thou wilt go hence too late. I would indeed The law had let thee go. Sorrow like this Draws parted lives in one, and knits anew The rents which time has made. Lys. The King is dead! Ay, then long live the King of Bosphorus! And more ere long! Bard. Think you that he will live To wear his crown? Zetho. Brethren, the hour is late, And draws to midnight, and 'tis time that all Should rest for whom rest is. (To Bardanes aside) We must consider What change of policy this weighty change Which makes Asander King may work in us. Bard. (aside). Nay, nay, no change! He is a murderer still, And shall be punished were he thrice a king. Asan. Good night to all. And thou, good Megacles, Thou wert my father's servant, take thy rest. Go hence with these. Meg. I have no heart to marshal These dignitaries forth. My King is dead; I am growing old and spent. Zetho. Daughter, remember Thy duty to the State. Gycia. I will, good Zetho. I am my father's daughter. Gentle Sirs And Ladies all, good night. [Exeunt omnes except Asander and Gycia; Lysimachus and Courtiers by one door, then the Chersonites by another opposite. Asan. Dearest of women, How well this fair head will become a crown! I know not how it is, but now this blow Has fallen, it does not move me as I thought. I am as those who come in tottering age Even to life's verge, whom loss of friend or child Touches not deeply, since the dead they love Precede them but a stage upon the road Which they shall tread to-morrow. Yet am I Young, and thou too, my Gycia; we should walk The path of life together many years, But that some strange foreboding troubles me. For oh, my dear! now that the sun of love Beams on our days again, my worthless life Grows precious, and I tremble like a coward At dangers I despised. Tell me, my Gycia, Though I am true in love, wouldst thou forgive me If I were false or seemed false to thy State? Hast thou no word for me? May I not tell thee My secret, which so soon all men shall know, And ask thy pardon for it? Gycia. Say on, Asander. Asan. Know, then, that soldiers sent from Bosphorus Have long time hid within our palace here‚Äî Long time before I knew, or I had nipt The treason in the bud; and in an hour Or less from when we speak, they will go forth, When all the citizens are wrapt in sleep After the toilsome day, and seize the gates, And open to the army which lies hid On board the ships without. They will not shed The blood of any, since the o'erwhelming force Will make resistance vain. I never liked The plot, I swear to thee; but, all being done, And I a subject, dared not disavow That which was done without me. But I have forced A promise that no blood be spilt. Gycia. Asander, I have known it all, and have discovered all [Asander starts. The secret to the Senate! But I knew not, Save by the faith that is the twin with love, That thou didst follow only in this plot, And wert unwilling; and I do rejoice Thy hands are free from blood. But oh, my love, Break from these hateful men! Thou art now a King, Thou canst command. Come, let us fly together; There yet is time! I tell thee that this plot Is doomed to ruin. Ere the morning dawns, All but the guilty leaders will be sent Prisoners to Bosphorus, and thou with them. I have gained this on my knees; but for the guilty The State has punishments. Asan. Gycia, thou wouldst not That I should break my faith? 'Tis a King's part To keep faith, though he die. But when they have seized The city, then, using my kingly office, I will undo the deed, and make alliance With Cherson, and this done I will depart, Taking my Queen with me. Gycia. Then must I go; I cannot live without thee. Asan. Now to rest, If not to sleep. Gycia. Good night, my love; farewell. Asan. Nay, not farewell, my love! Gycia. Ah yes, farewell! Farewell! farewell for ever! [Exeunt. SCENE III.‚ÄîOutside the banquet hall. Darkness. Gycia hurriedly descends the steps, closing the great doors of the banquet hall softly. Gycia. I hear no sound within; the lights are gone, And all the hall is dark. These doors alone Of all the many outlets of the palace Remain unlocked. There is not now a moment To lose ere midnight comes, and here I hold The safety of our Cherson. Oh, my love! I could not tell thee all, nor recompense Thy faith in me, since duty held me fast‚Äî My duty which should also prove thy safety, For now the solemn promise of the State Is pledged to hold thee harmless, and defeat The shameful plot I knew was never thine, Without one drop of bloodshed. All my path Shows clear as noonday, and I save our city And those who with thee err in innocence. Why do I hesitate? Yet does some dark And dreadful presage of impending ill So haunt me that I know not how to face it. I dare not do it. I must stay with him, Or bring him forth with me. [Ascends the steps, throws open the doors, and finds all darkness and silence. Asander! husband! It is thy wife who calls! Come forth, Asander! [Listens. Nay, there is no one there. I cannot stay; This is mere folly. I must keep my word; There's not a moment's time, or all is lost. Which is the key? [Closes the doors and locks them with a clang. I must go forth alone To the Senate-chamber. I have saved our Cherson And my Asander! [Totters down the steps and exit hurriedly. SCENE IV.‚ÄîThe Senate-chamber. Zetho and Senators; afterwards Gycia. Zetho. What is the hour? Bardanes. It wants five minutes only To midnight. Think you she will come? Zetho. I know her. She is the soul of honour, and would keep Her word if 'twere her death. Bard. But would she keep it If 'twere her lover's? Zetho. She thinks not that it is, Nor should it be, indeed, were we but true As I believe her. Bard. True! There is no truth In keeping faith with murderers; they must perish In the same net which they laid privily Against a faithful city. Enter Gycia, tottering in, with the keys. Zetho. Hail, noble daughter! Thou hast saved the State. I knew thou wouldst not fail us. Gycia. See, good Zetho, The proof that I have done my part to you. There are the master keys of all the doors Within the palace. When I closed the last, A few brief minutes since, there was no sound Nor light in hall or chamber; every court Was silent as the grave. Bard. Ay, as the grave It is, or will be soon. Gycia. What mean you, sir, I pray you? I am but a timid woman, Full of foreboding fears and dread of ill, And such a doubt doth overspread my soul, Hearing thy words, I think I shall go mad. Nay, Zetho, he is safe; I have your promise Thou wouldst not harm him. An o'erwhelming force, Thou saidst, should so surround them that resistance Were vain, and ere the dawn they should go hence Without one drop of bloodshed. Zetho. Ay, my daughter, Such was the promise. Bard. And it will be kept. [Bell strikes midnight. Hark, 'tis the hour! An overwhelming force [A red glare rising higher and higher is seen through the windows of the Senate-chamber. Confused noises and shouts heard without. Surrounds them, but no drop of blood is shed. All will go hence ere dawn. Gycia. Oh, cruel man, And most perfidious world! Oh, my Asander! To die thus and through me! [A violent knocking is heard at the door. Enter Theodorus in great agitation, and Irene, who throws herself on her knees, weeping. Gycia falls swooning in Zetho's arms. Zetho. Whence com'st thou, Theodorus? Theo. Straight, my lord, From Gycia's palace. Zetho. Say, what didst thou there? And what of horror has befallen thee That makes thine eyes stare thus? Theo. Most noble Zetho, When from the banquet scarce an hour ago I passed, came one who offered me a letter And bade me read. 'Twas from this woman here, My sister, and it told of some great peril By fire, which she, within the prison locked, Expected with the night. Wherefore I sped With one I trusted, and did set a ladder Against her casement, calling her by name, And bidding her descend. But no voice came, And all was dark and silent as the grave; And when I called again, the Prince Asander, From an adjacent casement looking, cried, ‚ÄúI had forgot thy sister. Take her hence; She should go free!‚Äù And then, at her own casement [Gycia revives and listens. Appearing, he came forth, and in his arms A woman's senseless form. As they descended And now were in mid-air, there came the sound Of the bell striking midnight, and forthwith In a moment, like a serpent winged with fire, There rose from wall to wall a sheet of flame, Which in one instant mounted to the roof With forked red tongues. Then every casement teemed With strange armed men, who leapt into the flames And perished. Those who, maimed and burnt, escaped, Ere they could gain their feet, a little band Of citizens, who sprang from out the night, Slew as they lay. The Prince, who bore my sister Unhurt to ground, stood for a moment mute. Then, seeing all was lost, he with a groan Stabbed himself where we stood. I fear his hurt Is mortal, since in vain I tried to staunch The rushing blood; then bade them on a litter Carry him hither gently. Here he comes. Enter Citizens, bearing Asander on a litter, wounded. Gycia. Oh, my love, thou art hurt! Canst thou forgive me? I thought to save thee and the rest. I knew not, I did not know! Oh, God! Asan. I do believe thee. The fates have led our feet by luckless ways Which only lead to death. I loved but thee. I wished thy State no wrong, but I am dying. Farewell! my love, farewell! [Dies. Gycia. Oh, my lost love! [Throws herself on the body and kisses it passionately. Zetho. Poor souls! Mysterious are the ways of Heaven, And these have suffered deeply in the fortune That bound their lives together. Bard. That dead man Would have betrayed our State, and thou dost pity! So perish all the enemies of Cherson! Gycia (rising). Nay, sir, be silent. 'Tis a coward's part To vilify the dead. You, my Lord Zetho, I had your promise that you would hurt none Except the guilty only, and I thought That to your word I might entrust my life And one more dear than mine; but now it seems That in some coward and unreasoning panic This worthy Senator has moved his colleagues‚Äî Since cruelty is close akin to fear‚Äî To break your faith to me, and to confuse The innocent and guilty, those who led And those who followed, in one dreadful death! I pray you pardon me if, being a woman, Too rashly taking part in things of State, I have known nought of State-craft or the wisdom Which breaks a plighted word. Zetho. Daughter, I would Our promise had been kept, and I had kept it But that the safety of the State to some Seemed to demand its breach. Gycia. Farewell, good Zetho, And all who were my friends. I am going hence; I can no longer stay. There lies my love. There flames my father's house. I go far-off, A long, long journey. If you see me not In life again, I humbly pray the State May, if it think me worthy‚Äîfor indeed I have given it all‚Äîbury me, when I die, Within the city, in a fair white tomb, As did our Grecian forefathers of old For him who saved the State; and, if it may be, Lay my love by my side. Zetho and Sens. Daughter, we swear That thou shalt have thy wish. Gycia. I thank you, sirs. Then, I may go. Kiss me, good Theodorus: I am no more a wife. I know thy love, And thank thee for it. For that wretch whose lie Has wrecked our life and love, I bless the gods That I am childless, lest my daughter grew As vile a thing as she; and yet I know not. She loved him in some sort, poor wretch, poor wretch! But now I must be going. 'Tis past midnight; [Snatches a dagger from Theodorus's side. I must go hence. I have lost my life and love, But I have saved the State. [Stabs herself and falls on Asander's body. Citizens of Cherson bursting in. Cits. The State is saved! Long may our Cherson flourish!

Sweet singer of the Spring, when the new world Was filled with song and bloom, and the fresh year Tripped, like a lamb playful and void of fear, Through daisied grass and young leaves scarce unfurled, Where is thy liquid voice That all day would rejoice? Where now thy clear and homely call, Which from gray dawn to evening's chilling fall Would echo from thin copse and tasselled brake, For homely duty tuned and love's dear sake? The spring-tide passed, high summer soon should come. The woods grew thick, the meads a deeper hue; The pipy summer growths swelled, lush and tall; The keen scythes swept at daybreak through the dew. Thou didst not heed at all, Thy prodigal voice grew dumb; No more with song mightst thou beguile, She sitting on her speckled eggs the while, Thy mate's long vigil as the slow days went, Solacing her with lays of measureless content. Nay, nay, thy voice was Duty's, nor would dare Sing were Love fled, though still the world were fair; The summer waxed and waned, the nights grew cold, The sheep lay thick within the wattled fold, The woods began to moan, Dumb wert thou and alone; Yet now, when leaves are sere, thy ancient note Comes low and halting from thy doubtful throat. Oh, lonely loveless voice, what dost thou here In the deep silence of the fading year? Thus do I read the answer of thy song: ‚ÄúI sang when winds blew chilly all day long; I sang because hope came and joy was near, I sang a little while, I made good cheer; In summer's cloudless day My music died away; But now the hope and glory of the year Are dead and gone, a little while I sing Songs of regret for days no longer here, And touched with presage of the faroff Spring.‚Äù Is this the meaning of thy note, fair bird? Or do we read into thy simple brain Echoes of thoughts which human hearts have stirred, High soaring joy and melancholy pain? Nay, nay, that lingering note Belated from thy throat‚Äî ‚ÄúRegret,‚Äù is what it sings, ‚Äúregret, regret! The dear days pass, but are not wholly gone. In praise of those I let my song go on; 'Tis sweeter to remember than forget.‚Äù IN A COUNTRY CHURCH. The organ peals, the people stand, The white procession through the aisles, As is our modern use, defiles In ranks, which part on either hand. They chant the psalms with resonant voice These peasants of our Saxon Kent; With the old Hebrew king rejoice, With him grow contrite and repent. But when the pale priest, blandly cold, White-winged above the eagle bends, I lose the ancient words of old, The monotone which still ascends For there the village school is set, A row of shining faces bright, Round cheeks by time unwrinkled yet, Smooth heads, and boyish collars white. And through the row there runs a smile, Like sunlight on a rippling sea‚Äî A childish mirth, devoid of guile; What may the merry movement be? The teachers frown; not far to seek The wonder seems, for it is this: A little scholar whose round cheek A stain of gules appears to kiss. For some low shaft of wintry sun Strikes where Dame Dorothy of the Grange, In long devotions never done, Kneels on through centuries of change; And from her robe's unfading rose, Athwart the fair heads ranged below, A ruddy shaft at random goes, And lights them with unwonted glow. And straightway all the scene but these Grows dim for me; I heed no more The preacher's smooth monotonies, The chants repeated o'er and o'er. For I am borne on fancy's wings Far from the Present to the Past; From those which pass to those which last, The root and mystery of Things. How many an old and vanished day, Has gone, she kneeling there the while, And watching, with her saintly smile, The generations fade away. The children came each Sunday there To hear the self-same chant and hymn; The boys grew strong, the girls grew fair, Their lives with fleeting years grew dim. Their children's children came and went, She kneeling in the self-same prayer; They passed to withered age, and bent, And left the Lady kneeling there. They grew, they waned through toil and strife, From innocence to guilt and sin; They gained what prize was theirs to win, They sank in shame the load of life. They passed, and on the churchyard ground No more their humble names are seen; Only upon the billowy mound Yearly the untrodden grass grows green. And still the kneeling Lady calm Throws gules on many a childish head, And still the self-same prayers are said, The self-same chant, the self-same psalm. So had it been, before as yet, Her far-off grandsires lived and died, Ere long descent had nourished pride, Before the first Plantagenet. No change, unless some change there were In simpler rite or grayer stone, The self-same worship never done, And for its very age grown fair. Great God, the creatures of Thy hand, Must they thus fail for ever still Thy high behests to understand, To seek and find Thy hidden will? Are Thy hands slow to succour then? And are Thy eyes, then, blind to see The toiling, tempted race of men Born into sin and misery? For nineteen centuries of Time, Nay more, for dim unnumbered years, Men's eyes have sought Thy face sublime, And turned uncomforted, in tears. For countless years unsullied youth Has sunk through grosser mire of sense; And yet men cherish innocence! And yet we are no nearer truth! And not the less from age to age Heavenward the unchanging suffrage rolls From hearts inspired by holy rage, And meek and uncomplaining souls, Who see no cloud of doubt o'erspread The far horizons of the sky, But view with clear, unfailing eye The mansions of the happy dead. Oh, wonder! oh, perplex√®d thought! Oh, interchange of good and ill! In vain, by life's long pain untaught, We strive to solve the riddle still. In vain, so mixed the twofold skein, That none the tangle may unwind; Where one the gate of Heaven may find, Another shrinks in hopeless pain. So here the immemorial sum Of simple reverence may breed A finer worship than might come For fruit of some severer creed. Kneel, Lady, blazoned in thy place! Through generations children kneel. To know is weaker than to feel: Though Truth seem far, we know her face! IN SPRING-TIDE. This is the hour, the day, The time, the season sweet. Quick! hasten, laggard feet, Brook not delay; Love flies, youth passes, Maytide will not last; Forth, forth, while yet 'tis time, before the Spring is past. The Summer's glories shine From all her garden ground, With lilies prankt around, And roses fine; But the pink blooms or white upon the bursting trees, Primrose and violet sweet, what charm has June like these? This is the time of song. From many a joyous throat, Mute all the dull year long, Soars love's clear note; Summer is dumb, and faint with dust and heat; This is the mirthful time when every sound is sweet. Fair day of larger light, Life's own appointed hour, Young souls bud forth in white‚Äî The world's a-flower; Thrill, youthful heart; soar upward, limpid voice; Blossoming-time is come‚Äîrejoice, joice, rejoice! IN AUTUMN. ‚ÄúDecay, decay,‚Äù the wildering west winds cry, ‚ÄúDecay, decay,‚Äù the moaning woods reply; The whole dead autumn landscape, drear and chill, Strikes the same chord of desolate sadness still. The drifting clouds, the floods a sullen sea, The dead leaves whirling from the ruined tree, The rain which falling soaks the sodden way, Proclaim the parting summer's swift decay. No song of bird, nor joyous sight or thing, Which smooths the wintry forefront of the spring; No violet lurking in its mossy bed, Nor drifted snow-bloom bending overhead, Nor kingcups carpeting the meads with gold, Nor tall spiked orchids purpling all the wold; But thin dull herbage which no more may grow, And dry reeds rustling as the chill winds blow, Bleak hillsides whence the huddled flocks are fled, And every spear of crested grass lies dead. ‚ÄúDecay, decay,‚Äù the leafless woodlands sigh, The torpid earth, and all the blinded sky, And down the blurred moor, 'mid the dying day, An age-worn figure limps its weary way. A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. Far in the west sinks down the Sun On bars of violet and gold, A soft breeze springs up fresh and cold, And darkness a transparent pall Upon the waiting earth begins to fall, And, decked with lucent gems of orb√®d light, Walks forth the sable Night, And once again the unfailing miracle is done. Ineffable, illimitable, immense, Wonder of wonders, mystery of Space, How can a finite vision meet thy face? How shall not our poor eyes, dazzled and dim, Which see but thy vast circle's outward rim, Sink touched before thy gaze with impotence? How shall our feeble voices dare to hymn Thy infinite glories‚Äîvoices which were best To mortal loves and earth's poor joys addrest? How seek our earthly limits to transcend, And, without halt or pause, Soaring beyond the twilight of our laws, Touch with a feeble hand on glories without end? Nay, great are these indeed And infinite, but not so great as He Their Maker who has formed them, who made me, Who can in fancy leap, outward and outward still Beyond our System and its farthest star, Beyond the greater Systems ranged afar, To which our faintest suns are satellites, and no more‚Äî Beyond, beyond, beyond, and strive to fill The illimitable void which never sense Nor thought alone may compass or contain, Then with a whirling brain Return to the great Centre of all light, Which doth control and bound the Infinite, And, looking to the undiscovered Sun, Find all perplexity and longing done, And am content to wonder and to adore. This 'tis alone Which doth console and soothe our feeble thought, Faint with the too great strain to comprehend A Universe, which owns nor source nor end. Wherever through the boundless wastes we stray, For ever and for ever, some faint ray Of the great central Sun, the hidden Will, Attends our wanderings still; Beyond the utmost limits of the sky, Unseen, yet seen, the gaze of an Eternal Eye. No waste of systems lies around, But a great Rule by which all things are bound. A changeless order circles sun with sun; One great Will pulses through, and makes them one. System on system, vast or small, One great Intelligence directs them all. No longer from the endless maze we shrink, Like those who on some sea-cliff's dreadful brink Long to fling down into the empty air And lose the pain of living, and to be Sunk in the deep abysses of the sea; To lose the pain of living and the care, Which dogs life like its shadow. Nay, no dread Have we who know a great Sun overhead, Which shines upon us always, unbeheld. How should our eyes behold what is too great For our imperfect state? How should our minds reach to it; how attain With a too feeble brain, To comprehend the Unbounded, the Immense, Incomprehensible by finite sense?‚Äî How through the Finite view the Infinite, Except by this clear Light? That is the light, indeed, Which lights all souls which come upon the earth. That is the central Sun which on our birth Shone, and will shine upon us till the end; A central Will which holds the worlds in space; A Presence, though we look not on its face, Which sows a cosmic order through the waste of things; A Being, all the beatings of whose wings Are secular wastes of Time; of whose great soul Creations are but moods, in whose vast mind Antinomies of Thought repose combined, Till those which seem to us as changeless laws Show but as phases of the Unchanging Cause, And we and all things fade and pass away, Lost in the effulgence of the Boundless Day. Let, then, unbounded Space, Sown thick with worlds, encompass us; we care No whit for it, nor shall our dazzled eyes This waste of Worlds surprise, Which have looked on its Maker, who is more Than all his work can be, but not the less Dwells in each human soul that looks on Him Albeit with vision dim; Whose constant Presence all our lives confess, Of whom we are a part, and closer far Than is the furthest, most unmeasured star, Than are His great suns, big with fruitful strife, Seeing that we are a portion of His Life, Seeing that we hold His Essence‚Äîsome clear spark, Which shines when all creation else grows dark, And are, however impotent and small, One with the Will that made and governs all. And now the night grows thin; A subtle air of newness seems to stir Before the dawn, as if its harbinger To prisoned souls within, Proclaiming the near coming of the day. Then Darkness, a great bird, with raven wing, Flies to the furthest west, and in her stead Young Day, an orient conqueror overhead, Looks down, and all that waste of worlds has fled; And once again the Eternal, mystic Birth Is born upon the earth, And once again the round of wholesome life, The doubt-dispelling stir and joyous strife, Chases the dreadful visions of the night, Lost in the increasing light; And from the spheres a still voice seems to say, ‚ÄúAwake, arise, adore, behold the Day! It is enough to be, nor question why; It is enough to work our work and die; It is enough to feel and not to know. Behold, the Dawn is breaking; let us go.‚Äù AN ENGLISH IDYLL. Once I remember, in a far-off June, Leaving the studious cloister of my youth, Beside the young Thames' stream I laid me down, Wearied, upon a bank. 'Twas midsummer; The warm earth teemed with flowers; the kingcup's gold, The perfumed clover, 'mid the crested grass, The plantains rearing high their flowery crowns Above the daisied coverts; overhead, The hawthorns, white and rosy, bent with bloom, The broad-fanned chestnuts spiked with frequent flowers, And white gold-hearted lilies on the stream; All these made joy within my heart, and woke The fair idyllic phantasies of Greece; And dreaming, well content with the rich charm Of summer England, long I idly mused; ‚ÄúAnd were the deep-set vales of Thessaly Or fair Olympian beech-groves more than this? Or the Sicilian meads more rich in flowers, Where the lost goddess plucked the asphodel? Or flowed the clear stream through a lovelier shade Where Dian bathed and rapt Act√¶on saw? Or were they purer depths where Hyias played Till the nymphs drew him down? Ah, fairer dreams Than our poor England holds! Grave, toil-worn land! Poor ag√®d mother of a graceless brood, With shambling gait and limbs by labour bent! What should she know of such?‚Äù When straight I heard A ripple of boyish mirth, and looking saw Far off along the meads a gliding boat Float noiselessly; lithe forms at either end‚Äî The self-same forms which Phidias fixed of old‚Äî With tall poles, pressed it forward, others lay Reclined, and all had crowned their short smooth hair With lilies from the stream, while one had shaped Some hollow reed in semblance of a pipe, Making a shrill faint sound‚Äîa joyous crew, Clothed with the grace of innocent nakedness. Then, while they yet were far, ere yet a sound Of their poor rustic tones assailed the sense, Or too great nearness marred the grace of form‚Äî Poised sudden in a white row, side by side, They plunged down headlong in the sweet warm tide. Then, as I went, within myself I said, ‚ÄúThe young Apollo is not wholly fled, Nor can long centuries of toil and care Make youth less comely or the earth less fair. To the world's ending Joy and Grace shall be. I, too, have been to-day in Arcady.‚Äù ANIMA MUNDI. Oh great World-Spirit, wherefore art thou come? We crave an answer, but thy voice is dumb. Oh great World-Spirit, whither dost thou tend? By what dark paths to what mysterious end? We do not know, we cannot tell at all, Only before thy onward march we fall. Nay, but before thy throne we fall, we kneel; We crave not that thy face thou shouldst reveal; We do not seek to know, only to feel. We praise thee not in words our tongues can tell; Though thy hand slay us, we will not rebel. Whate'er thy will design for us, 'tis well. Compute our lives with all thy boundless past, Project them on thy abysmal Future vast; Only let all be merged in Thee at last. IN PEMBROKESHIRE, 1886. Through crested grass I took my way From my loved home. The sun was high; The warm air slept the live-long day; No shadowy cloudlet veiled the sky. The swift train swept with rhythmic tune, By endless pastures hurrying down, White farm, lone chapel, castled town, Then, fringed with weed, the salt lagune, At last the land-locked haven blue, Thin-sown with monstrous works of war, And on the sweet salt air I knew Faint sounds of cheering from afar. Strong arms and backs are bent, and then They draw us up the fluttering street; Behind, there comes the ordered beat Of long-drawn files of marching men. At last a halt; a steep hillside Set thick with toil-worn workers strong, Grave faces stretching far and wide, Fired with the hope to banish wrong. Ah me! how thin one voice appears, To reach so many eager minds! Nay, for it speaks to willing ears, And what the hearer seeks he finds. Unhappy Island of the West! Thy brethren these in race and blood, Not like thee tempted or opprest, But filled with longing for thy good. For just is manhood rude and strong And generous the toiler's soul; When these the ship of State control, Oppression shall not flourish long. The crowds are gone, the hillside bare, The last good-nights at length are said, The harbour crossed again, the fair Large star of eve hangs overhead. The shades of tardy evening fall; Lights come in casements here and there; Through dewy meads on the cool air The wandering landrails hoarsely call. The silent roads loom ghostly white; No veil of darkness hides the skies; A sunless dawn appears to rise Upon the stilly charm√®d night. The day's hot concourse comes to seem Far, far away; the eager crowd, The upturned gaze, the plaudits loud, In the cool silence like a dream. And oh, sweet odours, which the air Of the calm summer midnight deep Draws from the rose which lies asleep, And bowery honeysuckles fair. Oh, perfumed night! Some tremulous bird From the thick hedgerows seems to thrill. No other sound but this is heard, Save ringing horsehoofs, beating still. Midnight is past; there comes a gleam, Precursor of the scarce-set sun. Through gray streets hushed as in a dream We sweep, and the long day is done. Men pass, but still shall Nature keep Her night's cool calm, her dawn's bright glow; Unseen her fragrant wild flowers creep, Unmarked her midnight odours blow. The long injustices of years Shall pass; the hapless Western Isle Shall dry the age-long trace of tears, And show instead a happy smile. The wheels of Fate are swiftly borne From point to point, from change to change; What yesterday was new and strange, To-morrow scouts as old and worn. I may forget the shouting crowd, The sea of eyes which upward turn, The kindling cheeks, the plaudits loud, The sympathies which glow and burn. Ay, all things change, but hardly those Shall fade‚Äîthe midnight calm of June, The cool sweet airs, the night-bird's tune, The perfume of the dreaming rose. EASTER-TIDE. Awake, arise, oh Earth! Thy hour has come at last; The winter's ruin past, Spring comes to birth. The virgin world with flowers again grows bright, And in the increasing light Doth clothe herself with beauty; once again A new creation issues with a stately train. Oh soul of man, arise And keep thy Easter-tide, White clothed as is a bride, With calm pure eyes; When all things living else rejoice, Not thine should be the voice Alone to keep dull silence, mute, unheard, Amid the joy that wakens every nesting bird. 'Tis an old Spring of mirth That bids our souls arise; No other moved the priests and augurs wise Upon the younger earth When for the Passover the lamb was slain, Nor when they did complain Of old time for the fair Adonis dead, Greeting with tears of joy that dear recovered head. The same, yet not the same, Joy fuller, deeper grief Than in the old ages came To wake belief. The Spring our voices celebrate to-day Is not the Spring which fades with May, Nor that renewal ours which shall be done Soon as our earth leans outward from the averted sun. Nor as theirs is our loss Who wept the enamoured boy; Ours is a heavier cross, A livelier joy, Mixed in such sort with grief that one is bred From the other and by it nourish√®d, So that without the salutary pain Were no place left for this triumphant gain. Great Law of Sacrifice On which our lives are built, That with our load of guilt Soars to the skies, I doubt if ever there was race of man But based its life on such a mystic plan, From old Prometheus' godlike treachery To calm Osiris cold and sad Persephone. Therefore, because the end Of Winter comes and Death, Our yearning souls ascend, Faith quickeneth. How should it be that man alone could cease When all things else increase? Man, the first fruit of Time, Creation's crown‚Äî Shall he, while all is Spring, lie hopeless and cast down? Ay, always with the Spring The waking comes again; Mixed tones of joy and pain Our life-chords sing. Sweet are the songs of autumn, sweet of death, And bitter sweet the first-drawn breath, And sweet, though full of pain, the mortal strife When from Death's grasp we struggle into Life. That is the law of life‚Äî Joy bought by sacrifice, Pleasure for hopeless sighs, And rest for strife. The earth is no more, as it was at first, By some strange spell accurst; A mystery has passed a mystery, A boundless hope has bid new heavens and earth to be. Rise, happy Earth, arise, Thy wintry darkness done, To greet the new-risen sun Oh soul, arise! The joy which stirs the world let it wake thee. A symbol of thy risen life is born. Awake, arise! this is the very morn; A mystery has been! a mystery! GHOSTS. Sometimes in some forsaken place, Hid from the aspect of the sun, We come on some forgotten trac√© Of life and years long dead and done. Some faded picture's doubtful truth, Fixed in the springtime of our days, Which through all change of mien portrays The evanescent charm of youth‚Äî The rounded cheek, the wealth of hair, The bright young eye's unclouded blue. White head, wan face, were you thus fair? Sad eyes, and were these ever you? Changed, and yet still unchanged through change, The self-same lives for good or ill, Thin ghosts with features known, yet strange, Of us who live and travail still. Thin ghosts! or is it we who fade And are deceased, and keep no more Than some thin unsubstantial shade Of the young hopes and fears of yore? Who knows what Life, or Death, or Time Are in themselves, or whither tend The great world's footsteps slow, sublime, From what dim source‚Äîto what hidden end? Or if our growth be but decay, Or if all Life must wax and grow, Or if no change true Being know, Though all things outward pass away? Ah! not in outward things we know The chiefest work of Time and Change; But new faiths come, old thoughts grown strange, Old longings which no more may glow. Some time-stained sheaf of youthful verse, Some inarticulate yearning dumb, Once dear, ere time and age had come To turn the better to the worse. In these the gazer starts to see A self, not his, reflected most, And asking, ‚ÄúWere these part of me?‚Äù Knows he has looked upon a ghost. SONG. [Love took my life and thrilled it] Love took my life and thrilled it Through all its strings, Played round my mind and filled it With sound of wings, But to my heart he never came To touch it with his golden flame. Therefore it is that singing I do rejoice, Nor heed the slow years bringing A harsher voice, Because the songs which he has sung Still leave the untouched singer young. But whom in fuller fashion The Master sways, For him, swift winged with passion, Fleet the brief days. Betimes the enforc√®d accents come, And leave him ever after dumb. FROM WILD WALES. I. LLYN Y MORWYNION. By fair Festinlog, 'mid the Northern Hills, The vales are full of beauty, and the heights, Thin-set with mountain sheep, show statelier far Than in the tamer South. There the stern round Of labour rules,‚Äîa silent land, sometimes Loud with the blast that buffets all the hills Whereon the workers toil, in quarries hewn Upon the terraced rocksides. Tier on tier, Above the giddy depths, they edge and cling Like flies to the sheer precipice as they strike The thin cleft slate. For solace of their toil Song comes to strengthen them, and songlike verse In the old Cymric measures, and the dream Of fame when all the listening thousands round Are ranged in Session, and the rapt array Expectant of the singer's soaring voice, Or full quire rising thund'rous to the skies, The sheathed swords, and the sacred Chair of oak, Where sits the Bard. But most of all they prize Old memories of the Past, forgotten feuds, And battles long ago. One tale they tell Of a deep tarn upon the mountain side, Llyn y Morwynion called,‚Äî‚ÄúThe Maidens' Lake;‚Äù And thus it is the fair old story runs. On Arvon once the men of Meirion, Being alone, nor having hearth or home, Swooped down when all her warriors were afield Against the foemen. And they snatched from them The flower of all the maidens of the race, And to their mountain fastness far away Bare them unchecked. There with great care and love They tended them, and in the captives' hearts The new observance slowly ousted all The love of home and country, till they stayed Content, forgetting all their lives before, Parents and kinsfolk, everything but love. But when the war was ended, and their arms Set free, the men of Arvon sent demand That they should straight restore to home and kin The maidens they had rapt. Then came great doubt Upon the men of Meirion, knowing well Their strength too weak to match the Arvonian hosts In unassisted war; heralds they sent To Arvon asking peace, making amends For what had been their fault. But the others nursed Deep anger in their hearts, and to their words Made only answer, ‚ÄúGive ye back untouched Our daughters and our sisters, whom your fraud Has stolen from us, or prepare to die.‚Äù Then they, taking deep counsel with themselves, Swore, not for life itself would they return The women, only if themselves should will To leave them; and they made request of them That they might know their wish. But when they sought To question them, they answered with one voice‚Äî ‚ÄúWe will not go; for barren is the lot Of maidenhood, and cold the weary fate Of loveless lives, the household tasks whose weight Bears down the childless woman. Since we came We have known life in the full light of home. Say to our sires and brothers, that we stay Willing, and bid our young men that they wive From out some noble tribe; for thus it is Our Cymric race grows strong. But do ye bid Our mothers comfort them, for they shall take Their grandsons on their knees; for we are wed And cannot more return. Not Fate itself Can e'er recall the irrevocable Past.‚Äù But when the men of Arvon heard the hest The herald brought, their souls were wroth in them Against the ravishers, whose cunning wiles Had worked such wrong. They called their warriors forth From every hill and dale, and marched in haste To Meirion. And they summoned them to yield, But they refused; and so the fight was set For the morrow, on the margin of a mere Deep down within the circuit of the hills. There, with the sun, within a close-set pass The men of Meirion stood, a scanty band, Waiting the approaching host. With grief and pain They left their loves, and swift, with breaking day, Marched with unfaltering steps, without a word, To the field of honour, as men go who know That all beside is lost. But as they stood, Ranged in stern silence, waiting for the fray, They saw a white procession thread the pass Behind, now seen, now lost, by flowery bends, Gorse-gold and heather-purple. At their head Blodeuwedd, she the flower in face and form By magic formed, by magic art foredoomed To sin and suffer. Then again they knew The bitterness of death, and clasped once more The forms they loved, when by the lake the sun Lit the fierce light of countless marching spears. Then with a last embrace the tearful throng Withdrew to where above the fastness rose A purple slope. No way the assailing host Might find to it while yet one stalwart arm Of Meirion lived. Toward the lake it fell, Till in a sheer, precipitous cliff it sank, Its base in the unfathomable deep. Now, while the maidens like a fleece of cloud Whitened the hill, or like a timid flock From nearer danger shrinking, swift there came Along the grassy margin of the lake The glimmering spears of Arvon. And their sires And brethren saw them, and great wrath and joy Fired them and urged them onward, till they surged And broke on Meirion. But her strong sons stood And flung them backward; and the frightened throng Of white-robed suppliants saw the deed, and feared, Hiding their eyes, hovering 'twixt hope and fear, Divided 'twixt their lovers and their kin. All day the battle raged, from morn to eve; All day the men of Arvon charged and broke, And charged again the little band which stood Unshaken in the pass, but hourly grew Weaker and weaker still. Then at the last The noise of battle ceased awhile; the shouts, The cries, grew silent. On the purple hill The kneeling women saw the Arvonian host Retreating with their dead, and rose to go With succour to their lovers. As they gazed, Sudden, as with a last despairing strength And a hoarse shout, again, a torrent of steel, The men of Arvon, by their own weight pressed, Burst on the scant defenders of the pass; Like some fierce surge which from the storm-vext sea, Through narrow inlets fenced by rocky walls, Lifts high its furious crest, and sweeps in ruin Within the rayless, haunted ocean-caves, Rocks, wreckage, and the corpses of the dead. And as the women, impotent to save, With agonizing hands and streaming eyes Looked down upon the pass, they saw their loves Driven back, o'erwhelmed, surrounded, flashing swords And thrusting spears and broken shields, and heard The noise of desperate battle, then a pause And silence, as the last of Meirion's sons Sank in his blood and the long fight was done. Then suddenly, ere yet the conquering host Might climb to them, Blodeuwedd, standing clothed In her unearthly beauty, faced the throng Of shrinking women. Not a word she spake. The sinking sun upon her snowy robe Shone with unearthly gold; like some fair bird Leading the flock she showed. With one white arm She pointed to the dreadful pass where lay The thick-piled corpses, with the other signed Toward the sheer cliff, and to the lake beneath Motioned. One word she uttered‚Äî‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù And all who heard it knew and shared her mind. Then looking to the heavens, she hurried down Through thyme and heather, chanting some wild hymn To the Immortal Gods; and with her went The white-robed throng, and when they gained the verge, Without a pause, plunged through the empty air Into the unfathomed depths, like some great flight Of white birds swooping from a seacliff down To ocean. The still waters leapt in foam; One loud shriek only woke the air, and then Silence was over all, and night and death. Still sometimes, when the dreaming peasants go By the lone mountain tarn at shut of day, The white clouds with the eve descending swift Down the steep hillside to the lake may seem The white-robed maidens falling, and the shriek Of night-birds, fair Blodeuwedd and her train; And fancy, by the ancient fable fed, Turns from the duller Present's dust and glare To the enchanted twilights of the Past. II. THE PHYSICIANS OF MYDDFAI. Far, far away in wild Wales, by the shore of the boundless Atlantic, Where the cloud-capt peaks of the North are dwarfed to the hills of the South, And through the long vale to the sea, the full-fed, devious Towy Turns and returns on itself, like the coils of a silvery snake, A grey town sits up aloft on the bank of the clear, flowing river, As it has sat since the days when the Roman was first in the land. A town, with a high ruined castle and walls mantled over with ivy, With church towers square and strong and narrow irregular streets, And, frequent in street and lane, many-windowed high-shouldered chapels, Whence all the still Sabbath ascend loud preaching and passionate prayer, Such violent wrestling with sin, that the dogs on the pavement deserted Wake with a growl from their dreams at the sound of the querulous voice, And the gay youths, released from the counter and bound for the seaside or hillside, Start as they wake on their way echoes of undevout feet, And here and there a rude square, with statues of popular heroes, A long quay with scarcely a ship, and a hoary bridge spanning the stream, The stream which struggles in June by the shallows where children are swimming, The furious flood which at Yule roars seaward, resistless along, Though the white steam ribbons float by it, forlorn it seems, almost forsaken. All the day long in the week the dumb streets are hushed in repose, But on market or fair days there comes a throng of Welsh-speaking peasants From many a lonely farm in the folds of the rain-beaten hills, And the long streets are filled with the high-pitched speech of the chaffering Cymry, With a steeple-crowned hat, here and there, and the red cloaks which daunted the French. Scarce in Keltic Brittany's self, or in homely Teutonic Silesia, So foreign a crowd may you see as in this far corner of Wales. Above the grey old town, at the mouth of the exquisite valley, Rises a quaint village church deep in o'ershadowing yews; On a round-topped hill it stands, looking down on the silvery river And the smooth meadows fenced by tall elms, and the black kine, like flies on the green. Below, 'midst its smooth-pleached lawns, stands the many-roofed Anglican palace, And aloft from its straight-ridged pines, the enchanter's summit ascends. Thence along the upward vale, by fold upon fold of the river, By park and by tower, at last the far-off mountain chains soar, Flecked with shadow and sunshine which float on the side of the desolate moorland, And the whole still landscape lies bathed in a haze of ineffable peace. There, where the mountains ascend by the white little town of Llandovery, Steep as a crater the side of the circular summit dips down. A blue lake lies beneath, deep set in the desolate hollow, Where scarcely a breath of air ruffles in summer its face. The Van Lake 'tis called of old time, like the Van Lake of distant Armenia. Hardly a wayfarer's foot comes near, or a wayfarer's eye. But far, far below are seen the white homesteads, dotting the valley, And to-day, as of old, still silence and solitude everywhere reign. There, as in crowded towns, life is real and full of striving; There, too, is life fulfilled of small hopes and of trivial fears. There, too, the finger of fate, unavoidable, pitiless, awful, Points with unfaltering aim, to the road which our footsteps shall tread. Love is among them, and hate, low desires and high aspirations, Fortune is blind there as here, the good mourn, and the wicked rejoice. Only there the sense of the Past, the romantic, the mystical lingers, Touched with a glamour and charm, denied to the turmoil of towns. The light which never has been, still shines on those hillsides secluded, Illuming with rays, not of earth, those homely and labouring lives. Here is a tale which is cherished to-day through that far-withdrawn valley, Half believed by the ag√®d folk still, but year by year fading away. Long, long ago, when our Princes were falling in fight with the Norman, And all our wild Wales lay o'erwhelmed by a torrent of rapine and blood, A brave peasant woman strove here with hard fate, though her husband had fallen, Strove for her only boy, who was rising to manhood apace. So close was the bond which bound widowed mother and dutiful stripling, None of Myddfai's daughters touched the young man's self-contained heart. A kindly fortune smiled on the toil of the desolate woman, Their flocks and their herds increased on the meads of the bountiful vale, So quickly their numbers grew, that from the shorn valley he drove them To fresh fields and pastures new on the side of the mystical hills. Morning and evening he watched on the lonely side of the hollow, While the grey kine wandered at will on the hill's half-precipitous steep. Oft on the lake's still surface, no breath came to ruffle the mirror, Nor sound, save the boulders rolled downward, that stirred for a moment its calm. All the day long he mused, wrapt in thought on the desolate hillside, All day the sure-footed kine cropt the sweet grass of the hills. Thoughts came to him, innocent thoughts of a chaste youth guileless of error, Thoughts of a maiden as fair as a young man's passionate dream. Fair were the maidens of Myddfai, but fairer his far-off ideal, Which touched with a glamour of gold the day-dreams of innocent youth. All the day long he dreamt on, gazing down on the blue of the waters, Till the plash of the trout, as they rose, seemed the oar of some mystical bark; All the day long he mused, and with evening, by moonlight or starlight, Dreaming he wound his slow way with his kine to the valley below, Dreaming through fair summer days and the long dark evenings of winter The sweet shy dreams of a youth fulfilled of a virginal shame. In secret his mother noted the dreams which her son was dreaming, Marking the far-off look in the absent eyes of the boy. Fain would she rouse him with jests and bantering words, but the stripling Smiled a soft smile in reply, then turned to his musings again. When he had spent many days in happy and undisturbed dreaming, One day, as the setting sun threw beams of bright gold on the lake, Lo! a great marvel and wonder, a herd of phantom-like oxen Seemed to his dazzled eyes to emerge from the mystical depths. White they were, brindled and white, heavy dewlapped, lords of the meadows, Driven as it seemed by a swan from the lake's far centre along. Nearer and nearer they drew, till the swan to his yearning vision Grew to a maiden as fair as the fanciful Fair of his dreams. Gold were her locks and blue her eyes as the clear sky of autumn, White was her bosom and red the half-opened rose of her mouth. Nearer and nearer she came, till the youth, with ineffable longing, Stretched forth his passionate arms to fold to his bosom the Fair, Stretched forth, and offered her bread in humble token of friendship; But the Fair smiled a sweet smile, smiled and eluded his grasp. Then, as he stood on the brink, in mute and motionless yearning, Lo! with a silvery laugh, the fair vision faded away. Oftentimes thus on the brink he stood afterwards waiting the maiden, Often she came not at all, or a strong wind ruffled the deep. Twice again did she come, and he held forth bread for her taking, Still, with a silvery laugh, refusing, she faded away. Careworn the young man grew, and spent with unsatisfied yearnings, Nor recked though the kine unheeded strayed on the perilous steeps. Never again the lake maiden came by sunlight or moonlight, Till his fond hope too long deferred, wasted him body and soul. All his sleepless nights were filled with the pitiless vision; All the musing days, a slow fire burned in his breast; Half ashamed, he told his mother his pain, and the pitying woman Sighed that her son should thus pine, but knew not to succour his grief. Marking his cheeks' red flush, she feared lest her son might be taken, Till she found no heart for her toil, and her substance wasted away. There, when Midsummer Eve was come, the magical season, The young man wandered in vain on the brink of the mystical lake; There, when All-Hallow-tide came, he wandered, if only the maiden Might rise on his longing eyes; but never at all did she come. At last, on the year's last night, he, stealthily rising at midnight, To the cold lake side went, hopeless, with faltering feet. The full moon bathed in silver steep hillside and slumbering waters. By the cold lake side he paused, with something of half-renewed hope, When, borne on the face of the waters, behold by the reeds of the lake side Floating a magical disc of milk-white mystical bread. Swift, yet with reverence too, as one taking the Host at the altar, Kneeling, the youth partook of the strange ineffable food, Till ere the weird rite was ended, again a marvellous portent Greeted his longing eyes, and stayed the quick throb of his heart, For lo! on the silvery path of the moon on the undisturbed waters, The herd that he saw once before came slowly gliding to land, And beyond them‚Äîoh, vision of bliss!‚Äîthe maid of his dreams, approaching, Plying a light golden oar, in a swift-moving shallop of gold. Nearer she came and more near, while his heart stood still with emotion, Fearing the glorious dream should once again vanish away; Nearer and nearer she came, and leaped from the skiff to the lake side, And lay, in unearthly beauty, willingly clasped in his arms. When he found tongue to speak, ‚ÄúOh, my love, at last have I found thee! Though not of earth is thy race, oh, stoop to my virginal love. Oh, it is long I have loved thee, and though I know thee immortal, Tarry awhile, fair vision, leave me not loveless again! Come from thy mountain heights, come from thy dwelling deep down in the waters. Pity me ere I die who can only live in thy love.‚Äù Then the maid, ‚ÄúRhiwallon, I love thee; long time have I tried thy devotion, Long have I pitied thy vigils spent in these desolate hills; Always have I been near thee, unseen have I witnessed thy yearnings, Only the mystical bread was wanting to join us in one. Now we are one heart and soul, I will live with thee always, and love thee.‚Äù And together the mystical bread they ate, and their lives were made one. Then said the maiden, ‚ÄúOh, mortal! this warning I needs must give thee. Thy wife will I be all thy days‚Äîthy dear wife, faithful and true, Nourish thy children, obey thee in all things, be dutiful always, Fill all thy fields with the dowry thou seest of full-uddered kine, Love thee and cherish thee always, and plenish thy barn with good harvests, Long as the will of high Heaven gives thee to live upon earth. Only, this ordinance holds if a maid of the race of immortals Wed with a mortal on earth, leaving her higher estate, If he should strike her three times, she and hers, her bonds being loosened, Whether she will it or not, return to her kindred again.‚Äù Careless the fond youth heard, and smothered her warning with kisses, And down through the joyous New Year he went with his bride to their home. Long in great welfare they lived, knit together in happy wedlock; Never a cloud arose on the tranquil sky of their home, The great herds throve and increased more than all the herds of the valley, The robbers who harried the vale left them untouched and in peace. Never was husband more fond of the wife of his boyish affection, Never was wife more sweet, or fuller of dutiful love. The good mother died full of years, and calling her daughter bless√®d. Children were born of their love, more than others prudent and fair. Their strong sons were good and discreet, laborious, eager for knowledge, Scarcely the Abbot himself equalled their learning, 'twas said; Fair were the daughters and good, sweet, dutiful maidens, and prudent; Nowhere in all our wild Wales was a race so gracious and fair. And yet, when their wedlock was new, that had happened which now was forgotten. The youth and his bride were bidden one day to a christening feast. The young husband hastened to go; but the wife, with half-hid reluctance, Loitered till almost too late to traverse the difficult hills. Many a pretext she urged, not loving the rites of religion, Holding some primitive faith, old as the hills and the seas, Till, when the hour was grown late, Rhiwallon in playful impatience, Seeking his wife up and down, found her reluctant at last. ‚ÄúCome,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwife, it is time,‚Äù and smilingly on her fair shoulder Tapped with his empty glove, and she rose and obeyed with a sigh. ‚ÄúDearest, remember,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúmy warning when first we were wedded; Once that has been which should not. Remember, be careful, my heart!‚Äù Then to the christening she went, nor shrank from the priest nor the water, Only a vague disquietude long time troubled their souls. Also long years after this, when the past was wellnigh forgotten, They were bidden together again to a gay marriage feast in the vale; Not now was the wife unwilling, but ready to go and eager. In deep contentment the pair went forth to the innocent feast. Duly the marriage sped, the priest said his mystical office, No word the good wife spake, as she knelt in her place by her lord; But when the marriage was done, and they sate at the jovial bride-feast, Sudden the goodman perceived his wife in a passion of tears; Sobbing, she sate by his side inconsolable loudly lamenting, Till all the gay company rose with dismay from the midst of their mirth. Always her prescient soul saw the future hidden from mortals, The grief that should come of that day, the dreadful problems of life, The lives that from that day's mirth should arise‚Äîto what fate predestined? The long generations of men foredoomed to sorrow alone. Knowing the fever of life and its ending, the mystical woman Held not her peace, but burst forth in a passion of weeping and pain; But Rhiwallon, knowing not all, but filled with distress for the bridefolk, Turned to her, and bidding her cease, touched lightly her arm in reproof. In one moment she ceased from her wailing, and scarcely regarding her goodman, ‚ÄúLove,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthat was the second time; only one other remains.‚Äù All these things had they almost forgot, living happy in wedlock, Watching their children grow to strong manhood and womanhood fair; Smoothly their lives flowed along in unbroken weal and affection, As their devious Towy, which wound through cornland and mead to the sea. Not a thought had the goodman of death, or of parting, than death more bitter; But the goodwife, loving her lord, watched with solicitous thought. Scarce from her prescient mind had faded the danger which pressed them, The bliss which a careless touch might turn in a moment to pain; Here on the kindly earth she had made her choice and her dwelling, Here she would willingly live with her husband, and with him would die. Far off her birthland appeared, cold and lifeless the mystical waters; Better to sleep in the meads than to pass that cold portal again. Love's light beaming warm on her life, in her veins the warm human life-blood Filled with new longings a heart which was only half human before. ‚ÄúWhat would life profit her now to those ice-cold abysses returning? Better to die upon earth by the fate which awaiteth us all.‚Äù Thus the goodwife, half human in heart, mused in silence, her children around her, Filled with a deep boding sense of the terrible nearness of fate. Last it befell once again that the pair were bidden together (Christening for youth, for full age bride-feasts, for old age the grave), To a solemn burial they went; 'twas a friend of their youth who was taken. All the desolate house was hushed in mourning and tears, But before the dead was borne forth, the strange heart of the mystical woman, Long keeping silence with pain, broke out at last into mirth. Was it because she knew that the burden of living is heavy, From what load of misery here the dead are delivered by death? Or was it because she knew of her old prim√¶val religion How much higher than human life is the lot of the just who are dead? Or was it her soul had beheld the restitution of all things, And felt a great hope and joy which lightened the shadow of death? Who shall tell? but her elfin nature broke forth in immoderate laughter, Piercing the mourners' hearts, as they stood round the bier of the dead. Long time the goodman was mute, till at last keen shame overcame him, No more could he suffer unmoved that meaningless laughter and joy. ‚ÄúHush, hush! wife,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou forget,‚Äù and touched her again on the shoulder. ‚ÄúFor the ending of troubles I laughed,‚Äù she replied, and grew grave and was still. Then with a sob and a sigh the goodwife, looking behind her, Rose from her place by her lord and swiftly passed forth by the door. ‚ÄúFarewell,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúoh my love; thou hast struck me the third and the last time. Fate 'tis that parteth us‚ÄîFate! Farewell! I shall see thee no more.‚Äù So strange she showed and so weird that the goodman dared not detain her. Seeing his goodwife no more, and knowing the finger of Fate; Seeing his goodwife no more, no longer the well-beloved features, The hair that was silvered by time, the dim eyes with their motherly care; But the radiant figure once more, golden-haired, azure-eyed, and immortal, That at midnight arose, long ago, from the depths of the mystical lake. None offered to stay her course, but she glided alone, unattended, Splendid in radiant youth, up the lonely, precipitous hills. Not to her home or her children returned, nor tarried a moment; Straight to the hillside she went, weeping and blinded with tears, And as she passed by the fields where her magical cattle were grazing, Always she carolled aloud a strange and mystical song. ‚ÄúCome hither, Brindle!‚Äù she sang; ‚Äúcome, White Spot! bring your calves with you! Come thou, White Lord of the Herd, who wert born in the House of the King! Come, we must go to our home! and ye, yoked patient-eyed oxen, Come with me, come with the rest; it is time, come all of ye home!‚Äù The great herds heard the call, and streamed in an endless procession; The gray oxen burst from the furrow, leaving the ploughshare behind. Up the rough hillside they climbed behind her, obeying her mandate, Till they showed to the gazers below like a white cloud mounting the steep. Up the steep hillside they sped to the lake, and the wondering peasants Heard a clear voice from the hill, ‚ÄúDeuwch adre! Deuwch adre! Come home!‚Äù Never again upon earth had Rhiwallon sight of his helpmeet, Never again did he seek his love on the lake and the hills; Wayworn and weary he grew, nor might dreams of beauty allure him. The face that he loved and lost was ag√®d, with silvery hair; But the beautiful being who went from her seat at the fateful banquet‚Äî What was her youth to his age, or his age to her radiant youth? What if his eyes once again should perceive the bright vision of old time. Old as he was, and changed from the hopeful dreams of the boy? Nay, it would kill him to see the black deep which had taken his life's love. Never again did he gaze on its hateful magical face. But the strong sons, when they knew their mother was gone from among them‚Äî Gone without even a word, to strange death or to mystical life‚Äî Evening by evening would climb the lonely, precipitous hillside, Yearning if haply their eyes might see the loved features again. Long, long vigils they spent in vain, nor ever the vision Came, any more than it comes to all children orphaned on earth, Till one night, when all hope was dead, they burst into passionate weeping. ‚ÄúMother, thy children,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúcall thee, and call thee in vain. Break through the fetters of Fate, take again thy womanly nature; Come to us, mother, once more, let us see thee and hear thee again.‚Äù And lo! as they looked, in the moonlight a shining, beautiful figure Came in a shallop of gold, on the silvery path of the moon. Nearer and nearer it came; but lo! as they gazed in fond yearning, Not as their mother it seemed, but a youthful, fairy-like form. Gold were her locks and blue her eyes, as the clear sky of autumn. Bitterly weeping, they turned from the lake side with sinking young hearts‚Äî Turned from the lake side, and went, side by side, down the hill paths in silence, Silent, with never a word, till they came within sight of their home. Then close behind them they heard a sweet voice, which called to them softly And, turning round quickly, they saw the mother they loved and had lost. ‚ÄúListen, dear sons,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúWith what spells you have drawn me ye know not. No power but motherly love can bring an immortal to earth, No other love can avail to reknit the bonds that are broken; Only her child's strong cry calls back a mother again. Give me your hands and kiss me; for see, I am old as you knew me, The youth of those cold depths changed for the kindlier ripeness of earth. Lo, I am now as I was, when an earthly love kept me among you, Only I view all things with a clearer and perfecter sight. Yours, dear sons, it must be to succour your suffering brothers. Bound to a body which age and disease waste quickly away, Healers your race shall be, knowing many a secret of Nature, And all the virtues of herbs, which are sent for the comfort of man. When ye come to these lonely heights, I will meet you and speak with you always, Teaching the secrets of life, which are hid from the great ones of earth. Come to me often, dear sons; I shall see you afar, and will meet you, Walk with you always, discourse with you, teach you to live and be wise. Say to my girls that they cherish their father and comfort him always; Bid them remember their mother, who loves as she loved them on earth. And now, farewell, dear hearts, since to earth your yearnings have brought me. While you live I will always be with you. Be wise, then, my children, and good.‚Äù Often at evening, the youths would climb to the mystical lake side, Culling the simples that grew on the slopes of the desolate hills‚Äî ‚ÄúPanty Meddygon,‚Äù men called it, ‚ÄúThe dingle of the Physicians‚Äù‚Äî And with them, wherever they went, their mother invisible came, Teaching them all that 'tis lawful to know of the secrets of Nature And the powers of healing that seem to be God's own prerogative gift. Such was the knowledge they took from their loving, mystical mother, In all our wide Britain was found no leech so skilful as they. All the sick of the country around flocked to them to be healed by their cunning; Broad lands in Myddfai and rank the Lord Rhys gave for their skill. Often, for years and for years, men might see the gentle Physicians Culling the herbs on the hills, to battle with death and with pain. From manhood to age they passed, still learning and perfecting knowledge, Mounting the hillside at last with slower and tottering steps; And often a shepherd would tell of a clear voice which spoke with them always, And oft of a shadowy form, guiding their faltering feet. So they passed, and were laid in the grave, obeying the mandate of Nature, Wrapt round in the sweet, cold earth by the kindly general law. Their sons and their sons' sons came, increasing the lore of their fathers; But no kindly Presence came to walk with them over the hills. Slowly, through ages of Time, as the fierce glare of knowledge assails it, Hardly the fair tale can live in the light of our commoner day; But still through the country side runs the fame of the gentle Physicians. The grove of Physician Evan is known in Myddfai to-day. ‚ÄúLlwyn Ifan Feddyg,‚Äù It runs, and another‚Äî‚ÄúLlwyn Meredydd Feddyg.‚Äù Thus, in the old, old tongue, the old, old legend survives. The skill, which through centuries lightened the burden of suffering mortals, Lacked not memorials still in the hearts of the aged and sick; Nay, in fair Brecknock itself, in the church of far-off Llandefallte, Only a century since, were their praises engraved on their tombs. Where is the sceptic would doubt the tale of the mystical mother, If, five centuries after she went, the Meddygon of Myddfai could heal? Or if living men in their youth, on the first fair Sabbath of August, Have thronged from the fair town below to the banks of the mystical lake, Hoping to see its still surface boil sudden, the white herds emerging, And the golden shallop and oar, and the beautiful Presence of old‚Äî Hoping, but hoping in vain, yet in simple belief unshaken, For had they not witnessed her cures of the weak, and the halt, and the blind? But to-day, with its broader light, flouts these beautiful stories romantic. No more these fair visions unearthly are seen on the lakes and the hills. From knowledge alone is strength; but 'tis oh for the fair dreams of old time, The genius which clothed deep truths in fanciful vestures and fair! Not more in the legends of Hellas, than these fair myths of the Cymry, Are grave truths and precious set in a beautiful framework of song. Let them be; they are fair, they are fine, though they wear not their pearl on their foreheads. Let them be; they are flowers of our Race, and as is the flower is the fruit. Not in the savage tales of the Norseman the Cymry delighted‚Äî Tales of blood-stained feasts and rude gods, consumed in a furnace of fire‚Äî But this gentle Physician's story of truth for suffering mortals, Mild wisdom, o'ermastering Fate, young passion, and motherly love. Not wholly your tale shall perish, oh kindly Physicians of Myddfai, Nor the charm of that mystical soul which was born of and lost in the deep; Not wholly, while speech is mine, though the low rays of knowledge shall flout you, And in its broad, pitiless glare you dwindle and vanish away. But still, as I linger and gaze, perusing the exquisite valley, Upward by castle and peak, downward by river and town, Whether from wooded Cystanog, or yew-shaded graves of Llangunnor, Closing the upward gaze, far off lies the mystical steep. Many fair scenes lie between us‚Äîgray Drysllwyn's verdant hillock, Grongar long precious to verse, Dynevor's castle-crowned wood, High perched on its precipice-crags the ruins of grim Cerrigcennen, Or the green vale higher than these, where the fair Towy winds and unwinds. However the gaze ascends, the dark precipice closes the landscape, Beneath whose difficult steep lies the haunted abyss of the lake. Always the story comes back as I gaze, the beautiful legend Which here for long ages of time the wondering peasants believed. In yonder churchyard lie those, who ere they were freed from the body, Grew strong through their poor brief lives by the gift of the Fair of the lake; And, as the sun moves to the West and defines the deep shades of the hollow, I am fired by the fair old tale, till almost I take it for true. III. THE CURSE OF PANTANNAS. 'Mid fair Glamorgan's hills the closeset vales Teem with men's works and toil. The great shafts rise, Belching forth smoke and fire; the labouring beams Of the great engines slowly lift and pause And fall with rhythmic beat. The labouring town Creeps down the winding valley; the poor streets Are deep in inky dust. There comes no sound But children's clamour or the sob or shriek Of the quick-throbbing steam. The men are sunk Beneath the earth, or sleeping weary sleep. Toil, toil, or rest from toil, that is the sum Of those unnumbered lives. Yet are they filled With joys and griefs as are the great on earth, And through the teeming village love and toil Are everywhere; the poor lives come to birth, Grow ripe and are deceased, but never more The face of nature is as 'twas at first. But on the unfenced hillsides, far above, The sounds, the dust, the smoke, come not at all. Still solitude is there, where seldom foot Of weary toil intrudes; the keen cool air Blows fresh and still untainted on the hills; Awhile the dark pines climb aloft, then stay, Like a tired traveller, and naught remains But short sweet grass and thyme and nibbling sheep, And mountain torrents hid in deep ravines, While the swift gaze ranges from vale to vale Masked by its veil of smoke. And, when 'tis night, Immense Auroras, glaring o'er the sky, Mark where amid the folded hillsides lies The City of the Martyr. Here, where still The Cymric lore, the Cymric speech survive, The half-forgotten fables of old time, Of gnome and fairy, flourish undisturbed Amid the noontide glare of common day, And one there is reaped from this very spot And breathing of the race, and it is this:‚Äî Long, long ago, the fair-folk on the earth Were frequent, and their rings upon the meads Showed green wherever virgin pastures were, And o'er the leas their elfin music thrilled Whether of oaten pipe or silvery flute, While the young moon was rising on the hills, And the gay elves footed it merrily Upon the dry smooth turf. So oft they came, Summer and winter, on his sweet short grass, That one grave churl who at Pantannas dwelt, Hating the senseless revel and the race, In anger to the witch who dwelt hard by Revealed his case, demanding if she knew Some potent charm wherewith to free his life From this insensate mirth of godless souls. Then she, knowing his wish and all the lore Of the forbidden books, counselled him thus:‚Äî ‚ÄúWherever on thy pastures shows a ring Which tells of elfin revelry by night, Yoke thy strong oxen, driving straight through them Thy ploughs, till all lie fallow. Sow them thick With kindly corn fit for the use of man, So, when the harvest comes, this tricksy folk, That hates the newer race of mortal men And that which gives them food, will come no more, For chiefly the unsullied meads they love Where never ploughshare came since the old time Ere men were first on earth. So shalt thou gain Great harvests for thy wealth, and shalt disperse This curs√®d people, and shalt reap white wheat Till all thy barns o'erflow, and thou indeed Art lord of thy own lands far more than now. Do thou this thing, and Fortune shall be thine, And peace and the full mastery of thy own.‚Äù So did the churl. He drove his iron ploughs Through the inviolate meads, and straight the sounds Of dance and song grew silent. Never more Came those strange elfin rings upon his fields, Nor any traveller passing saw a glimpse Of those quick-tripping feet; but far away The fair-folk turned, where yet no cruel share Was sent to kill the greensward. Springtide came: The fields grew splendid with the wheat's bright green, When, one day as the sun had kissed the hills, The grave churl, turning homeward, saw a form Upon his path which threatened him, and said, ‚ÄúDaw dial!‚Äù ‚ÄúVengeance comes!‚Äù And in the night, When all was still, there came a noise which shook The house as though 'twould fall, and the same voice, ‚ÄúDaw dial!‚Äù And when now 'twas harvest-tide And the great barns stood open for the grain, One night, no ear nor straw was in the fields, Only black ashes, and the same strange form Met him again, pointing a sword at him, And in the same weird accents, ‚ÄúIt begins,‚Äù ‚ÄúNid yw ond dechreu.‚Äù Then the churl, afraid, Begged for forgiveness, willing that the fields Should turn to meads again, whereon the sprite Promised at last that he would pray his king Forgiveness of the fault, and come again On the third day, bringing his lord's behest. Now, when the third day came, the churl went forth Through his burnt fields, and there again the elf Waited, and to the other made report, ‚ÄúThe king's word is for aye unchangeable, And vengeance must be done. Still, since thy fault Thou dost repent, and hast atoned in part, Therefore, not in thy time, nor of thy sons, Shall the curse fall, but, poised on high, await Thy distant seed.‚Äù Then he, as one who hears Reprieve from death, o'erjoyed sent forth his hinds To turn the corn to pasture. Once again The dark green rings grew frequent on the grass, The gay elves danced, the old melodious sounds Of song and music gladdened all the fields, And he grew rich and passed in peaceful age, And his sons followed him, and slept in peace. But still, when fourscore years or more had fled, The dread voice came at times, repeating still The self-same threat, ‚ÄúDaw dial!‚Äù ‚ÄúVengeance comes!‚Äù Oft heard across the years; but since long use Obscures the sense, so, when this warning came And no harm followed it, the wealthy squire Who held Pantannas then, took little heed Of half-forgotten memories. His young son Rhydderch was come to manhood, and would wed Gwen, daughter of Pencraig, and both their houses Were fain of it. A noble pair were they, In fitted years, and rank, and mutual troth. No cloud came on the sky of their young love, But all men praised the bridegroom's gallant port And the bride's sweetness, and they made a feast At gray Pantannas ere the marriage day, Whereto the fair girl Gwen and all her kin Were bidden. It was the wintry joyous time Of Yule-tide and the birth-time of the Lord, When all hearts, for the sacred season glad, Make merry in the fading of the year. With mirth had sped the feast; all, round the hearth Were seated, Gwen and Rhydderch side by side. Careless they winged the hours with tale and song. The night was still, there came no breath of sound, Only without the loud unceasing fall Of the full river plunging down the rocks, Only within the noise of mirth and song. Then suddenly they seemed to hear a voice Above the roaring stream. A silence fell On all the joyous group. Not as the voice So often heard it came, but seemed to wail Some unremembered word. The maiden clung Close to her lover for a while, and then The jovial hearth, the jest, the tale, the song, Chased all their fears, and all was as before. No sound without but the unceasing noise Of the full river plunging down the rocks. Then, swift again, above the sounds of mirth, Above the river roaring through the rocks, A clear voice, dreadful, pealed, ‚ÄúThe Time is come!‚Äù ‚ÄúDaeth Amser!‚Äù thus it wailed. And all the guests Rose to the door, seeking whence came the voice, And first the goodman went, his worn cheek pale With fear, remembering the tales he heard In boyhood of the voice. Long time they stood Expecting, but no voice they heard, nor sound, But the loud river plunging down the rocks. Till, as they turned them houseward once again, Above the roaring waters, three times heard, The same voice pealed, ‚ÄúThe Time is come! the Time!‚Äù Then they affrighted and in silence went Within the house, and then a mighty noise Crashed round them, and it seemed a mighty hand Shook all to the foundations. As they sate In fear, without a word, a shapeless hag Stood at the casement. Then one, bolder, said, ‚ÄúWhy comest thou, thou loathely thing?‚Äù And she, ‚ÄúPeace, chatterer, I have naught with thee. I come To tell the doom which waits this curs√®d house And that which weds with it. But since thy tongue Is thus injurious, never will I lift The veil that doth conceal it.‚Äù With the word She vanished, none knew whither. When she had gone, And all was still again, the cry, the cry, Rose loud and ceased not. Then a deep affright Fell upon all, and gloom. The hour grew late, And from the hapless house the trembling guests Went on their lonely ways. Rhydderch alone, Grown careless in the flush of innocent love, Delayed his love's departure, till they went Alone at midnight down the haunted vale, Across the roaring waters. Unafraid The lovers fared, nor voice nor shape of ill Assailed them, undismayed, defying all The unseen powers of Death and Doom and Ill, Strong in the virgin mail of mutual love. But when the maid was safe within her home, And it was time to part, some livelier sense Of peril took her, and her boding fear Burst forth in tender words. ‚ÄúDearest,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúGood-night! Farewell! Some sense of coming ill Weighs down my heart. If we should meet no more, Or if some long delay should cheat our love, I will be faithful always, and will wed With thee, and none beside. Ay, though the powers Of ill should part us all our lives and leave me Widowed of thee!‚Äù And he, ‚ÄúFear not, my life, The Power of Love protects us. If I come not At once to claim thee, as indeed I hope, And if the powers of ill have might to part Our lives awhile, yet am I true to thee. It may be some dark ruin waits our house For some forgotten wrong; yet, what care I? They cannot touch our lives, these envious powers, Nor blight our love. What care I for the rest, My treasure, having thee?‚Äù Then, with a kiss, They parted unafraid, and the youth passed The ceaseless voices and the roaring stream Undaunted, clothed with love, and caring naught For things of earth or air. But as he sped Across the self-same fields, which long years past The ploughshare broke, hard by some haunted cave Beneath the hill, a ring of fairy green Before him showed, around him bursts of mirth Came of invisible throats, and silvery so unds Of elfin music sweet; and, rapt in love, And thinking careless of his dear alone, He stepped within the circle, and was lost, While Time should last, to home, and kin, and love. For nowhere might his sorrowing parents find Trace of their son. They searched the country round, Through every grove and brake; they searched the depths Of the loud plunging stream; but never at all They found him. Then, when many weeks had gone, They sought a hermit in his holy cell, And told him all, the wailing cry which rang Through the sad night, the loathely form which came. They told him all, and he, with grief and tears, Knowing what judgment must o'ertake the youth, Though guiltless, bade the mourners hope no more To see him, whether in life he was or death; And they, lamenting him as lost, at last Lived their old life, and all was as before, Till, losing not their sorrow, but bent down By weight of time, they passed, and in the ground Were laid, but never again beheld their son. But Gwen, the gentle maiden, when she knew That which had been, and how her love was gone, Mourned for him long, and long time would lament The cruelty of fate, but never at all Believed that he was dead, for still she held That he would come again‚Äîit might be soon, It might be after years, but still would come, As his word promised. So she dried her tears, Feeding a deathless hope, and every day, Morning and evening, when the circling sun Burst from the gates of dawn, or sank in night, Upon the summit of the scarp√®d rock Would stand, and scan the landscape far and near, Seeking her love's return, and, when he came not, Descend in grief. Year after year she came, Till from love's casements her unfaltering soul Looked dimly, and the gathering snows of time Whitened her chestnut locks, yet still she came, Steadfast, nor failed of hope, while yet she could, Still looking for her love. Until, at last, By the old chapel of the Van, they laid Her mortal body and undying hope. The years slipped by, the undelaying years, And one by one they passed, the young and old Who knew the story; scarcely one was left To tell of Rhydderch or his fate; the world Rolled round upon its course; young lives were born, Grew ripe, and faded; many a youth and maid Came careless, rapt in love, and read the stone Which told of Gwen, nor knew what powers of ill Blighted her life and hope, for never more The elfin music sounded on the leas Since that dread night of Yule. Another race, With other hopes and fears, was on the earth, And the old vanished hopes, and fears, and loves, Were gone, clean gone, like mist upon the hills. Then, one fair summer morning, from the cave Where, on that sad night four score years ago, His footsteps strayed, Rhydderch came forth again In all the pride of youth. His heart beat high With love and hope, nor felt he any change, More than he feels, who, a brief month or more, Leaves his loved home. His longing heart was full; He listened to the joyous notes of song Which the gay thrushes sang, as when he went To meet his love. Slow Nature showed no change, The old oaks seemed the same, his sweetheart's home The same, or hardly changed. The bitter Past Touched him no more, who for the Future looked And recompense of love. There were the graves Beneath the yew, where he in happy tryst Had lingered with his love when moonrise came, As soon he should again. ‚ÄúHe had been ill, Entranced, and the good folk who tended him, He knew not where, made light of the long weeks Which lay 'tween him and health. When he was there 'Twas Yule-tide, now 'twas May.‚Äù He raised his eyes To see if there, where then it used to wait, A girl's form waited. Something gray was there, Half-hidden beneath the yew. Was it herself? He vaulted o'er the wall, and found‚Äîa stone Gray touched by time, and graven on it deep In words half-hid by lichen, the sweet name Of her he loved, ‚ÄúDied, aged three-score years,‚Äù And in some strange year, forty years to come. Then not so much a sense of grief and pain Took him as fear. He knew not what had been; He knew not what he was. His throbbing pulse Grew slower at the chill cold touch of fate, And great perplexity and new-born doubt, And some half-consciousness of long-dead years, As of a dream, enchained him. Soon he thought The mists would vanish, leaving all things clear, And then the love, the passion of his youth Once more would live again. So, eagerly He left the place of graves, and took his way Along the well-known paths, to where he saw, In the old spot‚Äîthe same, yet not the same‚Äî The roof-tree of Pantannas. Not as yet Had he seen human face, and a new fear Came on him, and strange shame, as of one come From other air than earth's; for now he knew That either he was dazed and weak of brain, Or some great change had passed upon his life, Which nothing but the gaze of human eyes And the remembered tones of human speech Might ever again dispel. And so he went Up the old path, and gained the well known door, And in the old room stood again and mused, Changed‚Äîyet the same; but human face or voice He saw not. All the people were afield, Nor was there any there to see or hear Of those he knew of old. Then, when the load Of silence grew too great, through the still house, In his high youthful voice, he called for one, His childish serving boy, who always loved To follow him, whether with horse or hound, All day upon the hills, ‚ÄúIfan, 'tis I, I have come back, ‚ÄòDeuwch yma.‚Äô‚Äù The high voice Through the void space resounding clear, at last Echoed to where, within a sunny nook, Bent double with the weight of ninety years, There dozed an ag√®d man, half deaf, half blind, And when he heard, his limbs began to shake, And he to mutter to himself; again It came, the old man trembled to his feet; The third time came the cry, and then in haste, Tottering, the ag√®d figure, bowed and bent, Moved quickly to the door, and there beheld His long-lost master, fair in youthful bloom, Unchanged, and in his habit as he was When all the world was young. The old man's heart Went out to him, who stood unmoved, untouched, Not knowing whom he saw. One word alone He uttered, ‚ÄúRhydderch.‚Äù And with a flash of light The Past revealed itself. The youth knew all That had been, reading in another's face The unnoted flight of Time. His life was done; He knew it now. All his old longings dead; Dust was his love, and all his yearnings dust; Dust was his life, and all his body dust. No more upon the old earth could he bear To walk amid the light of garish day, And when the white-haired man, with tears of joy, Would fain have kissed his hand, the Life in Death Shrank from the Death in Life, and fading, left Naught but a thin dust, lost in empty air. Thus side by side they move, the Lives of Toil And Fancy. What is Fancy but the Past Or Future, bathed in light which never shone, Or shall, upon the earth, and yet which shows Nearer than real Life, and clearer far‚Äî A Life wherein the terror of the world, Its mystery, its awe, its boundless hope, Are plainer than in ours, wherein the pang Of hopeless longing and unmerited pain Which vex our thought, the blind unequal lot Which takes us, find some vague apology, And hope some dim fulfilment, and the ways Of Fate are justified, the righteous rise, The wicked fall? Die not, oh sacred star Of Fancy! Show us still the charm, the awe, The glamour of our lives, bitterer griefs, Joys keener than our own; loftier heights, Depths deeper still: keep mystery, which is The nurse of knowledge, shading from the glare Of the full noontide sun, our tree of Life! TO A GAY COMPANY. A grassy little knoll I know, Before the windows of my home, Where, when the chill days longer grow, And the slow Spring has come, Forth gleams a golden company Of lowly blossoms through the grass, Smiling a welcome back to me As the soft Spring days pass. Daily they take the cloudless sun; With innocent faces free from guile, And a sweet yearning never done, They look on him and smile. And while he shines, the livelong day, From early morn to failing light, Stands patiently the dense array, Content and smiling bright. But if cold rain or wintry hail Touch them, the careful petals fold, Safe where no violence may assail Their shining cups of gold. Oh, silent, innocent choir! I seem To hear your fairy voices rise, Extolling faint, as in a dream, Your great Lord in the skies; And read in your wide-opened eyes Strange thoughts and human histories, Till from your humble lives seems grown Life fairer than your own. Fair celandines, I love to see Each year your radiant company Bloom golden on the springing grass, As the quick seasons pass. No careless foot shall come to mar Your peaceful lives, while life is mine; Still as the Spring-tide comes shall shine Each multitudinous star, So like the others, and the dead Dear blossoms of forgotten Mays, The joyous Springs which now are fled, The wondering childish days When you, a joyous company, Or yours, were of an age with me; When marvels filled the earth and sky, Nor you could fade, nor I. Still shall I seem to hear your voice Of joyous praise, though all be still; The Spring-time, bidding all rejoice, Through you and me shall thrill. Whether we be alive on earth, Or lying hidden in the mould, The Spring shall come with throes of birth, And clothe the fields with gold. And me, whom the same Maker made, Shall no renewal touch? Shall I Beyond all hope decay and fade? Deeper than Spring-tide lie? Nay, nay! the sun shines overhead, The Spring-tide calls, the winter's done; At last, from close depths dark and dread, I, too, shall greet the Sun. FROM JUVENAL. I read to-day a Poet dead In old Rome, centuries ago; Once more returned the days long fled, The dried-up waters seemed to flow. Once more the keen tongue known in youth Lashed the gross vices of the time, Portraying with a dreadful truth The sloughs of sense, the deeps of crime. Great city of the World! were these All that the race has gained of thee‚Äî Foul lusts and soulless luxuries, Fraud, bloodshed, depths of villany? Was this what we have left of Rome, This blood-stained sink of dark offence? Nay, still across the ages come The high pure tones of innocence: ‚ÄúLet nothing ever, base to see or hear, Pass the chaste threshold where a young soul is; The innocence of boyhood, oh, revere, Lest what of vileness you conceive be his. ‚ÄúDespise not thou his pure and tender youth, But let his weakness stand 'twixt thee and wrong.‚Äù Not wholly wert thou dumb, dread voice of Truth! Nor lost, oh sacred ministry of Song! IGHTHAM MOTE. The gray house from the moat around Rises four-square; two white swans glide; A falling stream's uncertain sound Is heard on every side. A home in an untroubled land, As 'twas at first it is to-day; Unchanged the hushed quadrangles stand, Through centuries past away. The drawbridge and the entrance tower Are still as in those good old days, Ere freedom baffled lawless power, Which dullards love to praise. So old, so gray, so ripe with time‚Äî Ere the broad cedars on the grass Came from some new-discovered clime It saw the centuries pass. So old and yet so new; to-day Flowers of Japan, in gold and white, Its builders dreamt not of, make bright Its gradual decay And rounding into leafy bowers The laurustinus' bulk is spread; A tall tree bending overhead Its delicate wealth of flowers. And over every moss-grown stone A glamour of the dead is cast‚Äî The charm of days deceased and done, The phantoms of the Past. A home, a hundred homes in one, Before our English race grew great, Before the doughty deeds were done Which fixed her glorious fate; Before the dauntless Buccaneer From Devon dared the Western seas, And drove the sullen Don in fear, And robbed his argosies; Before the White Rose and the Red, Ere Crecy proved our England's might, When scarce the Paynim learnt to dread The steel-clad Northern knight. A hundred tales of good and ill, Of love and right, of hate and wrong, The joyance and the dole which fill The treasure-house of song. The old knights with their mail were here, The dames demure with high-built hair, The grave ruffed sage, the cavalier Flaunting his lovelocks fair, The periwigged and powdered Beau, The Dame with hoops and patches brave; The generations come and go‚Äî The cradle and the grave. Our grandsires and our granddames came; They came awhile, their times are dead, And we, the modern sir and dame, Are reigning in their stead. Unchanged the old grange stands, and will When we in turn are past and gone; The hurrying years flit by us still Life glides unnoticed on. And what the end? No Goth or Hun Can blot the record of thy past; Shalt thou, unchanged, untroubled, last Till history be done? The peasants spared thee, the long shock Of warring Roses came not near; The Roundhead and the Cavalier, The King's head on the block, Thou hast survived. Shall peace o'erturn What banded foemen deigned to spare, In some deep hate, when all things fair In one red ruin burn? Or shall a wider faith and trust Bind all, until men recognize No good but mutual sacrifice, Nor aim but to be just? Thou liest within the net of Fate, Oh ancient England of our love! Howe'er the circling world may move. Thou art, thou hast been great! THE SECRET OF THINGS. Did the Race of men descend from a Nature sublime, From a type which is higher than man and almost divine, Sinking from higher to lower through √¶ons of time, Through a hopeless decay and slow unmeasured decline? Whence came, then, this downward force to degrade what God gave? Can we rest in the thought that we fell from a higher estate? Shall the work of His hand grow weaker in time and fade, And that which was once above death, sink down to the grave? And if we are born with the seeds of a deep decay, Can it ever be stayed, though it were by an Infinite Will; Or are all things fated to fade and diminish away Through all stages of lower life till Creation lies still? Or if power there be to stay, and willing for good, Where then shall be set the limit of gradual shame? Not there, maybe, where we think, nor then when we would, And how shall our being reascend to the height whence we came? Or shall this faith rather be ours, that the Infinite Plan Is worked by a gradual miracle bett'ring the Race, Since the quickening Spirit breathed on the sea's dead face, And the faint life stirred, which one day should blossom in Man? It were liker, indeed, to the work of an Infinite Might To raise all the gradual Past from lower to higher; Nay, but where, were it thus, were there room for the heaven-sent light That, 'midst growing darkness shining, could bid us aspire? And what were our profit to rise from the general shame, If we knew that the Race were doomed to a deeper decay, Or if millions of lives that are past should wither in flame, Nor rise from the darkness of Hell to a Heavenly day? And does not all Nature teem, not only with types that ascend, But with those their mysterious fates from a higher ideal degrade, High archetypes dwindling down, which from higher to lower tend, Keen organs, and powers of might, which to feeble energies fade? Great Universe, what is thy Secret, what are thy Laws? Do they dwindle through secular time by the power of an Infinite Will? Or do all things to Perfectness tend by a changeless ordinance still, Impelled by the upward force of an inborn Beneficent Cause? But if such were the law of things, how then should any ignore The self-same embryo growth of man and the lowest ape, Which an inborn necessity moulds to such difference of being and shape, That one rises to godlike discourse, one lies soulless for evermore? Or shall we believe, indeed, that deep down in the covering earth May be found, some day, a trace of a Being that once has been, Which in long-dead √¶ons of time was parent of either birth, And, in Nature's gradual scheme, stood centred and fixed between? Can the Individual rise, though the Race sinks down in disgrace, And, while all is ruined beside, increase to a heavenly height? Can the Individual sink to some dark and forsaken place, While the Race rises higher and higher in face of the Infinite Light? Is the soul of Humanity one with the Individual soul? Shall each rise with the other or sink, as the suns are illumined or fade? Shall the hand of the Maker show weak as the √¶ons unchangeably roll, Grown helpless to stay the wreck of the Cosmos itself hath made? Nay, from out of the House of despair shall be heard a jubilant voice, Beneath the deepest depths and hopeless abysses of Ill, Which in cosmical accents immense, bids all things living rejoice, And out of the pit of Hell strive onward and upward still. OH, EARTH! Oh, earth! that liest still to-night Beneath the starlit skies, How splendid dost thou loom and bright To planetary eyes! But if some storm-cloud, vast and dark, Should hide thee from the day; If through blind night no faintest spark Should force its feeble way, No other would thy face appear, Than on this cloudless sky, Though all the world should quake with fear, Though all our race should die. Great Universe! too vast thou art, Too changeless and too far, Dull grows the brain and chill the heart Before the nearest star. Oh, kindly earth! upon thy breast For ever let me lie, Wrapt round with thy eternal rest, But gazing on the sky. ON A BIRTHDAY. What shall be written of the man Who through life's mingled hopes and fears Touches to-day our little span Of seventy years; Who, with force undiminished still, A Nestor stands among his peers, Full of youth's fire and dauntless will At seventy years; Who knows no creeping chill of age, But, rich in all which life endears, Keeps still the patriot's noble rage Through seventy years, The form unbent, the flashing eye, The curious lore, the wit that cheers, The scorn of wrong which can defy His seventy years; To whom no wound which mars the state, No humblest neighbour's grief or tears, Appeal in vain for love or hate These seventy years; For whom home's happy radiance yet A steadfast beacon-fire appears, Bright through the storms, the stress, the fret Of seventy years;‚Äî What else but this? ‚ÄúBrave heart, be strong, Be of good hope; life holds no fears, Nor death, for him who strives with wrong For seventy years. Live, labour, spread that sacred light Of knowledge which thy soul reveres; Fight still the old victorious fight Of seventy years. Live, labour, ripen to fourscore While still the listening Senate hears; Live till new summers blossom o'er These seventy years. Or if a brighter briefer lot Withdraw thee from thy country's tears, Be sure there is where change is not, Nor age, nor years.‚Äù IN A LABORATORY. A most intelligent dog I took, Affectionate, full of caressing grace, With something of human love in his look, And such a trustful, half-human face. Had learnt tricks, too‚Äîwould give you a paw Where a brother-savant would offer a hand, Right or left, as you asked him; could understand Your speech‚Äîit might almost fill one with awe, Seeing how near to mankind, yet how far These dumb and pitiful creatures are; How all their faith and belief and love Is centred in Man as a Lord above. And looking into his eyes for a while, For knowledge is precious and gained through pain, I bound him down with a pitying smile, And deftly removed the left lobe of his brain. And then, with all that I had of skill, I healed it again, so that presently, Though lame and sick, in his love for me, The creature strove to obey my will. And when I asked him to give me a paw, He gave the left first, but when for the right I asked, his maimed brain failing him quite, Gave the left‚Äîand I thought I had touched a Law. So I persevered, and the brute again, With a loving, sorrowful look of pain, Brought the left paw over the helpless right, And I marked the effort, with deep delight. And having pushed knowledge so far, again I divided the opposite lobe of the brain, And the poor brute, though willing to offer a paw, Could no longer obey‚Äîand I grasped a Law. Later on, still athirst for knowledge, once more I carved the weak brain, as I did before, Till the poor dumb wretch, as he lay on his side, With a loving look regarding me, died. Poor brute! may his pain be for knowledge, and I, If I grasp not the clue, yet I may by-and-by. Strange how weak Man is, and infirm of will, For sometimes I see him and shudder still! THE SUMMONS. March 28, 1884. Away from love of child and wife, From the first flush of ripening life, From books and Art, from all things fair, From homely joys, from public care, A low voice summons us away, And prince and peasant must obey. Sometimes amid the noonday throng, Amid the feast, the dance, the song, Amid the daily wholesome round, The inevitable accents sound, And the ear hears the summons come As his who calls the truant home. And sometimes in the lonely night It sounds and brings with it the light. Alone, with none but strangers nigh, Comes the cold voice which bids us die; Sudden, or after months of pain, And weary vigils spent in vain. What shall it bring of profit then To have loomed large in the eyes of men? Or what of comfort shall endure, Save soaring thoughts and memories pure? Nought else of thoughts and things that be Can solace that great misery. On dreadful summons, full of fear For weakling mortal souls to hear! When that last moment shall be ours, 'Mid failing brain and sinking powers, May one great strength our steps attend, The constant presence of a Friend. SILVERN SPEECH. There are whom Fate's obscure decree Dooms in deep solitude to be; For whom no word that mortal spake The sullen silence comes to break; And e'en the music of the Spheres Falls only on unheeding ears. For them, life's loud processions seem A noiseless and unmeaning dream. Around their prison, joyous life Echoes with noise of fruitful strife. Yet, to their cells no sound may come, But all the universe is dumb. Ah! strange that while all things rejoice Man only should be wanting voice! Ah! strange that morning-song of bird By living ears is never heard! Nor mighty master-music dim, Nor Heaven-thrilled note of soaring hymn, Nor rippling laugh of happy child, Nor the Deep's thunder-voices wild! Unreached by life's tumultuous sound Even as the dead, beneath the ground. And still, though all creation groan, Unmoved in loneliness alone. Ah, cruel fate! unequal doom That sinks the innocent in gloom! What first the depths of chaos stirred But the Ineffable Spoken Word? What else our inmost souls can reach Like that Divinest Gift of Speech? Ah, hapless fate that thus deprives Of half their life unconscious lives! Ah! could a soft compassion gain To soothe the victim's lonely pain! What if with knowledge, love combined, Can wake the undeveloped mind, And without speech or sound can teach The use of sound alike and speech; To those dumb solitudes profound Convey some blessed ghost of sound, And kindle from the dormant sense Bright sparks of new intelligence; Assist the undeveloped brain New loftier summits to attain, Till knowledge grow the guide of love, And love turned Heavenward point above; And the illumined soul confess The innate love of Righteousness! Surely a miracle it is Which works so blest a change as this! THE OBELISK. Upon the river side, Above the turbid stream, Which rolls on, deep and wide; Strange as a dream, The obelisk defies Its dim unnumbered years, Facing the murky skies, Their snows, their tears. Three thousand years it stood Upon the sweet, broad Nile, And watched the gliding flood, The blue skies smile. And many a century more, Where it of old would stand, It lay half covered o'er By the hot sand. Now with signs graven deep, In this our Northern Isle, Where the skies often weep And seldom smile, Once more again it rears Its dim, discrown√®d head, Though all those countless years Its life is dead. Forgotten is the lore Its mystic symbols keep; Its builders evermore Sleep their last sleep. Amid this Northern air, Beyond the storm-tost sea, Where earth nor sky is fair, Why shouldst thou be? Standing amidst the strife, The modern city's roar, Memorial of a life Dead evermore, And of the end of all That shows to-day so strong, The greatness that shall fall, After how long? The city which to-day Shows mightier than thy own, Which yet shall pass away, Like thine o'erthrown. And thou? Where shalt thou be When Time has ruined all, And Faith and Empery Together fall? Shalt thou at last find rest Beneath the river's flow, And mark upon its breast New ages grow? Or shall some unborn race Take thee as prize of war, And set thee up to grace New cities far? Or shall our Northern frost, Our chill and weeping skies. Sap thee, till thou art lost To mortal eyes? The Past it is, the Past Whose ghost thou comest here: The years fleet by us fast, The end draws near. But while the Present flies The far-off Past survives; It lives, it never dies, In newborn lives. It lives, it never dies, And we the outcome are Of countless centuries And ages far. What if our thought might see The Future ere it rise, The ages that shall be, Before our eyes; And if incorporate, Graven by some mystic hand, Our hieroglyph of Fate By thine might stand? Nay, nay, our Future shows Implicitly in thee; For well the thinker knows What was, shall be. And though a ghost thou art, 'Tis well that thou art here To touch each careless heart With hope and fear. A SONG OF EMPIRE. June 20, 1887. First Lady of our English race, In Royal dignity and grace Higher than all in old ancestral blood, But higher still in love of good, And care for ordered Freedom, grown To a great tree where'er In either hemisphere, Its vital seeds are blown; Where'er with every day begun Thy English bugles greet the coming sun! Thy life is England's. All these fifty years Thou from thy lonely Queenly place Hast watched the clouds and sunshine on her face; Hast marked her changing hopes and fears; Her joys and sorrows have been always thine; Always thy quick and Royal sympathy Has gone out swiftly to the humblest home, Wherever grief and pain and suffering come. Therefore it is that we Take thee for head and symbol of our name. For fifty years of reign thou wert the same, Therefore to-day we make our jubilee. Firm set on ancient right, as on thy people's love, Unchecked thy wheels of empire onward move. Not as theirs is thy throne Who, though their hapless subjects groan, Sit selfish, caring not at all, Until the fierce mob surges and they fall, Or the assassin sets the down-trod free. Not such thy fate on this thy jubilee, But love and reverence in the hearts of all. Oh England! Empire wide and great As ever from the shaping hand of fate Did issue on the earth, august, large grown! What were the Empires of the past to thine, The old old Empires ruled by kings divine‚Äî Egypt, Assyria, Rome? What rule was like thine own, Who over all the round world bearest sway? Not those alone who thy commands obey Thy subjects are; but in the boundless West Our grandsires lost, still is thy reign confest. ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äù they call thee, the young People strong, Who, being Britons, might not suffer wrong, But are reknit with us in reverence for thee; Therefore it is we make our jubilee. See what a glorious throng they come, Turned to their ancient home, The children of our England! See What vigorous company Thou sendest, Greater England of the Southern Sea! Thy stately cities, sown with domes and spires, Chase the illumined night with festal fires In honour of their Queen, whose happy reign Began when, 'mid their central roar, The naked savage trod the pathless plain. Thousands of miles, North, South, East, West, to-day, Their countless herds and flocks unnumbered stray. Theirs are the vast prim√¶val forest depths profound; Yet everywhere are found The English laws, the English accents fair, 'Mid burning North or cooler Southern air. A world within themselves, and with them blent Island with continent. The green isles, jewels on the tropic blue, Where flower and tree and bird are strange and new; Or that which lies within a temperate air As summer-England fair; Or those, our Southern Britain that shall be, Set in the lonely sea. Lands of deep fiord and snow-clad soaring hill, Where-through the ocean-currents ebb and fill, And craters vast, from which the prisoned force Of the great earth-fires runs its dreadful course. And vales of fern and palm, whence rising like a dream High in mid-heaven, the ghostly ice-fields gleam. And from her far and wintry North The great Dominion issues forth, Fit nurse of stalwart British hearts and strong; From her black pine woods, deep in snow, Her billowy prairies boundless as the sea, Where on the sweet untroubled soil Yearly the unnoticed, countless wild-flowers blow, And by men's fruitful and compelling toil Yearly the deep and bounteous harvests grow; From the lone plains, o'er which the icy wind Sweeps from the North, leaving the Pole behind; In whose brief summer suns, so fierce they shine, Flourish alike the apple and the vine; From teeming ancient cities bright and fair, Whether in summer's heat or frosty wintry air, Stamped with the nameless charm and grace Of a more joyous race; Or on the rounding prairie nestling down Homestead and frequent new-built town. Even to those ultimate wilds where comes to be Another Westminster on the Pacific Sea. Nor shall thy Western Isles Be wanting, where the high green breakers fall Upon the torrid shore, and nature smiles; And yet sometimes broods over all, Thick woods and hot lagunes with steaming breath, A nameless presence with a face of death. Fair balmy Isles, where never wintry air Ruffles the scentless tropic blossoms fair, Upon whose sun-warmed fruitful soil Our father's dusky freedmen toil. Lands of bright plumes that flash from tree to tree, Long creepers trailing thick with brilliant bloom, And loud upon the forest's silent gloom The plunging surges of the encircling sea. And from the ancient land Scorching beneath the strong unfailing sun, Round thee thy unnumbered subject millions stand; From many a storied city fair, Old ere our England, first begun, From marble tomb and temple white, Built ere our far forefathers were, And still a miracle defying Time; Palaces gray with age and dark with crime, Fierce superstitions, only quenched in blood, And sweet flower-fancies yearning towards the light, And lustral cleansings in the sacred flood, Where by dim temple cool, or shaded street, From hill or parch√®d plain the wayworn pilgrims meet. And from the unhappy Continent Which breeds the savage and the slave‚Äî From our enormous South, there shall be sent A scanty band of strong self-governed men. And from those poisoned swamps, to-day a grave, But which one day shall smile with plenty, when The onward foot of Knowledge, slow, sublime, Has traversed her and set her children free From ocean to her fabulous inland sea, And the fierce savage, full of kingly grace, Is father of a gentler race, And peaceful commerce heals the wounds of Time, And the long history of blood and pain Comes nevermore again. And nearer to thee still, and dearer yet, Thy people of these little Northern Isles, Who never shall their Queen forget, Nor be forgotten, whether Fortune smiles Or arm√®d Europe storm around, Whom none assail, beyond the waves' deep sound, Behind their surge-struck ramparts safe and free. These are thy closest subjects, these The brain and heart of Empire, as thy Rose Within its close-ranged petals comes to hold A perfumed heart of gold, Wherein the seed of the miraculous flower, Safe hid, defies Fate's power. And most of all thy wondrous mother-town Upon our broad Thames sitting like a crown, Who, 'mid her healthful labour-laden air, Grows every day more fair: Whom not for fairness do her children prize, But for her gracious homely memories‚Äî A nation, not a city, the loved home Whereto the longing thoughts of exiled Britons come! What is it that their voices tell? What is it that in naming thee they praise? Not wider empire only; that is well.‚Äî But there are worthier triumphs, peaceful days, Just laws, a people happier than before, And rolling on untroubled evermore, With larger stream, and fuller and more free The tide of ordered liberty. These things than empire higher are, Higher and nobler far. Our old Draconic Law With children's blood cemented, no more kills Its tale of innocent victims. Pitying Love Amid the abjects deigns to-day to move Whom no man cared for. If the cruel city Still claims its thousands, by the out-casts stand Pure men and women in a gentle band, Linked in a ministry of Love and Pity. No more the insensate State Binds down the worker, to exaggerate The unequal gifts of Fate, But comes instead, some care for common good, Some glimmering sense of growing brotherhood. No more half deafened by the unresting loom, Soulless as is the brute, the pallid children pine; Nor hapless slaves, half naked, 'mid the gloom And grime and squalor of the sunless mine, The young girl-workers coarsen, but all take Some modest gleam of knowledge, which may breed The faith that is above, yet under, every creed, And of these humble lives, one day shall make True citizens indeed. Nor shall thy peoples' voice Keep silence of the salutary change Which brought the gift of fullest freedom down To humble lives, whether by field or town; The potent gift, and strange, Which wakes alone the wider civic sense, Which, more than knowledge, sobers heart and mind, And rich and poor in closer ties can bind, And knits a nation firm in harmony! Let civil broils and fiercer dissidence Come‚Äîwe are one. What care have we? In speech, in action, we are free. No mob law need we fear, or senseless anarchy, And for all these rejoice. What law for us has done, For all our greater England 'neath the sun, Let us do now, building on high a State Of half the World confederate! Sure, 'twere the noblest victory of mind Thy scattered realms to bind; To guide the toiling, hopeless feet To where is work for all, and life is sweet; To teach our millions their great heritage, To call together high world-councils sage, Strong as the Priest's, in this our island-home; Then, though the arm√®d world shall come, What care, what fear, have we, Who, being free, are one; and, being one, are free? If all the wide Earth brings our millions food, And if our navies whiten every sea, If we have rest and wider brotherhood, All these began with thee; And shall, if Heaven so will, still more increase With thy remaining years, till bless√®d Peace, Half frighted from us now by grave alarms Of half a world in arms, Shall brood, a white-winged Angel, o'er the Earth. Then may the rule of Wrong be done! Then may a new and Glorious Sun Gild the illumined World! and then Come Righteousness to men! Three sovereigns of our English line Have reached thy length of rule, each of his name the third, But never England's heart was stirred By those as 'tis by thine. Our Henry died lonely and girt with foes; Our greater Edward fell in dotage ere life's close; And he thy grandsire knew a troublous time, A dim pathetic figure! full of pain And care too great for mortal to sustain, And in his rayless sorrow grown sublime! Three Queens have swayed Our England's fortunes‚Äîgreat Elizabeth. In whose brave times the blast of war Blew loud and fierce and far. Her dauntless sailors dared the unbounded West, And fought the Armada's might, and did prevail, And wheresoe'er was seen an English sail Her Empire was confest; And round her gracious throne immortal flowers of song Bloomed beautiful, bloomed long, And left our English tongue as sweet as it was strong. And when a century and more had passed In blood and turmoil, came a Queen at last. Her soldiers and her sailors once again Conquered on tented field and on the main, And once more rose the choir of song; Not as the Elizabethan, deep and strong, But, tripping lightly on its jewelled feet, Issued politely sweet, And Shakespeare's tongue and Milton's learned to dance The minuet of France. And now again once more A Queen reigns o'er us as before; Again by land and sea We cast the chequered sum of victory. Once more our English tongue Wakes to unnumbered bursts of song. A great choir lifts again its accents fair, And to those greater singers, if we find To-day no answering mind, 'Tis that too large the Present fills the view, Yet has its great names too. Part of the glorious fellowship are we, The great Victorian company, Which, since old C√¶dmon's deep voice carolled strong, Through England's chequered story bore along The high pure fire of the world's sweetest song. But not in the increase Of Empire, or the victories of peace, Chiefly we seek thy praise. But that thy long and gracious days, Lived in the solitude that hems a throne, Since thy great sorrow came and left thee lone, Were ever white, and free from thought of blame. Not once in thy long years shadow of envy came On thee, or him, whose stainless man hood bore Thy love's unfading flower. Never before In all our England was a royal home Whereto the loving thoughts of humble hearts might come. Thy children's children stand around thy knees, Their children come in turn as fair as these; Thy people and thy children turn to thee, Knit all in one by bonds of sympathy With thee, our Queen, are we; Therefore we make our solemn jubilee! Flash, festal fires, high on the joyous air! Clash, joy-bells! joy-guns, roar! and, jubilant trumpets, blare! Let the great noise of our rejoicing rise! Gleam, long-illumined cities, to the skies Round all the earth, in every clime, So far your distance half confuses time! As in the old Jud√¶an history, Fling wide the doors and set the prisoners free! Wherever England is o'er all the world, Fly, banner of Royal England, stream unfurled! The proudest Empire that has been, to-day Rejoices and makes solemn jubilee. For England! England! we our voices raise! Our England! England! England! in our Queen we praise! We love not war, but only peace, Yet never shall our England's power decrease! Whoever guides our helm of State, Let all men know it, England shall be great! We hold a vaster Empire than has been! Nigh half the race of man is subject to our Queen! Nigh half the wide, wide earth is ours in fee! And where her rule comes, all are free. And therefore 'tis, oh Queen, that we, Knit fast in bonds of temperate liberty, Rejoice to-day, and make our solemn jubilee! TEMPERANCE. Whoso can rule his soul In prudence still; Who can his heart control, His thought, his will; Whom, temperate in all, Labour and play, No low desires enthral Nor lead astray; Seeking the golden mean, To Duty vowed,‚Äî Ay, though black depths between Roar dark and loud; He shall new pleasures find, More fruitful far Than for the undisciplined And sensual are; A kingdom absolute, A wider sway Than his whom myriads mute And blind obey. For in his soul one voice Alone is heard, Which bids his being rejoice, One perfect word, Stronger than heated youth, Mightier than wrong‚Äî The Godlike voice of Truth, A constant song. Silence all discords loud Within the breast! Fly from the troubled crowd To peace and rest! And let the enfranchised soul, From self set free, Find in Right's dread control True Liberty! THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE. An Ode. (July 4, 1887.) With soaring voice and solemn music sing! High to Heaven's gate let pealing trumpets ring! To-day our hands consolidate The Empire of a thousand years: Delusive hopes, distracting fears, Have passed and left her great. For Britain, Britain, we our jubilant anthems raise. Uplift your voices all: worthy is she of praise! Our Britain, issuing at the call of Fate From her lone islets in the Northern Sea, Donned her Imperial robe, assumed her crown√®d state, Took the sole sceptre of the Free; 'Mid clang of arms her crescent glory rose, By shattered fleet and flaming town: Victorious at the last o'er all her foes, Embattled rolls her splendid story down. Soldier and seaman, side by side, Her strong sons, greatly dared and bravely died. Close on their steps her dauntless toilers went O'er unknown sea and pathless continent, Till when the centuries of strife were done They left the greatest Realm beneath the sun. Praise them and her; your grateful voices raise. Mother of Freedom! thou art worthy of our praise! No more we seek our Realm's increase By War's red rapine, but by white-winged Peace; To-day we seek to bind in one, Till all our Britain's work be done‚Äî Through wider knowledge closer grown, As each fair sister by the rest is known, Through mutual Commerce, mighty to efface The envious bars of Time and Place, Deep-pulsing from a common heart And through a common speech expressed,‚Äî From North to South, from East to West, Our great World Empire's every part; A universal Britain, strong To raise up Right and beat down Wrong. Let this thing be! who shall our Realm divide? Ever we stand together, Kinsmen, side by side! To-day we would make free Our millions of their glorious heritage. Here, Labour crowds in hopeless misery,‚Äî There, is unbounded work and ready wage. The salt breeze, calling, stirs our Northern blood,‚Äî Lead we the toilers to their certain good; Guide we their feet to where Is spread for those who dare A happier Britain 'neath an ampler air. Uprise, O Palace fair! With ordered knowledge of each faroff land For all to understand! Uprise, O Palace fair, where for the Poor shall be Wise thought and love to guide o'er the dividing sea! First Lady of our British race! 'Tis well that with thy peaceful Jubilee This glorious dream begins to be. This thy lost consort would; this would thy son, Who has seen all thy Empire face to face And fain would leave it One. Oh, may the Hand which rules our Fate Keep this our Britain great! We cannot tell, we can but pray Heaven's blessing on our work to-day. Uprise, O Palace fair, where every eye may see This proud embodied Unity! For Britain and our Queen one voice we raise,‚Äî Laud them, rejoice, peal forth: worthy are they of praise! DAVID GWYN. David Gwyn was a Briton bold who pined a slave in the hulks of Spain, Taken years since in some mad emprise with Francis Drake on the Spanish main. Long in that cruel country he shared the captive's bitter and hapless lot; Slowly the dead years passed and left him dreaming still of the days that were not, Of tiny Radnor, or stately Brecknock, or Cardigan's rain-swept heights may be, Or green Caermarthen, or rich Glamorgan, or Pembroke sitting on either sea. Sickening within his squalid prison, while still as the circling seasons came The fierce sun beat on the brown Sierras, springtide and summer and autumn the same, Almost hope failed the dauntless sailor, chained in an alien and hateful land, Lonely and friendless, starved and buffeted, none to pity or understand, Pining always and ageing yearly as slow Time whitened and bowed his head, While longing and hate burned high and higher as life sank lower and hope fell dead, With brutes for his gaolers, and felons for comrades, bound to him constantly night and day, Eleven summers, eleven winters wasted their wearisome length away. Then there awoke round his floating prison clang of hammers and bustle of men, Shipwrights labouring late and early stirred old hopes in his heart again. ‚ÄúSpain will lay waste your heretic island with fire and sword ere the winter be come, And you and the rest of your felon crew shall row the galleys which sack your home.‚Äù The hot blood flushed to the prisoner's forehead, but never a word in reply said he, Toiling obediently days and weeks till the great fleet sailed on the summer sea, Splendid galleons to wering skyward with gilded masts and with streamers brave, Floating proudly to martial music over the blue Lusitanian wave, Four great galleys leading the van, and in one midst the close-thronged benches sate David Gwyn, a forgotten oarsman, nursing a burning heart of hate. So along the windless ocean slow the great Armada sped, Two unclouded weeks of summer blazed the hot sun overhead. Hourly from the high deck-pulpits preaching rose and chant and prayer, And the cloying fumes of incense on the brisk Atlantic air; Courtiers fine and sea-worn sailors jesting the slow hours away, Silken sails and blazoned standards flapping idly day by day, And within his high poop-turret, more than mortal to behold, The High Admiral Medina lounging idly, clothed with gold: Not a thought of peril touched them, not a dream of what might come, Proudly sailing, sure of conquest, with the benison of Rome, And far down among the oarsmen's benches, fainting, desperate, David Gwyn, a patriot helpless with a burning heart of hate. With the roaring Bay of Biscay louder winds and greyer skies, And the galleons plunge and labour, and the rolling mountains rise; Blacker loom the drifting storm-clouds, fiercer grow the wind and sea, Far and wide the galleons scatter, driving, drifting helplessly. Higher mount the thundering surges; tossed to heaven, or fathoms down. Rear or plunge the cumbrous galleys while the helpless oarsmen drown. Like a diver the Diana slides head first beneath the wave, Not a soul of all her hundreds may her labouring consorts save. Now to larboard, now to starboard, shattered, tost from side to side, Helpless rolls the great Armada, shorn of all its pomp and pride. Down between those toppling ridges, groaning, straining in his place, David Gwyn among the oarsmen sits with triumph in his face. Then amid the roaring seas, when hope was gone and death was near, And the hearts of all the Spaniards sinking, failing them for fear, Boldly to the haughty Captain, David Gwyn the oarsman went, Veiling with a fearless frankness all the depth of his intent. ‚ÄúQuick, Se√±or! the ship is sinking; like her consort will she be, Buried soon with slaves and freemen, fathoms deep beneath the sea. Give me leave and I will save her; I have fought the winds before, Fought and conquered storms and foemen many a time on sea and shore.‚Äù And the haughty Captain, knowing David Gwyn a seaman bold, Since upon the Spanish main the foemen sailed and fought of old, Answered, turning to his prisoner: ‚ÄúSave the ship, and thou shalt gain Freedom from thy life-long fetters, guerdon from the Lord of Spain.‚Äù Then from out the prisoner's eye there flashed a sudden gleam of flame, And a light of secret triumph o'er his clouded visage came, Thinking of his Cymric homestead and the fair years that were gone, And his glory who should save her from the thraldom of the Don. ‚ÄúI will save your ship,‚Äù he answered; ‚Äútrust me wholly, have no fear: Pack the soldiers under hatches; leave the main deck free and clear.‚Äù Doubting much the Don consented; only, lest the slaves should rise, By each oarsman sat a soldier, watching him with jealous eyes. Little knew he of the cunning, secret signs, and watch words born Of long years of cruel fetters, stripes and hunger, spite and scorn. Little thought he every prisoner as in misery he sate Hid a dagger in his waistband, waiting for the call of Fate. David Gwyn, the valiant seaman, long time battled with the main, Till the furious storm-wind slackened and the ship was safe again. Till then he gave the signal, raised his arm and bared his head. Every oarsman rising swiftly stabbed his hapless warder dead, Seized his arms, and, fired with conquest, mad with vengeance, like a flood On the crowded 'tween-decks bursting, left the Spaniards in their blood. David Gwyn was now the Captain, and the great ship all his own; Well the slaves obeyed their comrade, thus to sudden greatness grown. Straight for France the stout Vasana shaping, lo upon her lee Don Diego in the Royal, foaming through the stricken sea, Driven by full four hundred oarsmen, nigh the monstrous galley came. Then from out her thundering broadside swift as lightning burst the flame In among Gwyn's thronging seamen straight the hurtling missiles sped; Nine strong sailors in a moment lay around their Captain dead. David Gwyn, the dauntless Captain, turning to his comrades then‚Äî ‚ÄúGod has given you freedom; earn it: fear not; quit yourselves like men. Lay the ship aboard the Royal: free your comrades and be free.‚Äù The strong oarsmen bent, obedient, rowing swiftly, silently, Till, as if in middle ocean striking on a hidden rock, All the stout Vasana's timbers, quivering, reeling with the shock, Straight on board the crowded Royal leapt that band of desperate men, Freed the slaves, and left no Spaniard who might tell the tale again; And the sister galleys stately with fair winds sped safely on, Under David Gwyn, their Captain, and cast anchor at Bayonne; And King Henry gave them largesse, and they parted every one Free once more to his own country, and their evil days were done. David Gwyn to England coming won the favour of the Queen; Well her Grace esteemed his valour in the perils that had been. What! had those swift, mighty galleys, which could wind and tide defy, Winged with speed the slow Armada when our weak fleet hovered by? Had not then that sullen quarry, ploughing helpless on the plain, Turned and crushed the nimble hunters, and rewrit the fate of Spain? Who shall tell? But his were doughty deeds and worthy lasting fame, Though the country he delivered never yet has known his name. Did he seek again the home of his youth, did he let the years go peacefully by, Breathing the sweet clear air of the hills, till his day was done and he came to die? By tiny Radnor, or stately Brecknock, or Cardigan's rain-swept heights may be, Or green Caermarthen, or rich Glamorgan, or Pembroke sitting on either sea? Did he dream sometimes 'mid the nights of storm of those long-dead years in the hulks of Spain, That stealthy onset, that dread revenge, with the wild winds drowning the cries of pain? Did the old man shudder to think of the blood, when the knife pierced deep to the Spaniard's heart? Nay, to each of us all is his Life assigned, his Work, his Fate, his allotted Part. SONG. [Farewell! farewell! Adown the ways of night] Farewell! farewell! Adown the ways of night The red sun sinks, and with him takes the light; O'er the dull East the gathering shadows grow, And turn to gray the Western afterglow. Farewell! farewell! But Day shall come again; Shall hope then die, and prayers be breathed in vain? Our faithful hopes outlive the fleeting day; Stronger than Life and Death and Time are they. Ah! see the last faint ray has ceased to flame. Courage! our parted souls are still the same. Round is the earth, and round the estranging sea, And Time's swift wheel which brings thee back to me. Come back! Come back climbing the Eastern sky! Our souls are deathless though our flesh shall die. Winged are our thoughts, and flash forth swift and far Beyond the faint light of the furthest star. Come back! or if we meet in some strange place, On some dim planet, I shall know thy face; By some weird land, or unimagined sea, I shall not be afraid, dear, having thee. THE ALBATROSS. Upon the lone Australian shore, A chance-sent traveller's careless eye, Saw a white bird swoop down and lie With wide wings that should soar no more. A feeble quiver shook the bird, A film the glazing eye o'erspread; Once more the pearly plumage stirred, And then the Albatross was dead. He spread the giant pinions wide, When 'neath the snowy down he found By hands unknown securely bound, A sea-worn missive safe and sound. And when the blotted page he read, This message bore it from the sea‚Äî ‚ÄúFive shipwrecked sailors, mourned as dead, A thousand miles from land are we; ‚ÄúWhoe'er thou art whose hand shall take Our poor winged messenger, we pray That thou wilt spare him for our sake, And send him scatheless on his way. ‚ÄúHardly we hope our words shall find Response, save by some blessed chance; Good friend who readest this be kind, And speed us to our well-loved France.‚Äù The traveller stood and musing read, Some new-born pity filled his breast, Seeing that poor envoy lie at rest, The living speaking thro' the dead. And soon to save those helpless men, A stout ship, many a weary mile Sailed forth, and found their lonely isle, And sped them to their homes again. But I, as o'er this tale I stay My wandering fancy, seem to hear, A voice which comes my heart to cheer, A silent voice which seems to say, ‚ÄúThus is it with the world around, For tho' the messenger be gone, Some winged thought with his being bound, O'er all the world goes echoing on. ‚ÄúAnd though its tones sound faint and weak, Drowned by the rude world's clamorous strife, The message of dead lips can speak To souls in prison, words of life!‚Äù IN A GREAT LADY'S ALBUM. Flit softly, Muse, on hesitating wing, Through this fair pleasaunce, vowed to Prince and King. Here, ranged apart, as in some leafy glade, Monarchs and statesmen court the grateful shade; Poets and warriors side by side are found, And the grove echoes with harmonious sound. Science, with steady gaze and tranquil eye, And Faith triumphant soaring to the sky, The immemorial East delights to bring Its tribute to the clear Castalian spring. Where'er we stray some nobler foot has trod, And the awed gazer knows a demigod. Dreadst thou with daring pinion to invade The solitudes for finer natures made? Nay, halt not! Spread thy wings and raise thy song! Better the feebly right than basely strong? Thou, too, art like to these, and with them one In nature, as the star is with the Sun. Here whoso greatly daring enters in, This truth shall learn, ‚Äúthe whole wide world is kin.‚Äù From Prince to boor, old East, and larger West, One Truth, one Right, one Wisdom is confest; One hate of Wrong, one love of nobler Thought; One reverence for the universal Ought; One worship of the one pervading Name, Through varying voices heard and yet the same! ON A SILVER WEDDING. March 10, 1888. The rapid tide of gliding years Flows gently by this Royal home, Unvexed by clouds of grief and tears Its tranquil seasons come. To one, as happy and more great, Came earlier far, the dread alarm, The swift immedicable harm, The icy voice of Fate. The gracious father of his race Heard it, too soon, and dared the night; Death coming found him with the light Of Sunshine on his face. He left his widowed Queen to move Alone in solitary sway, Alone, through her long after-day, But for her people's love. Their saintly daughter, sweet and mild, Drew poison from her darling's breath; Their young son trod the paths of death Far, far from love and child. Nay, now by the Ausonian sea, Daughter of England, good and wise! Thou watchest, with sad anxious eyes, Thy flower of chivalry! But this fair English home no shade Of deeper sorrow comes to blot, No grief for dear ones who are not, Nor voids which years have made. One sickness only, when its head Lay long weeks, wrestling sore with death, And pitying England held her breath Despairing, round his bed No regal house of crown√®d state, Nor lonely as the homes of kings Where the slow hours on leaden wings Oppress the friendless great. But lit with dance and song and mirth, And graceful Art, and thought to raise, Crushed down by long laborious days, The toiler from the earth. Its Lord an English noble, strong For public cares, for homely joys, A Prince among the courtly throng, A brother with his boys. Who his Sire's footsteps loves to tread, In prudent schemes for popular good; And strives to raise the multitude, Remembering the dead. And having seen how far and wide Flies England's flag, by land and sea, Would bind in willing unity Her strong sons side by side. Its gentle mistress, fair and sweet, A girlish mother, clothed with grace, With only summer on her face, Howe'er the swift years fleet. Who was the Vision of our youth, Who is the Exemplar of our prime, Sweet Lady, breathing Love and Truth, With charms which vanquish Time. Good sons in flowering manhood free, Girls fair in budding womanhood, An English household bright and good, A thousand such there be! Great Heaven, how brief our Summers show! And fleeting as the flying Spring! The almonds blush, the throstles sing, The vernal wind-flowers blow. And yet 'tis five-and-twenty years, Since those March violets dewy-sweet, Were strewn before the maiden's feet, Amidst a people's cheers. And mile on mile the acclaiming crowd Surged round her, as the soft Spring air With joy-bells reeled, and everywhere Roared welcome deep and loud. While this, our trivial life to-day, Loomed a dim perilous landscape strange, Hid by thick mists of Time and Change, Unnumbered leagues away. Long years! long years! and yet how nigh The dead Past shows, and still how far The Future's hidden glimpses are From mortal brain and eye. What secrets here shall Time unfold? What fates befall this gracious home? Shall to-day's festal once more come, Ripened with time to gold? Heaven send it! Close-knit hearts are here, Not that old hate of sire and heir; Here flourish homely virtues fair, And love that conquers fear. For these may Fortune grant again Their Sovereign's large and blameless life, Unmarred by care, undimmed by strife, Less touched than Hers by pain! High set above the noise and dust Of Faction, and contented still To guide aright the popular will, By sympathy and trust! Through civic wisdom temperate, And forethought for the general need, Keeping midst change of politic creed, A Throne, a People great! THE INVINCIBLE ARMADA, 1588. 'Tis a fair eve at midsummer, three hundred years ago, Drake and his bold sea captains all are out on Plymouth Hoe; They are busy at bowls, brave gentlemen, with jovial mirth and jest, When watching eyes spy far away a sail upon the West. A sail! ten sail! a hundred sail! nay nigh two hundred strong! And up the sea they swiftly climb in battle order long; Their high main-royals rake the skies, as in a crescent wide, Like a thick wood, full seven miles broad, they sail on side by side. There is swift alarm and hurry then, but never a thought of fear, As the seamen, with the falling night, behold the Don draw near. ‚ÄúRing out the bells,‚Äù cries Hawkins, and across the darkling main, England peals out defiance to the gathered hosts of Spain. They do not fear the Don, not they, who on the Spanish main, Have fought his might and lowered his pride, again and yet again; And yet 'tis fearful odds they face, when they sail forth to meet, Spain and her great Armada with the puny English fleet. And the streets grow thronged with seamen, and the crowds begin to shout, And quick oars dash and sails are set, before the stars come out. They weigh their anchors with a will, and out they speed to sea, Where up the Channel, stately, slowly, forge the enemy. Now St. George for merry England, and St. James for Papal Spain, Our seamen are our chiefest hope, nor shall we trust in vain. We have quenched the fires of Smithfield, and no more, 'fore God, we swear, Shall they ever again flame upward, through our sweet, free, English air. Now when they neared the foeman, as he loomed across the sea, Lord Howard led the English van, a Catholic Lord was he, And his great Ark Royal thundered out her broadsides loud and long, With Drake and Frobisher hard by, and heroes in a throng. But never a gun the Spaniards fired, but silent ploughed and slow, As bisons in a sullen herd across the prairies go; And behind them close, like hunters swift, with hounds that snarl and bite, The English squadrons followed through the breezy summer night. They could see the Dons' high lanterns, in a brilliant crescent flare, They could catch the Black Friars' moaning chant upon the midnight air. All night they pressed them close, and ere the sun began to flame, Long miles away, by blue Torbay, the warring galleons came. Soon as the dawn began to glow, the guns began to roar, All day the thundering navies fought along the Dorset shore, Till Portland frowned before them, in the distance dark and grim, And again the night stole downward, and the ghostly cliffs grew dim. And already, praised be God, who guides the patriots' noble strife, Though not an English flag is lost, and scarce an English life, De Valdez yields his ship and sword, and into Weymouth Bay, They tow Oquenda's burning bark, the galleon of Biscay. Day fades in night, 'mid stress of fight, and when to waking eyes, Freshwater's ghostly sea cliffs, and the storm-worn Needles rise, From a score of sheltered inlets on the smiling Solent sea, England comes forth to aid her sons, with all her chivalry. There sails my Lord of Cumberland, and he of Oxford too, Brave Raleigh and Northumberland, and Grenville and Carew. As to a field of honour hasten knights of deathless fame, To meet the blue blood of Castile, the flower of England came. Then with the wind, the foe faced round, and hissing o'er the blue, Forth from his lofty broadsides vast his hurtling missiles flew; Long time the fight confusedly raged, each man for his own hand; St. George! protect our country, and the freedom of our land! See here round brave Ricaldes thick the English levies press! See there the keels from London town, hemmed round and in distress! Such thunder sure upon the seas was never heard before, As the great ordnance smite the skies with one unceasing roar! Now when the fifth day of the fight was come, St. James's Day, The sea was like a sheet of glass, the wind had died away, And from out the smoke clouds looming vast, churning the deep to foam, Driven by three hundred oars the towering galliasses come. But ere they neared the English line, a furious iron hail Of chain-shot and of grape-shot crashed through mast and oar and sail; No more they could, they turned and fled, upon our English sea, Not yet such furious hatred raged, or stubborn bravery. And upon the steep white walls of cliff and by the yellow sand, With pike and musket hurrying down the sturdy peasants stand, And the trembling women kneel and call upon the Holy name, And watch the thick black cloud which bursts in murderous jets of flame. Now St. George for our old England! for the Don has turned and fled, With many a strong ship sunk or burnt, and gallant seaman dead, And by the last day of the week, the warring squadrons lie, The foeman moored in Calais roads, the English watching by. They sent for aid to Parma, for they were sore beset, But the Duke was at St. Mary's shrine, and could not succour yet, For by Nieuport and by Dunkirk, stern, immovable as Fate, With stalwart ships, and ordnance strong, the Dutchmen guard the gate. Now that great Sabbath dawns at last, and from the foeman's fleet, The deep mass-music rises, and the incense sickly-sweet, And beneath the flag of England, stern, with dauntless hearts and high, The seamen take the bread and wine, and rise prepared to die. Then came Lord Henry Seymour, with a message from Her Grace, And Sir Francis read the missive with grave triumph on his face, And he sware an oath, that come what would, her orders should be done Before the early rose of dawn proclaimed the coming sun. And the summer daylight faded, and 'twas midnight on the wave, And among the close-moored galleons, all was silent as the grave, And the bright poop lanterns rose and fell with the breathing of the deep, And silent rode the towering hulls, with the weary crews asleep. When two brave men of Devon, for Sir Francis bade them go, With all sail set before the wind, stole down upon the foe; And before the drowsy watchmen woke, the swift destruction came, As with a blaze of wildfire leapt the fireships into flame! Then from the close-thronged ships of Spain loud cries of terror rise, As from their burning ranks the glare flares upward to the skies, With cables cut, and sails half set, they drift into the night, And many are crushed, and many burn, and some are sunk outright. And the watchers on the Dover Cliffs know well what thing has been, And for noble England cheer aloud, and for her Maiden Queen. No more, no more, great England, shalt thou bow thy head again Beneath the Holy Office and the tyranny of Spain! And the conquering English followed, and upon the Flanders shore, Hopeless the shattered galleons fought, till fight they could no more. And some went down with all their crews, and some beat helplessly Upon the yeasty quicksands of the perilous Northern Sea. Then Sidonia with the remnant, shattered ships and wounded men, Fled northward, with the foe in chase, hoping for Spain again; But by the Orkneys, lo! the Lord blew with a mighty wind, And on the cruel Irish West they left two score behind. And the savage kerns of Desmond, when the stormy winds were o'er, Robbed the thronged corpses of the great, upon the lonely shore. There, in his gold-laced satins, lay the Prince of Ascul√®, 'Mid friars, and seamen drowned and dead, and Dons of high degree. Or faint with hunger and with thirst, though rescued from the wave, The haughty Spaniards knew in turn the misery of the slave. They ate the captives' bitter bread, they who brief weeks ago Sailed forth in high disdain and pride to lay our England low. And the scattered remnant labouring back to Spain and life again, Left fourscore gallant ships behind and twice ten thousand men; And when in dole and misery this great emprise was done, There was scarce a palace in all Castile which did not mourn a son. Let not their land forget the men who fought so good a fight! Still shall our England keep undimmed their fame, their memory bright. And if again the foemen come in power upon the main, May she find sons as strong as those who broke the might of Spain! ODE SUNG AT THE FIRST COOPERATIVE FESTIVAL. August 17, 1888. Come let us sing together a new song, The triumph of the weak made strong; The victories of peace we celebrate, Not those of war and hate. The victories of peace, won after many days: Let us our voices tune to joy and praise; Come let us sing a new and happy song! Time was when by his too-great toil bowed down, The worker feared his master's frown; For some scant wage chained to his hopeless task, Nor ever dared to ask For his young lives and piteous gains afraid, A fitting share of that his hands had made; But now through union strong, the workers claim their own. There is red war not fought with sword or gun, Where, in deep peace, war's wrong is done; Where face to face in hostile camps they stand Who should clasp hand with hand: The rich man waning slow in soulless ease, The poor man spent by toils and miseries. Sing we a cheerful song, Time's curse is almost done. Ay, almost done, but ah! not wholly yet; Let not too sanguine souls forget Those for whom no man taketh thought or heed, The hearts, the lives that bleed. Let not our workers, strong in brotherhood, Forget the friendless toiler's starving brood. Mixt be our song with joy, yet not all cheerful yet. Yet for to-day, at least, let us rejoice, Uplifting jubilant heart and voice. Not what has been we hymn, but what shall be; Not the old misery, But the new days when Man beneath the power Of peaceful union blooms a perfect flower‚Äî For this we choose not sorrow, but rejoice. We come to-day in this our solemn mirth, Bringing the flowers, the fruits, of earth, Reared by strong hands which labour glorifies. Toil, honest toil we prize‚Äî Look round and see how rich the harvest grows, The mellow fruits, the perfumed rose that glows Raised by untiring toil from our good mother Earth. See how to-day the long drawn vistas fill With fruit of every toiler's skill, The man's strong gains, the woman's deft and fine; Here heart and brain combine In pitying succour for the weak and dumb; Here are fair schemes, to build the happy home, And children's work, and play, than work more precious still. Therefore do we make merry and are glad; No care to-day shall make us sad. We sing the song of wider brotherhood, Knit close for general good. We sing the higher social sense which binds Each for the general good, opposing minds. We hail thee, blessed Union, and are glad! And sing aloud together a new and cheerful song! TO JOHN BRIGHT. MARCH 27, 1889. Friend of the friendless else, and art thou dead? Great Master of our vigorous Saxon speech, Unwearied pleader for the people's bread, Hater of war, strong to convince and teach, With passionate faith and indignation strong, Mighty to slay the hydra-heads of wrong. Thy voice was aye for Freedom, and thy heart Warlike for Peace, since o'er the open grave Of thy young love, thou didst accept thy part To strike the shameful fetters from the slave, To lift the toiler from his hopeless lot, To plant the civic sense where it was not. Thy soul was reared on fitting food; thy tongue, Touched with our older England's purest fire; The noblest strains our Island Muse has sung, Shakspeare and Milton did thy speech inspire; The poets taught thy rhythmic periods strong; And thy impetuous flights were winged with song. Thou couldst not brook the faithless souls that dread To follow Right and leave the rest to God; No selfish fear of careless riches bred Might turn thee from the path by Duty trod. England thou lovedst, and beyond set of sun A greater England still, and both made one! Thy friend and comrade went his way alone; Long years ago God called him, and he went. To him thy speech has reared, than sculptured stone, A statelier and more lasting monument. Long time were ye reviled, scorned, hated; now A people's homage crowns each reverend brow. Champion of Freedom, by thy hearse shall I Keep silence‚ÄîI who owe thee much indeed? A Prince among the People comes to die, And shall no grateful son of verse take heed? Nay, on thy grave, ere falls the earth, I lay This simple wreath to deck thy honoured clay! ON ROBERT BLAKE. Engraved on the Brass in St. Margaret's, Westminster. Kingdom or Commonwealth were less to thee Than to crown England Queen o'er every sea. Strong sailor, sleeping sound as sleep the just, Rest here! our Abbey keeps no worthier dust! TO LORD TENNYSON: On his Eightieth Birthday, August 6, 1889. Master and seer! too swift on noiseless feet Thy hurrying decades fleet with stealthy pace; Yet not the less thy voice is clear and sweet, And still thy genius mingles strength with grace. On thy broad brow alone and reverend face Thy fourscore winters show, not on thy mind. Stay, Time, a little while thy headlong chase! Or passing, one Immortal leave behind; For we are weak, and changeful as the wind. For him long since the dying swan would sing, The dead soul pine in splendid misery. He winged the legend of the blameless King, And crossed to Lotusland the enchanted sea; Heard the twin voices strive for mastery, Faithful and faithless; and with prescient thought Saw Woman rising in the days to be To heights of knowledge in the past unsought; These his eye marked, and those his wisdom taught. And he it was whose musing ear o'erheard The love-tale sweet in death and madness end; Who sang the deathless dirge, whose every word Fashions a golden statue for his friend. May all good things his waning years attend Who told of Rizpah mourning for her dead! Or in verse sweet as pitying ruth could lend The childish sufferer on her hopeless bed; Thoughts, pure and high, of precious fancy bred. His it is still to scan with patient eye The book of Nature, writ with herb and tree; The buds of March unfold, the lush flowers die, When sighs of Autumn wail o'er land and sea, And those great orbs which wheel from age to age, Cold, unregarding fires that seem to blight All yearning hope and chill and noble rage; And yet were dead, and void, maybe, of light, Till first they swam upon a mortal's sight. Master and friend, stay yet, for there is none Worthy to take thy place to-day, or wear Thy laurel when thy singing-days are done. As yet the halls of song are mute and bare, Nor voice melodious wakes the tuneless air, Save some weak faltering accents faintly heard. Stay with us; 'neath thy spell the world grows fair. Our hearts revive, our inmost souls are stirred, And all our English race awaits thy latest word! TO HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, Revisiting Wales. August 24, 1889. Welcome, dear Lady, welcome once again, To thine own land‚Äînor for the last time come. Small is our Gwalia, but a fair domain, Who comes to her comes home. Come now and often, still our warm hearts burn, Though the swift winters close or dim the eyes That saw thee last; to thee our spirits turn, Still to our lips true words of welcome rise. Dear Lady! welcome, welcome home! Our Cymric eyes grow bright to see our Sovereign come. Once long ago, didst thou, a careless child, With smooth young brow on which the Imperial Crown Weighed not as yet, amidst our hillsides wild Abide, and with thine own Didst spend thy Springtime's joyous hours and bright, Safe-guarded by a mother's tender care. Then all the unfolding world showed clear and fair To thy unwearied mind and eager sight; Ah! it is blest indeed to be In life's young morn with all fair things to see! And then thou camest to thy Wales once more In happy wedlock, by the knightly arm Of thy new Arthur, sheltered safe from harm, By Menai's sounding shore, Strong in Love's strength, as one who seemed to bear A potent talisman to shield from ill. But what defence averts the stroke of care, Or blunts the shafts of Heaven's mysterious will! Grief dwelt with thee long time, but now The crown of Resignation decks thy brow. Dear Lady, we are feeble folk, and weak, But our old tongue and loyal hearts we keep; We cherish still the love we may not speak‚Äî The old affection deep. Still is our Wales ‚Äúa sea of song,‚Äù and still From smiling valley, and from soaring hill, Eryri's snows and fair Clwyd's verdant plain, Or that strange shrine upon the Western Main, There comes a universal voice Of welcome to our Queen, bidding all hearts rejoice. VENITE PROCIDAMUS. Our hopes, our fears, Our love and hate, Our joys and tears, Our throws with fate, What are they all but phantoms fleeting past, Weak creatures of a day, which but a day may last? But the great Scheme Fares on its course Thro' Time's long dream Of changing force. It saw the plesiosaur and mastodon Wax strong, and dwindle down, and still goes silent on. It saw the ape Rule every land, The cave-man shape Flints for his hand. It saw a thousand generations pass Across life's mournful stage, like visions in a glass. It saw the strange Forgotten Kings, Ages of change, Terrible things, It saw the Egyptian and the Assyrian come, The gay Hellenic bloom, the rugged sway of Rome. These too it saw Totter and fall, A purer law O'er-ruling all, And then the arrested march, the long delay, The baffled hope, the Dawn fading to common day. It makes no cry, It lifts no voice, Tho' all things die, Tho' all rejoice, It goes unceasing onward, blind and dumb, Nor halts, nor hastes, nor heeds whatever things may come. Eternal Scheme, Great Lord of all, August, Supreme, Prostrate we fall, We cannot know Thy working, nor its end, Nor by what hidden paths Thy Perfect Will may tend. But if one word Might come, or sign, Our souls were stirred To growths divine, No longer should we walk in fear and doubt, Like children in dark ways, before the stars come out. Ah no! the word The soul can hear Is only heard By the inner ear, No outward light it is which can illume The spiritual eye, and pierce the enshrouding gloom. An inborn light, An inner voice, Which burneth bright, Which doth rejoice, A Faith in things unseen, an inward sight Which thro' a wrecked world sees the victory of Right. With this our guide, Our strength, our stay, No more aside Our footsteps stray. Fulfil Thyself, Great Scheme, Eternal Plan, Work out‚Äîwe ask no word‚Äîthe Destiny of Man. A VISION OF SAINTS. Once, long years since, I dreamt a dream of Greece And fair fantastic tales of Nymph and Faun And thin heroic forms, and ghostly gods Floating in loveliness by grove and hill And lake-side, all the joyous innocent grace Of the old Pagan fancies; mixt with tales Of passion and unhappy deeds of old, Dark, unforgotten. Yesternight I knew Another dream, a vision of old Rome, Sterner and harsher, and the new-born grace Of sacrifice; of life which for the Truth Bore misery to the death, while they, the blithe Faint gods of Fancy, grew to fiends of Ill Athirst for pain and blood, and the old grace To the new suffering, and the careless lives That were content to enjoy, and asked no more Than some brief glimpse of Beauty ere they died, To grave bent brows, and tortured limbs, and all The armoury of pain. And once again, As the great Master passed to Paradise, With a celestial guide, I seemed to tread Where in the infinite Empyrean dwell The blessed company of Saints, and move, Conveyed by soaring wings to highest Heaven, 'Midst those who bare of old the victor's palm And wore the crown‚Äîmartyr and eremite, Lives spent in toil for God, or fired with love, An infinite concourse pure and white as snow; While far away on that unbounded air Scarce reached by sight were saints of hoary eld, Who by old Nile or the Chald√¶an plain, Through grave lives lighted by a certain hope, Foreknew the weighing of the soul for doom, And that unaided, darkling way which threads The Valley of the Shadow, and passed to life Dim centuries, ere yet the Lawgiver Strode from the fiery Hill with face aflame, Down to the listening Tribes. Not of old days Were all the souls I saw, nor yet of Rome, In birth or faith, but down long vistas gray Of centuries we fared, by endless ranks Of sanctity, cloistered or secular, But all of Heaven; and later born in time, Preachers inspired and ministering souls Of women, whom no vow nor cell immured, But a great pity drew and pious care For fallen lives, and those who in the world, Not of it‚Äîpoets, thinkers, lawgivers, Lovers of Country, of the Race, of God, High souls and just who wrought in sight of all, Toilers obscure who worked their work and died‚Äî Bloom, in all time, the innumerable throng That, year by year, the Eternal Seasons raise To make our poor world sweet. All these I saw, A concourse vast of every race and tribe And tongue; till as I gazed, a shining band New risen, and bearing on their front the mark Of our quotidian life and modern speech, Streamed through the boundless vast; and as we passed Those saints long risen, or mortal yesterday, I questioned him who led me of the lives And fate of some, and he, with solemn speech, Made answer as we went. But ere we came To real lives, lived upon earth for Heaven, Two gracious legends, like the vanished tales Of older Greece, twin dreams within my dream, Each with its precious, hidden treasure, took My eyes awhile, twin truths on which are built Our newer, higher hopes, but of old time Unknown or dimly felt‚Äîthe blessed dream Which all have dreamt and shall, of life which ends not With the last breath, but, to some finer air Escaping, doth renew itself and press To what high work we know not, in some sphere Unreached by thought, yet sure; and one the strength Of weakness, when the too strong soul bows low Before God's will, and doth exalt itself Through self-surrender. These, the corner-stones Of all our Faith, my guide, in parables Part true, part feigned, declared to me, and I Listened with eager ears. And first I seemed To greet a joyous, radiant company, Seven comely youths who, fresh from secular sleep, From out a caverned hillside issued blithe To meet the long-lost day. And thus my guide: ‚ÄúWhen Rome was Pagan still, a little band Of ardent, generous youths who called on Christ, Fled their idolatrous city, thinking scorn To kneel to those false gods their souls abhorred‚Äî And loathing that accurs√®d heathen rout Turned to the silence of the lonely hills That brood round Ephesus, and found at length Shelter and peace, within a winding cave High on the rock-faced side of C≈ìlian, And there dwelt safe, lifting their gracious hymns In worship to the Lord. At last there came Some heathen passer-by, who heard the sound, And straight betrayed them. And the tyrant sent His soldiers, and that none came forth again Rolled in the narrow entrance monstrous rocks, Which shut out air and light. Then when they knew No change of night and day, and all their food Had failed, came Heaven-sent sleep to close their eyes. Deep sleep which knew no waking fell on them For the long space of nigh two hundred years. There they slept on, till now the conquering Cross Prevailed, and 'twas a Christian C√¶sar ruled Where raged the Pagan erst. For thirty years The pious Theodosius swayed the might Of Rome, and then the powers of evil bred Dark heresies to rend the seamless robe The Pagan might not. Doubting voices cried, ‚ÄòNo resurrection is there, but the body Lies rotting in the earth, and the freed soul Weltering upon the unbounded seas of space Is lost within the Universe, nor more Takes its old shape. What? did the prophets know, Moses, Esaias, and the rest, this thing? There is no place of souls nor judgment-day Of deeds done in the flesh, nor heaven nor hell, Only upon the earth our kingdom is. Be wise and occupy, for never indeed Comes any resurrection of the dead; The dead are gone, cleave to the living alone; Use all your nature. Lives the flower again, The brute that comes so near us, and is full Of faithful love and reverence for man As man for God? If all these die and pass, Then shall not we? What else than arrogant pride Blinds men to fact, and fools them with a world No eye has seen, which all the seers of old Knew not nor proved? Nay, surely it were well To take our lives in our own hands, and tread Our fearless paths not looking for reward To any dim unreal sphere, but deem Our individual life ends with the grave, As ends the flower in frost; or if there come Something of higher life, yet 'tis the Race Which profits, naught beside. Wherefore in vain Are all your hopes of Heaven, your fears of Hell, Since 'tis not men who live again, but Man.‚Äô Thus having heard, the pious C√¶sar turned, Struck cold with doubt, as one a palsy takes, Making his limbs hang impotent, his will Powerless to live or die. Alone he sate, Hating the voice, hating his doubt, himself Who doubted, and long time from sight of men Withdrew himself and, clad in sackcloth, pined With ashes on his head, yet found not peace For all his penance, but the spectral doubt Weighed on him like a nightmare night and day. Now at the selfsame hour, when C√¶sar strove With his immense despair, a humble hind, Seeking to find a shelter for his flock, Chanced on the secret cave of C≈ìlian, And toiling with his fellows rolled aside The rocks which sealed its mouth, and went his way, Nor entered; but when now, returning dawn Flooded the long-sealed vault with cheerful day, It pierced to where the sleepers lay, and breathed Some stir of coming life, and they once more Drinking the brisk sweet breath of early morn Opened their long-closed eyes, and woke again To the old earth, and kept the far off past Unchanged in memory, and spake with mirth Of their long sleep, and the fair dreams it brought, And said a prayer, and sang a hymn, and then, Urged by the healthy zest of vigorous youth, Sent one among them, Malchus hight, to buy Food for their hunger. Fearfully he stole Down the long steep to where great Ephesus Shining beneath him lay. Scant change was there, Only the stately house of Artemis He found not where it stood. Half dazed he seemed By too long sleep. But when he gained the gate Of the city, on the walls behold the Cross! The witness to the faith by which he lived, The blessed symbol, which to own was death! But still he seemed to dream, and wondering sought Another gate, and there again the Cross! And as he mused what portent 'twas he saw The passers freely named the holy name Which yesternight brought doom. Then with great joy, Yet deep perplexity, he turned to greet Some face he seemed to know, but it was strange, And strange the fashion of the dress, and strange The accent of the tongue, till, half afraid, He sought where bread was bought, and offering gold, The seller looking saw an ancient coin Of Decius, and would ask him whence it came, Deeming he found by some unhallowed spell Forbidden treasure; and the youth's strange garb And speech, and great perplexity, enforced The doubt, so that they bound him fast and haled him Through the long streets, where all in vain he sought One friendly glance, to where upon his throne The Bishop judged; and when the ag√®d man Questioned him of the thing, and what had been, And sware him on the Cross, straightway the youth‚Äî ‚ÄòWe fled the tyrant Decius, who would bid us Serve the false gods, and‚Äîwas it yesternight?‚Äî Rolled ponderous rocks to seal the cave where I And my companions slept; but now, I pray you What is it that has been? Bear you the Cross And fear not? Call men now upon the name Of Christ and dread not all the bitter pains‚Äî The dungeon, and the torture, and the stake, The tyrannies our fathers knew and we? What change is this assails my ears and eyes‚Äî Strange speech, strange vestments, forms and faces strange? Where is the shining house of Artemis? I pray you tell me what it is has been, And whether I be alive or long time dead, Deceived in dreams by long unnoted years.‚Äô Then fell the Bishop, full of pious awe, Prostrate at Malchus' feet‚Äîthe ag√®d man Before the spirit clothed with changeless youth, Since well he knew what thing his eyes had seen‚Äî A miracle of life, raised from the grave, A miracle of Heaven. And all the throng, Bishop and governor, with all the great And noble of the city, white-haired lords, And stately matrons, coming, knelt with him Before the youth, o'er whose unwrinkled brow Two hundred years had passed and left no sign‚Äî Swift-coming age before eternal youth, Brief life before the endless life of death. Then went they forth, that noble throng, and all The city, to where upon the C≈ìlian hill The seven youthful martyrs lay so long. There in the cave, the blessed company Sate cheerful, wondering much to see the throng, With Malchus leading them; and as the array Drew nearer, heard the sound of hymns, and saw The sacred symbol borne on high, and knew All that had been, and that the might of Wrong Was broken, and the world was of the Faith, And the false gods no more; and then they raised Their clear accordant strains in praise to heaven, And from their happy heads crowned round with light, And from their cheeks red with the heavenly rose, And from their lips touched with divinest song, An effluent glory shone, and all who saw Knew that their eyes beheld the bless√®d dead. Last, Theodosius wrestling with his doubt, And almost conquering, sped o'er land and sea To see the portent, and when he was come And stood before the place the Pagan erst Sealed fast with monstrous rocks, on the young lives Fresh vowed to Christ, and left them there to die, He knelt in silence, and the fire of faith Burned high in him, and dried the deeps of doubt. And when he looked on those immortal eyes, And that first bloom of an immortal youth, His faith grew perfect, and he blest the Lord Who sent the sign. Then, with one voice sublime, The seven awakened spirits sang, ‚ÄòBelieve, Believe through us, O C√¶sar! We are dead, And yet we live. Praise Heaven that we have seen The faith triumphant. Ere the last great day The Lord has raised us that men should be strong, And doubt no longer, but believe indeed The life and resurrection of the world.‚Äô And when their voices died away they bowed Their heads upon their breasts, and kneeling, gave Their spirits back to God; and all who saw, And all who heard, C√¶sar, and all the throng, Doubted no more, but rose and did believe.‚Äù Which things, when I had heard, again I seemed To hear my guide, ‚ÄúKnow, thou that hearest me, Through the round world this fair old legend runs Where man is higher than the beasts that die. The Hindu, dreaming on his seething plains, Cherishes it; the fierce false prophet stole The story; and throughout the fabulous East It lives and thrives to-day; the frozen North Holds it for true; o'er all the ancient world Some fair faint blossom of the gracious tale Lingers, and in the modern springs anew In witness to the light-winged hours which snatch The swift unconscious life from youth to age. Too fair, too fleeting, change confusing change‚Äî Change of a day which works the work of years; Unchanging years, which seem but as a day!‚Äù ‚ÄúBut with still clearer voice, and sweeter tongue, Thus speaks the legend: ‚ÄòSleep and Death are one, Not diverse, and to Death's long slumber comes Awakening sure and certain, when the Dawn Of the Last Day shall break, and shall unseal The long-closed eyes, as that strong sun of Spring Illumed the caves of sleep, and stirred the blood Which else had slumbered still.‚Äô Yet since no sign Comes from our sleepers here, the yearning hearts Which mark the struggling breath come short and faint, The tired eyes close, and the calm peace which smooths The weary brow‚Äîand feel 'tis sleep‚Äîno more‚Äî Yet find no proof, cherish the legend fair, Because life longs to be, because to cease Is terrible, because the listening soul Waits for some whisper from beyond the grave, Waits still, as it has waited through all time, Waits undismayed, whate'er its form of creed, Nor fails, though all is silence, to hold fast, Deep in its sacred depths, too deep for thought, The Resurrection and the Life to be.‚Äù Next 'twas a tall and stalwart form I saw, Like Herakles of old, who strode along, Bearing a staff which seemed to bud and bloom Into the martyr's flower. Fainter he showed In outline than the rest, as if I saw A veil√®d life half hid behind a cloud Of legend, or a real life, perchance, Set round with precious gems of allegory And consecration fashioned from the sum Of meaner lives, less sinful, less cast down, And less triumphant. Was it parable, Not fact, that bade him be? Then it was well To feign the tale‚Äîthe wave of death, the power Of evil, the strong man who turned to good, Whose fleshly strength was broken by the weight Of a little child‚Äîand this dim saint, the thrall Of evil once, is precious, as the lives We track from birth to death. Thus then my guide Held converse as we passed. ‚ÄúNo name there is More strange and quaint and sweet than Christopher's, Who bore the Christ. In the far fabulous East He served, a soldier. Nature, which so oft Grudges her gifts, gave this man stalwart limbs And giant strength, joined with the choicer gift Of a keen brain, and daring will, and high Ambition which aspires. Him the blithe voice Of swift adventure called o'er land and sea, The magical music, heard of nobler souls, Which dulls all lower voices. More than Prince This doughty champion showed, a King of men, Who saw Power shining starlike on the hills And set his face to reach it. Luxury Held him nor sensual ease, who was too great For silken fetters; a strong will and arm Bent to a higher end than those, and fired By higher longings. Every soul of man Knows its own weakness, so this strength o'ergrown Only achievement drew. O'er land and sea, From realm to realm, he went, seeking a Lord Still mightier than the last, until at length A slumbering soul, not prizing good or ill, He found a puissant Prince and served content. But 'mid the rugged ways of this sad world, As now he fared unmoved, the frequent sight Of evil; the blind rage which takes and sways The warrior in the fight; the hopeless pain Which unregarded cries to Heaven; the wrong Done on the earth for ever; the great sum And mystery of Evil, worked on him With that strange spell of power which only takes The strong soul captive. Here was strength indeed, Greater than mortal, which had power to bind The mightiest in chains, now forcing them Despite themselves to wrong, now binding them With sensual fetters. Was not this enough To limit Heaven itself? So this rude soul Bowed to it, taking Evil for his god, A voluntary thrall. Yet not to him The smooth foul ways of sense, the paths of wrong, Brought pleasure of themselves; only a beat Of pulsing life, the keenness and the glow Of full impassioned being. So long time He served the Lord of Evil; deeds of wrong And anger knew he, stains of sensual sin; So that, for dread of him, men named his name ‚ÄòThe Unrighteous,‚Äô but he recked not. Power and fame Sufficed him long, and hid from him the fashion Of his own life, and by what perilous ways He went, and black unfathomed gulfs of Ill. Till one day, as he journeyed (so the tale, The allegory of this sinful soul) Through a thick wood, which was the deadly shade Of sense, and of the world, which hid the heavens, Blinding the eye of day; with wondering thought He knew his vanquisher, the Lord of Ill, Cower down as from a blow, hiding his eyes From some white suffering form. And lo! his gaze Met that great symbol of all sacrifice Which men have worshipped since; the soft sad eyes, The painful limbs fixed to the Tree of Death Which is the Tree of Life; and all the past Fell from him, and the mystery of Love And Death and Evil; Might which gives itself To save the Race, and dying, breaks in twain The vanquished strength of Hell; all these transformed His inmost being, and his prisoned soul, Spurning its former chain, stood fair and free, Unfettered, for a while, and then he fell Prone on the earth, the mild and pitying eyes Bent on him still. There he lay motionless A night of precious sorrow, till at last The sun rose on the earth and on his soul, And Dawn, returning, brought the purer Day. But when he rose, the ancient mastery And thirst for power, springing anew in him Once more resistless, over land and sea Drave him to seek this new and mightier Lord Who brake the power of Ill. So far and wide He fared, a passionate Pilgrim, but found not The Lord Divine‚Äîfor Him indeed his eyes Saw not as yet‚Äîfilled with the pride of life, Touched with desire for good, since it was strong, But prizing strength alone. Till as he went His footsteps chanced upon a stony land Where sprang no herb. There, in a lonely cell, Pondered an aged man; no other thing Of life was there, only wan age, which paused Upon the verge of death. His giant strength Was flagging now. Beyond the ghostly hills The sun was sinking, and the gray of night Stole upward. Through the plain beneath the cell A broad black river raged, spanned by no bridge For travellers, but a dark road stole to it O'ergloomed by cypress, and no raft was there Nor ferry. Evermore beyond the shade, Breast-high, the strong stream roared by dark as doom. There on the brink he paused, and saw no soul, Watching the stream of death. Great misery And weakness took him, and he sank, o'erborne, Prone on the strand. Then on the farther shore The sunset, glancing for a moment, fired A thousand palace casements, soaring spires, And airy domes, and straight his glad soul knew That it had seen the city of the King. Then presently he heard a reverend voice From out the gloom. And now the sun had set, And all the hills were hidden. ‚ÄòSon, thou com'st Seeking the Lord of Life. There is no way But through yon cruel river. Thou wert strong: Take rest and thought till strength return to thee. Arise, the Dawn is nigh. Then they twain went, And there that faint soul rested many days. But when the strong man's strength was come again His old guide led him forth to where the road Sank in that dark swift stream. The hills were veiled; There was no city to see, naught but thick cloud, And still that black flood roaring. Then he heard The old voice whisper, ‚ÄòNot of strength alone Come they who find the Master, but cast down And weak and wandering. Yet since strength indeed Well used is precious, therefore shalt thou plunge In yon cold stream. Death shall not come to thee, Nor in those chill dark waters shall thy feet Slip, nor thy life be swallowed. Be it thine To bear in thy strong arms the fainting souls Of pilgrims who pass onward day and night, Seeking the Lord of Light. Thou who long time Didst serve the Lord of Evil now shalt serve A higher; and because great penances Are fitting for great wrong, here shalt thou toil Long years, till haply thou shalt lose the stain Of sense and of the world; then shall thy eyes See that thou wouldst. Go, suffer and be strong.‚Äô Then that rude soul, treading those stony ways, Went down into the waters. Piteous cries Called loud to him for help, poor wayfarers Come to life's goal; wan age and budding youth, And childhood fallen untimely. He stooped down With wonder mixed with pity, solacing Those weakling limbs, and, bearing in his arms The helpless burden, through the chill dark depths Of those black swirling waters, undismayed, Strode onward. Oftentimes the deadly chill Of ice-cold floods too strong for feebler hearts Assailed him, yet his giant stature still Strode upright through the deep to the far shore. And those poor pilgrims with reviving souls Blessed him, and left the waters, and grew white And glorified, and in their eyes he knew A wonder and a rapture as they saw The palace of the King, the domes, the spires, The shining oriels sunlit into gold, The white forms on the verge to welcome them, And the clear heights, and the discovered heaven. But never on his eyes, for all his toil, Broke that clear sun, nor those fair palace roofs, As erst upon his weakness. Day and night He laboured unrewarded, and no gleam Of that eternal glory, which would shine Upon those fainting souls, whom his strong arms Bare upward. Day and night he toiled alone Amid the deeps of death. Oft would he rise At midnight, when the cry of sinking lives Called to him on the brink, and succour them Without a thought of fear. Yea, though the floods Roared horribly, and deep called unto deep, Straight through those hidden depths he strode unmoved A strong, laborious, unrewarded soul. Was it because the blot of former sin Clung to him still uncleansed? I cannot tell; The stain of ill eats deep. But to my thought Not thus the legend runs; rather, I deem He loved in good the strength which erst enthralled His life to ill. Therefore this striving soul Still laboured unfulfilled. Thus the slow years Passed, till the giant strength at times would flag A little, and yet bore on. But one still night, Ere cockcrow, when the world was sunk in sleep, A summons came; and he arising saw, With some strange new compassion, on the brink A childish form. A sweet sad glance divine Shone from the eyes. And as the strong man took The weakling to his heart, through the great power Of Pity with new strength, he braved the deep Careless with that light load. But in mid stream The more than human force, the dauntless spirit Which long time bore unfalt'ring the great load Of mortal ills‚Äîay, though the loud winds beat And the thick night was blind‚Äîthese failed him now, And, as by some o'er whelming weight opprest, His flagging forces tottered; the cold wave Rose high around him; the once haughty head Bowed low, the waters stealing to his lip Engulfed; the burden of the painful world Crushed his weak shoulders; and a bitter cry Burst from him‚Äî‚ÄòHelp! I faint, I sink, I die, I perish; I am spent, and can no more. My strength is naught, the deep floods swallow me. Not of myself I conquered, but of Thee.‚Äô Then suddenly from his spent life he knew The load withdrawn, and through the midnight gloom There burst the glorious vision of his dreams, The palace of the King, the domes, the spires, The shining oriels sunlit into gold, The heaven of heavens discovered, and a voice‚Äî ‚ÄòThou hast sustained the whole world, bearing Me The Lord of Earth and Heaven. Rise; turn awhile To the old shore of Time. I am the King Thou seekest. I have known thy sin, thy pain, Thy tears, thy penitence. If thy soul ask Proof of these things, this sign I give to thee. Set thou thy staff to-night upon the verge Of these dark waters, and with break of dawn Seek it, and thou shalt find it burgeon forth With fair white scented blossoms. This shall be Witness of what has been.‚Äô And he with joy, Vanquished at length, obeyed, and with the dawn Where stood his staff, there sprang the perfumed cup And petals of a lily: so the tale. Nay, but it was the rude strength of his life Which blossomed into purity, and sprang Into a higher self, beneath the gaze Of a little child.‚ÄîNay, but it was the might Of conscious strength, which cast its robes of price Down on the earth; the new self stripped and purged Of ingrained pride, which from the deeps of death Rose painful to the stable earth again, And grew regenerate through humility. So for the remnant of his days he served The Lord of Good, a champion of the Right, Grown meek. At last the Pagan governor Bade him deny the Lord who succoured him; Whom he contemning, gained a martyr's crown Through pain and death, and is Saint Christopher.‚Äù He ended, and I mused in silent thought On this quaint legend, when again my guide‚Äî ‚ÄúEven so they toil as he, the striving souls Who live on earth to-day engrossed with care Willing to better our poor world, which calls Always with piteous suffrages to Heaven‚Äî Strong souls with deep compassion for the race, Seeming possest, yet vainly, since their labour Born of the half unconscious pride of strength Is only part for others, or for God. But when a nobler, self-less passion fills The heart and soul, then only fit reward Is theirs, and from the depths of their dead selves, And from the staff of their discarded strength, And from the unneeded treasures of their past, The yearning to fulfil the Perfect Scheme, The full surrender to the Heavenly Will, Obedience, self-effacement, sacrifice, Life a white perfumed blossom springs to Heaven.‚Äù And as we left the haunted border-land Of fantasy, for lives, which lived and died In the long-vanished centuries, true indeed Though broidered here and there with flowers of gold By pious hands devouter than our own, Yet mainly true; first of the endless line I saw a calm and Princely Presence come, Who, stately as the Imperial Purple, bore His robe, a saint in mien, mild, innocent, Perfect in manhood, with clear eye serene, And lofty port; who from the sages took What lessons earth could give, but trod no less The toilsome path of Duty to the end; And as he passed I knew the Kingly ghost Of Antonine, who knew not Christ indeed Yet not the less was His. I marked the calm And thoughtful face of him who ruled himself, And through himself the world, and 'mid the soil And foulness of unfettered lusts kept pure His virgin soul, and o'er the servile crowd, Trembling, betrayed, beneath the arm√®d heels Of a long line of tyrants trodden in blood, Wielding a blameless sceptre, stayed awhile By a white life, and perfect, lived for Good The hurrying doom and ruin of the world. Whom when we passed, thus spake my heavenly guide: ‚ÄúThere are of Him, who call not on His name, And this is of them, the best flower and fruit Of all the Heathen world, the Sage who ruled The race of men, for whom the fatal gift Of power unfettered worked nor hurt nor harm, But left his soul unchanged: for whom the gross And sensual lusts which wrecked the hapless line Of C√¶sars were as naught, the coward fears Of tyranny unknown, the secret arts Of the informer hateful; since he lived The foremost citizen of Rome‚Äîno more Nor lower, happy, loving wife and child And all his people as a father might The offspring of his love. Then first indeed Crowned, on a throne, Divine Philosophy Swayed all the race of men, like that fair dream Of the Athenian sage, and too great weal Lulled them to sleep, till they forgot to prize Their freedom lost for ever. All his soul Was filled with love of peace, holding it more To save a single citizen than slay A thousand enemies. A thrifty mind Grudging his people's toil, not less he planned Great works and beautiful, which might enrich The City of the world, and, loving peace, Yet not the less the reverence for his name Spread to earth's limits. On the distant bank Of Phasis, to a king whom C√¶sar named, The stubborn tribesmen bowed. The Parthian spared Armenia at his nod. The Scythian hosts On the Cimmerian shore confessed his might, And on the wild Sarmatian plains his word Was law, and many a barbarous chieftain came To kneel his vassal, whom with soothing words He would dismiss, deeming his load of rule Sufficient without more. For that great gift Of Rome to men, just laws and wise, his thought Devised new gains, filled with the purest love Of Heaven-sent equity; and that rare flower Of tolerance which best of all adorns The philosophic brow; which those who call On a Diviner name learn last of all; Which wise Aurelius knew not, nor the books Of all the sages taught; in this pure heart Sprang up self-sown, and bloomed in noble deeds, From sceptic Greek and unbelieving Jew, Shielding the faith of Christ, not carelessly, With that contemptuous charity the fruit Of cold and doubtful minds, but born of trust In the old faith, and therefore generous. Dost wonder that against so white a soul, So pure, so innocent, so rich in love, There burned the causeless enmity that fires The traitor's base ambition? Two there were; But one the Senate doomed, the other fell By his own hand. But when they told the saint, Seeking to unmask some deep conspiracy, He would not. ‚ÄòSure,‚Äô he said, ‚Äò'twere little gain To learn that of the people of my love So many hate me.‚Äô Ah, fair words and high Of one who spotless filled the blood-stained throne Round which for two long centuries had twined Rank growths of vile mistrust and hate and blood! Thus through his long and peaceful years the saint Lived cheerful. All good things were his to hold, And hardly clouded days, because his soul Took willingly his lot. And yet he lost His well-loved sons before their budding age Had come to flower. And yet 'twas his to bear The curse of a vile woman; but his faith, Greater than her offence, forbade him still To hold her false; too pure, too meek a soul To mate with such, or haply half aware And yet forgiving all, like Him who bade The sinner sin no more. Still on his life The Sun of Righteousness shone clear and lit His way with gleams of Heaven, and all his days Were gilded, year by year, until the end, As his who treads the duteous paths of life And is content. Then, when he came to die, Commending, with calm love, his only child And, most of all, the Empire which he loved To him who followed him, the sage his hand Had trained in his own virtues, tranquilly He laid him on his bed; and when the end Drew near, the watchers heard the failing voice Wander in dreams, and whisper of the State And all his hopes for her. And when he woke, Laying all signs of sovereignty aside, He bade them take the golden Victory, The solemn symbol of Imperial power, And bear it to Aurelius. Last, when now Life's tide was ebbing fast, he summoned to him The tribune of the guard, and uttered clear, As should an Emperor who led his hosts To battle with the evil of the world, The password of the day‚Äîone word, no more, Calm and Imperial‚Äî‚Äò√Üquanimitas.‚Äô‚Äù And something in me seemed to rise and break In utterance, and as we passed I cried, ‚ÄúThis man was of Thy name, O Lord, and Thou, Among the ranks of those who lived ere yet Thou camest, or called not on Thee, having come, Didst never leave Thyself, or then or since, Wholly without a witness, but didst set Thy light for all to see, these precious blooms Of purity, these priceless lives unstained And spent for Duty, 'mid the strifes, the lusts Of a polluted world.‚Äù And then I saw Two girlish mothers, bearing each a child Clasped to her breast, one with the conscious pride Of noble birth, and one a lowlier form, Who to the other looked with loving eyes In which the old respect was mingled now With a new sense of equal sisterhood; And both with rapt gaze went, as keeping still Some memory of surprise, since first they rose From earth to heaven; and my guide named their names Discoursing thus: ‚ÄúBy the Tyrrhenian Sea In Africa, when nigh two hundred years Passed since Christ died, there lived a youthful wife, Bearing her first-born infant at her breast, Perpetua, of noble lineage, nursed Safe in the shelter of her happy home From maidenhood to gracious motherhood; Nor broke there on her tranquil hours a sound Of the great suffering of the painful world, But evermore in gracious liturgies Of homely life she spent her careless days, Shielded from every breath of ruder air Which might assault her, fenced about secure By walls of love; sire, mother, brother, spouse, Linking close arms around her, and her birth And name, and rank and wealth, and honour of men Made this rude path of life and rugged steep Show, like the fields of June, a maze of flowers. Now on those calm and slumbering days there burst The New Faith like a flame, and the quick soul Of the young wife was fired, and she became A catechumen and embraced the truth, Scorning the Pagan gods; and her young brother, Like her, believed, and so in piety They lived, till came an overwhelming wave Of bloodshed once again, and they denounced The faithful pair, and first Perpetua. But when this great blow fell on him, her sire, A noble, holding fast the faith of old And loving with a father's love his girl And her young child, ere yet the shadow of doom Fell on them, went to her, and of his love Would seek to bend her, using all the strength Which venerable age and filial awe Might give him; bade her pause awhile and seek Counsel of wiser heads than hers, who knew The riddles of the Faith, and what deep truths, Though hid by myth, maybe, and parable, The Pagan forms concealed. But she, with clear Undoubting faith: ‚ÄòMy father, canst thou change The fashion of a vessel, giving it Another name?‚Äô And he: ‚ÄòNay, 'twere the same Howe'er men called it.‚Äô Then she answered straight, With fearless voice, ‚ÄòNor canst thou change my soul, Which bears the name of Christ.‚Äô Then with deep grief The old man raised his hand as if to strike, But could not, seeing her undaunted soul, And went his way, nor troubled her; and she, In that short time of rest, cleansing her soul With the baptismal waters, rose refreshed, A Christian, strong to suffer and give praise. Then in a few brief days began the tale Of Martyrdom. 'Tis her own voice that speaks The story of her suffering. ‚ÄòIn the gloom Of a dark prison cell, where stifling heat And the rude insults of the brutal guard Tortured each sense, I lay in misery. There my young bondswoman Felicitas, Wanting a month to labour, took with me The sacred lustral waters, and we sate Pining amid the squalor of the jail, Until at last, their hard hearts moved by Heaven, They brought my darling to me, and I gave him Milk from my breast, and thenceforth day and night I lived content, my child within my arms; And those dull prison walls seemed more to me Than my sire's palace, since I held my love And kept my faith unchanged, and grew to be Happier, than ever in that careless life Within my palace home. And then one day My brother, who was partner in my bonds, Seeing my cheerful and undaunted soul, Spake thus to me: ‚ÄúSister, I do perceive Thou art Heaven's favourite; therefore to thy prayer Doubtless the Lord will grant a bless√®d dream, Sent through the watches of the night, if thou Wilt kneel to ask it, and we too shall know Whether the martyr's crown is ours to wear Or shameful freedom.‚Äù Then I prayed, and, lo! In the still watches of the night, a dream Which showed a golden stairway to the skies. Around it swords and hooks and all the array Of martyrdom were ranged, and at its foot A loathly monster, crouching, coil on coil, To take the souls of those who fain would rise. And when, with fear and trembling, I had passed, Naming the sacred Name, to some blest place, A garden, I ascended; there I saw A shepherd with his flock around him ranged By myriads on the grass, who welcomed me And gave me of some mystic food, which I Received with folded hands and took and ate. And all the throng of saints, with one accord, Pealed forth ‚ÄúAmen;‚Äù and sudden I awoke, Hearing their voices, and upon my lips Lingered the sweetness of that heavenly food. And when I told my brother of my dream, We knew our hour was come, our fate assured, And we with nothing more of fear nor hope. Then after many days my father came, Borne down with grief. ‚ÄúDaughter,‚Äù he cried, ‚ÄúI pray thee, Pity these scant gray hairs. If e'er thy sire Loved thee beyond thy brethren, cherished thee Through all thy childhood, watched thee till thou camest To honourable wedlock, now, I pray thee, Have pity on him; make him not the shame Of all mankind. Or if indeed I fail, With all my love, to bend thee, pity her, Thy mother, who has borne thee, and who yearns To clasp her child again. If none of these Move thee, have pity on thy child, who pines Without thee, nor can live without thy breast. Nay, daughter, have compassion! See, thy father Kneels to thee, lady, and in tears, and is Thy suppliant for thyself!‚Äù But I, who knew How wise he was and tender, felt my soul Pierced through with sorrow. Yet the Faith! the Faith! Should I betray it? ‚ÄúNay,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúmy father; We all are in God's hand, who rules all things Even as He will.‚Äù Then sorrowful he went. Now, when the day was come when we should stand For trial of the Judge Hilarion, Even as we stood before him, set on high For all to see, when my turn came to plead, Confessing Christ, I heard a cry, and lo! My father with my infant in his arms, Conjuring me with tender words of love To spare him and my child, whom I had given Life, and now doomed to death, recounting all The misery I should bring. And my sweet turned His darling eyes on me, and smiled and stretched His little hands to me, and seemed to seek His mother's breast. And the stern judge himself Besought me to have mercy and to spare My father and my child, and bade me burn A little incense to the gods. But I, Some new strength firing me, which swept away The love of sire or child, made answer straight, ‚ÄúI will not,‚Äù and confessed I was of Christ. And when my father strove to force me down And hush my voice, the stern Hilarion Gave word that they should scourge him; and I heard The sound of blows, and felt my father's pain Quiver through every nerve, and grew so faint That he should suffer thus, and all for me, Amid his honoured age, that scarce I marked That cold voice dealing doom, the dreadful death Of those the fierce brutes' tooth or claw or horn Rends limb from limb. And then they scourged with thongs Our brother martyrs, while ourselves indeed, Me and my bondswoman Felicitas They buffeted with blows upon the face. But many visions, through the grace of Heaven, Came to me ere the end, and on the eve Of the great shows, when all day long my limbs, Racked in the cruel stocks, scarce ceased to pain, Amid the troubled thoughts of coming doom, The hushed arena framed with cruel faces Ready to gloat on death, the sudden roar As from the darkling dens the famished beast Leapt forth in fury, and the echoing cries From the base coward throng reclining safe To see their fellows bleed, there came a dream Heaven-sent. For, lo! without the dungeon door One seemed to knock; and when I opened to him, The martyred saint, Pomponius, stood without, Clad in white shining garments, all besprent With pomegranates of gold. These words he spake: ‚ÄúPerpetua, we await thee.‚Äù And I followed, And through dark ways he led me, till we came Forth 'mid the still arena's sudden blaze. And then he left me, and they bade me fight No tiger, but some loathly shape of man, Who held a bough laden with golden fruit For prize of victory. Then we strove long Together; but I conquered, and I gained The precious fruit, and suddenly I knew That not with ravening tooth or rending claw Alone 'twas mine to fight, but with the force Of Evil, human-shaped, Evil without, Evil within, if one would keep the Faith.‚Äô Dear soul, so far she speaks, the rest for her Is silence, but a witness speaks who saw What things were done. When their last day was come, On that accurs√®d Pagan holiday, The people heard, thrilled with a shameful joy, The roarings of the famished brutes beneath. And they, too, heard it, and the gathering roar Of the more brutal crowd; sitting alone In silence and in darkness, till the hour When they, weak nursing mothers, faithful youths, Noble and slave, alike went forth to face The oft imagined dread, the tooth, the claw, The piercing horn, the spring, the devilish strength, The same Hand fashioned which could frame the lamb. Sure, 'twere no wonder if those delicate lives, Forlorn of help, scorned, tortured, of their God Forsaken, as their Master, had shrunk back From that intolerable fear; but they Shrank not at all, strong souls, but dauntless went, Leaving their new-born joys, and the young lips Of children at the breast, home, love, young life, And all for Christ, fronting the horrible dread Unmoved, unfearing‚Äîwent without a word Through hollow stifling dungeons, lost in gloom, To where, on a sudden, blazed the noonday glare Above the arena, and the solitude Horrid with pitiless eyes, and the loud roar Of the imprisoned beasts behind the bars, That presently the cruel spite of men Should loose on them. And there they stood and sang A hymn 'midst jeering thousands. On the youth Who suffered first, a leopard, springing, bathed His poor frame in a baptism of blood; And when, oh, shame! they stripped those wifely limbs Before the ribald gaze of countless eyes‚Äî They had not looked for that‚Äîa deadly chill Took them, and what the terror of the beasts, The lions' dreadful roaring, the fierce growl Of the impatient tigers, the red jaws Of the tall bears who shook their bars, the low Fierce muttering of the bulls, whose lurid eyes Glared on them, could not, wifely modesty Had well-nigh done, when some new Heaven-sent shame Touched the vile throng, who bade the jailers hide Their nakedness; and there, in robes of white, Naming the holy Name, they stood and took The mad brutes' horrible rage, and, pierced and tost By the sharp horn, and hurled in air, and trod By the fierce rushing feet, they lay alone, Bleeding upon the sand, swooning away, Or by some heavenly ecstasy possessed Which dulled their pain. But when Perpetua Knew life return, she her dishevelled hair Tied in a knot, and round her wounded limbs Gathered her robe, and seeing on the ground The young Felicitas, assuaged her pain And lifted her, waiting again the rush Of the fierce beast; but when he came no more, The sordid crowd, still hungering for blood, Demanded they should die before their eyes. Then, in their midst, the dauntless martyr band Stepped forth and gave the sacred kiss of peace, And met swift death; but she, Perpetua, From some unskilful hand or timorous, took Repeated blows, and languished long, and bore Wound upon cruel wound ere her pure spirit Was freed and rose, and rested with the blest.‚Äù And straight my heart, hearing this piteous tale, Was melted in me, and I seemed to cry, ‚ÄòThese are Thy saints, O Lord, like those whose bones Lie scattered in Thy Alpine valleys cold, Or who to-day by Thy idolatrous East, Or Thy old Nile, or on the desert sands, Or gemlike islets of the tropic sea, Have died without a murmur for Thy sake. Thou askest of Thy creatures sacrifice, And it is given, nor yet with readier soul In the first ages of the Faith than now. Haply with blinder courage 'twas they went, These protomartyrs, to their doom, than those Who die to-day. With what high flame of faith These souls were set on fire, who met unmoved‚Äî Delicate lives lapt round with luxury‚Äî The scorn of men, the jeering careless crowd, The tortures of the fiends, rather than pay False homage to false gods! And yet, indeed, I know not if there be not sacrifice As willing now; the Indian well to-day Is choked with women's corpses, who had bought Ease, wealth, and life, nay, more‚Äîthe dearer lives Of children‚Äîhad they borne to bend the knee To the false Prophet. Nay, Thy hand, O Lord, Is strong as it was then, Thy seeming face Averted as 'twas then, till the last breath Sobs from the painful lips, and Thou dost bid them Enter into Thy joy. Thou seest all And speakest not, but these Thy servants hear Some still small whisper which the duller sense Of the world may not take. But whoso hears Thy voice, for him the aspect of things seen And felt‚Äîthe world without, the world within‚Äî The old familiar landmarks of his life, The heavens, the earth, the sea, no longer show As undetermined fantasies; but all The smiling summer plains, the stormwrapt hills, The clear cold dawn, the angry furious night, Lives bright as Heaven, lives dark as nether Hell, Joy, grief, pain, pleasure, mingle and are part Of the unfolding mystery of Faith!‚Äù Then, as we passed, we came on one whose face The whole world knows‚Äîso fine a soul and hand Saw her long since, and fixed her for our eyes‚Äî A maiden with rapt gaze, and at her side An idle music; listening half entranced To some celestial harmonies unheard Save by pure souls like hers. There was no need To name her name, when thus the tale began: ‚ÄúOnce in old Rome, long centuries ago, There lived a pair, noble in rank and soul, Who, though the Pagan idols still bare sway, Knelt not to them, holding the faith of Christ. And one fair girl was theirs, Cecilia, Nourished on thoughts of virgin purity Which filled her cloistered gaze. No earthly love Might touch her pure pale soul, which always viewed, Lit only by the frosty moon of faith, The cold clear peaks of soaring duty pierce The still blue vault of heaven, as soar the snows Of lifeless Alp on Alp, where comes no herb Nor blade of green, but all the icy world Dreams wrapt in robes of sterile purity. For evermore to her rapt eyes the skies Stood open, evermore to her rapt ear Celestial music came, and strains unheard By mortal ear amid the throng of life Hushed all the lower tones and noise of earth With heavenly harmonies; and the high notes Of the invisible chanting seraphim Would occupy her life, until her soul, Rapt by the ravishing sound, would seem to 'scape From her raised eyes, and float, and speed itself Between the rhythmic wings of harmony, Even to Heaven's gate, and was transformed and lost Its earthly taint; and sometimes on her lips Thin traces of the heavenly music dwelt, Which bound the listener fast, and of her skill Some half-remembered echoes, faint yet sweet, Were born again on lute or pipe, and linked The world with Heaven; the immortal chanting quires With earth's poor song; the anthems of the blest With our weak halting voices, till the being Of that fair virginal interpreter, Pierced with keen melodies, and folded round With golden links of gracious harmonies, Was all possest of Heaven, and to her thought It seemed a guardian angel stood by her In sleep or waking hours, so that no care For earth or earthly love might press on her. Such sweetness touched her voice; the starry quires Would hearken pleased, and voices not of earth Mingled with hers harmonious, and she drew From voice and hand such descants as the skies Themselves had envied, as with pipe on pipe Conjoined with wedded notes and varying tones She made high music to our Lord in heaven. Now, when this maiden lost in dreaming thought Was of full age, her father bade her wed A noble Roman youth, Valerian, A Pagan yet; but she, whose filial love Constrained her to obey, beneath her robes Of marriage hid a robe of penance still, And to her husband, whom indeed she loved With wifely love, confessed her mystic tale‚Äî How night and day, whether she slept or woke, A ghostly presence, standing at her side, Kept watch and ward, nor left her. And when he Asked sight of him, and proof, she bade him seek The saintly Urban in the Catacombs, Where he lay hid, and he consenting went, And rose converted from his old unfaith And was baptized; and when, a Christian now, He sought his home again, he heard within Enchanting music strange, and strains divine; And long time listening rapt, at last he came To his wife's chamber, and beheld, indeed, His eyes being opened by his faith, a form Celestial standing by her, with a crown Of roses in each hand, in scent and hue Immortal, and the Angel as they knelt Crowned each with them‚Äîthe crown of martyrdom. And then, because the Lord Valerian Obeyed so well, the Angel bade him ask What boon he would. And he: ‚ÄòMy lord, I have A brother of my love, Tiburtius; Let him believe.‚Äô And he made answer to him, ‚ÄòSo shall it be, and ye shall both attain The martyr's crown.‚Äô And then he passed away. And presently Tiburtius, entering, Though yet he might not see the roses, knew Their fresh immortal sweetness flood the air With fragrance, and he heard the gracious words Cecilia spake, and all her proofs inspired Of Heaven and of the truth, and so his heart Was touched and he baptized and held the Faith. But when the Pagan Lord, Almachius, Who governed, heard these things, he bade them cease To call on Christ, and when they would not, sent them To prison dungeons foul, and thence to death. Last, when the brothers died, his pitiless rage Summoned Cecilia. Her, with threats of pain And horrible death, he bade do sacrifice To the false gods. She, with a smile of scorn, Denied him; and the people round who heard Her constancy, wept for the fate they knew Waited the fair girl-wife, and, bathed in tears, Confessed themselves to be like her, of Christ, Till the fierce prefect, mingling rage with fear, Spake thus: ‚ÄòWhat art thou, woman, who dost dare Defy the gods?‚Äô And she, with lofty scorn: ‚ÄòI am a Roman noble.‚Äô Then said he, ‚ÄòI ask thee of thy faith?‚Äô And she: ‚ÄòOh, blind! See these whom my example drew to Christ, Take them for answer.‚Äô Then with panic haste He sent a headsman whose keen axe should end That high undaunted courage. He, with fear And trembling hand, upon her slender throat And virgin breast planting three cruel strokes, Fled, leaving her for dead. But three days yet, Three precious days, she lingered, strengthening all Her converts in the Faith, and to the poor Vowing her wealth; and last of all she sent For Urban, and besought him of his grace That of her palace they should make a church For Christian worship. Then she raised her voice In soaring hymns of praise, and with her sang The quire of Angels, chanting row on row Celestial strains, and the rapt hearers knew The sound of heavenly music and the lyres Of the angelic company; and yet, When her voice soared no longer, but was still, Fair dying echoes, fainter and more faint, Stole downward from the skies, and then were lost Within the heavens‚Äîthe music of a soul Which joins the eternal concert and is blest. And still where once she sang, the unfailing spell Of music rises heavenward, day by day; For, as she would, they built a stately church Above her. There, when centuries were past, The Pontiff Paschal found her body lie, Wrapt in a tissue of gold, and by her side Her husband and his brother. And, again, After long centuries they built a shrine, And set in it a statue of the saint In Parian marble. On her side she rests As one asleep; the delicate hands are crossed, Wrist upon wrist; a clinging vestment drapes The virgin limbs, and round her slender throat A golden circlet masks her cruel wound. And there she lies for all to see; but still Her voice is sounding in the Eternal Psalm Which the Church singeth ever, evermore, The Church on earth, the Church of Saints in Heaven.‚Äù And then it was a youthful pair who came, And noble both, who to each other clung In tender love: he a young soldier tall, With the proud mien and port of one who strode From the far North to the extremest South Before Rome's conquering legions, o'er the world, Bearing the eagles forth; she a fond wife, Who clasped and kissed his hand, and gazed on him With youthful eyes, while with the unbraided gold Of her fair hair, bright as the crowns they wore, He with pure yearning played. I knew them not, Nor doth the world as yet, when thus my guide: ‚ÄúAdrian, Tribune of the Imperial Guard, When the tenth wave of blood assailed the Faith Served in Bithynia. There, a youth in years, He lived in wedlock with his youthful love, Natalia, fair, and virtuous as fair, And secretly of Christ. When came command That all should kneel before the heathen gods, The brave S. George tore from the city walls The shameful edict. Then, with coward rage, The Pagan C√¶sars in one day haled forth Two score to death with torture. In the hall Of judgment Adrian, as beseemed his rank, Stood with his soldiers. Fierce and fiercer still The torturers plied their hellish arts; and he, Seeing how firm the martyrs stood and bore Fell malice and the black despite of men, Wondered to see their pious constancy. Last, his great heart grew sickened at the wrong, And then the strong resistless tide of Faith Took him, and he believed, because he knew, That this thing was of God; and his brave soul, Which scorned concealment and the hypocrite's wiles, Burst into word and act, and from his breast He tore the glittering emblems of his rank, And, flinging from him the dishonoured sword Which served the Pagan, being now of Christ, While all his soldiers wondered, knowing not What thing he would, amid the painful throng Of prisoners standing, cried aloud and said, ‚ÄòI too am with them, for I am of Christ; Torture me, slay me, too.‚Äô Then, with amaze, The guards advancing haled him with the rest To prison and to death. But he gave thanks For what had been, and, glorying in his faith, Went with his suffering brethren to his doom. Now, when these things were done, there fell deep awe And pity on all who heard, and to the house Of Adrian hastened breathless messengers To tell of what had been, and how its lord, Spurning the Pagan gods, had braved his doom. ‚ÄòAdrian is Christian and holds fast the Faith, And goes to torture for his Master's name.‚Äô Thus said they; and his wife, who heard the tale, Felt her young heart beat slow, then cease with pain, And swooned; but when her life returned to her, Gave thanks and wept for joy that he, her love, Was worthy to bear witness to the Faith And know a bless√®d death. Quickly she rose And hastened to the prison cell, and there Fell prone on his belov√®d neck, and kissed His heavy chains, giving God praise that he, Like her, was of the Faith, and bade him keep The Truth through death and torment to the end, And comforted her love, and clasped him round, And, on his dear lips showering kisses, went Back to their lonely palace. Three long days She spent in prayer for him, on whom the fell Forces of evil worked their will, and doomed His life to cruel death; but never again, Loving with all her tender heart, would dare To seek his prison cell, lest haply Love Should conquer Duty; but her faithful prayer Rose for him day and night, that he might live Or die, if such God's will, true to the Faith. But on the prisoner Adrian, longing came, When now he was condemned and the new day Should bring him death with pain, if only he Might see his love once more, and when 'twas night, Though firm and constant in the Faith and strong To die for it, an innocent desire To look once more in those belov√®d eyes, And press once more those stainless lips, and hear Once more that tender voice, and seem again A lover as of yore; and, offering gold And giving surety for his safe return Ere the dawn brought the day when he should die, The prison doors flew open, and he stole‚Äî Free once again, as if the fateful Past Were but a dreadful nightmare of his sleep‚Äî Forth from the dungeon's close and filthy air, Through the cool night, by the familiar ways, None in the darkness marking him, to where, Within his palace halls, Natalia mused, Sad, silent, lonely, half distraught in mind‚Äî Sad she should see no more the well-loved face, Glad that her love bare witness to the Faith‚Äî Seeking to exorcise her painful thought With spinning. Then one hastened in and cried, ‚ÄòBe of good heart, dear mistress, for my lord, 'Scaping the dungeon, comes and will be here. Prepare for flight; you shall live happy yet. Have all things ready. Lo! the night is dark; Take horse and flee.‚Äô Then through that faithful heart A thousand warring tides of passion surged‚Äî Hope, fear, love, duty, natural joy and pride Because she was a wife and rapt in love; But at the last, the passion of the Faith Prevailing, prone to earth she fell, and cried, ‚ÄòAh, miserable me, who am too vile To wed with one who wears the martyr's crown! Shall not all men cry shame on me, whose love Led Adrian astray, who else had dared The fiercest torments which the devilish spite Of Hell devised for him! Oh, my lost love, 'Twere better I should love thee thus, and bear Part in thy glory, though it came with death, Than live with thee dishonoured and, through me, Sinking in coward fear the love of God. Nay, my loved Adrian, not for me indeed Shalt thou deny the Faith.‚Äô Now Adrian heard, Standing without, his wife's belov√®d voice, And caught her words, and could not brook delay An instant, but burst swiftly in and clasped her Close to his heart, and lifting up his voice‚Äî ‚ÄòNoblest and best of women, I give praise To God that thou art strong, and that thy soul Is steadfast as my own. I do but come To say to thee ‚ÄúFarewell,‚Äù for with the day I am condemned to die. Full well I knew Thy love would never tempt me to be false; For only utter faithfulness is love But now thy loyal soul has smoothed my path And left my duty easier, and I go Back to my dungeon with a cheerful heart That I have seen thy face.‚Äô Then she arose And kissed him, and upon his breast she laid Her wifely head; and straight, without a word, They twain went unattended through the night, Who might have fled, and by the well-known streets, Hushed now and slumbering; guarded by no guard Save their own honour, sought the prison gate. And, much amazed, the warder marked them come, Hand clasped in hand, and swung the sounding door; And in his prison cell till dawn of day They sate together, waiting for the end. And Adrian, when the day was come, went forth To judgment, and they scourged him sore and racked His limbs with cruel tortures. But his wife They drave forth from him, and he lay alone On the cold ground, with none to comfort him, Since well they knew what charity inspired The womanly soft hearts which called on Christ; And she, lamenting sore and half distraught Because he suffered with no hand to soothe His painful limbs, rose suddenly and took A daring purpose. From her comely head She sheared the golden treasure of her hair, Donning man's garb, and gained the prison gate, Disguised, nor known to any as she went, A man with all a woman's pitying heart, A woman with the courage of a man; And, gaining entrance, sought her love, and bound His piteous wounds, soothed him with loving words. ‚ÄòLight of mine eyes, how blest art thou,‚Äô she cried, ‚ÄòTo suffer for the Faith!‚Äô and strengthened him, And lulled his pain to sleep, and with him sate, Sleepless herself, his head upon her breast, Filled with deep grief and saintly ecstasy, Until the slow dawn, glimmering, brought the day. Then, when the sun had risen, there came command That he should die; but first, with hateful art, His good right hand they severed while he lived. And she saw all, and watched without a word, And all her tender woman's heart stood still To see his pain, and fain had borne it all‚Äî Filled with high pride, yet tortured with regret That she had wrought this thing; and round him cast Her wifely arms, prayed with him, and sustained His ebbing life, till, ere the headsman came To sever from the trunk the well-loved head, With one deep sigh, he breathed his last and gave His soul to God. But she, when all was done, Kissed him upon the painless brow, and stooped And took his severed hand, the dear dead hand Which oft had smoothed her hair; and in her bosom, Upon her wifely breast, she hid it close, The dear dead hand! and, hurrying to her home, Safe in her palace chamber folded it With linen kerchiefs fine, and wrapt it round With precious spices sweet and perfumed oils, And by her lonely bedside kept it long, And often, ere the grey dawn broke, would rise And kiss and clasp it, giving thanks to God That her love kept the Faith. But the saint's body Some faithful Christians stealing from the jail Bore to Byzantium; there with pious care They buried it, and costly obsequies. But she, the sainted woman, dwelt alone Long time within her palace, cherishing The memory of her love. C√¶sar at last, Hating her constant soul, bade her prepare For wedlock with some favourite of the Court, A Tribune of the Guard. No word she breathed Of disobedience, but one night she fled Her widowed home, and, taking ship, sailed forth To Argyropolis, across the sea; And when they told her how her love was laid Hard by, within a costly sepulchre, Dwelt there long time, grown happier that she held Her love's belov√®d dust. Oft in the night She rose and took her to the tomb, and there Knelt, and full often in her weary sleep, Heavy with tears, the blessed Adrian Visited her in dreams, and shone on her Bright with the glory of beatitude, Beckoning that she should follow, till her soul, Straining its earthly fetters, longed to rise And join her love in bliss. And so at length Her fervent prayer was granted. Death set free That faithful heart; and when at last, it loosed Her prisoned spirit, lo! a glorious quire Of Angels, and amid them Adrian, To meet her as she rose; and sphere on sphere They soared together heavenward into joy, Where are the just of old, the seers, the saints And witnesses, and there, no more to part, Bathed in the full light of the Heavenly Sun, They dwell together for ever and are blest.‚Äù And as I listened, rapt in tearful thought, And musing on the mystery of Pain That wings the saintly soul, I heard again: ‚ÄúNot only through the dungeon or the rack Is won the Martyr's crown. Blest souls indeed Are those which suffer openly, and reap Through bodily pain the rich reward of Love‚Äî Dear souls and strong; but those who only bear The suffering of the soul, when the racked spirit Gives love for faith, and dooms a life to die, Dearer than life, for duty, and lives on And bears and does not die, but wears its load For weary years, and hears no loud acclaim Of heavenly quires, and bears no victor's palm, But lives self-doomed to solitude and doubt, And finds the closed heavens deaf, the past a dream, And all the future dumb‚Äîfor these, too, Heaven Keeps its own crown, as precious as the pearl Of sacrifice which shining lights the brow Of agony,‚Äîits own triumphant crown. For what is martyrdom but witness borne To God and Truth, in body as in soul, Through life and death, through sudden stress of pain Or life-long suffering witness to the Right?‚Äù 'Twas an old man came next, who bore the palm, Mild and of venerable mien, with hair And beard of silver, yet his sunburnt cheek Showed ruddy with the hue of health which still Smiles like an Indian summer on the lives Of those who, far from dust and toil of men, Like the first Husbandman, breathe purer air, And watch the opening flowers, the ripening fruits; Changing their healthy toil for tranquil sleep, And mingling works of mercy with pure thoughts And meditations. Him indeed I knew not, And yet half guessed his tale. And this it was: ‚ÄúIn Pontus, by Sinope, dwelt of old, Three centuries after Christ, an ag√®d man, Phocas by name. He to his lowly home Retiring from the busy city, spent His life in meditation on the Faith Sweetening his honest toil. Day after day Within his narrow garden-ground he found Fit labour for his hands; eve after eve, When the sweet toilsome day at last was done, He strayed among the flowers and fruits his skill Had reared‚Äîthe roses red and white which filled The air with perfume, like the fragrant flower Of sanctitude; white cups adust with gold Of lilies, pure as blameless lives, which breathe Their sweetness to the heavens; the flower which bears The symbols of the Passion; the mild roots And milky herbs which nourish those white lives That scorn to batten on the blood and pain Of innocent dumb brutes; such honeyed fruits As our first parents ate in Paradise‚Äî Bright apples, golden pears, pink pomegranates, The pendent purple of the trellised grape, And blushing peaches, and the perfumed globes Of melons; all the flowers and fruits the isles Of the enchanted dim Hesperides Bore in the fabled eld. Of these he took Sufficient for his hunger, praising God, And of the rest he gave of charity To all the poor and weak, free without price, Following his Master's word. And all the poor And needy blessed him and revered the skill Which reared them, and the venerable years Of that good gardener. None who came to him His generous hand denied, but he would give them Shelter and food, and, when the day was done, Converse on things Divine, and many a word Of Truth which swayed the listener, if he were A Pagan still, or heartened him indeed If he already held and loved the Faith. For while to some pure souls the thought, the dream, The bless√®d vision are enough, the sounds Heard by rapt ears, the opened heavens, the joy Of contemplation only, when the sands Of the desert or the cloistered vistas dim Show ghostly 'neath the midnight stars; for some Labour is best‚Äînot sordid labour vile And turned to earth, but that which working still For Heaven doth therefore gain a purer height Than any; and for him the varied page Of Nature painted by a hand divine Brought meditation, and he found a voice In every bursting flower and mellowing fruit; In every life which, governing its way By heavenly rule, lived on without offence And did fulfil its part; in every weed Which cumbered earth, yet doubtless were of aid If we might read its secret; every growth Of poison, which from the same elements, The bounteous earth, the wooing of the sun, The same fair fanning breezes, as the grain On which our lives are nourished, waxed and grew To deal out death and torment. Long he mused On all these things‚Äîhow one great Husbandman Planted them all, and framed them as He framed The tiger and the lamb; and so he gained Mild wisdom from his daily task, and awe, And wonder, which is kin to faith, and thence True faith in God and man, and was content To sow the seed of good within his soul, As in the earth, and root the evil out, And living only for the Faith, to work And be at peace, leaving the rest to Him Who sends in season, sun and rain and cloud And frost, and in whose hand are flower and fruit To give or to withhold, in earth and heaven. Now, one fair summer eve, as Phocas sate At supper, came a knock, and he in haste Opening, three strangers waited at the door, Whom he bade enter and take food and rest; And when they were refreshed, he questioned them What errand brought them. And they said in turn, ‚ÄòWe seek a certain Phocas‚Äîknow'st thou him?‚Äî Who dares to call on Christ, and have command To slay him found.‚Äô Then tranquilly the saint‚Äî ‚ÄòSleep now and rest. I know him. With the dawn I will conduct you to him.‚Äô And they slept, Not dreaming whom they saw, and were content. But he, when all the house was dark and still, Stole out into his garden. The faint stars, Pale in the radiance of the summer night, Trembled above him; at his feet the flowers He loved so well declined their heavy heads And slumbering petals. One loud nightingale, Thrilling the tender passionate note of old, Throbbed from a flower-cupped tree, and round him all The thousand perfumes of the summer night Steeped his pleased sense in fragrance sweeter far Than frankincense the skill of men compounds In Araby the Blest. Then on the grass He sate him down, rapt deep in musing thought; And o'er him, ghostly white or gleaming red, The roses glimmered, and the lilies closed Their pure white cups, and bowed their heads, and seemed To overhear his thought. ‚ÄòShould he then fly, To live a little while, leaving his home And all that made it dear, the flowers, the fruits He loved, and preach the Faith a little yet Before Fate called him? Surely life is sweet To tranquil souls, which scorn delights and take Something of Heaven on earth; ay, sweeter far Than the old haste of flushed and breathless chase, Strong pulses, vaulting projects, hot designs To capture worthless ends. Haply 'twere well For this, to leave the solitude he loved As others wife or child.‚Äô But as he mused, The thought of full obedience filled his soul; Submissive to the Heavenly Will which sent Those fatal messengers, and destined for him The martyr's crown, and swayed and took so fast His doubtful mind, that presently he rose, As one whose purpose halts not‚Äîrose and went As in a dream, and coming brought a spade And softly, half in dreams, began to delve The flower-lit turf, within a sheltered nook O'ergrown with roses and the perfumed gloom Of blossomed trees. And as he wrought, he laid Turf upon turf, and hollowed out a space In the fresh virgin mould which lay beneath, Shaped deftly in the semblance of a cross, Large as might take the stature of a man. And still half dreaming, nor confessing yet What thing he did, deeper and yet more deep He dug and laboured, till with earliest dawn, Just as the waking birds began their song, He flung the last mould upwards, smoothing fair The edges of the trench, and knew at length That all night long he laboured at his grave. And at its foot were lilies white and gold, And at its head were roses white and red, And all around a pitying quire of flowers Bent down regarding it; and when he saw, Still half as in a dream, he whispered, ‚ÄòLo! The narrow bed is ready; ere 'tis day The sleeper shall be laid in it, and prove Unbroken slumbers blest, until the peal Of the loud Angel wakes him from the skies.‚Äô Then to his home returning grave and slow, He sought his guests, on whom the new-born day Was rising. They with half-awakened eyes Greeted their coming host, and, bidding him Good morrow, rose and took the frugal meal His care provided. Then the question came, ‚ÄòHast brought him whom we seek?‚Äô And he: ‚ÄòI have.‚Äô And they: ‚ÄòWhere find we him?‚Äô And he: ‚ÄòBehold, I am the man‚Äînone else.‚Äô Then deep distress Took them, and great perplexity, who knew The man whose life they sought the same who gave Shelter and food. But he, revolving all, The martyr's palm and that unchanged resolve Of the still night, bade them take heart for all Their duty bade them. And he led them forth, Through maiden flowers fresh opened to the day, Brushing the dewdrops from them as they went To where, set round with blooms, they found his grave Fresh delved in daisied turf, and there they bound Their willing prisoner, and the headsman's axe, Even as he knelt, a smile upon his lips, By one swift, skilful blow and merciful, Upon the grassy margin, painlessly Severed his life. And there they laid him down, Amid the joyous matins of the birds, In the cool earth; and by his head there spiang Sweet roses red and white, and by his feet Deep-chaliced lilies mingled white with gold; And there he waits the day the just shall rise And bloom, as these on earth, beyond the skies.‚Äù But when I heard the gracious tale, which showed Like some fair blossom with a fragrant heart, Thus would I answer: ‚ÄúBlameless anchorite, Meek martyr, self-betrayed, some saints there be Whose youthful suffering draws a readier tear Than thine; and yet, for me, that duteous life Of honest toil for others, that great faith Thou show'dst, that simple eagerness to bear The martyr's palm, that night beneath the stars Of summer, fashioning thy flower-decked grave, That lonely suffering, mark thy life and death With a more calm and gracious note than theirs Who, 'mid the applauding saints around, the throng Of heavenly faces stooping from the skies, In the arena dauntless met their end; A simpler nor less touching piety Than theirs who, 'mid the dust of mortal strife, Shed their pure lives upon the sullen sand.‚Äù And then there passed a beautiful fair maid, A virgin martyr, from whose comely head Shone brighter than her crown, a ray serene Of stainless purity. Her spotless robe Gleamed with strange light, and at her breast she bore Celestial lilies and a fragrant spoil Of roses red and white, red as the blood Of Martyrdom, white as the innocent life Of maidenhood; and straight I knew the name Of Dorothea, whose fair story fires Poet and painter still; and as I gazed I heard, with eager ears, my guide recount The half-remembered tale, and thus he spake: ‚ÄúIn C√¶sarea dwelt a noble maid, A Christian, serving God with prayer and alms And fasting. None more beautiful or pure In all the city, and her fitting name Was Dorothea. And the fame of her, Her beauty, and her saintly life went forth Through all the country. When the governor, Who hated Christ, holding the older creed, Heard of her name and deeds, he gave command That they should bring her to him. On a day He sate on high in judgment, when they brought The maid; and she, with mantle folded close Around her, and chaste downcast eyes, drew near, When he with threatening voice would ask of her, ‚ÄòWho art thou?‚Äô And the maiden: ‚ÄòSir, my name Is Dorothea, and I serve the Lord. Then he, with fury: ‚ÄòThou shalt serve our gods Or die the death.‚Äô But she, with accents mild: ‚ÄòIf I shall die, the sooner shall my eyes Behold His Presence whom they long to see.‚Äô And he: ‚ÄòWhom namest thou?‚Äô Then she: ‚ÄòThe Lord, In whom I live, who is my Heavenly Spouse, Who dwells in Paradise, with whom I long To be, leaving this dead poor earth, and know The fruits that mellow in His garden-ground, The roses that shall never fade, but bear Such amaranthine blooms as heat nor cold Withers, nor time, but blush for ever sweet. Work thou thy will. For me to die is gain, And to live, loss; but for thy Pagan gods, I will have none of them, nor sacrifice To wood or stone, the figments of men's hands.‚Äô Then he, who could not bend that steadfast soul, Commanded they should take her to her cell. Thither he summoned an apostate pair, Christita and Calista, once of Christ, On whom the fear of swift and painful death, The terror of the torments which the spite Of men prepared for them, worked in such sort That they renounced the Faith and knelt again Before the old false gods. To these he gave Great promise of reward if they should make This noble virgin partner in their sin, And to her prison cell, day after day, Despatched them, and they strove to do his will, Using the coward's weapons,‚Äîfear of death, Hope of some baser happiness, and doubts If 'twere indeed of God the Faith she held, Or if 'twere haply best to live and serve The elder gods to whom their fathers knelt; And how 'twas sweeter far to know the love Of spouse and children, and the joys of home, Than to fling life away upon a dream, And feel the ravening tigers' jaws, the bite Of the keen flames, withering the flesh, the keen Thin knives, the crushing rack, and all the arts Of the tormentors' hands. But as they spake She with such faith reproved their perfidy That in despair they ceased. At last, in turn, With lucid thought and Heaven-sent utterance She bore on them; dressed with such precious robes The beauty of the Truth; spurned with such power The Pagan lie; showing with pitying love The misery of unfaith, the joys they lost Who did deny the Faith, knowing it true And having once believed; that suddenly, As self-convicted by the accusing voice Of their own selves, those weak apostate souls Shrank from her as from a consuming fire, And, grown repentant of their wrong, confessed Their fault, and, falling down before her feet, Besought her she would pray for them, and seek Remission of their sins; and she, indeed, With great joy kneeling with them, sought in prayer Forgiveness for their fault, and when they rose, She kissed them, and they went, with steadfast voice And joyful, openly confessing Christ. But when the tyrant learnt what thing had been, He gave command that those poor penitents Should die by fire before the virgin's eyes, That she might share their pain. The fierce flames leapt, The hapless sisters suffered, giving praise. And Dorothea watched their pangs, and cried, ‚ÄòFear not, dear sisters; suffer to the end, And take for price of those brief fleeting pains Eternal bliss in Heaven.‚Äô So they died firm. And she, in turn before the tyrant brought, Was doomed to instant death. But ere she died They racked her tender limbs, while she gave thanks And bore their worst unmoved; and then they led her To where the headsman with his gleaming axe Awaited her, and with him welcome Death. But as she passed, there rose the mocking voice Of one, a lawyer, who, when first the maid Was brought to judgment, mocked the words she spake Of the sweet flowers and fruits of Paradise, Which ever in the garden of the Lord Spring in perpetual beauty; nor doth there Snow come, nor frost, but evermore the heavens Smile on them, and they ripen, till they breathe Celestial odours fine, celestial hues Brighten them, and whoso shall take of them Shall taste eternal bliss. Seeing her pass, And mindful of her words, inflamed with scorn, His shallow witless mirth and Pagan spite Brake forth. ‚ÄòFair maiden hastening to thy Spouse, Send me, I pray thee, of the fruits, the flowers Of His celestial garden; for with us 'Tis winter, and no flowers nor fruits are here, But only clouds and snows and bitter winds, Scourging the naked fields. Send me of them, For fain am I to take them.‚Äô As he spake The maiden, bending, with a gentle smile, Answered, ‚ÄòI will.‚Äô And he, with scoffs and jeers, Turned with his graceless fellows, mocking her; But she went calm and cheerful to her death. Now, when she reached the place where she should die, She knelt awhile, bowing her head in prayer; And when she rose prepared for death, there came A precious portent. For beside her stood, To comfort her, a youthful Angel fair, With locks of gold, and eyes like autumn skies; And in his hands he bore, so runs the tale, A basket, and, within, three golden fruits Of Paradise, of scent and hue divine, And with them three fair roses, sweeter far Than the twice-bearing P√¶stine gardens bare, Summer and autumn. Then, with a sweet smile Of Faith triumphant: ‚ÄòPray you, good my lord, Carry these fruits and flowers to him who spake While I was passing to my death, and say, ‚Äú'Tis Dorothea sends them, and she goes Before thee to the garden whence they came, And doth await thee there.‚Äù‚Äô Then with the word She bent her gentle neck upon the block, And took the blow which sped her soul to Heaven. Now, as she died, the scoffing lawyer stood Among his comrades, jesting at the gift The maiden promised. But when now they sate Feasting, around them gilded images Of the false gods, taking no care nor thought For what had been, the torture and the pain, Lo! suddenly a heavenly presence showed, From whence he knew not, fair, with shining face, And locks of gold, and eyes as blue as Heaven, And in his hand a basket with the fruits And flowers of Paradise, who spake no word But, ‚ÄòDorothea sends them, and she goes Before thee to the garden whence they came, And doth await thee there,‚Äô and having said, Vanished as he had come. And the youth's heart Was touched with awe and pity, and he rose, And his heart melted, and he seemed to take Of the celestial fruit, as one who takes The Eucharistic bread; and straight his soul Rose to new life, and held the Faith, and owned The Holy Name, and bore like her his pain, And passed from pain to life, and gained the crown Of martyrdom, and is like her in joy.‚Äù And when he ceased, my soul within me cried, ‚ÄúOh, sweet celestial flowers and fruits divine, Which are good words and faithful deeds that spring From flower to fruit in Heaven! Shall any hear This precious legend with a heart unmoved By the ineffable gifts whose sign ye are‚Äî The flower of loving words, which can disarm The brute within our hearts; the precious fruit Of faithful deeds, which he who tastes and makes His own shall find indeed a heavenly food‚Äî Strengthen his strength, make clean his soul, and breed New thoughts within him, till his lower self, Sunk deep in sense, dull, gross, denying Heaven, Falls down from him, and, a new creature, comes To soar through suffering to a higher life.‚Äù And then there seemed a breach in the long ranks Of saintly lives. Till then I heard the tale Of martyrdoms where the fierce Pagan raged Against the nascent faith. Henceforth my dream Was chiefly of white lives, which gained the crown By too great scorn of self, and gave to Heaven Not of its own alone, but part of earth's, And yet grew bless√®d. Martyrdoms there were, Even as of old, when with fierce bigot rage Christian with Christian striving, plied anew The Pagan's hellish arts of pain and death, The dungeon and the stake, the rack, the sword, Seeking‚Äîoh, shameful thought!‚Äîto chase from earth The heretic God bore with. None of these I saw, or seeing, asked not of my guide, Because my soul grew sick, and could not bear The piteous tale. But of self-sacrifice‚Äî Lavish, indeed, yet blest‚Äîhigh sacrifice Vowed to great ends and blest, my ears were full, As one in pilgrim's garb, ascetic, seared, Still with some ghost of pain, and some faint trace Of sadness in his eyes, and yet withal, Despite his humble garb and lowly port, A Roman noble, met my curious gaze; And this the tale I heard: ‚ÄúWhen the first Innocent was Pope of Rome, A Senator there was, Euphemian, Who long with Agla√´, his wife, had prayed, Having great riches and no heir to take them, For offspring of their love. At length their prayer Was granted, and a son was born to them, Alexis, fair of body and white of soul. Him the blest vision through his growing years Failed not, but always on his life there shone The light of the Unseen, so that he fared Through all the heats of youth a soul unstained, Clothed in the spotless garb of innocence, And, 'mid the pomps of rank and riches, still Lived evermore in great humility As lived his Master, and still kept a heart Touched with compassion for the poor and weak; And, being purer than the rest, was fain, Through self-contempt and saintly diffidence, To mortify the sinful flesh, and make A daily penance for the wrong he loathed. Therefore, while outwardly in silks and gold, The emblems of his proud patrician birth, He showed before men's eyes, he bore beneath, Seeking to mortify this load of flesh, Next to his heart, a painful vest of hair; And, though he walked before men's eyes a bright And smiling presence, in his secret cell Bewailed with vigils and with tears the wrong He never did, a pure soul bowed and bent By the great burden of the sinful world. Thus sped the fleeting years, which crowned his youth With manhood. Never did his dreaming thought Turn to the earth or earthly things, but still The heavens stood open; the immortal youth Of the adoring angels dimmed the charm Of earthly beauty, and he lived apart, Like that rapt boy who saw as in a glass A fair reflected image in the stream, And loved it only. Then the sire and dame, Because they fain would see their noble tree Blossom before they died, would urge their son That he should wed, and named to him a maid Fair, modest, high of birth, higher of soul, Whom from a child he knew, and well had loved; And he, long time delaying, at the last, Being dutiful and fain to do their will, Assented, and the glad day dawned when they Together in God's house, bridegroom and bride, Knelt at the altar, and the vows were pledged And the words spoken which should make them one. So all day long the joyous marriage feast Sped gaily to the cheerful sound of song. But from his bride, her soft eyes looking love, The young Alexis stood apart, and mused As one whom some deep sorrow presses down; And through the long halls passing, sad, distraught, To all the greetings of the courtly throng Made hardly answer. For before his eyes Ever the beatific dream of old, The virginal whiteness of the saints, the pure Angelic faces bent before the throne, Filled all his musing thought, until the feast, The acclaiming friends, the mirth, nay, the meek face Of his young bride, showed dim and scarcely seen Before his rapturous gaze; nor could he brook The innocent thoughts of love fulfilled which flush The dreams of youth. Such thoughts were not for one Who had seen the opened heavens, the throng of saints, And the pure Virgin Mother; not for him The pulse of earthly passion. Could he dare To quench in deeps of sense the pale white fire Of the ascetic soul? Could mortal love Allure him from his heavenly home, or turn His duteous thought to earth? Nay, nay; he could not. A stern voice bade him fly, while yet 'twas time. And yet 'twas hard to leave the home he loved And those who loved him. But what said the Word? ‚ÄòWho leaves not father, mother, wife, and child For Me and for My kingdom, loves not me.‚Äô ‚ÄòLove I not thee, oh Lord? Shall not I dare To give all things for Thee? And yet Thy Word Bids each man, leaving all, cleave to his wife. How shall I dare desert her in her grief? How shall I bear to leave her to men's spite And mockery‚Äîa wife her husband shuns, A bride yet not a wife. And my dear sire, And gracious mother? Is not wedlock blest, And are they not of Thee? Do I not cast Reproach on those white souls, who lived in pure And blessed union? If our Lord on earth Dwelt in His father's house, and deigned to be In Cana, at the marriage feast, nor scorned To make the water wine, why should not I‚Äî Being but a worm, indeed, a thing of naught, Too low, too vile for Heaven, too weak for earth‚Äî Why should not I, taking my humble place In the great throng of life, foregoing all My dim celestial dream, bearing the cross In all humility, accept my part, Rearing my children in the fear of God And love of Christ, hastening the bless√®d hour When all the world is His, and He shall tread All earthly crowns beneath His feet and reign A King among His saints? Surely 'twere best To advance His kingdom thus? And then he turned Back to the joyful feast, and sate beside His innocent love, regarding well content Her fair unsullied beauty, and would strive To take the joyous greetings of his kin, And look with loving glances on his bride. So all day long the joyous marriage feast Sped gaily to the cheerful noise of song. And now the sun had sunk beyond the west, And night had fallen, when a dread voice seemed To summon him away, bidding him fly The world and worldly joys. So clear it came And awful to his ear, he could not stay, He durst not tarry. ‚ÄòI have need of thee, Alexis‚Äô‚Äîso it spake. And he, who heard The voice as of the Lord, without a doubt, Obedient to the heavenly summons, rose And sought his bride; and on her hand he set, In token of his love and troth, a ring Of purest gold, and round her slender waist A zone of precious gems, and on her head A veil of costly purple. Then in tears, The dread voice calling always, with one kiss He left her, and flung forth into the night, Unseen, and no man found him till he died Then through that hapless house there went a sound Of wailing. All the ways they searched to find The truant, but in vain; and straight their joy Was turned to grief, and they in garb of woe Sate mourning, without hope, the son, the spouse, Whom never should they see until the end. But when the bridegroom fled into the night, Leaving behind him light and life and love, Obedient always to the heavenly voice Which summoned him away, his faltering steps Led him to Tiber's bank, whereon he found A little boat; and, clad in pilgrim's garb, All night he laboured seaward, till he came To Ostia. There a bark in act to sail For Asia took him, and he crossed the deep, An exile self-pursued. No vain regret For vanished riches held him, or lost love, Or for the toil and hunger which he dared, Following the heavenly voice, and so content. Only at times some shade of doubt would come, Considering all his mother's love, his sire Left childless, and the sad surprise which filled His bride's sweet eyes when he would go from her, And how the house stood empty of delight, And how those innocent lives must pine and droop That he might do God's will; and all the load And tangle of the too-perplex√®d world! So, after storm-tost days, he gained at length The Syrian shore, and there long time he lived, A hermit, at Edessa, lone, unknown, Spending his days in alms, his nights in prayer, Till gradually through the land his fame Waxed, and the people's voice acclaimed him saint. Then he, who wept his vileness and was filled With saintly thoughts of deep humility, Fled once again, sailing across the sea For Tarsus, where of old the sainted Paul Hallowed the earth. But a great tempest rose, And drove the ship for many a darkling day Far from her course; and when the sky grew clear, Behold, the well-remembered coast again By Ostia, where the yellow Tiber stains The purple depths of the Tyrrhenian Sea, And, lost in distance on the northern sky, Rome and the stately palace of his sires. But when Alexis saw the well-known shore Hard by his ancient home, straightway his soul Was filled once more with doubt, because he knew That 'twas the Lord who ruled the storm, and drave The strong ship from her course; and when he mused On all the past, how the strange people turned His humbleness to pride, it seemed indeed That here was his best sacrifice‚Äîto live Within his father's house, unseen, unknown. For since long years of penury had worked Their will on him, and seared his cheek, and bent His body, and bleached his hair, and hardly left The embers of his youth, he might deceive The gaze of loving eyes. So he set forth, Wrapped in his pilgrim's cloak, along the still Dead marsh, a solitary wayfarer, Slow, leaning on his staff, obscured with dust And weariness, until, at last, with eve Rome and the stately palace of his sires. Now when he gained the lofty gate where dwelt His noble sire, the loved home of his youth And manhood, where his fair unwedded wife Still pined for him, the Lord Euphemian Went forth with all his pomp; and as he passed, Alexis‚Äîknowing all the work of time And toil and fastings, and his whitened hair, His furrowed brow, his straight form bowed and bent, His ragged garb, which was a robe of silk, And all the change, whose briefer name is age‚Äî Stood forth, and threw him at his feet, and sought Some humble food and shelter. And his sire, Knowing his son was meek and pitiful Of all the poor and weak, and how, perchance, He, too, was now a wanderer poor as this, Was touched with ruth and raised the suppliant, Bade him be of good cheer, and signed to them Who followed, they should give him food and place Beneath his palace roof, and, charging them That he should want for nothing, went his way; Nor knew he by his blood's unwonted thrill That 'twas his son he looked on. So once more Within his father's house Alexis lay. But those his careless menials, knowing naught Of what had been, and deeming him no more Than the poor wayworn wanderer he seemed, Beneath the marble staircase of the house, Found him some darkling cell, wherein he stayed Being gentle and of great humility; And seeing him so meek, no chiding word E'er passed his uncomplaining lips, they deemed, With the dull insolence of servitude, That 'twas some idiot, weak of speech and brain, Who lay there; and they plucked his beard and smote His patient cheek, and on his suffering head Heaped dust and ashes. But he spake no word Reproachful of them, knowing well indeed How great the load of his offence, and how The Lord of all was mocked upon the Tree. So in the house where he was heir to all, He lay long years, knowing the bitter bread Of penury, and cold, and all despite. Long years he lived, below the lowest slave In food and lodging, who was heir to all. But harder than all else it was to bear The daily, nightly sights and sounds of home; To see his mother, ageing day by day, Pass forth, still mourning for her son, and fear To meet the eyes which, had they met his own, Piercing his secret through, had ended all; To know himself the cause of grief and woe To her who bore him; yet withhold the word Which spoken had brought joy to innocent hearts! And most of all things was it grief to him, In the dead hours when all beside was still, Nightly to hear the sound of grief and tears, And know the voice of her who was his bride, Widow ere wedded. ‚ÄòWhither, love, art gone?‚Äô So wailed the voice; ‚Äòand wherefore didst thou wed, To leave me thus to mourn for thee, and bear Despite and scorn of men? Are we not one, Knit by the law of God,‚Äîone flesh, one soul, One being, fused by the mysterious word Which spoken joined our lives? Return! return! I weary for thy voice. Return! oh love! But thou art far across the pitiless seas, Or, haply, 'mid the sunless ways of death!‚Äô Night after night the wailings came and pierced His heart, and banished sleep, and wrung his soul With torture; for the suffering of the soul, Deeper than bodily anguish piercing, wears The writhing life. For sometimes he would dream He heard the voice, and then a mocking fiend Would chide him for his flight, and whisper, ‚ÄòRise. Duty lies plain before thee. Rise and seek Thy injured wife; ask pardon of thy sire, And her thy mother. Pride it was‚Äînaught else‚Äî Apeing contrition, drove thee, that thou wert Not as the world, the dim unnoted throng Of those for whom the trivial daily road Lies between lilies. Rise and take thy place, Bearing the wholesome load of common life, As did thy sires before thee.‚Äô Then the saint: ‚ÄòI may not know if I do right indeed, Such doubt o'erclouds my soul; but this I know‚Äî There is a whiteness in virginity; There is a virtue in the life withdrawn By desert sands or antred wilds, apart From wealth, and ease, and crowded haunts of men. There, on the vigils of the saints, the skies Stand parted sudden, and the Mother of God Opens her virgin arms and clasps her Son, Virgin like her; and round the throne there shine Angels and high archangels, row on row, Pure all and virgin; and below them stand The virgin martyrs. These my eyes have seen; These, when the desert stars shone clear and cold, And lions roared around the springs; these, too, These, when the hot noon quivered round the palms, The opening heavens revealed. And shall I bear To tread the flowery paths of life and sink To earthly joys? Nay, I am vowed, I am vowed! The fields grow white, the harvest of the Lord Ripens, and shall men dream of wedlock, now At the full end and judgment of the world? Then with divided soul Alexis rose‚Äî It was the dead of night‚Äîand through the long Hushed corridors, with noiseless footfall, sought, If haply he might see his love again, Himself unseen, the well-remembered door; And, pausing at the threshold, spied within His maiden consort, kneeling bathed in tears, Keeping a vigil for the man she mourned, And heard her loving lips pronounce his name In grief. ‚ÄòAlexis, whither art thou gone? Return, my love, return! Even where he stood, Hid by the arras, reached the wailing voice, And, by her lamp's dim light, he saw the lines On the belov√®d brow, which time and grief Had drawn, and all for him; and then great ruth And yearning took him, and he longed to speak. But while he mused, loud on his watching ear A voice, which seemed of God, arose and hushed All thoughts beside. ‚ÄòAlexis, be thou strong.‚Äô Then, with a groan as of a breaking heart, His grief burst into utterance, and sighed, ‚ÄòNo more, dear wife, no more!‚Äô And then he stole, Ghost-like, to his own place. But she who heard The words, and knew the voice, gazed with wide eyes, Then swooned, as 'twere his spirit greeting her; Nor slept, but with the morning told the tale, And, grieving deep, was somewhat comforted To think that he had come to her from Heaven. And he, when he had gained his poor retreat, Slept not. His suffering heart was riven in twain, His limbs refused their office, and his voice Grew feeble, as by sickness marred, or age. Nor from his humble pallet ever again Rose he, but sank, with every day that came, To deeper weakness still. At last he knew His hour was come, and so implored of one Who tended him, the means to write; and then A letter wrote he, setting forth at large The truth of all these things, and his sad life, And prayed forgiveness of his sins, and hid The scroll within his vesture, next his heart, And then his face grew calmer, and his eye As of a saint in glory. Till one day They found him in his poor cell, lying dead Clasping the letter, on his face a smile. Now, when Alexis lay in act to die, It chanced that very day Pope Innocent Said solemn Mass for C√¶sar, and the Court Knelt round, and, with the rest, Euphemian. And when the mystic sacrifice was done, And the proud concourse turned in act to go, From the high altar pealed a voice which said In solemn accents, ‚ÄòSeek the holy man Who this day comes to die, and ask of him His prayers for Rome;‚Äô and while in awe they stayed Expectant, then the strange voice once again‚Äî ‚ÄòGo, seek him of the Lord Euphemian.‚Äô And he, who heard it, knew not what the words Meant, but, the Emperor bidding him, went forth To gain his home, while after him there came C√¶sar and all the Fathers of the Church, With long-drawn pomp, the Pontiff at their head. But, when Euphemian gained his stately house, Lo! dark upon the gleaming marble stair The slaves had laid a lifeless body down To carry forth for burial; and they said To him who questioned them, ‚ÄòMy gracious Lord, This was the pilgrim whom thou bad'st us take Beneath thy roof years since, and he till now Hath dwelt here of thine alms. An hour ago He died, and soon we bear him to his grave; But in his grasp he holds a secret scroll Which never would he part with, night or day. See! will it please you look upon his face?‚Äô Then, with great awe, the Lord Euphemian Drew nigh the bier, remembering the voice Which sent him there and bade him kneel and ask A blessing of the dead, like him of old Who fed the holy angels unawares, And, marked with reverent eyes the pilgrim garb, The scroll grasped tight within the wasted hand, And all the marks of saintly poverty, Nor knew on whom he looked. But when he drew The face-cloth from the visage of the dead, His life stood still; for straight the father's heart, Through all disguise of penury and years, Leapt to his son. For, lo! the way-worn face Grew young in death, a smile was on the lip As of old time, but round the saintly head There shone a glory brighter than the day‚Äî Sign of his rank in Heaven; and on his knees The father fell before the son, and wept, Giving God praise. And while he knelt, there came C√¶sar and Pontiff, and they knelt with him; And the Pope reverently pressed the hand Stiffened in death, beseeching of the dead That he should give the scroll. And straight his grasp, Relaxing, yielded; and the Chancellor Read to the assembled nobles the strange tale Of Life and Death, which thou hast heard to-day. But when within the house the news was told, The childless mother and the widowed wife, Descending, threw themselves upon the bier, Kissing the wasted form; plunged deep in woe, Yet taking comfort that the dead they loved Reigned now among the saints. Seven days and nights They watched and wept before him, and a throng Of halt and sick, and many a one was healed Of his infirmity Such things the saint Wrought, with God's help, upon them for their faith. Then, lest some secular use might mar the place Made sacred by his pain, upon the ground Where stood that stately house, they reared the Church Of S. Alexis, and the marble stair Which sheltered him they left as when he died. And there a sculptor carved him, in mean garb Reclining, by his side his pilgrim's staff, And in his hand the story of his life Of virgin pureness and humility.‚Äù And, when the tale was done, again my guide: ‚ÄúShall any scoff, deeming the sacrifice Was vain, a sheer self-torment all unasked, Which wrecked four innocent lives? Does God then ask Such service of His creatures? Does He cast Contempt upon His gracious paths of life, Which all alike may tread‚Äîthe precious flowers Which, by the sacred light and warmth of home, Bloom fragrant to the skies; the childish eyes Which bring back Heaven; the priceless liturgies Of daily fruitful sacrifice; the joys Shared, and so doubled; all the bless√®d pain Of loss; the open grave; the sacred grief That lifts us from the earth? Nay, nay, our lives Are double, and our souls, as fitting those Who move from earth to Heaven. Life has its joys, And all may take them blameless. Yet there is A something higher, too, than these‚Äîa thrill Of ecstasy, a perfect path which hangs Heavenward upon the everlasting hills, Above the flowery meads, the harvest fields, The blushing vineyards, 'mid the perilous snows Where comes not life. Know we not well the snare Of wealth, the deep retributive pain of sense, Which ofttimes clog the sad wayfarer's feet Who treads life's common paths. Some souls there be Too fine and pure to tread them. Were it well That this brave heart had borne its share of love And rank and riches, and had lived its life, Making another's happy in like sort, And spent its little tale of common days, And passed and left no sign? Or was it best To have touched a high ideal unattained, To have grown from sufferance to high victory, To have left the world a story, which shall serve For ages yet, of soul defeating sense; Of aspirations flown too high for earth; Of life which spurns the binding chains of love, And lower weal, and blameless happiness, And soars aloft and takes the hues or Heaven?‚Äù And then it was a girl who seemed a youth, With pure sweet eyes, wearing a monkish garb, Within whose arms a young child nestled close, While she along the fields of Paradise Plucked lilies for it. Spotless innocence Shone from her, and around her comely head A finer motherhood. And thus the voice: ‚ÄúIn Egypt long ago a humble hind Lived happy. One fair daughter of his love Was his, a modest flower, that came to bless The evening of his days. But time and change Assailed his well-loved home, and took from him The partner of his life; and when the blow Had fallen, loathing of the weary world Seized him, and, leaving his young girl behind With some who tended her, he went his way Across the desert sands, and in a cave Long time he lived, a pious eremite Withdrawn from men. But when the rapid years Hurried his child to budding maidenhood, Knowing the perils of the world, his soul Grew troubled, and he could not bear the dread That day and night beset him for her sake; So that his vigils and his prayers seemed vain, Nor bore their grateful suffrage to the skies, Since over all his mind would brood a doubt For her and her soul's health, revolving long How she should 'scape the world and be with him, Because no woman might draw near the cell Of any pious hermit. At the last He counselled her, taking the garb of man, To come to him, leaving the world behind; And the fair girl, loving her sire, obeyed, And lived with him in duty to the end. And when he died, leaving the girl alone, The brethren of a cloistered convent near, Seeing the friendless youth, and pitying His loneliness, and holding high his love For his dead sire, offered him food and home Within the holy house; and there he served, A young man in the blossom of his age, Sweet natured, pious, humble, drawing to him The friendship of the youths, the love of maids But all his soul was rapt with thoughts of Heaven, Taking no thought for earth, and so it came The youthful Brother grew in every grace And great humility, and was to all Example of good life and saintly thought, And was Marinus to the monks, who loved Their blameless serving-lad, nor knew at all That 'twas a maid indeed who lived with them. Now, as in all humility he served, The Abbot, trusting him beyond the rest, Would send him far across the desert sands, With wagons and with oxen, to the sea, As steward for the House; and oftentimes The young man stayed far from his convent home, With some rude merchant who purveyed their food; And oft amid the wild seafaring folk His days were passed, and coarse disordered lives; And oftentimes the beauty of the youth Drew many a woman's heart who deemed him man. But still the saintly tenour of her way The maiden kept, serene, with innocent eyes, So that before her face the ribald rout Grew sober, and among the styes of sense Unstained she walked in spotless purity, A youth in grace, keeping a virgin heart. But one, the daughter of his host, would cast A loving eye upon him‚Äîall in vain; For careless still he went his way, nor took Heed of her love nor her, and oftentimes He would reprove her of his maiden soul, Knowing a woman's weakness, and would say, ‚ÄòSister, I prithee think of whom thou art, And set a watch upon thy feet.‚Äô But she, Hating the faithful candour of the youth, Fell into utter wretchlessness of sin; And when her sire, discovering her disgrace, Threatened her for her fault, a shameless thought Seized her, and she, with feigned reluctancy, Sware he deserted her, and with her child Came to the saintly Abbot, where he sate Judging the brethren. Then great anger seized The reverend man that at his heart he nursed A viper which thus stung him, and he cried, ‚ÄòVile wretch, who dost disgrace our holy house! Thou hypocrite, soiling the spotless robe Of saintly purity! I do denounce Thy wickedness. No longer canst thou be A brother to thy brethren here, who live Pure lives unstained. My sentence on thee is That thou be scourged, and from this reverend house Go forth in shame, and work what viler work The brethren find for thee; and this poor child Take thou with thee, and look that thou maintain Its growing life, since thus thy duty bids thee. Or if my mercy spare thee from the stripes Thou hast deserved, 'tis for its sake, not thine. Go, get thee gone, and never dare again Pollute my presence.‚Äô Long she strove to speak, But her lips formed no word. And then she rose Meekly, and, answering no word, went forth, Bowed down with shame, and yet not ill content, Deeming it but the penance which her sins Had merited. And when the little one Stretched forth its hands, she clasped it to her breast, Her virgin breast, and all the sacred glow Of motherhood, which lurks within the hearts Of innocent maidens, rising soothed her pain; And, wandering forth, she found some humble hut For shelter. There by alms and servile tasks, 'Mid great despite of all who knew her once In days of honour; hungry, lonely, poor, And ofttimes begging bread, she pined long time, Till the young life Heaven gave her, throve and grew In happy innocence, and all who passed Might hear twin voices mingling in the hymns‚Äî The father's, who was mother, and the child's‚Äî And wondering went their way. So that pure soul Grew tranquil, even on earth. Yet in her heart Deep down the rankling sorrow dwelt, and burned The sources of her being, and sometimes Her penance grew too hard, and almost broke The bonds of silence; then again her soul Took courage, persevering to the end, Knowing her sins, and how the pain she bore, Though undeserved, was nothing to the sum Of her offence, dear heart! and hoping from it The fair reward of utter faithfulness. But not the less the insults and the shame Consumed her life and strength, and day by day, When now the innocent she loved had grown To happy childhood, weaker and more weak, Her failing forces waned, till on her bed Stretched helpless lay the maid. And when she knew Her hour was come, she summoned to her side An ag√®d woman whom she knew of yore, What time she seemed a frank and eager youth, Ere her shame took her; and when she was come, Quickly with trembling hand she beckoned her, Giving her charge, when she was dead, to take Her child to the good brethren, with her prayer That they should keep it safe. Then with weak hand She bared her innocent virgin breast and smiled, A sad wan smile, and, looking up to Heaven, Breathed her last breath. And she who saw, amazed, With mingled joy and tears, composed with care The virgin limbs, and wrapped her in her shroud, And hasting to the convent with the child Left orphan, told the tale. And when he heard, The holy Abbot knelt with bitter grief All night before the altar, asking grace Of Heaven, that he had wronged that saintly soul By base suspicion; and the brotherhood Bewailed the pure girl-saint, who bore so long In bless√®d silence taunts and spite and shame, Obedient and in great humility.‚Äù And then it was a saint, still, as it seemed, Clad in monastic habit,‚Äîmany a hand Of painter limns him‚Äîwith dark beard and hair And melancholy eyes. Full well I knew The worn ascetic figure, bearing with it The lily and the lamb; the tearful gaze Which wept the sad world's sin, while the high voice Sang praise for all; the poet-monk who lit Of his seraphic ardour the faint fires And embers of the Faith. And thus I heard: ‚ÄúTo wealthy Bernardone and his wife, Madonna Pica, seven long centuries since, In fair Assisi, on the Umbrian hills, Was born a son, Giovanni, whom his fellows, Because he loved the joyous tongue of France, Would call ‚ÄòFrancesco.‚Äô Thence has come a name Through every Christian realm resounding still, Beloved for ever, and the ear which hears ‚ÄòS. Francis of Assisi‚Äô knows it takes A name in which all saintly memories Are stored as in a precious vase fulfilled Of spikenard, and the faithful listening soul Rejoices at its sound and is content. Now, when the boy had come to youthful years, Being his father's son, rich in all store Of gay attire, and filled with pride of life And luxury, yet would his generous heart Stand at the gate of pity, prompt to give If any asked; so that the citizens Loved the gay, careless youth for all his faults. Till, when he grew a stripling, a fierce feud Between Assisi and her sister town Of high Perugia, raging, burst in war; And the young Bernardone, with the rest, Bare arms, and, being taken, twelve long months Lay prisoner in the fortress. When the strife Was done and he set free, the burning grasp Of fever seized him, and he pined long weeks And months upon his bed. There, as he lay Hovering 'twixt life and death, his sobered thought Turned oft to Heaven, and all his reckless youth Stood up accusing, and a great contempt For this poor fleeting world and all its joys Filled his reviving life, and crowned his years With grave and sudden manhood; and he rose Leaving his former self, a higher hope Firing his soul than those low aims of yore. Yet outwardly he kept his wonted use Of splendour, and among the admiring throng Of his dear town he seemed to fare as erst A glittering youth, though 'neath his costly robe He bore a painful garment, till one day, Meeting some poor and humble wayfarer. He knew a noble comrade who had served With bravery in the war, leading the van With glory, but whom now some sudden spite Of Fortune left a beggar. When he saw The honoured face seamed with the lines of want And hunger, and the noble form obscured By rags and penury, the love of God‚Äî Which is the love of man‚Äîrose up aflame Within his breast, and hurriedly he stripped His broidered velvets from him, clothing round The naked, as his Lord commanded him, And with the beggar left his purse, and took His rags, and through the thronged street passed unmoved, Rapt by an ecstasy of sacrifice, And gained his home, a beggar in men's sight, But wealthy in the love of God and man. Thence ever in his breast the fire of faith Burned higher, till one day, within the shrine Of San Damiano praying, where he mourned The high church half in ruin; as he knelt, There spake within his soul a voice, which said, ‚ÄòBuild thou My falling Church.‚Äô And he who heard, Deeming it was the ruin where he knelt The strange voice bade him build, turning in haste To seek his father's house, sold of their store, And brought the priests the gold. But when his sire Was angered for the thing, he fled in fear, Doubting if he had heard the voice aright, Which bade him build the Church of God indeed, Not one poor tottering shrine; and when he came, After long days, worn, pale, in evil case, And hungry, all the people deemed the youth A madman, and his father prisoned him Within his house long time. But she, his mother, The mild Madonna Pica, came to him, And comforted her son, bidding him yield Obedience to his sire. Yet, though he loved His gentle mother well, the fire of faith Burned bright within him, and he spurned the world And its poor wealth. And when his sire at last, Being a worldling wholly, summoned him Before the Bishop, presently his son, Kneeling before the holy man, flung down His costly robe, as one who cast away All worldly wealth, and all the ties of earth, And gave himself to Heaven. And there he lay Naked, except his painful vest of hair, Until the old man, shedding grateful tears Of tenderness, stooped down and gently raised The suppliant, and round his young limbs cast His own white robe; and thenceforth the young life Died to the world, and lived for Heaven alone. Thus the swift years passed by and left him, man. And turning to the sick and leprous lives, He spent himself in pity; and found peace In happy daily labour, till his soul Filled with the bliss of living, and his joy And thankfulness and praise burst forth in song, As o'er the sunburned Umbrian hills he fared, He and his chosen Brother, year by year. Summer and winter, when the high-built town Glimmered in early dawn, and the thin towers Gleamed mistlike; or when now a golden rose Of sunset woke them, as it wakes to-day His high arcades, his convent cells, where towers, Leaving the files of sombre cypress-spires, Church over church; or when the valleys slept In twilight, and the shrill cicale chirped Among the olives, and the passionate song Of nightingales, from every bush and grove, Throbbed liquid through the gloom; then would his voice Rise clear to Heaven, and these the words he sang: ‚ÄòAlmighty Lord Most High, to Thee belong Glory and honour, and to none beside; No soul there is worthy to name Thy Name. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for Thy creatures, oh my God, And specially for him who gives us Day, The Sun, my brother; radiant is his face, And in his light we see Thy image, Lord. ‚ÄòI praise Thee, Lord, because Thy hand has made The Moon, my sister, and the countless host, In shining mail, which fills the lucid heavens. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for my brothers, Thy great Winds, For Air and Cloud, Thy Heavens serene, and all Thy seasons which give sustenance to men. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for my sister, the bland force Of Water, who, to serve the needs of men, Yields without stint her chaste and precious power. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for my strenuous brother Fire, By whose brave aid Thou dost illume the night; Jocund and fair is he, unquenched and strong. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for our bounteous mother Earth, Who keeps and nourishes our race, and gives A thousand kindly fruits to cheer our lives, Sweet flowers of varied hues, and every herb. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for the souls which, for Thy love, Forgiving evil, sorrow bear and pain; Bless√®d are they who meekly take Thy cross, And gain, oh Thou Most High! to wear Thy crown. ‚ÄòI praise Thee for our sister bodily Death, Whom none who live and breathe shall 'scape at last. Woe, woe to them who die in mortal sin! But blest are they, oh Lord, who do Thy Will; They shall not dread the great, the second Death. ‚ÄòThy Name, dear Lord, let all men praise and bless, And serve Thee still in utter humbleness!‚Äô Thus in an ecstasy of faith he lived, Begging his bread long time; for all his wealth He gave to build the churches which he loved, And in his narrow cell below the hill On which Assisi towers, hard by the shrine, Our Lady of the Angels, happy years He dwelt and pondered, till at length he knew His mission to the world, to preach, to call All people to new life, speaking the words God gave him, not his own. And everywhere There came a blessing on his work, and men And pious women listened, and his words Burned like a fire within their hearts. And last At Rome, the Pontiff, wondering at a dream, Wherein the pilgrim, of his strength, upheld The tottering Church, confirmed his saintly Rule; And he, with joyful heart returning, sought His lowly cell, and gathered round him all His Brethren of the Faith, and there he spent Long happy years of bless√®d Poverty. Likewise, because for faithful souls the lot Of God's dumb creatures presses with a weight Of wonder whence they come, and for what end, These humble helpers of our race, to whom Their master is as God, or how the doom Of nothingness awaits at last their good And honourable service; and because, Loving his Lord, he loved all creatures too His hand had fashioned; worm and creeping thing Upon his path he crushed not, but would set In safety; and the joyous songs of birds, The soaring lark, the passionate nightingale, He knew for hymns of praise, and oft would join His jubilant voice with theirs. Around his feet, As in the fields he walked, the innocent lambs Would gambol, and the timid fur-clad things Nestled within his bosom, fearing not His gentle hand. But most of all the birds He loved, the swift-winged messengers who pass 'Twixt earth and Heaven, and seem as if they bear A double nature, close in brotherhood With all he loved; and when he heard their song, Pierced through with joy and utter thankfulness, He with alternate praise would join with them, And once, with soaring antiphons at eve, Vied with a nightingale, till the brief night Was well-nigh spent, and he could sing no more, Since his voice failed him. And he bade the blithe Cicale chirping in the acacia thus, ‚ÄòSing, sisters; praise the Lord;‚Äô and hearing him, They shrilled their answering song, and he was glad. And one, the foremost of his band, there was, The Lady Clara, then and now a saint. She with the Master lived in grave discourse And holy converse, and one day it seemed, When at their frugal meal upon the grass She, with her sisters, sate around the saint, He with such sweet discourse declared the Faith, That they forgot their food and paused to take The spiritual feast, with eyes and hearts Raised up to Heaven; and all the folk around Marked how the convent and the low church gleamed With light which shone like fire, and, hasting there, Found the saints wrapt in silent musing thought, Forgetful of their meal, and knew the light Was but the fire divine of Faith, which burned Within those saintly hearts, and to their homes Turned wondering. But while he lived serene, Dissolved in happy tears, his soul desired The martyr's bless√®d palm, and fain would go Forth to the Paynim host, which then bore rule O'er all the sacred fields of Palestine; But a storm drove him back. Then to the Moor He yearned to preach; but grievous sickness came, And stayed his feet. Last, by the fabled Nile, He gave his body to burn if they would take The Faith of Christ; but when the Moslem heard, Deeming such sacrifice too great for man, He sent him home with honour. Not for him The martyr's palm, but to build up the Church By years of labour crowned with saintly death. Thus ten years passed, and then upon the plain Around his cell the Brethren of his Rule In thousands flocked from every Christian land, And by his triple Vow of Poverty, Obedience, Chastity, bound fast their lives, As the saint bade them, and to every clime Went forth his envoys. He it was who first, A rapt ascetic, with foreseeing mind, Brought to the service of the Faith the lives Whose path lay through the world, and the fresh zeal Of Woman, from the peasant to the Queen. Long from his place he governed far and wide His nascent Order, till at last, his soul Grown sick for Heaven and heavenly thoughts, he passed, Far from his brethren and the praise of men, To some lone cell on the precipitous side Of blue Alverno, high above the vale, Above the winding river, above the heights Of white Assisi, where his failing sight Might rest upon the everlasting hills. There, in rapt contemplation and fair dreams, He spent his soul. There, year by rapturous year, The heavens stood open to his gaze; the face Of the Madonna, with the Child Divine, Beamed on him. There the bless√®d Presence filled His yearning eyes. There, in an ecstasy 'Twas said, the failing body, strong in love, Like the pure soul cleansed from her earthy stains, Took his dear Master's wounds, and bore again The Passion; and the inmost Heaven, unsealed, Opening disclosed the Angelic Host and all The glories else unseen by mortal eye, Till, in seraphic ardour, the saint's soul, Throbbing with bliss well-nigh too great for earth, Wore thin the walls of life, and sickness came, And weakness, and his eyes grew dim with tears‚Äî Tears not of sorrow all, but mixt with joy For those his happy visions; tears of pain For the world's sin; tears of a faithful hope For Heaven and all the blessedness to be. There, when he knew his end draw nigh, he hailed The coming freedom; and, because his soul Was humble, ordered that his dust should rest Where, mouldering in unconsecrated ground, The malefactors lay. Then, with weak voice, Bidding them set him on the sweet bare earth Beneath the evening sky, he murmured low The Imploring Psalm, ‚ÄòTo Thee, Lord, have I cried; Thou art my hope;‚Äô and struggling to the close, ‚ÄòBring my soul out of prison,‚Äô straightway breathed His last pure breath. Then those who loved him bare His body to the tomb. And when they passed By San Damiano, all the sorrowing nuns, S. Clara and her sisters, weeping, knelt And kissed his hands; and that dishonoured grave, Since there a saint slept in the peace of Heaven, Grew honoured for all time and consecrate. And over him they built a stately church, Wherein, beneath a costly pillared shrine Of jasper and of sardonyx, he waits, Who was so poor in life, the Judgment Day, And named it by his name; and there, hard by, They reared a stately convent of his Rule; And church and convent, of the loving skill Of painters whom the Faith's reviving fire Kindled to Art, glow with celestial hues Of beauty. There the archaic simple hand Of Cimabue wrought. There Giotto dreamt His saintly stories, only part of earth, While the stern Bard of Heaven and Hell stood near With counsel, honouring the name he deemed ‚ÄòA sunrise on the world.‚Äô There, quaintly true, Orcagna, Cavallini, Gozzoli, Light the rich walls. There blooms the stainless thought Of the Angelic Brother, and the pure Rapture of Perugino, and the soul He reared, the wonder and despair of Art, Raffaelle, and a throng of names inspired Who sought not fame of men. And compassed round By those high glories lies the sacred dust Of him who, wedding saintly Poverty, Lived there long time despised, though now he soars Higher than earthly thrones, a Saint in Heaven.‚Äù Next came a queenly, youthful figure, clad In the Franciscan garb, a slender form With dark-brown hair and eyes, whose lap was filled With roses white and red, like those which crowned, In token of her purity and love, The brow of Cecily. Great tenderness And pity beamed from out her saintly eyes, And, kissing as she went, her stainless robe, Knelt many a soul her faithful voice and hand Had raised from earth to Heaven. As she came This fair half-legendary tale I heard: ‚ÄúTo Andreas of Hungary the Queen, His consort, seven long centuries ago, Bore one fair daughter. All the realm that year Was free from war, a bounteous harvest blessed The peaceful land, and with her came a saint To bless the Church of God. From her first years Saintly she showed and meek; no childish tear Of petulance she shed, and when she spake Her speech was as a prayer. All the broad plain Of Hungary rejoiced to see her grow Prudent as fair, and through the land the fame Of her young goodness spread and made men glad. Now, when King Herman, of Thuringia, learned This prodigy, he sent an embassy To Hungary to ask of Andreas His daughter in betrothal for his son Prince Lewis, and the messengers returned And brought the child with them, and, with her, store Of costly stuffs and jewels the far East And rich Byzantium yielded. And the King Loved the child well, and with her love she lived, Brother and sister; and her youthful heart Was filled with Heaven, and every day that came Brought its fair tale of saintly sacrifice, And more and more for God and in His fear She lived her girlish life, filling her days With pity and compassion, till she showed As 'twere some sweet child-angel whom the hand Of a great painter limns. Not as a child Of this poor trivial world she seemed, but grave, As one who strayed from Heaven to earth and found No meet companion. But the Prince loved well His young betrothed, albeit well he saw She was not as the rest, fearing sometimes Lest she might choose to be the Bride of Heaven, And not for him. Yet, while the good King lived, None dared to thwart the young Elizabeth In any work of pity, nor might the tooth Of envy touch her. But when death cut short His life, the stranger, now a friendless maid, Dwelt long forlorn, because the jealous Queen And her proud daughter Agnes, envying Her saintly life, with scoffs and jeers would mock Her sacrifice, and deepest contumely, So that her young and modest soul would shrink Within her at the cruel daily taunts Which marred her life; and all the courtly throng Marked her disgrace, and mocked her; and her sister, The Princess Agnes, jealous of her love, Would wring her heart, declaring that her brother Wanted no nun for bride, but would dismiss her To Hungary in shame. Such rankling shafts Of venom launched they as the poisoned tongue Of envious women can; and she, alone; Unfriended, bare it, nor complaining word Would speak to her betrothed, who marked it all In silence, nor yet spake, being indeed A youth as yet in tutelage, who owed Obedience to the Queen, doubting, maybe, Within his inmost heart if this pure soul Were not too high for earth and earthly love. But not the less his faithful love and trust Sustained her soul. No public word he spake Of comfort, but ofttimes, when she would sit In tears within her chamber, sick at heart For the despite and bitter contumely The others showered on her, her youthful lover Would come to her, comforting her with words; And when they were apart, his faithful thought Fixed on her still, he, coming, brought with him Some little gift she loved‚Äîa rosary Of beads, a silver crucifix, a chain Of gold in token of his love. And she, Loving him next to Heaven, would dry her tears And run to meet him, and throw girlish arms Around him, and would strain him to her heart And take his kisses as a maiden should Who loves and is beloved, and with good heart And cheerful bear her cross, nor cease at all From works of mercy, happy in her love. Now one day, as it chanced, her lover went With neighbouring princes to the chase, and stayed Longer than was his wont, and when he came, Or over-tired or busied with his guests, Brought not his wonted gift, nor did embrace His love with kisses; and the jealous throng Marked him; and she, perceiving with what joy They saw his coldness, found her fainting heart Sink in her, and she sent a messenger Who should enquire of Lewis and his love. And when he came, he found the weary Prince Lying at rest; and when he asked of him If he still loved the Princess, for the throng Had marked his coldness; springing to his feet, The Prince replied, ‚ÄòSeest thou yon lofty hill Which towers above us? If it were of gold From base to peak, pure gold, Heaven be my witness I would give it all for her. I love none other. I must have my Elizabeth; I love her Better than all the world.‚Äô And then he drew A little silver mirror from his purse, Wrought deftly, with an image of the Lord, And sent it her for gage; and when the maid Took it, she kissed with joy and reverence The sacred image, doubting him no more Till they were wed‚Äîhe a tall, vigorous youth, Of ruddy cheek, blue eyes, and royal port, And in his speech as modest as a maid; And she a budding maiden, dark of hair And eye, the large dark eye, which always glowed With inward light of love and charity, And which great pity for the labouring world Ofttimes impearled with tears. And so long time They lived together in happy wedded love. But she, within her royal cloister, still Kept her old penances, and oft at night She left her husband while he slept, and knelt On the cold ground, and oftentimes she scourged Her tender flesh; and he, who loved her dear, Would chide her, but in vain. Yet none the less She did fulfil her lofty courtesies, And rode out with him to the chase, and showed A Queen for all to see. Though when he went She donned a mourning weed, when he returned She, in her royal mantle clad, would greet Her spouse, and would embrace him as he leapt Down from his charger, every inch a Queen, Greeting her lord with wifely tenderness; Yet when they sat at meat, 'twas bread alone They served to her, and in her cup they poured Not wine, but water only, till her spouse Tasting the cup one day, it seemed to him The water of her saintly penance glowed Like some celestial wine pressed from the grapes Of Paradise, and not a word he spake, Because he held long time his wife was served By angel hands and fed on angels' food. And one day, when her lord had made a feast For all his brother princes, filled with pride Of his fair wife, and willing that his peers Should judge her beauty, he gave charge to her That, clothed in costly robes, a Queen to see, She should attend the feast; and she, who held Obedience more than all, arrayed herself In queenly garb. Upon her raven hair She set a glittering diadem of gems, And round her shapely form a royal robe Of green and gold, and o'er her fair neck threw An ermined mantle. As she issued forth From out her queenly bower to join her lord, Behold, a hapless beggar, spent with cold And hunger, met her, asking charity; And when he prayed her, in the sacred Name, To succour him, she, with the holy fire Of pity rising in her, stripped from her The ermine, and around the shivering form Wrapped it, and went, half doubting if her spouse Would pardon her. And when he came, she ran And, leaning on his bosom, told him all; And while he stood irresolute, behold, Her maiden with the mantle in her arms. ‚ÄòMadam, I found your ermine in its place; Did not your Highness need it?‚Äô Then she clasped it Around her; and her husband, as he heard, Knew well the beggar was the Lord of all; Willing to test her love and charity; And they together went; and all the guests Marvelled to see her beauty‚Äîsuch a light Shone from her jewelled mantle, and her head Seemed set with glory, and her tender eyes Lit with the glow of Heaven and saintly love. And one day, when she toiled amidst her poor At Eisenach, she came upon a child Outcast of all, because a loathly plague Of leprosy possessed him, so that none Would touch him. Straight she took him in her arms, Moved by a holy pity, and up the steep Carried him to her castle, while the throng Of courtiers shrank from her, and in her bed Laid him, and tended him with saintly love, Despite the old Queen's anger, all unmoved. And when her lord returned, and they would tell him What they had seen, he hurried to the place, Half in disgust, and snatched the coverlet Aside; and, lo! no leper child was there, Only the childish radiant form which lay Within the manger once at Bethlehem; And as they gazed the lovely vision smiled And faded, and was gone. Again, one day, When to her work she issued forth alone In winter down the snows, and in her robe, To feed the hungry, doles of meat and bread, Upon the frozen path she chanced to meet Her husband, and in jest he greeted her. ‚ÄòWhat dost thou here, my Elsbeth, and what store Lies hid within thy cloak?‚Äô Then, with a blush Of modesty divine, which lit her face With double beauty, she drew close her robe, Lest he should see. But he, with frolic mirth Persisting, drew it back, and in the fold He seemed to see, amid those wintry snows, Celestial roses red and white, which breathed A fragrance not of earth; and when he sought To clasp her to his breast, lo! from her eyes An awful radiance shone, too bright for earth And, bidding her go forward on her way, One heavenly bloom he took, and next his heart He laid it, and, with head declined, and slow, And pondering much, climbed to their royal home. In such good works she spent her saintly life. When famine vexed the people, and her lord Was with his liege far off, she opened wide The royal granaries to save, unasked, Those starving lives; and when the pestilence, A dread familiar following in its train, Seized them, her hand it was that smoothed the bed Of sickness, rearing costly hospices For all, but chiefly for the helpless pain Of children. When she walked among the throng, A tall young queenly figure breathing grace, The little ones would cling to her and lisp The sacred name of mother; and she stooped And cherished them, speaking with homely words Of comfort, and for them she sold her robes, Her gems, and all the precious things she loved, Nay, even the jewels of the State. And he Returning, when they came and made complaint Of all she lavished, with a smile would say, ‚ÄòNay, is my dear wife well, and are they well, My children? Ay? Then it is well with me. If she but spare my castle, it is well; Let her give alms.‚Äô And she, with all her brood, Came forth and flung her on his breast, and kissed Her love, and welcomed him with tender words‚Äî ‚ÄòSee, I have given the Lord what is His own, And He preserves us these.‚Äô Thus sped their wedded lives, till the sad year When, the third time, the armies of the Cross Sailed forth to fight the Crescent. At their head The Kaiser went, leading the princely throng, And Lewis with them. And the brave man feared One thing alone, to see his sorrowing wife Blanch at the news. Therefore the Cross he took Not on his breast he bore, but carried it Hid safe from prying eyes, because he dared not Witness her pain. But one fair summer eve, As they together sate within her bower, Asking of him an alms for some good end, Which he in jest denied, she with blithe heart Snatched his purse from him, and beheld within The Cross, and straight, knowing what thing it was, Swooned at his feet; and when her life returned, Weeping, she said, ‚ÄòDear husband, stay with me If God so will; and he, dissolved in tears: ‚ÄòDear wife, I dare not; I am vowed to Heaven.‚Äô Then she: ‚ÄòGod's will be done.‚Äô And so he went; And she a two days' journey fared with him Ere she could say ‚ÄòFarewell,‚Äô nor saw her eyes Her love again on earth; for when he reached The far Calabrian shore, burnt by the fire Of fever, to the nobles round his bed Commending his loved wife and children dear, Within the Patriarch's arms the Land-grave died. And she, when now the news of her lost love Came to her, swooned away, and lay for dead Long time, and at the last, a broken heart, Tending her infant brood, she bore to live; But when her shield, her stay, her strong support Was taken from her, then she 'gan to prove The vile despite they know who find the world, The ungrateful world, scorning their feebleness. From her proud castle home they drove her forth, Her and her children, and, amid the snows Of winter, down the rocky steep they went, A sad procession. In her arms the Queen Folded her suckling child, born when his sire Was dying far away and with her went Three faithful ladies, bearing each a child, Seeking some hind's poor hut; and as they went Down the rough slippery way, her weary feet Stumbling, upon the ground she lay, and then A thing in shape of woman, whom her hand Tended through sickness, mocked her as she fell. Yet not the less her sweet and patient spirit Was all unmoved to wrath; and, having found Some humble shelter, day by day she wrought At spinning for her children, whom her skill Furnished with food and clothing, till the knights From the Crusade returning, set her boy Upon his father's throne, and gave to her Marbourg for dower, where with her girls she dwelt Long unmolested. But a pitiless man, Conrad the priest, within whose bigot soul Pity nor mercy dwelt; whether to make Her life one penance, that he might increase His baleful power o'er that pure heart, or else Wishing to set her name among the saints, And his the honour, laid upon her soul Penance too hard to bear. He took from her Her children one by one, lest too much love Might hinder her from Heaven. He took from her The one delight of giving, which grows strong With waning life; and when she fain would take The vows of San Francesco, and would beg Her bread throughout the world, this too forbade; And when, with clothing torn and things of shreds, She, who was once a queen, through her own town Wandered, the children of her loving care Mocked her as one demented. Yet she bore All this and worse, meek and without complaint, Until the pious seemed to see once more The lowly Clara and revered a saint. Yet worse than all her unearned penances, The tooth of slander would invade her peace; And she, the saintly lady whose white life Was all of Heaven, leaving within the grave All earthly love, knew as a worldling might The breath of shame‚Äîshe whose fair delicate flesh Was scarred with lashes which the fanatic rage Of the dark bigot wreaked on her. And yet Her cup of suffering was not full; but last The dark priest took from her the faithful hearts Who, knowing her in honour, were content To cleave to her disgrace, and in their stead Sent two base creatures, who should make her drain Dishonour to the dregs, forbidding her The alms she loved, or that which was indeed Her second nature‚Äîher unsparing work Among the poor and sick. No marvel then That, ere her morning broadened into noon, Her great compassion, languishing and pent Like an undying fire within her soul, Burned with a quenchless longing, and consumed Her tender youth, which all her pains and stripes, The scourge of slander, nay, her dead love's loss, Slew not; or that her life, laid on a bed Of suffering, day by day waned low and lower, Nor ever again revived, but sank at last In that thick darkness which we christen Death. And when upon her bed she came to die, Being but four and twenty summers old, When she had lain twelve days or more, they heard Who tended her, a sweet and soaring strain Sound from her lips, as to the wall she turned Her wasted face. All her last day on earth She strove in prayer, till by the mystic food Her listening ear, enfranchised, seemed to hear Voices of angels, and the Mother of God In converse with her, and the sound of hymns Sweeter than any sounds of earth; and last, When now her strength had failed, one word she spake: ‚ÄòSilence!‚Äô‚Äîno more, as one who fain would hear The heavenly quires; and then she made response, ‚ÄòContempsi regnum mundi Domine.‚Äô And then the voices ceased, and she with them Closed her pure saintly life. And round her bed The people gathered, mourning, bathed in tears. Four days she lay unburied in the midst, While the crowd knelt and kissed. And on the site Of her poor home they reared the stately Church Of S. Elizabeth, and her shrine within, Built high on steps worn hollow by the knees Of countless pilgrims since, until the storm Of revolution burst, and violated Those sacred walls, and one of her own blood, The Landgrave Philip, came with impious hand And razed the shrine, and scattered far and wide The relics of the saint; and no man knows Their resting-place, but her soul rests with God.‚Äù Thus he; and then, with graver thought and voice, My soul within me burst in words and cried, ‚Äú‚ÄòBe good, be good!‚Äô‚Äîthis is the word that Heaven Proclaims, not ‚Äòhappy;‚Äô or if happiness Come, 'tis despite the pain the careless world Wreaks upon finer souls. Here there is strife, Injustice, suffering, and the cruel sense Of failure, when the victor's palm, indeed, Is theirs to claim. Death comes and takes our lives With half our work undone, and Faith itself Breeds its own errors and misguides the soul, And all our happiness seems sunk in night, Till the Great Dawn arising brings with it New heavens and new earth.‚Äù Then a form meek And pitiful, in manhood's early prime, With mild soft eyes, who wore the pilgrim's garb, The scallop in his hat, the staff, the scrip, The wallet, and yet seemed a noble still For all his poverty; and my guide said‚Äî ‚ÄúIn Languedoc, of noble parents came, When thirteen centuries were passed from Christ, A youth, who bore upon his breast from birth, Symbol of dedication to the Faith, A tiny cross. Him with all pious care His mother, Libera, for works of good And sanctity, through all his glowing youth, Trained year by year; and on his soul he bore The cross, as on his breast, and gave his life, His heart, his all, to Heaven. But not with him The pale ascetic fervours of the cell, Nor cloistered virtues lived apart from men, Where the rapt soul communes alone with God, Prevailed; but life lived as his Master's erst, Among the poor and weak, healing the sick, And filled with pity for the fallen lives Of sinners, raising them to light and hope‚Äî Life spending happy, and laborious days, Each bringing something of accomplished good, And sinking at its close in well-earned rest;‚Äî 'Twas this blest lot he prized. Thus, all his youth He lived in innocence. But ere he reached The gate of early manhood, Death, which comes To rich and poor, took from him at a blow His father's guiding hand, his mother' prayers, And he, an orphan, rich in lands and gold, Was left to work what work was his, alone Then with no pause of doubt, knowing the words Of his dear Master, and remembering well His answer to the youth who, rich as he, Would fain obey, straightway he gathered all His wealth, and of it to the poor and weak Gave part in alms, and of the rest he reared Hospices for the sick, wherein the skill Of wise physicians, working under Heaven, Might heal them; and he donned a pilgrim's garb, And then on foot, obscure, like any hind, Painful with staff and wallet toiled to Rome. But when his feet had left the Alpine snows, Crossing the Lombard plain, one eve, he climbed, Through groves of oak, to where, its slender towers Dark on the twilight glow, throbbing with noise Of loud-tongued waters hurrying to the plain, By Orvieto's city and sacred shrine, Acquapendente hung. But as he came, The nameless dread of some invisible ill, The unguarded city gates, the tolling knells, The sick and dying cumbering the ways With none to aid, the still, deserted streets, The sullen silence echoing cries of pain From the blind, close-shut dwellings, smote on him With a strange pity, and he hastened on. And when he asked of one who fled, what ill Befell the town, ‚ÄúThe plague!‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúthe plague! Fly too, or thou art doomed.‚Äù But he who heard, Without a moment's doubt, filled with great ruth And eagerness, pressed onward, as a player Who knows and loves his part, and round his feet Dread signs of death and suffering everywhere Grew thicker, till at length he gained the gate Of the great hospice, thronged from floor to roof With hopeless pain. Then, in an ecstasy, He entered, and besought that he might serve; And they consenting, he, with fervent prayer And great compassion, and the finer skill Which Faith can breed, and comfortable words, And signing with the Cross where'er he came, Heartened those helpless sufferers in such sort That many, whom now the instant might of Death Held in its grasp, escaped; and presently, The fierce infection waning, all the land Revered the youth, so young, so beautiful, So fearless and devoted, and they grew To hold him more than man, till to their thought He showed as 'twere an angel sent from Heaven To bid them live. Thence fared he through the land Of the Romagna. There by field and town Was pestilence, and he was in the midst, Dauntless amid the harm, tending the sick, Himself unscathed. And thence to Rome herself, Where too was plague; there three long years he wrought 'Mid scenes of death and pain, tending the sick, Always unscathed, and wheresoe'er he went A blessing went with him upon his work. Yet one incessant prayer his faithful lips Would breathe to Heaven, if only he might earn The martyr's palm: but never at all there came An answer to his prayer, nor could he die, Nor be at rest, for God had need of him. Thus, year by year, from town to suffering town He journeyed, still unscathed, rapt by good works Of mercy. At the last his footsteps came To fair Piacenza, where a dreadful ill Consumed the people. There long time he served, Tending the sick. There, too, a blessing came Upon his work, till one sad night he sank, O'ercome by toil and watching, on the ground; And when he woke, a burning fever raged Through every vein, and on his breast, behold, A horrible tumour. Then, because his pain Had grown too great for silence, and he feared To wake the suffering sleepers, he crawled forth And laid him down to die; and when the guard, Fearing the plague, constrained him, slowly crept, Tottering in pain, upon his pilgrim's staff, Beyond the city gates, to a thick wood Where no man came, and there prepared to die. But not yet came his Fate, for some poor hind Succoured him, and would dress his wound and bring His daily food, or, as some tell, there came A bright angelic form to comfort him, And he was healed; and when his strength returned, Exulting in his soul that he was found Worthy to suffer for his Lord, and filled With holy pride, he rose and took his way Across the swelling Apennines, the plains, The Alpine snows, clad in his pilgrim's garb, A worn and weary man, bent by long toil And wan from mortal sickness, till he gained His own fair native land; and to a town Which was his own, and all the country folk His vassals born, he came, so changed and bent By long and suffering years, no living eye Knew him, and 'midst the people who were his The pilgrim walked unknown who was their lord. And he, because he scorned to take again His lordly rank, but rather chose to be In great humility and serve unknown The suffering race of men, would speak no word Of recognition, but, a stranger still, Passed through the country side, nor claimed his own, Loving the saintly poverty which brought His soul to God, and set him free to move Lowly amongst the lowly, doing good. Then, since great strifes and bitter jealousies Vexed all the country side, the folk who deemed His pilgrim's robe no other than a cloak To hide the traitor, haled him to the judge, His father's brother. No defensive word He spoke, nor knew his kinsman, whom he doomed To lifelong prison. And the pilgrim, glad Of salutary pain, and holding all Was of God's will‚Äîthe judge's ignorance Of his own blood, and all his punishment‚Äî Kept silence till the end, and to his cell And chains went silently, who for a word Had been set free with honour. There he pined, In a close dungeon pent, long weary years, Leaving his fate to Heaven. And when his hour Was come, the jailor, taking to his cell His bread and water, found the prisoner lie Dead on his pallet, and around his head And from his wasted face a glory shone Which lit the gloom, and by his side a scroll, Writ by what hand none knew: ‚ÄúWhoever dreads The pestilence that stalketh through the night Shall seek the intercession of the saint Who lies here dead‚ÄîRoch, Lord of Languedoc. Then in a moment, looking on the face Of the worn pilgrim-prisoner dead and cold, They knew again the ardent, generous youth Who, gay with robes of price and gems and gold, In the first bloom of manhood, beamed on them And gave up all for Heaven, and tender ruth For dim afflicted lives whom the hard fate Of hopeless sickness took. And so their eyes Were opened, and the judge, his kinsman, wept His hapless fate, stricken with a deep remorse For what had been; and, touched with vain regret, His vassals laid him in a costly tomb With tears and lamentations; and they thought That from the sacred relics of the dead, As when he lived, there went a virtue forth In plague and sickness, so that still he seemed To heal them. And when now a century passed, The strong sons of the Mistress of the seas, Who languished oft beneath the dreadful scourge The seething Orient bred, sailed out and snatched His sacred dust, and forth, with pious care And honour, all the fairy city came To meet them; and above him. presently, They reared a church in honour of the saint San Rocco, and a pitiful Brotherhood, Named by his name, to aid the poor and sick, Wherein the proudest noble joyed to serve‚Äî The Scuola di San Rocco,‚Äîand a house Stately as any which the enchanted sea Exhales in dreaming Venice. There the skill Of Tintoretto and his scholars limned On wall and ceiling stories of our Lord, His Death, and his Ascension to the skies, With lavish hand, so that it glows today A miracle of Art, which fitly frames A statue of the saint; and there he stands, As stands his soul, among the heavenly host, In honour now, who died a prisoner here.‚Äù Next 'twas a woman, bearing in her hand A lily. Round her maiden limbs she drew The habit of S. Dominic. Her worn face Bore anxious traces still, as that of one Whom, loving best the cloister, the sad world Calls to its service and denies to Heaven; And I bethought me of a cloudless noon By Fonte Branda, 'mid the merry talk Of thirsty peasants, while the churches towered High on the rocky spurs, and her low home Showed like a sacred shrine, where the saint once Doubted herself, not God. And thus the voice: ‚ÄúIn fair Siena, on the Tuscan hills, Giacomo Benincasa lived and died Five centuries ago. To him were born, And his wife Lapa, many stalwart sons And fair-grown daughters. One, their dearest child, Was Catharine, latest born and best beloved, So fair, so blithe, so sweet in infancy, The neighbours named her name Euphrosyne. But as she grew, no longer the young maid Showed as her comrades, but the world unseen Made grave her gaze and checked the innocent flow Of girlish laughter, and the pictured tales Of saintly lives within the incensed gloom Of the great churches drew her childish feet With a strange charm. For one day, as she came, Being but seven summers in the world, She and her brother, from some natal feast, They sate at sunset on the rocky hill By Fonte Branda, and as Catharine gazed On the tall campanile of the church Above her, lo! beyond the slender shaft, The heavens stood open, and her wondering gaze Saw our dear Lord in glory, and the saints Around Him. As she looked upon the sight In ecstasy, her eyes grew fixed, and she Gazed on, unconscious that her brother's voice Called to unheeding ears; and when he turned And drew her from her place, she saw no more The opened heavens, and, sobbing from her heart, Sank on the ground with bitter childish tears. Nor ever from her thought the wondrous dream Of that blest evening faded. More and more Silent she grew, and grave, and wandered forth In solitude, if haply once again That glorious vision took her longing eyes; But never more it came. But she, who read The tale of Catharine and the sponsal ring Which bound her to the Lord, prayed if perchance She also might be His; and when she came To her full age, being sweet and beautiful, Her parents, loving not her penances, Her fasts, her vigils, her ascetic dreams, Would give their girl in marriage; but her soul, Fixed on that heavenly bridal, took no thought For earthly love, and still her days were spent In solitary prayer. Then, that hard toil Might check her wandering dreams, her parents laid Hard household tasks upon her, loading her With mean and weary toils, and all the house Mocked her and jeered; but in her heart she kept This comfort‚Äî‚ÄòWere not, then, the bless√®d saints Mocked even as I, and shall I be ashamed To bear as they did?‚Äô To her humble tasks She bent her unrepining; food and rest Almost she took not, yielding place to prayer; And, lest her fairness might allure the eyes Of youthful lovers, from her shapely head Sheared the luxuriant treasure of her hair, To lay before the altar, offering all Her youth, her life to Heaven. Thus she lived A recluse self-ordained; but still her sire Urged her to wed, till one day, to her cell Chancing to come, it seemed a snow-white dove Hovered above her as she knelt, and then The good man, fearing lest his will withstood The Spirit which thus visibly guided her, Entreated her no more, leaving her free To do Heaven's will. And to the holy house Of Dominic she went, and there she sought To serve, a penitent, but never yet Made full profession, though she found no less A penance for herself. On a bare board She lay, a log her pillow, and no word For three long years she spake; but from her cell High in her father's roof, with earliest dawn, And when the darkening ways grew dim with night, Daily she climbed the steep where the high Church Of San Domenico towered, by whose tall shaft She saw Heaven opened once, and there she knelt Before the altar rapt in ecstasy. But not yet found she peace or rest, for still The Enemy of Man spread for her snares To take her fast. Thoughts sent he to her soul Like fiery darts, thoughts which she deemed of sin, Such as assailed the bless√®d Anthony. Or was it, surely, that to this white life The dreams of blameless love, and hearth and home, And the soft hands of children at the breast, Seemed perilous for ill? But when they came, She prayed anew for help, she took not food, She scourged herself before the altar-place Till her blood flowed. And when she called for aid At midnight in the lonely church, she seemed To see a visible Presence walk with her, Speak to her words of sweetness, comfort her As One alone might comfort, flood her soul With faith, till, as she walked, the darkling aisles Glowed with warm light, and the chill pavement smiled Decked with sweet summer flowers; and evermore The gracious accents of a voice Divine, Filling her ears, made precious melody, Waking the ghostly solitude with sound, And bless√®d faces bent, and blest hands swept Celestial lyres unseen. And then sometimes They came not, nor the Presence, and her soul Fainted within her, lest those heavenly dreams Were naught but snares, unreal fantasies Sent of the enemy to take her soul‚Äî The dreams which bind the saintly dreamer fast (Like siren voices sounding o'er the sea, Which whoso heard, nor fled nor stopped his ears, Lay bound for ever and lost); nor ever again The healthful daily load of duty done Allures, nor honest toil, who pines in chains Self-forged, a prisoner to his brooding thought. And so she turned from penance and from fast And bless√®d contemplation to the tasks Of Christian duty. To the poor and weak She lived a servant. One poor wretch there was, Sick of a hopeless ill. For her she bore Through wintry nights, on her bent back, the load Of fuel for her fire. Another, white With leprosy, she succoured where she lay Houseless without the walls. In her own bed She laid and tendered her, till on her hands The hopeless evil showed. Yet naught she earned Of gratitude, and when the leper died, She only, and none other, durst prepare Her corpse for burial; and, behold, her hurt Was cleansed from that same hour! And on a day When from the town she went on some soft task Of mercy, through the city gates there came A sad procession; for a robber went Forth to his shameful doom, rending the air With blasphemies and wild despairing cries, While in his wake the angry people surged With curses; and her tender saintly heart O'erflowed with pity, and she took her place Beside him, speaking with such gracious words That his hard heart was melted, and confessed His heinous sin and its just punishment. And while she knelt in prayer, forgetting all, Lo! the poor penitent, ‚Äòlike a gentle lamb,‚Äô Went tranquil to his death, and she who saw, Calling him ‚Äòher sweet brother,‚Äô laid his head Upon the block; and when the keen axe fell, She sate, his severed head within her hands, All bathed in precious blood, while her rapt eyes Saw the saved soul borne upward into Heaven. In such fair works of love the virgin saint Spent her pure days, till through the land her fame Spread far and wide; and when the Florentines Grew rebels to the Church, the Pontiff named her Arbitress of the strife, confiding to her The terms of peace. But when she made her way To Florence, straight a tumult, and she hid, Learning too soon how base the ingrate throng, Within the cloister. 'Twas her voice which called The Holy Father home, her woman's voice‚Äî None other. Weighty matters of the State Were hers to adjudge, untrammelled, as she would; So that the visionary girl of yore Rose to the stately woman, ruling well, As might a Queen, in honour and fame of men. But in the midst of all the pomp, the glare Of rank and power, still would her yearning gaze Steal backward to the days, now long ago, When painfully at midnight up the steep Her feet would climb, and in the towering church Pour out her innocent soul, and feel the breath Of Love Divine upon her cheek, and walk Encompassed round with Heaven and the fair dreams Which could defy the morning and waxed strong Even in the blaze of noon; and she would prize The contemplative life, the silent thought, Which there she knew, above the clamorous din And turmoil of the world, the hopes, the fears, The slanderous tooth of secret enmity, The envy of false friends. And so deep care, Wearing away the chains which held her life, Laid her at last upon her bed, and broke, Before her footsteps trod life's middle way, The silver cord, and loosed her soul to Heaven. But as she lay in act to die and knew Her end drew near, one word she spoke alone‚Äî ‚ÄòNay, Lord, 'twas not vainglory, as they say, That drew me, but Thine honour, and Thine alone; And thou, Lord, knowest this it was, not pride.‚Äô And so she passed away.‚Äù But when his voice Was silent, all my soul broke forth in words Of Love which conquered Doubt. ‚ÄúDear spotless soul, Still through thy house men go, and wondering mark Thy place of prayer, thy chamber, and thy cell. Here 'twas the Lord appeared, and gave to thee His sacred heart. Here, in this very spot, Thou clothedst Him as He sate in rags and seemed A beggar. All the house is filled with thee And the white simple story of thy life; Still, far above, the high church on the hill Towers where, in prayer, thou seemedst to walk wrapt round By an ineffable Presence; thy low roof Is grown as 'twere a shrine, where priest and nun And visionary girls from age to age Throng and repeat the self-same prayers, thyself Didst offer year by year. Comes there no end Of yearning for our race on earth, nor stay Of penance, nor unmingled happiness Till Heaven is gained? or in high Heaven itself Can fancy image, or can faith sustain, No shadow, nor satiety of joy? I cannot tell, I know not, but I know 'Tis not for happiness we are, but God.‚Äù And then I saw a reverend figure come, Walking with meditative steps and slow, Who listened as the blest Cecilia erst To high celestial music, else unheard; And straight I knew the Priest, from whose full heart Welled a clear spring of quaint and sacred song, And seemed again to tread the dewy meads Of Sarum, and to see the thin spire pierce The sunset skies, as I by Bemerton Strayed rapt in thought. And as we passed, my guide: ‚ÄúNot of one Church, or age, or race alone The saints are born, nor of one clime they come, But 'mid the grass-green English landscapes dwell Pure saintly souls, as by the slender towers Of olive-grey Assisi, or white shrines Washed by the purple sea. There, walked on earth The saint thou seest, high of birth and name, Yet lowly as his Lord, when once he gave His life to Him, and with each day that dawned Renewed his saintly vows, and lived content For the brief years Heaven would. Not always turned His soul to Heaven; the splendours of the Court Dazzled his youth, and the fair boundless dreams Of youthful hope. For he, by name and blood A noble, 'neath our Abbey's reverend shade, Amid the cloistered courts of Westminster, Drank with deep draughts the lore of Greece and Rome, And then within the time-worn Halls which watch The slow-paced Cam; and there his studious eyes Kept nightly vigil, and his sweet shy Muse Tuned her clear voice for Heaven, a stainless youth Who to his loved and gracious mother vowed The firstlings of his song. For him the flow Of sweet concordant descants soothed his soul Till Heaven stood open. But not yet his thought Turned to the Altar, since in high respect And favour of his king, he stayed to take What high advancement his unwearied thirst For knowledge, and his gay and polished wit, Wielding the tongues of France and Spain, and thine, Great Dante, and his courtly presence clad In robes of price, might offer. Then at length, When now his growing soul grew sick of Courts, Yearning for Heaven, the hand of Death removed His potent friends, and last, the king himself; And one by one the fetters broke which bound His soul to earth, and soon he turned to hear His mother's pleading words; and, stronger still, The voice within which called him set him free‚Äî Free from himself and wholly vowed to God. Then, when the courtiers scoffed at him and bade him Pursue some nobler life and worthier, Thus made he answer: ‚ÄòThough the sacred name Of priest be now despised, yet will I strive To do it honour. All my little store Of learning cheerful will I yield to Him Who gave it, grieving sore I yield Him naught Who made me His. Oh, let me strive to be Likened to Him, and make Humility Lovely in all men's eyes, following still My merciful meek King.‚Äô So he became A servant of the Altar, for awhile A deacon only, fearing yet to take The priestly office. At the last, when now His struggling years had reached life's midmost way, Whence turn our faces homewards, weak in frame Though strong in spirit, 'mid the golden meads He ministered a priest, where the gray spire Of Sarum points to Heaven, and consecrates The rich low vale with grace. There he should see Three brief and saintly years before the end. There from him all his courtly robes, his silks, His sword, he put away, and in the garb Of priesthood did indue himself, and vow His contrite soul to Heaven. Within his church, With all doors closed, he passed, as the law bade, To take full seisin, and, their pastor now, To toll, with his own hand, the bell which called The faithful. Then because he came not back After long hours, they sought him, and, behold, Through the low casement looking, saw the saint Prostrate before the altar, rapt in prayer For strength to do God's work; and there he framed His rule of life, and vowed to keep it still. Even so the good Priest lived his tranquil days, His saintly helpmeet working with him still In alms and prayer. Daily the orisons Of those pure souls, and theirs who dwelt with them, Three orphaned girls, rose morn and eve to Heaven, Following the sober uses of their Church, Matins and vespers. All the country side Loved that white life, and knelt with reverent hearts Whene'er within the little oratory The daily Liturgies were sung. The hind Paused at his task when o'er the neighbouring leas, Summer and winter, thrilled the solemn bell That called the saint to prayer, and oftentimes, Touched by some new devouter impulse, left The patient oxen at the plough, and knelt Awhile within the reverend walls, and took The good man's blessing, and returned with strength Fresh braced for toil. Thus he, within a realm Whereon the coming shadow of strife and blood, The fanatic's guile and hate, the atheist's sneer, Brooded already, and the darkling stain Of worldly ease, and sloth, and sensual sin, Renewed the pure devotion of a Church Stripped of its Pagan gauds and robed for Heaven. Ah! saintly life, for which the round of praise And duty was enough, far from the din And noise of Courts; for which to praise the Lord And feed His helpless poor sufficed to fill The days with blessedness! I hear thee yet Bid the poor wife who stammered forth her need Be of good cheer, nor fear to tell thee all. I see thee, clad in courtly silks erewhile, Stoop when thy neighbour's wagon, with its load Of humble produce, on the rugged way To Sarum fell, raise him, and from the mire Replace his burden with long toil, and then, Giving an alms and bidding him take heed, Even as he loved his soul, to spare his beast, Pace half-unconscious the astonished street Of the prim city, miry, unashamed. Ah! yet I see thee clearly, when the strain Of unheard rhythms filled thy happy ears, Wander from field to field; and on the road To the great Minster, when thy soul had need Of new refreshment, ever on thy way, Hoarding faint echoes of a voice Divine, Glow into servent verse, and stone by stone Build up thy ‚ÄòTemple;‚Äô and anon sit rapt, Leaving thy humbler liturgies awhile, Within the heaven-kissed fane the centuries Mellow, and listen to the soaring chant Sung daily still, the jubilant anthem's voice Of praise, the firstborn precious harmonies Of England's sacred song; the o'ermastering joy Of the full organ-music glooming deep From aisle to aisle, or caught from height to height, Till lost at last as at Heaven's gate, and thou And thy rapt soul floated with it to joy. Ah! bless√®d blameless years, to which too soon Stern Nature set her limit. Thy weak frame Three little years of too great happiness Strained first, then wore out quite; thy failing strength First to the Minster might not bear thee more To foretaste Heaven. Then to thy lowly church No more thy footsteps fared. Thy oratory Thou still didst keep; and each succeeding day, Matins and vespers, would thy feeble voice Give praise as thou wert wont, nor would thy soul Deny, while still thy body could, her due Of worship to the Lord who succoured thee, Lauding Him always. Last, when now 'twas grown Too weak to serve, a faithful priest and friend Said the loved prayers, while thou with thankful heart Listenedst and wert content, and on thy lips Hovered a saintly smile! Now when his life Flowed nearer to its sea, there came a priest, Sent from his lifelong friend of youth and age, Nicholas Ferrar. ‚ÄòPrithee,‚Äô cried the saint, ‚ÄòTake to my friend this message. God is good, And just in all His ways. Of His great grace I do rejoice in that which pleaseth Him, Ay, even to wane and die. Tell him my heart Is fixed on Him, and waits the appointed change With hope and patience. Sir, I pray you, give him This little book, the portrait of long strife Betwixt my soul and Heaven, ere yet I took My Master's name, wherein I now go free. See, it is called ‚ÄúThe Temple;‚Äù it and I Are less than His least mercies. Bid him, sir, Burn it, if judged unhelpful to weak souls. I prize it not. I look back from this place On my past life, the music that I loved, The beauty I held dear, the pleasant talk Of books and men, and all are but a dream And unreturning shadow, and I know I go, as did my sires, to make my bed In darkness; and I praise the Hand which gives Such patience to me now, and brings me safe Through Death's dark gate to Heaven.‚Äô And he, when come To his last earthly Sunday, suddenly Rose in his bed, and, taking in his hand His viol, once again with feeble voice Sang his own hymn: ‚ÄòThe Sundays of Man's life, Threaded together on Time's string, Make bracelets to adorn the wife Of the Eternal Glorious King. On Sunday Heaven's gate stands ope, Blessings are plentiful and ripe, More plentiful than hope!‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúMore plentiful,‚Äù I cried, ‚Äúand poured from no unfruitful horn. Ay, but thy hope was great, pure saint, who thus From out thy dying chamber wentest forth Cheerful into the void, and didst defy The Enemy, yielding thy grateful soul Into His hands who gave it. Shall thy life Fade from our thoughts, dear heart? Nay, while thy clear And yearning soul distils in verse that breathes Fresh odours of the Heaven it loved, and decks With quaint conceits thy Church, thy Faith, thy Lord, As erst the kneeling kings who honoured Him With frankincense and myrrh; nay, while the spire Thou lovedst, still points its finger to the skies, And this our England keeps her sober faith‚Äî Not of the zealot born, nor of the priest‚Äî And men still prize the gentle life and path Of contemplation, lit with flowers of good, And scented sweet with praise and works of ruth And charity. The fashion of our lives, Our thoughts, our faiths, our Heaven may suffer change, But this one never.‚Äù Next it was a man With ruddy face and fair hair sprent with gray, And somewhat stern of aspect, till he spoke‚Äî A tall and vigorous form, a little bent By too long prison years, in modest garb A Puritan; who next in time was born To him whom last I saw; differing in all, In mien, in thought, in speech, yet each inspired And saintly. As I looked I seemed to know The wondrous peasant, who by dreaming thought, Fine as the Bard's who sang of Heaven and Hell, Lightened his long duress, and for our aid Has left a record of the Pilgrim soul Faring to Heaven by rough and perilous ways, Which myriads since have trod. And thus my guide: ‚Äú‚ÄòPoor and of meanest rank, and most despised,‚Äô At Elstow, in the dewy, daisied fields Hard by the dreaming Ouse, was born the saint Thou seest, ere yet the clang of civil strife Frighted our land, and 'neath that large bold will Which swayed the Commonwealth, his budding life Ripened to manhood. In his father's home, A humble cottage, with the timbered walls Of older England, grew the stalwart youth Whom blameless strength and rude untempered force Urged sometimes headlong, prizing overmuch The sports his skill made dear; the flying ball Winged by the tireless arm; the joyous toil Of emulous comrades when the deafening peal Swung from the reeling tower, and bell with bell Mingled reverberant chimes; the village green When from the short sweet grass the merry din Of youthful voices rose, till the tired sun Lengthened the shadows, and the faint young stars Relit the fading skies. And oftentimes, In hot impatient haste, his careless tongue Would break in reckless and unmeasured speech, And oaths profane, till sober hearers shunned The rude wild youth. And yet his life was pure Of grosser sin; the Fiends of Drink and Lust Allured him not; only his headlong age Possessed his life too much, and hurried him By earthly flower-set ways and far from Heaven. But not the less his self-accusing soul Suffered for his offence. Visions by night Oppressed his boyish sleep. He saw Heaven's dome Aflame with fire, the boundless firmament Shivered by mighty thunders; over all The loud Archangel pealing, and a throne Set in the East, whereon sate One whose face Shone like the Morning Star. Anon the earth, Rent by a terrible earthquake, sank with him Into the nether hell, 'mid the dread sights And sounds of doom, when suddenly there came One who, on shining wings descending, snatched His fainting soul from that accursed throng; And lo, it was a dream! Soon, when the storm Of warfare burst upon the Midland fields, A boy in years, against the faithless king He served a soldier, for the cause he loved, And saw his comrade at his side fall dead, Shot through the brain. Yet when that bitter strife Was ended, to his old rude life he turned, As reckless as of old, until he found A sweet girl-wife, devout, whose simple faith Loving the ancient worship drew his feet Sunday by Sunday to the gray old church. Matins and Vespers, and the tranquil rite, The surpliced priest, low prayer, and soaring chant Worked on him, and the cheerful Sunday sports, The dance, the race, the swift unerring shaft, When hymns and prayers were done; and so he lived A blameless, unawakened life. Till last, One fateful Sabbath morning, as he sate Within the village church, the preacher's voice, Bidding them keep the holy day of rest, Seemed to the awakened conscience of the youth To probe his inner soul. The merry throng Crowded the green when the reproving voice Was still, and with them he. But as his arm Was raised to strike the ball, again the voice Loud on his inner ear, and in the skies A pitying Heavenly face, and all his strength Sank nerveless sudden as by that strange chill Which strikes the paralytic, and he knew Some vague awakened consciousness of guilt And terror; but as yet no healing power Possessed his restless soul, only despair And wretchlessness, and such ungoverned speech That, hearing him, some hapless wanton once Reproved him for his fault. Then with sad heart He strove to mend. He set a ceaseless watch Upon his careless tongue, the sports he loved He shunned as sin, all innocent delights He dared no more enjoy; the game, the dance, Music at last, and song, with iron will He put from him, and in the mellow chimes Of pealing bells and the tumultuous joy Of mixed reverberant sound bore part no more, Standing without, beneath the reeling tower, An outcast in the darkness, grown at last Afraid lest haply the impending walls, As in Siloam erst, avenged his sin. Thus did he strive long time with his own soul, A doubter self-accused, till one fair day, Working in summer, in the silent streets Of Bedford, at his task, he chanced to hear Three humble women, sitting in the sun, Discourse of things Divine; and all his heart Was kindled into faith in the New Birth They spake of, and again and yet again, Day after day, he sought them; for his soul Cared but for Heaven alone. And then again, Like his own Pilgrim, who had travelled far From the sad City on the road to Heaven, Yet passed to Doubting Castle, he would make A trial of his faith, still sore afraid Lest he had none, bidding the little pools Of water dry because the Word had said That whoso should believe, even as a grain Of mustard-seed, might work all miracles; And when he dared not put it to the touch Fresh doubts assailed his soul. Was he elect Among the saints of God? The day of Grace, Was it not past for him? Was there yet room For such as he? Ah, nay; too late! too late! The ranks of the elect were full, the tale Accomplished, and for him the Pit of Hell, Naught else, for all his prayers. ‚ÄòGo sin; thy fate Is sealed, thou canst not change it,‚Äô pealed the voice Of Evil. But the undying voice within Answered, ‚ÄòI will not.‚Äô And amid the gloom Of utter hopelessness he kept his feet From straying, though each trivial act or word He feared might turn to ill. Terror of death Pressed sore on him, lest he should die in sin, And yet he feared to live, lest haply use Might dull that healing pain. The lowest brute, Nay, the poor reptile on his path, he deemed Happier than he; or if at times he held Some hope of Heaven, the Tempter came and bade him, In visions in the watches of the night, Renounce the Hand which saved him. ‚ÄòSell him,‚Äô cried The Tempter's voice within him, ruthlessly Sounding through every trivial act and thought, Sleeping or waking; till it came to seem, After long struggles and convulsive throes, As if at last his weary, o'erwrought brain Assented to the wrong. And straight the day Grew black as night, the very stones cried out Against his sin. And then, oh joy! there came, Even in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, To this poor pilgrim soul a heavenly Light And Voice of Comfort. All his former sins Of doubt or word or act, he knew forgiven Of a great Love and Grace; and happiness Unmixed with fear, and full assurance, filled That self-tormented soul. Rapt in high joy, When, like S. Francis 'midst his feathered throng, He paced the new-sown fallows whence should spring Life's seed, as for his soul, his jubilant heart Would almost to the cawing rooks proclaim His tale of Love Divine. So that vexed soul Found peace at last, and saw with clearer sight ‚ÄúThe heights of Grace and Love and Mercy.‚Äù Soon Within the lustral waters of the Ouse His life was cleansed, and thenceforth dedicate To preach the Word he loved, his eloquent speech, Not tongue-tied by the learning of the schools, Speaking to sinners. As one from the dead, As one who bore a fire, oppressed by guilt And terror, came he, whom nor guilt nor hell Could silence, but 'neath humble roofs and low, On village greens, beneath the twilight heavens, Always he preached the Word. The liturgies Dear to the saintly Herbert drew him not, For whom each prayer rose new-born from the heart To clothe itself in words, and so he spake With full assurance, soul to soul, and led, In part despite his creed, men's careless lives To good and was content. Ay, though the fire Of fierce sectarian passion and loud strifes Swept the enfranchised land, and slander's tooth Assailed his peace, yet worked he for his Lord And was content. But on those halcyon days Broke the intolerant law. The warning came That he, on pain of weary prisoned years, And exile, and the bondsman's death in life, Should preach the Word no more. He took no heed, But when they closed his place of praise and prayer, In sheds or barns, or 'mid the shadowy woods, He spake to kindling souls. Last, when the law Forbade the freedom more, he scorned to obey, Since if it were a sin to meet, and draw All men to follow Christ, then sin he would. Therefore to prison haled they him, away From his loved home. His dear and ailing wife He left; his helpless children four he left; And one, his little daughter blind from birth, Whom more than life he loved, to the hard world And penury and suffering years he left, To do God's will; though all his father's heart Yearned to them, knowing all the bitter pains, Cold, hunger, nakedness, which should await The lives his faith made orphan. Yet his soul Was steadfast. ‚ÄòI must do His will, I must, And venture all for Him.‚Äô And so his feet, Pacing this weary wilderness, at length Came on a certain place where was a Den, And there he laid him down for twelve long years, And dreamt his deathless dream. Dear prison cell Above all others blest! where self-immured, Because he might not purchase liberty With silence from good words, that suffering soul Languished long years; no cloistered convent pure Borerarer fruit than thine, nor hermitage Beneath the desert stars. There lives no race Of Christian men but dreams thy dream, nor creed But holds it dear, because its clear voice calls Deep in the sacred silence of the soul! For here it was that Christian rose and fled The City of Destruction, and alone Toiled on the rugged, narrow way, to where The wicket gate was set, and a fair light To guide to it. Here fell his feet awhile Into the Slough of Despond. Here he found The House of the Interpreter, and climbed The Hill of Difficulty, and reposed Within the Palace Beautiful, and slept In Peace, and from the ramparts with the dawn Looked down upon Emmanuel's land, a fair And smiling country, rich with flowers and fruits And water-springs, and on the further heaven Flushed with the rising Sun, the untrodden snows Of the Delectable, Eternal Hills, Hard by the City of God. And here he took His armour, and went fearless down to fight Apollyon, and prevailed, and saw beneath, Stretched in thick darkness, filled with dreadful sounds, The Valley of the Shadow of Death, and dared To thread the darkling pass, where piteous wails, And rising fiery smoke, and dead men's bones, And dreadfuller, the onward rushing flight Of Fiends unseen, the spectral shades of Doubt, Assailed his steadfast soul. And here he saw Vanity Fair, the sad world's counterfeit, Wherefrom the martyred Pilgrim passed to Heaven. And here the dungeon glooms of Doubting yawned, The stronghold of Despair, which held him fast Whose lips had tasted of the River of Life. Here smiled the plains of Beulah, and beyond Stole the dark deep which all mankind must cross, Sinner and saint; and here the golden domes Of the Celestial City beamed on him Who after Life's sad pilgrimage was blest! But when to his dear home he came again, After twelve years of prison, free to preach His message as he would, he knew what change Time brings to all; dead was his sightless girl, And bare his humble home. So with brave heart He set himself to work, but chiefly vowed His toil to Heaven. To labour for his Church Was all his joy, and yet his worldly store Increased, and he in great respect of men, With his good wife, among his stalwart boys, Flourished long busy years; and all the doubt And misery of old were gone, and clear The sunset of the evening of his days Shone on him, tranquil gold. Through all the strife Of those dark troubled times, he lived unmoved A peaceful life, scorning the narrow bonds Dear to the zealot, broad in tolerance For every Christian creed or rite or name Which loved the Spirit of God; and toiled for souls In his dear native town, and was content. Then while as yet his green, unbroken age Was vigorous, came the end which comes at last To all things living. One there was whose wrath Burned fierce against his son, and he who knew The blessing of the Peacemakers was fain To reconcile the pair. And as he rode Loving his task, upon the wintry way A sudden rain-storm chilled his weary frame, And fever racked his limbs. Ten suffering days He lingered far from home, and with the cry, ‚ÄòTake me‚Äîto Thee I come,‚Äô breathed out his life.‚Äù Which things when I had heard, my kindling soul Burst into words: ‚ÄúOh, precious gift and rare Of Heaven, which from the slough of common life, And stony wastes of penury, despite, Oppression, want, despondency, canst raise The perfumed rose of Fancy, and the pure White lily of the Saint! Ah, not alone In cloistered convents cold, or storied shrines, Springs up the saintly life, nor in the Halls Of Learning blooms the perfect flower of thought! Myriads of faltering feet have trod the road Thou troddest once, and fought and fallen, or come Through thee to victory, and as they pass, Fired with a broader faith and wider hope Than that thou knewest; on their painful way, Not wholly thine, but to the self-same goal, Still solaced by thy precious allegory, Take thee and thy quaint Dream for staff and guide, Throughout the perilous pilgrimage to Heaven.‚Äù Then came another, of priestly garb and mien, A young man still, wanting the years of Christ, But long since with the saints. Not as the priest Of Sarum, or that peasant pilgrim, he. A poet with the contemplative gaze And listening ear, but quick of force and eye, Who fought the wrong without, the wrong within, And, being a pure saint, like those of old, Abased himself and all the precious gifts God gave him, flinging all before the feet Of Him whose name he bore‚Äîa fragile form Upon whose hectic cheek there burned a flush That was not health; who lived as Xavier lived, And died like him upon the burning sands, Untended, yet whose creed was far from his As pole from pole; whom grateful England still Loves, though his face I knew not. And my guide, Breathing his name, spake thus: ‚ÄúIn Truro town, Hard by the wave-worn headlands of the West, When now the eighteenth century of the Faith Drew near its end, its martyr that should be Was Henry Martyn born. His father's arm Long in the dark abysses of the mine Slaved for his children's bread. The little son, A weakly boy and studious, sate apart, Shunning the school's rude games, too oft the sport Of coarser wills and stronger, till he found A stout young arm, upon whose ready aid He rested and was happy; and his keen And vivid brain grew stronger, and his thirst For knowledge, till at length, a boy in age, To Granta's venerable halls he went, A student not obscure, and with hard toil Laboured four happy years of blameless youth, And took at last the foremost place, and rose To fame and honour of men, and reaped the high Reward of studious hours, the untroubled life Spent in the contemplative courts where comes No murmur of the world, but only thought And knowledge draw the thinker, till sometimes The careless soul, missing the wholesome stir Of daily care, grows slothful, the quick brain Sinks low in indolent ease and base content, And bears no worthy fruit. But not for him These perils were, because a higher thirst‚Äî Higher than wealth, or ease, or honour of men, Or learning's self‚Äîpossessed his yearning soul; When the same friend who helped his friendless youth, Now to a full and finer manhood grown, Bade him do all things not for fame of men, But for God's glory. And his sister's voice Thrilled through him with the pure ascetic glow Of simple fervour. Not at first his soul Gave heed, impatient with those warning words, And fired with youthful pride and hot pursuit Of flying knowledge; but at length the spark Kindled within him, and the sudden loss Of the dear father of his love laid bare The chambers of his soul, and filled his heart With other thoughts than earth's, till, when he gained The meed of all his hopes, which opened to him The path of earthly honour, the youth's soul Knew, with a sick surprise, his empty hand Grasped but a shadow. Then the awakened gaze, Turned wholly from the earth; on things of Heaven He dwelt both day and night. The thought of God Filled him with infinite joy; his craving soul Dwelt on Him as a feast, as did the soul Of rapt Francesco in his holy cell In blest Assisi; and he knew the pain, The deep despondence of the saint, the doubt, The consciousness of dark offence, the joy Of full assurance last, when Heaven itself Stands open to the ecstasy of faith. Therefore, though all men smiled on him, though smooth Life's path lay stretched before him‚Äîwealth and fame, The dignity of learning, the high meed Which crowns the pleader's skill, the Senate itself, Waiting his keen young brain‚Äîhe turned from all To that untried, laborious way which lay Across wide seas, to spend a lonely life Spreading the light he loved, beneath the glare Of tropic skies, by desert sands and wilds Far from all Christian converse, and the gain Of our long eighteen centuries, and pine Alone 'mid millions, knowing not his Lord; The Brahmins' fables, the relentless lie Of Islam‚Äîthese he chose to bear, who knew How swift the night should fall on him, and burned To save one soul alive while yet 'twas day. This filled his thoughts, this only, and for this On the pure altar of his soul he heaped A costlier sacrifice, this youth in years, For whom Love called, and loving hands, and hope Of childish lives around him, offering these, Like all the rest, to God. Yet when his hour Was come to leave his England, was it strange His weakling life pined for the parting kiss Of love and kindred, whom his prescient soul Knew he should see no more, and, week by week Tossed on the wandering wave, driven back once more By battling winds, looked with deep longing eyes On the dear shore? Yet never did he pray The cup might pass from him, not when the curse Of war assailed his gentle eyes and wrung His soul with agony. A priest, he filled All priestly duty, though his shuddering soul Shrank from the sight of blood. Through storm and stress And perils of the sea, through all despite Of scoffing men, who lent no willing ear To his high message, still the humble saint Was instant in his work, and bore the jeers And unbelief around him, he who left His place of honour for the Faith, and did His uncomplaining service. Thus at last He reached the Indian shore, where he would spend His life in saintly labours till the end. There ten long years he toiled on, day by day, Writing his patient record of a soul Which struggles for the Right. The home of friends Who cared for him and Heaven, and would have kept him, Impatient for his work, he left behind, And straight, across the burning plains, alone, Sped, cheerful, where no ray of Christ had risen To break the age-long gloom; there, solitary, Unfriended, solaced by no answering soul, With little blessing on his work, or fruit Of his great toil, reproaching every hour He lost for God, knowing how short his span, And how immense his task, now preaching oft To careless ears, now spending his keen brain As when he wrought for fame and honour of men, With Munshi and with Pundit, if his skill Might give to each, in his own tongue, the Word, He spent his youth. Last, when his task of love Was done, and seven long years of ceaseless toil Had worked their will on him, there came fresh griefs To try his faith. The woman of his love Feared to leave all and give her life to his, And both to God; his sisters passed away To Heaven, nor saw him more. There seemed on earth Nothing for which to live, except the Faith; The last of all his race, unloved, alone‚Äî Only the Faith, the Faith! until his soul Wore thin her prison bars, and he was fain To rest awhile, or work no more the work For which alone he lived. Then over seas Once more he took his way, leaving the land Where he had hoped to die, along the roll Of the warm tropic wave. Once more he saw Ceylon's green palm-fringed shore, the sumptuous tomb Of him, his brother of old, who strove like him To spread the Faith, and, like him, died for it, S. Francis Xavier, and among the caves Of storied Elephanta stayed; but soon, His great zeal firing him, took ship again, And, after weary wanderings, gained at last The Persian wastes, and dared the difficult track To Shiraz through the desert. Day by day The fierce sun blazed upon the sands; by night The dead air, like a furnace blast, assailed His fevered frame, and parched him and consumed him With horrible thirst, and robbed his eyes of sleep Till life was well-nigh spent. And then the hand Which seemed to guide him always led his feet To a sweet vale, England in sight and sound, Hidden in the dreadful waste, where cool airs blew, Streams ran, and birds sang clear, and wheat was gold. Then all his faithful heart burst forth in praise, As did the Kingly Bard's: ‚ÄòHe maketh us To lie down in green pastures, and beside The clear cool waters leadeth.‚Äô Thus his soul Made laud, and was content, praising the Lord, In Shiraz. There one happy toilsome year He sojourned. Day by day the sages came Who held the faith of Islam, and would hear Of Him whose Name he taught. Through the long days He laboured at his work, spending the gifts God lent him, for the Faith. Last, when at length The Gospel spake to Persian ears, he bore His work to Tabriz, where he sought the King, Faring by night along the moonlit vales, Through bowery lanes, where the loud nightingales Thrilled the white fields with song. Then feverish heats Burned him upon his way, and sapped his strength; And when, weak unto death, he reached the place Where the King sojourned late, he found him not, Only his courtiers' scorn. Then his great heart Broke in impatient words. ‚ÄòMy God,‚Äô he cried, ‚ÄòWhat fault is mine that men should mock me thus, Save only love for Thee?‚Äô And when he turned Despairing homeward, soon again he pined Prostrate in pain, the fever seizing him Two weary months, and his brain burned like fire, A present death in life. Yet not the less His faithful soul bare witness to the Faith. Rejection, sickness, torment‚Äîwhat are these To the believer's thought! And when he rose, Musing upon the enormous waste which lay 'Twixt him and home, whither, his brave work done, His longing eyes were turned, his weary heart Fainted within him, and he looked no more To press the hands he loved. Hopeless he fared On his last journey. 'Neath the fabled peak Of Ararat he stayed awhile, to rest In the hushed convent with the Armenian monks, A cheerful guest. And then again the grip Of fever clutched him, and depressed his soul With sad forebodings. Yet he struggled still Towards Stamboul, though the plague slew day by day Its thousands, and the affrighted tribes around Fled the advancing Death. ‚ÄòThy will be done; Living or dying, oh, remember me!‚Äô Thus writes the dying saint. And then long days Of misery, which his languid hand records, When now a fire consumed him, now the cold Of palsy left him ice. Laid on the ground, His soul was filled with God, his Company, His Friend, his Comforter. ‚ÄòOh, when shall Time Be done, and that new Heaven and Earth appear Where dwelleth Righteousness?‚Äô Thus his hand traced Its last pure words. Then but a few brief hours, And he unfriended, far from help and home, Alone, but having Christ, with no kind hand To close the eyes which saw the joys unseen And vision of the blest; worn out, in pain‚Äî Whether of fever or the deadly force Of pestilence, none knoweth‚Äîbreathed his last, And bore the martyr's palm.‚Äù And then once more I seemed to hear a voice,‚Äîwas it my guide, Or my own soul?‚Äîdiscourse: ‚ÄúShall any ask, Was all thy suffering naught, because the strength Of Error still bears sway? Ah! too brief life, So jealous of each hour, and counting lost Each day not vowed to Heaven. What, hadst thou known Thy labour thus in vain? Fourscore long years Have passed since thou, like kindred souls to-day, Diedst for the Truth; the long, slow, barren years Mock us and all our toil. Hadst thou done well To reap a little while thy well-earned meed Of Thought in lettered ease? Hadst thou done well To give thee to the pleader's art, and strive To make the Wrong seem Right, and sink at last To wealth and praise of men, seeking, a judge Scorning the graceless sophistries of old, To cure thy former ill‚Äîthou whose keen brain Had doubtless borne thee far? Hadst thou done well To doze slow hours, sunk deep in mitred ease, Soothed by sweet chants, lost in the vaporous grey; Or, a great preacher, mark the moistened eyes, Flushed cheeks, and quick-drawn breaths thy facile tongue Had stirred, thyself unmoved; or shine a light Of the Senate, till thy peers in high debate Bowed to thy eloquent speech, and thou shouldst guide The helm of our great England? Was it well To hold this strange Twin-Nature of our Race, Which soars so high and sinks so low, as thou, Unutterably vile in thought, in will, In every action vile, trampling thy soul In dust before thy God, who made thee too, And all things, and has left us free to take The path we would, to Heaven or hell, and knows His work not wholly base, nor framed too fine For this our place of trial? Nay, I know How many ways of safety He displays To the awakened soul the way thou trodd'st, The way of San Francesco's bless√®d cell, The honourable trivial road which leads By silent saintly liturgies of home Up to the selfsame Heaven. But this I know Is certain, that thy lifelong sacrifice Was best for thee, and best the voice which called From love and friendship, ay, from all good things Which make life happy, to the burning plains Where thou shouldst spend thy few and evil days Of toil and suffering, pouring forth thy life Like water for the Faith, shedding thy blood As did of old the Martyrs, drop by drop, Upon the ungrateful sand of heathen hearts.‚Äù And then I saw a stately figure come, Which seemed to wear the quaint and dovelike robe Of silver-grey, the lawn that hid the hair, The modest decent garb they love who vow Their lives to heaven, and though no convent bars Withdraw them from the world, around them build A nunnery, and, 'mid the noise and din Of all the sensual and wrongful world, An oratory where the Spirit may dwell And, long-awaited, claim its own; the band Who struck the fetters from the slave, who tend The halt and sick, and spend themselves in works Of mercy for the prisoners who lie bound In chains their sins have forged; and straight my eyes Knew whom it was they saw, before my guide, With grave voice softening as it went, replied To my unspoken thought. ‚ÄúA hundred years Have passed since she thou seest, on the earth Came first, of gentle birth and wealth and ease, Where the grey Anglian city in the east Broods round its central spire. A blooming girl, In her first youth she trod with eager feet The path of innocent pleasure; none more gay At chase or festal than the lithe young form Who in her scarlet habit loved to fly Across the rushing fields, or listen rapt To stirring martial melodies, or tread The giddy measures of the dance, and take, With her young motherless sisters, what delight Beseemed their youth. Then, in her budding age, When only seventeen summers smiled on her, The joys she scarce had known began to pall, And she reproached herself with every thought Which stole her hours from Heaven. Blind dreams of good, Yearnings for something higher than she knew, Took her, and, knowing this perplex√®d world Moves towards the best, the felt her drifting life A hapless bark which fronts the gathering storm Without a pilot's skill. But the great Hand Was with her not the less, though yet unseen, And soon the pleading of a kindred soul Sent over seas, woke in her inmost depths Assurance mixt with tears, and presently The dull world faded from her, and she gave Her all to Heaven. Then all her costly robes She left, and took the habit of a Friend And their plain speech‚Äîslowly, and half ashamed, Lest those who knew her scoffed; but not the less She was convinced, and held the Faith to the end. Thence through her long sweet life, her own hand writes Her daily story. Through what deeps of doubt And self-distrust, high yearnings, often dashed By that o'erwhelming sense of grave offence Which takes the saints alone, and oftentimes What high and glorious certitudes of faith, The heavens standing open, and the Lord Beckoning with gracious hand, they know who read The story of her days. Love came to her, And happy wedlock, and unclouded years, And fair-grown offspring. All good gifts of earth, ‚ÄòAs honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,‚Äô A heart which turned to Heaven and dwelt with God‚Äî All these were hers. Ofttimes she spake the Word, Spurning the conscious weakness of her sex And her own shrinking modesty; ofttimes She nursed the sick, and did relieve with alms The needy, works of mercy and of faith Filling her life. And yet, not allcontent With such high duty, still her yearning soul, Which not the weight of daily household care, Nor love of spouse or children, satisfied, Panted for more, and hastened to the work Which keeps her memory green, and crowns her Saint, And raised her to the skies. 'Twas in the foul And crowded prison wards her pitying heart Found its fit task. Three hundred hapless souls Huddled together, starving, naked, vile‚Äî The innocent and guilty, the poor wretch Who stepped a foot-pace from the path of good, Mewed side by side within that narrow jail With those who had put off, for desperate years, The last thin rags of shame; a dreadful band, Brutal, unclean, without a bed to rest Their miserable limbs, save the damp floor Of the foul, reeking dungeon. Frenzied cries Of rank offence, blaspheming God and man, Worse than of madness, smote the shrinking ear; And 'mid the hideous throng, more piteous still, The teeming ranks of children, the shrill note Of childish voices trained in all the lore Of wickedness, to beg, to sot, to steal, To curse. Each sight and sound that had made Hell More dreadful than before, the sight of lives Which had been innocent once, now doomed and damned, Forlorn of men, and quite forgot by God! Nay, not forgotten! Since one human heart Felt pity for them still. The faithful soul Of that good nursing-mother blazed afire, Hearing and seeing, and her inmost depths Were kindled into flame. But not at once Might she begin her life-work. Birth and Death, Young lives that came and went, the loss of friends And brethren, that strange hush and chill which comes To every home when first the young flock dares To spread weak wings and tempt the perilous air Beyond the nest‚Äîthese held her three long years Far from the work she loved. And then at last She found her footsteps free, and took her way To the grim prison where that hapless crowd Rotted in sin. Alone, with none to aid, Like the old seer among the ravening jaws, Or that diviner Figure which beamed hope To the poor prisoned spirits waiting long, The Beatific End, she passed and brought The light of fuller Day, with mild eyes filled With gentle pity for their sin, with voice So clear, so soft, so musical, the tongue As of an angel. 'Mid the noise, the din Of blasphemy, and rank offence, she spake And hushed all other sound, except the noise Of weeping from repentant hearts, and told How, even at the eleventh hour, the Lord Was strong to save, telling of Him she served, Whose name they knew not yet; and on the depths Of those poor rayless souls, sunk deep in ill, Shone with some pure reflected light of Heaven, And touched‚Äîa mother herself‚Äîthe mothers' hearts With pity for the children who should come Like them to ruin, till the spark Divine, Which never dies out quite, shone out once more, And once again, from out the sloughs of sin, Uprose toward Heaven some faint fair flower of good. Thus she, and with her a devoted band Of women, strove for God. With instant prayer She pleaded with them; clothing, shelter, food She gained for them, and tidings of the Word. And for those hapless childish lives she found Fit teaching; those poor souls the pitiless law Doomed to the felon's end, she fortified, As did of old S. Catharine, with her prayers Even at the gate of Death. Nor could her pity Stay here, nor bear the intolerable load Of the uncaring law which played with life As might a tiger, stern, exacting blood For every trivial ill. With those vile powers Unfaith and selfishness, which ruled the world And mar it yet and will, she strove with might, And did at last prevail; and ere she died, No more the shameless wickedness was done Which from all time and shed the innocent blood In the pure name of Law, staking a life Against each venial wrong. Oh, clear-eyed soul, That saw the Right undimmed, above the mists That blinded worldly eyes, because it knew The rule of Right, one with the Law of God! But not alone her works of mercy touched The prisoner in his cell. When to their doom Of slavery, worse than death, the senseless law Had sent those hapless souls, over wide seas, To the far underworld, it prisoned them Mixed as of yore, the felon old in sin, The almost innocent, and the young lives Of children thrust together, month on month Festering between the crowded decks, till came The day when they were flung upon the shore Of a new land, helpless, unclothed, unfed, Tainted by forced companionship with ill, To die of want or only live by sin. These wrongs her prescient eye foresaw and gave Her thought to mend. Young sinners new to wrong She from the guiltier set apart, and all, When the new world loomed on their wondering gaze, Found hands of welcome. Oft, in some frail skiff Daring the wintry Thames, ere the sad ship Sailed with its load, her soft imploring voice Rose high for all, commending them to Heaven, And pleading with such gentle words and pure, Their hard hearts melted, and the flowing tears Relieved their pain; and on the deck around The rude rough seamen heard, without a word, The saint's high message and the sweet clear tones, And grew ashamed to scoff; while as she knelt The helpless women checked their gathering grief, In silence till the dark boat on the stream Was lost in night, and took their only friend. Thus throughout all the land, year after year, She cleansed each teeming prison. The chill North She traversed, and the melancholy West, And by the perilous seas which welter round The still-vexed Channel Isles, thence to fair France, Still seeking what of help she could for those Whom their sin prisoned fast, and the low plains Of deep-sunk Holland. Where her footsteps turned She left a blessing. From the Russian snows Came news of those her high example drew To kindred deeds of mercy. Courts and Thrones Paid fitting honour to her work, and she, Amid the felons now, now set on high With Queens to do her honour, kept unchanged Her humble heart, breathing the self same prayer: ‚ÄòBy any ways, by any paths Thou wilt, So men may come to knowledge of Thy Truth.‚Äô But not the less the changing, chanceful world Pressed on her, than on those blest souls of old. The wealth she only prized because it gave Power to do good; which gathers day by day To crush the miser with its load, from her Was taken for no fault; her stately home She left a blameless exile. Time and Death Knocked loudly at her doors. The saintly band, Brothers and sisters, thinned; the loving eyes Of children closed untimely; the young lives Of children's children went, leaving her age To mourn them. Fever coming swept the home Of her dear son, and took him, the strong stay Of his young flock. Who reads her story knows A gathering tale of loss, to which each year Brought its own added sum. Her natural force, Before the allotted span, grew faint and wan, And, spent with pain, month after month she lay In suffering, till she prayed, if 'twere God's will, That she might be at rest; and sometimes, weak And sore beset, her saintly humbleness Was dashed with self-distrust, and she who felt The Everlasting Arms beneath her, knew The natural fear which ofttimes vexes less The sinner than the saint. So when her hour Was come, her children round her, she prepared To meet the Lord she loved. She whose long life Was lived for Him; whose earliest waking thought Was every morn for Him; whose gathering years Were crowned with deeds of mercy; whose dear name, In every clime, thousands of rescued souls Uttered with tremulous lips and full of praise; Whose thought was always how to raise to hope The poor, the sick, the fallen; how to strike The fetters from the prisoner and the slave; And save the piteous childish lives the State Had left to certain ruin‚Äîshe no less Knew the Divine despondency which marks The saintly soul. ‚ÄòPray for me,‚Äô said her voice; ‚ÄòIt is a strife, but I am safe.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúDear saint, Ay, thou wert safe,‚Äù I cried, ‚Äúbecause thy heart Was humble! To what heights of purity, What inaccessible awful precipices Of duty, didst thou turn thy gaze whose soul Knew this diviner failure? To what depths Of inner heaven, to what perfectness Of Him thy Great Exemplar, didst thou strain? Not only in the cloister the rapt soul Dwells with Him, or beneath the midnight stars Mingles with Him and bears the sacred wounds Of the Passion, but along the well-trod road Of daily trivial life the race is run To where the crown awaits them, and the palm. Who loves the Right, loves Him who taught it too; And whoso loves his brother, loves his Lord.‚Äù And then there came, last risen to the skies, The newest of the saints I marked, who went Only one brief year since, to bear the palm And wear the crown, a priest whose comely youth, Dark kindly eyes, and broad and thoughtful brow Showed still to haunting fancy marks of care, Sobering its new-found joy. The gentle gaze Lighted the gracious face, no longer scarred By fell disease, that was his cross, his crown; And with a double tenderness my guide Made answer softly to my silent quest. ‚ÄúFrom the long wave of the Pacific Sea Rise the enchanted islands of the West. There the green surge, translucent, flowered with foam, Flings its warm snows to kiss the stooping palm; But from the deep's soft bosom rose no sound Of rippling mirth, nor more the fair brown forms, Half heathen, naked, joyous, crowned with flowers, Rode high as erst on the caressing wave, Because some strange immedicable hurt Consumed them, and they pined in hopeless pain, Despairing, till a servant of the Lord Was sent to them with succour for their need, And cleansed the desperate souls, which, struck by doom, Cursing their fate, turned them to reckless ill; And gave his life to serve them, till he died, A leper in their midst. At Tremeloo, Upon the far-off Belgian plain, was born He whom the admiring tongues of half the world Call Damien. All the story of his days Is full of pureness. A strange child, engrossed In musing thought, he with the shepherds loved To drive afield ere yet the opening morn, Loosed from its flood-gates in the illumined east, O'erflowed the slumbering plains. There all day long, A lamb amid the innocent lambs, in play He whiled away the hours, till all his kin And kindly neighbours knew his childish name, ‚ÄòThe Little Shepherd;‚Äô and the lessons learnt From solitary musings, with the broad Still plain around, and the unbounded vault Of Heaven above him, and no sound of life Save bleating flocks and humming bees and songs Of mounting larks, inspired his brooding thought With visions not of earth, and framed his lips To an unspoken praise; and when he heard The ‚ÄòAngelus‚Äô thrill o'er the twilight fields, His childish soul rejoiced, and his young knees Were bent in prayer, till all the country side Cherished the strange grave child. And once, men tell, At Whitsuntide, the holy feast, there was A neighbouring fair of simple revelry, And since the dawn none saw him. When they searched The crowded village streets, they found no trace Of the young truant; but his grandsire went, Knowing his faith, to seek him, and, indeed, He was not 'mid the careless peasant throng, Nor jovial haunts of rustic merriment, But in the church; for in the darkling aisles They found the young child kneeling, rapt, alone, Breathing some simple prayer. For all his soul Was full of the Unseen, and all his heart Turned heavenward as the sunflower to the sun. But when his childish days were past, and now Youth blossomed in him, youth with dim grave thoughts And scarce confessed designs, he would not take Thought of the priestly office yet, but spent His throbbing, eager life in wholesome cares Fit for his budding age. Yet was his soul Maiden and pure, and all who knew the boy Praised his white life. Till one day, when his years Touched close on manhood, in a church he knelt, Where some strong Preacher, fired with faith in good, Spake burning words; and straight his ardent heart Kindled, and all night long he knelt and prayed For guidance, and Heaven came to him and rapt That yearning soul, so that he would no more Do his own work, but God's. And so he took The priestly office, and there came command‚Äî The priest, his brother, lying like to die‚Äî He in his stead should bear the lamp of Faith To the far isles of the Pacific Sea, Across the world, alone. And when he heard, His glad heart leapt within him, for he knew That thus he best should do God's will and work His work upon the earth. After long months Of storm-tost days and perilous, with the spring, Upon the day of his good patron saint, S. Joseph, to his fated shore he came, Hawaii, where he laboured year by year In happiness, doing his Master's work With ceaseless toil. Once on a mountain side He paused, knowing that somewhere nigh lay hid A Christian village, where the hungry souls Waited their coming priest. When, with great stress Of hand and foot, on the precipitous steep Climbing, he gained the summit, lo! beneath A cavernous chasm yawned; but nowhere saw he Traces of men. Yet, without thought of doubt, He, by new difficult crags ascending, spied Another loftier hill, and climbed again And reached the summit; but again no trace Of men or dwellings, but a lonely plain, And then again a hill; and so at last, After long toil, spent, bleeding hand and foot, Calling to mind the sufferings on the Tree, And that for those poor souls his Master died, Tottering he found his people, and confirmed Their faith, and was rewarded for his pain. But while his long laborious days he spent In service of his Lord, his pitying eyes Took many a sight of grievous misery Which naught might heal. For on those happy isles, Where sea and sky wear a perpetual smile, And all the lavish earth with flower and fruit Laughs always, and from out the odorous gloom Of blossomed trees a myriad creepers hang Laden with perfume, and the feathery fronds Of giant ferns spring upward twice the height Of a man's stature, and bright birds flash by On jewelled wings, a thousand brilliant hues, Flower-like, among the flowers, and the clear sea Holds in its azure deeps a thousand lights Of sapphire scales, or gold, or glowing red, Or tints which match the rainbow's all in one, Brighter than any which the cunning skill Of painter limns; and, 'midst the tropic wealth Of lustrous blossoms strange to Northern eyes, Sweet roses blush, and lilies sprent with gold Droop their fair heads, and starry myrtles wake Memories of classic grace;‚Äîamidst all these And the poor joyous lives which, crowned with flowers, Like the old careless gods of Pagan eld, Let the hours pass, and were content, nor knew Our Northern cares, nor thought of Hell or Heaven, Naught but delight; there came long years ago, Brought from the teeming East, a dreadful ill, Which naught might cure, and seized those hapless limbs, And rotted them away, mere death in life, Maimed horribly, and losing human form And semblance, till at last the wretched spirit Released itself and fled. And since the touch Of hand or robe was thought to take with it The dread contagion, from the land they chased Those hopeless sufferers, to where there rose Sheer from the Southern Sea the frowning cliffs Of Molokai. On its northern edge The island blossoms into purple peaks, With soaring heads veiled in a fleece of white. There down each steep precipitous gorge the gleam Of leaping waters issuing from the clouds Lights the dark cliffs, and, where a sunbeam strikes, Sparkles in rainbow mists; while at the foot Of those great walls, just raised above the surge, Stretches an emerald plain, white with the homes Of lepers, none beside. Thither, when now The unerring symptoms of that dreadful ill Had shown in them, the lifelong exiles sailed, Bidding a last farewell to home and kin, And love and life, till the slow-working plague Consumed their limbs away. No hope was theirs, Nor fear of God or man; only their doom, Fixed on them undeserving, filled their souls With horror and despair, and careless hate Of Heaven, and utter recklessness of ill, Since doomed they were, and an unchecked desire To enjoy, since die they must. And so it came That those poor lives, pining in misery, Blasphemed their fate and lived in present hell. Yet, since no more they might return, nor those Who tended them, long time they pined with none To care for them, till one day, when the ship Sailed with its fatal load, and the saint took His last farewells with tears, the fire of Faith Flamed up within his heart. Without a word To friends, or care for clothing or for food, Of a sudden Damien leapt on board, and went Joyful to meet his doom of pain and death, Like the brave saints of old; and for our age, Our weakling age, sick of a deadly doubt, Renewed the primal ecstasy of Faith! There, sixteen years 'mid those forsaken folk, He laboured. Long, beneath no sheltering roof But open to the winds and rains of heaven He slept, when sleep he might; for all his hours Were spent to bring to God the perishing souls Their great despair corrupted. Every-where His cheerful smile and faithful words allured The lives his hands relieved, and every-where The people, struggling back to love and right, Left the old vices of despair, the drink That brought oblivion, and the sensual depths Wherein they wallowed late, devoid of hope, Forlorn of God; and day by day the sound Of prayer and praise arose where blasphemies Had rent the shuddering air. And since the power Of lustral waters oftentimes works out A miracle upon the tainted soul As on the body, and what cleanses this Makes pure the other; from a clear cold pool High on the mountain, fed by rain and cloud, He led the full stream's salutary flow To every hut where desperate suffering pined; And straight those wretched lairs grew clean, the plague Lightened, and with it pain, and their lips blessed The saint who succoured them, and, through him, God, And sinned no more, and hope reviving wrought Its precious spell, and happy flower-set homes Rose where the lepers huddled ere he came, Rotting in misery, and the pious care Of brethren far away, learning his need, Sent food and money for his aid, and all Was of his hand. And eager helpers came, Nor of his Church alone, though of his Lord‚Äî Brothers and sisters brave, who work to-day His bless√®d work, though he is dead and gone. Likewise he built a hospice, where the sick Were gently tended. There, through every day, He laboured in their midst, spake words of hope, Dressed their sad wounds, brought them what delicate food His means supplied, and when they came to die Paid the last rites, and with his own hands laid The dead in earth; and when the plague had rapt Their hapless parents, 'twas his fostering hand Cared for the orphans, doomed, maybe, to die The same dread death, and pine meanwhile in pain. And as faith's tide rose higher in their souls He, with his own hands, planned and built a shrine For long processions, and the solemn Mass Served upon purest gold. So the swift days Passed, and amid the misery around, As one who bore a charm√®d life, the saint Laboured unscathed for twelve long toilsome years, A father to the orphan, to the sick A kind physician, to the suffering soul A priest in every strait, and, when the end Was come, a reverent hand to close the eyes And smooth the maim√®d limbs, and lay in earth The poor dead clay whose life was hid with God. Thus toiled he full contented years; and then The creeping numbness took him, and he knew, Though with no bodily sign as yet, nor scar, Nor strength diminished, that the common doom Waited him too. He did not quail, nor pine That those beneficent happy years had reached Their sure approaching term‚Äîthe hand of God Was over all, health, sickness, life and death‚Äî ‚ÄòFiat voluntas tua;‚Äô and he toiled With scarce diminished strength, and zeal which knew No shadow of abatement, all his days, A leper like the rest. And when he preached, And when he laboured for the sick, or did His Church's solemn office, all his words Were of ‚Äòus lepers,‚Äô glorying in the load The will of Heaven assigned to him, and proud, Even as his dear Lord touched with healing hand The lepers of old time and made them whole, To be as these he loved in life and death. And when his fading forces sank, there came A band of helpers, priests and brethren true, And ministering women, round his bed; And there among his sick they labour still, With others whom his bright example since Inspired, lives dedicate like his to Heaven And all the struggling suffering Race of men, Working his work of mercy to the end. Lest, when, a year ago, his failing strength Laid him upon his bed, keeping the use Of his great Church, first would the good man make Confession of his sins, and thanksgiving Because the Lord had spared his life so long To do his work. Around his dying bed His people whom he succoured, a great throng Of maim√®d forms, swollen and scarred and bent Out of all human semblance, came and wept, And raised their poor hoarse voices in the hymns He loved, and made a music dearer far To the All-hearing Ear than any strain Which skilful voices soaring to the vaults Of dim cathedrals raise; till when at last, After long weeks of suffering lit with prayer, He gave his spirit back to God, and went To be, at Easter, as he hoped, with Him Who rose before, and the low passing-bell Was heard, there went from that poor leprous throng A solemn wailing, as from those who know That they loved well and now had lost, a friend.‚Äù Even as he ceased my soul within me leapt In praise and thankfulness, and these her words: ‚ÄúAh! bless√®d life which finds its happiness In succouring others, with what store of good‚Äî Good thoughts, good deeds, merciful energies‚Äî Didst thou ascend to Heaven, and take thy rest! I count not all, thy pangs of pain, or sense Of natural loathing overcome by love, Or the short years which brought their certain doom. These, saintly lives lit by the sun of Faith, Despise: but to know failure in thy work, As thou didst oft; the souls which thou didst love Unfaithful, and the hiss of slander mock Thy purpose and thyself; to hear no voice Of praise save that within thee sent from Heaven Or some low faint applause of kindred souls, Far off almost as from a separate star, Whisper across the world, while the base din Of loud detraction smote men's ears; to long For home and feel thy own act banish thee, And know inexorable Nature lurk Behind thee, a deaf Fury pitiless, Wielding a scourge of fire; to ask sometimes In deep depression, as thy Master asked, ‚ÄòHast Thou forsaken me?‚Äô and find no voice To answer thee, nor pity, nor reprieve For all thy sacrifice, nor favouring word‚Äî A martyrdom of years;‚Äîthis were, indeed, Too hard to bear for any but a soul Fired as thine was, nay is, with love immense As Heaven itself, stronger than Life or Death‚Äî The love of God through weak and suffering man, The love of man through his Creator, God.‚Äù But many a saintly form I knew, and passed Without a word, because no vision long Endures, and that for all no mortal life Might well suffice. Did I not mark thy fair Nude youthful grace, Sebastian‚Äîbeautiful As young Apollo on the Olympian hill, Or Marsyas, his victim‚Äîfettered fast And pierced by rankling shafts while thou didst raise Thy patient eyes to Heaven? Saw I not thee, Oh sainted childlike Agnes, with thick locks Of gold, which, grown miraculously long, Guarded thy maiden modesty; or thee, S. Agatha, with thy white wounded breast‚Äî Martyrs and saints? Or thee of recent days, S. Vincent, who thy late-enfranchised years, Freed from the prison bonds thou long hadst borne, Didst spend in works of mercy, and didst care, As might a father, for the childish lives Forlorn which no man heeded? Saw I not Thee, saintly Jeremy, whose daily feet Paced 'neath the long-armed oaks of Golden Grove, Above our winding Towy; or thy mild, Benevolent gaze, good Howard, who didst die, Christ-like, for souls in prison? Saw I not, Blessing our land, thy apostolic form, Dear Wesley, through whose white soul Love Divine Shone unrefracted, whose pure life was full Of love for God and man, whose faithful hand Relit the expiring fire, which sloth and sense And the sad world's unfaith had well-nigh quenched And left in ashes; or thy saintly friend, Fletcher of Madeley, clean consumed of faith And ruth for perishing souls; or thee, whose zeal Laid all thy learning at His feet who gave it, Eliot, apostle to the dying race Of the Red Indian, on their trackless plains Preaching in their own tongue the gracious news Thy learning opened; or thy comely form, Brave Dorothy, who thy abounding life, 'Neath smoke-stained skies, 'mid coarse and brutal souls, Gavest to the maimed and sick, content to be A happy life-long martyr, and didst die Alone at last of hopeless torture-pains Incurable, yet cheerful barest thy cross Even to the end; or ye, oh priceless lives! After long years of terror, day and night, Till death itself seemed better than your dread, Shed for the Faith by many a savage isle Of the Pacific seas; or ye whose graves 'Mid fever-swamps or silent forest depths The Moslem slaver mocks, sent to sure death For Africa. Nay, nay, I marked ye all, But might not tarry more, so vast has grown, Lost in dim eld, and longer, hour by hour, The ever-lengthening pageant of the Blest. And then I marked no other name men know, For now we passed along the close-set files Of saints and martyrs, bearing each the palm, Discerned no more by robes antique, or mien, Or speech, but of the modern centuries, And as we live to-day. So thick they rose Streaming from earth, as when the autumnal year Sheds its fair throng of meteors on the sky. So those pure souls, white with a glittering train Of light, flashed upward, till I might not take Count of their number, for of every race And hue and creed they came, of every age, Both young and old‚Äîall to the heavens above Ascending; and an infinite thankfulness Took me, and joy, because our day, that seems To some so void of faith, so full of pain And chilled with deadly doubt, not less than those The faithful ages might, sent forth its tale Of victories of the Faith, Nor bore they all The name of Christ, but some there were who held The old unchanging Faith from whence He came Whom yet their fathers slew, and some who called On that ascetic Prince who draws the East With some faint law of Mercy and of Love For all created essences, one hope To be with God, even though Man's nature rush To His as doth the river to the sea, Absorbed in Him for ever; and of those To whom the fierce false Prophet calling, taught, Though stained with fanatic zeal and grovelling sense, Amid the noise of base idolatries, The unity of God, the pure, the wise, Who sits to judge the world; there came who left The sensual stye and rose above the din Of the world's wranglings, and who were indeed His saints, though Him they knew not. But of all The most part were of Him, each Christian race Sending its cloud of witnesses to swell The innumerable host. There, came the thralls Of Duty, willing servants old and young, Who love the bonds that bind them, knowing well Their fealty freedom; men who toil enchained Of household care, knowing not rest nor ease, For those they love, and live their briefer lives Unmurmuring; and grave statesmen who toil on To the laborious end, though life sink low, Whom natural rest allures, but strive on still While the sharp tooth of slander gnaws their souls; Or women who have given their ease, their life, To weary cares, nor heed them if they know Their children happy; or who from the hush Of cloistered convents serve with prayer and praise; Or who amid the poor and lowly folk Of all the Churches, as their Master erst, Toil amid sin and pain, and are content To live compassionate days and ask no more Of wages for their service, but consumed Of pity, give their lives to save the lost And hopeless; or who love to minister, Spurning the weakness of their sex, the bloom Of delicate ease, and grace and luxury, And, 'mid the teeming homes of healing, bend To succour bodily ill, while night by night The sick and maimed, in restless slumbers tost, Lie groaning till the dawn, and cries of pain Wring the soft hearts whose duty binds them fast, While the gay festive hearths of friends or home Thrill with sweet music and the rhythmic feet Of careless youth and joyance, and the rose And lily of their gentle girlhood wait Their coming, but in vain, till youth is past, And with it earthly love. All these fair souls In one incessant effluence of light Soared from the earth, the army of the saints Who in all time have set themselves to work The Eternal Will. And yet not all of pain And suffering were they, who thus leaving earth, Rose to high Heaven. To some, high sacrifice Is joy, not pain. For some, from youth to age The even current of their lives flows on, Broken by scarce a ripple, scarce a cloud Veiling the constant blue‚Äîthe daily use Of humble duty, the unchanging round Of homely life; the father's work, who toils Ungrudging day by day, from year to year, To keep the lives he loves, and dies too soon His children round his bed, nor knows at all The tremours of the saint; the lowly tasks Which fill the unchanging round of busy lives, And keep them pure; the willing, cheerful care Of mothers. Wert thou not among the throng, Dear life long fled, who, after tranquil years Unbroken and unclouded by great griefs Or bodily pains, on the sad year's last day Wentest from us; who threescore years and ten Didst wear thy children's love; whose pitying hand Was always open; whose mild voice and eye Drew rich and poor alike, a soul that soared Not on great sacrifice, indeed, or high And saintly pains, but trod life's level plain As 'twere high snows, and daily did inform Earth with some hue of Heaven; on whose loved tomb No word is graven, save thy name and date Of birth and death, because it seemed that none Might fit the gracious life and beautiful, Whose glory was its humbleness, whose work, Built of sweet acts and precious courtesies, The exemplar of a home? Nay, well I know High Heaven were not Heaven, wanting thee And such as thou. Within the gates of God Are many mansions, and each saintly soul Treads its own path, fills its own place, but all Are perfected and blest. And yet how few Of that great congress saw I. He who keeps Lone vigils with the stars notes on night's face Some ghostly, scarce-suspected vapour gleam, And turns his optic-glass to it; and, lo! A mist of suns! wherefrom the sensitive disc Fixes the rays, first scattered, then more dense With longer time, star after hidden star Stealing from out the unimagined void And twinkling into light, till on its face Those dark unplumbed abysses show no speck Of vacant gloom, a white and shining wall Of glomerated worlds, broad as the bound Which feeble fancy, yearning for an end, Builds round the verge of Space. So that bright throng Grew denser as I gazed, till Heaven was full Of the white cloud of witnesses, who still, As always since the worlds and Time began, Stand round the throne of God. Then while I gazed, As in that vision fair which filled the eyes Of the blest seer of Patmos, suddenly The angels with veiled faces cast them down Prostrate, and then a peal of glorious sound, Mightier than any sound of earth, which chased My dream, and well-remembered words I heard: ‚ÄúBlessing and Glory, Wisdom, Thanksgiving, Honour, and Power, and Might be unto Thee For ever and for ever.‚Äù Then methought My soul made answer: ‚ÄúYea, and victory Over Thy Evil. Not Thy saints alone Are Thine, and if one soul were lost to Thee, Thine arm were shortened. All the myriad lives Which are not here, but pine in bitter dole, Do Thou redeem at last, after what toils Thou wilt, in Thine own time, of Thine own will, Purged, if Thou wilt, by age-long lustral pain, Banished for long. Yet through new spheres untried Of Being let them rise, sinner and saint, Higher and higher still, till all shall move In harmony with Thee and Thy great Scheme, Which doth transcend the bounds of Earth and Time; Still let them work Thy work. Yet bring them home; Let none be lost! For see how far Thy Heavens Are higher than our earth, how brief the tale Of little years we live, how low and small Our weak offence, transgression of a child Grown petulant, on whom the father looks With pity, not with wrath. On those dead souls Which unillumined in the outer depths Lie yet, too gross for Heaven, send Thou a beam From Thy great Sun, and, piercing through them, wake The good that slept on earth: and, like the throb Of radiant light which pulses through the mist With which Thy Space is sown, and wakes new worlds, Atom by atom drawn or else repelled; Or as the vibrant subtle note which thrills Upon the sensitive film, and traces on it Figure on figure, curve with curve inlaced Into some perfect flower; so do Thou, Lord, Sound with Thy light and voice the dumb dark depths And, working on the unnumbered souls which lie Far from Thee, shine and call, and, waking in them A latent order, purge them. Make their will Harmonious with the Will which governs all, And orb into some higher form, and start As Thy new worlds to life, till all Thy skies Shine with recovered souls. Then shall it be As those great voices would, and Thou fulfilled Alike in Earth and Heaven.‚Äù But as I woke To this poor world again, almost with tears, Not wholly did the vision fade, but still Those high processions lingering with me seemed To purify my soul. What was the world, Its low designs and hopes, its earth-born joys, Base grovelling pleasures, and unfruitful pains, To those and such as they‚Äîthose eyes that saw Not earth, but Heaven; those stainless feet that trod Through lilied meads of saintly sacrifice And strange unearthly snows? Surely 'twas well To have seen them clearer than the mists of earth Concede to waking sight. Come thou again, Fair dream, and often, till thou art a dream No more, but waking. March to victory, Great army, from the legendary Past, Through the brief Present, where Life's pilgrims toil To-day, and rise triumphant, or fall prone, Prest by their load; through that unnoted tract Of the dim Future which our thought pourtrays, Far fairer than the world's sad Past; which yet Shall have its struggles too, its sins, its wrongs, Its saints, its martyrs! March in spotless line, Lengthening the ranks of those who, gone before, Are now triumphant, till the End shall come, Which hushes all our lower strifes, attunes Discords to harmonies, rounds and makes complete The cycle of our Lives; till Sacrifice And Pain are done, and Death, and the Dread Dawn Breaks which makes all things new, and the great Sun Rising upon the worlds, dispels the Night Of Man's sad Past, and routs the gathered clouds Of Evil, and ascends a Conqueror, Wielding full splendours of unwaning Day For ever! SONGS WITHOUT NOTES. AT A COUNTRY WEDDING. Bring roses, youths, red roses, with full hands; Bring lilies, maidens, snow-white, delicate; See at life's threshold full-lipped Eros stands, And white Loves hover round the flower-hung gate: Bring smiles and jocund strains, Laughter and jovial mirth; For still the young God reigns O'er all the earth. Sing carols, maidens, carols to his name: Sound, striplings, sound for joy a lusty note; Acclaim him, pipe and flute, as when he came To Hellas or old Nile in years remote; Raise gleeful hymns and high To the blue vault above; He lives, he cannot die, Immortal Love! Forget ye, as the wise earth doth forget, Calm in divine oblivion of the years, The slow-paced ages and their load, the fret Of hopes illusive, and distracting fears; The cares, the toils, the strife, Wherethrough man's labouring feet Have trod the round of life; Yet found it sweet. For fair as once was Hellas, fair and young Our June-lit England shows, and lovelier still Than clear Cephissus' waters ofttimes sung, Cool Isis doth her lilied fountains fill. Young is the earth, Youth knows not change, And Love renews himself‚Äîthe same As in dim years and regions strange His altar-flame. Thro' golden buttercups and crested grass, To the lone, ivied church beneath the yew, Gaily, oh white procession, gaily pass! 'Tis the old worship, tho' the rite be new. Thro' youth's full veins to-day The same quick pulses move; Still Hymen beareth sway And crowneth Love. Forget the tired earth's plenitude of years, Forget Time's weird √Üolian music sad; Touch not a chord, think not a thought, but cheers Lift high, lift only merry strains and glad. A little, little while we are, Sing youths and maids with joyous voice! Forget long hopes and issues far; To-day rejoice! Bring roses, youths, red roses, with full hands; Bring lilies, maidens, snow-white, delicate. FROM AN AMERICAN SERMON. By the late Bishop Phillips Brooks, of Massachusetts. Stretched open to high heaven Each humble rood of earth unsheltered lies, The worlds regard it from the vault of space, Serene, unnumbered eyes! Beneath it everywhere Are centred living fires which seethe and glow; A little from the surface you shall reach The dreadful depths below. Clear brook or stately stream Struggling through flowers, or rolling silently Majestic waters, lose themselves alike In the surrounding sea. So every human soul, Set here betwixt its twin eternities, Stands open to Heaven's eye, fares on to doom 'Mid opposite mysteries. And tho' immured it seem, By narrow walls of circumstance confined, Shut from Heaven's face, closed to all vital airs, Is blown through by God's wind. Aye, tho' the deep shaft's side Obscure the eye of noon, yet new stars shine; Tho' day is blinded, a new lucid night Opens its eyes divine. There is no port of life So landlocked from the deep, so dead, so still, But sometimes, spume-flecked from the Infinite Sea, Fresh tides in-rushing fill. There is not lot so low No glimpse of cloudless heaven nor faint-eyed star Can reach it, wake it, shine on it, nor bring Some radiance from afar; No soul so cold or calm But underneath it burns the infernal fire; None so cast down, so vile, It may not to the heaven of heavens aspire. Above, beneath, around, Dread destinies encompass great and small; One Will, one Hand, one all-regarding Eye, Surveys and governs all. DAY DAWN. A fresh breeze wakes over land and sea With the dawning of day; A trouble, a travail, a newness beginning to be As the mists roll away; And the young God, his pennons glancing with roseate light, Routs the cohorts of Night. And the dark shadows curdle and then grow gray, Then a sound as of wings Divides the thin gloom as it melts and is hurried away; Some sentinel sings, And, proud with the conqueror's pride for the victory won, Forth issues the sun. THE SOUL IN NATURE. What is the message of the thunderous main? Or secret of the lone, untrodden hills? What spell the starry midnight silence fills? Or wakes the tossing woods to shrieks of pain? They are but water, earth or air; Shall things material, dread or fair, Our soaring flights and heavenward aims control, And within mundane limits chain the imperious soul? What is the glamour of the kindling eye, The golden locks, the lip, the cheek of youth? They are but forgeries of hidden Truth, Which Time, unheeding, flouts and passes by, Thin, fleeting visions swiftly past, But such fair dreams can longer last And deeper than reality inspire The prisoned soul, and touch her lips with fire. The soul it is! the soul! which sits alone And mirrors all things in her depths and draws Brute Nature to her own sufficing laws, And on the Heights of Being maketh moan For Fate, for fixed Necessity Which rules her, nor will set her free But snatches her thro' endless wastes of space On strong dark wings, but veils its awful face. Therefore on all things would she set her sign, Mirroring in her deeps all things that are, Projects herself beyond the faintest star, Seeking where'er she flies a Face Divine, And, being Time's first-born and chief, Nurses some fixed yet vague belief, Half fearful lest some alien Presence rise And blight her hope with unregarding eyes. THE FALSE PAST. In the Golden Past Summer skies were brighter, Youth more frank and loyal, Age more true and tender, Love sincere and selfless, In the Golden Past! In the Golden Past Men were more as brothers, High and low drawn closer, Faith's clear face serener, Sophist voices silent, In the Golden Past! Ah, the Golden Past! Ah, the dreaming fancies! Thin, illusive glamour! Flouting out poor Present, Paling man's bright Future, False and fabulous Past! THE VOICE OF SPRING. When birds salute the loitering dawn, And faint, warm sunbeams wake the bee, From the dim fields of Memory The veil is year by year withdrawn. The dear, dead Springs revive once more, And I grow young again; Sweet is the world again, as 'twas of yore, And thought of parted joys is precious pain. Woo the pale flowers, blithe bee; sing, rippling voice; Rejoice, be glad, and I too will rejoice. When the white pear-bloom lights the wall, And gilly-flowers embalm the air; When shining chestnut-cases fall, And lilacs cluster fair; When 'mid the bursting coverts show The blue-eyed violets and the wind-flowers' snow, Or starry celandines with shining gold, The old, dead Springs, forgot by all but me, Their vanished blooms unfold. Can I forget the buried years? Not then, not then, shall I forget Life's fresh dawns dewy-wet. Sing, thrush; flute, starling; hover, wanton bee, And wake a rapture dimmed by happy tears. What gives the youngling Spring a tongue to call? Till with swift step the ghostly Past draws nigh, Our Midsummers are dumb; No voice is theirs, nor spell which can enthrall; Their painted garden-glories, high and sweet, Blow silently and fleet unheeded by; No message brings the white rose or the red From Junes remote and dead. Nay, even the cloistered lilies virginal Awake no stirrings of unrest divine. The autumnal glories fine, From ripeness to decay, Are mute, and pass away; The reddening orchards and the yellowing wheat Steal by with noiseless feet, The glowing pageant marching voicelessly On its appointed way till Winter come. These flower within the present, or bear fruit; But all their Past is mute, And the dead days of Winter speak no word Of years long done, nor touch an answering chord. But not a snowdrop lights the wintry gloom, And not a crocus flames from out the grass, And not a primrose smiles on bank or lea, And not a cherry hides its sprays in bloom; But suddenly for me The gray mists lift, the gathered shadows pass, The undying Past once more begins to be, The daisy and the lamb upon the field Are wonders new-revealed; Youth's long-strange thoughts return, the world grows gay, And with the increasing day The tide of Time ebbs refluent, and I seem To hear again the hurrying, high-voiced stream Laugh by Life's founts; for whom long since the deep, Slow-footed, rolls asleep Thro' hushed autumnal marshes to the sea. Then wake, oh world, again; Dear vanished Springs, revive for young and old, Shine, morning years with scarce-abated gold; Return, oh sweet half-pain, That comest of remembrance of years done. A little while we are beneath the sun; Let us not all forget The treasure of long hope redoubled by regret: The springtides of the soul, which in that strange new birth Shall blossom once again, if never else on earth. IN THE BEGINNING. How first did the Cosmical Order cohere from the voids of space? What was the secret law of its being, or fashion of birth? What bound the compacted atoms in numberless Suns, as in Earth, Till the young orbs circled for ever, each in its place? What else than a vibrant thrill, which throbbed from the central brain, Pulsing through limitless space with a silent harmonious beat, Keeping the rhythm unchanged of some weird and mystical strain, Till the synchronous waves of the ether grew one, and the Worlds complete. Even as by a vibrant note, when the film or the sand is stirred, The separate atoms cohere in the form of a perfect flower, The Ineffable Spirit at first, the Eternal Infinite Word, Breathed, and the Universe blossomed in perfectness under its power. Still the great World's symphony sounds, if only our souls might hear; Still, to a mystical music, the suns in their courses ring; Still, by secret rhythms unheard, are ruled the revoluble spheres, And together as at the first the stars of the morning sing. Oh, mighty inaudible music which holdest and governest all, Sound, sound on our mortal ears thy note of heavenly rest, On our warring, discordant souls let Thy gracious harmonies fall, Till our inmost recesses of being are filled with Thy voice and are blest. And when Thy compelling Will, unseen Creator, is done, Let Thy Seraph peal a new note at dawn from Thy heavenly gate, Till Thy Cosmical Order dispels, like a mist in the rising sun, And Thy great orbs are lost in the void, and Thy Universe uncreate! ON A POEM CROSSING THE ATLANTIC. A little sheaf of words I speed Across the storm-vext wintry wave, Not knowing if 'twill float, indeed, Or find in grisly depths a grave. Tossed, on the vast Atlantic deep It ventures; icebergs from the north Assail it, blinding sea-mists creep‚Äî Through all it flies undaunted forth. The strong ship heels beneath the blast, The giant engines throb and thrill, That mighty heart beats fiercely still Till the long enterprise is past. And with it done, the little scroll This hand has written, from the sea Is born, with some faint trace of me, A child begotten of the soul. Then if at length some joy it give To souls by life's great load opprest, Cheer some poor fainting heart to live, Or bring some weary traveller rest, More than the meed of gold or fame Or honour to my soul it brings, For now it speaks with lips of flame, And lifted on celestial wings. ICARUS. 'Twas a beautiful morning in Spring, Bud and blossom were everywhere, Glad youth, on its newly-tried wing, Blithe renewal on earth and in air. And one immature fledgling had come, Enfranchised that day from the nest, Like our children who, parting from home, Fly far to the East or the West. What a spreading of fluttering wings! What chirpings, what pride in then child! As, forgetting terrestrial things, The parents for gladness grow wild. 'Tis a lesson in flight, they essay, As, led by the teaching of love, The feeble wings flutter away, The weak limbs endeavour to move. Now before and above him they dart, With short flights and encouraging calls; Now the poor pupil harmlessly falls, Engrossed in his half-attained art. And the neighbours and gossips, who sit On the twigs of the bushes around, Join the clamorous chorus and flit Up and down 'twixt their seats and the ground. Long lasted the lesson. At length Those feeble wings tempted the air Full a yard, in their newly found strength! You had thought they had Icarus there! Such chirpings, such shouts of applause! Such a chorus of innocent glee! Unconscious that under the tree Crept a monster with pitiless jaws. Quick! a flash and a dart and a spring, And the learner, with terror-choked breath, Sharp pain, and a profitless wing, Is snatched by the spoiler to death. Was it Nature that doomed him? Why, then, Did I start from my place in pursuit, Forgetting the usage of men, More brutal by far than the brute? Vain chase! O'er a neighbouring wall, They vanish; yet somehow to-day I hear the poor parents' sad call, When their darling was ravished away. AT THE GATE. Thro' the young morning, mile on mile, On my swift wheel alone I glide; See wood and field and hamlet smile, And all the landscape glorified. A young man freed from toil at length, Who labour far from friends and home, Glad with the joy of youth and strength, To these sweet solitudes I come. And on this summer morning calm, The long week's dust and turmoil done, Leave the dull town, to drink the balm Of scented pines and take the sun, And let the country's peace and rest Sink on my restless soul, and breed A kindred quiet in my breast, And hints of some sufficing creed. The grey church fills; the cheerful ray Soft on the latticed casements falls; Softly the breath of summer day Plays spiced with June around the walls. And quickly thro' the golden leas The dutiful processions wend, Then thro' the arching secular trees, Like those who seek a faithful friend. The mad chimes haste, then slower come, Toll gravely, and at last grow dumb, And thro' the wide doors, faint and dim, Float the first echoes of the hymn. Beneath this thick-leaved elm awhile, Forgetful of the turbid street, I rest, and let the influence sweet The fever of my soul beguile. For it is Sunday everywhere. The lark a Sabbath carol sings, To blossomed meads and odorous air, And murmurous hum of wooing wings. The dozing teams beside the pool Whisk their long tails, and, fetlock-deep In dewy meadow-grasses cool, Munch lazily, then fall asleep. The bold pie chatters in the shade, Well knowing she is safe to-day; Fearless the moorhens dip and wade, The bounding conies fearless play. All breathes a seeming calm and rest; The glad world sleeps a Sabbath sleep; While on boon Nature's tranquil breast God's peace, His careless creatures keep. Shall I not worship, then, with these, Old trees and fleeting flowers that blow? Share the great Mother's joyous ease, And watch her long-plumed grasses grow, And let the spirit of old earth Grow one with mine till both shall fly, Winged by some new, mysterious birth, Beyond the confines of the sky? Here in this long-aisled avenue, Roofed only by the unbounded blue, Are liturgies diviner yet Than those the pitiless years forget. Here from these blithe, untutored lays Of chanting birds serene and clear, A sweeter symphony of praise Ascends to take the Eternal ear Than in yon humble church hard by; Nay, in the immemorial quires Of twilight-minsters soaring high, The worshipper's rapt soul inspires. But can unaided Nature draw Our worship? Can her stern decrees, Triumphant Strength, unbending Law, Fit praying hands and bended knees? Shows she, Benign, Almighty, Just, Who slays the Unit for the Race, Whom neither Pity moves nor Grace; Whose cold voice cries, ‚ÄúWhat must be, must;‚Äù To whom the fairest human Soul, Tho' with a thousand jewels drest‚Äî Purity, reverence, self-control, Love, aspiration for the best‚Äî Is less than his who laughs to scorn All laws but hers, and breaks in twain Poor hearts, and lives his life in vain‚Äî A vile life, better never born; Who unregarding, stalks through blood And suffering, blindly to her end, Nor shrinks from Ill, nor yearns for Good, Careless whate'er the Future send; Who framed the tiger, tooth and claw, The eagle's rending beak, the snake With poison-fangs and coils, to take Fresh victims for the ravening maw. The very ground on which I lie Bears rapine on each blade of grass. Stern rapine wings the dragon-fly, The darting swifts that glance and pass. And in yon flower-faced, slumbrous pool Pain wakes and rapine day and night. The same unchanging evil rule The terror of unpitying Might. See, a swift trouble cuts the air, A rush of cruel, arrowy wings, And yon blithe throstle as she sings, To death the pouncing talons bear. And singled from the helpless throng, Despairing, faint, with failing breath, Half blind, a coney limps along, With, close behind, unerring Death. Nay, not to her I kneel. I hold Better than this the Atheist's creed, Which chills the heart with accents cold, If thus I may supply my need. Tho' the world teem with wrong and pain, What matter, if no Power Divine Framed this rebellious soul of mine, This soul which drags and loathes its chain? The great World-System on its course Goes unregarding, dumb, and blind; How reach the dull, deaf ear of Force, Or touch with ruth its careless mind? Not this I worship. 'Twere to kneel In a void shrine, whose God had fled; We only worship when we feel; We owe no reverence to things dead. And can this dim Abstraction fill The hungry heart, the soul that yearns For ever closer union still With that far central Life which burns, And lights, and first did animate All things that are, and can control The infinite orbits, small and great, And Man's immeasurable soul? For surely, though far off He is, We hear His voice, not only here, But in the clamorous city; clear It speaks through precious sanctities. How shall a young man cleanse his way, His sore-tried way, save by the thought, Too precious for his lips to say, Which points to some diviner ‚ÄúOught‚Äù? The flaring streets allure to sin; Evil besets his lonely bed; Heaven seems too strait to enter in, Too faint the precepts of the dead. Yet oft the Tempter's voice in vain Assails him; oft the thought of home And simple childhood's whiteness come, And give him strength to strive again; Or if he fall, yet shall he rise, And, breaking the dark jails of sense, See a white radiance light the skies, And hail recovered Innocence. Were Conscience dumb, did Nature bind, Even as the brutes are bound, my mind, I were content as those to be, Nor seek invisible Deity. But hark! through all the House of Life, The cloistered cell, the clamorous crowd, Night's cool and calm, Day's dust and strife, A voice of Godhead pleading loud. Shall I then kneel with those, and raise My voice with theirs; who know of old The Century's deep disease, which slays Our Faith, and strikes our yearnings cold‚Äî I who have listened while the coarse, Glib unbeliever marshalled out His legions of unfaithful Doubt, And found no other God but Force, And held the Christian tale in scorn, The God-like Victim virgin-born, The atoning pain, the mystic Cross, The sacred salutary loss? What care I? God there is, I know, Who rules the Worlds and bade us be; But shall He care for things below, And show His hidden face to me? Too far away He seems to stand, Too bright, if present, for our need; Nor else than through the Faith, His hand Has given us, know we Him, indeed. No other gave He. The strong Hours Have wreaked in vain their age-long Powers, Unchanged as from His lips it came; To-day it lives and rules the same. Enough for me, and for my need; Enough for dear lives dead and gone; No other Faith is ours, nor Creed, To speed the labouring ages on. Then since He is, and since no more Without Him can I live and move, I join the ranks of Faith and Love, And rise and enter and adore! SURSUM. ‚ÄúThe Rose is sweet no more,‚Äù I hear a voice complain; ‚ÄúThe morning-glow of yore Comes not again. ‚ÄúNo more the sunset skies Keep their old molten gold; Life and the world grow cold,‚Äù That sad voice sighs. But look! Far overhead, Scarce risen, scarce begun, In nascent glory spread, Another sun. And from the mountain snows, on golden feet, Life's Lord leaps down, and makes Creation sweet. And every opening flower Breathes with a perfumed breath, Day's new ascending power Dispelling Death. And the world, risen from the shame of night, Turns to the Orient and acclaims the Light. ‚ÄúSWEETHEART, FORBEAR.‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart, forbear.‚Äù Thus said I to my dear. She, with rebellious grace, And light of wayward fancy on her face, And some half-smile, half-tear: ‚ÄúNay, silence is not peace. 'Twere better far than this wholly to cease, If I should know no more The rapture of revolt, the joyous strife, The free unfettered air I breathed before.‚Äù So we long time assailed with hot debate, And kindling voice and word, Deep problems, which a myriad souls have stirred‚Äî Foreknowledge, Freedom, Fate‚Äî Till, wearied out at last, Hand clasped in hand, without a word we twain, Gazing at moonrise on the silvered main, Knew a strange calm enfold our doubt with peace, And all the stress and conflict stilled and past. DAY AND NIGHT. Night comes and hides away The splendours of the Day; Death, like a veil, makes dark Life's spark. But as upon the sky Soon as the sunbeams die, Glimmers some feeble star Afar, Life, hidden from our eyes, Rises on other skies, And draws from suns more bright New light. MARATHON. This is the very place, The hills, the plain, the sea, Calm nature changeth not Whate'er may be. Here, here the Eastern wave, Myriads of warlike men, Surged vainly on the shore, Then sank again. Two thousand years and more Have vanished since the day When that barbarian host Faded away. Worse tyrannies have come, Flood after bitter flood; Long time the loathly Turk Bathed Greece in blood. But of that old fierce fight Clear memories linger yet; Dark histories roll between, Yet none forget. To-day as twilight falls Upon the darkling plain, The ghosts of the great Past Contend again. Still on that haunted marsh The affrighted peasant hears Barbaric shouts arise, Shields clash with spears. Groans, cries of mortal strife, And trampling chivalry, Where the lone hills survey The sailless sea. TO BEATRICE. June, 1890. Thrice bless√©d among women was thy lot Whose mien, whose face, whose eye, whose soul's pure fire, Our firstborn Christian singer could inspire Through his dark widowed days, when thou wert not; Who 'mid the piteous sights and sounds of Hell Wert a clear Star, guiding to Paradise, Till last, awaking to thy gracious eyes, After his weary wanderings, all was well! O spiritual stainless Love and pure, Who taught'st that yearning soul and voice to soar Beyond dread heights unscaled as yet by song! Here the slow ages labour, halt with wrong. For thee, for him, is joy for evermore, Blessing and blest, while God and Right endure. FOR A CHILDREN'S HOLIDAY. Ye to whom wealth lends wings To bear you from clime to clime, To treasures of beautiful things‚Äî Palaces, minsters sublime, Snow mountain and pine-circled lake, And the purple of Summer seas‚Äî Think, think of poor children, and take Compassion on these. For in stifling courts they are pent Thro' the fugitive freshness of June; Not for them are her roses sent, Nor the nightingales' passionate tune, Nor the keen scent of newly mown hay, Nor the flowing tide's blossom of yeast; Let these poor rhymes secure them at least One ineffable day! FOR A SCHOOL REGISTER. Dear school, grey church, which dim years since I knew, The swift-paced years that hurry youth to age, Fond memory turns with grateful eye to you, And welcomes gladly this recording page. For, tho', indeed, the vanished days show brief Since I too, was a boy, ah me! how strong The fence, how deep the gulf, which Time the thief Broadens in hope to still the voice of song! And they, my eager comrades, where are they? Low lies how many a sunny boyish head, Some in hot youth, and some grown sad and grey, With hopes burnt out and aspirations dead! And some beneath the tropic East sleep sound, Some the Deep hides, and some the pathless West; Mid lonely wolds, or loud streets surging round Some toil with failing powers that long for rest. And some have risen and gained the crown of life, And some, their equals, missed the meed they sought; On most there looms to-day an end of strife, For most the play is played, the fight is fought. But changeless still the minster towers, and still Grey walls re-echo, as the careless race Of young lives, hurrying onward, comes to fill The ancient courts with Youth's pathetic grace. Long may they come, for though relentless Fate Aim her keen shafts sometimes, and sometimes send Misfortune, still our Sherborne shall be great, And he is wisest who awaits the end. Long may she live to keep old memories green! And still, while England stands unshattered, last! And may this page which tells what she has been, Link a bright Future with a cherished Past. HOMER, BLIND. This is the tale wise Aristoteles, Master of knowledge wider than his time, Fired by some rare poetic fervour, told: The young Homeros meditating much The tale of Troy divine, o'er all the shores Of Troas wandered, if perchance his eyes Might take some vivid memory of the Past To fire his song. Long on the desert plain He fed his solitary muse with thoughts Of that great pageant‚ÄîHector, and his sire Priamos; Agamemnon with his hosts; The fair false Helen, and her perjured Lord And all the varied fortunes of the fight, Till tower and temple sank in blood and fire. And last, beside the narrow waters came Of Hellespont, and there, one dreaming day, Knelt where within a time-worn tomb were laid, White ashes hid within an urn of gold, Achilles and Patroklos side by side. Then gradually to his musing eye The Past gave up its secret, and he saw All things as they had been. The brazen prows Leapt o'er the waves. Again a fresh breeze woke The blue √Üg√¶an, and the oarsmen, bent Upon their well-ranged benches, sheared again The crisp white surges of the purple sea; The bustle of the landing; the long line Of white tents ranged beneath the untaken walls; The dull delays; the virgin sacrificed In vain; the weary winters and the tale Of daily war and death. But most his mind Turned to the young Achilles, the best bloom Of chivalry of old, his mystic birth, His goddess-mother, his heroic youth, His perfect manhood, and his early doom Before the unconquered town, till last his soul Grew fired, and he possessed. Then, as he gazed With a fixed gaze upon the tomb, behold There rose a gleaming phantom in a mist Of silvery light‚Äîsilvery his panoply, His greaves, his crested helmet and his spear, And silvery as a statue, the strong limbs, The fair proud face, the god-like symmetry Of a young hero, like a blazing star Burned with white fire, and straight the gazer knew The presence of Achilles. As he looked, Brighter and keener still the vision grew, As when the Goddess with a bath of fire Purged out the mortal alloy from her child In Phthia long ago. And then no more He gazed, but, with the exceeding splendour blind, No longer saw the aspect of the sun, Nor earth, nor any more the purple sea, Nor Dawn, nor Eve, but one Heroic Day Lighted his inner vision till he died, And left the Ages brighter for his loss. OCTOBER 6, 1892. Dear Friend and honoured Master, art thou dead? And shall I see no more thy reverend face, Recall our older England's manlier grace? Nor any more admire that noble head, That brow as high as Shakespeare's, that grave eye, Now soft with mirth, now fired with fantasy? Nor hear again thy rugged, kindly speech Illume the sunless deeps of thought, and teach The Right thou lov'dst? nor breathe the eager air Of thy lone eyrie with thee? nor behold Thy bent, cloaked figure, dark against the gold And purple of thy dear, secluded hill, Pace with uncertain footsteps day by day The much-loved round? nor in the failing light Upon thy smooth lawns watch the summer night Steal o'er the ghostly plains? nor mark the strain Of thy blithe thrushes with thee? nor again The enamoured, lonely nightingale complain? Thy years were come to harvest‚Äîhomespent years Of reverence from without, of love within. A perfect life, health, riches, honours, fame‚Äî All these were thine, no prize was left to win; Scant sorrow, save that fine despondency Which fans the smouldering genius into flame; Only two brief experiences of tears‚Äî The dear friend lost in youth, the son in age, Bracing thy soul to bear whate'er should be. Such lives Fate grants not often, nor for long, And rarest to the suffering ranks of song. Why should we mourn, save for our private pain And friendship which shall never come again? Our race can never lose thee, whose fair page, Rich with the harvest of a soul inspired, So many a weakling life and heart has fired. Thou art not wholly gone, but livest yet Till thy great England's sons their tongue forget! Thy place is with the Immortals. Who shall gauge Thy rank among thy peers of worldwide song? Others, it may be, touched a note more strong, Scaled loftier heights, or glowed with fiercer rage; But who like thee could slay our modern Doubt? Or soothe the sufferers with a tenderer heart? Or deck gray legends with such knightly grace? Or nerve Life's world-worn pilgrims for their part? Who, since our English tongue first grew, has stirred More souls to noble effort by his word? More reverent who of Man, of God, of Truth? More piteous of the sore-tried strength of Youth? Others of grosser clay might stoop to fire Ignoble lusts with prostituted lyre. Thy chaste, white Muse, loathing the Pagan rout, Would drive with stripes the goatish Satyr out. Thy love of Righteousness preserved thee pure; Thy lucid genius scorned to lurk obscure, And all thy jewelled art and native grace Were consecrate to God and to the Race. This day extinguishes a star as bright As shone upon our dying century. Here, as in that great England over sea, ‚ÄúLight after light goes out,‚Äù yet 'tis not night. The peaceful moonbeams kissed him as he lay At midnight, dying in the arms of Love.‚Äî Thou couldst not wait the dawn of earthly Day.‚Äî Farewell, blest soul, farewell! And if, indeed, Some care for things of earth may mount above, As is our hope, enfranchised Spirit, plead For this our England, which thou lov'dst so long, And crownedst with thy diadem of song! MARIE ANTOINETTE. October 16, 1893. A hundred years ago to-day The treacherous city of the Seine Sent forth her heartless myriads gay To mock a friendless woman's pain. Light mirth and laughter everywhere, As though some nuptial pageant came, Awake the brisk autumnal air, No touch of ruth, no thought of shame. Roofs, casements, flag-draped balconies, A-fire with cruel, gloating eyes; Festering below with curses loud, Fenced back by steel, the tigerish crowd; Till the slow tumbril rolls in sight, Fronting the gathering roar, the howl, The jests obscene, the insults foul, And a fair mother, robed in white, Sits bowed with bleaching hair‚Äîa Queen For all the sufferings that have been,‚Äî Who casts no glance on either side, Untouched by shame, or fear, or pride. Calm lips, from which no word may come; Though the priest pray, serenely dumb. Surely death's bitterness is past, And 'tis deliverance comes at last. Till as she nears the palace home, Void of the treasures of her love, Some poignant memory seems to come, Some pang that widowed heart to move. And then the end! Sad, murdered Queen! Poor mother, slain for other's wrong! Guiltless, thou barest what had been The sum of dark oppressions long. Still, down a century of years To death thou passest, white-robed, fair‚Äî The calm eyes that had shed their tears, The silent lips, the faded hair. ANARCHY. Paris, February 5, 1894. The night is blinded with rain, No light in the casements is seen; Thro' the blank streets, long before dawn, Rolls the van with the guillotine. Save the quick stroke of hammers alone, With their petulant hurry of sound, There is scarcely a murmur that comes From the sullen groups lingering round; For the sombre toilers who go To their task, ere the day has risen, Tarry silently on their way Before the grim walls of the prison. Till at last all is ready, and see! The black scaffold frowning on high, Where before the sun rises to-day On the fair town, a felon shall die. All is silent, till sudden there bursts On the stillness a roystering crowd, Reeling forth from their dens of the night, With coarse jests and with blasphemies loud. Gay masquers of Carnival-time, Ghastly-cheeked, crimson-lipped, hollow-eyed, Rouged harlots, mock-Churchmen, a swarm Of the reckless on every side. But as to the scaffold they press, Something strikes that lewd populace dumb, As swift from the gates of the gaol They behold the fierce criminal come. Very pale and erect, unafraid, With firm paces and regular breath, This priest of a murderous creed Goes calm as a martyr to death. ‚ÄúLong live Anarchy! Death to the State! And you bourgeois!‚Äù No penitent word. But a deep silence broods o'er the crowd; Not a cry, scarce a murmur is heard. Then the masquers go wearily home, And the corpse to the surgeons. And yet A voice cries, ‚Äú'Twas a century since That they killed Marie Antoinette.‚Äù THE HYMN OF KLEANTHES. The famous Greek hymn quoted by St. Paul at Athens. Lord of the deathless Gods, howsoever men name Thee, Almighty God, prime Ruler of Nature, through high law governing all things, Hail! since Thy will permits that Thy mortal creatures address Thee, For from Thee our Race is sprung, and is fashioned after Thy image, Alone of all mortal things that live and move under heaven. Thee therefore alone will I hymn, Thy might will I celebrate always! Thee the Cosmical Order which whirls around earth in its orbit Obeys wheresoever Thou leadest, and willingly follows thy guidance! For in Thy resistless hands so strong a weapon Thou wieldest, At whose dread stroke all things in Nature tremble with terror‚Äî A two-edged fiery brand, the living bolt of Thy lightning! With might Thou directest aright Thy pervading Word, which thro' all things Pulses, commingling alike with the greater lights and the lesser. Spirit! There is no deed that is done on earth's circuit without Thee, Nor in Thy wondrous ethereal sphere, nor on Thy wide ocean, Save only the wrongs which the wicked commit of their own unwisdom. Wise art Thou too to redress the uneven lot by the even; Bringest to order, disorder, and givest Thy love to the loveless; For thus Thou hast fitted together all things, the good with the evil, So that there is over all, one Word and Reason Eternal, Which the wicked flee, or seeing avoid, unhappy! ill-fated! Ay, and those too whose desire is for good, and yearn to possess it, Either discern not Thy law universal, or, knowing it, heed not, While if they had but obeyed, heart and mind, their lives had grown noble. Surely all men set forth without guidance on varying courses! Some with precipitate haste on the difficult struggle for glory; Some without shame, with their faces steadfastly turned to wards riches, Some to enjoyment alone, and the pleasant works of the body; Hurrying on, every one, on the opposite way to their wishes! But, oh Lord! Giver of all! cloud enshrouded! Ruler of lightning, Ward off from men, of Thy mercy, the bitter curse of unwisdom! Father, disperse from the soul that thick darkness, and give them to compass Wisdom, by whose strong aid Thou with righteousness governest all things, So that we, honoured of Thee, may in turn requite Thee with honour, Praising Thy wonderful works evermore as is fitting for mortals, Seeing that no higher reward comes to any on earth or in heaven Than to hymn Thy cosmical Law, which ruleth with Justice for ever. THREE LAY HYMNS. I. Come Thou again. The world grows old, And Faith's fire wanes and hearts grow cold; The years defraud Thee of Thy due; Come Thou, and, coming, make things new. But shouldst Thou come again indeed With a new Name, and modern creed, Hearts which are loyal to Thee still Might doubt Thy new-reveal√®d will. And Thou, with Thy enfranchised Word, Not peace wouldst bring us, but a sword; And all Thy former gracious Past Might rise to hinder Thee at last. Yet come. The mystic beat of Time, The dead years' measured march sublime, The very truths Thy voice first taught, Grown sovereign, bring Thy power to naught. Each weary age deceasing brings Dust of dead creeds and soulless things, So that no more our souls discern Through their thick haze Thy precepts burn. Dead thoughts which ere Thy earthly years Had marred the Race with lust and tears, Arraign Thy Word, Thy Life, Thy Love, Thy Cross on earth, Thy Throne above. And some, with wandering fires grown blind No more the face of Godhead find, And are content, rejecting Thee, Aimless and rudderless to be; And some have sought in hopeless pain The styes of Pagan sense again, And in Thy place would fain install False gods with foulness for their all. And since so weak indeed we are, With Death so near and Heaven so far, With creeping mists of sin and sense Quench the white fire of innocence. Come Thou. Tho' brief to Thee appears The sum of nigh two thousand years, To lives like ours, which fleet so fast, They stretch a long abysmal Past. Come, if Thou wilt, with wider creed, To meet and satisfy our need; Or, if Thou wilt, come now as then, And fill the hungry hearts of men. Nor once, but often, come and fire Cold hearts, and doubting minds inspire; And from its depths of misery Lift a despairing world to Thee! II. Amid the blithe, resurgent spring, The buds that burst, the birds that sing, The first flowers on the tufted lea, A sad voice whispers constantly, ‚ÄúWherefore hast Thou forsaken me?‚Äù Thus spake to-day the sacred word, By souls desponding clearly heard, As of old time on Calvary, Not yet its power has ceased to be‚Äî ‚ÄúWherefore hast Thou forsaken me?‚Äù How many a martyr since, in pain, Has scanned the blinded heavens in vain For some consoling vision fair, Despised, rejected, in despair, And found no answering Presence there; Nor solace for his failing breath, But insults only, stripes and death; And yet, though the weak flesh might shrink, The soul, in hopeless suffering sink, Has drunk the cup 'twas His to drink. How many a pioneer of thought Sure, yet of all men set at nought, Has pined 'neath Love's averted eyes. Mourned peace, exchanged for tears and sighs, And seeming futile sacrifice; Yet borne, unholpen, to the end, Whatever fortune Truth might send, Content with life to free the slave, Tho' Doubt should sneer, and Force should rave, Who others, not himself, might save. Truth's precious martyrs these, and He Greatest since Time began to be, Adorable despondence, fine, Which links the human and divine, And yet the strength of strength was Thine! III. Where wouldst Thou I should go? The way Is dark, nor yet ascends the day; Confused, the mazy paths combine‚Äî I cannot yet distinguish mine. Wouldst Thou that up the soaring hill Breathless I climb and labour still? Or on the dull uncomely plain Shall sow and reap and sow again? Shall I, amid the dust and strife Of the thronged town, expend my life? Or watch the silent summers come, Gilding the skies and fields of home? Or best devote my nascent years To stay the flow of human tears? Or cloistered in some tranquil cell, Shall I, in praising Thee, do well? Or shall my studious footsteps stray Down Learning's still, untroubled way, And, led by princely souls of yore, Advance Thought's realm a footpace more? Or in the wrangling Senate take No care for aught, but for Thy sake, Content to raise the multitude To some faint glimpse of Thee and Good? Or, better in the busy mart Remind the worldling that Thou art Working Thy humbler work, which lies Not less on earth than in the skies? Or strive to fix with half-amaze The beauty of my inward gaze? Or with lips fired by yearnings strong Clothe Thy ineffable word with song? Guide with Thy light my faltering feet Where Life's perplexing pathways meet; Call Thou me with Thy silent voice, And I will follow and rejoice! THE STRONG MAN. Tho' Disappointment dog his feet, And currish Malice wound his heel; Tho' none his rare successes greet Nor for his frequent failures feel; Tho' the jade Fortune vex him still With one unchanging frown of spite; She shall not bend his steadfast will, Nor turn his footsteps from the Right. What are to him her crooked ways, The worthless gifts her hands withhold? The dross which dullards take for gold, The insult of unworthy praise? Alone, serene, secure, he is A rock 'mid troubled deeps, a tree Rooted in hidden sanctities, And, keeping those, content to be. Despite the shrill, abusive throng, The selfish silence of the great, Who dares to suffer and be strong Is master of himself and Fate. JANUARY 14, 1892. There rang a cheerful note Of preparation through the approving land; The Royal guests were bidden from lands remote, Waiting, the people stood a loyal band. Almost one heard the mad chimes to the skies Flinging their joyous music. Now one bell Alone the wintry silence breaks and dies, Solemn and slow; and hark‚Äîit is a knell! My voice was fain to sing Of innocent nuptials and requited love, When, at the swift approach of coming spring, The few brief lagging weeks should lightlier move; No graver theme might come Than these to occupy my dreaming thought; But a black, sudden darkness rose unsought Across the sun, and struck the singer dumb. Our England stands to-day As Rome stood once, the Empire of the Race, And this young life should sway More than a C√¶sar's realm, with kinglier grace, With youth's long hopes elate, And blameless recompense of faithful love. Could no Power stay the dread decree of Fate, Nor all a Nation's prayers and pity move? Stretched on his lonely bed, Within his boyhood's dear familiar home, The Heir of England lieth cold and dead; After brief days of pain the end has come. His mother and his love Watched through the fevered nights, and then he went! Hast thou no pity for the innocent, Dread Power, whom neither prayers nor tears can move? The wintry landscape round Lies in its shroud of snow. No breath of spring Nor song of bird is there, nor joyous sound. Soon, soon the mating birds shall wake and sing, But he no more shall hear The jubilant concert nor the fruitful strife. Gone where no earthly hope shall come, nor fear; Dead at the opening door of Love and Life. Dead, but beyond the tomb Which takes us, Love's white flower renewed again, Leaving our earthly winter's loss and pain. In its Lord's garden-ground shall spring and bloom; There wedded souls shall be In union, when the harsh dividing years Are swept into the Past, and leave us free, And parting is no more, nor grief, nor tears. Ay, but not less the blow Falls crushing, nor less dread the Power we fight, Whose way-worn hearts Life's countless sorrows know, Who walk by faith alone, and not by sight. Youth, innocence, happiness Fall thus untimely; shadows we indeed, And shadows we pursue, yet not the less Our souls triumphant hold a heavenlier creed. Lay him among the dust Of world-worn kings within the Royal tomb. None came there, none, more blameless or more just. Let this white Presence light their age-long gloom; And let one singer tell, Touched to the heart, how in his youthful prime, The Heir of England comes released from Time, And pray God keep him, and a last Farewell! ODE ON THE OPENING OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, MAY 10, 1893. Six years have fled since rose amid the flowers The vast pavilion with its courtly throng, And with the trumpets' blare, to prayer and song, Where soars to-day a coronal of towers, The Empire swept along. Long years! To-day the same Imperial hand Which laid the granite holds a golden key, Fair token of the visible unity Which binds together, while these proud walls stand, Our Britain, land and sea. To-day our dream, embodied, greets our eyes, A thousand toiling brains and hands have wrought, The worker's willing strength, the provident thought, And lo! the a√´ry domes and towers arise Clear on the vernal skies. Not of our colder Northern Art sedate, But lighter, blending East and West in one, A flower of Fancy, quickened by the sun, Yet keeping still, to guard our Regal state, The Lions at the gate. And thro' the stately chambers everywhere, And corridors, with vein√´d marbles, fine, The treasures of the wood, the sea, the mine All kindly fruits, our wide dominions bear, And corn, and oil, and wine, With all the gains enfranchised Labour brings, Are ranged to-day to deck these ordered halls, Whereon no shadow of the sheathed sword falls, But Peace, an angel, folds her golden wings, And Commerce smiling calls. Dream, Prince, the dream which drew thy Sire and thee: The Imperial dream! Here let the toiler come And find sure guidance to his waiting home And honest work, and rear in days to be New Britains over sea. Here let the Daughter-Nations, East and West, And North and South, take counsel and discern How fair the Mighty Mother is, and yearn With love renewed, content awhile to rest Safe on her loving breast; Till drawn together nearer, they shall bind Close bonds of love for all of British blood! Then, all our subject-realms in brotherhood! Then, our great alien kinsmen, heart and mind! Then, if Heaven will, Mankind! Peal, joy-bells, unawakened yet, nor cease! Peal till our isles and continents rejoice! Fling, far and wide, a new harmonious voice, While thro' long ages yet our realms increase! In Unity and Peace! TWO IMPRESSIONS. I. AT THE LAW COURTS. October 13, 1893. With awe-struck gaze, A little throng In dumb amaze. They point to where A broken rope Swings high in air. Down, down, through space The poor lad fell There, in that place. Stirred once, one groan Groaned as he lay Still on the stone; Then no more pain. See! now they cleanse The crimson stain Careless, hard by Poor vagrants drowse, We can but die! II. IN ST. MARTIN'S CHURCHYARD. February 5, 1894. The volleying schoolboys play, The mellow church-bells call; Muffled on this still bay Life's loud tides fall. Here would the blind man sit Through sunshine and through rain, With fingers that shall knit Never again. And by her master set His loyal, faithful guard‚Äî A rough-haired, keen-eyed pet‚Äî Kept watch and ward. Hung round her shaggy throat, A little pannikin Clinked as the passers-by Threw pennies in. She never strayed, but sate Patient through all the noise, Fronting, unmoved, sedate, The larcenous boys. Fulfilled with honest pride, If, when the hour was come, She of her skill might guide Her master home. The blind is blind no more. 'Tis two long months since he, Safe on life's further shore, Began to see. But passing where to-day At the familiar spot Through long past years, the pair Were, but are not, I marked with wondering eye And some unwonted thrill The faithful guardian lie, Observant still. Upor her shaggy feet She stretched her watchful head, With wistful gaze and sweet Waiting the dead. His empty seat was there, Vacant, but tended yet, The carpet's scanty square, The half-made net. Her useless pannikin Echoed no joyous clink; 'Twas filled with water now For her to drink. Marking those patient eyes, Unchanging, faithful, dumb, Whereon no doubt might rise, Nor shadow come, I thought if this brute love Thus shares our human grief, Dumb Trust which looks above And courts Belief, Would that some mystic voice Might reach that watching ear, ‚ÄúTake comfort, nay, rejoice! He is not here.‚Äù TO A SCHOOLGIRL. My schoolgirl scans with joy, Her fair head bending low, The god-like Tale of Troy, Bright eyes and cheeks aglow. Dear heart and innocent soul, Thee may the fleeting years, As the swift springtides roll, Bring joy, not tears. For thee may knowledge spread Her fair and ample page, Deep thoughts of sages dead, The poet's noble rage. The gains which science gives, The statesman's royal lore, The master-thought which lives For evermore. For thee let music wake Her deep mysterious chords, Which the rapt soul can take Higher than any words; Art's precious garden smile Through gates enwreathed with flowers, And fairy dreams beguile Thy simple hours. But let no learning dim Those frank and innocent eyes; Still let the morning hymn And daily suffrage rise. Leave knowledge, which the mind And not the heart can move Still, girl; thy treasure find In Faith and Love. LOVE AND AWE. Shall Love decease And die and leave no trace, Nor on Life's placid face A shadow fall and mar its peace? Some ghost of things, known, seen, or heard For ever haunts us, though without a word. Shall awe lie dead, And reverence, once felt? Where'er the soul has knelt It kneeleth, though its God be fled, And still within the empty shrine Seeketh some Phantasm, august, Divine. Nor love, nor awe Can die, nor live, alas! They are awhile, then pass, Obedient to the unbending Law They wax, they wane, yet changeless are, Even as the occultation of a star. ON AN EMPTY CAGE. The lilacs in the court were sweet, The high sun climbed to golden noon, And blithely down the tree-fringed street The sparrows chirped a merry tune. Whom thou, a golden darling dear, Didst greet with long roulades and trills, Like those that charm the list'ning ear Which some high-pitched soprano thrills. Mean folk indeed of husky throat And humble garb; not theirs as thine The graceful form, the amber coat, The sweet spontaneous fancies fine. But thou wert prisoned, they were free. Though thine the never-failing seed, The tepid bath, the fresh-plucked weed, 'Twas, oh! with those gay bards to be, Ay! tho' black monsters fiery-eyed Amid the thick-leaved shades might hide, And, noiseless, pounce and snatch away To instant death the helpless prey. 'Twas freedom that thou wouldst, not life, When boldly through the open door Thy weak wings fluttered to the strife, And weal and ease were thine no more. Thy girlish mistress stood in tears, And all the summer evening long Strained weary eyes and watching ears To see thy plume and catch thy song. In vain upon the balcony Thy old home welcomed, opened wide; Our grief, our calls thou didst deride; Thou wouldst not heed, thou wouldst be free. Nay, once thou didst flash by again, While after thee that lawless crowd With vulgar chirpings coarsely loud Mocked thy fine operatic strain. Then fell the night, and all was still, And, when the morning dawned, no more Thy waking note our ears might fill, Tho' still we kept the open door. And thou, where art thou? Did swift fate Snatch thee? A parable to me, Thy song, thy flight, thy open gate! Say, was it better to be free? PRO≈íMIA. I. For the Universal Review. Once for the myriad sounds which are, Mixed accents of the lettered throng, A few clear voices, deep and strong, Were borne afar. To-day through broken channels wide The broader stream of knowledge flows; Each year that passes, louder grows The clamorous tide. A thousand cares and hopes and fears Our fathers knew not, touch our souls; Thought's turbid current seaward rolls Its stream of tears. Not as of old time, faring free In joyous robes, is Knowledge drest, But, by its own great load opprest, Plods heavily. So grave we grow, we lose in part, The lightsome words and thoughts of old; Delving too deep for hidden gold, We starve the heart. Yet is Spring round us everywhere, Young lives expand, young thoughts are born; From ruins of dead days outworn, The world grows fair. Do we then raise a needless voice, If, mingling graver things with gay, We come to bid our troublous day Almost rejoice? If to our modern England stern, Depressed by clouds of care and doubt, Faint faiths which glimmer and go out, Fierce hates which burn, We bring some charm of Art, to light Life's gloomy road, some kindly gleam To cheer the Thinker's sombre dream, Some influence bright,‚Äî Art, not the handmaid of the Pen, But of her own strength, strong, complete, A star to guide the weary feet Of thought-worn men? Or if we strive to bind in one, By mutual knowledge closely drawn, Our chain of Empires spread from dawn To set of sun? Or if with open page we seek To hold a hand of welcome forth To the gay South, the sober North, For all to speak, Telling how Thought and Fancy grow Beyond our wild, dividing sea, Till from that peaceful comity New friendships glow? Or if, since Woman too has come To climb the lostier steeps of mind, New listeners we aspire to find By hearth and home; Nor listeners only, but combine With man's grave tone her soaring strain; With man's slow wit, her agile brain And fancies fine? If thus we speak, if Light and Art And Learning lend their banded aid, We will not pause nor be afraid‚Äî We have our Part! II. For the Welsh Review. Another venture on Thought's trackless sea, Another bark launched from our Cambrian shore, And once again the summons comes to me For word of welcome, ofttimes said before. For now our country, which so long was dumb, Speaks clear and loud with no uncertain sound; Done are her silent years, her voice is found, And, Babel-like, the eager accents come. Long since, indeed, the unforgotten tongue, The old fair treasure of our native speech, Sweet as the songs by Cymric voices sung, Was eloquent to move, and strong to teach. Long since, our native learning flowed alone, Seen but of kindred eyes and partial souls; To-day through alien realms its course has gone, And now its broader stream majestic rolls Through English plains, and with it seems to bear The freshness of the untrodden snow-clad hills, A quire of youthful voices keen and fair, The blended accents of unnumbered rills. Go, daring bark, upon the wider stream; Go to what hidden end thy fate doth call; Aiding our country's yet imperfect dream; Go, be thy lot to vanquish or to fall! Thou and thy venturous comrades, small and great, Are freighted with our Cambria's hopes and fears; Thou shalt not miss, whate'er the award of Fate, One favouring hand, at least, one voice which cheers. Sail, with Imperial England, round the earth, Using the lordly tongue which sways the Race; But oh! forget not thou the Cymric grace, The snows, the heaven-kissed summits of thy birth! FROM AN ENGLISH SERMON. From ‚ÄúThe Divine Order,‚Äù a volume of sermons preached by the late Rev. Thomas Jones. More glorious shall the Future be Than the dead Past. For those who scan The chequered page of history, The time-stained palimpsest of Man. 'Tis as the melancholy hum Which sometimes on the musing ear Doth, with vague cries, at nightfall come From the great city festering near. No joyous sound, but sad and stern Echoes of sin and fear and pain, Of eyes that weep and souls that yearn, Of lifelong struggles waged in vain. A dreary record full of Wrong, Triumphant o'er the power of Right; Salvation only for the strong, And brief day swallowed by swift night. Then the blank silence of the grave, Poet and sage and ruler gone; Wisdom and Eloquence past and done, The monarch rotting by the slave. Ay, all are vanished, all is still Where once Life's mingled clamours rose; Devoid of hope, if free from ill, They lie together, friends and foes. Or one faint voice survives to sound Low requiems when the nations die, While from the listening ages round Sobs the thin phantom of a sigh. We pass, we mark with pitying eye Story on story sink in gloom, As one who careless hurries by The moss-grown legends of the tomb. More glorious shall the Future be Than the dead Past. Behold how fair, Lit by the light of Prophecy, A gift the Orient ages bear. The fiend of Ignorance lies dead, Brute aspect and contracted brow; Her twin, Idolatry, has fled, Dark rites, foul spells have vanished now. No more the Tyrant's numbing chains And soul-oppressing prisons are; Nor, with his myriad woes and pains And thunderous roar, the fiend of War. Nor Doubt, half-sister of Despair, Makes Faith grow cold and Godhead dim; Nor shuddering Poverty is there, With fleshless face and shivering limb. But an angelic Sisterhood Reigns in their stead. With smiles of light, Fair Knowledge beckons on to good, And bids us keep and love the Right. Pure as the moon, strong as the sun, And lovely as the opening morn, Faith, from her sepulchre re-born, Links God and suffering Man in one. And Liberty, with radiant face, White-robed, upon the mountain, stands, And waves benign, with outstretched hands, A benediction on the Race. And Peace sits throned, at whose calm feet Asleep the lamb and lion lie, Till, to angelic music sweet, A beam of glory parts the sky. And, from the illumined depths of Space, Peals forth a high Celestial Voice‚Äî God calling a regenerate Race To look upon Him and rejoice. ODE ON THE MARRIAGE OF THE DUKE OF YORK AND PRINCESS VICTORIA MARY OF TECK JULY 6, 1893. Come, let us sing A nuptial song! For now Life's gracious year, 'Scaping the wintry glooms of pain and fear, And tears for young days uncompleted here, Passes the fleeting virgin blooms of Spring To early Summer, and a people's voice Makes ready to rejoice Through all our boundless Empire, far and wide, With gifts and loyal wishes welcoming The Bridegroom and the Bride. No new charm draws The hearts of high and low, but primal, old, Simple as Life, yet like it manifold, This glamour which transmutes our dross to gold, This all-entrancing and compelling cause Which links two separate hearts, two several minds, With golden links, and binds By its own strong indissoluble laws, Closer than any bond of heaven or earth, Two diverse essences imperfect else, In a new mystic Birth. Myriads of hearts to-day Beat fast for Love's approach. In many a home In dewy English parks, 'neath secular trees, The eyes of maids and mothers, which grew wet For that which none forget, Kindle with joy to see the young God come. Myriads of humbler hearths by field or town Are fain of it, and do rejoice with these; Thro' all our greater Britain loyal souls, 'Twixt whom and us the ocean vainly rolls, By hill or lonely plain, or sea-vexed isle, Or where the warm waves kiss the palm-fringed strand, Or silent sombre, listening forests stand, Hear the glad news, and smile, And live their Past anew, and home-ward turn With hearts and souls that yearn, Seeing again their lost youth glorified In Bridegroom and in Bride. Great Heaven! how vast a load of love is here To burden youth and maid; Joyous indeed and blithe, and full of cheer, Yet strong to make afraid. How dense a flight of soaring suffrages Mounts to the sky for these, These young lives, all untried, on whom shall weigh,‚Äî Pray Heaven, on some remote unthought-of day,‚Äî A load of Empire and of care, Well-nigh too great to bear; These young brows, which one day shall be drawn down Beneath the Imperial Crown. Sometimes, sometimes may be, Amid the irksome round of ceremony, Salt airs shall seem to whisper from the sea, And soon the loud imperious ocean-sound Shall drown the courtly voices round, And once again, for the bold sailor's soul, The deep storm-music shall begin to roll, And the stout ship exulting, rise to brave The impending ocean-wave, Steered thro' black night against the invisible surge. Or when unwonted cares of State shall urge, By some remembered tropic isle Again the liquid azure seem to smile, And he, the ennobling toil and peril past, Lie free to rest at last. Sometimes, fair maid, for thee, When the unending pageant tires, Amid the heat, the gems, the glare, The heavy perfumed lifeless air, Some youthful memories yet May make those soft eyes wet, And thou again wilt come to yearn For happy scenes which never shall return, The long-armed oaks, the fawns amid the fern; And dream again a gracious dream Of sweet June twilights on the brimming stream, Or innocent school-feasts, or the boyish quires And ivied church, or thou wilt soothe again Some child's pathetic pain, Till the rapt, musing girl forgets the Queen, And all that since has been. Peace, Love is Lord of all! Nor shall grave thought to-day nor care Stay the gay tide of nuptial song. Peaceful may be their wedded lives, and long, Their fateful voyage fair; Whatever good things Fortune holds in store Be theirs in affluent plenty, more and more; The duteous love of children to assuage The growing ills of Age. Whatever solace wealth and Regal State Can give to lives by Fate made isolate Be theirs, and all-pervading Peace Secure their Realm's increase! Beyond their latest days may our dear England be Mighty by land and Sovereign of the Sea! And since from all men they must live apart, Ah, let them grow together, heart to heart! Tho' the World spread her toils of Pride and Sense, Let not their heedless footsteps fall, But let them dwell in wedded innocence. Treasure thou, Prince, treasure this priceless thing, This home-born blossom of our English Spring. Cling to thy Love, fair girl; be it thy care To shield him from a Court's too perilous air. White lily and white rose, bloom ye together Thro' long unclouded summer weather, Till comes the wintry wind which severs all. Long years, a grateful people's love, Reveres a blameless life, a widowed Throne, Where goodness sits apart, august, alone, And ye on either side, Each nurtured in a tranquil English home, Bridegroom and Bride, Rich in a father's care, a mother's love, Midst homely virtues learned to live and move; The modest state ye know, the healthful sport Which scorns the pomp and glamour of a Court. Still let these wholesome memories come, Still keep through all your years this precious thought: There lives no precept but the eternal ‚ÄúOught.‚Äù The old bad rule of luxury and vice Is lost to-day in generous sacrifice; No Power there is can draw the multitude Save the pure might of Good! Then let us joy, nor all forget England is merry England yet; For Age and Childhood spread the humble feast, Make the poor glad for one bright day at least. Upon a thousand village greens to-day Youth's lightsome feet shall dance and all be gay; From North to South, from East to West, With flags and jewelled fires be burgh and city drest; Let white stars float upon the evening skies, From the high summits let the joy-fires rise; Let the resounding cannon's harmless voice Proclaim to all that all to-day rejoice; Break chimes in spray upon the summer air, Flutter gay ensigns, martial trumpets blare: This is our solemn day of mirth, Let Youth exult and Age o'er all our British earth. The Son of England comes to-day to wed, Heir of her glorious Past, her deathless Dead; Heir to her wider Future yet to be, To her Imperial gains, her Sovereign Fate; Her Lord one day, and Ruler of her will; Yet of a higher name and office still,‚Äî First Citizen of the State! TWO DAYS IN JUNE: 1894. June 23rd. They roused them from their hard-earned sleep, Those humble workers for their bread, And willing, down the terraced steep The dutiful processions sped. Their wives, their children at the door Shouted good-byes with cheerful noise; They watched the fathers with their boys, Nor dreamt that they should come no more. Silent below, the black abyss Yawns for its prey as waits the tomb‚Äî When all are come, Heaven! what is this? This sudden crash of Death and Doom? A blinding flash, a deafening roar, Lives crushed, or torn, or stifled, then Black clouds of smoke, and nothing more Of full three hundred toiling men. June 24th. He left his wife, his home, his all, The chosen ruler of his race, As one who marches forth to fall, The light of Duty on his face. His daughter with her little child Welcomed him on his lonely way; He kissed them both, then sadly smiled: Fate summoned him‚Äîhe might not stay. The fluttering streets, the plaudits loud, The passionate greetings of the crowd, The civic feast, the guarded state, Might drown awhile the voice of Fate. Aside he bade his escort stand, And let the people press his hand; Nearer they draw‚Äîa flash, a start, A dagger stabs him to the heart. A gasp, a pang, a piercing pain, A gush of blood, a choking breath; The surgeon's skill endured in vain, And, ere Love came to tend him, Death. Dark Powers of Evil every where Encompass us in earth and air; Nor there alone, but deadlier roll Deep through each maimed malignant soul. To Pain and Death, though Duty lead, Men's faithful feet shall follow still, Possessed by her imperious creed, And creatures of a Hidden Will. A LAST WILL. I, Francois Fonteney, coming to die, After long life expended in the cure Of suffering men, through that which I have learnt Of healing medicine, do hereby make This my last Will and Testament, and die At peace with God and all except myself, As you shall find hereunder when you read. For always since my first-remembered years Such quenchless thirst for knowledge occupied My soul, that never with the vulgar herd Of full-fed youths, who game and drink and worse, Yet take no shame, I dwelt, but studious days, Through the dead night prolonged, till the cold dawn Found me with fires burnt out. Thus thro' long years Of vigils and a chaste, unsullied youth, I came at last to manhood and the fruit Of full enfranchised life, my boyish thirst To know, unsatisfied still. I found scant time For friendship or for love; yet not the less The irrepressible longing of the youth For hearth and home was mine. One woman only I worshipped from afar, lifting shy eyes That scarcely dared to love. I hardly think She knew that she was loved, so shrunk my soul From utterance, tho' I worshipped her indeed. And when she chose her mate, I schooled my heart With doubly jealous care. No spoken word Nor look betrayed me; tho' full well I know What little tell-tale signs reveal the god To the keen sight of maids. Yet tho' I loved I think she never knew it, maid or wife. But friendship for her and her husband cheered My solitary hours. His work it was To minister to souls diseased, as mine To bodily ills. So day by happy day We lived in union, soul with kindred soul Working in harmony, and Love, unseen, Binding three lives in one. The friend-less youth, Friendless no longer, up the rugged path Of knowledge with swift paces climbed, nor ceased Till the rough path grew smoother, and success Was his and modest wealth; but still he kept His boyish friendship and his eager thirst For knowledge. Wellnigh thirty years have fled Since those bright days, and still in age I keep Their memory undimmed‚Äîthe blame-less life, Which strove for God; the young and gracious woman; With pure affection beaming from her eyes‚Äî Wife, mother, friend‚Äîa Trinity of love And beauty, vanished long, deceased and dead! What piteous tale is mine? Think ye I fell Into the Tempter's net, which your own youth, Past now, my children, spread for you in vain? The base, disloyal wickedness which wrecks A stainless woman's troth, a husband's honour, The happiness of children, hearth, and home, For one base appetite, when to succeed Is treachery and dishonour; the vile wrong Which in our splendid sinful sister France Pollutes a nation's fealty, yet inspires, As from the dung-heap springs the perfumed rose, A myriad hectic life-tales fancy bred? Nay, nay; no thought of this was mine, nor peril, I loved them both too well, even in thought To sully those I loved, and most of all I loved my art, and gave my soul to it; My noble art, which stays the power of Pain And Death, engrossed my mind, my heart, my soul, My toiling days, my studious nights, and left me Virgin in act and thought. Ah, happy days Of honest labour, with their added sum Of knowledge hour by hour! I could not fall From such high conversation as they fall Into black nothingness of Faith and God, Whom narrower knowledge and the purblind quest Of lens and scalpel blind to the Divine; I kept my faith undimmed. Love day by day, A good man's words, and more, a good man's life, Expended on compassion, shielded me Till prosperous manhood crowned my studious youth. Ah, happy, fleeting days! too fair to last; For soon a gradual shadow settled down On that bright home. The gracious mother came To grow a little graver, then to droop With some immedicable ill. Long months I strove to save her, pitying her pain And his who loved her; but I strove in vain, For day by day she suffered, every day Her pitiful weakness grew. I searched the lore Of healing far and wide; I did consult The foremost teachers of my art in vain; For still the quick, sharp stab around the heart, The difficult, laboured breath grew worse, and I Knew myself impotent to save or aid, For all my useless skill; while he, her husband, Was half distraught. So passed the unhappy days, The hopeless days, till last the labouring heart Beat slow and slower yet, and then stood still. Shall I forget the blank, the nothingness, Which, when her life was done, and the white corpse Lay in its shroud, came on that wretched house, The dull, deep pain; till on the weary sense There dawned again the old desire to know The unsatisfied, quenchless thirst? If I might solve The secret of her ill, and aid a little The suffering Race of men! One rapid stroke Of the keen knife might in a moment bare The secret, and enlarge the bounds of knowledge! A hundred times my hand had done this thing, Hardened by use; but how to violate That pure, cold calm? Surely 'twere sacrilege! And well I knew my friend who worshipped her Would shudder at the thought. Yet still it came; The o'ermastering thought oppressed me day and night, The inarticulate voice unceasing called, Till came the last sad day when she was laid Within her narrow bed, and he and I Followed and wept together, and awhile The muttering voice was hushed, and I had peace. But when I left the house of grief, and night Had fallen, through the darkling hours the thought And voice renewed themselves, and seemed to fill My brain, and arm my hand, and urge my feet, Bearing some flickering lantern thro' the gloom, Scarce conscious that I went, or with what end, Whither I knew not, till the midnight hour Tolled from the darkness downward, and behold! The pile of heaped-up mould still undisturbed, Beside the new-made grave, by which that day I stood and wept, and strewn around it still The spade, the mattock‚Äîall the dreadful tools Which render earth to earth. Then as mused, As one who part mislays the thread of thought, Forgetting why I came, the same cold voice In tones of thunder bade me tread the path Of Duty, sweeping all aside but this‚Äî Love, friendship‚Äîall but this. ‚ÄúDo this, and see What gain of knowledge for our hapless race Awaits thee. This poor vesture of decay, Which, like the chrysalis, the ascending soul Leaves with its load of pain; this thou hast pierced So oft for others, pierce once more, and know The secret which thy skill suspects lies hid Beyond that clay-cold flesh.‚Äù Then with a cry I seized the spade and leapt into the grave, And, delving, in a frenzy, flung aside The new-fallen mould, till with a groaning sound I struck the coffin lid, and prised away The nails with bleeding hands, scarce owning yet What thing it was I would. But when I saw By my dim lantern's light the pale, cold face I loved and lost, a sudden trembling shook My limbs and stayed my hand and froze my blood, So fair she seemed and pure, wrapt in her shroud And decked with drooping lilies. Then I braced My nerves, determined now to do the deed, And carefully with reverent hand disclosed That wasted bosom. But before I drew The thin, keen blade, and while I paused in doubt, With paralysed will, loathing to violate The sanctity of Death, a crushing blow Assailed me from above, and, ere I turned, Another, and I saw in the dim light The fierce, distracted visage of my friend, Frenzied with grief. Then, knowing 'twas in vain To appease his fury, staggering to the spade, I struck him with it once, in hope to stun him And fly, but on his temple the sharp edge Descending crushed his brain, and he fell dead Upon his dead wife's grave. Then when I saw The wound, and knew my hapless hands' mischance, I swooned beside the dead. But when at length My life returned, 'twas dead of night; no sound Awoke the dreadful silence where they lay, Two corpses side by side. The lamp still burned Faint with a dying flame. There lay my friend, And I, his murderer, gazed on him. There lay The woman of my blameless love, and I Bent o'er her in her shroud. Then rose again The half-dead love of life, and bade me take Some swift resolve. I smoothed the stiffening limbs Of him I slew, and where his wife had lain Laid him at rest, and closed the coffinlid, And piled the mould again as 'twas before And levelled it, and as the feeble light Died, 'mid the pitchy darkness stooped and took The shrouded corpse of her I loved, and bore her‚Äî Thankful to Heaven I could not see her face‚Äî Slowly with faltering paces to my home. Ah me, how light she was‚Äîthe wasted form Which in my arms I bore! I seemed to move In some weird dream, as thro' the little town, Where no light burned, I stole. No horror now Assailed me, knowing I was innocent Of what had been, in will if not in act, And that the wish to know and aid the Race Alone‚Äînought else‚Äîimpelled me. All the way I went came no belated wayfarer, For from the rayless heavens dense sheets of rain Fell, and a great wind rising and the roll Of crashing thunder hindered sight and sound, As, by the lurid lightning-flashes led, Thro' the dark ways I bore the shrouded dead. Till when I gained my home (so like to this It well might be the same) I struck a light Softly, and to the lonely vault below Bore the dear corpse, and then the precious gain For which I dared so much was mine. I breathed A prayer, and three times essayed to commence The task I loathed; but long time the skilled hand Which duty nerved, trembling, refused to hold The keen, dividing blade. At last I braced My desperate will, and bared with one swift stroke The painless heart, and soon the mystery Of all the evil and its cure was mine, And power to heal and triumph over Pain And Death; and suddenly my o'er-wrought soul Was filled with such consuming ecstasy As wellnigh blotted out the night's sad work And that which I did then. Last, with dim eyes I toiled the livelong night and hollowed out A narrow grave. There, wrapt within her shroud, With one sad, reverent kiss‚Äîthe first and last‚Äî Upon her clay-coll brow, I laid my love‚Äî ('Tis wellnigh thirty years since that dread night)‚Äî I laid my love at rest. There she lies still. I think I hardly knew a sense of grief Nor fear, when with the noon my weary eyes Woke to another day. The furious storm Blotted the trampling footmarks from the mould Around the grave, and all the tell-tale signs Of that fierce struggle. It was noised abroad How the slain man who lay for ever still By his own church, distraught with grief and pain, Had flung his life away. No faintest trace They found of him, and then the piteous tale Faded from out the careless minds of men. But their two orphaned infants, girl and boy‚Äî Scarce older than yourselves‚ÄîI took awhile To my own home, and cherished as my own, And loved as I love you (you, too, have lost A mother, if a father you have still, And are part orphans); and I think they loved me, And love me still. But now the flying years Have left them man and woman, as are ye, And brought new precious cares to fill their hearts, As they have yours. My life since that sad night Seemed not unhappy. I have reaped the fruit Of that successful quest. Power and fame And wealth are mine; and you have shared with me All that I had to give. But more than all I prize, and plead for pardon of my wrong, The thousands whom my skill, gained at what price You know, has cured, and shall while life's slow wain Groans on its painful way. I had no thought In life but this; and yet a sudden impulse, The mischance of a moment, this has left me A middle-age of sorrow, when the man, All loved and honoured, loathed himself in pain, And healing others, might not heal the wound Hid deep within his breast. Surely, my children, You will not spurn me when you read, nor curse me Whatever comes to light? I gave you love‚Äî A father's love‚Äîand now I leave to you All my skill earned‚Äîlands, houses, riches; all That makes life smooth. But I am not your father. Your father lies slain in your mother's grave; She in the dark vault here. I conjure you, Bury her with her husband. I rejoice You are not children now, but man and woman, Grown sadly wise and tolerant of ill, Knowing this tangled world and all its sin. So may you pardon unintended wrong, Since God, who knows all, pardons, as I hope, And he, and she. I pray you let her lie Beside her love; and me, too, of your pity, Not with them, yet not far! AN ODE RECITED AT THE NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, JULY 11, 1894. Six centuries ago Llywelyn fell, And with him Wales, and the strong Norman power‚Äî Stern Fortune, was it well?‚Äî Prevailed at last, and for the dauntless dead, And that beloved dishonoured head, New-born within a neighbouring tower, There came a little child, sprung from another race‚Äî A kingly child, foredoomed by cruel Fate, Came to replace the unforgotten Great, And was our Prince in name. Then the fierce flood of patriot song, Which from each heaven-kist hill And deep-set vale rolled downward loud and strong, Crept longtime low and still; The vanquished land kept silence, and no more The bard's keen voice might soar, Nor the old harp of Wales be swept again; Of warfare would they sing, and rude alarms, The clash of swords, the clang of arms, Their souls were tuned to no serener strain. Slow centuries crept by, And left our Wales asleep. A peace which was not peace Bound her in slumbers deep. Our Britain's triumphs over foreign foes, Our Britain's civil strifes and frequent woes, Scarce stirred her torpid life. Asleep she lay long time, remote, forlorn, Till the New Day was born. But deep within her loyal soul The steadfast brooding Cymric nature yet, Too faithful to forget, Felt the old hidden currents roll: The treasure of her native tongue; The secret of her old harmonious rhyme; The measures by her dim forefathers sung; The fealty to the Past, stronger with time;‚Äî These filled the nation's heart, And nerved her for her part. Nor wholly silent was the voice of Song, Thro' those mute ages long, Till the dark secular night-clouds passed away, And on our Wales, still living, broke the Day. Ay, now indeed 'tis Day! Not full Noon yet, but Dawn! And from her scarce awakened gaze, away The curtains of the nation's soul are drawn; Above the hill-tops mounts the rising sun, The Night of Ignorance is done; This very year, reared by devoted hands, Than visible fanes more bright, A home of Knowledge and of Light Our immaterial new-built Temple stands. Forget not, thou, dear land, those cold or failing hands! And still as of old time The bardic Congress meets for rhyme and song. But who comes here, a long-expected guest, After those silent centuries long? A Prince of Wales once more, As in those unforgotten days of yore, Comes where Canarvon sits on Menai's sounding shore; And by him, with sweet smile and gaze serene, The fairest mother Cymric eyes have seen; And young lives, too, in whom we joy to trace Their mother's Royal grace. Great Empire of our Britain, that hast been Longer than Greece, and wider art than Rome, After six hundred years the Prince of Wales comes home! Where could our Prince more fitly see Our new recovered Unity Than in this ancient Session of our Race, Which always, through the wintry centuries, When else our Cymric genius slept, Some sacred spark has kept To light the smouldering fires to life again? Here, where all dissonant sounds are hushed and dumb, And a deep peace embraces all, 'Tis well that he should come, And mark the quaint penillion rise and fall; The tuneful thunder of the emulous quires; And hear the ancient tongue which still inspires Quick-kindling bardic fires; And see a myriad peasant faces stirred By soaring note or eloquent word; The white-robed girlish singers fair; The sheathed swords crossed above the Bardic Chair; And that grave innocent Druidic rite Done ‚Äúin the eye of Light.‚Äù Here, musing deep, our minds shall pause to trace The age-long story which has flowered to-day, The record of the undying Cymric Race; Our Britain grown so great By long decrees of Fate; The unchanged poetic flame, In form and tongue the same With that which lit of old unnumbered lives; And pondering well the Past, rejoicing say, ‚ÄúWhat the first Edward quenched, the Seventh revives;‚Äù And from that primal history Those fateful words recall, The prophecy fulfilled from ancient days: ‚ÄúThough they shall lose their old ancestral land Save wild Wales only; in the ancient tongue Their Maker they shall praise,‚Äù And, doing this, shall stand and shall not fall! IDYLLS AND LYRICS. MORNING SONG. Awake, arise! Day's shining eyes Open unclouded to the waking skies; Night and the hosts of Sleep, Dispersed, defeated, creep To their Leth√¶an dens and sunless caverns deep. Hark! with the day His roundelay Each brave bird sings, and speeds away; Aloft, on circling wings, The mounting skylark sings, A denizen of air, scorning terrestrial things. Arise, awake! And, singing, make Thy morning orisons for Love's sweet sake. Awake, awake, arise! Keep the cerulean skies Reflected in the faithful azure of thine eyes. IN THE BAPTISTERY. In Pisa once, within the Baptistery I well remember, the astonished ear Took sounds too sweet for earth. For as we stood Beneath the fretted ambit of the dome The poor guide lifted a worn voice, not sweet, But skilled to evoke the subtle harmonies Which lurked in those dim heights; a common voice And earthy as the accents, coarse and dull, Of some street singer at a tavern door, Frighting the midnight street; some hackneyed phrase Stolen from the Missal-book, so poor and flat We fain had silenced it. But hark! but hark! Ere it is done what heavenly harmonies Flout those poor tones of earth. The ambient air Seems filled with voices, voices every-where, Of some angelic choir, which swell, which beat, Reverberating; circling waves of sound, Now single, doubled now, and resonant And grown together, and interlaced and lost In some unearthly sweetness mystical, Till all the enchanted vault is charged with joy, As when of old, hid on their perilous isle, The lurking Sirens drew the listening crews; Or as the chanting quires which soar and fall In hoary fanes; or the a√´rial flights Of the angelic host whose heavenly tones The rapt Cecilia heard; or those white ranks Of gold-haired Seraphs, chanting row on row, With viol and voice and trump, the painter saw And filled with high-pitched music for all time Though no sound come. Anon the circling tides, Ebbing and flowing through the stately round Of that great dome, are driven back, wave on wave, High, repercussive, till they sink and die, Like fairy ripples of a summer sea, In sweetness, and transform themselves and flow In some low gracious melody which sighs, Fainter and fainter, to its perfect close,‚Äî As 'twere the soaring, rapt, angelic choir, Which vanished in heaven's vault and left earth dumb Of music, first the uplifted, pealing, high Archangels' trumpets, then the chanting saints, And then the faint child-angels' voices last. MELIORA. The feeble folk wane through the ages, and careless the Mighty ones smite them; Who is there that shall avenge the shedding of innocent blood? Over the earth and the sea, the spoiler and slayer triumph, Till the low sobs grow to a shriek, and the tears to a flood. Careless are they, the strong, secure of the fathomless Future; As it has been shall it be even to the pitiless end. In their dens, by the hills, or the sea, long ages the bickering cave-men, Armed with their sharpened flints, rob and ravish and slay; The smoke of the Aztec victims steams up from the Mexican altars, And the quivering heart is torn by the priests from the living breast; The bearded Assyrian treads on the necks of the vanquished foemen; The shafts from the chariot pierce the huddled wretches who fly. On the tombs of the Nile's grave lords still marches the doleful procession‚Äî The captives go forth to swift death or the lifelong doom of the slave. Laurel-crowned, up the Capitol's steep the heavy-eyed C√¶sar advances; Splendid the triumph rolls by, with the fettered captives behind; The half-famished lions leap forth on the sands of the bloody arena, And for ages no pitying thrill touches those merciless hearts. Through all time under African skies, the tyrant or slaver oppresses; The red man slays and is slain on the limitless plains of the West; Through the weary suffering Past, far and wide, by land and o'er ocean, The feeble are trampled down, and only the mighty are blest. Comes there no end of these things? shall men murder and ravage for ever? Shall not a mightier hand give to the desolate Peace? And thou, my Britain, unconquered, untrod by the foot of the foeman, Hast thou deep Peace indeed in thy borders, or imminent strife? Thou who slayest the savage with bolts from thy murderous death-dealing engines, And lettest thy children starve in the midst of plenty around, Though to-day thou seemest at rest, shalt thou scorn the lesson of ages, Singing thoughtless p√¶ans of Peace in a time wherein no Peace is? When the graves of the slain lie thick, Lorraine, on thy vine-covered hillsides, And the New World echoes and throbs with the stress of a fratricide strife; When the cry of the tortured for Christ rises up from ravaged Armenia, And the murdered myriads appeal from the fiendish Moslem in vain; Maidens outraged, and teeming mothers cut open, the innocent children Dashed to death on the stones of the street, or spared for a crueller lust, While strong Europe, too selfish to aid, is wrecked by her useless battalions, And the people, affrighted, shrink back from the thought of the terrors to be; When fiends plot together in secret, driven mad by unreasoning hatred, Flinging death and destruction unmoved, though 'tis only the innocent bleed, And groans of the strong men rise, who fain would labour, but may not, While their pale-faced children starve or rot in their feverish dens;‚Äî What heart has a man to tell of an infinite ruth and pity, Whose ears are filled with the noise of the woes and the sorrows around? Shall the common lot take thee too, O dear land, the doom of the feeble, When the strength that was thine is spent, and the foemen beleaguer thee sore? Nay; destroy not the reckless savage, who flings his rude manhood against thee, Whom thy pitiless engines mow down as a mower the grass of the field. But keep thou thy Power unassailed, and be just and fear not the future; With equal and merciful laws make thou thy wide Empire, rejoice! Be to thy children a Mother, be they as brother to brother, Acting the precept divine which was taught by thy Teacher and Lord; Let thy strong sons raise up thy weak, through a Christ-like strength of compassion, Bearing each other's burdens, and lightening each other's woes; Let not the State any more turn with merciless aspect averted From the sight of the people's pain, unheeding their pitiful cry. Scorn thou the pedants who prate of dead laws stern and unbending, Based only on selfish instincts, and spurning the General Good, Knowing one limit alone to the Commonwealth's province of mercy‚Äî That no action of all shall mar the life-giving effort of each. Let thy Empire of self-governed men prove how weak is the arm of the despot, How mighty the sum of the strength of myriads obeying the law. Save thou the weak from themselves when strong temptations assail them, The curses of Greed and of Sloth, the Demons of Lust and of Drink. By patient toil without price, raise thou in the hearts of the lowly The white bloom of knowledge, to swell to wisdom's ineffable fruit. Destroy not the humble home, when the strength of the worker has vanished, And the young have gone from the nest, and the cottage is silent and still. Let the State, with wise providence, aid the faithful servants of labour To an honest wage for their toil, and relief from the sorrows of age. Raise the myriads of poor and cast-down from the sloughs where to-day they languish, Teach them the civic sense, their duty to man and to God. Join thou and thy children your strength, till the nations learn the unreason, The folly, the mischief, the crime of the murderous evils of war; Let a stronger league of Peace dispel the jealous suspicions, The angers, the senseless hates, which divide and distract men to-day, Till the Voice of Justice is heard, August, Inviolate, Awful, Where now are the myriad cries of causeless passion and hate; Then let the Judge ascend to His Throne, and the weak and the strong be judged. FROM A RUINED TOWER. The eyes of dreaming Fancy fall On ivied tower and moss-grown wall, And straightway o'er the unlovely Past The glamour of Romance is cast. Forth from the high portcullised gate The knights and damsels ride in state, The white plumes nod, the rich robes gleam, Mail flashes like a sunlit stream. And all that sordid story mean, The sin, the suffering that have been, The lifelong dungeons dark and foul, The tortured limbs, the famished soul, Fade from the self-deluded mind, And eyes by wayward Fancy blind, Till of the crime, the blood, the pain, No faintest memories remain. Ah! wayward Fancy, turn from these Fond dreams and bootless fantasies; Upon the living, not the dead, Are golden rays of noontide shed. The lives to-day of small and great March on ward to a nobler fate; Hopes higher, darker fears they hold, Than those ignoble days of old. The Present's wider, fuller life, Its loftier aims, its keener strife, Can deeper touch the yearning heart To higher song and truer art. And fairer still and nobler far The glimpses of the Future are: The race transfigured, wrong redressed, Creation tending towards the Best. And queenly Knowledge, thron√®d fair, Mistress alike of Earth and Air, Crowned with a diadem of Peace, Watches her boundless realms increase. Turn, wayward Fancy, turn thine eye From these false tales of chivalry; The Night is past, the Day begun, Salute, acclaim the ascending Sun. A PLEA FOR THE CHILDREN. Shall woman's pitying love Its object seek in vain? Comes there to-day our hearts to move No hopeless, innocent pain? The dull world speeds on its unbending course‚Äî No law there seems but Force!‚Äî And those whose tender hearts would seek To aid the helpless weak, Too oft, with folded hands, sit impotent Waiting the dark event. So loud the doubting voices are, We scarce may stir at all, Though at the shock of ruthless war The young battalions fall! Over all lands in vain The toiling worker's pain Speaks, with a terrible voice unheard, Its awful Sibylline word! Hardly we dare assuage The ever-growing ills of Age, Who, knowing how the lifelong sufferers live, Know, too, how hard the task to wisely give. The homes of healing languish for the gold The rich, perplexed, withhold: Since hardly may our minds discern the clue To separate the false need from the true‚Äî So hard to tell if that we strive to do Make not the tangle worse, And bring, indeed, no blessing, but a curse! One cause there is, indeed‚Äî Alas for all the Christian centuries!‚Äî Calls clear from childish lives that bleed With daily miseries. Within a thousand homeless homes to-day The sot, the savage, bear remorseless sway‚Äî Vile souls, and hearts of stone! With none to heed the helpless children moan‚Äî Starved, beaten, prisoned, drugged, tormented, slain: In life a burden, but in death a gain! Shall these still suffer? Shall the State's tired arm, Too slow to save from harm, Its dim eye, by a thousand cares, grown blind, No willing helpers find? These little ones! Shall they unaided pine? Who, fresh from the creative Hand Divine, Bring to our sad, laborious earth Bright memories of their birth! Who 'neath a happier, juster fate May give strong, willing workers to the State! Here no doubt comes; here is our duty plain: Soothe, tender women, soothe their hopeless pain! And trample, with a righteous anger strong, This thrice accurs√®d wrong! AD ANIMAM. Therefore I said unto my Soul, ‚ÄúRejoice, Oh Soul, be comforted, for thou long time Hast fared upon the snow-clad heights, and breathed The icy mountain air, and watched the dawn Steal upward from the Eastern rim, and marked The silver shafts transmuted into gold By the uprushing Sun, and oft alone, Sole, unattended, save of thine own strength, Above the slumbering cities seen the throngs Wake the hushed streets, and heard the warring sounds Of joy and sorrow, birth and death, arise, Blent in the sweet sad symphony of Life, And the tired world revive. And thou hast smiled, Flouting the aimless struggle from afar On thy untrodden height, the stress, the toil, And trouble of the Race; dwelling apart From wars and tribulations, and the clash And jangle of opposing schools, convinced That all alike were vain, and mocking all. ‚ÄúNor hast thou bowed thee with hysteric zeal At shrines which were not Reason's, casting down The birthright of thy freedom and the gains Of Man's long upward struggle, and the hope Of his high-soaring Future, in the mire At the priest's bidding, while the blinding fumes Of the swung censers and the magic spell Of Art and Music chained thee, eye and ear. But standing cold, aloof, disdain'dst to kneel Where the throng knelt, incredulous, alone. ‚ÄúNor hast thou wallowed in the sensual sty, Nor known the fetters Sloth and Dalliance Bind round the nascent life, the mists of sense Quenching Youth's pure white fire; but by thy cell And midnight lamp, Divine Philosophy Sate grave, with clear cold eyes; and wholesome toil Engrossed thy days and purged thee of all stain Of sin, till thou, to godlike stature grown, Didst spurn the grosser Earth. Therefore, oh Soul, Rejoice, and be thou glad.‚Äù But not a word Of answer came, but through the formless void, Beyond the circuits of the faintest stars, A thin wail, like the melancholy wind Among the high-set pines or caverned rocks, Hopeless, revoluble, reverberant, And deepening to a groan, which seemed to say, ‚ÄúOh, self-deceived, self-righteous, nothing worth, And self-betrayed! Oh, fool! in vain! in vain!‚Äù A MODERN IDYLL. I. Crowning the sapphire of our Southern sea The white cliffs gleam. Above, the dark pines rise From purple heather. The clear autumn sky Bears white winged cloudlets, drifting leisurely Across the azure. A caressing breeze Breathes upon sea and sky, and wakes the deep To rippling laughter. All is calm and peace. Calm the clear evening of untroubled lives, As if no trumpet-blast of woe and pain Might wake their slumbering depths and wreck their peace; And calm the aspect of the smiling sea, As if no tempest ever lashed the surge To thunder in the ocean caves, nor dashed Strong ships to ruin, nor sowed the rocky walls With undistinguished corpses of the dead. Here on a golden August eve of old Two score of years ago, on that calm sea, Churning the slumbering waters into foam, A long black hull, trailing a cloud of smoke, Throbbed swiftly to the West. 'Twas time of war, And this a troopship from the neighbouring port Laden with youthful lives, for whom swift Fate Had come to change the frivolous daily round Of strenuous idleness, the sloth, the rust Of long ignoble peace for the wild joy Of battle, the tame fields of common flowers For the red rose of perilous enterprise Which wounds the hand the grasps it. The great ship The great ship Sped with its thousand hopes, its diverse fates Of fame and golden ease, of death and pain, The white thread with the black, the enchanted skein Which weaves the mystic vesture of our lives. There in a high cliff-garden, mute, alone, A young girl sat, her head upon her hand; Her fair hair hid her brow, her cheek was pale. Shyly, she waved her handkerchief, then flushed, Marking an answering signal from the deck, ‚ÄúFarewell, dear heart, farewell.‚Äù Then the ship passed, Then the ship passed, But still she watched. At last the western cape Shut out the view, and then she dropped her eyes, Sobbing; and on the unbounded ocean plains And on the high-set downs and misty leas, And painted glories of the autumnal flowers, Smooth laurel and the feathery tamarisk, The swift gloom fell, and left her weeping there. Then when the twilight fell, and a cool breeze Breathed from the sea, shivering, but not with cold, She rose, a tall young figure, lithe and slim, Crowned with the crown of youth, and health and grace And innocence; and to the new-lit house She stole, and softly up the noiseless stair Sped to her maiden chamber; knelt awhile In speechless prayer, then bathing her sad eyes To hide the tell-tale tears, in virgin white, Lit by one blushing rose, descended slow To where the din, confused, of eager talk Burst from the opened door; and, scarce perceived, Passed like a breathing statue, and feigned to smile And seemed to share the polished trivial themes Of books and pictures, plays and politics; And, always smiling, listened; till the talk Turned to the war and its quick coming ills, And, since none knew her secret, all the fears Of trouble, the strong forces of the foe, The dread of coming pestilence, the strength Of the great fortress, all the miseries Of frozen winter on the unsheltered heights‚Äî A hundred presages of ill. At last One, turning to her, marked her ashy face, Pale lips, and closing eyes, as, faint and white, She sank upon her chair. Soon with forced smiles And slow-reviving pulse, she rose and went, Vowing 'twas nothing but the heat, the glare Of the long cloudless day, and, scorning aid, Swept slowly to her room, and there within The locked door swooned, and fell prone on her bed, And lay long time unconscious; then again Revived, but from her mother's soothing hand And kiss and tender words of comfort shrank, Locking her fateful secret in her heart. Sweet Amy Howard, opening like a rose In youth's enchanted air, to the gay town Came forty Mays ago, and there she took, The darling of an old patrician home, Whatever innocent pleasure might await The happy young. The Court's high pageantries Opened swift doors to her. The snowy plumes Crowning the girlish head, the glittering gems, The flowers, the costly robes, the stately trains; Tragedy's cleansing tears: the singer's voice Thrilling the stately throng, the streets aglow With gliding lights, the whirling dances sweet Fainting with dawn, the brief hushed hours of rest, And happy dreams; the ambling cavalcade Through the brisk morn beneath the scented limes; The vernal harvest of the fictive hand On canvas or in stone; the clustering blooms In thronged marquees; the martial melodies, Rising and falling 'mid the courtly crowd On smooth pleached lawns; the flower-hung barges, moored On the cool stream to watch the flashing oars Through sweet June days; the sheen of straining limbs Flashing like lightning by; the rippling flow Of youthful laughter, when the rich and fair Met with each joyous day;‚Äîall these were hers One summer long ago. And then the dream Faded in grosser day, and that clear sky Was veiled with cloud, and on that youthful life There passed the first grey shadow of the Unknown. For that strong primal passion which inspired Man's voice when Time was young‚Äîin the old East, Beneath the desert stars, old Greece, old Rome, As now in populous cities, North and South, In all the countryside, by hill and dale, In this grey teeming London of our love,‚Äî Had swept her chords of life and played on them The old mysterious music, blinding sweet, Which takes young hearts; the melody of Pan Which floods the listening soul, and leaves it deaf Thenceforth to lower tones. This taking her, Silenced the strains of mirth, and turned the girl To woman, though the face and form were young‚Äî A woman knowing care. But he to whom she gave her girlish heart Was worthy of her‚Äîa young soldier bold, Careless and pleasure-loving, yet untouched By grosser sense; the scion of a house High born, yet unennobled as the use Of rural England is, whereon the load Of long-inherited burdens bears so hard, That while the eldest born alone is set In lifelong ease, the rest the happier lot Of Labour takes, and by the sword, the pen, Or ventures of the mart, they gain with toil What the wise law denies them. So it came That this young soldier, knowing well what need Constrained him, to his father's counsels sage, That he should only mate with hoarded gold (Since not as yet he knew the power of love), Consented, and among the joyous throng Fluttered long time a careless butterfly, Yet lighted on no bloom. Till one blest night Of summer, 'mid the flower-decked dance, he saw, Herself the fairest flower, a girlish form, Lithe, clad in virgin white, with eyes of blue, Sweep by him, and their glances met, and then No longer might his careless fancy roam To others, nor the maiden keep her troth Unplighted more, so strong an influence Bound each to each, its name, Requited Love. So through the flying summer days and nights They met and grew together, till their souls, Fused in one common essence, lived no more Their separate lives; with vows unuttered yet, Deep graven on their hearts, but since the lack Of riches vexed them, never by the lips A word of love was spoken, yet no less Their troth was plighted by a thousand signs And hidden bonds. Amid the careless crowd Careless they moved, nor might the Argus eyes Of women trace their secret, yet they knew Themselves fast bound, though seeming to be free. Then one day on those happy fateful days, Careless no longer, rose a sudden storm Out of the distant East, the trump of war Breaking the age-long peace. A thousand homes In happy rural England heard the sound, And shivered for the dear ones of their love‚Äî Sons, brothers, lovers. All the lightsome thoughts Of the old joyous life vanished and gone; Fled were the careless hours, the music mute, The feasts, the dances done. But ere it came The soldier's ardent heart broke forth in words Which spoke his love. What answer could she make, Who knew it long ago? Her heart was his, And had been from the first. So these young lives Were plighted each to each, and 'mid the chill Of parting and impending trouble glowed With that fine inner light which doth illume Those happier souls which 'mid life's gathered clouds Find their long missing and divided selves And grow complete. What was to them the gloom Of swift descending night which hid the East, The crash of nations, hurled together and wrecked In deadly fight? Amid the storm, the frown Of that embattled sky, one little ray, One little golden glory of the heavens, The secret knowledge of their mutual love, Crowned them with halcyon calm, like that which lies Deep in the heart of the vexed hurricane. So the swift days fled on. Dark and more dark The storm-cloud lowered; louder and yet more loud The thunder roll of war. At last it came, The voice of Fate, and he who heard with joy The order that he longed for, which should bring The chance of Fame and, higher, dearer far, The voice of Duty, calling him to spend His life for England, took a bold resolve And told his dear. He dared not face as yet His father's baffled hopes, which looked for gold To build the shattered fortunes of his house, Nor leave his love unplighted, for whose hand A score of suitors pleaded. So at last He prayed his love, if only ere they went, They should be wed in secret. Long the maid Doubted, for though she lived her life alone, She would not wed another, and her heart Abhorred concealment. Last, in trustfulness And pure, ungrudging love, she put aside Her maiden fears, and then one morn they stole To some near church, and there, with none of kin As witness of the rite, half blind with tears, Yet all in love, she heard the priest pronounce The solemn words which bound their lives in one; And at the porch, parting with one long kiss, They went their ways, and all was as before To outward eyes, though a deep sense of change Had passed upon their lives, transmuting all‚Äî The young man, graver from his doubled life; The wedded maid, a bride, but not a wife. Nor met they more. She to her father's house Went by the Southern sea; he presently Whither his duty called him, till that eve When his stout ship passed to the West, and left, On that high cliff, his maiden wife alone. II. The swift days fled, the earlier autumn waned To later, when the harvest fields grew bare And the year past its prime. On that young heart Fell an autumnal sadness, brooding deep Upon her day and night. Her cheek grew pale, While, shrinking from the careless joys which once Allured, in silent musings she would spend Her recluse days. Only her mother's voice She loved, and she who marked her day by day Fading, grew anxious for her, questioning What thing had been, if haply she might find Some solace for her pain. But not a word Her shy soul dared to speak; for day by day She scanned the journals, but no news would come Save vague reports alone. At last they told How, sudden from the City of the Turk, The great Armada sailed, and then the news How, after forty years of peace, once more Climbing the volleying hillsides from the vines, Our England's columns charged the guns and drove The enemy in flight. Her heart stood still, Reading the fateful list of those who fell Wounded or slain. But the reviving hope, The vivid glow of undefeated youth Flushed her pale cheek; for not 'mid these sad lists Found she the one dear name, but ranged with theirs Whom for sheer daring with the coveted Cross The General rewarded. He had borne The colours up the hill, braving the fire Of half a hundred guns, when others fell, 'Scaping without a wound. 'Twas he whose hand Shot the tall Russian dead, whose lifted sword Had cut the Ensign down. 'Twas he who nursed The wounded lad to life. Then her fond heart, A little chilled by bloodshed, flushed with pride For him who was her husband, and that night The old fire lit her cheek, her eyes, and gave New spirit to her voice, till as of yore She seemed again the bright and joyous girl Who in high summer, scarce three months ago, Lit the old home with innocent mirth and song Uncaring, and her mother's heart was glad. But when the days grew short, and the spent year Was dying fast, came news of dull delays And how the tide of war, leaving the plains And hard-won heights, broke in a surge of blood Round the beleaguered fortress. Then, when now The thick fogs hid the sea and blurred the land In dull November, came the fateful tale Of furious storms, driving to wreck the ships Laden with food and shelter, stubborn fight Fought through the mist, each man for his own hand, ‚ÄúThe soldiers' battle,‚Äù and her heart stood still, Fearing the voice of Fate. But though once more, Amid the dreadful sum of blood and death, Came news that he was safe, the gathering sum Of daily growing miseries, want and cold, Disease and hunger, vexed her, till the girl Could bear no more suspense, nor anxious care, Nor longer sit in idle luxury, While he perhaps lay dying, calling for her To soothe his pain. This thought, recurring still, Tormented her long time; till at the last, When every journal told its harrowing tale Of suffering, she took a stern resolve: She bared to those she loved her secret grief, And prayed consent to go where she might gain To tend her husband. Not her father's voice Of prudent counsel, nor her mother's love, Nor any maiden dread of war and pain Or danger moved her. When they bade her dream No longer of her madness, she locked fast Her purpose in her breast. And one sad morn, Before the loitering dawn she stole away, Leaving with tears her childhood's cherished home, The parents of her love, her girlish friends, White bed and dainty room, her books, her flowers‚Äî All things that made life sweet; passed to the town, Taking her little store of gems and gold, And setting on her pillow a brief note: ‚ÄúForgive me, mother. Duty bids me go. My place is with my husband. He has need Of tender care, and I will seek him out If he still lives. Fear not for me; I go Hoping to join the noble new-formed band Of ministering women. If my skill Is wanting now, yet I may gain in time To help him or his comrades, whom sad Fate Condemns to pain. Fear not, 'tis better so; I should go mad to sit at home and think That we should meet no more. But now I know, So sure a presage occupies my mind, That he shall owe to me returning life And health; no more I know, nor seek to know, But so I gain to save him, all is well.‚Äù So ere the wintry day began to close In dreary twilight, to the gloomy town‚Äî Not the gay town of summer past and gone, But dark with choking mists‚Äîshe passed, and there Besought the gracious women who went forth To that new work of mercy, strange to them, Familiar now, if only she might share Their blessed task, and with the strength of love Grown eloquent, prevailed, and to the ship Which soon should sail betook her. Not the tears Not the tears Of those she loved, who came in haste and strove To bend her purpose, moved her. So at last, Down the rude wintry channel, tossed the ship, Passing the pines, the heather, withered now; Passing the well-known cliffs, the towers of home And that high garden where, three brief months since, She sat a girl pining in luxury, And watched the strong ship fading in the West That bore her life away. The strong god Love Had nerved the girlish heart and braced her soul To high resolve, so that the wintry wave, The weary days of storm and stress and gloom, The strangers' faces round, affrighted not. Till, passing through the lion-guarded gates Into the Middle Sea, and by the blue Sicilian straits, and many a classic shore And fairy islet of the purple deep, She felt her heart beat faster as she saw, Crowning the Golden Horn the minarets Of Stamboul, knowing well her love had passed The self-same way before, and wondering much If there he lay wounded in some fierce fight Longing for her, or if indeed he lived Unwounded still, or mouldering, perchance, Upon the frozen, bleak Crimean plain, Dead of disease or cold or suffering, dead In battle slain, a bullet through his heart. Now when the ship cast anchor, and gave forth, Thronging the narrow, ill-paved city streets, That band of pitiful women, her first thought Was of her love; and when they gained at last The palace where the sick and wounded pined, Brought from the front by sea, shyly she asked If he were with the rest. But when she learned He had no hurt indeed, but on the field Was marked for higher rank, with thankful heart She wrote to tell him what had been, and prayed Forgiveness, and, if haply it might be, That she might come to him, or if indeed That might not be, she in the hospital Would live content, amid the duteous throng Of English nurses; only this she prayed That he would send one little word of love, And she would ask no more, only to hear That he was well. But when her husband knew All that had been, and that his maiden bride, That careless, delicate child, so lately won, Toiled uncompanioned 'mid the thousand woes Of ruthless war, his heart, so light before, Grew heavy in him, knowing not what fate Might yet befall. Yet since he loved her well. A passionate longing filled the young man's heart To embrace his dear, and be with her and smooth The hardships which she faced for him‚Äîay, though Through sickness and through wounds; and so he wrote A letter in his tent, when the day's tale Of labour and of danger now was done; A letter full of love: how he was well, Unwounded, happy; yet would give his health And scatheless limbs, if only he might feel, Paying the price of sickness or of wounds, The touch of her soft hand, and see her stoop To kiss him as he lay. But as he closed The letter, through the night above, the shrill Scream of a hurtling shell, then a loud crash. Nor knew he more, and the new-written page Fell from his hand, torn, crushed, and blurred with Blood. III. Then for that yearning, unrewarded heart There came the weary days of endless toil; The unaccustomed cares, the sleepless nights, Of scarce-snatched slumbers ending ere the dawn; The sordid offices; the delicate hands, Dressing the festering wounds; the cries and groans Worse than the battle's, the coarse sights which shocked The maiden's innocent eyes, the maniac shouts Of some poor fevered brain, the blasphemies Of desperate sufferers, the surgeon's knife, The blood, the shrieks of pain, till came at last Deep stillness, and the tortured figure lay Shrouded with folded hands, until they came Quickly and bore him forth, and on his bed Was laid another. All her tender heart Bled for the unsuspected miseries Of human life; her innocent eyes o'erflowed For daily, nightly woes, yet not the less She bore to give what aid of soothing hand And kindly word her girlish want of skill Might lend the wounded. Were they not like him, Soldiers with none to tend them, love or wife? How could she better show the love she bore To him who was her life than tending those Who were his comrades? So she steeled her heart To sights and sounds of misery, put aside Her maidenly disgust, and toiled to assuage The hopeless sum of woe. One fair-haired lad In helpless pain, and wandering in dreams, Muttered the name she loved, and when he woke Was tireless in his praise. Thenceforth she seemed To have a friend again, and eager heard How brave he was and tender; how he bore The stripling out of fire, and came for him When the fierce fight was done; and how the foe Was stubborn, and the struggle hard, and since The wounded might not bear the bitter cold Of those unsheltered heights, the transports brought Their load of helpless suffering week by week To those warm palace halls. She hearing all, Seemed to grow nearer to her love, and share His daily fortunes; and she tended well The grateful youth with daily, nightly care, Wrote shyly to his mother and his love, And learnt how thin the fence which rank and gold Set between man and man, and how the bond That binds the highborn, binds the lowly too In precious kinship. But no answering word Came from her dear, and heavier every day The load of anxious doubt, unexorcised, Pressed on her, as her cheek grew pale, and all The weight of hopeless service bore on her Too heavy for her strength. The menial tasks, Light while Hope gilded Duty, seemed to grow Heavier with every day that failed to bring News of her love; but she toiled bravely on Amid those dreadful sights and sounds, nor sought To shrink from them. But when the great ships passed Beneath the windows with their piteous freight Of wounded, who a few brief months before Sailed full of life and hope, her anxious mind, Not knowing what to hope, whether 'twere best He came with them, that she might nurse him back To life and health, or else, unhurt, alone (If haply still he breathed this earthly air), And far removed from her, should wait the fall Of the great fortress and the crowning fight, When Death should claim his thousands. But no news But no news Came, nor amid those close thronged halls of pain, Perplexed 'twixt joy and grief, she saw his face. Then one day when her soul was sick with fear, A letter from the Camp! writ by a hand She knew not. As she opened it there fell From the enclosing page a fragment, torn And stained with blood, in that familiar hand She loved so well. Her heart stood still to mark Those crimson stains, and yet it seemed to say That all was well with him, her love, her dear, Her husband. Every stained and blotted word, With Love's swift divination, she devoured, Yet could not understand. At last she turned To his who sent those dear, torn, blotted lines, And learnt the truth. ‚ÄúHe found his comrade lie Bleeding upon the ground, and by him lay Amid the ruins of their shattered home The fragments that he sent. 'Twas weeks ago, And he had hovered long 'twixt life and death, Tended by comrades, and too weak till then To join the rest who left those frozen fields For the warm city. But now his many wounds, Which were not deep, nor maiming face or limb, Were mending slowly, and he hoped to sail When next the mournful harvest of the war Left the bleak snow-clad heights.‚Äù She, reading this, Dissolved in love and grateful that her dear Was spared to her, felt a new spring of life Course through her. Then she told the youth she nursed, Within whose youthful veins Life's refluent tide Glowed once again; and on the crowded quay As the ship glided in they stood, and there She, in her sombre habit like a nun, Found him she sought; and he with a wan smile And feeble grasp greeted her, and they kissed, And then his tired eyes closed. But oh, how weak He seemed, how ashy grey his cheek, how thin The accents of his voice, which were so deep And manly! As she looked, the rising tears Blotted her sight‚Äîtears half of happiness And half of pity. To the hospital They passed, and she, fired with a newborn hope, Spent happy days and nights beside his bed, Drawing him back to life, and when at last The ebbing tide returned, and he grew strong And stronger day by day, there was no soul In all those crowded halls so blithe as hers Who was his wife. Then one day when her cares Were well nigh ended, from the house of pain They went together to a pleasant home By the Sweet Waters. Flowers of early spring Lit the dry, rustling woods where autumn leaves Lay scattered thickly still, and through the boughs Blue river-reaches, flecked with glancing sails, Smiled on them. There they gained in the new joy Of bursting life to lose the sordid stains Of pain and woe. Each sunny day that passed Brought its own store of strength for him who late Lay bleeding, and he blest the loving care Of his dear nurse. Amid that vernal air She tended him, and a sweet time of peace And tender love dawned for those sore-tried lives‚Äî A little time, too brief! For as his strength Grew greater, and no more the soldier lay Prostrate upon his bed, but once again With slow-paced footsteps, leaning on her arm, Wandered along the banks of the blue stream‚Äî Two wedded lovers, weaving fairy tales Of what the years should bring‚Äîhis loving eyes Woke suddenly one day, and marked how frail His girl-wife showed, how thin the pallid cheek, How deep the hectic rose, how bright the eyes, And with a bitter pang his conscious mind Knew what should be. For every day that passed Weak and more weak, despite her happiness And recompense of love, she showed, and soon, When now he walked again in nascent strength, No longer on her arm he leant for aid, But she on his, and presently he went Alone, while she, reclining, in the sun Hoarding her fast-decreasing sum of strength, Lay still as death, greeting him with a smile. So the swift weeks passed onwards equably, Brief happy weeks, the one reprieved from death, The other doomed to die. The air grew soft With fuller Spring. Again the trees grew green, The bursting woods, the fields a maze of flowers; Soft breezes fanned the stream, and the pale cheek Of her whose young life toils and cares and fears And sleepless vigils 'mid polluted air Had sapped; for whom her happiness had come Too late to save, only in time to make The end more bitter. Ere the swift Spring passed To summer, the hidden fever in her blood, Which long had smouldered, broke in open flame And burned that fragile house of life, and left But half-cold ashes, till the appointed hour, After brief days of suffering, when her Love, Requiting well her tender care, and strong In body though weak in heart, heard her lips say: ‚ÄúDear, it is hard to part. But I have been Happier to find the rugged thorny path Of Duty hidden in flowers, than when I knew The old smooth ways of ease. Lay me at rest Here among English graves in this blest place Where I have learnt to live. Ask for my fault Forgiveness of my mother and my sire, Whom I have disobeyed, and bid them think Tenderly of their daughter. When the war Is ended, and you pass again the cliffs Of England, and the garden 'midst the pines Where once‚Äîwas it years since, or yesterday?‚Äî I watched you go, taking my heart, my youth, My life with you, say a brief prayer for me, Your maiden-wife. Then if you will, forget; Or if you will, remember.‚Äù Then she breathed Her last within his arms, and he with tears, And one last kiss of parting, closed her eyes. They laid her in the place she would, amidst The Christian dead. Upon the hills the tall Black cypress-spires mark where the maiden lies, And from the minarets the Muezzin calls To prayer, where yet the resonant peals shall sound For Christian worship, when the accursed hordes Of lust and murder which to-day defile The garden of the earth are driven in shame Back to their native wastes. A thousand names Of English dead, each in its scanty plot Of alien earth, lie round her, where she waits, Poor faithful child, the peal that calls to life! IV. But when the last sad offices were done The soldier sought to lay the ghost of grief Through Duty. To the Camp once more he bent His willing feet. The comrades whom he left And Fortune spared, welcomed the grave sad man, Who from his new and secret sorrow turned To the old task, and careless, facing Death, Bore a charmed life. Day after day he fought Amid the van, unscathed, nor seemed to heed Whatever Fate might send, and with him went, Following in every perilous enterprise, The fair-haired lad whom from that earlier fight He bore to safety, and his girl-wife nursed, Dying herself, to life. Then by degrees The perils of each day, the abounding life, The glow, the glory of successful war Worked their sure work. Slowly he put from him The load of blank regret, and seemed again‚Äî A little graver than of old maybe‚Äî A soldier as before. His comrades' voice Acclaimed his selfless daring, yet he seemed More pitiful than before. His hand would spare The weakling; oft in act to shoot or strike He dropped his arm, his Love's imploring eyes Seeming to turn on him, fulfilled his soul With ruth and pity. Slow the weary war Dragged to its end; closer and closer crept The encircling lines; a scorpion ringed with fire The Fortress stung. Then came the fierce assault When thousands fell, but he was scatheless still Even as at first. And last the fateful morn When amid thundering shocks, fort after fort By its defenders' suicidal hands Leapt to the skies, and, amid smoke and flame, The strong fleet, trapped within the harbour, sank Or flared in ruin, and the Power of Ill, Which throws to-day its shield above the Turk, Stepped between him and righteous doom; and she, Our blindfold England, fought and did prevail For a mistaken end, where victory Was deadlier than defeat. In those dark days, Yet glorious too, that strenuous stricken soul, Unquestioning, did well his soldier's work, And when Peace came, though all but duty seemed Lost in that early grave, was crowned with rank And honour and fame, a leader among men. But when they left those blood-stained heights and set Their faces homewards, one brief week he gained To tarry with his love. The turf was green Already on her grave, and summer flowers Lighted it. There he set a marble cross Above her, with her name, and the scant sum Of her brief earthly years. Even as he gazed The Past came back to him, the sad, sweet Past, A little dimmed already by long months Of daily fateful war. And then he went, Wearing one pure white rose upon his breast, Plucked from her resting-place, to join the throng Of comrades homeward-bound. The great ship passed From sea to sea, leaving the windless South With its deep purples, for the long grey roll Of the Atlantic surge; green orange groves And vine-hung slopes, for heather and thymy downs In England. Last, one day his watching eyes Knew once again the well-remembered cliff Crowned with dark pines, and on its seaward edge A garden bright with flowers; and all the past Blossomed anew within him as he saw, Unchanged, the high-built turrets of her home, Who filled his heart. Almost his straining eyes Seemed once again to mark a white-robed form Wave her farewell. But ah! her long farewell Was months ago, and they had parted since Who now should meet no more! And then his thought Turned to his plighted word. He did not kneel, But, standing, breathed a silent thanks-giving, That loving her, he had been loved again, And, as she asked of him, such prayer as comes For those we love and lose‚Äîa wordless hope That it is well with them where'er the Unknown Holds them within His boundless waste of worlds, And when this pilgrimage of life is done That those who loved on earth may love in heaven. And then the salutary toil which brings An antidote to grief, the daily growth Of Life's broad tree, driving its roots deep down In homely earth, lifting its crest to heaven, With fruit and blossom crowned‚Äîno fragile flower, But with a thousand thick-leaved branches strong For rest or shelter‚Äîo'er that sore-tried soul Spread its protecting shade; and honour of men And tranquil wedded years, and childish hands, And once again, hard-fought, successful war In the far East, and waning years absorbed In homely leisure, 'mid the cherished fields Of long-fled youth;‚Äîobscured that precious dream And half-remembered grave, and that young life Given for his own. But in the wakeful night Before the dawn, or when his children sit Around his board, or in the joyous dance At Yuletide, when another Amy whirls, White-robed like her of yore, and smiles on him, Her grandsire,‚Äîto the old man's dreaming thought Scenes which those young lives knew not rise again Before his yearning eyes:‚Äîthat dear, dead Past, That girlish form waving a fond farewell, That tender, loving care, that early grave, Fill once again his eyes, thin as a dream, Not all unhappy; and the Present wanes, Lost in the glamour of the vanished Past. Thin as a dream! But what is all our life But dreamlike‚Äînay, a dream? And yet 'tis well To have dreamt it. One day, waking with the Dawn In some strange sphere, where Time nor Change disturbs, Nor dust nor noise of Life, but still and bright, The vanished Beauty of the Past revives; The long-drowned silent Music wakes again In that ethereal calm; our souls shall take, Clear as of old, the pageant of their lives On the old earth; unfading memories Of joy and pain, sorrow and sacrifice, Precious and unforgotten; all the store Of shining thoughts and deeds, pure gems undimmed Of the old treasure-house, and best of all To deck the enfranchised Soul to meet her King, The priceless jewel of undying Love. AH! WHAT IS TRUTH? Ah! what is Truth? Our failing eyes Pursue in vain the fleeting light; Beyond the darkening hills it flies, And ere we gain it, lo! the night. And what is Knowledge? But a gleam Which serves the encircling gloom to mark, A little light, a feeble spark, A phantasy, a bootless dream. And what is Faith? A mounting fire That through the black vault heavenward burns; A force which struggles to aspire, Then, sudden quenched, to earth returns. The night draws near, the night is here, Our feeble lanterns wane and die But, on the illimitable sphere New suns unnumbered light the sky. REGINA C≈íLI. What Shall I shape my life to gain? Not Riches; lower mundane things Spread wide their swift elusive wings, And who pursues them strives in vain. Nor Fame; for she fleets faster yet, Or comes not ere the closing tomb; The sun of Glory sets in gloom, And the world hastens to forget. Nor Rank nor Honours. Were it best Dowered of some weaker soul to live, Or bear the jewel none can give, Deep in the heart, not on the breast? Nor Pleasure; for her gains elude The weary seeker's baffled eyes; The wanton spurns him when she flies, Bound fast in hopeless servitude. Nor Love; because its flower divine Blooms with the Morn, nor long can stay, But withers in Life's fuller day And leaves the lonely heart to pine. Nor Beauty; though the fictive hand Fix some faint glimpses; Time the thief Cries, ‚ÄúArt is long, and Life is brief,‚Äù And slays us ere we understand. Nor Learning; for her laboured page Palls on the soul which nears the Truth; The thirst to know, the haste of Youth, Stir not the slower pulse of Age. To Duty only let me kneel, Her painful circlet on her brow! To her, my Queen, my head shall bow, Not knowing, but content to feel! All faint, all fade, all pass, but She Shines clear for young and ag√®d eyes, High as the peaks which kiss the skies, Profound as the unfathomed sea! THE TRUE STORY OF DAMON AND PYTHIAS. Two senators there were of Syracuse, When Dionysius the tyrant seized The reins of State, austere, of high repute, Still faithful to the fallen Commonwealth The young usurper slew. In closest links Of friendship lived the twain, whom not the bonds Of wedlock, nor the cares of fuller life, The love of children, the dividing power Of high ambition severed; but their souls, Close-knit together, still from youth to age Kept the old tie, so strong a golden chain Bound them together, stronger than the love Of wife and child, stronger than Life itself, Stronger than Death‚Äîthe bond of common Faith. For they, four centuries before Christ came, Following the mystic precepts of the sage Pythagoras, who, Saint at once and Seer, Taught, as our Master taught, the love of man (Not all the erring Race, both small and great, As He, but of the faithful Brotherhood), Contemned the Pagan worship, knowing well Wisdom and virtue and the mastery Of slavish lusts came not of acted rite Or incense, or the steam of sacrifice And suppliant hands uplifted to dead gods, But of the subtle music which attunes The chords of life to gracious Harmony. Wherefore a secret Order of the wise He founded, and a Brotherhood of love, Where each with each, toiling and suffering, Bearing his Brother's burden, might at last Rise to pure heights of gracious sacrifice And self-surrender, each contending voice Lost in the general Harmony of all. And, therefore, if a Brother of his Rule Fell fainting on the stony ways of life, The Sage commanded that his Brethren bore What succour they might give; and if he lay Sick among strangers, helpless, suffering, poor, And friendless, that the Brethren seeking him Should of their sacred Duty pay again Whatever gold or labour for his need The stranger spent; or if a Brother pined In jeopardy of life, his Brother's arm Should shield him, ay, though Death itself repaid The pious care. Thus each in each was lost, Bearing each other's burdens, till their lives Swelled the great concord, bearing, suffering, Rejoicing, till their pilgrimage was done, And they, through loftier spheres ascending, took A higher nature, rising grade by grade Of pureness, till at last the heavy load And burden of the flesh, this mortal coil, Which weighed them down, fell from them and they soared From sphere to higher sphere, enfranchised, purged, To some blest place of incorporeal souls. Now, since through all the isle, from sea to sea, The fame of their close friendship yearly grew, Till all men knew and wondered what high force Inspired their lives, soon to the tyrant's ear The knowledge came; and he, who loved indeed The accents of August Philosophy, Though lust of power and gold had led his feet Through miry swamps and thorny difficult ways, Incredulous heard. To that self-seeking soul The tales of high ungrudging sacrifice Seemed idle phantasies, unproved, untrue, Too thin for earth; and yet because his mind Was set on Knowledge, for herself, he longed To test them. Therefore gave he word to some, His parasites, that he was fain to try This faithful friendship and the link that bound Their lives: ‚ÄúFor though Pythagoras himself Bade him believe, he would not, well he knew Men's selfish hearts, bent upon narrow ends Caring for naught beside. What was it gained High place for him and honour, power and wealth, When little more than youth, but selfish ends, Sought without ruth for others, and achieved While all men envied? Had it been indeed A brother in the flesh, of the same stock, Born of the self-same womb, perhaps 'twere well To cleave to him, so that the union brought Nothing of loss. But men of alien blood, Bound by no closer tie than common faith, That such should cling together to loss of goods‚Äî Nay more, of life! The pious hypocrites! 'Twas time they were unveiled.‚Äù Therefore he bade His creatures swear an oath that Pythias Plotted his death. It mattered not a whit 'Twas but a lie, for if he found no friend To die for him, 'twere one malignant less, Or if he should, then two. Therefore they brought Their accusation, and the innocent Was doomed to die. But when he heard his fate, Scorning the usurper's power, ere the axe fell The tyrant of his cruel subtlety Offered this grace, that he might bid farewell To wife and children. When his yearning heart, Spite of himself, consented, with a sneer The tyrant cried, ‚ÄúAy, thou shalt go indeed If thou canst find a friend to die for thee At sunset, if thou comest not again. Hast thou a friend among thy Brother-hood Of hypocrites to risk his life for thine? Let him stand forth, and thou shalt have thy wish. See, it wants six hours now to set of sun; Go, but of this be sure, whate'er the cause If thou return not ere his latest rays Sink on the western hills, thy brainless friend Shall die for thee. Will any bear the risk? Let him stand forth!‚Äù Then Damon, who stood by, Sorrowing, to see the end, stood forth and cried, ‚ÄúI will be bound for him, and if he come not Will die the death.‚Äù Quickly the gaoler loosed The prisoner's chains and fixed on Damon's limbs Their heavy burdens. And without a word, Only a grateful gesture, Pythias turned, Took horse, and through the echoing city streets, Past pillared temples, marble palaces, And sounding colonnades‚Äîthe tyrant's work, Built on the city's ruined liberties‚Äî Flew like the wind amid the wondering crowds Of citizens, then left the town behind, And past the trellised vineyards and the fields Of waving grain, along the curving shore By town and hamlet flew. The laughing sea, Flecked with the widespread wings of dancing boats, Spread blue before him; far upon the sky √Ütna's enormous bulk; the silent ways Echoed the beating horse-hoofs, and his brain, One sad unceasing monotone of sound, One thought repeated oft, ‚ÄúAt set of sun Thou diest,‚Äù and again: ‚ÄúAt set of sun, Remember! time is short; it flies! it flies!‚Äù ‚ÄúBefore yon sun has set thy life is done, Or else thy friend's.‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeed on.‚Äù Until at last The old familiar fields and walls of home. Now, when he gained his well-loved palace gate His slave came forth, Lucullus, whom his hand Had cherished since his birth, bound by close ties Of loving service, and he bade him take His steed and tend him with all care, because Ere sunset he once more at Syracuse Must be for life or death. The faithful hind Obeyed without a murmur, wondering much What thing should be, dreading some perilous chance Waited his lord. And then the senator, The same voice calling him, ‚ÄúRemember well Thou diest, or thy friend, at set of sun,‚Äù Entered his well-loved home. He kissed his wife And children dear, striving with trivial talk Of home and homely things to hide his care, Which pressed him sore; but she regarding him With love's keen eyes, and that unwonted weight Of trouble on his brow, would question him What things had been, till last she drew from him The sorrowful tale; how ere that day was done He stood condemned to death, and how he came Only to bid farewell to those his eyes Should see no more in life. Then she who heard Broke forth in sobs and wailings, and accused The tyrant's pitiless spite. But with calm words And precepts of the Master, he would soothe The woman's passionate grief, until she lay Silent upon his breast, and round them stood Their children, hardly knowing what had been Or what should come to be. But as they spoke With heightened tones, the listening slave without Caught this dear master's words, and hearing, knew The instant peril. Quick he stole to where The tired steed, resting from his journey, stood Asleep, and then taking a high resolve, Knowing his master's steadfast mind, and fain To save him from himself, and caring naught For aught beside, with one sure stroke he stabbed The poor beast to the heart, and then he fled His master's anger. With declining day, After long hours of pain, from his sad home Came Pythias forth, watching the westering sun With heavy heart, for still that warning voice, ‚ÄúRemember, ere the sunset,‚Äù called to him, And from his weeping wife and children dear Tore himself free, and, parting with a groan, Flung forth on his return, prepared to die, Since Fate had willed it thus, and sought long time His slave Lucullus. But in vain he called, For nowhere was he found; then desperate, Marking the flight of time, he sought and found His horse where he had left it, but the beast, Stabbed to the heart, lay dead. Then in despair He fled his home and rushed with frenzied haste Along the road he came, hastening long miles On foot to Syracuse, until his limbs Failed him, his heart throbbed high, his breath came short, And, stumbling as he went, he fell, and lay A long while senseless. When his life returned The old voice filled his ears. The sinking sun Cast lengthening shadows. To his feet once more Struggling, and doubting much if time remained To save his friend, a little space again He tottered in despair. And then, behold, Just when his stiffening limbs refused to move Another foot-pace, tethered to a tree, The stout steed of some passing wayfarer Caparisoned! Then to the saddle quick Mounting, and giving rein, he breathed again, If he might save his friend's life by his own. Mile after mile the headlong chase swept on By the dark, purple sea. The ghostly peaks Of √Ütna flushed, lit by the dying sun; The white sails reddened; the long rays, oblique, Lower and lower sank, dazzling his sight With shafts of ruddy gold. No sound arose On the hushed evening but the hurried beat Of ringing hoofs, and the quick-coming throb Of laboured breath, as the tired charger reeled Upon his way. Lower, and lower still, The sinking sunbeams shot athwart the fields, And his heart sunk in turn. Then once again The echoing streets, thick with applauding crowds, As on they flashed; the palace marbles, pink With sunset; till at last the waiting throng, The tyrant and his guard, the headman's axe, Lit by the dying rays; and as the sun Sank red upon the hill, the breathless horse Staggered and fell, and Pythias, leaping down, Fell upon Damon's neck, knowing him saved. Then at the tyrant's nod, the gaolers struck The chains from Damon's limbs, and Pythias, Laying his patient head upon the block, Prepared to die; when lo, a voice was heard, Grown softer than of wont, and merciful: ‚ÄúEnough! I have proved them. In this sordid world, Where he who thinks to mount above the plain Must wade through blood and mire, breathing foul air Of perfidy and fraud, to gain his end, And find it worthless, lying, cozening, And all for naught,‚Äîpure natures still are bound Indissolubly. More than sovereign power, And gold and vein√´d marbles, are to him The crowned philosopher who sits above The subject crowd, and, having gained the height Of earthly things, contemns them; the calm eyes And aspect of Divine Philosophy Which conquers self, and from the warring notes Of individual lives draws subtly forth Some gracious, unsuspected harmony, Some mystic chain of numbers, which binds fast The waste and chaos of discordant aims In some new cosmic order. I have found‚Äî I, who have striven, and prize more than my crown And blood-stained triumphs of successful war The laurel of Olympia‚Äîa new height Of knowledge; a new virtue unattained, And yet attainable; a sacrifice, A Brotherhood; a self surrender, winged To higher Heaven than the sensual Gods' To whom the ignorant kneel. Go! ye are free; I pardon you. But now I pray ye take Your ruler to your friendship, teaching me The secrets of your creed, a proselyte To serve a common Master. Then he made As if to embrace them. But no answering word The Brethren spake, and slowly turned and went, Bowing their silent heads. The tyrant stretched His arms in vain, as honouring their faith, Fired with some half-false reverence for the truth His life denied. But they would none of him. ARMENIA, A.D. 1894-5. Dead by their ravaged fields And blackened roof-trees chill, After long woes at rest, Our martyred brothers lie. Through the dark forests, deep, Naked and famished, creep The sad survivors of a race oppressed; White on the blue autumnal sky, Ararat's sacred hill O'er the forlorn and ruined plain Uncaring seems to smile‚Äî Uncaring for the blood, the wrong, the guile, The hopeless griefs, the oft-repeated pain, The innocent lives defiled, the supplications vain The spoiler robs and preys, With rape and torture for his daily work. Unchecked the wolfish Kurd torments and slays. The obscene, ineffable Turk, False heart and glozing tongue, Fills all the hapless land with lust and blood. Into the murder-pits are flung Dying and dead together, old and young, The sire, the mother with her unborn child, The virgin lives defiled. Or if escape there be 'tis through the shame Of souls too weak to avow the Holy Name, Or theirs who from the dreadful precipice, Veiling their desperate eyes, Plunge with their children through the void to gain, Dying, release from pain. What? Has God's thought forgot His people's woes? Doth His averted ear No more their cries of hopeless anguish hear‚Äî The wail for precious lives, which now are not? Shall not the all-seeing Eye Look downward from the dumb unheeding sky And with a glance confound the might of Ill? Shall the oppressor still Through endless √¶ons wreak his fiendish will‚Äî Ravish and rob and murder in the name Of that dark Antichrist whose rule of shame Blights the dead East; for whom the spear, the sword, And ruthless horrors of unsparing war Are weapons fitter far Than are the futile forgeries of his Word, Who, knowing not compassion, yet makes sure With prayer from lips impure Of Paradise‚Äîno place of Innocence, Or white-winged soaring Hope immense, But a foul Lazar-house of Lust and Sense? And this, our Europe strong, Which at a common altar boasts to kneel, Shall no compassionate yearning come to move, No stirrings of fraternal love, For these our brothers who have pined so long? Shall She no pity feel For these, the martyrs of our Faith who sigh, Treading the cold and sunless ways of death Long ere they gain to die; Strong Russia, Champion of the Christian East; France, through whose soul, too generous to forget, The ardour of St. Louis pulses yet; Our noble England, with the years increased, A mightier Venice with ‚Äúthe East in fee,‚Äù And her great eldest daughter, She Who sits august and free A crownless Commonwealth from sea to sea. Shall these, unmoved by the long Past of pain, Wait till the tide of blood returns again And watch once more their helpless brethren die, These who upheld or spared the waning secular lie? Nay, nay, it is enough! enough! No more Shall black Oppression rule. Her reign is o'er. No more, O Earth! no more! No more! Forbid it, Heaven! Arise, O puissant Christendom, be strong! God's voice within you calls‚Äîthe voice of Fate! Confound this monstrous tyranny of wrong. Let Love prevail, not Hate! With you the Future lies. 'Twere shame indeed If mutual jealousies, if coward fears, Adding fresh force to swell the sum of ill, Prolonged the accursed reign of pain and tears, And bade again a hapless nation bleed. Succour the weak! Drive back their pitiless foes! Let not despair afflict your brethren still! Let the new-coming Age, a happier birth, Bless these waste-places of the suffering Earth! Let Peace, with Law, the tranquil valleys fill, And make the desert blossom as the Rose! August 17, 1895. SONG. [We are stirred, we are thrilled, we are fired] We are stirred, we are thrilled, we are fired By impetuous pulses of Song, Not perceiving the Power that hurried the spirit along, Nor the Presence that inspired, Nor what hidden passion swells the throat With that high-soaring note. We are laden and sunk and opprest By a load of despondence and dread, Not knowing what mystical presence unseen, unconfessed, Those deep misgivings bred, Nor why across the mute and tuneless soul Dumb tides of silence roll. Ah, whether in silence or song the high music may come, A dark hand rules the strings; Be it Love, be it Hope, be it Faith the high melody wings, Or Doubt which strikes it dumb, A hidden Player sweeps the mystic chords Too high, too deep for words. A CHRISTMAS CAROL. Another Christmas-tide, Another solemn mirth, White robed again and purified, Once more the wondering Earth Listens, while on the frosty, star-lit air, As of old time the glad Angelic throng, The midnight chimes peal out in bursts of joyous song. This is the Day which saw His Birth! Rejoice, be glad, oh Earth! In old fanes over seas, In humble homes of prayer, His people, bending faithful knees, Welcome Him everywhere; O'er earth's unbounded plains, from pole to pole, Swift speeds the blessed day when first He came To raise a fallen world from lowest depths of shame. This is the Day which saw His Birth! Rejoice, be glad, oh Earth! Therefore men's souls rejoice, Though sullen winter's spite May send to drown their jubilant voice Wild storms and furious night. To-day we keep our solemn festival; No presage warns of coming tragedy, Only our newer hope immense begins to be. This is the Day which saw His Birth! Rejoice, be glad, oh Earth! Our hope! But when, indeed, Shall Peace on earth prevail? When shall the innocent cease to bleed, The sorrowful to wail? Murder and war and rapine still Christian and Heathen vex alike to-day, Though since on earth He came ages have rolled away. Yet on this Day which saw His Birth! Rejoice, be glad, oh Earth! Despair not, waiting Earth; Have faith, and thou shalt see How from that far-off mystic birth At last comes Victory. Meet, brethren, round the sacred hearth of home, With souls and minds by ancient faith inspired, With glowing hearts by love and pity pierced and fired. This is the Day which saw His Birth! Rejoice, be glad, oh Earth! Peace and good-will to all, Be this our Christmas song; Raise up the erring feet which fall, The feeble hands make strong. Though the slow ages leave His work undone, Let us, who feel and mourn our brothers' need, Find in his tender words an all-sufficing creed. So shall this Day which saw His Birth Make glad the waiting Earth. IN BOHEMIA.. See the correspondence from Vienna (Daily News, November 20, 1895). This tale I seemed to hear a Gipsy tell, A dark-browed woman prisoned in a cell In wild Bohemia: ‚ÄúAy, 'twas in the gloom Of the dark, twilight pine-woods far away They found me sitting, somewhat dazed, I think, By what sad things had been, and slow to move When all was done; self-chained, as I am now Within this lonely cell, and pondering All the sad Past. I know not what the Law Can do with me, nor care. But there‚Äîjust there Where you stand now‚Äîdo you see two corpses lie, One, shot through the brain, who bears a stony calm Upon his face; and one with staring eyes And knitted brows, and clenched jaws, breathing rage And balked revenge? Do you see the crimson stain Steal on‚Äîor is it fancy, and there comes Nothing to break the bare and ghastly white Of this unlovely cell, and I but dream That dreadful dream again? What? would you learn How 'tis that I come here a prisoner bound By self-forged chains? Our swift Gitana blood Breeds savage jealousies and hates and loves‚Äî Not the slow current of your Northern veins, But a fierce tigerish impulse, half desire, Half selfish pride. We wanderers keep to-day The unbridled passion, which the tropic sun Burned in our blood; and I am of my race, As you of yours. Two there were sought my love. One a man, strong, with all the vigorous strength Of manhood, tall of stature, black of beard, And swarthy cheeked‚Äîa strenuous mate to bind A woman's wandering wings‚Äîstrong arms and loins; A husband more than lover, so that long I doubted if 'twere well to smile on him, Half fearful lest his fierce and tyrannous will Should prove too strong for mine. Therefore it was I hesitated, drawn now here, now there. I think I never loved him; though maybe His splendid manhood drew me as it draws Weak women the world over‚Äîus who toil And wander day by day, and lie by night Tired 'neath the gazing stars, and those who sink, After soft days of silken dalliance, Canopied close, in down and perfumed ease, Within their gilded palaces. They too Are women weak as I, and loving well The strong, supporting arm‚Äîay, though sometimes 'Twere raised in anger‚Äîand the resonant tones And flashing eye, because their strength confirms Our weakness. But because our souls are weak, Not strength alone allures us, but the charm Of youth, the scarcely shaded lip and cheek, The dark plume on the brow, the lissom grace Of budding age; and one there was, a boy Of fitting years to mine, bold as a god, And lithe as a young panther, and he cast Dark passionate eyes on me, as he had cast them Upon a score before, and at the tones Of his gay accents, all the woman's love Of beauty and things fair rose up and strove For mastery with the woman's shrinking nature That loved the guiding hand, and overthrew it While he was near‚Äîlove of the sight alone, Not of the heart or mind. And though I knew not Which love to choose, it was the eyes' desire Prevailed at last. And yet I do not think I loved him; for when all the gossips came To tell me he was faithless, now with this one And now with that, it was not pain I knew, Only contempt for him and wounded pride, And (though that argues unrequited love) A longing for revenge. You cannot know, You Northerns, through whose veins the tepid blood Creeps slowly, with what pulses the hot tide Leaps from our torrid hearts. Therefore I planned A subtle scheme. I wrote a loving letter, Bidding him meet me in the wood when eve Was falling; I had much to say to him, And begged that he would come, for it might prove The last time we should meet, and we should be Together and alone. Then, when 'twas sent, I wrote another to the man I feared, Not loved, and bade him to the trysting-place A little later, when the dying sun Was sinking on the hills, and I would give him The answer he had asked. When all was done, And both I knew would come‚Äîpoor fools allured By love, where love was not, only revenge And hatred‚ÄîI went forth without a word After my toil was done, and took with me, Half ignorant of what I did or wherefore, Concealed upon my bosom, like the asp Of our Egyptian Queen, with shining tube, A tiny weapon, for what end I know not Nor knew; but with our Gipsy blood 'tis well, When passions rise to fever-heat, to hold Some strength reserved, and I had done that day That which might lead to bloodshed, and 'twere best The way to escape lay open, if my fate At last should leave me lonely to despair. Then when the dying day, declining, cast Its longer shadows through the darkling wood, Hastening, within a little glade I found My youthful lover waiting at the place Where he should die ere sunset. As I saw him, It did repent me of my deed. I fain Had warned him of his doom; but as we sate Upon a fallen tree-trunk, side by side, Some careless boast, some burst of mocking mirth, Some jibe at woman's love, or covert sneer, Fanning my jealous fancies into flame, Filled all my soul with madness. And the sun Sank on the hills and a cold chill of eve Breathed like the breath of Fate, as, looking up, I saw the angry face and lurid eyes Of the avenger burn; and knew that doom Was night, fierce fight and blood, and pain and death. Ah, I remember well with what fierce rage, Poor fools! they rushed together. I mocked them both, Dupes of a loveless woman who cared naught Whatever ill befell them, when they closed In mortal combat, the strong stalwart man And the lithe agile youth. Long time the fight Raged doubtfully, 'twixt those slow-moving limbs And that swift panther-tread; they struck, they strained, They twined, until at last the younger fell, O'erborne, upon the earth. Then with a cry Of rage he rose, and soon the keep knives flashed Red in the last rays of the sinking sun; The dark eyes, lighted by an inward fire, Burned with the light of hate. And I sat mute And motionless, watching as those who sit Sporting with blood and pain. I had no wish To stay their hands, nor spoke one soothing word To avert their doom. The keen eyes, the quick limbs, The feints, the thrusts, the parries, moved me not, Who sat with eager eyes, and watched the fight, Like some tempestuous drama, to the close, From act to breathless act. There came no sound But the quick clash of steel, the deep drawn breaths, The crackle of trampled wood, until at last One agonizing cry, and my young lover, With large reproachful eyes, fell at my feet, Stabbed to the heart. Then all my former hate Transformed to love and pity, I rose and fell Upon his breast, and kissed him ere he died; And when I rose I saw the angry eyes Of the other bent on me, as if he knew My secret and despised me. Not a word He spoke, nor I, but straight, the rushing flood Of passionate love transformed itself to hate Of him who did despoil me, and contempt For life and for myself, and a great rage Against the stronger, rising, blotted out All my old thoughts. No more I sought to gain Deliverance dying. As he stood before me With fierce, victorious eyes, I raised my hand, Drew forth the little asp from out my breast, And stung him through the brain. He fell beside The other, and I stirred not till 'twas night; And when they came, they found me pondering still On all that sad day's deeds, as if the play Was done, and I tired out and loath to stir, Though all the lights were out. I did not know I loved him till he died, or I had waived My poor revenge, or when he died had turned My weapon on myself. 'Twas Love, not I, That took another life. A murderess Call they me? Ah! nay, nay; 'twas never murder, When unforeseen misfortune, suddenly Arising like a storm-cloud from the sea, O'erwhelms us. 'Twas not I that slew my love; I knew not that I loved. Had I not loved him, I had not slain his slayer, but had borne An innocent conscience, and had died self-slain, A blameless suicide. But now they come, Those servants of your pallid, prudish law, And measure our quick pulses, our hot tides Of passion by your bloodless ordinances. Not thus they used, in that far ancient East, Ere first we wandered here. I pray you, sir, Think not such ill of me. And yet, oh Heaven, I know not! Why lie those two corpses there, There day and night, one with a stony calm, And one with angry, unrelenting eyes?‚Äù LLYN OWAIN. A Legend of the Vale of Towy. Amid the folded hills The lake lies darkly clear; A death-like calmness stills The deep-set mere. And on its tranquil face, Like stars upon the night, Asleep in nymphlike grace, Float lilies white. Once, where the lake is now‚Äî Thus old-time legends tell‚Äî Lay, fathom-deep below, A magic well, A bubbling fountain deep Of fairy hands the boon Where shepherds drove their sheep, Parching with noon. Free gift of elfin grace For all, whose need being done, Should on the spring replace The covering stone. There on his dusty way, A thirst and weary, came One whom the blaze of day Burned like a flame. Sir Owain, a brave knight Of Arthur's court, had come Victor in many a fight, To his old home. Weary and spent was he, Weary his faithful steed; They stumble helplessly In mortal need. When on the sweet old spring Belov√©d by the boy, The man's eyes, wandering, Lighted with joy. Straight from the bubbling source They drank long draughts and deep; Then, with recruited force, Sank long in sleep. But the knight, wholly spent, Nor aught remembering, Sealed not before he went That gracious spring. Then through a waking dream He seemed to hear the sound, Of a loud, threatening stream, Which hemmed him round. And seeking in surprise Those vanished pastures green, Straightway his sorrowing eyes Knew what had been. For where the emerald mead Smiled, white with flocks, before, Dark waters rolled instead From shore to shore. Then the stout knight, dismayed By what his hand had done; In some blind cave, afraid, Hid from the sun. And there in slumbers deep He waits his fated hour, To rise from secular sleep By Arthur's power. For he shall wake again When Arthur's voice doth call; And from that long-drowned plain The flood shall fall. Fair legend which can bring A god-like voice and arm, To curb the unfettered spring Of age-long harm. Come soon, blest Presence strong; Bring wisdom in thy train; The earth lies sunk in Wrong‚Äî Come thou again! LLYWELYN AP GRUFFYDD. An Ode. After dead centuries, Neglect, derision, scorn, And secular miseries, At last our Cymric race again is born, Opens again its heavy sleep-worn eyes, And fronts a brighter Morn. Shall then our souls forget, Dazzled by visions of our Wales to Be, The Wales that Was, the Wales undying yet, The old heroic Cymric chivalry? Nay! one we are indeed, With that dim Britain of our distant sires Still the same love the patriot's bosom fires, With the same wounds our loyal spirits bleed, The heroes of the Past, are living still By each sequestered vale, and cloud-compelling hill. Dear heart that wast so strong To guide the storm of battle year by year, Last of our Cymric Princes! dauntless King! Whose brave soul knew not fear! Thou from Eryri's summits, swooping down Like some swift eagle, o'er the affrighted town And frowning Norman castles hovering, Onward didst bear the flag of Victory; And oft the proud invader dravest back In ruin from thy country's bounds, and far Didst roll from her the refluent wave of war, Till 'neath the swelling flood The low fat Lloegrian plains were sunk in blood. Long through rude years of Force and trampled Laws, Thy strenuous arm sustained thy country's cause, Champion of Wales; thou through the storm of fight The ruddy Dragon barest flaming bright; Defeat or Victory, Alike were naught to thee, Undaunted warrior for thy country's weal, Scorning the hurtling shaft, the piercing steel; With thy raw levies fronting without fear The Marchers' serried ranks, the Norman's spear, Comrade of that strong Earl whose prescient mind The coming tyrants' power could bind, And by free air of high debate, Healing the ills of State, Laid firm for centuries to be The fair broad stone of Britain's liberty. I see thy love-tale blossom like a rose, Amid the desert of thy troublous life, Girt round by watchful foes, And arid wastes of endless pain and strife; The fair maid, sweet and mild, The great Earl's best-loved child, Whom crossing the tempestuous sea, Rude pirate hands long rapt from thee, At last in some brief truce from war's alarms Given to thy faithful arms; I see thy nuptial pomps by Worcester's reverend shrine, With England's and with Scotland's King And close thronged nobles witnessing; And then two little years of wedded peace Thy struggles' brief surcease, Till thy loved Queen, rapt from the cheerful day, Traversed too soon the unattended way, Leaving her child and thee, and to thy loveless home No voice of comfort more, nor peace again might come. I see thee when thy lonely widowed heart Grew weary of its pain, In one last desperate onset vain, Hurl thyself on thy country's deadly foes; From North to South the swift rebellion sped, The Castles fell, the land arose; Wales reared once more her weary war-worn head Through triumph and defeat, a chequered sum, Till the sure end should come, The traitorous ambush, and the murderous spear; Still 'mid the cloistered glories of Cwmhir, I hear the chants sung for the Kingly dead, While Cambria mourned thy dear dishonoured head. Strong son of Wales! thy fate Not without tears, our Cymric memories keep; Our faithful, unforgetting natures weep The ancestral fallen Great. Not with the stalwart arm, After her age-long peace, We serve her now, nor keen uplifted sword, But with the written or the spoken Word Would fain her power increase; The Light we strive to spread Is Knowledge, and its power Comes not from captured town or leaguered tower; A closer brotherhood Unites the Cymric and the Anglian blood, Yet separate, side by side they dwell, not one, Distinct till Time be done. But we who in that peaceful victory Our faith, our hope repose, With grateful hearts, Llywelyn, think of thee Who fought'st our country's foes. Whose generous hand was open to reward The dauntless patriot Bard, Who loved'st the arts of Peace, yet knewest through life Only incessant strife. Who ne'er, like old Iorwerth's happier son, Didst rest from battles won, But strovest for us still, and not in vain; Since from that ancient pain, After long ages, Cambria of thy love Feels through her veins new patriot currents move, And from thy ashes, like the Phoenix, springs Skyward on soaring wings, And fronts, grown stronger for the Days that Were, Whatever Fortune, 'neath God's infinite air, Fate and the Years prepare! LINES ON THE UNVEILING OF THE STATUE OF THE RIGHT HON. JOHN BRIGHT, FEBRUARY 11, 1896. Seven years have fled since on thy honoured clay I laid a fading wreath of grateful verse; Willing, once more I come again to-day Thy unforgotten virtues to rehearse; Friend of the friendless else, thou art not dead Whilst still one voice laments thy honoured head! Nay, nay, rejoice! the time is past for tears. Now when our long-lost leader comes to stand Pleading once more for England 'midst his peers, Pure as the marble from the sculptor's hand,‚Äî Not grief be ours, but joy that he has come, Who being dead yet speaketh, to his home. Here 'mid the lengthening pageant of the Great Still let him stand, speechless yet eloquent, Taking the eager air of high debate, And echoes of our freeman's Parliament; Here let him plead as erst impassioned strong In love of Right, and scorn and hate of Wrong. Ah! well that he is come! the peoples groan; Torture and murder vex them day by day. Would he were living still to hear their moan And fright the acoursed spoiler from his prey! Yet though that voice warlike for peace is gone, Pray Heaven its accents still go widening on! Here from his silent lips be wafted far A gracious message over land and sea, Deep horror of the fratricide of War, High aspirations for the Peace to be, As when long years ago his eloquent word, Though spent in vain, the listening Senate stirred. Here let him plead again the toiler's cause, The burden of the oppressed, the weak, the slave, Crushed to the earth by old abusive laws; The voice of freedom dies not with the grave; Mute though they seem, those lips so cold and white Shall glow with burning utterance for the right. Stand here, great Englishman! Earth knows to-day No prouder title than that worldwide name; Though thrones and rank and honours pass away, There comes no cloud that shall obscure thy fame. Here in the precincts where thy years were spent Inspire, sustain thy well-loved Parliament! LLANSTEPHAN. Slowly upon the glowing evening skies The orange cloudlets fade in lifeless gray, While from these broken towers my yearning eyes O'er western seas pursue the dying day, Till where the sinking sunbeams late would burn, Fringed with cold fires, the deepening waters churn. No sound arises save the sea-bird's cry; Where drowned beneath his stars the Day-God lies. But hark! like some weird whisper of a sigh The dim mysterious ocean-voices rise, The beat of hidden pulses from afar; The never-silent moaning of the bar. Here let me lie and trace in Fancy's glass Again the sea-tales strange of classic eld, Watch with wreathed horns the floating Tritons pass, And sea-nymphs last of Pagan eyes beheld, Fair Nereids sporting on the moonlit sand, And Sirens calling from the enchanted land. There breathes no breath across the heaving plain, No phantom sail awakes the slumbering sea; Here will I muse and watch, a Greek again, The spume-flecked currents drifting silently, And people half-hid coves and shadowy capes With gliding presences and elfin shapes. Even thus the old sea spake, nor otherwise, To Homer's dreaming fantasy of yore; But ah! our duller brains and dimmer eyes! The primal glory fled from sea and shore! No more may we discern the visions fair Which lit our youngling planet everywhere. Nay, nay, the old grace fades not; land and sea Enchanted are, as erst when Man was young; Dull knowledge flouts not all their mystery, Not all fair dreams are dreamt, or sweet songs sung. Still, still, while youth and spring-tide come to birth, These fair fantastic visions light the earth. Here let me dream, and for a while forget, Beneath the magic moonlight's ghostly smile, Life's rude tumultuous waves, the toil, the fret, The strifes, the jealous hates, the wrong, the guile, And wake from nature's arms, with new-purged sense, To that immortal Pagan innocence. AN ODE ON THE INSTALLATION OF H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES AS CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WALES, JUNE 26, 1896. This is our joyous hour, The Dawn expected long; Break, ‚ÄúSea of music,‚Äù in a surge of song! The long, long night of ignorance is done, Triumphant o'er our land the Orient sun Shines with renascent power; Our little Wales that lay asleep In secular slumbers deep Awakes for whatsoe'er of nobler fate, What ampler, happier fortunes fair, The hidden years prepare. Here on the sounding margin of the sea, Whence the shy Mountain-Spirit dwells not far, We who of hills and sea the children are Unite to-day in joyous pageantry, To-day rejoice! On this auspicious morn, From Strife to Peace re-born Our lost Llywelyn seems again to come, For love of learning to his ancient home; While with her fair-grown daughters twain Our gracious Royal Lady smiles again! Rejoice! it is a joyous day; The dawn of Knowledge drives the night away; Young Summer comes, the skies and seas are blue; Lo, a new spirit breathing, maketh all things new! Brief are our lives upon the labouring earth, Our tasks of little worth; Ere half is done, a cold voice calls, and then, Beyond the ways of men, We know no more the joy of emulous strife, The toils, the victories of life. A little while we are, and then ere long Still is the busy brain, and hushed the voice of song. Men sow, but others reap, While in oblivion deep, Far off, we know not where, the toilers lie asleep. Already round our new-built Temple fair, The fragrant memories of the faithful Dead Bloom frequent everywhere. Already ere its walls completed stand, Or its consummate spires assail the skies, There waits without the gate a noble band Of patient ghosts who gaze with yearning eyes. Not upon earth 'twas theirs to see The bright ideal of their life-long dream, Our native Academe; But we who on their labours enter, we, Shall we forget to give the honour due To those whose provident thought our country's need foreknew, Those unrewarded spirits now at rest Who laboured for the Best? Blest patriots of our long-drawn centuries, And ye but lately vanished from our eyes, Rejoice! If echo of our fortunes here Can reach and wake the spiritual ear, Henceforth our well-loved Cymric land Shall 'mid her sisters stand, Dowered not alone with what of precious lore The dead Past holds in store, But the fair harvests of the days to be, The hidden treasures, more than gems or gold, More precious far than old Philosophy, Which Science boasts to hold. The New Age calls, and we upon the verge Hear the weird thunders of the magic surge; New thoughts, new gains, the imminent future brings; Fairer than ever in his cloistered cell The visionary searcher wondering saw:‚Äî Forces unknown subdued; rich fields of Ordered Law, Where sown with Ruin trackless deserts awe; Enchanted forests, caverns, pitiless seas, And further, dimmer, darker still than these, The Secret through the ages guarded well, Of Life, of Death, Good, Evil, Heaven and Hell. Rise Thou, dear land, on Learning's even wings, Rise in Heaven's face, and, soaring, leave behind Thy sordid outworn robe of lower Things; The eye by grosser mists grown blind; The earthy soul; the unawakened mind; All jealous hates, all faithless fears, And low delights more pitiful than tears. Awake! advance! arise! ascend at length Thro' wider knowledge to a fuller strength, To loftier heights, and nobler ends complete. Purge throughly from thy late-enfranchised sight The clouds, the glooms of Time's departed Night, Soar, higher, higher, with the increasing light Where throned, with clouds beneath her shining feet, Sits Wisdom crowned with Right! CIVITAS DEI. Oh splendours unattainable! Oh heights unclimbed of thought! Oh hidden secrets of the skies, By lifted hands and straining eyes, Through dim, unnumbered centuries Unprofitably sought. Yet must our hopeless vision scan The immeasurable plan. The earth with Spring's first flowers grows glad, The skies, the seas are blue, But still shall finer spirits turn With hearts that long, and souls that burn, And for some ghostly whiteness yearn, Some glimpses of the True; Chasing some fair ideal sweet, Breathless with bleeding feet. High Summer comes with warmth and light. The populous cities teem; Through statue-decked perspectives, long, Aglow with painting, lit with song, Surges the busy, world-worn throng. But, ah! not these their dream, Not these, like that white ghost allure, August, celestial, pure. Crowning the cloud-based ramparts, shines The City of their love; Now soft with fair reflected light, And now intolerably bright, Dazzling the feeble, struggling sight, It beckons from above. It gleams above the untrodden snows, Flushed by the Dawn's weird rose. It gleams, it grows, it sinks, it fades, While up the perilous height, From the safe, cloistered walls of home, Low cot, or a√´ry palace dome The faithful pilgrims boldly come. Though Heaven be veiled in night, They come, they climb, they dare not stay, Whose feet forerun the Day. And some through midnight darkness fall Missing the illumined sky; And some with cleans√®d heart and mind, And soul to lower splendours blind, The city of their longing find, Clear to the mortal eye. By all, or here, or leagues beyond the Sun, At last the Height is won. HARVEST-TIDE. TO VENUS, THE EVENING STAR. Pure orb serene, that shinest still Tho' youth be fled and Spring-time done, And dreary Autumn, dark and chill, Obscure our brief days' waning sun, Oh Love, oh radiant Star! Shine forth, and all is peace and light, Tho' the sun sink and with him life! Hide, and the deadly gloom of night Descends, with hate, and wrong, and strife, Oh Love, oh radiant Star! Not thine the glare of garish noon, Nor fever-heats of wild desire, Nor craters of the ghostly moon Silvered with dead phosphoric fire, Oh Love, oh radiant Star! But glowing, pure with primrose flame, Steadfast as virgin-glances are, Thro' life's swift seasons still the same Light thou our heavenward pathway far, Oh Love, oh radiant Star! THE COMING OF THE MUSE. The shy Muse, rarely seen, at times Floats down yet will not stay, But hides her unembodied rhymes Far, far away. From out the blank unpeopled page There shines no vision fair, And on the poet's noble rage Broods cold despair. In vain to toil, in vain to strive, Efforts and vows are naught: No favouring impulse comes to drive The lagging thought. Then sudden, 'mid the darkling chill, Dead hope and strivings vain, A ghostly radiance seems to fill His heart and brain. Far off and thin, translucent, white, His straining eyeballs trace, Half-hidden, a phantom of delight, A sweet veiled face. And straight, 'tis Life, 'tis Youth, 'tis Spring That comes his toil to cheer; Blithe Fancy spreads a joyous wing‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Muse is here.‚Äù O'er foam-flowered wave, o'er snow-clad hill, She floats, or vernal grove; His happy eyes warm tear-drops fill Of Faith and Love. Now from the Sunset beckons she, Now from the Dawn's clear rose, And sadly now, now joyously, Sings as she goes; Now through the thick life-laden air, Along the city street, Fleeting, she draws divinely fair, His faithful feet; Now o'er the Palace, now the Jail, Lives gilded, lives undone, Lives laughter-lit, or those that wail, She hovers on; And with her takes the poet's mind, And heart and soul and will; Where'er she leads, a wandering wind, He follows, follows still! LE VENT DE L'ESPRIT. The wind that sighs before the dawn Chases the gloom of night, The curtains of the East are drawn And suddenly‚Äî'tis light. A faint breath wakes the slumbering seas, Peaks, plains, and forests dim, The brave birds 'mid the rustling trees Raise a glad morning hymn. And all the waiting world around Adores the coming sun, New warmth and life, new cheerful sound, New destinies begun. So on the old familiar earth, As on the faintest star, Where'er a new life comes to birth The Spirit's breathings are. Thro' the soul's dim recesses dark They move ere yet 'tis day, And she even as the faithful lark Awaking, soars away. They blow, they stir the voiceless deep With winds of fruitful strife, And from the chills of Death and Sleep Draw warmth and light and life. REMEMBER. The swift hours fleet, the brief days steal the years, There seems scant space for laughter or for tears‚Äî Remember! The seasons press, Spring hastens, Summer flies, A flash, and Autumn fades in wintry skies‚Äî Remember! This truth alone, upon your soul keep graven, Beyond the imminent deep, there lies a haven For ever! Whither, unchecked by life's impatient surges A Power, a Hand, a Voice eternal urges For ever! There, comes not Time nor Change but Peace and Rest, And bless√®d Contemplation of the Best‚Äî Remember! A NEW ORPHIC HYMN. The peaks, and the starlit skies, the deeps of the fathomless seas, Immanent is He in all, yet higher and deeper than these. The heart, and the mind, and the soul, the thoughts and the yearnings of Man, Of His essence are one and all, and yet define it who can? The love of the Right, tho' cast down, the hate of victorious Ill, All are sparks from the central fire of a boundless beneficent Will. Oh, mystical secrets of Nature, great Universe undefined, Ye are part of the infinite work of a mighty ineffable Mind. Beyond your limitless Space, before your measureless Time, Ere Life or Death began was this changeless Essence sublime. In the core of eternal calm He dwelleth unmoved and alone 'Mid the Universe He has made, as a monarch upon his throne. And the self-same inscrutable Power which fashioned the sun and the star Is Lord of the feeble strength of the humblest creatures that are. The weak things that float or creep for their little life of a day, The weak souls that falter and faint, as feeble and futile as they; The malefic invisible atoms unmarked by man's purblind eye That beleaguer our House of Life, and compass us till we die; All these are parts of Him, the indivisible One, Who supports and illumines the many, Creation's Pillar and Sun! Yea, and far in the depths of Being, too dark for a mortal brain, Lurk His secrets of Evil and Wrong, His creatures of Death and of Pain. A viewless Necessity binds, a determinate Impetus drives To a hidden invisible goal the freightage of numberless lives. The waste, and the pain, and the wrong, the abysmal mysteries dim, Come not of themselves alone, but are seed and issue of Him. And Man's spirit that spends and is spent in mystical questionings, Oh, the depths of the fathomless deep, oh, the riddle and secret of things, And the voice through the darkness heard, and the rush of winnowing wings! ON A FLOCK OF BIRDS FLYING SOUTHWARD BY NIGHT. Above the silent fields and slumbering town, Fly onward, fearless wanderers, swiftly fly! Speed fast, speed far, nor ever settle down, Unmarked upon the starless midnight sky, Save where white breasts reflect the city's light, And from your rushing, pulsing squadrons high Comes a faint ghostly cry. Alas! for the sweet summer past and done, Again the cruel frozen north-wind blows, Fly southward, southward still pursue the sun Where by warm waves the crown√®d palm-tree grows. Leave care and toil and fret and murky air To us, who with the ever-darkening day, Chained fast must bear to stay. Fly on, fly fast, till with the tardy light A second Summer wakes the purple sea, And Winter flies, defeated with the night, Then gliding earthward, slowly, wearily, By some hushed Afric forest-depths profound, Or windless glare of some surf-beaten strand Greet the old Southern land. But oh! forget not 'neath that fuller sun, Our Northern Summer's shy reluctant grace, The white-robed Spring ere primrosetide is done, Blithe June or ruddy Autumn's sunburnt face, The flowery depths, the golden waves of wheat, The symphonies of faithful wedded song Piped gladly all day long. Here is your home and ours, where the young brood Were born, and essayed first their callow wings, Here, where laborious summers gained their food, And homely love despised all outer things. Here is full life, not there, though flower and fruit Unfading spring, and weal be yours and rest, The North still holds the nest. Here will we stay content, whose lot is cast Far in the wintry North, for hearth and home, And ye, too, when the frozen blasts are past, Again to this our well-loved land shall come. April shall come again, and bring with her New wholesome toils, and ye with northward wing Shall speed to meet the Spring. FOR A SCHOOL MAGAZINE. Blithe boyhood! shall a jaded Muse, A world-worn brain, The tribute of a song refuse Besought again? Long since to my own school I gave A humble lay, Mixt memories now gay, now grave, Of work and play. The reverend courts, the Minster grey, The curfew bell, Still though dim years have passed away, Remembered well. The panting chase, the flying ball, The tented plain, The plunge 'neath the warm wave recall Dead youth again. The happy task, that sweetened rest; The soul afire, The thirst to know, the unsated zest, For something higher. The wonder of discovered lore And wisdom old, Poet and sage with new-found store, Words, thoughts of gold, Visions of far-off precious things, Shy hopes of fame, Ambition, spreading soaring wings, Love's nascent flame. Ah me! how far they seem, and yet So strangely nigh, Age might its slower limbs forget, Its dimmer eye. Again the hopeful youthful heart Throbs high and fast, Again the joy, sometimes the smart Of the dead Past. Not only in old fanes and hearts, But ever new, Young schools, young lives with varied arts The Muse pursue. Pass on, swift generations pass Undaunted on, Each year spreads swifter wings, alas! Till all are gone. Soon gay youth, lost in manhood's prime, Shall fleet away, Recruit, refresh the waste of Time By healthful play! But think ye that the needed rest, The happier toil, To him alone are fully blest Who knows no soil. Nor let your faithful thought forget That work or rest, Him profit most whose soul is set To gain the best. FAITH. Oh Faith, that through our feeble youth, Our faltering footsteps didst sustain, With glimpses of receding Truth, Now seen and now withdrawn again; But always faint and white and far As stars in summer midnights are. Not Faith thou wert, if throughly clear, Thou shon'st upon us, ever bright, If thou like knowledge, steadfast, near, Wert bathed in all-pervading Light, And with high noon of perfect Day, Illumin'dst our unerring way. Not Faith thou wert! Ah, shine not bright, But as of old, o'erclouded still; Let no broad noontides blind our sight. With dawn, with eve, our spirits fill; Not all thy hidden rays reveal‚Äî To know is lower than to feel. BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA. November 9, 1897. In murky gloom, in petulant rain, Thick swathed our sordid London lay, White mists obscured the midland plain Thro' all the drear November day But with swift eve, the sinking sun Smote the Welsh hills, and suddenly Behold the reign of winter done, Once more the blue, unclouded sky. And with the dawn the impatient light Streams through the darkened cells of sleep, Till lo! full noontide broadening bright, Brings azure sky and sapphire deep. Oh joy, how beautiful a way My happy fate prepares for me, Who journey on this perfect day, Between the mountains and the sea. We leave behind the grey old town, The castle's flawless circuit tall, Thin turrets like a mural crown, Decking broad tower and frowning wall. The faint pyramidal peaks of Lleyn Rise sheer from out the encircling sea, The palaced groves of Anglesey Light the salt stream which flows between. Mo√´l and the great twin brethren high, Eryri, king of upper air, Soar on the clear autumnal sky, 'Mid thronging Titans everywhere. Unveiled from base to summit all Show russet fern and golden wood; Bare steep, and skyward-climbing wall; The fall that lights the solitude. The rock-senced fields, the wandering sheep Climbing the mountain's perilous brow, And sheltered by the quarried steep, Village and chapel far below. And see a dark procession come, Slow on the sunlit highway sped, Which bears to his eternal home, With hymns, some village worthy dead. And every word that you can hear, And all the sorrowful measures sung, Breathe the old Cymric spirit dear, Clothed in the old undying tongue. Turn from the mountains to the sea, The dark blue sea, where on the skies, Faint as a phantom isle might be, The hallowed heights of Bardsey rise. The calm sea ripples on the sand, The oft-vext deeps are lulled to rest, A soft breeze breathing from the land Dispels in mist each fairy crest. Long miles upon the giddy verge The swift train labours on its way, The white gulls swoop; from surge to surge The dusky cormorants dive and play. The stone-roofed, massive homesteads grey, The stacks by close-bound ropes confined, Tell of the coming wintry day Which wings with snow the whirling wind. The hills recede, till, lo! again, Perched high in air a tiny town, And stern above the lonely plain Harlech's unshattered ramparts frown. And then, again, a rival band Of giant mountains close the view, Cader, Arrenig, Aran stand Serrated, huge, against the blue. Last, thy sweet vale, Dolgelly! Where Is any fairer? Oak-crowned isle, Blue river, mounting woodsides fair, The golden haze, the unchanging smile. Not Como, nor Lugano hold Serener azure depths divine, Nor treasure of autumnal gold, Nor guardian summits vast as thine. Again a widespread estuary, And on the lone bird-haunted strand, The white-winged squadrons circling free, The land-locked pools, the ribbed sea-sand. Fair Mawddach's charm returns again, Sweet wandering Dovey, dost thou pour A lovelier tribute to the main, Than glides by Barmouth's sandy shore? Nay, nay! I fear to award the crown Of natural beauty; both are fair. Here the tall hills seem gentler grown, Here, richer meads, and softer air. Then comes once more the level plain, The sandy dunes, the half-hid blue, The sea-beat towns which woo the main, The academic towers which grew Swift as the Caliph's palace fair, On the loud verge; the chosen home Of those who hold the things that were, Less than the glory that shall come. And then by labouring gradients slow, Past park and hall, till ere the night Obscures the hills, and settles low On the loved vale, my straining sight Welcomes the homely scene; thy steep Grongar, long sacred to the Muse; Broad Towy winding to the deep; Llangunnor, with thy reverend yews. Here, though 'tis Life's November, still Are homely joys, and sunlit days, Blest memories haunt each modest hill, And wake the yearning soul to praise. AH! WAS IT I? Ah! was it I, who loved to spend, The long laborious Autumn day, Till the slow twilight neared its end, Content to chase, to wound, to slay; Who watched unmoved the victims die? Ah! was it I? And was it I, who flushed with pride, And insolence of swelling years, Faith's simple teachings would deride, Taking no heed for saintly tears, Who scorned the upward path to try? Ah! was it I? And was it I who saw the Light Fade at high noon and leave behind Dark spectres of a haunted night, Sick fancies of a clouded mind, Deep sloughs of sense, lusts of the eye? Ah! was it I? Yet was it I whom from life's dawn, Some ray of a diviner Sun, Some heavenly music far withdrawn, Compassed till perilous youth was done, Some soaring angel-fancies high? Ah! was it I? And was it I whose riper age Knew all the earlier visions fade, Dull silence quench youth's nobler rage, Blank solitudes myself had made, Hope, laughter, sinking to a sigh? Ah! was it I? Ay! it was I‚Äîthe pitiless child, The unfaithful youth, the man who saw With brain mature, and heart grown mild, The silent, sad, unbending Law! From change to change Life's seasons fly, Ay! it was I! THE EARTH'S EASTER-TIDE. Sing and rejoice, Soul of the world, sing on! Sing and be glad to-day! Thy Spring is come at length, thy winter gone, Vanished and chased away. Rise in white robes, leaving the tomb, the dead, Behold, the living Sun calls to thee overhead. Let the glad Earth her bosom deck with flowers, A bride with pure, calm eyes, Let the still sea reflect the cloudless skies, To-day deep joy is ours, The Spring-tide of the Soul at last is born, Our Hope is risen, is risen, this is our Easter morn. Exult, oh heart. Rejoice, oh Soul, rejoice, Thy Hope is risen to-day, Let all things living lift a cheerful voice, Thy Hope is risen to-day. No more Death bounds our lives with hopeless pain, Our Sun is risen indeed! He lives and reigns again! T√ÜDIUM VIT√Ü. Weary of life! Ah! wherefore live If Age and Suffering rack the frame, If Pleasure holds no gain to give, If Honours pall and with them Fame; If Riches fly and Love be gone, Nor ray of sunshine gild the gloom, Why linger miserably on, Why longer cheat the open tomb? But Pain may cease and Time bring Health, And rising Hope expel Despair, Again the golden glow of wealth May rout the gathered clouds of care. Not these, the pains which breed disgust Of living, but the ingratitude, Of child or friend, the shattered trust, The links once broken ne'er renewed. The Faith once living drowned and dead, Too long on life's dark waters tost, The glory dimmed, the vision fled, The inner voices mute and lost. These leave us, lonely, desolate, Bankrupt of hope, and love, and friend, With nothing from the wreck of Fate But one dull longing for the End. THE MARCH OF MAN. Man that is born of a Woman the pride and the shame of Creation; Man that soars upward to Heaven, and sinks to the nethermost Hell; Man that is lower than the brute and yet higher in rank than the Angels; Man with vile lusts that dishonour, and yearnings that soar to the skies; That can die for the Truth‚Äîay, in torture; that wallows in sensual pleasures; And is drowned in fathomless sloughs and abysses of shameful desire; That is full of compassion and pity and ruth for his suffering brethren; That robs and tortures and slays, defacing the image of God. Dark riddle unsolved, dumb Sphinx, with a twofold nature eternal, That speaks no word though the ages fleet by on invisible wings Unaltered, though diverse in faith and in race, for good or for evil; High in knowledge, buried in ignorance, always unchangeably, Man. Thee I sing, and thine is the Hymn that I essay with accents unworthy, Thy high glory, thy deep disgrace, the crown of the world and its shame! Ah! Heaven, through what √¶ons unnumbered thou wert, while the fires of Creation Burned fierce, and the earth and the sea still seethed in a tropical haze. Monstrous growths in the ooze or the jungle, or cleaving the ill-defined √¶ther, Mailed dreadfully, rending talons, fangs horrible, cavernous jaws! What power was it strengthened thy arm in a world of rapine and slaughter? What steeled thy spirit undaunted 'mid terrors by night and by day? What else than the force which compelled thy isolate units together As never the brute was drawn, for mutual solace and aid. Long ages of suffering were thine, unarmed 'mid a monstrous creation, Hidden deep in the caves of the rocks, by the fear of thy ravening foes, Till the sure blight came with the years on that primal order gigantic, And the mailed monsters dwindled and failed from the temperate ocean and earth. Then fighting for food, men with men, while the slow-fashioned flint-heads prim√¶val That had pierced thro' the mastodon's mail, were reddened with fratricide blood, Till at last the faint language of signs, in a dumb world vacant of reason Grew slowly through age-long degrees, to the ultimate wonder of speech. Yet amid all the bloodshed and terror, the famine and nakedness always, Were the Father's and Mother's love, and the innocent smile of the child. Oh ages, known only to God! Oh dim generations forgotten! Of like nature were ye with our own, of like passions, glory and shame. Thus through ages and ages of Time marched the long successions unending, The hunter, the fisher waxed skilful through sad generations of men, Step by step came new powers and new arts, and o'er all the Creation dominion, And man graved on the mastodon's tusk the first faint beginnings of Art. Fire came from the Sun, or the storm-cloud, and with it the forging of metals; No more the savage tears raw, the blood-stained flesh of his prey, But with hatchet of bronze levels slowly the broad-leaved trees of the forest, And builds him a hut to escape from the sun, and the snow and the rain. Then sews him a garment of skins to ward off the rigour of winter, And the hearth gives comfort and light through the dark and desolate hours; The husbandman tills the earth with rude shares of newly forged iron, And sows with each coming of Spring hoarded treasures of life-bearing grain; Silent ages! but always the gains of the long Past harvested safely, Gathered little by little, at length, brought the triumph of conquering Man! And last, through a rift in the clouds, like the blessed Sun seen and then hidden, There dawns on Man's upturned vision some broken image of God; Obscured by vague terrors as yet, bloody rites and foul superstitions, Yet holding within it the power to raise up the man from the brute. Then after long √¶ons of pain, step by step, the savage ascending, The scattered huts grew to the village, and then to the wall-circled town, Strong towers with rampart and moat, the hut giving place to the palace, Halls of marble, long colonnades, and ceilings fretted with gold, The pride of the races that lived their forgotten histories vanished, The gains of the Empires unsung, whose speech and whose records were dead, Ere the black-bearded kings from their chariots pursued the pitiful thousands, Or transfixed the pard or the lion with shafts from the merciless bow. Or who by the mystical Nile, grave, priest-like, Lords of the Bondsmen, Swayed through long dynasties dim the voiceless bewildering years‚Äî; Those whose name and whose fame together have perished, older than legend, Whose ruins, the sand or the forest hides deep in its silence profound. Perished! gone! clean-forgotten of men! but surely repeating for ever Man's story of life and endeavour, and conquest, and failure, and death. Age upon age passed away, and the graven records unfading Were carved no more on the rocks, but writ on the tablets of mind; The glory of Greece shone forth, the sage, the hero, the poet, The lips of Wisdom were touched with a new-born sweetness and fire, The painter, the sculptor revered the perfect half-divine body, And saw through the veil of the flesh, the immanent Godhead displayed. The Godlike was clothed with life by the voice of the sage, of the minstrel, Half-divine show the heroes immortal who fought in the fabulous Troy‚Äî Oh, fair blossom of Man's young summer, oh, glory and radiance departed, Oh, white lily springing from mire too foul for the savage to-day. Then, the blossom of Beauty past, from strong roots far reaching ascended A gnarled tree of secular strength, the o'ershadowing greatness of Rome; Not Beauty, but Law with Might, Titanic, disciplined, fearless, Wearing down the pride of the Strong, but sparing the weak and cast-down. Beneath that strong Law universal, man faded, and manacled Freedom Grew faint, and withered and sank 'neath the blight of a cankering peace, Till law fell, trampled down in the dust by the feet of the tyrannous C√¶sars, And only a phantom remained of the power, and the glory of old, And in deep sloughs of sense and of blood, unredeemed by the Beauty of Hellas, Sank the rugged manhood and stern of the legions that conquered the world; And not even the new-born Dawn proclaiming its heavenly message, Which shone forth, from dying Jud√¶a, could pierce the thick gathering gloom‚Äî; The West paused long on its march, the weary Orient slumbered, No ears had Mankind to hear, the Word that was sent for their Peace. Then there rushed from the ends of the Earth, horde on horde, invincible, awful, On the shame of a moribund world, the unnumbered avengers of blood, And the heart of the giant was pierced and the shattered idol fell earthward, And the prisoners of Time were set free, and Mankind delivered from Rome. Then ages on ages of blood that cleansed the dark stains of Man's story, And again the tired world awoke in the light of a long-deferred day, And the hope of the Race sheltered safe, in the sacred hush of the Cloister, Keeping some faint glimmer alight in a world whereof Darkness was King. And each century added new rays, till at length from slumber awaking, The mighty West leapt to its feet, and again was Humanity free; A new breath breathed on the Race and the swift generations sped onward, Adding each some laborious gift to the sum of the gains of the whole. Still the long processions speed onward, and still each man in his station, Brings his loyal oblation of work to lay on the altar of Good, Busy toilers of wider view, a great army of seekers devoted, O'er all the wide kingdom of knowledge spread tireless and thirsting to know; Weigh the Sun and the Stars in the scales, scan the uttermost heaven and discover The long-locked wandering star whose vast orbit brings it again; Can predict its return ages hence though no eye now living shall see it, And conjecture on faint far planets the work of intelligent hands; Who with re-inforced vision explore the invisible hidden Creation, The death-dealing germs of Disease, the secrets of Life and of Death; Who imprison and guide at their pleasure the nameless force of the lightning, Till it conquers the darkness of Night, or whirls them o'er sea and o'er land, Who shall make them a way through the air, leaving cloud and tempest beneath them, Till the ends of the earth are linked fast in a holy communion of Peace; Who shall learn by the power of just laws to raise up the down-trodden thousands, Till Nature's unequal gifts are redressed by the wisdom of men. Bring new fire, oh Promethean Science! rise higher, oh glorified Manhood! Till thou gain to full knowledge at last of the infinite purpose of God! But can this be the cave-man of old, the naked savage prim√¶val, Hiding deep in the depths of the rocks from the winged Lizard's pitiless jaw? Wondrous gain! but broken too oft by reversals and degenerations, Not always the secular march lay onward and upward to Light, The old Empires faded and sank leaving naught but some ruins Cyclopic Buried deep in the sands, or o'ergrown in the twilight of tropical woods. The Temples, the altars are gone, the tall carven columns lie prostrate, Gods and men lie buried together; dumb histories, glory, and shame, All are gone, and the peasant who delves 'mid the shapeless mounds starts to discover Deep hidden, the gold and the gems of the ghosts of a sepulchred Past. Still over the populous East, crude beliefs, thin philosophies, changeless From the first beginnings of Time, clog millions of wandering feet, And the naked savage obscene, fetish-ridden, unreasoning, brute-like Gibbers still with faint jargons of speech through the limitless wastes of the South. Shall we hold with more credulous souls the faith in a purpose Eternal, Marching on without haste or delay to the final triumph of Good? Yea, the great Scheme fulfils itself always, though slowly with long intermissions, Wave on wave of the inflowing tide seems at times to ebb back to the sea; Where to-day are the wonders of Painting, the breathing Marbles immortal, The floreate capitals carven, the vaulted, vaporous aisles? The skill of the craftsmen who reared the huge bulk of structures colossal, The lost Arts, and triumphs of Knowledge, the hidden Arcana of Faith? A great silence swallows them all, they have perished, and no man remembers, And the gains of the Past are re-won after ages of travail and tears. Man that cowered long time in the caves, scant in numbers, feeble, forgotten, Is the crown and summit of things, and has filled and governs the world, But not yet can he govern his soul; gross desires, mean ideals, enslave him; Not wherefore he came nor whence, nor whither he goeth he knows. Life's swift fleeting seasons perplex him, youth passes, dull age creeps upon him. Few are blest, while the multitudes labour through brief lives and fortunes forlorn, To the grave from the cradle they bear, the unsatisfied dim generations, Toil and suffering, hunger and cold, scant pleasure and undeserved pain, The shadow of fratricide war, broods deep o'er the shuddering peoples, And the round world rolls on through cycles of sorrow, and bloodshed, and pain. Nay, oh man, though vainly it seem, still aspire, struggle onward and upward! In the Future live, not the Past, trample down the inherited brute! Rise from sensual deeps, rise upward. He who made thee knows to what purpose, Spurn aside, one by one, with the years, the sordid rags of the Past. Give ear to the clear voice calling with mystical accents unceasing, That bids thee aspire and ascend in the faith of an ultimate Good. Not for thee are the problems perplext of the methods and ends of the Maker, Turn with steadfast unwavering gaze to the Light of the half-discerned Sun; Tread down in the mire of dead years the reproach of the travailing ages, Raise the wandering savage alike, and the waifs of the sin-laden streets; The ruffian, the wanton, the thief, the bondsmen of Pleasure or Mammon, Wasting weariful lives in the chase of ignoble profitless ends. Last of all make the Demon of War put off his false halo of Glory, And a league of Brethren conspire for the final triumph of Peace, Till the calm voice of Justice shall drown the cries of tumultuous Passion, And the criminal shrink from himself at the clear call of Godhead within; Then, O Man that art born of a Woman, the crown, not the shame of Creation, Be thou filled with the glory of God, as the waters cover the Deep! THE FREEING OF CRETE. At length! at last! at last! The weary suffering years are past! Baffled the tigerish Turk slinks from his bleeding prey. At last! O hapless Isle, at last! Thy mother draws thee closer to her breast, Thou, who long ages this auspicious day Awaitedst, but in vain, Done is at length, thy age-long pain, And thou at last, at rest! Strange are the ironies of Time and Fate, And dark the pathway of the Eternal feet, For lo, it was but yesterday that we, We whose hearts yearned to set the captive free, Knowing the story of thy misery, Waited the Hellenic victories in vain. Ah me! it was a time of pain For us, who from our earliest boyish years, With thee were nourished at one mother's breast!‚Äî Her brave sons, fearless, dashed their lives in vain Against the foemen's strong o'ermastering line, By alien hirelings drilled for victory. Oh wasted harvest-fields of Thessaly, On which divine Olympus looking, saw The brute invader trampling Right and Law, And weak defenders dying but in vain! Ah me! it was a time of tears, Blank disappointment sinking to despair, Almost our sad eyes seemed to see The loathly Ottoman once more again Befoul the city of the violet-crown; Loud shrieks of outrage on the affrighted air, Column again and temple crashing down, Barbarian vengeance wreaked on all things fair. Ah me! it was a time of pain and tears. But now! but now! though scarce a year has gone, To her high goal our Hellas marches on! The jealous Powers their mutual hates forget, And suddenly from failure, from defeat, She springs unconquered yet. From clouds and darkness beams her rising sun, A miracle, a miracle is done! In full accord the o'ermastering navies ride, To work the will of Europe side by side, And Peace accomplishes what War denied‚Äî The net is broken and the captive free! The sufferings of the dead unhappy Past, The wrongs, the tyrannies are fled at last. ‚ÄúBegone!‚Äù the banded Admirals cried, ‚ÄúBegone!‚Äù And without stroke of sword or flash of gun The Oppressor slunk away, his rule of Evil done. Therefore we sing to-day ‚ÄúTe Deum‚Äù for the victory of Peace; O Power of Good, at last make Wrong to cease! We, whose brave sons have died, and not in vain, In treacherous massacre, with torture slain, To free our Hellas; we, Whose England is the mother of all the Free, We praise thee, and we pray, Deliver soon the shining Company That stud the purple of the √Ügean sea; The land of Philip's conquering son; The rock-built islet of the blind old man, King of all Singers still; fair regions long, Shrined in our English Poet's generous song, Where long unchecked the spoiler loved to slay, And rob and ravish, as he would to-day. Bind in close union all who love to speak The sacred accents of the Greek; Till at the last the victory won, Hellas regains her children one by one! Deliver all, dread Power! and set them free From the foul Turk's decrepit tyranny! And ye, O new-born freemen brave, Put off the ignoble vices of the slave, Forget the faults which long oppression breeds, The feuds, the jealousies of warring creeds. Be love your guide, not hate, Not for yourselves take heed but for the State, Forget the Past, till a pervading Peace Shall bind you fast to Greece. Then ye, oh triple peaks of virgin snow, Which on the warring strifes and woes below, Looked down unmoved through the sad centuries Ere Homer sang, no more again shall see The secular misery; The hamlet flaring from the smoke's black shroud, The huddled flocks, and herds, the affrighted crowd; But smile upon the untroubled, peaceful plain, Where labour reaps its due; the untrampled grain, The unrifled olive, and the laden vine; On corn and oil and wine, And on the rippling breadths of purple sea, Lit by white wings of many an argosy, In the great Peace and Concord that shall be! CHRISTMAS, 1898. Another Century dies, In war and blood and pain, Our longing, streaming eyes Look forth for Peace in vain, For Christ the myriads fall Butchered by Turk or Kurd Comes there no end? Is all The hope of men in vain? Comes not the Lord again O'er all the Earth to reign As spake the Word? Slow are God's judgments, slow, To Man's impatient thought, Slow-paced the Ages grow, In vain the goal is sought. Armed to the teeth to-day The jealous peoples stand; Worse blight than of decay, Worse burden than of war The fleets and legions are; Dumb terror spreading far O'er sea and land! 'Tis nigh two thousand years, Since came the Prince of Peace Return Thou, calm our fears, Make strife and war to cease; Thick clouds to-day of doubt, Obscure our faithful sight. Shine, Blessed Sun, shine out, The storms of Passion still, Again, oh hidden Will, The wintry Earth fulfil With Peace and Light! CHRISTMAS, 1899. ‚ÄúMoriluri te salutant!‚Äù The din of the battlefield dies, The shouts of the foemen are still, No more from the deep-trench√®d hill The murderous battle-bolt flies. Here, alone 'mid the silent slain, Alone with no comforter nigh, Too feeble for fear or for pain, 'Neath strange stars in the pitiless sky, I make ready to die. Here soon with the dawn's dim light, Or may be in the lantern-lit dark, They will find me stretched cold and stark, A soldier who died in the night. Is it I who lie helpless here, I, Who this morning went pulsing with life To drink the delight of the strife? I, whose life ebbs away as I lie, Making ready to die? 'Tis Christmas-tide over the Earth, And thro' all our dear England to-night, Hearths glow ruddy and hearts young and old are light For joy of that marvellous birth. Ah! if only some vision might come Of the dear ones my eyes cannot see! If some token of love might be wafted to me From the silent lips in the well-loved home, Ere my time comes to die! Heaven! What is this comforting hand Which touches my fast-closing eyes, This Presence which opens a door in the skies, Where all my belov√®d stand? See, see 'tis my mother's kind face! Smiling grave 'neath her silvery hair, And my dearest love bending beside her chair! And my children's careless innocent grace, All are here, as I lie. They are joyous, dear children, at play, With the spoils of the old Christmas tree, Heaven keep them from hurt and calamity free, Till their sunny locks are grey. My brave boy has his sword and his gun, Like the soldier he wearies to be, Can I wish for him more when his life is done Than to fall for our England, if need shall be, And die happy like me? Thank Heaven for the vision! My heart Beats high for a moment still, As when we charged swift up this death-dealing hill Each man striving to do his part. I am troubled no longer, but lie Happy, thinking of hearth and of home, I rejoice that my dear ones were given to come, I grow faint, 'tis the end, I am ready to die, O belov√®d, O England, good-bye! ON AN EMPTY HOUSE. A stately house I passed to-day, Familiar when the world was gay. How the years fleeting take our lives! Nought of that joyous Past survives. Blind casements, railings red with rust, Dumb doorways choked with leaves and dust, And see! the staring placard cold‚Äî ‚ÄúThis noble mansion to be sold.‚Äù Nigh thirty years have passed away Since each year passing bloomed in May; Nigh thirty years, since side by side, The youthful bridegroom and his bride Passed careless through that lofty door, Where now their feet shall come no more. All splendours that to wealth belong Were theirs of feast and dance and song, The gliding lamps that choked the street, The thunder of high-stepping feet; The lights, the liveried crowd without, The wafted strains, the linkmen's shout; The jewelled throng that scaled the stair; The star-decked Great, the white-robed Fair; And when the whirling town grew still, Grey on the sunny oak-crowned hill, The gabled grange, amid the fern; Last, ere the sere leaves ceased to burn, The swallow-flights to chase the sun. Spring blossoms, bright ere Yule was done, And by the purple waters calm, The palace gleaming thro' the palm. Nigh thirty happy tranquil years, Child-voices, homely hopes and fears; Young girls, springing sweet and good From infancy to maidenhood. Soon joyous bridals, year by year Unbroken welfare, scarce a tear, Only the bright home stiller grown When half the nestling brood had flown. Last, ere chill age o'ertook them, then, Such is the lot of mortal men, The pitiless call too early come, To break the tranquil hush of home, The fair wife summoned first, then he, The sad sire fading gradually. And so the end; the nest grown cold, The orphaned lives I know not where; Blind casements, dust, and everywhere, Dim on the dense autumnal air, Time's epitaph on Rank and Gold‚Äî ‚ÄúThis noble mansion to be sold.‚Äù LIFE-MUSIC. Sound, jocund strains; on pipe and viol sound, Young voices sing; Wreathe every door with snow-white garlands round, For lo! 'tis Spring! Winter has passed with its sad funeral train, And hope revives again. Blow high, blow loud upon the wreath√®d horn, Sound joy-bells deep! Green-kirtled summer walks through vines and corn, The fenced fields sleep; The first flowers fade, the green fruits swell, and yet Fruition brings regret. Lift joyous harvest-music mellow notes With merry tunes! Raise thankful p√¶ans loud from manly throats, Trumpets, bassoons! Autumn has left red fruits and garnered gold, With dawns and twilights cold. Yet cease not from the use of solemn song, When the streams freeze; For dark brief days and rayless nights and long, For leafless trees! Each season should its proper music bring, Sweet as the songs of Spring. IN MEMORY OF TWO FRIENDS. I. Gwalchmai. Again the oft-renewed request, With time more frequent, to rehearse In some brief page of halting verse The praise of Cymry gone to rest. Thou good grey head, whose long life spread O'er all this fateful century, Now thou hast joined the faithful dead, I bring a wreath of praise for thee. In many a thronged pavilion fair Thy thin bent form, these eyes have seen, Thy medalled breast, thy silvery hair, Thy clear, calm gaze, thy brow serene. Oft have I marked thy accents weak Amid the hushed, attentive throng, In volleying swift Englynion speak What time they chaired the Bard of Song. Thyself an oft-crowned Bard, whose Muse To th' old alliterate measures sweet Her voice inspired, did ne'er refuse, But lightlier tripped for fettered feet. Nor thus alone, but long time stirred The passionate, yearning Cymric heart To choose the higher, better part, By preaching of the Eternal Word. So may it be till time is done! Two Powers for Good of differing name There are, in noble aim the same‚Äî God's Preacher and His Bard are one. Dear silent Bard, of kindred blood, With mine from Mona's wind-swept shore, I praise thy song, thy work for good, 'Tis only here thou sing'st no more. II. T. Ll. T. Good Friend, whose heart, whose Muse refined, Were to our Isis faithful yet, I praise thee with a willing mind Ere the world hastens to forget. Thou as befits our tuneful race Wert touched in youth with Bardic fire, The Cymric melody and grace Thy young ambition did inspire. Long since in thy successful song The Toiler's praise thou didst rehearse, Winning by sympathetic verse The plaudits of the lettered throng. Fair gift by work's unchanging round Thro' all thy later years represt; Thou hidd'st, by lifelong fetters bound, The fire scarce kindled in thy breast. And better thus maybe to bear Duty's dull burden to the end, The Teacher's crown of work to wear That in each Learner gains a friend. Beside life's duteous liturgies What profits rank or wealth or name? A brighter lustre shines on these Than on the pinnacles of Fame. Far better to have won the love By faithful work, of old and young, Than the admiring throng to move By song as sweet as Bard has sung. So I who knew thee well and long, I whose sole gift it is to sing, To these memorial pages bring This votive wreath of musing song. ON A SCULPTOR WHO DIED YOUNG. J. Milo Griffith. Obiit. Sept. 1897. Art smiled on him, but one unchanging frown For all his days would churlish Fortune keep; Too soon we deemed he laid life's burden down. Nay! for He giveth His beloved sleep! VER NON SEMPER VIRET. Oh the blithe spring weaves a maze of flowers till come the glad Midsummer hours When the sun is shining, shining, Dawn and Sunset in the skies; Yet tho' song and youth are every-where, upon the joyous lightsome air, A cold voice sighs. ‚ÄúThere shall come a fated end of all, ere Autumn's leaves have ceased to fall, And thro' all the sleeping woods there sounds no trill of waking bird, And a great hush steals away the joys of youth and all its merry noise, And song-tide dies.‚Äù Silent yet tolling, tolling deep, like wizard voices heard in sleep, The strange sound eddies ceaseless, like a whirlpool round the soul, There is silence all-pervading; voiceless echoes sinking, fading While the still deeps roll. And anon a ghostly pealing, on the slumbering senses stealing, Life's high, soaring accents hushing, to an undertone of pain; Soar, oh Love-strains, high and higher, like a fountain, like a fire, Youth is not in vain. Drown the dismal, deathlike measure, in loud canticles of pleasure, Joy of youth, and joy of living, let your blithest songs be sung, For though Age with Death conspire, to-day the sun mounts high and higher, And the world is young. ON A MEMORIAL ORGAN. His life made music sweeter far than sound, Here would we keep some echoes that were his, Who, with the choir invisible around, Now hearkens to the Eternal Harmonies. THE DIAMOND JUBILEE. An Ode. June 20, 1897. Rejoice, give thanks for all the centuries, Since first our little island's crescent story, A feeble radiance woke the waning skies, To shine in full-orbed glory. Twelve centuries ago our Britain rose, Girt round by watchful foes, And did prevail at last‚Äîsuch power in valour lies, Such force the brain, the arm of Freedom fires, Such lofty thought her soul inspires, Her's were the faults, the virtues of the strong, The passionate love of Right, the burning hate of Wrong, Warped sometimes by her too imperious will, To thoughts, to deeds of ill, But hearing still through all, the voice of Fate, Proclaim, ‚ÄúThou shalt be great!‚Äù Mixed is the journey of a nation's life, Through frowning mountain-pass and flowery plain, Through peaceful halcyon days, rude storms of cruel strife, Brief pleasure, longer pain. But not in vain has our dear Britain been. Oh gracious Island Queen, Mother of freemen! over all the earth, Thy Empire-children come to birth, Vast continents are thine or sprung from thee, Brave island-fortress of the storm-vext sea! The giant common wealths which sway the West, Were nourished at thy breast; The fair-grown sisters of the Austral main That hold the South in fee, Are thine, and love thy laws and speak thy tongue; The dusky millions of thy fabulous East, Dim Empires older than the dawn of Time; Thy crescent realm on Afric's peopled shore, The white man's grave no more; Ruled by just laws, and learning to grow free, Rejoice by thy Britannic Peace in creased. Thy praise is by a myriad voices sung; Thou treadst alone thy onward path sublime: Thou hast not been in vain! Great Empire, those who come to-day from far, Seeking some symbol of our common love, Know through their souls Imperial pulses move, Following as did the Magi once, the Star Of this new birth of Time, this happy reign! Ne'er in our Crowned Republic's story yet, Of all that men remember or forget, This strange, this precious thing has been: No reign of threescore years of King or Queen Our annals hold‚Äîtill in this waning age, Time's finger writes it on the storied page. This is the golden link which binds in one All British hearts beneath the circling Sun, And this the Star which draws all, far and near, This aged life and dear! Ah, honoured thin-drawn life! who long hast borne From that far June, when with the earliest morn The young maid woke with tears, And innocent childish fears, The heavy burden of the Imperial Crown, Thy young, thy aged temples pressing down; Who threescore years throned in the nation's heart, Of all joys and sorrows, barest part, Sharing thy people's humbler hopes and fears, And oft directing through a mist of tears Our difficult way,‚Äîso fragile yet so strong! Thou seemest to our eyes Our own embodied Britain, old yet young; Not the rude Britain of her arrogant youth, But loving peace, and filled with gentle ruth, The Britain, her undying bards have sung. Our lives are bound with thine, our hopes with thee, Thy subjects all, and loyal lovers, we Come from the North, the South, the East, the West; From the acclaiming lands beyond the foam, Seeking their ancient unforgotten home, Differing in race and tongue, and creed and name‚Äî Senators, soldiers, rulers great in fame, Thy proud Proconsuls come; Down lanes of life the slow processions stream, Barbaric gold and sunlit pennons gleam, While all the glittering palace-balconies, Are animate with bright patrician eyes‚Äî And from our mighty mother, and the hum Of labour-teeming towns, from mine and loom, And the blurred forge's mingled glow and gloom, Throngs the unnumbered league-long crowd, Waiting with-yearning hearts and plaudits loud, To see along the fluttering flower-hung street, With trumpet-blare and measured martial feet, Down clear perspectives of the sunlit ways The jewelled pageant pass to prayer and praise, For blessings that have been, and peace, and length of days. This pomp makes History. Long years to be, When all our brave Victorian company Beyond the circuits of the stars has gone, The echoes of this memorable day, Not wholly dumb, nor fled away, Shall still go widening, widening on, Till Britain with new fires of Union glow. Not as the Roman, triumphing of yore‚Äî The slave, the doomed, behind, the conqueror, before‚Äî Our peaceful pageants show; Whereto each daughter-state or subject-race, Brings its own native pride and grace. For Union 'tis our severed peoples cry, For Peace each neighbour-realm, each proud ally! Princes and Peoples join alike to pay, Due reverence to a Woman's blameless sway, And bless with heart and voice this fair auspicious day. RENEWAL. Draw near, draw near, Oh blithe and glad New Year, Haste, haste our weary souls to cheer, Draw swiftly near, Bidding farewell to pain and fear, And sullen Winter's frown, and ready tear, Bright hopes and far horizons clear. Draw near, draw near, Let ageworn Wisdom hide her wrinkled front severe. Wake, wake again Beneath the genial rain, Pathetic vernal fancies vain! Come Spring again! Weave thy old flowery chain Round Youth's strong pulse and throbbing brain, While Love and Hope remain, And Life is mixt of Joy and pain. Blossom again! Trip by swift, nimble Hours, with Summer in your train! TERRA DOMUS. Above the deep-set valley The mountain-ranges rise; Above the clouded summits, The boundless skies. Beyond the crested surges, Broad plains of ocean are, Beyond the dim horizons The evening star. Beyond, above the limits Of toil and pain and strife, Gleams like a fitful beacon The blessed life. Beyond Earth's quick mutations, Bright hopes and glooms of fear‚Äî Ah! but high heaven affrights us, Our home is here! A GEORGIAN ROMANCE. A.D. 1900. ‚ÄúThink you that after nineteen centuries Since shone our Hope on earth, there come to-day No tragedies, no dread abysmal deeps Of sin, like those of old, the accursed house Of Atreus, or the fratricides of Thebes, Or those the shame of medi√¶val Rome, The Borgias, or the Cenci, or the rest? Nay, nay, the same infernal forces still Assault men's shuddering souls; amid the glare Of all our vaunted gains dark growths obscene Tower high as then‚Äîhot passion quenched in blood‚Äî Lust, incest, fratricide,‚Äîthese vex us still, As erst in Thebes or Rome, no fabled tales Are ours, but, dreadful fact, murders as fierce And deadly as of old; the Church may preach Her sacred message; the philosopher, All brain, but little heart, may boast in vain Mind's victories; for still Tartarean fires Rage close beneath the surface scarce concealed, And whoso stumbles, burns. Deliver us, O Power of Good, for 'tis a hopeless world!‚Äù These dark thoughts held me, as I mused perplext, This very spring, reading the dreadful tale, The morning's broadsheet See the Daily News, February 15, 1900. brought, and seemed to gaze, On the blue waters of the Euxine sea, By bright Odessa, while a fettered crew Of convicts whom the inexorable Law Banished to far Saghalien, shambled by Dragging their chains; vile faces, seared and marred, Doomed for long painful years to fruitless toil Deep in the sunless mine, till youth and hope Lay dead, and only some poor wreck remained Of what long since was man‚Äîall, young and old, Chained each to each, in convict garb, all sign Of rank and gentle breeding sunk and lost In fellowship of crime. The wretches filed To where the black side of the impatient ship Swallowed them one by one. But as they passed In pitiful procession to their fate One my eye noted, tall, who walked alone In bloom of manhood, proud with steadfast eyes, Whom not the shameful garb, nor clanking chain Nor manacled hands, nor vile companionship Could quite disguise or mar. Seeing him pass I seemed to ask the warder of his name, But that he knew not, nor his rank, but only That he was called ‚ÄúPrince Ivan.‚Äù Then I seemed To question the lost wretch, and hear him tell In gentle tones this dreadful tale of wrong. ‚ÄúWhat, would you know what brings me here? Good friend, For in your eyes I see a pitying gleam, 'Twere better not to hear it, for, God wot, Sometimes I wonder if 'twas I indeed Who sinned, or if some dread necessity Worked through me, as the sculptor's hand which moulds White marble, or the painter's who draws forth Dark fancies from the canvas, till behold! A fiend, not man. I do not seek to hide My wickedness, but sometimes am perplexed To know by what gradations swift or slow What I was once was changed to what I am. I well remember how I read in youth The tales of ancient crime, nor ever dreamt That e'er they might be mine; but now I go To pay its penalty, a felon, lost, Degraded from my rank, doomed for long years To slave without reward or hope; to miss All things that make life sweet‚Äîthough nought indeed Could sweeten mine‚Äîyet to live hopeless on Without the power to end it. I was born Amid the Georgian snows, of an old race, And puissant, ere the wily Russian stole Our land and freedom from us; a chaste youth I spent among our mountains. My good sire Died first, and then my mother. My dear brother, Filling my father's place and rank, remained Unwedded, keeping sole the ancestral state Of our old home; but me a boy as yet He tended like a father, till the time When to our Northern City of the Snows I went to gain such knowledge as became My rank and birth. Dear brother, who didst lavish Thy love and care on me; in that blest sphere Where now thou art, freed from this load of life, Forgive me if thou canst my dreadful wrong, Or if thou fail, forget it! The swift years Fled by and left me man, and brought with them Such gains of knowledge as my studious youth Untouched, or but a little, by grosser sense Or careless pleasures of the idle great, Prized above all. 'Mid those gay crowds I kept Dear memories of the old ancestral halls, The high Caucasian peaks, the snow-fed streams, Long left but unforgotten, the brisk air Breathed 'mid the trackless pinewoods of my home. All these preserved my youth and kept it pure, Till last, treading the paths of sober love, I wooed the daughter of a noble house And won her, and I thought I loved her well. Ah me! that I had known what 'twas to love! Not with blind passion, but with tempered glow Of moderate fervour, such as lights and warms Thousands of happier souls who live calm lives In uneventful wedlock till the end, Nor dream that they are loveless. Ere we reached The goal of marriage, since the unfailing use Of noble houses when their scions wed Divides the ancestral lands, I, with what joy! Forsook the noisy city for a while For my dear native hills. My brother wrote To bid me welcome. He, too, now was wed ‚ÄòTo a wife the pearl of women, beautiful As Venus' self, as soon my eyes should see.‚Äô ‚ÄòCome,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòbrother, all I wish for you Is that your wife be true and fair as mine.‚Äô And then I left the murky city and sped Swiftly across the interminable plains To the dear hills. Ah me! 'tis three brief years, No more, but since that day what things have been‚Äî All dead! and by whose fault? All dead! but I, Who come once more to meet the summer sun, Banished, degraded, chained, whom all men shun, Doomed to a death in life, far worse than death, A monster and accurst. But when I gained the well-remembered hills, No warning voice proclaimed what things should be, The weird old towers, the old familiar fields Showed nought of new, since I a budding youth Left, who returned a man. There seemed no change In any save in me, if there indeed, Seeing that the old loved scenes, the eager air, Stripped from me all the dusty past, and clothed My life with a new boyhood. At the gate My brother waited with a warm embrace Of welcome. The brief winters which had passed Since last we met had left scant trace on him; Only a broader brow, a form which showed More stalwart than before; he past was dead, The past was gone, and I a boy again, O'erjoyed with all I saw. And then I raised My eyes, and of a sudden knew my doom! For there within the entrance stood revealed The woman of my dreams. Of stately mine As 'twere a Goddess; the dark lustrous eyes Of Georgia, the divine Caucasian charm Which makes our women, fairer, comelier far Than all the world can match. On the sweet lips A smile of welcome for the stranger made My heart throb high; something I seemed to gain, I never knew before, as if my life Had found its complement, the half the gods Of fable kept when half was given. Deep awe Chilled me as who at midnight calls his name And lo! the answering spirit of himself; Or as the hapless hunter when he spied The Goddess disarrayed; while from her eyes Shot a swift answering gleam, half joy, half pain, Proving a mutual wound. I found no word Of greeting, when my brother's kindly voice Made known to me my sister.‚Äî‚ÄòSister,‚Äô said he?‚Äî Ah, nearer, dearer far than any tie Of common blood. Yet fenced by equal bars From honourable love. What need to tell The dreadful tale? The hidden fatal fire Repressed in vain, tho' by no word declared, Nor guilty save in thought, grew every day Stronger and dreadfuller. Day after day I dallied with my fetters, knowing well That safety lay in flight; until at last I lost the wish to fly. Then one sad night, Despite our wills, despite our shrinking hearts, The fire long smouldering leapt in sudden flame, Scorning restraint, and mounting terribly, Consumed the bars of honour, duty, faith, And left our lives in ashes. When 'twas done And the long struggle ceased, we knew some ghost Of happiness, though haunted by the dread Of imminent ill. Ah me! when I recall Those guilty days, compared with what should come, They show like heavenly glimpses; yet were they The cause of all. Day after day the thought Of what discovery brought with it, mixed sweet With bitter, hardly as I think the sense Of wickedness oppressed us, we had found Some poisonous anodyne to blunt the qualm Of conscience, and despite our constant fear Not less 'twas sweet to sin. This is the bribe The Tempter offers, this the fatal net He spreads for souls, and damns them, and I durst not Break it, nor would, though now the fleeting weeks Flew onward to my marriage; and my bride Who should be soon, wrote lovingly, and fain Would hasten my return; but still I found False pretexts. ‚ÄòIt was difficult to divide Our patrimony, though I longed to end it And call her mine,‚Äô but went not. At the last, My brother, too possest by noble trust For base suspicion, thinking I was loth To leave our ancient home, sent messengers Unknown to us, bidding them welcome her To her brother's home, and she, deluded soul, Came willingly, Love calling, to her doom. But when we knew that she would come, such dread Of what should be possessed us, that we knew, As by some sudden lightning flash revealed, The black abysses round. Bid her not come, We durst not, that were damning proof indeed Of guilt, yet if she came, she brought with her Discovery of our wrong; the woman's wit Swifter than man's slow brain, reads at a glance The secrets of the heart, and there remained Vengeance, disgrace, the severance of the bonds Which now grew more than life‚Äîay, ay, indeed, These things should be but dreadfuller by far Than any we had dreamt of. Yet some gleam Of hopeless hope sustained. As we deceived My brother, so perhaps should Fortune aid, We might deceive her too; and so with dread Vexing us day and night, we did await Our doom and hers. Ah me! the fatal day When at the last she came, I hurried forth To greet her, but the deep o'ermastering sense Of some calamity she could not name Oppressed her, and the lying welcome died Upon my lips as in my eyes she read A love estranged, and shrank from my embrace, Shuddering she knew not why. We strove in vain, I and the partner of my sin, to feign The welcome which we felt not, and I saw, Half pitying, how pale she seemed, grown sick With hope deferred, and how the unbidden tears Sprang to her eyes, as to my noble brother She turned, while he with half paternal words Would comfort her, thinking the deep fatigue Of her long weary journey from the North Had sapped her strength. Poor souls, I pitied them Whose fate drew now so near, though scarce as yet I knew what must be. At the little feast Of welcome that we made, a little while She seemed to shake from her the load of care That first oppressed. We thought our secret yet Lay hidden, and grew hopeful to escape The eyes of jealous love, and so the days Slipped by, and we grew careless, and I feigned To love her still, as still I think she loved. Ah! fools to hope to escape the searching gaze Of love's clear eyes. ‚ÄòFor tho‚Äô we strove to hide Our wrong, one hapless day a furtive glance Surprised, in one brief instant with a flash Discovered all. That night a letter came: ‚ÄòI know your secret, I will go. I pray you Ere 'tis too late repent you of your wrong. Make what excuse you will to your good brother: To-morrow I will go, nor see you more.‚Äô Then in one moment the impassable net Our sin had spread around us stood revealed, And the deep pit of hell which yawned before us, Inevitable. When I strove to feign Excuses to my brother, his great wrath Spurned them, and suddenly he seemed to know The dreadful truth, and love deceived, and faith Abused, worked such a tempest in his soul As broke in frenzy. His false wife he drove Instantly from his side, myself he stung With fierce reproach, but since I was his brother He spared my life. Our poor unhappy dupe, Who yet betrayed us not, with pitying words He comforted, but bade us from his sight, Till he should fix our sentence; but his pride Of noble birth and blameless life unstained Constrained him to keep silence. That same night I stole to where she was. Without a word We knew our doom, and the one only way Of safety, though it led through blood and death, And how the first transgression from the right Leads on by crooked paths, till when the day Is fading, lo! the inevitable pit, Fronting the desperate feet; no turning back, Nor outlet, but through black depths worse than death! Hardly a word we spoke; our purpose showed Too clear for speech. I carried in my belt A dagger, as our Georgian use enjoins, And she, my bane, and yet my love, my joy, Pointed to it, and with her little hand Tried its keen edge, and motioned toward the doors Here, where my brother slept, there, where our guest, With such a dreadful smile as leaves a man A devil. But I dared not do the thing, And whispered, ‚ÄòNot my brother.‚Äô But she signed ‚ÄòBoth; it were useless else.‚Äô And as I shrank With tottering limbs, ‚ÄòQuick; I will come with you.‚Äô And seized the light, and noiseless gained the door Where lay the Prince asleep. One stab, one groan, And all was done. Then silently we went To where our poor dupe lay. One stab again And all was done, and we were free to reap The fruit of crime; free, said I?‚Äînay, but bound With heavier chains than these. But when 'twas done One peril still remained. 'Twas all in vain Should we not hide the deed! She bade me wake An ancient serving-man, who from a boy Had served my house: him, with what lie I know not Of sudden passion and revenged offence, I did persuade, so that he should conceal That which was done, and with me bear the dead To burial, and, since 'twas their fitting end, Should lay them side by side. At dead of night, None seeing us, we laid them in the mould Beneath the trees, and with the morning feigned A story of their flight. In our wild hills Such things are frequent, overwhelming gusts Of furious passion, chilled and quenched in blood, And none would doubt the story. So we dwelt, I and the partner of my guilt, secure In the old house; and all men pitied us, Who by one stroke of pitiless fortune lost She the dear husband of her love, and I My destined bride. Fain had we ended there The tale of black offence, but still remained One damning witness. The poor serving-man Who knew our innocent victims had not fled And where they lay, held o'er our heads a sword Suspended by a hair. How could we rest While this man lived? Sure 'twas a little thing If we who sinned so deeply sinned once more? What was a poor serf's life that we should spare it Who had shed noble blood? And so it came That ere a little month had staled our wrong The poor soul died. So sudden was his end Men talked of poison, but since none could trace What enemy was his, they asked no more. 'Twas but a nine days' wonder, but perchance He knew some perilous secret of the Great. Then seemed we safe indeed, and lived awhile In decent seeming grief within the walls Which now were mine; but (as 'twas noised abroad), The losses we deplored, the empty halls Filled with the haunting Past, the corridors Echoing at night the sounds of ghostly feet, Troubled our peace. No more the ancient home She loved, nor I, but loathed it. Most of all We loathed to pass those dreadful doors which hid A double murder. Therefore, as the heir Of the Prince, if dead he were, or as his steward Till his return, if still he walked the earth, To a rich neighbour I demised his lands And old ancestral towers. Then we sped forth, I and my widowed sister, in feigned grief But secret joy, seeking to hide ourselves From prying eyes, as natural law ordains The afflicted should, and separate awhile, By different roads, our name and rank concealed, At length we came together and were wed By some poor priest, and lived a peaceful life For three brief years, tranquil, sometimes, and calm As from a blameless Past, but ofttimes stirred By sudden storms. Ah! dark unpitying Fate, Which kept our lives asunder, lives that sought Each other, but in vain, till Love was sin, And sin bred crime. Far in the frozen North, In a grey castle 'mid wolf-haunted pines, We made our home. Three little years we spent Together,‚Äî'twas not long, for us who bought Our gain so dear,‚Äînor was it peace indeed We knew, but rather conscience drugged asleep, Starting with sudden fears‚Äîa nightmare dream, From which we woke with staring eyes and lips That syllabled murder‚Äîfor between our souls, Clinging together, rose the ghostly slain, The strong man, the weak woman, the poor serf, All dead and by our hands. And yet I think We were not all unhappy. Time can wither. Not Hope alone but holds an anodyne To blunt the tooth of conscience. Not remorse, But dread and coward fears, o'ershadowing all, Blighted our lives, till long security Brought scarce disturbed content;‚Äî'twas little gain For two souls damned for ever. Till at last, When the sad Past grew dim, a horrible dread Rose with a flaming sword and drave us forth From that poor guilty Eden. For we read ‚ÄòHow the new Lord of our lost home commanded That they should delve hard by, some little dyke, And when 'twas done, behold two skeletons Lay side by side. And tho‚Äô 'twas no strange matter In our wild Caucasus of passionate feuds, Where blood flows fast as water, here was proof Of dreadfuller than wont. For when they raised The poor remains; upon the finger-bone Of the taller shone an emerald signetring, Which all men knew, and 'twas the Prince my brother's, Who never left his home, but lay beneath His old ancestral trees, and by his side A woman's slenderer form. What mind could doubt It was the missing girl, whose flight they mourned For three long years? Nay, nay, she had not fled. No secret tale of shame was buried with them Who lay there thus at rest. The dead girl's honour Showed stainless now, and her great kinsfolk's pride Saved from reproach. They mingling grief with joy,‚Äî Grief she was dead, joy she was pure,‚Äîmade oath To avenge her, and the sleuth-hounds of the law, Already loosed upon her murderers' track, Quested, as yet in vain. Where had they gone, The false wife and her blood-stained paramour? They should be trapped, since still on Russian soil Doubtless they lurked in hiding.‚Äô When I read These damning words, fain had we turned to fly. But whither? since the guarded frontier rose A wall of brass before us. So we stayed, In hopeless hope that haply the great peril Might pass us by, as, trembling in each limb, The hapless quarry, waiting, hears the cry Of the hot chase grow louder, nearer still, And scarcely dares to breathe. And for long months Our silent trackless forests and deep snows Baffled the hunters, till, though pale and worn By long suspense, my guilty love and I Thought once more we were safe. Then one grim day Last autumn, which the southward-flying sun Had gone, and taken life and hope with it, There as we sat within the ruddy glow Of the piled hearth, cheering the solitude, Two guilty loving hearts, while all around The tokens of our ill-got wealth relieved The gloom without, sweet flowers and gems of price, Rich hangings, and the golden light which keeps Perpetual June amid the sunless gloom Of Yule, our summons came. Sudden the door Swung open, and upon the warmth and light Of luxury a dank and deadly chill As from an opened tomb. A rattle of arms, And quick the stern-eyed officers of law Stood round us, and we knew the end was come,‚Äî The end of guilty dalliance,‚Äîthe end Of long anxieties. For it was Death That knocked, and Vengeance, and the Powers of Hell. And then they severed us, without a word, Only one long last kiss, and locked her fast A prisoner in our chamber in the tower. She had no power to speak, nor chance to doff Her gems of price, but like a Queen she went To her doom, for such it was. Great God! how fair She showed, as, flushed with some strange counterfeit Of innocence, and eyes that blazed like fire, With proud contempt she put from her the hands That would have hindered. As she reached the stair She turned and looked on me, and in her gaze I read a mute farewell, while at my belt Her eyes seemed seeking something, and I knew Once more what 'twas they sought. But neither blade Nor arm was there. Then I saw fade and die The fury from her eyes, and in its stead, Writ legibly for love's keen gaze to see, A dreadful purpose, offspring of despair. Then with their pitiless skill, till night was near, In that luxurious room, where late we sat Alone, with none to mark us, deep content Soothing each sense, they plied their torturing art Of question; an inextricable net They wound around us mesh by mesh, while I, Like a poor bird caught in the fowler's toils, Was powerless to escape. Fain had I bade them Forbear and I would tell them all, such horror Of that sad tale, retold in icy words, Possessed me; but remembering who it was Who shared my guilt, hopeless I wandered on, Tightening the noose around our lives, but still Denying all. Then, when some mocking gleam Of hope relieved despair, what shriek assailed My agonised ears? what body flashed and fell Past the tall windows from the height above With a dull crash on the new-fallen snows, Staining them red? Ah me! I knew too well. I saw death in her eyes when up the stair Silent she swept. Then, not with grief, but joy That she was safe from men, her fate fulfilled, And I need lie no longer, ‚ÄòSee,‚Äô I cried, ‚ÄòShe is dead. You shall know all. We two together Did those dark deeds. 'Twas Love that urged us on, Not that of spouse or bride or brother, but Love That burns our lives with fire. Now she has gone Beyond the reach of vengeance on the earth Let me go too. We did it, we together, None else; we stabbed them in their dreamless sleep; They did not cry, nor suffer much, I think; 'Twas a swift blow! And one there was beside Who bare them forth to burial. Listen to me! I poisoned him, because I dared not trust Our dreadful secret with him. That is all. I do not wish to live. Respect, I pray you, That mangled corpse, for she was innocent In the law's eye and noble. Ye who live In bonds of happy love for wife and child, Pity us if you can. I do give thanks To all the Powers that rule and mar our lives, No child of ours shall know its parents' shame. Deal with me as you will.‚Äô But my wrecked life They spared, since I was noble. Ah! the farce Of rank and false nobility which gilds So oft the ignoble brow; but in this place All men are equal, as they are in Hell, And I shall spend my manhood in the depths Of the dark mine, nor put aside the load Of misery till manhood wanes, and age Blunts the desire to live. Say, was it she‚Äî My love, who was a wife tender and true Till the sad day we met; who had no thought For other than her lord, but lived white years Of faithful wedlock‚Äîshe, who bade me slay Her love and mine together? Was it I, The blameless student, whose calm eye disdained The spell of venal beauty‚ÄîI, whose thought Dwelt ever on the heights, and daily walked In converse with the mighty dead of Time, With Plato and with Socrates, and him Who took all knowledge for his own, and him The Saint of the old East, and Him whose Voice The round world hears, but heeds not, and the choir Of Saints and Sages blest; I, whose soft heart Sickened at blood and pain; who did this wrong? Or do men bear twin natures, one of Heaven And one of Hell? Or is it that to-day, Despite the gains of Time, the Word Divine, The counsels of Perfection, with their law Of Mercy to all things, and Purity And Justice, still a vengeful At√© drives Our lives to ruin, and a cruel Fate, Unpitying and resistless as of old, Turns men to devils? Let me meet my fate; I care not what shall come. If I should die, 'Twere well; or should I live, perchance long years May dim the dreadful Past, and leave my age Cleansed by retributive pain. At least I lose The haunting fear, the cold voice threatening doom, Nor yet am wholly damned! Ah! could we meet, My love and I, after long punishment Thro' secular years! For we have suffered much, We have suffered much indeed!‚Äù These things I heard, And, musing as I went, I knew again The old voice heard before, ‚ÄúThere is an end Of Wrong and Death and Hell!‚Äù WHITHER? Tread down, oh Man, beneath thy feet, the brute, Not that the sinless, innocent brute which still Goes on its way unshamed, undoubting, mute, Obedient to the pre-ordain√®d will. But that which deep within your nature lurks Unseen, nay scarce suspected; tooth and claw Red with the stain of age-long time, and works Beneath the dull unpitying primal law. Put off the curse of war, the shame of strife; Make thou the hates, the miseries to cease, But yet forget not that the flower of life May wither in the windless glare of Peace. The Heaven our souls desire is more than rest, Act is our Law, our Joy, our highest meed; By work and that alone our souls are blest, And whose gains it, he is blest indeed. Remember thou of how great dignity Is he ‚Äúwho sees life whole and sees it one,‚Äù Who knows the Past, and what the world shall be; Full grown when its long pupilage is done. Put off the satyr with his carnal leer, Put off alike the tiger and the ape; Keep justice, love, and reasonable fear, Immortal Spirit clothed in mortal shape! Put off alike the worldling and the saint, The aims, too thin, the earthy, grovelling things; The curse of greed, the aspirations faint For heights too cold and far, for flagging wings. Put off the ascetic, shun the sensual sty, Scorn not our dual Nature, nor let Pride Exchange for fruitful earth the barren sky, Since Earth and Heaven are here and side by side. Let Woman be the equal mate of Man, And let the love of all the race inspire With deeper glow than earthly passion can A soul that kindles with diviner fire. Fulfilled with calm beneficent liturgies Keep thy undaunted soul, content to sleep, If such thy Fate, for ever, or to rise When the Voice calling wakes thy slumbers deep; The Voice Divine which sounds from soul to soul, The Voice which still from Youth to Age doth call, Unceasing though the earth forget to roll, And all her wandering sisters swerve and fall. BY TOWY-SIDE. On these fair meads, through half a summer day Beside the blue-eyed river-deeps I lie, There comes no sound to chase my dreams away, Nor veil to hide the clear reflected sky, The low hills smile around on either hand, And up the vale the solemn mountains stand. No change for half a changeful century, Fair river, hast thou known, since I, a boy, Would haste of summer noons to plunge in thee, Snatching unmarked a dear forbidden joy; Nor shall a thousand centuries passing trace One wrinkle on thy smooth unageing face. Sweet wandering Towy, sinuous, silvery, Glide on by town and tower, unchanging glide, Pursue thy path of beauty to the sea, Till thy flow weds the salt inrushing tide, Thus rolled of old thy undiscovered flood, When the new world was born in pain and blood. Within thy depths, ere man had come to birth, Dread mail√®d forms with gory jaws would lurk, The ravening monstrous shapes which swayed the earth, Ere Nature framed her last consummate work; Thou sawest within thy ooze huge Saurians lie, And wide-winged spoilers hurtling thro' the sky. And then for age on age, when Man arose, The gibbering savage mirrored in thy deep; Red wars, oppressions, hatreds, countless woes, Rude hearts that broke, while Mercy seemed asleep, While thou, thro' those dim generations gone Unchanged, unruffled, flow'dst serenely on. And then thro' all our fateful history, Long centuries of war and cruel strife: Our Wales o'erborne, our Britain free and great; Our old race rising with renascent life;‚Äî Still from thy cold hill-fountains didst thou come To seek as we the Deep which is our home. Men come, men pass, but thou flow'st seaward still, Brute Nature, thou immortal art alone! The sea, the stream, the plain, the heavenward hill Built high with ramparts of eternal stone; We who have life and breath, we faint, we die, Ye only view unmoved the unchanging sky. Yon towns and towers shall fall; the land lie bare Or choked with forests dense; and on thy shore The flocks, the herds, the bathers come no more, None there shall be to mark that thou art fair. Only the lone hills shall encompass thee, Thy comrades blind and dumb while Time shall be. Thou shalt glide still, fair stream, uncaring on, Till sea shall be no more, nor earth nor sky, Till all the hapless race of men be gone, And some dread fire shall burn thy fountains dry. Thou in thy changing flow unchanging art, As is the unchanging changeful human heart. Glide on, O silent stream: I would a tongue Were thine, to chant the mysteries of Time! By one weak voice thou shalt not pass unsung, Glide to Life's sea, continual, sublime. Thou shalt not pass away unrhymed so long As men have ears to hear a humble song. PILGRIMS. Slowly against the gradual slope, Following the morning gleam of hope, With feeble forces slow, Our childish footsteps go; From flower to flower we stray, To cheer our upward way, Till the day draws to noon, And our life's year to June. And then while Springtide cheers us still, We press with Youth's impatient feet High thoughts and fancies sweet, Against the cloud-wrapt hill. Higher we mount, and higher, Beneath the tyrannous sun Which, till the day is done, Burns with unsparing fire. Love-whispers flutter in the breeze, Love rests within the grateful shade, Safe hid 'neath secular trees, Our summer home is made. A little, little while The enchanted noon-tides smile, Till o'er the summits far, Behold the evening star. And then our failing feet again Slope down to the forsaken plain, No more the snows, the skies, Dazzle our weary eyes. But dewy twilights deep, And light and warmth of home, Where, ere the nightfall come, Love giveth rest and sleep. Oh, sacred Love, still at my side, My feeble faltering footsteps guide, Oh bless√®d Presence still, Upon Life's rugged hill, Let thy protecting arm Save us from hurt and harm. Guide Thou us, lest we stray Far from Thy perfect way. AN OLD POET. My hand, my pen, lie still, My voice is dumb, No more, unsought, at will Bright visions come; No more on fa√´ry meads, The light forms dance, Nor borne by wing√®d steeds Speeds swift Romance Along the rugged road, With toiling paces slow, Bent by Time's heavy load, The dull feet go. The clear Dawns now shall grow For younger eyes, I mark no more the glow On sunset skies; Fearless across the foam The gay barks fleet, But mine no more may roam, Since rest grows sweet; Toil brings its fitting meed, The haven's rest; Toil has its joys indeed, But this is best. Let younger footsteps soar To snows untrod, I strive, I climb no more, Musing with God. Through the closed gates of home Unheeded, half-forgot, Fainter the memories come Of what is not. The Past shows like a dream, The Present hurries fast; Courage! Life's seaward stream Flows calm at last! IN PRAISE OF NIGHT. No breath of morning wakes The languid dreaming night; Nor through the thick leaves breaks A gleam of light. But on the brooding calm, And ghostly silence deep, Is shed a dreamy balm Of Rest and Sleep. Then sudden, thro' the trees, Listening, unstirred around, Flutters a fairy breeze With whispering sound. And straightway from the throat Of some half-waking bird, One hesitating note, Dawn's earliest word. And then the tranquil night, Faints in the garish ray.‚Äî Loud song, and broader light, Alas! 'tis Day. ON AN OLD STATESMAN. Night falls, nor yet we may discern the Dawn; The sick Age dies, and with it takes the Great, Like perfect music trembling to its close, Or some full river smoothing to its end. Thou art gone from us, O friend, O precious life that so long served the State; Thou art gone from us, and fled, To join the undying dead! Dead! nay, to lie so long breathing reluctant breath, With fainting forces, is not Life but Death; But at the last to 'scape Earth's toil and strife, That is not Death but Life! That is not Death! and thou, thou art not dead, Strong soul, belov√®d head, Tho' hidden in some secret sphere afar, Some faint, undreamt-of star, In God's mysterious infinite air, Hidden we know not how, we ask not where! There is no Death, but only change To some new higher birth and strange; There is no Death, but thou, thou livest still, Brave soul, undaunted will. Thou silvery tongue, thou old man eloquent, Stout patriot, hater of triumphant wrong, Who ever didst despise the ignobly strong; For threescore years to guide our Britain sent. There is no Death, nor will we mourn to-day, Only our prayers we send to speed thee on thy way. But oh! if fair faint memories of the Earth As is our hope, breathe thro' thy newer life, Forget not thou, in that thy higher birth, The dear dead Past, thy noble emulous strife, The victories of Peace, the friendless weak For whom thy swift tongue ever burned to speak. Forget not thou our well-loved land, nor yet The wider Britain of our hope forget, Nor those whom on the sad Armenian plain‚Äî As late on earth thou knewest with bitter pain‚Äî The Moslem fiend dishonours, tortures, slays; Nay, in the pauses of the eternal Psalm Ceasing a little, while from praise Of Him who is ‚Äúmost sure in all His ways,‚Äù Wrapt in a holy calm, Plead thou and intercede For all weak sunken lives that here on earth do pine! Plead thou, that War's black curse may quickly cease In all-pervading Peace, And speed, if any voice once mortal can, The onward March of Man. ON A YOUNG STATESMAN. In Memoriam: Thomas Ellis. Bala, April 11, 1899. Here in this place of Peace we make his grave, Tranquil, alone, Only Llyn Tegid sobs with constant wave, The low winds moan. Here as the silent mountains stand around Salem, the blest, Comes no faint murmur of contentious sound To break his rest. For this was he whom happy, favouring Fate, In manhood's bloom, Called to high service of the grateful State, And then‚Äîthe Tomb. Child of the people, ever proud to keep The ancient tongue, The stern strong Faith, the bardic measures deep, The old hymns sung. The Tiller's lot he knew, borne down, distrest, With none to teach, The God-sent gifts by ignorance represt Fired his swift speech. Blossom and fruit of that new Dawn of gold, That happier Spring, Whither our Wales, with lofty hope grown bold Spreads her glad wing. Ah! deem it not that he was called from toil, To rest too soon, Escaping from life's sad year's blight and soil, While yet 'twas June. Whatever is is best, His will be done, We dare not weep; Not all His work is wrought beneath the Sun Who giveth sleep. Sing, sing in faith your hymns! Give thanks! Rejoice! ‚ÄúAc yn ei fedd.‚Äù Let the dead hear his country's grateful voice, ‚ÄúDuw rho dy hedd.‚Äù LYDSTEP CAVERNS. Here in these fretted caverns whence the sea Ebbs only once in all the circling year, Fresh from the deep I lie, and dreamily Await the refluent current stealing near. Not yet the furtive wavelets lip the shore, Not yet Life's too brief interlude is o'er. A child might play, where late the embattled deep Hurled serried squadrons on the rock-fanged shore, Where now the creaming filmy shallows creep, White-horsed battalions dashed with ceaseless roar, Stirred by no breath, the tiny rock-pools lie Glassing in calm the blue September sky. The shy sea bares her guarded treasures here, Her delicate bosom open to the light, Unclothed I lie, where never foot comes near, Unshamed as 'twere in watches of the night. Fine as a maiden veil of thinnest lawn, From the white strand the creamy vesture drawn. Here in the cool recesses of the cave, Tho' sweet to lie, to dream, 'twere doom to sleep, Lest sudden some impatient crested wave, High-horsed, unbitted from the outer deep, Shut fast the gate of life, and choked the breath, And left me prisoned in the vaults of death. To-day the many-hued anemone, Waving expands within the rock-pools green, And swift transparent creatures of the sea Dart through the feathery sea-fronds, scarcely seen, Here all to-day is peaceful, calm and still, Here where in storm the thundering breakers fill. Here where the charging ocean-squadrons rave, And seethe and shatter on the sounding shore, And smite this high-arched roof, and wave on wave Fall baffled backward, with despairing roar, Or fling against the sheer cliffs overhead, And sow these vaults with wreckage and the dead; Now all is still. Yet ere to-day is done, Where now these fairy runnels thread the sand, Five fathoms deep the swelling tides shall run Round the blind cave, and swallow rock and strand, And this discovered breast on which I lie Shall clothe itself again with mystery. Here through the rayless darkness of to-night, Great fishes, fiery-eyed, with ravening jaw, Hungering will sail, and gorge, and rend, and bite, Obedient to the pitiless primal law, And black eels, slimy, sinuous, haste to tear The hapless swimmer drowned and drifting there. And from their secret hollows in the deep, Mailed things obscene, hooked claw and waving horn Where now I lie, will thronging dart and creep To batten on the violate limbs forlorn, Great devil-fish with strangling arms will cling, And sting-rays flap and slide on impish wing. And then again the ebbing tide will spurn The dank, dead thing which lived and thought to-day, Or haply whirl it when its forces turn To the lone plains of ocean, leagues away, Sunk in its rayless depths for evermore, Or flung dishonoured on some alien shore. So full is Nature of unrest and change, So wasteful of her work, so deaf, so blind, So careful of her brute decretals strange, So careless of the empery of mind. To her the hearts that burn, the souls that soar, Are as her humblest weed and nothing more. Yet like the soul in this, her fullest tide Ebbs furthest, and her inmost deeps lays bare! Turn refluent wave and swiftly deepening hide, These haunted rare-revealed abysses fair. There is a calm more perilous than strife, Better the droughts, the steeps, the glare of life! LUX IN TENEBRIS. Ah! what is life? A flickering fire That on the black vault feebly burns, A force which struggles to aspire, Then sudden, quenched to earth returns. And what is Truth? Our striving eyes Pursue in vain the fleeting light; Beyond the darkling hills it flies And ere we gain them, lo! the Night. And what is Knowledge, but a gleam, A little light, a puny spark, A phantasy, a ghost, a dream, Which only glimmers in the dark? The low sun sinks, the night is here, Life, Truth, and Knowledge fade and die; But from the illimitable sphere, New suns unnumbered light the sky. ON THE THAMES EMBANKMENT. August, 1897. In the hush of the midsummer night The roar of the City grew still, There shivered a breeze thro' the sentinel trees, Like a thin ghost fleeing the light. Then the Dawn came up dreary and chill, And not another sign of life might be But the black river rolling seaward sullenly. But, there by the parapet side, Oh! what is that pitiful throng Stretched supine, drowned deep in the waters of sleep, Dotting the riverside pavement wide, Like sere leaves down the vistas long; That sum of hopeless, homeless misery Fringing the sullen river labouring to the sea? At times from Dome and from Tower, High minster and abbey gray, Falls the solemn swell of the echoing bell With its knell of the world's dark hour, With its hope of the heavenly Day; But not a sound reaches those hapless ears Drugged deep by drink and weariness and tears. With no rest for the weary head, The stern city's outcasts lie, Ruined lives brief and long, the feeble, the strong, With the granite their only bed, Sad comrades in misery; And the mouldering obelisk rears its wedge sublime As erst by the old Nile in the infancy of Time. Ah! beneficent magic of sleep, Fair country of dreams thrice blest, Where old hearts grow young and old love songs are sung, Where the tired eyes forget to weep. Where the stiffened limbs loosen in rest, And folly, failure, wantonness, nay, crime, Seem cleansed in those still depths, and all the stains of time. There they dream till the aching limb Wakes the sleeper to life's dull pain, And the hoarse croak of Death chokes the labouring breath And the dulled senses, happily dim, Seem barbed with new anguish again; And still no happier sight or sound may be Than the black river labouring sullen to the sea. But to one poor wanderer there Comes the trampling of measured feet, And the harsh command, which constrains him to stand In the dark lantern's blinding glare With a heart that forgets to beat; Not thus his long dead mother woke her son When work and bread were his and the brief night was done. ‚ÄúMove on!‚Äù rings the short, sharp word: But where shall the wanderer go, With no share from birth in the niggardly earth, More homeless than beast or than bird? Whither carry his burden of woe? Yet the Law speaks, and he must needs obey, And hopeless fare alone upon his desperate way. Then he sprang with a bitter cry From his lair on the cold, hard stone, Stood a moment upright in the Dawn's drear light, Then bidding his comrades ‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù Leapt into the depths with a groan. A plunge, a sound, and that wrecked life is gone, While the black leaden river rolls unheeding on. Only a wanderer's life, One of myriads who linger behind, Crushed to earth, trampled down by the merciless town, And its cruel struggle and strife. Not the less to a questioning mind These sad tales preach the solemn mystery Of Life, and Fate, and Death, and the dark swallowing Sea. IN PRAISE OF DECEMBER EVENINGS. Slow on the waning landscape creeps the night, On hill and plain the gathering shadows fall, Till, last, soft darkness like a velvet pall, Veils all the fading fields and blinds the sight; Then from the hidden hamlets here and there, From hillside cot, or stately mansion fair, Clear through the frosty, or the milder air, Twinkles home's beacon-light. Dear, swift December evenings, homelier far Than are June's perfumed twilights, warm and still, Her saffron skies, and primrose evening star, Her golden sunsets on the purple hill, Her sports upon the green, her village boys Chasing the bounding ball with merry noise, Her dreaming lovers' visionary joys Which fill young spirits still. Thine is a sober loveliness, denied To those glad twilights of triumphant June, When all the flower-lit fields are glorified, And Love and Youth move to a joyous tune; Too strong, too fast, the impetuous pulses come. Too restless for the calm content of home, Too far afield the impatient fancies roam In Life's young Summer-tide. But thou, in solemn robes of sombre grey, The wayward, wandering fancy dost recall, Thy star-sprent mantle hides the dying day, Gently thy kindly, brooding shadows fall; By June's rich voice Love's melodies are sung, The glad, the blithe unreason of the young; Thine the low tranquil tones, the silvery tongue Which calms and comforts all. Fall, swift December evening, not with snow, Rude blast, or drenching rain, but clear and fine, With breathless calm, or West-wind whispering low, Till Yule-tide brings again its hope divine! Summer is gone, with anxious hopes and fears; Life's tranquil, wintry joys, its precious tears, The lamp that lights, the hearth which warms and cheers, Are all, are only, thine! THE UNION OF HEARTS. An Ode. The Spaniard has fallen! has fallen! Give thanks and rejoice, Great West, with a consonant voice; The Spaniard has fallen, the blight of the ages has fled, And for ever the rule of the priest and the monk lies dead Upon the Philippine and Cuban shore. By the Pacific and the Carib sea The savage Spanish soldier comes no more, The isles once more are free, No more the down-trod peoples cry in vain, In long-unheeded pain; They are free, they are free once more, after rebellious years Of misery and tears. Famine, Oppression, Torture, Murder, long Stalked through the land, and all the hosts of Wrong, But now the black night spent, the reign of Evil done, High in the unwonted skies a miracle appears, And from the West ascends the fair unhoped-for Sun. Thrice happy are the eyes which mark Amid the unbroken dark, A feeble, struggling ray, The first precursor of approaching day; We who live now, midst crash of shot and shell, And wreck, and blood, and fire as fierce as hell, Discern a wonder to renew the Earth, New-mailed to-day a Titan comes to birth. Born late in Time, the Empire of the Free, Lording the West, co-heiress of the Sea, By whose strong arm and stronger thought and word Shall all mankind be stirred; A might which joined with England's shall increase The happier doom of Man, the victories of Peace. Strong were our brave forefathers bold, Who fought the stubborn Don before, On many a perilous sea and tropic shore, In those adventurous days of old; Who chased his towering galleons one by one From sea to storm-tossed sea, from shoal to rock, Till that great tempest blew fierce with resistless shock, And God accomplished what their hands began. Laud we the dauntless sailors, whose rude might Saved Europe and the world from the long curse Of the priest's crooked ways, and worse, The Ignorance he loves as bats the night. Not yet a century has fled since he, Champion of every European sea, Fought in his little ship of English oak With those proud banded fleets, and broke Not Spain alone, but spurned the tyrant's yoke Which menaced all the trembling world; and kept Inviolate our motherland, who bore The mighty empire we acclaim to-day‚Äî Our daughter who shall keep Dominion o'er the deep When we and all our power have passed away. Laud we our watchful sires who never slept, But kept alive, undimmed, by land and sea A beacon fire, the Freeman's sovereignty. Laud them, but never let our thought forget The fresh wounds bleeding yet; The brave knights-errant who by land and sea, 'Mid pestilence and misery, 'Neath blinding suns, and glare, hunger and thirst, Sought only who should face the foeman first, Mown down by shot and shell, yet climbing still Against those grinning casemates on the hill; For hours untended 'neath a tropic sky, Left hopeless in the pitiless glare to die. Young lives for whom till then, Life's primrose way Lay smiling uneventful day by day. Sons worthy of their sires, who willing gave Wealth, health, love, life itself to free the slave, But those for home and country fought, while they For alien suffering flung their lives away. And praise those strong new Paladins of to-day Who keep alive our glorious story still, The dauntless seamen who with patient skill Waiting on daring, drove the hapless prey To wreck and ruin, while the unerring stroke Of giant bolts the steel-mailed cruisers broke, Scatheless themselves, and yet whose pitiful hand Succoured the vanquished. Worthy sons are they Of Drake or Nelson, or that gallant band Those later heroes of their own loved land, Who bore for all to mark, the chivalry And daring of the Sea. Nor shall a generous people yet Their eulogy forget Who fought a hopeless fight and fought it well; The humble lives which in the blazing hold Half-naked, bleeding, dreadful to behold, Braved the dread doom of fire, Who lately from the leaguered harbour went With lace and cross and warlike ornament To death as to a feast. Stout hearts and undismayed! Not to the free alone, but to the slave 'Tis given to be brave. Nor lastly shall our souls forget The mighty silent sister, whose strong fleets Stud each discovered sea, Whose warm heart after age-long discords beats Oh, sister land, in harmony with thee! But for her watchful squadron; who can tell What stress of sordid jealousies befell, What hindering force of harm, The glorious work of thy avenging arm? 'Twas England's might secured thy work to thee! Kinsman to kin allied, freeman to free, Together oh, great sisters, ever keep, Together rule the highway of the Deep, Together sound the knell of tyranny, Swear a great oath that Thought and Man are free! Together raise a beacon from afar, The Light of Equity too strong for War, Together let your tranquil realms increase, Till all the future of mankind is Peace! SIR GALAHAD. Let others sing with earthy lays Of women fair or brown; Not such the Goddess that I praise As worthy of a crown. A snowy neck, a sparkling eye, Red lips and rippling hair, Not these the charms for which I sigh, Not these adorn my fair. Let those who will, with crapulous mirth, Exalt the praise of wine; I hold their joys of little worth, Not such a worship mine. To the enfranchised soul and thought The sordid gains of sense And mean delights are less than nought Compared with innocence. But let me chase from vale to hill My visionary Love; Pursuing ever, baffled still, Yet beckoned from above. From youth to age, from life to death, This dream my soul shall keep, Till with my last expiring breath I wake at length from sleep. A CAROL. Dark are the days, the nights are long, Blithe Summer's joys are done, Yet in our hearts we keep the Sun, And raise a cheerful song. Bare is the world, or deep in snow, Yet are our souls aglow, What spell is this, what still mysterious voice, That calls ‚ÄúRejoice! Rejoice!‚Äù It is, that on the weary earth With every dying year A great hope dawns, a glorious birth, Returns our souls to cheer. Again, again, the Eternal Child, The Virgin-Mother mild, Ring, joy-bells, ring, clear through the frosty air, Ring gladness everywhere. Sound, gracious as that heavenly word Of old in Bethlehem, By night of wondering shepherds heard, When angels spake with them. ‚ÄúPeace, peace on earth to faithful men,‚Äù This be our strain as then, To-day, to-day let all rejoice indeed, Whate'er their form of creed. Peace be and joy! Ay, though it seem To world-worn eyes and ears Across dark gulphs of strife and tears Only a heavenly dream, Divine, divine our souls shall hold Those precious words of old, Goodwill and peace to men‚Äîthe halt, the blind, The poor, nay, all mankind. Therefore we raise our cheerful song, A strain of solemn mirth, Our hope is clear, our faith is strong, In a regenerate Earth. No doubt shall come our eyes to dim, Or check our faithful voice, To Peace on Earth, we raise our Christmas hymn, Whose burden is ‚ÄúRejoice.‚Äù AT THE POPULAR CONCERTS. 1868-98. Silent with listening soul I hear, Strains hushed for many a noisy year, The passionate chords which wake the tear, The sweet old love-songs dear. The dreams of youth surround me still, Thin thronging ghosts the benches fill, The old hopes glow, the old fears chill, Dead aspirations thrill. A little graver, or more gray, Though thirty years have fled away, Scarce changed, the same musicians play The self-same themes to-day. How swift Time fleets, yet here how slow, How scant the visible changes show, New hopes inspire, new empires grow, Yet still the master's bow With magic wakes the slumbering string; Glad tears, the slow bass gains to bring; The silvery, swift sonatas ring, High soaring voices sing. 'Tis I am changed, yet ah! not cold, Oh, precious tones and strains of old, Still round Life's warring discords fold Linked harmonies of gold. SHINE CLEAR, SHINE BRIGHT. Shine clear, shine bright, celestial wells of light, And pierce the mists that bound our earthly sight, Dispel, disperse night's gathered shades away, Till the dawn broadens into perfect day. Sound pure, sound clear, upon the listening ear, High faultless accents of the starry sphere; Silence earth's warring cries of doubt and pain, And wake the primal harmonies again. Calm bless√®d hands unfelt, rebellious sense, With the cool vestal touch of innocence, Beam on us still, invisible gaze serene, And life our minds where long our hearts have been. Thus only shall our purg√®d spirits rise Thro' sight and touch and hearing to the skies, Thus only our enfranchised souls pursue Some ghost, some note, some vesture of the True. IN MEMORIAM. William Ewart Gladstone. Ay, thou hast gained the end Of long and glorious strife, Consoled by love and friend, Thrice bless√®d life! If all the immortal die What gain hath life to give, If all the immortal live Death brings no sigh! Oh, long life lit with praise For Duty nobly done, High aims, laborious days, And the crown won! Why should we mourn and weep That thou dost toil no more? At length God gives thee sleep, Thy labours o'er! The crying of the weak Called not to thee in vain; Thy swift tongue burned to speak Relief to pain. The lightning of thy scorn No wrong might long defy, Thy ruth for lives forlorn, Thy piercing eye. Good Knight! no soil of wrong Thy spotless shield might stain; Thy keen sword served thee long, And not in vain. Oh, high impetuous soul, That, mounting to the Light, Spurned'st the dull world's control To gain the Right. 'Mid strife the Century dies‚Äî Massacre, Famine, War; The noise of groans and sighs Is borne afar. The monstrous cannon roar, The earth, the air, are torn, 'Mid thunderings evermore Time's Dawns are born! But thou no more art here, But watchest far away, Calm in some peaceful sphere, The Eternal Day. Oh, thou who long didst guide Our Britain's loyal will, Invisible at her side Aid thou her still! Oh, aged life and blest, Wearing thy duteous years, Enter thou on thy rest; We shed no tears! Wear thou thy labours to thy country given, Thy eloquent tongue, thy keen untiring brain, Thy changeless love of Man, thy trust in Heaven, Thy crown of Pain. DARK RAYS. Through the abysses unsuspected roll Dark orbs unnoted by the bodily eye Yet visible to the soul, The labouring ages wane and die, Low burns and lower life's expiring sun, Man's history is done. Yet tho' no eye detect the rayless star Shed from those unimagined regions far, Blind influences are. Yea, though it fail to shine, Some dark, invisible light, Some secret force malefic or divine Pierces the encircling night. Not only 'neath high noon's unclouded sky Our onward march is spent, But with us on our dim unlighted way, Mysterious guides are sent; Dark powers unseen, for good or ill, Direct, mislead, oppress man's hesitating will. FOR BRITAIN. A Soldier's Song. December, 1899. Oh, our Britain is a noble realm, as all the nations know, She fought the Don, the Gaul, the Russ, and brought their boastings low; She rules the stormy main, she holds full half the earth in fee, And where her glorious banner flies, there every man is free. Chorus‚ÄîThen cheer for noble Britain all, with one! two! three! Triumphant ever shall she be, o'er land and over sea; The sword and gun were never forged could make our Mother rue, While stalwart arms and loyal hearts are to their Country true. May be the crafty Muscovite would bring her greatness down, May be the Dutchman grudges her her greatness and renown; Our friends across the herring-pond grow spiteful now and then, So ironclad let her navies be, and hearts of oak her men. Chorus‚ÄîThen cheer for noble Britain all, with one! two! three! Triumphant ever shall she be, by land and over sea; The sword and gun were never forged could make our Mother rue, While stalwart arms and loyal hearts are to their Country true. Ay, never fear for Britain, let the plotters work their will, Let them skulk in treacherous ambush, belching fire from rock and hill; Though her generals may blunder, though her bravest sons are slain, Though her best blood flows like water, and the sacrifice seems vain‚Äî Chorus‚ÄîStill cheer for noble Britain, and ere yet your tears are shed, Tend the wounded, feed the children, who have lost for you their bread; Never doubt our final triumph, we will rout them, never fear, When we bolt them from their rat-holes, to the open, fair and clear. Let us set our teeth together, till the bloody task is done, Never doubt our final triumph‚Äîwe will make the Burghers run, Lance, bayonet, and sabre we will make the rebels feel, Krupp himself can forge no truer than our home-made British steel. Chorus‚ÄîThen cheer for noble Britain all, with one! two! three! Triumphant ever shall she be, by land and over sea; The sword and gun were never forged could make our Mother rue, While stalwart arms and loyal hearts are to their Country true. March together! all are comrades, peer and peasant, knit in one, North, South, East, West, by common bonds, till all the peril's done, Scotch, Irish, Welsh, Colonial, with our England's power and pride, One Queen, one Realm, one People, and Columbia at our side. Chorus‚ÄîThen cheer for noble Britain all, with one! two! three! Triumphant ever shall she be, by land and over sea, The sword and gun were never forged could make our Mother rue, While stalwart arms and loyal hearts are to their Country true. FROM DAWN TO EVE. The swift dawn groweth, The frail flower bloweth, Solemn Eve brings her shades, The sweet blossom fades; This is the secret of the ancient Earth, This is the primal mystery of birth. Full noon rides on high, Through the shadow less sky, Black clouds gather round, Fanged with fire, big with sound; This is the tale of Life, portentous, strange, Chequered with pain, the sport of Time and Change. The fountain upspringeth, The strong pinion wingeth, The weak waters sink down, And the tired bird has flown; This is in brief the tale of the breathing of breath, This is the sum of man's story from Birth unto Death. ON A BIRTHDAY. May 24, 1899. Fourscore long years, fourscore! Maiden and wife and mother, pure and white, A blameless life lived in thy people's sight, What would our longing more? Fourscore blest years to-day, Lived on a giddy height, yet not borne down By the great burden of the Imperial crown, In solitary sway. All the long perilous years That thou hast ruled, always thy people's Queen, Loyal to Law and Freedom hast thou been Through joy alike and tears. Throned in thy nation's heart The despot's crooked ways thou could'st not know; To watch the broadening tide of freedom grow, This was thy selfless part. Always thy people's pain Thy tender woman's heart with pity stirred; Thy generous hand, thy gracious royal word, Were never sought in vain. Upon thy widowed throne, Seated apart from all in lonely state, Alone, thou didst confront thy regal fate, Unaided and alone. Nay! for thy royal heart Thy people's love sustained; blest memories still Of too brief happiness thy soul could fill And nerve thee for thy part. Sustained, supported still In that deep solitude which hems the great; A feeble hand to guide the helm of state, But an Imperial will. And ranged around thy throne Children and children's children, puissant, strong, His offspring even as thine, a sceptred throng; Nay, thou wast not alone! Of pageantries of state Patient, the hills, the seas thou holdest dear, A crowned Republican, simple, austere, Contented to be great. Oh, aged thin-drawn life, Whose golden thread binds fast the world in peace, Not yet, not yet, may thy worn forces cease To bar the gates of strife! Thy grandsire flung away A people's loyal love thro' stubborn pride; Re-knit to-day, the kinsmen side by side Acclaim thy gentle sway. No higher glory thine Than this, the best achievement of thy life, That sister peoples spurning hate and strife For peace and love combine! Fourscore such years, fourscore! No greater gift than this high Heaven can send; Front thou unfearing, Mother! Sovereign! Friend! What still it holds in store! A FRAGMENT. [Then rose a shout] Then rose a shout, As of a people long-time mute, which found A sudden voice and with it power. The cry Blending in one loud roar, the unnumbered sum Of petty dissonant lives, laughter and tears, Rage, terror, pleasure, triumph; mingled, blent In one consentient utterance; burst a flood In thunder down the echoing colonnades And dim recesses of the storied shrines, Where dwelt the elder gods; big with high dooms And presages of Fate. Then, ere it fell, The clamour like a bickering thunder rolled Afield beyond the city gates, and woke The silent river loitering to the sea, Till the shy sea-mews wailed. Last on the hills Untrodden, dim, which hung 'tween plain and sky, Mounting it smote, and on her eyrie roused The watchful, nesting eagle, till she raised Her half-closed eyelids; the light-footed fox Pricked a keen ear; all birds and beasts of prey, Seeking their meat in silence in the night, Paused from the quest a moment at the shock Of that strange formless roar. Anon it died, Swallowed in silence; and the loneliness Of that still listening world grew terrible, As is the ghostly rush of worlds which wheel For ever through the ages dumb and dead; Yet no voice came. But what had been, had been. ARMED PEACE. January, 1899. The hopes of Humanity fly, the doubts and the terrors remain, Knowledge droops and the Churches sigh, and the world is girdled with pain, The shadow of War broods deep, alike over mainland and sea, And men's eyes stare vacant of sleep for thought of the evils to be. Man sickens as under a curse, and only his burdens increase, Scarce are War's dread calamities worse, than the blight of an Arm√®d Peace, Deflowered is his innocent youth, brought low is the Pride of the Race, With its wings that would soar to the Truth, fallen earthward in deep disgrace. The young men sober and chaste, strong sires of the ages to come, On the stews or the tavern waste the temperate virtues of home; The maidens their destined wives, in pure wedlock and motherhood sweet, Pine unwedded through lonely lives or dishonour the pitiless street. Allured and engrossed by the cost of the engines of slaughter and pain, Half the fruits of Science are lost, spent on deadly devices in vain; Overburdened, fettered and bound, faint, despairing, ill-housed and ill-fed, The workers lie crushed to the ground in a bitter striving for bread; In kennels obscene they are pent, where hardly a hound should dwell, While the wealth that might free them is spent on a nightmare of imminent hell. Scarce a pittance is left men to spare for the needs of the pitiful throng, Who assail them with impotent prayer in vain, tho' the suffrage be strong; Nor succour to give to the old, the feeble, the outcasts forlorn, Who in nakedness, hunger, and cold curse God that they ever were born; Nor clear voice of learning to rouse the slumbering spirit and brain, Nor Homes of Compassion to house the sad sum of incurable pain. For Moloch cries loud for his dead with a thunderous roar, and his shrine Craves the flesh of the peoples for bread, and the blood of their slaughter for wine. THE FORTUNES OF BRITAIN. April, 1898. My Britain, they cavil and sneer, And bid thee take heed to thy ways, Forgetting, oh Motherland dear, Thy secular praise! How wherever thy proud banner flew Freedom followed, with order and right, And thy sails lit the limitless blue Like pillars of Light! Nay, my England, thou wilt not forget, Thou the mother and home of the free, The bounds by thy Destiny set 'Twixt the nations and thee. Not thine, the mad folly to boast, With the braggart delighting in war, But to guard thy inviolate coast, And thy children afar. No need for their warning is thine Lest thou fall from vainglory and pride; Oh, mother of men, half-divine, Bearing sway far and wide! Though the frost of the Muscovite chain The nomads Rome never might tame; Though childless France crackle in vain Like a thorn-brake aflame, With no worthier message to guide The peoples who bow to her rod, Than crowned Wantonness, Faith thrust aside, And denial of God; The stiff German's mechanical drill Dash to ruin the hopes of the South, Till men hear with a wondering chill The harsh words of his mouth; Till Armenia, till Hellas again Are swept by the Mussulman flood, And the loathly Turk triumphs in vain; Through torture and blood. None of these know to build up the State Reared to Heaven on the rock of the Free, Nor dare the Imperial Fate Which is given to thee; No offspring of their's over sea Shall replenish the wastes of the earth, No empire in days that shall be Of their loins, come to birth; They shall pass, while the world marching on Takes no heed for their fugitive name, But though their brief puissance is gone, Shall remember thy fame. Thine, oh mother, it is, thine alone, The hearts of thy lieges to move, To raise up the myriads who groan To Freedom through love! From the North to the South thou shalt sway, Thou shalt sway from the East to the West, From the Dawn to the setting of Day, Thy rule be confest. So long as thou workest for Man Through Freedom and Justice and Peace, Let thy enemies strive as they can, Still thou shalt increase. Yet not long shall thy Empire endure, If thy wandering footsteps have trod Crooked pathways, o'ershadowed, obscure, Far from Light and from God: Thy strong fleets and armies shall fail, Thou shalt fade from the knowledge of men; But march onward, be bold and prevail, God helping, till then. Not on armies or fleets let thy might Be built, oh dear Motherland sweet, But always toward Mercy and Right Set thy labouring feet. Who in these things rejoiceth; her pride Is the pride of the Faithful and Just, And her name shall be glorified When all else is dust. IN ANOTHER ALBUM. Flit softly, Muse, nor dread too much thy fate, O'er this fair cloistered pleasaunce of the great; Ah me! through many a close-locked shrine of yore, Thy young wings flew where now they come no more. Here amid gathered stores of every art, Essay once more to do thy courtly part. See, of thy kinsfolk, on the storied wall, The taper neck on which the axe should fall; Hard by, her daughter too, the maiden Queen, Who broke the tyrannous Spaniard's pride, is seen. Here with the painter's art, rich ceilings glow, And nymph and goddess light the scene below; Unfading tapestries enrich the stair, And the dead grandame still is young and fair; The old East brings the Persian's subtle grace, The lattice which reveals, not hides the face, The potter's fictile hand, the goldsmith's skill, In costly ranks the ordered chambers fill; All precious things, which make existence sweet, And dull the tramp of Time's advancing feet. Flow gently, ink, nor with rude blot deface The page a Queenly hand has deigned to grace. Crown, Muse, thy head with flowers discreetly gay, For Springtide summons, and the hour is May. APOLOGIA. Be failure mine, not fame; Let not the ignorant, applauding crowd With coarse Hosannas loud, Worse than the carping critic's venal blame, Flout my dishonoured name. I alone know the goal I strove to win, How strait the gate, how few may enter in, How high the white peaks loom upon the skies, Too far, too fair, too faint for mortal eyes. Brief is our road, evil and few our days, Spare them the insult of unworthy praise! Let the conspiring throng Laud the obscure, the inarticulate line, Which, wilfully defrauding sense and song, Drags its dull length along, Or those whose doggerel Muse delights to teach Treasures of gutter-speech. Such praise be never mine! Too great, too deep the reverence I owe To those whose pious hands were first to sow The little seed by Fate decreed to grow, To the sweet roses of our English tongue, The immortal, honeyed measures sung, The lucid radiance fine; Not the clipt speech, the dark mock-mysteries Shall ever charm like these, Such praise be never mine! But let me still regard with straining sight The perilous steep, the yet unconquered height, Let me a little higher than the plain, Admire, aspire, faint, and recede again, Advancing, failing, still Not far above the sights and sounds of life, The humble hearts of men, the toil, the strife, Let me unmarked admire The cloud-wrapt heights, the dark glooms dealing fire, For should I gain even for a moment's space To see the young Apollo face to face, Pressing my feet against the sacred hill, What gain were it to feel Life hid no worthy secret to reveal, No thick-veiled heights beyond; And I, knowing how weak my voice and brain, Should feel not joy, but an immense despond, And for the chequered victories that were, Only a blank despair? Therefore I seek not praise, But with my lot am well content, If only, when my days are done, Somewhere beneath the aspect of the sun, Haply some grateful, humbler soul shall say: ‚ÄúNot on himself he spent What modest gift was his, nor on wise brains and strong, But to the toiling, unregarded crowd Of souls, by Time and Labour bent and bowed, For solace of their daily burden, vowed His litany of Song.‚Äù SHERBORNE. AN ODE, Sung on its 350th Anniversary, April 20, 1900. I 'Tis fifty years since last we met to keep our festal day, And many are gone, and some are here, tho' wrinkled now and grey; The long dim past grows clearer as we meet, and not in vain Recall the fleeting days of youth and turn to boys again! Our years increase, our blood runs slow, we hasten to grow old, But never shall our souls forget, till heart and hand are cold; The old school, the dear school, where we were boys together; The old days, the dear days of life's young April weather; When the future filled with gleams of gold the musing boyish eye, And all the world seemed at our feet, and hopeful hearts beat high! II Many have since by East and West found glory or a tomb, Some toiled for God and country 'mid the city's stifling gloom, Some midst wrangling of the Forum, or dull chaffering of the Mart, Have slaved for children and for home, contented with their part; Their years increased, their limbs moved slow, they hastened to grow old, But never did their souls forget, till heart and hand were cold; The old school, the dear school, where we were boys together; The old days, the dear days of life's young April weather; When the future filled with gleams of gold the musing boyish eye, And all the world seemed at our feet, and hopeful hearts beat high! III Grey are our heads, but still there come bright lads with sunny hair, The gay throngs wake the cloistered courts where once their grandsires were, Youth, like a red rose, lights the shade with gleams of rising day; Dear Lord! guide Thou their footsteps while they tread life's perilous way; Increase their years, make strong their limbs, prepare them to grow old, But never let their souls forget, till heart and hand are cold; The old school, the dear school, where we were boys together; The old days, the dear days of life's young April weather; When the future filled with gleams of gold the musing boyish eye, And all the world seemed at our feet, and hopeful hearts beat high! IV We are strangers when we visit now the scenes we loved before, The playfields and the river where we raced and plunged of yore; Youth blossoms, and shall blossom still when centuries have gone, And young lives, to-day undreamt of, shall press tireless, fearless, on; Their years shall grow, their limbs move slow, and they in turn grow old, But never may their souls forget, till heart and hand are cold; The old school, the dear school, where they were boys together; The old days, the dear days of life's young April weather; When the future filled with gleams of gold the musing boyish eye, And all the world seemed at their feet, and hopeful hearts beat high! V Let us band ourselves together, sons of Sherborne, young and old, Let us swear it by the Minster, while the curfew bell is tolled; Come good or evil fortune, bright successes, dreary days, For the old school which nourished us we thrill with love and praise. Our years increase, our blood runs slow, we hasten to grow old, But never shall our souls forget, till heart and hand are cold; The old school, the dear school, where we were boys together; The old days, the dear days of life's young April weather; When the future filled with gleams of gold the musing boyish eye, And all the world seemed at our feet, and hopeful hearts beat high! RHYME, THE CONSOLER. The injuries of Time, The treacherous years, Fate's pitiless march sublime, Life's hopes and fears, Defeats, calamities; Their lives scant power in Man, to master such as these. There is no comfort left In rite or spell, For lives of love bereft, Or loved too well, Long, self-inflicted grief, Alas! Time brings for such nor solace nor relief. The princely gains of Thought, Knowledge the Queen, No remedy have brought For what has been, Nor healing balm impart; The philosophic brain soothes not the stricken heart. But who with steadfast mind And musing eye, To either fate resigned, Questions not why, For him, not all in vain Rhyme brings with honeyed tones an anodyne to pain. FOR THE NEW CENTURY. I. Nineteen long centuries to-day Our great Hope came to birth, And He Whom faithful souls obey Made glad the waiting Earth. Peace was the message that He brought, The all-compelling word; Yet spite of all the Master taught, Not yet man sheathes the sword. Aye, nineteen centuries have fled, Each to its place of doom; Their hopes, their fears, their glories dead, Deep buried in the tomb. The old bad passions vex us still, Greed, hate, the curse of war; Dark fears the trembling nations fill, And he, our Hope, seems far. Upon the veldt the maimed, the slain, The sick uncared for lie; The martyr's cry assails again The pitiless Eastern sky. ‚ÄúIn vain‚Äù the doubter sneers, ‚Äúin vain‚Äù The suppliants' groans, the tears, There seems no power to heal their pain, There seems no ear that hears. What! Are our hopes then dead and done? Own we no Lord Divine? Nay, shine Thou forth, long-clouded sun, O blessed Dayspring, shine! Still though the heavenly voice seem dumb, Thro' men's souls hidden deep, Unchanged, its living echoes come, Not silenced, nor asleep. Dawn, O new Age, more calm, more pure, Than those dim troubled years; Bring wider knowledge, faith more sure, Love, peace, an end of tears. A new Day flushes from the East, Haste, haste, celestial birth! Reveal Thou, O Eternal Priest, New Heavens and new Earth! Christmas, 1900. II. The New Age comes, I hear its hidden wings Beat with the Dawn above the weary Earth, New hopes, new fears, new wider aims it brings, This late born Titan newly come to birth. Dead is the age in which erewhile we were, Dead are its glories, and its failures dead, In storms and clouds it sinks and murky air, And lo! a New Sun Journeys overhead. Bring Thou a happier Future for Mankind, New Age, and make the Ape and Tiger die, Till we, who turn to earth with vision blind, Seek with enfranchised eyes the illumined sky. Enrich our lives with every precious fruit Of knowledge, bind alike the Deep and Sky, Wing Thou the sluggish body of the brute Till with new-conquered powers it soars on high. Draw by invisible bands, together draw The furthest corners of the globe, and bind The blessed chain of Universal Law Which links the Race together, heart and mind. Bring Peace not War, Knowledge not Force, till each Finds his best profit in the gain of all, This precious lesson be it Thine to teach That none may tarry, if his brother call. Free all from covetous aims and selfish greed And low sectarian hates and jealous strife, And give us for the unquiet hearts that bleed The deep contentment of a flawless life. Nor let Thy mind forget, O dawning Age, In outward gains the inward gift sublime, The love of good, the glow, the godlike rage Which shines in Woman through the mists of Time. For Man through all the painful Past in vain Has stumbled, halting on his hopeless way, With half his strength unused, with half his brain, And more than half his heart lost till to-day. Bring Thou the full enfranchisement which can Make of the Woman a new precious Force, The Partner, not the Parasite, of Man, A strong stream welling from a purer source. Then shall the World's long agony give place To gentler aims which seek the better part, Peace, Mercy, Purity, abounding Grace, Born of the wedded powers of Mind and Heart. A purer Life, a higher Destiny, A nobler Art, a deeper love of Right; Rise, Woman, fit thyself for what shall be, Ascend, soar upward in the new-born Light. January I, 1901. January I, 1901. AN ODE. Sound trumpets! sound a peal for the New Year! The great New Year which brings another Age; The old, the weary Century at last Closes its time-worn page; Its hopes, its fears, its aspirations dead, Deep buried in the irrevocable Past. Close, close its eyes, cover its aged head. It was an earnest Age; from early youth It sought the face of Truth, Not as its world-worn sire, it lived and died Absorbed in scoffing doubt and scarcely human pride; Never it scorned the toiling multitude, But loved the general good, And dowered the Race with many a gain sublime, Grander than any of recorded Time. Chant low its dirge awhile! then with loud voice Acclaim the coming Sovereign and rejoice! Relight hope's waning fires! be of good cheer! Put vain regrets aside and chilling fear, Sound trumpets! sound a peal for this the great New Year! The centuries rise and pass, They wane and cease to be, Man's soul reflects as in a glass Their fateful history. From Egypt, Greece, and Rome The long processions come, From progress to decay The pageants slowly pass, on their appointed way. There seems no lasting gain, since all Spring up awhile alike, and flower and fruit and fall, But though the peoples fade yet Man remains. Each with its added sum Of treasure for the Race; Still, still the long processions come, Each brings its special gift of Wisdom, Strength, or Grace, High pleasures, nobler pains. Oh youngling Age! oh Child divine! In whose clear eyes strange skies reflected shine, Undimmed as yet by the dull mists of years, Life's sad inevitable soil and stain The doubts, the carking fears, The joys that end in pain! How shall a purblind gaze foretell The secret of thy long course guarded well? We who have lived with children at our knees Know with what deep anxieties We do forecast their future, and would fain Keep it from blot and stain, But yet, but yet too oft our care is vain! And thine we cannot guess, nor if thy life Shall sink in some tremendous strife, The Armageddon of war-haunted days; The dead Age which passed yesternight to rest Was greater and more blest Than all its sires, and earned a higher praise, Yet from its youth even to its dying bed Came sights and sounds of pain, War vexed its hours, the martyrs' blood was shed, And Moloch roared with thunder for his slain! Oh new Age, may a happier lot be thine! Through the swift cycles which shall bound thy life Peace be thy lot, not strife Pursue thy course divine. Thine may it be to trace by paths untrod Nature's dark secrets, only known to God, Assert dominion over earth and air! Bind thou the nations everywhere! Till Space be lost and Time And all the bars of Race and Speech and Creed Sink and are merged indeed In one pervading Unity sublime. Nor aught survive of War's ill-omened brood, Plague, Famine, Hatred, Blood. Raise thou the peoples from their vile estate, The light of Knowledge spread for small and great! Free Woman's generous heart and subtle brain! It shall not be in vain! And then it shall be thine To speak the gracious pitying word Divine Of succour for the weak and trodden down; From failing age to lift its crushing load And speed it on its road; Beside the sufferer's bed to stand With wiser, healing hand; And with a new-born civic sense Rebuild the hovels where the poor to-day, Hopeless, ill housed, and losing innocence, Pine, body and soul, away. Let a great band of workers come to be Vowed each with each to wiser charity; Raise thou the flower of Knowledge fair and sweet, Not only forced amid Wealth's hothouse air, But by the homely cot or crowded street, Blossoming everywhere; And wing the soul of Man, The struggling soul, sightless so long and mute, Scarce higher than the brute, To what pure heights the enfranchised spirit can. Reap thou, oh happy Age, Thy glorious heritage. Garner ripe sheaves of Science fully grown, Which the wise Past hath sown; The weird Power which the dead age dimly saw Shall, subjected to Law, Enrich thy life and bring unfailing Day, And thro' the trackless air Spread venturous pinions swift, for those who dare. And do thou reinforce Man's feeble sight Till the faint fires of night Seem sister-worlds, whose hills and plains we know. Tame thou at last the vast Titanic force Born of our planet rushing on her course. Wake thou the new powers unsuspected still, Which sleeping wait thy will. But more than all, oh happy Age, increase Man's knowledge of God's will, and give him Peace, Till he attain at last, Spurning his baser Past, To loftier spheres and far horizons vast. Shall these things be? Alas! we cannot tell; Whate'er Fate sends us, to have Faith is well. Sound trumpets! sound a peal for this the glad New Year! January 1, 1901. IN MEMORY OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN. I. January 22, 1901. The days, the years, the centuries decay, Decease, and pass away; And we, whose brief lives fleeting seem No longer than a dream, Fade and decease as they. Virtue, nor piety, nor regal State, Nor all a nation's prayers can delay The pitiless march of Fate. We have our destined term, both small and great; We fade, and pass away. Belov√©d thin-drawn life, who now at last, Life's chequered fortunes past, Ceasing from care and labours nobly borne, Hast entered willing on thy well-earned rest; Who, longest of all Monarchs of our race, Unmatched in dignity and grace, Thy pure, untarnished Diadem hast worn; Not pitiable thou, but blest, Such weight of anxious cares thou layest down With thy sad earthly crown; A woman vowed to duty, lonely, tried, Unhelped, with no protecting arm to guide, Thro' many a civil broil, and storm of war Thou showest a single star Shining serene above the gathering strife, The clouds, the troubles of thy people's life; For thee to-day thy countless millions yearn With hearts and lips that burn. From North to South, from East to West, Where'er thy gracious Empire is confest, O'er every subject land, o'er all the Earth; Thy Austral-Britain newly come to birth; Thy great Dominion of the snow-clad North; Thy tropic isles; thy Orient's storied plain, From the Himalayan peaks to the blue surge-fringed main; O'er that new realm, scarce won by British blood, Swept still by hopeless war's retreating flood; All know and mourn thee, and revere Their Queen and hold thee dear Who know in her, as we, A righteous life unstained, a blessed memory! But nearer than their homage, and more dear To every loyal ear Than titular splendours or Imperial State, Sounds thy new name, which loving hearts create, ‚ÄúThe Mother!‚Äù this the universal word By which all hearts, all hues, all creeds are stirred. ‚ÄúThe Mother!‚Äù Not from suffering lives alone Flinging their sorrows down before thy throne In this sad, toil-worn Britain, but where'er, In either hemisphere, By palm or pine, tropic or Arctic sky, Our English Standards fly, Or that great West, thy grandsire's stubborn pride Lost, by thee re-allied; This welds the race in one, this name can bind The peoples, heart and mind, This symbol of Imperial Unity Which links, yet leaves men free. To-day the golden cord is loosed at last Which long time bound men fast. The star is set, which in the East, long time, Men gazing, held sublime! Ah! be it thine! pure heart and steadfast will! To guide our Britain still. The Times are restless, the unquiet Earth Moves to some new mysterious birth; The curse of war still vexes, and our race Seems sinking to disgrace. For peace the widow and the orphan cry, With torture-pains Christ's innocent martyrs die. Thou who hast known so many a piercing pain, Love, children, children's children, wept in vain, Friend following friend, and thou still left alone Upon thy lonely throne; Who mournedst last, thy people's lifeblood shed, Their high, their lowly, manhood, maimed and dead. Think of us still, if God so wills, and plead! As daily thou wert wont indeed, For this thy people which must toil and bleed. Plead thou for Peace for all the suffering Earth Till comes at last Man's new Millennial Birth; Plead, tender, aged voice, till all is well! Friend! Sovereign! Mother! Oh, Farewell! Farewell! II. February 1st and 2nd, 1901. 1st. Forth from her Palace gate Down to the wintry shore Bear her with Royal state, Who comes no more. Within her swift ship's side Lay her down solemnly; Thus when the Vikings died They sought the sea. Glide phantom-like, glide slow, Down the long line and far Where range in dreadful row Her fleets of war. Silent and slow glide past, Oh funeral ship, and thread Her steel-mailed Titans vast; Bearing the dead. For this was she their Queen Who three-score perilous years Fronted whate'er has been; Hopes, sorrows, fears‚Äî Whom‚Äî'tis but four brief years‚Äî They praised with thunders loud; Hushed now the shouts, the cheers, The applauding crowd. Guard her, strong ironclads, well Safe to her further shore, For hark the tolling bell! She comes no more! 2nd. Speed her with all her train Of Kingly potentates To where once more again Her London waits. And let the unnumbered throng In this sad pageant see, As slow it sweeps along, Her Jubilee. A Jubilee of life Lived well, and therefore blest; Care, then, at times and strife, Peace now and rest. Let her loved soldiers brave, As when a soldier dies, Make for their leader's grave Due obsequies. Fiags, fifes, the drum's low beat, The dead, where lay the gun; No more shall come her feet, Her long march done. Lay her beneath the shade Of Windsor's regal towers, Where in sad widowed hours Her tomb she made. Lay her beside her dear! Long-severed lovers twain! At last, nor only here, Knit close again! AN ODE OF WELCOME TO THE TRADES' UNION CONGRESS, SWANSEA, 1901. Welcome to these our busy toilworn vales, Strong Parliament of Labour! For we know How great thy powers have grown and still shall grow Lightening the worker's lot; Before thy fearless blade of keen debate The banded armies of the careless Great, Wealth, Privilege, the dull unheeding State, Shrink baffled and are not. Guide these our toiling myriads well, and take Their aimless strength and wake Where once the cold Economist bore sway The genial warmth of a humaner day; Speak for the voiceless multitudes, and bind The labourers, heart and mind, Till each knit fast with each, Obeys the common good thy tongue can teach. Dumb was the worker, but to-day grows strong, No more he suffers wrong; Welcome, great Congress, to our toiling Wales! For here mid murky air or sunless mine, The grimy workers‚Äîcurst By the old seeming-stern decree Divine, Which the Beneficent Will Converts to blessing still‚Äî Labour, adust, athirst. All night the strained arms from the furnace take The blinding, scorching, steel; All night while others dream, tired, half-awake, The miners crouch and kneel; Or ere the dreary dawn, start from their heavy sleep. Toil, toil is theirs, sickness and scanty food To rear their growing brood; Small solace save the faith that looks above The hymns, the songs, they love; And oft despondence takes them dark and deep, It seems that no man heeds them, or their pain‚Äî Let them not cry in vain! And sometimes through the haunted, lonely mine Sudden there rolls a dreadful noise, And the strong father, working with his boys, Knows that his life and theirs are done; They shall not greet again the rising sun‚Äî The low roof thunder down and is their tomb, They pine, they die in rayless gloom; Or withering flame flashes like lightning by, Blinding the hapless eye‚Äî Then the dread after-damp, which chokes the breath And in a moment, death! Last, one by one, the shrouded corpses come, Borne to the darkened home,‚Äî This seems the end of all, this, lifelong labour's sum! Consider well, oh Toiler's Parliament, These poor lives worn and spent! Lift thou, the heavy burden of their care, Gain for them healthier dwellings, wholesome air: The wage that is their due do thou secure, Make thou their weakness strong, Guide them to live lives, sober, provident, pure; For ruinous Strife, teach them the ways of Peace, Their knowledge and their restful hours increase; One people are we, small and great, Dispel the clouds of ignorance and hate! A little time, a little 'tis we live, And I who have no aid but this to give, Welcome you gladly with a heartfelt song! ODE ON THE NINTH JUBILEE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW. This is a joyous day For these loved haunts, where now for centuries long Knowledge, a maiden half-divine, Has reared her favoured shrine. This is a fitting theme indeed for song: Thou dwellest here, thou shalt not pass away, Blest Influence sublime: This is a joyous day, and a thrice-happy time. The hurrying ages fleet On rapid noiseless feet The youthful generations speed away. Here, for their little day They come; yet may not tarry long, but seem Like some dim fitful dream. They come, they carry away their little treasured gain, They pass into the rush, the stress, the strife, The troubled stream of life; Each year they stay while leas are bare and cold, But when ripe autumn clothes the fields with gold, By the old homestead dear, with restful brain, The peasant-scholar reaps the hard-earned grain. Sometimes 'twould seem, as if indeed They won with all their toil a scanty mead, No due reward for vigils innocent, Chill lamp-lit dawns, dim eyes and forces spent, Deep thirst unquenched, vague aspirations high, For peaks too faint and far for mortal eye, The scanty meals, the solitary years, The failures and the tears. What has their cold and cloistered Queen to give These youthful votaries, in haste to live, Thro' whose full veins the hot blood courses fast, While Pleasure with her gay train dances past? What spell is this which keeps these young lives white, Scorning all low delight, And leads their struggling footsteps still O'er rock and moor and fell, and perilous sands, Where the bright city glimmers on the Hill, And at the gate, smiling with outstretched hands, A gracious Presence stands? Oh sore-tried Youth, agile of limb and brain, For whom Life's mystic page scarce-opened lies, Dazzling thy eager eyes, Here hast thou toiled and shalt, and not in vain. Ages have passed since first to this loved place, The future in his face, With heart and soul aflame, And thirsting for the emulous strife, From many a lowly cot the ardent peasant came, And oft prevailed and gained the goal of Life: Jurists, Proconsuls, Statesmen dear to fame, Divines, Discoverers, a noble band Honouring their mother-land; Who faring dauntless forth o'er every sea Have reared the puissant Empire of the Free! Oh reverend mother of a strenuous race, We do acclaim thee, and confess thee great, Who like thy sisters scorning Time and Fate, Nine times to-day hast kept thy year of Jubilee! To-day well nigh five studious ages crown Thy story with renown, Not 'mid the cloistered courts and lilied meads Of our dear Isis, lit with spire and dome, Or her grave sister of the fenland plain, Is set thy hallowed home, But 'mid the clangour of the enormous town, Life's stress and toil and pain; Where on the crowded river-reaches float, Bearing their priceless freight to shores remote, The deep-sunk argosies her sons have made. Not thine the brooding calm, the Academic shade, Where comes no murmur from the world without, Rude struggle, clamorous shout, To mar thy musing day-dreams. Nay, thou art Of the loud world a part; Triumphs of loom and forge from all the nations round Adorn to-day thy garden ground, Art's glittering pageants compass thee about. Thou hast no time to dream, And yet old Hellas deigns with thee to dwell, Naiad and Dryad love thy precincts well; The a√´ry Nymphs of Number and of Line Are still as ever thine; The searcher tracks dread Nature's secret powers, Thro' the hushed midnight hours; Nor ever on thy patient selfless toil The blight of Mammon comes to vex or soil The people's Academe. Therefore it is I bring, I whose sole gift it is to sing, This willing tribute of a hasty lay, For I in our dear Wales have loved to mark Sound learning's new-lit spark Dispel at last the weary age-long night; Have known thy altar fires from which it came And fed long time the flickering nascent flame, Till now it shines a broad effulgent light, From sister-beacons three, By mast-thronged port, lone hills, and sounding sea, And interchanging each with each Thy sons and theirs alternate learn and teach, Hastening the dawn of Man's increasing Day; Nor least of all because One, near in blood and name, Preferring Science and her fruitful laws To the Bard's hazardous fame, Spends here laborious days; content to see Upon the toil-stained Clyde Part offspring of his hand and brain, Mighty to rule at need the subject-main, The steel-clad cruisers ride; For these, and that I prize the precious thirst For knowledge which we gained from Scotland first, Willing I keep, with you, this solemn Jubilee! THANKSGIVING. St. Paul's, June 8, 1902. It was Peace, blessed Peace once again That those jubilant voices would hymn, For the ceasing of sorrow and pain The eyes of the people grew dim. The deep organ pealed, by the sound Of the keen martial trumpets increased, The thousands were kneeling around, King and noble, citizen, priest; When, suddenly lifting my eyes To the glooms half discovered above, I marked with a start of surprise The white wings of a hovering dove. It is Peace, It is Peace once again! Blest messenger, come to your home! And Thou Spirit Ineffable come, As at Pentecost come and remain! UNIVERSITY OF WALES. Ode on the Installation of the Chancellor, May 9, 1902. Six years ago, six little years, no more, By Ystwyth's sounding shore, 'Mid plaudits of the lettered throng And gay processions long, Our Prince assumed the Academic gown Since then what chequered fortunes strange, What shocks of fateful change, Our motherland has known! Uncrowned to-day that gray, belov√®d head, Laid with the honoured dead, And he whose praise we then rejoiced to sing, Of all the Britains King! Another wears to-day the storied name Linked with our Cambria's fame. And oh, since then how fierce a blast of war Smote Britain from afar: What torrents since of young, of innocent blood Rolled down, a dreadful flood. On the lone veldt beneath the alien sky Peasant and noble undistinguished lie, Slain, or by deadlier sickness doomed to die; Year by sad year defeats, disasters grew; Scarce yet the bloody sacrifice is done, The mournful victory won. What hecatombs of suffering, sorrow, pain, Has Britain vowed again! Once more has Cambria rejoiced to bear Her full, allotted, glorious share Of that great load of peril and renown She bore from Crecy down. Since then our Prince has seen o'er half the world Our Britain's flag unfurled, And bound our scattered realm, by land and sea, In close-knit sympathy; The link of common sacrifice and pain Binds with a stronger chain Even than the tardy triumph which shall come‚Äî Be this, at least, our solace and our gain! Turn, exiled Britons, to your ancient home, Turn from far seas and scarce-discovered lands, Warm hearts and strong right hands, To us, your ancient countrymen, who know To-day the same strong passionate pulses glow For Britain and the Empire of the Free, As when long time our valiant sires withstood The Norman on these hills, and sank at last in blood. Hushed be to-day the noise of arms, and far From this white festival the blight of war. From far-off seas lost Madoc comes to wear The peaceful Academic vestments fair, By patriot souls long since foreknown and won, Which late his sire assumed, and shall his son. What changes, Cambria, hast thou known since last, In thy rude vanished past, Another Edward here, by politic art, Tricked thy unconquered heart! What ages of oppression then and scorn, Till with the Tudors' native rule reborn, Ceasing at length to mourn Llywelyn dead, Thou didst uplift thy head, Only to sink again thy dormant life In dull peace worse than strife; Untaught, obscure, drowned deep in lethargy, While thy strong sisters sped o'er land and sea; Keeping of all thy valorous forces strong Nought, save thy ancient speech and resonant song, Save where the Peasant-Preacher of the Word Thy slumb'ring pulses stirred. But now, but now, give thanks! at length! at last! Spurning the inglorious past, Thy numbed limbs move, thou wakest, Motherland! Here by thy salt sea-river's palaced strand, Here where hard by thy soaring summits stand, Dull slumbers chain no more. On the loud margin of the sea-struck shore, And teeming valleys blurred by forge or mine; A new Dawn comes to shine. Scarce ten years since belov√®d hands long cold, Keen Brain and dauntless Will, Dowered thee, by patriot faith grown over-bold, With costlier gifts than gold. Led by our Prince, and by the Kingly arm, Safe from despite and harm; To-day a myriad scholars, waxing still, The shrines of Knowledge fill; Already in the Senate, centuries dumb, Bold Cymric voices come; Already in the Forum and the Mart, As in the unselfish healer's generous art, Wales plays her honoured part; And some too eager souls have fainted and are gone, But more go striving on. Beneath your shadow, strong historic towers, 'Tis well we meet to-day. The halls of learning rise, not far away. Be Strength with Knowledge ours. Our Prince, who late in many a stately town, Austral and Boreal, wore the gold-decked gown, Loves too the seaman's art which made us great, And yet shall save the State. 'Tis well his Consort comes to bear her part, Who stole an Empire's heart; Would that our young Hope came who shall bear sway On some far distant day, England's alike and ours in well-loved name, O'er Britain's power and fame. Dear Motherland, I dream yet may not see What loftier heights are thine in years to be; What larger destinies, what nobler ends, The Hidden Purpose sends! And having sung thee oft and loved thee long, Bring this last sheaf of song! A CORONATION ODE. Westminster Abbey, June 26, 1902. Sing, soaring voices, to a joyous tune, Mourning is done and pain; Peal, solemn organ-music, deep, sublime, For 'tis a joyous time! Shine forth serene, unclouded sun of June, To gild the dawning Reign; Hushed is the shriek of War. 'Tis Peace! 'tis Peace! Blest calm, endure, increase! To-day rejoicing Britain grieves no more! Resound, oh, reverend aisles, as oft before; Kneel, ermined nobles, kneel, fair jewelled train, As in our storied England past away; 'Tis a triumphant day! Eight centuries have fled Since the proud Conqueror's head Within these walls assumed the Kingly crown. Age after age, the imperious line Of strenuous monarchs, armed with Right Divine From sire to son, marched down; A little realm was theirs, inviolate, free, Fenced by tumultuous surges of the sea; But vexed long time by broils and civil strife, Maiming its nascent life. Too oft the axe grew red with noble blood, Rebellion swept the land, a blighting flood, Yeoman and Burgher, long impatient saw The Royal will o'erleap the bounds of Law; Last, riper Wisdom wielding temperate sway, Love rose and cast out Fear; Ruled by just Laws, 'tis Freedom to obey: Rejoice both high and low, be of good cheer: 'Tis a triumphant day! No narrow realm it is to-day we own, Our little Isle, hearing the call of Fate, Thro'valour and wise statecraft mightier grown, Assumes a loftier state, Bearing o'er trackless land and unknown sea The war-worn ensign of the Free; And tho' with heavier weight the Imperial crown, People and King bears down From all the earth, by Love's enchantments bound, New ampler Britains kneel in homage round Twin hemispheres to-day from palm to pine, In loyal love combine: Their sons with ours have borne and fought and died, Their graves lie side by side; The vassal East to swell the pageant brings Her feudatory Kings; Ruler and peoples humbly kneel and pray A blessing from the gracious hand Divine, Their vows they take within this hallowed shrine: 'Tis a triumphant day! Crown him, the Seventh of his Kingly name, Long time the stay and solace of our Queen, Who learned the precious lesson at her knee, Through love to rule the Free: Who, like his son, his boundless realm has seen, True Englishman, kind heart and provident brain, To raise the poor and weak, to soothe the sufferer's pain; Who swears to-day an oath with reverent awe To guard the inviolate law: Round whose ancestral throne in fair array, Children, and children's children kneel to-day. Be this his best reward, his purest fame, To have lived for duty; to have handed down Brighter, the untarnished crown; To have cherished all his people, small and great; To have built the Imperial State! And with pure gems serene of Queenly grace, Crown his fair Consort, whose ethereal face Sweet smile, and slender form half-girlish yet The hurrying years forget; For whom reluctant Time delays his wings, As down Life's perilous ways we watch her move A vestal Presence breathing faith and love, The mother of our Kings! Dread Lord Invisible, who rulest all, Prone at Thy feet we fall! On the sealed record of thy coming Age Purge clean our country's page: To-day upon each new-anointed head Be thy full Influence shed! Our little pomps, our pageants fleet and pass Like shadows in a glass: We fade as they, but Thou endurest still! Direct, confirm Thy servants' faltering will, With mutual faith and trust our souls inspire; Descend, O Lord, descend in tongues of fire! And, with Thy grace, bending benignant down, King, Queen, and People crown! PERIPETEIA. An Epode. ‚ÄúSing, soaring voices, to a joyous tune, Mourning is done and pain; Peal, solemn organ-music, deep, sublime, For 'tis a joyous time! Shine forth serene, unclouded sun of June, To gild the dawning Reign; Hushed is the shriek of War. 'Tis Peace! 'tis Peace! Blest calm, endure, increase! To-day rejoicing Britain grieves no more! Resound, oh, reverend aisles, as oft before; Kneel, ermined nobles, kneel, fair jewelled train, As in our storied England past away: 'Tis a triumphant day.‚Äù Such was our song. Ah! 'twas but yesterday The Princely guests, the Imperial Envoys, came. With festal light the vistas seemed to flame, And all the rosy, fluttering ways were loud With the admiring crowd. From morn to eve millions of loyal feet Paced the gay flower-hung street In endless innocent processions mild; The lowly father bore the wondering child; Grey head and gold, youth, maiden, girl, and boy Came filled with humble joy; Again blue skies and the unclouded sun, Our cares, our toils seemed done‚Äî When sudden, on the innumerable throng, Hushing the hum of mirth, the bursts of song, There broke a bitter cry of mortal pain, Flouting those futile splendours pale and dead, While that sore-tried and unanointed head Uncrowned must yet remain. Oh, unsubstantial pomps! Oh, pageants vain! Oh, seeming-wasted labours swept away! 'Twas no triumphant day! Thy power is over all, Mysterious Lord, Thine the dread ruling Sword! Ours to obey whatever Thy command. Yet stay Thy chastening hand! Restore Thy servant to his people's prayer! Beside his bed of pain, oh, be Thou there! And still with grace and mercy, bending down, King, Queen, and people crown! THE LAST PAGEANT. October 25th, 1902. The thin leaves hang withered and sere: the glory of Summer is gone Once again with the quick-fading year, the pageant sweeps on Through long lanes of labour-worn life; to the war-drums petulant beat Soldiers, sailors, returned from the Strife, pace with echoing feet. With sabre and cannon and lance, to rhythms of jubilant sound The battle-thinned squadrons advance through the myriads around. Then the conquering Generals come, a-glitter with stars and with lace‚Äî High and low, all for Britain and home, fronted Death, face to face. Last with regal splendour and state, King and Queen bowing low, side by side, He from perilous suffering, strong; she fair as a Bride. 'Twas well done! 'twas a true kingly thought fixed the People's high pageant to-day, Rememb'ring their fathers who fought in dim years fled away. The wreaths of Trafalgar still green, the Six Hundred who rode to their doom; Valiant deeds of the days that have been, crying loud from the tomb. Now 'tis Peace. On, dear Land to the end, fare on fearless of envious fate, Whatever the Future shall send, being just, be thou great! All is done. Nay, not all. Once again King and People together shall kneel, With deep thanks for deliverance from pain, which we speak not yet feel; To-morrow o'er sea and o'er land the voice of an Empire shall praise The Almighty Beneficent Hand that metes out our days. THE DAY OF PEACE. Christmas, 1902. Once more 'tis Peace again, After long war-worn years Of sickness, bloodshed, pain, And scarce-dried tears. Three times that Heavenly Birth Dawned 'mid War's darkest cloud: War shook the unquiet earth With thunders loud. But now at length, at last, Blest Peace returns again. Let not that suffering Past Be all in vain! Our England's martyrs sleep In every land and clime, Waiting in slumbers deep The knell of Time. Let that celestial Birth, Returning from the skies, Brighten the desolate hearth, The tear-dimmed eyes. Comfort the mourners' pain For dear lives which are not. With high hope soothe again Palace and cot. Bind thou, oh, blessed Peace, Ruler and ruled in one! Let love with law increase, And strife be done! Ah, not in vain shall be The blood like water shed, If truer Liberty Rise from the dead! Revolve, blest cycle, round Thro' many a bloodless year! But, hark, a threatening sound Wakes the old fear! Again our dreams seem vain, Faint fade our hopes and far; Not yet shall cease the pain, The curse of War! Haste, haste, oh, blessed hour, Which bids all sorrows cease: Come quickly, come with power, Oh, Prince of Peace! AT A FREE LIBRARY JUBILEE. Manchester, April 3rd, 1903. Here, hands long cold have reared a shrine Where weary frame and throbbing brain Musing 'mid garnered sheaves divine, May find forgetfulness of pain, And cares, and penury and toil; The mill's loud whirr, and stifling air; The din, the smoke, the dust, the soil, Which vex the workers everywhere; 'Neath spells of the Poetic Muse, Or Hers whose storied pages give The glamour which the Past renews And faults alike and glories live, Or Hers who feigns for girl and boy Bright dreams of Life, too fair for truth; The glow, the boundless hope, the joy; The innocent fantasies of Youth, Or keen Inventions precious store, Which made and keeps our England great, Or Civic Wisdoms temperate lore, Which knits the Freeman to the State, Or Hers, who fleeter far than wind, A tenth Muse, borne on lightning wings With every dawn, for all mankind Her new unfailing message brings. Free without price, for all who come, Here ripened harvests keep their gold. For peaceful thought, denied at home, Come all, come often, Young and Old! FROM A CLOISTER. I hate the narrow sunless wall, Which like a cold snake girdles round The cloistered convent fair and tall, But blind of sight, and dumb of sound, The prison-house so trim and gray Where life is only to obey. I dread the white cell, blank and bare, More ghostly than the blackest gloom Where morn and eve appear to stare, Dead phantom eyes, that presage doom; And that sad figure with bowed head Fixed to the wall above my bed, Whose mild eyes, full of sorrow, seem To gaze reproachful night and day, Till waking from some hopeless dream I see them in the dawning gray Bend on me still and seem to look Meek love and pitying rebuke. But most of all I dread the long Monotonous litanies of praise, The thick-fumed air, the weary song, From darkling dawns through glaring days, The Altars tricked with gold and gem, The Virgin with her diadem. The Virgin! Shall I dare to shame, I, who am caged and useless here, The Mother's sacred spotless name, Enshrined mid blameless memories dear? To this I kneel, not barren years Unlit by homely joys and tears. And He, her Son‚Äîsometimes I think‚Äî Heaven pity me!‚Äîthe pain He bore Was no more bitter cup to drink Than this dull ache and yearning sore. His pangs were brief, He left His Throne A little while to save His own. But we, what do we here who give Our empty lives, our weary years To make a lifeless dogma live Watered by floods of fruitless tears? Heaven gave the woman's loving heart, Man bids her pine alone, apart. Oft from the belfry-towers above The mad chimes peal out far and wide, And forth in gay procession move The wedded lovers side by side; Blithe children's faces fair and bright; Girl mothers baring bosoms white. And I am young and fair as they, Only a girl in age as yet, Though weary years have crept away Since that sad day I ne'er forget, When my young life seemed closed and done Almost before it was begun. Closed! Nay, but years may come and go And take all hope and youth away, But not this load of life. Ah no! Still shall I sicken as I pray, And wear and pine as I do now, Still fettered by a hateful vow. Till comes the end, and I shall lie At rest beside the chapel wall. Rest! If I heard the secret sigh, The tearful accents rise and fall From hearts like mine unfilled, unblest, Not Heaven itself could give me rest! But meantime I must bear the fate Which prisons, hopeless, heart and mind. One day I saw him at the gate, I heard the manly voice and kind. They lied! but nought can now remove The bars which make it sin to love. Yes, life is death and love is sin, Only a pallid ghost is left, A shadow of the glow within Of warmth and tenderness bereft, A thrill, a faint erotic flame Which flickers round the Sacred Name. Down! baseless edifice of deceit! Cease! counterfeit of Faith and Love! One day divided souls shall meet, One day the frozen waters move. Shine forth great Light, the blinded sky Seems dead, beam on us or we die. FOR A NEW YEAR. Hail, new-born year! For some, the last To link the Present with the Past; For some, a boundless tract which brings Vague promises of happier things. First milestone on the dawning way, Or last, half hid at close of day; For some, the blithe, ascending sun, For some, dim twilight well-nigh done. Shalt thou our country's weal increase Lapt in the halcyon calm of Peace? Or shall dark storm-clouds frown once more To mar our hopes, as oft before? New fruits of knowledge shalt thou give, And teach the multitudes to live? Shall Faith, with brighter, warmer fire, Men's wandering, doubting souls inspire? Shall strifes and jealousies again Blight in full ear thy ripening grain? And killing frost or furious wind Deface the victories of mind? Vain questionings! For waking eyes Each day a new sun lights the skies. The fateful drama of the year With every dawn that breaks is here. Life's year, no less than each brief day, Mounts to high noon, then wanes away; And whoso casts its horoscope Must wisely mingle fear with hope. Our little joys and sorrows pass Like fleeting shadows in a glass! Lift we our hearts, content to trust The Will that orders all is just. Light Thou our feet, blest Light, and we Will strive to follow patiently. Come joy or sorrow, toil or rest, Whate'er Thy will commands is best. Make us to worthier aims aspire, Purge out gross sense as if by fire; Spurn self, and daily seek to rise A hand's-breadth nearer to the skies. Then, whatsoe'er the years shall send, Where'er our feeble steps we bend, One Strength our weakness shall attend: The visible Presence of a Friend! FRANCE AND ENGLAND. 1903, 1904. What means this eager crowd, These blended ensigns gay, These echoing plaudits loud, This jubilant day? And who this honoured guest, Welcomed with regal state, Who by no crown opprest, Shows doubly great? He comes because at last, Rising to newer life, From senseless hatreds past, And age-long strife. From mute mistrusts accurst, Than bloodshed deadlier far, Which smoulder till they burst In flaming war; Two gracious sisters strong, Who half a world should sway, By discord severed long, Draw near to-day. Rulers have come before, Driven from a tottering throne, Sad exiles to our shore, Forlorn, alone. But this man claims to hold The people's strength, the might Of her, we fought of old In stubborn fight. Soon, soon, may old strifes be For ever laid asleep, Beneath the estranging sea Sunk fathom-deep. Fly, blended ensigns, fly Long, not in peace unfurled, But warlike rivalry O'er all the world. Waving thy magic wand, Spirit of Peace advance, And touch with healing hand, England and France. Fair sisters twain, away With jealous hates and fears! The long nights clouds and tears! 'Tis Dawn, 'tis Day! GAUDEAMUS. An Anniversary of Commerce. February, 1904. 'Tis twenty busy years to-day Since first our venturous galleon came 'Mid the thronged fleets, which barred her way, Unknown, unheralded by fame. 'Tis twenty years! With what swift change Sunshine and storm succeed in life, What new adventurous fortunes strange, Vicissitudes of calm and strife! Since first our bold bark's sails were spread To seek‚Äîand caught‚Äîthe favouring breeze, England, her bravest blood has shed By shores unknown, o'er far-off seas. The Nile's hot sands, the veldt's lone plain, With those enriching streams grew red, While long disastrous years in vain Our country mourned her valorous dead. And now, the perilous struggle o'er, England a wider Empire stands Victorious, waxing more and more Thro' provident brains and dauntless hands. Have we no part in all, because Our sole work is the work of peace? Who, armed with economic laws Would fain the nation's store increase? Is commerce weaker than the sword? To spread the empery of mind, The strength of the Eternal Word Preaching goodwill to all mankind? Brings peaceful knowledge meaner gain Than the red blade of ancient hate? Comes white-winged Industry in vain To teach the savage to grow great? Our ships throng thick on every sea, Our labouring towns light many a shore; 'Tis peaceful Commerce bids them be And spreads our Britain more and more. Boasts Commerce less of Fancy's grace, The Power that saves than that which slays? Should the shy muse avert her face From any save the warrior's praise? Or should true patriot singers give No ear to aught but fables old, Tho' commerce 'tis that bids us live, And labour thrives on gathered gold? Hail, peaceful Power, which yet shall bind The Realm, the Race, securer still, Peoples drawn nearer, heart and mind In union and consentient will. Hail, gains of science: sail through air, Great navies scorning wave and wind! Stream viewless Influence everywhere, Swift as speeds thought within the mind! Throw wide new doors for honest gain! Let banded wealth with wealth compete, Wise caution and foreseeing brain Spurning the meanness of deceit. Not ours to point to perilous ways Worse than the hazard of the die; Not ours the reckless chance to praise, Nor heed the ruined orphan's cry! Whate'er thy fate great Realm, indeed Our humble part we claim to bear, Strong in the faith of Honour's creed, Prudent to keep, yet bold to dare! FROM A COUNTRY JOURNAL. A True Story. This is the tale of sacrifice That 'mid dull chronicles of war, Sedition, scandal; party cries, News from the parish, news from far; Hidden as a vernal violet; Beneath thick weeds of commonplace, In some obscurer corner set, Lit the dull sheet with native grace: A little lad twelve winters old Had seen his ruined father die, Leaving his helpless orphans, cold, Hunger, and rags, and misery. Pent in a squalid garret lay His ailing mother with her brood, Nor could his scanty earnings pay The daily cost of fire and food. Long time their suffering wrung his heart, Till flashed on him a bold device, And doubting not, he chose his part Of simple childish sacrifice. Then wrote he thus, ‚ÄúOh, Mother dear, Bid them come quick in search of me, Not far away am I, but near Where the deep dock shuts out the sea. I could not bring my weekly wage, For in a strange shop yesterday, Taking an unaccustomed way, I found displayed a tempting page, Which said that, all who bought therein Would gain their money fifty-fold When they were dead‚ÄîIt seemed no sin, To stake my life against the gold. I bought a little cap, a belt, And such a knife‚Äîyou will forgive, I know, what I have done: I felt Content to die, if you might live. So from my pocket, mind you take The ticket which secures the gold, Buy food, and fire, and for my sake, Eat and be warmed, though I lie cold. Dear Mother, do not spend the sum On useless mourning, nor be sad, But stoop and kiss me when I come, Remembering your little lad.‚Äù Poor child! brave helper! innocent guile! Which moves the tear, that checks the smile, Poor scheme, which could not turn to gain, Vain sacrifice! ah, nay! not vain!! IN MEMORIAM. Vicar Pritchard of Llandovery, Author of Canwyll y Cymry. Dear saint, whose homely lamp of verse divine, Long centuries our heavenward feet did guide, In thy loved church, renewed and amplified, We rear to thee, as in our hearts, a shrine. DE SENECTUTE. What is it to grow old? Is it the bleaching hair, Dim eyes, slow limbs and cold Where once quick pulses were? Numbed, waning energies, Low springs of life which freeze, These ills age brings indeed; but there are worse than these. Faith that no more may burn, Yearnings that sink and die; Shafts that to earth return, Scorning the elusive sky; Content which climbs no more The white peaks loved before; Bright visions lost with youth, which nought can now restore. The glowing love of Right Quenched by Time's gradual chill, The eye that shuns the light, The hesitating will; The once clear gaze devout Blinded by clouds of doubt Wherein sun, moon, and stars fade gradually out. Yet not alone with loss Of strenuous heart and brain Age comes, and bears its cross Of failure and of pain; The ebbing tide of sense, Purging Time's long offence, Leaves the worn soul once more made clean in innocence. To thrill with tender ruth For weak lives, old and young; To vindicate the truth With dauntless pen and tongue; Still to ensue the Right Bearing the world's despite‚Äî This is the crown of Age that mounts thro' Love to Light. THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LEO THE ARMENIAN. (EMPEROR OF ROME.) A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS. DRAMATIS PERSON√Ü.Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Mich. read Michael For Emp. read Empress Leo, the Armenian. Emperor of Rome. Michael, the Amorian. His brother soldier and supplanter. Theodotus, the Patriarch. Theodore of Studium. Captains of the Army‚ÄîPriests‚ÄîTwo Conspirators‚ÄîMonks‚ÄîGaoler‚ÄîCitizens of Byzantium. The Empress. Helena, a Lady of Honour. Children of the Empress. ACT I. SCENE I.‚ÄîA Tent, near Byzantium. Night. Michael; afterwards Leo. Michael. At last I see The prize within my grasp. To-morrow's dawn Finds Rome arrayed against the opposing hosts To conquer or to fall. If she should conquer Then were the Emperor's throne fixed on a rock And I obscure for ever. Should some panic Force back her arms, 'twere otherwise; the bolt Which spares the lowly saplings of the wood Shatters the heaven-topped pine; the angry people Letting their vengeance fall on C√¶sar's head Would spare his generals,‚Äîwhen he is gone, And his throne empty, who remains but I, The darling of the army, the brave Captain Of twenty fights? Shall it be Aplaces, That hot-brained fool, without a thought in life Only to hack and thrust? My comrade Leo? That cold half-blooded pedant, with his babble Of duty to the State; half saint, half sage, And no-wise soldier, he who stole my love‚Äî I hate him‚Äîhe to step 'twixt me and power? Nay, that he shall not‚ÄîI am no mere creature Of pure philanthropies and cloistered virtues, But a strong soldier willing to dare all To compass my desire. See, here he comes, The hypocrite! I hate him! Good night, comrade. Is't well with thee? What think you of the morrow? Will victory be ours? It should be surely, We do out-number them. Leo. Michael, I know not What fortune keeps for us; but this I know, Some boding presage of impending ill Weighs down my soul, and will not let me rest. I see before my eyes our Roman hosts Driven backwards, and the fierce barbarian levies Press onward, and the Imperial Crown of Rome Tottering on C√¶sar's brow, and a strange voice Crying of ‚ÄúTreason, Treason!‚Äù day and night, ‚ÄúBeware of traitors!‚Äù Mich. Comrade, thou art dreaming. What traitors are there here? not thou and I, Nor Aplaces; and if not we, what other? We are the Generals. Leo. Nay, not Aplaces. I see him bathed in blood, his men surrounded And dying where they stand. Mich. Then who was it Who played the traitor, comrade, thou or I? Leo. Speak not thus, Michael; think of the old days When we were boys together, our young hearts Filled with high dreams of a regenerate Rome. Could we from such high thoughts sink down so low, Now in our golden Mid-summer of life, As Treason? God forbid. For Aplaces No truer, loyal heart, or braver soldier E'er faced the foeman's steel. Mich. Ah, that is well. He leads the van to-morrow. If victory Smile on him, then he need not play the traitor. 'Tis certain ere to-morrow night has come The army, which is now your Kingmaker, Will thrust the dotard C√¶sar from his throne And set this paragon there. Leo. Aplaces‚ÄîC√¶sar? Aplaces, set himself before his country? Nay, nay, you do not know him. We have fought Together twenty years, and though no bond Of close necessitude links us, such as binds Michael to me, yet are we comrades too, Welded in one, at the fierce forge of war, And knit by common perils. I would answer For Aplaces with life. Mich. It may be, comrade, That thou art right; but hast thou pondered well, Thou who so hatest the idolatrous crew Who come 'twixt thee and God, what power it is Lurks behind Aplaces? The Priest's‚Äînone other! Dost thou not know that in his warlike tent The sacred ikons meet his waking eyes The ikons watch his sleep, the crucifix Through all the storms of battle next his heart Wards off the foemen's steel? Dost thou not know How gloomy he has been of late, how full Of boding dread, of sick remorseful fancies And superstitious fears? Dost thou not know 'Tis in such rugged penitent souls that priest-craft Finds its best prey? What hope you for the Empire If he, his brave soul whistled down the wind To the idolater's lure, should, at a sign Of his masters, stoop and tear the bleeding heart Of the true Faith, and in its stead enthrone Some base corruption? Leo. Michael, dost thou speak Of vague suspicions or of certain proof? Such doubts unman me. Mich. Leo, I have spoken Of certain proof, which shortly I will show thee; But now too great a danger presses us. We must defeat him and his priestly crew. Far better the Bulgarian than the Priest! Leo. Nay, what Is it thou would'st? The proofs! the proofs! Mich. I have a letter from the Patriarch To whom he makes confession; this a creature Of mine has intercepted. In it they plot That if to-morrow fortune crowns our arms Some trusty officers among the army Shall straight acclaim him C√¶sar, and the Empire Be his to make or mar. Leo. Michael, I hate These gross idolatrous knaves, but am a soldier And know a soldier's duty. Mich. What is there That doth conflict with this in what I would? Thou knowest that Aplaces commands to-morrow The Thracian and the Macedonian levies Filled with young northern soldiers, and the flower Of all the Imperial host. For thee and me Soft Asiatics, prone to coward panics, Peril our name and fame. Were it not well For the Empire if the brunt of battle fell On those most fit to bear it? Let them first Take all the onset, while we hold reserved The troops, too weak to attack indeed, but able To end what is begun. If Aplaces Should force the foemen back, then it were ours To crown his victory. If he should fail, We hold our troops unbroken to push back The weakened enemy. In either fortune We save the Empire, whether from the Priest Or the Bulgarian. Leo. Michael, I dare not. There is no rule but duty; serving men, We serve God best. Mich. Good comrade, sleep on it. Thou mays't serve both. Thou art not thyself to-night. Take time, the dawn to-morrow sees the onset, Heaven keep thee safe. Leo. Michael, I care no whit Whether I live or die; but Aplaces, If he be what thou sayest (and who shall doubt it), Would ruin Rome. For these Bulgarian robbers We hold them safe‚Äîagain, if not to-morrow It matters not, but an Idolater Fixed on the throne of Rome, it were too much! It must not be! But what if he should fall In the unsupported onset? Mich. Nay, he will not; He is too strong for them! Leo. But for his levies! How doom those brave young lives? Mich. As for his levies; Why, what are soldiers, if they face not peril A soldier dies but once! Leo. Shall he then fall? And shall I be a traitor to the State? Was this my dream‚ÄîAplaces bathed in blood; And voices calling ‚ÄúTreason‚Äù? I cannot bear it! I will have none o't! Mich. Nay, but Aplaces On C√¶sar's throne, the truth of Christ o'erborne By dark idolatries! Leo. Nay, call me Traitor, Dyed with a thousand treasons to the State, But faithful to my God! Mich. (aside). I have him safe, And the Empire in my grasp! SCENE II.‚ÄîThe Field of Battle. Alarms and Excursions. Michael, Leo, Roman Captains and Soldiers. 1st Captain. The day is lost‚Äîthe fierce Bulgarian hosts. Press on us everywhere. Fly, comrades, fly For safety, ere they take us, and their horsemen Transfix us as we flee. The Emperor Has fled the field long since, the Roman power Is broken in pieces. 2nd Capt. Comrades, we are betrayed. Some cursed treachery has done this thing, Not the Bulgarian strength. Our Generals Are traitors. Where was Michael, the Amorian, With all his men, while the brave Aplaces, Hurled his stout Macedonians on the front Of the Bulgarian host? He is no coward, Therefore the more a traitor. Where was Leo, The Armenian, and his force? I cannot doubt him. He is too true a soldier, but I fear Lest Michael has beguiled him. 1st Capt. Stay not, comrade. Save thyself! All is lost! [Exeunt‚Äîhurriedly. Enter Michael and Leo. Mich. All has gone well; Aplaces is disgraced; the Emperor Fled to Byzantium, and our routed host Flings down its arms, and all the country side Is sown with swords and shields. Leo. My dream! My dream! And was it I that did this treachery? I who have fought by Aplaces' side so oft? The van driven back, the arms of Rome disgraced? It must not be. Nay, Michael, I must go. It is not too late. I will to horse, and rally The shattered van-guard. Michael, do thou take Thy men and stay the torrent. Lose no moment. Follow while there is time. Mich. Stay, Leo, stay! 'Tis useless. All is lost. Dost thou forget Our compact? Leo. Nay, I was a fool, a villain, To listen. 'Tis no compact which can bind An honest soldier; treason, blood-shed, murder, Nought else. Nay, I must go, and thou wilt follow. Is it not so, Michael? Prithee lose no moment. All may be saved. Think of brave Aplaces! I will fling myself on those barbarian hosts, And save the van. [Exit‚Äîhurriedly. Mich. Fool, fool! Insensate fool! Gulled by a tale too weak to cheat a child. Go thou, then, to thy death. My path is clear, I have no rival now. The Emperor Has fled, and I am Emperor of Rome. Soon I will count with those Bulgarian thieves. I will not leave one of the curs√©d crew To trouble us again. When I am C√¶sar, As now I must be, for the army loves me Beyond all others, I will straight take measures With the Priests, with the army, with each power that comes Betwixt me and my will. [Exit Michael. [A noise of shouting heard. Leo re-enters, borne back by soldiers. 1st Capt. Nay, General, It is too late, but we have seen thy valour! If valour could have saved us, then wert thou Saviour of Rome; but 'twas too late, too late! Thou could'st not more than man. Comrades, behold Your General who dared all things for you, Who, when the fierce Bulgarian charged and broke Upon you like a flood, and over-whelmed The struggling van, like some tall sea-beat rock Stood steadfast with his levies, and beat back The onward rushing surge, but now, God wot It is too late to win; not even Leo Could save us; the dull bigot whom ill Fate Thrust on the throne of C√¶sar, long has fled The blood-stained field, we have no chief but Leo; He is our C√¶sar! Leo. Nay, but Aplaces, Who has ta'en the glory of the day; I would give My life to be as he. He is your C√¶sar, No other! What is victory or glory To loyal duty? I would liefer take Aplaces‚Äîwho had dared and lost his all, But kept his duty, than the laurelled head Of a too cautious soldier, who has kept His fame but lost his honour. 1st Capt. Such as is Michael the Amorian. 2nd Capt. Where in truth was he, Michael the bravest soldier of his time, First in a score of fights? I tell you, comrade, I marked him and his levies. Not a blade Of theirs e'er crossed the foemen's. When they saw Brave Aplaces o'erborne they did not stir, And when men asked why thus they stood inactive, They said, with broken voices hoarse with rage, ‚ÄúOur General has ordered.‚Äù When the rout Bore down on them, they advanced not, nor stood firm, As Leo, but in orderly array They got them to the rear, and now have reached Half way to Adrianople. 1st Capt. Treason! Treason! And Michael is the traitor. Leo. Ah, my dream! Nay, nay, you are mistaken. Let me go. I will save Aplaces! 1st Capt. Nay, General, It is too late! Leo. It is not too late, I say, Let me to horse! Enter Soldier in flight. Soldier. Good comrades all, I pray you Hearken, what dreadful news I have to tell. The brave John Aplaces and all around him Are slain; I saw them fall. I saw his body, When Leo's men pressed the Bulgarians back, Lie bathed in blood, pierced by a dozen spears, And savage sword cuts. Leo. Oh, my dream! My dream! Oh Aplaces, my comrade Aplaces, I would I were as thou! 1st Capt. Nay, thou art Rome's, And thou alone canst save her. Comrades all, I do proclaim our sole remaining leader, Leo the Armenian, who has kept his faith, C√¶sar of Rome! Soldiers. We do acclaim thee C√¶sar. Enter Michael. Leo. Nay, nay, you know not all‚ÄîI will not take it; I am a simple soldier, vowed to duty, Or once I was! and would continue in it. I do refuse your homage, kneel not to me! But to dead Aplaces. A Soldier. We do acclaim thee C√¶sar of Rome. See, there the traitor stands! Seize him, and kill him, comrades, let him die A traitor's death. Mich. (aside). Leo, if thou art C√¶sar Thou mayest save me. If thou dost reject The proffered homage, but a single word And thou wilt never more see wife nor child; I will denounce thee. Leo. Nay, I care not, Michael, For death, thou knowest. Soldiers, Citizens, Be not thus rash! I pray you let not grief Make you unjust. If C√¶sar you will have me, Who am less worthy than the meanest footman Who marches in your ranks‚Äîthus let it be. I take the unwelcome gift. For this our comrade, Michael, I do believe that he is loyal As he was ever brave. If I accept The crown your favour offers, I will make Full inquest of this thing. If any show Unfaithful to the State, then shall I purge them With fitting punishment. Mich. I do surrender My sword to you, my liege, and kneel before you, A suppliant for justice. Soldiers. Long live Leo! Long live our Emperor! We will proclaim him In Saint Sophia's! ACT II. SCENE I.‚ÄîLeo's Palace, Byzantium. Leo. One little week has passed since the great fight Which wrecked the power of Rome, the fight which found me An honourable soldier, but has left me Dishonoured and a murderer at heart, But Emperor of Rome! How small appears The Imperial Crown, Earth's highest dignity To him who by deceit has climbed to it! This is the way the tempter knows to take The struggling souls of men,‚Äîholds forth to the eye Some glittering bauble, which secured by blood, Turns straight to dross, leaving the longing wretch Without the gain he sinned for, and his soul Stained ineffaceably. I swear by the saints I never nursed a wish for this sad gift Of power which weighs me down, I knew too well Envy's sharp tooth, the deep anxieties Which round the ruler's head set piercing thorns, As sharp as Calvary's. I do affirm I never aimed at power, yet did consent To do what led me to it, since I knew That Aplaces enthroned would ruin Rome! I am innocent of that, but am I guiltless Of blood? Nay, that I am not! Oh, my God! When the loud anthems echoed through the dome Of St. Sophia's, through the throng of priests The rolling perfumed clouds, the kneeling people, I saw my dream, which was a dream no more, But mournful truth. My comrade Aplaces Betrayed through me! I heard a ghastly voice Out-ringing all the music, crying, ‚ÄúTreason!‚Äù And who then was the traitor? Was it I? Nay, nay, I never willed it. Was it Michael? My friend from boyhood? Nay, what has he gained? Nothing! While I have reaped a crown, am C√¶sar, And rule the fate of Rome. Gain, did I say? Oh, would that I might sleep unbroken sleep, As then I did, ere this sad load of sin Lay heavy on my soul, making life anxious And full of boding fears. One little week Has passed, no more, the fierce Bulgarian still Is at our gates, flushed with the mis-won triumph Which treachery has gained him. How shall I, I, a poor wretch, whose conscience makes him coward, Lead Rome against the foe? I cannot do it. The ghosts of Aplaces and his dead soldiers, Slain by no fault but mine, forbid it. Michael May know some politic art to save the city; I'll summon him. Without, there! Summon hither Michael the Amorian. Though his enemies Denounce his crafty temper, yet I know him, A friend of ancient times, and though he shares With me the guilt of murdered Aplaces, I do believe it was his noble hate Of priestcraft and corrupt idolatries Which did mislead him. Who am I to accuse His treason?‚ÄîI, who profit by his sin, Who have gained all he might? Enter Michael, with low obeisance. Nay, Michael, kneel not, We are old comrades. Mich. Nay, most puissant C√¶sar, I am a soldier only, and do kneel Where fealty is due. Leo. Rise! I ennoble thee, Patrician of Rome! Mich. C√¶sar, I thank thee For this unhoped-for honour, and I swear To be thy servant, always. Leo. Nay, good Michael, I would not have thee servant, only friend, As of old time. Mich. Leo, my inmost soul Is touched with gratitude to thee and thine. Command me to what service thou desirest, To the cost of life I'll do it. Leo. I know well How fertile in resource thou art, how grave Our present peril looms. The fierce Bulgarian, Thanks to our grievous error, presses hard Upon our city itself. Mich. Leo, 'tis true The enemy press on us, thousands strong, From the Blachernian to the Golden Gate, And like the Goth and Hun of older Rome, Are thundering at our doors. Leo. And can we meet them And drive them hence? Mich. Nay, that indeed we cannot, The spirit of our men is for the present So crushed by sharp defeat; a score Bulgarians Would rout the arms of Rome. Leo. Then are we ruined And sunk beyond recall. Mich. I said not so. There are other means than arms to drive them hence. They dare not press us further, their rough warriors Are anxious for their homes‚Äîthere comes some sickness, Which on their ill-fed levies falling, widens The gaps which war has made. I do believe That they would rise to any painted lure That Rome might set before them. Leo. Any lure! Would'st have us break our word? Mich. Nay, we would meet them And settle terms of peace. Leo. Ay, that were well, The Empire must have peace to recreate Its wasted strength, which never had been broken But for our act. Mich. Nay, nay, my gracious lord. It was foredoomed to fall and rise again To nobler heights. Leo. Michael, I would that this Were as thou sayest; but what terms of peace Would these Bulgarian rebels, flushed with triumph, Accept of weakling Rome? Mich. It matters little. All would be well. Be sure the Conference Would fix good terms for Rome. Leo. The Conference? How mean you? Mich. That an embassy go hence To the Bulgarian camp, and do propose An armistice. Upon the Roman side The Emperor and half a score of magnates, While the Bulgarian King and nobles meet us With like equipment, in some neutral place And settle terms. Leo. But will they give us terms? Mich. I do not know indeed; but if they do not We have no force to make them. Leo. If they will not? Mich. Then Rome is ruined. What then shall we do? There is no course but one, and that I know not If thou wilt take; but were I in thy stead, Master of Rome, it were not long in doubt. Leo. What would you have? Mich. I hold all means are lawful Against these robbers who invade our peace, Whom now an undeserved good fortune makes Masters of Rome. Think, Leo, think, I pray you! What bloody insults, and unmeasured rapine Your peaceful people, all unused to war, Are suffering at your doors, what if they force Our gates and carry death and cruel outrage To our uncounted myriads, and Rome sinks In a pit of blood and fire, and thou should'st die, Last of the C√¶sars! Leo. Nay, it must not be. 'Tis from our fault it comes. It must not be. Nay, nay, it must not be. Mich. Then have thou courage. There is one way alone. When these Bulgarians. Meet us, as I have said, their King and nobles. Amongst them, thou knowest well in that rude people The King and Chiefs are, brain and sinew and arm, Without which they are nought. Leo. Thou speak'st in riddles; What would'st thou? Mich. This! The King and chiefs are all; The people without these are scattered sheep. Take measures then, when this convention ends, Let their strength end with it. Leo. Michael, I know not Even now what thou would'st do. Mich. I would set upon them And kill them to a man! Leo (drawing his sword). Thou most deceitful And traitorous of men! Would'st have me stain My honour thus. Quick, draw, defend thyself, Ere my sword pierce thee through. Mich. Nay, kill me, C√¶sar, So I save Rome. Leo. Treachery! Treason! Murder! What warps thy nature thus? Mich. What do I gain If I am traitor? 'Tis for Rome alone, Not for myself. Can others say the same Who have gained all‚ÄîI nought? Leo. That we have erred I know, but never did I dream our error Would thus imperil Rome. I trusted thee When thou saidst Aplaces was the Priests' creature. I compassed not his death, but his disgrace; But now I know how great a sin it is To swerve from duty. Mich. Then 'tis pity truly Thou didst not sift my tale, for this is sure, I was misled in thinking Aplaces Was the Priests' creature. Leo. Oh, perfidious wretch, Is my soul stained for this? Mich. Howe'er it be, At least 'tis by our fault Rome lies in peril, And ours it is to save her. Would'st redress Thy wrong? The way lies open. Leo. Leave my presence. Thy words dishonour me. Mich. Ay, but remember One way there is to save Rome, that I show thee. There is no other. If the fate of Rome Move thee not, nor thy own, I pray you ponder What fate awaits our innocent citizens. What thy loved wife and children, if the fierce Bulgarians sack thy palace, or some soldier, Less full of brain-sick scruples, seize thy crown And beat the foeman back. Thou knowest our manners. Would'st have thy boys unmanned and thy young daughters Cribbed in a life-long cloister, and their mother A household drudge, or pining, poor and exiled? Wilt thou not save thy loved ones and thy country? Leo. (hiding his face). There is no other way! Help me, oh God! SCENE II.‚ÄîThe Empress. A Room in the Palace. Empress. I would I were a soldier's wife again, Far from these palace-splendours and the pomp Of heralds and the load of ceremony That weighs down C√¶sar's wife, for when we lived In modest state, my husband, with each night Slept dreamless sleep, but now, good though he is And full of care for others, the long hours Creep slowly to the dawn, and I can hear His wakeful sighs, and see his face with day More haggard than before. I think he is Too noble for a throne, too touched with ruth For this sad world's sad burden, too much filled With thoughts of heaven for earthly happiness. A saint, a martyr, yet even this, methinks, Fails to explain his secret, or the weight Of deep despondency which presses down His spotless soul, nor yet our perilous case Fronting the foe, who thunder at our gates Since the brave Aplaces fell. To-day there goes An embassy to meet the arrogant foe, And yet he throws not off his load. Heaven send, 'Twas no foreboding fear of treachery From these barbarian levies, that oppressed His spotless soul. I weary for his coming; He is too good for men, and yet I know I could not love him, were his soul less free From earthly taint. But here I see there comes A kindred soul to his; a faithful comrade, Michael the Amorian, whom he hath ennobled. (How short a time it seems‚Äîthey were my suitors, And Leo won.) I will inquire of him How goes the embassy. Enter Michael. My Lord Patrician, I give you welcome. It is long years since we met Mich. Illustrious lady, at your feet I kneel as I knelt once when we were young. I am your servant still. Emp. Rise, sir, I pray you, For you are, by the Emperor's grace, remember, Ennobled now. Mich. Nay, Madam, to the woman I kneel, and not the Empress, and should kneel Were I the Emperor's self. Emp. My lord, a truce To courtesies. I know you love my husband; Have you good news of him? He went to-day To the Bulgarian camp with all his Court To settle terms of peace. Will he succeed? Will he save Rome? These foemen press so near Our close beleaguered city, that I know not If aught but failure waits him. For a wife The safety of the State is much indeed, But her lord's safety more. I do not know But sometimes I have thought some secret load Weighs on him, which not all the cares of State Could lay on him or take from him. Dost know What fortune has in store? Mich. Illustrious lady, I cannot doubt his triumph, he has taken Such means to capture fortune, that she lies A prisoner in his toils. Emp. But comes there not Some doubt to give you pause? Mich. Nay, how to doubt? We are too subtle for these blustering braggarts, And subtlety is power. Emp. My lord, you err. My husband is as ever, brave and true, But simple as a child. Mich. Ay, so he was, But statecraft grows with need, till the rude soldier Grows cunning as a Priest. Emp. My husband cunning! There breathes no purer spirit. Mich. Ay, dear lady, There thou art right, But not the less his statecraft, For I have known his purpose, will commend His wisdom when 'tis known. I do approve His daring project. I would keep no faith With the enemies of Rome. Emp. Leo break faith? What mean your words, sir? Mich. Nay, there is no faith Where is not freedom. These Bulgarian robbers Invade our borders, sack our cities, lead Our citizens the citizens of Rome‚Äî To slavery. By some mad stroke of fortune, They rout our bravest General and press Close on our homes. What honourable peace Can come from such? The Emperor goes forth To treat, Taking his life as in his hands. Were it not well to trim the balance thus That if they will not do the right they should, Rome should be safe? Emp. I do not grasp your thought. Mich. Nay, it is this. If the Bulgarian hosts Retire within their borders it is well, But if they will not, then the Emperor Has taken measures that the King and Chiefs Shall trouble us no more. Emp. What, in fair fight? Mich. Yes, fair, since any fight is fair which meets Such villainy as theirs. May be indeed It is a new device, and, truth to tell, My clumsy soldier-wit had ne'er devised it, Or, if it had, had shrunk from it. But now 'Tis too late to turn back. Ask me no more. The Emperor is doubtless safe and Rome, And all our foemen scattered. 'Tis enough; He will be back to-morrow. [Exit Michael. Emp. I would rather Beg bread from door to door, see my loved children In rags, than that my love should soil his honour Even for Imperial Rome! Enter Leo in confusion and haste. Emp. My love, what ails thee? Leo. Defeat‚Äîdisgrace, Dishonour. Touch me not, I am not fit To look upon thy face. They did persuade me To that I knew was wrong, and now I come With hands unstained indeed, but a stained heart. Keep from me, wife. Emp. What is it that has been? Hast thou then broken faith? Leo. Ay, that I have. And nothing but the accident of fortune Saved the Bulgarian King and all his Court. Emp. From massacre? My love, I cannot bear it To think thee false. What is it that has been? Leo. Wife, it is this. Some one‚ÄîI say not who‚Äî False friend, far worse than enemy, o'erbore My will and did persuade me by an ambush To take the enemy. A sudden onset Broke on our conference. The King and Court Took horse and fled, and then, returning, chased me Even to the walls, and now they sack and burn The palaces without and all the churches. St. Mamas' reeks with blood‚Äîthe citizens Are taken in slavery, and we are helpless, And presently the fierce Bulgarian levies Will sit down at our gates and we shall starve Like rats in a cage. Wife, I have sinned in vain, My soul and Rome are lost. Emp. I know not yet Thy meaning as I would, but oh, my love, If thou hast sinned indeed, full well I know It was not for thyself. Leo. Ay, that it was not, But not the less I sinned. The blood I shed not But would have shed by treachery, cries out Not less aloud to Heaven. Emp. If thou hast erred Thou hast not erred alone‚Äîthy comrade Michael Approves thy fault. Leo. What, did he speak of it, The villain? Emp. Ay, he did indeed, and dared Defend thy honour‚Äîfor the secret plan He praised but might not tell me. But my love, Rejoice that thou hast failed. Surely 'twas Heaven Hindered thy sin's fulfilment and would keep thee Guiltless of blood. Repent, my soul! Bethink thee, Dishonour is not statecraft, victory Can wound more deep than failure if it come Divorced from right! 'Tis wrong to do for others That which for self dishonours. But remember, I love thee still, and know thee as thou art, Whate'er the world may deem. Leo. Thou perfect woman, I kneel before thy truth. Emp. Nay, dearest, rather Brace high thy heart and soul‚Äîmeet in fair fight These barbarous foemen, and, if Heaven will have it, Conquer, and save thy Empire, and forget Thy sin, which was not done, as Heaven forgets it. Rouse thyself! Be a C√¶sar as thou wert, And save our Rome again! Leo. Dear wife, thy word Breathes life. I will obey. The Emperor Forgets his sin, and will go forth undaunted To battle for his people. The fond husband Loves deeper than before. The stain√©d soul With penance and with vigils, will lay bare Its mortal sin to Heaven. Emp. My heart! My love! ACT III. SCENE I.‚ÄîA Room in the Palace. The Empress; afterwards Michael. Emp. How slowly comes the dawn to watching eyes! How goes the fight? Last night as midnight struck My husband and his army issued forth, From out the western gates, hoping to take The foemen unawares, and now the morning Has come and brought no news, only a glare Of fire upon the sky and shouts and cries Of victory and pain, but nothing certain Has reached the city. Oh that I might see My love again unharmed. But as I hope, Whether untouched he come or wounded sore, He will have cast from him the weary load Which weighed upon his soul. To have him thus Were happiness enough. Enter Servant. Ser. My gracious liege, There comes a Captain from the field who brings Good news. Emp. Let him appear. Enter Captain. Cap. My liege, I bring Good tidings. The Bulgarian force has fled Before the Emperor, in shameful rout With dreadful slaughter. Our victorious forces Chase them in hot pursuit. The Emperor Returns ere long, letting his Generals Deal with the wretches, and will soon give thanks At St. Sophia's. Emp. God be praised for this. Heaven has forgiven his sin. Enter Michael. Mich. Good news, dear lady, For Rome and for thyself. The Emperor Is safe and cometh soon. Ah, happy man Whom a fond wife and gracious children wait To smooth his careworn brow. Such precious fate Might have been mine long since, but adverse fortune Blighted my hope. Emp. My lord, I well remember Thy fealty and do thank thee, but young love Is tyrannous and drives out all besides; Let us be friends. Mich. Nay, never, lady! Never! Or less or more. Emp. You do forget yourself, And what a loyal friend and subject owes His Sovereign and his friend. Mich. Ah, friend no more, But loyal subject still. Emp. Why not his friend? Tho' I remember well on that sad day Of our defeat he spoke impatient words Of thee and thy design. Mich. Me?‚ÄîMy design? Art jesting, lady? Emp. Sir, 'tis solemn truth. Mich. He had no cause But I have much. I could record a tale Of treachery which would make thy cheek grow pale, Dared I to give thee pain. Emp. Whose treachery; My husband's? Mich. Ay, good lady, and no other's. Emp. I do disdain to hear. Nay, sir, say on What have your lips to say against a man The noblest I have known? Mich. You know his trouble; You know his careworn visage‚Äîhis confession Of sin, his sleepless nights‚Äîhis load of sorrow. Emp. Nay, Heaven! 'tis true He did confess it, though I grasped it not. Something hath been of which it doth repent him, And I have marked his pain; but know he was The tempted, not the tempter. Is't not so, Michael? I do conjure thee by the love You bore me once, tell me by all the saints What is it that has been? Mich. I can but answer. Such words are a command. What would you know? Emp. The cause of his unrest. Mich. Oh, awful power Of conscience which doth rack the sinful head Beneath the Imperial Crown! I cannot do it. Have me excused. Emp. Nay, sir, I am your Sovereign. Mich. Have I your word to keep all undivulged? Emp. The Empress breaks not faith. Mich. Madam, your husband Betrayed his comrade Aplaces to death With all his men, at the great fight, and wherefore? That he might reign, and you. When at the gates The fierce Bulgarian raged, and all his sin Seemed fruitless, he devised a crafty plot By which our men should at a given signal Fall on the King and all his train. I prayed him By all our ancient friendship, by the love I bore you while I might, to keep his soul Unstained, by such gross sin. Better defeat, Disgrace, a ruined Empire, prison, exile, Nay death, than such dishonour. But he listened As one who hears not‚Äîwent his way, and failed, As he deserved. Emp. Oh, it is true! all true! And is this treacherous wretch my love, my dear, My spotless martyr? Mich. Spotless martyr, say you? Nay, murderer in act and thought, imbued With floods of innocent blood! Emp. Ah, Heaven! his sorrow! Must I believe this thing? Mich. Nay, heed not, lady. He comes to lay his prize of victory Upon the altar, and there is no voice To say a conqueror nay. Emp. But I will say it. I will not live a day with such a traitor. Good Michael! Well I know thou lov'st me well. Advise me! I am wretched, and my head Abhors this bloodstained crown. Nay, I will fly Before he cometh. Mich. Thou should'st fly with me But that thy delicate faith and troth forbid thee, But bear awhile to know his villainy; Speaking no word, it may be Providence Will pity thee and send thee swift relief. Heaven pity thee, my love! Emp. Nay, sir, remember, Such words dishonour me. Mich. Farewell! Farewell! SCENE II.‚ÄîA Street in Byzantium. Citizens. 1st Citizen. Well, I never thought to feel happy again after that miserable winter with the Bulgarians clamouring at our gates and the whole suburb of St. Mamas' in flames. Do you remember that dreadful night, when the Emperor and his retinue only just escaped from the Conference by riding hard, and just as they gained the Golden Gate and safety, the enemy's horse were upon their rear? 2nd Cit. What were the rights of that matter, Citizen? I suppose those rascally Barbarians thought to catch C√¶sar in one of their detestable ambuscades, and were not quick enough. What a treacherous hateful crew! It is useless to keep faith with such cowards. 1st Cit. Oh, quite out of the question, in fact, false villains. 3rd Cit. No doubt; but are you quite sure of your facts? I know a soldier of the Guard, and he told me, under strict promise of secrecy, that it was the Emperor who set the ambuscade for the Bulgarians; not they for him. 2nd Cit. I don't believe it; that conscientious creature, that mass of principle and scruples, that half priest half soldier, do such a thing, not he! 3rd Cit. Don't believe it, indeed! Why, what is the great harm of ridding yourself of a perfidious enemy by paying him back in his own coin? Not the least, say I, and you have only to succeed to be right. 1st Cit. Well then, the Emperor is in the right now. He did not manage to kill the King of Bulgarian in ambush, but just as he was sitting down before Constantinople he dies, as good fortune would have it, and then the rest was easy. The Emperor made a sally last night; the enemy, already sick, were surprised and routed, and now there is not a Bulgarian within fifty miles, and their country is ravaged, half their army lies buried on the spot under the Mount of Leo, there is a truce for thirty years, and there will be a fine thanksgiving to-day at St. Sophia's. 2nd Cit. Well, all's well that ends well. But I think there must have been something in the soldier's story too‚Äîfor from that time to this, Leo has been desponding, and praying in his private chapel far into the night and before daybreak. Why, the chapel choir have been summoned to sing Kyrie Eleison so often that the first tenor's voice is worn as thin as a reed. 3rd Cit. Well, if it fails the Emperor can replace him. I am told he has the most powerful baritone in all Constantinople, and he has no greater pleasure than singing the chants. 1st Cit. Then, depend upon it, the story is true. He has something to repent of, no doubt, and it cannot be any common-place sin, because he is as sober as an anchorite and a good deal chaster than a hermit. 2nd Cit. But how did he come to consent to the strong measures against the Bulgarians, if your story be true. 3rd Cit. Well, I will tell you. I believe it was the Patrician Michael, the Amorian, who persuaded him for his own purpose. I believe he knows too much, and Leo has to obey him willy-nilly. They have been comrades, remember. What was it led to the defeat and death of John Aplaces? I have no doubt Michael could tell you an he would. Who ennobled him? There is not a greater scoundrel among the Patricians, and that is saying a good deal. 1st Cit. I dare say you are right, Citizen. All the more reason for rejoicing that the Emperor is himself again. Life would not be worth having under Michael the Amorian, and if I were the Emperor I would make him impossible without loss of time. 3rd Cit. Oh fie, Citizen. I am afraid a barbarian might, if he heard you, think our people less scrupulous than, thanks to the saints! they are. 1st Cit. Well, it is certain he never goes to the palace, and the old friend-ship is broken off. He is a dangerous enemy, with no sense of gratitude, and owes Leo a grudge for supplanting him with his old love the Empress. He will begin plotting presently, you will see. Well, sufficient for the day, etc. At last, after so many years, our empire is secure, peace is ensured, and if it were not for the rascally Priests and the equally rascally Iconoclasts, honest men like you and I might have nothing to do but enjoy ourselves and make love to our wives. 3rd Cit. Or to other peoples'? Well, it is about time for the procession to St. Sophia's. I hear the music in the distance. [Exeunt. SCENE III.‚ÄîBefore St. Sophia's. Leo. Surely my soul is shriven of its guilt, Since Heaven smiles on me now, I am again Victorious as of old, ere my great sin A few short months ago blighted my life. Oh, Aplaces, my comrade Aplaces! Would thou wert with us now to bear the crown Which I would gladly yield thee; for indeed It was not power I longed for, but to keep Unstained the faith of Christ. For the deceit Which would have ta'en the foemen in the toils, I know 'twas wicked now, but pitying Heaven, Knowing I sinned for others, not myself, Soiled not my soul with act. I ru'e indeed In plenitude of power, and on the altar I lay my purified and grateful heart An offering, and will swear an oath to rule With justice to each humblest citizen. And knowing war too well will cherish Peace, And keep the simple faith of Christ unstained By gross idolatries. I sit in the seat Of Antonine and Constantine, and strive To make my people happy. But I see not The Empress and my children. Where are they? Servant. Her Majesty is well, But humbly prays you Have her excused, who when the thanksgiving Is done will wait on you. Enter Archbishop, and Priests with Acolytes in procession. Leo. Then must I go Alone, as is my fate. Lead on, my lords, I would give thanks to God. [Procession disappears within the church to chanting music. Empress bursting in. Emp. Will God forgive The hypocrite who lays a bloodstained hand Upon His sacred altar? ACT IV. (An Interval of Seven Years.) SCENE I.‚ÄîA Street in Byzantium. The Patriarch and Priests, Theodore of Studium, and Monks. The Patriarch. Good sirs, how think you? Hath not his Majesty a right to order, If I your Patriarch have not, that the monks Should bear no more the sacred ikons forth Along the streets for worship, and forbid That any in God's House should bow the knee To statue or to picture, or to aught Save only the invisible Spirit that dwells Upon His altar? Theodore. Lord Theodotus, The usage of the Church is stronger far Than any word of man. The Church of Christ Hath in all times since first she built the faith Fired thus her worshippers, by reverence For symbols of the Unseen. Pat. Idolaters Are all who do this thing! Theo. Idolaters! Not them we worship, but the Deity, Formless itself, which fills them. Holy Father, I pray you ask not this obedience. Pat. Son, By C√¶sar's will and by my holy office I do inhibit thee from such rebellion As thou dost meditate. Wilt thou obey And swear allegiance, then thou art forgiven; If thou wilt not, I have the Imperial mandate To banish thee from Rome. Theo. Then will I go. I will hold fast the faith and all it teaches, Whatever doom awaits me. Pat. Guards, arrest him; I have the Emperor's commands. Tonight He sails for Asia. Monks. Nay, nay; he shall not go! Down with the tyrant! [Clamour from Monks; Guards press them back and arrest Theodore. Patriarch and Monks exeunt. 1st Priest. Let him rot in exile, I care not‚Äîgross, idolatrous knave; but think you C√¶sar is true? What think you I have heard? He did entreat our Patriarch to be All things to all. The pictures and the ikons He bids him not expel, but place them high Upon the walls, so that the ignorant Kneel not to them, but Heaven. A fig, say I, For such half-hearted, feeble compromise! If it is wrong to worship them, 'tis wrong To tempt the weakling soul. Oh, for a man With a man's strength, to rule like that brave noble Michael the Amorian, an iconoclast In heart and hand alike! 2nd Pr. Who told you this? 1st Pr. It came from Michael's lips. 2nd Pr. Well, he knows best. But can you trust his word? 1st Pr. Ay, that we can, When it suits his purpose. 2nd Pr. As it does, no doubt, To pull down C√¶sar's pride. Well, breathe no word, But keep the faith, and pray its champion Come to his own in time. [Exeunt. Enter Courtiers. 1st Courtier. A plague, I say, on this Armenian upstart, Who, stammering his bastard Greek, would bring The Empire to disgrace. There is no judge But goes in fear of him and of his cant Of equal justice, threatening honest suitors If they would show them grateful. 2nd Court. Ay, 'tis true We have fallen on evil times; the revenue Which flowed so carelessly of old, he pares With parsimonious meanness‚Äîsuch regard For the complaining villein that it boots not To be his officer. Officer. His faithful army Knows a worse lot. Such pitiless discipline He holds, the saintly bigot, not a soldier, Whatever his rank or age, but seems to pine Under his prying eye. Court. Would he were dead! We want a C√¶sar, as of old, as was The Michael we have lost. Officer. Ay, that we do, And there is one to hand, alike in name, Michael the Amorian; strong in noble manhood, No dreamer of thin dreams, but a strong arm Which can sustain the right. See, here he comes! Welcome, my lord. Have you heard how the people Rise in revolt, how passionate mobs beset The Palace; how the mutinous Guards insult The Sacred Image on the gate, or how The Abbot, Theodore, among his monks Carries the holy pictures down the streets Through kneeling crowds. Mich. Nay, nay, too well I know The shameful tale! Would that our Rome once more Knew a strong ruler as of yore! But why Thus wish in vain? 1st Court. 'Tis not in vain, my lord. You are not alone. Mich. Alone, in what, I pray you? In thought, say you, or deed? 1st Court. Alone in neither. You have many friends. Mich. Ay, that I hope indeed. But how should friendship cure the pressing ills Which do infest the State? Court. My lord, I tell you, And I do speak for all and thousands else Who think with us; if thou should'st speak the word, Rome might be thine to-morrow. Mich. Ah, friends, good friends! Breathe not such thoughts, I pray; the Emperor Has been my life-long comrade; to his bounty I owe my noble rank, and if sometimes I have deplored the errors which have led him To acted crime, yet have I thought them sprung From the head, not from the heart. Yet crimes they are, Unworthy C√¶sar‚Äîtreasons, stratagems, Murders most foul. Court. Nay, my lord, speak more plainly. We did know much, but these‚Äî Mich. Ask not of them. My lips are sealed. Court. Nay, but your duty bids you What friendship would forbid. Mich. Ay, is it so? Then must I speak. Oh Heaven, the Emperor Betrayed to death the stainless Aplaces And thousands with him, that he might ascend His bloodstained throne. When he was seated on it He sought to slay the fierce Bulgarian King In treacherous ambush at the Conference And all his train, and since unmerited Fortune Has given him victory, he seeks to harass All precious things alike; religion, justice, The honour of our armies. It is time To end this tragedy, and if you will, I pledge to you my life. Court. My lord, we all Will stand by you; we will be free once more. Give but the word, and all who hear you now Will die for you at need. Mich. Good friends, I thank you, If it must be, it must. Let it be soon. Approach the soldiers! Raise the Citizens! Spread on all sides what you have learned to-day, And before long, grant Heaven, this tyranny Lies shattered on the ground, and you shall choose Some worthier ruler, not myself, who am Too weak for higher duty than to live The servant of our Rome. Court. Nay, thou alone Canst save us, Michael. Mich. Citizens, I pray you Breathe not a word, but let us meet together In secret, this day se'nnight‚Äîhaving fixed How best to gain success. Now let us go, This concourse may betray us. Court. Noble Michael, We are all thine. [Exeunt. Mich. Fools, knaves, and dullards all! Too easy conquest; tho' it suits my purpose To cozen you, i' faith 'tis weary work. There is not one among you fit to tie The Emperor's latchet. Knaves! when my turn comes I'll deal with you. SCENE II.‚ÄîA Room in the Palace. The Empress and her Lady. Empress. Good Helena, I am weary, yet I know Sleep will not come to me, if I should seek it. These rumours of dark plots, and stratagems Forbid me rest. The Emperor, my husband, Comes not, so heavy lies the load of care Upon the Imperial brow. Helena. Your Majesty, Would you that I should sing to you and lull Your sleepless care to rest? Emp. Nay, Helena, Music speaks comfort to harmonious souls, But not to those racked with discordant cares, As mine is now. But come! I know thy skill. Sing me some sweet, sad song. [Helena sings. ‚ÄúWhat shall bring solace to the heart Whose hope lies dead? What anodyne shall dull life's smart When Faith has fled? Oh Love, relight thy torch and reillume, Divine Magician, the encircling gloom! ‚ÄúForlorn our footsteps stray in vain Thro' darkling night. Desponding, anxious, full of pain, Shine, sacred light! Dispel the glooms of doubt, until the Sun Of Faith mounts high and all our cares are done.‚Äù I thank thee, dear, 'Tis a sweet, sad song. Hel. Nay, wherefore, gracious mistress, Are you thus anxious, since your enemies Are fallen into the toils; the Amorian pines, Loaded with chains, in prison, and with him all The vile conspiring crew. Emp. Oh, Helena! Can I rejoice because these hapless men Are taken, and go forth to die with tortures Because they did conspire? Hel. The Emperor Were else undone and you‚Äîsure it is justice that dooms them. Emp. Nay, good Helena, a throne Gained by unworthy means, treachery, bloodshed, Breeds like offence in others. Hel. Gracious lady! When did the Emperor shed blood of any? That saintly man! Emp. Nay, Helena, forget My hasty words‚ÄîI am unhinged to night And miserable, and know not what I say; This loneliness and brooding thought o'erset My feeble spirit. Hel. I would the Emperor Might come to comfort you. Emp. Nay, nay, indeed I would not, for I shrink from sight of him. Long years we live apart from bed and board; 'Tis long since I have seen him, for there comes A bar between our souls. Hel. My gracious mistress, Surely this is but phantasy; your spouse Is faithful to your bed, husband and father Without a spot of blame. For policy He is the soul of justice, not a subject But knows it well. Emp. Ay! But were this the cloak Of vile hypocrisy? What then? What say'st thou If it were proved that every step he trod To his throne was through deceit; if every jewel In the proud crown he wears was bought with blood And treachery; if now he purchases His safety with the freedom and the lives Of those who would have saved him from the crimes Which, unrepented, damn him? Helena! I cannot doubt this horror. Michael, A pure and noble soul, with much reluctance Discovered all, and since that day I know not Comfort, or sleep, or peace. Hel. Dost know him well? Emp. Ay, for I loved him once, And he‚Äîhe loves me still. Hel. Dared he declare His lawless love? Emp. 'Twas his great passion broke, Despite him, into utterance, and I pitied His loveless life; I whom kind Heaven had blest With love requited, till I forced from him The tale of Leo's guilt. Nay, Helena, His is a stainless soul. Hel. By Heaven, it is not, But a deceiver's and a villain's‚Äîtraitor And murderer at heart! Emp. What proof have you Of these wild whirling words, for without proof I will not hold him false? Hel. Oh, how to free A woman self-enchained! Listen, dear Mistress, There is no other way. I needs must speak, Though the words blight my life. Dear lady, heed not His glozing words. I too have loved this man, And he betrayed me. See, he is a villain! There is no lie too vile for him, no action Too treacherous, no stain of blood so deep But he would soil his soul with it to gain The pettiest end. Emp. Nay, Helena, I loved him, 'Tis long ago, yet cannot hear such things Even now unmoved. Hel. Hast thou not spoken of it To the Emperor? Emp. Nay, I could not. Hel. Ah, dear lady, Love mates not with unfaith. Oh, tell him all. I hear without the trumpets which announce His coming. Tell him all that Michael told thee, And trust thy love again. [Exit. Enter Leo. Leo. Wife, is it well with thee? 'Tis long, meseems, Since thou and I have been as we were once, One heart, one soul, some secret chilling doubt Comes 'twixt our lives, not mine, for I am still Thy lover as of old; but thou hast ta'en Some deep distrust, 'twould seem. What is't, my heart? Emp. Nay, nay, my lord, nothing but what thyself Knows best. Leo. Nay, that indeed I do not. Tell me. Thou art not jealous? Emp. Nay, indeed, my lord, My grief is more than that; of that unfaith I never did suspect thee. Leo. Ay, I thought not. What is it, then? Let us not live asunder. It may be in a time of treacheries, And plots, and murders,‚Äîit may be our fate To die together. Emp. Treacheries! murders! say you Thus glibly off the tongue? Hast thou no fear To use them? Leo. Nay, that have I not, nor fear To punish them when found. Emp. Even in thyself? Deep hidden within thy soul? Leo. Not in myself! I mete no other measure to myself Than that I give to others. Emp. Oh! my husband, Be not deceiv√®d thus! Leo. Nay, wife, what is it? Emp. Is thy soul free from stain for Aplaces? Leo. Alas, 'tis not indeed, my days, my nights Are full of him, and every trivial hour Has threescore tongues which whisper, ‚ÄúAplaces,‚Äù Nought else, and shall till death. Emp. Then art thou guilty! It was as they have told me, and 'tis true Thou did'st betray thy comrade‚Äîthat thyself Might grasp the crown. Leo. Nay, nay, I did it fearing He should betray the faith of Christ, no more. Heaven be my witness. Emp. But thou did'st betray him, And Rome with him? Leo. Nay, nay! Not willingly. I strove to give my life for him, but found It was too late, our Roman legions routed, And my dear comrade slain, and for a lie Forged by a villain. Emp. Dear, I do rejoice That 'twas not as I feared. But that sad plot Against the hostile King? Leo. Heaven has forgiven The sin I did not. The same serpent-voice That tempted to betray my comrade, urging That I should keep the Faith unblemished, bade me For thee and for our children's honour, freedom, Nay, life itself, accept the crafty scheme Which, I praise Heaven, failed. Emp. For me and mine! Was it for us thou sinned'st! My love! My life! My martyr once again! My paragon! Stainless no longer, but more lovable Even for thy fault‚Äîforgive me that I doubted Thy precious truth. Before thee I would kneel As to my lord. Leo. Nay, wife, thou art forgiven. 'Tis a sad world. But who was it betrayed My fault to thee? Emp. Thy friend, whom once I loved, Michael the Amorian. Leo. God! how base is man! 'Twas he who did persuade me to offend By subtle argument, which, reinforced By my great love, misled me. Emp. The base wretch! That I should once have loved so black a soul! He should be punished. Leo. Nay, his punishment Should rest with Heaven, but now his treacheries And murderous intrigues, being discovered, He lies in prison, and to-day the judges Have sentenced him to die. Poor wretch, I would That I might spare his life and banish him, For we were boys together. Emp. Good, my lord, What is his sentence? Leo. 'Tis to die to-morrow In boiling oil. 'Tis the law speaks, remember, Not I. Emp. And is't to-morrow? Dost thou mind What day it is? The birthday of our Lord. The brightest day in the revolving year, Vowed to high revelry and innocent mirth, Because the world is saved. Leo. Ay, so it is. But the law dooms him, and I dare not set My will above it. Emp. Leo, thou art C√¶sar. Thy will is law. I pray you think a moment What thing thou dost. If thy great clemency Pardon him not; yet, oh, I prithee, stain not This holy day with blood. Leo. Thou dost not know, As I, how grave his plot, how great a danger, I speak not of ourselves, but for the State, Comes from delay. Nay, nay, I dare not do it. Let the law take its course. Emp. Leo, I pray you Listen to me this once. To-morrow's dawn Will see thee in the church, bearing your part In chanted hymns,‚Äîto-morrow thou wilt take The solemn Eucharist, while in his cell The comrade of thy boyhood writhes in torture And his cries shock thy ears. 'Twere mortal sin To do this thing! Leo. Good wife, thou can'st not know The peril, but because thou takest care For my soul's welfare only‚Äîlet it be Even as thou wilt. I will bid the officer Bring to me ere I sleep the master-key Of Michael's fetters. For thy tender heart, I pray it bring not swift calamity On thee, and on our children. [Exeunt. SCENE III.‚ÄîMichael's Dungeon. Michael in chains, and Gaoler; afterwards Leo. Mich. Good sir, I pray you pity me, and ease These galling chains a little. It is late, And I shall die with morning. Of your kindness‚Äî And I have much to thank you for‚ÄîI pray you Let me rest now. It is the last request That I shall make on earth. Gao. My lord, my duty Compels me that I guard thee, but indeed I grieve to see thee here in this sad cell Which opens on the grave. Mich. They call me traitor. But I was never traitor to my country, Nor sold her, as did some. Gao. Nay, that, my lord, I am sure thou didst not. Noble Aplaces Was long my leader, and who was it sold him And all his men to death? Not thou, I know. Mich. Sir, thou art right indeed. I loved my comrade With more than woman's love. The power that pens me Within this dungeon's walls, did to his death Drive on that precious life. Who is the traitor? Nay, nay, not I, but Leo. Gao. My good lord, I pity your sad case‚Äîand here are many Who do espouse your fortunes. Mich. Give to them An innocent man's blessing. If your pity Is real, as I think it, let me pass The few hours left me in unfettered rest. Gao. Nay, that I cannot, for the Emperor Carries with him the keys; but on my bed, Softer than is your own, I pray you stretch Your weary limbs, until the signal comes Which bids you wake to die. Good night, my lord, Sleep well till, waking, you shall bid good morning In the new dawn of heaven. Mich. Canst thou condemn An innocent man? My friends, without the walls, Are planning my release. Thou wilt have gold And rank if they succeed. Gao. My lord, I dare not; I care not for my life, but dread to leave My children fatherless. Pray you take rest It may be Heaven will touch the tyrant's heart With clemency. Mich. Sir, it is wasting time To trifle with you. Let me sleep, I pray you. I am dead tired. [Throws himself on Gaoler's bed and falls asleep. Enter Leo. Leo. I cannot sleep. My heart is sore, I dread The morning. 'Tis the mystic eve when all The kine, they say, kneel in their stalls, and sounds Of angel-music fill the starry pole. To-night of all nights in the year shall I Sleep while my comrade spends the waning hours That lie 'twixt him and death? What can I do To spare his life? Gaoler, how fares your prisoner? What! Sleeping on your bed? Hadst thou not charge That he within the straitest cell of doom Should wait the morning? Gao. Good, my lord, forgive me If I have erred in this, for I will answer With my own life for his. Leo. Withdraw awhile, Leave us alone. [Exit Gaoler. Leo (regarding Michael asleep). He sleeps the dreamless sleep Of an untroubled soul. Great God! how strange Thy judgments show‚Äîfor know I not Thy Word, ‚ÄúFor so He giveth His beloved sleep.‚Äù Dost Thou then love the traitor, who for self Would tread the paths of bloodshed and betray Love, friend, or country? Is not innocence Dearer than guilt to the All-seeing Eye Too pure to look on foulness? Does Thy mercy Open so wide a door, that to the cry Of the repentant heart Thou dost unseal The treasures of Thy grace? And if Thy hand Is pitiful, shall I, who am a wretch, Needing Thy pardon sorely for ill-deeds Acted or thought, forgivenot? Michael! Michael! Guilty thou art indeed, but it may be Thou hast found peace. Here is the master-key Of all thy gyves‚Äîwhat should the Emperor Unlock them now, so that thou wake with dawn To freedom, and a word, a sign might open Thy prison doors for thee? Nay, nay, I may not! Would not this plotter, who it seems has gained That simple gaoler to him, and his friends The idolatrous crew, the vile, corrupt oppressors, The needy courtiers and the dregs of the city Flood Rome with blood? Nay, though he shall not die, To-morrow, I will send him, guarded well, To exile. [Chanting of carols heard without. Ah, the sacred music passes. 'Tis Christmas morn, once more. I am rejoiced To hear them once again. I cannot mar This sacred day with blood; peril there is, Great peril, in delay; but I will spend (It may be that I have not long to live) One happy day at least. With early dawn I must to the chapel with the choir and sing My hymns of praise to Heaven. Enter Gaoler. Gaoler, keep safe Your prisoner. It is Christmas-day. God keep you. He came to-day to save. [Exit Leo. Gao. Ah, who would think A tyrant could thus speak! [Michael wakes. Mich. What a strange dream! I dreamt the Emperor looked on me as I slept. Gao. Nay, my lord, truly It was not dream. Mich. What! did he come and see me At rest upon your bed? Gao. Ay, that he did. Mich. Seemed he surprised? Gao. He gave me charge to keep My prisoner safe‚Äîno more, and then I heard him Say in low tones, these words, ‚ÄúPeril there is, Great peril, in delay.‚Äù Mich. Said he no more? Gao. Ay, this, ‚ÄúWith early dawn I must to the chapel with the choir.‚Äù Then went Stealthily as he came. Mich. Then am I nigh Death's gate as ever luckless mortal was, Who yet did breathe and live. I do beseech you Succour a dying man. Fetch a confessor. I cannot die unshriven. Gao. My lord, I go to send him. [Exit Gaoler. Mich. Quick! Now with these fettered hands To write to Theodore and the vile crew Who did conspire with me. ‚ÄúMichael, the Amorian, Dies with the dawn. Therefore lose not a moment. The Emperor in the chapel with the day Singeth the Christmas chants. Take trusty men, Disguised as choristers, and beneath their robes Let them bear arms. If any doubt their man, Let them await until his pealing voice Mounts loftier than the rest. Then let the singer Fall 'neath sure strokes. Remember, if you do not, Michael, at daybreak, purchases his freedom With all your heads!‚Äù Enter Priest. Priest. My poor unhappy son, Wouldst make confession? Mich. Welcome, holy father, I would make my peace with God and with the Church, Whose loving son I am. I have borne no part With those idolatrous dogs, whose vile devices Defile the sanctuary, and therefore only It is I come to die. Priest. My son, the Church Is grateful for thy service, and would give thee, Through my poor hands, her blessing. Therefore, kneel And make confession first. Mich. That will I, father. Yet pardon me if I should dare to make One last request. There are whom once I fear I did offend‚Äîthe Abbot Theodore And other worthy souls. I fain would die At peace with all the world. Would'st thou, good father, For I am prisoned, bear the message to them Which here is written, and to the holy man Give it in his own hands? Priest. My son, I will. Mich. I thank thee, father, and will count the minutes Until thou comest to shrive me. [Exit Priest. Nay, my hour Is not yet come. I shall not die, but live To wear the Imperial Crown! ACT V. SCENE I.‚ÄîThe Ante-chapel of the Imperial Chapel. Citizens. Distant thunder and lightning. 1st Cit. A Merry Christmas to you, friends. A Merry Christmas. But I do wish that 'twas a fairer morning. It does freeze beyond doubt‚Äîas my fingers tell me, and strange to say at this season there is a great storm coming. Do you hear the thunder? 2nd Cit. If I were not a good son of the Church, nothing would have made me turn out at this hour, and this a holiday, too, when one might have lain warm for hours. But 'tis Christmas-day, and the Emperor is sure to be here presently, and there will be largess when he comes forth, no doubt. 3rd Cit. Well, perhaps it is just as well that it is so cold and dark, else there would have been more of us to share it. 1st Cit. Ay, and there will be some fine music, I promise you. The Emperor himself will sing in the choir. He has a wonderful deep voice, and is as devout as a Priest. 2nd Cit. A good deal more so, Citizen‚Äîbelieve me! But here are more, ready robed for the choir, and muffled up to the eyes. 3rd Cit. Ay; don't you see; they are no doubt those great singers whom Leo has paid handsomely, as he did last year. Well, it is easy to be devout if you have unbounded wealth to draw upon as he has. 1st Cit. They say he has made great preparations this year to have the Christmas service sung more splendidly than ever, because he has been now seven years Emperor, and thinks every year may be his last. 2nd Cit. Well, so it may be, very likely. Some one is sure to want his throne soon. We don't keep our C√¶sars too long as a rule. 3rd Cit. Well, it won't be Michael the Amorian, in any case. That excellent Patrician is in the cells safe enough. 1st Cit. Yes, and will be served up with oil presently. I must go and see that function when the Mass is done. Well, let us go outside and walk about to keep warm. It cannot be colder than it is here. Enter two Conspirators disguised as Choristers. 1st Cons. We are in time‚Äîthey have not arrived yet. We had better pass in at once. Remember, if 'tis too dark to distinguish faces, we may know him, as Lord Michael wrote, easily. We must wait for a fine deep voice‚Äî chanting alone. 2nd Cons. And then? 1st Cons. Then stab him to the heart! 2nd Cons. Agreed! But there must be no hesitation, or half and half work, or our lives and our employers' are not worth an hour's purchase. 1st Cons. I am ready if thou art. Pass on. Where is the holy water? I must make the sign of the cross for luck before I go in! [Exeunt into Chapel. Enter Leo. Leo. The Priests are not yet come, but the hours creep Too slow for sleepless eyes. Here once again, It may be for the last time, I am spared To keep this solemn Christmas. I thank God My hands are free from bloodshed and my soul, For musing, since I left him, on our lives And how we grew together, till some spell Bewitched his honour, I have ta'en resolve To pardon him, who one time was my friend. And therefore 'tis that, with a grateful heart Tuned to high praise, I come this Christmas morn To let my joy and thankfulness to Heaven Rise like a surging fountain. When the Mass Is done, then will I to his cell, and there Unlock his fetters, and will bid him go And plot no more, but turn him to the right, Remembering who was born to-day and came Upon the earth to save. Enter Patriarch and Bishops‚Äî Priests and Choir in procession. Lord Patriarch, I give you a good Christmas. I am ready, My heart is full of praise. [Exit into Chapel. [Procession passes into Choir. Chanting begins. Conspirators concealed behind pillar, listen cagerly. Kyrie Eleison. At length Leo sings alone. When he has finished, they rush forward and attempt to stab him. Confusion. Leo defends himself with cross, snatched up. Struggle. Leo. Villains, would you pollute The sanctuary with blood? See, with the Cross I do confront you. Have you no mercy, wretches? 1st Cons. Nay, 'tis no time for mercy, but for vengeance. Tyrant, take that! [Stabs him. Leo. Oh, I am sped! I am sped! How wonderful Thy judgments are, my God! [Leo falls. Conspirators fly. Enter Empress, Helena veiled, and Children, who throw themselves on their father's breast. Empress. My love, what ails thee? Some presentiment Of evil brought me. Leo. Kiss me, ere I die. I have loved thee long and always. For my sins, I think they are forgiven. Spare their lives Who slew me, they are guilty, but they were Vile instruments at worst. Set Michael free! Let him not die! [Dies. Enter Michael in chains. Michael. Michael will free himself! What! Is he dead? Quick! Take from him the key Which locks these gyves. [Unlocking chains, which fall with a clang. See! I am prisoner No longer, but your Emperor. Remove That dead man's body and give it burial Befitting C√¶sar dead. See you, that woman Goes with her brood to exile! Emp. Thou vile wretch! Thou murderer of the noblest life that flowered From a decaying realm. Listen! I loathe you, I do defy your malice. I, your Sovereign, Despise you. I, whose senseless woman's tongue Snatched you from merited doom, I do denounce you Traitor and perjurer! Mich. Away with them! Their weakness doth protect them. (To Patriarch.) You, my lord, Be sure I will maintain your holy Church And this our State. [A loud clap of thunder and blinding flash of lightning. Confusion. Nay, nay, I am unscathed. Heaven doth approve the strong nor lightly strikes Your Emperor. To-morrow you shall crown me In St. Sophia's. Re-enter Helena, bursting from her Guards, with Citizens. Citizens. Long live our new C√¶sar, Michael the Amorian! Helena. Nay, not long, poor dupes, Nor ever C√¶sar, but a villain doomed By Heaven's own voice. Listen, thou hypocrite And murderer! The woman thou didst wrong Long since and hast forgotten (unveils), though she spared Her base betrayer long, yet will not spare The murderer of her lord, who banishes Her mistress and their orphans. Dost thou think Thy legions, or thy Priests can save thee now? Nay, nay, they shall not, nor the powers of hell. Thy day is done, Traitor and Murderer! Take that, and that, and that! [Stabs him. [Michael falls dead by the side of Leo. Patriarch. Just and unjust! Behold the hand of Heaven! To-morrow we will lay them side by side In St. Sophia's. Curtain. A LAST VISION. Oh, wonder! oh, transport! Oh, ecstasy! that fills the purg√®d sight With beams of golden light. And is this then the old familiar Earth, Or a new sphere gained by a second birth? As waking from my cloistered slumbers deep, I spurn the caves of sleep. Oh, wonder surpassing! A hundred suns for one, with constant light, A wake the ethereal air and banish Night; Sleep shrinks abashed, and Sleep's half-sister Death, Nor Time disturbs, nor Age, nor failing breath, While high ineffable rhythms roll around Harmonious waves of sound. Oh, glory! oh, rapture! For lo! the troubles and the toils are past, Done are the chequered years of Earth at last, The wandering footsteps on the unlighted way; Here the new Dawn ushers unfailing Day. Oh, calm effulgence from a cloudless sky! Spirit! is this to die? Oh, marvel! oh, glory! For see once more the lost are here again, Unchanged in aught, yet purged of earthly stain; And lo! the saints, the sages, a white throng Chanting with accents clear the Eternal song, Martyrs of Truth who braved in every age The World's despite and rage. Oh, vision enchanting! Here there is work for all! dutiful, blest, Sweeter and higher far than idle rest, Work that exalts the man above the brute; Laborious days that never fail of fruit; Forces that faint not; brains that never tire; Souls that aspire! aspire! Oh, wonder amazing! Lo! 'tis the self-same world, tho' seeming strange, By some ineffable change, And such transforming radiance grown divine As never on the sad old Earth might shine. And hark, the long-hushed tones of homely love, And lo! the clear calm eyes which looked above. Yea, here or leagues beyond the farthest sun Nor life nor love are done! POEMS UNCOLLECTED OR RESTORED. IN DECEMBER. Upon the dying year's profoundest night, Dead gloom, and frozen air, Shines age by age a little speck of light To make its darkness fair. Lo! on midwinter breaks the vernal sun, A miracle is done! Long ages since, on the Jud√¶an hill The nightly watchers heard Angelic choirs the starlit heavens fill With that consoling word; And the three Kings were guided on their way To where the young Child lay. Nor only once and for our strenuous West Night's curtain was withdrawn; On the dim East by some divine behest There broke an earlier dawn. The Pilgrim mild, to saintly pureness grown, Made the young World His own. And later yet the soldier-Prophet came, Hurling the false gods down; The obedient millions mark His stern eyes flame, His fierce compelling frown, Idols obscene and blood-stained temples burn, And to the Invisible turn! The cold ascetic Prince, the royal Saint, Was pitiful and sweet, Yet was His voice too low, His light too faint, To guide men's wandering feet; The Caliph swayed their souls by fire and sword More than persuasive Word. And tho', the unity of God, He knew With clear undoubting eyes, For grosser souls His politic fancy drew A sensual Paradise. Not this our dream who in the mire would cast Our low, unlovely Past. For we a sorrowful Master serve and meek, A Ruler white and pure; Strong with the Heaven-sent strength which arms the weak, Still shall His reign endure. Good-will and Peace for men He preaches still, Good-will and Peace‚ÄîGood-will! And though men's careless ears are slow to hear, Though Peace delay her reign, Despite the victories of Wrong and Fear, The secular cries of Pain, Still shall our souls, content beneath His sway, A wait the fuller Day. Broaden, fair Light, with this blest day dawn born, To noon, to perfect Day; Still for our toiling race 'tis early morn, Light thou the difficult way. Tho' other suns have set, rise high! shine bright! Till falls Creation's Night! IN PRAISE OF TOWY. A Poetical Response. Written last autumn (1906) for a garden party at an old mansion in the Vale. All replies were to be in verse. Yes, I will gladly come to spend The golden hours, with many a friend Of the old courteous race and kind, By long ancestral ease refined; From granges decked by gracious art To feast the eye and touch the heart; From velvet lawns and rose-hung bowers, Grey, mouldering, ivy-mantled towers, And calm September's pensive flowers; Halls nestling 'mid the grateful shade By quaint-clipped verdant alleys made; With fairer, statelier than these, The twilight of umbrageous trees, And glancing thro' the branches green, The silvery river-reaches seen. Fair Towy! through thy lingering fall, Since piercing first thy mountain wall, Safe-guarding with thy new-born wave The outlaw's legendary cave; Then by the lone tarn where of old The Fairy plied her oars of gold, And far beneath, the scarp√´d steep Dreaming Llandovery lies asleep, Where the loved Vicar, far and wide, Lit his clear lamp our feet to guide. Still through all change of Time and Creed A very present help indeed; By emerald mead and sylvan hill For ever winding, winding, still, Where Carreg-Cennen's eagle height And frowning towers dashed down the fight, And many a long-descended home Of storied lineage, thou dost come. Hard by, tall Dynevor's castled wood Towers high, reflected in thy flood; And Golden Grove, within whose shade His home the saintly exile made, And, far from noise of civil strife, Taught, as he lived, the Holy Life; And Aberglasney, grey as these, Embosomed in ancestral trees, A home of still monastic peace Watching the tranquil years increase, On Grongar's side; where loud and long The gay thrush echoes Dyer's song; While Nelson's tower, deserted, stands, Crowning its builder's long-lost lands. And ragged Drysllwyn's shot-pierced wall Can old forgotten strifes recall, To where in age-long silence deep Enchanted Merlin lies asleep, Till strikes his hour, and far below The palace-roofs where long ago Laud for his master schemed in vain, Rose high to power, then fell in pain; And Thirlwall's muse, serene and cold, The heroic tale of Hellas told. Past steep Llangunnor's wide-spread yews Where Steele, world-weary, loved to muse, Watching the blue hills kiss the sky Far in the East, as oft have I; Thence gradually broadening down 'Neath gray Caermarthen's high-set town, Of frequent church-tower, statued square, And ivied bastions everywhere, Long arches bridging deeps profound And hurrying shallows brisk with sound; Where in frail skiff the fisher yet With new-mailed silver loads his net, To where before my loving sight, Now blue, now bathed in golden light, By Penbryn's walls, thy waters make The semblance of a glittering lake, And on the spume-flecked rushing tide The white sails upward slowly glide; Anon by fiery Picton's home Wide-spread thy briny waters come, Till past Llanstephan's a√´ry towers, With gradual paces slow as ours By thundering shoal and wreck-strewn bar, Where the calm beacon beams afar; Weary thou sinkest, as shall we, In the unfathomed shoreless sea! What fairer scene, above, below, Hast thou, loved motherland, to show; Than thine, dear vale; or thee, dear stream, The exiled soldiers nightly dream, By the Indian or the Libyan shore, Thee, whom his eyes shall see no more? Yes, I will come, kind Chatelaine, And view thy flower-lit home again; Drink in the limpid Tuscan tongue By Milton loved, by Petrarch sung; Admire again the comeliness Of girlish forms in Vestal dress; And hearken to the innocent mirth Of the young heirs of Time and Earth. Shall we not love our land as they Who held it once?‚Äîwe who to-day, Though swift the lengthening shadows fall A little while are lords of all, A little while? Nay, nay, enjoy! The world is made for girl and boy. Spring-tide and summer-tide are fair, Deep woods, clear streams, caressing air, And tranquil autumn still is dear To failing footsteps, lingering here. Rejoice! Tho' ours the setting sun, For these the day is scarce begun; Trip gaily, maids, on lightsome feet, Life's music calls, and youth is sweet! Oh, sylvan heights, oh, winding stream, In childhood as in age my dream! Valleys there may be still more bright In summer climes with golden light, Heights grander, landscapes fairer yet In some still lovelier framework set, But be it mine, when to their end At length my failing paces tend, To rest beneath the yew's calm shade, Where with my own my bed is made, There many an Easter morning still May loving footsteps climb the hill With fresh-wreathed flowers, where with the Past, My life's long journey, closed at last, Asleep, I wait the summons come Which pealing calls Creation home. FOR PITY'S SAKE From the Queen's Carol, Christmas, 1905. Cold and darkness and rain, Pale children who cry for bread; Famished workers pleading in vain For the labour by which they are fed; Homes dismantled by sure degrees, And the hungry wolf watching the door, Dumb suffering, hopelessness,‚Äîthese Vex our poor brethren, evermore. Shall we sit wrapt in warmth and in ease, Unregarding their pitiful cry, While the strong workers shiver and freeze, And the weak and the aged die? In this time of good tidings for all, Shall we turn from their patient pain, Nor stoop down to the myriads who fall, To lift them to hope once again? What though if for some it may be, 'Tis not all without blame that they sink, In deep waters of misery Drowned, hopeless through sloth or through drink; But the innocent children who bear The default of their fathers, shall they Plead in vain with low wails of despair While we turn unregarding away? Nay, nay; open kind hands, yet combine Wise forethought and pitying heart, Fulfilling the Purpose Divine Which they ne'er may accomplish apart; Taking heed lest the alms which you give Sap the manhood which fathers our race, And the gold which should aid them to live Sink our brothers in deeper disgrace! Not arraigning the Laws or the State With outcries anarchical, loud, Nor the merciless pride of the Great, Comes our peaceful, long-suffering crowd. Oh, Rulers and Statesmen! devise Of your wisdom some politic plan, Some measure, beneficent, wise, Which shall raise, and not lower, the Man! O'er the sad East, in country and town, Their brothers are martyred to-day, By the hoof of the Cossack trod down, By wild dreams of revolt led astray. Though they gain not their mirage of Good, Though they own not a heavenly friend, Though hope's fire seem extinguished in blood, They fight undismayed to the end. And the groan of their suffering mounts high To the careless, unpitying stars, Far and wide 'neath the face of the sky Rage rebellions and murderous wars; Oh, poor brothers, at last may you gain, At last, after blood, after fire, Relief from oppression and pain, And the peace of your yearning desire! But here in our England serene, Secure on her ocean-based throne, Our Una, our Faerie Queen, Gives ear to her people who moan. Oh, ye nobles of high degree! Oh, ye burdened with lightly won gold! Pity, pity the misery Of humble homes famished and cold! Give the aid through the pure might of love Which your pride would deny them through fear; Let new stirrings of sympathy move Keen eyes, never wet with a tear. Think of sad mothers fainting with care For their young children's misery, And strong fathers who starve, and yet bear Uncomplaining, because they are free! DREAMERS. ‚ÄúOh for the days that are past!‚Äù The old man despairingly cries. ‚ÄúThe swift years galloping fast; Youth's blossom that springs up and dies.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh that some mighty hand might bring again The blithe young Past, ere life grew dull and vain!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh for the days that shall be!‚Äù Cries the eager voice of the boy; ‚ÄúWhen the world shall be waiting for me, With no duty except to enjoy.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh that some power might speed Time's feet, and bring The Golden Year, bright with unfading Spring!‚Äù Blind longing and senseless regret That contemn the fair Present, and yearn For the Future, deep hidden as yet, And the Past, that shall never return! Work for to-day, nought else; thy work is here, Not far away in some unreal sphere! Here and now is thy drama of life, Here and now is thy labouring day, With its triumphs and failures and strife, But deep rest at the end of the way. Fling the dead Past behind thee, it is done; The Future lurks beyond the unrisen Sun! ODE. On laying the Foundation Stone of the Sanatorium for West Wales, April 28, 1905. Rejoice, be glad! At last The hopeless gloom of premature decay Which saddened our long past, Knowledge has chased away. Beneficent Science, here descending, brings‚Äî A dove on snowy wings‚Äî Hope for despair, and for that life-long pain New strength and health again! To-day, to mark the triumph that has been, The daughter of our unforgotten Queen; The Sister of our King, whose kindly heart In all his people's joys and griefs bears part; Not ignorant of loss, but tenderer grown For all her heart has known; With courtly pomp and white-plumed pageant long, With her own daughter fair, Welcomed by bursts of ancient Cymric Song; To this wild hillside's healing temperate air Comes a thrice-honoured guest; Around her range our long descended great, Our native chivalry, Sprung from our Royal Tribes, when Wales was free, The Magnates of our West From mouldering feudal tower and knightly home Fired by deep pity, come; The thrifty Yeomen, who to-day replace The old freehanded ruling race, Are here, and those good ministering hands Vowed to compassion by their Lord's commands, And those kind pitiful souls, whose healing skill Shrank baffled by the immedicable ill, The dread ‚Äúwhite plague,‚Äù which saps young life away Ere it can burst in flower‚Äîall these to-day Give aid, expending time and toil and wealth To guard the people's health, Content if haply tho' with failing eyes They see the routed powers of evil fled, And precious guerdon of their sacrifice Health and new hope instead. Two equal forces are there, heart and mind, Helpless alone, of giant strength combined; Here both shall work to mutual service bound: Rejoice, give thanks, till all the echoing hills resound. Nature, unpitying, stalks on deaf and blind, Careless upon her course, nor taketh heed For aught, beside the imperious Voice of Mind, Nor halts for suppliant hands, nor hearts that bleed, Yet not long now shall wives and mothers hear, Sick with a boding fear, The tearing, racking sounds, the struggling breath, The harbingers of death; Nor dread the too bright eye, the hectic bloom That heralds early doom; Or later, the pale cheek, the wasted limb, The glittering eye grown dim; But health recovered, in untainted air, Shall smooth the brow of care. Be of good cheer! 'Tis knowledge strong to aid That comes to succour us. Be not afraid! Here, mid close belts of healing odorous pine, For shelter from keen winds and driving rain, Drinking soft airs, the sufferers shall regain New strength, new powers, to stay life's swift decline, Heaven's pure breath, breathing round them day and night, Shall arm them for the fight, Revive again the feeble forces dim, And calm the fluttering heart, and nerve the faltering limb. But when the flying months have eased their pain, Must they return again To the old stifling dens, at last to sink For very wretchedness, in lust and drink? Wise lawgivers! not pitying ruth alone Can hush the sufferer's moan; But knowledge, adding to the toiler's lot Pure food, fit dwellings, unpolluted air, The blessings that are not! How shall the weary toiler come To the diviner thirst for nobler things For whom the long day's labour, ending, brings No sanctities of home? Must those we save again, Changing the ordered fare, the wise control, The decent life for crowded cabins foul Or the mine's choking dust; from heat to cold Shiver thro' wintry daybreaks, as of old, Making our striving vain, And sicken again, in body alike and soul? Ah! there are evils worse than death and pain! Aid us to know Thy Will, Eternal Cause, And love Thy changeless laws; Aid us to know them as they are indeed, Holding the faithful creed That to obey Thee is to gain to know All else above, below. This humble house of healing which we raise, Rock-based with mercy for its cornerstone, Even as those minster spires of ancient days, We dedicate to Thy praise; Mercy Thou lovest more than Sacrifice. May not cold winds, or our oft-clouded skies, Mar this our hopeful work! but do Thou cheer, Blest Presence, Mighty Healer, always near, Our labouring hearts and hands, and Oh! come Life or Death, Quicken us with Thy Breath! HAPPY EVENINGS. From the Book of the Society, December, 1906. The charms of high summer are fading, The swallow flies south with the sun, The song of the lark is long silent, And the blossoms are well-nigh done. Again on our dim murky London And many a labour-stained town, The sad mists brood for the winter, And the cold rains pour pitiless down. Soaked fields, withered grasses, replacing The world which in June was a-bloom, And the dark courts, scarce lighted in summer, Are buried at noon-tide in gloom. What befalls in the dull winter evenings, Young lives pent in a comfortless home, Fireless hearths, overcrowded, ill-lighted, What choice but to aimlessly roam; 'Mid the desolate streets half deserted, And the ills that of darkness are bred; Vicious lives, vile surroundings, foul language, It were better than this they were dead! All day long, even tho' hunger distract them (Soon to cease) 'mid the warmth of the school, 'Tis an orderly life that is taught them, Lit by knowledge and equable rule. But when the tired learners troop homeward With the work, and the prayers at an end, What for them do their poor homes offer? What trace of their Heavenly Friend? Coarse words, drunken brawls, savage anger, Pining lives dragged by poverty down. Were it better than these to escape them 'Mid the deadlier snares of the town? Nay, nay, better than that 'twere to suffer, Yet this through the ages is sure‚Äî Youth and childhood are made for enjoyment So only the pleasures be pure. Heaven-ordained as the burden of labour Is the good gift of innocent play, Which lightens the lot of the learners, And drives their small sorrows away. Dear young lives, there are those to befriend you, High in honour, yet lowly and mild, Who hold riches and rank of less value Than the innocent soul of a child. In high halls, whence unceasing through daylight The hum of the learner ascends, Pleasure rules unabashed through gay evenings With the teacher for comrade and friend. Here deft fingers are busy rehearsing The motherly tasks that shall be, Ears drink in with breathless engrossment The wonders of land and of sea. Here still silence, there boisterous riot, For limbs crampt by motionless hours, As the lithe boyish bodies enfranchised, Race or climb in the pride of new powers. Here sweet music, there eager attention, As some gay little drama is played; There, the strong boyish arms in mock combat, Since Britons are never afraid. Fair blows, without malice or anger, Not the Hooligans' cowardly knife, But fair fight and the manly endeavour Which wins, in the battle of life. Happy work, by pure pity suggested, Wise effort and delicate hand, Heart and Brain knit together, remembering The Great Teacher's blessed command. ‚ÄúForbid them not, bring Me the children.‚Äù Keep their lives from the world's cruel stain On whom gathering shadows descending, Make ye dread lest ye labour in vain. Make them gentle in thought, word, and action, Till with lives full expanded they come To a modesty which can o'ermaster The squalors and vices of home. Good friends all, a sufficient requital For your labour and better than fame, Were one lad snatched from a prison! Or one girl from the streets and from shame! WOMAN'S WORK. To Woman the Creator's hand has given To soothe the poor limbs racked with misery, And with a blessed ministry of Heaven Bid life's renascent force again to be. Who but has known her pitying Presence stand Unwearying by childhood's restless bed And with soft voice assuage, and tender hand, The fevered pulses and the aching head. For her the endless mystery of pain, War, pestilence, the long wards choked with wo, The miseries which ruder souls appal, Sound on her ear, a clear, high trumpet-call Of duty, and her soul prepares to go Unfearing forth. Let her not go in vain! Let her not go in vain! For the great Art Of Healing is not brief, but hard and long; And whoso in her eyes would fain grow strong Must woo her with the mind as with the heart. Not less of pitying tenderness has she, The woman armed with learning's triple shield, Who fronts the powers of Pain and Misery, And of her lofty courage scorns to yield, Full armed with knowledge, yet a woman still, A woman in quick thought and pitying eye, A woman with soft hand and accents mild, To soothe the pains of age, the suffering child, Filled with a deep, unfailing sympathy For the poor thralls of Fate's mysterious will. Raise we a Hospice, therefore, which shall give Woman to woman's need. Not the rude force Of man is all, nor thews and sinews coarse, But those fine spiritual blooms which live Within the woman. Not the body alone But the soul, too, she heals. Go forth, brave band, Among the squalid dens, where myriads groan Slaves through their lives, and bid them understand And rise up free; and to the heathen shore Of the old East, where now your sisters pine Pent in the dull Zenana's life-long tomb, Pierce with clear rays the sullen age-long gloom And raise them body and soul, till more and more Shines forth some effluence of the light Divine. SPORT. ‚ÄúForth,‚Äù said the king, ‚Äúwith my legions bold, Trampling squadrons and vigorous men, Blazing with colour, and glittering with gold, Manly limbs strong with the pride of health, Cheeks newly crowned with the blossom of youth. From lowly cottage and towers of wealth, Summon them out without shame or ruth; Set them in line on some hill-side dreary, Torn from their desolate homesteads; and then Let my royal brother who, maybe, is weary Of supple-kneed courtiers, and thirsts for applause; Or troubled by clamours for equal laws, Bring out his tale of dupes and place. The mild-eyed battalions face to face, Fenced with murderous points of steel, And deadly mouths of cannon and rifle, And driven by coarse churls till they learn to stifle The horror of bloodshed which young hearts feel; Then 'mid blare of trumpet and beat of drum, When the shuddering thirst of battle has come, And the earth and the air reel in scarlet alike, Let the signal be given, and let some one strike. And then the game opens, with rolls of thunder, The bolts fly thick, and the blood flows fast: They are pierced, they are torn, they are smitten asunder. And ever, from out of the smoke of fight, Come yells of triumph and groans of pain, And the world shows like hell till the merciful night Hides them, and all is silent again. And when the dawn breaks with its awful gray, Nothing is left of the hard-fought strife But those who will sleep till the last great day, And those who are wrecked and crippled for life; While I and my royal brother meantime, Lazily counting the cost of the day, Strike some vague balance of blood and crime, And settle which of our peoples shall pay.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut these men had no grudge.‚Äù Quoth the king, ‚ÄúYou say well; But the great game of war is as ancient as hell.‚Äù ‚ÄúUp,‚Äù says the sportsman, ‚Äúwith horn and hound, Dashing by forest and field and river, Swept by in tumults of riotous sound, In the maddening hurry and joy of the chase,‚Äî Pulses quickening, and tired eyes flashing, Each striving with each for the pride of place, As by hill and by valley the swift throng goes crashing. And somewhere beyond, in the silent leas, The deadly clamour borne on its ear, As it stays for a moment to tremble and shiver, Is some panting, full-eyed creature, that flees, Stiffening with effort, and faint with fear, Till the poor heart beats faster and faster still, And the limbs move too slow for the desperate will; And then a brief rest and a hopeless pause, And a weak body mangled by ravenous jaws, And the gay hunt sweeps on. Or, on some wild hill, Glowing with heather or brown with fern, Men skulk all day with a murderous skill, Teeth set together, and eyes that burn, Watching and waiting, till, far beneath, An antler moves 'mid the purple heath; Then a long steady aim, and, oh joy! with a bound The deer crashes down like a tree on the ground, Not knowing who smote, or, maybe, half aware, Limps away, bearing death to some fastness, and there Starves to death after long weeks of torture and pain, And finds food for the kites. But we, as we sit Round the fire at our ease, and discuss once again How this wretch was missed, or how that one was hit, Or how the sure dogs tracked another to death, Taste true joys.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut, methinks,‚Äù quoth I, under my breath, ‚Äú'Tis but cowardly work.‚Äù Quoth the sportsman, ‚ÄúAgain You say well; but the chase is as ancient as Cain.‚Äù TOGETHER. Hampstead, Sunday, July 9, 1905. On a midsummer morning, unclouded A poor father loving and mild, Freed at length from the week's dull labour, Went forth with his young girl child. He, a cripple, with paralyzed frame, Maimed by pitiless accident long, Whose weak limbs, distorted and lame, Steel braces supporting, made strong. For both 'twas a long-promised pleasure When the dull, chilly Spring-tide was done, And the thick grass waved in the meadows, Grown tall 'neath the fostering sun. Now 'twas come, and there showed not a shadow On the limitless blue of the sky, And the little maid, kissing her mother, Waved smiling a long good-bye. And now from the dust of the suburb, Through fields and through woodlands they went, Hand in hand, the slow labouring father And the wondering innocent. So they wandered on, taking their fill Of pleasure, with arms full of flowers; Unheeding the fast-fleeting hours, Till 'twas time to descend from the hill. Then sudden the clear heavens round Grew lurid, with sinister light, And a rumble of ominous sound Filled the father with deep affright. Last the great drops splash down as they hurry, Together, half breathless with dread, To seek a low roof's safe shelter, Ere the deluge bursts overhead. And gain it. But ah! it is crowded; So without, 'neath the broad eaves, must stand, The young child and the crippled father, 'Mid the lightnings, hand clasped within hand; Till at last a great flash, with such thunders, As if 'twere the firmament rent, And the hapless pair perish together, Crippled father and innocent. 'Twas the steel round his limbs that drew to him That merciless brand of the sky, And the same stroke that tore them and slew him Bade the fatherless innocent die. With no mark on the fair childish body, Stone-dead! Ah, mysterious command, That slew father and daughter together, Undivided, hand clasped within hand! AN ODE TO FREE ROME. September, 1870. Leap, all ye seven hills; be glad, O hallowed ground, Built up of ruin through the infinite years; Be glad, and let the sound Of joy arise, of joy unmixed with tears, Till all the sacred dust beneath Quicken from out the grasp of death, And Kingdom, Commonwealth, and Empire, each, The will to govern and the brain to teach, Warrior and jurist, and the eloquent tongue, The plastic hand of art, the holy fire of song, Live once again, if ever they were dead: For now the night is past, the dawn is come, The strength of evil spent, the black dream fled, After the age-long gloom the heavens grow red, Man, exiled long, turns to his ancient home: Once more, with longing hearts, the nations yearn; Once more they call, with lips and eyes that burn, Thy name, regenerate Rome! Old art thou, Rome, and worn: So old that scarce our eyes can trace The sum of centuries on thy face: So thick beneath thy soil the empires lie That Heaven's own air above thee seems to die; And on thy plains forlorn By night the plague-mist broods with ghastly breath, And the chill leprous vapours settle down Even to the shrunken limits of the town: Old art thou, and to-day thy Romans dwell Nestling within the broken shell Of palace and of temple, and the hand Of cunning, vanished skill, shines through the wall Of humble hovels tottering to their fall; And oft the delvers 'mid thy ruins start To see some breathing miracle of art; And fair tall columns stand, Amid the sordid present, like the ghost; Showing from out the meanness of to-day, The high hope sunk, the ruin, the decay; Of some once great ideal spent and lost. Thou wert not pure nor good, O Rome, in those great days our hearts recall. On violence thy growing power was built, On violence and guilt; The simpler lives that reared thy Commonwealth The general sober health, Were lived for power, and that through weary time The triumph to the Capitol might climb, With Death in its train; and long before thy fall Thy sated eyes were daily drunk with blood, Thy pitiless hands were busy with scourge and chain A proud cold mistress wert thou, stern and grave, Trampling out life and freedom from thy slave, Till the rude wild barbarians, one by one, Lost the strong pride and vigour of the free, And for their gods took luxury and thee. And ere thy race was run Thy mail√´d legions, speeding fast and far, O'er land and sea had borne the blight of war, Till the world lay asleep, And one foul canker of ignoble peace Consumed thee, slow and deep; And amid dreamy languors of delight, And hot red flushes mixt of lust and blood, Rose-crowned thou satest, thy weary eyes aglow With death-throes of the nude young limbs below; Thy fierce pr√¶torians hurling down The hardly conquered blood-stained crown; Poison and plot, and nameless sloughs of sin. These were the joys thou gavest thy soul to win; These the dead centuries brought, nor seemed as they would cease. And then thou wert divided, and the rude Fierce savage from the boundless plains laid bare Thy fertile fields, and the slow-stealing tide Of ruin, oft beat back, broke high and higher And low and lower; like a dying fire Thy empire sank, till sink it might no more. And after long, long years Of rapine and of tears, Thou, the corrupt, the lewd, Forgetting all thy life that was before, The guilty, gave thy harlot limbs to wear The white robes of the saintly crucified; And with vain sacrifice and heathen rite, And re-established idols, and the steam Of thy discarded censers, thou didst turn, The God-sent words that burn, The pure commands of light, Into a sickly sensual dream; And over all the past Didst such strange glamour cast, That thou, who once wert drunk with blood of saint And martyr‚Äîthou, who once didst flout and scorn The grand old kingdoms not of thee, Didst stoop to bend a lowly knee To a poor fisher, Hebrew born. Him by a cunning fable didst thou take For priest and ruler: and, with craft to make All things thy own, once more thou didst regain Thy old bad rule; and threats of endless pain And promised Heaven; bound with fierce constraint Thy savage conquerors, till thou cam'st to be The mistress of the world, the foe of all the free. And then, O Rome, Began thy worst abasement; for till now Thy vices were the vices of the strong,‚Äî Thy life as theirs in whose full veins the tide Runs over-strong, and the hot turbid pride Of life and youth's swift fires so fiercely glow, That scarce amid the tumult and the throng They hear the sweet old voices come, Telling of innocence and home. For always 'mid the turmoil and the din Of passion and the long laborious sin Pure voices rose: sweet bursts of song Sage words of wisdom, histories fair, Immortal codes of laws, which still Downward the grateful centuries bear, Rhetoric which shall scarcely die, Philosophies remote and high, And breathing art; and through the long Ages, one firm unswerving will Moulding the world, till man became Roman in soul and name. But now thou knew'st to take Another form of rule, and thou, who erst Didst march with mail-clad warriors, battling down Opposing wills, and first among the first, Won'st from a conquered world the hard-earned crown, Now like a cold black snake Around the blighted souls of men didst glide, And with feigned messages of doom, And monstrous fable and immoral threat, A womanish, subtle conqueror, didst set Thy foot upon mankind; nor trick, nor cheat, Nor secret craft, nor wile, nor dark deceit, Nor hypocrite pretence didst leave untried, Nor thought nor deed of gloom. Thy empire thou didst base on groans and sighs Of lifelong captives shut from life and love, And at thy bidding all the sacred ties Of home thou didst unloosen and remove All thought but thought for thee. So didst thou build Thy throne on suffering; while thy pontiffs sate 'Mid well-carved nymphs and pictures fair, And pagan joyance everywhere, And made their atheist fancies bold With philosophic sneers of old, As the augurs did; and in the sacred name Of God, careless, and flushed with wine, they filled The sanctuary with revel, and the shame Of lust of power and greed insatiate; And scoffed at Christ, and mocked the zeal Of those too faithful souls and pure, Whom faster far than chains or steel Their high religion could immure, And who from convent prisons sad, Their impious feasts made glad. Or these lewd triflers passed; and then, Worse tyranny of purer men, Stern zealots who, believing, sought To kill the sacred life of thought By scourge, and chain, and axe, and stake, And o'er mind's seething ocean spread Such calm as when the winds are dead; And not in vain, for year by year, Brought low by horrid chills of fear, The world's high pulse beat weak and faint, Till lying vision of sickly saint And fabulous dogma could replace The Pagan tenderness and grace. And o'er all lands thy priests swarmed far and near, Close to the blood-stained ruler's dying ear, With venal gloss for unrepented sin, And secret absolution; and did win The credulous faith of woman; and if e'er Some bolder soul, grown jealous, turned to God From all thy forgeries, it with dreadful fear, Torture, and dungeon, and the iron rod, And blood and fire, thou didst subdue To thine own ends, and with a hideous skill Thou madest the whole world bow before thy will, Till thy vast fable grew To a black nightmare, blighting heart and soul; And ever with thy prisons filled with pain, And thy dark shadow, blasting the world's brain, Slow did the weary hopeless centuries roll, And thou didst wax and batten on the blood Of the innocent and good. And then there came Another dawn with thunders, and the flame Of its red lightning flashed from soul to soul, And thought a waking giant rose and broke Thy hateful bonds, and soared on high and spoke The glorious thoughts which erst thou didst control: And the dread salutary storm of war Burst o'er unhappy Europe far; When the brave North from out its cold Gray, frozen plains rushed forth to meet The Pagan South, which at thy feet Had spent its manhood: and the bold High soul of England, she who sate Behind her sea-cliffs isolate: These spurned thy hateful yoke and thee, And, taking heart, grew great and free, And overspread the world; but thou, Knowing the voice of doom, Ruthless, with fire and sword didst trample out The nascent soul within thee, and enslave The whole fair South in blackest depths of gloom. There, in an ignorance too dark for doubt, And a worse death than that which feeds the grave, Thou didst engulf her. There did she remain, Dead, while life surged around her; joy, and pain, High hopes and aspirations, all forgot. There, chained to earth, the nations grovelled and were not, As many grovel now. Ah! glorious city, what pangs were thine In those long shameful years Cold as a corpse round which the grave-clothes twine, Thou drank'st the cup of tears; Thy vesture they divided, and did tear In sunder thine own Italy, fair and sweet. And thou could'st bear To see her trampled under alien feet! Sometimes thy sons, filled with such holy fire As in all time doth patriot hearts inspire, Would rear thy fallen Commonwealth once more In vain, or else by burning words would strive To make the dry bones of thine Empire live; And then time fled, and voice and arm would fail, And death and silence reign. The day of doom, Which touched the souls of men with tongues of flame, Broke not on thee. Upon thy living tomb Of that great travail whence the freeman came, Stole but a passing murmur, quickly gone; And then thy hateful life crept smoothly on, Untroubled, as before. The tyrants slew And worked their selfish schemes of petty wrong Upon thy Italy, yet no lightning flash Shot from thine eyes, O mighty mother, to dash The spoiler to the earth; for thou wast bound In womanish fetters: sunk so sad, so deep, In such a lifeless lethargy profound, That no cry came to break thy shameful sleep: So well thy crafty guardians knew To stop thine ears; while to the far Dim ends of earth they stretched their hands, Armed with all pitiless commands. And mental tortures worse than death, And sad confessions wrung from failing breath, And stamped out thought, and strove to still The world's great tumult to their will, And in this shameful mould recast Thy illimitable Past! Slow is God's purpose deep, And slow the cycles creep To the full end; and we who know Fruitless the long years come and go, Fruitless the brief lives lived and spent To change the old wrong impotent; Who, while we hopeless droop and fade Beneath thick Error's poison shade, See it to glorious stature rise, And lose its summit in the skies‚Äî See a false halo shed round crime, And error consecrate by time Grow weary of delay, and fain The eternal purpose to arraign. Ah! blind and weak of faith; for see, When least we think the thing shall be, By secret ways remote and still Fares on the one unchanging Will, By trackless paths; in seasons known To one Intelligence alone; And oft, when least we heed or think, Our footsteps tremble on the brink: And often, when we seem to hold The future, with its store of gold, Lo! quick the fairy gleam is gone, And leaves us hopeless and alone. So 'twas with thee: The furious storm of change had passed once more And left thee as before. There seemed no shadow on the glaring sky, No little cloud which any might descry; A time no more of wild imaginings; A time of mistresses and kings, Secret police, confessors, Bourbons, spies, Dark prisons filled with patriot sighs; Rome basking, with her vulture wings outspread, As if all nobler thoughts and dreams were dead; O'erall our Europe neither breath nor stir But dark intrigues of king and minister,‚Äî One deep corruption to replace The kindly ties of common race. Secure thou seem'dst of ruin, ay, secure, But, God be praised, not sure. For lo! from out that calm and silence deep, A loud and bitter cry! Europe, awaking from her nightmare sleep, Lifted her voice on high; And the peoples who long time had crouched before That subtle deadly yoke, Had risen again, had risen and once more The voice of freedom spoke,‚Äî Whispered first with a low unmeaning murmur; Then, 'mid fire and cannon smoke, Spoke out fearless, as, with hand and voice grown firmer The Revolution woke. And over many a fair and stately city The fiend of civil strife, Drunk with conquest, blind to reverence, dead to pity, Rose to an awful life,‚Äî Rose till all our Europe, trodden under The thing the priests had wrought, Rang with confused unmeaning thunder Of inarticulate thought; And the lonely dreamer, stern and crimson-handed, And the patriot mad with hope, And the Zealot and the Socialist, commanded More than Emperor or Pope; And they seized thee, and with joy and exultation Baptized thee, Common wealth; While thy Pontiff, long perplexed 'twixt Church and nation, Slunk out of thee by stealth; Till the legions of thy sister, France the glorious‚Äî She who once awoke the world‚Äî Over liberty and commonwealth victorious, Against thy life were hurled; And thou sankest down at last, though battling bravely For the freedom thou hadst won; Never losing heart, but striving sternly, gravely, Till hope and life were done; And o'er every race, from Germany enlightened To God-forgotten Spain, The chains of the oppressor's hand were tightened, The fetters forged again; Once more the informer ruled, the sleek confessor Sat by the ear of kings; A nightmare on the race, a dark assessor Prompting to shameful things: ‚ÄúAll things are mine,‚Äù the priest said; ‚ÄúI am master Of pomps, and thrones, and powers:‚Äù Nor marked the shadow ever gliding faster Of the inexorable hours! For slowly in Time's hidden womb Fate's secret forces did mature, The silent energies obscure The destinies of doom; And tiny Piedmont, set beneath the mountain To one foreseeing brain Seemed the prime source, the fair up-springing fountain Of Italy again. And craft, than priestcraft subtler still, And cunning and unswerving will, These worked in silence long; and then The rash Triumvir, king of men, The Roman without stain or guile, Rushed from his rocky sea-girt isle. And thy frank monarch marched, and he Who France enslaved but made thee free, And chased the spoiler out and broke his power, And drove him, beaten back, to fort and tower: And thou, rich Lombardy, wert free. And over thee, fair Tuscany, The onward flowing tide of freedom broke, And kingdom after kingdom woke, Till last on thee, O sweet South, bound In utter darkness, prisoned and confined, There broke with high tumultuous sound An echo of the mighty northern wind; Again the red-clad dreamer rose And rushed unarmed upon his foes, And did prevail‚Äîsuch strength there is in faith‚Äî And all the dark and hateful things that be, All gyves and instruments of tyranny, Fell from thy limbs and left thee free; And at thy prison gate And hideous, rayless cell, No more the gaoler sate, Making the Paradise God made, a hell. And all was free through Italy, free, free! From thy cold Alp to burning Sicily: Free everywhere, O Rome, except for thee And thy gray, silent Venice weeping by the sea! And then thy force seemed spent again, O Italy, and the slow crawling years Deferred thy fulness, till thy growing pain Prompted rash onsets checked in blood and tears; Yet, through defeat thou didst advance and gain Thy Venice, and through defeat And agony of Mentana didst advance To destiny complete, Till thy too jealous sister, France‚Äî She who with foreign fanatic and fool Did buoy thy oppressor's rule‚Äî She, by strong blows from the victorious North, Broken and crushed, and sunk in ruin, fell; And, with her trumpets sounding the swift knell Of priestcraft, Italy marched forth, And the priests' hirelings shrank and were afraid: And strong and calm, and gloriously arrayed, Thou saw'st at last her conquering legions come; And not in battle guise, or hasty strength But after patient waiting, and at length, Thy Italy came home! And time it was indeed She came; ay, it was time; for scarce had ceased The boldest utterance that ever priest Had launched against our race. Ay! it was time indeed. Scarce had the echoes died within the hall, Where the weird power which tottered to its fall Spake forth with insolent voice and threat more bold Than ever furious Pontiff launched of old,‚Äî Spake forth amid the sycophant crowd, The Jesuit suborned from every clime, The stolid Eastern left behind of time, The supple Italian mad for place; And those, the shame of every freeborn race, Who come to hate the liberty they know, And thoughts and lives that grow; Who into freemen's gatherings slip‚Äî Smooth actors false, who play their part With tolerance upon the lip And tyranny at heart. All these, and more, were there; And with intrigue, and trick, and wile, Did the indignant soul beguile, Till the mild zealot of the pagan chair Stood forth amid the thunder and the flame; Stood forth ‚Äî oh, blasphemy and shame!‚Äî Infallible ‚Äî oh, mighty mocking name!‚Äî Infallible o'er peoples and o'er kings, Infallible o'er earthly thoughts and things. Too late to stay the madness and the crime, Thou camest, O Italy. Ay, 'twas time, 'twas time! Yes! it was time. And now a Rome regenerate once more Amid her queenly cities sits sublime: Fair Venice, fresh like Cypris from the seas; Ravenna, dim with hoary memories; Milan, with spires of marble clustering white; Genoa, on terraced hillsides clear and bright; Florence, the flower of cities; and thou, fair town, On the blue crescent of whose bay, Though dynasties and nations pass away, The burning hill looks down That whelmed thy sisters;‚Äîthese And others, twinkling, like the Pleiades 'Mid the large stars, with gems of form and hue Fairer than e'er thy ancient Romans knew, Kneel round thee where thou sittest as a Queen, Re-clothed with all the glories that have been. The glories? Ay, but not the might. That to the colder North has flown, To where she lieth‚Äîshe, The little Island under grayer light, 'Mid loud perpetual surges of the sea, By boisterous winds o'erblown, Seated upon two hemispheres, and can teach, As thou couldst once, a universal speech; Or to the vast and thinly-peopled West, Unknown to thee, where humble homes are blest With deep content and plenty, though the State Seem rotten; or, it may be, to the great Vast form which broods o'er Europe like a cloud, As did thy Goths; or, maybe, to the strong, Stern race of banded freemen, which grows free Through bonds, and, gaining freedom, set thee free: Heirs of thy mail-clad legions gone before. Ah! mockery, that Time can do no more! Ay! the long centuries mock us as they roll; And we, we cannot tell To what far goal fares on the world's great soul, Whether to ill or well. Art thou indeed, black ghost, For ever taken from our eyes and fled, Among the hateful growths long lapsed and lost, Which now are sunk and dead? Or shalt thou from the coward fears of men Whose Faith is gone, whose God is fled, With black Night only overhead, Grow strong to blight again? Or shall a happier fate, great Church of old, The hidden riches of thy life unfold‚Äî Great Church which men have strangled! till we see What sacred treasures, more than gems and gold, What power of faith and ordered liberty, Thy nursing arms enfold? Grant it, O saints on earth and saints above, Who have made pure her foulness with your love; Grant it, pale monks, who from dim convent room Saw angels through the gloom;‚Äî Grant it, sweet ministering women; all Who raised, who raise to-day, the feet that fall; Who for fair works of mercy live, To pray, to work, to succour, and to give;‚Äî Limners devout who saw the mother mild Adore the Eternal Child, Oh saints! If e'er to mortal prayer 'tis given To speed the will of Heaven;‚Äî Grant that from out all changes there may come A new, regenerate Rome! We know not, but 'tis clear Her old dominion comes not, and 'tis well; For maybe, in some happy future near, Or maybe distant, comes a newer birth, A peaceful federation of the earth: Who shall discern or tell? Is it a dream? But in thy Senate, Rome, Which was a dream, a dreamer sits to-day‚Äî Two there were once, but one has passed away; The mightier, amid the happy dead He dreams not any more‚Äî And one there is who bends a whitened head, A happy dreamer, who fulfilled his dream, And has attained his home, And dreams to-day of Tiber's deepened stream White with the sails of yore; And dreams along thy poisoned, lonely plain‚Äî The work of long neglect and of the priest‚Äî The sounds of happy toil which long have ceased, The vine and corn again; The peace, the plenty, which thy Romans knew; The glory, not the dominance of old; The waving wheat, or maize with sheen of gold; And, where the robber lurks upon the hill, Again the purple clusters fill: Science to knit a long-dissevered race, And mild-eyed, gradual knowledge to efface, By tranquil method subtly strong, The centuries of ignorance and wrong; The priest no ruler, but a friend To guide the feeble feet that heavenward tend; Choosing, in place of old tyrannic rule, The simple teaching of the school, The vespers in the twilights dim, The children's voices in the innocent hymn, The blessed, saintly souls which take A life of pity for their Master's sake, A fuller life than that the Pagan knew; O dreamer, dream thy dream, and dream it true! AT A COUNTRY HOUSE. Pledged to lampoon, all night I strive to think, Thoughts black and mordant as their kindred ink, In vain! A stern voice whispers me ‚ÄúForbear‚Äù! Write only this, ‚ÄúThe maid is good as fair.‚Äù TIME AND FATE. With thirst for Love and Fame, unsatisfied, Ere yet my morning hours had come to noon, Fate with austere denial came and cried, ‚ÄúAwait thy Hour. Too soon, thou com'st, too soon.‚Äù But with the afternoon, Time stealing brought Grey hairs and sunken cheek and duller brain, ‚ÄúToo wan,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúfor love, too cold for thought; Too late,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äútoo late; thy quest is vain.‚Äù Therefore I do arraign ye cruel pair, Perjured conspirators, both Time and Fate, For the deep grudge ye twain to mortals bear, Crying, ‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù too soon, ‚ÄúToo soon,‚Äù too late. WALES: TO-DAY AND TOMORROW. Written as a prelude to a collection of essays issued in 1907 under the same title. Once more, oh gracious Muse, once more again Thy ancient kindness deign To a spent bard, whose failing voice and quill Halt to obey his will. What is it that his labouring tongue would speak With accents thin and weak? What message to the Future from the Past, Late, and may be, the last? This only: ‚ÄúBrethren of the Cymric blood, Unity, concord, harmony.‚Äù No more As in the narrower ages gone before Let jealous strifes hinder the common good. Ours is a little land, see that there be Deep peace from Menai to the Severn sea, From towered Carnarvon to the mystic shrine Where lone Ty Ddewi dreams of things divine, Let all our land with one consentient voice In our re-risen Cambria rejoice. Summon her from her tomb: let the sad years‚Äî This is no time for memories wet with tears‚Äî Fall from her as the grave-clothes from the dead; Put off the outworn legends of the Past, Belov√©d, reverend, head, Come forth, arise, thy hour has struck at last. Come forth, oh mother land! Awaking, come Proclaim thy thought, thou art no longer dumb. I know not what these varied pages tell; What civic lesson teach, or heavenward creed; So they take thought for thee, dear land indeed, And seek to aid thy future, it is well. Let thought, with emulous thought combined, inspire New themes more worthy of the bardic lyre Than those once sung within the ashen grove; Themes fired with loftier warmth of larger love For this our little plot of native earth, Dear Cambria of our birth, ‚ÄúRough but a nurse of worthies,‚Äù as was told Of Sparta in the heroic days of old. Keep thou, as still thou wilt, thy ancient tongue For glowing prayer and solemn music sung, Which each returning Sabbath swells, and fills A thousand shrines within thy folded hills, Yet scorn not thou the universal speech Which to a listening world our brethren teach. Through commerce, and the victories of peace, March on and let thy Fate with theirs increase. Dear land, arise, come forth, nor ever more, Brooding apart where thy cowled mountains rise Monk-like against the skies, Forget to mingle with thy neighbour race, His vigour and thy grace. Come forth: thy sons, grown equal to their fate, Serving as never yet, the Imperial State Are learning to grow great. Unite, dear land, march on united still By one consentient and constraining will, And dare what lofty fate, untried before, God's purpose holds in store! ON FOUR PATRIOT BROTHERS. Written as a preface to the ‚ÄúMorris Family‚Äù letters, now in course of publication, 1907. Four patriot brothers of the Cymric race Of low estate, but sprung from gentle blood‚Äî These letters, hidden long, shall serve to trace Their life-long love for Gwalia and her good. All held their country dear, all prized as we Her long heroic Past, her ancient tongue That blossoms still, her strong sons' bravery, Her songs, by lover and by warrior sung. Here, through their own quaint use of either speech We know them, now their native accents tell The story, now in nervous Saxon, each Brother to brother speaks, and both are well. Here no unreal eulogy arrays The dead in robes not theirs, nor partial hand Obscures with insincere or venal praise, Foibles, it profits well to understand; But each fraternal soul with honest care Reveals itself; unchanged thro' time and change And absence, still its inner life lays bare, Nor thro' the estranging mists of years grow strange. But frank and boyish still, can ne'er forget, 'Mid service of the State and lofty place, The handicraft, the farm, and lingering yet The sire's shrewd wit, the mother's kindly grace. Long in close concord, lived they till the call, Sounded too soon, which comes alike to all, And severed here the gracious brotherhood Knit fast by patriot aims and common blood. John, first, the sailor comes, whose bright young life Perished 'neath Carthagena's frowning wall, Fallen in conquering Britain's worldwide strife, As still, to-day, her youthful lives must fall; A new, yet henceforth, a belov√©d name, Frank, bold, warm-hearted, whom his mother's heart Mourned long, who went too soon, may be, for fame, But not to have played, and well, his manly part. Then gentle William, whose home-keeping thought Strayed never far from Mona's windswept shore, Whom Nature‚Äîherb, shell, flower, and fossil‚Äîtaught To reverence her Maker, more and more. Nor loved these only, but to bring to light The buried Cymric lore, his kindly hand Sowed broadcast, not for lucre, o'er the land, Treasures half-hidden, or forgotten quite. Dear to his brethren, dear to Wales, to all Who loved the unselfish care which freely gave Rich store; which heard the buried ages call And raised them from oblivion and the grave. Then Richard, who 'mid London's emulous throng Rose high, from ‚ÄúM√¥n the mother,‚Äù exiled far, And served content, laborious years and long, Our thundering navies, waging ceaseless war, Yet still remembered Gwalia and the debt He owed her, and her sons, and willing lent His scanty leisure, scorning to forget Those who, 'mid alien myriads, lonely, spent, Pined for her, but with Lewis strove to bind A link of union, which, renewed to-day, Knits Cymric lives together heart and mind And cheers the exile's solitary way; Who, when his life-long toil seemed now complete, Gave all his Cymric learning to make plain In the old tongue the Word, and guide men's feet On the strait heavenward path, nor toiled in vain. And Lewis, chief of all the noblest far, My dear sire's grandsire, whose protecting hand Long saved Goronwy from himself, a star Waking the brooding twilight of his land, Who lived for her, yet loved his Britain well, Artificer, musician, scholar, bard, Philosopher, antiquary; who men tell With wonder, no achievement found too hard; Wise, many-tongued, like his young kinsman great, Sir William Jones. Who sang how freemen best can build the State, The blameless Poet-jurist long at rest, Here, beneath Paul's high dome, there, with the Blest; Who with skilled hand the Celtic roots laid bare Wherefrom in name and speech our Gwalia grew; The annals buried deep, the fancies fair, The hoary faiths, our dim forefathers knew: Who framed the harp with fingers deft and strong, And drew his music from it, who could build A bark and sail it forth, a seaman skilled, Or pen an Ode and wing its words with song, And traced the hidden secrets of the mine, And mapped the treacherous shallows of the sea; Strong soul, of all these lavish gains of thine, Nought, but the gift of verse, descends to me! But more than all the conquests of his brain, His generous hand, I prize, his noble heart To which no struggling bard appealed in vain For help or guidance in his sacred Art. And yet the jealous schemers year by year Assailed him, planned his fall, denied his skill, Drove him with brutal mobs in mortal fear (Hard lot is his, who scales the Olympian Hill!) To the cold alien city far away, Sickening for home, to meet alone the hate Of selfish men, the cruel Law's delay, The jealousies of the intriguing Great; And face them all unfriended, unafraid, ‚ÄúThe proud, hot Welshman,‚Äù who the Crown's high trust, Never thro' all that weary strife betrayed, But kept the scornful silence of the just; Till at the last, when the long fight was done, Broken in frame, although with victory won, Leaving the Law's chicane, the knavish Great, He turned contented, though of poor estate, To the scarred hill by the forsaken deep Of lone Goginan: there he knew at length The homely, restful life, the new-found strength Of sitting still, the nights' untroubled sleep, Tending his brood of childish lives, the wife Loved well and long; aiding his neighbours round With simple leechcraft; rapt in dreams profound, Of Science and the riddle of our life; Now like some fabled alchemist of old, Armed with retort and crucible, the ore Of his loved hills assayed, now mid the lore Of Celtic annals delved and won their gold; Now grappling with the Electric mysteries, Now penning the swift Englyn, or high Ode, Watching contented, 'neath the autumnal skies, His ruddy orchards bear their annual load. As they bear still, and I, as doth indeed How many a pilgrim from the Atlantic main! Last Autumn, tasting, sowed a little seed In memory of that precious heart and brain; And him who, while he breathed, a patriot yet, Through cares and painful age and limbs outworn, Did never the old race and tongue forget, Nor the lone, wind-swept isle, where he was born. Good brothers, Lewis, Richard, William, John, The fire ye kindled burns unfailing on Dead nigh two ages, but remembered yet, May these your words forbid men to forget! I would ye might return to earth and view By ‚Äúdark Llewelyn's‚Äù grave, the stately shrine The peasants reared, where youths and maids combine In emulous studies, part inspired by you; I would ye might return awhile and know The awakening of the subtle Cymric brain, And see to what high fates your Wales doth grow, And mark your brotherhood renewed again. Four brothers of your blood, alike in name, All looking to the Wales that is to be, And one who, of the patriot company Of Pioneers, enjoying modest fame, At Penbryn, like his ancestor, grows old, Leaving the din, the dust, the soil of Town, And hastening ere his heart and brain grow cold, With these last strains his bardic lyre lays down, Good brothers, worthy patriots, faithful, just, I, who have lived my life and loved you long, Bring this hereditary wreath of song And lay it willing on your honoured dust; And bless the pious hands which long time kept These ancient records, while our Gwalia slept, And murmur o'er each lone far-distant grave, O Dad yn dy dangnefedd, cadw ef. A LAST VISION. Oh, wonder! oh, transport! Oh, ecstasy! that fills the purg√®d sight With beams of golden light. And is this then the old familiar Earth, Or a new sphere gained by a second birth? As waking from my cloistered slumbers deep, I spurn the caves of sleep. Oh, wonder surpassing! A hundred suns for one, with constant light, Awake the ethereal air and banish Night; Sleep shrinks abashed, and sleep's halfsister Death, Nor Time disturbs, nor Age, nor failing breath, While high ineffable rhythms roll around Harmonious waves of sound. Oh, glory! oh, rapture! For lo! the troubles and the toils are past, Done are the chequered years of Earth at last, The wandering footsteps on the unlighted way; Here the new Dawn ushers unfailing Day. Oh, calm effulgence from a cloudless sky! Spirit! is this to die? Oh, marvel, oh, glory! For see once more the lost are here again, Unchanged in aught, yet purged of earthly stain; And lo! the saints, the sages, a white throng Chanting with accents clear the Eternal song, Martyrs of Truth who braved in every age The World's despite and rage. Oh, vision enchanting! Here there is work for all! dutiful, blest, Sweeter and higher far than idle rest, Work that exalts the man above the brute; Laborious days that never fail of fruit; Forces that faint not; brains that never tire; Souls that aspire! aspire! Oh, wonder amazing! Lo! 'tis the self-same world, tho' seeming strange, By some ineffable change, And such transforming radiance grown divine As never on the sad old Earth might shine. And bark, the long-hushed tones of homely love, And lo! the clear calm eyes which looked above. Yea, here or leagues beyond the farthest sun Nor life, nor love are done!</field>
