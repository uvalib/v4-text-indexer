      <field name="fulltext">The most famouse and worthie Historie, of the worthy Lady Pandauola, daughter to the mighty Paynim, the great Turke. The historie of Pandauola. Sometime in Turky there, A famouse lande by name, Did dwell a k?g whose daughters fare Deserued immortal fame: So bewtifull she was, So fette of lymme and ioynte, That sure a worlde it was to see, Her shape from point to point. So comly to be knitte, For witte she bare the bell, Her comly shape all other wightes For bewtie did excell: Her grace is such to see That heauen it was to heare And see, what suters was to get This worthy royall peare: As thicke as starres in skies So thicke the people be, In euery place the comly corps Of this Princes to see. The lusty gentell knightes, On foaming steades on hie, Her loue to wynne, their manly force Full often there doe trie. And demyng in their myndes That he that once should haue The victory, auaunce more nede not Of her, her loue to craue. Therfore they haue decreede A tournament to crie, In which they thinke with dynte of sworde Their harnes for to trie. Then to the king they go With one assent, and saie: We thee desier most royall Lorde, To graunt without delaye. A tournament to be, Our forces for to trie, Your presence likewyse there we craue, The playe to bewtifie. This is all our request, This is that we doe craue: Thus shall you doe a gratefull thing, If our requestes we haue. The king foorthwith doth graunte, To their request in deede, And biddeth them prepare them selues, To trie them selues with speede. And thus their leaue they take, And homeward take their waye: And euery oure they thinke a yeere, Before that come the daye. The daie then being come, In glistring armour bright: One might beholde on coursers tale, Full many a manly knight. With speare and lannce in hande, I clad in plate of steele, Naught wanting there, that might become A manly knight so wele. But first of all it doth Behoue for to descriue, The maner of the place, wherein These lusty knightes should striue. Without the Palaise great Of Sylewma the king, Appointed was the field, which was Made compasse like a rynge; In ether ende whereof Was mightie pillers sette, To which the parties ouercome, By forse of armes were fette, And there the lawe was so, That then they must abide, Untill such time that other were Toke of the other side. And at one ende there was, Appointed for to stande, Pandauola for whom this broile, They first had tooke in hande. And all the companie Of Ladies of great prise, Stoode there beside, within a place That was made there likewyse. At thother end the king, Did sitte with all his traine: And in the middes were Judges sette, Indifferent for them twayne. Thus passed was the night, And daie began tappeare: And trompettes blew in euery place, The sound eche wight might heare. Then first in field there came, The king and tooke his place: And afterward Pandauola, Came with her fathers grace. And tooke her seate where as She, pointed was and then The harrauldes foorth are sent to shew Unto these lusty men How that the king was set, And wayted them to see, Wherefore the trompettes are commaunde Foorthwith I bloun should be, The Martiall seas that none Doe come within the rayle: Then comes the knightes and to their king, Their bonettes they doe vayle. But one among the rest, That Alfine had to name, Is chalenger and must beginne To showe this royall game. A comly knight he was, Pandauolas one deare: And she to him did speake these woordes, Euen with a mery cheare, My Lord (quod she) you see, That naught can here auayle, But stripes with courage bold and stout, Your foes for to assaile. And for your party I Am sure good knightes to haue: And nought there wantes but courage bolde, From daunger you to saue. And courage stoute I knowe, Doth you possesse and holde, Wherby your foes neuer so stoute, May easy be controulde: Go wende in haste therfore, Prepare your selfe to fight: And for to honor you the more, We will giue you the sight. To whom he aunswered, If that I so might craue: Your gloue or sleue, then might I thinke, The victorie to haue. Oh Lady deare therfore, Graunt this my small desier: And then I thinke for my desert, I am repaide my hier. This saide, her gloue she drawes From of her fingers small, And giues to him and eke a ringe, She giueth there withall. Who nowe doth ioye but he, Who els desires to fight But he, then straight the defendant, Is come redy in sight. Who Flaccus had to name, And after him doth ryde, The brother of this Alfine looe, A man of litle pride. When as before the kyng They came, they license craue, That they the field as doth behoue, May full possesse and haue. To trie their lusty steedes, Their hartes and harnes strong, And eke to trie which of them all Should lay other along. The king hath graunted them, The trompettes straight doth blowe, With speare in reste these manly knightes Thone at thother goe. He that in fielde then was, Must learne his head to saue, Or els may chaunce appointed be, To lie full long in graue. Their speares that well were whette, On harnise chrasshing crie, And other some how swoordes will holde Upon their helmettes trie. But Flaccus Alfine markes, And straight at him doth ronne, But Alfine falling on his men, This worthy knight doth shonne. But he with cruell hate Aloude in fielde doth crie: Oh Alfine, Alfine, where art thou That pointed hast to trie? With me by force of armes The gloue and ringe to haue, Come forth I saie, both the and thine, Against me se thou saue. When Alfine harde him crie After this kynde of wise, His harte for Ire began to quake, His bloud began to rise. And setting sporres to horse, He brake his foes araye, And smyteth Flaccus in the shelde, That on the grounde he laye. Then Alfine striues to drawe This Flaccus lacking breth Unto the piller there beside, But Brennus rescueth This Flaccus, and vpon His brother Alfine falles, With mortall dynte of sworde, Aloude to him he calles. O brother tourne thee nowe, I doe thee here defie, And if thou be a gentill knight, Seeme not for to denie, To meete me here in fielde, Sithe that fortune hath so Appointed vs, then both at once, Togeather they doe go: And rushing here and there, How for to sytte they trie: And thone at thother ranne so sore, Their speares in peeces flie. But by this time Flaccus, His selfe was come vnto, And armed now his foes in field, Doth mortaly pursue. But meting once againe, With Alfine in the field, Of courage and of ire he doth Unto the soldiers yield, Such bloes that none before, His swoorde durst once to stand, And hauing made a way by force, He ioyneth hand to hand, With Alfine and they both, At once to ground are caste: And then they both agreed are, Retrete to blowe at laste. The rest for to deferre, Untill the sunne began For to descende possessing earst, His place Meredian. The king vnto the court Anone doth take his waye, Pointing an our or two I wis Within his place to staye. And then for to retourne, The ende hereof to see, Agreed they are and in the court To dinner gone they bee, But lo Pandauola, Hath caught a mortall blowe, Euen with a shafte that was shot foorth From out dame Cupides bowe. Her harte was set on fire, And she began to burne, The rosis in her ruddey cheekes, Began awaye to turne. Her senses doe denie, Their offices to doe: Her breath doth fayle and men doe looke, But death for to insue. She eates no meate at all, But downe on bed is laide: But at the last her eies out brast With teares, and thus she saide. Oh Gods that rule the skies, In whome my trust doth lie, And thou O God whiche chiefest arte Aboue the golden skie. And thou oh Lady deare, Oh Venus by thy name, Vouchsaue my wofull crie to heare, Thy captiue doe not blame: Though that alwayes I sought, Thy forse for to withstande: Yet nowe I feele the mighty stroke Of Cupide thy sonnes hande. Take pitie now therefore Sithe that a captiue I: Can not preuaile, yet giue me salfe To helpe my misery. And take me to thy grace, Sythe that my selfe I yelde, And graunte to smyte him with that shafte Thou hittes me in the fielde. Oh Cupide I the praie, This whyle the knightes are gone Them selues to dine and rest their corps, But Alfines layd vpon His bedde, and doth complaine, Of heuy woes and smart, Which for Pandauola his dere, Doth vexe him at the harte. The king hath heard hou that His daughter doth not well, And sendeth for Phisitians In conning that excell, To knowe the cause of griefe, That doth her so molest, And eke of them to knowe what kinde Of medicines are beste. Her health againe to gette, The messengers are gone, Whome the Phisitions aunswere, That they will wayte vpon His prudent grace, as fast As possible they may: And with the messengers they all To court doe take their way. The game is then deferde Untill an other tide: And postes for Phisitians yet, About the countrey ryde. In meane space she with paine Is vext, and greuous smart: And cruell cares with great anoye, Tormente her gentill harte. At last the Phisitions, Are come her grace to see: But oh alas there is none can tell, To cure her maladie. The king doth weepe and wayle, His daughter thus to see: At last of them he doth inquire, If any helpe there be? To whom they aunswere made, With heuy pending cheare: That naught but death in her at all To their sight did appeare, For liuely bloud was gone, Her poulses did not beate Her limmes waxt starke for want of bloud, And of her liuely heate. Her sensis all are dull, And death approched nye, But this they said vnto the kyng, Their cunning they would trye: Her health againe to get, Hir Ladies sitte her by, And doth beholde how now and then, She tournes her heuy eye: As though that Atropos Should ende her vitall race: And eke that nature quite and cleane, Her worke should so deface. The place with waylinges great, Is filde vnto the ende, The Phisitions the company Out of the chamber sende. Then they their medicines, Unto this lady giue: The whiche opprest with cares beginnes Againe for to reliue. The king is this meane while Within his chamber set, To whom a messenger is come, And thus the king doth greete. The Gods thee saue O king, Thy seruaunt still doth praye, Alfine thy knight desireth thee, To graunt without delaye, A phisition with speede His maladie to cure: Or els oh king that he shall die, Thereof thou maiest be sure. To whome the king thus spake, What greater griefe can be, Unto a king then for to lose, So good a knight as he. Ah fortune that doest beare, A double face in hood Ne knowest thy frende ne fo, but doest Unto them equall good. And him thou settest on hie, Euen him thou laiest alowe: As to thy friend suche frendlines, Thou showest vnto thy foe. With weping teares he saide, And then he foorth doth call His Phisitions, and doth commaunde That they go with him all, Unto Alfine his knight, With that Pandauola Began to speake to one that stoode Her by, and thus did saye. And is it true I heare? Is Alfine sicke also? She called then a Phisition, And bad him straight to goe To him in all the haste, And tell him this that she Is ready nowe for to departe, But lackes his companie. To whome she might as mate, With him take paine in waye: The Phisition did thinke that she These woordes of feare did saye. And like a wise man then, He aunswered by and by, Be you content ho lady deare, Thinke not that he will die But if you will commaunde, I will your will obay, And willingly will doe the thing That it shall please you saye. And if that death should carpe My vitall thread atwaine, Your secretes I will keepe still close Though that I should be slaine. With that she drew her breath, But fainting nowe and then, Ah God (quod she) Alfyne Alfyne, The truste of all men: With that as men perceiue By little streames that ronne The place, and cause that first their course Of water hath begonne: Or as one might perceaue Where eaco doth resounde, That in that place though touching skie It is their hollowe grounde. So he when as he harde Her clamor and her crie, Knewe well in ende that such streames would Their fountaine head discrie. And as the man that hath By trauell and by payne Founde out, where as of golde there is Some riche and costly vaine: Doth digge and delue the more, The ende therof to finde: So he a conning workeman doth Reuolue within his mynde Whereof their wordes should ryse, He then perceiueth plaine The cause of grief and seketh meanes Her woes for to restraine, And then beginning newe His tale to her he said, Oh Lady, of my woordes be not One whitte at all dismaid. For I in ende I hope Will fynde you for to ease, So that my seruice may not once Your gracious minde displease, My frend (quod she againe) No whit shall me displease. What that it be, saye what you will So it be for any ease, And I the truth will tell, But see you trusty be Of all the cause and where I am Thus vexte with malady, To whom he aunswered, The Gods by whome eche thing, Was made, quighte me confounde, And vnto ruine bring, Euen at that instaunt, when Your secret I bewray: And bring my soule where furis fell Shall it moleste I pray, That I may with him gape That sekes the floudeds to drinke, And for my plague from yarning lips The same againe may shrynke, Or els that carping gripe, That eates the groing harte Of Titius, in sonder may My faithles harte departe. And if in hell there be One that surmountes the reste For breache faith, then let it all Be iudged for my breste, As due rewarde and eke, If naught in hell there be, Sufficient, then mighty Joue Against me thus decree, That I with those may haue My towme, whome Joue most hie, Did fling to ground by thonder boltes That flew from forth the skie. And now their toumes possesse Where as their corps doth boyle With fier and brymstone scalding hote, Their corpes for to tourmoyle. This saide he thus began, No Phisition (quoth he) Can minister vnto your health, Unlesse that perfeitly The cause of griefe he knowes, His labour is in vaine, And lost is all his study, for To ease you of your payne. Therfore of you I craue The principall to knowe Of all your griefe, and then I will Some phisick therfore showe. Your vryne doth declare That you in deede are ill, A cause the same doth showe also, But not contentes my will. For further cause I must Of you here vnderstande, And then I may giue medicines To you, ende out of hande. As when the gentill Buck Hath take a mortall blowe, Doth runne about to seke some ease, So she about doth goe. With sugered woordes to tell Howe she at harte was prest With greuous panges, and afterwardes In order all rehearst. What maladie she felt Within her selfe, but she Did not declare what was the cause, Of her great maladie. At last she cries Alfyne, And there her voyce doth staye. The Phisition perceiued the cause, And thus began to saie: Oh Lady mine take cheare, The cause of all I finde To be the loue of Alfyne, which You so doe beare in mynde, Therfore take you no thought, For I will woorke the waye That shall you ease, therfore your self In quiet state doe staie. I will to Alfyne go, Your minde to him to breake, And if your graces will be so I beseeche you to speake. With that she tournes and toste As though she straight will die, And thus at last to him she spake With heuy dolefull eye. O syr (quoth she) you knowe The cause of all my care, For Alfyne low it is, that I This greuous sicknes bare. And sithe you nowe doe knowe What is the cause of wo, As for my frende I doe you take, My secretes doe not showe. Content your selue a whyle Quoth he, and let me worke, To Alfyn I will straight wayse wend To ease him of his hurte: And afterward I will Againe come vnto you, And as for me, oh Lady deare, As friend doe thinke me true, Well then (quod she) syth that You must be gyde, of gayne Take here this gold the which I giue For part reward of paine, And sithe to him you go, To him this ringe doe giue, And tell him that without his loue, I desire not to liue, And if to doe him good, My death could ought auaile, To haue the same without delay, Sure, sure, I would not faile. This saide, the Phisition To Alfyne straight doth goe, Who wh? he came straight to the kinge This ioyfull newes doth showe. That he did hope in time His daughter well to see, Wherof the king exceading ioyse To Alfyne gone to be. And telles the king that he His disease well doth see, And will in time without all doughte Finde out a remedy For him, and then he doth Them all with harte desire For to depart, the king and all Doth that he doth require. When all was foorth of dores, He thus his tale began: Right worthy Syr, I doe perceiue That you are a sick man, And sore torment with paine, But be you of good cheare, For from a frende of yours I haue A message good to heare. The worthy knight then said, Good syer welcome to me, And for her sake that hath you sent Right welcome syr ye be. With that the Phisition Began on this same sorte, The Gods confounde me, if my tonge Shall forder false reporte. Good syr (quoth he) eache thing Obedient needes must be, Unto the will of him that made Those thinges, as thinges to see. And as the hounde which is His maisters great delight, Unto the hare by nature made Doth daily worke despight. Or as the sylley doue No greater ioye can finde When as she in loue is macht With one of selfe same kinde. So mortall man though he Be kinge and lorde of all, Yet in this point w? him eache beast Is to their Lorde equall, And thus beside we see As Cupide shaft doth fall, So oftentimes the feruent loue Departeth there withall. And for because that loue Is cause of your vnreste, Therfore I thinke the principall To shewe it were the best. Oh sier said Alfyne then, My honor doth not craue That though my loue so feruent be, That I the same should haue, And if so be that I In byrth her grace might mate, Yet doe I thinke that worthy I Were not for such a state As she, but would be glad If I were king of kinges, Euen for her sake, to leaue my state, And eke all royal thinges. And if I might haue hope To craue I could not sease, If I were sure my sute to gaine, No happier is the peace That with a tound is made When warres indured hath Ful long th? were with me, I swere Of knighthod by the faithe. But out alas her witte And iudgement sage is so, That of my sute when I beginne To faile, in ende I know. Therfore maister Doctor, I you desire and praie, In any case of her no more Unto me for to saye, But let me in destres Now end my dolefull dayes And let me die remediles Sithe I haue bene alwayes. To whome the Doctor spake And bad him quiet be, For so he saide that somewhat might Ease him of maladie. And if he would a whyle His talke giue eare vnto, He might haue ease, and Alfyne he, Is willing so to do. With that he thus began, And saide, I maruell much That for to shew such one as you For feare so sore should grutche, To doe the thing wherby To you comes all the gaine, And it were so, why should you shrinke To take so small a paine, Sithe labour can not lose, Parhappes she does to trie Your faithfulnesse, and other whyles, Perhappes she doth denie To graunt you that you craue, Because she would that ye Should not suppose in your conceit Her person light to be, Therfore this would I wyshe, That you should courage take, And in the walles with manly hart Should seeke a breache to make For once the citie which Can scarse there defence make, Doth giue vnto the conquerer A hope it for to take, And where they willing are, No treate ought to be: The Sea to ebbe and flowe so oft Is not constrainde we see, Yet doth it so therfore Of courage take some part, And do assaie yet once againe To breake her flinty hart. For as the litle droppes That oft fall from on hie, The hardest stone with falling on, Both thorowe weare and trie, So she with praiers fayre, May be obtainde I knowe, Therfore good syr, and if you please my counsell do folowe. To whom Alfyne answerd, Good syr as you do saye, I doe intende the chaunce to proue Without any delaye. And for your great good will, I giue you thankes certaine, And if it lie in me one daye I will rewarde your paine. And sitting then vpright Within his bed, he saide, That for to prosecute his mynde, He would not be afraide. And geuing thankes as then The Phisicion vnto, He purposeth as he hath saide, Forth with end so to doe, The Phisition perceiued That then he might haue time To shewe his mynde, and thus he said, If not committing crime, I might my message showe, So bould then I would be To speake in few, to whome y? knight Did aunswere courtously Saie on, oh Doctour myld With willing harte certaine We will you heare, if to declare That you will take the paine. Then with a mery cheare, On this wyse he did say: I haue (quoth he) before I came Haue ben that part of daie. With faire Pandauola The daughter of the king, Which vnto me before I came Hether, gaue me this ring With this in message to Declare vnto your grace, That you would be of a good cheare, She prayes in any case: And as a token of Her faith she this hath sent, To you protesting that she hath As yet no other ment, Ne neuer tendes to doe While life she doth possesse, And so that you will like protest She verely doth gesse, As when a man hath lost Some Juell riche of pryse, With heuy hart and painfull mind He ginneth for to ryse, And so the Juell great He seketh round about, And neuer seaseth till that he The Juell hath founde out. And when that he hath founde The same, vp to the skeyse He liftes his handes, the Joyse whereof Makes streames runne downe his eyes, So plaieth Alfine nowe, With teares he blotes his face, And stretching out his heuy armes, The Doctor doth imbrace. And kissing twyse the ringe, Upon her name doth call, And eke beholde he feles him selfe Reliued therewithall. And willing with his harte The equall will to be Equaly macht, sithe her goodwill To his will so did gree. And douting nothing nowe, He thinkes him well at ease, Minding the Doctor for his paynes With golde and fee to please. Then doth the Doctor saie, That he would also wende Unto Pandauola, and askes If ought that he would sende As token vnto her, To whiche he doth consent, And vnto her a chaine with ring Withall his hart hath sent. The Doctor goes his waes, Well rewarded for paine: And wished that he were daily So set a woorke againe, Who nowe doth Alfyne loue, But Pandauola bright, Who is to him coequall mate Who ioyeth nowe in light. What payne doth Alfyne feele, Ne all is fled away, He of his griefe is reliued, To ryse he doth assaie: And taking courage bolde, To walke he doth assaie: And feling not him selfe at ease, Againe on bed he laye With ioyfull cheare I wis He sate as any wight, He taketh then his pen in hande, And thus began to wrighte. And seking for to feede His flinging fancies so, Purposith in some prety songe His Ladies praise to showe. And thus he doth beginne, Desiring helpe and ayde Of Musis nyne, and thus at last With pleasaunt voyce he saies. The song made by the Translator. You Musies nyne that sisters be, Helpe now my dolefull voyce to singe, The prayse of her whose comly gle Surmounteth nowe eche vitall thing, The same whiche so Appelles sought, At once in her is trimly wrought. Appelles O thou happy man, Whose daies to short were for to see The floure that of dame nature came, So faire, so trimme, and eke so free, Whose shape doth passe all in the time, Much more then snow doth passe the slime. If thou hadst liued and sene the wight Which now doth liue in Turky lande, As one deuoyde of life and sight, Before her grace thou wouldest stande, Such w?dring would haue toke the there Her worthy shape in minde to beare. Pigmalion for all his arte, So faire a peece once could not graue, Nor if they both should take a part, By conning so their fames to saue Yet should they eare and not come nere My Ladies grace that royall peare. To whome I wishe eternall ioye, With healthfull state and happy dayes, And eke to passe without anoye, These euill times and perilous seas, And I my selfe what euer betide, With her in shippe on them may ryde. Finis. This done he layes him downe Some rest on bed to take, And afterward within an houre, He ginneth for to wake. The Phisition is come Pandauola to see, But lo, the king and all his Lordes Within her chamber be, To whome the Doctor ginnes To drawe him selfe vnto, And coming in, Pandauola He asketh howe she doe. To whome she aunsweres then, The better him to see: And of the same she asked then Wheare he so long hath bee. He aunswered straightwaye, He was for to prouide For certain things that nedes he must For her haue in that tide, But then she ginnes to saye The weather hote to bee, The Phisition that her intent Did well perceiue and see. And did the Lordes desire, A while them selues to keepe Abroade in chamber there beside, To see if she could slepe. The king then doth departe And all the Lordes are gone According to their duties, The king to wayte vpon. When all was foorth of doores, The Phisition doth tell The order of his being there, And howe eche thing befell. And vnto her doth giue The tokens that were sent By him to her, and afterwards He showes the whole intent Of Alfynes sicknes then, She him desires againe, That early on the morowe he To come will take the payne, To her, and then he shall Knowe more of her intent. To whose requeste, the Phisition Doth thorowly consent, And then his leaue doth take Till time of her request: And she her selfe doth laie her down, And there doth take her rest. The sunne from height of heauen Into the sea doth fall, And r?ning through the flashing flods Ascendeth there withall. And being weary then Of his iourney God wote, He putteth out the monstrous hores From out the chariot. And comming now where as Aurora hell her see, To make the night somewhat longer, They both agreed be: At length Aurora doth The bed of Titan flye, And ginnes to shewe her cristall face Throughout the syluer skie. And Phebus he him selfe His goulden head doth showe: Lifting him selfe from out of the waues Our orisont belowe. And with his fyrie chaire Is flowne into the skie An houre long, the Phisition Perceiueth by and by, That time it is to go, And foorth straightwaies he went Unto Pandauola, and she Unto his house hath sent, But at the last he comes And vnto her doth go, Desiring that he may foorthwith Her graces intent knowe. To whome she straight did saye, That he forthwith must beare A letter vnto Alfyne, whiche You after all shall heare. The Letter of Pandauola to her louer Alfyne. As to the heuy wight Tormented sore with paine, All thinges are ioyfull that doth seeke His tormentes to restraine. So it is vnto me O Alfyne, this to heare, That life with health y? dost possesse That art to me so deare. Which all the gods I praye For euer to maintayne, And good successe in all assaies, I wishe to the certaine The cause why that to you My letters I indighte Is this, because you may suer thinke My promyse to be right, And that the Doctor hath Unto your goodnes tolde, To be the thing which I doe meane Therof you may be bolde. And for your sicknes lo I rew, this thing is plaine, But yet suppose that much more ill Then you, I was againe. As well my father could Declare, and Doctor to, Who as you know for me in deede Hath had somewhat to doe. And sithe the Gods doe so Graunt our requestes to be: This is the cause that you foorthwith Come hether me to see, And thereof myne intent, The ende shall you perceiue: And thus because of leasure I You to your selue do leue. Fare well therfore my knight, Good health the Gods the sende: And thus from the kings manor place My minde and wryght I ende: Fare well oh Juell deare, Fare well my owne delight: Fare well also of knighthoode thou The chiefe and truest knight. This letter she doth geue The Phisition vnto, And bad him that in all the haste He should his labour doe The same in haste to beare, Alfyne to vnderstande: And afterwardes to bring to her An aunswere out of hande. The Phisition is gone Alfyne her knight vnto, According to her graces wyll, The message for to do. The meane spase she from out Her wery bed doth ryse, And deckes her selfe in trimme aray After her wonted gyse. And walking up and downe Within her chamber, she Beginneth in her minde to roull Of him the great bewty, And doth his state compare With Paris comly gle: And yet within her selfe she saies, Much fairer loe is he Then Narsissus so faire, Or mystus lo is he: And by and by, she thinkes fairer He is if there may be, Fairer then Narsissus Or Mystus that haue bene The fairest and the comliest wightes, That euer earst were seene. At last her father comes To see howe that she doe, With many a Lorde and lusty knight That come her grace vnto. Her father, he doth aske, If she her helth possesse: To whome she aunsweres by and by, For all his great richesse, She would not feell suche paine, As she not past eight daies Did feele ago, but to the Gods She gaue immortall prayse. Her father then doth ioye, And doth declare how that The noble knight Alfyne, is nowe Recouered of late Of his disease, and doth Sit up, and walkes about, And saith that Alfyne would lyue, Therof he had no doubte. Wherto she saies Amen, Though yet were there vnknowne The fame then of her health abroade, About the cities blowne. As sone as once the health Of her the people knowe, On aulters of the Goddes they all Their offringes bestowe. And bond fyers they doe make For ioye of this good chance: In euery streate they mery make, They singe, they leape, and daunce. And as the wight that is From death deliuered late, So ioyeth she and father eke, Oh thryse and happy fate. They all this daie therfore For holy doe suppose, And then their myndes to eleuate The hearmony they chose. The Phisition approched is Syr Alfynes house vnto, And vnto him his message then He ginneth for to doe. And then declares that she His comming would abide Within the court of Sylluma: Then takes he him aside, And vnto him doth giue The letter that he bare, Desyring lo an aunswere straight, For he to court would fare. To whome Alfyne doth tell, That he straightway would frame An aunswere and he should forthwith To her go beare the same. Then to his closet he Doth go, and penne doth take, And on this wyse the aunswere he Therof to her doth make. The aunswere to the letter of Pandauola. The Gods whom we accompt As iust and blest to be, Preserue thy life oh Lady deare The chiefest ioye to me, As to a captiue naught, Is ioye but libertie. Euen so likewyse, there nothing is More ioyfull vnto me, Then thus by your goodnes Although a captiue I, And as it were one rescued nowe, Once iudged for to die: And as for demyng lo, Unworthy I me fynde The least good gift of your good grace That you to me haue syn. I thinke those famous men That liued haue eare this, Could not deeme other, but that ye Are chiefest cause of blisse. Or els I deeme that they Would neuer vndertake Suche perilles, as full often they You to obtaine, doe make. Achilles champion stoute, What tyme in Troye he sawe Polyxena, he did desire To be the sonne in lawe Of Pyramus, that king Of Troye of renowne, Syr Parys eke the worthiest knight, That was in Illyon towne. His brother Hector saue To Grece his passage tooke: His Aunt the faire Exiona, Within their courtes to looke. But being taken with The fyry cleuing darte, Of Helena the Queene, whose syght Did strike him to the harte. That maugre all their heades, To shippe this dame he bare: And hoisyng vp his mery sailes, To Troye began to fare. So if that Cupide durste These champions stoute assayle, What boutyd them him to resiste, When naught they could preuayle. To striue against the streame, Is labour lost in vayne: The more he striues, the more increase His dolour and his payne. The noble Pyramus, Him selfe for Tysbe slew, Because he thought that he was cause Of breaking faith so trewe. Thus if these did as heare, Full oft we haue heard saye: Then maruell not oh Lady dear, Why that as quighte awaye, My senses all were fled. Sythe you doe passe them all, Then all the reste, it doth behoue That I should lower fall. And that you haue your health, I ioye therof to heare, The which I praie the Gods to holde Full many daies and yeare. If life or death you should Commaunde, I would obey: Be life or death, or what thing els, If that it please you say. And whyle that life this corps Should full inioye and haue: I am the knight that shall performe What thing your grace shall craue. And here I bynd me to Your grace, your man to be At all assaye without delay To doe that pleaseth ye, Thus here I take my leue, Desiring Gods to sende The wyshed ioyes that we desire, Our griefes to make an ende. This done, the letter he Unto the Doctor bringes, Desiring that the Doctor would Before all other thinges, Deliuer that his deede Unto her graces hande. The Phisition doth straight departe, He will no lenger stande With him to talke, but goes Awaye from him apace, And then within a whyle he is Ariued in the place Of Syluma the king, And forward straight doth goe Unto the faire Pandauola, His message for to showe. And coming in where as The Lordes a daunsing be, He makes a signe, the which thing lo, Perceiued soone had she: And from her place doth ryse, Taking him by the hande, Desiring him, that she might there His message vnderstande. The letter foorth he drawes And giues it her vnto, And saith that Alfyne is preste Her bidding for to doe. With that he goes awaye, And saieth then that he, At one time or an other, will Returne her grace to see. And now the pleasaunt dewe Of heauen beginnes to fall And eache man loe, his reste to take Perswadeth there withall. The syluer skye of hew The darkesome shades of night Doth couer cleane the sunne and daye Descended out of sight, And glistring starres do decke The pole of heauen so hie, And nature ginnes her rest to craue With heuy pensiue eye. Thus then Pandauola Her rest to take doth go, And wisheth that Alfyne her knight Weare there so none might knowe. She roules, she tournes, she tosse, With dreaming often, to One while she thinketh on their loue An other while to doe. Some prety feate so that They their desire may haue, An other whyle she counteth on Her honor for to saue. Thus on this wyse she spendes, And driues the night awaye, Untill such tyme as Phebus did His banner foorth displaye, With clearsome light aboue, Our Horisonte in east. And with his praunsing horse drewe foorth His chaire into the weste. Then Alfyne comes vnto The court of Sylewma, And enters into the chamber Of fayre Pandauola, Who when she sawe, then straight With stretched paulmes awid She giues the Gods most harty thankes, That so for her prouide. And then about his necke Her gentill armes she caste, With kissing swete, a thousand foulde She welcomes him at last. And there he doth abide With her his Lady bright, His life, his health, his ioye, his trust, And eke his hartes delight. Unto the king they go, And he in chamber is, Who for to welcome Alfyne, doth With frendly hart him kisse: And eke Pandauola: Whose kisses were more swete Then fathers were, Alfyne her knight Againe with kisse doth grete. Then downe to meate they go, For dinner drewe full nie, ioyfull So they consumde that ioyfull daie With pleasaunt hermony. But Alfyne and the mayde, (The dinner being done) Unto their chamber richely decte, To talke are thether gone. Thus haue they past the daye, And Alfyne sees that night Is come, for to departe as then, He sheweth that it is right. But lo Pandauola, This parting ill doth take, And doth desire him that he will As then his soiorne y make. But he desiring lo Paredon, doth her denie, (For those his wordes) and sayeth more, Her father he will trie, As concerning the thing That they haue greede upon, They take their leaue and Alfine he Unto his place is gone, The gliding starres perswades Eche thing vnto his reste And darkesome shades the pole of heauen Do compas to the west, And pleasaunt sleape doth creepe By stealth into their eies, In meane while the golden pole Of heauen about earth flies, And gilding starres doe fall, Then shone Aurora cleare, And Phebus bright with glistring beames, Unto vs he doth appeare. Then Alfyne doth arise, And to the king doth go, In purpose of the king the ende Of his intente to knowe, Who when he comes he gretes The king likewyse againe, Doth welcome him and geues him thankes, That he would take the paine As to come him to see, With that a knight full faire Came to the king and said, that he For this cause did repaire, To tell vnto his grace Some newes, wherby he might Some helpe forsee, for him and his, As due it was be tright. To whom the king commaund, That he without all shame Should tell his tale, and said that he Therfore should haue no blame. The knight then thus begonne, Oh king, the Christian knightes Inuade thy lande, and daily yet They worke vs more despights. The Spasyardes doe possesse Almost thy countrey rounde, And Hungarians doe like wise Thy people quight confounde, Helpe therefore nowe O king With spede we thee doe praye, Or els they quighte will ouerronne This land without delaye. For now from this same place They be but iourneyes small. Helpe nowe oh king, sith we as nowe For helpe to thee doe call. This saide, the king straght way Doth for his counsell call, The which doe come, and then they do Enter the counsell hall. When they were set, Alfyne Doth foorth his matter breake, But lo, the king doth him commaunde No woorde therof to speake. And thus he saide, syr knyght, You knowe the royall rase Of Pandauola, and she ought In suche a kinde of case For to be matcht with one Whose birth is somewhat like: Therfore syr Alfyne wey this well, And yours is farre to seke. Therfore your selfe content, For I doe tell you plaine, She shall not yet be maried, Yet muse I more againe, Sithe that you being but A Duke of lynage poore, Should seme to craue in mariage So ryche and fayre a flowre. When as syr Flaccus, who Is next me in this lande, Will not presume her for to craue: Therfore thus it shall stande, That when a time shall come Better we will prouide For her then so, therfore (quoth he) Set this your talke aside. And then he doth declare The fine of this intent, As concerning the warres in hand, And this was their iudgement: That Syluma him selfe, An army great should make, And shall descende in battell and Should Alfyne with him take. So thus they haue agreed, And there the counsell brake, And Alfyne he doth from the king His iourney forthwith take Unto the chamber of The daughter of the king, And vnto her recounteth all Of euery kinde of thyng That hath bene saide or done, Within the chamber lo. She vnderstandeth euery white, Alfyne then thence doth go With heuy cheare and then Pandauola doth wayle, And afterwards her maydes she calles With them for to counsaile Wherof one Palyne, Suche one as she may truste She calles to her, and so her mynde At last she hath discuste From point to point, and then For counsell she doth craue, To whome Palyne aunswered, This sorte (quoth she) I haue Oh noble Lady deare, Byne trusted nowe ear this About suche cures, wherfore I hope That nowe I shall not misse, But will you ease certaine, Of good chere therefore be, And for a tyme let fortune woorke, The ende your grace shall see To be profitable, When he at warres hath bene, We can not tell but happely May chaunce some kinde of thing, Or iust deserte of his Upon our enemies tride, That may vnto this euill chaunce Some better waye prouide. Therfore my counsell is, That he with willing mynde Shall doe the thing what that it be To him that is a synde. Therby full soone he may Obtaine your fathers grace To be his friende, more faithfull then He nowe is in this case. And when some noble feate He shall haue complishd so, A daily friende the king will be To him, this well you knowe. Then may he seme to craue, And also iustly may You, to obtaine be the bolder Your father for to praye. Therfore my counsell is, That you with spede and might Shall him perswade for to be stoute According vnto right, Your fathers foes to quell And true subiect to be, Regarding not your fathers woordes, But his faith and dutie. The daye is come, and they Their armies great haue chose, And Alfyne with his armie, he Unto the Palayse goes Of Syluma the king, And mousters him before With colour pale and angry harte, Much like vnto a Bore. He castes his holowe eyes Now here, now there about, With frothing lips his dedly thoughtes With colour black flye out. The king the mouster sees, For Alfyne he doth sende, And doth c?maunde that he forthwith Unto the fielde do wende, The Christians they prepare Defence with spede to make, And Alfyne he beginnes forthwith Thether his waye to take. The armie of the king Is ready in this tide, The which to Flaccus he committes Unto the fielde to guyde, But yet before they go, Alfyne his leaue doth take Of Pandauola bright and shene, His loue, his deare, his mate, To whome she on this sorte Began her tale to tell, (Quoth she) O Alfyne this my deare, You know full sure and well, That when by prowes great Some thing you shall achiefe, Then bouldly may you aske i wys Me for to be your wife. Therfore my counsell is All rancor layde asyde, That you my fathers heastes to doe With spede shall runne and ryde. Neither that you should take Suche griefe, of that he saide, Be of good chere, fortune hath now Her worste at first displayde. Then rounde about his necke Her gentell armes she caste With teares she brwes her g?til chekes And takes her leue at last. Now Alfyne and the king Unto the army goes, The king the conduct of the warre Nowe vnto Alfyne shoes, And him exhortes to striue Victorie to obtaine, And then he sayes in end he shall Him well rewarde for paine This wordes to Alfyne gaue Some hope his praye to wynne, For ioye whereof his heauy harte Reioyseth now within. The Sunne hath entryd now The waues that shine so bright And Luna spreades her beames abroade, Now procheth on the night. The king and Alfyne they Unto the campe are come, Before the waues haue couered The golden shining Sunne. The Souldiers busy be Their campe to fortifie, Some go to reste, the glistring starres Fulfilling all the skie. The night is gone and all, The armie plaine Apeares: Then all the Christians foorthwith Their standardes tall vpreares. The Turke is nothing slowe The Christians to mete, With chrayshing swoordes, the other they With lusty bloes do grete Upon the name of Christe Full loude the Christians call, The Turkes vnto their Mahomet With prayer ginnes to fall. The Turkes haue lost that daye, Of men a nomber great, But yet for that they do not seace, The Christians heads to beate. The gonstones through the ayre With dolefull voyce doe crie, And fautall arrowes through the cloud Into eche armie flie. And here in fleshe it lightes, And geues a deadly wounde: And in an other parte there is A thousand brought to grounde. The battaile standes in doubt, At last the Christians, they Haue wonne the fielde, the Turkes apase From thence doe flie awaye. Thus pleased God to graunte The victorie as then By force so gotte, end for to fall Unto the Christen men. The night departed hath The armies for that tide, And misty cloudes eche others campe Asunder doth deuide. When that the daie was come, And Phebus shone full bright, The Turke beginnes to incourage His souldiers for to fight. And thus to them he saies With cruell angry cheare: As by the wordes that he did speake, May very well appeare. Oh catiues quight undone, You traytours to your king: You enemies to Mahomet, What got you by flying. This other daie nowe paste Before your enemies hande, And for your cowardnes durst not Before their swordes to stande. Why should not they possesse That earst our fathers wanne, And why, haue they not quite destroide Of vs both childe and man? What could their force withstande When you began to flie. Thinke you that stones for our quarel With them would seme to trie. The honour of our name, Through you is gone and lost The fame of oure olde aunceters Is topsy touruy toste By Mahomete quoth he) Nothing doth make me muse, That then to spoyle our tentes also, The Christians did refuse, But that I thinke some god Our ruen did perpende And therfore would not suffer them Their fury to extende. With that he paused awhyle, His souldiers full bould Did giue a showte as heau? and earth As then together would The whiche he marked well, My thinkes (quoth he) I see The hartes and willes of men which woulde Not so accompted be, But that they would reuenge Their shame committed so They crie, desiring of the king That they to fielde may go, And then he should perceiue Their hartes and willes the more, How they would reuenge the iniurie Done so the daie before. Then saide the king, sithe that Amendes you tende to make, I am content forthwith the fielde Against our foes to take. Then to the fielde he goes With all his Turkishe trayne: The Christians forthwith also Descende vnto the playne, The battaile then beginnes Full fiers on ether side. The Christians striue the bodies of The Turkes for to deuide. But Alfyne he doth so With sworde the Christians checke, That some he makes lower to be By head and eke the necke. Then when the Christian kynges On that sorte so beholde. Euen with a winge of horsemen they Syr Alfyne doe infolde. There they him prisoner take And led him to their tent, The Turkes y? while to win the felde Or els to die are bent. Thus standes it all the daye The Christians are full faine For to retire they hauing so Almost their armie slaine. Then Syleuma the king Unto their tentes doth go, And by and by, a messenger Comes and to him doth showe, Howe that the noble Duke Syr Alfyne him doth praye, In all the haste that eare he came, His raunsome he will paye, And also this beside, The Christians require To haue a peace confirmde of him, For the space of three yeare. When nues did come to him That Alfyne did abide With the Christians as prysoner, He calles his Lordes asyde. And asked them what they Would counsell him to doe: To whom syr Flaccus answered That sithe it came so to Passe, as he looked for, He thought it best, that he Should as a prisoner with those Of Christendome still be, For he that would your grace To them haue deliuere, In my iudgement he ought not now So to be raunsomed. But for the peace he saide, He thought it good to be Concluded vpon for so small time, As farre as he could see. And lastly ye shall fynde Full well (quoth he) I knowe, That he for a litle or naught Againe shall be let go. That I haue saide (quoth he) I will proue it to ende, Therfore (quoth he) oh king you may If please you answere sende Unto the Christians, that Sithe that they peace doe craue, You are content that for three yeares, A peace that they shall haue. The counsell all doe like This Flaccus counsell so That thereupon they doe agree Before the truthe they knowe. The messenger they call His message to receiue: Who hath the peace graunted to him, And so they take their leaue. But as for Alfyne, he Should not his raunsome haue, And with this floute he bad that they That iuell riche should saue. The messenger is gone The Christen kinges vnto: When he was come, he thus at last His message gan to doe. The kinges and Lordes once set, His tale he thus began: (Quoth he) I haue most royall Lordes As farre forth as I can Requested of the king A peace for three yeares space, The whiche he hath graunted to vs, But yet thus saith his grace, That as for Alfyne he Sall still your prisoner be. And this condicion that You all his lande must leaue Within eight monethes vpon this same Your peace ye must receiue: This message being done, They straight them sport and playe With ioye and myrth, and some of them To Alfyne take their waye, Who mourning ginnes to wayle, And thus at last he saide. And hath my Lege denied me My raunsome to be payde, I some time was a Prince, But now a captiue vile, A slaue, a drudge, a beaste, no man, But drouen to exile. Oh would (quoth he) to God My Lady fayre and bright, Did knowe my case how my true hart Hath brought me this despight. Oh Sylewma (quoth he) Haue I so trusty bene To thee and thine, and yet by me Thou settest not a pinne. These Christian knightes I know, Would haue sone raunsomed me If theirs I were and had bene tooke Of thee mine enemy. Muche gentlier be these knightes Unto me, I doe fynde, Then thou oh Tyraunt fierse and fell Unto me in this kinde, Wherfore I praie the Goddes Some good lucke then to sende. That once they may of thee and me, Both see some euill ende: Fare well my Lady deare Pandauola the fayre, That art to Sylewma the king, His daughter and his ayre: Fare well I saye, for now Thou shalt some other haue. And Flaccus now myne enemy, May boldly seeme to craue Thee of thy father now, I can not him withholde, For lo, the king doth not esteme Me worth a strawe of golde. Oh knightes, alfyne beholde For Ladies bright and shene That wonted was with you to iuste With speres both sharpe and kend Lo, now in chaines he lies Fast bounde, both foote and hande: Oh Pandauola that for thee With Flaccus oft did stande. But thus why doe I wayle, Come death and ende my dayes, Sythe that vyle wretche I can not be Relieued, by no wayse. But yet would God my harte She might inioye and haue Before my corps intumyld were Or put into the graue. This saide, he wepes and wayles, And so his talke did ende, The whiche the Christian kinges haue heard And for him straight did sende. The king of Spaine doth rewe, The king of Hungary Doth also wepe to heare how he Lamentes his destenie, At last Alfyne is come Before them, and they all Of him inquier what he would doe, If so it might befall, That if so be at libertie As then that he should wende, Wherto he aunswered, that this As then he did intende That is, he neuer would Take sworde in hand to fight Against the Christians, but that he With all his power and might Would them defende he saide. Wheron they doe agree, That without any raunsome he Forthwith shall losid be To go where that he please, Or els there to abide. They gaue him eke a lusty steade To Uardam for to ryde. Where after foure monethes space Unto the court he came Of Syleuma which then was held Within the towne Uardam, But when he would haue prochte Syleumase court vnto, He was forbode by the porter So on that sorte to doe. Wherfore he doth departe Unto his mansion place, To whome a messenger doth come From old Syleumas grace. With this message in hande, That he his house should holde Untill he knewe farther, and not Once for to be so bolde As once abrode to go From that his house certaine. The messenger doth then departe Unto the king againe, And Alfyne he this while As the rewarde of payne, Unto the Christian Kinges hath sent Twelue cartes lodid with graine, Which thing when Flaccus knew, He forward straight doth goe To Syluma the king, and he Therof his grace doth showe. Then Syleuma doth sende His messenger to areste Syr Alfyne, of such treason as Before it is exprest. The messenger hath done He was commaunded to do, The officers syr Alfyne bringes King Syleuma vnto. Who when he comes, then straight The king to iudgement goes, And Flaccus he doth enter in And the accusement showes, Whiche Alfyne doth denie: But Flaccus doth desire According to the lawe of armes, To trie it with his speare. Wherto the king doth graunt, The our of fight is set: And now the Lordes and Ladies do About their places get, The houre being come, The king with all his trayne, Are come and take their place In middest vpon the playne. Then Flaccus commeth in, The king once being set, And then the Harrauldes are c?ma?de Alfyne to fielde to fette: Pandauola she sittes Hard by her fathers side, The Harauldes are come, and Alfyne Into the fielde doth ryde To Syluma the king: Flaccus doth come also, And there the accusation Againe Flaccus doth showe, For proufe wherof he is Contented for to trie The combate, but Alfyne Syr Flaccus wordes deny, And saieth that he will According vnto right, Proue y? he hath spoke al these wordes Of falshod and despight. The Harraulde then beginne Therof to make the crie, With speare in hand like lusty knights They runne immediatly, When speares were broke, they then Vnto their swordes them take And laiyng on such lode, they teache A medicine for head ake. Suche bloues Alfyne doth deale As he that had bene there Would not haue thought, that Flaccus shold So many bloues haue beare. But lo as thinges are set So oftentimes they fall, Their swordes are broke, and they For other swordes doe call, The which when that they haue, With courage bould and stoute, The manly knightes vnequall macht, Doe lay them rounde about, But Flaccus to Alfyne Hath such a blowe him lent, That maugre all his force, to grounde He Alfyne downe hath sent: But Alfine being quicke, He getteth vp againe, And such a blowe Flaccus he lent, That Flaccus he hath slaine. Which when the king behelde With heauy dolefull cheare, He parted thence, much like a man Full mad he did appeare. Then Alfyne did commaunde His body to be drawne Throughout the citie round about According to the lawe. Then Alfyne to the court Of Syleuma doth come, And Pandauola in her armes Her Alfyne hath up num And kisseth him full ofte, With geuing thankes certaine Unto her God, that so Alfyne His enemy hath slaine. The king with ier possest, No lenger can abyde, But drawes his fatall blade, and it In Alfynes throte doth hyde. Whiche when his daughter sawe That murdring cruell dede, She tooke him vp, and euen then She to her father yede, Desiring him that she, For all his raging spytes Might geue the body of buriyng, The solome kinde of rightes. To which thing he doth graunte, But saies, she shall not be At the buriall, but she should stande Where as she might it see. So straight a fyer great Under the toure was made Where she did stande, and Alfyne Into the fyer was layde. When she behelde this corps, Alfyne she loude doth call, And sodainly from of the toure She flong her selfe withall, Disdaining lo that so Her father did presume. And there in fyer two louers Did quight and cleane consume. The Ladies they runne in Her father for to tell Who when he harde of his daughter What mischiefe had befell: Upon his fatall sworde, He fell and so was slayne, Not leauing any issue there As king for to remayne. Finis. quoth J. Pertridge. To Thomas Baynam his friende, John P. wysheth health. Amicus est quasi alter idem. Vnworthy is that wight A benefite in deede, Which will not once requite A gift that did proceede From such a one whose will Indeuour and intent, To pleasure him in very deede, From time to time was bent. But like a crabid churle againe Naught wayeng that they payde But for thy gentilnes foreshoude Requites it with disdaine. As is the prouerbe olde, Wherfore least I should be Acoumpted as vngratefull nowe To such a frende as ye; I haue this story brought Unto our vulgar speche To pleasure you, wherfore accept The same, I you beseche. And as a recompence Though that the gift be small, Yet doe accept the louing hart The giuer giues withall. Finis. De amore inter Amicos. As loue is chiefest thing That common is to all, So faithfulnes is rariste thing That to louers doth fall. For many frendes there be In outwarde kinde of showe, But faithfull friendes as wyse men saye There is a very fewe, Suche friendes I meane, as will Not hault with hound nor hare But for the profite of his friend, Nor friend ne foe will spare. Nor he who heate nor colde, Ne tempest, wynde, nor rayne, Can cause to flie but in all stormes Still constant doth remaine. Such one a Juell is, Excelling golde and fee: And he is riche that hath a friende So sure a one as he. The gredy yauning iause Of vipers flattring taile Do what they c?, against such friendes Can naught at all preuaile. In blanditia adulatorum. As he is blest in deede That hath a trusty friende, So contrary is he on whome Flatterers doe much intende. For as the trusty friende No paine can call awaye, Euen so doe flatterers flie apase When that no more they may Obteine that they desire, But in his paine and griefe They do him leaue wh? their fr?dship Of ioyse should be the chiefe. But as the Scorpion doth As those that trye doe knowe No hurt at all, so long as you In quiet let them go. But when she once shall feele You, to disturbe her ease Neuer so smal then straight she seekes Againe you to displease: By pouring out of her Her poysoned styng, wherby She stynges so sore, that out of hande The party stong shall die, Unlesse that the selfe same That stong him so before Be slayne, his health againe He cannot get no more. And yet it standes in doubte Though that the same they get, If that the Scorpion to the hart The poyson so hath set. Hermes, a flattring man Doth lyken well certaine Unto a Camell, which saue white, All colours doth retaine. And as he wantes the same, So like wyse may we see A flatterer, all pointes to haue Saue only honestie. No dagger strikes more depe, Nor Uiper poysones so As doth the flattring parasite, A swete destroiyng to. Therfore if you be wyse, Learne to escewe the snare Of flatterers, or els perhaps They make your purse full bare. And warning take by him That therof feeles the payne If you be wyse, and from such men Your footesteps do you frame. Finis. quoth J. Par.</field>
