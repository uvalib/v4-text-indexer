      <field name="fulltext">The Waves and the War. I. The Baltic Fleet. He would not let them rest On the waters of the West, Where they slumbered in their baysâthose sons of England's mightâ With their great white shadowy shrouds Folded calm as brooding clouds, Dreaming of old victories in the drowsy summer-light. He would not let them rest, Those war-ships of the West, The Czar of sullen Muscovy in drunkenness of pride; And they gather now and throng, The beautiful and strong, Like a fairy pageant floating for a pastime on the tide. They toy and they play With the waters on their way; They tack and they veer, as if in sport upon the sea; But evermore they write In those furrows creamy-white, Our messages of ruin to thine empire and to thee. The gentle ocean laughed To the countless pleasure-craft, That with music and with joyousness came dancing in delight; And, as though 'twere a caress, Round the mighty ships they press, As you cheer a gallant charger ere it rushes to the fight. But a sudden change was wrought, For the mass a signal caught, And feverish expectation hung lead-like on each breath; Deep silence sank around, And the crowds stood wonder-bound, Till they scarcely felt the ocean pulsing heavily beneath. Then o'er those myriads mute Slow rolled the last salute; A white cloud started upward, hiding ships, and sea, and sky; And a thunder ebbed away Over inland, shore and bay, Forth flinging to the universe a nation's battle cry. The far hills throb around With the wide o'erwhelming sound; The waves are prostrate laid, like a solid glassy floor, Then they crisp again and rear, With pale foam, white as fear, And shivering, in long moaning lines creep slowly to the shore. The thin cloud disappears In a shower of sudden tearsâ Or is it angels weeping o'er the thought of coming woes?â And a prophet-hue of blood Flits flickering o'er the flood, And a sobbing and a sighing is heard around the bows. Then each one held his breath, For he knew the voice of death; A sense of solemn sorrow sank hushing far and wide; And a vision dim of graves 'Mid lonely shores and waves, And silent, hopeless evenings by a desolate fireside. But the graceful sails arose Like a drift of mountain-snows, And the steam-ship, like a war-horse, came trampling down the brine; And hearts again beat fast To see them as they passedâ The cavalry of ocean and the slow-paced sailing line. 'Twas thus we bade them go To seek our country's foe; Not in doubting or in fearing did the nation send them forth; 'Twas a people's holiday To greet their brave array, And a sound of joyous cheering went behind them to the North. II. The Baltic. There's a gateway vast in the northern seas, Its piers are the rocks of granite, Its rampart bold is the mountain old, With the storms of heaven to man it. Behind that ancient gateway high, The waves of the North Sea breasting, The Danish Isles on the Baltic lie, Like knights on their blue shields resting. And all within through a circle wide The azure tides are sleeping; A gallant field for a tournay's pride, Where monarchs the lists are keeping. The mountains hoar on the girdling land, That rise in their vast gradations, The mighty seats of that theatre grand, Are crowded with watching nations. The Heralds that open and close the lists, Are the cloudy children of heaven: They come in the spring in a robe of mists, In cars by the West Wind driven. In a crystal grave is buried the wave, In a pall of white snow folden; The great ships rest on its heaveless breast, By the hand of winter holden: But so loud a blast those Heralds cast To the billows beneath them lying, They rise like the dead from their icy bed, To the voice of their God replying. The avalanche falls from the distant hill; The tomb of the sea is broken; The great ships bound and the white sails fill: 'Tis thus that the lists they open. But when the battle is doomed to cease, And the sun to the south is clinging, The East Wind comes like the Herald of Peace, The angels of Mercy bringing. He comes with the delicate spirits of air That sit in the North's clear portals, And weave, from the dew and the starlight fair, The tissue called snow by mortals. On threads of invisible frost they glide, Their fairy footfalls beaming In thin white flakes, like the light that breaks From the moon at morning gleaming. The boldest pirate that ploughs the brine With red hand reeking from slaughter, Flies, when he sees that gentle sign Come stealing over the water. The bursting fire and the red ball's ire The strongest of walls may shatter; But the flakes of snow those spirits throw His navies like dry leaves scatter. The war's red rack and the battery black, With ghastly trophies laden, Their passage light leaves pure and white As the thought of a spotless maiden. All night they sit on the helm and prow, Calling the North Light nigher; Rocking the great ship to and fro, And stilling its heart of fire. Their cold thin fingers of hoar-frost sere On the cannon's black lip laying: 'Tis hushed!âand the morn sees a trembling tear Where the fires of death were playing. 'Tis thus the East Wind comes in the night, God's truce in his white flag waving, The pride of the conqueror putting to flight, But the wreck of the conquered saving. O'er the desolate slain his wreath is cast, Of Death's pale winter-roses: For a Herald of Peace the East Wind passed: 'Tis thus that the lists he closes. III. The Arrival. On the Baltic deep the sun went down, And reddened its sounding floor, And the shadows came like a gathering frown From the hills of the Swedish shore. The plains of Muscovy far away Grew pale with a ghastly white; On the Western lands was the light of day, But over the East was night. And where the twilight and golden gleam Commingle, a mighty shapeâ Still as a shadow, dim as a dreamâ Comes gliding around the cape. Another yet, and in long array The ships of the Sea-Queen sweep, As though the mountains, loosed from the bay, Floated out on the open deep. The touch of a child can stay their course, Yet nought can their might withstand,â Type of a wise free people's force, So docile, and yet so grand. They swayed with the lightest wave that broke, They swung at the slightest breath; Yet an empire's heart's in their ribs of oak, And the strength of the Titan, Death! To the coast of Muscovy slow they stood, Where ocean and sky combine; And as clouds with storms of the morrow brood, Settle down in a long dark line. Oh! then was a stir in that region vast,â A noise of a realm's affright; And the millions dull, 'neath a level cast, Clamoured up in their soulless night. Do they dream of a day that in glory comes? Of a morn that is mounting higher, When Freedom speaks through the roll of drums, And walks in a shroud of fire? On Muscovy's plains the sun shall rise And herald a day more bright: They are but dark with a curse that dies, And shall wake to a deathless light. For knowledge sublime from the West shall come, As it came from the East of yore; A child that brought pearls of great price from home, Returning to render back more. IV The Words of the West. I fight for the rights of the free, said the West, I fight for the rights of the free; And I come from the lands that Peace loves best, And the sovereign Isles of the Sea; From the isles that rest On the blue wave's breast, Like thrones for the Queen of the Sea. I fight not for kingdoms or gold, said the West, Not for riches, dominion, or might; But for what is worth more to the manly breast,â For the triumph of human right; And the fetters to wrest from the weak and oppressed, And the tyrant of nations to smite. 'Tis true that I covet in peace to bide, And shudder at carnage and strife, And value more highly than all earth's pride The blood of one human life: In my strength's calm reliance I blazoned it wide, And you thought I was panic-rife. 'Tis true that I barter, and sell, and buy, And that war is prosperity's grave; Yet because I am wealthy, no craven am I, Nor fettered as Mammon's slave; And my blood is as warm and my heart as high As that of the blustering knave. 'Tis true that I trusted the word you passed, And reposed on your base guarantee, And that I slowly treated while you armed fast, For I thought you had honour like me; But hope not to baffle and cheat me at last, Tho' crafty as Satan you be. 'Tis true that your cunning, our councils to mar, Its mean royal sycophants sends; That foes are amidst us as well as afar, And the worst are the seeming friends, Who would turn the tide of a nation's war To their own petty selfish ends. But they yet shall learn there's a manly sense In the midst of my Western land, That dynasties are but an idle pretence When in Liberty's way they stand, And that rights of nations are not bartered hence With a young lady's delicate hand. There is metal yet of the selfsame ore That the sword of a Sydney made; There are hearts that are sound to the inmost core, Uncankered by traffic and trade; And the world shall find I can rise once more, And strike in the new crusade. For I fight for the rights of the free, said the West, Nor for riches, dominion, or might; But for what is worth more to the manly breast, For the triumph of human right; And the fetters to wrest From the weak and oppressed, And the tyrant of nations to smite. V. The Emperor's Vigil. At Cronstadt in his granite palace Walked the despot to and fro; Gazing through the seaward windows, Asking tidings of the foe. Redly had the sun descended On the sea-line cold and clear; Barren wastes of tumbling waters Spread before him far and near. Trembling commerce fled their surface; Not a war-ship rode the sea; And the despot prayed in secret, âMay it long as desert be!â Little clouds, a hand in bigness, Mount the limit of the sight: âSee ye not yon specks in distance âFleck the evening's line of light?â âSire! 'tis but the sea-mist drivingâ â'Tis the grey gulls' airy trainââ âSigns like those, in stormy climates, âMarch before the hurricane!â But the twilight swiftly thickens, Sweeps the horizon from the view, And, with deep foreboding voices, Boom the tides the darkness through. âBlot the sea-marks from our harbours! âQuench the beacon's guiding light! âPile the granite mountains round us! âShroud usâcover us with night!â Glowing stars, with sudden lustre, Leap from out the black expanse: Thick the ships of England muster! Fast the signal-rockets glance! Start from unexpected places Through the darkness still and cold; And, with large bright sunny faces, Look into the despot's hold. Backward, to his inmost chamber, Turns the monarch from the sight; Conjures dreams of pomp and greatness, Visions of imperial might. But the heavy guns come rockingâ Rocking roof, and wall, and floor, Like hands of retribution knockingâ Knocking at his empire's door. And the despot, fever-driven, Climbs the watch-tower's topmost height, Gazes o'er his darkened heaven, Seeks a solace from the night. Silent, Cronstadt lay below him, With its arsenals of death; Silent, crouched his boasted navy, Stifling hard its steamy breath. E'en the foe's proud war-ships slumbered Night's funereal watches through; Things of dread, whose unseen presence Magnifying terror knew. Here and there alone, the lantern Landward gleamed with swerveless ray, Like the eye of some huge monster Watching steadily its prey. But the monarch turneth eastward, And in sullen triumph smiles: There his empire stretches boundless, Boundless through unnumbered miles. There they lie, the fettered millions! Wrapt in feverish slumber dim, Dreaming, 'neath night's dark pavilions, Of a darker morn for him! Boding sounds of sorrowing nations Seem around that tower to meet, And with sighs and lamentations Break like surges at his feet. Ghostly voices moan around him; Strength for flight he may not find: Half a century's years have bound him As the chains a culprit bind. From that watchtower's lonely summit Dives his thought on every side: Never heart of king shall fathom Secrets of that human tide! âFoes may fret my western borders, âFoes may chafe my southern length: âPast their utmost efforts, eastwardâ âEastward lies my hope and strength. âWhat shall shake the lord of Nations, âWhom unnumbered slaves obey; âCountless myriads blindly hast'ning âTo uphold my boundless sway?â Straightâthe wide horizon's lifted Past the ken of mortal sight: Pale Siberia, Freedom's graveyard, Lies distinct in livid light. Are its stony mountains crumbling? Do its solid plains arise? What vast rack of pallid vapour Comes up-steaming on the skies? Ha! they mount from mine and dungeon! Ha! they break from shroud and chain! All the heroes he has murdered All the martyrs he has slain. Trampling up the murky zenith, Still they climb the horizon's rim, All their shadowy footsteps speeding Over half the world to him. And a voice before them goeth, Wailing like a freezing wind: âEvery one of us, the martyred, âLeft a bleeding heart behind. âEvery home of dear ones rifled, âIs an arsenal of hate; âEvery pulse thy hand has stifled, âShall come knocking at thy gate. âSend the henchmen through thy confines âOn sedition's dim-seen track: âOurs the shadowy steps they followâ âBaffled they shall wander back! âWhile behind them, ever higher, âRises Revolution's tide: âEven now the steps it touches âOf thy throne's imperial pride. âBlood can never purchase safety; âTyrant's work is vainly done: âHe, who slays a single foeman, âMakes a hundred for the one. âIn Siberia far we perished, âBut in Russia still we live! âThis the hope thine East has cherished, âThis the solace that we give.â Hush! he hears their thrilling whisper! See! he knows their icy breath! Impalpable as air they gather, But immense and real as Death. âSave me! blot those horrid phantoms! âCraven thought's fantastic liesâ âOh! thou longed-for South! Support me âWith one glory from thy skies! âThou, Stamboul! the radiant daughter âOf the Loves of East and West, âLet me grasp thee but in vision, âSoon to clasp thee to my breast!â Straightâthe wide horizon's lifted Past the ken of mortal sight: But 'tis not Stamboul he seeth Slumbering fair in living light. Dark before him towers the Balkan, Tier on tier in solemn ranks; Angry flashes, red and sullen, Breaking off its gloomy flanks. Far away, in icy armour, Caucasus gigantic stands, With the deluge at his footsteps, And the lightning in his hands. And between them, and before them, Comes a world in arms arrayed, Striding through that vast arena O'er a grave a tyrant made. Hark! from nation on to nation, Loud the calls to battle run: âPeoples were not formed for tyrants! âMillions were not made for one! âArm ye! arm ye! Slave and Bondsman! âThrall and Exile! homeward turn! âSee! the flag of Freedom's lifted, âLo! the flames of vengeance burn! âWhat if monarchs will not help us? âSelf-reliance arms the least! âKings! the battle now beginning âStays not, ends not in the East.â And from Europe's farthest corners, Diving up the spectral sky, Pale, reproachful, sorrowing faces Rise, and gaze at him, and sigh! âUs a sceptred bravo murdered: âUs a tyrant mean laid low: âBut from thee he gained the courageâ âHis the dagger, thine the blow. âWhere'er heroes' ashes smouldered, âWhere'er honour's hope grew bright, âThere thine icy hand destroying âMight be felt amid the night. âKing! thy glory hath departed, âDark we close thy dying day.â Thus the sorrowful dim visions Gaze, and sigh, and sink away. Wondering stands the hope of monarchs, Stands the God of knouts and chains; He who made the world a graveyard, And then boasted: âOrder reigns!â On, thro' every trampled nation, Wide the cry of vengeance ran, Where his step of desolation Had defiled the homes of man. From Silistria's gory passes First the dreadful accents fell, And Dobrudscha's death-morasses Wailing caught the passing knell. Pale Stamboul exhausted answers From each fading minaret, Like the weak wind's low lamenting When the suns of summer set. Slow, the sea-commanding Kingdom Stirs its drowsy members vast; But a voice from Seine's bright waters Rings as clear as clarion blast: âOnce we entered Moscow's ramparts, âTwice in Paris' walls we met: âOne such visit still we owe thee, âCossack! take the bloody debt!â Through Sardinia's mountain girdle Echo stirs in every cave; E'en the Arab leaves the desert, And the Bedouin breasts the wave. Egypt peals a shout of triumph Into Afric's heart away; Memnon sings a song of battle To the dawn of freedom's day. Sunny plains of Anatolia Onward still the burthen bear, Dense as leaves of autumn rustling Through its chestnut-forests fair. O'er the Persian's sultry borders Low the cry portentous hies, With the sound intense, when thunder Faint upon the desert lies. Over Asia's central ranges Far the wandering echoes fall, And Cathay, remotely listening, Sighs behind its mouldering wall. Sad Sinope's silenced harbour Hears beside its funeral mound, And Circassia's granite temple Backward flings the solemn sound; Till the fast returning echoes All their gathering vengeance roll, Bursting in one mighty thunder At thy gate, Sebastopol! Ha! the despot's prophet-vision Sees its ramparts crumbling fall, And the rush of foemen storming Up its earthquake-shattered wall; Sees his ships, the cruel boasters, Sink beneath the inglorious tide, Sinkâwithout defeat's last honourâ Russia's ocean-suicide: Still he proudly stands defiant, Back his haughty challenge flings: âOnce before ye sought to quell meâ âTilt against mine armour, Kings! âSome there are who dare not strike meâ âSome who will but strike me halfâ âThough my conquered hosts lie bleeding, âSafe behind them still I laugh!â What portentous change is passing O'er the battle's order far? âWho are these with brows of glory, âCharging through the ranks of war? âWhat new host sublime advances, âWhat old flags are waving wide?â Hungary! Hungary lifts her lancesâ Poland rushes to her side! âAll too long, and now no longer, âWait we for a foreign might; âKings are strong, but Peoples stronger âWith the wisdom to unite.â âHave I not yet slain thee, Poland! âArt thou rising from thy grave?â Tyrant, nations are immortalâ Nothing dieth but a slave. Freedom's banner waving o'er them, On their conquering legions pass: Wide thine armies fly before them, Down thy ramparts fall like glass. âThou! whom once I saved in peril, âHaste to help me! Austria! rise.â Vain! the hoary-headed sinner Gasps forth âItaly!ââand dies. âThou! once prostrate at my footstool, âPrussia! arm thy filial band!â Vain! the dastard knave unblushing Spurns his fall'n protector's hand. Without honour to defend him, Without courage to oppose, Cringes, till he sees him conquered, Then triumphant joins his foes. Eased in brain by wordy vapour, Strikes his hollow heartless breast, Claims his share for doing nothing, Cries, âWe did it!ââwith the rest. Then the monarch's brow grew lofty With a brave imperial pride: Even Tyranny looks noble, Seen by such poor Treason's side. âType of ancient rule, I battledâ âModern thoughts and forms prevail;â âFoiled alone by heroes banded, âCravens shall not see me quail. âDown the old world sinks beneath me, âAnd the new world shineth forth: âHas the Russians' God forsaken? âHast thou not a word, O North!â Then the North Light flamed in heaven, And the North Star paler grew; And there passed an awful whisper Snowy wastes and pine-woods through. Fear o'ercame the mighty monarch, For he felt that fatal breath, E'en through India's torrid noontide Chills the bounding blood with death. 'Twas the North God's dooming answer! Trembling Love and Science brave, Those who once have heard that summons, Vainlyâvainly strive to save! Passed the vigil of the midnight, Rose the broad sun's busy hour; Courtiers still cryââLive for ever! âEarth-God! who shall stay thy power?â Some few days he walked among them, Hushed beneath unwonted awe: Those around him wildering wondered At the solemn change they saw. Then the Czar went forth at morning, Mustered calm his legioned pride, Heard Death whisper through his clarions, Bowed his lofty head, and died. VI. The Sailor's Night Watch What steals upon the midnight? What walks across the wave, Where the moon's long light-path stretches o'er The sailor's sullen grave, Like a bridge that is built by angels, The sinking soul to save? One end on the ship-side resteth, And one is held afarâ Farâfar in the lands of heaven and home, By the hand of the Evening Star: And my thoughts travel over and linger Where those that I love so are! And then, in the stilly midnight, Sweet forms come tripping o'er, For I see at the end of that ray of light My home on a pleasant shore, And my dear one lonely and sad within, And my child at the cottage-door. Their eyes are turned towards me, And I beckon them to my side; I beckon them up with the pulse of my heart, And they come o'er the ocean wide, On that delicate path that the angels made For the feet of my sorrowing bride. And she sitteth here beside me, And she telleth of love and home, And she placeth her hand in mine, with a touch As light as the milky foam: I dare not look, but I know she is there, And my thoughts to their haven roam. And such words she whispers to me, Through mine inmost soul they flow: âThey will ask me at home if my love was brave, âThey will look in my face to know: âWhile I cry to Heaven; âOh, spare us, Lord! ââAs he spareth the prostrate foe.ââ The wave rolls over the seaâ The cloud glides over the skyâ And the spell-bound vision of beauty and love Breaksâbreaks with a sudden sigh; But bless'd be that watch of the midnight, That lifted my heart more high. VII. The Return. We returnâbut not down-hearted; Not a warrior vails his brow: Proud and joyous we departed, And as proud return we now. Do you ask for our achievementsâ What the cities we laid low? Greater 'tis to save a kinsman, Greater than to smite a foe. And your eyes, to mete our service, Need not wander o'er the flood: See in Englandânot in Russiaâ What we did for England's good. England's shores were in our keeping, England's commerce in our trust: Are your widowed mothers weeping? Are your stately mansions dust? Have your coasts, from Wight to Orkney, Seen a single foeman's sailâ Save the captives that we sent ye To adorn your triumph's tale? On your seaboard commerce tarries, And along its virgin coast Still your great unrivalled cities Their unchallenged grandeur boast. Not for useless cruel slaughter England sent her warriors forth; But to keep the world's peace-breaker Captive in his sullen North. Captive in his own dominion Did we hold him at our will; At his prison bars he struggled, But he lies there captive still! Safe with us was England's honourâ Safe we bring it back again: Never once the foeman's navy Faced the mistress of the main. Though to woo him to the battle, Half our ships we sent away, And before him, twice our number, Two long weeks our challenge lay. On his ramparts fell our thunder, And their voice grew still and tame, Bomarsund we rent asunder, Sveaborg expired in flame. But we spared the trader's palace, And we spared the fisher's cot, As we struck for England's honourâ But for blood and vengeance not. We return, but not down-hearted; Not a comrade vails his brow: Proud and joyous we departed, And as proud return we now. VIII. Prayer for Peace. God of Battles! give us peace! Not the peace of beaten slaves; Not the truce that Mammon craves, Wavering, frail and insecure, Such as despots bid endureâ Smouldering lull that gives them breath For redoubling flames of death; Fragile thing with terror rife; Trembling nurse of growing strife: Give the peace that men bestow Who, with ne'er a second blow, Kill the cause of warâthen cease. God of Battles! give us peace! God of Battles! give us peace. Peace, O Lord! to us though dear, Peace may prove a thing to fear. There is peace far worse than strife: Peace that rots a people's life; When, alike in darkness thrust, Sword and heart together rust, And the light of honour dies In a scabbard made of lies. Peace may kill by slow decay Those, no sword of Hun could slay, Leaving of the greatness gone But a fleshless skeleton. Sunk in lust and shameless ease, War may bring to such as these Fame's aspiring, glory's goal, Resurrection for the soul. God of Battles! give us peace; Not a peace that mocks the land, Binding wounds with poisoned hand. There is peace that more hath slain Than e'er fell in red campaign, Stricken still and silent down, Through the country and the town. Soldiers true, they battled well; Long they fought, sublime they fell. No one pauses by their grave; No one writes: âHere lie the brave. âHunger slew them, cold and tears, âThrough their long campaign of years. âSoldiers march in honour's name; âHear in music future fame; âWin from banded brothers, might, âSink at last in glory's light; âAnd, when death has laid them low, âGain a tribute from the foe: âBraver those, who slumber hereâ âTheirs nor friend nor fame to cheer; âTheirs, amid life's growing shade, âBut the song their own hearts made. âTheirs no tribute o'er the grave: âStill they fought!âHere lie the brave.â God of Battles! give us peace. Yet we shrink not from the strife, Long as honour claims a life. Well we know that battle brings Many sorrows on its wings: Want and waste, and pressure sore; But we'll bear them all, and more; Well we know that war demands Many offerings at our hands: Bread to fail, and blood to flow: Freely, gladly, we'll bestow, Bear our burden brave and mute, So our burden bears its fruit, And no treacherous arts undo Valour's deeds of honour true. So that when, bereft and lorn, Trembling we exult and mourn, Counting all we lost and won, When the great brave battle's done, By the closed grave we can stand, Million mourners hand in hand, Breathing o'er our dear ones slain: âGod be praised! 'twas not in vain.â God of Battles! give us peace; And oh! grant that, while we fight, We may strike for truth and right. Not for Islam's wreck alone; Not to prop the Austrian's throne; Not, as dotard folly doth, Smite the Hun to save the Goth. Not, oh! mockery's crowning work! Spurn the Pole, yet help the Turk! God of Battles! give us peace, Rich with honour's proud increase: Peace that frees the fettered brave; Peace that scorns to make a slave; Peace that spurns a tyrant's hand; Peace that lifts each fallen land; Peace of peoples, not of kings; Peace that conquering freedom brings; Peace that bids oppression cease: God of Battles! give us peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Waifs. I. Signs of Glory. What talk ye to Britons of star and cross, And medals and badges bright? An Englishman fights not for idle dross, But for honour, and glory, and right. Let milliner-soldiers their ribands boast, And struggle their clasps to win: An Englishman's breast is plain and bare, But the heart of a hero's within. No need to write on it, âThis man is braveââ For where is a Briton is not? Each one would have done the selfsame deed, Had he stood on the selfsame spot. He seeks no badge but the goodly sign That glows where Honour lives: The scar he gained in the battle's line Is the star that Glory gives. II. Calls to Battle. Go! flutter your eagles aloft on the wind In the hands of the bond and thrall: One soft timid sigh of the sister I love Shall lead me beyond them all. Go! shatter the echoes with trumpet and drum, And summon your slaves to the fray: To think of one smile of the girl of my heart, Shall carry me farther than they. Go! call on the name of the monarch and priest; But England speaks nobler to meâ To think that I strike for its poorest and least, Will make me strike deeper than ye. Go! let all your prelates in proudest array Bid crouching battalions depart: But what is it all to a single prayer That soars from my mother's heart? III. Helping Hands. And has it come to this at length, That those who England sway, Must overlook our native strength For weakness far away? And doubting o'er the foeman's shock, Not trusting in our own, Must strive to piece the British rock With bits of meaner stone? Oh! woe betide the evil hour, And curse the craven part, When English hands shall lack the power To guard an English heart! Thrice welcome be each honest friend Who lifts a knightly lance, With England's lion line to blend Piedmont or gallant France. With him our path to fame shall be, With him our soldier's grave; For England loves the comrade free, And spurns the hireling knave. But woe betide the evil hour, And curse the craven part, When English hands shall lack the power To guard an English heart. Give me the man who strikes for right, Not him who kills for gold:â The flags that heroes bore in fight, Unfit is he to hold. A penny less, a penny more, His cause and country make:â Not such the men we sought of yore To fight for England's sake. Oh! woe betide the evil hour, And curse the craven part, When English hands shall lack the power To guard an English heart. But not so fall'n is England's might To need the hireling's aid, And make the field of honour's fight A mart of bloody trade. We still can keep our native land, We still can shield a friend; An English sword in English hand Can still make tyrants bend. Then woe betide the evil hour, And curse the craven part, That takes from English hands the power To guard an English heart. IV. Peace and War. Let faction vail its front of lies, Nor seek our cause to blast: The triumph of a party diesâ A nation's errors last. While proudly reigns triumphant wrong, And right lies bleeding low, 'Tis treason for the brave and strong To strike a feeble blow. For shame forbear the unmanly part, The cry of faction cease: Oh! Peace is dear to every heart, But Honour more than Peace. Peace! while the tyrant unsubdued Yet boasts that he can bring A wild barbarian multitude To crush us in the Spring? While yet his heel's on Asia's breast, And Poland lies in chains? While yet in anguish unredressed An outraged world remains? While yet his rod the nations kiss, And tremble at his name? To pause in such an hour as this, It were not Peaceâbut Shame. V. Brother-Lands. THE ENGLISHMAN TO THE AMERICAN. No hostile stranger-nations we, To war with impious hands: One land around a common sea; One people in two lands. In vain our kindred shores to part, Are waves between us thrown; The tide that warms a British heart, Is that which fills your own. No beacon ranged on either beach But like an angel stands, To call new hopes from each to each, And link our loving lands. No ship that sails from either shore, While to and fro it plies, But weaves the thread of friendship o'er The gulf that 'twixt us lies. No pilgrims from our harbours part, Or come with eager oars, But give you more of England's heart, And more to us of yours. No song that soothes our children's rest, But unto yours is dear; No lay that stirred our soldiers' breast, But yours have glowed to hear. No fame that flashed on Britain's brow, But gleams on yours alike: Then, if ye can, abjure us now, Forget it allâand strike! VI. The Fountains of History. The Genius of History stood on the height Of a hill that the sun had kissed; Deep, deep at its root was the brooding night, And its centre was circled by mist. And structures of Glory that promised to bide Till Time and Eternity meet, In fragments Titanic were rent from its side, And lay nameless wrecks at its feet. And beautiful forms, like to palaces fair, Stood glittering a short sunny day; Like bright exhalations they rose in the air, And vanished as trackless away. The layers of the mountain were piled one by one, By the ages that went there to rest, As History climbed to the light of the sun, And looked o'er the world from its crest. She beheld how a blight had crept over the earth And cankered the spirit of man: The souls without glory, and hearts without worth, And lives dwindled down to a span. Some creeping to labour with faint bleeding feet, And cursing the work that they wrought; And some, with brains shrivelled, like scrolls in the heat, For want of a single great thought. And hard, bony hands, that were griping for gain, In the guerdons to other men due; And few who were longing, but longing in vain, For the good, and the great, and the true. Then History spake to the myriads of man, In a moment of sympathy rare, When with passion electric a noble thought ran Through the mass of their mean, sordid care: âDeepâdeepâhidden deep in the mountain away, âLies buried the pure virgin gold: âThere is tinsel enough in the world of to-dayâ âGo! bring me the ore of the old.â Then stood forth the children of passion and thought, And delved in the mountain's dark home, Till the pure crystal springs bounded forth as they wrought, From the marble of Athens and Rome. Oh! then how the myriads came gathering around! How the heart in their bosom beat fast! How the blood in their veins was beginning to bound, As they drank the great cup of the past. How paltry the present appeared to their eyesâ How worthless each poor selfish endâ With the light of their heaven beginning to rise, And their heaven itself to extend! Thus ever the fountains that History unsealed, In their bright early purity roll: And the lepers of life wander there to be healed Of the canker corroding the soul.</field>
