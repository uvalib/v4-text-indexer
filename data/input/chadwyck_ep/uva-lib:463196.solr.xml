Well I consydre at this present daye The vertues of noble queene Catharyne are remembred at this present daye. No fewe hathe tawlke of her highe worthynes, Howe vnto vertue she gaue her alwaye, And deadys of pytee passinglye doubtles, Withestandinge her enemye, for all his stowtnes, The sathanyke Serpent, whoe had her in hate, But neauer cowlde her (to his purpose) culpate. For that she was so speciall notable, For she was so speciall gratious, her life the worthier to be put in recordis. In this inconstant moste daungerous tyme, (—Whiche to adnote is muche myserable, As maye bee expreste in prose or in ryme, Concordinge withe oure first mateir, the slyme, Whiche as it is muche lothesome and fylthie, So all earthelye our practycing is gyltie;—) I thought it goode for reformation, Her life may be as rule others lyues in vertue to dyrecte. By her examples to vertues increase, Wheare restethe gohostelye inclynation, To prompte them withe this in á readynes, As rule to induce to all godlynes, Thus muche to that ende seruynge the rather For that in knowledge the same wee gather. While she was set by, this Royalme florisched, but not so afterwardys.Well ought her holye conuersation Heere, in this Royalme, bee put in remembraunce, For, while she was in digne estymation, It florischt in wealthe, and all abundaunce That speciallye serued to mannys sustynaunce, Withe of Goddys lawe bothe awe and reuerence, And nowe fallen into great inconuenyence, Errour and couetousnes entred this Royalme after her deposition.As into erroure moste specyallye By Schismys and Sectys, of Sathans owne raysinge, Withe Couetousnes vniuersallye, To sundry (the pooarys) vtter vndoinge, Due Obedyence raschelye contempnynge; Theis, withe hundreadys of myseryes mo, Hathe entred sithe shee was reiected so. This Royalme plaged for synnes accustome, spronge from the cheif.Whiche I impute a plage of punyschement By all examples of antiquytee, For synnes accustome moste worthelye sent, Engendred from the highe nobilytee, And spredde ouer all by muche fragilytee, Whiche (I heere saye) may well bee veryfied, Her holy life myght in nowise abyde, This warke is but as a sparke in comparason of her whoale lyfe.As appearethe in this narration, Compacte, in sorte as oure knowledge dothe leade, And with others auxiliation, That muche in the same did vs also steade; Whoe that vouchesauethe, the same for to reade; Thoughe oure saide traueyle, in this present warke, To her whoale life is but as a small sparke; Directinge the same to youre maiestee This warke (as to her chefest jewell) directed to our Queenys maiestie. As to her onlye, and deareste of all, Not of purpose, or meere necessitee, Her hereby vnto remembraunce to call, And els (witheoute this) not so to bee fall, But, as yee and the godlye dothe the same, So, oure posterytee to heeare of her fame. Her I heere lyken to Grysilde the goode, By names Grysilde and Walter our Queenys Father and Mother examplyfyed. As well I so maye, for her great patience; Consyderinge althing is withe her howe it stoode, Her geauynge that name theare is none offense; Your noble Father workinge like pretence As Walter to Grysilde, by muche vnkyndenes, By name of Walter I dooe hym expresse. Whiche noble Father, I cannot but saye, Oure Kynge somewhat ledde by the counsell of vndiscreeit persons. Was leadde in some parte by meanys of the light; Perhaps for synne, that reigned at that daye, God suffred this Royalme so to alter quyte, Or for that He wolde shewe His dyuyne myght, Hable terecte by the weake and frayle sex, Howe eauer Sathan His Churche did heere vex; Or, peraduenture, Hee wolde it bee so In quyet estate humylite is not tryed as yn the tyme of temptation. To trye (in meekenes) her stabilitee, In higher meryte to haue her to go, For to alaye heere her fragilite; In quyet estate shewthe not humylite To eauerlastinge remuneration, As in troble and tyme of temptation. For owghtes heere wrytinge amysse this Author humbly desyreth perdon.Such my concepte, conceaved in this thinge; If from youre pleasure it swerue anye waye Youre gratious perdon I crave on kneis knelinge Before (in readinge) my fawte me bewraye; Commendinge your grace bothe by night and daye, Meanynge to Hym, bothe wakinge and sleepinge, That hathe your Mothers sweete sowle in keepinge. Omitted here is a multi-page, point by point synopsis of the entire poem, entitled ‘The Table’. Caput Primum. Heere ensuethe a true and moste notable Historye of a right noble and famous ladye produced in Spayne, intytuled, THE SECONDE GRISILDE, practiced not longe oute of this tyme, in muche parte tragedous, as delectable bothe to Heearers and Readers. Wryters hathe manye endeauored their paynes Twoe cawses why wryters endeaver their paynes. Historyes famous to put in recordis, Some for their practice, some for meede or gaynes, Muche delytinge bothe to ladyes and lordis, In whiche their stiles and pryncipall exordis Muche ornatlye, as seemed to them beste, They sawe the same moste florischeingely dreste. Whois worthie steppis ensuynge (as I can) The goode Queene Catharyne. (Thoughe an ydiot the probate sapyentis) I heere entende of á noble woman (As addinge of myne to their preasydentys) To wright and set furthe the godly talentis, For an exampler in some maner sute, Oother of vertue to take thearby frute. Her meekenes speciallye surmountynge.Whoe, for her passinge noble vertues, Specially meekenes in aduersytee, In all historyes of Gentyls or Jues, As vnfaynedly seemethe vnto mee, To her maye no juste comparason bee; Wronged as shee was, meekely to sustayne Almoste it was a thinge farre inhumayne. This noble woman Catharyne, for her meeknes, applied to Grysilde.This noble ladye, this godlye Grysilde, So applied for onlye the propretee, On whome we purpose oure mateir to bilde, As to entreat by goode authorytee, As probate witnessies hathe learned mee, Concernynge her Countrey, to name speciall, In Spayne shee had her firste oryginall. Her Fathers name Ferdynande, her mother called Elizabeth.Doughter shee was to one Ferdynande, Kynge of Spayne and Cicilye also; Her mother was called, as I vndrestande, Elizabethe, as oother sundrye mo; After, when firste shee was hable to go, To nurische her in sorte to her degree, Ladyes weare choase, the beste that gote myght bee. Howe she had aptenes to all vertuous exercyses.In literate knowledge entred shee was, By lyttle and lyttle, as shee in age grwe, Towardislye althingis withe her came to passe That specially framed vnto vertue; Suche instincte of grace God can her indue, That by her vertues in so tendre age Shee shoulde of honour ascende the worthie stage. Ascendinge vpp to more maturytee, Deus suberbis (sic) resistit, humilibus dat gratiam. Attaynynge to perfecte discretion Alwayes an inclynation had shee To lowlynes, that cheeif perfection, Gatheringe, as rule for her direction, In holye Scriptures howe theare is alowde All meekenes of God, resistinge the prowde. Of her personage description to make, Of her forme and personage. She was right comely and chearful withe all; In voyce, somewhat bigge sowndinge she spake; In stature, but meane, and bonarly withe all; Her coolour sanguyne, that men dothe beste call; What to this purpose neadethe more to bee tolde? She was a ladye pleasaunte to beeholde. So perfecte she was not in personage, Pulchra facie, sed pulchrior mente. But farre perfecter was her inwarde mynde; To voyde all wilful insolent outerage (Exited by carnal voluptee blynde) This remeadye (by grace) she wolde beste fynde, To geeve herselfe to contemplation In whiche was muche her exercitation. Greatlye she loued to heeare and to reade Howe she favored the Scriptures of God and the lyues of Sainctes. The holye Scriptures moste speciallye, Also the lyues of Sainctys that bee deade, To holye life that muche myght edifie; In whiche accustomynge customablie, It was a certaigne spiritual habyte That closed her from this worldis vayne delyte. Howe she not delyted in vayne toyes, but alwayes in vertuous busynesses.Withe stoole and needyl she was not to seeke And oother practycingis for ladyes meete; To pastyme at Tables, Ticktacke or Gleeke, Cardys, Dyce, or vayne toyes accustomed yeete, She thought not seemed for women discreete, But weare incitamentys to sinne and vice, Whearfore she gaue her to oother exercise. Of her exercise bothe moarnynge and nyght on her kneeis in prayer.Every moarnynge and also at nyght Twoe howres (at the leaste) on kneeis wolde she sitte, Commendinge herselfe to God moste of myght, Her life that Hee wolde alwayes ordre itt, From synne by His grace as to prohybit, That to His will moste honorable Herse myght bee euermore conformable. To pooare as riche she was chearfull, to all goode deadys alwaies ready to doo her furtheraunce.To euery creature, riche other poore, Shee shewed herselfe moste amyably, Of contention she loued no stoore, But to bee in quyet specially; Her life shee heere ledde muche charitably, To what goode deade that anyman woulde Readye alwaies to dooe the beste shee coulde. She was pyteful and ful of mercye vnto the pooare.As she was chearful to creatures all, So was she euermore muche pitefull; Her charitee to the pooare was not small, To dooe them comforte she wolde not bee dull, No vertuous deade she wolde disanull But muche rather the vttermuste she myght, Wheare slacknes was, the partyes to exite. But for she was her parentys yeat vndre, Her deadys orderynge to Goddys special praise, and not to anye vayne glorye. So amplye she coulde not her mynde extende, Yeat at her dooingis dyverse dyd wundre, And in their hartys did her greatly commende; Whateauer she did was to a goode ende, Only (as to saye) Goddis specyal praise, Vayne glory (as Deathe) detestinge alwaise. The youthe that to her weare associat, Howe her Cowrte was as Religious, for bryngynge vpp of her yowthe. As vpon her, their mistresse, to attende, Vsinge taches light and illicitat, She thearof wolde them moste streitely defende, Withe oother meanys if thei liste not amende, So that in that parte (whiche was meruelous) Her Courte was as it had been Religious. For princelye behauyour, nurture, and suche For her pryncely behauyoure, bothe poore and riche desyred her presence. To womanlynes that did appertayne, None myght (certaynely) commende her to muche, She had in that kinde the vearye right veyne; Of her princelye presence all men weare fayne, Not onlye the cheif had suche affection But also the pooare had her in dilection. She was a woman of wondreful grace Wheare God inspirethe to grace, muste neadys prosper vnto the same. As in oure age of long tyme did springe, All vertue specially she did embrace And vice (of truthe) vtterly contempnynge, Whiche was wondreful in so younge a thinge; But, wheare God geavethe illumynation, Muste neadys shewe light of goode conuersation, As she was vertuous inwardelye, so she ordred her outwardys example.To whiche she had a specyall respecte, Aswel her outwardys whoale fashyonynge By euyl example on none to reflecte, As inwardelye she abhorred suche thinge, Muche prudently this wise consyderinge, Whois example inducethe to lightnes Obumbrethe of Grace the glossinge brightnes. Caput 2. Howe this noble Seconde Grysilde was marryed into Greate Brytayne, to a moste worthie and towardys Prynce theare, called Arthur, whoe lyued withe her but uery shorte tyme, so (in his tendre age) departinge this life, and of her piteful lamentation for hym. The brute of this ladye blowne (by reporte) into Englande. This princely lady, Grisilde, (as wee name,) Withe her deere parentes abidinge in Spaine, Whois passinge worthynes was blowne by fame Vnto the noble cowntrey of Brytayne, Wheare at that tyme a famous kynge did reigne, Oute of this life departed longe agone, Henrye the Seavynthe.Called (in his tyme) the Seconde Salomon. Of Prynce Arthur, and of his pryncely towardnes.Unto this kinge of famous memorye A prynce theare was, moste goodly florischinge, By name Arthur, so called proprelye, In all this worlde no towarder younge thinge; Whois famous Father that tyme thus castinge That as he was noble in estate To haue hym machte accordinge to the rate. This prudent kinge in Spayne that tyme herde tell Cownsell takinge for the maryage of this ladye Catharyne. To bee this ladye, fayre Grysilidis, Withe pryncely vertues howe she did excell, That towardys her his mynde occupied is, Counselinge thearin withe Counselours of his, Whiche debated throughe sage aduisement Founde it to bee thinge moste expedient. After, with speede, ambassadours weare sent Messengers sent for entreatye of the sayde marryage. Vpon this marryage for to entreat, Which, on that one partye wayed to entent, And on the other by polecye greate, For to conclude their braynes they much did beate, As for bothe partyes seeamed to the beste That myght be cause of tranquillytee and reste. This weyghtye mateir brought to conclusion, The marryage concluded betweene Prynce Arthur and the Ladye Catharyne. Our Britayne ambassadours whome did reverte, In whiche was wrought no maner collusion, But faitheful true meanynge on either parte; To whiche goode Grisilde graunted her whoale harte, And shortely after, most worthelye, as she ought, Into Brytayne was honorablye brought, Wheare the despousaile was solemplye kepte, The despousaile solemply kept witheoute carnall cognytion. Withe suche worthie tryumphe as did belonge; But the marryed togeathers not slepte, For the saide Prynce was but tendre and yonge, Leste to his growinge it myght dooe muche wronge; Yeat, notwithestandinge that myght not bee had, Either of oother weare passingelye glad. Prynce Arthur, withyn shorte space after his marryage, departed this life.But, well awaye! halas the heauye case! After this myrthe and ioyous felycitee, Togeathers in healthe they ioyed no longe space, This noble Prynce this life departed hee, For whome was sorowinge of euery degree, Moste specially of faire Grysilidis, So soone her deeareste in suche wise to mysse. The doleful lamentation of this younge lady for her looue late departed.“Halas” (she saide) “what happe is me betyde My speciall jewell aboue oother all Thus to forgoe, no lengre to abyde, To my great greeif and hynderaunce not small!

My frindis to this ende had expectation I to haue prosperde wheare deathe can preuent, And they to haue ioyed in oure generation, Whiche all is nowe brought to desolation, After this sayinge, ‘Thoughe man proponethe, God as Hee pleasethe althingis disposethe.’ “Hoapinge suche wise in my prosperous successe She takethe this greeif for her demerytes. Withe me they departed verye largelye; Vpon this myshappe what maye they nowe gesse But me to accompte for moste vnhappye?

For longe tyme after her sorowes endured for her Looue.But, for all that, the lamentation (Longe tyme enduringe) of this noble mayde, After her Loves so expiration, It cannot of mee bee thorowlye sayde; All sumptuous attyrementes weare aside layde, Her christall iyen for longe tyme after Weare as a lymbecke distillinge cleare water. Great weare the sorowes bothe of Father and Mother and all the Royalme for the saide Prince.The heavye cheare bothe of Father and Mother And of the whoale Royalme to longe weare to tell, But, for myne entent is this and none other Cheiflye tentreat of this noble Damoysell, The reste (for this season) I wyll let dwell, And ferdre wright howe, after heauynes, Her joyes agayne began for to encrese. Caput 3. Heere Grysilde is marryed to Walter (her firste husbondys brother); his Father dyethe, and Walter withe Grysilde crowned Kynge and Queene, beetweene whome theare spryngethe a Prynce whoe lyuethe but small tyme, and afterwardys a Princesse called Marye, and of Goddis wondrefull workeynge for her. This towardys younge Prince departed and gone And his funeral obsequye cleane paste, His famous Father, the Seconde Salomon, (Wyttelye thus weyinge) began at the laste In his inwarde mynde to compasse and caste For this noble ladye howe to ordayne That so was hither yssued from Spayne. At the concludinge of the mateir furste It was agreed, if the Prynce dyd departe A Douarye (of duetye) neadys have she muste; Whiche nowe the kynge reuoluethe in his harte, Consyderinge he maye not from his promysse starte. Pryncys in their leaugis to bee fownde doble, Is cawse (oftetymes) of muche hate and troble. Ferdre, as thus consyderinge also This saide noble ladye whome to repayre, And yeearely suche Douarye from hense to goe By her exchaungeinge this soyle or layre, Yeat rather he caste (syttinge in his chayre) So that it myght bee conuenyently doone, To haue her marrye withe his oother soone. For at that season, besydis thother deadde, He had a soone whiche Walter had to name, That nowe was Prynce heere in his brothers steadde, For whome his Father dothe buselye frame, As saide is before, taccomplische the same, In whiche he dyd moste wyttye counsell take That wyttelye cowlde for the purpose make. Bycause the case was seelden seene in vre One brother to marrye withe the other's wife, To dooe that their dooingis myght take effecte sure Afterwardys to bee deuoyde of all strife, Withe diligent searche, throughe meanys excessyue, All Christian clergye they did examyne Vpon the saide case, what they cowlde defyne. Whiche (certaynly) not headely and soone But withe muche sobre deliberation, Fownde (by goode learnynge) it myght well bee doone, So defynynge in their Conuocation; After, yeat ferdre, for more confyrmation, This sage Salomon, to voyde all maner blame, Sent vnto Rome to haue judged the same. Wheare then the Busshoppe withe his whoale Counsell, Examynynge (trulye) the foresaide case, As thynge probable, lawful and well, They it so tryed in conuenyent space Confirmynge the same, remyttinge apace The messengers so in the mateir sent, Their Kynge to proceeade in his goode entent. Vpon whiche notable approbation This noble ladye was marryed agayne To the saide Walter, of highe commendation For his personage, so passinge soueraigne, Whoe (certaynlye), as I beleue certayne, For comelynes and stature to accownte No Prynce (then lyuynge) theare dyd hym surmowte (sic). Ere longe tyme after, this saide Salomon By God was sent for to an other life; Walter (his soon) the Crowne tooke hym vpon, Crownynge also Queene goode Grisilde his wife, Betweene whiche twoe flowres, to ceasse heere all strife, A Prynce theare sprang moste beawtious to see And to name Arthur (certaynlye) had hee. Of whome this whoale Royalme was passingely glad, Moste highely hoaping in his posterytee; But, after shorte space, hee made them all sad For, of his life heere the shorte breuytee, Hense was hee take by Deathes crudelytee, Throughe what occasion I cannot defyne But that it pleased God so to assigne. Thoughe Walter (the Father) manfully and stowte, (Muche stryuynge againste Nature ynwardelye) Asmuche as hee myght, beare the mateir owte, Yeat to his harte (nodoutes) it went ful nye; But, tochinge the Mother specyallye, Neauer was theare woman (I thinke nolesse) That for her childe myght shewe more heauynes. Shee wepte, shee suobbed, shee sighed ofte witheall, Shee wrounge her handys of motherly pytee, Shee wolde not holde state vndre cloth of pall, Shee whoale forgote her highe regalytee Shee tooke his deathe as moste calamytee, For that it was her firste begoten childe, For whome all joyes she vtterlye exilde. Nother wolde shee in companye frequent, Nother wolde shee in pleasures oughtes delyte, Nother wolde shee harken to instrument, Nother yeat passe what tawlke men did recyte, Nother wolde shee her feeadinge appetyte; Rather shee wolde, then oughtes of theis enure, Shewe cheeare as symple or basched creature. This wise shee wolde her selfe ofte tymes complayne, “My louelye childe (halasse!) I haue forlorne Whome into this life I yealded with payne, Thoughe to my comforte, when hee was heere borne, And nowe so sooane his life to bee oute worne That was somuche my consolation; No merueyle then of my lamentation. “Hee was my worldely cheif ioye and comforte, Nexte to my lorde and soueraigne husbande, For hym I sure had muche vauntinge reporte Of highe and eke meane thorowe all this lande; The cause, so causinge, no lengre to stande I haue nowe loste, omyttinge my sweete soone, The joye, the looue, that earste I had so woone. “I haue omytted that longe I dyd desire, A Prynce, this Royalme in quyet state in staye; Howe maye I (agayne) another requyre? To tempte my Lorde God I feare, and so maye. A Deathe! why haste thoue hym taken awaye, So highe á treasure as (lyuynge) was hee, And so to thousandys aswell as to mee. “Hee was not as chylde of the commone sorte, Hee was a Prynce and heyre vnto á Kinge, Somuche the heauyer his tyme heere so shorte, Somuche the more myste for State contynuynge, Somuche the more for hym my sorowynge, Somuche for hym my contynuall mone; I was á mother, and nowe am none.” Longe bode this lady and excellent Pryncesse Lamentynge her chyldis this life departure, Longe laye in her harte by muche heauynes The thynge whiche in no wise she myght agayne recure, Nature compelled her so to endure, For, as she was benynge in her estate, So was she (by nature) affectionat. Affectionat she was vnto all vertue, Thoughe not affectionat to her selfe will; Affectionat she was peace to contynue, For that cause her loue laye her childe so vntill; Her will was hee shoulde the State heere fulfill When Walters breathe oute of this life did yeeade, But otherwise God had thearin decreeade. Yeat wiselye (at last) calling to remembraunce That Goddys so workeinge she ought not to resiste, Shee tooke it as thinge of Goddys ordynaunce, And made as hee weare of her nowhit myste; Ferdre consyderinge in Hym to consiste, As Hee her sent that sweeatiste creature, To sende an other at His owne pleasure. Togeather they lyued certayne yeares after, The numbre howe manye I cannot well gesse, Wheare God remembred his servaunte Walter, Sendynge by Grisilde a fayre newe encrease, A goodlye younge thinge, a Pryncesse pearlesse, Whome, to bee Christianed as folke did carye, Her parentis wolde her to bee called Marye. Of whiche noble Babe the Mother was fayne, Father also, as right goode cause had hee, Withe all the Cowrte, bothe gentylman and swayne, And thorowe the Royalme was highe felycitee, Withe praysingis to God the moste that myght bee, Whiche well appeared, thoughe longe afterwarde, They weare (in effecte) of Hym that tyme herde. For, longe tyme after, this noble Virgyn Of all this whoale worlde proved the cheif flowre; The glorye of God shee did agayne begyn That was as layde downe by dyuyllische erroure, And it establisched, by Goddys helpinge powre, In suche sodayne and wondrefull fashyon, To all this worldys greate admyration. Yeat, undrestande yee, ere this pryncelye mayde Was brought (as is saide) to her highe estate, Neauer was Pryncesse more soarer affayde In taistinge sorowes of wondrefull rate, Ynowghe to haue geauen an vttre checke mate Eauyn to the hardiest that eauer was seene; God was her ayde, it cowlde not els haue beene. But for on Grisilde oure mateir dothe depende, And not on Marye pryncipallye tentreat, Leste I myght happen be thought to offende Throughe Adulation, a meddeler muche great, I will thearfore nowe (chalengeinge no cheate In sorte suche wise of commendation) Ferdre of Grisilde heere make relation. Caput 4. Of Grisildis vpp tradinge her goodlye younge Pryncesse; Of her syngular towardnes to all vertue howe this Royalme (that season) florisched in moste highe honour and felicite; and of this Grisildis godly perfection, to thexample of all noble women euyn to the worldys ende. Grisilde enioyinge this virginal floure, And shee receauynge Puryfication, She had it nurisched in her owne bowre Till tyme was come of ablactation; Then tooke she on her muche theducation To have her traded in honorable sorte, Of whiche I am not heere hable to reporte. But thus muche we dare heere boldely to wright, She brought her vpp withe all dylygencye In all kynde of vertue somuche as shee myght, To Goddys dwe honour moste speciallye; As she encreased to knowledge more hye, So dyd goode Grisilde for her still prouyde To haue her softred as chicke by her syde. Shee had to her sorted men well expert In Latyne, Frenche, and Spaynysche also, Of whome, before they from her did reuert, She gathered knowledge, with graces other mo; The thynge atchieued departed her not fro, For, as shee had promptnes the thynge to contryue, So had shee memory passinge retentyue. Emonges her instructours, before other ferre, Highely florischeinge in the Latyne tonge, She had the famous Thomas Lynaker, Whois rules for her remaynethe vs emonge, Throughe whome in Latyne she ornatlye spronge, Whiche afterwardys, bearing domynation, Was vnto her moste highe consolation. For none theare was that had withe her to dooe, Straunger or other, what soeauer he was, But his demaundys she cowlde answeare vntoo, And geue graue sentence in moste profounde case; So wiselye for her good Grisilde dyd purchace That no kynde of vertue she dyd wante, But weare withe her lynkte as in couenaunte. This Walter and Grysilde suche wise indude Withe this moste godly and towardys issue, Betweene whome afterwardys, heere to conclude, Was neauer moe, their styrpe to contynue; But as to rype age this more and more grue, So trulye shee, withe beawtye decorat, Dyd passingelye florysche in her estate. By longe tyme after Walter and Grysilde Their lyues they ledde in highe felicitee; His will (moste gladly) she alwayes fulfilde, By all that laye in her possybylytee. In Brytayne that tyme was muche tranquyllytee, Plentye of althyngis in computation That serued (of neade) to mannys sustentation. The honour of God duelye florischinge, His seruyce mayntayned eauerye wheare, The riche the pooare right gladlye nurischinge, The greatest (at stresse) biggest burdayne to beare, To that was godlye each leanynge his eare; So decent ordre was not then ouer all, But after it had a muche sodayne fall. Of which I will not (at this tyme) heere saye, But tawke of Grysilde, that soueraigne wight, Whoe ordred her life so godlye alwaye That none cowld euyl her, sayinge but the right; The loue of God was alwayes in her sight, Before thyngis worldelye ynwardlye castynge To please the Lorde that was eauerlastynge. Her almes to the pooare was ample and large, None came to her gatys withe oute refrescheinge; To her Almosyner shee gaue in charge To bee dylygent in dystrybutinge, Moste specially to haue á respectinge To the ympotent, aged, and suche, They (before other) moued her harte muche. This godlye pytee ferdre had shee In townys and villagies, neare wheare she laye, She wolde (secreatlye) sende to goe see To knowe wheare neaded her almes to conuaye; Some shurtys, some smockes, some certaigne monaye, Or what thynge els was thought they dyd neede, As she perceaued so sholde they sure speede. Sometyme wolde she sende secreatlye also To weeite wheare the pooare weare layde in childe bed; Knowinge thearof, she wolde herself ofte goe, And cause to bee brought bothe ale, beeare, and brede, Candyll, and suche thynges that myght doo them stede, Bothe sheeates and lynen leauynge theare behynde, Withe also monaye other neeadys to fynde. She was not quoysche, disdaynefull or prowde, But cowlde be pleased to vysite the pooare; Withe God thearfore she was highely alowde And after (withe fauour) let yn at His doore; Thoughe heere agaynste her Hee let the wynde stoore, It was the more to her sowlys salvation, For heauyn is woonne by muche trybulation. This godlye maner ofte wolde shee frequent At Greenewiche, she lyinge alone from the Kynge; The Fryers at matyns withe hartye entent She wolde bee theare, in devotyon kneelinge, A mantyll aboute her whiche was no riche thynge, Theare in prayer and contemplation Renderinge to God sweete commendation. All was her harte in holynesse pight, Thoughe in this worlde yeat not of the same, In worldely thynges shee had no delyte, For whiche in heauyn is regestred her name; To that onlye ende she fullye dyd frame, As all that eauer her faschyons knwe Can yeat recorde my sayinge to bee true. And for the deuotion she specially had In the remembraunce of Christes Passion deere (Her spyrite, ynwardely, to comforte and glad) An ymage, that representation beere, She dyd let make, in wondreful manere, Vpon á mownte á lyttle from London, Besydys the waye goynge to Islyngeton; Not to any ydolatryall entent (As myserable men manye dothe holde) But to the beholders to represent Of Christe towardys man the mercyes manyfolde. Her feruencye in vertue cannot bee tolde, For studiouslye shee neauer dyd cease But day by daye in vertue to encrease. Ferdre, yeat more of her goodnes texpresse, Thoughe she from Brytayne weare an alyan, This was moste true, witheoute all doubtefulnes, Aboue all nations she loued an Englischeman, And dyd for manye as well proued than; And I for them thus muche agayne will saye, They loued her withe all that in them laye. When shee on Progresse in the somers tyde Roade with her Walter themselfes to solace, Wheare they did come the Countrey farre and wyde Wolde thycke assemble to beholde her face, Cryinge á mayne “Christe saue her noble grace,” Withe secreat tawlke her highelye commendynge Asmuche as they wolde dooe Walter their Kynge. Besydis all this, this moste excellent Queene A syngular zeale had vnto learnynge, As bothe in Oxforde and Cambrydge was seene, In mayntaynynge lectures, and Scholars helpeinge, With manye a gyfte to the Churchesse aydinge; What thynge was neadful to vertues pleasaunce She was moste readye to dooe her furtheraunce. The gratious deadys of this worthye woman, Whiche are well knowne to sundry yeat lyuynge, And shall neauer dye by all that I can, If thearto maye helpe my symple wrytynge, All to entytle passethe my cunnynge, But for somuche as to my knowledge came I haue, and shall, gladlye set furthe the same. Caput 5. Howe Walter sought meanys to bee dyuorced from Grysilde his wife; howe his Counselours (for feare) then shranke from the truthe; of the great Cardynall Thomas Wulsaye; also of Anne Bullayne, on whome Walter set specially his harte, her as to marrye in goode Grysildis steade. After with Walter her soueraigne lorde She had beene matched nye twenty yeares space, The cursed Enemye, sower of dyscorde, Began to sue his accustomed trace, Goode Grysildis estate for to difface, Moste wickedlye that anye can discusse; All, for she was to hym contraryous. Some wycked theare weare, at his exitation, (To picke a thanke of hym their soueraygne) That prompted Walter after this fashyon;— For that Grysilde was so longe tyme barayne, Wantynge a Prynce his name heere to mayntayne, That he thus sholde, as for that purpose, make Her to geue upp, and some younger to take. Or whither it came of his owne headye mynde, (As certaigne it was he wolde bee sensuall), It shall not (at this tyme) of mee bee dyffynde, But furthe the mateir I prosequute shall. This motion muche laye in his memoryall, Sore occupied thearin bothe daye and nyght, For muche it was pleasinge to his appetyte. Ferdre, to mayntayne his fonde opynyon, False Flaterabundy to hym drewe neare, Ensensinge hym after this condytion, That muche more kendeled hym in the matere, For that she was wife vnto hys brother, Whearby he had moste juste occasion To make of her a separation. Theis twoe pryncyples broached in suche wise Walter his Counsell counseled thear vpon, Whoe, perceauynge his earnest entreprise, Condescended to his purpose anon: They durste not (contrary) speake their reason, He was ofte tymes so rageinge furyous, Whiche, in a Prynce, was tomuche pyteous. Halasse! that Counselours in any case Shoulde shrynke oughtis their headys to speake in the right! Halasse! that Prynces sholde seeme to lacke grace To suffre flaterers to byde in their sight! Whoe so that shrynkethe the truthe to recyte When eauer hee bee demaunded his mynd Is but a flaterer in vearye kynde. If Pryncys wyllis maye haue no denyall, But, as they wyll, their wyllys to take effecte, What neade theare then bee Counselinge tryall Or anye Counselours (at all) electe, Sithe, at their wyllys, they will take or reiecte? As goode no Counsell but they herde may bee, And better none then hyde the verytee. A Counsell (of olde), as hathe beene telled, Is choasen, and set, to ordre á kynge, And ought not (throughe forse) to bee compelled But as true justice appoyntethe the thynge, Takynge fundation on this olde sayinge, Twoe wytts (or moe) to bee better then one; So they to termyne, and not one alone. Whye are they choase of the auncyent sorte But for their wisedome and godly prudence? The younge gaddyng wytts returned á torte For that they lacke the like experyence. If then in them bee wylfull neglygence, In case of truth to woorke contraryous, They shall sure rue their deade vngratius. So nowe the Kynge withe his Counsellis consent Hathe fullye determyned in this case; Grysilde, whyther she wyll or no bee content, She muste (no remedye) resigne vpp her place, Theare was for her no other maner grace; Of whiche manye light braynes weare ioyous and glad, But oother godlye moste ynwardelye sad. The younkers (lyke lackwyttes) hoapeth nowe faste To see this sodayne alteration, Foolischelye bleatynge owte many a blaste, Of vayne wytlesse communycation, Vndre this sorte and braynsycke fashyon, “Nowe shall wee sure haue some goodly younge seade, When Walter is gone, to reigne in his steade; “Nowe shall this sure feche bee feched aboute, To haue some fresche Prynce ouer vs to reigne, So shall all countreyes of vs stande in doubte, And of oure fauours to bee glad and fayne, Whiche neadys to this Royalme muste purchesse great gayne; So shall oure Kyngys mynde in quyet bee sett, When he to the same some younge peece shall gett.” Thoughe light kyttische wyttys lysted to saye so, Olde, prouydent, sobre, wise and dyscreete, They wyste it sholde breede muche ymmynent woe If so goode Grysilde weare caste vndre feete, Depryued her Crowne, whiche was farre vnmeete; The case secreatly so consyderynge, Bycause they coulde not remeady the thynge. Thomas Wolsey CardynallAt that selfe season in Brytayne theare was A certayne great and myghtye Cardynall, Whoe was of Counsell to brynge this passe, A wycked man, a vearye Belyall, Puffed withe pryde moste passinge speciall, Whoe (certaynly) witheoute cause or skyll Towardys goode Grysilde beeare lytle goode wyll. Hee counseled (men saide) withe Astronomyers (Or what other secte I cannot well saye, Weare they Sothesayers or weare they lyers), Whyther he shoulde fall or florysche alwaye; Whois answeare was, he shoulde come to decaye By meanys (they fownde) of á certayne woman, But what shee sholde bee they coulde not saye than. Vpon whiche fonde enygmatization Vnto goode Grysilde ympute it dyd hee, Whearefore in his imagynation He wrought to haue her deposed to bee; But hee theare mystooke, it was not sure shee That shoulde hym brynge to his fynall myschaunce, Goode Grysilde neauer wrought anyes hynderaunce. Yeat one theare was that brought hym to his bane, And not goode Grysilde as he dyd it take, Whois pryncely honour nowe for to prophane To Fraunce he can á costelye journaye make, 1528 Wheare he for the Kyngis syster thear spake, Whiche mateir concluded to his entent, Whome he repayred, as wise as he went. Thoughe at his theare beeinge, as well it is knowne, He sundrye other mateirs dyd entreate, For greefys that towardys the Pope weare then growne By themperour, for vrgeant causes great, At whiche this Cardynall tooke a great heat, Yeat one speciall was to foresayde case, In whiche hee wanted bothe wisedome and grace. At tyme of canuasinge this mateir so, In the Cowrte (newe entred) theare dyd frequent A fresche younge damoysell, that cowlde trippe and go, To synge and to daunce passinge excellent, No tatches shee lacked of loues allurement; She cowlde speake Frenche ornatly and playne, Famed in the Cowrte, (by name) Anne Bullayne. Anne Bullayne. On her dyd Walter ofte caste his frayle iye, So stedfaste and sure, it myght not astarte; To hym theare was no suche creature earthlye, His loue was theare set neauer to departe, False Cupydo so stonge hym to the harte, He thought vnto her theare weare no mo lyke, Shee was to hym sweete as balme aromatyke. No lytle towardys her was hys longeinge luste, Oute of his presence he cowlde suffre her scace, At his commaundement she daunce and singe muste, Only aboue all shee stoode yn hys grace, Whiche sundrye and many adnoted the case, That well they wiste they wolde togeathers knytt, What soeauer lawe dyd oughtys prohybyt. A Prynce his mynde onse settynge on á thynge, Beyinge as wronge as possyble to be true, Cauyllations ynoughe some wyll soone brynge That to his purpose the thynge shall ensue; So (at this season) to frame for this Nwe They laide to goode Grysilde her sterylenes, Whiche she cowlde not helpe; God sendeth all increase. And (peraduenture) to God maye bee knowne Of His holye lawe some makynge but light, For that in their owne lande their seade is not sowne, Theyr posterytee He dothe it ofsmyte, And heyres erectethe pleasinge in His sight; Thoughe Kyngis to their myndys maketh muche thearfore, Yeat God in their dooyngis wyll sure haue an ore. Ferdre they burdayned goode Grysilde as thus, For that to his brother she marryed was Hee neeaded not to bee oughtys scrupulus, As nowe his enten (sic) to haue brought to passe. But of the mateir this was the uearye case, Hee had in hym a lyttle sensuall luste Whiche withe younge ware hee neadys accomplische muste. His mynde setteled on Anne in this wise, She was aduaunced Merquese of Penbrooke; As to their Queene, all dyd to her seruyce, And like to Queene was her statelye looke; Howbeit, many myght her scacelye brooke, So lowe (as shee) to clymbe so sodaynlye They feared to haue a fowle destynye. Caput 6. Of Walters sendinge to Rome for a divorsment but none myghte bee obteyned, he takinge his Progresse (the mean while of his messengers returnynge) to Grafton; Of Grysildys great patience in her aduersytee; Of the Cardynal's fall, and the causes of the same, And of his penytent departure oute of this life at Leyeestre Abbey. This peece pickte oute and chosen for the noanse Whearon Walters harte was earnestly sett, Messengers to Rome weare sent then attoanse A Diuorsment in all great haiste to gett; But this was thearof the veary whoale lett, The Churche (throughe dwe proofe) to let them marrye, The Pope (then beynge) wolde yt not contrarye, In that muche grauelye hee thus conceaued, The Churche to bee founde of suche duplycitee Her credyte thearbye myght bee bereaued, And schismys taryse by muche enormytee; Whearfore hee wolde not in anye degree In this vrgent mateir graunte his consent, So myght bee obteyned no Dyuorsment. Walter, supposinge his purpose to haue sped, The tyme of his messengers passage to Rome To Grafton Maner his Progresse he dressed, Till they (in this case) brought hym the Popys dome. So into Northamptonsheere hee did come, The nwe Merqueses withe hym in like case Withe huntynge pastyme themselfys to solace. The goode sealy Grysilde was thear also, Withe muche heauye harte and pyteful cheare, Not in estate as she was wonte to go But oute of fauour, she standynge á reare, Ofte secreatlye sheadynge manye á salte teare, Withe ynwarde sighyngis fecht from the harte roote, For that whiche (vtterlye) was then no boote. At her wolde Walter caste no chearful looke, Nor she durste approache near to his presence; Hee cowlde her not in anywise then brooke, Nor she (as Queene) to woorke anye pretence, But, as an abiecte, standinge in scilence, Geauynge attendaunce, withe harte sore pyned, To what ordre she shoulde be assigned. Thoughe heauynes her harte did ouer loade For tomuche vnkyndenes shewde to the same, In perfecte charitee shee alwayes aboade, And thanked God howe eauer it dyd frame, Withe wisedome frayltee thus ofte to blame, Howe eache true Christyan it dothe behooue To suffre trobles for Christys deere looue. Asmuche as she myght she kepte her selfe close Within her chamber in oratyon, In whiche her desyre and vtter purpose To God she had in commendation, As to ordre to His contentation, Confirmynge her selfe withe all obeysaunce To His pleasure and dyuyne ordynaunce. At whiche selfe season the Cardynall then Attended on the Cowrte theare witheout fayle, Not in pompe withe his numbre of men, But as a dogge that had brent his tayle; Illucke began hym then faste to assayle, Theare fewe or none had hym oughtys in respecte, But was as one in maner cleane abiecte. Noforse whye wolde he goode Grysilde despite, He sped the woorse (I dare saye) for her sake; Whoe enuyethe the goode, God will hym requyte Withe some mysfortune; example I take At theis Dauythes woordys, “Whoe diggethe a lake Oother thearin (vngodlye) to entrappe, Is take in the same by sodayne myshappe.” So this saide Cardynall lyttle before Practiced goode Grysilde for to depose, And nowe of hym selfe hee can saye no more But is as like his owne honoure to lose, Of whome ferdre I shall somewhat disclose (By honest credyble information) Howe hee fell into trybulation. Twoe causes theare weare as I haue herde tell That greatly made to his confusion: A certayne younge lorde in his Cowrte dyd dwell Whoe shewed pretence to this conclusion, (Whyther of earnest, other illusion, The veary certayntee scace saye I can) For to haue macht withe the ladye Anne. His lorde (the Cardynall) as hee thearof knwe He raged withe hym outragyouslye, Protestinge he shoulde his entreprise rwe If eauer he herde hym vse her companye; This was before she was ordayned ladye; Whiche from her knowledge was not kept secret, Whearfore longe tyme she muche ynwardlye fret. Thother occasion was (as is saide) this: When Walter on her dyd firste caste his mynde, He asked the Cardynall what his aduyse is, Whoe answearde hym, as after [s]he dyd fynde, She was not for hym in anye maner kynde, Vnlesse for Concubyne he wolde her take, But as his Queene her clearlye to forsake. Of whiche twoe thynges as she had knowledginge, Nowe that she is aduaunced vp so hye, She hathe them daylye in her remembringe, And the Cardynall hated moste spitefullye; So dyd also Walter, ye well maye espye, At the Merqueses secreat perswasion, For he was nowe cleane out of estymation. And ymmedyatlye after this Progresse He was called to a Computation, Wheare, of his juellys, treasure and rychesse, Was to Walter made resignation; After whiche great extreme purgation To Yorke (his See Churche) dymytted he was; His caryage was eased, he myght lightlye passe. Yeat ere that he came to the sayde cytee (Throughe what occasion I cannot well saye) He was sent after, withe great velocytee, Towardys the Cowrte to haiste hym furthe waye, Whiche sodayne nues put hym in mortall fraye; Notwithestandinge, withe muche trobeled harte, Backwardys to Lecestre he dyd reuert. In whiche journeyinge by the wayes (doubtles) Hee tooke certayne pyllys, his stomake to purge, Replenysched withe greuous heauynes For this sodayne tempestyous surge, Rysinge (as he thought) throughe the Merqueses grudge; So that of necessytee by the waye He tooke restynge at Lecestre Abbaye; Wheare, thorowe woorkynge of the said peelys, (Whiche, as I herde tell, weare too too manye) And thorowe sorowe, hymselfe he theare feealys His life to forgoe witheoute all remeadye; No longe was the tyme while he dyd theare lye, Not passinge eyght dayes at the veary moste, Tyll he was foarsed to yealde vpp the goste. Before he departed, right Christyanlye He sent for the Pryor and was confest, The Euchariste moste reuerentlye Receauynge into his penytent brest, Askynge God mercye withe harte moste earnest For that (in his tyme) by will, deade and thought, Agaynste His goodnes he had eauer myswrought. And to signyfie that hee was penytent, Certaynlye, the Pryor I herde thus saye, A shurte of heare was his indument Next to his bodye, when he thear deadde laye; For whome hartelye it behoaueth to praye, Sithe hee heere ended so penytentlye, To whome (no doubte) God grauntethe His mercye. What thoughe he lyued muche remyssyuelye, Farre oute of the trade of his profession, Yeat dyinge (as hee dyd) penytentlye, His sowle (no doubtys) hathe heauyns ingression By hauynge in harte vycis suppression; For, thoughe mannys life bee neauer so infecte, God (speciallye) his ende dothe respecte. Some he callethe in their enteringe estate, Some (certaynlye) in their adolescence, Some at the terme of their decrepyte date, As this Cardynall, so departed hense: Yeat, hoapynge of age, let none woorke offense, Myndynge at that tyme his synnes to forgoe, Leste deathe hym preuent ere hee can doo soe. As happe hathe happened, pytee it was That oute of fauour sodaynly he went Before he (fynally) had brought vnto passe His entred purpose, so passinge excellent, His College in Oxforde, it may well bee ment, Witheout (as it shewthe) the full perfection, Of whiche I shall tell the cause of erection. Caput 7. The Occasion of the Erection of Christys Churche yn Oxforde by the Cardynall Thomas Wolsaye, the numbre of the woorke ffowlke, what he theare pretended; Of Doctor Cockes (Deane of the same) moste dyuyllische disorderynge theare and of his also despoysinge [sic] the saide Churche and other in Oxforde to the mayntaynaunce of his fylthy and vyle carnalyte. At tyme when this man in highe fauour stoode, Walter withe hym tawlkynge famylyarly, A certayne gentleman withe muche sobre moode (As then a suetor) stoode theare á looif by, On whome as Walter that tyme caste hys iye, He asked hym, withe countynaunce benynge, If that withe hym then hee wolde any thynge; To whome the partye thus entred his sute, Beseachinge his grace to graunte his lycence A scholar of his, his schoole heere to permute Beyonde the seayes, to dooe his dyligence, For more acquyringe, by studyes pretence, Of lyterat knowledge for yeares twoe or thre, The habler after to serue his Maistee. At whois contemplation Walter furthewaye Condescended to his humble request, And to the Cardynall hee theare did saye, “I merueyle whye oure folke are so earnest Their youthe beyonde seaye to haue enterest, To the consumynge of oure Royalmes treasure; Haue wee not Scloolys [sic] them at whome to recure?” “Syr,” (quoth the Cardynall) “pleasethe it your grace Me to assiste in that I dooe pretende, I shall so woorke in conuenyent space As faste hitherwardys to cause them descende As eauer thitherwardys they did themselfes bende, And oother also of eache Christian porte For the like purpose hyther to resorte.” “My Lorde,” (quoth Walter) “furdre your pretence, Whiche is (I perceaue) some studye to begyn, And yee shalbee sure of oure assistence, What waies so eauer yee thynke beste thearyn.” Vpon whiche occasion hee dyd not lyn (The plot deuysed and curyouslye caste) To set thearwithe in hande wondreslye faste. Moste cunnynge woorkemen theare weare prepared, Withe spediest ordynaunce for eauery thynge, Nothynge expedyent was theare oughtis spared That to the purpose myght bee assistynge; One thynge (chieflye) this was the hynderynge, The woorkefolke for lacke of goode ouerseers Loytered the tyme, like false tryfelers. They weare thus manye, á thousande (at the leaste), That thearon weare woorkeynge still daye by daye, Their paymentes contynued, their labours decreaste, For welneare one haulfe did noughtis els but playe. If they had trulye done that in them laye By so longe space as they weare tryfelynge, At his fall had beene lyttle to dooynge. The warke was wondreful passinge curyous, And tomuche set furthe to his vayne glorye; Tomuche it cannot bee to gloryous To His honour that reignethe eternallye; Thother preferred, that beeynge layde by, The warke cannot take prosperous successe; Of the godlye I take thearyn wytnes. Theare shoulde haue beene reade within that precyncte, (To thinstruction of all that thither came), The seauyn Scyencies seryously lynkte, As in their ordres the Schoolemen can name; The Readers to haue beene men of great fame, The picked purest throughe all Christiandome, If meede or monaye myght cause them to come. But, howe eauer it was, Goddys ayde theare did lacke, It had not els quayled, as yt shewethe yeete; That Pryde thearyn hathe oughtys hyndered backe I truste Humylytee shall perfectlye compleete, To set vpp Goddys howse, as mee seemethe meete, For His inestymable beneuolence Shewde (of His grace) to her magnyficence; Oure noble Queene Marye it is that I meane, Whoe, as shee is moste nobleste nowe of all, That noble warke not yeat fynysched cleane, Noblelye God graunte her to make yt formall, To His honour and glorye speciall: Her other affayres firste brought to goode fyne, God (throughe His grace) her harte thearto inclyne. Pytie it weare but it should goe forwarde: To furdre learnynge is merytoryous; By learnynge, to all that liste not bee frowarde, Is knowne to please the Lorde moste gratyous, And to all sortys what duetyes becumethe vs; So that to thearof the true mayntaynaunce All (to their powres) ought to dooe furtheraunce. So haue wee heere saide the cause orygynall Howe Frydiswide howse a Studye became, By the great traueyle of the Cardynall, Whois sowle God sheelde from the infernall flame, And prospere in vertue the Studentes of the same; They indeauorynge so, vertuouslye, No doubte to Goddys pleasure shall muche edyfie. Well I consydre (symple thoughe I bee) What worthie graces dothe learnynge ensue; Withoute learnynge and dwe cyuylytee Man is not hable hymselfe to rescue; Learnynge, whoe dothe yt perfectlye indue, To eache degre, of all maner a sute, Their pertyculars can well distrybute. Learnynge in causes to God appertaynynge (Whiche Reason transcendethe) can saye and perswade, Howe by true Faithe Man haue muste his aydinge, And not by Reason in althyngys to wade; Learnynge inducethe the vearye true trade, To distrybution, as I note can, Of all that is due bothe to God and man. Then, worthye is learnynge of preferment And of all degreeis to bee magnyfied, For learnynge rendrethe the lowe excellent, And the excellent wyttye to bee tryed; Learnynge and wisedome togeathers allyed, As freendys and kynne of consanguynytee, They neadys shall woorke to muche vtylitee, Admyxted withe grace, I meane, as nolesse, For Scyence, Saincte Paule saithe, the mynde doth inflate; Of Scyence hathe manye had plentyousnes And voyde of Grace hathe proued farre ingrate, Vsynge their learnynge after dyuylische rate, Of Doctor Cox.As Doctor Cockes, withe á Combe thearto sett, Throughe fleschelye folye cawght in the Dyuyllis nett. Whois noysome, cursed, and dyuyllische subuertinge, By hym, as in his vttermuste powre laye, Of godlye ordre, althyngis consyderynge, From that was goode to the contrarye waye, I can none other wise of conscience saye, To Vertue hee was an vtter enemye, As (to his shame) his factes dothe testifye. Abhorrynge his ordre of sacrede Preeistehod, A whoare hee tooke hym, wife cowlde he take none, For contrarye vowe hee made vnto God When of His Mynysters hee tooke to bee one; But for hee wolde not to the Dyuyl alone, Hee wrought (by all meanys) other to entrappe, Withe hym (for eauer) to cursse their myshappe. Hee wrought by his holye stynkeinge Martyr Peter, the stynking Martyr. Peter, that Paule his breathe cowlde not abyde, (For that, like Sathans true knyght of the Gartyr, His holye doctryne hee heere falcyfide) That whoe (of Preeistes) in maryage was not tyde Hee was afflicted, tormoyled and toste, To losse of lyuynge or some other coste. Somuche abhorred this vagynge verlet All signes of godlye conuersation, That wheareso a preeiste withe shauen crowne he met Hee shooke hym vppe withe detestation, And in Oxforde his ordynation Was, whoeso theare a crowne on hym dyd sytt, His College he shoulde for his crownys sake amytt. This was á worthie famous Doctor, This was á man worthie of preamynence, This was á Christian true Professor, This was á man of right intelligence; The Dyuyl hee was! I saye my conscience, He was (I saye) an erraunt cursed Theeif; His actys declare, yee neade no ferdre preeif. Hee robbed the Churche of Frydyswis (I saye) Of Chalyces, Crosses, Candylstickes withe all, Of syluer and gylte, bothe preacious and gaye, Withe Coapis of tyssue and many a riche Pall, Dedycat to God aboue æternall; And other Collegis maye hym well cursse, For thorowe hym they are farre yeat the wursse. Hee was choase Chauncellor for fawtes amendinge; Hee mended (indeade) from goode to the badde! Hee was a Chauncellor of the Dyuyls sendinge, Neauer was Towne that suche an other hadde; So made hee ordynaunce, that á prowde ladde Withe men right reuerende myght shewe hym checkmate, And went dysguysed yn ruffyan rate. Hee set them all cleane oute of discyplyne, And sawe them setteled in heynous heresye; Hee let them (at will) wickedlye inclyne, He nothynge to vertue dyd edyfie, But what to goode ordre was contrarye; So wrought hee, that (trulye), to make reporte, As the Deane was, so weare the more sorte. So I wische not Frydiswise to florische In sorte as that Cox example theare lefte, But true ordre of Scholars taccomplische, Of whiche (wyckedlye) he sawe them berefte, Suchewise indued and withe grace fullye fefte As, nowe I theare noate, by signes I doo see; I wische their furtheraunce the moste that maye bee. Cap. 8. Walter fynyschynge his Progresse, passinge thorowe Thame, and other Townys, the newe Merqueses faste by his syde, what mutteringe the people had on Grisildis partye and for her doughter Mary. The Messengers reuerte from Rome without Dyuorsement; Walter (by a wycked man) was moued to take vpon hym the Supreamacye ouer the churche of Englande. For all our tedious and longe dygression, We have not forgote oure former pretence; Walters pleasure fulfilled at Grafton To Buckingehamsheere he dreste hym from thense, At Ixill, before the deeare fell to offense, To fynysche that tyme his huntynge season, For Holye Roode Daye was then paste and gone. From thense wheare hee came, faste iumpe by his syde, Accompayned hym the ladye Anne Bullayne, All pleasaunte, fresche and gallaunt that tyde, Goode Grysilde followinge, as one of her trayne, At whiche manye (that wise weare) did disdayne So noble á woman to bee forsake, And in her steade so meane á thinge to take. For thorowe Thame, that gentle Merket Towne, The Kynge then issued vpp to Londonwarde, Wheare dyuerse and manye their headys henge downe; To see the case, withe Grysilde howe it farde, Vnto their hartys, God wote, it went full harde, And thus did saye, mutteringe as they stoode still, “Christe saue goode Grysilde to His blessed will.” “O Lorde!” (they saide, togeathers as they stoode), “What meauethe our Kynge goode Grysilde to forgoe, Whiche hym heere followethe withe trobled moode, That better for her weare she weare ferdre froe? In his solacinge shee feelethe but woe; Whoe can her chalenge or blame in the case, Shee to followe an other in her place? “Shee (blessed womon, God comforte her harte!) Hathe beene full godlye and louynge withe all, And her behaued in eauerye parte Moste honorablye, bothe to great and small, And nowe her honour thus wise to appall! To speake in the case wee maye nother dare, Yeat pytee it weare shee shoulde oughtes mysfare. “What hathe she transgreste to bee thus caste owte, A Queene (of bloode) so excellent as shee? Of her behauyour none neadethe to dowbte; Some bale is bruynge, what eauer it bee; Straunge is this sight whiche wee heere nowe see, A Queene moste royall to come all behynde, And so meane before; this gothe oute of kynde. “Well, well,” (they saide) “God graunte all proue well! Wee feare some straunge nues shall after ensue: If so á kynge maye his wife thus repell, (So goode á woman and full of vertue), Of weddelocke joynynge farewell then, adue! This example, if it thorowly frame, Shall other ensence to practice the same. “If their unytinge had beene thought wrongefull, Whie so longe tyme contynued haue they? His Father (of witt and wisedome not dull) What myght, and myght not, before did purveye. Prospered togeathers they hathe many á daye, And wee in wealthe and muche tranquyllytee; This is noughtys els but Mannys fragylytee. “This is noughtis els but Mannys sensuall mynde; God graunte wee all haue not cause to repent! Let hym not looke á newe better to fynde, Reason withe reasonable ought bee content. Fye! that at that age Man shoulde bee insolent! For, without all maner of suspection, This is begone of carnall affection. “Wheare is become sage Discretion as nowe, In suche noble Peearys that ought to frequent? Wheare is vnto God his duetye, as howe To haue in awe His holy commaundement? Thoughe hee it let slippe in his inwarde entent, Hee muste and shall make answeare in the case When powre, nor selfe wyll, shall rowte in the place. “God graunte hee (cheeiflye) repent not this geare, For neadys it muste breede great inconuenyence, Thoughe whiche wayes wee knowe not, howe, when, or wheare; The soare of this passethe oure intellygence. For Dauyths trespace, opprest withe pestylence, Thousandys of his abode the affliction: Synne, sore of Kyngis, stoorthe Goddys malediction. “But sithe his affection is nowe so sett, And the mateir so earnestlye begoone, Wee (poore Subjectes) maye it in nowise let, But feele it wee shall, by althynges bee doone; Rasche recheles lust his race will neadys roone, Like cowlte vnbrydeled, reason depryued, Throughe shame (in fyne) moste straungely disguysed.” Suche, of the rude and pooare Comynaltee, Was (secreatlye) their tawlke and whisperinge, Whoe vnto Grysilde beeare loue and feualtie Withe all that in their pooare hartys was lyinge; And ferdre, they had this careful sayinge, “Halas! if Walter goode Grysilde denye, What shall become of her doughter Marye? “What shall become of that pryncely Flowre That all this Royalme hathe joyed so longe yn? Shee shall forgoe then her Pryncely honoure; The weyes thearvnto wee see dothe begyn. None only but God maye oother grace wynne; For Mother and Doughter what shall beetyde? Wee can but praye Christe for them to prouyde.” This of one Towne was not only the tawlke, Or of one Countie, Cytee, or Burrowe, But comonlye, wheare eauer men did waulke, This noble Royalme (in maner) cleane thorowe, So deepe in their hartys it graued furrowe; For they of wyttie consyderation Feared tensue great dyssipation. But what aduayled their tawlke in this case? It dyd their goode wyllis but as signyfie; The mateir dyd then but pause for a space, Tyll from Rome the Messengers myght them hye; Walter, nowe setteled wheare he wolde lye, His expectation (daylye) then was To heeare nues, howe his purpose came to passe. By this the Messengers to the Cowrte came, Voyde of the purpose for whiche they weare sent: So soone as Walter vndrestoode the same, For malencolye hee ynwardelye brent, And was (throughe malice) moste earnestlye bent Agaynste the Busshope for sayinge hym naye, Ragynge as lyon depryued his praye. At whiche selfe season one certayne stoode by, Whois name (thoughe I herde) I will not expresse, Whoe saide to Walter, muche coragyouslye, “What shoulde this mateir oughtes vex your highnes? Ye maye (witheoute doubtinge) it clearlye redresse; Sithe yee are heere Kynge and lorde of this lande, Yee dooynge youre lyfte, whoe dare youe withestande? “Yee, takynge on youe the Supreamacye As headde of the Churche ouer all Brytayne And other youre Domynyons specyallye, Yee maye (at pleasure) then althinges ordayne, So foreauermore Rome Cowrte to refrayne; If yee not sticke to put this in practice, Whoe is that dare denye youre entreprise?” Walter this heearynge his harte can reuyue, Callynge to hym of his Counsell the cheeif, For the saide mateir withe speede to contryue That hee weare quyeted oute of his greeif; The thynge by Perlyament putten in preeif, It was condescended after his mynde, None durste say naye but Deathe hee liste to fynde. Cap. 9. Walter sendethe to Oxforde to haue his case discussed, John Longelande (Busshoppe of Lincolne) his cheif Commyssioner, Fryer Nicholas Defendaunte in the same, Fyue Inceptours, Doctors, (withe sundry other) specially withestandinge thearin, wheare Women shewed them selfes on Grysildys Partye; Thunyuersiteis Seale (by stealthe) goaten; And what myseryes ensued. Yeat, for that Walter wolde not be thought (Of headye poure) to woorke contrariouslye, Hee sent to Oxforde, as playnnes he sought, To haue his case theare tryed by the Clergie, At whiche trauelynge certaynlye was I, Attendynge vpon a certayne goode man, Whearfore in the same I somewhat saye can. Thither was sent as cheeif Commyssioner The Busshoppe of Lincolne, one John Langelande, Withe certayne other that well cowlde flatter, The learned judgment theare to vndrestande, Wheare one Fryer Nycholas took muche in hande, As cheeif Defendaunte in the foresaide case, Whoe fownde hym selfe macht euyn to the harde face. But theare was vsed no indifferencye; Suche as by learnynge made against the Kynge They weare redargued moste cryellye, Threatened alsoe to forgoe their lyuynge; On thother syde, all thearto inclynynge They had highe chearinge withe meede otherwaye; Falsehod tryumphinge, Truthe quakynge for fraye. That tyme an Acte theare shoulde haue gone forwarde, Wheare Seauyn famous Clarkes that Inceptors weare Bycause (in this case) Fyue wolde not drawe towarde, It was dyfferred, to their heauye cheare, For that their cheeif freendys weare presentlye theare, Mawdelaye, Mooreman, Holyman also, Mortimer, Cooke, withe other Twoe moe. Theis Fyue in nowise wolde graunte their consentes, The Regent Maisters weare of the same mynde; Rather, they graunted to forgoe howse and rentes Then weetinglye so to showe them selfes blynde; The Proctors, for gaynes they hoaped to fynde, (Throughe frendeshippe they made) obteyned the grace Of Busshoppe Langlande the Acte to take place. The mateir longe tyme theare hangynge in suspense, Witheoute hauynge Thunyuersiteis seale As to confyrme Walters foresaide pretence, For whiche the Busshoppe harde threatnynges did deale, To his reproache, and hynderaunce of goode heale; If so that some theare had had hym at large, I wolde of his life haue taken no charge. For on the outegatys wheare hee by nyghtes laye Wear Roapes faste nayled, withe Gallowes drawne by, To this entent, as a man myght well saye “If wee so myght, suche weare thye Destynye.” His seruauntes ofte handeled accordynglye, As, one (indeade) makynge water at a wall A stone (right heauye) on hym one let fall. Women (that season) in Oxforde weare busye, Their hartes weare goode, it appeeared nolesse; As Fryer Nicholas chaunced to come by, “Halas!” (saide some) “that we myght this knaue dresse, For his vnthankefull daylye busynes Againste oure deeare Queene, good Grysilidis; Hee shoulde euyl to cheeaue, he sholde not sure mysse.” Withe that, a woman, (I sawe it trulye,) A lumpe of osmundys let harde at hym flynge: Whiche myste of his noddle, the more pytie, And on his Fryers heelys it came trytelynge, Whoe (sodaynly), as hee it perceauynge, Made his complaynte vpon the women so, That thirtye the morowe weare in Buckerdo. Theare they contynued three dayes and three nyghtes, Till woorde was sent downe from Walter the Kynge, Whoe fret at the harte, as vexed withe sprytes, That Grisildys parte they weare so tenderynge, To all that so dyd, this woorde downe sendynge, That, magre their teeathes, hee wolde haue his furthe, And ere longe tyme make some of them small wurthe. But yeat for all that the Fyue foresaide Clarkes, Withe moste of the Regent Maisters, that tyde, For all the threatnynges that flaterers barkes From that was the right they wolde nowhit slyde. The Busshoppe Langelande dyd thus then prouyde, A Conuocation of certayne to call, And gote the Seale as consented of all. For whiche was weepinge and lamentation, I was then presente and herde their complaynte: “Halas!” (they saide), “in pyteful fashyon Nowe is goode Oxforde for eauer attaynte! Thowe that haste florisched art become faynte! Thowe weare vnspotted till this present daye, Withe truthe euermore to holde and to saye. “But notwithestandinge, consyderinge as thus, Thoue weare withe powre and myght ouerlayde, Thoue thearfore remaynyste innoxius, As dothe (by vyolence) the rauysched mayde. Eaueriche his duetye on eache pate bee payde, That is, whoe of vs hathe wronged the right, God to their desertes their dooynges requyte. “This to this ende wee put in remembraunce, To the knowledge of oure posterytee, That all, that season, made not dyssemblaunce, But tenne to one stucke to the verytee, But cheife that ought had no syncerytee; False Ambition and Keepynge yn fauour Declared in this muche lewde behauour.” In this mateir is to bee adnoted What euyl counsell withe Pryncys maye induce, For, consequentlye, this Royalme was sorted, As water breakynge ouer hedde or sluce: All goode ordres weare cleane set oute of vse, Suche calamyteis ensuynge theare vpon, To this Royalmys neare subuersion. Then florisched Flatery tryumphantlye, Then Falsehod beeare rule, and Truthe set á syde, Then weare the goode maligned throughe enuye, Then was true Meekenes ouercome withe Pryde, Then to perdition all Goodenes faste hyde, Then was Selfe wyll cheif Ruler ouer all, Then myght, in right, none for Aduocat call. Then of the Churche began thaffliction, Then entred Heresies cursed and nought, Then encreased Goddys malediction, Then His due honour in great decaye brought, Then the goode not regarded as they ought, But euery Ribaulde myght them checke and chace; The Goode depryued, the Badde in their place. In earthe they cowlde not their malice extende, But vnto heuen shewed indignation; The holye Saynctys theare they dyd discommende By too too muche abomynation, Sclaunderinge certayne vndre this faschion, Howe holye Virgyns, of no lyttle some, Weare Concubynes to the Busshoppe of Rome. The gloryous perpetuall Virgyn Marye No better esteamed then an other woman; Eache doungegell as goode as the Sanctuarye; Theis myscheifes, withe hundredefolde moe, began At the incummynge of this nwe Queene Anne, Whoe, as she was, declared at the laste, Whome God vanysched withe muche sodayne blaste. As good and blessed inducethe Vertue, And woorkethe all meanys to mayntayne the same, So the malignaunte dothe Vertue subdue, Bycause their doyngis shee dothe fierslye blame; Prooif whoe so notethe, Vice endethe withe shame. Then was no wondre this alteration To breede great meanys of desolation. For, certaynlye, vpon this induction Entred in this Royalme suche innouation (To the pooare mannys vttre destruction), Raysinge of Rentes in wondreful fashion, From one to fyue in ful numeration, To cawsynge of dearthe in vytayl and warys, Withe other sundrye ineuytable carys, Somuche the bodye not heere molestynge, But hundredfolde more endaungeringe the sowle; At Fastynge and Prayinge was made but iestinge, The vile Ignoraunte the Clarke to controwle, All holye cerymonyes coniuringe the Mowle, Eache cockynge Cobler and spittyllhowse Proctor In learnynge taken so goode as the Doctor. In tokne yeat more of Infidelytee, Downe went the Crosses in eauerye countraye, Goddys servauntes vsed withe muche crudelytee, Dysmembred (like beastes) in thopen highe waye, Their inwardys pluckte oute and hartis wheare they laye, In suche (moste greuous) tyrannycall sorte That to to shamefull weare heere to reporte. Shortelye after, to mende the mateir more, Churches and Monasteries downe they went, To haue the treasure speciallye thearfore, Althoughe they fayned for other entent, After this Prouerbe, to like consequent, The Glouer (craftelye) brought this reason yn, The Dogge to bee madde, all to haue his skynne. Yeat this was not the vttremuste euyl; Theye nybbed Christes faithe after their pleasure, So weare they ledde by their Maister the Deuyl, For, on the truthe, they lyed oute of measure: The whoale heere to wright I haue no leasure, But to this ende I haue rehersed this, What came by exchaunge of good Grisilidis. Caput 10. Walter sendethe to Grysilde to resigne vp her Crowne, whiche she neauer wolde graunte; Of her wondrefull and wyttye answeare; She is secluded the Cowrte; What complaynte she made for her Doughter Mary, and of her greeif for her Mother agayne; Howe Walter wolde bee seene to dooe vpryghtly, and all vnrightlye (in this case) hee wrought. Walter presented withe Thunyuersiteis Seale, Seemynge to hym all had condescended, The mearyer that daye he made his ful meale, Nowe had hee althynges as hee pretented. Forwardys hee went, hee was not defended, The goode sealye Grysilde for to put downe, And in her steade his nwe mynyon to crowne. At Brydewell (his place) that season hee laye, And theare was also goode Grysilidis; Thoughe in his presence shee came nyght nor daye, Shee muste theare attende, his pleasure so is; To whome hee sent then, by certayne of his, Her Crowne to resigne, of foarse shee els sholde, Whiche playne shee denyed, vse her as hee wolde. Shee saide, to hym she was true wedded Wife, All Christendome ouer can wytnes the same, So wolde shee acknowledge duryinge her life, Howe eauer otherwise hee pleased her to name; As for his owne Royalme, for feare they did frame To the fulfillinge of his fixed mynde, Witheout respectinge what Conscience dothe bynde. Shee added, his Father was thought man of wytt And wyttelye he wrought; whoe liste, his actys vue; All Christian Clergye alowed them to knytt; If they vnknytt them, she wolde yt not rue; But vntill suche tyme she wolde contynue, Witheoute consentynge to resignation, Howeeauer hee beeare her his indignation. Ferder then so, she merueyled greatlye They lyuynge so longe in looue and vnytee, And was withe her pleased, as dyd signyfie, Till latelye, what eauer the cause shoulde bee, She hym obeyinge withe all humylytee, Also neauer dyd, other pretended, Whearwithe his courage myght bee offended. Or if she had beene an Adulteresse,— Of whiche all the worlde cowlde her not accuse; She was towardys hym knytt withe all stedfastnes, Withowte (in that kynde) anye maner bruse, Whearfore the more it made her to muse So noble a man, so wyttie withe all, Into suche an opynyon to fall;— Or if hee cowlde saye, or anyman els, That owghtys for her sake hee had mysfared, In his propre Royalme or owtewarde trauels;— But God for hym had freendelye prepared As in his affayres neauer oughtys squared, By mysaduenture, to greeif of his Estate;— Then cause myght seeme her to bee repudiat. For in Adultery whoe so ioynethe, Hee maye bee sure to bee infortunat; No luckye successe God hym assignethe, But is withe myscheeifes manye intricat; So hathe not (throughe her) happened hym euyl fate, But tryumphauntly, in pryncelye degree, Florischinge in wealthe and felycitee. Concernynge the sterylnes layde vnto her, It was witheout reason, discretion or skyll; She had, and moe myght, thorowe due order, Haue borne and brought furthe, to answeare theartyll; But luste at lykynge his luste dyd fulfyll: (Meanynge, hee elswheare dispersed his seede, Whearfore God wolde not more seade to proceede.) So made she answeare, this noble woman, At sendynge to her her Crowne to resigne, Withe muche moe reasons then I rehearse can, For she was lyghtened withe grace dyuyne; But by no maner meanys she wolde inclyne Her Crowne to surrendre for weale or woe, Thoughe Walter neauer maligned her so. Whiche answeare, as Walter dyd vndrestande, Hee tooke the mateir muche furyouslye; As one that had all the lawe in his hande, Hee wolde her ordre as cause hee sawe whye; Commaunde then did hee, in his fell furye, Oute of his Cowrte theare she sholde be conueyde To wheare he assigned, theare to bee steyde. So was goode Grysilde secluded the Courte, Assigned (as Warde) whyther to resorte; Yeat worste thynge of all, whiche did her moste hurte, Her deareste Doughter from her was holden shorte; One myght not an other (in care) comforte; The Mothers harte somuche it dyd not byte, But (trulye) the Doughters it did as deadly smyte. “O Lorde,” ofte sayde this godlye Grysilde, Withe tearys (nodoubtys) of ynwarde pensyuenes, “Wolde to God my Walter weare thus well wylde My Doughter and his, that is as Pryncesse, That I myght see her, to ease my dystresse; Thoughe he so farre liste to bee ouerthwarte, She weare ynoughe to recomforte my harte. “She weare ynoughe to my contentation, That I myght see in state howe she dothe stand, Whyther shee bee in like trybulation, Caste oute of fauour, from state, goodys, and lande, As certaynly my mynde bearethe mee so in hande; Thoughe (peraduenture) not yeat as am I, I feare (ere longe hense) the Feendys fallacye. “I feare, and mystruste, for mee (her Mother) She shall (at all) fare nowhit the better; Thoughe God wolde none bee wronged for other, Muche sundrye wayes Sathan the goode can fetter; Whoe dare from eyther conueye oother letter, Though Reason and Nature wolde graunte theare till, Yeat false malignours wolde rayse thearof yll. “I am no Traytores, I let all men weeite, No more is my Marye, I dare protest; Wee are moste readye to all that is meeite; Whye then shoulde anye vs wrongefully moleste? Whye may not bee had this rightfull requeste, The Mother and Dowghter togeathers bothe twayne, Agreeued á like, theyr greefis to complayne? “I cowlde bee content, and shee (I dare saye), (If Walters goode will wolde graunte to the same) To lyue togeathers yn some pooare Nunraye, Praysinges to rendre to Goddys holye name, The quyeter to lyue, oute of this worldys blame; For, fye on this worldys highe Domynation Commyxte (in this sorte) withe trybulation! “Whye was I joyned to suche highe Estate, And thus repelled withe hate and disdayne? Whye not rather to some of meaner rate, That myght of mee (as I of hym) beene fayne? Whye thus it prouethe, what shoulde I complayne? Geeue mee my Doughter, I holde mee content; Wheare restethe the fawte God graunte amendement.” Suche complaynte (syttinge all solytarye) Goode Grysilde wolde ofte vnto herselfe make, Prayinge to God for her Doughter Marye, That Hee of her the gouernement wolde take; Muche was shee careful (in harte) for her sake, No Mother eauer was heere, oather yendre, That, more then she dyd, myght her childe tendre; Whoe at that season, as Pryncesse soueraigne, At Ludlowe kepte howseholde muche honorablye; Hearinge her Mothers vexation and payne, Vnto her harte it went moste passinge nye; Thoughe shee (deeare mayde) cowlde it not remeadye, She prayed nyght and daye, withe many a teare, The heauynlye Father to helpe in this geare. Shee saide, (as she speciall occasion had), “O myghtye Jesu, maker of althinge, My Mother, dolorous, pensife and sad, Thowe (in her sorowes) bee ay comfortinge, Turnynge the harte of my Father the Kinge Her otherwise (of gentlenes) tentreat, And not tafflicte her withe sorowes so great. “If (as dothe seeme) his purpose take effecte, To geeue her vpp, assumynge the other, Mee also withe her hee sure will reiecte, Aswell the Doughter as so the Mother. O God! sende helpe, the better the soner! Or, in Thye sight if it bee so decreed, Welcome thye will! I am right well agreed. “Welcome what wayes soeauer Thowe liste assigne! Beseachinge Thy magnyficent goodnes In nowise wee bothe oughtys to maligne (Throughe frayletye of mynde) for worldely distresse, But, to receaue it, all due meekenes, As sent by Thy dyuyne operation, For (as Thou knowiste) some consyderation.” Suche was this princelye maydyns prayer daylye; Somuche the Mother had her not in mynde But the Doughter asmuche her semblablye, So mutuallye wrought Nature of kynde; But Grisilde at Walter no fauour myght fynde, Reproched she was by vtter contempte, As from his fauour and companye exempte. Muche was in this case Walters solycitude He wolde bee seene all to frame vprightlye, And all vnrightlye he wrought to conclude; So was hee blynded in his fantazye, Hee was selfe mynded muche meruelouslye, So that on what thinge his mynde was onse sett, He wolde haue his furthe, he wolde haue no lett. Caput. 11. Walter commaundethe a Cowrte at Dunstaple wheare Grysilde was deposed from her estate; Of this worlde and signyfication of the same; Why Grysilde withstoode her Resignation, whoe was geauen to name Lady Douager; howe Pryncys, faylinge their Faithe, geauethe occasyon to other to dooe the like, for whiche this Royalme hathe beene (and is) moste greuously afflicted. Perceauynge as Walter did perfectly well Thansweare of Grisilde concernynge her Crowne, No worthynes had beene her to compell, Whiche, weyinge and ponderinge, made hym to frowne, Yeat neadys (withe speede) he wolde haue her put downe, Althoughe witheoute reason, skyll or offense; Shee was not hable to make resistence. Immedyatlye then ensuynge all this A Cowrte he assigned at Dunstaple, To whiche was summoned goode Grysilidis To make suche answeare as shee was hable; But what thearyn was oughtes profitable? Howe muche goode right she eauer did disclose, Hee was at á poyncte to haue his purpose. Theare at that Cowrte was tossinge and turnynge, To small goode effecte wheare right ys compelled, For durynge the tyme of the Judgis soiurnynge At goode Grysilde they greuouslye swelled; What so herselfe or her Proctours telled, It was witheoute all estymation, The mateir had earste determynation. The mateir was earste decised as thus, Anne Bullayne Grysildys place to supplye, And Grysilde to Walter repudius Bycause she was not pleasinge to his iye; What shoulde they then lenger tyme occupye? Judgement followed, before contryued, So was goode Grysilde her place depryued. So was the goode and godlye reiected, For that to this worlde she was not pleasinge; So was the other in place elected, Bycause to this worlde she was contentinge: The worlde louethe his, by Christys owne tellinge, And his enemyes hathe in illusion, As heere nowe prouethe the conclusion. This worlde is bothe blynde and phantasticall, Fycle and false in all his practycinges, Inconstante, muche praue, and perylous withe all, Of whiche to bee ware wee haue great warenynges, Hee so deceauethe by sundrye compasinges; Whois notoryous reprehensible state To certayne entent wee shall dyuulgat. The Worlde is the People, it is no leasinge, The greater parte, by innumerable sorte, Geauen to peruerse and wrongeful dealinge, Farre oute of trade whiche Goddys truthe dothe exhorte, To lye, to sclaunder, to gawde, and to sporte, To fleschlye also abomynation, Withe other meanys of muche deceptation. Takinge to name Worlde of the People so, Bycause all worldelye their fashions dothe frame, Of whiche said Worlde the Dyuyl (our mortall foe) Is cheif Capytayne, Christe grauntinge the same, “The Prynce of this Worlde, in his furyous flame, Commethe to seeke lucre, in Mee hathe hee none;” For Hee was not of this Worldys condytion. Nomore was this godly Grysilde trulye, In worldelye pleasures shee had no delyte, Aboue, the heauynlye Mansion on hye, Was firmelye fixed her whoale appetyte; Thearfore this Worldys Prynce had her in despyte, And, at his cursed exitation, The Worlde did her all this vexation. What more vexation myght vex her harte Then wrongefullye so entreated to bee, Deposed (as to saye) from her dwe parte? Not seene the like, in suche nobilitee, So highe, to descende to lower degree, Onlye by surmysed inuasion; No small thearfore her greefes occasion. Whye shee withestoode or made resistence, And was not willinge her state to forgoe, Consyderinge farre higher preamynence For wronges susteynynge belonge suche vnto, She for this cause did specyallye so, In right to stande behouethe all and some, Euyn vntill Deathe the life dothe ouercome. Another as this vndrestande wee maye; Shee (beeinge á woman of great prudencye) Consydered, in her Deposition laye Daungers occulted, open to her iye, Destruction of Christys Sanctuarye Withe hundred other calamyteis mo, If shee her Estate reiected weare fro. Shee sawe Newfanglenes entred her foote And was withe Walter famyliar to muche, Also Heresye, of myscheif the roote, Newes to induce that dyd the quycke tuche, In sorte (as to saye) moste horryble, suche That, if they weare not (in tyme) resisted, To late shoulde bee to haue them desisted. For that, (like woman of godlye meanynge), Shee was moste lothe her Estate to auoyde, Consyderinge as howe parties weare leanynge This Royalme thearbye to bee sorelye anoyde, Grace and Vertue, as creatures accloyde, Weare heauye and sadde, as laboringe withe greeif, For they themselfes sawe geauen ouer of the Cheif. In this to helpe and fynde some maner staye This mercyful Matrone manfullye stoode, Rather then womanlye to shrynke for fraye, Onlye of entent to dooe this Royalme goode, That from her olde dwe began to chaunge moode, As to chaunge honour, renowne and goode fame, For dishonour, folye and fleschelye shame. Suche was the meane of this godly woman, But God permytted the Dyuyl to take place As ofte Hee so dothe, probation prooue can, When wronge is suffred the right to oute chace; So oure desertes deserued in the case, That of this woman vnwoorthye wee weare, Whiche nowe at Dunstaple deposed was theare. Deposed shee was as seemed to the worlde, But shee exalted in fauour of the Highest; Of longe the wicked moste weywardely jorlde Tyll whome they mynded to Walter was nyghest; O wicked worlde! thoue wrongefullye wryest, So contrariouslye to affix thy looue! Note well heereafter what thearebye shall prooue. When so they had doone the thynge they came for, They gaue her to name Ladye Douager, A name lessenynge muche deale the honor That of forne promysse was due vnto her: From Faithe when Pryncys begynnethe to erre, Whiche other (their Subjectis) tobserue shoulde see, What, in that case, of right then judge maye wee? What is it but they the like will ensue? And so dyd sundrye, I feare not to tell, Gaue vpp their olde wyues and tooke them to nwe, Makynge as nothynge of Christys Gospell; A meanys that muche conduced vnto hell, Whiche, at the headys, example so takynge, Scace yeat at this daye hathe clearly slakynge. So weddelocke not shynethe as I wolde wische; God graunte some meanys of reformation! To muche Adultery dothe still florische, As thearin cheeif their delectation, Witheoute feare of Goddys indignation; I meane no small Byrdys of the symple sorte, As presidentes shewthe, dothe Rumor reporte. For whiche, and other abomynations, This noble Brytayne hathe beene plaged sore Withe sundrye and manye trybulations, I thynke no Royalme in Christendome more. Oure purpose otherwise tendinge, thearfore, Thearto accordinge, prosequute we shall, Till iuste occasion maye thearto befall. Caput 12. Grysilde depryued her honour was assigned too Bugden, the Busshoppe of Lincolns maneir, whoe was cheif mynyster of all her sorowes, whear sundrye her olde cheif officers and seruauntes weare commaunded from her; Of her lamentable taking her leaue at them, and of her greuous complaynynge for Walters vnkyndenes towardys her. This godly Grysilde depryued her place, To chaunge of cheeare not sole of her alone, (Whoe had cheif cause, consyderinge the case), But to the greeif also of manye á one, After her wrongefull Deposition She was (as warde) from place to place conueyde; Leaste to her comforte, theare was shee lengest steyde. Place had shee none of her owne to resorte, Rentes or Reuenues digne to her estate, Or oughtes that serued her speciall comforte, But beinge blanked as one all amate (As was no merueyle, serued in suche rate) Was commaunded to á place called Bugdayne In Huntingedone sheeare to reste and remayne; Whiche to the Busshoppe of Lyncolne dyd belonge, Whoe firste began her heauynes to broache, In á Sermon whearin hee waded wronge And stoored, whearbye the breache did approache; At hym takynge light manye dyd encroache, (For meede and promotion) that Walter myght Exchaunge good Grysilde and dooe but the right. Vndre his handys her greeifes they grewe muche, Whiche all to expresse shoulde seeme tedyous; Partely at Oxforde it was her chaunce suche, Partely at Dunstaple, as this dothe discusse, And nowe was sent to soiourne in his howse; Also he was, emonges other thynges all, The Executor of her Funerall. That, of all noatys that I dooe adnote Whiche hee (of his partye) to her did extende, Was cheiflye the best, I all men behote, For then weare her trobles brought to an ende: I wil not saye they dyd her thither sende For any coarsey vnto her stomake, As some (peraduenture) wolde it so take, But theare she was for á certayne season, Wheare this other affliction her befell, Which soundethe (me thynkethe) farre oute of reason, As one of her Seruauntes to mee did tell; Her Offycers, that longe withe her did dwell, Weare her auoyded for certayne entent, And newe assigned at Walters comaundement: At whois departure, when they tooke their leaue, At her (their olde and reuerende Mistresse) Tendrenes of harte her powres did bereaue, As tearys from the same did playnlye expresse, Sayinge vnto them in her great heauynes, “Halas! youre seruyce to mee of longe date, That I (no waies) can oughtes remunerat! “Halas! that (of forse) I neadys muste youe forgoe, And yowe also mee; no reamedye theare is; No lyttle thearfore is my inwarde woe! What shall me nowe betyde I wote not I wisse! Newe muste I neadys take; what meanethe by this But of my tyme heere the shorte abrydgement? Whoe cannot resiste muste holde her content. “What is it for mee, or other the like, Those to forgoe (my Seruauntes moste trustie) That in my cheeif neadys weare my whoale physike, By fyrme affyaunce that in them had I, All straunge and vnknowne their romethes to supplye? It mouethe mee my life haulfe to suspecte, Whither they are sent the same to infecte? “For well I perceaue and vndrestande maye, Some are that small passethe of my welfare; Weare I hense rapte to morowe or to daye, The shorter my tyme the lesse wolde they care. As abjecte, or thrall, they keepethe mee bare; And nowe of my Trustie depryuynge mee, What can they shewe of more extremytee? “But, for I muste neadys obedyent bee, I will in goode parte take as God shall sende, Prayinge youe hartelye to praye for mee, As I shall for youe vnto my lyues ende; And so to God I humblye youe commende.” Whearewithe, to certayne (withe many a salte teare) She gaue in rewarde of her wearynge geare. So departed they eyther from other, Withe muche heauye hartes as cheare dyd declare, Throughe whiche her ende approached the soner, As is a preparatyue Sorowe and Care; What thearto myght make, some liste not to spare; Ynowhe was her trybulation in vre, More then some euyn of the meanyste myght endure. Her sourgynge sorowes (certaynlye), I saye, So daylye encreaste by muche abundaunce, That thre yeares space, witheout any delaye, It had withe her á still contynuaunce; So was she plunged in peruerse peanaunce, As, in degre, estate withe payne to cownte, All greeis (of her gree) herse farre did surmounte. Emonges whiche all, this one did her sore payne, The Pooare to her repayringe for releeif, And them (as shee wolde) not hable to sustayne; It was to her an inwarde deadlye greeif, And to her enemyes á shameful repreeif So goode á woman, and noble withe all, To bee so vsed and holden in thrall. “Halas!” she wolde thus often tymes complayne Vnto her selfe muche lamentablelye, “Why dothe my Walter at mee thus disdayne, And I hym tenderinge, withe all feruencye, For hym my life to put in ieoberdye? No woman can wische her husbonde more well, Thoughe hee of mee can scante byde to heeare tell. “Hee cannot suffre mee neare his presence, Hee liste not to sende to weeite howe I doo fare, Hee sequestrethe mee from all preamynence, Hee nowhit for mee dothe oughtes cure or care; Hee dothe to mee that hathe beene seene but rare, To caste mee off, his true despoused wife, And seemeth as soarye to heeare of my life. “I deeme euyl counsell dothe leade hym in this; God sende hym better! I can nomore saye; So noble á man great pytee it is That so seduced shoulde wandre á straye; His deade to forthinke onse come shall the daye, When nother I oughtes maye ease his entent, Nor hee to haue tyme to woorke amendement. “What shoulde I oughtes grudge or troble my mynde For that whiche I see theare is no remeadye? To shue to the worlde it weare but waiste wynde; To God I appeale, That sittethe moste hye; Hee is the Judge that judgethe rightuouslye, The wronged to meede of mercye tascende, And the offendre throughe grace to amende. “Hee is Hee onlye in Whome I full truste, This worlde I defye withe his fautours all, Not for that (of forse) I neadys nowe so muste, Bycause I am as thrusten to the wall And bootethe not for remeadye to call, But am beste pleased, sithe God will the same, To bee thus sorted in sorte as I am. “Small deale mee mouethe my Deposition, Whiche nothynge hyndrethe to my saluation; But wheare the fawte is I wische contrition, For ferdre fallynge in flagellation Engendred by Goddys great indignation, Thorowe makynge light of His holye lawes, Setteled in synne, defendinge theyr cawes; “In whiche I wische amendement right gladlye, And not reuengeaunce that God shoulde oughtes take, But, thorowe His grace, demurely and sadlye For fleschelye folye his conscyence to quake, Throughe mouinge thearof his synne to forsake; This is of all my cheeif petytion, To voyde the wayes to fowle perdition. “For thoughe false Frayletee foolischelye voltethe Into the seate of vyle Carnalytee, And so agaynste mee the dooare hee boltethe Witheoute all right and dwe vrbanytee, I, not setteled in suche kynde of prauytee, Beseache to all my malefactours In heauyn withe mee to bee contractours, “Theare in vnytee, withe one harte and mynde, Æternally to geeue laudation To the Redeamer of all mankynde For oure heauynlye coadunation, Notwithestandinge this worldys variation, Oure reconcylement wrought by dyuyne grace, That wee maye (by Christe) inhabyte that place.” Suche of this godlye and blessed woman Was vsuallye the meditation; She dreste not her selfe to cursse, other banne, But tooke in goode worthe her constellation, Lamentynge (rather) the dissipation Of thynges insurginge to Englandys vndoinge, Then in her cause the wrongefull mysusinge. Caput 13. Grysilde remoued from Bugden to Cowemolton, wheare, visited withe sicknes, she felte her tyme come to departe this life; Of her moste Christian preparinge for the same; Of her moste charytable takynge her leaue at Walter and all other Nobles, Knyghtes, Gentlemen and Commoners, desyrynge them all to praye for her. After a season, to Walter pleasinge, She had soiourned at Bugden foresaide, She was remoued, to more diseasinge, To á towne Cowemoulton, theare to be staide; As Walter wolde, she helde her well ápayde, Remembringe howe by murmuration Was greatlye stoored Goddys indignation. Awhile as she had contynued theare, God visited her withe certaigne sicknes, Wheare thorowe greatly abated her cheare, And more and more genderinge in processe That tyme was come to fyne heere her progresse, Whiche, well vndrestandinge her mortall sore, Moste Christianly she preparde thearfore. For bodelye Physike she nowhit cured, But rather wisched to bee dissolued, Of heauynlye ioyes to bee assured, Whiche, after this sorte, she ofte reuolued, That, thoughe in the earthe her corps weare dolued, Her spyrite myght to the heauyns attayne, As in her creation God dyd ordayne. To walke that waye as true Christyan ought, Sauflye and surelye witheoute impedyment, (Thorowe hoape in Hym that dearlye her bought,) Shee firste became á perfecte penytent, Callinge to mynde her life muche negligent, In whatsoeauer her conscyence cowlde mooue Tochynge offense ágaynste God abooue. Then to the worlde she dyd her conuerte, Her practycinges heere callynge vnto mynde, Forthinkinge muche, withe á sorowful harte, That more then she ought she thearto inclynde, Accusinge her selfe for creature vnkynde Vnto her Lorde, that no darkenes may dymme, That eauer this worlde she preferde before Hym. Of Hym (moste meekelye) she mercy besought, Withe tearys oute tryllynge of pure contrition, Grauynge His Passion deepe in her thought For her cheif garde againste perdition, Beseachinge thearby to haue remission Of her offenses venyall and deadlye, Onlye and cheiflye for His great mercye; Remembringe this Texte, in her aduisement, Howe, crauynge of God remyssion of synne, Behoauethe all men, withe constant consent, Vnto their neighbours the like to begyn, Thearby the rather Goddys mercye to wynne, Whiche nowe she hathe in consyderation The more to make, for her sowlys saluation. Thearfore she made this protestation, “O Jesu, my Lorde and soueraigne Kynge, Forgeue Thoue my synnes abomynation, As I forgeue all men me oughtes transgressinge By woorde, woorkynge, or wrongefull suppressinge, And, as I wolde Thy heauynly assuraunce, So graunte it them (Lorde) in contynuaunce.” Then this goode Grysilde to make althinges sure Her Gohostely Father to her dyd let call, To whome her whoale life shee playne did discure; To walke the waye that was vnyuersall, The gatis heere of Deathe that all men passe shall, Depured also withe the Bodye of Christe, Moste commonly called the Euchariste; Withe suche deuotion receauynge the same As neauer myght woman possyble more: No signe of vertue myght any one name But in her was seene, withe other great store; Life in her yeat restinge, tell I shall thearfore, Howe of this worlde she tooke nowe her farewell, As Christian affection did her compell. At Walter (her lorde) she thus wise began, “Farewell, deere Husbonde, to whome I was heere knytt In lawefull spousayle, as God ordayne can, By His holye Churche, I playne confesse itt, ‘And so I take thee tyll Deathe prohybit;’ Farewell, withe full affectyon of harte, For tyme is nowe come I neadys muste departe. “Nowe muste I walke the waye that thow muste go, Nowe maiste thow marrye, impedyment is none; Nowe, that thy true wife is parted thee fro, Thow mayste bee free from fornycation; God wyll of thy synne the mytigation, God wyll that I nowe, to ceasse thy trespace, Shall vnto thy choyce resigne vpp my place. “God sende the mercye and goode succession, Withe prosperous reigne and peace contynuall; God in thy doynges bee thy direction, As to thy sowle healthe moste cheifly make shall; This is my wische before my funerall, Lynkte vnto thee by true Christian looue Whiche neauer (but Deathe) shall any remooue. “My sowle vnto God I only bequeaue, My bodye wheare thowe shalte please to assigne; Aboue grownde I truste thowe wilte it not leaue, To be deuowred withe vermyne or swyne, For that it was onse vnyte vnto thyne, Somuche the rather in Earthe it tengraue, Thoughe other fauour I boote not to craue. “But that I maye haue (as Reason so wolde, For that I am of Christian beleeue) Honest intierment as Christian sholde, Withe charytie delte, the pooare to releeue, To praye for my sowle that may them so meeue, This I beseache thee, as pooare woman maye, Voyde of all frendeshippe (saue God) at this daye. “Beseachinge thee ferdre, of nature and kynde, Thy Doughter Mary to caste not awaye, But that in thy sight she may suche grace fynde To be as thy Doughter knowne an other daye, Sithe of thy bloode she is cummen nonaye; Not for my sake I moue to thee heere yn, But for shee is moste nearest of thy kyn. “Sithe God hath sent her to lyue in this life And is of towardysnes not to bee abhorde, Thoughe mee thoue liste not to take as thy wife, Yeat bee thoue to her thus speciall goode lorde, To some staye of lyuyng to see her restorde, For that (as I saide) she is of thee spronge, And not for my sake to take the more wronge. “Sore I mysdoubte her entretaynynge; If thoue renounce her for Doughter of thyne, No small shalbee her cause of complaynynge; So teachethe the story of Magubryne; Let somewhat thy harte towardys her inclyne, For the deeare Bloode that from Christes syde came owte, For shee is thy bloode, thoue neadist not to dowbte. “And nowe to thee I haue nomore to saye, But Jesus take thee in His protection; To Deathes árest I neadys muste obeye, Whoe hathe in me powred his infection, My sowle to walke to Goddys election; Farewell thearfore for eauer and eauer, For nowe is the tyme I muste dysseauer.” Of whiche her saide mynde and fynall farewell (As sundry dothe saye) a Bill she let make, It sendinge to Walter, that playnly dyd tell The some thearof, howe eauer hee dyd it take, Whoe ofte thearon thought, thoughe lyttle hee spake, As afterwardys occasion had hee, By tryinge this worldys false duplycitee. And, certaynly, for certayne tyme after He was muche sad, ouer he was wonte to bee; Some certayne remorse moued in Walter, By woordys in her Byll that wryten had shee, So was it construed of sundry degree; Of whiche I wyll heere no lengre tale make, But, takynge her leaue, howe ferdre she spake:— “Farewell, my Freendys, that wolde me oughtes well, Jesus rewarde youe wheare I am not hable! Farewell, my Foes, wheare eauer yee doo dwell, God vnto youe all bee mercyable! Farewell, my Seruauntes, so seruyable, That longe hathe serued vnrecompensed, God from all euyll see youe saufe defensed! “Farewell, bothe Lordys and Ladyes of estate!

Of Grysildis godly departynge this life; Her trobles heere ended, euerlastinge rest ensued. Wheare awe of God is not, what myseryes ensuethe. An Elucidation vpon this texte, In Domo Patris mei Mansiones multæ sunt, approuynge, whoe seruethe highelye (as did this Grysilde) is of God highely rewarded. Off this noble woman the day beinge come Her corps to rendre to wheare it firste spronge, As was so ordayned by Goddis dyuyne dome, Leste in departinge the same myght haue wronge, After shee had in sicknes traueylde longe, Shee humblye besought, withe hartys compunction, To haue (as was dwe) the Extreme Vnction. Whearwithe munyted, in true Christian sorte, Agaynste transgression of the senses fyue, So sealynge then vpp eache highe waye or porte, The lyttle life lefte began as to stryue, As thoughe againste Deathe it fayne wolde reuyue, But thearby brought in superation, She of her spirite gaue expiration. So weare her trobles heere brought to an ende, After of sundrye thexpectation, Vnto that purpose whiche longe did attende, Thoughe, cheiflye of all, to her consolation, For reste was to her after trybulation; None otherwise I can in harte esteeme But, sufferinge for right, to weare the dyadeeme. And thoughe shee heere (in this life transitorye) Weare of her honour and kyngedome shut owte, Into a kyngedome of farre more glorye Shee was receaued, I haue no mysdoubte; So, for her, her heauynly Kynge brought abowte, Whiche neauer faylethe all those Hym seruynge, That well ys to serue so noble á Kynge; Whome all her lifetyme she truly obeyde, And serued withe all her harte cowlde deuise, As (partelye) heerein wee haue of her saide, That so to credyte ynoughe may suffice; What more then needethe to tell á tale twice? Shee nowe departed (as earste wee haue tolde), So ended heere her trobles manyfolde. So was the alterynge, by many á daye, Nowe at á poyncte, tochynge the former case; Thoughe Newe vpon Newe theare followed nonaye, As neauer the like in so little space, And no lyttle space contynued the race, For twentye yearys full, it day by day wrought Till it had (almoste) brought all vnto nought. Wheare dwe awe of God is seene neglected, Wheare wycked also dothe predomynat, Wheare throughe false Cupyde the Royalme is infected, Wheare meanys may none his foly mytigate, Wheare the Holye men dothe contamynat, Wheare libertee frayle is not refrayned, Theare is the Countrey muche to bee wayled; Theare needys muste reigne Goddys indignation; Wheare that so dothe, this sequele muste ensue, Of His meere Grace clean depryuation; Depryued thearof, adieu all vertue, In obduracye for to contynue, So followeinge oure owne fragilytee, As thoughe for synne no punyschment sholde bee. Suche daungerous tyme was certaynlye seene By alterations, as is áforesayde, In the later dayes of this noble Queene, Whearby vertue was vtterlye decayde, Excepte in á fewe whiche God (by grace) stayde, As this goode Grysilde specially one, Owte of this life to His mercy nowe gone. Somuche wee haue not of that goode woman Mentioned heere to her commendation, But lyuynge are manye that farre better can Put her dooynges in commemoration, To Goddys moste worthie and highe veneration, For that His Grace was her speciall guyde In vertuous patience to cause her abyde; To Whome, in arte of recompensation, Besydis her seruyce in this life mundayne, As freendys by muche freendely salutation Salutethe their freendys with giftes heere terrayne At Newe yearys tyde, in frendeshippe to remayne, Shee to her Freende that beste for her cowlde shifte, Yealded her sowle for her Newe yearys gifte. For on New? yearys eue (as I was instructed) Shee yealded her gohoste to her Redeamer, And vnto His palace it was conducted, By signes nolesse, dyinge whoe had seene her, Withe vertue florischeinge, no lawrer greener, To thacceptation of her heauynly Lorde; To that He bought her shee was thearfore restorde, And set in place (as well wee maye suppose) Of heauynly blysse, moste gloriously shynynge, For Christe in His Fathers howse dothe disclose To bee Mansyons manye, of His deuysinge, Accordinge to heere the partyes merytinge; Then maye be saide, the gloryous in life Of gloryous place to haue prerogatife. As the moste excellent Virgyn Marye Dyd heere excell in vertue soueraigne, Exaltata est super choros Angelorum, canit Ecclesia. So in the celestiall sanctuarye Her seate transcendethe all creatures certaigne; Of her so to holde it is not in vayne, For the Lorde theare (her Sunne and Issue) As mother nexte Hym ought her to indue. Of John the Baptiste maye also be thought, Inter natos mulierum non surrexit major Joanne Baptista. For that Christe (Hym selfe) hym praised so highlye, Thearto accordynge in place to bee brought; None higher then hee of humayne progenye, Excepte (beforesaide) oure blessed Ladye; In all comparasons of vertue and grace Shee of all creatures muste haue the cheif place. John the Euangeliste, a pure Virgyn, Supra pectus Domini in Cena recubuit. That Christe permytted to sleepe on His breste, Whiche, neauer corrupted withe fleschely synne, Muste neadys in heauyn haue highe entereste; That life (of all lyues) is theare alowed beste, For they whoe theare can bee approued so Followe the Lambe wheare eauer Hee dothe goe. Holy Saincte Pawle that, passinge other all, Ego plus omnibus laboravi. Labored in preachynge of Chrystes gospell, Hathe he not (trowe yee) a farre higher stall Then other that not somuche dyd trauell? As lobour (sic) mountethe, rewarde dothe excell; Whoe sowethe muche, abundantly shall mowe, And hee but lyttle that lyttle dothe sowe. The holy martyrs Laurence and Vincent, Stephyn and Dyonyse, withe other suche mo, Endurynge for Christe most greuous torment, Eauyn tyll the Tortours themselfes liste bydde, Whoe! Shall other (in joye) so passyngelye go That quyetlye endethe, thoughe Christyanlye? No; theare is certayne indyfferencye. The Theeif that henge on Chrystys right syde, Whiche moste his lyfe tyme myserablye ledde, Whome Christe (His mercye to haue that tyme tryde) Tooke to His joyes after hee was dedde, And was of the same suffyciently spedde, Yeat to bee weyed (as I dooe take ytt) His meryte withe Pawle, noman may make ytt. But, vndrestande yee, in this to conclude, The mynde of some somewhat to satysfye: Aboue the celestiall Beatytude Theare is no maner of controuersye, But peace abydynge perpetuallye, Withe suche charytable establischment That but perfecte vnytee dothe theare frequent. Theare the Highest withe Meanest compared, Eyther of other hathe this opynyon, So equalye theare to bee rewarded That but to them is one Fruytion, And so it is in this condition, For the Visyon of the Deytee Is theare theyr full and whoale felycitee. That hathe the Highest, that hathe the Meanest, That is euyn all, and all is yn that; But whoe in this life hathe lyued cleanest, In portion passinge dothe so contemplat; Then is this Grysilde in place situat, Not withe the slackest, that after noone came, But withe the earliest; her life shewethe the same. For euyn from the tyme she had discretion Vnto the season her life dyd expyre, She (trulye) serued withe full affection; Thearto accordynge, she hathe for her hyre; Not as the Murmurer she dyd requyre, But, hoapynge rewarde of endelesse solace, Shee her commended vnto her Lordys grace. As of this woman oure verduyte is suche, So of all other that lyued as dyd shee; Whis [whois] traueyle is great, his rewarde ys muche, Such is the goodnes of Goddys maiestee; On which preasumynge, thereby judge wee This godly Grysilde nowe, after her peyne, With Hym in reste eauerlastynge to reigne. Cap. 16. So soone as Walter had vndrestandynge by certayne report howe Grysildys life was hense seperat, he commaunded at Peter Burrowe to haue her buried, muche honorablye; Of the maner thearof. Shee lyuynge as she dyd (holely) cowlde not but haue goode endinge, thoughe not so of the praue sorte; Her Corone heere taken from her, an euerlastinge was restored. As Walter had perfecte vndrestandynge Grisilde from this life to bee seperat, It moued his harte by inwarde wandringe To haue her worthelye intumulat, Accordynge to her honorable estate, Commaundynge his Offycers (by reporte) That it weare doone in conuenyent sorte. Ferdre, his wyll was her buryall to bee In the See Churche of Peterborowe; After whois pleasure thither brought was shee, The Ordre as howe I lyste not tell thorowe, But, passinge ouer many á forowe, Feelde and leasues, withe medowys fresche and greene, In ordynary sorte, as hathe beene seene. Theare weare in ordre the Offycers sett, As in thobsequye of Pryncelye estate, Bothe Trumpetours and Herawtes, theare they mett, To dooe accordynge as syttethe the rate, Withe Ladyes lamentynge her mortall fate, Whiche, thoughe it bee moste naturall and sure, Suche (yeat of freendys) is the custome and vre. Brought to the place, muche honorablye, The deadde cadauer of this noble Queene, Suche hearsse of waxe, wrought curyouslye, Was theare vpp sett as seelde hathe earste bee seene; The same deadde bodye amyddys theare betweene, Withe sundrye ryche clothes vpon the hearsse layde For purpose whiche heere not neadethe to bee sayde. Executor cheeife of this obsequye Was the Bushoppe mentioned before, Assisted by twoe, withe all dyligencye, Of the same ordre, witheoute anye more, Saue Abbottes and other Religious great store, Synginge and sayinge, as thearto was dwe, Dirige and Masse, while tyme dyd contynue. In tyme of whiche, the Herawtes theare present, At eauery Psalme and Lesson ended, From the saide hearsse they tooke as they went Some certaigne thynge, for cause pretended, Signyfyinge, the honor God lended Vnto that ladye, in suche riche araye, Was (fynallye) heere from her take awaye. At Offerynge tyme the trumpettes dyd blowe Eauerye Estate to take his degree, By sownde of whiche they perfectlye did knowe Who firste, whoe seconde, and who laste to bee; Whiche sight, thoughe pyteful it was to see, Yeat the ordre was muche honorable, Farre passynge texpresse then I am hable. The Masse completed to the Buryall, Withe lightes and torches wondreful manye, And numbre of people bothe great and small, Preparynge was the bodye to carye Vnto the place wheare it shoulde tarye; Proceadinge furthe in honorable wise, Hundreadys theare followynge withe watrye iyes. And in that saide churche, all on the northe syde, At thende of this right solempne funerall, Her corps (in cophyn) they did it theare hyde, Lowe in the earthe, to reste perpetuall, Wheare, in tokne of this exchaunge mortall, The Offycers all, withe muche heauye chere, Their roddys breakynge caste in her sepulchere. So was this noble and godlye woman, (After the course of this mortalytee) Layde in the colde earthe of whiche shee began, Notwithestandynge her highe nobylytee; For whome was dealte vnto the Pouertee Neare to the summe of one hundred pownde, The daye of renderynge her corps to the grounde. Of whiche her deathe and lyfes disjunction All goode folke joyed, in Goddys so ordynaunce; For dyinge heere in true compunction Is signe moste sure of heauyns inherytaunce, As dyd this woman by goode assuraunce, Whoe all her lyfe dayes was to God pleasinge, Whearfore shee cowlde not but haue goode endinge. But, contrary wise, whoe lyuethe at ryat Fleschely and beastely, as leadethe blynde luste, Reauynge and ragynge, all owte of quyat, As, what the flesche wyll, neadys haue yt hee muste, Of suche the sauegarde I haue in mystruste; For Synne accustomynge, Experyence dothe tell, In fyne of the same wyll haue á great smell. Thoughe “inter Pontem et Fontem” (ys sayde) One certaigne theare was that fownde meede of grace, In hoape of the like, in mynde bee yt wayde, Let no man synne, Goddys mercye to purchace, But vertue tenure while heere is lent space; Of suche, whois life is merytoryous, In sight of God the deathe is preacyous. Of synners not so, setteled in malice, But is moste odyous in Goddys dyuyne sight, Withe contrarye rewarde myxte is their chalice, Fyre and sulphur to the synner of right; The godly joyned to heauynlye delyte; Whiche dyuersiteis, wiselye adnoted, Geauethe occasion synne to bee lothed. As dyd this noble and godlye Grysilde, All her whoale life tyme heere synne forsakynge; What was to Goddys pleasure she gladly fulfilde, The pooare and neadye greatlye comfortynge; Whearfore Hee wolde her to haue resortynge Vnto His heauynlye habytation, To haue perdurable Coronation. Thoughe heere her Córóne was her depryued, The other shoulde neauer haue defection; So had the Highest for her contryued In His æterne præscient Election, To Whome althyngis are in subjection, Bothe heauynly, earthely, and lowe in the Hell, Wythe hartys of all Kyngis to wyll and compell; And dyd (nodowbte) for her, His true seruaunte, At ende of this relynquyscheinge her life, Woorke in Walter that hee shoulde neadys graunte To haue her buryed like to Pryncys wife; Suche was (thorowe Hym) her prerogatife, Receauynge her sowle to His heauynlye blysse, Whois grace dyrecte vs the waye not to mysse. Caput 17. The maner (muche parte) of the dolefull complaynte and lamentation of the moste gratious and vertuous Pryncesse Marye for the departure of her noble mother goode Grysilidis, she beynge (thoughe absent) the Mooarner cheeif inthobsequye of her Funerall; and of her fylyall commendynge her vnto theauerlastinge mercy of almyghtie God. In funerye of this áforesaide woman Is to bee had in consyderation Who was cheeif Mooarner to be compted than, Of all the thronge and congregation; For, to expresse in breeue narration, It was her deere Doughter Marye (by name) Thoughe absent she weare, and kepte from the same; She was cheeif Mooarner, it well maye bee saide, All other to her weare but as countrefettes; She, heearynge her Mother vndre booarde laide, In to her closett demurelye shee gettes, Her cheeakes all withe tearys she ruthefully wettes, Kneealynge á downe in contemplation, Lamentynge her Mother vndre this fashion:— “O heauynly Father and Kynge celestiall, Lorde of all Lordys, Thy tytle ys so, To Whome specyall obeysaunce dothe fall, Thy ordynaunce dyuyne no man may parte fro, All one to conuynce, in feawe as in mo, My Mother hense rapte from this worldys vision To wheare Thowe pleasiste to haue her to go, Thowe graunte her, (Lorde), Thy heauynly fruition! “Her to commaunde to demore or departe Thy office it is, none may Thee resiste, Her Thowe heere madiste by Thy dyuyne arte, And woldiste to tarrye so longe as Thowe liste, Tyll nowe her life threade Thowe liste to vntwiste (As in all flesche for mannys punytion) Whoe (naturally) of mee is sore myste, Yeat graunte her, (Lorde), Thy heauynly fruition! “From tyme she was firste in wombe conceaued Vnto the daye of her dysseauerynge, Of her the tradynge Thowe neauer leaued, But waste her Guyde, her lyfe aye orderynge, And as Thowe woldiste she was conformynge; Thy grace (from evyll) was her munytion; As Thowe haste so to her beene tenderynge, So graunte her, (Lorde), Thy heauynly fruition! “After, (in processe), as Thowe liste vouchesaue, Thowe hyther conueidste her, at Thy pleasure, Wheare to the same shee dyd her behaue, Thoughe sorowes sought her farre oute of measure, Throughe whiche, withe Thee, she heaped vpp treasure, For that she loued no sedytion But serued Thee trulye, as shee had leasure; Whearfore, Thowe graunte her Thy heauynly fruition! “And nowe Thowe pleasiste her trobles to fyne Heere in this state of myserye and care, And shee to repayre wheare Thowe liste assigne, Wheare Thy seruauntes and true beleauers are, As thorowe Thy mercye I well credyte dare, Bycause shee ended withe true contrytion; For Thowe to all suche digne Judgement doiste spare, And grauntiste freelye Thy heauynlye fruition. “So is my hoape in Thye benygne mercye That her Thowe haste take to Thy heauynly reste, Thee eauermore to praise and magnyfie, As Thowe canste ordayne thynges all for the beste; And, blessed Lorde, graunte this humble requeste, That I maye bee of like condytion, After her life my life to see dreste, Withe her to haue Thy heauynly fruition! “Of whome (my Mother and Educatrice) Callynge to mynde her conuersation, I cannot but in moste dolorous wise Fall into thoughtfull lamentation, To mysse her motherly consolation; But, sithe it cummethe of Goddys prouysion, I can but wische her sowlys saluation, To haue withe Hym of His fruytion. “Thowe parted this life, O meeke Mother myne! The louyngiste that eauer to chylde myght bee, What shall I dooe but this worldys joyes resigne, And daylye praye God to fetche mee to thee? In tyme thowe lyuydste I felte aduersytee, And muche more hangethe of dysposition; God I beseache His pleasure dooe withe mee, And thee to graunte His heauynlye fruytion. “While life in mee lastethe I shall not forget To mee (thy childe) thy motherly tendrenes; Of fylyall duetye I am so in debte By what meanys I maye the same to expresse, Thoughe not (as to saye) in signes of heauynes, But hartye prayer and meeke petytion, That God (of His ineffable goodnes) Will graunte to thee His heauynly fruytion. “And, as for thee (daylye) I shall so praye Whyle in this life I haue contynuaunce, So praye thowe for mee, I truste thowe so maye, Tescape of this worlde the false conueyaunce, Withe what els enemyes woorkethe me annoyaunce By false and sathanyke sedytion, The heauynly Kynge to shewe His puysaunce, And thee to graunte His heauynly fruytion. “What is of this life the pompous estate But (as to saye) á burdayne ponderous, Witht [sic] sundrye chargys that dothe onerat Of streyte accompte to Christe moste gloryous, Excepte true bearynge, whiche is meruelous, Only graunted throughe Goddys prouysion; So ys oure nature fownde contraryous, That voydethe vs ofte from His fruition. “But thowe (my Mother), nowe voyded this light, So eauenlye lyuydiste in thy vocation Towardys heere all sortys, the Goode can recyte, That soone was made thy computation, So seruethe my imagynation; So godly was thy dysposition, All vyce thowe puttidste in sequestration, Whearfore thowe haste of Goddys fruition. “So is my hoape in God my Creator, So ys to Hym my quotydyan requeste, So ys the woonte of Hym (the Grace Dator) All suche to receaue in His heauynlye reste, Speciallye those for right heere suppreste, Meekelye sufferynge this worldys punytion; Of whiche wronged sorte thowe maiste bee confeste, And numbred to haue of His fruytion. “To whome thy sowle, of His Creation, Withe all submyssion I meekelye commende, Beseachynge His myghtye Domynation From this worldys malice mee saufe to defende, Whiche suethe the wayes that lowe dothe descende Vnto the lake of fowle Perdytion, But thee and mee, that otherwise entende, To haue (for eauer) of His fruytion.” Suche was this Maydyns meditation For her deeare Mother, to her moste louynge, Withe harte sore plunged in perturbation Throughe sundrye stormys her strongely prouynge, Yeat shee all constante, standynge vnmouynge, Specially hoapynge in Goddys tuytion, As moste neadfull to her was behouynge, To wynne the fruyte of His fruytion. The Mother departed this mundayne life, The Doughter remaynynge, compaste with care, The wicked withe her at contynuall strife, The enuyous serpent to tempte her so dare, The seruauntys of hym the like dyd not spare; As abjecte, shee lyued in muche derision; So leaue I her, all voyde of hartys welfare, But only in hoape of Goddys fruytion. Cap. 18. A conferrynge betweene the firste Walter and the Seconde, The firste Grysilde and the Seconde, approuynge the Seconde Grysilde of farre more worthy estymation then the Firste, also her Maryage to be moste lawful; Of whis Issue heauyn and earthe reioyced. So clokedlye vndre darke couerture We haue not walked in this Historye, But that the readers may vndrestande sure The meane of oure mentioned memorye, Not fygured as by Alligorye, But this sayde Grysilde, playnlye to defyne, Is playnlye ment the goode Queene Catharyne. Walter (her husbonde) kynge Henry the Eight, A man muche noble in pryncely corage, Yeat in this mateir, importynge great weight, He was wronge leadde and wandred at outrage, (As may well bee thought, throughe louys dotage, Loue leacherous, inconstante and fycle, Whiche in the frayle dothe stooare and muche prycle.) Whye wee compare Catharyne to Grysilde, Henry to Walter, as shewthe evydence, For that in thys Newe is mateir dystilde As in the Olde, consyderinge pretence, Withe farre passinge vehementer offense Of Henryes party to Catharyne was dooe, Then eauer Walter shewde Grysilde vntooe. Fyrste, Walter, á man of highe nobylitee, To Grysilde (farre base) auouched to knytt, Whoe shewed her tatchesse of instabylitee When from her feloweshippe he neadys wolde flytt, Her childred hee made as buryed in pytte; Relynquischinge her, hee tooke her ágayne, And in this all whoale hee dyd hym but fayne. This alter Walter, not joyned in base, But in all honour machte with his equall, Relynquischinge her, hee had not the grace Her as to sett in her pristynat stall, But earnestely wrought her harte to appall, Witheoute all maner reconciliation, Tyll Deathe (in her sorte) made seperation. Howemuche as Grysilde the Firste (as wee meane) Was issued of meane and lowe progeniture, Somuche the easyer shee myght faschyon cleane The sturdye dooynges of Walter tendure; Lowe, lowe to bee brought, not pestrethe Nature, Lowe easyer maye aduersitee susteyne Then Highe in myserye lowe to compleyne. Walter the Firste his issue not hated, But fostred the same muche honorablye; Thother Walter his issue abated That was of hym issued moste lawfullye; So was betweene them great dyfferencye; The Firste muche kynde, thoughe he dissymuled, Thother vnkynde, as maye bee lykened. Thus Walter withe Walter hathe lykelynes, For vnto their wyues commyttynge offense; And Grysilde to Grysilde lykewise to gesse, For their meeke sufferynge and patience; But muche more is to haue preamynence The Seconde Grysilde, by goode authorytee, Then the Fyrste, as reason seemethe to mee. For of her great Patience theare is nodowbte, Her factes in present remembraunce dothe reigne; The Firste howe her dooynges weare brought abowte, To vs in theis dayes they are vncertayne; Many imagyne that Petrarke dyd but fayne; Howe muche the Seconde is true, that yee haue herde, Somuche before thother shee is too bee preferde. And sithe that Ethnykes accustomed (of olde) The famous actys of their noble women In sorte of Historyes to haue enrolde, As Historyographys sawe worthye to penne, Howe muche in thois oure later dayes, then, Of suche noble woman as oure Grysilde was To haue her historye brought vnto passe. In whiche I haue sayde as my knowledge leadethe, And as of oother I haue beene instructed; If anye heere after that this same readethe, By ferdre knowledge beeynge conducted, Shall seeme the dwe I haue ouerflucted, Let hym take yt in reformation, That more maye serue to acceptation. I weare muche lothe of highe other lowe To bee fownde fawtye yn my comprysinge, But farre loather opynyon wronge to growe, When I am gone, by this my saide wrytinge; Rather I had mysse forme of endytinge (As to saye, meeaters true obseruation) Then to leaue this in varyation. Theare are that muche more can saye in this Bycawse muche more they sawe in practice, Whiche withe this ladye Grysylidis Weare conuersante and dyd her seruyce, But to my purpose this dothe suffice, Withe somewhat ferdre comprobation That wrongefull was her seperation. The tradynge totall of this comprysement Perswadethe of wrongis to Grysilidis, Approued by sequele moste euydent; As, to the purpose receaued nowe this, To her was argued, she was sterilis, Also wife to Walters brother dedde, Whearfore she was to bee repudied. To whiche objection concurryngely take, That shee reiected and newe receaued, The beste that myght vnto the purpose make, Whearby issue myght bee conceaued, From one to fyue to bee alleaued; And yeat (in fyne) whoe liste to vndrestande To Grysildys seade the State was brought to hande. If wronge had bee their copulation, God wolde of wronge (Whiche is endlesse Right) Not so haue set in estymation That wrongefull weare in His heauynly sight; But, beeinge rightfull, by His dyuyne myght, Hathe Grysildys seade in honor exalted, Thoughe earste (as base) yt farre á lowe halted. At whois pryncelye Inthronization (Muche meruously by God brought abowte) The Heauynlye Spyrytes made Jubilation As my conscyence perswadethe owte of dowbte, For that His enemyes withe her beare no rowte, False Heresyarkes, poysonlye harted, That earste Goddys glorye had neare peruerted. For, moste certaynly, wheare wicked Sathan Withe his tortuous wayes is eiected, Purged and clensed as God ordayne can, And His dwe honor trulye erected, Theare (credyblye) the Spirytes elected (As in the conuersion of synners to grace) Takethe occasion of heauynlye solace. And, as the celestyall Hierarchies so Of oure conuersion reioyced suche wise, So thowsande thowsande withe hundredfolde mo Withe joyinges in God their hartys did suffice, To see that was downe agayne to arise, The Christian Faythe withe Heresye opprest, As they had cawse moste certaynly earnest. Emonges all whiche, moste speciallye of all, Wee Englische Men ought to rendre God thankes, That vs Hee pleased to grace agayne call, Whiche weare as men caste ouer the seaye bankes Into the Carybdis of feendelye phalankes, Withe them to gnasche in desperation For oure from God false seperation. For Faythe was heere (in maner) neare extyncte Withe muche hydeous innouation, The Badde agaynste the Goode dyuyllischly lynkte By tomuche hatefull indignation; The pledge heere left to oure saluation Of Chrystys bodye that bought vs from blame, None heere so hardye in right sorte to name. Whearfore to God bee speciall dwe prayse, For that (of His mercye superabundaunte) Hee pleased for vs to woorke in suche wayse, Thoughe wee to His lawes weare farre repugnaunte, Whoe graunte vs nomore to bee inconstaunte, For please Hym wee cannot, the Scripture saithe, Wee seaueringe from the Catholique faithe. Caput 19. Grysilde, departed to God, prayethe for vs, wee neeade not to dowbte, thoughe some (of wronge opynyon) boldethe the prayer of Sayntes to profite nowhyt; á brobation [sic] to the contrary, and that Englande by the prayer of the blessed aboue was (of late) reduced to the Christian Faithe ágayne (as wee maye well suppose) that weare gone astraye. Grysilde, reignynge withe God, dothe praye for vs is not to bee doubted. Owre Christian Grisilde, as ye haue herde tell, Rendred to the grownde, as right so shall wee, In mercy of God I leaue her to dwell, Partyners withe her Who graunte vs to bee; Shee, joyinge the heauynlye felycitee, For vs (her olde subjectes), I dare well saye, In all oure trobles dothe instantlye praye; Thoughe myserable men, insanyat and grose, Seduced by Sathan, the Prynce of darkenes, For Sayntes in glorye dothe wrongelye depose Theye weeit not owre prayinges to them in distresse, Nor oughtes can helpe to ease oure heauynes By prayinge for vs to oure heauynlye Father; Whois errour to ceasse, theis prooues I gather:— If only to God owre thoughtys inwardelye (By prayer or els) bee perfectelye knowne, And to none other His creatures on hye, Then weare the ordynaunce quyte ouer throwne Whiche in Christys Churche of consuetude is growne, Howe the Angels and Sowlys in reste aboue Dothe impetrat God for synners behoue. In Earthe, wee haue knowledge, by holye Jeamys, Howe muche dothe profyte the prayre of the Juste; Then, they nowe regnynge aboue the sunne beamys, In farre higher fauour withe God wee graunte muste, For owte of fauour none can them theare thruste, The more in fauoure, the more profyte they maye, As, to optayne what eauer they for praye. And of the Lorde moste renowmed (sic) and great, (The highe, myghtye, and Creator of all), This is alwayes the accustomed feate, His seruauntys heere that to Hym ascende shall In Heauyn to indwe withe grace more specyall; Then, if theyr prayer maye profite in this life, In Heauyn they hathe farre more prerogatife. If Angels (whiche are but creatures certayne) Dothe knowe the synners conuersyon to grace, Whiche conuersion is yn the harte playne, For speciall prooif, and not by the face, Then, Saynctes maye the like, in semblable case, Sithe God his Freendys liste them so nomynat, And shall in judgement withe Hym associat. The Angels, the Scripture dothe playnly declare, Reioycethe farre more in one synners amendement Then in great numbers that innoxious are Whiche neaded not to bee come penytent, And, like so the Sayntes, by forme consequent For that, as Angels, they creatures bee, And dothe (withe them) pytee oure infirmytee. If Dyuyllis oure euyl deadys and thoughtes contraryous Shall laye to oure chargis, not purged by peanaunce, Then knowe they oure fawtes, by proofe notoryous; Whye els dothe Scripture put yn remembraunce Howe Sathan, that workethe vs all his vengeaunce, In Judas harte entred, and wrought theare the waye His Maister (Christe Jesus) to sell and betraye? Of Thobye wee reade howe that Raphael (Goddys Medycyne, by interpretation) His prayers, made in his hartys secreat cell, To God of them hee made presentation; And, as of Thoby in suche sayde faschyon, So oure goode Angels eache godlye entent Of vs fulfilled to God dothe present. Not that but suche wayes He dothe them els weete, (To Whois dyuyne iyes althynges are áperte), But thorowe Charytee, that is so sweete, God wyll hys Spyrytes to woorke in couerte, And also his Saynctes, of one lynked harte, In like heauynlye loue that so dothe excell, To wyll and wysche vs moste earnestlye well. All whiche (their knowledge) in God they see ytt, As wee in the glasse whoe standethe behynde vs, Thoughe the comparason bee farre vnfytt; So wyll Hee haue it, of His wyll gratious, That as wee Worldelye in knoweledge curyous Transcende the Brutall, by muche dyfference, So vs the Heauynlye, by passinge excellence. Wee see heere in earthe, sayncte Pawle dothe expresse, As in a glasse, or shadowed mysterye; But theare, oure knowledge shall have ful perfectnes, Witheowte obumbraunce or other fallacye. Thearfore I argue, as in this partye, Owre imperfection in this state mundayne To what Saynctes maye dooe it cannot attayne. Then, sithe holye Churche, heere mylytante nowe, Receauethe and teachethe their prayers to preuayle, What shoulde wee otherwise then so allowe If wee withe Peter in his shippe will sayle? Whoe holdethe by her, hys holde cannot fayle: Then holde I, this Grisildis prayer to profite, As Cytizyns of God throughe heauynly meryte. For, owte of the waye as wee weare late streyed, I fyrmelye beleeue throughe prayer made abooue Of Saynctes withe immortalytee arayed, (That so brennethe in charytee and looue, As, to my seemynge, sensyblye dothe prooue) Wee weare reuoked and called vnto grace From rennynge hedelynge oure dampnable race. As after this maner imagyne I maye Their prayers for vs to spreadde in Goddys sight:— “O Thowe cleare shynynge euerlastynge Daye, Thowe God That art of goodnes ynfynyte, In Whome consistethe all whoale oure delyte, Vouchesaufe Thyne Earys to oure prayers inclyne, Prosterned to fore Thy maiestee dyuyne! “On Englande, that sometyme (as was moste dwe) Had Thee in juste feare and digne reuerence, Vntyll Thyne Enemye, that Thee dothe pursue, (Thenuyous Serpent, full of pestylence,) Opprest the same throughe Heresyes pretence, Extende Thy mercye, and dooe not refuse Them to Thy seruyce agayne to reduce. “Remembre (O Lorde!) of this heauynlye Porte Howe manye thowsandys dothe oure mynysterye Vnto Thy majestee, in owre humbleste sorte, That sometyme weare of Englandys progenye, And haue theare bretherne fledde from Thy glorye, For whome wee praye, as charytee dothe bynde, Owte of the Feendys thrall Thowe wylte them vnwynde. “Remembre wee theare, by many á daye, Haue serued Thy grace, as true Christyans ought, And thorowe Thy mercye, we maye well saye, Are hyther vnto endelesse joyes brought: To ceasse their malyce let moue in Thy thought At oure contemplation, O dreade Soueraygne! To praise of Thy name to florische ágayne. “Remembre howe hundreadys remaynynge theare yeete (Thoughe but an handefull to the reasydue) Prosternethe them downe as lowe at Thy feete, In fastynge and prayinge to Thee that dothe shwe, Owte of their myserye them to rescue; Whois prayers attende, withe owres, in this case, And call to Thy fowlde the streyed (by Thy grace). “Remembre, the lengre Thowe stayest Thy hande The ferdre they flee by numbres manyfolde, Inowghe hathe suffered the fewe that dothe stande Of wronges and scoarnynges, as Thowe doiste beholde; Ouer Thy seruauntes the wicked are bolde, And hathe (of malyce) moste vyolentlye Destroyed and troadde downe Thy sanctuarye. “Remembre the Cowntreys approxymat At Englandys example howe they dothe flytt; No ferdre let them so intoxycat By standynge stiffe in their sensuall wytt; Put in their cheeakes Thy constreynynge bytt That will not approache Thy wyll to obey, By meanys and foarsinges, as Thowe wotiste what wey. “Remembre, if lenger Thowe liste to forbeare, Thy Christyan Faithe and godly reuerence Wylbe abolisched vtterlye theare, So ouer them hathe Sathan preamynence; Shewe furthe the powre of Thy magnyficence, Let not Thyne Enemye that Royalme so despoyle, And Thowe Cheeif Lorde of Royaltee and Soyle. “Remembre, Thy name hathe florysched theare longe; Their seruynge Thee theare, nowheare was the lyke; None had to Thy prayse so melodyous songe, In Europe, Asia, other Affryke, Withe sweete ensence, as balme aromatyke, Oratyons also of pure deuotion; Let thearfore of them bee no dyuortion. “Remembre Thy douaryes Thowe haste them indude, As Beawtye, Wytt, and Aptnes soueraigne, Agilitee, Boldenes, and Fortytude, Withe what maye decor Nature humayne; Besydys their Soyle garnysched withe Grayne, And Commodyteis passynge to compare; Suche noble Prouynce from Thee doo not spare. “What if they hathe runne headelynge áwhile For synne, whiche Thowe haste vnponysched lefte, Doo not foreauer Thyne Englande exile, And suffre Thyselfe to bee thearof berefte; Agayne (as Thowe owghtiste) bee Thowe thearin fefte, For Thy great mercy, whiche none can dyscusse, And for the Bloodesheadynge of Thy Sunne Jesus.” Emongys whiche heauynlye Supplicatours, The gloryous Queene of that highe regyon, Withe ornat white virgynall awaytours, In numbre manye, and sundry á legion, In humblest wise that any maye thynke on, For Englandys honoure and Christian estate The Syttynge in Throne shee dyd supplicate; Sayinge, “O myghtye, and myghtyest of all! Thowe, that of man art moste myndefull alwaye, Vouchesaufe olde Englande to grace agayne call And dooe yt not from thy fauour delaye; My Douarye it hathe beene many á daye, By mynystrynge seruyce to the honoure of Thee; Redresse the amysse to former degree. “Geeue not the glorye of Thy holye name, That theare hathe longe beene had in reuerence, To anye other then to the selfe same; Great muste then bee the inconuenyence. Graunte Reformation by thy Prouydence, Thowe that (of mercye) desyrest to wynne The synner to grace, then perische in synne.” Thus maye imagyne eauery true harte The Blessed aboue for Englande to praye; So soone (of yt selfe) it cowlde not conuerte, So farre and so many weare gone á straye; Of whiche (as before) I cannot but saye Oure godlye Grysilde to streeke á great stroake, The mercye of God towardys vs to prouoake. Caput 20. Heere are summed the great Graces planted in Grysilde while she was heere lyuynge; her highe Linage myxte withe Meekenes, her Pytee to the pooare, her Deuotion to God, her Sufferaunce in aduersite, her perfecte Charytee to all men, Fightynge agaynste the Worlde, the Dyuyll and the Flesche, whiche if theye bee Martyrdoms, then maye she be likened for one. Her highe Progeny mixte withe meekenes moste specyallye. Nowe to some vpp the some of this purpose, To glorye of God moste specyallye, For speciall graces, as I shall dysclose, In Grisilde planted moste plentyouslye; As firste, her highe and noble Progenye, Then her Meekenes and vertue soueraigne, Seelden seene met in suche Estate mundayne. Her lowly consyderinge whearof shee firste sprange, as of the earth.Seeleden seene Pryncesse her looke to inclyne Downe to the Earthe, as to bee but earthelye, Whiche agaynste fowle Pryde is cheif medycyne, (Whoe liste, geeue aduertence intentyuelye) As dyd this Grysilde for all her state hye; Eauer she had this specyall respecte To bee but mortall, withe synne all infecte. Seeleden is seene Pryncesse as Grisylde was her pytefull respectynge the Pooare and Indigent. Her Pryncelye iyen on the Pooare to conuerte, Whiche was vnto her as myrrour or glasse Her orygynall to note in that parte, As ofte reuoluynge in her inwarde harte Howe God myght have setten suche in Estate And shee (as they) to haue beene of like rate. Seeleden is seene Pryncesse the Pooare to visyte, her visitynge the Pooare and helpynge the same. And withe her owne handys the same tapparayle, But this goode Grisilde had cheeiflye delyte The Pooare to helpe bothe withe meede and vytayle, Whiche nowe (to her comforte) dothe greatly aduayle; Her meekenes (in that parte) to the Pooare adept Christe, as to Hym selfe, Hee dothe it accept. Seeleden is seene Pryncesse to syt vppon kneeis her humlinge her selfe on kneeis to God in daylye prayour. To God (withe the lowest) her selfe to commende; This humble woorkewoman as one of Christe Beeis Agaynste the hell Hornett did stowtely contende, Hoonye to Hys hyue to gather and to sende, As sweete examples, which shee dyd heere wurche, To the furnyschynge of His holye Churche. Seelde is seene Pryncesse to ryse at myddenyght her rysinge at mydde nyght to serue God in contemplation. On Dauyths harpe to searche the melodye; This blessed bodye had speciall delyte In contemplation of that to occupye; Of God shee purchaste great fauour thearbye, As to withestande temptations manyfolde, And nowe in the Booke of Life is enrolde. her meekelye sufferynge in aduersytee.Seelde is seene Pryncesse meekely to susteyne (In sorte as she ought) this worldys vexation; This godly Grisilde to none did compleyne But althynges tooke in goode acceptation, Rather wischeinge reconciliation, By prayer to her Lorde omnipotent, Then vengeaunce, plage, or other punyschment. her hie majestie humelynge wythe the meanest.Seelde is seene state of magnanymytee (As this goode Grisild was sorted vntooe) Feaffed with grace of pure humylitee (As earste is said) with the meaneste to dooe, Whois holye dooynges maye other (the lyke) wooe, Meekenes, withe charytee, for to embrace, As shee, of God His fauour to purchace. The Holy Gohoste was whoale her ayder, throughe whome her fame shall neauer dye.Theis seeldome seene sightes in cheifly the moste In Grisild weare seene florische floryschelye; So was shee ayded by the Holye Goste, As seelde in oure tyme was the like to espye, For which her highe fame shall neauer sure dye; Thoughe heere Oblyuyon maye yt abrace, So shall yt not owte of the Better place. Then ought this noble and godlye woman To bee exalted in worthie degree, For her life, that so vertuously began, Also contynued, as heere herde haue yee, And lykewise ended, withe all charytee, Wiche to conferre withe other blessed Withe like rewarde she is nowe possessed. If wrongefull entreatinge and trobled harte For stedfastely standynge in rightuousnes Bee a Martyrdome, by cowrse of panges smarte, Thorowe Goddys woorkinge meryte to encresse, Then, as holye Hierom dothe expresse Of Paula that clearly this worlde did forsake, This Grisild maye in the numbre bee take. Fightynge againste theis stowte Capytayns three, The Dyuyll, the Flesche, and this Worldys vayne delyte, Withestandynge their meanys to iniquytee, Whearto the Enemye the mynde dothe exite, A Martyrdome maye bee called suche fight; Of whiche kynde Martyrdome, as I dooe gesse, The lyfe of Grisild for her can expresse. But for it sittethe [sic] not oure facultee Suche honor to anye as to impute Of martyrdome, or suche heauynlye degree, Howe holye soeauer bee heere their brute, Onlye the Highest assignethe that sute; Thearfore to His appoyntement dyuyne What Hee rewardethe to Hym wee resigne. Remembre I doo this texte of Salomon, Sunt Justi atque Sapientes, et opera eorum in conspectu Dei; et tamen nescit homo vtrum amore an odio dignus sit. “Theare are in this life bothe godlye and wise Whois warkes withe God are in acceptation, And yeat farre passethe for Man to decise Whyther they stande in fauour of Goddys iyes Other yn hatred;” for Hee onlye ys That all rewardethe after pleasure Hys. To whome all dowbtefulnes wee dooe commende As to Hym that knowethe the hartys secreacye; In judgeing the beste wee dooe not offende, Sithe all wee referre to His dyuyne mercye And to thaduauncynge of His powre myghtye, For Grysilde, and other, their vertues all From Hym they sprange, as well orygynall. To Whome bee praise and exaltation, Glorye and honour eauerlastyngelye, Whoe graunte vs in this peregrynation To lyue to His pleasure accordyngelye, As Grysildys example dothe testyfie, That, fynyschynge heere a Chrystian ende, To reste perpetuall wee maye ascende. Amen. Heere endethe the Historye of Grysilde the seconde, onlye meanynge Queene Catharyne, Mother to oure moste dread soueraigne ladye Queene Marye, fynysched the 25 daye of June the yeare of owre Lorde 1558 by the symple and vnlearned Syr Wyllyam Forrest, Preeiste, propria manu. To the Queenys Majestie. An Oration consolatorye To Marye oure Queene, moste worthy of fame, That longe hathe traueyled in panges sorye, Nowe to quyet her selfe in Goddys name, Wyllyam Forreste. Emonges muche inwarde profounde perpendinges, Twoe are to bee obeyed aboue all thyngys. So ferre as seruethe wyttys perspycuytee, Twoe I adnote, before all other thynges, To whome behouethe singular soueraigntee, (Thoughe farre the One dyfferent in degree) As of eache wearynge their recognysaunce, Looue, Honour, Dreade, and dwe Obeysaunce. The highe, myghty, moste magnyficent Lorde, God oure Creator moste especyallye. That highest aboue holdethe pryncely reasydence, By Whome this worlde (ruynous) was restorde To tholde forme and pristynat preamynence, The Firste is, that cheeifly Obedyence Withe thother Feualties are appropryat, For that Hee is the Cheeif Pryncely Prymat. Then nexte the highe Powre, oure soueraigne Queene. Thother art thowe, O soueraigne Pryncesse! Marye, Queene of Englandys domynyon, So soarted by His omnypotent goodnes That regnethe Three in perfecte unyon, Yeat farre impar by juste opynyon, Thoughe heere in earthe nexte Hym I none alowe So highe, woorthye, and noble, as art Thowe. Honor, latria, dwe only vnto God: Honor, dulia, to men in their degreis.To yowe (I saye) dothe dygnelye appertayne Moste loyall duetyes for subjectes tensue; To God (the heauynlye myghty souerayne) Honor, latria, to none other els dwe; And to thee (Marye), as Clarkes can construe, Honor, dulia, thearby knowne to bee Atwixte yowe twayne the great dyuersitee. God, Kynge Immortall, abooue; Mary, heere Queene mortal, beneath. Hee aboue, æuerlastyngly regnynge, Thowe heere alowe, passible and mortall; Hee in Hym selfe althynges conteynynge, Thowe at His wyll to sytt or to fall; Hee omnypotent, Thowe but as His thrall, Hee to commaunde, Thowe meekely to obeye; Suche Hee, suche Thowe, thowe cannyste not saye naye. God, the creator; Mary, His creature. Hee the Lorde and Kinge; She His Mynystre. Hee God, That althynges created of nought, And sendethe the fruytes tencrease and to sprynge; Thowe His Creature, vpp traded and bought Ouer His People to haue the gouernynge; Thowe His Mynyster, Hee thy Lorde and Kynge; Thowe for thy Office to Hym comptable, Hee alone Keysor incomparable. Hee Lorde, Thowe Subjecte; sithe knowne so is Hee, God, aboue all, to be honored as God; and Marye aboue all in earthe as Queene. Hee thearfore, as Lorde aboue other all Moste passynge, highely magnyfied to bee As God only, and Kynge Imperyall; And Thowe aboue all creatures mortall As His Electe and specyall enoynted, By Hym ouer vs to reigne appoynted. To whome (that myghty magnyficent Kynge), Howe bounden wee are to God for owre noble Queene Marye. Besydys all gracys Hee Englande can indwe, Moste specyall cawse of thankes renderynge Wee ought to geeue, O noble Queene, for yowe, For oure agayne reuocation nwe, From Heresyes wronge, dampnable and nought, To bee in Christyan estate agayne brought. To bee created in sorte heere humayne, Man to haue all gracys, yeat lackynge Faithe, what can they oughtes profyt hym? Withe dowaryes indued agreeinge to the same, Of lyneamentes and wytt soueraigne, Withe what els maye anye worthely name, Concernynge in Faythe to bee owte of frame (To heauynly passage whiche ordrethe the sayle), What maye theis all to purpose oughtes aduayle? What maye yt profyte to bee as Samson stronge, Nowghtes profiteth all wisedome, longe lief, highe honor, withe what els maye bee, lackinge Christyan Religion. Withe Salomon tafflowe withe wisedome and wytt, Withe Nestor to haue heere contynuaunce longe, Withe Alexander great in honour to sytt, Withe other worthyes whome Deathe made hense flytt, And to incurre eauerlastynge perdytion For faylinge of true Christyan relygion? Howe late this Royalme by Scysmys and Hereasies was greatlye troboled.So was ytt, it ys not yeate owte of remembraunce, Moste odyous Schysmys this Royalme dyd late perturbe, Almoste the moste parte geauynge attendaunce (Aswell of Nobles as the rustycall Scrubbe, Withe thowsandys in Cyteeis and eke in Suburbe) To that all true Christian faythe dyd abhore, Receauynge plagys, not yeat extyncte, thearfore. God, for the Goodes sake, sended reformation in this Royalme.So heere contynuyng, by too longe space, Aboue (as I adnote) twentye yearys full, Tyll God, of His meere and specyall grace, For the Goodys sake respected their trobull, The cawsers (so cawsinge) withe sorowes dobull Owte of their romethes euacuatynge cleane, Bycause they dyd them no better demeane; Erectynge then Thee, a Mayden well knowne, (Thoughe cleane vnknowne concernynge mannys vsage) By grace in thee that of longe tyme was sowne, Thowe to set free his Churche owte of bondage, Whiche thowe not slackydste, withe manly corage Rather then womans, whoe liste to aduerte, For whiche harde corsayes hathe streyned thy harte. But bee assured in thy heauynlye Lorde, For all thy Enemyes malignytee, Howe eauer they spurne, or at thee remorde, Hee wyll (as Hee hathe) from them defende thee, Theyr stormys (I full hoape) ouer shaken bee; Whoe anye moe suche wyll ferdre attempte As had the other, God them not exempte! Well thowe remembrest (O noble woman!) Tanquam aurum in fornace probavit electos Dominus. The Goode God prouethe, as golde by the fyre, And, consequentlye, Hee fyndethe them than Woorthye to haue Hys blysse for their hyre. Dauyd, whois harte Goddys spyrite can inspyre, Declarethe the juste to bee afflicted, Multæ tribulationes justorum. But God wyll them not see derelicted. Vnto whiche purpose I thynke vpon well Of the moste chaiste Innocent Joseph, sunne to the holy patriarke Jacob, or Israel. Of godlye Joseph the great perturbaunce, Sunne vnto Jacob, or Israel, Howe longe contynued his greuous peanaunce Before estate quyet to hym dyd chaunce, Whiche was from that hee was Sixteene yearys olde Tyll nearehande Fortye, in Genesis is tolde. Hee was by Bretherne, cursed and enuyous, Maligned, afflicted, vncharytablye, Abanysched farre from his Fathers howse, And solde (as bonde man) withe muche vylonye Vnto worshippers of ydolatrye, So wryten by Ephrem the godlye Grecyan, in quodam sermone de Joseph. Steyde in the cytee Indoculpitas Tyll haulfe yearys ende his byers dyd repasse. After, redeamed by monaye great summys Into the howse of the Lorde Putyphrys, By meanys of his ladye hee thyther cummys, Whois name Memphytica remembred ys, So named in Josephs Testament. To the ende withe hym to commytt á mysse; But hee recusinge her luste to content, Shee made hym to suffre imprysonement. Whearwithe that Innocent helde hym pleased, His cause commendynge to God æuerlastynge, Fyndynge hymselfe wondreslye eased From the temptation of fleschely brennynge, Rather contented, in pryson lyinge, Hys handys of that fylthe so clearlye to wesche, Then daungerynge his sowle by followinge the flesche. And thoughe in darkenes hee sate deepe á lowe, As abiecte (in this worlde) or caste áwaye, Withe Hym that the secreatys of hartys dothe knowe Hee was in fauour moste highelye (no naye), And when Hee pleased to appoynte the daye Hee fechte hym owte of the pryson or dyke And set in honour, as noman the lyke. What highe worthynes followed goode Joseph after aduersyteeHee set hym highe vpon Pharaoes steeade, Withe annule on fynger, to signe or to seale, Whois prudent prouydence the worlde dyd feeade That els had perisched thorowe lacke of meale; No lyttle was the comforte hee dyd deale, Suche wondrefull wisedome in hym was fownde To foe and freende his grace dyd so abownde. Hys worthynes yeat the worlde doth recowmpte, Aswell the Heathen as Christyans true; For seruynge Hym, the Highest (that dothe surmounte) Such singular wise can Joseph indwe; And, as Hee Joseph, so saye I vnto yowe, O Josepha, sister vnto the same, For hym resemblynge as wee maye well name. Hee was of bloode, natyuytee and lyne, Of highest in this worlde trulye descended; Nolesse art thowe, thy tytle dothe defyne, Of none on lyne to bee reprehended; At Sixtene yearys age thy greefes accended, From that thy goode Mother her state was put downe, And syns (moste parte) thowe receauydste thy Crowne. For what cawse was Joseph maligned so But for to his Bretherne he was contraryous? He, moste earnestlye, geauyn vertue vnto, And in their doynges they eauer vicyous. So, Badde at Goode are aye litigyous; Thoughe with the Badde the Goode can sumwhat beare, The Badde are farre of á contrarye leare. Whye hathe maligned the Worlde agaynste thee (Ouer whiche the Dyuyll dothe so predomynat), But for thowe woldyste not of his assent bee, Thy sowle in his sorte withe vice to vyolat? Suche on their owne headys dothe exagitat Goddys indignation and scourge of vengeaunce But they (in dwe tyme) please Hym by peanaunce. What goode gote Duddeley, defrawdynge thy right, Of the Duke Duddelaye. Of Sir Thomas Wyatt. Withe all that to hym weare associat? What helped Wyat, that madde Beddelem knyght, To foarse his powre (by pryde) vnto Ludgate? Oather (of late) the sorte insanyat, As Henry Peckham, with Danyell his feare, Of Henry Peckham. By false conspiracye agaynste thee to steeare? Alas! my harte euyn tremblethe withe in mee To see of people the ingratytude! O Henry Peckham! howe happened thee The Dyuyll withe suche blyndenes thee to delude, Thy handys withe treason to bee so embrude, Agaynste thy Mystresse to woorke suche pretence Whiche loued thee, I dare saye in conscyence? Thy Father so worthye and godlye a man, Thy Bretherne also bothe Catholike and goode, Thowe to degenerat, I merueyle than, And yee (as to saye) of one nature and bloode; But (of olde sayinge) happye is the broode In whiche nother theeif nor vnthrifte dothe sprynge: Alas that on thee shoulde happen suche thynge! Thowe, standynge in trowthe (as true subiecte ought), Cowldiste not haue wanted that was conuenyent, For well I wote thy Mystresse hathe in thought Thy Father's seruyce, that was so euydent In neadfull tyme, ere shee had regyment, For his sake tenderinge thy wealthe and woorshippe Tyll into destruction thowe neadys woldiste lippe. But the father (Ezechiel dothe saye) Shall not susteyne the trespasse of the childe; Thy wicked dooynges shall harme hym nowaye, Hys fame shall florische, thoughe thowe bee exilde. Why weare thowe peruerse, why weare thowe so wilde, Leacherous (some saithe) besydys thy wedded wife, Whiche, as others, hathe shortened thy life? Whoe withe his wife cannot bee contented But wyll withe other his luste satisfie, As thoughe from Goddys lawe hee weare exempted, Thoughe Hee not punyschethe theare by and by, He sufferethe suche, as by thee dothe well trye, To fall in some other abomynation, So to receaue digne recompensation. Ceasse suche (I saye) as so yeat dothe practice, Ceasse from so stoorynge Goddys indignation, Ceasse from youre dyuyllische cankered malice, Ceasse from Conspiracyes execration, Ceasse from fowle Heresyes incantation; For, withoute ceassinge from practicynges suche, God will not ceasse youre myseryes to tuche. Howe the Dyuyll dare yee too dooe as yee dooe, Agaynste that that God wyll to entreprise? Shee heere to reigne God is wyllynge theartoo, And yee to the contrarye daylye deuise. God will; yee will not; Wheare dothe this arise But by the Dyuylles so inchauntynge your hartys? Ceasse from suche folye, and playe true mennys partys. Youre dooynges seemethe for Religyons sake:— Cursed bee that Religyon, I saye, That lycencethe men suche vyle wayes to take Their headde to attempte and put so in fraye! Dauyd Sauls cloake but clyppynge wheare hee laye His conscyence greuouslye dyd remorde For so tuchynge thanoynted of the Lorde. But your Religyon attendethe moste cheeif (As well is knowne) to carnall lybertee, Nuryschinge manye á traytor and theeif, Withe all kyndys of vyce that named maye bee, And, as it is all voyde of purytee, (Displeasinge to God That sittethe moste hye) So dothe it conduce to euyll destynye. Yee may by your owne take euydent proofe, And other by yowe if yee not desiste: Clyme not so highe, vpp to the howse roofe, And sodaynlye fall, your footynge beinge myste; To late wylbe to saye then, “Had I wiste”; Vse yowe like subiectes, it shalbe so beste, For, “Blessed are they that lyuethe in reste.” So hathe the wicked disquyeted thee, (O noble Queene!), as the like Joseph dyd, But Josephs God, that thy vsynge dothe see, (Whiche thy God is also, thoughe Hee bee hydde), I fully so truste wyll them nowe forbydde Nomore to torment thyne innocent harte, Bicause thowe suffrest for takynge His parte. Hee wyll them to ceasse by others quaylinge, If eauer they mynde His fauour toptayne, And thee to ceasse from inwardys complaynynge, Bycawse, as Joseph, Hee can thee ordayne To sytt in state moste passynge soueraygne, Aboue all ladyes as Josephe dyd of men, For that, as Josephs, thy life in sorte dothe ren. So blowsterouslye neauer hurlethe the wynde, Noather the salte seayes to rage and to rore, But after great stormys cawlme weather wee fynde; Mennys malice all spett, then hathe they no more. Wheare Trybulation (for Truthe) goethe before, The Peace of God dothe certaynlye succeede, As shall vnto thee withe æuerlastynge meede. So prayethe for thee thy louynge Subiectes all, And all true Christyans I dare vndretake; What thoughe thyne Enemyes then frett at the gall, God and the Goode shall for thy partye make. Of this thowe maiste assuredly make crake, No noble bloode, that any oughtes can preeue, Agaynste thy Majestee dothe stoore or meeue. And ferdre is to bee noted this thynge, Of thy noble Counselours the truthe to saye, Neauer hathe beene seene to drawe by one strynge More stedfastely sure then nowe at this daye, Thy conference withe them they dooe it obeye, For well they wote, as thynges withe the dothe happe, Withe speciall grace God dothe the rownde enwrappe. To Subiectes (that true obedyence dothe meane) To thynke theare vpon is speciall comforte; So longe as the Nobles to thee dothe leane, No passinge bee had to the Prauous sorte, But them to hamper or hawlter vpp shorte, Nomore of them make, sithe Lawe, Loue, nor Dredde, From traytorous pretence their hartes can vnwedde. Inveni hominem secundum cor meum. Dauyd, that was so contentynge Goddys mynde, Seauyn sortes of Synners hee well dyd aduue, Emonges whiche false Rebellys hee dyd owte fynde, Whome vnto deathe hee not let to pursue: As like authorytee restethe in youe, So, wheare no Mercye can wynne them to grace, After their desertes let Justice take place. Suche are not worthye the Commone wealys wealthe That by Rebellyon disturbethe the same; Whoe the Polycie vndremoynethe by stealthe His recompensation the Royalmys lawe dothe name. Better Lawes rygour, á fewe so to tame (That will not them frame by dwe obedyence), Then hundreadys to perische for their lewde offense. As Emendation charytee askethe Wheare Emendation dothe playnlye appeeare, So Justice (of right) dwe penaltee taskethe Wheare malyfactours vngodlye dothe steeare; Whearfore I wische, in Cowntreys farre and neeare, Chrystyan obedyence in dwe sorte to reigne, That Charytee maye aboue Justice optayne. Then shall Goddys glorye florische (as it ought), Then shall thy harte bee in quyet and reste, Then shall weale publike in right trade bee brought, Then shalbe althynges as wee can wische beste, Then shall oure Kynge bee nomore as straunge Geste But, as behoauethe, withe thee tassociat, After oure longinge, issue to procreat; Whois prosperous reuertynge from his countreye Reioycethe the hartes of whoale your subiectes true; In ioye maye yee ioye, I hartelye praye, Yearys longe and manye so to contynue, Issuynge betweene yowe suche worthye issue, This Royalme to keepe from desolation, As best maye serue Goddys contentation, And thowe theareof, ere God for the hense sende, To see the perfecte Education, After thy trade, that it maye after bende When thowe shalte chaunge this habytation, In sorte as thowe takiste imytation After goode Grysilde, thy holye Matrone:— So graunte the Lorde, that highest sittethe in Throne!
