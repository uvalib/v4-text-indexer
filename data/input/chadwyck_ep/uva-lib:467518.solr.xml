      <field name="fulltext">TO ZILLAH MADONNA WATTS THIS VOLUME IS MOST AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED. POETICAL SKETCHES. THE PROFESSION. A SKETCH. For her the Fates, severely kind, ordain A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain; Her life, a long dead calm of fixed repose, No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows. POPE. I On Santa Croce's golden-pillared shrine, A thousand tapers pour their blended rays In one rich tide of radiance. Like a pine, Lifting its lofty head amid the blaze Of sunlit snows, stands forward to the gaze Of the assembled throng, the Priest supreme, In full pontificals. His hand he lays Upon a gorgeous crucifix, the theme Of the oracular words from his pale lips that stream. II Upon his open brow a dignity That well beseems his office is enthroned; And if the brightness of his coal-black eye Is something tamed by time, it must be owned It hath a chastened lustre far beyond The fire of youthful glances;—and if Care, With lines of premature decay, hath crowned His thoughtful forehead, as in fervent prayer He bends, unfailing faith, hope, peace, are beaming there! III The chancel-portals, with a crash, unfold, And a long train of close-veiled nuns pour in, And gather round the palisades of gold That gird that glorious shriving-place for sin. The stately Abbess enters:—then begin Sweet far-off voices on the ear to steal With dim, delicious melodies, that win Their way to the deep heart,—till bursts the swell From organ, harp, voice, lute, in one magnificent peal. IV The chaunt hath ended;—and throughout the throng Heart-hushing silence reigns, and every brow Is raised in keen expectancy.—Ere long, Once more the Pontiff at the shrine doth bow Before the golden crucifix; and now Calls on the fated victim.—She attends The awful summons, and with footstep slow Draws near,—the altar's marble stair ascends,— And on the velvet pall, with knee submissive, bends. V Then breathes the man of God, in eloquent strain, The pious exhortation;—he dilates Upon the wild varieties of pain Which, in each labyrinth of life, awaits ‘The world's tired denizen;’—portrays their fates Whom Pleasure 'witches with her syren charms; And promises to her who dedicates Her youth to God,—from Passion's vain alarms A shield, and sure repose in mild Religion's arms! VI All hearts are stirred,—but chiefly hers who kneels In silent homage there: she lifts her face To Heaven, but still her milk-white veil conceals Its features from the view. Her form of grace, Through its dim, shadowy foldings you may trace, Fair as those curves of beauty in the skies Which speak of Hope when storms are near, and chase The clouds of dark despondency. All eyes Are fixed upon her, now, in pity or surprise: VII For, hark! In measured tones, the convent-bell Booms heavily on the ear. With stooping brow— As mindful of the duty its deep knell Proclaims,—and voice, sweet as the musical flow Of desert waters, she repeats the vow That shuts her from the world. In accents mild, The father questions, if the words that now Are registered on high, are unbeguiled By circumstance or wish, unstable, vain, or wild? VIII She answers him ‘they are.’—'Tis well, he cries, And from the altar takes a golden ring, And, gently bidding the young vestal rise, 'Tis fixed upon her finger.—Then they fling The snow-white veil aside; but ere they bring The last black ensign of the awful rite, In shroudless beauty stands that lovely thing,— A delicate star soft beaming on the sight, Like Hesper when he breaks from curtaining clouds of night. IX O'er her white brow her wandering hair descends In rich unbraided rings;—a coronal Of lilies, wreathed amid each cluster, lends An added grace: and, as at evening's fall Day struggles with th' annihilating pall That darkness would shed o'er it, so the gleam Of her transparent forehead shines through all The chestnut curls that shadow it:—so stream With tremulous light the rays that from her deep eyes beam. X Hers is that nameless loveliness that sinks On the beholder's heart; and if he seeks, Whilst his full glance her blaze of beauty drinks, To know where lurks the charm which thus bespeaks His passionate admiration;—if in cheeks Of rose—or ruby lips—or violet eyes— It is in vain!—Not in the separate streaks Of that rich bow of gathered beauty lies The spell of power, but in its full, united dyes. XI She looks around:—upon her delicate lips A smile of melancholy sweetness plays; But soon a passing thought, in dark eclipse, Hath veiled it from the view;—and now they raise Once more to Heaven the pealing notes of praise: Her eye grows brighter;—on her cheek a flush Of deeper crimson mantles, and her gaze With holy zeal upturns, as the full rush Of the loud organ's tones grows gathering gush on gush. XII And now she joins the choir, whose voices swell, Swell and subside, then rise, and sink again, Like ocean's billows when the winds rebel, And surge on surge prevails. Sudden the strain Hath ceased; as when upon the watery plain The oil of peace is poured, and the waves glide Untroubled on their way. I list in vain! Hushed is, at length, that wild and witching tide, And organ, harp, voice, lute, have into silence died. XIII The sable veil is brought,—the prayer is said; The silken tress and lily wreath removed; And sighs are heaved, and silent tears are shed By friends around, so loving and beloved. Ah! who could view this last sad rite unmoved!— Youth, beauty, virtue, in their earliest prime, Crossing the threshold of a home unproved; Where bigot forms are hallowed but by time, And filial duty ends, and love becomes a crime! XIV Yet she is firm, and with unfailing voice Pours forth the final hymn; and it would seem, Taught by some secret instinct to rejoice That she hath 'scaped the worldling's chequered dream. Religion, now, must be the only theme On which her heart may dwell. Life's darkest ills Can ne'er again disturb the peaceful stream Of her sweet thoughts, delayed Hope's withering chills, Ambition's glittering gauds, nor Passion's thousand thrills, XV Wake discord on her mind's melodious lyre, The convent's portal passed. Perchance her heart Hath been too fiercely chastened in the fire Of love's deep phantasies,—until the smart Bade her all bleeding from the strife depart, And seek nepenthe in a fate like this. What marvel then, if no big tear-drops start; If schooled in sorrow thus she bends submiss; Since whatsoe'er her doom, to that it must be bliss. XVI But see! the altar is deserted now; The crowd pours out from Santa Croce's walls. Behind the gazing throng, with thoughtful brow, I linger yet amid the flower-decked stalls, Deep musing on the past:—the last foot-falls Are faintly echoing o'er the marble floor; Yet, still, some spell my conscious heart enthralls;— At length I slowly gain the closing door, And bid the scene farewell,—now and for evermore! THE BROKEN HEART. A SKETCH. O melancholy Love! amidst thy fears, Thy darkness, thy despair, there runs a vein Of pleasure, like a smile 'midst many tears,— The pride of sorrow that will not complain,— The exultation that in after-years The loved one will discover—and in vain, How much the heart silently in its cell Did suffer till it broke, yet nothing tell? BARRY CORNWALL. I. The hand of Death upon his brow had stamped Its never-changing impress;—yet his cheek Had lost its wonted paleness, and appeared— As if in mockery of the hues of health— Tinged with a crimson flush, which came and went, Like the red streaks of summer's evening sky, When Phœbus floats upon the western wave; And from the depths of his soul-searching eyes, Glances, of more than mortal brightness, beamed On those around him,—till they quailed in fear From his so ardent gaze. Sadness had sunk Into his inmost soul, though none knew why, And few might guess the cause. Some deemed the grave Had terrors for him; but, though he had need (Like other earth-born creatures) of the grace From Heaven to man accorded, no foul crime Hung on his spirit's pinions;—and if grief, Intensest suffering, those wild woes which wring The human heart to breaking, may atone For youthful follies,—then, the fear of death Wrought not the gloom that clouded his young brow. II. But there were other feelings deeply shrined Within his heart of heart;—thoughts he had nursed, Through years, with fond inquietude, and hopes Cherished in passionate silentness;—their source, Love,—fadeless and unquenchable. Long time, He strove, by mixing with the empty crowd, In bowers of heartless revelry, to break The charm that spelled his bosom; for he feared The gentle one he prized, might ne'er be his. Was it the Demon of Fatality That whispered this dark omen in his ear? It might, or might not be; yet still he wove Her name with his rude minstrelsy, and poured Full many a tender strain from his wild lyre, She heeded not—perchance she never heard! III. Was he beloved again?—This, who may tell? 'Tis said, a strange and wayward chance first threw The youth and maid together: she had leaned Upon his arm, and listened to his lays With seeming gladness, and had often praised The earliest wreath of song his muse had twined; And words of gentle import, on the soul Of the young poet, waked a feeling sweet He knew not to define;—they fell like dew Upon the thirsting flowerets of his heart, Giving them strength and freshness; for, till then, The voice of soothing kindness ne'er had shed Its rich, melodious music on his ear! IV. The minstrel loved, but never told the maid His deep devotedness;—for he was one On whom the smiles of Fortune seldom dwelt; And though a Crœsus in his heart, had few Of what the world calls riches; so he quelled, Or strove to quell, the tumult in his breast, And left his gentle Deity, to seek, Not other idols, but forgetfulness! The maiden knew not of his love, unless His passionate glance at parting, when he clasped Her hand in token of farewell, revealed The tale his lips had uttered not. Howbeit, He was not long remembered; for when time, Whose days were years, had passed, and fate again Led him to gaze a moment on the face Of her he loved so well, her eye betrayed No beam of kind acknowledgment, but turned Hurriedly from his. He had not asked for love; But, ah! how little had he looked for scorn! V. He bent him then, in silence, on his way, To where the Alpine monarch, crowned with snows,— The eminent Montblanc—heaves into Heaven Its pure and stainless pinnacle. Amid Nature's stupendous scenes the minstrel roved, And half forgot his sorrows. He would climb The lofty Jura, and from thence look down Upon the world beneath him, till deep thoughts, Passions and feelings, crowded on his mind In swift and numberless succession; but The first, the last, the sweetest, and the best, Was love, though wild and hopeless! He would dwell Intensely on the past, and oft evoke Bright shades of visionary bliss from out The inmost depths of his day-dreaming soul; Till Reason, with her flaming sword, sprang up And drove him from his Paradise of thought. VI. Moons rolled away; yet still it was his choice To make the wilderness his home, and wander 'Mid Nature's giant offspring. When the sun Shed its retiring beams of crimson on The glittering snows that shroud their searchless heights, In breathless admiration, would he mark The last rich halo sinking;—and when day Had left the world to darkness, would return Home to his low-roofed dwelling at the foot Of frowning Jura,—silently to muse On all the wild vicissitudes of life! This might not long endure; back to man's haunts Once more the minstrel, with unwilling feet, Wended;—for there were duties, unfulfilled, The world professed to claim from him, and he Was not disposed to disavow, although They had no charms for him. Again he sought The busy mart, and mingled with the throng,— Was flattered, cheated, and caressed;—now basked Awhile in Fortune's sunshine,—and now mourned His little, lessened by the wiles of those Who prey upon credulity; and this Because he had not learned to hate the world, Nor deem men villains, till he found them such? VII. But heavier woes awaited him: the seeds Of sickness, which Misfortune's hand had sown, Began to germinate. His spirit pined In voiceless anguish, for he scorned complaint; And whilst his lips were wreathed into a smile, The worm of death was preying on his heart. Kinless, and almost friendless, was he left To sink into the grave. No anxious eye To gaze upon his face, and soothe his pain With looks of tenderness. And there was Hope In wild contention with Despair, within The cell of his dark bosom;—and they strove Which might obtain the mastery, till a sweet And calm-browed angel, with her lamp of light, Religion, scared the ravening fiend away! Then were the minstrel's dreams all gentleness, And he could bear to think on years gone by, And those yet hidden in the womb of time! VIII. Still there was one regret, one deep regret, Which haunted his young spirit;—'twas that he, The unowned breathings of whose lyre had wrought Favour with those who knew him not, should speed To his eternal home, nor leave behind A wreath of sweet remembrance for his name;— And so he garlanded the wilding flowers His youthful muse had gathered from the mount Of time-hallowed Aonia, and deemed, Most fondly deemed, his chaplet would find grace (Even for the sake of him who culled its blooms) With one sweet breast at least; since pride might now No longer interpose its chilling chain Between him and the load-star of his love! It was an idle thought:—those simple strains (The only incense he could offer then) Which he had breathed for her in earlier years, Had perished from her memory; and even His name was unremembered now, who never Had parted with a tender thought of her! IX. Such was to be.—They said her vows were given To one of Fortune's favorites, and one Of whom the world and its reports spake fair; Then what had she to do with thoughts of him, Whose only wealth was of the mind;—whose rank Was slight,—unless nobility of soul May cope with blazoned 'scutcheons? It was meet That he should be forgotten—if he e'er Had been remembered, 'till the grave had closed Between him and mankind,—and then his name Might ask the tribute of a tear, nor wrong Those who possessed a title to her smiles! X. Did he reproach her even in thought?—Ah, no! She had not wronged him;—she had vowed no truth To him; and he had never sought to gain Her pity or her love;—nor even revealed Aught that he felt for her; unless, indeed, In years long past, when (though so brief the time Relentless Fate allotted for such bliss) She sometimes leaned upon his arm, and held Sweet converse on the mighty ones of old, (The immortal poets of their native land) With him—that wild enthusiast,—then the fire She kindled in his soul would burst to light, And each deep-rooted sentiment shine out In glances, from his passion-darting eyes! Yet, it may be, she marked them not,—or deemed The mention of their fadeless names who were As stars of his idolatry, called up The deep suffusion of his cheek, and lit His eye with momentary brightness. Once, Ay once, he fancied that the maiden gazed As if she guessed the secret of his soul, And pitied,—almost loved him;—and he clasped The hand that she withheld not,—but was silent!— Why was he mute at such an hour as this? Ye to whom feeling is beyond a name, Perchance, can answer for him! Had the wealth Of ‘Ormus or of Ind’ been his, his love Had surely found a tongue; but as it was, Honour—it may be pride too—made him voiceless! XI. They parted,—never more to meet, as once They had been wont to meet;—yet glorious Hope, That morning-star of Love, put forth its beams— Its beautiful beams of promise,—and the youth, Spite of the clouds that circled it, believed The sun of Fortune, the deep noon of bliss, And the calm evening of subdued delight, Would follow their bright harbinger. But, ah! How many a day of turbulence and gloom Is ushered by the sweet and peaceful rays Of fair Aurora's planet! So it was Even with the minstrel's Lucifer; for soon It shrouded its bright beams, and left his soul To a dark day of ceaseless cloud and storm. XII. They parted;—and, since then, his bark hath ridden The rough and roaring waters of the world; Now whelmed beneath the billows of Despair, Striving with passion's whirlwind; and now dashed With furious violence upon the rocks Hate, and Oppression, and blind Chance have reared Amid the waves of life's tumultuous sea. The tempest hath subsided; and that bark Sailless, not rudderless, with tremulous heave (As mindful of the ills it hath sustained) Now drifts before a mild and favouring gale To its deep haven of repose—the grave! Master of mortal bosoms, Love!—O, Love! Thou art the essence of the universe! Soul of the visible world! and canst create Hope, joy, pain, passion, madness, or despair, As suiteth thy high will! To some thou bringest A balm, a lenitive for every wound The unkind world inflicts on them; to others Thy breath but breathes destruction, and thy smile Scathes like the lightning!—Now a star of peace, Heralding sweet evening to our stormy day; And now a meteor, with far-scattering fire, Shedding red ruin on our flowers of life!— In all— Whether arrayed in hues of deep repose, Or armed with burning vengeance to consume Our yielding hearts,—alike omnipotent! A SKETCH FROM REAL LIFE. What now, to her, is all the world esteems? She is awake, and cares not for its dreams; But moves, while yet on earth, as one above Its hopes and fears—its loathing and its love. CRABBE. 'Tis said she once was beautiful;—and still— For 'tis not years that can have wrought her ill,— Deep rays of loveliness around her form Beam, as the rainbow that succeeds the storm, Brightens a glorious ruin. In her face, Though something touched by sorrow, you may trace The all she was, when first in life's young spring, Like the gay bee-bird on delighted wing, She stooped to cull the honey from each flower That bares its breast in joy's luxuriant bower! O'er her pure forehead, pale as moonlit snow, Her ebon locks are parted,—and her brow Stands forth like morning from the shades of night, Serene, though clouds hang over it. The bright And searching glance of her Ithuriel eye, Might even the sternest hypocrite defy To meet it unappalled;—'twould almost seem As though, epitomized in one deep beam, Her full collected soul upon the heart, Whate'er its mask, she strove at once to dart: And few may brave the talisman that's hid 'Neath the dark fringes of her drooping lid. Patient in suffering, she has learned the art To bleed in silence and conceal the smart; And thence, though quick of feeling, hath been deemed Almost as cold and loveless as she seemed; Because to fools she never would reveal Wounds they would probe—without the power to heal. No,—whatsoe'er the visions that disturb The fountain of her thoughts, she knows to curb Each outward sign of sorrow, and suppress— Even to a sigh—all tokens of distress. Yet some, perhaps, with keener vision than The crowd, that pass her by unnoted, can, Through well-dissembled smiles, at times, discern A settled anguish that would seem to burn The very brain it feeds upon; and when This mood of pain is on her, then, oh! then A more than wonted paleness of the cheek,— And, it may be, a flitting hectic streak,— A tremulous motion of the lip or eye,— Are all that anxious friendship may descry. Reserve and womanly pride are in her look, Though tempered into meekness. She can brook Unkindness and neglect from those she loves, Because she feels it undeserved; which proves, That firm and conscious rectitude hath power To blunt Fate's darts in sorrow's darkest hour. Ay unprovoked injustice she can bear Without a sigh,—almost without a tear, Save such as hearts internally will weep, And they ne'er rise the burning lids to steep; But to those petty wrongs which half defy Human forbearance, she can make reply With a proud lip and a contemptuous eye. There is a speaking sadness in her air, A hue of languor o'er her features fair, Born of no common grief; as though Despair Had wrestled with her spirit—been o'erthrown,— And these the trophies of the strife alone. A resignation of the will, a calm Derived from pure religion (that sweet balm For wounded breasts) is seated on her brow, And ever to the tempest bends she now, Even as a drooping lily, which the wind Sways as it lists. The sweet affections bind Her sympathies to earth; her peaceful soul Has long aspired to that immortal goal, Where pain and anguish cease to be our lot, And the world's cares and frailties are forgot! THE CLOSING SCENE. A SKETCH. Who can bring healing to her heart's despair, Her whole rich sum of happiness lies there! CROLY. Pale is his cheek with deep and passionate thought, Save when a feverish hectic crosses it, Flooding its lines with crimson. From beneath The long dark fringes of its drooping lid Flash forth the fitful glances of his eye, Like star-beams from the bosom of the night. Above his high and ample forehead, float The gloomy folds of his wild-waving hair, Even as the clouds that crown a lofty hill With sterner grandeur. On his quivering 'lid The swelling brow weighs heavily, as though Bursting with thoughts for utterance too intense! His lip is curled with something too of pride, Which ill beseems the meekness and repose That should, at such an hour, within his heart, Spite of this world's vexations, be enshrined. 'Tis not disdain, for only those he loves Are 'round him now, with mild low-whispered words Tendering heart-offered kindnesses,—and watching, With fond inquietude, the couch whereon His slender form reclines. What can it be?— Perchance some rooted memory of the past;— Some dream of injured pride that fain would wreak Its force on dumb expression;—some fierce wrong Which his young soul hath suffered unappeased. But thoughts like these must be dispelled before That soul can plume its wings to part in peace. And now his gaze is lifted to the face Of one who bends above him with an air Of sweet solicitude, and props his head, Even with her own white arm, until at length The sliding pillow is replaced; but, ere His cheek may press on its uneven down, Her delicate hand hath smoothed it. What a theme For those who love to weave the pictured spell, And fix the shadows that would else depart From all but memory, on the tablets fair Of the divine Euterpe! Her blue eyes, With tenderness, grow darker as they dwell Upon the wreck before her;—and a tear, Collected 'neath their fringes, large and bright, Falls on the snow of her high-heaving breast. Too well divineth he the voiceless grief Which breathes in each unbidden sigh, and beams From forth her humid eyes? Too well he knows That love and keen anxiety for him Have paled the ruby of her lip, and chased The rose's dye from her so beautiful cheek. His quivering lips unclose, as if to pour The fond acknowledgments of grateful love On that sweet mourner's ear; but his parched tongue Denies its office. Gathering then each ray, Each vivid ray of feeling from his heart, Into a single focus—in his eye His inmost soul is glassed, and love—deep love, And grateful admiration, beam confessed In one wild passionate glance! The gentle girl Basks her awhile in that full blaze—then stoops, And hiding her pale forehead in his bosom, Murmurs sounds inarticulate, but sweet As the low wail of summer's evening breath Amid the wind-harp's strings. Then bursts the tide Of woe that may no longer be repressed, Stirred from its source by chill, hope-withering fears, And from her charged lids big drops descend In quick succession. With more tremulous hand Clasps she the sufferer's neck. Upon his brow The damps of death are settling,—and his eyes Grow fixed and meaningless. She marks the change With desperate earnestness; and staying even Her breath, that nothing may disturb the hush, Lays her wan cheek still closer to his heart, And listens, as its varying pulses move,— Haply to catch a sound betokening life. It beats—again—another—and another,— And, now, hath ceased for ever! What a shriek— A shrill and soul-appalling shriek peals forth, Now the full truth hath rushed upon her brain! Who may describe the rigidness of frame, The stony look of anguish and despair, With which she bends o'er that unmoving clay? Not I,—my pencil hath no further power: So here I'll drop the Grecian painter's veil! TO OCTAVIA, THE EIGHTH DAUGHTER OF J. LARKING, ESQ. Ah! mayst thou ever be what now thou art, Nor unbeseem the promise of thy spring! LORD BYRON. I Full many a gloomy month hath past, On flagging wing, regardless by, Unmarked by aught, save grief, since last I gazed upon thy bright blue eye, And bade my Lyre pour forth for thee Its strains of wildest minstrelsy? For all my joys are withered now, The hopes, I most relied on, thwarted, And sorrow hath o'erspread my brow With many a shade since last we parted: Yet, 'mid that murkiness of lot, Young Peri, thou art unforgot II There are who love to trace the smile That dimples upon childhood's cheek, And hear from lips devoid of guile, The dictates of the bosom break;— Ah! who of such could look on thee Without a wish to rival me! None;—his must be a stubborn heart, And strange to every softer feeling, Who from thy glance could bear to part Cold and unmoved—without revealing Some portion of the fond regret Which dimmed my eye when last we met! III Sweet bud of Beauty!—'Mid the thrill— The anguished thrill of hope delayed,— Peril—and pain—and every ill That can the breast of man invade,— No tender thought of thine and thee Hath faded from my memory; But I have dwelt on each dear form, 'Till woe, awhile, gave place to gladness, And that remembrance seemed to charm, Almost to peace, my bosom's sadness;— And now, again, I breathe a lay To hail thee on thy natal day! IV O! might the fondest prayers prevail For blessings on thy future years; Or innocence, like thine, avail To save thee from affliction's tears; Each moment of thy life should bring Some new delight upon its wing! And the wild sparkle of thine eye— Thy guilelessness of soul revealing— Beam ever thus, as beauteously, Undimmed—save by those tears of feeling— Those soft, luxuriant drops which flow, In pity, for another's woe! V But vain the wish!—It may not be! Could prayers avert misfortune's blight, Or hearts, from sinful passion free, Here hope for unalloyed delight, Then, those who guard thy opening bloom Had never known one hour of gloom. No:—if the chastening stroke of Fate On guilty heads alone descended, Sure they would ne'er have felt its weight, In whose pure bosoms, sweetly blended, Life's dearest social virtues move, In one bright, endless chain of love! VI Then since upon this earth, joy's beams Are fading—frail, and few in number, And melt—like the light-woven dreams That steal upon the mourner's slumber,— Sweet one! I'll wish thee strength to bear The ills that Heaven may bid thee share; And when thine infancy hath fled, And Time with Woman's zone hath bound thee, If, in the path thou'rt doomed to tread, The thorns of sorrow lurk, and wound thee, Be thine that exquisite relief Which blossoms 'mid the springs of grief! VII And like the many-tinted Bow, Which smiles the showery clouds away, May hope—Grief's Iris here below— Attend, and soothe thee on thy way, Till full of years—thy cares at rest— Thou seek'st the mansions of the blest!— Young Sister of a mortal Nine, Farewell!—Perchance a long farewell! Though woes unnumbered yet be mine,— Woes, Hope may vainly strive to quell,— I'll half unteach my soul to pine, So there be bliss for thee and thine! 1817. CHAMOUNI. A SKETCH ON THE SPOT. The lips that may forget God in the crowd, Cannot forget him here, where he has built For his own glory in the wilderness. WORDSWORTH. I 'Tis Night;—and Silence with unmoving wings Broods o'er the sleeping waters;—not a sound Breaks its most breathless hush. The sweet moon flings Her pallid lustre on the hills around, Turning the snows and ices that have crowned— Since Chaos reigned—each vast untrodden height, To beryl, pearl, and silver;—whilst, profound, In the still, waveless lake, reflected bright, And, girt with arrowy rays, rests her full orb of light. II Th' eternal mountains momently are peering Through the blue clouds that mantle them;—on high, Their glittering crests majestically rearing, More like to children of the infinite sky, Than of the dædal earth.—Triumphantly, Prince of the whirlwind!—Monarch of the scene!— Mightiest where all are mighty!—from the eye Of mortal man half hidden by the screen Of mists that moat his base from Arve's dark, deep ravine, III Stands the magnificent Montblanc! His brow Scarred with ten thousand thunders;—most sublime, Even as though risen from the world below To mark the progress of Decay: by clime, Storm, blight, fire, earthquake injured not! Like Time, Stern chronicler of centuries gone by, Doomed by a heavenly fiat still to climb, Swell and increase with years incessantly, Then yield at length to thee, most dread Eternity! IV Hark! There are sounds of tumult and commotion Hurtling in murmurs on the distant air, Like the wild music of a wind-lashed ocean;— They rage, they gather now; yon valley fair Still sleeps in moonlight loveliness, but there Methinks a form of horror I behold With giant-stride descending! 'Tis Despair, Riding the rushing avalanche; now rolled From its tall cliff,—by whom—what mortal may unfold? V Perchance a gale from fervid Italy Startled the air-hung thunderer; or the tone Breathed from some hunter's horn; or, it may be, The echoes of the mountain cataract, thrown Amid its voiceful snows, have thus called down The overwhelming ruin on the vale. Howbeit a mystery to man unknown, 'Twas but some Heaven-sent power that did prevail, For an inscrutable end, its slumbers to assail. VI Madly it bursts along,—even as a river That gathers strength in its most fierce career; The black and lofty pines a moment quiver Before its breath, but, as it draws more near, Crash—and are seen no more! Fleet-footed Fear, Pale as that white-robed minister of wrath, In silent wilderment her face doth rear; And, having gazed upon its blight and scathe, Flies with the swift Chamois from its death-dooming path. REMEMBER THE PAST! Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy, Bright dreams of the past which she cannot destroy! MOORE. I “Remember the past!”—Oh! since Fate has bereft me Of each star that once beamed on my pathway of life,— Since the storm is abroad, and no beacon is left me To guide my lone bark through the waters of strife,— What can still the black billow, or hush the loud blast, Like the spell that is wreathed with the thoughts of the past? II I have struggled, and wildly, with Hate and with Malice; In the dews of affliction my heart hath been steeped;— I have dregged the last drops of Misfortune's dark chalice, And from seeds of delight only mournfulness reaped;— Yet, 'mid all my wild wanderings, a halo was cast On the gloom of the ‘present’—by thoughts of the past! III When Detraction's keen arrows were rushing around me, And, though Truth was my buckler, had branded my name, When the friends who long years firm and faithful had found me Were the first to upbraid, and o'erwhelm me with blame; What said I?—Conviction will strike them at last;— They once loved me;—I'll turn to the thoughts of the past! IV I have sought in the wine-cup a Lethe for sorrow, And quaffed its warm tide till my spirit grew light; But that mockery of mirth always fled ere the morrow, Leaving nothing behind it but blackness and blight! And 'twere well:—who would wish that oblivion to last, Which with bitter must banish sweet thoughts of the past! V Like the bubbles of brightness which mantle and sparkle, When the juice of the grape in the goblet is gushing, And but shine for a moment, then sullenly darkle,— So the joy wine creates may as gaily be flushing O'er the pale cheek of woe,—but it fleeteth as fast:— Is it so—is it so with sweet thoughts of the past? VI No;—the garland of Memory new beauty discloses, When chastened by sadness and mellowed by years; And though thorns but too frequently mix with the roses Whose stems have been watered and reared by our tears; Let them circle the brow;—sure the pain is surpassed By the gladness we gather from thoughts of the past! VII Then believe me, dear Zillah, there needs not a token To bid my heart dwell on the dream it loves best; For each pulse must be withered, each chord must be broken, Ere the stamp of thy loveliness fade from my breast. Yes! I'll think of thee, gentle and kind as thou wast, And the ‘joy of my grief’ shall be thoughts of the past! VIII 'Twas thine, when dark Fate, one by one, had been stealing Each hope I most cherished and clung to on earth, To unchain with thy glance the chilled fountain of feeling, And restore its locked tide to light, sunshine, and mirth. Gloom again is upon me;—my soul is o'ercast;— But there's balsam and bliss in the thoughts of the past! IX When we met, thy young brow with deep sadness was clouded,— Yet though pensive thy smiles, they were grateful to me; And the bud woe's long winter had icily shrouded, Burst to bloom in an instant when glanced on by thee: Though the Simoom hath sped, and hath breathed its hot blast, There are blooms still unwithered—the thoughts of the past! X Is the friendship sincerer—the love more enduring, Which years of probation alone can create, Than that which springs up, with a moment's maturing, In bosoms with passion and feeling elate? Surely not!—If it is—what care I, so thou hast Pleasure, thrilling, as I have, in thoughts of the past! XI But it never may be! In souls ardent as ours, When the seeds of affection have once been implanted, A morning's bright sun-shine will call up the flowers, And prove, plainly, 'twas warmth and not ages they wanted;— And though clouds burst above them, their blossoms will last, And gain freshness and strength from the thoughts of the past! XII Fare thee well!—Fare thee well!—If these wild-woven numbers May claim a fond place in a bosom so pure, Till death from mortality's coil disencumbers Thy soul,—and earth's dreams may no longer endure, Let the glass of thy mind give thee back, undefaced By time, absence, or sorrow, the thoughts of the past! XIII Fare thee well!—Fare thee well!—Whilst a pilgrim I wander, Unsoothed and unloved on this cold-hearted earth, On the hour we first met, and last parted, I'll ponder, Till visions of gladness from grief shall have birth;— Whatsoe'er may betide me, life's sands to their last Must have sped, ere I cease to remember the past! YEARS OF ANGUISH AND GLOOM HAVE GONE BY. I will not court Lethean streams My sorrowing sense to steep, Nor drink oblivion to the themes O'er which I love to weep. LOGAN. I Years of anguish and gloom have gone by Since I last drank the breath of thy sigh; And—compelled by hard Fortune to sever,— We parted in sadness—for ever! II What a host of remembrances rush On my brain,—and my tears how they gush, When in solitude's hour I dwell On thy wild but prophetic ‘Farewell!’ III Yes, ‘for ever’ thou saidst, though I deemed Fortune kinder, perchance, than she seemed; And, chiding thy fears with a kiss, Bade thee dim not those moments of bliss! IV Even then death's dark web was around thee; The spells of the spoiler had bound thee; And the Angel from Heaven that brings Fate's last fiat—was waving his wings! V We parted.—What pen may portray The despair that o'ershadowed that day! And even deeper our grief had been then, Had we known we should meet not again! VI We parted.—Long years have now past Since the hour that I gazed on thee last; But, fresh in my memory, yet Bloom the flowers of most mournful regret! VII 'Tis said, that for sorrow's worst sting Time a swift-healing balsam can bring;— That earth's ills all must own his dominion, And recede when they're touched by his pinion! VIII Could the power of Oblivion control All the gloom that oppresses my soul; Could even Time with his wing interpose, And freeze feeling's bright fount as it flows;— IX I would scorn the hard chain that must chill In my bosom affection's fond thrill; For the boon were ungrateful to me, If it banished one sweet dream of thee! X But this thought shall afford me relief, In my moments of passion and grief, That—whate'er be the depth of my woes— They can never disturb thy repose! XI No:—the venom-dipped arrows of doom Cannot pierce to thy heart through the tomb; And, though bitter, 'tis balm to my breast, To know, thou'rt for ever at rest! XII No:—the clouds that burst over me now Cannot ruffle thy beautiful brow;— In its sorrows my soul may repine;— They can wake no wild echoes in thine! XIII Let the storms of adversity lour! So that thou hast escaped from their power; They may pour forth their wrath on my head!— They can break not the sleep of the dead. XIV And the poison of Envy and Malice, May still further imbitter Life's chalice; But the cup, with a smile, shall be quaffed, Since thou liv'st not to share in the draught! STANZAS. FROM THE ITALIAN. I Yes! Pride of soul shall nerve me now, To think of thee no more; And coldness steel the heart and brow That passion swayed before! Think'st thou that I will share thy breast, Whilst dwells a fondlier cherished guest Deep in its inmost core? No;—by my hopes of Heaven, I'll be All—all—or nothing unto thee! II Thy hand hath oft been clasped in mine,— Fondly, since first we met; My lip hath even been pressed to thine— In greeting wild;—but yet, Lightly avails it, now, to tell Of moments only loved too well— Joys I would fain forget, Since Memory's star can ill control The moonless midnight of my soul! III But I'll reproach thee not;—Farewell! Whilst yet I'm somewhat free, 'Twere better far to break the spell That binds my soul to thee, Than wait till Time each pulse shall lend A strength that will not let it bend To Reason's stern decree: Since Fate hath willed that we must part, 'Twere better now to brave the smart. IV Not seldom is the soul depressed Whilst tearless is the eye; For there are woes that wring the breast When Feeling's fount is dry;— Sorrows that do not fade with years, But—dwelling all too deep for tears— Rankle eternally!— Such now as in my bosom swell, Read thou in this wild word,—Farewell! TO A POETICAL FRIEND. Be not over exquisite To cast the fashion of uncertain evils; For, grant they be so, while they rest unknown. Why need a man forestall his date of grief, And run to meet what he would most avoid? MILTON. I All hail, dear friend! The winds are singing The year's wild requiem fitfully And Autumn, now, is swiftly winging Her golden flight, o'er the heaving sea, To some lovelier clime than this;—in sadness Of heart, I gaze on her farewell beam;— But away! This strain shall be one of gladness! I'll startle thee not with a selfish theme! II All hail, dear friend!—Though clouds may lour, And wintry storms descend awhile, Ere long shall Spring resume her power, And Summer come on with her radiant smile. Then a truce to gloom;—though a shade of sorrow May darken our beams of bliss to-day,— Heed it not!—Joy's sun will rise to-morrow, And chase each deepening tint away! III Shall we, whose hearts of warmth and feeling Vibrate to Pleasure's tenderest touch, Supinely grieve, that Fate's hand is stealing Some flowers of life—we have loved too much? Shalt thou—who cleav'st, with eagle pinion, The loftiest skies that Genius knows, Stoop thy plume of pride to the base dominion Of each ruffian blast that beneath thee blows? IV Forbid it, ye who prompt the numbers That soothe the Bard in his wildest mood!— Forbid it, ye who on his slumbers In dreams of glory and light intrude! No;—hearts that each thrill of joy may waken Should, bear unmurmuring, Sorrow's sting; Nor Genius from its height be shaken By every buffet from Fortune's wing! STANZAS TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM POWER WATTS, AGED THREE YEARS. Sweet flower! with flowers I strew thy narrow bed! Sweets to the sweet! Farewell! SHAKSPEARE. I A cloud is on my heart and brow,— The tears are in my eyes,— And wishes fond, all idle now, Are stifled into sighs;— As musing on thine early doom, Thou bud of beauty snatched to bloom, So soon, 'neath milder skies! I turn—thy painful struggle past— From what thou art to what thou wast! II I think of all thy winning ways, Thy frank but boisterous glee;— Thy arch sweet smiles,—thy coy delays,— Thy step, so light and free,— Thy sparkling glance, and hasty run, Thy gladness when thy task was done, And gained thy mother's knee;— Thy gay, good-humoured, childish ease, And all thy thousand arts to please! III Where are they now?—And where, oh where, The eager fond caress? The blooming cheek, so fresh and fair, The lips, all sought to press?— The open brow, and laughing eye,— The heart that leaped so joyously? (Ah! had we loved them less!) Yet there are thoughts can bring relief, And sweeten even this cup of grief. IV What hast thou 'scaped?—A thorny scene! A wilderness of woe! Where many a blast of anguish keen Had taught thy tears to flow! Perchance some wild and withering grief, Had sered thy summer's earliest leaf, In these dark bowers below! Or sickening chills of hope deferred, To strife thy gentlest thoughts had stirred! V What hast thou 'scaped?—Life's weltering sea, Before the storm arose; Whilst yet its gliding waves were free From aught that marred repose! Safe from the thousand throes of pain,— Ere sin or sorrow breathed a stain Upon thine opening rose! And who can calmly think of this, Nor envy thee thy doom of bliss? VI I culled from home's beloved bowers, To deck thy last long sleep, The brightest-hued, most fragrant flowers That summer's dews may steep:— The rose-bud—emblem meet—was there,— The violet blue, and jasmine fair, That drooping, seemed to weep;— And, now, I add this lowlier spell:— Sweets to the passing sweet! Farewell! MORNING. A SKETCH. Yet hath the morning sprinkled through the clouds But half her tincture; and the soil of night Hangs still upon the bosom of the air. CHAPMAN. From out the purple portals of the East, Peers the first dawn of day upon the world, With dim, uncertain light. Huge clouds still wrap The base of fiery Stromboli;—and Night, With her black waving pennons, lingers yet, Far in the western hemisphere.—Long trains Of tremulous mist curtain the deep blue breast Of Adria's waveless ocean. Some repose, In folds fantastically graceful, on The glassy waters;—others, slowly wind Their way in silvery circuitings to heaven; And, as in mockery of the glance that strives To trace their airy wanderings, dissolve, Invisibly, whilst yet the gazer's eye Strains its intensest nerve. Light breaks, With giant stride, upon the earth, and breathes The breath of life into the stagnant veins Of slumber-locked creation. Yon white clouds, That seem to rise like mountains from the sea, Garbed with untrodden snows, suddenly grow Radiant with streaks of gold;—a deeper blush Of crimson now pervades them, and the sun, Lifting his orb above the wave, looks out In glory on the world! Nature around Hath wakened from her trance, and shaking off The night dews from her beauty, stands revealed In rainbow-tinted loveliness to man. EVENING. A SKETCH. The holy time is quiet as a Nun, Breathless with adoration! WORDSWORTH. 'Tis Evening.—On Abruzzo's hill The summer sun is lingering still,— As though unwilling to bereave The landscape of its softest beam,— So fair,—one can but look and grieve To think, that like a lovely dream, A few brief fleeting moments more Must see its reign of beauty o'er! 'Tis Evening;—and a general hush Prevails, save when the mountain spring Bursts from its rock, with fitful gush, And makes melodious murmuring;— Or when from Corno's height of fear, The echoes of its convent bell Come wafted on the far-off ear With soft and diapason swell. But sounds so wildly sweet as they, Ah, who would ever wish away?— Yet there are seasons when the soul, Rapt in some dear delicious dream, Heedless what skies may o'er it roll, What rays of beauty round it beam, Shuts up its inmost cell;—lest aught However wondrous, wild, or fair, Shine in—and interrupt the thought, The one deep thought that centres there! Though with the passionate sense, so shrined And canonized, the hues of grief Perchance be darkly, closely twined, The lonely bosom spurns relief! And could the breathing scene impart A charm to make its sadness less, 'Twould hate the balm that healed its smart, And curse the spell of loveliness That pierced its cloud of gloom, if so It stirred the stream of thought below. WOMAN. AN EPISODE. I'm fond of little girls; I should not say Of little only, for I have for all Ladies a tender penchant, whether they Be young or old, thin, fat, or short, or tall;— But here the meaning I would fain convey Is, that I love them when they're young and small,— Just at that age when Life's delicious bud Begins to burst the bonds of babyhood! The April of existence! When the eye Is bright and unacquainted with a tear, Save such as hope can in an instant dry; The brow and bosom ever calm and clear,— Or if disturbed, but like the changing sky Of that first delicate season of the year, Dim for a moment—in the next to shine With added grace, and lustre more divine. There is a blue-eyed cherub whom my Muse In earlier hours hath sung of, in whose cheeks, Collected in one blaze, the rainbow hues Of childish beauty beam, like the rich streaks Of the deep East at sunrise: I did use To fondle this arch prattler, watch her freaks And infant playfulness, until I grew Enamoured of the blossom ere it blew. And oft in after-times, when years had rolled On their eternal way, and cares came on,— When Fortune frowned, and summer friends grew cold,— Have my thoughts turned upon this youthful one,— This early bud,—this babe of five years old,— With sweet and tender yearnings! Fate hath strown Full many a thorn upon my path below, Since last I kissed her bright and sparkling brow! I cannot say I'm partial to a boy, At any age; I've noticed from his birth, There's always an admixture of alloy In Man;—his clay would seem of coarser earth Than our all-wise Creator did employ In moulding our first mother. There's a dearth Of kindliness in him;—the sordid elf Too often thinks—plans—acts—but for himself! Whilst Woman—gentle Woman, has a heart Fraught with the sweet humanities of life; Swayed by no selfish aim she bears her part In all our joys and woes;—in pain and strife Fonder and still more faithful! When the smart Of care assails the bosom,—or the knife Of ‘keen endurance’ cuts us to the soul, First to support us—foremost to console! Oh! what were Man in dark misfortune's hour Without her cherishing aid?—A nerveless thing, Sinking ignobly 'neath the passing power Of every blast of Fortune. She can bring ‘A balm for every wound.’ As when the shower More heavily falls, the bird of eve will sing In richer notes; sweeter is woman's voice When through the storm it bids the soul rejoice! Is there a sight more touching and sublime Than to behold a creature, who, till grief Had taught her lofty spirit how to climb Above vexation,—and whose fragile leaf, Whilst yet 'twas blooming in a genial clime, Trembled at every breath, and sought relief If Heaven but seemed to lour,—suddenly, Grow vigorous in misfortune, and defy The pelting storm, that in its might comes down To beat it to the earth;—to see a rose Which in its summer's gaiety a frown Had withered from its stem, 'mid wintry snows Lift up its head undrooping, as if grown Familiar with each chilling blast that blows Across the waste of life—and view it twine Around man's rugged trunk its arms divine! It is a glorious spectacle!—A sight Of power to stir the chords of generous hearts To feeling's finest issues; and requite The bosom for all world-inflicted smarts. Such is dear Woman! When the envious blight Of Fate descends upon her, it imparts New worth—new grace;—so precious odours grow, Sweeter when crushed—more fragrant in their woe! So much for Man's sweet consort,—Heaven's best gift, Beloved and loving Woman! Even a thought Of her, not seldom, hath the power to lift My soul above the toils the world hath wrought Round its aspiring wings.—But I'm adrift; Again have left my hero! Well, 'tis nought; Wiser than I have wandered from their way When Woman was the star that led astray! EUROPA. FROM A PAINTING BY GUIDO IN THE DULWICH GALLERY. Her golden ringlets float around her form In bright but wild profusion; some repose In radiant clusters on her stainless breast, Like the rich beams of summer's noonday sun On rocks of alabaster;—others stream (Pennons of beauty to a bark of love) Loose to the ocean breezes. Her blue eyes, Lit with intenser and more passionate thought Than would beseem the wonted air of peace That characters her countenance, dart forth Glances of wilderment—it may be fear On the wild waves behind her; and she clings Closer and closer to the stately neck Of that imperial spurner of the spray,— That lord of lowing herds, the milk-white bull! With unremitting speed the godlike brute, Rejoicing in his glorious freight, moves on:— What are the waves to him? they may not stay His ardent course;—the warring winds may howl With fitful violence round the vessel's prow, And turn it from its track;—the whirlpool's depths May draw it down to never-ending night; But all their powers conjoined may ne'er prevail Over this living, beauty-crested bark, Which proudly dashes on—and on—and on— To where the towers of Crete lift up their heads Above the dark blue sea. With what a front— A stern unyielding front—he stems the wave, And strains each lusty nerve to gain the strand, Now swelling on his sight! Well may we 'count The Boy-God's power omnipotent, since he (And sure those witching fables that would prove His force on human hearts, we half deem true) Could thus stir up in an immortal's breast His deep-pervading passion, and incite Even the Almighty Jove to change his form— His own majestic seeming—and imbrute His mighty spirit in a coil like this, All for an earthly maiden. LINES WRITTEN BENEATH A PICTURE. I Nay, reproach me not, sweet one! I still am thine own, Though the world in its toils hath detained me awhile! The deep vision that spelled my lone bosom is flown, And—a truant to love—I return to thy smile. It hath ever been thus;—when condemned or deceived By the many I scorned, or the few that I loved; Whilst I breathed my contempt, or in silentness grieved, It was bliss to remember whose truth I had proved; And the falsehood of friends, the crowd's hollow decree, Served to bind me more fondly and firmly to thee! II Yes, I still am thine own:—though I sometimes may mingle, In lightness of spirit, with fools I despise; In my heart—my dark heart—dwelling silent and single, Is the thought of all others it soothes me to prize. If I join the loud throng in its madness of mirth, I but think how much purer our pleasures have been;— If I gaze on the fair-bosomed daughters of earth, 'Tis to turn to thy beauties—of beauty the Queen! And if from man's dwellings to Nature I flee, Glen, mountain, and ocean, seem breathing of thee! III When a soft soothing glance from the eye of Affection Breaks my midnight of gloom with its halo divine, How surpassingly sweet is the fond recollection Of the passionate love ever beaming from thine!— 'Twill beam on me no more.—Yet though Death has bereft me Of a form such as seraphs from heaven might adore,— In this image thy features of beauty are left me, And the lines of thy soul in my heart's core of core! Then reproach me not, sweet one! for time shall not see The hour that estranges one deep thought of thee! POSTHUMOUS FAME. WRITTEN AFTER PERUSING A PARAGRAPH RESPECTING THE MONUMENT RECENTLY ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF BURNS. It is a well-known fact, that bards have ever, From Homer downwards, lived upon their wits; And though, no doubt, they always have been clever At brandishing their knives and forks, tid bits Of calipash or venison have never, Or seldom, been reserved for them; and spits With good roast joints not often have been turning For them, men deem the beacon-lights of learning. Their's have been fame and flattery alone, (But pudding is more nourishing than praise;) They've asked for bread, and oft received—a stone! Living, have passed unheeded through the maze Of a cold-hearted world:—their deaths once known, The titled fool hath forward pressed to raise Tombs o'er their ashes, that he thus might claim One leaf of laurel for his paltry name. Shades of the mighty dead! arise and say How much ye scorn such mockery!—Stand forth, Ye heirs of immortality! that they, The proud, who deem nobility of birth Surpasses rank of mind, no longer may Cherish the weak delusion, but to worth Yield, as becomes them, precedence—and learn To honour those whom they were wont to spurn. Match me among the Magnates of the world— Those things of splendid nothingness—bright names, Who, when the roll of glory is unfurled, Upon posterity can show such claims As Milton, Shakspeare, Spenser. Those have hurled Some fellow-despots from their thrones, their aims Still purchased but with blood; and they have made, Their worship of the shadow of a shade; But these, the Muses' sons, have toiled to gain Renown which could not profit them;—through years Of unregarded poverty and pain,— Slaves to their wild and passionate hopes and fears,— Oh! how intensely did they strive to' attain Fame that should be immortal; and the tears Of blood their hearts have wept, have been repaid With wreaths of laurel that can never fade! A FAREWELL. Have we not loved, as none have ever loved, And must we part, as none have ever parted? MATURIN. I Yes,—I will join the world again, And mingle with the crowd; And though my mirth may be but pain, My laughter, wilderment of brain,— At least it shall be loud! II 'Tis true, to bend before the shrine Of heartless revelry, Is slavery to a soul like mine; Yet better thus in chains to pine, Than ever crouch to thee! III Ay, better far to steep the soul In pleasure's sparkling tide; Bid joy's unholy sounds control The maddening thoughts that o'er it roll, Than wither 'neath thy pride. IV Yet I have loved thee—ah, how well! But words are wild and weak; The depth of that pervading spell, I dare not trust my tongue to tell,— And hearts may never speak! V The stubborn pride, none else might rein, Hath stooped to love and thee; But, as the pine upon the plain, Bent by the blast, springs up again, So shall it fare with me. VI Still, whilst I darkly sojourn here, Spite of each vain endeavour, Thy name, through many a future year, Will be the knell, to my lonely ear, Of bliss—gone by for ever! VII Though thou hast wrapped me in a cloud, Nought now may e'er dispel, In silentness my wrongs I'll shroud, And love, reproach, pain, passion, crowd Into one word—Farewell! VIII 'Tis done—the task of soul is taught; At length I've burst the spell, Which, round my heart so firmly wrought, Fettered each loftier, nobler thought; And now, Farewell—Farewell! STANZAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON THE ENVELOPE TO A LOCK OF HAIR. I Pledge of a love as pure and deep As ever thrilled in mortal breast! I would not, could I break thy sleep, Recall thee from the couch of rest, Where thou art now in peace reclining, A stranger to the world's repining! II No! Bright as was thy brief career, In this wild waste of storm and gloom,— And much as I have wished thee here, My soul's dark sorrows to illume,— In loneliness I'd rather languish, Than have thee here to share my anguish! III Besides, would even Heaven allow Thy advent to this earth again; That boon to thee were cruel now, Since human ills—a numerous train— Would cross thee in thy path of life, And stir thy young sweet thoughts to strife! IV Yet looking on this sun-bright tress Unlocks the source of dried-up tears; And thoughts, intense and maddening, press On my hot brain;—though hopes or fears, Since thou and thy sweet mother perished, Have ne'er by me been felt or cherished. V Blossom of Love! Yes, on my mind Strange and unusual feelings rush; The flood-gates of my heart unbind, And bid its waters wildly gush,— As gazing on these threads I see The all that now remains of thee! VI Blossom of Love! Farewell!—Farewell! I go to join the noisy throng; But, in my soul's deep—inmost cell, Thoughts that to thine and thee belong, Will ever bloom as fresh and fair As when they first were planted there! VII And, oh, if tears of woe may nourish The flowers of Memory in the breast; Then those in mine will surely flourish, And each succeeding hour invest Their stems with charms unknown before,— Till we three meet to part no more! FORGET THEE? NO, NEVER! Wrong thee, Bianca? No, not for the earth! Not for earth's brightest! MILMAN. Forget thee?—No, never!—Why cherish a thought To the friend of thy soul, with injustice so fraught? Why embitter our fast-fading moments of bliss By suspicion so wild and unfounded as this? Forget thee?—No, never!—Among the light-hearted, Love may sink to decay when the fond ones are parted; But affection like ours is too deep and sublime, To be chilled in its ardour by absence or time. Then, gentle one, banish all doubt from thy breast: By the kiss that so late on thy lips I impressed,— By the griefs that have blighted the bloom of my years,— By the hope that still calls forth a smile thro' my tears,— By the hour of our parting—thus sweetly delayed,— By truth firmly tried—and by trust unbetrayed,— I will not forget thee!—till life's latest ray In the dark night of death shall have melted away; 'Mid ambition—fame—fortune—and power,—and gladness,— Pain,—and peril—and hate—and contention—and sadness;— Though changes the darkest and brightest betide,— Thy friendship shall soothe me, thy counsels shall guide, And thy memory at once be my solace and pride! CYTHNA. The glassy splendour of her eye Already sparkled of the sky; The kindling of a world of bliss, For it was not the light of this. WIFFEN. Yes, in her eye there lived until the last, A strange, unreal light,—a fearful glance, Wild, yet most beautiful;—and o'er her cheek Hues of such passing loveliness would stray, As seemed not of this earth; but rather caught Like the electric beams that dart across The roseate clouds of Summer's softest eve— From the high heaven above! Upon her lip Hung ‘bland persuasion’ eloquently mute; And, in her very silentness there dwelt Music's best half,—expression! She had borne, With an untiring spirit, many a grief; And sickness, that had wasted her fine form, Had tainted not her soul, for that was pure As the last tear which Pity draws from Love. LINES, WRITTEN IN THE ANGEL OF THE WORLD. I It is a sunny vision—a deep dream— Too full of beauty for the heart to dwell, Unpained, upon the dazzling rays that stream Around the Bard's creations! Music's swell Voluptuous on the ear;—the camel-bell, Borne softly on the distance;—banners bright, Instinct with gems;—that angel ere he fell, And starry Eblis,—in their mingled might, Deluge each weary pulse with too intense delight. II We turn away with dim, delirious sense From that so fervid blaze; and seek repose From Eastern splendour and magnificence, From gorgeous palaces and clouds of rose, Sceptres and thrones, and diamond-crested brows,— Pluming our spirits' pinions at the page, Where sweet Floranthe warbles forth her woes, In strains, of power each turbulent thought to 'suage, And bid the passions cease their fierce, wild war, to wage! III Surpassing Lyrist! from thy powerful hand, The thunders and keen lightnings of the Muse Speed forth in glorious might!—Thou canst command The noon-tide burst of poesy;—yet infuse Its twilight calms and bloom-refreshing dews Amid thy deep conceptions; and canst braid Wreaths, rich and bright, with variegated hues, As those on an Arabian Heaven displayed, Ere day's last rainbow-beams have vanished into shade! AUTUMN. Now Winter from her throne is hurling The deep-voiced matron of the year; And fitful gusts are wildly whirling Her yellow hues on high; though here, In many a fold of beauty streaming, It lingers still:—whilst from her eye The watery light of love is beaming As bright—but, oh, as transiently; Filling the bosom with a sadness, Though born of grief—allied to gladness. II Yes, Autumn's gloom to me is dearer Than Spring, or Summer's sunniest smile; And speaks a language far sincerer Than their all cloudless skies. The wile Of Hope—life's darkly chequered vision,— Its passions, follies, pains, and fears; Its dimness and its quick transition,— Methinks, are emblemed in her tears, Her bright though fading hues, and even The tempests that deform her heaven. November, 1819. STANZAS FOR MUSIC. II. 'TIS EVE ON THE OCEAN. WELSH MELODY.—AIR, ‘THE ASH GROVE.’ I 'Tis eve on the ocean, The breeze is in motion, And briskly our vessel bounds forth on its way;— The blue sky is o'er us, The world is before us, Then Ellen, my sweet one, look up and be gay! Why sorrow thus blindly, For those who unkindly Could launch, and then leave us on life's troubled sea; Who so heartlessly scanted The little we wanted, And denied us the all that we asked—to be free! But we've 'scaped from their trammels,—the word is ‘Away!’ Then Ellen, my sweet one, look up and be gay! II On, on we are speeding, While, swiftly receding, The white cliffs of Albion in distance grow blue; Now that gem of earth's treasures,— That scene of past pleasures,— The home of our childhood, fades fast from our view. Yet still thy heart's swelling, My turtle-eyed Ellen! What recks it to us that we leave it behind? Dark ills may betide us, But Fate cannot guide us Where foes are more bitter, or friends are less kind Than we've found them at home;—but the word is ‘Away!’ Then Ellen, my sweet one, look up and be gay! III Now twilight comes 'round us, And dimness hath bound us, And the light-house looks forth from its surf-beaten height, Like Hope's gentle beamings, Through Sorrow's deep dreamings, Or the load-star of Memory to hours of delight. Though, self-exiled, we sever From England for ever, We'll make us a home and a country afar; And we'll build us a bower Where stern Pride hath no power, And the rod of Oppression our bliss may not mar. We have broken our chain,—and the word is ‘Away!’ Then Ellen, my sweet one, look up and be gay! III. WHILE I UPON THY BOSOM LEAN. I While I upon thy bosom lean, And gaze into thine eyes, I turn from sorrows that have been, To those which yet may rise:— I think on thy untiring truth, And faster flow my tears; I mark thy waning rose of youth, And cannot hide my fears. II Oh! light have been the pangs we've proved, To what may yet remain; We've suffered much—but fondly loved;— Parted—but met again! Still, something speaks a wilder doom From which we ne'er may flee; Well—dearest—let the thunder come, So that it spares me thee! III Even while I clasp thee to my soul, And feel thou'rt wholly mine, The bodings I may not control My lip breathes out on thine: Thy drooping lid—and pallid brow— The frequent gathering tear,— With voiceless eloquence, avow That I have much to fear. IV And when to this I add the thought Of parting soon again, The future, as the past, seems fraught With undivided pain;— But no! I will not dwell upon Such dreams while blest with thee; This hour is bright and all our own, Whate'er the next may be. V. SACRED MELODY. THERE IS A THOUGHT. I There is a thought can lift the soul Above the dull cold sphere that bounds it,— A star, that sheds its mild control Brightest when Grief's dark cloud surrounds it,— And pours a soft, pervading ray Life's ills may never chase away! II When earthly joys have left the breast, And even the last fond hope it cherished Of mortal bliss—too like the rest— Beneath Woe's withering touch hath perished, With fadeless lustre streams that light; A halo on the brow of night! III And bitter were our sojourn here In this dark wilderness of sorrow, Did not that rainbow-beam appear, The herald of a brighter morrow; A merciful beacon from on high To guide us to Eternity! 1815. VII. WHEN SHALL WE MEET AGAIN? I When shall we meet again,— Meet ne'er to sever? When will Peace wreathe her chain Round us for ever? When will our hearts repose, Safe from each blast that blows, In this dark vale of woes? Never,—no, never! II Pride's unrelenting hand Soon will divide us, Moments like these be banned, Trysting denied us. Force may our steps compel, Hearts will not say farewell, Can Power affection quell? Never,—no, never! III By the thrice hallowed past, Love's tenderest token;— By bliss, too sweet to last, Faith, yet unbroken;— By all we're doomed to bear;— By this sad kiss and tear;— I will forget thee, dear, Never,—no, never! IV If thou'rt as true to me, Fond and firm hearted, Hate's dull desires will be Half of them thwarted. When shall we meet again?— When shall we meet again?— In this wide world of pain Never,—no, never! V But where no storms can chill, False friends deceive us; Where with protracted thrill Hope cannot grieve us; There with the pure of heart, Safe from Fate's venomed dart, There we may meet to part Never,—no, never! VIII. COME, LET US BANISH SORROW. WELSH MELODY.—AIR, THE ‘MINSTRELSY OF CHIRK CASTLE.’ I Come, let us banish sorrow, Nor think about to-morrow! This hour so bright, May well requite Our hearts for the past; And as for future sadness, Why should we mar our gladness, With boding fears, With sighs and tears, Lest bliss should not last? What though Fortune frown on us, or friends prove unkind, We can never be poor, love, with wealth of the mind; We can never be lonely—though all should depart, Whilst we live in the pulse-peopled world of the heart. II What can there be to grieve thee? Thou know'st I'll ne'er deceive thee; Am I not thine? Then why repine? Say, what wouldst thou more? Can fate have power to harm thee? Can life's dark ills alarm thee? Am I not near To shield thee, dear? Say, what wouldst thou more? Then a truce to all gloom, we'll be cheerful and gay, Nor welcome the griefs that are yet on their way; Let them come, at their leisure, we'll smile while we may, And, in spite of to-morrow, be happy to-day! IX. AND DOST THOU LOVE THE LYRE. I And dost thou love the Lyre, Those strains the Nine inspire? Ah! beware the spell, Some have proved too well, Nor follow a wandering fire, Mary! II For genius is only a dream, An ignis fatuus gleam, That just lends its light; But when sorrow's night Is deepest—withdraws its beam, Mary! III 'Tis a passionate sense refined, That spells the enthusiast's mind; That bids him cope With life's storms, and hope For a haven he never may find, Mary! IV As the hues of the mimic bow, Arching the cataract's brow, Though they gaily shine,— And seem half divine, Are but types of the chaos below, Mary! V So the glittering tints that rest, On Genius' star-bright crest, May lovelily glow, While despair and woe Hold their strife in his lonely breast, Mary! VI Some have envied the Minstrel's art, Unknowing his oft-felt smart; But this never might be, Could they once but see A minstrel's inmost heart, Mary! VII It hath fibres so finely wrought, And depths with such feelings fraught, That a word may break, Or to melody wake Each chord in that Lyre of thought, Mary! VIII Even when Pleasure her fingers flings O'er its most attenuate strings, In the passionate swells Which her touch compels, It oft wails while to gladness it rings, Mary! IX But when Sorrow's ruthless hand Doth its tremulous chords command, They break in her clasp, For so rude a grasp They never were formed to withstand, Mary! X Then do not love the Lyre, Those strains the Nine inspire, But beware the spell, Some have proved too well, Nor follow a wandering fire, Mary! X. MY RACE IS ALMOST RUN. I My race is almost run, my days are nearly done, Yet my heart still is buoyant, my spirits are light,— It is but as the blaze of a dying taper's rays, Life's last vivid flash ere it fades into night! II In my day-spring of youth, with a bosom full of truth, And feelings unwarped or unwithered by wrong; With every sail unfurled, o'er the waves of the world My bark of existence sped gaily along. III My pilot was Hope, and I fancied I could cope, If guided by him, with that storm-troubled sea; Till dashed on Passion's rock, and shattered by the shock, I soon found how unskilful a helmsman was he. IV But years have flitted past, and tried in many a blast, We both have grown wiser and steadier than of yore; The rack hath o'er us rolled, and now cheerily we hold For a haven from whence we shall wander no more. V My days are well nigh done, my goal will soon be won, And repose from the buffets of Fortune be mine; Where Hate, however fierce, or Sorrow may not pierce, To bid my cold bosom a moment repine. VI O Death! I can brook on thine awful front to look, And can turn to thee now with a heart void of gloom; To him whom Time can bring no balsam on its wing, There sure must be healing and rest in the tomb. XII. RETOUCH, SWEET FRIEND—RETOUCH THE LUTE. I Retouch, sweet Friend—retouch the Lute, Its tones may turn thy thoughts on me; Let not its chords be longer mute; Remember, 'twas my gift to thee! Wake then its wildest, sweetest strain, And bid the past be ours again! II Oh might it yield an answering sound To all my wishes, hopes, and fears; Nor e'er be mute or tuneless found Till I forget thy parting tears; Then would thy life, beloved, be One round of tenderest minstrelsy? XIII. THE PAINS OF MEMORY. I When Joy its fairest flowers hath shed, And even Hope's blossoms too are dead, Though Memory through the cloud of woé A momentary gleam may throw; II 'Tis but an ignis fatuus light,— A fleeting vision, frail as bright,— That mocks awhile the mourner's sight, To leave his soul in tenfold night! XIV. THE SOUL THAT WAS SHROUDED. I The soul that was shrouded in sorrow's dark night A peace-promising beam woke to gladness and light; And the lute, that so long lorn and tuneless had hung, Once more with the wild notes of melody rung! II Ah! why did that beam only shine to beguile? Ah! why did it teach the fond mourner to smile? Why faithlessly grant him a seeming reprieve, Then leave him in sadness still deeper to grieve? III The light is gone by—and the music is o'er, And the feelings so lovely—are lovely no more; That soul, once again, its dark vigils is keeping, And the Lute 'neath the cold chain of Silence is sleeping! XV. WHAT NEED OF YEARS—LONG YEARS TO PROVE? I What need of years, long years to prove The sense of Friendship or of Love? What need of years to firmly bind The social compact of the mind? II In youthful hearts of kindred mould, Not slowly feeling's flowers unfold; But oft—though 'neath a sky a gloom— They burst to instantaneous bloom! SONNETS. III. TO ?. Go, join the mincing measures of the crowd, And be that abject thing which men call wise, In the World's school of wisdom!—I despise Thy proffered aid!—Go! Thou may'st court the proud, With ready smile, and ever bended knee; But I do scorn to owe a debt to thee My soul could not repay.—There was a tie (Would it existed now!) which might have kept Peace, and good will between us:—I have wept, With tears of wild and breathless agony, That it should pass away;—and sought to quell The angry thoughts that in my breast would swell, When dwelling on my injuries:—but yet— Though I forgive,—I never can forget! IV. TO SENSIBILITY. Though for thy sake I am crost, Though my best hopes I have lost, And I knew thou'dst make my trouble Ten times more than ten times double, I should love and keep thee too, Spite of all the world could do. WITHER. I always loved thee, Sensibility! And though thou hast but served to work me woe, Do love thee still!—Nurtured beneath thine eye, ‘For me the meanest, simplest flowers that blow,’ Can raise up thoughts that lie too deep for tears. Not all the joys the multitude can know, Should e'er seduce my bosom to forego Thy sacred feelings!—Yet from earliest years, Like that frail plant whose shrinking leaves betray The careless pressure of an idle hand, My heart, unschooled in guile, could ne'er command Its hectics of the moment:—let thy ray, Then, thou sweet source of sorrow and delight, Beam on thy votary's soul with more attempered light. V. FROM THE PORTUGUESE OF CAMOENS. Vain was the frown of pride to disunite The hearts that love and sentiment had joined; Vainly it urged its stern, unyielding right To break the spell-wrought fetters of the mind:— They would not be undone, for thy soft soul Scorned to be subject to such base control. Oh! hadst thou been a dowerless village maid, And rich in nought beside thy native charms, I might have dared to woo thee to my arms, Thou not unwilling;—in some peaceful shade We might have lived in blissful solitude, Scorning, if scorned by Fortune:—Fate's decree Hath fixed it otherwise; dark cares intrude; But what are all my woes to that of losing thee! VI. WRITTEN IN A CHURCH-YARD. This is a spot to musing grief how dear! Where, unobserved, she may pour forth her plaint,— Ponder on pleasures past without restraint— And breathe the sigh—‘fools should not overhear.’ Much do I love, alone, to linger here, What time the glow of summer's evening beam Brightens the landscape round, and Mersey's stream Sleeps in the mellow light.—Sometimes a tear Of wild regret will steal into mine eye, As, musing 'mid these mansions of the dead, The sweet remembrances of years gone by— Of joys departed—hopes for ever fled— Come crowding on my mind; nor would I stem, For all the wealth of worlds, that woe's luxuriant gem! VIII. ON A DOMESTIC CALAMITY Now is all love shut from me;—I am left, Like the scathed pine upon the mountain's brow, Withered and branchless.—The last verdant bough That, 'mid the blight, put forth its freshening hues, Hath felt the lightning's wrath;—my all is reft, And I must wend me through life's vale of woe In solitude and tears:—well, be it so!— Yet these sweet thoughts shall soothe me, and diffuse A healing balm upon my suffering soul:— That I have been most happy, though so brief Were my young days of gladness—that my grief Was not of mine own planting, but the sole Endowment of misfortune;—and that bliss May bloom, from sorrow's seeds, in brighter realms than this. IX. TO SUSPENSE. Ill-boding Fiend! How oft thy fiery breath Hath stirred the storm of passion in my soul, Until the waves of thought spurned all control, And swelled to a fierce Phlegethon!—Beneath The wide expanse of yonder boundless sky, What hath the power to rack the feeling heart Like thy keen-torturing vengeance? Where the smart, Can match the brain-bewildering agony Thy presence doth create?—My lot, through life, Demon of dark uncertainty! hath been To have sweet feelings maddened into strife By thy bliss-blighting influence;—and each scene Of beauty, shadowed by thy wing accursed!— When shall I 'scape thy fangs? My heart—be still—or burst! MIRZALA. FROM THE ARABIC. Love! oh, young Love! Why hast thou not security? Thou art Like a bright river, on whose course the weeds Are thick and heavy; briars are on its banks, And jagged stones and rocks are 'mid its waves. Conscious of its own beauty, it will rush Over its many obstacles, and pant For some green valley as its quiet home. Alas! either it rushes with a desperate leap Over its barriers, foaming passionate, But prisoned still; or winding languidly, Becomes dark like Oblivion; or else wastes Itself away.—This is Love's history! L. E. L. I. She was beautiful as the lily-bosomed Houri She was beautiful as the lily-bosomed Houri that gladden the visions of the Poet, when, soothed to dreams of pleasantness and peace, the downy pinions of Sleep wave over his turbulent soul! II. She was more graceful than the Antelope; and her skin was fairer than the plumage of the billow-stemming bird of Franguestan. III. Her golden ringlets streamed over her snowy and transparent shoulders, like the rich rays of the noon-day sun upon a rock of the purest alabaster. IV. Her eyes were as two imaged stars peering from the blue depths of untroubled waters; and the vivid vermilion of her cheek was as the odour-breathing blossom of the peach. V. In sorrow,—ay, and even in joy,—the heaving of her bosom was like the tremulous motion of the Lake of Pearls, when the tempest that deformed it hath passed by. But for the heart that dwelt therein,— oh, its chords were ever musical, whether swept by the ruffian hand of Grief, or touched by the delicate fingers of Delight! VI. As the mysterious pebbles of Kathay yield their harmonious murmurs, whether wrought upon by the storm-blast or zephyr,—so the soul of Mirzala always responded in melody. VII. The Anemone is a lovely flower; but fragile and perishing as the forms that people the day-dreams of Fancy: the wind wringeth it from the stem, and quickly whirleth it on high. Even such was the daughter of Ben Azra, and so fared it with the maiden. VIII. There has been mourning in the Valley of Camels;—Desolation dwelleth in the Palace of the Emir; the lute and the ziraleet are silent in his halls; the dance and the revel have ceased;—the echoes of Israfil are no more; but hark to the wul-wulleh of Despair! IX. There is blood on the threshold of Ben Azra,—even the blood of the guiltless Abdallah;—for the Prophet hath not forbidden us to love,—and this was the sum of his offending. The ataghan was sheathed in his heart;—his turban-stone is whitening on the hill! X. O thou pervading Power of Love! Thou art to some, sweet as the bubbling fountain of freshness to the burning brow of the desert-worn traveller; but to others, terrible as the fiery pestilence, or the breath of the unmerciful Simoom!</field>
