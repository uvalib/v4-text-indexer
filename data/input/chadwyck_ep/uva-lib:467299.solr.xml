      <field name="fulltext">‘Faring Far forward as folk in a dream, That strive between doubting and daring Right on .....’ In the Salt Marshes (Swinburne). Harvest, A.D. 1914 (By the Wayside) I O'er harvest hills soft haze of shimmering heat Folds blue and dim; glows fiery sheen of wheat At core of amber sunbeams; kindled white The road creeps in beneath green shadow plight Of woven branches. Here two gossips greet: ‘Good morning ma'am; sure 'tis the grand hot day.’ ‘Aye, aye, too hot for our poor lads away Off yonder in the battles where they fight.’ ‘Ah, cold enough, God knows, before this night 'Tis many a one will sleep.’ Such talk have they Along the footpaths flecked with leaves and light. II The road glares like a white-hot ploughshare thrust Athwart the plain, whereon a rider lone Three times the blaze of noontide fierce hath known, Mocked with the parching air, the blinding dust, For all his daily fare; still, grown half-blind, Goes stumbling, starved, and goads his starving horse With ruthless steel, that rage may leave remorse The more to sadden his sick heart. Yet shined This summer day that ripes the red-gold corn In rustling fields, on none whose lot forlorn Draws nigh through heavier hours a desolate end; Since comes in foeman's guise his one grim friend, Nor holds his cruel doom a kinder fate Than if ere close the sunset's fire-silled gate, Some long-flamed shaft a curven blade should bend And thither so reach, that, reaped as harvest fruit, Be to the great Dark gathered man and brute. The Irish Archangel Called so in Ireland because Michael is such a common name there. (Michaelmas, 1915) Ah Michael, Michael, listen Angel asthore! [So in her heart Theresa Nolan said, Kneeling at Mass on the wide chapel-floor, Eyes lifted where, above her grey-shawled head, The great bright window stained the morning rays That pierced it, rose-red clear and amber turned. Across the hills she had fared by handsbreadth ways, Seaming long slopes, where fronded fire yet burned, And heather-bells had climbed up shoulder-high On writhen stems in smouldering wrecks of flame. With lonesome thoughts by lonesome paths she came, Since feet trod far that once had followed nigh.] Ah Michael, Michael, many's the time before I have seen you shining there athwart the light, With those grand wings on you, all glistering white Like sailing clouds, when in at yonder door From beneath the sun we'd step half blind—'twas ere The Big War took our lads—and then the sight Did my heart good, so strong you stand to scare The Devil's own self, and drive him down his lair. But now this trouble's on us, let him be: There's worse folk loose about the world than he. For doing harm belike was all his share Of ever doing aught; but Lords and Kings Might easy put a hand to better things Than raising up a war, that ere 'tis done Strikes thousands dead, and each a mother's son; That's bitter desolation bound to bring, With ruin and sorrow. Piled up heap on heap, Like fluttered leaves you see the cold blasts sweep Below the trees, the Dead are lying flung Where Mick is fighting now. Ah Michael, keep An eye on him, and sort him out among The rest, for many a Mick is soldiering there, And every one of them a decent lad, But Micky's all the sons that ever I had— You'd get none kinder if you searched Kildare. And he a gossoon yet; a while ago Scarce any size on him, the creature, or sense, Just playing around, or maybe coaxing pence For sweets—my grief that ever I said him no. So mind him, Michael, that's a Michael too, And make a shift to bring him safely through, And home to me before they've laid him low. Who stirred it up, God knows, had little to do: This Big War beats the wildest wind e'er blew For breaking hearts and driving people mad. Sure, after a storm you might be thinking bad To see the fine trees fallen there, overthrown, Not fret for them, nor feel the house so lone You doubt the sun has lost his way, he'll creep So low to set; and when at last 'tis night, Heart-scalded, scarce at all a body'll sleep, Or every minute's waking in a fright, And making sure I heard the rifle click That's cocked to kill him. Keep, and you'll do right, One flourish of your blazing sword to blind The ugly villain aiming at my Mick. And dreaming I do be of the guns they wind The bullets out of with a handle quick, To riddle hundreds while a clock would tick; And poison-clouds the poltroons send to choke Our lads' lives out, far off, with stifling smoke— 'Tis at the thought of them my heart grows sick. For if 'twas fighting fair with sword or lance, Or, say, shillélaghs, or a blackthorn stick, One with another gets an even chance; But where that hail of Hell is pelting thick, The best man counts for nought and strongest arm, Unless some queer good-luck he has indeed, Or a Great One like yourself 'twixt him and harm. But half afeard I am lest scarce more heed You give to us, and you in grandeur set, An Angel over Angels, than we take Of beasts that stray about the fields to feed As best they may out under dry and wet, And chance their shelter when the black storms break. Aye, Michael, I misdoubt yourself that see From high above thinks little of Mick and me As if some old grey hen that lost her chick Went clucking after it: Micky, Mick avic! Yet, Michael, listen now—I'm hoping still In all your glory you'll contrive a plan To help us on a sudden, ere they fill Wide earth with graves. For, Michael, if you've got The wings itself, at heart you're just a man: You won't delay till all the lads are shot. Troth, I'd ne'er grudge the worst you'd blast and ban Those miscreants-of-the-world that first began The killing; but save poor Mick, whate'er befall, And every Mick among them, if you can— Aye, bring the lads home, Michael, bring them all. The Unwelcome Guest (Holy Eve, 1915) Oft, since 'tis old she has grown, Whom the grudging days bereave, Year on long year and lone, Till her thoughts on their dim path tire, Turned back so far to grieve— Oft, when falls Holy Eve, Part hoping, part adread, She has heaped the sods of her fire, And here in its flickering glow Has the meal, remembering, spread For you, O her heart's desire, For you faring home from the Dead. Nay, but she knows not this night If the lad yet wake or sleep, Lost in the far-off fight, Where beyond the sound of our sea Fierce battle-thunders sweep Swift down a shoreless deep Full many a dear-rued head. Until dawn from fear set free, Her heart can find no rest, Still awaiting, sore bestead, That loved unwelcome guest: Lest loner than lone I be, Come not home to me with the Dead. A Knell and a Chime Methought a mournful bell, Fast by a shadowy sea, Tolled through its hush and swell: Qui bien aime tard oublie, Qui bien aime tard oublie. So lone the eve, nought stirred But seemed to speak a word, And ever thus said the knell: Qui bien aime tard oublie. O'er dusk waves, salt as tears Their spray, tossed wild as fears, Dimly it died. I trow Some lover long ago Had spoken it for a spell That should his heart set free From doubt's fell gramarie Time-wrought: who loveth well Doth tardily forget— Qui bien aime tard oublie, A vow, a promise, yet Vainly it died and died, Nor answering echoes met, Where all grief's bitter tide Beyond was waxen wide, Till silence, grown a threat, Would memory's doom foretell, Lingering friend-lorn and left At last to falter and flee The conqueror none may quell— By tyrannous change twice-reft, Qui bien aime tard oublie. Then as stark midnight fell, Turned from that desolate shore To listen there no more The bell make weary moan, Methought anon were strown, Dropped clear as dews of light, Notes thrilling, quivering far, That down the vaulted height Their crystal cadence flung, Faint from some outpost star, On fiery steeps aflame. In jubilant peals outrung The very voices came Waft of a happy clime, Where bells not toll but chime Blithe tidings. Qui bien aime, Tard, tard oublie, they run, Qui bien aime tard oublie Qui bien aime. Ah to have won Beside that shadowy sea, A haven-nook of sleep, And dream, and still dream deep That such a joy shall be! For Company ‘'Tis a word folk have,’ said she, ‘how there does be ever sore weeping For the light of heart who go from their life to their death with laughter.’ Lone stood the House, all hushed in stark silence from threshold to rafter; Only a bent little crone at the summons, mouse-paced, came creeping. ‘Laughing he was, Master Mac, with the lads that last minute, they say: Laughing he'd be, sure enough, with the Squire, they two, here in the hall. Yon's his cap I hung nigh the poor Master's, that's desolate left with it all, Just for company like,’ she said. But between, ah, the void Deep lay. Division Give Norah Shane, poor soul, who begs her bread, The penny that she asks, To bring down showers of blessing on your head A nimble tongue she tasks; ‘Long may ye live, and happy may ye die,’ Oft and again I have heard her prayer framed so: She called it after us when he and I Fared by a week ago ... Far lances flash, a bugle's shrill command, In saddle all his troop; To let him mount, his mare will hardly stand, Full gallop off they swoop; The fretting hooves throb free; he'd think so well Fay never went; they ne'er at fence did ride In such a glorious run. Down crashed the shell— No fear! he happy died. That both should see a whole good wish come true Was more than Fate could grant. If Norah's boon thus halved between us two, One share of joy be scant, Accept I yet the dole I would fain forego; Since fair his lot, mine own must needs forgive; Yea learn alone while days—while hours—creep slow, How years are long to live. A Late Post Clear looks the sad day's close, Ere eyes their watch forsake: With all the West one rose Long-rayed, so late it grows No letter shall she take. Clear looks the sad day's close In mockery, since she knows She must the hard vow make, With all the West one rose, That here her hope foregoes, Till ever the slow morn wake. Clear looks the sad day's close On night-dark ... Nay, who throws White through the slit this flake? With all the West one rose, Plain her boy's writing shows, Though caught in hands that shake— Clear looks the sad day's close, With all the West one rose A Hapchance Oracle Heart's rest it seems their kindly talk to leave, Who this for comfort hold, and fain would share: Not far off bide our Dead, they say, and cleave New access for despair. As if no dread vast deeps should hide the star Evanished from our void and darkling air, When, verily, except it shine afar, It shines not anywhere; Nor ever a ray thereof shall hope retrieve That fared not forth on paths of loneliest light ... Here soft falls silence down the hushed grey eve, The unfooted road curves white. Some lads pass, trampling up a dust-cloud dim, All brownly garbed as soil that labour delves: Deathward they march to humour a mad world's whim, And sing to please themselves. A witless song; yet haply, overheard, Fraught with the lore that Fortune sends us so: A long, long way to go; aye, take the word: A long, long way—to go. For Herself Alone (To Sinn Fein Ireland: Easter, 1916) Since first o'er crested foam our sun's fire flashed to thee, Never yet was come a call to such fortune fair and high; Through a storm of strife it cried that thy share of life and crown Thou should'st win thee, Ireland, with long, with loved renown, Fast leagued with all the Nations of the Free, Where to have fought is fame, and glory it is to die. Thy true sons, hearkening, left thee full many a hero's name. These all thou hast clean forgotten; by evil arts misled To thy bitter woe hast followed, strayed from ancient honour afar, Basest foes whose steps defile the blood-stained ways of war— My heart's grief, Ireland! this bides ever thy shame That thy faith thou hast broken, and hast betrayed thy Dead. It was not to be then, Ireland, soothly never to be. Thou hast slain the hope, and now as from a face grown still and white To look back again no more, so from thee we turn away, With a sad word only for last farewell to say: Sleep a long sleep, Ireland, lone in thy lone sea, Dream no dreams, Ireland, dark in thy dark night. The End ???????? ?????? ..... ?? ??? ?? ???????? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ????????? ????? ??? ???????? ?? ??, ?????? ??? ????????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? ?????. —Pindar, Pythian viii. Since yet a wilder storm its clamorous woe About all homes must wail, and field by field Grow full of graves, and Youth's blithe heyday yield, Quelled in the bitter death-hour, quenching so The hope of Age bereft; since halt must go More swift feet, more sun-loving eyes be sealed In livelong dark; since lust and ravin wield The brute's fell power o'er right and ruth laid low: Yea, since through clouds that weave a night in night One lonely camp-fire fades from hosts afar, Whither still in loss and scathe and ruin's despite Toil we as men whose quest is toward a star: Even for this cause, though Hell waste Earth, we fight To no war's end save endless end of War. A Dream by the Wild Water Still-looked, yon star o'er the wild water Through deeps of night, from a bourne unknown, Dim-flickering rays down the void vast hollow Sends thrilled afar where no thought dare follow, So dread the ways that aloof and lone Lead hither his light to the wild water. Yet dream there came to the wild water A word that said how, past sun on sun, Yon frail star-flame as a dew-fleck burning, Their eyes behold, who no more returning, Drear morn breaks cold on our world undone, All good days fled from the wild water: For you, thus grieved by the wild water, Soothsay of Spring on stark winter's air That word would bring, with strange joy betiding, Lost life retrieved, and old love abiding, And hope a-wing from spell-stopped despair Would soar and sing o'er the wild water. A Farmer's Fields On the hill-slope in the sun There his fields lie; every one Glows a jewel, where evening light Stays its flight from dusk begun. O'er them curved a crested height Rims the East whence dawns the night; High they climb this flitting day's Long clear rays to front aright. By her door she stands at gaze, Strange looks bent on olden ways; In a silence newly grown Waits alone while dark delays. All their chequered ploughed-and-sown, Spiny furze-bush, briery stone, Through their changing brown and green, Silken sheen, and blossom strown, Under shine and shadow seen, Joy to her and care have been; Now they seem a cloud-veiled shore With the roar of waves between. ‘Many a time he'd look them o'er, Late and early, from this door; Many a time, heart-vexed and crossed, See storm-tossed his little store. ‘Aye,’ she says, ‘to bitter cost Came against him blight and frost, Rain and drought, and all the rest; Try his best, 'twas labour lost. ‘Oft-times ruffled like the breast Of a kestrel-struck woodquest Lay his feathery oats, for so Wild 'twill blow from yonder West. ‘Or a sea-fog, drifted low, Left the 'taties row by row Blackened; for one creel he'd fill, Half a drill away he'd throw. ‘Sure hard task he had to till Just the bare side of the hill, Let alone with wind and wet On him set by the Lord's will. ‘Still, proud man he was, if yet God be praised, good luck he met: When his oats were fit to reap, Scarce he'd sleep till out he'd get.’ While she watches, o'er the steep Dim white mists float down and sweep; From each field that shimmering lies Brightness dies as on they creep. These may lift 'neath dawn-flushed skies: Mists that from the farmer's eyes Hid his bit of land, though morn Break forlorn, no more shall rise. A Lost Friend From westward tramped, about this countryside He had come long since, nor more of him was known. For miles around his basket's tinware shone, Blanching a sunbeam; lean and wistful-eyed He ever was of look; a wordless lay He crooned, as if went by a wild bee's drone: That low faint humming foretold his coming, And said he had left behind a lonesome way. Halting anon, he scarce made longer stay Than thistletufts that fitful breezes guide, Save only where the bridge with arch too wide O'ervaults the road-crossed river. If close of day Had brought him thither, oft on the wall's flagged ledge He would lean to watch the ripples as they hied, With murmuring soft, foam-frosted at the edge. Drought cast o'er all the land one summer-tide A dumbing spell: lake-water lapt the sedge Low sunk; no runlet 'neath the dusty hedge Sped, under greenery glancing half espied; Shrunken from crystal brim, the dripless well Mocked not in faery forge a tinkling sledge, Nor, knolled from elfin towers, a gleeful knell. Then on a morn his face paused by a door, There many a day unseen, and straightway told Of sorrow fallen anew on sorrow old, For, graven afresh, grief's charactery it bore. ‘Since last I came this road, my luck was bad,’ Quoth he: ‘Great lack falls oft on little store; So now I have lost the kindest friend I had. ‘Two hours the sun was down below yon ridge, And left the darkest sky of all this year, When yestereve I came to where I'd hear Herself discoursing underneath the bridge. She had many a pleasant voice, yet still the same; 'Twas lief I listened. Whiles when I was near Calling she seemed naught else but my own name. ‘Full sure I made I'd hear her voice aright, The sooner that I walked so late and lone. A kindly word she had for every stone: I must have heard her speaking through the night. I heard no sound. The world kept hushed as death. In troth I knew. Yet there for glimmer of light I waited sick at heart, and held my breath. ‘And what I had known, when dawn crept back again, My eyes beheld; for stirless as yon hill She lay, cleft through, where, thrust out grey and chill, A shingle-bar with sharp-edged blade had ta'en The life of her, struck silent so. Thinks I Mayhap she called me from those shadows still, And I far off, that now can ne'er come nigh. ‘But he who furthest fares belike more ill Meets not than he who bides while all things change; For both must see them yet grown drear and strange; Aye, both pass oft through open doorways, till They find a sudden wall built up instead.’ With that he turned his lonelier world to range, And now his path along crooned never an echoed song, Because the old kind voice he loved was dead. One for Sorrow (A Magpie Scarecrow) One for sorrow is hanged up on a pole To fright away keen beaks from young corn; The crows, his dusky kin, no funeral dole Made o'er his doom so forlorn; Yet hoarse and harsh their din Grates from yon mirk cloud wheeling Round leafy towers, concealing, Close-boughed, the careful broods within. One for sorrow sees not where blossom-drift Muffles the hedgerow thorn, Sheer foam and snow, till loftiest sprays uplift Be softlier swathed about than e'er with fleece, From flocks white-glimmering shorn, Was suppliant's wool-lapt wand, Borne forth at need to some God-friend in Greece; Hears not, fresh meads beyond, The voice a-wing, that lighting holds its peace, Cry still, dew-clear, and call, As from an elfin clime, With gleeful bells a-chime— One for sorrow is blind, is deaf to all. Two for mirth they sit perched up in a tree, Whose airy branches shade the fledged bole; Long quills droop satin-sleek, eyes glittering glee Gloat o'er the treasure they stole, Pink shred with tinsel streak; For wide earth, theirs to rifle Of many a precious trifle, Permits their peering hop oblique. Two for mirth, all in sable sapphire dight, Pearly of vest, a goal Of gladness in this low sun's westering light Have gained fast by their garnished robbers' nest, Their thievery dear and droll; And when they weary of ease, Out swoops their lucky flight on venturous quest. Ranging as fancies please Through fields afar, anigh with jocund zest, Beneath blue mid-May weather, From speedwell's gem sward-set To fir's tall minaret, Two for mirth taste the year's gay prime together. Sorrow for One Sorrow for one: nay, sorrow hath he none, His griefs all left behind This side the sun, Yet mirth for two makes evermore pursue The frown of Fate unkind, That one shall rue; If one be left to bear in mournful mind Lost noontide gleams, and how the world went well When gloaming fell; To ask, nor answer win, If, sorrow ended, haply joy begin, Threaded as day and night, Dark beads and bright, On strands the self-same life shall spin. Was never a spell that could response compel; No secret word from any ominous bird; Only for wistful vows most vainly stirred The woodland stillness with the cushat's croon; And ever the cuckoo's echoing crystal bell Rings on, a dwindled knell, That swims away to dreamful shores of sleep. Ah wake there, wake a soothfast oracle, Or silence keep. Two Pastorals I. A LAGGARD IN LOVE. High noon was aflame on the hills far and wide, When leaned on his crook stood a shepherd who sighed: ‘Now woe worth the day, see how Phyllida fares Up yonder green slope that no fierce sunbeam spares. ‘Ah! would that my shepherdess tended her sheep Low down in the vale under boughs close and deep; For fain would I walk where the cool shadow lies, Yet fain would I look into Phyllida's eyes.’ Thus plained the vexed shepherd, whom sorrow betid, For his flock roved afield while his fortune he chid; So needs must he follow, and at night's sill they strayed Where Phyllida laughed with his friend in the shade. II. OVER-HASTY. Low down in the vale he was leading his flock, Where sleepeth blue shadow beneath the cold rock, When off up the hill rang a call fluted high, Till echoes around him grew rife far and nigh: ‘Haste thee, shepherd, haste hither!’ He gazed up amain, up the slope smooth and steep, Nor marked on its green the white fleeces acreep, For there, beam in sunbeam, stood she who had cried, Young Sylvia the fair, and ere echo's note died His fain heart had leaped thither. Yet mute while he hung on those cadences clear, A voice fast beside him fell harsh on his ear; 'Twas Damon who answered, 'twas Damon she sought, So hope newly culled drooped and dwindled to nought, As a crushed weed might wither. A Want-Wit The long, strait pastures threaded on the stream All night beneath soft rain-showers lay a-dream, But waked when rose-red clearness still increased Beyond one low grey cloud that rimmed the East In stone-wall country-wise. For then the sun Smote gems' fire from the blade-drops all and one, Yet wrought them cells unseen in crystal air Ray-warmed, till soon they had vanished everywhere. Only the tangled grass along the hedges Trailed coldly drenched; the ripple side of the sedges Scarce wetter footing yielded; none the less, Even there, in shelter of some bush-screened recess, The briars and little thorn-leaves curtained round Had let no drop prick through. The brown bare ground In one of these close nooks by ruins showed That there o'ernight a ruddy flame had glowed; For ashes white on crookt twigs black and charred Flaked thick, as if, indeed, the feathers barred Silver and sable, wear of furtive pye, Lay plucked and strewn. And on the bank anigh Sat blinking at the sun, his dark head flecked With rime frost, he who had reared that fire now wrecked. 'Twas Joe the Fool, met oft on many a road; Beside him shone his nowise heavy load, Tin cans a few, and mugs, and platters small, Whence flashed, the sunbeams blanched and dazzling all, Came bickered. But Joe's eyes a wilder light Held constantly than flits at fall of night On glancing wings about the skies' far height, Ne'er caught and caged to make a sheen discreet In silent chamber or in bustling street. And here they look half puzzled, scarce awake, From paths of slumber jostled by a shake Suddenly; and gruff the voice that hailed him back To tread this earth. ‘Come now, my man, just pack. You're trespassing on private lands; no place For you at all.’ Whereon with sauntering pace, Along the hedge had passed, in cap and cape, 'Twixt shadow and shine the sombre portly shape. But Joe the Fool a while yet round him gazed In meditation haply that appraised The interwoven green and airy rift Of azure, glistening with the snow-cloud's drift, The patient droop of seed-plumed grass, the cry From bird to bird, and stream's song crooning by. Said then to himself: ‘The sorrow a bit I see What ails this place; 'tis well enough for me. Queer talk the pólis do be having. Sure You'd think there was no place but owned a door, And they the key. Howe'er, I'm stepping on, And apt to find as good before I'm gone A great way further.’ So, with hand deep-curved To shield the tiny flame that swayed and swerved In breeze's breath, his morning pipe he lit. ‘My notion is, poor man, he wants the wit, And arguing with a one that's short of it Is labour lost. You might as soon,’ he said, ‘Make shift to strike a match without a head.’ A Conjectural Emendation (Antigone 4) The old grey house this many a year stands lone, With grass-lands wide begirt; and grey and old This many a lonely year its master, grown A bookworm haunting places blurred with mould, In the long narrow brown-walled library reads, Or oftener, haply, if the truth were told, But wanders through a dream as memory leads His steps forlorn; still, whithersoe'er it guide him, Yon portly tome, green-clad like faded meads, Lies open beside him. Much learning gathered up the spread leaf shows: One verse of Sophocles, a dubious text, Whereon a stream of comment overflows, Sprung variously, from this page to the next. No scholar through that clouded script sees clear How sad Antigone her fate sore vexed Arraigned, and they to whom the words appear That lift the haze do soothly but increase it. Amongst them Thomas Dale ???? ??? ?? Inepte conjecit. His heavy pencil's point has underlined With scoring blue and broad the censured name, But Thomas Dale has never a whit repined, Nay, rather prizes the recorded blame; For so he trusts by power of printing press He shall not pass away unknown to fame. Deem you that note his essay's ill success In pillory sets, whence fain he would release it? A shrewder critic marks against your guess: Inepte conjecit. Regeneration Up at the Big House, at the Sale last week, The books fetched next to nothing; by the stone They mostly went; you had them, so to speak For just the carrying off. Well, if I'd known, I might have brought the ass, and taken a load In sacks, but missed the chance; small loss I thought it, Considering time extremely ill bestowed In reading stupid stuff because you've bought it. The rest was offered by the hundredweight, Which means waste-paper and the pulping mill; A worthless lot; you'd count, at any rate, Their like good riddance from the room they fill: Old sermons, tracts, long Lives of God knows who, Epitomes, learned manuals out of date. The brown blurred print would strain your eyes, and you Be none the wiser—'twas their righteous fate. Yet, when from factory-turmoil into calms Emerged, what capable and fleckless sheets, Clear of McKenzie on the Cursing Psalms, May bear, as leaves flash dew, some Ode of Keats. Song of a Sprite Set Free The wind hath a way That he needs must keep, He dare not wander Though the stars beck: ‘Stray Yonder and yonder Where far skies bend deep O'er a stranger day Than the dreams of sleep’— He may storm on his way, But he shall not wander. The wave hath a way For his reared up foam, Come seething, slidden; With his crested spray Faring forbidden From one path to roam Must its bounds obey, Yet his heart's wild home Fain would seek by a way To his surge forbidden. My wings find no way In the width of the world Can bar the brightening Of their fire-fledged ray; Laggard is lightning To their flight unfurled In my fancy's sway Wheresoe'er 'tis whirled, As they flash on their way, And leave laggard lightning. The Culprit Went up a clamour, a cry, begun 'Neath shrouding wings of night, For deeds that could make dark a sun, If dared in heaven's good light; With woe and bitterest wrath it won, Wailing, the welkin's height. Impierceable the shadow lay As veil of hidden doom Whereby fate lists our steps betray Unaware; from out that gloom Only lamenting rose alway To fill the world's wide room. Then lo, as if the brooding dark confesst Its secret dire, Strode forth one armed from heel to lofty crest With mail like fire Smouldering on embers dulled, yet ever addresst To blaze in ire. But, drawn in his Titan's grasp, the brand he bore Seemed very flame; A mighty blade, entituled as of yore Be they whose fame Bides chronicled; yea have men cursed it sore By many a name. Its wielder's hand no thralling ruth Withheld, whose glaive had slain A myriadfold earth's flower of youth, And still for deeper stain Glowed greedily. That it now in sooth Should keenlier bite again With finer edge unflawed, if any place Fierce strokes impaired, Flashed to and fro thwart a grim crag's smooth face Like levin it flared. (Fraught with wild griefs from yonder stricken race, Loud winds despaired). He wrought till it burned from point to hilt As first new-forged, ere fell On lives innumerably spilt Its bale-fire's blinding spell; While even as lads light-hearted lilt O'er tasks that like them well, Now hum a stave, now haply troll thereof Some clearer word, So rose this slayer's careless song above His whetted sword; And ever said thus the burden: life is love And love is Lord.</field>
