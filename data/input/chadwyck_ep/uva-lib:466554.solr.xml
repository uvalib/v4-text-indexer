      <field name="fulltext">“Non enim quæro intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam.” —St. Anselm. “Thy way, O God, is in the Sanctuary.” Psalm lxxvii. 13. To The Memory of GEORGE HERBERT, Author of “The Temple,” THIS ATTEMPT TO ILLUSTRATE BY MEDITATIONS IN VERSE THE SPIRIT OF THE ENGLISH LITURGY, REGARDED AS A CATHOLIC WHOLE, IS GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED, BY THE AUTHOR. London, April 7th, 1855. Prefatory Words. “Mine House shall be called an House of Prayer.” I love my Prayer-book, it breathes Of heaven and holiness to me, And round awaken'd conscience wreathes The echoes of eternity. 'Tis ancient, catholic, and true, And gifted with a power sublime That brings the spirit-world to view By drawing back the veils of time. Three bulwarks round the church are thrown By Word, or Sacrament, or Grace, And in our Liturgy we own That each retains a glorious place. Its hoary archives, too, unfold How providence, by secret plan, Hath counterwork'd the bad and bold Who hate The Christ which humbles man. From birth to death it peals a voice Of warning truth or wisest love, And consecrates that better choice Whose treasures are enshrined above. Dejection's sigh, devotion's tear, The laud, the rapture, and the groan Attending angels pause to hear When guilt enclasps the mercy-throne,— In this pure book of prayer may find Some answ'ring note of guidance true, Till Faith illumes the darken'd mind By teaching more than prophets knew. God of our Fathers! thus we lift Hosannahs unto Thee and Thine, And rally round that peerless gift We dare not, unto death, resign. Rather than sink religion down In homage to some human creed, Be this the churchman's hallow'd crown, To follow where its doctrines lead,— Which are the voices true and deep Of God Himself in scripture heard When o'er some echoing bosom sweep The life-tones of that saving Word: And, next to this, a Book we love Whose living page of light unfolds Truths which confess the Lord above, Whom earth believes, and heaven beholds. The Sanctuary. Morning Prayer. “In the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will look up.” —Ps. v. 3. The sacred hush of early morn In hues of golden radiance born, Seems like a silent worship given By grateful earth to glorious heaven: The elements, in placid rest, Keep sabbath o'er creation's breast, While conscious Nature half adores The Lord to Whom devotion soars. Round the lull'd ocean, sky, and air, A dream-like trance broods everywhere, And yet, of Him, to sense and soul How eloquent the voiceless whole! Now blooms the childhood of the day, When light and loveliness array The dew-eyed glance of each young flower That opes its lid in garden-bower. Glowing with omnipresent God, And bright as if by Angels trod, The vernal landscape, fruit, and field, To Heaven their mute hosannah yield. Fruitful trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. ? praise the name of the Lord. Ps. cxlviii. 9, 13. But, wing'd by faith, let souls ascend And with celestial Harpers blend Their litanies, whose tone divine Echoes the creed,—The Lord is mine! Cant. ii. 16. Abroad, at home, on land, or sea, Lift we, O God! our lives to Thee; And in calm thoughts of Thy blest care Find dawning heaven in daily prayer. Unconscious, through our helpless sleep, Thine Eyes their watches o'er us keep, While Mercy comes at matin hour To give each pulse its waking power. Soul of our Souls! Incarnate grace! Ere Day begin its destined race, Celestial guidance, awe, and love Breathe from Thy mercy-shrine above. By Heaven unwatch'd, we cannot stand, Since perils lurk on every hand; Nor can we wind a human path Whose bloom no hidden serpent hath. Be Thou, dear Lord, our Sun and Shield, To faith's adoring heart reveal'd; In all we suffer, dream, or do, For Christ and glory keep us true. Morn, noon, and night, beneath Thy wing A blessing, not a burden, bring, If will and word to Thee incline And welcome law as love Divine. Rom. xiii. 8. Thus may we learn, ere time depart, How Heaven is imaged on the heart; While life repeats what lips declare,— Obedience proves embodied prayer. Lost in ourselves, in Christ re-found, Thus move we through each duteous round, And toil and task will channels be, Like Sacraments, conveying Thee. They live the best, who love the most, And count that day a sinful boast In which no care, or cross hath shown God rules the will, and reigns alone. Evening Prayer. “Let my prayer be ? as the Evening Sacrifice.” —Ps. cxli. 2. Almighty Priest! in prayer to Thee Are secrets Angels yearn to see; 1 Pet. i. 12. And duties are delights to all Who Christ in heaven their glory call. And thus, when toil-worn day is done And meditative eve begun, Devotion feels a mystic spell To consecrate the sun's farewell. Religion in that radiance glows,— A deeper charm than light bestows Of mournfulness, whose mild appeals The heart approves, and conscience feels. Nature is one mysterious plan That moves in sympathy with Man; Rom. viii. 22. Her scenes are parables to thought, With types of teaching wisdom fraught. Round hill and valley, sea and shore, The leafy wood and forest hoar, Cathedrals, cots, and village-plains, A lulling sense of beauty reigns. Thy truth, oh Lord! in each we trace, As inward law of outward grace, And think, how bright this world can be When all its glories mirror Thee! Creation seems at vespers, now: And saints, who in Thy worship bow, While dying beams array the west Commune with Nature's holy rest. But, prayer and penitence are due For all the sins our soul must rue, And boundless guilt, Thy Blood alone Can Rev. vii. 14. whiten at the Judgment-throne! A prayerless mood, at such an hour, What is it, but a Belial-power,— A blinding haze of self and sin Which hides the demon-heart within? Then, dear the chime of evening-bells! Whose music like emotion swells; And blest the pathways, meekly trod, Whose windings seek the House of God. All treasures in that Church abound Where Matt. xviii. 20. Christ is heard, and pardon found: And Souls, who would their Master see, Await Him where He loves to be. Ps. lxxxvii. 2. There may we nurse Devotion's awe; His Word receive as light, and law; And near, and nearer round the Throne Encircle HIM Faith calls her own. From thence return'd, in peace and prayer, God of the hearth-side! meet us there; And give to Thy belovèd sleep, Ps. cxxvii. 2. Whose hearts full often wake, and weep! Be each fond babe on mother's breast In pillow'd beauty rock'd to rest; And show the orphan's inward eye Parental Forms beyond the sky. O Thou! Who art the Slumberless, Ps. cxxi. 40. Protect our sleeping helplessness; And be to saints that Spirit given Who breathes on earth the balm of heaven. The Order for Morning and Evening Prayer. “The Morning and Evening Prayer shall be used in the accustomed place of the Church, Chapel, or Chancel.” —Prayer Book. Bright-wing'd Adorers! who enwreath God's throne In worship, awe, and wonder, Waft from your choral heaven some kindling tone To Saints assembled under That Mercy-seat of Light above Which ye behold in perfect love; That from your liturgy our own may take Echoes which keep regen'rate hearts awake. Sinless ye are, but sinful clay are we, Lisping our feeble praise; Time is our home, but yours,—eternity Amid th' empyreal blaze Where Father, Son, and Spirit dwell In glories unrevealable! Yet, from the Ephes. iii. 10. Church angelic nature can Learn mystic lore, by seeing God in Man. Still, in these outer-courts of Flesh and Time Wall'd round by space, and earth, Souls know but little of that chant sublime Which suits their second birth; While ye, whose cloudless vision eyes HIM who became their Sacrifice, Not through our media, distant, faint, or dim, Laud the One Lord of Saints, and Seraphim. But now, preluded by that gracious word Ezek. xviii. 27. From lips of Mercy spoken, Our heart-toned litanies on high are heard Most welcome, when most broken By sobs and sighs, that intervene, Confessing what the past hath been:— And this, because a Heb. vii. 17. priested God-Man there Divinely consecrates the Church's prayer. Approach we, therefore; but, with rev'rence due, O'erawed by instincts deep; And, on the brink of vocal worship, view Visions which make us weep,— Arising from remember'd years, From harrow'd guilt, and haunting fears, While pale contritions shudder from within O'er the dread shadow of departed sin! Maternal Guide! fond Mother of us all, Blest be thy wisdom now; Who, ere on Christ our adorations call, The speechless heart would bow, And by reflecting silence teach Lessons mere language cannot reach; While musing Sorrow introverts the eye, And God, in gentleness, Psalm xviii, 27. seems passing by. The Sentences. “Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.” —Ps. li. 7. In myst'ry o'er the myriad-chorded soul The sightless grace of Godhead moves; And, touching it with undivined control, Evokes what tone His Will approves:— Hence, hope and faith, and fear, with joy and grief, by turns Responsively awake, as Man salvation learns. And thus, by secret wisdom taught of heaven, The Church, in her sublime appeals, Hath to each mind and mood appliance given, Which probes the heart, or conscience heals:— In spirit corp'rate, yet, our deep-toned Prayer-book can Echo the varied needs of individual Man. And, ere the vocal liturgy begin, A litany of silence now Let Worship offer; and by faith within Hear holy Sentences avow Truths of selected tone, whose pure adjustment may Meet all those mingled wants, with which men come to pray. Solemn and silent, take we then our stand; And as some vernal bower receives A dew-born freshness, or the sunshine bland Which decks the dawning grace of leaves,— So let our waiting hearts adoring welcome give To those great fontal Truths, from whence we learn, and live. Darkness and doubt, formality and dread, And with'ring apathy abound Oft in frail souls, by some devotion led Heaven's face to seek, on holy ground; But, such in these high words may healing radiance find Those sinful clouds to break, which overcast the mind. God of our Fathers! on Thy grace we call, Whose nature and whose name are one, And that is,—Love! with light John i. 9. embracing all Of mortal race beneath the sun:— Bid Life a living prayer of preparation be For that transcendant hour, when heaven unveileth Thee! The Exhortation. “I pray and beseech you, ? to accompany me with a pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace.” —Prayer Book. Creation is a speech divine, A vast Apocalypse of power, A Sermon preach'd, O God! on Thee, and Thine In Earth's cathedral, ev'ry hour. Magnificent, though mute to sense, Such homilies from Land, and Sea; Yet, all are lectures from Omnipotence Whose texts are truths on Deity. And Providence Thy preacher is, Whose pulpit fills all space and time; And, eloquent of varied woe, or bliss, Harangues us with a tone sublime! Around, within, beneath, above, Nature's dim Bible ev'rywhere Authenticates a dawning creed of Love, Learnt by some lisping babe in prayer. But, harshly-cold, our riper years Are seldom touch'd by such appeals; And hearts, when sin hath shut the inward ears, Seem deaf to what pure childhood feels. And hence, the Exhortation rolls With rhetoric divine, or deep, A thrilling summons o'er baptisèd souls Who yet in sin-made darkness sleep! And be confession our reply, Oh, Saviour-God!—for such is due; Pierced by love-pangs, and with imploring eye Look we to heaven, and inly rue! The past and present none can hide, Nor cloak the shrinking heart from Thee:— Clear as the mote within some beam descried, All souls are scann'd by Deity! General Confession. “We have erred and strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep.” —Prayer Book. When some bow'd sinner, on his bended knees, A guardian-Angel in confession sees, He shades him with celestial wing; And as that contrite pleader yearns, and cries That Blood Divine may cleanse him for the skies,— Watches the Soul thus worshipping. But, if one heart can thus intensely move Those wing'd Adorers, who but live to love, And brighten o'er repenting Man, Luke xv. 10. How are they thrill'd, when thronging myriads meet In temple-courts, to clasp the Mercy-Seat And cry, as Earth's redeemed can, “Father of Souls! absolve Thine erring child, To Self devoted, and by Sin defiled, Who far has stray'd from Thee, and Heaven; To the green pastures of Thy Word, and Will, Sheep of Thy flock and fold, oh! lead us still,— Fearful, but yet by grace forgiven. Read in the light of Thine all-searching Law, What countless stains pure conscience never saw These roving hearts of shame present! Omission and commission, both are ours, And oft have sacrificed anointed Powers 1 Cor. vi. 20. And robb'd the Lord Omnipotent. Healthless and hopeless, thus on Thee we call, Equal in guilt, for equal mercy all, Great Shepherd of Thy chosen sheep! Thine is the merit, mis'ry ours, alone; Till balm and blessing from Thy gracious Throne Comfort the wounded Hearts that weep. The Absolution. “God ? hath given power and commandment to his Ministers to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins.” —Prayer Book. No peace exists, except where pardon reigns, And such, mere reason never saw; Since all which legal Conscience gets, or gains By questions put to perfect Law, Is but the thunder and the threat,— “Perish! or pay thy boundless debt!” The sternness and the symmetry of Truth Enthroned above compliant will, Can neither bend to Age, nor bow to Youth, But act their awful nature still; For, God unglorified must be If Truth has no eternity! That poem vast, that Parable divine, Creation, with its gloom and glory, Who can translate each sacramental line Which shadows our redemption-story,— Unless Faith's inward eye be given To read on earth the scroll of heaven? And, is not Providence a searchless maze, Wherein all moral seekers find Contrasted problems, which confound their gaze Whose Scripture is the creedless mind, When Cain-like Gen. iv. 3. wisdom madly dares To mock the sacrifice of prayers? Can God forgive? And are we pardon'd men? Behold! the question, deep and stern; And, if absolved, by whom, and where, and when?— Lord! in Thy Church and Creed we learn Free pardon from atonement springs, Which Calv'ry to contrition brings. Amen. “The people shall answer here, and at the end of all other Prayers—‘Amen.’” —Prayer Book. Lift we now the loud See Jerome in 2 Prœm. Com. in Gal. “Amen” In the Temple, where and when The living Name of Christ is lauded; But except a speaking heart Echo what our lips impart, Our worship is of soul defrauded. In that word a world of truth Is enshrined for Age and Youth, Far deeper than all thought discerneth;— By it broad assent is given To that Creed, in hell or heaven, Sinner, or saint, for ever learneth! 'Tis indeed a boundless thought With unfathom'd myst'ry fraught,— Eternity is thus affected By a tone that never dies, But which soars beyond the skies Howe'er by impious mock rejected! Yet, if Life the lips repeat When baptised Adorers meet, And with their speech and soul assenting Thrill some Angel on his throne, When he hears the heaven-raised tone From raptured hosts, or hearts repenting,— Let no dread their worship chill! God and Grace are present still, And unto love will ne'er be wanting: If our Will endure the Cross Deeming sin our only loss, The “Amen” loud let souls be chanting. Deepen thus, the dreadless sound, 'Till the vaulted aisles rebound, Nave, roof, and arch, with “Amens” thrilling,— When the Easter of our soul Bids the paschal thunder roll, Angelic hearts with echoes filling. Yet, once more, and still again Lift on high the full-voiced strain!— God's ancient Martyrs thus reviving When their anthem'd worship soar'd Unto Him their lives adored, Clem. Strom. l. 1, c. 7.Till earth with heaven in praise seem'd striving. All the Church's book presents, Creed, or Prayer, or Sacraments,— What are they, but a Voice supernal From those changeless Truths divine Veil'd within the awful Shrine Of Christ, Who is their Source eternal? Hast thou heard the wave-tongued Sea Hymning praise to Deity With choral billows, vast and heaving? Or, rude surges in their roar When they beat the throbbing shore, Both far and wide a foam-trace leaving Or, in some poetic mood Listen'd to a leafy wood Roused by the whirl-blast, wild and rushing Or, alone in vernal bower Lull'd by its elysian power, Been lapp'd in dreams, by fountain gushing?— Not in each, or all is found Such religion in their sound, As Temples hear from lips repeating In liturgic swells of song “Amen,” as it swells along,— Timed by the heart's profoundest beating. Ask not, if the aisles august Where dead Immortals in mute dust Under sepulchral pomp are lying— Echoed are by such deep word? Or, in village-fane be heard A peasant-choir to Priest replying: Let but heart-toned prayer reveal What adoring bosoms feel, And Saints with Seraphim are blending,— “Amen” when Devotion cries Till the angel-crowded skies Reverberate that voice ascending! The Lord's Prayer. “The Minister shall kneel and say the Lord's Prayer with an audible voice; the people also kneeling, and repeating it with him.” —Rubric. As roll the rivers to the sea, So, human prayers subside in Thee, Devotion's archetype for all Who God in Christ their “Father” call! And, e'en as Worlds a radiance draw From one great Orb, which is their law, So, in this model-prayer can Mind A fountain-source of worship find,— A light suggestive, which may give An inward heaven Alluding to the Third Petition in Lord's Prayer. to all who live. Ideal Type of truth and love! Thy words are wings to waft above The soaring Hearts, which nobly thrill To crucify the flesh-born Will, And would like sinless Angels be Whose lauds resound eternally, And yet, when most their glories shine They view them in the Will Divine, By doing which their own is done,— Like portions of the Primal One. Creation's Lord! from Thee it came; And, offer'd in Thy pleading Name, What is it, but the Filial Word Before the Father-God preferr'd?— A myst'ry of sublime appeal More fathomless than man can feel, Since, like Thy Person, in Thy Prayer Both God and Man their truth declare; And ev'ry tone therein that dwells Some grace of Incarnation tells. Here, each for all, and all for each By perfect words their God can reach; For He, who knew the Church's life Of sin and woe, of fear and strife, Hath here epitomised for man The vastness of that saving Plan, By which the children of His grace On earth may see Jehovah's Face; 2 Chron. vii. 14. And, by such blest compendium prove The token-smiles of tend'rest love! Boundless, though brief, while calm, sublime: Condition, space, and scene and time,— All which Convention's law can bind Around the heart, or on the mind, Dies and dissolves in this blest Prayer! Whose words are echoes ev'rywhere Of want and weakness, faith and fears Breath'd into sighs, or spoke by tears,— Of all men need, or God can give To souls who on His promise live. The Responses. “O Lord, open Thou our lips, And our mouth shall shew forth Thy praise.” —Prayer Book. God of the Soul! Whose grace alone Can make it Thine internal throne, Wing'd on Emanuel's Matt. vii. 7. words, our hearts would now ascend, And, ent'ring in behind The Veil, Although by nature blind and frail, With sinless Harpers there our lauding hymns would blend. And hence, with antiphonal glow, Back to the Priest from People flow Pure versicles, which tone the worship of the mind; That quicken'd thus the Church may be By pleading Truth's variety, And with harmonious love seek God in heaven enshrined. But, Sin and Satan, guilt and gloom In silence might our praise entomb, Unless the Seraph come, and with his living coal John vi. 6. The terror of our lips unseal, And open them with burning zeal, And bid our ransom'd speech in praises round Thee roll! For, language is a gift divine; And pardon'd men can most feel Thine When Liturgies uplift, in Temples rear'd to Thee, Adoring faculties which prove The vastness of Incarnate Love, To us in time reveal'd, but reaching through eternity! Speed, Lord! and help the hearts which cry, When sins, like slain Egyptians, lie, Crush'd by subduing power of Thy victorious grace; E'en as of old freed Israel's host Soon as the Red Sea waves were crost, Peal'd hallelujahs loud o'er Pharaoh's buried race! Exod. xv. 15. Fiends lurk behind, and foes before; But Thine elect can more and more High o'er this earth-bound scene an Ark of Refuge hail; And while they chant their blended hymn Can paraphrase the Seraphim,— “Worthy the Lamb in Light! The Prince Who must prevail!” Doxology. “Glory be to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.” —Prayer Book. “Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”— Ocean of truth! In Thy deep waves are lost All souls which dare rebellious be; Or, anchor'd not on Deity, Would seek on thrones of earth-born will to reign, And finite heaven by godless freedom gain. Glory to One in Three, and Three in One! Boundless Triune of BEING unbegun! Creation, providence, and grace Here find a sacramental place,— Which is, to shadow forth The Name Divine, Token and type of all in Thee, and Thine. Hosannah! round the Universe there rolls In three-toned echo for those heaven-taught souls, Who from that eucharistic hymn Is. vi. 3. Chanted by Glory's cherubim, Catch wafted meanings, whose melodious sway Soothes the harsh discord of life's perill'd day. Ancient of Hymns! Creation's virgin prime Heard from a starry choir Job xxxviii. 7. thy burst sublime, Pealing on high, like paschal mirth Rejoicing o'er the new-born Earth: Such was it, is, and ever shall remain,— The ceaseless worship of that choral strain! All holy Consciousness of light, and love, The Saints below, the Seraphim above,— Co-equal in high majesty, Eternal in full harmony, A Three in One through heaven and earth proclaim, And find the Truth and Trinity the same. Creed, Chant, Confession,—do not all and each Blend in those words, and God to Manhood teach, Which speak of Father, Son, and Spirit Whom in the Church our souls inherit, When, christen'd by His Trinitarian Matt. xxviii. 19. grace God calls His children an adopted race? Thus, hymn we Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Whose mercy gives far more than Adam lost, And now, with echoing hearts adore Those we shall laud for evermore:— Time limits prayer, but praise eternal is, The life of Glory, and the law of Bliss. Venite. “Venite, exultemus Domino.” —Ps. xcv. 6. Harp of the spirit! with exulting swell Yield thy deep chords to ecstacy divine; And, thrill'd with awe, yon throned Emanuel tell, “Come we, O Lord! to worship Thee, and Thine!” E'en as the shout which banner'd armies raise When front to front their steel'd battalions meet, Bids from each eye-beam flash a prouder blaze And the roused heart with pulse heroic beat, So let Thy soldiers, Lord! who now begin A spirit-fight “Manfully fight under His banner,” &amp;c. —Sec Baptismal Service. with Fiends, or foes, on earth, Wake ev'ry faculty of grace within By one rich war-cry of victorious mirth. “Venite!” chant we; 'tis the Church's own, A living summons, which on David's lyre Quiver'd of old with supernat'ral tone, And still breathes all celestial hopes inspire. Prayer, praise, and preaching,—such the triple-charm A saving Wisdom secretly applies To all who, with devotion wing'd and warm, Soar out of self, and seek their natal skies. Great is our God! no miracle of thought, Or thinking vastness of seraphic mind Hath ever into perfect vision brought His nameless glories, which are undivined. Mind cannot span the measure of a Power High o'er the highest world that rules, and reigns; The pillars of the Earth upholds He ev'ry hour, And in His hand Is. xi. 12. the Universe contains! Daily Psalms. “Then shall follow the Psalms in order as they are appointed.” —Rubric. When o'er God's awful Book I bend Perusing it in peace and prayer, Blest PARACLETE! Thine unction send That faith may find my Saviour there; And feel the love and light of sacred Story Are but the token-gleams of His incarnate glory. But, though each page prove all-divine, Profound as Truth's eternity, And hence, as from a mental Shrine Flow oracles which make us free,— John viii. 32. If one pure leaf may wield a master-spell, Oh! is it not where most Emanuel's eye-beam fell? The golden eloquence of heaven Falters before a theme, like this!— That to the Saviour's heart were given A healing balm and holy bliss, Counsels of love, and consolations deep When homeless here on earth, our burdens made Him weep! Not from Himself as God derived, But, forth from David's harp Matt. iv. 7. He drew, When Satan with His Manhood strived,— Tones which declare how well He knew That Laureate of the Holy Ghost, whose lyre Anthems by God attuned enrapture and inspire. At His last feast of paschal love Our Lord a Jewish hallel sung; And when He awed the heavens above While on th' almighty Cross He hung, From Zion's bard he took that awful speech Matt. xxvii. 40. Whose agonising depth no line of Thought can reach! Nor paused He here: that parting breath Which breath'd on earth the grand farewell When God-Man died th' atoning death Which rescued Earth from hate and hell,— Faith listens, while it heaves a hallow'd sigh Breath'd out of David's soul, Luke xxiii. 46. when Death seem'd drawing nigh. Priceless and peerless hold we, then, That page Messiah loved to read; For, long as earth has suff'ring men The Psalms reply to human need; And by sweet touches of melodious grace Thrill every spirit-chord which vibrates through our race! All passions, principles, and powers, Motions and meanings of delight, Which rule us in religious hours At hymning morn, or holy night, On land, or sea, when social, or alone,— These Lyrics of the Lord for each adjust a tone. A mystic paradise of truth Martyrs and Saints of olden time Saw in each page for age, or youth, And caroll'd it with love sublime; Nor can the tongues of man, or angel, count The comforts which have flow'd from this celestial fount. No sigh the laden heart hath heaved, No tear a drooping eyelid shed, No fearful pang our bosom grieved When Life has ponder'd o'er the Dead,— But in Christ's Manual can devotion find Some echo of relief to suit the aching mind. Kings, Priests, and Prophets, all may there The perfect heart of Jesu prove, And hear it God to man declare With beating pulse of boundless love!— Such are the Psalms; where all which Lyre can be, Is married into Grace for immortality. Poet of Heaven! High-Priest of song! Type of the Lord, in truth and grace, Oh! that to Saints might now belong The faith and fervour of thy race; Then would their lives be living psalms of love, And choral Earth repeat the chanting Heavens above. The Lessons. “Then shall be read distinctly with an audible voice the First Lesson.” —Prayer Book. How should we read His hallow'd Word And be by God in language stirr'd Up to rapt heights of holiness, and love?— Oh, not by culture, proud and cold, Nor by mere reason, men behold Secrets where God unveils His heart above. What, though no starry Miracle Darts through the air a dazzling spell, Nor thunders fill the throbbing earth with fear; Nor wing'd Ambassadors alight Fresh from their thrones, all glory-bright, Till Falsehood trembles, as the Truth draws near? Though seal'd Dan. xii. 9. the Vision, and are dumb Voices Divine, that used to come, And through each hidden chamber of the heart Awaken echoes, dread and deep, Which woke it from its iron sleep,— Dream not, from earth that God and Grace depart! Poor martyr of the senses five By faith against thy flesh-creed strive! And meekly bend o'er yonder ancient Book: An infant-grasp contains the whole, And yet, thine everlasting Soul Shall ne'er beyond its vast horizon look! Once, undivulged and unreveal'd Its mental essence lay conceal'd In the hush'd deeps of God's unecho'd Mind; But now, for Earth's elected race In grand epiphany of grace It shines in Scripture o'er redeem'd mankind. In language garb'd, the Holy Ghost Arrays Himself, to teach the lost, And thus, approaches whomsoe'er He will; But if thy soul be clogg'd with sin, And treason nurse untruth within,— What art thou, but the deafen'd adder, Ps. lviii. 4. still? Te Deum. “We praise Thee, O God; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord.” —Ambrose. O Lord, how luminous dark Earth can be When Faith beholds it shine with Thee, Whose viewless Presence, arm'd with vital power, Irradiates each heart and hour:— Sea, air, and ocean with “laudamus” ring, “Te Deum,” hark! the planets sing; Each watching star that sentinels the night Grows eloquent with throbbing light, Till Souls below, with Saints above, Complete the litany of Love. And here, in this Ambrosian chant of praise High o'er the heaven of heavens we raise Heart, soul, and spirit, till we seem to blend Our lauds with theirs, which never end; But in eternity of chanting joy Each faculty of bliss employ,— Deep'ning above that coronation-hymn Harp'd from the lyres of Cherubim To One in Three, and Three in One Infinite Essence unbegun! Nine versicles of anthem'd praise we pour Round the I am our souls adore: And, what a company with us shall meet With songs to gird the Mercy-seat! Apostle, Prophet, Saint, and Martyr there, Angel, and Seraph,—more than words declare Of Beings countless as the rays of noon, Each chord of rapture now attune; And cast their coronets before Thee, Centre of uncreated Glory! And oh! that these reluctant hearts of ours Were not so loveless, with their powers; Then would they “cry aloud,” and louder still, And yon supernal Arches fill With lauding thunders of melodious song,— By Angels, as they roll'd along, Re-echo'd back to eucharistic earth Enrich'd with their celestial worth!— Thus would our lives religion be, By praise return'd to Deity. To live, is mercy! not a pulse, or breath, But preaches His vicarious Death, Whose Blood redeem'd us from that yawning hell Justice unveil'd, when Adam fell: But, never can mere finite numbers count Of mercies our immense amount Morn, noon, and night!—In all we hope, or feel, The Trinity this truth reveal,— Creation only by the Cross Becomes a gain, and not a loss. Hence, Lauds and Litanies alone can bless Hearts which the Triune God confess,— Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost divine, The True and Everlasting Trine! And Him, who did not spurn the Vestal womb, But rose refulgent from the tomb To perfect glory in Paternal Bliss, Ruling the world, by purchase His; Thence to return, and from the Throne Reward the Souls He calls His own. “Number'd with Saints!”—not less, nor more, we ask To cheer us in life's weary task: Lord of The Spirit! teach us how to pray, As here we tread that narrow way Whose windings by Thy sacred Feet were trod When Earth beheld her weeping God:— Our perill'd hearts secure from impious sin, By law without, and love within; “Te Deum!” then, our souls will cry, And while we live, shall learn to die. Benedicite. “O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise Him, and magnify Him for ever.” —Prayer Book. In creed, like Seraphim we soar, In conduct, low as dust descend! And, while our lips a God adore Our wills pursue a godless end. If thus discordant, life departs, Why marvel that, the jubilee Creation hymns round Christian hearts, Is neither loved, nor learn'd by thee? Untuned men are by Self and Sin For those deep harmonies which roll Around the list'ning ear within, When Nature's anthem woos the soul. But, oh, thou stern and songless Mind, Hark! how the universal choir Of chanting wave and choral wind Rebukes the Heart's unechoing lyre! Ungenial soul! the Church obey, Thy canticle with Hers combine; And echo back the ceaseless lay All creatures sing to Love Divine. Mountain and sea, with sun and moon, Waters and winds, and frost and dew, Night with clear stars, and sultry noon, And young-eyed morning, bright and blue; Lightning and cloud, and storm and calm, Forests and floods, with ice and snow,— From all, and each, a conscious psalm Through earth's wide Temple seems to flow. And, 'mid the worship of their praise Let christian Levites, pure in heart, With Priests and Angels, blend their lays,— In perfect chorus taking part. Creation and the Church united, Hosannah! both appear to cry, As if by Seraph-choirs invited Their equal God to glorify. While thus a more than music rolls From vast creation's varied round, Echoes awake in list'ning souls Attuned to such ethereal sound. God's universe a Poem seems Written by His creative Hand; And Faith, in her entrancèd dreams, Each mystic tone would understand: A throbbing lyre of holy love The heart baptized for heaven should be, Whose inmost pulse is heard above, And thrills incarnate Deity,— Flesh of our flesh! e'en from the same His beating heart of love replies To hymning Saints, who laud His name And lift to heaven their asking eyes. Benedictus. “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.” —Luke i. 68. Soft as the warbled flow of some unwritten line Heard by a Poet's ear, when verse is most divine, Swells the deep under-hymn of pious souls, As in melodious hours, the heavenly-musing heart By prayer and praise recalls the Goodness which Thou art, God of all grace! Whose will the world controls. But, high o'er all should soar the Soul's celestial lay, And “Benedictus” chant for that almighty day By hoary prophet in the Temple sung, When by the Spirit moved, as Harbinger of grace The new-born John was named, to “go before His face,” On Whose redemption-smile the world has hung. Dumb was the time-worn Seer; but at the radiant thought That God's incarnate Light to this dark world was brought, The mute became magnificent in speech! And, like a torrent broke from his enraptured soul An outburst of high song, whose heaven-born numbers roll With truths beyond what quiring Angels reach! But if the “Dayspring” thus by its pale gleam inspired And with such fervid joy one Jewish bosom fired,— Can they be dumb, who in the golden light Of Love's consummate noon see ev'ry heart, and home, And Mercy shield the paths where'er our footsteps roam, To guard the faith and guide their feeling right? Forbid it, pard'ning Grace!—so infinitely grand That Uncreated Eyes alone have search'd and scann'd Each height of wisdom, and each depth of love: Salvation for the soul!—oh, Miracle divine! Where all meridian beams in concentration shine, Which burn and brighten in God's heart above. Creation into Christ Atonement hath baptized, Nor, out of this pure creed, can earth, or heaven, be prized: And blest are they who thus the Godhead know; To open duty call'd, or shrined in secret prayer, Engirdled by dark grief, or clouded o'er by care,— Around them gleams of Calv'ry ever glow. 'Tis not for self, and sin, or aught base Earth admires, And flesh-born Passion seeks, to light its Belial-fires, Our ransom from the bleeding Saviour came; But, holiness of heart for man to have, and love, Drew from His awful Throne the Lord of heaven above, And nail'd Him on the Cross of bitter shame. Hence, o'er regen'rate life this mottoed banner waves,— “Freemen from Sin are Souls, but unto Duty, slaves;” Behold! the Sign by which they triumph all Who in the cross of Christ have crucified the world, And when their human joys are into ruin hurl'd Eternity a true Possession call. Jubilate. “Be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands!” —Ps. c. 6. Shout! for the Lord is King Enthroned in sceptred glory: Enter His courts, and loudly sing What swells through sainted Story,— A lyric ecstasy by nations chanted To whose converted hearts the light of Heaven is granted. Not sinful needs alone Find in the Church supply; But hymns of each exulting tone Like echoes from the Sky, Her choral love hath graciously bestow'd, To cheer lone pilgrims on through Faith's ascending road! Of old, the priest-led throng Felt in this thrilling strain Their bounding spirits bright, and strong,— Prolong it, then, again! That thus in concert old and new may meet, One Church of Saints to form, before God's mercy-seat. Far Lands, and famous Isles, All nations, tongues, and men, Where sea-waves roll, or sunbeam smiles, Join with us, where and when Adoring myriads lift this lauding Chant High o'er the echoing heavens, with gladness jubilant Sense, Earth, and Time are joys, The gods of carnal will; And Passion, 'mid their pagan noise, Heaven's chaster voice and “still” 1 Kings xix. 12. Can seldom hear, which thrills a sainted Heart That, meek and Mary-like, prefers the better part. An unbreathed psalm within, A wordless chant of thought, Hosannah! o'er some vanquish'd sin, With melody are fraught,— But, too etherial for Expression's lyre, They tremble up to God, and tearfully expire! Yet, through Thy Temple, Lord, Divine contagion burns When hymns that float upon Thy word Act, and re-act by turns; Until, resounding like one blended whole, Soars through the list'ning skies a myriad-voicèd Soul! So be it, Saviour dear! Creation's Lord and Light; Our fainting rapture's fallen tear,— Make it an Iris bright Which miniatures to all, who see by grace, That Rainbow Rev. iv. 3. round the Throne, Thy Church exults to trace. Ransom'd by Blood Divine, Why should we dread to sing, And offer on Love's hallow'd shrine The holocaust we bring?— Hearts which can quiver with Thy Name, and cry “Oh, worship Him, ye Heavens! in Whom we live, and die.” Magnificat. “My soul doth magnify the Lord: and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.” —Prayer Book. The Virgin-Mother of the Lord art Thou, In Flesh array'd when Christ on earth was found, Thou “blessed” One! along whose vestal brow Beams more than Womanhood, with lustre crown'd,— A radiance, Purity alone can see, Cast from Thy Son, incarnate Deity! Man cannot think, nor vocal Mind reveal What deep religion of adoring awe, High o'er all Women raised! 'twas thine to feel When first thy faith the Incarnation saw,— To whom alone of all the Sex 'twas given Pure on thy breast to place the Lord of Heaven! If, when by pale and speechless lips is felt The flutt'ring pressure of a new-born kiss, Emotions more than human seem to melt The mother of that babe who brings her bliss,— How can mere poetry of speech, or thought, Be with the echoes of thy feeling fraught When the first glance, or touch, or tone there came From God as Infant, on thy soul and sense, While loving awe beheld that sinless Frame Whose weakness clad Omnipotence!— Or, mutely gazing, on maternal breast Worshipp'd and watch'd th' Eternal Babe at rest. We, with our Lord are mystic One combined But He, from her organically drew Flesh of our flesh, in Which redeem'd mankind The Second Adam of salvation view:— Time and eternity, with heaven and earth, Blend and embrace in such almighty Birth. The awful grandeurs of the Virgin's lot Our mental limits are too mean to hold; Scarce in these hearts abides one holy spot, But zeal impassion'd, or harsh reason cold Mars what is due to her the Lord who bore,— And yet, a Woman, Whom no Saints adore. But wisdom grasps what faith has learn'd and loved,— She, by conception, hath in Christ reversed, And the dread birth-stain born of Eve, removed; And from her sex, in travail-woe accursed, Roll'd off the burden!—so that mothers, now, Lift o'er their throes a heaven-illumined brow. Fount of pure Blessings! which all worlds have blest, Whose finite substance, infinitely raised, Pass'd into Godhead, and became a Vest Veiling Those Beams on which no eye hath gazed,— A sackcloth'd Universe would fail to show The full expression of our boundless woe Had Earth been left without atonement, still! But, from the Egypt of degraded sin By holy Exodus of heart and will, E'en from a manger, did the Lord begin Back to their God a forfeit-race to lead, And win by merit all the World can need. The shaded Glories of Incarnate God How awful, in meek loveliness, they shine!— Shrouded by Flesh, as o'er the Earth He trod He walk'd creation with a step divine; And yet, so bland, a babe was once beguiled And on “The Man of Sorrows” look'd, and smiled! Begun by Gabriel, down the tides of Time Saluting tones, in reverential love, Prolong the echoes of that “Hail!” sublime, Mother of Him the Heavens enshrine above! Thou Handmaid of the Lord, in “low estate,’ Sinful,—and yet beyond all sinners, great! Ave Maria! Thee will souls revere Long as one life-pulse in the Church remains, And in “Magnificat” that Spirit hear Who on the throne of Scripture rules, and reigns; And by “pure language” Zeph. iii. 9. of embodied grace Symbols the God-Man who redeem'd our race. Cantate. “O sing unto the Lord a new song: for He hath done marvellous things.” —Ps. xcviii. Pilgrims in a world of pain, While we suffer, still we reign: 2 Tim. ii. 12. Through a wilderness of woe Onward as our marches go, Oft may heave the inward sigh, Sadly droop the sunken eye, Haunting grief and harrowing care Circle round us, everywhere,— Yet, in heaven we have a King, And beneath His banner sing Jubilate! Jubilate! Lift we, then, our lyric song Full and fervent, loud and long: Hallelujah! Lord on high For the gotten victory.— Rev. xv. 2. Music is a gift divine Dedicate to Thee, and Thine; Organ, trump, and raptured lyre, Let Thy Glories now inspire, Till our diapason blend Far as Earth and Man extend, Jubilate! Jubilate! Seas which rock and mountain lave, Viewless wind, and vassal wave, Ps. xcviii. 8. Floods that bathe the fertile Lands Swell the choir, and clap your hands; Rivers round the rolling world, Storms, amid the skies unfurl'd,— All of great, sublime, or glorious Cite we now to chant before us Jubilate! Jubilate! Praise the Lord! again, again Let our souls prolong the strain: Victorious waves th' Almighty Arm Shielding earth and heaven from harm; Mercy, Truth, and Righteousness Evermore the people bless; While the ransom'd world around Hear the wafted tidings sound “Salvation!”—Jew and Gentile, both Find it in God's awful oath, Acts ii. 30. Jubilate! Jubilate! Hail we, then, the Prince of Peace; Blood Divine proclaims release; Guilt in grace shall now depart, Till the glow of each glad heart Mirror back that righteous Sun, Mal. iv. 2. By Whose radiance souls are won Out of darkness into light, With the beams of Godhead bright,— Jubilate! Jubilate! Children of the Cross are we, Shout we, hence, our Jubilee: Time may frown, and Flesh may fear; Oft descend the heart-drawn tear; Hopes depart, and homes decay; All fond Edens fade away; Sickness, anguish, grief, and pain Over hearth and household reign, But the Church will ever sing Lauds to Her celestial King,— Jubilate! Jubilate! Nunc Dimittis. “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word.” —Luke ii. 29. Oh! to have watch'd his lifted eye, Illumed with heaven-born ecstasy When Simeon clasp'd the awful Child, And, while he held Him to his heart, Cried,—“Let Thy servant now depart For he hath seen Thine Undefiled!” Heb. vii. 26. Encradled in his circling arms, How mused he o'er those infant Charms That priested Saint of hope and prayer; And, while he hymn'd forth hallow'd praise, Centred on heaven a prescient gaze, And felt his waiting home was—there! Brimm'd like a wine-cup full and flowing, The gladden'd spirit, brightly-glowing, In “Nunc Dimittis” over-ran; Since, what to him were earth and sense And all the dream-joys they dispense, Since now he saw the Hope of Man? Type, Promise, and Prediction blend Here in their true eternal End,— Christ to forecast, as Woman-born: What Patriarchs yearn'd by faith to know, What Prophets soar'd in heaven to show,— He witness'd on this wondrous morn! And yet, this centre-point of Time Was mark'd by nought men dream sublime, Which rocks the earth, or rends the air: A hoary Priest, with sainted mien, Mother and Babe, alone were seen Assembled round the Shrine of prayer. Thus, secret, silent, sudden, oft In works below, or ways aloft, God moves o'er some mysterious line Converging round Salvation's plan, Decreed for everlasting Man In viewless depths of Will Divine. And grant, O Lord! whene'er they kneel Around Thine Altar, souls may feel Though all seems noiseless, lone, and still,— E'en while they ponder, mourn, or pray, Commission'd Angels wing their way Some hidden purpose to fulfil. Barr'd in by sense, profanely-blind, The world-slave with his sunken mind God's marching Host can never track; But Saints, encamp'd along the skies Can see seraphic Armies rise To hurl, or hold, His Thunder back! The seeing eye, the hearing ear, Bestow, O Lord! that life's career Inspired may be with inward awe,— That welcomes through each tranquil hour Thy Dove, in His descending power, Like that the sacred Jordan saw. Yet, few to Thee, themselves dare give: Earth seems so bright,—they long to live; The grave so dark,—they dread to die; But, Simeon-like, Lord, let us see A heaven of love in loving Thee, And calm would heave our closing sigh! Clasp we but Christ within the heart, And then,—“Lord! let us now depart” Will deeply rise from many a soul: With “Nunc Dimittis” our last breath Shall waft us o'er the gulph of Death To where no shades of darkness roll. Deus Misereatur. “God be merciful unto us; and shew us the light of His countenance.” —Ps. lxvii. 1. Taught by heaven-lore, the Soul can see A sacramental Type of Thee Who art Incarnate Deity.— When from a living throne of light The Sun unveils his forehead bright And melts the mournful shades of night, Verdure and freshness, bud and flower, Meadow and glade, with garden-bower Array'd in Beauty's vernal power, Spring from his fertile reign of beams; And leaping wave, and laughing streams, With all Creation's poet dreams That Orb arrays with his bright spell:— But, when the hues of Twilight tell The regal Sun must beam farewell, Pale gleams bedeck the ocean-brim, And low Winds chant a vesper-hymn Like tones from dream-heard Seraphim; The Moon comes forth in meek array, And o'er the dim nocturnal way Reflects the glow of sinking day. And thus, Rev. xii. 1. O Lord! Thy Church may shine In radiance caught from Thee, and Thine, O'er hearts and homes, with sway divine. Since Thou, true Sun of Righteousness! Art veil'd within Thy Act i. 9. cloud-recess, Her office 'tis, to light and bless Each empire, land, or lonely isle With beams, which are Thy borrow'd smile, And be Thy Mirror, for awhile; Till Thou again in glory rise With radiant Matt. xxiv. 27. outburst o'er the skies, And dazzle Earth's uplifted eyes! Then, Lord of everlasting grace, Bend Thou on us Thy mercy-face And bid each there a Father trace; That, reconciled and calm'd by prayer, Thy Church may far and wide declare That Christ is All, Col. iii. 11. and everywhere: For, catholic is christian love; And all baptised for heaven above, Lost in themselves, the Saviour prove. And, may that scene Isaiah See his Prophecies (passim). chanted, Soon to regen'rate earth be granted,— When by Thy mystic Body planted Gentile and Jew in oneness blend, And from all hearts to heaven ascend Salvation-hymns which never end! Rev. vii. 10. The Apostles' Creed. “He that cometh unto God must believe that He is.” —Heb. xi. 6. Like infant-birds, when first they soar and sing And flutter upward with imperfect wing, Mount the young feelings of a virgin Heart To where, O Living Sun of Souls! Thou art. Trembling on timid plume, they yearn to rise, Nobly attracted by congenial skies, Yet, oft they quiver with a downward fall As though the earth would back their flight recall. When thus the world our gravitation proves, The heart sinks earthward to the soil it loves; Till faith seems baffled in its lofty soar And leaves the Man terrestrial as before. Living “epistles,” 2 Cor. iii. 20. writ by God's own pen, Whose lips say “credo,” and whose lives, “amen,”— How often thus the envious charms of Earth Subdue th' attraction of their spirit-birth! A distance of indwelling sin there lies Between the “credo” which Confession cries, And what we practise with regen'rate will Whose law is,—“though He slay thee, trust Him still!” E'en to the last, mysterious life is found A war of Principle, on Passion's ground, Which sainted Heroes dare alone to face When duly panoplied with inward grace. As all things, save itself, our eye surveys,— The world we scan, but not our own bad ways; While bland Deception, with her blinding charm Guides the veil'd progress of an inward harm. And thus, baptised idolators may be In Temples, dedicate to Deity, Who, while they glorify Jehovah's claim Commit Self-worship in that awful Name. Yet, not for this, reject that time-hoar'd Creed For which the Church hath vow'd to burn, and bleed, Or, grasp uninjured to her latest breath, And enter with it through the gates of Death. Type, or Deposit, Form, or Trust, or Rule, Whate'er the name,—that Creed becomes a school Where perfect doctrines educate the soul And lead it God-ward, with a just control. Quintessence exquisite of saving Truth For rev'rend Age, or more impassion'd Youth,— The pure aroma of a Book Divine Where breathes the Spirit through each burning line, Such is that Creed—whose apostolic Source Affects the conscience with persuasive force; And, when we hear it round our Temples ring, Plumes the glad soul as with seraphic wing. Oh! that our character and creed might move In one sweet parallel of perfect love! Oh! that those lips which utter, “I believe,” Echo'd brave hearts, which ne'er Christ's banner leave! Thou only Giver of faith's glorious heart, Celestial Teacher of the Truth Thou art; Impress our spirits more and more to feel That Life must practise, what our lips reveal. Such the Confession which our Lord approves, The Scriptures sanction, and the Godhead loves, Whose words embody what no speech can say— A living comment on the Truth, and Way. Creed of St. Athanasius. “The Catholic Faith is this,—That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.” —Athanasius. Oh! say not that the Church's creed Is harsh and haughty, cold or stern, But rather, in each Symbol read Truths which the Lord would have us learn: Since hate, not love, alone conceals What truthful language there reveals. Nature seems Athanasian oft,— Her guarded ways are most severe: To earth below, or skies aloft, What fencing laws define her sphere! Infringe but these,—and they resent, And make Man know his element. Thus, Matter frames a creed for Sense, And Science, too, her dogma finds, And dares a shadowy faith dispense To those who train their studious minds By canons, which Creation hath, To guide them through some devious path. But, if the church of Nature seems To symbolise a Creed and Code, In vain the darken'd sceptic dreams That Faith can have no certain road:— As if religion were a plan For making Truth the slave of Man! Our Intellect on trial stands, In thinking age, or thoughtless youth; And when the heart by grace expands To welcome in God's saving truth, E'en then, the power of plastic will Impresses creed and conduct, still. Tyrannic Reason, hence, must bow, And from the Bible learn her law; And with confessing zeal avow The truth, which Saints and Martyrs saw,— That Three in One and One in Three Image the awful Trinity. Incarnate God, and God Triune, The Persons, Three, the Nature, One,— Doctrines with this, when not in tune Are discords, in the Faith begun, From whence flow errors, madly wild, Sabellian dreams, and Sects defiled. Yet, not by oral praise alone, Absolving Lord of heavenly love! We clasp Thy Trinitarian throne, And lift on speech our souls above;— Creeds are but breaths which die away, Unless we practise what we pray. Hence may Thy Priesthood, all-divine, The Trinity to each impart, And, while our names partake of Thine, A temple build in every heart:— In Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Be Sin and Self for ever lost! Then shall we learn, by love to know, And not by science, coldly scan What to the Trinity we owe Of boundless mercy, brought to Man; And, as we worship, more and more Resemble Him our hearts adore. Collect for Peace. “O God, Who art the Author of Peace, and Lover of Concord.” Prayer Book. Peace cannot live from Purity apart, Nor find a temple in the fleshly heart: But when affections chaste and lowly The soul anoint, and make it holy, A Saint becomes a living shrine For deepest calm of Love Divine. Yet, conscience, not condition, peace attains, Since life is warfare with mysterious pains; While, all around us, fiends and foes Mingle, and multiply our woes, And from the cradle to the grave Christ's army must His banner wave. In the dread language of the Holy Ghost,— Legions of Angels, from the Lord's bright Host, Camp'd round the warring Church of old: But in the Prince of Peace, behold! The blandness of that “better” way Our Christian Zion shows to-day. What, though we combat with some clashing ill, The halcyon-breath of holiness can still The fevers in man's restless heart, And tranquillising grace impart,— Serenity of soul within Which broods o'er baffled self, and sin. But, who interprets what is meant by “peace,” Or weighs the treasures of that true release When rolls away our legal curse, And nothing in God's universe Impinges on that secret Plan Where “all things work” for pardon'd Man? Sickness and sorrow, anguish, grief, and gloom, All blended trials which precede the tomb, Dread though they look, to carnal sense,— Foil'd by a spell of faith, dispense Their healing magic to the mind, And work some charm by Heaven design'd. While penance-fires of ever-during pain Burn the pierced hearts where sins unpardon'd reign,— Broods o'er each saint a mystic Dove, Who shadows with the wings of love That Spirit, with whose bosom-lot A stranger intermeddles not. God of such peace! Thy lulling grace impart; Be to Thy Church, what in Thyself Thou art,— “Lover of Concord,” in Whose light All “service” is a freedom bright; While grace and glory flow from Thee To fill our vast eternity! Perill'd we are; but, panoplied with charms Destined to keep the soul from sinful harms, Saints enter on Life's battle-fields; And, cover'd by celestial shields, They are not crush'd by earth, or hell, But face them both, and fight them well! “Hosannah!” then, to Thee, Thou Prince of Peace, Never Thy sacramental Host will cease Beneath Thy boundless throne to cry,— On Whom our hopes for heaven rely, And round Whose Form, as Priest, and King, Adoring Worlds due homage bring. Collect for Grace. “Grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger.” —Prayer Book. Grace is a gift Divine to man When God Himself to us imparts: Give more than this, not e'en th' Almighty can, And less, would never feed our famish'd hearts! Yet, little dream men, when they ask For Grace to sanctify the Will, How much in heaven their intercessions task Whose answers perfectly that prayer fulfil! What Angels neither have, nor need,— Pardon by awful Blood procured, Wrung from His heart Who came in flesh to bleed And save a shipwreck'd world from God allured,— The children of the Church inherit, Born of free grace, baptised, and blest; And, meekly looking to His glorious merit, On His dread Sacrifice securely rest. Such grace is dawning Christ within, A type and prophecy of all The wonders, which from boundless Love begin To rescue earth from Adam's ruin-fall. Without it, what is Man, at best, But Godless culture, proud and vain,— A self-made Idol, in false radiance dress'd, Doom'd for destruction, Is. ii. 18. when the Lord shall reign? Hence, pray we, God! for grace divine, Whose inward reign is heaven begun: And, prostrate at the angel-crowded Shrine, Seek the vast mercies our Emanuel won. For ever, round the deep Unknown Life flutters like a fearful thing; Nor can we dream, before the day is flown, How the crush'd heart with guilt, or woe, may wring! New are Thy mercies, each fresh morn, To us, from perill'd slumber brought; And none are left to roam the world forlorn Who think on Thee, as Thou Ps. cxxxix. 17. on them hast thought. Ah! who can say, in helpless sleep What viewless Fiends around us stand? Or, when Morn smiles, how men would weep Had no night-angels camp'd Ps. xxxiv. 7. on either hand? But, Day brings danger more than Night!— Without, within, a countless throng Of tempting charms seduce us from the right, And paint a paradise in doing wrong. Father in Heaven! our Home above, The soul defend with “mighty power;” Brighten our darkness with Thy beams of love And guard, and guide us, through each devious hour. Thus, dreading nought which Man can be, Pursue we, Lord, our destined way; And, weak in self, grow strong by loving Thee, Learning to live, the more we live, to pray. “That which is righteous in Thy sight,”— Here is the type, the master-test! A faultless standard of celestial Right, Which nobly shields us from the World's unrest. Opinions are chameleon-hues Cast from a creature's fickle heart, But, when all standards we can dare refuse Save that, which Thou by revelation art, O God! then life becomes a hallow'd Thing, A Liturgy of praise, and prayer; And Saints, in deepest martyrdom, can sing “Christ is my heaven, and He reigns everywhere!” Second Collect at Evening Prayer. “O God! from Whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed.” —Prayer Book. Meek and lowly, meek and lowly, Bend we now before Thy Throne: Sad and slowly, sad and slowly, All our sinful burdens own: Hear us, Lord! and to each heart Virtue from Thyself Mark v. 30. impart. False and faithless, false and faithless Though we prove in Life's vain scene, True and scathless, true and scathless All Thy Promises have been: Though our faith has often falter'd, Love Divine has never alter'd! Source of blessing, Source of blessing, Vital Root of heavenward joy! While caressing, while caressing Pleasures free from base alloy, Let us, wing'd on plumes of love, Hover round our Homes above. All proceeding, all proceeding High and holy from the heart, Proves Thy pleading, proves Thy pleading, Priest Almighty, as Thou art!— Winning from Paternal Grace Gifts surpassing 1 Cor. ii. 9. thought to trace. Still array Her, still array Her As Thy mystic Bride on earth, And display Her, and display Her Beaming with immortal birth, That Thy Church in truth may be Sanctified by unity. Heaven-breath'd quiet, heaven-breath'd quiet, Dove Celestial! now bestow; Far from riot, far from riot Onward may our footsteps go; Till, at length, we reach the goal, And in Godhead rest the soul. Meek and lowly, meek and lowly Kneel we thus before the Shrine; Sad and slowly, sad and slowly Supplicate the Heart Divine:— Thou, Who art the world's release, Rule and reign, as Prince of Peace! Collect for Aid against all Perils. “Lighten our darkness, we beseech Thee, O Lord.” —Prayer Book. “Lighten our darkness!”—down yon placid west The day is dying with a dream-like glow; The babe creeps closer to its mother's breast, And o'er the forest chilling eve-winds blow. A mystic robe of shadow and of shade Enwraps creation, in this pensive hour; Garden, and grove, and every woodland-glade Seem all pervaded with religious power. Sea, air, and sky, as night-glooms onward steal, Wind round the heart an interwoven spell; And soul and sentiment alike can feel A voiceless sympathy with Day's farewell. Fountain of Radiance! be our guardian-friend, Whose smile almighty makes a noon of night; Whate'er dark perils may around us blend, Let but that beam,—and all within, is bright! Then will Thy spirit-rays of truth and love Dart pure effulgence on each hour of prayer, Till Faith shall realise her Lord above, And hail the lustres which encrown Him, there. Safe through this day of fever, care, and toil, Thy secret Grace our perill'd life has kept; And shielded, in the midst of earth's turnmoil, The hands which struggled, or the hearts that wept. But now, as night-born dangers round us throng In aidless slumber while these bodies rest, Giver of Sleep! Ps. cxxvii. 2. to Whom our dreams belong, May Heaven's own balm allay the ruffled breast! Camp'd near each couch, let min'st'ring Angels be To guard the sleeper, and defend his soul; While holy visions, sent from heaven and Thee, Chasten the fancy with divine control. All “perils” vanish, where Thy power doth reign; Darkness and danger prove unharmful things; Hell dares not tempt, nor Hate inflict one pain When Slumber dreams beneath celestial Wings. Ps. xxx. 7. Light, is Thy name, and Love, Thy nature, too, Since, Lord, on each Thy Church must e'er rely; And, thus, in all Thou bid'st her dare or do, Find perfect bliss in Thine approving eye. Waking or sleeping,—boots it not, for those Whose inward All is God by grace reveal'd:— In harrowing labour, or in hush'd repose, Their life is heavenward, in the Lord conceal'd. Col. iii. 3. “Lighten our darkness,” thus, we lift the prayer,— Yet, light and dark are both alike to Thee, Head of that Church, Whose home is everywhere Where faith is vital, and the conscience free. Collect for the Queen's Majesty. Lord of all lords! and King of kings! How can that Church unloyal be, Who views in all majestic things Some answ'ring Type, which tells of Thee As God's Anointed, monarchs sway, And in their sceptre, crown, and throne Faith can discern a borrow'd ray Of Him, Whom Saints and Seraphs own. Thy charter'd Deputies they are By Grace, and not by Compact, Ps. xl. 100. given,— Princes who rule in peace and war, And have their title-deeds in heaven. And should'st Thou, O mysterious God! Let tyranny and torture rise, And Despots, with an iron rod, A sacred freedom sacrifice, Our weapon shall be prayers, and tears, Persuasion mild and moral strength, With all by which our righteous fears To kings are spoken out, at length. But, far as hell be regicides, Rebellion, blood, and lawless will! Our model is The Crucified, And crucifixion says—“Be still!” See Filmer and Sanderson; also, a well-known Sermon, preached before the University of Oxford, Nov. 5, 1840. Like plagues and earthquakes, fire and flood, Whate'er the penal curse may be, Bad Rulers are, to try the good, And punish Earth's iniquity. Through wicked kings, some wickedness In justice oft stern Heaven declares; And when our vices rankle less, False Empires will be freed from theirs. Prayer for the Royal Family. “Fountain of all Goodness, we humbly beseech Thee to bless all the Royal Family.” —Prayer Book. Scions of a kingly race! In whose features myriads trace Futurity with awful joy, Cold the hearts which gaze on ye, While no pulse of sympathy, Throbs to behold some princely Boy,— Or regal Maiden, on whose brow Diadem'd with beauty now, A jewell'd crown may one day rest, When her sceptred Hand shall wield Empire over minds that yield Allegiance, which The Lord We and all her subjects, duly considering Whose authority she hath.” —Collect in Communion Service. hath blest. Youth begets prophetic awe: Who its fair brow ever saw Nor inly felt some prescient thought O'er his spirit dimly cast,— Shaping, when dread years have past, With what a doom life may be fraught! Cottage-babes in cradle sleeping, Orphan'd infants, wan and weeping, Each might thrill the soul of prayer Did we ponder,—what a Soul Fated for immense control, In weakness may lie shrouded there! But, if thus the lowly can Thrill the mind of thinking Man, How fearfully we gaze on those,— Offspring of a royal Line, Rulers by a Law divine, To whom the Isle-queen fealty owes! Purest Fount of perfect Good, By Whose word and will hath stood Firm, fast, and free, our public Weal! Prosper, and enrich with grace Princess of majestic race, And let them all Thine Unction feel. May Thy Spirit each endue With all motives, high and true,— Children who are dawning Kings! Props, and Pillars let them prove To each cause the holy love, O'ershadow'd by Jehovah's wings. Ever may a virtuous line Like the circling olive Ps. cxxviii. 3. twine Around the Sovereign's regal board; And as long as Britain smiles From Her triple-throne of Isles, Be each and all with blessings stored. Nations unto Christ belong: By Him strengthen'd, are they strong, From Whom the sceptred Empires draw Principles which guard and guide All which makes Britannia's pride,— Her civic Weal, by Christian-law! King of kings! and Lord of lords! Sanction these adoring words Our litanies intone before Thee; Church and Crown, oh, let them be Wedded in themselves, and Thee, And both will brighten in Thy glory. Prayer of St. Chrysostom. “Granting us in this world knowledge of Thy truth, and in the world to come, life everlasting.” —Prayer Book. Oh! that our World became one choral hymn Chanted as by incarnate Seraphim, Which, pausing never, And deepening ever, Mounted and mingled with those strains that roll Round the heaven-Throne of Him, of all the Spring and Soul. Oh! that accordant Earth, by Common Prayer Her loving Oneness in the world could share, And thus defy That master-lie,— That Creeds are choice, and Churches chance-made things, Featured, and form'd alone from Man's imaginings! Union is life, and life in union dwells; Each works on each, by love's re-active spells: But discord—death! Whose serpent-breath Envenoms with contaminating guile The moral powers within, and makes them vain and vile; Since deep in Godhead John xvii. 11. true foundations lie For that dread Sacrament of Unity, Which binds us all To Him we call Head of the “Body,” in Whose life John xiv. 10. each tone Seems like an echoing throb, which thus repeats His Own. Heaven is all Love, and Harmony, and Law, Symmetric Holiness without a flaw; And, did we yearn By love to learn,— Intenser concord would each soul inspire As flame meets answ'ring flame, and so, augments the fire! All thrilling foretastes of millenial joy Sectarian novelties at once destroy; And where they reign In harsh disdain, Mangled and marr'd, just unities depart, And heathen Self becomes the Satan of the heart. Thee we invoke, then, Lord of grace, and gift! And far above the heavens our prayer uplift, That, more and more We may adore Father, and Son, and sempiternal Spirit, And feel the Church is One, by Jesu's dying merit. Blest Paraclete! from Whom pure unions flow, More than Thy Self not mercy can bestow; And less than Thee Will never be Enough, to fill the vast abyss which lies In famish'd hearts that need what Christ alone supplies. Final Blessing. “Grace be with us all, evermore.” —Prayer Book. The heart is harden'd through itself alone By Passion's indurating law; And, save from Godhead, who that living stone Subdued and soften'd, ever saw? Man forms the sinner; but, a Saint must be A Spirit-birth, direct from Deity! As Adam, once, from throned perfection fell Down guilty depths of gloom, and woe, So, from the curse of sin's commencing hell Celestial ransom must we owe To that true Life, which God and Grace impart When seeds of Glory sanctify the heart. Helpless in Self, but hopeful in their God, Disciples learn their state to prove:— So felt the sainted Martyrs who have trod Those mystic paths meek Angels Matt. vi. 10. love; Christ was their All; and He is e'er the same, To all regen'rate in His glorious Name! Culture and science, art and boundless skill, With all endowments Nature grants, Are heathen,—if they leave the bosom still A soil for those unhallow'd plants Doom'd Matt. xv. 13. to be rent from their disastrous root, And burnt, because they bear an impious fruit. And thus, Anointer of our inward Man! By one vast prayer they compass all Which in redemption's Trinitarian plan Thy hidden ones their heirship call,— When, grace, and love, and Fellowship divine Priests for the people seek before the Shrine! Numb. vi. 25. THE LITANY. 1. In its Idea. “Then followeth the Litany, or General Supplication.” —Rubric. From God Himself, the Fount of prayer, Have Litanies proceeded, Where superhuman tones declare What saint, or sinner, needed: Thus did the Bard of Zion lift His “Miserere”-cry; And Daniel seek a pardon-gift With face toward the sky. And thus, of old, did Heaven command Priesthood and people.—“there, Between the Porch and Altar stand,” And cry, “Jehovah! spare!” E'en once, the weeping God-Man pray'd His litany of tears, While breaking heart and blood betray'd The agony of fears! Heb. v. 7. What, though no more Procession leads A fasting, barefoot throng, Sad nature and her myriad-needs Yet to the Cross belong: Still mercy is our master-want, And helpless guilt the plea, Nor lives a Soul, who should not chant, “Be gracious, Lord! to me.” And, glory be to Him Who gives His Church both prayer, and praise! That Liturgy, on which She lives, Boasts of primeval days; Since, not from East, or West, alone, But cull'd from ancient time,— It breathes an Apostolic tone How simple, and sublime! Here, Priest and People, both unite Each audibly to pray, While hov'ring mercies round them light, To answer what they say. And, could that Litany obtain From God what there is pleaded, Dead Paradise might bloom again, And prayer be superseded! Intensely-earnest, truthful, deep, Impassion'd, chaste, severe, Pathetic, as when spirits weep And shed the God-known tear, Embracing individual heart, Yet, catholic as all,— Humanity Itself takes part When thus on Christ we call. 2. Invocation. “O God, the Father of Heaven, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners.” —The Litany. Thee we invoke, Thou Father-God! Thine erring Children all, Who oft Perdition's way have trod But now, their steps recall:— Created by Thy faultless Power We broke creation-law; Nor can we name one conscious hour Which no corruption saw. Thee we invoke, Incarnate Lord! Whose Blood almighty flow'd And fill'd the wonders of Thy word With all such death bestow'd: Oh! did we live for Him Who died, A shadow from His Cross Would image forth the Crucified In every scene, and loss. Thee we invoke, in Godhead, Third! From Sire and Son proceeding, Who in Thy Sacraments and Word When souls are little heeding,— Art mystically there enshrined As fontal Source of all That soothes, or sanctifies mankind, When they for mercy call. Holy and undivided Three! And Three in One adored, From guilt-born anguish set us free, And be our sins deplored As heart-rebellions, dread and deep, Luke xix. 41. 'Gainst Father, Son, and Spirit, Like those which made Emanuel weep When Earth despised His Merit. Sadness and shame, and guilt and sorrow,— Haunted by these we move; But, Faith predicts a brighter morrow Of calm and cloudless love. Our pangs are great, yet Mercy reigns Above dark nature's doom, And out 1 Cor. xv. 55, 56. of guilt a glory gains Whose radiance fills the tomb! Hail! Trinity of grace Divine, The Sempiternal Holy, Prostrate before the mercy-shrine, Sackcloth'd with shame, and lowly, Our litanies we lift on high, And, by Thy Blood-drawn tears! Oh, waft some whisper from yon sky To lull tempestuous fears. Priest of all priests! in flesh Who died, That Man might live for ever; God in our nature crucified! Let sin, nor sorrow sever That Body Isaiah xxvi. 19. of believing hearts Who throne Thee as their King, And, when this dying world departs, Love's Easter-chant will sing. 3. Intercessions. “We sinners do beseech Thee to hear us, O Lord God.” —Litany. More genial than the glorious Sun, And wider than the Sea, Those Litanies our Church begun In hoar antiquity!— No accent of sectarian mind Contaminates their tone; But in them throbs for all Mankind A heart, like Jesu's own. So greet we now, with boundless love, Earth's family below, And supplicate our God above Alike for friend, and foe; But still, the sacramental ties Which bind the Lord's elect, Prompt from the soul those deeper cries Worldlings alone reject. Lamb of Jehovah! Light of Light! Saviour, and Son of God! Still may Thy Church pursue the right, The path Thy virtues trod: Govern, and guard, and inly guide, And teach her “how to pray,” Who is the Body, and the Bride Of Him, the Truth, and Way. And may th' Anointed of the Lord, Our Rulers, and our Kings, Sanction their sceptres with Thy Word And reign beneath Thy wings: Thus will our Throne, and Altar stand Co-ordinately blest; And richly o'er a christian land Heaven's radiant mercies rest. And, next to Thee, but nearer Thine, By supernat'ral law, The Clergy, to that care divine Cold prudence never saw,— Commit we now; that all, and each, In order and degree, May practise what their sermons preach, Like living Texts on Thee. Give wisdom unto Power, and Place; Ennoble all our Peers; While Justice, panoplied by grace, None but th' Almighty fears!— Since Magistrates Thine impress bear And are by Thee array'd, A shadow of Thy Crown to wear When Order is display'd. And, may the darken'd and deceived, Self-exiled from the Fold, Turn to That Spirit they have grieved, And yet, their Home behold;— True Home of faith, Thy Church, O God! The structure of Thy Will, When martyr'd saints in meekness trod Their way to Zion-hill. Strengthen beleaguer'd Hearts which stand, Shelter the wounded Dove, And o'er Thy fainting Ones expand Plumes of protecting Love: Succour and soothe the desolate, Allay the Widow's sigh; Nor let lone Orphans meet their fate, Without Compassion's eye. The helpless babe, the mother's throe, The dungeon'd captive's groan, Whate'er the hue of mortal woe Sickness, or health, may own,— Head of the Church! Incarnate Grace! To Thee we all commend; And in the features of Thy face See Father, God, and Friend. Nor, be our deepest foes forgot; Forgive each bitter wrong; And teach the lore this world knows not,— That love, not hate, is strong: Lost in Thy cleansing Blood-fount lie All feelings harsh, and stern, And from the warning of Thy sigh Mark vii. 34. Let Speech true wisdom learn. But oh! of gifts the crowning all, Thy Spirit, Lord! bestow; Without it, Faith herself must fall And weal become a woe: While conscience slumbers o'er the sin Veil'd in those depths unknown, Where Satan, from the heart within, In secret rears his throne! O, Lamb of God! O, Lord of lords! Saviour, and Sun of souls, This litany of erring words Ere into heaven it rolls,— Attuned by Thy perfecting love Grant that each tone may rise, And summon from The Heart above What God to prayer replies. 4. Deprecations. “Spare Thy people! whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy most precious blood.” —Litany. If Man be want, and God supply, And prayer unite the Two, Then may our Church the soul defy Her wisdom to outdo,— In seeking what she hath not sought 'Mid the vast world of need, From all in Godhead faith is taught Through pard'ning Love to plead. But, while the flesh-blind Sense believes, To suffer, is the worst Of pangs o'er which proud nature grieves, And ranks that evil first, The Church, endow'd with sight divine, In sin, not suff'ring, sees, When prostrate at the Christian shrine,— What most requires release. Lightning and thunder, plague and pest, Sickness, and pain, and fear, Whatever racks with deep unrest Our spirit-life's career,— Without, within, from friend or foe, Amid that vast and varied all Which makes the mingled sum of woe, Men sad experience call, Say, is not Sin the venom'd root, The vip'rous source and spring Of whatsoe'er, in flower or fruit, Our aching hearts can wring? So evil, that its boundless curse Nor God, nor man, can change!— Hell could not wish to make it worse, If once allow'd to range Uncheck'd in all its hideousness!— And hence, O Lord of grace We seek not now, in mere distress, One beam from Thy bright Face; But this our yearning souls would pray,— Freedom from awful sin! While in the true and living Way Our hearts pure triumph win. Ah! little boots it, what our doom Of ever-changing life; Whether, in radiance, or in gloom, In softness, or in strife We onward to Hereafter move, If pureness be our guide; Since all we need is heavenly Love, And Jesus at our side! And, Lord, without Thee, dark indeed Life's burden'd lot must be, Thou Balm alone to hearts that bleed From wounds which none can see But Thou!—Whose sympathetic eye Irradiates the soul, And brightens, when believers cry For Thy serene control. O, what is life in fallen Man, But one collected sin Against Love's everlasting Plan, Without, or from within? And hence, we suffer, while we live; To struggle, is to be; And, nought our selves to Self can give But lost eternity! Now, by Thine Agony and Blood, Thy Passion's bosom-groan, By more than Angels understood Who heard Thy garden-moan!— Incarnate, tempted, crucified, Buried, arisen Lord! We glory in Thy wounded Side, Thy Sacraments, and Word. And through all destined years Down to the brink of death, In Thee we hide our solemn fears, And with departing breath This litany the Church will cry,— “Deliver, Lord, and spare;” And when Thy throne o'erawes the sky, Oh! grant acquittal, there. 5. Supplication. “We beseech Thee to hear us, Good Lord.” —Prayer Book. With ardency, and not by Art Which earth-born skill inspires, Our Litany its closing part Rolls through responsive quires; Instinct with all that plaintive tone By persecution's horde Drawn from the Church, when left alone To suffer for her Lord;— Alone to man, and yet sustain'd By Him, the Ever-Nigh! When blood and battle round Her reign'd And war-fiends revell'd by: E'en then, while Rome's barbaric foes Trampled an Empire down, The Church in prayer to God arose And won her martyr-crown. The Crucified became Her Strength, The Cross, a weapon'd charm; And by Love's chivalry, at length, Was quell'd satanic harm: Mighty through meekness, thus she stood Miraculous by grace! And proved how martyr'd virtue could Rescue a perill'd race. What, though the hour of blood be past, Yet, militant on earth, Her lot amid that world is cast Who hates her awful worth: Still must she weep, and fast, and fight, And reap no placid rest, But feel dejection's aching might Burden her wounded breast. Hence, lift we now, as once of old United Martyrs did, Those Litanies which often roll'd From Saints, in caverns hid, When, hunted there by blood-hound zeal, Mangled adorers came, And felt, as only Martyrs feel,— His sacramental Name Who, in the fire and flood alike, As 'mid the Temple-calm, Though Rage her direst terror strike, Breathes omnipresent balm!— That peace which Purity bestows, The Halcyon of His grace, Whose promise through portentous woes Points to a heaven-bright place! Thus, Lamb of God! dread Sacrifice! For mercy still we pray; Nor shall the incense-prayers that rise Melt in mere breath away,— But, pleading at Thy Heart, shall bring Celestial answers down, And prompt the saddest Hour to sing, “The Cross shall win the Crown!” Atoner for the World's vast sin! Our ransom-Price is paid, And all we bear, without, within, When by Thy truth array'd, Is fraught with victory to Faith, Whate'er the doom may be,— Whose heart can hear the Love which saith, “Suffer, and follow Me!” 6. Prayer for Mercy. “That it may please Thee to have mercy on all men.” —Prayer Book. Adorable! yet unadored Too oft is Thy transcendent Name, O Thou! at Whose creative Word Forth sprang this universal Frame. Yet, mercy art Thou, measureless, Beyond all span of thought to reach; And through the Earth's vast diocess Ten thousand Tongues that mercy preach. Bright Orator, the burning sun Whose rays are eloquent of Thee And symbolise that righteous One Who brightens dark eternity,— Pale Vestal of the placid sky Encircled with each nun-like star Whose throbbing radiance fills the eye Which museth on it, faint and far,— These, with all the choral throng Which make yon firmamental lyre, Harp to the saintly Mind a song Whose tones celestial truths inspire. Thus, Ocean with her chime of waves, Meadow, and fruit, and wood-born flower, Each lends a voice, whose meaning saves The heart from ev'ry creedless hour. Yet, faintly such reveal Thy Name, Though whisper'd forth by sea, and air: For God alone can God proclaim, And pardon guilt by answer'd prayer. 7. Alternate Supplications. “O Christ, hear us. Lord, have mercy upon us.” —Prayer Book. Singer of Zion! on whose harp there hung Tones which inspired some dying martyr-tongue, Now would our sorrowing Mother's prayer of sighs, Wing'd on thy words, exclaim, “Help, Lord, arise!” Pallid, and pensive, Mary-like in woe, That Cross beneath, whence consolations flow, Meekly to God she lifts her asking gaze, Which seems to brighten with celestial rays. Lord of the Church! as Thine uplifted Arm Scatter'd of old the wounded Dragon's Is. li. 9. harm, Awake! awake! put on Thy strength, and prove The deathless valour of redeeming Love. Egypt, and Canaan, sun, moon, and sea, Subdued by miracle, or, awed by Thee, Yielded their vassal-powers, and changed their laws To aid Thy people, and promote their Cause. And, art Thou not Eternal, and the Same? And bear we not Thy sacramental Name,— Baptised Matt. xxviii. 19 (compared with). for ever into Thee, and Thine, Bone of Thy bone, Eph. v. 30. by mystery divine? Nor bonds, nor banishment, nor rack, nor ire, The sworded despot, or the seven-fold fire, Fraud, force, or falsehood, have prevail'd, O Lord, To cloud her glory, or conceal Thy word. The blood of Martyrs proved the Church's seed, And show'd her noblest, in the hour of need; While pangs enrich'd the radiance of her crown, And life was grandest, when she laid it down. Hence, to her homeless exile, Truth can bring Chants learnt from Christ, Whose life was suffering, And Litanies so deep, that Angels own Earth teaches heaven Eph. iii. 10. by some mysterious tone. And, when those sorrows, cloister'd in the heart In which the rude cold stranger hath no part, Sighless and speechless, are unveil'd to Thee, Incarnate Lord of man's eternity,— High o'er yon heavens ascends the soaring prayer, Wafted beyond adoring Seraphs there, And in Thine Attributes divinely-lost Trembles round Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! Grace to Sanctify Troubles. “Strengthen such as do stand; comfort and help the weak-hearted.” —Prayer Book. A viewless breeze, on vagrant wing, That like an air-bird loves to sing, Or, wavelet laughing in the wind, Are types of Youth's unthoughtful mind, Hither and thither, with impulsive glee Careering onward, where it wills to be. But, soon will dawn a deeper hour; And cool Reflection's calming power O'er such delirium shed a ray Which bids the heedless spirit pray, While sin and sorrow to the inner Man Preach the sad lore their blent experience can! And, what is Man?—a pulse and breath Which flutter into fleetest death; Infirmer than the faintest thing A harp of Sentiment can sing, And, ever finding, like a sea of waves, This broad earth cover'd with increasing graves! “Pity and spare” the vile and weak,— Such are the tones Thy Children speak: In mis'ry, sin, and punishment Our minute-lives are almost spent; And thus we realise, O Father-God! A blighted destiny beneath Thy rod. In “trouble,” be Thou all our Trust, Rememb'ring, Man is feeble dust; Deal gently with the Mind deprest, That faith may learn this wisdom blest,— Afflictions are the mystic overflow, Dropt on the Church, from Christ's dread Cup of woe. And thus, if shaded life appears To sadden, with evolving years, While fast decaying, one by one, The darlings of the Soul are gone,— Still may we nestle, with confiding art, Closer and closer to Emanuel's heart. From pureness, comes divinest peace; From holiness, the heart's release; And in that boundless word, “forgiven,” Are tones by grace attuned for heaven: And God is ours, if we in God confide, And stand erect, though Worlds should draw aside. 'Tis not, when fav'ring smiles alone Fall richly from Thy radiant Throne, Elected-spirits love to fall Low in the dust, and Abba! call:— Not what Thou giv'st, but what Thou art, they love, Whose graces ripen for the Realms above. Hence, “evermore” and “evermore” Children of Light their God adore; And deepen'd holiness desire, Though graven by affliction's fire:— For, Christ and Cross must in communion be, If from the First man seeks eternity. PRAYERS AND THANKSGIVINGS, UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. For Rain. “Send us, we beseech Thee,—moderate rain and showers. —Prayer Book. Nature is christian to a christian eye, Touch'd by regen'rate spells, from Christ which came, When vast creation, from His farewell-sigh, Felt a new life o'ersteal its giant frame;— Since Nature's glories, through Man's primal sin, Darken'd without, when Adam quail'd within. Gen. iii. 10. Hence Nature, Providence, and Grace combine, Wheel within wheel, Ezek. i 10. their interblending powers, And, by their threefold action form a shrine, Where Christ is worshipp'd in memorial-hours:— Creation and the Church can thus declare, Each unto each, the life and law of Prayer. And Thou, Who art the Cause of causes all, King of the Universe, by God encrown'd! Thy mercy freshens, through each rain-drop's fall, The fruit and verdure of the fragrant ground; While, o'er the clouds adoring hearts ascend, And, shrined in glory, hail the sinner's Friend. Deluge and drought, the sunshine, dew, or rain Are not contingencies, but full of God; Each hath a mission, and the wisest gain Lessons from all, when Science walks abroad, Perusing Nature with religious eye,— Divinely-conscious that her Lord is nigh. But, if in showers man's atheistic heart Forget the Fount, whence raining mercies flow, Who does not dread Thee, when the clouds depart And landscapes wither in a torrid glow, Till earth seem iron, and the heaven like brass;— Is there a Curse that can such doom surpass? Then, parch'd and pining, droop all fruits and trees, The meadows burn beneath a blasting glare, While Nature sickens for the absent breeze, And Life seems gasping in the pulseless air: Creation dons the livery of death, And dying Languor draws its heated breath. Lord of the atmosphere! in mercy look Down on our Land, if thus chastised it be, And once again bid every flowing brook, In liquid warbles to resound of Thee: While balm and beauty, as thy People pray, With answ'ring freshness field and grove array. And, bounteous Heaven! beneath Thy fruitful Word Let barren souls be soften'd, and subdued, Till each dead feeling, by devotion stirr'd, Bound with new throbs of holy gratitude,— Learning that wisdom heaven-taught spirits gain, When God is reverenced in the gift of rain. For Fair Weather. “Send us such weather, as that we may receive the fruits of the earth, in due season.” —Prayer Book. Inspired by Angels seems the hallow'd air Chrysost. vol. ii. par. ii. p. 530. Of christian Temples, in some hour of prayer, When bow'd adorers, meek and lowly, With litanies, heart-deep as holy, And plaintive accents of melodious love, Mingle their Altar-chants with martyr-cries Rev. vi. 9, 10. above. But, when pure tears, in penitential flow, Gush from the heart for sin-avenging woe, Angelic watchers hover nigh And listen to each low-breath'd sigh, Grieved when we sink, or gladden'd when we soar, And love those Spirits most, who most their God adore. Thus, not alone, pale Mother, art Thou, now, Lifting to heaven thy supplicating brow,— That He, Whose everlasting Throne “The Lord sitteth upon the flood.” —Ps. xxix. 10. O'erawes the water-floods alone, His olive-bearing Dove may gently send, To signify, stern wrath may in soft mercy end. Almighty! when Thy whelming torrents fall, Palsied with guilt, our craven minds recall That Gen. viii. 21. unrepeated judgment-hour When shrieking Earth beheld Thy power,— The drowning Carcase of a deluged world, Sunk in sepulchral waves, by justice o'er it hurl'd! But still, Thy Sacramental Bow could shine And symbolise thy grace by hues divine, Lord of the Sea! Whose Ark did save Elect ones from the billow's grave,— Types of true souls hereafter, who should be Kept Rev. iii. 20, 21. in Thy Holy church, baptismally by Thee. And therefore, let Thy lurid clouds withdraw; Green make the soil, as that which Noah saw When from his Ark the Patriarch went, And, 'neath the sun-clad firmament, In dripping brightness from departed rain Watch'd the deliver'd Earth in verdure bloom again. All weather bears Thy Will's resistless form, Typed in the calm, or tokened by the storm; But, in the mild and mellow spring Love hears a Promise murmuring, In mystic echoes, which can never cloy,— Sure as yon rainbow Gen. ix. 13. smiles, no Deluge shall destroy “The earth; but, summer, heat and harvest, shall My Name and Nature unto faith recall:”— So be it, Lord! and thus, from Thee Both in Thy wrath, and clemency, Our conscience, lesson'd by Almighty lore, Creation in the Cross shall study, more and more. Since, what is Nature, but a realm divine, Where, in dread secresy, as in a shrine, Father, and Son, and Spirit are In everything, and everywhere, Life, Law and Energy, See Ambrose in Comber. Rev. vol. ii. p. 316.—a Trinitarian soul Creatively August. Epist. iv. 169. at work, to harmonise the Whole. And, blest the Church, with more than Science fraught, Who all her Children has sublimely taught, What carnal tongues mere “nature” call, Interprets God, the ruling All, Since not a pulse, or principle of life, With hidden Deity that is not sway'd, and rife. And if that Lord, Who cloth'd a field-born flower With more than glory, in its regal hour, Shall sanctify each pensive look We cast upon Creation's book,— Then, fruit and verdure, rain and sunshine, may Whisper through Nature's walks,—“Here, let us muse, and pray.” Dearth and Famine. “Grant that the scarcity and dearth which we do now most justly suffer, for our iniquity, may through Thy goodness, be mercifully turned into cheapness and plenty.” —Prayer Book. Some broken whispers of The Name Divine Float through this fallen world of ours, But, Conscience cannot into words combine, Or, explicate, with all her powers, What mean those whispers, when The Law is nigh, And thunders, “pay me!” or, a bankrupt, die! Oft, when Affliction's more than midnight-pall Enwraps our destiny below, Or, sight and sound forgotten crimes recall, As imaged by judicial woe,— From the dread heart of deep Eternity, Comes Vengeance, clad with direst mystery! Searching and sounding Thought's unpierced abyss When Science gropes its way to God, Who, by a mental path, perplexed like this, The ground of sainted virtue trod?— Alas, for Cain-like spirits! Gen. iv. 3. who can dare To find in reason, what must flow from prayer. They stumble on, for ever, more and more, In dimness, doubt, and secret dread, Who will not God Himself in Christ adore, And are not by His Spirit led; Their church, Self-will, their Decalogue the same,— How can such heathens bear the Christian name? O! timely meek, and thus, made truly wise, Child of the Church, Lord, let me live; Anoint by faith our spirit's inward eyes, And in Thy word those comforts give Which neither blast, nor blight, nor famines reach, Where'er they echo what Thy warnings teach! Eden of Isles, though blissful England be, Glory and Garden of all lands, 'Tis only while her children worship Thee, Round her green clime that grace expands From whence our wave-rock'd paradise can smile, And prove, O Lord! Thy consecrated Isle. The boundless Universe is but thy slave, Ps. cxix. 91. Its Faculties Thy vassals are; And in the womb, as in the whelming grave, Both life and death obey Thee, there; Famine and food alike from Thee descend, By Wisdom fitted for some moral end. Whether from rainless cloud, or cruel war, The with'ring scourge of Scarceness come, Truth sees in all those miseries that mar The peace, and preciousness of home, Not second Causes!—to the FIRST we soar, Who holds creation's granaries in store. Famine and dearth, dread God! Thy vengeance sent, On Canaan's realm, and Egypt's clime; When, curs'd by Thee, the parchèd firmament Refused the rain, in fair spring-time: 'Twas thus of old, Thy penal frowns did fall, And back the godless unto Heaven recall. But from thy lips, O lion-hearted Seer! Samaria's cry for mercy rose; And, hark! on prostrate Ahab's ear, The answering rain-flood quickly flows:— E'en while he prays, the blacken'd clouds dispart, And all their freshness in full shower impart! But, Thou art still the ever-changeless God, Whose heaven Elijah ope'd by prayer, And, while we tremble at Thy Judgment-rod, Receive our Litanies, and “spare” Thy punish'd ones, who in this trial-hour, Adore Thy Goodness, while they dread Thy power. Giver of food! Thou art Almighty Bread, John vi. 35. The Manna of immortal souls, Deprived of Whom, the living are the dead, Whatever fate such life controls; Celestial nutriment our spirits need, And Christ is He, on Whom disciples feed. Whatever dearth these famish'd bodies feel, Food of the Soul! if Thou be nigh Thy Saints will bear it with heroic zeal, And greet the death 'tis gain Phil. i. 31. to die, For all who crucify the flesh-born will And drink the Matt. xx. 22. Cup which Christ has deign'd to fill. War and Tumults. “King of all Kings, and Governor of all things—save and deliver us, we humbly beseech Thee, from the hands of our enemies.” —Prayer Book. Dead Empires, sepulchred in graves of Time, Proud Hist'ry mantles with a pall sublime; But, underneath that shroud repose What buried crimes, and hidden woes!— King of kings! and Lord of Lords, By Thine Own omniscient words Embruted minds instruct this royal Truth to know,— Empires, as well as souls, to Thee their safety owe. Wafted and winged by supernat'ral love Soars the ascending heart of Prayer above, And, entering through yon veilèd Heb. vi. 19. Shrine, Visions within Thy Hands Divine Church, and Country's mingled cause, Freedom, Faith and holy Laws, Thou Lover of all souls! in Whose true light men see, A kingdom's master-stength is christian purity. Those passion-roots of desolating War, Which germinate in havoc, fierce and far, What are they, but a brood of Sin, Sprung from a bosom-hell within?— Pride and envy, lust of power, Form the fiends which thus devour All principles of Peace a God Incarnate came To purchase by His pangs, and hallow by His Name. What is false “glory,”—save a guilt disguised, A murd'rous cheat, magnificently prized, When rifled home and ruin'd shrine With all the curse of war combine, And the shrieks of Womanhood Heard in harrowing solitude,— Throng round the gory track, where Armies fought, or fled, And crushing war-steeds stamp'd their hoofs upon the dead. Go, when the rush and roar of Fight are past And pallid moonbeams on the slain are cast, Go, muse around the mangled heap Who there in welt'ring havoc sleep,— Youth and Manhood, as they fell, Far from home, and loved so well!— And, while you heave a sigh o'er many a sunken brow, Think what their spirits feel, whose flesh lies mould'ring, now! Blest Teacher! who unteachest pride to Man, In perfect harmony with God's own plan, Mother of Saints! thy meekness bring, When War and Faction round us ring Yells of fierceness, which betray Passions in their fiendish play, Come, with thy gentleness, celestial as refined, And let our struggle be,—who most shall love mankind! Blest Jesu! in Thy Unity repose All healing remedies for war, and woes: Discord, and Strife, and reinless Will, Calm'd by Thy chastening word, are still; Halcyon-dreams of holy bliss, Vile Ambition's hope dismiss, And ploughshares into swords transformed by Grace will be, When Heroes are the Saints, whose souls resemble Thee. Yet, Lord of Hosts! if blood and battle come And weapon'd Patriots fight for hearth and home, While tented field, and bivouac, The trumpet, steed, and victor-track, Soldiers of the World delight Who for crowns of conquest fight, The prowess of the Church will prove, by ceaseless prayer, As Joshua did of old,—true victory is, there! Ah! who can tell how oft the Child of God In saintly paths by tranquil Virtue trod, While Earth's loud clarions falsely claim A vict'ry in some earth-god's name, Dreaming martial courage can Be a Providence to Man,— High o'er the heaven of faith by secret prayer hath soar'd, And from Jehovah gained the blessing thus implored. Thy Saints, oh Lord! true soldiers are, Baptised for conflict, and ordained to war,— But, that is fought the soul within, Where grace subdues each hostile sin.— Teach them, Saviour! thus to be Victors who contend for Thee, And, vanquish by that Truth, which gains the World's release, Whose perfect Hero is the Prince of Holy Peace. Plague or Sickness. “Have pity upon us, miserable sinners, who are now visited with great sickness and mortality.” —Prayer Book. Almighty! in the midnight of Thy frown Myriads are wither'd down:— Walking in darkness, like a curtain'd Fiend In power and presence screen'd, Moves round our land a desolating Pest No mortal cures arrest; Since, onward, in its blast and blight of death, Sweeps His contagious breath! Tremendous art Thou, sin-avenging God! When thus Thy penal rod Is darkly wielded o'er an Empire's sin, While guilt's own lash within Harrows the conscience with a secret scourge, As Past and Present urge Home on the heart, what Priest, and Seer declares,— Thy People are not “spared” See Collect. When truths are yielded to Rebellion's cries, And faith in goodness dies, Till loyalty from Church and Crown departs, And Treason in base hearts Fosters each faction proud Self-will approves, And mad Opinion loves,— To hail the Korahs, whose schismatic joy Reels in the word—“Destroy!” Guardian of Holiness! Thy frowns descend On all who thus offend: Plague, Pestilence, and Death, those awful Three! So eloquent of Thee, Proclaim Thy justice, and our guilt display Clear as the Judgment-day;— For, though from man dread Judgments oft arise, Yet faith Thy rod descries. When cureless Pestilence, with scorching blast O'er hearts and homes hath past, Then, pangs are preachers; and our graves reveal Truths which the sternest feel.— And grant, O Lord! in such deep hour of dread Thine Own elect be led, For punishment to find a moral cause Which indicates Thy laws. Incarnate Healer of the sin-plagued heart! Thy Paraclete impart; E'en as of old, the sworded 2 Sam. xxiv. 16. Angel-hand Once paused at Thy command, So, bid the terrible Inflictor now Relax His deathful brow, And in the mercy of thy pardoning word Sheathe the Almighty sword! Such precedents inspire the Church's prayer, And seeds of promise are: Atoned by David, if Thy People found Their Lord with blessing crown'd,— Not less, Jehovah! shall baptised ones see Some token-smiles of Thee, Gleaming around them with irradiant love Fresh from Thy Face above. The Ember Week.—First Collect. “Guide and govern the minds of Thy servants, the Bishops and Pastors of Thy flock.” —Prayer Book. Mysterious purchase of Almighty Blood! Acts xx. 28. Who, based on God's eternity, hast stood Unchang'd in essence, since Emanuel's time, High o'er all hate, by miracle sublime,— We pray for Thee! Church of the Lord! catholical and one, Neither by Power, nor Policy begun, No mere creation, framed by mortal will, In sacramental might enduring still,— We pray for Thee! From everlasting in the Heart Divine Prov. viii. 23. Bride of th' Incarnate! was Thine awful shrine; Loved by The Trinity, Whose counsels gave All which mankind can sanctify, or save,— We pray for Thee! Here, in this creedless world of Woe and sin Tempted without, and sorely tried within, Hated, yet fear'd, while faction, scorn, and strife Blend and combine to counterwork Thy life,— We pray for Thee! Long may these Ember-fasts intensely prove A perfect witness of primeval Love, Whose dateless birth in Time's religious past Hath round their claims a consecration cast,— We pray for Thee! Thy priested Applicants of purchased grace, Stewards of Christ, who back their Office trace E'en to The Lord, from Whom it first began,— Priest of all priests, th' ordaining Son of Man!— We pray for them! Counsel and comfort, guardian-love, and light, In the true meekness of anointed Might, Heroic purity, and hallow'd power To baffle Fiends in their most fearful hour,— We pray for them! And Ye! Successors by celestial law To that Episcopate Apostles saw, With links unbroken handing down the Chain That binds the Present with the Past again,— We pray for You! Pastors for Christ! that on no impious head The spell of consecrating Hands be shed, But with all wisdom, faith, and watching care Deacon and Priest may binding vows declare,— We pray for You! Guard them, and guide them, Bishop of all Souls! Whose living Unction heart and will controls; That, in the plenitude of each high gift, The Church may ever Thy true Cross uplift,— And pray John xvii. 9. for them! Here, while our low-breathed Litanies ascend, Enter the Veil, and with hosannahs blend Which deepen round Thy saint-encircled Throne, Prov. xiv. 3. Pardon Thy people, who are called Thine Own,— And pray for them! Shelter'd, and screen'd within Christ's ancient Fold, Still may Thy Pastors, Sheep and Lambs behold; And that Chief Shepherd endless worship give Who died on earth, that man in heaven might live,— For this we pray! The Ember Week.—Second Collect. Replenish them with the truth of Thy doctrine, and endue them with innocency of life.” —Prayer Book. Wisdom divine, o'er-mast'ring Ps. lxxvi. 10. mortal sin!— Here is true Hist'ry, when our souls begin In Providence, by faith unroll'd, More than man's will to there behold; And, while maintaining that our choice is free, High o'er all human strife, discerns Theocracy. Taught by that science which Thy Word illumes, Thus can a Saint disperse those deepening glooms, Which oft around Christ's home John xiv. 23. below Have darken'd with mysterious woe, And seem, to sense, as though Destruction came To banish from the earth the Brightness of Thy name! Oh! blessed thought, that with almighty spell, Circles the Church His first-born prize so well,— “Head over all Things” is that Love Incarnate, on God's Throne above, Beneath Whose will Eternity and Time In full subjection bow, to aid His Cause sublime! Bestower of all gifts, supremely-good, Hence on Thy promise hath for ages stood Thine order'd Church, where Truth and Grace Regenerate our fallen race,— Above mutation, policy, and all The Antichrists of earth “a sure progression” call! And now, while Apostolic gifts descend As Priest and Levite round the Altar bend, Mysterious Unction, Love, and Light, To guide and govern each aright,— Communicate to them, O Christ! we pray, And in each heart enshrine Thy Paraclete, to day. In just gradation of a Threefold Line, See Ordination Service. Are those pure Orders, faith reveres as Thine, Which through successive links referr'd, We backward trace to that high Word, Firm as God's throne, and like His promise, true,— “As Me the Father sent, mine Heralds, send I you!” And thus, anointed Almoners for heaven! To whom, by sacramental law, are given Most awful Powers, for Christ to wield, Albeit in simple rites conceal'd,— Yours may the Everlasting Urim be, And in consistent lives, may Love her Thummim see. Deut. xxxiii. 8. Replenish'd by heaven's radiant truth within, And sanctified beyond prevailing sin, Ambassadors! now speed ye forth From east to west, and south and north, In earthen vessels holding Treasures, far Transcending jewell'd mines, which in creation are! Grace is the master-gift of Love profound, Peerless bestowal by the Godhead crown'd:— Without it, each prophetic Gift Will, Satan-like, the soul uplift; And what in Pulpit noblest sermons preach, The language of bad Life will sinfully unteach! 'Tis by a soul of purity and prayer Lord of the Church! true Priests anointed are: And, little heed such, where they hie, If guarded by That sleepless Eye, Within Whose beams of overwatching love Saints are secure below, as Seraphin above. Collect for Pardon. “Let the pitifulness of Thy great mercy loose us.” —Prayer Book. Bound and bleeding in that chain Whose links are made of misery, Rise our sunken hearts again For heaven-born light, and liberty,— To Thee, the sole Relief of spirits all Who mourn for guilt, and Christ their Master call. Not for weal, or wealth, we ask, Or sigh for what mere worldlings seek; While we bear Life's daily task Our 2 Cor. xii. 10. strength is found in being weak,— Strong in Thy grace, but weak, whene'er we trust On human Pillars, which are based in dust! Yet, a ransom, Lord! we crave, Transcending all terrestrial gift, E'en thy Sympathies!—which save And up to Thee ourselves uplift:— Home of the heart! and centre of each soul, Heavenward attract us by such blest control. In Thy Name deep glories dwell, Whose nature 1 John iv. 8. is forgiving love; Mercies more than numbers tell, Hover round Thy Throne above, And wing their flight to this low world of care, In wafted answer to the Church's prayer. Thus, in that mysterious hour When oft some bosom-weight of sin, Burdens with a crushing power Exalted thoughts which soar within, Celestial Ransomer! unbind the chain, Till holy Freedom shall the heart regain. Not in sickness, gloom, or grief, Disciples of the Cross can see That which most demands relief Besought from prayer-moved Deity: For, christian sorrows lose their earth-made stings, And, touch'd by faith, are turned to glorious things! But thy people, Lord of Glory! To Thee and Thine betroth'd Hos. ii. 19. for ever, When they bow in prayer before Thee,— From all corruptions which can sever Souls from Thyself, internal ransom seek, And sacred Vengeance 2 Cor. vii. 11. on their errors wreak! Pardon'd guilt will not alone Capacitate the heart for bliss; Purity must lend a tone Before we reach a state like this; Since, hell exists in nature, more than space,— And is not heaven begun by inward grace? Kingly Heart, and holy Mind, Heroic Saints by hist'ry throned, Who have most adorn'd mankind In life and death, this doctrine own'd,— Meetness for God from Christ's true merit flows, And none reach heaven, in whom nought heaven-like glows: Thou, whose property is Love, On Thee we fix our lifted eyes, Yearning for that Scene above, Which dawn'd on David's visioned eyes,— The coronation of the Holy Ghost, Glory of feasts!—the final Pentecost! Prayer for Parliament. “We humbly beseech Thee, as for this kingdom in general, so especially for the High Court of Parliament.” —Prayer Book. The captive Exile, Jerem. xxix. 7. far from Judah's clime Weeping alone by Babel's willow'd streams, Must oft have pondered o'er Youth's golden prime, When Fancy revell'd in her fairy dreams, On vine-clad hills, or by that haunted Sea Whose blue waves fringe the shores of Galilee. Yet, nothing stern that songless Ps. cxxxvii. 4. moment pain'd, No angry shadows round each home-dream fell, For, high o'er Wrong, this hallow'd doctrine reign'd,— He conquers woe, who can endure it well! Thus, truly meek, Faith spread her fetter'd hands, Lifted in prayer for peace on hostile lands. And, when the racking fires of Pagan Rome Rent young disciples, limb by limb, to death, Ere tortured Virtue soar'd to Jesu's home In bleeding glory, and on martyr-breath, Still, for the Commonwealth the Churches prayed, And Christ's own Spirit parting souls array'd. Luke xxiii 34 But, if for Governments, whose impious wrong Convulsed the heart of Liberty, and Truth, And crush'd the Right with vengeance stern, and strong, Making a holocaust of Age and Youth— See Tertullian. &amp;c. If for such Empire, temple-prayer ascended, That heathen-law might be by Heaven defended, No lagging spirit of reluctant vows For this high Kingdom in the faith, shall rise! But, bearing on our consecrated brows The Sign baptismal, let us scale the skies With soaring prayer, and seek celestial Light To guide Britannia in her course, aright. Lord of all Lands! to us a peerless Isle, An ancient Ark of Liberty and Laws By Thee is granted; and Thy guardian-smile Has ever brighten'd round her perill'd cause, Where Church and State make one incorp'rate Whole, And both are balanced by a wise control. Thus, do we supplicate, with soul intense, Wisdom on high, to strengthen Church, and State, And find in Deity that true defence Which forms the good, and sanctifies the great, And prompts his heart, where'er the Pilgrim roams, Here to behold a paradise of homes! Religion is the golden chain which binds All warring powers and principles, in one, Where meets the lowest, with the loftiest, mind, Round that deep Centre, whence all Laws begun— The Will Divine, by which true Kings alone Can wield a Sceptre, or sustain a Throne. Supreme of Councillors! Thou Saviour-God, Wise by thy wisdom, let true Patriots learn To tread those path-ways heaven-taught Sages trod, And England's glory in Thy Grace discern: So, shall Thy words her sacred watchmen be, And Britain prosper, when approved by Thee. For Rain. “Send us, we beseech Thee—moderate rain and showers.” —Prayer Book. Hark! how the rain-drops with a silv'ry tone Are on the languid flowers and fruits descending, While balmy freshness, from the fields new-mown, With sudden bloom seems all the landscape blending. And a green radiance from reviving grass Sparkles, when swift the breezy air-wings pass. A Hand Almighty, in a viewless course, Hath softly glided o'er the teeming ground, And summoned into beauteous life and force Creative energies, which there abound:— From the mean insect, to you mighty Sun, A new enchantment is from God begun! Again the conscious brooks their anthems sing, And wild bees hum within the blossom'd flower, While young birds quiver on ecstatic wing And sweetly carol o'er this rain-bright hour: Around, beneath, one rich expanse of bloom Hides from the heart, that earth contains a tomb! O! blessed answer to a church-breath'd prayer When mercy-showers descend with stealing fall, That parch'd creation and the pulseless air Their genial freshness may for man recall; While, crown'd with plenty, glorious Harvest tells The Lord is working with His myriad spells! Nature in God, and God in Nature, too,— Here is the creed which heaven-taught Science learns; All veiled causation ever gazing through, Religion greets Him, and her Lord discerns In the bright rain-gems which impearl the land, Or, when the storm-clouds round His throne expand. And, eyeless are we, more than blind and base, Victims of flesh, enthrall'd with vilest power,— Divinity if thus we dread to trace Nor see Heaven smiling through this gracious hour, Since the dark heathens could their Rain-gods own, And gave to Altars a memorial-tone. Thou teaching Mother! in thy lore of Love All nature proves a christian shrine to thee, One vast cathedral, arch'd by skies above, Where Saints and Angels blend their liturgy,— Each, in due order, working out the plan, Creation Heb. i. 14. ministers from God to Man. Lord of my Soul! when rain and sunbeams send Tokens of Thee, through forest, glade, or field, Let Faith her anthems with Thy mercy blend And worship Christ, in His own world reveal'd: Where men see “Nature,” in a second cause, She finds a Presence, which the soul o'erawes! And grant, that on the prayerless minds of those Who feel the with'ring blast of unbelief, Thy spirit-dews, by which Devotion grows, May drop, like latter rains that bring relief; Till fruitless hearts, by fresh'ning grace restored, Shall bloom with holiness, and bless The Lord. For Fair Weather. “Who in Thy mercy has comforted our souls by this seasonable and blessed change of weather.” —Prayer Book. The primal Altar was a shrine of praise Erected on the sod, When rescued Noah, with adoring gaze, Forth from the Ark of God Came at command,—and saw the world around In deathful slumber bound, But still, deliver'd from that penal flood Whose waves of awful ire above the mountains stood! In dripping brightness greenly shone the earth Where golden sun-gleams smiled; As if Creation, like a second birth, No more by sin defiled,— Fresh from the cradle of dread waters rose, And, safe from future woes, Renew'd that radiance her young features wore When Adam's priestly heart did first his God adore. And, ever may this virgin-altar preach Sermons of holy love, To that true Church, whom vaster mercies reach Than Noah saw above, When the calm Gen. ix. 13. Bow with curving beauty spread A symbol o'er his head:— For, what it preach'd, our Ark of grace enshrines In sacramental depths, where Love with Life combines. Fair weather from the fresh'ning North proceeds; Job xxxvii. 11. But, in these changes all, When climate brings to man's perpetual needs What men “fair weather” call, The pure expressions of His perfect will Creation-laws fulfill, Whether by blast, or breeze, in cloud, or sun,— Whom Saints and Angels crown the God-revealing One! Now, while the howling blasts lie hush'd and still, The blazonry of storms No longer darkens o'er the cloud-veiled hills In fierce and thund'rous forms; The whirlwinds fold their tossing plumes to rest; And ocean's waveless breast Mirrors the sunbeam, whose incessant play Breaks o'er the dimpling tide, which heaven's soft hues array. God of fair Weather! hymns to Thee we lift O Thou! That hearest prayer, From Whom descends each atmospheric gift Thy lauding People share; The plague of waters might we justly meet,— But, on the Mercy-seat Reigns that Incarnate Priest, to Whom we pray, Under Whose calming gaze all tempests clear away. And thus, an omnipresent Gospel dwells, In symbol, or in sign, Through vast creation, whose material spells Image the Cross divine,— Each, by mute eloquence, proclaiming Him Whom Souls and Seraphim With blended unity of praise adore, And in Whose heart are shrined all blessings now in store. The hush of Nature is a holy thing, A calm which hath a Creed: For, e'en as Tempests unto conscience bring Mem'ries which make it bleed, Typing the guilt these storm-clouds well present That shade the firmament,— So, in the balm and beauty of bright weather, Christ and Creation seem by Mercy brought together. Lyre of the heart! let all thy chorded praise Vibrate with lauding zeal; And unto Him, Devotion, lift thy gaze In Whom all gifts reveal A pardon infinite, by anguish gain'd Upon the Cross blood-stained, When He hung there, between the earth and sky, While Heaven look down amazed, to see her Maker die! Hence, awful are our mercies! bleeding Lord, When each by Scripture read, Since they are mottoed by a mystic word Which speaks,—“Thy Saviour bled!” Bled to redeem what guilt to ruin gave, And none prevailed to save, But Love Incarnate, in Whose Person met Merit and Manhood both, to pay sin's boundless debt! And, e'en as Aaron on his raiment wore Mysterious Bells, whose tone Sounded, whene'er he went his God before Under the mercy-throne,— So, for each gift let Faith her harp prepare And laud Him ev'rywhere, On Whose vast merit hangs Creation's whole, Not less the Lord of earth, than Saviour of the soul! For Plenty. “Continue Thy loving-kindness unto us, that our land may yield us her fruits.” —Prayer Book. While the breezy woodlands sing And the ripen'd corn-fields bring Bending harvests, rich and rare, Seek we, Lord, the Shrine of prayer. What is Growth, in fruit, or field, All which golden summers yield,— But indeed a sacred Birth Preaching God through all the earth! Acts xiv. 17. Verdant haunts, and vine-clad hills, Freshness which the landscape fills, Each can tune the harp of thought Waking tones with wonder fraught,— Wonder, that a sin-born race Still behold Thy mercy-Face Beaming down such radiant bliss On a world depraved as this! Did the foodless soil remain Scorch'd by heat, or drench'd by rain, Were our flocks and herds to fail, And a famish'd Empire's wail Heard to pierce yon deafen'd skies,— Could we dare uplift our eyes, Nor in all, pure Justice see Vindicating Truth, and Thee? But in Christ, reveal'd Thou art Pouring with paternal Heart Peace and plenty, far and wide Rich as Canaan's seer descried. Eden of the Ocean, smiles Thus our Queen of sceptred Isles, Fair and fruitful, free and bold, Such as poet-dreams behold! Fountains, lakes, and lovely dells, Woods and groves, with haunting spells, Garden-slope and winding glade,— Lord! in each hast Thou display'd Signs and symbols, that Thy hand Hath adorn'd our wave-girt Land With high gifts of heavenly power, Linking Thee with scene, and hour. To the Giver in His gift Lauding worship thus we lift,— Looking through each veil that lies On each charm Thy grace supplies. Let our soaring hearts ascend, And their anthem'd praises blend With Heaven's orchestra on high, Echo'd through eternity! Might the vast creation feel What Thy words to us reveal, Matter then, as well as Mind, Would adore Thee, with mankind. Living Christ of holy love! Waft pure wisdom from above, Faith, and feeling,—all which can Raise and rescue sunken Man. Lost in Self, but saved in Thee, Let our bright'ning spirits be Ever growing, more and more, Like the Lord Whom they adore. For Peace and Deliverance. “All the world may know that Thou art our Saviour and mighty Deliverer.” —Prayer Book. But late, was heard the battle-roar In boding echoes round the shore, Peal after peal in hollow thunder telling Tales of dread conflict, blood and death, Which paled the cheek, and check'd the breath, In many a widow'd Heart, and wasted dwelling! Now, Heaven has sent benign release; And in the balm of blessed peace A christian Empire is profoundly learning, That God the only Giver is Of public, as of private, bliss,— Though seldom thank'd by spirits undiscerning! Oh! taught by Grace, and truly-wise, Their spirit which in all descries The hand of Goodness, and the heart of God:— Such, everywhere His guidance feel, Who fans within their fainting zeal And bears them onward o'er Life's bleakest road. O Thou! Who wert a Rock and Tower, A Fortress in some fearful hour When cannon-thunders round the ranks were rolling,— Now, while amid the sad repose Which many a tomb-shade o'er us throws, Knells for the dead from solemn fanes are tolling, Salvation's “Captain!” on Thy battle-Throne We laud Thee,—as that Power alone High o'er the clouds of savage war presiding: Helmet and hawberk, sword and shield No shelter from the havoc yield, Except Thy Hand heroic souls be guiding. When, buried in the Red Sea-wave, The Host of Egypt found a grave, While marching Israel saw a billow-wall On either side each warrior stand, As on they move o'er waveless land, Guided by miracle which guarded all,— Moses and Miriam sang that Song Repeating time and truth prolong, Where grace and gratitude together meet; While Deborah's fierce anthem fires The soul with more than Earth inspires, As God in battle her brave numbers greet! But, were we dumb, each Pagan shrine Would thrill us into shame divine, For, in their blindness, conqu'ring Heathens praised Some god, by whose celestial arm Their hearth and home were kept from harm, And wreath'd due Altars, for their glory raised. E'en thus, when Church and State were one, See Hooker, passim. Religion graced whate'er was done Of great and glorious by an Empire's heart: Monarchs uncrown'd, to worship went, And praised the Lord Omnipotent While chanting myriads took the choral part. At Agincourt, when Vict'ry waved Old England's banner, when she braved The Gallic Charles with all his glitt'ring host,— See royal Henry gaze on high, With plumèd warriors, kneeling by, And hymn the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. But creedless men of colder days Shrink from the angel-work of praise, Nor the dread Giver in His gifts adore;— Self, sin, and sense, combine to be Their own consummate trinity, Who dream it madness to aspire for more! But Thou, Incarnate Source of truth, Guardian of age, and Guide of youth, Let pure disciples from Thy doctrine learn, Both war and peace, and all they are To consecrate by offered prayer, And with bright fervors of devotion burn. Hence, in lauding choirs of love, Lift we our chants to Christ above, From Whom descendeth earth's release, Preached in that Church, by whose true heart Infant of grace! thou wert, and art Baptised See Baptismal Service for Infancy. for battle, and prepared for peace. For Public Peace at Home. “Heavenly Father, who alone makest men to be of one mind in a house.” —Prayer Book. When Jesu walk'd the midnight-waves That foam'd, and flash'd in lightning-glare, Or, darken'd like devouring graves On sea and shipmen, tossing there, Nature obey'd her present God, And crouch'd beneath His calming Eye, As though she felt the feet which trod, Belong'd to Him, who rules the sky! But storms arise, of deeper swell, And tempests of a darker sway, Which in our mortal bosom dwell, By Law, nor Reason, lull'd away. Passion, and pride, and lust and sin, With stern emotions, fierce, or wild, All, in mad discord, mix'd within,— How often have they man defiled! And who, but He, Whose word and will The storms of Nature's realm control, Can say to spirits—Peace! be still! And calm thee down, tempestuous soul? Men wonder, how the Ark contain'd In perfect concord, brute and bird, Under a ruling spell restrain'd, And not in war and wildness stirr'd. And yet, a miracle we find Of higher range and holier law,— When home is one harmonious mind, By love becalm'd and christian awe. All hateful tempests of the heart, Which blacken there, with turbid gloom, Sooth'd by The Saviour, thence depart, And smiles of peace their reign resume. The soul is hush'd beneath the balm Till heaven seems mirror'd by its rest, As moonlight, when the waves are calm, Lies tranced upon the ocean's breast. Deliverance from Plague. “In the midst of judgment remembering mercy, hast redeemed our souls from the jaws of death.” —Prayer Book. That inward cowardice of palsied will Fainting and faltr'ing, at the word, “Be still, “Be still, and know that I am God” Though sternly fall the Judgment-rod,— The Children of the Church, O, Lord, Whose heaven is in Thy holy Word, Such cowardice, by faith's heroic spell Have wisely master'd, and resisted well. Yet, though endurance be the law of Faith, When Pestilence hath ceased a clime to scathe, Celestial hearts may sing and soar And that dread Trinity adore, Who in fierce judgment feel for Man, Pursue on high Their mercy-plan, And, while pale Empires draw contagious breath, Deliver myriads from the jaws of Death. Great God! it was indeed, Thy wrathful day When in our streets unburied corses lay, While gloom sepulchral, deep as dread, O'er hearts and homes was thickly spread, And chills of damping awe oppress'd Each pulse that play'd in Sorrow's breast, Till friends shrank frighted, if perchance, they met, As though man wonder'd, man was living, yet! But, if when sickness, fang'd with fearful pains, Rends the worn flesh, and like a Demon Mark ix. 18. reigns, And fresh-dug grave, and frequent knell, The triumphs of destruction tell, While sackcloth'd Guilt, with groaning prayer Her litany of woe declares,— When dies the Plague, and Pestilence departs, “We praise thee, God,” sing all regenerate hearts! Oh, blest revival! when the bloom and blush Of health return, and in one glowing rush Tides of enchantment seem to roll Through each glad vein, with such control That lip and limb, and heart and eyes Are touched with new-born energies, And earth and heaven that hue of glory wear That beams and brightens through some answer'd prayer. And yet, in such millennial glee of mind, Fond mem'ry cannot leave the lost behind! For blanks remain in home and heart, And sorrows deep which ne'er depart, While crowded graves, in churchyards tell, How darkly frowns Almighty fell On true affections, in their fullest power, When God descended in His judgment-hour! Thus, gladness hath a touch of holy grief To shade the brightness of our blest relief;— E'en as of old, the Temple-wall Did to each time-hoar'd Saint recall The vanished Shrine of other days Reared to Jehovah's awful praise,— So that, 'mid shouting joy, they wept and wailed, Ezra iii. 12, 13. And mirth and melancholy, by turns, prevailed. Hence, gracious Lord, this lauding hour perceives A mental shadow for the dead which grieves: Though brightning Mercy strew our path Where daily life its duty hath, Ghosts of gone joy around us float And, mingled with each mirthful note, Sighs from the deep of aching Hearts declare The lost lies buried by affection, there! Deliverance from Common Sickness. “It hath pleased Thee—to asswage the contagious sickness, and restore the voice of joy and health in our dwellings.” —Prayer Book. A faculty there seems in eye and ear, From whence pure grace and harmony are known Without it, vast creation would appear Devoid of beauty and deprived of tone. And, as Proportion gives our taste a law So, moral Sense must human action guide;— Such was the truth each wiser heathen saw Long ere the earth beheld the Crucified! But, when we view Thine everlasting Cross, Lord of this ruined world, by grace redeemed, And strive to fathom our immortal loss Had never thence atoning life-blood stream'd, Reason and conscience are alike o'ercome By such transcendencies of Love Divine; O'er the dread Scene our faith and feeling roam, And cry in wonder,—“All the Work is Thine!” And now, when sickness, with contagious ire, The blight consuming and the blast of pain Have all subsided, and our homes respire The pangless airs of perfect health again, No trains funereal through our streets are led, And dwellings, once where blinded windows told Big tears were dropping o'er some anguished bed,— Rejoicing inmates in their chambers hold. God of pure goodness! may such pard'ning love Be to our souls a ladder, whence to rise On steps of mercy, till we pause above, And worship Jesus with adoring eyes! In the bright Easter of this blessed hour Each lauding sacrifice thy Church would bring, To Thee, by gentleness, Ps. xviii. 35. and not by power Throned in the heart, as Man's Incarnate King. Prayer for all Conditions. “We humbly beseech Thee for all sorts and conditions of men.” —Prayer Book. The heart beats catholic in christian prayer Whose tones interpret what our wants declare, When soaring worship, sanctified by love, Echoes the Litanies Rev. vi. 10. and Lauds Rev. v. 9. above. The Root of Manhood is divinely One: In God we terminate, what God begun, Eccles. xii. 7. When back returns the spirit which He gave And Christ was agonised from hell to save. Such the pure brotherhood by scripture taught, With truth and tenderness most deeply fraught; While Providence by full expression seals Each unity our blood, Acts xvii. 26. and breath reveals. But in Thy Temple, Lord, may conscience learn Profounder facts than reasoning Minds discern, Who from Creation's homilies would read Those saving lessons fallen spirits need. By grace incorp'rate, with celestial span Thy Church o'erarches universal Man; For “all conditions” bends her suppliant knee, And hallows each by sacrifice to Thee. Thou art the Bond, by Whose cementing ties Ephes. iv. 19. Each sep'rate Member to the whole supplies Secrets of strength, and sympathies which glow With the deep fervours faith and heaven bestow. This be Her creed! and then, though crush'd by wrong, Yet will the Church in holiness be strong; Arm'd with high gifts, whose quenchless life within Subdues the universe, by conqu'ring sin! Mother of Saints! to God and Angels dear, Now for affliction let thy sacred tear In soothing concord with the sad arise, And speak of Sympathy beyond the skies. On Soul, and Body, and their suffering all Divine Consoler! let Thy Gilead fall,— Drops of sweet balm, that make the will resign'd, And heal the ulcers of a wounded mind. And grant, O God! adoring Bliss that prays In the bright Eden of unweeping days, May be admonish'd; and from sorrow learn Truths which the godless oft too late discern! And ye, pale Miniatures Rom. vi. 5. of Christ on earth, Poor in false wealth, yet priceless in true worth, Seek from the Church's prayer sublime relief,— Whose heart is larger than the largest grief. God of all glories! thus to Thee alone, Though veiling darkness may invest Thy Throne, Faith lifts her voice:—oh! grant some blest reply Which proves Thee “Father,” when Thy Children cry. General Thanksgiving. “We bless Thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life.” —Prayer Book. Shall lauding Angels round the Throne Unecho'd, chant their hymns alone, Nor wake on earth some answ'ring tone?— Hallelujah! glorious Lord! Bright though they are in wingèd glory, Who cast their coronets before Thee Lamb, and Light of christian story,— Hallelujah! gracious Lord! Though purer, calmer, nobler, far, Blest Angels than thy People are Who fight in flesh the spirit-war,— Hallelujah! worship'd Lord! Still, never can seraphic Heart In Thy redemption have such part As they, whose Heb. iii. 1. priested God Thou art,— Hallelujah! perfect Lord! Forgiven Saints can love Thee most, Whose guilt has felt the awful cost Of That which purchased back the Lost,— Hallelujah! dying Lord! Thus, lift we, then, our swelling laud And choral anthems pour abroad, Enrapt, sublimed, and overawed,— Hallelujah! risen Lord! Let all we have be hailèd Thine, In one vast gift of Grace divine Descending from th' Eternal Trine,— Hallelujah! reigning Lord! Eternity will ne'er recount, Or, master the untold amount Of mercies in Salvation's fount,— Hallelujah! boundless Lord! Safe in the Ark of Thy dread Hands Creation firm through Calv'ry stands, With all its host of seas and lands,— Hallelujah! saving lord! Transcendent Giver of all grace! Sole Ransomer of Adam's race, Unveil the glories of Thy Face,— Hallelujah! thronèd Lord! Let all with each, and each with all, In endless gratulation fall Low at Thy Feet, and loudly call,— Hallelujah! crownèd Lord! Life's holiness is heaven begun, Whose Root is that Incarnate One Of saints and souls the inward Sun,— Hallelujah! pleading Lord! From Sin and Self, oh! set us free, That living hymns our lives may be In time, as in eternity,— Hallelujah! All in All! THE COLLECTS, EPISTLES, AND GOSPELS. First Sunday in Advent. “Now in the time of this mortal life, in which Thy Son came to visit us in great humility.” —First Collect for Advent. Hymns rise from earth, and from the God-made Sea Ps. xcv. 5. Hosannah! cry the conscious waves to Thee, Lord of the living world! whose word Divine Decreed creation to become a Shrine. Rev. iv. 11. Sun, moon, and planet, to a priestly heart, In this vast worship take a beauteous part, While mystic cadence from each starry lyre Joins the full chorus which Thy works inspire. Ps. cxl. 5. And from that realm, where Providence for man Unfolds high purpose, and pursues each plan, And through the windings of our mortal will Rules o'er each way, but leaves it freedom, still,— Comes a true Voice, whose many-toned appeal O'er the deep conscience must divinely steal, Telling of goodness, wisdom, and the power That leads the marches of each moving Hour. But, eloquent beyond all earth-breathed voice, Sweeter than melody to minstrel-choice, Is thine, thou Mother of the Spirit-born! Heard in the quiet eve, or waking morn. Voice of the Church! through eighteen hundred years Rolling thy summons high o'er human fears, Thy deepen'd echoes, with undying play, Prolong that promise, “Heaven shall pass away But I am with you!”—Lord of Truth and Time! Thy word is certain, and our creed sublime,— That power and permanence, and peace and grace Claim Thy one Church to be their dwelling-place. Second Sunday in Advent. “With one mind and one mouth glorify God.” —Epistle for the Day. Oh, speak to Man, that Man to Thee may speak Thy sentences of calm, Spirit! from Whom the wounded and the weak Derive celestial balm: For, taught by Thee, the Church prepares, As martyr'd Cyprian's voice declares, Cyp. de Orat. Dom. Themes of pure wisdom, comfort, help, and aid, Ere Worship be with echoing words array'd. E'en the blind Jew, in Synagogues of prayer, Ponder'd, before he spoke, Stood like embodied silence there, And then, devotion broke Forth from his lips, in words which rose To that true God his fathers chose: Thus may he teach Irreverence an awe For worship deeper than the Levite saw. And, our own Mother, ere the full-voiced tide Of blending homage rolls, Her Children hath preluding tones supplied To harmonise their souls; And from that Harp of holy thought,— Scripture, with heaven's own music fraught— Borrows whate'er can soothe the awe-struck mind While God in words descends to teach mankind. With foot unsandal'd, thus the Temple seek; God dwells on holy ground! In Whose dread Courts the mighty are the meek By faith of self uncrowned: And, while the wafted chimes are pealing, From the thrilled air descends a feeling, A creed of Sentiment, which seems to say,— Heaven brightens earth, when souls begin to pray. Third Sunday in Advent. “Grant that the ministers and stewards of Thy mysteries may likewise so prepare and make ready Thy way.” —Collect for the Day. Alone God spans the gulph Luke xvi. 26. 'tween sin and God,— Then, Lord of Worlds! how far are we From that true path by sainted Martyrs trod, Whose radiance was eternity;— By nature and by act, emotion, will, and thought Each on his ruin'd soul Thy righteous Ban hath brought! Contrite and calm, yet, in the lowest dust Of piercing anguish, stern and deep, Children of guilt, with o'erawed grief we must Our sin lament, and inly weep, To think what distance lies between the soul, and Him Is. vi. 2. Around Whose glory-shrine bend wing-veil'd Seraphim. Jesu forbid! impetuous Man should dare Enter with harsh or hasty feet Temples, where God and Angels hear each prayer Offer'd before Thy mercy-seat: For, if the crystal heavens before Thee stand unclean, What but Omniscience knows, how black some hearts have been? Incarnate Mercy! ere to Thee we raise The mind, on soaring wings of speech, Oh, teach us how to introvert our gaze, And thus, the hidden conscience reach; While thrill'd devotion hears, all prayerfully intense, Those echoes of Thy Heart celestial words dispense. And, with pure wisdom's providential skill, Our ancient Mother in the Lord Doth for the soul Her teaching work fulfil By due gradations of the Word— Liturgically plann'd, to guide and govern all Who in her creeds and chants on thron'd Emanuel call. Fourth Sunday in Advent. “With great might succour us; ? through our sins and wickedness, we are sore let and hindered.” —Collect for the Day. Lord of the Church! Thy priestly word By Thee commission'd, charged, and blest,— Grant, we may hear it; and, compunction-stirr'd, Under the Cross have guilt confest. None but the damn'd should cease to pray; Crime may be hid, but not subdued; E'en now, rehearsals of the Judgment-day Enacted are, in solitude. But, might we to that dread Assize In secrecy of sin depart, Myriads of Worlds, with their concenter'd eyes, At length must read Man's open heart! In light unroll'd, and read aloud,— Who can anticipate their cry When all which earth commits of unavow'd First rolls along the list'ning Sky! Atoning Priest, triumphant Lord, Historian of the heart alone, Jeremiah xvii. 20. Prostrate beneath the radiance of Thy Word Now to the sinner let himself be shown. Confession is Thy law of grace; Without it, vain are sighs and tears; And, pardonless, oh! who can meet that Face Whose frowns are darker than our fears? Long 'ere the summon'd dead awake, Let penitence and prayer disclose Those voiceless burdens which from conscience take The calm, which Absolution knows. Wash'd into whiteness by that Blood Which streams from God's incarnate Son,— Thus only, have the Lord's elect withstood Terrors, that rise from hell begun! So hear we, then, that voice of Love Whose accents are of Cross, and Crown; And while, faith-wing'd, we soar to Christ above, Be ev'ry tower of Self cast down. Pardon is peace; but, peace retires To guiltless hearts absolved for heaven; And, he who most to purity aspires, Will find it in that word,—“forgiven.” Matthew ix. 20. Christmas Day. “The Word was made flesh.” —John i. 14. “God was manifest in the flesh.” —1 Tim. iii. 10. “In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” —Col. ii. 9. “Perfect God and perfect Man.” —Athanasian Symbol. Jehovah in our flesh array'd, Eternity in time display'd, The Virgin-born, of God the Son, The Natures, two, the Person, one, Creator, yet a Creature found, Both crucified and glory-crown'd, Oh, myst'ry dread! almighty plan Where Man is God, and God is Man.— Such Incarnation saints believe; Implicit faith, not reason, there Welcomes the truth their minds receive, And worships it, in wond'ring prayer. Hosannah! to this awful Day; And, while we hear the heaven-born lay, By hymning Angels sung on high As shepherds watch beneath the sky, Thy Church, O Lord! repeats the strain Till,—Hallelujah! rings again, And every heart becomes a lyre Whose living chords Thy gifts inspire, Who, on this solemn night did'st shake The heaven of heavens, by Advent here, And Love's eternal anthem wake To carol in the coming year. The centre and circumference Of all thy Word and Will dispense, O God! that Incarnation is From whence our glory, and our bliss.— The Root of sacramental grace That sanctifies our fallen race, Each mystery, mercy, and the plan For granting peace to pardon'd Man,— All these, and more, this Day of days When God in human Flesh was shrined, Kindle th' adoring Church with praise Whose key-note is, redeem'd Mankind. Incarnate! through Thy life and love, Already seems the Church above; “Made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (Eph. ii. 6). For, in Thy Person, where Thou art, The Members have a mystic part: With Thee they hang upon the Cross, “I am crucified with Christ” (Gal. ii. 20). With Thee endure all earthly loss, And from Thy glory-crowns of heav'n Predestined rays to them are giv'n, “There is laid up for me a crown of righteousness” (2 Tim. iv. 8). Since Thou and they incorp'rate are Combined in sacerdotal prayer,— Offer'd by one High Priest for all Who on His bleeding pangs rely, And both in life and death recall Incarnate God, Who came to die. Hosannah! Lord, and still, again Hosannah! soars the wingéd strain.— Thy Sacraments extensions are Of what Thy gifts and graces bear; And on this day, let paschal food Feed with Thy Body and Thy Blood Baptizéd myriads, who unite Their worship in that wondrous Rite, Where many grow mysterious one By the true Person of the Son, In Whom the Father's Image shines With beams of uncreated glory, Whence emanate those blessed lines In which we read Redemption's story. Saint Stephen's Day. “They stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” —Epistle of the Day. Oh! to have seen that trancéd eye Acts vii. 55. Which mirror'd an almighty Form, Descended from His Throne, on high, To welcome with embracing arm A martyr'd Saint from earth, whose soul was plum'd to soar, Bright from its bleeding clay, with garland dipt in gore. Oh! to have heard that dying breath Float heavenward from his Christ-like heart, Who, ere he fainted into death,— “Receive my spirit! where Thou art,” Cried to his risen Lord: and then, a pardon sued For those incarnate fiends, with his own blood bedew'd! Painter, and Poet, take your stand And, ere the Acts vi. 15. angel-gleams decay, Which o'er those features, pale and bland, Yet linger like a twilight-ray,— Eternalise the scene of that departing Soul, And, far as genius can, reflect the wond'rous whole. Fainter and fainter ebbs and dies The life-pulse in yon fearless man, While mission'd Angels from the skies Are learning all such Watchers can From Christ's first martyr, now, in kneeling grandeur there, Lifting to realms of Light, his pleading eyes of prayer. Wonder, and pray, but do not weep! Calm as the brow of Jesu, seem Yon features, ere they fall asleep, As though he saw some beauteous dream; And now, his last breath melts like music into heaven, With one deep sigh enton'd,—“be their dread sins forgiv'n.” Thus died he into glorious fame First of that “noble army,” Lord, Baptized in blood, for Thy dear Name, And martyr'd both by deed and word,— Leaving the Church on earth a heritage of truth Whose inspirations breathe of Apostolic youth. Such deathless Blood is eloquent, And consecrates that christian Host Whose tortures are with glory blent, And spake, with accents never lost, Of “better things” by far, than bleeding Abel's can, When crimson'd earth recoils from fratricidal man. And, ever grant, O Lord of Saints! Thy Proto-martyr pangs may be, When nerveless mind, or courage faints, Like clarions from eternity, Haranguing heart and will with superhuman power, That Heaven again may dawn on Faith's departing hour. But, what are all the petty woes Our depthless lives experience now Amid the bowers of bland repose, Where man forgets his primal vow; Or, mid the grov'lling calm of never-glorious bliss Sinks into sensual death, to gain a world like this? Yet thy confessing martyrs, Lord, Each pang and penalty foresaw, As read they, in Thine awful Word, To suffer, was a mystic law, Morn, noon, and night, to them with persecution fraught, That shaded life with death, and half its anguish wrought. So lived, so died, those hero-souls Whose death-pangs made the Church sublime; And they, whose hearts such worth controls Battle, like them, with Earth and Time, And learn from Stephen's lips, what dying prayers can be, When wafted up to heaven on words of charity. The Martyr for his murd'rers pray'd,— And well that prayer an answer found, When he, beside whose feet were laid The robes a bloody hand unbound, By miracle transform'd, in echo to that prayer, Cried, glory to the Cross! till none but Fiends despair. 1 Tim. i. 15. St. John the Evangelist's Day. “The disciple whom Jesus loved.” —Gospel for the Day. A creature on his own Creator's heart Pillow'd in peace! John xxi. 20.—oh! spectacle divine What Muse can sing how wonderful Thou art, Though David melodised the matchless line, Since God and man are so commingled there, That Poesy is awed, and trembles into prayer! Youngest of those discipled by the Lord, And His beloved, by eminence supreme,— Long as the Church can read the deathless Word, Still may her faith, in fond devotion dream, Emanuel's Heart within his Gospel beats, Where ev'ry loving word Its throb of love repeats. From that blest region, where his head reclined, Close to the spring of everlasting Grace, St. John hath utter'd, to entrance mankind, Truths which eternity will not erase,— Tones of celestial power, whose deep control Wakes into wond'ring awe the echoes of the soul. “Passing the love of woman,” chaste and pure Glows the high zeal the friend of Jesus felt; And, mild and maiden-like, his words allure The yielding hearts their heaven-toned accents melt; And yet, at times, “The Son of thunder” speaks, And lightning from the cloud of stormy language breaks! But oh! the master-spell, is love divine Born of the Breast Almighty, where he lay; And, more than Seraphim beheld, alone Our fallen world did gloriously display When said the dying Saviour to St. John, “Behold thy Mother there,—and, Mother, see thy Son!” Woman! above all women raised, and blest, From that dark scene of agony and dread As home he took thee to thy shelt'ring rest, How did he cling to what th' Incarnate said!— How did he rev'rence, with an awful bliss, And more than filial love, a dying charge like His. And if, when living, to The Lord he clung E'en like a shadow at His perill'd side, Oft o'er those words his musing fondness hung, The vestal Mother to that page supplied Which pictures Jesus, as “The Holy Child” Cradled in Virgin arms, adored, and undefiled. Yes, long as pensive souls of peace and prayer Yearn round The Cross, and near that Tomb, to be, Where blending miracles of grace declare Secrets 2 Tim. i. 9. enshrining Man's eternity,— Divinest magic round St. John will draw Saints who can witness there, with tenderness and awe, The parting radiance of Christ's earthly life.— He last beheld Him in this world of woe, Ordain'd in mercy to outlive the strife His infant Church was doom'd to face, and know, And preach, through seventy years, that saving Word Which “He, whom Jesus loved,” from Jesu's self had heard. Close to the Cross, he saw John xix. 25 and 26. the Saviour die; First to the Tomb, his holy fervour ran; And, when he view'd Him on the vision'd sky Unseal Rev. v. 50. the volume of Redemption's plan, How did his echoing heart exult to hymn The myriad-voicèd chant of choral Seraphim! And Thou, Who art of Souls the inward Sun, Here while we “tarry,” let us dwell in Thee; If soon, or late, life's destined course be run, The motto of our faith is,—“follow Me!” Not ours, but Thine, the future; dark or bright, Enough for Saints to know, Thy secret will is right. If exiled in some Patmos, sad, or lone, Our God ordain that we must live and die, Or preach, and perish, in far lands unknown, With none to calm the heart, or close the eye,— What matter, if, like John, we wait in peace, And tarry, till He comes, our Glory and Release! The Innocents' Day. “Almighty God, who madest infants to glorify Thee by their deaths.” —Collect for the Day. The meek-eyed darlings of His grace divine, Who lisp'd in martyrdom Emanuel's name,— Well may the Church their festival enshrine And crown dead Infants with celestial fame. Garlands of beauty, bathed in Jesu's Blood, Their bleeding innocence of brow adorn Who, ere they chose the evil or the good, Left weeping Rachel in her woe forlorn. Nurslings for Glory, by their God reclaim'd, Back to His Heart, their everlasting Home, By guilt unblotted, and remorse unshamed,— Welcomed in Christ, lo! sinless martyrs come. Their palms were pains, whose early suff'ring taught The future Passion of their infant Lord,— Confessing babes, by martyr-likeness wrought To mystic oneness with th' Incarnate Word. They spake by Blood, what language could not speak,— Firstlings of Grace, whose slaughter Ps. viii. 2. proved a sign How God in them could glorify the weak, And round the cradle cast a spell divine. Men gaze on childhood with unthinking glee, Or vacant sentiment, which seems no more Than laughing joyance, in its lightness, free As sun-lit wave that warbles on the shore; But, by the myst'ry of the Church embraced, Children to higher spheres of thought ascend, And on them, by no with'ring time effaced, The blood-red shadows of the Cross descend. As Christ received all children, when He took One little trembler in His arms of old, Casting on cherub-features that fond look Love's inward eye by faith may still behold,— So, in those sainted Innocents, which died Under the slaughter-ban of Herod's sword, Parents may see for ever sanctified The pangs which link all infants to the Lord. Touch'd by His Cross, ere yet by sin defiled, Myriads of Babes, at Jesu's birth, were slain, To prove, His death-pang vibrates through a child, And infant-martyrs with Confessors reign. Hence, weeping mothers in their childless woe, Learn from dead Innocence, beneath the Cross, When back to Heaven infantile spirits go,— For God to suffer, is to gain by loss. Sunday after Christmas Day. ‘We, being regenerate, and made Thy children by adoption and grace.” —Collect for the Day. Subdued by no majestic awe, Reason condemns what Seraphim adore; And, challenging celestial Law, Sternly demands, as heathen did, of yore,— “To mindless babes “Which things the angels desire to look into” (1 Pet. i. 12). “He revealed them unto babes” (Matt. xi. 35). are mystic truths reveal'd From perfect Angels by their God conceal'd?” Water, and bread, and wine, appear Bare elements, of weak and worthless sway; But, Faith's own children can revere The inward power these outward garbs array:— Mysterious forms of many-sided Grace Such types present to God's adopted race. And, Sacraments themselves enclose Such blended principles for mind, and heart, See Hooker on Sacraments. That each to moral bias owes Exclusive doctrines, which themselves impart: Duties, and bonds, and admonitions deep, Memorials, hopes, and thoughts which make us weep, All, all, to Sacraments pertain:— But chief, as tokens of The God unseen, These Rites assume their awful reign; And, in the Church have most divinely been An open witness of that secret Act Whereby the Trinity our souls attract. For grace, in essence, lies conceal'd, Which neither sense, nor carnal mind can view; But, God an index hath reveal'd Of what His sacramental Law will do, Under a type, where sealing grace is given To fit the spirit for its future heaven. And Thou, of second Birth the sign, Baptismal Font! whose consecrated wave Sprinkles the brow with dew divine, And bids it beam with light beyond the grave,— Thee may we rev'rence, when Devotion's hour From heaven derives the mystery of thy power. “God ? who didst sanctify water to the mystical washing away of Sin.” —Ministration of Infant Baptism. Soul of an infant! passive Thing, In thy young depths can no repulsion lurk, Nor can our worshipp'd Reason bring Man's aiding will, to blend with God's own work; And thus, thy second Birth we justly call Pure Act divine, where Grace does all in all. Vital, though viewless, is the germ Baptismally by Christ implanted there; Waiting, perchance, time's destined term, When, quicken'd up by penitence and prayer, God's hidden Seed will gloriously arise And flourish toward its unforgotten skies! By nameless laws, to man unknown, Water and word may with the Spirit blend, And what, as magic, men disown, Eternal Wisdom may in secret send,— Ruling the soul with Heaven's attractive sway, Till “deadly sin” shall grieve that power away. Coeval, thus, with conscious thought The Church's heaven-born education is; By faith, far more than science, fraught,— The babe she fosters for angelic bliss; And on the platform of baptismal gift Erects the hopes which man to God uplift. Regen'rate by the law of Grace,— Behold! the bulwark of our Church's creed, In whose deep fulness Love can trace What more than satisfies Man's infant-need, And, in the Prayer-Book find that perfect key By which unlock'd our Liturgy must be. And here, the standard, and the test From whence true holiness is seen, and tried,— Whether within thy votive breast The Christ internal hath advanced, or died; Since Vows baptismal, with a seal divine, Gave thee to God, by sacrament, and sign. And thus, the Pulpit finds a truth According well with each liturgic tone; Destined alike, in age and youth, To keep the Church the Mother of her own,— Where the first blessings which the God-Man gives, Inspire the Sacrament by which she lives. The Circumcision of Christ. “It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.” —Prov. xxv. 2. “This is a great mystery.” —Ephes. v. 32. “Obedient to the law for man.” —Collect for the Circumcision. Weakness of faith is want of power In earthly type some heavenward truth to see, When Christ, in God's predestined hour, Descends by sacramental grace to thee, Shrouding His Presence in such gift divine With outward symbol, and appropriate sign. Ere forfeit Eden felt a blight, Or, Sin defeatured Soul's primeval trace, By dark'ning o'er with guilty night What beam'd at first in Man's unfallen race,— Ev'n then, a sacramental type and tree Emblem'd to Faith far more than Sense could see. Under a veil did Godhead choose To hide some glories from the gaze of Earth, And not by Heaven's immediate views At once discover, in their open worth, Almighty secrets, which pertain to Him Whose Throne is girt by wing-veil'd Seraphim. And thus, a harmony we find In all which Mercy condescends to do,— Laws of proportion, which mankind Might well consider, and revere them, too; For, God Incarnate is the Root of all In Heaven's benignancy, since Adam's fall. When pale alarm disciples thrill'd Of old, as once their risen Lord appear'd, And with melodious accent fill'd The air around them, by His voice revered,— “Handle and see,” His awful Goodness cried, Your living Master is the same Who died. And thus, in shroud material hid, Doth grace eternalise the Saviour's tone, And still our trembling reason bid The Lord of Sacraments and Love to own: “Handle and see,” those pregnant Symbols cry, His grace dwells here, Whose glory fills the sky! A mental antichrist is Mind, When Reason dares o'er Revelation mount, And, with rejecting passion blind, Disputes the channel which conducts the fount, Whence Grace comes gliding in its lapse of love Down to man's heart, from Christ's own Heart above. As God in flesh did condescend Celestial glories to allay, and hide, So the pure Spirit deigns to blend The mercies, which to outward means are tied, With elements of earth, and space, and time, Whose weakness makes the Wonder more sublime! The Epiphany. “God spake in visions of the night.” —Gen. xlvi. 2. “This is the night of The Lord.” —Exod. xii. 42. “When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.” —Gospel for the Day. Night is the true romance of time When shaded earth and sky seem blending, And Fancy hears that mystic chime Seraphic Hosts on high are sending From harps above, to heaven-tuned Minds below, Whose echoing chords receive their raptured overflow. Oft in the trance of this deep hour The sightless Dead may hover nigh, And o'er the Living wield a power, We feel not, whence, and know not, why:— Past years revive, and buried fond ones start In resurrection-dreams from out the mourning heart! Thus, laws may be, to man unknown, Whereby the spirit-world is sway'd, Whose spells are round a night-scene thrown In garden, grove, or haunted glade; Where gliding Angels to and fro may steal, On inward errand sent, and wing'd on plumes of zeal. Moon, star, and silence, kindred three,— Night is the hour when such prevail, And touch the earth with poesy, Or, bid our mental vision hail The power and presence of Diviner Things Than what coarse day-life views, or common Nature brings. Now, waves and winds a sabbath keep, The lull'd Creation seems to pray, And in the hush of holy sleep All wild emotions ebb away:— Calmness of soul and chastity of thought Melt through our being's depth, with pure religion fraught. But, more than Fancy gives to Night Are peerless charms which Saints admire; And they, whose hearts respond aright To all her dumb appeals inspire,— Remember well, what hour Th' Incarnate chose For supplicating watch, and not for mere repose. Thou Source and Subject of all prayer, Benign Redeemer! grant that we, When hymning stars on high declare Ps. xix. 6, compared with Rev. xix. 12. That speechless Name which shadows Thee,— Back to our souls Thy mountain-scene recall, Where Night and Nature heard the praying Lord of all! First Sunday after the Epiphany. “Mercifully receive the prayers of Thy people which call upon Thee.” —Collect for the Day. E'en to the inmost centre of the soul Burning with shame, let men confess the whole Of that vast debt to Law they owe; And, while Emanuel welcomes prayer, Be ours a Litany, inspired with—“spare, And soothe our agonising woe.” Low in the dust, we thus Thy Name adore: Thy ruin'd penitents to grace restore, And bring them back to heaven and Thee; So may the soul hereafter live, and shine In law's obedience, and with love divine Embrace reveal'd eternity. How blest are they, whose filial hearts and true, By Christ atoned, their sinful madness rue: And to the Priest Eternal bring Burdens of guilt, or shame, or gloomy crime, That darken hope, and agonize all time With pangs which the remorseful wring. Here doth the Church man's cheating world oppose, And teach equality to friends and foes, By proving,—all apostate are: Wealth, rank, and splendor, whose seductive lies The vain re-echo, and the vicious prize, Vanish, in one confession-prayer! And lift we, too, this lauding hymn of love To Him, the Priest of priesthood throned above,— That not with us, as once of old, Levit. xvi. The Priest alone within God's awful Shrine, Presenteth prayer in secresy divine Which none but Heaven and he behold. Not in the bondage of dread Law are we! But, in the fullness of the Gospel, free Around a throne of Grace to stand; And with the Priest our pleading voice to blend, Finding in God our Father and our Friend, With lowly heart, and lifted hand. Sion, not Sinai, is the Mount where man Enters within the veil of Mercy's plan; And there, oh Lord! thy Church is found: Sackcloth'd with grief, or, clothed with saintly zeal, Charter'd by heaven-born right, Herself 1 Tim. iii. 15. to feel Of Truth the pillar, and the ground. Second Sunday after the Epiphany. “Continuing instant in prayer.” —Epistle for the Day. “When ye pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.” —Luke xi. 2. With bended knee and bowing head As oft The Prayer of prayers is said, Till parch'd and panting spirits feel The mystic Heaven-dews o'er them steal, Time and eternity can meet With Man, before the Mercy-seat; And inward vision learn to view That sacramental oneness true, Which binds the Saviour and the soul In Unity of love's control. Adore we then, Incarnate God! Who, when our world of graves He trod And scatter'd blessings bright and fast As beams from out the sun are cast, And bore for Sin that awful curse Which else had sunk the Universe!— Before He drank His cup John xviii. 11. of Woe And drain'd it in death's overflow, Inspired us, as the Truth and Way Both how to live, and how to pray! All graces, which our being calm; All comforts, breathing inward balm; All hopes, and consolations deep In homes that wail, or hearts that weep, The Saviour-God doth thus declare Are promised by this boundless Prayer:— Whenever said, or sigh'd, or wept, Unflinching watch hath Jesu kept O'er each by whom His words are given Back to Himself, Who hears in Heaven. A miracle of Speech thou art! For, in Thee beats Emanuel's heart. Thy syllables like pulses seem To throb with all a Saint can dream Of tenderness, divine and deep Inspiring Him, Who lived to weep; Is. xliii. And in Thy concentrated truth Can hoary Age and lisping Youth Find echoed there Devotion's whole, When most it breathes, and burns with soul! Third Sunday after the Epiphany. “Shew thyself to the priest.” —Gospel for the Day. Of old, the sacerdotal blessing flow'd From Aaron's heaven-commission'd lips; And on Thy Church not less shall be bestow'd, Whose glories Law and Type eclipse, And to that “better Covenant” belong Based upon Him, the Stronger Luke xi. 22. than the strong. Dove of our souls! blest Paraclete! descend And bid the Priest Thy mouthpiece be, That with his breath absolving grace may blend, And what it saith, be signed by Thee; While, inly-prostrate with a kneeling heart, Devotion feels the Benison Thou art. Grace from the God Triune!—what more than this Can hearts enclose, or Christs bestow? Here found St. Paul a paradise of bliss,— The Heaven those highest raptures know, When most his fervours into flame arise And Love's farewell a final blessing sighs. So be it, Saviour! with Thy chosen now; Ere from the Temple-home they part Bid Thy pure radiance Num. vi. 25. clothe each pensive brow And threefold unction fill the heart, That Saints may ever by communion be Shrined John iv. 13. in thy depths, unfathom'd Trinity! Fourth Sunday after the Epiphany. “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.” —Epistle for the Day. Ruler Divine! in Whom alone A Monarchy's foundations lie, Ever around her ancient throne God save the Queen! let patriots cry. Though scepter'd with surpassing might And shrined in more than queenly splendour, 'Tis God Who seals her sacred Right, And Heaven which must on high defend her. Replenish'd be the regal-heart With gifts and graces, rich and rare; While health and wealth their boon impart, And blessings more than tongues declare. Nor pause we here: for, Queens must die; Truncheons, and crowns, and sceptres fall, When death shall close a Monarch's eye In that low dust which levels all. Hence, for our Island-Queen we pray That when her earth-bound reign is past And Kings are judged at Judgment-day,— Her Crown before the Lord be cast. Rev. iv. 10. God save the Queen! and guard her Crown By all which Church and Creed can bring; And ne'er let mad Rebellion frown, Or Faction her dread peans ring. Bulwark'd by loving Hearts which beat With loyalty, from heaven derived,— Thus may our Monarchs nobly meet That strength by which the Land has thrived. For, not in Arts, or Arms, or Skill, But in religion, Patriots find The Power Phil. ii. 13. which guides that human Will Whose motions bless, or blast mankind. Fifth Sunday after the Epiphany. “Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body.“ —Epistle for the Day. God is our Want,—come then, celestial Grace, Unction Divine, anoint Thy chosen race Who, spirit-born, Are not forlorn, But, sacramental heirs of promised heaven, And have the signs and seals of their adoption given. Blest be that Church, who thus convenes us all Morn, noon, and night, on Father-God to call; With blended heart To take our part In orisons, where praying Martyrs found Pure antipasts of heaven inspiringly abound. Let but some “two, or three,” together meet In blended homage at the Mercy-seat, And He is there To answer prayer, Who, not by numbers, but devotion, measures The yearning faith which seeks for Love's almighty treasures. “Knowledge of Truth, and Everlasting Life,”— Prayer of St. Chrysostom. Giver of both! oh, in this world of strife While sin and care Breathe everywhere, Time cannot tell, but, only future bliss, How limitless the soar of such high language is! Meanwhile, by speech, far wiser than we are, Wing'd on such words, saints mount on plumes of prayer, And in His name Those blessings claim Th' atoning Saviour for His people brought, With all that God can give, how infinitely-fraught! “The Spirit's Unity in bonds of peace” Brings heaven on earth, the world's divine release: Here is true wealth, And hope and health,— Highest of blessings which our hearts can share, Which leaves them prayerless all, by thus exhausting prayer! Sixth Sunday after the Epiphany. “What manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God.” —Epistle for the Day. “Merciful Father!”—in that word Thine Incarnation, Lord, unfolds More than mere Reason ever heard, Or, Science in proud search beholds. O Thou! Who, when some contrite heart By inward sigh ascends to Thee, An infinite Compassion art, Still, to Thy Church all-gracious be! Her heart-cries have a tone which moves The sympathizing Priest Divine, Who more, perchance, such music loves Than Angel-chants, before His shrine. Rock, Shield, and Sun, of Souls art Thou, The Church's everlasting Friend! And faith would realize Thee, now, And in Thy Courts devoutly bend. Hence, not as worldlings supplicate For time and wealth's decaying-things,— Souls merely seek a brighter state Than what this fever'd earth-scene brings; Nor yet, for selfish calm we pray Embower'd in some Arcadian spot, Where pangless hours may roll away Lull'd in soft dreams of life forgot: But, this Thy yearning saints desire,— More of Thyself to share and see, And, glowing with celestial fire, Anthem Thy Throne immortally. Septuagesima Sunday. “To humble thee, and to prove thee, and to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no.” —Deut. viii. 2. “So run that ye may obtain.” —Epistle for the Day. As Adam was in Eden tried By limitation's triple law, Which bade him see in Self denied What self-indulgence never saw, So we, who share his curse and crime, A kindred process still prolong: And, near six thousand years of time Have never proved that process wrong! Power, knowledge, pleasure—round those three A limit and a law are thrown, By which the Rights of Deity To Conscience make their meaning known. Self-will to Duty sacrifice, Or, Duty for self-will forego— Between them both probation lies, By which we purchase weal, or woe. Thus, Life one long temptation forms; Scene, time, or change the heart assails; And he alone resists their charms Whose creed o'er circumstance prevails. Probation is God's moral plan; Virtue and vice from hence begin To mould, or mar, the inward man, By holy choice, or wilful sin. The Will untried leaves Man unseen, No character can such display;— Nor saints, nor martyrs could have been, Except they chose the better Way. Hence, Trial proves the law of life, Election is of Will the soul; While, heavenward through mysterious strife Mount we to Him, Who guides the Whole. And, is it not a boundless thought Burden'd with doom'd eternity?— By evil choice our hell is wrought, In which to suffer, is to be! O Thou, Who art essential Grace, Spirit Divine, such faith inspire, That we may run our destined race In truth and love, which never tire. Thus, shall the Saviour be our guide, Whose life redeem'd the will to God, And proved, by human Self denied, Perfection was the path He trod. Sexagesima Sunday. “As a dream when one awaketh.” —Ps. lxxiii. 20. “The fashion of this world passeth away.” —1 Cor. vii. 31. “In weariness and painfulness.” —Epistle for the Day. The shadows of this dying state To fancy seem, as though they substance were; Yet Scripture, searching mortal fate, Predicts our glory to be gilded air.— But, though impassion'd dreams might be Embodied into bright reality, Life's doom would still be overcast, And leave the heart a Tantalus, at last. Alas! that such dominion gain These fruitless Edens of an o'erwrought brain, Which grow on falsehood, and deceive The Mind they dazzle, only to bereave. Pilgrims of hope, and heirs of Him Whose Throne is circled by the Seraphim,— How base we are, when earth-bred things To this bad world enchain our spirit-wings! Fortune and Fame, the laurel-crown Of vast Distinction, in adored renown, Each lauding Voice that lifts on high Whate'er of gifts enchanted thoughts descry, Combined with that far deeper bliss Home, health, and friendship, add to life like this,— What are they, but those minute-gleams By sunset mirror'd on the rippled streams! Would that, sin-blinded Souls might learn That secret love, so mercifully-stern, God teaches man by myriad ways Through the dark windings of imperill'd days!— This Now of Being is but shade, In fleeting hues of circumstance array'd, While, all excited Sense admires, Faints like a dream-flash, which in gloom expires! By sickness, pain, and harrowing woe, By cups of anguish, fill'd to overflow; By dark bereavement's dismal power And the hush'd pang of many a martyr'd hour; By inward griefs, by outward glooms And teaching wisdom of ten thousand tombs— Our Lord unwinds the World's deceit, And brings the mourner to His mercy-seat. O Thou! Who art the Light of Light, Clad by Whose beams, our darken'd souls grow bright; Thou mental Sun, insphered within,— Shine on these hearts, and scatter every sin! Each clouding spell, that shades our view Of dread Hereafter, all divinely-true, Dissolve; and through Thine healing rays Kindle cold worship into fervid praise. Like bubbles on the tide of Time Flash the false glories, wordlings call sublime: But, Grace can disenchant the dream Which makes mock shadow like a substance seem. Moulding our Will by plastic law, And shading Conscience with a secret awe,— Heaven's viewless Spirit to the soul Restores the Saviour, by His blest control. In our undying bosom wake The throbbing instincts of Eternity, And from each world-delusion take The spells that stand between our soul, and Thee: While, by Thy Sacrament of Blood, We pray Thee, Lord! to be our perfect Good, And learn, what Angels feel above,— That Heaven, is holiness, and Godhead, love. Quinquagesima Sunday. “Alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.” —John xvi. 32. “They understood none of these things: this saying was hid from them.” —Gospel for the Day. Alone, O Lord!—yet, “not alone,” Since oft Jehovah sends to Thee Almighty whispers from the Glory-throne, Attuned with His eternity; And guardian-angels, poised on balanced wing, Camp round Thy Soul, and anthem-worship sing. But, moral loneliness was Thine: And He, whose heart could echo back In words that flow'd from Feeling's inmost shrine, What Sorrow felt in life's worn track,— Found this cold earth one echoless array Of Spirits, turn'd from Him, and Truth away! If tears an angel-cheek might stain, Or heaven's deep calm be moved with sighs, Thrills that approach to Love's celestial pain Might well have touch'd the o'erawed skies,— When God Incarnate, ere for Man He died, Roam'd the bleak world, deserted and denied. Weary and faint, and fasting oft, More homeless far than beast, or bird, On lake, or shore, or Syrian mount aloft By awful musings inly stirr'd,— Apart lived Christ, all unperceived by man, And pray'd, and ponder'd o'er Redemption's plan. Thus, thoughts were His divine and vast, With meditations, high as holy, And wordless visions, which have never pass'd Forth from their finite melancholy, But, shrouded lay within that mute recess Where language could not reach their loneliness! And, who can read how God-Man wept, That, on His eye-lash hung a tear When o'er the human spirit darkly swept Dejection, woe, and inward fear, Or, think the Saviour groaned, and heaved a sigh, And scann'd the heavens with sorrow's pensive eye,— Nor feel, how much of anguish unreveal'd, Unveil'd, unheard, unknown, Dwelt in the purest depths of pain conceal'd, And left Emanuel's heart alone— Alone, beyond all loneliness to be Save in Thy Breast, embodied Deity! Unshared were His perceptions deep Of Nature, Providence, and Man, And Secrets, which their sacred darkness keep Since time and mortal thought began, Glided and gleam'd along that perfect Soul, Which bow'd beneath God's infinite control. Ash-Wednesday. ‘Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily lamenting our sins, &amp;c.” —Collect for the Day. The Man of Sorrows, in Whose tear The Church can type her own career, The God-Man, Whose profound extremes combined Whate'er of glory and of gloom His awful Person could assume,— On Mourners stamp'd the name of “blest” mankind. But, not o'er all sad Minds, which mourn Like orphans in a world forlorn, Have lips Almighty thus pronounced the, “bless'd;” For, grief is oft a selfish chord, Whose earth-tones can no proof afford. That God and grace have e'er the Will imprest. The mourners, who “about the streets” Eccles. xii. 5. Of thronging life the stranger meets, Full often are they but proud Sin in tears:— 'Tis worldly sorrow, working death, Which now intones their anguish'd breath, And fetters them with darkness, and with fears. Spent Minds, like these, none dare believe Are purely blest, because they grieve, Or pine, that earth no more their heaven supplies; But blest are they, who mourn within The rankling wound of venom'd sin, Waking, beyond all woe, their soul-heaved sighs. For, sin is that stupendous grief Which, out of God, finds no relief,— A tainting curse that cleaves to flesh, and soul; And, so abhorr'd around The Throne, The very Heavens Jer. ii. 12, 13. appear to groan, And bow dejected at its dread control! 'Tis true, bland nature's tear-drops flow To mark cold earth a churchyard grow, While tombs rise countless as the waves at sea; Sickness and sorrow, change and care, And pale-worn features, ev'ry where Reveal the hollowness vain life must be. But, Zion's mourners grieve, and pine, To think that Law and Love divine O'er caitiff Man can wield such transient sway,— How all the Trinity of grace One bosom-sin will oft displace, And give to passion's dream its boundless play. Such weepers mourn before the Lamb, And cry, “Oh! wretched that I am! Who shall deliver me, and burst my chain?”— Their hearts are crush'd, and inly rent To find what base alloy is blent With that “fine gold,” where virtue feels no stain. For this, they blush, and burden'd lie; In self-abhorrence, droop and sigh; And, when they think on Jesu's awful groan, Or, how the garden soil was wet And crimson'd with His bloody sweat,— Their hearts beat prayer, which Godhead hears alone! 'Tis here, a grief sublime appears; And rays of glory light the tears Of souls, which mourn for Heaven's almighty wrong: Oh! then descends the Paraclete And calms them with mild comfort meet, And turns their sadness to victorious song. Dejected Minds, who thus are blest, By sealing grace may be impress'd And bland and meek as Charity become: Reflective awe and deep'ning prayer The growing work of God declare, And bid them pant for Heaven's unclouded home. So, when these days of darkness cease, And holy death shall bring release From sorrow's gloom, and sin's intense alloy,— How will they glory in that God Who said, while earth's bleak wilds they trod, That they who sow in tears, shall reap in joy! First Sunday in Lent. “Jesus ? tempted of the Devil.” —Gospel for the Day. Dread father John viii. 44. of the lie first-born, Dark victim of apostate will, Who dared the thunder-blast of God defy And earth with desolation fill,— How did the Lord that Satan see alone In darkness scowling on th' Almighty-throne! And Love, and Law, and Life, were seen, By God incarnate, in their essence true; While all the mysteries which float between Faith's present hope and future view, By searchless wisdom were to Him disclosed On Whose high will the universe reposed. Alone in merit, and in might,— So did Emanuel win the grace Whereby the Spirit-born obtain the right Which seals our God's adopted race: And who, save He, could see with dreadless eye Where, deep in God, salvation's fountains lie? And thus, unechoed by mankind, Cloister'd in spirit lived the Lord In that hid sphere, where gazed no human mind, Nor friendship breathed one soothing word; By sinner bann'd, by saint not understood,— A Saviour-God in mental solitude! If ever heart unfathom'd were, Or, grief a lone and lofty thing, Say, was it not when Jesu breathed His prayer Under cold Midnight's dewy wing On some lone hill, while stars their vigils kept, And Angels worshipp'd, as their Maker wept! Alone, too, was the Lord of grace, In seeing all His Church would prove, When o'er the heaven of His almighty face Fell shades of superhuman love,— Those outward symbols of diviner thought Than earth-toned language into meaning brought. Alone in life, in death the same, So lived Incarnate God for man, Who bow'd eternity, and Flesh became To realise great Mercy's plan: For all He felt, yet, no compassions won,— His tears were many, but His smiles were none! Second Sunday in Lent. “The lost sheep of the house of Israel.” —Gospel for the Day. 'Tis not, because Thou art creation's King And, all the energies of wisdom Thine, Prostrate in prayer, would kneeling Worship bring A holocaust of hearts to deck Thy shrine: But we, by purchase and by portion, are Sheep of Thy fold, elected and redeem'd, And in life's wilderness, when faint and far, Bright on our path Thy pardon-smiles have beam'd. “Now” is man's time; salvation's priceless now! Divine Consoler, may we guard it well; And to Thyself our lives this moment vow,— They next may hover round the brink of hell! Dread we, O Lord! Thine awful love to grieve As once of old degraded Israel did; Nor tempt Thee, in dark wilds of death to leave Souls which pursue what faith and Heaven forbid. Hush we the heart! “Venite” let us hear Creation, Providence, and Grace repeat; Till Christ receive us, and the soul's career Be ever circling round His mercy-seat. The church's Canaan is no earth-made rest, No land of palm, or vine-clad hill, and glade; But that true Palestine, where all the blest In beams of glory are by God array'd. Heaven is the father-land of christian souls, The home, where all the holy yearn to be— By faith, while flesh their present doom controls, In fact, when time becomes eternity. Third Sunday in Lent. “Followers of God, as dear children.” —Epistle for the Day. Bend, Angel! from thy throne of bliss, A living type to see Whose pureness, in a world like this, Partakes of heaven and thee:— With lisping grace, and lovely awe, God's infant kneels in prayer, Looking, as if by faith it saw What lips cannot declare: For oh! that face with worship rife Tells more than tones convey,— Soft pulses of a secret life Deep in the bosom play. On earth, my Saviour once enwreath'd Around a sinless child His loving arms, and o'er it breathed A blessing deep as mild. And still, His breath of awful Love So charms our inward ear, That children seem to God above Angelically near. In vain would plastic Sculpture dream It moulds such beauty now; Or, poet-words reflect the gleam That sanctifies thy brow. For, earth and heaven around thee twine A double charm, which glows With more than marble can define, Or lyre-born language knows. How blest, to watch thy myriad ways Of fawn-like grace and glee, And call thee bright as vernal rays, Or, sun-tints on the sea! Or, hear the music of thy mind In broken lisps of song, Whose echo seems the spring-toned wind O'er leaflets borne along. Elastic as the vital breeze Thy fairy motions glide, With flexures of infantile ease To each glad step supplied. While golden locks in glitt'ring play Like woven sunbeams dance, And purer than the young-eyed May Thy soul's ethereal glance; And buds and blossoms, too, of thought Betray their beauteous spell,— Telling, that Christ within hath wrought What Angels love so well. Fourth Sunday in Lent. “We for our evil deeds do worthily deserve to be punished.” —Collect for the Day. Unsoothed by pardon, what is boastful life When burden'd with remember'd sin?— Gnaw'd by remorse, or gall'd with goading strife How hell-like is the heart within? Abroad, at home, awake, asleep, Ghosts of dead crime around us creep! A Nemesis there rules, which haunts the soul, A sightless Fury none can see; Whom neither falsehood, nor the fiends control, Whose lash is lost eternity— And that is,—guilt! beneath the curse Of Him who sways the Universe! Pris'ners of hope in Christ alone have found, By His anointed Priests imparted,— A threefold See Comber, &amp;c. pardon, which the Lord has crown'd, To cheer the bruised and broken-hearted; Whose sins, through penitence and prayer, Absolving lips of Truth declare On earth remitted, and in heaven the same, Matt. xvi. 19. By charter'd Priesthood:—such the creed Christ and His Church to contrite hearts proclaim, When pardon is their public need, Who in God's absolution find An anchor for the guilt-toss'd mind. O Thou! Whose Justice is “consuming fire” With which accusing conscience glows, Less than Thine Oath Ezek. xviii. 32. could never love inspire To feel, what rudest peasant knows,— How, not in vengeance, but in grace We most adore th' almighty-Face. Thy Paraclete, and true repentance, give, Fountain of all which faith imparts! And, since we learn, precisely as we live,— Be love the decalogue of Hearts, Who in Thy law their wills employ And find obedience perfect joy. Fifth Sunday in Lent. “He that is of God, heareth God's word.” —Gospel for the Day. The glorious Sun no man can see Except his eye may sun-like be; And thus, the Bible is not understood, Unless a sympathy divine The heart attracts for Truth divine, And love, not learning, prompt it to be good. But if they read with child-like awe,— Diviner truths than Plato saw Adoring peasants on their knees discern; While Secrets, which were veil'd of yore, And Angels study, more and more, The infant-scholars of The Spirit learn. Oh, peerless Book, for heart and head!— Though thirteen years St. Basil read Its saving wisdom, in the light of prayer; And all of Creed the Church can know, To guide her on through weal, and woe, Flows from a Thummim, and a Urim, there. Dungeon and cell, and martyr's den, Whate'er has tried, or tortured men By scorching fire, or persecuting sword,— How have they borne them unafraid, Those Heroes, whom the Lord array'd And inly weapon'd with His matchless Word? And she, of martyr'd saints the Mother, Our guide to heaven, and not another,— Free as the air the glorious Bible gives! And, bless we God, that in this Book The lowest of her children look, And hear His voice by Whom creation lives. Each Lesson, with maternal care Adjusted well for praise, and prayer, Long may adoring hearts in love peruse; Until, from sin and self made free, Our lives embodied scripture be, And, when the Saviour calls, no cross refuse! Holding His piercèd Hands on high Before enthronèd Deity, The God incarnate as our Priest prevails:— Go, seek His interceding grace, And in the light of That blest Face Behold a Sympathy, which never fails! If, as we live, the truth we learn, And as we love, our God discern, Spirit of Christ! Thy Word interpret all,— Till scripture with divine control Reign like a soul within a soul, And, prove us, Children, when on God we call. Monday before Easter. “Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover?” —Gospel for the Day. Oh! if indeed, the hunger'd mind And thirsting heart for Jesus long, Then, will they not meet nurture find To nurse, and make religion strong?— Incarnate God! such mystic food Thine Own ordaining words supplied, Which in Thy Body and Thy Blood A banquet for the soul provide. John vi. 54. Thy sacred Flesh, oh! let us eat, And drink the awful Wine-blood, there, While faith Thy bleeding Form can greet Amid the swell of deep-toned prayer:— The blast and blight of unbelief Those famish'd hearts alone infect, Who feel no pang of holy grief When men such angel-food neglect. Soul of our souls! almighty Grace, A sacramental life impart, And, by some inward power, erase Whatever dulls the deaden'd heart: For holiness a hunger give, And yearnings of intenser love That we on Christ may learn to live, Like daily Manna, from above. In heaven abides no Sacrament; Nor signs, nor symbols, there abound When Glory with its full content Shall each elected Saint have crown'd:— Adorn'd in robes of radiant white, They neither thirst, nor hunger more, Who bask in beams of pure delight With all their toils and trials o'er. Around the Throne, in rich array, Perfect and sinless are they now, And in God's temple, night and day Before that Shrine of glory bow,— The Lamb Himself their food supplies, And on His fulness they can feed, Who follow Him with tearless eyes Where paths to living fountains lead. Tuesday before Easter. “God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded.” —Epistle for the Day. This world becomes a barren scene To eyes of sunny Youth, When vices have victorious been And falsehoods vanquish'd truth;— Where good men weep, and Virtue droops in shade, And Minds of most heroic mould, are blighted and betray'd. Thus, to pale martyrs of the Cross, Distracted earth appears An orphan'd realm, where pain and loss Demand perpetual tears: And, were it all which God for man decreed,— Who would not, in despair, for widow'd Nature bleed? But, soon will dawn a radiant Clime Where sin nor sorrows reign, Beyond the clouds of changing time To shadow, or to stain,— A bright eternity of balm and bliss Where pangless Hearts forget a life so false as this. And, let the full-toned anthem rise In swells of grateful joy, That Faith beholds with prescient eyes What time nor tears destroy,— A perfect life, compensative of all Impetuous thoughts presume unworthy Heaven to call. It was not thus, ere christian light Arose on heathen-gloom, For then, the soul, immersed in night, Found life a living tomb; Confusion reign'd o'er providence denied, And, when of death it thought, the craven bosom sigh'd! But now, a beam celestial plays From out the page Divine; And o'er the gloom of grief-worn days What dawning glories shine!— O'er ruin'd hopes descending to the grave The banners of the Cross sublimely float, and wave. Wednesday before Easter. “There appeared an Angel unto Him.” —Gospel for the Day. “Ministering Spirits ? for the heirs of Salvation.” —Heb. i. 14. Confirm'd, tho' not redeem'd, by Him,— Lord of the radiant Hosts above, Legions of loyal Seraphim In Christ concentre all their love: Thus, Saints and Angels both combine To chant the praise of Blood divine. And must we, now the God-man reigns In regions where no senses roam, Refuse to hear angelic strains Float through the heart, and fill our home? Have Seraphim quite ceased to walk Man's world, and with our spirit talk? 'Tis true indeed, nor eye nor ear Their Shape discern, nor know their voice; But still, they haunt a human sphere To make elected souls their choice; And near, may watching Angels be, Though nothing but blind earth they see! Oh! never till the clouds of Time Be rent by awful death from man, And he from yonder heaven sublime That scene recall, where life began,— Will gather'd saints, in glory, know What blessings men to Angels owe. This earth is but a thorny wild, A tangled maze where griefs abound, By sorrow vex'd, by sin defiled, Where foes and fiends our walk surround,— Yet, does not dread Jehovah say, Angelic Guardians line the way? The precipice men rarely find, No avalanche on them may fall,— But, petty woes distract the mind And take sweet temper from us all: As some, by thickets are o'erthrown, Whose feet escaped the crushing stone. Mean trifles our true dangers make, Weak'ning the spirit unawares; And tiny griefs would often break The heart unbow'd by pond'rous cares, Did not our guardian-Angels glide, And watch, unseen, the naked side. Some pebble in our daily path, The little stone we scarce behold, A world of secret ruin hath O'er which might trip the brave and bold,— If no blest Angel's viewless arm Shielded the soul from sudden harm. And moods are felt, no words define, When earth and heaven appear to meet, While Faith half hears a Tone divine From out yon orbs of Glory greet Each praying heart, and placid soul That echoes to such sweet control.— Or, when some beams of holy Light Around Dejection seem to play, And from lone hours of suff'ring night Melt half their haunted gloom away,— Emperill'd souls those Angels see Who hover by the bended knee. Sickness and sorrow, too, may have Ethereal Hosts, whom none perceive, Whose golden wings around us wave, When all alone men seem to grieve; And, while we sigh, or shed the tear, Their sympathies may flutter near. Or, by some law, to Man unknown, Their spells may o'er us act, and steal, And strengthen Faith upon her throne, When fury-passions make us feel How Self and Sin would monarchs be, And give the law to Deity! Thus, human life from them may take Some moral tinge, or mental hue, Which, not till dust the soul forsake, Elected saints will value true:— Before God's throne, and only, then, These Guardians will be thank'd by men. Thursday before Easter. “There followed Him a great company of women.” —Gospel for the Day. “There stood by the Cross of Jesus, His Mother.” —John xix. 25. Encircled by Christ's awful glory, Her vestal radiance, faint and far, Beams through some word of hallow'd story Remotely as a virgin star,— Whose quiv'ring brightness with uncertain gleam Touches dark ocean's wave, or tips the wand'ring stream. But, though we hail no “Queen of Heaven,” Nor thrust a creature on His Throne To Whom the Trinity have given A right to reign there, all alone,— That sainted Mary proved a second Eve By contrast and by grace, regen'rate souls believe. And, She endured that piercing “Sword” Luke i. 35. Which prophecy had o'er her waved, And lived to view her bleeding Lord By whose dread Blood herself was saved,— Nail'd on the Cross, incarnadined for death, And thrill the shaken Earth by His departing breath! But when from mortal space and time Th' ascending Christ his Form withdrew, Bath'd in the depths of grief sublime,— Can words reveal what Mary knew Of voiceless woe, as Calv'ry's hour return'd Back on her bruisèd heart, that still a Son discern'd! And, what to her, but exile, now, Could this cold life of care have been, Since He, Whom earth and heaven avow, Had vanish'd from this weeping scene, And she was doom'd companionless to roam, Though shielded by St. John, in his Ephesian home? Could Mary, in some realm divine Of holy calm, or heavenly rest, One throb of pain with bliss combine In the meek shrine of her pure breast,— She well might shudder, on God's throne to see The “Handmaid” of the Lord, that Lord's own rival be! O thou! in Whom two Natures blend By Incarnation's awful plan, Not less in heaven, our human Friend Than while on earth, a homeless Man,— Teach Thine elect to worship Thee aright, With garments wash'd in Blood, through Thine own radiance bright. Souls need not fence Thy Mercy-Seat With interceding Saint, or Virgin; Nor, can it be for man unmeet When Faith her solemn plea is urging,— Directly on that Lord of Love to call, Where God Himself enshrines the Church's all-in-all. Good Friday. “We are sanctified, through the offering of the Body of Jesus Christ, once for all. ? sins and iniquities will I remember no more.” —Epistle for the Day. This Day earth and heaven unites By such bonds of perfect peace, That Rom. viii. 20, 21. creation's heart delights In atonement's blest release, While our bleeding God declares, Out of Christ,—the world despairs! Foolish all false wisdom is, If to merit heaven, it tries; He who claims a power like this Is ensphered beyond the skies: Man, at most, can human be,— What we want, is Deity! Blessed Christ! embodied Word! Thou alone art Life and Light; Saints who have Thy truth preferr'd Walk in peace, and worship right; Thou alone, to sin canst say, “I am Love, the Living Way.” Sun of Grace! oh, ever shine Round our paths, where'er they lead:— Midnight feels a ray divine Breaking through the darkest need, If we hear, when most dismay'd, “It is I! be not afraid!” Pardon, peace, and purity, Gifts without, and grace within, Love and light, that set us free From the curse, and chain of sin, These, Emanuel! Thou canst give While upon Thy words we live. Not a need, Thou canst not fill; Not a fear, Thou wilt not tame: If, indeed, repentance will Rest upon Thy glorious Name,— High o'er ev'ry guilt and grave Shall Redemption's banner wave! Lord, then whither shall we go, Save to Thee, our Refuge sure? Balm to each bereaving woe, Who alone the heart canst cure,— Turning sickness into health, And, to want, becoming wealth. Well of Comfort! Vital Spring! Other source we dare not seek: Broken cisterns only bring Mocking draughts, which make us weak: If our souls would slake their thirst, They must die, or seek Thee, first! Saviour! be our polar Star Shaded by no sinful night; Shed upon us from afar Living beams of holy light:— When we reach our radiant Home We shall know the way we come: Easter Even. “It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.” —Epistle for the Day. Hosannah! cry celestial Hearts Whom persecution brands, And bear, unmoved, infernal darts When hurl'd by godless hands; 'Tis thus, the soldiers of the Truth are train'd,— Those heroes of the Lord, who heaven's own laurels gain'd. By love, and patient suff'ring led, More Christlike men become; And, meekly while the path we tread Which leads our spirit home,— Our graces brighten, while they vanquish woe, And saintly virtue springs from soils where trials grow. And, do we not corruption feel Our purest dreams assail, While wounds which grace alone can heal Make harrow'd conscience pale?— But, these are cleansed by consecrated fire, As persecuted saints more soaringly aspire. When clothed with age, or clad with youth, Whate'er life's era be, Men glorify the force of truth Who God in anguish see; And prove, what strength His promises impart Who, high upon His Throne, can hear the fainting heart! In all things should the Church reflect Her regal Lord divine; And ne'er with sin, or change, or sect, Her vestal charms 2 Cor. xi. 2. combine: To suffer, is the privilege of love,— In which the saints outsoar, what Angels do above. Then, wonder not, if sighs or tears, Or contumelious shame, Inweave the web of perill'd years, Nor God's deep wisdom blame; But rather, in Earth's malediction see A shadow of the Cross—endured, O Lord, by Thee. Those peerless graces hearts require To fit the saints for heaven, Are burnish'd by that sacred fire To martyr'd anguish given:— Love, faith, and valour, are the three which make The stature of the Soul her full perfection take. Easter Day. “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.” —Epistle for the Day. Risen with Christ!” “In baptism ye are also risen with Him” (Col. ii. 12)—oh, radiant thought That well may brighten through some angelbreast; For, were its perfect influence wrought, The World would realise sabbatic rest From sin and guile, and all we find To mar the halcyon of the mind. When choral winds of April chant And green Earth hymns a resurrection-song, While gently o'er each new-born plant Steal, like seraphic plumes, soft airs along, Till balm and freshness sweetly blend And through the soul their magic send,— Say, is not each a Type which tells Some moral lesson to each musing heart, Where faith the Body's future spells By language deeper than our lips impart— In forms of Matter finding lore, By saints in silence ponder'd o'er? From Christ, man's Easter was begun, In Whose ascension all the saints ascend; Incorp'rate with Th' Incarnate Son, They with Himself in vital union blend, And, by that Sacrament are made, The mystic Bride for whom He pray'd. “In baptism ye are also risen with Him” (Col. ii. 12). And from the Fontal wave there flows A soaring virtue of celestial power, “If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him” (2 Tim. ii. 12). Which in the heart regen'rate glows And opens Heaven on each adoring hour,— Revealing to the inner Man All that on earth such vision can. Hence, is not Christ, as risen Lord, By Pattern, Principle, and Power, our own? While, in the heaven of His true word, All saints become the sharers of His throne Who, when He soar'd to Deity, Said, “Where I am, my saints shall be.” O Privilege, beyond compare! Ideal utmost of almighty Grace, The paradise besought in prayer, The last perfection of our pardon'd race,— In heaven to have the risen heart With Christ and Angels, taking part! There, is the City pure of gold, See Apocalypse, passim. Whose streets are jasper, gemm'd with gates of pearl, More bright than poet-dreams behold; Where neither sin, nor woe, nor passion's whirl, Infect with their defiling stain The Bowers where peace and pureness reign. Such dwelling-place of Bliss Divine, The central Home of sanctity and calm, Within whose depths all powers combine To heal the wounded heart with holy balm— Why is it, that yon World above So little wins the soul to love? Alas! too oft, like earth-worms, we Cling to coarse joys, by mean attraction bound,— In time absorb eternity, And with the Belials of base earth are found, When, true to heaven and Him, we ought Soar Christ-ward, on ascending thought. We barter privilege for sin, Are moral suicides, through sensual bliss; O'ercloud the dawning heaven within, And lose our glory for a World like this— A World which crucified her God When once this vale of woe He trod! Yet, is it but a mocking scene, A gilded mis'ry graced with mantling smiles, Where ulcerated hearts, I ween, Rankle in secret, under gayest wiles, And the loud laugh too plainly tells What hollowness within them dwells. “Risen with Christ!” if words have wings, Ascended Lord, on these thy saints may soar, And, where the hallelujah rings, Of Thine own Chorus, Thee in light adore; And, long ere time and earth depart, Soar into heaven, by hope and heart. Monday in Easter Week. “Ye walk, and are sad,” —Gospel for the Day. “Without father, without mother.” —Heb. vii. 3. But one week past, and thou wert here, A living, though a pain-worn creature; And round thy couch, with quiet tear, We stood, and watched each waning feature But now, in light and bliss, to thee belong The Saviour's presence, and the angel-song. Departed Spirit! pure as kind, That peerless gift, a precious Mother! Our hearts with grief are almost blind, And pierced with pangs we cannot smother:— Thine orphaned children see their sacred loss, And sink beneath the burden of their Cross! If mercies brighten, as they leave The shrines of love where they were dwelling, How must our riven bosoms grieve, While each to each is fondly telling Maternal virtues, which were faintly scann'd Until they left us for the Spirit-land! A myriad spells of heart and home Back to pale mem'ry seem returning, And, when to girlhood's bower we roam, Our souls with ancient dreams are burning; Or, thrill beneath some love-awaking word Oft in our maiden-prime of gladness heard. We prayed around our father's bier In pangs of hushed and holy sorrow, And felt within that wordless fear Which prophesies a sad to-morrow; And when the sister of our souls departed, Life fainted in us, as the broken-hearted:— But oh! a Mother is a sacred thing, Association's fondest centre; Who shadows childhood with her wing, And who alone, by love can enter Into the deepest, purest shrines of thought, Where infant mind the creed of heaven is taught. And thus, we mourn thee, mild and meek, In matron-softness, ever shrinking From that proud glare bright worldlings seek, And of thy God serenely thinking:— Fresh joys may bloom, and radiant hopes may be, But second mother ne'er can orphans see! Still, vanished Spirit, thou art blest, Bosom'd in peace, and blissful glory; Sin cannot mar thy sainted rest, And, when we think who went before thee, Dear to thy heart, as thou to us hast been,— The soul's Hereafter grows a household-scene. There, is our meeting-place of Bliss! The Home Divine, where, re-united, Friends who have left a world like this Mingle again their souls delighted,— Mother, and daughter, sister, sire, and son, In heaven renewing what on earth begun. A few brief years of anxious life, Of fev'rish care, or toilsome being,— And then will come our parting strife When we, from time and sorrow fleeing, Shall view the Region of the awful dead, And children follow where a mother led. The grave! the grave! our hearts roam there, And now, with Love's internal weeping Would pardon seek, by sorrowing prayer, From her in Abram's bosom sleeping,— Should girlish temper, or unduteous tone, Have ever pained the Spirit that is flown. And, if the dead communion hold, Or, with the living here, are blended,— As martyr'd saints conceived of old— Then, not for us thy love hath ended, But round about us, though we trace it not, May weave protection for our orphan'd lot. And, Mother! if thy conscious soul Still aught of mortal power retaineth, Waft round our path thy pure control As long as perilled life remaineth: And oh, accept, what we present with tears,— Regret for all we did to shade thy years! In tender gloom and twilight-dream, By meadow-walks, or moon-lit ocean, Oft will thy featur'd Shadow seem To haunt the heart's profound emotion:— Move where we may, some instinct will restore That form maternal, Time shall greet no more. God of the motherless, and sad! Life's bruisèd reed seems almost broken, Since, how to them can earth look glad, Whose brightest meanings must betoken A blank,—which makes our orphan'd hearts to see Like mother-love, no human love can be. Tuesday in Easter Week. “Open unto us the gate of everlasting life.” —Collect for the Day. They are all gone!—that sunny band of youth, Who once our hearts and homes surrounded With eyes of love, and lips of fearless truth, And breeze-like step which gaily bounded. Gone to that glory-world, let faith believe, Where neither sins nor sorrows reign, And the pure Dead, for whom the living grieve, Heaven shall reveal in light, again. They are all gone!—but still, each form and face Our resurrection-dreams revive, And oft unsepulchre each buried grace That so entranced us, when alive! Why are the dead, so mighty when no more, Touch'd with a charm no words can tell, When their deep voices from th' Eternal Shore Come wafted with an inward-spell? Perchance, they rule us by that mystic law Which acts within their world of calm, And gently soothe with sanctifying awe The Hearts that need such holy balm? Earth knows not why; but trees, and buds, and flow'rs, Step, air, and mien,—a myriad things By Time confronted in his casual hours, Feature the heart's imaginings: Some chord is touch'd by circumstance, and, lo! Dead Years from out their tombs arise, Till all we cherish'd, in this vale of woe, Arrest the soul's enchanted eyes! Thus live the dead; the lovely never die; Social we are, when most alone; And mem'ry, while it breathes a votive sigh, Still proves the sainted past our own. First Sunday after Easter. “Glad, when they saw the Lord.” —Gospel for the Day. A mother may her babe forget, An exile ne'er his home recall, Nor orphan'd child the hour regret That reft him of parental all: But oh, whate'er the scene, or clime, Devotion may Immanuel see,— Whose heart expanded over time, And bled for our eternity! Yes, sympathies intense and deep, Surpassing all our souls contain, Still through His breast, in glory, sweep, And shall for ever glow and reign. A sinless Lord, yet, touch'd in heart With all which blighted moments bear,— In heaven, O Priest Divine! Thou art, A Man-God, with our feelings, 3 Heb. iv. 15. there! By gentleness, by grief and grace, By depth of sigh and tears profound, Faith views Thee, to our fallen race In links of loving union bound. Both heaven and earth in Thee combine, In Whom that mystic Wound Rev. i. 7; v. 6. appears, Which gash'd in death Thy Form divine And crimson'd it with gory tears. Then, lay thy burden on the Lord, Child of dejection! pale and lone; Thou canst not sigh, by Him unheard, Whose heart throbs human on His throne. Second Sunday after Easter. “Endeavour to follow the blessed steps of the most Holy life.” —Collect for the Day. If such Thy will, by wooded streams, Or vales of blissful calm Where the deep hush of holy dreams Inspires unearthly balm, And from green hills the gladden'd eyes Look speechless hymns beyond the skies,— If there embower'd, Thou wilt our lot to be, Lord of the landscape fair! we glow to “follow” Thee. Or, if Thy regal Word decide, That cities throng'd and loud Which billow with the restless tide Of life's tumultuous crowd, Should be our peopled deserts, where Unechoed hearts conceal each care,— Still may our souls, by meek compliance, find The ever-present Christ, an anchor for the mind. Love need not quit the humblest call, But calmly work, and wait:— Our safety dwells where duties all Attend our mortal state. Messiah did not die to give Each heart the choice where faith would live; But, this He grants to all who seek for grace,— The guidance of His truth, and glory of His Face. Ps. iv. 6, 7. Yes, “Follow Me!” be this the word, The motto of our lives; Morn, noon, and night, let such be heard When sin, or Satan strives: Should Passion rage, or Pride begin, Or treason-banners rise within,— In all we feel or fancy, do or dare, Let Thy mild “Follow Me,” pursue us ev'rywhere. Great Captain of the meek and good, Whose crimson guilt and stain Shall never, through Thine awful blood, Assail their souls again!— In self-denial, grief, or loss, In all we have of care, and cross, Thy Hand of mercy out of heaven bestow, And let us feel Its grasp, where'er our footsteps go. Thy path was one of pain, and grief, A sacrifice of love; Nor God, nor Angel brought relief From bowers of bliss above: We ask not, then, poetic fields Where life all bloom and brightness yields; But this we seek,—a soul from murmurs free, Whose heaven on earth it proves, in all to follow Thee. Third Sunday after Easter. “A little while, and ye shall not see me.” —Gospel for the Day. Abide with us!”—why pray we so, As if Disciples did not glow With Thine own promise sure? “Lo! I am with you, till the chime Of Ages sounds the last of Time, While earth and man endure.” Yes, Thou art “with us,” in Thy word; Thy Voice in sacraments is heard, And prayer and praise reveal How through the soul Thy blessings glide, As o'er the heart's most gloomy tide Thy radiant comforts steal. Dejection, oft, but not despair, In this tried world of woe and care It may be ours to face; Only, be Thou the sleepless Guide, And, morn and night, with us abide Till we complete our race. We ask not, blissful calms to dwell Around us with unbroken spell, Nor seek a pangless lot; But, by the breathing of Thy word Be our faint bosoms freshly-stirr'd, Nor sigh,—as if forgot! Fifth Sunday after Easter. “Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you ? ask, and ye shall receive.” —Gospel for the Day. Prayer conquers scene, and space, and time, Entreats no temple, and demands no clime, But, like an omnipresent charm, Can shield the saints from all corrupting harm:— Howe'er remote from genial home The surging waves of life may bid them roam, Oft riven Friendships pray afar, Each thrilling each, beneath some alien star. Elijah, Moses, Jonah, pray'd: And, how those heroes of The Spirit sway'd Nature, and Providence, and Man!— As though the movements of almighty-plan, However fathomless they were, Hung on the breathings of a human prayer; Or else, that He, whose will is law, Was sway'd in heaven, by what on earth he saw. Gen. xviii, 23–33. And mark, thou prayerless Thing of dust! If doubt, thy God, and reason, be thy trust,— How Abram, that elect of heaven To whom the Church's promises were given, With sixfold intercession bent Before His wrath, enthroned Omnipotent; And, when the bolt was almost hurl'd, By prayer held back His thunders from the world! Ascension Day. “In heart and mind thither ascend, and with them continually dwell.” —Collect for the Day. Child of the Spirit! high o'er earth While sin and sorrow have their birth, The ever-dark, and ever-deep,— Ascend the realms of radiant Glory And worship Him who went before thee, “I go to prepare a place for you.” (John xiv. 2.) Where hearts nor sin, nor eyelids weep,— Sursum corda. Bad, at the best, this world appears, And, moisten'd with memorial-tears Besprinkl'd o'er uncounted graves; But, Light of Light! and Lord of Lords! Oh, breathe from out Thy living words The truth which sanctifies, and saves,— Sursum corda. For, had we more than dreams infold, Or Crœsus grasp'd, with all his gold, And every sense entranc'd in joy,— Unresting still the soul would be, Whose full repose in Deity Alone exists, without alloy,— Sursum corda. Mount heavenward, therefore, soaring Heart! And let thine eagle-pinions “They shall mount up with wings as eagles.” (Isaiah xl. 31. dart Around Emanuel's priestly throne: Incarnate Mercy, view it there! The Source of praise, the Spring of prayer, And in Whose life we live alone,— Sursum corda. Giver of ev'ry needed Grace! Lift out of Sin our sunken race Free from the flesh-born chains of time; Let heaven our gravitation “Amor meus, pondus meum.” St. Augustine. prove, And poise us in its perfect love While centred in such calm sublime,— Sursum corda. The mental antichrist of man, Apostate Science, often can Darken our faith in doubt and dread, But, if the soul be truly Thine, Then, reason is Thy law divine, And by its will, our own is led,— Sursum corda. Life-giving Spirit! let Thy breath Defend us from that inward death Whose chillness o'er each grace would steal; And then, Thy Church herself will be A sacramental Type of Thee, Replete with innocence and zeal,— Sursum corda. And Thou, ascended Prince of Peace! Whose awful Merit won release From present guilt, and pangs to come, Grant freedom, pure as Seraphs find, Who worship thee with sinless mind In heaven, which is our common home,— Sursum corda. Let Faith but once that Veil undraw Which curtains what Thy martyr saw See Acts, vii. 55. When dying into deathless fame,— Celestial life will quicken, then, And emulate those saintly men Who chanted o'er Thy Cross and Shame,— Sursum corda! And thus, amid those myriad charms That work and wield their subtle harms, The spirit down on earth to chain, All scene for prayer a church will prove, All consciousness a creed of love, And around us swell the strain,— Sursum corda! Sunday after Ascension Day. “We beseech thee, leave us not comfortless.” —Collect for the Day. Songs in the noon of joyous health When all around smiles weal, or wealth, A festive world can often awaken; But, when our bright-wing'd mercies roam Far from the bowers of blissful home,— The famish'd Heart pines all forsaken! Sorrows, indeed, to us belong; And more of elegy than song Befits a race, whose unwept sin Has grieved the awful God within. But, hath not Christ a Bride on earth? And, is there not a spirit-birth? Or, must no choral anthems rise By Seraphs wafted through the skies? Oh, did we more rehearse for heaven, To whom Redemption's harps are given,— Prophetic gleams of future joy Would brighten off each base alloy. Songless men are, because they bow Before some earth-god's sceptre now, And mantle Time with deeper shade Than providential nights have made. Nor parentless, nor poor, is he, Who in God's Father-name can see The refuge each disciple hath To shield him, in life's orphan-path. The Word divine is starr'd with beams Which radiate our blackest dreams; Nor can our life confront a grief On which no promise smiles relief. But, fruitless prove these hearts of ours, Like sands beneath the balmy showers: From heaven and hope beguil'd away,— They wonder, night subdues their day! Yet Christ can dawn through woe and care, Responding to each duteous prayer; Nor feel we sickness, pang, or sorrow, When He arrays our bright to-morrow. Whit-Sunday. “We will come and make our abode with him.” —Gospel for the Day. Where is my Saviour's earthly home In which He deigns to dwell, And sacramental Graces come With their divinest spell?— Creation's priests true poets are Who sacrifice to Song, And worship Him, as everywhere, To Whom their lyres belong. Above, around, and all below, Where crowding grandeurs thrill The mind with reverential glow, From forest, mead, or hill— The Beautiful, the Bright and Fair Preach Christ to saintly hearts; Or, waken that unworded prayer God's secret life imparts. And, often round some cottage-hearth His wingèd mercies wait, ving to humble peace a worth Beyond imperial state. But though an omnipresent Lord Faith ev'rywhere divines, It learns from His revealing Word Where Godhead most enshrines The riches of His grace for Man,— And that, the Church is proved! Wherein He works Redemption's plan, By saint and martyr loved. Where two or three together meet, Lo! in the midst is One Who hears adoring hearts, which beat With life His Breath “He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” (John xx. 22.) begun. Receptive of all prayer and praise, He counts each heavenward sigh, And meets with sympathetic gaze The Souls which look on high. And, by that Font of second Birth, Whose mystic waters gleam With something more than soilèd earth Can understand, or dream,— There, stands the Lord of viewless grace With His regen'rate spells, A seed to sow, no eye can trace Till future saintship tells. His Home is in the Priesthood, too, While that deep promise stands,— “Go preach My Word, for which on you I lay ordaining Hands.” But, if there be a Rite of awe Where God's redemptive grace Becomes, by preternat'ral law, Incorp'rate with our race, Say,—is it not that sacred feast, Where Christ Himself imparts, Under the types His chosen priest Offers to feeding hearts? Oh! Banquet of celestial bliss, An Aliment for heaven, Wherein the future Body is By germs of myst'ry given. “Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.” (John vi. 54.) Thus, in His members, which are One, By union with their Head,— Is present God's Incarnate Son Who once for sinners bled. The Church is, thus, Emanuel's home, His dwelling-place, and shrine, From whence, if wilful error roam, It forfeits hope divine; While hearts, made wise in holiness, Attuned by constant prayer,— The Lord will beautify and bless, And throne his spirit there. Monday in Whitsun Week. “Rejoice in his holy comfort.” —Collect for the Day. Life is a fever, Man a living thirst, A Want unfathom'd, which no creatures fill; And, less than Infinite but leaves him curs't— Though, rich as Crœsus, yet, a pauper still! But, glory to embodied Love! which came Down from pure bliss, to suffer, bleed, and die; On earth, compassion, and in heaven, the same, Whose heart is echo'd by the Church's sigh; As in our world of wasting grief, The blinded vagrant and the beggar lone Heard from His lip the music of relief, And deep compassion in divinest tone,— So, in far secresy of splendour, now Heaven above heavens, enshrined in awful calm,— Anguish to Him may lift the sunken brow, And bathe her forehead in celestial balm. Perfect in Manhood, as in Godhead, pure, Still on His throne those sympathies remain Which taught Him, once, man's trial to endure, And the keen throbbings of terrestrial pain. Thus, none are blighted, lonesome, and unblest, Save moral suicides, whose crimes destroy Creation's refuge and the sinner's rest, By leaving Christ for some created joy. Hence, may our lives a liturgy of love, Lord of bright worlds! for our redemption be, And learn below, that Secret Psalm xxv. 14. from above,— No hearts are restless, which repose on Thee. Tuesday in Whitsun Week. “I am the Door ? I am come that they may have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” —Gospel for the Day. All growth is God in mystery; For who, in nature, or in grace, The sightless Hand of Deity In this deep work can rightly trace? The mode, the measure, and the plan Whereby the germs of heaven begin, Baffle the boundless pride of Man Seduced by intellectual sin. Thus may it be, when infant-souls Baptismally by Christ renew'd Their sacramental Lord controls, And works the inward grace He would. The darlings of the Spirit seem, To hearts with rude emotion rife,— Unvisited by voice, or dream That symbols more than mortal life. They lisp, and prattle, play and smile, As lovingly their dawning powers, Embodied by some baby-wile, Attract us in delighted hours. But, soon will deeper shades begin To mantle over brow and cheek, And tokens of The Christ within, Adumbrate more than lips can speak. Ah! who can tell, how grace divine Incorporates with early thought That hidden spell, of which no sign To Manhood's blunted mind is brought? Enough for saints, this truth to know,— That infancy to Christ was dear, Who, when on earth, a Man of woe, Bade faith itself that Age revere. Thus, to the Font our babes we bring, Assured that He is present there, And, under His almighty wing Leave them to grow, in love and prayer. Trinity Sunday. “ ? Grace by the confession of a true faith, ? keep us steadfast in this faith evermore.” —Collect for the Day. Oh! Time, beneath the blast of thy dread wings While fleetly wanes the world we see, God has retain'd some glorious things To image Man's eternity. Let Hist'ry take her meditative stand And vision, in some dream sublime, The wreck of all the Earth calls grand In ev'ry age, and ev'ry clime; O'er wither'd skeletons of haughty Realms And ghosts of wond'rous Empires gone, And Cities, which destruction 'whelms, As centuries come rolling on, Palace, and forum, temple, arch, and piles Of Babylonian make and mould,— O'er each and all, grim Ruin smiles And sternly cries to man, “Behold!” Genius and science, skill, and haughty lore, Are fluctuation's mingled prey; And what our earth-born tastes adore Glide, like the homeless cloud, away. Rome called the vassal-world her slave, And fetter'd princes hail'd as friends,— Yet, lo! in one remorseless grave Her crownless majesty descends; But o'er God's Church though eighteen hundred Years Have swept their wings of blast and blight, The Type unchanged there still appears Of all our Creeds deem true, and right. Empires and Kings, Dictators, Consuls, all,— Each, in due turn, has fill'd the scene, And then—left mere oblivion's pall Mantling the spot where they have been! But still, in order'd polity and law A Miracle of changeless truth, That Church, which Christ's own heralds saw, Is bright with apostolic youth. Her Government, in essence, still the same, By threefold Ministry inspired,— She firmly grasps her heaven-sprung claim, With deathless truth and grace attired. The classic Oracles of ancient time In broken whispers now are heard; Yet God's own authorship sublime Embodies, still, His perfect Word. Those Sacraments, which vital grace enclose, Pure as St. Paul the Churches gave Her Priesthood unto Faith bestows,— Sanction'd by Him, Who died to save. Still, at yon Temple-porch, the Font divine Is pregnant with mysterious power, When, seal'd with Her baptismal sign, New Births commence their dawning hour. Lo! where the Altar stands, devoutly kneeling, The hush'd adorers bend to share (O'erawed by more than mortal feeling) Incarnate God, in myst'ry there! And thus, she breathes her old liturgic spells Caught from the soul of Eastern prayer, Whose tone of supplication tells, Thy heart, St. John! is throbbing, there. Second Sunday after Trinity. “Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.” —Epistle for the Day. To Faith, this world a vision seems Whose architects are mocking dreams; Each dazzling spell to Her has died,— Christ and the Church alone abide. When hearts with heaven are not in tune, Shadows eclipse celestial noon, Through wild'ring paths of sin they roam, Far from The Cross, our central home. But night becomes a noontide-blaze When Sorrow lifts to Thee her gaze,— Of darken'd souls, The living Sun, Heaven of chaste hearts, Incarnate One! O'er every pang experience brings Some chant of hope Devotion sings, When in His Church The Lord appears And paints an Iris “There was a rainbow round about the throne.” —Rev. iv. 3 on our tears. And, come that “night,” when pulse and breath Ebb slowly into solemn death, Still, round the grave, disciples hymn Songs which entrance the Seraphim. Breathe, Harmonist Divine! inspire And tune our spirit's broken lyre, Till, wakened by Thy magic word, Floats music from each hidden chord. For grace holds God's creative spell, And miracles within it dwell O'er flesh-born anguish ever soaring; And tearful Souls, whom men disown, To priests in heaven Compare Rev. i. 6 with Rev. vi. 11. are deeply-known And watch'd by Angels, when adoring. Third Sunday after Trinity. “All of you be subject one to another, and clothed with humility.” —Epistle for the Day. No Christians have a Christ-like heart, Except their moral tone When call'd to bear life's bitter part, Recall Emanuel's own. Meek charity, that master-grace The peerless type of heaven, Oh, let it from thy creed displace What cannot say,—“forgiven!” Nor ever let the sun go down Upon thine inward ire: They cannot wear a Saviour's crown Whom love doth not inspire. Pure Lord of lowliness, and love! Thus, make Thy model dear To all who live for thrones above, By bearing crosses, here. Thy meekness hath its own reward, Calm blessings line its path; Without,—it keeps celestial guard, Within,—what peace it hath! The proud are poor, 'mid all the gold Ambition's grasp obtains; The meek are rich, though none behold The beauty of their gains. No acres may to them belong, No scenes of garish pleasure,— But yet they chant a mental song O'er Truth's divinest treasure. Then, Lord of gentleness, watch Thou For ever at our side, And, when we mark Thy wounded brow, Abhorr'd be human pride! Fourth Sunday after Trinity. “The sufferings of this present time.” —Epistle for the Day. A silent pang, a tearless woe, A mystic sorrow none can see, Haunts the cold depths of heart below In many a child of Misery, Whose face is silver'd with a radiant smile, Making the gay world think, that all is glad, the while! And shades of calm dejection brood And hover round the unvoic'd mind Of men, whose thinking solitude Is unreveal'd to human-kind;— Though seen by worldlings in their outer-life, God and the Angels scan alone their mental strife. The blood-red shadows of The Cross Their inward visions daily view, Who count that gain an impious loss Which is not to their Master true: Earth, scene, and time from Him derive a spell, Shading existence o'er with hues no words can tell! It is not, that some morbid dream, Or, sickliness of selfish thought Has made our orb of being seem With God-concealing darkness fraught;— All which Heaven made, their creed divine can own And hail redeeming Love on vast creation's throne. But sin, and grave, and guilt, and tears, And creedless hearts of crime are found; And wither'd hopes and warning fears Darken the brightest mood around; While, yearnings for the Infinite and Pure Far from this fading world their wingèd thoughts allure. The infant smile of new-born Day And choral joy of wave and wind May symbolise each impulse gay, That quickens in the happy mind,— But, souls exist, who in life's gladdest hour Are strangely overruled by some depressing Power. E'en in the charm of social rooms, When rings the laugh, and loud the glee, Oft do they feel a sense of tombs Subdue them, oh, how mournfully! And in the pealing mirth of marriage-bells Can hear those under-tones which sound like fun'ral-knells. And, they have feelings none can know, Tremors and thrills, no words define, Transcending all the mimic woe In painter's hue, or poet's line:— The Grave, the Judgment, and Eternity, By prophesy of soul their prescient natures see! And oft, with such depression blends An aching sense, how all departs, Or, in some fever-vision ends,— Men worship with impassion'd hearts; While, bitterly before The Cross, they rue How much of barter'd life has been to heaven untrue! Then, gaze not with ungentle eye, Nor coldly speak, nor harshly think Of those who heave the unheard sigh, And in their bosom'd darkness sink Down to despair,—in some benighted mood When baffled faith endures a more than solitude! Heroes, and Saints, and Martyrs learn From perill'd moments, dark as these, A deeper lore than men discern Who only live, blind sense to please:— The tears of Jesus on the Church's heart For them have left a trace, they would not see depart! Dejection is indeed sublime, When thus on wings of faith we rise, And, soaring out of space and time, Converse with Angels in the skies; And in yon realm, where Love incarnate reigns, That Jubilee rehearse, which breaks all mortal chains. Fifth Sunday after Trinity. “Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous.” —Epistle for the Day. The haughty coldness of inhuman Creeds May scorn Compassion, shedding tears, And blandly pouring over sorrow's needs Those genial tones which soften fears; And, Science may to selfishness ascribe What soft-eyed Pity for the wretched feels; But, heaven-born Virtue bears the heathen gibe, Nor checks the tear that from compassion steals. Behold the wisest, bravest, and the best, The lofty-hearted, firm, and free, On whose proud name an empire's glories rest, Who guide the Land, and guard our Sea,— No leaden calm of unimpassion'd mind Their boast has been, or proved them brave; But all pure links, connecting kind with kind,— They deem'd them holy, and beyond the grave! Men are not wise, because they cannot weep, Nor basely soft, because they sigh When those tear-fountains in true hearts that sleep, Awake, and dim the sternest eye. The sainted heroes, canonised by time, And martyr'd hosts, who burn'd or bled,— The wide Earth doth not deem them less sublime Because they soothed the sad, or mourn'd the dead! The perfect God, though passionless as pure, Hath symbolised His awful Name By deep emotions, which the heart allure, And bend the Will before His claim:— He speaks not only in the whirlwind-tone, But, with the calm of cooling eve; Gen. iii. 8. And, oft holds back the thunders of His Throne That dreadless minds may love Him, and believe. Sixth Sunday after Trinity. “As dying, and, behold! we live.” —2 Cor. vi. 9. “Dead unto sin, alive unto God.” —Epistle for the Day. A dying body, with a deathless soul Which is an undivided whole Not to be tomb'd in that sepulchral clay Where flesh abides the Judgment-day,— Such is the burden of existence now, More wondrous far than lips avow! Thus, life in death, and death in life, are we, Victims of time, yet charter'd with eternity! Fetter'd to earth by chains of flesh, we live, With destined organs, doom'd to give Fruition to all faculties which bind The outer-world to inner mind. Creation's Laws with elemental sway Encircle us, by night and day; And, thus condition'd, human Bodies rise To that due stature healthy growth supplies. But, soon our culminating point is gain'd, Where, full-toned Manhood once attain'd, The gray-hair'd weakness of the flesh gives token The bloom of life is inly broken; Decays, dejections, and ten thousand signs Reveal, how mortal flesh declines, While creeping Age with stealthy foot comes on, Telling the thoughtful heart, that Youth is gone! But, in the soul, parenthesis, nor pause Impedes those everlasting laws Whereby accretions round the Spirit grow, Which ripen it, for weal, or woe; Whose pulse of consciousness for ever plays Triumphant o'er all flesh-decays: Change, scene, and circumstance, and Man, Help to prolong what our first breath began— And that is, character!—which cannot die, But forms its own eternity; The self-creation of our choosing will, Preferring good, or seeking ill; Where heaven and hell in principle begin, According as there reigns within The flesh-born Adam, or, that spirit-grace Emanuel purchased to renew our race. Behold, a contrast! Faith may call sublime:— The body bends to laws of time; But spirit lives an undecaying life, With seeds of its hereafter rife; And, more than awful seems our sleepless Mind Which thus empowers redeem'd mankind,— Destined to feel, with guilt or glory fraught, And think for ever, with increasing thought! Seventh Sunday after Trinity. “The gift of God is eternal life.” —Epistle for the Day. Eternity! eternity! Though shadowless Thou art, Thy mystic presence faith can see Imaged within the heart,— Thus mirror'd by the prescient mind Whose felt hereafter awes The soul with influence, undefined By reason's formal laws. Eternity! thou haunt and home Of worship, hope, and fear, To Thee our inmost feelings roam Far from this earth-bound sphere:— Attracted by some hidden spell That issues from thy centre, A heaven we form, or frame the hell Unpardon'd souls must enter. Eternalised for weal, or woe!— Such is the doom of Man; Lord, teach us what to Grace we owe In that redemption-plan, Where guilt and sin, alike subdued, A perfect ransom meet, And hymns of holy gratitude Circle the Mercy-seat. Eternity! pale thought would dread On Thee to dwell alone, Apart from what th' Incarnate said Who rules our spirit-throne,— That where He is, the Church shall be Incorp'rate with Her Lord: Believing which, love welcomes thee Unshrouded by His Word. Thus, 'mid the aching wounds of time, Eternity a balm Breathes on the soul of Faith sublime, Centred in inward calm. Earth, space, and sense,—what seem they all To Saints, who heaven-ward soar And Him their worshipp'd Treasure call, Matt vi. 21. Whom Seraphim adore? Thou Giver of celestial good! Our everlasting Way, In Whom the holy Church hath stood Secure beyond decay, Waft from Thy viewless mercy-throne Spells of attractive grace, That, more and more, true saints may own This earth no dwelling-place. Heb. xi. 13. Our spirit-clime, our father-land Blooms where Emanuel reigns, And souls who this can understand Surmount all time-born pains: Angelic Watchers round them throng, Stern death is mild release, And Christ, the Stronger than the strong, Luke xi. 21. Their paradise, and peace. Eighth Sunday after Trinity. “It ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye, through the spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.” —Epistle for the Day. The world we see, and what we are, Illustrates that accordance due Which reigns, from insect up to star, And hallows all we feel, or do,— If thus our hearts delight to prove How faculties their objects find, And render life a hymn of love To Him, who hath both worlds combined. But, still there is a craving force In appetites to sense allied, Which nature, in its noblest course, Hath never to the brim supplied; Though charm'd and fed, they are not “fill'd,” But, fever'd oft with discontent; The cry for “more!” no joy hath still'd,— Unrest is with fruition blent. Though sumless orbs of beauty roll In burning magic through the sky, When mortal gaze commands the whole For brighter longs the asking eye! And, when we hear the tones that make The sweetest heaven that sound can bring, Melodious thirst they do not slake For some diviner murmuring. But, while both eye and ear demand What no imperfect Sense enjoys, Spirits, who under grace expand, A bliss partake that never cloys,— The bliss of hung'ring more and more That “righteousness” may aye dispense To sainted Hearts an added store Of purer calm and innocence: Behold! a hunger, and a thirst Which God Himself will soothe, and slake,— Ambition, by no fever cursed, And hope, no blighting sorrows break; Since, all those wingèd dreams that rise And flutter round the World divine, When heaven unveils its hidden prize Will find far more than dreams combine. Perennial glories, there, surpass All which seraphic Minds desire, Whom Angels with themselves may class, With fervid hearts, for God on fire: Of finite good alone who drinks,— Such water will be found in vain, And deeper want than passion thinks, Will soon enkindle thirst, again! John iv. 13. The man who lives by sensual dross May banquet on some hollow bliss, But yet, this truth his mind will cross,— I was not made for food, like this! Hunger and thirst, they make the all Which carnal wisdom can create, Whate'er encrowning words may call The glories which enwreathe the great. From joy to joy, the jaded sense Pursues each worn and wearied path; Though big may be this world's pretence, The mind eternal hunger hath:— Within, what flaming thirst there burns Which all polluting draughts excite, As passion, and supply, by turns, Fever the day, and fret the night! But, Grace forms those, to whom is given A glorious passion fix'd on God, Who breathe on earth the air of heaven, And tread the ground Emanuel trod; Their creed and conduct are combined By unity of peace and power, And mirror forth a saintly mind When darkness clouds the drearest hour. They must be tranquil, who are made By God, the guardian of the blest,— Of neither hell nor earth afraid, While panting for elysian rest: Their hunger is a holy thing, Their bosom-thirst a painful bliss; And lauding Seraphs shake the wing Of rapture o'er unrest like this! What is it?—but to nobly pine, More Christlike in true love to be, Or, body forth the Will divine, And heaven in all things ever see: Till rectitude a nature grow And holiness the spirit's breath,— And constant faith, in weal, or woe, Adorn our life, and vanquish death. Ninth Sunday after Trinity. “All our fathers ? were baptised unto Moses in the cloud. —Epistle for the Day. Mid awful gloom when Moses brought, The Law of fire and flame, Eternal Duty then was taught In dread Jehovah's name. But, radiantly descendeth now Deep wisdom from above; For mildness clothes His gracious brow, Whose ev'ry line is love! It was not thus, the God of old, Imperial Law declared, When round Him pealing thunders roll'd And red-wing'd lightnings glared. The people shudder'd, like a leaf, Amid their black'ning gloom; And Conscience saw no just relief Beyond, or in, the tomb. But, bright the contrast now appears, When the mild Lord of grace From the green Mount dispels all fears, By His benignant face. The breeze, soft lyrist of the spring, Was harping o'er the flowers; And humming bees upon the wing Enjoy'd their golden hours; A vernal radiance threw its gleam Of gladness o'er the hills; While, rich as love-tones in a dream,— The gushing of the rills. And, like the season, so the Word Was mild as Mercy's breath; No curse was in His counsel heard, Nor, doom of legal death. Humility and meekness were In hues of heaven array'd; And He, whose life was living prayer, Their perfect Type display'd. All mental grace, all moral gift, Whate'er men seek, or find, Is blasted,—if it proudly lift Or bloat, the conscious mind. Contingent, finite, from the dust, What Nothings are we all!— For in the tomb, the proudest must A worm his brother call. All pride becomes a fiendish spark Of hell, within the soul; And He who dreads that region dark, Abhors its least control. The poor in spirit,—blest are they Above the world who live; Their wisdom is to watch, and pray, And, like their Lord, forgive. Nor seek they for Ambition's wealth, Or sigh for world-applause; But, calm in sickness, as in health, To Heaven commit their cause. Tenth Sunday after Trinity. “He beheld the city and wept over it.” —Gospel for the Day. “Jesus wept.” —John xi. 35. Tears on the eyelids of the Son of God!— Almighty Weeper! let such grief-drops fall Full on meek Hearts, who, where Thy feet have trod, In faith can wander, and by prayer recall The hallowing spells which haunt that sacred time When Jesu wept, and tears became sublime. Thrice did He weep; and from such threefold-source A soothing charm the Church delights to draw, As on she travels her presdestined course In suff'ring meekness, or, in sainted awe,— Bearing His Cross; and, where The Master went, In calmness following, and with grief content. Whether, thine olive-shaded bowers of gloom Gethsemanè! adoring pilgrims seek, Where the dark preludes of His coming doom Convulsed The Saviour, till, with anguish weak,— He drew Love's angel from a throne of light By dread attraction, to endure that sight Of weeping blood-drops! and sustain his Lord: Or, if to Salem's guilty towers we hie, To hear the cadence of each knell-like word And mark the pathos of His pleading eye— Still, in fond unity of flesh we find One with our lot,—the Brother of mankind! But, if on earth more eloquent than all, A spot there be, where Man's sepulchral grief, Hush'd into prayer, may pensively recall A Balm celestial, which can bring relief— It is, when mourners in their meekness pray Beside that vision'd tomb, where Laz'rus lay. There, wept The God-Man! and with tears how true! Intensely-human, from the deeps of soul Wrung by compassion, and reveal'd to view, For Earth to know,—that not by false control, A christian Stoic in some iron hour Need stifle grief, by superhuman power. Oh, precious Tears!—significant of more Than quiet Mary, or quick Martha thought, Which flowed from Jesus, when His heart ran o'er In tides of feeling, with emotion fraught,— For ever and for ever, will dejected Awe Bend o'er that scene my weeping Saviour saw! Why wept He there, whose world-embracing mind Encircled Life, and Death, and Destiny, and Man? Far down, in sightless depths, all undivined, Dreader than faith can search, or reason scan— Perchance, His fountains of emotion lay When tears said more than lenient words could say? Was it, that forfeit-Eden's blighted doom, The sinning Adam, and the curse divine, Corruption, pain, the ever-yawning tomb, With all that guilt and anguish may combine,— Mirror'd by Christ, before His mental eye Pass'd in array, and thrill'd His heart, thereby? Or, did the crime of Judah's unbelief Weigh on His soul, prophetically sad, And summon visions, whose unworded grief No speaking vent but tear-born utt'rance, had? Or, some dread Future of our fallen race Then did the inward Eye of Jesu trace? No answer greets us!—men, nor Angels give Reply to what our yearning bosoms feel, When voiceless Aspirations stir and live And shadows of Hereafter round them steal, Who ponder o'er the infinite To-Come, And make eternity their spirit's home. Yet, Lord of souls! may Thy dejection teach Some hidden lore of heavenliness and love; And Thy sad brow, with sympathising reach, Bend o'er the hearts which most life's burden prove, And need the language of almighty tears To whisper, peace! and calm unchristian fears. Eleventh Sunday after Trinity. “Some are fallen asleep.” —Epistle for the Day. “Within the veil.” —Heb. vi. 19. A world there is, whose zone contains Secrets and shadows none can see Save God, whose boundless eye-glance reigns O'er time, and through eternity,— A Hades, where the holy Dead Are by commission'd Angels “The beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom.” —Luke xvi. 22. led. Two worlds, indeed, to us belong,— Matter and Mind to both relate; Each wields a charm o'er weak and strong, Which makes, or mars, our inward state: But that pure Orb, where spirits dwell, Hides, for the Saints, a master-spell. Behind this outer shell of Time, On which the ling'ring earth-stains lie, Wait viewless Glories, more sublime Than ever gleam'd on mortal eye; And, one day, they will rend the veil, And turn the boldest sceptic pale! Men talk, as if our world of sense, Of earth and sea, of moon and sun, Enclos'd Divine omnipotence, And were the whole His Hands have done!— Cities and homes, and haunts and ways Seem to absorb their sensual gaze. Yet, is God's inner-world, unseen, More wondrous far than all we view; And, though night-shadows intervene, On faith it acts supremely true: While from that world dread Nature draws Her vital powers, and plastic laws. Elect of heaven! like saints of old, A Samson of the spirit be! Burst from the bondage which would hold That sightless Region back from thee; And through those veils, which round thee fall, Behold the secret All in All! Thus, not alone when Death reveals To soul unbodied, Truths and Things A carnal mind from man conceals,— Will come that world God's poet Vide Ps. xvi, c. sings; 'Tis present, now!—to hope and fear, Around, beneath, for ever near. God, and His Angels, there abide, Acting by ways we cannot know, When fiends of Darkness may have tried To plunge our doom in endless woe: And thrills of awe, and throbs of dread, How often have they round us spread! And, to that Spirit-world have gone Those living-dead our hearts enshrine, Whose saintly brows to look upon,— Dark earth itself made half-divine! Yes, they are in that Orb of rest Where none can sin, and all are blest. Ah! who can tell, how near they come, And hover nigh, on soundless wing; Or haunt, unseen, Love's peopled home Where faith for Christ is suffering?— Formless, but still, in soul complete, The dead can with the living meet. Hence, walk with awe the realm of sense, For, in God's secret world we are; And from this last doth He dispense That grace which rules our bosom-war, When Mind and Matter, Faith and Sight, Contend for their contrasted right. Around us, Principles and Powers, In viewless action, work and wind; And through all circumstance and hours They touch the heart, or tone the mind; And, oft when souls are unaware, Commingle with their praise and prayer. That inner-World! though hid from Man, With what a burst of beaming life Hereafter will unveil its plan, And be with rays millennial rife, While risen Saints and Martyrs throng, And chant Creation's easter-song! “Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust ? The earth shall cast out the dead. —Isa. xxvi. 19. Twelfth Sunday after Trinity. “He hath done all things well; He maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.” —Gospel for the Day. Celestial Birth! almighty Child! In human semblance undefiled, By Prophets vision'd, born to be The Lord of man's eternity,— Thou Sun of souls! embodied Light! Within Thy beams the world is bright; Where'er they smile, an Eden blooms, And Earth forgets her myriad tombs. Thy Voice is heard—and Anguish dies, The Dead awake, and greet the skies; Lo! Blindness melts in healing rays, And mute lips ope in hymns of praise; The famish'd on Thy bounty feed, While myriads at Thy summons speed Redeem'd from woe, and sin, and pain, To see the lost restored again:— “Peace on earth, to Man, good will, Let the skies our anthem fill!” “Awake, awake, thou ransom'd Earth! And, blooming with a second birth, In loveliness, awake, and shine, Thy King is come, salvation thine!— The winds are rock'd in holy rest, The waves asleep on Ocean's breast, And beautiful the boundless calm O'er nature spread, like midnight-balm; For lo! the manger where He lies, A world-redeeming Sacrifice; The Promised, since the world began, To live, and die, for guilty Man. “Again, again, the anthem swell! For heaven shall burst the gates of hell! A vision of prophetic years Which travel on through toil and tears, In all unroll'd, in wild extent, Like ocean's surging element: But, soon that darken'd scene hath past, And rules the Lord, in light, at last! The sunbeams of a sabbath-day Around adoring myriads play; From north to south, from east to west, All pangs are hush'd, all hearts at rest: Pacific homes, Atlantic isles, Far as the vast creation smiles,— The rudest spot which man can own, Shall hail Messiah on His throne; And lauding souls, by land and sea, One Altar build, O God! to Thee, While human angels ?????????. —Luke xx. 36. round it throng To chant the sempiternal song,— “Peace on earth, to Man, good will, Let the skies our anthem fill!” Thirteenth Sunday after Trinity. “Blessed are the eyes which see the things, ye see!” —Gospel for the Day. As certain also of your own poets, have said.” —Acts xvii. 28. Living masters of the lyre! Ye who feel celestial fire, Priests, whose sacrifice are songs, Poets!—unto you belongs Privilege on earth to be, (If your harps to heaven are true,) Laureates of eternity, Chanting more than Homer knew. Magic, mystery, and might, Such as charm our earth-bound sight, From the ocean, sky, and air Kindle poetry and prayer, When, by inspiration fraught Pure as God and genius bring,— Bards in Nature's realm have sought What no sensual harpers sing. Hue, and harmony, and grace Featured on Creation's face; Beauty, grandeur, love and light, Beaming Day and dark-brow'd Night,— To the Poets of the Lord Sacramental ever prove, Touch'd by that transforming Word, Binding earth with heaven above. Signs and symbols Nature hath Scatter'd o'er her mystic path, Like a wordless Bible, preaching What no Science can be teaching While, unread in heavenly lore, She but scans what He has made,— Seldom yearning to adore God in His Own work array'd. If in realms of heart and home Fancy-dreams delight to roam, Tinging all with hues of song Which to poet-worlds belong, Let your lyric numbers roll With a cadence pure and high,— Chanting His divine control Watching man with sleepless eye. But, how dread your boundless loss! If beneath th' almighty Cross, Strains of more melodious worth Than attuned by choral Earth,— Kindle no enraptur'd spell To the praise of Him Who died, Vanquishing both death and hell On that Cross when crucified. Priests of melody, and song, Unto Christ your harps belong In Whose glories faith can see Hopes which fill eternity!— Nature, Providence, and Grace, Threefold while to man they prove, Blend in One, to Whom we trace All they hold of light and love. Fourteenth Sunday after Trinity. “Walk in the Spirit.” —Epistle for the Day. By heavenly likeness hearts discern The secrets most divine; Ps. xxv. 14. Since, as we live, so much we learn Of Thee, O God! and Thine. Those inward eyes of purity By which the mind beholds Ideal truths sin cannot see, When God Himself unfolds,— Unless we have them, vain is all The science taught within; Our creed, the World may holy call, But, such proud wealth is sin. And here, behold that peerless Law Proving the Gospel's worth, Beyond what sage or poet saw When most he soar'd from earth;— That Law is,—purity intense, A chastity divine, A sacred glow of innocence, That keeps the heart a shrine,— A shrine of holiness and power Whence praise and prayer arise, To seek what charms the dreadest hour Demanding sacrifice. Then, weigh thy heart! disciple, keep That central pulse of life, Which even through mysterious sleep Can throb with sin, and strife. Unfathom'd, ever-active spring Of deathless thought, and will! To which time, sense, and motion bring Perpetual good, or ill, By Thee we live, and love, and hate, The inward Man art thou, Thy nature dooms our final state,— And that, is forming, now! Oh! watch we then, with jealous eyes That world, where God alone Jer. xvii. 10. Searches the secret thoughts which rise Like shades before His Throne. Fifteenth Sunday after Trinity. “Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink.” —Gospel for the Day. A passion for imperfect good!— Behold, what fosters pride: While God Himself is thus withstood, No idols are denied. But, woulds't thou like the sainted be?— From finite good retire; And in the depths of Deity Thy soaring thoughts inspire. In humbleness of mind, believe That true contentment reigns,— Whose pleasures on the conscience leave No shadows and no stains. Retreat then, O, earth-fever'd soul! From broken cisterns fly; For, couldst thou drink their blissful whole, They still would leave thee dry. The utmost in all creatures fails A perfect lull to bring; Since, when our purest dream prevails, Unrest keeps murmuring! Low as some weanèd child to lie Before Emanuel's feet, And in the guidance of His eye To find a safe retreat,— Like Him, to crucify the will, As merciful and meek, And each just orb of duty fill Whene'er we act, or speak,— Be this, disciple of the Cross! The glory of thine aim; And, though on earth thou reap the loss, In heaven, perceive thy gain. But, saith He not, that here below Beatitudes begin For all, whose hearts by meekness grow Above the self of sin? A kingdom of the mind is theirs While yet on earth they bide; And heaven seems dawning through the prayers God's Spirit hath supplied. Celestial Dove of grace! descend, Thy gentleness impart, Till faith shall build the “Sinner's Friend” A temple in her heart. Sixteenth Sunday after Trinity. “A dead man carried out ? weep not.” —Gospel for the Day. “He being dead, yet speaketh.” —Heb. xi. 4. Softer than moonlight o'er dim landscape stealing, Is the faint presence of that mystic feeling When Voices come, like resurrection-breath, Ton'd with the tenderness of childhood's truth, Or, touch'd with grief, or glad with glowing youth, Serenely wafted from the world of death. And now, as in the sepulchre of Time, Toll'd to his grave by midnight's fun'ral chime, Sinks the dead Year, we lift our hearts to Thee, Timeless and changeless, an almighty Now, Before Whose will the universe shall bow,— The sightless Fountain of eternity! Let tombs have tongues; and eloquence be heard By listening conscience, more than spoken word, While to the Present speaks the awful Past; The longest-dead becomes a living voice, Hebrews xi. 4. Whose wisdom cries,—“Make God thy glorious choice, And with the peerage of the Saints be class'd!” And, as with Abel, so can heaven-born Mind Breathe through the Church, and still instruct mankind From age to age eternal in its tone;— Buried in flesh, but mentally alive The battle-words of sainted Heroes strive, And summon earth to be the Saviour's own! Martyrs are miracles, whose voice controls The grand episcopate of blood-priced souls, Long as the clock of Time shall strike the hours;— Though dead, they live, though dumb, they wield a speech, Whose tongueless accents unto conscience reach, Ring through the soul, and rouse its dormant powers. Peter and Paul,—oh, have they ever died, Who, to the death, proclaimed The Crucified? Preach they not still, with rhetoric sublime, The Earth, their pulpit, and their audience, Man, Far as God's diocess extends its plan,— Sermons whose texts are oracles for Time? Confessors, too, and champions for their Lord, Eternity embalms each dying word They uttered forth, from dungeon, stake, or fires; Their tombs are altars, where religion prays, And votive youth may consecrate its days To deeds and darings, such as heaven inspires. Baptised ambition is a god-like thing; And wafts the soul, as on seraphic wing, High o'er the selfish dreams of world-renown,— For Christ to speak, when dust and darkness close Round some dead martyr in his deep repose, And pales the lustre of an Angel's crown. And fameless dwellers, in some village cot, By heaven remember'd, though on earth forgot, With saintliness may so inspire a home, That, greenly o'er them while the turf-grave lies, Their pure example preaches from the skies Truths, which o'erawe the erring when they roam. And ah! how oft may voice maternal be Like music, breathing Love's eternity, Heard by the heart, in night-dreams of the dead And so, immortalise with tender power The vanish'd haunts of childhood's vernal hour, That age forgets the cycles which have fled. Nor, can the meanest Lazarus who dies, Unwept, unknown, unwatch'd by human eyes, An outcast-weed on earth's sepulchral wild,— Speechless remain; because, some home, or heart Took from his life a portion and a part, That made it purer, or the more defiled. And, warning Guides, whose wisdom breathed of love, And spake below, what Angels think above, How from the tomb their deathless words ascend! Alive,—we heard them oft with rude cold ear; But now, we prize them as sublimely-dear, Till the heart echoes with the name of “friend.” Nor, is the Pastor sermonless, though dumb: Still from his grave may preaching magic come Far more resistless than his living breath; And truths, that once were braved with impious mock, Or, fell like sunbeams on a herbless rock, Divinely sway him,—now they speak from death! Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity. “There one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called.” —Epistle for the Day. Ages and empires, thrones, and throneless kings, Science, and art, with all the Poet sings Of grief or glory, pomp or state, depart,— But Thou, fond Mother of the faithful, art On earth a Miracle of during might!— Pleading to Heaven for sacramental right; Though rent by tyrant-wrong, and stained by sin, True in thy centre to the Christ within. Speak, Parent! then, to each rebellious child, And homeward “Fetch them home, blessed Lord.” —Collect for Good Friday. fetch the fearful, and defiled; Cry to dread Sacrilege,—God's wealth restore! And melt stern Faction, till it “sin no more.” Thine is a Voice, would man but hear it well, With more than music in its deepest spell, Touching the soul through all its myriad chords With love-tones, caught from dying martyr-words. Soul of the saints! celestial Paraclete! Open faith's inward ear, and make it meet To listen ever, with a child-like awe, And hear Thy language in the Church's law. In fast and festival, or frequent prayer, Breathe we, O Lord! Thy temple's solemn air; Bow the bold heart, or, bend the suppliant knee And thrill man's time with God's eternity. Whate'er the truth our ancient Mother speak, To curb the sinful, or sustain the weak, To calm or chasten, to absolve or bind, Sooth the wild heart, or help the wearied mind,— Be ours the listening soul, and loving will, By faith to learn what duty must fulfil, E'en when to Discipline pale Conscience yields, And proves by penance what the power She wields. For, oh! her Voice, maternally the same, Comes to each sainted heart with hallowed claim, Speaking, at once, of holiness and heaven, Yet, ever warbling with that word,—“forgiven!” Church of our God! all life to Thee pertains, Its hopes and fears, its pleasures and its pains,— From dawning reason, down to very death Thy words are quicken'd by Emanuel's breath. “He breathed on them, and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye retain,” &amp;c. —John xx. 22. Believe, and do,—be this our wisdom all, While through the Church we hear the Spirit call, And feel, as onward years to glory run, The accent varies, but her Voice is one. Eighteenth Sunday after Trinity. Grant thy people grace ? with pure hearts and minds to follow Thee the only God.” —Collect for the Day. As local space the body holds, So God the mind contains; And who can dare, what He enfolds To mar with impious stains? He dwells in us, and we in Him, The Temple of all souls! And pure, as prostrate seraphim Be all which Heaven controls. For, if the ground by Moses trod With sanctity was fill'd, When erst the flaming bush of God The o'erawed patriarch still'd, Sublimer far, than thought can trace, Is He, the all-divine,— In Christ reveal'd, our dwelling-place Ps. xc. 1; Acts xvii. 28. And Soul-embracing Shrine. Eternal spring of purity! Descend, propitious Dove; From heart-corruption make us free, By turning law to love. The blessèd are the pure, indeed, And wretched, the defiled; In whose dark bosom dwell and breed Lone passions, fierce and wild. By likeness only, souls can see The glories heaven contains; But minds that nurse impurity Would feel them worse than pains. For, purity is heaven below, And sin, the hell of man, While all eternity will show— Will be—what time began! Rev. xxii. 11. Nineteenth Sunday after Trinity. “Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another.” —Epistle for the Day. Base passions are the serpents of our soul, That bite, and sting to bitterness the heart, And, where they wield their unsubdued control, Angels and Grace from that foul den depart! But, when these hearts atoning Blood makes white, Soft o'er our spirit broods the mystic Dove; Like the hush'd band who watch'd their sheep by night, A “peace on earth,” replies to peace above. Then, like our Lord, magnanimous and meek, Move where we may, our end is still the same; Firm to Their vow, in all we do, or speak, Our lives embody the baptismal name. No longer, as the Lord of Hosts, and War, Doth God the glories of His will unfold; But, radiant as the lull of evening star As Lord of Peace His pard'ning smile behold. Isa. xlvii. 4; Exod. xv. 3; 2 Thess. iii. 16. And, saints on earth, resemble Him, in heaven, Who help to circulate the calm of love, And, by imparting what to each is given, Prove their high lineage from the Lord above. Makers of Peace! your task divine complete, Two sever'd hearts in unity restore; And bid mild harmonies of friendship meet In homes to rule, where they have reign'd before. For ah! how mournful, when two friends depart Wider and wider unto distance stern, While each one holds the arrow at his heart And, but for pride, would lovingly return. And, more than beauteous is a god-like word, Breathing soft balm o'er that tempestuous hour When some dark madness of the soul hath stirr'd, Or, poison'd nature with envenom'd power.— To stand between, like mediating Grace And make two alienated minds agree, Sublimes our being, and reveals the trace Of true adoption into Deity. And He, in Whom all unities reside, Celestial Fount from whence communions flow, Husband of Souls, who took His chosen Bride And call'd it by the name of, Church, below,— How can we love Him, if we dare to rend By the rude harshness of sectarian will That Mystic Body, where all members blend And, by their harmony, due office fill! How can we love Him, if our “Church” we choose As pride, and reason and presumption sway?— Defend us, Grace! from Babylonian views, And teach us, not to argue, but, obey. Be ours submission, Mary-like and meek, Who love the path anointed martyrs trod; Learning to crucify, what most we seek, When Self would image a sectarian God. Twentieth Sunday after Trinity. “Filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart, to the Lord.” —Epistle for the Day. No Sabbath keep they in their praise Who ring the heavens with glory-lays,— Those lauding Seraphim, that ever cry, “Thou holy, holy, holy, Lord on high!” Ye Stars of Jesus! wingèd Creatures Out-beaming all bright fancy features, Would that our worship, like your own might be, And time, an echo of eternity! Oh, waft ye from love-chorded lyres Some choral fragment, which inspires Adoring ecstacies of song and soul, Till, high as heaven our hallelujahs roll! From nightless regions, “There shall be no night there.” —Rev. xxi. 25. where ye chant Hosannahs loud and jubilant, May He, Who over saint and seraph reigns, Kindle in us some Christ-adoring strains, Which on the harp of holy Thought Quiver, with awed devotion fraught, And tremble up to heaven, in tones which speak,— The soul is willing, though the song be weak. Praise is the purest breath of love Worship can waft to Christ above;— Such, Eden's bower from sinless Adam heard When God, within him, first devotion stirr'd. But, litanies from man declare Weakness, and want,—confessing there, How guilty passions have our nature stain'd And grasp'd the throne where once Jehovah reign'd. And hence, to your unsilenced lays Bright Choristers! our spirit raise, That faith may listen, and your anthems learn, Till echoing earth to heaven the strain return. And, now abide, let truth declare, Confession, praise, and contrite prayer; But of that three, the greatest far is found,— Praise to our God, by man and Angel crown'd! In praise, the least, in prayer, the most Our selfish aims can be, and boast:— Glory divine our lauds alone confess, But litanies, ourselves most chiefly bless. With lives of prayer, and lips of praise, So pass we our appointed days, Since half the Angel but commences now, And woe and weariness o'ershade the brow. But, wait awhile, and we shall sing, Melodious Angels! round our King, And sweep that harp, no quiring Seraph can,— Whose chords by faith are tun'd for pardon'd Man. Twenty-First Sunday after Trinity. “Strong in the Lord ? we wrestle against principalities, against powers, against the Rulers of the Darkness of this world.” —Epistle for the Day. Though weaponless, to man, the Church appears, Yet, in her weakness is she mighty, still! And civil Tyrants have confess'd their fears, When they approach'd Her, with consummate ill, Finding, she hath a mystery and might, Or, secret glory, which escapes their sight. Money, and men, with subtlety and sway Adjusted and array'd,—with these blind worldlings move Whate'er impediments obstruct the way Bewilder'd dreams of wild ambition love; But Christ's own Col. i. 18. Body!—there, they face a foe Who seems to strengthen on the rock of woe! But, whence th' enduring grandeur of this spell, This obstinate sublime of love and law,— Is, to mere earth-gods, more than speech can tell, A something more than State-craft ever saw! Hence, from collision with such magic, they Shrink and retire, like darkness from the day. Oh! had their conscience but a creed divine, Church of The Lord! how soon would all be clear, And prove what myst'ries fill that Ark of Thine, Which daunt the tyrants, when they Exod. iii. 5. draw too near, Since faith, not sight, a true perception gains Of that high region where the heaven-King reigns. Twenty-Second Sunday after Trinity. “Ye are of God, little children.” —1 John iv. 4. ‘He who hath begun a good work in you, will perform it, until the day of Jesus Christ.” —Epistle for the Day. Children, to faith, are sacred Things, Tokens and types of purity Under the Church's ever-brooding wings,— When reverence their souls can see Baptised in God's Own trinitarian Name, And heritors of more than Angels claim. Yet, little can this Age of art, Of science, culture, and proud skill, In that deep mystery partake a part Prophetic Conscience should fulfil,— Watching young souls, which ripen into prayer, Foster'd by hidden beams of heaven-light, there. But, in our wonder-crowded earth No marvels can so much reveal, As infant-spirits,—when, through second birth, They upward into glory steal, Through sin and sorrow, weakness, toil, and strife Ascending God-ward, with celestial life. Sun, moon, and star, and sea and land, The elements, and all they hold, Have nothing in them so divinely-grand As what infantine hearts enfold, As, day by day, some charms of secret grace Dawn into light, which Love alone can trace. Precious as pure, the warbled hymn! The first faint buds of oral praise; And, like deep glances caught from Cherubim, The looks devoted infants raise When, gently lifting their entrancèd eye, They worship Jesus, and believe Him, nigh. Fancy and feeling, ne'er alone, In childhood's depth and dawn can view Those higher instincts, which the Church may own And in them hail His presence true, Who gives to nature, what no Flesh imparts,— The vestal pureness of regen'rate hearts. And, holy as parental love To earth and time must ever be, Unless anointed by a grace above, And so, by faith from sin set free,— What is it, but idolatrous delight In mortal good, with God kept out of sight? Child-loving Lord! from Thee we learn A sacredness to childhood clings, And, in Thine incarnation can discern What mercy unto manhood brings,— When the dread Second of the Godhead deign'd To suffer here, where sin and Satan reign'd. The laver of regen'rate life From whence baptismal waters flow, Saviour! forbid that our unhallow'd strife Should change it to a fount of Woe,— By impious mocks, whose doubting tones repel Man from his God, and make earth nearer hell. Still do Thine arms of wreathing love Encircle infants, as of old, When soaring hearts survey Thy throne above, And on that Glory-seat behold The Virgin-born, whose sacramental Word “Suffer little children to come unto me,” &amp;c. Matt. xix. 30. Round every cradle by the Church is heard. Twenty-Third Sunday after Trinity. “Jesus Christ ? shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.” —Epistle for the Day. The dimness of the holy dawn Round earth and sky was stealing, And silence on the shaded lawn Lay, like a solemn feeling; But still, her watch, much-loving “Her many sins are forgiven; for she loved much.” Mary kept, Gazed on the tomb, and while she gazed,—she wept! Oh! Saviour-God, and where didst Thou Thy viewless Person hide, When first Thy resurrection-brow, By mortals undescried, Was bared triumphant in the breeze of heaven, While throbb'd creation like a heart forgiven? Who saw Thee with refulgent grace Rise from Thy rocky tomb? Or, look'd upon Thine awing face Clad with celestial bloom?— Scripture is dumb: enough for Faith to read, “The Lord is risen,” and alive, indeed! Not when sabbatic rest began Our new-born earth to bless, And all was eloquent to man Of light and loveliness Was such a moment for mysterious thought Like this,—with superhuman meaning fraught. By virtue of our risen Lord Stern Death himself shall die; And, charter'd by His changeless Word, Victorious saints may cry Their “jubilate” o'er each human grave Open'd by Love, which died the world to save. Yet, pensive, pale, and all alone The weeping Mary bends, And, wond'ring o'er the vanish'd stone, Her clouded eye-glance sends Into the grave, with fearful hope to find If still her Lord be there, in death enshrin'd. But hark! angelic whispers sound, Angelic Forms appear; And gleam the sepulchre around Glories,—which make her fear! While each, with tone like music's lulling fall, “Woman! why weepest thou?” is heard to call. “My Lord is taken hence away,”— Such the sad answer given; And beams her eye with tearful ray Beheld by God in heaven; Then, pensively uplifts her downcast head, Moved by the glide of some advancing tread. There, shrouded in serene disguise, The Lord of spirits stands! But sorrow dims her yearning eyes, Nor on His nail-pierced Hands Nor wounded Feet, that lonely weeper saw The sacramental prints of Love and Law. So was it then; so is it now Redeemer of all forfeit souls!— Our creeds Thy Presence here avow, But blinding sense controls That inner-vision, which can realise A living Saviour in some holy guise. Near, but unview'd; when seen, unknown; His very accent strange! O Mary, art thou faithless grown, Does grief thy soul derange? “Why weepest thou?”—can such true speech recall No thrilling mem'ries of thine All-in-All?” Alas, how often in some hour of pain Dejected spirits fail To see Emanuel by the tomb, Where most His words prevail: The earth-clods mutter with so dread a tone, A Saviour's “weep not” seems for ever flown! But Christ hath yet a deeper spell, A breathing from His heart,— A word that none could speak so well As when Those pure lips part And whisper “Mary!” with resistless love, That once absolved her for the realms above. And how her spirit's inmost chord That well-known “Mary” thrill'd! Since, who could breathe it, like the Lord Whose heaven-toned accent fill'd Each hidden chamber of the heart within, And smote pale conscience with remember'd sin! O Thou, the Root of risen life, If, Mary-like, we fail To greet The Voice that lulls our strife When grief and guilt prevail,— Deepen Thy tones, till Love's melodious claim Shall seem to vibrate with our very name. “I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.” —Is. xlv. 3. Twenty-Fourth Sunday after Trinity. “If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.” —Gospel for the Day. Shrined in a sacrament, my Saviour lives By all save heaven-eyed faith unview'd; And there, beneath anointed symbols gives Himself, to be our spirit-food: Thus by that eucharist our hearts may see Dwells in Shechinah there incarnate Deity. Oh! that prevail'd within my spirit now Such voiceless awe of soul profound, As once o'ercame me, when, with shaded brow, Kneeling the Altar-rails around,— A love which works by supernat'ral law Proved to adoring mind, what science never saw! For, cloth'd by matter, comes almighty Grace Curtain'd in secrecy of spells, With feeding mystery to form our race By nourishment, that inly dwells; Till, strengthen'd thus by elements divine,— This Manna of the Church may with our souls combine. Yes, 'twas a moment, tender, awful, deep, When first a virgin faith received Mystical Food, which made it live, and weep; While, fill'd with prayer, the soul believed Under the symbols which accost the sense An omnipresent Christ Himself doth there dispense. No cold memorials, cautiously defined, Dead emblems for the carnal eye, Nor mere emotions to enflame the mind, In this dread Banquet they descry Who learn behind the shroud on God to gaze, And realise by faith far more than sight displays. In things Divine simplicity is strength When man becomes a little child; Learning that secret, all are taught, at length, Who keep the Symbol undefiled,— That not to mental force but meekest love Descend those heaven-born truths, which draw the soul above. The aching hunger of a foodless heart Famish'd by guilt and gnaw'd by sin, Is never soothed by what mere husks impart While conscience yearns for Christ within,— Not in the shade and shadow of a Name, But livingly bestow'd, and felt through all our frame. O Thou, of sacraments the hidden Seed, Incarnate Presence! working all, Eternal Nourisher in what we need When most for grace thy members call,— Open our hearts for Thine illapses true, As dawning flowers expand, to drink the vestal dew. Thyself we want!—not less, nor more we ask: Such is the Banquet souls require To fit them here to face life's burden'd task, And secretly such aids inspire That Christ internal may be form'd, and fill Each faculty men wield, with homage to His will. And, what a pang it wakes of with'ring dread When first Communion age recalls! Or when we realise the holy dead While faith before the Altar falls,— And think how chill'd these time-worn hearts can be, With soaring youth compared and young simplicity! Lord! grant a praying zeal, whose pureness glows With more than what from earth proceeds, That in Thine Eucharist, where grace o'erflows To meet our spirit's inmost needs,— Each hoar'd Communicant again may find In that high feast of heaven what once o'eraw'd his mind. We are not wise, because experience learns What crafty worldliness imparts, Or, mere acuteness through proud culture learns By hollow intercourse of hearts: For sacred wisdom is a gift divine No spirit can produce, except, O Lord! 'tis Thine. They learn the Saviour best, who love Him most; Taught by simplicity and prayer Man's true religion, which the Holy Ghost Shrines in that Church our creeds declare,— Whose truths enclose a sacramental plan For bringing heaven to earth, by weaning self from man. Twenty-Fifth Sunday after Trinity. “Israel out of the north country.” —Epistle for the Day. Sister of Scotland! lift thy grief-worn face, Arise, courageous be; Not gloom alone, but glory marks the trace Stern archives bear of thee; Of old, quiescence for thy strength has been,— But now, awake! and thrill the world's great scene. Widow'd of pomp and shorn of stately power Thy mitred Fathers are; But He, who seal'd with sanctifying dower Their consecration-prayer, Still to the church of Caledonia's clime Grants the true wealth of apostolic time,— A creed of principle! that Christ-born Thing With prowess calm and high, Which baffles hate and all harsh tyrants bring Fierce zeal to crucify:— True to God's covenant, thy martyr'd soul Faced the dread anguish, and absorb'd the whole. Thine was a trial, worse than battle-shock Like what Culloden saw; E'en the slow waste of man's consuming mock,— The bane and blight of Law, Whose with'ring cruelty of cold disdain Frets a fine spirit more than martyr's chain. For oh, when Persecution's rage appears In faggot, blood, and fire, Religion watches through applauding tears Faith's hero thus expire: Such death is grandeur; and each dying tone For truth becomes an everlasting throne. But, Scotland's Church in silent meekness bore Her pangs of buried grief; Unlike false Zeal which took the field of yore And fought for stern-relief; Wearied and worn, in exile far away, She wept, and worshipp'd in that awful day! Yet, not for Her hath poet struck the lyre Pure martyrdom to praise; Battle and blood can pæans loud inspire, But none could anguish raise,— Voiceless, intense, when hearts with pangs were wrung, By angels number'd, though by bards unsung. Sister of Scotland! 'twas indeed an hour Of agony and gloom,— Erastian hate and antichristian power Yearn'd to contrive a tomb, Where Church and Cross and sacramental Rite Should bear the blast of persecuting might. Then, was thy triumph! when thy Prelates stood, And drank the cup of woe:— Imprison'd, faint, in widowhood Thou didst not faith forego, But, bind the Cross still closer to thy breast, And follow paths a Saviour's feet had press'd. For this, both Time and Truth shall laurel thee With wreaths of more than glory; And creedless Legislation blush to see The brand she wears in story,— Dreaming that mortal power a Church can make, And what Christ founded, impious Falsehood shake! E'en now may pilgrims from their southern home In glens of Scotland find Symbols and signs, where'er they haply roam, Which bring that age to mind When fierceness, clad in Cameronian form, Yell'd in the fray, and rous'd the bloody storm. Altar and Temple, plunder'd, rent, defiled, The scatter'd flock no more,— Bann'd from their soil, went husband, wife, and child To seek an alien-shore: While oft beneath the cutting winds of heaven Some infant to the Saviour's arms was given. “Cast down, but not destroy'd,” thou still art left Shrine of the hoary Past! Changeless in creed, although of power bereft By persecution's blast: And time-worn prayer-books by their tear-marks tell,— The hearts they solaced, learn'd to love them well. When Albion in barbaric darkness lay Cover'd with pagan-cloud, Thy sea-girt convent sent the primal ray Which broke Northumbria's shroud;— O'er Dane and Saxon pour'd celestial light And saved half Europe from sepulchral night. That wave-rock'd nursling of the Hebrides Whence thy first Abbot came, Hath islanded with grace the northern seas, And fill'd with more than fame The sacred gloom of that monastic Shrine, Where still some halo from the past is thine. Like wrecks of glory, mute and mournful fade Cathedral tower and spire; And calm dejection haunts each cloister-glade Where rose the pealing quire:— Tombs of dead ages, thus thine Abbeys stand Whose very ruins consecrate a land! Sister of Scotland! lift thy grief-worn face, In Christ victorious be; Not gloom alone, but glory tracks the trace Stern archives bear of thee: Bid temples rise, and shrines of prayer abound Where ancient Faith with martyr-wreaths was crown'd. Saint Andrew's Day. “Jesus ? saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and he saith ? Follow me.” —Gospel for the Day. The world knows least its greatest men, Their records are on high, But where they liv'd, or, how and when They laid them down to die, Rests oft conceal'd from that recording fame Blind earth-gods call the glory of a name. And in this dwells a wisdom deep To solemnise our thought,— A truth which bids Ambition weep If we have basely wrought: For, crowns and conquests God's elect despise, Whose angel-worth seems copied from the skies. Thus holds it with that Saint who came To Jesu's village-home, The first that bore disciple's name And bade his brother come Like him, to gaze upon the Lamb of God And follow where His guiding footsteps trod; Since o'er that night a veil is thrown, Screening in silence there All which Tradition would have known Of penitence and prayer,— Of calm enquiry, or celestial word That thrill'd St. Andrew, by devotion stirr'd. Yes, he who was the primal guest Beneath Messiah's roof, By whom enquiring Greeks were blest (While others shrank aloof) In seeing Jesus on that festal day When pilgrims sought old Salem's walls to pray,— Is fameless in the roll of men! Nor on God's mystic page Mark we his shadow rise again For musing saint or sage, Except to bring a lone and shrinking “lad” Blent with the crowd, who loaves and fishes had, Before his Lord,—that Christ might feed By miracle the host. Thus learn we what the wisest need And angels value most,— How oft the nearest unto heaven are those Of whom the loud-voic'd world but little knows! Poor victims they of time and sense, Whose glories must arise From what mere lips of clay dispense Or lauding sinners prize!— How can the wisdom which is born of earth Weigh the true measures of immortal worth? Oh rather, like St. Andrew, be By secret virtue great; Resign'd, if God reserve for thee That first Disciple's fate,— In exiled loneliness to preach and die And mount to glory on the martyr's sigh. Lord of our souls! by this we find 'Tis not through outward fame The moral saviours of mankind Eternalise their name; Since oft in secrecy of love retir'd, For heaven they toil, by heaven alone inspired. Far from the rush of public strife In hearts and homes serene, The hidden and the heavenly life Of Saints hath ever been That salient impulse, on whose virtue wait The master-elements of Church and State. Nor may we mourn because our God Thus for high worth decreed, That Minds who most this way have trod And lessen'd mortal need Should often vanish into fameless gloom,— Unheard their country, and unknown their tomb. But rather let disciples learn To conquer self and sin; And thus a higher law discern By which our souls begin To work like Angels, who in secret move On countless errands of celestial Love. True glory is what God decrees, By faith's obedience done; While they, who earth-blind man would please, Forget that awful One Who wrapt his Godhead in a robe of clay And died in Luke xxiii. 44. darkness from the earth away! Saint Thomas the Apostle. “Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy hand ? and be not faithless, but believing.” —Gospel for the Day. For praise, for charity, and christian rest Pure festivals of holy Church abide; And times have been, when saints who loved them best Found there some deepest yearning gratified. Like garlands they festoon'd the blood-red past When hero-spirits dared for Jesu die; And martyrs, now with human seraphs class'd, Look'd into heaven with Stephen's lifted eye. Thus from the court and city, camp and field Hymning Devotion with glad myriads came High Lauds for some heroic Saint to yield, And sun their hearts in His resplendent name. A death in Jesus was a birth-day, then, Till martyr-tombs like Altars came to be Where the dead ashes of undying men Seem all instinct with immortality! Nor let St. Thomas be the last or least Of laurell'd Memories to churchmen dear, When call'd to celebrate each time-hoar'd feast Ranged in the cycle of our christian year. Of doubting heart but not of double mind, His love intenser, than his light was keen,— Christ hath ordain'd him to instruct mankind By warning type of what the best have been. Sway'd by blind sense, his inward eye became Clouded and closed against that World divine, Which dawns on conscience, but whose deepest claim Is oft resisted, if the will incline. And yet, the Apostolic choir he graced By zeal impassion'd, whose heroic glow Death rather than desertion nobly faced, Nor fled from danger John xi. 16. in the night of woe. By gentleness the Saviour made him great, Rebuk'd the sceptic, but the saint restored; And, how we glory, when high words narrate His heart seem'd bursting with,—“My God and Lord!” When Thou, Emanuel, didst Thy wounds unveil And stand before him, palpably confest:— So may we learn forbearance with the frail Whose minds are rocking with profound unrest. All doubt is human, but true faith divine; And such, at length, that martyr'd saint inspir'd Whose life, oh, Lord! became for Thee and Thine A ceaseless pilgrimage of love untir'd. O'er desert, sea, and many a torrid waste, Though Parthian wild and India's idol-shore Wing'd by devotion,—see St. Thomas haste And die the death his Master did before. Love was his light; and thus, dear Lord, may we Gain by pure hearts that evidence sublime, Which makes the Secret of eternity Absorb the senses, and subdue our time. For, holy love is like a gracious death In which the Adam of the flesh departs, Till the new creature, with aspiring breath, Pants for the Home of all regen'rate hearts. The Conversion of St. Paul. “God ? through the preaching of St. Paul, caused the light of the Gospel to shine throughout the world ? we having his wonderful conversion in remembrance.” —Collect for the Day. Martyr for Christ and miracle to man,— If ere conversion by its glory can Irradiate the clouds which roll In lurid darkness round the soul, It is, when saints with raptured glow recall That lion of the Church,—the lofty-minded Paul! Culture Acts ix. 1. and cruelty in him combined At once to fascinate and awe mankind; And thus, made fierce by flaming zeal,— Nature and Grace can thence reveal A teaching contrast, where the Church can read Much that excited souls in some dark moment need. Here is a Witness, with whose truthful light The gospel puts the infidel to flight!— Struck by a miracle, the maddest foe Who ever dealt a murd'rer's blow On christian virtue, suddenly outcries “What must I do, O Lord!” and lifts his scalèd eyes. Robed in a Vesture of incarnate beams Dark'ning bright noon with supernat'ral gleams, The persecuted Lord appears And pours on his appallèd ears, Like muffled thunder heard on midnight-sea, Tones which in Hebrew said “Why persecut'st thou Me?” And never did God's miracle of grace With more divinity reveal its trace Than in the contrast, thus beheld!— When bigotry, by mercy quelled, Sank into softness, while the blinded Paul Thrill'd the admiring Heavens ix. 11. with adoration's call. Three years, an eremite of weeping prayer Hid in Arabia's wild,—the Spirit, there, By Voice, and Vision, and by ways Screen'd from the search of mortal gaze, Instructs the convert with celestial lore And lifts him up to heights, Saint never scaled before! But when, at length, to Salem's home return'd, How keenly in him must his heart have burn'd As on the blood-tinged gates, vii. 58. perchance He fixed his aw'd and mournful glance, Where, three years since, the martyr'd Stephen cried “Forgive them, gracious Lord,”—and into glory died! Or when the flashing dome of that dread Shrine Whose very air once breath'd, to him, divine, Rose dawning on the distant sky Before the Convert's tearful eye,— How thrill'd he now to learn his God had been The Antitype in flesh of all that Temple-scene! And, what to him, are time, and scene, and earth, The vaunting nothingness of blood and birth; Phil. iii. 5, 8. The pomp, the princedom, or the smiles By which a Belial-world beguiles The victims who on sensual good rely And find no blissful heaven, but that beneath the sky? “To live is Christ,”—behold, a master-spell Whose power eternity alone may tell! These were the words, by which array'd, That hero of the Cross obey'd The charm they wielded, till his dying breath— The glory of his life and grandeur of his death! Man's inner-world his diocese became Through which he heralded Messiah's name; Nor earth, nor hell, nor sword, nor fire His superhuman zeal could tire,— Unhasting and unresting like a star Whose moving lustre fills deep midnight from afar. And in the Lord, his children are not we, The island-Church, catholical, and free?— As Gentiles, on this festal day Lord of the conscience! unto Thee we pray That each true doctrine Thine Apostle taught May sanctify the soul, a dread Atonement bought. “Who art Thou, Lord!”—Alas, if thus Acts vii. 56. men cry, Dungeon'd in doubt, beneath God's open'd sky. The Saviour in his people lives; Gal. ii. 20. And he who unto anguish gives A cup of water, with a christian heart, Of Christ's own Body Ephes. v. 30. is a sacramental part. Purification of Saint Mary the Virgin. “Thy only-begotten Son was this day presented in the Temple.” —Collect for the Day. Around us, though we trace them not, Beat lone and loving hearts, Who sanctify some quiet spot By all which grace imparts; Far from the rude-voiced world retir'd, In secresy they dwell, By faith, and not by flesh, inspir'd,— Fond Psalm xci. 3. Angels know them well. Prophetic heart and prescient eye To such by God are giv'n, Who scan His footsteps in the sky And token-signs from heaven,— Which men who love the whirl of life, Self-blinded cannot see; Lost in that harsh and hurried strife Which hides eternity. To watch and wait, to weep and pray, Nor fear to face alone That noiseless and unnoticed way To none but Christians, known, For them is privilege and peace, A paradise within, Who sigh on earth for heaven's release,— An Exodus from sin! So lived the saints of hoary time, The Lord's elect, indeed, Impassion'd by a hope sublime To view almighty Seed!— Divine Consoler of the race In human nature born, In Whom Jehovah's unveil'd face Brightens this world forlorn. 2 Cor. iv. 5. Thus, Simeon down to ripe old age Kept a devoted soul; And Anna, with a deep presage Oft through the temple stole; For Priest and Prophetess conceal'd One passionate desire,— In Flesh to hail his God reveal'd, And then, from earth retire. He comes at last, how secretly! Gentle as gliding dove, Nor earth, nor heaven exclaims, “'tis He, The Lord of worlds above.” Nature her wonted calm retains, Nor voice nor vision tells The everlasting God who reigns,— In yon frail Infant dwells! But Simeon in his priestly arms Cradl'd the awful Child; And while he saw those living charms Which on him look'd and smil'd, Oh, Woman! high o'er women blest Pure mother of our Lord, Was ever babe like Thine caress'd, Who was th' Incarnate Word? What thrills of throbbing wonder ran Through agèd Simeon's heart As weeping rapture thus began, “Lord, let me hence depart, For now my trancèd eyes have seen Salvation's light at last,— On Whom since time and woe have been Thy people's hopes were cast!” And, hath the scene for us no spell, No sign, or symbol, there, Whose meanings to Devotion tell The vision-power of prayer?— Far otherwise our Church proclaims, Who, with th' Eternal Child, St. Mary and her vestal claims Reveres as undefiled. And where, but in Thy Temple, God, Didst Thou in flesh appear, Whose courts had been for ages trod By Levite, Saint, and Seer? So is it now, if souls desire Visions of Christ to view,— They love to feed the altar-fire With incense ever new. The temple is their home of truth, The house of peace and prayer Hallow'd alike by age and youth, Who seek Jehovah there By laud, or litany, or hymn;— And, touch'd by awe divine, Commingle with the Seraphim Who crowd that mercy-shrine. St. Matthias' Day. “Almighty God, who into the place of the traitor Judas didst choose thy faithful servant Matthias.” —Collect for the Day. Lov'd, and yet lost! oh, God of worlds and souls, A mental Antichrist mere Reason grows When o'er such mystery her eye-glance rolls,— To scan profoundly what Thy wisdom knows. Round man a limiting horizon lies Against whose everlasting bounds and bars Mind turns to madness, when it vainly tries To burst them through and soar beyond the stars! Be this the creed all heaven-taught spirits own,— That sin is human, holiness divine, And they who perish, from their wills alone That way derive to which bad hearts incline. Decrees which petrify the fount of grace Our Church repudiates with holy dread, And greets redemption for the human race In that great Victim who on Calv'ry bled. The un-creation of apostate will,— Sin must be measur'd by the guilt of man, Whose free elections in the flesh fulfill No other purpose but corruption's plan. On the fair brightness of this festal day Clouds of deep awe a shading dimness throw, But in pure faith we let them pass away,— John xiii. 7.“What now I do, hereafter ye shall know!” Such were the soothing tones, St. Peter heard Who inly question'd what Emanuel did, Till the deep wisdom of th' Incarnate Word The asking boldness of his heart forbid. Yet, lesson'd are we by the fearful thought That he who wore an apostolic crown Above all monarchs' with true glory fraught,— In treason lived, till murder laid it down! Warn'd and re-warn'd by many a prescient tone And word significant, for conscience meant, Seems it as though Iscariot might have known The coming shadow of that dread event. But blinding avarice the soul beset, Satan and self their covenant had made, And not till ruin'd, felt the wild regret For blasted vows and innocence betray'd. Priests of the Lord,—let Judas warn them well Lest in some heart a secret germ may hide Of that which hurl'd him to the lowest hell, At once a traitor and a suicide! If lucre-dreams not love for souls inspire The impious mocker, who presumes to say “Come, Holy Ghost; and with celestial fire Purge the vile dross of sin and self away,” Alas, for him! but grace and truth are Thine, And through the channels of Thy church can flow; The hands are human, but the gifts divine Which all their virtue to Thy merit owe,— Who art of sacraments the vital Spring, Their viewless Source of purity and power When souls their sacrifice of worship bring And throng thy Temple, in devotion's hour. Nor should false worldlings in their pride forget, If lust of income o'er the conscience reign Some heart of Judas may be throbbing yet And act, in principle, his crime again! And, Lord of souls, let faithful shepherds feed The Flock committed unto past'ral care; Not lured by gain, but finding all their meed When Glory's fold shall see true converts there. The Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. “The Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” —Epistle for the Day. Begun by Gabriel, hark! how echoing time Thrill'd by the magic of Almighty love, Deepens the cadence of that “hail! sublime “Mother of Him Whom heaven enshrines above.”— Weak in thyself, but high o'er women blest When God was cradl'd on thy heart at rest. What bright emotions trembl'd o'er his wings When quiv'ring downward with celestial play They waft a plum'd ambassador, who brings Hosea ii. 19. The great announcement of Earth's bridal Day, While more commenc'd, than man could seek by sign Isaiah ix. 11. From depths eternal, or from heights divine. Four thousand years of prophecy enclose Their vast fulfilment in the Virgin's womb, When He, who ransom'd Nature from her woes And from hereafter roll'd away its gloom,— The living substance of his mother took As He was member'd in Jehovah's book. Psalm cxxxix. 16. Bone of our bone and flesh of ours become, A perfect Man with perfect God combin'd,— Here can the Church perceive her central Home And source of all which sanctifies mankind; While God's elect in born Emanuel see The lineage of the Lord by faith, are we. Yet coldly her magnificat we chant, Whose heart was bathed with superhuman bliss When to her God, with rapture jubilant, The Virgin mounted in a strain like this— “The Lord hath magnified my low estate And deathless time shall call his Handmaid great.” Well may we crown this Miracle of days, When God and Man, Eternity and Time Blend in dread unity of love and praise, Till language trembles o'er such theme sublime:— Like baffled eagles ere they reach the sky, Our words sink downward when they soar too high. The woes of Woman as pronounced on Eve, Reversed in Mary, now pure blessings prove Since He who said “A virgin shall conceive, For ever consecrates connubial love And breathes o'er Wedlock sacramental charms Ephes. v. 31, 32. Which serve to shield it from defiling harms. Not from mere dust, as primal Adam came, Messiah's Flesh was organised for man; Nor from the angels sprang that sinless Frame In which God realised Redemption's plan; But, “made of woman,” by the Holy Ghost,— Here is the mercy which redeems the lost! The sainted Mother of incarnate God! Well may transcendency to her belong And Fancy dream that in such heart abode Luke ii. 19. Secrets, which found no syllable or song To echo what that vestal Mother knew Under whose smile th' Eternal Infant grew! Saint Mark's Day. “Almighty God, who hast instructed thy holy church with the heavenly doctrine of thy Evangelist St. Mark.” —Collect for the Day. If dying words can never die, How deathless that departing one Which, ere he closed his placid eye, Was murmur'd by the Almighty Son Matt. xxvii. 51. When “finished” gave the earth-convulsing sign Sin was atoned by sacrifice Divine. What lack they, then, who call the Lord Their own, by likeness and by love?— The treasures of His will and Word Descend upon them from above; While church and creed by covenant are theirs, With feasts and festivals and heaven-breath'd prayers. Inheritors by faith are we Of more than golden worlds could give, If through Incarnate Deity A spirit-life we yearn to live, And daily by devotion's law are taught The finished work atoning God-man wrought. What lack we?—grace and gifts are ours, Sermons, and Sacraments and rites, While guardian-hosts of wingèd Powers Heb. i. 14. Circle our pathway day and night.— Alas, one thing we need!—inward power and will In danger and in darkness to fulfill Implicitly the Lord's command!— Through blasts of doctrine vain as vile What reeds we are! who cannot stand When Persecution storms awhile; But shake and tremble in the tempest-gloom And sigh in secret for a pangless tomb. May he, who was St. Peter's friend And echo of his chasten'd heart, Some holy warning this day send, Whose wisdom may its worth impart To all who, in the calm of culture, seem Of life enamoured as a lulling dream. But if, Mark-like, our courage faint When death and danger bring their cross, And in the sinner merge the saint Because we did not count the loss,— May his revival prophesy our own And so prepare us for the Judgment-throne! Though recreant once, Acts xv. 38. his palsied soul Shrank from a conflict fierce and far, Rallied by Peter's blest control,— He lived to wage the christian war; Founded a Church, and when the summons came, Corded and crush'd he bore Emanuel's shame. And should we, through betrayful sin, Feel discord in some loveless hour Profane the soul with impious din That echoes back the Tempter's power,— Let harsh Acts xv. 38. contention, by Apostles, find That Christ alone can harmonise the mind. Friendship and love, as born of earth, Wither and waste when left alone; 'Tis heaven that grants the crowning worth Whence true affections take their tone;— What men call union, is a moral cheat Unless cemented at the Mercy-seat. And, are not saints profoundly taught By shrinking Mark on this high day A lesson with this warning fraught,— That evermore men watch and pray Lest, in some dreaming trance of sense and time, For bliss on earth they barter hope sublime. Come, blended trial, woe and tears! Arise, and shake the earth, O Lord; Winnow the chaff Luke iii. 17. till wheat appears Created by Thy living word:— Far better thus to tremble, ere we die, Than perish when Thy throne o'ershades the sky! St. Philip and St. James's Day. “Following the footsteps of thy holy Apostles St. Philip and St. James.” Collect for the Day. Church of the living God! thou hast not lost (As human temple for the Holy Ghost) Thine awful privilege on earth to be The sacramental home of Deity Compare 1 Cor. iii. 16, with 2 Cor. vi. 16. Where in the tones of His omniscient Word The echoes of Emanuel's heart are heard, And mortal language serves but to conceal That mystic Presence rapt adorers feel. Still by those Creeds in which Apostles thought Consenting harmonies of truth are sought; While Paul and Peter, James and loved St. John Cast their bright crowns before th' Incarnate One. And privileg'd beyond compare are those Who on those doctrines of their Lord repose Celestial authors in the Scripture teach,— Who loved to practise what they lived to preach. Pure christianity is God in man 1 Col. i. 27. Which Christ Himself in human souls began; Whose germs, unfolded by maturing time, At length expand in character sublime. Thou inward Teacher of the Truth, and Way! Deep is the lore Thy scholars learn to-day If with receptive hearts our Cross we take And meekly bear it, for the Master's sake. Since, what are heroes in the church enshrin'd, But types and tokens of that saintly Mind,— Of calm submission or composèd will, The world should witness in our conduct, still. Oh, for a spirit, like to that which cried (What Angel can?) “my Love was crucified!” And felt, beneath affliction's blasting rod, That grief was glory when endured for God. So is it now, if, Lord of yielded souls, The viewless sceptre of Thy grace controls Each pulse regen'rate, which in praise or prayer Throbs with that life Thy Spirit wakens, there. Nerv'd with new force, may apostolic flames Burn in each breast, like those which fired St. James; And back to earth those peerless times recall When Life seem'd nothing, save the Lord was all. Saint Barnabas the Apostle. “They sent forth Barnabas ? He was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost.” —Epistle for the Day. And didst thou choose the better part Accepted Mary, Luke x. 42. meek and mild, When seated near the Saviour's heart And learning like a little child?— Such attitude the loving soul Must ever take in things divine If faith would hear that whisper roll, “Lo, I am His, and He is mine:” Since Christ is Wisdom, and His counsel, truth,— Guardian of age and guide of perill'd youth. But, next to Him, the Church would hail Those mirrors which reflect the Lord,— Apostles, in whose type prevail All which their grace and gifts afford Of prowess, purity, and zeal, And heaven-toned virtue, calm and high, Whose radiant altitudes reveal How near they rose, to reach the sky!— Not as Apostles, but, as sainted men Why may we not behold their like again? And, what a teaching mass we find Of character before us set, Whose truths and tempers yield mankind Wisdom,—the wise are learning yet! Highway and hedge, the lane, the street, Judèan wilds, the temple-court, Or busy mart where rivals meet And thronging hosts for gain resort,— Each may afford to Faith's perusing eyes Warnings the lesson'd heart will love to prize. But on this day the Church may see A mortal Barnabas, i.e. “The son of consolation.” paraclete in love, Whose breast o'erflow'd with deity “Full of the Holy Ghost,” Acts xi. 24. Illapsing from Himself above:— By sympathetic depth of heart His nature and his name express Oh Truth! how magical thou art When mighty by pure gentleness, Like him who laid his lands by purchase down In sign of homage to the Saviour's crown. Love was his charm; but never yet Perfection, save in Christ, appears; And this mild Levite wakes regret When we recall his recreant fears:— By weak compliance once he fell And compromised his Master's cause By shielding Acts xv. 37, 38. (though He knew him well) The Saint who broke those sacred laws Which bind us, when our Creeds for succour call, In Christ to see our everlasting All. Let not our hearts like Eli love, Who in the parent sank his God, And rather than a Vice reprove Endur'd the way bad children trod. Blandness becomes a treason-crime And soft affections serpents are,— Except beyond the bounds of time By faith we live; and learn by prayer To guard the conscience from seductive wiles When meek-tongued compromise the man beguiles. Such lesson, Lord, a land requires, By prayer and principle unbraced; Where faintly burn our altar-fires And weak confessors stand disgraced, While pagan culture, polish'd mien And languor with its loveless eye Forget what martyr'd souls have been When friends and foes were scowling nigh:— Heroes we want, whose never-shaking nerve A universe might fail from God to swerve! Serene, contemplative and pure Like John of Patmos may we prove, Whom death nor dungeon could allure To break the spell of holy love. Eternity through time he saw, And God in man by grace beheld; And therefore, with rebuking awe The traitor and his treason quell'd, Causing the world this creed of Heaven to know,— The Friend of sinners was of sin the Foe. St. John Baptist's Day. “The voice of Him that crieth in the Wilderness,—Prepare ye the way of the Lord.” Epistle for the Day. Precursor of that peerless One Gift of all gifts, God's only Son,— We celebrate his wondrous Luke i. 44. birth to-day; Where mystery and miracle combine To arm with purity almost divine Truth's martyr, who for Christ prepared the way. Herald and harbinger of grace, He terminates a mighty race Of Patriarchs, Prophets, Priests, and Kings of yore, Whose mingled types and tokens now depart Since Thou of shadows perfect Substance Col. ii. 17. art,— God in our Flesh, Whom prostrate Worlds adore! No wilful passion, strange or wild, Faith's holy anchorite beguiled Like stern Elijah,—girt with camel-hair In rocky solitudes to hide and dwell Far from the sway of home's domestic spell, And build his being up to Virtue there. But, guided by the God within, He battled with the world of sin Lifting the banner of the Cross on high; And utter'd forth with fearlessness sublime Words which are trumpets in the ears of Time,— “Creation! listen, for the Lord is nigh!” In John behold the hero-part! No compromise could bend his heart: When vice and villany rebuke deserved He with undaunted brow and daring breath Bore his true witness in the face of Death,— By God inspir'd, and for His glory nerved. And are not pulpits preaching-thrones Where heaven-voiced Truth her function owns,— To censure all which Church and Creed condemn? Alas, for Discipline, if palsied mind Become emasculate and o'er-refined, And vice in torrents will not dare to stem! Bold in rebuke Saints cannot be Till Error in their lives can see Patterns, which give to precept all its grace;— For words are weakness when they stand alone, Without example to inspire their tone With grander meaning than our guilt can face. A Belial-heart from John may learn Athletic virtues keen and stern, And sainted hopes, serenely form'd for heaven:— Lone as Elijah, far from home and pride The flesh he tamed, self-will was crucified And the whole man to prayer and pureness given. Un-worldlike in the world to prove,— Hard problem this, for highest love! And, unresolved,—except by vestal souls Who like incarnate angels can retain Baptismal purity without a stain, Keeping the covenant no flesh controls. Not in the harsh and heedless crowd Heaven's lulling tones can be allow'd With inward melody the heart to fill; There, fever'd passion with exciting sway Frets the worn mind, and frights that Dove away Whose wings are brooding o'er the Altar, still. Far from the strife of tongues, oh Lord! Attract us by Thy teaching Word To haunts of holiness and heavenly calm; Where, Heb. x. 22. sprinkled with the Blood of blest release, Conscience is lull'd to everlasting peace And bathes our being in celestial balm. Hail, solitude! true nurse of Saints, The soul that in thy shadow faints Can never like a second Baptist be— A hero-spirit, unto whom was given On earth to lead the angel-life of heaven And starlike Dan. xii. 30. shrine through all eternity. Saint Peter's Day. “Almighty God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to thy Apostle Saint Peter many excellent gifts.” —Collect for the Day. He wept!—as they alone can weep When love inspires the tears which fall Till visions o'er remembrance sweep And thoughts the past recall, While some pierced heart we stab by treason now,— Bleeds into anguish o'er the broken vow. Feeling outsoar'd his faith within, Beyond himself he seem'd to rise, And little dreamt how fett'ring sin Chains mortal Will below the skies: A true Apostle but an erring man Seems the great Soul in whom the Church began Upon that mystic “Rock” to rest, (The Incarnation's creed sublime!) Such was St. Peter ever-blest, Whose words, out-lasting earth and time, Are types and tokens of all truths profound Which in the heart of Sacraments abound. In him contrasted and combined Weakness and worth were strangely met: A Hero both in heart and mind, All rapture now—and then, regret; Of danger dreadless; yet, betray'd by fear, The Lion trembled, though his Lord was near! Impassion'd, fervid, flame-eyed zeal He bodied forth in word and deed; And felt, as holy warriors feel, For Christ prepar'd to burn or bleed:— But stern and strong, his temper wildly rose Like the rude gale which o'er Geness'ret blows. Yet He Who read with piercing eyes Each fibre of the inner-man, Though Peter still to priesthood cries— “My grace apart, John xv. 5. ye nothing can For heaven or holiness on earth achieve, But more and more God's wounded Spirit grieve.” Lord, grant, that while each grace and gift The prince of Thine Apostles shared The Church's living faith may lift To where Thou art in heaven declared,— Impetuous dreams we calm and chasten down And learn the Cross before we love the Crown. “Though all forsake Thee, yet not I!” So felt bold Simon's fiery heart; But, ah, how soon Emanuel's eye Look'd Luke xxii. 61. more than language could impart, When crew the cock, and in yon crowded hall Some weeping Angel saw St. Peter fall! Oh, by that look of deathless love Where God and Man divinely blend, Incarnate! from Thy Throne above Still to the Church a token send, That should we faint beneath apostate fears Thy glance may thrill us into soul-drawn tears. Matt. xxvi. 25. And if Thy dooming will decree Some daily cross from friend or foe,— Heroical let each soul be And vanquish, by enduring, woe; Or, smile as calmly o'er severest pains As slept thy martyr Acts xii. 6. in his midnight-chains. Forgiven thrice, who thrice denied His Lord!—and art Thou not the same, As when St. Peter at Thy side Blush'd into pangs of holy shame To hear the question, “Lov'st thou Me and mine?— Then, feed my Sheep in pasturage divine.” Descend, O Paraclete of grace! Anointer of each priested soul, And with almighty Blood efface Indwelling sin's abhorr'd control; Till sheep and shepherds, by the pastures green, Form the One Fold where Thy true flocks are seen. Saint James the Apostle. “Saint James, leaving his father and all that he had, without delay, was obedient unto the calling of Jesus Christ.” —Collect for the Day. “Ye know not what ye ask, who seek On My right Hand to sit and reign; The will is frail, and courage weak In mast'ring superhuman pain: Deep is the Cup! and anguish dread 'Tis Mine to drink, before I die, Nor know ye what your lips have said Who thus for royal glories sigh.” With accent of foreboding love And gentleness all-gravely-wise, Thus did the prescient Saviour prove The perill'd hearts ambition tries.— By zeal impassion'd, yet betray'd Through blind emotions, born of earth, They stumble most, when least afraid How sin can mar the second birth. Drink of His “Cup,” indeed, they shall And His Matt. xx. 23. baptismal pangs endure, Who crucify their selfish all And find the Cross their only cure For constant wounds of sin and strife The world inflicts,—when faith would soar And overcome this earth-chain'd life, “With Christ” to be for evermore. St. James was in the path of toil When “Follow Me!” Emanuel said; And lo, at once, the rude turmoil He left, to haste where Jesu led. What, though an aged sire remain'd Bereft of son and sympathy, The homage of his heart was gain'd— For He who spoke, was Deity! So is it now: our daily path Is flower'd with blessings rich and rare When duty in devotion hath Obey'd the voice of Conscience, there:— Faith should not yearn for great event Or crisis through some wondrous change, But with the calm of home content In peace pursue life's wonted range. Or if, like James, our hearts aspire In some rapt dream too high for man And grow inflam'd with zealot-fire, Oh teach us, Lord, the milder plan!— The “Son of Thunder” soften Thou And with the balm of love allay; Till the stern Luke ix. 54. bigot from the brow In soft forbearance dies away. And if we from this vale of tears By heart-ascension inly rise To that high Realm, where Christ appears Enthroned amid adoring skies, Behold our creed!—His Cup and Cross To drink and suffer, is the doom Of all who seek to gain by loss Matt. x. 39. And triumph o'er the dreaded tomb. In heaven there is a crown prepared Matt. xx. 23. A throne of deepest radiance set, But Truth Incarnate hath declared Unknown on earth are they as yet,— The seal'd Inheritors who shall That kingly eminence enjoy: Yet faith believes for each and all Are glories which can never cloy. Saint Bartholomew the Apostle. “O Almighty and everlasting God, who didst give to thine Apostle Bartholomew grace, truly to believe and preach thy Word.” —Collect for the Day. Election flows from secret grace But character from will proceeds;— The first, to God alone we trace, The second human effort needs: Thus in the saving work of souls combine Both God and Man, by mystery divine. Source of the guileless heart! by Whom Nathaniels in the spirit live, Let sun-bright innocence illume The life Thy daily mercies give, That like that single Mind which came John i. 47. and saw,— Simplicity may prove our perfect law. A power exists in purity, A hidden strength in holiness, A light by which saints learn to see Secrets beyond what Angels bless,— An inward-eye by sanctity unscaled To welcome visions Luke x. 24. Prophets never hail'd. In solitude of prayer retired Beneath a fig-tree's twilight-shade, Such was the soul by faith inspired And by no sordid guile betray'd Whom Jesus call'd the Apostolic dove,— A perfect Israelite whose creed was Love. Oh that like him, our hearts may learn Dark pride and prejudice to shun, And by celestial beams discern Those heaven-ward paths the Lord begun,— So we may reach the everlasting Goal And keep unstain'd the whiteness of our soul. Some “Nazareth” John i. 46. offends them all Whom clouds of carnal self deceive; And scales of blinding sense must fall, 'Ere harsh and hasty minds believe How much of wisdom, and true worth may grow In quiet nooks the world disdains to know. In loneliness of musing love, Nathaniel by the Book of heaven Was train'd to welcome from above Glad tidings of a Saviour given, When cried St. Philip with adoring awe— “The Lamb behold, Who antetypes the Law!” Thus be it with ourselves, O, Lord! Let shades of calm seclusion fold Their shelter round us, while The Word In peace and prayer shall be unroll'd; Nor let us, fever'd by ambition-fires, Seek the vile world which vanity inspires. God's heroes are in secret form'd, And homes retired are Virtue's school; While passions, which have wildly storm'd In selfish riot, man to rule,— Have left their victims unappeased at last With nought remember'd, but a ruin'd past! Eye of The Everlasting One! Bent on Nathaniel while he pray'd, Be Thou our perfect shield and sun, Alike in public, or in shade; Abroad, at home, let pure religion be,— A heart made guileless, and in Heaven, with Thee. Matt. vi. 20 St. Matthew the Apostle. “Jesus ? saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith unto him, follow me.” —Gospel for the Day. Lost in the gloom of life's tempestuous sea How anchorless the shipwreck'd heart must be, Unless by faith 'tis fasten'd on The Lord Who walks the waves, and rules them by His word. Here is that creed, which glorifies their lot— Saints cannot live where christian love breathes not! And Christ, by omnipresent grace, is found Where Duty leads, and makes it hallow'd ground. Those peopled solitudes, loud cities vast, If there by heaven thy cross of life be cast, O thought divine! the aching soul to bless,— The Lord is with thee, in thy loneliness. Yet little dream they, who in village-calm Drink the free gales of freshness or of balm, Or the blue magic of o'erarching skies Delight to mirror on their grateful eyes,— How oft some town-worn victims inly long To hear the woodland chant a breezy song; Or wind and wander through embowering glade Where the green twilight sheds a cooling shade. But, Christ knows best, what cross his saints require Who like Himself to be, on earth aspire, And guards their doom, and guides their devious ways, And watches o'er them with unwearied gaze. The hush of Nature seems a holy thing,— But, deathless Man a deeper lore may bring; Nor can mute landscapes be with meaning fraught Like the stern wisdom crowded streets have brought: And myriads in the dust and din of strife Rest on the vision of that inner-life Th' elect of God (unknown to sense) enjoy, And live serene amid the world's alloy. But he who, summon'd from the haunted Lake, Matt. ix. 9. Rose at the word, and for Emanuel's sake Shook from his soul with spiritual disdain What wordlings call a glory and their gain,— Teaches to-day, what sacrifice can do, When to The Lord our pulse of love beats true; While in that publican, let Pity learn That none are outcasts, when to God they turn. Oh! for a heart, which, like St. Matthew, leaves That mammon-world whose vice the Spirit grieves;— Flies from the golden martyrdom of wealth And finds in poverty true peace and health. When base expediency, like Naaman, bends In Rimmon's temple for apostate ends, Earth calls it, providence!—but with God 'tis crime, Which makes eternity succumb to time. Christ is the Income of celestial hearts When the vain world with its vile gold departs; And man's true riches in The Spirit are,— Comfort and calm, with purity and prayer. Yet need we not from throng'd abodes to fly; If Duty calls—then God himself is nigh! Nor pine in fancy for monastic cell, But take our cross, and try to bear it well. Heaven shines on earth, when souls by faith can see The lustres of reveal'd eternity Reposing softly on that secret path, Whose winding still the Saviour's footprint hath. St. Michael and all Angels. “O Everlasting God, who hast ordained and constituted the services of Angels ? in a wonderful order.” —Collect for the Day. Thy temple, Nature, none can duly tread, Except by more than mortal guidance led In all thy forms and facts to see The sightless Hand of Deity Shaping all objects by some plastic spell, The lights of science are too dark to tell. But “laws” become blind substitutes for God Who rules creation by a viewless rod; While second causes oft exclude Jehovah from our solitude,— Though morning, noon, and night, the sea and air Cause of all causes—God Himself declare! In days of darkness worshipp'd Angels drew A false allegiance from a faith untrue; And sacrilegious dreams began To mar Redemption's holy plan, Which gives to God supremacy alone And bows the universe before His Throne! But science hath reversed such error now, Dethron'd the Angels, and will scarce allow That aught beyond some mindless force Empowers creation's wond'rous course! And scoffs to hear, wing'd Messengers of love Can waft a blessing from their bowers above. Yet hearts, whose wisdom is God's holy Word With child-like awe and chaste devotion heard, That camping Angels round them stand In viewless hosts, on either hand,— Believe; and in such ministry delight Whether it guide the day or guard the night. And thus do Nature Providence and Grace, (Whose threefold regions hold our human race) Instinct with angels more and more Become to spirits, who can soar High o'er that limit blinded Sense would throw Round all who seek the seraph-world to know. Serene and pure, ye bodiless and bright! Above mere science and material sight, Princes and Peers! whose home is heaven And unto whom by God are given Splendour and strength, with sympathy for all Who Christ both Head of men and angels call,— In nature's world where'er we muse or stray, Or through dim providence explore the way, To us unerring truth declares Heb. i. 14. Ye minister, as glory's heirs; Or, gather round us with a guardian-wing And viewless aid to perill'd moments bring. When in some aisle, for awful worship meet Baptised adorers round one Mercy-seat, Angels with us communion hold Though none their beaming plumes unfold; And round the Altar love to realise The truth of faith's unbleeding sacrifice. Divine Inspirer of adoring thought! Be this high theme with heaven-born rev'rence fraught And grant us that religious eye Which shadows forth in earth and sky Myriads of angels—moving to and fro And working miracles, we little know! And when at length the silver cord is broken And our last life-pulse gives its ebbing token, O Thou! Who in Thine agony Some Angel hadst to strengthen Thee,— Luke xxii. 43. Let such wing'd herald in that hour attend And waft our spirit where Thy saints ascend. St. Luke the Evangelist. “Only Luke is with me.” —Epistle for the Day. A holy concord of embracing hearts Beneath the Cross of Jesus blended, To friendship an undying spell imparts That lives when time and toil are ended:— Union like this survives the earth's decay And deepens when the world dissolves away! Such was the amity serene and strong, By Luke and Paul in union shared; Heart link'd with heart, each persecuting wrong Which tyranny and torture dared On God's elect ones to inflict or bring,— They master'd well by meekest suffering. High in the calendar of sainted Worth Luke the beloved most justly stands,— Comrade of Him whose spirit walks the earth And leavens all converted Lands With faith and feeling,—pure as Paul inspires When hearts are kindled with congenial fires. Danger, nor death, the dungeon, sword, nor stake Their sacred bond of friendship broke; Each cheer'd the other, for the Church's sake And triumph'd in their Master's yoke;— His Cup to drink, His destined Cross to bear, Was all their glory and the goal of prayer. But he, 2 Tim. iv. 10. whose earth-chain'd spirit could not soar, A contrast and a recreant proved; Whose heart was canker'd at its secret core And hollow, as the World he loved: Fickle and faint, such cold apostate grew To man unfeeling, and to God, untrue. By peril daunted, cow'ring Demas left The dungeon'd Paul alone—to die! Save for St. Luke, of each true soul bereft And bound in dark captivity: Alas! for him, who dared not face the doom Of preaching Christ in cave or catacomb: He barter'd heaven for pottage Gen. xxv. 31, 32. mean and base; But, had he no remorseful hour? Blush'd not his conscience o'er such black disgrace, And writhed he not beneath its power, As oft the features of forsaken Paul Tortured remembrance would at times recall? Craven he was;—and so, perchance, are we Who in the calm of cloudless life Pillars of truth so oft appear to be,— But tremble in the storm and strife! And were we summon'd to the martyr-cell Would not the type of Demas warn us well? Our blinded hearts are hypocrites, O Lord! And little can the wisest know (Unless illumined by Thy radiant word) What serpent-guile sleeps far below; Or be convinced, till awful crisis come,— How far they wander from their heaven and home! We shudder on the brink of this dread truth,— “But Demas hath forsaken me!” And let the lesson both for age and youth Inspired with solemn warning be: He lives for Jesus, who to self hath died And on the Cross beholds it crucified. St. Simon and St. Jude, Apostles. “Grant, us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their doctrine.” —Collect for the Day. “Now let us cleave the heavens with prayer And call avenging fire-blasts down Luke ix. 54. To wither those who madly dare Thus to profane Thine awful Crown!” “Ye know not what your spirit is,” The grave but gentle Mourner cried Who left, to save a wicked world like this, A Throne where He was glorified. Impassion'd bursts of blinding zeal Too often thus the wise betray; And while we hope the Truth they feel, Self-will pursues a sordid way! Incorp'rate with the cause of heaven Not seldom, but how secretly Is found some harsh unholy leaven That poisons what pure love should be! Religion thus conceals a lie, Her glory in our guilt is lost; And, though like John false zealots cry,— 2 Kings x. 16. Blind self becomes their Holy Ghost. But Christ Who was sublime of zeal John ii. 17. Instructs man with divinest lore And bids His mystic Body feel The holy flames He felt before. Attemper'd thus, by prayer controll'd, The vestal-fires of faith within Will make the heart both meek and bold To frustrate all the powers of Sin. As harmony from blended tones A force derives and draws a spell, So Christ in His communion holds Commingled hearts, which serve Him well. Each with peculiar grace supplied Distinctly formed to diff'rent key,— Around that Cross where Jesu died Can blend in perfect unity. Who chose Apostles, two by two, Co-heralds of Incarnate grace, Empower'd them thus because He knew How to attract our heedless race. Head of the Church! in prayer, and praise, In festival and fast divine, To Thee we lift our pleading gaze That love and zeal may both combine By unity of chasten'd powers; And so chastise the stubborn will That all we have, as Thine, not ours,— Shall more and more Thy law fulfil. For faith contend! Jude 3. Lord, grant we may, But not for self, in that disguise; Lest, what we call a heavenly way,— May lead where endless ruin lies! All Saints' Day. “Thine Elect, in one communion and fellowship, in the mystical Body of Thy Son.” —Collect for the Day. Around the Church a spirit-band Of God's elect in glory stand, And faith upon each brow can see The radiance of eternity. The “dust of Jacob” Numb. xxiii. 10. who can count? Or measure its sublime amount, That “goodly fellowship,” th' anointed host,— The heroes of the Holy Ghost? Giants in grace whose weapons were A fearless will, and fast, and prayer,— Valiant in fight, their course they run By gazing on th' eternal Son. “Run with patience ? looking unto Jesus.” —Heb. xii. 1 &amp; 2. Though stoned and mangled, sawn and slain, Heb. xi. 37. They baffled, by enduring, pain; And fiends and foes before them fell Subdued by love's divinest spell. Encompass'd by such living “cloud” Of laurell'd Souls, who never bow'd Under life's burden deep and dread, But bore the cross, and meekly bled,— Heb. xii. 1. “Hither, come up!” Rev. iv. 1. a Voice to-day We hear like choral thunders say From white-robed saints, with palm and crown Through open'd heaven now gazing down.— Patterns they are, almighty Lord! Who, moulded by Thy plastic word, Form types and tokens pure as true Of what victorious grace can do. Yet, like ourselves, on earth they met The pang, the fever, and the fret,— The sorrowing waste and sinful wear Of trials which thy children bear. By passions keen as ours assail'd, Heavenward they soar'd, and never fail'd Through all their mounting track to see A Saviour's eye of sympathy. Awake! then ye who seem to tire, And from our Feast some holy fire Of martyr-love and mighty zeal On this day learn to fan, and feel. These Miracles of true renown Who wield the palm and wear the crown,— What had they from the Church of old Faith cannot in our own behold? Succour without, and strength within, With grace to awe rebellious sin, And eucharistic Manna given Ourselves to feed with food of heaven, Example, precept, promise,—all For hearts which faint or dread to fall The Spirit and the Church provide, And give them in The Crucified. Thus, dead or living, saints are one, Incorp'rate through th' incarnate Son; On earth below in heaven above Communing by celestial love. And they who choose the better part Seem glorified in hope and heart; And where Christ reigns aspire to be Enshrined in peace and purity. HOLY COMMUNION. The Collect. “Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit.” —Prayer Book. The conscious spirit of dejected earth Rom. viii. 22 Hath groan'd and travail'd for that second birth The harp of Prophecy exults to sing And with whose glories David's numbers ring.— Though perfect once, when Adam fell 'Twas wither'd by a wasting spell When down on air and earth and sea Lighted the curse of Deity,— While that dread Nemesis which seized on man Reach'd o'er the world, and through creation ran! Dumb Matter seems intelligently grieved As though it sympathised with man bereaved, In dark remembrance of that Eden-crime When flesh and spirit fell from bliss sublime:— But Nature waits with prescient eye For bridal glories drawing nigh, And thus accords with saints who yearn For throned Emanuel's bright return, When those vile thraldoms that enchain the heart In one vast jubilee of love depart. Isaiah lxi. 1. And hence, in unison with mystic earth, Saints feel the throes of supernat'ral birth,— A deep unrest which inly yearns to share That sinless freedom heaven and hope declare Yet to await Thy Church, O Lord, Where reigns Thy will and rules Thy word; Till not one pulse of heart shall be That throbs with no delight in Thee, While earth and man millennially express A second Eden, graced with holiness. And blest art Thou, maternal Guide for all Who lovingly obey thy creed and call, (Now at the shrine where viewless Angels stand To see men worship as their souls expand— Ephes. iii. 10. Thus to prepare by tones of awe Thy children for omniscient Law Whose purity and precept teach Perfection souls can never reach,— Psalm cxxxix. 6. But still would realise, when faith is true And Christ the Archetype retain'd in view. Thou only Cleanser from indwelling sin, Spirit of purity! thy reign begin; The wav'ring pulses of regen'rate will Though beating homeward, play imperfect, still:— Attracted by contagious power They vibrate through each perill'd hour; While treason-throbs of selfish pride Are often by the heart descried When most it yearns before the Altar-rail To let no Master but the Lord prevail! Heart searching God! Oh, who can thus exclaim, Nor feel the blushes of remorseful shame Pierce through his conscience as with pangs of fire, And silence more than quiv'ring speech inspire— To think of man's Jerem. xvii. 10. denuded heart Cover'd by no concealing art Pierced through and through by That pure Eye Whose beams the sinless angels try!— Alas, for guilt, if when Thy truth be known Men see no Saviour on the mercy-throne! Come then, sole Calmer of our spirit-fears By all Thy sacrifice of Blood and Tears! And so renew us with regen'rate fires That sin may perish, as the saint aspires By thought and action more and more In self to sink, in Christ to soar, And thus ethereally sublime Break from the bonds of space and time, Wing'd on bright hopes which waft him far away To sinless realms where no earth-shadows play. The fetter'd eagle when he feels his chain, Frets at each link, and longs to fly again Far o'er the thunder-cloud in wheeling flight And bathe his plumage in celestial light:— So yearns the saint from sin to part When drags the earth-chain at his heart, And longs with agonising sigh Beyond this flesh-bound world to fly, And in yon heaven of holiness to find A perfect centre for the soaring mind. The Commandments. “Then shall the Priest, turning to the People, rehearse distinctly all the Ten Commandments.” —Rubric. Two Wills the universe divide But One supremely reigns; Or God must be undeified While sin the mast'ry gains. In perfect union limitless, Eternally the same,— Dread glories of almightiness Enshrine Jehovah's Name! Coëqually thus Law and Love Together act and blend, Proceeding from that Power above Who is their source and end. Avaunt, then, ye unhallow'd spells! By whose seductive power Sinai no more its thunder knells Round Satan's tempting hour. An image of Eternal Mind, So far as words can be, The Law reveals to lost mankind Thyself,—transcribed by Thee; By Thee, O God, in Whom to think A moral change can move, Would make the highest angel shrink And darken heaven above! “Thy Law to keep, our hearts incline,” Be this our inmost prayer; And then, will holy radiance shine On all we do, and are. In covenant, though Law be dead, As ruling power, it lives; And children, by the Spirit led, Walk in the light it gives. It glorifies Emmanuel's Blood, Irradiates the Cross; And proves that God is perfect good, And sin, the only loss. Sinai in thunder and in threat Soften'd by Calv'ry's tone,— Both we require, and dare not yet Listen to each alone. Thus ever may omniscient Law Deep in our bosom dwell, And every pulse of passion awe, Or break its guilty spell. O Thou! in whom the Law divine Its perfect Type approved, Chasten our wills to copy Thine And choose what Thou hast loved. Maternal teacher of God's truth, Guardian of glorious creeds,— Thy Church will thus in age and youth Answer immortal needs: Since Love and Law in her express Their unison of aim, And clothe with awful loveliness Jehovah's worshipp'd Name. Collect for the Queen. “Duly considering Whose authority she hath.” —Prayer Book. To this low earth by God are given Shadows of wondrous things in heaven; And by them dim-eyed Man is taught To educate regen'rate thought, And rise, by Truth's ascending scale, To where in light and life prevail Those archetypes of perfect bliss Which in the breast of Godhead dwell:— And Christ ordain'd a creed like this His Church should hold, and guard it well. Vast Nature in her varied path A sacramental meaning hath; Soil, air and sun, and moon and sea Are parable and poetry Divinely-touch'd with teaching powers, To symbolise in sacred hours Mysterious works which God and grace Are in the realm of Spirit acting, Till earth becomes a hallow'd place An endless liturgy transacting. Why marvel, then, that King and Queen Have ever in our temples been Enshrined, amid due praise and prayer, And hymn'd in high memorials, there? Since regal power reflects to man A scepter'd image of that plan Where Monarchy Incarnate rules.— Thus, kingly brows our faith reveres, And by obedience conscience schools A loyal heart for higher spheres. The witchcraft of rebellion, 1 Sam. xv. 23. Lord, Is blasted by thy searing Word! “The Powers that be” from heaven derive Sanctions, from whence they fitly strive To helm the pride of lawless will And bid fraternal Man fulfil All duties awful justice owns, Which bind us each to each in love:— And hence, we learn from human thrones To bend before The Throne above. Princes involve a public Heart Where empires own a vital part; The type, the standard, and the tone Of morals,—in them myriads own, And as they seem to rise or fall Virtues or vices sway us all: Thus, Church and State in concord meet, Act and re-act, for weal or woe, And saints around the Mercy-seat To both express how much they owe. Lord of all Lords, Thou King of Kings, Whose Throne around that anthem rings Whose sempiternal lauds proclaim That Holy! Holy! is Thy Name,— Shield Thine adoring Church who prays, And lifts to Thee her asking gaze. In Thy dread Hand “The hearts of kings are in thy rule and governance” —Collect. imperial hearts Are beating, for mysterious sway; And secret grace a power imparts To keep the pure and perfect way. And while Britannia's ancient crown Beams o'er the world with bright renown, Let thought and will, and word and deed So in the light of Law proceed, That Monarchy in heart and mind To God and glory be inclined: For then will Church and Crown express Distinct but undivided worth, And mercies brighten while they bless The Land of their associate birth. The first of Subjects, John v. 30. as of Kings,— Emmanuel His obedience brings To awe rebellion into dread By fury or by faction led, When rampant wills that Law decline Which proved, O Lord! perfection Thine: Rather by meekness let us learn Man's crowning grace in Christ to see, And from His life this law discern,— Obedience is true liberty. Collect, Epistle, and Gospel for the Day. “Then shall be said the Collect of the day. And immediately after, the Priest shall read the Epistle ? then shall be read the Gospel.” —Rubric. Scripture, the spirit,—form the Church imparts Of true religion to baptisèd hearts Who on her creed and counsel live, And aye with filial rev'rence give Both faith and feeling to that watchful care,— Whether we soar on praise, or sink in contrite prayer. Thus at the Altar by maternal voice She warns her children; and with trembling choice A threefold Collect, Epistle, and Gospel. spell electeth now To bring upon the heart and brow Solemnity,—which marks each awing word Wafted from lips ordain'd in Thy blest Name Oh Lord! Coëval with past Liturgies whose tone Breathes a pure strain Apostles seem to own,— Is that dread Rite wherein we learn Myst'ries divine, which saints discern Who on that sacrifice by faith can feed Where Christ himself becomes the Nourishment they need. Thus did the Jew his paschal feast partake And into worship grateful mem'ry wake By reading—how the Angel swept O'er Egypt's clime, and safely kept Beneath his plumes in that passover-flight The blood-saved host of God, whom heaven preserved by night. And, like the mission'd Seventy, who were sent To herald forth the great Omnipotent, Select Epistles now declare His Advent; and the heart prepare By truths and tones which harbinger the way For that Incarnate Love which feeds our souls to-day. Now, “Glory be to Thee and Thine, O Lord,” Such be that strain through all our temples pour'd!— A God in language cometh He Whose Gospel breathes of Deity, Where not a syllable but burns and glows With that celestial might His majesty bestows. And let adoring myriads at the sound Rise with due awe; and while the aisles rebound With choral echoes loud and long, Still may consenting hearts prolong That laud of glory unto Jesu given,— Throned in our temples now, as truly as in heaven. By gesture thus we symbolise to man Far as mere body unto spirit can, Both rev'rent mind and ready will Our Lord to worship, and fulfil His kingly precepts with heroic zeal Whatever be that doom the royal Law reveal. A verbal eucharist are words divine Whose depths a sacramental God enshrine; And hence those hearts can inly feed And satisfy immortal need, Who in such paschal food of language share Realities which prove Emanuel present there. Nicene Creed. “The Gospel ended, shall be sung or said the Creed following.” —Rubric. When from the Past we lift that hoary pall Which mantles time and space and scene And in some resurrection-dream recall The buried grandeurs that have been,— Dead Empires quicken with historic breath And life comes wafted from a world of death. But what so thrills us with admiring awe As deeds and darings, that display'd God's heroes in the Church which martyrs saw, When, resting on no mutual aid, They witness'd unto blood that Creed divine Where all pure doctrines in the Cross combine? Thus, when for council, Rome's converted king Summon'd the listening East and West, In pledge of faith-born unity, to bring A Symbol where all Churches rest,— Seldom has Hist'ry Consult Sozomen and Theodoret. unto hearts unroll'd Such touching grandeurs as we there behold! Then, maim'd and marr'd by heathen wound The Apostolic watchmen came, And in one league of living virtue bound All who adored their Master's Name,— Ever to keep by falsehood undefiled The Creeds which sanctify both man and child. And can we doubt, those Priests and Prelates hoary Enthroned amid the palace-hall, Eclipse all gods who reign in human story And round whose thrones adorers fall,— And thus, unpurified by fast or prayer, Mistake for glory what is sinful glare! But what these mitred witnesses proclaim'd Our sacred Mother echoes still: By crushing Wrong unsilenced and unshamed,— In faith she has no choosing will, But hands unmarr'd that true Deposit down Which consecrates alike her cross and crown. Nor let the worshipper of godless Mind With mocking wonder, question how Renew'd confessions in the Church can bind Our hearts to keep their holy vow:— Not to inform, but to affect the Man, Proves the deep wisdom of our Church's plan. Hence repetition is the law of growth; Not light, but love, souls mainly need: And ancient Liturgies provide for both By concord of a double Creed,— Apostles' and Nicene Creed. Where each to each imparts some genial tone Whose true distinctness makes communion known. Confession is of creeds the vocal life; Rom. x. 10. Without it, none in Christ are saved; Baptised for conflict, superhuman strife Heroic saints have nobly braved; Nor breathes there in the Host elect on high One spirit that will dare the Creeds deny. Salvation's Captain! though a Prince of Peace, Under Thy banner we are met And, panoplied by grace, will never cease To lift that spirit-war-cry yet— “My love was crucified; and I must be Lord of my will! self-crucified with Thee.” A perfect touchstone and a probing test The Church for souls hath thus supplied; And searchingly by symbols now confest The treach'rous depth of conscience tried,— Lest haply in some vague and vast “believe” Our suicidal hearts themselves deceive. So in the face of earth and hell and heaven Let saints and fiends and angels hear A full-toned witness to our “Credo!” given,— Which falters with no coward fear But upward soaring with resistless flight Enters the ears of Him Who dwells in light. Almighty Feeder of the famish'd soul Both Priest and Sacrifice in one, Shed o'er Thine Altar a sublime control Till heaven, by holiness begun,— Inly transform the sacrificial mind And Saints adore Thee, Ephes. iii. 17. in themselves enshrined. Offertory. “Begin the Offertory.” —Rubric. When Death itself on Calv'ry died Hosannah! wond'ring Angels cried Who saw in that abyss of love A Miracle unknown above,— God in depression!—'Twas a sight Whose dreadful glories, over-bright, Seem'd to appal their wing-veil'd eyes As though the earth outshone the skies. Thus, mystic radiance robes the Cross, And in the depths of Adam's loss The Incarnation bids us see All grace can do and God can be. But still in vain, with verbal glow Mere lips of doctrine overflow, If no true sacrifice can seal By outward stamp our inward zeal. The christian Altar claims a trine Of blended acts, in which combine Forgiveness, charity, and gift,— Which up to heaven the heart uplift. Alas for us, if formal grown, A fast or sigh, or tears alone, Be all th' oblations men can bring Who call The Crucified their King! Fasting and Alms,—between them stands Devotion, when the mind expands, And plumed on double wing would rise To greet Her Master in the skies. And did not He by Whom we live Himself as passive off'ring give, And bid us on His mystic shrine Love-tokens lay of truth divine? Bright centre of consummate love! Whence radiate to worlds above Expressions of almighty grace Eternity will not erase,— Thou Cross! the crest of Calvary, Religion moves and breathes in Thee; And they are mockers dead and cold Who do not in Thy light behold A Model and a Motive pure, Of sin and self the perfect cure,— Transforming with a spell divine The hearts which rest, oh Lord! on Thine. And days have bloom'd, when such the zeal Enrapt adorers lov'd to feel, That jewell'd vestments rich and rare, Charters and Deeds, combined with prayer, And Lands and Rev'nues,—all encrown'd The christian Altar, and around The central Presence of The Lord A wealth of boundless worship pour'd. But times prevail, when lip and life, To God reveal an impious strife; The first,—celestial in its tone, The last,—is self, and self alone! Blest Giver of enlarging grace Regenerate the human race; And on Thy Cross, before we die Our earth-chain'd feelings crucify, Till body soul and spirit be A holocaust of love to Thee, While soaring prayers like incense rise To consecrate the sacrifice. Offertory-Sentences. “Begin the Offertory, saying one or more of these sentences.” Rubric. Divine Parnassus for the priests of song To whom all consecrated harps belong, Mountain of grace, mysterious Calvary! May ev'ry minstrel's heaven-toned lyre Tell how Thy glories can inspire The might and magic of true poetry. But, crested by the holy Cross, thou art A more than Poem to the pure in heart, Whose inward-vision sees that Symbol there, Whence sacramental meanings flow That kindle adoration's glow,— Melting with praise or murmur'd into prayer. Yet, throbs and thrills emotional and keen, Like those awaken'd by some wonder-scene Where tragedy excites and tears reply,— What are they more than fairy gleams Which fascinate our earth-born dreams And cheat the conscience with bright mockery? No life is felt, except devoted love The Will can crucify for Christ above, Whose Cross transfigures all its spells can reach:— Who touches it, a virtue gains That o'er his inmost fibre reigns And tells him truths, which Martyrs died to teach! But should'st thou waver in some unwatch'd hour, Nor feel Thy Saviour's crucifying power Soften the heart with love's o'ermast'ring sway,— The Church accosts thee with a tone Maternal, such as infants own When erring fancies lead young feet astray. In vain by litanies we cry “oh, Lord!” And mock His Throne with man's beseeching word Lull'd by the lip-work of a fruitless prayer;— Oblations Christ and Church require To mingle with that spirit-fire The living altar of the heart feeds there. All Saints are jewels in Emanuel's Crown, Gems of His Church by glory and renown, The talk of angels and the theme of heaven: But in that list the martyr'd poor Who faint beside the rich man's door Are most like Him, to Whom such lot was given! Blest be her wisdom then, who, ere we lift Our hands to hold God's everlasting Gift Here in His Eucharist of dying love,— With urgency divinely-true Opens the heavens for hearts to view The Lord of charity enshrined above. Preluding strains may thus the mind prepare For more devotion than mere lips declare; While Faith o'erawed, upon adoring knees, Under that veil of mystic Food Which garbs “The Body and the Blood,” Her God in sacrificial glory sees. Lord of true sacrifice! Thou Lamb of souls, When charity like Thine the heart controls How dear the sad, and how sublime the poor! Spirits on fire, then inly melt As though their inmost centre felt Christ forming Gal. iv. 17. in them, Whom their lips adore. Prayer for the Church Militant. “Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth.” —Rubric. Thou dread Supreme! an unimagined God The Source and End of beings all, Under the shadow of Whose sceptral rod Ordain'd creations rise and fall,— To Thine eternity of boundless love Our blending adorations rise And in that Priest of priests Who prays above Heb. vii. 25. Hails the deep Heart which echoes all her sighs! Now while the alms upon Thine Altar rest For consecration pure and true, To yon calm region of the bright and blest In faith we lift an asking view,— That charity beyond our alms may reach And act the Saviour's part, Whose tones of Mercy to His kingdom teach The holy largeness of a loving heart. In this behold a miracle of prayer! Timeless and boundless it extends; And, wing'd by omnipresence, everywhere Circles alike both foes and friends:— Far as the pulse of mortal nature beats Or feeble man is known or found, For ransom'd souls the sainted Church entreats Till answ'ring mercies brighten and abound. But for the Mystic Body of the Lord Here militant on earth below, Intensely be our true devotions pour'd And kindled with seraphic glow; Since all around her marshall'd forces wait To overwhelm her cause and creed, And crush the holiness harsh worldlings hate When Christ is rev'renced as our grandest need. But, Truth is panoplied by arms divine; And saints beside the Altar kneeling Heroic graces from God's inner-shrine Feel o'er their hearts sublimely stealing; And while their soaring intercessions rise Like angel-wings to worlds on high, Emmanuel gives from His almighty store, Victorious energies which never die! And not for living saints alone we pray With deepest intercession, now; But for the dead and dear long pass'd away Is gently heard the low-breathed vow. What, though the perfect bliss which Christ imparts Surpasses all earth calls divine, And heaven is mirror'd by those sinless hearts Pillow'd in peaceful rapture, Lord, on Thine,— Yet as of old amid sepulchral gloom The heroes of the Cross were number'd, And more than glory round each martyr-tomb Hallow'd the scene wherein they slumber'd, So would our Church commemorate the Dead True in her faith who bravely died, By fellowship with those who burn'd and bled And sang, hosannah! to the Crucified. Oh, ye, the bodiless, the bright, the blest Who never sin and no more die, Yours is the pangless home of perfect rest In bowers of bloom beyond the sky!— No tears, no troubles mar that placid joy A soul beatified must feel, Whom heaven and holiness employ While glory-visions round your spirit steal. How loved ye are! and still to faith alive; And present oft, when sad and lone Pale mourners who must weep and strive, Bearing some voiceless pang unknown,— In musing walk and melancholy hour The dead to life recall again; Or when deep music's resurrection-power Seems to revive them in some magic strain! But most we realise the living dead When round the Altar faith adores Her God Incarnate, Who empowers the Bread, And hallow'd wine His Priesthood pours; For then the Church her full Communion shares And time and flesh become a name, And saints, one Body,—whom The Lord declares On earth united, and in heaven the same. The Warning Prayer. “Consider the dignity of that holy mystery, and the great peril of the unworthy receiving thereof.” —Prayer Book. When dark and deep on haggard conscience lie The haunting shadows of eternity, No lustre but thy radiant word Can roll them off, divinest Lord! For in the truth of that atoning grace (A bleeding God embodied for our race) Mercy conceals a vaster gift Than lauding Angels can uplift. Transcending praise, its awful virtue is So infinitely stored with perfect bliss, Heaven cannot boast more heavenly food,— Than Jesu's Body, and His Blood! Mysterious elements! Celestial feast, Where saints the loftiest, and of souls the least Renew their pardon round the Cross And count the world, without it, loss,— Well hath the Church in her most jealous awe Fenced Thee around by reverential law; Lest haply with unheeding mind The sinful come where God is shrined. For if when sandall'd Moses once drew nigh A miracle to scan with daring eye, “Thy shoes remove from off thy feet” Protected then God's mercy-seat,— Not less a warning christian hearts require: For He who dwelt in sacramental fire, Now in that paschal myst'ry lives Where Christ His own Passover gives. Three days of tempest thunder and thick cloud Exod. xix. 15. When Sinai quaked beneath the trumpet loud, Usher'd the Law, 'ere down it came In darkness, Deity, and flame! Nor was there festival, where did not sound Peals which awoke creation's heart around, From clanging trumps, whose choral swell Was echoed back by Israel. And can we, who on God Incarnate feed, In times of weaken'd faith, less warning need Our souls to thrill with tender awe, Who see what Moses never saw? For on the Altar of His Cross we find The sacrifice and Saviour of Mankind Under the veiling bread and wine Imparted, by His Word divine. Danger and duty with associate might Haunt the dread region of this holy rite; And may our watching Priests be bold Like great St. Ambrose,—who of old Cried to the blood-stain'd Monarch, “doff thy crown; In sackcloth, not in purple, kneel thee down, And thus abide, and bear thy stain Till tears have wash'd thee white again!” By glorious discipline divine as true Thus may all souls be taught their sins to rue, And let some dreadless Voice declare Due penitence, by fast and prayer. But should the cowardice of conscience fail And heart-confession shrink to rend the veil, While dimness, doubt, and mystery, Dark sinner! overshadow thee,— Then, to some meek confessor “Let him come to me and open his grief.” (“Exhortation” in Prayer Book.) sadly hie And in his ear thy bosom'd anguish sigh, And from absolving lips receive Councils that heal the hearts which grieve. Though not by pardons vendible and vile Our priesthood reigns with superstitious guile, Still hath the Church from heaven derived High gifts, for which her martyrs strived. Thou saving Teacher of the Truth and Way, Spirit of Jesus! unto Thee we pray; And duly in the Church's tone Would hear an echo of Thine Own. Beneath the searching radiance of thy word Let each wrong impulse be so rightly stirr'd That, from all guilt and guile set free, And graced with perfect charity,— With rev'rence at this feast of faith divine Lamb of Jehovah! both on Thee and Thine Devout communicants may feed, And through Thy merit pray and plead: While each partaker of The Crucified In living oneness with His Lord allied, Makes the whole Church appear to be A mortal shrine for Deity. Cor. vi. 16. Exhortation. “For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so lovingly called.” —Prayer Book. As to their eye a soft refreshment yields The green expression of romantic fields When town-worn minds a rural glimpse enjoy, Far from the fev'rish world's impure alloy,— The shaded aisle of hoar'd Cathedral throws A calming beauty and a chaste repose On some lone heart, escaping from the roar Of turmoil'd cities, through the temple-door. Like monuments and memories they stand Of Past and Present worship through the land,— Those tow'ring Shrines, which point to heaven and say, “Yonder is Home, and here, the hallow'd way.” Yet, in this work-day world of grinding care The people perish for the lack of prayer; Gold, more than God, their true almighty seems, And sensual good the summit of their dreams! Thus are we changed by Mammon-worship, now: The binding spells of our baptismal vow Too rarely wield their awfulness of truth O'er ripen'd age or unreflecting youth. In olden times, a daily priesthood spread The mystic banquet of immortal Bread And Wine mysterious,—where Himself imparts The God Incarnate to communing hearts. But now by prayerless Apathy forsaken Our temples stand; and there, by few partaken,— The sabbath-eucharists divinely feed Our fainting hunger in some hour of need. “Savingly-called,” and by the Lord Himself, We hear no charmer but the cry of self; And almost guestless that high Table stands Whose feast is spread by uncreated Hands! Lamb of our God! of men the Life and Light, And is it thus we scorn that wondrous Rite Where all blent graces of The Cross combine In that dread unity, whose source is Thine? “This do,”—how often, Christ did not decree Because in faith our sacrifice is free; And in the largeness of devoted will A true remembrance can alone fulfil That dying summons the Redeemer gave,— To feed on Him, who came the lost to save: Alas, that our apostate souls require More than “do this,” devotion to inspire! But come thou, and celestial warnings give Church of that Lord on Whom thy members live; Chide, pleading Mother! till the coldest feel Some kindled embers of reviving zeal. The feign'd excuse of each reluctant soul Subdue, and silence with ordain'd control; Thrill the dead conscience with a pang of love And point contrition to its Priest above.” Did men remember, who th' Inviter is And in that Banquet how divine the bliss, Where Food eternal for the famish'd heart Incarnate! in Thy sacrament Thou art,— Sure, they would need no eloquence to charm A slumb'ring conscience out of fatal harm: One glimpse of Thine own Altar, gracious Lord, Would rouse them more than Sinai's thunder-word! Then would Thy saints and angels meet In constant access round that Mercy-seat Where dead and living, by communion one, Blend and embrace in God's almighty Son. Especial Exhortation. “As the benefit is great ? so is the danger great.” Prayer Book. Those stars that by the language of their beams Form living syllables of light, Whereby we spell in reverential dreams The name of Godhead on the book of Night,— Oft as their gem-like radiance gleams on high Amid the hush which is sublime, Devotion reads with faith's perusing eye Lessons which lift her out of space and time. But, most regen'rate hearts will muse on Him Who oft beneath some midnight-star Soar'd beyond earth, and with the seraphim Knelt round the Throne where God and glory are. And doubt we not, that in the trance of night On some calm mountain, still and cold, The Man of Sorrows by prophetic sight His mystic Body did in prayer behold,— Before Whose eyes in perfect outline stood Myriads unborn, but doom'd to be, Who in the Church by sacramental food Feed their true souls on suff'ring Deity. Oh, blessed thought! whose inspirations fill A trembling neophyte with joy, And when he seeks to do the Saviour's will Kindles bright hopes no shading fears destroy.— To think that in this very act perchance When round the Altar first he kneels And on the symbols darts a dreading glance, Christ has foreseen what awed emotion feels! And Thou art there; and at our side to calm Church of the Lord! by whisper'd love Each wounded heart that needs the holy balm Thine intercessions bring from bowers above. Now while adoring guests of God advance In heavenward awe and hush'd array, Spirit of Truth! may thy celestial glance Beam through the soul and melt all clouds away. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Whose ransom saved the forfeit soul When ruin'd nature, by rebellion lost, Heard dooming thunders of dread vengeance roll, Let each communicant in Christ uplift On plumes of prayer the soaring heart; And God Himself will be that boundless gift His awful Sacrament will now impart. The Invitation. “Draw near with faith, and take this Holy Sacrament.” Prayer Book. Beloved of heaven! now draw ye nigh Array'd in robes of charity, (Your sacrifice, a weeping heart) Who with repentance deep and stern Would all the guilty past unlearn And choose in Christ the “better part.” A filial awe, not slavish fear Each soul becomes that banquets here Upon mysterious Bread and Wine; Under whose shrouding vesture lies A Presence, which no carnal eyes Can witness in that wondrous Shrine. Such manna of celestial food Is not for angels, bright and good Whom bleeding death-pangs never bought; But contrite sinners there may feed And find what lulls each aching need With nourishment divinely-fraught. Repent ye, with a perfect will Touch'd by the Cross,—resolved to fill Your onward life with praise and prayer; So may ye take the meal ye dread, Who hunger for that mystic Bread Children of God in Jesus share. But not the Church can conscience reach; Her wisdom is, to guide and teach;— Man's inward virtue still must be A depth unknown, except to Him With Whom transcendent Cherubim Are but created vanity! Dread Searcher of the deepest heart! Who in Thy pure omniscience art Reading all spirits through and through,— In vain would cow'ring saints conceal Emotions which the purest feel When prostrate in Thy perfect view. Rather in self-accusing blame Renounce they ev'ry mortal claim, And simply for Salvation trust On Him who by atonement died And by that death, as crucified, Lifted man out of guilt and dust. Jesus invites each guest to-day: And by Himself (the living Way), Kneeling adorer, draw thee nigh. In Christ be calm; His comfort take Who agonised for thy dear sake, And heavenward lift the fainting eye. Of this be sure,—no seraph-tone Warbled around His radiant Throne, Can thrill that ever-human chord Which vibrates in Emanuel's breast,— Like sighs to Him from saints who rest And glory in His living Word; For, by the Incarnation we Converge far nearer Deity Than angels, who around Him shine:— Sinless they are, but saints are one Communion with th' Eternal Son, Adored as human and divine. General Confession. “Make your humble confession to Almighty God, meekly kneeling upon your knees.” —Prayer Book. Father of grace! almighty King, O'er us Thy kneeling suppliants now Let Mercy wave her softest wing, While we recall that broken vow Which, since baptismal life began, Hath stain'd the child and sullied man. Confession is Thy pardon-law By which our guilt may be reversed; And never saint forgiveness saw Who did not by bewailment first His conscience through confession ease, And seek for Christ, the sole release. With deepest prayer and downcast eye And litany of soul-drawn tears, Lamb of the Church! to Thee we cry And in Thy merit hide our fears:— Unnumber'd though our sins be found, Thy mercies have no bar, nor bound. Yes, child of guilt! when Jesus died The awful death of bleeding love, While darkness o'er The Crucified Fell from Almighty frowns above,— Jehovah did Himself proclaim The sanctions which enshrine His Name. Thus, Healer of the contrite heart, In Thine atoning Blood we find The perfect Antitype Thou art Of all that soothes and saves Mankind, When underneath the Cross we groan And cast our guilt on Christ alone. Justice and Mercy, both in Thee By miracle of union meet; And not a ray of Deity But shines around that mercy-seat, Where on His Throne of priesthood reigns A Paraclete for all our pains. Repentance and renewal, Lord, Together grant, and thus bestow The balm which Thy benignant word Hath promised for that hour of woe When conscience echoes back the cry,— “The soul that sinneth, it shall die!” Absolution. “Then shall the Priest (or the Bishop, being present) stand up, and turning himself to the People, pronounce this absolution.” —Rubric. Will God indeed my forfeit-soul forgive?”— Eternity would one dread echo be, Except the Lord, with Whom all spirits live, Waft from His Throne an answer back to thee Pale questioner!—o'erwhelm'd with dismal awe When guilt is darken'd by the light of law. Such was the problem, whose perturbing gloom Shaded the heart of many a moral sage, When through his doubt there yawn'd a distant tomb And conscience shudder'd with a dread presage:— Hereafter wore the blackness of despair And threaten'd nought but retribution there. Oft in some boundless dream when sacred Thought Seem'd to unfold her wings and soar to God, Mounting with more than mortal wisdom fraught, As though divine Imagination trod Pathways of glory lined by Angel-bands Who bore it upward with sustaining hands,— Back to the grave when guilt again return'd How must those ethic bards of Greece and Rome For some Revealer in that hour have yearn'd, The way to open whence the pardons come,— Which now the channels of The Church impart With perfect clearness to each contrite heart. Sublime of privilege!—if grateful love Would reason less and learn to worship more; Looking through man to Him, Whose heart above Shrines in its depths an everlasting store Of comforts, promised through His Priests below To all who see Him while their mercies flow. Christ in His Church an omnipresence is, By realising faith divinely known; And none deny the sacramental bliss Of sharing there what sight can never own,— But intellectual Cains, whose creedless mind Murders the truth, to make their conscience blind. Children of God, elect of grace, draw nigh, Not in the orphanhood of guilt remain; Fix on yon mercy-seat your lifted eye And lo, the Lord! in Whom compassions reign; That true Absolver, o'er whose face benign God though He is, love marks its human line. Go, and rehearse heaven's pardon, thou, And like a Nathan at God's altar stand Priest of the Lord!—by absolution now Bid the rich graces of the Cross expand, That lapsèd souls by sinful earth depraved, From guilt unbound, no more may be enslaved. Here is Heaven's balm to heal the wounded mind, When truth and tenderness together blend; While, (fraught with mercies which release mankind), Fresh from Christ's heart those righteous pardons wend,— Where peace and pureness are alike divine And God and Man both savingly combine. Comfortable Words. “Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith.” Rubric. The sacraments an incarnation are By Him extended to the Church in prayer With Whom, as members of His Body, we Incorp'rate grow Ephes. v. 30. through blest eternity. But oh, celestial Love! round craven souls When echo'd Sinai through dark mem'ry rolls Her legal thunders,—all that grace can do They need to testify their pardon true. So great our guilt, by sin of life and lips, It seems to shadow in one dread eclipse A throned Almighty, and in darkness hide The vast atonement God Himself supplied! The lash of conscience is a fearful thing: And Law and Reason but combine to wring Torture and tears from those pale souls which see The lurid flames of lost eternity. Hence must true faith beside God's altar feed On the dread sacrifice our spirits need; Where none are soothed and soften'd into love Except they build on sympathy above. Heb. ii. 17, 18. No shieldless warrior See Tacit. Mor. Germ. in the German host Who in the fight his cov'ring armour lost Was e'er permitted on the forest-shrine To place the sacrifice they call'd divine: Still less can faith-less sorrow view the Lord Although embodied in His living Word, Till the rent clouds of blind dejection part And hope's bright dayspring dawns within the heart. Sublime consoler with maternal tone,— Hark, how the Church our griefs can own By words of balm, whose healing magic throws Round the sad children more than man's repose. Bland Sentences of most benignant power Her wisdom culls to sooth this aching hour,— Tender and deep as that dread love which cried “Forgive them!” and in bleeding mercy died. “Come unto Me, thou heavy-laden heart!”— Still in those words, inviting Lord Thou art; And heavenward penitence by prayer will find Such truths an anchor to sustain the mind. Lost in ourselves, but in Emanuel found, Thy mercies brighten though our sins abound; And all who crucify the flesh-born Will Bleed for their Master on some Calv'ry still, But in that death a resurrection gain Where heaven and holiness commence their reign; While love and likeness more and more begin Christ to enthrone o'er every thought within. O Thou Who art our being's central home, Ark of pure rest to Whom the “perfect” come, Where John was pillow'd John xiii. 5. let the Church repose And feel the calm Thy “finish'd” Work bestows. The Trisagion. “Evermore praising Thee, and saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts.” —Prayer Book. Thrilling with an inward glory Light of light! elate before Thee Lifted in heart absolvèd spirits stand; And like angels overawed While they chant the choral laud,— In loud Trisagions feel their souls expand. Melodies of paschal mirth Now become their spirit-birth Who in this Festival of pardon meet,— Heart and voice too here uplift Lauding God's eternal gift Which brightens o'er them from the mercy-seat. Low on earth while guilt remains, Let the pardon'd soar in strains Which thrill the heavens, and with angelic quires Around the Throne triumphant Blend their voices jubilant,— Welcomed by Him Whose praise their harp inspires. Meet and right it is to sing And with hearts thus worshipping Circle the shrine where our Passover lies; While in words whose mystic tone Proto-martyrs loved to own God-ward ascends the oral sacrifice! Time nor scene contain that heart Unto which all gifts impart A sense immortal of Thy goodness, Lord!— What is life, but love to Thee In divine Humanity, Our will Thy wisdom, and our law Thy word? But the temple-courts do most Kindle Thine adoring host To hymn th' Incarnate with melodious bliss: There what inspirations glow While above, around, below Spells not of earth array an hour like this! Aisled cathedrals dimly-glorious Haunted by saints who sang before us Well may we dream,—while vaulted arches ring, And before each echoing shrine Lauds and litanies divine Worship and wonder in full chorus bring. Holy! Holy! Holy One! Boundless, Endless, Unbegun, In Threefold Unity the God of all,— While archangels Thee adore Seraph-like our hearts would soar And with their company “our Father,” call. Heaven and earth are full of Thee Lord of dread eternity Throned in Thyself unutterably bright! But in Christ Thy children dare Offer Thee both praise and prayer, And see how Love can mitigate that Light Which would blast them!—but for Him By Whom saints and seraphim Blend in one family of blissful joy; And round 'mortal shrines can blend Anthem'd strains which never end, But through eternity their harps employ. With them, like them, let us sing, Who entranced on outspread wing Warble and worship round Thy burning Throne: Feebly though our music float Falt'ring with imperfect note,— Heaven holds One heart the Church may call her own! Thine it is, Thou King of Glory! Nor can angels hymn before Thee A chant more grateful, though in purer strain: Boldly therefore let us chant And with chorus jubilant Cry “Holy!” till the heavens respond again! Thought of dread, for words too deep, Let it in mute wonder sleep,— Angels are kneeling round yon Altar-shrine! Though their lustres none can see, Over man their wings may be And shade the spirit with a spell divine. Prefaces. “Then shall be read the Proper Preface, according to the time.” Rubric. Undeafen'd by the world's harsh din True souls can hear The Christ within For ever murm'ring with melodious voice “Make God thy glory and His Will thy choice.” Where'er these sainted pilgrims roam Thou art, O Lord! their heaven and home— That only Centre for an aching breast By sorrow darken'd or by guilt depress'd. The pangs but not the palms of mind They bear, because they bless mankind By teaching, what an impious world denies,— That holy life is one long sacrifice. But for the Church, those hearts would break Who only live for Thy dear sake, Finding no echoes to their deepest mood And in the crowd,—a mental solitude! To them, at best, man's hidden life Is harrow'd by mysterious strife; Sighs more than songs interpret what they feel, Who hide the wounds the world-slaves would reveal. Not cold, but calm, such spirits are Who purify the earth by prayer, And on mock pleasure which the gay pursue Mark the bright transience of the morning-dew! And yet though life a Baca Psalm lxxxiv. 6. seems, A weeping valley of false dreams, Saints have their “wells” of unpolluted joy Which flow with freshness Time cannot alloy. Such are the festivals they greet Who round the christian Altar meet Viewless adorers,—whose seraphic bliss Blends with their own, and from a source like this Derives accessions deep as true,— Because the highest angels view In Christ those glories of consummate love Which deepen Ephes. iii. 10. wisdom in the world above. All mercies round The Cross entwined The Church reveres with grateful mind: But as one star another star outbeams, Surpassing lustre in those five there gleams She now commemorates with praise,— Whose tones are caught from festal days When from the cradled God on earth we rise That Three-in-One to chant beyond the skies! With angels and archangels we Thus celebrate The Trinity; And, hymning Father Son and Holy Ghost, Blend our earth-worship with that sinless host Who on the Throne for evermore Jehovah the Triune adore,— And cause the arches of bright heaven to ring With rolling echoes which resound their King. The Address. “We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness.” —Prayer Book. Encircl'd by mysterious awe The legal mount of Sinai rear'd Its clouded vastness, when the Law In symbols of dread light appear'd:— Religion view'd it with alarmèd soul And round its lurid heights heard pealing thunders roll! Who touch'd with sacrilegious hand Its sainted borders, died the death! For man and beast alike were bann'd From soiling with their sinful breath That guarded precinct, where exceeding-loud The trumpet-clang was heard from out the riven cloud. And when the wav'ring Ark to hold The unanointed Uzzah tried, His crime was impious and so bold That in the very act he died!— Thus hath our God by symbol word or sign For rev'rence set apart what He declares divine. But Mount nor Ark can e'er appeal To faith with such celestial awe, As that which thrills adoring zeal With more than kings and prophets saw,— When Christ Himself by sacrament imparts And feeds with mystic food our eucharistic hearts. Not in ourselves as guilty dust Presume we now while drawing nigh,— To cultivate a holy trust; But rather with compunction sigh, And meekly in the depths of Mercy find Some anchor of sure hope to calm unsteady mind. So grant us, Lord, thy Flesh to eat And Thine atoning Blood to drink, That while we own ourselves unmeet And in the dust of anguish sink,— Pardon'd and purified true saints may live On that immortal Bread Thy bleeding merits give. For could men pure as angels be Or rival seraphim with love, What countless sins Those Eyes could see Which read the heart in heaven above! But man's affections are, at best, infirm, And he has most of faith who feels himself a “worm.” Psalm xxii. 6. O Thou by Whose ethereal fire All inward dross is purged away, Now let Thy fervency inspire Our longing hearts to love and pray,— Spirit of Christ! by Whom the Cross alone To man's reluctant will can make its virtue known. Each low and languid pulse of thought Touch'd by pure grace soon throbs for Thee; And nerveless minds by guilt unwrought Soar God-ward, when from sin set free And those dull cares which chain the wingèd heart And bind its flames to earth when they for heaven depart. The Consecration. “Break the Bread before the people, and take the Cup.” —Rubric. “This is my Body ? This is my Blood.” —Prayer Book. The universe with all its powers Of life and motion, sound and sight, Far as fleet time can waft the hours Or thought pursue a boundless flight,— Though unbelieved by sense-adoring man Has minister'd to Christ, since grace on earth began. He is the Body whence proceed All shadows signs and symbols found To image forth the truths men need,— Above, beneath, the earth around; That faith in all things may atonement find And learn how matter can be consecrate to mind. And hence the types mere sense can view Though far removed from nature's law, Are in accordance deep and true With more than reason ever saw,— Since underneath their veiling shroud can be The Body and the Blood which died on Calvary By mystic virtue present there;— And emblem'd in that priestly rite Where man prolongs that deathless prayer Christ offered on His paschal night, When He became our Sacrifice complete And on atoning pangs enthroned His mercy-seat. We need not then, O Lord, enquire As Abram's darling did of old,— “Father! I see the wood and fire But where the destined lamb behold?” For on faith's altar inward eyes can view Th' unbleeding Antitype of more than patriarchs knew. In substance bread and wine are still The creatures of Thy forming Hand; But in the Church they must fulfill That sacrament dread words command, Whose consecrating force by heavenly law Encircles ev'ry shrine with sacerdotal awe. The bread Thine awful Hands did take, And with the cup Thou didst the same, And as the one those Hands did break On both that consecration came All christian priests, where'er Thine altars rise, With echoing awe repeat when call'd to sacrifice. Thus, Priest of God, go, take thy stand To minister before the Shrine; And, charter'd by supreme command, Now break the bread and bless the wine, And by that gift of Body and of Blood Feed every famish'd soul with supernat'ral food. We “come!”—but, not untrembling, Lord; And while around Thine Altar kneeling Would be o'erwhelm'd, except Thy word Cried “peace,” to our perturbèd feeling,— Blent with the hope, that by remembrance we Eternalise that Cross which once was borne by Thee. The passion of Thy priestly death Is imaged by that Bread and Wine, Which bid recipients hush their breath, As if some thrill of grace divine Moved the deep soul with sacramental law Whose finest chords are touch'd, and tremble into awe! Eternal Sacrifice! be still our Food And feed Thy fainting Church below, Who on Thy Body and thy Blood Through forty days and nights of woe Like sad Elijah, in a world of sin Divinely is sustained by manna from within. 1 Kings xix. 8. Communion. “The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life.” —Prayer Book. Tis silence, Lord, when some deep pulse of prayer Throbs in the heart, by all unheard but Thee! While lips anointed by the Truth declare “Do this, and thus by faith remember Me.” Deepens that silence, when with noiseless glide The vested priesthood round Thine altar goes, To give the emblems of That Crucified From Whom the fountain of salvation flows. But still more awful is that hush intense Which broods within us, while our hands receive The “Body and the Blood” Thy words dispense,— Lest in the act God's holy One we grieve! “Take, eat, and drink,” while thus our souls obey, Grant that our feeding hearts in faith may be Nourish'd by what those elements convey,— Which are the Tokens that adumbrate Thee. Well may we bow beneath some voiceless awe! For if all life be mystery to man, Who can unweave that sacramental law By heaven decreed Rev. xiii. 8. before all souls began? Seeds of eternity its depths enclose,— Germs of a glory, life will not unfold Till the last trumpet break the tomb's repose And risen saints shall God in flesh behold. Celestial Giver of the feast divine, Come with Thy Spirit's ever-wakeful charm, And while their Bodies are inspired by Thine Rom. viii. 11. Protect each member from polluting harm. E'en while we “eat and drink Thy Flesh and Blood” Seraphic radiance seems to clothe the soul, And vigour, born of eucharistic food, Brightens each grace and purifies the whole. Nearer and nearer to that Centre we Move onward—drawn by some magnetic spell Whose deep attractions prove the Trinity John xiv. 23. In thy dread myst'ry of Communion dwell. Pardon and peace, with purity and love, All are embalm'd in this divinest meal, While angels, bending from their thrones above, Echo the wonder mortal bosoms feel. And evermore, may touch, and taste, and sight In this heart-sacrifice to Jesu given, Be so instinct with God's mysterious rite That earth may train them for a sphere in heaven. Renew'd in body and revived in heart And inly-brightened with unuttered bliss,— Perennial Sacrament, how dear thou art To saints who worship in a world like this! As God and Man, by incarnation one, A unity in Christ's dread Person make, The Chruch Ephes. v. 30. incorp'rate with th' eternal Son Becomes a Body which can never break. A myst'ry this!—but that almighty Word On Whom the pillars of creation rest, By faith and not by sceptic reason heard,— His imaged Passion on this rite imprest With such deep truth, that saints adore Him there To gain that wisdom Spirits learn above, Who study Ephes. iii. 10. Godhead in the house of prayer, And live to worship, and are wise by love. Post Communion. “We offer and present unto Thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls, and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto Thee.” —Prayer Book. Not from their feast of awful love May Paschal guests in peace depart Till they have hymn'd with choirs above The Hallel of a grateful heart. Thus, Mother of the faithful, Thou A parting banquet hast supplied Of praise and prayer, for all who vow That they adore The God who died. As Members of Thyself, O Lord, Well may regen'rate souls begin To hear Thine own adopting word,— The “Abba!” that is breath'd within. A double sacrifice they bring Of person and of praise combined, Who render Thee such offering As He accepts, Who saves mankind. Author and Finisher divine Of hope, and faith, and all we are! Now present at Thy bloodless shrine, With pardon consecrate our prayer. All meritless, the craven soul Would shrink and shudder back with dread Except it heard Love's whisper roll,— “Emanuel for the guilty bled!” The precious “Body and the Blood” By ministerial hands imparted, With more than super-heavenly food Now calm and cheer the broken-hearted. As living members we cohere In Christ, by mystic life and love, And though the trembling person fear Our nature is secured above,— Assumed by that incarnate Head Whose will the universe sustains, And by his speaking Blood hath said His glory in forgiveness reigns. Life-giving Lord! where'er we roam May sacraments our pledges be,— Thy merits are that mystic home Where aching hearts unite with Thee. Gloria in Excelsis. “Glory be to God on high! on earth, peace!” —Prayer Book. Bright choristers around God's throne! We cannot catch the glory-tone, But when high raptures most intensely reign Can lauding wonder so attune your strain As that which thrills a saint on earth Rejoicing o'er his second-birth? Ye living stars of light above Who glisten with adoring love, Creation's Job xxxviii. 7. quire! heaven gave you once to see Fresh from the cradle of eternity An infant-world repose awhile Under Jehovah's mantling smile: But though as God's elect in glory 'Twas yours to chant creation's story, While passionless and pure such bright estate On earth eclipses all of good or great,— Yet far beyond what angels know, The Church's eucharistic glow In this high festival of Praise!— Here, pardon'd souls hosannahs raise; And while the deep'ning hallelujah rolls Melodious worship round the Lord of souls Saints feel what seraphs never can,— They live on Him who bled for Man! Hence, Gloria in excelsis! Lord, In echoes of Thy caroll'd word Lift we in lauding ecstacy above, Impassion'd now with superhuman love:— If angel-food Psalm lxxii. 25. to saints belong, They rightly chant the angel-song. We laud, we bless, we glorify Thy pure and perfect Majesty Dread King of Kings! almightily conceal'd E'en in that “Great is the mystery of Godliness. God was manifest in the flesh” (1 Tim. iii. 16.) light where Love is most reveal'd,— Supremest God, celestial One The Father of th' incarnate Son. Begotten of the true I AM, By sacrifice the saving Lamb, Eternal Semblance of th' eternal Sire! Thy mercies and Thy merits now inspire All hearts which feel devotion's flame Burn into brightness at Thy name. O Thou, Whose death-pangs took away The guilt that on creation lay, Glory to Thee! Whose feet our world have trod, But now art seated on the throne of God,— Thy suppliant Church would Thee adore Prophet and Priest for evermore. “Glory to God, good will to man”— Behold, the everlasting plan, With “peace on earth” and pardon brought from heaven, Justice atoned and forfeit-souls forgiven,— For this we laud and glorify Salvation through the Trinity! “Glory to God!” again, again Adoring myriads swell the strain; Not quiring angels who ensphere His throne Can reach or rival that exulting tone Of rescued sinners, who have cried For me a God was crucified! Collects after the Offertory. “Assist us mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplications.” Prayer Book. Exhaustless like a mother's heart With blessings for her child Thou for Thy praying children art,— In faith the undefiled; Stored in whose sacramental depths abound Gifts of subduing grace by worship found. Soon will those harsh unheavenly airs Which round the rude world play, Be heard, instead of temple-prayers True souls delight to say,— When back to perill'd life their spirits go And face the warfare christian warriors know. And lest unask'd some mercy be, Six parting Collects woo The Pastor's choice; where souls may see How all of deep and true Pure supplication can from God require, Breathes in that love our Church's lips inspire. In this vex'd world of change and chance Lord, none are safe but those Who live beneath Thy loving glance In pureness and repose; And in the ark of Thy salvation, find A blissful centre which becalms the mind. And grace prevenient now we ask For all begun or ended In burden'd life's mysterious task, With sin and sorrow blended: That flesh and spirit, heart and inmost soul May all become Thy consecrated whole. And let Thine own almighty word Be grafted on each heart That saints may practise what they heard And choose that “better part” Which when the universe dissolves away In calm eternity outlives decay. Fountain of grace! to Thee is known A viewless world within Of wants unbreath'd, we dare not own,— Of blindness dread or sin; But Thy compassions can interpret all Who in meek silence on Thy mercy call. Cheer'd by Thy presence, hence we plead His everlasting Name Who bow'd the heavens on earth to bleed, And died the death of shame That pardon'd guilt on God might dare to gaze And gladden angels with, “Behold, he prays!” Thus down the haunted aisles of prayer With musing step and slow As part we, for our paths of care, This creed Thy children know,— The chord which vibrates in each heart is love, And that which tunes it, is The Hand above! Final Blessing. “Then the Priest (or Bishop, if he be present) shall let them depart with this blessing.” —Rubric. Silence can more than speech declare Whose very soul is voiceless prayer, Too deep for words but not too dumb for Thee Sole Head of saved humanity! And breathes there not religion now, A worship and a secret vow Which more than lip-tones may to God express The heart's adoring inwardness? “Thou only art The Lord of Lords!” As die away those deep-toned words Melting and mingling with the unheard chant Of harping seraphs, jubilant,— In hush'd devotion souls forgiven Are waiting for that peace from heaven, Father in God! thy lips may now proclaim And gently breathe in Jesu's name. O Thou supernal Holy Ghost, Descend upon you kneeling host, And all The Priest of priesthood can impart Impress Thou on each saintly heart. Light Love and Knowledge,—all combine And circle round that mystic shrine Where Thou, Emanuel, art by faith adored As perfect Man and holy Lord. Blest privilege! which dazzles thought, With more than moral Eden fraught, If peace celestial on those hearts descend Which now before yon Altar bend Calm and up-closed,—like flowers at night When drinking in that dewy light The fascinating stars from heaven infuse To freshen their ethereal hues. But hark, in holy calm is heard Thy blessing, O incarnate Word! And as we listen, from the bowers above Glides down the aisles the heavenly Dove. Thus was it, Lord, in days of old:— Ere realms of radiance did enfold Thy soaring Form with shrouds of awful light Above the reach of mortal sight Thy parting words, divinely-full, Soothed the sad hour with solemn lull When bent adorers who beheld it rise, In heart soar'd with Thee through the skies. Baptism of Infants. ‘Doubt ye not, therefore, but earnestly believe, that he will likewise favourably receive this present Infant.” —(Prayer Book.) If Love celestial ne'er had said Let children to mine arms be led, Parents might shrink aghast A creature into life to bring Whose soul the curse of God may wring When time and earth are past!— But for the promise of baptismal grace What sight so fearful as an infant-face? All that a birth of flesh can give Is but the awful doom,—to live! A heritage of woe, A destiny of guilt and death, A curse inhaled at every breath Life breathes from sin below!— By grace unfoiled, destruction seems to lower On the sad babe ere time can count an hour. But at the font where Jesu stands With greeting heart and gracious hands Ready to clasp the child,— Pale infant! there, a breath from heaven Shall to thy dawning soul be given Through Him the Saviour mild, Who while He thunders from His regal throne Loves the sweet age on earth He call'd His Own. The Root of sacramental grace Is the new Adam of our race,— The Man Divine who bled; Hence cometh an immortal birth Beyond the parentage of earth From our generic Head, The Lord from heaven Whose vital spirit gives The law by which the mystic Body Col. i. 18. lives. More than our first-born parents knew Before they proved to God untrue Works a celestial gift; Angels who on their trial stood Exceed not this majestic good Which may thy soul uplift:— A child of God!—can seraphim aspire To aught sublimer in their sinless choir? From thee the curse is roll'd away; Thy soul's new birth begins to-day By cov'nant-right to all Immunities and blessings high The heart of Jesus can supply To those who heed His call:— Now to the stillness of thy soul is given, Like breezeless water to reflect a heaven. A city and a crown are thine If thou be true to grace divine, Bearing thy destined cross;— Lo, on thy forehead lies the seal Where symbol both and sign reveal That life must gain by loss: Matt. x. 39. Firm to thy vow, beneath God's banner fight And keep thy panoply of graces bright. Christ guard thee now, thou little one! His glory be thy shield and sun Whate'er thy lot may be; Incorp'rate with the Church thou art And hence to thee will Heaven impart The truth which maketh free,— New prospects ope, new principles and powers Rise into play and rule thine unborn hours. And if in secret darkness lie Those sacred germs which none descry Dormant and cold within, May God's reviving Breath awake Till such dark bond of slumber break And grace o'ermaster sin.— That latent seed baptismal life bestows Doth oft in elder hearts its buried power disclose. How water word and grace combine Their action with a work divine In vain let reason ask:— Children are awful mysteries Within whose depth no spirit sees But His,—who owns the task Of overcoming through celestial birth That born corruption which is bred from earth. Hence! reas'ning sceptic, harsh and cold; For never will thine eyes behold Tokens which sense defy: Nature in secret works her plan, Her growth escapes the sight of man, Then hush thy heartless cry:— As if the weakness of the water could Deprive the soul of sacramental good! Hereafter as a priest and king, Thy babe becomes a holy Thing, An heir of grace and glory; Mother! to whom such charge is given, Now rear it for that throne in heaven Scripture unveils before thee: So discipline the dawning mind and will That each some priesthood unto God may fill. “Our Father!” now thy babe may cry Whose elder Brother rules the sky,— The Man Divine who came By bleeding merit to atone For all the guilt sad earth must own, And give the child a name New as that sacramental birth which then Through water and The Spirit dawns in men. Blest privilege! both deep and pure Which might our trembling hearts assure That we are Christ's indeed: Our robe baptismal,—keep it white And never wilt thou lose the right Which marks the heavenly seed Of all who, grafted into Christ by grace, Born in the Church, are God's adopted race. Oh that on man's expressive brow Baptismal pureness beaming now Maturer life might see!— How should we bless that rite of heaven Where grace is felt and sin forgiven By mercy full as free,— And find God's Spirit ne'er that man forsook Who kept in age the vow his childhood took. Marriage. “An honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church.” —Form of Solemnization of Matrimony. Around the cradle of this new-born earth Though harping seraphs came to sing Whose choral ecstasies proclaim'd its worth And caused heaven's crystal arch to ring, All was unmeaning, till creation saw A human “Have dominion” (Gen. i. 26.) monarch, and obey'd his law. Vain seem'd the splendour, which no eye could see, The melody, that none could hear; But when God utter'd “Let Mine Image be,” Creation thrill'd as Man drew near! And what was meaningless and mute and dead Warm'd into life, and glow'd beneath his tread. As man for earth, so woman was required The crowning grace of man to form; Alone, not even Adam was inspired To feel creation's godlike charm:— And thus, faith hears this fiat from The Throne, “It is not good for man to be alone.” So ere the fall, a Priest almighty brought His bridal Eve to Adam's heart,— A living echo for the love he sought, A help-meet never to depart, A true companion for the soul to be, Fresh from her God in faultless purity. Marriage is holy. May no heathen-fire Around the christian altar flame; Impassion'd souls let saintliness inspire And hallow hymeneal claim: Belials in sense are minds by flesh o'erruled, And love is vice, unless by virtue school'd. How hush'd and holy is yon bridal-scene In yon pure temple!—view'd by one Who e'er by faith in Cana's home hath been, That marriage-group to gaze upon Where the pale water blush'd itself to wine Moved by a miracle of grace divine Stainless in vesture as the lily white, With flower-buds in her wreathèd hair, Fearful and trepid, awed with new delight Lo! the young bride is kneeling there, Her dropping lids in mild dejection bent And young heart with a holy conflict rent. In that pure breast what garner'd feelings play Like pulses with mysterious beat! To think, sweet girlhood now hath wing'd away And love must quit a calm retreat,— Sacred to thought through friends and forms no more, And truths, which made the reeling heart run o'er! It is not, that a voiceless dread awakes Suspicion, lest her choice be wrong; No blighting vision o'er the future breaks To which both guilt and grave belong: Yet sadness haunts around her like a spell,— As oft in marriage-chime there seems a knell. Our life is myst'ry; and the brightest joy That flushes round a feeling heart Seems coldly shaded by some dim alloy Doom'd never from man's world to part:— True mirth with mournfulness is oft allied As living babes suggest the babe who died. And she, yon bridal star of beauty now Oh marvel not, as there she kneels, That ere the wife can dawn upon her brow Back to bright girlhood fancy steals; Dead joys revive in tombs to fancy dear, Melt through the heart and mingle with a tear! Last eve, at halycon twilight's dreamful hour When none but God the soul could see She pray'd and ponder'd in her girlish bower, And sigh'd, dead Past! her thoughts o'er thee;— Flower, fruit, and pathways, all instinct with truth, Seem'd to accost her like the tones of Youth. She mused on what her spousal life might fold Within its undevelop'd scene; On wings of love recall'd the times of old And wept o'er all bright hearts had been; And scarce perceived the pensive moonlight throw Its calm cold lustre on the lake below. But maiden! ere thy sacred ring be worn, Beyond a mother's purest gift The Church hath up to heaven's high portals borne A prayer,—which shall thy soul uplift To heights of bliss serene as brides attain Whose wedded hearts are thrones where Christ will reign. Souls are espoused by ev'ry hallow'd claim, If wedlock far diviner prove Than flesh-born ties, which boast the common name Of what sense means by mortal “love:”— Christ and the Church Ephes. v. 31, 32. are shadow'd out by this And cast heaven's radiance round an earthly bliss. Churching of Women. “We give thee humble thanks, for that thou hast vouchsafed to deliver this woman thy servant, from the great pain and peril of childbirth.” —English Prayer Book. In love maternal hides a spell A mother's heart alone can see, Transcending all that tears may tell Or man can be. Far down within the spirit's deep Her fountains of affection lie Like currents which in darkness sweep Nor face the sky. Tender abyss of peerless love! To heaven's omniscient eye-glance known, The Woman-born Who reigns above Thy claims doth own. A pillow'd Babe on mother's breast Beneath Him throbb'd the Virgin-heart,— And, Woman! thou on Him canst rest Whoe'er thou art. Oh magic force of nature!—felt Far as the sun and sea extend; Beneath whose law all beings melt And spirits bend. The Indian-mother, stern and strong, Cradles her infant on the tree And wildly chants her loud wood-song For lullaby. And the stern negress, seeking food, Fastens the babe upon her back, To roam each rocky solitude Or lion's track. Nor scene nor change, nor earth nor sky Enfeeble love's maternal force; Distance and time before it die Whate'er their course. A passion this, so pure and deep, That while bereavèd fathers moan Enduring mothers only weep In heart alone! But, why did God such love create Ineffably profound and pure?— Because from mothers spirits date Their curse, or cure. Thus martyrs, saints and heroes,—all Whom wond'ring time delights to praise, In heaven itself may still recall Those infant-days When learn'd they from maternal lips Lessons of holy love and prayer,— No clouds hereafter could eclipse With sad despair. Then, pallid mother! draw thee nigh, Perill'd by pangs but saved in birth; And dovelike lift thy downcast eye To heaven from earth. The virgin-whiteness of that veil Becomes thine inward purity, And hides upon thy forehead pale What angels see Of blissful worship,—deep and mild Which mothers for their first-born pay, And love with conscience undefiled Offers to-day. Thou art the parent of a soul, The mother of a deathless mind! And Christ to thee imparts control For this design'd. Self-discipline with prayer-born love And persevering wisdom calm Send, Holy Spirit, from above, And soothing balm; That from Thine Altar she may part In saintly mood serene and high, And worship Christ with yearning heart Until she die. Mothers are more than mines of wealth If God-devoted souls they be; And what makes empire's moral health And purity They guard. For, how do nations sink Into dark graves of sin and woe?— When Church and State no longer think What debt they owe To christian mothers! unto whom Both God and nature have consign'd Existence, from whose dawning bloom They nurse mankind. Prayers at Sea. “Glorious Lord God! at whose commands the winds blow and lift up the waves of the sea, and who stillest the rage thereof.” —English Prayer Book. Mother, whose heart keeps watch with wakeful care Hark how the storm-blasts through the welkin roll! Thunder alarms the breast of guilty fear And the red lightnings dart from pole to pole. Louder and louder sweeps the gale! Fierce in descent the hurried rain-drops fall, And midnight Terror, with emotion pale, Begins in secret on her God to call. Calm as a flower yon nursling lies Rock'd into silence on the cradling breast; Yet doth thy bosom heave with unheard sighs Which rouse the spirit into sad unrest. Yet not for thy domestic bower Or those who sleep within its guardian-shade, Art thou awake at this convulsive hour To hear the crash wild elements have made. But in thy heart is heard the raging deep Toss'd in huge billows with tumultuous swell, And voiceless tremors through thy bosom creep For thy lone sea-boy,—loved at home so well! Last year upon thy breast he lay His head in fondness, parting for the sea, And would not brush the manly tear away Which flow'd from nature, and which fell on thee. And now amid the shroud and sail Perchance he grapples with the bending mast, And when soft images of home prevail Around him feels thine arms maternal cast! Mother, thy Church confronts the waves, Her litanies can lull their angry roar, And He who watcheth o'er the ocean-graves Can make the sea as tranquil as the shore. Christ on the waters forms a home For all who trust Him in the tempest wild, Far as the pilgrims of the deep can roam Or billows lullaby a sea-born child. Safe is thy darling in this hour, Dearer to heaven than mother's heart can know; Calmly entrust him to that sleepless Power, Deepen thy prayers,—but let not doubts o'erflow. Mirthful and bright thy sea-boy ran Around thee once, through garden grove and field; But now, emerging into ripen'd man, Conscience and creed divinest influence wield. Precious, yon Bible!—'twas thy boon; And, mother, where thy parting tear-gush fell Oft on the deck beneath the sacred moon He reads the warnings thou has scored so well. And that high book of hallow'd Prayer A treasured sister gave, with farewell kiss, Oft will he welcome what its truths declare And hail the sabbath as a holy bliss. God of the winds and waves and seas! Whom all the vassal elements obey, Whether by palmy shores the placid breeze Soft as a seraph-wing descends to play, Or tempests heave the mountain-surge Flashing with foam beneath some lurid glare, While the drench'd mariners the vessel urge,— We thank Thy wisdom for the ocean prayer. Or when the booming death-guns pour Peal after peal, redoubling as they roll, Or Vict'ry shouts her patriotic roar Of loud huzzahs from seaman's gallant soul Lord of the Deep! by Thee inspired Our Church for each some high-breath'd prayer imparts, That they whom Valour hath for conquest fired The Prince of Peace should have to hush their hearts. Seldom can inland-worship prove Toned with such tenderness sublime and deep— Like God's own halcyon calming from above The wailing hearts that o'er some lost one weep,— As when beneath the trancèd air While moonbeams like a shroud enrobe the wave, Mild fall the tones of that funereal prayer Which parts the billow for a seaman's grave. Tearful the watching comrades stand Hush'd into silence by a holy spell, And hide those grief-drops with a rough-worn hand Whose tender fountain is the word,—“farewell.” Peace to the dead! he waits his hour When the last trumpet shall untomb yon sea And with such life-blast all her waves o'erpower Dust shall arise, and look in Deity!</field>
