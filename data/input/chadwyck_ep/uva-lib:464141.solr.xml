      <field name="fulltext">Hic incipit uita Ricardi regis primi. Lord Iesu, kyng off glorye, Whyche grace and uyctorye Þou sente to Kyng Rychard, Þat neuer was founde coward! It is ful good to here in ieste Off his prowesse and hys conqueste. Ffele romaunses men maken newe, Off goode kny?tes, stronge and trewe; Off here dedys men rede romaunce, Boþe in Engeland and in Ffraunce: Off Rowelond, and off Olyuer, And off euery Doseper; Off Alisaundre, and Charlemayn; Off kyng Arthour, and off Gawayn, How þey were knyghtes goode and curteys; Off Turpyn, and of Oger Daneys; Off Troye men rede in ryme, What werre þer was in olde tyme; Off Ector, and off Achylles, What folk þey slowe in þat pres. In Frenssche bookys þis rym is wrou?t, Lewede men ne knowe it nou?t— Lewede men cune Ffrensch non, Among an hondryd vnneþis on—; Neuerþeles, wiþ glad chere, Ffele off hem þat wolde here Noble iestes, j vndyrstonde, Off dou?ty kny?tes off Yngelonde. Þerfore now j wole ?ow rede Off a kyng, dou?ty in dede: Kyng Rychard, þe werryour beste Þat men fynde in ony ieste. Now alle þat here þis talkyng, God geue hem alle good endyng! Lordynges, herkenes bifore, How Kyng Rychard was gete and bore. Hys fadyr hy?te Kyng Henry; In hys tyme, sykyrly, Als j finde in my sawe, Seynt Thomas was islawe At Cauntyrbury at þe awterston, Þere manye myraclys are idon. When he was twenty wyntyr olde, He was a kyng swyþe bolde; He wolde no wyff, j vndyrstonde, Wiþ gret tresore þou? he here fonde. Nevyrþeles hys barouns hym redde Þat he grauntyd a wyff to wedde. Hastely he sente hys sondes Into manye dyuerse londes, Þe ffeyreste wymman þat wore on liff Men scholde brynge hym to wyff. Messangeres were redy dy?t, To schippe þey wente þat ylke ny?t. Anon þe sayl vp þay drow?, Þe wynd hem seruyd wel jnow?. Whenne þey come on mydde þe see, No wynd oneþe hadden hee; Þerfore hem was swyþe woo. Anoþer schip þey countryd þoo, Swylk on ne sey? þey neuere non. Al it was whyt off ruel-bon, And euery nayl wiþ gold begraue; Off pure gold was þe staue, Here mast was of yuory, Off samyte þe sayl wytterly, Here ropes were off tuely sylk, Also whyte as ony mylk. Þat noble schyp was al wiþoute Wiþ cloþis off gold spred aboute; And here looff and here wyndas Off asure forsoþe it was. In þat schyp þer were jdy?t Kny?tes and ladyys off mekyll my?t; And a lady þerinne was, Bry?t as þe sunne þorw? þe glas. Here men a borde gunne to stande, And sesyd þat oþer to here hande, And prayde hem for to dwelle, And here counsayl for to telle; And þey graunted wiþ alle skylle Ffor to telle al at here wylle. “Swoo wyde landes we haue went, Ffor Kyng Henry vs has sent Ffor to seke hym a qwene, Þe fayreste þat my?te fonnde bene.” Vp ros a kyng off a chayere, Wiþ þat word þey spoke þere— Þe chayer was charbocle ston, Swylk on ne saw? þey neuere non—, And two dukes hym besyde, Noble men and off mekyl pryde, And welcomed þe messangere ylkone; Into þat schyp þey gunne gone— Þrytty kny?tes, wiþouten lye, Fforsoþe was in þat cumpanye. Into þat ryche schyp þey went, As messangeres þat weren jsent. Kny?tes and ladyes come hem a?ene; Seuene score, and moo j wene, Welcomyd hem alle at on wurd. Þey sette tresteles, and layde a bord— Cloþ off sylk þeron was sprad—, And þe kyng hymseluen bad Þat hys dou?tyr were forþ fette, And in a chayer before hym sette. Trumpes begonne for to blowe, Sche was fet forþ in a þrowe Wiþ twenty kny?tes here aboute, And moo off ladyes þat were stoute; Alle þey gunne knele here too, And aske here what she wolde han doo. Þey eeten and drank and maden ham glade, As þe kyng hymselff hem bade. Whenne þey hadde ny? jeete, Auentures to speke þey nou?t forgete. Þe kyng hem tolde, in hys resoun, It com hym in a vysyoun— In hys land þat he cam froo— Into Yngelond for to goo; And hys dou?tyr, þat was hym dere, Ffor to wende with hym in ffere. “In þis manere we haue vs dy?t, Into þat lond to wende ry?t.” Þenne answeryd a messanger, Hys name was callyd Bernager, “Fforþere wole we seke nou?t, To my lord sche schal be brou?t: When he wiþ eyen schal sen, Ffol wel payed þen wole he ben.” Þe wynd aros out off þe norþeste, And seruede hem ri?t wiþ þe beste. At þe Tour þey gunne arryue, To londe þe kny?tes wente belyue. Þe messangeres þe kyng haue told Of þat lady fayr and bold, Þer he lay, in þe Tour, Off þat lady whyt so flour. Kyng Henry gan hym sone dy?t, Wiþ erl, baroun, and manye a kny?t, Agayn þe lady for to wende, Ffor he was curteys and hende. Þe damysele on londe was led, And cloþis off gold before here spred, And here fadyr here beforn, Wiþ a coroun off gold jcorn; Þe messangers by ylke a syde, And menstralles wiþ mekyl pryde. Kyng Henry ly?te in hyyng, And grette fayre þat vncouþ kyng, And þat fayre lady alsoo: “Welcome be ?e alle me too.’ To Westemenstre they wente in fere, Lordynges and ladyys þat þer were. Trumpes begonne for to blowe, To mete þey wente in a þrowe. Kny?tes seruyd þere good spede, Off what to telle it is no nede. And afftyr mete, in hyyng, Spak Kyng Henry, oure kyng, To þe kyng þat sat in same, “Leve sere, what is þy name?” “My name, he sayde, is Corbaryng; Off Antyoche j am kyng.” And tolde hym in hys resoun, He cam þedyr þorw? a vysyoun. “Fforsoþe, Sere, j telle þe, I hadde elles brou?t more meyne, Manye moo, wiþouten fayle, And moo schyppys wiþ vytayle.” Þenne askyd he þat lady bry?t: “What hy?test þou, my swete wy?t?” “Cassodorien, wiþouten lesyng,” Þus answeryd sche þe kyng. “Damysele, he seyde, bry?t and schene, Wylt þou dwelle, and be my qwene?” Sche answeryd wiþ wordys stylle, “Sere, j am at my faderys wylle.” Here fadyr grauntyd þenne ful sone, Al hys wyl scholde be done, Hastely þat she were wedde As qwene vnto kynges bedde; And prayde hym, for hys curtesy, It moste be done priuyly. Þe spousyng was jdon þat ny?t; Þeratte daunsyd many a kny?t: Mekyl ioye was hem among. A preest on morwe þe messe song; Befforn þe eleuacyoun Þe qwene fel in swowne adoun; Þe folk wondryd and were adrad; Into a chaumbyr sche was lad, Sche seyde: “For j am þus jschent, I dar neuere see þe sacrement.” Here fadyr on morwe took hys leue, No lengere wolde he þere beleue. The kyng dwellyd wiþ his qwene; Chyldren þey hadden hem bytwene, Twoo knaues and a mayde, Fforsoþe, as þe book vs sayde. Rychard hy?te þe fyrste, jwis, Off whom þis romaunce jmaked is; Jhon þat oþer forsoþe was; Þe þrydde hys sustyr Topyas. Þus þey dwellyd in fere To þe ffyfftenþe ?ere. On a day, before þe rode Þe kyng at hys masse stode; Þer com an erl off gret pouste, “Sere, he sayde, hou may þis be, Þat my lady, ?oure wyff, þe qwene, Þe sacrement ne dar nou?t sene? Geue vs leue to don here dwelle, Ffro þat begynnes þe gospelle Tyll þe messe be sungge and sayd, And þou schalt se a queynte brayd.” Þe kyng grauntyd, wiþ good wylle, To holden here wiþ strengþe stylle. “Neyþer for wele neyþer for woo, Let here nou?t out fro kyrke goo.” And whene þe belle began to ryng, The preest scholde make þe sakeryng, Out off þe kyrke sche wolde away. Þe erl “For gode, sayde, nay, Lady, þou schalt here abyde, Ffor ony þyng þat may betyde.” Sche took here dou?tyr in here hond, And Johan her sone she wolde not wonde; Out of the rofe she gan her dyght, Openly before all theyr syght. Johan fell frome her in that stounde, And brak his thygh on the grounde. And with her doughter she fled her waye, That never after she was isey. The kynge wondred of that thynge, That she made suche an endynge, For loue that he was serued so; Wolde he neuer after come there ne go. He let ordeyne, after his endynge, His sone Rycharde to be kynge. Crowned after Kynge Harry Thus was Rycharde, sykerly, That was in his XV yere. He was a man of grete powere: Dedes of armes he gaue hym to, As falleth for kynges and knyghtes to do. He woxyd so stronge and so wyght, Ayenst hym had no man no myght. In euery stede he toke honoure, As a noble kynge and conqueroure. The fyrste yere that he was kynge At Salysbury he made a justynge, And comaunded euery man to be there, Bothe with shelde and with spere, Erles and barons euerychone; At home ne dwelled neuer one. On forfeyture, on lyfe and londe, For nothynge that they ne wonde: This was cryed, j vnderstonde, Thorughout all Englonde. All was for to loke, and se The knyghtes that best myght be. There they came all at his wyll His comaundemente to fulfyll. The partyes were sonder set, Togyder they ran without let. Kynge Rycharde gan hym dysguyse In a full stronge queyntyse. He came out of a valaye For to se of theyr playe, As a knyght auentorous. His atyre was orgulous: All togyder coleblacke Was his horse, without lacke; Upon his creste a rauen stode, That yaned as he were wode, And aboute his necke a bell, Wherfore the reason j shall you tell: The kynde of the rauen is, In trauayll for to be, jwys; Sygnyfyaunce of the bell, With holy chyrche for to dwell, And them to noy and to greue That be not in the ryght byleue. He bare a shafte that was grete and stronge, It was fourtene fote long; And it was bothe grete and stoute, One and twenty inches aboute. The fyrst knyght that he there mette, Full egerly he hym grette With a dente amyd the shelde; His horse he bare downe in the felde: And the knyght fell to grounde, Full nye deed in that stounde. The nexte that he mette thare, A grete stroke he hym bare; His gorgere, with his coronalle tho, His necke he brake there a two: His horse and he fell to grounde, And dyed bothe in that stounde. Kyng Rycharde gan houe and abyde, Yf ony mo wold to hym ryde. Trumpettes began forto blowe, Knyghtes justed in that throwe. Another knyght, hardy and good, Sate on a stede rede as blode; He dyde hym arme and well dyght, In all that longed to suche a knyght. A shafte he toke grete and longe, That was heuy and stronge, And sayd, he wolde to hym ryde, Yf he durste hym abyde. Trumpettes began to blowe than, Therby wyste many a man That they sholde juste more, The noble knyghtes that there wore. Kyng Rycharde of hym was ware, And a spere to hym he bare, And encountred hym in the felde. He bare awaye halfe his shelde, His pusen therwith gan gone, And also his brandellet-bone, Hys vyser, and hys gorgere. Hym repented that he cam there! Kynge Rycharde houed, and behelde, And thought to rest hym in the felde, If there were other knyght or swayne That wolde more ryde hym agayne. He sawe there wolde come none; On his waye he gan forth gone, Into a wode, out of theyr syght; And in another tyre he hym dyght. Upon a stede rede as blode, With all the tyre that on hym stode, Horse and shelde, armure and man, That no man sholde knowe hym than; Upon his creste a rede hounde, The tayle henge to the grounde. That was sygnyfycacyoun The hethen folke to brynge downe, Them to slee for Goddes loue, And Crysten men to brynge aboue. Styll he houed and bode þore; To them he thought to ryde more. He rode the thronge all aboute, He helde within and withoute. A baron he sawe hym besyde, Towarde hym he gan ryde. To a squyer he toke his spere, To hym he wolde it not bere. Forth he toke a mansell; A stroke he thought to be set well On his helme that was so stronge: Of that dente the fyre outspronge. The baron tourned hym asyde, And sayd: “Felowe, forth thou ryde, With thy peres go and playe! Come no more here, j the praye! And sykerly, yf thou do, Thou shalte haue a knocke or two.” Kynge Rycharde wondred in his thought, That he set his stroke at nought, And came agayne by another waye, And thought to make a better paye. In his styrope up he stode, And smote to hym with jrefull mode. He set his stroke on his yron hat, But that other in his sadell sat. Hastely, without wordes mo, Hys mase he toke in his honde tho, That was made of yotyn bras; He wondred who that it was. Suche a stroke he hym lente, That Rycharde feet out of his steropes wente: For plate, ne for acketton, For hawberke, ne for campeson, Suche a stroke he neuer had none ore, That dyde hym halfe so moche sore. Ful swythe awaye he gan ryde, Out of the prees there besyde. To hymselfe he sayd tho: “Of suche strokes kepe j no mo!” He wente adowne to a well, And with his helme dranke his fell; And he watred his stede also. In the thyrde atyre he let hym do, All his atyre whyte as mylke; His croper was of sylke; Upon his shulder a crosse rede, That betokeneth Goddes dede With his ennemyes for to fyght, To wynne the crosse yf that he myght. Upon his heed a doue whyte— Sygnyfycacyoun of the holy spyryte— To be bolde to wynne the pryse, And dystroye Goddes enemyes. To the Kynge Rycharde gan hym dyght Than another noble knyght: Fouke Doly was his name, The kynge hym loued for his fame. To hym a stroke he dyght, Well to paye with all his myght. He smote hym on his bassenet A grete dente without let, It foundred to his cheke-bone. Syr Fouke bad hym forth gone, That he no lenger abyde, In auenture yf ony stroke betyde. The kynge sawe he felte no sore, And he thought to gyue hym more; And another stroke he hym brayde, Hys mase vpon his heed he layde, With good wyll that stroke he set. The baron thought he wolde hym let, And with his heuy mase of stele There he gaue the kynge his dele That his helme all toroue, And he ouer his sadell droue, And his steropes he forbare: Suche a stroke had he neuer are. He was so astonyed of that dente That nye he had his lyfe lente; And for that stroke that hym was gyuen He ne wyst whether it was daye or euen. Tho he recouered of his swowe To his palays he hym drowe. Than he commaunded hastely Herodes for to make a crye, And euery man for to wende Home to his owne frende. The kynge anone a messengere Full preuely he sente there To Syr Thomas of Multon, That was a noble baron, And to Syr Fouke Doly That they come to hym on hye, And þat þay dwell in no manere, Vntill þat þay be bothe here. The messangere his way is went, And sayd the kynge after them sente Swythe for to come hym to, Without delaye that it be do. The knyghtes hyed and were blythe, To the kynge they wente swythe, And hendly they hym grette; And he them toke and by hym sette, And sayd to them with wordes free: “Welcome be ye now to me!” In eyþyr hond he took on, Into a chaumbyr he bad hym gon. Quod Rychard: “Leue frendes twey, Tel me þe soþe, j ?ow prey, Off þese ioustes, paramours, What knyght was he þat rod best cours, And whiche coude best his crafte For to demene well his shafte, With dentes for to fell his foos? Whiche of them wan the loos, And who þe styffeste tymbyr brak?” Quod Multoun: “On in atyr blak Com preckande ouyr þe falewe feld; Alle þat þere was hym beheeld Hou he rod as he were wood; A roume he houyd, and wiþstood. On hys crest sat a rauen swart, And he ne heeld wiþ neyþer part. A schafft he bar, styff and strong, Ffourtene ffoote it was long, On and tweynty ynches aboute. He askyd at al þe route, ?yff ony durste come and proue A cours, ffor hys lemannes loue, Wiþ a kny?t aunterous. Now here A ?onge kny?t, a strong bachelere, He hente a schafft and stede bystrod, And to þe kny?t aunterous he rod. The aunterous wiþ hym mette, Swylke a strok on his scheld he sette Þat hors and man ouerþrewe. But þer was no man þat hym knewe. Trumpys blewe, herowdes gred, And alle oþer off hym dred, To jouste wiþ hym efft wiþ launse: En auntyr hym tydde swylk a chaunse. An hardy kny?t, stout and sauage, Hente a schafft wiþ gret rage. ‘Now he has on off oure felde! Wurþe we neuer for men telde, Siþ he haþ don vs þis despyte, ?iff he agayn passe quyte, Þat he ne haue ffyrste a knok!’ He prykyd forþ out off þe fflok, Wiþ a long schafft, stout and quarrey. In myd þe cours þenne mette þey; The auenturous smote his shelde amydde, A wonders case our knyght betydde. The aunterous felde hym þere wiþ yre Doun off his stede, and brak hys swyre. Þe þrydde kny?t to speke bygan: ‘Þis is a deuyl, and no man, Þat oure folk felles and sleth! Tyde me lyff, or tyde me deth, I shal mete hym ?yff j may!’ The aunterous, wiþ gret deray, So harde to oure kny?t he droff, Hys schelde in twoo peses roff; Hys schuldre wiþ hys schafft he brak, And bar hym ouer hys hors-bak, Þat he ffel doun, and brak hys arme: He ne dede hym no more harme. The aunterous þo turnyd agayn, And houyd stylle for to seyn Who durste iouste wiþ hym more. Off hym þey were adred ful sore Þat non durste jouste wiþ hym efft: Lest he hadde hem here lyf berefft; And whenne he sey? þer com no moo, He rod agayn þer he com ffroo. Afftyr þe blak anoþer come, Alle þe folk good kep nome. Hys hors, and hys atyr was red, He semed weel to be a qued; A red hound on hys helme aboue. He comme to seke and to proue, ?yff ony jouste wiþ hym dar. Whene non wolde he was war Wiþ schafft to him make chalenge, He rod doun ry?t be þe renge. Þe deuyl hym honge where he be! I not what deuyl hym eylid at me! Hys schafft a squyer he betook, And behelde me wiþ grymly look, And smot me soo wiþ hys mase, Ne hadde be Ihesu Crystys grace, My swyre hadde gon in twey. I bad hym ryde forþ hys wey, And dele wiþ ffooles as hymselff was. Agayn he com be anoþir pas, And gaff me a wel wers þan þat, But stylle in my sadyl j sat. Þo seyde many a modyr sone: ‘Allas, Sere Thomas off Multone, Þat he is smete wiþ vnskyl!’ My mase j hente wiþ good wyl, I smot hym þat alle folk it sey?, Doun off hys hors almost he fley?. Whenne j hym hadde a strok jset, And wolde haue blyssyd hym bet, No moo strokes wolde he abyde: Awey swyþe þenne gan he ryde.” Whene Multoun hadde hys tale told, Ffouk Doyly, a baroun bold, Seyde to þe Kyng Rychard: “Þe þrydde þer come afftyrward, In atyr whyt as snow?, Þer byheeld hym hey?e and low?. In hys scheeld a croys red as blood, A whyte doue on hys helme stood. He houyd, and byheeld vs ?erne, ?yff þer was ony kny?t so sterne, So hardy man, and strong off bones Þat durste iouste wiþ him ones. Þer was non so stoute ne gryme, Þat durste iouste þoo wiþ hym. Doun by þe renge he ?ede doun faste, To me he com ry?t at þe laste. For sothe, Sere kyng, quod Sere Fouke, I wene þat kny?t was a pouke. Wiþ hys mase on my basynet Wiþ hys ry?te hand a dynt he set, Wiþ wraþþe strong, and egre mayn, Þat ny? al stonyd was my brayn. I spak to hym at wurdes fewe: ‘Ryde now forþ, þou wode-schrewe, And pleye wiþ hem þat is þy pere! ?yff þou come efft in þis manere Ffor to be wys j schal þe teche.’ Efft he gan more cunteke seche. A werre strok he gaff me ?ette, And wiþ my mase j hym grette That boþe hys styropes he forles; And stonyd he rod out off þe pres, And agayn vndir wode-bou?.” Kyng Rychard sat fol stylle and lou? And sayde: “Frendys sykyrly, Takes nou?t to greeff, for it was j. Whenne ?e were gaderyd alle in fere, Aunterous j com, in þis manere, Who so was strengest ?ow to asaye, And who cowde best strokes paye. Lordynges, he sayde, wete ?e nou?t, What j have ordeynyd in my þou?t? Þe Holy Lond to wende too, We three, wiþouten kny?tes moo; All in palmeres gyse, Þe Holy Lond for to devyse. To me j wole þat ?e be swore, No man to wete þat now is bore, Neyþer for wele ne for woo, Tyl þat we be comen and goo.” Þey grauntyd hym hys askyng Wiþouten any agaynsayyng, Wiþ hym to lyue and to dye, And lette nou?t for loue ne eye. On þe book þey layde here hand, To þat forewarde for to stand, And kyste hem þenne alle þree, Trewe sworn for to bee. Trumpes blewe, and made cry, To mete wente þey hastyly, And on the twentyþe day at ende Þey were redy for to wende Wiþ pyke, scrippe, and wiþ sclauin, As palmers weren in paynym. Now þey dy?ten hem ful ?are, Þese þree kny?tes for to fare. Þey sette vp sayl, þe wynd was good, And saylyd ouer þe salte-flood Into Fflaundrys, j ?ow saye. Rychard and hys feres twaye, Fforþ þey wente, wiþ glad chere, Þorw? manye londes, fer and nere, Tyl þey come to Braundys, Þat is a coost off mekyl prys. A noble schyp þey founde þare Into Cyprys redy to fare. Þe seyl was reysyd, þe schip was strong, And in þe see þey were long; And at þe laste, j undyrstande, At Ffamagos þey come to lande. Þere þey dwellyd fourty dawes, Ffor to lerne þe landes lawes; And seþen deden hem on þe see Toward Acres, þat riche cete; And so forþ to Massedoyne, And to þe cyte off Babyloyne, And fro þennes to Cesare; Off Nynyve þey were ware, And þe cyte off Ierusalem; And to þe cyte off Bedlem, And to þe cyte of Sudan Turry, And eke alsoo to Ebedy, And to þe Castel Orglyous, And to þe cyte of Aperyous, To Jaffe, and to Safrane, To Taboret, and to Archane. Thus þey vysytyd þe Holy Land, How þey my?t wynne it to here hand; And seþþen homward þey hem dy?t, To Yngelond wiþ al here my?t, Whenne þey hadde passyd þe Grykys se, In Alemayne, þe palmeres þre Letten, or þey my?ten goo. Þat turnyd hem to mekyl woo! I schal ?ow telle þat be here, Herkenes alle in what manere! A goos þey dy?te to here dynere, In a tauerne in þere þey were. Kyng Rychard þe ffyr bet, And Thomas to þe spyte hym set, Ffouk Doyly tempryd þe woos: Dere abou?te þey þat goos! Whenne þey hadde drunken wel, afyn, A mynstralle com þer in, And saide: “Goode men, wyttyrly, Wole ?e haue ony mynstralsy?” Rychard bad þat he scholde goo; Þat turnyd hym to mekyl woo. Þe mynstralle took in mynde, And sayde: “?e are men vnkynde, And ?iff j may, ?e schall forþynk. ?e gaff me neyþer mete ne drynk! Ffor gentyl men scholde bede To mynstrall þat abouten ?ede Off here mete, wyn, and ale: Ffor los ryses off mynstrale.” He was Ynglysch, and wel hem knew, Be speche, and sy?te, hyde, and hewe. Forthe he wente in that tyde To a castell there besyde, And tolde the kynge all and some, That thre men were to the cyte come; Stronge men, bolde and fere, In the worlde is not theyr pere. Kynge Rycharde of Englonde was the one man, Fouke Doly was that other than, The thyrde Thomas of Multon, Noble knyghtes of renowne. In palmers wede they be dyght, That no man sholde knowe them ryght. To hym sayd the kynge: “Iwys, That thou haste tolde yf it sothe is, Thou shalte haue thy warysowne, And chose thyselfe a ryche towne.” The kynge commaunded his knyghtes, To arme them in all myghtes: “And go and take them all thre, And swithe brynge them to me!” Forth wente the knyghtes in fere, And toke the palmers at theyr dynere. They were brought before the kynge, And he asked them in hyenge: “Palmers”, he sayd, “whens be ye?” “Of Englonde”, they sayd, “we be.” “What hyght thou falowe?” sayd the kynge. “Rycharde”, he sayd, “without lesynge.” “What hyght thou”, he sayd to the elder man. “Fouke Doly”, he answered than. “And what thou”, he sayd, “gray-here?” “Thomas of Multon”, he sayd there. The kynge asked them all thre What they dyde in his countre. “I saye you without lyes, Ye seme well to be spyes! Ye haue sene my londe vp and downe, I trowe, ye thynke me some treasowne, For as moche as thou, Syr Kynge, And thy barons, without lesynge, Seme not to be thus dyght. Therfore ye shall with law and ryght Ben put in a stronge pryson, For ye thynke to do me treason.” Kynge Rycharde sayd: “So mote j the, Thou dooth vnryght, so thynketh me, Palmers that gone by the waye, Them to pryson nyght or daye. Syr kynge, for thy courtesy, Do vs palmers no vylony! For his loue that we haue sought, Let vs go, and greue vs nought, For auentures that may betyde In straunge londes where thou ryde. The kynge commaunded anone, Into pryson þey schulde be done. The porter, j vnderstonde, Toke Rycharde by the honde, And bothe his felawes hym with. Lenger there had they no grith, Tyll that other daye at pryme The kynges sone came in euyll tyme; Wardrewe was his name, He was a knyght of grete fame. He was grete, stronge, and fere, In that londe was not his pere. “Porter,” he sayd, “j praye the, Thy prysoners lette me see!” The porter sayd: “Sir, at your wyll, Erly or late, loude or styll.” He brought them forth all thre, Rycharde formest tho came he, Wardrewe spake to hym than: “Arte þou Rycharde, the stronge man, As men saye in eche londe? Darste thou stonde a buffet of my honde, And to morowe j gyue the leue Suche another me to gyue?” Anone kynge Rycharde Graunted to that forwarde. The kynges sone, fyers and proute, Gaue Rycharde an eere cloute, Þat the fyre out of his eyen spronge. Rycharde thought he dyde hym wronge, And sware his othe by saynt Martyn: “To morowe I shall paye myn!” The kynges sone with good wyll Badde they sholde haue theyr fyll, Bothe of drynke, and eke of mete, Of the best that they wolde ete, That he myght not awyte For feblenes his dente to smyte; And into bedde be brought to reste, To quyte his that he be preste. The kynges sone was curtese, That nyghte he made hym well at ease. On the morowe whan it was daye, Rycharde rose as j you saye, Waxe he toke clere and bryght, And sone a fyre he hath hym dyght, And wexed his hondes by the fyre, Ouerthwarde and endlonge be you sure, A strawes brede thycke and more, For he thought to smyte sore With his honde he hath tyght, To make the paye that he hath hyght. The kynges sone came in than, To holde forwarde as a trewe man; And before Rycharde he stode, And spake to hym with ire and mode: “Smyte”, he sayd, “with all thy myght, As þou arte a stalworthe knyghte! And yf j stope or felde, Kepe me neuer to bere shelde.” Under his cheke Richarde his honde layde, He that it sawe the sothe sayd, Flesshe and skynne awaye he droughe, That he fell downe in a dede swoughe. In twoo he brak hys cheke-bon; He fel doun ded as ony ston. A kny?t sterte to þe kyng, And tolde hym þis tydyng, Þat Rychard had hys sone jslon. “Allas,” he sayde, “now haue j non!” Wiþ þat worde he fyl to grounde, As man þat was jn woo jbounde. He swownyd for sorwe at here ffeet, Kny?tes took hym vp fful skeet, And sayde: “Sere, let be þat þou?t! Now it is don it helpes nou?t.” The kyng spak þenne an hy To þe knyghtes þat stood hym by, “Tel me swyþe off þis caas, In what manere he ded was.” Stylle þay stood euerylkon, Ffor sorwe þey my?te telle non. Wiþ þat noyse þer com þe qwene. “Allas,” sche sayde, “hou may þis bene? Why is þis sorwe and þis ffare? Who has brou?t yow alle in care?” “Dame,” he sayde, “wost þou nou?t, Þy ffayre sone to deþe is brou?t! Siþþen þat j was born to man, Swylke sorwe hadde j neuere nan! Alle my ioye is turnyd to woo, Ffor sorwe j wole myseluen sloo!” Whenne þe qwene vndyrstood, Ffor sorwe, sertys, sche wax nygh wood. Her kerchefs she drewe, her heer also, “Alas,” she sayd, “what shall j do!” Sche cratched hereselff in þe vysage, As a wymman þat was in rage. þe face fomyd al on blood, Sche rente þe robe þat sche in stood, Wrong here handes þat sche was born: “Jn what manere is my sone jlorn?” Þe kyng sayde: “I telle þe, Þe kny?t here standes tolde it me. Now tel þe soþe, quod þe kyng þan, In what manere þis dede began; And, but þou þe soþe seye, An euele deþ schalt þou deye.” Þe kny?t callyd þe iayler, And bad þat he scholde stonde ner, To bere wytnesse off þat sawe, In what maner þat he was slawe. The iayler sayde: “?ystyrday, at pryme, ?oure sone com, in euyl tyme, To þe prisoun-dore to me. Þe palmeres he wolde see, And j fette hem forþ anon. þe fformeste Rychard gan gon. Ardru askyd, wiþouten let, ?yff he durste stonde hym a buffet, And he wolde hym anoþer stande, As he was trewe kny?t in land. And Rychard sayde: ‘Be þis ly?t, Smyt on, Sere, wiþ all þy my?t!’ Ardru so Rychard smette, Þat wel ny? he ouyrsette: ‘Rychard,’ he sayde, ‘now bydde j þe, To morwe anoþer now geue þou me!’ Þey departyd in þis wyse. At morwe Rychard gan aryse, And ?oure sone, anon he come, And Rychard agayn hym nome, As comenaunt was betwen hem tway. Rychard hym smot, forsoþe to say, Euene in twoo hys cheke-bon. He ffyl doun ded as ony ston. As j am sworn vnto ?ow here, Þus it was, in þis manere!” The kynge sayde wiþ egre wylle: “In prisoun þey schal leue stylle; And feteres on hem loke feste! Ffor þe dedes þat aren vnwrest, Þat he has my sone jslawe, He schal dye be ry?t lawe.” Þe porter ?ede, als he was sent, To don hys lordes comaundement. Þat day eete þey no meete, Ne no drynk my?te þey gete. The kyngys dou?tyr lay in her bour Wiþ here maydenys off honour; Margery here name hy?t, Sche louede Rychard wiþ al here my?t. At þe mydday, before þe noone, To þe prisoun sche wente soone, And, wiþ here, maydenes þree. “Jayler, sche sayde, let me see Þy prisouns now hastyly!” Bleþely he sayde: “Sykyrly.” Fforþ he ffette Rychard anon ry?t, Ffayr he grette þat lady bry?t, And sayde to here, wiþ herte ffree: “What is þy wylle, lady, wiþ me?” Whenne sche saw? hym wiþ eyen twoo, Here loue sche caste vpon hym þoo, And sayde: “Richard, saue God aboue, Off alle þyng most j þe loue!” “Allas,” he sayde, “in þat stounde, Wiþ wrong am j brou?t to grounde! What my?te my loue doo to þe? A pore prisoun, as þou may see. Þis is the thyrde day jgon Þat meete ne drynk ne hadde j non!” Þe lady hadde of hym pyte, And sayde, it scholde amendyd bee. Sche comaundyd þe jaylere Meete and drynk to fette hym þere: “And þe yryns from hym take, I comaunde þe, for my sake. And afftyr soper, in þe euenyng, To my chaumbyr þou hym bryng, In þe atyr off a squyer: Myselff j schal kepe hym þer. Be Jhesu Cryst, and Seynt Symoun, Þou schalt haue þy warysoun!” At euen þe porter forgat it nou?t, To here chaumbyr he hym brou?t. Wiþ þat lady he dwellyd stylle, And playde wiþ here al hys will. Tyl þe seuenth day, sykyrly, He ?ede and com fol priuyly. He was aspyyd off a kny?t, Þat to here chaumber he com o ny?t. Preuyly he tolde þe kyng, Fforleyn was hys dou?tyr ?yng. Þe kyng askyd hym ful soone: “Who þenne haþ þat dede jdon?” “Rychard,” he sayde, “þat tretour! He has don þis dyshonour. Sere, be my crystyndome, I saw? whenne he ?ede and come.” Þe kyng in herte sykyd sore, To hym þenne spak he no more, But swyþe, wiþouten fayle, He sente afftyr his counsayle, Erlys, barouns, and wyse clerkes, To telle off þese wooful werkes. Þe messangerys gunne forþ gon, Hys counsaylleres, þey come anon. By þat it was þe fourtenþe day They were comen, as j ?ow say. Al wiþ on þey gretten þe kyng, Þe soþe to say, wiþouten lesyng. “Lordynges,” he sayde, “welcome alle!” Þey wente hem forþ into an halle, Among hem þe kyng hym set. “I shall you tell wiþouten let, Why j haue afftyr ?ow sent: To geue a traytour iugement, Þat has don me gret tresoun: Kyng Rychard is in my prisoun.” Alle he tolde hem, in hys sawe, Hou he hadde hys sone jslawe, And hys dou?tyr also forlayn: “Þat he were ded j were ful ffayn! But now it is ordeyned soo, Men schal no kyng to deþ doo.” To hym spak a bold baroun: “Hou com Kyng Rychard in prisoun? He is halden so noble a kyng, To hym dar no man doo no þyng.” Þe kyng hym tolde in all wyse, Hou he fond hym in dysguyse, And wiþ hym oþere twoo barouns, Noble men off gret renouns: “I took hem, þorw? suspeccyoun, In þis manere to my prisoun.” He took leue at hem ylkone, Into a chaumbyr he bad hem gon Ffor to take here counsayle, What hem my?te best avayle. In here speche þey dwellyd þare Þre dayes and sumdel mare, And stroue faste, as they were wode, With grete errour and egere mode. Some wolde haue hym a dawe, And some sayde it was no lawe. In þis manere, for here iangelyng, Þey my?te acorde for no þyng. Þe wyseste sayde: “Verament, We can hym geue no iugement.” Þus answeryd þey þe kyng, Sertaynly, wiþouten lesyng. A kny?t spak swyþe to þe kyng: “Sere, greue ?ow no þyng, For Sere Eldryd, for soþe, jwis, He can telle what best is, Ffor he is wys man off red, Manye has he don to ded.” Þe kyng bad, wiþouten lette, Þat he were before hym fette. He was brou?t before þe kyng; He askyd hym, in hys sayyng: “Canst þou telle me, in ony manere, Off Kyng Rychard þat j vengyd were?” He answeryd wiþ herte ffree: “þeron j moot avyse me. ?e weten weel, it is no lawe A kyng to hange and to drawe. ?e schal doo, be my resoun: Hastely takes ?oure lyoun, And wiþhaldes hym hys meete, Þree dayes þat he nou?t eete; And R. into chaumbyr ?e doo, And lete þe lyoun wende hym too: In þis manere he schal be slawe. Þenne dost þou nou?t agayn þe lawe: Þe lyoun schal hym þere sloo, Þenne art þou wroken off þy foo.” Þe mayde aspyyd þat resoun, Þat he scholde dye þorw? tresoun, And afftyr hym sone sche sente, To warne hym off þat iugemente. When he to þe chaumbyr com þan: “Welcome,” sche sayde, “my lemman! My lord has ordeynyd þe þorw? red Þe þrydde day to be don to ded. Into a chaumbyr þou schalt be doo, A lyoun schal be late þe too, Þat is forhongryd swyþe sore; Þanne wot j wel, þou leuyst no more! But, leue lemman, þenne sayde sche, To ny?t we wole off lande fflee; Wiþ gold, and syluer, and gret tresore, Inow? to haue ffor eueremore.” Rychard sayde: “J vndyrstande Þat were agayn þe lawe of lande, Away to wende wiþouten leue: Þe kyng ne wole j nou?t so greue. Off þe lyoun ne geue j nought, Hym to sle now haue j þou?t. Be pryme, on þe þrydde day, I geue þe hys herte to pray.” Keuercheues he askyd off sylk, Ffourty, whyte as ony mylk: “To þe prisoun þou hem bryng, A lytyl before þe euenyng.” Whenne it to þe tyme cam, Þe wey to þe prisoune þe mayden nam, And wiþ here a noble kny?t. Here soper was redy jdy?t. Rychard bad hys twoo feres Come to hym to here soperes: “And þou, sere porter, alsoo, Þe lady comaundes þe þertoo.” Þat ny?t þey were glad jnow?, And sythen to þe chaumbyr þey drow?: But Rychard and þat swete wy?t Dwellyd togeddere al þat ny?t. At morwe, whenne it was day, Rychard here prayde to wende here way. “Nay,” sche sayde, “be God aboue, I schal dye here ffor þy loue! Ry?t now here j wole abyde, Þou? me scholde þe deþ betyde. Sertes, henne wole j nou?t wende, I shall take the grace that God will sende!” Rychard sayde: “Lady ffree, But ?yff þou wende swyþe ffro me, Þou schalt greue me so sore, Þat j schal loue þe no more.” Þer agayn sche sayde: “Nay! Lemman, haue now good day! God, þat deyde vpon þe tree Saue þe ?yff hys wylle bee!” Þe keuercheues he took on honde, Abouten hys arme he hem wonde. He þou?te in þat ylke wyle To sloo þe lyoun wiþ sum gyle, And seyngle in a kertil he stood, Abood the lyon fers and wood. Wiþ þat com þe iaylere, And oþere twoo wiþ hym in ffere, And þe lyoun hem among, His pawes were boþe scharp and long. The chambre dore they hafe vndo, And the lyon lete hym to. Rychard cryed: “Help, Ihesu!” Þe lyoun made a gret venu, And wolde haue hym al torent; Kyng Rychard þenne besyde he glent, Vpon þe brest þe lyoun he spurnyd, Þat al aboute þe lyoun turnyd. Þe lyoun was hungry and megre, And bette hys tayl, ffor to be egre, Ffaste aboute, on þe wowes; Abrod he spredde alle hys powes, And cryed lowde, and gapyd wyde. Kyng Rychard beþou?te hym þat tyde What hym was best, and to hym sterte, In at hys þrote hys arme he gerte, Rente out þe herte wiþ hys hand, Lungges, and lyvere, and al þat he fand. Þe lyoun fel ded to þe grounde, Rychard hadde neyþer wemme ne wounde. He knelyd doun in þat place, And thankyd Jhesu off hys grace, Þat hym kepte fro schame and harme. He took þe herte, al so warme, And brou?te it into þe halle, Before þe kyng and hys men alle. Þe kyng at meete sat on des, Wiþ dukes and erles, prowde in pres. Þe saler on þe table stood, Rychard prest out al þe blood, And wette þe herte in þe salt,— Þe kyng and alle hys men behalt— Wiþouten bred þe herte he eet. Þe kyng wonderyd, and sayde skeet: “Iwis, as j vndyrstonde can, Þis is a deuyl and no man, Þat has my stronge lyoun slawe, Þe herte out of hys body drawe, And has it eeten wiþ good wylle! He may be callyd, be ry?t skylle, Kyng jcrystenyd off most renoun, Stronge Rychard Coer de Lyoun!” Now off þis lete we bee, And off þe kyng speke we. In care and moornyng he ledes hys lyff, And offten he calles hymselff caytyff, Bannes þe tyme þat he was born, Ffor hys sone þat was forlorn, And hys dou?tyr þat was bylayn, And hys lyoun þat was soo slayn. Erlys and barouns come hym too, And hys qwene dene alsoo, And askyd hym what hym was. “?e weten weel”, he seyde, “my caas, And why j leue in strong dolour; Ffor Rychard, þe stronge traytour, Has me wrou?t so mekyl woo. I may hym nou?t to deþe doo, Þerfore j wole, ffor hys sake, Raunsun ffor hys body take, Ffor my dou?tyr þat he has schent Agayn þe staat off sacrement: Off euery kyrke þat preest in syng, Messe in saye, or belle in ryng, Þere twoo chalyses inne be, Þat on schal be brou?t to me; And ?yff þer bee moo þan þoo, Þe haluyndel schal come me too. Whenne j am seruyd off that ffee, Þenne schal Rycharde delyueryd bee. And my doughter for her outrage Shall forgoo her herytage. Þus, he sayde, it schal be doo.” Þe barouns grauntyd weel þertoo. Kyng Rychard þey afftyr sente, Ffor to here þat ordeynemente. Kyng Rychard com into þe halle, And grette þe kyng, and hys men alle. Þenne sayde þe kyng: “Verrayment, We haue lokyd, þorw? iugement, Þat þou schalt paye raunsoun, Ffor þe and þy twoo baroun. Off euery kyrke in þy land Þou schalt doo me come to hand: Þere twoo chalys inne bee, Þat on schal be brou?t to mee; And ?iff þer bee moo þen þoo, Þe haluyndel schal come me too: Þorw?out þy land, wete it weel, I wole haue þe haluyndel. Whenne þou hast þus maad þy pay, I geue þe leue to wende þy way, And my dou?tyr alsoo wiþ þe, Þat j ?ow neuere wiþ eyen see.” Kyng Rychard sayde: “As þou hast told, To þat fforewarde j me hold.” Kyng Rychard, curteys and hende, Seyde: “Who wole for me wende To Engeland to my chaunceler Þat my raunsoun be payde her? And who so dos it, wiþouten ffayle, J schal aquyte hym weel his trauayle.” Vp þer stood an hende kny?t: “Þe message j wole doo ful ry?t.” Kyng Rychard dede a lettre wryte— A noble clerk it gan adyte—, And made þerjnne mensyoun, More and lesse, off the raunsoun. “Gretes weel, as j ?ow say, Boþe myn erchebysshopys tway, And so ?e doo my chaunceler, To serue þe lettre in alle maner, In no manere þe lettre ffayle; Sykyrly, it schal hem auayle.” Hys seel þeron he has set, Þe kny?t it takes wiþouten let, Dy?tes him, and made hym ?are, Ouer þe see ffor to ffare. Whenne he was þerouer jbrou?t, To gon hys way forgat he nou?t; To London he hyyd hym anon, Þere he fond hem euerylkon. He took þe lettre, as j ?ow say, To þe erchebysshopys tway, And bad hem faste don it rede, Ffor it was sent ffor mekyl nede. Þe chaunceler þe wex tobrak, Sone he wyste what it spak. Þe lettre was rede among hem alle, What þeroffe scholde beffalle: Hou kyng Rychard wiþ tresoun Jn Alemayne dwelles ffor raunsoun; Þe kynges sone he has slayn, And also hys dou?tyr he haþ forlayn, And alsoo slayn hys lyoun: Alle þese harmes he haþ don. Þey boden clerkys fforþ to wende To euery kyrke fer and hende, Hastely þat it were sped, And þe tresore to hym led. “Messanger”, þenne sayden hee, “Þou schalt dwelle, and haue wiþ þe Ffyue bysschopys to ryde þe by, And ffyue barouns sykyrly, And oþere folk jnowe wiþ þee; In vs ne schal not ffawte bee.” Off euery kyrke lesse and more Þey gaderyd vp al þe tresore, And ouer þe see þenne are þey went, Ffor to make þe ffayr present. Whenne þey comen þe cite too, Þe ryche kyng þey gretten þoo, And sayden, as þey were beþou?t: “Sere, þy raunsoun is here brou?t; Takes it al to ?oure wyl, Lat goo þese men as it is skyl.” Sayde þe kyng: “I geue hem leue, I ne schal hem no more greue.” He took hys dou?tyr by þe hand, And bad here swyþe deuoyde his land. Þe qwene saw? what scholde falle, Here dou?tyr sche gan to chaumbyr calle, And sayde: “þou schalt dwelle wiþ me, Tyl Kyng Rychard sende afftyr þee, As a kyng dos afftyr his qwene. So j rede þat it schal bene.” Kyng Richard, and hys feres twoo, Took here leue, and gunne to goo Home agayn vnto Yngelonde, Þankyd be Ihesu Crystys sonde. Þey come to Londoun, þat cite. Hys erles, and hys barouns ffree, Þey þankyd God al so blyue, Þat þey sey? here lord on lyue. Hys twoo fferes wenten home, Here ffrendes were glad off here come; Baþid here bodyys, þat were sore Ffor þe trauayle þat þey hadde before. Þus þay dwellyd halff a ?er, Among here ffrendes off gret power, Tyl þey were stalworþ to ffond. Þe kyng comaundyd, þorw? þe lond, At London to make a parlement, Non wiþstonde his comaundement, As þey wolden sauen here lyff, And here chyldren, and here wyff. To Londoun, to hys somoun, Come erl, bysshop, and baroun, Abbotes, pryours, kny?tes, squyers, Burgeyses, and manye bachelers, Seriauntes, and euery ffreholdande, Þe kynges heste to vndyrstande. Beffor þat tyme a gret cuntre Þat was be?onde þe Grykyssche see, Acres, Surry, and ffele landes, Were in Crystene-mennes handes; And þe croys þat Cryst was on ded, Þat bou?te vs alle fro þe qued; And al þe cuntree of Bethleem, And þe toun off Ierusalem, Off Nazareth, and off Ierycho, And al Galylee alsoo. Ylke palmere and ylke pylgryme Þat wolde þedyr goo þat tyme, My?te passe, wiþ good entent, Wiþouten raunsoun, and ony rent, Oþer off syluyr, or off golde, To euery plase þat he wolde; Ffond he no man hym to myssay, Ne wiþ euele hondes on hym to lay. Off Surry-land þe Duke Myloun Was lord þat stounde, a bold baroun. Mawgre þe Sawdon þat lond he heeld, And weryd it weel wiþ spere and scheeld. He, and þe dou?ty Erl Renaud Wel offten gaff hym wol hard assaut, And wol offten in playn batayle Þey slowe kny?tes and gret putayle Off Sarezynys þat mysbeleuyd: Þe Sawdon was sore agreuyd. Lystenes off a tresoun strong Off þe Eerl Roys þat was hem among, To whom Myloun tryste mekyl: And he was traytour fals and fykyl; Þe Sawdon stylly to hym sente, And behy?te hym land and rente, The Crystene hoost to betrayen; Whanne he hadde wunne hem, to payen Off gold many a þousand pounde; Þe eerl grauntyd hym þat stounde. Anoþer traytour, Markes Fferaunt, He wyste alsoo off þat comenaunt. He hadde part of þe gold þe eerl took, And afftyrward Crystyndome forsook. Þus þorw? tresoun of þe Eerl Roys Surry was lorn and þe holy croys. Þe Duke Renaud was hewe smale, Al to pesys, so says oure tale. Þe Duke Myloun was geuen hys lyff, And ffley? out off lande wiþ hys wyff, —He was heyr off Surry lande, Kyng Bawdewynys sone, j vndyrstande— Þat no man wyste neuere siþþe Where he become, ne in what kiþþe: So þat þis los and þis pite, Sprong out þorw? al Crystyante. An holy Pope, þat hy?te Vrban, Sente to eche a Crystene man, And asoylyd hem off here synne, And gaff hem paradys to wynne, Alle þat wolde þedyr gon, To wreke Ihesu off hys ffoon. Þe Kyng off Ffraunce, wiþouten ffayle, Þedyr he wente wiþ gret vytayle, Þe Duke off Bloys, þe Duke off Burgoyne, Þe Duke off Ostryche, and þe Duke of Cessoyne, And þe Emperour off Alemayne, And þe goode kny?tes off Bretayne, Þe Eerl of Fflaundres, þe Eerl off Coloyne, Þe Eerl of Artays, þe Eerl off Boloyne. Mekyl folk wente þedyr beffore Þat ny? hadde here lyff fforlore, In gret werre and hongyr hard, As ?e may here afftyrward. In heruest, afftyr þe natiuite, Kyng Richard wiþ gret solempnite At Westemynstyr heeld a ryal ffeste Wiþ bysschop, eerl, baroun honeste, Abbotes, kny?tes, swaynes strong. And afftyr mete hem among Þe kyng stood vp and gan to sayn: “My leue ffrendes, j wole ?ow prayn, Beþ in pes, lystenes my tale, Erlys, barouns, grete and smale, Bysschop, abbot, lewyd and lerde! Al Crystyndom may ben aferde! Þe Pope Vrban has to vs sent Hys bulle and his comaundement Hou þe Sawdon has fy?t begunne; Þe toun off Acres he has wunne Þorw? þe Eerl Roys and hys trehcherye, And al þe kyngdom off Surrye. Ierusalem and þe croys is lorn, And Bethleem, þere Ihesu Cryst was born. Þe Crystene kny?tes be hangyd and drawe; Þe Sarezynys haue hem now jslawe, Crystene men, chyldren, wyff, and grome. Wherefore þe lord, þe Pope off Rome, Is agreuyd and anoyyd Þat Crystyndom is þus destroyyd. Ilke Crystene kyng he sendes bode, And byddes in þe name off Gode To wende þedyr, wiþ gret hoost, Ffor to ffelle þe Sarezynys bost. Wherefore myselff, j haue mente, To wende þedyr, wiþ swerdes dente Wynne þe croys, and gete los. Now, ffrendes, what is youre purpos? Wole ?e wende? Says ?e or nay!” Erles, barouns, knyghtis, and alle þat maye Sayde: “We ben at on acord To wende wiþ þe, Rychard, oure lord!” Quod þe kyng: “Frendes, gromercy! It is oure honour, lystenys why! Wendes and grauntes þe Pope his bon, As oþere Crystene kynges haue don. Þe Kyng off Ffraunse is went forþ. I rede est, west, souþ, and norþ In Yngelonde þat we do crye, And maken a playn croyserye.” Mekyl ffolk þe croys haue nomen; To Kyng Rychard þey were comen On hors and ffoot, wel aparaylyd. Twoo hondryd schyppys ben wel vitailid, Wiþ flour, hawberkes, swerdys, and knyuys; Þrittene schyppys jlade wiþ hyuys; Off tymbyr grete and schydys long He leet make a tour fful strong, Þat queynteyly engynours made; Þerwiþ þree schyppys were wel lade. Anoþer schyp was laden ?et Wiþ an engine hy?te Robynet— It was Rychardys o mangenel—, And al þe takyl þat þerto ffel. Whenne þey ware dy?t al ?are, Out off hauene ffor to ffare, Ihesu hem sente wynd ful good, To bere hem ouer þe salte fflood. Kyng Rychard sayde to hys schipmen: “Ffrendes, doþ as j ?ow ken! And Maystyr Aleyn Trenchemere, Wheþer ?e come ffer or nere, And ?e meten be þe see stronde Schyppys off ony oþer londe, Þo Crystene men, on lyff and leme Looke no goodes ?e hem beneme! And ?yff ?e ony Sarezynys mete, Loke on lyue þat ?e non lete! Catayl, dromoun, and galeye, Al j ?ow ?eue vnto ?oure preye. But at þe cyte off Marchyle, Þere ?e moot abyde a whyle, Be cable and ankyr ffor to ryde, Me and myn hoost ffor to abyde, Ffor j and my kny?tes of mayn Wole hastyly wende þorw?

But he my tresore agayn ?elde Þat he off me took wiþ ffalshede, I schal quyten hym hys mede.” Þus Kyng Rychard, as ?e may here, Bycome Goddys owne palmere. Agayns Goddys wyþirwynys Þe erchebysschop Sere Bawdewynys Beffore wente wiþ kny?tys ffyn Be Braundys and be Constantyn: And al þe last, þenne afftyrward, Þenne come þe dou?ty kyng Rychard. Þree hoostes Kyng Richard gan make Into heþenesse, ffor Goddys sake: In þe fforme warde hymselff wolde be Wiþ hardy men off gret pouste. Þat oþer ledes Ffouke Doyly Thomas þe þrydde, sykyrly. Euery hoost wiþ hym gan lede Ffourty þousande goode at nede, Non þerjnne but man off my?t Þat were wel prouyd in werre and fy?t. Kyng Rychard callyd hys iustys: “Lokes, þat ?e doo be my deuys! My land kepes wiþ skele and lawe: Traytours lokes ?e honge and drawe. In my stede schal be here Þe bysschop of ?ork, my chauncelere. I wole þat ?e ben at hys wylle, To wyrke afftyr ry?t and skylle, Þat j hereafftyr here no stryff, As ?e wole saue ?owre owne lyff! And in þe name off God almy?t, Ledes þe pore men be ry?t!” Þertoo heeld þey vp here hand, Wiþ ry?t to lede al Yngeland. Bysschopys gaff hem here benysoun, And prayde ffor hem in kyrke and toun; And prayde Jhesu Cryst hem spede, In heuene to quyte hem here mede! Now is Kyng Rychard passid þe see; Sone he delte hys hoost in þre, Ffor he wolde nou?t þe ffolk anoye, And here goodes nou?t destroye, Ne noþyng take wiþouten pay. Þe kyng comaundyd, as j ?ow say, Euery hoost ffro oþir ten myle: Þus he ordeynyd, þat whyle, In þe myddyl hoost hymselff to ryde, And hys hoostes on boþe syde. Fforþ þey wenten, wiþouten ensoyne, To þe cyte off Coloyne. Þe hye mayere off þat cyte Comaundyd, as j schal telle þee, No man selle hem no ffowayle Ffor no thyng þat my?te avayle. Þe styward tolde Richard þe kyng Sone anon off þat tydyng Þat he my?te no ffowayle beye, Neyþer ffor loue, neyther ffor eye: “Þus deffendes Modard þe kyng, Ffor he ?ow hates ouyr alle thyng. Weel he woot þat ?e haue swore, Al þat ?e take to paye þerfore; ?e wole take wiþ no maystry: Þerfore he wenes, sykyrly, Þat ?e schal haue mete non; Þus he þynkes ?oure men to slon.” Kyng Richard answerid as hym þou?t: “Þat ne schal vs lette nou?t. Now styward, j commaunde þee, Bye vs vessel gret plente, Dysschys, cuppys, and sawsers, Bolles, treyes, and plateres, Fattys, tunnes, and costret, Makes oure mete wiþouten let, Wheþer ?e wole seþe or brede; And þe pore men, so God ?ow spede, Þat ?e ffynde in þe toun, Þat þey come at my somoun.” Whenne þe mete was greyþid and dy?t, Þe kyng comaundyd to a kny?t, Afftyr þe mayr for to wende, And other burgesse good and hende. Þe mayr come, as j haue sayde, Bord and cloþ was redy layde. Anon þey were to borde sette, And ffayr seruyse beffore hem fette. Kyng Rychard askyd in hyyng: “Sere mayr, where is þy lord þe kyng?” “Sere,” he sayde, “at Gumery, Sykyrly, withouten ly; And alsoo my lady þe qwene; Þe þrydde day ?e schal hem sene; And Margery, his dou?tyr ffree, Þat of ?owre comyng glad wil be.” Þay waschede, as it was lawe off land; A messanger þer come rydand, Vpon a stede whyt so mylke, Hys trappys were off tuely sylke, Wiþ fyue hondryd belles ryngande, Wel ffayr off sy?t, j vndirstande. And doun off hys stede he ly?t, And grette Kyng Rychard fayre, i ply?t: “Þe kynges dou?tyr, þat is so ffree, Sche þe gretes weel by me: Wiþ an hondryd kny?tes, and moo, Sche comes, ar þou to bedde goo.” Kyng Rychard answeryd in hyyng: “Welcome”, he sayde, “ouyr alle þyng!” He made ryght merye þe messangere, Wiþ glad semblaunt and merye chere, And gaff hym a cloþ off golde, Ffor he was to hym leeff jhold. Þey come to hym þat ylke ny?t, Þe kny?tes and þe lady bry?t. Whenne Kyng Richard my?te here see, “Welcome, lemman!” sayde hee. Ayþer off hem oþir gan kysse, And made mekyl ioye and blysse. Þenne þey dwellyd tyl it were day, At morwe þey wenten in here way. At mydday, before þe noon, Þey comen to a cyte boon, Þe name was callyd Marburette; Þere þe kyng hym wolde lette. Hys marschal swyþe com hym too: “Sere,” he sayde, “hou schole we doo? Swylk ffowayle as we bou?te ?istyrday, Ffor no catel gete j may.” Rychard answeryd, wiþ herte ffree: “Off ffroyt here is gret plente! Ffyggys, and raysyns in ffrayel, And notes may serue vs ffol wel, And wex sumdel caste þertoo, Talw? and grese menge alsoo; And þus ?e may oure mete make, Seþþen ?e mowe non oþer take.” Þere þey dwellyd al þat ny?t; On þe morwe to wenden þey haue jty?t To þe cyte off Carpentras, Þere Kyng Modard hymselff was. Ffurþer þenne my?te he ffle hym nou?t; Þorw? þe land he hadde hym sou?t. Kyng Rychard hys hostel gan take, Þere he gan hys ferste wrak Wiþ gret wrong agayn þe ry?t, Ffor þe goos þat he hadde dy?t. Kyng Modard wot Rychard is come, Weel he wenes to be nome, And in prisoun ay to bee: “But ?yff my dou?tyr helpe mee!” Sche come to hym þere he sat: “What now, fadyr, hou is þat?” “Sertys, dou?tyr, j gete blame, But ?iff þow helpe, j goo to schame.” “Sertes, Sere,” sche sayde þan, “As j am gentyl womman, ?yff ?e wole be mylde off mood, Kyng Rychard wole do ?ow but good. But grauntes hym, wiþ good wylle, Þat he wil aske, to ffulffylle. And dos ?ou al in hys mercy; ?e schole be kyssyd, be oure lady! ?e þat haue ben soo wroþe, Flul ffayre acordyd ?e schal be boþe, And eke alsoo my lady þe qwene; Goode ffrendes þenne schole ?e bene.” Sche took here ffadyr, and wiþ hym ?ede To Kyng Rychard, as j ?ow rede; And alsoo erles, and barouns moo, And syxty kny?tes wiþouten þoo. Kyng Richard saw? hou þat he com, Þe way agayns hym he nom. Kyng Modard on knees hym sette, Þere Kyng Rychard ful fayre he grette, And sayde: “Sere, j am at þy wylle.” Sayde Rychard: “I wole nou?t but sky[lle]. Wiþ so þou ?elde agayn my tresore, I schal þe loue ffor eueremore, Loue þe, and be þy ffrende!” Quod Kyng Modard: “My sone hende, J wole þe swere vpon a book, Redy is it j off þe took; Redy is al þy tresore, And ?yff þou wylt as mekyl more, J schal þe geue, my pes to make!” Kyng Rychard gan hym in armes tak[e], And kyste hym fful ffele syþe: Þey were ffrendes, and made hem blyþe. That ylke day Kyng Modard Eet, jwis, wiþ Kyng Rychard. And afftyr mete, sone and swyþe, Kyng Rychard spak, wiþ chere blyþe, To þe kyng þat sat hym by: “Welcome be þou sykyrly! Sere, for þy loue j praye þe Off þyn help to wende wiþ me To heþynnesse, wiþouten ffayle, Ffor Goddes loue to geue batayle.” Þe kyng grauntyd al in griþ, Al hys land-folk to wende hym wiþ, “And myselff to wende þertoo.”— “Nay,” quod Rychard, “j wole nou?t so! Þou art to old to bykyr in ffy?t; But j pray þe, þat þou me dy?t An hondryd kny?tes, styff to stande, Of þe beste in al þy lande; And off vytayle redy bon, Ffor al a ?er þat it be don, And squyers þat ffalles hem too.” Þe kyng grauntyd to be soo. “Anoþer þyng j schal þe geue Þat may þe helpe whyl þat þou leue: Twoo ryche rynges off gold; Þe stones þerjnne be ffol bold. Hennes to þe lond off Ynde, Betere þenne schalt þou non fynde: Ffor who soo has þat on ston, Watyr ne schal hym drenche non; That oþir ston who so it bere, Ffyr ne schal hym neuere dere.” Sere,” quod Rychard, “graunt mercy!” Hys kny?tes weren dy?t al redy, Seriauntes of armes, and squyers; Stedes chargyd, and destrers Wiþ armure and oþir vytayle; Kyng Richard wente wiþ his parayle. To Marcyle þey gunne ryde, And hys hoostes on boþe syde. Ffouk Doyly, Thomas off Multon, Duke, eerl, and many baroun; Rychardys maystyr Roberd off Leycester, In al Yngelond was non his betere; And alsoo Robert Tourneham, Gret Englysshe peple wiþ hym cam. Al redy þey ffounde þer here fflete, Chargyd wiþ armure, drynk, and mete. Þey schyppyd armes, man, and stede, And stoor here folk al wiþ to ffede. Þey schyppyd al be þe see stronde, To wende into þe Holy Londe. Þe wynd was boþe good and kene, And droff hem ouyr to Messene. Beffore þe ?ates off þe Gryffouns, Kyng Rychard py?te his pauylouns. Þe Kyng off Fraunce þere he founde, In pauylouns quarre and rounde; And eyþyr off hem kyste oþir, And becomen sworen broþir, To wenden into þe Holy Londe, To wreke Jhesu, j vndyrstonde. A tresoun þou?te þe Kyng of Fraunce, To doo Kyng R. a destaunce. To Kyng Tanker he sente a wryt, Þat turnyd hym siþene to lytyl wyt, Þat Kyng Richard wiþ strenþe of hand Wolde hym dryue out of his land. Tanker Kyng of Poyle was, Ffor þis wryt he sayde “Allas!” He sente anon a messanger To hys sone þat hy?te Roger, Þat was kyng in Sesyle-land, He scholde come vnto hys hand; And alsoo afftyr hys barouns, Erles and lordes off renouns. And whenne þey were jcome ylkon, Þe kyng sayde to hem anon, And tolde hym hou þe Kyng of Fraunce Had warnyd hym off a dystaunce, Hou Kyng Rychard was come fro ferre, Wiþ gret strengþe on hym to werre. Kyng Roger spak ffyrst aboue, And smot pes wiþ hys gloue: “Mercy, my ffadyr, at þis tyme! Kyng Richard is a pylgryme Croysyd into þe Holy Lande; Þat wryt lyes, j vndyrstande. J dar ffor Kyng Rychard swere Ffor hym ne tydes ?ow neuere dere. But sendes to hym a messangere, Þat he come vnto ?ow here; He wil come to ?ow fful ffawe, And þat he þynkes he wyl beknawe.” Þe kyng was payyd off þat counsayle, And sente afftyr hym saunt ffayle. At morwen he com to hym jwis, Into þe ryche cyte off Rys. He ffond Kyng Tanker in hys halle, Among hys erlys and barouns alle. Eyþer grette oþir ful ffayre, Wiþ mylde wurdes and debonayre. Þenne sayde Tanker to Kyng Richard: “Loo, Sere Kyng, be Seynt Leonard, Me it is jdon for to wyt Off ffrendes be a fol good wryt, Þat þou art [co]men wiþ gret powere, Me to bereue my landes here. Þou were ffayrere to be a pylgrym, Ffor to sloo many a paynym, Þenne for to greue a Cristene kyng Þat neuere mysdede þe no þyng!” Kyng Richard was sore aschamyd, And off hys wurdes sore agramyd, And sayde: “Tanker, þou art mystau?t, To haue on me swylke a þou?t, And swylke a rage vpon me bere, Þat i þe scholde wiþ armes dere, And swylke a tresoun to me sopos: Vpon my flesch i bere þe cros! I wole dwelle but a day, Tomorwe i wole wende my way. And i praye the, Syr Tanker kynge, Procure me none evyll thynge! For many man weneth to greue other, And on his heed falleth the fother. For who so wayteth me despyte, Hymselfe shall nought passe quyte.” “Syr,” quod Tanker, “be not wrothe for this! Lo here the letter, forsothe, iwis, That the Kynge of Fraunce me sente That other daye in presente!” Kynge Rycharde sawe and vnderstode The kynge of Fraunce wolde hym no gode. Kynge Rycharde and Kynge Tanker kyste, And were frends with the beste That myght be in ony londe; Blessyd be Ihesu Chrystes sonde! Kynge Rycharde wente agayne well styll, And suffred the Frenssch kynges wyll. He vndyde his tresore, And bought bestes to his store; He let bothe salte and slene Three thousande oxen and kene, Swyne and shepe so many also, No man coude tell tho. Of whete and benys twenty thowsinde Quarters he boughte als þat j fynde; Of fysshe, foules, and venyson, I ne can nought account in ryght reason. The Kynge of Fraunce, without wene, Laye in the cyte of Messene, And Kynge Rycharde without the wall, Under the house of the Hospytall. The Englysshe-men wente to chepyng, And ofte hente harde knockynge; The Frensshe and Gryffons downe ryghtes Slewe there our Englysshe knyghtes. Kynge Rycharde herde of that dystaunce, And playned to the kynge of Fraunce; And he answered, he helde no wardes Of the Englysshe taylardes. “Chase the Gryffons yf thou myght, For of my men getest thou no ryght!” Quod Kynge Rycharde: “Syth it is so I wote well what i haue to do: I shall me of them so awreke, That all the worlde therof shall speke.” Chrystmasse is a tyme full honeste, Kynge Rycharde it honoured with grete feste. All his erles and his barons Were set in theyr pauylyouns, And were serued with grete plente Of mete and drynke and eche deynte. Than came there a knyght in grete haste, Unneth he myght draw his blaste; He fell on knees and thus he sayd: “Mercy Rycharde, for Mary mayde! With the Frensshmen and the Gryffownes My brother lyeth slayne in the townes, And with hym lyeth slayne fyftene Of thy knyghtes good and kene. This daye and yesterdaye, i tolde a rowe, That syxe and thyrty they had yslowe! Fast lesseth your Englissh hepe, Good Syr, take good kepe! Awreke vs, Syr, manly, Or we shall right hastely Flee peryll, i vnderstonde, And tourne agayne to Englonde.” Kynge Rycharde was wrothe, and eger of mode, And loked as he were wode; The table with his fote he smote, That it wente on the flore fote-hote, And swore he wold be awreked in haste, He wolde not wende for Chrystes faste. The hygh daye of Chrystmasse They gan them arme more and lasse. Before wente Kynge Rycharde, The Erle of Salysbury afterwarde, That was called by that daye Syr Wyllyam the Longespaye, The Erle of Leycestre, the Erle of Herdforde, Full comly folowed they theyr lorde. Erles, barons, and squyers, Bowmen, speremen, and arblasteres, With Kynge Rycharde they gan reke, Of Frensshe and Gryffons to be awreke. The folke of þe cyte aspyed rathe That the Englysshe men wolde do them skathe. They shette hastely the gate With barres that they founde therate, And swythe they ranne on the wall, And shotte with bowe and spryngall, And called to our men saunce fayle: “Go hom, dogges, with your tayle! For all your boost and your orguyl Men shall threste in your cuyle!” Thus they mysdyde and myssayde; All that daye Kynge Rycharde they trayde. Our kynge that daye for no nede In batayll myght nothynge spede. On nyght Kynge Rycharde and his barons Wente to theyr pauylyouns. Who that slepte, or who that woke, Kyng Rycharde that nyght no reste toke. On the morowe he ofsente his counseyllers, And of the portes the mayster maryners. “Lordynges,” he sayd, “ye ben with me; Our counsell ought to be pryue. Al we sholde vs venge fonde, With queyntyse and with strength of honde, Of the Frensshe and of the Gryffons That haue dyspysed our nacyons. I haue a castell, i vnderstonde, Was made of tembre of Englonde, With syxe stages full of tourelles Well flourysshed with cornelles; Therin i and many a knyght Ayenst the Frensshe shall take the fyght. That castell shall haue a surnom, It shall hyght the Mate-Gryffon. Maryners, arme wele your shyppes, And holde vp your manshyppes, By the water-halfe ye them assayle, And we by the londe saunce fayle; For joye come neuer to me Tyll i of them awrecked be!” Therto men myght here crye: “Helpe God and Saynt Mary!” The maryners them gan hye, Bothe with shyppe and with galye, With ore, spredde, and sayle also Towarde the cite they gan go. The knyghtes framed the tre-castell Before the cyte vpon an hyll. All this sawe the Kynge of Fraunce, And sayd: “Haue ye no doutaunce Of all these Englyssh cowardes, For they ne be but mossardes; Drisses now your mangenell, And caste to theyr tre-castell, And shote to them with arblast, The tayled dogges for to agast!” Now harken of Rycharde, our kynge, How he let bere in the dawnynge Targes and hurdis his folke all Right before the cyte-wall. His hoost he let at ones crye— Men myght it here into the skye—: “Now let come the Frenssh mosardes, And gyue batayll to the taylardes!” Þe Fresshemen them armed all, And ranne on hast vpon the wall; And gun defende, þe Englysshe for to assayle: There began a stronge batayle. The Englysshe drew with arblast and bowe, Frenssh and Gryffons fast they slowe. The galeys came to the cyte, And had nygh wonne entre. They hadde so myned vnder the wall, That many Gryffons gan downe fall; With hoked arowes and quarelles They felle out of the tourelles, And brake bothe legges, and arme, And eke theyr neckes: it was none harme. The Frensshmen came to the stoure, And caste wylde fyre out of the toure; Therwith i wote, forsothe, iwys, They brent and slew many Englysshe. And the Englysshmen defended them wele With good swerdes of browne stele, And slewe of them so grete chepes, That there laye moche folke on hepes; And at the londe-gate Kynge Rycharde Helde his assawte ylyke harde, And so manly he toke one, He loste of his men neuer one. He loked besyde, and sawe houe A knyght that weued hym with a gloue. Kynge Rycharde come, and he hym tolde Tales in Englyssh, stoute and bolde: “A lorde, i haue aspyed now ryght A thinge that maketh myn herte lyght. Here”, he sayd, “is a gate one That hath warde ryght none. The folke is gone to the water-toure For to do them there socoure, And there we may withouten dente Entre in now, veramente.” Blythe therof was Kynge Rycharde, Stoutly he wente thederwarde, Many a knyght, doughty of dede, After hym prycked vpon theyr stede. Kynge Rycharde entred without drede, Hym folowed full grete felawrede. His baner vpon the wall he pulte, Many a Gryffon it byhulte. As greyhoundes stryken out of lese Kynge Rycharde threste amonge the prese. Seuen chaynes with his good swerde Our kynge forcarfe a mydwarde, That were drawen for grete doute Within the gates and without. Porcules and gates vp he wan, And lette come in euery man. Men myght se by strete and lane Frensshe and Gryffons casche here bane. Some to hous ran in haste, Dores and wyndowes barred faste. The Englissh brake them vp with levours, And slewe them with grete vygours. All that they founde ayenst them stande, Passed thorough dethes hande. They brake cofers, and toke tresours, Golde, and syluer, and couertours, Jeweles, stones, and spycery, All that they founde in tresoury. There was none of Englysshe blode That he ne had as moche gode As they wolde drawe or bere To shyppe or to pauylyons, i swere. And euer cryed Kynge Rycharde: “Slee downe righte the Frensshe cowarde, And ken them in batayl That ye haue no tayl.” The Kynge of Fraunce came pryckynge Ayenst Rycharde our kynge, And fell on knees downe of his hors, And bad mercy, for Goddes corps; For the crowne, and for the loue Of Jhesu Cryste, kynge aboue, And for the vyage, and for the crose, He sholde be in gree, and take lose; And he wolde on honde take, They sholde amende all the wrake That they had hym or his Ony thynge done amys. Kynge Rycharde had grete pyte Of the Kynge of Fraunce that sat on kne, And lyght adowne, so sayth the boke, And in his armes vp hym toke, And sayd, it sholde be peas and styll, And yelde the towne all to his wyll; And bad hym nought greue hym tho, Though he had venged hym of his fo That had his good knyghtes quelde, And eke on hym despyte itelde. The Kynge of Fraunce bigan to preche, And bad Rycharde be his soule leche, And the tresoure yelde agayne than That he had take of euery man, And elles he ne myght, in Goddes paye, To Jherusalem take the waye. Kyng Rycharde sayd: “With thy tresoure Thou myght nought amende the dyshonoure That they haue done me or this. And, Syr, also thou dyde amys Whan thou sentest to Tanker the kynge To appayre me with thy lesynge. We haue to Jherusalem the waye sworne, Who breketh our pylgrymage, he is forlorne, Or who so maketh ony medlaye Betwene vs two in this waye.” Whan abbated was that dystaunce, There came two justyces of Fraunce Upon two stedes ryde, And Kynge Rycharde they gan chyde. That one was hyght Margaryte, That other Syr Hewe Impetyte. Swythe sore they hym trayde, Cleped hym taylarde, and hym myssayde. Kynge Rycharde helde a tronchon tewe, And to them two he hym drewe; Sir Margaryte he gaue a dente than Aboue the eye vpon the pan; The skull braste with that dente, The ryght eye flewe out quytemente, And he fell downe deed in haste. Hewe of Impetyte was agaste, And prycked away withouten fayle, And Rycharde was soone at his tayle, And gaue hym a stroke on the molde, That deed he thought be he sholde. Ternes and quernes he gaue hym there, And sayd: “Syr, thus thou shalte lere To myssaye thy ouerhedlynge! Go playne now to your Frensshe kynge!” An erchebisshop came full soone, He fell on knees, and badde a bone. Of Kynge Richarde he asked mercy, That he wolde þer sesy, And there no more harme do For Goddes loue the people to. Kyng Rycharde graunted hym then, And drewe to pauylyon all his men. To this daye men may here speke How the Englysshe were there awreke. All the whyle that they were there, They myght well bye theyr chafere; There was none so hardy a man That one euyll worde speke gan. Kynge Rycharde in peas and reste Fro Crystmasse, that hygh feste, Dwelled there tyll after the Lente, And than on his waye he wente. In Marche moneth the Kynge of Fraunce Wente to shyppe without dystaunce. Whan he was gone, soone afterwarde, Came the doughty Kynge Rycharde; Forth towarde Acrys wende he wolde, With moche store of syluer and golde. Foure shyppes were charged, j fynde, Towarde Cyprys all saylynde, Charged with tresour euery dell, And soone a sorowfull caas there fell. A grete tempest arose sodaynly, That lasted fyue dayes sykerly. It brake theyr maste, and theyr ore, And theyr takell, lesse and more, Anker, bowesprette, and rother Ropes, cordes, one and other; And were in poynt to synke adowne As they came ayenst the Lymosowne. And thre shyppes ryght anone All tobrake ayenst the stone; All to peces they totare, Unnethe the folke saued ware. Þe ferde schippe byhynde duellede, Vnnethes the maryners it helde; And þat schippe lefte righte in þe depe, Þat þe folkes one þe lande myghte wepe: For the Gryffons, with short wordes, Come with axes and with swerdes, Grete slaughter of our Englyssh maked, And spoyled the quycke all naked: Syxtene hondred they brought of lyue, And into pryson hondredes fyue, And also naked syxty score As they were of theyr moders bore: Of the shyppes brekynge they were blythe; The justyces of Cyprys ran full swythe, And drewe vp cofers manyfolde, Full of syluer and of golde, Dysshes, cuppes, broches, and rynges, Ffull gud jewells, and ryche thynges: No man, by south ne by north, Ne coude account what it was worth; And all was borne that tresour, Wheder that wolde the emperour The thyrde daye afterwarde A wynde came dryuynge Kynge Rycharde, With all his grete nauyes, And his saylynge galyes To the shyppe that stode in depe. The gentyl men therin dyde wepe, And when they sawe Rycharde the kynge, Theyr wepynge tourned all to laughynge. They welcomed hym with worshyppes, And tolde hym the brekynge of theyr shyppes, And the robbery of his tresoure, And all that other dyshonoure. Than waxed Kynge Rycharde full wrothe, And he swore a full grete othe, By Jhesu Cryste, our sauyoure, It sholde abye the emperoure. He cleped Syr Steuen, and Wyllyam, And also Roberte of Turnam, Thre gentyll barons of Englonde, Wyse of speche, doughty of honde: “Now go, and saye to the emperoure, That he yelde agayne my tresoure, Or, j hym swere by Saynt Denys, I wyll haue thre syth double of his; And yelde my men out of pryson, And for the deed paye raunson, And ?elde agayne my robery, Or hastily he schall aby! Bothe with spere and with launce Anone j shall take vengaunce.” The messengers anone forth wente To do theyr lordes commaundement, And hendly sayd theyr message. The emperoure began to rage, He grunte his tethe, and faste blewe, A knyfe after Syr Roberte he threwe. He blente awaye with a lepe, And it flewe in a dore a span depe; And syth he cryed, as vncourteys: “Out, taylardes, of my paleys! Now go, and saye your tayled kynge That j owe hym no thynge! I am full gladde of his lore, I wyll hym yelde none other answore, And he shall fynde me to morowe At the hauen to do hym sorowe, And werke hym as moche wrake, As his men that j haue take.” The messengers wente out full swythe, Of theyr ascapynge they were blythe. The emperours stewarde with honoure Sayde thus vnto the emperoure: “Syr,” he sayd, “thou hast vnryght! Thou haddest almoost slayne a knyght That is messenger vnto a kynge, The best vnder the sonne shynynge. Thou hast thyselfe tresour enoghe, ?elde hym his, or þou getis grete woghe: For he is crossed, and pylgrym, And all his men that ben with hym. Lette hym do his pylgrymage, And kepe thyselfe frome domage!” The eyen twynkled of the emperoure, And smyled as a vile traytoure; His knyfe he drewe out of his shethe Therwith to do the steward scathe, And called hym withouten fayle, And sayd he wolde telle hym a counsayle. The stewarde on knees hym set adowne With the emperour for to rowne, And the emperour of euyll truste Carued off his nose by the gruste, And sayd: “Traytour, thefe, stewarde, Go playne the to þe Englysshe taylarde! And yf he come on my londe, I shall hym do suche a shonde, And all his men quycke slayne, But he in haste tourne agayne!” The stewarde his nose hente (Iwys his vysage was jshente), Quickely out of the castell ran, Leue he ne toke of no man. The messengers mercy he cryed, For Maryes loue, in that tyde, They sholde tell to theyr lorde Of the dyshonour ende and worde: “And haste you agayne to londe, And j shall sese into your honde The keyes of euery toure That oweth that fals emperoure; And j shall brynge hym this nyght The emperours doughter bryght, And also an hondred knyghtes, Stoute in armes, stronge in fyghtes, Ayenst that fals emperoure, That hath done me this dyshonoure.” The messengers them hyed harde Tyll they came to Kynge Rycharde. They founde Kynge Rycharde playe At the chesse in his galaye; The Erle of Rychemonde with hym played, And Rycharde wan all that he layed. The messengers tolde all the dyshonour That them dyde the emperour; And the despyte he dyde his stewarde In despyte of Kynge Rycharde, And the stewarde presentynge His byhest, and his helpyng. Than answered Kynge Rycharde, In dede lyon, in thought lybarde: “Of your sawes j am blythe! Anone set vs to londe swythe!” A grete crye arose fote hote, Out was shotte many a bote; The bowe-man, and eke the arblasters, Armed them at all auenters, And shotte quarelles, and eke flone, As thycke as the hayle-stone. The folke of the cite gan renne, And were fayne to voyde and fle thenne. The barons and good knyghtes After came anone ryghtes, With theyr lorde Kynge Rycharde, That neuer was founde no cowarde. Kyng Rychard, as j vnderstonde, Or he wente out of Englonde, Let hym make an axe, for the nones, To breke therwith the Sarasyns bones. The heed was wrought ryght wele, Therin was twenty pounde of stele; And whan he came into Cyprys-londe, The axe he toke in his honde, All that he hytte he all tofrapped; The Gryffons awaye faste rapped; Neuertheles many one he cleued, And theyr vnthonkes ther byleued. And the pryson whan he came to, With his axe he smote ryght tho, Dores, barres, and jren chaynes, And delyuered his men out of paynes. He let them all delyuer cloth, For theyr despyte he was wroth, And swore by Jhesu, our sauyoure, He sholde abye, that fals emperoure. All the burgeyses of the towne Kynge Rycharde let slee without raunsowne, Theyr tresour, and theyr iueles He toke to his owne cateles. Tydynges came to the emperour, Kynge Rycharde was in Lymasour, And had his burgeyses to deth jdo: No wonder though hym were wo. He sente anone without fayle After all his counsayle, That they came to hym on hye To wreke hym of his enemye. His hoost was come by mydnyght, And redy on the morowe for to fyght. Hearken now of the stewarde! He came at nyght to Kynge Rycharde, The emperours doughter he brought hym with, And grette Kynge Rycharde in pease and gryth. He fell on knees, and gan to wepe, And sayd: “Kynge Rycharde, God the kepe! Loo, how j am shente for the! Gentyl lord, awreke thou me! The emperours doughter bryght I the betake, gentyll knyght. The keyes also j betake the here Of euery castell in his powere. An hondred knyghtes j you behyght, Lo them here redy in all ryght; That shall you lede and socoure Ayenst that fals emperoure! Thou shalte be bothe lorde and syre Or tomorowe of his empyre. And, swete syr, withouten fayle, Yet the behoueth my counsayle: I shall the lede by a coost Pryuely vpon his hoost; In his pauylyon ye shall hym take; Than thynke vpon the moche wrake That he hath done the or this! Though ye hym slee, no force it is!” Moche thanked Kynge Rycharde Of the counseyll the stewarde, And swore by God, our sauyoure, His nose sholde be bought well soure. Ten hondred stedes good and sure Kyng Rycharde let araye in trappure, On eueryche lepte an Englysshe knyght, Stowte in armes, and stronge in fighte. And also the stewarde, applyght, Ladde them by the mone lyght So nygh the emperours pauylyowne, That of the trumpettes he herde the sowne. It was before the dawnynge, The steward sayd to Rycharde the kynge: “Lette se, Rycharde, assayle yerne The pauylyon with the golden herne; Therin lyeth the emperour: Awreke now this dyshonour!” Than was Rycharde fresshe to fyght As euer was fawkon to the flyght, He prycked forth vpon his stede, Hym folowed full grete ferrede. His axe he helde in honde jdrawe, Many a Gryffon he hath jslawe. The waytes of that hoost that dyde aspye, And full loude began they for to crye: “We ben betrayed and jnome! As armes, lordes, all and some! In euyll tyme our emperour Robbed Kynge Rycharde of his tresour, For he is here amonge vs, And sleeth downe ryght, by Jhesus!” The Englysshe knyghtes, for the nones, To hewed the Gryffons bodyes and bones. They smote the cordes, and felled downe Many a ryche pauylyowne; And euer cryed squyer and knyght: “Smyte! Lay on! Slee downe ryght! Yelde the tresour ayenwarde That ye toke from Kynge Rycharde. Ye ben worthy to haue suche mede, With grymly woundes to lye and blede!” At the emperours pauylyon Kynge Rycharde Alyght, so dyde the stewarde; And the emperour was fledde awaye, Himselfe alone, or it was daye. Flowen was that fals coward, Narowe hym sought Kynge Richarde. He fand his clothis and his tresoure, Bot he was fled, þat vile traytoure. Longe or the daye began to dawe, Twenty thousande Gryffons were jslawe. Of sylke, sendele, and syclaton Was the emperours pauylyon: In the worlde ne was none syche, Ne by moche thynge so ryche. Kynge Rycharde, wiþ grete worshyp, Bad they sholde be lad to shyp: Suche at Acrys was there none founde, Pauylyoun of so moche mounde. Cuppes of golde, grete and smale, He wan there without tale; Many cofres, small and grete, He founde there full jbete. Two stedes founde the Kynge Rycharde, That one hyght Fauell, that other Lyarde: In the worlde was not theyr pere; Dromedary, nor destrere, Stede rabyte, ne camayle That ran so swyfte without fayle; For a thousande pounde jtolde Sholde not that one be solde. All that his men before had lore, Seuen double they had therfore. Tydynges to the emperour was come That his doughter was jnome, And how that his hygh-steward Her had delyuered to Kynge Rycharde. By that he wyst well, jwys, That he had done amys. Two messengers he clyped anone, And bad them to Kynge Rycharde gone, And saye, your emperour and your kynge, That j hym sende Goddes gretynge; Homage by yere j wyll hym gyue and yelde, And all my londe of hym helde, So that he wyll, for charyte, In peas hereafter let me be. The messengers anone forth wente To do theyr lordes commaundemente. Kynge Rycharde answered therto: “I graunte lordynges that it be so. Go and saye your emperour, That he dyde grete dyshonour, Whan he robbed pylgrymes That were towarde the paynymes. Let hym yelde my tresour euery dele, Yf he wyll be my specyele; And also saye your emperour That he amende that dyshonour That he dyde to his stewarde In despyte of Kynge Rycharde; And that he come erly tomorowe, And crye me mercy with grete sorowe, Homage by yere me yeld or bere, And elles, by my crowne j swere, He shall not haue a fote of londe Neuer more out of my honde.” The messengers by one accorde Tolde this the emperour theyr lorde. Than the emperour was full wo That he this dede sholde do. To Kynge Rycharde he came on the morowe, In his herte was moche sorowe. He fell on knees, so sayth the boke, Kyng Rycharde by bothe the fete he toke, And cryed mercy with good entent; And he forgaue hym his maltalent. Fewte he dyde hym and homage Before all his baronage. That daye they were at one accorde, And in same dyde ete at one borde; Jn grete solace, and moche playe. Togyder they were all that daye. And whan it drewe towarde the eue, The emperour toke his leue, And wente towarde his hostell; In herte hym was nothynge well. He helde hymselfe a foule cowarde, That he dyde homage to Kynge Rycharde, And thought how he hym awreke myght. Forth he rode anon ryght To a cyte that hyght Bonevent, He came by daye verament. There he founde many a grete syre, The rychest men of his empyre. To them playned the emperour Of the shame and of the dyshonour That hym dyde Kynge Rycharde, Thorugh the helpe of his stewarde. Up there stode a noble barowne, Ryche of castell and of towne, The stewardes eme he was That the emperour had shente his fas. “Syr,” he sayd, “thou arte mystaught, Thou arte all aboute naught; Without encheson and jugement Thy goode stewarde thou haste jshent, That sholde, as he well couthe, Us haue holpe and saued nouthe! Thorugh thy wyll malycyous Ryght so thou woldest serue vs. And j saye the with wordes bolde: With suche a lorde kepe j not holde To fyght ayenst Rycharde the kynge, The best vnder the sonne shynynge, Ne none of all my baronage Ne shall the neuer do homage. All the other sayd at one worde That Rycharde was theyr kynde lorde, And the emperour for hys vylanye Was well worthy for to dye. The emperour sawe and vnderstode That his barons wolde hym no gode: To another towne he wente, and helde hym thare; In his herte was moche care. That same tyme the hygh-stewarde Counseylled with Kynge Rycharde, And sayd that hym forthought full sore That the emperour was so forlore. They soughte hym in all wyse, And founde hym in the cyte of Pyse; And certaynly Kyng Rycharde Wolde no loke to hym ward, For he had broken his treuth, Kyng Rychard had of hym no reuth; But let a sergeaunt hym bynde Bothe his hondes soone hym behynde, And caste hym into a galey, And ledde hym into Surrey, And swore by hym that made mone and sterre, Ayenst the Sarasynes he sholde werre. Whan all this warre abated was, Kyng Rycharde set that londe in peas. The Erle of Leycestre, full truly, Thorugh conseyl of his barony, He made hym stewarde of that londe, And bitoke the realme to his honde; Grete feest he helde afterwarde. His shyppes let dyght Kynge Rycharde, Forth towarde Acrys he wolde, With moche store of syluer and golde; With two hondred shyppes j fynde Saylynge forwarde with the wynde, And afterwarde fyfty galyes For to warde his nauyes. And as the doughty Kynge Rycharde Came saylynge to Acrys warde, And had sayled with wynde at wyll Ten dayes fayre and styll, Þe vnleuenþe day þay saylyd in tempest; Þat ny?t ne day hadde þey no rest. And as þey were in gret auenture, Þey saw? a drowmound, out of mesure; Þe drowmound was so heuy ffrau?t, Þat vneþe my?t it sayle au?t. It was toward þe Sarezynys, Chargyd wiþ corn, and wiþ wynys, Wiþ wylde ffyr and oþer vytayle. Kyng R. say? þe drowmound, saun faile, He callyd in haste Aleyn Trenchemer, And bad hym to wende hem neer, And aske whens þat þey ware, And what þey hadde in chaffare? Aleyn quyk, and men jnowe To þat drowmound begunne to rowe, And askyd wiþ whom þat þey ware, And what þey hadden in chaffare. Anon stood vp here latynier, And answeryd Aleyn Trenchemer: “Wiþ þe Kyng off Ffraunce, saun faile; Ffro Poyl we brynge þis vytaile. A moniþ we hauen leyen in þe see, Toward Acres wolde wee.” “Wynde vp sayl,” quod Aleyn, “swyþe, And sayle we forþ wiþ wyndes lyþe!” “Nay! be Seynt Thomas off Ynde, Vs moste nedes come behynde! Ffor we ben so heuy ffrau?t, Vneþis may we saylen au?t.” Þenne sayde Alayn sone anon: “I here off ?ow speke but on; Let stande vp alle in ffere, Þat we now my?te moo here, And knowe ?oure tungge afftyr þan; Ffor we wole nou?t leue oo man.” “Sertes,” quod þe latyniere, “Wiþ no moo men spekys þou here. Þey were to ny?t in tempeste; Þey lyggen alle, and taken here reste.” “Sertes,” sayde þenne goode Aleyn, “To Kyng Rychard j wole seyn That ?e aren alle Sarezynes, Chargyd wiþ cornes and wiþ wynes!” Þe Sarezynes sterten vp al preste, And sayden: “Ffelawe! goo, doo þy beste! Ffor Kyng R. and hys galyes We wolde nou?t geue twoo fflyes!” Þo Trenchemer gan rowen hard Tyl he come to Kyng Richard, And swor to hym be Seynt Ihon Þat þey were Sarezynes euerylkon. Þenne sayde oure kyng off renoun Þat hy?te Richard Coer de Lyoun: “Off ?oure sawes j am blyþe; Lat see arme ?ow now swyþe! Stere þou my galye, Trenchemer, I wole asaye þat pawtener. Wiþ myn ax j schal hem ffrape, Þer schal no Sarezyn me ascape!” Als tyte hys ax was to hym brou?t, His oþir armure fforgat he nou?t. To hym comen maryners jnowe. Kyng Richard bad hem faste rowe: “Rowes on faste! who þat is ffeynt, In euel water moot he be dreynt!” Þey roweden harde, and layde to, And songe: Heuelow, rummeloo! The galeye wente alsoo fast, As quarel dos out off þe arweblast; And as þe drowmund come wiþ þe wynd A large quarter out behynde, Þe galey rente wiþ þe bronde Jnto þe see, j vndyrstonde. Þenne were þe Sarezynys armyd wel, Boþe in yryn and in steel; And stood on borde, and fou?ten hard Agayn þe dou?ty Kyng Richard; And Kyng Richard, and his kny?tes, Slowe þe Sarezynes doun ry?tes; And as þey gunne to wyrke hem woo, Euere þer stood vp moo and moo; And rappyd on hem, for þe nones, Sterne strokes wiþ harde stones Out off þe topcastel on hy?, Þat Richard was neuere his deþ so ny?. Þenne comen seuene galyes behynde To þe drownound quyk saylynde, And stood on borde baroun and kny?t To helpe Kyng Richard ffor to ffy?t. A strong batayle þere began Betwene hem and þe heþene men, Wiþ swerdes, speres, dartes kene; Flones and quarelles ffley? betwene Also þykke, wiþouten stynt, As hayl afftyr þondyr-dynt. And in þe bykyr, þat was so hard, Into þe drowmound come Kyng Richard. Whenne he was comen in on haste, He dressyd hys bak vnto þe maste. Wiþ his ax, þat he ouyrrau?te, Hastely hys deþ he cau?te. Some he hytte on þe bacyn, Þat he cleff hym to þe chyn; And some to þe gyrdyl-stede, And some vnto þe schyppes brede; Some in þe hals so hytte hee, Þat helme and hed ffley? into þe see: Ffor non armour wiþstood hys ax, No more þan a knyff dos þe wax. Þe Sarezynes, as j ?ow telle, Sayde he was a deuyl off helle; And ouyr þe bord lopen he, And drownyd hemself in þe see. Syxtene hundryd be aquelde, But þrytty Sarezynes þe kyng leet held, Þat þey scholden bere wytnes Off þis batayle at Acres. Þe kyng ffond in þe drowmound, sauns fayle, Mekyl stor, and gret vytayle, Many barel off ffyr Gregeys, And many a þousand bowe Turkeys, Hokyd arewes, and quarelles. Þey fond þere ful manye barelles, And off whete gret plente, Gold and syluer, and ylke deynte. Off tresour he hadde nou?t half þe mounde Þat in þe drowmound was jffounde: Ffor it drownyd in þe flood Ar halff vnchargyd were þat good. Avaunsyd was al Crystyante, Ffor hadde þe drowmound jpassyd þe see, And comen to Acres ffro Kyng Richard, And hondryd wyntyr afftyrward, Ffor alle Crystene-men vnder sunne, Hadde nou?t Acres ben jwunne! Þus Kyng Richard wan þe drowmound, Þorw? Goddes help, and Seynt Edmound. Kyng Richard aftyr anon ry?t, Toward Acres gan hym dy?t; And as he saylyd toward Surrye, He was warnyd off a spye Hou þe ffolk off þe heþene lawe A gret cheyne hadden jdrawe Ouyr þe hauene off Acres ffers, And was ffestnyd to twoo pelers, Þat no schyp ne scholde in wynne, Ne þey nou?t out þat were wiþinne. Þerfore seuene ?er and more Alle Crystene kynges leyen þore, And wiþ gret hongyr suffryd payne, Ffor lettyng off þat ylke chayne. Kyng Richard herde þat tydynge, Ffor ioye his herte began to sprynge, And swor and sayde in hys þou?t Þat ylke a chayne scholde helpe hem nou?t. A swyþe strong galey he took, And Trenchemer, so says þe book, Steryd þe galey ry?t ffol euene Ry?t in þe myddes off þe hauene. Were þe maryners sau?te or wroþe, He made hem saylle and rowe boþe, That the galey yede also swyfte, As ony foule by the lyfte. And Kyng Richard, þat was so good, Wiþ hys ax in foreschyp stood, And whenne he come to þe cheyne, Wiþ his ax he smot it on twayne, Þat alle þe barouns, verrayment, Sayde it was a noble dent; And ffor ioye of þis dede Þe cuppes faste abouten ?ede, Wiþ good wyn, pyement and clarre; And saylyd toward Acres cyte. Kyng Richard out off hys galye Caste wylde ffyr into þe skye, And ffyr Gregeys into þe see, As al on fyr weren hee. Trumpes ?ede in hys galye,— Men my?ten it here into þe skye,— Taboures and hornes Sarezyneys; Þe see brente all off ffyr Gregeys. Gunnes he hadde on wondyr wyse, Mangneles off gret queyntyse, Arweblast, bowe, made wiþ gynne, Þe Holy Lond ffor to wynne. Ouyr al oþere, wyttyrly, A melle he made, of gret maystry, In myddes a schyp ffor to stande: Swylke on saw? neuere man in lande. Ffoure sayles were þertoo, ?elew, and grene, rede, and bloo, Wiþ caneuas layd wel al aboute, Fful schyr wiþjnne, and eke wiþoute, And al wiþjnne fful off ffeer, Off torches maad wiþ wex ful cleer; Ovyrtwart and endelang Wiþ strenges off wyr þe stones hang; Stones þat deden neuere note, Grounde þey neuere whete no grote, But rubbyd, als þey were wood; Out off þe eye ran red blood; Beffore þe trou? þer stood on, Al in blood he was begon, And hornes grete vpon hys hede, The Sarezynes of hym hadde gret drede, For it was within the nyght They were agrysed of that syght, And sayd he was the deuell of hell That was come them to quell: Ffor þe rubbyng off þe stones, Þey wende it hadde ben mennes bones. A lytyl beffore þe ly?t off day Clenly þey were don away. Kyng Rychard aftyr þat meruayle Wente quik to lond saun fayle. Þe Kyng off Ffraunce agayn hym come, And in hys armes he hym nome, And kyste hym wiþ gret honour, And so dede many an emperour. Alle þe kynges off Crystyante Þat þere hadden longe jbee, And leyn þere seuene ?er in dolour, Resseyuyd King Richard wiþ honour. Þe erchebysschop off Pyse Dede Kyng Richard his seruyse, And ledde hym, as ?e may see, Into a pauyloun in pryuyte, And tolde hym a doolful tale Off schrewede auentures manye and fal(e). “Kyng Richard,” he sayde, “now here! Þis sege has lastyd seuene ?ere. It may nou?t fro þe be holde, Mekyl sorwe haue we þolde! Ffor we ne hadde no castel Þat vs off ony warde ffel; But a wyde dyke, and a depe, We made wiþinne vs for to kepe, Wiþ barbycanes, for þe nones, Hey?e wrou?t off harde stones. And whenne þat oure dyke was ymade, Saladyn þe Sawdon was glade, And come on vs with gret route, And besette vs al aboute; And wiþ hym Markes Manferaunt, Þat leues on Mahoun and Termagaunt: He was a Crystene kyng sum whyle; He dos vs more schame and gyle Þenne þe Sawdon, and al hys hoost. Ffadyr, and Sone, and Holy Gost, Graunte hym grace off worldis schame, Markys Feraunt be hys name! Oure fferste bataylle, sykyrly, Was fful strong and fful deedly. Weel ffou?ten oure Crystene kny?tes, And slowen þe Sarezynes dounry?tes. Oure Crystene hadden þe maystry, Þe Sarezynes fflowe, wiþ woo and cry. We slowe off hem manye þoo, And þey off vs manye alsoo; And j schal telle þorw? what cas It ffyll to many a man allas! As we dede Sarezynys to dede, Beffell þat a noble stede Outrayyd fro a paynym: Oure Crystene-men ffaste folewyd hym. Þe Sarezynes sey?en þat þey come, And ffley? asyde, alle and some; And com on vs wiþ gret ffy?t, And slow? many a Crystene knyght, Þat þere we loste, ar we it wyste, Þe beste bodyes vndyr Criste: Þe Erl off Fferrers off Yngeland, Þer was no dou?tyere man of hand; And þe emperour off Alemayne, And Janyn, the Eerl of Playn Spayne, Onleuene þousand off oure meyne, Þere were slayn wiþouten pyte! Þeroffe was þe Sawdon full glade; On morwe a newe sawt he made. He leet taken alle þe cors, Boþe off dede men, and off hors, And caste into þe watyr off oure welle Vs to poysoun and to quelle; Dede he neuere a wers dede To Crystene-men ffor no nede. For þorw? þat poysoun, and that brethe, Ffourty þousand toke her dethe. Sone afftyr newe ?er, is nou?t to hyde, Þe þrydde caas vs gan betyde. A schyp come saylande in þe see, Chargyd wiþ whete, gret plente, Wiþ wylde ffyr, and armes bry?t, To helpe þe Sarezynes ffor to ffy?t. Þe Crystene token to red, saun ffayle, That þey wolde þe schyp assayle. And so þey dede to oure damage! Þe wynd blew hard wiþ gret rage; Þe Sarazynes drow? vp here sayl, And ouyrsaylyd oure folk, saun fayl, Þat þere we lost syxty score Off þe beste bodyes þat weren jbore! Þis was þe begynnyng of oure care Þat we haue had þis seuene ?are; And ?it, sere kyng, þou schalt here more Þat has greuyd vs fful sore. On Seynt James daye, verrayment, Þe Sarezynes out off Acres went, Weel a myle vs besyde, And py?t pauylouns rounde and wyde, And soiournyd þere a long whyle, And alle it was vs to begyle. Oure Crystene-men, þat were wy?t, Erl, baroun, squyer, and kny?t, Sey?en þe Sarezynes haue ryhchesse, And we of alle good dystresse, And þou?te to wynne to oure pray Off þat tresore and þat noblay. Ffyffty þousynd hem armyd weel, Boþe in yren and in steel, And wenten fforþ to batayllyng. Þe Sarezynes saw? here comyng, And fflowen asyde swyþe fast, And oure men comen afftyr in haste, And gunnen to ryde wyþ gret raundoune Tyl þey come to here pauyloun. Þey founde þerjnne no fferede, Þey wende þey hadde ben fflowen ffor drede. Þey founden þere whete, bred, and wynes, Gold, and syluyr, and bawdekynes; Vessel of syluyr, coupes off golde, More þenne þey take scholde. Some stood, and some sat doun, And eet, and drank gret ffoysoun; And afftyr mete þe pauylouns newe With theire suerdys doun þay hewe; And chargyd hors wiþ vytayle, As nyse men scholde saun fayle! Gold and sylvyr in males þey pytte, And wiþ here gerdeles þey hem knytte. Whenne þat ylke man hadde his charge, Home þey wolden, wiþouten targe. The Sarezynes sey? wel here wendyng, And comen afftyr ffaste fflyngyng, At schorte wurdes a gret route, And besette oure hoost aboute. Þere here males doun þey caste; Agayn þe Sarezynes þey fou?ten faste. And þere were lost þousandes ffyfftene, Noble men, hardy and kene. Þis caase greuyd vs so sore, Þat we wende haue ben fforlore, But God Almy?ty, heuene kyng, Sente vs sone socouryng: Þe dou?ty Eerl off Champayne, And goode kny?tes off Bretayne, And Randulff þe Glamvyles, And Jhon þe Neel, and his broþer Myles, And Bawdewyn, a clerk fful mery, Þe Erchebisshop of Cauntyrbery; And wiþ hym come hys nevewe, A baroun off gret vertewe, Huberd Gawter off Yngelande, Agayn þe Sarezynes ffor to stande; And manye kny?tes off Hongry, And mekyl oþir cheualry. Þenne heeld we a strong bataylle; But an hard caas vs ffel, saun faylle. At My?hylmasse, it moste be told, Þe wedyr gan to wexe cold. Þan ffel boþe rayn and hayl, And snow? ffyue ffoote deep, saun fa(yle); Þondyr, ly?tnyng, wedyr tow?; Ffor hungyr oure ffolk it slow?; Ffor hungyr we loste, and colde wyndes, Off oure ffolk syxty þousyndes! Þenne oure goode hors we slowe, Dede seþe, and eete þe guttys towe. Þe fflesch was delyd wiþ grete deynte: Þeroffe hadde no man plente. Al to peses we carff þe hede, And on þe coles we gan it brede, Jn watyr we boylyd þe blood: Þat vs þou?te mete fful good! A quarter off whete men vs solde Ffor syxty pound off ffloryns tolde; Ffor ffourty pound men solde an oxe, Þou? it were but lytyl woxe; A swyn ffor an hundryd ffloryn, A goos ffor halff mark off gold ffyn, And ffor an hen, to syke þynges, Men gaff of penyes ffyftene schillinges, And ffor an ay penyes vnleuene, And ffor a pere syxe or seuene, And ffor an appyl penyes sexe: And þus began oure folk vnwexe, And dyede ffor hungyr and ffor woo. Þe ryche men token to rede þoo A ryche dole ffor to dy?te To barouns and to pore kny?te. Twelue penyes men gaf to eueryche, And syxe to oþere þat were nou?t ryche, And ffour to þe smale wy?tes: Þus þe ryche here dole dy?tes. Þerwiþ þe more and þe lasse Bou?te hem fflesch off hors and asse. Þey my?te haue non oþir þyng, Ffor whyt Tourneys, ne ffor sterlyng. I haue þe told, sere kyng, here Off oure folk al þe lere, And þe damage off Acres hoost! But blessyd be the Holy Gost, And Marye þat bar Jhesus, Þat þou art comen among vs! Þorw? þyn help we hopen snelle Þe Sarezynes doun to felle!” Kyng R. wepte wiþ his eyen boþe, And syth he sayde thus forsoþe: “Sere bysshop, bydde þou for vs, Þat my?t vs sende swete Jhesus Hys foos alle to destroye, Þat þey no more vs anoye!” Richard took leue, and leep on stede, And pryckyd out of þat ferred. He rod aboute þe clos dyke Toward Acres, sykyrlyke, Tyl he come to þe hospytale Of Seynt John, as j ffynde in tale. Þere leet he py?te hys pauyloun, And arerede hys Mate-Gryffoun, That was a tree-castel fful ffyn To assaute wiþ many Sarezyn, Þat he my?te into Acres seen; He hadde þryttene schyp fful of been. Whenne þe castel was fframyd wel, Þey sette þerjnne a mangnel, And comaundyd hys men, belyue, To brynge vp many a bee-hyue, And beet on tabours, and trumpes blowe, And sawte the cyte on a þrowe. Kyng Richard into Acres cyte Leet keste þe hyues gret plente. The wheder was hoot in someres tyde, Þe bees bursten out on euery syde, And were anoyyd, and fful off grame; Þey dede þe Sarezynes ful gret schame, Ffor þey hem stungge in þe vysage, Þat alle þey gunne ffor to rage; And hydde hem in a deep selere, Þat non off hem durste come nere; And sayden Kyng Richard was fful ffel, Whenne hys fflyes byten so wel! Anoþir gyn Kyng Richard vp sette Þat was callyd Robynette; A strong gyn, ffor þe nones, And caste into Acres harde stones. Kyng Richard, þe conquerour, Callyd in haste hys mynour, And bad hym myne vp to þe tour Þat is callyd Maudyt Colour; And swoor hys oþ be Seynt Symoun, But ?iff it were jbrou?t adoun Be noon, and þe vttermeste wal, He scholde hym hewe to peses smal. Þe mynours gunne to myne ffaste; Þe gynours ben and stones caste; Þe Sarezynes hem armyd alle, And runne in haste vnto þe walle. In whyte schetys þey gunne hem wryen Ffor þe bytyng off hys fflyen, And sayde: “Þis man dos vs strong pyne, Whenne he wole boþe þrowe and myne. We saw? neuer kyng so begynne: It is gret doute he schal vs wynne!” Kyng Richard stood in his Mate-Griffoun, And saw? here dedes in þe toun: Whydyrward the Sarazenes flowen, And archers arowes to hem drowen, And arweblasters wiþ quarell smerte, Þorw? legges and armes, hed and herte. Þe Frenssche-men wiþ gret noblay Halp to myne þat ylke day. Þat outemeste wal was doun caste, And many a Sarezyn slayn in haste. Þat day Kyng Richard spedde so þor, Þat he was holden a conqueror: Ffor betere he spedde þat day or noon Þene þe oþere in þe seuene ?er hadde don. The Sarezynes my?ten nou?t dour, Þey flowen into þe hey?e tour; And ly?ten torches abouten þe wal, Men my?te it sen ouyr al. Þe torchys caste a gret ly?t, Þat betokenyd a newe ffy?t Þat was comen ffro Yngelonde, Where þorw? þey my?te nou?t wiþstonde, But ?yff Saladyn, þe Sawdan, Come to helpe wiþ many a man. Saladyn was ten myle þenne, And sey? þe torches ly?tly brene. He gaderede his folk togedere, As þykke as rayn falles in wedere. Þey assemblyd on a playn, Besyde Acres, on a mountayn; Syxty þousand ffootmen j ffynde. Knehches off hay he made hem bynde, To goo before hastelyke For to ffylle þe Crystene dyke. Soo þey haue taken here red To doo þe Crystene-men to ded. Afftyr comen barouns and kny?tes, An hundryd þousand stronge in fy?tes. Be ordre þey comen in here maners, Off red sendel were here baners, Wiþ þree gryffouns depayntyd weel, And off asure a ffayr bendel. Sone þerafftyr come rydande as fele Off bold barouns, by gentyl stele. Here gonfanouns and here penseles Were weel wrou?t off grene sendeles, And on euerylkon a dragoun As he ffau?t wiþ a lyoun. Þe ffyrste were rede, and þyse were grene; Þenne come þe þrydde bataylle bedene: Ffyue and syxty þousand kny?tes, In Ynde armyd to alle ry?tes. Afftyr come, whyte as þe snowe, Ffyffty þousand in a rowe, Þer among was Saladyn, And hys nevewe Myrayn-Momelyn. Here baner whyt wiþouten fable, Wiþ þre Sarezynes-hedes off sable Þat were schapen noble and large; Off balayn boþe scheeld and targe; No man cowde telle þe route, Þey besette þe Crystene al aboute. Þe ffootmen kast in knehches off hay To make þe horsmen in redy way, And ffylde þe dyke ffull vpry?te, Þat al þe hoost wel entre jn my?te. Þe Sarezynys hadden entryd negh, But God almy?ty þertoo segh. Þe cry aros into þe Crystene hoost: “Suse Seynours, has armes tost! But we haue þe betere socour, We beþ fforlore be Seynt Sauour!” Þo my?te men see many wy?t man Hastely to hys armes ran; And wenten quykly to þe dyke, And deffendyd hem hastelyke. Þere was many gentyl heued Quykly ffro þe body weued; Scheldes manye schorn in twoo, And many stede strykyd alsoo; Manye a kny?te þere loste his armes, And manye a stede drow? his harmes; And manye a dou?ty man, saun ffayle, Þere was slayn in þat bataylle. Kyng Rychard was syke þoo, Al Crystyndom to mekyl woo! He my?te hym nou?t of hys bed stere, Þou? his pauyloune hadde be on ffere. Þerfore þe kyng off Fraunce leet crye Among þe Crystene cumpanye Þat no man scholde, ffor dedes doute, Passe þe close dyke wiþoute, But holde them all it within, That the Sarasynes sholde them not wyn. And þoo þat were jn jcomen Off þe Sarezynes þat were jnomen, Ffol hastyly were þey don to dede: For them ?ede no raunsoun to mede. Why Kyng Richard so syke lay, Þe resoun j ?ow telle may: Ffor þe trauaylle off þe see, And strong eyr off þat cuntree, And vnkynde cold and hete, And mete and drynk þat is nou?t sete To hys body, þat he þere ffonde, As he dede here in Yngelonde. Kyng Rychard bad hys men seche Ffor some wys clerk and sertayn leche, Crystyn, oþir Sarezyn Ffor to loken hys vryn. And euery man sayde hys avys, But þer was no man so wys Þat my?te don his sorwe sese, Ne off hys paynes hym relese. Sory were þe ffolk Englysch, Ffor here lord laye in grete anguysch; So was þe Crystene hoost eke, Ffor Rychard lay so sore seke. On knees prayden þe Cristene hoost To Ffadyr, and Sone, and Holy Goost, Be ny?t and day wiþ good entent: “Geue Kyng Richard amendement!” Ffor loue of his modyr dere, Here sone grauntyd her prayere. Þorw? hys grace and his vertu, He turnyd out off hys agu. To mete hadde he no sauour, To wyn, ne watyr, ne no lycour; But afftyr pork he was alongyd. But, þou? his men scholde be hongyd, Þey ne my?te, in þat cuntree, Ffor gold, ne syluer, ne no mone, No pork ffynde, take, ne gete, Þat Kyng Richard my?te ou?t of eete. An old kny?t was wiþ Richard kyng; Whenne he wyste off þat tydyng, Þat þe kynges maners were swyche, To þe styward he spak, priuylyche: “Oure lord kyng sore is syke jwis, Afftyr pork he alongyd is, And ?e may non ffynde to selle: No man be hardy hym so to telle! ?yff ?e dede he my?te deye! ?ow behoues to don als j schal seye, Þat he wete nou?t off þat. Takes a Sarezyn ?onge and ffat; Jn haste þat þe þeff be slayn, Openyd, and hys hyde off fflayn, And soden fful hastyly, Wiþ powdyr, and wiþ spysory, And wiþ saffron off good colour. When þe kyng feles þer off sauour, Out off agu ?yff he be went, He schal haue þertoo good talent. Whenne he has a good tast, And eeten weel a good repast, And soupyd off þe broweys a sope, Slept afftyr, and swet a drope, Þorw? Goddes my?t, and my counsayl, Sone he schal be ffresch and hayl.” Þe soþe to saye at wurdes ffewe, Slayn and soden was þe heþene schrewe; Beffore þe kyng it was forþ brou?t. Quod hys men: “Lord, we haue pork sou?t; Etes, and soupes off þe broweys swote, Þorw? grace off God it schal be ?oure boote.” Beffore Kyng Rychard karf a kny?te, He eete ffastere þan he karue my?te. Þe kyng eet þe fflesch, and gnew þe bones, And drank wel afftyr, for þe nones: And whenne he hadde eeten jnow?, Hys ffolk hem tournyd away and low?. He lay stylle, and drow? in hys arme; Hys chaumbyrlayn hym wrappyd warme. He lay, and slepte, and swette a stounde, And become hool and sounde. Kyng Richard cladde hym, and aros, And walkyd abouten in þe clos; To alle folk he hym schewyd, Glad was boþe leryd and lewyd, And þankyd Ihesu and Marye, Þat he was out off his maladye. Þe Sarezynes spedde day and ny?t Þe dyke to wynne wiþ al here my?t. Þe barbycanes þey ffelden adoun, And hadden ny? enteryd in þe comoun. Whenne Kyng Richard þeroff herde, As a wood man he spak and fferde: “Armes me in myn armure, Ffor loue off Cryst oure creature! To ffy?te j haue gret delyte Wiþ houndes þat wil vs do despyte. Now j me fynde hool and ly?t, Þis day schal j proue my my?t; ?iff j be strong as j was wone, And ?iff j strokes dele cone, As j was wunt in Yngeland. Haue j myn ax in myn hand, Al þat j mete schal me ffele, And swylk dole j schal hem dele, Þat euere for loue off here Mahoun Þey schole haue here warysoun.” He was armyd to alle ry?tes; And hys ffoote-men, squyers, and kny?tes, And þe Crystene alle bedene: Wondyr was þat hoost to sene. Þe soþe to say and nou?t to hele, Þe heþene were twoo so ffele. Before wente his Templers, His Gascoynes, and his Ospytalers; Oure kyng among þe Sarezynes ryt, And some to þe sadyl he slyt; A kyng he hytte aboue þe scheeld, Þat helm and hed ffley? into þe ffeeld. Anoþer he has a strok jbrou?t, Þat al hys armure halp hym nou?t. Into þe sadyl he cleff þe fferþe, Al þat he smot it ffley? to þe erþe. Blyþe was þe Crystene felawrede, Off Kyng Richard, and off hys dede; Ffor non armour wiþstood hys ax, No more þan a knyff dos þe wax. Whenne the Sawdon sey? hym so strong, He sayde þe deuyl was hem among, Ffor Kyng R. ry?t doun slow?. Wiþ al hys hoost he hym wiþdrow?, And ffley? quyk wiþ hys barounnage Into a toun men calles Gage. But sertes, alle þe rerewarde Was jslayn wiþ Kyng Rycharde. Þe Sarezynys þat in Acres ware, Were anoyyd, and fful off care, Whenne þey sey?en þe Sawdon fflee, And Kyng Richard dounry?t slee. Þus al þe day tyl it was ny?t, Þey and þe Crystene heeld þe ffy?t. At euene whenne þe sunne was set, Euery man drow? to hys recet. Þe Crystene, boþe pore and ryche, Wente wiþjnne þe clos dyche, To reste, ffor þey were wery. Kyng Richard leet make a cry Trusty ffolk þat ny?t þe paleys to kepe Whyl that oþere lay and slepe. Þe Sarezynes þat were wiþouten, Off Kyng Richard so sore hem doute(n), Ffor he hadde þe prys jwunne; Away þay ryde, and swyþe runne, Þat ny?t to ffle and to hyde, Þat nonn of hem durste hym abyde, Þe mountenaunce off ten myle. When Kyng Richard hadde restyd a whyle, A kny?t hys armes gan vnlace. Hym to counfforte and solace, Hym was brou?t a sop in wyn: “Þe hed off þat ylke swyn Þat j off eet,”—þe cook he bad,— “Ffor feble j am, and feynt, and mad. Off myn euyl now j am ffere; Serue me þerwiþ at my sopere!” Quod þe cook: “at hed j ne haue.” Þenne sayde þe kyng: “So God me saue, But j see þe hed off þat swyn, Fforsoþe, þou schalt lese þyn!” Þe cook sey? non oþir may bee, He ffette þe hed, and leet hym see, He ffel on knees, and made a cry: “Loo here þe hed! my lord, mercy!” Hys swarte vys whenne þe kyng seeþ, Hys blacke berd, and hys whyte teeþ, Hou hys lyppys grennyd wyde: “What deuyl is þis?” þe kyng cryde, And gan to lau?e as he were wood. “What, is Sarezynys flesch þus good? And neuere erst j nou?t wyste? By Goddys deþ and hys vpryste, Schole we neuere dye for defawte, Whyl we may in any assawte Slee Sarezynys, þe flesch mowe take, Seþen, and roste hem, and doo hem bake, Gnawen here fflesch to þe bones. Now j haue it prouyd ones, Ffor hungyr ar j be woo, J and my ffolk schole eete moo!” On þe morwe, wiþouten ffayle, Þe cyte þey gunne ffor to assayle. Þe Sarezynes my?te nou?t endour, Þey ffledde into þe hey?e tour, And cryede trewes and parlement, To Kyng Richard, þat was so gent, And alsoo to þe Kyng off Ffraunce, And bad mercy wiþoff here dystaunse. Anon stood vp here latynier, And cryede lowde wiþ voys cler: “Heris,” he sayde, “gentyl lordynges, I ?ow brynge goode tydynges Þat Saladyn ?ow sent by me! He wole þat Acres ?olde bee, And Ierusalem into ?oure hand, And off Surry al þe land, To fflume Jordan þe water clere, Ffor ten þousand besauntes be ?ere, And ?yff þat ?e wole nou?t soo, ?e schole haue pes ffor eueremoo, So þat ?e make kyng off Surry Markes Feraunt, off gret maystry; Ffor he is strengeste man, jwis, Off Crystyndom or off Heþenys.” Þenne answeryd Kyng Richard: “Þou lyes,” he sayde, “ffyle coward! Jn ylke gaderyng, and in ylke pres Markes is fals traytour, and les. He has whytyd Saladynys hand To be kyng off Surrye-land, And, be þe kyng in trynyte, Þat traytour schal it neuere bee! He was Crystene be my fadyr day, And siþþen he has renayyd his lay, And is becomen a Sarezyn: Þat God geue hym wol euele ffyn! He is wurs þan an hound! He robbyd syxty þousand pound, Out off þe Hospytelers hand, Þat my ffadyr sente into þis land, Þat was callyd Kyng Henry, Crystene men to gouerny. I hote hym goo out off þis hoost! Ffor j swere be þe Holy Gost, And be Marye þat bar Ihesus: Ffynde j that traytour among vs, Oþer be ny?t, oþer be dawe, Wiþ wylde hors he schal be drawe.” Þenne answeryd þe Kyng off Ffraunce To Kyng Richard wiþouten destaunce: “A suffre, Sere, bele amys, Þou hast wrong, Sere, be Seynt Denys, Þat þou þretyst þat markys Þat þe neuere ?it dede amis. ?yff he haue ony þyng don ylle, He schal amende it at þy wylle. I am hys borw?: loo, here þe gloue! Tak it, leue Sere, ffor my loue!” “Nay,” quod R., “be God, my lord, Ne schal j neuere wiþ hym acord! Ne hadde neuere be lost Acres toun, Ne hadde ben þorw? hys tresoun. ?yff he ?elde agayn my faderis tresour, And Ierusalem wiþ gret honour: Þenne my wraþþe j hym forgeue, And neuere ellys whyl þat j leue.” The Kyng of Fraunce was woo þerfore, But he durste speke no more, Ffor euere he dredde off dentys hard To vnderfonge off Kynge Richard. And whenne þe latynier herde þis, Þat kyng my?t nou?t be þe markys: “Heres,” he sayde, “goode lordynges, I ?ow brynge oþir tydynges Þat mekyl more is to ?oure wylle: Þat oure folk may passe stylle, Wiþ lyff and leme, hand and arme, Without dente and without harme; And we wole ?elde ?ow þis toun, And þe holy croys wiþ gret renoun, And syxty þousand presons þertoo, And an hundrid þousand besauntes and moo. And haue ?e schole alsoo herjnne Ryche tresore, and mekyl wynne; Helmes and hawberkes syxty þousynd(e), And oþer ryhchesse ?e may ffynde; Whete jnow? and oþir tresore, To al ?oure hoost seuene ?er and more; And ?iff ?e wole nou?t þis ffonge, We may kepe ?ow out fful longe, And euere to ffynde on off oures Ffor to slen ten off ?oures. Ffor we haue herjnne, wiþouten fabl(e), Syxty þousand men fensable; And we praye, for þe loue of God, That ?e wolden take oure bode. Takes þe tresore more and lasse, And lat vs quyt awey passe!” Þenne answeryd Kyng Richard: “In myn halff, j graunt þe foreward, So þat ?e lete vs quit jn come, It schal be don al and some.” Þey leten hem in come anon, Þey token hem into hostage ylkon, And into prisoun put hem þore, Olde and ?onge, lesse and more, Moste non out off Acres toun Tyl þat payde were þat raunsoun, And þe holy croys þerwiþ, Ar þey moste haue pes or griþ. Þere was ffounde catel strong, Þat was delyd þe kny?tes among. Cuntek was at þe jn-comyng; Þe beste tresore hadde R. oure kyng. Crystene presouns in Acres toun, He gaff hem cloþis gret ffoysoun; Mete and drynk and armes bry?te, And made hem fel ffor to ffy?t, And took hem into hys partyes To venge God off hys enemyes. Kyng R. in Acres hadde nome Off Sarezynys þat were þedir jcome, Þat were hys strengeste enemyes, Hardy kny?tes and off most prys, Off heþenesse cheff-lordynges, Prynces, dukes-sones, and kynges, Amyrallys, and many sawdan: Here names j ne telle can. In prisoun þey lay bounden ffaste, To þe Sawdon þey sente in haste: “We bere so manye grete cheynes, And þere men do vs so grete peynes, Þat we may neyþer sytte ne lye; But ?e vs out off prisoun bye, And wiþ raunsoun vs helpe and borwe, We schole dye or þe þrydde morwe.” Þe ryche Sawdon was woo þerfore; Prynces, eerles, weel twoo score, Amyrall, sawdon, and many lord, Seyden: “We rede, make acord Wiþ Kyng Richard, þat is so stoute, Ffor to delyuere oure chyldren oute, Þat þey ne be hongyd, ne to drawe. Off tresore Kyng R. wole be fawe; Þat oure chyldren may come hom hayl, Charges mules and hors, be oure counsayl, Off brende gold, and off bawdekyn, Ffor oure heyres to make ffyn. Men saye, Englyssche-men loue gyffte.” Off gold weel twenty mennys lyffte Were layd on mule and rabyte; Ten eerles, alle clad in samyte, Alle olde, hore, and nou?t ?ungge, Þat were weel avysy off tungge, To Kyng Richard þe tresore brou?te, On knees off grace hym besou?te: “Our Sawdon sendiþ þe þis tresore, And wole be þy ffrend eueremore, Ffor þe prisouns þat þou dest neme. Let hem goo wiþ lyff and leme! Out off prisoun þat þou hem lete, Þat no man hem slee ne bete, Ffor alle þey are dou?ty vassales, Kynges sones and amyrales, At þis tyme þe beste doande Þat be in alle Sarezyn land, And oure hoost most trustes too. Saladyn loues hem alsoo; Lese non off hem he wolde Nou?t for a þousand pound off golde.” Kyng Richard spak wiþ wurdys mylde: “Þe gold to take God me schylde: Among ?ow partes euery dele j charge, For j brou?te in schyppes and in barge More gold and syluyr wiþ me Þen has ?oure lord and swylke þree. To hys tresore haue j no nede! But, for my loue, j ?ow bede To mete wiþ me þat ?e dwelle, And afftyrward j schal ?ow telle, Þorw? counsayl j schal ?ow answere, What word ?e schal ?oure lord bere.” Þey grauntyd hym wiþ good wylle; Kyng Rychard callyd hys marchall stylle, And in counsayl took hym alone: “I schal þe telle what þou schalt don. Priuely goo to þe prisoun, Þe Sarezynys off most renoun, Þat be comen off þe ryhcheste kynne, Priuyly slee hem therin; And ar þe hedes be of smyten, Looke euery name be wryten Vpon a scrowe off parchemyn; And bere þe hedes to þe kechyn, And in a cawdroun þou hem caste, And bydde þe cook seþe hem ffaste; And loke þat he þe her off stryppe, Off hed, off berd, and eke off lyppe. Whenne we schole sytte and eete, Loke þat ?e nou?t fforgete To serue hem herewiþ in þis manere: Lay euery hed on a platere, Bryng it hoot forþ al in þyn hand, Vpward hys vys, þe teeþ grennand; And loke þey be nothynge rowe! Hys name faste aboue hys browe, What he hy?te, and off what kyn born(e). An hoot hed bryng me beforn; As j were weel apayde wiþal, Ete þeroff ry?t faste j schal, As it were a tendyr chyke, To se hou þe oþere wyl lyke.” Þe styward, so says þe ieste, Anon dede þe kynges byheste. At noon “a lauer” þe waytes blewe; Þe messangerys nou?t ne knewe Rychardis lawe ne hys custome. Sayde þe kyng: “Frendes, ?e are welco(me)!” To hem he was cumpanyable; Þey were set a syde-table. Salt was set on, but no bred, Ne watyr, ne wyn, whyt ne red. Þe Sarezynes saten, and gunne to stare, And þou?ten: “Allas, hou schal we ffare?” Kyng Richard was set on des, Wiþ dukes and eerles, prowde in pres; Ffro kechene com þe fyrste cours, Wiþ pypes, and trumpes, and tabours. Þe styward took ry?t good ?eme To serue, Kyng R. to queme, Lest afftyr mete hym tydde harm. A Sarezynys hed also warme (He) brou?te oure kyng, it was nou?t cleued, Hys name was wreten in hys forheued. Þe messangerys were seruyd soo, Euere an hed betwyxe twoo, In þe fforhede wreten hys name: Þeroff they had all grame! What þey were whenne þey seyen, Þe teres ran out off here eyen; And whenne þey þe lettre redde, To be slayn fful sore þey dredde. Kyng R. hys eyen on hem þrewe, Hou þey begunne to chaunge here hewe. Fore here ffrendes þey sy?yd sore, Þat þey hadde lost for euermore. Off here kynde blood þey were; Þenne þey my?te weel fforbere For to pleye and ffor to ley?e. Non off hem wolde hys mes ney?e, Ne þeroff eeten on morsel; Þe kyng sat and beheeld ffol wel. Þe kny?t þat scholde þe kyng serue Wiþ a scharp knyff þe hed gan kerue. Kyng Richard eet wiþ herte good, Þe Sarezynes wenden he hadde be wood. Euery man sat stylle, and pokyd oþir, Þey sayden: “Þis is þe deuelys broþir, Þat sles oure men and þus hem eetes!” Kyng Richard þoo nou?t forgetes; Abouten hym gan loke ful ?erne, Wiþ wraþ semblaunt, and eyen sterne. Þe messangers þoo he bad: “Ffor my loue bes alle glad, And lokes ?e be weel at eese! Why kerue ?e nou?t off ?oure mese, And eetes ffaste as j doo? Tel me why ?e louren soo?” Þey seten stylle, and sore quook, Þey durste neyþer speke ne look. Into þe erþe þey wolde haue crope, To be slayn fol weel þey hope. Þere was non answeryd a word. Quod Kyng R.: “Beres fro þe bord Þe mete þat ?e before hem sette, And oþer mete ye hem fette!” Men brou?ten bred, wiþouten bost, Venysoun, cranes, and good rost, Pyment, clarre, and drynkes lyþe; Kyng Richard bad hem alle be blyþe. Was non off hem þat eete lyste, Kyng Richard here þou?te wel wyste, And seyde: “Ffrendes, beþ nou?t squoymous, Þis is þe maner off myn hous, To be seruyd ferst, God it woot, Wiþ Sarezynys hedes al hoot: But ?oure maner j ne knewe! As j am kyng, Cristen, and trewe, ?e schole be þeroff sertayn In saff cundyt to wende agayn; For j ne wolde, ffor no thyng, Þat wurd off me in þe world scholde spryng I were so euyl off maneres For to mysdoo messangeres.” Whenne þey hadde eeten and cloþ was folde, Kyng R. gan hem to beholde: On knees þey askyd leue to gon. But off hem alle was þer nou?t on, Þat in message was þedyr come, Þat hym hadde leuere haue ben at home, Wiþ wyff, ffrendes, and her kynde, Þenne al þe good þat was in Ynde. Kyng Rychard spak to an old man: “Wendes hom, and tell ?oure Sawdan, Hys malycoly þat he abate, And says þat ?e come to late. To slowly was ?oure terme jgessyd; Or ?e come þe fflesch was dressyd Þat men scholden serue wiþ me Þus at noon, and my meyne. Say hym, it schal hym nou?t avayle, Þou? he forbarre oure vytayle, Fflesch and ffysch, samoun and cungir, We schal neuer dye ffor hungyr, Whyl that we may wenden to ffy?t, And slee þe Sarezynes dounry?t, Wassche þe fflesch, and roste þe hede; Wiþ oo Sarezyn j may wel ffede Wel a nyne, or a ten Off my goode Crystene-men. Kyng R. sayd, j you waraunt, Þer is no fflesch so norysschaunt Vnto an Ynglyssche Cristen-man, Partryck, plouer, heroun, ne swan, Cow ne oxe, scheep ne swyn, As is þe flesshe of a Sarezyn: Þere he is ffat, and þerto tendre, And my men are lene and sclendre. Whyl any Sarezyn quyk bee Lyuande now in þis cuntree, Ffor mete wole we noþyng care: Aboute ffaste we schole ffare, And euery day we schole eete Al so manye as we may gete. Into Yngelond wol we nou?t gon, Tyl þay be eeten euerylkon.” Þe messangerys agayn home tourned, Beffore þe lord þey comen and mourn(yd). Þe eldeste tolde þe Sawdan, Kyng R. was a no(ble) man, And sayde: “Lord, j þe werne, In þis world is non so sterne! On knees we tolde hym oure tale, But vs ne gaynyd no gale. Off þy gold wolde he non; He swor he hadde betere won Off ryche tresore þenne hast þou. To vs he sayde: ‘I geue it ?ow; Tresore off syluyr, gold, and palle, Deles it among ?ow alle!’ To mete he bad vs abyde, We were set at bord hym besyde, Þat stood Rychardes table negh; But non off vs before hym segh No bred brou?t forþ, whyt ne sour, But salt, and non oþir lycour. What mes fyrst before hym come, Weel j beheld, good keep j nome: A kny?t brou?te ffro þe kechyn An hed soden off a Sarezyn! Wiþouten her, on a plater brode, His name beforn hys hed-schode Was iwrete abouen hys y?e; Me standes non awe ffor to lye. Whos hed it was my feres aske, It was þe Sawdones sone off Damaske! At borde as we saten in ffere, We were seruyd in þis manere: Euere an hed betwen tweye; Ffor sorwe we wende ffor to deye! Þer come beffore my ffelaw and me Þe kynges sone of Nynyue, Hys off Perce hym þat sat me by, Þe þrydde hys off Samary, Þe ferþe hys off Egypte: Þoo ylkon off vs hys eyen wypte!

Beffore Kyng Rycharde a kny?t in haste Karff off þe hed, and he eet ffaste. Wiþ teeþ he grond þe flessch ful harde, As a wood lyoun he ffarde, Wiþ hys eyen stepe and grym; And spak, and we behelde hym, Ffor drede we wende ffor to sterue; He bad vs þat we scholde kerue Oure mes, and eeten as he dede; To Mahoun we boden oure bede, Ffro deþ þat he be oure waraunt! He segh oos make soure semblaunt, Ffor drede hou we begunne to quake; Oure mes he bad hys men vptake, And oþir mete þoo vs ffette, Hoot whyt bred before vs sette, Gees, swannes, cranes, venysoun, And oþir wylde ffoul gret ffoysoun, Whyte wyn and red, pyment and clarre, And sayde: ‘?e be welcom to me! Bes blyþe, ?yff it be ?oure wylle, Dos gladly, and lykes nou?t ylle, Ffor j knew nou?t noþyng ?oure gyse; In my court þis is þe seruyse, Be seruyd fferst, j and myn hynys, Wiþ hedes hote off Sarezynys.’ Off hym and hys we stode swilk eye, Ffor drede and dool we wende to deye; Non off vs eet morsel off bred, Ne drank off wyn, whyt ne red, Ne eete off fflesch, baken ne brede: So sory were we þenne for drede. Afftyr mete we tooke leue, He spak to vs wordes breue: ‘?e schole gon in saff coundyte; No man schal do ?ow desspyte.’ He sente þe certayn answere, Or þat we my?te come þere, Men off ryhcheste kyn were slawe; He geues ry?t nou?t þou? þou wiþdrawe, And hyde stor al ffro hys hoost; He says, and hys men make boost, That he schal nou?t lete on lyue In al þy land, man, chyld, ne wyue, But slee alle þat he may fynde, Seþe þe fflesch, and wiþ teeþ grynde. Hungyr schal hem neuere eyle, Into Yngelond wole he nou?t seyle Tyl he haue maad al playn werk.” His cloþis of gold vnto his scherk Saladyn began torase ffor yre. Kynges, prynces, and many a syre Seyden allas þat þey hadden lorn Here gentyl heyres of here boody born, Þat were so wyghte men and stronge. “Weylaway, we leue to longe! Herde we neuere swylke meruayle, It is a deuyl wiþoute ffayle. Allas þis werre was begunne! Now Richard has Acres wunne. He has ment, ?iff he may, go fforth To wynne est, west, souþ, and norþ, And eete oure chyldren and vs. Lord Saladyn, we rede þus: Sende to hym, and beseke hym efft Ffor hem þat ben on lyue lefft. Lete hem goo, ?yff so he wolde, Geue hym, siþþe he wole no golde, Riche jewelles, ffor þe nones, Fful of ryche þrecyouse stones; Chargyd in harneys and in coffre. Soo þat he wole, þou hym profere, For to lete Jhesu and Mary, To geue hym land a gret party, Þat he be in pes, and lete þe werre. For þat he is comen ffrom so ferre, Wylt þou nou?t þat he hys trauayle lese. Graunte hym come hymselff and chese Þe landes þat hym lyketh best, And make hym Sawdon heyest Afftyr þyself, and ryhcheste kyng, Conferme it hym and hys ofspryng. ?yff he be payed to doo so, Swyþe in pes he come the to. Þou? he haue þy folk jschent, Þou schalt fforgeue thy maltalent, As þy broþir hym loue and kysse; And he schal teche þe and wysse In werre to be bold and wys, Off al þe world to wynne the prys. Lyffe togedire, and be frendes, With joye to your lyues endes.” Saladyn by hys seriauntes Sende Kyng R. þese presauntes, And bysoughte hym off hys men Þat he hadde in hostage þen, And ?yff he wolde Jhesu forsake, And Mahowne to his lorde take, Of Surrye he wolde make hym kyng, And off Egipte, þat ryche þyng, Off Darras, and off Babyloyne, Off Arabye, and off Cessoyne, Off Affryk, and of Bogye, And off þe lond off Alysaundrye, Off Grete-Grece, and off Tyre, And off many a ryche empyre; And make hym he wolde Sawdoun anon Off al Ynde, vnto Preter Jhon. Kyng R. answeryd þe messangeres: “Ffy vpon ?ow losyngeres, On ?ow, and Saladyn ?oure lorde! Þe deuyl hange ?ow be a corde! Gos, and says to Saladyn Þat he make to morwe ffyn Ffor alle hys dogges in hostage, Or þey schole dye in euyl rage! And ?yff j mowe leue a fewe ?ere, Off alle þe landes ?e haue nempnid here I schal hym leue nou?t halff a ffoote, So God doo my soule boote! I wolde nought lese my lordes loue For alle the londes vnder heuene aboue. And but j haue þe croys to morwe, His men schole dye wiþ mekyl sorwe.” They answeryd at the frome Þey nyste where it was become. Quod Kyng Rychard: “Siþþen it is soo, I wot weel what j haue to doo. ?oure Sawdon is nou?t so slye So queyntyly to blere myn y?e.” He callyd hys kny?tes anone, And bad hem into Acres gon: “And take Sarezynes syxty þousandes, And knytte behynde hem here handes; And ledes hem out off þe cyte, And hedes hem wiþouten pyte; And so j schal teche Saladyn To pray me leue on Appolyn!” Þey wer brou?t out off þe toun, Saue twenty he heeld to raunsoun. Þey wer led into a place fful euene, Þere þey herden an aungele off heuene Þat seyde: “Seynyours, tuez, tuese, Spares hem nou?t, behediþ þese!” Kyng Richard herde þe aungelys voys, And þankyd God and þe holy croys. Þey were behedyd hastelyke, And caste into a ffoul dyke. Þus Kyng Richard wan Acrys, God graunte hys soule moche blys! Hys dou?ty dedes whoso wyl lere, Herkenes now, and ?e mowe here. Merye is in þe tyme off May Whenne foules synge in here lay. Ffloures on appyl trees and perye, Smale ffoules synge merye, Ladyes strowen here boures Wiþ rede roses, and lylye ffloures. Gret ioye is in ffriþ and lake, Beste and bryd plays wiþ his make; Þe damyseles lede daunse; Kny?tes playen wiþ scheeld and launse, Jn joustes and turnementes þey ryde, Many a caas hem betyde, Many chaunces, and strokes hard! So beffel þat Kyng Richard Kyng Phelyp to feste bad; Afftyr mete, þoo þey were glad, Rychard gaff gyfftes, gret wones, Gold, and syluyr, and precyouse stones; To herawdes, and to dysours, To tabourrers, and to trumpours Hors and robes to bere his los; Þorw? here cry his renoun ros, Hou he was curteys and ffree. Fful noble was þat ensemble. Kyng R. gaff castelles and tounnes To hys eerlys and to barounnes To haue þerjnne her sustenaunce. Kyng Richard bad þe Kyng of Ffraunce: “Geue off þy gold and off þy purchase To erl, baroun, kny?t, and servaunt off mace! Ffrely aquyte þou hem here trauayle, Þey swonke for þe in bataylle; ?yff þou haue efft wiþ hym to done, Þey wole be þe gladdere efftsone To helpe þe at þy nede.” Kyng Phelyp took þeroff non hede, But layde þertoo a deff eere, And gaff hym ry?t non answere; Kyng Richardes wordes he took in vayn. Richard began vnto hym sayn: “Among vs be pes and acord! Graced be Jhesu Cryst oure Lord, Þat gaff vs my?t þis toun to wynne! To ryde fforþ lat vs begynne Saladyn þe Sawdon to anoye, And ffonde hym for to destroye. ?yff he scounffyte vs in bekyr, ?yff nede be, we mowe be sekyr. ?yff God us haue lyff jschape, And we may hedyr ascape, And come quyk wiþjnne þe walle, Ffor Saladyn and hys ffolk alle, —And þe ?ates be weel jschet— We be sekyr off strong recet.” Kyng R. gan Phelyp to telle: “J rede we here no lengere dwelle; Ryde we forþ þe countre to seche; And, Phelyp, doo as j þe teche. Myn hoost j schal parte on þree, And Kyng Phelyp tak þy meyne, Departe hem in hostes tweye, And looke þou doo as j þe seye. Toun, cytee, and castel ?yff þou wynne, Slee alle þe ffolk þat be þerinne! In Goddes name j þe forbede Ffor gold, syluyr, ne for no mede Þat þey may profere and geuen, Ryche ne pore lat non leuen, Hosebonde ne wyff, mayde ne grome, But ?iff he wole take Crystyndome!” Phelyp þe wurdes vndyrstood, Anon he gan to change mood Þat Kyng Richard at hys deuys Sette hym and hese at so lytyl prys. Phelyp to hym was cumpanyable, He gan to glose, and make ffable, And þankyd hym wiþ glad semblaunt, And sayde: “Broþir, j þe graunt To doo as þou sayst, sekyrly, Ffor þou art wysere man þan j, And off werre canst wel more.” Neþeles he was agreuyd sore; Ffor drede he and hys men so dede As Kyng Richard hadde hem bede, In auenture þat he hente knokkes. Hys men he delyd in twoo fflokkes; Richard wiþ hys hoost wente hys way, And ffro hym to wynne pray. Wiþ loue þey departyd asundyr, But now ?e may here a wundyr. Ffrenssche men arn arwe and ffeynte, And Sarezynys be war, and queynte, And off here dedes engynous; Þe Ffrenssche men be couaytous. Whenne þey sytte at þe tauerne, Þere þey be stoute and sterne Bostfful wurdes ffor to crake, And off here dedes ?elpyng to make. Lytyl wurþ þey are and nyce prowde, Ffy?te þey cunne wiþ wurdes lowde, And telle no man is here pere; But whene þey comen to þe mystere, And see men begynne strokes dele, Anon þey gynne to turne here hele, And gynne to drawe in here hornes As a snayl among þe þornes; Slake a bore of their boost! Kyng Phelyp anon wiþ hys hoost A strong cyte he besette Þat was callyd Taburette. Wiþ hys hoost he layde it aboute, Þe Sarezynes my?te neyþer jn ne oute, Leste þey scholden be tohewe. On þe walles armyd þey hem schewe, Out off toureles and off kyrnelles, Sette vp baners and penselles, And manly gan hem to deffende. Þere to dye þe Ffrenssche wende.

But off the toun þe cheff-amyrayle, Hys name was callyd Terryabaute: “Lord, ar þou geue vs assaute, Alle þe ffolk off þis toun Profere hem to knele adoun, And rewefully wiþ oo cry To seke þe mildely off mercy; And þe toun þey wole vnto þe ?elde, And alle þe goodes þat þey welde.

Alle þey sworen hym hool oþ To be hys men þat were þere, And hys baner þey vp rere On a schafft in þe heyeste tour, Wiþ flour-de-lys off gold and asour. Þoo þey hadde þis jwunne, To breke sege þenne þey begunne. Þey chargyd in waynes and in cartes Swerdes and speres, scheeldes and dartes; Kyng, eerles, barouns, kny?tes, and squyers, Ryden ryally on trappyd destrers, Þe ffoote-men ?ede on here ffeete, Ry?t soo þey helden þe hey?e strete, Þat þey turne nou?t ne outraye.

Phelyp off hem took raunsoun, Ry?t as he dede at þe oþir toun, And leet hem leue fforþ in pes, But ffor þe lesse þe more he les. Kyng R. wiþ hys hoost gan ryde, And wente be anoþir syde, Wiþ many an eerl and baroun Iborn off Ynglyssche nacyoun, Alle hardy men, and stronge off boones, And weel armyd ffor þe nones.

Euery man belayde hys toun aboute, No Sarezyn durste come wiþoute, Ffor þe sege was strong and hard. But speke we now off Kyng Richard Þat Sudan Turry has belayd. Þe Sarezynes at þe ffyrste brayd Here brygges wounden vp in haste, And here ?ates barryd ffaste; Hem to deffende þey gunne asaye. Kyng R. hys baner leet dysplaye: Whenne þe Sarezynys say? it arerde, Off hym þey were sore afferde, Ffor drede þey begunne to quake. Here wardayn has hys counsayl take —He was callyd Grandary— In þe cyte he leet make a cry Ylke a man þat my?te armes bere, Goo to þe wal þe toun to were. Þe Sarezynes armyd forþ lepe Vpon þe walles þe toun to kepe, Stout in touret, and in hurdys. Richard bente an arweblast off vys, And schotte it to a tour fful euene, And it smot þorw? Sarezynes seuene: Dede ffyl þe dogges vyle, But lystenes off a queynte gyle! Kyng R. leet hys ffolk apparayle On þat on halff þe toun to assayle, Þe toun-ffolk drow? to þat on syde. Kyng R. sente off hys men þat tyde On hey?e laddres for to gon jn Þat weren jwrou?t off queynte gyn. Wiþ yrene hokes, goode and stronge, On þe walles þey gunne hem honge. Seuene men my?ten gon in on brede; Þus men ouyr þe walles ?ede, Þree þousande, or þe Sarezynes wende, So þey gan þe toun deffende. Þe Crystene comen jn or þey weten; Þey schotten to hem, and harde smeten, Gret peple off hem doun ffelle. But þoo þe cunstable herde telle Þat þe Crystene were jn comen, Ten þousand he has jnomen, Þe oþere he leete kepe þe toun: “Ffor þese”, he sayde, “gos no raunsoun, Thar hem no mercy craue! Kyng R. schal hem neuere saue, Anon ry?t þey schole deye.” Whenne Kyng R. herde hem so seye, Ffor scorn he gan to law?e schrylle, And bad hys men be off good wylle: “And proue we þis toun to wynne, Rescue þis ffolk þat be wiþjnne.” Þe Sarezynes kydden here my?t Þe Crystene to sle dounry?t Þat were comen ouyr þe walle. Oure ffolk togedere heeld hem alle, Arwes and quarelles to hem drowen, Alle þat þay hytten anon þay slowen, Wiþ egre mayn gaff hem bekyr, Off good help ffor þey were sekyr Off Kyng R. þat was wiþouten. Oure Crystene-men ran abouten, And some to þe ?ates threwe, Alle þat þey ffounden down þay hewe, And þrewen hem out off þe tour, And cryeden: “Sere kyng, do vs socour! Sauely þou schalt in come, In lytyl whyle it schal be nome!” Þus þey gunne Kyng R. grete, And þe brygges doun þay lete, And setten þe ?ates vp on brode: Kyng R. was þe ffyrste þat jn rode, And next hym Roberd Tourneham, Robert of Leycetre, and Sere Bertram. Þese reden in þe vawmewarde, To slee þe houndes non ne sparde. Kyng R. hys ax in hond he hente, And payde Sarezynys here rente. Swylke leuery he hem delte, Al þat he hytte anon þey swelte. Þey slowe euery Sarezyn, And tooke þe temple off Appolyn, Þey ffelde it doun, and brende Mahoun. And al þe tresoure off þe toun He gaff to kny?t, squyer, and knaue, Al so mekyl as þey wolde haue. Sarezynes none on lyue he laffte. But in a tour on an hey? schaffte Kyng R. sette vp hys baner, And wan þe toun on þis manere. Now beþ in pes, lystenes a pas! I schal ?ow telle off Sere Thomas, Þe noble baroun off Multone, Þat lay wiþ many a modyr sone At Orglyous, a strong castel. Lystnes now what chaunce befel! Þe Sarezynes ffor ffelonye Soone senten out a spye Þat hadde ben Crystene in hys ?ouþe; Many a euyl wrenche he couþe! He come to Thomas, and þus sayde, And þou?te to haue hym betrayde: “Sere, j am a Crystene-man; I brak prisoun, and out j wan. Truste ry?t wel to my speche! ?iff þou wylt doo as j þe teche, Þou schalt wynne hem in a whyle. In al þe toun þer is no gyle; Þe soþe to þe j am beknowe.” Quod Thomas: “Byndes hym in a þrowe! Al is les þat þe þeff saiþ: He is at þe Sarezynes faiþ; He was sent vs to beswyke; Hys comyng schal hym euele lyke. Þerfore he schal anon dyen: So schal men teche hym to lyen! And hys eeren in twoo slyttes, And to hys ffeet a strong roop knyttes, And hanges hym vp tyl he dye.” Quod þe renay: “Mercy j crye! To no vyle deeþ ?e me dooþ! Al þat j can j schal seye soþ. ?yff ?e me fynde in falshede, Oþer in wurd, oþer in dede, Þat ?e mowe euere see or wyten, Anon myn hed ?e off smyten! I was sent to betraye ?ow; I schal ?ow telle; herkenes how! Before þe ?ate is a brygge— Lestnes weel what j schal sygge— Vndyr þe brygge þer is a swyke, Couerde clos, ioynande queyntelyke; And vndyrneþe is an hasp, Schet wiþ a stapyl and a clasp; And in þat hasp a pyn is pylt; Þou my?t bewar ?iff þou wylt. Me were wol loþ þat þou mystydde; Þou? þou and þy ffolk were in þe mydde, And þe pyne smettyn out were, Doun ?e scholden fallen þere, Jn a pyt syxty fadme deep: Þerffore bewar, and tak good keep! At þe passyng ouyr þe trappe Many on has had full euyl happe. Be peays it closes togedere a?en; Where it is no man may seen.” “Now, Sarezyn, anon me rede Hou we schole doo at þis nede?” “Þou hase horsmen and puttayle; Er þanne þou þe toun assayle, ?e haue wiþ ?ow goode engynes, Swylke knowe but fewe Sarezynes, A mangenel þou doo arere, And soo þou schalt hem weel afere. Into þe toun þou slynge a ston grete, And al so swyþe þou me lete Passe into þe toun a?en; And al so soone þou schalt seen Þe toun þey schole ?elde soone. But j bydde þe a bone: ?iff j doo þe wynne þis toun, Þat þou geue me my warysoun.” Quod Thomas: “Þertoo j graunte.” Þey departyd wiþ þat comenaunte. Þe engyne was bent, and set al preste, A gret ston into þe toun was keste. Þey slowe men, and houses doun bare Or ony man off hem was ware. “We be ded! Help Mahoun!” þey cryede; On euery syde away þey hyede To hyden hem for woo and drede. Þe renay into þe toun ?ede, And sayde to þe wardayn Orgayl: “We be dede wiþouten ffayl! He þat þe ston þo ?ow þrewe, Al ?oure tresoun fol wel he knewe: Hou ?oure brygge gos insundyr, And al þe tresoun þat is þervndyr; And hou it gos a?en be peys. Bes war, barounnes and burgeys! It helpes ?ow nou?t ?oure ?ates to schette Hym and hys men out ffor to lette. ?yff ?e ffy?te and ?ow deffende, Moo stones he wole ?ow sende, Schende ?ow, and þe toun doun bete, Stondynge hous wil he non lete. It is betere let hym in stylle Þan herejnne þat he ?ow spylle: Þenne we may be trust to leue.” But whenne he hadde þis counsayl geue, As he hem redde þey deden anon. “Mercy, Thomas!” þey cryede echon, “Haue here þe keyes of þis cyte; Doo þerwiþ what þy wille bee, (?iff) soo þou graunte vs oure lyues, And oure chyldren, and oure wyues.” Thomas of Multoun the keyes did ffong, And anoþer ston in slong To Sere Mahouns habitacle, And smot out a gret pynacle. Out com the wardayn Orgayl, And an hundryd kny?tes in his parayl, Barffoot, vngyrt, wiþouten hood: “Mercy, Thomas, spylle nou?t oure blood! Tak þe alle þe goodes þat we haue, Wiþ þat þou wylt oure lyues saue, Lat vs passe awey al nakyd.” “Brekes þe brygge,” quod Thomas, “þat ?e han mak(yd), And lyme and ston þrowes in þe pyt; Or, be Jhesu, þat in heuene syt, Alle þerjnne ?e schole brenne, Þat non schal goo ne out renne, Off ?ow alle, pore ne ryche, But ?yff ?e fylle weel þe dyche To þe banke al in a resse, Þat we anon may faste in presse.” Þe amyral þeroff was blyþe, And brak þe brygges alsoo swyþe, And lym and ston keste in þe pytte; Anon it was feld, and ffordytte, (V)p to þe banke maad al playn In lengþe and brede, ful trust, certayn, Þat twenty men, oþir besyde, On armyd stedes my?ten jn ryde, Wiþouten drede haue entree: Þus þey come to that cytee. Þe toun-ffolk comen alle and some, And ffayre hym þey gunne welcome, Cryede mercy wiþ lowde steuene; Agayn on Crystene-man þey were seuene Jn þat cyte off Sarezynes. Gold, and syluyr, and bawdekynes To Sere Thomas anon þey profere; And wiþ good wyl to hym offere Landes, houses, and tresore Off hym to holde ffor eueremore. Before Thomas com þe renay: “Mercy, Lord, þynk, j þe pray, Ffor þis toun what þou me hi?te, As þou were a gentyl kni?te. No more wole j þat þou me geue, But mete and drynk whyl þat j leue. Wollewarde, on my bare ffeet I schal walken in snow? and sleet Me to amende of my synne, Þe ioye of heuene for to wynne!” To a preest he schrooff hym clene. Þe comenaunt þat was hem betwene, Thomas grauntyd wiþ good wylle; Þus wiþ hym he leffte stylle In werre and pes whare he gan wende, Euere vnto hys lyues ende. Lordynges, heres to my pleynte! ?e schal here of a tresoun queynte, Hou þe Sarezynes haue bespoken Off Crystene-men to ben awroken, Hou þe amyrayl hem redde: “Whenne þe Crystene be to bedde, And þer be in here fyrste sleepe, We schole come, armyd, on a hepe. On schal dwelle þe clos wiþjnne Þe ?ate to vnschette and vnpynne, And stylly to vnschette þe lok. We schole come priuyly in a flok, And slee Thomas off Multone, And wiþ hym euery modyr sone Þat he has wiþ hym brou?t.” Þeroff Sere Thomas wyste ry?t nou?t. Þey soden fflesch, rost and brede, And to þe soper faste þey ?ede. Plente þer was of bred and wyn, Pyment, clarry, good and ffyn; Off cranes, swannes, and venysoun, Partryhches, plouers, and heroun, Off larkes, and smale volatyle. Þe Sarezynes al ffor a gyle Of strengeste wyn gaf hem to drynke. Þe were wery, and lest weel wynke; Þey slepte faste, and gunne to route. Þe Sarezynes þey were alle wiþoute, And comen armyd to þe ?ate; Þe renay stood redy þerat. Þey knokked on þe wyket, He leet it stande stylle jschet, And tolde Thomas þat he herde Al togedere hou it fferde. Sere Thomas no bost gan make, Anon hys ffolk he gan to awake; “Ffor Goddys loue,” he hem bed, “Dy?te ?ow tyt, or ?e ben ded!” Þey sterte vp, and were affrayde Ffor þat he hadde to hem sayde. Þey armyd hem swyþe ?erne, And wenten out by a posterne Er þenne þe Sarezynys wyste; Þat whyle þey houyd, and gunne to þreste, Wiþ strengþe wolden in haue wunnen, Þe Crystene to þe ?atys runnen, And schetten faste wiþ þe kaye. By þat began to sprynge þe daye. Bowe and arweblast þe Cristene bente, Þorw?out euery stret þey wente, And schotten arwes and quarel; Many Sarazyn ded doun ffel. Þey ne leffte be way ne hous No man leuande in Orglyous, Burgeys, ne wyff, ne children ?yng. Whenne þey had maad þis rekenyng, He gaff hys men aftire þat toyle Al þe tresore, and þe dispoyle, Syluyr and gold euery grot; Euery man hadde hys lot. Þer was non so lytyl page Þat ne hadde to hys wage Off gold, and syluyr, and gret tresore To be ryche ffor eueremore. Thomas leet, or he went þen, Out of prisoun þe Crystene-men, Euery pylgrym and palmere; Gaff hym rente and hous þere; Wiþ hem stabled þe toun a?en. Who so com þer my?te weel seen In ylke an hy? cheff-touret Kyng Richardes armes were vp set. Lordynges, now ?e haue herd Off þese townes hou it fferd; Hou Kyng R. wiþ hys maystry Wan þe toun off Sudan Turry; Orglyous wan Thomas Multone, And slow? euery modyr sone. Off Ebedy we schal speke, Þat faste now haþ here ?ate steke, Whenne Ffouke Doyly it bylay, Þat entre jn nou?t he may. Þe cyte was strong and stoute; Seuene myle it was aboute; Þrytty pryse-toures be tale, In euery tour a cheeff-amyrale; Ffolk off armes by ry?t ascent Numbred þer were ffyfty þousend, Wiþouten oþere smale putayle Þat þere come into þe batayle, Þat ne cowde no man acounte To how manye þey wolde amounte. Sere Ffouke brou?te goode engynes, Swylke knewe but fewe Sarezynes; In euery half he leet hem arere His enemyes a newe play to lere. A mangenel he leet bende, To þe prys-tour a ston gan sende. Þat ston whanne it out ffley?, Þe Sarezynes þat it sey?, “Allas!” þey cryede, and hadden wondyr, “It routes as it were a þondyr!” On þe tour þe ston so hytte, Þat twenty feet awey it smytte. To anoþer a ston he þrewe For to make hem game newe. Al þat on syde he smot away, And slow? dogges off fals ffay. Þey beet doun þe toures alle In þe toun and on þe walle. A prys-tour stood ouyr þe ?ate; He bente hys engyne, and þrew þerate A gret ston þat harde droff, Þat þe tour al toroff; Þe barre, and þe hurdys, Þe ?ate barst, and þe porte-colys. Þerto he gaff anoþir strook To breke þe bemes alle off ook; And slow? þe folk þat þerjnne stood; Þe oþere fledden, and were ny? wood, And sayden it was þe deuelys dent. “Allas, Mahoun! What has he ment, Þis Ynglyssche dogge þat hy?te Fouke? He is no man, he is a pouke Þat out off helle is jstole! An euyl deþ moot he þole, Ffor vs he beseges ffaste; ?yff he moo stones to vs caste, Al þis toun wole be doun bete; Stondande hous wole he non lete!” Sere Ffouke gan hym apparaylle Wiþ his ffolk þe toun to assaylle. Or he þe toun wiþ strengþe wan, Þer was slayn many a man! Þe toun-dykes on euery syde, Þey were depe and fful wyde, Fful off grut, no man my?te swymme; Þe wal stood faste vpon þe brymme: Bytwen hem my?te no man stande. Þe archers al off þis lande Schotte in wiþ arewes smale; Þe toun-ffolk ne gaff no tale. Þe Sarezynes wenten vpon þe walles, And schotte wiþ areweblast and spryngalles, And wiþ quarelles þey gunne hem stonye, Of oure ffolk þey slowen monye: Enuenymyd here takyl was. But whenne Fouke Doyly sey? þat caas, Þat hys men scholde be slawe, He bad hem to wiþdrawe: “And brynges trees and many a bow?.” To don hys wylle folk come jnow?. Crystene-men maden hem a targe Off dores and off wyndowes large. Some cau?ten a bord, and some an hach, And brou?ten to tymbyr, and þach, And grete schydes, and þe wode, And slunge it into þe mode, And þe þach aboue þeron, Þat Crystene-men my?te on gon To þe wal, and stonde sekyr, And hand be hand to geue bekyr. A sory beuerage þere was browen! Quarellys and arewys þykke fflowen; Þe Ynglyssche slowe þat þey toke. Durste no man ouer þe walles loke, Þat þe Crystene hem ouyrþrew. And wylde ffyr ouyr þe walles þey blewe, Many an hous anon ry?t Bycome vpon a fayr ly?t, Many a lane, and many a strete. Þe Sarezynes þoo for hete Drow? out godes, and ffaste gan fflye; “Allas” and “Help” lowde gan þey crye. Þe Ynglyssche-men herde þe cry, Þey were stronge and wel hardy; To wynne þe toun weel þey wende. Þey wiþjnne hem weel deffende: Þou? it were soo þat on doun ffalle, Anoþer styrte vpon þe walle In þe stede þere he stood, And weryd it weel wiþ herte good. Among þe toun-ffolk was no game. To counseyl þey gaderyd hem insame, Þenne sayde þe cheff-amyrale: “Lordynges, lystnes to my tale! Þis sege is gret, þys ffyr is stronge; Þus may we nou?t dure longe. To slen vs þey haue gret desyre, Þey haue set oure toun a ffyre. Pes off hym tydes vs no graunt, But it be at swylke a comenaunt Þat we oure God Mahoun forsake, And Crystyndom vndyrtake, And trowe in Jhesu and Mary. Despyt it wore and velony Þat we scholde leue on ffals lay! Go arme hym euery man þat may, Þat strong is wepene ffor to bere, And ffonde we þis toun to were! Off hoost we haue swylke ten, As he has off Crystene men To ffy?te wiþ vs now hedyr brou?t. Bes bolde, and doutes hym ry?t nou?t. Betere it is þat we out renne Þenne as wrehches in hous to brenne, And ffrye in oure owne gres! Englysshe be ffeynte and herteles; Off mete and drynk þey haue defawte. We schole hem slee alle in asawte, And ffelle hem alle in þe feelde. Hangyd be he þat þis toun ?elde To Crystene-men whyl he may leue!” But whenne he hadde þis counseyl geue, Euery man hys armes on keste, And to hym þey come alle preste. Ffor to ffy?te þey were fful ffel; To here temple þey wente ffull snell, Ylke a man armyd in hys queyntyse, And made þere here sacrefyse, To Mahoun, and to Jupiterre, Þat he hem helpe in here werre: “We hadde neuere nede or now! And here we make hym oure avow, Þe prys þis day ?iff þat we wynne, Þat we schole neuere blynne Ffor to ffy?te wiþ Crystene schrewe, Tyl þat þey ben al tohewe.” In foure partyes þey delte here route, And at the foure ?ates þey issuyd oute. The ffyrste hoost Sere Arcade ledde, Al aboute on brede þey spredde; Sere Cudary ledde þat oþir, And wiþ hym Orphias hys broþir; Þe þrydde hoost wiþ hym gan lede Sere Materbe, wy?t in wede; Sere Gargoyle ledde þe fferþe; Þere þey rede, al þe erþe Vndyr þe hors-feet it quook. Sere Ffouke beheeld, and gan to look. Here ffolk were rengyd in þat playn, Ffoure score þousand, forsoþe to sayn, Off ffoot-men, kny?tes, and squyers; And off lordes wiþ baners Þere were syxty amyrales, Þe soþ to say, in sertayn tales. On stedes weel trappyd armyd þey ryde, Redy batayle to abyde. Sere Ffouke gan hys ffolk ordeyne As þey scholde hem demeyne: Fformeste he sette hys arweblasteres, And afftyr þat hys gode archeres, And afftyr hys staff-slyngeres, And oþere wiþ scheeldes and wiþ speres. He deuysyd þe fferþe part Wiþ swerd and ax, knyff and dart; Þe men off armes com al þe last. Quod Fouke: “Seres, beþ nou?t agast, Þou? þat þey ben moo þan wee!” Þey blyssyd hem, and ffel on kne: “Ffadyr, and Sone, and Holy Gost,” Quod Fouke, “kepe þe Crystene-hoost! Mary mylde oure erande bede! Þy chyld vs helpe at oure nede, And kepe oure honour, we þe preye! Prest we ben ffor þe to deye, And ffor hys loue þat deyde on roode!” Þe Sarezynes wiþ egre mode Here wepenes begunne for to grype; Þey trumpyd anon, and gunne to pype. To ffy?te þe Crystene were ful swyfft; Ylke a lord hys baner gan vp lyfft Of kynde armes off hys owen, Þat his men scholde hym knowen, And to ffolewe hym þat tyde In þe bataylle where þey gan ryde. Sarezynes come wiþ gret wylle; When þe Crystene my?t drawe hem tylle, To schete þe arweblasteres hem dresse, And þe archeres to hem gesse. Sere Ffouke leet sette vp a standard Wiþ armes off þe Kyng Richard; Whenne þe Sarezynes it sen, Þey wende Richard hadde þer jben, Among hem alle in bataylle þore; Off hym þey were adred fful sore. Kny?tes and amyralles prowde, “Kylles doun ry?t”, þey cryeden lowde, “Brynges þe cyte out off cares! Hangyd be he þat hys ffoo spares!” Sere Archade took a gret launse, And come prykande wiþ bobaunce. To Ffouke Doly he gan it bere, And wiþ anoþir Ffouke mette hym þere; Ry?t in pleyn cours in þe ffeelde He hytte hym vpon þe scheelde. Ry?t þorw?out þe herte it karff, Þe mysbeleuyd paynym starff. Wiþ bost com Sere Cudary Agayn a Crystene kny?t hardy. Wiþ a fawchoun he gan hym smyte, Sekyrly it wolde weel byte. In þe nekke he hytte hym wiþal, Þat þe hed trendelyd off as a bal. On a rabyte com Orphias, Ffor bost he prekyd a gret pas; A gret ffawchoun in hand he bar: “Come ffy?t wiþ me now hoo þat dar!” Jhon Doyly, Sere Ffoukes nevewe, A ?ong kny?t off gret vertew, In hande he took a spere long, Þat was boþe styff and strong, And in hys scheeld he smot hym soo, Þat it cleuyd euene in twoo, And slow? hym þere sekyrly, And sayde: “Dogge, þere þou ly, And reste þe þere tyl domysday, Ffor þou art payyde off þy pay!” Togedere whenne þe hoostes mete, Þe archers my?ten no more schete; Men off armes þe swerdes out breyde, Balles out off hoodes soone þei pleyde. Swylke strokes þey hem geuen, Þat helme and bacynet al toreuen, Þat on þe schuldre ffel þe brayn. Þe Crystene-men slowe hem wiþ mayn. Þe ffoote-ffolk and sympyl knaues, Jn hande þey henten fful goode staues; Þer was no Sarezyn in þat fflok, But ?iff þat he hadde had a knok Wiþ a staff wel jset On helm, oþer on bacynet, Þat he ne ?ede doun, saun ffayle, Off hys hors top ouer taylle. Sone wiþjnne a lytyl stounde Þe moste party ?ede to grounde. The lordes say? hou þat þey spedde, Anon hastyly þey ffledde, Into þe toun þey wolde agayn. Sere Ffouke and hys men þeroff were ffayn Þe paas to kepe and to lette, On euery halff þey hem wiþsette, Þat non off hem ne my?te ascape. Þe Crystene on hem gan faste to frape. Whenne þe ffoot-folk weren jslawe, Grete lordynges doun þey drawe Off stedes and rabytes trappyd; Anon here hedes were of chappyd. Þat Jhesu hem helpyd it was wel sene. Þe Sarezynes þay slewe alle clene, Stryppyd hem nakyd to þe serke. But whene þey hadde maade al pleyn w(erk), Sere Fouk, þat noble man and wys, Wiþ trumpes he leet blowe þe prys. No man wolde þo dogges berye; Crystene-men resten, and maden hem mer(ye). Off good wyn ylke man drank a drau?t, And whenne þat þey herte hadde cau?te, Colyd hem, and keuered her (state), Anon þey broke þe toun-?ate. Syre Ffouk wiþ his men in rode, No Sarezyn þere hym abode. Euery Sarezyn þat þey mette, Wiþ swyche wessayl þey hem grette Ffor the loue off her Mahoun, Þat by þe schuldre þey schooff þe croun. Þe ffoote-men come behynde, And slow? alle þat þey my?te ffynde. Man, wumman, al ?ede to swerde, Boþe in hous and eke in ?erde. Þe Crystene-men þe fyr gan qwenche; Þere was more good þan man my?te þenche Off syluyr and gold in þat cyte: Þe Crystene-men hadde gret plente. Fful curteysely seyde Sere Ffouke, “Euery man hys wynnyng brouke Amonges ?ow alle to dele and dy?te.” Ffor good was no nede to ffy?te. Crystene-men Sere Ffouk lete In euery lane and euery strete To take keep, and to wake, By ny?t and day warde to make, Ffor to saue weel a ffyn Ffro þe Sawdon Saladyn. On þe toun-wal on euery corner He leet sette vp a baner, Vpon a schafft brode dysplayde, Wiþ Kyng Richardes armes portrayde, In sygne to bere record Þat Kyng Richard was here ouyr-lord. Whenne he hadde stabelyd þe toun, Wiþ hys hoost he wente boun To Orglyous to Sere Thomas. Fforþ þey wenten a gret pas To Kyng Rychard to Sudan Turry, And he hem took, and sette hym by. Euery man tolde oþer is chaunce. To hem come þe Kyng of Fraunce. Vnto Acres þey gan turne Afftyr swynk þere too soiurne, To dwelle and reste hem a stounde, To hele hem þat hadde gret wounde. Vpon a day afftyrward Kyng Phelyp eet wiþ Kyng Richard, Dukes, eerles, and barouns, Men off Ffraunce off most renouns; Wiþ hem alle þe kny?tes ffree Þat þey brou?ten ffro be?unde þe see; Thomas of Multone, Ffouke Doyly, Erles, and barouns, sykyrly, Off Yngelond, Gascoyne, and off Spayne, Off Lumbardy, Gyan, and Alemayne. Trumpes blewen, tabours dasshen Mete was greyþid, þey gunne to wasschen. Þey were set doun at a table, And weel jseruyd, wiþouten ffable, To here talent off fflesch and ffysch, Ffrensschemen, Lumbardes, Gascoynes, Ynglysch. Off ryche wyn þer was plente, Pyment and ryche clarre. Afftyr mete þe cloþ was drawe; Off here comynge Rychard was fawe. Afftyr mete þey maden game, Þey begynne to speke insame. Quod Kyng Richard: “Euery man telle Hou he has don, hou hym beffelle; Whoo has ben in most dystresse, And who has don þe moste prowesse. I myselff wan Sudan Turry, Off the ffolk hadde j no mercy. Alle þat þer wore j and myn hoost slow?, And wunne þerjnne tresore jnow?; Crystene-men þerjnne wone.” Thomas gan hys dedes mone: “And j wan Castel Orglyous; Maydyn and grome, hosebonde and spous Myn hoost slow?, and non ouyrhaff Al þe tresore þat hem j gaff.” Þoo tolde Ffouke Doyly: “And j wan þe cyte off Ebedy, Gaynyd hem no mercy to crye; What scholde dogges doo but dye? Al þe fflok hoppyd hedeless; In þis manere j made pes, Destroyyd alle þe heþene blood. To Crystene-men al þe good I gaff þat j þerjnne ffond, And stablyd it into Crystene-hond.” Quod Phelyp: “And j dede nou?t soo; Taburet and Archane j wente too: Þe ffolk come off boþe cytees, Cryde mercy, and ffylle on knees. Ffor euery hed j took raunsoun; Þey ?olde to me euery toun, And vp þay sette my baner: We weren at on in þis maner. To sloo men was me neuere leeff.” Kyng R. took it to greff, And on hym gan to loke rowe: “Cursyd be he þat þy werk alowe! Þou were weel wurþy mawgry to haue, Sarezynes þat þou woldyst saue; Ffor to graunte hem lyff ffor mede Þou dost God a gret ffalshede. Þou hast don vs gret schame, Þou were wurþy to haue blame. Alle swylke werkes j reffuse, And þou, Sere Kyng, ?iff þou it vse, Þou dedyst nou?t as j þe bad! ?iff þou be efft in ffy?t bestad, Þou schalt ffynde hem euerylkon, Þey schole ben þy moste ffoon. ?yff þou haddyst hem alle slayn, Þenne my?tyst þou haue ben ffayn, And wunnen al þe good þerjnne. Now is it efft newe to begynne, And þat þyselff now schalt sen.” Quod Phelyþ: “J wole wende a?en Ffor to proue ?iff it be soþ; Wheþer þe ffolk me gyle doþ, Be aboute me to anoye, I schal hem brenne, sloo, and stroye; Þey schole neuere haue griþ.” Quod Richard: “?iff j wende þe wiþ, Þe betere hap þe may betyde.” On morwe þey begunne to ryde Wiþ here hoost to Taburet: Þe ffolk wiþjnne þe ?atys schet. Þey callyd: “Phelyp, ffeynte coward! Ffalse wrehche, þou broke fforeward! Þou gaff vs lyff ffor raunsoun: Þe tydes no more off þis toun Henne to þe worldes ende!” Quod Kyng Rychard: “Phelyp tak in mende! I sayde þe soþ, now may þou wete!” Anon hys baner doun þey smete, And brak it vp in gret despyt, To peces brak it al so tyt; And out into þe dyke it þrowen, And setten vp on off here owen, And bad hym: “Now doo þy beste!” Quod R.: “Ffrendes, haues no reste, Þis toun assayle we now swyþe; Euery man hys strengþe kyþe On þese dogges to ben wroken!” Whenne Kyng Richard þus hadde spoken, Þe Crystene-men gunne make a scryke: Anon þey wunnen ouyr þe dyke. Þe ffolk on þe walles aboue To deffende ffaste þey proue, Jn al þat þey may and cunne. Stones and stokkes þey þrewe dounne, Summe off þe Crystene þey herte; Ffor drede archeres a bak þane sterte. Þe Sarezynys þey gunnen grete, Arwys, quarellys þykke þey schete, And slowene þat þey ouyrtoke; Ouyr þe walles durste no mane loke. Þe Crystene þe walles vndyrmyn. Quod Richard: “I schal neuere syne Sytte on grounde, drynke, ne eeten, Tyl j haue þis toun jgeten.” In þe dyke þe wal ouyrþrewe; Þe hoost wan jn, and on hem hewe Wiþ swerdes, axes, and kene knyues, And slowen men, chyldren, and wyues. Þe hoost wolde no lengere be þare, Toward Archane gunne þey ffare. Þe ffolk off þe toun þe ?atys schet Kyng Phelyp out ffor to let, And sayden: “Coward, goo þy way! Here hast þou lost þy pray. Þou gaff vs lyff ffor tresore, Off þis toun tydes þe no more. Al at ones þy pay grap þou; Here hast þou lost þy lordschepe nowe! Þou art a ffals ffaynt wrehche! Hangyd be he þat off þe rehche! Al þat þou may doo vs, þou doo!” Ffor þat þey despysyd hym soo, Kyng Richard swoor, and was agreuyd: “Þe Sarezynes þerjnne, þat mysbeleuyd, Schal non off hem be sauyd quykke.” Arwes, quarelles fflowe þykke. Þe Crystene-men þe ?ates brente; Þey broke þe walles, and in þey wente. Þe Sarezynes fledden, awey gunne ffyken, Þe Crystene ffolwen, slen, and styken, And gaff alle here ffolk here bane; Þus Kyng Phelyp wan Archane. Quod R.: “Phelyp, tak to þe Þe goodes off ayþer cyte; Þus þou my?tyst haue don or þis. Certes, Phelyp, þou art nou?t wys. Þe be forgeuen þe ffyrste gylt: Þou may bewar, ?iff þat þou wylt.

Off gold schalt þou haue þy ffylle!” He gan to moorne, and heeld hym stylle; He glouryd, and gan to syke, Wiþ Kyng R. gan hym euyl lyke, Ffor wordes he gan to hym deyl. Kyng R. gan hym to counseyl: “Be trewe, doo as j þe teche! Goo we fforþ þis cuntre to seche, To sloo oure foos, and wynne þe croys!” Kyng Phelyp wiþouten noys Seyde: “In me schal be no delay To helpe þertoo þat j may!” Kyng R. and Phelyp wiþ here hoost Wenten fforþ be þe see-coost. Ageynes hem comen here naueye, Cogges, drowmoundes, many galeye, Barges, schoutes, crayeres ffele Þat were chargyd wiþ alle wele, Wiþ armure, and wiþ oþir vytaylle, Þat noþyng in þe hoost scholde ffayle. It was beffore Seynt James tyde Whenne ffoules begunne merye to chyde, Kyng Rycharde wente forth a pace Toward þe cyte off Cayphas, Euere forþ be þe maryn, Be þe reuer off Chalyn. Saladyn it herde telle, And come fflyngande afftyr snelle, Wiþ syxty þousand Sarezynes kene, And þou?te to doo Crystene-men tene; And ouyrtooke þe rerewarde, And begunne to bekyr harde. Hastely swerdes þey drowen, And many a Crystene-man þey slowen. Vnarmed was the rerewarde, And fledde in haste to Kyng Richarde. Whenne Kyng R. wyste þis, Þe Sawdon slow? hys men jwis, On Fauel of Cypre he sat ffalewe, Also swyfft as ony swalewe, In þis world at grete nede Was neuer founde a bettir stede. Hys baner anon was vnfolde, Þe Sarezynes gan it beholde. Þoo þey my?t þe baner see, Alle þey gunne ffor to fflee. Kyng Richard afftyr hem gan ryde, And þey wiþturnyd hem þat tyde, And smot togedere wiþ grete raundoun As ?iff al þe world scholde fall doun. Kyng R. beffore smot Wiþ hys ax, þat byttyrly boot, He hem hewed and tocarfe, Manye vndyr his hand þere starfe. Neuer was mane in erthe ryghte Þat better agaynes the Sarazenes gane fighte. And manye Crystene, j telle ?ow sekyr, Hente here deþ in þat bekyr Þorw? a carte þat was Hubertes Gawtyr, Þat was set in a myr. Saladynes sones theder came, And the harneys them bename. Þe cartere les his hand ry?t; Þere was slayn many a kny?t: Ffor þat harneys kepyd ffourty, And þeroff were jslayn þrytty. Kyng R. hyed þedyr wiþ þate, Yet almost he come to late! In his honde he helde hys ax good, Many Sarezyn he leet blood. One euerilke a syde hym he layde one, And slewe the Sarazyne full thikke wone. Þer was non armure, verraymente, So good þat my?te wiþstande his dent. And þe Longespay þat tyde Layde on be euery syde, Þat doun it wente al þat he smot Wiþ hys fawchoun, þat byttyr bot. And þe batayle was dotous, And to our ffolk wol perylous; Ffor þe hete was so strong, And þe dust ros hem among, And fforstoppyd þe Crystene onde, Þat þey ffylle ded vpon þe sonde. Moo dyede ffor hete at schorte wurdes Þenne for dent of spere or swordes. Kyng Richard was almost ateynt, And in þe pouder ny? adreynt. On hys knees he gan doun ffalle, Help! to Jhesu he gan calle, Ffor loue off his modyr Mary; And as j ffynde in his story, He sey? come Seynt George þe kny?t, Vpon a stede good and ly?t, In armes whyte as þe fflour Wiþ a croys off red colour. Al þat he mette in þat stounde, Hors and man he felde to grounde. And þe wynd gan wexe lyþe, Sterne strokes þey gynne to kyþe. Whenne Kyng R. sey? þat sy?t, In his herte he was glad and ly?t, And egyrly, wiþouten ffayle, Þe Sarezynes he gan assayle. Bertram Braundys, þe goode Lumbard, Robert Tourneham, and Kyng Richard, Alle þat agayn hem gan dryue, Soone þey reffte hem here lyue. Þe Sarezynes fledden to recet To þe mount of Nazareth. Þey were so hyyd at þe spore, Þat mekyl of here folk þey lore. Kyng R. wente a gret pas Toward þe cyte off Cayphas, And þankyd Jhesu, kyng off glorye, And Marye his modyr of þat victorie; And alle þey maden gret solas Ffor þe wynnyng off Cayphas. Soone on morowe he leet crye Among hys hoost, þat þey scholde hye Toward þe cyte of Palestyn, Euer forþ by þe maryn. Þere here pauylouns þey telte, And al to longe þere þey dwelte Ffor to abyde here vytayle, Þat comen by watyr, saun fayle. Certes, þat was þe werste dwellyng Þat euere dwellyd Richard oure kyng! Þat whyle þe Sawdon Saladyn Sente after many a Sarezyn To bete adoun þe castelles, Cytees, tounnes, and tourelles. Ffyrst þey bete doun þe castele That was callyd Myrabele; And afftyr þe castel Calaphyne, Þat was made off good engyne. Off Sesarye þey fellyd þe wal, And þe tour off Arsour al; Jaffe-castel þey bete adoun, And þe goode castel Touroun; Castel-Pylgrym þey ffelden þere, And þe goode castel Lafere; Þe castel off Seynt George de Reyn Þey ffelde doun, and made al pleyn. Þe walles þey ffelde off Ierusalem, And eke þe walles off Bedlem; Maydenes-castel þey lete stande, And þe castel off Aukes-lande. Be þat coost were no moo leten Þat þey ne were ffeld, and doun beten; And þis he dede wiþouten lette, For Richard scholde haue no recette. And whenne he hadde þus jdoo, Kyng Richard he sente vntoo, And seyde he wolde þe nexte morwe Mete hym in þe ffeld wiþ sorwe, And wiþ a launce to hym ryde, ?iff he durste hym abyde. Vndyr þe fforest off Arsour He wolde asaye hys valour. Kyng Richard made it nou?t tow?, But ffor þat tydyng ffaste he low?. He leet crye in hys hoost In þe name off þe Holy Gost Þat þey scholden wiþ vygour Þat ny?t reste before Arsour, And dy?ten hem al redy þan At morwen to ffy?te wiþ þe Sawdan. On Seynt Marye euen, þe natyuyte, Þis ylke bataylle scholde be. Many was þe heþene man Wiþ Saladyn þat come þan: Off Inde, off Perse, off Babyloyne, Off Arabye, and off Cessoyne, Off Aufryk, and off Bogye, Off al þe lond off Alysaundrye, Off Grete Grece, and off Tyre, And off many another empyre; Off moo landes þan ony can telle, Saue he þat made heuene and helle. That ny?t was R. before Arsour, Vndyr þe fforest of Lysour. Wiþ hym þer were off Yngeland Wyse kny?tes dou?ty off hand; Manye Ffrensche ffolk, and Templers, Gascoynes, and Hospytaleres, Off Provynce a fayr cumpanye, Off Poyle, and off Lumbardye, Off Gene, off Sesyle, and off Tuskan; Þere was many a dou?ty man Off Ostrych and off Alemayn, Þat weel cowde ffy?t in þe playn: Off Crystene kny?tes that were hende, Þe ffayreste hoost to þe worldes ende. And ?e schal here, as it is wrete, Hou þe batayle was jsmete. Saladyn com be a mountayn, And ouyrspradde hyl and playn. Syxty þousand sayde þe spye Came in þe ffyrste cumpanye, Wiþ longe speres, on heye stedes, Off gold and asure were here wedes. Syxty þousynd comen afftyrward Off Sarezynes stoute and hard Wiþ many a pensel off sykelatoun, And off sendel grene and broun. Almost come ffyue and ffyffty þousinde Wiþ Saladyn þat comen behynde; Þey comen alle stylle, and nou?t rende, Here armure ferde al as is brende. Þre þousand Turkes comen at þe laste Wiþ bowe Turkeys and arweblaste. A þousand taboures and ?it moo Alle at once þey smeten þoo, That al þe erþe donyd hem vndyr: Þere my?te men se grete wundir. Now speke we of Richard oure kyng Hou he com to batayle wiþ his gyng. He was armyd in splentes off steel, And sat vpon his stede Ffauel. Wel hym louede baroun and kny?t, Ffor he cowde weel ordayne a ffy?t. Þe ffyrste batayle to þe Templeres He gaff, and to þe Hospytaleres, And bad hem goo in Goddes name Þe ffeend to schentschepe and to schame. Jakes de Neys, and Jhon de Neles Beffore þey wenten in þat pres. Jn þis world þere ne were Betere kny?tes þenne þey were. Fforþ þey prekkyd, as j ffynde, Wiþ kny?tes fully twenty þousynde; And þe Sarezynes þey mette, Wiþ grymly launse þey hem grette. Many Sarezyn hadden here ffyn, And wenten to Mahoun and Appolyn; And þo þat cau?te deþ off oure, Wenten to Cryst oure Saueoure. Jakes de Neys was a noble kny?t, To slee the Sarasynes he dede his my?t. He prekyd beffore his ffolk to raþe Wiþ hys twoo sones, and þat was scaþe. Þre þousand Turkes come wiþ boost Betwen Jakes and hys hoost, Þat non help my?te come hym too, For no thyng þat þey myght doo; Ne he ne my?te hym wiþdrawe Ffor þe ffolk off heþene lawe. It was gret scaþe, be Jhesu Cryste, Kyng R. þeroff nou?t ne wyste, Ffor he was ?it al behynde To ordeyne twenty þousynde Þoo scholde þe Duke off Burgoyne Lede, and þe Erl of Boloyne. Þese comen, and deden here deuers Agayn þe heþene pawteners. And Jakes and hys sones twoo Almost weren jslayn þoo. He layde on euery syde ry?t, And steryd hym as noble kny?t. Twenty he slow?, and ayþer sone ten Off þe vyle heþene men; And nyne seþyn hys hors was ffelde, And euere he coueryd hym wiþ his schelde. He had non help off Templere, Ne off non oþir Hospytalere; Neuertheles doughtely he faught, The Sarasynes yet felde hym naught. He layde on wiþ his sworde, And euere he cryed: “Jhesu! Lorde! I schal dye ffor þy loue: Resseyue my soule to heuene aboue!” Þe Sarezynes layde on wiþ mace, And al toffrusschyd hym in þe place, Hym and hys sones boþe; Þerffore Kyng R. was ful wroþe. Whenne Kyng R. wyste þis, Þat ded was Jakes de Nys: “Allas,” he sayde, “Þis is wronge! Behynde j dwellyd al to longe!” He smot Ffauel wiþ spores off golde, Sewe hym þat sewe wolde. A launse in hys hand he heelde, He smot an amyral in þe scheelde. Þe dynt smot þorw? þe heþene herte, I vndyrstande it gan hym smerte. Kyng R. hys honde wiþdrow?, And wiþ þat launse a kyng he slow?; And so he dede an amyrayle, And ffyue dukes wiþouten ffayle. Wiþ þat ylke launse selue Kyng R. slow? kynges twelue. Þe þrytteneþe to þe chyn he kerff, Þe launse barst, þe Sarezyn sterff. Hys ax on his ffore-arsoun hyng, Anon it took Richard oure kyng. Some he smote on þe schuldyr-bon, And karff hym to þe sadyl anon; And of som he pared so þe croune, Þat helme and hed fel adoune. Non armure jwrou?t wiþ hande My?te Kyng Richardes ax wiþstande. Off my tale bes nou?t awundryd: Þe Ffrenssche says he slow? an hundrid, Whereof is maad þis Ynglyssche sawe, Or he reste hym ony þrawe. Hym ffolewyd many an Ynglyssche kny?t, Þat egyrly halp hym for to ffy?t, And layden on as þey were woode Tyl valeys runnen al on bloode. Þe Sarezynes sayden in here pauylouns Þe Crystene ferden as lyouns, And that Rycharde with theyr folke fares As grehoundes do with hares. Vpon here steedes manly þey lepen, Swerdes and speres to them þey grepen. Manye man þere slow? oþir, Many a Saresyn loste þere his broþir, And manye off þe heþene houndes Wiþ here teeþ gnow? þe groundes. By þe blood vpon þe gras Men my?te see where Richard was! Brayn and blood he schadde jnow?, Many an hors hys guttes drow?. Þere was manye an empty sadyl, Þat it bewepte þe chyld in the cradyl. He þou?te rescue Jakes de Nayn, And ar he come he was jslayn, Ffor he and hys sones anon Were toffrusschyd flesch and bon. He ledde hym to hys pauyloun Jn despyt of here God Mahoun. Þoo fought Richard on ylke a syde, Þe Sarezynes durste no lengere abyde. Syxe þousand and seuene score At onys he droff hym before Vp agayn an hy? cleue; Þey ffledde as deer þat were dreue, And ffor the drede off Kyng Richard Off þe clyff þey fell dounward, And al tobarste hors and man, Þat neuere non com to lyue þan. Þat sey? þe Sawdon Saladyn; He was fful sekyr hys lyff to tyn. He lefte hys pauyloun and hys tente, And fledde away verramente. Whenne Kyng Richard sey? hym fleande, He sewyd afftyr ffaste flyngande. To sloo þe Sawdon was hys þou?t, But, ffor he my?t hym ouertake nou?t, Off a ffootman a bowe he took, And drow? an arwe vp to þe hook, And sente it to þe Sawdon anon, And smot hym þorw? the schuldyr-bon. Þus þe Sawdon wiþ dolour Ffledde ffro þe batayle off Arsour. Syxty þousand þere were slawe Sarezynys off heþene lawe, And off Crystene but ten score: Blyssyd be Jhesu Cryst þerffore! Kyng Richard took þe pauylouns Off cendeles and off sykelatouns; Þey were schape as castelles, Off gold and syluyr were þe penseles. Manye was þe noble geste Þeron was wryten of wylde beste: Tygrys, dragouns, leouns, lupard: Al þis wan þe Kyng Richard. Bounden coffres and grete males He hadde þere wiþouten tales. Off tresore þey hadde so mekyl wone, Þey wyste neuer where here goodes to done. Kyng Richard wente wiþ honour Into þe cyte off Arsour, And restyd hym þere al þat ny?t, And þanked Jhesu ful of my?t. On the morowe Kynge Rycharde ros— Hys dedes were riche and his los—, Off Naples he callyd Sere Gawter, Þat was his maystyr Hospitaler, And bad hym take wiþ hym kny?tes, Stoute in armes, stronge in ffy?tes, And agayn to þe ffeelde tee Þere þe batayle hadde jbee, And lede Jakes þe baroun Jnto Jerusalem toun, And berye his body þere in erþe, For he was a man wel werþe. Al was don wiþouten cheste, Hastyly Kyng Richardes heste. Þus Kyng Richard wan Arsour, God graunte hys soule mekyl honour! At morwen he sente to þe Kyng off Fraunce, And sayde to hym wiþouten bobaunce: “Wende we to Nynyue, Þat is a swyþe strong cite. Ffor hadde we þat toun jwunne, Þenne were oure game ffayre bigunne. Hadde we þat and Massedoyne, We scholde wende to Babyloyne. Þenne my?te we saffly ryde An hundryd myle by ylke a syde.” Richard and Phylyp in Arsour lay: A messanger þenne come to say Þat þe Sarezynes wolde abyde, And in batayle to hem ryde, In þe pleyn Odok, soþe to seye; Þere þey wele leue or deye. Kyng Richard hem answerid anon: “J schal ?ow telle, by Seynt Jhon, And j wiste what day it wore, J scholde mete wiþ hym þore!” Þe messanger sayde, by his lay, Þat it scholde be on þe seuenyþe day. Þat tyme come, as he telde, The Sarezynes comen into þe ffeelde Wiþ syxty þousand and weel moo. Kyng Richard come ageynes hem þoo. Hys hoost he delte in ffoure manere, As þey sayde þat þer were: Ffouke Doyly be þat on syde, Thomas be þat oþir to abyde, Kyng Phelyp þe þrydde part, And þe fforþe Kyng Richard. Þus þey besette hem wiþoute, Þe Sarezynes þat were bolde and stoute. Jn euery hoost Crystene-men Sarezynes baners outputte þen. Þe Sarezynes wenden þenne anon Þey hadde ben Sarezynes euerylkon. Soone so Richard sey? þis, Þat þe Sarezynys hoost beclosyd is, His owne baner was soone arerde: Þenne were þe Sarezynes sore aferde, And abaschyd hem in a þrowe. Þe Crystene gan þe baner to knowe, Þey smeten on in þat stounde, And slow? many an heþyn hounde. Kyng Richard vpon Fauel gan ryde, And slow? dounry?t on ylke a syde, And alle his ffolk dede alsoo, Alle ffoure hostes layden too, Many Sarezyn þey schente. Allas, an hoost ffrom hem wente; By þe kynges syde off Ffraunce, Þe hoost passyd by a chaunce Into Nynyue agayn þoo: Þerfore was Kyng Richard woo. Þe Sarezynys þat þey ffounde þore, Þey ?ede to deþe, lesse and more. Þe numbre þat þer to deþe ?ede, Ffyfftene þousand, as j ?ow rede. Kyng Richard wente wiþ his meyne Toward þe cyte off Nynyue; Kyng Phelyp wente hym by Wiþ a gret hoost, sykerly, Tyl þey come to Nynyue, And tylde here pauylouns besyde þe cyte. Kyng Richard on morwen whenne it was day, To armes he comaunded alle þat may, And hastyly, wiþouten pytee, To assayle þat cyte, Wiþ arweblast and wiþ oþer gynne, ?iff þey my?te þe cyte wynne. Alle þe folk wiþouten chydyng, Dede Kyng Richardys byddyng. Þe gynours mangeneles bente, And stones to þe cyte þey sente; Harde stones in þey þrewe, Þe Sarezynes þat wel knewe. Arweblast off vys wiþ quarrel, Wiþ staff-slynges þat smyte wel, Wiþ trepeiettes þey slungen alsoo, Þat wrou?te hem ffol mekyl woo; And blew wylde ffyr in trumpes of gynne, To mekyl sorewe to hem wiþjnne. Now sey? þe Sarezynes ylkone Þat þey scholde to deþ gone. A messanger anon þey sente; To Kyng R. fforþ he wente, And prayed ?iff hys wylle be, Off batayle betwen þre; Þree off hem and þree off hys: Wheþer off hem þat wynne þe prys, And who þat haues þe heyere hand, Haue þe cyte and al here land, And haue it ffor eueremore. Kyng Richard grauntyd hem þore, And bad hem come hastyly. Þe messanger wente in on hy, And sayde to þe amyrayle Þat Kyng Richard, wiþouten ffayle, Weel armyd wiþ spere and scheelde, Wolde meten hem in þe ffeelde, And wiþ hym oþere twoo barouns, Noble men off gret renouns, Ffor to ffy?te wiþ swylke þree As ?e wole sende off þis cytee. Þenne on rabytes were þey dy?t, Þree amyralles, bolde and wy?t. Here names j schal ?ow telle anon, What þey hy?te euerylkon: Sere Archolyn in ffyrst rod, Coudyrbras houyd and abode, Sere Galabre houyd stylle To see who wolde ryde hym tylle. Kyng Richard, þe noble kny?t, Agayn Sere Archolyn hym dy?t. Þey smeten togedere dyntys sare; He ne schal keuere neuere mare! And he gaff Richard a sory fflatt Þat ffoundryd bacynet and hat. Kyng Richard was agreuyd sore Ffor þe strok þat he hadde þore. Kyng R. took his ax fful strong, And on þe Sarezyn faste he dong On þe helm aboue þe crown; He cleff hym to þe sadyl-arsoun. Hys lyff fforsoþe nou?t longe lest, Ffor Kyng R. was his preeste. Sere Cowderbras fforþ gan ryde; Sere Thomas þou?te hym to abyde. Þey reden togedere, as we rede, Þat boþe to þe erþe þey ?ede. Vp þey styrte in þat stounde, And smeten togeder wiþ grym wounde. Þey ffou?ten fful sore wiþ fawchouns kene, Strong batayle was hem bytwene. Cowderbras ffor ffelonye Smot Sere Thomas, wiþouten lye, On his spawdeler off his scheelde, Þat it fley? into þe ffeelde. Thomas was agreuyd sore, And þou?te to anoye hym more. He took to hym hys mase off bras, Þat ffaylyd hym neuere in no cas, And gaff hym a sory weffe, Þat his helme al tocleffe, And al tobrosyd his herne-panne: Kyd he was a dou?ty manne. Out off hys sadyl he hym glente, And wiþ þe rabyte forþ he wente. Sere Galabre houyd stylle To see who wolde ryde hym tylle. He nyste wheþir hym was most gayn Ffor to ffy?te, or turne agayn. Sere Ffouke Doyly weel it say, Loþ hym were he scapyd away. To hym he prekyd vpon a stede, Agayn hym þat oþir ?ede; Wiþ egyr jre togedere rode, Þat eyþere stede to grounde glode, And brak here nekkes in þat stounde, Þat þey lay ded vpon þe grounde. Here speres scheueryd in þe ffeeldes, So eyþir hytte oþir in þe scheeldes. Eyþer gaff oþir strokes ffelle, Dere þey gunne here lyues selle. Galabre was stout and wy?t, Þat Ffouke ne my?te hym hytte nou?t ry?t, But at þe laste he gaff hym on, Þat he brak his schuldre-bon, And hys on arme þertoo: Þenne was hys ffy?tyng doo. On knees he fyl doun, and cryde: “Creaunt, Ffor Mahoun and Termagaunt!” But Sere Ffouke wolde nou?t soo; Þe hed he smot þe body ffroo. Þe lordynges off þat cyte Agayn hem comen, and fellen on kne, And þe keyes wiþ hem þey brou?te, Off mercy Kyng R. besou?te; ?iff he wolde saue here lyff, Þey wolde be crystenyd, man and wyff, And wenden wiþ hym, wiþouten fayle, In þe brest off euery bataylle, And off hym holden þat cyte. Kyng Richard grauntyd wiþ herte ffree. A bysschop he leet come anon, And dede hym crystene euerylkon. Lytyl, mekyl, lasse, and more, In þat tyme crystenyd wore. Kyng R. a whyle þere leffte stylle, Þe comounners seruyd hym at wylle; Off alle þat he wiþ hym brou?te, Betere my?te þay serue hym nou?te. The cheff Sawdon of Heþenysse To Babyloyne was flowen jwysse. His counseyl he offsente þat tyme, Þere semblyd many a bold paynyme. Syxty þousand þere were telde Off gylte spores in þe ffeelde, Wiþouten ffootmen and putayle, Þat þer come into batayle. As he sayde þat was þe spye Þat tolde þe ffolk on boþe partye, Twoo hundrid þousand of heþene men To batayle hadde þe Sawden. Lystnys lordes, ?ungge and olde, Ffor his loue þat Judas solde! Þe men þat loue treweþe and ry?t, Euere he sendes hem strengþe and my?t: Þat was þere fful weel sene. Oure Crystene hoost, wiþouten wene, Was no mo, in booke j fynde, In all but ffoure score þousynde. Kyng R. þrytty þousande ladde, Ffor Phelyp and hys men were badde. Ffyffty þousand hadde hee By þat on syde off þat cytee To kepe wiþjnne þe Sarezynes stoute, Was non so bold to passen oute: For R. on þat oþir syde lay, On batayll redy euery day, Wiþ mangenel and wiþ spryngeles, Wiþ manye arewes and quarelles. There was no Sarezyn so stoute, That ouyr þe walles durst loken oute. Þe cyte was so strong wiþjnne, Þat no man my?te vnto hem wynne. Our stronge engynes, ffor þe nones, Broken þe walles wiþ harde stones, Here ?atys, and here barbycan. Be ?e sekyr, þe heþene man Made encountre hard and strong, Þat manye a man was slayn among. Ffor hadde Kyng Phelyp trewe bee At the sege of þat cytee, There had neuer jscaped no man, Heþene kyng, ne sawdan, Þat þey ne hadde be slayn dounry?t: Ffor Kyng R. ever vpon þe ny?t Whenne þe sunne was gon to reste, Wiþ hys hoost he wolde be preste, Gaff þe bataylle hard and smerte, Þat no paynym my?te wiþsterte, And slow? hem doun gret plente, And wylde fyr caste into þe cytee. Þe Sarezynes deffendyd hem faste Wiþ bowe Turkeys and arweblaste. Hard fy?t was hem bytwene, So sayde þay þat dyde it sene. Quarellys, arwes also þykke gan flye, As it were poudyr in þe skye; And wylde ffyr þe ffolk to brenne. A counsayl took þe heþene menne To ffy?te wiþ hem in þe ffeelde; Þey wolde nou?t þe cyte ?elde. Off Kyng Richard my?te þey nou?t spede To take trewes ffor no nede. “Ffor no þyng,” sayde Richard þan, “Tyl j haue slawe þe Sawdan, And brend þat is in þe cytee!” The lateniere þo turnyd a?ee To þat oþer syde off þe toun, And cryede trewes wiþ gret soun To þe riche Kyng off Ffraunce; And he hem grauntyd wiþ myschaunse, Ffor a porcyoun off golde; And ellys hadde þe toun be ?olde, And alle þe Sarezynes jslayn. But þenne was the Sowdan fful ffayne, And alle his folk on R. ffylle, For þat oþir syde was stylle. Kyng R. wende þat Phelip ffou?te, And he and hys men dede nou?te, But maden hem merye al þat ny?te, And weren traytours in þat ffy?te. He louyd no crownes ffor to crake, But doo tresoun, and tresore take. Kyng Phelyp to R. sende Þat he my?te hym no lengere deffende; Ffor hungyr he and his men alsoo Moste breke sege, and goo. Sory was Kyng R. þan, And sayde: “Traytour! ffalse man! Ffor couaytyse off tresour He dos hymselff gret dyshonour Þat he schal Sarezynes respyt gyue; Jt is harme þat swylke men lyue!” He brekes sege, and gynnes to wiþdrawe. Þenne were þe Sarezynes wundyr fawe, Gret ioye made hem among, Carollyd, trumpyd, and merye song. The nexte day afftyr þan Messangeres comen fro þe Sawdan, And grette R. in this manere, And sayden: “Sere, ?iff þy wyl were, My lord, þe Sawdon, to þe sente, ?iff þou wylt graunte in presente: Þou art strong of fflesch and bones, And he is dou?ty ffor þe nones; Þou dost hym gret harme, he says, And destroyyst hys countrays, Slees hys men, and eetes among. Al þat þou werres, it is wiþ wrong. Þou crauyst herytage in þis lande, And he dos þe weel to vndyrstande Þat þou hast þertoo no ry?t! Þou sayst þy God is fful off my?t— Wylt þou graunte wiþ spere and scheelde To derayne þe ry?t in þe ffelde, Wiþ helme, hawberk, and brondes bry?t, On stronge stedes, goode and ly?t, Wheþer is off more power, Jhesu, or ells Jubyter? And he sente þe to saye þis, ?iff þou wylt haue an hors off his? In alle þe landes þere þou hast gon, Swylk on say þou neuere non! Ffauuel of Cypre, ne Lyard off prys, Are nou?t at nede as þat he is; And, ?iff þou wylt, þis selue day It schal be brou?t þe to asay.” Kyng R. answered: “Þou sayst weel! Swylke an hors, by Seynt Michel, J wolde haue to ryden vpon, Ffor myn are wery and fforgon; And j schal ffor my lordes loue, Þat syttes hey?e in heuene aboue, And hys owne hors be good, Wiþ a spere schede hys blood. ?yff þat he wole graunte and holde Jn þis manere þat þou hast tolde, As j moste God my soule ?elde, J schal meten hym in þe ffeelde. Bydde hym sende þat hors to me; And j schal asaye what he bee. ?yff he be trusty, wiþoute ffayle, I kepe non oþir into batayle.” Þe messanger þenne hom wente, And tolde þe Sawdon in presente That R. in þe felde wolde hym mete. Þe ryche Sawdon also skete A noble clerk he sente ffore þen, A maystyr nigromancien, Þat coniuryd, as j ?ow telle, Þorw? þe ffeendes crafft off helle Twoo stronge ffeendes off þe eyr In lyknesse off twoo stedes ffeyr, Lyke boþe of hewe and here; As þay seyde þat were þere, Neuere was þer sen non slyke. Þat on was a mere lyke, Þat oþer a colt, a noble stede. Where that he were, in ony nede, Was neuere kyng ne kny?t so bolde Þat whenne þe mere ney?e wolde, Scholde hym holde agayn his wylle, Þat he ne wolde renne here tylle, And knele adoun, and souke hys dame: Therwhyle þe Sawdon wiþ schame Scholde Kyng R. aquelle. Al þus an aungyl gan hym telle, Þat come to hym aboute mydny?t, And sayde: “Awake, þou Goddes kny?t! My Lord dos þe to vndyrstande That þe schal come an hors to hande; Ffaire he is off body py?te, To betraye þe ?iff þe Sawdon my?te. On hym to ryde haue þou no drede; He schal þe helpe at þy nede. Purueye a tree, grete and strong, Þou? it be ffourty ffoote long, And trusse it ouyrthwert his mane: Alle þat he metes, schal haue his bane, Wiþ þat tree he schal doun ffelle. It is a ffeend as j þe telle; Ryde vpon hym in Goddes name, Ffor he may doo þe no schame. Tak a brydyl,” þe aungyl seyde, “And mak it ffast vpon hys hede, And be þe brydyl in his mouþ Þou schalt turne hym norþ and souþ. He schal þe serue at þy wylle When þe Sawdon rydes þe tylle; Haue here a spere-hed off steel: He has non armure jwrou?t soo weel Þat it ne wole perce be thou bolde.” Whenne the aungell hadde þus jtold, Agayn to heuene he is wente. At morwen þe hors was to hym sente. Kyng Richard off þe hors was blyþe, And dy?te hym a sadyl swyþe. Boþe his arsouns weren off yren, Ffor þey scholde be stronge, and dyren. Wiþ a cheyne he gyrde hym ffaste, A brydyl vpon his hed he caste, As þe aungyll hadde hym tau?t. Twoo goode hokes fforgat he nau?t In hys arsoun he sette beffore, Wiþ wax he stoppyd his eeres þore, And sayde: “Be þe aposteles twelue, Þou? þou be þe deuyl hymselue, Þou schalt me serue at þis nede! He þat on þe roode gan blede, And suffryd grymly woundes ffyue, And siþþen ros ffrom deþ to lyue, And bou?te mankynde out off helle, And siþþen þe fendes pouste gan felle, And afftyr stey? vp into heuene, Now God, for his names seuene, Þat ilke God in persones thre, Jn his name j comaunde þe Þat þou serue me at my wylle!”— He schook his hed, and stood ful stylle. Kyng Rychard made hym redy that nyght. At morwen when it was day-ly?t, Syxe sawdones wiþ gret route Off þe cytee comen oute, And batayllyd hem on a ryuer, Wiþ brode scheeldes and helmes cler. Þat day was told, wiþouten lesynges, Off sawdons and off heþene kynges An hondryd and ?it wel moo; Þe leste brou?t wiþ hym þoo Twenty þousande and ?it ten. Agayn on off oure Crystene-men Þere were a doseyn be þe leste. The oste ferde as a foreste. Of Sarezynes was so gret an hoost, Weel a ten myle a coost. Þey made scheltroun, and batayle byde; Messangerys betwen gan ryde, To Kynge Phelyp and Kyng Richard, ?iff þey wolde holde foreward þat þey made þe day beffore. Þe Sarezynes fful redy wore; Þree hundryd þousand þer bee; Kyng R. lokyd, and gan to see; As snow? lygges on þe mountaynes Behelyd were hylles and playnes Wiþ hawberkes bry?te and helmes clere. Off trumpes and off tabourere To here þe noyse it was grete wundyr; As þou? þe world aboue and vndyr Scholde ffalle, so fferde þe soun! Oure Crystene-men made hem boun; Kyng R. hem noþyng ne dradde, To his men “has armes” he gradde, And sayde: “Ffelawes, for þe roode, Looke ?e ben off coumfort goode! And ?iff we gete þe prys þis day, Off Heþenesse al þe nobelay Ffor eueremore we haue wunne: Ffor he þat made mone and sunne Be oure help, and gyue vs my?t! Beholdes hou myselff schal ffy?t Wiþ swerde, spere, and ax off steel; But j þis day mete hem weel, Euermore ffro henne fforeward Holdes me for a ffeynt coward! But euery Crystene-man and page, Haue þis ny?t vnto his wage An hed off a Sarezyn Þorw? Goddes help and alsoo myn! Swylk werk j schal among hem make, Off þo þat j may ouyrtake, Þat ffro þis tyme to domysday Þey schole speke off my pay.” Oure Crystene-men were armyd weel, Boþe in yryn and in steel. Þe kyng off Ffraunce wiþ his batayle, Was redy þe Sarezynes to asayle. Aboue þe Sarezynes þey ryden, And scheltroun py?ten, and batayle abyden, And fforstoppyd þe lande-wayes. Þey my?te nou?t fflee in þe countrayes, Ne no socour to hem come, But ?iff þey were slayn or nome. Þe Ffrenssche gunne blowe bost and make To sloo Sarezynes, and crownes crake, But in ieste as it is tolde There was non off hem so bolde To breke þe Sarezynes scheltrome, Tyl Kyng R. was jcome. Now sewyd Richard wiþ his hoost, And closyd hem by anoþir coost, Betwyxen hem and þe cyte, Þat no Sarezyn my?te fflee. Þenne hadde Richard hoostes þree: Þat on gaff asawt to þe cytee, Þe oþere twoo wiþ hym he ladde. To bryngen hym his hors he badde Þat þe Sawdon hadde hym sent. He sayde: “Wiþ hys owne present, I schal hym mete longe or ny?t.” To lepe to horse þo was he dy?t. Jnto þe sadyl or he leep, Off manye þynges he took keep. Hym lakkyd nou?t þat he ne hadde, Hys men hym brou?te al þat he badde. A quarry tree off ffourty ffoote Before his sadyl anon dede hote Ffaste þat men scholde it brase, Þat it ffaylyd ffor no case. And so þey dede wiþ hookes of yren, And good rynges that wolde duren. Oþer ffestnynge non þer was Þen yryne cheynes ffor alle cas, And they were jwrou?t ful weel. Boþe his gerthes and his peytrel, A qweyntyse off þe kynges owen, Vpon hys hors was jþrowen, Beffore hys arsoun his ax off steel, By þat oþer syde his masuel. Hymselff was richely begoo, Ffrom þe crest vnto þe too. He was armyd wondyr weel, And al wiþ plates off good steel, And þer aboue an hawberk; A schafft wrou?t off trusty werk; On hys schuldre a scheeld off steel, Wiþ þree lupardes wrou?t fful weel. An helme he hadde off ryche entayle; Trysty and trewe was his ventayle; On his crest a douve whyte, Sygnificacyoun off þe Holy Speryte; Vpon a croys þe douue stood, Off gold wrou?t riche and good. God hymselff, Marye, and Jhon, As he was naylyd þe roode vpon, In signe off hym for whom he fau?t. Þe spere-hed fforgatt he nau?t, Vpon his shafte he wolde it haue; Goddes hy?e name þeron was graue. Now herkenes what oþ þey swore Ar þey to þe batayle wore: ?yff it were soo þat Richard my?te Sloo þe Sowdon in ffeeld wiþ ffy?t, Hee and alle hese scholde gon, At here wylle euerylkon, Into þe cyte off Babyloyne, And þe kyngdome off Massedoyne He scholde haue vndyr his hand, And ?iff þe Sawdon off þat land My?te sloo Richard in the ffeeld, Wiþ swerd or spere vndyr scheeld, Þat Crysten-men scholde goo Out off þat land ffor eueremoo, And Sarezynes hauen her wylle in wolde. Quod Kyng R.: “Þerto j holde, Þertoo my gloue, as j am kny?t!” Þey ben armyd, and redy dy?t; Kyng R. into þe sadyl leep. Whoo þat wolde take keep, To see þat sy?te it was ffayr. Þe stedes ran wiþ gret ayr Al so harde as þey my?te dure, Afftyr here ffeet sprong þe ffure. Tabours beten, and trumpes blowe; Þere my?te men see in a þrowe How Kyng R., þe noble man, Encountryd wiþ þe Sawdan, Þat cheef was told off Damas. Hys trust vpon his mere was. Þerffore, as þe book vs telles, Hys crouper heeng al ful off belles, And hys peytrel, and his arsoun: Þree myle men my?ten here þe soun. His mere gan ny?e, here belles to ryng, Ffor gret pryde, wiþouten lesyng. A brod ffawchoun in honde he bar, Ffor he þou?te he wolde þar Haue slayn Kyng R. wiþ tresoun, Whenne his hors hadde knelyd doun As a colt þat scholde souke; And he was war off þat pouke. Hys eeres wiþ wex were stoppyd ffaste, Þerffore R. was nou?t agaste. He strok þe ffeend þat vndyr hym ?ede, And gaff þe Sawdon a dynt off dede. In hys blasoun, verrayment, Was jpayntyd a serpent. Wiþ þe spere þat R. heeld, He bar hym þorw? vndyr þe scheeld. None off hys armes my?te laste; Brydyl and paytrel al tobrast; Hys gerþes, and hys styropes alsoo; His mere to þe grounde gan goo. Mawgry hym he garte hym stoupe Bakward ouyr his meres croupe; His feet toward þe ffyrmamente. Behynde hym þe spere out wente. He leet hym lye vpon þe grene, He smote þe ffeend wiþ spores kene; In þe name off þe Holy Gost, He dryues into þe heþene hoost; And also soone as he was come, He brak asundry þe scheltrome; Ffor al þat euere beffore hym stode, Hors and man to grounde ?ode, Twenty ffoote on euery syde. Whom þat he ouertoke þat tyde, Off lyff ne was there waraunt non. Þorw?out he made hys hors to gon. As bees swarmen abowte þe hyues, The Crystene-men in afftyr dryues, Stryke þorw? þat doun lygges, Þorw? þe myddel and þe rygges. Whenne þey off Ffraunce wysten Þat þe maystry hadde þe Crysten, Þey were bolde, and gode herte took, Stedes prekyd, and schafftes schook. Þe Kyng Phelyp wiþ a spere An heþene kyng gan doun bere; And oþere eerles and barouns, Stronge men off grete renouns, Slowen þe Sarezynes dounry?t. Off Yngelond many a noble kny?t Wrou?te weel þere þat day. Off Salysbury the Longespay To grounde he ffeelde wiþ his brond Alle þat he beffore hym ffond; Next Kyng R. euere he was, And off Multon Sere Thomas, Ffouk Doyly, Robert Leycetre, In Crystenedom þer were non betre. Where þat ony off hem come, Þey sparyd neyþer lord ne grome, Þat þey ne dreuen alle adoun. The Sarezynes þat weren wiþjnne þe toun, Ffor gret sorwe þat þey seyn, Þey wepte wiþ boþe here eyen, And “Mercy!” lowde þenne þey cryde. Þey wolden kaste vppe the ?ates wyde, And lete hem at here wyl in come. Þe Crystene haue þe cyte nome. Anon hastely wiþalle Þey setten baners on þe walle, Þe kynges armes off Yngelande. Whenne Saladyn gan vndyrstande Þat þe cyte ?olden was, He gan to crye “Allas, allas! Þe prys off heþenesse is done!” And gan to flee also soone, And fayn alle þoo þat my?te. And Kyng R., þat noble kny?te, Whenne he sey? þe Sawdon fley?: “Abyde, coward!” he cryede on hey?, “And j schal þe prouen ffals, And þy cursede goddes als.” Kyng R. dryues afftyr ffast; Þe Sawdon was ful sore agast; A gret wode beffore hym he sees, Þedyr in wol ffaste he fflees. Kyng R. wente þe wode nere, He doutyd of encumbrere, He my?te nou?t in for his tree; Sone he tourned his horse aye, And mette wiþ an heþene kyng. He took his ax out off þe ryng, And hytte hym vpon þe crest, And cleff hym doun vnto þe brest. Anoþir he rau?te vpon þe scheeld, Þat helme and hed ffley? into þe ffeeld. Syxe he slow? off heþene kynges, To telle þe soþe in alle þynges; In þe ieste as j ffynde Þat moo þan syxty þousynde Off empty stedes abouten ?ode, Vp to þe ffeetlakkes in þe bloode. Astray þay ?eden wiþ grete pryde, What man wolde myght ryde. Þe batayle laste tyl it was ny?t; But whenne þey had jslayn dounry?t Þe Sarezynes that þey my?te ouyrtake, Gret ioye gan þe Crystene make, They knelyd, and þankyd God off heuene, And wurschepyd hym, and hys names seuene. On boþe sydes wer ffolk slawe: But þe numbre off þe Crystene lawe Þat lay ded in þe ffeelde, To God þey gunne theyr soules ?elde. Þere were slawen hundredes þree; Off Sarezynes was þer more plente, Syxty þousand, and ?it moo. Loo, swylke grace God sente þoo! Þe Crystene to þe cyte gon; Off gold, and syluyr, and precyous ston Þey ffounde jnow? wiþouten ffayle, Mete, and drynk, and oþir vytayle. At morwen, whenne Kyng R. aros— Hys dedes were noble and his los— Sarezynes beffore hym come, And askyd of hym Crystyndome. Þere were crystenyd, as j ffynde, More þan ffourty þousynde. Kyrkes þey maden off Crystene lawe, And here Mawmettes leet doun drawe; And tho þat wolden nou?t Crystene become, Richard leet slen hem, alle and some, And departyd þe gret tresour Among þe Crystene wiþ honour: Erl, baroun, kny?t, and knaue, Had as mekyl as þey wolde haue. Þere þey soiournyd ffourtene ny?t. On a day þey haue hem dy?t, Toward Ierusalem gunne þey ryde. Kyng Phelyp spak a wurd off pryde: “Kyng R., lystene to me; Ierusalem, þat ryche cyte, Þou? þou it wynne it schal be myn.” “By God,” quod Richard, “and Seynt Austyn, And as God doo my soule boote, Off my wynnyng nou?t halff a ffoote Þou ne schalt haue off no lande, I doo þe weel to vndyrstande! And ?iff þou wylt haue it,” he seyde þen, “Goo, and gete it wiþ þy men! Myn offeryng,” quod R., “loo it here! I wyl come þe cyte no nere!” An arweblast off vys he bente, A ffloryng to þe cyte he sente: Þat was in signifyaunce Ihesu Cryste to honouraunce. For yre become syke þe kyng off Ffraunce; Þe leche sayde wiþouten dystaunce Þat he my?te nou?t hool ben, But he to Ffraunce wolde turne a?en. Þe kyng hys counsayl vndyrstood, And sayd it was trewe and good. His schyppes he dy?te more and lesse, And wente home at Alhalewe-messe. Kyng R. on hym gan crye, And sayde he ded gret velonye To wende hom ffor maladye Out off þe lond off Surrye Tyl don were Goddes servyse, Ffor lyff or deþ, in ony wyse. Þe kyng of Ffraunce wolde hym nou?t here, But departyd in þis manere; And afftyr þat þartyng, forsoþe, Euere ?it þey were wroþe. Kyng R. wente wiþ his hoost To Jaffe, wiþouten bost, Þe kynges pauyloun faire and fyne He leete tylde in on gardyn. Oþere lordes gan aboute sprede Here pauyloun in a ffayr mede. Kyng R. wiþ his meyne alle Off þe cyte leet make þe walle, Þat neuere was non in Sarezyneys So strong wrou?t, and off gret ryhcheys. Þat castel was strong and ryche, Jn þe world was non it lyche. Þedyr my?te come be þe see Off euery good gret plente. He made here warde of noble kny?tes, Stoute in armes, stronge in ffy?tes. Jnowe men my?te wende aboute Manye myle wiþouten doute. Kyng R. dwellyd wiþ honoure, Tyl þat Jaffe was maad al sure. Fro þennes to Chaloyn þey wente, And fond þe walles al torente. Mekill and ffayr was þat cyte; Kyng R. þeroff hadde pyte. He besou?te þe lordes alle, Off þe cyte to make þe walle; And he wolde make the halfendele By hymselfen, fynly and wele. And þe lordes euerylkon Grauntyd hym hys askyng anon, Saue þe duke off Ostryke, Kyng R. he þou?te to beswyke. Kyng R. gan to trauayle Aboute þe walles, without fayle! So þey dede, on and oþir; Ffadyr and sone, eme and broþir, Made morter, and layde ston, Wiþ here my?t, euerylkon. Euery kyng and emperere Stones bare or mortere, Saue þe duke, fful off prede, He ne wolde hem helpe for no nede. Vpon a day R. hym mette, And hendely þe kyng hym grette, And bad hym, for hys curteysye, Make off þe walles hys partye; And he answeryd in þis manere: “My fadyr nas mason ne carpentere; And þou? ?oure walles al toschake, I schal neuere helpe hem to make.” Kyng R. pekyd gret errour, Wraþþe dede hym chaunge colour; Þe duke agayn þe brest he smot Wiþ hys ffoot, God it wot, Þat on a ston he ouyrþrewe: It was euyl don be Seynt Mathewe! “Ffy! a debles, foule coward! In helle be þou hangyd hard! Goo quyckly out of this hoost; The curs hast þou off þe Holy Goost! By the sydes of swete Ihesus, Ffynde j þe, traytour, among vs, Ouyr þis ylke dayes þre, Myself schal þy bane bee. Traytour, we trauayle day and ny?t In werre, in wakyng, and in ffy?t, And þou lys as a foule glotoun, And restes þe in þy pauyloun, And drynkes wyn, good and strong, And slepes al þe ny?t long. I schal breke þy banere, And caste it into þe reuere!” Home wente þe duke fful wroþ, Hys owne lyff hym wax loþ. Off þat despyte he was vnblyþe, And trussyd hys harneys al so swyþe, And swor by Jhesu in Trynyte, And he my?te euere his tyme see, He scholde of Richard hym so awreke, Þat al þe world þeroff scholde speke. He heeld hym al to weel fforward: In helle be he hangyd hard! Þorw? hys tresoun and trehcherye, And þorw? þe waytyng off a spye, Kyng R. he dede gret schame, Þat turnyd al Yngelond to grame. A lytyl lengere hadde he most Haue leuyd, ffor þe Holy Gost, Ouyr kyng, duke, and emperour, He hadde be lord and conquerour. Al Crystendom and al Paynym Scholde haue holden vndyr hym. Þe Duke off Ostrych hyyd hym faste Away wiþ his meyne in haste. Wiþ hym þe Duke off Burgoyne, Þe ffolk off Ffraunce, and þe Eerl of Boloyne. Kyng R. let breke his baner, And keste it into þe reuer, And cryyd on hym wiþ voys stepe: “Home, schrewe! coward! and slepe! Come no more in no wyse Neuere efft in Goddes seruyse!” Þe duke awey prekyd þenne, Ffor wrathe his herte began to brenne. Kyng R. leffte wiþ hys Englys, Tuskaynes, Lumbardes, Gascoynes jwis, Scottes, Yrysch, ffolk of Bretayne, Gennayes, Baskes, and off Spayne, And made þe wal day and ny?t, Tyl it were strong, aply?t. When Kynge Rycharde with grete pyne Had made the walles of Chalyne, All his hoost with him he taas, And wente forth a grete paas. The fyrst nyght in the name of Marye He laye in the towne of Famelye. On morwe he let hym arme wele, Boþe in yryn and in steel; Be þe maryn forþ he wente To Albary, a castel gente, Þat was a castel off Sarezynesse, Fful off stor and gret ryhchesse, Boþe of fat fflesch, and of lene, Whete and ooten, pesen and bene. Kyng R. it wan, and soiournyd þere Þre moneþis al plenere; And sente spyes euery wayes Ffor to aspye þe cuntrayes. Off castel Daroun Kyng R. herde Al togederre hou it fferde. Al was it fful off Sarezynes, Þat were Goddes wytherwynes. Kyng R. hyyd þedyr ffaste Þe Sarezynes ffor to make agaste. So longe he wente by hys iournay, He come þedyr be Seynt Iames day. He beseged castel Daroun To wynne þe castel and þe toun. Þe castel was maad off swylke ston, Þat þey doutyd sawt ry?t non. Aboute þe castel was a dyke, Þey hadde neuere jsen non slyke. Þe Sarezynys cryyd in here langage: “Crystene houndes off euyl rage! But ?e the sooner wende home, Here ?e haue ffet ?oure dome!” Whenne Kyng R. herde þat cry, He swor hys oþ be Seynte Mary Þe Sarezynes scholde be hangyd alle Or swylke a cas hem scholde befalle. Þe Crystene assaylyd, and þey deffendyd, And many a quarel out þey sendyd. Al þat day and al þat ny?t Þey and þe Crystene heeld ffy?t. Þe Crystene saw þey my?te nou?t spede, Kyng R. took anoþir rede. Kyng R. garte alle þe Englys To repe rysshys in þe marys To ffylle þe dykes off Daroun, To wynne þe castel and þe toun. Twoo grete gynnes for þe nones Kyng R. sente ffor to caste stones. By water þey were jbrou?t anon; Þe Mate-Gryffoun was þat on, Þat was set vpon an hel To breke doun tour and castel; Þat oþir hy?te Robynet, Þat on anoþir hyl was set. Kyng R. bent a mangenel Þat keste to anoþer tourel. Kyng R. dede þe ryssches ffaste Bynden, and into þe dyke caste, And al playn þe dykes made. Þe Sarezynes þeroff hadde no drade; Wylde ffyr þeron þey caste, Þe ryssches were on ffyre in haste, And brenden ry?te to þe grounde, Soone wiþjnne a lytyl stounde. Off oure Crystene many an hundred Wer þeroff gretly awundryd. Þe mangeneles þrew alway, And brak þe walles ny?t and day. Þe Robynet and þe Mate-Gryffoun, Al þat þey hytte wente adoun, So þat wiþjnne a lytyl stounde Þe outemeste wal was layd to grounde, And ffyllyd fful þe grete dyke, And oure men entryd hastelyke. Þo oure Crystene-men my?ten wel Entren into Dareyn-castel. Þe Eerl off Leyceterre, Sere Roberd, Þe treweste body of myddylerd, He was þe ffyrste, wiþouten ffayle, Þat Castel Daroun gan assayle; Vp he lyffte hys banere, And smot in on hys destrere. Þe Sarezynes wiþ mysauentoure Fledde into þe heyeste toure, That was bothe stronge and starke, All of Sarasynes warke; And manye off hem stoden wiþoute, And ffou?ten faste in grete doute; Agayn þe eerl Sere Robard Þey geuen many a dynt fful hard. Many an helme þere was ofweuyd, And many a bacynet was cleuyd, Scheeldes ffele cloue in twoo, And many stede stekyd alsoo. Robert Tourneham wiþ hys fawchoun, Þere he crakyd many a croun. Þe Longespay, þe Eerl off Rychemound, Wolde spare non heþene hound. All that theyr swerdes araught, It fell at the fyrst draught. There dyed many Crysten-men, But of the hethen suche ten. Among hem come Kyng Richarde, To ffy?te weel noþyng he sparde. Many on in a lytyl stounde Wiþ his ax he brou?t to grounde. Al on ffoote he gan ffy?te. Whenne þe Sarezynes hadden sy?te Hou plenteuous was hys payment, Non þere durste abyde hys dent. Þey wenten quyk, wiþouten ffable, And slowe here stedes in here stable, Þe fayreste destreres and stedes Þat my?te bere ony kny?t at nedes. Whete and fflour, fflesch and lardere, Al togedere þey sette on fere; Þey hadde leuere to don soo Þenne wiþ here vytaylles helpe here ffoo. By þe brethe Richard aspyde, And slow? dounry?t on ylke a syde, All þat he my?te ouyrtake, Non amendes my?te he make. He gan asayle þe heye tour Wiþ wy?te men off gret valour. Þe Sarezynes in þe tour on hy? Sey? here endynge day was ny?. Wylde ffyr sone in haste Among þe Crystene-men þey caste. Þat ffyr ffley? aboute so smerte, Þat manye Crystene-men it herte. Þey my?te nou?t longe suffre þat þrawe, Anon þey gunnen hem wiþdrawe A myle ffro Daroune-castel, Þey caste abrode many a ffyr-barel, And soone after in a lytyl spase, Þorw? þe help off Goddes grace, Þe castel become on ffyr al Ffro þe tour to þe outemeste wal. Here houses brende, and here hurdys, Gret smoke þer aros, jwis. Þe Sarezynes in þe hey?e tour Were in swyche grete doloure. In þe hete þey were almost ateynt, And in þe smoke ny? adreynt. Ten þer cryyd at on word: “Mercy Kyng R., leue lord! Let vs goo out off þis tour, And þou schalt haue gret tresour; Wiþ lyff and leme þou lete vs goo, A þousand pound we geue þe too.” “Nay”, quod R., “be Jhesu Cryst, By hys deþ and hys vpryst, ?e schole neuere come adoun, Tyl payed be ?oure raunsoun: And ?it, herafftyr, be at my wylle, Wheþer j wole ?ow saue or spylle; Or elles ?e schole ry?t there sterue.” “Lord,” þey sayde, “we schole þe serue, Alle þy wylle wiþ vs þou doo, Wiþ þat we may come þe too; To honge, or drawe, brenne, or sle, Our fredome, lorde, is in the!” Kyng R. grauntyd þan, And comaundyd euery Crystene-man Lete þe Sarezynys to borwe Tyl þe sunne ros on morwe. It was so don as j fynde. Kynge Richarde let hem faste bynde, Vpon a playn before þe walle Kyng R. bad lat bryng hem alle; And he þat payde a þousand pound Ffor hys hed, my?te passe sound; And þat wolde so mekyl geue To a certayn daye, he leet hem leue; And he þat payde no raunsoun, Als tyt his hed was stryken doun: And þus Kyng R. wan Daroun, God geue vs alle hys benysoun, And his soule reste and ro, And ours whan it cometh therto! Afftyr þe wynnyng off Daroun Kyng R. wente to anoþer toun, To Gatrys, wiþ ffayr meyne, To besege þat cyte. Nou herkenes hou he it wan, And ye may here off a dou?ty man, A stout werreour and a queynte That neuere was ffounden in herte ffeynte. He þat was lord off Gatris Hadde ben a man off mekyl prys, And ffel to ffy?t a?eyns hys ffoo; But þat ylke tyme he was nou?t soo, Ffor he was ffallen into elde, Þat he my?te non armes welde. But as he dede a ffayr queyntyse, Herkenes now in what wyse! In myddes þe toun vpon a stage He leet make a marbyl ymage, And crownyd hym stoutly as a kyng, And bad his ffolk, olde and ?yng, Þat þey scholde neuere be aknowe To Crystene-man, hy? ne lowe, Þat þey hadde no lord off dygnyte, But þat ymage in þat cyte. Kyng Richard, þe werreour kene, There assaute he begane bydene. Spryngalles and mangeneles he bente, And stones to þe cyte he sente. Þe Sarezynes “Mercy!” cryede, Þey wolde kaste vp þe ?ates wyde, ?iff it were Richardes wylle Þat he wolde nou?t here peple spylle. Kyng R. grauntyd, wiþouten les; And þey hadde entre, al in pes. Kyng R. askyd at the fyrst word Off þat cyte where was þe lord, And þey answerde to þe kyng Þat þey hadde non oþir lordyng, But the ymage off marbyl ffyn, And Mahoun, here God, and Appolyn. Kynge Rycharde stode, so sayth the boke, And on the ymage he gan for to loke How hewge he was wrought, and how sterne, And sayd to them also yerne: “O Sarezynes, wiþouten fayle, Off ?oure lord j haue meruayle! ?yff j may, þorw? help of my Lord so goode, Þat bou?t vs alle with his blode, Wiþ a schafft smyte his nekke asunder, And ?e may see þat grete wundyr, Wole ?e leue alle vpon my Lord?” “?e!” þay sayden all at on word. Kyng Rychard leet dy?te hym a schafft Off trusty tree and kynde crafft: And, for it scholde be stronge and laste, He leet bynde þertoo fful ffaste Endlonge ffoure ?erdes off steel and yre; And syth R., þe grete syre, Leet sette þeron a corounnal kene. Whenne it was redy on to sene, Ffauuel of Cypre was forþ ffette, And in þe sadyl he hym sette. He rode his cours to þe stage, And in þe face he smot þe ymage. Þe hed flowe fro þe body insundyr, And slow? fyue Sarezynes þervndyr. Alle þe oþere seyde þan He was an aungyl and no man; And alle becomen Crystene þore, ?yng and olde, lesse and more. And hastely wiþoute lesyng, Here olde lord þey gan forþ bryng, And tolde hys compassement. Kyng R. low? wiþ good entent, And gaff hym þe cyte to welde, Þou? he leuyd Adammis elde. To Chaloyn Kyng R. wente agayn, Forth be þe maryn, soþ to sayn. Þere he soiournyd ffourteny?t, Wiþ many a noble and dou?ty kny?t. They pyght pauylyons fayre and wel To besege a strong castel Þat was a lytyl besyde hym, Þre myle ffro Castel-Pylgrym, Wiþ þykke walles and toures off pryde, Þat was callyd Leffruyde. Þe Sarezynes sey? þe kyng was come, For drede þey wende to be benome. Þaire herttis weren alle ille bystedde, And alle by nyghte awaye they fledde: Þe ?ates þey vnschette ful ?erne, And ffledden awey by a posterne. Ffor al þis wyde myddylerde Durste þey nou?t abyde Kyng Richerde. Þe noble castel, verrayment, Kyng R. wan wiþouten dent. Ffro þennes he wente to Gybelyn, Þat þe Hospytalers hadde wonyd in, And Templeres, boþe in fere, And kepten þe cyte many a ?ere. Whenne Bawdewyn was slayn wiþ bronde, Saladyn took þat toun on honde. In þat cyte was Seynt Anne jbore, Þat oure Lady was off core. Þey py?te the kynges pauyloun, And wiþ gret ffors þey toke þe toun; And slow? þe Sarezynes alle in same Þat wolde nou?t leue in Cristys name. Þer come the fyrst wykke tydyng To Quer de Lyoun R., oure kyng; Off Yngelond hys broþir Jhon, Þat was the fendes fflesch and bon, Þorw? help off þe barouns some Þe chaunceler þey hadde jnome, And wolde wiþ maystry off hand Be corownyd kyng in Yngeland At Estyr-tide afftyrward. Þenne answerde Kyng Richard: “What deuyl,” he sayde, “hou gos þis? Telles Ihon of me no more pris? He wenes þat j wil nou?t leue longe, Þerffore he wolde doo me wronge, And ?iff he wende j were on lyue, He wolde nou?t wiþ me stryue. J wole me so off hym bewreke, Þat al þe world þeroff schal speke. And Jhon hym corowne at Estyr-tyde, Where wole he þenne me abyde? Þer is no kyng in Crystyante, Sertes, þat schal his waraunt bee. J ne may leue it ffor no nede Þat Jhon my broþer wil do þis dede.” “?is, certes,” quod þe messangere, “He wyl soo do, by Seynt Rychere.” Kyng R. al þis tydyng In herte heeld but as lesyng. Ffro Gybelyn forþ þenne he wente To Bethanye, a castel gente, And slow? þere many an heþene man, And that noble cyte wan. Þer come oþere messangers Þat tolde Kyng R., stout and ffers, Þat Jhon hys broþir wolde bere Corowne at Estren, he gan to swere. Richard was loþ wiþdrawe his hand Tyl he hadde wunne þe Holy Land, And slayn þe Sawdon wiþ dynt off sword, And avengyd Jhesu oure Lord: But he beþou?te hym afftyr þen Þat he wolde leue þere alle his men, And wiþ hys preuy meyne Into Yngelond wolde hee, And asesse þe werre anon Betwene hym and hys broþer Jhon, And come agayn in hyyng To fulffylle hys begynnyng. And as he þou?te in hys herte, A stout Sarezyn gan in sterte Þat ou?te Kyng R. raunsoun Ffor þe wynnyng off Daroun. He spak to Rycharde apertelyche Among þe peple pore and ryche: “Sere, þou schalt aquyte me here, And alle oure oþer hostagere: Þorw? my queyntyse and my gynne I schal doo þe gret tresore wynne; More þen an hundryd þousand pounde Off ffloryns boþe rede and sounde Off Saladynes cheeff-tresore, And mekyl ryhchesse of here store. Þertoo j laye in hostage my lyff, And my chyldren, and my wyff: But ?iff j doo þe to wynne þat preye, On euele deþ do me to deye!” Kyng Rycharde sayd: “Þou myscreaunt, So as thou byleuest on Termagaunt, Tel me now what folk it is, I wene it is but al ffeyntys.” “Þoo þat lede þe tresore, saunt fayle, Sere, þey are þre þousand chamayle, And ffyue hundryd þer are alsoo Off asses, and mules, and ?it moo Þat leden gold to Saladyn, Tryyd syluyr, and tresore ffyn, Fflour off whete, and spysory, Cloþis of sylk, and gold þerby.” Sayde Kynge R.: “So God þe deme, Is þer mekyl peple þe tresore to ?eme?” “?e, Sere,” he sayd, “þer are before Kny?tes rydande syxty score, And afftyrwarde þousandes ten Off swyþe stronge heþene men. I herde hem speke in rownyng Þey were afferyd off þe, Sere kyng.” Quod Kyng R.: “Þey schal it ffynde, Þow? þer were syxty þousynde, And j wer but myself alone, J wolde hem mete euerylkone. Doo now sey me anon ry?t Where may j ffynde hem þis ny?t?” Þe Sarezyn sayde: “I þe telle Where þey wyll abyde and dwelle: Here be souþe, mylys ten, Þou may ffynde þe heþene men. Þere þey wole resten and abyde Tyl more folk come þer ryde.” Þe kyng hym grayþid, and wente anon, Hys barouns afftyr euerylkon. Al þat ny?t wiþ ffayr couey Þey rede fforþ by þe wey. Þenne sayde þe spye to þe kyng: “Sere, make here þy restyng! Þey are loggyd in þis toun, I wyl goo, and aspye þer roun. Anon j wole to hem goo, And brewe hem a drynk of woo, And saye to hem þat Kyng Richard Js at Jaffe, to Yngeland ward. Þey wole me leue wiþ þe beste, Þenne wole þey gon to reste; Þenne may þou to hem wende, And slou hem alle faste slepende.” “Ffy! A debles!” quod þe kyng, “God geue þe now an euyl endyng!

Be þey dukes, prynces, or kynges, Here schole þey make here endynges.” Þe Sarezyn þe kyng answerde: “Þy pere is nou?t in myddyl-erde, Ne non so mekyl off renoun: Weel may þou hote Coer de Lyoun! Þerffore j wole it nou?t forhele Þer are off Sarezynes twoo so fele As þou hast folk in þis cuntree, Certaynly, j telle þee.” Quod Kyng R.: “God geue þe care! Þerfore is nou?t myn herte sare. Ffor on off my Crystene-men Is wurþ Sarezynes nyne and ten. Þe moo þer be, þe more j schal sloo, And wreke Jhesu off hys ffoo.” Fforþ wente þe spye wiþ þen To aspye þe heþene men. Al he spyyd here compassyng, And tolde it R. oure kyng. He gan crye: “Az armes! ?are! Coer de Lyoun, loo now þey ffare!” Anon leep Kyng Richard Vpon hys goode stede Lyard; And hys Ynglyssh and his Templers Ly?tly lopen on here destrers, And flynges into þe heþene hoost, In þe name off þe Holy Goost. As þe Sarezynes wiþ here nobelay To þe Sawdon were in here way, Kyng R. smot hem among; Þere aros no blysseful song, But to Termagaunt and Mahoun Þey cryede faste, and to Plotoun. Kyng R. a kyng gan bere Þorw? þe herte wiþ a spere, Afftyrward hys ax he drow?, Many an heþyn hound he slow?; Some he cleuyd into þe sadyl, It bewepte þe chyld in þe cradyl. A kyng he cleff vnto þe arsoun, Þat hym halp nou?t hys God Mahoun. Many an heþene Sarezyne He sente þere to helle pyne. Þe Templers and þe Hospytalers Wunne þere manye fayre destrers. So longe þey fou?te, so says þe story, Þat Kyng R. hadde þe vyctory Þorw? help off hys gode kny?tys, Stoute in armes and stronge in fy?tes; And manye scapyd wiþ dedly wounde, Þat ne leuyd nou?t no stounde. Þey wolde afftyr no more mete Kyng R. be wey ne strete. Now may ?e here of þe wynnyng Þat þer wan R. oure kyng. Hors off prys and gret camayle, Fyue hundryd and ten, saun fayle; Syxe hundryd hors, off grete coursours, Chargyd al wiþ riche tresours, Þat were in coffres bounde ferlye, Wiþ ffyn syluyr and gold ful trye. Þer were þre hundryd mules and moo Þat pennyys and spyses boren þoo; Þer afftyr ffyfftene hundryd asse Bar wyn and oyle, more and lasse; And als manye wiþ whete-rede: It was to R. a gracyous dede! When he al þis tresore wan, Home he wente to hys men þan, Into Beþany that cyte noble Wiþ þat tresore and þe moble. He gaff þe hyghe and þe lowe Off his purchas good jnowe. He gaff hem destrers and coursours, And delte among hem his tresours. So Richard partyd hys purchas, Off al Crystyndom belouyd he was. Þerafftyr in a lytyl stounde Come messangerys off mekyl mounde: Þe bysschop off Chestyr was þat on, Þat oþir þe abbot off Seynt Albon Þat brou?te hym lettres speciele, Aselyd wiþ þe barouns sele, Þat tolde hym his broþir Ihon Wolde do corowne hym anon, At þe Pask, be comen dome, But he þe raþir wolde come home; Ffor þe kyng off Fraunce wiþ enuye Haþ aryuyd in Normandye. Quod Kyng R.: “Be Goddes payne, Þe deuyl has to mekyl mayne! Al here bost and here deray, Þey schal abeye it sum day!” Þere he dwellyd tyl Halewemes, And þenne he gan to Jaffes passe. Ffor seuene ?er and for more Þe castel he gan astore. Ffyfftene þousand, j fynde in boke, He leffte þat castell ffor to loke Ffor to kepe weel þat land Out off Saladynys hand Tyl he agayn come my?te Frome Yngelonde, as he has ty?te; And þenne he wente to Acres ward, Þe dou?ty body Kyng Richard. Now off Saladyn speke we What dool he made and pyte, Whenne he wyste off þat caas, Þat hys tresore robbyd was. And ffor hys men þat were slawe, He waryyd his God, and cursyd his lawe, And swor he wolde awroken be, My?te he euere hys tyme jsee. Soo þat tyme a spye come jn, And sayde þus to Saladyn: “Lord,” he sayde, “be blyþe off mode, Ffor j þe brynge tydynges goode, To þyn herte a blyþe present: Kyng R. is to Acres went, Ffor ouyr he wole to Yngelonde! For hym is come swylke a sonde That Jhon hys broþer, j þe swere, Wole elles hys corowne bere. Jaffes he hath astoryd ary?t, Wiþ many a baroun and gentyl kny?t. Ffyfftene þousand, j wot fful weel, Schal kepen wel þat castel, ?iff he may so weel spede Tyl he come ffrom his thede. But see, lord, wiþouten ffayle, Ffro his body kyttes þe tayle.” Offte was Saladyn wel and woo, But neuere soo glad as he was þoo. Þe spye he gaff an hundrid besauntes Þat brou?te hym þat presauntes, And alsoo a fayr destrere, And a robe jffurryd wiþ blaundenere. Þenne wolde he no lengere abyde, He sente aboute on ylke a syde, Vpon leme and vpon lyff, Vpon chyldryn and vpon wyff, Þat þey come to hym belyue To helpe hym out off londe dryue Kyng R. wiþ hys grete tayle. To hym come many an admyrayle, Many a duke, and many a kyng, And many ful gret lordyng Off Egypte, and off Arabye, Off Capados, and off Barbarye, Off Europ, and off Asclauoyne, Off Ynde, and off Babyloyne, Off Grete Grece, and Tyre also, Off empyres, and kyngdomes manye moo, Off alle heþene land, j ffynde, Ffro þe Grekyssche see to Grete Ynde. Charles kyng ne Alysaundre, Off whom has ben so gret slaundir, He hadde neuere swylke an hoost. In þe cuntre þer he lay, a coost, Ffyue myle it was off brede, And more, j wene, so God me rede; Twenty myle it was off lengþe: It was an hoost off gret strengþe. To Jaffe cyte þey comen skete, Þe Crystene-men þe ?ates dede schete. Þer was wiþjnne a lytyl þrawe On boþe halff many man slawe. So strong and hard was þat batayle, Þat it fferde, wiþouten fayle, As it hadde be ffro heuene ly?t, Among þe swerdes þat were so bry?t. And euere þe Crystene ful weel ffau?t, And slowene Sarezynes, but it seruyd nau?t; Ffor it fferde, thar no man axe, As þey out off the ground were waxe, Þat no slau?tyr off swerdes kene My?t þere noþyng be sene. Þe Crystene fledde into þe castel, And kepten þe ?atys swyþe wel. Þe Sarezynes þe cyte nome To theyr will and to theyr dome. Þenne began þe Sarezynes Vnder þe wal to make mynes. Þe Crystene-men ffor þe nones Al toffrusschyd hem wiþ stones. Þe Sarezynys ?ede aboute þe wal, And þrewe, and schotten in, ouyr al; Many a brennande scharp quarel Þey schotten jnto Jaffe castel. Þey sou?ten where þey my?te beste Oure Crystene-men agreue meste. At þe laste a ?ate þey ffounde Nou?t ffast schet, at þat stounde. Þere þey ffond strong metyng Wiþ swerdes and speres fful greuyng. To wedde þey leffte a þousynd men, And off þe Crystene were slayn ten. Þe Sarezynes, þou? þey were stoute, At þe ?ate men putte hem oute. Þe Sarezynes ffor no nede Þat day ne my?te þey nou?t spede. At ny?t, be þe mone cler, Þe Crystene sente a messanger To Kyng R. to Acres cyte, And prayde þe kyng for Goddes pyte Þat he scholde to hem come, Or ellys þey were alle jnome. Þey tolde hym þe harde caas Off þe Sawdonys hoost hou it was; And but he come to hem anon, Þey were forlorn euerylkon. Kyng R. answeryd anon ry?t: “Weel j knowe þe Sawdonys ffy?t; He wole make a lytyl deray, And also tyt he wole away. J nele for hym to hem wende; But sone socour j schal hem sende.” He callyd to hym hys nevew, A baroun off ry?t gret vertew Þat hy?te Henry off Champayn, And bad hym wende to Jaffe playn. “Tak”, he sayde, “wiþ þe þyn hoost, And abate þe Sawdonys boost.” “Az armys!” anon he gan crye Among hys hoost; þey scholde hy?e Wiþ Sere Henry ffor to wende Jaffe to helpe, and to deffende Agayn þe Sawdon Saladyn And many a cursyd Sarazyn. On morwe wente þere wiþ Sere Henry Many a baron and kny?t hardy. Gascoyn, Spanyard, and Lumbard Ffor þe byddyng off Kyng Richard. Þey wenten fforþ be þe maryn Tyl þey comen to Palestyn. Off Saladynys hoost þey seyen þen Al þe cuntre coueryd wiþ heþene men; And whene þe Sawdon off hem herde, Swythe towarde them he ferde; And whenne þe Duke Henry it wiste, He fledde a?en, be Jhesu Chryste, Þat he ne made no taryyng Tyl he come to R. oure kyng, And seyde he ne sey? neuere ne herde In al þis wyde myddyl-erde Haluyndel þe peple off men Þat Saladyn has, be dounne and den. “No tungge”, he seyde, “may hem telle; I wene þey comen out off helle.” Þenne answerde Kyng Richard: “Ffy, a debles, vyle coward! Schal j neuere, be God aboue, Trustene vnto Frenssche-mannes loue! My men þat in Jaffe beth, They may wyte the of theyr deth! Ffor þy deffawte, j am adred, My goode barouns beþ harde bested. Now, for þe loue off Seynte Marye, Schewe me quykly my galye! Now to schyp, on and oþir, Ffadyr and sone, eme and broþir! Alle þat euere loue me, Now to schyppe, pour charyte!” Alle þat wepne ber my?te, To schyppe þey wente anon ry?te, And wenten agayn to Jaffe ward Wiþ þe doughty Kyng Richard. Now herkenes of my tale soþ, Þow? j swere ?ow none oþ! J wole rede romaunce non Off Pertenope, ne of Ypomadon, Off Alisaunder, ne of Charlemayn, Off Arthour, ne off Sere Gawayn, Nor off Sere Launcelet-de-Lake, Off Beffs, ne Gy, ne Sere Vrrake, Ne off Ury, ne of Octauyan, Ne off Hector, the stronge man, Off Jason, ne off Hercules, Ne off Eneas, ne off Achylles. I wene neuere, par ma fay, Þat in þe tyme off here day, Dede ony off hem so dou?ty dede Off strong batayle and gret wy?thede, As dede Kyng Rychard, saun fayle, At Jaffe in þat batayle Wiþ hys ax and hys sword; His soule assoile Jhesu oure lord! It was before þe hey?e myd-ny?t, Þe mone and þe sterres schon ful bry?t, Kyng R. vnto Jaffe was come, Wiþ hys galeyes alle and some. Þey lokyd towarde þe castel, Þey herde no pype ne flagel. Þey drow? hem ny? to þe lande ?iff þey my?te vndyrstande; And þey ne cowde nou?t aspye, Be no voys off menstralsye, Þat quyk man in þe castel ware. Kyng R. þenne become ful off care: “Allas”, he sayde, “þat j was born, My goode barouns ben forlorn! Slayn is Roberd off Leycestre, Þat was myn owne curteys meystre; Ylke here off hym was wurþ a kny?t! And Robert Tourneham, þat was so wy?t, And Sere Bertram, and Sere Pypard, In batayle þat were wys and hard; And alsoo myn oþere barouns, Þe beste of all my regyouns, Þey ben slayne and all totore, Hou may I lengere leue þerfore; Hadde j be tyme comen hedyr, J my?te haue sauyd al togedyr! Tyl j be wreken off Saladyne, Certys, my ioye schal j tyne!” Þus waylyd Kyng R. ay Tyl it were spryng al off þe day: A wayte þer com in a kernel, And pypyd a moot in a flagel. He ne pypyd but on syþe, He made many an herte blyþe. He lokyd doun, and sey? þe galeys, Kyng R. and his naueys. Schyppys and galeyes wel he knew; Þenne a meryere note he blew, And pypyd: “Seynyours! or suis! or sus! Kyng R. is jcomen to vs!” But whenne þe Crystene herde þis, In herte þey were glad jwis. Erl, baroun, squyer, and kny?t, To þe walles þey sterten anon ry?t, And sey? Kyng R. here lord; Þey welcomed hym wiþ mylde word: “Welcome, lord, in Goddes name! Oure care is turnyd al to game.” Kyng R. hadde neuere jwis Haluyndel so mekyl blys. “A? armes!” he cryede, “makes ?ow ?are!” To hem þat wiþ hym comen ware. “We ne haue lyff but on: Selle we it dere, boþe fflesch and bon; Ffor to cleyme oure herytage Slee we þe houndes off euyll rage! Who so doutes ffor here manace, Haue he neuere sy?t off Goddys face! Take me myn axe in myn hande Þat was wroghte in Ynglande: Jt sall þis daye do god seruyce, Þat many a Sarazyne sall agryse! Here armure no more j ne doute Þenne it were a pylche-cloute. Þorw? grace off God in trynyte, Þis day men schal þe soþe jsee!” Al þe fferst on lande he leep, Of a dozeyn he made an heep. He gan to crye wiþ voys cler: “Where are þese heþene pawtener Þat haue the cyte off Jaffe nome? With my pollaxe j am come To waraunte þat j haue jdoo! Wesseyl j schal drynke ?ow too!” He leyde on ylke a syde ry?t, And slow? þe Sarezynes aply?t; Þe Sarezynes ffledde, and were al mate, Wiþ sorwe þey runne out at þe gate. In here herte þey were so ?arwe, Alle here ?ates hem þou?te to narwe. To þe walles þey ffledde off þe toun, On euery syde þey ffelle adoun. Sume off hem broken here swere, Legges and armes, al in ffere, And ylkon cryede in þis manere As ?e schal afftyrward here: “Malcan staran nair abru Lor ffermoir toir me moru.” Þis is to seye in Englys: “Þe Englysshe deuyl jcomen is, ?iff he vs mete, we schal deye; Fflee we ffaste out off hys weye!” Out off þe toun þey ffledde ylkone, Þat þer leffte neuer one But ffoure hundryd or ffyue Þat Richard brou?te out off lyue. At þe ?ate he sette porters, And stablede vp hys destrers. He leep vpon his stede Ffauel, Weel armyd in yryn and in steel. Þe ffolk hem armyd alle in ffere Þat out off þe galeys comen were, And manye comen out off þe castel Þat were armyd wundyr wel. Kyng R. rod out at þe ?ate, Twoo hethyn kynges he mette þerate, Wiþ syxty þousand Sarezynes fers, Wiþ armes bry?te and brode baners. Þat on vpon þe helme he hytte, Þat to þe sadyl he hym slytte; Þat oþir he hytte vpon the hood, Þat þe gyrdel-stede it stood; And hys Templers, and hys barouns, Ffaughte, egre as lyouns, And slowen Sarezynes also swyþe As gres falliþ fro þe syþe. Þe Sarezynes sey?en no betere won, But flowen awaye euerylkon Vnto Saladynes grete hoost Þat fyfftene myle lay a coost. Twoo and þrytty þousand, forsoþe to say, The Sowdan loste that same daye, For theyr armure fared as waxe Ayenst Kynge Rychardes axe. Many a Sarasyne and hygh lordynge Yelded them to Rycharde our kynge. He toke them in hostage tho, There were a thousande prysoners and mo. The chase lasted swythe longe Tyll the tyme of euensonge. Rycharde rode after tyll it was nyght, So many of them to deth he dyght, That no man it may acounte How many of them it wolde amounte. King Rycharde lefte without the towne, And pyghte there his pauylyowne; And that nyght with mylde herte He comforted his barons smarte. And ye shal here on the morwe Þat was a day of muche sorowe: The gretest batayll, j vnderstonde, That euer was in ony londe. And ye that this batayll wyll lere, Herken now, and ye shal here! As Kynge Richarde sate at his soupere, And gladded his barons with mylde chere, And comforted them with good wyne, Two messengers came frome Saladyne, And stode Kynge Rycharde before, With longe berdes and with hore. Off two mules they were alyght, In sylke and golde they were jdyght. Eyther helde other by the honde, And sayd: “Kynge Richarde, now vnderstonde, Oure lorde Saladyn, the hygh kynge, Sendis the now this askynge: If that thou were so hardy a knyght That thou durste abyde here alle nyghte Tyll to morowe that it daye ware, Of blysse thou sholde ben all bare. For thy lyfe and thy barons He wyll not gyue two skalons. He wyll the take with strength of hondes, For he hath folke of many londes, Egyens, and of Turkye, Of Moryens, and of Arabye, Basyles, and Embosyens, Ffull eger knyghtes of defens, Egypcyens, and of Surrye, Of Ynde Maior, and of Capadocye, Of Medes, and of Asclamoyne, Of Samarye, and of Babyloyne; Two hondred knyghtes without fayle, Fyue hondred of amarayle; The grounde ne may vnneth them bere, The folke that cometh the to dere. By our rede do ryght wel, And tourne agayne to Jaffe castell. Jn safe warde thou myght there be Tyll thou haue sente after thy meyne: And yf thou se thou may not stonde, Tourne agayne to thyn owne londe, And thus thou may fro the dede flee, Home to thi contree by the see.” In anger Rycharde toke a lofe, Þe croste in his hondes all torofe, And sayde to that Sarasyne: “God gyue the well euyll fyne! ?ow and Saladyn your lorde, The deuyll hange ?ow with a corde! For your counseyll and your tydynge, God gyue you well euyll endynge! Now go and saye to Saladyn In despyte of Appolyn I wyl abyde her the tyme; Thoughe he come to morowe or pryme, And though j were but myselfe alone, I wolde abyde them euerychone. And yf the dogge wyll come to me, My pollaxe shall his bane be; And saye that j hym defye, And all his cursed company! Go now, and saye to hym thus, The curse haue he of swete Jhesus!” The messengers wente to Saladyn, And tolde the begynnynge and þe fyne. Saladyn meruayled than, And sayde it was none erthly man: “He is a deuyll or a saynt, His myght founde j neuer faynt.” Anone he made his ordeynynge, Therof ne roghte Richarde oure kynge. A nyght he wente to Jafes ward For to take Kynge Rycharde. Therof Rycharde toke no kepe, But all nyght laye and slepe Tyll it was ageynst the dawnynge; Than herde he a shyll cryenge. Thorugh Goddes grace, an aungell of heuen Tho seyd to hym, with mylde steuen: “Aryse, and lepe on Fauell, And tourne agayne to Jaffe castell! Thou haste slepte longe jnough! Thou shalte it fynde harde and tough! Or thou come to that cyte Thou shalte be wraþed, and thy meyne. After þe batayll, do by myn hees, With the Sowdan thou make thy peas. Take trues, and let thy baronage Vnto the flome do theyr pilgrimage, To Nazareth, and to Bedlem, To Caluarye, and to Jherusalem; And let them wende hom after then, And come thou after with thy ship-men: For enemyes thou haste, j vnderstonde, Here and in thyne owne londe. Vp! sayd the aungell, and well þou spede! Thou ne haddest neuer more nede!” Rycharde arose as he wolde wede, And lepte on Fauell his goode stede, And sayd: “Lordynges! Or sus! Or sus! That hath vs warned swete Jhesus!” He blew and cried: “As armes wate!” But almost he com to late, For Saladyn and his tem Was bytwene Jaffe and them. Þeder he was by ny?t come King Ric. to haue ynome. That was to Rycharde moche payne, That he ne myght no?t his hoost ordayne, But prekyd forþ vpon Fauuel, And garte hys launse byte fol wel. Þerwiþ he slow?, wiþouten doute, Þree kynges off þe Sawdones route. Hys hors was strong, hymseluen good, Hors ne man hym non wiþstood. He hew vpon þe heþene cors, Þat vnto grounde fel here hors. Who that hadde seen hys cuntenaunse, Wolde euere haue had hym in remembraunce. Þey gunnen on hym as þykke to ffleen, As out off the hyue doþ þe been; And wiþ hys ax doun he sweepe Off þe Sarezynys as bere doþ scheepe. Ynglyssche and Frenssche gunne aftir ryde, To ffy?te þey were ful ffressche þat tyde; Upon the Sarasynes faste they donge With swerdes and with launces stronge, And layden on wiþ al here my?t, And slowen þe Sarezynes dounry?t. But þeroff was full lytyl keepe: So manye of hem þer were on hepe, Þat no slau?tyr, wiþouten fayle, My?te be sene in þat batayle. A myr þer was wiþouten Jaffes, A myle brod, wiþouten les. Mawgre þe Sarezynes R. þe syre Þree þousand drof into þe myre. Þoo my?te men se þe heþene men Lyggen and baþen hem in þe fen; And þoo þat wolden haue come vppe, Þey drank off Kyng Richardis cuppe. What þere were drownyd, and what were slawe, Þe Sawdon loste of þe heþene lawe Syxty þousand in lytyl stounde, As it is in Ffrensche jffounde. Kyng R. wente agayn To helpe hys hoost wiþ my?t and mayn; Now he was þere, now he was here, To gouerne hys hoost wiþ hys powere. Sey? neuere man, j haue herd telle, One man so manye Saryzynys quelle. And in þe moste peryle off þe batayle Kyng R. sey?, wiþouten ffayle, Hys eme, Sere Henry off Champayn, Ffeld off hys hors doun on þe playn. Þe Sarezynes hadde hym vndyr honde, To slen hym fful ffaste þey ffonde. It hadde been hys daye laste, Ne hadde Kyng R. comen in haste. Kyng R. cryede wiþ lowde voys: “Help God and þe holy croys! Þys ylke day myn eme þou schylde, Ffro deþ off þese doggys wylde. Lordynges,” he sayde, “lays vpon; Letes off þese houndes ascape non: And j myselff schal proue to smyte, ?iff my polax wyll ou?t byte.” Men my?ten see hym wiþ my?te and mayn Schede þe Sarezynys blood and brayn. Vpon þe place þat grene was, Many soule wente to Sathanas. Be þe dynunyng off þe more Men my?te see where R. ffore. Þe Templers comen hym to socour; Þere began a strong stour; Þey layden on as þey were wood, Tyl valeys runnen al on blood. Þe Longespay was a doughty kny?te, As he were wode he gan to ffy?te. Þe Eerl of Leycetre, Sere Robard, Þe Eerl of Rychemound, and Kyng R., Þere þese ylke kny?tes rod, Þere was slayn a way full brod, Þat ffoure waynes my?te on mete, So manye Sarezynes les þe swete. On boþe halff was many body Slayn, strong, bold, and hardy. And at þe last wiþ gret payne Kyng R. wan þe Eerl of Champayne, And sette hym vpon a stede Þat swyþe good was at nede, And bad hym wenden be hys syde, And nou?t a ffote ffro hym ryde. A messanger come swyþe reke With Kynge Rycharde for to speke, And sayde: “Sere, pour charyte, Turne agayn to Jaffe cytee! Helyd is boþe mount and playn: Kyng Alisaundyr ne Charlemayn, Hadde neuere swylk a route, As is þe cyte now aboute! Þe ?ates be on ffyre set Ry?t off Jaffe castellet: Þy men may neþer jn ne oute. Lord, off þe thay haue gret doute, Ffor ?e may nou?t to þe cyte ryde, Jn felde what auenture ?ow betyde! And j ?ow warne, wiþouten ffayle, Mekyl apayryd is ?oure batayle. Þe þatryark jtaken is, And Jhon-þe-Neel is slayn jwis, William of Arsour, and Sere Gerard, Bertram Braundys, þe goode Lumbard: All these are slayn, and many moo!” Kyng R. beþou?te hym þoo, And gan to crye: “Turne arere, Euery man wiþ his banere!” And many þousand before hym schete Wiþ swerdes and wiþ launses grete, Wiþ fauchouns and wiþ maces boþe; Kyng R. þey made ful wroþe. Þey slowen Ffauuel vndyr hym, Þenne was Kyng R. wroþ and grym. Hys ax fro hys arsoun he drow?, Þat ylke Sarezyn sone he slow? Þat stekyd vndyr hym his stede: Þerfore he loste hys lyff to mede. On foote he was, and on he leyde; Manye vnder hys hand þer deyde. Alle þat hys ax areche my?te, Hors and man he slow? doun ry?te, What before, and what behynde. A þousand and moo, as j ffynde, He slow? whyl he was on ffoote, Þat hem ne come neuere help ne boote. Saladynes twoo sones come ryde, Ten þousand Sarezynes by here syde, And gan to crye to Kyng Richard: “?elde þe þeff, traytour, coward! Or j schal sloo þe in þis place!” “Thou lyest,” quod R., “be Goddes grace!” And wiþ hys ax he smot hym soo, Þat hys myddyl fflow? in twoo. Þere halff þe body ffel adoun, And þat oþir halff leffte in þe arsoun. “Off þe,” quod R., “j am sekyr.” Hys broþir com to þat bekyr, Vpon a stede wiþ gret raundoun, He þou?te to bere Kyng R. doun, And gaff hym a wounde þorw? þe arme: Þat dede Kyng Rycharde mekyl harme. Vpon þe spere-hed was venym; And Kyng R. stoutly smot hym, Þat hors and man ffyl ded to grounde: “Lygge þere,” he sayde, “þou heþene hounde! Schalt þou neuere telle Saladyne Þat þou madyst me my lyff to tyne!” Wiþ þat fyue dukes off Heþenys Come wiþ here hoost wiþouten mis, And bysette aboute R. oure kyng, And þou?ten hym to deþe bryng: Kyng R. in a lytyl þrawe Þe ffyue dukes hadde jslawe; And ffele hundryd afftyr þen Off swythe stronge heþene men. And at þe laste, þou? it were late, Rycharde wanne vnto Jaffes ?ate: Þenne were oure Crystene-men ful sekyr Þat þey scholde ouercome þe bekyr. Þe Eerl of Leycestre, Sere Robard, Brou?te oure kyng hys stede Lyard. Kyng R. into þe sadyl leep, Þenne fledde þe Sarezynes as þey were scheep. Rycharde rode afftyr tyl it was ny?te, And slow? all þat he ouertake my?te. Þere were slayn in playn and den Ten hundryd þousand heþene men. Þat ny?t Rycharde wiþouten les Wan into the cyte of Jaffes, And þankyd Jhesu, kyng off glorye, And hys modyr off þat victorye: Ffor siþþe þe world was ferst begunne, A ffayrere batayle was neuere jwunne. At morwen he sente Robert Sabuyle, And Sere Wyllyam Wateuyle, Huberd and Robert Tourneham, Gawter, Gyffard, and Jhon-Seynt-Jhan, And bad hem seye to the Sawden Þat hymselff agayn ffyue and twenty men In wylde ffeeld wolde ffy?te To derayne Goddes ry?te; ?yff he it wynne to haue þe land Euere in Crystene-mennys hand; And ?iff þe Sarezynes my?te hym slee, Þe land scholde euere þe Sawdonys bee. And ?iff he wole nou?t here hys sawes, “Seys þree ?er, þree moneþis, and þre dawes, I aske trewes off þe Sawdan To wenden home, and come agayn þan.” Þe messangeres gunne to wende, And tolde þe Sawdon wurd and ende, He wolde nou?t consente to þat batayle; Ffyue hundryd agayn R. saun ffayle! At morwen ?iff he wolde come, Þe trewes scholde ben jnome. Þus he tolde þe messangers, And þey it tolde Richard þe ffers. Þe nexte day he made foreward Off trewes to þe Kyng Richard. Þree ?er thane wente þay to þe flome Ffro Acres þat wolde come. Þoo afftyrward alle þe þre ?ere Crystene-men boþe fer and nere ?eden þe way to Ierusalem, To þe Sepulchre, and to Bedlem, To Olyuete, and to Nazarel, And to Emaus castel, And to alle oþere pylgrymage, Wiþoute harme or damage.
