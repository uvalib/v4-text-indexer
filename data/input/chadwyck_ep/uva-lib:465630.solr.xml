      <field name="fulltext">Dulces ante Omnia Musæ. Virg. 'Tis hard to say, what mysteries of fate, What turns of fortune on good writers wait. Harte. MEMOIRS OF THE Author's LIFE, &amp;c. ODE. I Nor Heaps of Gold, nor Monuments as high As the Ambition of the Great, Can buy one Moment tow'rds Eternity, Or change the fix'd Decrees of Fate; 'Tis Verse alone can give a Name, And crown our Actions with eternal Fame: Thus mighty Cæsar's Triumphs live, Not in his Monuments, but those his Poets give. II In Fields of Death, the bleeding Warriors toil, And brave the loudest Storms of Fate; They die to make eternal Fame their Spoil, And pawn their Life for being Great: To Virtue, Verse this Fame can give, Virtue by Verse, by Virtue Poets live; For her they tune their Numbers high; For Virtue is the Burning-Glass of Poetry. III But, ah! where does this heavenly Goddess dwell? Where does her blessed Seat remain? We search the Palace, and the Hermit's Cell, We search, but search, alas, in vain! Gold is the Load-stone of the Great, And vulgar Souls must catch the glitt'ring Bait; The Scale of Justice sinks with Gold, And impious Bribes to win the Cause, must damn the Soul. IV In Tufton, Muse behold the Deity, With him begin to grace your Song; All that is great, and good in him, you see, To him your Voice, and Lyre, belong; He rais'd you from a low Degree, Then let your Numbers raise him to the Sky; Offer what Gifts the Muse can give, He gave you Fame, then make his Fame to live. V But, ah, my Muse, your Colours are too faint, Your Strength too weak, your Theme too great, Alas! in vain, your Pencil strives to paint, What Mortal cannot imitate: But if he Smile, then stretch your Wing, And tune his Praises on a bolder String; Then ev'ry Tongue shall speak his Fame, And Criticks spare my Verse, protected with his Name. VI Thus Gold, at first, is but a sluggish Mass, Whilst it lies cover'd in the Earth; But when 'tis coin'd, the awful Monarch's Face Makes it a God, and gives it Birth; The World the sudden God adore, And humbly own his universal Power; Sceptres and Kings are in his Hand, And Nature reverences his supreme Command. [Three Poetasters in One Age were born] Three Poetasters in One Age were born; And all at once did Appleby adorn; The first in Penury of Thought surpast, In Rumbling Cant the next, in Both the Last; The Force of Dulness could no farther go, To make a Third she join'd the former Two. [As the Brute-World to Father Adam came] As the Brute-World to Father Adam came, Requesting, with enquiring Looks, a Name, To ev'ry Beast, a Title he assign'd, And nominated all the Sylvan-kind. So savage Multitudes about Me throng, Did Adam's Talent but to Me belong! Yet, tho' they cheat the World, by their Disguise, They are but Asses, to Poetick Eyes. [Whoever gives himself the Pains to stoop] Whoever gives himself the Pains to stoop, And take my venerable Tatters up; To his presuming Inquisition I, In Loco Pattisoni thus reply. ‘Tir'd with the senseless Jargon of the Gown, ‘My Master left the College, for the Town; ‘Where, from Pedantick Drudgery secur'd, ‘He laughs at Follies which he once endur'd; ‘And scorns his precious Minutes to regale, ‘With wretched College-Wit, and College-Ale; ‘Far nobler Pleasures open to his View, ‘Pleasures for ever Sweet! for ever New! ‘Bright Wit, soft Beauty, and Ambition's Fire ‘Inflame his Bosom, and his Muse inspire; ‘While to his few, but much endearing Friends, ‘His Love, and humble Service, he commends. [There is a Time, when Love no Wish denies] There is a Time, when Love no Wish denies, And smiling Nature throws off each Disguise; But who can Words, to speak those Raptures find? Vast Sea of Extacy, that drowns the Mind! That fierce Transfusion of exchanging Hearts! That gliding Glimpse of Heav'n, in pulsive Starts! The Rush of Joy! that wild tumultuous Roll! That Fire! that kindles Body into Soul! And, on Life's Margin, strains Delight so high, That Sense breaks short, and while we taste, we die! YARICO to INKLE: AN EPISTLE. Dear, faithless Man! if e'er that cruel Breast Love's pleasing Toys, and soft Delights, confest; Distress like mine, may sure thy Pity move, For tender Pity is the Child of Love! But can Compassion from thy Bosom flow? Source of my Wrongs, and Fountain of my Woe! Wilt thou, repentant, soften at my Grief, Melt at my Tears, and lend a late Relief! What have I done? ah! how deserv'd thy Hate? Or was this Vengeance treasur'd up by Fate? Then will I mourn my Fate's severe Decree, Nor charge a Guilt so black, so base on Thee; For O! I know, ah no! I knew, thy Mind Soft as the Dove, and as the Turtle kind; How have I seen thy gentle Bosom move, And heave, contagious, to some Tale of Love! How have I heard thee paint the faithfull'st Pair, Describe their Bliss, and e'en their Raptures share! Then have thy Lips, with sweet Transition swore Thy Love more lasting, and thy Passion more! And what, is Truth, if Signs like these deceive? Signs! that might win the wariest to believe. VERSES on the Death of Mr. W. Pattison. Oft have I sung to thee, my Friend, when living, Oft have I sung,—and thou hast sung to me: Oft the delightful Musick of thy Numbers, Has sooth'd the Anguish of my anxious Mind. I weep to think of all our youthful Actions, I weep and wish, and weep and wish again, That all these Actions could but be renew'd, And we our once liv'd Life again live o'er, And run the Stream of easy Innocence— But now no more—I sigh to say no more, How can I say that Word without a Tear, The Tribute due from me to thy pale Ghost: And since it is thy Due I will not wrong thee, But pay thee all thy Due, and more than's Due, If I can more than's Due—Accept them all I pour the willing Stream upon thy Ashes. When I reflect upon our Actions past, The innocent Amusements of our Youth, When I reflect upon the great Esteem We always entertain'd for one another. I pish at Life—and wish and seek for Death, To give me to those Regions where thou art: Those Regions which before we but imagin'd, And form'd a faint imperfect Vision of. Oft have we when in Solitude retir'd A faint imaginary Heav'n describ'd, By Words proportion'd to our grosser Senses; And what we fancy'd most delightful here, Of such Materials we compos'd our Heaven. ‘Heav'n's made of Gold, a golden vaulted Roof ‘O'erhangs the Pavement of a Silver Floor, ‘And Diamonds dart their sparkling Waters round, ‘To light the Courts of Heav'n!—and thus we strove, By sensible Resemblances to see That unimagin'd State thou now enjoy'st. Now heav'nly Bard thou know'st,—ay—well thou know'st That Gold and Silver give but faint Ideas Of that ineffable transcendent State, Where all Ideas are abstract from Sense. Gold has no Lustre to the Souls of Man, Gold is but tempting to our worldly Eye: But in the blessed Mansions of Above, There is some other Thing, I cannot think of, Whose faint Resemblance we describe by Gold, Silver and Diamonds; yet are none of these, Nor nothing like them. But by this we know That it is great and truly valuable. When we describ'd th' Inhabitants of Heaven, We gave them human Shape, because most perfect We yet have thought of, and we give 'em Wings, As Emblems of their great Velocity. But now, dear Bard, methinks I see thee living, Not shap'd like Man, or wing'd as we imagine; There's no Description that can soar to thee, Tho' enliven'd with thy own poetick Genius: Tho' thy Descriptions have been rich as Thought, Yet far below thy self they fault'ring fall. Thou hast no Shape as we imagine Shape, Nor Substance palpable to Touch or Eye: And when we say thou art an heav'nly Being, By that we mean a Thing we know not what, And paint a Being we know nothing of. Whene'er we form an Image of a Being, We give it Substance, and we give it Shape, Or else we lose the Meaning of our selves In Speculation. In this new State thou art An insubstantial Essence, a beauteous Being Too great to be compar'd to aught Below. When we delineate the Joys above, By Flowers, by Fruits, by Streams, by Groves we show them, And fill those Groves with Innocence and Musick, And ev'ry Colour that obliges Sense Of mortal Man, abound in great Profusion. But these are nothing like the Joys above, These are not Joys incomprehensible; But the Felicity thou now enjoy'st, Are too, too big for human Comprehension, Which soars no higher than the Bounds of Sense. When we put off this mortal Body, then We are divested of corporeal Senses, And then the Joys above would be invalid, If they address'd themselves, as those on Earth To the five Organs of the Senses only. The Joys, the Beings, or the Seats above, Are only to be known by Metaphor, And are not Objects to our finite Senses. What shall I say to thee, cælestial Bard, Words are too feeble to express my Thoughts. Sweet was thy Fancy, and exact thy Ear, Thy Numbers easy, and thy Judgment fine, Thy Conversation pleasing, and thy Mind Enliv'n'd by the Wit of ev'ry Author, And by thy own. Thy Memory was strong, Rich with Variety of Observations; Thy Correspondence friendly and sincere, And every other good Accomplishment, That is to be desir'd in a Friend, Companion or Poet were in Thee. Accept this Verse, the Tribute that is due From me to thee, from one Friend to another: Accept it, as an Instance of th' Affection That has surviv'd thee, and can never die: The Source of Friendship is Celestial, And there will be a Time in future Days, When this our Friendship shall exist again, And be immortal as our Souls in Heaven. TO A FRIEND. Sid. Coll. Cantab. March 15th 1724–5. SIR, From sacred Shades, and Academic Groves, Where, lost in Thought, a musing Fancy roves; What kind endearing Numbers shall I send, To meet the Critic, in the fondling Friend? Here learned Solitudes salute our Eyes, And the gay Scenes in real Raptures rise; Thro' Classic Shades majestick Domes aspire, And dimly from the piercing Eye retire. Deep thro' the Groves, old Cam serenely flows, Free from the pratling Naiads babling Noise. His Nymphs in gentle Silence move along, And hear their Murmurs in some soft'ning Song; Till by the forcing Torrent borne away, They mourn because they can no longer stay: Poetic Hills the wide Horizon bound, And wall the learned Paradise around. But yet—Tho' all Things with my Soul agree— Pall'd are my Joys, and tasteless, without Thee; These visionary Pleasures but renew The real Happiness I found in You; Where venerable Cowley's sacred Shade The sweetest Scene of Solitude is made; When stretch'd at Ease, amusingly we lay, How tunefully the Minutes danc'd away! Oh! sooth me, Fancy, with some pleasing Dream, And gently waft me to Ituna's Stream— Hark! the soft, balmy, breathing Breezes blow— Hark! Hederinda's warbling Murmurs flow— Here oft I left the busy World behind, And found the better Part, in You refin'd. But would you know how I divide my Time, Betwixt my Studies, Business, and my Rhime? Wak'd, by the Promise of a Day, we rise, And with our Souls salute the dawning Skies; All summon'd, to Devotion's Fane repair, And piously begin the Day with Prayer; Thence, led by Reason's glimm'ring Light, descry The dark Recesses of Philosophy; Thro' Classic Groves the wily Wanton trace, And logically urge the puzling Chace. But when the Sounds of the presaging Bell Noon's pleasurable Invitation tell; Moods, Methods, Figures, swim before my Sight, And Syllogisms wing their airy Flight. Confus'd, the Fairy Vision flitts away— And no Ideas, but of Dinner, stay. Thus, fabled Hags, at Midnight's solemn Noon, With Magic Spells inchant the lab'ring Moon; But when the Cock proclaims the springing Light, Each horrid Phantom disappears in Night. Now, those, whom recreating Toils invite, Pour'd on the Plain, indulge their lov'd Delight; Now flies aloft in Air the whirling Ball, Anxious, the learned Rabble wait its Fall; Pursu'd by wafting Caps the Fury flies, Rises in Height, and lessens in the Skies. Thus, healthfully refresh'd, we leave the Plain, For Pleasure, oft repeated, is but Pain. Next we survey the vast capacious Ball, And take long Journies o'er the learned Wall; Or from her tender Birth Britannia trace, And all her Glories center'd in great Brunswick's Race. The dark Original of Time renew, And bring three thousand wond'ring Years to View. Now, to the Muses soft Retirements fly, Or soar with Milton, or with Waller sigh; Each fav'rite Bard o'erpays my curious View, For who can fail to please who charms like You. To find us thus, Apollo takes his Way, To sooth the sultry Labours of the Day; The tuneful Muses charm his listning Ears, And in soft Sounds he hears away his Cares. Thus, dearest Florio, thus, my faithful Friend, In learned Luxury my Time I spend; Till length'ning Shades the setting Sun display, And falling Dews lament the falling Day: Then, tost in Thought, where aged Cam divides Those verdant Groves that paint his Azure Tides, With musing Pleasure I reflect around, And stand inchanted in Poetic Ground. Straight to my glancing Thought those Bards appear, That fill'd the World with Fame, and charm'd us here: Here Spenser, Cowley, and that awful Name Of mighty Milton, flourish'd into Fame; From these amusing Groves, his copious Mind, The blooming Shades of Paradise design'd. In these Retirements, Dryden fann'd his Fire, And gentle Waller tun'd his tender Lyre; Hail! happy Bards, whilst thus I think, I hear Your tuneful Melody improve my Ear, With Rev'rence I approach each sacred Shade, Perhaps by Your creating Numbers made. Delusion helps my Fancy as I walk, Hears Waters murmur, and soft Ecchoes talk; Thro' the dim Shade its sacred Poet sees, Or hears his Music in the wasted Breeze. Here, Locke and Newton thro' the World were known, And made unravell'd Nature's Works their own; Too soon we lost those Fav'rites of the Sky, Yet, Florio may the double Loss supply. Haste, then, my Friend, nor let me mourn your Stay, Lo! the World suffers by your long Delay— Let prosp'rous Fortune on your Will attend, And in your happy Wishes bless your Friend, W. Pattison. THE Jealous SHEPHERD; A PASTORAL. It happen'd once upon a Summer's Day, When Lads and Lasses go to making Hay; The weary Mowers laid themselves adown, To take a Bottle, and a Nap at Noon; When Bootyslub (for so was call'd the Swain, That languish'd under Dorothy's Disdain) While others slept, by Love was kept awake, To mourn his Fate, and mend his Dolly's Rake. Dolt as I am (complains the Love-sick Lout) Not to consider what I am about? Here I employ my little Stock of Art, But who, alas! shall mend my broken Heart? None can that Work perform but Dorothy, And that will ne'er be done by Cruelty; For still she persecutes me with Disdain, Laughs at my Woes, and banters all my Pain. Ah, Dolly! Dolly! can you be so dull, To leave your Lover for a foppish Fool? A Butterfly the Cabbages destroys, On you a Butterfly his Breath employs— I say no more—My Meaning you may guess— Perhaps you had been pleas'd, had I said less. But yet, there was a Time, or else I dream'd, When Bootyslub in your good Graces seem'd; Then, if you knew I kiss'd a Lass at Town, How have I seen you pout, and fret, and frown? Nay, once you told me, that I need not roam, For Charity should still begin at Home. These jealous Hints, or I mistake them, prove The greatest and the surest Signs of Love; Yet, if you lov'd, methinks you cou'd not be So kind to Floripert, so cross to me. Remember, how, to Jealousy betray'd, You scolded at the Parson's pretty Maid; When with enquiring Looks you pass'd the House, And catch'd me keeping up the Damsels Cows; Your scornful Eyes with jealous Fury burn'd, On her they glanc'd, and then on me they turn'd; I took the Hint, and fear'd what might ensue, So stooping, seem'd to buckle up my Shoe, Then left the Lass, and sneak'd away to you. Alas! alas! that I your Love believ'd! I lov'd, and in my Turn am thus deceiv'd. Nor dare I of my cruel Fate complain, Or, if I do, alas! 'tis all in vain. For ever curst be that detested Day, When from the last May-Fair we took our Way, Remember how you forg'd a false Excuse Your easy-natur'd Lover to abuse. No fondling Father call'd you back again, A better Reason! 'twas your fondling Swain; And if I meet him e'er alone, I vow, I'll surely beat the Puppy black and blue. I mark'd the watchful Coxcomb all the Day, And kept him from his meditated Prey; Invited him to exercise the Ball, And bravely give, or bravely ward a Fall: So should we both our pleading Merits show, And you, tho' blind, the Difference might know: But all I urg'd, I urg'd, alas! in vain, Nor would he Glory give, nor could he gain. Ah, Dolly! Dolly! where were all your Vows, When Cheese-Cakes lur'd you to the Tavern-House; Your Vows were as your Cheese-cakes sweet, yet weak! And can you both alike together break? But if you do so—You, with equal Ease, Can make new Vows, and Cheese-cakes, when you please. And could you then your Bootyslub forget, And in another's Lap so kindly sit? Around his Neck your fondling Arms you flung, And learn'd the silly Catches which he sung. Whilst unconcern'd at Home you hear me sing, Or tunefully torment the rosin'd String; Your Favour every Way I try to gain, But dance, or fiddle; sing, or pipe; in vain. Oh! learn at last a Flatterer to hate, And think on Susan Silly's cruel Fate: Her Pride poor honest Hobbinol despis'd, And vainly Tommy Taudry's Folly priz'd. But now, too late she sees herself undone, Her Portion squander'd, and her Honour gone— What better canst thou hope from such a Flame, But Love refuses what my Rage would name. How chang'd is Dolly now, from what she was When first—Ah, had I never spy'd the Lass! The very Time I perfectly can tell, For Love remembers every Thing too well! Sure, I can ne'er forget the Sunday Morn, Tho' from her Mem'ry so soon 'tis worn: A goodly Bible in my Hand I took, And very gravely thought to read my Book; When thro' the Window, by a luckless Chance, Heedless, I cast a customary Glance; 'Twas there I saw the pretty Dolly walk, Fair, and upright as Roses on their Stalk: So trimly was the tidy Damsel dress'd. That, Spite of all the Flow'rs, she seem'd the best. Sometimes to smell a pretty Rose she stop'd, Pleas'd with the Smell, the pretty Rose she crop'd; Then in her snowy Breast the Fav'rite plac'd, Her sweeter Breast the blushing Fav'rite grac'd; But then! how did I wish myself between Her swelling Bosom, and the Flow'r, unseen? But as I wish'd, I found a pleasing Smart, I know not how, begin to melt my Heart: Nay, all my Limbs with such a Shiv'ring shook, That I the Chillness for an Ague took. Ah, had it been one, I had felt less Harm, For I can cure an Ague with a Charm! Now, all my Spells and Charms but Trifles prove, Far stronger are the magic Charms of Love. But when I found she smil'd to see me look, I pleas'd as well, soon laid aside my Book. And, boldly blithsome, to the Garden went, Where she, as well as I, knew what I meant; Yet seemingly my searching Sight to shun, Behind an Apple-Tree the Gipsy run; But soon I found the amorous Deceit, And forc'd a Kiss, to reconcile the Cheat. But forc'd it so, that when she seem'd to strive To keep it most, the more she seem'd to give. Remember then, my lovely faithless Maid, What Oaths, what Vows, what Promises, you made; Think for your own, if not your Lover's Sake, How bad it is a binding Oath to break. But while I thus these silly Tales repeat, I find my self already in a Sweat: What shall I do, too well she knows my Love, And her Coy Coldness does the Scorner prove. Well then—When Shadows length'ning o'er the Vale, Call forth the Milk-maid, with her cleanly Pail, To my old Sweet-heart Cicely will I go, And more than all my former Kindness show; Conduct the Girl along the crouded Mead, And to teaze Dolly, thro' the Pasture lead; Perhaps I'll whisper out some secret Place, And kiss her too before her jealous Face; Then let her Rival cry, and frown, and fret, And in my Cruelty her own forget. Then let her be as much, or more afraid Of Cicely, than she was the Parson's Maid. So shall my Scorn, and counterfeit Disdain Revive her Love, if any Love remain. Sid. Coll. April 5th 1725. TO Mr. JOHN SAUNDERS, Occasioned by a Sight of some of his Paintings at Cambridge. When Nature, from her unexhausted Mine, Resolves to make some mighty Science shine; Her Embryo-Seeds inform the future Birth, Improve the Soul, and animate the Earth; From thence, an Homer, or Apelles, rise, A Shakespeare, or a Saunders, strike our Eyes; And, lo! the promis'd Wonder charms my View, The old Apelles rivall'd in the New! See! like the Sun, his Beams their Pow'r disclose, Like him, he paints his Progress, as he goes; Renews the opening Spring's enlivening Dye, Or bids rich Autumn ripen to the Eye. Let some, elaborately vain, impart The cold Effects of Industry, and Art, Thy warmer Draughts deserve a nobler Name, Nature's thy Art, as Nature is thy Theme, Taught by thy Touch, the Lilly fairer blows, A softer Damask blushes in the Rose, And a more gay Creation from thy Pencil flows. Nor Flowers, nor Fruits alone, improv'd we see, But Beauty owes her Empire half to Thee: How bloom Belinda's never-fading Charms! How, in thy Paint, the fair Perfection warms! What pure Vermillion tinctures ev'ry Grace! How all the Goddess brightens in her Face! The mimic-rolling Eye, now seems to move, Dawns into Life, and kindles into Love; Struck, at each Look, a Captive of thy Art, I sigh! and fancy Arrows in my Heart: Confounded at thy nice, creative Hand, Think the Draught lives, and, like some Picture, stand. Would thus each Nymph, with providential Care, Ensure her Charms, and shine for ever fair, How might she brave the dire, detested Rage, Of Spleen, Small-Pox, or All-devouring Age! Then, when old Time should bid the Roses die, Pale the red pouting Lip, and dim the sparkling Eye, Then might the Fair a bright Reversion save, Bloom in her Death, and triumph in her Grave: Then Celia, spight of that bewitching Frown, Would see thy Paint more lasting than her own. But lo! more glorious Aims thy Hand pursues, More glorious Scenes attract the ravish'd Muse: Silent I stand, and, lost in Wonder, see, A Godhead shrouded in Mortality! What Majesty eclips'd thy Shades display! How thy Lights kindle with eternal Day! What Beams of Love! what pitying Tears are seen! Meltingly sad, yet solemnly serene! O Happy Artist! Live, for ever blest! Whence dawn'd this Heav'n-sprung Image in thy Breast? Sure some kind Angel, studious in thy Art, Ting'd the bright Dyes, and quicken'd every Part; Hence, like their Great Original, they shine, Appear as human, but are all Divine! What, may not now thy lively Touch command? What may not owe new Glories to thy Hand? Thy wond'rous Hand not only Nature drew, But copied ev'n the Lord of Nature too! Sidney-Coll Feb. 9. 1725–6. TO Mr. SAUNDERS, Occasioned by the breaking of the Glass of Mr. Eusden's Picture. Oft have I thought thy wonder-working Art, Could more than Nature's outward Form impart; But now my Eyes convinc'd the Truth believe, For lo! the Picture more than seems to live, Pleas'd to decide mistrusting Reason's Strife, Breaks thro' the Glass, and startles into Life. BURLESQUE. Dear Hulse, When Ovid in his Exile wrote, Low was his Verse, and barren was his Thought; My Case is just the same, and for to mock it, The Muse keeps equal Tenour with my Pocket; And for th' Assurance of a modern Poet, I think these Lines are Proof enough to show it. Rest that, howe'er, as 'twill—can I be-song ye, So as to get a little Cash among ye; This Week, by Carrier-Haswel, you may send it, And, may the Gods that guard the Roads defend it! With that inspir'd, a gorgeous Sword I'll buy me, And, plum'd with Hopes, to good Sir Robert hie me. Present my self with this new-modell'd Trifle, Which, should he chance to like, I'll lay my Life, He'll Make every Wish, a Bard can frame, succeed, And then my Muse, and I, are made indeed! But stay—One Word forgot—with Love commend me, To all such honest Fellows as befriend me With their Subscriptions—But I cannot on For Rhime—And so excuse your Pattison. P.S. Septemb. the twenty-fifth, or twenty-sixth As to my Lodging, for a Date, t'en't fix'd. N. B. For Memorandum, you may put once More, your Direction to your Friend, at Button's. A SESSION OF THE Cambridge POETS. By a vacant Preferment Apollo thought fit To settle the Bays, and establish a Wit, For his trusty Friend R???h, by much Merit and Grace, Had obtain'd in Elysium the Laureat's Place; Accordingly, to the fam'd Borders of Cam, Descended the God, with a Goddess hight Fame, The Figure she wore, as Dan Virgil declares Was illumin'd with Eyes, and becluster'd with Ears, (And Faith, as you'll find, she had of them all, To pick one good Poet, and hear ev'ry Call,) A Trumpet she blew, for a Trumpet she bore, As the laudable Custom informs us of yore. Thick as Bees, when they swarm to the tinkling Brass, The Bards flock around her, and darken the Place; Each Pretender, for such was Apollo's command, Brought his Works, and conducted his Muse in his Hand: But, good Lord! how his Godship at first was amaz'd, To find the chaste Nine to such Numbers were rais'd? However, to banish immodest Suspicions, He order'd a Silence, and heard the Petitions. B???ll first, as the Candidates jostled along, With a Gate most affected, emerg'd from the Throng. Apollo observ'd somewhat odd in his Look, And, giving a Beck, thus the Goddess bespoke. Prithee, what's that same Fellow? Some half-witted Beau? I don't know as ever I've seen him 'till now— Nor can I remember, I think, replies Fame, To have heard of his Worth, or so much as his Name: But Odds I will, lay by those Papers there brought, 'Tis the same, who the Place in the Memoirs has bought— Say, you so, cries Apollo, and is he so vain? Yet pshaw—'tis the only Place that he can gain. The Bard now elate with Ambition appear'd, Propos'd his Pretence, and desir'd to be heard; When Apollo strait bid him his Labours produce, And, for his Authority, bring him his Muse. More hasty, than wisely, the Labours were shown, But, alas, for the Muse, the sly Gipsey was flown, For her Birth it was mortal, nor could her feign'd Power Stand the Test of the Godhead she mimick'd before; O'eraw'd by the Deity no longer could stay, But like Spenser's false Florimel faded away! De V???l in the Tumult ran bawling aloud, And swore that he ought to be heard by the God, And heard too he was, for the God cut him short, And ask'd what Pretensions could draw him to Court! What Pretension, cries he! but the Godhead replies, Before you are witty, pray learn to be wise, And if, as they say, you are Lunatic grown, For I hear you converse with my Sister the Moon, In secret Confinement, a Purge or two try, And let your own Essay Bum-fodder supply. Next Ch???y roll'd onward, a Bard of renown, For Bulk and Bumbast super-eminent grown, Of Lampoons and Pindaricks huge Bundles he brought, But the Burthen was light, because barren of Thought, From railing at Friends, falsly smiling he came, Detraction his Pleasure, Ambition his Aim. But Apollo soon knew him, notwithstanding all Art, For your Gods at first Sight can discover the Heart. And told him, that Pride, and inhuman Backbitings Were the worst of all Evils,—except his own Writings; Ay, I see, cries the God, I see your Excuse— But hang it, that's nothing in Shape of a Muse!— I suppose, that it's term'd by you Mortals here, Satire, But we Gods have thought fit, to bename it Ill-nature. Besides such a Bulk, for high Flights was ne'er made well— And I mortally hate the Remembrance of Shadwell. Little R???th took the Hint, and right archly declar'd, That if Body diminutive distinguish'd the Bard, Then his Cause it was just,—but, to humour the Joke, With an affable Air, thus the Deity spoke; And told him, he could not Heroics right suit, For his Body, at full Length, was scarce more than one Foot. Ho, W???d! cries the God, as he saw him stand by, Come forward a little, and don't be so shy— I know you are modest; but harkee between us, Here, lookee this Token, 'twas sent you by Venus— For her Ladyship told me, some few Days ago, She came down in the Form of a Nymph that you know, And, pleas'd with a Copy or two of your Verses, Presents you this Myrtle—'twas wreath'd by the Graces— Here tak't,—'tis as good as my Laureat's Place is. H???se next he beheld with poetical Rage, And told him, 'twas pity he was not at Age— Nor mind, cries the God, those dull Fools, that desire to Eclipse that bright Merit,—they ne'er can aspire to; Just so, in a Morning, I see, as I rise Black Fogs, and dull Vapours usurping my Skies— But two Dramatists here, the mere Scum of the Gang, Broke the Simile short, and began to harangue; Four Acts of a Play, cries the one I have writ, And had I a Plot, then the Work were compleat; My Characters—go, cries the God, scribling Elf, And learn first to get thee a good one thy self. As Pattison stood unconcern'd in the Crowd, Apollo beheld him, and call'd him aloud; Declaring his Manners, tho' perhaps not his Wit, His identical Self to a Nicety hit; Alike their Employments, alike their Delight, Both rambled all Day, and both tipled all Night; Both us'd the same Haunts, both pursu'd the like Game, And Laura and Thetis but differ'd in Name. Now the Bard, without Doubt, the Reason acquir'd, But Woman, and Fate both against him conspir'd, For, unhappily! just as he drew up more nigh, A pretty tight Damsel came tripping it by; No longer the Laurel attracted his Eyes, They were fix'd on a far more desirable Prize— His Highness he thank'd; but resigning his Lays, Declar'd, that a Nymph was far better than Bays. Apollo now, tir'd with Debates and Confusion, Was glad for to draw his Affairs to Conclusion, And, sick at the Numbers still swarming around, Thrice T???r he call'd, but no T???r was found: Not here? (cries the God) oh! I guess at his Stay— He stole a few Poems of mine t'other Day— But, howe'er, I forgive him the cunning Device And, since his are my Labours, be his too my Prize. 1725–6. Rosamond to Henry: AN EPISTLE. Qualis populeâ mærens Philomela sub Umbrâ Flet Noctem ramoque sedens, miserabile Carmen Integrat, &amp; mæstis latè Loca Questibus implet. Virgil. Georg. From these lone Shades, and ever-gloomy Bowers, Once, the dear Scenes of Henry's softer Hours! What tender Strains of Passion can impart, The Pangs of Absence to an amorous Heart! Far, far too faint the Powers of Language prove, Language that slow Interpreter of Love! Souls pair'd like our's, like our's, to Union wrought, Converse by silent Sympathy of Thought; O then, by that mysterious Art, divine The wild Impatience of my Breast, by thine! And to conceive what I would say to thee, Conceive, my Love, what thou wou'dst say to me! As in the Tenderness of Soul I sigh, Methinks, I hear thy tender Soul reply; And as in Thought, o'er Heaps of Heroes slain, I trace thy Progress on the fatal Plain, Perhaps thy Thought explores me thro' the Grove, And, soft'ning, steals an Interval of Love. In the deep Covert of a bow'ring Shade Describes my Posture—languishingly laid! Now, sadly solac'd with the murm'ring Springs, Now, melting into Tears the softest Things! And how the feign'd Ideas all agree! So bowers the Shade, so melt my Tears for thee! Here, as in Eden, once we blissful lay; How oft Night stole, unheeded, on the Day! Our soft-breath'd Raptures charm'd the listening Grove, And all was Harmony, for all was Love! But hark! the Trumpet sounds! see Discords rise! 'Tis Honour calls; from me my Henry flies! Honour, to him, more bright, than Rosamonda's Eyes! Not thus my Honour with his Passion strove, His Sighs I pity'd, and indulg'd his Love: He then cry'd, Honour was an empty Name, And Love a sweeter Recompence, than Fame. Oh! had I liv'd in some obscure Retreat, Securely fair, and innocently sweet; How had I bless'd some humble Shepherd's Arms! How kept my Fame as spotless as my Charms! Then, hadst thou ne'er beheld these Eyes of mine, Nor they bewail'd the fatal Power of thine! Dear fatal Power! to me for ever dear— Fix'd in my tender Breast, and rooted there! For ever in my tender Breast remain— And be for ever a delightful Pain! With what Surprize those Glories first I view'd, That in one Moment my whole Heart subdu'd! With such resistless Beams, so fierce they shone, Not such the dazling Radiance of thy Crown! Sent from thy Crown I never felt a Dart; The Lover, not the Monarch, won my Heart: Nor e'er the Monarch with such Charms appears, As when the Lover's soften'd Dress he wears: As when he, silent, deigns my Breast to seek, And looks such Language, as no Tongue can speak. Whene'er my Crimes (if Love a Crime can be, If 'tis a Crime to live, and die for thee!) In hideous Forms arise, and cloud my Soul, One Thought on Henry can that Gloom controul: No more my Breast alternate Passions move, The Frosts of Honour melt before the Fires of Love. Again, I must repeat that fatal Hour, Which snatch'd my Henry from his Woodstock Bower; When mad Bellona, with tumult'ous Cries, The Heroe rouz'd, and drown'd the Lover's Sighs. Stretch'd on my downy Couch, at Ease I lay, And sought by Reading to beguile the Day; With am'rous Strains I sooth'd a grateful Fire, And all the Woman glow'd with soft Desire. Till, as I wish'd, I heard the vocal Breeze Proclaim my Henry rusling thro' the Trees; O'erjoy'd, I ran to meet thy longing Arms, And taste a dear Remembrance of thy Charms; But soon I saw some sad conceal'd Surprize, Fade on thy Cheeks, and languish on thy Eyes; Thro' each dissembled Smile, a Sorrow stole, And whisper'd out the Secret of thy Soul. What this could mean, uncertain to divine, No Fault I knew, yet fear'd, some Fault was mine. But soon thy Love dispell'd those airy Fears, Dispell'd alas!—but brought too solid Cares. For as with Hands, entwin'd in Hands, We walk'd, Of Love, and hapless Lovers, still Thou talk'd: Thy Tears of Pity answer'd each sad Moan, And in their seeming Mis'ries, wept thy own. “I cannot leave Her!—I o'er-heard Thee say,— Pierc'd to the Soul, I sunk, and dy'd away. What Art restor'd me, thou alone can'st tell, For thy kind Arms embrac'd me, as I fell. My opening Eyes, fix'd on thy Beauties, hung, And my Ears drunk the Cordial of thy Tongue. Again my Thoughts return with killing Pain, Within thy Arms I sink, and swoon again: Again thou do'st my sweet Physician prove, From Death to Life alternately I move, Now dead by Anguish, now reviv'd by Love. But when, without Disguise, the Truth I found, My agonizing Sorrows knew no Bound: My Locks I tore, then, all-intranc'd, I lay, Till by Degrees my Grief to Words gave Way, And soft I cry'd,—oh! stay, my Henry, stay. One Moment more!—add yet,—and yet, a Kiss!— Oh! give me Thine, and take my Soul in This! Farewel!—perhaps, farewel for ever!—oh! Who can sustain so dire a Weight of Woe? Ah! wretched Maid!—alas! a Maid no more! No Herbs that spotless Title can restore! Ah! who shall now protect thy injur'd Fame? Who shield thy Weakness from th' Assaults of Shame? Who lull thy anxious Soul to balmy Rest, If Henry, dearest Henry, flies thy Breast? Yet, tho' he flies, your Wings, ye Angels, spread, And hover Guardians o'er my Henry's Head! Who knows, but this kind Pray'r is pour'd too late, And he already struggles with his Fate? Already, wounded, pants, and gasps in Death, And Rosamonda is his latest Breath? Propitious Heaven! vouchsafe a gracious Ear! Grant, these be only Phantoms of my Fear: Heav'n still is gracious, if true Suppliants pray; And lo!—the foul Chimæras fleet away! Transporting Prospects to my Wishes rise, Beam on my Soul, and brighten in my Eyes! He lives! he lives! I see his Banner spread, And Laurels, wreath'd round the gay Victor's Head! Ye Winds! convey the News to Albion's Floods! Ye Floods! resound it to the joyous Woods! Ye joyous Woods! your tuneful Choirs prepare To hail my Heroe from the Toils of War! Delusive Scenes! too beautiful to stay! They fade in visionary Streaks away. Alas! no lovely Henry now is nigh! His Genius took his Form to sooth my Eye. No more I seem his melting Voice to hear! Peace! babling Fountains! nor abuse my Ear. Ye Flow'rs! ye Streams! ye Gales, no longer move! For ah! how strong is Fancy, join'd with Love! O! frail Inconstancy of mortal State! One Hour dejected, and the next elate! Rais'd by false Hopes, or by false Fears deprest, How different Passions sway the human Breast! Now smiling Pleasures, with fair Charms, invite, Now frowning Horrors, with black Trains, affright. Future Distrusts the present Joys controul, And Fancy triumphs o'er the reas'ning Soul. As 'mid the Trees I, solitary, rove, The Trees awake some Image of my Love: Where-e'er their Arms in am'rous Foldings join, My longing Arms I spread to fold in thine. The beauteous Flow'rs thy Face reflected bear, (If Flow'rs, in Beauty, may with thee compare,) Their wafted Fragrancies thy Breath inspire, And my Soul kindles with ideal Fire! The thick-weav'd Shades, and Grove incircling Grove, Are Emblems of th' Eternity of Love. My blushing Guilt the crimson Roses paint, And I, like Roses, unsupported faint: Like their's my youthful Charms (if Charms) consume, For Love, a closer Canker, eats my Bloom. How blest might other Nymphs survey these Scenes, Fountains, and Shades, and Hills, and flow'ry Greens? Prospects, on Prospects, might detain the Sight, And still Variety give new Delight. But I, with thee, should find in Desarts Ease; Without thee, not ev'n Paradise could please. Wilds, by thy Presence, Gardens would appear; Gardens are Wilds, since Henry is not here. Let Grottoes sink, or Porticoes arise! Heedless I view them with unpleasur'd Eyes: Their mantling Umbrage cools the Noon-day Fire, But what can cool a Lover's fierce Desire? In the deep Bosom of a darksome Shade, By baleful Eugh and mournful Cypress made; A Widow-Turtle weeps her ravish'd Love, And Sorrowfully solaces the Grove; Sometimes my Passion I aloud disclose; The widow'd Turtle, answering, coes her Woes. Bred by my Hand, my Sorrow's sad Relief, A little Linnet learns to sigh my Grief; Taught by my Voice, and by Obedience tame, The pretty Lisper whistles Henry's Name: Perch'd on my Head, the sylvan Syren sings, And tunes the harsher Notes of gurgling Springs. Embosom'd in a Vale, thou know'st the Shade, Fast by the Murmurs of a soft Cascade; There, while one Night full Beams of Cynthia play, (Warm was the Night) with wand'rings tir'd, I lay, Till, by Degrees, the falling Waters clos'd My Eye-lids, and my weary'd Limbs repos'd. Sudden the fairy Monarch I behold, Near he approach'd, and thus my Fate foretold: ('Twas the same Oberon, that once we saw Circle the Green, and give his Dancers Law,) Unhappy Nymph! thy Beauty is thy Crime, And must such Beauty perish in its Prime! No more great Henry shall enjoy these Charms, Nor thou ill-fated Fair adorn his Arms! Cropt like an op'ning Rose, thy Fall, I fear! But rise and supplicate the Vengeance near. Then (as methought) I wak'd with threaten'd Woes, Emerging from thick Shades, a Phantom rose. One Hand sustain'd—a short, but naked Sword,— And one a Golden Bowl, with Poison stor'd. The jealous Queen, the frowning Form express'd, It spoke, and aim'd the Dagger at my Breast. Arise! nor ask thy Crime—but chuse thy Fate, Know Prayers are vain—Repentance is too late! Vengeance is mine—Here! drink this poison'd Bowl, Or this keen Dagger drinks thy guilty Soul? It ceas'd: Convulsions in my Bosom strove, My curdling Blood scarce in stiff Tides could move. Thrice I cry'd, Henry, with a feeble Sound, And thrice I started at the sad Rebound! Ev'n Echo now grew frightful: with surprize Trembling I lay, nor dar'd t' unveil my Eyes, Till warbling Birds proclaim'd the Morning Light, And told me 'twas a Vision of the Night; Yet not the Morn could chace my gloomy Care, But Winds, and Trees, alarm'd my Soul with Fear; While waving Boughs, that in the Sun-Beams play'd, Seem'd to shew Daggers in each pointed Shade. Why was I form'd with such a coward Mind? The sport of Shadows, or a rustling Wind! Nerves, better strung, did manly Spirits warm, Glad would I part with ev'ry Female Charm, Then, cas'd in Steel, the Front of Battle dare, And, with great Henry, rouze the Soul of War! This Arm should guard the Heroe from the Foe, Repel the Storm, or intercept the Blow; And should my Weakness in the Warriour fail, The soft-beseeching Woman should prevail; For Thee, I'd sooth each proud insulting Foe, And melt him with petitionary Woe; With Thee, in ev'ry hardy Hazard join, In Dangers save thy Life, to make it Mine: By Night, compose thy harrass'd Soul to rest, And hush it on the Pillow of my Breast; With patient Eyes eternal Vigils keep, And court good Angels to protect thy Sleep. Alas! in vain I urge my frustrate Will, I find my self a feeble Woman still; The feeble Woman to my Breast returns, For Henry's gone, and Rosamonda mourns! O! see my Eyes their streaming Anguish pour, O! hear my Sighs increase the swelling Shower; What can I more than shed my Tears and Sighs? Poor Woman's Strength alone in Weakness lies? But whether is ungovern'd Fancy flown? Thoughts of Impossibilities be gone! Guilt claims no Miracles, nor Heav'n conspires To aid my Crimes, and fan my lawless Fires. Life irksome grows; detested is the Light, And my Soul dreads the Visions of the Night. Swift let me to some hallow'd Convent go!— Can I for ever Henry leave?—ah! No:— But O lost Innocence!—I lost a Name:— O Honour!—broken is the Bubble, Fame. Are my Sins monstrous? Do invented Crimes, Alike unknown to past, or present Times, Demand red Vengeance? Some peculiar Curse?— Crowds stand recorded for the same,—or worse. Have I, unpitying, heard the Poor complain, Or seen the Wretched weep, and weep in vain? Have I my Flame feign'd for a sordid End? E'er wrong'd a Foe, or e'er betray'd a Friend? Not to my Charge such Crimes has Malice brought, Love, only Love, is my unbounded Fault: A Fault, that sure may Heav'n to Pity move, Since half of Heav'n ('tis said) consists in Love. Ah! foolish Nymph!—Here, view the Queen! the Laws!— But there, view Henry, as th' inchanting Cause! By such a Cause the Priestess would retire, And quit the Vestal for a nobler Fire. I will again th' immortal Powers implore; Brave Henry for Britannia's sake restore! In Him she lives, to Him her Joys are due, And only fends her earliest Thanks to you. But O! my Lord, my darling Lord, beware! Tempt not too bold the Dangers of the War! Think, when thou seest the fate-impelling Dart, O! think it aim'd at Rosamonda's Heart! Were but each Breast as soft as mine! no more Should Tumults rise, or martial Thunders roar: Heroes should scorn the Glories of the Field, And the fam'd Laurel to the Myrtle yield: For sweeter Passions, sweeter Strifes inspire, And Love alone should set the Soul on Fire. May then these Eyes in Tears no longer mourn, But chearful hail their Henry's wish'd Return! O! swift, victorious, hush the War's Alarms! Swift, if thy Rosamonda boasts some Charms, Fly on the Wings of Love, and Conquest to her Arms! Octob. 20. 1725. Henry to Rosamond: AN EPISTLE. Shall then his beauteous Rosamonda mourn, Nor Henry's Soul the soft Complaint return! O cease, my Fair! I deeply feel thy smart, And all thy Sorrows double in my Heart: Far from my Breast, ye Scenes of War! remove, Far from my Breast be every Scene, but Love; Soft rising Thoughts as when, in Woodstock-Bowers, Joyful, we lov'd away the laughing Hours. Now mid-night Rest relieves the Soldier's Care, Hush'd are the Drums, and every Voice of War; Faint gleam the Fires along the dewy Field, And faint the Noise, that sleeping Coursers yield; Yet Love, the lordly Tyrant of my Breast, Alarms my Soul, and interrupts my Rest; In vain a Nation's Cares the Monarch move, For ah! far greater is the Monarch Love! Warm from my Lips, thy tender Letter lies, And every Word is Magick to my Eyes; Weeping, I read, and hear thy soft-breath'd Woes, And all the Warriour in the Lover lose: Then I by Fancy vanish'd Joys restore, Feast on false Love, and act past Pleasures o'er; Fancy can sooth my Soul with pleasing Dreams, While tented Gallia, bowery Woodstock seems; Led by delusive Steps, in Thought, I rove Thro' well known Greens, and every winding Grove. There, haply on some flowery Bank reclin'd My sweet-reposing Rosamonda find; When then (for then thy secret Thoughts I see) In pious Slumbers breath'st thy Soul to me; Dissolv'd with Joy, and feasting on thy Charms, I clasp thee in imaginary Arms; And then—ah then!—I seem sincerely blest— Then only Rosamonda, knows the rest— O Glories! Empires! Crowns! how weak ye prove, If thus out-rivall'd by a Dream of Love! O Love! what Toys thy real Sweets bestow, When ev'n their Shadows can transport me so! O Bliss extatick! blest Relief from Cares! Thus let me lose my Soul in softer Wars! Be Love's transporting Sighs my sweet Alarms, Nor Worlds, but Rosamonda crown my Arms! In Her alone, my full Desires agree, Her Charms are Empires, Glories, all to Me! THE HOUR-GLASS. As in my silent Study late I sate, Intent on Poets poor precarious State, Around my Sight a sudden Dimness play'd, And ting'd the Taper with a blewy Shade; When to my Eyes appear'd that watchful Power Which measures out the sandy-streaming Hour, An human Form the meagre Phantom wore, And on its Brow a faded Laurel bore: On me were fix'd its Looks, whilst thus it spoke, And Sounds like these the solemn Silence broke. “At length the Time is come to tell a Truth “To thee, to thee alone, O fated Youth! “Then mark my Story well—in happier Days, “Like thine, my Bosom panted after Praise; “Foe to the grave Fatigues of Life, I strove “To grow immortal in a Myrtle-Grove: “Lost there, I lavish'd out my little Store, “Destin'd to live poetically poor; “What slender Gains my Labours brought, I spent, “And thro' the Glass my luscious Profit went; “From thence, with fictious Inspiration warm'd, “A vain Eternity's Reversion charm'd; “My Fate I bless'd,—for future Fame reserv'd! “For that I glory'd! and for that I—starv'd! “Thence, by some pow'rful Transmigration turn'd, “In these repentant Streams my Folly mourn'd: “Here, as you see, my fleeting Minutes pass, “Still, as of old, devoted to the Glass. “As once, too humble for proud Rooms of State, “In homely Cottages I seek my Fate, “And find my vast Poetic promis'd Land “All dwindled to this little barren Sand; “With which advise, ye youthful Sons of Rhime, “In abler Studies to employ your Time; “Warn'd by my Fate, to learn, for learn you must, “That all your Fame, like mine, but turns to Dust. The Cambridge Beauties. By an Admirer of the Fair Sex. Ye gentle Nymphs, to whom my Lays belong, Approve my Numbers, and assist my Song; Soft-smiling may your bright'ning Eyes inspire At once the Poet's, and the Lover's Fire: So shall the Muse each magic Charm rehearse; So shall each Charm be lasting as her Verse. Bless'd in my Choice! what blooming Beauties rise! How court my Numbers with inspiring Eyes! O could my Lays like gentle Waller move, Like gentle Waller tune the Soul to Love; Bright as my Theme, each easy Note should shine, And Sacharissas Smile in ev'ry Line. To Aurenelia, fam'd Carlisle should yield, And Waller own his fav'rite Fair excell'd: Had Charms like Her's inspir'd his lofty Lays, How had he grown immortal in Her Praise! How might the Muse Her wonted Gift receive, And Poetry from Beauty learn to live! When Sylvia smiles, methinks, she smiles to prove Her Charms superiour to the Power of Love. Gay-sportive Cupids flutter round the Fair, Pant on her Breast, and wanton in her Hair; With ev'ry Lock, a new Adorer gain, And ev'ry Ringlet is a Lover's Chain; The Orbit Ringlets, soft dissolving down, Flow on her Breast, and half her Bosom drown; Thro' the bright Shades, her panting Bubbies heave, Like Swans emerging from a silver Wave. On Delia's Cheeks, eternal Roses bloom, Her ruby Lips exhale a sweet Perfume; Her ruby Lips indulge a mutual Kiss, And blush luxuriant in their envy'd Bliss. When bright Belinda leads the sprightly Dance, With ev'ry Step, our captive Hearts advance; Her magic Charms the soft Enchantress prove, And on her Breast descends the God of Love Smiling, she seems to imitate those Airs, That form their Regularity by Her's; Moves, as the Soul-dissolving Numbers move; And musically swims the Maze of Love: On the soft Sounds, her gentle Motions flow, And sail along majestically slow: Her waving Arms in snowy Circles play And all the easy Conquerour display; Melodious Music warbles Love's Alarms, Sounds the soft Charge, and sings her conqu'ring Charms. When Flora sings, ye Gods! 'tis Heav'n to hear, We listen to the Music of the Sphere; Our ravish'd Sight confirms the sweet Surprize And owns the Angel, by her heav'nly Eyes. But, O! my Muse, your tunefull'st Charms prepare, Harmonious, as your Aurenelia's fair. Where-e'er she looks, her Eyes like Lightnings wound, Whene'er she speaks, there's Music in the Sound; From her dear Lips such melting Softness flows, Soft as when Zephirs kiss the silken Rose: But when the wond'rous Charmer talks of Love, Good Gods! what Raptures in our Bosom move! How each Discourse our Soul transported warms, And, if 'tis possible, improves her Charms. O ever beauteous, ever lovely Fair, Pride of my Verse, and Object of my Care. O take me, clasp me, melting in thy Arms, Unfold thy Sweets, and open all thy Charms On those dear Breasts for ever let me rove, Those Breasts to me the true Poetic Grove! On those soft Hills for ever let me sing, And sip thy sacred Heliconian Spring. Were Paris here to judge fair Beauty's prize, How might these brighter Goddesses surprize; How could his Choice the doubtful Favour place, When a new Venus shines in ev'ry Face? But since that Task, that pleasing Task I claim, O Venus guide me to a brighter Flame: To Aurenelia's Charms my Wishes move, Warm her cold Heart, and tune her Breast to Love; There, let my Soul a nobler Prize impart, And for an Apple, give my bleeding Heart. ABELARD to ELOISA. In my dark Cell, low prostrate on the Ground, Mourning my Crimes, thy Letter Entrance found; Too soon my Soul the well known Name confest, My beating Heart sprung fiercely in my Breast; Thro' my whole Frame a guilty Transport glow'd, And streaming Torrents from my Eyes fast flow'd. O Eloisa! art thou still the same? Dost thou still nourish this destructive Flame? Have not the gentle Rules of Peace, and Heaven From thy soft Soul this fatal Passion driven? Alas! I thought you disengag'd, and free, And can you still, still sigh, and weep for me? What pow'rful Deity, what hallow'd Shrine, Can save me from a Love, a Faith, like Thine? Where shall I fly, when not this awful Cave, Whose rugged Feet the surging Billows lave; When not these gloomy Cloister's solemn Walls, O'er whose rough Sides the languid Ivy crawls; When my dread Vows, in vain, their Force oppose, Opposing Love, alas! how vain are Vows! In fruitless Penance here I wear away Each tedious Night, each sad revolving Day: I fast, I pray; and with deceitful Art Veil thy dear Image from my tortur'd Heart. My tortur'd Heart conflicting Passions move, I hope, despair, repent, but still I love. A thousand jarring Thoughts my Bosom tear, For Thou, not God, my Eloisè art there. To the false World's deluding Pleasures dead, No longer by its wand'ring Fires misled; In learn'd Disputes, harsh Precepts I infuse, And give that Counsel, I want Pow'r to use. The rigid Maxims of the Grave, and Wise, Have quench'd each milder Sparkle in my Eyes; Each lovely Feature of this well-known Face, By Grief revers'd, assumes a sterner Grace: O Eloisa! would the Fates once more (Indulgent to thy Wish) this Form restore, How wouldst thou from these Arms with Horror start, To miss those Charms, familiar, to thy Heart! Nought could thy quick, thy piercing Judgment see, To speak thy Abelard, but Love of thee: Lean Abstinence, pale Grief, and haggard Care, The dire Attendants of forlorn Despair; Have Abelard the gay, the young, remov'd, And in the Hermit, sunk the Man you lov'd. Wrapt in the Gloom these holy Mansions shed, The thorny Paths of Penitence I tread; Lost to the World, from all its Interest free, And torn from all my Soul held dear in thee; Ambition, with its Train of Frailties, gone, All Loves, all Forms forgot, but thine alone. Amidst the Blaze of Day, and Dusk of Night, My Eloisa rises to my Sight; Veil'd, as in Paraclete's Sea-bath'd Tow'rs, The wretched Mourner counts the lagging Hours; I hear her Sigh, see the swift-falling Tears, Weep all her Griefs, and pine with all her Cares. O Vows! O Convents! your stern Force impart, And frown the melting Phantom from my Heart; Let other Sighs a worthier Sorrow show, Let other Tears, for Sin, repentant flow; Low to the Earth, my guilty Eyes I roll, And humble to the Dust my contrite Soul. Forgiving Pow'r! your gracious Call I meet, Who first impower'd this rebel Heart to beat; Who thro' this trembling, this offending Frame, For nobler Ends diffus'd Life's active Flame: O change the Temper of this throbbing Breast, And form a-new each beating Pulse to rest! Let springing Grace, fair Faith and Hope remove, The fatal Traces of voluptuous Love; Voluptuous Love from his soft Mansion tear, And leave no Tracks of Eloisa there. Are these the Wishes of thy inmost Soul? Would I its softest tend'rest Peace controul? Would I, thus touch'd, this gloomy Heart resign To the cold Substance of the Marble Shrine? Transform'd like these pale Saints that round me move, O bless'd Insensibles! that knew not Love! Ah! rather let me keep this hapless Flame, Adieu, false Honour, unavailing Fame! Not your harsh Rules, but tender Love, supplies The Streams that gush from my despairing Eyes: I feel the Traytor melt around my Heart, And thro' my Veins with treach'rous Influence dart! Inspire me Heav'n! assist me, Grace divine! Aid me ye Saints! unknown, to Crimes like mine! You, while on Earth, all Pangs severe could prove, All but the tort'ring Pangs of hopeless Love. An holier Rage in your pure Bosoms dwelt, Nor can you pity what you never felt: A sympathizing Grief alone can cure, The Hand that heals, must feel, what I endure. Thou Eloisè! alone, canst give me Ease, And bid my strugling Soul subside in Peace; Restore me to my long lost Heav'n of Rest, And take thy self from my reluctant Breast: If Crimes, like mine, could an Allay receive, That bless'd Allay, thy wond'rous Charms must give. Thy Form, which first my Heart to Love inclin'd, Still wanders in my lost, my guilty Mind: I saw thee as the new-blown Blossoms fair, Sprightly as Light, and soft as Summer-Air; Wit, Youth, and Beauty, in each Feature shone, Bless'd by my Fate, I gaz'd, and was undone! There dy'd the gen'rous Fire, whose vig'rous Flame, Enlarg'd my Soul, and urg'd me on to Fame; Nor Fame, nor Wealth, my soften'd Heart could move, My Heart, insensible to all but Love! Snatch'd from my self, my Learning tasteless grew, And vain, Philosophy, oppos'd to you. A Train of Woes we mourn; nor should we mourn, The Hours that cannot, ought not, to return; As once to Love, I sway'd thy yielding Mind, Too fond, alas! too fatally inclin'd! To Virtue now let me thy Breast inspire, And fan, with Zeal divine, the holy Fire; Teach you to injur'd Heav'n, all chang'd to turn, And bid thy Soul with sacred Raptures burn. O that my own Example could impart This noble Warmth to thy soft trembling Heart! That mine, with pious undissembled Care, Might aid the latent Virtue strugling there! Alas, I rave! nor Grace, nor Zeal divine, Burns in a Breast o'erwhelm'd with Crimes like mine: Too sure I find (whilst I the Fortune prove Of feeble Piety, conflicting Love) On black Despair, my forc'd Devotion built, Absence, to me, has greater Pangs than Guilt. Ah! yet, my Eloisè, thy Charms I view, Yet my Sighs break, and my Tears flow for you; Each weak Resistance stronger knits my Chain, I sigh, weep, love, despair, repent in vain! Haste Eloisa, haste, thy Lover free, Amidst thy warmer Pray'rs, O think of me! Wing with Thy rising Zeal my grov'ling Mind, And let me Mine, from thy Repentance find: Ah! labour, strive, thy Love, thy self controul, The Change will sure affect my kindred Soul: In blest Concert our purer Sighs shall grieve, And, Heav'n assisting, shall our Crimes forgive. But if unhappy, wretched, lost in vain, Faintly th' unequal Combat you sustain: If not to Heaven you feel your Bosom rise, Nor Tears, refin'd, fall contrite from your Eyes: If still thy Heart thy wonted Passions move, And thy Tongue prompts thy tender Soul to Love; Deaf to the weak Essays of living Breath, Attend the stronger Eloquence of Death. When that kind Pow'r this captive Soul shall free, (Which, only then, can cease to doat on thee) When gently sunk to my eternal Sleep, The Paraclete my peaceful Urn shall keep; Then Eloisa, then, thy Lover view, See, these quench'd Eyes, no longer fix'd on you, From their dead Orbs that tender Uttrance flown, Which first on Yours my Heart's soft Tales made known. This Breath no more; at length, to Ease consign'd, Pant, like light Aspines quiv'ring with the Wind; See, all my wild tumultuous Passions o'er, And thou, amazing Scene! belov'd no more: Behold the destin'd End of human Love, But let the Sight thy Zeal alone improve; Let not thy conscious Soul, with Sorrow mov'd, Recal how much, how tenderly you lov'd! With pious Care thy fruitless Grief restrain, Nor let a Tear thy sacred Veil prophane; Nor e'en a Sigh on my cold Urn bestow, But let thy Breath with sacred Rapture glow; Let Love divine, frail mortal Love, dethrone, And to thy Mind immortal Joys make known; Let Heav'n, relenting, strike thy ravish'd View, And still the bright, the blest Pursuit, renew: So, with thy Crimes, shall thy Misfortunes cease, And thy wreck'd Soul be calmly hush'd to Peace. TO The last (King George's) Guinea. Inscribed to the Right Honourable Sir Robert Walpole. What Call, bright Monarch! can engage thy Breast, To leave thy Loyal Subject thus distrest? Who knows, my Guardian-Aid, when thou art gone, What foreign Tyrant will usurp thy Throne? When Want, rebellious, arrogates thy Reign, What equal Power shall Faction's Rage restrain? Too well, alas! my future State I see, I can but sigh, and only think of Thee! So, when thy bright Original repairs To foreign Realms, with equal Griefs and Cares: Britannia mourns; and anxious for her Fate, Implores some Favourite to protect the State; Wisely, as still, the Monarch makes his Choice, And for his Walpole joins the general Voice. O, couldst thou there advance an equal Claim, Repos'd in him, our Safety were the same! Auspicious Thought! and with what Ease may He, Who has secur'd Three Nations, succour Me. To a Needle, that pricked his Mistress's Finger. From BONEFONIUS. Miracle of Cruelty! Must my Laura bleed by thee? Her Finger too, endure the Smart? That tender, inoffensive Part! What could the sweet Offender do, Soft, and fair, as falling Snow; To suffer innocently too! Was it not Envy caus'd this Hate, Because thy self wert found less strait? Did not this thy Fury move To wound the brighter Queen of Love? But, ah! then dreadful Foe, forbear To execute thy Fury here; Yet, if you still to Rage incline, Revenge at once, your Cause, and mine: Let her obdurate Bosom feel The angry Fury of thy Steel. Her Bosom! soft as Turtle's Down, Yet harder than the hardest Stone! Her Bosom! colder than the Snow, Burning at once, and freezing too, Will brave thy fiercest, deadliest Blow. Here infix thy piercing Dart, Deep as Love has pierc'd my Heart: Then, if thou gain'st the Victory, How wond'rous will the Conquest be? To win a Fortress that withstood The utmost Fury of a God; At once thy small, yet glorious Dart Shall conquer Love's, and Laura's Heart. On LAURINDA. When Nature fram'd Laurinda, heavenly fair, With each attractive Charm, and winning A Minerva's Eloquence refin'd her Tongue, Charm'd in her Speech, and warbled in her Song; Imperial Majesty from Juno came, Sooth'd with the Softness of the Cyprian Dame. O! wou'd some other Powers employ their Care, To make her kind, as these have made her fair, That single Act should all the rest out-shine, And make the fair Perfection all Divine. THE BEE and CUPID. From THEOCRITUS. As Cupid in a flow'ry Valley stray'd, Where Bees around their Hives in Clusters play'd, The Honey's fragrant Scent allur'd his Nose, And to the Hive, the groaping Archer goes. Boldly he thrusts his roguish Fingers in— Nor in that Heaven of Sweets could fear a Sting— But soon he merited, and met his Fate, Repenting of his Roguery, too late; And now, in vain, he frets, he stamps, he tears The flowing Honours of his waving Hairs; Deep is the Wound, alas! what can he do! Revenge he Vows, but then he fears the Foe? Now, swift as Thought, to Ida's Grove he flies, And thus, complaining, to his Mother cries, Alas! Mamma, what Pain my Hand endures! O take it, kiss it, cool it, rub 't with yours. Searching for Honey, I this Torment found, Small was the Author, but O! deep the Wound— To whom the Mother Goddess thus reply'd, Unkindly laughing, while poor Cupid cry'd. Fie, fie, is this your Courage, mighty Love! And is a Bee a stronger Foe than Jove? Hence Child, compassionate each Lover's Heart, Since you are conquer'd by so small a Dart. TO AN Old Lady that used to Paint. Kneller, with animating Art, could trace, The magick Wonders of a lovely Face; His nice creating Fancy could impart, Fire to each Charm, and Flames to ev'ry Heart; Yet all this Skill could but at best command A fancy'd Goddess at the second-hand. You, brighter Nymph, can greater Wonders show, And all this superficial Art out-do; What if his Hand a seeming Life could give, Your greater Wonder more than seems to live! His Nymph, at best, could only raise our Fire, But you Create, and satisfy Desire. To One who blamed me for Writing in Praise of a very undeserving Lady. I Own, my Friend, Olivia is not fair, An aukard Creature with a slattern Air; She's Nature's Error, I confess indeed, What then? the Sick alone the Doctor need: Thus cunning Tradesmen praise their paltry Ware, And cry, the very best in all the Fair; But let the Diamonds sparkle into Fame, And each Spectator with their Worth inflame. When Fancy's in her Infancy, the Muse Some trivial Theme, in trifling Lays, pursues, Till, by Degrees, she takes a loftier Aim And crowns her Actions with immortal Fame. Thus the keen Sword that's bath'd in Heroes Blood, First, to be temper'd, drinks the filthy Flood. AN Unseasonable Surprize. As Tom laid Moll beneath a Shade, To play a Game for Maidenhead; With smacking Buss, and Chuck 'o th' Chin, The Prologue to the future Scene! He thus address'd his bowzy Molly, Nay, pish, this Coyness is a Folly! Unwilling? blush? nay, pshaw—my Dear! My Love, came we for Nothing here? Alas! quoth she, should I prove fruitful! You know, at best, that would but suit ill— Pish, then, if that's thy Care, my Moll, There's one Above provides for all— To which, quoth Sly, upon the Tree, Your Brats, and you, be Damn'd for me. Presenting Waller's Poems to a Lady. Madam, Accept the softest sweetest Strains, That ever breath'd a dying Lovers Pains; That ever yet could unsuccessful prove, When arm'd with all the Eloquence of Love; And if you find some tender moving Part, Soften your Soul, and steal upon your Heart; (For sure the most obdurate Maid must blame, The rigid Coyness of the Cruel Dame:) Then lovely Laura, think, you faintly feel The Symptoms of a Flame I dare not tell, Think, then, you hear your suppliant Lover sigh, But generously, more than see him dye; And if you kindly listen to his Pain, Successful Waller has not sung in vain. TO A Lady at King's-College Chapel, Cambridge. Unskill'd in Love, unpractis'd in those Arts Of gaining Mistresses, and giving Hearts, Mix'd with the gazing Croud I hither come, Nor dreamt Destruction near this sacred Dome; Where holy Hymns, and solemn Songs of Praise, A venerable Adoration raise; But with Surprize, at once I hear and see A speaking, and a silent Harmony: Transporting Sounds! my fainting Senses rise, Wing'd with the sweeter Musick of your Eyes: Your Eyes, that speak a Form so bright, so fair, You seem the Object of each fervent Prayer. Our Souls the sweet Divinity adore— Aspiring Vanity can hope no more— But ah! forbear, thou holy Fair, unknown, Our Happiness to hazard by your own; Can Heaven, impartial, to your Hopes comply, And give you that, which you to all deny. Mistaken Maid! you think you Blessings gain, When 'tis your very Prayers create our Pain, And save us, but to kill us, with Disdain. Alas! I feel the fatal Poison run, I gaze, I sigh, I love, and am undone— Harmonious Charms, in vain, my Mind reprove, They sympathize, and melt, with me, to Love: Whilst, in soft Sounds, my Soul, transported, flew, Mistook her Heav'n, but found a Heav'n in You. ????????????? A TALE. For Arms to shield the Phrygian Knight, In warm Encounters, vent'rous Fight, Her Cuckold, Venus coax'd one Day, The Gipsey has a winning Way, She press'd, he melted, she was blest; Who would not melt when Venus prest? The blended Ore now thrice had boil'd, The Cavern smoak'd, the Cyclops toil'd; Work of a God! the Arms appear, Arms! might beseem a God to wear; But which provided Mettle sheen, The Lemnian King, or Paphian Queen, Is still in Doubt— Though, if we state the Matter fair, The Wife had sure the most to spare; And could you think it better done, To make, than to preserve a Son? But waving this—the Arms were wrought, And to the Trojan Heroe brought, With Joy, he took the wond'rous Boon, Made a rough Scrape, and put 'em on; For Soldiers then (unlike these now) Knew better how to Fight, than Bow. Thus far, all Matters went to please ye, Venus was merry; Vulcan easy; For he, unless inspir'd by Drinking, Was not addicted much to Thinking; But soon a solemn Feast ensu'd, For which, much Nectar had been brew'd: Jove's Wedding-Day (O Day of Thrall!) And now the Gods were summon'd all To Meet, and Tipple in his Hall. Old Vulcan came among the rest, To raise the Mirth, improve the Jest; Too weak his Brains were for a Drinker, Jove, therefore, wisely made him Skinker. With Hand unsteady, Feet unsound, And aukard Gaite, he limp'd around. 'Twas Dian's Turn (a prudish Lass, Who, spite of Thirst, would baulk her Glass.) You Prudes (quoth Vulcan half in Jest) Refuse a good Thing, tho' home-prest— Endymion once—come, make no Rout, But take your Cup, or all shall out. Here (whether thro' Effect of Guilt, Or his rude Push) the Wine was spilt: Her mantling Blood soon spoke her Ire, Her glowing Cheeks; Eyes darting Fire; For why? by double Motion pain'd, Her Rep, and Petticoat were stain'd. Hence! hammer Arms (cry'd she, thou Dastard) For thy lewd Wife's vile Trojan Bastard— I own indeed—so never fret— 'Tis Justice to repay a Debt; And sure enough God Mars, and she, Long since, a Head-Piece made for Thee; He scoul'd, She pouted, Venus maunder'd, And all protested they were slander'd. The Bowl was out, the Gods arise, 'Tis said, more merry too than wise; And each, Salutes and Congees ended, With Steps unsteady, homeward tended; The moody Vulcan and his Bride, Together pac'd it Side by Side; In Silence sad their Pace they steer, (He dumb thro' Rage, She aw'd by Fear) To Lemnos-Isle, (a smoaky Place, Dire Enemy to beauteous Face) Arriv'd! his Anger long ypent, Now lab'ring upwards, gain'd a Vent— Must I for Brats!—but Talk is vain— Look, Madam, yonder stands your Chain. From Marriage-Vows so oft to trip— Here! Polyphemus! bring the Whip.— But stop, my Muse, nor be it nam'd, How Venus' Body was profan'd; Those who would more, let them enquire Of that base Tribe, devoid of Fire; Who think to court their Goddess Grace, By Imitation of her Case; Wretches, with Passions gross, and dull, By Jilts, and Bawds term'd Flogging-Cull. Suffice it, each their Weapon us'd, She was well beaten, He abus'd: But from that Day, with Iron sated, Its very Name's by Venus hated. Her Warriour's Valour, you may note, Lies seldom deeper than the Coat; Captains of Blood, who scorn the Guilt, Nor e'er saw more of Sword than Hilt; For these her Sons, without the aid Of Spouse, new Armour she has made! Hence the old Churl's rejected Ware, His Brass, and Steel, are banish'd far; Their Coat of Mail, the Gift of Love, Is soft, and pliant as a Glove; The interceptive Shield they bear, Fit only too for Love to wear: On this, no Images are plac'd, Of Ages present, Ages past; The Wolf-nurst-Twins, the Rise of Rome, The ravish'd Sabines, Metius' Doom; Were cautelously banish'd hence, Lest the rough Surface damp the Sense: Its Colour, as you here may view, A dirty Yellow, bound with Blue; Of Parent wave, from whence it came, Still mindful, the Idalian Dame, Ordains it shall all Sizes fit, Provided, that it first be wet; And, when put off to End of Time, Should smell of Fish, and feel of Slime. Safely the well-cas'd Warriour goes, Thro' Squadrons of the Goddess, Foes, The Buboe, Cordee, and Phymosis, The Shanker, Ficus, Exostocis; (With all the numerous Store of Ills, St. Thomas cures, and Drury feels) Nor need when each, or all appear, Give back, or seem appall'd with Fear, These Arms, preventive, render vain, Apollo, and his idle Train; By these defended, he lays by, Now useless grown, each old Ally: Lint, Syringe, Gally-Pot, and Phial, And, Self-Protective, stands the Trial. The FOP. Sir Plume, the Banker, of each trading Lass, (That newest French Edition of an Ass!) Charm'd by dear Self, with Love may safely sport, (As Things inanimate receive no Hurt) On his own beauteous Person, deeply read, No Love e'er reach'd his Heart, no Thought his Head; Pangless, he woos some pangless Dame of Fashion, And, in bad French, serenely lisps his Passion; Then, as the Suit he makes is Right, or Wrong, Triumphs in Rigadoon, or dies in Song. The Refusal of Her Hand. I That with an Eagle's piercing Eye, Ned look'd, what Man with Eyes can doubt, When from the feather'd Family, He singled this fair Chicken out. II A Lion's Heart, the gen'rous Boy Proudly, in ev'ry Act maintains, Bravely attacks the Nymph, when coy, When yielding, bravely he disdains. III To play the skilful Surgeon's part, Two necessary Points are gain'd; But to be Master of his Art, Poor Ned still wants the Lady's Hand. THE Morning Contemplation. As I range these spacious Fields, Feast on all that Nature yields; Ev'ry Thing conspires Delight, Charms my Smell, my Taste, my Sight; Ev'ry rural Sound I hear Sooths my Soul, and tunes my Ear. Yonder azure Hills arising, Peeping thro' the wide Horizon; Strive for the Priority, Which shall first salute my Eye: Gentle Winds, each Sweet adorning, Breathe the wholsome Breath of Morning; Birds, on blossom'd Hawthorns, sing Jocund Carols to the Spring; Hopping o're the fragrant Lawn, Merrily salute the Dawn, And with their Musick seem to chide Man's Ingratitude and Pride. O venerable Solitude! Best of Blessings, chiefest Good! Chiefest Good! for in You is Ev'ry Part of Happiness: No racking Passions here controul, The peaceful Surface of my Soul; Nothing can my Bliss destroy, Whilst I thus my self enjoy. E'er the Heavens or Earth were made, Or their vast Foundations laid; E'er Angels yet were taught to sing, To tune the Lyre, or touch the String; In God-like Pomp the great Three-One Reign'd in their Solitude alone. Tell me, all ye mighty Wise, Ye Governours of Colleges? What deeper Wisdom can ye know, Than easy Nature's Works here show? All the lonesome Night ye pore, Philosophick Sages o'er: To what prodigious vast Account Can all your mighty Works amount? The wise Man was as wise as You, And yet his Wisdom was, He nothing knew. Come, ye Covetous! ye Proud! Come ye wise fantastick Croud! And as your Follies ye discern, Nature's plain Instructions learn. See, this River, as it goes, With what Eloquence it flows? How clear the Water, and how fine! How deep, how rapidly serene! But should it fearful of Decay, Stagnate, and stop up its Way; No longer would its Streams appear, Wholsome, delicate, or clear: But bury'd in a Quagmire sink, Or in a choaking Deluge stink. Believe me, Life's the very same, The very Image of this Stream: If of future Fortune, fearless, If of present Changes, careless, It uninterrupted goes, How sweet! and how serene it flows! But if stopt with these Restraints, Present Ills, and future Wants; If anxious Doubts, and clogging Care, Betray our Reason to Despair; Life's dull Enjoyment only cloys, And painfully it self destroys. View this reverential Shade! Sacred to Retirement made! What surprizing Sweets surround me! What Varieties confound me! Bless'd, in this obscure Abode, I think my self almost a God! I think my self so too the more, Because I'm out of Envy's Pow'r! And if Angels envious be, They alone dare Envy me; And doing so, they let me know I am happier here below. Where is self-enamour'd Pride! Tinsel Vanity beside: In what gilded Rooms of State, Shaking with the Storms of Fate, Do they now luxurious lye, Bound in purple Slavery? Can their artificial Flowers Rival these delightful Bowers? Compar'd with Nature's Charms, how faint Is their mimick-colour'd Paint? I, the living Forest have, They, the empty Shadows crave; Yet, in spite of all their Theft, I too have better Shadows left. Behold this little scrubby Thorn, Of Verdure destitute, forlorn, As if it were e'en Nature's Scorn. Yet this, is of much more possess'd, Than any Tyrant of the East; Is richer; nay, is happier far Than Oriental Monarchs are: Can, with equal Grandeur, show, Its brillant Head with Diamonds glow: And contented, knows, next Day Doubly will the Loss repay, If Fortune snatches it away. Princely Honours thus remain, And thus they flee—but ne'er return again— By this flow'ry Meadow walking, To this pratling Echo talking; As along the Stream I pass, Gazing on my floating Face; Lo! the ruffling Winds arise, To snatch the Prospect from my Eyes: The mimick Form their Fury braves, And proudly triumphs o'er the Waves; Yet, tho' with every Wave 'tis tost, The Reflexion is not lost. Virtue wages such a Strife, In this turbulent Stream of Life; Rack'd with Passions, tost with Fears, Vext with Jealousies, and Cares: But a good unspotted Soul, Tho' subject, yet knows no Controll, Whilst it turns on Virtue's Pole. But, Lo! the Clouds obscure the Sun, Swift Shadows o'er the Waters run! Trembling too, my Shadow flies? And by its very Likeness dyes. Hence learn, reflecting Pattison, How silent Fate still hurries on, How suddenly you must be gone! And as you now can tell no more, The Likeness that your Visage wore, On the Surface of the Flood, Where but now you gazing stood: So, as soon as you shall dye, And resign Mortality; The delusive Breath of Fame, Shall forget your very Name. THE INDIFFERENT: Wrote to a Gentleman in Love. I If from the Lustre of the Sun, To catch your fleeting Shade you run, In vain is all your Haste, Sir; But if your Feet reverse their Pace, The Fugitive will urge the Chace, And follow you as fast, Sir. II Thus, if at any Time, as now, Some scornful Chloe you pursue, In Hopes to overtake Her; Besure you ne'er too eager be, But look upon 't—as cold as she, And seemingly forsake Her. III So I, and Laura, t'other Day, Were coursing round a Cock of Hay, While I could ne'er o're-get Her; But, when I found I ran in vain, Quite tir'd, I turn'd me back again, And, flying from Her, met Her. VERSES, Occasioned by the Fifth of November. Mourn, Rome! thy baffled Arts, thy conquer'd Arms, For know! 'tis Heav'n thy impious Zeal disarms; Learn by thy Fate, and oft-experienc'd Cost, Our Temples still the true Palladium boast: With Shame review that dire vindictive Day, When hostile Nations plow'd the liquid Way; With rebel Rage inspir'd, but ah! how vain They brav'd the Cynthia of our British Main! Wing'd with false Hopes, their floating Cities flew, Like Sodom, doom'd to flaming Vengeance too: Immortal Drake, the British Thunder drove, Swift, as the Bolt, hot-hissing from above; Wide o'er the Main, the bright Infection flew, And flying, with tempestuous Fury grew; Reflecting Billows shot a gleamy Glare, And boil'd, and flam'd, with Elemental War; From the deep Cavern of his ouzy Bed, Old Ocean's Sire emerg'd his azure Head; Like scorching Xanthus, felt his Floods retire, And roar'd in Anguish at the God of Fire: But when he saw Britannia's Peace alarm'd, And Heav'n, and Drake, with sacred Vengeance arm'd; With billowing Storms he urg'd the Work of Fate, And heav'd huge Mountains at the burning Fleet; The burning Fleet deplore their impious Aim, And dread the Thund'rer, now they feel his Flame; With Shame, with Anguish, and with Guilt, expire, Or sink in watry Floods, or Floods of Fire. Calm o'er the Waves great Drake triumphant rode, Safe in the sacred Sanction of a God; His Ark, like Noah's, saw the whelming Tide, Absorp an impious World, and gorge its Pride, Conquest sat smiling at the Scene Heaven wrought, And, like the Dove, the peaceful Olive brought: Like Israel, England, on her Sea-beat Shore, Beheld the proud Egyptians, proud no more. But, as when once, the rebel Titans strove, And fell sad Victims to a vengeful Jove; Sprung from the Poison of their Hydra Gore, A Race arose, as impious as before; A Race, that durst usurp the bless'd Abodes, Defy the Thund'rer, and dethrone the Gods: So, from this base Defeat, with impious Rage, New Titans dar'd our British Gods engage; Salmoneus like, with mimick Power they strove, And madly arm'd the Thunder 'gainst its Jove. In the deep Bosom of the cavern'd Earth, Close plotting Treason laid the nitrous Birth; Old Midwife-Night with dusky Pinions sate, To hatch the Seeds, and brood them into Fate: When Britain's Genius from his ruling Star, Beheld the latent Ruin from afar; (Such, once in Heaven, he saw black Treasons Rage, When rebel Angels durst their God engage) With sailing Wings the sacred Pow'r descends, And hov'ring o'er his Isle incumbent bends; With tutelary Care, the Guardian sate, And anxious, watch'd the Birth of future Fate. And now the gloomy Wings of sable Night, Embrown'd the silver Empire of the Night; Nor yet the choral Cock proclaim'd the Day, But all in Silence, all in Horror lay; No breathing Breeze the dreery Forest shakes, And Heaven alone with watchful Treason wakes: Repos'd, the meditated Martyr lay, Nor slumb'ring dream'd himself a future Prey: Well might he rest secure from mortal Fear, Whose Happiness was Heaven's peculiar Care! Lo! thro' the Gloom, a darting Lustre streams, And, like a Comet, sheds its baleful Beams; Like that, each baleful Beam malignant Springs, Denouncing Fate to Empires, and to Kings: For lo! black Treason lifts her Hydra Head, Struck at her Monster-Form, she starts afraid, Shrinks in the deepest Gloom, and seeks the darkest Shade! But, ah! she turns—“O Britain see thy Doom— “Awake! arise! 'tis Hell conspires! 'tis Rome! Thanks Heaven! thy Beams dispel the hideous Sprite, She flies, she sinks, she seeks th' Abyss of the Night. Sink Fury! to the deepest Hell of Pains, There, curse thy Rage, in adamantine Chains! But, hark! Britannia's rousing Lion roars, And thunders Treason thro' her concave Shores; But Heaven protects—ye Echoes! waft it round, Ye repercussive Rocks! repeat the Sound. Hence learn, O treach'rous Rome! repuls'd retire, And only with Britannia's Peace, conspire; Oft as thy Plots, and Stratagems engage, As often shalt thou mourn thy baffled Rage; For know, we dare thy poor intending Hate, Whilst Walpole stands the Bulwark of our State: Whilst his judicious Hands our Vessel guide, Boldly we'll stem Old Time's tempestuous Tide; Led by that Star, the Storms of Fate defy, And launch into immense Eternity. Tho' Rocks, and Seas begird Britannia's Isle, Her happy Shades with Sweets eternal smile, Tho' the Winds rage, and the rough Billows roar, Soft-Halcyon Ease adorns Her peaceful Shore; Compos'd, she sees the factious Floods engage, And smiles Superiour to their empty Rage; The breaking Waves her Rocks with Fury beat, And mourn, like thee, O Rome! in Tears their base Defeat. 1725. THE EXCHANGE. I While Careful scolds his Daughter Molly, And tells Her, she's undone, By lying with her Lover Jolly, Their Neighbour's eldest Son. II My Maidenhead's gone indeed, (cries Miss) Yet, what care I a Farthing— I give Him it—but, then got His, And Pleasure into th' Bargain. ON CRASSUS. Don Crassus plum'd with Bacularian Pride, A Cap, a Gown, and eke a Robe beside; Pedantically saunters up and down, To satisfy the misbelieving Town, Proud of Himself—but prouder of his Gown. And well he may so; for the dapper Fellow Is but poor Fustian, tho' his Gown's Prunello! THE ROVER Fixed. Damon, whom all the World, but I believ'd The falsest Wretch that ever Nymph deceiv'd, According to the Promise of my Mind, The truest, and the faithfull'st Youth I find; Thro' ev'ry little Vice I trac'd the Swain, But still found Honour in his Bosom reign: So Proteus, if a Chain but held him fast, Shook off the Beast, and prov'd a God at last. THE Shooting Match: TO CUPID. Come, little God of Love, for once, let's try Who is the better Mark's-man, You, or I: So—fill your Quiver, summon all your Art, Well now the Bust? the bright Corinna's Heart, There, Sir, you've miss'd, and I have pierc'd the Part. I own I miss'd! but 'twas thro' want of Sight, To guide my never-erring Arrow right; But—lest you should conceive that I design'd, To take Advantage o'er you, 'cause you're Blind; We'll have another Tryal in the Dark, And let him take the Maid, who hits the Mark. CHLOE Reproved. As Chloe, conscious of her pretty Face, Kiss'd the reflected Goddess in the Glass; And shall these Charms, she cries, these matchless Charms, To Night be buried in an Husband's Arms? No!—since the Gods indulgent give me Power, I'll reign, at least, the Tyrant of an Hour! She said, and to the glitt'ring Toilet flew, Heighten'd each Charm, and e'en Diviner grew; A thousand Arts, a thousand Airs she tries, And thus computes the Conquests of her Eyes. With Scorn, Honorio's Passion I resign, Brillantis, dear Brillantis! shall be mine; Conquer'd Sireno shall these Charms adore, Sylvander, and an endless Thousand more. Thus spoke the proud pre-meditated Bride, And the Cosmetick Oracle reply'd. Beware, fair Maid, beware, nor strive to prove, The dangerous Varieties of Love; But think, how brittle are those Charms you boast, And think, how soon that Beauty may be lost. For this (take Notice what I say) Depend on, to your Sorrow, That if you change your Mind to Day, I'll change your Face to Morrow. THE Nightingale and Shepherd, Imitated from Strada. 'Twas when the Sun diffus'd a milder Ray, And length'ning Shades confess'd the shortning Day: To Tyber's Banks repair'd an am'rous Swain, The Love, and Envy, of the neighb'ring Plain; To cool his Heat, he sought the breezy Grove, To cool his Heat, but more, the Heat of Love; To sooth his Cares, on a soft Lute he play'd, But the soft Lute reviv'd the lovely Maid: Conspiring Elms their Umbrage shed around, Wav'd with Applause, and listen'd to the Sound: When Philomela, gentle Bird of Love, Poor, pretty, harmless Syren of the Grove! Enchanted, heard the Shepherd as he play'd, And stole attentive to the tuneful Shade, Perch'd o'er his Head, the Charmer seem'd to grow, And to the Lyre, in Shadows danc'd below; With scornful Eye elate, inclin'd to hear, And lent her Soul to listen in her Ear; As his swift Fingers tremble o'er the Lute, Softly she sings responsive to the Note; Each Air, each flowing Accent of the Song, She soothes, and sweetens, with her softer Tongue; Gently refines each imitated Strain And with his Musick charms the ravish'd Swain: The ravish'd Swain admir'd the just Replies, At first mistaken for the echoing Breeze; But when he found his little Rival near Imbibing Musick both at Eye and Ear; Sublimer Notes improv'd each lab'ring Air, The daring Prelude to the tuneful War: O'erjoy'd, the Charmer heard the bold defy, And warbling, answer'd, with a brisk Reply. Now tend'rest Thoughts the gentle Swain inspire, And with a dying Softness tune the Lyre, Echoe the Musick of the vernal Woods, Warble the Murmurs of the falling Floods. Thus sweet he plays, but sweet he plays in vain, For Philomela sings a sweeter Strain; With easier Art she modulates each Note, More nat'ral Musick melting in her Throat. Much he admir'd the Magick of her Tongue, But more to see his Lute, and Art out-done; And now, to loftier Airs, he tunes the Strings, And now, to loftier Airs, his Echoe sings; Tho' loud as Thunder, tho' as swift as Thought, She reach'd the swelling, caught the flying Note; In trembling Treble now in deeper Base, She show'd how Nature could his Art surpass. Amaz'd, at length, with Rage the Shepherd burn'd, His Admiration into Anger turn'd; Enflam'd with emulating Pride, he stood, And thus defy'd the Charmer of the Wood. And wilt thou still my Musick imitate? Then see thy Folly, and thy Task is great— For know more pow'rful Lays remain unsung, Lays! far superiour to that mimick Tongue— If not, this Lute, this vanquish'd Lute, I swear, Shall never more delight the ravish'd Ear; But, broke in scatter'd Fragments strew the Plain, And mourn the Glory, which it could not gain— He said, and as he said, his Soul on Fire, With a disdainful Air, he swept the Lyre; Quick to the Touch, the Tides of Musick flow; Swell into Strength, or melt away in Woe; Now, raise the shrilling Trumpets clanging Jar, Now, rouze the raging Thunders of the War; Now, soft'ning Sounds, and sadly-pleasing Strains, Breathe out the Lover's Joys, and Lover's Pains. He sung, and ceas'd his Rival's Notes to hear, As his dy'd list'ning in the ambient Air. But now, too late! her noble Folly found, Sad Philomela stood subdu'd by Sound. Tho' vanquish'd, yet, with gen'rous Ardour fill'd, Ignobly still she scorn'd to quit the Field; Each emulated Air, each labour'd Note, Trills on her Tongue, and trembles thro' her Throat, But slowly faint her pensive Accents flow, Weaken'd with Grief, and over-charg'd with Woe: Again, she tunes her Voice, again she sings, Strains every Nerve, and quivers on her Wings; In vain! her sinking Spirits fade away, And in a tuneful Agony decay; Dying, she fell, and as the Strains expire, Breath'd out her Soul in Anguish on the Lyre; Dissolv'd in Transport, there, resign'd her Breath, And gain'd a living Conquest by her Death. THE Court of VENUS, From CLAUDIAN. Where the fair Paphian Goddess kept her Court, Where the Loves wanton, and the Graces sport; A tow'ring Mountain lifts its lofty Brow, And bends with Pleasure o'er the Plains below; O'er distant, blue-retiring Hills surveys Its Shadows floating in Ionian Seas; The Top impervious, all Access denies, Tires the faint Foot, and dims the dizzy Eyes: No fierce, inclement Winter shivers here, No blasting Seasons nip the blooming Year, No smoaking Mists, nor foggy Damps arise, Hang o'er the Hills, or sail along the Skies; But an untainted Æther shines serene, And sheds its Influence on the smiling Scene; Eternal Sweets the wafting Breezes bring, And whisper out an everlasting Spring. This pleasurable Mountain by Degrees, Sinks in a Level, to salute your Eyes; Where Joy, succeeding Joy, for ever new, For ever rising to the ravish'd View, The wand'ring Sight with sweet Amusement leads Thro' golden Groves, and ever-living Meads. These were the Gifts, his Gratitude to prove, Vulcan bestow'd upon the Queen of Love; For these, the Queen of Love, resign'd her Charms, And over-sold the Heaven in her Arms. Here, a soft Grove its cooly Shade affords, Fann'd by the Musick of the warbling Birds; To this, the Sylvan Choristers resort, Hop on the Boughs, and to the Breezes sport: The Queen of Love, amid the tuneful Throng, With gracious Smiles rewards the fav'rite Song; Elects the worthy Tenant of the Grove, And dedicates him to the God of Love. Embow'ring Trees the mingled Shade compose, That imitates the Fair, for whom it grows; With complicating Poplars, Poplars twine, With spreading Alders, spreading Alders join: Majestick Elms with bending Foliage flow, Float in green Waves, and fan the Shades below; The Shades below, the cooling Gale receive, And rising, with the cooling Gale, revive: Two diff'rent Rivers murmur thro' the Grove, Two fatal Contrarieties in Love! This, sweet as mutual Joy in youthful Veins, That, bitter, as a dying Lover's Pains: Conscious, the Streams, each other seem to shun, But, in Meanders lost, too soon are One! Dipt in these fabled Waves, Love's fatal Dart, Stings the distracted Soul, to sooth the Heart; To these, their double Pow'r his Arrows owe, Soft-pleasing Joys, and sad consuming Woe. Rang'd on the Banks, the little Loves resort, Plight fancy'd Oaths, and bend their Bows in sport; These, tender Nymphs produc'd, a blooming Race! And left their Virgin Image on their Face. Their ruddy Cheeks their Parents Charms proclaim, Alike their Habit, and their Look the same: O'er all these Troops, presides the God of Love, A God, whom all the Gods revere above; Sprung from the Mother, and the Queen of Charms, He shines distinguish'd in superior Arms; His cogent Power e'en Deities controuls, And awes the Thunderer, that awes the Poles; On Earth, he triumphs o'er a Monarch's Cares, And blasts the Laurel, which the Thunder spares: In Woods, and Groves, th'inferiour Archers reign, Contented with the Conquests of the Plain. Close by the Streams, in fatal Pomp array'd, Love's wild romantick Equipage is laid: Here lawless Liberty for ever roves, For ever Riots in Excess of Loves; Inflam'd with Wine, distracted Rage appears, But soon dissolves in self-accusing Tears. Here warming Whispers propagate Replies, Sweet-melting Murmurs, soft-consenting Sighs; With all the Eloquence that Hearts confess, With all the Harmony that Eyes express: There young Desires their tasted Joys pursue, Pleas'd with the past, and panting for the new; When strange Chimeras on a sudden rise, Shift the false Scene, and intercept their Eyes; Tormenting Jealousies, uneasy Cares, Dissembling Hopes, imaginary Fears; Accusing Crimes of ill-requited Love, And breaking Vows re-echo thro' the Grove. Full in the midst, with nice-becoming Grace, Stood Youth, too conscious of his comely Face; Proud of his nervous Strength, and vig'rous Veins, With Pain, his Blood the luscious Tide contains; With haughty Smiles he mocks declining Age, His starv'd Enjoyments, and dissembled Rage; The wither'd Crone avoids him with Remorse, And sickens at the Thought of, Once he was— Proud o'er the Groves a glitt'ring Dome ascends, Rich with the Labour of Vulcanian Hands; Thro' the green Ranks, the darting Lustre streams, And the Shades kindle with reflected Flames; This Master-Piece of Skill, the Lemnian God, On his fair Spouse, a worthy Gift, bestow'd. Immortal Monuments of Art support The vast Foundations of each ample Court, On Diamond Pillars, Diamond Pillars rise At once invade, and emulate the Skies; Pelucid Crystal clarifies each Stone, And by excluding, makes a double Sun; In Oval Steps the wavy Topaz roll'd, Gleams by Reflexion on the valving Gold; Each Stone conspires its emulating Rays, Glitter the Beryls, and the Rubies blaze; Carv'd Saphirs melt in undulating Flame, And drink the lucid Amber's fainter Stream. Here spacious Greens, reviving Areas rise, And with a milder Scene refresh the Eyes; Thro' Cassia Groves ambrosial Breezes breathe, And steal the aromatick Sweets beneath; There, soft, inferiour Shades of Myrtle grow, And Lillies, blushing as the Roses glow; Dissolv'd with Joy, the trickling Balm runs o'er, And the sweet Tears distil at every Pore. But now, his Journey past, the God of Love, With joyful Steps approach'd his native Grove; And now he re-assumes a solemn Pace, He moves with Majesty, and looks with Grace. It happen'd then, with future Joys elate, His Goddess-Mother at her Toilet sate; On either Side, th' Idalian Sisters stand, Proud of the smiling Goddesses command; These scatter Odours o'er the fragrant Fair, Those thread the mazy Tendrils of her Hair; Part exercise the nice correcting Comb, Smooth the soft Curles, and call the Straglers home, The comely Fav'rites, by a nice Design, They leave to sport, and wanton with the Wind, The comely Fav'rites, with adorning Grace Wave on the Breeze, and flow upon her Face, With cooling Airs create an easy Pride, And, but increase the Charms, they strive to hide: No Glasses here, deluding Lights supply, The brilliant Diamond, guides the judging Eye; For as the Goddess moves new Mirrours rise, And catch augmenting Splendors from her Eyes; As to the multiplying Stones she turns, In all she dances, and in all she burns. But, Lo! a sudden Scene of Glory fires Her rising Soul, and breathes more gay Desires; Her Son's reflected Image she surveys, With trembling Joys, she turns to prove the Rays; But turning, conscious of her only Son, Into the bloomy Boy's Embraces run, Receives him panting at unfolding Charms, And hugs the little Darling in her Arms. Orpheus and Eurydice, From Virgil's Fourth Georgick. Incens'd, the raging Prophet thus replies, Gnashes his Teeth, and rolls his azure Eyes. No common Vengeance does your Crimes pursue, Your Crimes, which well deserve their fatal due: But humbly supplicate immortal Hate, And wisely shun the threat'ning Rage of Fate; O! think on Orpheus, and his injur'd Spouse, And mark the wicked Author of their Woes; When lawless Lust enflam'd thy boiling Blood, To chace the flying Fair along the Flood: Think, how the Snake, in verdant Ambush laid, Unwarily surpriz'd the panting Maid; Shrieking, she fell, resign'd her fainter Breath, And sought the kinder Arms of icy Death: The Nymphs, the Swains, the dying Virgin mourn'd The River Deities, the Grief return'd; The Winds, with sympathizing Sorrow, sigh'd, And the sad Streams their trickling Tears supply'd. The wretched Husband, hopeless of Relief, In tuneful Anguish sought to sooth his Grief; But rising Sorrows all his Thoughts controul, Flow in his Eyes, and melt his soft'ning Soul; In plaintive Strains he mourns his Consort gone, Sighs to the rising, and the setting Sun; Till wildly lost in Solitude, and Woe, Raving, he sought, the dreary Shades below, Advent'rous by Despair, and dar'd to tread The melancholly Mansions of the Dead; With Songs to supplicate th' infernal Power, And sooth the God, who ne'er was sooth'd before. Lur'd by the Magick of the sacred Sound, Swift-gliding Crouds of Spectres hover round; Thick, as when Fowls obscure the Ev'ning Air, And to their Groves in feather'd Clouds repair; Men, Matrons, Maids, a visionary Throng, Surround the Poet, and imbibe his Song; With all those Multitudes of empty Ghosts, Where Stygian Streams surround the squallid Coasts; Heedless their own unhappy Fates to mourn, Weeping, they make his Misery their own. E'en Hell it self, with all its Fiends, was charm'd, Its Terrors soften'd, and its Rage disarm'd; The grinning Guardian loll'd his triple Tongue, And fawning, lick'd the Poet, as he sung; The very Furies heav'd away their Chains, And sound their own too weak for Musick's Strains, Ixion his eternal Toil forewent, And list'ning, on his rolling Labour, leant. But now the tuneful Bard, his Bride restor'd, Back to the Realms of Day, the Path explor'd; Slowly she follow'd, as he led the Way, Obedient to Proserpina's Decree: For if, before the gloomy Shades were past, He turn'd to Look, the Look must be his last, A Fault which Hell might pass in Silence by, Could Hell behold it with a Lover's Eye: And now near travers'd o'er the Realms of Night, They rose emergent on the Beams of Light; When the poor Youth unfortunately kind, Cast a too fond-conductive Glance behind: But, as he turn'd, three Peals of Thunder spoke, The dire conditionary Promise broke; While thus the sadly sweet, reproving Maid, Bespoke the Youth by too much Love betray'd. Unhappy Orpheus! ah, unhappy Boy! What mov'd thee thus to blast our bloomy Joy? Alas! for ever lost, I leave Thee now! This parting Kiss, to sooth eternal Woe— Farewel—dim Shades of Horrour round me rise, And sudden Night o'erwhelms my swimming Eyes. She said; and as she said, in Shades withdrew, From his deluded Arms, the Vision flew; With strict Embrace, in vain he stops her Stay, Desolv'd to air, unfelt, she glides away; In vain he seeks her with incessant Eyes, In vain invokes her with imploring Cries; What could he do? All Efforts are too late, Again her Soul is summon'd down by Fate; Th' infernal Ferry-man relents no more, And e'en his Musick now forgets its Power! Seven Months, by Fame's Report, the lonesome Swain, Devoted to his melancholly Pain: Where Scythian Hills are bleak with drifted Snow, And shiver in the frigid Floods below, Distracted, with Indulgency of Grief, In Soul-restoring Strains he sought Relief; In Strains that e'en the barren Mountains charm'd, And their eternal Frosts with Pity warm'd: The list'ning Salvages his Power confess'd, Their Rage he sooth'd, but could not sooth his Breast. As the lamenting Nightingale complains, Of cruel Spoilers, and destructive Swains, When sad! she sees her Younglings borne away, Her downy Darlings, an inhuman Prey! Sunk in some Gloom, she darkling Pines alone, Sighs out her Grief, and murmurs out her Moan. Thus Orpheus sought to calm his peaceless Breast, A Stranger to the Quietude of Rest; Now wildly tortur'd by Despair, he goes, O'er freezing Mountains of eternal Snows, Delighted to the barren Rocks to tell, The rigorous Benevolence of Hell; Averse to Venus, and the Nuptial Joys, In unavailing Grief his Life destroys; Till frantick Bacchanals that madly strove To warm his Bosom to a second Love, With Rage, Revenge, and brutal Fury arm'd, More Salvage, than those Salvages he charm'd, Conspir'd against his Life, the Bard they slew, And on cold Hebe's Streams his Head they threw; Yet, e'en in Death, his Voice bewails his Woe, And with the Streams his Strains in Anguish flow; Eurydice! his dying Tongue deplores, Eurydice! resounds along the length'ning Shores. Upon a NEEDLE: Occasioned by seeing a Lady Embroidering. Ths little Instrument of Art, Methinks, resembles Cupid's Dart; As the silken Wound it gives, With enliv'ning Beauty lives; So the pointed Shafts of Love, On my Heart, their Power prove; And, as the vital Threads they pierce, Animate a Spring of Verse, Whilst the Flowers of Poetry Arise, these brighter Flowers to see. Yet, tho' thus like, both Darts appear, In the main Point, they differ far; For, but consider, their Employs— This Creates, but that Destroys! TO Mr. Taylor, A. B. of St. John's, &amp;c. Upon Reading some of his excellent Poems. As Suppliants e'er they seek the sacred Shrine, Prefer their Off'rings to the Power within; Thus let me fix this Token of my Zeal, Here, thro' these Gates of Fame, a Pass-port steal; Pursue the Paths of Glory where you run, And, like the Lark, salute the rising Sun. But hark! what sweet enchanting Notes I hear! Does Horace, or does Taylor charm mine Ear? Delusive Thought! the Roman, now no more, To Latium lost, delights th' Elysium Shore; There, hap'ly could he hear thy loftier Strain, Thy Lyre would charm him into Life again. Securely may'st thou dare the Darts of Death, Defy the Tyrant with thy latest Breath; For this Life lost, eternal Life receive, And in thy own Pindaric ever live. What may not all thy lofty Numbers raise, When Light receives new Lustre from thy Lays? Amaz'd, I view'd thy Beams, like antient Night, Silver my Gloom, and chear my Soul with Light: Like the fair Orb you sing with equal Force, By your own Brightness you direct your Course; To us below, thy genial Rays dispense, The glorious Beams of everlasting Sense; Ripen each Thought, recal each Fancy forth, And warm Poetic Harvests into Birth. In thee, as in Apollo, both unite, Celestial Lustre, and celestial Wit. Had Holy David heard thee weep his Woe, The Psalmist had resign'd his Harp to you; Music, like yours, would all his Griefs controul, And sooth him, as he sooth'd distemper'd Saul. But whilst I thus thy pleasing Paths pursue, What Fields of Glory open to my View? What rising Raptures, all my Breast inspire, How my Soul kindles with reflected Fire! Still, as I read, with Rage divine I glow, Dwell on each Thought, and strive to think like you: With Wonder view judicious Ardour shine, Bloom in each Thought, and ripen ev'ry Line: Each manly Verse, with female Sweetness flows, With Fruits, and Blossoms, like the Orange glows. But, O! forgive a weak officious Friend, And let these Lines my honest Love commend: Whilst to sublimer Flights your Wings aspire, Thus let me gaze at Distance, thus admire; Receive a single Portion of your Power, Nor, like Elisha, could I wish for more. But, when Time sees thy future Laurels grow For some Great Iliad, to adorn thy Brow, In the soft Shade, thus let me chaunt my Love, And live the Linnet of thy Laurel-Grove. To LAURA. When Paris saw the bright Celestial Three, And view'd those Beauties, now reviv'd in Thee, Hadst thou, my Laura, seen the grand Dispute, Hadst thou contended for the glitt'ring Fruit; Heaven's Queen had found her princely Presents vain, Nor proffer'd Empires you alone could gain; Pallas abash'd, had own'd with sweet Surprize, The silent Eloquence of magic Eyes: Such Eyes had smil'd Thee fairest of the Fair. And Venus own'd a brighter Venus there. Tho' Venus shone with each alluring Grace, Her Charms had only gain'd a second Place: Thine! Thine had won the Shepherd's noble Part, Tho' Hers the Apple, Thine had been his Heart. To the Same, Weeping. If Laura weep for those her Eyes have slain, Then Smile, my Fair, and we'll revive again. To the SAME. ON HER PATCHES. Laura, you say, these sable Spots impart, The seemly Tokens of each Love-burnt Heart; As conquer'd Trophies grace some sacred Shrine, So they adorn a Power, as much Divine: But if, among those Conquests of your Eyes, My humble Heart can prove a worthy Prize; O let your Lip the faithful Token wear, And let me live on endless Kisses there! TO Her RING. Blest Ornament! how happy is thy Snare, To bind the snowy Finger of my Fair! O could I learn thy nice-coercive Art, And as thou bind'st her Finger, bind her Heart! Not Eastern Diadems, like Thee, can shine, Fed from her brighter Eyes with Beams Divine; Nor can their mightiest Monarch's Pow'r command So large an Empire, as Thy Charmer's Hand. O could thy Form Thy fond Admirer wear, Thy very Likeness should in all appear; My endless Love, Thy endless Round should show, And my Heart flaming, for Thy Diamond glow. ON A Lady's Necklace. Ye Crystal Orbs that on her Bosom lie, The glitt'ring Planets of a brighter Sky, Like Stars illumin'd by the Lamp of Day, From my Selinda's Eye you catch your Ray; Well may those Eyes of Light like yours inspire, When their least Beam can set my Heart on Fire. O happy Chain! thy artless Foldings prove Superior to the magic Charms of Love! O! were you, by a just Possession, mine, And had I Power to make you more Divine; Could Art increase each Globe, as large as This, Like Anthony, I'd give it for a Kiss: My Worlds, tho' swell'd to Thousands, I'd bestow, To circle my Selinda's Neck, like You. TO A LADY, Who is most Beautiful, when Angry. Cælia, methinks, that sweet contracted Brow, Resembles angry Cupid's bended Bow; Like, That, it aims a Stroke at every Heart, Whilst either Eye supplies a keener Dart. On WOMEN. Bright, as those glittering Worlds that roll above, Are Women, when in Virtue's Orb they move; But then, like Stars, once fall'n, their Light they lose, Unheeded fade, and turn to Slime, like those. TO Mrs. WIGMORE, Upon seeing Her at the Mountebank's Stage. Could Smith's Medicinary Power but heal, With half that Ease, your fatal Glances kill: How might we bless the Love-relieving Art! How might it sooth this sad afflicted Heart! But yet, for O! so pleasing is the Flame, So like the charming Fair, from whom it came! First, let each Pang distract my peaceful Rest. But never, never! leave my Love-sick Breast; Still, still, let Hope indulge the dear Desire, And with the Lamp of Life alone expire; So shall my Death, my faithful Passion prove, And my Heart die a Martyr to my Love. TO Mr. EUSDEN, Desiring his Corrections on a Poem. Dear SIR, If what a grateful Heart can give, May meet a kind Reception, This receive; To these low, humble Lines, a while unbend, And let the Critic soften to the Friend; Let human Candor aid thy judging Art, And thy Head ever dictate from thy Heart! Fond to be thought a Candidate for Fame, My Muse, Ambitious, takes a lofty Aim; But, ah! too bold her Wish, too large her View, Unless approv'd, unless inspir'd by you; Unless you tune her Notes, in vain she sings, Unless you Aid, in vain she spreads her Wings; Aw'd by your Word, she'll, blushing own her Fault, Disclaiming each Extravagance of Thought; Nature, and Art, at once, like you, dispence, And ripen Fancy into Strength of Sense. Thus, tender Trees, with Flowers luxuriant Smile, Waste their vain Sap, ungrateful to their Soil; Till some wise Hand, with kind corrective Care, Prune their gay Pride, and bid their Branches bear: Then Fruits, and Flowers, promiscuously abound, Teem from the Stroke, and Blossom from the Wound. Sidney College, Jan. 27. 1725–6. W. Pattison. AN Apology to Mr. Bell. Clarior in Tenebris si latuisset, erat. SIR, If I my Tributary Lays refuse, O blame not me, but blame the conscious Muse! For when commanding Duty bids me sing, She stops my Voice, and breaks the jarring String; And when I would the pleasing Task renew, The awful Roman rises to my view, Let those, says he, who aim in all they write, At once to mingle Profit, and Delight; Their Theme exactly to their Measures fit, Nor vainly hope to rise above their Wit: Who looks aloft, will surely tread awry, And may mistake a Marl-pit for the Sky. Yet, like the rest, I can my Tribute bring, Like some perhaps in spite of Nature sing: Ransack each common Author, and from thence Profane good antient Phrase with modern Sense. In Rapine rich, laboriously dull, Witty, but just enough to show a Fool; How could I languish in a rural Song, And tag the Tadpole-Pastoral along? How sweetly should the tuneful Murmurs creep, And lull the ravish'd Reader fast a-sleep? The blasted Oaks should then more justly fear, My Rhyming Fury, than the Thunder's Scar. How could I, wing'd with Splay-foot Lyrics fly, Like Hag, on Broomstick, thro' the troubled Sky! Rhyming, I'd mount, like Dennis, heretofore, Bluster, as loudly, and as proudly soar. Well may such Poets rise a tow'ring Height, Who have no Thought to intercept their Flight; Nor need they Fear to tumble from the Skies, For those can never Fall, who never Rise. But shall I with collected Theft prophane, The great, the bless'd, the venerable Name! Shall I with Murd'rers to the Altar flie, Not thro' religious Zeal, but Infamy, As Blackmore sought in Job a Sanctuary! Forbid it, Heav'n—I chuse an humbler Fate, Nor would be wicked, to be vainly Great. Let me in lowlier Scenes a while delight, With cooling Judgment meditate the Flight; Then, worthy Sir, if Time confirm my Thought, The Tribute, if 'tis worthy, shall be brought; With double Ardour I'll the Task pursue, To sing of Heaven, and to sing to You. To Mr. HEDGES, On Reading his Latin Ode to Dr. Broxholme. Unskill'd in Greek, and Roman Tongue, Which Words are short, and which are long, To Thee, these home-spun Lines I send, Not as a Scholar, but a Friend. Here I might shew, from wise Example, In Work elaborate and ample, That Homer, tho' he writ in Greek, Writ what his Mother taught him speak; Horace and Virgil's learned Latin, Was what, when Boys, they us'd to prate in. That all fam'd Bards, except the Dutch, (If there were ever any such) Have writ the Poems, they excel in, In the same Tongue they learn'd to spell in. To Thee alone, with greatest Ease, 'Tis granted, in all Ways, to please; And, by a Gift from Heaven miraculous, All Lingua's are to thee Vernacula's: That Horace self had scarcely known, Thy Thoughts, or Language from his own. Many a Lad returns from School, A Latin, Greek, and Hebrew Fool; In Arts and Knowledge still a Block, Tho' deeply skill'd in Hic, Hæc, Hoc. Heavy they tread the up-hill Way, O'er craggy Rocks, and found'ring Clay, Till weary with their Road, they stop Just at the Mountain's lofty Top; Still poring on the barren Ground, View not the beauteous Prospect round; Which, hid beneath the Summit, lies Conceal'd from low, and vulgar Eyes, And which alone can amply Pay The Toil and Drudgery of the Way: From hence, they might, with Transport view All that the antient Sages knew; What they perform'd, and what they Thought, How Tully spoke, and Cæsar fought; What Manners of a World unknown Should guide their Youth, and form their own; What bright Examples lead to Fame, And Vicious teach to fly their Shame. Yet we might spare the mighty Pains In searching ancient dark Remains; Since greater Worthies rise at Home, And Britain scorns to yield to Rome. Augustus' Reign, renown'd for Peace, For Learning, Wit, and Wealth's Increase; No more we Envy, while our Land Is doubly bless'd from George's Hand. Ammon's Success, and Cæsar's Mind, To form victorious Marlbro', join'd; Demosthenes', and Tully's Fame, Must yield to Walpole's greater Name; Faction, and Strife, to hear his Voice, Are dumb, and cease their jarring Noise: Whole Senates bow their yielding Minds, Like Woods before the Southern Winds; Free from Deceit, and servile Art, He speaks the Dictates of his Heart; His Tongue enchants, his Counsel leads; Peace enters first, then Wealth succeeds: His Virtues thro' the Land confess'd, While thus he soothes us to be blest. If to new Scenes we turn our View, And Learning, Arts, and Wit pursue, Our Land can furnish Men of Fame, To eclipse the Greek, and Roman Name. Locke shall instruct, and form our Youth, And teach their Understandings Truth. Vice shall look pale, and Virtue thrive, Humanity, and Friendship live; While Addison our Morals rules, And proves all Villains to be Fools. Newton shall lead our ravish'd Souls, Thro' boundless Worlds beyond the Poles; From Star to Star direct our Way, As certain, and as fix'd as they. Examples were but vain to prove, Our Nation's boast, our Country's Love. A Land of Patriots brave, and free, While all Mankind are Slaves but We! To what a Height true Wit can reach, Let Waller, and let Congreve teach; And if we needs must write by Rules, Without th' Assistance of the Schools, In flowing Verse, and Lines well-wrought, What Horace, what Quintilian thought, Join'd with a little Mother Wit, Roscommon, and our Pope have writ. The Fair, who best the Muse inspire, Who warm the Heart, and tune the Lyre, Superiour to all former Dames, Inhabit now the Banks of Thames: Th' Egyptian Queen, the Ancient's boast, For whom the well-fought World was lost, Tell me, dear Hedges, thou canst tell, Thou know'st the Dead, and Living well, Could she her haughty Charms compare With her, who represents her here? Old Homer's Theme, the Grecian Dame, Who set whole Nations in a Flame, No more had been the beauteous Prize, Had they beheld Lavinia's Eyes: The Greeks for her alone had strove, And Paris had been false to Love. Thus taught, and thus inspir'd, I write What Friendship, and what Love indite; Free from each Modern Witling's Vice, Envy, and Slander, Flattery, Lies, To please our Pride, or gain our End, Each Jest should sacrifice a Friend; While One's Ill-nature joins to praise, What t' other's Malice dully says; In Peace my harmless Minutes pass, 'Twixt Business, Beauty, and a Glass; Nor Want I aught, my Soul to cheer, But thee, to join in Pleasure here; Thus may I live, till Life shall end, And love my Mistress, Country, Friend! SONG. I Here's to Thee, my Damon, let's drink, and be merry, And drown all our Cares in full Bumpers of Sherry; Commit e'ry Care to the Guardians above, And we'll live like Immortals in Pleasure and Love. II Here's Phillis's Health, Lo! the Liquor flows higher, 'Tis Phillis's Name that awakens its Fire; Since the Liquor is clear, let our Eloquence shine, And Fancy be brisk, as the sparkling Wine: III Ye Nymphs, and ye Graces, ye Cupids, ye Swains, Go pluck the sweet Roses, the Pride of the Plains; Pluck only such Roses, as worthy the Fair, And weave her a Chaplet, with diligent Care: IV While to yon cool Poplar's kind Shade we retire, To melt in Embraces, and mingle our Fire; In languishing Blisses, we'll live, and we'll die, She'll melt in the Flames, that I catch at her Eye. TO A FRIEND, Dissuading him from loving a certain Lady. If aught a kindly Caution can impart, Be This, not Love, imprinted on thy Heart; Let every Line a well-known Truth commend, And, where you doubt the Poet, trust the Friend; Let vanquish'd Reason re-assume the Field, And to the True, the fictious Goddess yield. What Homer feigns, when fierce Tydides strove, Inspir'd by Pallas, with the Queen of Love; But shows the Weakness of vain Beauty's Art, Whilst Wisdom's sacred Influence arms the Heart: Yet, green in Age, unvers'd in Female Wiles, Each specious show our easy Sight beguiles; Gay-courting Scenes, the early Path adorn, And blooming Beauty paints our youthful Morn; Our heedless Pleasures, with false Objects, rise, Blind to the black'ning Cloud, and gathering Skies. But, ah! methinks, I hear thee, sighing, say, Such Charms invite! so flowery Smiles the Way! Resolv'd, fair Beauty's lovely Maze I'll run— Who might not thus? who would not be undone!— O stay, rash Youth! beware, be timely wise, Lurk'd in that Labyrinth, another Monster lies! How weak were Female Snares, how vain each Wile, Did not our Eyes our hood-wink'd Minds beguile? Like gross Idolaters, we form the Power, Then, the dull Image, as a God, adore; Breath'd in soft Sighs, our pleading Souls impart, And, for the Victim, Sacrifice our Heart: Hence, Cælia rules, the Tyrant of thy Breast, In all the seeming Deity confest; Hence, when she Speaks, there's Musick in the Sound, Hence, when she Looks, her Eyes like Lightenings wound: But, to thy Reason's Eye, the Scene display, And the proud Phantom-Goddess fades away; No more her Immortality remains, Unless preserv'd in thy immortal Strains. Grant we, thy Cælia's Charms superior shine, Or, in the Lover's Language, look Divine; Yet, is each Charm to her alone confin'd? Or canst Thou judge, by partial Passion blind? Still, will each faithful, Love-alluring Grace, Beam in her Eye, and brighten up her Face? So, the blue Summit of some Mountain's Height, Wrapt in gay Clouds, deludes the distant Sight; But, as with gazing Eyes, we draw more near, Fades the false Scene, and the rough Rocks appear. Nor outward Form thy easy Thought controul, But be the Look an Index to the Soul; For when old Nature fram'd the faithless Fair, From every Work, the Goddess cull'd a share; In heav'nly Beauty bad her Face excel, But made her Heart the Treasury of Hell: Hence, Pride, and Lust, and jealous Fury grow, The Springs of Sorrow, and the Seeds of Woe! Thus Brothels with a painted Angel shine, Whilst latent Devils en-ambush'd, lurk within. Nor think, my Damon, that I rashly blame, Thy too good Nature, thy too generous Flame; Like thine, my victim'd Heart, the Pangs has bore, But, (ah delightful Change!) endures no more; Yet O! for oft the Thought disturbs my Rest, 'Tis hard to heal a love-envenom'd Breast; So soft each Arrow steals upon our Heart, It glides a Feather, but it grows a Dart! Yet, wouldst thou from increasing Ills be free, Pursue my Precepts, and resolve like me, When the false Syren singles out her Man, Tips the lewd Leer, or flaps the flirting Fan; O shun th' Infection swift, victorious, fly, She smiles a Ruin, and she looks a Lie! But, must some lovely, some divinely Fair, Sweeten this Draught of Life, and sooth thy Care; Let the gay Muse relieve thy sickening Pain, And form a brighter Venus of the Brain; Then shalt thou scorn those Charms that made thee grieve, And, by the fair Illusion, learn to live. So Israel's Sons, by poisonous Serpents stung, Aloft in Air, a mimick Serpent hung; Fix'd on the Sight, the sad afflicted Train Gaz'd into Health, and look'd away their Pain. Sedney-Coll. Feb. 19. 1725–6. ON A Painted LADY. Cælia's fair, the charming Toast, May of each Perfection boast; What penurious Nature owes, Art more liberal bestows: Bids a fresher Blush arise, Keener Light'ning arm her Eyes; Adds, or animates a Grace, And wakes the Wonders of her Face: The blushing Tinctures smiling flow, To see how cunningly they grow; To see how all the Beaus adore Cælia, mortal now no more, New created by their Power. Thus the fairest sweetest Place, Once uncultivated was; Where Parterres their Flowers disclose, Bushes, Brakes, and Briars rose; Thorns with pointed Horror stood, And arm'd the Borders of the Wood; But since the Workman's pow'rful Hand Subdu'd, and civiliz'd the Land; Tun'd the Torrents to Cascades, And soften'd Forests into Shades, Surprizing Scenes attract our Sight, And turn Displeasure to Delight; The Savages forsake their Place, And yield to nobler Human-Race. The COMET. To a Divine, On his saying, He had seen every Thing but a Comet. Great has your Pleasure, Doctor, been, You Nature's choicest Works have seen, All, but a Comet—and Would Nature by her dread Command, One of her long-tail'd Children bring, You might say, you've seen every Thing. If so—you must have, Doctor, seen, All Sarah hides in quilted Green; I long to know how it appear'd,— A Comet has a flaming Beard. 'Tis Comet-like, if I guess right, At once 'twill entertain and fright; 'Tis Comet-like, agreed by all, And seldom seen, but Great Men fall. An Natura intendat Monstrum? Neg. Translated from the Carm. Quad. Press'd with a Load of Poverty, and Years, How strange a Prodigy the Wretch appears; Whose trembling Limbs, and furrow'd Brows reveal, The noxious Witch, Foe to the publick Weal; Who gathers Herbs by Moon-Light, and alarms The neighb'ring Villages with magick Charms: To her imagin'd Spells dire Woes succeed, The gen'rous Courser loaths the flow'ry Mead; Spurning the Glebe around the Field he flies, Forsakes his dappled Mares, repines, and dies. From Infants tender Throats (what Nurses say There Numbers shall to wond'ring Ears convey) Sharp Pins, and Needles, tear their bloody Way. From Heifers stubborn Teats the trickling Store Of milky Nectar now descends no more; Dame Baucis trudges to the Fields in vain, Few Drops, alas! her stinted Pails contain. Oft the malicious Hag is seen to flie, Thro' the large Convex of the nether Sky; Upborn by magick Staff she rides secure, (Superiour to the giddy Whirlwinds Power.) Advent'rous, o'er the pathless Welkin strays, Mocks the rude Winds, and in the Tempest plays. Now dwindled to an Hare, she scours in View, While the full Cry her circling Mare pursue; Now, tir'd, the Beagle's eager Speed eludes, In puzling Thickets lost, or trackless Woods: The baffled Hunters for the Witch enquire, Now safely seated by the Kitchin Fire; Hid in Grimalkin's Form, with sullen Pride, Demure she sits, and licks her Tabby side. Whence knows she thus to vary her Disguise, And in a borrow'd Shape deceive our Eyes? She, whom the restless Course of Time made old, (Time that distorts the fairest human Mould) Tho' a poor simple Soul as ever liv'd, Is by the Vulgar as a Witch receiv'd. Thus Monsters in our Mind alone exist, We give 'em Birth, and Shape them as we list. To Mr. ROCHE, Upon his Translating the foregoing Piece. To Praise unknown, unknowing to commend, Distinguishes the Critick from the Friend: Such was my just Applause when publick Fame Proclaim'd your Merit, but conceal'd your Name. Like Ægypt we Ador'd the teeming Flood, And bless'd the latent Author of our Good. No more shall silly Tales the World deceive, No more the sillier World those Tales believe; Each wither'd Crone shall live, and die unblam'd, And be no more a Witch, or Wizard nam'd: No publick Grievances infest her Ease, But innocently she may stink in Peace. The only Prodigy which now appears, Is such a Genius so beyond its Years. TO A Wretched Poetaster; That went into Mourning to counterfeit His Sister's Death. In vain, poor fustian Fop, you dress and write, Begot in Nature's Scorn, and Wit's Despite; For sure she made thee, only for a Rule, To form a Coxcomb, and a canting Fool: In vain you tag dull miserable Rhime, And make it with your shambling Legs to chime; The Muse you may pursue in Nature's spite, But never over-take her tow'ring Flight; In this you're only right, so smart in Black, For then, you show your Soul, upon your Back. As the sly Peasant hangs a breathless Crow, To scare the Vermin from the Corn below; So Fortune sets thee in a World of Wit, To keep Fools like thy self from tasting it. Of old, we read Amphion's sacred Song, Could draw dull Blocks, and senseless Stones along; The same Effect among thy Books we see, For they draw Blocks, as dull, in drawing Thee. Thy Wit, and Money, both are of a Length, Both stol'n, dependant on each other's Strength; But soon thy Sister shall resume her Breath, And to thy Muse, and Thee give surer Death; Then, those black Ensigns of her wish'd-for Fate, May mourn thy transient Wit, and lost Estate. Wrote at Appleby-School, 1723. SONG. I 'Twas in the solemn Noon of Night, As I lay by a murmuring Stream, Betray'd by Fancy's sweet Delight, Amus'd by an amorous Dream. II When strait I heard, or seem'd to hear, From an Ivy's dark reverend Shade, A solemn Sound assault mine Ear, And heavily pierce the thick Glade. III But soon a faint-pale Form appear'd, Like a Shade on a Moon-shiny Wall; To it's gor'd Breast it's Hand it rear'd, And utter'd this sorrowful Call. IV O pity me kind hearted Swain! For you knew, ah too well! the false Maid; She lov'd me first, first sooth'd my Pain, She sooth'd it, but then she betray'd! V Depress'd with Anguish, Rage, and Grief, I fatally sought out this Grove, Here rashly cut the Thread of Life, And ended all Hopes of my Love! VI But yet, tho' Beauty cannot please, And, tho' I'm now tasteless of Charms, 'Twill rob me of eternal Rest, To think her enjoy'd in thy Arms. VII Yet once, I think, thou wert my Friend, Till the Friend in the Rival was lost, O kindly let the Rival end, Nor farther torment a poor Ghost! VIII For this a restless Shade I rove— Be warn'd by my pitiful Fate! Betimes, betimes renounce your Love, Nor ponder this Lesson too late! IX So may good Angels guard thy sleep— But I to the false-hearted Maid Will glide, and thro' the Curtains peep; There shew Her the Man she betray'd. X She cannot, sure, she cannot see So wretched an Object unmov'd! At least, I think, she'll pity me, More truly, than ever she lov'd. XI Farewel—but, go to yonder Cave, Where my Bones to the Ravens lie bare; Inhume them kindly in a Grave, And my Fame from Aspersors, O clear! XII I trembled as the Spectre spoke, And starting, awak'd with the Fright, While the hoarse Night-Bird's hollow Croak, Presented the shivering Sprite. XIII A sudden Chillness freez'd my Breast, My Soul in a Terror was fled; Fainting, I sunk, benumb'd, oppress'd; And dreamt that Beliza was dead. XIV When soon, for now the dawning Light Be-jewell'd the dew-dropping Vale, A Youth came posting thro' the Night; To tell me the fore-boded Tale. XV The Maid was dead—my Fears were just I arose, and soon found out the Cave, Prepar'd an Urn, then mix'd their Dust, And weeping laid both in a Grave. FROM London to Cambridge. An Epistle to Mr. Roche. SIR, Yours, I receiv'd, with mighty Pleasure, Attended with my learned Treasure; And had I Burkett's Knack, and Time, I'd shoe my Muse's Feet with Rhime, I'd send you such a Pack of News, Nay, make an Hackney of my Muse: Prove Logically Pope a Fool, Sagely denounce great Shakespeare dull, To both prefer good Master Fenton, Or, in a Moment's Time invent One; But for Necessity you know, One's Self might stand—in Statu Quo. But hang it, I've no Turn for Satire, Besides, 'tis quite against my Nature; For Criticisms! pshaw the Bottle,— The Devil take your Aristotle: Give me a sparkling foaming Glass, As bright, and clever as my Lass; Thus let us dance an endless Round, Till one, or t'other throws me down. But now to talk a little serious, Nor vainly light, nor yet mysterious; Pray how do Cambridge-Matters stand? How fare the Brethren of the Band? For now I think on't in your last, Those things were negligently pass'd; But in your next, pray let me know, If you can come to Town, or no; For solitary here I stay, Impatient at your long Delay; Most indolently spend my Time, Or sleep, or drink, or idly Rhime; Now lay new Models for a Poem, Then in a Moment's Time undo 'em; For faith the tuneful Tribe neglect me, While you are absent to direct me. But, if you'll come, then in a Trice, Assisted by your good Advice; I'll polish my poetick Store, And fish for Trouts in Metaphor; To Thames' serene Retreats repair, And finish my Six Cantoes there; My pleasurable Labours done, Subscribe, your Servant Pattison. To the Same. While You, my dear, sit moap'd in College, And lose your Wit in search of Knowledge, Restrain'd by Tutors, aw'd by Doctors, And watch'd by supercilious Proctors; I make the present Day my own, And Dedicate it to the Town: As how? why thus; here's just a Piece And this is all, my Pleasure's Price; With this I'll get politely drunk, With this I'll get some courtly Punk, Not one of your damn'd common Whores, That ply it at your Merchant's Doors; But one, ay, such a one! so fine! You Bards would call her some Divine— Some—but a Rapture here encroaches, Time spends—you Captain of the Coaches! Here Master—where? why to the Rose, (A Place that every Body knows.) But now we've got a Moment's Talk, As Folks tell Stories as they walk; For once I'll be as dull and sober, As if I 'ad guzzled fat October. I know now You, and Twenty more, If once Poetically—Poor; Would sit and frown, be hip'd, and snivel, And curse your Fortune to the Devil; Whilst I, all Gay, and Debonair, Till, I must feel, would nothing fear. Riches are Joys indeed—I want 'em, And I'll thank Fortune if she'll grant 'em; If not—why I'm the richer still— No, no, you mean the poorer Will— The richer, Sir, I say again, And thus the Matter I'll explain. Those Mortals, happy, you'll allow, Who nothing Borrow, nothing Owe? But search the World; and if you can In Town, or Country, find that Man, To your Opinion I'll descend, If not, I hope, you'll hear your Friend. Well, for that's nearest, go to Court, Begin your Search, I wish you Sport: His Honour, Lordship, and His Grace, All mighty Men! in mighty Place! But how are all those Honour's gain'd? Those mighty Places, how obtain'd? How? why by Interest, and Favour, Then let me Note, Sir, by your Leave here; Those Dignities 'tis plainly shown, Are but Another's, not their Own; Soon got, they may as soon be lost, While Whim, and Fancy rule the Roast; And very plainly, by the bye, Belong as much to You, or I. But if they're bob'd by Church or State, You say they've got a great Estate: A great Estate! by whom? or how? Lord, Sir! your're too inquis'tive now— Job's Father's dead, he's eldest Son, Just come to Age, so All's his own; What would you more? but lend your Ear, And in a Moment you shall hear; Your 'Squire has Wealth, and therefore Parts! Is great at Court, deep vers'd in Arts: Yet whilst his Stock of Wealth and Sense, Is due to Men, or Providence, He lives!—but on another's Pence! And while he grows the richer, yet He only runs the more in Debt, Hence Logically I could show, The more we Have, the more we Owe; But Time's too precious thus to spend, And see we're at our Journey's End— Here, O delicious! take the Glass— O fill it higher! name the Lass— Now make a Fool, as Tale shall bless us, Of Aristotle, and of Crœsus. TO Mr. MITCHELL, Upon His Poetical Petition to the Honourable Sir Robert Walpole. Back Scribler, to thy Caledonian Plains, Cold as thy Genius, barren as thy Brains; To those inhospitable Mountains shew, A cursed Rhiming-Itch, they never knew; Nor think to read thy Lectures here, for know, We never take Dictators from the Plough: Then peaceably betimes resign thy Quill, Scotland, to British-Power, is Subject still; While Congreve with a just Politeness warms, While easy Pope with flowing Musick charms; While witty Swift shall every Muse adorn, And Dennis scourge the Fools he does not scorn; While Philips' Verse delights the list'ning Swains, And Steele declines the Praise his Merit gains; While Fenton's sadly-pleasing Numbers move, And Granville kindles up a nobler Love. While happy we these tuneful Bards can hear, No Foreign Jargon shall debauch our Ear. Yet warm'd by British Heat, and British Lays, Thou striv'st to turn thy Libel into Praise; Thus Ægypt's Streams in muddy Currents run, And ripen into Monsters by the Sun. In vain thou'rt sanctify'd with Milton's Name, Not even Homer should protect thy Shame; In Pope, that mighty Greek thy Baseness knows, And Zoilus and Homer still were Foes, Murderers like Thee to an Asylum fly, Not to shew Zeal, but hide their Infamy: And with convicted Villains mayst thou go, Guilty of Robbery, and Murder too; For trace thy Steps, and presently we find, The Hand that robb'd Pack's Garden of the Mind, Murdering each Sweet, disguising it for Thine, And making Mortal what he made Divine. ON HIS MISTRESS's Favours. Like Alexander, Cælia spreads her Power, Like Him, She makes the Vassal-World Adore; But, ah! like Him, to sooth a proud Desire, First conquers Towns, then sets those Towns on Fire. TO Mr. POPE. Dear SIR, And sure that fond, familiar Name, May hint, that Friendship is my gen'rous Aim, O then this Frankness of my Heart excuse, And with a Smile confirm the Blushing Muse; Ambitious Hope! yet say, to bless our Eyes, Thy mighty Homer should again arise, Wouldst Thou not pant the wondrous Man to see? Speak from thy inmost Soul!—then censure Me! And as Aloft in laurell'd State You sit, And view below the Subject Sons of Wit; O teach those arduous Ways thro' which you came, And lead Her thro' the flowery Paths of Fame. A Child, as yet, no certain Steps she takes, But, now and then, a wild Excursion makes, Mocks the grave Dictates of Her Guardian Art, Steals from Her Sight, and plays a Wanton's Part: Tho' cross'd my self in every glorious Aim, 'Tis Hope, at least, to be ally'd to Fame. And whilst the Witty, and the Fair commend, It hints some Merit to be call'd Thy Friend. Fir'd at that Word, against my Fate I'll strive, And dare to emulate that Praise I'd give. What, tho' I fail the bold Attempt to gain, Mean were the Thought to think it made in vain. The richest Ore shines useless unreveal'd, And smallest Talents should not be conceal'd. For sure the Muse that Gen'rous Verse inspires, Which Friendship dictates, and Affection fires; Warm'd by a faint Reflexion of thy Flame, My Bosom kindles at immortal Fame; But well I know the Rashness of my Youth, Perhaps these Lines confirm the fatal Truth! No sordid Views could ever yet seduce, The Virgin-Chastness of my youthful Muse; Let venal Bards in State-Promotion play, There Sport like Atoms in the Stream of Day. I never made a wealthy Ideot laugh, Or Israel-like ador'd a Golden-Calf; But when I see true Worth conspicuous shine, I burn to make the bright Alliance mine. Superior to the formal World's controul, Pride in its Charms, and claim a kindred Soul; O! then this Token of my Zeal receive, For next to Merit Praises, is to Give. VERSES: Humbly Inscribed to the Right Honourable Brownlow, Earl of Exeter, &amp;c. Occasioned by the Birth of his Son and Heir the Lord Burleigh. My Root was spread out by the Waters, and the Dew lay all Night upon the Branch: My Glory was fresh in me, and my Bow was renewed in my Hand, Job xxix. 19, 20. From this auspicious Hour let Glory trace, The lengthened Honours of the Cecil's Race; And, as her Eyes indulge the Purple Scene, The glad Procession, and the shining Train, Of Ermin'd Ancestors, and Burleigh's Son, And Annals ever-blending with her own; Weigh ev'ry Worth, and each distinguish'd Claim, To the vast Splendor of superior Fame; Till fairest Omens check her fruitless Care, And fix the long-disputed Lustre here. To polish Worth, and fill the glowing Heart With purest Strains of Honour and Desert; Till finish'd Merit can refine no more, And Nature gives the generous Conflict o'er; Till the last Touch compleats the labour'd Piece, And Glory cries, I'm satisfy'd with This: The Toil of rowling Seasons must engage, The Pangs of Years, the Labour of an Age. In this fair Pledge of Burleigh's endless Name, This happy Earnest of continuing Fame; Let gen'rous Cecil lend one falling Tear, And read the narrow Date Mortality must share. Pass but an Year, an Age, or Æra by, Our Selves, our Merits, and our Names shall dye: The poor capricious Being of a Day, The slender Vassals of a swift Decay. Like shadowy Heroes of a Theatre, Born for a while to Blaze—and disappear; The mould'ring Subject of a scanty Date, Prais'd in this Age—and in the next forgot. But gracious Heaven with healing Care ordains, For transient Merit still its kind Remains; Thus God-like Stems she Labours to retrieve From the dark Bosom of the silent Grave: And by successive Blooms of Worth repays, The hasty Flow of quick-expiring Days. His Course of Glory well has Cecil run; “He ow'd his Britain nothing but a Son, To speed th' immortal Glories of his Line Along the Flood of Ages, and the Flow of Time. If Patriots claim an Int'rest in the Praise, And share the future Glories of their Race: The Father blooms with Triumphs of the Son, And all the distant Merit is his own; Repaid is He that watch'd for Britain's Queen, Nor has great Burleigh merited in vain. Illustrious Youth! to early Fame appear, And answer all Eliza's forming Care: Here in thy own Britannia's Annals learn, What Time and Glory ask from Cecil's Son. Already I survey this watchful Care, To crush the Embryo Seeds of rising War; To Prop the awful Pile of Britain's State, To curb the Rhine, and balance Europe's Fate: Hear Thee proclaim'd thy Country's best Defence, And chose to speak a Loyal Nation's Sense. But O! when Heaven grows envious of his Days, And re-demands her Blessing to the Skies; Let Burleigh join his Labours with thy own, And be the Tutelary Saints of Britain's Throne. J. Taylor, A. B. Div. Johan. Coll. Cant. Upon seeing a Lady at the Musick-Booth at Sturbridge-Fair. By the Same. I Could these faint Numbers glow with equal Fire, To that which in his Breast the Writer feels: Could Phœbus like the Fair Unknown inspire, And Verse, but emulate the Flame it tells, The Lover some Success had found, and she Been known to Fame, tho' lost to Love and Me. II Wound not that Love with too severe a Name, Which was not Chance, but Passion in Excess, Conceal'd the Shaft from whence the Arrow came, My Hopes may be, but not my Anguish less: Strikes not the Light'ning with a Fate as true, Tho' baffled Reason wonder'd whence it flew. III If not in Pity to your Lover's Woes, For your own Sake, at least, your self reveal, Lest when I die, and Thou the latent Cause, You lose a Triumph you deserve so well; Nay, ev'n repaid with all my Suff'rings be, And envy'd by my Fall—if known, I fall by Thee. IV Yet more—a thousand Loves may lurk behind, And half the Course of Glory yet to run; A flowing Wit, discreet, and beauteous Mind, May crown the Conquest which your Eyes begun; Nor bid me dread the thousand Deaths in store, I look'd, I sigh'd, and lov'd—and was undone before! V In vain I, Midnight-Anchorite, must boast Of rugged Maxims, and pedantick Rules, For what is Life, if best Enjoyment lost In the dull Mazes of insipid Schools? Love, must refine what Science scarce began, And mould the Letter'd Savage into Man. VI Let lazy Hermits dream in College-Cells Severely great, and indolently good, Whose frozen Breasts such glimm'ring Rapture swells, As Lifeless, dull Platonicks understood. Go, tell that doating Sage, who looks on Thee With Plato's Eyes, may question if He See. VII Judge now my Passion by severest Truth, And read what rig'rous Justice cannot blame If I have err'd, inform a willing Youth, At lest, mistaken only was my Flame. Was Love a Crime? then teach me to Adore, And Zeal shall be what Passion was before. TO A LADY, That sent me a Flowered Cap. I What Flowers of Rhet'rick can I use These brighter Flowers to commend? What Gift, or Present, can I chuse, Equivalent to send? II I've search'd the Muses fertile Field, But searching no where can find such, Nor even Nature's Self can yield, What I admire so much. III This Token, o'er my Temples spread, A double Power does impart; For as it gently warms my Head, It fires my bleeding Heart. IV But let the blust'ring Storms engage, The ruffling Winds blow high; Thus arm'd I'll mock their empty Rage, And every Blast defy. V Like the bold Grecian-chief I stand, In Arms superior Shine; Like His, they boast an Heavenly Hand, But Skill, much more Divine! VI He did not fear a Wound, 'tis true, From none, except the Deities: And I'm invulnerable too, To All—except my Laura's Eyes. ODE on LIGHT By Mr. Taylor of St. John's College. And God said: Let there be Light, and there was Light, Gen. i. 3. I. All Hail! illustrious Parent of the Day, Hail! thou of Heaven First-born To glad Creation at her Dawn, And gild the growing Harmony. Source of Ages, Flow of Time, By Thee the Hours have fledg'd their Wing. Æras start, and Seasons spring; From Thee they sprung, by Thee they glide Light! ever Fleeting, ever Gay, Light! their Spring, their Lamp, and Guide; Thou measur'st out their Line, And chalk'st their destin'd Way. By thy nimble speeding, Wearied Wish exceeding, Ray on Ray succeeding Will we trace, Thy furious Bound, thy eager Pace, If that all forming Summons to appear, That spoke Thee to exist, and bad Thee canton out the Year. II. Say, to what friendly Aid we owe Those Gleams that in the Minds fair Mirrour play? From what rich Fountain flow Those ripening Beams of intellectual Day? By whose fair Pencil is each Image wrought, That teems to Birth, and burnishes to Thought? How Fancy every Shape puts on? How kindling Sparks her Form compose, And whence the constant-shining Train, That Mem'ry, or Experience shows? How Reason's Lamp burns with incessant Toil, To light the Judgment, and to guide the Will? III. Yet, where benighted Reason strays In Faith's un-navigable Ocean lost, There Heaven a bounteous Light displays, And steers the scatter'd Vessel to the Coast. First in the hallow'd Signs, The glimmering Truth in mystick Notes we trace, Till gather'd in a full Meridian Blaze, The swelling Prospect shines. Thus mimick Colours, on the Canvass laid, Rise, by Degrees, in nice Distinction spread, The Light it self displays, and animates the Shade. IV. Muse, must the Light of Learning die? Muse, forbid Obscurity; Lest, what the rolling Flood of Years had swept away, Rust, and tarnish to Decay; Muse, the fleeting Hours retrieve, And bid forgotten Æras live: Bid the Sister-Arts advance, Swell the Pomp, and crown the Dance, Hark! the Strings obsequious move; See! the bounding Fingers rove; Now the Majestic Epic sails along, Hail the great Notes, and bless the rising Song! Now, in sadly-pleasing Strains, Weeping Elegy complains: Now, now the giddy Lyre Gives Life to Sound, and Sense to Wire; Blending Notes, and Accents changing In broken Airs, and wild tumultuous Fury ranging: Distemper'd Darkness rears her lazy Head, Oblivion quits her gloomy Bed: Science blooms, and Arts refine, Letter'd Ages know In fair Array to glide; Athens revives where Cam and Isis flow. TO Mrs. MARY FREWEN, Upon Her having the Small-Pox. Let Others pensive o'er their Mirrors trace, The beauteous Ruins of a former Face; Nor for thy Beauties, lovely Maid repine, Thy Beauties mingled in a Mould Divine, Can but endure a momentary Pain, And like all Heavenly Substance heal again. And see thy Dangers, and our Fears are o'er, Hearts pant, Sighs heave, and Sorrow streams no more! As Gold by purging Flame still clearer glows, As Virtue from Affliction brighter grows, Sweet e'en in Griefs, and e'en in Pangs serene, Dawn the dear Glories of Euphrenia's Mien; Dear to the Muse, who trembling spreads her Wings, To shrowd the Lover, as her Poet sings; But as he Loves, alas! he Sings in vain, When Beauty's in Affliction, every Strain. When every Charm a thousand Charms resumes, And fair as Eden, from Confusion blooms, Raptur'd He stands, and boldly dares Divine, How to an Angel Thou must once Refine. TO THE Countess of Hertford. Madam, If the following Lines, the Result of my Misfortunes this Morning, can engage your Ladyship's Encouragement to the Poems I propose afterwards, it will be no small Recommendation to their publick Appearance; and, a very great Favour to their Author. Your Ladyship's most Devoted, and most Humble Servant, William Pattison. Fair Patroness of gentle Arts excuse, This rude Address of an unhappy Muse; A Muse, bereft of every worldy View!— Unknown she comes—but then She comes to You! And, if a Stranger's Soul distrestful, Sigh, Tun'd by kind Sympathy, our Souls reply; Explore the Cause thro' a long Train of Ills, And, pitying, share those Woes the Sufferer feels: The Loss of Fortune, Friends, or Fame-Divine,— O grievous Loss! and must I call it mine! And must I still reflect those happier Hours, When, peaceably retir'd, in Granta's Bowers I lay, the pleasing Paths to Learning plann'd, And, Moses-like, just saw the Promis'd-Land. Just saw—but, O my Soul! I live to mourn The joyous Scene, that can no more return! Distrest!—and have my boundless Griefs reveal'd The Thought—Ambition labouring had conceal'd! In vain, for when we dictate from the Heart, Nature will speak at every Pause of Art; And like a bashful Virgin, half exprest, In spite of all the Woman, blush the Rest— Tho' pangful-Martyrs smile upon their Grief To Man, yet Sigh to Him, who sends Relief. Whence then, my Muse, thy Blush, and why thy Tears, 'Tis not the World—alleviate thy Fears; Remember well, that Virtue still the same, Sounds the soft Earnest of immortal Fame! Tho' Want it self might feed her famish'd Eye, And Sorrow sweeten into Harmony! O how I long to change this mournful Strain, But when Fate frowns, the Muses smile in vain! Doom'd by the sad Severity of Fate, And must I bound my Glory with my Hate! It must be so—like Noah's Dove distrest, In vain I wander up and down for Rest, From Spray to Spray I traverse every Tree, And offer up my greenest Branch to Thee! To the Right Honourable the Lord CARTERET. With an indulgent Smile, my Lord, excuse This sadly-true Prediction of the Muse; And may this single Specimen of Woe Speak for the Rest, and all its Author show; Nor blushing let me mourn my Youthful Hours, As vainly spent in the Parnassian-Bowers. By Nature prompted, and a Slave to Fate, I strove to please the Witty, and the Great; Presumptuous hence, nor without Hopes I come To you, and from your Taste await my Doom; From thence implore the Sanction of your Name, To be my Pasport thro' the Gates of Fame. So, Miners, first, the Bullion-Ore refine, Then beg their Monarch's Stamp, to make it Currant-Coin. A HARVEST Scene. Behold—— The Green Fields Yellowing into Corny Gold! White o'er their Ranks, an Old Man half appears, How hale he Looks, tho' hoar'd with seventy Years; His Prospect mounts, slow-pac'd, he strives to climb, And seems some antient Monument of Time; Propt o'er his Staff the reverend Father stands, And views Heaven's Blessings with up-lifted Hands; Gleeful in Heart computes the Year's Increase, And portions out, in Thought, his homely Race, His homely Race before, his Hopes improve, And labour in Obedience for his Love; Sweepy they Cut, then Bind the Sheafy-Grain, And bend beneath the Burthen of the Plain; His chearful Eyes, with silent Praises crown Their Toils, and Smile at Vigour once his own; Till the Mid-Sun to second Nature's Call, Noon-marks the distant Steeple's Ivy'd Wall, Thence warn'd, he waves his Arms, with giddy Haste, The circling Summons to a cool Repaste. EFFIGIES AUTHORIS. Oppress'd with Griefs, with Poverty, and Scorn, Of all forsaken, and of all forlorn, What shall I do? or whither shall I flie? Or what kind Ear will hear the Muse's Cry? With restless Heart from Place to Place I roam, A wretched Vagrant destitute of Home; Driv'n from fair Granta's Shade by Fortune's frown, I came to court the Flatt'rer in the Town. Three tedious Days detain'd me on the Road, Whilst the Winds whistled, and the Torrents flow'd, On my devoted Head the Gusty Breeze, Shook the collected Tempest, from the Trees; For shelter to the Shades, I ran in vain, The Shades deceitful Delug'd me with Rain; Thus when Fate frowns upon our happier Days, Our Friend, perhaps, our Bosom Friend betrays: But as Vicissitudes controul our Fate, And Griefs and Joys maintain a doubtful State, So now the Sun's emerging Orb appears, And with the spungy Clouds dispels my Fears, In Tears the transient Tempest flits away, And all the blue Expansion flames with Day. My gazing Eyes o'er pleasing Prospects roll, And look away the Sorrows of my Soul, Pleas'd at each View, some rueful Thought to draw, And moralize on every Scene I saw; Here, with inviting Pride blue Mountains rise, Like Joys more pleasant to our distant Eyes; In golden Waves, there Tides of Harvest flow, Whilst idle Poppies intermingling grow, How like their Brother Fops an empty show! In every Bush the warbling Birds advance, Sing to the Sun, and on the Branches dance; No Grief, no Cares perplex their Souls with Strife, Like Bards they live, a poor, but merry Life; In every place alike, their Fortunes lie, Both live in want, and unregarded die. With like Concern they meet approaching Death, In Prison, or in Fields, resign their Breath; Musing, I saw, the Fate I could not shun, Shook my grave Head, and pensive travell'd on: But as Augusta's wish'd-for Domes arise, Peep o'er the Clouds, and Dance before my Eyes. What Thoughts, what Tumults fill'd my lab'ring Breast, To be conceiv'd alone, but not express'd; What intermingled Multitudes arose, Lords, Parsons, Lawyers, Baronets, and Beaus, Fops, Coxcombs, Cits, and Knaves of ev'ry Class, While some the better Half, some wholly Ass, On either side bewailing Suppliants stand, Speak with their Looks, and stretch their wither'd Hand. In feeble Accents supplicate Relief, And by their Sorrows multiply my Grief, Mov'd by their Wants, my Fortune I deplore, And deal a Tribute from my slender Store. With Joy, the Favour they receive, and pray, That God, the bounteous Blessing, may repay; Thus providently wise, the lab'ring Swain O'er the plough'd Furrows strews the fertile Grain: The grateful Plain o'er-pays his bounteous Care, With ten-fold Blessings, and a golden Year. Now lost in Thought, I wander up and down Of all unknowing, and to all unknown; Try in each place, and ransack ev'ry News, To find some Friend, some Patron of the Muse: But where? or whom? alas! I search in vain, The fruitless Labour only gives me Pain; But soon each pleasing Prospect fades away, And with my Money all my Hopes decay. But now the Sun diffus'd a fainter Ray, And falling Dews bewail'd the falling Day, When to St. James's Park my Way I took, Solemn in Pace, and sadden'd in my Look: On the first Bench my wearied Bones I laid, For gnawing Hunger on my Vitals prey'd; There faint in melancholly Mood I sate, And meditated on my future Fate. Nights sable Vapours now the Trees invade, And gloomy Darkness deepen'd ev'ry Shade; And now, ah! whither shall the helpless fly, From the nocturnal Horrors of the Sky; With empty Rage my cruel Fate I curse, While falling Tears bedew my meagre Purse; What shall I do? or whither shall I run? How scape the threat'ning Fate I cannot shun; There, trembling Cold, and motionless I lay, Till sleep beguil'd the Tumults of the Day. “Yet tho' this mortal Body was resign'd, “Tormenting Objects terrified my Mind, “Despairing Forms too dreadful for the Light, “Danc'd on my Eyes, and play'd before my Sight; “Here worn with Sorrow, Poverty appear'd, “In ev'ry gastly Form by Mortals fear'd: “And now to make my Wants the more deplor'd, “Prepar'd a plenteous Table richly stor'd. “My Hand I stretch'd impatient of Delay, “When lo! the fictious Treat dissolv'd away, “Despair arose, and shook a deadly Dart, “Then aim'd the thirsty Arrow at my Heart; “Inly I quiver'd, trembled for my Life, “Lost in tumultuous Agony and Grief. “But now a kind, tho' visionary Shade “Gleam'd thro' the Gloom, and Brighten'd all the Glade, “On its fair Head a branching Laurel grew, “And tho' before unseen, the Form I knew; “While thus it spoke—poor Youth thy Fate I mourn, “And weeping make thy Miseries my own: “But patiently resign—I bring Relief, “For as I caus'd, 'tis just, I cure thy Grief. “Then hear—when Morning's beamy Rays arise, “And shoot refulgent Glories thro' the Skies; “To Chiswick's pleasurable Bowers repair, “To guide your wand'ring Path be Thames's Care; “In those fair hospitable Shades you'll find, “Great Burlington, the Muse's surest Friend: “Fam'd Burlington, as humble as He's great, “Pride of the Court, and Bulwark of the State; “To him this visionary Tale disclose, “His Soul will melt in Pity at your Woes. “To him return your long neglected Lyre, “And let his Virtues every Line inspire; “Farewel it said—when as the Morn appear'd, To the warm Rays my dewy Head I rear'd, Amaz'd, half drowzy, waken'd in a fright, I ponder'd on the Vision of the Night; When thoughtless in my Pocket I reveal'd, A latent Six-pence happily conceal'd, Surpriz'd with Transport stood my bristled Hair, On Wings I seem'd to flie, and tread in Air: To the first House I took my speedy Flight, There wrote this recent Vision of the Night; The wond'rous Tale in snowy Foldings bound, Then seal'd the Pasport with a waxen Wound. When prompted by my Genius, swift as Thought, To Chiswick's-Bowers my rueful Story brought; Where now with doubtful Hopes, and Fears, I wait Your bounteous Lordship's Pleasure at your Gate. W. Pattison. ON A Gentleman's Picture. Poets and Painters rival Glories claim, Alike their Labours, and alike their Fame; Apelles by a Homer's-Thoughts design'd, And Homer was the Picture of his Mind: From Both the same immortal Wonders rise, At once in speaking to our Ears, and Eyes; The Pencil's Art, a seeming Likeness gives, But by the Pen alone, that Likeness lives; For Time, that makes those Colours fainter show, Gives Life to these, and makes them brighter grow. But your's bold Artist, claim a longer Date, The great Original preserves their Fate; To future Fame transmit the finish'd Piece, And boast a perfect Parallel with Greece; Nor boast too much—for tho' the Face we find, We lose the noble Image of the Mind: 'Tis ours to draw the Manners, yours the Men, And Painting's but the Shadow of the Pen: Yet happy in your Art, O bless your Fate, 'Tis Honour here enough to Imitate; Whilst we, confounded by your skilful Hand, Think the Draught lives, and fix'd like Pictures stand. VERSES By Way of Contraste to the foregoing Copy, and wrote upon the same Occasion. Crassus, the dullest, most pedantick Fool, That ever humm'd o'er Jargon in a School, Ambitious of attaining endless Fame, At first, by Study thought to raise his Name; For this, by Day, the plodding Pedant por'd; For this, by Night, o'er sacred Sages snor'd; But when he found his dull Attempts were vain, And Nature gave him too much Tongue for Brain: Thinks he the Painter shall these Honours give, And make this Face, at least, in Colours live, Quick as his Word, the Seeds of Fame arise, And lo! the mimick Monster strikes our Eyes! So like! so just the living Copy too, For both were made for Nothing but for shew! O may their Fates to the same End be turn'd, May both be Hang'd, and when decay'd, both Burn'd! On CRASSUS. Dull magisterial Fool, forbear To spit thy pointless Venom here; To more exalted Glories born, Thy mean Indignities I scorn; Secure of Fame, I boast my Lays, While Pope, while Pack, or Congreve praise; Let these but favour what I write, And damn'd, like Thee, be all thy spite: No more shall Duty force my Lays, To gild thy Vanities with praise; If e'er again my Colours strive, To make thy Painter's Daubings live; May Fate, and ev'ry Muse combine, To blast me, and the vile Design; In short, may Heav'n, and all agree, To make me such an Ass as Thee. WOMEN and WINE: AN EPIGRAM. 'Twas a Doubt in Debate among Sages of yore, Whether Women, or Wine, had more absolute Power; Now had I been the Judge, when the Matter was done, Not one had been wiser, than when it begun: For how can Man tell, which the strongest to call, When with the same Ease, both can give him a Fall? NANCY, the Bed-maker. An Imitation of Ovid's Corinna. 'Twas once upon a Summer's Day, As on my downy Bed I lay; All over in a tedious Sweat, To ease my Limbs, and cool the Heat; When pretty Nancy gently came, Nancy, the Object of my Flame! So soft she look'd, so sweet, so fair, With such a winning, yielding, Air; With such an easy comely Pride, She seem'd a lovely, longing, Bride! Obedient to her Eyes command, I seiz'd her warm consenting Hand; Upon the downy Bed display'd, The murm'ring, panting, struggling Maid. There ravish'd, feasted on her Charms, Her heaving Breast, her twining Arms, Her Iv'ry Neck, her roguish Eyes, Her slender Waist, her taper Thighs, With magick Beauties there between Too soft! too dazling to be seen! Melting, I clasp'd them close to mine, And in a Moment grew divine! On a Lady's Erasing the Picture of Bathsheba Bathing, represented in a Snuff-Box. I When Cynthia saw Bathsheba's Charms, In wanton Colours drest, Those Lips, those killing Eyes, those Arms, I dare not name the Rest! II The blushing envious, angry Maid Observ'd with various Passions tost, To ev'ry vulgar Eye betray'd, Those Beauties, she alone could boast. III A fatal Weapon forth she drew, To check the curious Painter's Pride, To veil those Charms, she only knew, Those Beauties only she could hide. IV 'Tis well enamour'd, Damon cry'd, E'en let the paltry Copy fall, By You the Loss is well supply'd, In You we find the Original. AD CÆLUM. Good Heaven! this Mystery of Life explain, Nor let me think I bear the Load in vain; Lest with the tedious Passage chearless grown, Urg'd by Despair I throw the Burden down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ovid, in all his Changes, shews great Art, But Pattison by Nature strikes the Heart. Europa's Bull we find, and Leda's Swan, Sink far beneath that Lordly Creature Man. He never deviates from Creation's-Road, Nor would assume a Brute to be a God. Miscellaneous POEMS. Select Epistles from OVID. Sapho to Phaon. The Argument. I have often, and very justly I think, ranked this beautiful Epistle of Ovid's, among his Masterpieces, both for its refined Touches, and softest Strokes of Nature; the Diction is sweet and harmonious, the Sentiments delicate and tender; and in short, such as a Lady of Sapho's amorous Disposition, as her celebrated Ode represents her, might very justly, and very happily be supposed to write. In the Design of this Epistle, Sapho kindly upbraids her Lover Phaon (who had left her and fled to Sicily) for his cruel and abrupt departure, and by very passionately deploring his absence, endeavours to regain his Affections; concluding with this Resolution, either to recover his Love, or abate her own, by throwing herself from a Rock in Leucadia, famous for relieving Persons in her Distress. Is then this Hand to Phaon's Eyes unknown? Is Sapho then so soon forgotten grown! Can no Remembrance of a former Flame, What not my Love! reflect the Writer's Name? Nor tho' unusual Strains my Measures tell, Enquire a Cause you sure must know too well: Alas! no more the Lute, no more the Lyre, Untun'd by Griefs, my Love-sick Soul inspire: Mix'd with my Tears, my mournful Numbers flow, And my sad Numbers breathe the Voice of Woe. Alas! I burn—but Sighs my Flame inspire, As Winds thro' kindled Corn diffuse the Pire. To glowing Ætna faithless Phaon goes, While more than Ætna in my Bosom glows. Mellifluous Musick now no more can please, Musick can only charm a Mind at ease; Soft soothing Arts on me unartful prove, For as they soothe, they fan the Flames of Love; In vain, my kind Companions, once so dear! With study'd Wiles, amuse my gloomy Care; In vain their friendly Avocations please, Love turns the very Med'cine to Disease: Love's warmer Fires the former Friend controul, For Phaon, dearest Phaon! fills my Soul! Phaon!—so sweet he smiles, then sighs such Darts, That surely 'tis an Heaven to lose our Hearts! Like Bacchus, wou'd the Charmer bind his Brow; Like Phœbus, tune the Lyre, or twang the Bow; Bacchus at his, might feel fresh Blushes rise, And Phœbus trust his Arrows to his Eyes. Yet both these Gods, the Power of Love confess'd, And human Beauties warm'd their Heavenly Breast; Beauties, that ne'er like me, soft Measures knew, To court those Gods, as I have courted you: Yet, tho' my Numbers flow, surpass'd by none, Or to sublime Alceus yield alone, Tho' ev'ry Muse inspire my softer Strain, While Phaon's deaf, alas! I sing in vain! What tho' perhaps my Face can boast no Arts, No Female Magick of alluring Hearts; Yet Nature, for that transient Power declin'd, With Wit's superiour Power improv'd my Mind: Short tho' my Stature, yet my lofty Name O'er the wide World distends my deathless Fame; If fair I am not, yet a swarthier Face Cou'd charm young Perseus to a dear Embrace. The jetty Turtle seeks the silver Dove, Yet both, you know, are call'd the Birds of Love. With various Colours, various Colours join, And Vivids with Cerulæan Azure shine: But if such Nymphs, as not your Equals prove, You ne'er can love, alas! you ne'er can love. Nor should I think too humbly of these Charms, That once could win a Phaon to my Arms; That once—for ah! how Love records each Joy! That once alone could Phaon's Soul employ! Ev'n Trifles then, like Magick Charms could move, And ev'ry Trifle was a Charm of Love: Whene'er my Musick breath'd, you bless'd the Song, And o'er my rising Neck enamour'd hung; With speaking Eyes confess'd the pleasing Pain, And with a dying Softness drank the Strain: At ev'ry Note, you led away a Heart, At ev'ry Look, receiv'd a double Dart; 'Till panting at the flowing Joy we sigh'd, Mix'd our warm Souls, and into Life we dy'd! The soft Sicilians now thy Soul subdue, Gods that I were a soft Sicilian too! Nor boast, ye Nymphs! the Conquest of your Eyes, Tho' glorious, yet delusive is the Prize! If ye, like me, the Tempter's Oaths believe, Too soon they'll conquer, and too soon deceive! Prov'd by my Fate, experienc'd are his Arts, And constant only, in destroying Hearts. Oh Venus! since Sicilia owns thy Power, To these fond Arms, the roving Youth restore; Indulgent to my Strains, afford a Cure, Or teach my Soul her Sorrows to endure. With my first Years, began my early Grief, And must Misfortunes lengthen with my Life! Corroding Sorrows canker'd all my Bloom, Sprung from my Parents too untimely Tomb. My Brother next opprobrious to our Race, His Fame polluted by a lewd Embrace: A Pyrate now, repairs his squander'd Wealth, And what by Lust he lost, regains by Stealth. Oft with a Sister's Care, the Youth I warn'd, But he my Care, with haughty Taunts return'd; A much-lov'd Daughter's Fate distracts me now, Adds Grief to Grief, and Misery to Woe! Yet, these Afflictions, Reason might controul, Did not more deep Afflictions sting my Soul; Did not thy Wrongs, the last, the greatest prove, For neither Death, nor Fortune wound like Love. No more my Robes the costly Fair display, No more my Fingers dart a Diamond Day; No more my flowing Looks enstarr'd, exhale The clouding Odours of Arabia's Gale; But, all disorder'd with the ruffling Air, Denote a Mind disorder'd more with Care: On whom should these alluring Arts be shown But him I love? And him I love is gone! What killing Arrows wound my tender Heart? Yet, such is Love, I bless the killing Dart. For so the Fates my vital Thread ordain, And sure they spun it from a Lover's Chain! What Arts I try to chase my Cares away? How all my Actions all those Arts betray! In vain I touch the Lute, or sweep the Lyre, Soft Musick but indulges soft Desire: Harmonious Charms in vain my Fancy move, For ah! far stronger are the Charms of Love, Far stronger are thy soft enchanting Charms! Who would not die to clasp thee in her Arms!— For thee, Aurora, Cephalus might scorn, Nor blush to paint her Passion on the Morn; Cynthia, for thee, Endymion might despise, And gild her Crescent with thy brighter Eyes: Venus would place thee with the Gods above, Would not thy Charms supplant the God of Love. Oh dear enchanting Youth! transporting Boy! The Bloom of Life, the Spring of Love enjoy: To my soft Breast in Tides of Transports flow, There Phaon,—take the Love you won't bestow. See! while I write, my Eyes in Torrents stream, To kiss, and mingle with dear Phaon's Name! Dear Phaon! Yet this Phaon left me tho'— Can Lovers leave a melting Mistress so? Could no deceitful Sigh, no lying Tear, Express at least a counterfeited Fear! If not your Love, your Gratitude to shew, You might have utter'd formally, Adieu. Nor could that Accent, like this Silence wound, Thy soothing Tongue had soften'd the harsh Sound. No Kiss you breath'd, the Lover's last Relief, No Kiss receiv'd, nor left me aught but Grief! No Gift I gave, nor cou'd my Gifts impart, So pure a Token as my love-sick Heart! No binding Vows we join'd, our Faith to prove, Alas! I trusted to the Bonds of Love! Nor, had I known your Flight, had utter'd more Than—Live, and love your Sapho, as before. By ev'ry Muse that e'er my Mind possess'd, By Love, that Guardian of thy cruel Breast, When doubtful Fame at first proclaim'd thee gone, Such swift cold Shiv'rings thro' my Pulses run, My startled Soul alarm'd by Grief, like you Had nearly fled, her Phaon to pursue; Speechless a-while I bore the desp'rate Strife, And seem'd a frozen Monument of Grief: 'Till Storms of Sighs that long imprison'd lay, Burst out, and stream'd in Tides of Tears away. Distracted, griev'd, I beat my lab'ring Breast, And each Extravagance of Grief express'd. Less pang'd, the widow'd Parent makes her Moan, Less griev'd, deplores her dead, her darling Son. My Brother too, if such his Nature shows, With an insulting Pride enjoys my Woes; With scornful Comfort counterfeits Relief, Intruding breaks, and aggravates my Grief. “Thy Daughter lives (he cries) then why these Cares? “And whence this Female Flood of idle Tears? At this, I rave, my wounded Bosom tear, And raging, to the World my Wrongs declare; Accuse thy Crimes, regardless of my Fame, For Love, alas! is ever blind to Shame! And what is Fame, or all, compar'd to thee? Thou! thou art Fame, Life, Love, ah!—All to me! Thy dear Idea all my Soul employs, Streams in my Tears, and sparkles in my Joys: Thy dear Idea wounds my lonesome Days, By Night, my Griefs, with kinder Dreams repays: When bound in those soft Banes, I taste thy Charms, And sink incircled in thy softer Arms: Then, then I feel thee to my Soul return! Phaon, the same in all, except thy Scorn. Then Phaon! then, thy balmy Lips I press; And then, thy balmy Lips repeat the Kiss! Repeated Kisses animate Desire, And breath'd in Whispers blow the rising Fire; 'Till kindling at a Soul-dissolving Sigh, Fainting, o'er-power'd I pant—and melting die Away in Joys, that only Lovers know, In Joys, that only can from Phaon flow: In Joys, that soon their Author's Arts betray; Like Phaon, charm!—like Phaon flit away! Wing'd with the Dawn, they take their hasty Flight, And the Morn blushes at the dear Delight; When I, again deceiv'd, again betray'd, With study'd Slumbers court the fleeting Shade; In vain,—the Sun emergent, pours the Day, And the deluding Phantom melts away. A Stranger to the balmy Joys of Rest, Raving I rise, and beat my throbbing Breast; Frantic, to some Night-shaded Grot repair, Wild as my Thoughts, and dark as my Despair: The Grot that once our mutual Pleasures knew, In plaintive Echoes murmurs to my Woe; O'er the rough Rocks, my musing Eyes I roll, There view the savage Image of my Soul; See Nature's Hand her simple Works impart, Superiour to the Mimickries of Art. How thick-brow'd Rocks with mossy Horror frown, And wildly emulate the polish'd Stone; O'er-arching Forests crown the solemn Scene, And wave with gloomy Pleasure o'er the Plain. Oft, as I sigh my former Joys, explore Embrown'd with Shades the dear frequented Bower; Each Bank, the Treasury of Love survey, But find, alas! the Treasure lost away; Press the dear Place, where dearer Phaon lay, And sigh, and weep, and slumber out the Day: Bath'd with my Eyes, the Grass my Anguish wears, Imbibes my Woes, and seems to weep my Tears. As livery'd with Grief, the Groves appear, And seem, like me, to shiver with Despair; The Groves in leafy Tears, their Phaon weep, And the sad Birds their Songs in Sorrow steep; No tuneful Notes amuse the silent Plains, No Sounds, but Philomela's mournful Strains; With Philomela's Strains, I murmur mine, And to her Tereus, faithless Phaon join. To Slumber sacred, and serene Repose, In silver Sounds a crystal Current flows; A flow'ry Lotos shades the velvet Green, Fans the cool Streams, and paints the floating Scene; Here, as I late repos'd my weary Head, An azure Nereid rose, and rising said, “Unhappy Nymph! by Love betray'd, arise, “And boldly seek the fam'd Leucadian Seas; “A Rock there stands by great Apollo's Fane, “A Charm for those, who love like thee, in vain: “Deucalion once by Pyrrha's Scorn oppress'd, “Here quench'd his Flame and freed his lab'ring Breast; “The Flame reviv'd, in Pyrrha's Bosom burn'd, “And all her Scorn to softer Passion turn'd: “Like him resolv'd, perform the lofty Leap, “Nor dread the Dangers of the distant Deep. She said, and sinking in the circling Flood, From my dim Eyes the streaming Sorrow flow'd. I fly, Oh Nymph! I fly the Charm to prove, Strong are my Fears! but stronger is my Love! Resolv'd, I fly, enflam'd by fierce Disdain; Assuage I may, but not increase my Pain! With the soft Gales, oh Love! be kinder now, Hover thy Wings, and ease my Fall below: Decreas'd by Cares, nor let my guiltless Blood With blushing Stains pollute the sacred Flood! Then shall my Lyre Apollo's Temple grace, And, grateful, wear inscrib'd this votive Verse; “This Lyre on Phœbus, Sapho's Hand bestow'd, “A tuneful Off'ring on a tuneful God; “May the same God, with kind indulgent Power, “Protect the sacred Lyre he tun'd before! Yet, why oh Phaon! must I seek the Main, When you alone, that caus'd, can ease my Pain; Shall the rough Rock, and savage Ocean prove More soft than one, by Nature form'd for Love! Thy stronger Charms have Magick to prevail, Where all those Charms, and ev'n their God can fail. Methinks, thou could'st not rather see me lie, Dash'd on sharp Rocks, than on thy Bosom sigh! Could'st thou thus doom these tender Breasts of mine, From panting, growing, melting into thine: These Breasts that once could all thy Soul employ, And beating kindle dear Alarms to Joy! Alas! in vain they charm'd, that charm'd no more, Now swell'd with Griefs, that swell'd with Joy before! Ye Lesbian Nymphs, no more my Lays require, Lost is the Poet's, in the Lover's Fire! No more my Voice with wonted Musick sings, No more my Hand awakes the warb'ling Strings: Since my dear Phaon, since my Love Divine— Ah me! my Tongue would still pronounce thee mine: Since from these Arms the faithless Phaon fled, Dull are my Strains, and all my Fancy's dead. But, oh! ye Nymphs, engage his quick Return, Then shall my Breast with wonted Ardour burn; Transporting Strains revive my lofty Lyre, And Love the long-neglected Lute inspire. How canst thou, Phaon, so obdurate prove, Deaf to each Charm, and ev'ry Art of Love! Alas! in vain, I fear, my Prayers I sigh, Like me, I fear my Prayers in Silence die! Waft them, ye Gales, to wand'ring Phaon's Ear, And with them, join to waft the Wand'rer here. Swift as the Gales, my ling'ring Love convey, How my Soul suffers by this long Delay! Fair Beauty's Queen shall smooth her Parent Seas, Lull the loud Winds, and smile the Waves to Peace: Love, Love himself the flying Course shall guide, Swell the soft Sails, and waft the floating Tide. But if poor Sapho must for ever mourn, And if You Phaon never will return; If endless Absence must increase my Pain, O! let one Line confirm that cold Disdain! Despairing, then those kinder Rocks I'll try, And there, forget to love, or learn to die. OEnone to Paris. The Argument. When Hecuba was with Child of Paris, she had a Dream of her being delivered of a Firebrand: Priam, upon this, consulting the Oracle, was told, that, the Infant she went with, should cause the Destruction of Troy; Priam therefore resolved at its Birth, that it should be torn to pieces by wild Beasts. Hecuba privately conveys away the Boy to Mount Ida, leaving him to the Shepherds care. Here, in process of Time, he became enamoured with the Nymph OEnone. But at last, being found out, he went upon an Expedition to Greece, and carried Hellen to Troy; OEnone hearing thereof, writes him this Epistle. These Lines my lovely faithless Swain peruse, If yet your Bride such Liberty allows; No Rage they threaten from resenting Greece, No News relate obnoxious to your Peace, For poor OEnone now, tho' once so dear, Below your Grandeur, is below your Care! Yet hear, tho' deaf to Love, yet hear her Moan; And listen to those Joys, you deign'd to crown. What cruel Gods thus emulous could prove, Destroy our Happiness, and blast our Love! What Guilt of mine could call their Vengeance down! If Love can be the Crime, the Crime's their own: Ills when deserv'd, in Patience find Relief; But, when thus hardly borne, dissolve to Grief! Yet, once there was a Time, when Ida's Plain Confess'd no Title but the lovely Swain; When I, the fairest of the rural Fair, Warm'd your young Breast, and was your only Care; When you, a Shepherd, with the Shepherds strove, And innocently won me into Love: Sooth'd with those harmless unaffected Charms, Heedless, I caught the Passion from your Arms. In my dear Paris center'd all my Joy, And all OEnone fill'd my faithful Boy. How happy then we languish'd out the Day! Toy'd in soft Shades, and slept in new-made Hay. How happy then we languish'd out the Night! New Joys returning with returning Light! Fresh as the Morn, I join'd the Sylvan Chace, And tun'd the Chorus of the latrant Race; With you the Groves I rang'd, the Fields beset, And watch'd the Motions of the swelling Net: With you retiring to the breezy Shade, Cool Fruits, and slaking Streams our Thirst allay'd. There, on each Tree you carv'd our mutual Names, And with the living Letters grew our Flames: While Love, recording with a keener Dart, Engrav'd each Token deeper on my Heart! Close by a Stream, and bord'ring on a Grove, A Beech now bears this Token of our Love; Long may it bear! long stand the Test of Years! And flourish by the Sanction of this Verse! “When Paris his OEnone falsly leaves, “Xanthus! like him be false, reverse thy Waves. Reverse thy Waves, O Stream! return again, And murm'ring, mourn with me my faithless Swain! Curst be that Day! my blooming Hope's Annoy! Date of my Griefs, and Period of my Joy! When the bright Powers descended from the Skies, To learn the Judgment of your brighter Eyes. This when you told, my dead'ning Heart was struck, And all my Soul with sudden Horror shook: Each Sage, consulted warn'd some Change too near, Increas'd my Sorrows, and confirm'd my Fear! But when prepar'd, your Fleet at Anchor lay, To bear my fond, believing Heart away; How spoke those parting Eyes! O ne'er reprove The noble Tenders of a virtuous Love! How lock'd in Folds these clasping Arms I cast! Nor Vines, nor Ivy circle Elms so fast! Nor Elms when shook with Winds o'ercharg'd with Dew, Whispers such Sighs, or drop such Tears as you. What Sighs! what Tears! what Tenderness express'd Your Soul dissolving on my panting Breast! What kind! what dear—enchanting Sorrows fell, To sooth, and soften that harsh Sound, Farewel! Still the harsh Sound sunk deeper in our Heart, And still we met a thousand Times to part! The Sailors wonder'd at your tedious Stay, But Love still fram'd Excuses for Delay. 'Till now, at last the long-expecting Gales, Rais'd by our Sorrows, fill'd the swelling Sails, With slow reluctant Feet our Way we bend, And sadly-loving on each other lean'd; With melancholy Steps approach'd the Shore, Stop'd at each dear Recess; now dear no more! Survey'd each solitary Scene of Love, And bid adieu to ev'ry lonesome Grove; The lonesome Groves, as if they sorrow'd too, Wav'd by the Gales, submissive bow'd, Adieu! And now the last, dear parting Kiss was given, And now the last, dear Vow was breath'd to Heaven; When to the Shore the hast'ning Vessel row'd, And dancing off, seem'd lighter with its Load: My streaming Eyes the floating Fleet pursue, Their Griefs increasing at the less'ning View; But when the pleasing Prospect sunk in Air, My melting Heart I view'd, and view'd thee there; Each Power I weary with imploring Cries, Swell with my Tears the Floods, the Winds with Sighs: In soft-beseeching, plaintive Murmurs mourn, And court the Nereids for your quick Return. The list'ning Nereids soon my Swain restore, But ah! how chang'd from what he was before! How chang'd his Manners, and how chang'd his Name! Ev'n nothing but those Eyes remain the same; Those dear-deluding Eyes, those blooming Charms Are still the same to all—except these Arms! Beat by the Tides, and crown'd with waving Woods, A lofty Mountain rises o'er the Floods; Here daily with expecting Looks I sat, By turns dejected, and by turns elate; From hence, at last, I saw your Streamers play, Waft o'er the Floods, and drink the beamy Day; So gay, so bright, the fierce Effulgence shone, The Sails emerging seem'd a rising Sun: Struck by the Splendour of the pompous Show, My gazing Eyes could scarce believe 'twas you; But more confounded, more amaz'd, I see A Rival-Beauty sit, and sit by thee; With those soft Locks her wanton Fingers play'd, Her Head reclining on your Bosom laid. Stung to the Soul, with Fury fir'd, I stood, Now thought to quench it in the roaring Flood; Now to the plaintive Groves my Griefs I pour, And sigh my Sorrows in a silent Shower. How shall I mourn those dear enchanting Charms! How curse the cruel Rival of these Arms! O! may those Charms to her as fatal prove! O! may she mourn like me neglected Love! Tho' now far-distant Nations learn your Fame, Tho' foreign Ladies catch the flying Flame; Yet when an humble Swain your Flocks you fed, No Princess, but OEnone, knew your Bed; No gaudy Title plum'd the golden Dart, 'Twas Love and Innocence surpriz'd my Heart; When melting in the Circle of these Arms, You swore you sought no Glory like such Charms; No Pomps, no Dignities desir'd to prove, Unless to raise your Merits to my Love: Of all those Dignities I ask no part, Desire to share in nothing but your Heart! For that alone, I wish indulgent Fate, High as my Love, would raise my humble State; Then should no Rival the vain Triumph boast, But Pomp regain the glorious Prize it lost! Nor need your Royal Parents blush to own, A Daughter much more virtuous than their Son. Say, do your silken Sofa's gentle prove Softer than these sweet sylvan Scenes of Love? Say, can your Hellen, bright in guilty Charms, Like innocent OEnone please your Arms? Can study'd Sounds indulge a purer Dream, Than the wild Musick of this purling Stream? Here, no rude Fears the slumbring Soul annoy, No fierce Alarms intrude but those of Joy! Yet these, and more than these, must sure affright The false Possessor of another's Right: Tho' sweet her Charms, those Charms must be restor'd, When Justice rouzes their avenging Lord. But, does your Sire approve your loose Desires? Does sage Antenor's Wisdom fan your Fires? Should Troy assist, and second your Resolve, Yet would a prudent Prince his Land involve? Would any warlike Chief his Weapon draw To brave the Gods, and violate the Law? But soon your Fair, your boasted Fair, may change, Condemn her Choice, and chuse again to range, Some fond Variety may long to prove, And turn, like you, a Commoner in Love; Like you, Atrides once enjoy'd her Charms; You too, like him, may mourn deserted Arms. And should your Force the ravish'd Bride regain, Her Innocence can ne'er return again. O bless'd Andromache! whose kinder Fate Bestows a Spouse, as virtuous, as he's great; From her firm Loyalty I copy'd mine, O could her Hector's so in Paris shine! But faithless Paris, wanton as the Wind, Light as the Leaves, enjoys a fickle Mind; Quick as the Winds his wand'ring Thoughts are past, And, like the Leaves, are turn'd with ev'ry Blast! Too well my fatal Fortunes now unfold What once prophetical Cassandra told; When swell'd, and lab'ring with Divinity, Full of the God she cry'd, and cry'd to me. Cease, Nymph, to plough these barren Lands, O cease, These barren Lands shall yield no kind Increase, The Grecian Heifer shall your Hopes destroy, Despoil your Cares, and prove the Bane of Troy! She comes! good Heaven divert her fatal Way— Sink! sink the Ship! and plunge it in the Sea: What Flames of Rage! what Deluges of Blood! O! quench them! drown them in the whelming Flood. She said: her Servants the mad Priestess caught, And left my gloomy Soul involv'd in Thought; Ah! now too plain the Fates the Heifer seize, For Hellen reaps the Harvest of the Seas. Fair tho' she be, would any, but a Whore, With one unknown forsake her Native Shore, Neglect her Honour, disregard her Life, And stain the Duty of a virtuous Wife? But lost to ev'ry Sense of honest Fame, She nothing but reiterates her Shame: Debauch'd by Theseus, blushes now no more, And laughs at Scruples she might fear before. When young, with him she stole a base Escape; Tho' her Friends smooth the Story with a Rape; Pretend the Ravisher restor'd her Charms Untouch'd, untasted from his longing Arms: Let those that will believe the specious Art— Her Eyes had Power, he a Lover's Heart! And she that once but yields to loose Desires, For ever burns in those unlawful Fires. But I, because a Stranger to those Thoughts, Must mourn my Virtues, as I mourn my Faults. Should I, like you, my plighted Faith betray, Well might you spare the Crime, who lead the Way! How sacred, how inviolate my Love! How clear my Honour! witness every Grove! Mov'd by their fruitless Hopes, the rural Train Declare their Passion, but declare in vain: For me, the Sylvan Powers forsake their Shades, And kindly court me to their cooling Glades; With ever-living Wreaths adorn their Hair, And for my sake, the Lover's Garland wear. Ev'n He, the God whose Rays the World inspire, Despair'd to set my virtuous Breast on fire, With ev'ry soothing Blandishment he try'd, But Honour ev'ry Blandishment defy'd. Despis'd his Proffers with disdainful Eyes, And scorn'd the Lover in the sordid Price; 'Till Flame increasing, as his Flatt'ry fail'd, The baffled Lover in the God prevail'd: Nor could his Strength an easy Conquest boast, I lost reluctant, what at last I lost. With streaming Eyes atton'd the base Abuse, And hope'd the Author could the Crime excuse: Mov'd by my Wrongs, and influenc'd by my Grief; The grateful God administred Relief; Inspir'd each wise, medicinary Power, To sooth my Sorrows, and my Soul restore; Disclos'd each Secret, open'd ev'ry Art; Taught to save Life—but not a Lover's Heart! Here, all his Secrets, all his Arts must fail! Nor could the God his own Distemper heal. But charming Paris! lovely, faithless Swain! 'Tis you alone can give, and ease that Pain! Your Arts alone beyond the Gods can prove, And speak a greater God, at least in Love! O haste my Paris! my Complaints regard, My Sorrows pity, and my Truth reward! In loose, unlawful Flames no longer burn, But, where you left your Innocence return; There let our early sacred Passions shine, Rejoin their Lustre, and commence Divine. Paris to Hellen. The Argument. Paris being gone to Sparta in quest of Hellen, whom Venus had promised him as the Reward of his Judgment in assigning to her the Prize of Beauty, was there nobly entertained by her Husband Menelaus; who being sent for to take Possession of the Effects of his Grandfather Atreus, at Crete, earnestly recommends Paris to Hellen's Care. During his absence, Paris commences her Suitor, and writes her the following Epistle. All Health to thee, fair Nymph! thy Paris sends All Health to thee, on whom, his own depends: Must I then speak? and must my Tongue reveal A Secret, which my Eyes too plainly tell? O! could I hide the Wish I fear to name! Would rather kinder Fortune guide my Flame! My Flame! that, spite of all Restraints, displays Its rising Force, and ev'n it self betrays; In private, prompts my tim'rous Tongue to prove, To thee, my beauteous, charming Nymph, I love: I love! may no severe Reproof controul, The true, the tender Message of my Soul! May no fierce Passions that soft Bosom fire, But such as kindle, such as feed Desire. How bless'd these Lines obey my soft Command, To see that Face, and touch that melting Hand! Yet, if my Hopes, and Promises are true, I, soon, like them, may kiss those Fingers too: For know, fair Nymph, to justify my Flame, 'Twas by the Gods, the Gods Command, I came; Else, nor my Pride, nor Vanity could dare, To whisper at your Feet a dying Prayer. Led by the Promise of the Queen of Charms, I come to court her Image to my Arms: For this, the Goddess brought me thro' the Sea, And calm'd old Ocean as she led the way; For this, soft Cupids fann'd the wasting Gales, And with kind Whispers swell'd the silken Sails. Still may such gracious Powers controul the Main, Still kind to Voyagers, like me remain! And as they lull'd the Roarings of the Deep, O! may they lull my raging Fears asleep; Compose my troubled Soul to peaceful Rest, And guide my Heart to harbour in your Breast. Led by no Error, by no Tempest tost, I landed on the Confines of your Coast; No mercenary Prospects I pursue, Prospects too far below a Lover's View! The Fates, already, have bestow'd me Store So large, that only you can make it more. Nor came I here a gazing Spy to prove, For what could I discover, blind with Love? For thee, bright Nymph! for those dear Charms I came, The Gift, the Promise of the Cyprian Dame; Thy lovely Person, tho' unseen, I knew, My Wishes, all my Soul was fix'd on you: Nor wonder, how, so far, my Breast was fir'd, When Fate, and Love, with Eyes like yours conspir'd; To reconcile your Faith, my Story hear; Believe the Wonder, and the Gods revere. E'er yet my labouring Mother brought me forth, Whilst I lay strug'ling for the Pangs of Birth; By the Delusion of a mighty Dream, She thought, her Offspring prov'd a Torch on flame: Amaz'd, the Vision to my Sire she told, And thus, the summon'd Seers the Fates unfold. “That I to Troy a future Flame should prove— How well the Prophets pointed at my Love? My Parents, mov'd by superstitious Care, To shun the Danger, and avert their Fear, Committed me to the Ideän Swains, Doom'd to the simple Pleasure of the Plains; But soon, my growing Years disclos'd a Mind Superior to those humble Ends design'd; Intrinsically great, my Virtues shone, And, tho' eclips'd, they seem'd to claim a Throne. A tow'ring Hill there stands in Ida's Grove, Unbrowz'd its Turf, and dark with Shades above; Here, as with musing Eyes, I once survey'd, Troy's Turrets rising thro' the misty Shade; A sudden Sound of Feet, I seem'd to hear, And quick Commotions echo'd on my Ear; When to my Sight a Form Divine appear'd, And Maija's Son, the Form Divine declar'd; My wond'ring Eyes confess'd the Heav'nly Power, Known by the Wand, and Silver Plumes he wore. But soon I saw, descending from above, Saturnia, Pallas, and the Queen of Love; Aw'd by superior Majesty, I stood, And, trembling, heard the missionary God, Who thus bespoke my Fears—“Shepherd! be bold— “These Rivals for their orient Fruit, behold; “Here—to the fairest Form adjudge the Prize; “The brightest Present to the brightest Eyes; “In this, obey th' Almighty Mandate given— He said, and rising, slowly sail'd to Heaven. And now, my Strength restor'd, my Thoughts renew'd, Distinctly each cœlestial Fair I view'd; On each, my Eyes, alternately, were cast, And ev'ry Look was vanquish'd by the last. Alike, they all deserv'd my voting Voice, But one, and only one, must win my Choice; Now this I found, now that, now ev'ry Part, The momentary Tenant of my Heart. On ev'ry Side persuasive Gifts assail'd, To buy my Favour, where my Judgment fail'd. Great Juno laid whole Empires at my Feet, Minerva proffer'd deathless Wreaths of Wit; While thus the sweet-enchanting Queen of Smiles, (Securely laughing at their vainer Wiles.) “Shall such unworthy Gifts thy Kindness move? “Thy tender Soul was surely tun'd to Love! “To me, my Swain, to me, thy Smiles incline, “And Hellen, fairest Hellen shall be thine; “My Wishes crown'd, enjoy her brighter Charms, “And reign a greater Monarch in her Arms. So soft she spoke, so sweetly glanc'd her Eyes, Transported, I resign'd the glitt'ring Prize; Deceiv'd, the baffled Deities withdrew, Back to her Skies the lovely Victress flew. And now the Fates, to call my Glories forth, Disclos'd the long-hid Secret of my Birth; With Joy receiv'd, in princely Pomp I shone, And Acclamations hail'd the Royal Son; What Numbers flow'd, fair Beauty's Judge to see! And not a Lady languish'd but for me: Soft Nymphs, enamour'd at the passing Show, Yielding, confess'd the Flames I feel for You: Ev'n Princesses with rival Ardour strove, To warm my Bosom, and to win my Love; For me they sicken'd, and for me they sigh'd, But for imagin'd Hellen, were deny'd: For You alone, my Soul conceiv'd Desire, Unknown, ador'd, and burn'd in fancy'd Fire; Your dear Idea all my Bosom charm'd, Amaz'd me waking, and when slumb'ring warm'd; No wonder then those Eyes so potent prove, Whose very Thoughts could melt my Mind to love. Now, fir'd with Hopes, impatient of Delay, And all in Transport for the happy Day, With eager Haste, the neighb'ring Groves I fell'd, To fit my Voyage, and my Fleet to build; Quick to my Wish, the naval Streamers rise, And swelling Streamers flutter in the Skies; Gay painted Figures gild the Poops below, And wanton in the Waters as they flow: Here, Venus views each wave-reflected Grace, And smiles her Parent-Ocean into Peace; Young, flutt'ring Cupids round the Goddess play, Court the cool Breeze, and quiver in the Sea. And now prepar'd to seek your happy Shore, With ardent Prayers my Friends my Stay implore; Condemn my Rashness, urge the stormy Main, Foretel my Dangers, but foretel in vain: My Sister too, prophetically bold, Fore-warn'd my Fate, and thus my Fortune told. “O! whither does my Brother run? (she cry'd) “Blind to those Flames, to which these Waters guide! “Those fatal Flames! that with him shall return, “And, spite of quenching Oceans Ilion burn! How right her Prophecies your Eyes exprest? How right, divin'd the Flames that burn my Breast? But while these fabling Fears in vain withstand, The favouring Winds convey me to your Land; When now fulfilling Heaven's Decree, your Spouse Receiv'd me at your hospitable House; With free Reception, kindly entertain'd, And shew'd me all the Glories of the Land: But all with cold Indifference, I view, Blind was my Sight to ev'ry Thing, but You: But when your fair-fam'd Beauties struck my Eyes, Sure Heaven with Wonder witness'd my Surprize; What secret Transports trickled thro' each Part, Beam'd on my Eyes, and trembled to my Heart! From Vein to Vein, the dancing Message flew, And all my panting Soul confess'd 'twas You. So look'd the heart-enchanting Queen of Love, When with the rival Goddesses she strove: But had your self been there, those brighter Eyes, From each contending Power, had gain'd the Prize. Those radiant Eyes, the mighty Boast of Fame, Each Land eclipse, and all the World inflame; What Nymph, but you, can boast so sweet a Face? How fair the Nymph, that claims the second Place! Shines there on Earth a Form so heavenly fair, But thine would suffer by the low Compare? Struck from Report, thy Beauties I receiv'd, Amaz'd, admir'd, but doubtfully believ'd; Yet now I find Report but wrong'd your Frame, So vast your Charms! so weak the Voice of Fame! Well might that Face omniscient Theseus fire, Well might it such a glorious Theft inspire; When those amazing Beauties shone expos'd, And all the real Goddess stood disclos'd: Ne'er was his boasted Wisdom better show'd Than when he snatch'd you from the gazing Crowd; But such a Prize so calmly to restore, Confess'd his Folly, as his Wit before. Should Paris thus resign those sacred Charms, Should Paris thus remit them from his Arms; Sooner should Heaven with Light'ning blast me dead! And level triple Thunders at my Head! If wrested from my Arms, the Joys were forc'd, I'd make them mine, at least enjoy them first; Ravish so lasting Token of my Bliss, And steal Eternities in every Kiss. O! try my Courage! prove your faithful Swain, And learn, that Paris never boasts in vain. Not ev'n 'till Death, my Passion shall expire, And then Love's Flames shall light my funeral Pyre. When Beauty's doubtful Cause by me was try'd, And the fair Rivals crown'd the fount-ful Ide, For Thee, the Pomp of Empires I despis'd, And thy dear Charms beyond all Empires priz'd; To those deep Wonders that from Wisdom rise, Preferr'd the silent Eloquence of Eyes; Nor can I ever at my Choice repine, So Hellen, promis'd Hellen be but mine! Were she but mine, I'd make my Wish compleat, And snatch ev'n Joys beyond the reach of Fate! But, lest Alliances disgrace your Line, Know, Fair! my Lineage is, like yours, Divine; From Dardanus, our Ancestry I prove, Begot! descended, and belov'd by Jove: What need I farther long Successions trace? Fam'd are the Founders of the Trojan Race! Wide o'er the World, our large Domains extend, And with the World alone, our Glories end: But when your self shall prove our Grandeur true, You'll own Fame false to us, as well as You. How shall your Eyes our lofty Domes admire, Built to the Strains of the Phebeän Lyre! How gaze with Wonder on sublime Abodes, Fit to receive their tutelary Gods! What Nymphs, what num'rous Beauties shalt thou see, Nymphs! far superior to all Nymphs, but thee! What heaping Crowds! what glitt'ring Tides surprize! What Pomp, what Grandeur strike your ravish'd Eyes! While you, confounded with Amazement, cry, “How poor is all our Greece compar'd with Troy! Not that your Spartan Cities I despise, Blest be the Place that gave fair Hellen Rise! Beauty, like yours, may well atone for Store, Sparta, with Hellen, can desire no more: Yet, brightest Nymph! those Charms were ne'er design'd To brighten Shades, and be to Shades confin'd; Beauty, like thine, was made to grace a Throne, And lend new Lustre to a sparkling Crown; Beauty, like thine, superior to thy Fame, Should glow in Splendor, speak a Trojan Dame! Nor scorn to take a Trojan to thy Arms, Who, like a Trojan, can deserve thy Charms? A Trojan graces the divine Abodes, And fills the foamy Nectar to the Gods, A Trojan charm'd the Queen of springing Light, And warm'd the frozen Empress of the Night; A Trojan, Beauty's sacred Power comprest, And yielding Venus panted on his Breast: O! let me too my Country's Glory prove, Charm, and enjoy a brighter Queen of Love! Nor think that Menelaus can compare With me in Cupid's, or the Camp of War; At least I should not fear the Point to try, Or trust the Judgment to your conscious Eye: But were you mine, no Kindred could disgrace, No bloody Atreus stain your Royal Race; No Pelopean Guilt, to blot your Name, Or cloud the rising Glories of your Fame: No Sire of mine, like Tantalus, is curst, Starv'd amidst Stores, and parch'd in Floods with Thirst. Yet, whilst I talk, a Wretch confines you now, Sprung from that Race, perhaps as impious too; A Wretch! that, like his Grandsire, ne'er enjoys The tempting Fruit, or if he does, it cloys: Shame to the Genealogy of Jove! Flat are thy Sweets to him, and pall'd thy Love! Gods! shall he, tasteless, riot on such Charms! The dull Incumbrance of thy longing Arms! Whilst I, all tender Passion, all Desire, Scarce gain a Look, and that too fans my Fire! When social Hours indulge the genial Feast, What Cares! what Torments rend my tortur'd Breast! That only Time my longing Eyes improve, And starve my Appetite, to feed my Love; Fix'd on that magic Face, I grieve to see Those Smiles bestow'd on him, deny'd to me; But when the Husband-Lover lolls to Rest On the soft Effluence of that snowy Breast; With bleeding Heart, I mourn thy ruffled Charms, And curse the Rudeness of his clumsy Arms; Tho' free, I banquet at a dear Expence, And pay with Griefs the grand Benevolence: With envious Eyes behold each melting Kiss, Pant for the Joy, and languish for the Bliss; Asham'd, enrag'd, I sigh, I fret, I frown, Gnaw my vex'd Lips, and glance obliquely down; But, when thy Eyes with Flames too kindly burn, Melt as his Glance, and ev'ry Glance return; To cool the raging Fever of my Soul, To drown my Cares, I drink the sparkling Bowl; But Wine still kindles up a new Desire, Revives each Flame, re-animates each Fire! How oft I turn aside my jealous Eyes? But Love returns them to some new surprize! Still would I feast on that dear, charming Face, For ever languish, and for ever gaze! But can my injur'd Sight with Patience bear, A heavy, fulsome, Husband-Lover there? In a sweet-tort'ring Look, at once remains, Excess of Pleasures, and Excess of Pains! O that my Conduct could disguise my Care, But Love, that's naked, scorns all Dress to wear; The more suppress'd, the more my Passions rise, Speak in my Looks, and sparkle in my Eyes: Too plain the Secrets of my Soul they shew! And O that they were known to only you! For oft, with Reason too, I felt a Fear, Oft as I breath'd a Sigh, or dropt a Tear, Lest some officious Question should display Your Husband's Care, and all my Love betray: How oft, to hide my too apparent Flame, Have I reveal'd it in a foreign Name? Bewail'd some poor unhappy Lover's Moan, And, in their seeming Sorrows breath'd my own; On thy dear Face, I fix'd my dying Eyes, Wept in his Tears, and languish'd in his Sighs; And if enflam'd too far, I snatch'd a Kiss, Feign'd Drunkenness excus'd the ravish'd Bliss. Once, I remember, as your flowing Vest Disclos'd the naked Wonders of your Breast, How meltingly the snowy Globes arose! Fair, as the Fleeces of descending Snows! Bright as the Down that cloath'd your Parent Jove, When Leda panted with the Thund'rer's Love, Like that their Tenderness, like that their Hue, Soft as those silver Plumes, and heavenly too! Gods! how I stood, transported with Surprize! How heav'd my Bosom, and how flam'd my Eyes! Ravish'd, I drop'd the purple-foamy Bowl, And all the melting God came rushing on my Soul! But mark me, how industriously I strive To feed my Flame, and keep my Love alive! If your dear Lips salute the flowing Wine, Fix'd on the Place, I make the Nectar mine; Ev'n from the Child, the Kiss you give, I take, And love the Daughter for her Mother's sake. Now soft-adapted Songs conspire to move; For Music is the sweetest Voice of Love! Supinely laid, I languish out each Air, And tunefully prefer my dying Prayer. Each Passage to that cruel Heart I've try'd, But Cupid ev'ry Avenue deny'd: Oft to your faithful Maids my Love I've told, And smooth'd my Rhetoric with persuasive Gold; But all I urg'd, alas! I urg'd in vain, Deaf to my Prayers, they leave me to my Pain. O could Heroic Acts my Fair obtain, This Hand, this Heart the noble Prize should gain! Like Atalanta's, could thy Charms be won, I'd leave the swiftest, with the fleetest run; Inspir'd by Love, pursue the flying Chace, And, lifted on his Pinions reach the Race. Could Strength prevail, like Hercules, these Arms Should win a brighter Dejanira's Charms! But O thou dear! un-utterably Fair! Since all my Hopes depend on Sighs and Prayer, By the sweet Splendour of those starry Eyes, Bright, as their Brother-Orbs that gild the Skies! By Jove, whose Throne such Beauties might adorn, Were not thy kindred Charms too nearly born; Unless yourself will grace my glad Return, Here will I doom my fading Life to mourn! At thy dear Feet resign my panting Breath, Adore thee, love thee, bless thee ev'n in Death! O view my throbbing Breast, behold my Pain! Nor let my earnest Passion plead in vain! Ah me! that destin'd Flames consume my Heart, And those bright Eyes confess the heavenly Dart! Cassandra kindly warn'd me of my Fate, But I believ'd her Prophecies too late! Yet, charming Nymph! the Gods Commands fulfil, For Justice bids you cure, as well as kill. More could I say, but rather hope to meet, And breathe my Soul in Transports at your Feet; In some convenient Place, my Passion prove, And dedicate this happy Night to Love. Nor blush, my charming Fair! nor idly dread To violate, or stain the Marriage-Bed; Too innocently nice such Scruples are, To think that Woman can be chaste and fair: Some human Blemishes are no Disgrace, Like Patches, they adorn a beauteous Face: Let your own Mother's kind Example move, Nor dread a Vengeance from a guilty Jove; Sprung from the Transports of a like Embrace, Shall lovely Hellen deviate from her Race? Yet, when we reach the happy Shores of Troy, Marriage shall crown our honourable Joy; Till then, believe me, Fair, to slip this Time, Would be the greater Sin, the greater Crime: For this, the Gods with ev'ry Wish conspire, For this, your Husband seconds our Desire; By their Commands, officiously withdraws, And absent, silently asserts our Cause: By his Example, his own Acts pursue, In leaving him, as he in leaving you: What! could no other Time his Journey fit? Indeed, 'tis very like a Husband's Wit! Poor Soul! he cry'd “Be careful of our Guest,” He said no more, and we may think the rest— But you his very last Commands neglect, A certain Token of a forc'd Respect; To both alike a cold Indifference prove; Both lost alike to Duty and to Love! But could a longing Lover leave you so? Thus easily such tasted Joys forego! No! dull Fruition all his Taste destroys, Nor knows he half the Jewel he enjoys; Else, could he ne'er desert those tempting Charms, At least, resign them to a Rival's Arms! O! let my Love awake his sated Eyes, And teach them each dear Beauty how to prize! Cold, lonesome, in a widow'd Bed you lie, And, languishing in Solitude, I sigh; What Fear, what barring Obstacle remains, But you may wreak your Wrongs, and ease my Pains? Transporting Thought! to riot in those Charms, To clasp those balmy Beauties in my Arms! Imparadis'd in those soft Folds I'll lie, Look such dear things, such sweet Persuasions sigh; With such prevailing Elocution burn, To sooth you with your Paris to return; That sure, if Love has Power, you'll feel my Fire, And in dissolving Murmurs breathe Desire! To vindicate your Honour, and your Fame, On me be all the Rape, on me the Blame; Let Theseus and your Brother's Actions plead, Leaders like these will dignify the Deed; They stole Leucippa's Daughters, Theseus You; And can't his Licence be my Licence too? Already mann'd, my Fleet attends your stay, And the Winds murmur at your long Delay; Inviting Gales, impatient, court the Joy, To waft us to the sacred Shores of Troy: How shall those Charms our gazing Crouds amaze! How speak a Goddess! how confess a Grace! What shining Pomp shall gild the passing Show! What heaping Numbers without Number flow! What Gifts, what Honours shall all Troy decree! Gifts, worthy Priam's Court, and worthy thee! Where'er you turn, what Altars shall arise! What aromatic Incense cloud the Skies! Such Glories wait—with greatness un-exprest, For Praise were there Detraction at the best. Nor think that Greece shall follow with Alarms, Did e'er a Rape excite a Nation's Arms? When Thracia stole the bright Athenian Dame, Did Thracia suffer for the guilty Flame? Did Colchos with resenting Vengeance rise, To snatch from Jason's Arms his beauteous Prize? Safe from the Terrors of invasive War, Theseus enjoy'd at Peace his Cretan Fair. When Theseus snatch'd thy brighter Beauties too, What Vengeance did the Ravisher pursue? Then, trust me, Nymph, 'tis all an empty Fear; Or we may think of Danger, when 'tis near. But should all Grecia's hostile Troops engage, Know, we have Forces to repel their Rage; Like Grecia, we have Armies at Command, As brave our Heroes, and as wide our Land. But if your Husband should Atrides dare; My self will meet his Shock, and stand his War: Tho' young, yet bold in martial Toils of Fame, My early Valour dignify'd my Name; When fir'd with gen'rous Rage I boldly rose, Rescu'd my fleecy Flocks, and slew my Foes: Deïphobus, Illioneus can tell How far my Courage and my Strength excel; Nor does this Arm alone the Javelin throw, But launch the Spear, and arch the moony Bow; With equal Judgment, and with equal Force, Direct the feather'd Fate and urge its Course: Can Menelaus boast Atchievements so? Or, boasting, can he prove his Actions true? But should (what I ne'er think) his Arm prevail, Should Heaven conspire to make your Paris fail; Great Hector could retrieve that Glory lost, Hector, our Bulwark! in himself an Host! O! did you know to what deserving Arms, The bounteous Gods ordain those heavenly Charms! May, then this certain Oath my Passion prove, Confirm your Courage, and inflame your Love; That hostile Greece shall never cross the Main, Or, baffled by this Arm, return again: Fir'd by those Eyes, I'd singly meet a War, Confront each Fury, and each Danger dare! While future Fame should glory in your Charms, And boast how Hellen set the World in Arms! But haste, my Fair! the Gales their Aid employ, And Fate has fix'd your Happiness in Troy. Penelope to Ulysses. The Argument. Hellen's Rape having drawn all the Grecian Princes to the Siege of Troy; among the rest, Ulysses on this Occasion distinguished himself in a very remarkable manner. But he not returning to Penelope, after the Siege was over, she remands him by this Epistle, having behaved as well at home, by her Chastity, as he had done at Troy by his Valour. She recites the various Addresses of her Suitors, and pathetically bewails his Stay; acquainting him at the same time with the misconduct of his Family-Affairs, thro' his Absence, and earnestly presses his speedy return, in order to their Regulation. These Lines, my Lord, your cruel Absence mourn; O! let your Answer be your quick Return: Sure Troy, the fatal Fountain of our Woe! Has felt her finish'd Ruin long ago! But not all Troy restor'd could e'er repay The Griefs I suffer by your long Delay. Had Paris, when he sought the Spartan Dame, Sunk in the Seas, and quench'd his lawless Flame! Those sad Anxieties I ne'er had known, Nor sigh'd out solitary Nights alone! With widow'd Hands engag'd the daily Toil, Nor slumb'ring sought my Sorrows to beguile! But slumb'ring, still alas, in vain I strove; Clos'd were my Eyes by Sleep, but ope'd by Love! In Dreams, at visionary Scenes I swoon'd, Shrunk at each Stroke, and felt each fancy'd Wound; Beheld my daring Lord in loud Alarms, And Fate and Hector rushing on his Arms! Shock'd at the Sight, and shiv'ring with cold Fear, Confus'd I wak'd, and breath'd a pious Prayer. When some Report, descriptive of the Fight, Reviv'd the recent Horrours of the Night; Wak'd at each Tale my boding Dreams return'd, And all my Fears as real Ills I mourn'd. Griev'd, I deplor'd Patroclus, wise too late! His borrow'd Glory, his lamented Fate! With Tears I heard Tlepolemus, o'erthrown, And made the Warrior's Miseries my own. But if some Grecian Brave-Unknown were kill'd, Ulysses thro' my trembling Pulses thrill'd; My pallid Looks confess'd the widow'd-Wife, And my Soul panted for my Hero's Life! But blest be ev'ry Love-indulgent Power? For now those Fears, with Ilium are no more: Rich in her Spoils, our conqu'ring Chiefs return, And to our Gods their grateful Off'rings burn: With joyful Pride relate the Trojan War, And dwell on ev'ry honourable Scar. On her lov'd Lord each longing Lady lies, Views the dear Man, and at his Glory sighs; With sweetly-smiling Looks delights to trace The dawning Features of the former Face: Immortal Acts the list'ning Crouds engage, Boastings for Youth! and future Tales for Age! While some, less eloquent, their Toils design, Figure each Fight, and miniature each Scene: In purple Wines each purple River pours, And, dy'd with mimic Blood, Scamander roars: Here fam'd Sigeum's tow'ry Tops arise, There Priam's cloudy Turrets pierce the Skies; Here, stretch'd around, the tented Shores display, Where great Ulysses and Achilles lay: Here, thund'ring Hector bursts the Grecian Walls, There storms in Triumph, there, a Triumph falls. From Nestor's Lips your Son imbib'd your Fame, And all your Glory all his Soul inflame; Pleas'd, he relates that memorable Night, And dwells on ev'ry Horror with Delight: But could my Hero so forgetful prove, So quick to Dangers! and so deaf to Love! When thro' the Gloom you sought the hostile Host, And all the Lover in the Hero lost; With only one Companion of your Toils, What Tents destroy'd! how made those Tents your Spoils! As from their Stalls the Thracian Steeds you drew, How might some swift-revenging Hand pursue! Rescue the proud triumphant Prize you sought, And snatch your Life, that richer Prize you brought! Could then your Heaps of Spoils, your Hills of Slain, Sooth my sad Soul, or mitigate my Pain! But yet, tho' safe from all those fierce Alarms, You live not, if you live not in these Arms! Ah what avail the Deeds Reports declare, Unless you reap the mighty Honours here! While others bless their happy Hopes compleat, Their Joys deriving from Troy's finish'd Fate; Widow'd, I seek in vain for kind Relief, And Troy, my former Terror, is my Grief! Her ruin'd Streets enrich'd with human Gore, Now teem with Corn, that teem'd with Men before: Her once-rich Domes with richer Harvests flow, But yield, as still, to me the Fruit of Woe! From ev'ry Stranger that invades our Coast, With Tears I ask my wand'ring Lover lost; To his kind Care my Letter'd-Griefs commit, And pray that pitying Heaven may make ye meet. At Pylos I my doubtful Chief explor'd; But Pylos told no Tidings of my Lord: To Sparta's Realms my speedy Message went, But Sparta's Realms uncertain Answers sent. O! still had Troy maintain'd her bright Abodes, Nor felt the Fury of her hostile Gods; Exempt from this Variety of Care, I'ad known no Dangers, but the Chance of War; But now what sad Anxieties inclose! What real, what imaginary Woes! What Horrors my distemper'd Fancy fill! What Fears I frame! how ev'ry Fear I feel! From Rocks, from raging Seas what Scenes I feign! Wild as the Rocks, and boundless as the Main: Oft fear, averse to these domestic Charms, You lull your Honour in some Stranger's Arms; To please her Pride describe your homely Wife, And bant'ring ridicule a virtuous Life! But soon my Love dispels those Fears away; And on the Gods I charge your long Delay. My urgent Sire, lest Sorrows should consume The youthful Beauties of my vernal Bloom, With Pray'rs engag'd my Heart again to wed, And taste the Pleasures of a second Bed; But not my Sire could move my Soul's Decree, Still was I thine, and thine will ever be! Now conscious of my pure, unspotted Flame, Himself he censures, and applauds my Name. Yet where e'en Duty, and his Will could fail, Audacious Lovers labour to prevail: Their Suit the Samians, the Dulichians move, With all the flatt'ring Fopperies of Love; In noisy Crouds intrude, unbidden Guests! Carouse our Banquets, riot on our Feasts. In wanton Luxuries our Stores decay, And all, but Love, becomes an easy Prey! Pisander, Polybus, and Medon too, With num'rous others, join the lawless Crew. Why should I each detested Name repeat? Spunge to our Wealth! and Canker to our State! Rude by Reproof, and insolently bold, Unaw'd they revel, triumph if controul'd. Alas! what Force of ours can end the Strife? A feeble Father, and a widow'd Wife! Your tender Son, unbred to fierce Alarms, Implores his Sire to lead his Soul to Arms. As lost, of late, the duteous Youth I mourn'd; Bent on your Search, to find his Hopes return'd. But may kind Heaven its choicest Blessings shed, From Harms protect his dear devoted Head; His Fame for-ever guard, for-ever raise, To crown the peaceful Ev'ning of our Days! But who shall now our injur'd Right maintain, Controul Offenders, and assert our Reign? Decay'd, your Father scarcely dares command; Tho' wise his Counsels, wither'd is his Hand! What can my helpless, tender Nature shew? A Woman only, and a soft one too! Unhappy We! whose Weakness is our Power! I'll weep! I'll sigh! but I can do no more— Let Sighs, and Tears your quick Return engage, To guide your Son, and guard your Father's Age, From Life's last Verge conduct him gently down, And teach the Youth to soar to high Renown! Then haste! lest as I weep for your Return, Too late, like me, my fading Charms you mourn. Ariadne to Theseus. The Argument. The Athenians having basely killed Androgeos the Son of Minus King of Crete; that Prince, by a severe War, compelled them to send annually seven Batchelors and as many Virgins to be devoured by the Minotaure. This was a Monster engendered by a Bull upon Pasiphae, the Wife of Minus, while he was engaged in the Athenian Wars. Among others, the Lot fell upon Theseus to be one of these destined Youths, but he encountered and killed the Monster, and afterwards by the direction of Ariadne made his escape out of the Labyrinth, and fled with her, to the Isle of Naxos. Afterwards, upon a Summons from Bacchus, he left her one Morning when asleep: she finding her self thus deserted, sends him this Epistle. From that inhuman Shore these Lines receive, Where late you left a tender Nymph to grieve; Tho' there expos'd to savage Beasts of Prey, She lives to call thee savager than they: Their Cruelties no more than Nature prove; But Theseus hid his Cruelties in Love, When Sleep, and his endearing Arms betray'd A drowzy, easy, miserable Maid! Scarce had the tuneful Birds awak'd the Day, And the Dew glitter'd at each dawning Ray; When melting in soft Dreams, my Arms I threw, To clasp my Joys, and circle them in you; But as I stretching turn'd me to your Place, An empty Grasp receiv'd my warm Embrace; Turning, again I reach'd, I search'd again; I lookt, I felt; but lookt, or felt in vain: Wak'd in a Fright, I started from the Bed, And as I fear'd, I found my Swain was fled. At this I beat my Breast, I tore my Hair, And stood a-while the Image of Despair. Led by the Lustre of the waning Moon, From Place to Place distractedly I run; By her pale Rays, not half so pale as I, Dimly the solitary Land espy; With widow'd Eyes survey the mournful View, But all, like me, seem'd destitute of you: Theseus! along the concave Shores I cry'd; Theseus! the repercussive Shores reply'd: The Shores, tho' deaf to Storms, more kind than you, Heard ev'ry Call, and echoing call'd you too. Rais'd on the Margin of the thirsty Sands, A rough, a barren Promontory stands; Advent'rous by Despair, the Top I climb, For Passion gave a Pinion to each Limb: Thence, the wide Seas, and subject Floods survey, And o'er the blue Expansion roll my Eye; When strait I saw thy distant Streamers blow, Float on the Breeze, and o'er the Billows flow. Amaz'd, at first I doubted my Surprize, And Reason held a Conflict with my Eyes: But soon (too soon!) I found the Terror true, Nor did my wond'ring Eyes deceive, but you! Then, in what Agony of Thought I stood! How chill'd my Bosom! and how freez'd my Blood! 'Till o'er my speechless Rage, my Grief prevail'd, Unloos'd my frigid Tongue, and loud I call'd! O Theseus! Theseus! whither do you fly? Return—'tis Ariadne calls! I die— At ev'ry Call I beat my panting Breast, And where my Accents fail'd, my Rage exprest: From my cold Limbs my parting Vest I tore; And high in Air the waving Signal bore. In vain! my Breath but made you faster fly, Nor would you see the Sign, nor hear the Cry. But when my Sight no farther could pursue, And intervening Oceans dimm'd my View: Till then restrain'd, my Tears in Torrents flow'd, Stream'd down my Eyes, and all the Woman show'd: My Eyes! their only Office, let them weep; And mourn the Theseus, that they could not keep. Now like some frantic Bacchanal I fly, Now bath'd in Grief, on some bleak Mountain lie, From thence the solitary Seas explore, See the Waves rise, and hear the Billows roar; Cold as the Flinty-Rock, there sit alone, And seem a Piece just growing from the Stone. Oft to the conscious Grotto I return, Sigh o'er my Grief, and o'er thy Absence mourn: There, as some Transport to my Soul appears, Kindles my Breast, and melts my Heart in Tears; Falling I press thy dear, deserted Place, And breathe my Sorrows on the briny Grass; To the sad Shades in plaintive Accents cry, O cruel! could you let my Theseus fly? I brought my Theseus hither true, and kind, Sure 'tis your baneful Influence chang'd his Mind! Ye Shades, ye Shades, my gentle Swain restore, True, as at first; and tender, as before. What shall I do! or whither can I fly? What Succour, what Inhabitant is nigh? No human Race possess the savage Isle, No rising Harvests on the Peasants smile; No Trade the barren Wilderness supplies, Girt with rough Seas, and bound with barren Skies. But should some favourable Ship appear, Moor on these Shores, and wait my Passage here, To what far unknown Region should I roam? Where seek a Shelter? and where find a Home? No Cretan Cities will Protection give, Nor can my Friends, my injur'd Friends! forgive. To you, false Man, my Father I betray'd; And Heaven has justly now the Crime repaid! To gain your Love, your wand'ring Steps I sped, And thro' the Labyrinth too kindly led; But when I first the active Present bore, What Words! what Vows! what Promises you swore! By this dear Gift, you cry'd, this magic Clue, Which thus for ever binds my Heart to you! To your last Breath my faithful Love I swear, Firm be my Oath, as Ariadne's dear. False Man, I live, (if one like me can live) To see your Love, your Promises, deceive! O! had you me with my poor Brother slain, Then had your Vows been void, and void my Pain. But, whilst I these experienc'd Griefs relate, Blind to my future Griefs, reserv'd by Fate; What fictious Horrors all my Thoughts controul, Rise on my Sight, and sink upon my Soul! In ev'ry Breeze some ranging Beast I hear, And start at Phantoms conjur'd by my fear: Imagine Lions in the Oceans roar, And fabled Monsters rising from the Shore: See murd'ring Ruffians' bloody Daggers rise, Gild the green Gloom, and glimmer in my Eyes; Faint, scarce I move, pant with thick-beating Breath, And my Soul suffers with ideal Death: Fearful some servile Slavery to prove, Below my Lineage, and below thy Love. Where-e'er I turn my Sight, where-e'er I go, Fresh Scenes of Horror multiply my Woe; As o'er the desart Rocks my Eyes I roll, There view the gloomy Image of my Soul: On the wide Seas with black'ning Tempests fill'd, Survey my troubled Breast with Sorrows swell'd. Nor in my deepest Anguish scarcely dare Breathe a sad Sigh to Heaven, or steal a Prayer; For would the list'ning Gods relieve my Pain, Those Gods that ev'n have chang'd my faithless Swain! Those cruel Gods that leave me thus a Prey To savage Beasts, or Man more fierce than they! O that my Brother's Blood had ne'er been spilt, Nor Athens paid so dearly for the Guilt! O that by thee the Monster ne'er had dy'd! Nor this fond Hand the ductive Clue supply'd! Thro' the blind Maze I taught thy Steps to rove, But lost myself in Labyrinths of Love! Nor do I wonder that you conquer'd so, Yourself the greater Monster of the two! Steel'd with that Savageness you dar'd the War, And fac'd a Danger that you could not fear: Well might that Breast the horned Combate try, Whose Powers the sharper Darts of Love defy. Ye treach'rous Slumbers, that deceiv'd my Joys, O close again, for ever! close these Eyes: Robb'd of my Bliss, in vain you bring Relief, Unless, as you begun, you end my Grief. Ye faithless Gales, that bore my Love away, No more in sportive Zephirs idly play; But charg'd with Griefs in deeper Murmurs blow, Sigh out my Sighs, and whisper out my Woe, And thou, false Theseus, listless of my Cries, Could not a Brother's Death thy Rage suffice! By diff'rent Means you act an equal Wrong, He felt your Sword, and I that flatt'ring Tongue; That Tongue that first my easy Heart betray'd, Till Sleep, and rising Gales conspir'd their Aid; Conspir'd, like silly me, a Swain to please, Like that, too soothing, faithless too like these! Must then alas! these widow'd Eyes no more Survey the Confines of my Native Shore! But daily fading in a foreign Land Expire, without a Parent's closing Hand! Shall no dear heart-dissolving Friend be near, To sooth my Sorrows with a tender Tear! Shall no religious Rites be kindly paid! No Comfort dying! and no Guard when dead! But must my Body un-inhum'd decay, Alike, when living, and when dead, a Prey. While You at Athens seek a glorious name! To reap the mighty Harvest of your Fame; Describe the Monster-Man, the Conquest blaze; And traverse o'er again the winding-Maze: How great 'twill sound, to name a certain Maid, That crown'd your Arms deserted! and betray'd! But cruel as the Rocks that brought thee forth, (For I can ne'er believe thy boasted Birth) Would some kind Power my Spectre-Figure show, 'Twould touch thy Soul with sympathetic Woe! But since the distance such a Sight denies, O see my Sorrows by Idea rise. Think then, you see a Mountain's batter'd Brow, Beat by rough Winds, and stunn'd by Floods below; On some deep-bellying Crag behold me there, My Locks dishevel'd, and my Bosom bare. Behold me on the clammy Stone reclin'd, Like rainy Harvests bending with the Wind; While o'er the dewy Sheets I breathe my Pain, Drench'd in my Tears, and spatter'd by the Main. “Theseus relent, and if at your Return, “You find me dead—O Theseus close my Urn. Dido to Æneas. The Argument. Æneas, at the Destruction of Troy, having saved his Houshold-Gods; his Father, and his Son Ascanius from the Flames; set Sail with twenty Vessels, and was at length shipwrecked on the Lybian Shore. Where Dido, secreting herself from her Brother Pygmalion's Cruelty (who had murdered Sichæus her Husband) built the City of Carthage. Æneas and his Fleet were very hospitably Entertained, and the Queen fell passionately in Love with him, and compleated her Wishes by Enjoyment. But Æneas in a Dream being admonished by Mercury to go in quest of the Kingdom of Italy, long before promised him by the Gods, he readily prepares for the Expedition. Dido soon alarmed thereat tries all Arts to dissuade him from his intended Enterprize, which proving fruitless, she at last, in Despair, sends him this Epistle. Thus some expiring Swan bewails her Woe, While with the Streams her Strains in Anguish flow: Nor think I these, that Heart so hard, can move, Shall Sorrow stronger than my Passion prove! When Love, when Honour, and when Int'rest fail, Can a weak Woman's soft Complaints prevail: These all were yours, but are not worth your Care, Alas you leave the Giver to despair; With ardent Wishes court the rising Gales, False as your Oaths, and flatt'ring as your Tales; While now the Ships their swelling Wings display, To bear your Vows, with all my Hopes away! Led by delusive Thoughts of Fame to come, Perhaps the Fates but tempt you out to roam; But if a future Empire fire your Mind, Think of this Empire which you leave behind. To crown that Wish the proffer'd Gift receive, With all a Lover and a Queen can give. Suppose you reach this foreign unknown Shore, Safe from the dang'rous Ocean's stormy Roar, What Friend, what Subject shall your way prepare, Or who commit on trust the regal Care? What Stratagems, what Methods will you prove? All are not easy Nymphs betray'd by Love! Nor will your Cities on a sudden rise To vie with Carthage, and invade the Skies: But can propitious Fortune e'er bestow A Nymph like Dido, kind, like Dido, true? That you, like wretched Dido, may undo! Alas my tender Heart! I burn, I burn! Like Tapers dying o'er some holy Urn. Æneas all my tortur'd Breast employs, Streams in my Tears, and sparkles in my Joys: For ever in my Sight his Image seems, Charms when awake, and melts me in my Dreams. Yet whilst the lovely Tyrant mocks my Pain, How often do I curse the cold Disdain? But soon, for still his pleading Eyes are by, Revoke the Curse, and give my Tongue the Lye. O Venus! kindly sooth a bleeding Heart, O Cupid! pierce him with an equal Dart. Thy Shafts the very Deities controul, Shall they then fail to reach a Mortal's Soul! O teach me how this Passion to resign, Or touch his Bosom with a Flame like mine. False-hearted Man, no more thy Fates deceive, Which breathing Vows enforc'd me to believe; No tender Goddess could thy Parent prove! At least the Goddess, and the Queen of Love: 'Twas Pride that forg'd the vain delusive Lye, For thou hast nought of Love but Perjury. From savage Rocks, or treach'rous Seas you sprung, Where Sirens tun'd that false bewitching Tongue: From that inhuman Stock your Nature drew Hardness, Inconstancy, and Coldness too. But whither, cruel Wand'rer, would you run? What Dangers tempt, my injur'd Sight to shun? Tho' deaf as Rocks the raging Sea deforms, Tho' fickle as the Winds that drive the Storms; Think on your perjur'd Faith, and O refrain! Nor tempt the Dangers of the stormy Main. Behold the swelling Waves obstruct your way, Kindly they form Excuses for Delay; Shall the rough Winds, and Billows prove more true, More soft, more tender, and more kind than you? If thus to wrong my Love you tempt your Fate, Disdain you'll purchase at too dear a rate! But if you'ad rather wander o'er the Deep, Than in these longing Arms be lull'd asleep; May Heaven indulgent yet a while reserve, The fatal Vengeance you so well deserve. Nor into Perils thus so rashly fly, But wait the Promise of a kinder Sky; Strait shall the Winds be chang'd, the Storms blown o'er, And gentler Breezes court thee from the Shore: While, if my Wishes, and my Hopes are true, Some God may work an equal Change in you. But would you thus a fresh Experience gain, Thus by repeated hazard prove the Main; O think what latent Dangers fill the Deep, Tho' Winds lie hush'd, tho' Billows lull'd asleep; The treach'rous Waves some Vengeance may conceive, May, like that false deluding Face, deceive. And should some low'ring Storm involve the Skies, What violated Power would hear your Cries? Would Venus, tho' your Parent, guard her Foes, Her Power controuls the Seas from whence it rose. Not that I wish this fatal Judgment near! I only caution, what I kindly fear; Tho' led by thee, abandon'd, and betray'd, Methinks I could not see thee thus repaid: O rather live, to save that perjur'd Breath, Be false, be cruel, triumph in my Death. But think you hear the angry Billows roll, (Good Heaven avert the Omen of my Soul) Think then what Scenes of Horror will ensue, Rise in your Mind, and open to your View: When Dido, whom, you'll pity then too late! Shall rise the bloody Witness of her Fate; Repeat those tender Perjuries you said, And point for Vengeance on the Wounds you made. Confounded by Despair, with Guilt oppress'd, You'll feel a fiercer Tempest in your Breast: In the sad Anguish of Affliction call, “'Tis just ye Gods, my Crimes deserve it all. Each Moment some impending Judgment dread, And think the Thunder levell'd at your Head. If Dangers and Persuasions fail to move, Let your own Care a stronger Motive prove; I'll not receive the Kindness, as my Boon, I'll call it tender Pity to a Son: Think on his blooming Years, nor trust his Life, 'Tis Crime enough to wrong an injur'd Wife. Think then upon those Deities you bear, Nor late their dread Divinity revere; You, that redeem'd them from the Flames of Troy, Shall you by a worse Fate their Powers destroy! But neither Gods, nor Mortals you regard, No Pity ever touch'd a Heart so hard; Those Shoulders ne'er reliev'd a Sire oppress'd, Rather thy Crimes sat heavy on his Breast. False as thy self, 'tis all an empty Cheat; Nor have I first experienc'd thy Deceit. Like me, Creüsa thy fond Tales believ'd, Like me deserted, and like me deceiv'd! How have I made her Miseries my own, Which now alas too fatally are one! For this with Vengeance arm'd the Gods pursue, To give your perjur'd Villainies their due; For this, for seven long Years they made you roam A vagrant Wretch, unworthy of a Home. Driv'n on my Coast, you su'd a suppliant Guest, Undone by Fortune, and by Storms oppress'd; Mov'd by your Wants, I melted at your Grief, And sooth'd your pleading Sorrows with Relief. I gave alas!—what gave I not to you? My Crown, my Kingdom, and my Honour too! And is it thus my Kindness you reward! And is it thus my Pity you regard! Ungen'rous! can you so forgetful prove, So lost alike to Gratitude and Love! But curst for ever be the fatal Day, When in the conscious, shelt'ring Shade we lay: Alas how dear did that Protection cost! For that my Honour, and my Fame I lost! With what presaging Howls the Furies yell'd? What Ululations all the Vallies fill'd? E'en Nature labour'd to divert my Fate; But I the doubtful Signals learn'd too late! Tormenting Anguish! self-accusing Thought! What have I done! O whither am I brought! Reflecting, from my self in vain I fly; Asham'd to live, and yet afraid to die! Can my dear Lord this spotted Soul receive? Or will his injur'd Ghost my Guilt forgive? Last Night his Statue in the gloomy Grove, A pious Token of my chaster Love; With Chaplets, and with verdant Foliage dress'd, To me these deep prophetick Words express'd; “Come Dido,—thrice the hollow Echo spoke, Trembling I heard it thrice, and thrice I shook. I come dear injur'd Shade—but sadly slow, Loaded with Shame, and overcharg'd with Woe. O can you pardon me! indeed his Charms Would melt the coldest Virtue in his Arms; His heavenly Birth, and his more heavenly Eyes, So strongly, so unwarily surprize! Such Looks, such Words would make all Hearts believe It was not in his Nature to deceive: But if his dear enchanting Wiles you knew, My Wrongs you'd wave, and wish the Charmer true. And were he such, I'd glory in my Shame, Excess like that would justify my Flame! Too truly I my rigid Fortune know, Destin'd to Sorrow, and inur'd to Woe! Slain at the Shrine my much lamented Lord, Fell a sad Victim to my Brother's Sword: Oppress'd, the Blood-polluted Land I left, By Foes pursu'd, and of my Friends bereft. Here fled, here built this City which you see, And dearly purchas'd what I give to thee; With those wide Lands that stretch along the Shore, Far as the misty Prospect can explore. With grudging Hearts my Neighbours saw me rise, And view'd my Glories with malignant Eyes. Lur'd by my Wealth, pretending Courtiers came, And hid the Traytor in the Suiter's Name: Who soon when you are gone, by force may storm, And show th' Usurper in his proper Form; While I defenceless, seek in vain a Friend, My Self to succour, and my Right defend. But first O bind these Arms, your Bonds will prove, More easy and more gentle than your Love: To my curst Brother's Sword my Life consign, A Victim to my murder'd Husband's Shrine. Far off the Object of your Hate convey, To scorn'd Hyarbas send the Captive Prey: Then go to foreign Lands, your Deeds relate, And nobly triumph in a Woman's Fate; But wisely first from Sacrilege refrain, Nor with polluting Hands your Gods prophane; Your Gods from ev'ry Touch may suffer more, Than e'er they fear'd from Trojan Flames before. But you perhaps have left me e'er you go, Some miserable Legacy of Woe; Time soon may see the Token of our Flame, Blush into Life, and kindle into Shame; Then sure my Death must melt that savage Heart, At least you'll suffer for your tender Part. But with a Credit to deceive, you say, A God excites, and blames your long Delay: O had that cruel Deity before Preserv'd your Fortunes, and preserv'd my Shore! Does then this tutelary Power again Direct your Voyage thro' the pathless Main? What Scenes of Sorrows next compleat your Woes? What unattempted Dangers must oppose! Dangers, which Troy, restor'd to all her State, Could never purchase at an equal Rate: Yet you imaginary Lands pursue, And with chimeric Kingdoms feast your View: In unknown Latium Empires are design'd, And Tiber's Streams run ever in your Mind. But 'tis Variety you long to prove; Fickle alike in Fortune, and in Love. Can Crowns or Scepters Satisfaction give; This Crown a Token of my Flame receive: My subject Kingdom at your Feet I'll lay, With all Obedience which a Queen can pay: To Lybian Lands consign your spreading Fame, And raise new Ilium by a happier Name. But if you scorn the gentle Arts of Peace, And in mere quest of Dangers search the Seas; Bestow that Courage on my Country's Foes, For fierce Invaders every Side inclose. Here let Ascanius with your Arms controul, Live o'er his Sire, and copy all his Soul; Encreasing Fame diffuse to foreign Shores, And shade with conqu'ring Wreaths our softer Hours. But, by those kindred Deities you boast, By those you rev'rence, those you honour most: By all that ever could your Wishes move, Command your Pity, or reward your Love; So may your Son adorn your Age with Joy, And all the Father crown the blooming Boy; So may your Parents Ashes rest in Ease, So may your Soul with his be blest with Peace. O hear! O listen to my dying Prayer, Nor plunge a wretched Abject in Despair! What have I done, that thus you leave me so, In what have I declar'd my self your Foe? Did I, or mine, our hostile Arms employ, And with the Grecians urge the Fate of Troy? No! no! from Love, not Hatred flows my Ill, And what afflicts me, I must love you still! Perhaps the Thoughts of stale domestic Charms, Bar from my Breast that Heaven in your Arms: If so, all specious Titles I'll resign, Be what you will! so I may make you mine. Grant but your Love, I beg no nuptial Tie, For Love is Life, is Honour, all to Me! Yet if this dear Petition be too great, One momentary Favour I intreat: While thus descending Tempests toss the Sea, And swelling Billows stop the watry Way; With Patience wait, and prudently prepare Your Crew to strengthen, and your Ships repair. Nor on a sudden leave my Soul accurst, But softly sooth it into Patience first; Administer some gentle, kind Relief, And teach me by degrees to bear my Grief. Then, if your Resolutions must prevail, And all my Tears, and all my Prayers must fail; Soon shall the Storms in whisp'ring Gales expire, And the calm Ocean with your Wish conspire. But if inexorable you remain Deaf to my Griefs, and careless of my Pain; Think that you ne'er shall triumph long, for know, This Hand can put a Period to my Woe. This Sword, your fatal Gift, the Task can do; Sure it can kill, because it came from you: Close in my Lap the thirsty Weapon lies, Bath'd with the briny Torrents of my Eyes: Which, if I fail, my Passion to redeem, Shall turn the crystal to a crimson Stream. From my torn Breast the rooted Pain remove, And there conclude the Wound began by Love. And thou, dear Anna! conscious of my Woe, This last kind Office to a Sister show: With pious Care my breathless Bones inhume, Shed some soft Sorrow, and erect a Tomb. Nor there Sichæus, as my Consort, name, Alas that Title will disgrace his Fame! But let the partial Monument relate, This sad, this melancholy Tale of Fate: “Unhappy Dido lies beneath this Stone, “By false Æneas, and his Vows undone; “True to her Love, tho' scorn'd; deceiv'd, she dy'd; “He gave the Sword; her Hand the Sword apply'd. Leander to Hero, Priestess of the Temple of Venus Upon his being by Tempests, prevented from paying his nightly Visits to Her, by swimming over the Hellespontic Sea. That Health Leander to his Hero sends, Himself would bring, were Winds and Seas his Friends. If the kind Gods my constant Passion speed, These Lines my Charmer with Regret must read. But sure I fear, the cruel Deities Conspire against me with the Winds and Seas; Assiduous Prayers are offer'd up in vain, Waves choak my Passage o'er the stormy Main. See! what a pitchy Gloom involves the Sky, How fiery red the nimble Light'nings fly: Scarce any Vessel will the Danger prove, Of high-swoll'n Billows, and of angry Jove. One only ventures from the Shore to part; Fraught with the Wishes of my bleeding Heart; O may propitious Love conduct her way, Swift as his Shafts, unerring too as they. I would have climb'd the happy Vessel's Side, But all Abydos then my Love had spy'd, Which I so long conceal'd in deep Disguise From all the World, and from my Parents Eyes. This when I wrote, with murm'ring Sighs I said, Go, faithful Paper, to the lovely Maid, Feel the soft Touches of her beauteous Hands, (Thy Master envies thee such sweet Commands) As with her Iv'ry Teeth she strives to break Thy slender Chains, close by her glowing Cheek: Enjoy the Bliss of every breathing Gale, And Fragrance, which her rosy Lips exhale. These are the Dictates of an am'rous Heart, To senseless Paper which my Hands impart: But O! how much more willing would they sweep, The level Surface of the long-known Deep! Seven Nights are past, to me a tedious Year; Since howling Tempests stun my tortur'd Ear: If during these, soft Sleep has seal'd my Eyes, Mourning to see the low'ring Morns arise, Kept by the Dangers of the furious Main, May I no more thy dearest Sight regain. Sometimes upon a rugged Rock reclin'd, I strive to sooth my melancholy Mind; With earnest Look, and ardent Thought pursue The distant, dear, forbidden Shore in View: Swifter than Light, Imagination flies, And gains what intervening Space denies. As o'er the lonely Rocks, and Shelves I gaze, Methought I saw thy watchful Taper blaze. Thrice I depos'd my Garments on the Sand, Thrice plunging in the Deep, forsook the Land. The surging Waves my youthful Blows repell'd, Beat on my Temples, and my Fury quell'd. But O! thou Chief of all the swelling Tribe, What mighty Treasure could thy Malice bribe, To thwart my Will? against unhappy me Thy Spite is vented, rather than the Sea. Cold tho' thou art, thy chilly frozen Veins, Thaw'd by warm Love, have thrill'd with am'rous Pains. How hadst thou bluster'd, if some pious Aid Had stopt thy Passage to the ravish'd Maid? Taught by thy self then, Boreas, learn to spare My sick'ning Hopes, and hear a Lover's Prayer; Deaf to my Prayers, regardless of my Moan, Boreas re-murmurs in a louder Tone. O! had I, Dædalus, thy daring Wings, Scorning the Danger which Ambition brings, Soaring aloft, I'd skim the buxom Air, And fly to the Embraces of my Fair. This too's deny'd; then let me for a while With sadly-sweet amusing Thoughts beguile The tedious Time, recall those fleeting Hours Of killing Extasy, that once were ours. Forth from my Father's House I stole alone, As Night slow-mounting up her Ebon-Throne, Began her twinkling Glories to display, And to the Shore unheeded took my way: Then threw my Garments with my Fear aside, And plunging, buffeted the sturdy Tide. The friendly Moon with kind officious Beams, Silver'd the Surface of the trembling Streams; Yet ever and anon she seem'd to shrowd Her fading Lustre in a fleecy Cloud. Then I; Fair Goddess of the silent Night, Bereave me not of thy auspicious Light; Mindful of young Endymion's bloomy Charms, Conduct me safely to my Hero's Arms. You, tho' a Deity, forsook the Skies, Lur'd by the Magick of a Mortal's Eyes: A Goddess is the Object of my Care, Her Form, her Mind, her All, Divinity declare! Her Charms to none the Preference resign, But to the Paphian Queen's, or Cynthia, thine. As all the Stars in yonder azure Field, To thy serene superior Brightness yield, So do the fairest Nymphs with Envy die, And fade when near the Lustre of her Eye. This swimming softly to my self I spoke; The yielding Waves divide at ev'ry Stroke. The glassy Plain reflects the quiv'ring Ray, And the Skies brighten with a fainter Day. Scarce any slumb'ring Breeze was heard to breathe, Or sound, but of the bubbling Stream beneath. Halcyons alone their hapless Fate deplore, Moaning along the melancholy Shore. And now with vent'rous swimming almost sped, High from the Main erect I rais'd my Head: But with what Transport spy'd I from afar, The ruddy Gleamings of my better Star: Within, I said, a brighter yet remains, Source of my Joys, and End of all my Pains. Sudden my Sinews reassum'd their Force, And with fresh Vigour I pursu'd my Course. Too weak Old Ocean's confluent Waters prove, To quench the Flames of my resistless Love. Near and more near the Land advances still, But lags too slow for my fond eager Will. Now, now I view the Queen of my Desire, And all my raging Passions are on fire. Laodamia to Protesilaus When he lay Wind bound at Aulis, on board the Grecian Fleet, designed against Troy. The Winds expiring in a softer Breeze, Swell'd the stretch'd Sails, and smooth'd the peaceful Seas. When, o'er the Waves, in Thought thy Course I sped, Whilst on thy Eyes my famish'd Eyes were fed: Nor could my Eyes the lovely Scene detain, Dimm'd by my Tears, and dizzy by the Main. But lost to those thy flutt'ring Sails pursue, Thy flutt'ring Sails still less'ning to my View, Float o'er the blewy Surge, and seem to wave Adieu. Now bent beneath a Weight of Woe I stood, With Eyes still fixing on the Desart Flood, Till froze with agonizing Pains I swoon'd, And Grief suffus'd a Night of Shades around. Near was I lost to ev'ry healing Power, And scarce my Friends my fleeting Soul restore. Kind tho' their Care, yet kind alas in vain, Me they reviv'd, but ah! reviv'd to Pain. With Life's new Tides, new Tides of Sorrow flow, Grief melts my Soul, and Love dissolves to Woe. New Scenes of Sorrows to my Soul appear, Hear in each Sigh, and stream in ev'ry Tear. No more my Dress reveals the easy Fair, But, like my self, neglected, suits my Care. No Flower-wrought Robes my tender Limbs infold, Shaded with Dyes or interwove with Gold: No more my Locks with starry Gems imprest, Soft-waving, flow adown my rising Breast: But frantick as some Bacchanal, I go, Alike in Figure, and alike in Woe. In vain the fair Physicians sunk in ease, With Female Airs my Soul distracted teaze; Arise, they cry, reject these Words of Care, Dress and be gay; for so becomes the Fair: And let the costly Pomp of Dress delight; Whilst thou in Arms, sustain'st the Toils of Fight. Shall purple Robes these careless Limbs invest, And the rough Buckler brace thy tortur'd Breast? Shall my loose Locks diffusive Odors shed, And the big Helmet load my Warrior's Head? LAURA: OR, THE MISTRESS. Petrarch and Pattison invoke one Name, And both by Laura gain immortal Fame. AN EPISTLE TO LAURA. To you, dear Object of my first Desires, And only Partner of my softest Fires: In artless Eloquence these Lines I send, And let my Love each lowly Verse commend. Nor scorn these Numbers, tho' too sadly slow, Alas! they labour with a Weight of Woe! The Sibyl of the Godhead dispossess'd, Speechless, no more the Prophetess confess'd: The Muse bereft of your inspiring Eyes, Neglected, now her wonted Aid denies; From you alone her Harmony she drew, Nor ever charm'd, unless she charm'd by you. What can I tell you new! You know I love, For that long since is register'd above. But when I think on that amazing Art, That could so easily engage my Heart: I dread I know not what—but O my Dear! Kindly forgive your Swain the fondling Fear, This Heart as easily you may despise, And scorn so mean a Conquest of your Eyes. For Fancy often hears new Lovers sigh, And prostrate sees adoring Vassals die: But now to chace the Image of Despair, Kindly she whispers Comfort in my Ear. Then Heavens! what rising Raptures fill my Soul! How brisk the Tides of Life around me roll! Reviving Pleasures dance in ev'ry Vein, I love, I languish, and I live again. But ah! too soon these Intervals decay, And in returning Sorrow melt away! Raving I curse the stretching Hills that rise To intercept the Pleasure of my Eyes: With mournful Looks I measure the wide Vale, And waft kind Wishes in each passing Gale; Then melancholy, mourn my self asleep, And my sad Soul in Tears and Slumbers steep. Sometimes to lose, or chace my Cares away, I mix among the Hurry of the Day. Pensive, I wander thro' each crowded Street, But lost my self, bewail my faithless Feet, The Streets to my distemper'd Fancy seem But swimming Shadows of a sickly Dream: While to my Mind the fluctuating Crouds, Appear but solitary waving Woods. Where-e'er I turn my thoughtful Eyes, I find All, but the lovely Image of my Mind; 'Till lost in wild Rapidity of Thought, Amaz'd, I wonder at the Place I sought. If I to Books, and Study take Recourse, Ev'n Books, and Study lose their wonted Force; For what's persuasive Eloquence to me, Unless to breathe my Love-sick Soul to thee! And why should I perplexing Thoughts explore, My Mind's too thoughtful to admit of more. Thus I the Drudgery of Life pursue, For Life's but painful Bondage void of You; My Cares, almost despairing of Relief, Turn fancy'd Pleasures into real Grief. But O my lovely Laura, charming Fair, Joy of my Soul, and Object of my Prayer; By all those Transports that my Soul exprest, When I lean'd trembling on your panting Breast: By all those Languishments that told my Love, Those Languishments which then could Laura move! By those dear Sighs that on each Whisper hung, And sweeten'd e'en the Music of your Tongue: So may kind Fortune try each happy Art, To join true Lovers which she cannot part. Inviolable let our Vows remain: And imitate, my Dear, your faithful Swain. On a Rose gathered, by Laura, in Winter. While fierce inclement Storms descend, And Forests with the Winter bend; While no kind genial Suns appear, To mollify the frozen Year; Tell me, Laura, in what Skies Could this early Rose arise! Or perhaps the Queen of Love, A Sister's Kindness for to prove, Sent it from her Cyprian Grove. But blushing don't deny, my Dear, If I should tell you how, or where, You found the little Wonder grow, Rising from a Bed of Snow: For we have Reasons to suffice, 'Twas created by your Eyes; That Nature by a sudden Look For the Sun their Beams mistook; They shed their Influence on the Earth; And smiling blest the fragrant Birth: By their genial Rays it grew Sweet in Odour, sweet in Hue, Full of Beauty, full of you. But whilst you blush, to hear me say, Things so far from Reason's Way, You your very self betray. For 'twas that Blush, with which you glow, That Blush which e'en revives me too! That could such wond'rous Influence give; Create, and make a Flower live. Achilles in the Nymph conceal'd, Was by the Warrior's Hand reveal'd. Then, Laura, since it is your own, Let a Mother's Love be shown: In dewy Tears it mourns for Rest, Then take your Infant to your Breast. For since at first it sprung from Snow, And there, 'tis likely, loves to grow; Your Bosom's the best place I know; For that not only has the Hue, But e'en the very Coldness too. On Laura's Singing. When Laura's tuneful Airs my Soul surprize, And fan the Flame created by her Eyes; Forgetful of myself, I rashly gaze On the dear Magic of her fatal Face; Each soft'ning Sound my melting Soul disarms, And I'm an easy Conquest to her Charms. Thus the bold Warriour, with undaunted Eye, Sees scatter'd Troops and Armies round him die; Inspir'd with Music's animating Sounds, In Death he triumphs, and he smiles at Wounds, Undaunted views with Pride the deadly Dart; Nor fears it, till he feels it in his Heart. To Laura, walking in the Rain. See, lovely unrelenting Laura, see, The very Heavens bewail your Cruelty! The sobbing Breezes to my Grief reply, Weep to my Tears, and to my Murmurs sigh: In-animate, my Pity they regard, And mourn a Nymph so soft, and yet so hard! But wretched Swain for ever now despair, Nor fondly hope to melt the cruel Fair; For how should Mortal's Sighs and Tears prevail, When even thus the Gods themselves can fail! To Laura, who thought I mistook her for another in the Dark. I Tho' Night her deepest Sables spread, To favour the Deceit; Tho' you yourself, my lovely Maid, Conspir'd, I knew the Cheat. II But yet, my charming Nymph, I swear By that dear stolen Kiss, That you can cheat me any where, Or any way but this. III You wonder since each Lover's blind, How I could Laura know! But pardon me, severely kind, They're such, that Cupid's so. IV Nor think I boast I found the Cheat By my own, but by your Eyes; 'Twas they for once, free from Deceit, 'Twas they discover'd the Disguise. V 'Tis they alone the Sun outshine, Like his, their Darts are hurl'd; Like his their Office is divine, But guide a nobler World. Laura's Picture. When Nature form'd the lovely Spartan Maid, Hellen. Amaz'd the charming Wonder she survey'd; And thus delighted cry'd: At length in Greece, With safety I may claim a finish'd Piece. Yet soon she found, in spight of all her Boast, Those Beautis but in human Frailties lost. The Goddess griev'd at what she first essay'd, But common Beauties for long Ages made; 'Till once beholding Britain's beauteous Isle, Where ev'ry thing conspir'd to make her smile, Her former Hopes reviv'd with secret Joy, Awak'd her Pleasure to some new Employ: Yet still she fear'd th' irreparable Cost That once was in a fatal Beauty lost; And nicely cautious, did at first impart But half the Power of her wondrous Art: On beauteous Rosamonda try'd her Charms; And gave the Present to great Henry's Arms: Then exercis'd her nice creating Care, To make one virtuous too as well as fair; In Sacharissa shew'd her justest Art, The sweetest Face, and the severest Heart. But fearing yet again to be betray'd, For she ne'er knew the Woman's Heart she made, Waller the tunefull'st of the tuneful Swains, With all the softest, and the gentlest Strains, By cunning Nature was inspir'd, to prove The Nymph superior to the Power of Love. Confirm'd at length, the Goddess now design'd To make One perfect Wonder of the Kind, And all her Charms at once in Laura join'd. On a Feather in her Hair. If Laura but wear it, a Feather can charm, Ah who can be safe, if a Feather can harm? Since first I beheld it, the Life I have led! All Quiet and Ease with the Feather are fled. Fly Youth from my Laura, whoever thou art, And, warn'd by the Feather, beware of the Dart. Hellen and Laura. Alluding to Mr. Dryden's Epigram on Milton. See, another Allusion to this Epigram in Mr. Pattison's Life. Vol. 1st. Page 7. Two charming Nymphs to Man's Destruction born, One Græcia did, one England does adorn. The first bright Fair too kindly fatal lov'd, This by Severities as fatal prov'd: Alas! how different is our equal Fate! For that Age fell by Love, and this by Hate. To a Lady, fishing. Nay, now I yield—for who could e'er withstand A Foe victorious both by Sea, and Land. But cannot Earth afford you Slaves enow, That thus you triumph o'er the Water too? Yet I confess these Realms to you belong, Because at first from them fair Beauty sprung; From them originally took its Rise, Its boundless Power and Inconstancies. And lo! the finny Nations of the Flood, As if they knew you too, around you croud. Ah! little harmless Wantons timely fly The magic Influence of her fatal Eye; In vain these Floods! where now secure ye shun The scorching Fury of the Mid-day Sun: In vain shall they oppose their cooling Streams, To guard ye from Belinda's fiercer Beams. Here you, bright Nymph, your subject Realms survey, And see both Elements alike obey: At once victorious with your Hands and Eyes, You make the Fishes, and the Men your Prize; And while the pleasing Slavery we court, I fear you captivate us both for Sport. But ah! fair Nymph, be cautious, and beware, Nor to the faithless Margin press too near; Lest ravish'd with your Charms, some wat'ry God, Surpriz'd, behold you from his blue Abode; And hoping long-lost Venus to regain, Should bear you to the Bottom of the Main. THE Fatal Request to Cupid. Shew me, said I, thou mighty God of Love, The brightest Nymph that ever trod the Grove; When thus the laughing Deity reply'd; Well, Swain, for once I'll gratify thy Pride: Laurinda's Form divinely fair behold, And that the Boast more safely may be told, Here, take a Signal of her Power; this Dart: He said, and fiercely shot it in my Heart. On hearing a very homely, and deformed Lady sing finely. While with strange Surprize, I see A Form so foul! such Harmony! I fancy Things too strange to tell,— A sudden Taste of Heaven and Hell: That some bright Angel from above, Pleas'd a-while on Earth to rove, Invisible to every Eye, Has left the Regions of the Sky; Cœlestial Harmony to show To us Mortals here below. And now, (O listen) now I hear, The very Music of the Sphere! Unseen the Angel hovers round, Melting in harmonious Sound. But hideous Balba strangely vain, With moving Lips usurps the Strain: While her Shape, and Figure show, A Fiend just conjur'd from below; A Fiend, that but upon Parole, From Hell, to hear such Musick, stole; Knowing when she returns again, The sure Succession of her Pain; And learns these Notes to sooth her Grief, Which in her Torments bring Relief; To charm each horrid Scene of Woe, And make another Heaven below. To a Friend in Love. In vain, my Damon, you look pale, and write, Languish all Day, and sigh away the Night; For while these inconsistent Forms you try, She thinks you rival her Inconstancy. Then show the Man again, and re-assume The sprightly Pride of One-and-twenty's Bloom: With Courage take her in your longing Arms, And when she's conquer'd, she must yield her Charms. Long thus in borrow'd Shapes Vertumnus strove To cheat the fair Pomona into Love; Yet still he try'd his Fallacies in vain, She mock'd the Soldier, and she scorn'd the Swain: But when his proper Form the God confess'd, Yielding, she clasp'd him to her panting Breast. The Disappointed Maid, and the drowzy Swain. A TALE. As Dolly and her fav'rite Swain Were interrupted by the Rain, From tedding out the fragrant Hay; Beneath a shelt'ring Cock they lay: When thus the lovely, longing Jade, Unto the drowzy Shepherd said, Nay, prithee Lobby, why so sleepy? Indeed—upon my Word I'll nip ye.— How pretty might we sit, and chat, Tell o'er old Stories, and all that.— But you—O L?d, the careless Beast! As if Folks lie down to take Rest. Lob, half asleep, made no Replies, Or answer'd with a Grunt her Sighs. While she to be reveng'd, arose, And play'd a Tickler in his Nose. (But some, the Virgin to disgrace, Will say, 'twas in another Place.) Be that as 'twill, she wak'd the Swain, And tickled him with Words again. Come Sweeting, Lobby, come my Dear, I'm sure that nobody is near; Indeed we may, pray ben't afraid, Poor I am but an harmless Maid For since you're so dispos'd to rest, Pray take a Nap upon my Breast. You see Time, Leisure, Place, and all For such Employment, seem to call. And you remember People say, When the Sun shines, then make your Hay. Augh! Augh! quoth Lob, wak'd with Surprize, To see the Sun flame in his Eyes. Heigh hoa! come Doll, for as you say, The Sun shines, we must make our Hay; So reach me there my Rake and Prong, 'Twas well you wak'd—we've slept too long. The Case stated. Inter cæsa, &amp; porrecta. Horace, I think, prescribes this Rule, (And surely Horace is no Fool) Poets should keep, e'er the World knows it, Their Poems nine Years in their Closet: I own the Fancy's very good; But pray, let this be understood: Your meagre Poets now-a-days, Write more for Profit than for Praise: And whilst their Poems live in Garret, Themselves, alas! may die for Claret. A PROLOGUE TO THE FUNERAL: A COMEDY. Supposed to be spoken before the University of Cambridge. I've very often heard what Fear can do, But never found the sad Effects till now; And now my Face in sober Sadness shows it, But hush—before each teazing Coxcomb knows it. Pray Sirs, forgive me if I shrewdly guess, The latent Meaning of this sable Dress; Did not I know ye, I should think ye come, Like Ravens, to foretel our Poet's Doom; But since we act the Funeral to-day, We'll but suppose ye Mourners in the Play. Yet thanks to Fate, some dawning Hopes appear, Break thro' the Gloom, and gild the low'ring Sphere. Lo! Comet-like the Commoners arise, And as the streaming Light'ning gild the Skies, But thank 'em, they're too witty to be wise. Like Light'ning, yet I fear, they'll blast our Toil, And wound the very Place, on which they smile. But O ye Sophs, ye mighty Men of Wit! You that so well can lord it o'er a Pit! For once guard this with ruminating Face, And stand the solemn Guardians of the Place! Clear it from snearing, sly, pretending Fools, And lug the beardless Criticks to the Schools: So may the Fresh-men ev'ry Pun approve, So may your Puns the Fresh-mens Jokes reprove. So may your Gravities with equal Ease, Guzzle fat College-Ale, or take Degrees, Turn Pedants, Parsons, Criticks, what ye please. But if the Play's intolerably bad, And nothing but Damnation can be had; Torment it with your criticising Tools, Time, Place, and Characters, and twenty Rules; Nay, use it like a Fresh-man in the Schools. But pray, good surly Gentlemen, be sure ye Observe the just Decorum of a Fury; And this, among the rest, a Maxim hold, That, Vixens always clap their Hands and scold. The Enjoyment. Come my Laura, come my Love; Come my tender Turtle-Dove; Let us from this Heat retire, To languish in a softer Fire. How the waving Elms invite us! How these Rosy Bowers delight us! How their am'rous Foldings twine, To imitate thy Arms and mine! See these Snowy Lillies blowing, With the blushing Roses glowing, Silently the Soul inspire, To kindle at thy Lover's Fire: See these springing Violets rise, Animated by thy Eyes; Lavishly their Charms they spread, To make a soft enamel'd Bed; And like this downy swelling Breast, They rise, and languish to be press'd. But O thou happy, happy Grove, Sacred to the God of Love, With the thickest Umbrage shade us, Let no piercing Rays invade us: Let no Light but Beauty's charm us, Let no Heat but Beauty's warm us: Make our artificial Light, Close and sweet as our Delight. And now, my Dear, no longer coy, Let us give a Loose to Joy! Then, closely lay thy Lips to mine, And let our Souls and Bodies join: Let me suck thy balmy Breath, And fainting, glory in my Death. Take me dying to thy Arms, And revive me with thy Charms. Ah me! I die with pleasing Pain, O kindle me to Life again. And now, my brighter Queen of Love, I'll confess the stronger Jove. O happiest Transport, dearest Blessing, Sweetest Rapture past expressing! Who can tell the thrilling Pleasure, When the Nymph resigns her Treasure! When she melts in ripen'd Blisses, Breathing out her Soul in Kisses! When in Paradise she lies, And rolls her pretty dying Eyes: While the Snake with softer Strains, Sweetly stings her tickling Veins! She pants, she sighs, she heaves her Charms, And locks her vig'rous Lover in her Arms. A Description of his Mistress. She's young, and She's tender, She's handsomely slender, She's genteel, She's pretty, Good-natur'd, and witty: Adorn'd with those Graces, We want in some Faces; But moves,—O most sweetly! Then dances so neatly! No Scandal she tattles, But agreeably prattles; Learns Love and such Fancies, From Plays, and Romances. Is proud, but a little, And my Soul to a Tittle. Sent Me, from a Lady, with a Rose. Whilst these vernal Sweets exhale, Whilst you bless the Rosy Gale; Think upon the Giver's State, Think, and O compare our Fate! View your Laura, view her Flower, Smiling Daughters of an Hour! Sweet's our Beauty, fair our Hue; Sweet, and fair, at least to you. When with tender Ardour prest, We lie blushing on your Breast: Happy! could we still enjoy; Happy! could we never cloy: Happy! could we keep our Charms From, or, ever in those Arms! But when once those Charms decay, Both, like Weeds, are thrown away. On an Apple, given me by Laura. Sure all submit to lovely Laura's Charms, Who with a thousand Darts an Apple arms; With Adoration I approach'd the Dame, My Hand receiv'd the Fruit, my Soul the Flame: Alas, too deep I feel the deadly Smart, I gain'd an Apple, but I lost my Heart. A Song. I Shepherd! if you see me, fly; And why should that thy Fears create? Maids may be too often shy, As well in Love, as Hate. If from you I fly away, 'Tis because I fear to stay. II Should I out of Hatred run, Much less would be my Pains and Care. But the Youth I love, I shun; Who can such a Trial bear? Who, that such a Swain could see, Or who can love, and fly like me! III Cruel Duty bids me go, But gentle Love commands my Stay, Pity, still to Love a Foe; O shall I this, or that obey? Duty frowns, and Cupid smiles, That destroys, but this beguiles. IV Ever by this Crystal Stream, O! I could sit me down and weep; Ravish'd with the pleasing Theme, O! 'tis worse than Death to sleep; But the Danger is so great, That Love gives Wings, instead of Hate. V Shepherd! if you love me, leave me, Leave me to my Self alone, O! you may with Ease deceive me! Prithee, charming Boy, be gone! Heaven has decreed that we must part, That has my Vows, but you my Heart. On hearing a Lady sing Prior's Alexis. I When Philly sings these tender Strains, Such magic Airs the Notes improve, I languish with the Shepherd's Pains, And kindle at another's Love. II Some from a sweet bewitching Eye, Receive the gaily fatal Dart; Their Cupid's Arrows I defy, 'Tis Musick only strikes my Heart. III But when soft Strains, and Beauty's Charms, Harmoniously to wound, conspire; A double Stroke my Breast disarms, And breathing Musick blows the Fire. IV Such is charming Philly's Power, Enchanting Smiles, enchanting Sound! That were we from her Eyes secure, Her Voice, with latent Force would wound. V Thus when keen Light'nings gild the Skies, The Trav'ler shakes with holy Dread; Trembles as the Flashes rise, Nor sees the Bolt that strikes him dead. VI So soft! so sweet the Charmer sings, Each yielding Thought the Strains controul. But Love—and Love from Music springs, That sooths, with piercing Sounds, the Soul. VII But would the powerful Charmer try This Token of her Art to prove, To melt me first with Harmony, Then make me such as she can love! To a Lady, Who, in return for a Copy of Verses, sent me a flower'd Cap. Is this, dear Maid! the Price of all my Pains, My Sighs, my Prayers, and never-ceasing Strains? Fair Daphne thus, a grateful Heart to show, The Lover scorn'd, but crown'd the Poet's Brow. On Crito One Ch?y, of St. John's Coll. a most vain Scribler, who bound up his own Rhymes in Turkey Leather, and set 'em off with Pictures. See his Character in the Session of Poets. Vol. 1. page 28., who wrote against Me. They say that out of pure Ill-Nature Crito has lately wrote a Satire; On me too—That the silly Elf Should be forgetful of Himself! Satire's a very dangerous thing, And often wears a double Sting; And tho' it chance to lose its Aim, It seldom fails in getting Game. So Gun enrag'd to miss the Black-bird, Recoiling, knocks poor Lobcock backward. But Crito tells me, full of Choler, He'as drawn me in my proper Colour; I thank him for his merry Whim, And fain would do the same by him; But hang it tho', 'tis cursed Cost, To daub an Ass on every Post! But all consider'd tho', I think I'ad e'en as good take up with Ink: On second Thoughts too, 'cause 'tis black, It seems the very thing I lack, For I am apt to think his Soul Is somewhat darker than a Coal. But yet, old Boy, I see in spight Of all your forc'd ill-natur'd Wit, The very self-same thing you strive at; The very End and Aim you drive at: But faith I han't Time, tho' you lack now, The Favour Dryden did for Flecknoe. And slily want to steal in Print, And that I'm sure is all that's in't. So Country-Girl, in Breeding awkard, Whips up Ralph's Chair, and tilts him backward; Tho' all the while she means no Hurt, And does it, as she says, for Sport: Ay, ay, but if I rightly guess, Her Sport, summ'd up, amounts to this; That she, in jest, may teach the Clown To throw herself in earnest down. On Reading the Turtle and Sparrow, A TALE. These Verses are prefixed to Mr. Prior's Posthumous Works. Printed for H. Curll in the Strand. Let Tears no more lament the Dead in vain, For see! our easy Prior lives again. These genuine Lines the gentle Bard reveal, And paint that Nature he alone could feel: With tender Accents touch the soft'ning Soul, Or gaily mock the Philosophic Fool. When Turturella tells her piteous Moan, Who does not make the Mourner's Grief his own? How ravishingly sweet the Numbers move, And breathe the dying Agonies of Love! Such sympathizing Tenderness impart, They melt the Reader's to a Lover's Heart. But while th' inimitable Bard displays, The wanton Sparrow in gallanter Lays; The Marriage-State is image'd to the Life, The careless Husband and the peevish Wife; The Troubles of the fet-lock'd Couple shew, And either Sex is open'd to the View. Thus sung delightful Matt—but sings no more, Long since lamented on the lonesome Shore; Pensive for Him in vain my Voice essays, To court Thalia to her Poet's Praise; Like Turturella she neglects her Charms, Despairing of another Prior's Arms: Alike their Tenderness, alike their Woe, For what Columbo was, is Prior now: Time's Period past—He shall for ever live, And like these Labours by his Death revive. On seeing Mr. Prior's Monument in Westminster-Abbey. Say, Prior, stands this Busto here to show; Thy Life had not its Vanities enow; Alluding to these Words of Mr. Prior in his Will (after having ordered a Monument) “For this last Piece of Human Vanity, I Will, “that the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds be set aside. And could a Poet, that immortal Name, Implore the Chissel's Charity of Fame? A Receipt to make a Modern Poet. Semper ego Auditor— Q. Well then—when will these Railings end? A. Lord Sir, as soon as Poets mend. Q. But durst thou thus, profanely bold, Thy Argument so stiffly hold? Restrain in time this sour ill-Nature, And dread The Universal Satire. Dr. Young's Universal Passion. How durst you say (nay ne'er deny, And poorly truckle with a Lye) That ex probato you could show it, We scarce have now one Perfect Poet. A. Why what I think, Sir, still I'll stand to, And what I say I'll set my Hand to: But lest uncourteously you think, I mix ill-Nature with my Ink, For leaving out Pack, Prior, Pope, This Answer may suffice I hope— Q. Faith Sir, you're very wise I own, Is Homer then no better known? Tibullus and old Chaucer too, I wonder you forget them so. A. Those Bards, but now, you heard me name, And are not These the very same, Alike their Worth, alike their Fame! For Nature conscious of the Cost, (And her Receipt-Poetic lost) In Prior, Pack, and Pope infuses Their very transmigrated Muses; But now since Nature thus knocks under, Let's see how Art can work a Wonder; And where the Lion's Skin shall fail, We'll patch it with the Fox's Tail. Well then—Imprimis—Recipe— Q. But what? How much?— A. Why let me see, First, take, a little Stock of Learning, Then, a less Portion of Discerning, Sufficient, if you reach the Rules (Of Ipse Dixit, and the Schools) Next take, of Vanity enough, Modest-Assurance, Irish proof; Then frugally to spare your Wit, Take something that resembles it; And to prevent a thousand things Which Judgment to my Fancy brings, This one Ingredient is the best, (Nay faith 'tis worth e'en all the rest, For I have known it oft prevail Where Art and stronger Nature fail) I mean a very good Estate, But 'tis so hard to get of late! To this infuse a Knack of Rhyming, Then set the Whirligig a chyming. These, nicely mix, but if you lack more, You'll find 'em all summ'd up in Blackmore. The Battle of the Pygmies and Cranes.

With his Dissertation upon the Classicks. Printed for H. Curll, in the Strand. Contending Troops, and Fields of Death I sing, Ye tuneful Nine your sacred Succour bring, In Arms my Pygmy-Sons of Fame prepare, And rouze the Cranic Furies to the War; Their Acts, their Valour, and their Worth rehearse, And let their slaughter'd Heroes live in Verse. The Wrath of Peleus' Son, the Golden Fleece, With all the num'rous labour'd Themes of Greece, Long since exhausted, are too vulgar grown, To shine in any Colours but their own; Who does not know the pious Prince of Troy? And William's Triumphs ev'ry Tongue employ: Whilst in reviving Numbers I pursue, A Theme less Glorious, but a Theme more new; Wars yet unsung, and Warriours yet unknown, Rush thro' the Fields of Air my Brow to crown. Where Indian Groves their warmer Shades display, Blest with the earliest Influence of the Day, Deep in a Vale, by Nature's Hand secur'd, With Woods defended, and with Rocks immur'd, In happier Days indulgent Fate design'd To fix the Empire of the Pygmy Kind: Here long in easy State the Nation reign'd, Soft Peace indulging what their Toils obtain'd. O happy had it known an happy Life, Serene from Cares, and unally'd to Strife: But heedless Mortals ever blind to Fate, Rush on impenitently, wise too late! For now the tender-hearted Traveller, Weeping, beholds the sad Effects of War; No more he views, alas! with sweet Surprize, The early Hopes of future Empires rise: But O! the miserable Turn of Fate, Presents reverse, a ruinated State; Skulls, broken Arms, a pallid Horrour spread, The wretched Ruins of the mighty Dead! While with insulting Pride the Cranic Foe Menaces Vengeance on the Bones below: Triumphantly the screaming Tyrants reign, And proudly lord it o'er th' unpeopled Plain. Not thus they dar'd when happier Days of Yore, Loudly confess'd the potent Pygmies Power: How timorously then they skimm'd the Air! And e'en in Clouds, imagin'd Pygmies near. Then durst the boldest Crane the Plains invade, His forfeit Life the certain Ransom paid; His mangled Carcass furnish'd out a Feast, At once the Banquet, and at once the Guest: Or could he rarely 'scape their hostile Rage, 'Twas but with greater Evils to engage: For he no sooner to his Nest returns, But that despoil'd with bleeding Infants mourns; Eluded Danger gives him no Relief, Weeping, he dies with fond paternal Grief. From these inhuman Villanies arose The Cranes Resentment, and the Pygmies Woes; Hence dreadful Wars ensu'd, and direful Arms, That shook the peaceful Country with Alarms. Less Wrongs resented, and less noble Rage, In former Days did Homer's Muse engage, When to the Field his downy Chiefs he led, With sable Troops of croaking Heroes spread: Deep thro' the Vales confounding Clamours rise, And in hoarse Echoes murmur to the Skies; Disjointed Heroes of their Limbs bereft, Bewail the useless Life that Fate has left. And now the great, th' important Day appear'd, A Day for ever by the Pygmies fear'd! Now conscious of their Crimes, they view their Fate, And penitentially grow wise too late! In vain the Cranes their plumy Troops prepare, And rally all their Forces to the War; Summon'd the Chiefs that drink Cayister's Stream, Receive the welcome Call, and thirst for Fame; Cold Scythia pours her winged Armies forth, And heads the hardy Millions of the North. Fomented Wrongs their injur'd Souls excite, Burn for Revenge, and kindle to the Fight; Eager they meditate their absent Foes, And exercise imaginary Blows: Imaginary Conquests swell their Minds, And each Breast labours with some vast Designs. But now warm Breezes melt the frozen Year, And warbling Birds bespeak the Summer near: Embody'd then the winged Nations rise, Darken the Day, and stretch along the Skies; In sounding Gales the hov'ring Armies flow, And seem a Tempest to the World below. Shrill screaming Thunders thro the Welkin fly, And terribly presage Destruction nigh. AN EPISTLE TO HIS MAJESTY, King GEORGE II. On his Accession to the Throne. The Author died on the Day, he was to have been introduced to the King, with this Poem, viz. July 10th, 1727. My Sacred Liege, if Sorrow cease to flow, And reasoning Nature yield a Pause to Woe, In the sad Silence of Ideal Gloom, Whilst Death, triumphant, mocks the Monarch's Tomb, Reflect, how Glory crouds Life's narrow Span! And let the Prince recover from the Man. Bend, then, auspicious o'er Thy filial Isle, And with a Father's Eye her Grief beguile; Joy, o'er her Tears, in gentle Smiles diffuse, As rising Suns melt off the Morning Dews. Beam'd on my Breast, how full Thy Glories shine! Nor more by Lineage, than by Virtue Thine. From Heaven deriv'd, in Pity to our Woes, By Virtue, first, the Right to Rule arose: What time Great Souls to tame the World began, And broke the wild Barbarians into Man; Then, stricter Laws their loose Desires restrain'd, And thro' the Paths of Justice, wisely rein'd: Aw'd then, destructive Rapine learn'd to cease, And jarring Factions harmoniz'd in Peace. As some pure Stream, the hurrying Tempest o'er, Serenely winds along the Flowery Shore, Progressive, paints the Borders as they rise; And each still Scene with living Nature vies. Calm'd thus for Thought, and actively refin'd, Dawn'd fair Ideas on the forming Mind; Hence, the fam'd ATHENS rich in Science grew, And Arts still follow'd where ROME's Eagles flew; Hence, too, victorious o'er the Powers of SPAIN, Late Times shall own the Wonders of Thy Reign, Reviv'd, those ancient Sons of Genius see, And all their Godlike Patrons crown'd in THEE! Lost in the Vision of Futurity, Slowly the Muse steals back her ravish'd Eye, And nobly kindling at an earlier Aim, Dates the bright Æra of Thy growing Fame. Nor shall the Pomp of the Slow-moving Train, Charm to the Vulgar-Gaze! her Sight detain: Poor were the Praise, on Themes like those to dwell, Where Thornhill's Colours might the Verse excel! Unnoted pass the wide Procession by ? True Greatness strikes alone the mental Eye! Shot thro' the Covert of a Court's Disguise, That reads thy Soul; for there the Monarch lies! And there, in every Attribute exprest, As once on MOSES, sees the GOD confest. Thrice happy Hand of Power, to THEE assign'd, To awe, to govern, and to bless Mankind! To call forth humble Virtue into Fame, To shade the Titled Villain o'er with Shame, With Force to rescue where the Proud oppress, And count a kind of Merit from Distress; Or, when despairing in the Cave of Grief, Surprize the sentenc'd Sinner back to Life, And by the Favour of one Smile supply, What gasping Monarchs would with Empires buy. How great these Acts!—but, since their Praise were poor, Let me, at least, in Thought, indulge them o'er! Confess the Pride would with my Wish agree, And bend my Heart, O Power! to envy Thee! Then Mercy! shouldst thou melt each harden'd Soul, And Vice turn Virtue by thy soft Controul: For Man by Nature is a doubtful Soil, And wildly fertile asks the Tiller's Toil; Yet the same Place, where the rank Venom grows, Blushful, may blossom forth the fragrant Rose. Blest be the Prince, who thus his Power employs, He moves in Smiles, and lives in circling Joys; Superior to the Tyrant's savage Arts, Founds his firm Empire on his Subjects Hearts; From gentlest Virtues draws the noble Plan, And proves the Monarch something more than Man. 'Twas thus we saw Thee, lost in sweet Surprize, Prelude AUGUSTUS to our ravish'd Eyes; Delightful Prospects dawn'd on every Breast, And All the glorious Interval confess'd! Nor dwell we distant on the backward Hour, Urg'd by fresh Views enlarging on before; Brightening down Ages, with progressive Shine, They kindle Souls, in vain, to rival thine: Whilst thro' the Mist of Time thy Fame appears, The laurel'd Victress of ten thousand Years! Yet wilt thou still the Course of Glory run, Rise, height'ning into Lustre, like the Sun: For generous Minds, tho' Miracles were wrought, Mourn every Act below their towering Thought: Thus, tho' our Eye stretch the long Landscape o'er To the last Point, our Reason flies before. As in full Circles of Delight we rove, Ev'n Loyalty itself is lost in Love; Whilst crowded Nations, gazing from the Heart, With honest Nature mock the Muse's Art. No more the Labourer mourns his empty Toil; Nor foreign Weeds infect our happy Soil, Joyful, we see our Stores on Stores increase, The bounteous Growth of Liberty and Peace. O, Fair BRITANNIA! Empress of the Main, Fresh spring the Joys, an ever-blooming Train! Steal them one Moment from thy downy Rest, (For 'twas still thine to pity the distress'd;) O'er thy wide Ocean cast thy gentle Eye, There learn how Lands unciviliz'd may die; And, as thou mourn'st their Happiness o'erthrown, Nearly reflect, and learn to prize thy own: Nor envy Nations that remotely run To the full Influence of a warmer Sun, When all the various Sweets their Products boast, Transported, flourish on our happier Coast. Yet thy rich Plains with equal Bounty smile, And all Elysium opens in thy Isle. What yellowing Harvests o'er thy Mountains flow, Wave down, and thicken all the Vale below! How the glad Merchant views, with greedy Pride, The World's Abundance pour in every Tide! E'en Avarice, here, might sate her thirsty Eyes, There, Famine feast, and into Plenty rise! In this Profusion of increasing Joy, Heaves e'er a Breast, or streams a tearful Eye! Let grating Envy now alone deplore, E'en injur'd Merit is a Crime no more! Nor doom'd to watch a chearless Life away, Like a dull Dial on a Winter's Day. Sinks there opprest, to Shades obscure confin'd, The mournful Merits of a generous Mind; To CAROLINA, breathe the modest Prayer, Her gentle Soul can charm away Despair! Her gentle Soul from Want's last Verge retriev'd, And e'en the Shade of ancient Worth reliev'd: The Royal Bounty, sent to Milton's Daughter. The good Old Genius saw thy Gifts engage, And mock'd the Malice of a grateless Age. How lost in sweet Surprize, the World admir'd, When all the Woman to a Saint aspir'd; What Time Religion's purer Flame out-shone The dazzling Splendours of a German Throne! Charm'd with the Prospect of thy future Isle, Silent she bad thee every Wish beguile; Sees Britain's Crown thy softer Power employ, The glittering Earnest of immortal Joy! Still then the Promise of our Hopes maintain; Still dawn fresh Wonders for a future Reign; And lo! advancing to maturer Years, GREAT FREDERICK, Image of his Sire, appears! Paternal Virtues all his Soul engage; And blooming Youth divines a fruitful Age! So, on the yellowing Orange-Tree, appear, The flowery Tokens of a golden Year; Fair, o'er the falling Fruits, new Beauties rise, And all the sweet Succession never dies. POEMS AND TRANSLATIONS: Wrote by Mr. Pattison, When at Appleby-School; Which were in the Custody of a Friend at York, and, now by him, communicated to the Editor. A Pastoral. 'Twas when the pearly Wings of Rosy Light, Had chac'd the melancholy Shades of Night; Each blushing Shrub with glitt'ring Diamonds gleam'd, Each Field a Firmament of Spangles seem'd. Refreshing Breezes wav'd the verdant Woods, And fann'd the panting Bosom of the Floods: Each Swain arose refresh'd with downy Sleep, And pipe'd, and whistled to his frisking Sheep. But sad Sireno no Delights could move, Wild were his Thoughts with late neglected Love. For him each Virgin sigh'd, but sigh'd in vain, Whilst lovely Laura show'd unjust Disdain. On ev'ry neighb'ring Tree he carv'd her Name, And with the living Letters grew his Flame. To her the Firstlings of his Flock he brought, For her the earliest Greens and Flowers he sought. But all in vain—the lovely cruel Fair As unrelenting as his barren Care. No downy Slumbers lull'd his Soul to rest, Sleep fled his Eyes, as Quiet did his Breast: If some faint Slumber o'er his Temples crept, Yet wakeful Love eternal Vigils kept. In fancy'd Dreams he'd catch the lovely Maid, But waking, curse the visionary Shade. To a Lady. A Paraphrastical Translation of the third Ode of the second Book of Horace. Æquam memento rebus in arduis, &amp;c. I. Let not the Turns of Fate molest The sacred Quiet of your Breast; Tho' the black Storm hang hov'ring o'er your Head; Your Soul serene its Fury need not dread; Let Fortune guide your destin'd State, Yielding to Fortune, we subdue our Fate: But when the fickle Siren smiles, Trust not too far her treach'rous Wiles; Not let the flowing Joy, As it repays your Ill, your Calm annoy: Catch not with greedy Hopes the fleeting Shade; Black Storms will soon the visionary Scene invade; Like the alternate Shades of Day and Night, The particolour'd Thread of Life is black and white. II. Be our Lot good, or be it ill, It makes no Measure for the fatal Wheel, Should we spin out a wretched Life In Cares and melancholy Grief, 'Twere but in vain to beg of Fate, One fleeting Hour, to recompence our wretched State: Or should we in some pleasant Grove refine Our fading Life with sparkling Wine, 'Tis Fate's to measure Time, 'tis ours to live, Nor can e'en Fate and Jove the past retrieve. III. Since Fate is still the same, Then let us in some pleasant Grove, Lull'd with the Murmurs of the purling Stream, Banish all Cares and doubtful Life improve; We'll quaff the sprightly Wine, While Beauty fires the Eyes, and Fancy fills the Vein; With Sweets anoint your flowing Hair, And let it float and wanton in the Air, Loose, and neglected as your Care. Let the sweetest Flowers be brought, Let the Rosy Wreath be wrought; Let the short-liv'd Chaplet be A Type of frail Mortality, T' admonish us to catch the Golden Now; While Youth and blooming Beauty bless at once the Brow. Thus will we live and flourish while we may, Thus will we live and say; “To-morrow Life is Fate's, 'tis ours to-day. IV. Be quick, be quick, we cannot live too fast, This pleasing Rapture cannot last, An Age already's idly past! Lo! rapid Hours roll round apace, Now, now, unseen they swiftly steal the race: 'Tis past, 'tis past,—and now I see The ghastly Head of bald Eternity! Grim Death brings up the Rear, In all the frightful Forms that Mortals fear: Now must we leave this transitory Stage, And mourn in vain an ill-spent Age! Our sweet Delights, our smiling Hours, Mossy Mountains, Murmuring Fountains, Shady Grottoes, rosy Bowers, Alas no more are ours! Of all our large Possessions Fate will but allow, At most a mournful Cypress Bough. Perhaps your Heir Will shed a counterfeiting Tear, A Tear but for the sake of your Estate, Which he must, with himself, too soon resign to Fate. V. Our Fates are mingled in one common Urn, Which soon or late must take their turn: The Great, the Poor, the Low, the High, Confus'dly blended lie; The Weak, the Strong, the Base, the Brave, Which here so different seem, are equal in the Grave; Nor can we in the Dust distinction see: And such as Hellen is, Belinda must thou be. VI. In vain the Hero toils, to shew his Worth, And from a Stem of Gods derives his Birth; In fighting Fields he turns the Scale of Fate, While Tyrants bow, and Kings around him wait; Yet at pale Death's approach, this godlike Brave Trembles amidst his Pomp, and shudders like his meanest Slave! Ah whither is his Strength and Courage flown, That made the subject World his own! How Tyrants trembled at his Nod, Alas where is the God! Where is his Pride, his Pomp, his Pageantry, Which brib'd and conquer'd all—except the Destiny, That whirls them in the Gulf of black Eternity. Now in some gloomy Abbey is he laid, Dismal and silent as the mould'ring Dead, Who could the World with one small Nod command, Has nothing but a scanty Spot of Land. Perhaps a Monument they raise, Which for a-while records his Praise: Where they inscribe his awful Name, And all the fleeting Charities of Fame. But then some Briar, or destroying Root, Will eat its way, and thro' the Marble shoot— The Tomb defac'd! this great, this god-like King, Is a Romantic Tale, and a forgotten Thing. 1722. Æt. 15. Upon Belinda, who, gathering a Rose, prick'd her Finger. When you, bright Nymph, design'd to crop a Rose, To kiss your sweeter Hand, the Buds arose: Your heedless Hand a pointed Prickle prest, Stung with the Wound, you sunk into my Breast. If so small Wounds can cause so great a Smart, Think, O Belinda, on my bleeding Heart! The Conquest. Oft had I read of Cupid's Arms, His matchless Power, resistless Charms, How he defy'd Jove's thund'ring Hand, Tho' loaded with the flaming Brand; These Wonders put me to a stand. But when I found this mighty God a Boy, Naked, defenceless, blind, his Arms a Toy; I laugh'd to think the Gods were foil'd By such a little silly Child: When Rosalinda strait came by, Keen roguish Lightning arm'd her Eye, Pity, fair Nymph, I faint, I die— No more I'll wonder at this Infant's Art, When your bright Eyes direct and head the Dart. ON CONTENTMENT. Content, thou only Solace of the Mind, Whom all pretend to seek, but none can find; Tell me, O Goddess, in what foreign Seat, Or Realm unknown remains your blest Retreat; Where I may lull my raging Thoughts to rest, And calm the Tempest rising in my Breast: Say, shall I to the splendid Court repair, And make the proudest Thoughts my darling Care; Swell high my Soul—and now I am a God— Bow scepter'd Slaves, obey your Sov'reign's Nod— Content, I'll make you leave your humble Seat, You cannot, dare not scorn me now I'm great. Thus rav'd a Fool, when lo! stupendous Sight! A Nymph appear'd array'd in mantling Light; Bright was her Aspect, yet serenely mild, While thus she spoke, and as she spoke she smil'd. Forbear, vain Man, to seek Contentment here, Vain are your Hopes, and barren is your Care: Believe no Fortune can so high aspire, But proud, ambitious Thoughts are always higher: What tho' you reign proud Tyrant of the East, Yet Care, a greater Tyrant, rules your Breast; You, with a Nod, the suppliant World command, Yet cannot rule that little Empire, Man. Hope not in Wealth to find Contentment here, “For he that gathers Riches, gathers Care. Then curb this curst Ambition—dare be Poor, And find a richer in a poorer Store. Go, vain mistaken Man, if you would find That golden Ore, Contentment of the Mind, Depart from all these busy Ills of Life And live exempt from Pride, and Noise and Strife, From all the griping Bonds of Usury, From all the wicked Ills of Money free, Too low for Envy, for Contempt too high. She said—and vanish'd in a Flood of Light, Unto her blest Abodes, and left my Sight. A Divine Poem. Selected from the 18th, and 91st Psalms. To God, my Muse, address your loftiest Song, To God your Voice, your Lyre, your Lays belong; Awake his Actions in each heavenly Line, Great as his Goodness, as his Hand divine: But first, O Lord, my trembling Breast inspire, And fill my panting Soul with sacred Fire; So shall my Lays to blooming Honours rise, For what Heaven dictates, Time nor Age destroys. As the cœlestial Eagle stoops his Wings. While the small Wren upon his Pinions springs, Strait with a Bound he cuts his tow'ring Flight, Thro' floating Air, and Groves of living Light; The Wren with wonder views the Milky Way, And the bright Mansions of eternal Day; Wonders he does in Realms of Light unknown, Buoy'd up with rapid Pinions, not his own. So they who trust in God's Omnipotence, Find a safe Succour, and a sure Defence; Not all the Fears that guilty Mortals know, Can in their Souls create the smallest Woe; Sweet are their Thoughts, as sweetest Slumbers are, Calm as mild Evenings, as the Morning fair; No guilty Conscience breaks their sacred Rest, No foul Chimæras hover o'er their Breast, No dismal Visions dare invade their Head, Or pallid Phantoms stalk around their Bed: With springing Light no carking Cares are born, To cloud the pearly Beauty of the Morn; Not loudest Storms that roar from Pole to Pole, Can raise a Tempest in their settled Soul: Should pois'nous Pestilence infest the Sky, Angels would turn each tainted Arrow by, Spirits unseen would guard their sacred Rest, Play o'er their Head, and hover o'er their Breast. Should hissing Serpents on vast Volumes ride, And singe whole Forests with their spiral Pride; Pleas'd with Delight, they'd stroke the living Fire, The flaming Crest, and speckled Pride admire. Should roaring Lions' Thunder shake the Ground, To them 'twould seem the Cittern's Silver Sound: They hear the brazen Throat of War to roar, They hear—but like soft Music on the Shore. Tho' Floods of Foes my Soul serene surround, My God shall all their impious Rage confound; In God alone I find a sure Defence; With God who dare dispute Omnipotence? Witness the Day—Behold the Scene appears, A Grove of Lances, and a Wood of Spears, A gloomy Tempest threatens from afar Quick Fate, and flourishes an iron War: From azure Armour livid Lightnings play, And gild the Tempest with a momentary Day— O Lord—my God, the Floods my Soul surround, And num'rous Deaths appear in num'rous Forms around. O calm this Tempest with a single Nod, Thou canst, O Lord—I know thou canst, O God— Now say, my Muse, what Power disarm'd the Blow, And rais'd me from the deepest Depths of Woe? 'Twas God—for God alone such Miracles can do. Can you then cease his Goodness to adore! To Love, what can be less! and yet he asks no more. But lo! behold dark Horror sits around, A sudden Earthquake rocks th' astonish'd Ground. Behold that late insulting Troop appear, All pale and shivering with a panic Fear, Confusion leads the Van, and Death brings up the Rear. Half dead, for Shelter some to Rocks repair, In vain—the Rocks confess an equal Fear. Lo! Rivers plunge into their deepest Beds, And tott'ring Mountains bow their aged Heads, From their Foundations rugged Rocks are torn, And in black Whirlwinds thro' the Clouds are borne, From hollow Caverns, hoarse deep Murmurs roar, And drive the trembling Billows to the Shoar; From Pole to Pole tremendous Storms resound, Loud Thunders split the Heavens, loud Earthquakes rock the Ground. But now a Scene insufferably bright, O'erwhelms this Tempest with a Stream of Light— Unfolding Realms of Day the Terror raise, All Nature trembles, and the Heavens blaze— But lo! the God—his dreadful Form behold, In flaming Glory, and in fluid Gold! Congealing Darkness, with a Night of Clouds, His awful Majesty in Tempests shrouds; A Storm of pointed Thunder arms the God, A Seraph wing'd with Whirlwinds bears the dreadful Load; Forth from his Nostrils Sheets of Flame expire, He breathes a Tempest in a Flood of Fire; With dread Divinity the Heavens bow, The rolling Thunders fly, and Fate is in the Blow. Part of the 38?? and 39?? Chapters of Job, Paraphras'd in Blank Verse. But now the Lord ineffable and bright, Shot thro' the Regions of eternal Day; Swift as the Lightnings that his Vengeance throws, Buoy'd up with Whirlwinds, on a Cherub's Wings, He rode; all Nature trembled at her Lord, And quiv'ring Mountains bow'd their aged Heads; Whilst in a Storm of Thunders thus he spoke. Presumptuous Man that dar'st upbraid thy God, Shew the Omnipotence of which thou boasts; Awake thy Wisdom's Eye, with which thou dar'st Eclipse thy God's, and dive into his Secrets, Collect thy self, and let us try our Godheads. Wast thou a Being when no Being was, When Night and Darkness brooded o'er the Chaos, In endless Anarchy and wild Disorder? Didst thou from Nothing form this mighty Globe, On nothing hung, but pois'd in fluid Air Immoveable? or can thy dreaded Word Dissolve again its brittle Form to Nothing? Come shew some Miracle of Power and Wisdom, And make thy wonderful Creator wise. If since, thou hast attain'd this Power and Knowledge, Who canst thou boast the Tutor of thy Godhead— Thy self? exert thy Power upon thy self— Whence came those dire Afflictions that oppress thee? Dost thou afflict thy self? or canst thou cleanse Thy self from all those pestilential Pains? Since from thy self thou canst not boast this Power, From whence can it proceed but from thy God? Thy God, above all Power, all Light, all Knowlege! Fond Man, who know'st not how, or whence thou art, Curb this distemper'd Weakness of thy Brain: How canst thou mimic God, and challenge Nature, Who hast not the least Power o'er thy self! Say, can thy Thunder shake the solid Earth? Or can thy Voice, like mine, affright all Nature? Canst thou, like me, on winged Whirlwinds ride Thro' all the boundless Realms of endless Day? Dost thou shew bloody Comets in the Air, That shake Destruction from their flaming Tresses? Or hast thou seen the silent Seats of Death, Where Famine, War, and Plagues, and Pestilence Attend my Nod? Grim Ministers of Fate: Hast thou beheld the Chambers of the Deep, Where Ocean rises from his Coral Bed, Huge Marine Monsters gambol o'er the Ooze; Or hunt among the Waves their panting Prey. Say, didst thou form the great Leviathan, That seems a living Island, when he moves, He boils the Sea, and spouts it in a Tide. When rosy Morning gilds the gladsom Sky, Dost thou with liquid Diamonds sow the East? Guard'st thou the Sun o'er the cœlestial Plain, Thro' his nocturnal, and diurnal Course? Because he travels round the spacious Globe; Will he obsequious bear thy dread Behests; Can'st thou with deeper Roses paint the Welkin, And draw the sable Curtain of the West? Hush ev'ry Wind that curls the glassy Ocean, And ev'ry Breeze that waves the drowsy Grove? Can'st thou on all bestow soft balmy Slumbers, And cannot give thy self that wish'd-for Sleep? Dost thou ordain the pale-fac'd waning Moon To guide the Night, and fill the Stars with Flame? To swell the Tide, or press the faint Reflux; White spungy Clouds imbibe the lazy Vapours, And brew a Tempest on the hoary Main? At thy Command do roaring Channels rise, Sweep away Plains, and thunder thro' the Woods? Or can'st thou candy up a Silver Tempest, To cloath the naked Year with Silver Snow? Or treasure up thy stony Magazines, Then pour the fatt'ning War upon the Ground? Dost thou unlock the Bosom of the Spring, When blust'ring Flora languishingly courts Young vernal Zephyr with soft Blandishments? At thy Command does Autumn crown the Year With golden Pride and hoary Majesty? Do all the Seasons their fix'd Stations keep, And dance in mystic Order to thy Word? Say, dost thou paint the Peacock's gaudy Plumes With streaming Azure, and with waving Gold; Here blushing Purples flow in fading Greens, But waving vanish in a golden Breeze: With what majestic Air he stalks along, Struts in his Gait, and spreads his painted Pride? Could then thy Hand create the brinded Lion, That makes thee tremble at his very Voice? Or wilt thou make him (seeing he is strong) To bear thy Burdens, and to be thy Slave? Dost thou direct the rapid Eagle's Wings To sail thro' fluid Fields of floating Air, There with his Beak to souse upon his Prey? Or darting from a Cloud to truss a Serpent, Aloft again he towers his Flight, in vain The hissing Captive whisks his scaly Tail. Dost thou the Courser's rapid Force maintain, With Thunder arm his Neck, his Feet with Lightning? When from afar he hears the Din of Arms, He list'ning stands, he stamps, he pricks his Ears: If stronger Echoes bear the flying Noise, Confus'd with clatt'ring and with rattling Shields, He shoots his Neck to catch the noisy War, And drowns the Thunder with his louder Voice; But if he see the flashing Storm aloof, The fighting Captains, and the flaming War He dims the dazling Splendours of bright Arms, With more incessant Light'ning from his Eye; He fires, he foams, nor hears the Rider's Voice; But leaves his Eye behind the rolling Plain, And bears him in a Tempest on the Foe. AN ELEGY: To the Memory of a Friend, begun in his Sickness. N. B. Mr. Roche recovered, and the Public are obliged to Him for some fine Pieces hereunto annexed. Yet, yet, He lives—O yet kind Heavens spare The dear lamented Object of my Prayer! Vain Hope, vain Wish—else why fresh Sorrows rise, Spring from my Soul, and overflow my Eyes. What chilling Anguish freezes ev'ry Part, Sure tis my Friend just dying from my Heart: Griefs big with Griefs, and Pangs on Pangs deplore My dearest Friend, perhaps my Friend no more. Ill-boding Thought— Hah! from whence streams that melancholy Gloom, Whence groan'd that Echo, from some hollow Tomb 'Tis sure the Call of Death! my Soul attend; Lo! hark! I know the Voice, it cries, my Friend; How pale it looks—but see the Vision o'er, 'Tis he—what Roche! I knew that Form before. It must be so—Yet whence this guilty Fear! Why freeze my Nerves, why bristles ev'ry Hair? Did we thus meet! ah ever friendly stay, What do I wish—alas I faint away. Whence rose my Fears! the fictious Vision's flown, Yet sure, too sure I hear some mournful Groan. Those baleful Eughs that o'er the Window wave, Could their deep Murmurs thus my Sense deceive! Those Mid-night Beams, that pale yon Moon-light Wall; Could they the Image of my Friend recall? Could these Delusions thus disturb my Breast, Startle my Soul, and burst the Bands of Rest? Ah no! those Objects innocent appear, Nor shock my Sight, nor terrify my Ear. But hark! the horary-resounding Bower, Doleful, proclaims the lonesome Mid-night Hour. Now Sleep with downy Wings broods o'er the Ground, While Death wide-stalking shapes his Nightly Round, With Sleep's black Pinions, plumes his Ebon Dart, And dismally beguiles the Slumberer's Heart. Ah me! my Friend, my sickly Friend arise, Death, Death lies ambush'd in the soft Disguise. Torn from the dear Recesses of thy Heart, For ever! ah for ever we must part. Nay, cease to tremble, stop that falling Tear, 'Tis I, my Friend; can I create thy Fear? How we have lov'd, 'tis thou alone canst tell; How we have lov'd, 'tis thou alone canst feel. Yet would I sooth thy doubt-revolving Soul, But Heaven forbids, and angry Tales controul. Nor can Discourse as once beguile the Hours, They're past—my Wish is all—I come, ye Powers. O ever-honour'd! long-lamented Friend, And is it thus our promis'd Joys must end? TO LAURA. In vain my Laura you conceal that Name, When every Verse betrays you into Fame. Raptur'd I read, and as I read, I see Virtue can only be describ'd by Thee. Drest in thy Verse, how beautiful she shines, Charms in thy Thought, and by thy Soul refines. So drawn thro' tuneful Instruments, the Air In Music warbles, and expels Despair. Again, fair Nymph thy Power of Numbers try, And sweeten Sorrow into Harmony. So oft when touch'd with Sickness I repair To draw from fragrant Fields a purer Air: Nature still strives t' amuse my Mind in vain, 'Till Birds wide-warbling melodize the Plain. The sprightly Notes each Sense of Pain controul, And sudden Health revives my fainting Soul. Sooth'd, there I stand, and sweetly lost around, Hear of my Pains, and healthen from the Sound. With Virtue's Charms, my fair Physician prove, And kindly make me such, as you could Love. An Idyllium. Fast by those Banks, where aged Eden A River, so called, which encompasses the Town of Appleby, in Westmorland. glides, And Trees embow'ring paint his azure Sides, Young Florio sat; his Lyre the Muses strung, And to the Streams attun'd the rising Song. The Birds enchanted, as the Poet play'd, Perch'd o'er his Head, and peopled all the Shade. When, lo! descending to the Vocal Grove, Approach'd the Parent, and the Power of Love: Quick at his Sight, the Flowers fresh Sweets exhale, And softer Murmurs dy'd in ev'ry Gale. While thus the God-head spoke. “Say, Shepherd, say, “Still shall thy stubborn Soul disdain my Sway? “Still shalt thou brave my All-subduing Dart, “Nor one sure Arrow pierce thy lawless Heart? “Have I for this subdu'd fam'd Chiefs of Old, “Soften'd the Fierce, and Womaniz'd the Bold? “Shall humbled Monarchs own my mighty Reign, “And thou, a Boy, the Victor-God disdain? To hide his Thoughts, in Silence, Florio strove, Yet even Silence is a Speech in Love: He watch'd th' unguarded Passage to his Heart, And unawares deep lodg'd th' envenom'd Dart. Description of a Shepherd. Piping he sate, as merry as his Look, And by him lay his Bottle and his Crook; His Buskins edg'd with Silver were, of Silk, And sheath'd a Leg more white than Morning Milk. Those Buskins he had got, and brought away, For dancing best upon the Revel Day. The Dissenter. Non-con at Satan in the Pulpit rails, And musters up a Pack of dev'lish Tales: How by Old Nick, Eve was at first betray'd, Uriah's Wife by David backwards laid: But never tells who makes him kiss his Maid. Amoret and Florimello. A Pastoral SONG. I Underneath a mossy Mountain, Close beside a falling Fountain, Charming Amoret was laid; Wanton Zephyrs whisper'd Kisses, Toying with her flowing Tresses, When the sighing Virgin said: II Must I then for-ever languish, With this soft consuming Anguish, O the sadly pleasing Pain! Shame commands me to conceal it, Love commands me to reveal it, To my lovely Shepherd-Swain. III O thou sweetly vocal Water, Cease a harmless Maid to flatter; And convey these dying Sighs, Thro' this Flow'r-enamell'd Valley, To yon fair enchanting Alley, Where asleep my Lover lies. IV Florimello sweetly dreaming, Amoret consenting seeming, Wak'd, and curst the jilting Shade; Swift as Light'ning thro' the Bushes, Half enrag'd the Shepherd rushes, Finds, and clasps the real Maid. To an old Lady who painted. In vain, poor Nymph, to win our youthful Hearts, You purchase Charms, and practise all your Arts. In former Times we heard our Fathers say, Flavia was tender, easy, fair, and gay. Thus may we love each Picture that we view, For that contains as many Charms as you. Once more employ this strange creating Art, And nicely animate each fading Part: Then keep a constant Eye upon your Glass, And be the Picture of what once you was: So shall you gain one half of your Desire, For then, but not till then, we can admire. Upon Zephyrinda's Singing. When Zephyrinda's softest Airs I hear, She draws my Soul into my list'ning Ear; Aghast I stand, unknowing where to praise, Lost in a Maze of Joys ten thousand ways: Sometimes I melt upon her Music's Sound, And bless that charming Tongue that gives the Wound; Sometimes I sighing view those magic Eyes, Where all that's good and all that's lovely lies. Soft panting Cupids play around the Fair, They laugh, they peep, they think their Mother there. But while the charming Zephyrinda sings, They point their Darts, and wave their Silken Wings. Floating on painted Streams they fly around, Languish in Airs, and melt with pleasing Sound. Like her sweet Orpheus sung his fleeting Love, Like Me attentive stood the list'ning Grove. But now no more let Poets Orpheus praise, Or crown his hallow'd Lyre with greener Bays: To Zephyrinda's Airs and sweeter Song, A fairer Fame, and loftier Lays belong; He only made the Hellish-Shades admire; Her Eyes and Music charm the Heavenly-Choir; And thus instructs the Soul to sing and love, At once the Business and the Bliss above. EPIGRAMS. Spoken Extempore to a Lady, upon seeing her Shadow in the Water. What Art can prevail o'er this wonderful Dame? In Water she Burns, and she Freezes in Flame! Upon a Lame Man newly married. George Limpus is lame, yet has gotten a Bride, Since he's lame, he can't Walk—why then he may Ride. Written with a Penknife on a Tree. Whilst thus my Knife inscribes to Fame Fair Rosalanda's Name; Cupid with a keener Dat Carves the Nymph upon my Heart. Upon a Lady's having been at Naples. Like Semele should Cælia try her Charms, Should Jove with equal Ardour fill her Arms; Well might the Nymph revenge the blasted Dame, And fire the Thund'rer with a fiercer Flame. Wrote in a Lady's Pocket-Book. As on these fading Leaves I wrote my Name, Belinda cry'd, her Heart could show the same. The same alas! in ev'ry Point I fear; Eras'd by the next Touch, as this is here. On a Drunkard's writing his Mistress's Name on a Drinking-Glass. While Shallow-Brains scribbles his Phillis's Name, In many a flourishing Letter; 'Tis only that he may Remember the Dame, Lest he should grow drunk, and Forget her. The Quack. Querpo, surrounded by the rabble Rout, Scatter'd his Packets, and his Jokes about; When a poor Fellow, sillier than the rest, Came cringing up, and thus the Quack addrest: Pray, Doctor, if I may but be so bold, Amongst the many strange things you have told, Pray can you tell One how to cure a Scold? For I, my Neighbours know't, have such a Wife! That in plain Terms I'm weary of my Life. The Miser. Old Gripus went to buy a Suit of Clothes, (And to the cheapest Place each Body knows) But thinking that the Merchant was too hard, He fell confounded foul upon the Yard. Is this your Measure, Sir! is this three Foot! As I'm an Alderman, by G? look to't. He said: and waggish Pickthank thus replies, (For all your Tradesmen are most monstrous wise) That it is Measure, Sir, the Cloth I'll lay, And we'll go try it yonder, o'er the way: But let me tell you this before you go, That, were't a Measure for your Conscience, tho' Before such lumping Pen'worths should go down, You'd swear't as long, as all the Yards in Town. From Horace. Turn'd and applied to Chloe. Auream quisquis Mediocritatem Diligit— Let me not be too high, nor yet too low, (Says Horace) that is, keep a just so, so. Then think not that I'll humble to your Foot, Or to your Head on strutting Tiptoe shoot: But on your Middle all my Thoughts employ, For there, I fancy, lies the solid Joy. Upon a Lame, Latin Elegiac, Bard. Tom Hobblestart in Elegiacs writes, But in no other Poetry delights; For This, indeed, he seems cut out by Fate, Witness his rueful Look, and shambling Gait. His Face inspires him with Poetic-Woe, And his unequal Legs the Measure show. Speak Truth and Shame the Devil. Old Olivia wears a Mask, If any one the Reason ask, This, Answer plain, reveals it: Her Face of late's so ugly grown, She does not care to fright the Town, And so forsooth conceals it. Upon One who stiled himself a Great Master of the Easy Poetry. Tom Jingle's Rivers murmur as they go, But cold and weak as native Fountains flow; That they should murmur on, I think it fit; For who could rest contented with their Wit? Another. Dactyl and Squib make Verses as they Go, I cannot wonder then they walk so Slow. On Chloe. Chloe's in every part Divine, Chloe's the Goddess of her Sex: Who'd think that where such Beauties shine, The Nymph could ever Swain perplex? On the same. Chloe the arrant'st Jilt alive, Intolerably vain, Boasting would make us all believe, What Men her Eyes have slain. Poor Fool! their Life they'll soon recover, (Stale-Maidenhead replies,) Ah could you but as well get over The Wounds, they gave between your T?s. Another. Chloe the Wonder of the latter Age, Tho' antiquated does our Hearts engage; With such an Art affects the Wits and Beaus! How like good Wine? by Time she stronger grows. On a Lady's Birth-Day. This Day that gave Belinda Breath, Has giv'n a thousand Youths their Death; Why then fond Youths, so wond'rous gay? Is this a fit rejoicing Day! As well might Priam's Subjects load The Altar of their Guardian-God; As well express untimely Joy, On the great Birth-Day of that Boy, Whom Fate design'd to fire their Troy. TOAST. To fair Belinda crown the sparkling Bowl, And let full Bumpers brighten up the Soul; Yet these small Comforts to my Passion prove, I'd drink an everlasting Draught of Love. Another. You ask me the Nymph that delights me the most, Why—Sir, here's my Service, Belinda's the Toast. Upon the Lord Rochester's Poem on Nothing. Whilst others toil to gain themselves a Name, Wilmot from Nothing gains a greater Fame, Strange! can such Structures out of Nothing rise, And with such wonderful Delight surprize! Thus out of Nothing sprung this beauteous World, By one commanding Word in Order hurl'd. TO CÆLIA. I I'm sure, my Cælia, that you'd smile, Nay laugh to hear me say, That when the Sun shines all the while, I cannot see the Day. II But 'twou'd be more absurd indeed, If to discover your Disguise, I should some borrow'd Lustre need To light me to your Eyes. III Your dazling Eyes the Sun out-shine, Like his their Darts are hurl'd; Like his their Office is divine, To guide a brighter World.</field>
