Gret othes they swore thare. âOf hym wyl we holde euer-more Cordys, the good Cyte.â therof Charlys was glad tho, and all were cristened in a thro, with grete Ioye &amp; solempnite. Welle sone theraftyr come tythyng to Charlys, the Ryche kyng, By a well trwe Messanger, That the kyng of Nauerne Gan to Robbe and to berne, in hys lond bothe fer &amp; nere. Tho Charlys hyt wyst a-fyn, he com to Mount Gardyn, and ther they mette in fere. Eythyr had othyyr be-hy?t, to-gedyr on morowe for to fy?t, In the same stede ther. tho Charlys made an Orysoun, with ryght gode deuocioun, to Ihesu and to Marye: [that] he sende hem grace with-oute fayle, to wete who schulle in bataylle wynne the Maystrye, and who schull be y-slawe, of kny?tys of cristen lawe, In kyng Charlys partye; that euerych that schuld be ded Most bere a croys Red On hys schuldyr on hye. On morwe wanne yt was day, Charlys Rose with gret noblay, And to hys kny?tys cryed to batayle for to fare. thenne sey he moche care Off ten hundred that tyde then was the kyng in grete dolour, and prayed to ten hundred paramour, At the Chapel to abyde; And sayde, ?yf thay with hem went, they schuld be de[d], verament, with the sarisins ful of pride. thay answerd, &amp; askeden why. then sayde Charlys sykerly: ây se on ?ou the sygne of deth, with-oute drede. loke nowe echon on othyrs schulder! a-monge ?ou alle nys none othyr, but beryng the croys Red. for why, y wote thorou? my prayer, that ?e schulle be ded all in fer, ?yf y ?owe with me lede. Ac dwellyth here vith-outen stryf! to-day y schall saue ?our lyfe. to spylle ?ou yt ys no nede.â tho to batayl the kyng gan Ryde, hys good dussypers by hys syde, And faste the ganne to fy?t. Off the sarisins thay slowyn so ?ern, that the kyng tho of Nauerne, A?eyns hem, he had no my?t. Kyng Charlys slowe that day, he &amp; hys Ost, sothe to say, syxty thousand tho ful Ry?t. and whenne he come to the mede, he fonde hys kny?tys al dede, ther he hem left aply?t. By the Ensampyl, whe mowe se, that no man schall hys deth fle for none skynnes nede. Tho all Nauerne Charlys toke In-to hys hende, so saythe the boke, In trewthe, so y nowe Rede; And ?af hyt hys [barownys] saumfayle, that hadde hym holpe in batayle, that dou?ty were of dede. and [hyt] was departyd Amonge hem vchon, and [they] were y-feffyd ther-with anon, to lyue in ioye &amp; pryde. and whenne the kyng Charlemayne hadde y-wonne Nauerne &amp; spayne, and y-slawe the hethen kny?tys, hys Catel &amp; hys Townys, he ?af to hys barownys, and made hem grete lordynges. Portyngale &amp; Nauerne, to the brytons he ?af hyt ?erne, and thus parted hys wynnyngys. Tandylyf, a strong Castel, to the Iercos, he ?aue hyt yche-a-del Ry?t in grete hyynges. And the londe of Galeys, he ?af the frenche men, y-wys. but thay nolde dwelle nou?t thare: thay for-sokyn that ylke Londe, for to haue into her honde, for yt was so dere. In spayne Charlys tok, As y fynde in my boke, all that hethen were, that lyued in false lawe: he dud hem honge and to-drawe, wel fast by the swere. Charlys stabeled for to be An Erchebyschope in that Cyte, ther that sent James lys. And alle the bysschopys in spayne, by the hest of Charlemayne, And Eke in Galys, schulde be vndyr hym. Ac the byschop, syr turpyn, halowed that stede, y-wys, for ther nas arst no Cyte: Charlys hote that ther schuld be Composterne of prys. And in the moneth of y[u]ner, Charlys comaunded fer &amp; nere In Galys &amp; ek in spayne, Ã¾at Eche hous of power, Schulde ?ef twelf penyes a ?er, By the hest of charlemayne, To seynt Iams of Galys, And be quyt of oÃ¾er seruys, Ã¾at hous to sustayne. And so Ã¾ay dude with-oute lete, ffor charlys hyt hade sette, Durst no man be Ã¾er-a-gayne. Here Bygynnyth a Rewful tale, How Rowlond deyde at rouncyuale. Now lete we be of Ã¾ys, And speke we of charlys, Ã¾at muche was of my?t. Off hys lengthe and hys brede, As Clerk ye doth in boke rede, y schal ?ow telle a-ry?t. Twenty fot he was of lengthe, And Ã¾er-to man of gret strength, And a man of sterne sy?t. Blake of here, red of face, Ã¾ere he come in many place, he was a dou?ty kny?t. ffoure tymes in the ?er, vppon hys heued he wolde ber The holy croune of Ã¾orne: At ester, and at Whyt-sontyde, At seynt Iames day with pride, And at Ã¾e tyme Ã¾at god was Borne, At the mete in Ã¾e halle, among hys kny?tes alle, with drawe swerd hym by-forne. That ys in Ã¾e maner ay, and schal be tyl domes-day, Off Emperour Ã¾at ys corne. Where-so he slepe a-ny?t, wyse he was as felle to hys ry?t, And Euer douted tresoun. An hundred kny?tes schulde hym kepe, were Ã¾at euer he schuld slepe,â kny?tes Off grete renoun. And Euerych dou?thy kny?t hold a torche brennyng bry?t, And a nakyd fachoun. Thus Ã¾e kyng charlys lay, with hys ost many a day In the cite of pampuloun. Twey sarsins tho of spayne were y-sent to charlemayne, with hym for to be. The sawdan of babylonye, he sent hem to paumpylayne, ffram perce, the ryche cite. Mansour, hy?t that other, And beligans, hys brother, That was of gret puste. Thay dwelled there long whyle, kyng charlys to by-gyle, whenne thay my?t here tyme se. Charlys by-thou?t hym tho, That thay ne scholde nou?t dwelle so, But thay cristen were. He sent to hem sone A kny?t in-to Aragone, Gwynes, a dussyper. But charlys wyst nou?t The tresoun of gwynes thou?t, The wykked fals messanger. ffor-soth he hath hys way y-nome, To mansure that he ys come And sayde that charlys hem grette. he sayde that hys brother and he Scholde for-sothe y-cristened be, with-outen any lette. Mansure was full fel, And made a ryche Ieuel. fforth he lete it fette, And ?af the messanger; And sette hym to the soper. wel fayre for-sothe thay hym grette! Mansure tok tho Gwynes And sayde to hym thus: âI pray the, Gwynes, lysten to me! ?yf thou wylt charlys for-sake, And to my consayle take, ffull ryche schal tou be. Thrytty somers and ?ut mo, Bothe of syluer and gold also, ffor-sothe y wylle ?eue the.â Thoru? that ylke tresour, Gwynes by-come traytour. Euyl mote he the! Thenne dyuysed Gwynes, That he wolde sey thus, To the kyng charlemayn, That mansour and belygauns wolde come in-to ffraunce,â There-to thay were boun. And mansure there-whyle GraÃ¾ed hys ost with gyle To sle hym with tresoun. Charlys was wel a-payede, And to Gwynes tho sayde, âThow art a good baroun!â Tho was mansoure glad, That the treson was y-mad, And ?af that traytour, Thrytty somers and mo Off gold and syluer also, with swythe gret honour. And thrytte stedes with gold fyn To charlys sent that sarsin,â Alle they were whyt a[s]flour,â And an houndred tonne of wyn, That was bothe good and fyn, And swythe fayre colour. Gwynes hys leue tok, And went hym hom, so sayth the bok, wyth that presaunt so ryche, And sayde, âsyre charlys,â tho, âMansure wylle come the to Ry?t wel blythelyche: for-sothe hys brother and ek he wyllyn bothe y-cristened be with here folk, lytell and muche.â ffor-sothe Gwynes tho was A fals traytour as was Iudas, And many mo be?t suche. Charlys grethed hym to wende To fraunce with hys kny?tes hende, By the traytours rede. There he fond fomen fale In the forest off runcyvale, That wolde hym do to dede. The kyng bad roulond, hys cosyn, Twenty thousand to take with hym, Stouttelyche for to lede. Whenne ch[arly]s hadde y-hote tho, The best bodyes that were tho with roulond, for-sothe, thay ?ede. Twenty thousand, charlys ladde And also fele roulond hadde, In-to the rere batayle. Charlys ne tok no dussyper, But Gwynes and turpyn, y-fer, That weren of hey?e parayle. Mansoure lete tho passe Charlys folk, bothe more and lasse, ffor-sothe, with-outen fayle: Tho com roulond with hys ost, And mansoure with muche bost Hard hym gan assayle. Syxty thousand and ek mo, Mansoure with hym brou?t tho, Out of the wode a-ply?t. The cristen thay gonne assayle, Many deyde in that batayle, Or it euer were ny?t. To-gyder thay gonne smyte, Neyther ne spared other but lyte, There was a wel gryslych sy?t. Roulond was there y-slawe, And good olyuer, hys felawe, And wel many a trewe kny?t. Syre constantyn of gret rome A-?eynes belyngas, for-sothe, come with a gret spere keruyng; And to hym he it bare, he brast it on peses thare, with-outen any lesyng. with swerd and with mas, ffor-sothe, in that plas, To-gedyr thay hem thryng. Ihesu crist, kyng of blys, lord with-outen mys, here soules to heuene bryng! whenne oger Denys seye thys, That hys good felaw y-slawe ys, In hert hym was full who. he fau?t as he were wood, That alle a-?eyn hym stod, To grounde he fylle hem tho. Raynold of auby-despyne Com prekyng on a stede fyne, And fau?t ful hard also. wel sone the cristen were by-set, As der that be?th with-Inne the net, with ten thousand and mo. Thay fau?ten wel by the lawe, But sone thay were alle y-slawe, with-Inne a lytel stounde. Men seyeth in old sawe, That ten men in a lytel thrawe Mowe be brou?t to grownd. thou? Oger fau?t fast, ?ut sone at the laste, he hadde dethys wounde, and Raynold wyth also, &amp; wel many a gode kny?t mo, In boke as hyt ys fownde. tho syr bertram, the baner, bothe Rouland, and eke Olyuer, and syr Gaumfres, the kyng, Gonne tho to fy?t ful fast, And al to ground tey caste, wel many a gret lordyng. ffor-soth, Olyuer, and roulond tho, Cleuen men and hors a-towo, So Ã¾ay fau?t in Ã¾at Ã¾ryng. Syre bertram, Ã¾e baner, Bothe roulond and Olyuer Ne spared elde ne ?ong. fful sone after in a stounde, Gaufres was brou?t to grounde, with the cursed sarisins. Ã¾o good Olyuer was slawe Ã¾o, and many a dou?ty kny?t also, with Ã¾e deueles lemes. A sarsyn, Ã¾at hy?t laugelye, he com with gret enuye, As y ?ow say in rymes, he com and smot Olyuer on Ã¾e croune, That bothe hys ey?en fyl a-down, ffram hym in Ã¾at tymes. Whenne Ã¾at Olyuer was blynd, Bothe by-fore and Ek by-hynde, he leyde faste a-boute; and euer more as he rod, he made a way SwyÃ¾e brod, Off the sarisins Ã¾at were stoute. And as he fau?t wondurlyche fast, Roulond com ate last, To helpe hym saun doute. So hard Olyuere smot roulond, Ã¾at hys schyld from hym wond, A-mong Ã¾e heÃ¾en route. âallas,â sayde Roulond Ã¾o, âOlyuer, why faryst Ã¾u so? Artou paynym by-come?â âNay,â sayde Olyuer, âgod it wot! y ne wyst neuer when y smot, My sy?t ys me by-nome.â Ã¾o Ã¾ay bothe layden on in fere, Bothe roulond and Olyuer, And slowyn Ã¾ere many a yom. with Ã¾at com laugelye,â Ã¾e cours haue he of oure ladye, Ã¾at most hath myrÃ¾es mone! And with a spere swythe feloun Ã¾at dede he fyl to grounde. Ã¾o roulond sey Ã¾at fy?t, with sorow and care he smot a kny?t,â That same heÃ¾en hound,â That hors an man boÃ¾e at onys, he euene cleued hys body and bonys. Ne my?t no man hym hele Ã¾at wounde! BoÃ¾e Gaufer and gaufres, Ry?t be-syde Oger denys, Ã¾ere lay y-slaw Ã¾at stounde. Anguler, and anastes Ã¾ere, And syr yuory, here gode ser, alle quyk Ã¾ay were y-nome, and y-honged hey?e on a tre, Ã¾at grete dele it was to se, Vppon many a cristen gom. Ã¾ere-fore mansoure was ful fawe, Ã¾at Ã¾ay were so alle y-slawe, Ã¾e cristen, boÃ¾e alle and sum. But roulond skaped a-way, In a busk of an hegge for-soth to say with hys thrydde gome. And as roulond, Ã¾e good kny?t, com framward Ã¾at strong fy?t, A sarsin Ã¾er he fand, Ã¾at rested hym Ã¾ere vp-ry?t, y say for-soÃ¾e a-ply?t, with foure wythys bond. so vp-ry?t by a tre, he ?ede forth and let hym be styll for to stonde, And went vppon an hey?e hylle, And hys horn he blew wel sch[r]ylle, That he held in hys honde. The cristen gonne it knowe, That weren a-way y-flowe, And comyn to hys cry. wel an hundred on a drowe, A-?eyneward gonne drawe, To the sarsins sykerly. Roulond hys swerd gan drawe, To the sarsin, he sayde in a thrawe, âA-none thow schalt deye, But thow me telle, y-wys, Where mansoure, thy lord, ys. bey me hastlye! âThenne wyl y saue the. My treuth y the ply?t!â The sarsin was blythe, To askape with hys lyue, And sayde, âGo we a-none ry?t!â fforth thay went, alle prest, Bothe to-gederes in that forest, So faste as thay my?t. The sarsin sayde, âhe ys thys That bereth the schylde of prys with a dragoun of gold bry?t.â Roulond mette an hathen hounde, Suche a strok he hym founde, That ded he fyll in that plas. hard he layde on bothe syde. whome roulond mette in that tyde, hym by-fyll a sory cas. Mansure he mette saunfayle, In that same batayle, As it was goddys grace. Roulond let tho the sarsin gone, And to the batayle he went a-none, There mansure in was. Strong fy?t was hem by-twene, They al to-hewen the helmes schene, And here schyldes dude also. Thoru? the hauberk, the blod was sene, ffor the strokys weren ful kene, That deled were by-twene hem to. Roulond smot a strok with yre, On the helm of syre mansure, And clef hys body tho. welle a thousand sarsins, Alle of godys wytherlyngges, Thay flowyn a-way hym fro. whenne belyngans, hys brother, Sey that hit was none other, he fleye with hys ost To saragous, that ryche cyte, Bothe he and eke hys mayne, with bobaunce and with bost. Roulond had so many a wounde,â wondyr that he ne fyl to grounde,â And than was sorw most. âGod,â he cryed, âmercy blyue!â lord, help hym in hys lyue, Astou art the holy gost! Roulond com doun a-none, Off febelnesse he hadde gret wone. with that come syre baudewyne, And terry also with-outen fayle, That weren a-skaped from that batayle. That on was hys owyn cosyn. he seye hys armur al to-tore, hys body with speres thoru? bore, hys lyf in poynt to tyne. Roulond throw out dorundale, And sayde there a rewfull tale, And wroth was in fyn. Tho he by-gan to make hys mone, And faste loked there-vppone, As he it held in hys hond: âO swerd of gret my?t, Better bar neuer no kny?t, To wynne with no lond! Thow hast y-be in many batayle, That neuer sarsin saumfayle Ne my?t thy strok with-stonde! Go, let neuer no paynym In-to batayle bere hym, After the deth of roulond! O Swerd of gret power, In thys world nys nou?t thy per, Of no metal y-wrou?t! Alle spayne and Gales Thoru? grace of god &amp; the, y-wys, To cristendom ben brou?t. Thow ert good withouten blame, In the ys graued the holy name, That alle thyng made of nou?t.â Roulond smot it on a stone, And he it karf a-to a-none. To breke it tho was hys thou?t. Tho he hadde that ston y-schorne, wel lowde he blew tho hys horne, To haue y-had more socour. Thre note he blew so, That hys horn clef a-two, That was of good yuour, That the temple and hys vayne Brost bothe with gret mayne, Off roulond, the conquerour. Syxty myle men herde the soun, Tho the kyng charlys of renoun Made gret dolour: â?yue y can Roulond knowe, Ry?t now for-sothe y herde hym blowe, y drede lest he mysfare. As armes a-none, gret and smale, To that forest of rouncyvale, To loke ?yf he be thare!â Gwynes, that wyst of thys dede, To the kyng a-none he sayde, âSyre, haue ?e no care! Roulond ys so iolyf a man, That he hys blewyng by-gan, ffor huntyng of an hare.â lo, thys falce traytour, God ?eue hym myssauntour ffor hys falce lesyng! Rowlond now lyth on the gras, And Baudewyn with hym was, And schulde hym water bryng. To fecche hym water he gan gon, But he ne my?t fynde none, ffor none skynnes thyng. Tho he tolde that there none was, Roulond sayde, âallas! allas!â with swythe gret mornyng. To fecche eft ?ede baudewyn: with that there come a sarsin, There that lay roulond, And tok that swerd, dorundale, And thus he sayde in hys tale, As he it held on hond: âO Dorundale, thou art wel founde! wyth the hath roulond y-brou?t t grounde, Many a sarsin of oure lond. Now schal many a cristen berd wynne schame here after-ward, Thoru? help of mahoundys honde.â Whenne roulond herd hym speke so, In hys hert hym was ful wo, And hastylyche vp he stert. he ?ede a-non to Ã¾at paynym, and with hys horn he smot hym, Ã¾at he ffelle ouer-Ã¾wart, That blod and brayn start vp by-forn. ffor-sothe hys lyf Ã¾ere was lorn, That he nas neuer after quart. Ded he fel, so sayÃ¾ my tale. ffor he wolde haue stolyn dorundale, he hadde a stroke ful smert. with Ã¾at cam baudewyn a-none a-gayn, And fond Roulond on Ã¾e playn, he leyde hym on hys stede, Swerd and horn he tok also; As man Ã¾at was in muche wo, Away he gan hym lede. Out of Ã¾at forest of rouncyvale, In-to an oÃ¾er dep dale, and leyde hym a-mede, And sayde, âroulond, pur charite, Ã¾enk on god in trinite, Ã¾at for ous wolde blede!â with Ã¾at roulond, godys kny?t, loked vp to heuene ly?t, And sayde on hys maner. âIhesu, Ã¾at syttyth in trinite, O god &amp; persones Ã¾re, Now here my prayer! y com to thys contre, Lord, for Ã¾e loue of Ã¾e, And thy moder dere, Ã¾e hethen for to slo, That wrou?t Ã¾e so muche wo, whyle Ã¾at Ã¾u were here. lord, as Ã¾u art kyng y-corne, let Ã¾u me be nou?t for-lorne, But bryng me to blys, Ã¾ere Ã¾at ys Ã¾y reynyng!

Thoru? mansures rede, Alle hys folk were dede, And y-spylt in that plas. Tho charlys wust thys, he was ful sory, y-wys, And sayde, âallas, allas!â with dwele and muche crye, Charlys went in hye, Roulond for to se; And fond hym there ded, And thus to hym he sayde, As y schal telle the: âO roulond, the good conquerour, And the noblyst warryour, That euer-more schal be!

Tho turpyn was by-set, As a der in the net, There a-mong the paynemes, And ney? y-slawe that stounde, And hadde many a wounde, Of the falce sarsins. Off strokes hard and sore, Turpyn suffred thare, Off godys wytherlynges. And turpyn and tybaut Made a swythe noble sau?t, To slen the fyndes lemes. Thay and here ost fau?ten so, That syxty thousand and mo Suffred there dedes wounde. Grete peple thay gonne sle: And wenten fele in-to the se, ffor drede of deth that stounde. No sarsin, syker a-ply?t, ffrom that Batayle skapyn my?t, That owher my?t be founde. Alle they were y-slawe, And y-brou?t of here lyue-dawe, There vppon the grounde. And euer schon the sonne bry?t, To ?eue kyng charlys ly?t, In that fayre fyrmement, Thre dayes of mowntans ry?t, tylle he hadde y-wonne the fy?t, thoru? grace that god hym sent. And he slowe alle hys Enemys, And worschyplyche he wan the pris, wyth swythe gode entent. the kyng was tho glad &amp; blythe, and thonked god many sythe, for the grace that he had hym sent. Anon there-aftyr, he toke the way, ther that Rowlandys body lay, and with hym many a kny?t. âfor-sothe,â sayd Turpyn &amp; Turry, âGwynes hath made thys sekerly, And thys fals tresoun hath dy?t.â tho the kyng Charlyoun Commawndyd swythe anone, to brynge hym forthe anon-ry?t. Terry to hym anone forthe wonde, And of the deth of Rowlond, he hym with-clepyd aply?t, And sayde, âthorugh thy false tresoun Many a gode lorde ys brou?t adown, And hathe suffryd dedes wownde.â Gwynes sayd, ânay, thowe lyxt falsly by thys day, And that schall be well y-fownde, thy body anone-ry?tys to myn! Arme the anon wel afyn! And y wyth a spere y-grownde, But y me defende, y grawnt, so god me amende, Be honged and drawe thys stownde.â Anone Turry, the gode kny?t, Armed hym wel aply?t, And Gwynes dude also. thay come bothe into the felde, Bothe with spere &amp; with schelde. to-gedyr thay reden tho. Gwynes smote turry, that hys schylde sykerly Euene Clef a-too. Turpyn &amp; Charlys the kyng, Bothe thay say that fy?tyng. In hert hem was ful wo! But Turry with hys half Schylde, To Gwynes rod in the felde, with a grete Rawndoun. he ?afe the Traytour suche a wownde that down he fel to grownde, wyth Crystys Malysoun. ther the traytour was ouercome, And swythe anone he was y-nome. By the hest of Charlyoun. And ther he was by-knowe, By-fore heye &amp; eke lowe, Of that ylke false tresoun,â the Crystyn, howe he solde for thrytty somers of golde to her enomys. âfor-sothe,â sayd Charlys, âhyt ys the lawe That thow be honged an drawe, By crist and sent denys.â he tolde that mansure and belygans, how thay schulde haue come in-to fraunce, And haue y-wone the prys, And haue y-slaw kyng charlys, Turpyn, and alle hys barounes, Ry?t at here dyuys. Tho by the heste of charlys the kyng, The traytour was don to hongyng, And was y-drawe thoru? the toun, And after y-honged wel faste. ffor-sothe tho in haste, Alle quyk he was leten doun, And y-bounde to a stake, And hys bowels out y-take, To brenne hym by-forn. To foure stedys he was y-knyt, By the hondys and by the fet, At the heste of charlyoun: On eche stede sat a kny?t, And thus he was to-twyt, Gwynes, the falce traytour. ffor-sothe, hit were skele and ry?t That euerych traytour were so y-dy?t, And hadde muche myssaunter. Charlys tok hys kny?tes, And went to roulond a-none-ry?tes with Swythe gret dolour. Roulondys body he let dy?t, with murre and baune a-none-ry?t, with swythe good odour. Bothe roulond, &amp; olyuer, And euerych of the dussyper with baune weren y-dy?t. Of some with-oute fayle, Men duden out the entrayle, And in lede layde hem a-ry?t. And tho that weren nou?t so, fful wel in salt men dude hem do, To be swete bothe day &amp; ny?t. Thus thay weren dy?t a-none,â wel ynoynted euerychone,â with-outen any vnry?t. Thus charlys doth, that ys so hende, To bryng hys kny?tes to good ende, ffor-sothe as hym thou?t best. Other lordys that weren there, Men layde hem on hors bere, And [they] were rychelyche brou?t in cheste. Charlys by-syde runcyvale lete rere a chyrche good with alle, ffor hem to rede and syng. Now ihesu crist in trinite, O god and persones thre, To ioye and blysse ous bryng! Here endeth otuel, Roulond, &amp; Olyuer, And off the twelf dussypers, That deyden in the batayle off Runcyvale. Ihesu Lord, heuene kyng, To hys blysse ous and hem bothe bryng, To Leuen wyth-oute bale. Amen. quod I. [Gage].</field>
