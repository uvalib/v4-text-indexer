      <field name="fulltext">Here followeth the Booke of Nurture and Schoole of good manners for man and for Chylde. Al ye that wysdom seeke to learn, and would be called wyse: Obedience learn you in your youth, in age auoyde you vyce. I am full blynde in Poets Arte, thereof I can no skill: All elloquence I put apart, following myne owne wyll. Corrupt in speeche be sure am I, my breefes from longes to know, And born and bred in Deuonshyre to as playne my tearmes doe show. Take the best, and leaue the worst, of truth I meane no yll: The matter is not curyous, the intent good, marke it well. Pardon I aske if I offend, thus boldly now to wryte: To Mayster, seruaunt, yong and olde, I doe this booke commit. Requyring friendly youth and age, if any doe amis. For to refourme and hate abuse, and mend where neede there is. Set your yong people forth with spede good manners for to learne: Unto your Elders gentle be, agaynst them say no harme. If youth doe euill their Parentes sure, reape this reporte full soone: They that should teach other folkes good, belyke themselues haue none. A good Father, good children makes, grace being them within: For as they be vsed in youth, in age they will begin. He that good manners seemes to lack, no wyse man doth set by. Wythout condicions vertuous, thou art not worth a flye. Reuerence to thy parentes deare, so duety doth thee bynde: Such children as vertue delight, be gentle, meeke, and kynde. Agaynst thy Parentes multiplye, no wordes but be demure: It will redowne vnto thy prayse, and to thy friends pleasure. A plant without moysture sweete, can bring forth no good flower: If in youth ye want vertue, in age ye shall lack honour. Fyrst dread you God, and flye from sin, earthly thinges are mortall: Be thou not hawty in thy lookes, for pryde will haue a fall. Ryse you earely in the morning, for it hath propertyes three: Holynesse, health, and happy welth, as my Father taught mee. At syxe of the clocke, without delay, vse commonly to ryse: And giue God thanks for thy good rest when thou openest thyn eyes. Pray him also to prosper thee, and thyne affayres in deede: All the day after assure thy selfe, the better shalt thou speede. Or from thy chamber thou doe passe, see thou purge thy nose cleane: And other fylthy thinges lyke ease, thou knowest what I meane. Brush thou, and spunge thy cloaths to, that thou that day shalt weare: In comly sorte cast vp your Bed, lose you none of your geare. Make cleane your shoes, &amp; combe your head, and your cloathes button or lace: And see at no tyme you forget, to wash your hands and face. Put on clothing for thy degree, and cleanly doe it make: Bid your fellow a good morrow, or you your way forth take. To friends, father and mother, looke that ye take good heede: For any haste them reuerence, the better shalt thou speede. Dread the curse of Parents thyne, it is a heauy thing: Doe thou thy duety vnto them, from thee contempt doe flyng. When that thy parents come in syght, doe to them reuerence: Aske them blessing if they haue, bene long out of presence. Cleanly appoynt you your array, beware then of disdayne: Be gentle then of speech ech tyde, good manners doe retayne. As you passe by in towne or streete, sadly go forth your way: Gase you, ne scoffe, nor scold, with man nor chyld, make ye no fray. Fayre speech gets grace, &amp; loue showes well alwayes a gentle blood: Foule speech deserues a double hate, it prooues thou canst small good. When that thou comest to the Church, thy prayers for to say: See thou sleepe not, nor yet talke not, deuoutly looke thou pray: Ne cast thyne eyes to ne fro, as thinges thou wouldst still see: So shall wyse men iudge thee a foole, and wanton for to bee. When thou are in the Temple see, thou do thy Churchly workes: Heare thou Gods word with diligence craue pardon for thy factes. When those thinges you haue done, repayre you to your dinner: Draw home to your maysters presence there doe your true indeuour. If it be your hap, to serue to syt, or eate meate at the Table: Enclyne to good maners, and to nurture yourselfe inable. And if your soueraygne cast you, wyth him to dyne or sup: Giue him preheminence to begin, of meate, and eake of Cup. And of this thing beware I wish, prease not thy selfe to hye: Syt in the place appoynted thee, for that is curtesye: And when thou arte set, and Table couered thee before: Pare not thy nayles, fyle not the cloth, see thou obserue this lore. And if thy mayster speake to thee, take thy cap in thy hande: If thou syt at meate, when hee talketh to thee, see thou stande. Leane not asyde when thou shalt speke vpright be thou standing: Hold still thy hands, moue not thy feete beware thou of tryfling. Stand sadly in telling thy tale, whensoeuer thou talkest: Tryfle thou with nothing, st?d vpright whensoeuer thou speakest. Thwart not thou with thy fellow, nor speake wyth hye voyce: Poynt not thy tale with thy fynger, vse thou no such fond toyes. Haue audyence when thou speakest, speake with authoritye: Else if thou speake of wisedomes lore, little will it auayle thee. Pronounce thy speeche distinctly, see thou marke well thy worde: It is good hearing of a Chylde, beware wyth whome ye borde. Talke not to thy soueraygne deare, no tyme when he doth drinke, When he speaketh, giue audyence, and from him doe not shrinke. Before that you doe syt see that, your knyues be made bright: Your hands cleane, your nayles parde it is a goodlye sight. When thou shalt speake to any man, role not to fast thyne eye: Gase thou not to and fro as one, thats voyde of curtesye. For a mans countenaunce ofte tymes, discloseth still his thought: His lookes with his speeche trust thou me will iudge him good or nought. Looke that your knyfe be sharp &amp; kene to cut your meate withall: So the more cleanlyer be sure, cut your meate you shall: Or thou put much bread in thy pottage looke thou doe it assay: Fill not thy spoone to full, least thou loose somewhat by the way. If any man eate of your dish, crom you therein no Bread: Lest that your hands be found sweaty thereof take ye good heede: They maye be corrupt, that causeth it, for it is no fayre vsage: Of bread flyce out fayre morsels, to put into your pottage. Fill it not to full of bread, for it may be reprooueable: Least that thou leaue parte, for then to measure thou arte varyable. And suppe not lowde of thy Pottage, no tyme in all thy lyfe: Dip not thy meate in the Saltseller, but take it with thy knyfe. When thou haste eaten thy Pottage, doe as I shall thee wish. Wype cleane thy spone I do thee reed, leaue it not in the dish. Lay it downe before thy trenchoure, thereof be not afrayde: And take heede who takes it vp, for feare it be conuayde. Cut not the best peece for thy selfe, leaue thou some parte behynde: Bee not greedye of meate and drinke, be liberall and kynde. Burnish no bones with thy teeth, for that is vnseemely: Rend not thy meate asunder, for that swarues from curtesy. And if a straunger syt neare thee, euer among now and than: Reward thou him with some daynties shew thy selfe a Gentleman. If your fellow sit from his meate, and cannot come thereto: Then cutte for him such as thou haste, he may lyke for thee doe. Belche thou neare to no mans face, with a corrupt fumosytye: But turne from such occasyon friend, hate such ventositye. Eate you small morsels of meate, not to great in quantitye: If ye lyke such meates, yet follow not euer your owne fantasye. Defyle not thy lips with eating much, as a Pigge eating draffe: Eate softly, and drinke manerly take heede you doe not quaffe. Scratche not thy head with thy fyngers, when thou arte at thy meate: Nor spytte you ouer the table boorde, see thou doest not this forget. Pick not thy teeth with thy Knyfe, nor with thy fyngers ende: But take a stick or some cleane thyng, then doe you not offende. If that your teeth be putrifyed, methinke it is no right: To touch the meate other should eate, it is no cleanly sight. Pick not thy handes I thee requyre, nor play not with thy knyfe: Keepe still thy hands and feete also, at meate tyme vse no stryfe. Wype thy mouth wh? thou shalt drink Ale, Beare, or any Wyne: On thy Napkin thou must wype styll, and see all thing be cleane. Blow not your nose on the napkin, where you should wype your hande: But clense it in your handkercher, then passe you not your hand. Wyth your napkyn you may oft wipe and make your mouth full cleene: Some thing that thou canst not espye of others may be seene. Fill not thy trenchour I thee rid, with morsels great and large: Cram not thy mouth to full, ne yet, thy stomack ouercharge. But temper thon thy selfe with drinke so keepe thee from blame: Dronkennesse hurteth thy honestye, and hyndreth thy good name. Keepe thou thy selfe from all excesse, both in meate and in drinke: And euer vse thou temperaunce, whether you wake or wynke. Fyll not thy mouth to full, leaste thou, perhaps of force must speake: Nor blow not out thy crums, when thou doest eate. Fowle not the place with spitting, whereas thou doest syt: Least it abhore some that syt by let reason rule thy wyt. If thou must spit or blow thy nose, keepe thou it out of sight: Let it not lye vpon the ground, but treade thou it out right. Wyth bones &amp; voyd morsels, fyll not, thy trenchour my friend full: Auoyde them into a Uoyder, no man will it anull. Roll not thy meate wythin thy mouth that euery man may it see: But eate thy meate somewhat close, for it is honestye. If that thy Soueraigne profer thee, to drinke once twyse, or thryse: Take it gently at his hand, in Court it is the guyse. When thou hast dronke, straighte set it downe or take it his seruaunt: Let not thy mayster set it downe, then is it well I warrant. Blow not thy Pottage, nor Drinke, for it is not commendable: For if thou be not whole of thy body, thy breath is corruptable. Cast not thy bones vnder the Table, nor none see thou doe knack: Stretch thee not at the Table, nor leane not forth thy back. Afore thy meat, nor afterward, with knyfe scortche not the Boorde: Such toyes are not commendable: trust thou me at a woorde. Leane not vpon the Boord when that your mayster is thereat: For then will all your Elders thinke, you be with him Iackmate. Be not ashamed to eate the meate, which is set before thee: Mannerly for to take it friend, agreeth with curtesye. Cast not thyne eyes to, ne yet fro, as thou werte full of toyes: Use not much wagging with thy head it scarce becommeth boyes. Scratch not thy head, nor put thou not thy fynger in thy mouth: Blow not thy nose, nor looke thereon, to most men it is loath. Be not lowde where you be, nor at the Table where you syt: Some men will deeme thee dronken, mad, or else to lack thy wit. When meate is taken quyte a waye, and voyders in presence: Put you your trenchour in the same, and all your resydence. Take you with your napkin and knyfe the croms that are fore thee. In the Uoyder your Napkyn leaue, for it is curtesye. Be gentle alway, and glad to please, be it night or daye: Wyth tongue nor hand, no rygor vse, let reason rule alwaye. When that the meate is taken vp, and the Table cloath made cleane: Then giue good eare to heare some grace, to washe your selfe demeane. And whyle that grace is saying friend looke that ye make no noyse: And thanke you God for your good fare, him as your soueraigne prayse. When ye begin from boorde to ryse, say to your fellowes all: Much good do it ye gently, then they curteous will ye call. Then goe you to your Soueraygne, giue him obeysaunce duely: That done withdraw your selfe asyde at no tyme prooue vnruely. If ye see men in counsell set, prease not to come to neare: They will say that you are vntaughte, if you to them giue eare. Whysper not thou with thy fellowes oft, giue thou no euill language: Men are suspicious found, and wyll, thinke it no good vsage. Laugh not to much at the Table, nor at it make no game: Uoyde slaunderous and bawdy tales, vse them not for shame. Or thou be olde, beware I rid, least thou doe get a fall: If ye be honest in your youth, in age ye may be lyberall. For the wayting Seruaunt. If ye will be a Seruingman, with attendaunce doe begin: Fyrst serue God, then the worlde, and euer flye from sinne. Apparell thee after thy degree, youth should be cleane by kynde: Pryde and disdayne goes before, and shamefastnes behynde. Aquaynte your selfe with honest men, that are in authorytye: Of them may you learne in youth to auoyde all necessitye Still search thou must for friendship pure, and beware of flattery: With lewde persons I thee counsell, haue no familyaryty. Beholde not thy selfe in thy Apparell, in church, ne in Streete: To gase on thy selfe men will thinke, it is a thing vnmeete. Crye, ne yet speake with to lowd voyce whereas thou doest walke: For lyght witted or dronken sure, men will name thee in talke. Be not thou slothfull, for it is the gouernour of all vyce: Nor be enuyous to any, for then ye be not wyse. Please thy friends, delight not in sloth, that Uyce wasteth goods It dulleth wits, ranckleth flesh and palleth ofte fresh bloods. If you come to another mans house to sporte, and to playe: If the goodman be set at meate, returne, and go your way. If case thou be aduaunced friend, and plaste in high degree: Be lyberall and gentle found, beloued shalt thou bee. Be not to liberall nor to scant, vse measure in eche thing: To get in one yeare, and spend it in another, is no lyuing. It is better to saue somewhat, with good prouysion: Then to wish agayne for that is spent, for that doth breede deuysion. Measure expence, spend warily, and flye farre from excesse: Inough is a feast, more then ynough, is counted foolishnesse. A dilligent seruaunt taking payne, for his mayster truth to show: No doubt his mayster will consyder, and agayne for him doe. A mayster will know where he is, and sometyme for his pleasure: A seruaunt to suffer in anger, to his mayster is a treasure. A seruaunt not reformable, that takes to his charge no heede: Ofte tymes falleth to pouertye, in wealth he may not byde. Be manly at neede, begin no quarrell, in wrong, ne yet in right: A iust quarrell defendes it selfe, in wrong doe not fyght. Forbeare if thou mayst, if any will stryke, then take thou heede: Defend thy selfe, the law will aquyte thee, if thou stand in neede. A man of his handes with hastynesse, should at no tyme be fylde: Auoyde murther, saue thy selfe, play the man being compelde. Be seruiceable and cleanly, and neuer sweare thou oath: Be wyse, ready, and well aduysed, for tyme tryeth thy troth: If case thou be not faythfull found, and in all thinges trusty. Thou doest thy mayster no worship, nor thy selfe honesty. Be not checkmate with thy mayster, for one word giue not fower: Such a seruaunt contynueth to long, if he passe but one hower. Few wordes in a seruannt wyse, deserueth commendation, Such Seruauntes as be of to muche speeche, are yll of operation. Be not to bold with men that be, aboue thee in degree: In age, byrth, or substance, learne thou to handfast honesty. Take payne in youth, be quick, attendaunt be and wyse: Be dilligent, for to detecte, a seruaunt gyuen to vyce. Put thou thy mayster to no payne, by fraude nor fayned subtiltie: Wyse men will say little and suffer, to see thy iniquitie. A man that sayth little, shall perceiue, by the speeche of another: Be thou stil and see, the more shalt thou perceyue in another. Gouerne thou well thy tongue and let thy wordes not mayster thee: If ye follow wyll, ye are lyke, ne to thryue beleeue mee. Obstinacy is follye in, them that should haue reason: They that will not knowe howe to amend, their wits be very geason. In displeasure forbeare thy fellow, lay all mallice apart: Nor meddle not with such as you, know to be ouerthwart, A hasty or wilfull Mayster, that ofte chaungeth seruaunt, And a seruaunt of fleeting, lack wit and wysdome I warrant. Chaunge not ofte thy seruyce, for it sheweth a seruaunte to light: He careth for no man, nor none for him in wrong nor in right. A plyaunt seruaunt gets fauour, to his great aduauntage: Promoted shall he be, in offyce or fee, easiler to lyue in age. Use honest pastyme, talke or syng, or some Instrument vse: Though they be thy betters, to heare, they will thee not refuse, To prate in thy maysters presence, it is no humanitye: But to speake when he talketh to thee, is good curtesye. For your preferment resorte to such as may you vauntage: Among Gentlemen, for their rewards, to honest dames for maryage. See your eye be indifferent, among women that be fayre: And if they be honest, to them boldly then doe repayre. Honest quallityes and gentle, many men doth aduaunce: To good maryages trust me, and their names doth inhaunce. Of worldly pleasure it is a treasure to say truth: To wed a gentle wyfe, of his bargayne he needes no ruth. What is most trouble to man, of all thinges that be lyuing: A curst wyfe shortneth his lyfe, and bringeth on his ending. Women nyse, and not wyse, waketh men when they should take sleepe: Lyke a feather in the weather, of such I take no keepe. Fulgentius declareth, vpon the maryage in Cana Galile: The condicions of men and women, aparte I will shew ye. He lykeneth Christ to a good man, the Authour of verity. To rule himselfe, and in all thinges, to obey to man truely. He lykeneth a good woman, to the myrrour of humillitye. In them is roted pacience, sound fayth loue, and charitye. Fayth and trust in good women both, in eche deede, and in woorde: Louing God, obeying their husbands, cleane at bed and at boorde. Lykened women to ydols, taken for Gods, yet were Deuils: Iudge so of women which be corrupte with such euils. Women to blame, or yet defame, I will disprayse none: Say as ye list, women are yll to trust, all thinges but one. Fayre and good are two quallityes, scantly in one body seene: Fayrenesse is soone seene, her pacience and goodnesse is yll to deeme. For to saue, that a man would haue, is at large without a keeper: Who can stay, that will away or without restraynt let her. To wed a woman, that is good, fayre, and eke wyse, Is to haue ynough for himselfe sure, and for her as much thryse. The company of women being yong, wanton foolish and light, Makes the body and head feeble, and doth cleane wast the sight. Such be yll to please, their harte and eye is vnsatiable. An old man, and a yong woman, to content is vncurable. When womens wits are mooued, of reason they take no heede: To please them agayne, muste bee by loue, dread, or else fond meede. Pryde, couetousnes and letchery, if thou wilt from them flee: From gay Apparell, treasure, and fayre women draw thy eye. Be not to bold in word and deede, for it is little honesty. In Chamber with wanton women, vse no familiarity. To them tell thou nought, that wil not beleeue thee at thy worde: It appeareth by them, their good wyll they may lyttle aforde. Of women ye haue herd part, wherby ye may perceyue my mynde: For few wordes to wyse men is best, and thus I make an ende. I hold thee wyse and well taught, I thou arte lyke to be iollye: That can beware to see the care, of another mans follye. Take the myrrour of an honest man, and marke how well he doth: Follow his steps, imbrace vertue, then doest thou well forsooth. It is better to be poore, and to lyue in rest and myrth: Then to be riche with sorrow, and come of noble byrth. If thou wilt haue health of body, euill dyet eschew: To get a good name, euill company doe not pursue. Euill ayres corrupt mans body, ill company doth the same: Use good company, thereof commeth honesty and good fame. All byrdes doe loue by kynde, that are lyke of plume and feather. Good and bad, ye wyld and tame, all kyndes doe draw togyther. Great diuersytie betweene pryde, and honesty is seene: Among the wyse it is soone iudgde, and knowne what they haue beene. By condicion and fashion, all thing sheweth as it is, Iagged or ragged, prowde or meeke, wyse men call it excesse. Many haue cunning and vertue, without due gouernaunce: Wo worth reason yll vsed, for it lacketh remembraunce. Better to speake little for profyt, then much for thy payne: It is pleasure to spend and speake, but harde to call agayne. Use thou not hastye anger, a wyse man will take leasure, The custome of sodayne mallyce, will turne to displeasure. Fyrst thinke, then speake, and then do all thinges with discretion: Giue with good will, and auoyde thy ennemye with prouisyon. Euill men take great payn to buy Hell and all for worldly pleasure: Dearer then good men buy heauen, for God is their treasure. Learn or ye be lewde, follow the proued mans aduyse, Thou shall perceyue more by his glose then by the letter is. Be thou content with fayre rebuke, and haue thy fault in mynde: The wyser that thou doest of troth, the better shalt thou fynde. If thou bee wyse consyder, thy friende both in worde and deede: And thank him that geueth thee cloth, drinke, meat and also breade. Turne not thy face lyke to a Churle, as voyde of all meekenesse: To th? that do thee good geue thanks and shew lyke gentlenesse. Many couet much, and little paynes, therefore intende to take: If case thou wilte a Mayster please, from sloth thou must awake. Of one thing take good heed, spend not thy tyme I wish in vayne: For tyme mispent and ouergone, cannot be calde agayne. Seeke thou in youth, and thou shalte fynd to be one not vntaught: Wyse or fonde foolish to rule, or to be set at nought. Take payne in youth, if case thou wilt, of men be called wyse: Or thou must take it in thy age, or be fraught full of vyce. Keepe measure euer in happye welth, a tyme to thee is lent: Better is it to saue, then so suffer when all is spent. To remember before, what wyll fall, it shall giue thy harte ease: Fortune doeth ebbe and flowe be sure, good for wit doth men please. Lyue iustlye, doe well, and haue well, let men say what they list: Be euer secrete to thy selfe, beware of had I wist. A Byrd is better in thy hande, then in Wood two or three: Leaue not certayne for vncertayne, my friend I counsell thee. Take heede betyme if thou be wyse, for tyme hath no measure: Prayse goodnesse still, blame euill men, loue is a lasting treasure. Better is truth with pouertye, then ryches are with shame: Couetousnesse quayleth gentlenesse, letchery bringeth ill name. Sufferaunce asswageth yre, and mendeth thinges amis: In little medling rest is wonne, hate stryfe if thou seeke blisse. Be not hasty in a matter, but marke thou well the ende, Be thou not Foe vnto thy selfe, though another thee offende. Presume thou not to hye I rid, least it turne thee to blame: In trust is treason, be ruled by reason, flye thou shame. No maystry is it to get a friend, but for to keepe him long: As to thyne owne selfe, so doote thy friendes eche one among. My friend where thou art put in trust, be true in word and deede: In a little falshood is great shame in truth is there much meede. Brable not thou with thy neyghbour, but let him lyue in rest: For discorde often tymes constraynes, thy friendes thee to detest. Among fooles, there is much stryfe, disdayne, grudge, and debate: With wyse men there is rest &amp; peace, after a blessed rate. Knowne there is no quyetnesse, where angry folkes doe dwell: Ten is nyne to many be sure, where men be fierce and fell. Shew gentlenesse to thy seruaunt, thats willing to amende: Wysedome willeth thee to forbeare, though he doe thee offende. In mallyce be not vengeable, as S. Mathewe doth speake, Due correction is needefull sure, for blessed are the meeke. Chyde not very often, for therein gentlenesse is none: Prooue and then chuse, of two harmes learne, alwayes to make but one. To forbeare where thou mayste ouercome, is gently still to doe; For so shalte thou cease mallyce, and make a friend of thy foe: A good man doth good, and therein doth alwayes take great payne: If his deedes be contrary found, all that he doeth is vayne. Correct not faults in other, and thy selfe do vse the fame: For so shalt thou be laught to scorne, and be reprooued with shame. Fynd thou no fault in discreete men, of good perseueraunce: But fyrst see thou correct thy selfe, of wilfull ignoraunce. Controle not so your fellowes faultes, as ye of cryme were cleare: But monish him secretlye, and keepe thy mayster from all yre. Releeue and comforte other, when thou ioyste prosperitye: And thou of other shalt haue helpe, in thy aduersytye. If thou be come of noble stocke and gentle curteous plant: Thy condicions and behauyour, will show thee I warrant. Subdue the euill mynded men, that order will not byde: Beware of common grudge and hate, at euery tyme and tyde. Ne yet conceaue thou in thy mynde, that thou canst all thinges doe: Least in trying somthing thou, canst not attayne thereto. A hye mynded man thinketh no wight worthy to match with him, But when he is to highest power, yet he is not worth a pin. Those vnderneath thy gouernaunce, doe charitably blame: And vse thou gentle speech eche hower so shalt thou get good name. A wyse man will rebuke his fault, when he is all alone: And spye it out from tyme to tyde, when he hath euill done. Moue no man that is angry, and will be so to often: A small sparke kyndles a great fyre, if it be forste to burne. To thy fellow be not coyish, nor haue of him disdayne: If vnkyndnesse doe happen, quickly be friendes agayne. To forbeare in anger is, the poynt of a friendly leeche, When the rage is past, men repent, their euill corrupt speeche. A wonderfull thing this is to doe, and easy to be done: To leaue pleasure, and keepe sylence, and to follow reason. For farre more better is it, to rule, then to be ruled: Disdayne not therefore gouernaunce, least your name be defyled. Loue thou vertue, and hate all vyce, see that thou no tyme waste: Spend in measure as thou doest get, make spare of that thou haste. Babble not ouer much my friende, if thou wylt be called wyse: To speake or prate, or vse much talke, ingenders many lyes. A foole will be alwayes teaching, but will no tyme be taught: Contrary him in his sayinges, he setteth thee at nought. All men be knowen by the workes, they vse to go about: A stedfast mans words ye neuer neede for to suspect, nor doubt. If ye haue sturdy Sampsons strength and want reason withall. It helpeth you nothing, this is playne, selfe will makes you to fall. Many haue knowledge, and yet lacke, that should belong thereto: And some are in authoritye, that very little good doe. All pollicie no one man hath, though he be of hygh science: One hath great learning, another hath got in tyme experience. Cunning with pryde in an officer fell, is sure a heauy case: The pore man prowd, the riche a theefe both of these doe lack grace. There is a tyme for all things founde, to be merry and glad: He that hath cunning without grace, of troth is but ill clad. Put not yong men in authority that are to prowde and lyght: A man tryed well in youth, his experience is of might. Many take much pryde in their owne skill, and carpe as they were cunning: But in the ende his peeuish pryde, makes all not worth a pudding. A fooles displeasure to a wyse man, is found profytable: For his good will is vnstedfast, his lust is vnsatiable. Reply not thou agaynst a prowde, and yll mans tale to much: For he thinkes of hymselfe bee sure, no man hath wysedome such. Better is it to beate a prowde man, then for to rebuke him: For he thinkes in his owne conceyte, he is wyse and very trim. Stedfastnesse in a man, aduaunceth his good name: But to be slow in godly deedes increaseth a mans shame. If thou play, game, or sporte, with thy inferyour by byrth: Use gentle pastyme, men will then, commend you in your myrth. Ueware of subtle craft and guyle, therewith be not infect. If euill be done where thou arte, men will thee soone suspect. Boast not of bawdinesse for therein, shalt thou sure be knowne: To be found letcherous, and thy yll name will be soone blowne. A man cleanly arayed, oughte cleane and pure wordes to preache: As thou wouldest be cleane in arraye, so be cleane in thy speeche. Be not to bolde in your array, nor yet boast of your goods: More worth is honesty be sure, then gawdy veluet hoodes. To giue reuerence to thy Elders, be thou still glad and fayne: Or else they will haue, learne thou this of thee no small disdayne. Reporte no slaunder, ne yet shew, the fruites of flattery: It shewes that mallyce raygns in thee as voyde of curtesye. Meddle little, and thou shalt fynde, therein a double ease: But in redressing things amis, thou highly God shalt please. Aduise well what thou speakest friend, to whome, where, how, and whan: So shalt thou get thee perfyte loue, and proue a wittye man: Thinke or thou speake, for feare of yre, take good heede at the least: By thy speeche men will perceyue thee to be man or beast. Prease not thy selfe if thou be wyse, to haue the soueraygntye: Good deeds and wisdom shal thee get in tyme authoritye. At thyne owne conceite laugh not nor make thou any game: Auoyde thou slaunderous baudy tales for why they purchase shame. Laugh not to much I thee aduyse, therein take thou no pleasure: Much laughing friend, some men doe say. a cockscombe doth procure. To sad, it is not best, the meane is aduauntage: Myrth for pollicy sometyme, is wysedome and no rage. Or ye begin marke well the ende, and thereof take good heede: A good forethought is founde a friend, at euery tyme of neede. Be not hasty aunswere to giue, before thou it debate: Lest thou repent thee afterwardes, when it will be to late. Get ere thou spend, then shalt thou bid thy friendly friend good morrowe: But if thou spent before thou get, thou shall feele much sorrowe. A byrd in hand as some men say, is worth ten flye at large: He that may be free and will not, take vpon him no charge. Disprayse not any man in absence, nor yet be vengeable: For small faultes small correction, is moste commendable. Refraine from wrath, and correct thou with meekenesse at leysure: To vtter mallice sometyme friende, bringeth thee displeasure. Know honest men haue honest wordes early and also late: Before thy equals and thy betters, playe thou not friend check mate. At thy friendes house or else where, see that by night or day: When the reckoning is past and payde then boldly go thy way. When thou borrowest keepe thy day, though it be to thy payne: Then shalt thou the sooner borrow, of thy lender agayne. Loke thou keepe promyse and thy day, thereon haue thou thy thought: Or else of thee and thyne know well, it may be dearer bought. Some men to borrow euer loue, and neuer pay agayne: Euer needy still some be found, putting their friendes to payne. Alway to begge and borrow still, cannot long tyme indure: Such men do fayle, when they thinke themselues to be most sure. No heauynesse its to a man, that nothing hath to lose: Great greefe to them that plenty hath so sayth the common glose. If that thou spent past thy degree, thy stock thou soone shalt slake: Take heede betyme, so you may sleepe, when other men doe wake. Past thy degree, couet thou not, thy port for to mayntayne: Spend not thy goods to prodigallye, spend not thy store in vayne. Looke before thou leape I wish, more ease thou mayst take: If that thou leape or thou doe looke, wysedome will thee forsake. Good counsayle in thy words to take, shall thee content and please: Be comfortable to thy friends, and to thy selfe wish ease. Be not mooued if case thy friend, tell thee thy faultes full playne: Requyte him not with mallyce great, nor his good will disdayne. A mans wysdome is prooued playne, when he is ill sayd vnto: To suffer wrong is vertue pure, fond fooles cannot doe so. When occasyon comes, thy profyt take, tyme lasteth not for euer: Tyme flits away thy welth augments as pleaseth God the giuer. If with thy mayster thou wilt speake, his leysure learne to see: It were contrary equitye, that he should wayght for thee. Some men are euer borrowing found, wythout respect of tyme: They gape for their commoditye, the sieldome wish for thyne. Use thou gentle condicions friend, giue the pore of thy good: Part. thou therof toward their want, giue them reliefe and fod. To speake the truth be bold and mylde for that is very good. For fayned speech, and falshood vylde, becommeth vyllaines blood. Mocke thou no man of what estate, or calling that he be: For that is the custome of Churles, voyde of all curtisye. To ill thy foe doth get to thee, hatred and double blame, It is a Christyan propertye, to hyde thy brothers shame. A still man is a Castle which, will him defend from woe: A busy tongue makes of his friend, oft tymes his daynfull Foe. A Gentleman vnstable found, is deemde a chylde of folly: A shamelesse lyfe in any man, declares he is not holly. A Gentleman should mercy vse, to set forth his natiuitye: He should be meeke and curteous, and full of humanitye. Pore men must be faythfull, and obedient in lyuing: Auoyding all rebellyon, and rygorous bloodshedding. Keepe grace and godly gouernaunce, alwayes within thy mynde: If thou be wanton in youth, vyce will raygn in age by kynde. Boast thou not of thy blood ne byrth, or great soueraignty: For thy good deedes assure thy selfe, shall get thee fame and glory. To one vnknowne to thee my friende, at no tyme shew thy mynde: For some men be tickle of tongue, and play the blabs by kynde. To men not acquaynted giue, no credence nor no trust: Some sortes will customably lye, but from such flye thou must. To vtter greefe doth ease the mynde, as wyse men seeme to say: But faythfull friendes at no tyme will their friendes great greefe bewraye. If other men record thy saying, it may seeme somewhat true: Utteraunce of counsayle maketh, some states to wayle and rew. Keepe counsayle if to Prynce ne Land they bring no greefe nor payne. Cotatche ech trustlesse traytor see, thou faythfull doe remayne. Be friendly with the faythfull man, but yet flye from flatterye: In all my lyfe I could scant fynde, one wight true and trusty. Fyrst seke a friend, then proue thou him that thou wilt trust vnto: So shalt thou know in tyme of neede, what he for thee will do. If case thou haue a trusty friend, chaunge him not for a new: They that trust vnto themselues, be no friendes faythfull true. Heare thou thy enimyes tale I wishe, euen to the latter end: And refuse not the sweete rebuke, of him that is your friend. If thy friend come vnto thy house, for loue or pure amitie: Exyle sadnesse, and show to him, friendly familiaritye. If giftts thou receyue of any wyght, well ponder their degree: A kynde pore mans harty rewarde, is worth the other three. Of whomsoeuer thou receyuest, giue somewhat friend agayne: For empty fystes, men vse to say, cannot the Hawke retayne. If that a straunger syt thee neare, see thou make him good cheare: For so he may reporte thy name, be sure both farre and and neare. Retayne a straunger after his estate and degree: Another tyme may happen he, may doe as much for thee. Of secrete and close matters speake, not if thou wilt be sage: Talke discretelye, let not thy tongue, go clack in an outrage. Honest men be euer content with such as they doe fynde: Take all thinges therfore in good part, vse thou a quyet mynde. Commaund not in another house, nor practyse to contende: So shalt thou be esteemed wyse, and men will thee commende. A man that is a niggard churle no tyme is lyberall: He commeth not of gentle blood that to his coyne is thrall. Sit thou not in the highest place, where the good man is present: But gyue him place, his maners marke thou with graue aduysement. Regard honest condicions friende, where ere thy steppes be bent: Or else some men with thee wyll not, assured be content. In sport and play with man and wyfe, with yongman, mayde and chylde: Be thou still meeke and honest to, gentle and also mylde. Suspect no counsayle if it be, agaynst thee neuer moued: By foolish thoughts the wysest heads, are often tymes deceyued. If thou come to a strange mans house, knock ere that thou go in: Ne yet presume thou not to farre, though he bee of thy kin. If case ye be of message sent, know you the same throughout: Then mayst thou speake boldly be sure, and neuer stand in doubt. Delight to reade good Godly bookes, and marke the meaning well: Thereof comes vertue, knowledge, pure wysedome, and sweete counsell. Here of this matter thus my friend, I seeme to make an ende: He that doth haunt to wysdoms bowre remaynes his countreys friend. The rule of honest liuing. He that spendeth much, and getteth nought, He that oweth much, and hath nought, He that looketh in his purse, and fyndeth nought, He may be sorry, and say nought. He that may and will not, He then that would shall not, He that would and cannot, May repent and sighe not. He that sweareth, tyll no man trust him, He that lyeth, tyll no man beleue him, He that boroweth till no man will lende him, Let him go where no man knoweth him. He that hath a good Mayster, and cannot keepe him, He that hath a good seruaunt, and not content with hym, He that hath such condicions, that no man loueth hym, May well know other, but few men wyll knowe hym. Thus endeth the Booke of Nurture, or gouernaunce of Youth, with Stans Puer ad mensam. Compyled by Hugh Rhodes of the Kinges Chappell.</field>
