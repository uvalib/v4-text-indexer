      <field name="fulltext">A verie merie Historie, of the Milner of Abington Fayre Lordings if you list to heere A mery Iest your mindes to cheere, Then harken to this mery tale Was neuer meryer set to sale At Abyngton it so befell Therby a widowe late did dwell She had two sonnes that she loued well For father had they none At Cambrige are they set I wene Fiue mile is them bytwene Their spendinge was full mene, To the scole there did they go Some learning for to get you knowe By good mens helpe they were kept so Other finding none they had This life longe they ledde The mother founde them at borde and bedde And by these meanes were they fedde More than seuen yere Their mother then vpon a daie To Cambridhe she toke the waie And to hir sonnes gan she saie With a heuy chere Sonnes I will be here anone And than I wot ye will come home But corne nor bread can I get none, The countrey is so deere. Mother then they sayd anone We wyll into the countrey gone To ge?d men and make our mone If wee may any thinge get, So longe they went from towne to towne In the countrey vp and downe That they gate in short season A large met of wheate Than anone when they it had Unto their mother they it lad And she therof was full glad But longe they ne let But at their neyghbours house on the morne They borowed a horse to cary their corne To the mille them beforne For nothing wolde they let The mylner was ioly in his workes all He had a doughter fayre and small The clerke of the towne loued her aboue all Iankyn was his name The mylner was so trewe and fele Of each mannes corne wolde he steale More than his Toledish by a deale He let for no shame He was so subtyll and so slye He wolde it take before their eye And make them a proper lye And put himselfe out of blame: To the mylner they were sande In the mylle dore dyd he stande They tied their horse with a bande They had harde of his name That one clerke to that other sware Of the theefe we wyll beware Haue he neuer so mykell care Of our corne getteth he but small Though he go out of his wyt Thou shalte by the spoute syt Tyll the poke faste be knyt And the meale in all Though he be neuer so wo And I wyl vp vnto the stones go And he begyle vs bothe two Foule might him befall: The corne vp the Milner wan And than the clerke fast vp ran By the stones styll stode he than Tyll it was grounde infere The mylners house is nere Not the length of a lande In a valey can it stande Two myle from Abyngton In his herte had he care For the clerkes were so ware He myght not do as he dyd are But to his sonne gan ronne Boy loke thou let for no drede The clerkes horse home thou lede Also faste as thou may spede Or the meale be done Behinde my backhouse dore him set For they shall fayle of their men Tho the poke fast be knet I sweare by my crowne The litell boye stint nought Till the horse was home brought Thereof wiste the clerkes nought Forsothe as I you saie The clerkes their meale vp hent And out at the dore they went Alas they said we be shent By god than the milner sware Than get you him no mare For some theefe was of him ware And hath had him away The one clerke sayd to the other Go we seke hymselfe brother Thou one way and I another Finde him if we maie, But euer they drede of the meale That the milner wolde therof steale The poke they bounde, and set on a seale And their horse than sought they. The mylner laughed them to scorne And great othes hath he sworne Al he might haue none of their corne He wolde haue of their meale, His daughter to the mille can fare And his diner to him bare And also faste he tolde hir yare All euery deale: How two clerkes in the morne Brought with them a met of corne And euer they warned mee beforne That I shoulde none steale But do now doughter as I thee saie Go fet mee a shete I the pray And in faithe I will do saie To get of the meale For nothinge wolde let On a whyte shete he it set And moche floure he out bet And hole was the seale With two staues in the stoure They dange theron whyles they myght doure Till they had a pecke of floure Forsothe as I you say They gathered it vp than anone And put it in a poke full soone And bade his daughter beare it home Euen the ryght way Then the clerkes had mykell thought For their horse they sought That they him finde might nought Of all that longe day And whan the night drewe nere At the mylle they met in fere And bothe they made a simple chere For their goodly hackeny That one clerke sayd by god of might Me thinke our poke is waxen light I thinke it be not all a ryght That lyketh mee full yll My heed therto dare I lay That he hath stolen some away That other clarke sayd nay nay, The seale standeth on styll: They both did to the milner say Herberowe vs to night we thee pray And we wyll therfore well pay What so euer thou wyll For we dare not to the towne gone Tyll we bring our horse home If we do by swete saynte Iohn We mon like it yll The mylner sayd by goddes might I shall barborowe you to night And your supper shall be dight Right well if wee may There they bare their meale bitwene them two And home with the mylner dyd they go His wife welcomed them tho So dyd his doughter gay Aboute a fyre they were set And good ale was there fet And therwith they their mouthes wet And soone souped they At their supper as they made them glad That one clerke nyce countenaunce made And priuely on the maidens foote he treade And she tourned awaie Whan they had eaten and made them glad The Milner his daughter bade Soone that a bed were made Also fast as you maie, And make it by the side binke That the clarkes may therein winke And slepe till it be daie: For I will to my bedde win And if you here any din It is my man dothe come in Forsothe as I you saie, For he is in the towne at his warke Whan he dothe come in the hounde will bark This ment the milner by the clarke That helde his daughter gay By one side the clarke lay By the other side his wife and he I saie And for his doughter so gay An other bedde was dyght, In a chamber as I weene Was a wall them betweene And a cake she made so clene Thereof the clarkes had a sight: Of their owne meale it was Hir lemman befell suche a case Herken sirs howe it was That he might not come that night, For to a faire was there beside On his maisters erande for to ride Erly in the morowe tide Before any day light. This one clarke styll he lay And thought on this Damsell gay And to his brother can he sate What is mee best to do, For by god and by saint Mighell I thinke so on the damosell I had muche leuer than I can tell That I might winne hir to: His brother said this is nought Of my horse I haue more thought By Iesu that mee deere bought Howe we maie winne him to. Yet lie still brother I the praie For come there what come maie At the dore I will assaie If it will vndoe, This one clarke to the dore can fare She said Iankin be ye there Ye forsothe he did answere And in there did he go, Against a fourme he hurte his shin Or he might to the bedde win Thefore the clarke was wo. Iankin she said for Mary dere Whie do ye make such cheere Your way shoulde you better leere So oft as you come heere At that worde the clarke loughe And by the voice to her he drough Of her he had his will ynough And plaide them togyther, Whan the clarke had done his will By the damosell he lay full stil And belyue she said [illeg.] How two clarkes came thyther, Upon the monday at morne And brought with them a met of of corne On a horse them beforne And bothe they were full lither. For the one clarke stode at the spoute There as the meale shoulde come out That other went euer aboute And let vs of our pray, My father did see it might be none other He rowned vnto my brother And bade it shoulde be none other But lede their horse away. My litell brother blinned nought Ere their horse was home brought Like two fooles they haue him sought All this longe daie, As we at our supper sate That one clarke nice countenaunce made And priuelie on my foote he trade But euer I tourned awaie. Upon the poke he set the seale For my father shoulde none steale Yet we had of their meale And of their whitest floure, For nothinge wolde he let On a shete we it set And with two staues it bet As longe as we might doure. And into our backhouse their horse is brought Therof wotte the clerkes nought The clarke laught and made good cheere Whan he of that myght heare That was well done my derling deere, By God my sauiour: Both together asleepe they fell, Of the other clarke I wyll you tell And of the Milners wise howe it befell A whyle if you will abide, All waking styl he laye And in his heart he thought aye My felowe hath a merie plaie In this euen tide. The Mylners wife did rise water to make Stilly for the milner should not wake The right way againe could she not take, For the house was so wide. But a childe in a cradell laie At the beddes feete as I you saie Thereby she knew the right waye Unto hir beddes side, The clarke laie and harde ylke dele And of the cradell he wyst well And if thou rise by saint Michaell The cradell shal awaie: Againe he rose or she did sleepe The clarke thereof tooke good keepe Out of his bedde soone he can creepe As fast as euer he maie. For nothing woulde he let The cradell away he fet At his beddes side he it set, Forsothe as I you saye, The good wife came anone And tyll her husbande can she gone But cradell founde she there none, Shee did seeke full fast alwaie. All about the groped fast The cradell founde shee at the last The Milner did sleepe full fast And wist not of this warke, By the cradell that she there fande, She had went it had bene hir husbande She lyft vp the clothes with her hande And laide her downe by the clarke, Thus that one clarke laye by the wife That other by the daughter by my life Had the milner wist there had ben strife For that nights warke, That one clarke waked and he dyd say That by the Milners daughter lay I must to a faire gone or it be day, And on he did his sarke. Now I pray you my hinde L?man free A gowne cloath then buie you mee And I sweare so mote I thee, I wyll paye therefore: By Iesu he saide my sweeting I haue but three shylling That is but a lyttle thing But if I had more, Thus the clarke he made it towe The Damsell her forcer to her drawe By God ye shall haue inowe For to paie therefore. The key by the cofer did hange Forthe she drewe thirty shillinge Forsothe euery farthinge And neither lesse nor more. The thirtie shillinge she gan him take This made I sir for your sake Take it nowe with you all, Nowe haue good day mine owne swetinge For longe or any day dothe springe The cocke full merelie his note will singe And my maister will mee call Full merie chere the clarke can make With thirty shillinge and his cake The righte waie can he take Downe by the wall, Till he came at his brothers bedde Than from the cradell away he yedde And anone away he fledde On the further side of the hall: Of his siluer he toke good keepe Downe by the milner can he creepe And wakened him out of his sleepe And said wilte thou heare a good game, For I haue had a merie night With the milners daughter bright Mee liketh wel by gods might That we wende not home, For I haue thirty shillinge and a cake That the false theefe fro our corne did take With that the milner did wake By god and by saint Ihon, And also she hath mee tolde Howe he hath our horse in holde In his backhouse he hath him bolde I praie god giue him shame The milner starte vp redely Thou liest he said with great enuy And that shalte thou full dere abye Theefe what hast thou done, He sterte vp in a great teene And stoute strokes was them betweene The milner was the more keene And gate the clarke downe. His wife waked anone right Out sir she said the clerkes do fight The one will slee the other to night But if you parte them soone, The clarke wakened and had great wonder But he durste them not sunder Full well he sawe his felowe vnder By the light of the moone. The milners wife hent a staffe tite Sir she said who shall I smite Dame sayde the clarke, him in the white Hit him if thou maie, The milner befel a foule happe He had on his night cappe His wife lent him suche a rappe That stil on grounde he laie. Thus the milners heed was broken The backhouse faste was broken Beleeue mee the clarkes braste it open And in than went they, The meale on the horse they caste And awaye they hyed them faste With all their things home they paste Long or any day. Forth they went by Moone light, To Abington they came right Before it was day light Home vnto their Dame, Than was her heart full light Whan she sawe her sonne in sight She thanked God with all her might That they were comen home, All their meale and thirtie shylling They gaue their mother without leasing And sence they tolde her of that thing They let for no blame, Their mother saide if ye doo right Keepe ye well out of his sight For if he may get you by goddes might He wyll doo you shame. Of that siluer the clarkes were faine The one clarke hied with all his maine And ledde their horse home againe Uppon the same morne, The mother them a Capon slew And of the cake they eate inowe And soone to Cambridge they drew, There as they were beforne Twentie shylling with them they bare Unto the schole gan they fare The Mylner gate of them no mare, If he had it sworne. Whan they were gone these scollers bothe I tell you plaine this milner was lothe And to his bedde againe he gothe For he was full of paine, His wife before had giuen him Uengeable strypes by swete saint Sim She had almoste broken bothe lithe and lim Of the Milner I tell you plaine. And so the milner and his wife For this folishe deede they had great strife All the daies of their life That he had ben so mad, And the daughter that was yonge Did often singe a sory songe And wished for the clarke that was so longe With her gowne clothe to make her glad. And also for his mery play She longed for him full sore in fay That he should come againe that waie Though she should neuer the clothe see, The wenche she was full proper and nyce Amonge all other she bare great price For she coude tricke it point deuice But fewe like her in that countree. At the laste the milner vntrewe That had ben beaten bothe blacke and blewe His owne deede he gan to rewe And though he had ben false, For many a trewer than he Was iudged without pite Upon a dreadfull gallowe tree To be hanged by the halfe But sore sicke in his bedde All his life he ledde That he was faine to be fedde Of his wife withouten mis Thus with shorte conclusion This milner through his abusion Was brought to confusion For all his falsehed iwis And ended his life full wretchedly In paine, care, and misery Wherfore he did beare an horne For steeling of meale this onlie His wife and his doughter were laine by Of two poore scolers full merely That oft did laugh him to scorne In pacience he must take it al In chamber, in bowre, and eke in hall What so euer the folke than did him call Contented muste he be: Thus endeth this mery iest iwis And Christ that is kinge of eternall blis Bringe vs all there whan his will is, Amen for charite.

An olde butteler, become a cutteler, I wene shall proue a fole. An olde trotte, that can (God wotte,) nothinge but kis the cup. With hir phisicke, will keepe one sicke, till she haue sowsed him vp. A man of lawe, that neuer sawe, the waies to buie and sell. Weninge to arise, by marchaundyse, I praye God speede him well. A marchaunt eke, that will go seke, all the meanes he may. To fall in sute, tyll he dispute, his money cleane away. Pleading the lawe, for euery strawe, shall proue a thriftie man. With bane and strife but by my life, I can not tell you whan Whan an hatter, will go smatter, in phylosophie. Or a pedler, waxe a medlar, in theologye. All that ensewe, suche craftes newe, they driue so farre a cast. That euermore, they do therefore, beshrewe themselfe at last. This thinge was tried, and verefied, here by a sergeaunt late. That rufully was, or he coulde pas, rapped about the pate. While that he woulde, see how he could, in Gods name plaie the friar. Now if ye wyl, know how it ful, take neede and ye shall heare, It happed so, not long agoe, a thriftie man there dide. An hundred pound of nobles round, than had he laide a side. His son as he would, should haue this gold for to beginne withall. But to [illeg.]se his child wel thryues, that [illeg.] were to small. per of this day, I haue herde say, that many a man certesse, Hath with good cast, be ritche at the last, that begonne with lesse. But this yong man, so wel he can, his money to imploye, That certainly, his polecie, to see it was a ioye, For least some blast might ouercast, his shippe or by mischaunce. Men with some wyle, might him beguile, and minishe his substaunce. For to put out, al maner dout, he made a good puruaie. For euery whit, by his owne wit, and tooke another waie. First faire and wele, a pretie deale, he hyd it in a potte. But than him thought, that way was nought and there he left it not. So was he faine, from thence againe, to put it in a cuppe. And by and by, as couetouslie, he supped it faire vppe. In his owne brest he thought it best, his money to inclose, Then wyst he well, what euer fell, he coulde it neuer lose. He borrowed than, of another man, money and marchaundice: Neuer paide it, vp he laide it, in lyke maner wyse. Yet on the geare, that he would weare, he taught not what he spent: So it were nice, as for the price. coulde him not myscontent. With lustie sporte, and with resorte, of ioly company. In mirth and plaie, full many a daie, he liued merily. And men had sworne, some man is borne, to dignite and powre. And so was he, for suche degree, he gate and suche honowre, That without doubte, whan he went out, a sergeaunt well and faire. Was readie straight, on him to waight, as sone as on the maire, But he doutlesse, of his mekenes, hated suche pompe and pride. And would not go, accompanied so, but drewe himselfe aside. To saint Katherine, straight as a line, he gate him at a tide For promotion, or deuotion, there would he needes bide. There spent he fast, tyll all was past, and to him came there manie. To aske their dette, but none coulde gette, the valour of a penie. With visage stoute, he bare it out, vnto the harde hedge, A moneth or twaine till he was faine, to lay his gowne to pledge, Than was he there, in greater feare, than or that he came thither. And would as faine, depart againe, but that he wist not whither. Than after this, to a frende of his. he went and there abode. Where as he laie, so sicke alwaie, he might not come abrode. It happed than, a marchaunt man that he ought money to, Of an officer, that gan enquire, what him was best to do. And he aunswerd, be not a ferde, take an action therfore, I you behest, I shall him rest, and than care for no more. I feare quod he, it will not be, for he will not come out. The sergeaunt said, be not afraide, it shall be brought about, In many a game, like to the same, haue I bene well in vre, And for your sake, let mee be bake, but if I do this cure. Thus parte they bothe, and to him goth, a pace this officer, And for a daie, all his araie, he chaunged with a frier. So was he dight, that no man might, him for a frier denie. He dopped and donked, he spake and loked, so religiouslie. Yet in a glasse, or he would passe, he toted and he pored. His heart for pride, lept in his side, to see howe well he fryred. Then forth a pace, vnto the place, he goeth in Gods name: To doo this deede, but nowe take heede, for heere beginneth the game. He drew him nie, and then softlie, at the doore he knocked. A Damsell, that heard him wel, there came and it vnlocked. The Fryar sayd, God speede fayre mayde, heere lodgeth such a man: It is tolde mee, well sir quoth she, and if he do? what than? Quod he, maistresse, no harme doutlesse, it longeth for our order. To hurt no man, but as we can, euery wyght to forder. With him truely, faine speake would I, syr quod she, by my faye: He is so sicke, yee be not lyke, to speake with him to daye. Quoth he fayre maye, yet I you pray, thus much at my desyer: Uouchsafe to doo, as goe him too, and saye an Austen Fryar, Woulde with him speake, &amp; maters breake, for his auayle certaine. Quod shee I wyl, stand ye heere styll, tyll I come downe againe. Uppe is shee goe, and tolde him so: as shee was bode to saye. He mistrustinge, no maner thinge, said mayden go thy waie. And fetche him hither, that we to gither: may talke a downe she goth. And vp him brought, no harme she thought, but it made some folke wroth: But this officer, this fained frier, whan he was come a lofte, He dopped than, and greet this man, religiously and ofte. And he againe, right glad and faine, tooke him thereby the hande: The friere than said, ye be dismaide. with trouble I vnderstande. In deede quod he, it hath with me, bene better than it is. Sir quod the frier, bee of good chere, ye shall yet after this. For christes sake, loke that ye take, no thought into your brest, God maie tourne all, and so he shall, I trust vnto the best, But I woulde nowe, comyn with you, in counsaile if you please, Or elles not, of maters that, shall set your heart at ease. Downe went the maide, the marchaunt said nowe saye on gentill frier, Of this tidinge, that ye me bringe, I long full sore to heare. Whan there was none, but they alone, the frier with euell grace Said I rest thee, come on with mee, and out he toke his mace: Thou shalte obey, come on thy way, I haue thee in my clouche, Thou goest not hence, for all the pence, the mayre hath in his pouche. This marchaunt there, for wrath and feare, waringe well nighe wood: Saide horeson the[illeg.]e, with a verie mischefe, who hath taught thee thy good? And with his fist, vpon the list. he gaue him suche a blowe, That backewarde downe, almoste in swoune, the frier is ouerthrowe. Yet was this man, well fearder than, lest he the frier had slaine: Till with good rappes, and heuy clappes, he dawed him vp againe. The frier toke heart, and vp he starte, and well he laide aboute, And so there gothe, bytwene them bothe, many a lusty cloute. They rent and tere, eche other heer, and claue [illeg.]ogidee fast: Till with lugginge, halinge and tugginge, they fell downe bothe at last. Than on the grounde, to gether rounde, with many a heuy stroke. They roule and romble, they turne and tumble, lyke pygges do in a poke. So long aboue, they heaue and shoue, togither that at the last, The maide and the wife, to breake the strife, hied them vpwarde fast. And whan they see, the captaines lye, waltringe in the place, The friers hood, they pulled a good, a downe about his face. While he was blinde, the wenche behinde, lent him on the flore. Many a iole, about the nole, with a great battill dore. The wife came to it, and with her feete, she holpe to kepe him downe: And with her rocke, many a knocke, she gaue him on the crowne. They laide his mace, about his face, that he was wode for paine, The frier frap, gate many a swap, till he was well nighe slaine. Up they him lifte, and with euell thrifte, hedlong all the staire: Downe they him threwe, and said adewe, recommaunde vs to the mayre. The frier arose, but I suppose, amased was his hedde: He shoke his heres, and from great feres, he thought him well a fledde. Quod he nowe lost is all this cost, we be neuer the nere: Ill mot he thee, that caused mee, to make my selfe a frier. Nowe maisters all, an ende I shall, make there as I began. In any wise, I wolde auyse, and councell euery man. His owne crafte vse, all newe refuse, and vtterlye let them gone. Playe not the frier, now make good cheere, and welcome euerychone. FINIS.</field>
