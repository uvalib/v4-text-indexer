      <field name="fulltext">THE GHOST OF IACKE STRAW.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Prologue. I that did act on Smythfeildes bloodie Stage, In second Richards young and tender age: And there receiu'd from Walworths fatall hand, The stabb of Death, which life did countermand: Am made a Prulogue to the Tragedie, Of LEYDEN, a Dutch Taylors villanie. Not that I ere consorted with that slaue, My rascall rout in Hollenshed you haue: But that in name, and nature wee agree, An English Traytor I, Dutch Rebell hee. In my Consort, I had the Priest Iohn Ball; Mynter the Clarke, vnto his share did fall. Hee, to haue all things common did intend: And my Rebellion, was to such an end. Euen in a word, wee both were like apoynted, To take the Sword away from Gods Anoynted: And for examples to the worlds last day, Our Traytours names shall neuer weare away: The feare fall Path's that hee and I haue trod, Haue bin accursed in the sight of God. Heere in this Register, who ere doth looke, (Which may be rightly call'd The bloody Booke) Shall see how base and rude those Villains bee, That do attempt like LEYDEN; plot like mee. And how the Diu'll in whose name they begon, Payes them Hells wages, when their worke is don: âTreason is bloodie; blood thereon attends: âTraytors are bloodie, and haue bloodie ends. FINIS. THE ARGVMENT.The attribution of this poem is questionable. From darke Damnations vault, where Horrours dwell, Infernall Furies, forth the lake of Hell. Ariu'd on earth, and with their damned euils Fill'd the whole world full of Incarnat Deuils: For all the sinnes that Hells vast gulfe containes, In euery age, and euery kingdome raignes: Murder, and I reason, False disloyall plots, Sedition, Heresie, and roguish knots: Of trayt'rous Rebels; Some of highest place, And some of meanest sort, most rascall bace: Of which degree, behold a cursed crue, Such as Hells-mouth into the World did spue: IOHN LEYDEN, but a Taylor by his trade, Of Munster towne a King would needes be made: A Parrish Clarke, a Ioyner, and a Smyth, His Nobles were, whom hee tooke counsell with: To these adioyned thousands, Boores and Clownes, Out of the Villages, and Germane Townes: Whereof great losse of blood greeuous ensew'd, Before that Campe of Hell could be subdew'd. S. R. THE LIFE AND DEATH OF IOHN LEYDEN.The attribution of this poem is questionable. When nights blacke mantle ouer th' earth was laide, And Cinthias face all curtaine-drawne with clouds: When visions do appeare in darksome shade, And nights sweet rest, dayes care in quiet shrowds; About the hower of twelue in dead of night, A mangled Corse appeared to my sight. Skin torne, Flesh wounded, vgly to behold: A totterd Body peece-meale pull'd in sunder: Harken (quoth hee) to that which shall be told, And looke not thus amaz'd with feare and wonder: Though I am all be stabbed, slash'd, and torne, I am not CÃ¦sar, him, an's ghost I scorne. Icke bin Hans Leyden; vnderstandst thou Dutch? IOHN LEYDEN King of Munster, I am hee, That haue in Germanie bin feard as much, As any CÃ¦sar in the world could bee: From the first houre that I armes did take, I made the Germaine Gallants feare and quake. By facultie at first, I was a Taylour, But all my minde was Kingly eue'ry thought: For e'en with Cerberus, Hels dogged Iaylour, A combat hand to hand I durst haue fought: Then with my trade, what's hee that hath to doo? Old Father Adam was a Taylour too: Hee made him Fig leaue Breeches at his fall, And of that stuffe his Wife a Kirtle wore: Then let both Needle, Threed, my Sheares and all, Keepe with the trade; a Noble minde I bore: And let this Title witnes my renowne, IOHN LEYDEN Taylour, King of Munster towne. My Councellers were these, a valiant Smyth, As tall a man as euer strooke a heate, Call'd Knipperdulling; wondrous full of pith: Crafting the Ioyner, one of courage great: Tom Mynter, a madd Rogue, out Parrish Clarke, Whose doctrine wee with diligence did marke. Hee taught on topp of Mole-hill, Bush, and Tree, The Traytors text in England; Parson Ball Affirming wee ought Kings apeece to bee, And euery thing be common vnto all: For when old Adam delu'd, and Euah span, Where was my silken veluet Gentleman? Wee Adams Sonnes; Hee Monarch of the Earth, How can wee chuse but be of Royall blood? Beeing all descended from so high a birth? Why should not wee share wealth, and worldly good? Tush Maisters (quoth Tom Mynter) reason binds it, Hee that lacks Mony, take it where he finds it. Why, is not euery thing Gods guift, we haue? Doe Beastes and Cattell buy the Grasse they eate? Shall that be sould, which Nature freely gaue? Why should a Man pay Mony for his Meate, Or buy his Drinke, that parboyld Beere and Ale, The Fyshes broth, which Brewers do retayle? Pray who is Landlord to the Lyons den? Or who payes House-rent for the Foxes hole? Shall Beastes enioy more priuiledge then Men! May they feed dayly vpon that is stole, Eating and drinking freely Natur's store, Yet pay for nought they take, nor goe on score? Do not the Fowles share fellow like together, And freely take their foode eu'en where they please, A whole yeeres dyet costes them not a Fether? And likewise all the Fyshes in the Seas, Do they not franckly feed on that they get, And for their victu'als are in no mans debt? And shall Man, being Lord of all the rest, (Vnto whose seruice these were all ordayned) Of meate, nor drinke, nor clothing, be possest, Vnlesse the same by Mony be obtayned? Pay House-rent, buy his foode, and all his clothing, When other Creatures haue good cheare for nothing? Wee'le none of that (quoth I, to my consorts.) No (quoth Tom Mynter) frends, it ought not bee: Come Libertie, and Wealth, and Princely sports: Why, Kings are made of Clay; and so are wee: Wee'le ayme our thoughts on high, at Honors marke: All rowly, powly; Tayler, Smyth, and Clarke. Wee are the men will make our Valours knowne, To teach this doting world new reformation: New Lawes, and new Religion of our owne, To bring our selues in wondrous admiration: Let's turne the world cleane vpside downe, (mad slaues) So to be talk'd of, when w'are in our Graues. Braue Knipperdulling, set thy Forge on fire. It shall be done this present night (quoth hee,) Tom Mynter, leaue Amen vnto the Quier. Quoth Tom, I scorne hencefoorth a Clarke to bee, Cornellis, hang thy woodden Ioyners trade, For Noble-men apeece you shall be made. And fellow mates; Nobles and Gallants all, To Maiestie you must your mindes dispose: My Lord Hans Hogg, forsake your Butchers stall. Hendrick the Botcher, cease from heeling Hose. Classe Chaundler, let your Weick and Tallow lye, And Peeter Cobler, cast your old Shooes by. For you my valiant Lords, are men of witt, And farre too good for base and seruile trades, Your Martiall power may be compared fitt, Vnto the strength of our strong Germane Iades: Who it they had but knowledge to their force, What whistling Car-man could commaund his Horse? Your guifts are rare, and singular to finde, Beeing full of courage, resolute, and wise: Yet to behold these parts you haue bin blinde. Or could you see your Valour with mine eyes, You would exclame that Ignoraunce so long, Hath done so worthy Men, such open wrong. But now my Lyon-harted Caualiers, Let vs march after war-like Mars his Drome, Your Prentiships are out of subiect yeeres; Now let vs show the Houses whence wee come: For wondrous matters there are to be done, Crownes must be conquerd, Kingdoms must be wonne. Tom Mynter, goe and preach vnto the Boores All Libertie, all Freedome, Ease, and Wealth: And if they will, alow them Queanes and Whores: Bid them Drinke free, and pledge Good-fellows health: Say Goods are common, each man to suffize, The Rich-mans purse, is Poore-mans lawfull prize. Tell them, they need not stand on honest dealing, To borrow Mony, and to pay againe: And those that haue occasion to be stealing, May take a Purse, if need do so constraine: Poore Men must haue it: Gentlemen must liue: Good-fellowes cannot stay till Misers giue. There's none of vs (my Maisters) but may want, Our Purses may haue emptie stomackes all, But he shall finde his dyet to be scant, Whose credit's scord vpon an Ale-house wall, I owe a debt my selfe onely for Beere, Amounts to more then I haue earnd this yeere. And let me come to a base Tapsters house, Where I but owe some twentie doosen of Beere, The rascall will not giue me one carowse, But tels me straight how eu'ery thing is deere: Tis a hard world, the Brewer must be pay'd: Thus on my emptie Purse the Villaine play'd. This is his state, whose Purse is lyned thin, And goes on trust, beholding for his shot, With, By your leaue, hee must come creeping in: I pray you Brother, let vs haue a Pot, How does all heere? pray is mine Hostes well? Cursse not your debtors: How doest honest Nell. This shaking humor, I do much detest, Which emptie Purses do inflict on some: I can not be beholden, I protest, Mony must make mee welcome where I come: If Siluer in my Pockets do not ring, All's out of tune with mee in eu'ry thing. What extreame griefe doth Monyes want procure? How madd and franticke doth it make the minde? Againe, how chearefully can Mony cure? When Phisicke comes in Gold, and Siluer's kinde, To thinke on this, what's hee, that would not craue it, And fight himselfe out of his skin to haue it? Thus my braue Caualiers, you plainely see, Vpon what golden ground wee set our foote, Courage Dutch bloods, I say couragious bee, Wee will haue Wealth, and Libertie to boote: Let vs goe forward as we haue begone. And wee'le make bloody sport belove ti's done. IOHN LEYDEN, TOM MINTER, KNIPPERDVLLING, and their consortes; the first inuentors of the Dreames and Dotages of the heriticall Anabaptists in Germanie. There neuer was so odious a pretence, Nor any Act so wicked and so vile, But some would take vpon them a defence To colour it; the easier to beguile The simple sort, which haue vnstayed mindes, Whose hastie Iudgment Errour easly blindes. So these leawd wretches, sprung from Villain race, That had all Pietie in detestation: A Rascall sort, that were eu'en spent of Grace, Would take on them Religions reformation: And in the fore-front of their villanie, Tom Mynter vtters new fond Herezie. Deare Friends (quoth he) that wee may haue successe, In this our honorable enterprise: Which you shall see the very heau'ens will blesse, It from a Christian zeale it do arise, Let's mende the Church in matters are amisse, Especially in one thing; which is this, Christ gaue commission to the twelue, saying: Goe Into all Nations; Preach, and there Baptize. So that you see the very wordes doe showe, And from the substaunce of them doth arise, Wee first must be of yeeres to vnderstand, Before wee take that Sacrament in hand. Therefore wee'le haue no Babes to be Baptized, Vntill thy come to yeeres of tipe discretion, That of the Fayth they may be first aduised, And yeeld the world accompt of their profession: For you may see, vnlesse your sight be blinde, Beliefe is first, and Baptisme comes behinde. And yet (my Maistars) you may dayly see, In any Country where so ere you come, Such store of little Children christned bee: T'is infinite for one to count the summe: But let vs take another course, I pray; Those forward Sucklings shall hereafter slay. What say you to it? are you all agree'd, That this same doctrine shall be our chiefe ground: It shall (sayd Leyden) and I haue decreed, That it be helde for holsome, good, and sound: And for example I haue thought it best, To be new Christned heere, before the rest. Let's haue a Bason, and some Water straight, With all the present speed it may be brought: For I perceiue this matter is of waight, My Christ'ning when I was a Child, is nought: Surely I thinke I am no Christian yet, A Booke good honest Mynter quickly get. Well say I, ar't readie? Shall wee need God-father? Yes: take you Harman Cromme, or any other: I haue a minde to Knipperdulling rather: And Tannekin may serue to be God-mother, Or Knipperdulling ioyn'd with Harmon Cromme: Let it be so: some water; quickly come. Thus on they goe, with errours foule defil'd, In rude prophaning Holy ordinaunce: And Mynter asketh, Who doth name the Child? Call him (quoth Knipperdulling) Yoncker Hans, His noble minde, and nature do agree, And therefore hee a Yoncker Hans shall bee. Now (quoth Tom Mynter) let mee make a motion, To which I do beseech you all incline: Let euery man that's heere, with one deuotion, Come follow mee to drinke some Reddish wine; Our inward loue, let outward deedes reueale it, And to the Tauerne let vs goe and seale it. The Rebels dayly increasing in great multitudes of the rude Boores, and illiterate Clownes, propounded vnto themselues diuers monstrous absurdities, confirmed by their Captaines Yoncker, Hans, and Knipperdulling: which by them are Intituled Twelue Articles of Christian Libertie. What is it from the Cocatrice doth passe, But such a natur'd Serpent as him selfe? What sees an Ape within a Looking glasse, But a deformed, and ill fauour'd elfe? What Good fruite commeth from an euill tree? Or how should Villains ought but Villains bee? Like desper'at mad-men voyde of Reasons vse, They run to any outrage can be thought: And Libertie is made the Rebels scuse, Which now by Dreames and Fancies so hath wrought, That Yoncker Hans vnto his rable rout, Twelue Articles of Libertie giues out. And first sets downe: They need not stand in feare Of Magistrate or Ruler, for offence: But they themselues might causes freely heare, And so end matters; sauing much expence Of Coyne in Fees, which vnto Lawyers fall: For wee'le (quoth Yonker Hans) be Lawyers all. If that a wrong to any man be done, Let him repaire to mee, and my two Lords, Wee'le end the strife so soone as ti's begone: For halfe a doozen of Beere, in quiet words, And make them drinke together, and be friends, Shake hands, and like good fellowes make amends Next, if a man's disposed for to ride, And hath no Horse, nor doth intend to hire, Hee may take one vpon the high-way side, To serue, as his occasion doth require, All-wayes prouided, when his Iournye's don, Hee is to turne him loose, and let him run. Also, if any Woman chaunce to marrie, And that her Husband prooue not to her minde, Shee shall be at her choyce with him to tarrie, Or take an other whom she knowes more kinde: Wee thinke it meete no Woman should be bound, To him in whom no kindnes can be found. For if shee match for Wit, and hee turne Clowne, Or any way her bargaine prooueth ill, Shee may stay with him till her wedding Gowne Be worne, and then be at her owne free-will, To take another, and exchange the Lout: This Law of out's, shall serue to beare her out. Yea, further (which should haue bin sayd before) That man which hath not Wife enough of one, Why, let him (if he please) take halfe a score: Wee'le be his warrant, or to builde vpon: Wee in our wisedomes do alow it so, For good sound reasons that wee haue to show. For say, you meete with such, as most men do, Of this same proud, and iole huswi'e brood, Shrewish, and toyish; foolish, queanish to: Full of bad faults, and nere an inch that's good: What should men do with such vngracious wiues? Turne them to grasse, and so liue quiet liues. Besides, Tenants shall need to pay no rent, The Earth's the Lords, and all that is therein: Land-lords may hang them-selues with one consent; And if they please, next Quarter day begin: Wee will not be indebted vnto any, But be Free-holders, paying not a penny. All Bonds and Bils, shall be of no effect: And hee that will not pay his Debt, may chuse: This Hand, and Seale, no man shall need respect: Day of the month; and toyes that Scriueners vse: Sheepe-skins, and Waxe, shall now no more preuayle, To bring a man into the dolefull Iayle. All Prisons shall be presently pul'd downe, For wee will haue good Fellowes walke at large: A paire of Stocks shall not appeare in Towne: This in our names, wee very straightly charge: What reason is it when the hands haue stole, To put the Legs into a wodden hole? No man shall need obay any Arest, Let th' action be what t'will, trespasse or debt: All Surety-ship, shall be an idle iest: No Creditor thereby shall vantage get: All Beasts and Cattell, Oxen, Sheepe, and Kine, Shall be his that will haue them: yours, and mine. All Forrests, Parks, and Chases, shall be free For each man that delighteth in the game: Orchards and Gardens likewise common bee: All Fruites and Hearbs, let him that will come clayme: And euery thing that any man shall need, According to his will, let him proceed. Who will not draw his weapon in this cause, And fight it out, as long as he can stand? Which of you all will disalow these Lawes, And will deny our Articles his hand? Then all cry'd out, This Doctrine wee'le defende, And liues a peece about it wee will spende. Our Will's our Law; our Swordes the same shall pen, What wee decree, let's see who dare resist? Wee care not for the Lawes of other men, But will without controule do what wee list: Wee are growne strong; and wee are very wise, My honest Gentlemen, let this suffize. With courage now let vs our selues addresse, Attempting on the sodaine Munster I owne: Let euery one be in a readines, Kind Fortune smyles: regard not who doth frowne: At euery Church wee'le hang a Tauerne signe, And wash our Horses feete in Rennish-wine. The Rebels in a furious resolution, enter the Towne of Munster: where with insolent proude audations Spirits, they inflict most iniurious wronges vpon the inhabitants, taking greatest glorie in acting villanie. With desp'rat Resolution, mad-braine heat, Munster they enter like to sauage Beares: The Cittizens no fauour could entreat, For all their goods are common, Leyden sweares Catch that catch may; hee bids his Souldiers share, Deuide the spoyle, and take no further care. Freely supply your wants, who euer lackes: Chearely my harts; care. drinke, and domineere, Ryfell the rich and wealthy Marchants packes: Make all things cheape that heeretofore were deere: And where you finde an Vsurer, be bold To cut his throat, and take away his gold. Adorne your selues in princely braue attire, Put downe with State the Emperours of Roome: And giue the foolish world cause to admire, And say, wee passe, each base and common Groome: Though some of you (say Lords) came from the Plow, Wee'le make them stoope, that haue disdaind to bow. Haue you not heard that Scythian Tamberlaine VVas earst a Sheepheard ere he play'd the King? First ouer Cattell hee began his raigne, Then Countries in subiection hee did bring: And Fortunes fauours so mayntain'd his side, Kings were his Coach-horse, when he pleas'd to ride. Do you not see our valorous successe, How easily wee haue attayn'd this Towne? VVhat thinke you then in time wee shall possesse, VVhen Greatnes comes to backe vs with renowne? VVhy sure I thinke our shares will so increase, That wee shall let our Kingdomes by the lease. Fill Bowles of VVine, and let vs drinke a health: Carowse in Glasses that are fiue foote deepe: You worthy members of the Common-wealth, Munster is ours, and Munster wee will keepe: Boone-fier the streetes; set Bells a worke to ring For ioy a Taylour is become a King. Bring foorth all Pris'ners presently to mee, And let the Magistrates supply their place; Prisons for true-men now shall only bee: Braue Theeues, with many fauours wee will grace, Such men as they, wich courage do proceed, And of their seruice wee shall stand in need. For Theeues (you know) of feare make no account, They'le hazard hanging, for a little gaine: And though vnto the Gallowes top they mount, Both Halter and the Hang-man they disdaine, How many die at Tyburne in a yeere? VVould make vs gallant Souldiers, were they heere. Ile tell yee Maisters, I haue knowne men die, That haue out-brau'd the Hang-man to his face: Such as would giue an Emperour the lie, And valiant take a Purse in any place, Bid a man stand vpon the hige-way side, When he hath had exceeding haste to ride. As full of courage as their skins could hold, Spending as franckly as they freely got: Scowring the rust from Siluer and from Gold, That Misers hoorded vp and vsed not: As honest men as wee, in all their dealing, And yet are hang'd for nothing but for stealing. Example to you of a friend Ile make, And I beseech you all, to note the thing: Who being to be married, went and spake Vnto a Goldsmith for a wedding Ring, And comming for it when he should be wed, The dores were shut, and e'ry one abed: Hee had no reason stand and knocke all day, But brake the windowes open, in a iest, Taking all Rings he found, with him away, To chuse his owne the better, from the rest: Meaning to put the Gold-smith but in feare, In making him suppose some Theefe were there. Well, this poore fellow hee was apprehended. Brought to the Barr, and as a Fellon try'd, And yet you see hee iestingly offended, Hauing good reason for it on his syde: But all his protestations were in vaine, For he was hang'd in earnest for his paine. Another honest fellow as hee went, Did draw a Halter after him along, Thinking no hurt, nor hauing an intent To offer any kind of creature wrong: One comes behind him was the Hang-mans frend, And tyde a Horse vnto the Halters end. The owner met him leading of his beast, And charged him with felony (poore man) Although in this same matter he knew least, There is no remedie, say what he can To prison, hang him for an arrant thiefe. How say my maisters is not this a griefe? But wee'le take order for such matters now, For theeues and Gentlemen shall be all one, To take a purse, or horse, we will allow, And let him boldly do it that hath none: Take any thing that any man shall lacke, To fill the belly and to cloth the backe. If any finde himselfe herewith agreeued, Let him be whipt and banisht forth the towne, With rich mens goods we meane to haue releeued The very poorest meane and basest clowne, Weele haue it so my Lords, it shall be thus, Lets see who dare but stand on tearmes with vs. Tom Mynter, prethe search the towne with speed, Chuse out the fayrest of the female kinde, Some lustie wenches of the Germane breede, For to the flesh I feele my selfe inclinde: Some halfe a dosen wiues for me prouide, And stocke me with some Concubines beside. Go to the Goldsmithes in my princely name, Will and commaund them presently forthwith They send such chaynes and Iewels as I clayme By Knipperdullings mouth, my Lord the Smith, Without demaunding any thing therefore, I neither meane to pay, not go on score. Let others to the Mercers shops repayre, And tell them we do silke and veluet lacke, Our seame-rent Souldiers are exceeding bare, Scant any tatters hanging on their backe. Rich Taffata and Veluet of three pile, Must serue our vse to swagger in a while. Commaund the Marchants to supply our Court With all abundance of the choycest Wine: Vnto the Butchers likewise make resort, Bid them prouid vs Oxen, Sheepe, and Swine: Charge Brewers to present vs with their trade, And that their Beere be somewhat stronger made. The Baker in his office to appeere, His Mealy-worship wee do greatly want: And store of Cookes let vs haue likewise heere, To dresse our dishes, that they be not scant: All things in plentie, and abundant store, Bee merry, eate, and drinke, and call for more. This for a Resolution wee set downe, And do ordaine that it continue still: All is our owne that is within the Towne, And wee are men that haue the world at will: Fill Bowles of Wine, carowse a High-Dutch round, For Cares lye conquerd, and our Ioyes are croun'd. Munster being beseiged by the Duke of Saxonie, the Rebels indure great myserie, and extremitie by famishment; but constrained in the end to yeelde: their principall Captaines Leyden, Knipperdulling, and Mynter, are tortur'd and put to death, for example to all of Rebellious damned disposition, ending as desperate, as their liues were diuelish. Ambitions wheele, which Traytors do aspire, Hath brought the Rebels to their altitude: And now declining, downe-ward they retire, By iust Reuenge a downe-fall to conclude, From top of Treason, thus they turne about: For now behold, their cursed date run out. The Martiall Duke layd seige vnto them now, Preuenting them of needfull wants supply, With Hungers sharpest sword, to make them bow: No expectation but resolue to dye, Their length of life was measur'd by their store, Which could not be enlarg'd a crum the more. Yet most extreame hard cruell shift they made, Holding the towne besieg'd aboue a yeere, In which sharpe time their paunches were betraide Of all their former feastes and belly cheere, For each mans stomack deem'd his throat was cut, There was such emptinesse in ery gut. When wholesome foode was all consumde and gone, After a hard allowance they had past, Horses and Dogges they lickt their lips vpon, Then Rats and Mise grew daintie meate at last, Olde shooes they boyld, which made good broth beside, Buffe-lether Ierkins cut in Steakes they fride. Not an olde payre of Bootes did walke the streete, Their bellies could not spare their legs the lether, But stew'd they were, and hunger made them sweete, For with that sauce they shar'd alike together. Couers of Bookes were in like maner drest, And happie he was such a dishes ghest. The Chaundlers crawling tallow vtt'red well, It seru'd Hans Leyden and his Lords owne table, There was no fault found with the taste nor smell, Their onely griefe was this, they were not able To maintaine that good cheere, which grew so scant, Of filthie kitchin stuffe they found great want. When they had eaten vp the Chaundlers trade, As likewise all the ware Shoomakers had, The Scriueners shops for parchment they inuade, And seize vpon it euen hunger mad, Cancelling with their teeth both bond and bill, Looke after debts and pay them he that will. In these extreames (quoth Leyden to the rest) What shall we doe in this accursed case? Aduise me now Tom Mynter what were best, What's to be done in this same hungry place? Speake Knipperdulling lets haue thy aduice, There's no prouision left of Rats and Mice. Why, fire the Towne, as late I did my Forge, (Quoth Knipperdulling) I do thinke it meete, Least Saxon imitate English Saint George, And trample vs like Dragons vnder feete: Like Troy, let flame and smoake ascend the skyes, Wee burne like Phenix, that in fier dyes. Or let vs on a sodaine issue out, And rush vpon those rascals keepe vs in: Most desperat in that wee go about, As not respecting if wee lose or win: Be as it wil, wee haue but liues to spend, A puffe of breath, and therewithall an end. In this estate despayring of their liues, Iohn Leyden plots in his fantastique hed, To send out of the Towne one of his Wiues Vnto the Duke, to tell him shee is fled From those accursed Rebels, to his grace, To signifie the Citties weakest place. Thou must (quoth hee) play Iudiths part for all, And free vs from this same Assirian host: Bring Holefernes head vnto the wall, That thus against Bethulia doth bost: I had a Vision did appeare to mee, Which signified thou should'st our Iudith bee. And by thy meanes deliueraunce procure, Sauing out loues, to thy immortall prayse: Then holy woman put this worke in vre, Thou seest we die, if wee indure delayes: Thou hast rare beautie, on with rich attire, And good successe incline to thy desire. This silly Woman easily deluded, Prepares her selfe vnto the enterprise: Departs the Towne as Leyden had concluded, Vnto the Duke, attyred in disguise, As if shee had by secret made escape, Taking on her an Hipocrites true shape. Deliuers all the cunning she was taught, To gaine her credit, and to free suspect. The Duke misdoubts her practize to be nought, And by examination findes direct The plot, and all the drift why shee was sent, And thus to worke with this false Iudith went. A Scaffold was erected in the fight Of all the Rebels, that they might perceiue Their Gentlewoman playd not Iudith right: Because her head behind her she did leaue: âFor Treason neuer is so well contriu'd, âBut still the plotter is the shortest liu'd. Then did the Duke assault them very strong, Who being weake, vnable to resist, Tir'd out with famine they endured long, And did subdue them euen as he list: Such leaue Anotamies they seemed all, Like those dry bones in the Chirurgeons hall. And heere ends LEYDENS kingdome and his raigne, His counterfayted tytle's out of date, Hee is Iohn Leyden Taylor now againe: And those that were his Noble-men of late, Are eu'en restored to their first degree, Smyth, Clarke, and Ioyner, arrant Knaues all three. To their deserued deaths they are appoynted, For all their villanies, and extreame wrongs: Drawne through the Cittie streets, and then disioynted, Their flesh torne from the bones with fiery tongs: And as their liues did to all mischeife tend, So did the desp'rat vnrepentant end. Being dead there were three Iron Cages made For strength and substaunce to endure and last, And into them their bodyes were conueyd, And on the Citties highest Steeple plast, Leyden hung highest, to expresse his pride, Mynter, and Knipperdulling on each side. The like reward, be like offenders due. Let Traytors ends be violent, and euill: And as these past, so all that shall ensue, Let them receiue their wages from the Deuill: Hee sets a worke, and stirres them to a pire, And is to pay them vengeaunce for their hire.
