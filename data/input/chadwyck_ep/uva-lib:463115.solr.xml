      <field name="fulltext">Come ye Children (in vnderstanding) I will teach you the feare of the Lord. Psal. 34. 11.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let the words of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisedome, teaching and admonishing your owne selues, in Psalmes, Hymnes and spirituall Songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord. Col. 3. 16.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A song in stead of an Introduction to this worke, worthy your reading and entituled A Table of good Counsell. It will goe to the tune of in Create, if you sing it. First learne to honour God-aright, Let loue and feare thereto provok: Obey the King, with all thy might Submit thy selfe to Parents yoke. Imbrace the good and shunne the ill: This is the summe of wisedomes skill. To know thy selfe thou must apply: And try thy friend before thou trust: Content thy selfe, clime not too hie, Let word and deed be all waies iust. Striue not to swim against the streame: Account not of a drowsie dreame. Wish not for wealth by parents death, A friend farre passeth worldly good: And while the body yeeldeth breath, Seeke not for to exceede in foode. For great excesse of meate and drinke, Doth cause the soule in sinne to sinke. Faint not though fortune fauour fooles, Fret not at others good successe: Delight to sit in learned schooles, Thy former faults seeke to redresse. Spurne not at him that tells thy crime, Mend that against another time. Spend sparingly yet not too nye, And make accompt how wealth doth wast: Hate Suretiship all debt bookes flie. To giue thy word make thou no hast. Let not apparrell sumptuous be: But still remember thy degree. Respect not only present time, But marke also what may ensue: For cracke of credit is a crime, Change not an old friend for a new. Take heed of brasen face past shame: And loue to liue in honest fame. Praise no man till thou dost him knowe, Dispraise not rashly any wight: Least shame thereby to thee may growe, Speake but few words place them aright. Into the world then maist thou goe, And say thy friend hath taught thee so. The summe of the Creed in Meeter. In Father Sonne and Holy Ghost, Beleeue I stedfastly, And that Christ Iesus Man became: I hold as earnestlie. He also suffered for our sinnes, Himselfe still voyde of sinne: Who did descend the manner how, I say not much therein. We find that Christ felt so much paine, As satisfied Gods Ire: And reconciled man to God, Thats all we neede require. And as for Christ in Pix, in bread, Or harrowing vp of Hell: Of Purgatory Limbus twaine, The Scripture doth not tell. One true Church Catholike there is, One earth still Millitant: And I a member of the same, Through Christ now Tryumphant. This Church it hath Communion, And God remitts their sinne: To life and glory they shall rise, And they shall neuer linne, To sing out Hallelviah, In euerlasting Blisse, Wherefore beleeue and liue well here, That so you may be his. Amen. The summe of the Tenne Commandements. 1 None but Iehova haue for God, 2 No Creature worship thou, 3 Take not Gods holy Name in vaine, 4 Keepe well the Sabboth now, 5 Thy Parents honor and obey, 6 No murder once commit, 7 Be none adulterer at all, 8 Steale not by hand or wit, 9 False witnesse beare thou not, I say, 10 Ne couet not in heart, Thy neighbors wife, seruant or goods, That God gaue for his part. These Ten Commandements we deuide, Still into Tables twaine: And take them for our spirituall guide, And our direction plaine. First to the worship of our God, And then to Christian loue: That we may shunne the fiery rod, And liue in heauen aboue. Then doe not like to Papists adde, Nor take from this his Law, But downe with Images and all, And euer liue in Awe. And as the Lord did make vs all, So let him teach vs too; For he knowes what is best for vs, And we blind what to doe. FINIS. A Briefe of the Lords Prayer. O Father ours which art in heauen, Still hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdome come, thy will be done, In earth without all blame. As it performed is in heauen, Of soules and Angels bright: Where thou art serued without sin, And praysed day and night. Giue vs this day our daily bread, Forgiue our sinnes likewise, As we forgiue them that vs hurt, When quarrells doe arise. Into temptation lead us not, So to be overcome, As wicked persons euer are, That lose thy sweet kingdome. For thine is that celestiall place, With power and glorie still, Both now and euermore, Amen, Say we with right good will. To pray to Saints or creatures then, you see tis Po-pe-rie, To haue a Picture in this worke: Is idle certainely. A Crucifix is nothing worth, Ne Beades to count vpon: For blind-men they must leaue those Paints, And pray to God alone. FINIS. The Summe of the old Covenant or Testament with the two Sacraments thereof giuen to the Iewes by Almightie God. Iehova that great God of heaven, gaue to the fathers old: A covenant of doing all, That in the Law is told. Doe this and liue said God to them, But no man could do so: Wherefore the law sends all to Christ, To keepe their soules from woe. This covenant was sign'd and seald, With two cleere Sacraments: The first was Circumcision, Withall rights and intents. Th' other was the Passeouer, Wherein Christ was set out: The Lambe of God slaine for our sinnes, Of this be out of doubt. FINIS. The Summe of the new Couenant or Testament with the two Sacraments confirming the same and given both to the Iewes and Gentills by Iesus Christ the sonne of God. The Couenant of Christ with man, in the new Testament: Is this that we beleeue in him, and striue with whole intent. To loue and liue as Christ hath done, yea beare his crosse and pray: That we may doe as we would haue, men deale with vs alway, This Covenant also is confirmed With holy Sacraments twaine, Which likewise set out Christ to vs, Who for our sinnes was slaine. The first of these is Baptisme, Which sets out our new Birth. The other the Lords Supper is Which brings vs heavenly mirth, And thus one Church is gathered Of Jewes and Gentiles eke, Rome therefore is a Harlot sound And our Church Catholicke: For we stand firmly to Gods word, And thereby wilbe taught, But Papists cheifely by the Pope, Which thing great strife hath wrought; These Sacraments which Christ set out They like not simple-ly But will have J. S. to Christs twaine; And giue no reason why. Consider what absurdities, Doe grow of this by them. Five covenants more they would confirme, Belike from mortall men. Their Priests of all men should receiue The Sacraments each one. Yet must he not be married, For then his Priest-hoods gone; Some of these fiue cal'd Sacraments, The people may not haue: As Orders yea and Marriage too, Which some men will not craue. Where as the Sacraments of Christ, Must be received of all: Even as his Law and Covenant, Which serues for great and small. But I will now contend no more, I seeke to teach the Truth: And to bewraye Absurdities, To aged folke and youth. FINIS. An instruction of the whole year: deuided in 12. Months, foure seasons or quarters as also into weekes and daies, of the Sabboth or Lords day: and what is the true keeping of it. Of a Yeare. A yeare is that which holds from spring to spring From march to march the fiue &amp; twentith day Wherein we sow and reape of euery thing, To serue for meat and clothing as we say. Of the 12. Monthes in the yeare. Twelue monthes there are belonging to each year Into foure quarters we divide the same. Thirteen full moons in this space doe appeare And 4 weeks maks vp euery month we name Of the names of the Monthes. Cold Ianuary, Februarie, March, Mild Aprill, May, with Iune and Iuly these, Hot August which the corn doth ripe &amp; parch September sweet which doth the Ploughman please October and November then takes place, The last of all these Months is cald December And they that haue but even a sparke of grace Gods benefits in these they will remember. Of the 4. Quarters in the yeare 1 The Quarters foure in all the year are these March twentie fiue is cald our Lady-day, Or the Anun-tia-ti-on if you please, Of blessed Marie by that man of ioy. I meane the Angell Gabriell which did come, With newes fr? heau? that she shuld mother be Of Iesus Christ Gods deare &amp; only sonne, Which story in the Scripture all may see. 2 The second quarter hapneth still in Iune, And Saint Iohn Baptists day we doe it call: Or Midsommer in English speach or tune, The yeare is then at best as it will fall. 3 The third is in the Month we call Sept?ber And beares the name of glorious Mi-cha-ell Wherein let poore men euer more remember Their yeare or halfe yeares rent to pay downe well 4 The fourth and last falls in December still, And Christmas quarter men doe cal the same God grant vs in them all to doe Gods will. And so to thriue in body, goods, and name. FINIS. A religious Letter, shewing how and whom to wooe in the way of Marriage, though all men cannot doe, or haue it so as is here set downe. In humble wise I doe commend, and write these words to you: Whom I esteeme as my deare friend, neuer to change for new. Vnto my words in patience, now let your eares incline: And that will be some recompence, to quit these paynes of mine. In younger yeares when strength did grow, and nature sought her will: I vsed all good meanes that are, The same to quench and kill. I prayd to God, I fasted oft, I kept from com-pa-ny: I read good bookes to beat downe lust, And harlots haunts did fly. I labor'd in my calling much, I watcht and studied harde: Yet as I sat the tempter came, With all his band and guard. Evill motions he did raise in me, With O na-nizme Sinne: But I likte not or gaue consent, To ought that he brought in. But I would walke abroad sometimes, And take some re-cre-ation: To put vaine thoughts out of my heart, In good and christian fashion. And even in this had I respect, to every cir-cum-stance, Time, place and seasons every thing, That goodnes might advance. Then went I to my worke againe, I never made a toyle: Of sport or recreation, Which should be but as File To get the Mellancholly ruste And filth of flesh away? Least Sinne and Sathan should in me As Kings beare rule and sway. When none of these things did prevaile But Sathan tempted still: I thought vpon mans last refuge; Gods lawes for to fulfill. I meane the honest Marriage Bed, Therein to liue most chast: My body which Gods Temple Is, No way to file or wast. My Parents which did bring me vp, Gaue learning to mine Art: And made me often read Gods word, Which I laid vp in heart. Thus getting Scripture readily, As at my fingers ends: I vanquisht world the flesh and Divell, Not shaming selfe nor friends. This was of God, I wrought it not, but here all sorts may see: Christs yoke is easyer then we judge, If good meanes vsed be. But if like Cowardes we will yeelde, To lust and to affection: So oft as Sathan he will tempt, In vaine is all direction. Wherefore such counsell as I reade, Such counsell giue will I: Resist the Deuill faith Saint Iames, And he from thee will flie. Or else how did good Ioseph he Susanna and the rest, Withstand all filthines of sin and whoredome still detest. To passe by this I will proceede, and bend my speech more plaine: To you whom I respect in heart, in which I doe not faine. Because I meane to knit my selfe, In marriage as I said: I did bethinke my selfe where I, Might find some honest maid. That I might wooe and take to wife, In wedlocke to liue so As that I might not grieue my friends nor yet reioyce my foes. And still my mind did runne on you, as fittest match for me: Among you madens in these parts, Or any I can see, You are no gadding gosseper; No proud nor peacocke dame: No night bird walker as some are That liue not in good fame. No stage play runner nor no shrew, Of shrill or pratling tongue: No scould nor brawler or stout peice, That hurts both old and yong. No selfe wild person sowre or crosse, To please or to intreate: No idle houswife or the like, That can but play and eate. No sweet mouth'd triffles, longing still, For all things farre or neere: And with the first to craue ripe fruite, Though it be scarce and deere. I know that you can reade and write, Yea sing and sweetly play On instruments of sundry sorts For your delight all way. The needle, and the loome also, You handle cunningly The knitting needles of all sorts Your fingers can apply. Yet this doth nothing hinder you, From wheele and distaffe plaine: Which is the mistris sport sometimes, And is not without gaine. I know that you liue soberly, Content with meane estate: Abhorring pride and vanities To liue at simple rate. A great Paines taker in an house; For all works that belong: To women sexe both small and great, Though you not very strong. All this doth come from God aboue, For you liue in his feare: And Parents haue tooke paines with you Which: winnes praise every where. Blessed and happy is that man; Which can winne loue of thee: Or of thy like in some good part, Though some should wanting be. I pray you now to vnderstand, That all my words doe tend: To get your favour and your loue, In Marriage or Lend. And for my selfe you know me well, I am a neighbours sonne: And you a neighbours daughter are, You know then whence I come. I must not prayse my selfe at all My deedes and godly men; Shall be sufficient in this point, Wherefore I spare my Pen. Yet giue me leaue a word or two, In things that all know not: Concerning me my life and state: Which may fall to thy lot. I feare and worship God on hie, And what the scripture saith: That I beleeue unfainedly, And there on build my faith. All po-pe-ry I doe detest, With Sects and Schismes all: In Christ and his Apostles words, I stay and euer shall. Now my profession sure it is, Befitting your degree: Which may induce thy heart to loue, And thinke the more on me. I am no vnthrift any way, No prodigall or such: No Naball niggard Churll or Clowne, At kindred for to grutch. I am no cosening cogging knaue, No shifter vile or base: No drunkard whoremaister or theefe, That dares not shew their face. I am no slothfull or drone Bee, To sucke away the honey: That other men haue laboured for, I owe no debts nor mony, I stand not bound in suretieship, For any man aliue: I take no goods or wares on trust, For then I should not thriue. I brag it not in brokers suites Of veluet, silke, or Sattine: VViddowes or maydens to deceiue, By tongue that runnes on pattine. I meddle not with vserers, That eate men out of all Lands, goods, and leases, paunes, and what May bring a mans great fall. I follow my vocation still, And on the Sabboth day: VVith all my seruants goe to Church To heare gods word and pray. House, land, and mony some I haue, My parents left it me: Enough to bring a woman to, If married I should be. And something I haue purchast since, If children I should haue That they in time may be possest, Of that we get or saue, What wealth you haue I doe not know, Nor will I that enquire, It is sufficient if you like, and all I doe desire. Our Parents thine and mine are dead, Else would I out of hand: Make suit to them for their good wills, as Gods word doth command. But seeing God hath called them, And you at liberty: To marry whom you will in God, That course now stay will I. But if that you haue other men, In such a worke to use: There good aduise I wish you take, And doe it not refuse. The better euery thing shall goe, With you and eke with me: For that with good advise this worke, Our friends shall euer see. Now will I draw vnto an end, Till I may heare from you; What hope there may be of my suite, Or what shall now ensue. The Lord direct your heart aright, That I thine owne may be: If God hath so ordained it, And thus farewell to thee. Your louing friend, your friend indeede That will not faile: in time of neede. A. B. FINIS. Certaine verses or English Meeters concerning locking in of our doors at Night and of opening them in the Morning with prayer, and then of following some lawfull vocation or other. To the Tune of the 25. Psalme. At night thy doores shut in, With Prayer to the Lord, Repent and leaue thy sinnes betimes, And so escape the sword. For one day we shall count, For thoughts for words for deedes; Therefore let not the soule of thine, Be pestered with such weedes. No quiet can there be, To them that sleepe in sinne: And are not reconciled to God, By Christ our helpe therein. When Morning doth appeare, And thou intendst to rise: Prayse God for thy good rest and sleepe, and shake of slothfull guise. Vnlocke thy doores againe, With prayer as before: And willingly take paines some way, In goodnesse euermore. For they that liue at ease, And have no calling knowne, Liue not a Christian life be sure, Though they liue on their owne. As theeues such are to God, And to his Children deare: The slothfull idle spending life, Is no way in Gods feare. If thou be but a childe, At schoole let be thy worke: And doe not lose thy golden time, In corners for to lurke. If thou a seruant be, A man or else a mayde: Doe that which doth belong to thee, To sinne be thou afraid. If Gentleman or Knight, Or if young Lord thou be: Let study good and exercise, Be pleasant unto thee, Thy house thy name and wealth, Will else be ouer throwne: And thou a man of no esteeme When thy bad life is knowne. The streets of euery Towne, are to to full each day: Of idle and vnthrifty men, That seekes their owne decay, The Lord our God amend, This sinne and all the rest: That now doth raigne in Englishmen For God doth it detest. FINIS. A song in praise of Musicke against all Stoickelike Natures. Which may be sung to the Tune of: In Greate when Dedalus. The Poets write in Musickes praise, That Orpheus with his tuned Harpe The stones could moue the trees could raise And make the warbling Birds to carpe, And all to shew that Musickes art Can mollifie a stony heart. The silly infants mournfull cry The fostering Nurse with songs doth stay, The Ploughmans whistling melody Doth passe away the painefull day The horse and Mule with sound of bell. Encouraged is to labour well. The Head enfraught with frantike toies The tuned strings doe make full graue: The heart opprest and voide of ioy. Will greatly ioy Musicke to haue When studie deepe hath duld the braine Musicke will sharpe the edge againe. We read how Dauid plaid full trimme Before the holy Arke of God And how his wife for mocking him By sentence iust was then forbod For hauing Children any more But barren should she be therefore. The shepheards and the Angels eke When that our Sauiour Christ was borne With voice did laud that lambe so meeke That died for mankind without scorne We ought to praise the Lord also VVith musicks art in wealth and woe. A song well set well sung with voice, Or other musicke handled fine. Farre passeth any earthly noyse Yea rather is a thing divine. And some doe writ that Musicke euen Doth represent the ioyes of heauen. Since Musick is a science such, That God will honoured be withall A fish and fowle ioyes therein much And euery thing to nature thrall Hath he not then a stony heart That can dispraise this noble art. Loue Musicke therefore in her use Loue Poetry void of abuse Heare songs and Instruments somtimes So as they lead not to ill crimes And thus an end of Musicks praise VVhich God aduance in all our dayes. FINIS. A song in commendation of diuers instruments of Musicke. Praise the Lord O man mortall Night and day upon him call Sing and say both great and small That God is good and iust: Search and seeke the Scripture well It doth testifie and tell Euery one in ioy shall dwell. That in the Lord doth trust. Take the sounding Trumpet shrill Tabrell and the sweete Timbrill Winde the Flute with right good will, That Saints on earth may heare: Let the Drummer strike amaine, Till our spirituall foes be slaine Then with ioy retire againe, And serue the Lord in feare. Bring the Bandora to blay, Let the Bumberd come and Bray Put not Dulcimers away Nor pipes that praise the Lord, Send the Cinfan and Simball Sacbuts long and virginall Let the Lute and Citterns small Agree with one accord. Heare the Crumpehorne and the Harpe Hoboise and the Regale sharpe Let the Vialls come and carpe Our minds for to delight. Sing with Shalmes and Psaltery Play vpon the Organes hie Cause the Cornets for to crie In skillfull peoples sight. Learne in Gods word how you may Vse these Instruments in play Putting the abuse away That wicked men doe use. Let your mirth and Musicke, still Be according to Gods will Carnall lust for euer kill On good things alwayes muse. March with Moses valiantly Answer Miriam singingly After Israels victorie On Pharaoh and his hoast: Ioy with ioyfull Iaell shee Debora and Baruck hee VVho did Siseras downfall see Of whom there was much boast. Brittaine thinke on things of waight Spaniards comming eighty eight VVith the Powder plot conceipt VVhereof all sorts should tast Dally not with God therefore Trust not Papists any more, Banish them that blessings store, May come to vs in hast. Their Sinnes of Idolla-try Our Sinnes of impiety Both of them to God doth cry For vengeance night and day Let vs therefore now repent And all our sinfull wayes lament Let our minds to good be bent And we shall liue for aye. FINIS. A song against Fortune and those that haue or doe defend the same, which may be sung to the Tune of: Fortune my foe, why dost thou frowne on me. Fortune shall be no God nor guide of mine, Fortune to thee, nothing I will resigne: Fortune thou art the heathens Queene and Princesse How should a Christian take thee for his Mistres. Fortune some say shee hath restles wheele, Turning the same that men her power may feele Fortune doth giue; and take life as a Huntresse, Thus euery way; is Fortune tooke for Mistres. But shall I shew the folly of this thing? And credit haue if I the truth doe bring Then giue me leaue, &amp; I will proue this Heathnesse To be no God desse Princesse Queene or Mistresse Fortune what is it who can tell or shew? It is no God nor Angell this we know: No man nor woman, no creature dumbe or senceles, No vice nor vertue to be made a Princesse. What world or worke did Fortune mike or frame? What law or Gospel comes forth in her name? Whom doth shee call to count with as a Princesse? Where will shee raigne when this worlds turnd to ashes? Seeth no man can define what Fortune is, Nor yet declare, her workes of bale or Hisse: Seeth none did ever see or know this Princesse, Why should a christian take her for his Mistres? In God therefore, that made both Sea and land, Heaven, earth, and all things with his mightie hand In him alone, the father of all mercies, I put my trust aboue all earthly Princes. Fortune and Fancy, Hazz and Happe and chance Venture and Destiny, Lucke and ignorance, God will destroy and call account of Princesse, Of young and old, of servants and of Mistres. Fortune ye see then, is but euen a name, Which Heathen Nations, to themselues did frame: Of prophane people, only shee is Princesse, And therefore christians should haue no such Mistres. Where God is knowne and truely knowne indeed, There Fortunes name, is banisht with all speed: Yea all grosse sinne, which doth our God offend, Which thing I prayse, and so my song shall end. FINIS. A song or Ditty made on this theame I know not what, wherein is shewed how men ought not to set their mindes on worldy pleasure but on the living Lord. To the tune of Labandalashot: and doth runne on the names of them that gaue the theame, and his that made the song. VVho viewes the life of mortall man His state and where of he began: Shall find such hugy heapes of woe, As neither tongue nor penne can show: Wherewith our mindes should daunted bee From vsing worldly mirth and glee And mooue vs to consider well: What paines here are prepar'd in hell For wicked people as their lot which haue done heare they know not what. If euerie man would heare Gods word, and reuerently obey the Lord: Then wickednesse would not abound, But grace and vertue would be found In yong and old in hie and low In servants and in childre'n also In rich and poore in great and small In preachers and in people all Who delight in this and that And often doe they know not what. Looke round about in each degree And marke what crimes and faults we see Behold the court and country too And then note well what great adoe There is in euery kind of state Few are content with simple rate But euery one will clime aloft Till triall hath them plainely taught Tis vaine in hope of this or that To say or doe they know not what. Loue is not found but here and there, Lieud lust doth flourish euery where: Good lawes are made but kept at will, Loose living it increaseth still. Like swine we wallow in the mire, And seeke to follow vaine desire: Let God or man say what they please We hunt for pleasure wealth and ease, And for the loue of this and that: We say and doe we know not what. In pompe and pride we doe excell, Like Lucifer the Diuell of hell: All new found fashions we doe craue, To make our bodies fine and braue, But for our soules we little care, Small suites for it we doe prepare: We gard and lace vs round about, In Iigges and Iagges we let it out. Some will weare this, some will weare that, And some will weare they know not what. All whordome is but trickes of youth, Say those that doe not know the truth: Not one of twentie when they wed, Doe bring vnto the Marriage bed, Their bodies pure as Christians ought, But fleshly pleasure first is sought: And for to cloake their filthy deed They must be married with all speede. Then they doe liue like Dog and Cat, Because they did they knew not what. Much swearing many a one doth vse, And so the Name of God abusce Some sweard by wounds, by blood and heart, By foote by sides and euery part By Masse by crosse by light by fire By bread and all we can desire. By faith and troth though they haue none By Saints and Angels many a one, Some sweare by this, some sweare by that, And some doe sweare they know not what. Fie on the drowsie drunken sort, that in excesse delight and sport: Fie on all ale-knights that will quaffe, to make men drunk when they may laugh Fie on all potmates that delight, to serue God Bacchus day and night. To them belongs red eyes and nose, to them belongs the ragged cloathes For they still drinke of this and that vntill they doe they know not what. O when will covetousnes be left, with fraud and guile deceit and theft: Or when will vsurie take his flight, with flattery falshood craft and spight, When shall the poore in good state liue, by helpes and gifts that rich men giue: When will our land-Lords be content, to let their Farmes at the old rent. Alas they cannot heare of that, But they would haue they know not what. See how the Sabboth is abus'd, and all good exercise refus'd: O see what pastimes men deuise, to please their carnall eares and eies. Few take delight to heare Gods word, but like bruite beasts they rise from board: To daunce to boule to gaud and game, though preachers oft reprooue the same. Some follow this, some follow that, and some doe follow they know not what. The Dice and Cardes esteemed be, of rich and poore we daily see: Till all is gone there is no stay, but at the Dice it must away. The married man the Batcheler, the prentice and the traueler: They follow gaming earnestly, vntill they come to beggery. Examples draw them not from that, but still they doe they know not what. Enfor'st I am to tell you plaine, what sinnes among us still remaine: That true repentaance may abound, while God in mercy may be found. For time will come when we shall say, what fooles we were to goe astray: And if we knock t'will be too late, for we shall answered be at gate. Depart from hence I know you not, which haue done here you know not what Repentance God doth not denie, if we doe aske before we die: And put not of from time to time, th' amendment of each fault and crime. And marke also what things are taught, and print them in your mind and thought Beat downe your wills with wit and grace, and foster not in any case: Your leude attempts to this or that, but in Gods word learne what is what. In humble sort pray we, pray we, vnto one God and persons three: O let vs magnifie his name, and sound out praises to the same. He hath given vs as may be seene, a royall King, a Prince and Queene. Nothing we lacke in these our dayes, wherefore let vs walke in his wayes Regarding neither this nor that: but seeke to know still what is what. Here will I knit vp and conclude, now will I end my verses rude O you that are disposed to sing, to read or heare this simple thing: Desire of God and so will I: That we may profit well hereby Euen for his sonne Christs Iesus sake, to whom let us our selues betake. So shall all neuer be forgot, for he will teach vs what is what. FINIS. A song against slaunderous tongues shewing that no sort of good men did or euer could escape them. Who so thou be that liuest best, and least of all deseruest blame, That would'st passe through aboue the rest, this world without reproch and shame. Come marke and see and credit me, all slanderous tongues would trouble thee If thou could'st walke with God himselfe, as Henoch did Noah by name; If Shem and Iaphets bashfullnes, were thine in hiding fathers shame. Yet marke and see and credit me: all slanderous tongues would trouble thee. If thou had'st Abra'ms faith and trust, with Isa'kes Iacobs and that traine: If Iosephs chastity thou hadst, and prouidence for countryes gaine. Yet marke and see and credit me, all slanderous tongues, would trouble thee. If like to Deborah thou could'st be, to Iael Baruck and the best: To Gideon and to Ieptha he, to Samson stronger than the rest. Yet marke and see and credit me all slanderous tongues would trouble thee. If thou hadst Samuels righteousnes, with Dauids harpe and holines: The loue of Ionathan and those, that Saule the king tooke for his foes. Yet marke and see and credit me: all slanderous tongues would trouble thee. If thou in princely seat did'st sit, to rule the Realme, with golden mace If thou were Solomon in wit, and cam'st of hie renowned race. Yet marke and see and credit me, all slanderous tongues will trouble thee. If thov had'st all the cunning skill, that euer learned man could haue: If thou in godly exercise, spend'st time untill thou goest to grave: Yet marke and see and credit me, all slanderous tongues will trouble thee. If thou had'st all King Cressus gold, and daily did'st the poore relieve: If God and nature had bestow'd, on thee all gifts that they could give. Yet marke and see and credit me, all slanderous tongues will trouble thee. If thou to Marriage giv'st thy minde, a number then their fancies say: Some like it well, some fault will finde, and some will dash it if they may. In this good worke still credit me, all slanderous tongues will trouble thee. If Virgin-like thou mean'st to live, or if a Maiden course thou take: If publike, or if private life, if lay or Clergie man thou make. Yet marke and see and credit me, all slandrous tongues will trouble thee. Was not our Saviour Christ thus us'd of Iewish people to his face: Were not the Prophets so abus'd, and the Apostles in like case: What good men now among us bee, that have from slandrous tongue bin free. Then to conclude seeth it is so, that slandrous tongues all sorts will bite: Let faith and patience be thy guide, and let the Lord give them their right: Till then pray thou to God with me, to mend those tongues that slandrous be. FINIS. A song or ditty, shewing the nature of the ambitious, and what is true happinesse, namely to live as that we may make a good end before death. The happy life in these our dayes, That all doth seek both small and great: Is who may gaine, or win the prayse, or who may sit in highest seat: But in this life happ what happ shall, the happy end exceedeth all. A good beginning oft we see, but seldome standeth at one stay: For few doe like the meane degree, then prayse at parting some men say, To death seeth euery one is thrall: the happy end exceedeth all. To be as wise as Cato was, or rich as Cressus in his life: To haue the strength of Hercules, which did subdue by force and strife, What helpeth it when Death doth call: the happy end exceedeth all. The longer life that we desire, the more offence doth daily grow: The greater paine it doth require, except the Lord some pitty shew. Wherefore I thinke and euer shall: the happy end exceedeth all. The rich my well the poore releeue, the rulers may redresse much wrong: The learned can good counsell giue, but marke the end of this my song. Who shewes good fruites happy I call, his happy end exceedeth all. FINIS. A song in dispraise of spight and enuie. To the tune of: Now leaue and let me rest. VVhen spight hath spent his worst, and malice wrought his will Then truth will trie the iust, and sift the good from ill. Though truth may hap be blamed, by spight and spightfull parts, Yet truth shall not be shamed, for all their spightfull hearts. For truth will trie it selfe, at length with honest fame: When that the spightfull elfe, shall hide his head for shame Spight is a spightfull sin, with falshood to preuaile A spightfull fained friend, hath poyson in his tayle. Spight spies out spightfull wayes, a true man to deface, And laughs when he decayes, such is his spightfull grace. Yet speake out spight and spare not, to spend thy spight dispatch, For all thy spight I care not, nor for no spightfull wratch. For when thy spight is spent, and truth shall come in place: Then shame thy selfe shall shent, and shew thy, shamefull face. For truth shall still prevaile, in spight of spights ill minde: Though spight spightfully rayles, as curres that bite behinde. God sendes them all mis-chance, that spends such spightfull drosse, With falshood to advance, themselues with others losse. For spight I little care, let spight spie out his worst: And make of spight no spare, for in truth will I trust. Sith truth did never faile, at length for his defence: Against wrong to prevaile, for all his false pretence. Vse falshood they that list, in earnest or in gaine: A false man never mist, for falshood to haue shame. A sorrowfull song or sonnet, wherin is lamented our miserable estate in this life hunting after vanity. To the tune of Labandalashot. To view the state of mans vnrest, I muse oft times in mournfull brest: What causeth him by sundry wayes, to seeke for worldly pelfe and praise. What hope, what helpe, what tried trust, what ioy or stay in things vniust, What sureance haue we here to bide? we come and goe as doth the tide: And yet we take felicitie, to loue this worldly vanitie. How many mischiefes may befall, vpon thy head O man mortall? When thou in ioy and iollitie, doest little thinke of miserie. Great heapes of heavie harmefull haps, doth lucklesly light in our laps: The snatching snare of death is spread, and man on so daine is strooke dead: Yea tract of time doth plainly try, this world to be but vanitie. O wicked Diues man of mold, that hadst all pleasures twentie fold: Th' abuse thereof doth record beare, that thou wouldst not impart nor spare One farthing to the fatherlesse, nor needie neighbors in distresse: Can riches bring thee backe againe, out of this place of plunging paine: Where thou in woefull waues must lie, bereft of worldly vanitie. My mind is much dismayd to see both high and low of each degree: How cunningly their parts they play, as though this world should last for aye: The king in higher place would sit: the subiect thinkes himselfe most fit, To rule and raigne in regall seat, that in the fight of small and great, He may be seene to sit on hie amidst this worldly vanitie. All good advise and counsell graue, which we in memory should haue, Is cast into oblivion and cleane forgot of euery man; Examples rare of Gods iudgement, will not procure vs to repent: His benefits we doe abuse, his sacred word we doe refuse, His mercies powred plenteously, we doe reiect for vanitie. Such lawlesse Lawyers some there be, that pleades on both sides as wee see: For many makes the matter sure, and maister Mendax will procure, That you shall be dispatcht with speed: if you can helpe him at his need: These prating parasites God knowes, which in the silly sheepe-skin goes: Deceiueth men by flatterie, and all for worldly vanitie. Prepend the life of merchants eke, how ventrously at sea they seeke, For their advantage many miles, and then with sundry worldly wiles: The simple sort they doe deceiue, and so the web of sin thy weaue: For that with othes and count'nance made, the country people they perswade: All ware is good of honestie, when it is worse then vanitie. If we would thinke vpon our state, and in our selues be at debate: A remedie there might be found, to beat our sinnes vnto the ground, But we in wantonnesse doe spend, our life and liuings to the end: And hauocke makes such wast and spoyle, that Lazers poore doe starue the while: In stead of hospitalitie, is Bacchus bankets of gluttonie. Could swinish Sodom liue more ill, and be so bent to wanton will: Or could Gommorra truly say, that we liue not so ill as they, If we be iudge our selues herein, yet must we looke to sinke for sinne: Our carelesse life calls to the Lord, for vengeance great of fire and sword: We haue no care to liue godly, but to delight in vanitie. From friends to flatterers we come, from God to godlesnesse we runne: Of whoredome now is nothing made, and drunkennnsse is no ill trade. We iest it out when we defame, our neighbours nothing worthy blame Vpon suspect reuenge we will, what so we doe it is not ill: To beare false witnesse wrongfully, some are content for vanitie. Of sacred scriptures we will none, for we can read the same at home: Of ministers we haue no care, we doe deride them here and there: We loathe their learned exhortations, which should be for our owne saluations, Such like reprochfull words some vse, Gods messengers for to abuse: For they reprooue their iollitie, and say it is but vanitie. Refraine the fantasies deere friends, aske mercy for your former sinnes Accompt this world to be but lent, praise God and alwayes be content: His benefits both great and small, we must giue reckning for them all: Our time is short right well we know, and none is sure when he shall goe: With speed then let's prepare to die, for sure this word is vanitie. Death is the end of mortall life, and death doth cease all worldly strife: He bridles vp the brainsicke foole, and doth dispute in fancies schoole, Where dainty damsels he doth meet, and laps them all in shrowding sheet: All Adams amorous impes beside, which decke themselues in pomp &amp; pride: With vgly face most tufully, he takes them from their vanity. If I might moue the minde of man, onely in heart to way and scan: How I haue now in verse displaid, nothing but truth in that is sayd. Repentance sure with teares would call, helpe Lord forgiue thy people all: O guide our steps still with thy word, deliuer us from euill good Lord, Inflame our hartes with ioyes on hie, so shall we hate all vanitie. In this song we are put in mind of our fraile and weake estate, and we are taught how to lull and bring asleepe our affections that we may goe to God. To the tune of the 15. Psalme. Sing lullaby as women doe, wherewith they bring their babes to rest: And lulaby can I sing too, as womanly as can the best. With lulaby the child they still, with sugred songs they sing out shrill: Such wanton babes God knowes have I, that must be stild with lulaby. First lulaby my youthfull yeares, it is now time to goe to bed: For crooked age and hoarie haires, haue wonne the haven in my head. With lulaby then youth be still, with lulaby subdue thy will: Sith courage quailes and comes behind, goe sleepe and so beguile thy mind. Next lulaby my wanton playes, let reasons rule restraine thy thought: Since that I finde by sundry wayes, how deere thou hast thy sporting bought. With lulaby take thou thine ease, with lulaby thy dumps appease: Blest is that wight which ere he die, doth sing aright this lulaby. Now lulaby my gasing eyes, that wonted were to glance apace, For every glasse may now suffice, to shew the furrowes in my face. With lulaby then winke a while, with lulaby thy lookes beguile: Let no faire face nor beauty bright, entice thee vnto vaine delight. And lulaby my body eke, which once was clad in trim attire Warme furs to cloth thee now goe seeke, in chayer keepe thee by the fire. And lulaby let some man sing. while thou to God doest make reckning: Prepare thy selfe alwayes to dye, forget not this my lulaby. With lulably then bring asleepe, dispaire which commeth by mistrust: And Sathans doubts which faine would creep into our hearts that are but dust. Put confidence in Gods mercy, and euermore sing lulaby: Commit thy selfe to Christ alone, with him to ioy when life is gone. Last lulaby in graue we make, amidst the greedy wormes in clay: Vntill that Christ accompt shall take, of euery one at the last day. Wherefore let vs sing lulaby, till all his sinnes sleepe quietly: And then to God make hast away, in heauen with him to liue for aye. The lamentable mone of a sorrowfull soule. In trouble thus I heard one cry, Vpon his knees with weeping eye, Saying, O whither should I flie, Where might I wish my selfe to be, That God take no account of me. For why my sinnes are growne so great, That if I come to iudgement seat, In vaine it is for to intreat, A place therefore to hide me in, I craue by reason of my sinne. If in the heauens I seeke to be, There must I needes be seene of thee, In hell is no defence for me, Thy presence fills each place I know, In heauen aboue and earth below, If I had wings at will to flie, Beyond the seas that farthest lie: Yet there thy hand and power is nie, To bind and bring me backe againe: In place where I should still remaine. Thou doest possesse me every whit, My heart my raines my head my wit, My sinewes that my joynts doe knit, Thou broughtst me from my mothers womb, And thou shalt raise me from my tomb. Thy passing power thy workes declare, Thy threats shew what thy terrors are, Thou seest all secrets every where, My soule therefore that is in woe, Alas then whether shall it goe? As I was in this great distresse, One spake and sayd to me doubtlesse: Despaire not man through heavinesse, For God delighteth not to see, The death of sinners credit me. By faith on these words I tooke hold, And yet I durst not be too bold, But tremblingly as one acold, I prayd and gaue God thankes withall: For comfort in such wo full thrall. And thus I was received well, As one releast from paines of hell, My horror sute no tongue can tell, Those pinching paines that I did feele: Would surely breake an heart of steele. A Christian promise then made I, And vow'd a vow to God on hie, That from henceforth continually, His faithfull servant I will be: Which to performe Christ strengthen me. You sinners obstinate and ill, That daily doe resist Gods will, Giue eare now to my crying shrill. Amend your liues while you haue space, Or else you are in wofull case. For our good King now let us pray, The Lord preserue him night and day: His counsell eke God keepe for aye, This Realme good Lord saue and defend, From euery foe to the worlds end. A ditty declaring the fervent desire of a christian soule. To the tune of, O Lord of whom I doe depend. Sweete Iesus who shall giue me wings. of pure and perfect loue: That I may mount from earthly things, and rest with thee aboue. For heere beneath I flie about, in weake and weary case: Like to the Doue that Noe sent out, which found no resting place. Euen thou O Iesus by thy power, must giue me wings to flie: Else shall I neuer know thy lure, to stoope obediently. Ne can I rise off from the fist, of worldly pleasures vaine But stubbornely thy will resist, to mine eternall paine. My wearie wings sweete Iesus marke, and grant me my request: Put forth thy hand out of thine Arke, and take me to thy rest. For sure with thee are endlesse ioyes, and no man there laments: But here with vs are great annoyes, whereof each one repents. In heauen thy Saints doe sing to thee, without all strife and feare: But we on earth at variance be, and subiect much to care. O beggerly conceipts and base, O toyes of deepe contempt: From which sweet Iesus by thy grace, my silly soule exempt. For I haue learn'd to loath those things, wherein I did delight: And unto thee the King of kings, I come with all my might: Craving a place with thy great host, where I may sing alwayes: To Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, all honour laud and praise. Two most excellent songs or Ditties, made by Queene Elizabeth, as it is credibly reported (and as it is very likely by some words in it) in the yeare 1588. When the Spaniard came to possesse this land and is in manner of a prayer to God. Deliver me O Lord my God, from all my foes that be: And eke defend all Christian soules, that put their trust in thee. Preserve us now and evermore, from all the wicked traine, Who long and thirst for Christians bloud, and neuer will refraine. Mine enemies O Lord be strong and thou the same dost know: And that without offence in me, they seeke mine ouerthrow. My hope and helpe in all distresse, hath euer beene in thee: And thou, O Lord, of thy goodnesse, didst still deliuer me. Come now and end this strife likewise, the cause is wholly thine: Wherfore to thee my selfe and suite, I wholly doe resigne. The other song of Queene Elizabeth made in manner of a thankesgiuing to God for her and our deliverance from the inuincible Nauie of the Spaniard (as he termed it) which thanks and praise was performed at Saint Pauls crosse in London. Looke and bow downe thine eare O Lord, from thy bright spheare behold and see Thy handmaid and thy handy worke, among thy Priests offring to thee. Ecco's resounding vp the skies: my selfe and scepter sacrifice, My soule ascend his holy place, ascribe him strength, and sing him prayse: For hee restraineth Princes spirits, and hath wrought wonders in our dayes. He made the windes and waters rise: and did destroy mine enemies. This Iacobs head, this Israels God, the fiery piller and the cloud: Which kept the Saints from Pharoahs rod, and drencht the honour of the proud: He hath preserued now in loue, the soule of me his turtle doue. A Carroll for Christmas day To the tune of Rogeero. VVe come to sing of Christ our King, According to the time, Therefore prepare and giue good eare, Let hearts and all incline. Divinitie our cheife Story, which speakes of mans Saluation: Shewes that the Lord by his pure word, made all good by creation. Mankind did beare Gods Image faire, the creatures all were blest: Then sathans evill made him a divell, and he gave man small rest. But tempted him by Eva's sinne, till Paradice was gone: Thus they and we were left you see, in fearefull state each one. Then God above in tender love, to men that was but dead: Said that indeed the womans feed, should breake the Serpents head. To Abraham to Isaack then, to Iacob, and the Iewes: A covenant sure aye to endure, God made of this good newes. Before their eyes in Sacrifice, our Saviour was displayd, In figure, types and other rites: on Altar he was laid. To Priests, to Kings were shew'd these things to Prophets and the rest: Who did assure that Virgin pure, should beare this heavenly guest, Realmes now in peace all warres did cease Iohn Baptist came to preach: And he likewise did some baptize, that heard when he did teach. The time full come God sent his Sonne, in shape of sinfull flesh: Thus God and man one Christ became, our soules for to refresh. Angels did bring newes of this thing, to Shepheards in the night: To whom they said be not afraid, at this so heavenly sight. But goe your way and make no stay, Christ is at Bethelem: Behold him there borne poore and bare, for sinne of mortall men. Then gloriously from heaven hie, the Angels they did sing: Praise to Gods name, peace without blame, on earth to men living. Shepheards did goe and found it so, as Angels had foretold: Christ meekly lay swadled in hay, within the stable cold. This child he is our soules cheife blisse, our tree of life and all. Our Abell slaine our Isaack plaine, our Ioseph left in thrall. Our paschall lambe that hether came, for his deere Spouse to die, Our Manna sweet our Rocke so deepe, our Arke of Sanctuarie. Our mercy Seate our altar great, ou Lampe and lauor faire, Our priest our King and euery thing, that we might not despaire. What thankes and praise in all our daies, ought we and ours to giue, Vnto Gods name that wrought the same, Long time ere man did liue. This is the day of our great ioye, if we will ioy therein: And not assigne this blessed time, to vanitie and sinne. But euermore in vertues store, to spend our daies aright, Which God grant vs through Christ Iesus, to doe with all our might. Another Carroll for Christmas day: made as if it were spoken by Christ to Adam and his posteritie. Remember O thou man, O thou man, O thou man Remember O thou man, thy time mis-spent, Remember O thou man how thou camst to me than, And I did what I can, therefore repent. Remember Adams fall, O thou man, O thou man, Remember Adams fall from heaven to hell: Remember Adams fall, how we were condemn'd all To hell perpetuall there for to dwell. Remember Gods goodnes O thou man O thou man Remember Gods goodnes, and promise made, Remember Gods goodnes, his son should come doubt lesse Our faults for to redresse, bee not afraide. The Angels all did sing, O thou man, O thou man, The Angels all did sing on the Shepheards hill, The Angels all did sing praise to our heauenly king, And peace to man living with a good will. The Shepheards amazed was, O thou man, O thou man The Shepheards amazed was to heare Angels sing. The Shepheards amazed was, how that should come to passe That Christ our Mesias should be our King. To Bethelem do they goe, O thou man, O thou man To Bethelem doe they goe these Shepheards three, To Bethelem doe they goe, to see if that were so, That Christ were borne or no to set us free. As the Angels before did say, O thou man, O thou man, As the Angels before did say it came to passe: As the angels before did say, they fo?d the babe wher it lay, In manger wrapped in hay, so poore it was Give thanks to God alway, O thou man, O thou man Give thankes to God alway with hearts most jolly, Give thanks to God alway for this most joyfull day, Let all men sing and say, Holy, Holy, Holy. A Carroll for S. Stephens day. The holding of the same. O Lord our God poure downe thy grace, and holy Spirit from heauen: That we may celebrate aright, Christs birth as did Saint Stephen. The Dittie it selfe. When Iesus Christ ascended was, into the heavens hie: His twelve Apostles spent much time, in praying earnestly. And when the holy Ghost was sent, they preached bold by skill: The word of God in every place, according to his will. The number of the Church increas'd, and grew exceedingly: So that the Apostles lacked helpe, in that their ministrie. Wherefore they chose seuen worthy men, of good report and fame: That tooke the almes vp for the poore, the blind, the halt, and lame: Saint Stephen that worthy Martyr he, was one of them they chose: A man full of the holy Ghost, against whom there arose. A proud sect of the Libertines, that did euuie him sore: Still seeking him to persecute, that he should speake no more. They hyred some to sweare and say, that Stephen spake blasphemie: Against the Lord and Moses law, for which he ought to die. Then to the Counsell he was brought, to purge him of that crime: Which thing he did most worthily, before them at that time. When they had heard these words and saw, he feared not the chiefe: Their hearts for anger burst and they, gnasht on him with their teeth. They gaue a shout with voyces loud, and lead him straight away: Then did they stone him unto death, yet he for them did pray. O Lord forgiue their sinne (quoth he) and doe my soule still keepe: Vpon his knees he prayed thus, and so did fall a sleepe. Such patience grant to us (O Lord) and eke such constancie, When for thy truth or otherwise, we shall be brought to die. A Carroll for Saint Iohns day. The holding of the same. Before the Lord now let vs sing, with all the ioy we can: That we may rightly celebrate, Christs birth with good Saint Iohn. The Carroll it selfe. According to Gods promise made, in mercy to Mankind, Christ Iesus came into the world, as we in Scripture find. Of whom the Prophets prophecied, long time ere he was sent: That he should be a Sauiour, to all that doe repent. Our Sauiour Christ both God and man, when these things ended were: And he had led his life on earth, the space of thirtie yeere. He did begin to call the twelue, and taught them earnestly: To preach his fathers will in all. the Regions faire and nie. And as he walked by the Sea, he saw both Iumes and Iohn: The sonnes of simple Zebedie, who was a fisher-man. Christ called them and they forthwith, obeyed him and came: Wherefore Apostles they were made, to preach still in his name. Saint Iohn was borne by mothers side, of great and royall stocke: Though he were once a fisher-man; and after fed Christs flocke. He came of Mary Sallome, of Davids braunch most cleere, And Sister to the Virgin pure, that bare our Saviour deere. The words of this Euangelist, hath sounded euery where: Vnto the comfort of all those, that serue the Lord in feare. Wherefore let vs with cheerefull hearts, sing prayses to Gods name: And in our Christian life like John, still imitate the same. FINIS. A Carroll for Innocents Day. The holding of the Carroll. VVeeping &amp; mourning there was heard in Rama did complaine: That wofull woman Rachel shee, her children they were slaine. The words of the Carroll it selfe. When that th' eternall Sonne of God, by providence diuine, Into this sinfull world did come, mankind for to redeeme. Then Bethelem Iuda thought her selfe, thrise happy and thrise blest: That shee was found a worthy place, to lodge that heauenly guest. Wise-men there came from the East parts, to worship this yong King, Farre they had seene his starre appeare: which did foretell this thing. VVhen Herod heard of this strange newes, O he was troubled sore: And all Hierusalem with him, they were in an vprore. He called the Priests and asked them, where this great King should be: They answered at Bethelem, if he would search and see. In secret then did Herod call, the wise men vnto him: To know what time the starr appeared, of this the new borne king. And when he knew the certaintie, he bid the wisemen goe, And bring him word that he might come, and worship him also. But in a dreame God warned them, the King not to obey: Wherefore as they returned home, they went another way. When Herod knew of this he said, this yong King I will quaile: Ten thousand for his sake shall die: with blood I will prevaile. The Infants young of two yeares old, by Herods campe were slaine: Their guiltlesse soules God hath receiu'd in Heauen with him to raigne. To Ioseph then an Angell spake, in sleepe as we may read: Saying take Mary and the child, and hast away with speede. To Nazareth then was Iesus brought and there he nursed was: Vntill such time as he was cal'd, vnto an other place. A Carroll for New yeares day setting out vnto vs the true circumcision of the heart, with out the which the circumcision of the outward members was of none effect. To the tune of any ordinary Psalme. Reioyce we in the Lord our God, for this ioyfull new yeare: And let our holinesse of life, from day today appeare. The law of Circumcision now, we humbly call to minde: Yeelding most hearty thanks therefore, to God that is so kind. He made his sonne our sauiour Christ, obedient to the law: For vs that disobedient were, and would not liue in awe. Not to the end we should abide, in sin as heretofore: But that we might repent and pray, henceforth to sinne no more. This law of circumcision first, God gaue to Abraham And to the fathers euery one long time before Christ came. As we haue Baptisme now in vse, so did they hold and keepe: This ordinance which was a signe, betweene God and his sheepe. The badge, the marke, the Sacrament, whereby all men did know: They were his chosen people then, and he their God also. The eight day after that their sonnes, into the world were borne. The Priests did circumcise them all, or else thy were forlorne. The foreskinne of their privie parts, with sharpe knife they did pare: And cald the children by that name, which then was given there. The women children were contain'd, vnder the males each one: Wherefore they gaue them not the signe, of circumcision. This signified and did set forth, unto the peoples view: The Circumcision of the heart, in all Gods children true, And this the Lord did oft recite, by all his prophets then: And in like sort by Preachers now, he shewes it to all men, That God may haue his honour due, and euery man his owne, That Iustice may be ministred, to make the truth well knowne. That helpe may still be granted to, the blinde the halt and lame: The prisoners that afflicted are, for Christ his truth and name. Then shall we tightly hold and keepe, this day cal'd New-yeares day: By putting euill out of our hands, the which God grant we may. To whom be honour, laud, and praise, from whom be given grace: To vs that we may magnifie, his name in euery place. The father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, that euer loued vs deere: Increase true amitie in vs, and send a good new yeere. A Carroll for Twelfe day. On the Feast of the Epiphanie. The holding of the Carroll. Christ manifested in the flesh, to Iewes and Gentiles all: Still shew himselfe to vs and ours, when we doe cry and call. The Carroll it selfe. This feast of Christs Epiphanie, or open setting out: Vnto beleeving Gentiles all, to put vs out of doubt. That he the God and Sauiour is, of Iewes and Gentiles too: And makes one people of them both, which none but he could doe. He now saluted is of kings. of Magies sage and wise: To Easterne Æthiopians, his starre did now arise. This starre it brought them to our Starre, in dawning of the day: I meane to Christ whose gospell bright, driues all darke clouds away. They offer first to him fine gold, to shew he is a King: They gaue him Frankincense, and Mirrh, which notes some other thing. That he was man and that he had, a sacrifice to giue: To God for all beleeuing soules, so long as men shall liue. Our spirituall King he is to rule, our Priest and sacrifice, Our Prophet for to teach vs all, till we be heauenly wise. O Lord giue grace to vs therefore, to yeeld obedience: To thee, and to thy holy Word, with all due reuerence. So shall we reape the fruits thereof, in heauen an other day: When we with God and Christ shall raigne, in euerlasting ioy. Vnto which ioy he bring vs all, that are of his elect And now accept of this our prayse, with mercifull respect. FINIS. A song reprouing Papistes for the Gunnepowder treason, and of our ioy and thankes-giving for our deliverance from that danger and all others. Reioyce England and ioy in him, that ioyes each Christian heart, With songs of prayses neuer linne, to laud him for your part, Oh set, oh sing, and sweetly play, Gods workes in verse and prose: Declare and shew from day to day, how he hath slaine our foes. Exalt Gods goodnes to this land, and to our late deare Queene: That worthy Ladie dead and gone in heauen still, to be seene. And now King Iames succeeds in place, these kingdomes for to sway: God graunt that his posteritie, may doe the like for aye. As troubles doe abide all men, so much more godly Kings: That doe the gospel still maintaine, and all the fruit it brings. King Iames hath oft in dangers beene, in Scotland as we know: In England at his comming in, he wanted not his foe. Yet God in wondrous wife did saue, and well deliver him: Yea made the Traytors to bewray, their owne-intended sinne. The cheife of them had their reward, at Winchester that Cittie When on some others of their crue, the King shewed royall pittie. But Sathan and his Impes sleepe not, new plots they still devise: As this which was of Gunpowder, apparant to our eyes: This hellish worke this strange deuise, surpassing all the rest: Hath left a forehead marke of them, that such we should detest. These wanted neither friends nor coyne, on euery side the seas: To bring this busines to passe, the Papistes hearts to please. And if some of their multitude, did neuer know of it: Which of them would refuse to haue, what others wonne by wit. All things with secrecie was kept, and they were readie now: To finish vp with stroke of strokes, their foule and wicked vow. But God bewrayed it on their houre, yea they one letter sent: Which op'ned all to King and state, and voyd was their intent. It was a woefull thing they sought, the cotting off of all: A bringing of this noble land, to beggery and thrall. I am astonisht many times, to thinke on the invention: And muse what men on earth there be, that like of this intention. Poore Protestants so cald in scorne, by Papists day and night: You neuer went with Massacres, the Papists to despight. For if you had then Papists throates, like trumpets shrill would be: To rayle and write in euery place, till your heart bloods they see. In blood at first they founded were, by blood thy liue and thriue: In blood they also grounded are, devouring men aliue. Yet once they must confounded be, in Gods great haruest day: Wherefore fly Romish Babylon, with all the speed you may. In the meane time let Christians striue, to serue the Lord on hie: Remembring each deliverance, with thankes continually. Lord looke on vs regard and heare, our prayers and our praise, And let our thankes appeare in life, abhorring sinfull wayes. Amen. A Game at Chesse with the Papists, or a Ditty made on that game against them and their evill practises. Ye Papists that can play at Chesse, and guide your men in battell ray: Your doings still doe well expresse, that you doe hope to haue a day. And yet as close as you can play, to check the King and all his state: It is foreseene to your decay, that check without neck of force is mate. Your pelting paune you thrust before, to make the way to worke your feate: Your knights and rookes you haue in store: your Queene and Bishop keepe their seat. Your king cat holly we may say, in Brittanie he would rule the state: No God nor man must say him nay, yet check without neck of force is mate. Your practise old to us well knowne, doth vrge the wise and godly race: Well to provide and saue their owne, and eke your treasons to deface. Although your paunes doe check his grace, the knights with neck set them agate, And did well waigh in time and place, that check without necke of force is mate. Your Iugling gins and sleights most sly, are no more seene then nose on face: And that in the'nd ye shall well try, when you doe hope they shall take place, You shall be forc't to runne apace, for that we watch early and late: Well to provide and haue in chase, that check without neck of force is mate. The check that you to vs haue sent, to necke most easly are alwayes: All though to checking you are bent, and we by necking win the praise. Now check saith Parsons and there staies, now neck saith Sutlife to thy pate: And gaue to them without delay, a passing pure and plaine checke mate. Although your learning will not serue, to giue to vs a checke indeed: From old practise you doe not swarue, your bloody hearts to fat and feed. Your powder plot makes all your seed, to be abhor'd of Church and state, For that there by all at one blow: you meant to vs, check and check mate. O Lord for Iesus Christ his sake, keepe cleane and pure thy church to th' end That we by faith may vndertake, all truth in thee to comprehend. Our King and realmes good Lord defend, against all those that would vs check: That we on thee may so depend: to haue alwayes a speedy neck. Amen. An exhortation to praise God for that worthy science and skill of Musick and for the great masters of the Art and their worthy workes. Praise God in whom only is found, the fulnes of all skill: And from whose wisdome floes the streame, of knowledge at his will. Praise him therefore for Musickes art, a science of the seaven, Which cheares the mindes of men on earth, and Ioyes the Saints in heauen. Praise him for Iubal and the rest, that first did find and frame: The ground and principles whereby, we teach and learne the same. Praise him for silver trumpets twaine, that he bad Moses frame: For Israels rising vp to traine, and resting by the same. Praise him for Davids booke of Psalmes, and for the songs of praise, That Solomon did make and write, in his most royall daies. Praise him for Azaph and the rest, whom Dauid set to sing: In presence of the holy Arke, when Solomon was king. Praise him for all the songs and play, left vs by learned men, Who by their studies night and day, did much with inke and pen. Praise him for those that loue this Art, and doe the same maintaine: Rewarding it with willing hart, among the godly traine. Praise him and pray that all abuse, thereof may hated be: And that the godly and right vse, may rest in each degree, Praise him and pray that those of skill, may liue in Har-mo-ny: And bring up youth with fauour still: this art to dignifie. Praise him and pray for our good King, his Nobles and the rest: Our Queene the Prince and the off-spring, Lord let them all be blest. Praise him, yea euer sing him praise, on earth most ioyfully: That after death our soules may sing, his praise eternally. Amen. Certaine graces before and after meat, in english meeter very breife &amp; short for children to vse. Grace before meat for poore and rich, made vpon the 4. Petition of the Lords Prayer, and made to the three persons in Trinitie. 1 Ovr Father through Christ giue vs, this day our dayly bread: 2O Christ feed vs by faith in thee, to liue when we are dead. 3Thou Spirit of truth teach vs to pray, with inward sighes and grones: That both the Father and the Sonne, may heare our plaints and mones. O holy and blessed Trinitie, one God in persons three: Peserue thy church our king &amp; realme, and let vs come to thee. Amen. Grace after meat for the rich and wealthie of of the world.

Thy Church, our King, &amp; Queene Lord saue, the Prince and all the friends we haue. Amen. Grace before meate. Thou Lord that didst create all things, for mankind to enioy: And didst ordaine man for thy selfe, to serue thee night and day. O blesse these meates and drinkes of ours, that we thy name may please: With earthly, giue vs heauenly food, both now and all our dayes. Continue all thy goodnesse Lord, and still preserue our King: The Queene &amp; Prince, and these our realmes, aboue all earthly things. Amen. Grace after meate, for poore people. On Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, depend we euermore: God sanctifie our state to vs, and still increase our store. O teach vs Lord in time of need, to trust in thee, and pray: That whether we abound or want, thou Lord maist be our stay. Thy whole and universall Church, Lord Jesus still defend: And to all troubles of the same Lord ever put an end. Amen. A Prayer for the King and State. O Eternall God, most mighty Lord and our heavenly Father in Iesus Christ King of Kings, and Lord of all things, by whom kings of the earth doe raigne and great men doe beare sway both in Church and common weale. O Lord our God we beseech thee in the highest degree, unto our dread Soveraigne Lord King Charles, to his honorable counsell, to his Clergie, Nobilitie, Gentry, Magistrates &amp; commonaltie, to the two universities, to the professors of both lawes to every man in his honest, iust, &amp; lawful calling, that they and every one of them may doe their duty as carefully, godly, honestly conscionably, and in thy feare (O Lord) as they will answer it to thee in the great day of account , and that there be no ecay of any good thing among us, no leading into captivity, nor no complaining in our streets. Amen. Finis</field>
