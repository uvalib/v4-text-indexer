      <field name="fulltext">HIS MAJESTY'S SECOND LIEUTENANTS I This for the Cheerio Optimists, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants; With the milk on their mouths and the time on their wrists, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants: âAbout as wise as the unlick'd cubâ Was written in heaven of the average Sub, But they all belonged to the Suicide Club, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants. II The Colonel's grief and the Sergeant's curse, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants; The Regiments took 'em for better or worse, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants; A sort of medicine for the soulâ Yet pledge 'em deep in the loving-bowl, For they spread the honour thick on the roll, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants. III Lords of the enduring, triumphing line, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants; Nearest, forever, to the Rhine, His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants; Children who fathered veteran hosts In flame-rack'd fields and blood-soak'd posts, And so gave up their proud young ghostsâ His Majesty's Second-Lieutenants! INTERCESSION Made in Thine image, quickened of Thy breath, Who givest us life and givest us, also, death; By Spear and Sponge and Thorn and Bitter Tree, O, Judge and Comforter, we call on Thee. Sick broods the sun with agony of Thy wars, Aghast Thy moon, weary Thine ageing stars. Behold the garden which Thou saw'st âwas goodâ Is but a charnel and a place of blood! Broken the golden bowl and all unloosed The silver girdle. Friendly doors we used Are shut and darkened. On the aching street The mourners go, and only mourners meet. There is no man hath joy of mart or grove, There is no woman hath not lost a love, There is no stripling bears not in his eyes The anguish of the fore-doomed sacrifice. Our sins were scarlet, stubborn was our pride, And yet . . . the Smitten Cheek, the Wounded Side! Avails it not that from yon vineyards rise The crosses of ten thousand Calvaries? These were Thy faithful servants, Lord, no less, Who lay down humbly in their loveliness, Thine is the Kingdom that they cherished thus: If Thou rememberest them, remember us. So that Thy will be done upon this earth Welcome be woe and travail and tears and dearth, Grant us the strength of conquerors. We stand Submissive in the hollow of Thy hand. THE SILENCE Amid the turmoil And the rush, A golden pause, A silver hush! A quietness Which uttereth Speech down the vasty Lines of death; Which saith to them Who lie so still By foreign flood And alien hill: âDear are your names And sweet to hear, Because this land To you was dear: âThis fair, fair landâ Unravished ground, Because your love Folded it round! âAnd these our children Blest and freeâ Becaues of your Gethsemane!â Oh Graciousness That kept the trust, Oh lovers In the dreaming dust, Thus shall our love For you be proved: We keep and love What you so loved. âMUDDY BOOTSâ Muddy Boots! Muddy Boots! Charing Cross for Muddy Boots; Six days' leave they've given himâ He went out most gay and trim,â Comes back threadbare, soiled and grim, A picture for the clean recruits, But very glorious,âMuddy Boots! Muddy Boots! Muddy Boots! London town for Muddy Boots, After week on week on week Of trench and stench and rain and reek And ghastly games at âHide-and-seekâ And âAll-fall-down!â among the brutes; (Seen 'em close, has Muddy Boots!) Muddy Boots! Muddy Boots! âFeeling strangeâ is Muddy Boots, And nervous of the folks he meets; For babes salute him in the streets, And ladies offer him their seats On crowded tubes and L.G. routes, Blushes up, does Muddy Boots! Muddy Boots; Muddy Boots! Dream's come true for Muddy Boots, You can read it in his eyes, HOME, the soldier's paradise! More to be envied than the wise And happier than the sound of flutes, Aren't you, Mister Muddy Boots? LET US FORGET Written when it was proposed that the lower ratings of the Navy should refrain from wearing decorations. God of our fathers, known of old, God of all ships and all the seas Under whose grace we still unfold The Flag of Glory to the breezeâ Lord Nelson's God, be with us yet, Let us forgetâlet us forget! We were poor sailormen, oh Lord, Who went down to Thy vasty deeps To keep the faith and pass the word Against the foulest thing that creeps: Lord God of goodness hear us yet, Let us forgetâlet us forget! Lo, any little child can tell, How in the ânightâ we chanced our necks Mid mines for blowing us to hell, And steel that raked the shuddering decksâ Judge of the faithful, hearken yet, Let us forgetâlet us forget! We sought no honours and no balm, On O.B.E.s we were not hot, A bit of something for the arm Was all we asked and all we got, Lord of the Honest Sleeve, oh yet Let us forgetâlet us forget! For now the Captains and the Kings Have served us to the last old tide, They hint that âsilver gongsâ and things, Merely conduce to beastly pride! Lord God of Decency don't fret, We must forgetâwe must forget! The âLionâ has been sold for junk, âBoy Cornwell'sâ tablet goes for scrap, I wonder are we mad or drunk? Oh, Mister Admiralty chap The King's âSure Shieldâ were we, and yet, Let us forgetâlet us forget! âWE WERE TOGETHERâ In Flanders' fields and London town, In London town and Flanders' fields, A graciousness went up and down. On English thorpe and folded grange And all the misty fields of France There fell a sweetness passing strange. And on the Shrine the Lily glows, In loveliness for loveliness, Beside the Poppy and the Rose. The call is blown, the âfarewellâ said, The silence of the Host descends: We have been present with our dead. NEWSPAPER ENQUIRY The dust complains, The worm must cry âCan we forgive The Deity?â And yet the Grace By which we live, Doth not forget Who can't forgive. SUNSET Sickle moon and smouldering star, Beauty burning in the west; Where is he that I loved best? Beauty burning in the West, Lo, an iron ache called War Gathers him to her stark breast. Sickle moon and smouldering starâ All the soul hath she possess'd Of the love that I loved best. Like a king he takes his rest, Past all loves and dreams that areâ Sickle moon and smouldering star Beauty burning in the West. PEACE They hid the bare bones of the land With banners bright and streamers gay, They took her by the lily hand, And set her in the public way. They deck'd her like a royal bride, With chaplets and with many crowns, They praised her on the country side, And pledged her in the singing towns. Yet some whose look was drawn and white, Whimper'd from out their private pain, âWe heard her crying in the night For them that may not come again!â Oh, foolish souls, if tears she shed, So saddened in her glistering state; She thought not of the happy dead, But of the traitor in the gate. âCARLTONâ âSeveral trains of wounded from the Battle of Loos arrived in London last night. . . . An officer with his arm bandaged, and limping on an umbrella, was met by a lady in evening dress. She arrived in a private motor, and the one word, âCarltonâ was all that passed between him and the chauffeur.ââDaily News. Returning from the Battle of Loos, According to the Daily Noos, With Flanders on my socks and shoes, I spake the one word âCarlton!â We came up by the boat express, My wife was there in evening dress; She'd brought the carâoh, yes; oh, yes! I said the one word, âCarlton!â I did not say, âHello, my dear, How are the chicks?â Not meâno fear: I took the chauffeur by the ear, And rapped out one word, âCarlton!â I did not say, âRejoice, rejoice, Here's Perkins on the old Rolls-Royceââ Without a tremor in my voice I said the one word, âCarlton!â Although my arm was in a sling (They got me by the liver-wing) And my foot ached like anything, I said the one word, âCarlton!â Though I was crumpled by the blast And had been worried and harass'd Upon my honour, all that passed Was just the one word, âCarlton!â Oh, gentlemen, 'twixt you and me, After the trenchesâand the seaâ This is the crown of victory To speak the one word, âCarlton!â By the âold girlâ to take your stand, With the old brolly in your hand, And say in tones that beat the band The haughty one word, âCarlton!â THE MAYFLOWER [1620-1920] Serene, august, through time she watches Her deeps alight with dawns and stars, The sea in every breath she catches, And all her front a blaze of scars. Crowned with the passion and desire That builds and reigns and builds again, She makes her women out of fire And on the waters casts her men. An hundred strong, but quick with power Unto the âWestern wildsâ they came, And landing from the worn âMayflowerâ Called them New England in her name. And when the East ran red with slaughters And Europe shook to felon guns, The Pilgrim Mothers' pilgrim daughters Sent us the Pilgrim Fathers' sons. Shall it be said we ever truckled To them that babble of âold scoresâ? Upon her bosom ye were suckled, And the blood in her heart is yours. THE CORONATION OF HIS MAJESTY GEORGE V I hear the English bugles Shout on the happy breeze, To take a thousand peoples A thousand messages, While the great dawns are waking Across the English seas. O bugles of old England Which through the world do goâ You are the bravest bugles That man will ever blow. You have the fairest music That men will ever know. We crown a King in London Of all the sea-kings bred: The fearful words are spoken, The precious balm is shed; The burden and the glory Are laid upon his head. And he is crowned in Delhi, And where the Orange flows, And in the Southern Islands, And mid the Northern snows, With one who sits beside him White as the Yorkshire rose. O bugles say your proudest With the sweet morning soundâ Unto the English peoples An English King is crowned; And may the strength which sleeps not For ever, gird him round. THE KING'S FIRST GRANDSON At Chesterfield House, at Chesterfield House, The Queen stayed for luncheon and sent for her Spouse, Andbeforethey came outâbetween you and meâ We knew very well what the business might be. At Chesterfield House, at Chesterfield House, The doctor crept in as still as a mouse, And when he came out we learnt to our joy That he'd left with the Princess a fine little boy. A fine little boy, a real Yorkshire lad, The pride of his mother and heir to his dad; He's got a white cot and a coral and bells, And the public will know him as Gerald Lascelles. Let the âFlea and the Fly and the Flitchâ now rejoice, The youth weighs eight pounds and possesses a voiceâ Fill me feyther's old mug with a drop of XX, And here's to the grandson of George the Fifth, Rex! THE HEATHER AND THE ROSE The Duke of York proposed three times.â Morning Paper. He asked the lady in the dance, She wouldna' wed for a' that; He whispered to her at the stance, She shook her head for a' that: For a' that and a' that, The King's braw son and a' that, Earl's dochters are not lightly wonâ Strathmore, Kinghorne and a' that. For a' that and a' that, He sware unto his lucky star: âI'll hae her yet, whate'er befaâ,â And rode a ride like Lochinvar: Hech, sirs, the third time paid for a', And she said: âYesâ and a' that For a' that and a' that, Ye ken the rest and a' that, âThe rank is but the guinea stamp,â And true love's love for a' that. Oh, fetch me up a pint of wine And reach me down my silver tassie, The Heather with the Rose entwine: ââHere's tae us!â and âTo me and mine!â And hansel for this Lad and Lassie!â SARAH BERNHARDT Oh triumphing Death, count up thy victories; Lo thou hast vanquished many souls of flame, And levelled to a ruin and a name Queens that were fair and kings of great emprise, And sealed with dust full many a lover's eyes, And humbled many furious ones who came Unto thy call as tamely as the tame And, meekly, with the innocent and the wise. Now lies she low that had the front of heaven And spake like singing stars. Thy marble kiss Annuls the lips and stills the heart of her And takes the wild white spirit in a snare: So unto thee at last is empiry given; Conqueror indeed art thou that conquerest this! AVE ATQUE VALE Mr Lloyd George has resigned. A great sigh of relief will go up from England as a wholeâ and will be re-echoed throughout Europe. âMorning comment. O comfortable sight! The danger past, The body salved of the unthinkable fate, The foeman carrion by the battered gate, The terrors scattered, the dull anguish cast And Glory floating sweetly at the mast: This who was prop and pillar of your State Passes as one that hath outlived his dateâ And easy comes the English breath at last! Time will be served and benefits forgot; And yet mayhap in yonder land of vines Where sleepers sleep whose memory fadeth not, Another sigh will stir the kingly lines And Valiance whisper from his clayey cot: âDid ye hear that, Billâour old pal resigns?â EDITH CAVELL May 15th, 1918 Behold, to-day, our daughter cometh home, Borne like a dead Queen in a warrior ship, With her hands folded on her English heart Which they might stillâbut could not teach to shake. Holy and humble, faithful, piteous, Unto thy bosom so returneth she; And thou art richer, England, for her dust, Who yet was meek though proud among the proud. ADMIRAL LORD FISHER âSleep soundly in your beds,â and sound we slept, âHit hard, hit everywhere,â and we hit hard; While his steel citadels around us kept Vigil and ward. Behold he sleeps the sleep that men must sleep, Hard hit as mortal men must be hard hit; And of his passing deep shall speak to deep And ponder it. Forget him not; for he was soul and breath And fist for England; and he faltered not, But âyou-be-damnedâ 'em allâeven Admiral Death Who âsacks the lot!â FOR WARREN GAMALIEL HARDING President Harding died on St. Gamaliel's Eve. Gamaliel; Of whom 'twas said, âThe glory dies Since he is dead.â Gamaliel: So did they call Thee, after him Who tutored Paul. Behold the startled Peoples grieve Thy passingâ On Gamaliel's eve . . . Beloved Of the great and free, Oh, âman Without an enemyâ: I see thy kneeling Country spread Lilies to grace Thine honour'd bed; And on thy casket For a pall, âOld Glory,â Fairer than them all. . . . And in my secret Heart I view A fold of our âOld Glory,â too. âFORGIVE THEMâ As Michael Collins lay dying by the roadside his last words were âForgive them.â From the roadside as from the Rood Unto a bow'd and desperate land, Unto the stricken multitude A-shudder at the assassin's handâ âForgive them!â For the dumb hate, and the wild fear, And malice raging in the night, And the black curse too deep to hear, And deeds too loathly for the lightâ Forgive them! For widows' tears and orphans' plaints, And good men dead beneath the sodâ And scoundreldom that quotes the Saints, And murder in the name of Godâ Forgive them! SIR HENRY WILSON Sword at your side And ribands on your breast, You fell And there was woe in Heaven, And shame confest In hell. You share with kings And captains gathered hence The crown; While Murder shrieks at large, And Innocence Bows down. THE HOME-COMING November 11th, 1920. With mournful pomp and honouring gun, Now cometh England's unknown son, Who on himself her wounds did take And lay down humbly for her sake. The England of a thousand years, Greatness and glory without peers, And kings and conquerors proud and dim Stretch their receiving arms to him. âUnknownâ yet knownâand trebly blest; For as he moves to his high rest The woman soul that made us stirs, And every mother thinks him hers. NORWICH AND AMERONGEN The ex-Kaiser makes a point of never being late for dinner, and says grace himself. âNewspaper CorrÃ«spondÃ«nt. To-night thy victim taketh up her rest In the safe keeping of her Country's breast Whilst thou, O Murderer and Son of Hell, Respondest briskly to the dinner bell, And having on thy meat a grace invoked, Dinestâunchoked! VIMY RIDGE April, 1917 On Vimy Ridge the war-light glows, New triumph for victorious browsâ So shines our Lady of the Snows, On Vimy Ridge! On Vimy Ridge the German thief Beholds our glory and his griefâ The Lads who wear the Maple-Leaf, On Vimy Ridge! On Vimy Ridge the price they pay; And, spilling riches to the clay, Mark yet another Canada, On Vimy Ridge! THE LITTLE NATION In August nineteen-thirty-seven I chanced across old John Goo-goo: He had the look of one who knew The way to heaven. He'd changed his name from âBull,â he told me, To satisfy âthe reconciled.â âWhen I was Bull, you know,â he smiled, âNothing could hold me!â âWhereas . . but s-sh, it is verboten!â All one may do is work and pray!â And, oh, his cheek was ashen greyâ Grey as Falloten! In well-patched seat and battered bowler He travestied the ancient blood; On either side of him there stood A Man-Controller! Both these I squared(though they were firm'uns), They slunk off to the Duck and Gun; âNow, John,â quoth I,,, who won, who won? We or the Germans!â Quoth he, âAlas, with lethal engines And furious stroke, we smashed their cup, But Lloyd George said âNo tearing up, Yea and no Vengeance!â âThey biffed the Old Ship in the funnel; They slew our sons as wolves slay goats; They sucked the blood out of our throats, Right through the tunnel! âYet, at the finishâwell, we're bidden To think no thoughts of get-your-own-back. We must be thankful Jerry's thrown back Upon his own effluvious midden! âAnd surely 'tis our Christian duty Fust to forgive and pay the piper, As we grow older we grow riper, So here's to Deutschland, home, and beauty! âFor while the righteous sing penillions, And Germans splutter in the chorus, With nought but âstrenuous daysâ before us, We're paying off the blinkin' millions. âOf course it seems a very meek end, To toil and moil sans wage or drinking, But still we keep a Fund called Sinking, And pay in four-pence every week-end. âAnd we have other compensations, Oh, yes we haveâfor once a year We are allowed one pint of beer, And screws of shag as well as rations. âAnd look what I've received from Neath!â [He had a permit in his hand To listen to the annual band That plays sweet hymns on Hampstead Heath.] âOh friend,â I cried, âthe situation Looks bright. Yet nobly have we stoodâ To do the little nations good We are become a little nation!â PEACE HATH HER VICTORIES âA trade war will prolong and embitter afresh hatreds which should be allowed to die.â âLord Bryce at Birmingham. The shades of night were falling fast As through the gloom of London passed A youth who'd borrowed from Lord Bryce A banner with this strange deviceâ âNo Trade War, Please!â His brow was glad: his eye beneath Flashed like a tin-sword from its sheath; And like a four-three trumpet rung The accents of his foolish tongueâ âNo Trade War, Please!â In happy homes he saw the light Of German stoves gleam warm and bright, And to the Sixpenny Bazaar He drove his German motor carâ âNo Trade War, Please!â âO stay!â the maiden said, âand rest Thy addled head upon this breast!â âI only rest my head,â quoth he, âOn blouses made in Germanyâ No Trade War, Please!â âBeware the Prussian's âEnglish Branch,â Beware the dumper's avalanche!â This was the patriot's last good night. The youth replied, âYou're wrongâI'm right!â âNo Trade War, Please!â At break of day as factoryward He plodded to find all gates barred And nothing doing anywhere, A voice cried through the startled air, âNo Trade War, Please!â And later, on the Underground, With empty pockets he was found, Still grasping in his hand of ice The banner of the gay Lord Bryceâ âNo Trade War, Please!â There on the platform cold and grey, Bankrupt but beautiful he lay; They wrapped him in a nice print shroud From Dusseldorf, and sobbed aloud âNo Trade War, Please!â And then they wired to Berlin, âThis is too muchâyou've done him in!ââ A voice fell like a falling star âPeace hath her victoriesâjust like war!â âNo Trade War, Please!â TAILS UP! I What do the English say, my lad? Tails up!âtails up! With hell let loose on a world gone mad, Tails up!âtails up! By the oaths their fathers swore, By the lilies of Agincourt, By Drake and Nelson and fifty more, Tails up!âtails up! II For thrust on thrust and wave on wave, Tails up!âtails up! We are the hammer and the grave, Tails up!âtails up! We, who have seen the soul of things, And bear upon our battling wings The glory and the blaze of kingsâ Tails up!âtails up! III Oh, youth that is age, and love that is strifeâ Tails up!âtails up! Though life be death, and death be life, Tails up!âtails up! Though there be neither end nor ease, And no more joy in breath or breeze, And the Lord forget His promisesâ Tails up!âtails up! NO CHRISTMAS âThe Kaiser has given orders prohibiting any Christmas celebrations in Germany.â âDaily Paper. âOh my!âno Christmas?â Little Fritz Thinks Mutterchen Has lost her wits! By the Kaiser's Orders, child,â No Peace on Earth No mercy mild, No waits, no bells, No fiddling, No glory for The new-born King; No plums, no flour, We mustn't make Der Kuchenâ Otherwise, the cake; No roasting, boiling, Baking, grilling While the All-Highest Does his Killing! No Holy Night For you or me, No stocking full, No sparkling tree; No mirthful parties, No burnt paws, No Christmas And no Santa Claus! Trot off to bed, The hour grows late, And mind you say Your Hymn of Hate! No Christmas! Babe Of Bethlehem! Thou who didst love And âsuffer them!â Thou who forgave us From Thy Tree! This is the final Blasphemy The murderer Of a million sons, Proceeds to rob Thy little ones! . . . No Christmas this year! Thereâdon't cry, And take your knuckle From your eye; Never despair To hope is wiserâ Perhaps, next year There'll be no Kaiser! BLIGHTY Of all the words, this is the wordâ Blighty! By soldier men the most preferredâ Blighty! It lifts them clean beyond the foam And makes them see the lights of home (O, sweeter than the honeycomb), Blighty! To India, I'm told, we owe Blighty! I'd like to bet it's English, though, Blighty! It bucks you on the hardest days, It keeps your feet in virtue's ways (The Colonel breathes it when he prays), Blighty! You think it when you cross the top, Blighty! It nerves you for the butcher's shop, Blighty! O Lord to get 'em hand-to-hand And on the squeal in No-Man's-Land, Learing your home address is âStrand, Blighty!â The chap they pip fair sings for joy, âBlighty!â And surgeon grins, âYou're lucky, boy. Blighty!â The chap that gets the proper pips, Don't sing so loud, but out it slips, The last word on his faithful lips, Blighty! The dream, the vision, the desire, Blighty! (Now there 's a line you can admire, Blighty! And you'd admire it twice as much If you'd received the front-line touch With living in a rabbit hutch), Blighty! If I remain above the grassâ Blighty! I reckon to earn a six days' passâ Blighty! Behold the end of all my woesâ The nipper in his Sunday clothes, The missus blooming like a rose, Blighty! Them that's gone West will also reach Blighty! Leastways, that's what the padres teach Blightyâ And when they're through the jasper door, And safe upon the shining floor, They'll whisper, marvelling, âWhy, sureâ It's Blighty!â FROM A POINT OF VANTAGE Bowers of bunting, bands and t' crowd, Shoutingâglad and very proud. We've done wi' murder and blood and dinâ I reckon I know'd which side would win! Ay! that's Nelsonâwell content, Wi' flags all up his monument, Only one arm an' his eye in a patchâ Same as he was last Cup Tie Match! See them âpylonsâ shine in the sun, Names of battles on every one; And there's a angelâshe that brings Peace and healing on her wings. Now they're coming! Yon's Foch! Hooray!!! An' Haig! an' Beatty, gay as gay! An' glittering âAlliesâ row on rowâ I reckon t'owd Kaiser should see us now! An' here's the lads our Joe was with . . . Lord love 'em! . . they seem like kin and kith: That's right, motherâlean on meâ I reckon we know where our lad be! THE LAST AIR RAID The wine was good, the dinner not amiss And through the window one beheld the moon, Flattering the river like a silver tuneâ Frigid and fair, and wise in her own bliss As when she took Endymion with a kiss: âWaiter! Twice now I've asked you for a spoon, And bring theâcrikey! that was a maroon!â âHimmel!âund vistles!â gasps the cringing âSviss.â So to one's flat (beneath five concrete floors), Composure, resignation, fortitude, And thoughts removed from earthliness and selfâ âCough, cough,â âbark, bark,â âcrump, crumpââand then a thud: The glasses rattle, something shakes the doors, And Nelson dithers on the mantelshelf. VISIONS I saw the rivers run a living red, I saw the gardens torn and trampled down, Rape in the field and murder in the town, And little children counting up the dead. I heard the Felon cry:âIll be my good, And Hell my province till the world shall kneel And bare its neck for my omnipotent heel!â I turned to look and saw him chopping wood! On London streets I saw the banners shine And mile on mile of glory walk between Glad miles of prideâa people who had been Fed with dread dews, tasting the perfumed wine. And last night when the moon hung very low And the flags drooped each on its sleepy mast I saw a thousand thousand wraiths that passed Through the dim aisles with solemn steps and slow. In war-stained garments, radiant and fair, Majestical to look upon, with eyes That had known death and searched out paradise They pressed as if on some high business bent: Yea, every Mother's son of them was there, Bands playing and colours flying ghostlywise, And all their music seemed to faint and fail To âTipperaryâ and the âLong, Long Trail!â TROTSKY AND THE BELLS OF DOORN Out of her ancient snows, through travail and tears and blood, Big with the spirit she rose and fashioned her empery; Fought and wrought till she stood diademedâgrasping in fee Fat land and forest and flood from arctic to summer sea. Jewelled the gold of her cup; golden the wine she poured Forth for her princes to sup; golden the grain she storedâ Merchant unto the world, withal that the world might be fed; Keeping the wheatless in sheavesâand keeping the fearless in dread: Ah, mighty and awesome and proud, inviolable, august Goest thou now in thy shroud; stretchest thou now in the dust? Hark to the merry bells, the wedding bells of Doorn, Hearken all ye that suffer, hearken all ye that mourn: When this Death's head, this Boast, this fouler of God's air, This shame of the Holy Ghost, this Devil's close despair; This scarletest, for whom the hangman ever tarried; (Yet must we wash him lamb-white because he's getting married) Rattled the chains he had forged to fetter all mankindâ Who took the eastern field to abate the western wind? Who was our âfriend in needâ? Who was our âdear ally Bound to us with hoops of love and bound indissolublyâ? Ring out, oh bells, ring out, reach if you can afar Into that filthy basement where the Tsar And âthose who were with himâ perished at the hand Of one who hath great honour in the land And since his boots with innocent blood were wet Has been promoted by the Soviet From the inspectorship of Imperial durance To a Chief Inspectorship of Life Assurance! Nathless let's not repine, also begone dull care, The lucky are as pleased, perhaps pleaseder than ever they were, Next week, good lack, we hold a celebration By what's remaining of the Russian nation Of the fifth anniversary or birthday Of Russia's âDawn of libertyâ or dearthday. Those who have not been killed will please attend, And each of you may bring a lady friend; Trotsky will lecture on the recent troubles Price of admission fifteen million roubles. He's billed to tell us that there is no God And to âremindâ usâwhich seems rather oddâ That though we have had five years of revolution And âall for allâ (including destitution), There's âmore to come,â and we must tread in sorrow The bright Red Road unto that glad to-morrow When men will be âcontemptuous of pityâ And make the world into a holy city For murderers, thieves, free lovers, atheists, And people who are handy with their fistsâ Providing they have knives to hold within 'em And loads of bourgeoisie and leave to skin 'em. . . So are we called by Tyranny's reveille, And Russia crawling on her empty belly Listens and wonders if the skies are brazen And the heavens brass. . . . SIGNS OF THE TIMES âTis wonderful to read how âWeâ (Winston that is) destroyed Von Spee. âWeâ gave the Admirals âa prog,â âWeâ set the dates and kept the log; âWeâ spiked the telegram consoling Which said that Sturdee's Fleet was âcoalingâ; âWeâ felt âa shiver up our spine,â But what of that? At half-past nine The âsombre Oliverâ blew in And murmured, with a sort of grin; âSir, you'll be pleased to hear you've got 'em, The German ships are at the bottem!â WHAT WILL YOU SMASH? After witnessing the ceremonies attaching to the assembly of the new Parliament, a Labour member called out from the gallery of the House of Lords, âWe will smash all this.â The smasher who would not be rash Should first find out what he would smash; Lest by some treasonable trick, He finds inside the thatâa brick. âAll this,â for you to smash, good sir, Is England. Have a look at her. Behold her aspect, meek and wise, Behold her comfortable eyes. Behold the splendours of her Throne Built in the seas she calls her own; Behold her wealth of mart and street. Behold the Empires at her feet. Behold her sinew and her thew, Behold her sons, blade straight, steel true; And on the winds of glory blown The banners of her old renown. The last man who would âsmash all thisâ Has lodging now at Doorn, I wis. He counts his ruined hopes in shucks, And spends his leisure keeping ducks. Be not puffed up; Go easy, Bill, The hand that reared you, rules you still; And ere you risk the unfilial bash Consider wellâWhat will you smash? NO ANSWER Why do women dress?âHigh Court Judge. When Eve went out a-walking She wore a bunch of leaves, And set the neighbours talking About her lack of sleeves. She mentioned it to Adam, Who growled in his distress: âOh, kindly tell me, madam, Why, why do women dress? âThis little bill marked âpaidâ is For leaves enough for ten, D'ye dress to vex the ladies, Or just to please the men?â And though through countless ages The knotty point involved Has been discussed by sages, The problem's still unsolved. TWENTY-EIGHT SHILLINGS A WEEK With fingers weary and worn, 'Mid frillies and ha-ha's red, A woman stands in unwomanly rags Wishing that she were dead, Scrub! scrub! scrub! A-getting rid of the dirt And giving them all an extra rub She sings the âSong of the Shirt!â Scrub, scrub, scrub! While Ramsay crows aloof! And scrubâscrubâscrub, While Webb gets on the roof, It's oh to be a slave, Along with the beautiful Turk, Where women have never a soul to save, If this is Christian work! Scrub! scrub! scrub! Till the brain begins to swim; Scrubâscrubâscrub, Till the eyes are heavy and dim, Smocks for the ladies fine, Shirts for the gentlemen sleek, And for myself and the little 'ome Twenty-eight bob a week. O men with Sisters dear! O men with Mothers and Wives! Is it immaculate linen you wear, Or human creatures' lives? Scrubâscrubâscrub, Picking up money like dirt From Ma's terumpity-umpity-ums, And father's clean-boiled shirt! THE PAUNCH I dreamed a dream of thundering guns, And true blue Britons and their sons, The sons were lean, but what of that?â The fathers were extremely fat. The sonsâin helpings past belief Got B.E.F.âthe fathers Beef. The sons for battle shamed the glutton The fathers hogged along on mutton And counting up their honoured dead Solaced themselves with âToo much bread.â This was their motto, peradventure, Youth for the trenchâage for the trencher. ALL SING Let others tell of deeds of blood On grim and ghastly fieldsâ We'll keep our hearts up as we should On what the business yields! Let others sweep the war sick sky The U-boat-haunted mainâ We'll buy and sell and sell and buy And buy and sell again! Let others wear the hero's crownâ The worthy and the willingâ We'll do the hero's missus down For sixpence in the shilling! HIC JACET Stranger, whoever you may be Pause, please, and shed a tear, The 'umble British Citizen 'Umbly reposes here. Oh let a bit of London pride Above his head be grown, He fought for all men's liberty And quite forgot his own. SIC TRANSIT I âTuck me up in my little gold bed With all my golden gear to warm me: For many a year I'm sure to be dead, No matter how much you embalm me!â That is what Tutankhamen said As he dropped on the pillow his poor old head, And sighed the last sigh in his palaced pile Beside the purple river Nile. II For a thousand years he slept and slept And never smiled and never wept. Another score of centuries passed And found him sleeping like the last. III But on Friday noon to his secret door Came Lord Carnarvon and two or three more. And all of them said, âScat, scat, scatâ To Pharaoh Tutankhamen's cat. IV And soon this King will find his place With other âmummiesâ in a nice glass case, And little children will stare at him And say, with a certain amount of vim, âTu Tu, Oh we remember you!â V Thus passes all human gloryâ And that's the end of the story. REQUIEM For him who said to Death: âWhere is thy sting?â And laughed to the grave: âWhere is thy victory?â Counting his share of the world a trivial thing. So he might frustrate the world's enemyâ What branch of woeful cypress shall we bring, What song of lamentation shall we sing, With what sad music move a heavy string? Lo in his broken splendour he hath rest Sweet as the rest of sainthood; and he sleeps The sleep of the beloved. To his breast Nothing may come of hurt or harm or doubt. Upon his soldier-pillow prone he lies, England still shining in his sightless eyes, Even as through the terrors in which he strove, And in his heart of dust the undying love Even as at the hour that he was spent. From us he needs nor comfort nor content: Yet deck the Stone and hang the banners out And offer up the silent sacrifice: He will be very close to us to-day For good men's souls yearn to his valorous clay, And women's prayers encompass him about. FROM THE WATCH TOWER No victor shout, no sound of bell! Yetâour hearts tell us all is well, And beat beneath the wounds of Fate, Measured and stately and elate. As every day a dawn upsprings With Eden on his kindling wings, And every night a punctual hand Falls like a blessing on the land; So, unto quick and unto wraith, And answering them of little faith, And crowning them that did endure Are these, Thy promises, made sure. THE SONS OF SARAH The Sons of Sarah seldom bother, they have inherited tricks by the peck; For the Sons of Sarah favour their mother, who played it off on Abimelech. And, because they are sons of an elderly lady who found favour in Abraham's eyes When he was an hundred, the Sons of Sarah are old men's sons and extremely wise. It is their care in all the ages to collar the profits, to scheme and enmesh, It is their care that the man who engages to pay must pay in cash or flesh; It is their care that the courts âjudge fairly,â it is their care to sue and distrain, To swap and sell and promote, and duly to swap and sell and promote again. They say to the merchants âThat is ours, hand over,â they say to the minor âThix hundred per thent,â They say to the widow, âMy dear, bring us cover,â and they suck and suck till the blood be spent. So they may guzzle and ramp and fatten and limp from Poland into Mayfair, And pat their stomachs and leer and batten and pile up more shekels everywhere. To these from birth is Honour forbidden, from these till death is Mercy afar, They are concerned with matters hidden, beneath the ledgers their altars are; They build no ladder from earth to heaven, they bear no witness to any creed, In brief, they are simply simple Hebrews and keen on their simple passionâGREED. Oh, the Sons of Sarah grow and are blessed; they know the âangelsâ are on their side, They know that in them is the grace confessÃ¨d, and for them are the mercies multiplied; They trade at the Feet, they quote the Word, they can tell you how truly the promise runs; They have cast their burden upon the Lord, and the Lord just gives things to Sarah's Sons. THE WHITE FEATHER LEGION There's a legion that's never been 'listed, That follows no colour or crest, But split into silly detachments Loafs round in the bars of the West; Our fathers have given us the blessings They taught us and groomed us and crammed, We all part our hair in the middle, But we mustn't go out and be damned (Dear boys), We mustn't get shot and be damned. So some of us cherish the flapper, And some of us run the cocotte, And none of us wants to be âwounded,â Or âmissing,â or that sort of rot; And some of us dawdle at Brighton, And some of us shirk at Southend, And some of us ârestâ up the river, In charge of a giddy young friend (Of course), Thank God for the giddy young friend. We've painted the night clubs vermilion, We're hot at the âPalaceâ and âPav,â We're just a bit short of the ready, But by thunder we spend what we have; We laugh at the world as we find it, Its women and crooks and âbad men,â And no one can make us downhearted, For things'll soon straighten again (Dear boys), They'll straighten and buck up again. Big meals and fresh air are our portion, The âniggersâ and piers are our share, When cruisers loom grim in the offing, Both we and our glasses are there; Yes, somehow and somewhere and always We're first when the shoutings begin, We put up a howl for Old England, The Kaiser can hear in Berlin (Dear boys), He hears it and quakes in Berlin. We prance at the head of the Armyâ That is, when it walks through the street; We wave little flags at the station And drink with whoever we meet; We know that the row will soon finish And rifles be back on the shelves, Then won't we be proud of our country And shake the glad hand with ourselves (Good men) Who is there so good as ourselves! Then a health (we must drink it in whispers) To the flats on the field and the foam, And also to us, the pacific Young Gentlemen Slackers at home; Yes, a health to ourselves ere we scatter In taxis to get the last train, Cheer oh! for the White Feather Legion, Goes back to its females again. Regards! Goes back to its slippers again, Hurrah! The Bass and the lager again, Here's how! The gin and dry ginger again, Salue! The cigar and the night-cap again. ANDREW BONAR LAW Let him sleep well, whom laughter had passed by, And glory moved to no more than a sigh; Who âfought the fightâ with brooding, sorrowful eyes; Whose only pomps were in his obsequies; Who, for this England, trod grim ways to death, Careless of all, except he kept the faithâ Who loved her with âthe love that casts out fear.â And made the proudest proud to touch his bier. [For each the immitigable thrust!] For each the immitigable thrust! Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Yet Goodness and the soul of her Have power to cheat the sepulchre; And men may die their deaths, and then Live in the reverence of men. So livest thou! . . . Thrice happy he Who gains this immortality! THE UNKNOWN Thou art the oaths they swore, Thou art the sword they tried, Thou art the pangs they bore, Thou art the deaths they died! Thou whom the Colonel loved, Thou whom the Sergeant cursed, Thou whom the next man shovedâ Comest thou so enhearsed!â With Kings to walk behind And Queens to weep for thee, And all the âlong trailâ lined With England's majesty. Hail! oh thou conqueror And thou thrice blessÃ¨d one! Thou triumpher over war, Thou every mother's son! SPEED A Mr. Brown of Twickenham Possessed a motor-car, In which, accompanied by his spouse, He drove both near and far. Now Mr. Brown, through lack of means, No chauffeur might employ, And did his cleaning overnight Assisted by a boy. The boyâand thereby hangs our taleâ Was an un-Christian child, Who hid a something wicked heart Beneath an aspect mild; And, inasmuch as Brown one day Reproved him with an oath, He sware that he would be revenged On Brown and partner both. For this revenge he watched and watched, With no uncertain watchâ I grieve to say his temperament Was eminently Scotch. Although the wicked oft must wait The righteous to annoy, They seldom have to wait in vainâ 'Twas so with this bad boy. Eftsoons he overheard Brown say To Mrs. Brown, âTake heed, The one big thing in motor-cars Is speed, my duckie, speed!â âSpeed,â mused our gentle youth, âSpeed, speed, Gadzooks, but here's my chance!â And then he turned him on his heel With fiendish countenance. âI'll give 'em speed!â he said. âBy George They shall have speed enow, They shall have speed to take 'em toâ Well, wellâlet's say below.â So down the street he hied in haste Into a chemist's store, And purchased there of chemicals, A shillingsworth or more. From which he did compound and mix, With fierce and cunning skill, A high progressive that should make The fast go faster still; The recipe I cannot give (For which my stars I thank), But the lad put th' accursed stuff Into Brown's petrol tank. That afternoon, at three o'clock, The Browns went forth in style, Brown wore his very wooliest coat, His wife her usual smile. The engine coughed and churned and raced, Then leapt into its strideâ âMy love,â said Mrs. Brown, âI think The brake should be applied.â Ah, me, and well-a-day! the brake! The power of brakes was past; For every turn the crank-shaft made Was swifter than the last. In fine the thing was really off, It shrieked and buzzed and glode, Full fifty constables went down Before it on the road. A drunken man who saw it pass Cried, âMay I take the pledge If that there car ain't driven by The Devil or S. F. Edge.â Two lovers seated in a seat Shivered as it drew near, Said one to t'other, âD'ye think It lightened then, my dear?â Unto the wheel Brown grimly stuck, He scorned to leave the ship; While Mrs. Brown squoze furiously The bulb that says, âPip, Pip!â At length they clomb a workhouse wall, And o'er the chimneys flew, And sailed miraculously up The vast and sky-ey blue. The startled public rubbed its eyes, And in âThe Newsâ that night, It read, âA Motor Disappears Into the Ewigkeit.â And still through space they whizz and whirr, With speed that naught may stem; Comets complain, and little stars, Of being bumped by them . . . . So will they whizz, so will they whirr, Until, when Fate is kind, They get up speed enough to run Into themselves behind. ROBERT Upon a road in [Ha-ha], Which was not over wide, A certain fat policeman Did stride and stride, and stride. He was a proper fellow, His jowl was turkey-red, A somewhat jaunty helmet Reposed upon his head. A chaste, embroidered armlet, Upon his sleeve he bore; He had a blue, blue tunic, Which buttoned down before. He kept his buttons burnished As bright as bright as bright; The gloves upon his fisties Were radiantly white. His boots of hard black leatherâ The honest fellow's prideâ Aroused to love and worship The cobbling country-side: They were so big and bulky, So large and round of girth, They made such obvious bulges Upon the convex earth. They seem to have been fashioned To suit a certain rhyme About the use of footprints Upon the sands of time. And sooth to say they fitted Ridiculously well The precious little tootsies Or this same constable. But shining boots and buttons, And coats of heavenly blue, Though pleasant of a morning Unto the tax-payers' view, Are not the only housings And meet accoutrement Of County Council Roberts Who are on business bent. Oh, no! oh, no! oh nono! Oh, nono, nono, no! Your constable bears weapons When hunting he doth go. Of old he carried truncheons, And gyves for people's wrists, A lantern and a whistle To frighten anarchists. But in this day of marvels, The County Council men Have given him new fixings, The names of them being ten, So that without a handbag, To keep them out of sight, The constable of [Ha-ha] Is an unhappy wight: For they include a compass, A tape-measure, a map, A piece of india-rubber, A box of pills, a cap; A dog-chain and a penknife, Some gum, andâon my soul!â A real gas-meter stop-watch Jewelled in every hole. Thus you will see, dear reader, That Robert the sublime Is now engaged to cope with A special class of crime. No longer he pursueth Breakers of bolts and bars, But only wicked people Who ride on motor cars. The Robert of my story Haunts the sweet [Ha-ha] lanes; His tape-measure is short of ends, His stop-watch never gains. But loses, loses, loses, Throughout the livelong day; Henceâon the mathemeticsâ The motorist has to pay. For twenty miles an hour, Timed by our friend the slow, Is many miles an hour, Quicker than one should go. Oh, licence-holders, hear me! Beware of this fat man; When e'er you go through [Ha-ha] He'll have you if he can. Before the âbeaksâ he'll hale you, Though you say âSir!â and âZounds!â And, on the mathematics, They'll fine you twenty pounds. TRADE Sir Hugh de Broklehurst, That Knight so bold, Dropped fairish moneys, In mines of gold. Sir Hugh de Broklehurst, Gave to the Jews Small bits of paper Called I.O.U.s. Sir Hugh de Broklehurst, Being down of revenue, Cut down the famous, old Encestral evenue. Lady de Broklehurst Said to her maid, âIf he goes on like this I shall try trade.â Lady de Broklehurst Popped up to town In a new Paris hat And a smart gown. Blessed with activities Nothing could stop Lady de Broklehurst Opened a shop. Where you might buy yourself Fruit, cake and tea, And pay at the desk, please, To Lady de B. Thanks to her aptitudes, And to her smile, Lady de Broklehurst Soon made a pile. All the smart people With coachmen and grooms Come to take tea in her Cosy back rooms. . . . One day Sir Hugh de B. Chancing to pass, Saw his wife serving out Milk in a glass. Sir Hugh de Broklehurst Staggered, and cried, âSurely that isn't my Late blushing bride!â Into the tea-shop Forthwith he strode, Looked at her closely And said he'd be blowed. Lady de Broklehurst Beamed on her spouse; âPlease let me show you All round the house.â Sir Hugh was furious, But when he saw Her ladyship's ledger He smiled, âHaw, haw, haw!â âLend me five hundred,â Quoth he, âthere's a dearâ No, noâon my honour Neither skittlesânor beer. âI've done with all that, love, Believe me. Fact is I'm thinking of starting A quiet little biz.â With wifely admonishment, Not to be rash, Lady de Broklehurst Weighed out the cash. Sir Hugh de Broklehurst Blessing his stars, Took up an agency For certain cars. From morning till evening He raked in the pelf, And began very shortly To build for himself. The Broklehurst motorsâ At all the big shows You see them marked purchased In glittering rows. And when certain persons Behold them, pardie, They think of a bun-shop And Lady de B. And they smile in their beards: âFor her ladyship's sake We mustn't remark that These cars take the cake.â Sir Hugh de Broklehurst, That Knight so bold Has now whips of money In silver and gold. Sir Hugh de Broklehurst Has bought from the Jews All his old paper And I.O.U.s. Sir Hugh de Broklehurst, Being full of revenue, Is planting a famous, new Encestral evenue. AT THE OLD BAILEY To A. D. Lord Alfred Douglas was a disagreeable witness.ââ The Common Serjeant. We spoke the truth and bared their shame, and so They bring the gag, the thumbscrews, and the knout, And hired mouths to spit their venom out, And marshal all their bullies in a row; Whereatâmark well their sick chagrinâwe go To give them thump for thump and shout for shout, And shake the bowel of their leading lout Who would have killed our honours for a show. Chiefly to you this victory, by God's grace, Most âdisagreeable witnessâ with the thrust That withers liars in their obscene placeâ The honour in which kings have put their trust, The name was a name at Chevy Chase, Shine on, serene above the smirch and dust. FOR JOSEPH CONRAD Why do we go down to the sea in ships, And fight the tempest and the hurricane, And take delight in elemental pain, And all the bitter brine upon our lips, And all the winds that harry us like whips, And voyage after voyage made in vain? What is our hope, where is our ultimate gain, That we unleash ourselves in such dire grips? Was it for love of toil and trafficking That this man perished like a tired king, Still with his galleons? At the wheel he went Through the last storm conning the age-old markâ Far off he saw the islands of content, And beauty sleeping somewhere in the dark. HALF A BRICK Lord of the nether and more noisome hells, For whom long Chris weeps in his handkerchief, And damp Forgiveness whimpers from the brief Of him who so defieth German shells; Thou whose bright works the pushful newsman sells To furnish money for âThe Children'sâ neif O, leprous Partner of the Impenitent Thief, Come forth and view thy rank âimpossibles.â Gilded and scented, each in his clean shirt, They mop and mow and giggle and squeal and bawl, And from thy altars eat the ancient dirt And sup the skimmings of the obscene pits; Drunk at thy stercoraceous feet they sprawl, Who gavest them thy sores and not thy wits. Mr. ASQUITH WEPT [SOME YEARS AGO] Rare and refreshing fruit. Oh, ruddy and rare, And odorous! Behold, the Tree of Cant And vain Imaginings which we did plant That it might spread bright branches on the air And drop for each poor man a rich man's share, And yield the lords of sentiment and rant And every charlatan and recusant The proud rewards such arborage should bear. How it did prosper and blossom our tree of trees, Like the old green bay-tree in the Old Script . . . But now by frosts of Doom it hath been nipped, And to our frightened glances it appears Blacker than the funereal cypresses, And we must water it with Front Bench tears. THE MAKEWEIGHT Petrarch thou should'st be living at this hour, Poetry hath need of thee: she is a fen Of dissolute waters; pad and fountain pen At every fireside, in every bower, Have pretty well destroyed our ancient dower Of formal verse. We are metreless, rhymeless men, Oh, raise us up, return to us again, And give us legislation, rubrics, power! A sonnet is a wondrous thing, God wot, Likened by William Sharp to a pint pot; Still, to be done with bauble and gew-gaw, Let us revive and love thy golden law, And for the benefit of them who whine âThe price [viz., half-a-guinea] seems a lot,â Let us chuck in a generous fifteenth line. SHAKESPEARE O royal thou, England's chief ornament, True being of Poesy, best-beloved son Of the High Muses, lordly statured one Out of an hundred which are eminent; Spirit most fair, substance most excellent, Jester and angel, nightingale and swan, Behold what sorry slights are laid upon Thy Fame wherewith the centuries were content. Lo, Durning Lawrence hath an antic care To oust thee from thy starry kingdoms down, Smudge with a cypher figures away thy crown, Caine gives the memory of thy face a jog By the bright disposition of his hair, Correlli is encamped in thy sweet town, And Harris sorts thee nobly with the hog. SYBIL THORNDIKE For you they might have built a faery tower Filled with all shapes of delicate loveliness, Visions that Jove bestows on whom he would bless, Dreams that were dreamed by Helen in her bower, Or fashioned for Danae in the glowing shower, Delight which singeth to the wilderness And takes the golden day like a caress Or slumbers on the midnight like a flower. Yet there shall be no softness in your feigning And only queens of iron could reign your reigning You who have chosen the agony and the smart, The hurt, the travail and the unstanched heart, And worn upon a brow with myrtle fleckt The steely diadem of the intellect. âSONNETâ Upon a hill of guff the Devil sat And round him thronged a very pretty host Of twopenny scorners of the Holy Ghost And pie-faced duds who edit this and that; Each seemed to dress his hair with bacon fat Each on each foolish ankle wore a spat; Each an expert at holding down his post Would vie with t'other who might swank the most Though each was just as frightened as a cat. âIn the first number of âThe Flying Horseââ [And here there was much sprinkling and some hissing] âI find,â the Devil said, âa so-called sonnet; It isn't meat for you and me, of course, But paste it out, Messieurs, and ponder on itâ How many of the lines have gone amissing?â DANCERS The one-armed man flings rag-time to the street Out of a battered cornet, while his pal Vamps on a fierce harmonium; Sue and Sal Two-step and bunny hug and part and meet And meet and part with curtsies most discreet, And whoop like niggers; and the tiniest gal Leads through the outskirts of the festival Her solemn baby brother's toddling feet. Oh, golden head and eyes of trustful blue, Too kind for sadness and too young for tears, Here by the rag-shops of the reeking stew Thou tread'st a measure angels late have trod Unto a music caught from the hid spheres, And dost thy dancing in the sight of God. APOLLO His cheek was wan, His heart was wild, He was thrall to sorrow, And dream beguiledâ The Lord Apollo Had touched the child. The Lord Apollo, In silver state, Hath touched him there, By the black garth gate, As he watcheth Sirius Burning late. On whom this Lord Doth set his seal Shall be deep woe And little weal; For he shall see And he shall feel. He sees the soul That Beauty bares Unto her secret Ministers, And round his brow The thorn he wears. For common men The rose is red And odorous Till she be deadâ To him she sayeth Why she bled; And why she bleeds And mourns all night, And with what queens Of old delight Her sister rangeth, Being white. EAST CAN BE WEST They stood beside the Philharmonic Hall, A tinkly jewelled Venus from Iran And her swart lordâof nigh three cubits span About the midriff. She seemed full of gall And raged it out in Pelhevi, with small Teeth baredâand eyes . . . oh, suffering, suffering man! He blenched beneath what you might term his tan And reeled like one who is about to fall. When he had managed to dispose of her (By cab), I questioned him, saying, âFair Sir, We come like water and like wind we go, But what's the reason of this little row?â âHai, Excellency,â he answered, âyou do tooch Mai heart . . . That Moon!âshe not forgive me, noâ Las' night I had a leetle drop too mooch!â FOR A POET It shall suffice if one swift word Of thine, the living faith hath stirr'd In one sick soul when faith was blurr'd. And if, upon the tilth of pain, Thou rearest one earful of the grain Of Power, that men may sow again To keep the seed of Paradise; Though thou be broken, sere, and thrice Blasted by Fate, it shall suffice. NOTWITHSTANDING These are the chains we clank, These are the gyves we wearâ Still there are gods to thank, Still there is sweet and fair. Unto the breast the thrust, For hands and feet the treeâ Still shall the twisted dust Smile out its agony. Vainly we shake the bars Of death and woe and sinâ And still the morning stars Quire to the cherubin. THE WAGNERITE His hair is long. He smokes a dirty pipe. He hath a beard, a dull eye, and false teeth, A thin top lip to scorn the lip beneath Which droops and bulges and is of the type Known among little girls as âcherry-ripe.â His cheeks and hands are tinged with yellow like death, Or perished lilies in a funeral wreath; His suit is loose and brown, with a green stripe. The hujahs snarl the snarl of the mad dog, The fiddles scream, the tom-toms rip and roar; Says he, âThank God, they're warming up at last!â His tuppenny soul floats out upon the blast Of shameless noise to where the German hog Helped by the German ape, is foul once more. THE LAST SONNET All these bright shapes and visions of delight, This turret of gold, this chair of amethyst Put thou away; the cheek that Judas kiss'd, The body of death worn in the unending fight, One to the worm, the other to the kite. Put thou away the sharp steel and the fist, And let the foolish wanton as they list. Another thief hath entered in the night. So are we served, triumphant and elate. What of the darkened Kingdom then remains That the grooms mark our passing with such state? This is the perfume of our ice-cold veins: We made considerable mirth of fate, And on the stair of Hell we break our chains.</field>
