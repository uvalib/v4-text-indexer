Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Incipit Legenda Sismond Qhylom ther was ane hygh and myghty prince, In Salern tawker Ã¾ei clepyd hys name, Which that honorably gydyd hys province, That through the worlde sprang hys grete fame. Bocase in kent witnesith the same, That he seyth hys cowrte wes off such prowes, All people drugh Ã¾ider to seike honour with nobles. Hys regioune so full was of haboundance, Off wertue, welth, goode rule and prosperite, The people, the lond, wer sette in such gouernance, Thei neuer wndirstoode off none aduersite. Tawker thys noble knyght off dignite So witty was and wyse in all hys demene, That from fylthy vice he kept all hys londe clene. And kept hys people euer wndyr such awe, They neuer dorst rebell ayeynest hys highnes, For treuely he executyd so hys lawe, Iustyfying the treuth by rightwysnes; Euery mater so wele he koude redresse, Discretly retorne the wronge in to right, Both [to] god and to man he was a trewe knyght Off flessh and bone a semely creature, Full lyke a prince, so manly was hys porte, Bolde and hardy in eueryche aduenture, To any batayle when he shulde resorte, Hys people he koude so wele chere and comforte; Thus for the manhode that he hadde, All natyons hym lowyd and dradde. Weddyd was thys prince vnto a lady, Born off blode ryale and stoke off gentylnesse; I kan nat seye off what kyn or auncetrye, It berith in myn autor no witnesse, But thys I wote, she was to hym prynces, Which was full goode, right plesaunte and feyre; By hyr he bygat a doughter, which was hys eyre, Named Sismond, and when she was off perfyte age, In all the worlde sprange hyr grete beaute, That many a knight and squier off hygh corage Come to the princes place with grete ryalte, Who as myght beste atteyne in hyr grace to be, Many a fresshe knight and many a blysfull rowte On horse and foote mustringe in the cowrte aboute. Hyr to honoure they dyd all there entente, The syght off hyr there hertys kan so enbrace, Gode hath hyr such beaute and wertue sent, Fulfilled off all wertue and off all grace, Passing Penolepe and lucres off face, Ypolita and Emyles hyr yonge suster withall, No more lyke to theme then gete to cristall. She was white, ruddy, fressh and lowely hewyde, In all hyr body wes nat o wikkyd syng, And euery day hyr fayrnes anewyd, For it wes sadde, demwre and benynge; But, forsoth, I am to rude in endytinge The beaute off so fayre a lady to dewyse; She hadde more then in my witte may suffice. Off womanly porte and right comly stature, Full graciouse was hyr angelike visage; There was neuer none yit formyd by nature More treue and stedfast in hyr langage; Excellent, [stedfast], stable and right sage, In all hyr werkys soft and debonare; Hardly hyr tonge shulde none hurt nor enpayre. Hyr eloquens was spokyn with so mylde speche, With sad contenance, thus may I expresse, That, forsoth, she was a werreye lywys leche To all people stondinge in any hewynesse; Thus off all wertue she wes lady and mastres, And shortely to reporte the beaute that she hadde, For sothe, she myght be no fayrer nor better made. Grete lordys and that off euery naciowne, Fast labowringe to haue thys yonge lady, Dukys, erlys, lordys off grete reputacyoune, But the prince hyr fader lowyd hyr so enterely, Lothe he was with any off them to marry; At the last he assentyd with right grete payne To marry hyr with the erle off champayne. Long it was or euer he wolde accorde Vnto the lordys off hys covnsayle; Notwithstondinge spowsed she wes vnto thys lorde And within shorte tyme deth kan hym assayle; Dede was this erle, it ys withouten fayle; Such was hyr fortune in the begynnyng, Allace! full hewy also was hyr endinge. Then she wept and wayled, swonynge to Ã¾e grovnde, Was there newyr so wofull a creature, Syghing, sobyng, with sorow was she bounde; Merwaile it was that euer she myght endure; Hyr fader, seynge thys sodeyne auenture, So son wyffe and so sodeynly wedow; Wherfor with hewy hert he made a wow And seyd, wepyng: âI wys, doughtyr sismond, Yhe shall newyr marry by my wyll ayeyne; Accordyng to a lady yhe shall be fownde; Loke what plesure els in this worlde doth reyne, Yhe shall it haffe and also be certeyne Off all the goode I haffe aftyr my lywe, So tyll I lywe yhe shall be no wyffe. âFor yhe be my lywis ioy and worldys comfort, There ys no welth to me may be equipollent, Nor there ys wyght Ã¾at me [can] cheyre with dysporte, When so euer yhe be frome me absent; Myne affyaunce so holly ys to you lent, That iff ought come to you other then goode, Dry vp it wolde and consume myne hertys blode.â Sismond on knes downe to the grounde she goth And seyde vnfenyngly with hert enteyre: âLorde fader, it shall nat neyde to make none oth, Nor so depely youre doughter to requere; I am youre awne, yhe shall hafe youre desyre; To that yhe say I shall neuer say nay, But with hert diligent euer you plese and pay.â So ferforth she kan Ã¾e prince hyr fader ensure That she wolde neuyr to emperoure nor kynge, Nor to none estate nor erthly creature Be maryed whils he was lyffinge, But fulfyll hys entent in euery thinge, And shortly withoute any more delays So forth they endured ?ers and days. Thys yonge lady, which was fosterede so softly, In the floure off hyr youth and beste lyffynge, Which knew the wyll off hyr fader trewly, That for to mary hyr he wes nat wyllinge, Amonges all hyr fadyrs servauntys avysinge, Wheras wer foysoune of knyghts and squiers withall, One she thoght most perfyte in especyall. To be lowyd she thoght hym moste able and worthy, Wherfor she purposith in hyr remenbraunce For to passe hyr youth the more ioyusly And in hym only to take hyr plesaunce, Dayly beholdinge Ã¾e maners and contenance, The condyciouns in all hys behawoure, Hys curtace langage and clenlynesse of vesture. Euery day, as she sat at hyr fadyrs boorde, Hath she merkyd thys squier named Guystarde, Whom she thought feythfull in dede and worde, All oÃ¾er to hym no thinge lyke in regarde; Mars god off battayle so kept hyr hert in warde, Venus thought also to haue hyr desyre With lowe to set thys yonge ladyes hert afyre. Guystard of thys mater beynge full innocent, He vndrestoode by no manere off perseuerance, Nor knew no thing hyr desyrowse entent, That she to hymward had suche affyaunce, For as by hyr spech, looke, or contenaunce, He koude nat disserne, as fer as he myght se, But alle sche fawoured euery man ylyke fre. Also ther was men off gretare alyaunce Daly waytinge on the prynce at hys table, Euyr redy doynge there besy vtteraunce To plese thys yonge lady full honorable; But Guystard thought hym selff full vnable. Whi! he was in comparyson one off the lest; Natwithstondinge, forsoth, she lowyd hym best. For hys demenyng, softe, right gentile and meyke, Both whyte and rede, wele fawoured off vysage; Nortur and honesty, hardely, wor nat to seyke; Goodely behafyng hym in hys langage, By temperaunce mesuring hys corage; From all vnclen[n]es he wold hys tonge refreyne; Aftyr hys byrth hys lyffing dyd he maynteyne. Yonge and lusty, and right wele dysposyd, And what so euyr he hard sey euer where, Ther was no thing knawen by hym nor dysclosyd; But lord! so wele he koude hys clothys were; Hardely, there was nat seyne on hym so moche as one here; He vsyd all wertue longyng vnto a gentilman; He was withoute fawte, bettyr then I say kan. Sysmond with grete peyne duryng forth alway, Hyr lowe wexith euer to hym more fervent, She myght no lenger endure, but on a day Pryuely for Guystard hath she sent; Guystard come to hyr presence reuerentt, Wheroff Sismond was iocunde and wele payde; Discouering hyr hert, right thus to hym she seyde: âGuystard, the feyth that I haue in youre goodnesse And treuth fereth me to vtter diuerse thinge, The which tuch me ryght nye in sykyrnesse. My worship and welfare thereon ys dependinge, Wherfore yhe shall make me oblysinge That neuyr by you it shall be discouerd.â He with grete humblenes anone ansuerd And seyd: âmadame, doute yhe newyr more; By me ther shall wyt none erthly creature That yhe sey to me, thogh I shulde dy therfore, By my treuthe playnly to you I ensure.â âWele,â quod Sismond, âwit yhe that my pleasure Is on a gentilman, the which that I lofe Best next almyghti god abowe. âAnd for by cause that I may nat wele Speke with hym, nor haue no man to my behoffe To send hym myne hert and will euery delle, I will that yhe be the mean off oure loffe. Behold now iff I trust you moste abofe All oÃ¾er, whan I gyff you such power, Auenturing in your hondes myne honoure.â He knelyd downe and seyd with wordes stable: âMadam, I know welle in you ys such wit, That yhe woll do no thyng disco[ven]able; Wheroff I thonk you with right humble spiritt That it hath plesyd your hyghnesse to putt In me such a singular feyth and trust; Wherfore, gode lady, commaunde me what you luste, âAnd I shall obbey your ladyship full low, To my power be seruaunt to hym euer redy, So that I may wit what he ys and knowe The which hath the loffe of so fayre a lady, Off so high worship as yhe be, for treuly He hath nat fayled of a lowe honorable; Fortune was frendely that so dyd hym able.â Whan Sismond had hym wele prewyd in eche thing And hard hym speke so wittily, then she Toke hym by the hond, on thise wyse saying: âFrende guystard, wit yhe wele that yhe ar he Vhame I haue chosyn for myne oonly felicite, And here my treuth to lowe you euyr, Till ferfull deth you and me disseuyr. âFor me semyth the noblenesse of your corage, Fulfyllyd with so goode condicioune, Yeldeth you to haue a lady of high parage, Born to enherit right grete possessioune; Therfor here by pryve eleccioune, Chesyng you to my best byloued by name, Praying to youre lady lat me be the same.â Thys yong squyer abashed sore and thought, He so sympyll, and she suche lowe to hym caste; Hys hert ioyed, causyng hys colours change oft, As yong men of nature beth euer shamfast; Neuer the lesse with bolde spirit at the last Lowly he thonked hyr and, shortely, in grete syn Long tyme they continued there plesaunce in. Sysmond remenbring she muste fulfyll than The counand made to hyr fadyr as blyue; Vherfor she dorst nat marry thys yong man, Vhich cawsyd hyr wepe ane hundreth sythe, Bycause she myght nat hym to hyr husbond kythe; Not hyr fadyrs, it was hyr will inwardly To haue lyffid in the law of matermony. But enuyous fortune of there solace Woll suffer no longer thise lowers twayne To lyff in ioye, but turnyd it in allace, There disporte retorned in to payne. It befell apon a day in somyr certayne Sismond with hyr gentill women to take the eyre Valkyt in a garding right plesand and feyre. The same tyme hyr fadder, w[hich] that had None other pleasure but whan he Saw hyr, then was he ioyfull and glade, Vent all alone in the chawmyr to se Iff she in any besynes had be, But [n]ow the wyndows shyt there he saw And the curtens of the bed ydraw. Ther was no body, nor he hard no sowne; Venyng to hym therfor she had slept; So he wold nat awake hyr but layd hym downe By the beddys syde on a fayre paliett, And was full hard a slepe withouten lett; Sismond, when she had fynished hyr game, Come hyr way with hyr gentill women same. From the gardyn, when they had disportyd at the beste, Vnto the chawmer full fast she hyit, And layde hyr downe on hyr bed to take reste; How be yt hyr fadder yhit was nat espyed, W[hich] that still slept by the beddys syde; By non of theime he was nat apersewyd; Walawey! thus fooule wes she dysseywed. Netheles, she awoyded hyr gentilwomen, Shittyng all the dowres vnto hyr closse; Then, she beyng by hyr selff allon, and when She saw hyr tyme, wp from hyr bed arrose; Thus don, she goth into a lytill parclosse, Made within hyr wardrap full secrely, Vherin Guystard wes hyd full preuely. Forth she broght hym in to hyr chawmer anone, And within curtens betwene them devysinge, Venyng there selff to haue bene allone, The prynce awoke and had werrey vnderstonding A man wes with hys doghtyr, off which thyng He had so grete sorow, that with the peyne He wold haff rone vpon hym and hym haff slayne; Nor had beyne the goode consyderacioune, That he sulde dishonoure hys doghter and shame, Vhich cawsith hym by goode diliberacioune Humble hys hire and hys spirittys to attame, But welle he vndrestood what he was by name. Then full softly owte off the chawmer he gothe, Vherof thise lowers wyst none off hem bothe. But when thei had ynough hem dysportyd, The seyde Guystard departyd in that seasoune. The prince, w[hich] that made hym be awayted, Anon dyd take hym and put hym in presoune, Vhich wes to hym more odyouse then poysoune, That forsoth it passith my witt to expresse The sorow he had and infynite dures. Forthwith the prince come to hys doghter so dysmade, Wes then wepyng with noyus chere, Thereas she was allone, and to hyr sayde: âSismond, I wend haff had a doghter dere Off you, off all women moste chaste, withoute pere, Fayre, goode and wyse, but in somuche that I Am ouercome that I fynd you contrary. âAll the worlde belewe thys sulde me nat make, But iff I had it with myne eyne seyne, That euer yhe wolde eny erthly mane take, Except he had youre lorde housbonde beyne; Forsoth, now may I k[n]aw and werrely weyne, To torment me yhe purpose and shorte myne age Thrugh the lust off youre wykkyd vsage. âI am sure it will me bring to deth mortall, For the preseruyng off my nature ys lorne; Th[at] which encressith myne anger most of all Ys that youre noble corage, I dorste haff sworne, Hadde passed any lyffing woman borne; I se welle the contrary, because that yhe Haue takyn one off the leste in myne house, parde. âFor iff such a thing yhe wolde haue done, Of muche mor worthi and notable yhe myght Haue founde in my cowrte, men off high renoune, Thogh in Guystard yhe had nat take youre delyte, Which yeldeth me thys sorow and dispyte; Therfor I will that to you for treuth be quemyd, That for to dye in haste he shall be demyde. âThe same dome shulde yhe suffyr, so god me sawe, Iff so wor that from myne hert putt away I myght The grete feruent lowe, which that I to you haue, Gretter then euer had terrestriall wight Or fadder to hys doghter; where by off right I may nat do it, prudens doth me requere, All thogh I be lyke m[e]llybe as in ire.â When Sismond knew this thyng wolde be none othere, That to the deth hyr fader had hym [iustifyed], Whome so moche she lowyd, aboue all other, So sorowfull she was, she wold haff dyed; But sothely hyr wo was but lytill espyed; Full womanly, with corage right pacient, Stedfast chere, withoute any abashment, Paynyng her selff as Ã¾ogh she had not repentyd, And yhit she thoght no lenger to lyff that tyme, Saying: âfadder, s[it]he fortune hath consentyd To vtter and publysh thys defawte be [me], Vell ys that creature that neuer dyd cryme; Notwithstonding yhe know my ioy solitary, Which I [h]yde, that now ys to danger trybutary, âI haue no neyde to make you no manere of requeste, Except yff I myght haffe off you remissioune, The lyffe off hym that to dye yhe haff made byheste; Kepe hym, and I giff you my lyffe to guerdoune, For, how moche Ã¾at Ã¾ogh I aske you pardoune, Iff that yhe woll do by hym as yhe say, I desyre no lenger to lyff, but to day. âVherefor I make you full protestacioune That for hys deth yhe shall distroye me, Off the which thing yhe haue grete derysioune; Vnto ws and yhit yhe neyde nat wroth to be, But for to remenbre youre awne freylte, For yhe that be a man of flessh and bone withall Haue gette a doghter of the same mater carnall, â[Nat] off stone nor yryn, thys may yhe wele trowyn; But welle yhe wote it ys in youre fers mynde vnkouthe, As now yhe lyst not to be on it aknowen, Nor the hard passage consydyr off youthe, Lyffing in dilitys; allace! for werrey reuthe, The preking thereoff sore doth assawte, Attemptyng ryche and pore, be they neuer so hawte. âAnd forsothe youre selff wor to blame; for why?

The vhich hert forth brought to the prince it ys, In a riche cope off golde he kan it dresse, And by a secrete messinger off hys He send it hys doghter in grete fersnesse, Sending hyr worde that a present off noblesse He hath hyr sent, to make hyr mery and glade, Thyng off the world wheroff moste ioye she hadde, Lyke as she had made hyr glade off the thinge Off thys worlde which she had moste in cherete; Thys messynger to sysmond thys present delyuerynge, Saying as was gyffyn hym charge, and then she Opynned the cope with grete humilite; Anone she vndrestoode the auenture; Allace! the hard whille, ther was no cure. But how that she had sorow inestimable, Off no thing mewid, but by goode temperaunce Ansueryng bolde, with chere ameable, Vithoute changyng off faconde or contenaunce, And seyde: âmy frende, as in perseueraunce Off some thing the prynce ys wyse and excellent, As I haff conceywyd by thys present; âThat ys, that he to so nouble ane hert Hath gyffyn so noble a sepulture, As it bilongeth hym haff for hys desert; For other then off golde and off asure Aught he nat to haue and preciouse stones pure.â Then she obeyed the cope full lowly And kyssyd the hert, sayinge full petuously: âA! right suete hert, off all my pleasure the glory, Cursed be the cruelte off thys ignoraunce, Vhich that hath planted in my memory, Seyng the to ly here in thys myschaunce, Late ynogh in the syght through my remembraunce; Now hastow passyd the cours off thy noble lyve, Such is off wickyd fortune the dome actyfe. âThow hast such a sepulture at thyne enimys devyse As thi treuth and worthinesse hath [gayned]; So it behowith for thy last office, That thow be washen and also bayned With the terys off hyr that loffyt the vnfeynid; So moch vhereoff thou shalt nat fayle and also With that shall nat thy soule withoute hyrs goo. âFor it wor no reasoune, for in tyme brewe It shall goo with thyne, mavgre thyne aduersary; Fortune, that was chefe cause of this [mysc]heue, Is no[w] so befall vnto ws contrary; My cruell fadder sendyng me thys mortuary, To that entent my woo shulde be encresed, And that I shulde speke to the or I desesyd; âVheroff I desyre that my soule shulde be thyne, For this welle I wote, that thyne esperaunce Desyreth euer the felyship of myne; And seth it is so, that thou haste led Ã¾e daunce, I woll folow by processe off dethis traunce;â That, forsoth, she had so many a dulfull tearme, It wolde haue made eny maner hert to ?arme. And so depely she wept, that it semyd Lyke two spring wellys, rynnyng as a flode In hyr hede, the which withoute sesyng stremyd In to the cop off golde, and also bloode Mengyd with the[m] aboute the hert stoode; The sprenting of the salt teris to the bone Freting the chekys; so woo she was bygone. Kyssyng the hert tymis mo then I kan nombre, Withoute crye makyng, but with esy woyce; Thought dyd hyr hert perse and so encombre That she no pouste had to make noyse, But euer aftir deth she can reioyse; Hyr gentylwomen gretly mervaled, That wor hyr aboute, what that she ayled. For they off the auenture no thing knewe What was the cause of hyr sorow, but belyfe They wept all for piete and on hyr kan rewe, Paynynge hem gretely hyr spirittys to revyve, But anon [in] the porte of dispare to aryve She purposeth, so they with ioy nor gladnesse No koude hyr chere, so rype was hyr hewynesse. Such gentilwomen as wor moste pryve With hyr axed the cause of hyr deseas, But she shonnyd ther speche and then can seye: âI pray you, be peas, gretely yhe me deseas; Parde, it lyeth nat in you to appeas My sorow, nor in ioye me to delyte, For I ne yeue by all the worlde nat a myte.â And euer she sayde, withoute speche cessaunte: âO right dereworthy, biloued, suete hert! Honoure the I shall, vhyl I am vivaunte, And when the soule from the body doth stert, To the felyship off thyne it shall awertt; Vhere euer it become, in wo or welle, I gyf no fors, so it may the sequele.â Vhen she this hewy wordes sayde had, She rose vp and ane almery vntuined In hyr chawmer, vherein she had made In a pott herbys to be envenomed. Allace! thys sorow may nat welle be rymed, For she afore preuided and kan revolue Ãis poysoune in vater for to dissolue, To fynd redy, vhat case so euer shulde befall, Powryng the cope of golde full complete, Vheras the hert was, water and blode withall; She drank it of, as it wor hony suete, Ther was no fere nor drede that she tooke to kepe, But leyd hyr doune on bed, abyding deth, Tremelyng and quakyng, fast drawyng after breth. Vhen the ladyes and the gentilvomen Right sorowfull saw hyr in hyr vexacioune, Consewyng the signes off deth right then, They send hyr fadder worde off hyr tribulacioune, Vhich that was walked on hys recreacioune, And when it was tellyd hym of this dede, He come in grete haste, with hert hewy as lede. It happynyd ewyn as the we[n]yme Kan sprede and in all hyr wenys abounde, The prince with pale, dedely chere that tyme Come, with sorow that was almoste confounde; Vhen he saw hys doghter, he fell to Ã¾e grounde, Vepyng as a chylde and wrong hys hondes fast, So sore repenting hym he thoght hys hert brast. Then spak he to hyr wordes meke and fayre, Saying: âsuete sismond, be off good chere, for and [Iff] yhe morne, it woll me bring to dispayre.â Thus he wende to haue esyd hyr off hyr bande Vith his comforth, but deth was at the hande, Crampyshyng hyr lymes, gone was hyr syght; Yhit she ansuerd hyr fader as she myght, And sayde: âtawker, be still, iff thou kan, Thy teris, for they stonde me to none effect; Thow resemblest as [he whych slowe Ã¾e] man, Aftyrward repenting and hym bywept; Had it nat bene better for to haff kept Thy sorowfull doghter in ioye lyffyng, At hyr pleasure secretly a man lowyng, âThen for to se by thy cruell execucyoune Hyr hard deth, to thyne endelesse langoure? The vhich deth shall be gyde and direccioune, Causyng opyn knawlege of thys erroure, The which was secrete and now ys rumoure; It shall mak thing that hyd was and vnknawyn Through all the worlde to be owyrsawyn.â In somoch myght sismond no lenger speke, Ãe throwys of deth no lenger wolde delay, She haldyng the cope still, hyr hert kan breke, Yheldyng vp the spirytt for euer and ay. There was but âallace! allas!â and âwalaway!â Some wept, some cryed, and some fell in swone; It was a petuose syght and a hydows sowne. The wofull fader so sory in that stounde, Seyng hys moste ioye off the worlde agone, He made a grete krygh and fell to grownde, No mo wordys spak, but dede as stone. Thus was there sorow and mone vpon mone; Vherfor it hath be spokyn aforne agoo: âAne hasty creature neuer wanteth woo.â Vpon the prince thys may be verifyed, Vhich was hasty in fersnes hawtayne, Vithoute iugemente causyd the man that he dyed, Vhos deth hath hys awyn doghter slayne, And off hyr deth he tooke such endelese payne, He dawed neuer goode day but wes dede; All the worlde wondred on hys folyhede. Ensample of this euery wyse man take, Vhat it is to be cruell in violence, And off a secrete thing a wondre to make, Through hasty ire wantyng pr[o]u[i]dence. Euery man remenbre hys awne neclegence, And wice in to wertue to plant and roote, For trewly ayenst love there is no boote. For, certys, of trew lufarys it is the gyse, Vhen there trouble and vexacioune is moste sore, They woll love yche other in more hertily wyse Ane hundreth fowlde then euer they dyd afore; Youth will to youth and lofe to lufe euermore; And, shortly, thys processe for to conclude, Yche thing drawith vnto hys similitude. And betuix thes lowers it did apere, Vhich wer both yong and in fluryshyng age; For there trouble they lowyd the bettyr in fere And passid of deth the dredefull passage. Allace! the letyng of there maryage Vas cause of this myschefe, withouten faile; Lo! vhat it is to be ayeyenst spowsail. Vherfor this prince stondeth in grete peraile, That to [the] l[a]w of wedlok wolde nat enclyne, And a tyraunt beynge fers and fell, Causyng Guystard be putt to mortall fyne; Off whos soule if I shall determyne, I truste to god hys feithfull entencioune Vas the cause off hys endelese saluacioune. For why? he thought none harme to none erthly wight, And at the requeste off Sismonde he dyd consent; Natwithstondyng, I trust to god almyght It shall be to hyr soule none impedyment, For to haff be maryed it was hyr entent; Then rekkyn the sorow that she had withall And grete contricioune to hyr ende fynall; That, hardely, she ys in the blysse celestiall, For off feith and treuth of all lufarys suremountyng She was, and a m[i]roure to women all, Ensample of treue and stedfast lowe gyffyng; Wherfore I beseche hym that off all thyng Is lorde and gouernoure, comforth ayeyenst baile, Graunte thise lowers ioye: so endyth my taile. Go forth, lytill tayle, full bare off eloquens, Vith humble sprete make thi supplicacioune; Prey all tho, theras thou comyst in audiens, To haue piete on thy symple translacione, Oute off prose by myne vnkonnyng directioune Made in balade; wherfor myne innocence Submytting lowly vnto coreccioune And supportacion of youre benevolence, Besekyng all the maisters of this science Me holde excused, for goode ys myne entencion, Thogh I florysh nat with metyr and cadence, Off rethoryk and poetry makyng mencioune; Such clerkly werkys passith my discrecion; Natwithstonding, if here be fawte or offens, Speke to Gilbert banester, which at the mocioune Off Iohn Raynere this made aftir Ã¾e sentence. Explicit legenda Sismond The Tale of Guiscardo and Ghismonda [MS. R. 3. 19 at Trinity College, Cambridge]A version from a later MS. has been omitted, except for two stanzas which have been extracted from it to supplement MS. R. 3. 19. [T]ancret, that was prynce of Salern, Floure of knyghthode and myrrour of provesse, Whiche reioysyd euer hys pepyll to gouern Wyttyly, by benygnyte and gentylnesse, Eueryman musyd of hys gret noblenesse; Discrete in all thynges that was iudiciall, Of nature the verray welle of yeftys lyberall, Hys lawes he kept so iustly thorough all the prouynce, Repreuyng all ryot and cherysshing the porall, And mercyfull also as was any prince; And, shortly, as myne auctor maketh rehersall, Hys fame had neuyr spot in all hys gouernall, Tyll hasty crewelnes causyd of gret yre The fatall loue of tweyn that loue had set on fyre. A wyfe he toke whyche was com of blod ryall, But of what auncetre or of what lynage, What was hyr name, or what men dyd hyr call, Forsoth, I cannat sey, but of som hygh parage Men may well know: she was ryche in maryage To be ioynyd with suche a prince as was thys Tancret. Therfore I passe ouyr, I take therof no [hede]. Thys nobyll prynce Tancret had neuer issew In tyme of all hys lyfe for to be hys heyre, Save oonly a doughtyr, whom nature and vertew Exce[lle]ntly endowyd, so was she good and feyre. But o! cruell desteny, that myrth doth oft apeyre, Aftyr gret gladnes makyng men to morne, For better had be to Tancret the chyld had neuer be borne. The following stanza is not extant in MS. R. 3. 19 and has been taken from a later MS. But all that was full ferre fro his minde, He red not in the booke of her Destinye, Her fatall chaunce was to him derke and blinde; Let all this passe: This childe was put to norye, Daily she increased in fauour and beautÃ© So that when her nonage passed and her youth Her noble fame &amp; beautÃ¨ was in ich mans mouth. Yef I shuld dyscryue thys beuteuous creature, Nature had hyr specially in remembraunce, For she was well and semely of feature, Hyr chekys myxt whyte and rody, the myrrour of pleasaunce; A spere hit was to louers, hyr goodly countenance; Her beaute nat made by oynement nor by other gere, But of hyr owne kynde, as nature gafe to here. She excellyd in bewte the Ipermy[s]ture, Penolope of grece and eke the fayre Elien, Ipolita also and Emly hyr systure, Meliorir and Vrake, and also Poli[x]ene; In stedfast loue she passyd fayre Dydo the quene, Feythfull and trew, without daungerous dysdeyn, Curtes and debonair, she was nothyng soleyn. Also, to speke of hyr pregnaunt wyt, Hyr parfyte mynde, also intelligence, Nothyng was so harde but [she] sone conceuyd hyt; In fer sotell castyng she had experience; What shuld I more say? shortly in sentence, She knew more haply then was conuenient Vnto any woman orels expedient. Lyke as the nobyll prynce of issew had no more Saue oonly thys chylde, so louyd he hyr only; All hys hert and mynde was set on hyr so sore, He louyd no creature so effectually; So in hys mynde he determynyd vtterly To kepe thys lady present all wey in hys syght, And neuer to graunt hyr in mariage to no wyght. Though that princesse ryall, to whom of hygh fauour Fortune had grauntyd gret enherytance, Desyryd to haue thys lady to loue paramour, Euyr to be trew vnder hyr obeysance, And so by matrimony to make alyaunce, But thowgh Cupyd woundyd theym with hys fyry dart, Yet wold nat her fadyr sofer her to depart. So, shortly for to tell, thys mayde fro hyr desyre Was also compellyd for to abstayne; Though youth, lust and corage brent hyr as the fyre, Yet myght she neuer the plesaunce of hyr loue attayne, But contynued styll mornyng, beyng euyr in payne, Tyll many of hyr lusty yeres were ago; Hyr owne cruell fadyr dyd hyr all thys wo. Hyt fortunyd on a tyme, I know nat in what wyse, [Whe]ther that hyr fadyr hauyng gret compassion Vppon hyr gret wo, orelles for some promyse Of gold, ryche tresure, orelles of possession, But, shortly, of Cumpeny to the dukes son He grauntyd hys doughter to haue in maryage, A man of blod royall and of hygh parage. Hyt nedeth nat to reherse the ryche apparaill To these ij louers, the day of theyr weddyng, Or vnto my purpose what may hit avayle To tell the royall [feest] and all the guydyng? Of thys I passe ouer, I make no tareyng, I speke nat of the myrthe and melady that was; As for a conclusion, thus weddyd they were. Of sorowfull mornyng now ys the clowdy nyght Be the fyre of love dryuyn fer away, The feruent son of plesaunce shynyth now full bryght, Hys fresh son bemys hath chaungyd nyght to day, She may daunce and syng, now hath she lyst to play, For euyr aftyr mornyng the myrthe ys the swetter, And aftyr gret sorow the ioy shalbe the bettyr. But lyke as lusty Phebus with hys fyre bemys, When he hys goldyn chare hath brought vnto the west, Anon he withdraweth hys hote brennyng stremes And then appereth pheb[e] out of hyr clowdy nes[t], Then comyth all the derk, then men draw to rest, Vntyll on the morow that lucifer doth appere, Whyche ys callyd the day ster, the dayes messyngere; Ryght so the shynyng son of hyr plesaunce Was hyd and wrappyd with wepyng and with clowdy rayne: Forthwith, in lytyll space of contynuaunce Aftyr theyr weddyng deth departyd theym agayne; I wot nat by what mene her lord, hyr souerayne, In sekenes or in batayllâI can no knowlage haue; But, shortly, thys dukes son, her hosbond, ys leyde in graue Allas! departyng, ground of heuynesse, Cursyng the clowdy nyght of carefull deuorce; O cruell dethe! I mene dystroyer of gladnesse, Dysdeynyng the plesaunce of thys wofull corps. Why woldest thow of malyce assaut hyr thys with vorce, Eclypsyng the clerenes of hyr ioyfull day, Bryngyng forth the nyght of care and welaway? Falsly thow robbyd hyr [of hyr] hertes plesure, Takyng away fro hyr that she louyd best. Out on the, that art the comyn thefe of nature, That hast take fro hyr all pese and hertes rest! Wold god she on the myght call a quest Of loues seruauntes, and for all thyne art Thow shuldyst be done to deth with thyne own dart. What nedeth hyt more to speke of thyne enuy, When thys wofull woman shall neuer be the bettyr? For that that hath byn the cause of all melody, Yef hit be oft rehersyd, hit maketh the wo the grettyr; Wherfore my pen shall wryte no more therof, no letter; But though thys woman wepe, I can non other rede; Hyt helpeth hyr nothyng, for hyr housbond ys dede. How shall she now be rewlyd she taketh hyr councell; Voyde of all comfort for lak of a gyde, Anon she hath concludyd in hyr mynde ryght well At home with hyr fadyr she thynketh to abyde, And there to leue hyr sorow, yef hit wold betyde, Whereas all hyr sorow furst of all was take, And wydow to hyr fadyr she came in clothes blake. Thynges artyfyciall that byn violent Wrought, orels made for causys accidentall, May nat endure euer, for when the cause ys shent, The effect therof shall sone fade and fall. Why shuld thys woman then any lengor s[t]ay at all, Syth the cause of mornyng ys fro her cast; The deth of hyr hosbond hyt ys so fer past? Yef she shuld abyde also euyr styll, In paynes and wofull care continu and endure, Withyn short space she shold hyr sylf spyll, For sorow ys a poyson that nothyng may cure; Hyt bryngeth hertes power ryght low to the lure, Hyt maketh also fayrenes fall and all bewte, Hyt ys the grettest sekenesse that ther may be. So she abydyng [still] in hyr fadyrs house, Yong and corageous and also of hygh degre, With affluence of all thynges that was delycyouse; But when at the last she began pursew and se That for love hyr fadyr intendyd that she Shold neuermore aftyr any housbond crave, But styll to dwell with hym tyll he be leyde in grave; Thus then hath hyr fadyr determynyd vtterly Neuyr to procure for hyr mariage, And hyrsylf to aske she semyd hyt were vylany, She thought therfore to take hyr best avauntage, Yef she myght aspy a man of good lynage, So that he were gentyll, to take hyr owne choyse, And in that eleccion her fadyr shuld haue no voyse. Thys noble Tancret had in hys houshold, As in a prynces court ys wont for to be, Both lordes and knyghtes corageous to behold, Som gentylmen, som yemen, som of low degre; Among all thys pepyll she gan to loke and se Yef she cowde fynde any that was to hyr plesure, Whom she wold loue euyr, whyle she dyd endure. So dayly in hyr mynde she was full dylygent For to note euery man in hys demenaunce; Who was best norturyd, who was fre and gent, Who wysyst for to talke and had best vtteraunce, Who vertuous in maner, with euery circumstaunce; But aftyr she had consyderyd the houshold euerychon, She hath gyfe all hyr love to Gunstard alon. Thys gentylman was bore of pore auncetry; Fortune hath dysdeyne[d] hys lytell auenture, But nature hath indewyd hym so excellently With semelynes of person and also nurture, With maners that were euyn gentyll and demure, Was neuer appayryd thorow any langage, But well of euery man to sey was hys vsage. He was of port euer lowly and therto curtays, So well demenyng hym in all hys gesture, That when he fond thys lady syttyng at the days, Hardly, he lacked no poynt of nurture; Clenly in all hys aray and hys changure, Gydyng hym so manerly in euery dysport, That euery man reioysyd hys vertues to report. The lady so well had consydered the squyer, Hys gentyll hert, hys nature, with hys demenaunce, That hym to loue oonly was all her desyre And he aperceuyd well the apperaunce Of hyr cherefull ey and of hyr countenaunce, That of benygne loue she daunceth in the trace, The whyche hath bound hyr hert with hys goldyn lace. But where she set hyr love he wyst in no case, Tyll onys he fortunyd to stond before that lady, And she beholdyng hym with dedly pale fase, Nat spekyng a worde, she gaue a gret sygh, And anon with that she gan withdraw hyr ygh, Castyng downe hyr loke fer in to the ground; So womanly shamefast she stood a gret stound. And when thys yong louer was brought in lovys daunce Had of hyr intent so gret experyence, He was nat dull of wyt but gaue attendaunce, Hyr to plese and serue he dyd hys diligence; Cupyde hath smyt hym with so gret feruence Of loue, that theyr hertes togedyr byn bounde, Both persyd with on dart, two louers with on wounde. Ryght ioyfull he was he stode in the grace Of thys fayre lady, but euer he drad fortune; âAllas!â he sayd, âthe whele that turneth in lytell space Thy dowbyll chere vnstable, that neuer wylt con[tune], More variaunt and flyttyng then ys the mutabyll mone, I fere that thow of enuy wylt cause my souuerayn Vppon my symple byrth of daunger [to] dysdayn. âYef as yet I know her hert both trew and stedfast, And she began also to profre loue, Allas! why shuld I then fere and be agast, Or put defaut in hyr? o! mercy, god aboue, For all the tresour in erth hyt wold nat me behove That my hertes ioy, my lady, herof wyst I put in hyr any such mystryst. âAnd also, percase yef that she louyd me nat, Yet wold I in hyr seruice continually perseuer, Hyt nedeth nat thys to argu by resons, for I wot Loue hath hyr hert enbrasyd me for to loue euyr.â What, shall I lengor tary? shortly, they had leuyr Eche of theym to dy then to depart from othyr, More feruently they louyd then dyd sustyr or brothyr. So that betwene theym both that louyd in thys wyse, They desyred oonly for theyr gret plesaunce By som sotyll menes how they myght deuyse For to speke togedyr and haue theyr dalyaunce; They wyll put no trust nor affiaunce To any man alyfe thys mater for to tell, But euyn to theymsylf they kept hyt councell: Tyll apon a tyme of soden auyse The woman found a mene that was a gret cavtyle, As oftyn tyme hyt fareth that wemen byn ryght wyse, And in a sodeyn case they byn ryght subtyle; She telleth hym hyr intent by wrytyng euerydele, And the lettyr, closyd in a rede spyre, She bad hym take the mayden, for to styre the fyre. Gunstard remembryd well that for som preuy case The reede was take to hym; he dyd hyt sone vnclose, And when he sy the lettyr he made lytyll pavse; Syttyng in a stody, anon he arose, For to rede the lettyr he gan hym sone dyspose, Whyche thys lady made of hyr owne indytyng, She was hyr owne secretary, hyt was hyr owne wrytyng. The tenure of thys letter was thys and all the effect: âI send vnto yow gretyng with loue and hert entier, Nat bold by rehersayll my counsell to detect For dredefull shamefastnes; wherfore thys messyngere Shall do all thys entyrpryce, whos countenaunce and chere Changeth for no shame; therfore these lettres blake, I pray yow, dysdeyne yow nat to rede theym for my sake; âCertyfying yow, myne owne hertys plesaunce, Of all my worldys rest my ioy and my comforture, That my lyfe, my deth, as in a balaunce Dependeth and hongeth only in your cure; In yow oonly ys put all myn aventure, Wherfore now, I pray yow that ye be nat straunge, For I ensure yow truly my loue shall neuer chaunge. âAnd I trow serten that your gentyll hert Dysdeyneth nat my love ne ys nat daungerous, Consyderyng your byrth and your gret pouert, And I suche a lady both yong and beuteuous; For Cupide knoweth well and hys modyr Venus, That oonly for your vertues and your gentylnes I set my loue on yow and for no gret ryches. âBut because my fadyr algates hath made an oth That I shall neuyr be maryed, whyle that he ys lyuyng, To suffre me depart fro hym he ys full loth; But lusty youth and corage lyke as the fyre brennyng Hath chose yow for my souerayn all my lyfe enduryng, And also love hath shewyd of hys hygh fauour The menes for to saue all worshyp and honour. âRemembreth well, ther ys by my fadyrs place A dongeon depe and strong, fer vndyr the ground, The whyche for all hys entre hath no more space But an hole above that lytell ys and round, And because the wey ys neyther vsyd ne found, With busshes and breres hyt ys all ouer grow, So that the depe dongeon may no man se or know. âOut of thys gret pyt ther ys a secret wey By a posterne dor that stondeth full pryuyly, Strong barres with postes and shut with lok and key, That ledeth vnto the chambre the euyn streyt wey, Ther as I in slepyng wont for to ly; And by gret dysvse that wey ys out of mynde, Thys lytell posterne dor no man can hyt fynde. âTyll at the last that loue, to whom nothyng ys hyd, The whyche for euery sore can fynde a remedy, Thys wey vnto my mynde sone hit hath reducyd; But, hardly, I taryed nat, I hastyd for to hy, On barres and on lokkes I gan to loke and pry, And at the last, with payn and gret labour, I haue found all the craft for to vndo the dor. âBy my sylf alon I went in to the cave, I saw the lytell hole where ys the entryng, How and in what wyse ye may your sylf save Ayenst all maner perell in thyder comyng; The heyght and the depth I send yow by wrytyng, So that ye nede nat to fere for mysauenture; Ye know now where and when ye may haue your plesure.â And aftyr thys anon in hyr indytyng Ther was a lytell clause for the conclusion, As ys comyn vsage in euery wrytyng, Where hyr name shold be, callyd the subscripsyon; She wrot ther: âBy your owneâ and made no mencyon Of hyr name, ne no more, tyll aftyr a gret stound, And then, with sore syghyng, she addyd âSismoundâ. The following stanza is not extant in MS. R. 3. 19 and has been taken from a later MS. What maruaile now if he be not pensiue? Now he hath rad this letter of comfort And from his deedly sorrow turns againe to liue, Sith he has almost raught the lustie port Of pleasance, lust, solace and of all disport: Wherefore he hasteth full besely and hieth To meet his Ladie as the letter specifieth. Who now but thys Gunstard with all hys dylygence To thys plesaunt iorney spedyth hym a pace, Euery oure that he ys out of hyr presence Semyth vnto hym a thowsand yere of space, But though the sloggyd carcas be fer fro hyr face, Yet with the flyghty wynges of amorous desyre He ys euer in hyr seruyce, brennyng hote as fyre. A corde he let ordeyn anon of gret leynght, And fast vnto a bussh about he dyd hyt ty, Fret full of knottes, suffycient of streynght, By the whyche vnto the pyt hymsylf he myght conuey To close hym in ledyr he let puruey, Fro busshes and breres to kepe hymsylf sure, And thus toward the pyt he went in suche armure The bryght ey of the world, when the shynyng day Withdraweth and also Tytan with hys sprynkelyng lyght, Than thys yong louer taketh hys iournay Toward the gret pyt, abydyng ther all nyght, Tyll on morow Aurora shone full feyre and bryght; Then som to hawke and som to hunt and som to theyr labour, Than began thys lady to com out of hyr toure. Remembryng hersylf well, ner the [n]yght was gon, Of theyr couenaunt made by iust apoyntment; All hyr gentilwemen and maydenys euerychon Anon in to hyr gardyn to sport and play she sent, Feynyng hyr sylf syke, and for that entent She sayd vnto hyr chambre she wold go full ryght, For to take hyr rest, slepe yef she myght. The dorrys and wyndowes she closyd anon full sure, And then toward the dongeon she toke the streyte wey, Where she found Gunstard; with hertes plesure They kyssyd, then ioyfully she began to say âGood god, gramercy, that I may se thys day, To speke with hym that ys my worldys plesaunce, In whom ys all my trust and all my hoole affiaunce.â She brought hym to the chambyr, thys lady beauteuous, Hyr fresshe apparayll was both lusty and gay, Hyr surcote goold, well furryd with ermyne precyous; A fayre myrrour of loue hyr beaute with aray; So, shortly [for to tell], I can no more say. But constru ye that byn louers what thay dydâ I can say no more, but long they there abyd. When they semyd best they partyd a sondyr, They wold nat tary lengor ne dayly theyr sportes vse, For dayly commyng causeth men oft to wondyr, And also long tareyng maketh theym to muse; And specyally the wemen[s] shrewde tonges wyll accuse Your noble fame and sey that [your] lyfe ys nought, Though ye neuer offend in dede nether in thought. Wysely they prouydyd to eschew infamy, And because all thynges shold secretly be kept, She went in to hyr gardyne anon full hastyly, Where hyr gentylwemen played, seying she had slept, But at nyght Gunstard out the pit crept; So commyng to hys lady and goyng by nyght away, Contynuyng theyr plesure, tyll aftyr many a day That fortune at the last treson falsly compast, Dysclosyng all hys counsell by mysaventur; All hyr lusty plesaunce was chaungyd at the last In to cruell deth at theyr departure. O fortune inconstaunt, that euyr art vnsure Bryngyng hertes lyght to woo when they be wele, Hyt semeth thow art nat able to rule thy whele! Hyt ys next in our proces to speke of Tancret, The nobyll prynce hyr fadyr, whyche for the gret feruence For tendyr loue and affeccion moche more then was nede, He delytyd somoche in hyr talkyng and eloquence That he vsyd a custom and of gret frequence To com vnto the chambre of hys doughtyr feyre, And aftyr they had talkyd home agayne repeyre. In the mery season of somer, [feyre] and hote, When euery thyng revyueth by course of nature, And wynter with hys frosty berde and hys frysyd cote Ys put in to exyle, and may no lengor dure, Then somer yeueth hys lyuerey with hys besy cure, New clothyng all the erthe in a lusty grene, Embroudyd full of floures ryght fresshly besene, Steryng hertys lyght in gardeyns for to walke; So dyd thys lady Sismounde for hyr gret plesaunceâ That was her nameâand, pluckyng the floures fro the stalke, She made a fressh garlond, therwith she thought to daunce; But in the mene whyle, allas! the vnhappy chaunce, Hyr fadyr on a custom, as he was wont to do, Only to talke with hyr he ys to hyr chambyr go. But he perseuyd she was in hyr dysport, Ryght loth he was to let hyr recreacion, He wold for nothyng hys doughtyr dyscomfort Ne dysquyet hyr, tyll she had all doon; Forth in to the chambre he entred ryght soon, The curteyns were draw and by the beddes syde He set hym behynde a curtayn hys doughtyr to abyde. As he sat styll, slepe dyd hym so encombre, He wexed all vnlusty and so sompnolent, That lenyng to the bed he began to slombre. O thow vntrusty fortune! what ys thyne entent? To dystroy thys lady hyt thow hast ment; Where thow lyst bewry, thow kepyst no counsell; That shold be kept secret thow tellest euerydell. O prynces doughtyr, Sismounde! infortunat was thy byrth, And also ryght vnhappy, when thow gan furst wurne With law in hys palyce; thy plesaunt won of myrth Ys com to the hyghest and now begynneth to turne; Aslake, thow malycyous saturne! I trowe ther be som enuy or malycyous aspect, Of all thys feruent loue thow hast brokyn the effect. Thys lady Sismound, thynkyng no deceyte ne gyle, Departyd from hyr gentilwomen and to hyr chambre went, And so forth to the pyt within a lytell whyle, Where she found Gunstard all redy present; But lytell afore thys she had [for] hym sent; And when they were com in, they had no mystrust, They knew nobody there, they dyd all that theym lust. But when hyr fadyr sawe the abhominable cryme, Aftyr that he owt of hys slepe was awak[e], He thought to haue cryed, but for a lytell tyme He semyd hit was best to let hys angor slake, And esyly hys payne with hymsylf to take; He made no noyse ne steryng, but euer sate styll, Tyll they had all theyre plesaunce aftyr theyr owne wyll. And aftyr they departyd, as they had done afore, Gunstarde vnto the pyt, and she to the wymen, Thys wofull man hyr fadyr wold tary there no more, But hom he went in hast and callyd forth hys men, Of the whyche he sent a certeyn vnto the den For to take Gunstard, when he shuld come thens, And bad they shuld bryng hym to hys owne presens. When thys man came vp, anon they hym arest, With dede and pale vysage for verrey fere he shoke, All they had compassion on hym, both most and lest, And forth in the same aray as they hym toke They brought hym to the prynce and [he] gan on hym loke With gret wrathe and angor, verrey pale of chere, Seying vnto Gunstard as ye shall after here. âGunstardâ, he sayd, âmy loue and tendyr fauour, The gentyl hert, that I haue shewyd to yow, Hath nothyng deseruyd so gret a dyshonour Done to me and myne, as ye haue do ryght now; Seyng mysylf all thyng what ye dyd and how, That trewly, so that I myght my worshyp saue, I wold I were dede and beryed in my graue.â Thys gret rebuke contynually went euyn to [the] hert Of Gunstard, whyche for shame can nat speke oon worde, Tyll a[tt] the last with corage boldly forth he stert, Seying no more but thys: âremembre yow, my lorde, Experience, I trow, of my sentence wyll acorde, The myghty power of loue ys strengor and the bonde Then eyther yow or I haue power to withstond.â But all thys excuse was in vayn, saunce fayle, So was hys mynde with malyce and yre obnub[i]lat. Alas! where malyce regneth, ther may non excuse avayle; A gret abusyon hyt ys a ruler to be impassionat; O ye worthy prynces! therfore, to whom of hygh estat The gydyng ys commyttyd of noble regyons, Well ye ought to take hede to rule your pa[ssyo]ns! Committeth nat wylfully sensualyte, Agayn the ryghtfull conscience of reson to put restreynt; Beth nat rulyd only by myrthe and volunte, Oppressyng by [m]yght and power theym that be weke and feynt, Wherby your noble fame ys oftyn hurt and atteynt; Hyt causeth also the pepyll in tyme of your dystresse To draw from yow theyr fauour and herty feythfulnesse. To euery glosyng tale yeueth nat to sone credence, Let nat hast ne symplenes gyde your iugement; Remembre well, yef ye dyffyne your sentence, What shalbe the ende and all the hoole entent; Rule yoursylf dyscretly by good auysement; Remembre the prouerbe, seying of long ago: âA cruell hasty man wanteth neuer wo.â Whyche [ys] preuyd by Tancret, whos cruell hastynes Hath commyttyd Gunstard anon to pryson, Committyng hym in gyves and in gret dures As a traytour gylty of prodicion; And aftyrward, agayn all reason, Thys innocent was [do] to deth so furyously, That euery man abhorryd to here the tyrauntcy. What man of hys wyt ys so dull and hard That cannat thynk here by ymaginacion The gret thought thys lady had for her Gunstard? Sore troubelyd in hyr slepe by dreme and vysyon, Her mynd was set on hym by suche impressyon, That both of well and wo and all hys aventure Was shewyd to hyr in slepe by verrey fygure. I trow she had ryght ferefull vysyons and dremys, When hyr loue was prysonyd in that wofull nyght; In wepyng hyr eyen watered lyke to stremys, And euyr she thought Gunstard stode before hyr syght, Holdyng in a cowpe an hert all blody dyght; Hymsylf eke spreynt with blood, he dyd hyr salew, Spekyng: âfarewell, Sismonde, thys ys my last valew.â And she thought hyr answer was to hym anon: âAllas! wyll ye so sone make a departure, And voyde of all comfort, leue me thys alon? Ye shall nat so, dere hert, for certeyn, I ensure, I shall but onys drynk and do my best cure To go with yow; how so your iorney torne, My hert and youres togedyr shall euermore soiorne.â And sodenly with that, out of hyr slepe she start, As woman from hyrsylf; she was so sore afrayed, She thought of verrey deth the swerde wen[t] to hyr hert; And thys, with sore wepyng, by hyrsylf she prayed: âO myrrour of all wymen! mylde maydyn!â she sayd, âFrom all shame and veleny my love and me defend, And helpe that my dreme non euyll to me pretend.â All thyse and many mo thynges co[niec]turall May well be ymagynyd by persuasion; But all thys ys but figuryd as dreme fantasticall, And eke myn auctor maketh therof no mension, So that I thinke [to make] no maner digression, Endytyng any poynt that ys nat pertynent Vnto my furst purpose or to my furst entent. Wherfore, I wyll procede to speke furst of Sismonde Whyche of Gunstardes duresse had no notyce, Saue oonly by hyr dremys, tyll aftyr a gret stounde Tancret cam to hyr chambre, as was hys old gyse, And she anon with reuerence agayn hym gan aryse, Welcommyng hyr fadyr with obeysaunt lowlynes, Whyche sayd vnto hyr as I shall expres: âDoughtyr,â he sayd, âSismond, your womanly port, Your vertuous talkyng and goodly demenaunce, Your stedfast hert and gydyng haue such su[pp]ort, Trusty in your sadnes with hole affiaunce, That ye of lusty Venus to the voluptuous plesaunce Without assent geuyn, I mene of maryage, Wold nat haue takyn yoursylf, for all your hygh corage. âBut I se well my wyt was dull and blynde, For truly I wold haue demyd the gret occyan Shuld sonner haue dryed vp, flamyng ayenst kynde, Then ye wold onys haue thought to be a myswoman, For yef I had nat sene the dede, where and whan, Shuld neuer man haue causyd me to haue supposaill That ye wold haue done so, but hyt had be spousaill. âRemembryng yow therof what hurt and gret damage Ye dyd vnto your byrth and also blood royall, [When ye, lyke] a woman of gordell and p[r]ostrage, Toke what cam to hond a[s] chaunce wold fall; Hyt semeth ye put no dyfference betwene get and berall, Now to yow a flynt and a dyamounde, Pesyn as good as perles oryent and rounde. âFro all goodly womanhede ye be degenerant, Whyche of worshyp souerayn ys desyrous; But ye peruert all thys, ye be so varyant, Toke in stede of worshyp your lust voluptuous, And trewly in comparyson your offence were nat greuous, Yef ye had take suche oon as had be couenable To your nobyll byrth and to yow agreable. âBut in all thys region, hyt semeth by your choyse, Lord, knyght, ne squyer was non to your pleasure, Of blood royall ne other in whom ye couth reioyse, Saue oonly in pore Gunstard, whos byrth and a[uen]ture Fortune of hygh dysdeyn hath take nothyng in cure, Whyche of gret pouert in tyme of mysery Without any releve had dyed for penury; âSo that to my cruell deth dayly I r[e]we; Deth?

But of yow, Sismound, I geve nat yet sentence. âFor I may well resemble as in my vagous mynde A shyp without anker, lackyng a sterne also, Whyche by the stormy rage of euery furyous wynde As a thyng vnstabyll [ys] ay chasyd to and fro; Semblably as now I am oon of tho; My dowtefull mynde ys brought to such perplexyte A[nd] cast fro syde to syde betwene iustyce and pyte. âFurst iustyce meveth me for to do correccion, Rewardyng euery wyght aftyr hys desert, Do som love and gret fauour, som payn and affliccion, But mercy with fadyrly pyte so stereth my tendyr hert, That hyt permytteth me nat s[e] ne advert Your crymynall offence, but rather doth hit excuse, So that betwene theym both I stand as a man confuse.â And forthwith anon he fell on wepyng, As a yong infaunt sore scorgyd or bete; In all worldly plesaunce reioysyd he nothyng, Sorow and shame feruently by the hert hym fret, Seying nothyng, but thus sat styll, full mewet: âDoughtyr,â he sayde, âfor your part, yef ye wyll aske mercy To pardon your offence, forsoth, I am redy.â But when Sismound saw how hyr love Gunstard In pryson was enteryd, kept with cheynys strong, That fortune also to her was so crewell and hard, But publysshed all hyr counseyll that secret had be long, For with gentyls and mynstrellys hyt was a comon song, So that euery man in all the contrey rownde Spake of the infortunat love of Gunstard and Sismound; Wherefore she plunged so fer in to the pyt of sorowes depe, I trowe that euery hert, whyche of gentylnes ys tendur, Yef I shuld tell her payn, wold also morne and wepe; Full oft she wrang her fyngyrs long and sklendure, Seying: âall worldly plesaunce now I here surrendyr, For my love Gunstard ys iuged to dy, I wyll do the same, ther ys no more to sey. âWherfore, o thow cursyd fortune!

We thought hyr dowbyll promyse had be stedfast and trew, Blaundysshyng euyr with suche contyn[au]nce and chere, As though our sonny plesaunce shuld euyr [shyne] clere. âBut now I se ryght well she begynneth for to chaunge, Syth ye of all oure councell haue pleynly notyce, Syth fals ys fortune, euyr varyaunt and straunge; But how ye com to knowlege or in what wyse, My wyt ys rude and dull, I cannat hit deuyse, Whedyr by experience or by informacion, By force prestigious or som supersticion. âAnd wold god your knowlege were certayn and trew, Ne mevyd ne made by falce suggestion; Ye wold nat then your doughter so blame and pursew, Seying that I erre in myne eleccion, Takyng no sad guydyng ne dyreccion, But lat my rafull ren at the hole chawnce, I was nat so folehasty, without deliberaunce, âFor I set nat my loue by fatall entent, Or of verrey hap as a comen vela[yn]; But with delyberacion and full auysement I yaue my loue to Gunstard, as to my souerayn, And trewly to name the verrey certayn, Where ye be to blame, fadyr, hyt semeth me To say that my loue was to euery man lyke fre. âAs to the gret repre[ff]e also by feynyng contryved, Whyche ye had when ye furst agayn me dyd obiect, Seying that my shyp of plesaunce was arryved In a port whyche was ignoble and despect, I mene, ye seyde that Gunstard was pore and deiect, Hauyng no part of nobylnes by lyneall dyscent, Whyche maketh my fawtes gret aftyr your iugement; âBut as in that ye folow the comon vnstabyll vulge, Ay lakkyng and blastyng, varyaunt as the wynd; By fame the flying messynger, whych publysshy[th] in devulge, Ther comen rude opynyons ignorant and blynd, [Seying it is a prouerbe sufficient and kinde:] âHe that ys nat born to habundance of good, But nedy for pouert, ys nat [of] gentyll blood.â âThys ys theyr folyssh reasons, dayly talkyng they erre, N[at think]yng how fortune by hyr vnstable centyr Plongeth estates gret downe from hyr whele full fer, When she lyst of daunger to swarve and repent hyr; But wold [they] well consyder the furst oryginall entyr Of oure comon byrth in oure begynnyng, Brought forth in to thys world poore, nakyd, and wepyng, âThen shold they remembre who were of noblenes, Who myght hym intytyll to the gentyll blood royall; They shuld se how nature with all her hole besynes Bryngeth forth hyr effectes in meruelous werkes all, Beyng in hys byrth to euery man equall; For as nakyd ys a kyng born, I vndyrstand, As ys the laborer that hath nedyr house ne land. âFurst when oure modyr Eue brought forth Abell and Caym, Who cowde prefer hymself of byrth or of lynage, And of theym tweyne infauntes, who cowde a tytyll claym In gentyll blood, in noblenes, or in hygh parage? That tyme was no dyfference betwyxt gentylman and page, But euery man was fayne to put hym in deuour Hys lyuyng for to gete with swetyng and gret labour. âOf all thys tyme was no man bound ne vndyr seruage, No man by seruyce vndyr subieccyon, Tyll when the pepyll gan to revell and rage, Guydyng theymsylf by wyll and nothyng by reson, Offendyng the lawe by theyr transgression, That of ryght and iustice they must be correct Of oon that was theyr souuerayn and they to hym subiect. âBut he that shuld be rewler and haue regency May nat of ryght be suche on as ys a transgressour; Agayn all dew ordyr [of nature] hyt ys, truly, That vyce shuld syt above and be a gouernour; But when that vertu, connyng, gentilnes, honour, He ys of ryght prouyd to be a souerayn, All though hys byrth be poore, thys ys the certayn. âOn thys wyse was Moyses and Gidion also, The noble Duke Iosue, by god hymsylf elect, And scrypture reherseth many mo, Whyche a[t] theyr byrth were pore and deiect, Yet were they for theyr vertu chosyn [to] direct And to gyde the pepyll; so, shortly, thys ys trew, That ther ys no gentylman but oonly by vertew. âThen, fadyr, take hede in all your houshold, Remembre well hys gentylnes in all hys gesture, The guydyng eke of Gunstard yef ye lyst behold, Hys lowly demenyng with all the behauyour, I trow ye woll afferme that Madam natur Hath grauntyd more to hym then to many of tho Whyche ye call gentyll men, all though they be nat so. âAnd truly I [neuer] herd make suche relacion In preysyng and lawde of Gunstard hys noblenesse, As I haue oftyn herd by youre owne assercion, Commendyng hys vertu and hys gentylnesse; Yet was the vertu more then was the fame dowtles, Syth ye sey that Gunstard ys no gentylmanâ Forsoth, ye sey vntrew and lytell good ye can. âYef ye had callyd hym pore, ye had nat gretly erryd, And yet, forsoth, to yow that ys a vylany To kepe a gentylman with yow vnpreferred, Syth he ys attendaunt in your seruice dayly; A gentylman suffyr[eth] nat hys man to be nedy, But though that nedy pouert take from a man ryches, Yet hyt bereveth hym nat nurture and gentylnes. âAs for your doutfull ambiguyte What iudyce ye shall yeue to me, or what sentence, Be nat thys in dowte nor in suche perplexyte. Yef he dy, I dy by cruell violence, For I was rote and cause of all the gret offence; Wherfore, yef ye wyll nat my deth accomplyssh, Myne owne cruell handes my lyfe shall sone fynyssh. âFor iustyce knoweth full well with hyr equall balance, Whyche ys ryghtfull iuge vnto euery wyght, My faute ys more then hys by iust preponderaunce; Why, then, shuld ye with a swerd nat sharply smyte, Syth that in my person ys only all the wyte? Reason wold that I shuld haue the correccyon, Whyche was the veray cause and chyef occasyon. âAnd yef hyt be yowre plesure to graunt at my request To chaunge hys mortall faut with mercyfull pardon, I geve yow for hys fynaunce the thyng that ye loue best, Myne own l[yf]e I mene, I geve yow that to guerdon; For, yef ye sle Gunstard, thys ys the conclusion, Let your cruell hastynes your doughtyr sle also, For, yef ye do hyt nat, mysylf I shall hit do.â Thys nobyll prynce hyr fadyr perseuyd ryght well Hyr chere nothyng abasshyd, hyr hert nat femynyne, Yet he thought she was nat so tygrous and cruell Hersylf to procure hyr own deth and mortall fyne; He thought her feruent hete of loue sh[u]l[d] sone declyne, Yef the fyre were nat ay kyndelyd new and new By the syght of Gunstard, chyef comfort of hyr vew. Wherfore Tancret, hys yre thenkyng to accomplyssh, Send forth hys men by nyght pryuyly To sle thys wofull Gunstard. O Tancret! thow mayst wyssh That Sysmond had neuer byn born, for thy noble glory, She ys darkyd sore and maculat by th[y] tyranny, Commaundyng the hert new blody in vyolent force Furyously to be rent out of the murdred corce. Tancret had closyd thys hert, bespreynt with blood all rownd, In a cowpe of gold in stede of sepulture, And by a messynger he send hit to Sismound, Whyche hath don hy[r] dylygence and also besy cure, Entendyng hyr owne cruell deth to procure; Of herbys and rotys to make [a] po[ty]on, Myxt in a lytell vyoll with venemous poyson. And the messynger sayd, shortly to expresse: âMadam,â he sayd, âmy lord your fadyr hath sent Thys wofull yeft, thys donatyf, vnto your noblenesse, The thyng ye louyd best he sent yow in present, Certyfying yow hyt ys hys hole intent To geve of Gunstard such ioy and comforture, As he gaue hym of Sismond, whyche was all hys plesure.â When thys lady sy thys hert shrynyd in gold, She vndyrstode anon hyr souuerayn was dede. Allas! now be the kalendes of deth peynfull and cold Enteryd and began, now can she no rede, Now ys she pale and wan, the floure of womanhede, That whylom was the myrrour of bewte and feyrenes, The oryent margaryte of nurture and gentylnes. Voyde of all comfort, she sat styll dysmayed, Tyll at the last with bold and herty corage, Beholdyng the messynger, thus to hym she sayd: âHyt were agayn reson to put yow in damage, Oonly for the doyng of your message; But, as for my fadyr, I geve yow in wetyng, Ye shall in my behalf bere hym no gretyng. âFor he resembleth more in hys furyous rage A tyraunt then a prynce, ay thursty for vengeaunce, Whyche cowth hys crewell pa[ssyo]n[s] attemp[re] ne aswage, Ne in all hys lyfe hymsylf cowde avaunce To so gret lawde and worshyp, as when hys puruyaunce Let hys hert be shrynyd in to a tombe of gold, And in thys oonly hys goodnes may be told.â And when she lust in talkyng to con[tune], Beholdyng the hert in wofull sepulture, She began hys exequyes with piteuous entune, Seying with feynt spyryt: âo ioyous mon[t]ure! Hostage of all lust, verrey port of plesure, Cursyd mut he be and waryed eternally, Whyche causeth that I se with my mortall ey! âHyt was ynough to me, and also most plesaunt, To behold with mynde and the lusty syght Of tru loue ay stedfast and nat variaunt; Hyt ys to moche to se the opyn in the lyght, Syth now the course ys don, thyn account ys quyte, Tyll Fortune hath complysshyd thy fate and mortall fyne, Buryed all in gold in stede of thy lybytyne. âI trow ther was no lak of thyng that shuld behove Vnto the dedly fate and seruyce funerall, Save oonly the tyrlyng teres of hyr that was thy love, For wepyng shuld euyr be at departyng mortall, Wherfore I trow my fadyr now at thy destiny fatall Hath sent the to my chambyr with a wofull chaunce That I shuld bewayle thy deth, performyng thyne obseruaunce. âAnd I shall fulfyll with my power and myght All thynges requysyte vnto thy mortuary, And aftyr all thys ys doon, the custom and the ryght, I shall geve mysylf to deth trybutary, Sewyng thy ferefull trace anon, I shall nat tary, But among othyr in dethys wofull daunce Folow next thy hand, as ys my fatall chaunce. âIn whos felyshyp, or in whos comytyve, Myght I better passe that peynfull iorney Than in hys whom I louyd most alyve? And also he taryeth for me, I dar well say, Wherfore, syth I was partener of hys plesaunce allwey, I shall also take part of hys dedly payne. Deth shall nat vs deseuyr, thys ys the sertayne.â And anon with that hyr chere began to turne, Hyr eyen ran on wepyng lyke shoures of rayne, Tyll she had wasshyn the hert, fyllyng the vrne With the styllyng water of hyr eyen twayne, And aftyr she had cesyd hyr wepyng, agayne Beholdyng the hert with a dedly chere, With sobbyng twyes she sayd, as ye shall aftyr here: âO ioyfull hert! O amyable amour! Now lacketh ther nothyng requyred of dewte Vnto the dedly fyne and funerall honour, Save oonly that I myght now folow the; But because hit semeth that deth dysdeyneth me, I shall therfor mysylf with vyolent force Dysseuyr my spyryt from hys wofull corce.â Allas! my wofull pen soroweth for to wryte Thys lamentable ende for thys tragedy. Who cowde without wepyng thys matyr endyte, To se so feyre a creature to dy so wrechydly, Of bewte feyrest and welle of curtesy? She toke, allas! the vyoll with the po[ty]on That she had made afore, and drank vp the poyson. Aftyr she had dronk that pestyferous draught, Hyrsylf opon the bed full carefully she layde, And deth without tareyng anon dyd hyr assaut, Grypyng her swollyn hert with many a greuous brayd; Mornyng she lay styll and neuer a word she sayd; Hyr spyrytes feyntyd sore and sore shortyd hyr breth, Whyche byn tokyns euydent and messyngers of deth. All hyr gentylwemen gretly they meruelyd Of hyr gret sorow and wofull complaynt; Yche askyd of other what theyr lady eylyd, And what the hert pretendyd with blood al bespraynt, There lying in a cowpe with watery teres draynt; So wofully they sorowyd syghyng with syghes depe, That truly hyt wold haue made any man to wepe. For they the aventure nothyng wyst ne knew, That was the cause of theyr sorow, but anon blyue They all wepyd for pyte and on hyr gan rew, Praying her gretly hyr spyrytes to reviue; But in the po[r]t of dyspeyr playnly to aryve She purposyd, so that with ioy ne with gladnes Ne cowde they hyr chere, so moche was hyr heuynes. Suche gentyll women as were most preuy With hyr askyd the cause of hyr dyssese, But she shonyd theyr speche and to theym gan say: âI pray yow, be pese, gretly ye me dysplese; Pardy, hyt lyth nat in yow to ease My sorow, for no ioy may me delyte, For of all thys world geve I nat a myte.â And euyr she sayd, with mornyng chere vnsessaunt: âO derworth, belouyd, swete hert! Honoure the I shall, whyle I am viuaunt, And when the soule out of my body ys stert, To the felyshyp of thyne hyt shall aduert; Where euyr hyt com, in woo or wele, I geve no force, so that hit may thyne sequele.â When all the ladyes and gentylwymen Ryght sorowfull sy hyr in thys vexacion, Conceuyd the sygnes of deth in hyr, ryght then They sent hyr fadyr worde of hyr trybulacion, Whyche that tyme walkyd in hys recreacion, And when hyt was told hym of thys vnhappy dede, He cam in gret hast, with hert heuy as lede. Hyt hapnyd euyn as the cruell venym Gan to sprede and in all veynes to [habounde], The prynce with pale, dedly chere cam in that same tyme, The whyche with hertly sorow was almost confounde; When he saw hys doughtyr, he fell to the grounde, Wepyng as a chylde, and wrang hys handes fast, So sore repentyng, that hym thought hys hert tobrast. Then spake he to hyr wordys meke and fayre, Saying, âgood Sismound, be of good chere, for and Yef ye morne thus, hyt wyll bryng yow to despeyre.â Thus he wenyd to haue esyd hyr of hyr band With hys comfort, but deth was at hand Crampysshyng hyr lymes, gon was hyr syght; Yet she answeryd hyr fadyr agayn as she myght, And seyd: âTancret, bestow bettyr, yef thow can, Thy teares, for they stond me in noon effect; Thow resemblest as he whyche slew the man, Aftyr repentyd, and hym bewept; Had hyt nat be bettyr for to haue kept Thy sorowfull doughtyr in ioy lyuyng, At hyr plesure secretly a man louyng, âThan to se by thy cruell execusion Hyr hard deth, to thyne endles langour, The whyche deth shalbe gyde and direccion, Yeuyng opyn knowlege of thys errour, The whyche was secret, but now by rumour Shall make the thynges that were hyd and vnknowyn Thorough all the world to be ouers[ow]yn.â And in so moche that Sismound myght no lengor speke, The throwes of deth no lengor wold delay, She holdyng the cowpe styll, hyr hert gan to breke, Yeldyng vp hyr spyryt for euer and ay; Ther was but âallas! allas!â and âwelaway!â Som wept, som cryed, and som fell in sowne, Hyt was a pyteous syght and a hydyous sowne. The wofull fadyr so [sory] in that stound, Seyng hys most ioy of the world agon, He made a gret shryke, fallyng to the ground, No more wordes spake, but ded as any ston; Thys was hyr sorow and mone opon mone, Wherfore hyt hath be spokyn fer agoo That an hasty creature wanteth neuyr wo. Vppon thys prynce thys may be veryfyed, [Whyche was] hasty [in] fury [haw]tayne, Without iugement slew the man aforsayd, Whos cruell deth hath hys doughtyr slayne; And of hyr deth he toke suche an endles payne, He dawyd neuyr good day aftyr, but was ded, And all the world wondred of hys folyhed. Ensample of thys euery wyse man take What hyt ys to be cruell in violence, And [of] a secret thyng a wondyr to make, Thorough hasty yre wantyng prouydence; Euery man remembre hys owne neglygence, And wyse in [to] vertu to plant a[nd] rote, For truly ayenst loue ther ys no bote. For certayn hyt ys of trew louers the gyse, When theyr trobyll and vexacion ys most sore, They wyll yche other loue in more herty wyse An hundred fold more then they dyd before; Youth wyll to youth, loue wyll to loue euermore; And, shortly, thys proces to conclude, Euerythyng wyll draw to hys simylytude, As betwene these louers hyt dyd appere, Whyche were both yong and in flowryng age, For theyr trobyll they louyd the better in fere, And passyd of deth the dredefull vyage. Allas! the lettyng of hyr mariage Was cause of thys myschyef, without fayle; Lo! what hyt ys to be agayn spousayle. Wherfore thys prynce standeth in gret perell, That to the l[aw] of wedlok wold nat inclyne, And as a tyraunt beyng ferse and fell, Causyng Gunstard to be put in to mortall fyne; Of whos soule yef that I shall determyne, I trust to god hys feythfull intencion Be the cause of hys endles saluacion. For why? he thought no harme to noon erthly wyght, At the request of Sismond he dyd consent; Natwithstandyng, I trust to god allmyght Hyt shalbe to her soule noon impedyment, For to haue be maryed hyt was theyr entent; Then ryken the sorow that she had withall, And the gret contricion of hyr ende fynall: That, as I trust, she ys in the blys celestyall, For of feyth and trouth all louers surmowntyng, She was a myrrour vnto wymen all, Ensample of trew and stedfast loue yeuyng, Wherfore I beseche hym that ys of all thyng Lord and gouernour and comfort ayenst all bale, Graunt these louers ioy and thus endeth my tale.
