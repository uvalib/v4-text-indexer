      <field name="fulltext">Epigrammi Satiron.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Septem compacta cicutis Fistula. Parturit, assiduo si non renovetur aratro, Non nisi cum spinis, gramina mundus ager. Epigrammisatiron.The attribution of this poem is questionable. From the Rhamnusian goddesse am I sent, On sinne t'inflict deserv√®d punnishment All-seeing sunne, lend me thy searching eye, That I may finde and scourge impietie, And pull from vice, which hath beguil√®d sence, Disguisd' like vertue, brasse facd' impudence. For now this age, this worse then iron age, This sincke of synne, this map of hell, this stage Of all vncleannesse, whose disease is ease, Wallowing in worlds of pleasure, swallowing seas Of sensuall delightes, is whollie growne A huge impostume of corruption, Whose swelling tumor (well I am assur'de) Must needs be launcd', or ne'er will be recurde: To the which act my genius prompteth me, Though it passe √Üsculapian surgerie. Be stout my heart, my hand be firm and steady, Strike, and strike home, the vaine worlds veine is ready; Let vlcerd limbes and gowtie humours quake, Whilst with my pen I doe incision make. Ad Rithmum.The attribution of this poem is questionable. March forth, and boldly march, my tel troth rimes, Disclose the lewdnesse of these looser times; Fear not the frowne of grim authority, Or stab of truth-abhorring villanie; Fear not the olde accustom√®d reward, A loathsome prison still for truth preparde; Though many hundred (Argus hundred) eyes, View, and review, each line, each word, as spies, Your meaning to entrap by wrong construction, Vndaunted speake the truth; let not detraction Apall your courage; spite of iniuries, Tell to the world her base enormities. A Ioue principium Mus√¶.The attribution of this poem is questionable. When first I did intend to write 'gainst sinne, My Muse was in suspence how to beginne; What crime to put i' th' forefront of my booke, Not through defect (let me not be mistooke) Of number, for the world abounds in vice, But 'cause 'twas somewhat hard to breake the ice To any; but at last methought 'twas fitt First to inveigh 'gainst those that doe committ The greatst offences; whom I tooke to be Our Ath[e]ists, which striue to roote vp the tree Of true religion: by these reasons movd:‚Äî First, that this sinne might be from vs remov'd; Without the which, it were in vaine to taxe Other offences, of what note or sexe Soever; next, because this kinde of men Doth most dishoner God; and lastly, when All that we are is his, from whom alone We doe all good deriue, when every one Moues by his power, lives by his permission, And can doe nothing if the prohibition Of the Almighty doe oppugne; it lies Only in him to end each enterprise. These things concurring, I my selfe did sitt To vse the inchoation of my witte First in his cause, by whose direction I hope to bring the rest vnto perfection. Satira 1. [AGAINST THE ATHEISTS, SABBATH-BREAKERS, ETC.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Regnat in humanis diuina potentia rebus, Non ex natur√¶ vi generatur homo. Quid deus, et cui fini animal ratione creatum Est pietas, est in relligione scelus. Atheos! forbear to speake such blasphemie! ‚ÄúThere is noe God,‚Äù O, damnd impiety! Yes, wicked villaine, thou shalt one day finde, With horror of a selfe-tormenting minde, A God, though long it be ere he begin, That can and will severely chastice sinne. Thou execrable monster, hatchd in hell, Brought by a crew of devills heer to dwell A plague one earth, why hast thou thus bewitcht With thy contagion mindes that are enricht With gifts of nature aboue common ranke? Who with the poyson that from thee they dranke Envenom'd, wound themselues, and others harme With strange opinions, which in heapes doe swarme From their ill-iudging thoughts; for heresie, Scisme, Puritanisme, Brownisme, pa[pi]strie, And such like hydra-headed errors, all Proceed from thee, thou art the principall; Thou which wilt never graunt a Diety, Vnlesse it be in poynt of pollicie, Which by religion dost not set a strawe, Devisde, thou thinkst, but to keep fooles in awe; Which makest a moncking-stock of hell and devill, Not in contempt of them, that they are evill, But 'cause thou vainly dost thyselfe perswade, Such toyes as these, such bugbears, were first made On purpose to fright children. Instantlie The soule thou thinkst doth with the bodie dye. Nature cannot immortalize a man, 'Tis true indeed, but heavenly powers can. ‚ÄúThat ther are no such things‚Äù (saist thou) ‚Äúthis age, This vicious age, confirmes; what need I wage Other contentious arguments, when I By this alone can proue noe Dietie? Were there a God, sinne would not flourish thus, Neither would vertue (as it is) by vs Be trodden vnder foote. For ought I see The lewdest persons thriue best, and are free From punnishment for sinne; besides all this, They that doe worship God doe often misse The blessings of the world &amp; suffer griefe; Yet ther is none can giue to them relief. They often fall in danger &amp; mischance, Yet never finde a full deliverance. Were there a God, sure then he would defend His children still, which wholly doe depend Vppon his mercy, &amp; vpon them spread His blessings in abundance: on the head Of the vngodly, there alon should fall His curses, crosses, punnishments; but all The righteous should escape.‚Äù Peace, impious elfe! All thou hast saide is clean against thy selfe. High Ioue permits the sunne to cast his beames, And the moyst cloudes to dropdowne plenteous streames, Alike vpon the just &amp; reprobate, Yet are not both subjected by one fate? The sunnes kinde heat, heavens fruitfull distillation, Shall be a cause of greater condemnation To the vngodlie; but vnto the just, (As gracious blessings which he doth entrust Vnto his children) they well vsd' shall be A cause of honour in eternity. Well may the wicked flourish in this world, But there will come a time they shall be hurld From top of all their pleasures eminence, And hell shalbe their place of residence. Then shall the righteous shine like glorious starres Within the sphear of heaven; oppressions, warres, Afflictions, persecutions, iniuries, Hatred, contempt, &amp; all calamities Shall be a crowne of honour to invest Their then trivmphant browes; eternall rest, Perpetuall joy, subject to no mischance, Shalbe their portion &amp; inheritance. But against him that makes negation Of principles in art, no disputation Is to be held: deny God, &amp; his Word Can smale impression make; it is the sword Of iustice which must bring thee to confesse The powerfull Godhead; yet I'le somewhat presse Thy irreligeous minde. Of thy creation Take but a true consideration; For 'tis not Nature, as thou dost surmise, That begets man in soule &amp; qualities. For thou must know, two parts must first conjoyne Before we can a perfect man define; The soule, an essence intellectuall, The body, a substance corporeall; The first we immediatly receiue From Iove; the other God to man doth leaue (As a subordinat instrument) To generat; 'tis onlie incident To man, to cause the bodies procreation; The soule's infusde by heavenly operation. Looke on this with an intellectuall eye, And it will teach thee ther 's a Diety. View but the earth, which doth each year renew Her drouping beauty, &amp; clean change her hiew Vpon the Springs approch; doth it not shew A supream Power, that governs things belowe? Looke on the heavens (which thou shalt ne're ascend, Vnlesse it be with horrour to attend Thie sentence of damnation;) looke, I say, Doth not their goodly opifice display A power 'bove Nature? Dull conceited foole, Ne'er train√®d vp but in dame Natures schoole, Looke in thy selfe, when thou commitst a sinne, Doth not thy conscience prick thy soule within? If that ther be no God, what dost thou fear? Why doth remorse of conscience, or dispaire, Afflict thee thus? This is enough to prove (Were there no more) an Elohim, a Iove. How canst thou then thus impiously deny The sacred essence of the Diety? Recant this errour, least, to all mens wonder, Revengefull Iove doe strike thee dead with thunder. Being once granted (this our true position) Ther is a God; let 's now make inquisition What this God is; which must be by relation Vnto his workes, or else by meer negation Of what he is not, we may make collection Of what he is. It is the times infection [To b]e to curious in the mistery Of searching his essentialitie, Which simplie, as too glorious for the eye Of mortall vnderstanding to descrie, We cannot comprehend; let 's therfore know him In that sort onlie that the Scriptures shew him. God is an Essence intellectuall, A perfect Substance incorporeall; A Spirit whose being ne're begining knew, Omnipotent, omniscient, ever true; Or rather, in the abstract:‚ÄîMajestie, Truth, mercy, wisdome, power, iustice, glorie; Which out of nothing this great world did frame, And into nothing will rechange the same; Which made that glorious eye of heaven, the sunne To rule the day, and for darke night the moone; Which joynes in friendly league each element, And keeps the sea within his continent; Which of the dust mans body did create, Into the which a soule he did translate, Like his owne image pure; vntill mans fall, Left to his owne free-will, polluted all That goodly microcosme; for the which deed, Had not the issue of the promisde seed, The valiant Lion of stout Iudahs tribe, The gentle Lambe vngentlie crucified, Redeemd his life, borne his iniquity, And conquerd Satan &amp; his tyrannie, He should haue been severely punnish√®d And everlastingly haue perish√®d. But now by him, all that make oblation Of a true faith, assure their soules salvation; What the first Adam did by sinne destroy, The Second hath restorde with duble ioye. But leaving this moste heavenly meditation, Let 's shew for what effect was mans creation: It was, it is, to serve this God alone, With honour, loue, &amp; true devotion. The manner how were somewhat long to write, The Scripture all his precepts doth recite. Which, cause we cannot in all parts fulfill, In liew of power he doth except our will. But man, vngratefull man, this God withstandes, And, like Briareus with his hundred handes, Strives, as it were, to pull him from his throne Which gave him being, &amp; through whom alone He his well-being has. O, impious deed, Which to recount my very heart doth bleed! That wee (like to those giants, which made warre Against the heavens) with such presumption dare Lift vp our selues against our Maker by So many kinde of damnd impietie, So many hellish sinnes, whose hideous cry Percing the clowdes, mounting aboue the skie, Affront Gods power, &amp; doe deserve to finde Another Deluge to destroy mankinde. But God, this gracious God, with mercie strives To bring vs to him &amp; to saue our lives; And therfore hath chalkd out a ready way, (That we no more might goe so farre astray) His Gospell; which path (if not trod amisse) Will safelie bring vs to celestiall blisse. This profferd grace some see not, some despise, Although herein alone their safetie lies. Omitting Iewish superstition With soule-profaning Turkish Alcheron, And Infidels, which noe religion vse, Whose ignorance cannot their sinne excuse: We that doe boast of Christianity, And knowledge in Gods holie misterie, With sects &amp; scismes our religion Have made a chaos of confusion. Our Anabaptists I will set aside, With Families of Love, whose aimes are wide From the true faith. There is a trinall kinde Of seeming good religion, yet I finde But one to be embrac'd, which must be drawne From Papist, Protestant, or Puritane. And first to speake of that pure seeming sect, Which now of late beginneth to infect The body of our land:‚ÄîThis kinde of men Is strangelie (for I know not how nor when) Become so populous, that with the number, But more with new devises, it doth cumber Our Catholique Church, &amp; sticks as a disease Within her bowels; whilst it seems to please With fain√®d habite of true holinesse Which is indeed the worst of wickednesse. The thought of this hath set my Muse one fire, And I must rage e're I can swage mine ire. You hypocriticall precisians, By vulgar phrase entitled Puritanes, Which make of superficiall sanctitie A cloke, to hide your inbred villanie; You soules-seducers vnto worst of evils, You seeming saints &amp; yet incarnat devils, How dare ye slander our religion, And make a scoffe at our devotion? How dare you with opprobrious wordes revile, Or with vnhallowed actions thus defile The sacred orders which our Church doth hold, And sanctimonious customes, which of olde Haue by grave counsels, to a godlie end, Not superstition, as you doe pretend, Been instituted? Cease your open wrongs! Cannot our Bishops scape your slanderous tongues? No: you maligne their great authoritie, Because they doe search out your villanie. You must haue private meetings! To what end? In bellie-cheer and lust your time to spend. O rare devotion &amp; strange holinesse, Which endes in soule polluting beastlinesse! Well may you blinde the eyes of common sence, And passe for men of zeale &amp; confidence 'Mongst simple worldlings, which by outward shew Doth iudge the inward man; but God doth know All your intents, &amp; with severity Will castigate your damnd hypocrisie. In the mean time may you be forcd to dwell At Amsterdam, or else sent quicke to hell. For now my Muse doth hear another motion;‚Äî ‚ÄúIgnorance is the mother of devotion!‚Äù Erroneous papist, hast soe litle grace? Thou knowst 'tis false, then how, or with what face Canst thou maintaine against thy conscience So manyfest an errour without sence? For how can he be good that knowes no cause Whie he is good, but like a milhorse drawes, Blindfolded, in a circle? Yet you teach (For to the learn√®d I addresse my speech) Religion in an vnknowne tongue to those Whom we call common people; I suppose, Nay trulie may averre, you doe conceale Your misteries, not daring them reveale, Lest that the people, knowing them for lies, Should contemne you &amp; hate your heresies: You that are worse then cannibals by oddes, For they devoure but men, you eat the gods! From whom doe you assume authoritie To pardon capitall iniquity? Why, not from God, the Pope 's sufficient To pardon sinne &amp; divert punnishment. Who taught you soe, you wilfully blinde fooles? Sure Satan read this lecture in his schooles. Wher did you learne? (was't in the Devils booke? For from Gods word I 'me sure you never tooke Such damnable positions) that to murder A prince, which doth not your religion furder, Is a moste lawfull act, yea commendable, For which you will at any time enable That man with your best benediction, And all his sinnes free absolution, And warrantize him heaven &amp; happie day: (‚ÄúA warrant seald with butter!‚Äù as we say). All this, &amp; more then this, you will performe, Be 't to the meanest abject, basest worme, That dares attempt soe horrible a deed. And though his enterprise doe not succeed, (As God forbid it should) but he doe die For his lewd treason, he shall instantlie Be canonizd a Saint. Ravilliacke Doth neither Saints nor Martires title lacke. But you had reason: his vnhappy hand Destroyde a kinge, &amp; almost brought a land To vtter ruin; for being thus defilde With her owne princes blood, a tender childe Was to succeed, &amp; we know Scriptures say, ‚ÄúWoe to those landes whose scepters children sway.‚Äù But Faux &amp; his confederats are enrolde For blessed Saints among you.‚ÄîWho will holde Your piety authenticall, which makes Such hell-houndes Saints? What godly heart not quakes To hear such mischiefe, to record such evill, As they would haue committed? The grand Devill Was their instructer sure, else could they not Haue once devisde soe damnable a plott, As by one blast our king to ruinat, And our whole kingdome to depopulate, And spoile of her best treasure. But high Iove, Against whose power in vaine their forces strove, Crost their designes, &amp; with a mighty arme Delivered vs from the pernicious harme Of that moste eminent danger; to whose Name All praise &amp; all thanksgiving for the same We doe ascribe; beseching him to blesse Our realme from you &amp; your accomplices. But to proceed: no man may kill his prince Although a tyrant; which I could evince By arguments drawne from the word of God, But I too long one this haue made abode. Besides your errour I soe plaine repute, As needs noe disputation to confute, There are more errours of especiall note, Which, if I list recite, I heer could cote; But I doe leave them for the learned pen Of great divines and more iudicious men. Your holy water, purgatorie, bulles, Wherwith you make the common people gulles, Are grosse abuses of phantastique braines Subtillie devisd'e only for private gaines, Which you pull from the simple as you list, Keeping them blinded in black errours mist; And from the truth doe lead them clean astray, Whilst of their substance you doe make your prey. You false impostors of blinde ignorance, Think you to 'scape eternall vengeance? 'Tis not your Popes fond dispensation, Your workes of supererrogation, Your idle crossings, or your wearing haire Next to your skin, or all your whipping-cheer, Your praiers &amp; pilgrimage to Saints, your pixes, Your holy reliques, beads, &amp; crucifixes, Your masses, Ave Maries, images, Dirges, &amp; such like idle fantasies Of superstitiously polluted Rome, Can saue your soules in that great day of doome. Between these sects, as in a golden meane, Stands the religion whervnto we leane; Vndoubted truth it is that we doe holde, Yet is our zeale so frozen &amp; so colde, So chockt with thornes of covetous desire, So hoggishlie polluted with the mire Of carnall lusts, that our best sanctity Is but a kinde of bastard piety. And yet the times as now did ne're afford Such plenty of dispencers of Gods word; For now the Gospell, like the midday sunne, Displaies his beames over all Albion. But we, as if by too much light strucke blinde, Neglect this meanes of grace, which is assignd For our soules health. Some out of pride contemne it, Others, bent vnto greedy gaine, condemne it, Because it speakes against the slavish vice Of soule-bewitching, sordid avarice. Others, that follow Epicureus fashion, Cannot abide to hear of reformation, And therfore hate the Gospell, which doth cry Against their brutish sensuality. Many there are which live like libertines, And the holy C[h]urch &amp; good devines Doe hold ridiculous;‚Äîtheir homely homes Will serve them well enough to pray, when 't comes Into their fancies; they cannot abide Vnto Church orders strictlie to be tide. Others, forsooth, will haue a congregation, But that must be after another fashion Then our Church doth allow,‚Äîno church at all,‚Äî For that they say is too papisticall; Like their profession, they themselves will sever From stone walles;‚Äîtut, their church shall last for ever; Theire soules shalbe their tabernacles still, That kinde of church doth only please their will. Iove separat me from these Separists, Which think they hold heavens kingdome in their fists, And yet their life, if we into it prie, Is full of sinne &amp; damnd impiety. Some, more for fear of the lawes punnishment Then zeale vnto devotion, doe frequent Gods holy temple, where they doe imploy Themselves as ill as if they staide away; On[e] part in sleeping, in discourse another; A third doth seeme to marke, but doth discover Slilie some object that withdrawes his eye From what he should attend; the yoonger frie Come only to be seen &amp; see: of all Which doe repaire to church, the fruit is smale That is collected by them. I surmise That wickednesse by this doth rather rise To greater height, then anywise decaie; For pride &amp; lust it is the ready way I'me sure. Of every new framd fashion, This is the place to make moste ostentation, To shew the bravery of our gay attire Hether to come on purpose; our desire Is to be seen of all, whilst we observe The like in others. Though our soules doe sterve For want of knowledge, we doe litle care; From gazing vp and downe we cannot spare A iot of time to hearken to Gods word, When all's to litle that we doe afforde To our owne fancies; thus the time we spend, Which devine service soone brings to an end; And then againe we homeward doe advaunce, Fuller of pride, as full of ignorance. Is there a wench whose beauty is of note? Hether your gallants come, only to cote Her rare perfections; yea, this sacred place Serves them to make (they have soe litle grace) Compacts for lust. Thus by these hellish evils The howse of God is made a den of devils. I speake not this to hinder the concourse Of well affected mindes vnto that source, That fountaine, blessed fountaine, which doth flow With living waters, Gods word; no, my bow Aimes at another marke; I onlie strive To rectifie abuses which deprive The Gospell of his propagation, And plentifull encrease. Our nation Rather needs spurres to quicken his slow pace Vnto religion &amp; the house of grace. For some there are which gape soe after gaine, That on the Lords day they will not refraine, So 't to their benefit tend, to exercise Themselves in some laborious enterprise. In towne &amp; cuntrie this vngodlie sinne To grow vnto a custome doth beginne; Your country swaines will moste familiarlie Worke one this day &amp; labour impiouslie. But 'mongst our tradesmen specially, this vse, Which I may iustlie call a damnd abuse, Is most familiar. Six dayes in the weeke Are not sufficient, but the seventh must reeke With sweat of their vngodly labour, when They should repaire to church with other men, To give vnto the Lord, the only Giver Of blessings, &amp; the gracious Forgiver Of hell deserving sinnes, all praiers &amp; praise. What though the word of God expresly sayes, ‚ÄúThis is the day which thou must dedicate Vnto my service, this day at no rate Shalt thou performe thy worke, least thou doe draw My heavy wrath vpon thee?‚Äù Though the law Of man forbid the same, and doe inflict A punnishment on those it doth convict Of this offence; yet fearlesse of all danger, From the man borne i' th' land vnto the stranger, If they can cast a mist before the eye Of sinne-correcting, strict authority, Moste of our tradesmen will enact this crime; It stands not with their profit to loose time; They'l take their best advantage while they may; It is sufficient once a month to pray. Vngracious villaines, how can you expect A blessing to your labour, which neglect The only meanes, Gods service, which alone Can bring your workes vnto perfection? The manna gathered in the wildernesse By the Iewes vnbeelieving wickednesse Vpon their Sabboth, by the Lord forbidden, Both putrifide &amp; stuncke. Nothing is hidden Which shall not be reveald; though you may blinde The eyes of man, there is a God will finde And punnish this lewd sinne. I' th' meantime think That all such labours in his nostrils stinke, And therfore shall prove fruitlesse: men intend But God it is that consummates the end. I cannot 'scape the blest Communion, Which doth with God effect our vnion, It is soe much abusd by sinfull man,‚Äî To passe the papist &amp; the Lutheran, Their trans &amp; consubstantiation, Of both these errors to make no relation,‚Äî We that doe holde the verity indeed, That this same bred, wheron our soules doe feed, This wine we drink, is reall bred and wine, Although the mistery be moste devine; Even we, I say, though we doe represent The true opinion of the Sacrament, Yet in the vse doe erre, nay rather sinne, Which applide rightly is the meanes to winne Eternall life. Some men, which are vnable To iudge the worth, come to this Holy Table Only to please their sence; others there are Which for so smale a pittaunce doe not care;‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat is a bitte of bread, a sip of wine?‚Äù‚Äî But that the law doth straightly them enioyne, To be partakers of this holy meat And sacred drink. By farre they'd rather eat At their owne howses, wher their carnall sence May be suffic'd; their soules intelligence May sterve for want of this spirituall food, And they regard it not. That's only good In their grosse braines, whose visibility And appetituall sensibility Lies open to their sence. Others ther be, Which doe indeed esteem more reverendlie Of the Lords Supper; &amp; because they knowe The danger great, that to their soules may grow By their vnworthy eating, quite refuse To be partakers of it; still they vse Some let or other to detaine them back; Either they doe due preparation lacke, Or else they are not in true charity With other men. Ther must noe malice be In a communicant: 'tis true.‚ÄîWhat then? Doe you surmise, O shallow-pated men, That this excuse is all sufficient To satisfie for such a foule intent? No, simple worldlings; the king made his feast, And you were bidden to it 'mongst the rest; But 'cause you would not come, you shall not tast His sacred supper, but you shalbe cast Into that pitt, with the ungodlie rout, Where the worme dies not, the fire ne're goes out. And soe shall likewise he that boldlie came Without his wedding roabe; I mean the same Which comes vnto the Table of the Lord As to some common, ordinarie bord, And never seekes to make true preparation, But even eats &amp; drinkes his owne damnation. It is a lamentable thing to see The ignorance &amp; strange stupidity Of men now living in the clearest light Of the resplendant Gospell, as if night Of darkest errour still ecclips'd their eyes; They are so rude in the true misteries Of their salvation, scarce one man 'mong ten Can giue a true account of 's faith; nor, when He comes to due examination, How he hath made his preparation For the Lords Table, iustlie tell the number Of Sacraments; this only thing doth cumber The wits of many &amp; confounds their sence, As I haue seen by plaine experience. How far then are they from the perfect knowing Of their true vse! yet these men will be shewing Themselues moste forward to receive; but what They know not, nor they care not much for that; But for the world, to purchase earthly gaine, They follow that with dayly sweat and paine. It is a custome, lewd enough I 'me sure, (And I doe wonder that our lawes endure Such profane vses) after the receate Of that c≈ìlestiall sacramentall meat, For olde &amp; young i' th' country frequently Vpon that day to vse most luxurie. Each on[e] must then vnto an alehouse run, Drink drunk, act any sinne vnder the sunne. Why? this same day's a day of iubile; It hath been an accustomd liberty To spend this day in mirth, and th[e]y will choose Rather their soules then priviledges loose. And soe (I fear) not few among them will; For they, which on this day doe drink &amp; swill In such lewd fashion, may be likened well To him that swept the howse wher he did dwell, And made it clean, &amp; garnisht it full faire; After which act ther did to him repaire Seven evill fiends worse then the former were; More ougly sinnes did enter &amp; dwell there, And by his falling to more wicked sinning, He made his end far worse then his begining. So is 't with them that in this sort doe sinne, Satan stands close ready to enter in, Even as he did in Iudas, which had eat Vnworthily the sacramentall meat. And yet fond man regardeth not one whit, Till he have made himselfe the devils bit, Who at two bits, for so his name imports, Devours both soule &amp; body, mans two parts. Thus is man blowne, by every puffe of vanity, From the true scope of Christianity, His soules salvation. Wretched, wicked man, Returne, repent! Thy life is but a spanne, A breath, a buble; think that thou must die To live in joyes or endlesse miserie. And if the comfort of celestiall blisse, Whose joy beyond imagination is, Haue not sufficient power to mollifie Thy heart, heart hardned in iniquity, Yet let the horrour of damnation, Of whose strange paines no tongue can make relation, Enforce repentance with a true contrition, And that produce a forward disposition To a new course of life; refuse not grace While it is offered; while ther 's time &amp; space Dally not with repentance, least iust Iove Convert to furie his contemn√®d love; And in that ire, iustly conceiv√®d ire, Confine thy soule to hells tormenting fire. Satira 2. [AGAINST SHAMS.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Fronti nulla fides, ludunt spectacula mentem; Non facies verum symptoma cordis habet. Decipimur specie recti, sub imagine veri Falsa latent; virtus dissimulata placet. The brave erect Mausolian monument, That famous vrne, the worlds seventh wonderment, Whose sumptuous cost &amp; curious workemanship Noe poet, though in Helicon he dip His pen, by verse is able to dilate, Being made for wonder, not to imitate; For all his glorious outside, without staine, Filth &amp; corruption doth within containe. The sunne, whose spacious orbe in magnitude Doth far exceed the earth, seemes to the rude, Ignorant of the astronomicke art, Noe bigger then the wheel of Hobnols cart. Counterfet gold, if we doe trust our eye, Will passe for purest mettall currantlie. The dredfull beast, yclep√®d crocodile, Whose dwelling is about √Ügiptian Nile, Before he doth devoure his wish√®d prey, Pitty in outward semblance doth display; For brinish teares from his false eyes distill, When he is ready to destroy &amp; kill. Full dear seafaring passengers abie The Syrens sweet enchaunting melodie, Which by their singing evermore presage Death thretning danger by the furious rage Of an ensuing storme. Of Circes cup Who hath not heard, that who therof did sup Was changd (strange metamorphosis in nature) From humane forme into a brutish creature? And yet the cup [w]as goodly to beholde, Richly enchasde with pearle, composde of golde. Glorious in view appeard Medusaes head, Nathlesse it did strike the beholders dead. Serpents &amp; poysnous toads, as in their bowers, Doe closely lurke vnder the sweetest flowers. But sencelesse things &amp; sensuall beastes alone Mislead not mans to rash opinion; Even rationall creatures doe our iudgements cheat, Man is to man a subject of deceite; And that olde saying is vntrue, ‚Äúthe face Is index of the heart.‚Äù False looking glasse To view the thoughts of man, when there doe raine Stormes of displeasure in mans vex√®d braine; When mists of sorrow reasons eyes doe blinde, When revenge thunders in his ragefull minde, His face can carry sunneshine of delight, Allthough his soule be blacke as ougly night. You erre, fond physiognomers, that hold The inward minde followes the outward molde. Philosophers, your axiome is vnsure, The soule is as the bodies temperature; Complexion noe certaine ground doth shew The disposition of a man to know; Els why should Nisus, that same pretty youth, Be of soe lewd behaviour? when, in truth, His bodies crasis is angelicall, And his soules actions diabolicall. Things are not as they seeme; for were they soe, Detraction would professe himselfe my foe, Shewing his rancors hate before my face, And not behinde my backe worke my disgrace, When in my presence he doth seem to be As Damon to his Pithias, friend to me. Mechanico, reputed by moste men An honest tradesman &amp; grave citisen, When thou dost come into his shop to buy, Although it be the least commodity, With kind salutes &amp; good wordes will receave thee; But trust him not, in 's deeds he will deceave thee. Madam Fucata seemeth wondrous faire, And yet her face is painted, &amp; her haire, That seemes soe goodly, a false periwig. Thus all her beauty is not worth a fig, That doth appeare so glorious to the eye, And strikes my gallant in loves lethurgie, That soe doth boast of famous ancestry And from great Iove derives his pedigree, And speakes indeed, like Iove himselfe, in thunder; For othes, as if they would rend heaven in sunder, Shot out in vollies, like artillerie, Flie from his mouth, that piece of blasphemie. Like some great horse he paceth vp and downe, Gracing his lookes with a disdainefull frowne, And takes vpon him in each company, As if he held some petty monarchy. If any man by chance discourse of warre, He being present this discourse will marre By intermixing his high martiall deeds, Swearing his manhood all mens else exceeds; Vowing that his Herculean arme hath slaine More men then populous London doth containe, Except the subvrbs. He hath made to flie The potent Turke, &amp; got the victory By his owne valour. Charles the Fift of Spaine Was nothing to him, nor great Tamburlaine; Stout Scanderbeg a childe; he paralels Strong sinnewed Sampson, or, indeed, excels. What dares he not performe? Hee 'l vndertake To make the Spanniards vtterly forsake The Westerne Indies &amp; their mines of gold, With some few chosen men; nay hee 'l vpholde His force sufficient to reconquer Fraunce, And with that kingdome once againe enhaunce The faire revennewes of the English crowne, Or lay their citties levell with the ground. Hee 'l chase the Turke out of Hungaria, And force him leave his seat in Grecia; Europe hee 'l free from his vexation, And bring againe that scattered nation, The Iewes, together to their Palestine, Which he by force will conquer, &amp; confine To his obeisaunce. These he dares be bolde, And more then these, even acts that would make colde The heartes of men only to hear recounted, His martiall force, which Mars his force surmounted, Shall vndertake. Thou vainly bragging foole, Ne're train√®d vp in brave Bellonaes schoole, Doe not I know, for all thou lookest soe big, Thou never yet durst see a sillie pig Stucke to the heart? A frog would make thee run! Thou kill a man? No, no! thy mothers sonne, Her only sonne, was a true coward bred. I 'le vndertake a sword shall strike thee dead, And never touch thee! As for thy discent, Though thou maist boast the place was firtill Kent That gave thee birth, yet was thy syre a clowne, And kept his wife in a course homespun gowne; Who, scraping vp a litle wealth, began To fashion thee an ill shapd gentleman. And now, because thou hast, like Coriate, Traveld a litle ground, &amp; canst relate How many baudy houses thou hast seen In the French country; how the whores have been Kinder there to thee then our English punckes; How many nunnes thou hast heard sing, &amp; monckes Say mattens; thou thyselfe dost now repute The wort[h]iest wort[h]y of the race of Brute; The rarest linguist England doth afford, The bravest soldier that e're wore a sworde. Vain vpstart braggadochio! heartlesse cow! Leave Mars his drumme, goe holde thy fathers plow! Fine Mistris Simula, the Puritane, Which as the plague shunnes all that are profane, Ready to faint if she an oth but hear, For all her outward holinesse doth blear The worldes dimme eyes, plaies but the hypocrite, Living in sinne &amp; sensuall delight. For, would you think it? she was tane in bed With a young, tender, smoothfacd Ganimed, Her husbands prentice. Out, lascivious whore! Thy countries shame, thy husbands festered sore! Are these the fruits thy frequentation Of learned sermons yeilds? Is this the fashion Of your pure seeming sect? Your meetings tend Surely vnto some such like holy ende. And yet the world, blinde world, thinkes you to be Men of most zeale &amp; best integrity. Methinkes I see the rich chuffe, Sordido, How basely in apparrell he doth goe; Vpon his head a thrice turnd greasy felt, His hose &amp; dublet a tuffe ramskin pelt; His stockings of the coursest woole yspunne, Full of broad patches, with thicke hobnaild shoone; His lockram bande sewde to his hempen shirt; A lethern thong doth serve his wast to girt, At which a pouch full 20 winters olde Hangs for his codpiece to keep out the colde. How hunger-starvd he lookes! With thin lank cheekes, With beard vnkemd, with face fit soile for leekes, I dare be sworne, who e'er should see the goat, Would iudge him to be scarcely worth a groat. And yet this boore, this miserable swine, Hath landes &amp; lordships, with good store of coine. Slave to thy wealth, thus from thy selfe to rend What thy next heir will soone as vainly spend! Scotus, thou hast deceiud the world enough, Which takes thee, clothd in thy embrodered stuffe, To be some lord at least. Poore silly groome, Which tother day wouldst faine have had the roome Of some base trencher-scraper, so to put Scraps twice runne over, in thy half starvd gutt. And now, with often filling of the pot, An office vnder my lords man hast got, Being some bread-chipper or greasy cooke, For much observance &amp; respect dost looke. Goe where thou wilt, thou gettest none of me. I know too well thy genealogie. Let ignorant asses bend their supple knees, And cry, ‚ÄúGod blesse your worship,‚Äù for some fees Of thy cast office; I as much doe scorne, As they desire the plenty of thy horne. Proud meacocke, make the world no more believe Gentility is pind vpon thy sleeve; For if thou doe, with my satirick verse, Thy parentage &amp; manners I 'le reherse, And make the world, for thy monstrous othes, To laugh &amp; hisse thee out of thy fine clothes. He that sees Moros in his brave attire Would deem him to be some discreet esquire, He speakes soe seldome, soe demure doth looke. But see how much a man may be mistooke;‚Äî A verier foole dame Nature never bred, That scarce knowes chalke from cheese, or blew from red; Yet amongst many which haue purblinde eyes This foolish sot hath been thought wondrous wise. I know a fellow (I 'le conceale his name) Hath purchasd, &amp; yet doth possess, the fame Of a rare scholler, that hath noe one part Of learning, not the smallest dramme of art. And will you know how he got his repute? I 'le tell you, soe you 'l promise to be mute And make no wordes on 't. 'Tis his asses guise, As soone as he from 's morning bed doth rise, After some turne or two in Paules, to drop In the precinct of some knowne stationers shop, And there, like a learnd Sir, with a grave voice He doth demand to see some special choice Of famous authors, whose true names by heart The foole hath gotten, of what tongue or art It skills not much; French, Latine, Hebrew, Greeke, All 's one, he vnderstandeth all alike: Montaignes Essaies in French, the history Of Philip Comineus, poesie Of Virgil, Horace, &amp; such Latin writers, St. Austine, Bernard, or some new enditers Of commentaries theologicall; And sometimes he 's for philosophicall, And the best writers of astronomie, With phisick, logicke, &amp; geometrie. Then Aristotle, Di[o]scorides, Avicen, Galen, &amp; Hypocrates; The Hebrew Rabbins, Ptolomeus, Plato (Although the foole did never learne his Cato), Are in his mouth familiar. Some of these, Which to demaund his fancy best doth please, He for some hower or two will pore vpon, Which time is worth your observation; For sometime smiling with a simpring grace, In turning over those same leaves apace, To shew his skill i' th' tongues, hee 'l nod his head, As if the place which he doth seeme to read Mov'd him to laughter; then with thumb hee 'l cote, As if that sentence were of speciall note, And straight cry ‚Äúpish!‚Äù as if he dislikd that Which he as much knowes as his grandams cat. Well, having (as he thinkes) sufficiently Guld the opinion of the standers by To his desire, the booke he downe doth lay, Demaunds the price, dislikes it, goes his way. Somtime perhaps, to blinde dull iudgements eye, Some petty English pamphlet he will buie. Thus hath this gull, among the common sort, Which iudge by outward shewes, got the report Of a great scholler, when, God knowes, the foole Was never farther then the grammer schoole. Thus mans opinion doth him oft deceave, And of true iudgement doth his minde bereave. Iudging by outward shewes we iudge amisse, For vice in vertues habite clothed is. Hypocrisie seemes holinesse in looke, Fixing his eyes on heaven or in his booke. O, 'tis a most dissembling, harmfull devill, That's good in shew &amp; yet in heart is evill. Backbiting slander, deep dissimulation, Are inside hate, yet outside salutation. Vanting in wordes true valour oft doth seeme, Yet by his actions we him coward deem; Soothing vp ill, pernicious flattery, In outward shew good counsel seemes to be. Deformity, daubde with a face of paint, With beauties title doth herselfe a[c]quaint; Base avarice &amp; sordid parsimony Is thrift accounted, &amp; good husbandry; Excessive spending, sensuall prodigality, Is thought all one with liberality; Impudent boldnesse, rash temerity, Is held for vertuous audacity; Ignorance in his scarlet robe yclad, Accounted learning, in respect is had, When vertuous art, clothed in poor aray, Is held in no repute, till time bewray The seeming good that ignorance hath not, And the not seeming good that art hath got. Thus ther's no trust to be reposde in seeming, Since virtue's knowne by act, not by esteeming. Sat[ira] 3. [AGAINST PRIDE, ETC.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Dum tendit superos ambire superbia c≈ìlos, Decidit ad Stigium fulmine quassa lacum. √Üterno verum sic indignata perisse, C≈ìcos mortales ad sua regna trahit. After the fabricke of heaven, earth, &amp; seas Were gloriously composde, it then did please High Iove (e're he began mans operation) To give vnto the Angels their creation. No earthy substance was in them at all, Their formes were heavenly &amp; spirituall. Yet some of these, vpon the very day They were by God created (if I say Vntruth, I can alleadge mine author for it), Swelling with pride (oh, I to write abhor it) Because they were such glorious creatures, strove To take possession of the throne of Iove. But he, displeasde with such ambition, Struck them with lightning downe to Acheron, And them confined perpetually to dwell In the darke horrour of infernall hell. Thus were faire angels ougly devils made, And one dayes sinne an everlasting trade. After the fall of these was man compacted, And from him sleeping woman was extracted And made to be a kinde associat Vnto him. Now the devill shewes his hate And swelling envie 'gainst God in his creature Formd to his image, man; to make defeature Of his estate in blisse, he doth intend And fittest opportunity attend. To worke this feat proud Lucifer's enioynd, And goe[s] about it swifter then the winde. ‚ÄúShall I,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúfall from celestiall blisse Into the horrour of hells blacke abysse, And man escape? Shall I in torment live, And man in pleasure? Shall I only grieve, And man goe scotfree? No, 'twill ease my paine If in my griefe I him copartner gaine; And I will doe it: if my plots hit right, I 'le bring his soule vnto perpetuall night.‚Äù This saide, the serpents shape he takes &amp; hies Vnto the tree in midst of Paradise. There findes the woman, after nam√®d Eve, The weakest vessell, easiest to deceave; Whose minde with hellish pride he straight inspirde That she [the] trees forbidden fruit desirde; The tree of which alone she might not eat, The tree forbidden by the Lord for meat. The tree of knowledge, knowledge of much evill, She gathers straight, seduc√®d by the devill, Which greedilie, without advice, she tasted, And then to give her husband of it hasted. Whom when she had allurde vnto her will, And both had tasted, then they knew their ill; But all too late (first Phrigians) they grew wise, Being both thrust forth Edens Paradise; Which happy place man ever had possessed, If they had never in this sorte transgressed. Vnhappy three, first causers of our evill, Fond man, proude woman, &amp; accurs√®d devill! Since this hath pride increasd with Adams seed, And Lucifer companions shall not need; Man with soe many kindes of pride doth swell As if he strove headlong to run to hell. Some shew their pride in raysing stately bowers, Which seem to threatne heaven like Babell towers; Building so strong, erecting them so high, As if they ment to live eternally, In spite of Iove. Others bestow more cost In houses built for pleasure, which they boast Are but for shew, then would maintaine &amp; cherish Thousands of poore soules which are like to perish: Confusion sure will light on their pretence Which wast their treasure in soe vaine expence. Others there be which, clad in gay attire, In stately gate &amp; loftie lookes, aspire Above their ranke; holding inferiors base, Scarsely permitting equalles come in place Of fellowship, vnlesse their peacock sutes Gaine them admittance in their proud reputes. O, these are men of admiration, Which follow each fantastique fashion, To be observde with reverence &amp; respect; When, if we could the inward man detect, God knowes that I am not deceavd a whit, Their gay apparrell covers litle witt. Most of our women are extreamly proud Of their faire lookes, &amp; therfore doe enshroud Their beauties in a maske; with greater care Their faces then their soules, to keepen faire. Some of this kinde when beauty gins decay, By art restore what nature takes away, Painting their visage. Cursed Iesabell That taught them this, will bring them all to hell. This vice in woeman only doth not bide, Men alsoe are infected with this pride. Some curle their pates to make their lookes more fair, Others delight to wear a locke of haire, A lovelocke, which being of the longest size Doth the lewd wearer quite effeminize. Nay some with fucus will besmear their face, It ads to their complexion better grace. I knowe a snowt-faire, selfe-conceited asse, Which is still prying in a looking glasse To see his fooles face, washt with ly o 'th' chamber, And set his beard, perfumde with greece of amber, Or kembe his civet lockes, soe far in love With his owne beauty, that I fear hee'l proove Sicke with conceat; for the which maladie I can prescribe no better remedy Then wish the glasse, wherin he views his face, A river, him to take Narcissus place, So the next time he came on 's face to looke He should be drench√®d in the liquid brooke. But leaving him a courting in the glasse His owne vaine shadowe, I this coxcome passe. Others there be which, selfe-conceited wise, Take a great pride in their owne vaine surmise, That all men think them soe; these take delight To hear themselves speak; if they can recite A thing scarce worth the hearing, they will prate Till they tire all men with their idle chatt. Others, ambitious like fond Phaeton, Aspire to guide the chariot of the sunne, Aiming at honours far above their place, Till by their pride they worke their owne disgrace. Presumptuous pride in others doth remaine, And these high Ioves almighty power disdaine, And (like those giants) fight against the gods, Till, Pharoah like, they scourg√®d are with rods Of dire affliction, &amp; their hardned hearts Vnto their guilty soule dispaire impartes. But I too much insist in generall:‚Äî Pride in particular must be dealt withall. He that desires to breake a bunch of wandes, Must not take all at once into his handes, But singlie, one by one; and if he trie, He may then break them with facility. Reader, doe thou the application make, For I to other matters me betake. Proud Romish prelat, triple crown√®d Pope, Which vauntst of Peters heavenly keis, that ope The dore that leads vnto celestiall blisse; Which makst great princes stoope thy foote to kisse, Emperours vpon thy stirrop to attend, When as thou wilt thy stately horse ascend; Damd Antichrist, proud Lucifers first sonne, Ambitious beast, great whore of Babilon! Thou false vsurper of Gods regal throne, How darst assume his honour, which, alone Monarch of heaven &amp; earth, disdaine[s] to see Corrivals in his sacred Emperie? How darst thou take vpon thee such authority Which doth belong to Gods high majesty, To forgive sinnes, to award heaven &amp; hell At thine owne pleasure? Wher didst learne to swell With such ambition? Thinkst thou Peeters chaire Can sheild thee from Gods wrath? Can once impaire And lessen thy deserv√®d punnishment? Can free thee from eternall detriment? Thinkst thou that he presumption can abide, Which did not spare his angels for their pride? No. Thou shalt finde that he will vengeance take, Sending thee headlong to the Stygian lake. Maddam Popp√¶a is soe stately growne That she can neither sit nor walke alone; Store of attendants still must wait vpon her, And doe obsequious homage to her honour. The ground she thinkes vnworthy is to bear Her precious body; when she doth vprear Her selfe vpon her feet, there must be spread Rich clothes of Arras wher she goes to tread. If she doe ride, the horse that must vpholde So rare a burden must be shod with golde. When she intends to wash her selfe she hath Of goats pure milck a sweet prepar√®d bath. Musick beyond the musick of the spheares Must still attend vpon her itching eares. Her food must be Ambrosian delicates, Dissolv√®d pearle her drink. Impartiall fates! How can ye suffer this lascivious quean Thus swell in pride, thus swim in pleasures streame, And holde your thunder fast? Proud, stately dame, Which more respectst thy body then thy fame, Or thy soules health, know that all working Power Which did confound (by wormes that did devour His cursed body) Herods lofty pride, Will, when thou thinkst thou art most diefied, Sevearly punnish with confusion, To thy soules horrour, this presumption. Lucius spends his substance &amp; his store, To keep in gallant fashion his proud whore, Yet al 's to litle to maintaine her pride; She must be coatcht, forsooth, &amp; bravely ride. Lackies before her charriot must run, And she in spangled gold, clothd like the sunne, Dazels the eyes of men, or she complaines He loves her not, &amp; such a man maintaines His love in better fashion! Then his land Must flie, for soe his mistris doth command, To bolster vp her pride. O foolish sot, Thus to procure thy reputations blot, Thy states vndooing, &amp; thy soules perdition For on[e] soe base &amp; of soe vile condition! Drusus, that fashion-imitating ape, Delights to follow each fantastique shape; Every new habit of hell-hac[t]hed sinne, Though it vndooe him, hee'l be cloth√®d in; And prodigally vpon every toy Lash out his substance; 'tis his only ioy To see himselfe not differing in a hair From the true stamp of a brave Cavaleer. Vain Epainnutus, selfe-admiring gull, Doth speake orations, write whole volumes full Of his owne praises. Silly, simple sotte, Hast thou that auncient, true saide sawe forgot, That ‚Äúa mans praise in his owne mouth doth stinke‚Äù? Or dost (foole if thou dost) absurdly think This age such shallow pated men affords, That will give credit to thy boasting wordes? Because in gay apparell thou art drest Some puppet-like thou dost advaunce thy crest, And swell in big lookes like some turkie cocke, Ready to burst with pride, &amp; even to choake With selfe-conceit of thy perfection, Which is iust nowe, though the infection Of thy high leveld thoughts lets thee not see The ougly face of thy deformity. Thou which thinkst Adon, that same lovely boy, Dame Natures dareling, Cithereas joy, A taunie Negro, or Barbarian Moore, Compar√®d to thy selfe, &amp; dost adore Even thine owne beauty like some demigod, Which (for on purpose thou dost goe abroad To shew thy selfe), thou vainely dost surmise Doth even ravish the beholders eyes. Noe wench that sees thee, but straight fals in love With thy rare feature, &amp; doth wish to prove The tast of thy Ambrosian lip; one kisse From thy mirre-breathing mouth were endless blisse; But gavst thou other joyes (which in thee lies) They would be thought 'bove ioyes of paradise. Thou bladder full puft vp with vanity, Whom with my pen I prick, that ther migh[t] flie Out into open aire all windy pride, All self-conceit; then being repurifide, Before the purchase of all earthly pelfe Learn Solons saying, ‚ÄúMortall, know thy selfe.‚Äù Neotimus, why art thou growne so proud, Instead of Iuno to embrace a cloud I' nothing worth? These honours heapd vpon thee Are but as shadowes, &amp; will soone flie from thee. Ther is an everlasting dignity Of greater worth and more insignity, To be sought out, which thou shalt ne're attaine, If pride in thy aspiring thoughts doe reigne. Contemne not them because thy selfe art high, Who, if the heavens had pleasd, might equally Have rankd with thee, yet now are low in state; All men are not predestind to on[e] fate. Become more humble, &amp; cast downe thy looke, Least prides bait snare thee on the devils hooke, And having caught thee, hale thee downe to hell, With fiends in everlasting paines to dwell. For why shouldst thou be proud 'cause thou art high In titles of renown√®d dignity? Honour's a flower that will soon decay; Honour's a vapour, quickly blowne away; And 'tis a saying held for true of all, ‚ÄúA sudden rising hath a sudden fall.‚Äù Philarchus (which in his ambitious minde Devoures whole kingdomes) doth smale comfort finde In his olde vnckles new-framde married life, But lesse in the male issue of his wife. The bastard brat (for soe he calles his cozen) Defrauds his expectation of a dozen Of goodly lordships, which (his hopes were faire) Should come to him, as the next lawfull heire. But now this boy, which stands as a crosse-barre Twixt him &amp; home, doth all his fortunes marre. But long he shall not soe, if figs of Spaine, Or pils of Italy their force retaine; If ther be meanes that his pretence will furder, If ther be hands that dare enact a murder, Hee'l send his soule (wher himselfe ne're shall come) To Abrahams bosome (mans long lookd for home). Nor shall his aged vnckle 'scape this net, Least if he live he doe more sonnes beget; Least he more issue by this marriage have, He shalbe wedded shortly to his grave. But then his vnckles wife surviues, purchance Left quick with childe; &amp; then he may goe dance For a new living; no, he likes not that, She shall be soone pact after too, that's flat; Besides, her ioynture, in his heart engravde With duble greatnesse, by her death is savde. Ambitious slave! wilt make a crimsen flood Of thy neare dearest kinsmens vitall blood, To wash thy murdrous handes? Think not at all Vpon a deed so much vnnaturall! Shall hope of some vain titles move thy minde, To doe an act perpetually combinde With horrour of a guilty conscience (A most deserv√®d &amp; due recompence) Wilt thou for purchase of a litle land, With innocent blood distaine thy guilty hand? Desist; for murder 's an iniquity That for iust vengeance vnto heaven doth crie. And darst thou then insist in thy invention? Is there noe hope to alter thine intention? No! Thou art flesht in sinne, &amp; dost despise My Christian counsell; Satan blinde[s] thine eyes. Goe forward then in this lewd preparation, But know thou headlong runst vnto damnation. Thus Lucifer, which through ambition fell, Strives dayly to bring company to hell Of each degree &amp; sex, from every nation. Mortals, become more wise; make preparation Of armes defensiue to resist this devill Which would procure your everlasting evill. But you, whose vnrelenting heartes persist In fearfull pride, will then cry, ‚Äúhad I wist,‚Äù Yet all too late, when each his sinne shall rue; You having your iust meed, &amp; hell his due. Thoug[h] God awhile his punnishment delay, A thing deferd 's not taken quite away. But now enough of Luciferian pride, Ther 's other vices in the world beside. Sat[ira] 4. [AGAINST AVARICE, BRIBERY, APOSTASY.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Effodiuntur opes ex imo viscere terr√¶, Qu√¶ fiunt miseri causa, cibusque mali. Omnia sunt auro nostr√¶ v√¶nalia Rom√¶, Ius, pudor, &amp; probitas, favor &amp; ipse deus. Insatiate Avarice then first began To raigne in the deprav√®d minde of man After his fall; &amp; then his mother Earth, That gave first being to his bodies birth, Vngracious childe, he did begin to wound, And rend the bowels of the harmelesse ground; For precious metals &amp; rare minerals ies Her veines, her sinnewes, &amp; her arteries. Among these, Golde, Dame Tellus glittering sunne, Was with his sister Sylver, earth[s] bright moone, Digd from the center of rich Aurimont, Sol &amp; his sister Phebe to confront. But for that silver golde in price doth follow, Because from him, as Cynthia from Apollo, She takes her light, &amp; other mettals all Are but his vassaile starres; they well may fall Vnder his title, therfore I 'le expresse Others in him, the great includes the lesse. He that first searched the teeming earth for golde, Now as a demigod perhaps enrolde In Fames eternal booke, was the chief cause Of wronging right &amp; abrogating lawes. For since these mines bewi[t]chd the mindes of men, What mischiefs haue ensude my worthlesse pen Cannot delineat, but we all can tell The number infinitly doth excell; Omitting former ages &amp; strange climes, The vices of our nation in these times, So far excede in quality &amp; number, That to recite them would whole volumes cumber. Iustice, opprest by golden bribery, Hath left the earth-stage of mortality And fled to heaven for succour &amp; defence, Wher she doth keep eternall residence; And now our lawes for Mammons cursed golde Like as at open mart are bought &amp; solde. Our lawyers, like Demosthenes, are mute, And will not speak, though in a rightfull sute, Vnlesse a golden kei vnlocke their tongue; Then how thei 'l sweat, be it for right or wrong, And get their cause too, or it shall goe hard, When the poore client, of his right debard, Cursing the law, first for mans good ordainde, Grieves at his losse, which ne're can be regainde. Let some damnd villaine of all grace bereft Commit a murder, sacriledge, or theft, And if he can procure but store of pence Our iustice then will with the law dispence, And grant the hell-hound life, when, for lesse cause, Poore men abide the rigor of the lawes. Let lustfull Iove, that virgins would defloure, In Danaes lap rain but a golden shower, Her chastety will soone be washt away, And she be ready for his amarous play. Let some rich cuffe, Thersites-like in shape, Of far worse qualeties then an olde ape, Which hath nought in him that may speake him man, But a good purse; although he scarcely can Speake without slavering, goe without a crutch, Be rivall to a man that is not such In wealth, though far above him in desertes, As good discent, rare features, vertuous partes; Yet for all this, I ten to one will lay, The richer man carries the wench away. Honours &amp; offices, which in times of olde Were given for deserts, are bought for golde. Sir Iohn Lacklattin, one that ne're did passe In any place, but for an ignorant asse, If he can grease his patron in the fist, Shall for his gold be richly beneficde; When he that better doth deserve the place, If poore, shall be repuls√®d with disgrace. Lode but a silly asse with store of golde And he will enter in the strongest holde. Let a foole passe by in a golden coate, He shalbe reckond for a man of note By those that know him not, when on[e] that's wise, Poore in arraie, seemes abiect in their eyes. Tradesmen make no account for golden gaine To sell their soules vnto eternall paine; Daily each one, in vttering of his wares, Cosens his chapmen &amp; himselfe forsweares. The vserer hords golde vp in his chest, Making an idole of it. To be blest Is to get store of golde, the wre[t]ch doth thinke; When the fruition scarcely lets him winke, For sleep he cannot, till i' th' end his pelfe Shipwracks his soule vpon hels rocky shelfe. Many for golde have turnd (like Iulian) Apostates to true religion, And have, with wicked Iudas, Iesus solde For the vaine purchase of a litle golde. Thus doth the devill, full of slie deceits, Fish for the soules of men with golden baites; And to increase his kingdome, doth assay By this temptation to pervert our way. Well did the Laced√¶mons banish golde Out of their common wealth; well did they holde Community of all things necessary; For by this meanes they were not accessary Vnto the many kindes of wickednes, Which the vnsatiable greedinesse Of golde in this our iron age begets; Which to entrap, so many kinde of nets, So many damn√®d plots are dayly laide; He that gets moste thinks himselfe best apaide, And well he may, for in a golden string A man may lead the world to any thing. What in these days may not a man command, That seekes to purchase with a golden hand? Fortunate Fatuo was late dubd a knight, Not for his wit, or for his martiall fight; For wit ne're blest him, valour never knewe him; What may the cause be then that only drew him To this preferment? Faith, his store of wealth, For honours now ar[e] purchas√®d by stealth Of vndermining bribes. Canst thou disburse Good store of coine from a well lined purse? Thou shalt not want authority to grace thee, And in an office of repute to place thee, Be thy life ne're so vilde. O evill times, And ill conditioned men, that act such crimes, Which great meanes then good meaning better deeme, And more of goods then goodnesse doe esteeme! But bootelesse I exclaime on this same age, This vnrelenting age, whose furious rage Will not be mollified as it hath been, But is now hardned in vngodly sinne. Yet, though the world nothing the better grow, I 'le rip vp all the villanies I know. Flavia, because her meanes are somewhat scant, Doth sell her body to relieve her want, Yet scornes to be reputed as a quean, Though with moste nations she have been vnclean. English, Scots, Dutch, French, Spannish, yea, black Moor[es], If they bring store of gold, her open dores Conveigh to private lust; bee 't day or night, Golde vshers them to sensuall delight. Thus often fighting vnder Cupids banner Perhaps she's sometimes taken in the manner, And being brought before authority, Which should correct her hell-bread villany, If golde speake for her in the present tense, The officer deputed for th' offence Will winck at smale faultes &amp; remit correction. This foolish, knavish pittie's an infection Spread through our land, &amp; hurtes our common wealth‚Äî Iustice restore her to her former health! For true 's the saying (magistrates, beware!) ‚ÄúHe harmes the good that doth the evill spare.‚Äù Midas is patron to a goodly living, And Stolido, that dunce, hath now been driving A price for it. What, benefices solde? This was not wont to be in times of olde, But Simonie is now soe common growne, That 'tis account noe sinne, if kept vnknowne. Or otherwise, lawes danger to prevent, The patron with the parson will indent That he shall have the living in this wise, Suffering him yearly to reserve his tithes; When the whole parish knowes the better part Of all the living, those his tithes imparte. Thou wicked imp, thus to abuse the C[h]urch, And with such sacrilegious handes to lurch Gods sacred duties, which he doth afford To the dispensers of his holy word! How dar'st thou with all-seeing Iove dissemble? Me thinkes thou shouldst with great amazment tremble At that most fearfull yet just punnishment Powrd downe one Ananias, whose intent, Like thine, was in most damnd hypocrisie To mocke God with a shew of charity. But for this sinne he &amp; his curs√®d wife Suddenly fell downe dead &amp; lost his life. Take heed the like plague fall not on thy head, If thou persist, high Iove can strike thee dead; Though he awhile forbear to shew his ire, His mercy keeps back what thy sinnes require. Signior Necessity, that hath no law, Scarce ever read his Litleton, a daw To a solliciter, is now become Iustice of peace &amp; coram; takes his roome 'Mongst grave &amp; learned Iudges; is still cald Right worshipfull, his wit &amp; pate both bald. And yet the foole expects th' ensuing year To be elect high sherif of all the sheire. I, &amp; he hath great hopes, for the whole tribe Of voices that elect the sherif hee 'l bribe; And after that he hopes to get consent By this meanes to be knight o' th' parliament. Base minded peasants, which for some few pence Give to [a] foole such place of eminence! Ignoble Crassus did in litle time Vnto the top of honours mountaine clime; If you aske how he rose, let this suffice, His wealth was great, &amp; therfore needs must rise. Ruffino, that same roring boy of fame, By braules &amp; wenches is diseasde &amp; lame; Yet hath some store of crownes left in his purse, Which he with all his heart would fain disburse, And those that healpt him benefactours call, To get a place in the new hospitall. Fear not Ruffino, for it is decreed Those that have meanes to give shall only speed. Loth am I to rip vp my nurces shame, Or to accuse for this those schooles of fame, The Academies: yet for reformation Of this abuse, I must reprove the fashion Of divers seniors, which for private gaine Permit some ignorant asse, some dunce, attaine A schollers or a fellowes place among 'em. Some think perhaps of malice I doe wrong 'em, But the poore students know it to be true, Which wanting meanes, as often want their due. Art was not thus rejected heertofore, But plenty now hath made a scholler poore. Learning was wont to be the highest staire, Vpon whose top was fixd preferments chaire; In which the best deserver was instald, The worthiest man to highest honour cald. But now the world's altred, chang√®d is the molde, And learnings step is turnd to massie golde. To get preferment who doth now intend, He by a golden ladder must ascend. Thus cursed golde doth bear soe great a sway That nurseries of learning doe decay; For not the meanes of taking our degrees Are quite exempt from bribes; for duble fees A dunce may turne a Doctour, &amp; in state Walke in his scarlet! O, vnhappy fate! When paltry pelfe doth worthlesse ignorance Vnto the top of learnings mount advaunce. Cocus, that faine would thrive, hath a[n] intent, To curry favour, to dresse meat in Lent‚Äî How is 't to be obtainde? hast store of golde? And canst thou spare a litle? then be bolde, Persue thy project, &amp; I 'le vndertake The overseers will a licence make, By which is granted leav to dresse for th' sicke,‚Äî Vnder the colour of which pretty tricke Thou mayst make sale of it to whom thou list. Sayth master mony-taker, greasd i' th' fist, ‚ÄúAnd if tho[u] comst in danger, for a noble I 'le stand thy friend, &amp; healp thee out of trouble.‚Äù But these are petty crimes which now I cote, This vicious age acts sinnes of greater note, And them by greater persons, in which sence Th' offenders greatnesse aggravates th' offence. Taurus, that ruffen, in his drunken fit An execrable murder did committe, For the which fact he straight was apprehended, And should, had right tooke place, have been condemn√®d. But marke th' event; his mony stood his friend, And sav'd the caitife from a shamefull end. For having the chief iudge sollicited With bribes, from iustice him he quite misled; Who when he should pronounce his condemnation, Instead therof gave him his approbation, Vowing there was good reason him to clear, 'Cause 40 angels did to him appear, Which spake him guiltlesse. O, rare vision, And admirable golden apparition, That had the power to make good such evill, And turne a demigod into a devill! Turnus his enemy would faine supplant, Yet how to doe it iustly, cause doth want. His Machiavillian pate doth then devise To overthrow him by meer forgeries; Then saith he is a traiter to his prince, And that he can of treason him convince. Divers seditious wordes are then invented, For which he is before the iudge convented; But there wants witnesse to confirme this lie,‚Äî Tut, they are easily found; his neighbours by Are knights o' th' post, and for a litle coine Will swear what ever he doth them enjo[i]ne. Thus armde, he brings to passe his damn√®d will, And like a villian guiltlesse blood doth spill. But he &amp; 's knights o' th' post will post to hell, That thus their soules vnto damnation sell. Codrus to his poore cottage had some land, With which, &amp; with the labour of his hand, Six litle children &amp; his sickly wife He did maintaine in such estate of life As his best meanes could yeild, sufficient Because they therwithall did live content. But now Antilegon, his neighbour by, Because the ground did lye commodiously For his owne vse to make a garden plot, Hath encroacht all &amp; sure possession got, Which he maintaines by force. Poor Codrus is Constraind to sue sub form√¢ pauperis, (As wanting friends &amp; mony) to regaine What is his owne. T' other doth entertaine The best of counsell, &amp; his golde 'gainst lawes O're throwes the poor man in his rightfull cause; Who with his family are quite vndone, Through this vnjust &amp; damnd oppression. Thus Iustice eyes closde vp in golden sleep, The ravenous woolfe eats vp the harmlesse sheep. Thou wicked Ahab, which hast got possession By such iniurious transgression, Think that if God inflict damnation On them that doe not take compassion Of their poore bretheren, &amp; their wants relieve, What will he doe to thee, which seekst to grieve With an oppressours hand the innocent! Being not only not to give content, But even to take away by cursed wrong All that in right doth to the poore belong? Vnlesse thou doe due restitution make, And to a better life thy selfe betake; Vnlesse repentance purchase grace from Iove And his iust iudgements from thee quite remooue, Surely the Lord (which doth such sinne detest) With horrid tormentes will thy soule invest. And you, which should true equity dispense, Yet bear a gold-corrupted conscience, Looke for some plague vpon your heades to light, That suffer rich wrong to oppresse poore right. All lawyers I cannot heerof accuse, For some there are that doe a conscience vse In their profession. This our land containes Some in whose heart devine Astr√¶a raignes. To these, whose vertue keeps our land in peace, I wish all good, all happiness encrease. Go forward then, and with impartiall handes Hold Iustice ballance in faire Albians landes. Olde greedy minded Pandarus hath a paire Of daughters whom the world reputeth faire, And faire indeed they are to outward eyes, Which not discerne inward deformities; These, for the purchase of a litle golde, By the olde miser vnto lust are solde. This slave will even vsher his disgrace, Bringing his daughters vnto any place Which is appointed to commerce with sinne, And himselfe keep the dore, whilst that within The shamlesse strumpetes are with lust defilde, Having the gallants of their golde beguilde. Impious villaine! to defame the fruit Of thine owne loynes, &amp; basely prostitute Thy childrens body to such luxurie, Whom with paternall care &amp; industrie Thou shouldst traine vp in vertuous education, For want whereof theire horrid imprecation Will light vpon thy soule, &amp;, which is worse, Gods fearfull plaugues second thy childrens curse. Me thinkes the hellish &amp; mad lunacy Of them that doe commit apostacie For gold, might well a Christian heart affright Only to hear another but recite So damnd a sinne; yet every day their fall In these relapses diabolicall Many, too many,‚ÄîChristians shall I name them? Ah, noe! their actions otherwise defame them. Some have tur[n]d Turkes for gaine, yet live despisde After they once have been but circumcisde. Base slaves, which Dagon 'bove the Arcke doe set, And for true Christ adore false Mahomet. But Mahomet, as Dagon did, shall fall, And all those wicked priests that worship Baal. Others, that would to high preferment come, Leave vs, &amp; flie vnto the Sea of Rome. But how dost prosper with them being there? Contemptibly they live, &amp; full of feare. Is ther some damned enterprise in hand, To murder princes, ruinate a land? These be the men that must be actours in it, Who ever were the author to beginne it. If they refuse, 'tis death; if they proceed Death &amp; damnation waites vpon their deed. Thus chaind in wre[t]ched servitude, doth live A runagate, &amp; English fugitive; And yet like fooles, they doe submit their necke Vnto the slavish yoke &amp; proudest checke Of Romes insulting tyrant, vpon hope That their demerits will win larger scope; Many which theither dayly flocke apace To worke their owne confusion &amp; disgrace Witnesse their fearfull endes &amp; wre[t]ched lives: ‚ÄúBut goe they must because the devill drives.‚Äù Carrier of late would have made his career (Thinking perhaps to be esteem√®d dear Of th' antichristian prelate) to the citty Of seven hilld Rome, ‚ÄúO, &amp;,‚Äù say some, ‚Äú'twas pitty That his (how e're they grant it lewd) intent Met not a look't for prosperous event. For he, because his learning was not small, Might in short time have been a Cardinall.‚Äù What the successe had prov'd I dare not say, For he was cut of from his wish√®d prey; High Iove incensd that thus he should backslide Stroke him, &amp; in a neighbour land he died. Some think he was not Apostolicall, But alwaies in his heart papisticall; Certaine it is, how e're they can excuse him, The devill in this act did but abuse him. And were he not apostate in his flight, In his stay heer he was an hypocrite. Pistor was falln into great poverty, How come he to grow rich thus sodenly? For he of late hath matchd his daughter well Vnto a gentleman, as I hear tell, Of faire demeanes, &amp; great extent of ground, And made her portion worth five thousand pound. Why, once within these five year (as was thought) Ten poundes would all the wealth he had have bought, And now he 's in his thousandes! This quick change, This sodaine metamorphosis is strange. Belike he hath found out some mine of golde, Or else the Fairies bring him heapes vntolde Because he sweeps his house cleane, sets a light, Faire water in a basen, every night, And other pretty toyes, to doe them pleasure; Or else some spirit shewes him hidden treasure. O now you hitt it, 'twas indeed a spirit, To whom, for certaine tearme of yeares t' inherit His ease and pleasure with aboundant wealth, He hath made sale of his soules dearest health. And in a deed engrost, signd with his blood, Sould soule &amp; body with all hope of good In heavenly ioyes to come, vnto the devill. O horrid act! O execrable evill! Another Faustus, haplesse, hopelesse man, What wilt thou doe, when as that litle sand Of thy soone emptied houreglasse, is spent? When horrour of thy conscience keeps repent From thy black spotted soule? O (but in vaine) Thou wilt then wish (&amp; think it ease, not paine) ‚ÄúThat I had that estate of grace I solde [For the] fruition of a litle golde. Thoug[h] I liv'de ne're soe miserablie poore, And like an abject begd at every doore Millions of yeares, I could be well content To 'scape the everlasting punnishment Of hells infernall lake, &amp; purchase heaven, Of which for ever I am now bereaven.‚Äù Then wilt thou curse thy selfe, thy wretched fate, The wombe that bare thee, him that thee begat; Wish thou hadst been a beast, a sencelesse stone, To 'scape that horrour of confusion. But wishes, vowes, &amp; horrid execration Cannot preserve thee from damnation. Thus each thing of esteem is bought and solde For mindes-corrupting, soules-confounding golde. Sellers take heed, &amp; byers have a care, This is no common ordinary ware! Looke to 't betimes, lest you to late repent The poore mans curse, earths plague, hells punnishment! Sat[ira] 5. [AGAINST GLUTTONY, DRUNKENNESS, AND TOBACCO.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Nobiscum in terris Epicuri vivitur instar Delitijs: ventri mille placere modi. Turpior ebrietas animam cum corpore f≈ìdat, Et demum ad Stygias ducit vtrumque domos. From thirst of wealth &amp; golden villany I now am come to brutish gluttonie, Of which my Muse doth almost loath to treat, It is soe base a crime, yet growne soe great In customary action, that 'tis deemd If sinne, a smale one, not to be esteemd. This vice doth not alone it selfe extend T' excesse in meat, but eke doth comprehend That base vnmanly sinne of drunkennesse, Whose worse then worst of brutish beastlinesse Defiles both soule &amp; body, &amp; doth bring Both of them to eternall ruining. This age of men to that excesse is growne That was I think in Sodome never knowne, Although it were that capitall offence, Which iustly did all-seeing Iove incense Them &amp; their citty vtterly to quell With fire which from heavens architecture fell. How can we wretches in this sinfull time Expect lesse vengeance for as damnd a crime? For to speake first of our excesse in meat, Though man should eat to live, not live to eate, Many there are which only vse their care In dainty banquetes and delitious fare. What beast doth breed in our Britannicke soile That doth delight the tast, but we doe toile To take &amp; kill? What bird doth cut the aire With her swift wing, but that we doe repaire Therwith our tables? We doe fish all seas To catch the rarest dish, therby to please Our dainty palates: &amp; yet fish, bests, birdes, Which in aboundance this our land affordes, Are not sufficient; we must have more cates From other nations at excessive rates To furnish out our table, which (like swine That eat the fruit, but ne're cast vp their eyen To the faire tree) we dayly doe devour Without thankesgiving to that heavenly power, Whose gracious goodnesse doth such blessinges give, And suffers vs so peaceably to live In such a land of plenty that doth flow With milck &amp; hony, which we doe bestow To pamper our selves &amp; please our sence Like Epicures; as if alone from thence We had our being, &amp; vnto that end, The cause of our creation, did intend. Thus are the guiftes, wherwith God man doth blesse, Abusd'e by vaine &amp; riotus excesse. Like the rich gluttons in the Gospell are The feastes we make, from which we doe debarre The poorer sort of men. Well may they lie Before our dores, &amp; crave our charity; But with poore Lazarus they shall obtaine Cold comfort, &amp; small reliefe to sustaine Their hunger-starv√®d bodies, while within The richer sort doe stand vp to the chin In delicates, &amp; euen with excesse, Are like to surfet; while the wantonnesse Of their insatiat appetite, that feeds On such plurality of viands, breeds Offensive humors. This I thinke the cause Which our rich men to such diseases drawes, Wherwith we dayly see they are tormented, When if with moderate fare they were contented They might both keep their bodies in good health, And save the residue of all their wealth To feed the hungry soule, the naked cherrish, Which wanting succour still one heaps doe perish. But now let me discourse of drunkennes, Which is a part of gluttony, whose excesse Is likewise of the belly, &amp; is made Even a common ordinary trade. We count the nation of the German Dutch The greatest drunkard, but our land as much, Or rather more, is with this vice infected, Which doth deserue sharply to be corrected, And yet 'tis slackly punnishd; but 'twere good That Dracoes [laws] for ours in vertue stood. This vice, I say, with vs as frequent is As with the Dutchmen, who, if I not misse Mine aime, were the first founders of this sinne Within our country; but we now beginne T' appropriate to our selves their noted vice, So apt we are to follow each devise That tendes to wickednesse &amp; villany; After forbidden things we swiftly flie, When after that from which much good may growe, Although by force compeld, we slowly goe. But man must follow the times fashion, And shew himselfe an ape in imitation Of every new found &amp; hell-hatched sinne Or else he is not counted worth a pinne. He that cannot sit quaffing all the day, Carousing healths till wit &amp; wealth decay; Which will not vpon every lewd request Drink drunk in kindenesse, why, he 's made a jest To those companions, whose licentious veine And drunken humours still doe entertaine The basest speeches, &amp; in their mad fit Doe speake at randome without fear or wit. How far vnlike Lacedemonians, Though they were hethen &amp; we Christians, Are men in this our age? To them this crime Soe loathsome was, that they would finde a time To make the Helottes drunk, which wer their slaves, A sort of loutish, abject-minded knaves; And being in the basest sort disguisde, Shew them their children, mock them as despisde And debaush creatures, by their beastlynesse, To teach their young to loath all drunkennesse. But if others will not doe it for vs Will even fox ourselves till all abhorre vs. Well may it fit this our vntemperate age, To shew a drunkard in his equipage. I 'le passe Apitius, which spent all the year, In brave carrousing, &amp; fine belly-cheer; He that to please his sence had at one feast His thousand severall dishes at the least, Although he had noe other company But his sole single selfe to satisfie; For all the flesh that Noahs Arke contained, The whole seas fish, if he had entertained His friends, could not sufficient store afforde, To furnish out th' insatiate gluttons borde. Thus he run one, till on[e] yeares gluttony Brought him from millions vnto poverty: I will omit the brave √Ügiptian Dame, Which by her death hath got eternall fame, Proud Cleopatra, Anthonies loose minion, Who, to obtaine her lovers good opinion, Did in a cup of wine, drunk to his health, Carouse dissolv√®d pearles of infinite wealth; Her great excesse &amp; sensuall gluttony Procurde her owne &amp; his sad tragedie. I 'le leave th' Assirian Sardanapalus, With that lewd Roman, Heliogabolus; Only their riot was the fatall knife That cut them of from empire &amp; from life. Examples from soe farre I need not fetch, We have more moderne ones within our reach; In this our native Isle, each day, each hower Millions of such like subiects doe ever shower Before our eyes, which live in vaine excesse Of soule-polluting, beastly drunkennesse. On[e] pot companion &amp; his fashion I will describe, &amp; make relation Of what my selfe have seene, that they that hear it May hate the like, &amp; hating may forbear it. Cervisius is a most accomplisht man, Whether he deale at halfe pot or whole can, No flincher, but as true a drunkard bred As ever lifted cup vnto his head. A right good fellow, a true ioviall boy, And on[e] that of his purse is nothing coy; Hee 'l spend his dozen of beer with any friend, And fox him if he can, before hee 'l end; I, or hee 'l fox himselfe, but that 's no wonder The fox &amp; he are seldome time a sunder. But if the man, to sobernesse inclinde, Refuse to follow his inordinate minde, Because his nature cannot brooke to doe it, His stab is ready to compell him to it. This alehouse-haunter thinkes himselfe a safe If he with his companions, George &amp; Rafe, Doe meet together to drink vpsefreese Till they have made themselves as wise as geese. O ther this man (like lord within a hutch) Will pay for all &amp; ne're his mony grutch; Th[e]y must not part till they have drunk a barrell, Or straight this royster will begin to quarrell. Wher e're they meet, to th' alehouse they must goe, He sweares they shall, &amp; they must not say noe. As soone as e're the alehouse them receives, The tapster, duble diligent, straight leaves His other guestes, in course to take his cup, And make the full messe of these drunkards vp; He knowes what best belongs vnto his gaine, These are the men he seekes to entertaine. Then straight into the seller hee 'l them bring,‚Äî 'Tis sweetest drinking at the verry spring,‚Äî Wher as a barrell, for the nonce set out, Must straight be pearc'd, then each must haue his bout And drink vp all; to leave a litle snuffe Is petty treason; &amp; such pretious stuffe Must not be throwne away. Thus they drink round, Vntill their adle heads doe make the ground Seeme blew vnto them; till their hands doe shake, Their tongues speak duble, &amp; their braines do ake. But they proceed till one drop[s] downe dead drunke, Wher he doth lie long time, a sencelesse trunk; And all the rest in a sweet pickle brought (Such operation hath the barrell wrought), Lie downe beside him. One straight falles a sleep Ready to drowne himselfe, in that doth keep The broken beer from spoiling; then another Falles into spuing, &amp; is like to smother Himselfe in his owne vomit. He that least Seemes to be drunk, yet shewes himselfe a beast, And that 's the tapster, which hath got a tricke, Because he would prevent his being sick, To force himselfe to cast, then on the barrell To take a nap. Thus ends this drinking quarrell. After some 3 howers sleepes strong operation Hath brought their braines into a better fashion, They gin to wake, &amp; finding themselves ill Of their late surfet, which hath force to kill The strongest body, to 't afresh they goe, To drink away their paine; such heartsick woe By an immoderate drunkennesse procurde, Must by ‚Äúa haire of the same dog‚Äù be curde. Then once againe the pot must keep his round, Vntill the barrell, with his hollow sound, Fortell his emptinesse. Trivmphantly They doe then eccho forth this victory, As 'twere a conquest, that deserv'd with golde In Fames eternall booke to be enrolde. But still Cervicius paies for all, his purse Defraies all recknings; there must none disburse A penny but himselfe. ‚ÄúTut, I have landes Which now of late are come into my handes, And whilst they last, I will not want good drink, Nor boon companions. Wherfore was my chinck Made but to spend? And can 't be better spent Then 'mongst good laddes in ioviall meriment? Faith, no. Flie, brasse! More precious I do holde Maltes pure quintessence then king Harries golde. Good liquor breeds good blood, good blood best health, And that 's a iewell to be prisde 'bove wealth. Drink round, sweet George, to me, my turne is next, And I'le charge honest Rafe; let 's ply our text Without digression. Tapster, take your bout, Leave not a drop, you'r best, but drink all out. Why soe, brave boyes, this gear doth cotten well, I think we foure might win the silver bell Of any 4 in Europe, for our drink. Let 's make a challenge, Rafe; I doe not think But we shall put downe all that dare contest With vs in this, if we but doe our best. And yet ther were 4 roring boyes, they say, That drunk a hogshead dry in one poor day. Tapster, some beer; the conceit makes me dry! Heer honest rogue, night partes good cumpany; But my good lades, let 's meet againe to morrow, And at this fountaine we will drinke downe sorrowe.‚Äù Thus he runs on his course, til 's drunken vaine Ruines his substance, makes him entertaine For his companion penurious want.‚Äî All other friends doe then wax wondrous scant; But this alone, when men fall in decay, Will never leave them till their dying day. His substance poore, his soule more poore in grace, Getes him contempt on earth, in hell a place Of everlasting paine, vnlesse the smart Of misery reforme his wicked heart. For sometimes want &amp; hard calamity Even Athiestes turnes to Christianity. But Bacchanall is of a higher straine, He scornes soe base a thought to entertaine, As to drink drunk with beer or botle-ale; Noe, he contemnes the vse, that fashion 's stale. Marry, your true elixar, all rare wine, That doth enspire, &amp; make the thoughtes divine! Whie, he esteemes the nectar of the goddes, Homers Nepenthe, to come short by oddes Of [this] delicious iuice. Rich Malago, Canarie, Sherry, with brave Charnico; Phalerno, with your richest Orleance wine, Pure Rhenish, Hippocras, white Muskadine, With the true bloud of Bacchus, Allegant, That addes new vigour which the backe doth want Are precious wines. Marrie, your white or Charret Is but so so; he cares not greatly for it; But for the rest, whose vertuous operation Doth cheer the heart opprest with passion, Doth rapsodize the soules intelligence Above the levell of inferiour sence, Why, had he to his wish the cranes long necke To tast with more delight, he would not wrecke Of all celestiall ioyes; this were a treasure To be preferd above that heavenly pleasure. From thine owne mouth, thou beastly Epicure, Dost thou condemne thy selfe, thou shalt be sure Never indeed to tast celestiall bliss! But know withall (though thou those joyes doe misse) That thou (when as thy soule will be agast) Shalt of the cup of Godes iust vengeance tast! Fower kindes of drunkardes this our age hath quoted, Which, since by observation I have noted, It shall not be amisse heer to insert, That we may know how much each doth pervert The soule of man. The first is merry drunk, And this, although his braines be somewhat shrunk I' th' wetting, hath, they say, but litle hart In his demeanour; to make harmles sport Is all his practise. In what fashion? Is baudie talke, &amp; damn√®d prophanation Of Godes most holy name, a harmlesse thing? Are apish tricks &amp; toies, which vse to bring Men in dirision, sportes to breed delight? Is that which makes the soule as black as night, Which takes away the perfect vse of sence, Which is the high way to incontinence, A thing of nothing? Whie, if this be soe, I graunt you then a drunken sot may goe For one that is innocuous; otherwise He is a beast &amp; worse, let that suffice. And if this be the hurtlesse sport you meant, Iove keepe me from such harmlesse merriment. The second kinde we maudline drunkardes call. I thinke the humid stuffe they drink doth fall Out of their eyes againe, for they distill Teares in great plenty. Woemen when they will Can weep, we say, but these doe never cry Except they first be drunk; but then they dry The fountaine of their teares quite vp before They cease from weeping, or doe once give o're Their dolefull lamentation. I suppose The name of ‚ÄúMaudline drunk‚Äù from hence arose. This kinde of drunkard is the kindest creature That ever did converse with mortall nature; When he is in his fit, you may commaund All that he has, his purse, his heart, his hand, To do you service; why hee 'l ever kill Your heart with kindenesse, soe you'l sit &amp; swill In his loathd presence; keep him company And he is pleasde, ther 's his felicity. And now I call to minde an accident That did befall to one of his lewd bent, One of these maudline drunkards (I will passe Over it briefly). In this sort it was: A certain wealthy-left young gentleman, One that had more skill how to quaffe a can Then manage his revenewes, for his ease Put out the best part of his land to lease, And had to tennant an olde crafty fox, Who, though his landlord made him a right oxe, Knewe for all that on which side of his bread The sweetnesse of the butter was yspread; Knew how to turn all to his best of gaine, And therfore did with patience entertaine His supposde wrong. What cannot thirst of golde Performe when men to wickednesse are solde? This old sinckanter, when he came to pay His landlordes rent at the appointed day, Was for the most part sure to finde him fast Within a taverne; whilst his coine did last Ther was his randevous. The mony tolde, Which was as welcome vnto him as golde, They needs must drink together ere they part. Then is wine cal'd for, &amp; quart after quart Comes marching in, till my young gallant fals Into his maudline fit, &amp; then he calles Afresh for wine, &amp; with right weeping eyes Hugging his tennant, ‚ÄúYou are welcome!‚Äù cryes, ‚ÄúIn faith you are, be God you are! Beleeve it, What is it thou willt have &amp; I will give it. Sha 't have a new lease for a hundred yeares, Of all the land thou holdst!‚ÄîI speake in teares Of my affection,‚Äî&amp; shalt yearly pay A peppercorne, a nutt, a bunch of may, Or some such trifle. Tut, man! I desire To have thee thrive,‚ÄîI only doe aspire To purchase credit; thou the gaine shalt reap;‚Äî Hang him that will not let his landes good cheap!‚Äù Well, for this time they part. Next quarter comes, And after that a third; he payes the summes, And findes his landlord in this humour still. Then doth the crafty fox begin to fill His braines with cunning; if his plotes doe hit To his desire, his landlordes want of wit Shall make him rich for ever. Vpon this He makes a feast to which he doth not misse To invite his landlord; but before, compacted With an atturney by whose healp directed, A paire of large indentures, fairely drawne, Are formally composde. These as a pawne Of his deer hopes he keeps, &amp; when the fit Hath quite deprivde my gallant of his wit, Hee 'l make his landlord set both hand &amp; seale To this new lease. Men of experience deale To their best proffit; &amp; it were as good That he should be a gainer as the brood Of cut-throat vintners. Well, to make short worke, My gentleman, his braines as light as corke With brave carrousing, fals to his odd vaine Of weeping kindenesse; nay, seemes to complaine That his kinde offer findes noe acceptation! Olde Gray-beard knowes his cue, &amp; by gradation Still drawes him one, till the kinde foole protestes Were the indentures drawne, so firme he restes In his opinion, ther should be a match, And his hand soone should all the rest despatch. Straight vpon this are the indentures brought; Witnesse there needs not, for the house is fraught With store [of] guestes; then the kinde harted gull Seales and subscribes to all: his wits are dull And senceless of this wrong. Thus is he shorne Of eight score poundes a year for one poore corne Of pepper, &amp; the lease, that hath noe flawe, For a whole hundred yeares is good in lawe. But now to passe this &amp; to make reporte Of lyon-drunkardes, which is the third sorte. Your lyon-drunkard is a kinde of man That in his fitt will rage, sweare, curse, &amp; banne, Break glasses, &amp; throw pottes against the wall, Quarrell with any man, &amp; fight with all That yield not to his rage. Mad Hercules, In the extreamest rage of his disease, Clad in the shirt which Deianira sent, Dipt in the blood of Nessus, to prevent His love to I√∂le, when the poyson boylde In every veine, &amp; with the torment spoilde And quite bereaft him of true reasons vse, Making him teare vp trees, &amp; break all truce With man &amp; beast, was not yet halfe soe madde As this outragious drunkard, nor soe bad T' encounter with; for this man is indeed Worse then a mad man. Let that man take heed Which comes within his reach; vnlesse he have More lives then one, this wretch will dig his grave. These are the men that make soe many fraies, That stab &amp; kill soe many now adayes, On whom just vengeance oftentimes attendes, Bringing their lives vnto most shamefull endes. The fowerth &amp; last kinde of this drunken crewe Is beastly drunk, &amp; these men vse to spue, Lying in gutters, &amp; in filthy mire, More like to swine then men. Promethean fire Is quite extinct in them; yea, vse of sence Hath within them noe place of residence. Some of this kinde, as if a deadly potion Had wrought th' effect, doe seeme to have no motion Of vitall faculties; a man would deeme That they were dead indeed, for soe they seeme, When only superfluity of drink Deceives the eye, &amp; makes the heart misthink. On[e] of these men (I am about to tell Noe fable, reader, therfore marke it well) Vpon mine owne moste true intelligence, Being dead drunk i' th' time of pestilence, Was thought t' have dide o' th' plague, &amp; seeming dead, Was amongst others alive buri√®d. But being by some of his companions mist, And diligent enquirie made, they wist At length what was become of him, &amp; went Vnto his place of buriall, with intent If it were possible to save his life. The grave digd vp, they saw with how great strife The drunken man, to wonted sence restorde, Had vsde himselfe, being all with blood begorde With violence to help himselfe was wrought, But all in vaine; for not the aide they brought, Which came too late, nor his owne power, could shend This wretched man from a moste fearfull end. Surely this iust example doth expresse, How much God hates this beastly wickednesse. Yet sinfull man, whose very heart should bleed With recordation of soe straunge a deed, Is not reformd a iot from this lewd sinne, But every day more deeply plung√®d in. Nay, drunkennesse hath got an arch-defender, Yea, more then that, a principall commander, A great phisitian, which prescribes some dayes Wherin 'tis necessary, as he saies, To drink drunk for the bodies better health, And being done in private &amp; by stealth, It is a thing of nothing! What phisitian, Whose vertuous minde, religious condition, Speak him a Christian, would once entertaine Soe vilde a thought, or such a lye maintaine? It is some at[h]eist sure, vpon my life, Some Epicure, for 'mongst such men ar[e] rife These damnd opinions; on[e] that knowes noe God, Was neuer scourg√®d with afflictions rod, And therfore luld a sleep in pleasures lap, Securely sinnes, &amp; feares no after-clap. This man, which only setteth vp his rest In that which man communicates with beast, The soule of sence, denies th' eternity Of th' intellectual part, &amp; doth apply All his endevours to delight the sence; Noe marle though he with drunkennesse dispence, Which, though it may the bodies health secure, The soules continuall death it doth procure. Old Monsier Gray-beard with your poynts vntrust, Dublet vnbuttond, ready for your lust; You, which the chamber wher you lay your head With baudie pictures round about doe spread; Which make your maide daunce naked to your eyes, Only to see her veines &amp; arteries; Which hast given out this foolish prophesie, That, vnlesse throngd to death, thou ne're shalt die; And therfore neither vnto church nor faire, Nor any publicke meeting darst repaire, But idlie livest at home in ease, secure, A very atheist, &amp; meer Epicure, This is your axiome, ‚Äúdrunkennesse is good To clear the stomach, &amp; to purge the blood.‚Äù Well maist thou be a good phisitian But I am certaine a bad Christian. After the killing of some hundred men, And yet I scarcely recken one for ten, To trie the working of thy minerals, Thy hearbes, thy drugges &amp; such materials, Perhaps some litle knowledge thou hast gaind To ease the head or stomach, being painde; To help an ague-shaken bodie, cure A fever, dropsie, gout, or cicature; All this, &amp; more then this, as farre as nature Permites thy skill to healp a mortall creature, Suppose thou canst performe; graunt thou couldst give To a dead body force againe to live, As poetes faine that √Üsculapious Did to vnjustly slaine Hypolitus; Yet all thy skill wherof thou makst thy vaunt Is nothing worth, because thou standst in want Of the true knowledge of thy soules salvation, The sweetnesse of whose only contemplation, The vertue of thy art doe passe, as farre As bright Apollo doth the meanest starre. Which if thou knewst, it would thee quickly teach Another lesson, far above thy reach Of principles in phisick:‚Äîthat noe evill (Which had it's first begin[in]g from the devill) Though good ensue therby, must be committed, Yea though the ill with more good be requitted. How much more then soe horrible a crime As drunkennesse, whose putrefactious slime Darkens the splendour of our common wealth, Must not be acted to secure the health Of the base body (I doe call it base In reference to the soule), so to deface The purer part of man; yea, by such action, The loathsomnesse of whose infection Makes man, indued with reason, worse then beast; Both soule &amp; body doe become vnblest, Vnsanctifi√®d members, &amp; vnlesse Godes grace in time this wickednesse represse, Th' all both together perish, &amp; remaine In hels eternally tormenting paine. Besides ale, beer, &amp; sundry sortes of wine From forren nationes, whose more fruitfull vine Yeilds plenty of god Bacchus, we have got Another kinde of drinke, which well I wot Is of smale goodnesse, though our vaine delight Follow it with excessive appetite; And that 's Tobacco, a rare Indian weed, Which, because far fetcht only, doth exceed In vertue all our native hearbes,‚Äîfor what? For many pretious vses, vertues that May be applide to phisicke? Graunt it soe, Although I see great reason to say noe; How can that iustifie our common taking In such excesse, our even for that forsaking All other nutrime[n]tes? Doe we applie Phisick in this sorte? If I should say I, I should belie my knowledge; phisicks vse Serv's only to reforme the knowne abuse Of the distempered body, &amp; must be But seldome, &amp; with mediocrity, Applide on speciall causes when they fall; To take Tobacco thus were phisicall, And might perphaps doe good; but this excesse And ordinarie practise, questionlesse, Annoyes th' internall partes &amp; makes them foule, But I am sure commaculates the soule. Yet in these dayes hee 's deemd a very gull That cannot take Tobacco; every skull And skip-iacke now will have his pipe of smoke, And whiff it bravely till hee 's like to choke. You shall have a poore snake, whose best of meanes Is but to live on that he dayly gleanes By drudgery from others, which will spend His pot of nappy ale vpon his friend, And his Tobacco with as ioviall grace, As if he were a lord of some faire place And great revenewes! ‚ÄúTut, why should he not? I hope a man may spend what he hath got, Without offence to any. What he spendes Is his owne monie, &amp; among his friendes He will bestowe it.‚Äù I, &amp; doe soe still, Follow the swinge of thy vngoverned will, See what 'twill bring thee too; for I fore see Thy end wilbe both shame &amp; beggerie. Whom have we yonder with a pipe at 's head? He lookes as if he were true Indian bred. O, 'tis Fumoso with the tallow face, He that of late hath got a speciall grace, And that 's to be the best Tobacconist That ever held a pipe within his fist. It cost him dear enough; for the fame goes H'as smokd out all his living at his nose To purchase this rare skill. But hee 'l repaire This losse with greater wealth vnto a haire,‚Äî He has the rediest meanes this gap to stop. ‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù Why he intends to keep a shop For smoke &amp; botle-ale, which soone will drawe Good store of gallantes (even as iet doth strawe) Vnto his custome, &amp;, for greater gaine, A bonny lasse or two hee 'l entertaine. As take me e're a shop subvrbian That selles such ware, without a curtezane, And we will have the deed cronologizde, Nay it may well be now immortalizde. Doth a tobacco pipe hang before the dore, 'Tis a sure signe within ther is a whore. ‚ÄúA whore,‚Äù sayes he; ‚ÄúO, fie! you speake to broad; A punck, or else one of the dealing trade; And such a one I mean to keep, &amp; she Will help, I hope, to keep &amp; maintaine me. O, 'tis the only thriving meanes of all To rayse mans fortunes vp by womans fall.‚Äù An excellent project, follow thy designe, And thou shalt purchase a rich golden mine, And hell with all to boote;‚Äîsoe thou hast golde It makes noe matter. But perhaps being olde, One foote already within Charons bote, Thou thinkst it time enough to change thy cote To a more Christian habit, if th' intend, How vile so e're thy life have been, thine end Shalbe repentant, though thou doe deferre To the last minute, yet thou darst aver 'Twill be sufficient. From the theefe o' th' crosse Thou dost example take; God seekes the losse Of no mans soule; his Sonne he therfore gave The soules of sinners, soe we are all, to save. Thou silly sott, how well thou canst invent Against thy selfe to make an argument! Foole, Foole! Not every dying man shall enter, That saith ‚ÄúLord, Lord,‚Äù into the heavenly center Of everlasting blisse; true faith must be The only meanes to this eternity. And how doth that but by good workes appear, Good woorkes are true faiths handmaides, &amp; are dear In the Almighties eyes, though (I confesse) Not of sufficient power to release The soule from everlasting punnishment (As papistes doe persuade by argument) And purchase heaven. Godes mercy, not deserte Of mortall man, can heavenly ioyes impart. But to returne to thee which thinkst to die In the true faith, yet livst in villanie; That makst account to purchase heavenly grace At thy last hower, yet dayly sinst apace; Presumpteous slave, thy error doth deceive thee, And of those heavenly ioes will quite bereave thee! For if the truth thou doe exactly scanne, As is the life, so is the end of man. Wheras the theefs example thou dost bring, Who being ready, his last requiem sing Vpon the crosse, was in that instant hower From shamefull death to the celestiall bower Of Paradise transported; learne to know That this example was indeed to shew Gods mercy infinite, his power to save, Though man belike to drop into his grave. The vse of this we rightly may applie To comfort them whose huge iniquity Their conscience doth oppresse, &amp; make them faint, Lest black dispaire their guilty soules attaint. But as this one, so but this only one, To keep man from such damnd presumption As thou dost fall into, Godes word containes, How darst thou then presume? Wher are thy braines? How is thy iudgement from truth alienated? How is thy soule, which should be consecrated Vnto Godes service, dedicat to sinne, To such presumpteous sinne? If thou shouldst winne All thy lives precious time to clear this blot, To purge thy conscience of soe foule a spot, To wash thy sinne in true repentant teares, Yet all thy sorrowes, all thy Christian cares Are not sufficient to appease Godes wrath. Vnlesse his mercy helpe to expiate The foulnesse of thie crime; without his grace, Hell shalbe thy perpetuall dwelling place. And you rich gluttons, drunkardes, Epicures, Whom carnall sence &amp; appetite immures From God &amp; goodnesse, think not (though you live Like beastes) that you noe strict account shall give How you have spent your time, consumd'e your treasure, Livd' brutishlie in ease, delight, &amp; pleasure. Yes, for each act, for every word &amp; thought, Before Godes high tribunal being brought, You must all answeare, yet you wilbe mute, For your owne conscience will your cause confute. Then to your terrour shall that sentence be, ‚ÄúDepart ye cursed to helles miserie!‚Äù But I too long vpon this vice have staide, Ther 's something else of others to be saide. Sat[ira] 6. [AGAINST LASCIVIOUSNESS.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Vndique squalenti scelerata libidine terra Affluit, &amp; templis spargitur vsque Venus; Luxurians √¶tas l√¶na, meretrice, cin√¶do Polluitur, m≈ìhos angulus omnis alit. Having discoursd of sensuall gluttonie, It followes now I speake of venerie; For these companions as inseperable Are linckt together with sinnes ougly cable; The heart of lust 's excesse in delicates, And in this vice the soule precipitates. Lot was first drunk, &amp; in this drunken fit He that incestuous sinne did straight committ. But I leave recordes of antiquity And take me to this times iniquity. Lust, as a poyson that infects the blood, Boyles in the veines of man; the raging floud Of Neptunes kingdome, when th' impetuous might Of the fierce windes doth make it seem to fight With monstrous billowes 'gainst the loftie cloud, Is calmer then the sea of lust, though loud Vnto the eare of sence, &amp; is more safe; For this can only drowne the worser hafe Of man, the bodie; but lustes ocean O'rewhelms both soule &amp; body; yet fond man Runnes in this gulfe of sinne without all stay, And wilfully doth cast himselfe away. If ever age or nation with this crime Were beastiallie defilde, now is the time, And ours that nation, whose libidinous heat, Whose fire of brutish lust, is growne soe great That it doth threaten with proud Phaeton To give the world a new combustion. Both sexes, each degree, both young &amp; olde, Themselves vnto this filthy sinne have solde; Yea, even the tribe of Levie (which should be The mirrours of vnspotted chastety) Are slaves to lust! I speake not this alone Of Popish priestes, which make profession Of an immaculate virginity, Yet live in whoredome &amp; adultery; But alsoe to our clergie, which to blame, Preach continence, but follow not the same. And their example 's able to seduce Well given mindes vnto this knowne abuse; For euery man doth vse in imitation To follow his instructours fashion. The country parson may, as in a string, Lead the whole parish vnto any thing. Eulalius hath had good education, Pens sermons well, hath good pronuntiation, Stiflie inveighs 'gainst sinne, as gluttonie, Pride, envie, wrath, sloth, brutish lecherie, Covetousnes, &amp; such like, no man more,‚Äî Yet every man can tell he keeps a whore. Philogonous doth love his lust as well, But he would clear from all suspition dwell; 'Tis safest gutting at a loafe begunne, And therfore he his neighbour[s] wife hath wonne To be his paramour; they may suspect, But hee 's soe wary, no man can detect His close encounters. O, but heers the spite, On[e] wench cannot suffice his appetite! His first must then be baude vnto another, She to a third, the daughter to the mother, Til like the parish bull he serves them still, And dabbes their husbandes clean against their will. But he that knew him not, &amp; heard him preach, Would think it were impossible to teach Vertue with such a fervent seeming zeale, And yet thus looslie in his actions deale. You lustfull swine! that know the will of God, Yet follow your owne waies, think that his rod (For soe he saith himselfe) shall scourge your sinne With many stripes;‚Äîwith you he will beginne. The greater man, the higher is the evill He doth committ, &amp; he the viler devill. Turne convertites, &amp; make true recantation, And leave at last to act your owne damnation, Lest your reward be Godes just vengeance, And hell your portion &amp; inheritance. Sempronia 's married to a gentleman That in the joyes of Venus litle can; 'Tis very likely, &amp; you may believe her, And you, her honest neighbours, should relieve her. Saith lustfull Spurio, ‚ÄúWould she me accept, I'de pawne my head to please her e're I slept, And save the paines of suing a divorce.‚Äù Yet Messalina doth, without remorse Of conscience for the act, take to her bed A second husband ere the first be dead, With whom she lives but an adulteresse In brutish sinne &amp; sensuall beastlinesse. Pray Iove he please her well, or, though 't be strange, This second for a third I fear shee 'l change. Borgia 's in quiet, &amp; is let alone, Although his sister &amp; his whore be one; The father likewise doth (a hellish fact!) With his owne daughter cursed incest act. Who dares to let him? Hee 's a great commander, Romes triple crown√®d Pope, Sixt Alexander! Incestuous slaves! think you to scape the rod Of the Almighty sinne-revenging God? No, though the world doe wink at your offence God never will with wickednesse dispence. Sulpitia, leave at last to wrong thy spouse, Lest thou the furious sleeping lion rouse; Desist to act thy aged husbandes scorne, He hath olde plenty, give him not the horne, And I 'le not tell the world thy hatefull sinne, How full of luxury thy life hath been, How many severall lovers thou hast had, How often thou hast faind to see thy dad, That by such meanes thou mightst have free accesse To meet thy paramour. Nor will I presse Thy conscience with recitall of that ill When thou, thy letchers purse with golde to fill, Emtiedst thy husbandes bagges; the diamond ringes, The sutes of sattin, &amp; such pretty thinges, Which thou, as pledges of thy lewd desire, Gavst to thy sweetheart for his lustfull hire, I 'le not once name; no, I will hold my peace, Soe thou wilt from thy filthy lust surcease. Drugo, although thou lately didst escape The daunger of the lawe, which for a rape Awardeth death, be wise &amp; sinne noe more, Least that thou run soe much vpon the score Of wickednesse, that thou canst never pay it; And soe for want of meanes how to defraie it, By death arrested, in helles prison cast, Thou pine in torment which shall ever last. Sodomeo scorneth women; all his joy Is in a rarely featurde lively boy, With whom (I shame to speake it) in his bed He plaies like Iove with Phrigian Ganimede. Monster of men, worse then the sensuall beast! Which by instinct doth follow the behest Of nature in his kinde, but thou dost fall Into a sinne that 's moste vnnaturall. Degenerate bastard! by some devill got, For man could never, sure, beget a spot Of such vncleannesse; how dost dare enact Soe damnd a crime, soe lewde a loathsome fact? Dost thou not fear that iust Iove, in his ire, Will raine downe brimstone &amp; consuming fire; As in his wrath, though many ages since, He did one Sodome, whose concupiscence, Like thine, deservde black helles damnation? Or that some fearfull invndation In his swift streame, should hurry thee to hell, With damn√®d fiendes &amp; torturde ghoastes to dwell? Methinks such thoughts as these should purge thy soule, And keep thy bodie from an act so foule. But 'tis noe marvell though thou be not free From the contagion of this villanie, When the whole land 's thus plagued with this sore, Whose beastlinesse then now was never more: In Academie, country, citty, Courte, Infinite are defiled with this spurt. O, grant, my dearest nourse, from whose full brest I have suckt all (if ought I have) that 's best, Suffer me to condole the misery Which thou gronst vnder by this villanie! How many towardly young gentlemen (Instead of ink, with teares I fill my pen To write it) sent vnto thee by theyr friendes For art &amp; education, the true endes Their parentes aime at, are with this infection Poysned by them whose best protection Should keep them from all sinne! Alacke the while! Each pedant Tutour should his pupill spoile. O, how I grieve at this vnhappy fate, Because this vice is soe inveterate, Growne to so strong a custome that (I fear) The world shall end ere they this sinne forbear! But I leave thee with my best exoration For thy moste speedy &amp; true reformation. Nothus which came into the world by chaunce At a bye window, hath been late in France, Yet never crost the seas, it cannot bee; 'Tis newes that passes our capacity! 'Tis soe, &amp; by th' event I wilbe tride, For I am sure hee 's hugely Frenchifide, Gallicus morbus is his owne, I swear, He has it paide him home vnto a haire. Pitty him they that list, soe will not I, Hee 's iustly plagud for his damnd luxurie, He might have keapt his whore-house-haunting feet Out of Picthatch, the Spitle, Turnboll street; He might, forewarnd, have left his pockie drabbes, They must have veriuice that will squeese such crabbes. But he had cause to love a puncke the more, Because his mother was an arrant whore. I cannot chuse but grieve at the mishap Of Cloudia, which of late hath caught a clap. Alack, poore wench! the trust of promisde marriage Hath loded thee with an vnvsuall carriadge. Take comfort lasse, &amp; I a time will spie To shew thy lover his discourtesie, And though he have thee in this sort beguilde, He shall give somewhat to bring vp the childe; A litle mony from the law will quite thee, Fee but the Sumner, &amp; he shall not cite thee; Or if he doe, only for fashion sake, The lawe of thee shall no advantage take. And though due pennance thou deservst to doe For tredding thus awry thy slippery shoe, Be not dismaide at all; if thou dost flow In thy frank guiftes, &amp; thy golde freely stow, The principall will make thy pennance ebbe. The Comissaries court 's a spiders webbe, That doth entangle all the lesser flies, But the great ones break through; it never ties Them in his circling net. Wher golde makes way Ther is no interruption, noe delay Can hinder his proceeding; therfore, wench, Thou maist with a bolde face confront the bench. If thy forerunners bribes have made thy peace, Thy shame shall vanish, but thy sinne encrease, And when thou once hast scap√®d this annoy, Goe to it roundly for another boy; Lose not an inch of pleasure, though thou gaine, For momentarie ioyes, eternall paine. But yet be sure, if thou still goe about To play the drab, my pen shall paint thee out, And thy lewde actes vpon thy forehead score, That all the world may note thee for a whore. O Linceus, that I had thy searching eye! Then would I in each secret corner prie, To finde the hidden knaveries of this age, And lay them open to this paper stage. Then Glabria should not, with her wanton eye, Allure faire Quintus to her villanie, But I would straight detect her for the crime, And hinder their appoynted meeting time. Then Lusco, 'cause his wife 's in years decaide, Should not entise to ill her waiting maide, But I would spie them out, &amp; note them downe, To her discredit &amp; his smale renowne. Then Scilla, 'cause she might without suspect Play the lewd harlot, &amp; none might detect Her lustfull conversation, should not hide Her loosnesse in a masculine outside, But with my pen I soone would her vncase, And lay her open to noe mean disgrace. Then Galla, that insatiate citty dame, (Which loves a player, 'cause he hath the fame Of a rare Actour, &amp; doth in his part Conquer huge giantes, &amp; captive the hart Of amarous ladies) should not him intice, Prone (as all players are) vnto this vice, With goodlie presentes. I their match would lett, Or catch them sleeping in a Vulcanes nett, And having caught them to the world display How lusty Mars with lustfull Venus lay. Then lustfull Iove, what shape soe e're he tooke Should not deceive mine eye, nor scape my booke. Thy lust Pasiphae I 'de sett to th' full, Whose bestiall appetite desirde a bull. Mirrha, thou shouldst not scape, that didst desire, To make thy father to thy childe a sire. But since I cannot, as I would, be fitted, Let me detect what I have knowne committed. It was my fortune, with some others moe, On[e] summers day a progresse for to goe Into the countrie, as the time of year Required, to make merrie with good cheer. Imagine Islington to be the place, The jorney to eat cream. Vnder the face Of these lewd meetings, on set purpose fitted, Much villanie is howerly committed. But to proceed; some thought there would not be Good mirth without faire wenches companie, And therfore had provided, a forehand, Of wiues &amp; maides a iust proportiond band In number to the men of vs; each on[e] Might have his wench vnto himselfe alone. I that, till afterwardes, not comprehended Whereto this meeting chieflie was intended, But thought indeed the only true intent To spend the time in honest merriment,‚Äî Went 'mongst the thickest, &amp; had intercourse In many a mad &amp; sensuall discourse. Among the women kinde a wife ther was, Her name I could not learne, I therfore passe It over; but a fain√®d one to frame, Call her Veneria, that 's the fittest name. This wife, which with the maides did holde her walke, I chanc'd to overhear in her lewde talke, How she did them by argumentes perswade To vse the pleasure of the common trade, I will repeat, that you may iudge with me, Women moste prone to filthy luxurie. ‚ÄúMy friendes,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúfirst, all of you must knowe, Good things more common doe the better grow; For 'tis an axiome in morality, Which you must all believe for verity. If, then, community doe goodnesse adde To actions that are good, who 'd be so mad To lose the vertue of this common good When 't may be purchasde without losse of blood? For that 'tis good, I think you'l not deny, Or if you doe, then thus I doe replie:‚Äî To doe our friend a pleasur 's a good deed, If it be done for love, &amp; not for meed; To doe an act that addes to our delight Is it not good? what foole will once deny't? Besides, the name importes it to be good, For we a good turne call it. With my blood, If all this be to weake, I will maintaine Ther's none of all our sexe that would refraine To vse the pleasure of this knowne delight, If fear did not restraine their appetite. And this I holde, that secret letcherie Is a lesse sinne then close hypocrisie. A preacher tolde me that the action wrought (Because more seldome then the wandring thought) Is not soe great a fault, soe we chuse time And place convenient to conceile our crime; And that we will not want, nor lusty boyes Able to give a wench her fill of ioyes. Then to it, lasses, when you have desire, 'Tis dangerous to suppresse a flaming fire!‚Äù To hear this lewdnesse both mine eares did glow, But I bit in my tongue, lest there should grow Some discontentment 'mongst them by my speach, Which happily might have procur'de a breach Among vs; &amp; indeed soe much the rather, Because by circumstances I did gather Wherfore this meeting was, &amp; did intend to observe all vnto the very end. By this time we th' appointed place attainde, Where straight with welcomes we were entertaind. Musicke was sent for, &amp; good chear preparde, With which more like to Epicures we farde Then Christianes; plenty of wine &amp; creame Did even vpon our table seeme to streame, With other dainties. Not a fidlers boy But with the relicks of our feast did cloy His hungry stomach. After this repast (Which feast with many a baudy song was gracd) Some fell to dauncing (&amp; dauncing is a cause That many vnto fornication drawes), In which lascivious kinde of merriment, Till the darke evening did approch, we spent The lightsome day. But now the time drew nigh That was comprisd'e to act their villany; And therfore after candles were brought in (For then the night grew on) we did beginne The fidlers to discharge, who being gone, There straight was held a consultation, In which, when each man had his wench assignde, The filthinesse of this lewde act to blinde With darkenesse, all the candles were put out, Which favouring my intent, I left the rout, And closely stole away, having defraide A great part of the reckning; which I paide Whilst they were all full busie in the darke, Because they should not think I came to sharke Only for vittailes. How the rest agreed, Iudge you which doe this true narration read. But leaving this mad crew, I have to say Somewhat of bawdes, cheife actours in this play. Gabrina, in her youth a pretty ducke, Hath been, they say, as good as ever strucke. It was her fortune (long she could not tarry 'Cause she was faire) with a rich foole to marrie. I call him foole, because he let her have Her minde soe much, that he became her slave To his vndooing. She must keep her coach, Consort with ladies; each new set abroach Fantastique fashion which she did affect, His gold must flie for; yet she did respect Others above him, vpon whom she spent His wealth; her lust his care could not prevent. Thus soone her pride &amp; sensuality Brought him vnto disgrace &amp; beggery, Till griefe for her lewd life, his ruind state Broke his weak heart, &amp; made him yeild to fate. Then was she glad her whores flag to advaunce, And get her living by a Scottish daunce. Thus with her sister, such another piece, Many a gallant of his golde they fleece. Now ceazd with age, &amp; both of them turnd bawdes, Olde hackny women, they hire out their jades, A crew of whores far worse then crocodiles, Killing with fain√®d teares &amp; forg√®d smiles. Confusion with their fortunes ever dwell, That keep the dores that ope to sinne &amp; hell! These bawdes which doe inhabite Troynovant, And iet it vp &amp; downe i' th' streetes, aflaunt In the best fashion, thus vpholde their state, As I haue heard a friend of mine relate, Who once in privat manner with another Went purposly their fashions to discover. They doe retaine besides these common queanes, Even mens wives which are of greatest meanes, That yearly pay them tribute for their lust, Vpon whose secrecie they doe entrust Their blotted reputation, for which pleasure They lewdly doe consume their husbandes treasure. The custome of these bawdes is thus: if any Repaire vnto them (as God knowes too many Run to this sinck of sinne), at the first view To shew their cheapest ware; if they will glue Their slimy bodies to those common whores, The bawdes proceed no farther, keep the dores, The price paide, which repentaunce findes to dear, And the act done, doe straight the men cashier. But if some gallant, whose out side doth holde Great expectation that good store of golde Will from his bounty shower into their lappes, Come to demaund (for soe it often happes) To see their choysest beauties, him they bring (After request [not] to say any thing) Into a privat roome, which round about Is hung with pictures; all which goodly rout Is fram'de of Venus fashion, femals all, Whom if I name whores, I noe whit miscall, For soe they are, whom these doe represent. All citty dames, which vsually frequent This cursed place, who, though they goe full brave, Are in their lust insatiat as the grave. That picture which doth best affect the eye Of this luxurious gallant, instantly Is by some traine brought thether in true shape Of lively substance. Then good Bacchus grape Flowes in abundance; Ceres must be by, For without them ther is noe venerie. Provocatives to stir vp appetite To brutish lust &amp; sensuall delight, Must not be wanting; lobsters buttered thighs, Hartichoke, marrowbone, potato pies, Anchoves, lambes artificiallie drest stones, Fine gellies of decocted sparrowes bones. Or if these faile, th' apothecaries trade Must furnish them with rarest marmalade, Candid eringoes, &amp; rich marchpaine stuffe; Vpon which cates ther is consumde enough To give sufficient to a hundred men, Spent but on ordinarie fare. But then These dainties must be washd downe well with wine, With sacke &amp; sugar, egges &amp; muskadine, With Allegant, the blood of Venerie, That strengthens much the backes infirmity. Abundance of these dainties they 'l not lacke, Although it make my gallantes purstrings cracke. And yet sometimes these cittie dames will spend As if their husbandes wealth could ne're have end. Then after this libidinous collation They doe proceed to act their owne damnation. Thus is the worthiest citty of our land Made a base brothel-house, by a lewde band Of shamelesse strumpets, whose vncurb√®d swing Many poore soules vnto confusion bring. You magistrates, which holde Astr√¶as sword, For countries cause joyne all with one accord To clear the citty of this cursed crew, Least the whole land the noysomenesse doe rewe Of their contagion. For the better health Of the whole body of the commonwealth, Cut of these rotten members, &amp; beginne First at the head of this notorious sinne. For this is written one the Lidian stone, ‚ÄúThe effect doth perish when the cause is gone.‚Äù These bawdes &amp; panders which doe give receat (Being indeed the meanes wherby they eat) To whores &amp; ruffians, whose damnd villanie Doth purchase gold &amp; sell iniquity; Were they expeld the cittie, ther would grow More continence, for them these heades doe flow; The springs of lust, these fountaines, being drawne dry The lesser streames would stint immediatly. Lop of these vlcerd members of our land, These putrifi√®d members; with the hand Of iustice chase hence this vngodly rout,‚Äî Subtract the fewell &amp; the fire goes out,‚Äî And let our land this damn√®d devillish crew, As excrementes, out of her bosome spewe; And then you manifestly shall perceave The greater part their brutish lust will leave. For every man this olde saide saw beleeves, ‚ÄúWere no receivers there would be no theeves.‚Äù Thus City scapes not, nor the Court is free From obsceane actes of hatefull luxurie. Those men or women that doe make resorte, In hope of gaine or honour, to the Court, Doe live soe idely, &amp; in such excesse, That it must needs produce this wickednesse. Vitellius hath gotten a good place, And might live well i' th' Court, had he the grace To keep it to good endes, &amp; vse it soe, ‚ÄúBut lightly come,‚Äù we say, ‚Äúdoth lightly goe.‚Äù It cost him nothing but a supple knee, And oyly mouth &amp; much observancie, But he doth vpon worse then nothing spend it, Yet 'tis well spent, he saies, &amp; hee 'l defend it. He keeps a whore i' th' city, what needs that? Ther 's whores enough i' th' Court, which (as a cat Waites to supprise a mouse) watch to espie Whom they can draw vnto their villanie, Some for meer lust, others for greedinesse Of gaine; as, 'mongst all your court landresses If but one honest woman can be found, I 'le give her leave to give me twenty pound. But these are stale; Vitellius must have one That 's a rare piece of the best fashion, Although she make these three thinges fare the worse, His soule, his body, &amp; his strouting purse. His purse, her gay apparel &amp; fine fare Have made allready very thin &amp; bare; His bodie, her vnwholsome luxurie Hath brought to the disease of venery; And I much fear this their lewde fashion Will bring his soule vnto damnation. Silvius doth shew the citty dames brave sights, And they for that doe pleasure him a nightes. Citty &amp; country are beholding to him, And glad with purse &amp; body both to woe him. But what talke I of these, when brighter starres Darken their splendant beauty with the scarres Of this insatiate sinne? If honour fall Gentry must needes submit himselfe a thrall. But whether climst thou, my aspiring Muse? It wilbe thought presumption &amp; abuse To taxe nobility! Forbear, forbear! Thou art an orbe above thy native spheare, Something thou canst not in oblivion drowne;‚Äî Why come one then, &amp; briefly set it downe. I heard Brusano by his honour sweare He on[e] &amp; fifty cuckoldes made last yeare. Pitty it was he did noe farther goe, Each weeke would have done well to struck a doe, And given the keeper his due fee to seeke When as he came to th' two &amp; fiftith weeke. Whom shall we finde to make vp the iust number? To bring 't about it my conceit doth cumber. Why, what a foole am I to seek thus farre! You did soe many cuckoldes make or marre? Well then, i' faith you may, for all your pelfe, Make vp the two &amp; fiftieth your selfe! Madame Emilia hath a proper squire To vsher her vnto the filthy mire Of soule-polluting lust, who knowes his cues Wher he must leave her, where attendance vse; And can while 's lady actes the horrid crime, With picking rushes trifle out the time; And for a need, when she wantes fresh supplie, Her sensuall desires satisfie. Base slave! which standest centinell to lust, Suffering thy soule, polluted with the rust Of canckered sinne, by thy neglect to perish, Which above all thinges thou shouldst love &amp; cherish! Thou instrument of sinne &amp; Sathans rage! Incarnate devill! pandarizing page! Be sure (vnlesse repentance pardon gaine) There doth a place in hell for thee remaine. And for those lechers which will never linne (Accounting lust but as a veniall sinne) To committ incest, whoredome, sodomie, Defile the land with damnd adulterie, Which strive not to suppresse their lewde desires, But fewell ad to their lust-burning fires, By seeking wicked opportunities To act their damnable iniquities, Till they have ruind all their hope of blisse, Devilles will hale them to helles darke abisse. Sat[ira] 7. [AGAINST THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND.]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Argumentum. Reginam mentis rationem, serva rebellis Passio devincit, calce tyranna premit, Dum gerit immodicos (victa ratione) trivmphos, Incautos homines, ad mala damna rapit. God gave to man a reasonable soule, That he might govern vnder his controle All other creatures in the world beside, Yet man wantes reason how himselfe to guide. Reason, the soules queen, whose imperious sway Should rule the microcosme of man, &amp; stay By her wise governing authority Each insolent affections tyranny, Is through much, too much, sufferaunce become Slave to her subiect, who vsurps her roome. Ambitiously aspiring passion, Ever delighting in rebellion, Collects her forces, meets her prince i' th' field, Subdues her power in conflict, make[s] her yeild. And now the tyrannesse beares all the stroke, Clogging her suffering neck with servile yoke, And proud insulting in her victorie, Trivmphs o're mans base imbecillity. Thus his owne servant, every base affection, Keeps him in slavish t[h]raldome &amp; subjection. By love or hatred, by ioy, griefe, or feare, Desire, boldenesse, anger, hope, dispaire, Man is enthrald, &amp; doth submitt his will Their tyrannies &amp; pleasures to fulfill. The Amoretto, pearc'd with Cupides stroke, Must straight submitt his neck vnto the yoke Of peevish love. Either his mistrisse haire, Or else her forehead is beyond compare; Her eyes are starres, &amp; her cheekes roses be, Her lips pure rubies, her teeth ivorie, Her breath perfume, her voice sweet harmonie Passing Threician Orpheus melody; The path between her brestes a whiter way Then that celestiall via lactea; Her veines pure azure, o? what colour 's best, Her skin sleek sattin or the cygnettes brest; A Venus in whom all good partes doe hitt, More then a second Pallas in her witt; In stately pace and dazeling maiestie, Another Iuno; in pure chastety Spotlesse Diana. Thus is all her feature Beyond the fashion of a humane creature. Then what ‚Äúay mees!‚Äù what crossing of his armes, What sighs, what teares, what love-compelling charmes He vseth, would enforce a sicke man smile! Yet all the paines he takes is to beguile His sillie soule; for having once enioyed The thing, for which he erst was soe anoyde, The tide is turnd, the saint doth seem a devill, And he repentes that soule-bewitching evill Which once his fancy as a good adorde;‚Äî His mistresse love, I mean, is now abhorde. Anothers minde by hate distempered is, Malicing whom in shew he seemes to kisse. This base affection causeth dismall strife, Despoileth honour, &amp; destroyeth life. Yet in these dayes 'tis counted pollicie To vse dissimulation; villanie Masqu'd vnder friendships title (worst of hate) Makes a man liue secure &amp; fortunate. These Machiavillians are the men alone That thrive i' th' world, &amp; gett promotion. Athenian Timon, in his hatefull moode, Was ne're soe bad as some of this damnde broode, This brood of Caines, these dissembling knaves, These mankinde-haters, bloody minded slaves, Which all the world with horrid murders fill, Laughing one those whom they intend to kill. A third ther is, which gaining some vaine toy, Is overwhelm√®d through excessive ioy. The husbandman, if that his crops proove well, Hath his heart fild with joy 'cause his barnes swell; The marchant, if his gaines doe safe come in, Is with ioy ready to leape out on 's skinne; The vehemency of this passion 's such, Many have died by joying overmuch. Another, shuning comfort &amp; reliefe, Suffers himselfe to be subchargde with griefe, And soe this passion doth his reason blinde That it begettes a frenzie in his minde. Another, if that fear doe him assaile, Doth suffer that affection to prevaile, And doth bring him [in]to such franticke fittes, As you would judge him to be out on 's wittes. Each bush doth fright him, &amp; each flying bird, Yea his owne shadowe maketh him afeard. Desire in others sheweth forth his mighte, Making them follow brutish appetite. Desire of honour fires th' ambitious minde; Desire of wealth the covetous doth blinde; The lecher cannot lustfull thoughtes withstand: Reason 's controlde by passions that commaund. Another, rash &amp; indiscreetly bolde, Hazardes himselfe in dangers manifolde, Yet thinks himselfe (mislead by his temerity) To vse true valour &amp; dexterity; When folly his companion is assignde, For ‚Äúwho soe bolde as bayard that is blynde? With rashnesse is conioyn√®d impudence, With which my Muse in noe case can dispence. His talke is bawdry, he doth rather choose His soule then a prophane conceite to loose. Mischiefe-procurer anger rules another, That knowes not friend from foe; stranger or brother, All 's one to him; for in his bedlem fitt, Which quite deprives him of his litle witt, He cares not whom he strikes, or what vile wordes That cutt like razors, or sharp edg√®d swordes, Flie from his hasty tongue. This passion swaies And rules over too many now adayes, For each vaine toy stirreth vp man to furie, When he in patience greatest wrongs should burie. Hope &amp; affection is that doth least harme Vnto the soule of man; for it doth arme With constancy in trouble to endure The worst of evill that sad fates procure. It makes the prisoner, bound in gives of steele, In expectation of release, to feele Noe torment in his bondage; cures the sicke Of his diseases; makes the halfe dead quicke. Yet is this good conioyn√®d with some evill; To hope on God is good, but from the devill To expect healp, as they doe which attend With expectation of a happy end To some ill act, is diabolicall, And not by Christians to be vsde at all. But when I come to think vpon dispaire (Which to withstand the rediest meanes is praier) I muse to think it should soe much bewitch The minde of man, making the soule (like pitch) Commit such deeds of darkenesse, such damnd ill, As with our owne handes our owne lives to spill. Farre be it from me all passion to exclude Out of mans soule, my meaning 's not so rude; For 'tis an axiome not to be withstood, ‚ÄúHe that is void of passion 's voide of good.‚Äù Love of that love deserving Diety, Which doth produce effectes of charity, And kindles in mans heart devotion, Once to extenuate were a sinfull motion Of a pestiferous braine; noe, I desire To ad more fewell to that holy fire. Nor can I but commend of godlie hate, Detesting sinne, that doth commaculate The soule of man; this passion 's worth commending, That hates the offence, yet loves the man offending. Neither will I restraine the heart from joy Soe that with moderation we imploy This passion to good vses; hartes rejoyce, But let the cause be singuler &amp; choice. Grief likewise must abounde in every man That will indeed be a true Christian, Sorrow the badge of true repentance weares, Sinne must be purgde by a whole flood of teares. To filial feare I likewise doe assent, That 's awd from sinne by love, not punishment. Salvations hope, celestiall ioyes desire, Vertuous boldenesse, with religious ire, Are heavenly passions not to be denide, But as occasion serves, to be applide To their true endes. Affectiones of such kinde Mie Muse disclaimes not; but all such as blinde The eyes of reason, &amp; doe quite pervert The soule, mans better intellectuall part, That keep him from the path of his salvation, And lead the way which brings vnto damnation, These, these they be, on which I doe engage My vex√®d Muse to wreck her spleenfull rage. Philautus with his very soule doth love A wench as faire as Venus milck white dove; He loves his hunting-horse, his hauke, his hound, His meat &amp; drink, his morning sleeps profound; He loves to follow each new-fangled fashion, He loves to hear men speake his commendation, He loves his landes, that bring him store of pelfe, But above all thinges he doth love himselfe. In all this love noe love of God I finde, Noe love of goodnesse, but a love confinde To sensuall delights, to sinne &amp; ease, A love to others soe himselfe to please. Thou impious worldling, leave this vaine affection, Which only on thy selfe hath a reflection; This sinne relinquish, lest incens√®d Iove Doe iustly plague thy misapply√®d love. I saw (a sight that made me much affraide) Amorphus kisse his mothers kitchin-maide. Me thought as both their heades together came, I saw the devill kissing of his dam: And yet this foole 's in love with her 'bove measure, Calls her the mistresse of his ioy &amp; pleasure; Sweares that faire roses grow vpon her cheekes, When I'le be sworne 'tis fitter place for leekes; Saies her sweet breath his amarous fires increase, When she smelles filthy strong of durt &amp; grease. ‚ÄúBut like to like, the collier &amp; the devill,‚Äù He &amp; his wench; she stammers, he doth drivell; He squints, &amp; she doth gogle wondrous faire; His botle-nose is red, soe is her haire; She hath a crooked backe, he a polte foote; His face is blacke, &amp; hers begrimd'e with soote; A loving lovely couple most divine, Pitty it were that they should not combine. Pamphila is in love with every man That comes within her sight, &amp; if she can Will prostitute her body to his will, And never leave till she her lust fullfill. Stepmother Ph≈ìdra woos her husbandes sonne, Hypolitus, but he with care doth shunne Her odious lust, loathing a sinne soe vile As his sires bed with incest to defile; But still she sues, &amp; still he doth denie, Till vrgde to farre, he doth her presence flie. Lust thus by verteous chastetie withstood Is turnd to hate, &amp; hate thirsts after blood; And his hartes blood it is this thirst must ease; Only his death can her fell hate appease. True Machiavillian C√¶cilius With hate doth prosecute Honorius, Because his vertues did deserve more love, And he i' th' Court respected was above His high aspiring selfe. Yet till the end In outward shew he seemd to be his friend. But when that Fortune had once turnd her wheele He was the first that did his furie feele; For then his rage burst forth, &amp; it is thought This one mans hate his sad destruction wrought. Misotochus (which his hand will sooner lend To bring his neighbour to vntimely end Then save his life) hath horded vp his corne, Ready to burst his garners with the horne Of his aboundance, &amp; doth hope his seed Kept from the market will a famine breed; And therfore will not sell a graine this year, Nor to sustaine his householde thresh an eare; But lives one rootes like a Diogenes, With poor thin drink, &amp; course bread mad[e] of pease. What though the poore doe want, begge, starve, &amp; dye, They get from him noe healp in miserie. Their hunger feeds him fat, he ioyes to see Their death-procuring sad calamity. Thou hateful cynick-dog, belov'd of none, Because none loving, not thy selfe alone! Inhuman devill! think some fatall hower Will bring huge troupes of vermine, to devoure Thy graine &amp; thee; or that from heaven will fall Consuming fyer &amp; destroy it all. Looke for some fearfull vengeance to be sent, Some plague vnheard of, some straunge punnishment; For such damnd hatred, iust revenging God Will scourge thy sinne with some vnusuall rodde. N√¶nius hath with much officious labour Recover√®d his mistrisses lost favour, For the which act the foole 's soe overioyde That through excesse therof he is annoide. When she vouchsafte that he might kiss her hand, The asse had much adoe on 's feet to stand, He was soe inly ravisht with delight Of that rare pleasure: such another fight Twixt reason &amp; his passion would have sent A foolish soule to Plutoes regiment. When Carthaginian Hanniball, that stout And politicke captaine, which soe often fought With Roman Consuls in their native soile, And their best forces many times did foile, It is recorded by cronologers And excellent histriographers, In that vnluckie Cannas overthrowe, When few or none escapte deaths fatall blowe, A certaine woman dwelling then at Rome Heard her two sonnes had their eternall doome; For which (as nature would) she did lament, Her eyes (bare witnesse) all with teares besprent. But the young men scaping by flight their foe Recover Rome &amp; to their mother goe; She hearing both alive return√®d were And bid her former sorrow to forbeare, Will not beleeve reporte, but trust her eyes, When sodainly opprest with ioy she dies. Mopsa, they say, o'recome with joy lies dead, But how? i' th' act of her lost mayden head! A fearfull end, to die in act of sinne, And in this death a second death beginne, A dayly living death, yet dying paine Which shall in perpetuity remaine. Luctantia, cease thy lamentation! Thou mone'st thy puppies death with greater passion Then the offences that thou dost committe 'Gainst thy Creatour; which iust ne're a whit Grieve thy seard conscience; noe remorse for sinne On[e] tear enforceth, but for every pinne, For every trifle else, that doth distast Thy foolish liking, thou dost even wast Thy selfe in sorrow. Wash thy blubbered eyes, And cry no more for shame! If thou be wise See that hence forth thou keep thy fludgates dry, And weep for nothing but iniquity. Mutius, why art thou thus opprest with griefe? Take comfort man, &amp; thou shalt finde reliefe; Be not dejected, bear a constant minde: What though the tempest of an [a]dverse winde Hath blowne thy fortunes downe, ruind thy state? Wilt thou for this accuse the god of fate, And yeild to sorrow? Doe not soe; beware, 'Twas mercy in him then thy life to spare. When he destroide thy goods, had 't been his pleasure He might have ruinde thee &amp; them together. But now thy substaunce &amp; thy wealth is lost, Thou art vndone, &amp; all thy hopes are crost; Ther is noe meanes to rise: who once doth fall Is still kept downe, &amp; cannot climbe at all. Fear not, Ant√¶us more couragious grew, And by his fall did still his strength renew. Be thou like him; may be this misery Was pre-ordainde for thy felicity. Grieve not at all, ther 's blessing still in store, And he that tooke thy goodes can give thee more. Ther 's three ill feares (to one good filiall) A worldly, servile, &amp; a naturall: A wordly feare is when some worldly gaine Makes vs doe evill, or from good abstaine; When for our proffit, pleasure, &amp; our ease, We doe not good, but men fear to displease. There is a worldly fear, a fear to lacke Things necessary for the maw or backe, Which hath in nature greater confidence, Then in Gods all-foreseeing providence. Naturall fear is a distraction Of mind &amp; senses, by th' iniection Of some moste eminent danger; &amp; this passion Is great where faith doth want his operation. A servile fear 's a fear of punnishment Vnto the reprobate coincident, Whom oftentimes vnto good actes doth drawe, Not fear of God, but fear of humane lawe. Letia doth fear to play the whore with any, And yet she loves the sport as well as many That act the sinne; what hinders her intent? O she's afraide of shame &amp; punnishment. Irus is poore, yet feares to play the theefe, And yet his fingers itch to get reliefe, ‚ÄúBut the burnt childe (we say) doth dread the fire;‚Äù‚Äî Hee 's burnt i' th' hand, the next is halters hire. Romanus keeps his monthly residence At church, although against his conscience; He would refraine (because he doth abhor it) But that he feares to be presented for it. Bellina, tost in a tempestuous sea, Fears drowning much, &amp; fear doth make her pray. And yet her prayers, which doe seeme profounde, Are but lip-labour &amp; a hollow sound; For set a shore, vnlesse apparent evill Affright her much, she fears nor God nor devill. Phorbus, what makes thee looke soe like a ghoast? Thy face is pale, thy sences are quite lost, Thy haire vpon thy head doth stand vpright As if thou hadst been haunted with a spright. Why soe thou hast, thou thinkst; what, hast thou soe? How scapdst thou from him? would he let thee goe? Sure 'twas a very honest devill, friend, Wer he hobgoblin, fairie, elve, or fiend. Thou fearfull idiot! looke, it was a catt, That frights thee thus, I sawe her wher she satt; But thou with conscience guilty of much evill Dost deeme the cat to be a very devill. Caligula, creepst vnderneath thy bed? That 's a poore shelter to defend thy head 'Gainst Ioves feard thunderbolte; huge Atlas hill Cannot preserve thee, when he meanes to kill. Votarius wisheth for a great estate, And saith the poore should then participate Of all his blessings; yet doth nothing give Although he be exceeding well to live, And might healp others, till his substaunce grew; But the olde proverbe is exceeding true, ‚ÄúThat these great wishers, &amp; these common woulders, Are never (for the moste part) good householders.‚Äù Timophila her part of heaven would sell To be a ladie, she so much doth swell With this ambitious longing, to be cald Madam at every word; to be enstalde In such a chaire of state, were heaven it selfe. Ambitious woman, high aspiring elfe! All thy desires are wicked, thou vnblest, Vnlesse Godes Spirit, working in thy brest, Change thy desire from vaine &amp; earthly toies To covet truely after heavenly ioyes. Chremes is troubled with the greedy minde Of golde-desiring Midas; he doth finde Noe comfort but in gaping after gaine. Would to his wish awarded were the paine That Midas felt; who, thirsting after golde, Wishd that what e're he touchd might change the mould Into that purer mettall. Ph≈ìbus graunt Comfirmd the misers wish, but soone did daunt The wretches minde; for all the foode he tooke To comfort nature, cleane his forme forsooke And turnd to golde. The asse had surely starvde Had not Apolloes power his life preservde By taking of his wish. May the intent Of Chremes meet with the like punnishment; Or, since that Midas greedy minde he beares, May he with Midas wear the asses eares. Dame Polupragma, gossip Title-tatle, Suffers her tongue, let loose at randome, pratle Of all occurrentes; comes to publike feastes Without invitement, 'mongst the worthiest guestes Takes vp her roome at table, where, more bolde Then truely welcome, she discourse will holde Of state affaires, talke of divinity As moves the hearers to deride her folly, But grieves me to the heart, that thinges soe holy, Things which in greatest estimation stand, Should by her foolish lips be soe prophande. But Betterice let me thee this lesson teach, To leave those thinges that are above thy reach. Temerus, which i' th' warre had borne a launce, Vpon some great exploite would needes advaunce His high attempting minde, &amp; doe some act, To make the world applaud his worthy fact. Then (ne're regarding what might him befall) He takes in hand to kill the generall Of the foes armie; but his vaine intent Met with as ill successe; care did prevent His desperate boldenesse, ere he could come nigh His wish√®d end; for, taken for a spie, And brought to th' racke, torture did him compell The truth of his straunge stratagem to tell; For which the wretch in horrid torment lies, Being iustly plagu'de for his rash enterprise. Anaidus, art soe clean devoide of grace? Hast thou soe impudent a brasen face, Not only to act sinne with greedinesse, But to make boast of thy damnde wickednesse? Was 't not enough with wordes to have beguild Thy mothers maide &amp; gotten her with childe, But that thou must most shamefully beginne To make a iest of this thy hellish sinne 'Mongst thy companions? Thou perhaps dost think, Because thy law-perverting curs√®d chink Hath freed thee from the standing in a sheet (A punnishment for thy offence moste meet) That there remaines noe more? Yes, ymp of hell, There is a Iudge which in the heavens doth dwell, An vncorrupted Iudge, that will award Damnation for thy sinne, vnlesse regard Of that vnhappy state wherin thou art, Softning (I fear) thy vnrelenting heart, Shew thee thy soules deformity, &amp; in Repentaunce fountaine make thee purge thy sinne. Looke vpon Adrus in his furious ire! He seemes to burne like some red cole of fire; How his eyes flame! how his limbs shake with rage! How his voice thunders, as he ment to wage Warre against heaven! Surely the cause is great That makes him in this sort himselfe forget; It cannot but be matter of much consequence, That moves the man to this impatience? Faith no, you are deceivde; the cause was smale, A better man then he would put vp all, Were the disgrace more hainous, which is none But that his cholericke humour makes it one. This asse (which for the wagging of a straw His dagger vpon any man will drawe) Walking i' th' street, was iustled from the wall Downe almost to the channell; this is all That puttes him in this fume! Would you surmise, A man that hath the vse of reasons eyes To guide himselfe, should for a cause soe light, Soe smale a matter, be in such a plight? Ready to frett himselfe to death, to sweare, To curse, &amp; banne, as if [he] meant to teare The earth in sunder, only for this end, Because he knowes not vpon whom to bend The furie of his rage! Thou irefull foole! Vse henceforth to frequent the learned schoole Of sacred vertue, which will thee inspire With patience to moderat thine ire. Good Mistriss Orgia, holde your hasty handes! Because your maides have not pind in your bandes According to your minde, must the stick flie About their shoulders straight? Should they replie In your owne language to you, you were servde According as your rage had well deservde. But this is nothing with this furious dame, Ther 's other matters that deserve more blame. She will not stick to breake her husbandes head, Revile him to his face &amp; wish him dead In most reproachfull manner; he, good man, Dares not replie a worde, but gettes him gone Till her fit 's past, &amp; doth with patience Endure his wives outragious insolence. Thou furious vixen, learne to rule thy passion, And vse thy husband in a better fashion, Or I will have thy name to be enrolde For a moste shamelesse &amp; notorious scolde! Manlius hath a very mean estate, Yet lives in longing hope of better fate; He hath an vnkle above measure rich, And cares not much if he lay dead i' th' ditch; Hopes he cannot last long because hee 's olde; And then he hopes to seaze vpon his golde. Foole, how dost know that thou shalt him outlive? 'Twere better for thee, did he something give Now while thy wanttes desire reliefe; ‚Äúone thrush I' th' hand is worth more then are two i' th' bush;‚Äù And ‚Äúhe that hopes to put one dead mens shoos, It often comes to passe he barefoote goes.‚Äù Elpinas, which with seas doth traffique holde, Hath made a ship out for West Indian golde, And all his hopes doe in this venture lie: Should she miscarry sure the man would die; But hope, which holds him like a violent fever, Flatters him still he shalbe made for ever At her returne; &amp; since she first began To cut the billowes of the ocean With her swift keel, his minde, more swift then she, Followes her in the voyage, &amp; doth see With eyes of selfe-delighting fantasie (Which sometime wrap him in an extasie) Her prosperous traffique. If the day be faire He hopes that homeward she doth then repaire; If stormes obscure the brightnesse of the skie, He hopes she doth in safest harbour lie. The time which slowlie seemes to passe away Vnto his longing hopes, he day by day Telles o're in minutes; not a puffe of winde Blowes, but that straight his advantageous minde Carries it to his ship. Sometime his thought Runnes on the gold wherwith his ship is fraught, Imagining in his still working braine, How to imploy it to his best of gaine. Thou greedy minded slave! whose hopes are fixd Only on wealth, with pleasure inte[r]mixt, And ne're hop'st after heaven, how canst thou thinke But that iust Iove should in the ocean sinke All thy fond hopes, &amp; drive thee to dispaire, Which ne're implorst his ayde by hearty praier? Returne at last, and fix thy hopes one him, Whose only power can make thee sink or swimme. Alston, whose life hath been accounted evill, And therfore cal'de by many the blew devill, S[t]ruck with remorse of his ill gotten pelfe, Would in dispaire have made away himselfe, One while by drowning, when that would not be, He drew his knife to worke his tragedie, Intending with that fatall instrument To cut his owne throte. Fearfull punnishment Of a dispairing minde! O, who can tell The pangs that in a guilty conscience dwell? Had not the gracious mercy of the Lord Restraind him from a sinne soe much abhord, With his owne handes he would have stopt his breath And with his bodie sent his soule to death. Thrice happie mortall, which this grace didst finde, Soe that henceforth thou bear a better minde, And let thy actions to his glorie tende That savde thy life from such a fearfull end. Returne thankesgiving, &amp; desire in praier His grace to sheild thee from forlorne dispaire. Latro did act a damn√®d villanie, Adding blacke murder to his robbery, Yet 'cause 'twas closely done he might conceale it, For, save himselfe, none living could reveale it. But see the iust revenge for this offence;‚Äî After the deed, his guilty conscience Torturing his soule, enforc'd him still to think The act disclosde, &amp; he in dangers brinke. He thought the birds still in their language said it; He thought the whistling of the winde bewraide it; He cald to minde that murder was forbidden, And though a while, it could not long be hidden. Destract in minde, &amp; fearfull in his place, Having noe power to call to God for grace, The devill doth suborne him to dispaire, Tells him 'tis pitty he should breath this aire Which hath been such a villaine; thrusts him on To worke his owne death &amp; confusion. He, though he had the murderous hand to spill Anothers blood, himselfe yet durst not kill, And was afraide of others. What e're stirres He iudgeth to be men &amp; officers Come to attache him, &amp; his sight vnstable Takes every bush to be a constable. Thus plagud &amp; torturde with dispaire &amp; feare, Out must the fact, he can noe more forbeare; For which according to the course of lawe Deaths heavy sentence one him he doth drawe; And being brought vnto the place of death, There in dispaire yeildes vp his latest breath. Thus each affection like a tyrant raignes Over mans soule, which letteth loose the reines Vnto selfe will, in which soe slavish state, Mans sence captivd'e, his reason subiugate, Makes the soule clogd, a massie lump of sinne, Which following his creation should have been Like his Creator pure;‚Äîsoules were made free, Not to be held in base captivitie By every passion, but with reasons bitte To checke affections from all things vnfitt. He therfore that intends to live vpright Let him in time curbe hedstrong appetite. [END OF THE SATIRES.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Certaine Poems.] E dulci virus contractat aranea flore, Quando ex vrtica mella leguntur ape. Vera quid hominis forma.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What makes a perfect man? My Muse declare. Externall qualities? Their force is much I doe confesse; but beastes excell vs farre In them; our stepdame Natures will is such, The lions strength mans force doth overquell; The hare in swiftnesse doth vs all excell. In sences likewise brutes doe vs exceed; Hartes in quicke hearing, eagles in sharp sight; Spiders in touching; apes when as they feed, Have daintier palates to procure delight: Tender-nosd houndes, &amp; vultures, senting prey, In smelling doe surpasse vs every waie. Neither doth mans essentiall forme consist In lineaments of body well contr[i]vde; Although heerin of force I must insist He doth excell all beastes that ever livde; Since beastes aspect is downeward as they passe, And man the heavens hath for his looking-glasse. What then? Doth wealth mans perfect forme compose? Noe, though thy wealth doe Cr≈ìsus wealth exceed; Though many miles thy land cannot enclose, Though all things to thine owne desire succeed: Yet this (if thou the matter rightly scanne) Is of noe force to make the perfect man. There is a soule, not generate, but infusde, Immortall therfore, which conjoyntly knit With [the] corriptible bodie, &amp; diffusde By vertue through each member, as is fit, Informes each part, &amp; animates the same, And this mans true essentiall forme doth frame. De quatuor anni partibus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Apollo to his flaming carre adrest Taking his dayly, never ceasing course, His fiery head in Thetis watry brest, Three hundred sixty &amp; five times doth source: As many times Aurora doth appear Ere there be made a full &amp; perfect year. This year equally doth it selfe distribute Into 4 partes, which we doe quarters call, Each having his peculiar attribute Of name, &amp; severall qualitie with all: Spring ever plesaunt, Summer hot &amp; dusty, Fruit-ripening Autumne, Winter colde &amp; frosty. Sweet smelling Spring, that ever chearfull season, Clad with the verdure of fresh hearbes &amp; flowers, Renewes the year &amp; makes it alwaies geason By distillation of his fruitfull showers: This quarter doth (for soe it is assignde) Refresh the sence &amp; recreate the minde. No sooner doth the blazing bright beamd starre, Sol, enter Cancer that signe tropicall, But Summer in his progresse doth declare A hot ensuing season that must fall: Now Ceres, goddesse of all corne &amp; tillage, Begins her harvest in each country village. When day &amp; night are in equalitie, Autumne doth then beginne his course to take, Whom aires temperate serenity A pleasaunt quarter evermore doth make: Now Bacchus treadeth downe the fruitfull vine, And doth compose the spirit quickning wine. When longest night doth make the shortest day, Frostie-facde Winter Autumne doth succeede, In boysterous stormes his force he doth display, Whose nipping colde doth ofte diseases breed: Yet man to please this quarter doth present Domesticke sportes &amp; homebred merriment. Planetarum energia.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Astronomers, with their heaven searching eyes, Seven planets in their severall orbs have found, Whose influence, they say, descends the skies, And in our mortall bodies doe abound: Whose force is great, or else they greatlie lye That calculate mans fatall destinie. Saturn is mounted in the highest sphear, Vnder which planet if man life receive, He shalbe subject to dispairefull feare, Dull melancholy to his minde shall cleave: His stupid braine, his frowning looke, shall bear A crabb√®d nature &amp; a life austere. Next vnto lumpish Saturn, sprightlie Iove Moves in his orbe. Who vnder his aspect Shall breathe this aire (which doth him mortall prove) He alwaies shalbe held in good respect: Pleasing his looke shalbe, comely his feature, Bounteous his minde, and ever kinde his nature. After Iove, Mars assumes his proper seat, Whom poets faine to be the god of warre; That man in battell shall his foes defeate Which vnder Mars is borne, that warlike starre: He will (for of his nature hath been tride) Be quicklie angrie &amp; soone pacifide. In midle of the planettes regiment, Bright Sol, that heauenlie ever burning lamp, Himselfe doth in his glorious orbe present. Who vnder him receives his native stampe, Shalbe well skild in artes, in conference wise, Religious in heart, in life precise. After bright Sol, the beauteous queen of love Faire Citherean Venus takes her place: Who vnder her aspect is borne, shall prove Skilfull in love; &amp; with a blushlesse face He shall vnto his lawlesse lust allure Many that are of thoughts &amp; life impure. Next Venus, in his sphear is Maiaes sonne, Ioves messenger, wing-footed Mercurie: Who vnder his aspect his life begunne Shalbe endude with craft &amp; subtilty; He wilbe (soe his state thereby may mend) Apt to deceive even his most trusty friend. Lowest of all the planets plac√®d is Selfe-chaunging Luna: vnder whose aspect If man be borne, he never shall have misse Of an inconstant heart, which doth detect A perverse nature, &amp; a peevish minde: Vnder this starre are borne most women kinde. Every man hath his constellation Vnder one of these planets influence Predominating, &amp; the calculation O[f] his ensuing fortunes comes from hence, Be he to labour borne, to art, or warres: Thus starres rule man, &amp; God doth rule the starres. De quatuor elementis.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Each sublunarie bodie is composde Of the fower elementes, which are proposde By Nature to that end, a worke t' admire That aire should meet with earth, water with fire, And in one bodie friendlie sympathize, Being soe manifestlie contraries. These elements apparent to the eye Are mixt, &amp; not of simple puritie; Pure simple ones ther are, but wher they be Passes the skill of our philosophie. Wheither earths purer elementall part Reside within Thessalian Tempes heart; Wheither Arabia F≈ìlix it containes, Or Edens garden, or th' Elizian plaines; Olympus hill, or mountaine Appenine, Our Albion heer, or fertill Palestine, I rashly in opinion dare not enter. Who shall finde out earth[s] yet vnheard of center? Where purest water is, declare who can, Whether in midst of the vast ocean, Or where rich Tagus workes vp golden sand; Whether in some clear rivolet on land, As in the spring vpon Parnassus hill, Where the nine Muses dip their learned quill; In silver Ganges, or that fountaine rather Where faire Diana with her nymphs doth bath her? Art thou perhaps that purest breathing aire, Sweet Zephirus, which wontst to make repaire To amarous Psyche, when for Cupids love, She fearlesse lept downe from the rocke above. If thou be that pure aire without all doubte, Shew me thy dwelling, &amp; I'le seeke thee out, And having found thee, then my next desire Shalbe for purest elementall fire; Be it within the moones concavity Or above all the heavens convexity, Doe it within that fornace closely lurke, Where Vulcan &amp; his Cyclopes doe worke, Or be it that celestiall fire above Which wise Prometheus stole away from Iove. But I leave these pure elements alone, To speake of these amongst vs better knowne. This quadruplicity, these elements, From whom each body takes his existence, Have qualities calde elementarie, Knowne by the names of first &amp; secundarie. Earth is the driest in his first degree, Then coldnesse is his second quality. Coldest is water in first quality, Then moysture is his second propertie. Moistenesse in aire houldes principality, And heat is secundarie quality. Fire doth predominate in calidity. And then the next degree is siccity. Fire hot &amp; dry, aire moyst &amp; hot we call, Seas colde &amp; moist, earth dry &amp; colde with all. These elements, although they doe agree In the composure of mortalitie, Yet in each body one it selfe doth vaunt, And is above the rest predominant. In man complexions plainly doe dilate What element is moste predominate. In cholerick bodies, fire doth govern moste; In sanguine, aire doth chiefly rule the rost; In flegmatick, hath water greatest sway, Dull melancholy seemes to be of clay. It is recorded by some antiquaries, Nor doe I see that it from truth much varies, That each before recited element Gives to a bruit his onlie nutriment. I speake not this of those we purest call, For they, I know, cannot sustaine at all. The earth vnto the mole her essence gives, The herring only in the water lives; Aire only the camelion doth suffice, And salamander from the fire dies. To these 4 brutes, living in this estate, Fowre kindes of men we may assimilate. Like to the mole the worldly minded man Workes in the earth, as if he headlong ran Into her bowels; for some paltry gaine, He digs, &amp; delves, &amp; toiels himselfe with paine. His avaritious minde is wholy bent Vpon the purchase of this element; Blind like the mole in 's intellectuall eye That should direct him to felicity. The second kinde from water doth alone Produce his lifes best sustentation, And such are they which vse damnd piracie, And live vpon the sea by robberie, These with the herring make the sea their friend Till some of them at Wopping take their end. Ambitious men doe one the ayer feed; Like the camelion they are pleasde indeed With meer aeriall praise; good wordes (I think) Fattens them better then their meat &amp; drinke. Some of this kinde build castles in the aire, Thinking themselues instald in honours chaire In their selfe pleasing mindes, when such promotion Is as farre from them as they from devotion. But they think soe; &amp; he should doe them wrong That puts them by this their conceit soe strong. Lust is the fire that doth maintaine the life Of the venereous man (but sets at strife The soule &amp; body). Did I say maintaine? I should haue saide consume, for soe 'tis plaine. Yet can he live noe more without desire, Then can the salamandra without fire. De quatuor virtutibus cardinalibus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What may the reason be that we doe call Our fower excellent vertues cardinall? Is it because Romes Cardinals moste vse them, And other men doe more then they refuse them? No truely, for each severall vertue trie, And you shall finde that they one few relie. For wisedome first, what wisdome can ther be In them, who, given superstitiouslie, For the true God doe images adore, And in necessity their healpe implore? Yet why should I their wisdome thus defie, Whose crafty witt and damn√®d pollicie Is to enrich themselves, though their soules have Perdition, whom true wisdome seekes to save? For iustice next, doth iustice with them live Who absolution to each sinne doe give For a corrupting bribe? The sonne may kill His aged parentes; man the blood may spill Of his deepe foe &amp; 'scape; for a large fee Wrong shall take place, &amp; right perverted be. If these thinges we may iustice iustly call, Iustice is vsde by every Cardinall. But it may be in temperance they excell, And therin doe all only bear the bell. If to be Epicures, and live at ease, Swallowing vp pleasures when &amp; how they please, We doe account a temperat sober life, Then these are they we graunt withouten strife. Their chastety is soe immaculate That they doe alwaies live in virgin state, Marriage they nill admitt by any meanes, Yet doe allowe of concubins &amp; queanes. Lastly to speake of manlie fortitude, Therin their calling shews them to be rude; Full ill (we know, &amp; every man may see) A steely helme, &amp; Cardnals cap agree; As for their fortitude of minde, 'tis small, Proud in their height, dejected in their fall. I, but their power 's great great; in oppression, Treding downe vertue, raising vp transgression. These are their cardinall vertues of cheife fame, Which we may trulie cardnall vices name. But now at last a reason shew I shall, Why we these vertues doe name cardinall: Cardinall iustly may derived be From cardo, which a hinge doth signifie; Soe these 4 vertues, all the rest enfolde, Even as the hinges doe the dore vpholde. Scilicet vt fulvum spectatur in ignibus aurum, Tempore sic duro est inspicienda fides.The attribution of this poem is questionable. A certaine man which great possessions had, Had likewise store of friendes; as who's so mad To think that friendship doth not wealth pursue, Though for the moste part fain√®d &amp; vntrue? This man of wealth (though seld it soe be found In a young man) in iudgement did abound, And him bethought a way his friendes to trie, How they would serve him in extremity. He kills a calfe &amp; ties him in a sacke, Whom vp he takes &amp; carries one his backe; And then straightwaies vnto his friendes he goes, And in this manner doth his minde disclose. ‚ÄúMy friendes,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúyour loves I now must trie, For friendes are truly prov'de in misery; Vnlesse your succours doe my life defend, I am in danger of a shamefull end. Knowe, in my rage I have slaine a man this day, And knowe not where his body to conveigh And hide it from the searchers inquisition, My house being subject to no mean suspition. Healp me, good Sirs, in my distress√®d state, Since thus to you my griefs I doe dilate.‚Äù ‚ÄúDepart,‚Äù quoth they, ‚Äúfrom vs, you are a stranger! We mean not for your love to bring in danger Our goodes &amp; lives; should we a murder hide 'Twould even by sencelesse creatures be descride. Your friendship thus distainde with innocent blood We doe disclaime. While your estate was good, And your selfe free from danger of the lawe, The fatnesse of your purse had power to drawe Our wealth-pursuing loves; but you must knowe, Our friendships with your fortunes ebbe or flowe.‚Äù Thus severally he all his friendes did trie, And had from them this or the like replie; At last he cals to minde a man of fashion, With whom his father held much conversation Whilome he livde, &amp; oft had heard him praise His friendship, prov'de in divers hard assaies. To this as to the rest the young man hies, And in like manner his fainde griefe discries; He for his fathers sake, which was his friend, Sweares he will doe his best his life to shend. The body then he takes, &amp; meanes to hide; Vowes secrecie, what euer doe betide. ‚ÄúAnd if,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúyou 'le on my faith relie, I 'le keep you safe from the world searching eye, Vntill this gust of danger be o're blowne, Which threatens death, if that the fact be knowne.‚Äù The man reioycing in his friends firme love, Sayes how he did it but his faith to prove, ‚ÄúAnd now,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúby giving of false fire, I have found out the thing I doe desire, A faithfull friend, vpon whose trust I may My life, my landes, &amp; all my substance lay.‚Äù Then vp &amp; tels him all the project plaine, How the dead body was a calfe yslaine. The other, wondring at his pollicie, Resolv√®d straight a knot with him to tie Of never-dying friendship to their end, Thus each to other was a perfect friend. Mean while the other from him he removde, Whose fain√®d love sufficientlie was prov'de. Somnium.The attribution of this poem is questionable. About the dead time of the silent night, Disquiet thought debarring sounder sleepe, A dreame I had that did me much delight, Wherof my minde doth yet impression keepe, Because it chiefly touch√®d single life, In good or bad election of a wife. Methought 3 virgins did appear vnto me, In their attyer all full seemly clad, Which saide they came on purpose for to wooe me, To know to which I most affection had: ‚ÄúBut first (said they) before this thing thou shew Thou each of vs shalt severally knowe.‚Äù Then first gan say the fairest of the three, ‚ÄúI Beawty am; if me thou list to take, Thy fancy shall receiue content in me, And I will never thy true love forsake: But I am poore, &amp; have no meanes at all Reliefe to give, if want should thee befall.‚Äù The second then begann, ‚ÄúI Wealth am hight; If me thou chuse thou never shalt have lacke; Aboundance thee to give is in my might, To fill thy belly, or to clothe thy backe: Only I am (as thou maist well beholde) Deformde, hard-favourd, crabbed, wringkled, olde.‚Äù Then quoth the third &amp; last, ‚ÄúMy name is Witt; If me thou chuse to give thy minde content, I can discourse, with wordes moste apt &amp; fitt, Of nature, heaven, &amp; every element: But this be sure, a wanton I will prove, And not be tyed vnto on[e] only love.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd now,‚Äù quoth they, ‚Äúthine answeare we request, For we of purpose come the same to knowe; Tell whether of vs thou canst fancy best.‚Äù‚Äî And heer me thought they left to speake; when loe! I fram√®d me an answear them to make, But forc'd my selfe, &amp; thus I did awake. Brevis Allegoria.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Out from the depth of Griefes infernall cave Sad Melancholie rose with weeping eyes; Company had she none, ne would she have, But ne're pleasd Discontent, with whom she hies With as swift feet as Griefe to her had lent, Vnto the surging billowes of Lament, To be washt o're into the desert Languishment. The ferriman, or boatswaine of the lake, Incredulous, all doubting, hight Dispaire, Would none conduct that did not aye forsake To draw the breath of that halfe killing ayre Issuing from Hope, his still profess√®d foe, Which makes men constant in abiding woe, Expecting still at length their trouble to forgoe. The boat wherin this Ferriman of hell Dischargde his office, was a fearfull hulke Framd' of a guilty conscience (worst of ill); The sailes composde of sinne, whose monstrous bulke Swelling with sighs, which were the gales of winde Made the barke seeme to flie; a fearfull minde Was the maine-mast, &amp; doubt for anchor was assignde. Thus rigd &amp; trimd, it floteth vp &amp; downe, To ferry passengers vnto the shore Of that inhospitable desert, where no towne, Ne humane wight inhabited of yore; Yet gins it now with people to abound, Which daylie passe o're to that hatefull ground, Although they know it will at length them quite confound. For whie, within that desert lyes a cave, Where horrid Murder, Death[s] sterne sire, doth dwell; Him that Dispaire doth hither bring, this slave Doth straight encounter, leads him to his cell, Presenting him with cordes to stop his breath, Poyson to kill him, or else doth vnsheath Swordes, ponyards, knives, all instruments of curs√®d death. As Melancholie posted to the shore, To be conducted to this balefull place, Hope met with her &amp; never gave her o're, Till she had staide her rash vnsteady pace. And with wise wordes, diverting her intent From seeking out the desert Languishment, At last she brought her to the house of Merriment. De Fortuna.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Well have the poetes fainde the queen of chance, Dame Fortune, blinde, &amp; fixd vpon a wheele, The swiftnesse of whose motion may entrance A dull spectatours eye; at whose feet kneele Great potentates, &amp; kinges that sue for grace, Whom as she list she spurns or doth embrace. Sometimes she rayseth to emperiall throne An abject peasant &amp; base cuntry swaine, Who from the ycie to the torrid zone Boundeth the frontiers of monarchall raigne: Then downe she thrustes from their supernall seat Princes &amp; kings, &amp; makes them begg their meat. O could she see, she would not be soe mad (As now she is) in honour to advaunce (Vertue despisde, &amp; art but meanlie clad) Vnmatch√®d vice, &amp; worthlesse ignoraunce: But blinde she is, &amp; seeth no mans fall; Deafe, &amp; can harken vnto no mans call. Homo Arbor.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Like as a tree from forth the earth doth spring, So from the earth doth man his essence take; The tree shootes forth &amp; doth faire blossoms bring, So man, till youth his mansion doth forsake: The tree growing crooked, if you'l have it mended, Whilst that it is a twigg it must be bended. Right soe it fares with man, whose infant age Is apt of any forme to take impression, Following advice &amp; reason or else rage, According as his youths frame takes succession: If green he be not bended, but let grow, When he is olde hee'l breake before hee'l bowe. When lusty Ver approcheth, he doth bring Fresh vigour to the tree &amp; liveries gay; Soe man doth reassume new health i' th' spring; The tree when moysture failes will fade away: And man will quickly perish like a plant, If he that humidum radicale want. Looke how at length the tree to ground doth fall, Though long it stand fast fix√®d in the earth; Soe man, thoug[h] long he live, yet die he shall; No helpe there is in honour, wealth, or birth: The tree what way it falls, that way doth lye; Even so shall man be iudgde as he doth die. Mundus Theatrum.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The world by some, &amp; that not much amisse, Vnto a Theater compar√®d is, Vpon which stage the goddes spectatours sitt, And mortals act their partes as best doth fitt. One acts a king, another a poore swaine; One idely lives, another taketh paine; One, like Orestes, becomes mad with rage, Another seeks his furie to asswage. And as i' th' play that man which acts the king, (Though many he to his obeisaunce bring) I' th' end is of no more account then he, Which represents the beggers misery, So is't i' th' world, when every man by death Has his last exit, which doth stop his breath. The king for all his crowne shall reape noe grace, Nor beggers meannesse shall his cause embase. But to my thinking, in this saide compare, Though many iump, yet some things differing are. In our stage-plaies ther 's but one foole at most And sometimes none at all; we cannot boast So much, farre otherwise with vs it is; We act the same part all, not one doth misse. They shew awhile in iest their foppery, We still in seriousnesse our foolery. Armat spina rosas.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hard is it for the patient which is ill, Fulsome or bitter potions to disgest, Yet must he swallow many a bitter pill, E're he regaine his former health &amp; rest: To keep the body safe is mans desire, Though it be done through water, sword, &amp; fire. The hardy soldier, with death-threatning sword, To kill his hostile enemy procures, In hope the conquest will rich spoiles afford, He mortall strokes &amp; bloody woundes endures: Victorious tryumph ther doth never grow, But by the adverse parties overthrowe. The silly bee his hony doth defend, And from his hive doth chase the drone away; Yea oftentimes with man it doth contend And 'gainst him doth his threatning sting display: Loth is it his mellifluous meat forgoe, Which with such paine it gathers too &amp; froe. The odoriferous &amp; fragrant rose, Which in the spring tide shewes his blushing hiewe, For fence it selfe with prickes doth round enclose, Which make the gatherer oftentimes to rue, And wish, with his prickt fingers making mone, That he had let the verdant rose alone. T[h]e amorous lover, ere he can enioy His wish√®d end, doth many paines endure; Sometime his love disdainfull is &amp; coy, And will not stoop vnto his gentle lure; Sometime he feares she will vnconstant prove, And not reward him faithfull love for love. Straight is the passage vertue to attaine, And steep the hill that vnto honour leads; Art is not had without industrious paine, Nor wealth possest by praying vpon beads: Things of great prise are not atchiev'de with ease, But once attaind, they doe for ever please. Comparatio mortis &amp; Hyen√¶.The attribution of this poem is questionable. A monstrous beast ther is Hyena namde, Whose shape of sundry formes compos√®d is; Like to a wolfe her visage is iframde, A vipers swelling neck she hath, I wis; An elepha[n]ts huge backe, voice like a man, And Proteous-like, transforme her selfe she can. Death like this monster is in each respect: First like a wolfe that ravenous is of prey, Whose very looke his rapine doth detect, Ne spareth he ought commeth in his way; So death is cruell, suffering none escape; Olde, young, rich, poore, of all he makes his rape. Next as a viper swelleth on the ground, And glideth to &amp; fro to many a place, Yet wher he was no print there can be found, So nimble is he &amp; so quick of pace; Soe death is heer &amp; yonder in one stound, And kills &amp; sleas, yet no man sees him wound. The elephant in strength to him doth yeild, Though he 'mongst beastes the strongest be accounted, And castles carries on his back in field, Where fighting men, as on a tower mounted, Safegard themselves &amp; doe their foes annoy; But death whole townes &amp; countries doth destroy. A man he is in craft &amp; pollicy, Lurking full closely to devour his prey; So death is full of craft &amp; subtilty, And vnawares doth many take away; As with sweet sleep he closeth oft the sight, Yet shuttes the eyes in an eternall night. Lastly as Proteus into sundry shapes (When as him list himselfe transforme) could change, Or male or female he could be perhaps Nor male nor female; soe doth death estrange Himselfe into each sexe when as him will, That is, both male &amp; female he can kill. Vesper exornat diem.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What proffits it the well built ship to ride Vpon the surging billowes of the maine, Drivne with a pleasant gale &amp; a calme tide, If, ere it iornies end it doth attaine, By boysterous stormes, which cannot be withstood, Sea wrackt it perish in the raging floud? The learned artistes much admired skill In life-preserving phisicke is then tride, When some strange cure is wrought; not every pill Or olde wifes medecine to the sick applide Can griefe recure; 'tis arts all knowing lore Must man vnto his wonted health restore. He that with trenchaunt blade in bloody fight, Singlie opposde, &amp; clad in equal armes, Hath slaine his foe, or forcd him vnto flight, Vsing noe witch-craft, sorcery, nor charmes, May worthely crowne his victorious brow With oken leaves of Ioves tryumphant bow. Who truely can affirme the day will prove Pleasant &amp; faire, e're even doth appeare, When sodeinly o'recast, the heauens remove Oft times their beawty which our sight doth chear; Successe by the event is knowne, the end Doth every action praise, or discommend. Virtus persequenda.The attribution of this poem is questionable. He that in youth doth vertues path way tread, When age vpon his wrinkled front shall sitt, A crowne of honour shall enguirt his head, And though he dye, his praise shall never flitt: With her shrill trumpet never dying Fame, Vnto the world shall still resound his name. But he that vertue in his youth disdaines, And like a lozell runneth out his race, Shame &amp; not honour in his age attaines, And after death on earth shall have noe place: Lethe shall drowne his ill deserving name, But vertuous acts are still enrolde by Fame. Cur Venus orta mari.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The poetes faine (for soe I know I read) That Venus of the seas white foame was bred, And therfore Aphrodite doe her call, Which name doth signifie as much to all That know the word; but wherfore she should be Deriv√®d from the froath of Neptunes sea I know noe reason, since, as I doe gather, Neptune her vnckle was &amp; not her father; Vnlesse that we, against true logicks lawes, From the effect produce th' efficient cause; And that too by comparison must be As thus:‚Äîwe all know that the foaming sea Is salt &amp; bitter to our tasting sence; So lustfull Venus, which is saide from thence To issue forth, proves salt &amp; bitter still, To them that follow her disordered will. Medio tutissimus ibis.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Climenes brat, aspiring Pha√´ton, Dryving the fierie horses of the sunne Out of the midle way, vp to the seat Of Iupiter, &amp; scorching with the heat Of his bright flaming charriot all the goddes, Was by incens√®d Iove whipt downe with roddes Of thundering lightning to the raging wave O' the vast ocean, his vntimely grave. Fond Icarus, proud of his waxen wings Soaring to high, is drench√®d in the maine, When D√¶dalus his plum√®d bodie brings Safe to the shore. Ambition is a traine That life entraps; a golden mean the way To live securely; for we often see Men of most honor soonest doe decay, When meaner men live in tranquility. Wilt thow be safe? strive not to climbe at all; Low shrubs stand fast, when statelier okes doe fall. Scribimus indocti doctique epigrammata passim.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Iohnson they say 's turnd Epigrammatist, Soe think not I, believe it they that list. Peruse his booke, thou shalt not find a dram Of witt befitting a true Epigram. Perhaps some scraps of play-bookes thou maist see, Collected heer &amp; there confusedlie, Which piece his broken stuffe; if thou but note, Iust like soe many patches on a cote. And yet his intret Cato sta[n]ds before, Even at the portall of his pamphlets dore; As who should say, this booke is fit for none But Catoes, learned men, to looke vpon: Or else, let Cato censure if he will, My booke deserves the best of iudgement still. When every gull may see his booke 's vntwitten, And Epigrams as bad as e're were written. Iohnson, this worke thy other doth distaine, And makes the world imagine that thy vein Is not true bred but of some bastard race. Then write no more, or write with better grace; Turne thee to plaies, &amp; therin write thy fill; Leave Epigrams to artists of more skill. In Madamam quandam.The attribution of this poem is questionable. A country lasse of silly parents bred, In London was for service entertainde, And being of a wealthy master sped She with her luring lookes so farre him trainde, That he embrac'd her in a marriage bed, But first she pawnd to him her maydenhead. What plottes she had, what tricks she then did vse, To bring her matter to soe good effect, I list not now repeat; lest for the stewes New stratagems I plainlie doe detect: But such they were, that from a scullians life Made her a wealthy marcheantes second wife. Then gan she trip it proudlie one the toe, And mince it finely vpon London streetes. She lady-like in her attire did goe, Bought with the purchase of vnlawfull sheets; At last, her of her husband death bereft, Who dying, her a wealthy widow left. Ambition now began to swell her minde, All her desire was to be ladifide; And with a knight at len[g]th she was combinde, Which made her think herselfe halfe deifide: But well she might, in Edens plot she lies, And all men know that place is paradise. Long liv'de she not in Edens fruitfull soile, For her aspiring minde straight drave her thence; That serpent pride did her soe far beguile, Eden she banisht was for her offence: Iudge, was not woman very much vnwise That thus by pride hath twice lost paradise? In Neandrem.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Neander, held a great cevillian (Let me not say a Machiavillian) Appointed to dispute before the king, Struck mute with fear, could not say anything Save 'twas ill luck; for if he had done well, As we expected he would bear the bell From the whole Academie for the test, 'Tis certaine he had been a knight a[t] lest, And made his wife (what she hath lookt for long) A Madame. Fortune, thou hast done her wrong To hinder his once dubbing of his wife, Which hath dubde him soe often in her life. In Asinium.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Asinius what I speake straight overhears; Will you know why? Asses have longest eares. In Balbutiam.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Balbutia, which hath all the tricks of art That doe belong vnto a whorish part, Wholly bewitchd a gentleman to leave His wife &amp; children vnto her to cleave Even to his end, &amp;, though God did him blesse With a faire issue, clean to dispossesse His children of his goodes &amp; give her all By his last dying testimoniall. But how dost thrive with her? Exceeding well; She is the likelyst still to goe to hell. But heer she doth not without crosses goe, Those in her children, sonnes &amp; daughters too. Her eldest sonne is hangd or drownd i' th' seas, Her other is as good in forwardnesse. Her eldest daughter 's married to her griefe, Whose husband lives a prisoner &amp; a theefe. Her other daughters would fain married be, But moste that knowe doe hate this progenie. Thus she which made mothers fare the worse In her owne seed hath this deserv√®d curse. In adulantes Aulicos.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Base sycophantes, crumbe-catching parasites, Obsequious slaves, which bend at every nod; Insatiate harpies, gormandizing kites, Epicures, at[h]eists, which adore no God But your owne bellies &amp; your private gaine, Got by your oily tongues bewitching traine! O how my Muse, armde with Rhamnusiaes whip, Desires to scourge your hell-bred villanie, And with Astr√¶as sharp edgd sword t' vnrip The hatefull cloke of your deformity; Whose naked view soe odious would appear, That we should hate what now is held full deare. Your sly deceits dissimulation hides, Your false intent faire wordes obnubilate; So 'mongst the greenest grasse the serpent glides, And freshest flowers foule toades coinquinate: All is not golde that hath a glistering hiew, But what the touchstone tries &amp; findeth true. Dissentions, &amp; twixt friends vnfriendly jarres, Your base tale-carr[y]ing tongues doe sett abroch, Intestine broyles, cyvill vncivill warres, Which end in death or infamous reproch, Are causd' by your insinuating wordes, Whose poysnous breath wounds deeper then keen swordes. Avaunt, ye fauning curres, &amp; leave the Court! Flatter not greatnesse with your scurrill praise. Dare flies approach where eagles doe resort? And shall the cuckoe in [a] cove[r]t chaunt his laies? For ye, like cuckoes, all one note doe sing, And like to flies doe buzze about our king. But he, the princely Eagle, scornes such flies, Such butter-flies, such gnates, whose humming sound Relisheth not his eare; nor doe his eyes Affect your gaudy outside, which abound More in queint speach &amp; gorgeous attire, Then in your loves, which ought to be entyre. Ye Aristippian zanies, Albions ill, Leave off at last your poysning honnied speach; Let not your sugred wordes be traines to kill, Iust like the foxe when he to geese doth preach: And ye rich men, which selfe-conceit doe love, Be not such geese, foxe-flattering praise to prove. So Aesops crow whom crafty rainard spide With prey in bill, was earst by him deceivde; ‚ÄúO thou faire bird‚Äù (a lowd lie!) then he cride, ‚ÄúWhy singst thou not, whose musick hath bereavd The nightingale of that respect she held, Since thy sweet voice a sweeter note doth yield?‚Äù The silly crow, bewitchd with flattering praise, Addrest herselfe to give the foxe a song, When opening wide her bill to chaunt her laies, Downe fell the prey she held! The foxe ere long It quite devoured had, gan her deride; Then, all too late, his cunning she espide. Such crowes are they whom flatterers beguile; Such foxes they which flatter, faune, &amp; cog: Brittans, let them no more sucke vp your oyle; Be Aesops crow noe more, but Aesops dog. Chace hence these foxes, which at your mercy stand, For our then happy made Eutopian land. Somnium.The attribution of this poem is questionable. About that time when as the chearfull spring Bedeckes the earth with her sweet smelling flowers, When pretty birds with their sweet caroling, Record their ditties in Silvanus bowers, I fortunde, envited by the aire, Vnto a pleasant grove to make repaire. Quite through the thicket ran a pleasant spring, Whose gentle gliding a sweet murmure made; The place (sufficient to content a king) Allurde me to repose vnder the shade Of a broad beech, the aptnesse of which seat Preservde me from the sunnes annoying heat. Not many minutes did I there repose, Ere gentle Morpheus, powerfull god of sleep, With his compelling charmes mine eyes did close. Such harmony the chirping birdes did keep Coniointly with the sweetly warbling streame, That my long slumber did begett this dreame: Me thought it was about the dead of night, What time there was presented to my view A spectacle that did me much affright, And all my sences in amazement drew; Till manly courage, putting fear to flight, Made me expect the issue of the sight. The fearfull obiect of my wandring eye, In shew appeard to be a womans shape; Her looke was heavy, &amp; did well descrie She had been subiect to noe mean mishappe: Her robes were costly, crown√®d was her head, Which did foretell she was not basely bred. One of her handes a bloody sword did graspe, Wherwith had been transfixd her tender heart; The other hand a burning torch did claspe, By light wherof I might descrie each part Of her well featured body, whose sad plight Drew forth salt teares from my relenting sight. I would have questiond whence, or who, she was, But admiration such amasement bred, That not one word from forth my lips could passe, My voice had lost his office &amp; was dead,‚Äî Buried in silence lay; when loe, ere long The apparition thus let lose her tongue:‚Äî ‚ÄúYoung man‚Äù (quoth she) ‚Äúthy spirites recollect; Be not amazde mine vncouth shape to see; Such peevish fear doth shew a minde deiect, Or guilty conscience, which are farre from thee: Give ear vnto me, &amp; I will relate A true sad story of my pass√®d fate. ‚ÄúI am by birth of most divine discent; For I am daughter to immortall Iove, From whom into the world I first was sent As witnesse of his reconcil√®d love With mortall man; for which effect I came From heaven, &amp; True Religion is my name. ‚ÄúFirst went I to the vnbeleeving Iewes; But there I could smale entertainment finde: The greater part did vtterlie refuse To lodge me in their heartes, &amp; wilfull blinde Did cast me from them; though alone by me Man can attaine to true felicity. ‚ÄúBy them reiected thus, I did intend Vnto the Gentiles next to bend my course, To see if they would greater favour lend: With these I had indeed somewhile great force, And purchasde a large kingdome with this crowne, Till the ten persecutions put me downe. ‚ÄúBut noe oppression could me quite suppresse; Nay, persecutions made me flourish more; I still was slaine, yet still I did increase, And growing lesse, grew greater then before: Cammomill trodden doth the farther spred, And the palme prest, the higher lifts his head. ‚ÄúRome was of yore my place of residence, Where as a soveraigne I long time did sitt, Till antichristian prelats drave me thence; Then did I flie to Brittaine, &amp; in it I have till now, &amp; ever will remaine, Till the world shall to chaos turne againe. ‚ÄúWith this sharp sword, which in my hand I holde, A cruell Lady pearcd me to the heart; The wound is fresh to see, the blood scarce colde,‚Äî Her name was Mary that did act this parte: But e're she kilde me she was slaine by death, And I revivd'e by young Elizabeth. ‚ÄúForty-fower yeares this far renown√®d queen, Honord of all, me above all did honor; But fates her, graie in yeares, in vertues green, Cald to a worthier place, death seazd vpon her, And for this world, which nought but sorrow yeilds, Carried Eliza to th' Elizian fields. ‚ÄúAfter her death the good Iosiah came, When the land feard some sodaine innovation, And, for the propagation of my name, Contracts a league with many a neighbour nation; Wisely foreseeing that by such a peace, My crowne should flourish &amp; my power encrease. ‚ÄúVnder this monarch, or above him, rather, I rule this Britaine Empire &amp; doe bring Many a soule vnto my heavenly Father, In spite of Rome, which for me hates the king: But God will blesse him, &amp; vnto the end He and his issue shall my cause defend. ‚ÄúIf thou wouldst know whie this bright burning light Mine other hand doth bear, I will thee tell; I have an enemie as darke as night, Cald Error (I to heaven, she leades to hell) Whose blacknesse to obscure me doth endevour, But that this light doth her false mists dissever. ‚ÄúThe reason why I looke thus heavily, Is 'cause of late my power gins decay; That hellish monster, damnd hypocrisie, Doth carry in the land far greater sway; Enters my temples &amp;, in spite of me, Vsurps my place &amp; titles soveraigntie. ‚ÄúThere is a sort of purest seeming men, That aide this monster in her wrongfull cause, Those the world nameth‚ÄîPuritanes I meane‚Äî Sent to supplant me from the very iawes Of hell, I think; by whose apparant shew Of sanctity doe greatest evils grow. ‚ÄúVnless the hand of wise authority Doe reinstall me in my former place, And punish them &amp; their hypocrisie, They will ere long mine honour quite deface. And so I prethee, tell him gentle youth,‚Äî Be not afraide, 'tis nothing but the truth.‚Äù This saide, methought she vanishd from my sight, And left me much perplex√®d in my thought. I musde a Puritan should be a wight So seeming good, &amp; yet soe passing naught; Till thinking long vpon so strange a theame, At last I wakd, &amp; then I writ my dreame. In curiosos theologos.The attribution of this poem is questionable. You high aspiring wittes, which seeke to prie Into the secretes of the Diety, Is 't not enough to know his will reveald, But you must aime at that which is conceald? By curious inquisition, too much light Hath made you lose the perfect vse of sight. Saint Austines saying may you well befitt, Which vnto one would know (without all witt) By curious interrogation, What God did ere he layd the worldes foundation, Replide, ‚ÄúI think, or rather know full well, He made for such as thee infernall hell.‚Äù A place most meet for them that dare adventure Into Godes secret cabbinet to enter. O, strive not then to know his secret will, Which art can never compasse with her skill! Gratia peccatum superat.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Mounted on winges of high aspiring thought, I soare a loft vp to the throne of grace; My heartes repent, by true contrition wrought, I there present before th' Almighties face. The spotlesse Lambe which for my guilt was slaine, I offer vp a ransome for my sinne; With sighs, praiers, teares, I begge release of paine, Of him that ever mercifull hath been. My soule thus seated in divine desires, Selfe-love allurs me vnto vaine delight, Then quench√®d are my former heavenly fires, Till grace doth once againe put sinne to flight. Thus sinne with grace, &amp; grace with sinne doth strive, Till sin lie dead, &amp; grace doe sinne survive. Christianus Agnus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Like a young tender lambe that man must be Which doth professe true Christianity With sincere heart, in imitation First of that spotlesse Lambe, whose Passion Brought sinfull man from endlesse misery To the true center of felicity. Next, as a lambe is harmlesse, innocent, Meek, gentle, humble, quiet, patient, So must a Christian be; his harmlesse life Must be devoide of all malicious strife. Revilde, he must not once revile againe, But must doe good for ill, must suffer paine And persecution with an humble heart And patient minde; yea, though it doe impart The bodies death; such martirdome shalbe A glorious crowne of immortality. Lastly, in this respect (if I not erre) A lamb is a true Christians charecter: The infant lambe among a thousand sheep, Whose frequent bleatings a loude murmere keepe, Knowes his owne damme when he but heares her voice, And to sucke her milke onlie doth reioyce: So must a Christian know the Church his mother By her owne voice, the word of God, from other Which are but stepdames:‚ÄîPopish congregations, Brownisme, &amp; Puritannicke invocation[s], Which bleat false doctrine &amp; damnd heresies, He must distinguish from true misteries; And like an infant lambe, the childe of grace, Sucke only from her breastes, which flow apace With the sincere milke of Godes holie word, His soules nutrition. Thus ther is accord In these respectes &amp; more, which I'le not trace, Twixt lambes of nature &amp; the lambes of grace. Christianus Navis.The attribution of this poem is questionable. A ship vnto a certaine haven bent, Turmoilde in Neptunes watry element, With longing expectation doth attend To make arrivall to his wish√®d end. This ship thus troubled is a Christiane Tost vp and downe in the vast ocean Of this terrestriall orbe, of which even all We fitlie by the name of sea may call; For 'tis a place of perturbation, Of anguish, sorrowe &amp; vexation, Like the tempestuous sea; &amp; is to vs For rockes, quicksandes, &amp; gulfes, as dangerous. Vpon this ocean terrestriall, This ship, this vessell allegoricall, A Christian, floating vp &amp; downe, doth strive To heaven his safest haven to arrive. Which harbour ere he can entirely winne, He must first passe by rockes &amp; gulfes of sinne, And therfore needes good preparation To make a prosperous navigation. Assist me Ph≈ìbus, &amp; I will recite How he must rigg√®d be to saile vpright. The earthly stuffe wherof this ship 's composde Is flesh &amp; bones in order well disposde. Ships have their sides or ribbes, &amp; soe hath man All tacklings else, soe must a Christian. The maine-mast must be love o' th' Diety; The lesser ones, meeke heart &amp; charity; The sailes strong faith, hope anchor is assignde, And fervent prayer is the gentle winde That blowes it forward; other tacklings be Good thoughtes, good wordes, good workes, which trinity Must all conioyne in one to holde the sailes, For when these stringes slip, faith then quicklie failes. The pilote which must alway be aborde To steere the right way, is Godes holy worde; The sences must the common sailers be, Affections, slaves restrainde of libertie, Kept only to take paines, their actions Must still be ordered by directions Given by reason, which must have some sway In this same voyage; but all must obey The counsell of the pilot, &amp; still stand Prest at his service, when he doth command. Now, 'cause this voyage cannot welbe made Free from all danger, but ther will invade Some hostile foe or other; be ther placd A prospective vpon the top o' th' mast, Wherin 'tis fitt that carefull diligence Keep evermore his watchfull residence, And straight give notice, when he doth descrie The force &amp; comming of the enemie. For Sathan, that leviathan, that whale, Who is an enemie &amp; ever shall To Christian man, doth wat[c]h occasion When he may make his best invasion. Wherfore against this foe, which seekes to kill, Offensive &amp; defensive weapons still This ship must carrie, &amp; himselfe prepare To fight it out like a strong man of warre. First at his beake-head he must fasten on Th' impenetrable helme salvation, And then the breastplate of true righteousnes Which will resist the devill, &amp; represse His furious rage. Then faith his sheild must be To quench the balles of wilde-fyer presentlie; But the sword of the spirit Sathan quailes, And to attaine the conquest never failes: This is the weapon that the pirate woundes, This is the sword-fish which the whale confounds. Thus if vnto the end he doe endure Like a brave champion, then he shalbe sure The fiend will like a coward run away, And he, a happy victour, gett the day. Then having once attaind the victorie, He may advance his flag trivmphantly, And saile with ioy, till he the port attaine, Where in perpetuall blisse he shall remaine. Deum nescire est nihil scire, ipsum rect√® scire, omnia.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Philosophers, which search the cause of things As farre as nature gives their knowledge winges To soar vnto; whose quicke &amp; ready witt A definition to each thing can fitt; Though they can sillogize with arguments Of all thinges, from the heavens circumference To the earths center, &amp; true reason give Of natures power, which makes thinges move &amp; live; Yet if they want faiths intellectuall eye First to believe ther is a Diety, In Godhead one alone, in Persons three, By whom all creatures are, &amp; cease to be, They are but fooles, &amp; they 'r still blinde, not seeing The Cause of causes, which gives all their being. Astronomers that can foretell eventes By the celestiall creatures influence, By errant planettes &amp; by fix√®d starres, Can pre-divine of famines, plagues, &amp; warres; And of their contraries pre-indicate, Which come by an inevetable fate; Can shew th' ecclipses of the sunne &amp; moone, And how the planettes make coniunction; Which have found out, &amp; will maintaine it true, Three orbes, which Aristotle never knew. Yet all this knowledge, though it reach as farre As is the Articke from th' Antarticke starre, Is nothing, if they know not God above, That Primus Motor, which all orbes doth move; Their art wherein they doe themselves advaunce, Lives still ecclips√®d in black ignorance. Phisitions which prescribe a remedy To each disease &amp; bodies maladie; That know what is nocivous, &amp; what good, When it is fit to bath, to purge, let bloode; Although they know the nature &amp; the power Of every simple, every hearbe, &amp; flower, With Solomon, which from the cedar tall Vnto the hisope spreading on the wall, Knew every growing plant, flower, hearbe, or tree, With their true vse &amp; proper qualitie; Yet all their skill as follie I deride, Vnlesse they rightly know Christ crucified. He, he it is, which truly is alone The soules best physicke &amp; Physition. All artes, as well those we call liberall As other sciences mechanicall, What e're they be, &amp; howsoever lov'de, And worthily by mortall man approv'de, If the best knowledge theologicall, Be not conioyn√®d with their rationall,‚Äî What e're they may vnto the world professe‚Äî All their best wisdome is starke foolishnesse. He is the only wise &amp; prudent man Whose knowledge makes him the best Christian. For practise must agree with speculation, Belief &amp; knowledge must guide operation; Man may believe &amp; yet he may dissemble, For even the divels doe beleeve &amp; tremble. 'Tis not enough that we beleeve a God, For this will all confesse that feele his rod; But we must alsoe in this God beleeve, And in our actions not the Spirit grieve. We must beleeve that it was he alone Which gave to man his first creation, And that from him alone comes our redemption, Which is from everlasting death exemption; That we in him alone are iustifide, And by him only shall be glorifide. This we must trow &amp; (though it passe our sence) Repose in this assurde confidence, Which how we must performe in each respect The Scripture plainly doth vs all direct. He that knowes this (although the poorest worme) And to this knowledge doth his life conforme, Want he the giftes of nature, education, Speake he the tongue but of one only nation; Be he a foole in the esteeme of man, In worldly thinges a meer simplician; Yet for all this, I boldly dare averre His knowledge great, &amp; will it farre preferre Before the skill of wise philosophers, Phisitions, lawyers, &amp; astronomers, Which either want the knowledge of the Diety, And live in sinne &amp; damnd impiety, Or, if they know a God, doe fear him rather As a just Iudge then as a loving Father. He that doth truly know Christ crucifide, Doth know enough, though he know nought beside; But he that knowes him not doth only rave, Though all the skill else in the world he have. Ternarius numerus perfectissimus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Of all the numbers arithmeticall, The number three is heald for principall, As well in naturall philosophy As supernaturall theologie. Philosophers, in causes naturall, Holde that all thinges have their originall From three chief causes, or principia, And therfor say tria sunt omnia, From three all essence &amp; existence growe, Materia, forma, &amp; privatio. The body three dimensions doth include, And they are these, length, bredth, profunditude. In mathematique bodies three thinges please, their punctum, linea, superficies. The soule, that breath of life, we threefold call, Vegitive, sensitive, &amp; rationall. Time doth his three divisive partes endure, That which is past, the present, &amp; future. There are three graces; ther be vertues three, Theologicall, faith, hope, &amp; charity. The father of the faithfull, Abraham, Receivde three Angels which vnto him came. From the fierce flames of Nebuchadnezar God was the three childrens Deliverer. Ionah, whose flight Godes mandat had opposde, In the whales belly three dayes was enclosde. Christ, to give man a new regenerate birth, Was three dayes in the bowels of the earth; When he from death &amp; hell a Victour rose, Did three times visible himselfe disclose To his disciples; thrice bad Peter keepe And nourish well his flock of lambs &amp; sheepe. Thrice was let downe to Peter in a dreame A sheet, with beastes, birdes, creeping things vncleane, And he thrice bidden eat, denide consent, Whilest three men sought him, from Cornelius sent. The heavenly kingdome, that celestiall bower, A leaven is, hid in three peckes of flower. Lastly, but principallie, above all The Diety in Persons three we call; This Trinity it is indeed alone Which gives this number best perfection. Thrice happy is that man, with ioy shall see This Perfect Number, this Thrice Glorious Three. De duplici adventu Christi.The attribution of this poem is questionable. When sinfull man in Edens garden plac'd, By stubborne disobedience had defac'd The true id√¶a of his happinesse, And had deservde, for soe great wickednesse, Eternall death, loe, mercy then began To mitigate the punnishment of man. Though earth was cursde, &amp; man must by the sweat Of his owne labour make it yeild him meat; Though woman, whom the serpent had beguilde, In paine &amp; sorrowe must bring forth her childe; Yet from eternall death the promisde seed Put them in comfort that they should be freed. To which effect the only Son of Iove, Out of the infinitenesse of his love To his own likenesse man, came downe from heaven, Toke flesh vpon him, was of life bereaven, And made full satisfaction by his death For all their sinnes, which by a lively fayth Lay holde vpon his meritorious Passion, The perfect path that leads vnto salvation. This Christes first comming was, which we doe name A comming vnto vs in grace; to frame Mans soule to come to him, he first began To come him selfe in grace to sinfull man, From a pure Virgin to take incarnation, From impure Iewes, his patient Passion. His first Advent yeilds a quaternall section, His birth, his life, his death, his resurrection. His birth was poore, that by his poverty We might be made rich in eternity. Borne in a cratch 'mongst beastes (yet for our gaine) That in heavens kingdome we with saintes might raigne. He livd despisde of man, to get vs grace With God the Father; meekly did embrace (Sole sinne excepted) each infirmity Coincident to fraile humanity, That he might put vs in a better state, And in his weaknesse vs corroborate. As he was man he yeilded vp his breath To save vs men from an eternall death, Which death was full of agonie &amp; paine, That our life purchasd, might in joy remaine. Lastly, as God he subdued death &amp; hell, And rose againe from the infernall cell Of conquerd Sathan, to prepare the way For vs to follow him; and now this day Sitting in maiesty at Gods right hand, Sole Mediatour for our cause doth stand, And till his second comming, shall doe still To plead their cause which doe obey his will; Which second comming shall in glory be, And in vnvtterable maiestie. The generall resurrection shalbe then, And dust &amp; wormes returne to living men. Then shall our corruptible flesh put on Immortalnesse &amp; incorruption. Then shall we see Christ comming in the cloudes, When some will wish whole mountaines were their shroudes. Then he the sheep from goates shall separate, The iust &amp; godly from the reprobate, And sheepe have blisse; the other for their hire Perpetuall paines &amp; everlasting fire. Thus shall his second powerfull comming be The godlies ioy, the wickedes misery. Twixt his first comming &amp; his latter one There wilbe found much discrepation. First did he come in all humility, Then shall he come in splendant royalty; First to be iudg√®d by the world he came, Then shall he come as Lord to iudge the same; In his first comming he for man did die, In this he shall give 's lifes eternity. May we the first advent of Christ emploie So to our good that at the latter day, His second comming, when he shall appeare, Before our Iudge we may without all feare Expect that happy sentence, ‚ÄúCome ye blest, And enter into everlasting rest.‚Äù In Momum.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Momus, that foulmouthd slave, my verse derides; Sayes they are plaine, bald balladstuffe; besides They want invention, poetrie, &amp; witt, And are farre worse then ever Bavius writt. Dost not thou like 'em, Momus? Why I 'me glad; That which thou likst, I 'me sure must needs be bad. But be they soe, as worse thou canst not prove them, I tell thee they like me, &amp; I will love them. As for thy scoffes, I neither doubt nor fear them, Thou hast wrongd better, therfore I may beare them. [End.]</field>
