FRANCIS SABIE. FLORA'S FORTVNE. The second parte and finishing of the Fishermans Tale. Come Clio sweet, my neuer-idle Muse, Whose pleasant tunes so cheers a drooping mind, Come cheerful Muse from Helicons faire springs, With Pallas sprigs, and Phœbus Laureats dect, Help, ayd, assist, to sing, declare, rehearse What did betide poore Flora, late the loue Of stout Cassander, long th'inhabitant of Thetis Cell, and Neptunes Monasterie: On whom the Gods and Fortune minded were Ful seuen long winters torments to inflicct. Vnnaturally for that his Sire he left: Whose austere dealing wrought his fatall bane, And for austeritie to Thirsis showne, Not yeelding to his Tyger-taming words. Come gentle Muse, declare the rare euents Which chanced to poore Flora and her Sire: What? can the Gods both frowne and fawne at once? No sooner had Prosperities arch-foe. Death-threatning Fate with force of raging winds, And shattring billowes shrinde her of her loue, But she foorthwith her father gan imbrace, And cleft on him on whom she scarslie durst Now looke vpon, forgetfull she of feare, And he of rage, distresse now made them friends, Each held one arme about the others necke, Each held one arme fast on a shatred pine, Thus saylde they through the monster-shewing sea, Now flying vp to high Olympus tower, Now downe againe to Dis his hellish lake, Somtimes both whelmd with Neptunes frothy waues Sometimes again reuiu'd with drying winds. Long sailde they thus, not thinking once of life. Sencelesse as one on whome Ioues fire hath falne, Or fearfull weapons fram'd by Cyclops hands, When suddenlie Triton did sound retreyt To hoysting waues, and Eolus to windes: Seas were then milde, aire calme, each wind was husht And quiet then, as in the Halcions dayes: The broken bulke on which they sayled then, Without all peril peaceably did swim, A ship by chaunce preserued from this storme, Came sayling by, the Marriners espide These wightes distrest, and mooued vnto ruth, Directed sayles towards them, and tooke them in, And caried them (halfe-drownd) to Delphos Ile, Where wise Apollo giues out Oracles: Here was poore Flora with her wretched Syre, Both set on shore, amazed yet with feare, When seeing death disdaind to end her woes, Vplifting handes vnto the loftie skies, Exclaiming, sobbing, weeping, crying out, And furiouslie renting her yellow haire: Thus Flora made her lamentable mone. Death, Dis, Styx, Proserpine, ye Stygian Gods, Infernall powers, and all ye hellish crue, Why suffer ye me damned wight to liue, Vnfit, yea farre vnfit on earth to dwell? Alasse me thinks, Dis sends me to Reuenge, And Proserpine, to neuer-dying woes: Ay me, see Death disdaines to end my pangs, I am reseru'd, doubtlesse I am reseru'd With Tantalus, or wretched Ixion, Plagues, euer-during plagues still to abide. Pardon, good Thirsis, pardon thine owne child, The worker of thy grief and endlesse bane, And now Cassander, whose delightfull shape, The goddes enuy'd, which made thee be disdainde, Loe now I come to thee, this fatall blade, (A blade she held in hand) shal end my dayes, And though we might not liue together here, Yet shall our Ghosts (ye Gods forbid it not) With Louers blyth, sport in Elizian fields. This said, she would haue therewith slaine herselfe: Whereat her Sire concealing his great griefe, In this wise moou'd her from this desperate act. Stay daughter, stay, let not your hands prepard To saue your life, be authors of your death: Learne of thy Syre, be warned by gray haires, Of manie yeares wit and experience comes: With grieuous plagues the Gods will them torment, VVhich be themselues the authors of their death. Lets rather seeke how to preserue our liues, And not vnnaturallie worke our owne bane. VVhat though you haue bene breedresse of my woes And mothers griefe, the Gods wil haue it so. Men say, Apollo in this sacred Ile, Giues Oracles to wightes which be opprest, Come let vs goe vnto his Temple rich, And see if he will shew to vs what course, Of life to take, or if by any meanes, We may returne into our natiue land, How to returne into our natiue land, This said, they wandred both with pensiue hearts To wise Apollos Church not far from thence, Where when they were, sweet odors rich in smell, On Aultars high religiously they burnt, Then kneeling downe vpon the Marble flints, With naked knees, bare heads, and vp-lifthandes, Making the Temple sound with grieuous sobs, Old Thirsis in this sort gan make his mone. O wise Apollo, fate-præsaging God, Who knowst what things haue bene are and shall be, O wise Apollo, crime-disclosing God, Who doubtles knowst how fate hath dealt with me, Aide and assist vs twaine, whom Fortunes spight Hath causde to erre in this thy Delian Isle, And if the Destenies haue it decreed, That of my lyfe the thred be quite out run, Neere this thy temple let me lay my bones: But let poore Flora my supposed child, Find some redresse, age wils me to expect And welcome death: Her lustie youthful yeares Desire sweet life: the blossomes of my time, Now withered are, but hers are fresh and greene: Or if we may th' Arcadian plaines once see, Tell vs how we againe may them once see: He held his peace, and Flora thus began. O Phebus wise, of Prophets supreame king, Discloser of all secrete mysteries, Tel how old Thirsis, whom proud Fortunes wrath Hath made a pilgrim in thy sacred Isle, May once but see his aged wife againe, Th' Arcadian plaines, and swain-frequented fields: And let me die, death is my due reward: I craue no other, death I haue deseru'd Forthwith a scrowle before them was let fall, And therewithall these thundering voyces sent, Take what you see Arcadians, shun delay, And where this ship sets you on land, there stay. Then giuing thanks, they took and read the scrowle, Wherein these words imprinted were in gold. Old Thirsis, wise Apollo pittieth thee, One of his prophets hencefoorth thou shalt be: Liue Flora with thy Sire, end not thy dayes, Cassander liues not drownd is he in seas. Foorthwith, as they were charged, he made haste Vnto the ship, then ready to lanch out: But Flora doubtfull of the Oracle, Stood stil amaz'd, not knowing what to do. Alasse, quoth she, what meanes the Delian god, With such ambiguous words me to delude? What, was it not as easie to haue saide, Cassander liues: not drownd is he, or els, Cassander liues not: drownde is he? I see, Ay me, I see, the powers minded are To wrap me in a Laberinth of woes: He surely meanes Cassander liueth not, And so Ile take it, drownd is he in deep. This said, her father wild her to make haste, And follow him, as Phebus had giuen charge. She followed him, but with a pensiue heart, And dolefull mind: they both were set on boord, The shipmen quickly lanched into deepe: And gaue full sailes vnto their flying pine: Which Boreas steeds gan draw through Thetis field, And plowghd therwith the sea-gods marshie realme: Vnluckie Flora trembled as she sate, Fearing each waue which shrind her of her loue. Seuen times had Tytan lift his fiery head, From Thetis lap, where he all night had slept: Seuen times againe in her Chrystaline waues, He drencht his chariot, and did sleep againe, When Adrian chiefe ruler of the ship, Fom top of sterne the Greekish coast espide, From whence they came, and whereat in short space, Winds helping them, they safely did arriue? Here Flora landed with her aged Sire. The second time here were they set on shore, And newes was spread through all the land of Greece That Phæbus had a Prophet to them sent, From Delphos Ile, and now he could deuine, Presage, and tell all secretes and hid things, Apollo o she had concealde from him Cassanders fate, his daughters, and his owne. Newes-carying Fame with her loud sounding trump Had quickly blaz'd these tydings through the land; And who so famous now as Thirsis was, Who so renown'd from cuntries far vnknowne, Kings, potentates, old, yong, both rich &amp; poore, And all degrees came flocking vnto him: As though he had Apollo bene himselfe, He briefly would all mysteries disclose, And tel to them their owne peculiar thoughts, VVhat was, had bene, and would be, he could tell. Great store of golde &amp; wealth was to him brought, Yet couetous swaine, still hungrie after gaine, The more he had, the more he sought to haue, Who seeing Grecia cuntrie to containe Faire Medowes, pastures, grounds and fields in it, Sought to encrease his stock, and though he had Now chang'd the aire, yet chang'd he not his mind, But like the Cat whom Iupiter transform'd Into a maid, still ran she to a Mouse. Though Phœbus had a Prophet of him made, Yet would hee shew himselfe to be a swaine, He bought him sheepe and cotes, and neuer had So many flockes in large Arcadian bounds, As now he had within the Grecian fieldes, Sometime himselfe vpon them would attend, Sometime againe, poore Flora would them keepe, And bearing still in mind Cassanders shape, Abandoning a second Louers name. She tearm'd her selfe one of Dianas Nymphs, Or Vestas Nunnes, detesting Venus lawes, VVhich was the cause though many did her loue, Yet they refusde to shew to her their minds. Poore Saint, she wandred vp and down the fields, Exclaiming sobbing,, making piteous mone, And on a time recording her old Loue, As by her heards vpon a hill she stood, Such restlesse passions gripte her inward heart, That desperately she plucked foorth a knife, Ready to pearce therewith her groning heart, And therewithall these dolefull words sent foorth, To which poore Eccho answered in this wise. Fl. What shal I do, shall I die, what shal Flora kil Flora, shal she? or to doe such a fact shall I leaue off? Eccho. I leaue off. Fl. Leaue off, and why so? what liues there any so wretched, or any so lucklesse ech where as I am? Ec. I am. Fl. Why tel, what art thou who me so sadly reanswerst; some distressed Virgin, or woful Eccho? Ec. Eccho Fl. Alas poore Eccho we twaine may well go together, say trulie, what do we two not agree? Ec. Not agree. Fl. VVhy tell good Eccho, liues my Cassander? how should I ioy, if thou shuldest tel me that he liues: Ec. He liues. Fl. Deceitfull Eccho, what meanst thou so to delude me? the sea had him doubtles, it had, and it hath, Ec. It hath. Fl. I know that too well: we two may then goe together. dispairing Flora bids thee then adew. Ec. Adew. This said, she sent foorth grieuous sighes &amp; grones, Grones able to make soft the flintie stones, And therewithall stretcht out againe her blade, Her blade, wherwith she meant to kill her selfe: Recording yet her fathers counsel once, Desisted from this fatall enterprise. Long liu'd she thus, poor wretch, yet at the length Delay did somewhat mitigate her woes, Whom now hemd in a laberinth of griefs, And heape of cares, a while I meane to leaue. Now of her birth, hard haps and parents liues, And natiue soyle, wherein she now remaind, And famous progenie I meane to speake. In these seas (O my Muse) let saile thy barke, And in this ground let run thy wagon wheeles: Agenor once which ware the royall crowne And diademe within this land of Greece. Summond by fate to appeare before the ghostes, And stroken with deaths fame-outracing dart. Now at last gasp, vpon his fatal bed, Readie to die, his sonne vnto him cald, His only sonne Palemon whom he left To weare his crowne, and sit vpon his throne: He came Agenor tooke him by the hand, And shedding teares, thus dolefullie gan speak. Thou seest my sonne, how death now summons me T'appeare before the supreame king of kings: Oh, see my son, how Atropos extendes Her hand, euen novv to cut in two the thred, I must depart, the Fates wil haue it so: Ingraue thou therefore in thy youthfull mind, Thy dying fathers last and latest words: This kingdome now fals vnto thee by lot, And in my steed thou must this throne possesse, Be therefore wise, and as thou knowst, I haue, So be thou carefull of thy subiects wealth: Giue vice his due, and vertue his rewardes, And that thy progenie may also sit Vpon this throne, and weare thy royal crowne, Choose thee a wife equall to thee in birth, Respecting vertue, and not greedy gaine: More for her wisdome, fame and chastitie, Then riches, for me, and transitorie shape: So shall our progenie for euer sit In this high seat, and weare this royall crowne. This said, such death presaging pangs opprest His dying heart, that speech was tooke away. At length great Iuno pittying his estate, Sent many-colloured Iris downe from heauen. Of life Dame Iris quickly him dissolu'd: Straight to a sigh, &amp; huge death bringing grone, Out flew his breath, and to the ghosts gan poste Ay me, how did this sad and gastfull sight A pale Palemons yong couragious mind, Thrise fel he down, and thrise againe was tooke Half dead fr? ground, so nature in him wrought. Yet when this dolor gan it selfe remooue, And cloud of griefe to vanish from his mind, He comfort tooke, and for his buriall rites And funerals, all things he soone preparde, With regaltie, and, worthie such a prince, And Potentate, were speedily dispatcht. He caried with a noble troope of Peeres, In mourning weedes to Pallas temple rich, And there in Marble royally entombde. Shortly met all the Noble men againe, And princelie Peeres, this mourning laid aside, And with one minde, as was his right, they made Palemon king in olde Agenors steed. The set the Crowne vpon his youthfull head, And princelie Scepter in his regall hand. He gouern'd them, and to them he gaue lawes, He was their Lord, he was their onlie king. Three times had Ver expelling Hiems frosts, Refresht the earth, which like a Chaos were, Three times againe had blustering Hyems nipe The fragrant hearbs, which Ladie Ver had brought, When gouerning the famous land of Greece, And quite forgetfull of his fathers wordes, His Lords and Princes gan him wisely mooue, To take a wise sprong of some royall bloud, Alleaging that it would commodious be To him, and not vnpleasant vnto them, A sonne to see, begotten of his seed: So being olde, yet should he still be young, So being dead, he still in them should liue. And furthermore, say they, thy neighbour King, Tuiston high, in Germanie who raignes, One daughter hath a Virgine passing faire, In vertue, wealth, in birth, and natures gifts, Excelling, rich, most royall, and renownd, Who after him shall weare the imperiall crowne, And by ambassage to thy father sent, Who lately hath her proferd to thy wife, And if so be thou minded art to saile, To Germanie to see this sacred impe, whose vertues rare shril Fames loud-sounding trump, Hath almost blazed throughout all the world, Weele guarde thee thither and a fit time now, It is (it was spring tyde) to cut the seas: He straightwayes moou'd at these his Princes words Burnt in desire to see this virgin rare. But by Embassadors he minded first To know Tuistons mind, and whether she Was not betroth'd to an any other king, For els his welcome might haue bene but colde: His sute denide, and all his labour lost: Embassadors he therefore sent in haste, Who speedily returnde with gladsome newes, Newes that Tuiston greatly would reioyce, And be most glad to see him in his realme, Palemon hereat leapt for ioy in mind, And for his iourney all things soone preparde, And royally with manie of his peeres, Did shipping take, and cut the Cærule seas, And in short space, winds furthering his intent, Arriued at Tuistons Germain coast, Soone heard Tuiston that Agenors sonne Was in his realme, and comming towards his court, Who speedily with all his valiant peeres Came foorth to meet, and welcome this great prince. Iulina also (for so called was Tuistons daughter) guarded on each hand, With troups of Ladies faire, and gallant imps, Imps able euen to make Adonis yeeld, To welcome this yoong Prince, came with her Sire, She went: ah not vnlike in view she went, To Regall Iuno, wife of kingly Ioue, Had Venus bene among them, Venus would Haue seemd to her inferior farre in shape, In pregnant wit she Pallas did surpasse: And to be briefe more coy and chast she was, Then that groue-haunting goddesse, who delightes, In menacing the wilde and sauage beasts. Palemon saw her, and he was amaz'd At her rare forme, and excellence in shape, Her looks, her gesture, and mind-pleasing words, Allured so his captiuated minde, Accusing Fame one while, whom then he thought, Too partiall was in sounding her due prayse: And whom euen now he did but wish to see, As greatlie now he did desire to haue: Which in short time I, studie to be briefe, He did obtaine, to both their sweet contents: Their wedding day appointed, now was come, I will not tell here what triumphant shewes And ioy was held throughout all Tuistons land, The higher sort in honour of their Queene, On Coursers braue their valiant prowesse shewd. The rusticke crue made bonefiers in their streetes, The pastorall troope made fieldes with ditties sound: But that dayes pleasure soone gan passe away, His fiery steeds now Tytan did vnyoke, Her pitchie steedes now Luna did bring foorth, Night summond wearie limmes to take their rest: This princely couple layd them down in bed, Most ioyfully: But oh, vnhappie time, O lucklesse night! the spousall wife of Ioue Was not here present, Hymon was not here, Eumenides and Furies present were: And from the chamber top in hellish notes The Screech owle sang a lamentable song. Twice with full circle, twice with wained hornes, Did Cinthia see Agenors sportiue sonne, Courting Iulina his new-wedded wife, And froliking in olde Tuistons Court, When suddenly a great desire to see His countrie Greece, was kindled in his mind, Foorth with he told Tuiston that he needs Should then return vnto his land againe, Alleaging causes of no little force, Which olde Tuiston could not well gainsay. But as he could, he moou'd him yet to stay, But no intreatie would with him take place, Now were swift ships and all things in the port, To carie these two princes into Greece: Aye me what tongue, what Tullie can expresse, But halfe the dolor of this dismall day. Three times Tuististon kissing his sweet childe, Bedew'd her cheekes with his Christalline teares, Three times he would haue said, sweet child farewell, In steed of which came three heart-renting grones: Then charg'd he her, her husband to obey, And at no time to falsifie her faith. Then praid he him to loue his louing wife: By whom he once should gaine so great a Crowne. But now the ships alreadie were lanch'd out, And they on boord, now must they needs away: Poore issulesse Tuiston cried out, Like louing Nurse whose babe is tooke away: Repenting that he euer had bequeath'd His daughter to Palemon, King of Greece, Who had her caried from her Fathers land, Whose only comfort and delight she was: Accusing one while Fate, and senile age, Who would not suffer his vnweldie iointes, Through Neptunes realme to follow his deare child. Long time lamenting thus vpon the shore, Viewing the pines which caried them, he stood: And when they were sailde fullie out of sight, Vnto his Pallace sorrowfull returnde: And as a Turtle Doue, when she hath lost Her louing mate, so seem'd he to lament, Refusing solace, voyd of earthly ioy. And at the last his life in griefe did end. Seuen times Aurora with her ruddie cheekes, Saw yoong Palemon sayling with his loue, Seuen times in Skies night-bringing Vesper shone, By which their sailes the mariners did guide, When turrets high began to shew themselues From Pallas temple in coast of Greece, To which aire-beating Austers flying steedes, Did quickly drawe the saile-supporting pines. Who can expresse but halfe the ioy which Greece Made when Palemon safely there arriu'd, Shril Trumpets blew, bels rang, loud Ecchoes pierc'd The loftie skies, at their arriuall home, And now Palemon, who hadst such a Queene, A peerelesse spouse, with vertues rare enricht, Now mightst thou haue most luckiest bene cald, Of all the Monarks vnder cope of heauen: But no man may be called fortunate, Before his death and latest dying day. Securely now with his most royall Queene, Luld fast a sleep in sweet contentments bed, Raign'd king Palemon, when blisse-hating Fate, Prosperities arch-foe, stedfast in nought, But in wauering vnstedfastnes it selfe: Enuying alwayes Princes happie blisse, And smiling at great Monarks ouerthrow, Now chang'd sweet dimples into wrinkles fell. Thrise after their arriuall into Greece. Faire Cinthia in decreasing had increasde. Her wained hornes, and with full circle showne, When sudden newes from Germanie was brought, That olde Tuiston lately was deceast, And that Palemon should without delay, Go take possession of that royall crowne, Which was his Queens inheritance by right; This thing to doe Palemon was not slacke, Fearing delay might mickle danger bring. Accompani'd with many of his Peeres, He shipping tooke, and cut the foming seas. Leauing his wife vnto the regiment And conduit of a graue and senile man, Eristo cald, of whose fidelitie, And truth he thought he needed not to doubt, Perswaded that his youthfull time was past, And that his age on beautie could not dote. Not knowing that the Canker soonest eates The milk-white Rose, and that corruption doth Soon'st enter into gray and hoary haires. Palemon was now in the Germain coast, Eristo with Iulina his sweete Queene, Who seeing her in feature to exceede All other wightes, which nature euer fram'd, Old cankred Carle gan on her beautie dote, And youthfull Cupid rousde vp his olde limmes, By outward signes which he did daylie showe: But outward signes with him could take no place, At length not able to suppresse these flames, Which kindled were in this old rotten stocke, Presumptuosly he then by sweet requestes Did her intreat to yeeld vnto his will, Thou seest (quoth he) Palemon is farre hence, And swet desire inflames my youthfull mind, Yeeld therefore to Eristos humble suite, Whose life vpon thy mercy doth depend, And olde Eristo shall himselfe confesse, As much as life indebted vnto thee. She dying with a red vermilon hue, Her milkie face, and snow-surpassing cheeks: Auaunt old Carle, quoth she, presumptuous Earle, A traytor false to King and louing prince, Auaunt old foole, whose yeares full many moe Then vertues are, whose age with vice abounds: Dar'st thou in thought but wish thy loyall Queene Vnto thy King to falsifie her faith? No, know Eristo, know, Iulina scornes, Besides Palemon, anie Loue to haue. Know that she scornes all other Monarks loues, Much lesse Eristoes crime-embracing Earle, Away depart from chaste Iulinaes sight, Lust-breathing traytor, crime-committing Carle, Assure thy selfe by mine vnspotted faith, And by Palemons Princely head I sweare, Assure thy selfe thou shalt a terrour be, To all adulterous Earles in time to come, How they dare moue their chast &amp; soueraign Queen To lewd desire, and this thy foule offence Shall punisht be with more than mortall plagues. Eristo then departed in a rage, And by reuenge sought how to wreak his vvrath, A false reporte he presentlie raisde vp, That he had seene Iulina guiltie Queene, With Lord Alpinor playing Venus games. Which thing to make more credible, he hir'd A treacherous Knight, the same for to affirm. Foorth with he tooke Alpinor, spotlesse Lord, And caused him in dungeon to be throwne: He guiltlesse was, and knevv at all no cause, Why vnto him such rigor should be showne, Then sent he letters vnto his dread king, How that the Queene defiled had his bed, And with Alpinor traiterously conspir'd To murther him, and take from him his crowne: And that thou maist thinke this no forged tale, I (saith he) with Calingo saw them both, Like Mars and Venus wrapt in Vulcans net, Vpon thy bed, when Cupid strooke the stroke. Ah how these newes apall'd Palemons mind. His youthfull mind impatient yet of griefe. Three times he shook his griefe præsaging lockes, Lockes neuer woont so furiouslie to mooue. Not Tantalus, amid the fleeting waues, Nor wretched Ixion with his rowling wheele, No damned ghost amid Don Plutoes lake, Did suffer half the tortures which he did. Now did he call to mind Iulinaes fame, Her vertues rare, and neuer-spotted name, Who said, first Lunas steeds shall guide the day, And Tytans night, then Ile be false to thee. One while againe he called into mind, Her heauenly shape, and heart-alluring forme, And that Alpinor was a youthfull Lord. Then of what force sweet Venus fire was, Which oft had causde the chastest gods to yeeld. Much lesse Iulina but a mortall imp, And therefore prone, and easily ouercome, Long time (quoth he) was Dido counted chaste, Yet by request Aeneas made her yeeld. So hath Iulina to Alpinors suite. What's of more might then Venus fierie loue. This in a rage he fullie did beleeue, Not doubting of Eristoes treacherous mind. And leauing there some of his trustie Peeres, As Deputie and vnder him Vize-king, He tooke his iourney speedily toward Greece, Prickt vvith the spurs of fierce and dire reuenge, Whom now one while vpon the seas weele leaue, And to Eristo make a new recourse. Who by all meanes deuisde to bring to passe, To make it seeme more true than trueth it selfe. The homicide this treason did inuent: He to Pandion keeper of the laile, Did humblie come, with Sinons flattering tongue, His withered cheeks bedewing with false teares, Which from his beautie-bleared eies did come, And in these tearmes his fained suit began. Pandion, whom as yet I euer found Eristoes friend, in all his secrete actes, Pandion, vnto whose fidelitie, I dare and will my verie life commit. Eristo needs thy counsell now and aide, And secrecie, but secrete thou must be, Speake on, quoth he, what needs Eristo vse So many words, commixt with princely teares? If he commauund, Pandion shall obey: Although it do the losse of life concerne: If he bid secrete be, he will conceale, Yea though a thousand tortures he should haue. Then (sweet Pandion) listen to my words, And do (quoth he) what I would haue thee doe. Thou knowst I raisde a slaunderous report, Against Alpinor and our royall Queene: Alas, it was a false report I raisde, It was because she would not yeeld to me, And now Alpinor in thy conduct is, And will (I feare me) bring the thing to light. Now that I may my selfe quite rid of feare, And make it seeme more true than truth it selfe: I would haue thee with some sharp iron blade Pierce through his bodie, so should it be thought, He slew himselfe, for feare of further rage. Pandion stood, not knowing what to doe, That he should slay so innocent a Lord, Yet at the last he swore by all the Gods, That he would do't, when time and place shuld serue. Eristo then departed, glad in mind, Pandion dolesull, knew not what to doe, Sometime he thought vpon his promise made, Sometime vpon this detestable deed. And standing thus, vndoubtfull what to doe, He brake into these variable tearmes. Ah poore Pandion, how art thou beset, In two great straits, not knowing what to doe: For lucre sake wilt thou thy selfe exclude From heauenly blisse in sweet Elysian fieldes? Wilt thou now purchase Sisiphus his plagues, In murthering the sin detesting blood? What? Fear'st thou more a poore terrestiall man, With earthly plagues who can but thee reward. Than supreame powers, who can for thine offence, Who can with endlesse torments thee inflict? A guiltie conscience is a wretched thing, A torture fell, a worme that euer bites, A wound which is incurable, a fire Which alwaies burnes, and cannot be put out. But what Pandion, why talkest thou of this? Hast thou not sworne that thou wilt doe the fact? Doe it I will, let Dis; Death, or Reuenge Doe what they can, Ile surely doe the deed, Outragiouslie thus resolute he went, And caught in hand a knife, a fatall knife. And running where Alpinor was in hold, He found him making lamentable mone, In that he harmlesse should be forc'd to lie In such a pitchie Styx-resembling hole. Whom at the first this hel-hound did sooth vp, with sundry tearmes, and comfortable words. Like Mercurie, who plaid vpon his pype, Whilst hundred-eyed Argus he did kill. Then seeing time, pluct out his fatall blade, And hellish wretch, I quake to tell the deed, Pierc'd Lord Alpinor through the harmlesse side, And left him foltring in his guiltlesse blood. With all speed to Eristo then he ran, As though he had not knowne this hainous act: And said Alpinor hauing got a knife, Had stabd himselfe for feare of greater plagues: Fame had no sooner heard this forged tale, But she it sounded throughout all the coast: And now it was in euery peasants mouth, He slew himselfe fearing Palemons wrath. And now Palemon landed was in Greece: Whome old Eristo cunningly did meet, And what by letters he to him had told, In forged tales now to him he confest. I (saith he) to my mickle discontent, Espide them sporting on thy princely bed: When grieuing that thou shouldst be so abusde, I causde Alpinor foorthwith to be tooke, And cast him into prison, where outragiously, Fearing thy wrath; he butchered vp himselfe. Calingo can this testifie, his eies Beheld them both, exclaming out of them, This made Palemons late-receiued wound Bleed now more freshlie then it did at first: With fierie spurres of dire reuenge incenst, He would not once behold his wretched Queene. But vexed that Alpinor thus was dead, He swore by heauens and earth, and all the powers, Iulina should for both their treasons smart. He causd her therefore straitway to be throwne Into a deep and pitchie Stygian hole, I shake to tell, where Tytans fiery beames, Nor Lunas light was neuer seen to come: She lifting vp poore wretch, her hands to heauen, And to the Gods who knew her guiltlesse mind, O Fortune (quoth she) now doest thou begin To frowne on me, who euer erst hast faund! Shall I now lie among false impious slaues, Who guiltlesse am, and haue done none offence? Shall I now lie vpon the flinty stones, In steed of soft and downie fetherbeds? Shall now these armes be clogd with iron bolts, In steed of Gems, and bracelets of golde? Alas I haue patrated none offence, Or crime at all worthy these sauage plagues, Vnlesse when I forsooke mine aged Sire, To come to Greece, I did commit offence. But oh, I would amid the craggy rockes, And foming waues I might haue plagued bene, When I forsooke my care-oppressed Sire And followed false Palemon into Greece. But yet the gods I hope, for doubtlesse they Haue seene, and know my sin-detesting life, The Gods I hope, with neuer ending woes, And lasting tortures shall the tyrant plague. The day now came, wherin offenders should Be punished, according to the law; Iulina was brought out, and guiltlesse Queene, Among vniust and guiltie forc'd to stand. She lift her hands and heart vnto the skies, Heart neuer stain'd with thought of leud desire: Protesting that most innocent she was, And neuer had in thought done such a crime, But goe to (saith she) O thou tyrant fell, Kill, murther, slay thy chast and loyall wife, Death shall at length thy sauage torments end. Death shall at length these earthlie woes dispatch, But yet I trust to see thy gastfull ghost, With false Eristoes, tortur'd by Reuenge. Downe in a valley, neere the snakie Campe, With Stygian waues enuirond round about, Boyleth a chaldron with blew Sulphur flames, With sulphur flames, which neuer are put out, There standes Chimera with his gastfull armes, Armes massacring the sin-delighting ghosts: There sits a Iudge whose name is dire Reuenge, With vvhips in hand, and firebrands in his teeth, The Furies daylie vpon him attend, And poisoned toads, and serpents on him vvait: He, he it is vvhich vvill see me reueng'd On don Calingoes crime-concealing ghost. He, he it is, which will see me reueng'd Vpon the tyrant and Eristo false, And when thou shalt haue plagued me as thou wilt, And torne in sunder these my liuelesse lims, Ile followe thee a gastfull gloomi shade, And neuer will I leaue thee to pursue, Till I haue brought thee to Reuenge his mouth. Presumptuous whoore (quoth false Agenors sonne) How canst thou talke of innocencie now? Did not Eristoe and Calingo see Thee doe the crime? will Earle Eristo lie? What if they had not seene thee doe the deed, And thou thy selfe it also hadst denide? Why did Alpinor butcher vp himselfe? Why did he not first clear him of this crime? Wherefore goe to, go to my noble Peeres, Inuent some cruell torture for the vvhoore. Let her be burnt, what thing can be more plaine? What thing can be more manifest than this? Part of his Nobles did this sentence like And said, that she was worthy to be burnt: But yet it was a griefe vnto them all, That such a Queene should be so put to death, Till at the last, a graue and senile Earle, Who long had iudg'd in vertues rightfull seat, Inspired by the Gods, who saw her wrongs, Rose vp, and to Agenors ofspring spake. O mightie Prince, who in this famous land, Doest weare the crowne, and beare the royall mace, Whose dutie is to see all vice reform'd, And sinners to be punisht by the law. Thou hast condemn'd thy royall Queene to die, Accused by Eristoes sole complaint. He doth accuse, and she excuse her selfe, He moou'd with rage, and she to saue her life, Now if thou wilt haue her to see her fault, And all men know that she doth rightly die, Let her againe be sent to prison close, And send thou to the crime-disclosing God, Or Themis wife: she once declared how Lost humaine kind should be restorde againe. Apollo or wise Themis will declare, Her treacherous deed, so shall she iustly die. So shall she not plead guiltlesse as she doth. So shall all men condemne her for her fault. Palemon might full well haue bene condemn'd Ofrigor, should he haue mislik'd of this: To prison backe he sent Iulina chaste. Iulina, who with child was verie big, Which when Palemon saw, and did behold, Her womb, which sweld with ofspring therin closde, He sware by heauen, and all the Gods therein, The bastard brat should smart for Sires offence, Two Noble men were speedily sent foorth, To Themis Church, her Oracle to fetch, And she again to dreadfull dungeon sent, Exspecting alwaies when she should bring foorth. Th' exspected houre now came, she cride and gron'd, Intreating Iuno for deliuerance, Iuno releasde her, Iuno heard her sute, She on the flintes, no midwife helping her, O dolefull case!, a daughter sweet brought foorth, Soone brought Pandion keeper of the laile, These tidings to Palemon fretting king, He straightway charg'd him take the bastard brat, Throw't in a boat, and let it flote on seas: For so (saith he) by some sinister chance, Or death it shal for Sires offences smart. He foorthwith came, and told the wretched Queen, These heauie newes: who can expresse her mone? Thrise kist she her sweet babe, and dew'd the face With her Chrystalline pearl-resembling teares, Impatient, thrise of sorrow she fel downe, As though no life at all had bene in her. Ah little babe (quoth she) but euen now borne, And readie now to yeeld to cursed Fate. Shalt thou be fed with frothy salt sea fome, In steed of thy sweet mothers sugred milke? Shalt thou be rockt with windes and raging waues, In steed of milde and gentle lullabies? Alasse thy Sire, thy flintie-hearted Sire Will haue it thus, begotten of a Beare, Nurst with a sauage Tygers cruell milke, More cruell then blood thirsty Nero was. And now farewel, my haplesse babe, farewell, Yet let me kisse thy tender cheekes againe, The Gods I hope, the Gods will thee defend. Ah see how Nature worketh in mine heart, Here take with thee thy wretched mothers ring, A spousall gift the Tyger once her gaue. Take here this chaine, the tyrant me bequeath'd: Take here this purse which hath some golde in it. Fate better may perhaps for thee prouide, Then doth thy Sire, she wrapt them in a robe, And skarlet mantle. Now he tooke the babe, And caried it vnto the hoysting waues. The ruthfull mother when she saw it goe, Cride out and scrikt, renting her yellow haire, The child was now layd in a wherry boate, And it thrust off, which floted in the seas: Whom to the mercy of the quiet windes, And hushed waues a while I meane to leaue, And now teturne vnto the Grecian peeres. Who were at Themis Temple now arriu'd. They kneeling down vpon the Temple staires, With suppliant voyces thus deuoutly praide. Fore-telling Themis, Themis onlie wise, Disclosresse of al hid and vnknowne deedes, Who once didst tell Deucalion and his spouse, How lost mankind should be restord againe: Tel if Tuistons daughter, Queene of Greece, Hath done that crime whereof she is accusde, Tell if Alpinor late in prison slaine, Committed hath so bad and foule a crime, This said, vpon the Aulter fell a scrowle, And therewithall these words the Goddesse sent, Take what ye see, you Greekish Peeres, be gone, Vnseale it not before you come at home. They tooke it, ploughd the seas, and in short time Ar Grecia coast were set on land againe, Then kneeling downe, they humblie kist the scrowl, And gaue it to Agenors fierie sonne, He read it not straitway, but caused first. The wretched Queene from prison to be brought, Then caused he a stake to be set vp, VVherto the tyrant bound her hand and foote, Perswaded fully that she guiltie was. And there in flames should breath her latest breath, Then tooke, vnseald, and read the sacred scrowle, VVherein these words imprinted were in gold. Let reason rule in Princes, and not rage, What greater vice than lust in senile age. Iulina chast, Alpinor guiltlesse vvas: Calingo false, Eristo treacherous, Pandion wicked, and if Destinie Helpe not, Palemon issulesse shall die. Palemon hereat stroken was halfe dead, As one on whome Ioues thunderbolts haue falne, Abash'd he stood, not lifting vp his eies, Asham'd to looke vpon his guiltlesse Queene, Then quickly causde Eristo to be tooke, Pandion and Calingo traitors false: Eristo who sate erst in iudgment seat, Now guilty stood among the damned sort. And presently vnto them all confest, His villanie to chast Iulina wrought: And that because she would in no wise yeeld To leud desire, the slaunder he deuisde. And that Calingo hired of him was, To verifi't, and make it seeme a troth. And that he had Pandion moou'd with bribes, To slay Alpinor as he lay in Iayle: And so (saith he) I deem'd the matter would Without all doubt, haue neuer come to light. And damned wretch, what must I now exspect, But Sulphur flames and neuer-ending woes? Ay me now shall Chimera take these lims, And gripe them in his Adder-poysened armes: Through boyling Acheron now must I swim, And euer dying, neuer end my paines. Alas! I see Reuenge doth spur him on, With iron whips to massacre my lims: Deuouring vultures shall now teare mine heart, Mine heart, which as they eat, it shall encrease. With all speed therfore iudgement was pronounc'd, Against Eristo and his two consortes: And speedilie before Iulinas face. All massacred, their lims in fire burnt. The Noble men vnbinding their good Queene, Gan comfort her with delectable words, Affirming that Palemon did repent Him of the rigour he to her had showne. Which she might see in punishing her foes. Poore wretch, she cast her eies vpon the ground, Refusing on Palemon once to looke: Increasing riuers with her spring of teares: Her golden lockes once trimd with pretious gems, With furious hands now from her head she pluckt, Her eies which once like glittering Diamonds were, Now bleated were with fountaines of her teares: Her snowie cheeks, once intermixt with red, A yellow hue and ashie visage staind. Nought on her bodie now but bones were seene, A grieslie Ghost, and bony shape she seem'd, And in short time, out worne with fretting griefe, Death finished her miserable life. Palemon almost to the same estate, And miserie in sorrowing was brought, But that the Fates so had it not decreed, They did reserue him for some other cause. He buried her as did beseeme a Queene, In royall wise: al Greece did for her mourne. To Pallas Church her liuelesse corps were brought, And she in marble gorgiously intomb'd, On whome he causde this Epitaph to stand. Here lies Iulina, Germanies chast Queene, Tuistons daughter false Palemous wife: Accusde to be vnchaste, by Themis cleer'd, By rigour yet bereaued of her life. Her bodie plac'd within this Marble is, Her ghost in sweet Elysian fieldes in blisse. He hauing thus her funerals dispatcht, Liu'd in vast dolour, and perpetuall griefe, Sighing, and crying out against the Fates, Amid these woes whome now I meane to leaue, And make recourse vnto this little babe, Who now is floting on the surging seas. Long time it swam betwixt dispayre and hope, Doubtfull which waue should haue it ouerwhelmd, At length in Humber streames it forced was, Which mildly runs by sweet Arcadian downes, Long saild it here, and at the length it staid Among bul-rushes on the Reedy banks: Neere to this riuer stood a little house. whose roof was straw, whose wals wer willow twigs; And herein dwelt a simple country swaine, Whose name was Thirsis, wondrous poore &amp; bare. He hyred was to keepe old Damons heards, And keeping them neer to this pleasant stream As all alone he walked by the banks, He heard the infant cry for want of food, He ran to it, supposing it had been One of his lambs, hang'd in the marshy reeds, And comming neere, he saw the skarlet robe Lie in the boat, at first he was affraid: And started backe, as when a country man Espies a snake, yet by and by he durst Goe neerer it, then touched he the robe, And seing it to be a verie childe, He tooke it vp, from it tooke vp, there fell A chaine of golde, he almost dead with ioy, Did snatch it vp, and sitting on the grasse, Did ope the mantle, there he found a ring, And massie purse, he tooke them in his armes, And couering them with his old ragged cloke To Mepsa came, and thus to her he said, Come hether Mepsa, look what I haue got, An infant faire, a sweet and seemly childe: And who shall keepe vs when we two waxe olde, We haue no child, weel say that it is ours: Out knaue (quoth she) out cuckold-making rogue, Whoor-hunting slaue, bringst thou thy bastards here? Auauut thou knaue, thou arrant knaue, auant, Thinkst thou that I thy base-borne brats will keep, No, Mepsa scornes to mother bastards base, Though Thirsis counts it credit them to get. As though we two had nought to doe but play With brawling infants. Out whoore-hunting scab: Depart (I say) or els I sweare by Ioue, Ile make clubs trump, this distaffe shall bumbaste Thy lither loynes, and I will take the brat, And ding the braines against the flinty stones. He fearing her, thus mildly did entreat: Peace Mepsa, peace, good Mepsa be content, Hold still thy rocke: for euer we are made, See heere a chaine, which with it I haue found, See here a ring, and purse repleat with golde. Shee seeing it, ran vnto Thirsis strait, And gaue to him an hundred hungrie smackes: He doubled them as greedily againe. Long stood they kissing and rekissing thus: Then told to her his chaunce and luckie haps, That he them found on reedy Humber bankes, And now we must be silent wife (quoth he) Or els it wil be knowne vnto the king: Heele take from vs what Fortune hath bestowd: So shall we poorer be then ere we were. And that we may more surely it conceale, Harke to me wife, I haue deuisde a shift: When gloomie night expels the cheerefull day, And pitchie darknesse summons men to sleep, Faine thou thy selfe in childbirth to be pain'd, And piteously (as women vse) crie out: I presently will for the midwife run, And all our neighbors: as the custome is. Lay thou the child all naked at thy feet, And say thou hast brought it before they come, So shall ech one suppose that it is ours. So verie wel we may this thing conceale. This counsell pleased Mepsa very well. Night-bringing Hesper rul'd in dimmed skies: And Lunas Steeds gan cut the darkned aire, Now wearie corps with dayly toyle opprest, Gan soundly snort, amid their sluggish bed: But Mepsa mindfull of her late intent, Gan crie and call for Iunos speedy aid. Poore Thirsis ran, and piteously cride out, As though his wife had trauelled indeed, Help neighbours, helpe quoth he, my wife cries out, And now in child-birth dolefully is paind: Iana for haste, at threshold brake her nose: Fauella ran halfe naked through the street: But yet for al their speed they came too late, Mepsa brought foorth a daughter ere they came, And that she had brought forth they gaue all thankes. It bruted was in short time through the towne, That Thirsis wife a daughter sweet had brought. And no man thought but she her mother was, And he her Sire, so cunningly they wrought. And Thirsis now an hirelings wages scorn'd, He now disdaind to feed olde Damons heardes, He with his money bought him sheep and coats, And in short time grew to be verie rich. When Flora was some nine or ten yeeres olde, For so he nam'd the infant whom he found, She followed him, and bare his scrip and hooke, And learned how to feede his snowy heards. And as in age, so she in seemly shape Seem'd to increase, she waxed passing faire, No Shepheardesse within the Arcadian plaines, Was halfe so faire, as Mepsas Flora was. In summer time, when fiery Tytans beames Scortch'd cuntrie truls, with beautie-spoyling heat, With garlands braue she would adorne her selfe, And shadie boughs to keepe away the heat. Good Lord how many, when she came to age, Burnt in desire, and su'd to haue her loue. Wel-pyping Damon, with Amyntas came, Rich Melibeus, faire Alexis eke: A thousand more too long heere to recite, A woing came, all which she did repell. Her father would her oft times wish to wed, Her mother would to marrie her perswade, But mixing whitenesse with a skarlet hue: She would intreat them both to let her liue A Virgin still, for loue she did detest. Thus chastly liuing, and attending on Her fathers flockes, with many country truls, Menalchus sonne, a famous Grecian Earle, Came ryding by, saw her, and burnt in loue, And for her loue did make himselfe a Swaine. He after much intreating, did obtaine Her wished loue, and carried her away: When as, you heard, her father missing her, Ran after her, and would haue fetcht her backe, But he poore swaine, was also partner made Of their hard haps, and caried into ship, When floting on the seas, a sudden storme, And furious tempest brake their winged pine. The Grecian Knight disioyned from his loue, And by a boord drawn to a craggie rocke, A rocke whereon a little cell was built, Where Gods assisting, long time he remaind. Flora and Thirsis, cleauing on a bulke, At Delos land, Apollos Ile did stay: Where by the counsell of the Delian God, As late I told, they caried were to Greece: And now was Flora in her natiue land, Attending heards, where first she breathed life: Now was she in Palemons land her Sire, Her wofull Sire, which she full litle knew. Each day she vsde to keepe her fathers flockes, Still mourning for Cassander, her true loue: At length the Gods did pitie her estate, And Fortune who had seuen long winters frown'd, At seuen yeares end began on her to smile. Cassander comming from his seaish cell, As he was woont, his Citterne held in hand, And standing on the bottome of the rocke, Inchaunting fish with his melodious sound, His Instrument by chaunce fel from his hand, And carried was away by surging waues. He cried out, O Fortune, yet wilt thou Now with moe woes and torments me pursue? Wilt thou againe begin me to mollest, Who erst did thinke to make a slaue of thee. What shall I doe? Shall I depart from hence? And subiect be againe to Fortunes spight? No, no, I will not: in these furious seas, Ile cast my selfe, and end my lothed life: Loe now I die. What said I, I would die? What shall Cassander kill Cassander? no, He shal not do't. The Gods with endlesse plagues Will them inflict, which spoyle themselues of life. But yonder sailes a ship. O Mariners, Take pity of a poore distressed wight: Take pitie of one, whome Gods wrathfull ire Long time hath causde to liue on this cold rocke. They pittied him, and bending sayles and oares Vnto the rocke, did take him in on boord. He to the shipmen told his hard mishaps: Which causd them not to thinke their iourney long, And in short time, (for thither did they sayle) Their ship did land at olde Palemons Coast. Here was Cassander once a Grecian Knight, Set on the shore, it was his natiue soyle, Disdayning his inheritance to seeke, Or Fortunes giftes, but pilgrim-like he went. Now was poore Flora in her natiue land, Where both her Sire and Loue Cassander was, Yet neither of them knew where th'other was, Eristos sonne, a false and youthfull Earle, For villanie whose father martyrd was. Dryano cald, who only bore now sway, Next to Palemon in the land of Greece. In summer time vnto the grouie woods, Mounted vpon a Steed and Palfrey braue, Like Mars in valour, with a dart in hand, Went to pursue the wilde and sauage Boare. No sooner came he into bushie woods, But from a caue a fiery Boare rusht out: His eyes resembled aiery-lightening flames, His bristles stood like speares vpon his backe, A hoarie fome imbru'd his threatning iawes, His crashing teeth were able euen to make Couragious Mars to quake and shake for feare. Drlano first gan throw at him a dart; Which like a shaft against a flint redound, Then all his men their weapons did let flie, Darts flew as thicke as hailstones from the skies, The fiery Bore fomes, rageth, gnasheth teeth, And with his ire seemes euen to prostrate pines. They followed him and neuer left pursuit, Till they had laid his carcase on the ground. Ioyfull Driano with his merrie men, Returned now from slaughter of the Boare: And shunning Tytans heat, for it was hote, Rode home through groues, &amp; leaue-behanged shade Ah lucklesse Earle, an outward heat who shund, And purchased thereby an inward flame, Vpon his fiery palfrey as he rode, Accompani'd with all his sportitue men. He cast his eies on side, and saw by chaunce, Poore Flora sitting with her flocke alone, He saw her, and supposde no earthly impe, But that she some cœlestiall Nymph had bene, Her feature, ah her seemly feature pearc'd Him to the heart, so faire he thought she was. Homeward he rode vnto Agenors court, But thinking still vpon her shape diuine. He praisde her haire, her eies, her seemly face, Her visage sweet, her fingers small and long. Ah quoth he, what would she be if she were Bedeck'd with gems, in steed of leauie boughes, How would she looke if she in costly robes, VVere cloth'd, in steed of homely cuntry rags. But what Driano, what meanst thou, saith he, To talke of such a ragged cuntry drudge? If she like thee, thou maist commaund her loue. Command it? yea, and force her thereunto. Come Mylo, come, make haste, and shun delay, Doe what thy Lord Dryano bids thee doe, Go to that sweet-fac'd wench whom late I saw, Sit keeping sheepe, as we from hunting rode, Goe to her: tell her that I burne in loue: Say Lord Dryano likes thee woondrous well: And bring her with thee, which if she denie, (As she dares not, I hope) intreat thou her, And wooe her in my name as I know well, Thou canst it doe, and doubtlesse she will yeeld. He made all hast to doe his Lords commaund, And found her feeding grasse-deuouring heards. Faire maid saith he, Lord Dryan, whom ere while From hunting rode through these sheep-hanted fields, Inchanted with thine heart-alluring shape, And burning in thy loue, and sweet desire, Intreateth thee foorth with to come to him, I say Dryano, that renowmed Earle, Whose valiant heart, not Mars could make to yeeld, Now captiuated with thy comely forme, Confesseth him thy prisoner to bee. Come with me then, and yeeld to his desire, He'l vse thee well, thou shalt be his delight. Out paltry pesant, out whoor-seeking knaue, Goe seek (quoth she) thy master queanes els where: But tis no maruel though he loues an whoore, What's bred in flesh wil neuer from the bone. They say his Sire Eristo hanged was, For shundering a chast and guiltlesse Queene, He had but right, if he were hanged too: Who so delightes in seeking after whoores. Go tell Dryano that I scorne to loue The King himselfe, much lesse Eristoes sonne. Tell him that I a Vestall Virgin am, And will my vow'd Virginity still keepe. Goe cogging copesmate, tell th'adulterous Earle, That Violater of Virginitie. That Flora more esteemes a good report, Than all his glorie, fame, and courtly wealth. Poore Mylo nipt, went with a flea in's eare, And to his Lord recountred all her words, Told what opprobrious and reprochful tearmes, She had him giuen, and how she him contrould. Oh rascal (quoth he) what newes bringst thou mee? Couldst thou so heare thy Lord to be reuilde? Couldst thou heare him be scorned of a drugde, And country trull, and see it vnreueng'd? Goe villaine, slay, kill, stab, pierce through that hart That strumpets heart, which dares me so reuile. Why runs thou not? But stay, let her alone, With more than present death, I will her plague. Go Mylo, say thou heardst her swaynish Sire, That Soothsayer vile speake treason vnto thee, Say that he said, Palemon was by right No lawfull king, but did vsurpe the crowne. Say that that strumpet did the same affirme, And cause them both in prison to be cast. Ile warrant thee, my wordes before the king And thine shall be ynough to make them die. Poore Mylo runs, and causeth them foorthwith, By th'Officers in prison to be cast: They both exclaim'd, and knew no cause at all, Why so great rigour should to them be showne. They curse that ship, that shattred boord and bulke, Which sau'd their liues from drowning in the seas. But now the day that dismall day was come, Wherein offenders should receiue their doomes, The king himselfe as Iudge sate in the seat, For since the time he euer vsde to doe, Wherein his wife so falslie was accusde, Next him Earle Dryan false Eristoes soone. Cassander who now wandred pilgrim-like, From place to place, and had no one abode, Heard that the king himselfe in iudgement sat, And came to heare and see what there was done. When Thirsis and poore Flora were brought out, Accusde by Mylo treason to haue spoke. They did denie, he stoutly did approoue, And manifest the words before rehearst. They surely haue (saith false Dryano) spoke These treacherous words, or why should Mylo lie: He is my seruant, and long time hath bene, I haue had proofe of his fidelitie: I neuer yet in one thing found him false, And well I know no treason he will hide: And blame them not, though they themselues excuse, It doth concerne the losse of goods and liues. Palemon foorthwith mooued at his wordes, A fatall doome against them both pronouc'd, Condemning Flora to reuenging flames, And Thirsis on a gibbet to be hang'd. A gibbet was erected by and by, Where malefactors should receiue their bane: There faggots lay, wherewith offenders should, Which had deseru'd the fire, be iustly burnt. Cassander when he saw this sweet-fac'd maid To be condemn'd, waxt heauy in his mind: He knew her not as yet, but yet his face, His ashie face began to change the hue. Now Flora was bound to a fatall stake, And Thirsis mounted on a gibbet high, Each of them gan their latest words to speak, And first of them old Thirsis thus began. O mightie powers by whose most dreadfull doom, I crimelesse wretch, condemned am to die: Graunt now at my last gaspe, I pray you graunt That my clear ghost, which heauen &amp; earth do know Vnguiltie is of this so foule a crime, With spotlesse sprites may euer liue in blisse. And as for Flora, whom (vnguiltie wretch) You haue here made copartner of my doome, Whom all men thinke to be my childe, and whome I call my daughter, she me louing Sire. I now make knowne, for now I will disclose, My secretst thoughts, she is not mine owne child, But keeping flockes within th'Arcadian boundes, By Humber streames I found her in a boat. This Ring with her I found, which yet I weare, A chaine I found, which I haue left behind, And purse of gold, which gold I haue disburst. I brought her vp, and when she came to age, A Græcian Knight stole her away from me, I missing her, made after her straitwaies, And thought to fetch my sweetest child againe: But mercilesse he pluck'd me into ship, And caried me perforce with them away. VVhen suddenly a stormie Orion rose, Mangled our ship, and drowned him in deepe: VVe two by cleauing on a broken bulke, VVere brought by chance to sacred Delian Isle, And by Apollo both of vs were sent Vnto this land, vnluckie land of Greece, And now accusde vniustly, to haue spoke Most treacherous words against Palemon king, VVhich heauen and earth, and all therein can tell VVe neuer thought: and they, I hope they will Require our bloud at our accusers handes. Cassander when he heard old Thirsis tell This sugred tale, did leap for ioy in minde, His frostie lockes, his snow resembling haires, Gan change the cullour, and looke yellow now. And to be briefe, his face with red was deck'd, And look'd as yoong as euer he had done, So Venus did him metamorphose then. So Cupid did his Deitie make knowne. And now he surely knewe she was his loue. Scarce, ah scarce, could he then refraine himselfe. From kissing her, and taking her in armes: But yet perforce himselfe he did with-hold, And thought to see what further thing wold chance. Palemon harkened vnto Thirsis words, And caused him from gibbet to be brought, Inquiring of him at what time he found, The infant in a barke on Humber bankes. He told the time: Palemons heart gan leape, And willed him to shew the foresaid ring. He shewed it him, he strait way knew it was The verie ring which he gaue to his Queene. Then charg'd he to bring Flora vnto him: And ouercloyd with this so sudden ioy, Imbraced her fast in his aged armes: And kissing her, bedew'd her with his teares. O my sweet child, Iulinaes ofspring chast, My daughter sweet (quoth he) whom raging seas Tooke pittie on, and waxed mild and calme, With blustering winds did greete with gentle blasts And Eolus with pleasant lullabies: Who hast at length out-worn Fates frowning force, And not thought on, art found of me againe. Come with thy Sire, sport in thy fathers court, Palemons court. Now let Palemon die, Now let me post to chast Iulinas ghost, Sith I haue found mine ofspring now, her childe. Ay me (saith she) my noble king and Sire, For all this ioy, how can I sportiue bee, Sith by a villaine thus I am defam'd, Dryano lately as I fed my flockes, Past by mee, and enamored with my shape, Sent word to me, that I should to him yeeld: Whose messenger I with disdainfull words Sent backe againe to his detested Lord. And therefore to auenge himselfe on me, These slaunders false against vs both deuisde. Now then Pælemon, O if ere thou didst Loue that chast Queene, who was my mother deare, If thou doest loue thy new-found daughter now, Vpon these traitors let me be aueng'd. Kindled with rage he straitway caused them, To be arraign'd who strait the crime confest, Blood-thirstie ofspring (quoth this angry king) Lust-breathing traitors, progenie vniust, Whose father sought to violate my Queene, And nilling yeeld to his vnchast desire, Did slander her, and falsly her accuse, And therefore hanged was, as he deseru'd, And thou (his issue) treading in his steps, Hast not aberred from his treacherous actes, But slaundered hast her child, my daughter deare, In that she did thy wicked lust contemne, Now therefore as Pandion and thy Sire, Were iustlie martyrd for their foule offence. So Mylo and Dryano now shall be: A iust reward for all such traitors false. Then tooke they them before sweet Floras face, And hanged them in aged Thirsis place. Now saith Palemon, Daughter come to me, And frolike with thy father in his Court, Thou seest the traitors are already hang'd, What makes thee looke so sad, ah tel it me. Ay me saith she, what comfort can I haue Sith sweet Cassander drowned is in seas: He was my loue and I his sole delight: Would I were stil a Swaine, so that he liu'd. He liues (quoth he) and caught her in his armes, He liues (saith he) preserued from the seas: O my sweet Flora, art thou yet aliue? Tis thy Cassander which imbraceth thee. What tongue is able to expresse that ioy Which Flora made, when she beheld her loue? What Tullie can with eloquence declare, That ioy which he made, when he saw his loue? What Homer with his quaint Pernasius verse, In greekish stile, can halfe those ioyes expresse, Which olde Palemon made, when as he saw Cassander, his found daughters sweet delight? And woondrous glad that Flora had found out, So braue a Knight, sproong of so noble race, With great solemnity he wedded them. Deposde himselfe, and gaue the Crowne to him. He made olde Thirsis famous in the land, And much reuown'd through al his Greekish realm, Who sent for Mepsa, who was yet aliue, She came to him, to their immortall ioy. Ech one was glad, each one contented was, And long time liu'd, and dy'd in endlesse blisse. FINIS.</field>
