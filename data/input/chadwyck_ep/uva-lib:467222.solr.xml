      <field name="fulltext">THE SECRET OF POESY Wide must the poet wander To garnish his golden cells, For in Yesterday and in Yonder The secret of poesy dwells. It is where the rainbow resteth, And the gates of the sunset be, And the star in the still pool nesteth, And the moon-road lies on the sea. ANIMVLA VAGVLA Whither, O wandering feet? Why quit ye Paradise? Why seek a sweeter sweet, When Eden round you lies? The soul is a bird of air, That ever of flight is fain; And her wings areâWould I were there! AndâWould I were back again! SOVND AND SILENCE All night I heard the waterfall; The torrent shook my chamber-wall; I heard no other sound at all. Now, far from thence, where night is deep And noiseless, in mine ears I keep That thunder for a charm of sleep. AN ENGLISH EDEN Roses drop their petals all around In that enchanted ground, And all the air is murmurous with sound From the white-tumbling weir, So that all sounds or voices heard anear Do half unreal appear. As one, half-wakened from a dreamless sleep Is fain his thought to keep Thus floating ever 'twixt the night's black deep And the blank glare of day; So in that Eden pauses life midway 'Twixt dawning and noonday. THE WAVE Roll into gloom! Break into white! Thunder and boom In the caverns of night! Strong is thy wrath. Stronger thy fate, And a wind-blown froth Is the end of hate. THE MATTERHORN See how unmoved the rock-browed Matterhorn Taketh the rosy kissings of the Morn! Beneath him are the glaciers; for he throws Impatient from his head Heaven's softest snows And grinds them at his feet to steely ice, Spurning the chilly crowns of Paradise. Like some great human spirit in whose breast Nor heavenly love nor earthly e'er may rest. To endure is all. Love, hatred, friend or foe, Honour or scorn, are winds that come and go. Yet one who counts Love life, dare choose and love thee, Say why who can, above the heights above thee. ENCHANTMENT When Music, like a wizard's ring, Shuts for a while the world away, The soul unfolds a dainty wing, Forsakes her prison-house of clay, And poised above the fields of strife, With wing-beats soft as poet's rhyme, Watches the yeasty frets of life, And wild disordered waves of Time. A POET TO A MVSICIAN Why, my rare-sweet music-bird, Seek another song? Chaining it to rhyme and word Should thy rapture wrong. Wouldst thou steal but half thy soul From thine own sweet Muse? She I serve demands the whole, And the voice saysâChoose! TO A PAINTER Whoever opens me The secret of the earth, the sky, the sea, In the soft trance of song, Or painter's mirror-magic yet more strong; That voice, that hand I bless. For 'tis my heart's faith, to bring loveliness Is more than to bring ease, To make a soul more than to mend disease. BONA DEA No daughters of thine, Dear Mother, were they, The Muses nine Of an ancient day. They smote on lyre, They wrote with pen, They spake no higher Than the speech of men. Not these I serve By wood and stream, Where the waters curve And the summits gleam. No voice I hear, Nor vision see, But a soul draws near To the soul in me. MY WORSHIP For you the temple made with hands, And prayer an utterable word, And service as old use commands, And God a Presence seen and heard. Where'er man is not is my shrine, And Nature's face my book of hours; Some larger Spirit embraces mine, And prayer mounts as the breath of flowers. A CLAY IMAGE Till ye can tell me why Yon cloud-web in the sky Mocks the lace-weaver's dainty-fingered pain; Why no inlayer's art So whispers to the heart As 'neath the maple the leaf-chequered lane; I cry against your creed That Man is Lord indeed, Judge of his own due and his Maker's duty; Nor own that ye have wrought The Godhead of your thought More true to Deity than Art to Beauty. THE NATVRE-LOVER The stars, the seas, the mountains, are they only Mirrors of Man? and is the landscape lonely And loveless in your eyes unless ye mark The smoke-wreath rising, or the white-sailed barque? Ah, happier souls, that love the solitude Where Man comes rarely and no voice is rude! These find no footsteps where no feet have trod, And hear woods whispering the thoughts of God. THE PASSING OF WINTER A leaden sleep the world oppressed, The day was dark with rain; The low-browed windows of the west Opened ere day did wane. The sun with golden fingerings Touched the slant-falling drops, And lo, ten thousand silver sirings Made music through the copse. A SPRING PARABLE Where the last year's seed lay sleeping Cold and calm, See, two tiny leaves are peeping, Palm to palm. So let hands in prayer long-pressing Then outspread, Duly to receive the blessing Duly shed. A DEAD LEAF AND A DAFFODIL I saw the golden daffodil By a leaf-girdle bound, A withered oak-leaf, her soft will Had lifted from the ground. Alas, poor leaf! a poet's tongue Shall voice thy misery: âHad Love come so when I was young, And meet, sweet flower, for thee!â INSCIA REGINA Ever blossom, and never fruit! Vain the effort of leaf and root, The joy of sunlight, sorrow of rain, The winter's patience, the knife's sharp pain! Sighed the pride of the garden so, Sighed the Rose, and did not know Only to be the Rose is more Than all the apples that Eden bore. EVENING SADNESS The last breath of the dying day Has kissed the dying rose; And in the air a soft despair Grows, as the starlight grows; For all the beauty that daily dies, And cometh again no more; For every day is a once-played play, And vainly we cry Encore! A CHANCE WOVND âLike love too late returning comes the rain Vpon the hopesick land; How can the yellowing leaves grow green again, Or perished buds expand?â Idly I spoke; but in her eyes I read I know not what of yearning; And very softly to herself she said:â âLike love too late returning!â AVTVMN SINGERS When woods are gold and hedges gay With jewelled Autumn's brief array, And diamonds sprinkle every spray, The robin sings His soft melodious well-a-day For dying things. Yet often, when a riotous night Has ruined all the wood's delight, There breaks a Spring-day warm and bright, And the thrush sings, As if his April were in sight, Of quickening things. THE TREASON The birds of the Summer are flown Beyond the sea; The leaves of the Summer are blown From hedge and tree. But the winds of the Summer proclaim, With recreant breath, (O traitors, have ye no shame?) The triumph of Death. OFFERINGS Where breaking waves have kissed the sand, Are fading wreaths of foam, The sea's last offering to the land Ere the voice called him home. They die uncared-for at her feet, Bitter and poor and grey; A thousand roses red and sweet Wreathe her head far away. VIBRATIONS What wonder if, when Love awakes Suddenly, the tense heart breaks? As at the organ's thundering Snaps the lute's responsive string. Ah, sadder heart, where Love has grown Stealthily, his name unknown! As quietly some soundless air Awakes the wind-harp to despair. A DAY OF LOVE Dear is the sunny between-while Of April skies, Though black with storm in the meanwhile The clouds arise. Tho' the clouds that shall burst on the morrow Be gathering above, So dear in a year of sorrow Is a day of love. A CHARM OF SLEEP England holds her; She is not over sea. The same night folds her Whose darkness falls on me. The same stars shining With silent dewy eyes From day's declining Do watch her till day rise. A YEAR AGO Yes, I was walking yonder Only a year ago, But the blue of heaven was fonder, More white the snow. A year? nay, the sun burns colder; 'Tis a million years are fled, And the old Earth is Ã¦ons older, And Love is dead. NON IMMORTALIS AMOR To-day within my heart A green grave opened, and dead Love arose; We wandered as of old in woods apart, As fair as those. But of that joy I drew No draught not bittered with this misery, That having found him mortal once, I knew That Love can die. THE WANDERER There stood a girl with a golden key At the gate of Paradise; A rose she gathered and gave it me; Alas! I was not wise. She walketh where the lilies shine; I go where the wind goes; Hers is the key of Eden, mine The world and a withered rose. VARIVM ET MVTABILE Lips, that taught me to revere Love, would have me now profane it; Eyes, that shewed me Heaven clear, Bid me doubt now or disdain it. Girl, you know not what you do! You can change not Love nor Heaven. For her sake who once was you, She who is you be forgiven! AN ETERNAL MOMENT Here there is rain &amp; dead leaves whirling? I hear not, see not. In mine eyes Is sunlight, in mine ears the swirling Of snow-fed waters. Which are lies? Ah, living dream! The cloudlike splendour Of Monte Rosa far above; And at our feet the Alp-flowers tender, A thousand blue eyes looking love. A DREAM-HAVEN Where is my soul to-night? Around me Were friendless streets and loveless eyes; The naming of thy name unbound me, I fled to sapphire lakes and skies. Where is my soul? far yonder, singing With nightingales 'neath starlit trees? Or here, bereft and songless, wringing Joy drop by drop from memory's lees? ANIMA CAPTIVA I was halfway to Heaven, the stars Were large and low above me, Forgotten all earth's bonds and bars, No heart to hate or love me. Love me!âalas, the word! At this The waning world re-brightened; Ev'n at the very gates of bliss The tether of earth was tightened. A NOCTVRNE A svdden wind has rent the veil That hid the heaven from me; The white moon spreads her silver sail, And swims the jewelled sea. She brings me dreams of thee in freight; Oh, would she take of me My fancies down the milky strait, What dreams she'l bring to thee! PRIMITIÃ AMORIS Yon shining top, that taketh The sun's first kiss, No sad lamenting maketh To be not his, But with the whole world share The noon's exceeding glare. O love! the first sweet kisses Live on the lips, Through many-partnered blisses, Through love's eclipse, Through all life takes away, Through all that death can pay. STELLA STELLARVM O star of all the stars! O face Of all the faces! In thine eyes Now seems it better to find grace Than to be great or wise. A thousand other stars might shine, A thousand faces fair might be, And hold me to the earth; but thine Has opened Heaven to me. A WASTED WORD I was a fiddler playing Alone to a crowded hall; And what my fingers were saying No one knew of them all. I love you! I love you! I love you!â I played it soft and loud; And you were there and heard it, And knew no more than the crowd. THE FIRST NIGHTINGALE Song of the singing-bird Over the sea, Heard, and yet hardly heard, While bush and tree Sleep yet, and keep yet their new robes for thee. See, but the snow-thorn Hath put on her snows, The thorn-guarded sloe-thorn. Oh, safely in those Nest thee, and rest thee, and wait for the rose! THE RETVRNING In the sea is a song, In the wind a sweet whisper, And the wavelets along The low sand-waste run crisper, For the wind and the sea Have a message to me: âWe are bringing, are bringing thy love back to thee!â The dying stars saidâ She hath done with our guidings; And the dawn blushing red On her sails brought the tidings; And the wings far at sea Waved white signals to me: âShe is coming, is coming, thy love back to thee!â THE WASTE GARDEN In a garden I had planted (my heart, I say, my garden) A lily-flower of Eden so delicately fair, That when I first beheld it I knelt and wept for pardon To God who had created a loveliness so rare. A wind of desolation has wasted all my garden, (My heart, I say, my garden) and where the lily shone Is a phantom black and evil. What wonder if I harden My heart, or leave it fallow and let the weeds grow on? FEAR O hvnted eyes that haunt my dream, Because before my harmless tread Some timid creature of the stream To-day in terror fled! Dame Nature hath us all at school; We live and move by laws austere; But of all sanctions of her rule The most abhorred is Fear. THE ANT IN THE HOVR-GLASS From under our feet are falling For ever the sands of Time; Hardly with slow feet crawling One step higher we climb. This day and that we o'ercome itâ The sinking vortex of sand; And the hour we reach the summit The end is near at hand. SALVAGE Wrovght from the wreck of suns The little round earth runs A world life-freighted 'mid the lifeless ones; A raft upon the deep Where some few ship-wrecked keep A little salvage from the gulfs of sleep. So is Love left amid Suns darkened and moons hid, Sole salvage of the foundered hope of youth, A life more frail than life, By strife o'erliving strife, The only glory and the only truth. STILL WATERS The wind at its loudest Has whispers half heard, And the heart at its proudest Will break at a word. At a word rightly spoken, A voice from dead years, The deep is up-broken, The man melts in tears. THE REFVSE A leaf has fallen; all Summer It danced in delight to see The vision of its green beauty In the deep pool under the tree. Now the river bears it rolling, Rolling on to the sea. A life is ended; a woman, Who once was fair to see, Has chosen the death of the river. Is the leaf more missed, or she? And the river is rolling, rolling, Rolling on to the sea. A STRAY BENEDICTION Is there a wind Of the winds of heaven For a soul that has sinned To be kissed forgiven? An answer straying From some child's prayer To a soul past praying That has sinned somewhere? VOICES A sovlless thing is the Sea; But somewhere in Heaven or Earth must be A soul titanic and torn with agony, That cries so loud in the Sea. A sinless thing is the Wind; But somewhere a spirit is that hath sinned, A passionate outcast, unrepentant and blind, Who wails so wild in the Wind. THE CALL The topmost towers of the night At noon are under our feet. If the depth be as the height, Is Heaven a cheat? How climb to a star that falls Or ever the feet come near? Hark! from the Infinite calls:â Climb! I am here! REFRESHMENT OF THE SOVL Father unseen, whose hand I feel In earth and sea and skies, When knowledge opens seal by seal And man grows proudly wise, And more and more beneath his heel Fair ruined Nature lies; Oh, lead me in some lonely spot Where simple wood-flowers blow; And as I ask for whom, for what So wonderful they grow, Whisper my soulâMan knows it not, And may not hope to know. AN AWAKENING A rose above the gateway hung, A rose of Paradise; And as I passed, the petals flung Their sweet dews on my eyes. Darkened the world and its desire, My naked sin I see. Oh, is it balm, or burning fire, This grace that falls on me? NEARING THE END Over my head that wave! Once I had topped a greater. One must be my grave; What matters now, or later? What gain or loss of me, Say, if I die to-morrow? Less by one soul shall be The vast sum of Earth's sorrow. FAILVRE From the light of Love behind me Falls the shadow of my soul On my pathway, to remind me I have passed, not won, the goal. For behind me is the glory, And before me is the gloom, The unknown end of the story, Darkness, solitude, and doom. THE BOOK OF PSALMS The rivers of a rainless land, Which some far rain-world fills, Go whispering through the leagues of sand How blessÃ©d were the hills. And we who walk a godless earth Beneath a giftless sky Drink living waters that had birth Where Earth and Heaven were nigh. JOHN RVSKIN Qvenched is the lamp, ev'n in its flickering dear; We miss the light, we would not have him here; No carping littlenesses lift their head Where he is, 'mid the great unjealous dead. He thirsted, as a thirsty land for rain, For Beauty, and for Good as men for gain; Now may he drink of the immortal tide, Ever athirst and ever satisfied. THE PEOPLE OF ROSSETTI'S PICTVRES They are not of this common day; They are not of our human clay; I know not what they are nor who; Their world is very far away; But whence they are my soul is too, And thither seeketh, her life through. OMNIA PVRA Lo, the maid-moon now, as a queen ashamÃ©d, Gathering light clouds to her like a garment, Rideth no more an unabashed Godiva Naked in heaven. Nay, the thought wrongs her! there is none in Nature, Saving Man, so dares to rebuke the Maker, Hiding as shameful the Eternal Artist's Exquisite artwork. TIME A tide that floweth, but doth never ebb; A pen that writes, but leaves no written tale; A loom that weaves, but none can see the web; A kindly lord with whom no prayers prevail; A thief who taketh what he cannot use; A bell that striketh, but we hear no chime; A friend or foe according as we choose; Thus may we paintâbut who can picture?âTime. JANVARY Here and there a song bird in the hedges, Here and there a primrose in the lane; Tarry, eager Spring, till all the ledges Of the white-streaked hills are green again! Tarry, eager flowers, eager thrushes! Hardly yet forget we our dead year, And your blithe notes, ere the new spring blushes, Are as sounds of revel round a bier. FEBRVARY Between the winter and the spring, Between the snows and the flowers, On leafless tops the thrushes sing To the lengthening evening hours. And all the land is wet with rain, And floods reflect blue heaven; Hope is the morning-star again, And Love the star of even. MARCH Like a fair novice who forsakes the world Vntasted yet, Taketh her veil of snow the half-unfurled White violet. At eve, a too-late lover, warm and red The sun appears; How may she greet him save with drooping head And icy tears? APRIL In blue and silver came the morning, Earth in the lap of Heaven lay, And I could almost hear the angels Who broke the shadows and brought the day. Every year is the gate of Eden Opened, and all the earth made fair; And every year is the old tale acted, And sons of Adam bring sorrow there. MAY Oh, to be a wood-bird Singing to the sunset In the month of May! Oh, to be the singer, Sweet and true and perfect, Of a golden day! Hope nor fear before me; Just the very moment All in all to me! Oh, the benediction! Who hath ears to hearken, Who hath eyes to see? JVNE The rose is in her place to-day, The nightingale on her old spray; Come live a moment while you may Simple as bird and flower! To-morrow leave, and yesterday! Count but the actual hour! Lock up the chambers of your brain! Your pencil and your pen refrain! Your labour shall not give again The ecstasy of June; Nor all your schemes for joy or gain Revive so vast a boon. JVLY Now is the greenwood all a sanctuary, Dim-lighted, faint with incense, whispering With sighs; the columned aisles are solitary, And all the choristers have left to sing. O paths of peace no worldling may discover! Now comes no sportsman, nor bird-nesting boy, Nor primrose-raider. Nature waits her lover Alone nor of her inmost heart is coy. AVGVST The year has reached the swooning-day Of perfected desire, The crowning of the hopes of May, The height that hath no higher. Her myriad children round her throng, Flower and bird and bee. Ah, nightingale! why fails thy song? Is joy for all but thee? SEPTEMBER As a fair maid grown To a mother fair, When years have flown, Takes back unware Some touch or tone Of her maiden air; So doth the year, When the summer wood Shows one leaf sere, Doff matron-hood, And awhile appear In her April mood. OCTOBER Green leaves or golden Which love you best, New loves or olden, O swallow, sweet guest? The warm airs that wake you And waft you hither? The dark winds that take you We know not whither? NOVEMBER A time there is for laughter; This is the time for tears, To look before and after, And number the flying years. When the low red sun sets early, And the fog hangs heavy and white, And at noon the meads are pearly With the undried tears of the night. DECEMBER The joy of the year is over, The dead leaves fill the air; No voice in copse or cover, Nor one flower anywhere. Call, robin, call, from the garden wall! Sing of the spring to be! Call, robin, call! Tho' the red leaf fall The red breast shines on the tree.</field>
