Married to Juetta, the Widow of a neighbouring Knight (90): Her Temper and Disposition (116). Hilda, her Waiting Woman, her Character (176). Murdac, chief Manager of the Country Affairs: Account of him, and his little Daughter Clara by his deceased Wife (198). Hilda's View to marry him. Hubert, an active young Fellow, chief Manager of Domestick Affairs: Character of him (222). Description of the Summer House (268). Hilda and Hubert walking, she, to serve him a Trick, appoints to meet him at Six that Evening in the Summer House: they part (280): Hilda returns to the House; finds Clara in the Farm Yard: Description thereof (308). Description of the Parlour (352). Dinner over, and Company gone, as Galfred, Juetta, and Clara, are sitting in the Parlour, an odd Accident puts them all into a strange Combustion (362). All quiet again. The Clock strikes Six; and Hilda, mindful of her Assignation, repairs to the Summer House (440). Description of the Evening, and threatening Storm (452). Meets Hubert there: opens the Door: then locking him in, returns to the House (464): Goes into the Kitchen, where Galfred's Labourers were all met: Description of them (486). Galfred and Juetta sup (522). She enquires for Hubert: Hilda excuses his not being there, by sudden Illness. The Night coming on: it blows and rains hard (548). A sudden Alarm from a Rapping at the Wicket; where, upon opening, they find Oswald, who gives them an Account of a strange Apparition and Disturbances at the Summer House, which puts them all in a terrible Consternation. Account of Galfred Hall being long troubled; and the haunted Room (594). Galfred, and the rest, sit about the Fire talking of Spectres, &amp;c. till they retire to Bed (610). The Tempest increases, with Thunder and Lightning (658). While all in Bed, a fresh Disturbance strikes them with Terror: Accounted for by the Adventure of Eustace and Maud in the Kitchen (680). Calm again (700). 'Tis known, by all Records of Fame, That Men and Manners are the same: That all the Animal Creation Are in a just Subordination: And all before, and since, the Flood, Were made, like us, of Flesh and Blood: Tho' Men and Women, of all Sizes And Constitutions, love Disguises, These Prudence only did invent, For Nature still will have it's Bent. This, History evinces well; And good Tradition, too, can tell. But as of Grain, from Measures ample, A Handful is enough for Sample, So, from the Mass of Nature's Store, A few will serve to shew her Pow'r: And here's a Tale, your Shelf may keep, At Random taken from the Heap: Within the Wilds of Kent, renown'd; For Wealth and Yeomen, all around, Far distant in a Vale retir'd, For richest Pasture much admir'd. There liv'd a Farmer old and bald, And honest Galfred was he call'd; From worthy Pedigree deriv'd When Norman William first arriv'd, Whose Ancestors did make a Shew Some seven Centuries ago, When Champions dar'd, for Love or Right, In Tilts and Tournaments to fight, When Glory was the only Bait For Men of Rank or high Estate, Who from Portcullis issu'd forth To shew their Valour and their Worth, And, clad in Steel, in dreadful Battle, With hardy Blows did thund'ring rattle. But as by Folly or Misdeeds Some lost their Lands, and some their Heads, For fear of being quite bereft, He wisely manag'd what was left, And rightly chose for his Retreat His moated old paternal Seat, In which the Vestiges were seen Of Living, that before had been. The Structure large, without, around, With lofty Battlements was crown'd, Which spreading Ivies Shades surround. A Buttress here and there supports The mould'ring Walls that front the Courts, With narrow Casements, that admit The glimm'ring Light as thro' a Slit. When enter'd thro' the Porch, is plac'd A spacious Hall with Trophies grac'd, Whose Oaken Sides suspended bear The Helmet, Shield, and pointed Spear, And Heads of Stags, with Antlers wide Extending large on either Side; With various Arms, in Order hung, That shew'd from whence the Galfreds sprung. Hence, sev'ral Ways, the Entries lead To various Rooms, for Use decreed, Whose Ornaments of Gothick Taste Profusely spread, with Gloom o'ercast; The Panels small, the Chimnies wide, With monstrous Masks on either Side: Above, the massive Beams extend, With pond'rous Bulk, from End to End, O'er which, with Modes of antique Cast The Chambers of Repose are grac'd. Within the Garden, which was small, Inclos'd with partly Hedge and Wall, In various Ranks of Order grew The Holly, Bays, and baleful Eugh; Where flow'ring Shrubs, of rankest Kind, The narrow-border'd Albeys lin'd; And crowded Trees projecting, made, With unlopp'd Growth, a solemn Shade. To mark the Center, stood alone A lumpish Figure, carv'd in Stone, Whose Giant Form, with hideous Grace And Aspect grim, adorn'd the Place Ill suited, in a Bason fix'd With Spawn of Frogs and Duckweed mix'd. Here Galfred took the Morning Air To free his Lungs, and banish Care: And here, by Sev'nty Years of Quiet, From Company, Debauch, and Riot, He now became, by frugal Care, The most substantial Farmer there. With Ease and Plenty pamper'd long, Old Galfred found himself yet strong; And fond, as Dotards often are, To get or find a hopeful Heir, Resolv'd to change his future Life, And form'd the Project of a Wife: But careful not to bring Disgrace To blot the Honour of his Race, He chose in Prudence, as was right, The Widow of a neighb'ring Knight. The Lady, handsome, plump, and straight, Might still unruly Thoughts create, And being warm in Disposition Ill relish'd first the Proposition; For tho' her Virtue was rever'd, It was by Inclination steer'd, And Rumour spread, do all she cou'd, Nature wou'd follow, still, her Road, Which made it irksome to engage With fumbling Impotence and Age; And being neither old nor young, Cou'd hardly brook the Smell of Dung, But, fond of Wealth and Power too, Resolv'd to live as Ladies do, And as the Stock cou'd not degrade, The Jointure fix'd, the Match was made. Juetta, so this Lady's Name, Was of a nice and tender Frame; Who, in her former Husband's Days, Must always have her settled Ways, And, by habitual Love of Ease, Had really got a strange Disease, Which none cou'd tell us what to call, Unless it were Histerical; A motly Ail, of Mirth and Sadness, Of Folly, Dumps, of Flights and Madness, Of all Distempers most severe, For all, in this, at once appear. Sure Women all, from last to first, Are fated to be most accurst. 'Tis hard to say what Ills perplex And persecute the Female Sex, When Want of Rest, or Dreams, by Night, Disturb, distract, deceive, or fright; When Appetite is bad or dull, Or when the craving Belly's full; Or when the contradicting Air Is hot, or cold, or foul, or fair; When Colick gripes, or Puppies bark, Or Lights are wanting in the Dark; When, thro' the Keyhole of the Door, The saucy Wind pretends to roar; When simple Dogs presume to howl, Orâwhat no Creature oughtâto foul; When vulgar Stinks the Nose offend Of Pitch, or Paint, or Candle's End, The Maid is call'd, to know the Meaning, And bid to smell, or sent to cleaning. To remedy, in Cases urgent, Like such as these, the most emergent, Juetta, always had, at Hand, Fine Surfeit Water at Command; And, as the Circumstance might vary, Good Brandy, Anniseed, and Clary, With Juleps, Draughts, and Cordial Drops, For tott'ring Strength, the ready Props: Tho', often, Palliatives like these But serve to heighten the Disease; And strange Emotions, then, betray'd Desiresânot easy to be laid. With such Infirmities opprest, Galfred, at first, had little Rest; But found it vain to cross her Will, As Woman wou'd be Woman still: And therefore, rightly, acquiesc'd In all she said and did, as best: Hence, mutual Liberty ensu'd, And each their fav'rite Schemes pursu'd. Juetta nothing was debarr'd, But, ever, his Indulgence shar'd: No eager Fancy was deny'd, But all her Wishesâsoon suply'd: While Galfred's woollen Cap became Familiar to the gentle Dame, Who, chearfully prepared the Physic To ease his Cough, and help his Phthisick. Hilda, a fair, but wanton Jade, Was chose to be Juetta's Maid, A merry, artful, coming Lass, As pliant as the yielding Grass, Who never scrupled to comply With any Motionâby the By; Who, to procure her Mistress' Grace, Cou'd change the Muscles of her Face, Do as she pleas'd, or wrong or right, And boldly say, thatâBlack was White: In all her Secrets, close and sly, Cou'd sawn and flatter, weep and lie. Nor was her Artisice in vain Her Master's Favour to obtain; For when his latent Warmth arose From Beauties Hilda did expose; As when her Breasts, those Snares of Love, Did tempt his Hands, by stealth, to rove, The harmless Dalliance, well she knew Wou'd bring Esteem and Profit too: But Hilda's Views much higher rose, As by and by we shall disclose. In Galfred's Service, there was one Murdac by Name, a perfect Clown, Whom, twenty Years before, he hir'd To do the Bus'ness he requir'd, And, as a Husbandman profest, Preferr'd him much before the rest; But saw no farther than his Nose, And gath'ring Muck, âno higher rose. His Wife, a blooming Wench, was made By Favour, too, a Dairy Maid; And Rumour said, the rampant Hussy Had been with Galfred much too busy: Howe'er it was, she prov'd with Child, And Clara was the Infant stil'd: But as untoward Fates decide, Within the Month the Mother died: Whetherâby nat'ral Instinct mov'd The prattling Girl he, dearly, lov'd: And now, the little Clara grown, They treated, both, as if their own. By Ways, like these, Men often live, And this made Murdac rich, and thrive; And, therefore, Hilda thought it best To feather well, by him, her Nest. Now, to proceed, in Thread of Story, And lay wild Nature's Pranks before ye, 'Tis fit we mention Hubert here, An arch young Wag, as will appear, Who, by his Industry and Spirit, Had gain'd much Confidence and Credit, Was Brewer, Serving Man, and Steward, Paid all the Bills, and all procur'd; Made the Metheglin and the Perry, To warm their Hearts, and make them merry: Cou'd shoot, and course, and lay a Snare For Partridge, Woodcock, Snipe, or Hare: Was late and early, often, out To troul for Jack, or whip for Trout: Knew how to break a Horse or Dog, Cou'd geld a Lamb, or kill a Hog; In short, in ev'ry thing of useâ But rattling, giddy, wild, and loose; By Nature form'd in such a Fashion As hard to bear a strong Temptation; Well qualify'd, alike, to give Impressions, he did oft receive: For many Girls, about, did prove The Feats that he perform'd in Love; And many a ruddy Boy, in Haste Wou'd d'off his Cap, when Hubert pass'd. But Hilda's Charms did most inspire The ardent Embers of Desire; With eager Warmth he made his Suit To gain her by his warm Pursuit, For well he knew the skittish Puss Did love to toy, and romp, and buss: And true it is, if known her Mind, To Hubert she was most inclin'd, But Int'rest sway'd the crafty Baggage To mind her Paces well, and Carriage, And, therefore, all his Arts defy'd, In hopes of being Murdac's Bride; For well she knew, that silly Oaf Cou'd never missâa slice from Loaf; Yet teas'd by Hubert, o'er and o'er, To recommend her Virtue more, And stop Pursuits, at such a Time, Which, afterwards, she thought no Crime, She fram'd, by Genius Politick, This subtle Bait, but jilting Trick. West of the Garden Wall, there stood A Summer House, upon the Road, Which, Dungeon-like, without, expos'd A Building square of Flints compos'd, Whose gaping Joints, their Cement gone, Were, with the vary'd Moss, o'ergrown; Within, on Cobweb Walls, appear A Crowd of Distichs, here and there, With Dates of Years in ev'ry Place, And Names of Galfred's ancient Race; Now, unfrequented, dark Abode Of Spiders, Bat, and crawling Toad. Near this, as Hubert, once, was walking With Hilda round the Waist, a talking, He push'd so far his brisk Approaches (As Love encourag'd, oft encroaches) That, doubling Strength, at last, said she, âHubertâno moreâour Thoughts agree; âA faithful Love deserves Regard, âAnd yours shall find its just Reward: âBut, as you know how much I fear âThe Consequence, should ought appear, âHave Patience till the Night comes on; âI'll meet you here at Sixâaloneâ âWhen, if you'll promise to be civil, âAnd tempt me not to any Evil, âWee'll to this Summer House repair, âAnd spend an Hour, together, there; âBut now, dear Hubert, let me go, âFor I have Bus'ness, yet to do.â Hubert, whose Heart with throbbing panted For promis'd Joys he so much wanted, Reply'd,ââMy Dear, 'tis now I find âMy gen'rous Hilda good and kind; âRely on me,âand never fear, âBe you but punctual,âI'll be there.â This said, her rosy Lips he kiss'd, And on her rising Bosom press'd, When, fearing, both, a longer Stay, They, parting, took a diff'rent Way. As by the Farming yard she went (On her mischievous Project bent) That sweet Assemblage of Delight, So pleasing to the ravisht Sight, Where, on the Dunghill, proud, at Morn, The Cock turns up the Barley Corn, And clucking, calls, with strutting Air, His feather'd Family, to share: The Pigs, on Heaps of Straw, are lying, And Pigeons from the Dovehouse flying; The Ducks, and Ducklings waddling a'ter, With Geese, are sporting on the Water: Where brindled Cows are eating Fodder, And Blanche is stroaking of the Udder: While Thumps of Flail, repeated, warn That Hodge is threshing in the Barn: With Stacks of Wood, and Ricks of Hay, And Hovels thatch'd the Country Way: (That Seat of Innocence and Health, Of honest Labour, Joy, and Wealth;) The little Clara, here, she spies, With gaping Mouth, and staring Eyes, Amaz'd to seeâin rampant Mood. A Bull and Cowânear where she stood; Who seeing Hilda come, in Haste She ran, and clinging round her Waist, With little Fingers, pointing yonder, Bid her beholdâthe striking Wonder; On which she quickly, with Surprize And strong Attraction, fix'd her Eyes, 'Till having seen the whole Transaction, Was now dispos'dâto move to Action, And taking Clara by the Hand, Who, longing, wish'd to understand The Meaning of this wond'rous Sight, (For Wonders Children much delight) Along they pass'd:âWhile Clara's Prattle Was, stillâthe Subject of the Cattle: For all her Search, in vain, descry'd, Why Cows with Double Tails did ride; Which Hildaâby th'Impression blinded Of cogent Natureâlittle minded: And thus, at length, they gain'd the House, Unseen by Galfred, or his Spouse. The Parlour, where they both had din'd, With ancient Portraitures was lin'd, Where flat and pallid Tints betray'd The Infancy of Light and Shade; Yet awful look'd, with rev'rend Mien, In Gothick Garb,âwith Galfred's Chin; Upon the chequer'd Glass appear'd The blazon'd Coats, with Colours smear'd; And, here and there, where Daylight peep'd, The tendrill'd Vine luxuriant crept. 'Twas now the Time, when, after Meals, The Nerves are brac'd and Belly swells, That with October fill'd, and Plenty, Not One is easy found in Twenty: When Stock of Farms are bought and sold, And all the Jokes, and Stories, told: With bloated Faces, red with quaffing, Some yawning stretch, and some are puffing; The Pipes all out, and Dinner done, And all retir'd, one by one, Thro' dirty Ways, to reach their Houses, With Liquor ripeâto vex their Spouses; The Visiters withdrawn.âNow, Diet With heavy Lids, dispos'd to Quiet, When Galfred, in his Easy Chair, Repos'd at large from Pain and Care; Where, when he had enjoy'd his Nap, With Clara sitting on his Lap, She stroak'd his Beard, and 'gan to tell The Wonders in the Yard befell. On perching Stand the Parrot sate, And on the Chimney's Side, the Cat; Juetta, as the Time was fitting, Had laid aside her Work and Knitting, And made the Coffee, to dispel The Fumes arising from the Meal; When, 'fore the Fire, as Duchess stood, The fairest of King Charles's Brood, And Pompey, one of Galfred's Pack, Was mounted, wriggling, on her Back, A Spark flew out, by Destination, Between the Parts of Proc??????n: Away the yelping Creatures slew, And all the Crock'ry overthrew, With Tables, Chairs, and, by Mishap, The Coffeeâin Juetta's Lap. Juetta scream'd, the Parrot bawl'd, Old Galfred laugh'd, and Clara squall'd; With Laughter, Galfred's Cough provok'd, He'd very near, indeed, been choak'd; While poor Juetta, out of Wits, Had like t' have fallen into Fits. The Dogs, with Madness, tear about, Increase the Clamour and the Rout: The Uproar louder, brought, at last, Hubert and Hilda down, in Haste: Galfred, the first requiring Aid, His Collar burst, they back his Head, His Bosom bareâ'till, by Degrees, The ready Lambative gives Ease: Juetta, next, their Cares demand, By Helps, judiciously, at Hand; The Cordials brought were soon apply'd, Or else Juetta, sure, had dy'd: But now, the Fright and Terror over, Her Spirits, soon again, recover, And, as their Forces grow more strong, Add Spring and Vigour to her Tongue: What, first, her Passion most increas'd, Was Virtue wrong'dâby filthy Beast. Murdac was call'd a stupid Lout, For letting Pompey go about; Hilda could hardly 'scape her Clutches, For not securing little Duchess; And Galfred too, among the rest, Was blam'd, for laughing at the Jest. Hubert alone, from female Blindness, Escap'd her Tongue, and shar'd her Kindness. At length, none making a Reply, Her Anger lessen'd.âBy and by The Room was mopp'd, the Scene was chang'd, And ev'ry thing in Order rang'd; Fresh Coffee made.âThey found their Speech,â And Clara stroak'd the little Bitch: Good Humour, thus, return'd again, (That sweetest Charm in Grief or Pain) And Galfred's with Juetta's chime, Who in Backgammon pass the Time. Hilda, meanwhile, had not forgot The dire Contrivance of her Plot. The Clock erect, by Galfred's Side, For fifty Years had never lied; Wound up by his observant Care, (A Present to the future Heir) Had, with delib'rate Strokes, pronounc'd The Hour of Sixâthe Time denounc'd; When missing Hubertâgone beforeâ She pass'd, on Tiptoe, thro' the Door, And, slily, tripping on with Speed, Soon reach'd the destin'd Place agreed. The Sun was set, the Air was bright, The purple Clouds were streak'd with Light; While in the West, with pallid Grace, The Silver Moon displays her Face; Serenely calm, the Winds, till now, With whisp'ring Breezes silent blow. Butâlike Vicissitudes of Life, Now balmy Peace, now Noise and Strifeâ The rustling Leaves are fan'd around; The Swallows swiftly skim the Ground; And spreading Clouds, that threat'ning low'r, Portend a quick-approaching Show'r. Hubert, who ready, there, before, Expected Hilda, near the Door Within his Arms receiv'd the Maid, And Thanks, in eager Kisses, paid. âHaste, Hubert, cries the treach'rous Quean, âThe Rain comes on, and we are seen; Then, op'ning straight, with thrusting Knee, She push'd him in, and turn'd the Key. Rejoic'd at Heart, away she hied, While Hubert âHilda, Hilda!â cry'd, And thunder'd with repeated Might, While, hallowing loud, she bidââGood Night;â Holding her Sides, with Laughing pain'd, And scamper'd fast, becauseâit rain'd. Return'd;âwithin the Porch she rests, To shake her Cloaths, and wipe her Breasts: Where, for a While, she strains her Wit For some Invention of Deceit; But soon contriv'd a Lie, to cover The Absence of her limbo'd Lover: When meeting Berno, come from Ditching, She went with himâinto the Kitchen. Here Galfred's Labour'rs all were met, To rest their Limbs, and wipe their Sweat: A boist'rous Crew of rough-hewn Hinds With tawny Skins, and stupid Minds, Who, long inur'd to daily Toil, Contract the Colour of the Soil: The Wenches too, tho' better Mould, Were something masculine and bold, With coarse red Arms, and sunburnt Faces, With sheepish Looks, and awkward Graces, Well suited those, we just did mention, In Shape, in Features, and Dimension: And here too,âNature, oftâthey say, Did move, tho' in a dirty Way: Which seem'd, in Truth, to be most likely, As Eustace look'd at Maudâobliquely, And had not Hilda, then, been there, Might steal his HandsâI know not where: Thus while some drinking, some a smoaking, And others with Horse-laugh a joking, Murdac, who just was come from Fair, And sitting, great, in Elbow Chair, With Can on Knee of homebrew'd Drink, To Hilda, grinning tipt the Wink, On her Approach, with chimsy Jest, He slipt a Topknot in her Breast; Which Rose perceiv'dâthat little Baggage Who fed the Magpie in the Passage, And, whisp'ring, told about the Place How slily Hilda tapt his Face. But not, of trifling Things, to chatter, As Authors doâto make up Matter, Leave we the rustick Churls a gnawing, And Luncheons, spread with Rashers, pawing; For Hilda, call'd by Clara, left 'em, And of her Company bereft 'em. The Clock went Seven:âJuetta thought It Time for Supper to be brought: And as a little will suffice For Lady's Stomach, that is nice, She order'd, quickly, be prepar'd The Larks that Hubert had ensnar'd; And (as for his Digestion best) To get her Husband's Sagos drest But wonder'd Hubert did not come To lay the Cloth, and clear the Room; When Hilda, ready at a Lie, With Confidence soon made Reply, That Hubert, much with Pain opprest, Desir'd Excuse, to take his Rest: Juetta who, as said, from Blindness, For Hubert had a Sneaking Kindness, Strait bid her from her Closet bring The Cordial Balls of Doctor King, And twenty Grains, in Sack, so give him; Which, on her Word; would soon relieve him. Hilda, who never miss'd t'improve, By any Hint, the Cause of Love, With ready Steps her Will obeys, And took, with Speed, the Bunch of Keys, Well pleas'd with this invented Flam, And treated Murdac with a Dram. The Night advanc'd, the Wind grew high, And black'ning Clouds obscur'd the Sky; Impetuous Gusts their Bodies rend, And Deluges of Rain descend. The Shutters shut, and Doors secur'd, They bless their Safety, thus ensur'd; And, snug within, lament the Fate Of Travellers expos'd so late. Now, from the Wicket, next the Yard, A sudden rapping Noise is heard, Which all the House, at once, surprises; Old Galfred starts, Juetta rises: The Lanthorn lighted, sally out The stoutest of the Peasant Rout, But all abreast, and much aghast, For fear the Devilâtake the last, And op'ning Wicket, found, at Gate, Poor Oswald, sous'd like drowned Rat; Who said, and look'd most sore affrighted, That, on the Road, by Chance benighted, As 'bout the Garden Wall, around He pass'd, in coming from the Pound, Such Shrieks and Noises he did hear, As if the Devil himself were there; That, after, meeting on the Way With Baldwin with a Load of Hay, He told him, too, with great Surprise, He'd seen a Bear, with Sawcer eyes, Just by the Summer Houses's Door, Who lash'd his Tailâwith hideous Roar; Then disappear'd, as Tom could tell, And left a most sulphureous Smell. How often Men are on the Brink Of Terrors, while they little think! And where's the Hero, in the Night So bold, as nothing will affright; Or would not choose to be so civil To run awayâbefore the Devil? In Oswald's Case had CÃ¦sar been, He might, perhaps, the same have seen. The strange Account, to Galfred told, Made poor Juetta's Blood run cold; And little Clara, dead with Fear, Crept close to Galfred's Easy Chair; While Hilda, who no Tittle miss'd, Aside did laugh, almost b?p?ss'd. Now, true it was, tho' Stories doubled, That Galfred Hall had long been troubled: And some there were who freely talk'd That, even Galfred's Father walk'd, With grisly Beard, and Visage gruff, With Truncheon arm'd, and plaited Ruff: In Dead of Night, was seen to come In what they call'dâthe haunted Room: And all the Servants, young and old, Had, often, thro' the Hundred told, That Noises strange were nightly heard, With which their very Wits were scar'd, Like bandy'd Tables, Beds, and Chairs; And Chains, as dragging down the Stairs: That, even now, they're so much daunted, They dare not pass the Room was haunted. No Wonder then, what Oswald said Should make them all so much afraid: And so it wasâthat drawing nigher, And cov'ring close the ember'd Fire, Their whole Discourse did turn on Visions, Of Spectres, Ghosts, and Apparitions. Murdac and Hilda, by Permission, On this Occasion had Admission; While all, attentive, sate to hear Of Stories told, that made them store; For Galfred, oldest of the five, Knew more than any Man alive, And, by implicit Faith assisted, An Hour talk'd, and ne'er desisted, Of Witches, Wizards, Elves, and Fairies, That plagu'd Mankind with strange Vagaries: Of Will o' the Wisps, that often lighted, To Ruin, Travellers benighted; Of Goblins, Talismans, and Dreams, Enchanted Castles, Woods, and Streams; Of whate'er had, or had not been, And what he swore himself had seen; While gaping, with Attention strong, They watch'd the Motions of his Tongue, 'Till now, almost with Terror dead, They, none, did care to go to Bed. But Galfred's Hour of Rest approach'd, Which no Concern had e'er encroach'd, And therefore to his Chamber past, While pretty Clara held him fast: The Bed was warm'd, the Pillows laid To raise the higher Galfred's Head; The Spitting-pot was plac'd, well rinsed, And by his Side a Jug of Linseed; As, by Juetta's Arm, a Cup Of Cordial, if requir'd, to sup. Hilda, in Hurry, help'd the faster Undress her Mistress and her Master, When poor Juetta laid her down To snore, with Impotence, on Down. Both fast tuck'd up, as well as able, And Rushlight plac'd upon the Table, Hilda and Clara then took Leave, Clara still holding by her Sleeve, And to her Chamber, strait, repairs, Which lay another Pair of Stairs, Where into Bed they quickly crept, And in each other's Arms they slept. Now, Floods of Rain in Cat'racts pours, And louder still the Tempest roars; Dread Thunder rolls; and Light'ning flies, With forked Death, along the Skies; And echoing Peals, at Distance, sound, With glaring Horror, all around; To which succeeds, with horrid Din, A furious rumbling Noise within, As Hell itself, in Rage, broke loose, Had ta'en Possession of the House, And all the Fiends, in Battle wag'd With dire Attack, had just engag'd; The Pewter from the Shelves was thrown, And Pots and Kettles tumbled down; Terror and Dread increas'd throughout, The Rush burnt blue, and strait went out: Juetta trembling lay, and wet; And Galfred 'tween the Bankets sweat: So great their Fear, alike they strove, By lying close, to shew their Love, Tho now indeed, they little thought Of Pleasuresâmore than Safety brought. Here, to account for this great Evil, 'Twas Nature's Self that rais'd the Devil: For, as we hinted just above, Eustace and Maud were hot in Love; Which she, with equal Wildfire burn'd, As kindly answer'd and return'd, And so, by mutual Inclination, Agreed to quench byâT?t?ll?t??n Now, as ingenious Love's Invention Is quick;âto favour his Intention, By odd Contrivance, Maud, G?d bless her, Was mounted, cover'd, on the Dresser, Where, in the Height of boist'rous Motion, Ensu'd this dreadful, rude Commotion; For, with her Legs, she overthrew The Pewter, Brass, and Pipkins too: The Dishes roll'd the L??d knows whither, And down they tumbled, both, together: Undaunted, yet, upon the Floor They finish'd thatâbegan before. Now, Nature, by its Laws impell'd, Was calmer grownâher Passion quell'd: Our loving Pair below, thought best Just where they fellâto take their Rest: Above, Juetta and her Spouse Turn'd Back to Back, as still as Mouse, And sunk in Quiet, slumb'ring lay In pleasant Dreams, till Break of Day: All calm without, serene and bright Display'd the Moon's refulgent Light. The END of the FIRST CANTO. THE SECOND CANTO. THE ARGUMENT TO THE SECOND CANTO. Day-break (1). A Reflection (17). Account of the Employments of Galfred's Labourers in Farming (33). The Sun being risen, Hilda, recollecting the leaving Hubert in the Summer House, rises, and hastens thither to let him out (49). Description of the Morning (67). Finds the Door open, and Hubert gone (74). Account of Hubert's Deliverance, and his Adventures in the Night (91); in the Barn with Lucy (117). Hilda returning frighted, meets with Hubert by the Moat (151); tells him the Excuse she had made, for his Absence, to Juetta. They repair to their several Apartments before the rest are up. All rise, and breakfast (199). Farther Description of the Farm Yard (223). The Morning hot. Galfred walks out alone to see his Labourers (269). Juetta desires Hubert's Arm to walk in the Garden (273). Farther Description of the Garden (281). Sitting together there, Juetta opens her Mind to Hubert (297), but is interrupted by Hodge coming to mow the Grass (347). Returns to the Parlour, much discomposed. Reflection (359). Murdac, Hilda, and Clara, walk to Lewisham Fair (373): Description of their Walk, and the Fair (383). They leave Clara at her Aunt's, and return. Murdac, much in Liquor, on the Way, drags Hilda into a lonely Hovel; importunes her to a Compliance with his Desires; and promises Marriage afterwards (431). To satisfy him, she appoints him at Five that Evening; which he mistakes for Five in the Morning (449). Hubert accidentally being there, under Covert, overhears all (489). Murdac and Hilda depart, taking several Ways. Hubert watches them. Hilda gets home; is careful about her Mistress, and gets her Dinner (511). Description of Mid-day (533). Murdac reeling on, staggers at a Hayrick, and falls asleep till near Five, mistaking the Time of Assignation (543); is waked by the Braying of an Ass; goes to the Orchard; puts off his Clothes, and clambers a Beech to lop off an Arm. Hubert watching about, mindful of the Appointment Hilda had made with Murdac, steals his Cloaths, and runs to her Room (561). By Chance Juetta being in her Closet, that was contiguous, overhears them, and Hilda's Appointment to Hubert to meet her in her Apartment again at Five the next Morning (581). Juetta, greatly disordered, runs down, and, appearing violently ill, orders Hilda to go forthwith to Dartford for Dr. King the Physician; whence, she knew, she could not return till next Day Noon (623). The Mare is got ready, and Hilda and Baldwin set out (639). Description of a fine Evening (667). Juetta, pretending to be indisposed, proposes to lie in Hilda's Room; to keep Rose with her;âand ordering Maud to sit up with Galfredâthey go to Bed (681). The Morning's Dawn, the Weather clear'd, With rosy Streaks of Light appear'd: The op'ning Clouds, that slowly creep, Admit the radiant Sun to peep, Whence ev'ry Object Colour takes, And universal Nature wakes, But faintly mark'd, in Vapours veil'd, The Mist of Nightâyet unexhal'd. From Beds of Flock, with swoll'n Eyes, The yawning Clowns begin to rise; With blubber'd Looks, and matted Hair, For sev'ral Labours now prepare; Most roughly clad in Jerkins worn Of Frize, by Age and Briars torn; With shrugging, lazy Steps proceed To do the destin'd Works agreed. Happy Machines, devoid of Thought, From whence our greatest Ills are wrought, Which Apprehension mostly brings, That Curse of Beggars, as of Kings; For Kings are Beggarsâwhen in Fear, And Beggars Kingsâwhen free from Care: But here, well satisfy'd, we find Content enthron'd in ev'ry Mind: Enur'd to Labour, Cold, and Heat, Their Round of Life they still repeat: No Passions stir their grov'ling Minds, Nor Pain disturbs, nor Project blinds: With Health and Quiet bless'd, they know The best Enjoyments here below, And Maud in Eustace' Eye, is seen As fair, as was the Cyprian Queen. Murdac, with ready Fork in Hand, Directs the Bus'ness of the Land: The Horses, from the Stable drawn, Are yok'd to Plough at early Dawn, Which Eustace leads to Common-field, And Tom, behind, the Ploughshare held: Baldwin conducts the Cart, with Prong, In Prince's Close, to spread the Dung: Oswald, with Bill in Hand, proceeds To mend the Hedge in Cowslip Meads; And Berno's sent the Tares to get, While Hodge remains to thresh the Wheat: The rest, to plant, to sow, or barrow, To dig with Spade, or wheel with Barrow, To lop the Trees, or mend the Road, While Tibald tends the Sheep abroad. Now, Phoebus rose, began to clamber, To shew his Face in Hilda's Chamber, And, had he been in human Shape, Might kiss, and she forgive the Rape; For, not like Daphne, would she quarrel To hazard being chang'd to Laurel, But more compliant, had bestow'd Her kindest Favours on the God: But wak'd, with frighted Dreams opprest, She, starting, roseâand, quickly, drest; For recollecting Hubert's Case, Her Heart relented now apace, And, more, to tempt him to be Friends, Resolv'd to make him full Amends: When leaving Clara 'sleep in Bed, She trudges down with softest Tread, And stealing forth the Porch with Care, With Freedom breathes the Morning Air. The tow'ring Lark began his Song As Hilda tript it fast along; Beneath, with spangled Drops of Dew That brilliant shone, the Herbage grew, The tender Blossoms, fragrant sweet, By Warmth reviv'd, the Senses greet; And chirping Birds, on ev'ry Bough, The Force of Nature's Dictates shew; With joyous Flight, and wanton Sport. By Love inspir'd, each other court, And jointly help, by Instinct press'd, To build, with Moss, the little Nest. Hilda, the Mischief to repair, For fear the Jest had gone too far, With great Impatience mends her Pace, And, wing'd with Speed, soon reach'd the Place: Advancing, first, with tim'rous Steps, Upon the Door she, gently, taps, But finding nothing answerâcalls: With Blows redoubled, Hubert, bawls: Still no Reply.âApplies the Key, And pushing forward, with her Knee, Bolts inâand struck with Panick Fear, She look'dâbut found no Hubert there. Now, 'tis but regular, we venture, To speak of Hubert's odd Adventure, Who, when he found the wicked Jade This crafty, slip'ry Trick had play'd, And pent him, thus, like Bird in Cage, He beat, and bang'd, and storm'd with Rage: Which, magnify'd in Oswald's Ear, Produc'd the Shrieksâand Baldwin's Bear. But when, at last, he found 'twas vain, To make a Clamour, or complain, It came into his Thoughtsâto try To burst the Door, or make it fly: And groping down, by Chance, he found Some Garden Tools upon the Ground, And with a Hammer's furious Knock, He wrench'd the Staple from the Lock: Forth issu'd, thenâhe shut the Door, And left it closeâas 'twas before. The Storm and driving Rain that beat, Advis'd, for Shelter, some Retreat; And passing by, the shortest Way, Where, by the Moat, the Rook'ry lay, A Barn there stood, by Time decay'd, Wherein a gaping Breach was made, Part hid with Weeds, and Nettles rank, That, choaking, grew upon the Bank. Here, Hubert, ent'ring, thought it best, 'Till Tempest, ceast, awhile to rest: But, to his great Surprise, he found The Gipsy, Lucy, there, half drown'd, Who, just returning from the Fair, Did there, for Shelter, too, repair: Hubert, who was a mettled Fellow, And Lucy, friskly, ripe, and mellow, Well pleas'd to find so good a Station, And loth to lose a fair Occasion, Agreed to pass the Night together, Securely snug from blust'ring Weather, And ten Foot high, upon the Hay, In Dalliance pass'd their Time away: 'Twere hard, to cast Reflection on her, Since none presum'd to touch her Honour; But, Opportunity and Season, As known full well, will banish Reason, And therefore choose not, here, to wrong, Good Hubert's Strength, with sland'rous Tongue, For Men must know, in such a Place, What they would do in such a Case, And Women too, how weak the Fence Against the tempting Lure of Sense. The Bed so sweet, we may surmise, They knew not, either, how to rise, But, as the Morning Light might prove Too glaring, for the Seat of Love, Lucy no longer would refrain To set her Cloaths to Rights again; And, since the Bus'ness of the Day Would not admit too much of Play, Well satisfy'd with this Beginning, She parting, buss'd, and went a Spinning. Return we now, as fit, again To speak of Hilda's Fright and Pain, For, first, she thought some dev'lish Spell Had carry'd Hubert down to Hell, And thus, in Whirlwind borne away By Beelzebub, his Scores to pay, And therefore thought, though hard to swallow, That she in Justice, too, might follow; On which Account, with dreadful Fear She bent her Stepsâshe knew not where, 'Till passing by the Barnâin Sadness, Biting her Thumbsâin very Madness, Saw, looking forwards, t'wards the Moat, Hubert, a butt'ning up his Coat, And running to him,âyet, in Fear, Cried,ââOh! how glad I am you're here, âFor much I fear'd some dreadful Evil âHad been your Lot, from Man or Devil; âFor when, last Night, thro' all the Rain, âI went to let you out again, âAnd found you gone,âand all the Night âNo Tidingsâto relieve my Fright, âNo Thought can reach, or Tongue impart âMy Grief of Mind, or Pain of Heart: âForgive me, Hubert, this Excursion, âIntended only for Diversion, âAnd as you knowâfor our Repose, â'Tis best to keep our Secrets close: âMy Mistress thinks you're now reposing, âAnd with the Doctor's Powder dozing, âWhich, for your Illnessâmy Invention, âShe order'd youâin kind Intention. Hubert, who, in his Mind, projected To be reveng'dâwhen least suspected, Well knowing that Dissimulation Is greatest Friend to Inclination; Approving bestâhis Thoughts to bide, With ravisht Kissesâthus replied: âMy fairest Hilda, much I owe âFor Kindness your Expressions shew, âAnd, far from Anger, well approve âThese little Sallies of your Love; â'Tis all forgot:âLet's hasten home, âYou, to your ChamberâI, my Room.â This said, they parted, Arm in Arm, Free from Suspicion, or Alarm, And, up the Staircase, soon, recover'd Each their Apartmentâundiscover'd. The Clock struck Six:âAnd Clara, dress'd, Her Joy, in ev'ry Look express'd; For Murdac promis'd she should go To Day, with Hilda, see a Shew: In Jumps of Gladness she prepares, And trips, with Hilda, down the Stairs. Old Galfred cough'd; Juetta spake; For both, some Time, had been awake; When enter'd, Clara ran in Haste, And both, with fond Caress, embrac'd: The Shirt, and Flannel Waistcoat air'd, And Galfred's Vigour now repair'd, From Bed arisingâHilda reaches, With titt'ring Smiles, his Buckskin Breeches, Which Galfred, slily bent, receives, And pats her Bosom, as it heaves: Equipt, and Woollen Cap put on, With careful Tread, he hobbles down, While poor Juetta, indispos'd With grievous Headach, longer doz'd, And charging Hilda's special Care Her Master's Breakfast to prepare, Directed, none with Noise presume To break her Restâbut leave the Room. Now, brighter grows diffusive Light, And ev'ry Object chears the Sight, The darting Rays with Splendour warm, And humming Bees begin to swarm. Without, the lowing Cows do wait With strutting Udders, at the Gate, Which op'ning, Blanche as kindly treats, And claps their Sides, and stroaks their Teats. The Hogs, with snorting Gladness, greet The straddling Wench that brings them Meat. And Cicely calls the Poultry round, And spreads the Barley on the Ground, Which thievish Sparrows, from the Thatch, With chirping Impudence, do catch. Maud in the Kitchen, Brush in Hands, Performs the Work the House demands, And having gratify'd her Wishes, Had set to rights her Pans and Dishes; While Lucy, wriggling of her Heel, Demurely sits at Spinning Wheel. Juetta's Headach much amended, Which on Indulgence most depended, She rose; but, dizzy in her Head, Could scarce go down, by Hilda led; But Breakfast brought, and all in Order, It lessen'd, greatly, her Disorder, And, tho' a little sick at Heart, Sipp'd off, of Chocolate, a Quart: While Galfred, better judging, fed On good Milk Porridge stuff'd with Bread, And thus made up, as well as might, The Perspiration of the Night. Hubert descending, as from Bed, With Nightcap yet upon his Head, With great Respect, and good Behaviour, Return'd his Thanks for Lady's Favour; While she, by Tokens plain, discover'd Her Joy; to find him well recover'd; Extolling, as the finest Thing, The Cordial Balls of Doctor King. Murdac with Sunday's Coatâfull long, New Hat, and Wigâin Buckle strong, And Hilda, trim, and neat, and fair, In Hat of Straw, with Country Air, Now with the pretty Clara walk'd, To see the Fairâof which they talk'd. Mean While, good Galfred, all alone, Went out, to see what Work was done, And with his honest Bluntness, fam'd, Encourag'd some, and others blam'd. Hubert was taking Leave to go, As having something else to do: But, at Juetta's Suit, he stay'd, And to her Will Observance paid: When, leaning on his Arm, at Length, With feeble Voice, and little Strength, She will'd him to the Garden go, To breathe the Air, an Hourâor so. The Sun was hot, and, as 'twas meet, Requir'd some shady, cool Retreat; And soon they found a small Alcove, Obscurely plac'd within the Grove, Of antique Form, with Lattice drest, As made for Time himself to rest; Above their Heads, the awful Shade An ample Canopy had made, And all around the Jasmine twin'd, With Woodbine's fragrant Sweets combin'd: The cawing Rooks, with circling Flight, In undisturb'd Repose delight: Along the Walk the Blackbird flew, To court his Mate beneath the Eugh; And warbling Birds, in wildest Notes, Securely stretch'd their little Throats. Here Hubert and Juetta sate In free Society, and Chatt, When ush'ring in, by plain Advances, With simp'ring Looks, and am'rous Glances, âHubert,â says she, âI much approve âYour faithful Service, and your Love: âI freely own, that Galfred's Years âDeceive my Hopes, and raise my Fears; âFor, daily, more and more I find, âHow weak his Body and his Mind, âAnd, to my Sorrow, often prove âThe feeble Efforts of his Love: âThus, all my Pains can hardly raise âA Hope, to lengthen long his Days. âBut, should most unrelenting Fate âLeave me in wretched Widow's State, âOn you, alone, I can depend, âBy active Warmth, to be my Friend: âMean Time, you know the hard Restraint âOn Woman waits, in all we want; âFor, so censorious is the Time, âWe scarce can lookâwithout a Crime: âAnd as the busy Eye will watch, âAnd ev'ry harmless Motion catch, âOur Impulse, best 'tis to withstand,â (With this she, gently, squeez'd his Hand) âAnd carefully avoid Reflection, âIn finding Places from Inspection: âThese Reasons, Hubert, made me to choose âThis fair Occasion not to lose, âWhere, under Covert, one may find âThe Pow'r to actâor speak one's Mind.â With this, she cast a wishful Look, That with expressive Ardour spoke. But Hubert, tho' of Flesh and Blood, The tempting Lure, with Pain, withstood: For being honestâin Intention, (Eluding wiselyâby Prevention) Unwilling, yet, to understand, With humble Mien withdrew his Hand, And thus reply'd:ââHow shall I find âThe Words, to speak my grateful Mind: âBelieve me, Madam, Time nor Fate âWill ever other Thoughts create, âMy Master's Goodness such, that all âMy Services will be too small: âBut, should inexorable Death âDeprive him of his precious Breath, âTo you belongs the warmest Zeal âThat Tongue can speak, or Heart can feel.â Scarce had he spoke, but who should pass, But Hodge, with Sycthe, to mow the Grass; When rising, with distracted Air Of Disappointment, Rage, and Fear, She hobbled back, almost in Swoon, And on the Couchâshe laid her down. Galfred return'd, was on the Border Of Death, to see his Chuck's Disorder. With quiv'ring Hand held up her Head, Most weighty grownâthe Senses fled: But Hartshorn, by its usual Merits, In some Degree recall'd her Spirits. As Grief and Joy alternate sway The Soul that actuates human Clay, So, in this History, we read That unforeseen Events succeed To give Vexation, Grief, or Pain, And then, Delight and Joy, again: For tho' the Wretch's Lot appears Severe and hard, for Length of Years, The Scene will surely change at last, And Joy compensate Sorrows past: Thus, turning round like Fortune's Wheel, An Interval of Mirth will steal. But, not to dwell on Scenes of Care, Let's take a Trip to Lew'sham Fair. The Walking dry, and charming Weather, With Hearts as light as any Feather, Murdac, with Hilda, round the Waist, Pursu'd the Path with eager Haste, While little Clara, wild and gay, Pick'd up the Daisies by the Way; Thro' Meadows, Woods, and Fields they pass, O'er clotted Glebe, and Stiles, and Grass; And pushing forwards, very soon They enter'd, gazing, Lew'sham Town. Here, Clara was as full of Prattle, As was the Place of Noise and Rattle, For, what with thrusting, fiddling, squeaking, There was no bearing well, or speaking; But when the Andrewâsounding Trumpet, Was follow'd by Queen DidoâStrumpet, Her little Hands erect, and Eyes, Betray'd her Pleasure and Surprise: Here, coz'ning Chapmen, under Shed, With Canvass strain'd, or Sailcloth spread, Retail their Tinsel Toys, and Laces, To fing'ring Clowns with wond'ring Faces; There, Lads and Lasses,âkissing, laughing, And Jolly Farmers,âjoking, quaffing, While standing some, and some on Benches, Are fondly huggingâsqueaking Wenches: Some, crowding, press to see the Shew, And others saunter, to and fro, To purchase Gingerbread, and Toys, To munch themselves, or please their Boys, Who scamp'ring run, as if for Life, When Punch is beating of his Wife. Now rattling Drum proclaims, the Wonder Of all the World, is standing yonder, Where, on the painted Cloth, appear The Lion, Porcupine, and Bear. Some, thronging, gape to see the Prank Of Andrew with the Mountebank, Who, round the Stage in Velvet struts, To gripe their Pocketsâand their Guts; While others, stretch'd on Tiptoe, stand To see the Feats of Slight of Hand, Or on the Rope, to view the Jade Expose her Legsâfor gainful Trade. But were we, now, to search the Houses, And tell the Tricks with Girls and Spouses, The Gambols, Merriment and Jesting, The Effects of Liquor, Sport and Feasting, In ev'ry Corner, ev'ry Shed, Or on the Stools, or on the Bed; 'Twou'd raise a Glow, perhaps might cause Too strong a Bent to Nature's Laws; Enough it is for me, to tell, That Murdac treated Hilda well; And having furnish'd all their Wants, And Clara left to stay at Aunt's; He now return'd, in tipsy Mood, As Hilda too, had warm'd her Blood. Thus, loving clasp'd, as on the Way, There stood a Hovel, made of Clay With Bavins mix'd, obscure and low, To shelter Cows in Frost and Snow; Murdac, with boist'rous Start of Love, By Force compell'd her, there, to move, Where, under Covert, stagg'ring down, He spokeâand dragging of her Gown, With stamm'ring Utt'rance, surest Sign Of raging Lust, as well as Wine; âMy Dearâdoâdo butâdo but grant âThe Pleasures now, you know, I want, âAnd you shall be my Wife I vow, âBut let me do itâdo itânow: âIn Country Way, it is no Lie, âWe always prove, before we buy; âAndâ [swearing] âif you'll give me Ease, âYou shall be marry'd, when you please.â Hilda, in Danger, now, of Might, No Doubt had been in dreadful Fright, But that the Promise made of Marriage Did chasen Fear, and soften Carriage; And judg'd, for ought that she cou'd tell, A Contract's best, with Nature's Seal: Besides, as being Country-bred, Their Ways ran always in her Head: She yielded to his bold Request, But thought, another Place was best; When holding fast her Coats, to guard, And struggling, his Efforts to ward; âHold Murdac, holdâ (says she) âmy Dear, âBe modestâand awhile forbear; âWe're here expos'd, and may be seen âBy some of Galfred's tattling Men, âAnd with most horrid Shame be routed: âI wou'd not have my Virtue doubted: âBe quiet, let my Cloaths alone:â (With that, she strove to keep them down) âBut as your Love I really prize âAbove my Honour, or my Eyes, âAnd as I know, your Promise giv'n, âIs good as any under Heav'n; âSuppress, at present, your Desires, âWhich Decency, you know, requires; âAnd, if at Hour of Five you'll come, âAnd softly steal into my Room, âI'll keep the Window-shutters to, âThat none may seeâwhat 'tis we do; âBut as my Lady's Closet joins, âWhere she preserves her Drams and Wines, âBe sure be silentâwhich accords, âBetter, with what we doâthan Words; âAt present, let us both begone, âAnd you'll be better, after Noon.â Murdac contented, then arose, Wiping the Dirt from off his Cloaths. And, held by Hilda, reeling on, They homewards went, but parted soon. 'Tis strange, what Accidents arrive, As if the Devil did contrive: But often, well-concerted Schemes Abortive prove, like idle Dreams; And so it was. To solve the Riddle, The Place was parted in the Middle; And Hubert, whom the sultry Heat Had much fatigu'd with Toil and Sweat, Was in the farthest Part unseen Asleep, when Murdac enter'd in; But waking, with the boist'rous Noise, And knowing well his croaking Voice, He kept him close, by Fortune plac'd, And saw, and heard, whatever pass'd: Inflam'd with Thoughts that Chance inspir'd, And with Designs projected, fir'd, By what Device, might be repaid The Trick, that Hilda lately play'd; As soon as gone, he sallied out, And ventur'd Home, tho' round-about, Resolv'd to watch their Waters well, And act according as befel. Hilda return'd, as was requir'd, Her Head employ'd, tho' Body tir'd,â Repair'd to know Juetta's Pleasure, To be hereafter more at Leisure; Whom finding in weak Posture sate, And Symptoms of Hysterick State, With frighted Looks and decent Hurry, She shew'd her great Concern and Flurry; Well skim'd the Chicken Broth with Speed, As nothing else so well agreed, Which cook'd with Care and cleanly done, Procur'd her Quiet, and her own: Soon after, Dinner was prepar'd, Which only she and Galfred shar'd; But as their Stomachs both were nice, And wanted something in a Trice, The Food they judg'd wou'd best abide, Were Petit-toes and Lamb-stones fry'd, Which, having heartily divided, Juetta's Vapours then subsided; And both, with heavy Slumbers press'd, In Elbow Chairs soon fell to rest. Now, downward dart the hottest Rays, To dim the Sight with glaring Blaze; With Wasps, the madded Beasts are stung, And buzzing Flies, surround the Dung; In shady Barns and Corners sate, The loit'ring Hinds their Morsels eat, And some, extended on the Floor At their full Length, profoundly snore; While in the Pond the Herd abides, And lash their Tails to cool their Hides. Murdac with stagg'ring Steps proceeds, Where Chance directs, or Vapour leads, Till stumbling by a Rick of Hay, He headlong pitch'd, and rolling lay; Here full three Hours, in Sleep profound, His lumpish Senses had been drown'd; 'Till, near the Time appointed, rousing, By Asses Brayâthat there were browsing, He recollectedâby the Warning, But thought it wasâfor Five at Morning; For, being, then, exceeding fuddled, And, now, his Brain by Vision muddled, It turn'd him topsiturvy quite, And made him take the Wrong for Right: So, sitting up, upon his Breech, And yawning with extended Stretch, He got upon his Legs, and went About his Bus'ness, well content. Soon after, Hubert, who, as said, Some Scheme, to circumvent, had laid, Was, slily, looking all about, To watch the Motions of the Lout: At last, within the Orchard, found His Cloaths, a lying on the Ground; For Murdac, on a Beech, hard by, Was lopping off an Arm, on high; And, while intent upon his Blows, Hubert convey'd away his Cloaths: Away he stole, with watchful Eye, Quite unobserv'd by any Spy, And to his Chamber quickly hies To leave his ownâfor this Disguise, Which, as with Metal trimm'd, would stand The curious Search of Hilda's Hand: With slutt'ring Joy, the Time now come, He, softly, enters Hilda's Room, Where, well prepar'd, with Darkness spread, She lay, expectingâon the Bed. As Fortune oft, that wicked Hussy, Delights to be with Lovers busy, By Chance Juetta came to visit, Just then, her dear Retreat, the Closet: The cunning Hilda, to be sure From all Suspicion, and secure, Had ask'd her Leave, to see a Neighbour, Who sent t' invite her to her Labour: Juetta who, from sad Reflection, Then labour'd under great Dejection, While Galfred slept, was, now, come up To take one cordial, chearing Cup, But hearing, suddenly, a Rust'ling In Hilda's Room, and something bustling, She, to a Crevice bending Ear, With strange Surprise, these Words did hear: âNow, Hilda, you are fairly bit, âFor what I suffer'dâby Deceit: âThat roguish Trick!âI yet approve, âAll Stratagems are fair in Love: âBut, if you would not be defeated, âThis Interview must be repeated; âAnd Murdac may, in Peace, provide âTo make youâhis elected Bride.â Hilda was struck with great Surprise, But yet, with Laughter, thus replies: âYou Villain! how could you pretend âBy Plots, like these, to make a Friend? âAnd yet, I cannot help forgive âThe pleasant Way that you deceive: âBut, dearest Hubert, I depend âUpon your Honourâto the End. âTo speak the Truthâas much inclin'd, âI always lov'd youâin my Mind; âAnd as a Proof of my Regard, âAs wellâyour Silence to reward, âCome hither in the Morn at Five, âYou'll find me here, if I'm alive.â This said, with grateful Thanks, her Due, He, gently, from her Arms withdrew, And, softly treading, reach'd the Door, When Silence reign'd, as did before. To keep Juetta's Spirits up, She could not helpâthe other Sup: But, notwithstanding Cordials ready, A certain Furor seiz'd the Lady, When, down she went, as in Despair, And slung her Selfâin Easy Chair; âThe Doctorâ cries!âgo!âquickly!âfly! Or else, I certainly shall die. The Bell was rung, and Hilda came To help support the struggling Dame. Poor Galfred look'd like any Ghost, For fear his Deary should be lost. At length, her Fits decreasing, brought The Use of Speech, and settled Thought; When strait she will'd, that Hilda bring From Dartford, hither, Doctor K???. Hilda, who lov'd her Mistress well, Was greatly shock'd at what befel, And as Disinterest discovers A true Concern, forgot her Lovers: Besides, the Journey much delighting. As were her Lady's Fits affrighting, Prepar'd, with Pleasure, to obey, Nor, longer wasted Time of Day: Baldwin was bid from Grass to get The dappled Pad, with Pillion fit; And Hilda, as the Case requir'd, In Riding Suit was soon attir'd. The Palfrey brought, with heavy Straddle Baldwin was mounted in the Saddle; And Tom (for Hubert was not there) Help'd Hilda up, with modest Care: But still, there was some little Trouble, The Mare, not us'd to carry double, Would kick behind, by Starts and Fits; Yet Hilda, still, with Courage sits, And fast to Baldwin clinging, reaches For Pommel, round his Leathern Breeches: But gentle now, and she well plac'd, Tom holds the Gateâand out they pac'd. Thus well dispatch'd: Juetta sate, With heavy sighs, in mournful State: While Galfred griev'd, with watchful Eye Did all her fretful Wants supply. The wasted Day began decline: The Sun, with fainter Rays, did shine, 'Till, sinking down, with splendid Grace, Beneath the Mountain hid his Face: Sweet Philomel, upon the Spray, Most sweetly mark'd the Close of Day: The hooting Owl began to fly, With sleepy Pace, along the Sky; While leathern Bats, with dodging Flight, Do usher in the Shades of Night: Still Calm prevails: no Mist appear'd: At Distance, Village Curs were heard, The Croak of Frogs, the Clack of Mill, And, on the Road, the Grinding Wheel. Juetta, now, was something willing, To keep her little Strength, by Filling; And, as the Time was fit for picking, She order'd Maud to boil the Chicken: But peevish still, with hard Complaints, As having nothingâthat she wants, Poor Galfred vext, for thus delaying; And Maud was ratedâfor her Staying; At lengthâthe Chicken brought, and eat, A while they talk'd, awile they sate, When finding shadowy Night come on, And thinking bestâto lie alone, Because her Husband's Cough, and Jumbling Might hinder Sleep, by Noise or Fumbling, She order'd Roseâthat Fire be made In Hilda's Roomâand make the Bed; For well she knew, from Dartford, home, 'Till next Day Noon, she could not come; And, as for Galfred, judging right That one should sit with him at Night, She order'd Maud to do that Duty, The better fitâfor want of Beauty: (For Women, tho' devoutly zealous To please their Husbands, still are jealous) And with her Self propos'd to keep Rose, to prevent Relapse in Sleep. Thus order'd, up the Stairs they go, At decent Hour, in comely Row, Each one assisted, by the Aid Of each their sev'ral Waiting Maid: At Galfred's DoorâMaud took the Light, And Galfred bid his ChuckâGood Night.

The Lover's Feast, the Wretch's Balm: Whose mantling Veil does, brooding, frame The lewd Device, and cover Shame: Now, all thy gloomy Influence spreads To form Designs, and actuate Deeds: The brilliant Stars with twinkling Light, And shooting Meteors, catch the Sight: Descending Brooks o'er Pebbles creep, And, murm'ring softly, bush to Sleep. But Order bids, we first reveal, Where Hubert was, which none cou'd tell, And also Murdac's Lot to teach, We left a lopping of the Beach. Hubert, with wicked Joy, elate, At Murdac's, and his own Estate, In order to prevent Suspicion, Or what might hinderâRepetition, Now, thinking best, with Air and Grace, To shew, again, his wonted Face, From Hilda's Chamber quickly ran, Left Murdac's Cloaths, and took his own: Then at the Orchard Gate he stands, With Angle Rod and Line in Hands; Where, at the farther End he found, Murdac in's Shirt, who, gaping round, And searching every Hedge about, Was coming now, in Dudgeon, out, Resolv'd to find them, far or near, Or else to Cunning-Man to steer. Hubert with Sorrow most affected, (The better to be less suspected) Lamented much his mournful Case, Then took his Leave, and left the Place; And to the Mill directs his Way To pass in Sport the Rest of Day. Upon the Verge of Galfred's Lands A ruin'd Pile of Building stands, A Convent once, where Monks enjoy'd A Life of Ease, with Plenty cloy'd; Where pamper'd Nature, unrestrain'd, With all voluptuous Pleasures reign'd: Long since the greatest Part subverted, The rest into a Mill converted: The tott'ring Remnants still were seen Of Vaults, and Arches, that had been. Here one of Galfred's Tenants liv'd, Who by his gentle Favour thriv'd. Behind, a lofty Mountain's Brow O'erhung the mould'ring Walls below, And up the craggy Sides there stood, Of various Trees, a rising Wood; From whence there issu'd forth a Rill, With furious Stream, that drove the Mill: Thro' which its dashing Waters fed A widen'd Lake, along the Mead: Round this, thick Rows of Willows made, With Poplars mix'd, a pleasing Shade. Here Hubert, sat at Leisure, took The prickl'd Perch with Line and Hook: But wanting something where to place The Fish that flounder'd on the Grass, Proceeded to the Mill, to chuse A Basket proper for his Use; Where, bolting in with heedless Tread, (And other Thoughts, that fill'd his Head) He found the Miller and his Maid Upon a Sack of Pollard laid; Who close, in that convenient Station, Were ord'ring Thingsâby Ag?t?t??n. Quickâstarting backâhe reach'd the Pool, (For Hubert lov'd the Golden Rule) And, on a Willow Twig, he hung The Fish he tookâand mov'd along. The Ev'ning fairâhe, still, pursu'd His Sport, 'till dusky Night ensu'd, When getting homeâso long he stay'd, That all, but him, were gone to Bed: The Time, now, favour'dâto dispose Some clever Wayâof Murdac's Cloaths, When stealing out, he clamber'd high Upon a lofty Elm, hard by, Where, on the Top, like Trophies laid. These Spoils of Murdacâhe display'd: Thus, uninform'd of all that pass'd, He, softly, crept to Bedâin Haste. Now, bashful Cynthia, mend your Pace, Nor pry, so close, in ev'ry Place: And you chaste Vot'ries, cease to spy At Things, perhaps, offend your Eye. The Night advanc'dâJuetta stay'd A while, and then dismiss'd her Maid: Put out the Lightâand, wisely, chose To calm her Spiritsâby Repose: But, weakly, all Efforts withstood The Agitation of her Blood; For tumbling, all the Night, she lay With anxious Thoughts, till Break of Day. Hubert, whose Mind ran all the Night On Hilda's Promise of Delight, Before the Time, and loose array'd, Went softly in, and crept to Bed: Juetta seem'd asleep, but mov'd, With eager Warmth, to what she lov'd; Till in the Endâas Joys provoke The raptur'd Senses, Hubert spoke. Frighted, as from a Dream, she said, âBase Man! and am I thus betray'd?â She spoke no more:âFor Hubert's Dread So greatâhe started from the Bed: âIn vain it is,â she then rejoin'd, âTo cover, thus, your shameless Mind; âToo well I feelâhow ill one can âEvade the Wiles of artful Man: âWhat have I, ever, done or said, âT' encourage an Attempt so mad? âBut, as we can't recall the past. âYou need not, Hubert, make such Haste: âSince Love did this Attempt contrive, âBe you discreet:âI may forgive.â Hubert, whom no Temptation less, Could e'er engageâso far transgress, With humble Bow, and winning Grace, By soft Approachâresum'd his Place; When, giving Loose to Love, oppress'd With melting Joy, they sunk to Rest. Below, when Galfred, first, was laid By Maud, well cover'd up, in Bed; Her portly Mien, and rolling Eyes, (With Bubbies of the largest Size) Produc'd a Flame, which nought could quench But harmless Dalliance with the Wench: And Maud, whose Duty was to please, Try'd all, to give her Master Ease. That Warmth should glow in such a Frame, Or so impel the virtuous Dame, Is wond'rous strangeâ'till we relate The hidden Causeâproduc'd by Fate: But this will, fully, clear her Honour From all Reflections cast upon her; And plainly shewâfrom whence this Rage Of Loveâin Impotence and Age. The Night before, as Health requir'd A Glass of thatâshe most desir'd, Juetta, in her thoughtless Hurry, Fill'd Viper Wine instead of Clary; Of which she kindly sent, unthinking, Another Cup, for Galfred's drinking, Which so burnt up the poor old Squire, That Maud could, scarce, allay Desire. While Things were thus, in awkward Guise, Murdac to Hilda's Chamber hies, As suiting wellâher Approbation, To keep th' appointed Assignation; But bolting inâhe gap'd and star'd As all his Senses had been scar'd, And could not speak his veh'ment Distress, At finding Hubertâwith his Mistress. Concern'd no lessâfor the Disaster That might befall his worthy Master: But finding both asleep, he knew His Distance fit, and so withdrew. When passing on, as just before, The Passage led by Galfred's Door, On hearing Galfred cough, he crept, And, softly, thro' the Keyhole peep'd; But saw, what's hard to be accounted, Fat Maud upon her Master mounted. Frighted, with Wonder and Surprise, (Unable to believe his Eyes) With supple Faith, and just Decision, Conceiv'd it allâenchanted Vision: When, driving out, he turn'd his Eyes, With great Emotion and Surprise, Upon the Elmâwhere hung his Cloaths, The Terror of the neighb'ring Crows; Confirm'd in Mind, that all this Evil Was wrought by nothingâbut the Devil: Quick, clamb'ring up, with Joy recover'd The Prize, so luckily discover'd: Then went to fetchâthe Weather clearâ The little Clara from the Fair. Now, all the Mischiefs of the Night Were banish'd by the spreading Light; Hubert withdrew from Hilda's Room, And Maud return'dâto use her Broom: While Galfred and Juetta stay'd, Some longer Time, for Rest in Bed: At length, as if by joint Consent, They rose, and to the Parlour went: Galfred, poor Soul, could hardly stand, Or hold the Gruel in his Hand; And in Juetta's Looks were read, A trembling Nerve, and aching Head. The Hour struck Eight, with pleasant Chime From faithful Monitor of Time: Galfred, his Spirits to recruit, As Time and Weather both did suit, Went forth, as usual, to survey, The Meadows, where they made the Hay. The Sun shot out his hottest Beams, With scorching Heat, and sultry Gleams; Tho', oft, an intervening Cloud Did, now and then, his Glory shroud: The Brakes and Brambles, there, among The speckled Snake did glide along; The silken Webs on Boughs suspend, And Stalks of drooping Flow'rs did bend; Fatigu'd, beneath a Pollard's Shade, Good Galfred, now, his Seat had made, To see the Labours of his Field, And what Produce his Grass did yield: In busy Groups, in various Places, In light Array, with chearful Faces, The Men and Women, here and there, In diff'rent Ways their Toil did share, In waving Rows to rake the Hay, Or raise the Cocks to cart away; While others, in the Yard do stow The heavy Loads, and build the Mow. The enliv'ning Scene, and fragrant Sweet, Invited Galfred keep his Seat, 'Till Clara, led by Murdac, pass'd, And, fondly, ran to be embrac'd: Delight redoubled in her Breast At finding, there, a Partridge' Nest: Then, home she went, by Galfred led, With busy Thoughts that fill'd her Head, And with diverting, idle Prattle Of all she'd seen and heard, did tattle. Juetta, now, recover'd quite, From longing Qualms, and Toils of Night, To pass the Time, with Clara, goes, Affairs in Dairy to dispose; Sets Blanche and Lucy, both, in Turn, T'assist to ply the gurgling Churn; To press the Cheese; the Cream to skim That rises, yellow, to the Brim; To mould the Butter into Rolls, And set the Milk, again, in Bowls; Then orders Maud to mind her Work About the House, and salt the Pork: Thus, well employ'd, she walk'd about Like Housewife good, with clam'rous Rout, 'Till Hilda, just return'd, declar'd That Doctor K??? was in the Yard, On which, with most becoming Air, She went, and sate in Elbow Chair. The Doctor, with Deportment steady, And grave Advance, approach'd the Lady, And judging right, to find her ailing, (The Hopes of ready Fee prevailing) Directed Med'cines most specifick To make her healthy, and prolifick: With good Restoratives, and Physick, For Galfred's Weakness, and his Phthisick: All which Juetta well approv'd, And knew wou'd helpâwith what she lov'd: The Bus'ness over of Prescription, (Which needs not any more Description) We leave the Doctor, and the Wine To warm their Stomachsâ'till they dine. And, now, in proper Time shall venture To speak of Hilda's odd Adventure. Thro' Commons, Hamlets, Lanes, and Woods, Thro' Heaths and Forests, Streams and Floods, O'er Hill and Dale, thro' Slough and Moor, Without or Stop, or Bait at Door, Baldwin the mettl'd Palsrey switches, (Hilda still holding by his Breeches) When, in a Park, as he was gazing At Cows and Horses there a grazing, Dapple, with wanton Neigh, discover'd Her lewd Intentionâto be cover'd: When strait, a Stonehorse, from the rest Came trotting, with audacious Crest: Hilda, who thought of nothing worse Than rough Embraces of a Horse, Jump'd off, in order to escape, In such a Place, so foul a Rape: The Steed, whose Rage, by Love impell'd, Could not by Words or Blows be quell'd, With furious Passion made Attack, And sprung, at once, on Baldwin's Back, While distant, Hilda safe abides, With Laughterâholding both her Sidesâ To see the Figure Baldwin shew'd, Who, Centaur-like, triumphant rode, Unable, any Way, recover His former State, 'till all was over: While, round about, the Peasants flouted. And, with Horselaugh and Clamour, shouted: At length, reliev'd from desp'rate Plight Of Pain, Imprisonment, and Fright, Hilda, by Help of Stile, replac'd, Secure on Pillion, on they pac'd; But Night came on by this Delay, And Baldwin, too, had lost his Way. The Twilight gone, a dusky Red Above the Horizon was spread; Upon the Borders of the Lake The stalking Her'n his Stand did make, While, round, the soggy Vapours stood. And overhung the Fens and Flood: The Roads, that 'thwart each other lay, Distract their Thoughts, and urge their Stay: 'Till nowâthe Darkness of the Night At Distance shew'd a glimm'ring Light, To which they turn'dâand, padding on, Soon heard the Bells of Dartsord Town, And, ambling thro' the narrow Lane, In little Time they reach'd the Swan. Alighting here, the Hostess came And welcom'd in the tired Dame; And Baldwin, too, as well as able Dismounting, led the Pad to Stable: For Supper, Hilda order'dâget A Fowl, which Hostess help'd to eat; Who being, long, to Hilda known, Inform'd herâall that pass'd in Town, How, Isabel, the Malster's Wife, Was fond of Allan more than Life; That Alice, her pretty nutbrown Daughter, Had made a Slipâbut marry'd a'ter; That Agatha, the Parson's Sister, Was, always, pleas'd when any kiss'd her, And even some there were, that said, The Lord had had her Maidenhead; That Gaffer J?????'s Wife was known The greatest Whore in all the Town; That Yeoman G?????? in his Loft Had found his Spouse with Edwin, oft: That Doctor K???, if true as said, Had had two Bastards by his Maid. Thus, as the Tankard went about, The current Talk of allâcame out; And thus our Hostess did attest The Truthâher Belly had confess'd, For, tho' a Widow long she'd been, 'Twas almost mounted to her Chin. Hilda was vastly pleas'd, to find That all the Townâwas of her Mind, But judg'd, as Hostess D?bs?n thought, That Men were, only, in the Fault: For, if there were none to be had, There would not beâone Woman bad: Then, parting, came directly down To take a Turn about the Town, And pray'd the Doctor, that he'd call, With all Dispatch, at Galfred Hall: Which done, she thought it, now, was best, Returning home, to go to Rest, But whether by her Self, alone, So sly she wasâwas never known. The Morning's Light began to break, And all the Travellers to wake: Upon the Gall'ry, round the Court, From ev'ry Chamber they resort; And o'er the Rails, begin to call To bring the Horses from the Stall: Along the Penthouse, cooing stood The gentle Doves, in courting Mood: Bridget attends the Breakfast Meal, And Robin trims the Horse's Heel: The Wheels are greas'd, the Coach drawn out, And all is Hurry, Noise, and Rout: Baldwin well fed, in great Delight, In Bridget's Armsâhad pass'd the Night. The Reck'ning paid, and all prepar'd, Hilda, now mounted, left the Yard: And, as the Ostler help'd her up, The Hostess gave the Stirrup Cup, And, parting, homewards bent their Course, Without Mischance from Man or Horse, And jogg'd along, to bring, the faster, The Dates and Raisins for her Master. When near the Yard and Sound of Flail, Dapple rejoic'd, and cock'd her Tail; Murdac was then employ'd to fill A Sack of Wheat to grind at Mill; But seeing now his dearest Treasure, With headlong Haste forgot his Measure, And running on, with clumsy Stride, He lifted off his future Bride; When beck'ning her to follow close, As having something to disclose, Strait to the Barn, with simple Grin, He lugg'd her on, and, ent'ring in, Forth from his Leathern Budget brought A Ring, the Type of Wedlock's Knot, With Ribbons, Necklace, Gloves, and Garters, And candy'd Orange cut in Quarters; Which Hilda cou'd not but approve, As Tokens strong of plighted Love. But after many a towsling Hug, (The Place so secret, and so snug) He told the strange amazing Sight, That scar'd him the preceding Night; But added, he cou'd scarce believe But that the Devil did deceive. Hilda, who knew her Mistress well, Conceiv'd how 'twas, but wou'd not tell; And therefore readily concluded It was the Devil himself intruded, Which to confirm, she said, her Mother, As virtuous Wife as any other, In the same Room was seen, by Ned, With Ralph the Plough-boy clasp'd in Bed; And shou'd not wonder had it been Her own Resemblance he had seen: Her Lady's Honour thus was shewn, As much unsully'd as her own; And Murdac now, by Oath, agreed, That on the Morrow they shou'd wed: Then, hugging closer yet at parting, She went within, and he to carting. The Doctor's Stomach, now, was keen, As any Doctor's e'er had been; The Dinner, too, was serv'd in Plenty, Instead of Four, enough for Twenty; But Exercise did make them eat With such Profusion, that they sweat: To Hubert, who was lately ill, Juetta sent a Plate of Veal; And, that her Goodness more might shine, A Glass or two of gen'rous Wine. The Dinner done, the Talk of Fashions, By wild Transition, turn'd to Passions: Good Galfred judg'd, the Thirst of Gain It's Empire here did most maintain; While, in Juetta's Thoughts, the Mind To Pride and Pow'r was most inclin'd: The Doctor, then, with solemn Air, Did thus his well-fix'd Thoughts declare. âTo reason right of this Machine, âWe ought, with Judgement, first begin; âAnd, in pursuance, have Recourse âTo universal Nature's Source; âWhich, Parent of the World, replete âWith vegetative Life and Heat, âWe find the Animal Creation, âBy strong Impulse, or Destination, âWith Passions, turbulent, and mad, â(Productive still of all that's bad) âTho' forc'd to act, have yet, besides, âReason and Instinct, for their Guides: âThe first, the most exalted, suits âWith Man; the other governs Brutes: âBy these, inordinate Desires âAre tam'd, as Order well requires, âWhich else, by impudent Intrusion, âWould breed eternal, wild Confusion: âAnd Lust, by far above the Rest, âIs, sure, the most unruly Beast: âBut Love, by gentle Courtship, tends, âWith soft Approach, to gain his Ends, âTho', with no less impetuous Force, âHe, blindly, still pursues his Course, âAbove all Obstacles or Bars, âUnmov'd with Dangers, Pains, or Fears. âI grant, Ambition, Int'rest, Pride, âAnd all the Heart can wish beside, âWith keen Pursuit we much approve, âBut all to serve the Ends of Love: âTh' ambitious Prince that wins a Crown, âAt Beauty's Feet will lay it down: âThe Miser offers all his Store, âTo her he cannot help adore: âAnd where's the Monarch wou'd not crave âTo be to Love an humble Slave? âOr, where's the Princess wou'd not deign, âIf urg'd by Love, prefer a Swain. âThro' ev'ry Age, what Revolutions, âHave slow'd from Warmth of Constitutions? â'Twas Love alone, impell'd by Fate, âThat overturn'd the Trojan State; â'Twas Love, tho' full of soul Disgrace, âThat banish'd Tarquin's Royal Race; âWhat, but a Dart by Cupid hurl'd, âThat lost great Anthony the World? âBut needless 'twere to mention more, âTo shew the arbitrary Pow'r, âFor all throughout the World does prove, âNo Passion sways so much as Love; âAnd this will, surely, ev'ry one, âThat speaks the Truth, most freely own; âFor Reasons good indeed, confest, âWe keep the Foible in our Breast; âBut either Sex alike is giv'n âTo taste this Joy, dispens'd by Heaven. The Doctor paus'd! and stroak'd the Hair Of Clara, standing by his Chair: Then thus went on.ââ'Tis just we own âThis Passion, so prevailing shewn, âShou'd have it's Bounds, which else might cause âSubversion of all social Laws; âFor, Madam, were you but to know âThe Actions that from hence do flow, âYour wonder'd rise to such a Height, âYou'd scarce have Pow'r to sleep at Night: âAnd had I Time or Leave to tell, âThe odd Adventures have befell, âWithin the Course of my Vocation, âTo those of ev'ry Rank and Station, âYou'd want no other Proofs, to shew âThat Love is absolute below. âTo reap Success, what Arts have been? âWhat Metamorphoses are seen? âThe wrinkled Dame, in youthful Dress, âAffects the Airs of flaunting Miss; âWhile Beaus in Climaterick, court, âTo make the younger Fellows Sport: âThe sage Philosopher, or Fool, âTo Love alike becomes the Tool: âAnd often Wisdom, changing Sides âWith Folly, ev'ry Tongue derides: âYet, notwithstanding Satire's Goad, âAll trudge along in Nature's Road: âBut sometimes great Disasters follow, âWhen, underneath, the Way is hollow; âAnd then the Traveller, in spight âOf Care, is found in dirty Plight. âAnd here I might, with Ease, relate âThe many Ills on Lechers wait, âWho, without Reason or Restraint, âWill venture all for what they want: âWhat Jealousies and Feuds ensue, âWith Rapes, Disease, and Bloodshed too. âBut my Profession bids conceal âWhat Doctors of the Church may tell, âWho, as Reformers of the Time, âShou'd freely speak of ev'ry Crime: âEnough it is for me, to prove âThe universal Bent of Love. âIn consequence of this Assertion, âI'll tell you something for Diversion. âA Parson's Wife, I dare not name, âTo quench the Heat of am'rous Flame, âUnluckily, by sad Mischance, âAcquir'd the Malady of France; âWhich, as the Claim of Wedlock's Right, âHer Husband shar'd with some Delight; â(For they, to speak the Truth, were known âA Couple fond as were in Town): âThe Parson, he, poor Man, who thought âA little Toying was no Fault, âBefore he knew the sad Disaster, âBy Contact made it spread the faster; âAnd all the Parish round outright âWere found to be in Martha's Plight.â Good Galfred laugh'd like one bewitch'd, And both Juetta's Sides were stitch'd; Again compos'd, again they smil'd, To find the Age so very wild, While each, by Self-conviction, knew The Doctor's Arguments were true: The Bottle outâthey all agree, The Doctor wentâbut took his Fee. Now Hilda came, with serious Air, Her destin'd Marriage to declare; That Murdac had the Licence ready For Morrow's Rites, if please her Lady: Juetta with Consent agreed, And Galfred wish'd the Match succeed; Then order'd they shou'd get the best Of all the Farm, for Wedding Feast; The Men had Leave to cease from Labours, And Hilda bid t'invite the Neighbours; Hubert, whose Int'rest in the Bride, To please in all he cou'd, did guide, Went forth to ask, without Delay, Whom Hilda pleas'd, to grace the Day. In walking down the winding Dale, The gath'ring Clouds and rustling Gale A speedy Show'r of Rain portended, And here and there big Drops descended. Low in the Bottom sunk, there lay A Winding Copse along the Way, At Foot of which a narrow Brook It's leafy Branches overlook; There, at a Distance, Hubert spy'd, Upon a rotten Hovel's Side, A Group of Gipsies, sitting round A Fire of Brushwood on the Ground, In various Attitudes; behind, A Smoke, that's driven by the Wind Athwart the Copse; the colour'd Bow With splendid Majesty did shew, Whose circling Arms, expanded, stood As on the Hill and on the Wood. The Rain encreasing, Hubert stretch'd His Pace, and soon the Hovel reach'd; Here, round the Blaze, employ'd, he saw Some Ten or Twelve in Works of Straw; While others cook'd, in Kettle boiling, A Kind of Food, with Sweat turmoiling: A tatter'd Crew of Human Creatures, With swarthy Skins and haggar'd Features, Men, Women, Children, half array'd, In Garbs of various Remnants made: One, giving Suck with Satchel Dugs, The sprawling Bastard roughly hugs; Another Beldame bears the Load, In Bandage swath'd, of tawny Blood: The rest, a wild and ragged Rabble, Or sing, or work, or dance, or babble; Yet all, in chearful Mirth, receive The Refuse, Nature seem'd to give. Hubert, approaching with a Smile, Within the Threshold stood awhile; Then ask'd, of One who seem'd the Head, What Way of Life it was they led. To whom old Orcan, now their Guide, In broken Language thus reply'd: âOur Rule of Life's in Nature grounded, âOn which our Government is founded: âHer ample Stores, we find, are given, âImpartially bestow'd, by Heav'n: âThe Hawthorn Berry on the Tree, âTo ev'ry Bird alike is free; âAnd ev'ry Bough's obscurest Shade, âA safe Retreat for all was made: âNo selfish Views excite our Pride, âContent, if barely Want's supply'd, âWhich, if the pamper'd Wretch refuses, âWe sometimes take to serve our Uses; âBut never offer to offend âHim that is human Nature's Friend: âUncrampt by foolish Laws, to bind âThe noble Freedom of the Mind, âThro' ev'ry Realm we freely rove, âAnd freely taste the Joys of Love: âWhat you, like Hypocrites, conceal, âWe boldly act, and freely tell; âYet have we Laws, to give Protection âTo mutual Fondness; or Affection: âOur Maxim is,âConsent is lightâ âBut not t' invade each other's Right; âAnd we as freely lend or borrow âA Wifeâto pay again the Morrow: âThus, well content, our Life is sweet, âWe scorn the Slave, and mock the Great.â Hubert, well pleas'd, so much to find A Rule, that suited well his Mind, With courteous Carriage took his Leave, When Mopsa pull'd him by the Sleeve; A plump, young, wanton, forward Jade, And perfect Mistress of her Trade; Who slily made him understand What Fortune 'twas to cross her Hand; Which, Hubert, with complying Grace, By Tester won, and, tap'd her Face. This she receiv'd, and, leering, said, She knew he lov'd a pretty Maid; Then, parting laughing, Hubert took The lower Way along the Brook, And passing Farmer Osmund's Grounds, Soon enter'd honest Galfred's Bounds. The Author here Repugnance shew'd, To stain his Tale with spilling Blood; And adds, that, rather than be cruel, He'd fed them all with Water Gruel; Then, after some Reflections cast On Glutton Man, as worse than Beast, (Which, in good Manners, we think fit, As much too pinching, to omit) Proceeds as follows:âHigh in Air, The busy Swarms of Gnats appear; On dewy Grass are seen the Trails Of slimy Slugs, and horned Snails; The feather'd Fowl are all at Roost, And Daylight, now, is almost lost; When, Hubert order'd they shou'd slay The Victims offer'd for the Day. Two Pigs are taken from the Sty, And butcher'd there with murd'rous Cry; With clam'rous Flight, Twelve Barn-door Pullets, By Blanche are catch'd, who cuts their Gullets; The tragick Scene, that, next, succeeds, Is of ten Ducks that lose their Heads: Poor Clara, mov'd to hear their Cries, Grew pale, and turn'd away her Eyes: The Slaughter done, 'twou'd be Detention, Of lesser Matters here to mention: Suffice we say, that all was ready, As order'd was by Lord and Lady; And all observ'd what Galfred saidâ âWho'd early riseâmust go to Bed,â Where tho', perhaps, not much was acted, They dreamt of Pranks to be transacted. Now, when the Night, at Break of Day. Like a sly Thief had stol'n away, They all begin to rub their Eyes, And, rous'd with Expectation, rise; A short Repast, you well may guess, Suffic'd to give them Time to dress. Hilda, with all the Flags of Beauty Was grac'd, to tempt, as was her Duty; Murdac was also mainly deckt, And claim'd from Peasants high Respect: The Bridemen, and the Bridemaids too, Were tidy clad, for all was new: Thus, ready all, they walk to Church In friendly Pairs, and wait in Porch, Till Parson comesâlike Ketch with Halterâ To do his Officeâat the Altar. Some said, that, on this grave Occasion, The Parson made some Hesitation: To speak the Truth, 'twas really hinted The Doctor oft at Hilda squinted; That when he saw her Bubbies rise, He lick'd his Lips, and roll'd his Eyes; Howe'er this was, the Knot was ty'd, And Hubert gave away the Bride, Well knowing he (as Fathers deign To give) like themâmight take again. The Rites concluded, home they bent Their Way, in Order, as they went. Hubert now taps a Cask, to taste The Beer he brew'd October past, And fill'd a Bumper all around, To wish their Joy might much abound. Now, Maud and Lucy, Blanche and Rose, Have not one Moment for Repose; The Pies are made, the Oven heated, The Fire spread, the Beef is spitted, A Brace of Carp from Mill is sent A Present made to Galfred meant, With whom the Parson was to dine, Invited to a fav'rite Chine: While all the rest, both great and small, Are left to cram and stuff in Hall. Strait in come Gaffer D?? and Polly, With Agnes, Christian, Dick and Dolly, And Yeoman B??????'s Sister S??????, That married Richard at the Harrow; With many more, a gawky Rout That came from ev'ry Part about: Murdac and Hilda each attends To welcome in their honest Friends, Who shaking Hands, with snigg'ring Faces, Hang up their Hats to take their Places; While Hubert trips about most featly, And smiles at all the Girls most sweetly. The Crowd, increasing thick, is great, And some impatient areâto eat: Baldwin, at length, does spread the Table, And all squeese in as well as able: Eustace and Oswald, Hodge and Tom, Attend to serve, as known at Home. The Dishes now in Rank they place, But all forget to say the Grace: Roast-Beef, and Fowls with Bacon boil'd, Were soon of comely Form despoil'd; The Hams and Tongues of Relish high, With Roast and Boil'd, with Stew and Fry, Plumb Puddings, Apple Pies and Custard, With Ducks and Udders roast, with Mustard, Soon shar'd the Fate of all the rest, As each took what he lik'd the best: The roasted Pigs and Pies, with Meat, With scrambling Appetite, they eat: Yet nothing happen'd much amiss, Tho' so much streaming Sauce and Grease, Except, that by a little Folly, A Custard fell 'twixt Dick and Dolly. The Dinner ended, Pipes and Liquor Were brought, to make their Spirits quicker: The Bride and Lasses all were kist With slabb'ring Mouth, and griping Fist; And Johnny Trim, the Fiddler, came To raise their Mirth, tho' blind and lame: With Jokes and Catches round they quaff, And thump and tickle, pinch and laugh; While Tibald loll'd like any Fool, Sly Christian whipp'd away the Stool, But catching Cicely's Legs, the Bear Did thrust his HandsâI know not where: Eustace a Pack of Cards produc'd, But something soil'd for being us'd, And at All Fours with Lucy sate, With Lump of Chalk, to play a Bett: But Dancing being now approv'd, The Chairs and Tables soon were mov'd; The Partners, standing in the Middle, And Trim in Corner with his Fiddle; They foot and trip it round about To Back and Belly, in and out, Till tir'd with Sweat, and light in Head, Hilda and Murdac stole to Bed. The Company with Galfred, spent Their Time no less in Merriment; For, warm'd with Liquor well within, They little thought of any Sin; While Galfred with the Doctor broke, At several Times, some smutty Joke. And now, by Clara it was blown Where Bride and Bridegroom both were gone, When all, with Galfred at their Head, Went up, and catch'd them both in Bed; The Stocking then in Knot was ty'd For every one to fling at Bride, Which when, with usual Uproar, done In just Progression, one by one, Good Galfred order'd, in a trice, Burnt Elder Wine, with Cloves and Spice, Of which three Tankards being spent, Away the reeling Rabble went, And left them quietly enjoy The lawful Means to get a Boy. Thus far we think it fit to shew How Nature operates below. Our modest Author here has hid What Hubert thought, or what he did; But this assures, Juetta, gone Nine Months with Child, brought forth a Son; And Hilda too, t' increase the Joy, The self-same Day produc'd a Boy: That Galfred, with triumphant Air, Rejoic'd he'd got a Son and Heir; And all the Country round did ring The wond'rous Art of Doctor K???. The little Clara, sweetest Flow'r To grace the Front of Beauty's Bow'r, By native Charms, unmix'd with Art, Engag'd so strongly Hubert's Heart, That, five Years after, both became One Will, one Interest, and one Name, And in a neighb'ring Farm were plac'd, By Galfred's gen'rous Bounty grac'd. Thus ends the Story we relate, To shew the Bent of human State; And hence we dare assert, that all Of either Sex, both great and small, From Adam down to you that read, Must ownââThat Nature still will lead.â Tho' here we must, by just Connection, Yet add this cautious wise Reflection; âThat dang'rous Passions of the Mind Shou'd be, by Reason, well confin'd, For Honour is the surest Guard, And Virtue only can reward. THE END.</field>
