      <field name="fulltext">TO THE TRVE Generall Patron of all Muses, Musitians, Poets, &amp; Picture Drawers, Syr Christopher Clutch-Fist, Knighted at a very hard Peny-worth neither for eating Musk-millions, Hanchouis or C[illeg.] but for a costlier Exployt, and a Hundred pound Feate of Armes; Oliuer Hubburd, brother to the Nine-wayting-Gentlewomen, the Muses, wisheth the decrease of his Lands, &amp; the Encrease of his Legges, that his Calues may hang downe like Ga?rimshawe?s. The Ant, and the Nightingale. The west-Seas Goddesse in a crimson Robe, Her Temples circled with a currall wreathe, Waighted her Loue, the lightner of Earths Globe, The wanton winde did on her bosome breathe; The Nimphs of Springs did hollowed water power, What ere was cold, helpt to make coole her Bower. And now the fiery Horses of the Sun Were from their golden-flaming Car vntrac'de, And all the Glorie of the day was done, Saue here and there some Lightmoone-clouds in chac'de, A partie-coloured-Canopie did spread Ouer the Sun and Thetis amorous bed. Now had the Shepheards folded in their Flocks The sweating Teemes vncoupled from their yokes; The wolfe sought pray, and the slie-murdring Foxe Attempts to steale; fearelesse of rurall stroakes All beasts tooke rest that liued by labouring Toile, Onely such rang'de as had delight in spoile. Now in the Pathlesse region of the Ayre, The winged passengers had left to soare: Except the Bat and Owle who bode sad care, And Philomel that nightly doth deplore In soule-contenting tunes her change of shape, Wrought first by perfidy and lustfull Rape. This poore Musitian sitting all alone On a greene Hawthorne, from the thunder blest Carolls in varied notes her antique mone, Keeping a sharpned Brier against her brest: Her innocence this watchfull payne doth take, To shun the Adder and the speckled Snake. These two like her old foe the Lord of Thrace, Regardlesse of her dulcet changing song, To serue their owne lust haue her life in chace: Vertue by vice is offred endlesse wrong. Beasts are not all to blame, for now and then We see the like attempted amongst men. Vnder the tree whereon the poore Bird sate, There was a Bed of busie-toyling Ants, That in their Sommer, winters comfort gat, Teaching poore men how to shun after wants: Whose Rules if sluggards could be learnt to keepe, They should not starue awake, lye cold asleepe. One of these busy Brethren hauing donne His dayes true Labour got vpon the tree: And with his litle nimble Legs did runne, Pleasde with the hearing, he desirde to see What wondrous Creature Nature had composde, In whome such Gratious Musick was enclosde. He got too neare: for the mistrustfull bird Gest him to be a spye from her knowne foe: Suspition argues not to heare a word, What wiseman feares not that's invr'de to woe? Then blame not her, she caught him in her beake, About to kill him ere the worme could speake. But yet her mercy was aboue her heate She did not as a many silken men Cald by much wealth, smal wit, to Iudgements seate, Condemne at random; but she pittyed then When she might spoyle, would great ones would do so Who often kill, before the Cause they know. O if they would as did this little Fowle, Looke on their lesser Captiues with euen Ruth: They should not heare so many sentencde, Howle, Complayning Iustice is not friend to truth: But they would thinke vpon this Antient Theame, Each Right extreame, is Iniury extreame! Passe them to mend, for none can them amend, But heauens Leiftenant, and earths-Iustice King, Sterne will, hath will; no great-one wants a friend, Some are ordaynde to sorrow, some to sing; And with their sentence let thy Griefes all close Who ere are wrongd, are happier then their foes. So much for such, now to the little Ant In the Birds beake and at the point to die: Alas for woe, friends in distresse are scant, None of his Fellowes to his Helpe did hie: They keepe them safe, they heare and are afraid: Tis vaine to trust in the Base numbers aide: Onely himselfe vnto himselfe is friend, With a faint voice his Foe he thus bespake: Why seekes your gentlenes a poore wormes end; O ere you kill, heare the excuse I make: I come to wonder, not to worke offence: There is no Glorie to spoile Innocence! Perchance you take me for a soothing Spye, By the slie Snake or enuious Adder feede: Alas I know not how to faine and lye, Or win a base Intelligencers meede, That now are Christians, sometime Turks, then Iewes, Liuing by leauing Heauen for earthly Newes! Trust me: I am a little Emmet borne to worke, Oft times a man, as you were once a maide: Vnder the name of man much ill doth hirke, Yet of poore men you neede not be afraid: Meane men are wormes on whom the mightye tread, Greatnes and strength your Vertue iniured. With that she opend wide her hornie Bill, The prison where this poore submissant lay: And seeing the poore Ant lie quiuering still, Goe wretch, quoth she: I giue thee life and way: The worthy will not pray on yeelding things, Pittie's inscoffed to the bloud of Kings! For I was once, though now a featherde vaile Couer my wronged Bodie Queenelike clad This downe about my neck was earst a Raile Of Bisse embrodered, fie on that we had Vnthrifts and Fooles and wronged once Complaine Rich things were theirs, must nere be theirs againe. I was thou know'st the Daughter to a King, Had pallaces and pleasures in my time: Now mine owne songs I am enforc'd to sing, Poets forget me in their pleasing rime, Like chaffe they fly tost with each windie breath Omitting my fore'st Rape by Tereus death! But tis no matter: I my selfe can sing Sufficient straines to witnesse mine owne worth, They that forget a Queene, sooth with a King, Flatterie's still barren, yet still bringeth forth, Their workes are dewes, shed when the day is donne But suckt vp drie by the next mornings Sun! What more of them? they are like Iris throne, Commixt with many Colours in moyst time: Such lines portend what's in that circle showne: Cleere weather followes showers in euery Clime, Auerring no Prognosticator lyes That sayes, some Great ones fall, their Riualls rise! Passe such for Bubbles, let their bladder-prayse Shine and sinck with them in a moments change: They thinke to rise, when they the Riser rayse But regall wisedome knowes it is not strange For Curs to fawne, base things are euer lowe, The vulgar Eye feeds onely on the showe: Else would not soothing Glosers oyle the Sonne, Who, while his Father liude his Acts did hate: They know all earthly day with man is donne When he is circled in the Night of Fate, So the deceased they thinke on no more, But whom they iuiur de late they now adore. But there's a Manly Lion now can Rore, Thunder more dreaded then the Lionesse: Of him let simple beasts his ayde implore, For he conceiues more, then they can expresse. The vertuous Politick, is truly man, Diuell, the Atheist, Polititian. I gest thee such a one: but tell thy tale, If thou be simple as thou hast exprest: Doe not with Coyned words set wit to sale; Nor with the Flattring world vse vayne protest. Sith man thou fayst thou wert, I prethee tell While thou wert man, what mischiefs thee befell? Princess! you bid me buried cares reuiue, Quoth the poore Ant; yet sith by you I liue: So let me in my dayly labrings thriue, As I my selfe doe to your seruice giue: I haue bene oft a man, and so to be, Is often to be thrall to misery. But if you will haue me my mind disclose, I must entreat you that I may set downe The tales of my black fortunes in sad prose: Rime is vneuen, fashiond by a Clowne: I first was such a one, I Tild the Ground, And amongst Ruralls verse is scarcely found. Well, tell thy tales: but see thy prose be good: For if thou Euphuize which once was rare, And of all English Phrase the life and blood, In those times for the fashion past compare, Ile say thou borrowest, and condemne thy Stile: As our new fooles, that count all following vile. Or if in Bitternes thou raile like Nash, Forgiue me honest Soule, that tearme thy phrase Rayling, for in thy workes thou wert not rash, Nor didst affect in youth thy priuate praise, Thou hadst a strife with that Trigemius Thou hurtst not them till they had iniurde thee. Thou wast indeede too slothfull to thy selfe, Hiding thy better tallent in thy Spleene: True spirits are not couetous in pelfe, Youths wit is euer ready quick and keene: Thou didst not liue thy ripened Autumne day, But wert cut off in thy best blooming may. Else hadst thou left as thou indeede hast left Sufficient Test, though now in others Chests T'improue the basenes of that humorous theft Which seemes to flow from selfe-conceiuing Brests: Thy name they burie, hauing buried thee Drones eate thy Honnie, thou wert the true Bee. Peace keepe thy Soule: And now to you Sir Ant, On with your Prose, be neither rude nor nise, In your discourse let no Decorum want: See that you be sententious and concise, And as I like the matter, I will sing A Canzonet to close vp euery thing. The Nightingales Canzonet. Poore little Ant, Thou shalt not want, The rauish't Musicke of my voyce. Thy shape is best, Now thou art least, For Great Ones fall with greater noyse: And this shall be the Marriage of my Song, Small Bodyes can haue but a little wrong. Now thou art securer, And thy Dayes farre surer, Thou payste no Rent vpon the Racke, To dawbe a prodigall Land-lords backe: Or to maintaine the subtill running Of Dice and Drabs, both one in Cunning. Both passe from hand to hand to many, Flattring all, yet false to any: Both are well linck't: fore throw Dice how you can, They will turne vp their Peepes to euery man. Happie art thou, and all thy brothers, That neuer feelst the Hell of others: The torment to a luxur due, Who neuer thinkes his harlot true, Although vpon her heels he stick his eyes, Yet still he feares, that though she stands, she lyes. Now are thy labours easie, Thy state not sick or queasies, All drops thou sweatst are now thine owne, Great Subsidies be as vnknowne To thee, and to thy litle fellow Ants, Now none of you vnder that burthen pants. Loe for Example, I my selfe, poore wormes, That haue out-worne the rage of Tereus stormes: Am euer blest now in this downy shape, From all mans Trechery, or soule-melting Rape: And when I sing Tereu, Tereu, Through euery Towne, and so renew The name of Tereus, slaues through feares, With guilty Fingers bolt their eares: All rauishers do raue, and e'en fall mad, And then such wrongd soules as my selfe are glad. So thou small wretch and all thy Nest, Are in those litle bodies blest; Not taxt beyond your poore degree, With Landlords Fine, and Lawyers Fee. But tell me prety-toiling worme, Did that same Plough-mans weary forme Discourage thee so much from others, That neither thou, nor those thy brothers, In borrowed shapes durst once agen Venture amongst perfidious men, Yet Lady, the poore Ant replied, I left not so, but then I tried Wars sweating Fortunes, not alone Condemning rash all states for one, Vntill I found by proofe, and knew by course, That one was bad, but all the rest were worse. Nightingale. Didst thou put on a rugged Souldier then? A happie state, because thou fought'st gainst men? Prethee discourse, thy fortunes, state and harmes, Thou wast no doubt, A mighty man at Armes? The Nightingale. Oh twas a prety quaint deceite, (The Nightingale began to sing) To slip from those that lie in waite, Whose touch is like a Rauens wing, Fatall and ominous, which being spred, Ouer a mortall, aimes him dead. Alas poore Emmet thou wa'st tost In thousand miseries by this shape: Thy colour wasted, thy bloud lost, Thy limbes broke, with the violent Rape Of hot impatient Cannons, which desire To rauish lifes, spending their lust in fire, Oh what a ruthfull Sight it is, to see Though in a Souldier of the mean'st degree, That right member perisht, Which the body cherisht: That Limbe disseased, burnt, and gon, Which the best part was borne vpon; And then the greatest truth of all, Returning some more ofte: Where be the old rise, there so oft to fall, Trod downe with enve [illeg.] with [illeg.] Yet wretch, for this day comfort be, That greates wormes haue fame like thee. By this the Day began to spring, And seaze vpon her watchful eies: When more Tree-Queristers did sing, And euery Bird did wake and rise: Which was no sooner seene and heard, But all their prety chat was mard: And then she saide, We are betraide, The day is vp, and all the birds, And they abroad will blab our words, With that she bad the Ants farewell, And all they likewise Philomel: Away she flew, Crying Tereu! And all the Industrious Ants in throngs, Fell to their worke, and held their toongs. FINIS.</field>
