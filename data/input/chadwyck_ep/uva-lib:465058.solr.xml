      <field name="fulltext">THE FATAL KISS. A POEM. Spirit of Charity, direct my Pen! To thee I dedicate the pensive Strain: Thou know'st my motives; and thou see'st my heart, As full of anguish, as devoid of art! Benignly stooping from thy bright abode, Fast by the awful right-hand of thy God, Wou'd'st thou my burning bosom but inspire, And touch my hallow'd numbers with thy fire; Like the rare aloe, whose expiring root With one last effort vig'rously doth shoot, And from its barrenness sublimely rise, Blooming, and breathing incense to the skies;— Sweet should ascend the incense of my breath, And life push forth her fairest bloom in death! But ah! no inspirations glow along The artless accents of my feeble song! Though sorrow lends, of sighs, a swelling gale, While Truth thus dictates my unvarnish'd tale. RAMBLING abroad one eve in May, When gentle wishes warm the blood, I chanc'd to stray, Where in the windings of a wood A weary youth, beneath an oak, Lay wrapt in sleep, So sweet! so deep! That scarce the shrilling trumpet's sound, From hill to valley ecchoing round, His balmy slumbers would have broke. His folded arms a cushion made Whereon to rest his drooping head, And gently propt his downward face, From pressing on the dewy grass. Yet, as he slept, one downy cheek, As roses red, as velvet sleek! And half the arching of his brow, And half the deep fringe of his eye, Decking their pillow, one might spy, And spying, full of rapture grow. Plenteous adown his comely back His locks in waving ringlets fell, More glossy than the turtle's neck, And browner than the filberd's shell! For pleasant lightness he did wear A jacket of green casimier, Which round his form so fairly sat, That all its symmetry thereat Appear'd;—and challeng'd art and wit To cavil at, or rival it. To a loose sash of softest silk, And whiter than the whitest milk, Hung round his neck, his pipe was tied, And dangled, careless, at his side: His polish'd crook, with ribbons bound, Which wreaths of painted flowrets crown'd, Beside him lay, as seeming made In frolic, by no vulgar lad, But by a youth, who well did know, It favour'd less of use, than show Ah! if Endymion look'd as fair, No mighty marvel, sure! it were That Dian, 'midst her high career, Paus'd, silvering, on the front of night, And borrow'd a new ray of light, Clearer to see the sleeping boy, And snatch him to a brighter joy! A panting pleasure, soft and new, Like witchcraft, through my pulses flew The while I gaz'd, and sweetly stole To the recesses of my soul. Ah dangerous pleasure! subtle ill! Which smil'd, the more secure to kill. Nearer I crept, and as each bush Rustled its leaves, I whisper'd,—hush! Bann'd ev'ry breath, tho' soft as love, That gently murmur'd thro' the grove, And dreaded ev'ry step I trod, Lest balmy sleep's incumbent god, His downy pinions, with surprise, Should gather from the charmer's eyes. Now at his heaving side I stood, And, wond'ring! his perfections view'd: Now, stooping o'er his glowing cheek, A nearer, dearer view I seek. His dimpled chin, which did bewray A nest, where Love himself might lay, As sweet he slumber'd, seem'd to rest Upon his white, and ample chest. His ruby lips, a straw asunder, Utter'd such soft, such perfum'd breath, That ev'n a wonder It seem'd, such sweetness liv'd beneath The cope of heav'n! while all around The balmy dew that waits on sleep, When youth is sane, and wealth is sound, His temples, and his chin did steep. O! how I felt my bosom warm! And where wou'd be the wond'rous harm, I softly whisper'd to my soul, If the dear bliss, Of one sweet kiss, My longing lips, delighted stole? The poorer he wou'd not awake, Tho' I shou'd keep it for his sake. My ready lips, my wish obey'd; Ah! witless, and unguarded maid! Cou'd'st thou not ken that greedy love With one, wou'd ne'er contented prove, But like th'insatiate bee wou'd sip Repeated honey from his lip? Silent, I kiss'd, and kiss'd again; Soft transports throbb'd in every vein, While the sweet breath I gently stole, Seem'd to create another soul Within my breast, and o'er my will Delicious poison to distil: Yet different from the snared fly Which doth of too much honey die, The more of sweetness I enjoy'd, The less my appetite was cloy'd. Alas! how little did I ween, That deadly bitterness within The vessel flow'd, whose sugar'd lip I thus delighted was, to sip! But prudence, now, began to start, And maiden modesty my heart, Blushing, reprov'd, as wanton grown, And little knowing of her own To cast the graceful bounds aside Of female dignity and pride; Much marvelling, what pow'rful cause, Had made me slight the sacred laws Of Virtue, whose bright crown, till now, Unsullied sat upon my brow! O! had I heard the angel's tongue, Or wisely heeded, when she sung, I had not yielded up my name, A tainted theme, for blasting fame! But one kiss more, I fondly said, And then thy calls shall be obey'd! Unhappy Harriet! to its woe Thy heedless heart this truth shall know, That all delays may dangerous prove, But most of all, delays in love! The fatal kiss! I fondly took, And with my kiss the youth awoke. Amaz'd! he starts, stares wildly round, Then springing lightly from the ground, Exclaims;—“my god! what angel's this, Who wakes me with a nectar'd kiss! Nay, charmer nay, you must not fly, Nor yet my longing lips deny Those pouting cherries to attack, And take their own, with interest, back—” Trembling, and mute, with shame, and dread, I hung abash'd my silly head, And suffer'd his warm lips to join With many a melting kiss to mine: But rouz'd, at last, with new alarms, I struggled in his clasping arms, And, weeping, begg'd him to forbear, Nor think he held a wanton there: “Who, and what art thou then?”—he said:— “A simple, but an honest maid; “Nor need I blush to own a name “Untainted by the breath of fame; “They call me Harriet of the hill: “Unhand me!—you have had your will!” “Now nay, my charmer, that wou'd be “To pass a happy life with thee! “But pardon if my hasty love “At first, did too presumptuous prove, “For by thy manners I can trace “Thou art not sprung of lowly race: “Then let respect, I pray thee! gain, “What rudeness ought not to obtain: “Long have thy dazzling beauties made “A heav'n of this sequester'd shade! “And near the borders of this dell, “With thee, do all the graces dwell! “Perhaps a temper like my own “Has made thee quit the noisy town, “Where vice, and folly, lordly ride, “And wisdom yields the palm to pride! “Tir'd of the busy haunts of men, “I sought this sweet sequester'd glen, “Dropt senseless show, assum'd the swain, “And mingled with the rural train “Whose guileless manners, best I find “Attemper'd to my artless mind.”— He said:—and if his sleeping charms Cou'd cause my bosom such alarms, What wonder, that his sparkling eye, Where love his bright artillery hung, His gentle grace, sweet courtesy, And all the music of his tongue, Shou'd win my fond believing heart, To utter all he wish'd to hear, Or that his soft insidious art, Shou'd lull each friendly terror there? “A hapless Orphan—I replied,— “You view in me; and right you trace, “Tho', in my manners, ill espied! “That I can boast a generous race:— “But poor my state, tho' rich my blood, “The slender heritage I claim, “A dying uncle's hand bestow'd, “To tenant which, I lately came:— “Once in a world of gilded cares, “Not to the gay, and great unknown, “I liv'd, till by its fatal snares, “My noble parents were undone:— “From scenes of luxury, fraud, and strife, “Well might I, loathing! wish to part: “They reft a gracious father's life, “And broke a tender mother's heart! “Two miles from hence an humble cot, “Hides, from the world, my orphan head, “Where, by the gay, and great forgot, “Health spreads my board, and peace my bed.— “Yet friends I have, of worthy name, “That deign to prize an artless maid, “Who, haply, some regard may claim, “In truth, and spotless honor, clad:— “Allow this boast!—and, O! believe “Howe'er one bold, incautious deed, “Maiden reserve may not forgive, “Virtue, thro' life, has been my meed, “And throughout life, shall rule my heart.” “I doubt it not!—he quick replied;— “Nor ever by a villain's art, “Be thy dear bosom's blessing tried: “Awful respect, and trembling love, “Shall make it sacred still to me; “Edward, its faithful guard wou'd prove, “But never wou'd its spoiler be.”— So some fair flowers the charmed sense, Lull with the fragrance of their breath, The while their treacherous sweets dispense Distemper and the pains of death— But now the evening's dusky veil Was thrown o'er every object round, Unwholesome dews, more frequent fell, And fogs rose, steaming from the ground: “Night gathers round;—the tempter cried,— “Here let our gentle parley break, “Lest baleful damps, the blooming pride, “Shou'd damage, on thy lovely cheek: “Hard by this dear, this rural spot, “Where first he felt love's soft alarms, “Thy Edward owns a little cot, “Whose roof shall shelter thee from harms: “Thither thy gracious steps shall bend, “If I've found favor in thy sight, “Till the pale moon her beams shall lend “To light thy pathway thro' the night. “This little subtersuge of love “My fair one sees, and pardons too.— “Ah! let it not fallacious prove, “To one so tender, and so true!— “What starving wretch, whose lucky hand “Hath on a treasure chanc'd to light, “At once, his temper can command “To trust that treasure from his sight?” “Prudence forbids;—I must not go;— “Already have I err'd too far!” “My lovely Harriet, say not so, “And cast away this squeamish fear; “Beneath my roof vouchsafe to rest, “Till night's fair queen assume her reign, “And then my steps shall be addrest, “To guard thee safely home again!” “Urge me no more!—it cannot be: “Too late already have I staid.”— “Ah! alter this unkind decree, “Let me beseech thee, noble maid! “Let bosoms deeply read in art “With narrow cautions poorly move, “But let not thy superior heart “A bugbear make of generous love!” He said; and saying, gently took My half reluctant, trembling hand, With such a sweet persuasive look! Ah! why cou'd not my heart withstand! Blushing, and silent, half afraid, Yet not displeas'd, he led me on, Led a poor fond, and artless maid, To be, by villainy, undone! What pen can speak the soothing talk His soft tongue pour'd into my ear, Lest, mindful of the tedious walk, My soul shou'd feel presaging fear! Alas! too sure! the syren's song My cooler, better thoughts denied, Nor cou'd I think the path-way long, With such a charmer at my side.— Before we reach'd the fatal place, Ordain'd to ruin all my joy! The moon illumin'd night's dark face, And hung her silver lamp on high: Sweetly it gilt th'enchanting spot Where, seated on a verdant mound, I saw the unassuming cot, With blooming hawthorn compass'd round; Chearful, and yet retir'd it stood, Its walls with myrtle cover'd o'er, Behind, appear'd a lofty wood, A velvet lawn the front before— A river, cross whose curling face, An ivy'd bridge its arches flung Without did gently winding pass, O'er which a weeping willow hung Drinking the water as it flow'd;— Alas! false man! a type of thee; The drooping willow truly show'd, As did the hollow bridge of thee! Within a simple elegance The mansion and its owner grac'd, As void of dull magnificence, As every where replete with taste.— The whole appear'd a quiet scene, Too circumscrib'd for pride, or state, But comfort seem'd to smile within, And rural ease, without the gate.— “Welcome! thrice welcome! heav'nly fair, He cried, “To Edward's humble cot! “Be distant every frown of care, “And every sorrow be forgot! “Nor shalt thou quit my lowly roof, “Till thou hast eaten of my bread, “Of growing love, the pleasing proof, “And sign, that every doubt is fled.” Alas! I had but gone too far, A trifling favor to deny; Yet, granting, dropt a silent tear, And heav'd a soft prophetic sigh— To calm my justly trembling heart, Each fond, each winning way he tried, And sought by every soothing art, To lull asleep my maiden pride: To plunder, thus, the honey'd hive, Of the collected sweets of spring, The Bee to stupify we strive, And lay asleep her guardian sting.— Now, with the sparkling wines he strove, Delusion on my sense to pour, And give an added warmth to love, Which glow'd, alas! too warm before! And then he spoke such gentle things! Such gentle kisses gently stole, As, thrilling, touch'd the tenderest springs, That quiver'd in my secret soul!— Pray'rs, flatt'ry, oaths, united, strove To warp the honor in my heart; And lest the grand deceiver, Love, Shou'd fail to tempt with every art, His tuneful pipe he lastly takes, And breaths such sweet, such melting strains, That every raptur'd sense awakes, To warmer wishes, softer pains! But reason now;—too long entranc'd! Flash'd with one bright, one parting ray:— “The night, I cried, is far advanc'd; “I cannot, will not longer stay!” “My lovely Harriet, think again!— “Why, gentle charmer, shou'd we part? “Why shou'd'st thou give a needless pain, “To a fond lover's faithful heart?” “Not part!—unhand me, cruel youth, “What doth thy wanton soul intend? “Wou'd all thy boasted love, and truth, “To seal my ruin, only, bend?” “No! not thy ruin, dearest maid! “They'd sweetly seal our mutual love;— “Why shou'd my Harriet be afraid, “The precious moments to improve?— “To-night, is only in our will; “To night!—perhaps this single hour; “Then dream not pleasures, death may spill, “But snatch a bliss beyond his pow'r.”— “Vitue forbid!—I am betray'd! “Dishonest youth, thy vicious love “In vain wou'd tempt a hapless maid “To joys, unhallow'd from above.— “Alas! within the sacred fane, “I fondly hop'd to be thy wife, “But all such flattering hopes were vain! “And I am fix'd a wretch for life!” “Forbear, too timorous maid! forbear “To torture me with words like these! “My life's best blood I'd freely spare, “To give thy gentle bosom peace. “Are not our hearts—by love entwin'd,— “Already to each other given? “And are not those, whom he hath join'd, “United in the eye of heaven? “Of ceremonies made by man, “The cause of strife, shall God approve, “And interdict the blissful plan, “Contriv'd by nature and by love? “'Tis nonsense all! th'immortal part “Disdains the force of human ties: “Then why shou'd those at shadows start, “Whom youth with joy's full cup supplies?”— He said,—and clasp'd me to his breast, With such a tender, ardent look, That all my soul was sore distrest, And all my frame with terror shook:— Yet weak, disorder'd as I was, I burst from his encircling arms, And with averted, burning face, And bosom beating with alarms, Invok'd his pity, and his love, To spare a helpless orphan's fame, And call'd on all the pow'rs above, To save me from reproach, and shame! The base betrayer's winning air How shall my feeble language speak, While seemingly, a generous tear Roll'd gently down his glowing cheek! But, ah! the flattering words he tried To overcome my struggling heart, 'Till life and reason are denied, Can never from my memory part! Attend all ye, who warning need, To the sweet syren's soothing song! What, tho' it make my bosom bleed, And you may scoff, and think it long, Yet, when a charmer ye shall hear, Who flatters with resembling arts, Shou'd the remembrance guard your ear, And fortify your tender hearts, My labour shall be well repaid! 'Twas thus the dear deluder spoke, As unto heav'n appeal I made, And from his wanton bosom broke.— “Can tender friendship, gentle love, “E'er be displeasing in his sight, “Who, by affection, links above “The spirits of eternal light? “Or, can the rites of wedlock prove, “With ties unhallow'd, as unblest, “A charm to bind, where ardent love “Warms not with mutual flames the breast? “When love is fetter'd, all is fire, “And tender passion soon decays; “Like those sweet birds which soon expire, “When we wou'd force their tuneful lays: “But free, from year to year, the grove “Seems living with their melting song; “So, generous, pure, and free-born love, “When unconstrain'd, lives only long.— “Be kind to all the sons of men, “Nor fraud, nor violence employ, “To give another's bosom pain, “Or interrupt another's joy; “Be courteous, humble, grateful, just, “Be quick to wipe the eye of care; “No vengeance seek, betray no trust, “The wrong'd redress, the erring spare; “This, be our creed, and if we live “According to its golden rules, “Need we against our reason strive, “To win the praise of rigid fools? “Ah! cease, my lovely Harriet, cease, “To value ties that cannot bind! “Let thy suspicions be at peace, “And give thy terrors to the wind! “Lock'd in each others fond embrace, “The dearest transport we will know “That bounteous providence, in grace, “Hath granted unto man below.— “Thus blest, and blessing, we will dwell, “Receive, and yield, a mutual joy, “In goodness, as in love excel, “And pleasures quaff, that never cloy.— “From our calm bosoms the fierce war “Of stormy passions far shall move; “Content and truth shall harbour there, “And constancy sit crown'd with love.— “Tell me, ye prudes, ye wise ones tell, “Who cant of virtue by the hour, “In what will yours, our lives excel, “Your lives, so cold, severe, and sour? “Is it not here the wisest way, “To catch the pleasures while they flow, “To bask in youth's sunshiny day, “Nor when 'tis offer'd, bliss forego?— “Yet, shou'd'st thou bondage still approve, “Let but thy charms this night be mine, “And on the morn,—I swear by love!— “The holy priest our hands shall join.”— In words like these, the artful youth His specious rhetoric did employ, To tempt my easy heart from truth, And win me to a guilty joy.— Alas! a subtle foe within, Made all his wiles too potent prove! Reason the painted snare had seen, But reason blinded was by love.— Ah! why upon the fatal theme That stamp'd my misery, shou'd I dwell? My guilt, my folly, and my shame, Are but already seen too well! The place, the hour, the wine, my heart, All, all conspir'd to make me fall A victim to a villain's art, And bring me to a bitter thrall! But waken'd from the fatal trance That murder'd all my peace, and fame, Horror and anguish stern advance, And, dreadful! paint my guilt and shame. At once his falshood, and my wrong, To my distracted sense arose, And with them brought a train along Of future wiles, and future woes.— In vain he tried each soothing art To lull my agonies to rest! For sharply pointed was the dart His hand had buried in my breast! “Base, barbarous man! I sobbing said, “If thou wou'd'st save my wretched life, “Let honor's dictates be obey'd, “And make me yet thy grateful wife! “But ever blasted honor, now, “Too well I know to weep is vain: “The gather'd flow'r no more shall grow, “Tho' water'd with a sea of rain! “Unhappy parents! to your wrongs “Is added fresh a daughter's shame: “But only to her guilt belongs “The foul dishonour on your name!” With feigned sorrow, the false youth Strove to beguile me of my tears, And look'd all tenderness and truth, The while he swore my gloomy fears Were groundless, and abus'd his love, Which was, and ever shou'd be just, If kind and generous I wou'd prove, Nor thus his plighted faith distrust.— But a few weeks must glide away, With much reluctance, he confest, Before we saw the happy day Which joining, shou'd confirm us blest.— This made his fond impatient heart So earnest to possess my charms, Lest cruel chance, or treacherous art, Shou'd tear me from his longing arms.— In honor's, in religion's eye, Already I was held his wife: Nor wou'd he break the sacred tye, For all the offer'd pomps of life.— Alas, my weakness let me own, With penitence, and bitter tears! By wiles like these, again he won My soul to guilt, and lull'd my fears.— So, for the day mistaking night, The moth, her silken wings with pain Drags from the taper's treacherous light, Yet soon is lur'd, and burnt again.— Day after day, thus glided on, And still some new pretence was made To make me lie contented down, In infamy's polluted bed.— At length a cause, more dear than life! Hurried my heart with fresh alarms, And urg'd me, as his wedded wife, To sleep, henceforth, in Edward's arms.— “My dearest Edward!—soft I cried— “The solemn rites no more delay; “Make me thy grateful, happy bride; “Thou shalt not, canst not, say me nay! “Doth not my glowing cheek declare “The motive that inspires my tongue? “I know by that expressive air, “My Edward's guesses are not wrong. “Let not the precious pledge of love “Be tainted by the breath of fame! “O! I conjure by him above, “Preserve us, both, from lasting shame!” “Harriet—he answer'd—yet awhile, “I cannot sooth thy cares to peace, “And strive thy sorrows to beguile, “While sunder'd from thy dear embrace. “Our mutual interest calls me hence, “And long hath call'd, tho' passion made, “From day to day, some fond pretence, “To linger in this quiet shade.— “Be confident, the pledge of love, “Whose mention freshly tints thy face, “Urges a father to remove, “Whate'er may stain it with disgrace; “But present hope, and future joy, “Nor less our infant's good, than thine, “This hand, ill-fated! wou'd destroy, “Untimely, shou'd it fix thee mine.— “Yet, love, who chides me now away, “Shall lend his wings for my return, “And tender thought, the live long day, “Thy charms shall paint, thy absence mourn: “Soon shall thy kind, thy gentle breast, “Be freed from all these soft alarms, “And soon thy beauties peaceful rest “In a fond husband's faithful arms!” Month after month, with silent care, I, anxious, waited his return;— Yet still my wishes fruitless were, And still my heart was left to mourn.— At times, indeed, his flattering pen Wrote tales of fond, unalter'd love, And sweetly promis'd, that again His presence shou'd my cares remove: But to affection, such as mine, Cou'd Words a sovereign balm impart? O!—tho' the language was divine! It cou'd not heal a wounded heart. And lo! to aggravate the more, My secret anguish, shame, and dread, The precious burden which I bore, In sin begot, in sorrow bred;— The little hidden pledge of love, Threaten'd, untimely, to reveal, What, with such anxious pains I strove From prying scandal to conceal.— Alas! its coming tho', with cause, I dreaded to a world of tears, Yet, urg'd by nature's tender laws, To welcome it, a mother's cares Were busied many lonely hours: These her fond hands and heart employ, When love, in Edward's presence pours Upon her soul a tide of joy! “And art thou then return'd at last “To thy poor Harriet's faithful breast? “Wilt thou atone for sorrows past, “And shall my cares be hush'd to rest? “O! see, my dearest Edward! see, “What a fond mother has employ'd; “And what, when torn from love, and thee, “Her bosom has, alone, enjoy'd!”— “Be calm, my dear, he coldly said, “And hear, with patience, what I tell; “Forget the idle vows I made, “Be wise, and all shall yet be well.”— “Forget thy vows!—what words are these?— “O! never, never, but with life! “Wilt thou not then restore my peace, “By making me thy lawful wife?” “This whining cease:—It cannot be.”— “Cannot!—what evil shou'd withstand?”— “Because, by fate's supreme decree, “Another claims my wedded hand.”— I heard no more;—the vital blood Within my breast forgot to beat, And sighing out,—my God! my God! I sunk down, senseless, at his feet.— Ah! had I sunk to rise no more, What storms had I escap'd to come! But penitence, with heav'nly lore, Had, then, not call'd the wanderer home. Awak'd at last to deeper woes, These killing accents met my ear; “Why shou'd my Harriet discompose, “And make her soul a slave to care? “The wretched cant of prudes despise, “And leave regret to wrinkled time, “Nor with that neck, those lips, those eyes! “Pass by gay pleasure's blooming prime!— “Prudence, 'tis true, thy Edward's hand “Hath given to a wealthier wife; “But prudence cannot love command, “His better heart is thine for life— “Then dry these tears; no wife, I swear! “Thy image from my breast shall move: “Still shalt thou reign unrivall'd there, “And still shalt be the wife of love.” Ah! who has felt a sudden wound Inflicted by a poison'd dart? Yet, keener had my pain been found, Sharper the arrow in my heart. For once, my cheek indignant burn'd, “And hast thou known, dishonest youth, With scorn and anguish I return'd, “So little of poor Harriet's truth, “To think her nature cou'd descend “To such abandon'd ways as these; “Or that her soul cou'd vilely bend “And find from prostitution, peace? “When the sole pride of all her life, “To thy deep art was fondly given, “She thought herself thy wedded wife, “In the all“seeing eye of heaven: “And still thy happy wife she were, “If truth cou'd keep, or oaths cou'd bind; “But truth's a jest, and oaths are air, “To thy debauch'd, and perjur'd mind.— “Not all the splendors of the earth, “Had won my constant faith from thee, “Tho' thou, for wealth,—of little worth! “Has torn thy plighted troth from me.— “Yet—tho' thou hast undone a heart, “Whose only fault was too much love!— “May fell despair his rending dart “For ever from thy soul remove!— “May the new partner of thy bed, “As Harriet fond, and faithful prove, “And may thy alter'd heart be led “To bless her with a canstant love!— “Reply not! every art is vain “To lure me back to guilty joys:— “O! had I never heard thy strain, “More dangerous than the syren's voice! “Alien to innocence, and peace, “I had not known this cutting shame, “Nor sacrific'd to wantonness “The honor of a noble name.— “Farewell for ever! in some shade, “Remote from all the arts of man, “I'll haste to hide my wretched head, “And languish out life's little span.— “Thy hapless offspring, nurs'd in tears, “The sole companion there shall be “Of its poor mother's tender cares, “And solace of her misery.— “O! if a son, my tongue shall preach “The evils of seducing art; “And if a daughter, often teach “The sorrows of a yielding heart!” I ended here; nor need I tell The cruel, pitying sneers that hung Upon his lip, or poorly fell From the base spoiler's taunting tongue.— Without one tear, he saw me go A victim to relentless woe!— Without one accent that might claim Alliance to remorse, or shame!— The schoolboy, thus, whose cruel play, Hath robb'd some blackbird's downy nest, Unpitying sees her fly away, With deadly anguish in her breast, Loudly lamenting thro' the grove, The ruin of her hopes, and love.— But heaven's avenging phial, still, Reserv'd a few sad drops to spill, And soon its bitter dregs were shed Upon my poor devoted head.— The dreadful shocks my soul had tried, Nature's allotted hour denied; My hapless child untimely came, And rivetted its mother's shame; But scarcely usher'd to the light, It sunk again in endless night.— How I surviv'd this flood of woes, The God above us only knows! Alas! no needful aid was near In the sharp hour of woman's fear! No kind, no pitying hand, was by To help, in my extremity! No tender kin, no friends were found, Who joyfully assembled round, Mine, in my infant's form to trace, Or read in his, a father's face! Just risen, feebly, from the bed, Where sickness long had lain my head, I sought the scenes, where erst my youth, Carest for tenderness, and truth, With seeming friendship had been prest To many a kind, and noble breast.— But, ah! in vain I sought around! No kind, no soothing friends were found! The busy tongue of babbling fame Had publish'd, far and near, my shame, And, only at the bar of heaven, I found my faults wou'd be forgiven.— Yes,—one amidst the herd remain'd, Who still a steady love maintain'd; Whose generous soul, nor overborn By cruel pride, nor bitter scorn, Beheld my penitence sincere, And grac'd it with a pitying tear.— But vainly wou'd his cares impart A med'cine for a broken heart! To grief, and slow disease, a prey, I daily find my strength decay;— See, from my cheeks, the roses flown, And, in my eyes, the lustre gone; View my pale lips, and hear my breath, Catch, with the labouring throbs of death; Nor feel one wish, that art may save My life, from an untimely grave!— Nor marvel, ye who read my tale That poesy shou'd lend a gale At this dark hour of pain and care, To waft my accents to your ear! Nor disbelieve, because in verse My hapless fortunes I rehearse! Tho' through my lines some fancy flow, Sincere, and poignant is my woe.— Wont in my day to soar, and sing, With vacant heart, and wanton wing, Ev'n now, when all my pride is flown, And spirit, health, and peace are gone! Ev'n now, when penitence and shame Strike deep, and tear this feeble frame! Ev'n now, when life's best glimmering light Trembles towards eternal night, My hand essays its once lov'd art, And paints the sorrows of my heart.— Nor this, alone, my pen inspires; A better impulse wakes my fires! For who but knows that dance, and song, Allure the thoughtless, idle throng? Young, inexperienc'd, giddy, gay, Alive to all deceivers say; They never dream that flattering love The bane of all their joys may prove: Thus, madly, whirl'd in pleasure's round, And influenc'd less by sense, than sound, Wisdom, their hearts wou'd vainly pierce, But thro' the harmony of verse; At unawares, they sometimes feel The truths, which error's victims tell.— So healing flow'd, for Isarel's king, From the sweet harp's melodious string, When learning sought, in vain! to find A cure for his distemper'd mind:— And, haply, when my woes shall cease, And I shall lay me down in peace, When malice spares to hunt my fame, And Harriet's but an empty name, Haply! my tale may meet his eye, By whose perfidiousness I die.— Then, if his heart not beats with care, If keen compunction sting not there, If his bright eyes nor melt in tears, Nor pale his lovely cheek appears, If he not smite his breast in haste, Nor yearneth to recall the past, Guilt cannot be allied to shame, And conscience is a worthless name.— Yet, both severely wound, or why Doth Harriet blush, and droop, and die? And ye, dear maidens! for whose sakes, My hand this last weak effort makes, Think not my mournful story long, Nor scorn the moral of my song! Perhaps my poor forsaken heart, For ever on the brink to part From the sad theme of all its pains, Has fondly lengthen'd out its strains, And dwelt on scenes, with many a tear! At once to memory sad, and dear!— Yet grudge me not this last relief, While pouring out my my hoard of grief! For you I freely give it vent, It is my dying testament! For you, with my expiring breath, I sing, and weave this mournful wreath.— Scentless, and pale, as it appears, And fruitful but of sighs, and tears; Unlike their wreaths who sweetly sing By Helicon's inspiring spring; Yet if your faithful guard it prove, From cruel man, and treacherous love, Its sprays shall live, and shed perfume, When I am wither'd in the tomb.— And thou, to whose kind hand I trust This warning scroll, when I am dust; Thou, to whose generous breast I owe Whatever friendship cou'd bestow! Who, truly, acting on the plan Held out by God to erring man, When fortune, friends, and fame forsook, Didst on my woes with mercy look; Confirm my hopes, contrive my ease, And strive to bring me back to peace; Do thou accept my thanks, and pray'rs, For all thy love, and all thy cares! When stretch'd in death's embrace I lie, And clos'd for ever! is mine eye; Upon my pale, and clay-cold breast, Which oft' the lovely substance prest! His lively image shall be found, Who gave that breast its mortal wound. Do thou restore it to his hand, And, O! thy burning heart command, The while thou tellest, that in death, I blest him with my latest breath, Pray'd for his peace, and begg'd of heaven, That all his sins might be forgiven:— I know thy soul; and shou'd his eye, Even then, one pitying drop deny To her sad fate, whose warmest blood Had freely flow'd to do him good, Restrain thy rage, nor blot thy name, By seeking to revenge my fame.— Assume not thou the chast'ning rod, But leave him, leave him to his God! Perhaps the healing hour may come, When he may mourn upon my tomb, Pour out his soul in tears, and sighs, And with his loud repentant cries, Wake heav'n to medicine his pain, And take him to its love again!— O! may my voice have pow'r to save, When crying to him from the grave! Then shall we meet where spirits move, In endless peace, and endless love! Where groveling passions fade away In virtue's glorious blaze of day! Where perfect charity extends, And all are angels, all are friends! Forgot our earthly coils, and cares, And dried eternally our tears, There praise shall every note employ, And all be harmony, and joy.— THE END.</field>
