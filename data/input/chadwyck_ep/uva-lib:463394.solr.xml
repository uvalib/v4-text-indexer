M. V. F. FINIS. THE HISTORIE OF IVDITH IN FORME OF A POEME. THE SOMMARIE OF THE I. BOOK. Holophemes Lieutenant generall and cheif of the army of Nebuchadnezer King of the Assirians was in the feild for to subdewe diuers people &amp; amongst others the Iewes. All the Nation is seazed with great feare, for the cruelties committed by the enemye. Then as it falles out in bruits of warre, all the whole people were troubled. Some sauing themselues in corners for feare, others attending in great perplexitie, som sad and Tragicall end the best sort calles upon God. This whyle Ioachim the chefe Priest gouerned the people: he by his letters &amp; expres commandement recalles those that wer fled and scattered, and made them returne to Ierusalem wher, in presence of the Leuits, he made sacrifice &amp; ernest preyer unto God to withdrawe his yre and to be mercyfull to his people, which done he enters in counsell and requyres his Prince to consulte upon the cause, and consider what is most expedient, and to prefer the loue of Gods Lawe and the countrie, before all priuate things: the first that gainstands this exhortatio is an hypocrite &amp; fauourer of the enemye, who giues counsell to render them to Holophernes calling him a Prince gratious to those that applaudes to him &amp; inuincible in battell to those that dar resist him. But the secound Lord replying zealously againe detecteth his fals hypocrisie and cairlies securitie, exposing the people to the mercy of a barbarous godles enemy before the duety they ought to their God and their countrye: and to establish in place of the true God, a wicked Nemrod consummat in all impietie &amp; wickednes, to abolish all uertue &amp; godlynes, for he proues that if the nation should be roted out for the right religion, God should be more honnored in the death of the Iewes then in their lyues: and that it is more worhty to dye Hebrewes than to lyue infidells. And freemen, the slaues. Shortly that they ought to preferre honour and dewtie before feare, and a uaine hope to prolong their dolefull daies. This reply encouraged all the assistants wherof Ioachim gaue thanks to God, and resoluing him selfe upon a iust defence for the conseruation of the seruice of God, and the fredome of his nation: and the lyues of the innocent against this vilanous inuasion: wysley departed the regiments of townes to persones conuenient who past to their assigned places, echone preparing according to their power unto the war with courage, paine, and diligence. THE FIRST BOOKE OF IVDITH. I sing the vertues of a valiant Dame, Proposition and somme of this work. Who in defence of Iacob ouercame: Th' Assyrian Prince, and slew that Pagan stout, Who had beset Bethulia walles about. O thou, who kept thine Izak from the thrall Inuocati? of the true God. Of Infideles, and stelde the courage small, Of feeble Iudith, with a manly strength: VVith sacred furie fill my hart at length. And with thy Holy sprite, my sprite enspire, For matter so deuine, Lord I require No humaine stile, but that the Reader may, Great profit reape, I ioye, thou praise alway. And since in vulgar verse I prease to sing, Dedicati? of the Authour altred by the translatour. This godly Poœme to a Christian King, To him who God in goodnesse hath erect For princely Piller, to his owne elect: For lawfull Lord, to raigne with trueth and right: For loue some Laurer, to the verteous wight: Him (I beseech) this trauel to defend, That to his pleasure I the same may end. When Izrell was in quiet rest and peace, And fruitfully the ground gaue her encrease, VVhich seauentie yeare vntilled lay beforne And nothing bare but thistle, weede, and thorne. It pleased God (vpon his iust correction) T'awake his owne, that were of his election, Least that the l?gsom peace should th? withhold: And dull their spirites, as doth the warriour bolde, Who spoils his horse with pampring in the stable, That makes him for the manaige more vnable. He spred their land with bands of enmies stout, VVhose cloudes of shot, be dimd their land about. The Armie of Holophern.Their Hoste, with arrows, pikes, and st?dards, stood As bristel pointed, as a thornie wood. Their multitude of men, the riuers dride, VVhich throw the wealthy Iuda sweete did slide: So that flood Iordane finding drye his banke, for shame he blusht, and down his head he shr?ke, For woe that he his credit could not keepe, To send one waue, for tribute to the deepe. Scarse had the Haruest m? with hooke in hand, Dispoilde the fruite and let the stuble stand: Scarse had the hungrie Gleaner put in bind, The scattred graine, the Sherer left behind: And scarse the flapping flaile began to thresh VVhen vnto Iacob, newes was brought a fresh. That Holophern, his frontiers did inuade, And past all Riuers, straites, and murders made So vile, that none he left that drew the breath: But olde and young, he put to sodaine death: The sucking babes vpon their mothers knee: His cruell cutthroates made them all to dee. Then like a flocke of sheepe that doth beholde, A wolfe come from the wood vpon their fold, Shapes no defence, but runnes athwart the landes, And shortly makes of one, a hundreth bands, So Isacks sonnes, in dreading for to feele The Hebreus. This tyrant, who pursued them at the heele, Dissundring fled, and sought their liues to saue: In hils, and dales, and euerie desert caue. The sheepherd of his flocke had now no care: Feare of the enimie. But fearing death fled to some mountaine bare. The Craftsman now his lumes away hath laide: The Marchant left his traffike and his trade, To hide himselfe more safely in a vault: Then in a Rampier, to sustaine th' assault. The Lords esteemde them selfes in surer holde: In Dennes of beasts, then castles gilt with golde. Feare lent the wings for aged folke to flie, And made them mount to places that were hie. Feare made the wofull wemen for to beare, Their cradles sweete to hilles that highest weare: Feare made the wofull child to waile and weep, For want of speede, on foote and hand to creep: Al where was nothing hard but hideous cryes, And pittious plaints that did the harts agryes. Affiction causeth prayer O Lord (said they) wilt thou still day by day, The arrowes of thine anger neuer stay? Wilt thou that Calde conquer vs againe? Shall Iuda yet the Heathen yoke sustaine? wilt thou againe that they make euerie towne, But stonie heapes of houses casten downe? Againe shall sacrilegious fire deuore, thy holy house where we do thee adore? Then Ioachim the priest of God most hie, who ouer Iuda then had chiefe degrie: Stood like a Pylot stout in tempest great, who seeing wind and weather for to threat, Yet to his mates, his feare, no terrour drawes, Nor leaues his ship vnto the wrackfull wawes. But with disguising feare, his face vp casts, And stoutly doth gainstand the balefull blasts: Right so this prudent prelate sent in haste, two hundreth men to passe where men were plaste In places strong, and thence commanded them, For to repaire vnto Ierusalem. Now since th' Eternall did reueale his will, Vpon the sacred top of Syna Hill, the Arke of God which wisedome more did holde, In Tables two, then all the Grekes haue tolde. And more then euer Rome could comprehend, In huge of learned bookes that they pend: Long wandred it throw tribs, throw kin and kin, Sam. 1.4. Sam. 2.6.and found no certaine place of resting in. Yea sometime it the shamefull spoile hath beene to sacrilegious hands of Palestene, vntill that time, that Iessies holie race, for euer lodged it in Iebus place. IerusalemBut for that Dauids h?ds with blood were filde throu infinits of humaines he had kilde. the king of peace would haue a king of rest, to build his Temple farre aboue the best: Sam. 2.7. His house, whose front vpreard so high and eavne, that lightlied earth, &amp; seemd to threat the heavne vntill that wicked time a tyrant vile, Of name and deede that bare the semble stile, Nabuchadnezer. Chr. 2.036. that did this king, that building braue he wract, And to the sacred ground al whole it sackt. Yet when, long after, Abrahms holie race, Of Tiger bankes had left the captiue place, Esd. 6. with combers great they redefied with paine, that most renowmed house of God againe. Which though vnto the first it seemde as small, As to a Princes house, a sheepherds hall, And though the hugenes were not as it was: yet sure the height and beutie did surpas, And ouerseilde the famous worke of Pharie: Ephesus temple, and the tombe of Carie. The Rhodian Collos, and the Caldean wall, that Semirame set vp with tourrets tall. Also the wondrous worke of this same temple, Might serue a Cresiphon for his exemple: Lysippus eke to carue by square and line, Or guide Appolles pensile most deuine. Heare in this place, all Izrel most deuoute, withdrew them selues to Salem round aboute, Ierusalem As when the heavne his sluces opens wide, And makes the floods vpon the ground to glide, the brookes that breakes adoune from diuers hils with course impetious till one deepe distils. Amongst the Dames, that there deuoutest were The Holy Iudith, fairest did appere: Like Phœbus that aboue the starres doth shine: It seemd that shee was made on moulde deuine. This Primate then assisted with his kinne Of great Eleazar (priests whose head and chinne, Was neuer shaue) deuoutly on he preast: A pearled Myter on his balmed creast. And with a holy Alb, with garnettes spred, And golden Belles, his sacred bodie cled. And slew, and burnt, the bulks (as was the guise) Of many a kid, and calfe for sacrifise. And with their blood, the Alters hornes he dyed, And praying thus, to God immortall cryed. Prayer.“O Lord of Hostes, we come not vnto thee, “To wey our merits with thy maiestie: “Nor to protest before thy heauenly might, “That sacklessy, thy scourge doth on vs light: “But rather we confesse (as true it is) “Our sinnes, haue iustly merite more then this. “But Lord if thou thy couenant would forget, “VVhich thou with Abrahm made, &amp; so wilt set “For mercie great, thy iustice most seueare, “Thou should a greater plague vpon vs reare. “Change then our proces from thy iustice seate, “And saue vs at thy throne of mercie great. “Forgiue vs Lord and holde farre from vs all, “These plagues, that on our heads are like to fall. Alas what helpeth vs thy heauie stroke, To binde our necks to such a seruile yoke, VVherewith th' Assyrian tyr?ts long haue grieued Thine Izak, till their bondage thou relieued. If so this natiue ground that new is tilde, If so these Hostries new with folke refilde: If so (alas) our chast and modest Dames, Our infants young, our Virgins good of fames, Should be a praye to Ammon, and to Perse, To Calde, and the mutine Parthian fierse, If that we see this Alter made prophane, And witches it abuse with Idols vaine: Yet, Lord if thou no pittie on vs take, At least great God, do for thy glories sake. Haue pittie on this holy building nowe, Where not a God hath sacrifice but thou: VVhere not a God but thou hast residence, To feile the sauour sweete of frankensence. Hold back (O Lord) the Caldean cressets bright From these rich Cedar vaults of stately hight. Preserue these vessels, ornaments of gold, From sacrilegious hands of neighbours bolde. And let the blood of beasts before thy face, Thy Iustice stay, and grant thy seruants grace. This prayer done, the people went their way, Then Ioachim conuende that present day: the Princes all of Iuda, and them praide, gainst this mischiefe for counsell, and thus said. Companions, if your former zeale remaine, Exhortation. If ardent loue to god ye still retaine: If wife, or childe, may cause your care or loue, VVhich should the Centers of your senses moue: If in your brests a noble hart doth bide, Let deede beare witnes at this wofull tide. For sauing God and your foresight, in deede t'is done, t'is done with vs, and all our seede. And after this, th' Immortall shall not see this alter fume before his maiestee. Comparison.VVh? th' Air is calme, &amp; still as dead &amp; deafe, And vnder heavne quakes not an aspin leafe, VVhen Seas are calme, and thousand vessels fleete Vp? the sleeping seas with passage sweete. And when the variant wind is still and lowne, the cunning Pylot neuer can be knowne. But wh? the cruell storme doth threat the bark, to drowne in deepes of pits infernall dark, while tossing teares both ruther mast &amp; saile, While mounting seemes the Azur skye to skaile: while driues perforce vpon some deadly shore, there is the Pylot knowne and not before. Alas I pray you then what care and strifes, Haue we to keepe our honours, goods, and lifes: Forget not then the care of this same place, your countreyes weale, gods glorie and his grace: But humblie giue your selues into the hand Of god most high, and with a holy brand, ‘repurge your sprits from euerie hatefull sinne, ‘which causeth God his Iustice to begin: And see what may to God be agreable, For Iacobs weale, and for you profitable. This said: an ancient traitour from his youth, who fostred gall in hart, with hony in mouth, Enforcing from his eyes some fained teare, (to cloke his malice) spacke as ye shall heare, My toung me failes, my hair for dread vpstarts, The Oration of a subtill worldling My heauie spirite, from pensiue corps departs. VVhen I bethinke me of yone tyrant stout, who hath bedround the world with bloud about: Approching threats our townes with firie flames, Our selfs with death, dishonour to our Dames. Yet when I call to minde the curtsie great, That this great Lord doth vse, who doth entreate Not onely those that beastiall are become, And haue their hope in brutall Idols dome, But euen to zealous folke who do embrace, The faith, and law, like vs of Abrahms race: who being well aduisde, did humblie sue His pardon, and escapte his vengeance due, then thanke I God who sends vs such a foe, As plagues the proude, and lets the humble goe: For we assoone, shall vanquish him with teares, As will be long, to wrak him with our weares. Then whilest we may haue choice of either state of peace or warres, his fauour, or his hate. Let vs not follow (seeing skath at hand) the follie of our fathers, to gainstand. But rather let vs beare a lower saile, And serue his king as best for our a waile. But thinke not yet, that I this councell giue for craft, or warrant for my selfe to liue: For I haue els my dayes so nearly spent, that for to dye I could be well content. The Assyrian neede not in my brest to strike, His fethred Dart, nor yet his trembling pike: Yea if my youth to me should eft returne, And make my youthly bloode within me burne, So honour I my God, and contrey deare, that for to dye for them, I would not feare: As Sampson did, if so my death might yeld: The victorie of the Vizroy, and the field. But most (I feare) least we with curious zeale, Fight for the lawe, yet fight against her weale, Against our selfs, to bring so great a wracke: that proude, and cruell tyrants shall vs sacke, And grow in pride (suppressing Iudaes strength) For to contemne the glorie of God at length. For Israell being lost, who shall ensue, to render here to God deuotions due? what people sparsed on this earthly ball From Indian shoare to where the Sunne doth fall, Or from the Climate of the northren blast, Vnto that place where sommer aye doth last: Hath God elect, saue Israell for his owne Vpon this Hill to haue his glorie showne? At this: the valiant Cambris of renowne, with righteous rage grew pale and gan to frowne, And brake the silence with a vehement stile, His courage movde the Princes all the while. A zealous godly answere.Nay rather where I stand let ope the ground (Quod he) to swallowe me, in pit profound Yea, rather righteous heauen let firie blast, Light on my head that thou on Sodom cast, Eare I my malice cloke or ouersile, In giuing Izac such a councell vile. For if the Leader of this folke prophane Vpon our bodies onelie sought to raigne, Although that we haue dearely bought alwaye Our freedome from our first maternall daye (which dearer is then gold for to be kept) I would assent, the holie Church except, But since more pride this tyrants hart enroules to lay a greater burden on our soules: Who are the vassalles of that onely King, That th?der sends &amp; Scepters down doth thring: ‘Should we forget him who made vs of nought, ‘More th? al w?drous things that he hath wroght who treates and loues vs like our father and king, Still vnder shadowes of his wondrous wing? Will he that we receaue a Prince ambitious? for God, a gods contemner Nemrode vitious? whose beastly life is of so vile a fame, That of a man he merits not the name? Goe to, goe to, let men, for men assaye with sword and shot, to deale it as we may: The victorie lyes not in mortall hands, Nor barded horse, nor force of armed bands. these are but seconde instruments of God, VVho, as him list, may send them euen or od. But if our soueraigne God willes such anoye, that folke vncircumsisde, our land distroye, Because we him offend while we haue breath, Alas, yet honour, honour him in death. And if we lose, and all be ouercome, Let patience winne the glorie of martyrdome. Forsooth, though Assurs soldiers braue &amp; bold Extinguish quite the race of Izak old, yet shall they not deface the liuing lorde, As these Apostats falsly doe afforde. For he, who peopled first this world so round, But with one man, from whome the rest abound And who long after, in an arke of woode Repaird the waste, made by the genrall floode: May he not eke transforme the hardned stone, To people who will honour him alone? And may not he do now, as he hath donne, who gaue to Abrahms barren wife a sonne? Them giuing Children moe, then in the heauen Are starrie Circles, light as firie leauen, And mo, then Northr? winds that driues the Rack Of Cyrene sands in number can compack VVho will obserue his law a hundreth fold More zealously then wee, who should it holde. ‘Then, fathers chose you warres, for better tels, ‘To lose like Iewes, then winne like infidels: ‘Let not the greede of gaine your harts attame, ‘to leaue the right, preferre not, feare to shame. Scarse ended was th' Oration of this Lord, when all the Princes with a sound accorde: By worde and deed confirmde his good aduise: The chiefe Priest gladdest of this enterprise, Vnto the heauen held vp his handes and face, And said, I thanke the lord who of his grace ‘Conioynes no lesse our wils, th? bolds our harts, ‘A sure presage that God is on our parts. This done, vnto his princes he deuides The tribes and townes &amp; ordaines them for guides for feare least some of them led with ambition In Izrell might stirre vp some new sedition, So they withdrew, and stoutly did prouide this furious storme of Mars for to abide. Then as ye see somtime the honie bees, Exerse themselfs on buddes of sweetest trees, Comparison. where they sometime assault the buzzing waspe, That comes to neare their flowrs away to claspe, Or when they hony drawe from smelling time, Or from the palme, or Roses of the prime: And how they draw their wax with w?drous art, Obseruing iointure iust in euerie part, Both vp and downe they build t? thousand shops, with equall space fulfilde vp to the tops: Or where the maister Bee, of thousand bands, Conducts the rest in legions throw the lands: who dayly keeps within their Cities wall: Their house, their work, their lawes and maners all. So thus the sonnes of Iacob plyde their paine: with hote desire their quarrell to sustaine. Some built the breaches of their brok? towne, Preparations of defence. that Heauen, and Panim yre, had casten downe. Some other found a cautell gainst the Ramme, to saue the wall vnbroken where it camme. Thus Iacobs townes on alsides had their flankes, with Gabions str?g with bulwarks &amp; with banks. Some others busy went and came in routs To terrace towers, some vnder baskets louts: Some others also wanting time and might, to strength their towns, yet vsde all kind of slight, To dig vp ditches deepe for cisterns good, To draw to them the best and nearest flood. VVhile th' Armorers with h?mers hard &amp; great On studies strong the sturdie steele doth beate, And makes thereof a corpslet or a iacke, Sometime a helme, sometime a mace doeth make, whiles sheepherds they enarme vnusde to danger whiles simple birds, &amp; whiles the w?dring str?ger. The tilling Culter then a speare was made, the crooked Sith became an euened blade: the people foode forgetes, no ease they take. Some on a horse, some on his proper backe, Some on a Cart, some on a Cammell beares, Corne, wine, and flesh, to serue for many yeares, Comparison.As done these Emets, that in sommer tide, Comes out in swarmes their houses to prouide: In Haruest time (their toyle may best be seene In paths where they their cariage bring betwene) their youth they send to gather in the store, There sick and old at home do keepe the skore, And ouer grainels great they take the charge, Oft turning corne within a chamber large (when it is dight) least it do sproute or seede, Or come againe, or weeules in it breede. FINIS. THE SECOND BOOKE OF Ivdith. THE SOMMARIE OF THE II. BOOKE. We haue hard before, how the people of God vsed al diligence to maintaine the libertie of Gods true religion and their Countrey. Now is set forth the extreame pride of Holophernes, who thought with one worde to ouerthrow them all. But to make himselfe some pastime, he assembleth his counsell to vnderstand of them what people they were, that inhabited the mountained in the Frontieres of Iudea, that durst make him resistance. Vpon this he is informed by the mouth of one of his chiefe Captaines of that, which hee looked not for: to witte, a discours of the Historie of the Iewes, from the time of Abrahams comming out of Caldea, to enter in soile Lande of promise vnto their deliuerance from the captiuitie of Babylon, following the order of the times quotedly the holie Scriptures with the praises of the prouidence of the almightie God, in defending of his Church, and a sharpe threatning to those that dare presume to disquiet the fame The chiefe Consellors of the Heathen hearing this, became more cruell, ensencing their Generall to murder this Captaine. But Holopherne with vaine ambition deferreth then bloodie request, and after that he had outraged him in words, be further blasphemeth the liuing Lord. And lastly caused him to rebound hand and foote, and to caried neare to the Citie of Bethulia, where he is by the besieged Souldiers brought into the Citie, and there declareth his case, exhorting them to continue constant to God, and their Countrey, and promiseth his assistance to his liues end. Now Holophern in Scythique Rampier stood, with st?dards pight of youthly heath? blood: Of nothing thinking lesse, then warre and fight, But in deuising pastime day and night: till he was war, that Iacob would aduance, Against his Panim force and arrogance. A packe of what? a packe of countrey clownes (Quod Holophern) that them to battell bownes, with beggers, bolts, and Leuers, to arrest My warriours strong with whome I haue supprest Both Tigris swift, &amp; faire Euphrates streame, People of Asia.with frosty Taurus and rocke Niphatheame. Are they not wrackt? ye cheefs of Moabits, And valiant Ephrem, ye strong Ammonits: ye that as neighbours knowes this folke of olde, That scattred thus, doe all these mountaines hold: Tell me what men are they, of what ofspring what is their force, their customes and their king? ‘For wise is he that wots with whome hee playes, ‘And halfe is victor as the Prouerbe sayes. The Lord of Ammon then, with reurence due, Right wisely spack the Duke, and yet, for true, He was a Panim both of faith, and kinde: But so (with fained toung) hee spake his minde: And all the Hebreus acts discourst so well, That Esdr' and Moyses seemde in him to dwell, Nomb. 23As did that sprite that made the Prophete blesse, the Isralits whome Balac did addresse, To curse them all, and wadge his couetous toung, which spake c?trarie that he would haue soung: So, please it you my Lord, I shall discrie, The storie of Izrell, yet so doing I, Am like the modest Bee, that takes but small Of euerie flowre, though she haue choice of all: For where she list the sweetest of she crops. A briefe discourse of th' estat of the Iewes.These people that ye see on mountaine tops, Encamped in these craggs, are of the line, Of Abraham, who (seruing God deuine, That mightie God of gods who create all, And firmely knit and built this mightie ball) Came to this land that then was tilde and sowne, Gen. 12. And by the name of wealthie Canaan knowne. VVhere onely God his wealth did multiplie, In goods, and siluer, gold, and familie. And when of age he was an hundreth yeare, His wife eke barren, neuer child did beare. God gaue them Izak, swearing that his seede, Should many Scepters rule and land bespreede. But when that holy Abraham was olde: And hoped well the promise made should holde, (O pitious case) Th' immortall voyce him spak: And bad him sacrifice his sonne Izak. Then like a ship betweene two winds beset, Gen. 32. Vpon the raging sea on both sides bet, In doubtsome feare, ne wots what way to keepe, Least one of them, confound her in the deepe: Makes close her ports, and slides on Neptuns back: At pleasure of the boisteous winds to wrack. So felt this Hebrew in his hart to fight, Both loue, and duetie, reason, faith and right. Nor wist he way to take, his troubled soule, From this to that, continually did roule, vntill the time, his heavnly feare and loue: His naturall earthlie pitie did remoue. Then hauing built the fire and all, anone His sonne he layd vpon the sacred stone, And with a trembling hand the cutlasse drewe, with heauied arme the stroke for to ensewe. When lo: th' Eternall staid the balefull knife, And downe it fell, &amp; spaird the guiltles life. Then God content to haue so great assaye, Of Abrahms faith: desended him alwaye. Of Izak, Iacob came, &amp; Iacob than, Of valiant sonnes had twelue in Canaan, Exod. 1.who (forst by famine) fled to Ægipt land, wherfore a while, there dwelling good they fand &amp; grew so great in nomber, that they were, a feare to those, that had them harbrowde there. And though th' Egyptians dayly them opprest, And burthens on their sweating backs were drest: Yet like the valiant Palme they did sustaine, Their peisant weight redressing vp againe, This movde King Pharo to command through all Great Nilus land, where raine doth neuer fall, He bad his folke should slay where so they came, All children males the seede of Abrahame, Assoone as they from mothers wombs were free, Their day of birth should be their day to dee. Exclamation.O cruell Tiger thinks thou that this deede Of Izak may cut of th' immortall seede? well may it stay the sucklings for to liue, &amp; kill th' accustomde frute that heavne doth giue: But spite of this, men Iacobs seede shall see In flouring state to rule all Cananee. The first of euerie house shall feele the hand And wrath of God against this law to stand. It fortunde Pharos daughter with her traine Of Ladies faire to play them on the plaine, Vpon the shoare where Gossan floode doth slide where after many pastimes they had tride, She hard an enfant weepe amongst the reedes, Then iudging it for one of Izaks seeds: As so it was, yet, with Paternall feare, Against his piteous plaint she closde her eare: But after vewing in that enfants face, I know not what of fauour and of grace, which did presage his greatnes to ensewe: Loue vanquist lawe, and pittie dread withdrewe: So from the floode not onely she him caught, But curiously she causde him to be taught: As her owne sonne, O sonne elect of God, That once shall rule the people with thy rod. Admiration. Thou haste not found a seruant for thy mother, But euen a Quene to nurse thee and none other. “Now see how God alwayes for his elect “Of wicked things can draw a good effect Note. “his prouidence hath made a wicked thing “Vnto his owne great profit for to bring. “VVhen Iosephs brether sold him like a slaue, Gen. 41. “He after came a kingly place to haue. “Of Haman proude the darke enuious hate. “brought Mardoche the iust to great estate. Est. “for where his enmie sought his shamefull end “the same vnto the worker he did send. This Hebrew Moyses once as he did keepe On Horeb mount his father Iethro his sheepe: Father in Law. He saw a fearefull sight, a flaming fire: Enclose a thornie bush whole and entire From whence a mightie voyce vnto him spake, which made the gro?d betwene the Poles to shake Exod. 3. I am that one, is, was, and ay shall bee, who creat all of nought, as pleaseth mee, I can destroye, I am the great, and Iust, the faire, the good, the Holie one to trust: whose str?g right h?d this world hath set in frame, I am th' Almightie God of Abrahame. I plague my foes, and graunt my seruants grace, All those that knowledge me and all their race. Then follow thou my will, &amp; quickly go, From me, to that Prophane King Pharao, who holds the towrs of Memphis and the field, Of Nilus shore that rich encrease doth yeld. And bid him let my people freely go: But if with hardned hart, he will not so. Stretch out thy staffe for to confirme thy charge, And it shall turne into a Serpent large. And this he shortly did, the thing to proue. It quickned lo, and on the ground gan moue. (O Miracle) he saw without all faile, It grewe a Serpent fell with head and taile: which crangling crept, &amp; ranne from trod to trod In many a knot, till time th' Almightie God Commanded him the same for to retaine, which to the former shape returnde againe. Thus siling humain sight, it chaunged forme, One while a Rod, one while a creeping worme. Then armed with this staffe the lord him sent, The proude Idolatrous princes to torment. He in the name of God full oft did pray, the King, to let the Hebrews go their way, Vnto the desert, where he did deuise, To offer God a pleasant sacrifise. But Pharo closde his eare against the Lorde, And to his holie word would not accorde. Then God th' Eternall wrought by Moyses hand to approue his worde great wonders in that land. Exod. 4 For he not onely Riuers turnd to bloode, Exod. 7. But also all the heads of Nilus floode, (which wattreth wealthie Egypt with his sources) was turnd to blood amid their siluer courses: So that the king him selfe his life to feede was faine to vse such water for his neede. This Moyses made the froggs in millions creep, Exod. 8. From floods and ponds, &amp; scrall fr? ditches deep, who cled all Misraim with their filthie frie, Euen on the king, and all his familie. To young and old of either Sexe that while, Exod. 9. He sent a plague of scalding botches vile: So that the Memphits layd on beds to rest, with vncouth venim dayly were opprest, to Medciners, the medcine vailed not, So sore the poisond plague did vndercot. He also smote the forrests, herbs and gras, The flocks of sheepe and euerie beast that was: throw poison of th' infected ground so fell, The Morrain made them all to dye or swell: So that the shepherd by the riuer side, His flock hath rather dead then sicke espide. He, earthly dust, to lothly lice did change, And dimd the Ayre, with such a cloud so straunge Of flyes, grashoppers, hornets, clegs, &amp; clocks, Exod. 10.That day and night throw houses flew in flocks, that with incisions sharpe did sheare the skinnes, of Ægipt Panims throw their proudest ynnes. And when the heavne most quiet seemd &amp; fair, th' Eternall sent a tempest through the air, &amp; at (this Hebrews prayer) such a reare Of thunder fell, that brought them all in feare. Here lay a Bull that woodran while he brast, There lay the Keeper, brunt with thunder blast, And now the forrest high that hid the air, with many-a spreeding arme, is spoild and bair. So that the sap that grafters keeps with paine, which should restore the stock, and leafe againe: Is loste (alas) in lesse then half a daye, the husbands hoped fruite gone to decaye. VVhat more? th' Eternall darkned so the skye, For three dayes space none could another spye, that cloude so thick, the Memphis rebels fand, that they might firmly feele it with their hand, It seemd that Phœbus left his ancient round, And dwelt three dayes with men of vnderground. “And as the sunne at one selfe time is felt, “with heate to harden clay, and wax doth melt: “so Amrams sacred sonne in these proiects “made one selfe cause, haue two contrarie effects. “For Izak, humbly knew their Lord deuine, “But Pharo, more and more did still repine, “Like to the corpslet colde the more t'is bet “with hammers hard, more hardnes it doth get. Yet when his sonne was slaine by th' Angels h?d, Exod. 11 Amongst the eldest heires of Ægipt land: He was afraide, and let them go that night, Heyre where pleased them to serue their God of might: VVho sent a cloude before them all the day, By night a Piller of fire, to guide their way. But sodainly this tyrant did gainstand His former graunt, and armd all Ægipt land VVith hote pursute against all Iacobs hoste, that were encamped on the Red-sea coste. Such noyse was neuer since the foraigne tide, Brak throw Gibraltar, when it did deuide the Calp, from Abill, or when Sicill strand Deuorsed was from her Italia land: As was in these two campes that one with boste, that other with their waillings filde the coste: It seemd the sounds of furious horse and men, With hornes &amp; pypes to heavne resounded then. O Iugler, said the Iewes, what hatefull strife Exod. 14. They murmure. Hath moued thee to change our happie life. What are we fishes for to swimme the seas? Or are we foules to fly where as we pleas? Beyond the Sea, or ouer hills to soare? VVas there not graues for vs on Gossen shoare: But in this desart heare to dye or haue the bloodred Occean Sea, to be our graue. Then Moyses with his quickned rod that tide He smote the sea, which (fearefull) did deuide Discouering land that sunne had neuer seene, And staid the sea, as there two walles had beene: which made a passage dry of ample space, For all to passe who were of Isaks race. But contrarie the Red-sea did deuower, The barbrous tyrant with his mightie power, who proudly durst himself to that present, which opened but to saue the innocent. O happie race, since god doth arme for thee, Both fire and aire, the winds, the clouds and see, which all vnto thy paye haue whole enclinde, Let not c?suming time weare out of minde: So rare a grace, but let thine elders shewe this to their noble seed that shall ensewe: And let their sonnes, vnto their sonnes recorde Throw all the world rhese wonders of the lorde. God, with Cœlestiall breade (in time of neede) Exod. 16His loued Iacob fourtie yeare did feede: And gaue them water from the solide stone, which of it selfe, had neuer moisture none. Their caps, their cotes, &amp; shoes, that they did wear God kept all fresh and newe, full fourtie year. And farder, least their soules for want of food, Exod 20.should faint or faile: he of his mercies good Gaue them his law, pronounced by his voyce, His sprite to theirs, in him for to reioyce. So teaching them, and vs in precepts ten, Our duetie first to god, and next to men, To th' end that man to man should truely stand, And ioyne with God, and neuer break that band. This mightie Prophet dead: Duke Iosua than, Iosua Their Captaine stout this Palmy prouince wan: Throw might of God he Scepters did subdewe Of thirtie tyran kings, whome all he slew. At his commandment like the thunder sound, The Rampers strong fell fearefully to ground: Before the Tortuse, or the horned Ramme, Had bet, or mined, from their wall a dramme: For euen of hornes, full hoarse, their simple blast An engine was, their towres adoune to cast. He prayd the heavne for to prolong the daye, And made the horses of the sunne to staye, To th' ?d, the night should not with cloud be cled To saue the faithles, that before him fled. Now when this Panim scourge (with age at last) Had left this life, and vnto heauen past: Then Izak had of Rulers sundrie men, whose glorious acts deserues eternall pen. who knowes not Samgar, Barac, and Othoniell? Iudges. The valiant Delbor, Ahud, and good Samuell? What land (O Sampson) rings not thy renowne, who sole, vnarmed, bet an Army downe? what laude to Iephthe iustly might we lowe: Had he not hurt his owne, through hastie vowe? What hill or dale, what flood or fixed ground, Doth not the famous Gedeons praise resounde? In later time, their kings some good, some bad Of all the Hebrew state the ruling had. Had I the Harpe of Dauid (holy King) None other sound but Dauid would I sing, But euen as all the deeds that Dauid did, Could not be done by none, but by Dauid: So none but Dauid, on his yvrie harpe, The glorious praise of God could onely carpe. But here his praise, I prease not to proclame, Least I throw want of skill obscure the same. Salomon.Yet leaue I not his Sonne, whome grace deuine made no lesse rich, then wondrous of engine: whose doctrine drew to Salem from all wheare, A hundreth thousand wyzards him to heare: From Araby, from Ynde, to Affrik shore, His toung entysd them with his cunning lore. Iosiat.Shall I forget the kings who ouerthrew, Idolatrie and plaste religion dewe? Hezekiath. IerusalemShall I forget that King, who saw descend A winged Hoste Solyma to defend? Asa.Shall I forget him, who before his eene, Enchast the bands of Chus on Gerar greene? Iosephat.Shall I forget him, who preparing fight gainst Ammon, Seir, &amp; Moabs, Idoll might, Saw ech of their three hostes on others fall, And with them selfs their selfs, disconfit all? Yet, for their sinnes God gaue them in the h?ds Of Calde kings, who conquerd all their lands: And tooke king Zedekee, and made an end Of that Impyre, till God did Cyrus send, VVho set them free, and gaue them of his grace Two rulers of their owne. And now this place Is kept, by sacred Ioachim, whose powers consists not onely within Syons towers: But Edom, Sidon, Moab, and we all Do know his strength &amp; knowes him principall. Now Sir, ye hear the progresse first &amp; last Of Izaks race in order as it past. One while the Lord enha?st them to the skye: One while he drew them down in deeps to lye. ‘But were he Iudge, or Prince, or king of might, ‘Who reuld the Hebrews polycie aright, ‘VVhile they obserude thaliance made before, ‘by their forefathers who to God them swore ‘In happie state all others they surpast: ‘And vnderfoote their proudest foes were cast. ‘And all the world, that their destruction sought ‘Against their state, and name, preuailed nought. ‘But contrarie: as oft as they astraide ‘From god their guide, he on their shoulders laid: ‘The Barbare yock of Moab, &amp; oftymes ‘Of Palestine &amp; Ammon, for their crymes, ‘The heauie hand of God was seene to be, ‘On their ingratefull infidelitie. Now, if so be that any odious sinne, Prouoke their Lord his Iustice to beginne: Then myne not you their towres nor tourets tall, Nor bring the wracksom engine to their wall: Nor place thy battries braue, nor yet aduenter, with thy couragious camp the breacth to enter. For if Libanus mount or Carmell faire Or Niphathæi should parke them from repaire: If Ynde and Nilus with the Rhene and Rhone to close them round about, should runne in one. For their defence: yet shall they not withstand (With all their force) thy furious fighting hand. But if they haue not broke the band in deede That God with Abrahm made &amp; with his seede: Beware my Lorde, beware to touch or moue These people that the Lord so much doth loue. For though south Autan, would dispeople his l?ds, And bring the blackest Mores to swarme in b?ds: If Northren Boreas, vnder his banners colde, would bring to field his hideous Soldiers bolde: If Zyphirus from sweete Hesperia coste, would send his chosen armed men to Hoste: If Eurus, for to ayde thine enterprise, would bring his men fr? whence the sun doth rise: Yet all their numbres hudge, and forces strong, Can neuer do to Isrel any wrong, Nor hurt one hair if their great God say nay. That god will them defend because he may: with one small blast confound all kings that darre, (As thou doest now) prouoke him vnto warre. Then like as ye beholde the quiet see, Not raging when the winds engendring be: But blauncheth first, then growes in litle space, In wallowing wawes to flow with fomy face: And lastly beats the banks, and ships vnshrouds, with wrackfull waues vphoist to highest clouds: So, almost all the princes of that hoste, VVith inward anger gan to be emboste, As oft as they the praise of God did heare, So to his speech encreast their spitefull cheare: which in the end, to blasphemie them brought, Th' immortall God of gods to set at nought. Kill &amp; cut off (quoth they) this traitour fine, Whose subtill talke, with all his whole engine, Pretends to saue these Hebrews from our hands, And threts vs with vaine gods of forraine lands: For if it please you (noble prince) to send, But twentie men of value that are kend, VVithin your camp, these recklesse rebels then shalbe a pray to all your warlike men. (O wicked wight) but then the Vizroy stout, with powre, apeasde the murmur of the route: And to him said: O shameles Prophet thou, what Sybill or what charmer tell mee now?

Haue we an other God, or king of kings, then our great Persian Monark now that rigns? VVhose barded horse orerunns the Nations all, whose armed men, out of these mountains tall shall rake these Rebels that from Egypt came To this, where they vniustly keep the same?

But, foole, what speake I thus? no haste a while Thy blood (O villaine) shall not me defile. so iust a paine, so soone thou shalt not haue, for thy deceipt, so soone to go to graue. ‘For in a wretches sodaine death, at ones ‘Their longsome ill is buried with their bones.

If God be god as thou right now hast said, then of thy faith, giue witnesse vndismaid. A marshall of the camp then being prest who was not yet so cruell as the rest. There tooke this demy Pagan (Ammons lord) and sent him bound to Bethull (with a corde) Then euen as in his clawes the kite doth beare, the chirping chicken throu the weather cleare: while that the cakling hen below on ground, Bewailes her bird with vaine lamenting sound. So in like woe his worthie men were left, For that so worthie a chief was them bereft The townsmen th? beholding neare their wall These Miscreants, to armour straight they fall yclad in plate and maill &amp; runs in bandes, And fearsly fronts their foes with steele in hands as fast as done the riuers doune the hils, that with their murmur hudge the deepes vpfils. The Heathen seeing this retirde awaye, And left the Lord of Ammon for a pray to th' Hebrew soldiers who did him constraine, Though he was willing, with them to remaine. VVhen all the folke with prease about him past His eyes and hands vp to the pole he cast, ‘And thus he spak: O God that great abyds ‘vpon th' Immortall seate and iustly guyds ‘the ruled course of heavne, whose liuing spreete, ‘reuiuing spreds, &amp; through all things doth fleete: ‘I render thee, O God immortall praise, ‘for that before I end my wofull dayes ‘Now from th' unfrutefull stock thou doest me race ‘to graft me in thy frutefull tree of grace, ‘where in dispite of all c?trarie strife, ‘I shall bring forth the fruits of lasting life. And ye, O Iacobs sonnes, thinke not at all That I of purpose captiue am and thrall: So that I meane hereby your wrack to bring For God he knowes I thinke not such a thing. But I am captiue thus because I tolde, VVhat w?drous works the lord hath done of old, to you and your forefathers euer still, Delivring them that wold obey his will. Then doubt not you a thousand flaffing flags, Nor horrible cryes of hideous heathen hags: Coole not your harts, for if the world about, would compasse you withall their warriours stout (Prouyding first yee seeke your help at need At power deuine, and not at mortall seede) You surely shall see Mocmurs renning flood, Made red, with Assurs hoste and Ethnique blood: ye surely shall, see men not vsde to fight, Subdue their foes, that seemes of greater might. The hand of God assailes you not with hate, but for your weale your pride he will abate, To let you wit, it is within his power, To leaue or to relieue you euery hower. As on th' vnsavrie stocke the lillie is borne: And as the rose growes on the pricking thorne: So modest life with sobs of grieuous smart, And cryes deuout, comes from an humbled hart: For euen the faithfull flocke are like the ground, That for good frute, with weeds will still abound. If that the share and culter ydle lye, That ryues the soyle and roots the brambles bye: But in the end, God will his yre relent, Assoone as sinners truely will repent: And saue you from these plagues that present be In shorter time then ye do thinke to see. take courage friends, &amp; vanquish God with teares And after, we shall vanquish with our weares these enmies all. Now if there rest in me the former force that once was wont to be: If elde haue not decaid my courage bolde, That I haue had with great experience olde, I render me to serue you to my end: for Iacobs weale, Gods law for to defend. FINIS. THE THIRDE BOOKE OF Ivdith. THE SOMMARIE OF THE III. BOOKE. In this third booke the Poet settet'h forth the seege of Bethulia, and the extremitie that God permitted them to feele, thereby to giue an entrie to his miraculous deliuerance: who is accustomed to lead his people to the gates of death, and from thence to retyre them aboue all humaine expectation, to the end they should confesse that the arme of flesh, nor worldly wisedome mainteines not the Church: but the onelie fauour of the Almightie to whome the whole glorie of duetie should be rendred. Farder: thre principall things ar to be noted: First, the preparations of the beseegers, and the defences of the beseeged, and how after throw the councell giuen to Holopherne for the restraint of the water from the towne ensewes a furious assault, which the Iewes repelled with great paine: Secondly, the extreame desolation through want of water, whereof proceedeth sundrie sorts of death, with lamentations murmurations, and daunger of mutine within the Cittie, and how the Gouernour endeuoures himself with wise and godly admoniti?s to appease the same: But the commons in this hard estate regarding no reason, required to r?der the Citie, rahter th? to perish in such appar?t miserie. The Gouernour being caried with a humaine prudence promiseth to render the towne within fiue dayes, if God send them no succour. Yet such is the estate of gods church in this world, that when all things faileth, God manifesteth his power: And therefore in the third part is Iudith introduced, who (being especially moued by the reading of Holy Scriptures) is encouraged to deliuer her countrie: but when she vnderstoode the resolution of the Maiestrats, She (being in estimation honourable) modestly reproues them. After their excuse, she promiseth to attempt something for the publike weale: not showing her deuise, but onelie desired to haue passage by night vnto the enemies camp, and this is granted. Thhe Snoring snoute of restles Phlegon blewe, Hote on the Ynds, and did the daye renewe VVith skarlet skye, when Heathen men awooke At sound of drumme, then pike &amp; dart they tooke: In order marching, and to combat calles, th' vndaunted sonnes, within their Cities walles. The meeds in May with flowers are not so dect, of sundrie fauours, hewes, &amp; seere effect, As in this campe were people different farre In toungs &amp; maners, habits, tents, and warre. Yea Chaos old, whereof the world was founded, Of members more confuse, was not compounded: yet soundely they in vnion did accord, To wage the warre against th' Almightie Lord, who shaks the Poles, whose only breath doth beat Libanus mount, and makes Caucasus sweat. There came the Kettrinks wilde of colde Hircania: Ioynd with the men of great, and lesse Armania. VVith coppintanks: and there the Parthian tall, Assaid to shoot his shafts and flee withall. The Persians proud (th' Empyre was in their h?ds) with plates of gold, surbraued all their bands. The Medes declarde through fortunes ouerthwart they lost their Scepter, not for lacke of hart: And that no costly cloath nor rich aray, Nor painting fine, that on their face they lay nor borrowde hair, of fair &amp; comly length, might oght empair, their anci?t power &amp; str?gth: There were the happie Arabs those that buields In thatched waggons, wandring throu the fields. The subtill Tyrians, they who first were clarks, that staid the wandring words in leaues &amp; barks. The men of Moab, Edom, Ammon, and the People sparst on large Elimia land. The learned Memphians, &amp; the men that dwell Neare to the Æthiopians black &amp; fell. In short the most of Asia (as it wair) Encamped was within that army fair. So that this Duke mo forraine souldiers lad, then all the Hebrewes natiue people had. But they who did the Hebrewes greatest wrong were Apostats of Ephrem fearce &amp; strong: who fought with hatefull harts them to deface, Least they should be esteemde of Izaks race. Then, as in time of spring the water is warme, &amp; crowding frogs like fishes there doth swarme: But with the smallest stone that you can cast to stirre the streame, their crouping stayes as fast: So while Iudea was in ioyfull dayes, The constancie of them was worthie prayes: for that in euerie purpose ye should heare the praise of God, resounding euerie wheare. So, that like burning candles they did shine Among their faithfull flocke, like men deuine. But looke how soone they hard of Holopherne, their courage quailde &amp; they began to derne. Their ardent zeale with closed mouth they choke their zeale to hote returnd to fuming smoke: the feare of losse of life &amp; worldly good: brought Infidels to shed their brothers blood: Alas how many Ephramits haue we? In our vnhappy time all which we see within the Church like hypocrits to dwell, so long as by the same they prosper well: who feines a zeale, th' Euangill to maintaine So long as serues their honour, or their gaine. But turne the chance with some contrarie winde, So that their browes but half a blast doe finde, Then faints their harts, and they seeke other waye, Like bankers out their God they disobaye Discyphring then their malice to be more to gods contempt, then was their zeale before, And fights against the lord with greater hate, Then Celsus did, or Iulian Apostate. The Hebrewes, now from hights of houses faire VVho saw so many banners beate the aire: And men to march against their forces small, who now might well decerne their feeble wall: They swoune with feare, &amp; fand none other aid: but of that God, to whome their fathers praid. O father (quod they) father holie king, who shields vs alwayes vnderneath thy wing: Since now the worlde against vs doth conspire, Defende vs mightie Lord we thee require. Thus hauing humbly praid the Lord of might, the Gouernour renforst his watches wight: And fires at midnight built in euerie way, which made the night appeare as cleare as day: and wakerife through the corpsgard oft he past: And thought that Phœbe hyed her course to fast with horses paile to steale awaye the night, to leaue the Hebrewes to their enmies sight. Againe, the Pagan thought she did but creepe, Or that with Latmies sonne she was on sleepe. ‘But humaine wishes neuer hath the powre, ‘to haste or hold the course of heavne one howre. Then as Aurora rose with sanguine hewe, And our Horyzon did the day renewe: The Vizroy made a thousand trumpets sound, to drawe his scatred Cornets to a round, who from all parts with speede assembled weare About the Genrals tent his will to heare: As do the hounds about their hunt at morne Come gladishing at hearing of his horne. Now when the towne, his som?ds did disdaine to conquer it perforce he plyde his paine: And their, th' Inginers haue the Trepan drest, Engins of Warres &amp; reared vp the Ramme for batterie best: Here bends the Briccoll, while the cable cracks, their Crosbowes were vprent with yron Racks. Here croked Coruies, fleing bridges tall, Their scathfull Scorpions, that ruynes the wall. On euerie side they raise with iointure meete, the tymber towres for to command ech streete. The painefull Pioners, wrought against their will, with fleakes &amp; fagots, ditches vp to fill. Or vnderground they delue in dust with paine, to raise a mount, or make a mount a plaine. Or Cauerns cut, where they might soldiers hide, t'assaile the towne at sodaine vnespide. Some ladders drest to skale the wall, or els to steale vpon the sleeping Sentinels. Some vndermynes, some other vndertooke, to fire the gates, or smore the towne with smoke. The greatest part did yet in trenches lurke to see what harme their engins first would wurke, that if the wall were bet, they wold not faile with braue assault the Citie to assaile. There Mars to wremyner, there Bellona wood, Enforced feeble Cowards to suck blood. their hidious horses, braying loude and cleare, their Pagans fell with clamor huge to heare, made such a dinne as made the heavne resound, retented hell, &amp; tore the fixed ground. Yet God who keeps his watch aboue the skyes For his elect, who neuer ydle lyes: tooke pittie on his people in that tide, Repressing (part) this cruell princes pride In causing all the chiefes of Moabits, of Edom strong, &amp; awfull Ammonits to speake him thus, &amp; thus him terrours drest. O Prince, that Scepter beares aboue the rest, &amp; giues them law, &amp; holds the world in thrall, set not thy soldiers, to assault this wall: For neither bow, nor sling, nor weapons long, nor sword, nor buckler, wilbe found so strong: As is this threatning rock, whose mightie corse sustaines their wall, of such eternall forse, that thou can mak no skallade on no coste: But on the corpses dead, of half thine hoste. ‘The victor can no honour iustly clame ‘to lose the men who should aduance the same. ‘O valiant Prince, that fisher is not fine, ‘who for a frog will lose a golden lyne ‘the holy headband seemes not to attyre, ‘the head of him, who in his furious yre ‘preferrs the paine of those that haue him teend ‘before the health &amp; saftie of one freend. You may (my Lord) you may in litle fight, subdue these Roags, &amp; not to lose a knight. Surprise me first their chiefest water spring from whence these rebels do their conduits bring: Th? drought shal driue th? fr? their whole def?ce, In cords to yeld them to thine exellence. ‘The noble Lyon neuer sleas the least, ‘but alway prayes vpon some worthie beast. ‘The thunder throwes his sulphred shafts adowne ‘on Atlæas high or colde Riphes crowne. ‘The tempest fell more feruently doth fall, ‘on houses high, then on the homly hall. So you my Lord need not to prease your powre, Against such foes as will themselfs deuowre. Sir, this is not for fauour or for neede, Nor that this Citties sack may cause vs dreade. Nor that we meane thy high attempts to stay, For ere we from thy standarts stirre away, For thee, th' immortall gods we shall defie, For thee, we shall breake downe their alters hie: For thee, we frankly shall pursue &amp; thole, th' eternall heat &amp; colde of either Pole: For thee, our hardy hands shall help to teare From Ioue &amp; Neptune, both their Eagle &amp; speare: For thee, the sonne for father shall not care: Nor father sonne, nor brother, brother spare. Now, Holopherne to conquest whole enclynde And weing well this counsell in his minde: Dismissed from his camp a galliard rout Of men to guard the Riuers round about. This stratageme, the Hebrews well might know to see their fountaines runne with passage slowe. Then manfully their soldiers out they send, against their foes, the watter to defend. There fought the Pagan for to winne him fame, the Hebrew ment, hee would not dye with shame. Together soone, they shock with hatefull yre, And first, they forst the heathen to retyre: who (turning face) againe do them pursewe, &amp; wins the victorie from the victors newe. So doubtfull was the fight, none could define (Saue God) to whome the victrie would encline: till Izrell was on all sides ouercled with clouds of shot, then to their towne they fled, As doth the Pilgrim passing through the plaine, who is beset with tempest, haile, or raine, who leaues his way, and seekes himself to hide, within some caue, or hollow mountaine side. The Panims them pursued without all pittie, and Peslmell entred almost in the Cittie At open gate. Then rose the crye vnsweete Of fearefull folke who fled in euerie streete, And rent their haire &amp; their affrighted face as Panims els had wonne that holy place. How flee you cowards now &amp; leaues your Port? (the Captaine sayes) haue ye another fort? Thinke ye to finde for saftie of your crowne In this Bethulia another Bethull towne? (Alas) if ye make no defence at all, while time this tyrant is without your wall. How dare you him resist when he hath wunne this forte of yours from which ye feebly runne? The c?m?s with this chek, broght to their powers, where Cambris &amp; Sir Carmis like two towers, Stoode at th' assaulted gate &amp; did withstand the Heathen host with ech of them in hand An yron mace (in stead of launces long) &amp; brazen bucklers beating back the throng: Their habergions like stiddies stithe they baire with helmets high &amp; pennons pight in aire: Of equall age they were, &amp; equall length, Of equall courage, &amp; of equall strength: Like Poplers twaine that recheth vp their tops &amp; holds their heads so high that none th? crops: But on the Riuers side do sweetely sway Like germaine brether hailsing oft a day. The Heathen seing thus the Iewes descend with edge of sword their Citie to defend: They left th' assault, and thence retyring went (as they commanded were) vnto their tent. But when I thinke how xxx. dayes that towne, tormented was with mischiefe vp and downe. Too sad a song I cannot heare inuent So great a sadnesse right to represent. My hand for horrour shakes, &amp; now no more Can lead my sacred pen as erst before: For now mine eyes, that watred are with teares Declares my matter all of mischief beares. Oh Sprite from whence all sprit &amp; life doth c?me, thou losde the toung of Zacharie that was d?me. and sent thy Heralds through the world to preach thy name: And in a hundreth toungs to teach: Guide thou my pen &amp; courage to me lend, that to thy honour I this worke may end. Although that Izak sawe on euerie hand A world of folke against his towne to stand: yet (tracting time) he thought hee would prouide no lesse to keepe, then coole th' Assiegers pride. But when they fand the conduits cut and rent, By which, there water to their towne was sent: Their courage bolde, &amp; all their craks (alas) As lickour faild, so did their stoutnesse pas. Their Lords preferring death to bondage vile, Made them beleeue the thing did them beguile: To wit, they gaue men hope that they might keep sufficient watr'in wels, &amp; ceasterns deepe: Through all the towne, the people to relieue, That thirst should not the soldiers greatly grieue. The maiestrats in deed had great regard To see this water wisely spent and spard, that Bottell sweete, which serued at the first to keepe the life, but not to slocken thirst. A vine descripti? of thirst.When wels grew drye, the c?mons ran inrage &amp; sought out euerie sink their thrist t'asswage: And dr?k with l?gsom draught the pools in haste, to quench their thirst with ilcontented taste: which poysond ayre, enfect their purest breath: whereby the drinker drank his present death. O wretched folke, who felt so hard a strife, Drink, or not drink, both ways must lose their life. For he that drank, and he that did refraine, Had of their enmies both an equall paine. For why? the water vile slew them throughout, No lesse, then did their enmies them about. That wretched towne had neuer a strete nor rewe, But Parcas their, had found some facion newe. to murder men, or martyr them with feares, As movde the most indurate hart to teares: If so much water in their braines had beene, as might forbeare a drop to wete their eene. There plaind the oldman that the soldier strong, Had reft his Bottell from his head with wrong: But while he spak his hart (for thirst) did faint, And life him left which frustrate his complaint. The soldier braue, Oh hartbrek, for to tell his proper vryne dranke thrist to expell. The wofull mother with her spitle fed Her litle childe half dead in cradle bed. The Lady with her Lord at point of death, Embracing fals &amp; yelds their latest breath: ‘For cruell thirst came out of Cyren land ‘Where she was fostred on that burning sand, ‘with hote intracted toung, &amp; soncken eene, ‘with stomack worne, &amp; wrinkled visage keene, ‘with light &amp; meigre corse and pailed vaines, ‘in stead of blood that brimstone hote retaines: ‘Her poysond mouth blew throw that holy town, ‘such hellish ayre, that stifled vp &amp; down. The Arters of the Iewes in such a way, That noght was seene but burials night &amp; daye. So that the heavne, to see their dollours deepe, Could scarsly keep his course, but preasd to weep: And would haue ioind his teares to their c?plaint, if God of hosts had made them no restraint. Yea I my self must weepe, who cannot speake the woes, that makes my heauie hart to breake. And so will silent rest &amp; not reherse, But conterfait the painter (in my verse) who thought his coulours paile could not declare, the speciall woe, king Looke the table Agamemnon bare, when sacrificed was his onely race: with bend of black, he bound the fathers face. Now while the people were in this estate &amp; with their princes wrangling in debate, They thus besought the lord for to decide betweene their simplesse &amp; their princes pride. The lord be iudge of that which ye haue wrought &amp; what your wicked counsells hath vs brought. If you had offred peace to this great Lord At first, we might haue wonne him to accord. Then happie happie dayes we might haue seene, &amp; not so many souldiers murdred beene. Alas what hope haue we within this holde Our enmies are more meeke a thousand folde. Then are our owne: they, haps, would vs preserue, our wilfull owne, pretends to see vs sterue. Our children do our childrens weale denay, &amp; headlong hastes vnto their owne decay. VVe know, ô Lord, the breaking of thy lawe, hath caused thee this sword on vs to drawe &amp; iustly thou thine yrefull bow doest bend on our vnloyall heads the shot to send. But thou, who doth not long retaine thine yre, Against thine owne, thy mercie we require. Change thou the purpose of our foolish guides, &amp; of these Heathen, armed at our sides. Or els let vs vpon their weapons fall, &amp; of their hands to be distroyed all: Or we this drougth &amp; deadly venim haue, with languishing to send vs to the graue. My brethen deare (the ruler then gan say) our whole desire hath beene both night &amp; day. Not for to see the seede of Abrham loste, for which we striue against this furious hoste. VVhat? haue ye paine? so likewise paine haue we: For in one bote we both imbarked be. Vpon one tide, one tempest doeth vs tosse, Your common ill, it is our common losse. Th' Assyrian plague shall not vs Hebrews grieue, when pleaseth God our mischiefe to relieue, which he will doe if ye can be content &amp; not with grudge his clemencie preuent. Then striue not you against that puissant king who creat all, and gouerns euerie thing For confort of his church &amp; children deare, &amp; succours them though time do long appeare. Sometime an Archer leaues his bow vnbent &amp; hong vpon an naile to that intent: It may the stronger be to bend againe, And shoot the shot with greater might &amp; maine: Right so th' eternall doth witholde his ill A longer time (perchaunce) for that he will More egerly reuenge him of their crime, who do abuse his long forbearing time. When men applauds to sinne, they count it light, And but a matter small in sinners sight. But in the end the weight doth so encrease, that Iustice leaues the sinner no release, Like th' Vserer who lends vpon the skore, &amp; maks the reckles debters debt the more. What if the thundring Lord his iustice stay, And (for such sinne) do not this tyrant slay? The waters of the ground and in the aere, Are in the hand of God, then who is there, that dare sediciously his yoke refuse, Although he haue not water now to vse? No, no, though heavne do seeme serene &amp; cleare, On euerie part, &amp; wete doth not appeare. He may with moisture mildly wete the land, Sam 1. 12.As fell when Saull the Scepter had in hand: For all the starres that do the heavne fulfill, Are all but executors of his will. All this could not the peoples thrist asswage, But thus with murmurs they their Lords outrage: what? shall we dye, ô sacred soldiers bolde, for pleasure of our lords these traytours olde? what? shall we dye on credit, for to please These wyzard fooles who winks at our vnease, who with our blood, would win th? selfs renown, So louable, as neuer shall go downe? Nay, nay, let vs cut off this seruile chaine, to free our selfs, let vs in hands retaine the ruling of this towne, the forte and all: Least we into these deadly dangers fall. Then like a wise Phisitian who persaues His patient that in feruent feuer raues: Yet hights him more then Art can well performe So Prince Osias in this rurall storme, He promist to the people their intent If God within fiue dayes no succour sent. Then Izak left their sorrowes all and some, &amp; present wo and feare of chaunce to come for that, if they through this, gat not their will: At least they would auoyd, the greatest ill. But Iudtih th? whose eyes (like fountains two) were neuer dry which witnest well her wo: Right sad in sound th' Almightie she besought, And on the sacred scriptures fed her thought? Her prayers much auailde to raise her spreete Aboue the skye &amp; so, the scriptures sweete: A holy garden was where she might finde, the medcyne meete for her molested minde. Then Iudith reading there as was her grace: She (not by hazard) hapned on that place, Iudicium. 3. where the lamehanded Ahud (for disdaine to see the Iewes the Heathen yock sustaine) Smote Eglon with a dagger to the heft, And from his flanke the blood and life bereft. The more she red, the more she wonder had of Ahuds act, and hote desire her lad t'ensue his vertue: yet her feeble kinde Empeached oft the purpose of her minde Proposing oft the horrour of the deed, The feare of death, the danger to succeede, with haszard of her name, and more then that, Though she likewise the peoples freedome gat: yet for a man, this act more seemly weare, than for a wife to handle sword of speare: VVhile Iudith thus with Iudith did debate, a puft of wind blew downe that leafe by fate: Discovring vp the storie of Iacll how she droue a naile into Sisaras brow, And slew that Pagan sleeping on her bed VVho from the Hebrewes furious hoste was fled. In teaching vs albeit a tyrant flee, yet can he not auoyde the lords decree. This last example now such courage lent, to feeble Iudith that she now was bent: with wreakfull blade to sley &amp; to deuorse the Heathen soule from such a sinfull corse. But while she did her carefull minde imploy to find some meanes to murder this Vizroy: She hard report (that made her hart to swoune) Of the determination of the toune: Then all the present perils to preuent, Vnto the rulers of the towne she went: Reprouing then with words of bitter sweete, what do ye meane? O princes indiscreete. Will ye the helping hand of God restraine, And captiue it within your councels vaine? VVill ye include him vnder course of tymes, who made days, yeares, all seasons &amp; their prymes: Do not abuse your selfs, his power profound Is not to mens Imaginations bound: God may all that he wills, his will is iust, God wils all good to them that in him trust. Now fathers: that which doth my hope reuiue Is onely this: there is no wight on liue: within this towne that hath contracted hands, to serue d?me gods like folke of forraine lands. All sinnes are sinne, but sure this sinne exceeds our former faults, by which our blind misdeeds offends the heavne, by which the lord of might, Is frauded of his honours due &amp; right. In wresting of the titles of his name: To stocks, and stones, and mettels, men do frame. Since Izak then from such a fault is free, Let vs to gods protection cast our ee. Consider that all Iuda rests in feare, Aspecting onely our proceedings heare. Consider that all Iacob in this tresse will follow either-our force or feeblenesse. Consider that this house and alter stands (next vnder God) vpholden with your hands. Thinke that of Izrell whole ye keepe the kaye which if ye quite &amp; giue this tyrant waye. VVho more then death hates all of Izaks kinne, we shall the name of kinbetrayers winne. Then sayd the Captaine I cannot denye, that we offended haue the Lord most hye. Vnwise are we, our promises are vaine, But what? we may not call our word againe. But if thou feele thy hart so sore opprest, that moueth thee to teares for our vnrest, Alas, weep night &amp; day and neuer tyre, So that thy weepings may appease the yre Of that hie Iudge, who heares in euerie parte the perfit prayer of the humble harte. I will (quoth she) and if god giue me grace Repell the siege of this afflicted place By famous stroke. But stay me in no wise, But byde the ende of my bold enterprise: And let me goe when night his mantle spreeds to th' enmies Camp (quod he) if thou wilt needs, The great repressour of oppressors pride Preserue thy hart and hand, and be thy guide. FINIS. THE FOVRTH BOOKE OF Ivdith. THE SOMMARIE OF THE IIII. BOOK. According to the promis that Iudith made to the besieged Captaines in Bethulia, she prepareth her selfe with armour meete for the execution of her enterprise: to wit, The inuocation of the name of God, with a holy determinati? to deliuer her countrey from the hand of the Tyrant: whome she deliberate to ouercome with the sweete and faire apparence of her amiable beutie and behauiour. At her departing to the enemies camp, our Poet introduceth one of the chiefe Captaines of the towne discriuing to another, her stock and vpbringing, with the progresse of her three estates, Virginitie, Mariage, and Widowhood: Thereby setting forth a singular example of all womanly behauiour and vertue. After her enterance to the Camp, she is brought to Holophernes, who was curious to know the cause of her comming there. And after audience giuen, he is so surprised with her beutie &amp; eloquent language, that she obtaineth licence to withdrawe herself by night to the next valley, there to pray to God and continuing this exercise, she requireth strength of the Hyest, that in taking away the chieftaine, she might at one instant destroye all the Heathen Armie. Herein giuing example that the beginning and end of all high attempts, ought to be grounded vpon the fauour and earnest calling vpon him, without whome all wisedome, and humaine force is nothing but wind: and who contrariewise, may by the most feeble instrum?ts of the world, execute things most incredible and incomprehensible to humaine capacitie. Then wofull Iudith with her weeping ees Beholding heavn &amp; prostrate on her knees: Held vp her guiltles hands and God besought, Discovring him the secrets of her thought. O God (quod she) who armed with a speare Dan Symeon, who reuengde his sister deare: Lend me the blade in hand, that I may kill this Tyrant that exceedes all Sichems ill. Who not contents to soile the sacred bed of wedlocke chaste, but more with mischiefe led: Entends thy holie name for to confound, And race Solyma temple to the ground. Ambitious Satrap he, whose hope doth stand In mortall men, led with vnrighteous hand. who rules a hundreth thousand stalworth steeds that combat craues &amp; in our pastures feeds. Not dreading thee, who da?ts both man &amp; beast, And kills &amp; captiues them when they weene least. who str?gths the pore &amp; prydful m? down thrings &amp; wracks at once the powers of puissant kings. Grant gratious God that his bewitched wit May with my crisped haire be captiue knit. Grant that my sweet regards may gall his hart with darts of loue to cause his endles smart. Grant that these gifts of thine my beutie small may bind his furious rage, &amp; make him thrall: grant that my artificiall tong may moue His subtill craft &amp; snare his hart in loue: But chiefly lord grant that this hand of mine may be the Pagans scourge &amp; whole ruine: to th' end that all the world may know our race, Are shrouded so in rampiers of thy grace. that neuer none against vs durst conspire, that haue not felt at last thy furious yre: Euen so good Lord let none of these prophane Returne to drinke of Euphrate nor Hytane. Thus Iudith prayd with many-a trickling teare, And with her sighs her words retrenched weare. At night, she left her chamber sole and colde, Attyrde with Ceres gifts and Ophir golde. O siluer Diane, regent of the night, Darst thou appeare before this lucent light? This holy starre whose contr'aspect most clear, Doth steine thy brothers brightnes in his Sphear? While thus she ment (vnseene) away to slide, Her pearles and Iewels causd her to be spide. the musk and ciuet Amber as she past Long after her a sweete perfume did cast. A Carboncle on her Christall brow she pight, whose firie gleames expeld the shadie night. Vpon her head a siluer crisp shee pind, Lose wauing on her shoulders with the wind. Gold, band her golden haire: her yvrie neck, the Rubies rich, and Saphirs blew did deck. And at her eare, a Pearle of greater vallewe ther hong, th? that th' Egipti? Quene did swallew. And through her collet shewde her snowie brest, Her vtmost robe was coulour blew Cœlest, Benetted all with twist of perfite golde, Beseeming well her comely corps tenfolde. VVhat els she weare, might well bene sene vpon, that Queene who built the tours of Babylon. And though that she most modest was indeede yet borrowd she some garments at this neede. From Dames of great estate, to that entent this Pagan Prince she rather might preuent. Achior then who watched at the gate, And saw this Lady passing out so late, To Carmis spak, who warded eke that night what is she this? where goes this gallant wight so trim in such a tyme: hath she no pittie of this most wretched persecuted Cittie? Quod Carmis then, their flourisht heare of late Merari one, that was of great estate. Who had no childe but one &amp; this is she, The honour of that house and familie. The fathers now do venture bodie and soule, that treasures vpon treasures they may roule: But for the wit or learning neuer cairs, that they should leaue to their succeeding hairs, Like those that charely keepes their rich araye In coffers close &amp; lets it their decaye: while that the naked bodies dyes for cold, for whome the clothes are dearly bought &amp; sold. Comparison.But as the painfull plowman plyes his toyle, with share and culter shearing throug the soyle that cost him deare, and ditches it about, Or crops his hedge to make it vnder sprout, And neuer stayes to warde it from the weede: But most respects to sowe therin good seede: to thend, wh? sommer decks the medowes plaine, He may haue recompence of costs &amp; paine: Or like the mayd who carefull is to keepe, the budding flowre that first begins to peepe Out of the knop, and waters it full oft to make it see seemly show the head aloft, that it may (when she drawes it from the stocks) Adorne her gorget white, and golden locks: So wise Merari all his studie stilde, to facion well the maners of this childe, that in his age he might of her retire, Both honour &amp; confort to his harts desire: For looke how soone her childish to?g could chat as children do, of this thing or of that. He taught her not to reade inuentions vaine, As fathers dayly do that are prophaine: But in the holy scriptures made her reade, that with her milke she might eu? suck the dreade of the most high. And this was not for nought Insomuch as in short time she out brought Apparant frutes of that so worthie seede, which chaungde her earthly nature far indeede: As done the pots that long retains the taste Of licour such, as first was in them plaste: Or like the tree that bends his eldren braunch, that way, wher first the stroke has made him la?ch. So see we wolfs, and bears, and harts full olde, Some tamenes from their da?ted youth to holde. Thus ere the Moone twelf dosen cha?ges past, Virginitie the maydens maners faire in forme were cast. For as the perfite pylot feares to runne Vpon the rocks, with singling sheet doth shunne Cyanes straites or Syrtes sinking sands, Or cruell Capharois with stormy strands: So wysely she dishaunted the resort Of such as were suspect of light report. Well knowing that th' acquaintance with the ill Corrupts the good. And though they euer still Remain vpright: yet some will quarrell pike &amp; common brute will deeme them all alike. For looke how your Companions you elect for good, or ill, so shall you be suspect. This prudent Dame delyted not in daunce, Nor sitting vp nor did her selfe aduaunce: In publike place, where playes &amp; banquets beene In euerie house to see, &amp; to be seene. But rather vnderstanding such a trade, Had bene the wrak of many-a modest mayd: who following wandring Dina wanton dame, Haue oftyme put their noble house to shame: she kept at home her fathers habitation, Both day and night in godly conuersation. She pittious Nurse applyde her painfull thought, to serue &amp; nourish them that her vpbrought: Like to the gratefull stork that gathereth meate, &amp; brings it to her elders for to eate, And on a firtree high, with Boreas blowne, Giues life to those, of whome she had her owne. But if she might some howre from trauell quite At vacant tyme it was her chiefe delyte to read the scriptures, where her faithfull mind Might confort of the heavnly Manna finde. Sometyme she broyded on the canuas gall, Some bird or beast, or Ægle or Eliphant tall. VVhile subtely with siluer nedle fine she works on cloth some historie deuine. Hear Lot escaping the deuouring fire From sinnefull Zodom shortly doth retire To Segor, where his wife that was vnwittie Cast back her eye to see the sinfull Cittie. And for hir misbeliefe God plagued the falt, transforming her into a Piller of salt: Here she Susannes story viuely wrought, How neare she was to execution brought, And yet how God the secret did disclose, And made the mischiefe fall vpon her foes Here Iosephs storie stands with wondrous art, And how he left his cloke &amp; not his hart to his lasciuious Dame &amp; rather chose the Prison, then her armes him to enclose. Here cruell Iephte with his murdring knife. to keepe his vow, bereaues his daughters life. (Her trauell done) her lute she then assayes, and vnto God she sings immortall prayes. not folowing those that plyes their thriftles paine In wanton vearse and wastefull ditties vaine, Thereby t'entrapt great men with luring lookes But as the greedy fisher layes his hookes Alongst the coste to catch some mightie fish More for his gaine, then holesome for the dish. Of him that byes, euen so these sisters braue, Haue louers mo, then honest maydens haue. But none are brunt with their impudent flame, Saue fooles &amp; light lunatikes voyde of shame. Of vertue only, perfite loue doth growe, whose first beginning though it be more slow, then that of lust and quicknes not so fast: Yet sure it is, and longer tyme doth last. The straw enkendles soone, &amp; slakes againe: But yron is slow, and long will hote remaine. Thus was the holie Iudiths chaste renowne so happly spred, through Izrell vp and downe, that many-a man disdaind the damesels fine, with Iewels rich and haire in golden twine, to serue her beutie: yet loues firie dart, Could neuer vnfriese the frost of her chast hart. But as the Diamant byds the h?mer strong, so she resisted all her suters long Vnminded euer for to wed, but rather to spend her dayes with her beloued father till at the last her parents with great care, withstood her will, and for her did prepare. Manasses, one who was of noble race Both rich and faire aswell of sprite as face: Her mariage then was not a slight contract Mariage.Of secrete billes, but by willing act ‘before her frends: The chaunce that once befell ‘to wandring Dina may be witnesse well, ‘that secret mariage that to few is kend, ‘doth neuer leade the louers to good end. For of our bodies we no power may clame ‘except our parents do confirme the same. Then see how loue so holily begunne, Betweene these two, so holy a race they runne, this chaste young-man &amp; his most chastest wife, as if their bodies twaine had but one life. what th' one did will, the other wild no lesse, As by one mouth, their wils they do expresse: And as a stroke giuen on the righter eye Offends the left, euen so by Simpathie: Her husbands dolours made her hart vnglad, And Iudiths sorrowes made her husband sad. Manasses then, his wife would not controule tyraniously, but looke how much the soule Exceeds the corse, &amp; not the corse doth grieue, But rather to preserue it and relieue, So Iudith with Manasses did accorde, In tender loue and honourde him as Lord. Their house at home so holy was too tell it seemd a church, and not a priuate Cell: No seruant there, with villaine iestes vncouth, was suffred to corrupt the shamefast youth. No ydle drunkard, nor no swearing wight Vnpunist durst blaspheme the lord of might. No pleasant skoffer, nor no lying knaue: No daylie Dyce, nor no Ruffian braue, Had there abode: but all the seruants weare taught of their Rulers Gods eternall feare. Manasses, he who saw that in his tyme All iustice was corrupt with many-a cryme, And that the most peruers and ignorant, For money, or fauour, would none office want of high estate, refusde all publike charge: Contenting him with ease to liue at large. from court, and pallace, free from wordly pelf, but since he thought him borne not for himself: But also that some charge he ought to beare for confort of his friends &amp; countrey deare: Yet did he more, not being magistrate, for publike weale, then men of more estate. So that his house, was euen the dwelling due Of Iustice, and his mouth a sentence true. Th' afflicted poore he dayly did defend, and was the widowes ayde &amp; tutor kend, to Orphelines, and was the whole support And chiefe conforter of the godly sorte. The vaine desire of Indian treasurs great, Made neuer his ship to saile nor oare to beat. The greedy hope of gaine with ventruous d?ger, Made neuer his sword be drawn to serue the str?ger. He neuer sold within the wrangling Barre, Deceitfull clatters, causing clients Iarre. But quietly manurde his litle feilde, And took th' encrease therof that tyme did yeilde, He sowde, and planted, in his proper grange (vpon some sauage stock) some frutrie strange. The ground our common Dame, he vndermines On stake &amp; ryce, he knits the crooked vines, and snoddes their bowes, so neither hote nor cold might him (from labour) in his chamber holde. But once as he beheld his haruest traine, with crooked Cickle cutting downe the graine the sunne a distillation on him sent, whereof he dyed, his soule to heauen it went. He that the nomber of the leaues could cast, that in Nouember fals by winter blast, He that could tell the drops of raine or slete, that Hyad Orion or Pleiades wete sheds on the ground, that man might only tell, Widow-head. what teares from Iudiths eyes incessant fell. VVhat treasur-and golde &amp; what he left her tho, In place of pleasure, caused all her woe. The sight of them made her in hart recorde, their olde possessor, and her louing Lord. Though she had had asmuch of gold and good, As Lydia land, or Tagus golden flood: (yet losing him) of treasure she was bare: For whome, all other treasures causde her care. Yet in this state she stoutly did sustaine, Like patient Iob (contempning) all her paine. Three times the sunne returned had his prime, ‘Since this befell, and yet the slyding tyme ‘That wonted is to weare all woes awaye, Could neuer for his death her dolour staye: But alwayes in some black attyre she went Right modestly &amp; liu'd on litle rent. Deuout she was &amp; most tymes sole and sad with dole in hart &amp; mourning vesture clad, Outshedding teares as doth the turtle doue on withred stalke that waills her absent loue: And widow like all pleasure doth forsake And neuer intends to take a secound make. Thus Iudith chast within her house abode, And seldome was she sene to come abrode, Vnlesse it weare to see some wofull wife, whose childe or husband was bereft of life, Or for to visit some in sicknesse rage, their longsome paine and dollours to asswage: Or for to go to Church as God allowes to pray and offer, &amp; to performe her vowes. Thus haue I shortly told you brother deare, the state of her, on whome our citie heare haue fixed all their eyes: but I can nought tell wher she goes, much les whats in her thought. But if we may of passed things collect the things to come: then may we well aspect Great good of her, for that euen in her face Is signe of ioy, and great presage of grace. Or some good hap. With this and other talke they cut the night as they together walke. This while the worthie widow with her mayd Past towards th' enmies camp not vnafrayde: For ere she had two hundreth paces past, The Syrian Soldiers in her way were cast: VVho spack her thus. O faire excellent wight whence? what art thou? what doest thou here this night In Syrian camp? I am (quod she) againe An Izralite whome dollours doth constraine, To flee this towne, and for my lifes relief, submits me to the mercie of your chiefe. They tooke her to the Duke, but who hath sene the throngs of folke where proclamations bene In s?e great town, or where some m?strous beast Is brought &amp; wondred at by most &amp; least, that m? might Iudge what flocks of soldiers came From euerie part to see that Hebrew Dame, To see that faire, so chast, so amiable: the more they gasde, she seemd more admirable. Her wavring haire disparpling flew apart In seemely shed, the rest with reckles art with many-a curling ring decord her face, and gaue her glashie browes a greater grace. Two bending bowes of Heben coupled right, two lucent starres that were of heavnly light. two geaty sparks where Cupid chastly hydes. His subtill shafts that from his quiuer glydes. Tweene these two sunnes and front of equall sise, A comely figure formally did ryse VVith draught vnleuell to her lip descend where Momus self could nothing discomend. Her pitted cheekes aperde to be depaint, with mixed rose &amp; lillies sweete and saint: Her dulcet mouth with precious breath repleate Excelde the Saben Queene in sauour sweete. Her Corall lips discovred as it were two ranks of Orient pearle with smyling chere. Her yvrie neck and brest of Alabastre, Made Heathen men of her, more Idolastre. Vpon her hand no wrinkled knot was seene, But as each nail of mother of pearle had beene. In short this Iudith was so passing faire, that if the learned Zeuxis had bene thaire, And seene this Dame, when he with pensile drew, the Croton Dames, to forme the picture trew Of her, for whome both Grece and Asia fought: Helen. this onely patron chief he would haue sought. No sooner Iudith entred his Pauillion, But in her face arose the red vermillion with shamefast feare: but then with l?guage sweet The courteous Genrall mildly gan her greet. My loue, I am, I am not yet so fell, As fals reporte doth to you Hebrews tell. They are my sonnes &amp; I wilbe their father that honours me: and them I loue the rather, that worships for their God th' Assyrian King: They shalbe well assurde to want nothing. And this shall Izak know if they will render Vnto that bonteous king as their defender. For thy (my loue) tell me withouten feare, the happie motyf of thy comming heare. O Prince (quoth she with an assured face) Most strong and wise &amp; most in heauens grace, that drawes the sword, with steele vpon his brest with helme on head, and launce in yron rest: Since that my feeble Sex and tender youth, Cannot longtime endure, the cruell drouth, the wakrife trauels, frayes and haszards great, That day and night, our Burgesses doth threat: Yet neuerthelesse this is not whole the cause that from my Citties body me withdrawes to this your Camp: but that most grudging griefe, Which burnes my zealous hart without reliefe: Is this (my Lord) I haue a holy feare to eate those meates that God bids vs forbeares But Sir, I see that our besieged towne, Is so beset with mischiefe vp and downe. The people wilbe forst to eate in th' end the meats that God expresly doth defend: Then will the lord with iust reu?ge him wreak Vpon all those, that do his statutes break. Withouten fight their Citties he will sack, And make one man of thine ten thousand wrack, that flyes his furie, and thy furious face, Nowe I of Bethull am, and in this place Beseech thy noble grace if so thee please, with courteous ayde, to giue my dolours ease. ‘Of common sence he is depriued cleene, ‘that falls with closed eye on danger seene. ‘And he that may both paine and hurt eschewe, ‘Is vaine if he his proper death pursewe, Then in this quiet dale if I may byde (in secret) for to pray ech evning tyde to God: I shall as he doth me enspyre, Assure you when enkendled is his yre, Against our folke. Then shall I take on hand, to leade thine Armie through all Iurie land, And streaming standarts set on Syon hill, where none with weapons dare resist thy will. No, not a verie dog in euening dark, At noyse of harnes shall against thee bark. Thy onely name shall fray the Armies bold, Before thy face the mountaine tops shall fold. The floods shall drye &amp; from their running stay, To make thine Hoste, a new &amp; vncouth way. O Iewell of the world (quoth he) ô Dame, For gratious spech and beutie worthie fame, Now welc?e here, would God it might you please Longtime with vs to dwell in rest and case, For if your faith and trouth concurrant be, to this your talke, which greatly pleaseth me: I will from this time forth with you accord, to serue your onely Hebrewes God &amp; Lord, And will my seruice whole to you enrowle: Not of my Scepter onely, but my soule. I will your name and honour ay defend From Hebrew bounds vnto the world his end. This sayd: with silence as the moone arose, The widow her withdrew, and forth she goes Vnto a valley close on euerie part, where as she washt her corse &amp; clenst her harte: And with her weeping eyes the place beraid, And to the God of Izak thus she praide. O Lord withdraw not now thy helping hand from those, that at thy mercie onely stand. O Lord defend them that desires to spend their goods and blood, thy cause for to defend. O Lord grant that the cryes of Children may with plaints of oldmen weeping night and day. And virgins voyces sad in shroude of shame And laudes of Leuits sounding forth thy fame. Mount to thy throne, and with dissundring breake thy heauie sleepe. VVherefore doest thou awreake thy self on Hermon with thy burning blast? or why? doest thou on carefull Carmell cast Thy dreadfull darts? forgetting all this space, these Giants that thy Scepter would displace? Ah wretch what say I? lord apardon me, thy burning zeale (and none hypocrisie) that frets my heauie hart at euerie howre Compels my toung rhis language out to powre. O thou, the euerliuing God, and Guide of all our race, I know thou wilt prouide For our reliefe against this furious boste, And iustly kill the Captaine of this hoste. I know, that thou wilt help my onely hand, to be the wrak, of all this heathen band. FINIS. THE FIFTH BOOKE OF Ivdith. THE SOMMARIE OF THE V. BOOK. Holophernes being surprised with the sweete language, and excellent beutie of the chaste Iudith becommeth altogether negligent of his charge &amp; gouernement. Wherein is represented the vnhabilitie of the reprobate, who can not withstand such temptations as the lord sendeth vpon them. But as they become slaues to their owne affections, so by the same they are enforced to fall into perdition. In place of some faithfull seruant to warne him of his vyces, Holophernes conferreth with Bagos an Eunuch, who feedeth him in his humour, and bringeth Iudith to his Tent. And here the Poet reproues all flatterers &amp; bawdes with the vyces of all Courts in Generall. Iudith seing her chastisse in perill, and the time vnmeete to execute her enterprise: Subtly drawes the Tyrant to talke of other affaires. He thinking to insinuate himself the more into her fauour, taketh pleasure to crack of his conquests and of his speciall worthinesse: discoursing so long till suppertyme aproached and she auoided the inconuenience: And here is to be noted that whilest the tyrants boste of their crueltie against the Church, God prouideth for his owne and preserueth them for that worke, that he hath orderned by them to be done. In stead of mary-in bone, and blood in vaines, Great Holopherne doth feed his cruell paines: He bootlesse flees, and feeles, but he ne knowes the quenched fire that of his ashes growes. For so the charming Image of this Dame, the onely mark wherat his soule did ame, Transported him in passions of dispare, that of his mightie camp he quits the care, And goes no more his matters to dispatch, Nor vewes his corpsgard, nor relieues his watch, Nor counsell calls, nor sent to spye the coste, Nor vewes the quarters of his spacious hoste. But as the sheep that haue no hirde nor guide, But wandring strayes along the riuers side: Throu burbling brookes, or throu the forests grene Throw medows, closures, or throu shadows shene: Right so the Heathen hoste, without all bridle, Runns insolent, to vicious actions ydle, where none obeyes ech one commanding speaks, Eche one at pleasure from his b?ner breaks: What do you Hebrews now within your wall? Now time to fight, or neuer time at all, To pay these Pagans, whose confused corse, Combats against themselfs with deadly forse. Nay, stay a while, of such a great victorie, Your onely God will haue the onely glorie. Before this tyrant was with loue yblent To winne the towne, he plyde his whole entent: But now both night &amp; day his mynd doth frame to conquer, this most chast vnconquest Dame. So lust him led: th' vndaunted Theban knight, with weightie mace had neuer him affright: But now a womans looke his hart enfeares, And in his brest the curelesse wound he beares. Ambition erst, so had him ouercumme, that made him dayly ryse by sound of drumme. Now Cupid him awaks with whote allarmes, That him witholds to do the Hebrewes harmes. Before he rulde aboue both prince and king, now can he not himself in order bring. Alas (quod he) what life is this I haue Complaint. Becomming captiue to my captiue slaue? (vnhappie chance) what life is this I say? My vertue gone, my forces falls away. Nay sure no life, it is more paine I feele, Then Ixion torne vpon th' Eternall wheele: Prometheus. My life is like the theefes that stoale the fire On whose mortall hart doth alwayes tire. A rauenous fowle that gnaues him to the bone, Reuiuing still bound to the Scythian stone, what serues it me t'haue won wher I haue ha?ted? what serues my victor arme for to haue daunted? The people situate tweene Hydaspe large, And port wher Cydnus doth in sea discharge? Since I am vanquisht by the feeble sight, Of captiue Iudith what auaills my might? My targe of steele, my Burguinet of Brasse, My guard of warriours stout where so I passe, Since her sweete eye hath sent the pointed dart Throgh men &amp; weap?s pearcing throu my hart. What serues my coursers, who with swiftnes light Exceeds the swallow swiftest bird of flight: since I on him cannot auoide one ynch, the care that night and day my hart doth pinch. Then ch?ge (ô Hebrews) ch?ge your tears in song, And triumphe ore-my hoste and army strong. I am no more that Duke whose name allone, hath made great wariours quake both lim &amp; bone But I am he, whose hart was sometime braue: Now lesse then nought, the slaue but of a slaue. I come not here your Izak to annoy, with fire and sword, your houses to distroy: But to require your Iudith her to render More milde to me. What is my wit so slender (berapt with loue) haue I not here my ioye. that onely may relieue me from annoye? yet neuerthelesse I clieue the aire in vaine, with plaints and makes myne eyes but fountaines twaine TantalusI wretch am like the wretched man indeed: the more he hath the greater is his need. Although he deeply plonge in water cleare, To quenche his thirst: yet is he not the neare, for so do I respect the heavnly grace, that largely is bestowde vpon hir face, that with mine eyes I dare not her behold, My toung doth stay &amp; in the pallet folde. Why haue not I a hart of Chrystall cleare, Transparant through to let my paine appeare? that there she might of all my torments reed, Which loue withholds within my hart in dreed? Now since, that Iudith to this camp aryvde, the light of heavn had thrise his course revyvde, And darkned thrise, and gan with saffron hewe to light the Ynds, the fourth day to renewe: when thus the Duke who left repast and rest Vnto his Eunuch this like porpos drest. O Bagos sonne adoptife not by chaunce, whome I haue chose of nought thee to aduance By speciall grace, and made thee (though I boste) first of my hart, and second of myne Hoste: I rage, I burne, I dye in desprate thought, Throgh loue by this same str?gers beutie broght. Go seeke her then, and shortly to her saye, what secrete flame torments me day by day: shew that I shall her to such honours bring, As he that beares the Scepter of a King: But chiefly see thy talke be framed thus, that she do come this night and suppe with vs. Now should it not to me be folly and shame, to haue within my holde the fairest dame, That ground doth beare, if I dare not aspire, to quench the burning flame of my desire? I should but serue my soldiers for a Ieast, And Iudith faire wold count me but a beast. Then Bagos well acquaint with such a cast He fed the lamp that brunt but ouerfast. If priuate men (quoth he) and people poore, that goes not ouer the threshold of their doore, But spends their dayes in trauell and debate, And neuer seeks to win a better state: Liues not content, if that the Cyprian Dame Do not sometime their frozen harts enflame? what slaues are those then on whose baks ar drest The burdens of this world? who takes no rest, for Publike weale: but wakes with Argus eyes For others ease that to no care applyes: If they among so many great vexations, May not receiue in loue some recreations? Pursue your loue my Lord, and make no let, to take the fish that els is in your net. And as ere this you haue me faithfull found, In like Ambassades when ye them propound So shall you find me in this loue of new, To be as faithfull secret trest and trew. Alas how many such are in our tymes In princes Courts that high to honour clymes, More for their handling such an enterprise, Then for their being valiant learnde or wise? S?times the Courts of kings were verteous skooles now find we nought in Court but curious fooles. O you whose noble harts cannot accord, to be the sclaues to an infamous lord: And knowes not how to mixe with perlous art, the deadly poyson with the Amorus dart: whose natures being free wills no constraint, Nor will your face with flattring pensile paint, for well nor wo, for pittie, nor for hyre, Of good my Lords their fauours to acquyre: Go not to court if yee will me beleue: For in that place where ye think to retreue, the honour due for vertue, ye shall find nought but c?t?pt, which leaues good m? behind. Ye worthy Dames, that in your brests do beare Of your Al-seing God no seruile feare: ye that of honour haue a greater care, then sights of Courts I pray you come not thare. Let men that in their purse hath not a myte, Cloth them like kings, and play the hypocryte, And with a lying tale and feined cheare, Courtcozen them whom they wold see on beare: Let their, the Pandar sell his wife for gaine, with seruice vyle, his noblesse to attaine. Let him that serues the time, chaunge his entent, VVith saith vnconstant saile at euerie vent. Ye sonnes of craft, beare ye as many faces, As Proteus taks among the Marine places, And force your naturs all the best ye can to counterfait the grace of some great man: Camelion like, who taks to him ech hewe Of black or white, or yellowe greene or blew, that comes him next. So you that finds the facion to hurt the poore, with many-a great taxacion: you that do prease to haue the princes eare, to make your names in Prouinces appeare, ye subtill Thurims, sell your fumish wind, to wicked wights whose sences ye do blind. Ye fearefull Rocks, ye ymps of Achelois, who wracks the wisest youth with charming vois: ye Circes, who by your enchantment straunge, In stones and swine, your louers true do chaunge: ye Stimphalids, who with your youth vptaks, ye rauens that from vs our riches raks: Ye who with riches art, and painted face, For Priams wife, puts Castors sister-in place: ye Myrrhas, Canaces, and Semirames, And if there rest yet mo defamed dames, Come all to Court, and there ye shall resaue A thousand gaines vnmeete for you to haue. There shall you sell the gifts of great prouinces, there shall you sell the grace of graceles princes. Stay heare my muse, it thee behoues to haue Great constancie and many-a Hercles braue to purge this age, of vyces more notable, then was the stals of foule Ægeans stable. Returne to Iudith, who to bring to passe, Her high atempt, before her sets her glasse And ginnes to deck her hair like burnisht gold, whose beutie had no pere for to behold. Then went she to his tent where she espide, the gorgious tappestries on euerie side, Of Persian Kings, of Meds, and Syrian stories, How Nin? first (prict forth with great vainglories) Subdewde the East Then next in order came (disguisde in kinde) his wife Quene Semirame: who tooke the Scepter and with tourrets hye great Babylon erected to the skye. Lo, how a Prince with fingers white and fine Sardanapalus.In womans weede the tender twist doth twine, who bare a Rock in sted of Royall mace, And for a man with woman changeth grace In gesturs all, hee frisles and he fards, He oynts, he bathes, his visage he regards In Christall glasse, which for his sword he wore, And lost his crowne without all combat more. Amongst his vertugals for ayde he drew from his Leutenant who did him pursew, And wan his Scepter. Yet with feeble yre, He brunt himself, and ended his empyre. Behold a Bitch then feeds a sucking childe, Amongst the pricking thornes and brambles wild who grew so great &amp; was of such a fame, Cyrus. that bond, and free, his waged men became, And afterward subuerted to his lawe, the Median scepter vnder Persians awe. But what is he that so deformed goze Before the camp and want his eares and noze? Zepyrus. that was that seruant true, who by that slight, Brought Babylon againe in Darius might. While Iudith fed her eyes with figurs vaine, Her hart replete with passions and with paine: the Genrall came, and with a visage gent, Saluted her, and by the hand her hent, And caused her sit downe vpon a chare, the more at ease to vew her beuties rare. Then when he saw himself so neare his pleasure, He brunt in hart &amp; scarse could byde the leasure, Till Venus with her garland shewde in sight On his Horizon to renue the night. This widow finding then the tyme vnmete, Gods iust determination to complete Made much delay, and fand full many-a skuse, with sundrie talke this tyrant to abuse: And sayd my Lord, I pray you shewe to me, what furie iust hath movde your maiestie, what haue our people done (please it your grace) By whome or when that Izaks holy race, Might so prouoke a Prince to wrackfull warre In toungs, and lawes, so seprate from vs farre? Then sayd the Duke, vncourteous should I be If I denye (ô faire) to answer thee. Now as the heavne two Sunnes cannot containe, So in this earth two kings cannot remaine Of equall state. So doth ambition craue, One king will not another equall haue. My Prince is witnesse who at warrs did fall, with king Arphaxat cause he raisde his wall Of Ecbatane so high that it did shame to Niniué, and Babell feard the same: For which, he vndertooke to spoyle his throne, And race his Scepter to the lowest stone: with spite, his buildings braue, he cast adowne. Arphaxat then, a man of great renowne, And worthie of his Scepter and his state, thought better in the field to make debate, Then beare a scorne, his Meds to battell drew. Thus tweene them two did cruell warre ensewe. Arphaxat armed all the yles of Greece, where Iason was, but sought no golden fleece, But golden lingots with aboundant gaine, wher Phasis streame bedewes the pleasant plaine. The Harmastans, and Albans, strong, and wise, that sowes but once, and haue their haruest thrise. The men that neare to Oxus banks abydes, And those that Antitaurus horns deuydes. And those that mans the mount vpon whose brest the shipt that scapt the genrall flood did rest: And those that are (not hyd) within the Reame, wher proude Iaxartes flowes with furious streame. In short: the Meds brought men to ayde their plea From Pontus farre beyond the Caspian sea: And of this Hoste Arphaxat was commander with hope and hart more high then Alexander. My prince desirous then to winne or dye, Left nought vndone that furthred to supplye: His troubled state. He armed Syttacene, And waged Archers out of Osrohene: ye lords of lands that yelds the hundreth corne, Leaue Euphrates &amp; bounds where ye were borne: ye Carmans bolde that all on fish do feede, And of their pelts do make your warlike weede: Leaue Hytan bounds, go seeke the golden sands, ye Parths, ye Cosses, Arabs, and ye lands, That of your Magi Prophets thinks ye know, their spells deuine, your self for pikmen show, O Calde, chaunge thine Astrolab and square To speare and shield: for, we no wight will spare Of able age, of high or lowe degrie, that trails the pik or launce layes on his thie. Let women, Children, and the burghers olde At home alone, let them their houses holde. VVe somond eke the Persians and Phœnicians, the soft Ægyptians, Hebrewes, and Cilicians: to come in hast. &amp; ioyne their force to ours: But they disdainfully deteind their powrs: And with their wicked hands and words vnsage, They did our sacred messengers outrage. My maister for a time, put vp this wrong, Attending tyme, to quite these enmies strong, with purpose more at leasure to prouyde, t'abate this sacrilegious peoples pride. Two greater kings were neuer seene beforne, Battell.Then camped was in Ragau field at morne, with hautie harts enarmed all in yre: Ech soldier set an other so on fire, that scarsly they could keep them in their bound till pype or Cymball or the trumpets sound, Denounce the choke: but with ther furious faces, they thret their foes afarre with fell menaces, And strokes at hand, two thousand Lads forlorne, (to blunt the sword) were downe in battell borne. Vpon their flanks flew feruently the stones, that bet their bucklers to their brused bones, The squadrons then, steps sternly to the strokes, with harts in humain all the battell yokes, And are supplyde with many mightie bands, Some counters them, and sternly them withstands, with foote to foote ech other ouer plyes, Both Meds and Caldes clasp with gastly cryes, Like Nilus streame that fr? the rocks doth r?ble, Or Encelade when he in tombe doth tomble. Here some lyes headles: some that cannot stand, trails on his wombe &amp; wants both foote &amp; hand, cut off with stroks, some perst throu plate &amp; mails, Some shoulder slasht, some panched in th' entrails. Some brains outbet, some in the guts were gorde, Some dying vomit blood, &amp; some were smorde. Some neither quicke nor dead do yet attend, what place it pleaseth god their soules to send: So loth the litle life that doth abyde, Is from the dying body to deuyde. The ground that erst was yellow, grene, &amp; blew Is ouercled with blood in purpure hew. While this man giues some one his deadly baine, He of another gets the like againe. The rage encreasing growes with yrefull flame, the field is spred with bodies dead and lame. Like as ye see the wallowing sea to striue, Flood after floode, and waue with waue to driue, Comparison. Then waues with waues the floods with floods do chace And eft returns vnto their former place: Or like the crops of corne in mids of May, (blowne with the westren wind) aside doth sway: Both to and fro, as force doth them constraine, And yet their tops redresseth vp againe: So whiles the Syrians, are by Meds displaced, And whiles the Meds, by Syrians are rechaced. Then like two raging floods that down doe fall From two contrarie mutine mountaines tall: Downe bearing bridge &amp; bank, and all destroyes, And striues which one may do the most annoyes: So these two kings in force and courage stout, Exceld the rest with slaughter them about, VVherso they preast, they left on either side, Behind them two long opned wayes and wide: for all their bucklers Morions and Quiraces, were of no proofe against their peisant maces. Yet (for the time) the Meds so fearcely fought, that they th' Assyrian bands in terrour brought, And pauld their soldiers harts &amp; brak their might: Who (ouercome) tooke them to shamefull flight. The Meds pursewde and wounded in that chace, ten thousand men, but none vpon the face. In short, this day our Scepter had depriued, Had I not like the thunder dint arriued In battels brunt. Their male &amp; their vantbras, Their helme and shield, before my Coutelas, Were fraile as glas: and neuer a stroke I lent, But deadly was, and them more terrour sent, then all our camp. The soldier then in feare with tr?bling hand could scarsly weild his speare. the palhewd knight with hart in brest that quakes His thyes in sadle, and feete in stirrops shakes for dread of me. There some with trenchant glaiue From hight of head, to midle downe I claiue. And some so farre I foyned through the Iack: the blade aperde a foote behind his back: So that the Meds afrayd at such a thing, In heat of fight they fled &amp; left their king, who seing himself betrayd: his clothes he rent, And bloodie towards Ragau towne he went, where we him met, yet (Braue) did him defend, And sought amongst his foes a famous end. As doth the Tyger wilde who sees her den Beset about with hunters dogs and men, that turns her feare to furious raging rife &amp; will not vnreuenged lose her life: So he them thunderbet wherso he went, that neuer-a stroke in vaine his righthand spent: But er with murdring blade they could him quell, Full many-a bold precursor-he sent to hell. At last Arphaxat gan of slaughter tyre And (wounded sore) left both his life and yre: And fell, as doth some huge high planted oak, that long hath byde the winds, &amp; many-a stroak Of many an axe: yet stoutly doth sustaine their trauels long and frustrats all their paine, The roote doth sigh, the dale doth roring sound, And to the heavne the noyse doth high rebound, his head now here, now there, seemes to encline, &amp; threats them here &amp; there with great ruine: Yet stands vpright aboue the highest okes, till, vanquisht with a thousand thousand strokes, He falls at last &amp; brings with him to ground Both trees &amp; cattell to the plaine profound. So with Arphaxat fell the Meas empyre: My king, the king of kings then in his yre Ras'd Ecbatan, and now growes weed &amp; herbe, where sometime stood his palaces superbe. So that where erst the lute and lowde Haubois, were wont to sound with sweete concordant nois, Now shriking owles and other monsters moe In funerall sound fulfils the place with woe. My potent Prince when all this warre was ceast Consumed moneths foure in Royall feast, In Niniué the great, which banket done, He me commanded to assemble sone, His Royall hoste, to punish all and some, that to his former ayd disdaind to come: And that I shortly should with sword and flame Reuenge his honour, but alas Madame Full farre am I from that I would pursewe, for comming here thy nation to subdewe: I v?quisht am by thee, so that deaths might, shall shortly close mine eyes with endles night: If you not (with a louing kisse) to me Restore my life. O worthie Prince, quoth she, Continue your discours, and to me tell, what great aduentures to your Hoste befell. Then he retooke his tale he left a late, And made a long discours of all his state: Part true, part fals, as do some warriours braue, who speaking of their Acts will lye and raue. My camp assembled, then gan I t'enflame Oration.My soldiers harts thus for to win them fame. Companions now, if euer ye pretend To winne renoume that neuer shall haue end. Go forwards now, plague these inhumain lands, that on our sacred legats layd their hands. Reuenge, reuenge, ye men your most hie prince, that euer Scepter bare in rich prouince, that euer came adowne with mightie arme. From circled starres. Alarm' soldats alarme: Take blades in hand, &amp; brands of burning yre, to wast the westren world with sword and fyre, with bloody seas bedewe ech mount and wood, And make your horses fearce to swimme in blood. Receiue the Scepter great &amp; crowne of might, of all this world which is to you behight. Receiue this laude that for your conquest braue, shall draw your fames from the forgetfull graue: Receiue ye valiant men the noble spoyle of many-a land that ye shall put to foyle. Let men behold that sees you day by daye, How ye are cloyde with honour spoyle &amp; pray, thus ended I. And as my words were spent They bet their bucklers, showing them content with courage bolde, to fight with me and byde. Then sixscore thousand men I had to guide, Or moe: and so from Niniuè we past And marched vnto (Bectile) at last, I through Edessi, Amidi, and Carran came, where somtime dwelt your father Abrahame: I wan the mount whose thwarting hornes deuyds All Asie, and serues for bounds on sundrie syds, to many great Empyrs: I slewe, I brent All in my way. My fellon soldiers went Like maowers with their sithes in sowple hands, who leaues not after them a straw that stands: But ample swathes of grasse on ground doth cast, &amp; showes what way their sharped siths haue past. All Lydia knowes, that nought now growes in it but weeds. And Phuli-and Tharsis feeles it yit. I was welneare the straits that closeth all, Phœnice and th' Ishique Rouers, like a wall, when Rosea, Solea, Mops, Anchiali and Iscia, And sweete Egei: and (short) the whole Cilicia, This passage took before and lay in wait, to stay my Armie for to passe this strait. If I the harmes and hassards all should tell of all th' affairs and bloody frayes that fell and succours sent: the day would slide away Before my tale. For that Cilicia I say, through great auantage of their gro?d so narrow Defended them from both the speare &amp; arrow: So that my Hoste that gaue before the chace, to puissant kings: now fled with great disgrace. Craking.Then foming in dispite, dispaire, and yre, I cast my self where shot flew like the fyre, and though they hurt me in a hundreth parts, And though my Buckler bare a wood of darts: yet left not I, but with audacious face: I brauely fought, &amp; made them all giue place. My Armie followde where my arme made way with trenching blade, on bodies dead that lay. The greatest coward that my captains led, Pursewd &amp; slew, the most of them that fled. The Cidnus streame (who for his siluer flood Esteemd a king ran now with humaine blood. The Pyram fearce, in seas discharged than Full many-a helm, &amp; sword and worthie man. In short as your owne riuer seemes to rest with swelling tyds and frothy floods represt within his bank: yet furiously him wreaks with weightie force &amp; banks and bridges breaks, &amp; stroyes the plaines, and maks for many-a day More wrak, then if his channels open lay: In semble sort their bands I did enchace, that kept the entrance of that craggie place. I brunt, I slew, cast downe, all that I fand, And Asia spoild, I entred th' easter land. I wan Celei, and raged pittie les Vpon the frutefull shore of Euphrates. I bet the desart Rapse, &amp; Eagria land, who knowes the vertue of my conquering hand. From thence to seaward sewing mine entent I wasted Madian. Northward then I went to Liban ward, Damascus ouerrinning, with other towns, Abilia &amp; Hippas winning. Fr? thence, with curious mind my standerds styes, the hill, where sunne is sene to set and ryes. And so from thence I forward led mine hoste, To th' Occident on the Phœnician coste. Then Sidon, Bible, Beryte, Tyre, &amp; Gaze, with Ascalon, and Assot, in a maze, For feare, sent humblie to my sacred seat, wise messengers, my fauour to entreat. We come not here, my lord sayd they, with armes for to resist the chok of thy Gensd'armes: But Prince, we come, of thee for to resaue, Both life and death, &amp; what lawe we shall haue, Our townes ar thine, our citties &amp; our hills, Our fields, our flocks, our wealth is at your wills. Our seruice, and our treasures, great and small, Our selfs, our wyues, and our faire children all: Now onlie rests to thee, if so thee please to take vs thus. O God what greater ease: O god what greater good may vs befall, Then vnto such a chiefe for to be thrall? who weilds the valiant lance &amp; ballance right, with vertue like the Gods of greatest might So weare to me, as gracious to beholde Their townes &amp; Citties both, for yong and olde with crownes, and presents of the Flora sweete, &amp; costly odours, humbly did me greete. At sounds of hornes &amp; pypes they dauncing went with goods and bodyes me for to present. Then I abusing not the law of armes Entreated them, and did to them no harmes, nor to their lands. But first their forts I mand, with men of mine, and theirs tooke in my band. For where that I, my people farthest drew, My camp in bands, from bands, to armies grew, As doth the Danow which begins to flow By Raurak fields with snakish crangling slow, then swels his floods with sixtie riuers large, that in the Golfe Euxin? doth discharge: I wende Madame that Izrell like the rest, would yeald to me, that I should not be strest Against their brest to moue my murdring speare, But as I came the Scythique rampier neare (the Tombe of her whose milk had such a hap To feede the twice borne Denis in her lap) I hard their wilfull rage first in that place, which doubtles will distroye all Abrahms race. FINIS. THE SIXTH BOOKE OF Ivdith. THE SOMMARIE OF THE VI. BOOK. Iudith hauing escaped the perill of her chastitie, is brought to a sumpteous banquet prepared by Holophernes for the intertainement of her, and farder prouocation of his filthie lust: In which the abhominable vice of gluttonie is by the Poet viuely descriued, and sharply reprehended. And whereas the Tyrant thought by such excesse to ouercome the chaste widow: himselfe is so ouercome with wine, that vpon a verie simple delay he lets her goe till he was in his bed. And here is noted that the snares that the wicked layes for others, they fall in them their selfs. Whiles the Tyrant contemplated his lust, Iudith in trouble called vpon her God, who made way for her worke through the Tyrants owne wickednesse: who he aping sin vpon sinne, approched at last to the end of his tragedie, and mounting vpon the skaffold of the yre of God, falles a sleepe in his sinfull bed, and is by Iudith beheaded in his beastly dronkennes. True it is that in this execution she felt her great infirmitie, but likewise she found that God was able to strengthen the most feeble for the execution of his Iustice. And as before she was preserued in the midst of her enemies: so the Lord to make a miraculous end of his worke, brings her safe home to her people. The Bethulians giues thankes to God. The Ammonit rauished with this miracle, embraced the true religion. The head of Holophernes (that Iudiths seruant brought) being set vp for a terrible spectakle to the Heathen, encouraged the Cittezens to giue assault vpon the camp. Bagos, who had bene an instrument of the tyrants wickednes, is the first that finds his musters headles Carkas, and putts the camp in such affray, that they fled all before Israell, in such sort that scarse one was left to bring newes to Niniuè, of the fortune of the battell. And that was Gods Iustice, that those that had followed this tyrant in his wickednesse, should be companions of his death. Iudith last of all celebrates the deliuerance of God with a song, to the honour and glorie of his almightie name. Before the Pagan had his purpose ended, the night obscure fr? m?tains high desc?ded And sewers set the bord with costly meate, Of passing price, so delicate to eate, that Holopherne vnto his ioyous feast Aperd t'haue cald the kings of west and East. O glutton throtes, ô greedy guts profound, Exclamation.the chosen meats within the world his bound By th' Abderois inuented may not sta?che, Nor satisfie your foule deuouring pa?che: But must in Moluke seeke the spices fine. Canarie suger and the Candy wine. Your appetits (O gluttons) to c?tent, the sacred brest of Thetis blew is rent: the Aire must be dispeopled for your mawes the Phœnix sole can skarse escape your iawes. Gluttonie‘O plague, O poyson to the warriour state, ‘thou maks the noble harts effeminate, ‘while Rome was rulde by Curioes and Fabrices, ‘who fed on roots and sought not for delices, ‘and when the onely Cresson was the foode ‘most delicate to Persia, then they stoode ‘in happy state, renowmde in peace and warre, ‘&amp; throu the world, their triumphes spred afarre: ‘But when they after in th' Assyrian hall, ‘Had learnd the lessons of Sardanapall. ‘and when the other, giuen to belly cheare, ‘By Galbaes, Veroes, Vitells gouernd weare, ‘who gloried more to fill a costly plate, ‘then kill a Pyrrhus or a Mythridate: ‘then both of them were seene for to be sacked ‘by nati?s poore, wh? they before had wracked. Of litle nature liues superfluous meate, ‘But duls the sprite, and doth the stomack freate, When they were set, then throw that Royall rout, the Maluesie was quaffed oft about. One drinks out of an Alabaster Cuppe, one out of Christall doth the Nectar suppe: Some out of curious shells of Vnicorne: Some spills the wine, &amp; some to beds were borne: But namely there the Vizroy would not tyre, But more he drank, the more he had desyre: Like to the Ocean-Sea, though it resaues All Nilus floods, yet all fresh water craues From East to West, yet growes he not a graine, But still is ready forasmuch againe. One glas drawes on another glas, and whan the butler ment to cease he but began, to skinck good Bacchus: thus this dronken wight, Among his dronkards tippled till midnight, then ech of them with stackring steps out went, And groping hands retyring to his tent. This tyrant wisht them oft away before, to whome ech moment seemd to be a skore. Assoone as they were gone, then gan he prease, the trembling Iudith. Cease great prince ô cease the widow sayd: what hast neede you to make to reap the flowre that none other c? fr? you take? My Lord go to your bed &amp; take your ease, wher I your sweet embracings will complease, Assoone as I my garments may remoue, that binds my body brunt with ardent loue. Now if that sober wits and wylie brains Cannot auoyde the female tricks &amp; trains. Abash not reader though this reckles Roy (Bewitcht by Semels sonne, and Venus boy) was thus beguilde: considring both these twaine, Confounds the force of those that them retaine. So letting Iudith slide out of his arme, He gins to lose his garments soft and warme: But throw his hast, his hand came lesser speed, And though he was deceivd, yet tooke no heed, But wening well t'vntrus his peuish points, He knits them twyfold with his trembling ioints: so long till he with anger discontent, cuts me them all, and off his clothes he rent, And naked went to bed. Then as ye see the bloodie bowman stand behind a tree, who warely watches for the wandring deare: to euerie part, where he doth thinke to heare Some trembling bush, some beast or Lezard smal, that mocion maks, so turneth he withall His face, and hand to shoot, but all in vaine for to relieue his long aspecting paine: Euen so, this foolish tyrant when he hard some rat or mouse, then thought he to himward: His Mistris came: and when he hard no more, yet thought (she came) whome most he did adore. VVhile vp he lifts his head, while lets it fall: while lookes about, while counts the paces all, that she should passe, to come vnto his bed. Thus turning oft, as ardent lust him led: he thoght his bed was sown with pricking thorne: but now the drink that he had dr?k beforne, Brewd in his braine, and from his minde it tooke, the sweete remembrance of her louing looke. So fell on sleepe: and then to him appears Ten thousand flames, ten thousand dinns he hears, and dreames of Deuils, and Dæmons dark &amp; dim Medusas, Minotaurs, and Gorgons grim. This while the hart of Iudith gan to beat Incessantly beset with battell great: Onewhile her feare refeld her first entent: onewhile her action Iust her courage lent. Then sayd she Iudith, now is tyme, go to it, And saue thy people: Nay, I will not do it. I will, I will not, Go, feare not againe: wilt thou the sacred gestning then prophaine? Not it prophane, but holyer it shall stand, when holy folke are helped by my hand. But shamefull liues the traitour euermore, No traitour she who doth her towne restore: But murdrers all, are of the heavne forsaken? All murder-is not for murder alwayes taken. Alas are they not murdrers sleys their Prince? This tyrant is no prince of my prouince: But what if God will haue vs vnder his-awe? Hees not of God that fights against his lawe. For then should Ahud, Iahell, and Iehewe, Be homicids, because thy tyrants slewe. But what? they were commanded of the lord, to such an act, my hart should soone accord. Alas my hart is weak for such a deed, th' are strong ynough whom God doth strength at need But when t'is dune who shall my warrant be? God brought me here, God will deliuer me. VVhat if the Lord leaue thee in Heathen hands? were this Duke dead, I feare no death nor bands. but what if they polute thee like a slaue? my body with my hart they shall not haue. Thus she resolued in her mind at last, Her hands and eyes vnto the heavne she cast, And with an humble voyce to God she prayde, O gratious God that alwayes art the ayde to thy beloued Izak, I thee pray, to strength my hand, euen my right h?d this day, that I may make this bloodie tyrant dye, that to discepter thee would skale the skye. But since thy goodnesse hath preserued me, &amp; brought my bote so neare the shoare to be: Graunt that some sleepie drink I may prouide, To dull this tyrants hart and daunt his pride, to thend that I may free thy congregation Vnto thy honour, and our consolation. This prayer done, she looked round about, And hard this dronken prince in sleeping rout, then stept she to his sword that by him stood, which oft had bathd the world with humain blood But as she preast this tyrant for to quell, Feare, reft the sword from her, &amp; down she fell, and lost at once the strength of hart and corse. O God (quoth she) now by thy mightie forse, Restore my strength. This said (with pale annoy) she rudly rose, and stroke this sleeping Roy so fell, that from his shoulders flew his powle, and from his body fled his Ethnique sowle hye way to hell. His bulk all blood bestaind Lay still, his head in Iudiths hand remaind. The which her mayd put vp into a sack, thus throw the camp they close away do pack Empecht of none. For those that had her seene, Suposde she went (as she had wonted bene the nights before) vnto the valley wheare, they thought she went to serue Diana cleare. Wh? Iudith chast came near the Hebrew wall: Let in (quoth she) for our great god of all hath broke this night the whole Assyrian powre, and raisd the horne of Izak at this howre. Then men amazde of her vnhoped state, About her ran assembling at the gate, where holy Iudith on a hill was mounted, And all her chaunce fr? point to point recounted, And there, discovring drew out of the sack, The bloody head of th' enmie of Izak, The Citezins that saw how she did stand with th' ead of Assurs head in her right hand: they praised God who by her hand had slaine, &amp; punished that traitour inhumaine. ‘But most of all Duke Ammon did admyre ‘the work of God. Then he t'escape the yre ‘of Iacobs God who aydes the weakest part: ‘he shortly Circuncisde his flesh and hart. ‘O God that rightly by foresight deuine, ‘repels the purpose of all mens engine, ‘who for to lead th' elect to destnyed health, ‘Eu? wh? it seemes them fardest fr? their wealth. ‘of ill, thou drawes the good, and some in ill ‘thou letst them runne thy Iustice to fulfill. ‘(O lord) the vile desire of blood and sak, ‘made Holopherne to warre vpon Izak. ‘But where that he would Izaks blood haue shed, ‘he lost his owne for Izak on his bed. ‘Thus thy good grace hath made his vaine inuenci?, ‘to take effect contrarie his intencion. ‘So Paull became a Saint, who was a Pherisee, ‘and of a tyrant, teacher of thy veritee: ‘So was the theef that hong with our Messias, ‘(for all his sinne) preserued with Elias: ‘his vitious corps could haue no life here downe, ‘his soule by grace yet got a heavnly crowne. ‘Change th? (ô God) the harts of christi? princes ‘who sheds the faithfuls blood in their prouinces. ‘Let thou that sword that thou giues th? to guide ‘vpon thy enmies onely be applyde. ‘Vpon those tyrants whose vnrighteous horne ‘deteins the land where thy dear son was borne. ‘not on the backs of those who with humilitie, ‘Adores the Triple one great God in vnitie. Then at commandement of this widow chaste, A soldier tooke the tyrants head in haste, And for to giue the Hebrews hart withall, He fixed it vpon the foremost wall. There, fathers came, and sonns, &amp; wiues, &amp; mayds, who erst had lost amongst the Heathen blayds, There sonnes, their parents, maks, &amp; louers deare, with heauie harts &amp; furious raging cheare. They pilde &amp; paird his beard of paled hew, Spit in his space &amp; out his toung they drew, which vsde to speak of God great blasphemies, And with their fingers poched out his eyes. The rife remembrance of so late an ill, Made vulgar folke such vengeance to fulfill. This while Aurora ceased to embrace, Her ancient loue and rose with ruddy face, Vpon the Indian heavne, the warriours strong, that kept the towne: now sorted forth in throng. Enarmed all, with such a hideous sound: as seemde the elements foure for to confound. And break the b?ds that keeps th? in their border, Retyring them vnto their old disorder. The Pagan watches next the Citties side (Awaked with this din) start vp and cryde: Alarme, Alarme, like fearefull men agast, then through the Camp, the whote Alarum past. Some takes his neighbours armour first he finds, Confusi?. And wrong on armes the bracels both he binds. Some takes a staf for hast, and leaues his launce: Some madling runnes, some trembles in a tra?ce: Some on his horse ill sadled ginnes to ryde, And wants his spurres, some boldly do abyde: Some neither wakes nor sleeps, but mazing st?ds: Some braue in words, are beastly of their hands. This brute from hand to hand, from man to man, Vnto the Pagans court at last it ran. Then Bagos Eunuch sadly forth he went t'awake the sleeping Ethnique in his tent, &amp; knockt once, twise, or thrise with trembling h?d But such eternall sleep his temples band, that he had past already (miserable) Of Styx so black the flood irrepassable. Yet Bagos hearing Izaks crye encrease, He with his foote, the dore began to prease: And entred where the bed he did beholde All bled with Holophernes carcasse colde: He tore his haire &amp; all his garments rent, and to the heavne his houling cryes he sent. But when he mist the Hebrew-Dame away then raging he began a gastly fray. And from the bloody tent as he ran out, Among the Heathen thus he gan to shout. Woe, woe to vs, a slaue (they Iudith call) In sleaing Holopherne hath slaine vs all: That daunted all the world. These nouels last, Ioynde the former feare that lately past, Affrighted so the soldiers one and all, that pike and dart, and target they let fall, And fled through m?tains, valeis, &amp; throw heaths where evrie chaunce, procurde th? worser deaths. Then all th' assieged folk in flocks descended, &amp; on their enmies backs their bowes they b?ded. Both parties ran, but th' one that other chased, The wearie flyers flight, themselfs defaced. The Hebrewes there, in fight not one they loste, But they bet downe and slew the Heathen hoste, As doth a Lyon of Getulia woode Bespred the land with woried beasts &amp; bloode So long as he may find a beast abide, that dare oppone him to his cruell pride. Some headlong throwes themselfs fr? craggie Rocks, &amp; breaks their bones &amp; al their brains out knocks Some hath forgot that Parcas euerie wheare, waits on their end that drowne in water cleare: But if that any skapt by some great hap, He skapte the first, but not the after clap: fore all the straits and passages were set, that none should scape aliue wher they were met: Yea scarsly one was left to tell the king, At Niniuè of all this wondrous thing. This battell done, all those whose Sex and age withheld at home (their dolours to asswage) Came forth out of their fort to see and heare, what God had done for them his people deare. They found some men dism?bred hauing breath, that cride in vaine a hundreth tymes for death. Another gnashes with his teeth in paines some dead, in face their former rage retains. And some is shot directly throw the hart Ech soule departs to his appointed part, According to the valew, or the chaunce, that fortunde them to dye on sword or launce. In short to see this sight so dreadfull was, That euen the Hebrews would haue said alas: If they had vanquisht any enmie els, This while amongst the corses infidels, Among a hundreth thousand there was found, the cheftains carcas rent with many-a wound, Of speare and sword, by th' Hebrewes in their yre. There was no sinew, Arter, vaine, nor lyre, that was not mangled with their vulgar rage, No time nor moment might their yre asswage. If Holophern had bene like Atlas long: Or like in limmes vnto Briarius strong, Yet should his body bene to small a praye, to satisfie their fury evrie waye. For in that camp was not so small a knaue, but of his flesh some collup he would haue. O tyrant now (quod they) giue thy right hand, to the Cilicians, and to Media land, leaue thou thy left. And to Celea sweete, to Ismaell and Ægypt leaue thy feete, to thend that all the world by thee offenced with such a present may be recompenced. But here I faile thy corps thus to deuise In Attomy for it will not suffise. This thankfull widow then, who neuer thought to smore this w?dro? work that god had wrought, Entunde her vearse and song to sweet confort Of instruments &amp; past with gratious port Before the chosen Dames and virgins thair, that were esteemde for honest chast and fair. Sing sing with hart &amp; voyce &amp; so?ding strings, And praise the Lord of lords, and king of kings, who doth disthrone the great, and in their place Erects the poore that leanes vpon his grace. Who would haue thought that in a day one town Could ouercome a camp of such renown? who daunted all the world whose pride was felt From Indian shore to where the Calpees dwelt? Great God who will beleeue that Holopherne, who did a hundreth famous princes derne, should be disceptred, slaine, left in a midow, by no great Gyant, but a feeble widow? great God who will beleue that he who raind, From north to south, &amp; in his hands retaind Both East and West: now gets not grace to haue An ynch of Gazon ground to be his graue? This Conqurour that came with no armie small, now lyes on ground abandond of them all. Not sole: for those companions him in death, that followde him while he had life and breath. Not now the gro?d, but Reauens hunger sterude, Are now his tombe as he hath well deserude. No vaults of Marble, rich nor Porphyr pure, that he had built could be his sepulture. Euen so good Lord from henceforth let vs finde, thee, not our Iudge, but for our father kinde. But let all Tyrants that against thee gather, finde thee their Iudge, but not their louing father. Here Iudith ends. And also heare I staye With thanks to God. So for his state I praye, The translatour. At whose command I vndertooke this deed, To please his Grace, and those that will it reed.
