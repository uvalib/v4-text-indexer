George Whetstons wisheth accomplishment of honorable and perfect desires. A Remembraunce of the most Noble, and Honorable life, death, and vertues, of Thomas, late Earle of Sussex, Vicount Fitz-water, Lord of Egremount, and Burnell &amp;c.

Who forthwith wisht, his owne renowne to ring Homer aliue, and Alexander dead: Desire of Fame, Contempt of life so bread, And trueth to say, mans life is but a breath. VVhen Fame outliues, Enuie, Time, and Death. The hope of Fame, as Pallingene doth write, Of yore mens minds, with vertuous thoughts did crown Spes Farnæsolet ad virtutem impellere multos. The Monuments, that Hystoryes resight: Of worthies dead, which liue in bright renown. (when millions mo, a shallow graue doth drown. Are spurs to thrust, the Coward on the pykes.

My selfe for one, who worst may pay this due, but want no will, more able wits to whet this many a day haue laid in open viewe, their liues and deathes, that did by vertues set not fed with hope, rewardes thereby to get, for most men know, it is no way to thriue, to prayse the dead, but flatter men aliue. But God forbid the dead should lose his right, and shame befall, the flattrer at his need some skill I haue on good mens tombes to wright no grace at all at vaine mens bordes to feed, The confusion of flatterie.and now too old the flattring art to read: yet thus my name, shall with the best remaine, when flattrers vade, like thunder, smoke, and raine. Well let this goe, and fall I to my taske, a common griefe doth charge my Muse to wright a sowresweete song for such his friendes as aske for Sussex Earle, most true and noble knight of vertue and vallor, the mirror bright with much adoe, who vanquisht is by death vanquisht, not so, but onely reau'd of breath. The order of the Romain funerals.His purple robe, doth shew his honor sound, his armed sworde, the mettle of his hart. his forward leg in S.

But to discribe this worthie Peere at large in vertue he did blase his noble race, in peace, in warre, a man most meete for charge, whome chaunge nor chaunce, could maske with double face a Tutch that tryes faire semblance often bace. he dreaded these, one God, one king, one law, and of the rest, he stoode no whit in awe. In tender yeares whilst vertue might engraue within his plyant minde, her sacred heast he bent his eate, to heare the counsels graue that Science taught and wrote them in his brest thus still with time his worthines increast At nyntene years of age, he was captaine of a great charge of Demilances. withall so staid when youth was in his pride, as then he wist a vvaightie charge to guyde.

He was Ambassador about the mariage of Quenne Mary and king Philip. betwene the Queene and Philip king of Spaine this Earle was sent, who in this message great behau'd him selfe so nobly, wise and plaine as with successe much honor he did gaine and waighing Armes beseemed best this lord King Philip gaue him a most rich and sworde. the king gaue him a rich and costly sworde. And sure the sworde, becomes the noble best Armes the proper attire for the nobilitie. vpon his necke a shepe-hooke hath no grace God and S.

Millitary Testament.The Cause, there liues, in howerly danger stood: Therefore their actes, held lawful, iust, and good. Queene Mary made him deputy of Ireland and sent after him a patent to be Iustice of an Aire, of al her Forrests &amp;c. On the south side Trent. And made him Captaine of the pentioners and gentlemen at armes.wel, of the King, this sumptuous sword receau'd, This Lord in hart, vou'd to deserue the same: And time wel prou'd, his vow he not deceiu'd, His puisant hand, the Irish rude did tame: And of their heads, did buyld a Fort of Fame: But Enuy which, at worthyest dedes doth spurn: Did raise a blame, which to his praise did turn. Queene Elizabeth.when home he came, he proou'd him self so iust, As in his brow, the Queene his vertues read. She found that he, returned truth for trust. His saying. Abus iniquis &amp; a lingua dolosa, liber auit me Deus, quoniam cor Regina in manibus eius.And with new trust, she gaue his truth her meed. which made him wright, as he had cause in deed.

In Enuies spight, which shines in euery place, As Summers Sunne, doth in the Saylers face. And therfore Iust, this Lord should thus confes. when thousands may, as much as he expres. Wel when he thus, had put suspect to flight: His Princes grace, by vertue soon he wroght. The Starre appear'd, most perfect in her sight. Then Enuies frownes, he set as light as naught. For Merit him, in credit dayly brought. Her maiestie sent him Ambassador vnto the Emperour. In Ambassadge, he to Vienna went Who from the Queene to Th' emperor was sent. His waighty charge, with faithful seruice done, The Queenes Maiestye made him president of Yorke. Rebellion in the North. Home he return'd, with honor for his toile.

The peaceable victory against the Northern rebels. Her Highnesse frends, and subiects he did arme: And with a fewe, the Rebels put to flight: Yer that, the Princes power could come in sight. without bloudshed, this broile thus ended he, Saue such as died, by iustice on a tree. The stur appeas'd, and al in order set, He left his chardge, and to the Court did hy: For seruice true, where he such glory gat: As that he seem'd, a Pearle in Princes eye: No fault in him, til death she could espy. And therfore now, she caus'd his trauels cease: And wild him rest, vpon a staff of Peace. The Queenes Maiestie made him Lord Chamberlaine of her most honorable houshold.Lord Chamberlaine, she of her house him plac'd. An office great, and neare vnto her selfe, Thus stil he rose; whom spight would haue disgrac'd. No Perry serud, to set him on the shelfe: Who only sought for honor, not for pelfe. He serud his Prince, and sought his Countreys good. And for them both, aduentured ofte his bloud When blessed peace his trenching sword did sheath, A Laurel bowe, he managed as wel: In counsell graue, he neede not sit beneath. As time gaue cause, his words were short and sure. His iudgements sound, and likely to endure. He neuer lean'd to fauor, gaine, or hate: But still aduis'd what best auail'd the state. He was a gratious fauorer of oppressed men.His hand that oft the enemy did lame, He reacht to those whose succors were dismayde: His valeant hart that no mischance could tame, Did melt to ruth, when wretches cride for ayde. VVhose cause to pleade, his tongue the mighty frayde. His eye that had in forraine practise sight: was neuer fixt vpon the poore mans right. In this: that he each Christian language spake, He honord much, but seru'd his Soueraigne more: Intreatment good, Ambassadors to make, No man more prest, nor yet more meet therfore. whose reach, their wyles so cunningly would shore. As oft they sayd, by Alligorie thus. Monstrant viam, Astra Regibus. But wel he knewe the starres were thrall to wit, And therfore walkt in wisdomes perfect way: Who finding where a friend of his had writ, Hei: nescio quo me vocant fata. He vnderneath replyed, Fata falsa: And prou'd withall, his answere true in this: Sapiens dominabitur Astris. On such sure ground, thus buylded he his hap: Slie fortune he did neither trust nor feare: Stil as he walkt, he sawe the wyly trap, That Enuy set, the vertuous to snare: And of the same, through wisdome did beware. So that his foes had euermore the foyle, Pericles, spoyling the co?try of Sparta, his souldiors spared hys land to bring him in suspition of the Athenian Senate, who to preuent the suggestions of Enuy, gaue the said land frely vnto the common wealth. Iustim. lib. 3. As those that spar'd Pericles land to spoyle. O happy man that hadst thy vertues tride: As golde in fire, through enuy and suspect. O happy Queene, which had so true a guyde, In peace and warre, to gouerne and dyrect, Happy Commons, whose weale he did respect. Thrise happy Realme, that had him for defence: He blest alone, that death hath tane him hence. But for his losse, why should we mone, or mourne: All humaine flesh a dying day must haue: The stoutest men, that euer Armes haue borne: Maugre their wils, were borne vnto the graue. Asaiels life, his swiftnes could not saue. Sampson, Cæsar, and Alexander great: Were foylde by death, that all the world would beat. This Tyrant yet, no easy Conquest had: Although he charg'd, and charg'd this Lord again: In spight of whom, whose wished life dyd fade, Like Marble Stone, with mysling drops of rayn: So stoutly he, endured grief and payn. But to no boote, auayl'd this valyant strife: The hower approacht, that must dyssolue his life. Yet as the Horse, that stricken is in war, His Rider brings, from danger to be torne: So brought this Earle, his deadly wound thus far, when as he seem'd, a threshed eare of Corne. when as flesh, bloud, and humors al were worne: His noble hart, did foster stil his breath: Vntil his soul, had foyld, the deuil and death. For Nobles lore, his life a Pharos light: His vallor great, the Image of renown, His end doth shew, al sorts of men to fight. In spite of death, theyr soules with ioy to crown. For when that sicknesse came to pluck hym down. As one that had both life and death in scorne: Saue for his sins, he neuer seem'd to mourn. My tyme is come (qd. he) prepare my Hearce, The monster death, no prayer may intreat, His naked breast, the Cannon cannot pearce. Euen as the weak, he wounds the strong and great, He holds for fish, what commeth in his Net. The Prince and Peere, to saue hym from the graue, No Charter haue, more then the wretched slaue. A heauy tale, vnto the worldly wight, That hath helth, welth, and in his bowels peace: which buyes and buylds, and wallowes in delight: That sits him down, and byds hys soule take ease: But foolish man, know that thou shalt decease. The Thunderbolt, the strongest towers teare, And Time in Time, what worldly is wil weare. what is become, of Cæsars Equipage, Of Pompeys Rule, of Alexanders Raign: Of Samsons Strength, of Salamon the sage. Of Tullies skil, of Mydas golden gayn: Of them, and al, this only doth remayn: They liu'd like Gods, and leaue as men did take. And for their pompes, haue large accompts to make. If rule and raign, were seuer'd from this checke. who then could blame, the man that would be great. The mighty may, both Lawe and order break; Command his wil, rob, spoile, outrage and beate. And none that dare, with vengeance once him threat. Til death appears, then thought of former sin, That neuer ends, his torment doth begin. I wish man would, this morral Rule but heede: The end is that, that maketh Fortune good. The thoght of death, more better thoughts would breed, VVhich certaine is, the ende of flesh and bloud: His worldly cups, would seem but dregs and mud: Ten thousand times he would contemplate thus: Nemo ante obitum beatus. No man on earth, in happy state doth liue: The Prince that rules, a thousand feares inclose: Enuy, the Peere ful many a check doth geue. The Magistrate for cares can scarce repose: The Soldyar standes in danger of his foes. The Lawyers gayne is bought with toyle inough. A paynful life, is following of the plough. For Adams fault, man with this curse is borne: He (vvretch) his bread, vvith svveat of brovve shal eate, Not meant that al should worke as men forlorne: But that al sorts with toyle, or care, should svveat. Their mindes should moyle, vvhose hands are smooth &amp; neat VVhich felt, and vvaide, vvhat vvise man vvil not crie: Vt essem Christo, cupio dissolui. His most godly end.VVith this aduise, his flesh he mortified, And to his soule such comfort he profest: As those vvhich savve hovv Christianly he dyed: Admyr'd to heare, the Scripture he exprest. The good Deane of Paules, in his funerall sermon.The Deane of Paules, thus openly confest. Though Glorius fame, his mortal Combats crowne, His fight with death, was far of more renowne. He tooke a most honorable and prudent order in the disposement disposement of his worldly causes.Yet ere he dyed, that none should him misfame: His worldly vvil, he made vvith such regard: As for his debtes, vvas order in the same. He vvild, that none should of their due bee barde. His seruants paynes, he nobly did revvarde. VVhich done (qd. he) vvhen death he savve to prease: Vaine world farewel, my soule thee leaues in peace. Thus godly he, did end his noble life. VVhose losse is vvayl'd, vvith many vvatry eyen, VVhile vvorld doth last, vvhose fame vvil here be rife, VVhose soul in heau?, vvhose Corse the tomb doth shrine VVhose vertuous deedes, in good mens brests doe shine. And therefore iust, that euery eye may see: VVhereas he liues, this Epitaph should be. An Epitaph vpon the death of the most noble Lord Thomas Earle of Sussex, Vicount Fytz-water, Lord of Egremount, and Burnell. &amp;c. Heare vnder lies Syr Thomas Ratclife knight, Of Sussex Earle, and many honors moe. VVhose vertues oft, put enuy vnto flight, VVhose knightly force, both Fraunce and England know, True to his prince, and euer had bene so. To hawty to craue, ready stil to giue, Image of grace while he on earth did liue. Viuit post funera virtus.</field>
