      <field name="fulltext">[THE SPACIOUS TIMES] THE NEW PISGAH Methought I heard the passionate heart of Man Crying for revelation. The still, small Voice, that every listening soul hears call, Bids or forbids, but never tells the plan Of human life; the process that began Millions of years ago, the rise and fall Of nations, conflict of religions, all The vast vicissitude's unfinished span. Now have the Seven Angels blown their loud Trumpets and poured on Earth their vials of woe; The sea is blood; the sun wrapped in a shroud. Is this the crisis of the ascending, slow Anguish of Man? The summit, where the cloud Shall hide no more the Promised Land below? 1915. EPHPHATHA I would, my Country, that your mind were cleared To see with keen imaginative eyes Reality, undimmed by filmy lies Fanatic or political, nor bleared By native fogs of custom, long endeared To those who hate prevision; then would rise Before your gaze majestical surmise Of the war's meaning, which has long appeared To Prussia's other foes, but yet are hid This hour from you; because so long you lay Encrusted like a buried chrysalid, Closed from the living light by walls of clay; Now summoned by the trump of doom and bid To watch God out of darkness making day. May, 1916. “THE SPACIOUS TIMES” Oh for the sovereign days of good Queen Bess, Her government, its force and strength of will Against her enemies, her steadfast skill To baffle them and bring them to distress! With varying winds of Politics or Press, On devious course we veer; or else (worse ill, If worse there be) we stagnate in a still Ocean of doubt, in stately helplessness. But if the Faery Queen could come to reign And choose her Council of the men who act, We should be sure of war not waged in vain, Nor homes made empty nor the cataract Of blood poured out for nothing; she again Would countervail the Hanseatic Pact. June, 1916. TO THE BELGIANS Your gratitude to us? You owe us none; For how could we refuse to bring you aid, Or consolation for the price you paid For all the noble things that you have done? You bore the bitter brunt, and might have won, Had we been ready; you the foe delayed While we our tardy preparation made, And all alone you fought the frantic Hun. But when the end shall be and peace proclaimed, When the colossal Victory is crowned, Then, among all the nations the most famed, You, though the smallest, shall be surely found Chief of the greatest, and your courage named Among the glories that the world astound. December, 1915. TO AMERICA ALOOF A boundless prairie, full of laughing wheat, A lake that joins the limit of the sky, Gigantic rivers, mountains huge and high, Great harbours, with their merchant freight and fleet, Great cities, where each market-place and street With trade are cumbered—these astound the eye With splendour and the mind can purify From meaner thought, the nobler thought to greet. Why, then, since this magnificence is yours, Cannot you comprehend with insight true The conflict which your kindred race endures In Freedom's cause, a cause once dear to you? Alas, luxurious safety oft allures The clearest vision from an honest view. March, 1916. TO AMERICA AT WAR The greatest nations of the Earth, Of the English-speaking race, Have well remembered of their birth And taken heart of grace To fight their common foe, the Beast Who raised his horns on high And thought to conquer West and East And all the world defy. Between the twain great waters rolled, And, though they were akin, One was the New and one the Old; Yet, Liberty to win, They both had fought a strenuous fight And once each other fought; So now for Honour and for Right They Right and Honour sought. Great Britain first was in the field, And fame and glory won; She stood for France, a steadfast shield Against the invading Hun; America long held aloof; 'Twas hidden from her mind That she must fight the Cloven Hoof, The Enemy of mankind. But when she learned the truth at last, There was no long delay; She mustered all her force, and fast She armed her for the fray; America, to thee all hail! No more to say farewell, We, of one kindred, shall avail Against these fiends of Hell; Ay, and to hurl them back again To whence they came at first, To sear the world with nameless pain, By cruelties accurst; To hurl them back and bolt them in, That they no more assail; Theirs be the punishment of sin; America, all hail! July, 1917. PER DOMUM AD DEUM Dim are the days; not to the outward sight, But to the inward vision dim, obscure, Fraught with the sense of all things insecure, Of mountains moving, seas advancing, light Itself ambiguous, as in ancient fight With demon darkness. Will our homes endure, Or will the Abomination foul their pure Altars, where now the fragrant fire burns bright? Yet some there are, perchance from love of fame Professing loftier morals, who condemn The love of home and country, crying shame On all who love not God alone. To them Martha and Mary would have been to blame, And Jesus weeping o'er Jerusalem. 1916. TO AN ANTI-COMPULSION DEMAGOGUE Cheap-jack of words, purveyor of false thought, You higgle-haggle while your comrades die; “Men and munitions” was their bitter cry; You gave them neither; but one thing you sought— To keep the power that with your tongue you bought; Yes, for you sold yourself; the mob will buy Your clap-trap always, always pay your lie With the applause you love. Your brethren fought At Mons and on the Marne, or by the sea, Near where the tides race roaring down the strait, Past the bare mountains of Gallipoli; For you and yours they fought; O fool ingrate, Would curs like you, unworthy to be free, Might feel the fury of the Prussian hate! January, 1916. TO THE STRIKERS You bring dishonour on the British race, You, traitors to your country, by a deed Of unimagined meanness. Britons breed Few men like you, thank God; for your disgrace Shadows the land and darkens every face With shame that your unmitigated greed Should think to profit by your brethren's need, Whose bravery but serves to make you base. How the heart sickens that these things are done In this black passage of the world's dim way, Now when the streams of France and Belgium run Red with the blood of those whom you betray, Now when the Powers of Darkness smite the sun, And Force and Freedom close in final fray. THE STRIKE ON THE CLYDE The Iser once rolled red with blood, With blood the Meuse was dyed, But black dishonour stains the flood For ever of the Clyde. A PREACHER OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION Why do we tolerate this traitor? Why Suffer this gas-bag to pollute the air And take poor lads and weaklings unaware? He is more noisome than the meanest spy Shot at the Tower, who dared at least to die In service of his country; but no care Has this man for his Motherland; why spare Cowards who propagate a treasonous lie? Liar he is, true to his party creed; Being no fool, he knows, howe'er he rave, That Prussia's brutal and outrageous greed, Her arrogant ambition to enslave The world, alone have caused the war. What need Has Britain of this arrant caitiff knave? TO THE PACIFISTS So you would make the sacrifices vain, The sorrow void; let all that wealth of woe Be wasted, and the Prussian murderers go Unpunished. See, the thick-sown fields of slain And wandering coffin-waters of the main Teem forth the dead, who, in procession slow Passing before you, cry, “We fought the foe, Defending you and yours; we died to gain Safety for you; now (base ingratitude!) You pule and palter for a futile peace, Before the enemy for peace has sued: First bind him fast and let him pray release, Enforcing terms no cunning can elude; Only that way can you make war to cease.” THE CONSCIENTIOUS SHIRKER Would you the Scribes and Pharisees have braved, Knowing the death that afterwards they urged? Would you the money-lending thieves have scourged Out of the Temple? Would you not have saved Your life by lying, when the High Priest craved To hear the truth? When Pontius Pilate purged His hands from blood, would no appeal have surged From your pale heart, nor your pale lips have raved With supplication? Strive no more to hide Your cowardice with words, however great The authority; for deeds alone provide The great example; Christ, who chose his fate, To die for spiritual freedom, died That men might try his life to imitate. TO ENGLAND When the agony is done and you are free To lay aside the sword, when all but those Who died to save you from your ruthless foes Come home, what will you be? Will you be honest with yourself at last, And look the world full in its ugly face, Unboastful of your goodness and your grace, When this ordeal is past? Will you have judgment, with clear, pain-purged sense, To weigh things in the balance? Some that seem Of large significance will kick the beam, Like coins of false pretence; Others, in aspect dull, with no display To tempt ambition, will draw down the scale, However counterpoised; and not for sale At any cost are they. Why do you suffer anguish? Not for forms Religious or political you care Now; but for Freedom, and your Homes you dare To brave these storms. Keep then in sight what war has made you see; Think no small thoughts again; not faint nor far Shines, like the star of Bethlehem, your star Of glorious destiny. TO GREAT BRITAIN If thou forget again, as in thy day Of proud prosperity thou didst forget, The things belonging to thy peace, regret Will not avail thee for thy strength and stay, When all thy greatness shall have passed away And thou among thine enemies art set, Like Samson, for derision; with thy debt Of vengeance due, but with no power to pay. Cast not aside thine armour or thy sword, When thou hast won the fight; the foe has sworn To humble thee, because thou art the Lord Of Ocean and of thee was Freedom born; All wilt thou lose for which thy fathers warred, If thou again thy prophets dare to scorn. December, 1915. WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE Hereafter, when the dread ordeal is past, What shall we be? Before, we were a race Torn by internal quarrels, with no grace Of large imagination, to forecast A destiny made fair by holding fast The custom of our ancestors, to face Stern facts; if we should abdicate our place In the great world again, 'twould be the last Of our stupidities. Forbearing Fate Upholds the level scales, with pitying smile, Which carry, on one side, our folly's weight; His patience on the other; yet, some while, The judge must cease to be compassionate, If we persist in adding to our pile. THE CAUSE Though men are sad, when they at last confess That they have grown too agéd to do aught But warm themselves and dream of all they wrought Ere Time condemned them to loathed idleness, More sad is he (although his years be less, Too old for arms) who never has been taught To help his Home-land; most in need when caught In dragon jaws of war and war's distress. When Peace descends with healing on her wings For all the wounds of Prussian perfidy, Let British children learn to do the things That make an Empire One and keep it Free; So every generation, as it springs To power, devoted to that Cause shall be. A NATIONAL ANTHEM I wish, my Country, I could make a song That all who truly love you would delight To sing and sing again. The men who fight For home and honour, as they march along Would peal it forth; and often, clear and strong, Voices of boys and maidens would unite To chorus it and celebrate your might In grapple with foul fraud and cruel wrong. Once in Provence I heard the approaching sound Of a great multitude. I turned my gaze On the long road, where up the hill they wound, Peasants en fête; then burst a song in praise Of valour from their lips; the fair French ground Trembled for pleasure; 'twas the Marseillaise. TO LORD KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM Britain awaits your word; for you alone, Now in the time when her best sons have bled For Liberty, she trusts; you were not bred In Casuistry's Temple, and you own Allegiance but to God and to the Throne And to your Country. Now the wounded, dead, And maimed, whose blood for Britain has been shed, Demand the harvest that their blood has sown. Widows and stricken mothers bid you send The reapers forth, still hoping your command That not in vain should come to such an end The lives they loved. Oh, Sir, lift up your hand And signal, “Now must every man defend (If he have strength) his home and native land.” November, 1915. LORD KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM How shall our half-dumb sorrow raise an ode Or elegy, expressive of this death? The great catastrophe is like a load That weighs upon the heart and chokes the breath. He was the man most trusted in the land; In his clear nature there was no dim light, He knew how to obey and to command; Learning the obligation gave the right. Obedience to duty was his gauge To measure life; by that he measured men; Have not the brave and wise in every age By that same virtue wielded sword and pen? Beneath that blood-stained sea of wreck, where still The battleships of Britain, masters, ride, He sank; may his indomitable will Live on in us, and govern us and guide. EDITH CAVELL Never to be forgotten is this deed Of vilest villainy; fanatic Spain Would scarce have done it, in her days of vain Glory; 'tis fouler than the foulest fee'd Assassination Kings have e'er decreed, To prop a tottering throne. What deeper stain Can dye a nation's honour? She was slain Because she pitied those in pity's need. Brave martyr to thy faith in that fine skill And careful faculty of doing good Which fiends deride, who only love to kill, But which in heaven, divinely understood, Has jealous friends, God bring thy foes to ill, Confound their counsels and avenge thy blood. October, 1915. TO THE LADIES OF ENGLAND Fine furs and flounces, frills and furbelows, Fine plumes and velvet, broideries and lace, Fine frocks for figure and fine hats for face; For such extravagance the money flows, As if our battles could be won by clo'es; And finery flaunted in a public place Or pictured in the press is no disgrace, Though Britain writhes with pain of wounds and woes. Now while the grip of war the realm doth hold, Now, once for all, this waste repudiate, Not by the specious argument cajoled Of large employment lost; anticipate The time when vanities no more are sold And every farthing shall be big with fate. THE FASHION PLATE Shame on you, ladies, who, for love of praise Or some fair rival's frock to emulate, Study the meretricious Fashion Plate Or send to Paris for the newest craze Of costume; other thoughts, and other ways Of spending wealth, the dreadful hours dictate, And Death alone, in crimson robes of State, Should win the worship of the public gaze. But if you wish to show the world good sense, Design a national vesture; such a robe Of simple folds as once the Grecian dame And then the Roman deemed magnificence, Being their mark of birth; o'er all the globe Bear you like emblem of Great Britain's fame. THE USE OF WAR Whene'er, the final battle won, Excursions and alarms are over, We may be sure the usual sun Will gild the wheat and dye the clover, And whatsoe'er the war may bring Of loss or lesson you or me-ward, 'Tis safe to say the birds will sing And every river ripple seaward. Whate'er our armies may have had, Both owls and mice will have their rations, And not a weasel be more sad For all the madness of the nations; Imperial Nature will proceed In just the same old-fashioned manner, And send her legions forth to feed And fight for food beneath her banner. From Nature's force all forces flow, So Man must needs obey her orders; Although he fancies long ago He broke her bonds and crossed her borders, In fact he wanders round and round And vainly lights his feeble tapers. To see his way beyond the ground Where she compels his clownish capers. And therefore, do you think, my friend, That when at last our foes go under, The follies of our blood will end And we no more shall boast and blunder? Do you suppose that to a plane Of life more high and intellectual Britain will suddenly attain, When she has made her arms effectual? No; Nature, as I apprehend, Leads us to waste our breath on chatter, Our eyes on glittering gauds, and spend Our strength on things that do not matter, Till, lest we sink, no more to rise, She stops our blathering and our blinking With a new war (that old surprise) And sets us for a while a-thinking. THE THAMES I River the best beloved of all that flow, Whom spires of Oxford, towers of London crown, River of England's record and renown, Under the Bridge of Henley coiling slow, Thy sunny waters bear away the woe Of this world-wasting epoch; carried down Beneath thy silvery tide, forebodings drown, And hopes from thy calm deeps, like lilies, grow. Upon thy neighbouring hills encamped the Dane, The Saxon and the Roman; Normans raised Their strongholds on thy banks; but not again Shall the marauder master thee; amazed, The hordes of Rhineland reel; and, God be praised, Thy holy places never shall profane. II But had the Huns profaned thee, and thy waves By them had been befouled—oh, ye who prate Of making peace, while yet our Empire's fate Hangs balanced in that wilderness of graves, Where still the wild destroyer roams and raves, The Wolf of Prussia that no blood can sate, Think you your homes would not be desolate, Your wives not ravished, nor your offspring slaves? Are ye then cowards, hypocrites, or fools? And which are we, who bear with you? Your friends Are murderous brigands, in whose very schools Is taught a savage creed: a race that rends Attested treaties, for its wicked ends, And with an iron rod the conquered rules. III But let me float upon thy flood again, Forgetting all this horror; thou dost flow With the same loveliness as long ago, When in the flush of youth, unfraught with pain, I sculled my skiff, beside the grassy plain Of Chertsey Mead, to Pentonhook, where grow The flowering rushes; or would often row To Boveney, from the royal Saint's domain. Now are thy bordering gardens all aglow With trellised roses; where thy stream bends round At Shiplake and at Wargrave, there they blow In clusters, and on Bisham's haunted ground; Thither upon thy bosom will I go; To restful scenes add thou thy soothing sound. IV I crossed the Roman Bridge that spans thy tide, Belovéd Thames, at Sonning; loveliest far Of all the lovely villages there are, Clustered along thy banks; it is the pride Of all the cottagers who there abide; For every porch the clematis doth star, Each lattice has its flowers in jug or jar, With roses on the wall on either side. I paused to lean upon the parapet And watch thee seaward glide; a boat drew nigh, Crowded with those brave men who pay the debt Of duty to their country; like to die Many had been—maimed, wounded, blind—and I, Beholding, knew I never could forget. June, 1918. THE DAWN Watchman, what of the night? Alas, the night Stretches beyond the war; though peace be nigh, In vain the sun shall clamber up the sky, The moaning Earth turn vainly, seeking light, Except the Prussian Satan, God of Might, Be bound in chains. If not, conspiracy, The hollow promise, and the specious lie Will conquer Freedom in some future fight. For there live men within our Island wall Are traitors; creatures swollen with the pride Of their own speculations; deeming all Bright surface depth, and everything beside Their own thoughts false; deaf to their Country's call, Being to their own trumpeter in thrall. November, 1918. THE JUDGMENT OF JEHU Just as a fisherman doth watch his float, So mark the Prussians the result of guile; Their bait, an armistice. Oh, scorn the wile! Or still on dreams of honour do we dote? They have no honour; 'tis from them remote As mercy is; first let them reconcile Their souls with God, whose altars they defile; They whine because the sword is at their throat. By their false friendship, by their hidden hate, Their perjured word, their infamous decrees, By Belgium pillaged, France made desolate, Torture of prisoners, murder on the seas, Old folk and babies butchered, and the fate Of women—smite them, smite them to their knees. November, 1918. NOVEMBER 11, 1918 The war is done, The shouts begun, And all the flags are flying; And far away across the sea The dead are lying. Many a wife Is weary of life And many a maid is weeping, Fathers and mothers think of sons For ever sleeping. The churches raise Their hymns of praise For victory completed, But there is many a one whose joy Death has defeated. Though bells may chime The glorious time, Some folk cannot be cheerful, They mourn the past or else are of The future fearful. But not in vain Those men were slain, And death is not their ending; They loved the land their grandsires loved And died defending. In us they live, And we must give Full measure of our powers, Lest wasted be their sacrifice For want of ours. By their dead hand Our work was planned; Now lay the firm foundations, And build Great Britain up anew, The wonder of the nations. A BALLAD OF MONS Thunder not back their words of hate, But thunder with your guns; Press on, press on to Berlin's gate, The Paris of the Huns. They first deceived themselves and then The whole wide world, except A handful of brave British men, Who woke while others slept. “Arouse, arise,” they cried, “beware The Prussians' cultured creed; World-masters they would be; prepare For you will soon have need.” But Britain was absorbed in trade, In politics and sports; What foeman can the land invade Whose navy guards her ports? She thought herself secure; she scorned The warning of her sons, Whose wise experience should have warned Against the wiles of Huns. She listened to the lawyer crew, Themselves the men of wiles, Who covered up the thing they knew, Or did not know, with smiles. Until there came a day at last When she was brought to bay; Her honour hung upon the cast Of what she dared to say. Thank God, the honest word she said; Her Empire heard the call; The coward hopes of some were sped Who wished to see her fall: Fall from the high estate of those Sworn enemies of wrong, Who fight for friends against their foes, The weak against the strong. St. Andrew and St. Patrick scanned St. George's flag unfurled Against the Dragon who had planned To swallow up the world. The skirling pipes of Scotland blew, Widespread the war's alarms, And far across the ocean flew Great Britain's call to arms. Ireland renewed her fighting fame, All civil conflict past, In strong array her young men came From Dublin and Belfast. Australia heard the bugles sound, And Canada replied; Implying also Newfoundland. New Zealand, too, by blood was bound To fight by Britain's side. Then India's ancient land was stirred; From Cashmere to Mysore, From Sind to Bengal's Bay she heard The summons to the war. Although diverse in blood and creed, She marched the foe to face, And proved herself in Britain's need Of one imperial race. But Prussia sent her armies forth; With all her subject States She crossed the frontiers, South and North, And broke the Belgian gates; In spite of her own hand and seal, In solemn compact given, That never by invader's steel Should Belgium's gates be riven. Through Flanders then with fire and sword, No lust nor loot forbid, She rushed; and all the things abhorred Of God and man she did. She swept like storm from town to town; Cathedral, Palace, Hall, Each pile of beauty and renown, Before the whirlwind fall. No altar, crucifix, or shrine Was sacred in her eyes; Three things alone she deemed divine— Herself, her lust, and lies. Then did the Belgians drink the cup Of death and deep despair; Their homes in flame were swallowed up And all their land laid bare. Trading and labouring men were haled To death or worse duress, And mothers for their children wailed, And babes were motherless. Daughters were ravished, fathers made To kneel before the foe That outraged them; not soon shall fade The memory of their woe! Old men were slaughtered, women too; Their bodies were defamed; The Huns did all that devils do And did it unashamed. For young and old was no escape; The Huns destroyed the land, And murder, pillage, arson, rape Marched with them hand in hand. But still the Belgians and their King Like heroes fought the foe, And eagles wounded in the wing Are forced to fly more slow. No nation in unequal fight Of braver deeds can boast, Alone they stood against the might Of all the Prussian host, Till Britain's forces o'er the sea Came, guarded by her fleet; Too few to win a victory, They won a great retreat! For though the surging Prussians drove From Mons to Compiègne The British Army, yet they strove To conquer it in vain; Yet ill had fared the Western world Had Russia dealt no blow; Her onslaught, chivalrously hurled, Distraught the boastful foe; So, when the French made fierce attack, With Britons, side by side, They forced the Prussians back and back And turned the threatening tide. If Britain then had had the men, A million in the field, The Huns' retreat had been defeat And death, or else to yield; But Britain never knows her day; Locked in her little isles, She lets the little things have sway At which the great world smiles. Yet now the foe their match had found, Though matched at dreadful cost; Like moles they burrowed underground, The road to Paris lost. Then did the British and the French, From Alsace to the coast, With gun to gun and trench to trench Hold back the Prussian host; But not without the Russians' aid; They too held Prussia fast; And little Servia from Belgrade The Austrian Army cast; While still the British Navy kept The ocean channels free, And like a watch-dog never slept At sentry o'er the sea. Then grew the Prussian Eagle mad; Where was his promised Day; Why were not Paris, Petrograd, And London now his prey? German professors raised a cry And waved astonished hands That anyone should dare defy Great Prussia's high commands; And grave philosophers declared, With spluttering and with spleen, That Britain was for war prepared: How villainous and mean! The Kaiser called upon his God; What kind of God was he? The Christ who once the Garden trod Of “pale Gethsemane”? More like, alas, a Fiend Divine, A horrible Afreet Or Moloch, asking blood for wine And babies' flesh for meat. For now their harpy aeroplanes Like demon falcons flew, And dropped their bombs on country lanes And country women slew; While cruisers, that the mists conceal From Britain's North Sea guard, Along the Yorkshire headlands steal And helpless towns bombard. A piteous sight it was to see The shells begin to rain; Mothers and children at their knee And agèd folk were slain; And many a home beloved by those Whose infants there were born Was crumbled into dust by foes Who all compassion scorn. Shame be to those who have command, To those who serve them shame, For deeds of murder done on land And deeds at sea the same! Unwarned, the merchantmen go down And sailors find their graves; Oh, long shall be their foul renown Who riot o'er the waves. Then hoist the British flag on high And nail it to the mast; Let all the world that sees it fly Know Britain roused at last. If e'er it flew for power or fame, Not now for them it flies, But to keep fair her ancient name Of faith to brave allies; To keep her honour clean and bright, Her kingdom undefiled By proud oppressor's foot; to fight For home and wife and child; To help to set the whole world free From Prussia's iron hand; To sweep the pirates from the sea, The brigands from the land. Now let the subtle tongue be still, The crafty counsel cease; War must be waged with all our will, Before we talk of peace. Men of plain mind shall rule the day, Not men of crooked thought; 'Tis time to argue of the fray, When once the fray is fought. Let all who think (as think they must, If sturdy sense not fail) That Britain's cause is right and just, Take heed that it prevail. Ah, let imagination paint, If paint it truly can, The advent of the Prussian Saint To teach uncultured Man! Could he succeed in conquering France, And then his way could wing And make on Britain his advance, What gospel would he bring? He holds the Faith of Violence, In force he puts his trust; If even a child give him offence, That child must bite the dust. Though hard such frenzy to believe, It is not hard of proof; Go, see where Rheims and Louvain grieve For homes without a roof, For churches now but funeral pyres, Proud splendours built in vain, For ravished women and grey sires And reverend Pastors slain; For babes and children too, bereft Of all that makes life sweet, And if not massacred, yet left To die in field or street. To repetition all comes round, And Prussian deeds the same, Until the whole wide world resound For ever with their shame. Though war be war, if war must be, With all its waste and woe, 'Twas waged with magnanimity An hundred years ago; Nor yet was chivalry unknown, When France bowed down her head To Prussia, and the land was sown With all her honoured dead. But if the Huns on British shore Should land (which God forbid) They'd do to us as much or more Than they to Belgium did. Picture their deeds and tears shall start From every honest eye, And horror in each honest heart In execration cry: “Though all the flower of life we lose, Our dearest and our best, This is the way, the way we choose, To bring us peace and rest: “To beat this monster to his knees, And bind him with a chain, Lest he and his barbarities Should plague the world again; “Lest he should spread his noisome growth To hide us from the sun, And we, rewarded by our sloth, Lose all our fathers won. “On Freedom's altar was their blood Poured out, and not in vain, Unless we let the Prussian flood Wash out that sacred stain; “Unless, forgetting old renown, We cease brave days to greet, When Drake set sail from Plymouth town, To fight the Spanish fleet; “When that great victory Nelson won With his own death was sealed, When back came conquering Wellington From Waterloo's red field; “Such heroes must we oft recall, That we may keep alive A flame to animate us all, That we like them may strive; “Strive that our goodly heritage Be handed to our sons, Secure from the rapacious rage And ruthless rule of Huns.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OTHERS THE CELANDINE Bright woodland buttercup, whose burnished leaves Set forth the foremost promise of the year, Still art thou dear to me, as thou wert dear Ere Time had grieved my heart as now he grieves, When memory in thy golden mirror weaves Far faces of the dead and brings them near; Yet still I love thee, the first flower to hear Earth stir, asleep since last she bound her sheaves. The soft wind sighs along the sandy lane, Where now the thrush, with hesitating note, Cons o'er and o'er his part in that full strain Which soon from forest, field, and mead will float; And there thou shinest, knowing not my pain, And here I ponder, from thy joy remote. THE DERWENT Dear pebbly river, flowing West, To find at last thy rest, Would I might launch a coracle on thee And float down to the sea. How beautiful thou art in all thy ways! Thy moving, murmuring maze Fills the young mind with contemplation sweet And thoughts as fair and fleet. Thou didst inspire me in boyhood's hours, Thou and thy autumn flowers, Thy boulders making musical thy stream, Thy alder-darkened gleam, Thy many-channelled pastures, where the cows For thee forget to browse, And in thy cool, clear current stand knee-deep, Cud-chewing, half asleep— Thou and whate'er is thine—thy happy birds, That well-nigh warble words, Thy trout, that leap to show their dappled skin, Thy gauze-winged flies, that spin In giddy reel, all their one sunny day, Thy starry weeds that sway Obedient to thy motion—ah! dear stream, Thy magic made me dream Of life like thee, beneficent, with pure Intention making sure Of destiny divine. Now on thy brink No eager thoughts I think; But in my pensive memory looking back Along life's traversed track, I see thee almost as a thing of sense, A sacred influence. Matlock Bath. September 27, 1917. TO OUR DEAD CANARY Dear little elfin bird, we miss thee more Than foolish pride is willing to confess; Thy empty cage reminds us o'er and o'er Of winsome ways that craved our tenderness. There didst thou sing thy ditties clear and bright, To keep our thoughts uplifted to the sky And bathe it ever in the heavenly light, Whereto, methinks, thou finally didst fly. No blither song did ever lark trill out, To banish fear with his delightful lay, (The fear of death or that more dismal doubt Of love) than thou didst give us, day by day. Where art thou singing now, sweet fairy friend? Thy pretty, pitiful body was left here, But not with it thou camest to an end; Somewhere thy notes are sounding, bright and clear. Somewhere, uncaged, and yet from danger free, Thou joinest the thanksgiving in that place Which is the bourne of choristers like thee, Where every creature is fulfilled with grace. THE REMNANTS Of all life's joys and sorrows most have flown; But two remain: The sadness when you leave me lone, The pleasure when you come again. EPIGRAM [No, marriage never will go out of fashion] “Will marriage become more unpopular?” —Sunday Herald. No, marriage never will go out of fashion; To crow o'er others is the woman's passion; She loves, when past the matrimonial wicket, In the outsider's face to wave her ticket. TO OSCAR BROWNING (On his Eighty-first Birthday) Some send you verses; yet inadequate, Though honest in intention, to express Your life, its meaning and its steadfastness Of purpose, in the face of adverse fate: Many there are who owe to you their state Of blessed knowledge of the things that bless, And none to you have ever owed distress, Though oft distressed yourself by vulgar hate. Because this thing most commonly appears, That anyone to whom a guiding star Beams down a friendly ray is doomed to tears; For those who wander are intent to mar That consolation. Yet you felt few fears And still are beckoned by the light afar. MAY, 1917 The may has flowered; the spring is here; And in this happy time of year I, like the birds, will sing my dear. I love her so that my distress Is, knowing that she loves me less, My love for her she cannot guess. The birds are mating; would that we Were mating too; the seasons flee; Our time of mating we shall see Never again; yet my desire Is far more poignant than the fire Of passion, soon now to expire. I would our spirits might caress And of their union could express A world-enchanting loveliness. OTHER DAYS Hang up my guns and my bat and my rod On the opposite wall. I can sit here and dream Of the woods and the turf and the banks I have trod, The hazel-clad banks of the far-winding stream. On a bright autumn morn would we oft sally forth When the coverts were burnished and bronzed by the breath Of the first wintry breezes that blew from the North And whispered of sleep, cold and pallid as death. We moved through a fairy-land, ere the frost came To bare the green branches; the foliage was bright With yellow and russet and red, and the flame Of the sun, daily shining with leveller light. Then out to the fields in the open we hied, Where far o'er the swedes and the stubble there lay, And far o'er the stretch of the fair country-side, The South Downs to seaward, in stately array. And how did my comrades these pleasures enhance! What holiday hearts did I have with me then! The smile, the gay word and encouraging glance, That told of the faith and the friendship of men. So, not wanton in sport, but as eager to trace The glamour of pasture and woodland and plough, Our hearts were unconsciously touched by the grace That lightens the eyes and unwrinkles the brow. Until, when the sun was beginning to wane, With Westering glories above Whetham Hill, We turned to my mother's old homestead again, By Rother, the river, by Rother the rill. For though the fair stream is a river by name, It looks but the width of a rain-swollen beck; But the gold-bellied trout are the proof of its fame, As they dart through the dapple, the shade and the fleck. How often in summer I wandered along The root-tangled verge, with its fringe of tall flowers, While the lark thrilled the sky with his mystical song, That ne'er was invented in this world of ours. I beguiled the shy trout with my rod and my line, And when I succeeded was glad of my skill, But the joy of the lifted-up heart that was mine Was the song of the birds and the laugh of the rill. Or else, with the love of adventure possessed, When the morning of cricket appeared, I arose, In glad emulation and innocent zest To spend the long day, till its cool, dewy close. When the blood is a-tingle with sunshine and air, And the sky's blessed azure shines over your head, How far seems the onslaught of ravaging care, How long ere the roses of youth shall be dead! 'Tis the monarch of games; both the eye and the will Are subject, and discipline rules the whole man, Good fellowship too, and the patience of skill, The courage to dare and the quickness to plan. But though heedful endeavour to cricket be due, In spaces of leisure the soul may range free, And soar like the lark in his vast cage of blue, Or sing like the thrush on his perch of green tree. Had I magic to capture a day from the past, To no spell of ambition or love would I yield, But choose when the beeches were dropping their mast, And the wickets were pitched on the old Stodham field. See my brave boys from Liss! They arrive with a cheer; And with Fraser to bat and with Bridger to bowl We should lower the banner of proud Haslemere; So then set to, my lads, with your heart and your soul! But who is it walks in the quivering shade Of the silvery poplars, and copper-beech trees? 'Tis my mother, dear soul, who this venture has made, The players to greet and the neighbours to please. The Shepherd Divine of her favourite psalm Now leads her by pastures eternally green, Beside the still waters, eternally calm; Yet I think she forgets not her Stodham demesne. But now am I summoned; the Haslemere team Are keen for their innings and I must away— (Do you know Haslemere, where the distances dream And shimmer in sunshine, the long summer day? A place of more charm you may search for in vain, For not even can Stonor, that looks down on Steep, With its leaf-latticed road, where the lumbering wain Creaks, labouring up to the pastures of sheep On the juniper down-land, from which you may spy Butser Hill, with a scoop of the Isle of Wight sea— Not even can Stonor with Haslemere vie In delicate grandeur of dainty degree.) But long ere we wish it, the sun has declined, And the moment has come for the stumps to be drawn; Whether winners or losers, we still bear in mind That a cricket day fades for another to dawn. Yet the destinate moment in vain would we shun, When we bowl the last ball and we score the last hit, And the chivalrous contest and generous fun Are for others; but we with the watchers must sit. Then hang up my rod and my bat and my gun, They shine with the mellow moonlight of the past, I can sit here and dream of the days that are done, In the sadness of joys that have vanished so fast. THE WILDERNESS OF PAIN I bear my agony alone, None can come near me in my pain, A million miles my heart has flown Across distress's dismal plain. I wander free, but freedom means All that I hate; for that dear face With its wan pallor fills the scene's Dim distance with a dreadful grace. Companion of my passionate years, The desert doubly desert seems, Because I see thee, through my tears, A mirage, or a thing of dreams. HER CHARACTER She's not as many women are, Whose pleasure is their creed, She does not hide her soul afar From any human need. She loves to be a Fairy Queen And dress in fairy dress, Yet keeps beneath the glittering sheen A great unworldliness. She loves to laugh, she loves to hear Another laugh, but yet Within her spirit is a fear, A passionate regret. A secret fear that she has been Averse from others' woes: But let him speak who most has seen And best her goodness knows. There never was, nor ever will In this world be again, A creature of so great a skill To heal another's pain. Wherever she may find her place, When this poor life is done, She will have power to turn her face Toward the Eternal Sun. THE GHOST The feast was set, the guests were there, The flags and holly gay, And over all, with goodly glare, The lamps illumed the array, While music's fanfarade and blare Blew dismal thought away. It was the time when Christ was born, The War was at an end, The magic of that Sacred Morn Had bidden us attend, Not without thought of those forlorn Of husband, son, or friend. We drank the toast, we sang the song, And each to each replied To that old greeting that so long Has graced the Christmas-tide, And for an hour the suffered Wrong Of life was put aside. Yet there was one, who in that crowd Seemed blither than them all, Within whose heart, persistent, loud, Rang Pain's incessant call; For she to whom his heart had bowed Was near to be Death's thrall. A PIOUS WISH I would that I might live my life again; Not to escape from sin or wrong or thrall Of false opinion, nor from mental pain Or physical (for these afflict us all), Nor to live longer, with more chance to use These teachings and their pointed path to choose. No, with more modest purpose I would wend Through vital horror, villainies and woes, Humiliation, sorrow without end, And wasted work and joys that ever close The door behind them, where we vainly knock, When they have passed and turned the triple lock! Once more the body's ills would I endure, And the worse spirit's; face the haunted dark Of knowledge, chasing what is never sure, Or pressing forward to some lanthern mark Of aspiration, looking like a star, That guides our feet fallaciously afar. These would I bear again, if I might dwell In my own ancestors' secluded grange, Whose architectural symmetry would tell Of homely love and faith that does not change, The natural expression in design Of pride in native land and ancient line. Though I would wish to see upon one side A prospect stretching far o'er woods and vales, With perhaps a glimpse of ocean, where his tide Meets the great river's mouth, and bulging sails; And here and there church towers, to help renew From point to point the eager vision's view. No vast estate should cumber me; some cows Should roam below the terraces at will, But there no stately stag or doe should browse, No gaudy peacock on the lawn should shrill; For I would dwell there with a modest mien, Nor think my mansion grander than the scene. There oft with cottage folk would I consort, Not to be patron, but to learn their lore Of high humility and lowly port Of dignity (by which they set no store), Unconsciously deep-founded on the sense That labour has its own proud precedence. So in my common pilgrimage to death, With music, books, and friends, and some stern task Of poetry, I'd draw my quiet breath, Nor ever from ambition would I ask Reward, but honestly my thought would say, Content with my own conscience day by day. And should I be accused that civic right Brings civic duty, I would answer thus: “True is the obligation and not light That we should honour laws which honour us, But still some gentle spirits lose the grace Of their clear nature, in a public place.” THE WISEST MAN Of all the men whom I should wish to meet In that uncharted region, vague and vast, Whither the wingéd seasons bear me fast, I would choose him whom Plato used to meet In the cool porches or the pillared street Of Athens, arguing with all who passed, Whether they loved or feared the iconoclast Who smote the hollow gods of their conceit. Would he could come among us here to-day, Holding us spellbound by his questioning, Until we went crestfallen on our way, Perceiving we knew nothing of the thing Of which we prated; like the priests who sing The praise of gods that are but common clay. THE SHADOW OF DEATH Are pregnant winter and restoring sleep True images of death? The dormouse lies Stiffened in slumber, cold as when it dies, While snowy winds o'er field and woodland sweep; Yet would no man for his beloved weep, Though fallen in such a trance; because her eyes Would open again, like violets, when the skies Grow blue and through the dell warm zephyrs creep. There are no images of death; the state That limits life we living cannot know; But we remember most our mortal fate, When parting from a friend, who, loth to go, Lingers; for then our saddened hearts foredate That ineluctable hour of presaged woe.</field>
