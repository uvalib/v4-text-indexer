And, for þat god of his gret grace Will, his pople in ilk a place Trow in thinges, þat er to come, Als in ded and þe day of dome, And how ilk man sall haue his mede, Be saued or dampned after þair dede: þarfor he schewes ensaumpels sere On þis mold omang vs here, To ger vs in oure trowth be stabill And lif in faith withowten fabill; And so he will vs wisely wys To kepe vs clene and com to blys. So it bifell in a sesoune Efter cristes incarnacioune A thowsand wynter, be yhe bald, And thre hundreth, als clerkes tald, And þareto thre and twenty yhere; þan bifell on þis manere In Alexty, a noble toune, þat thretty mylle es fro Bayoune, þe XII. kalend, als clerkes call, Of Decembre, als it gan fall, A gret burges, þat named was Gy, In þat same cete gan dy; And, when þe cors in erth was layd, þan was his gast full smertly grayd: Vnto his wyfe he went ogayne And suede hir with mykell payne. He did hir dole both day and nyght, Bot of him myght scho haue no sight, And in hir chaumber myght scho here Mikell noys and hydous bere, And oft scho was so rugged and rent, þat for sorow scho was nere schent. þus was scho turment in þat stede Eghtene days, after he was dede; And scho ne wist noght witerly, Whether it war þe gast of Gy Or it war fandyng of þe fende, þat so had soght hir for to schende. þarfore sone efter on a day Till þe freres scho toke þe way (þat prechours war of þat cete, Wele lyfand men of gud degre; And till þe pryor gan scho tell All þis ferly, how it bifell) On saint John day þe euangelyste, þe thred day after þe brithe of Criste. Scho tald vnto him lest and maste, How scho was greued with þe gaste, And how scho was sted in þat stede, Sen tyme þat hir husband was dede, And how scho hoped ryght wyterly, It was þe gast of hir lord Gy; For in þat chaumbre oft herd was he, Whare hir lord was wont to be; To spyll þat bed wald he noght blyn, þat Gy, hir lord, and scho lay in. ‘þarfor’, scho said with symple chere, ‘þat hows dar I no mare com nere; Bot hyder I come to ask counsaile, What thing myght in þis case auaile’. When þe pryor had herd þis case, Gret mournyng in his hert he mase; Bot, for scho suld noght be affrayd, Vnto þe woman þus he sayd: ‘Dame’, he said, ‘ne dred þe noght, For out of bale þou sall be broght; And haue na meruail in þi mynde Of cases, þat falles omang mankynde, Forwhi’, he said, ‘als kennes þir clerkes, God is wonderfull in his werkes; And wele I wate, þat he will now Ordayn som poynt for our prow To schew omang his seruandes dere Till þair helpyng, als men sall here; þarfor, dame, gyf þe noght ill, Bot be blythe and byde here styll. For to my brether I will a space To ask þair counsail in þis case; For omang many wytty men Som gud counsail may þai ken, And sykerer may it so be tane þan of a man bi him allane; Bot dame’, he said, ‘I sall noght dwell’. þan gert he ryng þe chapiter bell And gedyrd his brether all togyder, And, hastily when þai come þider, He declared þam all þis case, Als þe woman said, it wase, And prayd þam for to tell him to: ‘þarof what best es to do?’ Vnto þis tale þai tuke gud tent And ordaind be þair comon assent, þat þe pryor sone suld ga And with him other maisters twa (þe tone maister of geomettri And þe toþer of philisophi, þat wysest war in þair degre) Vnto þe mayre of þat cete To tell þis ilk auenture him tyll And pray him, if it war his will, þat he wald vouchesaue to send Som sertaine men with þam to wend To Gy hows, þat was newly dede, To se þa wonders in þat stede And to bere witnes of þaire dede And mayntene þam, if it war nede. And þus þai did with al þaire maine: þe woman was þareof ful fayne. When þe mayre had herd þis thing, Twa hundreth men sone gert he bring And armed þam fra top to ta And bad þam with þe pryor ga: ‘And baynly do, what he will byd!’ And, als he bad, ryght swa þai dyd. þe pryor bad þa men bidene, þat þai suld all be schryuen clene And here messe with deuocyoune And sithen baldly mak þam boune. And of requiem he sang a messe For cristen saules both more and lesse, And in his mynde þan toke he Gy And prayd for him full specially. And all, þat þan wald howsell take, He howsyld sone for godes sake, For þat þe fende suld noght þam fere Ne in þair dedes do þam no dere. And þan þe pryor full preuely In a bost tok godes body Vnder his gere with gud entent: Bot na man wist, þat with him went. He and þe men and þe maisters twa Vnto Gy hows gon þai ga. þe armed men þan ordand he All obout þe hows to be Wele vmsett on ilk a syde To se, what auenture wald betyde: Som in þe wyndows and som in þe dore With wapen, þat war styf and store, And som in þe gardyns gert he lyg And som vpon þe howses ryg, And euer in ilk a place bot thre In takenyng of þe trinite; And, þus when þai war sett obout, He bad, þat þai suld haue no dout. þan entred he in to þat place, And his twa brether with him gase, And þir wordes he said in hy: ‘Pax huic domui!’ þat es on ynglysch þus to say: ‘Pese be to þis hows allway!’ To þe chaumber he went withouten rest, And haly water obout he kest With ‘Vidi aquam’ and þan said þus: ‘Veni, creator spiritus’ With þe colett, þat sall efter come, ‘Deus, qui corda fidelium’; And haly water eftsones kest he And said: ‘Asperges me, domine’. þan cald he þe wyfe withouten mare, And scho come wepand wonder sare. He said: ‘Dame, teche me to þe stede And to þe bed, whare Gy was dede’. þe woman was full mased and mad, Scho trembyld þan, so was scho rad; Vnto þe bed sone scho him tald, þe care was at hir hert full cald; Bot in hir wa yhit als scho was, Scho said: ‘Sir pryor, or yhe pas, I pray yhow for þe luf of me And als in dede of charyte, þat yhe wald byd som haly bede And mak prayers in þis stede For his saule, þat noble man’. And þan þe pryor þus bigan And said: ‘Dominus uobiscum’; His brether answerd all and som; And efterward he said onone þe fyrst gosspell of saint Jone (‘In principio’ clerkes it call). When it was said, þan satt þai all Doune on a burde þe bed besyde And said þe seruyce in þat tyde, þat for þe ded aw for to be, ‘Placebo’ with þe ‘Dirige’; And after ‘laudes’ þai said in hy þe seuen psalmes with þe letany; And, ‘Agnus dei’ when þai said thryse, þai herd an answer on þis wyse: A febyll voyce þan might þai ken Als of a child sayand: ‘Amen’. þarfor war þai all affraid, And þe pryor þusgate sayd: ‘I coniure þe, þou creature, In þe vertu of our saueoure, þat es a god of myghtes maste, Fader and son and haly gaste, þat was and es and sall be ay, þat þou me answer, if þou may, And tell me, what som I will craue, Als fer als þou may power haue’. And þan þe voyce with lodder bere Said to him on þis manere: ‘A, pryor, ask sone, what þou will, And I sall tell it þe vntyll, Als fer als I haue myght or mynde Or als I may haue leue be kynde’. þis ilk voyce þan herd þai all (þe armed men obout þe hall), And in þai come full fast rynand Ilk ane with wapen in þair hand; For wele it was in þair trowyng, þat þai suld se som gastly thing; Bot neuer þe less yhit saw þai nane Ne noght herd bot a voyce all ane. þe pryor bad þam all stand styll, And þus he spak þe voyce vntyll: ‘Whether ertow ane ill gast or a gud?’ þe voyce answerd with eger mode And said: ‘Sir, I am a gud gast: þat may I proue þe here in haste. For haly wrytt þus beres witnes: When god had made both more and les, He loked his werkes in ilk a wane, And þai war wonder gud ilk ane: All war gud, þat he gan ma; And, sen þat I am ane of þa, A gud gast I am forþi. And, als I am þe gast of Gy, þarfor may þou haue in mynde, þat I am a gud gast be kynde. Bot I am euyl for mine euil dede, And þarfor haue I payn to mede’. þe pryor answerd him in hy: ‘þou says noght ryght; and here now, whi: þat sall I schew þe here in haste. þou sais, þou ert a wicked gaste For þe payn, þat þou has here. I answere þe on þis manere: All payn es gud (þat proue I þe), þat ordaind es in gud degre, þat es to say, þat punysch syn Of þam, þat in erth wald noght blyn; For it es gyfen thurgh godes will. þarfor I say, it es noght ill, Ne þou es noght wicked þareby’. And þan answerd þe gast of Gy: ‘Ilk payne es gud, I graunt wele, For fra god es gyfen ilk a dele Bi iugement and bi reson clere For euell dedes, men has done here. Bot neuer þe less yhit es it ill To þam, þat it es gyfen vntyll. Mi payne es yuell to me all ane, For me it ponysch and other nane; And, sen I haue swilk euell payne For my syns, als es sertayne, Ane euell spirytt men may call me Vntill tyme, þat I clensed be Of euell dedes, þat I haue done’. And all þus said þe pryor sone: ‘Tell me apertely, or þou passe, Whilk mans spirytt þat þou wasse’. þan answerd þe voyce in hy And said: ‘I am þe spirit of Gy, þat here was husband in þis stede And, als yhe wait, newly dede’. þe pryor sayd: ‘þan wele I fynd Be reson, þat þou ert vnkynd, þat þou makes slyke sklaunder and stryf Both to þi self and to þi wyf; For, whils þat Gy was lyfand man, Ryghtwis was he halden þan And trew in fayth, of noble fame, And his wif allso þe same; And for þir meruails, þat þou mase, Now will men say in ilk a place, þat Gy was euell in all his lyfe, And þarfor turmentes he his wyfe, (For lawed folk in ilk a land Says, euell men er oft walkand— And Gy was halden gud allway): þarfor þou ert vnkynd, I say’. þe voyce answerd þan, als him thoght, And said: ‘Vnkynd ne am I noght Nouther to my wyf ne to my bodi; Enchesun sall I say þe, why, Be sawes, þat þou sall noght forsake; For swilk a skyll here I þe make. If þou haue gyfen a man to were Cote or hode or other gere And he, þat so þi cote has tane, Wald suffer for þi luf all ane In gud and euell to lyf and dy, War he noght kynd to þe forþi?’ þe pryor said: ‘Yhis, for sertaine’. And þan answerd þe voyce ogayne And said: ‘Sir, trewly I þe tell, In Gyes body whils I gan dwell, Of him I toke none other thing Bot his cors to my clethyng. þis cors, þat I dedely call, Gert vs bath in folyes fall; And for þe wickednes, þat it wroght, Am I in all þir bales broght; And his doyng was it ilk a dele, Als haly wrytt witnes full wele And says, þat lykyng here of fles Contrary to þe saule es. And, if I suffer noght þis payne, Gyes bodi and als his saule, sertayne, Suld suffer payne withouten ende In fyre of hell with many a fende; For ilk a man both more and myn Sall suffer penaunce for þair syn In þis erth here, whare þai dwell, Or els in purgatori or in hell; And Gyes body has now na skathe, And I am pyned to saue vs bathe. And efter, when we com to blys, What ioy sa I haue, sall be his; For both togyder sall be þan Body and saule of ilk a man. And, sen I suffer þir payns grym, I am noght vnkynd to him. And, sir pryor, allso þou says, þat I of Gy suld sklaunder rays: þarto I answer on þis wyse, þat I ger no sklaunder ryse. For þat es sklaunder kyndely kend, þat sownes in euell or hase euell end. Wha som it dose, mon dere aby; For haly wryt says openly: ‘Wa vnto þat man sall be, Thurgh whame sklaunder comes, sais he’. And, all if I answer for Gy, I do him no velany: Mi spekyng es all for his spede, þat I may neuen to yhow his nede; And als my speche may gretly gayn Till other saules, þat suffers payn. þat may þou, syr, þi seluen se: For all folk of þis cete Comes to þis hows full hastily, And specially þai pray for Gy, þat god delyuer him out of his care, Als þou and þi brether dyd are; And in þair prayers, þat þai ma, For other saules þai pray allswa, And prayers, þat men prayes for ane, May help vnto þe oþer ilk ane; And allso þa, þat er onlyue, Sall soner of þair syns þam schryue And gyf þam vnto penance hard, þat þai be noght pyned afterward. Forþi I sklaunder noght, say I, Gyes wyf ne his body; Bot all þe sauwes, þat I say now, Es for þair honour and þair prow’. þe pryor said: ‘þan ask I þe, How any man may euell be, When he es ded, sen þat he was Schryuen clene, or he gan pas, And was in will gud werkes to wirk And ended in trowth of haly kyrk And toke his sacramentes ilk ane’. þe voyce answerd sone onane And said, þat men may euell be On twa maners, ‘þat proue I þe, When þai er dede and schryuen clene; þat es on þis wise to mene: þai er euell, whare so þai wende, þat dampned er withouten ende, And þai er euell for certayne space, þat suffers payne in any place For þair syns, þat es to say, Till tyme þat þai be wasted oway. In my self þis same es sene: For I was schryuen in erth full clene, ?it am I euell, þis es certaine, Till I haue sufferd sertaine payne; For, als men may in bokes rede, Clerkes sais, þat it es nede, þat penance alls fer pas, Als lykyng here in þe syn was. þarfor I say, it suffyce noght To schryue a man in will and thoght, Bot if he may in dede fullfyll þe penaunce, þat es gyfen him tyll. For þat, at we do noght, or we dy, Sall be fullfyld in purgatory; And clerkes proues, þat a day here May þare reles vs of a yhere, And a day þare to suffer payne Es als a yhere here þare ogayne: þarfor es gud, þat men þam schryue And suffer penance in þair lyue’. þe pryor þan of him gan craue, If þat he wist oght, wha war saue, Or whilk men war dampned bidene, In þe stedes whare he had bene. þe voyce answerd þan him tyll And said: ‘It es noght godes will, þat I suld slyke þing descry.

For, if a man here lede his lyue In syn and sithen will noght him schryue Ne in hert will haue no care For þe dedes, he has done are, þan sall his aungell to him tell, How Crist suffyrd payns so fell, And how he dyed for his bihoue. And þat sall be to his reproue To schew him, how he was vnkynde Here on þis mold, whils he had mynde, And how þat he was mysauysede, Godes sacramentes when he dispysede, þat wald noght schryue him of his syn, Bot lyked it euer and ended þarein. And, when þir sawes er þusgate sayd, þan sall þe fendes obout him brayd And manase him with all þair myght And say: ‘Com forth, þou wreched wight!’ So sall þai harl him vnto hell Withouten end in dole to dwell.— And, if a man be clensed clene And schryfen of all his synnes bedene And take his sacramentes ilk ane And in þat tyme with ded be tane, Yf all his penaunce be noght done, His gud aungell sais to him sone: ‘Comforth þe wele, I sall þe were, þat þe deuels sall þe noght dere’; And to þe fendes þan sall he say: ‘Yhe wicked fendes, wende hethen oway, For yhe haue na part in þis man’. And þe fendes sall answer þan And say on þis wise: ‘Oures he es Be reson and be ryghtwisnes’, And þare þan sall þai schew ful sone All euell dedes, þat he has done Bath in eld and als in yhowth, Sen first he kyndely wittes couth, And say: ‘He synned þus and þus: þarfore him aw to wende with vs’. His gude aungell sall mak debate And say: ‘He synned, wele I wate, On þis wise, als yhe haue tald; Bot he es borowde, be yhe bald, For he was schryuen and clensed clene And toke his sacramentes all bidene, And sorow he made for his synnyng: To clensyng fyre þat sall him bryng; And þe meryte of Cristes passyon now Sall be betwix him and yhow And serue him for scheld and spere, þat yhour desaytes sall him noght dere; And Cristes hend and als his syde, þat thirled war with woundes wyde, Sall be bitwix him and yhour hende And fra yhour felnes him defende; And Cristes face, þat buffett was, Betwix him and yhour face sall pas, So þat he sall noght on yhow se Ne for na thing abaysed be; All Cristes body spred on þe rode Sall be vnto him armoure gude, Swa þat yhe sall haue no powere Him for to dere on na manere; All þe lymes of Ihesu fre, þat for mankynd war pyned on tre, Sall clens him now of his foly, He dyd with lyms of his body; þe saule of Crist, als yhe wele ken, þat yholden was for erthly men, Sall purge him now of all þe plyght, þat þis saule dyd thurgh his awen myght, So þat in him sall leue no gylt, Forwhi he suld with yhow be spylt, Ne no payn vnto him sall stand Bot purgatory, þat es passand: þare sall he suffer certaine space, Till he be purged in þat place, And sithen sall he with vs wende And won in welth withouten ende’. And þus es Cristes passyoune Sett bifor vs redy boune For to defend vs fra þe fende, Out of þis world when we sall wende: þarfor vs aw, if we be kynde, To haue þat passyoune mast in mynde.— And als men may haue helpyng gude Of Mary, þat es myld of mode: If we oght for hir here haue done, Baldli may we ask hir bone, And vs to help scho will hir haste, In ded when our myster es maste. For if a man, or he hethen fare, Be schryuen clene, als I said are, þat blyssed bryd will be full boune To socoure him in þat sesoune And fend fro þe fendes in fere And say to þam on þis manere: ‘Mayden and moder both am I Of Jesu, my son, god allmyghty, And of heuen am I coround quene And lady of all þe erth bidene, And I am emperys of hell, Whare yhe and other deuels dwell; And, sen þat I am quene of heuen Vnto my son þus sall I neuen, þat he sall deme for luf of me þis man in purgatory to be, Till he be clensed clene of syn, And so to heuen I sall him wyn. And also, sen I am lady Of all þe erth, þis ordaine I Thurgh þe will of my son dere, þat ilk a bede and ilk prayere, þat now in all þis warld es sayd, Vntyll his profett be puruayd, And all þe messes and almusdede Sall turne þis man now vnto mede; And bi þa dedes and be þa messe Sall his penaunce be made lesse, þat to him es ordaind for his syn, þat yhour falshede gert him fall in. And, sen I am emperis of hell, þarfor yhour force now sall I fell: I comand yhow, yhe hethen fare And at yhe noy þis man no mare, þat ended in my son seruyse’.— And, when scho has said on þis wyse. All þe halows hegh in heuen Hyes all vnto hir full euen And vnto Jesu all in fere, And þus þan mak þai þair prayere: ‘Lord Jesu, god allmyghty, Fader of heuen, man of mercy, Haue mercy on þis man, þat es Our awen brother and our fless! Sen þou wald com fra heuen on hight And suffer payn for mans plyght, þou meng þi mercy with þis man’.— þus sall man saule be saued þan, And his gud aungell sall him take To purgatory aseth to make, And to him he sall tak tent, Till he haue sufferd his turment. And þan þe wicked gastes sall ga þethen oway with mykell wa. On þis manere may gude prayere And almusdedes, þat men dose here, And meryte of Cristes passyoune And of halows gud orisoune Help a man in his dying And vnto clensyng fyre him bryng’. þe pryor said vnto him þan And asked, if þat any man Of Jesu Crist may here haue syght Or of Mary, his moder bryght, Or of þe halows verraily In þair right fourme, when þai sall dy’. þe voyce answerd and said: ‘Nay, Bot on þis wise, als I sall say, Bot if it be so haly a man, þat has na nede of purgyng þan Ne for to dwell in purgatory: þai may se þam openly, And synfull men may noght þam se’. þe pryor said: ‘þan think me, þat þou says now þi self to skorne Ogayns þe sawes, þou said beforne; For þou said, Cristes pascyoune And also Mary suld be boune And other halows, þat er in heuen, To pray for him with myld steuen: þan semes it, þat he se þam may’. þe voyce answerd and sayd: ‘Nay; þai sall be þare, I grant þe wele, Bot he sall se þam neuer a dele In þair lyknes verraily. And þis es þe encheson, whi: For þe grettest blys of heuen it es For to se Crist in his lyknes, þat es to say, in his godhede; þan thurt men haue nane other mede þan in þair dying him to se, And in þat blys þan þai suld be Sodainly at þair endyng: And þat war vnacordand thing’. þan þe pryor of him asked, If spirytes, þat es hethen passed, May kyndely knaw be morn or none þe dedes, þat here er for þam done, Or prayers, þat men for þam ma? þe voyce answerd and said: ‘Yha’. þe pryor said: ‘þan kan þou say, Wharof I sang mess to day’? þe voyce answerd ogayne full tyte And said: ‘þou sang of saint spiryte’. þe pryor answerd, als he knew, And said: ‘I se, þou ert noght trew: Of Requiem I sang, certaine, For cristen saules, þat er in payne; þarfor þou says noght sothfastly’. þe voyce answerd to him in hy: ‘I graunt graythely, or I gang, Of Requiem full ryght þou sang; Bot yhit I say þe neuer þe lesse, Of saint spirytt was þe messe. þat sall þou be ensaumple se: For, wele þou knawes, in ilk contre, If any man outher ald or yhing Of ane other suld ask a thing, What thing so lygges his hert most nere, þat in his speche sall fyrst appere And first be in his wordes allways; For god þus in his gospell says: ‘Ex habundancia cordis os loquitur: Of þe fulnes of þe hert Spekes þe mowth wordes smert’. And þe messe of saint spiryte To my profytt es mast perfyte And allso of þe trinite: þir messes moste amendes me; Bot þe mess of þe haly gast In my mynde es althir mast. And here now þe encheson, whi: For, whils I lyfed here bodily, I spended my wyttes and my powere Full of sythes in synnes sere, When I suld haue þam spended ryght To godes worschepe with all my myght And mensked þe fader with all my mayne. For of him comes all power playne, þat men has here, whils att þai lyf, After his grace als he will gyf. þarfor, what man so dose vnryght Thurgh his power or his myght Or be his strenkith, if þat it be, Ogayns þe fader þan synnes he; For al power he weldes allways, Als Dauid in þe psauter says: ‘Omnia, quecunque uoluit, dominus fecit’; He says: ‘þe fader may fullfyll In heuen, in erthe, what som he will’.— To Crist, god son, es gyfen full ryght All wysdom both bi day and nyght: þarfor god son þai syn ogayne, þat here dispendes þair wittes in vayne And settes þam so on werldly gude, þat ryches es mare in þair mode þan Crist, god son, þat boght þam dere. I haue synned on þe same manere.— Till þe haly gast es gyfen all grace And all bountes in ilk a place. Ogayns him oft siþes synned haue I, When þat I vsed in foule foly þe gyftes, þat he me gaf of kynde, And wald noght mensk him in my mynde; For my fauor and my fairhede Haue I done many synfull dede, And vertus haue I turned to vyce Thurgh wekid werkes als wryche vnwyse. Wharfore aseth now bus me make To the thre persons for my syn sake. þarfore messes of þe trinite May gretely help now vnto me For greuance, þat to me es graide, Als my gud aungell has me sayd; And, for þat I haue synned maste Ogayns þe gyftes of þe haly gast Couetand here mare ryches, þan he me gaf of his gudnes Or þan he vouched safe me to sende, þarfor, þis myss to amende, Messes sungen of saint spirytt In my payne may do mast respyt. And þarfor, sir pryor, I say, Of saint spiritt þou sang to day. All if þine office ordaind ware For cristen saules, als þou said are, þou toke with gud deuocioune Of þe haly gast ane orysoune, And þat ilk orysoune, for certayne, Alegged me mare of my payne þan all þe other, þat þou sayd (For tyll all saules þai war puruayd); And, sen þat helped me all ane Wele mare þan þe other ilk ane, Of þe haly gast, I say, þou sang: If þou me wyte, þou has þe wrang’. þe pryor askes him þan þis thing, For how many saules a prest myght syng In a tyme and in a stede, Whether it be for quyk or dede, And ilk ane haue in lyke gudenes And in lyke meryte of þe mess. þe voyce answerd and gan say, þat a prest anely on a day For all saules may syng and rede And ilk ane of his mess haue mede Bi vertu of þe sacrament. ‘And þarfor to þis tak tent: Jesus Crist with Jewes voyce Was anely offyrd on þe croyce, And þare he dyed and gaf þe gast Vnto his fader of myghtes mast For saluacioun of all mankyn And noght anely for a man syn. Ryght so þe prest in ilk a messe Offers Criste, ryght als he es In hale godhede, als clerkes ken, In amendement of all cristen men. þarfor in a messe may be tane All cristen sawles als wele als ane, And better may it part þam tyll: þat proue I þe be proper skyll. For gret difference may men fele Bitwene spirituall thing and temporele: Temporall thing, þat þou sese here, When it es parted in paracels sere, In þe ma parcels it parted es, It self leues ay wele þe les, þat es, for porcyoun partyse þar fra; Als if þou ane appell ta And part it in to many hende, With þi self sall lytell lende. On þe toþer side þou vnderstand, þat spirituall thing es ay waxand: þat may þou se be ryght resoune, Als if þou tak þis orysoune, þe Pater noster, and forth it ken Kyndely to all cristen men; And, so when þat it teched es, In it self it es noght les, Bot in vnderstandyng es it mare, When ma it kan, þan couth it are. So es þe messe and þe prayere, þat ordand er for saules sere, For ded and quyk, if þat it be: þe more it es in it degre’. þe pryor answers sone and says: ‘Haly wryt witnes allways, þat saules er saued, for certayne, And oft delyuerd of þair payne Thurgh speciall prayers and speciall dede, þat frendes dose here for þair mede; And þa frendes dose mare for ane þan for other saules ilk ane; þan think me, þat his mede sall fall Mare, þan it war done for all, And mare alegge him of his payne’. þe voyce answerd þus ogayne: ‘Ilk a prest, þat messe synges, Him nedes for to do twa thinges: First his prayers sall he make Specially for his frendes sake, Whilk he es mast halden vntyll, þat god him help of alkyns ill; And, when he has so prayed for ane, þan sall he pray for other ilk ane, And ilk ane has mede of þat messe; Bot he, for wham it ordaind es, Es helped mast fro bale þarby. And on þis same manere am I Delyuerd of my penaunce here, þat I suld haue sufferd, bi foure yhere, For mysdedes als it was dett: A lyfand frend þus has it lett. I haue a cosyn, þat þou wele knew, A pore frere, þat I fynd trew; I helped him, when he had nede, Whils he to þe scoles yhede; And allso sithen, when he was frere, I fand him fully fyue yhere. And for my self full wele I wroght: þat gudenes now forgetes he noght, For in his mynde he has me maste; þarfor I sall be helped in haste: I sall haue penaunce in þis place No ferrer bot fra hethen to Passe. If þou will witt þis for certayne, At Pasch com to þis place ogayne, And, if þou here noght þan of me, Sothly, certayne may þou be, þat I am hent vp in to heuen’. And, als he bad, he dyd full euen: At þe Pasch after þe hows he soght, And of þe voyce he herd ryght noght; þarfor he trowed, als he said are. Bot in þat tyme he asked mare And said: ‘Kan þou trewly tell, If þou in þat ilk heuen sall dwell, þat for godes halows es puruayd?’ þe voyce answerd sone and sayd: Sir, I tald þe are full euen, þat I come neuer yhit in heuen; þarfor I may tell þe no mare Of orders, þat er ordaind þare. Bot of blys may I be full bald, For þus myne aungell to me tald, To Pasch I suld in penance be, And þan, he said, þat I suld se þe kyng of heuen in his godhede With his aungels all on brede And with his halowes euerilk ane. And I answerd sone onane And sayd: ‘A, lord, me think full lang, þat meney till I com omang; Bot he be loued in ilk a place, þat vnto me has gyfen slyke grace!” þan said þe pryor: ‘What helpes mast Vnto heuen a saule to hast Out of þe payne of purgatory?’ þe voyce answerd and said in hy: ‘Messes may mast help þam þen, þat er said of haly men And namely of myld Mary fre’. þe pryor said: ‘þan think me, þe office of þe ded, certaine, Of Requiem, was made in vayne, Sen other auailes þam more þan it’. þe voyce answerd vnto him yhit And said: ‘Full mykell auail it may, When any men for all will pray; And, for þat lawed men here in land Kan noght graythely vnderstand, þat saules has nede of other messe, þarfor þat offyce ordaind es’. þe pryor said: ‘Sen þou has kende, þat specyall messes may mast amende, Whilk other prayers withouten þa May tyttest saules fra penaunce ta?’ þe voyce answerd and said in hy: ‘þe seuen psalmes with þe letany’. þe pryor said: ‘þat war noght ryght; For god þe Pater noster dyght, Als of all prayers pryncipall, And aungels made þe Aue all Vnto myld Mary for our mede, And þe twelue apostels made þe Crede. And þe VII psalmes er erthly werkes Ordand of byshopes and other clerkes Men for to say, þat has mysgane, And Dauid made þam euerilk ane; And nouther Dauid, wele we ken, Ne byshopes ne nane other men Vnto god er noght at neuen, Ne yhit vnto aungels of heuen Ne tyll apostels er þai noght pere: þarfore me think, þat þair prayere May noght of slyke bounte be Als þe Pater noster and þe Aue And þe Crede, þat þe apostels puruayde’. þe voyce answerd þan and sayde: ‘þir prayers er full mykell of mede And full haly, if we tak hede, In þam self. þis es sertayne, And for þair makers mykell of mayne: We sall þam wirschepe, als worthi es, Bifor all þe other, out tane þe messe.

And þan þe woman was full fayne And sayd þare kneland on hir kne A Pater noster and ane Aue; Scho loued god with word and will. And þan þe pryor said hir tyll: ‘Dame, whils þou þis lyf may lede, Ilk day, luke, þou do almusdede, For almusdede may syns waste’. Vnto þat word answerd þe gaste: ‘Dame’, he said, ‘par charyte, When þou dose almus, think on me, For to alegge som of my payne’. And þan þe pryor gan him frayne, Whi he come noght in þat sesoune Vnto men of religioune For to tell to þam his lyfe Titter þan vnto his wyfe, Sen þat he wist, þai war mare nere At pray to god, þan wemen were, And mare wisely þai couth him wys. þe voyce answerd þan vnto þis And sayd: ‘I lufed mare my wyfe þan any other man on lyfe, And þarfor first to hir I went; And, when me was gyfen þe iugement To suffyr penance in þis place, I asked god of his gret grace, þat my wife myght warned be For to amend hir mys bi me; And of his grace he gaf me leue On þis wise hir for to greue And for to turment hir biforne, So þat scho suld noght be lorne, Ne þat scho suld noght suffyr pyne For hir syns, als I do for myne, Bot do it here in hir lyf days’. All sone þan þe pryor says: ‘Can þou oght tell me, how lang þat þou sall thole þa payns strang?’ þe spirit sayd: ‘I vnderstand, To Pasch, þat now es next comand; þan sall my payne be broght till ende, And vnto welth þan sall I wende’. þe pryor said: ‘I meruail me, How þou to speke has swilk pouste And has na tong ne other thing, þat instrument es of spekyng’. þe voyce answerd on þis manere: ‘Ne sese þou noght, a carpentere, þat diuerse werkes oft syþes has wroght, Withouten ax may he do noght? And ay þe ax will redy be With him to hew on ilk a tre, And it may nouther styr ne stand Withouten help of mans hand. Ryght swa a man here yhow omell Withouten tong may na thing tell; And with his tong yhit spekes he noght Bot thurgh þe ordenance of þe thoght, þat es, of þe saule allways, þat ordans all, þat þe tong says.

And, whare þou says, a man may noght Speke þe thing, þat comes of thoght, Bot he haue mowth and tong als, In þat, I say, þi sawes er fals; For haly wryt witnes full ryght, þat god and all his aungels bryght Spekes wisely to ald and yhong, And þai ne haue nouther mowth ne tong. Ryght so may I and ilk spiryte Fourme voyces full perfyte And wirk þe wordes, how so we will, And spek withouten tong yhow tyll’. þe pryor askes him, in what stede þe saules dwelles, when men er dede, Vnto tyme þat þe dome be done; ‘For þan, þou says, þai sall witt sone, Whether þai sall to ioy or payne’. þe gast þan answerd sone ogayne And said: ‘A lytell while beforne, Or þat þe erthly lyf be lorne, þe saule sall se and here vnhyd All þe dedes, þat euer he dyd, þe vgly deuels and aungels bryght. And efter þe porcyon of his plyght In þat same tyme sall he se, Whider þat he sall iugged be— To comon purgatory, þat es stabyll, Or vnto purgatory departabyll Or els vnto þe payns of hell Or vnto heuen in blys to dwell’. þe prior þan with wordes hende Asked, how sone a saule may wende, When it es past fra þe body, To heuen or hell or purgatory. þe voyce answerd and sayd: ‘It may In a lytell space wend all þat way; Sone es it broght, whare it sall be, Als þou may be ensaumple se. þou sese, when þe son es rysand, þe lyght gase sone ouer ilk a land; It passes ouer all þe world full playne, Bot if þare stand oght þareogayne; Right swa þe saules, when men er ded, Al sone er in þair certaine stede: To heuen or hell þai wend in hy. And, if þai pass to purgatory, Som tyme wende þai noght so sone, And þat es for þair profett done: If þai haue any faythfull frende In þis world here, when þai wende, þat for þam will ger syng or rede Or els do any almusdede, þai may so do for þam þat tyde, þat in þe ayre þe saule sall byde, Vntyll it haue þe merit tane Of þair prayers euerilk ane; And so bi help of þair gudenes May his penaunce be made les; þe dedes, þat er so done in haste, Vnto þe saule es helpyng maste. On þe same manere, als I say, In þis cete was done þis day. A frere dyed and demed he was Till comon purgatory at pas; Bot in þe tyme of his transyng Of his breþer he asked þis thing, þat þai suld do in dede and saw For him, als þai war bon bi law; And þe messes, þat þam aght for to say, Pur charyte he gan þam pray, þat þai suld be said in hy And euerilk ane of our lady. And, als he bad, ryght so þai dyd, And afterward þan þus bityd: When he was dede in flessch and fell, His aungell demed his saule to dwell In comon purgatory playne Thre monethes to suffer payne, Als worthy was efter his dede; Bot þan our lady Mary yhede, And tyll hir son scho prayd þat tyde, þat þe saule in þe ayre suld byde, Vntyll it had þe meryte clere Of dedes, þat war done for it here; And twa oyres þan bayde it styll In þe ayre, als was godes wyll, And swilk mercy of god had he Thurgh prayer of his moder fre And thurgh þe dedes, þat here was done, þat he sall be in blys full sone; In payne he has no lengar tyme Bot fra now till to morne at pryme’. þan sayd þe prior till him sone: ‘Whilk dedes of all, þat here er done, May tyttest help a saule to heuen?’ þe voyce answerd and said full euen: ‘Parfyte werkes of charyte, þat er done, als þam aw to be, þat es to say, to godes bihoue, And our euencristen if we loue: þan of our werkes will god be payd’. þe pryor answerd sone and sayd: ‘If þat þou kan, tell vs in haste, What maner of men þat now er maste In purgatory to suffyr payne’. þe gaste answerd sone ogayne: ‘Na man comes þat place within Bot anely þai, þat has done syn; And all, þat syns and saued sall be, Er pyned þare of ilk degre Efter þe dedes, þat þai haue done’. And þan þe pryor asked sone, What manere of folk þat he here fande, þat in þair lyues war best lyfande. þe voyce said: ‘Sir, soth it es (And haly wryt wele beres wytnes), þat na man aw other to prays, Whether he do wele or euell always; For mans lyfe es to prayse na thing, Bot if he may haue gud endyng; For na man in þis world here wate, Whether he be worthi to luf or hate, Ne whether his werkes war euell or wele, Vnto þe dome be done ilk dele: þan sall he se him self, certayne, Whether he be worthi ioy or payne’. þe pryor said: ‘þis ask I þe: Whilk es þe maste parfyte degre Of all, þat in þis ground es grayde?’ þe gast answerd sone and sayde: ‘In ilk a state I se’, he says, ‘Som thinges to lak and som to prays; þarfor I will prayse na degre, Ne nane sall be dispraysed for me. Bot neuer þe less þis wald I rede, þat ilk a man in ilk a stede Serue god with all þair myght, In what degre so þai be dyght’. þe pryor asked with wordes stabyll, If þat god war oght mercyabyll To saules, þat er in purgatory. þe gast said: ‘Yha, sir, sykerly; For vnto som, þis es certayne, Relese he þe ferth part of þair payne, Of som þe thred part he releses, Of som þe secund part he seses. And þat es for gude prayers sake, þat frendes here for þam will make: If any dedes be for þam done, þan may þai pass fra payns sone. Lyfand frendes þus may þam lett Of payn, þat þai suld dregh be dett, And als þe prayers of aungels And of halows, þat in heuen dwelles’. þe pryor said: ‘þis wald I craue, Whatkyn payn þi self sall haue, In purgatory whils þou sall dwell’. þe voyce said: ‘I sall þe tell, In flawme of fyre þus bus me stand, þat alþer hattest es brynand, And haue na comforth me to kele’. þe pryor said: ‘Now se I wele, þat þou ert no sothfast gaste: þat sall I proue þe here in haste. þis wate þou wele, if þou haue mynde: God dose na thing ogaynes kynde; For, if he dyd, þis dar I say, His werkes wald sone be wast oway. And bodyly thing þe fyre I call, And þou es a gast spirytuall: And bodily thing may haue no myght In gastly thing bi day ne nyght; þan be ensaumple may þou se, þat fyre may haue no myght in þe, All if þou þarein graythely gang’. þe voyce said: ‘Sir, þou has þe wrang, þat þou me calles sa dyssayuabyll, Sen þou has fon in me no fabyll. Bot neuer þe lesse, sir, whare þou says, þat bodily thing be nakyn ways In gastely thing may haue powere, I answer þe on þis manere. þou wate wele, þat þe deuels sall lende In fyre of hell withouten ende, And þat fyre es als bodily Als þe fyre of purgatory, And yhit pynnes it þe deuels in hell, Als god witnes in his gosspell, How he to þe fendes sall say And to þe dampned on domesday: ‘Yhe weryed gastes, I byd yhow wende To þe fyre, þat lastes withouten ende, þat ordand es for na thing els Bot to þe deuell and his aungels’. And, whare þou says, þat god dose noght Ogaynes kynde in þinges, he wroght, I say, he dose, als folk may fynde, Bi miracle oft ogaynes kynde, Als whilom fell of childre thre, þat ordand war brynt to be. In haly wrytt er þai named so: Sydrac, Misaac and Abdenago. þai war done with full gret ire Intyll a chymne full of fyre; And, als it was our lordes will, þe fyre dyd nanekyn harme þam tyll; Bot hale and sounde þai satt and sang Louand þe myght of god omang: þus war þai saued in þat stede Fra fyre and fra þat kyndely dede. Ryght so has god ordand in me, þat þe fyre has no pouste To wast me, if I stand þarein, Bot for to pyne me for my syn’. þan sayd þe pryor: ‘Sen þou says, þat fyre obout þe bryns allways, þan think me, þat þis hows and we Suld bryn all for þe fyre of þe, Sen þat it es so hate and kene’. þe voyce sayd: ‘Now es wele sene, þat in þe es full lytell skyll. For ryght now tald I þe vntyll, þat god may withdraw thurgh his myght þe strenthe of fyre both day and nyght, So þat it no harme may do In thing, þat it es putt vnto, Als he dyd to þe childre thre, Of whame bifore I tald to þe. Allso þou sese, fyre of leuenyng Wendes obout be alkyn thing Kyndely, als clerkes declare it kan, And nouther bryns it hows ne man, Bot if it be thurgh ani chance, þat it brin bi goddes sufrance. And als þou sese, þe son may passe Thurgh wyndows, þat er made of glasse, And þe glass es noght enpayred þarby, So may a spiryt, sikerly, In ilk a place com in and out And bryn noght, þat es him obout, Howses ne clathes ne other atyre, All if him self be flaumd in fyre; And so þis hows may resayue me And it self noght enpayred be. Bot, certes, þis sall þou vnderstand: If all howses in ilk a land In a sted war brynand schire, It myght noght be so hate a fyre, Als I now suffyr nyght and day’. And þan þe pryor to him gan say Askand of him þis questiowne, If he trowed þe incarnacyoune, How Jesu Crist toke flessh and blode. þe voyce answerd with eger mode Till þat questyon all with envy, And full loud þus gan he cry: ‘A, my pryor, whilk er þa men, þat þe incarnacyoune will noght ken?

I wate noght, whi þam lyf es lent, Bot if it be to þis entent, þat cristen men may on þam fyght In þe fayth for to defend þair ryght; For, on þam bataile for to bede, May cristen men encres þair mede, If faith be fully in þair fare’. And þan þe pryor asked mare: ‘Kan þou oght tell me, whilk manere of syn Er vsed mast omang mankyn?’ þe voyce answerd on þis wise: ‘Pryde, lychory and couatyse And vsury, þir foure in fere With þair braunches many and sere, þai er full wlatsom day and nyght Bifor god and his aungels bryght. And thre syns er, if þai be done, For whilk god will tak vengance sone: Ane es, if man and woman here Won samen, als þai wedded were, And wandes noght þair will to wirk Withouten þe sacrament of haly kyrk, Or if þai be wedded þat tyde And outher syn on outher syde To breke þair spowsage in þat space: To god þis es a gret trispase. þe tother syn es noght to say, Bot clerkes full kyndely knaw it may. þe thred syn es full euell thing, þat es manslaghter with maynsweryng’. þus when all þir sawes war sayd, þe woman to þe prior prayd, þat he wald spek þe gast vntyll, So þat he dyd hir no more ill For goddes luf of myghtes mast. þe pryor þan said to þe gast: ‘I coniure þe be god all ane And bi his halows euerilk ane, If þou may schon, þat þou sese And lat þi wyf now lyf in pese And persue hir no more with payne’. þan þe gast answerd ogayne: ‘þat may I noght for nanekyns nede, Bot scho lyf chaste in wydowhede And allswa ger syng for vs twa Thre hundereth messes withouten ma: A hundreth of þe haly gast sall be Or els of þe haly trinite And a hundreth of our lady And of Requiem fyfty And other fyfty als in fere Of Saint Peter, þe apostell dere’. þe woman herd þir wordes wele And graunted to do ilk a dele; Sone, als sho might, sho mad hir boun Till all þe freres of þat toune And prestes and monkes of ilk abbay And gert þam syng all on a day Thre hundreth messes gudely grayde On þe couand bifore sayde; And, so when þat þai songen ware, þe gast of Gy greued hir no mare. Bot yhit þe pryor in þat place Vnto þe gast twa resons mase And asked, if he wist, on what wyse Or in whilk tyme Anticrist suld ryse And tak ogayn trew cristen men. þe gast on þis wise answerd þen And said: ‘It falles noght vnto me To tell noght of godes preuete; It es na question vs vnto, What so his will es for to do’. þe prior said: ‘Me think ryght wele, þou heres oure spekyng ilk a dele’. þe gast said: ‘Yha, for certayne’. And sone þe pryor sayd ogayne: ‘þan has þou eres to þi hereyng, Forwhi þou ert a bodily thing And noght gastly, als þou has tald’. þe voyce answerd with wordes bald: ‘Haly wryt þus telles vs till: ‘þe spirit enspires, whare it will, And his voyce wele may þou here; Bot þou may noght on na manere Witt, what place þat it comes fra Ne vnto what place it sall ga”. And, ryght als he þir wordes gan say, Sodainly he went oway, So þat þai herd of him no mare In þat tyme, whils þai war þare. And be þan was tyme of euensange, And þe prior bad ilk man gang In þe name of god, whare þai wald be; ‘And, whare yhe com, in ilk contre, If yhe be asked of þis case, Says þe soth, ryght als it wase And als it es here proued in dede’. And hastily þan hame þai yhede. þe pryor þan withouten faile þe woman þus he gan counsaile, þat scho suld kepe hir clene and chaste, Als scho was warned with þe gaste; And als he bad ane other thinge, þat ilk day a prest suld synge Contynuely þare in þat place For Gy saule fro þethen to Pase. With full gud will þe woman dyd, Als þe pryor gan hir byd: A prest scho gat with full gud chere. Bot hir hows durst scho noght com nere: Scho was so dredand ay for dole. And on þe twelft day efter Yhole, þat clerkes calles Epiphany, Vntyll þe freres scho went in hy, And tyll þe prior sone scho yhode, þat had done hir so mykell gude. And he ordaind with all his mayne Vntyll hir hows to wend ogayne For to here and herken mare, If þai myght fynd þat ferly fare. He toke of other orders twa, Of Austyns and Menours allswa, So þat þai war twenty freres All samen withowten seculeres. And samen so ogayne þai went To Gyes hows with gud entent, And in þat hows said þai and he ‘Placebo’ with þe ‘Diryge’ For his saule, þat was husband þare, Als he and his brether did are. When all was sayd in gud degre Till ‘Requiescant in pace’, þai herd a voyce com þam besyde, Als it did at þat other tyde; Lyke a besom bi þam it went, þat war swepand on a pauement. þarfor som of þe folk war flayd; Bot till it sone þe pryor sayd: ‘I coniure þe with mayn and mode In þe vertu of Cristes blode, In þis stede at þou stand styll And answer, what we say þe tyll’. And þan þe voyce with wordes meke Als a man, þat had bene seke, Vntyll þe pryor þus gan say: ‘Whi deres þou me þus ilk a day? It es noght lang, sen I tald þe All, þat þou wald ask of me. What suld I now say to yhow here?’ And þan answerd ane other frere, A diuynour of gret clergy, And said: ‘Tell here till vs in hy, Whether þat þou of payn be quytt, Or els what payne þou suffers yhit’. þe voyce answerd sone onane And sayd: ‘Loue god all his lane! For swilk grace vnto me es grayde Thurgh messes, þat war for me sayde, þat fra þis tyme now afterward Am I past fra þe payns hard In comon purgatory, þare I was are: In þat place sall I com no mare’. Vntyll þat voyce þan said þe frere: ‘Tell vs, what pain has þou here, Sen þou fra purgatory es paste’. þe voyce answerd at þe laste: ‘I suffer flawme of fyre full hate’. þe frere said: ‘Tell vs, if þou wate, If any thing amend þe may’. þe voyce answerd and sayd: ‘Nay; Me bus it suffer certaine days’. Yhit þan þe prior to him says: ‘Lo, how haue I gederd here Freres and other folk in fere Of þi wordes to bere witnes And of þir meruayls mare and les, þat we may all þis case declare Bifor þe pape, when we com þare; And þarfor tell vs som meruaile, þat we may trow withouten fayle’. þe voyce answerd to þir sawes: ‘I am noght god (þat wele þou knawes), And meruayls falles to na man els Bot vnto him and his aungels. And neuer þe less þus I yhow teche: Bot if yhe better þe pople preche, þan yhe haue done þis tyme beforne, Lightly may yhe be forlorne; And speke yhe sall mast specyally Ogayns þe syn of symony, Vsur, manslaghter and maynsweryng, Avoutry and fals witnes beryng. þir syns bot if þe folk forsake, I warn yhow, god will vengeance take, And warn it, whar for þe prayere Of myld Mary, his moder dere, And of his halows euerilk ane Greuouse vengance mond be tane Full many tymes omang mankyn, When þai vse swilk outrage syn. And yhe sall suffer þe same payne, Bot if yhe preche fast þareogayne. For syn es vsed now wele mare þan any werkes of godes lare: þat sall þai som tyme full sare rew’. þan asked þe pryor, if he knew, How many papes suld be of Rome Fra þat tyme tyll þe day of dome. þe voyce said: ‘I kan tell na thing, What sall fall in tyme comyng; þarfor þou may noght wit for me, How many papes of Rome sall be Ne what sall com ne what es gane. And þarfor may yhe now ilk ane, Whare so yhe will, wende forth yhour way; Bot prayes for me more, if yhe may, And for all saules, þat suffers payne. For þis I say yhow for certayne: Haly kyrk prays noght so fast For cristen saules, þat hethen er past, Als þai war won, ryght wele I ken, Ne no mare dose religiouse men. þarfor I rede, þai mend þam sone, Or any euell be to þam done’. þir tales when he had tald þam tyll, He sayd no mare, bot held him styll, And of him herd þai þan no mare. þarfor all men, þat þare ware, Went and tald þir thinges ilk one Playnly vnto þe pape John þe twa and twenty, I vnderstand. And at þe Pasch next folowand þat same pape sent men of his For to seke þe soth of þis (þe hows of Gy oft sythes þai soght), Bot of þe gast ne fand he noght, And þareby myght men witt full euen, þat he was went vp intyll heuen, Whare comforth es withouten care, Als him self had said þam are. Vntyll þat comforth Crist vs ken Thurgh prayer of his moder! Amen.</field>
