À LA MÉMOIRE DE MON BIEN CHER ET BIEN AMÈREMENT REGRETTÉ STÉPHANE MALLARMÉ, ESPRIT EXQUIS ET COEUR D'OR, JE DÉDIE L'ÉDITION DÉFINITIVE DE CES FLEURS DE TRISTESSE QU'IL AIMAIT QUAND-MÊME. SINE ME, LIBER..... The dawn of a new age is in the sky; The crimson presage of the coming sun Reddens the dark horizon's rim of dun And life lifts up expectant hands on high: A new world born is, a new era nigh. Sun-weary, having watched the old world die; What reck I if the new world smile or sigh, Who know both idle? What things shall be done, What wonders wrought in it, what victories won, What old quests ended and what new begun, Me irketh not; I shall not see them, I: Thank heaven, they are not for my ear and eye. This world which is to be is none of mine: Its Gods are not my Gods, not mine its aim. That which it counteth honour, I hold shame; It setteth nought by what I deem divine. Its hopes and fears and mine are not the same; Not mine its praises are, not mine its blame; Its griefs are strange to me; its joys I shun, Fear not its curse nor crave its benison. For me, its cup is brimmed with poisoned wine, Its light of life is as a marish flame, That wiles through moor and fen the wandering one. In such a world I were a soul in pine, A disinherited, discarded son, An unlaid ghost among a alien line. So is it well for me that Fate the sign Of life fulfilled hath set against my name, Marking the meted goal, the ended game: My tale of labour told, my race nigh run, I wait my wage, the rest denied to none. Yet, standing with one foot upon Death's stair, I turn, these pallid blossoms in my hands, The idle spoil of thrice-enchanted lands, Dim garlands gleamed in many a dream-world way, And cast them forth upon the morning air, For gift and greeting to the coming day, Willing them fare without me where they may. NARRATIVE POEMS. THE ROMAUNT OF SIR FLORIS. Sir Floris. This is all that is extant of the Romaunt of Sir Floris. The Second Canto, comprising an elaborate romance of love and adventure, was lost shortly after completion and has never been recovered or rewritten. The third Canto, completing the work, was never written. ”A un chevalier de Provence vint ennuit un appel miraculeux et luy fut IN NOMINE CHRISTI par trois fois mandé soy lever et ensuyvre une colombe blanche: ce que fesant fut mené danz un jardin mirificque ou avecques grant poine occist sept bestes mescrées que auters ne furent que li sept pechiés mortels. Adonc fut merveil-lousement emporté par dessus les mers au Mont Salvat ou gist receleiment le sacrosainct Greal. La fut accolé chevalier du Greal et voire luy apparust nostre Seignour et luy baisa de sa propre bouche. Sur ce perdist connoissance et lors de son resveil soy trouva chiez luy. Cy-après erra maints ans par le monde ouvrant loiaument ès choses de son servage: aussi dict on que ce durant fut par deux fois de plus visité de ladiste colombe et puis fut en toute vie ravi fors de ce monde. Cert est toutes fois que ne rapparust mais aux yeulx humains.”—Le Violier des Histoires Provenciaux. In this sweet world and fair to see, There is full many a mystery, That toil and misery have wrought To banish from the sight and thought Of striving men in this our air Of pain and doubt, and many a fair Sweet wonder that doth live and move Within the channel of Christ's love. And of these, truly, aforetime Was made full many a tender rhyme And lay of wonder and delight; And by full many a noble knight And minstrel was the story told, With the sweet simple faith of old, Of how the questing was fulfill'd Of that Sangreal that was will'd By the dear God to Galahad, And how by many a one was had Rare venture in the holy Quest, Albeit very few were blest With comfort in the sight of it; And by that menestrel, to wit, (Oh sweetest of all bards to me And worthiest to Master be Of all that sing of Christ His knight And Questing of the Grail!) that hight Of Eschenbach, the tale was writ Of Percivale, that now doth sit Within the bosom of the Lord, And how he strove with spear and sword Full many a year for Christ His grace. And with delight of those old lays, There long has murmur'd in my brain A song that often and again Has cried to me for utterance; And now—before the sad years chance To bear all thought of holiness From men with mirk of pain and stress Of toil—it wearies me to tell Of all that unto Floris fell, And all his toil and all his bliss And grace in winning to Christ's kiss. Wherefore, I pray you, hearkeneth, The while with scant and feeble breath I tell to you a quaint old tale, Wherein is neither sin nor bale, But some sweet peace and sanctity: And there not only wonders be, But therewithal a breath of love Is woven round it and above, That lovers in the Summer-prime May clasp warm hands o'er this my rhyme, As finding there some golden sense Of Love's delicious recompense: For what withouten love is life? And if therein is any strife, Or therewithal offences be, I pray you pardon it to me: Wherefore, Christ hearten you, I say, Et Dieu vous doint felicité. I.THE FIRST COMING OF THE DOVE. HARD by the confluence of Rhone A castle of old times alone Upon a high grey hill did stand And look'd across the pleasant land; And of the castle castellain And lord of all the wide domain Of golden field and purple wood And vineyards, where the vine-rows stood In many a trellis, Floris was; A good knight and a valorous And in all courtesies approved, That unto valiantise behoved. Full young he was and fair of face And among ladies had much grace, And favour of all men likewise: For on such stout and valiant guise His years of manhood had he spent In knightly quest and tournament, There was no knight in all the land Whose name in more renown did stand, And the foe quaked to look upon The white plume of his morion, When through the grinding shock of spears Sir Floris' war-cry pierced their ears And over all the din was blown The silver of his clarion. So was much ease prepared for him And safety from the need and grim Hard battle against gibe and sneer That must full oft be foughten here— For evil fortune and the lack Of strength to thrust the envious back— By many a noble soul and true; And had he chosen to ensue The well-worn path that many tread For worship, all his life were spread Before him, level with delight. But if in shock of arms and fight Of squadrons he disdainèd not To win renown, the silken lot Of those that pass their days in ease And dalliance on the flower'd leas Of life was hateful to his soul; And so—when once the battle's roll And thunder was from off the lands Turn'd back and from the war-worn hands The weapons fell—he could not bring His heart to brook the wearying Of peace and indolent disport Of ease. Wherefore he left the court— So secretly that no one knew Awhile his absence-and withdrew A season to his own demesne, And there in solitude was fain To yearn for some fair chance to hap And win his living from the lap Of drowsy idlesse with some quest, That should from that unlovely rest Redeem him to the old delight Of plucking—in the bold despite Of danger—from the brows of Fate Some laurel. Nor had he to wait The cooling of his knightly fire; There was vouchsafed to his desire, Ere long, a very parlous quest, That should unto the utterest Assay his knightly worth and test The temper of his soul full well And sore. And on this wise it fell. It chanced one night,—most nigh the time When throgh the mist-wreaths and the rime The hours begin to draw toward The enchanted birthnight of the Lord,— That in the midnight, on his bed, He heard in dreams a voice that said “Arise, Sir Floris, get thee forth, An thou wouldst prove thee knight of worth!” Gross slumbers of the middle night So held and clipp'd the valiant knight, He might him not to speak address For slumber and for heaviness. Again it rang out loud and clear, So that he might not choose but hear, And in his heart he quaked for fear; But still he lay and answer'd not, Such hold had sleep upon him got. A third time through the chamber past The voice, as 'twere a trumpet's blast: “Arise, Sir Floris, harness thee, For love of Christ that died on tree!” He started up from sleep for fear And groped to find a sword or spear, Thinking some enemy was near; But of no creature was he ware. He saw the moon hang in the air— As 'twere a cup of lucent pearl— And in the distance heard the swirl Of waters through the silence run; But other sight or sound was none. The moonbeams lay across the night, In one great stream of silver-white, And folded round the Christ that stood At bedhead, carven in black wood; And Floris, looking on the way Of light that through the chamber lay, Was ware of a strange blossoming— As of some birth of holy thing— That in the bar of silver stirr'd; And as he gazed, a snow-white bird Grew slowly into perfect shape, As if some virtue did escape From that strange silver prisonhouse Into the city perilous Of life, and for its safety's sake, The likeness of a fowl did take. The light seem'd loth to let it go Into this world of sin and woe (So pure and holy) and put out Long arms of white the dove about, As if to net it safely in: But, as the holy bird did win Its way and through the meshes rent, The rays of light together blent And fell into a cross of white, Whereon the silver dove did light Above the image benedight. Sir Floris wonder'd at the sight, And looking on the cross, himseem'd That from the Christ a glory gleam'd And lay in gold toward the door; And something bade him go before. He rose and girt himself upon With helmet and with habergeon, And in his hand his sword full bright He bore, that Fleurdeluceaunt hight. The dove flew out into the air, And Floris follow'd through the bare Dumb ways and chambers to the gate, Whose open leaves for them did wait, And as into the night they past, Together were behind them cast. The night was dumb, the moon did glower Upon them, like a pale sick flower That in the early chill of spring Mocks at the summer's blossoming, And over every hill and stowe The ways were white and sad with snow. So pass'd he, with the silver dove That went before him and above, Within the sheeny moonés light— Wherewith her outspread plumes were dight, So that it seem'd each wing became And grew into a silver flame— Until the hollow'd snow was track'd Into a woodway, where there lack'd The moonlight and the mountain-side With drooping ash and linden vied To keep the hollow place from sight Or glimmer of the pearly light. The dove flew in, and following, Sir Floris heard a muffled ring Of silver in the mountain's womb, As if dead music there had tomb. Here she with folded wings did beat Upon the rock that stayed his feet; Whereat it open'd, and they went, By dint of some strange wonderment, Into a place of flowers, all sprent With jewels of the blossom-time; And all the air was sweet with rhyme: There reign'd an endless summer-prime. Tall green was there of leaféd trees, And in the blossom'd walks the breeze Was music, such as winds and plays About the May-sweet woodland ways, When spring is fresh and hope is clear; And in the place, where leaves are sere On earth, there lay great heaps of gold, Ywrought by wizardry untold To semblance of the Autumn's waste, Through which the sweet wind play'd and chased Its frolic breaths with perfume laden. In grass stood many a white maiden That lily in the outworld hight; And roses all the herbage dight. Bright plaited beds of jewel-flowers Were thick-set in the garden bowers, And many a row of sunflowers stood Along the marges of the wood, And to the sapphire heaven turn'd, As if toward the sun they burn'd. About the blossoms, round and over, Strange golden-crested birds did hover, That flash'd and sparkled like a flight Of wingèd starlets in the night; And as they went, their pinions beat The air of that serene retreat To rush and sweep of magic song, And through the trees was sweet and strong The trill of lark and nightingale. There was not any note of wail, In song of birds or sweep of wind, Such as in woodlands calls to mind The last year's winter and the next, Wherewith the listener's soul is vext And thinks how short the spring will be And how the flower-times change and flee Toward the dreary month of snows. The full glad passion of the rose Was joyous in the garden air, And every sight and sound was fair With unalloy'd contentedness. There could not enter any stress Of labour or of worldly woe; But ever through the place did flow A silver sound of singing winds, A breath of jasmine and woodbinds, As if all joy were gather'd there And prison'd in the golden air. And as Sir Floris wonderèd At those sweet flow'rets white and red And at the stream's sweet song, that set The garden-breezes all afret With breaking waves of melody, And at the bird's sweet minstrelsy,— There came to him a damozel (How fair she was no man can tell), And said, “Fair knight, now wit thou well That thou hast gotten great renown, In that sad world where trees are brown And ways are white in winter-time, And hast in many a maker's rhyme Been celebrate for gentilesse And valiant doings in the press Of armèd knights and battle-play, In tournament and in mellay; And over all the land is known How, many a time, thy horn has blown To succour maidens in distress, And oftentimes have had redress The needy by thy stroke of sword. So that to him, that is the lord Of this fair place, the fame has won Of all that thou hast dared and done In perfectness of chivalry; And he, who uses well to see Great deeds of arms and shock of spears, Has seen no one in all these years That may be chosen for thy peer; And therefore has he brought thee here, To try thee if thou canst endure Battle and venture, forte et dure Beyond the wont of men on earth; Wherein if thou canst prove thy worth, He will advance thee to his grace And set thee surely in high place Among his knights.” “Fair damozel,” Said Floris, “liketh me full well The quest, by what you say of it: But now, I pray you, let me wit Who is this lord, whose hest you bear, That is so high and debonair? And what adventure must I prove Before that I can win his love?” And she, “His name I may not tell; Hereafter shalt thou know it well; But thou shalt see him presently.” Then did she join her bended palms, And falling down upon her knee Among the knitted herbs and haulms, Did softly sing a full sweet rhyme; And in a little space of time Was visible among the treen— Against a trellised work of green That at the garden's farthest end Athwart the leaves did twine and wend— A man, that walk'd among the flowers As slftly as the evening hours Walk in the summer-haunted treen. Full tall and stately was his mien, And down his back the long hair lay, Red-gold as is the early day. Whereon a crown of light was set: Whoever saw might ne'er forget The sweetness of his majesty. But in no wise might Floris see Or win to look upon his face; For, as he went, he turn'd aside His visage, as it were to hide The light of its unearthly grace From mortal eyes. Then Floris said, “I pray thee of thy kindlihead, Fair maid, that I may come to look On this lord's visage.” But she shook Her head, and “Patience!” did she say. “Thou must in fear and much affray, For this fair place and for the fame Of him that master of the same And sovereign is, be purged and tried And many a venture must abide, Ere thou mayst look upon his face And win the guerdon of his grace. And now the time is come to prove Battle and hardship for his love. Adieu, sir knight: be bold and true!” Whereat she sped beyond his view, And eke that figure vanishèd; But Floris, lifting up his head, Was ware of a strange hand that bare A cross and stood in middle air And on the white plume of his crest Did for a moment lie and rest. Therewith great ease was given him, And healing freedom from all dim Sad doubt of fortune and of fate In that great strife, that did await His proving: and the strength of men In him was as the strength of ten Redoubled. Then he saw, beside His feet, a flower-bed fair and wide Of roses mingled red and white, Full sweet of smell and fair of sight, That in a trellised red-gold grate Did hold a high and holy state And spread around such wealth of balm, Their scent seem'd one great golden psalm Of perfume to the praise of God. Then Floris knelt upon the sod Of that fair place and unto prayer Betaking him, was quickly ware How up the silver-spangled grail— That through the green did twine and trail Of that bright garden's goodliness— Some gruesome thing tow'rd him did press, As 'twere the roses to despoil. So sprang he lightly from the soil And from its scabbard iron-blue His falchion Fleurdeluceaunt drew And kiss'd its fair hilt cruciform; Wherewith his heart wax'd bold and warm With courage past the wont of men. Now was a loathly thing, I ween, Made visible to him—that might Well take the boldest with affright. For up the sward to him did run A beast yet never saw the sun; As 'twere a dog with double head, Whose hinder parts were fashionèd Into the likeness of a worm. Full black and grisly was his form And blazing red his eyes and tongue With raging choler, such as stung His lusting heart to rob and tear The flowers that in the garden were. But as he came anigh the place Wherein those roses all did grace The greensward, to his troubled sight Was visible that valiant knight, That in whole armour of blue steel Before the flowery shrine did kneel, To save the emblems of Love's joy From his most foul and rude annoy. Wherefore at him with open mouth The monster ran, as 'twere its drouth And ravening lust to wreak and slake Upon him. Then did Floris take His sword, and with so stout a blow Upon the beast's twin neck did throw The edge, that with the dolorous stroke The thread of its foul life he broke In twain, and from the sunder'd veins The black blood strew'd with loathly stains The tender grass and herbs therein; And as among the flowers-stalks thin The hideous purple gore was sprent, From forth the stain (O wonderment And grace of Mary merciful!) There open'd out the petals full And lovesome of that snowy bloom That is in all earth's sin and gloom The fairest of all flowers to see, The lily of white chastity. Right glad was Floris of the sight And of the scent that from the white Gold-hearted bells to him was lent; And as he o'er the blossom bent To breathe its fragrance, suddenly There came a sound across the lea, That was as if a lion roar'd; And truly o'er the flowered sward There ran to him a tawny beast, Red-maned, that never stay'd nor ceased To roar, until the knight could feel His hot breath through the grated steel That barr'd his vizor, and his claws Sought grimly for some joint or pause In the hard mail, where he might set His tusks and through the rent veins let His life-blood out upon the land. But Floris, lifting up his brand, Him with such doughty strokes oppress'd Upon his red and haughty crest, That soon he made him loose his hold; And in a while, no longer bold And arrogant, he would have fled, But that Sir Floris on his head With the sharp edge smote such a blow, The red blood from the rift did flow, And with the blood the life did pass: Wherefore from out the bloodied grass There was uplift the rose of love, With scent and blossom fair enough, I trow, to guerdon many a toil And many a battle in the coil Of earthly woes. But there was yet No time for Floris to forget His trouble in the red flower's sight: He must again in deathly fight Be join'd for the security Of that fair garden's purity. For swiftly in the lion's place A raging leopard came, the grace Of those sweet roses to despoil; And as he came, the very soil Quaked underneath him, such a might To wreak his cholerick despite 'Gainst him that was the sovereign Of that fair place, and such disdain Did rage in him, that he could see No thing for anger. So was he Against the roses well nigh come, Nay, was in act to spoil their bloom, When through his heart the deadly blade Slid cold; and turning round, he made At Floris with a vengeful roar, And with his claws his thigh he tore A hand's-breadth in his agony. Then down upon the grass fell he And died; and in the tender sward, Whereon his felon blood was pour'd, The sign of humbleness was set, The flower that men call violet. Full faint was Floris with the loss Of blood, that from the wound across His thigh did run in many a rill, And would have fain awhile been still Without reproof. But no repose Must he expect (nor one of those That in God's battle fight on earth) Nor pleasance of delight and mirth, But many a dint and many a blow Unceasing, till God will his woe Be ended and the goal be won. And so, as there he sat, anon, Whilst wearily he look'd along The fair wide path, he saw the strong Slow travel of a hideous snake, That with much toil its way did make Toward the roses where he stood. So faint he was with failing blood He might not summon any strength To smite its black and gruesome length At vantage, crawling, but must wait Until, with slow and tortuous gait, It won to him. So weak he was, He could not choose but let it pass Toward the trellis; and eftsoon, By him that lay in some half swoon, Across the grass it slid and twined, About the grating that confined The flowers, its black and hideous length And breathed on them with all the strength Of hate its envying soul could know To gather in a breath, and so To spoil their fresh and goodly bloom: Whereat the blossoms with the gloom Of its black coils, that shut the light From over them, and with affright And sickness of its loathsome breath, Came very nigh to take their death. For with such potent spells the air Its venom darken'd of despair And malice, that the lovely red And white of their bright goodlihead Was to a sickly pallor turn'd, As if some loathly fever burn'd Within their hearts: and in a while No kiss of breeze or golden smile Of sun had won them back to life, So spent were they with the fell strife Of that curs'd beast,—had not a sweep Of wings awaken'd from the sleep Of pain Sir Floris and the scream Of a great bird, whose plumes did seem To brush his forehead, roused his sense From the constraint of indolence. Then sprang he up in strength renew'd; And when he saw the serpent lewd And hideous, that in his embrace Did strangle all the life and grace From out the flowers, he made at him And with a grip so fierce and grim Oppress'd his scaly swollen neck, That with the dolour and the check Of blood within his venom'd veins, The snake must needs relax the chains In which he held the rosery; And in the act so mightily He leapt at Floris, that he wound His arms and body closely round With scaly rings, and so uneath Did grip the knight, that little breath Seem'd in his body to be left; But, summoning all strength, he reft The horrid fetters from his breast And flung the worm with utterest His might full length against the ground. There whiles it lay in seeming swound; And Floris, thinking it was dead, Would have lain down his weary head Upon the grass, to take some ease Awhile. Then from among the trees There came that fowl, that had awoke Him with its passing pinions' stroke, And with so hard a buffet drove Him down to earth, he could nor move Nor speak awhile, but lay as dead: And that foul bird, with eyes of red And vulture claws, did strive the while At every joint and crack of mail To wound him with its noisome beak. At last a place it found where weak The armour was, and with such spite Into Sir Floris' flesh did bite, That for the fierceness of the pain He started up from sleep again And with so fierce and stout a blow The vulture strake, the steel did go Athwart the pinions and the crest, And riving down the armour'd breast, Did hew the gruesome snake in twain, In whom the life began again To flutter. So the loathly two With that stroke died; and with the dew Of their foul blood, the lovely green Of the fair sward did such a spleen And hate of its despiteous hue Conceive, that quickly sprang to view A twine of snow-white clematis, The sign of sweet content that is; And where the bird in death was cold, There grew the glad bright marigold, That in its gay and golden dress Was ever symbol of largesse, Since all along the meads there run Its mimic mirrors of the sun, Withouten any speck or flaw. But none of this Sir Floris saw, Nor how the roses lightly wore The freshness of their bloom once more; So weary was he and so worn With strife, and therewithal so torn With claws and beak of that fierce bird, He lay aswoon and saw nor heard Or sight or sound. Now must I tell A wondrous thing that here befell, Through grace of God and Christ His Son: For, while he lay aswoon, came one In white and shining robes array'd, And touch'd him on the lips and said, “Arise, Sir Floris, whole of wound, And fill thy quest!” And so was gone. And Floris started up from ground And was all whole in flesh and bone And full of heart the end to dare Of that hard venture. Then the air Was of a sudden darken'd o'er With some foul thing, that semblance wore Of a half bird and a half worm, Join'd in one foul and loathly form; And with the rattle of the scales Upon its wings—that (as huge flails Upon the golden garnered wheat With ceaseless rhythmic pulse do beat) Did lash and wound the golden air— The songs of breezes deaden'd were, And all was dumb for much dismay: And with its sight the lift grew gray. And as it wheel'd on open wings, With many blows and buffetings It strove to daunt that valiant knight And him enforce for sheer affright To yield to it and let it fill Its hungry maw at its foul will With those fair flowers. But Floris stood Undaunted, and with many a good Stout stroke of point did wound the beast, Wherewith it bled and much increased Its ravenous rage. Then, suddenly, He felt sharp claws about his knee, And looking down, no little wroth, He saw a huge and monstrous sloth, Which with such might did grip his thighs And clipt his arms on such hard wise, That he could scarce with bended shield Resist him and uneath could wield His trusty sword; and as he strove That monster from his grip to move, The dragon with so fell a swoop Against him from on high did stoop, That down upon the ground he fell, And in the falling did repel The sloth from off him. Then the twain With such foul rage at him again Did press and buffet, that the life Out of his breast with that fierce strife Was well nigh chased: but, by good hap, It chanced he fell into the lap Of those fair blooms of various kind That did his victory call to mind Against the cruel beaten foes; And falling heavily from blows Of beak and talons, he with such A grinding weight did press and crush The blossoms in the harsh and rude Encounter, they must needs exude From out their chalices the sweet And precious essences that meet To make the perfume of a flower, And on his face and hands did shower Their gracious balms. So sweet they were And of a potency so rare For salving every earthly pain, The life began in every vein With their pure touch to run and glow; And soon the weary weight and woe That lay on Floris was dispell'd. Then, with new strength, from him he fell'd That hideous sloth; and being free An instant from his tyranny And harsh oppression, to his feet He sprang once more and to defeat The wingèd worm himself address'd, That tore and ravish'd at his crest With ceaseless fury; but it drew Beyond his reaching, when it knew Its comrade worsted, and was fain To wait till it revived again. But Floris, with a doubled hand, Smote at the beast with his good brand So fell a stroke, the sharp death slid Through bone and sinew and forbid Returning life to enter in That loathly dwelling, foul with sin And sloth;—and so the thing was dead. And from the blood its slit veins bled There came to life the blossoms sweet And gold-eyed of the Marguerite, Incoronate with petals white. But that foul serpent with the sight Of that good blow so sorely grieved And fill'd with rage to be bereaved Of its grim comrade was, it threw All fear aside and fiercely flew At Floris, with the armèd sting Of its writhed tail all quivering In act to strike, and with so strong A swoop the dart did thrust and throng Through dent and ring of riven mail, The deadly point it did prevail To bury deep in Floris' breast. Whereat such rage the knight possess'd That all the dolour he forgot (Though very fierce it was, God wot, And sad) and throwing down his blade, With such a mighty force he laid To drag that scorpion from his side, The serpent's tail in twain he wried And in such hideous wounds it rent, That from the body coil'd and bent With anguish it must needs divide. Wherewith the cleft did open wide, And such a flood therefrom did flow Of blood upon the herbs below That needs it seem'd the flowers must die; And with the pain so fierce a cry Of agony the dragon gave, There is no heart of man so brave And firm but he must quake at it. And now the doom of death was writ In heaven for that unholy beast; And in a little while it ceased To cry, and down upon the ground It fell and died; and all around The firm earth quaked. And as it died, The blood—that wither'd far and wide The herbs and 'mid the stalks did boil For rage—was dried into the soil; Wherefore there sprang from out the stain The holy purple of vervain, The plant that purgeth earth's desire. Now may Sir Floris well aspire To have that peace he needeth so And easance after toil and woe: For there is none to fight with him Of all those beasts so fell and grim; Nor any sign of further foe Within the garden is, I trow, To let him from his victory; And all around the place was free From fear; the breezes were a-tune Again with birdsongs, and the boon Of scent within the flowers once more Was golden, nor the heavens wore The hue of horror and dismay: And so he may be blithe and gay And have sweet pleasance. But alas! No thought of this for Floris was. Within his veins the venom 'gan To curdle and the red blood ran With frozen slowness, as the sting Of pain went ever gathering Fresh fierceness through him. Very nigh It seem'd to him he was to die. He felt the chills of the last hour Creep through him and the deathsweats pour Adown his brow: such agony Along his every vein did flee, He could no longer up endure, Nor hope for any aid or cure; But down upon the earth he sank Aswoon, with faded lips that drank The dews of death, and with a prayer Half mutter'd in his last despair, The sense forsook him. So he lay Aswoon, poor knight, and (well-a-way!) Most like to die. But there was thought In heaven for him that thus had fought; For that fair garden's sake. The love Of the dear God that dwells above Was mindful of him, though he knew It not. And so to him there drew A tender dream,—as there he lay Smitten to death with that fierce fray,— And fill'd his thought; and it did seem To him, by virtue of the dream, That over him an angel stood, And with a sweet compassion view'd His piteous state, and whiles did strew Soft balms upon him, strange and new Unto his sense,—so comforting And sweet of scent, they seem'd to bring To him the airs of Paradise; And with their touch the horrent ice Of death, that bound his every sense, Was melted wholly; and the tense And cruel anguish, that untied The threads of living, did subside; And gradually peace came back Into his spirit, and the rack Of pain and agony from him Was lifted. So upon the rim Of the sad soul a little life Began to hover, as at strife With Death, reluctant to forego His late assurèd prey; and so The breath came back by slow degrees To the spent soul, and in great ease Awhile he lay, and whiles he dream'd He was in heaven, and it seem'd He heard the golden harpings stir The air to glory and the choir Of seraphim, that stand around The throne, with one sweet pulse of sound Coörder'd, lift descant of praise To Him that is the Lord of Days And Ancient. Then he seem'd to hear A voice that murmur'd in his ear— As 'twere a ring of broken chords Angelic, mingled with sweet words (So silver-clear it was)—and bade Him open eyes: and then one laid Soft hand upon his lids and drew The darkness from them. So the blue Of heaven again was visible To him, as 'twere some great sweet bell Of magic flowerage in some prime Of summer in old fairy-time: And drinking slowly use of light And sense of life and its delight Back into eyes and brain, he turn'd His gaze from where the heaven burn'd With full sweet summer, and was ware Of a fair champion standing there, Past mortal beauty. All in white And spotless mail was he bedight, So clear that there is nothing fair And goodly but was mirror'd there, And yet no evil thing nor sad Was there. Upon his helm he had A fair gold cross, and on his shield The semblance of a lamb did wield A fair gold cross. Upon his crest The snows of a fair plume did rest And wave; and eke his pennoncel Was white as is the new-blown bell Of that frail flower that loves the wind, And round his dexter arm was twined A snow of silk. Full glorious The splendour of his harness was, And wonder-lovely to behold: But as white silver and red gold Are pale beside the diamond, So was his visage far beyond His arms in glory and delight Of beauty. There was such a might Of stainless virtue and of all Perfection pictured, and withal So wondrous tender in aspèct He was, it seem'd as if the Elect Of Christ on earth in him did live; That, with glad eyes, men might arrive, Beholding him, to know the love And gentilesse of God and prove In him the sweetness of that grace Which shinèd ever in Christ's face On earth. And so in very deed It seem'd to Floris that the need Of earth was over, and his soul Was won thereto where life is whole— Withouten any stress or dole— At last in joyance, and his eyes Did view, in robes of Paradise, That tender angel of the Lord, That into men's sore bosoms pour'd Sweet balms and comfort, being set To temper justice and the fret Of life with love most pitiful. And whilst he thus did gaze his full Upon the radiance of that wight, The soft and undefiled delight, That in his visage held full sway, So purged all Floris' awe away And eke such boldness to him gave That he was fain of him to crave His name. Then, “I am Galahad, Christ's knight,” he said. Whereat full glad Was Floris, and all reverently Unto the earth he bent his knee Before the knight, and (an he list) Would fain the broider'd hem have kiss'd Of his white robe; but Galahad Did raise him quickly up and bade Him henceforth kneel to God alone, That on the height of Heaven's throne Is for man's soul the only one Of worship, save sweet Christ, His Son, And Mary mother pitiful; And henceforth were no kings that rule So blest as Floris now should be, Since that with such high constancy And noble faith he had withstood The shock of that unholy brood And in fair fight had vanquish'd them. Wherefore for crown and diadem Of triumph, on the greensward freed From those foul beasts that there did bleed Their life away beneath his blade, In goodly order were array'd For him those pleasant blooms and fair, That not alone so debonair And blithe of aspect were, but eke Had virtues—more than one might speak In wearing of a summer's day— For purging fleshly lusts away And cleansing from his heart—who wore Their beauty fairly—all the sore Sad doubts and weariness of earth, That so with an immortal mirth And constant faith his soul was glad, And evermore sweet peace he had In love of God and eke of Christ, The which against all ills sufficed Of mortal life. And as he spoke, From the slight stems those flowers he broke That 'midst the herbage did entreat The eye with blossom very sweet And gracious; and (O wonderment!) Being in his hand conjoin'd, they blent Their essences in such rare wise, It seem'd from each sweet bell did rise A sweeter perfume, and more bright Their semblance grew, as 'twere some might Of amity was moved in them— Being so join'd into one stem— To heighten each one's loveliness With all its fellows did possess Of blithe and sweet. And therewithal, When from the grass those flow'rets all Were gather'd, to Sir Floris came That noblest knight, and in Christ's name, With fairest look and friendliest speech, Him of his kindness did beseech That he from him those blooms would take And breathe their fragrance. Scarce awake From swoon was Floris yet; and so He took them with dull hands and slow, And did address himself to scent Their breath, as one half indolent With sleep; but when the gracious smell Was won to him, that from each bell Did float and hovering was blent Into some wondrous ravishment, There overcame him such a sense Of gladsome ease and recompense Of all his labours, that the dull Gross drowsiness, that did annul The soul within the man, forsook Him wholly; and withal he took Such gladness, that in every vein The life seem'd blithely born again; And through his frame so fresh a flood Of ardour pour'd, it seem'd the blood— That in men's pulses sluggishly Doth throb and flutter—was made free From earthly baseness and was turn'd To heavenly ichor. For there burn'd Within him such a fire of hope, He felt his soul no more did grope Within the dreary dusk of earth, But on the wings of a new birth Toward the highest heaven did soar. Nor was there for him any more A thought of weariness or woe; But from the earth he rose and so Was ready for all venturing And all the quest of holy thing God might appoint him. Then that knight, That was apparell'd all in white,— Most brightly smiling at the new Glad ardour that did straight ensue In Floris with those blossoms' scent And at the holy joy that brent Upon the dial of his face,— Within his arms did him embrace And kiss'd him very lovingly. Then in this wise to him spake he, With grave sweet speech. “Beyond the brine, Where in the Orient first the sign Of dawn upon the sky is set,— In that sweet clime where men forget The winter and the summer lies So lovingly upon the skies, That of a truth the very night Is lucent and the cruel spite Of darkness never wholly hides The flowers, but aye some light abides, Wherefore men call it morning-land,— A fair and stately house doth stand, Wherein, by help of God His grace, Unto my lot it fell to place That holy token of the Lord, Which He to mortals did afford Awhile on earth to look upon For consolation; but anon, Moved to slow anger by their sin And stubborn wickedness, within His mystery He did withdraw The blessèd thing: but yet the law Of that sad doom He temperèd— Of His great grace and kindlihead— With mercy. For it was ordain'd That if one kept himself unstain'd And pure from every lust and sin, A virgin, he should surely win And come to taste of that sweet food Of the Redeemer's flesh and blood. And unto me such grace was given That of all champions who have striven I have been chosen from the rest For winning of the Holy Quest; Since that, as in the Writ we read, God of the humblest may indeed Be pleased to make His instrument, Even unto me that joy was sent, Surpassing all that of old time Is told for us in minstrels' rhyme Of Heaven's mercy: and God wot, Were passèd o'er Sir Lancelot And sweet Sir Tristram, that again The world shall never of those twain Behold the like, such debonair And perfect gentle knights they were. Wherefore to God it seemèd fit That a fair dwelling over it Should for its safe keeping be built: And that no breath of sin or guilt Might there approach, there was enroll'd A band of knights, in whom the gold Of virtue had been smelted out And purified from sin and doubt By toil and venture perilous. And in that high and holy house In goodly fellowship they dwell, Until to God it seemeth well— For long good service done—to call One of the brethren from the thrall Of earthly life and with His blest In Paradise to give him rest. Wherefore, when one is call'd away, It is ordain'd that from the grey Of the sad world another knight— To fill his place who, benedight, Has won the guerdon of his strife— Be chosen out, to cast off life And with much labour and much pain Be purified from earthly stain And tried with woe. If he endure And from the furnace come out pure Of sin and lusting, he shall stand For the dead brother in the band Angelical and shall be set With those that, pure of earthly fret, Do guard the shrine miraculous. In such a wise enrollèd was Sir Percivale; and Lohengrin By like adventuring did win Among the holy knights to sit; And many more of whom ye wit. And lately it the Lord hath pleased That yet another should be eased Of his long service and preferr'd Among the angels to be heard And scent the breath of heaven's rosen. And in his stead hast thou been chosen In much hard strife to be assay'd And for Christ's service fitting made. Wherefore this venture has been given To thee, in which thou now hast striven So wonder-well, that thou mightst win To purge thyself of earthly sin. And having in good sooth prevail'd Against all dangers that assail'd Thee and this garden's purity, There is great bliss ordain'd for thee; For that thy name shall be enroll'd Among those knights in ward that hold The blessed Grail; and thou with me Beyond the billows of the sea Shalt come to where that house is fair Withouten any pain or care, And shalt awhile taste heaven's bliss And on thy mouth shalt have the kiss Of Christ the Lord, that doth assoil All weariness of earthly toil And giveth to all sorrows peace Undying.” So the strain did cease Of his sweet speaking, and awhile The very sweetness of his smile Did hinder Floris from reply: And eke the thought of bliss so nigh His lips and all the ravishment Of promise that he did prevent In his imagining and lack Of words for utterance held back His tongue from speaking anything. But Galahad for answering Stay'd not, but, with a doubled grace Of sweet assurance in his face, Began to say, in very deed, That presently there was great need They should withouten more delay Toward the dawning take their way, For many a mile the voyage was And for great distance tedious. Then Floris said to him, “Fair knight, That in whole armour of pure white Dost serve God in all chastity, I prithee, lightly show to me How we may gain that distant land That by the rising sun is scann'd,— Since here no manner boat is had?” Whereat no word spake Galahad, But with his hand the sign he made, That makes all evil things afraid And compasses all good about With armour against sin and doubt; And straightway with the holy sign A white cross in the air did shine A second, as for answering; And then the stream's soft murmuring Grew louder to the sweep of waves Along the reed-crests and the glaives Of rushes, and its silver thread Into a river's mightihead Was stretch'd; and on the stream did float The silver wonder of a boat, Gold-keel'd and fair with silken sails, Such boat as, in old Eastern tales, The genii bring at the command Of some enchanter's magic wand. And on the prow of cymophane— Translucent as the pearly wane Of that fair star that rules the night, With an internal glory bright— The milk-white holy bird did sit And spread soft pinions over it, That flutter'd for desire of flight. Therein stepp'd Galahad, Christ's knight; And after him did Floris come At beckoning, wholly dazed and dumb With wonders of that wondrous time. And as into the stern did climb The valiant knight, the soft sweet wind That 'mid the blossom'd trees was twined, Ceased from its disport in the flowers And leafage of those magic bowers, And with such strong yet gentle stress Within the silken sails did press Toward the dawning, that the keel Slid through the waters blue as steel As swiftly as the morning sun Shears through the mists when night is done And day is golden in the sky. And as it through the lymph did fly Of that enchanted rivulet, The golden keel to song did fret The thronging currents, and the break Of waves on murmurous waves did make Rare music in the diamond deeps, Such music as the West wind sweeps From out the harps of Fairyland, When elves are met on some sweet strand Of Broceliaund or Lyonesse, For revel and for wantonness. On all sides round them as they went The dim grey woods were sad and spent With weariness of winter-time, And in the fields the rugged rime Held all things in the sleep of death, Stern white and void of living breath; And with the weary weight of snow The laden boughs were bent and low. But in their sails a breath there blew Of April zephyrs, and there drew Unto their course a summer cloud With scents of flowers and birdsongs strow'd; And echoings of July woods— When in the green the bluebell broods— Were thick and sweet about their way, And ever round the boat's prow lay The scent of grass-swaths newly mown; And wildflowers in gold grain and brown Waved in the sweet dream-haunted air. So went they,—while the night was bare Of sound or breath to break the sleep Of winter,—through the woodlands deep, And past the well-remember'd plains And towns and meadows, where the lanes And streets were hush'd with winter-time,— And saw no creature on the rime, Save some stray sheep shut out from fold Or wolf, that from his forest hold Was by hard hunger forced to seek Scant prey upon the moorlands bleak. So ever without cease they sped Above that swift sweet river's bed; And truly, as the golden morn From out the russet mists was born And all things 'gan to wake from sleep, They heard the silver rush and sweep Of waves upon a pebbled shore; And gliding past the marish frore, They came to where the river's tide Was fleck'd with foam, and near and wide The main, as far as eye could see, Slept in a sweet serenity. Far out to seaward fled their boat, Across the wild white flowers that float And blossom on the azure leas; And swiftly as the culver flees Among the trees with shadow twined, They left the frozen fields behind And saw the spangled foam divide The firmament on every side. The golden calm of summer seas Was there, and eke the July breeze That waves upon the silver foam, When in the azure heaven's dome The sign of summer-prime is set: And still no winds opposed they met, Nor break of billows in their way; But through the dancing ripples' play The shallop sped toward the dawn, As by some starry influence drawn, Over the ridges of the main Unstirr'd and clear. And still the rain Of blossoms fell about the stem, And still sweet odours breathed on them Of rose and jasmine, and the song Of birds about the sail was strong. So over silver seas they went, And heaven, wide-eyed for wonderment, Hung o'er them open blue the while, As though all nature were asmile To see the goodly way they made: And ever round the sharp keel play'd The fretted lacework of the foam, And through the jewell'd deeps did roam Great golden fish, and corals red Waved in the dim sweet goodlihead Of that clear blue; and through the wave The shells of many a rich cave Were visible, wherein the sea Held in a sweet security Treasures of pearl and lovely gold, That eye of man might ne'er behold Until the main should leave its bed; And over all the deeps was shed A glancing play of emerald light, So that the unembarrass'd sight Pierced through the cool sweet mystery Of folded billows, and the eye Was free in shadows jewel-clear. Nor was there anything of fear For them in lapse of hyaline Or silver breakers of the brine; Nor in the crystals of the air Was anything but blithe and fair, Sweet winds and glitter of fair birds, Whose song was sweeter than sweet words Between the pauses of a kiss, When lovers meet in equal bliss. So many a day they sail'd and long, Lull'd by the breezes' flower-sweet song And pipe of jewel-birds that went Above them, fair to ravishment; Until, one morn, athwart the lift Of blue was visible a rift Of purple mountain; and a spire Of amethyst rose ever higher Into the sapphire firmament. And drawing nigh, they saw where blent Its silver currents with the blue Of that bright ocean, blithe to view, A fair clear river that outpour'd Its waters 'twixt soft green of sward And slope of flower-besprinkled banks, Where rushes stood in arching ranks, Tipt with a jewel of fair flower As blue as is the morning hour, When in the golden prime of May The sweet dawn blends into the day. The swift keel slid between the rows Of ripples,—as a steed that knows The road of some familiar place,— And past the bubbled foamy race Of eddies, through the sapphire cleft Of that bright pass, and quickly left The billows of the sea behind, As on that goodly stream the wind Did urge it far into the land. Surely was never kingdom spann'd On earth by river such as this, Where ever some enchanted bliss Ran in the ripples, and the stream With liquid gold and pearl did seem To glitter. There is nought more fair Beneath the regions of the air Than this same river; nor in all Birdnotes is aught more musical Than the delight of its clear flow Across the pebbles, soft and low. And in the banks were wondrous things, All lovely creatures that bear wings; And every precious thing of green, And flower of gold and jewell'd sheen, Was there in such a perfect shape, Its essence must full needs escape The grasp of my poor minstrelsy. The very grass was fair to see Beyond the fairest flower of earth; For with the gold of some new birth It burnt, and was aflame with bright Sweet gladness. Very flames of light The flowers seem'd, zaffiran and blue And crystal-clear with wonder-dew. It seem'd their scent so heavenly was, That into music it must pass And soar into a perfumed song. And as the boat was borne along The golden ripples, in its speed Dividing many a woven weed, That with its many-colour'd mesh Of trailing leaves and flowers did stretch And wave upon the waters bright,— Sir Floris, with what prayers he might, That gracious Galahad besought That from his lips he might be taught What was that river and that realm, That all earth's sweets did hide and whelm In one etern forgetfulness, And made all joys that men possess Seem poor and naught with the delight Of its exceeding lovely might. And without pausing, Galahad To him made answer fair and glad. “Fair knight, this land through which we pass, About the city of Sarras Doth lie; and all the golden plain Beyond thy vision, for demesne— By grace and favour of high Heaven— Unto the Holy Town was given, Where lies in hold the blessed Grail.— Before from Paradise did fail Adam and Eva for their sin, These happy fields and glades within The golden gates of Eden were, Wherein was nothing but was fair: And this same river of those four Was one, that of old times did pour Blithe waters over all the plain, When life was young and free from stain, And angels walk'd upon the earth. And (for their flow) came never dearth Of kindly fruits nor any drought Of summer-time the place about; Nor for the warmth of their clear flood Might winter nip the flowery bud Of the perpetual spring, that rain'd Fresh blossoms there; nor ever waned The balms of summer in the air, But evermore the place was fair With all May-sweets and summer-spells. And still,—although the cloister'd dells Of the lost garden no more stand Upon the peace of the fair land,— Around its precincts, as of old, A silver stream with sands of gold Flows ever, which no foot of man, Or eye, without Christ's leave, can span; Of all the four the only one That still with murmurous waves doth run In the old channel. Very fair Its marges are with all things rare; And over all the land is strown Thick bdellium and the onyx-stone.” And many another wondrous thing Unto Sir Floris, listening, Spake Galahad of that fair land, That eye of man hath never scann'd, Save he have won to Christ His grace. And as he spoke, came on apace The tender day and gilded all The ripples; and the golden ball Of the sweet sun rose high in heaven; And unto every thing was given New ravishment and new delight Of very waking. Fairer sight Saw mortal never (nor indeed So fair within our earthly need Is compass'd) than the morning hour That open'd into full sweet flower With many a rosy flush and rain Of golden sunlight over plain And mead, and many a tender shade Kiss'd into warmth—that in green glade Lay waiting for the frolic light— And changed to fleecy gold the white Of dawn-clouds over hill and wold. It was so gracious to behold The day in that sweet Paradise, There is no man with mortal eyes Could drink its beauty wholly in, For dust of care and mirk of sin That hide much loveliness from men. And Floris ever and again Was dumb with awe of much delight And wonderment; as with swift flight The boat sped through the flowers that shone With blazon'd gold and blue upon That magic river of a dream, He sat and stored the influence Of the lush balms within his sense, And watch'd the ripples all agleam With jewels, and the constant smile Of the sweet sunlight. And the while The songs of birds co-ordinate And zephyrs with a peace so great And sweet upon his soul did seize, And whiles his spirit had such ease In that sweet speech of Galahad, He needs forgot that aught of sad Or dreary in this life is set, Or weariness of earthly fret; And did, without a backward glance, Yield up himself into the trance Of that new joy. So sped they on Toward the orient: and anon,— Whenas the noon was borne along The midmost heaven, to the song Triumphal of the joyous choir Of birds and breezes, ever higher Soaring in one sweet antiphon,— There rose in the sweet sky—upon The fair broad hem of woven gold, That marged with many a fleecy fold The sapphire-chaliced firmament— A glitter of tall spires, that brent With an unearthly radiance; And many a jewel-colour'd lance Of belfry pierced the golden air On the horizon; and there bare The wind to them a strain of song Ineffable, the stream along— Faint for great distance—that for joy And triumph over earth's annoy With such a rapturous sweetness smote On Floris, he could neither note The kingdom's varied loveliness Nor the sweet antiphonal stress Of winds and birds and rivulet, But it alone could hear, nor let Himself from striving up to it; For with its melody was knit About his soul an influence So strong, it seem'd his every sense Must press toward it. Nay, at last, For ecstasy he would have cast Himself headlong into the stream, That therewithal, as he did deem, He might the swiftlier win toward That wondrous singing and the ward Of that bright town miraculous. But Galahad the good knight was Mindful of him, and by his arm Withholding him therefrom, did charm His soul with such sweet words, that he Must for a while contented be To wait the progress of the boat, That very speedily did float, God wot, across the ripples' race, To where the turrets of the place Were clear. And so they came at last To where the running river pass'd From the long lapse of pleasant wood And meadow with enchantments strew'd Of flowers and sun-gold, and were ware Of the bright town that all the air With towers and pinnacles did fill, Set on the slope of a soft hill, That in the sun wore one clear hue Of purple blending into blue, Most like a great sweet amethyst. And now the gunwale softly kiss'd The golden shore; and thick with gem And coral, round the entering stem Was wrinkled up the glittering sand. Then Galahad upon the strand Stepp'd lightly out; and as his feet Upon the grainèd gold did meet Of the rich shingle, there was borne To them the noise of a blown horn, That was as if a warder blew To challenge from some tower of view Within the amber-gated town; Wherefrom to them it floated down And fill'd the air with echoings So sweet, there is no bird that sings Could find such music in his throat Melodious. And as the note Of welcome swell'd and waned around The hollows of the hills,—unwound From his mail'd breast Sir Galahad A silver horn he thereon had In its white baldrick, and therein Breathing, its hollow bell did win Unto so sweet an answering blast, It seem'd to Floris that at last He heard the trumps angelical. Then at the silver clarion's call The beryl gates were open'd wide Of the fair town; and on the side Of the soft hill there was to them Made visible—upon the hem Of woven grass with lilies strew'd And asphodels—a multitude Of holy knights, that down the sward In a bright painted pageant pour'd, With many a waving pennoncel Of gold and azure; and the swell Of clarions, co-ordinate To mystic harmonies, did wait, With cadences most grave and sweet, Upon the rhythm of their feet. So goodly were they of aspèct And in such pictured raiment deck'd Of say and samite, there is none, Minstrel or bard, beneath the sun, That could have sung of their array As it befits to sing it,—nay, Not even he who many a day In Fäerie enchanted lay And learnt full many a year and long The cadences of elfin song, True Thomas; nor that couthliest wight In gramarye, that Merlin hight. Full bright their arms and lucent were And of a sheen so wonder-fair, The sun seem'd of a nobler kind To glitter, when his splendours shined Upon the silver-mirror'd mail. And at the sight of them did fail Sir Floris' courage, that till now Had never seen thing high enow To give him pause; for there did come So strange a fear on him, that dumb And cold he grew, and haply might Have swoon'd indeed for sheer affright Of wonder and great reverence That lay upon his every sense. Forsooth, awhile the blood did leave Its courses and great awe did weave Strange terrors in him; and with pain And fear despiteous, he was fain To hide his visage from the might Of that much brightness. Then that knight, Sir Galahad, laid hands on him, And quickly freed him from the grim Sad grasp of that unreal fear, And bade him that of right good cheer He should become, for knighthood's sake, And for his honour comfort take And new stout heart; for shame it was And pity, one so valorous And bold in arms should faint and fail, Where he most surely should prevail, 'Midst those that now his comrades were And fellow-knights; and with much fair Discourse did win him from affright, So that at last he dared the sight Of those fair knights and saw they gazed Right courteously on him and praised His hard-won victory. So he took New heart, and with assurèd look Leapt out upon the jewell'd sand: And as the twain were come to land, From those knights all so sweet a sound Of songful greeting did resound, The blue of heaven could never tire Of answer; and from many a lyre And cithern the alternate joy Of harpings join'd in sweet alloy Its silver with that golden song. So Floris was among that throng Of knights received, with many a kiss And glad embracement: nor, ywis, Fail'd Galahad that he should name Each knight that to the greeting came. To him was Titurel made known, And Percivale, to whom was shown— With Bors—such grace of God most high, By reason of much purity, That they alone with Galahad Upon the earthly questing had The blessed vision of the Grail: Nor Lohengrin to him did fail; And many another noble knight Of fabled prowess and approved In gentilesse and all Christ loved, Did there rejoice him with his sight. So, for the meed of his good fight, Into the wonder-town they bare Sir Floris,—wherein many a rare Delight to him appointed was. Bright was the place and glorious With glory of the abiding love Of God and Christ, that is above All splendours marvellous and fair; And luminous its ramparts were With pearls and rubies constellate And diamonds into such state And harmony as, save in heaven, Unto no place or thing is given To wear or look on: such a blaze Of joy was there, without amaze; For all was easanceful and sweet With Christ His grace. The very feet That fell upon the jewell'd stones Compell'd them to such silver tones Of music, and the ruffled air Was stirr'd to harmonies so fair, And for mere passage through the place, Was won to such a subtle grace Of perfume, that therein to be And move was one long ecstasy: And there the dole of earth and stress Of hope unfill'd and weariness Was purged, and life was one delight Of perfect function, by the might Unfailing of the doubtless soul; And every act and thought was whole In striféless àccord. If one spoke, The hinder'd voice no longer broke Into harsh sadness, spent and wried With weary effort, but did glide Into an unconstrain'd consent Of harmony and ravishment Unstressful; and the every geste Was with like subtle grace possess'd, And every faculty was cast In symmetry, whát time one pass'd The portals of the place and heard The echoes of his feet that stirr'd The holy quiet. So the spell Of the charm'd place on Floris fell Transfiguringly, as the wide Gold-trellised leaves on either side Swung back for him: there came a change Upon his senses and a strange Sweet ease of life, as if the soul, Way-worn and rusted with the dole And fret of earth, were softly riven From him, and in its stead were given To him a new and perfect one, In a whole body as the sun Lucent and worthy for the seat Of the fair spirit. Up the street, Gold-paven and with chrysolite And jacinth marged, they brought the knight, Past many a goodly hostelry And many a dwelling fair to see, Unto a portal sculptured all With handiwork angelical, In stories of the love of Christ, And all the times it hath sufficed To win sad living to much ease;— And passing on with harmonies Of choral song, they came unto A vaulted courtyard, stretching through A cloister'd vista to fair halls Of alabaster, where the walls With many a colour'd crystal shone Of jewell'd casement; and thereon The questing of the Holy Grail, In many a wonder-lovely tale, Was with bright gold and wonderment Of colour'd jewel-fretwork blent To harmony, depicturèd. And there, in truth, Sir Floris read,— Beside much other venturing And many another goodly thing Achieved in service of the Lord,— The fight that he with his good sword Had in the wonder-garden fought. Nor, therewithal, was missing aught Of all that did that night befall To him: but there upon the wall Was in bright colours pictured forth The tale of all his knightly worth And service. Little strange it is If much he wonder'd was at this And could for wonder scarce believe His eyes, that any should achieve So vast a work and of such grace And splendour in so scant a space Of time. But Lohengrin besought Him very fairly that of nought He saw he should be wonderèd, Nor any venture have in dread; Since that to that high Lord, that there Did reign, all wonders easy were And wonderless; nor of His grace Was anything in all that place That might avail for any fear Or doubt, but rather to give cheer And love and confidence was fit, So sweet a peace did dwell in it Of amity and holiness. Then with slow feet they did address Their further steps,—by a long aisle Of cloister'd pearl, wherethrough the smile Of sunlight filter'd lingeringly And lay in one sweet soften'd sea Of gold upon the silver mail,— Toward the temple of the Grail. And in a vestibule, that was Thereto adjacent, did they pause And in fair garments clad the knight, With silver radiant and white. And then into an armoury They led him, very fair to see With noble weapons, all arow Against the wainscot. There a snow Of plumes upon his crest they bound, And from the swords that hung around A goodly blade was given him, That, to the sound of many a hymn And many a golden litany, Had in the glorious armoury Of highest heaven forgèd been: So trenchant was it and so keen,— Being in celestial fires assay'd And in strange dews of heaven made Attemper'd,—there might none withstand The thunderstroke of that good brand, Except his bosom armour'd were With equal virtue. Then the fair Graven presentment of a dove With eyes of gold was set above His helm,—most like the fowl that brought Him to the garden where he wrought Such deeds of arms; and on the field Cœrulean of his virgin shield There was a like resemblant set, That men might know him, when they met In sharp sword-play or battle-throng. Then, with a ripple of soft song, The golden doors were backward roll'd, That in sweet mystery did fold The holy place; and Floris came Into a hall, where with a flame Of jewell'd light the air was gilt; And therewithin the walls were built Of that clear sapphire jewelry That can in nowise elsewhere be Save for the pavement of the sky And for the throne of God most high. And under foot the floor was bright With one clear topaz, as the light Of the sweet sun in hue. Above There was y-sprad a flower-bell roof Of that sweet colour of deep blue One in the spring may chance to view, When in the golden-threaded moss The deep wood-dells are odorous With violets and the cluster'd bells Of bee-loved hyacinths, or else The deep clear colours pers and inde Of wild-flowers in the gold corn twined With many a tassel of bright blue, When summer in the skies is new.— And in the bell were golden lights, Most like the tender eye-delights Of the gold kingcups in the green, That in quaint wise were set between The fretted azure of the dome. And therethorough did meteors roam, As 'twere in truth the very heaven, And the sweet symbols of the seven Great angels that do rule the skies Were therein jewell'd. In such wise The varied lights were mixt and blent With those that heavenward were sent From walls and pavement,—all the air Was with that lightsomeness most fair And tender fill'd, that in the May Is weft about the sweet young day, When whiles it seems the sky is dight With one great primrose of soft light, Most pure and tender. On the ground There stood fair statues all around, Deep-set in woven flowers and green Of lavish leafage, stretch'd between Tall carven pillars of that bright Jewel that chrysoberyl hight, And many another precious stone. Nor there were images alone Of holy things, as one might deem; But eke full many a lovely dream Of tender love and constancy Was in clear gold and ivory With loving hand made manifest. For there was nothing there confess'd Of sin or wantonness in love,— As ancient doctors teach, that prove All pleasant things that are to be Unloved of God. And verily Sir Floris wonder'd there to see The histories that makers tell Of Parisate and Floridelle, The tale of Tristan and Ysolde, Of Lancelot and Guenevere, And many another tale of old, That men on earth do dully lere That we should count accurst and ill: But there depictured were they still, In very piteous fashion told; And on the wall in words of gold Was writ this legend, “Quiconque aime Complait a Dieu en pechié mesme.” And while Sir Floris stood and gazed Upon the statues,—much amazed At all that he did hear and see Within the temple,—suddenly There was a fluted singing heard, As of some wonder-lovely bird. And then one took him by the hand And led him where a gold screen spann'd The topaz paved work of the floor. Then was he ware of a high door, That with much wonderwork of gold And unknown metals was enscroll'd In many a trellis of fair flowers And fronds enough fair for the bowers Of Paradise; and in the leaves There sat a bird, that was as sheaves Of ripen'd corn in hue, and sang— That therewithal the temple rang— Of unknown glories of the May, Therein where life is one long day Of spring and never change is there, Nor any sadness in the air. And as he sang, the golden gate Swung open slowly, and the great Sweet hollow of a pure white pearl Lay clear behind that golden merle, Into a chamber fashionèd. There was an altar built and spread With tapestry of silver white, Woven with lilies; and thereon Was set a chalice, out of one Great emerald moulded,—with samite, The colour of the heart's best blood, Enshrouded; and thereover stood A great white cross and fill'd the air With living radiance, as it were A sculptured work of very light. Then with the wonder of the sight Was Floris fill'd; and for great awe And reverence of all he saw Within the pearl, straightway he fell Upon his knees. But Titurel With counsel very fair and wise Required of him that he should rise From off the ground and without fear Unto the altar should draw near And for an offering thereon Should lay those blossoms he had won In parlous fight and much duresse, That of their blended goodliness And eke their perfume's ravishment, There might a sacrifice be sent, To God and Christ acceptable. And now a wondrous thing befell, (God grant us all the like to see); For as Sir Floris reverently Upon the silver cloth did lay The holy flowers (that, sooth to say, Were bright of bloom and sweet of scent, Unfaded, as when first they sprent The greensward) and withdrawing thence A little space, in reverence The issue did await,—there came A hand all shapen out of flame, And from the emerald of the cup The crimson samite lifted up; And as this thing was done, there fell— As 'twere from out the midmost bell— A light that through the emerald sped And mingled with the holy bread; And with the light, came one that pass'd Thought-swift athwart the air and cast Himself into the cup,—as 'twere The angel of a child,—most fair And awful. Wherewithal thereout There went a fire the place about, And fill'd the temple with its breath, Wherein was neither hurt nor death; But of its contact there were given To Floris very balms of heaven For consecration; and to eat There was vouchsafed him food so sweet And goodly such as no man knows. Then from the chaliced gem there rose The semblance of a face, that was With such a splendour glorious And awful—and withal as mild And tender as a little child— There is no bard can sing of it As it befitteth, save he sit (And hardly then) among the choirs, That to the throb of golden lyres Do praise God ever night and day With music such as no man may.— There is but one of woman born By whom such aspect can be worn Of perfect love and perfect awe Commingled. And when Floris saw The glory of the eyes and knew The holy love, that like a dew From out their radiant deeps was shed Upon his soul,—for very dread Of ravishment he could not gaze Upon their light, but with amaze And wonderment of joy was fain Down to the earth to bend again His eyes: but ere he ceased to see The vision, of a surety It was made known to him (although He wist not how he came to know) That heavenly face none other was Than that same Lord's who erst did pass Before his vision in the green Of the fair garden, all beseen With glittering hair. Then as he knelt, Unseeing, suddenly he felt Upon his mouth a burning kiss, That with such sharp unearthly bliss His soul did kindle into flame Of ravishment, the wayworn frame Could not for frailty sustain The rapturous ecstatic pain Of that strange joyance, nor the spright Embodied 'gainst the fierce delight Endure of that unearthly boon; And so for bliss he fell aswoon, And heard therein a great sweet voice, That bade him fear not, but rejoice, For Christ the Lord his lips had kiss'd; And therewithal the Eucharist Was borne into his mouth, with sound Of harps angelic all around Soft-smitten; nor therefore did break His charmèd sleep. Then did one speak To him as in the trance he lay, And with a murmurous voice did say, That for the service of that Lord, To whom was sacred now his sword, It was ordain'd that for a space He should return unto his place Upon the earth, and in all things That life on earth to mortals brings, Should for his Master's honour strive, Until the order'd time arrive When God should set him free from soil And weariness of earthly toil. And there was given him a sign When it should please the Lord Divine To make His will beneficent Patent to him,—there should be sent, Twice more before the period set For his release from earthly fret, To him the self-same silver dove, The holy symbol of the love Of Christ and of His chivalry. And it was told him that when he Of the white messenger had wit, He should leave all and follow it: For when it should of him be seen Anew, as it of late had been, He should be ware that God had need Of him elsewhere, in very deed, Upon the earth, and will'd essay His service yet within the way Of living: but what time he heard The thrice-said summons and the bird Miraculous unto him came A third time, in the holy name,— He should, in following, be freed From toil and labour and the need And weariness of day and night, And from the knowledge and the sight Of men be ravish'd, to abide In that fair town beatified And serve the Grail, till it seem'd fit Unto the Lord that he should sit Among the blest in Paradise And praise Him ever. In this wise It seem'd to Floris that one spoke To him with soft sweet speech, that broke His slumber not, as he did lie In that long swoon; and suddenly, The murmur of the speech forsook His hearing wholly; nor with look Or ears awhile was anything Apparent to him, that could bring The wonders of the holy town Back to his senses; but the brown And fleecy-plumaged wings of sleep Inclosed him wholly. In a deep And senseless dream awhile he lay, Until it seem'd to him the gray Of night that compass'd him about Was by a radiance from without Enlumined and the fluted song Of the gold merle again was strong Upon his hearing. Then the dim Gray webs of slumber were from him Unfolded slowly, and there burst A golden light on him. At first The drowsy cumber on his eyes Allow'd him not to recognize The place wherein he was, nor know Wherefrom the amber-colour'd glow Of light was borne: but speedily He was aware that he did lie Upon his bed, and through the fold Of silken tapestries the gold Of the young sun upon his face Was shed; and past the window-space, Without the casement, could he see,— Snow-pure against brown stem and tree,— The charmèd flowerage of that thorn That ever on the Christmas morn Is—for a memory and delight Of the Lord's birth—with blossoms white Transfigurate. And on a spray There sat a mavis brown and grey, That sang as if his heart were shed Into his minstrelsy and fled On wings of music heavenward, A sacrifice of song outpour'd To God most high. Awhile it seem'd To Floris he had surely dream'd The coming of the dove to him And all his strife against the grim Fierce beasts, and all the after-bliss And wonderment, and Christ His kiss. But looking closelier, he was ware At bed-head of his helm that bare A silver dove with eyes of gold, That on the crest did sit and fold White wings above it; and he knew The holy semblant on the blue Of his fair shield, and eke the blade Celestial, by his harness laid Naked at bedfoot. So the doubt Was from his spirit blotted out; And he was surely certified That verily he did abide That wondrous venture and had known Awhile the glories that alone, For those that many a toil have dared In Christ His service, are prepared Within the city of the Grail, Wherein is neither pain nor wail, But ever holiness and peace And ravishment without surcease, In very perfectness of rest. So hath Sir Floris found his quest; And so the tale is told and done Of how, before life's rest was won, The first time unto Floris came The holy dove, in Lord Christ's name. POSTLUDE. THUS far the ancient chronicle I trace; yet much remains to tell Of how Sir Floris in the throng Of men dwelt many a year and long And wrought great deeds and fair with sword And spear in service of the Lord; How love laid hands upon the man, And how, before the years began To sap the life in heart and limb, The dove a third time came to him, And he was strangely borne away Out of this world of night and day, Nor ever more (folk say) since then Was visible to eyes of men. And verily the tale stirs still Within my thought and fain would fill Its purposed course without delay: But now, alack! full many a lay Holds vantage of it in my breast And hinders me from its behest: For we who sing, we may not choose Which we shall take and which refuse Of all the thoughts to us that cry For utt'rance and delivery: But, as desire of battle grows (And will not be denied) in those That love the long clear-sworded fight And the sheer shock of knight on knight Spear-shattering, so the sweet thoughts lie And gather into harmony Within their secret hearts that sing, Until at last the hidden thing Swells up into a sea of song, And out perforce the sweet words throng, Like bird-songs bursting from the brake, When Spring unkisses the flowers' eyes. Yet haply, ere the echo dies Of this my making, I may take The silver-sinew'd lute again And in like measures end the strain Of all that to the knight befell. Till then, fare joyously and well. PRELUDE TO CANTO II OF SIR FLORIS. WHAT is there in this life of ours, Wherein are few of fairest flowers, But hold within their hearts some sting, So wholly fair as love-liking? And what so fit to be the theme Of poets' lays, in their first dream And flush of golden minstrelsy, When not a thing the eye can see Or thought can deem but is transformed By magic phantasy and warmed To lyric sweetness by the glow Of youth and songfulness? I trow It hath been oft reproached to us, Who in the weary world do thus With heart and hand seek to express, In human melodies, the stress Of song and beauty that amid The wild waste whirl of life lies hid, That we too wholly sing of love And set its sweets too much above All other sources of delight And on its radiance jewel-bright Too fondly dwell; wherefore there pass, Unmirrored in our verses' glass, Too many fitter themes of song And therewithal is done much wrong And much neglect to many a thing Of higher worship. We who sing, We hold there is none other theme Than this of love; for we do deem That it all others doth include And holdeth all in servitude; Since there is nought that everywhit Is void of some poor love in it. E'en in the loathly brood of ills, That with such sore embroilments fills Our sordid lives, there is some fair, In envy, hatred and despair, Some far faint trace of loves laid waste And from their proper sphere displaced, To work ill fortune, as all things Most high and holy, that one brings To other than their right fair use, Grow rank and rotten with abuse And from a blessing grow a curse, The better thing to be the worse, Misused. And if a man enquire Of aught wherefrom, within the tire Of this round earth, there may be got Some glow of pleasance, is it not Of Love begot and born of him? The soft star-shimmer on the rim Of heaven and all the bright array Of sun and moon, of night and day, That holds the halls of heaven above, Says not our Dante, “It is Love, “Almighty Love, that moves the sun “And stars?” The clear sweet songs that run Athwart the trellis, when the spring Brings backs delight to every thing, Is it not Love makes linnets sing, Makes brooklets trill and violets blow And every natural thing below The sky that is to be most fair And pleasant? And this Love, whene'er It seizes on one's heart and hand, Will not unbind its silken band Until the thing it wills is done And its commandments every one Wrought out with tongue and soul and song. Wherefore, methinks, the way is long I have to travel in my rhyme, Or e'er I come into a clime Where Love will let me go from him. Nay, where, indeed, but in the dim Domain of Death should one abide, To 'scape his power, the sunny-eyed, Meknoweth not. And now, indeed, As I may hope for Love its meed, There is on me commandment laid Of that high Lord the heavens that made And love-liking thereto, that I Should sing of love and amity. Wherefore there is no living soul That I will stoop to his control, To let me from this theme of mine, How Floris of the wonder-wine Of love drank deep and how he won The fairest maid beneath the sun. Ladies, have heed; this touches you, This song I tune my strings unto, For high sweet striving and delight And true love between dame and knight. CÆTERA DESUNT. THE BUILDING OF THE DREAM. “Or quester est de telle sorte et ordinance qu'à onc homme ayant mis main ès choses du monde des enchantemens et cuydant de puys d'eulx se departir et se retourner à la vie de dessoubs les astres point ne luy sera licite ne fesable mais force luy sera hors de ce monde au plus tost mourir.” Jehan du Mestre, De reg. incant. O Love, that never pardoneth, O Love, more pitiless than Death! His strife is vain that would express Thy sweets without thy bitterness. His toil is vain, for sooth it is One winneth Love through Death his kiss; A man shall never know Love's land Until Death take him by the hand. O bitter Love! this is indeed The evil unto life decreed, That men shall seek thee far and nigh And finding thee, shall surely die. I.DESIRE. THERE dwelt a squire in Poitou of old times, Under the fragrant limes That fringed a city very fair and wide, Set on a green hill-side; And all about the city with its slow Interminable flow, Faint mem'ries murm'ring of a bygone day, A river went, that lay Upon the woven greensward of the fields, In pools like silver shields Of fallen giants flung upon the grass, And round the walls did pass And kiss'd the grey old ramparts of the place With the enchanted grace Of its fair crystal shallows, in the morn Flush'd silver as the thorn Of a May-dawning and when day was done, Rose-ruddy with the sun, That fill'd the arteries of the land with gold. Fair was the place and old Beyond the memory of man, with roofs Tall-peak'd and hung with woofs Of dainty stone-work, jewell'd with the grace Of casements, in the face Of the white gables inlaid, in all hues Of lovely reds and blues. At every corner of the winding ways A carven saint did gaze, With mild sweet eyes, upon the quiet town, From niche and shrine of brown; And many an angel, graven for a charm To save the folk from harm Of evil sprites, stood sentinel above High pinnacle and roof. The place seem'd sanctified by quietude, With some quaint peace imbued; And down its streets the sloping sunlight leant On roof and battlement, Like a God's blessing, loath to pass away, Lingering beyond the day. But seldom came the pomp and blazonry Of clamorous war anigh The calm sweet stead; but there folk came to spend The days of their life's end In strifeless quiet, in the tender haze Of the old knightly days, That bathed the place in legend and romance. Haply, bytimes, a lance Would glitter in the sun, as down the street The mailed knights rode to meet The armies of the king of all the land, And with loud-clanging brand And noise of many a clarion and a horn, The bannerets were borne Before them by their men-at-arms: but yet The walls were unbeset By very war and men look'd lazily Across the plains, to see The far-off dust-clouds, speck'd with points of light, That told of coming fight In the dim distance, where the fighting-men Trail'd, through some distant glen Or round the crown of some high-crested hill, Halberd and spear and bill, And to the walls the echoed sound would come Of some great army's hum And clank of harness, mix'd with trumpet-clang. And now and then there rang At the shut gates a silver clarion's call, And the raised bridge would fall To give some knight night's harbourage, who went To a great tournament Or act of arms in some far distant town Beyond the purpled brown Of the great hills. But else the quiet place Slept in a lazy grace Of old romance and felt the stress and need Little in very deed Of the great world, that compass'd it about With many a woe and doubt Unknown to it. Yea, for the quietness And peace that did possess The town, had many a learned clerk, that sought Deep in the mines of thought, Made to himself a home within the walls; Among the ancient halls Wrought many a limner, famous in the land, And many an one with hand Well skill'd to sweep the lute-strings to delight, And crafty men that write Fair books and fill the marge with painted things, Gold shapes of queens and kings, Fair virgins sitting in bird-haunted bowers, And every weed that flowers From spring through summer to the waning year,— Here without let or fear These all did dwell and wrought at arts of peace. And there, too, dwelt at ease This squire of Poitou. Ebhart was his name; One not unknown to fame In the old days, when he was wont to rear Banner and banner'd spear Before great knights and rend the thickest press Of foemen with the stress Of his hot youth. Of old, in very deed, There once had been much rede Of his fair prowess and the deeds of arms He wrought with his stout arms Upon the enemies of land and king; And of a truth, no thing Was wanting to the squire but yet one field Of fight, ere on his shield The glorious blazon of a knight should shine, Before the golden sign Of chivalry should glance at either heel And the ennobling steel Fall softly on his shoulder. But that day Was long since past away Out of his thought, and all the old desire Had faded from the squire Of golden spurs and every knightly thing. For, as the years did bring The winterward of life and age began To creep upon the man, Came weariness of strife and wish for rest And thought that peace was best For those whose youth had left them and the first Fresh heat of blood, that burst All bounds and barriers of rugged Fate. Wherefore he did abate His warlike toil, and after many a day He had himself away From the grim strife and clangour of the time Wholly withdrawn, in prime Of later manhood, and in arts of peace Thenceforward without cease His mind had vantaged. And in chief, such quests, As the old alchymists And nigromancers sought, himself he set To follow and forget The ills of living, seeking in old tomes, Heap'd up within the glooms Of scholars' shelves for many a dusty year, To find the words that clear The secret of the mysteries of life And all the problems rife In changeful being, that for aye anew Unto the sage do sue For due solution. Many a year he wrought At these dim quests, and sought— Chiefest of all the hidden things that lie And mock men's fantasy In the recesses of forbidden arts— The mystic lore that parts The soul of man from grinding cares of earth And with a new bright birth More blessèd than the angels maketh him; And had upon the brim Of the strange knowledge trembled many a time, Yet back into the slime Of the old state fell ever, missing aye The thing he did essay By some hair's-breadth of crystal pitiless, That against all his stress Avail'd to stop his passing heavenward. So, many a year he pour'd His strength into the sieve of that strange task, As in a Danaïd's cask, And failing ever, ever hoped anew, And ever did ensue Upon the well-worn path he loved so well; Until, one day, it fell That, studying in an ancient book—fair writ With chymic inks that bit Into the pictured vellum of the page So deeply that with age The words fail'd scarcely, bound with many a hasp And quaintly-graven clasp Of gold and tarnish'd silver,—by some chance Of favouring Fate, his glance, That had been wandering dull and listlessly Amid a prosy sea Of ancient saws and schoolmen's verbiage, Lit on a close-writ page, Whose very aspect made his heart to leap With some strange stirring. Deep And long he search'd the scroll, till on a space Left wide betwixt the grace Of woven flowers and goldwork, that the rim Of the fair script did limn With such bright broidery of lovely hues As ancient folk did use To beautify their pleasant books withal, He read a rescript, all In twisted Greek, contracted to such maze Of crabbèd Proclus-ways, That with much labour hardly could he win To find the sense within The gnarl'd, rude characters. But well repaid For all the toil he laid To the deciphering, in truth, he was; For so it came to pass That as the meaning, veil'd at first and dim, Grew visible to him More and more certainly, the squire was ware That in the scroll a rare And precious secret of the craft lay hid, Cunningly set amid A maze of devious words, that, save to one Long-learn'd and grey-hair'd grown In all the occult arts, must lead the wit Wandering astray from it Among void fancies. But the squire had spent Long years in study, bent Over such books, and so was skill'd in all Devices wherewithal The ancient masters sought their pearls to hide From such profane as tried To fathom their strange mysteries, and keep Their wisdom dim and deep For those alone that of the craftship were; And so, with toil and care, After much labour from the scroll he learn'd The thing for which he yearn'd So many fruitless years; the charm that frees The soul from miseries And joys of life: for it therein was told That, if with virgin gold Won with his sweat and beaten into shoon, Beneath the waxing moon, With his own hands, a man should shoe his horse And braced for a great course, Should fearless ride into the setting sun,— Before seven days were done, He of a truth should come unto a place, Where, with unearthly grace And ravishment, the dreams of his dead youth, In all their lovely sooth Beyond imagining, should be upbuilt Before his eyes, and gilt With all the gold and pearls and flówers that be Within man's fantasy; And there it should be given him to dwell For ever, 'neath the spell Of that unchanging magic of his thought, Wherein no thing unsought For lack of his imagining should fail, Nor any note of wail Nor hum of weary toil should enter there, But in the restful air Life should be painless under dream-blue skies, Lit with the radiant eyes Of that fair queen, whom all in dreams do love, Set in the realms above Our reach, as Dante loved his Beatrice.— And lovelier things than this, Ay, and more wondrous, were recounted there Of how that place was fair And bright beyond man's thought of earthly bliss. So, little strange it is If Ebhart, reading of the things set down Upon the vellum, brown With age, of that old book, grew wonder-glad And for a little had Scarce senses to receive the words he read And all the goodlihead Of promise, that the faithful scroll had held So many a year enspell'd From all but him the master and adept. Hot tears of joy he wept To think there was to him, of all his kind, Alone such bliss assign'd; And presently began his thoughts to set Awork how he should get This thing he yearn'd for: for the man was poor And hardly could procure Fit sustenance. In study had he spent His substance, being bent On his strange hopes past thought of worldly gain. But, as he rack'd his brain, Awhile all fruitlessly, for means whereby He should make shift to buy The needed metal, that came nigh to be The price of a squire's fee, He suddenly bethought him that there yet, Uncharged by any debt, Remain'd to him one little piece of land, Fruitful enough and spann'd By the swift Loire; a little vine-set field Whose fertile soil did yield A dole of daily substance, scant enough For all save those that plough The fields of knowledge; earnt as the reward Of his young blood outpour'd On many a foughten field of sunny France; Which, being sold, perchance Might, with some curious arms he once had gain'd, Whilom when Fortune deign'd To favour him against his foe in fight, Fulfil the sum aright He needed to possess the thing he sought. But if (O woful thought!) His substance being wasted in this wise, His glorious enterprise Should fail, for all his hopes and efforts? Why, What could he do but die? And to a fighter, death was terrorless. While, if the Fates should bless His long desire with the fulfill'd delight, Would not his soul be quite Absolved from life and its ignoble need, Seeing that he should feed On the fair food of an unearthly bliss And with his love's best kiss And in her sight from all the weary dearth And stressfulness of earth Be purified? So either hap might chance, Ill or deliverance, And in no wise should he have need again Of that unlovely bane Of our dull lives, that is our curse and stay, Without which is no way To live nor with it to live happily. Wherefore his land sold he And all his arms, except one suit of mail, Wrought out with many a scale And ring of steel, and his good sword and spear And all the warlike gear He had erst ridden to the battle in, With age and use full thin And rusty grown, but still of temper keen And faithful, having been A right good armourer's work of middle Spain; And with the double gain He bought a lump of virgin gold as large As a Moor's battle-targe, Wherewith to work the magic that he learnt Within the scroll. There burnt Within his breast so uncontroll'd a fire And urgence of desire To fill the measure of his high intent, That scarce the day was spent, Whereon he bought the gold, and in the sky The moon was white and high, Ere to the roof-top of his house he crept, And there, whilst all folk slept, In the full ripple of the flooding light, Did work the livelong night, To fashion out the ore with his own hands Into smooth beaten bands Of wroughten gold, moulding them circle-wise Into such shape and guise As for the seven days' journey should be meet To guard his horse's feet Against the highway's stones. The work did grow Beneath his hands full slow And tediously; for many a year was past Since he had labour'd last At such smith's craft; but yet the earnest will Redeem'd the want of skill, And with much toil at last the squire did make The stubborn gold to take Shoe-shape. All night he wrought beneath the moon, And with the dawn the shoon Fourfold were finish'd, round beyond impeach, Pierced with four holes in each; Nor, for the fitting, unto each did fail The needful golden nail, To clasp the circlet through the holes fourfold. And so it chanced the gold Was wholly spent, to the last glittering grain, Nor did a speck remain Of the thick ore, when the last nail was wrought; Wherefore Squire Ebhart thought The omen fair and braced his heart with it. Then, as the night did flit Across the hilltops in the van of morn And the pale lights were born, That in the dawn do herald the young day, Streaking the cheerless grey Of heaven with their rose and opal woof,— Descending from the roof, Before the daybreak, hastily he clad The harness, that he had Yet left to him, upon his sturdy breast And in his morion's crest Set the strait plume he had been wont to wear In the old days, once fair And flaunting scarlet, but now faded sore. Then did he strike the four Worn shoes of iron from his horse's feet, And in their stead the meet Gold circlets set and beat them firmly on. And now the steed must don His harness and caparisons of war, Such as of old he bore, Chanfrein and poitrail with its rusty spike, Rerebrace and all the like. And so,—the twain addrest in everything For knightly venturing Needful and meet,—the man bestrode his horse; And on the appointed course The old squire sallied forth with his old steed, As over hill and mead The young day came with slow and timorous feet, And the chill air grew sweet With the clear dews and the pure early scent Of the waked flow'rets, blent For incense to the daybreak from the earth; And in the tender birth Of morning all things joy'd, and tunes were strong Of larks' and linnets' song. So, riding through the dim white streets, as yet Unstirr'd by all the fret And hum of daily labour, waking all The echoes with the fall Of his steed's hoofs upon the hilly way, He came to where there lay Before the gate the guardians of the town, Upon the grass thrown down To watch the portal, cross'd with many a bar And bolt of steel. Ajar The wide leaves stood, whilst sleep possess'd the folk So wholly, that the stroke Of the squire's horse-hoofs stirr'd their slumbering But as an echoing Of sound in dreams, nor all his calling roused Them anywise, so drowsed With sleep they were.—And so he thought to make His outward way, nor break The warders' wide-mouth'd rest; but as he strove The ancient gate to move On its dull flanges, clogg'd with all the rust Of many a year, and thrust The half-closed, ponderous leaves apart enough To give him way, the gruff Harsh creaking of the hinge that swung for him,— Breaking upon the dim Sleep-troubled senses of the folk that lay Adream beside the way,— With some faint mimic sound of buckler-clang And foemen's trumpets, rang Within the dull dazed channels of their brain, Snapping the slumberous chain Wherewith the dream-god held their heavy sense In leaden-limb'd suspense; So that they started up from sleep and saw The squire, that in the raw Chill morning dimness pass'd athwart the gate; And wondering thereat, Caught up bright arms and cried to him to stay. But he, upon his way Slackening not, faced round upon his seat, That so their eyes might meet A visage that they knew; and they, for friend Recalling him, did wend Back to their ward, with many a mutter'd oath, Born of their thwarted sloth, 'Gainst him that so untimely broke their sleep. But Ebhart down the steep Of the fair hill rode, all unheeding them, Whilst on the pearlèd hem Of the far sky the dim day brighten'd up Into the azure cup Of the sweet heaven, that lay on field and hill, All rippleless, until Its blue deeps broke upon the purple verge Into a snowy surge Of swan-breast cloudlets, laced with palest gold; And then the shadows roll'd Their mantles round them, and the lingering night Fled from the coming light. And so uprose the golden-armour'd sun And smote the ridges dun Of the deep-bosom'd hills and kindled all Their furrows tenebral Into a wonderwork of luminous spires, Hung with the fretted fires Of dawning, and each crest in the pure light Grew to a chrysolite Of aspiration. On each upland lawn Down fell the dewy dawn And waked the flowers from their green-folded sleep, And o'er each verdant steep Of sloping greensward swept the sun-chased mist, Ruby and amethyst With pitiless sweet splendour. Every wood With the sweet minstrel brood Grew carolful, with, here and there, at first A note, and then a burst Of single song, soon swelling to a sea Of choral ecstasy And thanks for the young day and the delight Of victory o'er the might Of darkness; and each living thing that dwells Within the cool wood-dells Or in the meadows, to the awakening Of that sweet day of Spring Did homage. So rode Ebhart onward, through The cool sweet tender blue Of the fresh springtide dawning, glad at heart, Following the rays that part The morning sky to westward. By the edge, Purple with flower'd sedge, Of the clear stream, whose tinkling currents went Toward the occident, The stout squire fared, through many a thymy field With the fresh heaven ceil'd,— Crush'd with his horsehoofs many a tender flower, That in the sweet dawn hour Open'd its gold and azure eyes from dreams Of the near June's sunbeams, And saw the kine regardant on the grass, That aye, as he did pass Across the greensward on his destrere true, Wet to the hocks with dew, Turn'd their slow heads to gaze upon the twain Awhile, then back again Bent down their muzzles with a lazy grace To the rich pasture-place, Thickset with flowers and juicy herbs. And then,— About the hour when men Are wont to go to labour and the light Across the fields grows white And large with full mid-morn,—the clear stream pass'd The green sweet fields and fast Among the emerald cloisters of a wood Its farther course pursued, Streaking the moss with brown and silver threads And sprinkling the pale beds Of primroses and windflowers, white and blue, With its life-giving dew. And in the ways the light grew dim again; But through the leaves, like rain Of gold, the sunshine broke and fell in showers Upon the upturn'd flowers, Whilst all the birds made carol to the May, Answering the brooklet's lay With choral thanks for all the cool sweet rills It brought them from the hills. And Ebhart, following the river's way, Rode onward through the day Along the fair green lapses of the wood, With many a network strew'd Of frolic sunbeams; and as he did fare, Full often was he ware Of peeping hares and velvet-coated deer That fled as he drew near, And couchant fawns, upon the bracken set For morning sleep, as yet Unknowing fright, that with great fearless eyes Did gaze on him, childwise, Questioning in themselves what this might be, Clanking in panoply Of rust-red mail along the ferny maze Of the cool woodland ways. The rabbits scamper'd from his horse's feet, As o'er some wood-lawn, sweet With hyacinths, he pass'd, or down some glen, Purple with cyclamen; And now and then, as through the wood he went, On his strange hopes intent, There met him some tann'd woodman, stout and bluff, That with a word of gruff Early day-greeting did accost the squire. But else of his desire No foreign harshness broke the pleasant spell, Nor on his senses fell A human sight or sound; but all was sweet And silent, as is meet For him that dreams in the fair midmost Spring, Amid the birds that sing And the fresh flowers that gladden the old world With their pure eyes, impearl'd In many a whorl of virginal faint green. Slow wound the way between The columns of the trees; and now and then Some slope of shallowing glen Ceased suddenly upon an open space, Where many a fern did lace The greensward and the heather put forth buds And the red sad-eyed studs Of pimpernels did diaper the grass. Anon the squire did pass Betwixt lush hedge-rows, riding on again Along some country lane, Tangled with briers and the early rose And the white weed that blows With fragrant flower-flakes in the flush of May,— Whereon the shadows lay Of the new-leaféd trees, that over it A sun-fleck'd roof did knit To ward it from the heat. Now, as he went Adown some steep descent Or toil'd along some bridle-path, high hung Betwixt thin woods that clung Close to the brow of some tall cliff-spur's steep, His downward glance would sweep Across gold plains and cities thick with men And many a hollow glen, Sweet with the blossom'd vines in many a row, Toss'd seas of apple-snow And dropping gold of fire-flowers. Then again, As on the open plain The pair paced on and felt the sun once more, The fragrant breezes bore To him the distant hum of men and life, And the clear sounds were rife In the far distance of the village bells; And on the mossy fells, In the blue sky-marge, lay within his sight Some little town of white, With roofs rose-gilded by the flooding sun; For the noon had begun To hover over hills and charm the air Into the peace most fair And stirless of the midday. On the wold Slumber'd with wings of gold The hours, and all things rested. Not a breath Told of the late-left death Of the sad winter; but the world was glad, As if for aye it had The fair possession of the lovely May. And then again the way Wound down into the wood, and from the dells Gush'd up the perfumed swells Of breath from violets bedded in the moss, And many a hare would cross The sunn'd green pathway with a sunbeam's speed; And still the valiant steed Paced on, unslackening. So went horse and man, Until the sun began To draw toward the setting and the West Grew glorious on the crest Of the dumb hills. And now the day did fold Its mantle of deep gold And purple for its death upon the hills, And all the pomp, that fills The tragedy of sunset with the glow Of a king's death, did strow The radiant heaven. So down sank the sun, And so the day was done; And in the occident the silver horn Of the pale moon was borne Up in the gold-tinct watchet of the skies, And one by one, the eyes Of the unsleeping stars were visible In the clear purple bell Of that great blossom that we mortals name God's heaven, and there came The hush of sleep upon the lovely land. The Dream-god went and fann'd The air with flower-breathed breezes, and one knew, In the clear sweep of dew, The backward wind, that had been wandering o'er The pleasant fresh-flower'd shore, And now upon the breast of the dead day Came back to die away Into the stillness. Still the west was flush'd, Until the day-birds, hush'd By the prone night, gave place to those that hold The even with the gold Of their clear grieving song. The nightingale Began to tell the tale Of her great poet's sorrow, that is aye New-born and may not die, Being too lovely and too sad withal,— For sorrow may not fall Into the deeps of comfortable death, As may the Summer's breath And the fierce gladness of the July-tide,— And to his plighted bride The night-thrush piped, amid the plaited leaves, And every thing that grieves Melodiously for the dead day was fain To fill the air again With silver sadness. So the night fell down, And in her mantle brown All weary things addrest themselves to sleep, And over all, the deep Sweet silence brooded. Then the man was tired, And eke his steed required Some natural ministrance of rest and food. So in the middle wood The squire dismounted and with ears attent, Sought for some stream that went Between the trees; and speedily the plash Of ripples, that did dash And gurgle over pebbles, with a note Of welcome nearness smote Upon his hearing; and without delay He came where o'er the grey Of the moon-coloured mosses, trickled through The grass-roots and the rue A crystal rill, that to the wavering moon Sang up its changeless tune In the pale night. Thither the squire did bring His horse; then, by the spring Kneeling, drank deep and long, and looking round, Spied fallen on the ground Great store of berries from a neighbouring tree. So from the boughs did he Gather the fruit, and finding it was meet For human food, did eat A handful of sweet berries, red and brown,— And satisfied, lay down By his tired horse, that had already laid Himself beneath the shade Of a great elm, upon the cushion'd moss, Crushing the flowers across The twisted grass-stalks in the mossy sward, For many a fragrant yard, Beneath his weight; for all the earth was strewn So thick, beneath the moon, With all the Spring-tide heritage and dower Of lovely weed and flower, One might not tread there but the feet must crush Many a sweet flower-flush And broidery on the green earth's bridal gown. So fell the midnight down; And still Squire Ebhart, by his sleeping horse, Mused of the next day's course, And for the changeless thought of coming bliss, Forgot to woo the kiss Of the fair sleep that is all tired men's due. But, at the last, the dew Of slumber fell upon his heavy lids, And the fair God, that bids The dreamer to the far enchanted land, Laid on his brows a hand Of woven moonbeams; till the thoughts took flight Into the brooding night, And with a smiling face, the sleeper lay And dreamt of many a day Long lost behind the glimmering veils of time, And in a golden clime Went wandering through the dreamlands of his youth, Under the sweet skies' ruth, Link'd to his lady. So Squire Ebhart slept, What time the slow night swept Along the silver woodways and the hours Folded their wings on flowers, For peace of moonlight, till the moon 'gan fade For break of day, that laid Its cold grey hands upon the purple dusk And from the hodden husk Of the small hours drew forth the rosy bud Of morning, all a-flood With glittering dews: the golden dawn 'gan wake, With many a rosy flake And pearl of sungleams flung across the eaves; And through the screen of leaves, That overlay the place where Ebhart slept, The frolic sunlight crept, By help of some stray chinks within the woof Of the green luminous roof, And kissing all his face, as there supine He lay, in frolic vine And grass embow'red, warn'd him that day was come; And then the awakening hum Of the fresh wood and the bright tuneful clang Of quiring birds, that sang The reveillade of morning, with the gold Of the broad sun-glow, told His drowsy sense that it was morn again And he too long had lain In faineant slumber. Then did he arise And from his heavy eyes Brushing with drowsy hands the dust of sleep, Awhile watch'd the light creep Along the crests; then suddenly bethought Him of the thing he sought And how, if he would come to his desire, Before the sun rose higher, At once upon his forward way he must Be fain. And so he thrust His sleep from off him and with gladsome heart Addrest him to depart Upon his second day of journeying. So, stooping to the spring That well'd up through the thyme-roots clear and cool, He wash'd away the dull Gross heaviness of night that lay on him And standing on the brim Of the brown rippled pool, he call'd his steed, That in the neighbouring weed Did graze; and at his call the faithful beast Was fain to leave his feast And to his side came splashing through the fount, In haste. Then did he mount Into the saddle without more delay, And to find out the way He should travérse, a second he did pause Half doubtfully, because The man with sleep was somewhat dazed nor knew At first what path led due Toward the setting and the golden west; Then to the realms of rest, That lie beyond the day, his face he set, And spurr'd his horse. Not yet The dew was sun-dried from the pearlèd grass, As steed and man did pass Along the windings of the forest ways, Nor the faint scented haze, That hovers in the vanward of the morn, Over the flowers, had worn Its shimmering webs away, for the sun-glare, Into the thin blue air That waves unseen between the noontide rays;— For, seven long Spring days, From earliest morning to the couchant sun, Must Ebhart ride, nor shun The long day's labour,—turning not aside For aught that he espied Of fair or tempting,—if he would possess The yearn'd-for loveliness Of his high dreams. So seven long days he rode Along green pass and road, From morning-glitter to the even-gloam, Under the blue sky-dome, Following his dream through many changing lands; Now o'er the white sea-sands, With horsehoofs splashing through the foamy spray That broke across the way,— Now passing through the till'd fair fields of men, Hearkening to lark and wren And all the fowls whose kindly use it is Folk with the promised bliss Of their sweet song, to hearten at their toil,— Now riding where the soil Blew thick and sweet with roses red and white, And with the fair delight Of minstrelsy the scented air was weft; And whiles within the cleft Of many a bare rock and savage hill, Whose rifts rich gems did fill To overflowing and along whose veins The red gold blazed, like stains Of sunlight fix'd by some magician's skill. Through many a mountain rill, Swollen to torrents by the young year's rains, And over blossom'd plains Of heathy moorland, undefiled by feet Of toiling men and sweet With blowing breezes from the distant sea,— Through deeps of greenery And dim dumb churches of the giant pines, Ranged in sad stately lines, Waiting the coming of the Gods to be To hail with hymns,—rode he Unwearying alway; whilst the golden shoes Each day some part did lose Of their soft metal on the pointed stones; For all along the cones Of many a mountain range he toil'd, whereo'er No foot had pass'd before, Save that of goat or deer,—through many a reach Of grey and shingly beach And many a flinty pass; nor might aside Turn from the highway's wide Rough band of white, that wound out far away Into the dying day, To seek the tender greensward of the meads That lay beside him. Needs Must he endure the utmost of the toil, The bitterest of the coil Of struggles and of hardships, that abode Upon his wishward road. II.ATTAINMENT. AND now six days of journeying were done, And eke the seventh one Drew tow'rd the hour when, in the middle day, The golden lights do stay Their upward travel in the slant blue sky, And all the plains do lie Asleep beneath the sun. And with the flame Of noon, a change there came Upon the forward path; for until then The squire's advance had lain Through plains and woods and countries known to man: But now the road began, Upon the nooning of the seventh day, To merge into a way Strange beyond any that a man could know. Upon the earth below Strange glittering shells and sands of gray were strown, And many a blood-red stone, Changeful in colour; and above, gnarl'd trees Shook with an unfelt breeze; And therein many a shape of dwarf and gnome, Such as, folk say, do roam About the dreamland's gates, did climb and cling, Mowing and gibbering Like uncouth monstrous apes. On either hand, Gray flowerless plants did stand Along the highway's marge, and blood-red bells, Such as for midnight spells Thessalian witches pluck: and thereabout Crowded a noiseless rout Of gray and shadowy creatures. All the air Was misted with the glare Of the curst flowers and the strange baleful scent That from the herbs was sprent As for some ill enchantment: and the things That hover'd there had wings And waver'd dimly over Ebhart's head And beckon'd as they sped Across his path, striving to draw him off From the highway most rough And rude, among the pleasant fields that lay Each side the rugged way,— Tempting the man with many-colour'd flowers And semblants of lush bowers Of trellised foliage, set beside the path In many a waving swath Of corn and greensward, easeful to behold,— Wooing him in the gold Of the rich meadows to lie down and sleep Away, in that green deep Of flowers, the weariness of his long ride. But Ebhart not aside A hair's-breadth turn'd his steed for all their wiles, Nor for the golden smiles Of the fair harbours that invited him, Swerved from the highway's rim, Clear cut against the far horizon's blaze Of gold, his steadfast gaze; But with a firm-set mouth rode on thereby, Watching the sun now nigh To death upon the hills, as one that sees In thought his miseries Draw to their term, and for no thing nor power Will, in that fateful hour, Draw bridle nor be tempted from his road. So ever he abode In the due westward path, regarding not The glamours any jot, That compass'd him about. Then those strange things, That with their blandishings And spellwork strove to tempt him to forego His long intent, did know Their efforts void and with a doleful cry Evanish'd utterly Into the twilight and were no more seen. And as they fled, the treen Grew green again; the grey herbs wither'd off And all the sky did doff The lurid gloom and hazes that it wore. But Ebhardt, conning o'er The dim-gold landscape and the purple west For tokens of his quest, E'en as he rode, o'er in his memory turn'd The things for which he yearn'd,— That of the dreams which had possest his youth There might no whit, in sooth, Be lost for lack of his remembering: And so, as with swift wing His spirit wander'd in the olden ways, Searching amid the maze Of memories thick-woven in his mind,— The hurrying thoughts were twined Into the fulness of the old desire; And with the ancient fire There grew within the chambers of his brain, Unchanged by years and pain, The flower-new fantasies of days gone by. Now was the time to die Come for the day, wearied to utterest Of life, whenas the west Kiss'd its last kiss against the pale sun's lips; And now, as the eclipse Of the red light left void the weeping blue Of the pale heaven and through The woven cloisters of the purpled trees The evening-waken'd breeze Began to flutter, — upon either hand Over the weary land, Faint music sounded from the dim sweet woods, And the delight that broods Over fill'd sleep was sweet upon the squire: And all the man's desire As 'twere to brim with ecstasy, he heard The carol of a bird, That sang as it awhile had dwelt among The high seraphic throng And listen'd to the smitten golden lyres Pulsing among the choirs Of Paradise, beside the crystal sea, — And such an ecstasy Of echoes linger'd at its heartstrings still, It never could fulfil Its bliss with memory of those wondrous hours, But to the earthly flowers Some snatches of the singing's rise and fall Strove ever to recall. Then in the middle road there rose before The squire a mist, that wore Strange blazonry of many mingling hues, As 'twere the falling dews Were curtain'd in a thick and glittering haze Across the forward ways; And in the clear sweet hour before the night There rose in the twilight An arch of glitterance upon the hem Of heaven, like a gem Built to a rainbow, that 'twixt earth and sky Grew higher and more high; And as it grew, the colours that it wore Shone glorious ever more, As if it were the portal of the land Of Faerie. Nigh at hand The place beyond that archway of a dream Unto the squire did seem, And with great joyance through the bended bow, That all the earth did strow With blending lights of amethyst and gold, He rode, thinking to hold His dream at once; but, as he pass'd the verge, The mountains seem'd to surge In the blue distance like a billowy sea, And the far sky did flee Along the arch. The golden heaven's rim Grew paler and more dim, Receding alway, and the place whereon He rode was clad upon With a bright sudden growth of magic blooms. Out of the folding glooms Of the near dusk rose trail on trail of flowers And arch'd the road with bowers Of an unearthly sweetness, marking out His way, beyond a doubt, Unto his quest: and as he rode along The vaulted path, the song Of the strange bird more rapturous ever grew, Like an enchanted dew Of music falling in a silver sea. All over flower and lea A new light pass'd, that was not of the sun, For all the day was done And the dim night held all the lands aswoon, Until the hornèd moon Should ride pearl-shod across the purple wold. Then from the rim of gold That linger'd still on the horizon's marge, A golden blaze grew large Of glamorous colour and within the span Of the broad arch began To spread and hold the purple of the skies; And as with all his eyes Gazed Ebhart, wonder-dumb, — against the ground Of purest gold that crown'd The heavens in the ending of the glade, There were for him inlaid Turrets and battlements, a flowering Of every lovely thing. Along the marge of the sweet sky there rose Gold towers and porticoes Of burnish'd jasper, ruby cupolas And domes high-hung, topaz And opal-vaulted; sapphire campanelles Held up their flower-blue bells Against the gold sky; silver fountain-jets Between the minarets Threw high their diamond spray, and fretted spires Flamed up, like frozen fires Of amethyst and beryl, past the height Of lofty walls of white, Thickset with terraces aflame with flower. Shower upon scented shower, The blossoms rain'd from high and bloomy trees, Before a scented breeze, That fill'd the air with balms and orient gold And on its waftings roll'd Across the plains a singing sound of lyres, Smitten from golden wires, And clarion-notes, wide-spreading like a sea Under a company Of joinèd voices, murmuring softest words To music like white birds Winnowing the foam of some gold Indian bay. Lay murmur'd unto lay From out that dwelling of a God's delight, Following each other's flight To greet the dreamer with their blissful stress, And pipes and lutes no less Yearn'd up to him with strains of welcoming. And Ebhart, lingering As 'twere before his nigh-fulfill'd desire, Knew all those towers of fire, Sun-glancing, and the flower-fleck'd terraces, And in the harmonies, Wide-winging through the crystal air agleam With gold-flakes, knew his dream, As of old times he had pourtray'd the place, With all its changeful grace No moment same, for all the golden dew And all the flowers that blew And shimmer'd like a noon-mist thereabout. So with a glad heart, out Through the flower-arch he rode and came unto The portal, sculptured through With pictures of a dream in chrysoprase And beryl and a maze Of blossoms of the jewel that in one Is flower and precious stone, Being clear hyacinth, — wroughten by no hand Of man. The leaves did stand Wide-open for his coming, backward roll'd Even to their flange of gold. So in he rode and saw the white town spread, In all its goodlihead Like nothing earthly, very still and wide, Upon his either side Far-stretching like a vision of the night Beyond his further sight. The place was overrun with flowerage Of wondrous blooms that wage War with the sun in many an Orient clime: Great silver bells did climb The gabled turrets with their linking chains, Mix'd thick with crimson skeins And chalices of sapphire. In the ways Gold-paven, rose a maze Of trellised porticoes and white dream-steads; And midst the mossy beds Of the lush flowers, strewn like a rain of stars In every court, through bars Of gold one saw clear lakelets lay and toy'd With the white swans, that joy'd To sport in their cool pleasance; and the air Was tuneful with the fair Clear tinkle of the crystal rills that ran Across each flowerbed's span And fed the grass-roots. Then, as down the street Rang out the horse's feet, Calling strange lovely echoes from their cells, Flute-notes and silver bells, That broke the silence with a songful spray, There ran in the mid way Unto the man a sudden cloud of girls, With breasts like double pearls Rose-tinted by long sojourn in the gold Of some far Orient, stoled But in the waving mantles of their hair: Tall maidens, dusk and fair With the long gilding kisses of the light, Fresh from the fierce delight Of plains of golden Ind and Javan seas, Shook on the fragrant breeze Rich scents from lotus-cups; and Grecian maids, Under their night-black braids, Cinct with the green acanthus, did advance, Link'd in a rhythmic dance: Fair girls came, crown'd with white narcissus-stars, From rose-strewn plains of Fars; The lithe mild maids of gold Pacific isles Brought him their pearly smiles And olive brows set clear with eyes of black: Nor to his sight did lack Women with faces of the rosy snow Only the west can show, In whose fair ivory for double light Two tender eyes and bright Were set, the colour of the spring-sky's blue, Hazed with the early dew,— And down their shoulders fell a fleece of gold, In many a ripple roll'd Of sun-imprisoning locks. And these beside, From every portal's wide Gaped folds came out into the golden street, Eager the man to greet, Bright shapes of every radiant eye-delight Of lovely women dight In pleasant raiment, that a dream can heap Up in the aisles of sleep. Then those fair creatures,—waving like a sea Of gold and ebony, For all the mazes of their floating hair,— Smote the clear jewell'd air With songs of triumph and of welcoming; And while their lips did sing, Their hands strew'd jasmines in the horse's path And with a scented swath Of violet and rose and orange-stars, Hid every sign of wars And toil that cumberèd the valiant steed. Now in the song indeed And in the varied beauty of the girls, Set clear in clustering curls, Were easance and delight for any man That since the world began Loved girls and song and the soft cadenced beat Of golden-sandall'd feet On thick-strewn flowers; and there might well the fire Of any man's desire Be quell'd and satisfied with loveliness And all its dreams possess In those fair women, with their flowery kiss And their descant's clear bliss. But Ebhart cherish'd in his heart—made clear By many a weary year Of void desire—the memory of a face Of an unearthly grace And glory, that had smïled on him in dreams, Woven, it seem'd, of gleams Of pure spring suns and flowers of white moonlight,— And for the memory, might Have pleasance in no woman save in this, That was his Beatrice And queen of love. So all unmoved he went By any blandishment Of that fair throng, slowly adown the street, Hoping his eyes should meet Her eyes for whom alone his heartstrings shook. Then, seeing that the look Of yearning died not from the seeker's eyes, Circling in bright bird-wise, The fair crowd broke before his onward route; And from the rest came out A maiden, robed in falling folds of green And crown'd with jessamine And myrtle-snows, that took his bridle-rein And led the steed, full fain, Along the fragrant carpet of the way, Toward a light that lay Far in the westward distance like a flame Of gold. Behind them came The frolic crowd of girls, following the twain With showers of blossom-rain And rills of song, until they brought them where Pillars of pearl upbare A dome of lustrous sapphire, flank'd with spires That pierced the sky like fires Up-flaming from the molten furnaces Of middle earth, 'mid trees Ablaze with flowers of gold. Before the gate The maiden did abate Her onward way and bade the squire alight. Then on the pavement, white With scented snows, the man sprang lightly down And with his gauntlet brown Smote on the golden trellis such a stroke, That all the echoes woke Thereto: and therewithal the gold leaves split In twain and did admit The sight through archways into many a glade Of gardens, all outlaid Beneath the heavens' kisses. Entering Therein, the maid did bring The squire, through many dwellings of delight, Into a place where light Lay full and soft a velvet sward athwart. There in the middle court Circled with jewell'd cloisters all around,— Upon the emerald ground Of gilded mosses broider'd with all flowers In stories of the hours That through the spring and summer bear the year Over the flower-beds clear,— There was a throne of gold and coral set, With many a goodly fret Of ivory work, upon the suppliant heads Of strange fair quadrupeds, Most like a lovely lion with girl's eyes, Upborne; and warder-wise About the throne, stood maidens white as milk, Vestured in snowy silk Banded with cramozin, and pages fair, Clad all in pleasant vair And silver, that so thick and numberless About the throne did press, One might not see the visage of the Crown'd That sat thereon. Around, Among the roses and the tulip-beds, Thick-vein'd with silver threads Of tiny trickling rills, fair birds of white And red did stalk and bright Peacocks and doves of every lovely hue, Golden and green and blue, Trail'd jewell'd plumes along the garden-ways, That with the goodly blaze Of their full splendour so did fill the bowers, It seem'd all fairest flowers Had put on wing and motion, to fulfil Their beauty at the will Of some enchantress of the olden days. About the glancing ways Of that bright garden ceaselessly they went, Weaving its ravishment Into fresh webs of colour and delight. And as their pageant bright Eddied and wound among the garden-grots, From all their fluted throats There was a vaporous choral song exhaled, As 'twere the spirit fail'd Within them, for delight, to shape its bliss Into the words that kiss The ear with perfect music, and was fain For very rapturous pain Of ecstasy to lapse into a song. Now on the glittering throng Long time the squire had gazed, held in a trance Of joy, nor dared advance His spell-bound feet; and oft for bliss he sigh'd. But that fair maid, his guide, Laid hands on him and brought him, through the crowd Of maidens snowy-brow'd, To the mid-garden, where the throne was set. Then did the man forget All things that blazon'd earthly life for him, And all his dream grew dim Before a new-born wonder: for, as there He stood, he was aware Of a fair shape that sat upon the throne, Such as to him was shown In dreams the image of his Queen of Love. Clear was her brow above The crystals of the snow for purity, And round its ivory Seven silver stars there were for diadem Upon the waving hem Of the rich tresses set, that rippled down, A flood of golden-brown, The colour of the early chestnut's robe, When yet the summer's globe Is but half rounded out with flower and sun. And from the stars did run Commingling rays of many-colour'd light, That with a strange delight Fill'd all the trancèd network of her hair, Wherein for all men's care Were set soft anodynes and balms of sleep. Within her lips, a deep Of coral garner'd up its pearls a-row, And in her arching brow There were two eyes unfathomable set, Wherein might one forget The glance of the dead friend of bygone years And the sweet smile through tears Of the lost love of youth; for they were clear And soft as a hill-mere After spring-rains, whenas the early dew Has fallen in its blue, And yet with some strange hints of deeper tones, Such as the June night owns, Before the moon is full, when the clear stars Ride on their jewell'd cars, Queenless, across the purple of the skies And the day-murmur dies Under the vaulted dome of amethyst. With such lips Dian kiss'd Endymion sleeping on the Latmian sward: From such twin eyes were pour'd The philtres of the summer night upon The evil-fortuned son Of Priam, smitten with a fearful bliss. Whoever had the kiss Of her red lips kiss'd never woman more, Having attain'd the shore Of that supernal bliss the ancients sought So long, but never wrought To find,—the very perfectness of love. Upon one hand, a dove, Pearl-white and with a golden colleret, Was for a symbol set, And in the other one lys-blooms she held, Gold-cored and snowy-bell'd, The sceptre of her queendom. 'Twixt the snows Of her fair breast, a rose, Mix'd red and white, lay droop'd with heavy head, As with the mightihead Of love that fill'd her presence all forspent. And as on him was bent That full sweet visage, its sheer perfectness Of glory did possess The squire with such a wondering delight Of bliss and such a might Of hurrying thoughts, that for the very fire Of his fulfill'd desire The life well-nigh forsook him; and eftsoon He would have fallen aswoon Before that Lady of all loveliness, That from the ardent stress And furnace of his dream to shape had grown. But she, to whom were known The passions that within his soul did meet, Descending from her seat, Bent down and in her ivory arms embraced His neck and all enlaced His failing visage with her woven hair, Holding him captive there Within a gold and silver prison house. Then, parting from the brows His ruffled hair, she kiss'd him on the mouth; And suddenly the drouth Of yearning, that so many years had tried His spirit, did subside And was all quench'd within a honied deep Of kisses, that did steep His soul in ravishment ineffable And restful. So there fell A woof of sleep upon his every limb; And in the trances dim Of twining dreams, he heard a silver song From out that glittering throng Of lovely girls and jewel-plumaged birds Fill all the air with words, That (if with devious weary earthly speech One might avail to reach Some echo of their sweetness) in this wise Somewhat did fall and rise, Like sea-waves beating on a golden bar Of sands, but lovelier far. Song. Low laid in thyme And nodding asphodels, Dream on and feel flower-fragrance kiss Thy forehead free from all the dints of time: Thou shalt awake to greater bliss, Bounden with linkèd spells Of love and rhyme. Fear not, pale friend, Thy dream shall pass away: Thou hast attain'd the shores of rest, Where the wave-break against the grey beach-bend Brings up sad singings from the West No more. Here Love is aye Sweet without end. For here the grief And sadness left behind With weary life are turn'd to gold Of dreams: from stern old mem'ries, sheaf on sheaf, The buds of strange delights unfold Their sweets, like flowers we find Under a leaf. Here in this deep Of grass-swaths, piled with flowers, All things most fair and loveliest, Too pure for earth and all her toil to reap, Do lie and crush the fruits of rest, And all the golden hours Lie down to sleep. Here Love doth sit, No longer sad and cold, As in the weary life of men The hard stern need of toil has fashion'd it; But pure and silver-clear again And withal red as gold For crownals fit. Here hope is not, Nor fear: for all the ease One wearied for in wordly strife Were but as nought beside one pearly grot Of this fair place, and all a life Of fears herein would cease And be forgot. Hath any dole? Bird-songs are comforting, And all the flower-scents breathe of balm: Dream on and soothe the sadness from thy soul; For here life glitters like a calm Of summer seas that sing A barcarolle. Count life with flowers! This is our dial here. A kiss and violets twined around The brow, soft sleep in honeysuckle bowers, Lilies and love with roses crown'd, Jasmine and eglatere, Cadence our hours. Dream within dream; Dreaming asleep, awake; There is no sweeter thing than this, To lie beneath flower-snows and fountain-gleam, Save if with touch of lips and kiss One win the sleep to break, Yet hold the dream. III.FALLING AWAY. So the song hover'd over Ebhart's sleep, By many a silver sweep And many a golden sigh of horns and flutes And broidery of lutes Within the failing cadences sustain'd: And, as he slept, the stain'd Worn harness and accoutrements from him Were borne, and every limb Was purified from all the dust of toil And all that journey's soil, In essences of all the balms that be In Ind or Araby For purging all life's weary stains and sad. Then on the man was clad Fair raiment, thrice in Tyrian purples dyed, Gold-fringed and beautified With broidery of pearl-work silver-laced; And on his breast they placed A golden owch, rare-wrought and coral-chain'd. And as the singing waned, The magic slumber slid away from him; And therewithal the dim Sad doubts and weariness of earth forwent His soul and there was lent To every limb a perfectness of ease, As in the golden seas Of some charmed ocean he had bathed and cast His age off. So he past With that fair queen athwart the dreamy land, Wandering, hand in hand, Through many courts and jewel-vaulted halls, Wherein the trellis'd walls Show'd through the sunflecks,—carved and limnèd o'er With all the lovely lore Of Faërie and all the glitterance Of Orient romance; And in one chamber,—thick with jasmine stars Woven betwixt the bars Of gold that latticed all the sides from floor To roof-tree, vaulted o'er With one clear bell of sapphire silver-ray'd,— Them side by side they laid On beds of sandal wood and cramozin; Then did fair maids bring in A banquet, set and sweet in golden shells, Mingled with great flower-bells And cups of jasper and corneliand. There peacocks did expand Their jewell'd fans, fresh from the fairy looms; Herons with argent plumes, Untorn by falcon, lay on silver beds; And opal-blazon'd heads Of dove and culver glitter'd out through green Of bedding moss. Between Gold lilies lay the silver-feather'd swan, Reclined in death upon Lush leaves of vine and flowers of oranges; And every bird that is For pleasant food ordain'd, in vine leaves wet With crystal dew, was set Before the twain, each in its several room. And from the jewell'd gloom Of ocean-deeps there came its lovely things, Gold fish with silver wings, Great diamond-sided carp with opal eyes, Dolphin that ever dies A rainbow glory and an eye-delight; Sword-fish, and shell-fish bright With ruby armour, mullets gold and grey, And all the rest that play Among the hyacinthine cool sea-deeps— Where many a coral creeps 'Mid pearls and weeds of every lovely hue— Until themselves endue The radiance of the pearl and coral things And the clear colourings Of feather'd sea-flowers thick about their life: These all and more were rife, Outlaid—for food of men to godship grown— In many a precious stone Wroughten with silver to the mimic cup Of that fair flower that up From the still lake holdeth its argent star, That men call nenuphar. There did the beehives yield their amber dew, Glittering pale golden through The frail white fretwork of the honeycomb; And in their velvet bloom Shone gold and purple fruits of the year's prime, That in the Autumn-time Of some far wondrous land had hung and glow'd, What while the winter rode On his pale horse across the stricken earth; And the clear soul of mirth And love was there in chalices of wine, Such as no earthly vine Has ever dreamt of in its dreams of June; And all the place was strewn With jewels full of juices wonder-sweet, That seem'd for kings more meet To wear upon their brows, than to suffice, Even in Paradise, Unto men's hunger. Over all there fell A shower of asphodel And almond-blossoms, and the air did rain With roses. So the twain Lay at the banquet upon lavish flowers, Whilst through the gradual hours Bright sights and sounds did charm the time's advance For them. One while, a dance Of wood-nymphs glitter'd circlewise across The windflower-sprinkled moss, That paved the halls; or from the fountain's deep Of silver sands would sweep A flight of green-hair'd naiads, dripping gold And pearls from every fold Of their wet hair and weed-ytangled dress; And then, perchance, the stress Of silver clarions and the sweet sad thrill Of the struck harps would fill The air, preluding to a cavalcade Of lovely shapes array'd In cramozin and azure, —dames and knights And all the eye-delights Of the old pageantries of queens and kings; And to the cadenced strings And reeds swell'd up the clash of shields and spears And the fair tranceful fears Of the bright battle and the hot tourney: The clang of the sword-play Rang out from targe and morion, and the ring Of lance-points shivering. The banners and the tabards ebb'd and flow'd, The jewell'd crownals glow'd In tireless changeful splendour; and the haze Of the far-column'd ways Glittered with glancing mail and blazonries Of all bright hues one sees In the fair pictures of the olden time. And oft with many a rhyme The minstrels fill'd the pauses, in quaint lays And songs of bygone days Hymning the praise of many a champion Of time past. So slid on The dream along the halls of phantasy, Folding him blissfully Within a rapturous calm; but, more than this, That crownèd lady's kiss, The woven magic of her tresses' gleam And her soft eye's sunbeam, Fetter'd the dreamer in a silken trance Of masterful romance. Now, as the meal was done with many a song And luting from the throng Of pearl-limb'd girls, —the curtains of the dark About the golden ark Of the day-heaven were drawn; and the clear night Came with its own delight Of lambent stars and heavy night-flowers' scent, — Whenas the firmament Hangs o'er the earth like some great orange-grove Wherethrough the fire-flies rove In some far land of Orient, —to enspell The senses; and the bell Of the slant sky grew hung with fretted lights. For never fail the night's Enchantments in the land of dreams (as say Some makers) nor the day With its sheer splendours satisfies the sense; But the easeful suspense Of the stilled midnight is as welcome there As morning, being fair And full of lovely spells of peace and rest, Graven on the palimpsest Of day with star-runes; nor without the night Could one have love's delight In perfect fulness. So the night was spread Above the golden bed Of those two lovers, whilst the harefoot hours Fled through the rosy bowers Of that fair dream-stead, on the moonlight's wings; And all the lovely things, That fill the interspace betwixt sundown And the new-risen crown Of morning throned upon the Orient crests, Hover'd about the breasts Of that fair lady, as she lay asleep, Folded in peace as deep As the blue heaven with the gold stars fleck'd. And when the morning check'd His coursers for the sweep into the sky And from the bravery Of newborn day the glamours of the night Folded their wings for flight Where through the dusk the sun had made a gap, Those lovers from the lap Of their sweet slumbers rose and hand in hand, Look'd over the fair land And saw the eternal spring grow young again Over each hill and plain Of that enchanted paradise of sweets: And the delight, that beats To amorous tunes within the spring-flower blood, Swelled up to overflood Their quick'ning spirits with a radiant mist Of philtres; and they kiss'd Again with double rapture. In mid-green, Under tall stately treen, In noble woods they wander'd, where the birds Hail'd them with golden words, Clearer and lovelier than earthly song; And all the pure-eyed throng Of wood-flowers held sweet converse for their ease. The blue anemones Murmur'd quaint tender fairy-tales of spring And of the blossoming Of elfin souls in every pale sweet bud; The fragile bells that stud The moss with cups of sapphire, when the year Brings round the Midsummer, Sang mystic songs for them of summer nights And all their deep delights Of throbbing stars and singing nightingales; And heather-bells told tales Of elfins dancing on the thymy sward, What while the white moon pour'd Full hands of pearl upon the breezy moors. And as along the floors Of spangled moss they went, beneath the woofs Of leaves, the tiny hoofs Of deer smote softly on the woodland lawns, And the lithe brown-eyed fawns Laid velvet muzzles on their toying hands. Now along golden sands By sapphire deeps they walk'd, thick strewn with shells Of each bright kind that dwells In seas, and watch'd the gold fish dart and flash Across the cool wave-plash And the curl'd foam slide up and fall away Into a silver spray, As the great plangent waves broke, green and white, In sheets of malachite. Then would the queen take Ebhart by the hand And from some jut of sand Down diving through the gold and emerald waves, Visit the coral caves Of the sea-nymphs and all the palaces Of crystal, under seas Built for the Nereïds' pleasance, —wandering Along the deeps that ring With mermaids' song, and plucking living flowers That in the mid-sea bowers Wave for the mermen, gold and blue and white. Or with a calm delight The twain lay floating on the silver foam, Watching the azure dome Of heaven wide-ceil'd above the emerald leas, And the light fragrant breeze Wafting the silver cloud-plumes o'er the blue. Haply, some bird that flew, Wide-winging, tow'rd the golden-stranded East, Sometime its travel ceased At her command, and in her ivory breast Nestling, awhile would rest And murmur stories of the wondrous things Each day of wing-work brings To one that pulses tow'rd the rising sun. And when the morn was done, Mayhap, returning to the land, the queen Within some heart of green Would sit and hold the man within her arms, Weaving with many charms, For him to living shape and lovely sooth, The memories of youth And the quaint fancies of his wildest dreams, Re-clad with golden beams Of mystic splendour, ever fresh and new; So that but now he knew How very full his every thought had been Of all the lovely sheen And glamour of the land of phantasy. Over the dappled lea And the slant hillside, blossom-starr'd, would rise Before his ravish'd eyes Fair crystal castles and enchanted bowers, Trellised with magic flowers, That in their every calyx held a face Of an unearthly grace. Horn-notes came faint and far upon the breeze; Between the moss-clad trees Fair ladies pass'd, with greyhounds falcon-eyed And pages at their side; And knights rode forth a-questing. O'er the sward Pageant on pageant pour'd Of the quaint elves that hold the ancient woods And the gnarl'd race that broods Deep in the jewell'd chambers of the rock: Or with her milk-white flock Some dreamy shepherdess went sauntering by, With flowerful hands and eye Fix'd on the petals of some rose of gold. And now the lilies told The twain that day drew fast toward the dark. Then did they both embark In some fair shallop's pearl and ivory side, And down the glancing tide Of some full river, over-hung with trees, Glided before the breeze That fill'd the silken sails; 'twixt terraced walls, Past rows of ancient halls And towers far-glancing 'gainst the golden sky; Where all the courts did lie Ungated, and the dying sun sloped slow Along the evening glow Through range on range of golden palaces, Glittering on lattices Of blue and silver, tenantless and still. A strange sad peace did fill The lonely streets; and through the voiceless air, Perchance, some breeze would bear The silver sound of bells, whose music spread In circles overhead, Widening far out upon a stirless sea Of silentness. Maybe, Bytimes, the man would deem himself alone In some fair meadow, strown With bright-eyed flowers, or on some river's bank, Where rank on plumèd rank Sedges blew purple; when, as he did deem, That sovereign of his dream Had for a little faded from his side: And at the first he sigh'd To find her place left empty suddenly; But soon he knew that she Was ever with him, if invisible. Whether some cowslip's bell He idly broke or pull'd a violet up, Straightway from out the cup A sweet face look'd; two tender dewy eyes Gazed deep in his, and sighs Of ravishing sweet music fill'd his ears, Until his soul with tears Of joy brimm'd over: then two lips would seek His own, as 'twere to speak All things' love to him in a fragrant kiss; And ravish'd with the bliss, He would press closelier on the flower and find It was his lady twined Soft arms about him and laid lips to his With such a flower-bell kiss, Being both flower and bird and breeze and queen. Or, —look'd he in the green Of some fair crystal pool all fringed with sheaves Of the nesh flower that weaves Soft green and rosy-white of blooms around Each lake that in the swound Of the mid-June lies stirless, —there would grow From out the deeps a snow Of starry lily-petals, that, between Their golden-gaufred green Unfolding, show'd to him a tender face, Crown'd with a dripping grace Of gold-brown hair, that through the waves rose high, Upon his lips to sigh The soul of amorous longing. Being seen Full, it was still the queen, That in no wise could let man's love grow cold, Being so manifold And rich of heart, that as each flower she knew To love, or as the dew Wooeth the moonbeam's kisses: she could take All shapes of love that wake Under the skies: whether the nightingale Telleth her amorous tale Unto the argent-blossom'd thorn, the winds About the pale woodbinds Flutter with loveful longing, or the bees Around the anemones Fly with a bridal murmur; she could win Her eyes to looks akin And prison all their passion in her lays; And in all other ways Wherein on earth is love made manifest— So that each loveliest And peerless for the hour of love should seem— That lady of a dream Could twine the souls of mortals with delight. Nor with the deathless light Of love alone was Ebhart's being blest: Around his footsteps press'd An ever-changing sea of lovely things; The radiant flowerings Of all the poet-hopes a dreamer knows, While yet the dewy rose Of his fresh youth is wormless for the years; The wraiths of the waste tears And the pure phantoms of the dear dead past Came back to him at last In a new guise of shapes emparadised: For nothing it sufficed Unto the perfecting of his desire Of old, that for the squire The happy shapes alone of his strange dreams— Woven all of sunbeams And griefless flowers—should be fulfill'd for him: He must possess the dim Ethereal sadnesses that were so sweet, Before the stern years' feet Crush'd all the glory from the soul of pain; And in his sight again Must the impalpable essence new abide, Sublimed and glorified By the transfiguring splendour of his dream: The much-loved dead must seem To walk with him the blossom-trellis'd ways, And the remember'd gaze Of the dead friends he loved in days gone by Meet him in every eye Of flower-cups blinking on the mossy leas; And in each fragrant breeze Belovéd voices murmur him again Old songs of love and pain And hope undying. So the man did move In one long dream of love, And all his life was one great fairy-tale, Wherein no thing did fail Of the bright visions he had wont to see In his fresh youth. —Ah me! That joy should be so strong and pitiless And mortal men no less Inapt to brook its agony of sweets! That the delight which beats In the full veins should be the enemy Of this frail flesh! That we Should ever prove so uncreate to bear The things that are most fair In our idea, —should faint and die before The dream of bliss is o'er! Alas! we can bear sorrow and the stress Of earth's dull weariness, Day after day eating our bitter bread, Silent, with tears unshed And life still pulsing dumbly; but the kiss Of the full rapturous bliss We dream of withers us with its delight; And back into the night Of our despair needs must we faint and fall, Finding dull custom's thrall And the dumb pain of daily life less keen And deadly than the sheen Of the bright bliss to us unbearable! So it to Ebhart fell That he must be divorced from the delight That with such godlike might Of will he had prevail'd to win, — being strong To dare and to prolong His days in strife, cheer'd by some distant hope Dim-radiant in the scope Of the dull daily sky, — but not enough Strong for the splendid love Of that enchantress and the unearthly bliss That in that oasis Of dreams was his. Old was the man and weak, And wearily the wreak Of the hard years had worn the youth from him, Deadening in heart and limb The soul of fire that erst burnt fresh and high. So, when the ecstasy, Awhile by that infection of his quest Kindled within his breast Out of the embers of the ancient fire, Grew cold, the feeble sire In the full tide of bliss was like to drown. The stressful glories strown About his life did burn and weary him Beyond his strength; his dim And age-worn sense fail'd with the ecstasy; And thus it came to be That, in the gold and purple of the land,— Midmost the arms that spann'd Him round, the lips that on his lips still lay And the deep orbs that aye Flooded his spirit with their tireless light,— Through all the dear delight And glory of that life of flowers and dew, Within the man there grew A longing, half-unconsciously, to wear Once more the weight of care That deadens all the lives of mortal men, A wish to feel again The dull repose of the eventless days, And from the stressful blaze Of that too radiant dream once more to fade Back to the level shade Of thoughtless men's dull daily round of life, Wherein there was no strife Of earthly parts and forces to suffice To joys of Paradise Whose fire none scatheless save a god might know. So day by day did grow The longing, 'spite his wish, within his thought; Albeit hard he fought To conquer it, in all his looks it show'd; And all that bright abode Was grown to him like some fair hurtful fire Of o'er-fulfill'd desire, That eats the heart to madness. And one day,— As on the breast he lay Of that fair dame and in the radiant deep Of her strange eyes did steep His soul in burning languor,—it befell That the unquellable Desire burst up, no more to be represt, Out of his weary breast With a great bitter cry; and he was fain To tell her of his pain And of the mortal weakness, that in him Stretch'd out—toward the rim Of the sad world and the dull life-long bands— Weary and weakling hands Of backward longing, being all too frail And world-worn to avail For the hot passionate splendour of the things Of his imaginings. “The dreams of youth come back to me too late, Sweetheart,” he said. “The gate Of kindly death gapes wide for me; and I Would fain go back to die Among the towns and cities of my folk, Under the wonted yoke Of mortal custom; for I am but man, Nor for all longing can Shake off the leaden hand of age and use. And now my limbs refuse To bear the bliss of dreamland any more, And all my soul is sore With the long struggle. I had all forgot— Whilst yet the flame was hot Of the new-found delight—that I was old, And that the creeping cold Of death came very nigh upon my feet: But now I feel it, sweet, And may not tarry with thee any more, That, with slow steps—before The pale Archangel touch me—I again May for awhile regain The tents of men and die among my kin, Repenting of my sin And grasp for things beyond the reach or ken Of miserable men. Wherefore, I pray thee, kiss me yet once more— For all my heart is sore For parting from thee—and unspell my feet; So haply I may greet The dwellings of my kind before I die.” So he with many a sigh Spake to the queen and told her all his mind. And she,—that had divined And known his yearning many a day and long, Yet ever did prolong The time of parting with the man,—with slow Sad loving speech said, “Go: I may not bid thee stay with me, poor friend, That to the common end Of weary men draw'st nigh, and (being man) Labourest beneath the ban Of the all-conquering pain and may'st not bear The bliss thyself didst rear In thy high fancy. Go: I love thee still,— Better, perchance,—and fill Thy destiny; for Fate is over all, And one may not recall The ordinance of God that fashion'd us, Albeit despiteous And very sad it seem.” And kiss'd him thrice Upon the brow, in guise Of parting. Then the shape of her 'gan fade Into the purple shade, And all that dreamland melted into air. And Ebhart,—standing there Upon a desolate sweep of heathy plain, Whereo'er the night did wane And the June day came from the golden sills Of heaven on the hills,— Saw all the towers of gold and jasper fall And knew beyond recall His dream-built world with all its lovely might Faded into the night; And the hot tears brimm'd up his weary eyes. Then close to him did rise The carol of a lark; and it befell That with the song the spell Of grief was lighten'd, and some sadden'd peace Came back to give him ease, Upon that sunward hymning of the bird. And looking round, he heard A joyous neighing, and his true old steed Came to him in his need And rubb'd its head against his hand. So he Mounted and o'er the lea Rode, as the sun across the hills grew fair,— And in the innocent air, The flower-scents told of the fair midmost June, And the sweet early tune Of the waked birds sang of the faded Spring And the new flowering Of the fresh fields with all the Summer weaves Of bloom,—and in the sheaves Of yellowing corn, the sunlight lay like gold Of consolation, told By the dear God unto the earth rain-worn And weary and betorn With snow and tempest. So the old squire rode Upon the homeward road, Among the fields, where all the world was glad And none that he was sad Had time to note,—and with the dying day Came to a town, that lay Childwise within the bosom of the hills, And in the peace that fills The hour of sunset, slept beneath the sky, In one great panoply Of crimson glory. And indeed it seem'd Most like the thing he dream'd Of the celestial city, where alone This flesh shall have outgrown The feebleness of life. And so he came Into the town, all lame And worn with travel and his hopes down cast; And there he found at last A little weary rest among strange men, And was at peace again. And there a resting-space he did abide; And in the Autumn-tide A little while thereafterward he died. SALVESTRA Girolamo ama la Salvestra: va, costretto da' prieghi della madre, a Parigi: torna e truovala maritata: entrale di nascosto in casa e muorle allato: e portato in una chiesa, muore la Salvestra allato a lui. Boccaccio: Il Decamerone, Giorn. iv. 8. AH, Love, thou art but as a Summer's guest, That long before the Winter fleest away And in some warmer haven harbourest, Nipt by the hard swift life of our To-day! Our love is scant and flowerless as our May And will not lightly let its pinions soil Their rainbow plumes in our unblissful toil. Time was, fair God, when thou heldst fuller sway And all folk were thy thralls in gentilesse: Time was when men were simpler than to-day And life was not one fierce and loveless stress Of unrelenting labour in the press Of joyless souls, when men had leave to rest And toy with grace and beauty, unreprest. Full sweet, ah! hopeless sweet, to us it seems — Fast bounden in a mesh of strife and care — That time of graceful ease and builded dreams, Seen in a glamour through the misted air; Through which sweet strains of song the breezes bear And scents of flowers that then were full and blythe But now are mown away by Time's swift scythe. And yet it was no golden age, that time; Not unalloyed with pain and doubt and strife: But through all ventures ran the gold of rhyme And Love was high and was the Lord of Life. From Venice-turrets unto Algarsife, All held fair deeds and lovely worshipful And all were scholars in Love's gracious school. Then men did honour Love with heart and soul, Setting their lives upon his smile or frown; For in their hearts his altar-flame was whole And burnt unchanged until Life's sun went down. Love was the flower of life and honour's crown, Wherewith men perfumed all the weary years And purged the air from mean and sordid fears. Then men, as they for very Love could live, So for the death of very Love could die, Holding it shame to let the rank flesh give Commandment to the swift soul's fantasy; And for the love of him they held so high, Did woo and win, with fair and potent faith, The cold embraces of his brother Death. A sad sweet tale is hovering in my thought, A tale of perfect love in death fulfilled, From out the waves of sweeping Time upwrought By that enchanter of the past, who filled The ears of men with music sweet and wild, When in the world he breathed strange scents upon That sheaf of flowers men call Decameron. A tale in dreams, heard betwixt wake and sleep, Under the tremulous shadow of the planes; Attuned to rhythmic cadence by the sweep Of murmurous rillets through the scented lanes Of rose and jasmine, sweep of wings and strains Of happy linnets piping to the rose And chirp of crickets in the olive-close. O Master, of whose speech in that green time, Heard under shredded laurels and faint flowers, I took the echo for my painful rhyme, To warm it in this cold hard time of ours, Whose plagues no wall of rose or lys outbowers — Let not thy laureat brow be rough with frown, If I unleave thy honeysuckle crown With my interpreting. Sweet is the will, And all fair-meaning as a day in June, The faded áccords of thy song to fill And echo back that magical sweet tune Thou sangest in the garden's golden noon, With youths and maidens lying, myrtle-crowned, Upon the flower-glad carpet of the ground. But ah! the air is faint with weariness Of toil and love is grown a doubtful dream, That now no longer, type of holiness, Regilds the shapes of faded things that seem And are not in our world! The sad ghosts stream Toward the darkness; and my sense can seize No touch of reverent peace or grateful ease, No waft of tender fancy in the sky, No Phœbus standing, dawn-red, on the hill — And must e'en feed itself on memory And with those strains of old its yearning fill, Whose echo at my heart-strings lingers still — Unable to revive the ancient flame, Sadly some phantom of its brightness frame. Fair flowery city, peerless in the world, Germ-garden of the golden blooms of Art, But seldom have thy myrtle-groves impearled So fair a creature in their flowerful heart As young Salvestra. Could my song impart Her manifold perfections, well I deem My verse should glow with glories of a dream. So fair she was, there is no rose so fair That in the noon drinks colour from the sun: No flower could match the hyacinths of her hair, Fresh from the webs of night and morning spun: Her eyes were lakes, whereon, when day is done, The slow night comes with halt and timorous pace, And dim dreams fill the enchanted interspace. There was the house of dreams; and on her brow — Clear as the marge of that cool well where Pan Was wont to play with Pitys — broad and low With trellised ringlets — ended and began All glamours that can charm the heart of man: There was the crystal dwelling of the Loves And there bright Venus fed her golden doves. What hues can paint her mouth, what words express The ivory shaft of her most perfect throat? And what her bosom's rounded perfectness? That with the heaving breath did swell and float, As if its snows had lately learnt by rote The rapturous carol of some woodland bird And to the cadence ever mutely stirred. The very sun did gently look on her And only kissed, not burnt, her crystal brows: Among her locks the flower-breathed winds did stir And filled them with the perfumes of the rose And scents of foreign sweets that no man knows, But haply ravished from those plains of spice That lengthen out the glades of Paradise. So fair she was, her sight had virtue in 't: The vision of her face was used to stir Strange deeps of love. Full many a heart of flint Was softened, when men's eyes did look on her: Like violets in the morning of the year, There was a perfume went from her that drew Men's careworn souls to tender thoughts and true. If all things loved her, even the fierce sun, And breezes for her wooing came from far, How should Girolamo's young bosom shun The keen sweet shaft of Love's unpardoning star, Wherewith so many hearts enwounded are? Or how play traitor to the general fate, He, whom the heavens had surely made for mate Of that unparagoned brightness? If on earth The gods had guerdoned and appointed one To be conjoined with her in house of birth, Girolamo was sure that Fortune's son. His life, with hers in equal hour begun, Had from the same breast drawn its aliment And all the currents of their youth were blent Within a common channel. Childhood was Dual for them with doubled love and pain; And with unseparate course the years did pass For them along the primrose-tufted plain Of early youth; till, when the rise and wane Of the recurrent Springs began to tend Toward that spot where times of childhood end, Where laughing girl puts on grave womanhood And youth is sudden man, the innocent ties, That had so long entwined the two, renewed Their power. As thought grew in Salvestra's eyes, The ancient childish amity did rise In his young breast the olden banks above And swelled into a deep and passionate love. If she was dark as Night and vague and rare As star-bright evening, thick with netted lights, He was as frank and bright and golden-fair As a May morn, when on the sapphire heights Of heaven the young day comes with all delights And tender glories of the dewy dawn And wild flowers wake on every woodland lawn. It seemed the sun shone always on his brow, Among his locks' full-clustered tender gold, Whose every shadow with rich light did glow; And his true eyes were cast in passion's mould, So fair a deep of love, all aureoled With hope, did lurk within their amethyst, Whose lids Diana might have stooped and kiss'd. There looked from out his face so clear a Spring Of love and youth, so pure and undefiled By care or baseness, that no birds that sing Among the trellis—when the boughs are piled With blossom and the sweet lush vines run wild With early clusters—cared to hide from him, If to the carol of their morning hymn He crept to listen through the flush of flowers; No fawn but laid the velvet of its mouth Upon his beckoning hand: the fear that sours All creatures at man's aspect ('spite the drouth Of love that habits all the sunny South) Fled from him, as the plague flies from the breath Of some sweet fragrance, enemy to Death. There was in him a candid fearlessness And frank delight of love, that drew men back, Regarding him, from out the cheerlessness Of modern life, along the dim years' track, To the old age, when hate nor fear nor rack Of rueful discord held the enchanted air, But all were loving, kind and debonair; When love was not a virtue, but a sense, A natural impulse of untainted souls, That had no thought of praise or recompense For what was but an instinct, and the goals, Tow'rd which our life's sore-troubled current rolls, Had not yet darkened all the innocent air With lurid lights of greed and lust and care. To him to love was natural as life: He drew in passion with his daily breath; Affection was his food, and hate and strife To him the very atmosphere of death; His soul was one of those to which the faith In love and friendship is a part of being, And—that withdrawn—there is for them no fleeing From anguish and the death-stroke of despair: Once hurt, they have but strength enough to die, Since in life's desert there is nothing fair For them, when love has lost its potency And the first dream has vanished from the sky. And so he loved as (men do say) of old The first folk loved, within the age of gold. There was no like respondence of delight In fair Salvestra; for her weaker mood Sufficed not for the all-subduing might Of love that raged in his more ardent blood; Her earthlier nature from that angels' food Of perfect passion ever failed and shrank. She knew not Love, though at her eyes he drank, Though in her mouth his flowers were fresh and red, His magic in each tangle of her hair Was hidden; all was cold as are the dead, And no one note of ecstasy was there, To stir to splendour the unthrobbing air. No glamours of the tender haze of love Lay ever those clear orbs of hers above, Such as are sweeter to a lover's gaze Than brightest radiance of untroubled bliss— No touch of tender sadness, such as lays Soft lips to lips with such a rapturous kiss. In her most glorious face, the soul did miss The informing ardour of some subtle charm, Whose absence chilled the Summer sweet and warm That there bloomed ever: and the missing note Left to the wish, in every harmony Of loveliness that round her face did float, A formless longing, as of some sweet sky, In whose moon-flooded purple canopy Of silver star-work set in amethyst, The very star of evening should be miss'd. They were alike unequal in estate. His father was a merchant of renown, That had held highest office in the state; For whom a name of honour, handed down Through many an ancestor, had slowly grown And ripened to great increase of repute: In him the tree had born its fairest fruit Of worship. He had of his native town Been three times prior: wealth and dignities Had bound his temples with a various crown Of splendid memories. His argosies Had swept for treasure all the Indian seas, Heaping his hands with gorgeous pearl and gold And ingots cast in many an Orient mould. So for Girolamo there was prepared A goodly heritage, and his ripening age Might to all heights of eminence have dared To look for honour and all noble rage For dignities have counted to assuage, Being by birth set in that charmed ring, Wherein the flowers of honour use to spring. His foster-sister was that fairest one: She was the daughter of a clothworker. Unto whose wife his little weakling son, Born well-nigh in an equal hour with her, Girolamo's own sire did, many a year, Commit for fosterance; and so the twain Together knew life's earliest joy and pain. Surely some power had breathed strange spells on them, To weave their fortunes in a mingled skein; Some flower of Fate had blossomed on its stem A double calyx, in some sweet domain Of herbs and charms where (as old fables feign) Fair wives do sit and weave with knitted flowers The changeful fortunes of this life of ours; With knitted wreaths, not woven all of rose Or lavish jasmine in the gold of June Or delicate sweetness of the flower that blows In April, when the harsh winds breathe in tune To Spring's fresh music and the ways are strewn With violets. Rosemary is there and rue And sad-eyed scabious with the petals blue. There cypress grows for garlands funeral And there the dim and tearful lilies blow; Sad hemlock for dead lovers' coronal And nightshade, bitter at the heart for woe. There not alone the lark and linnet throw Spring's wealth of music on the enamoured air And throstles sing that Summer is most fair; But there full oft the widowed nightingale Lengthens her holy sadness into song And many a night-bird fills the air with wail: Dead love sings there with cadence sad and long And there the dread sweet tunes are clear and strong, That in the hearts of weary folk are dumb; Since sorrow is too fair to have outcome In its most perfect strain from mortal throat Or dare with its most holy notes and pure The gross encounter of this world of rote, Where men know not the sweets its pains procure. So in this garden only doth endure Divinity of sadness, 'mid the throng Of joyful sounds a holy intersong. Surely, the nymphs that wove the earthly fate Of these two lovers,—whilst their white hands played With amaranths and violets and the state Of roses for the crown of youth and maid,— Had heard these singing that the rose must fade, Nesh violets wither from their fragrant bloom Nor amaranths of love evade death's doom; And sighing, laid a rose or two aside And chosen herbs of sadness and of woe, White wind-flowers and pale pansies, dreamy-eyed, And evergreens of cypress, that do blow When all green else has withered from the snow, — Mindful that love is fed with Summer's breath, But sorrow dies not, though the air be death. The star of lovers, that upon the birth Of these two lovelings shed its saddest rays, Had but thenceforward glimmered on the earth A little span of nights and equal days, When from his walking in the pleasant ways Of life his father ceased and did commit Unto his widow's care, in all things fit For his son's heritage to govern him. And she, a noble lady, fair and high, Queenlike in goodly port and graceful limb, But hard and stern withal, did her apply Unto the matter well and faithfully, Ordering his state and household passing well, In all the things where need to her befell. So for Girolamo the first years went Peacefully by in pleasance and delight, And all his years of youth he was content To dwell with her his mother; nor despite The heat of youthful blood, did aught invite His peaceful thought to seek to be set free From her control or larger liberty. For such a perfect passion filled his heart, So strong and therewithal so innocent, That in his hope no thing could have a part, Wherewith Salvestra's presence was unblent; And all his thought on her was so intent, It seemed his youth should never pass away, Whilst in her eyes love met him day by day. He sought no fellowship with anyone, Bearing no share in chase or revelry; But in his love's companionship alone He lived, disdaining all delights that she Must leave unshared, and careful but to be Beloved of her: for him, she being kind, No other thing could touch his constant mind. For him, the treasure of her love contained And did annul with its most perfect light All things for which he saw men sought and strained. There was for him no other ear-delight Than her sweet speech, no other charm of sight Than her fair presence, and (she being gone) No bliss save dreams of her from dusk to dawn. His life to her was wholly consecrate; She had no hope in which he did not share; She was for either sorry or elate; So twinned he was to her in joy and care, It seemed as if some charm upon him were, Whereby his soul its stature had forgone And for pure love her weakness had put on. How should a lover of such perfect fire As this fair youngling, in the blush and heat Of the first passion, find aught to desire In her that lets herself be loved? So sweet It was to love, he could no more entreat Than she would give him look for look and kiss For longing kiss, and from the deep abyss Of his unfailing passion could supply Unconsciously the warmth that lacked in her, Holding her coldness in such constancy And ceaseless ardentness of love, the stir Of the celestial flame that folded her, Kissing her marble with ethereal fire, Some semblance raised of its own pure desire. And at her feet, in that unsullied time, The golden harvest of his young life's Spring He laid, outpouring all the lavish prime Of his first hope, the bright ingathering Of that clear time of youth, when every thing Blossoms to beauty with the radiant hours And all the thoughts are lovely unknown flowers. He made his love for her one long sweet song Of various cadence, filling every break Of gradual days with many a glittering throng Of flower-new fancies, till, as some grey brake From Spring's soft hands its robe of blooms doth take, Her lesser life caught blossom at his smile And was all glorified with love awhile. So for a few sweet years their lives were blent In mingled ways of love and innocence, And no fear came to mar the sweet content Of that untroubled season; but their sense Slept in a linked enchantment, folded dense And sweet as Summer-woods, that stand screen-wise Betwixt the world and some clear Paradise. (Ah lovely time of love and purity! April before the summer heats draw nigher! What thing on earth is pleasant like to thee, Whilst yet the veils lie folded round the fire Of the insatiate conquering Desire, When all things tremble with the dews of Spring And love is mystery and wondering? Ah! frail as sweet thy tender blossoms are, Shortlived as primroses that blow in Spring And die whilst yet the Summer shines afar Nor May has set the swallows on the wing. Thy strain is as the birds' descant that sing In haunted woods a dreamy song and clear And cease, if any stay his steps to hear.) For years, none knew the bondage of delight That bound these lovers (nor themselves as yet Perchance had learnt to name their ties aright;) But unobserved of any eye they met And took their ease of kiss and amorette; Till, at the last, chance broke the happy spell Of secrecy; and on this wise it fell. The palace, where for many years bygone His ancestors had dwelt, a little space Without the city's ramparts stood withdrawn, Fronting the silver river with the grace Of its tall turrets, wreathed on every face With flowers and shrubs, through which the white house shone Like some dream-stead the sunset lies upon. Hard by the house a little wood there was, Tow'rd which the garden sloped its slow descent Adown long sunny banks of smoothen grass, With chalices of Summer thick besprent; And through the sward a silver brooklet went And made sweet music to the amorous breeze, Until it wound among the shadowing trees. Full of bird-song and scent of forest-flowers The coppice was, and very sweet and cool In the hot noontide were its trellised bowers, Set by the glass of some dream-haunted pool, Whereon the sleepy sweetness of the lull Of silence brooded; and its every glen Was set with purple of the cyclamen Or starred with white of amaryllis blooms, Pale flower-dreams of the virginal green sward, That made faint sweetness in the emerald glooms: And through the stillness ever rose and soared The song of some up-mounting lark, that poured The gold of his delight for rose-hung June Into the channel of a perfect tune. Here did these lovers often use to walk, Calling the flowers to witness of their love, Mocking, in sport, with sweet and murmurous talk, The tender cooing of the amorous dove, That filled the arches of the boughs above And echoed through the cloisters, — sat anon Upon some lilied bank and there did con, In rapturous silence, every lovely look, Each blush of eloquent cheek and glow of eyes, Reading sweet stories in that lovers' book Of joining faces, with soft wind of sighs To fan their joyance, — as a breeze that dies, Bending two neighbour roses till they meet, — And now all sunned with laughters low and sweet. It chanced, one Summer, as the lovers went For joyance in the pleasant woodland ways, — Rejoicing in the tender thymy scent And in the sweet attemperance of the blaze Of noon that reigned within the forest maze, — The Countess walked, for ease of the fierce heat, In that fair garden, where the lawns were sweet With lavish fall of rose-leaves; and anon The cool sweet promise of the wood did woo Her feet to enter where the sunlight shone Athwart thick leafage and the sky showed blue Through rifted boughs; and walking thus, she knew The sound of voices mingled in converse Murmurous and sweet, as birds that did rehearse Some new sweet descant for the ear of night: And listening closelier, as the voices drew The nearer, she was ware that Love's delight Was theme of that soft speaking and she knew The silver speech of kisses, that ensue The vows of love, as music follows on With strain on strain, in some sweet antiphon; And curious to know what folk these were, That walked in woods for love and solacement, Under the shadow of the boughs drew near Beside the shaded path, where, all intent Each upon each, hand-linked these lovers went: So low they spoke, she could not catch their words Aright, for chatter of the clamorous birds And gurgle of the stream betwixt the trees. But in the middle way the sun had found A place of branches rifted by the breeze And stealing through the opening to the ground, Had thrown a pool of golden light around; And as the twain passed where the sunlight shone, She recognised Salvestra and her son. Then much despite gat hold upon her soul And sorely she was troubled in her mind; For shame it seemed to her and bitter dole That thus a low-born maiden had entwined Her son with arts; and sore she sought to find Some means whereby he should be won to break The chains he wore for sweet Salvestra's sake. Crouched in the shadow of the thick-set leaves, She waited, while the twain passed on their way Out of the wood; and where the forest-eaves Bent o'er the highway, there she saw them lay Lips unto lips, as 'twere the last that day: And then they parted, she toward the town Wending, with hasting feet and girded gown. But he a little stood, with longing eyes Following her form along the highway's white, Until,—when all the power in Love that lies Availed not to retain her in his sight,— Sighing as one that lapses from delight, He pushed the gate that opened from the street And wandered up the garden with slow feet. And wandering thus, he came to where the fount Smote the blue air with one thin silver spire And in like gracious fashion did dismount Into the jewelled pool, that lay afire With golden carp,—and rising again higher, Did seem to image some fair perfect love, That, lowlier stooping, soars the more above. And there, beside the tinkle of the stream, Himself he laid upon the rose-strewn grass And in the sweet ensuing of his dream Of bliss, saw not his mother that did pass Swiftly by him, with mien and look, alas! That of a truth forebode despite and ill To that fair love which all his thoughts did fill. (Ah, Love! Ah, fair god Love! it wearieth me To think how many work to do thee ill,— How many in this grey sad world there be That strive alway thy gracious power to kill And hinder those that do thy gentle will! Forsooth, it is great wonder that away From earth thou hast not fled this many a day. For of a truth, fair God, my soul is sad For these two lovers and the coming blight That those who hate thy gentle spells and glad Have conjured up to slay their hearts' delight; And sore it irks me that the goodly light Of such a sweet Spring-day should change and fade, For men's despite, to death's unfriendly shade. And yet take heart, God of the soul's delight! No hate shall slay thy tender empery: The day is not more sure of the sun's sight Nor Spring of flowers, than that there aye shall be Maidens and youths to offer prayers to thee,— Ay, sure as death,—and singers, too, to sing In every age of Love's fair triumphing. So, in all lovers' names and in the name Of all true men that set their hearts to song, I lay a life-long curse on those that frame Sad wiles and false to poison Love with wrong And wear out passion with the anguish long Of parting,—ay, grey life I invoke for them And death unsanctified by requiem Of choiring linnets. Never flower of Spring Shall blossom in their lives, nor fruit of peace Ripen their summer long to harvesting; But with the years their sadness shall increase And shadow them: and when dull life shall cease, Their heads shall lie unmemoried in the gloom, Nor lovers wander by their flowerless tomb.) But that fair haughty lady, being come Into the house, began to cast about Within herself to bring to pass the doom Of parting for these lovers: without doubt It seemed to her, that if she opened out Her mind to him, he could not choose but bow Unto her will, as always until now. But first, intent upon a milder way, She sought Girolamo and so began To work toward her wish with words that lay Like foam upon the waves and overran Her purpose, saying that well-nigh a man He now was grown and how the need was great That he should presently to man's estate Advance himself in things of daily use And knowledge of the ways and works of men, To end that he might fit himself to choose Some station in the world, coming to ken All things wrought out with sword and speech and pen And all the stir of folk, that day by day Beat up the wave of life to foam and spray. And meet it seemed (to him she did pursue) That for the better ripening of his youth In all things liberal and knowledge due, He should leave idling in that sunny South,— That treacherous mother with the red bane-mouth,— And for awhile in lands of colder air Temper his thought and learn new senses there. But he took little heed of her discourse, Hearing her speech but as a devious dream, That through the channels of a sleep doth course, With trains of doubtful words, that do but seem And leave no memory by the morning's beam; And all the while he answered not or made Some mutter of reply, that nothing weighed. Till, for her useless wiles, the pent-up spite Began to break the chains of prudentness, And with harsh words unto the hapless wight She did pour forth her heart's full bitterness Against Salvestra and her rage no less Against himself, upbraiding him full sore For those fond foolish fetters that he wore: And ended by commandment laid on him That he should do her bidding in this wise And for awhile,—until the thought grew dim Of that his folly,—under foreign skies Avoid the witchcraft of Salvestra's eyes; So haply, being come to man's estate, He should have wit to choose a worthier mate: And adding many a false and feignèd tale, She did oppress his sad and aching ears, Until at last with lies she did prevail Upon her son to yield his will to hers And lose his lady's sight for two long years, Wherein she hoped Salvestra should be wed, Or else the love of her in him be dead. Therewith Girolamo, enforced by guile, Took leave of that fair Florence and the sight Of his Salvestra,—and full many a mile Journeying by land and sea, unto that bright And goodly city came, that Paris hight, Wherein all loveliest ladies use to dwell And many a fair lord of whom men tell. For, of a truth, in that fair country France Has ever been the home of love and song: There knights have done fair deeds with sword and lance; And if by hazard any suffer wrong, I' faith therein he shall not suffer long, Nor any lady lack to be redrest, Whilst any lord of France have spear in rest. And verily, if they be brave and fair, — The knights and damozels that dwell therein, — The land is beautiful beyond compare And worthy of its children: therewithin The earth is thick with lilies and the din Of nightingales and every sweet-voiced bird All night among its rose-gardens is heard. And of that goodly land, the pearl of flowers, The queen-rose of the garland Paris is, Paris white-walled, that from its fragrant bowers Rises tall-steepled, full of pleasaunces And gardens sweet with jasmine and with lys And palaces that glitter in the air, Less fair alone than ladies dwelling there: Paris, whose life is like a dream-delight Of splendid memories, where the very walls, Glowing with old-world splendours, charm the sight With tales of hero-life; and trumpet-calls Re-echo from the golden-fretted halls, Telling how women loved and men were strong, And poets set their lives in golden song. Salvestra. The seven stanzas in italics, beginning “Ah land of roses, etc.” and written in January 1871, shortly before the capitulation of Paris, were first published, under the title of “France”, in my “Songs of Life and Death”, 1872, and are now restored to their original place, as part of “Salvestra”. It must, I fear, be confessed that the sympathy here expressed for the native land of Gautier and Gobineau was altogether literary, the personal sentiment of an enthusiastic Romanticist, who counted many dear friends among French men of letters, artists and musicians, and whose passionate feelings of admiration and gratitude for the colossal benefits conferred upon European literature and art by the literary giants of 1830 and their worthy successors of the Neo-Romantic school, combined with the natural abhorrence, common to all honest men, of the sinister tripotages of Prussian policy, by which the French were entrapped into the disastrous war of 1870—1, overrode for the moment his innate detestation of French political methods and tendencies,—methods and tendencies which have been uniformly pernicious both to France herself and to Europe generally, from the time of Richelieu to the present day and more especially since the horrible events of the French Revolution, when France crippled herself for all time (or, at least, as is declared by one of her greatest patriots and philosophers, Auguste de Gobineau, until she shall have been renovated and restored to national sanity by reconquest at the hands of a more virile race, a declaration evidently made in anticipation of an ultimate renewal of the English occupation of the 15th century,) by the wanton extirpation, at the instance of a handful of reckless and heartless ruffians, of her whole governing class of the old Frank stock, leaving herself with nothing but the politically worthless Gallo-Roman residuum to meet the administrative demands of the future. (Ah, land of roses! France, my love of lands! How art thou fallen from thy high estate! Bleeding, thou writhest in the Vandals' hands And the crowned spoiler sitteth in thy gate. My heart is sore for thee: I weep and wait; Shall not God help thee and deliver thee From whom the world has taken liberty? Thou France, the fairest and the holiest, The knightly people, hating every wrong, Hast thou so long redeemed the world opprest, Sacring the Right with sword and sword-swift song, Hast thou so many a year for us been strong To slay the doubt, to unveil the hopeful years, And now, alas! sittest alone in tears? Alone and bleeding; for the Wrong prevails, The dragon-crested Wrong, that, like a snake, Growing, shall strangle in its loathsome scales All loveliness of life, all hopes that break The grinding chains of toil, all songs that wake Under the flower-blue skies, all knightly use And level all to its abhorred abuse. For this is he that in the name of Right Has strangled many a nation; this is he That holds all noble faith, all honour light, That let the lust of his rapacity; He that, exulting from a bloody sea, Calls God his helper; he that, void of shame, Robs, lies and murders in the Holy Name. Alas, that men are blind or will not see! Our Saviour France, the lover of mankind, Lies bound and bleeding, straining piteously Against the brutal tyrant: on the wind Her cries for help assail us; but we, blind With some prophetic blindness, turn aside, Saying, ‘She sinned; her doom let her abide.’ And yet take heart, O land of many tears! We are not powerless that love thee well: Our songs float up to Heaven and God hears Our psalms of vengeance. Fair and terrible, The hour shall come to break the evil spell: Live! for we love thee. Shall not love be strong? Arise and conquer, fortified with song! Our love thy banner! We are manifold: Though men contemn us, we are strong in faith, We that are taintless with the greed of gold, We for whom Love is mightier than Death; We hail thee with a hope! As with one breath, We bid thee conquer — 'spite the scorn of men — And slay the twy-necked Vulture in his den!) Two dragging years, two full-told weary years In that fair town Girolamo did dwell Unwillingly, — for all his mind with fears Was racked, and on his thought the cruel spell Of some vague misery lay and made a hell Of every thing and every pleasant spot, Where the fair face of her he loved was not. Nor was there any damozel so fair Of all the lovely ladies that he saw Walk beautiful about the gardens there Or ride a-hawking in green field and shaw, That could anew subdue him to Love's law: He counted all their lovely looks for nought, For his love's face was ever in his thought. And so, when those two weary years were past, Wherein he had been exiled from delight, And he was free to turn his feet at last To Florence, well I wot his heart was light, To think he should regain Salvestra's sight; And not a thought of sorrow held his mind, For all the pleasant things he left behind. But, with a heart inflamed with long desire And love that on itself so long had fed, That it had taken for its food of fire All other thoughts, across the sea he sped And came to Florence, wearying to tread The earth that bore Salvestra and to press Once more within his arms her loveliness. Alas! he thought not what a hapless thing Is absence and how easily far love Is apt to fall off from remembering. Knowing there was no creature fair enough Nor any chance that could prevail above The fortress of his heart, how should he fear Less constancy in her he held so dear? So, when he knew, as very soon he knew, (Ah me, ill hap hath no relenting wing!) That she, by whom alone the sky was blue And the day sweet to him,—dishonouring Her plighted faith to him,—was wed with ring, The fulness of his misery smote him not At first. As one that in the heart is shot So suddenly that at the first he seems Untouched by wound, yet presently he falls Stone-dead,—or like a man that walks in dreams And sees each thing that unto him befalls As others' fortune,—through the palace-halls He went, all dazed, among old memories, As one that looks and knows not what he sees. And at his heart some vague disease did gnaw, Sapping the springs of life, so that he cared For nought nor took delight in aught he saw Or heard; but like a soul in doom he fared Aimlessly here and there, and no man dared To stay his feet or strive to comfort him; For all his gentle visage pale and grim Was grown; and if one spoke to him, he gazed A moment in his face with witless eyes, But answered not and left him all amazed. Even when his mother pressed him,—weary-wise He broke from her, filling the air with sighs: And for the indulgence of his lonely mood, He did betake himself into the wood. And there, at last, the sweet familiar dells And woodways, where he wont to walk of old With his Salvestra, and the rewrought spells Of birds' descant and flowers and summer-gold, Wherewith his happy memories were enscrolled, (That now, alas! were poison), broke his trance And made him ware of all his heavy chance. And when at length the full and fatal sense Of all his misery possessed his brain, The anguish of wanhope was so intense, That his weak body failed him for the pain: Well-nigh it wrought to break the enfeebled chain Of life; and in a fever, many a day, Nigh unto death unconsciously he lay. But yet the strength of his supreme desire Once more to look upon his lady's face, Mightier than death, prevailed against the fire Of that fell sickness: with a halting pace, Sad life came back to its accustomed place And from his bed he rose, a weary man, Wasted with fever, pale and weak and wan; And for the staying of his longing pain, Bethought him first where he might chance to meet Salvestra's eyes and hear her voice again: For he could not believe, the memories sweet Of the old time and all their ancient heat Of love could fail to stir her heart and bring Her soul back to him with remembering: Nor could he think, still less, that she had proved False to her faith of her unfettered will; But rather deemed that she to it was moved By force or by some sad disloyal skill Of slander, that so many loves doth kill,— And doubted not, in spite of all the let Of years and duties, but she loved him yet. For all the wealth of love bestowed on her And garnered up within his heart so long Seemed surety to him that there yet must stir Some love in her, unknown belike, yet strong; And as within the bird's throat sleeps the song, Dumb for captivity, that yet the view Of all his native woods would wake anew, So, at his sight, he could not choose but deem, The old frank faith would wake in her afresh, And like the tangles of some doubtful dream, She would shake off from her the weary mesh Of falseness and her eyes on his afresh Rain love and truth, her lips once more rejoice Him with the constant sweetness of her voice, Renewing the dissevered bonds of love: And then the days of doubt should pass away And be but as some mist that hangs above The certain summer of an August day, A little while, and tempers the sun-ray,— And all the ancient bliss return to him, A brighter noon because the dawn was dim. Wherefore he set himself to haunt the ways Where she was wont to pass,—the market-place, The square before the church on holidays, The paths tree-shadowed and the flower-set space Beside the river,—watching for her face Morning and noon and night, as one in pain Looks for the face of Death; but long in vain. At length at the church door he met with her, Leant on her husband's arm and listening, Well-pleased, to what he whispered. Lovelier She seemed than she of his remembering Unto Girolamo; and a double sting Ran through his heart, to look on her so fair And know those fatal charms another's were. By him, held dumb by hope and fear, she past And by some hap, chancing to lift her eyes, Straight on his face her starry glance she cast And looked at him a space; but in no wise Her lover's form she seemed to recognise, (Perchance for he was still with fever wan) But saw him as a stranger and passed on. Full long, I ween, he deemed his death at hand, Being (it seemed) of his last hope deprived; But once again the expiring spark was fanned Into a flame, (so strong a hope is hived In lovers' breasts) and there once more revived The wish of life in him, that he might prove To end the doubtful fortune of his love. For it might be (his hope 'gan whisper him) That she had looked on him and known him not, Seeing he was so changed in face and limb By that fell fever, or some spell had got Empire on her, whereby she had forgot The memory of their wooing and the face Of him her lover, for a little space. And if (as well he deemed that it might be) Some fatal charm were laid upon her sight, He trusted to dispel that sorcery By prayers and offerings and the happy might Of counterspells; and thus, the sad despite Of fortune foiled, she should possess again Her memory and take pity on his pain. Wherefore by day and night long prayers he prayed To many a saint, and to that Lady bright, That rules the skies, rich offerings he made, To gain her grace, sparing not day or night To crave her intercession to relight The old love in Salvestra, nor did cease To wear her chapel's marble with his knees. Nor did he trust alone in stress of prayer To break the sorcery of that opiate spell; But every occult influence did he dare, Invoking the divided powers of Hell To heal her blindness whom he loved so well, Culling night-herbs and on a scroll blood-writ Burning strange cipherings beyond man's wit. And then, at last, when every prayer was vain And no spell seemed to stand his hope in stead, Seeing she passed him often and again And gave no sign of cognizance, but sped Upon her way with an averted head, And not a word or look of hers exprest Renewal of his image in her breast, He would not even then lay hope aside, But comforted himself, despite his pain, With the firm thought that there must needs abide Some memory of him within her brain, Which though his sight had failed to wake again, (Being, as he was, so changed and strange to her) The cadence of his speech should surely stir. And so about within himself he cast How he should win to have her privately To speak with him, proposing in this last Attempt to set his life upon the die; But often as Salvestra passed him by In streets or on the church's steps of stone, He could not win to speak with her alone. Wherefore, made bold by his supreme despair, He did resolve to seek her, spite of all, Even in her husband's house, and being there, To make one last endeavour to recall Her love to him, whatever might befall; And if, alack! his prayers should find no grace, He might at least die looking on her face. He knew her husband was a tent-maker And dwelt, with many others of his trade, In a long street, that folk for many a year Called “Street of Tentmakers.” At back there strayed The river; and between, long gardens made A pleasaunce for the burghers, very fair With tree-shade and the river running there. Thither one afternoon he did betake Himself, what time the sultry Summer day Grew faint and in the flower-beds and the brake The fierceness of the sunlight died away. Beneath a starry myrtle-bush he lay And watched the glitter of the noon subside, Across the running ripples of the tide. And there, unseen, he waited, purposing,— When night was fallen on the scented air And once the nightingales were waked to sing,— To make his secret way (if means there were And night were favouring and debonair) Into Salvestra's chamber and contrive At least to speak with her once more alive. Full wearily the unwilling day wore on: It seemed to him the light would never die: Across the west like blood the sunset shone; And to his sense, as sadly he did lie, The wafts of air seemed laden heavily With incense for the dying and the surge Of ripples sounded like a funeral dirge. At length the lagging daylight made an end Of gradual death; and to the grateful night He heard the sweet sound of the bells ascend From many a convent-steeple in his sight; The dusky town put forth pale buds of light; He heard the throb of lute-strings, and afar The silver chirp of some soft-swept guitar. Then from his bed among the flowers he rose, And with the careless step of one who dares A lawless act and heedeth not who knows, Being so sick at heart that nought he cares For aught that can befall him, up the stairs Of stone he went and pushed against the door, That swung ajar, yielding his hand before. And entering, through the humble rooms he went, Noting the traces of Salvestra's hand, That everywhere some grace of neatness lent To the poor dwelling. Here, a little stand,— Wherein tall lilies, twined about a wand, Hallowed the air with perfume,—there, the gold And silver of the jasmine-blooms, enscrolled About the little casement,—told their tale Of her sweet ministry; and with each trace Of her, fresh anguish did his heart assail, To think another's home possessed her grace, Another's hearth was lighted by her face: And haply had he chanced her then to meet, He might have fallen lifeless at her feet. But all alone about the house he trod, And no one stayed or asked him what he did; For so it chanced, Salvestra was abroad, With Paolo her husband. Unforbid, He wandered sadly here and there, amid The tokens of her presence, without aim, Until into her bed-chamber he came. There freshlier still the signs of her abode Did crowd on him; the ribbon that she wore For festivals, the shining glass that showed Her eyes her beauty,—all the pretty store Of women's toys: and eke the table bore A silver rose he gave her on its stem, When love was in the summer-time for them. The pretty bauble's sight brimmed up his eyes, At the sad thought that such a toy should keep Its pristine brightness, when his Paradise And all the roses of his hope so deep In death did sleep the unremembering sleep; And oft with many kisses did he press That senseless relic of past happiness. At last he heard a footstep on the stair And ran to hide himself behind a heap Of tent-cloths standing in a corner there, Thinking concealèd there himself to keep, Until, perchance, when Paolo should sleep, He might come forth and gently her awake: And haply she on him would pity take Nor rouse her sleeping husband, but at worst Give ear to his sad pleading for the sake Of all the gentle memories of erst: Mayhap, the cruel ice in her should break And some soft pity at the least awake In her, so she should speak some kindly word, Which he might die more gladly having heard. The chamber-door swung open and she came, One hand about her husband's neck entwined; Whilst, in the other hand, the taper's flame Leant to the lazy flutter of the wind: And as its flickering gleam upon her shined, It seemed the amorous shade did strive for place With the dim light, upon her lovely face. The weary wight, tired with the sultry day And the long labour, on the couch flung down His stalwart limbs, and soon asleep he lay: But she, unfastening her tresses' crown, Let down their sable flood, that all did drown Her form, until she gathered them again And set her to comb out each silken skein. Lingering awhile before her glass she stood, Joying to look upon her lovely face, And with a musing sweet content reviewed The perfect harmony of every grace: Then, with unhasting hands, each envious lace She did unloose, that bound her body fair, And stood all naked in her floating hair. (Ah! not for me her loveliness to sing And the rich sweetness of each pearly limb! My song would droop its slow and faltering wing, Did I enforce its weakness to that hymn Of silver splendours or my pen to limn The sweet snows of her breast and the delight Of her clear body's symphony of white. I would I could command his lyre of gold, That sang that Marie loved of Chastelard, Or his full harp, that of fair Nyssia told, Guarding her jealous beauty like a star, Or else his silver lute, whose ladies are Florise and Cypris and that Goddess bright That leads the silver lapses of the night.) Alas! my heart is sore for his despite That saw his love, that never should be his, Then first unveil her beauties to his sight! It was as if before some soul, that is In flames of hell, a dream of heaven's bliss Were conjured up to mock his anguished sense And make his thought of horror more intense. He would have called to her,—but could nor speak Nor move; it seemed some strange and fettering swoon Compelled his sense, so sick he was and weak With waste desire. Till she put off her shoon And covering the lamp, let in the moon That filled the chamber with its argent tide; Then laid her by her sleeping husband's side. Now was the hour at hand when he should prove The last device of his resolved despair: And yet awhile he could not win to move, But gazed full long upon her sleeping there, Pillowed within a fragrant cloud of hair, With parted lips and heaving breasts, that shone Like lilies on a lake by moonlight wan. At last he did shake off the numbing spell That held his sense in bonds of stirlessness; And from his place he crept with feet that fell As noiselessly as fairies' feet that press The dewdropt grass. The room was shadowless; Her husband slept the heavy sleep of toil; And the void lamp had wasted all its oil. Upon his knees beside the bed he sank, As one that kneels before a virgin shrine, And with long looks of yearning sadness drank Her lovely sight. All bathed in white moonshine, Stirless she lay; and on her lidded eyne Such peace abode, one might have deemed it death, Save for the fluttering witness of her breath. At length, with tremulous touch and wavering, His hand he laid upon her ivory breast, That for a moment stayed its fluttering And throbbed uneasily, as if opprest: But yet therefore ceased not Salvestra's rest; So feather-light his tender touch did lie, She did but flutter out a gentle sigh. Then, bending o'er the cover of the bed, He set his lips upon her sleep-sealed eyes And eke upon her mouth's twin flowers of red, As softly as a fallen flower, that lies And floats upon a river, lily-wise. Still did she sleep; and he, grown bolder still, Of clinging kisses took his thirsty fill. Ah, when was lover true yet satisfied With lovers' food of kisses warm and sweet? He would have kissed and kissed, until there died The life in him; but, as his lips did meet And clung to hers more close, the sudden heat Quickened the throbbing pulses of her heart And forced the ivory gates of sleep apart. Her heavy lids drew up and loosed the light Captive within their envious prison-sleep; And as his kneeling figure met her sight, The drowsy sweetness, that her eyes did steep, Into a pretty fearfulness did leap; And for her sheer affright she would have cried, But in her throat the words sank down and died. For in his face, bent down towards her own, The lamp of such a perfect love was lit, And in his sad clear eyes the peace alone Of such a loveful gentleness was writ, She could not seek for any fear in it, But lay and looked on him, with still surprise Rounding the sleepy sweetness of her eyes. Then, “Sleepest thou, my love of loves?” he said: And at his voice, the thoughts, that in her breast Had for long absence and the years lain dead, Upon her in a crowd of memories prest. Like birds returning to their last year's nest, The words and deeds of the sweet time of yore Rose up and lived before her thought once more. And with the memory, such a fretful tide Of struggling fancies did oppress her brain, That for relief aloud she would have cried And help; but as to speak she strove in vain, He spoke once more and prayed her to refrain, For 'twas Girolamo, whom she had loved, In the old days, alas! so far removed. Then with soft words to her he did recall The linked delight of those unsullied days, When each to each was lovers' all in all And wrought with other in Love's pleasant praise, Heart joined to heart; and in all tender ways Love could contrive to work upon her grace, He did entreat her fairly to retrace The vanished paths of faith, to turn aside From the deceitful ways in which her feet Had lately wandered,—since false lips had lied Surely to her of him,—and once more greet, With those long looks of love that were so sweet, His thirsty eyes, that had of her fair sight Bereavèd been so many a day and night. And with full many a piteous device He strove to turn her heart again to him And conjure back the lovelight in her eyes, Recounting how, when absence was so grim And sad to him, her face had ne'er grown dim Within his memory, but, clear and fair, The thought of her was with him everywhere. And how all fairest ladies of the land, Where damozels are loveliest, had failed To move the heart he left within her hand, And how no pleasant sight or sport prevailed To win his thought to gladness, that bewailed, 'Mid proudest feast and music's silveriest swell, His banishment from her he loved so well. Nor did he fail to paint his great despair And all the springs of life dried up and waste, And how for him thenceforth no thing was fair Enough, no joy of living could he taste, That might retain his weary soul, in haste To break the chains of that abhorrent earth, Her love alone made fair and worship-worth. For of a surety (and he showed his face, Wan-white with sickness, and his sunken eyes,) The life should linger in its weary place Small time after the new day's sun should rise, Unless her hand reknit the severed ties, That to his spirit only peace could give, And her lips' honey lent him strength to live. So he poured prayers into her listening ears; And all the while her hand in his he held, Bathing its ivory with the bitter tears, Which from his breast so thick and fiercely welled, That now and then to pause he was compelled; And as he ceased, upon her hand he poured Kisses more eloquent than any word. And for awhile it seemed to him, the strength Of his despair prevailed upon her soul; For her lids quivered and adown the length Of her soft cheek a silver tear did roll And a half sigh out of her bosom stole; And as upon her hand his lips he prest, He heard the heart throb loudly in her breast. Alas! his hope was all in vain. Full soon She drew her hand out from between his own And trembling, as one waking from a swoon, Conjured him, for God's sake, to get him gone And leave her quiet—else she were undone: For of a truth the day was near to break, And momently her husband might awake. “For in those ancient foolish days,” she said, “We were but girl and boy and in child-guise Did use to kiss and toy with each and played At love and courtship, for no harm might rise Of such child's sport: but now 'tis otherwise; For years have passed away since that befell And I am married, as thou knowest well. “And ill it should become me to the love Of any other man to give consent Than this my husband; wherefore, if there move Within thee any fear of God or saint, I do entreat thee now to be content With that which thou hast dared and done to night, And get thee gone before the day grow white. “For but consider what a cruel wrong Would fall on me through thine unmeasured heat, And how the harm to me would be life-long, If day should come and find thee at my feet. Now is my life happy and calm and sweet; For Paolo my husband loves me well, And in content and peace with him I dwell. “But if by evil chance he should awake And see thee kneeling thus by my bedside, He would leave loving me for thy rash sake And all my happy days with strife be tried; So that no more in peace I could abide With him,—even if no other harm ensue: Wherefore, I prithee, this I ask thee, do. “Or if the thought of ill to hap to me Avail not to avert thy wanton will, Bethink thee that no hope can ever be That any act of mine shall aye fulfil Thy mad desire or that there lingers still A spark of love for thee within my heart. Thanks thou shalt have, if but thou wilt depart.” (Ah me, what misery can equal his, Who loves and hears his dearest love confess, With that sweet voice that conjures back old bliss, The sad impeach of cold forgetfulness! I wot there is no pang of hell nor stress Of endless death, that can prevail above The wistfulness of unrequited love.) So knelt Girolamo, and listening To those cold words from that belovèd mouth, That did close up for him the gates of Spring And all the golden memories of youth, Knew all his hope in vain and felt the growth Of that cold bringer of the eternal rest Stir in the silent chambers of his breast. But even while he felt the chills of death Creep through his heart, he could not choose but take, (So strong is Love and such charm lingereth About the loved one's presence!) whilst she spake, Some sad delight. Even though his heart should break At her harsh words, the sweetness of her voice Could not but make his faithful soul rejoice. But when she ceased the music of her speech, The spell dissolved from him, and he awoke Unto his full despair nor did beseech Her any more nor strove again to evoke The phantom of dead love. The heavy stroke Was merciful and did benumb his brain, So that he thought no more to strive in vain. Nor did he find it in him to upbraid Her cruelty; but with a weary air And a sad voice, that might not be gainsaid, He did entreat of her one little prayer Of his to grant and lighten his despair;— That she would let him in the couch, beside Her body warm, a little while abide For all the heat had left him, with the chill Of the night-air;—and swore to her to lie Silent by her nor touch her, but quite still And mute to bide the while;—and presently, (He did avouch) before the day drew nigh, As soon as he regained a little heat, He would arise and go with noiseless feet. Then she,—some little moved by his despair And haply thinking thus the quicklier To be relieved of him,—unto his prayer Consented and did let him lie by her, Enjoining him to lie and never stir, And when as she should bid him go, that he Should rise and get him gone immediately. But he, his weary body being laid Within the bed, began to ponder o'er Within himself the things that she had said; And in his thought revolving all the sore Sad end of every pleasant thing of yore And all the grief that in his heart did lie, He presently resolved himself to die. So, with one last fond look at her sweet face, That lay beside him with averted eyes, And one last prayer to Mary full of grace And one last Ave intermixed with sighs, He folded up his hands to sleep, childwise, And by his dearly-loved Salvestra's side, He rendered up his gentle soul and died. So lay Girolamo the while the hours Slid onward through the cloisters of the dusk: And now the day began to put forth flowers, Pale buds of morning opening from the husk Of the small hours; and all the lights, that busk The cheerless heavens in the earliest dawn, Grew grey and chill across each upland lawn. And as the earliest dawn-streak in the East Began to glimmer through the casement's glass, Salvestra started from her fitful rest; And gradually, what had come to pass That night recalling to her mind, “Alas! The dusk is burning to the break of day,” She said, “and yet Girolamo doth stay!” Then did she chide him for his broken word And did conjure him rise without delay And get him gone. Yet not a whit he stirred, But dumb and motionless as death he lay And gave no heed to aught that she could say; Till she, supposing him with sleep opprest, Stretched out her hand and touched him on the breast. But lo! her passing hand aroused him not; And to her touch, as cold as any ice His bosom smote. A deadly terror got A sudden hold upon her. Twice or thrice She called him by his name. Then did she rise, And bending o'er him, felt no stir of breath Nor throb of pulse and knew that it was death. Then such a deathly fear laid hands on her And such an icy coldness of dismay, That for awhile she could nor speak nor stir; But by the dead all tremblingly she lay; Whilst through the clouds the grey and early day Crept from the casement to the dead man's place And threw a ghastly light upon his face. Then gradually the thoughts began to take Some form in her; and she was sore afraid Lest Paolo her husband should awake And find a lifeless man beside her laid; For much she feared lest he should her upbraid, Seeing the grisly sight would surely move The man to deem her faithless to his love. And in her thought awhile considering How she should best avert the blame she feared, At last she did resolve to tell the thing Unto her husband as a story heard In idle talk or else a chance occurred To other unknown folk, and so to know Whether the thing should anger him or no. Then, waking him, as if by accident, She did relate to him how, in a dream, So strange and sad a thing to her was sent, That still before her mind's eye it did seem To be presented, and (as she did deem) Till she had told him all, it would not cease To weary her or leave her any peace. Then, in ambiguous words (concealing nought Save name and place) the fatal circumstance Of all the ills to that sad loveling wrought By love, she told him,—how a youth did chance To love a maid, and being sent to France, After two years returned and found her wed,— And how, in his despair, beside her bed By night he knelt; and finding every prayer For love's renewal vain, did beg to be Allowed to warm himself from the cold air A little by her side. To which prayer she, Moved by his grief to pity, did agree; And how, when he had lain awhile and said No word, she had awoke and found him dead. And as she made an end of saying this, She prayed him he would tell her, of his mind, Whether the wife therein had done amiss, And what the husband, who awoke to find A stark dead man beside his wife reclined, Should do. Whereto he answered, that the man Must hold her blameless, since, as woman can, She had resisted all her lover's suit; But that, before the folk began to go About the ways, whilst yet the streets were mute, He should, to avert the evils that might grow From slanderous tongues—if any came to know The thing—take up the dead, and through the town Bearing him, in his doorway lay him down. Whereat Salvestra, being lightened much At heart to hear him speak his mind so fair And righteous, took his hand and made him touch Girolamo his bosom lying there Stark dead and cold; whereby he was aware She had made known to him, in other's name, Her own mischance. Yet not a word of blame To her he said, but rather comforted Her timorous soul and bade her have no care. Then, rising straight, he lifted up the dead And on his shoulders through the streets he bare Girolamo's sad body to the stair Before his mother's palace in the town And there all reverently he laid it down. Now, when the day was wakened with the sun And men began about the streets to go, One of the Countess' servants saw her son Lie as asleep within the portico, And touching him, to know if it were so, Found that the life from its sad seat had fled And told his mistress that her son was dead. Then she, for pride repressing her despair, Shed not a tear; but, with a pale set face, Commanded instantly that they should bear The body to the chief church of the place And set it by the Virgin's altar space, That there all due observances might be Filled, as behoved his rank and ancestry. So, with the majesty of funeral rites, They bore Girolamo unto the fane And there, amid a blaze of votive lights, They set his senseless body down again; And with full many a prayer and many a strain Of ceremonial song, they did commend His soul to God: nor did they make an end Of mourning him; but, as the manner is, When any noble dies, they did bewail His piteous death and loss of earthly bliss In earliest youth: and soon the sorry tale Of all his heavy fortune did not fail To stir among the people gathered there And move their hearts to pity his despair. Now, when the news was come to Paolo, Girolamo his body had been found, Most earnestly he did desire to know What talk might be among the folk around, And to what cause—seeing there was no wound Upon the man nor of disease a sign— His strange and sudden death they did assign. And to this end, Salvestra he enjoined To mingle with the women at the door, Within the church, and hear what tale was coined Among the folk, and thus herself assure That he had been unnoticed—when he bore The body home—of any citizen: And he would do the like among the men. The thing he bade was pleasing unto her, For (such a doubtful thing is woman's mind) The pity that his love had failed to stir Within her bosom, while the Fates were kind, Possessed her now; and she, that could not find A gentle word to gladden him alive, Felt for the dead the ancient love revive. So with a trembling step she bent her way Toward the church; and when afar she saw The dead man's face across the dense array, Love took revenge of his contemnèd law, “Amor ch'a null' amato amar perdona.”—Dante. And such invincible desire did draw Her feet unto the place where he was laid, She rested not until her way she made Athwart the crowd and stood beside the bier; Then, with a haggard eye considering The sad sweet face furrowed with many a tear And worn and wasted sore with sorrowing, The thought of his despair prevailed to bring To pass what all his life had failed to impart And Love gat hold upon her stubborn heart. Awhile she stood, with haggard straining eyes And hands that seemed to stretch toward the dead, As if to conjure back from Paradise The gentle soul from the sad body fled; Silent she stood, and not a tear she shed: But her face bent toward him more and more And her drooped knees sank slowly to the floor. At last her swelling bosom found a vent For all its weight of anguish and despair; And with a cry that all the silence rent And stirred the calling echoes far and near, She fell upon his bosom, lying there, And kissed the cold lips and the death-sealed eyes And called upon him madly to arise. For Death could surely have no power on him, Seeing she loved him with so fierce a heat; Her kiss should surely from the very rim Of the black night recall his wandering feet. But none the less the white face cold and sweet Lay passionless, the pale lips answered not And all her blandishments availed no jot. Then, gradually, seeing that in vain Her tardy kindness came, nor all love's stress Availed her to reknit life's severed skein, She did abate for very weariness Her idle strife and lay all motionless: But still with one long kiss her hot lips clave To his cold mouth that none in answer gave. And thus awhile she lay, her haggard face Pressed unto his that died for love of her, Whilst on the floor her locks did interlace With the full golden clusters of his hair. Long time she lay on him and did not stir; And on the air there hung a ghastly spell Of silence, measured by the tolling bell. At length, the pitying folk that stood around And wept for dolour of that piteous sight, Thinking Salvestra fallen of a swound, Would have uplifted from the marble white Her senseless form; but when they brought to light Her lovely face, they found the sweet soul fled And knew these lovers for waste love lay dead. So Death took pity on ill-fortuned love And at the last did grant these lovers twain That boon all other earthly bliss above, At rest beside each other to be lain And never stir from their embrace again. Ah Love! thou art full sweet; but never yet Did any man of thee such guerdon get. And there they buried them beneath the trees, Beside the running river, breast to breast, These two sad lovers. Ladies, if it please Your gentle hearts to hear of folk opprest Of love, I pray you use it softliest, This little song of mine, and say with me, God save all gentle souls that lovers be! Ah me! shall Love for ever suffer wrong? Shall none avail to stay the steps of Fate? Since Summer and its roses and the song Of choiring birds are powerless to abate The conquering curse, the uncompassionate; But all themselves must seek that frozen shore Where Spring and all its flowers have gone before. Alas! meseems there is none other thing Assured to us that work and watch and weep, Save only memory and sorrowing And the soft lapse into the eternal sleep! The harvest that we sow, what hands shall reap, What eyes shall see the glories that we dream, What ears shall throb unto the songs we deem, We know not; nor the end of love is sure, (Alack, how much less sure than anything!) Whether the little love-light shall endure In the clear eyes of her we loved in Spring, Or if the faint flowers of remembering Shall blow, we know not: only this we know,— Afar Death comes with silent steps and slow. Men lay their lives before the feet of Love, Strewing his way with many-coloured flowers, And poets use to set his praise above All other rulers of the days and hours: From age to age untold, recurrent showers Of psalm and song attest his empery And crown him God above all Gods that be. And with an equal breath, on that dark Lord, That rules the going out from life and light, The hate and fear of men have been outpoured, In words that borrowed blackness from the night; Nor have the singers spared with songs to smite His silent head, styling him bitterest foe Of that fair God that myrtle-crowned doth go. And yet, what Love could not prevail to do, Companied round with every goodly thought And every happy chance that men ensue, When all his charms of flowers and birdsongs wrought And all his sorceries availèd nought To give these lovers peace and twinned delight,— That Death wrought out of his unaided might. And thou, O best-belovèd of the sad, O Death, the angel of the end of tears! Let those heap blame on thee, whose lives are glad, For whom thy dwelling is the dusk of fears. I praise thee, that have loved thee many years: Though men revile thee, thou art dear to me: Sad is my song; I bring it all to thee. For me, I love thee not for lives beyond The compassed darkness of the accomplished Fate; I look not, I, with dazzled eyes and fond, To find new worlds behind thine iron gate; I love thee for thyself compassionate; I seek thee not for heavens and new life, Only for thine embrace that shuts out strife. I look not, I, for the awakening, After long sleep, in brighter worlds to come; I look but for the end of wearying, For pain to cease and sorrow to be dumb; To lay me down, with stricken sense and numb, Hiding my weary face within thy breast, Rest in thy bosom, and around thee rest. But you, my Masters, in whose mighty track I have ensued with slow and faltering feet, I will crave pardon of you, if I lack, In this my song, to follow on the beat Of your firm footsteps—if my errant heat Have, in the sad enchantment of my days, Put off the strong assurance of your lays. And first, glad Master, standing with one foot On earth and one foot in the Faery land— Whose song, with virgin Una taking root, Branches, a forest-tree majestic, spanned From earth through heaven unto the elfin strand— Thou that didst count the seasons and the hours With the fair forest calendar of flowers, That knew'st no sadness, building up thy song With love and life and deeds of high emprise, That rod'st with cheerful heart the world along, Counting to crown fair life with Paradise— I pray thee, Master fair and glad and wise, To pardon me, if none of these I seek; For I am sad, alas! and very weak. And thou, O star-browed singer—folded round With the vague awe of the Invisible, As with a cloak—whose radiant front is crowned With triple coronals ineffable, Attesting the assay of heaven and hell— Thou, whose aspèct indeed is very sad, Yet therewithin the hope of heaven had Burns like a glory and a shining fire— O pilgrim of the high celestial town, Forgive my weakling thought, if it aspire Not to the palm-branch and the starry crown, Only the soft rest and the lying down To dreamless sleep and cease of sorrowing; For I am weak and ask a little thing. A little thing, a narrow sorry hope! Indeed, a little thing to look upon, If one be glad and in the Future's scope Long vistas of fair places to be won And valorous deeds for doing follow on,— A weary hope, i'faith, if one be strong And run the race in gladness and with song. But, if the life be grief in any one And his despair shrink from the face of light, Fearing to see the splendour of the sun— If day for sadness wither in his sight And his tears fill the watches of the night, If love be madness and the hope of men Seem to his soul a mockery,—ah, then He cares not to renew the weariness Of unspent life within the years unknown; He shall not seek the never-ending stress Of the sad days for him immortal grown, A palace where his soul shall walk alone; His heart aspires but to the end of pain, The sleep where morning never comes again. And thus I hail thee, Lord of all my lays! Master and Healer, coming with soft wing! I lift my feeble voice unto thy praise, For thou to me art hope in every thing. Others have glory and remembering, Fair hope of future life and crown of faith, Love and delight; but I, I have but death. Wherefore I praise thee, seeing thou alone, Of all things underneath the heavens born, Art all assured. For is it not unknown Whether the glad sun on another morn Shall glitter or the Spring come to adorn Once more the woods and fields with winter pale? This but we know; thou Death shalt never fail. And unto thee I bring this weakling song, (For I am thine, and all my little skill) Wherein, alone among the busy throng, I have enforced me sadly to fulfil My meed of thanks to thee,—and loudlier still My growing voice shall praise thee, Death, than now, Lord of the Future, certain only thou! THORGERDA.Voices in the Air. THE night is riven from earth and heaven; The day is blue in the sweet sky-dome; The glad sea glimmers with soft sun-shimmers; The white sea-fairies float on the foam. The storm has faded from day new-braided With webs of azure above the seas: Shore-spirits, come, whilst the blast is dumb And the seaflowers sway in the fragrant breeze. I hear a ringing of sea-nymphs' singing, Far out to sea in the golden haze: Haste, sisters, haste, ere the noon have chased The cool-haired dawn from the sweet sea-ways. The air is golden; the storm is holden In sapphire chains of the sleepless stars: I see the flashing of mermaidens plashing And merrows glinting in sea-shell cars. Come swift, sweet sisters! Our witch-wife trysters Will soon in the distance fade and flee: Wide-winged we travel through the thin foam-ravel, To ride on the weed-weft mane of the sea.The Witch. LO! what a golden day it is! The glad sun rives the sapphire deeps Down to the dim pearl-floored abyss Where, cold in death, my lover sleeps; Crowns with soft fire his sea-drenched hair, Kisses with gold his lips death-pale, Lets down from heaven a golden stair, Whose steps methinks his soul doth scale. This is my treasure. White and sweet, He lies beneath my ardent eyne, With heart that never more shall beat, Nor lips press softly against mine. How like a dream it seems to me, The time when hand-in-hand we went By hill and valley, I and he, Lost in a trance of ravishment! I and my lover here that lies And sleeps the everlasting sleep, We walked whilere in Paradise; (Can it be true?) Our souls drank deep Together of Love's wonder-wine: We saw the golden days go by, Unheeding, for we were divine; Love had advanced us to the sky. And of that time no traces bin, Save the still shape that once did hold My lover's soul, that shone therein, As wine laughs in a vase of gold. Cold, cold he lies and answers not Unto my speech; his mouth is cold Whose kiss to mine was sweet and hot As sunshine to a marigold. And yet his pallid lips I press; I fold his neck in my embrace; I rain down kisses none the less Upon his unresponsive face: I call on him with all the fair Flower-names that blossom out of love; I knit sea-jewels in his hair; I weave fair coronals above The cold sweet silver of his brow; For this is all of him I have; Nor any future more than now Shall give me back what Love once gave. For from Death's gate our lives divide; His was the Galilean's faith: With those that serve the Crucified, He shared the chance of Life and Death. And so mine eyes shall never light Upon his star-soft eyes again; Nor ever in the day or night, By hill or valley, wood or plain, Our hands shall meet afresh. His voice Shall never with its silver tone The sadness of my soul rejoice, Nor his heart throb against mine own. His sight shall never unto me Return whilst heaven and earth remain: Though Time blend with Eternity, Our lives shall never meet again. Never by grey or purple sea, Never again in heavens of blue, Never in this old earth—ah me, Never, ah never! in the new. For he, he treads the windless ways Among the thick star-diamonds, Where in the middle æther blaze The golden City's pearl gate-fronds; Sitteth, palm-crowned and silver-shod, Where, in strange dwellings of the skies, The Christians to their Woman-God Cease nevermore from psalmodies. And I, I wait, with haggard eyes And face grown awful for desire, The coming of that fierce day's rise When from the cities of the fire The wolf shall come with blazing crest, And many a giant armed for war; When from the sanguine-streaming West, Hell-flaming, speedeth Naglfar. The enchanted ship, in which, according to the Norse mythology, the Jötuns, or giants, and the demons that dwell in Muspelheim (the land of fire) shall at the last day sail over sea and land, led by the Fenris-wolf and the Midgard serpent, to the assault of Asgard, the dwelling of the gods. I was a daughter of the race Of those old gods the Christians hurled From their high heaven-hilled dwelling-place, Gladsheimr, poised above the world. My mother was the fairest child The Norse-land knew, so strangely fair, The very gods looked down and smiled At her clear eyes and lucent hair. And Thor the Thunderer, enspelled By hunger of a god's desire For mortal love, came down, compelled And did possess her like a fire. And from the love of god and maid There was a child of wonder born, On whom the gods for guerdon laid Gifts goodlier than lands and corn. There was to her the queendom given O'er all the sprites of earth and sea, O'er every wind that rends the heaven, All lightnings through the clouds that flee. Gifts did they give to her for flight Athwart the crystal waves of air, To cleave the billows green and white And float among the sea-nymphs fair. Her eyes pierced all the veils of mist And all the crannies of the sea; There was no hill-cave but she wist To master all its mystery. And since she was the last of all The godlike race upon the earth That could endure the Christian's thrall, Being so mingled in her birth, A spell was laid upon her life, A charm of thunder and of fire, That she should wage an endless strife, For Thor the Thunderer's sake, her sire, With that pale god, the Nazarene, And all his servants on the earth, Smite all their days with dole and teen And waste their every work with dearth; For that alone by sea and land She should do battle for the gods And for the Æsir Æsir, the Northern gods, so called from their supposed Asian origin. champion stand, Far banished from the green Norse sods. That child was I, Thorgerda hight For memory of my mighty sire, The last one of those maids of might That ruled the fiends of air and fire. I am the old gods' sword-bearer: Upon this world of life and death, Alone against the Christ I rear The standard of the ancient faith: I am their champion, that do wage Unending and remorseless war Against the new and barren age That knows not Odin, no, nor Thor. I am the witch of Norroway, The sorceress that rides the blast, That sends the whirlwind on its way To rend the sail and snap the mast. By day and night, by sea and land, I wreak on men unnumbered ills; I hurl the thunder from my hand, I pour the torrent from the hills. I stand upon the height of heaven And smite the world with pestilence; The Christ and his Archangels seven Cannot prevail against me thence. But more especially the night Is given to me to work my will: Therein, with ravening delight, Of ruin red I take my fill. When as the sun across the wave Has drawn the colour from the sky And over all the dead day's grave The grisly night mounts wide and high, My heart throbs loud, my wings expand, I rush, I soar into the air And falcon-like, o'er sea and land, Valley and hill, I fly and fare. I hover o'er the haunts of men, Above the white town-dotted coasts, The hollow, moon-bemaddened glen, Brimmed with the bodiless grey ghosts. I scatter curses far and near, I fill the air with deaths that fly: The pale folk tremble as they hear My rushing wings that hurtle by. And often, when the world is white Beneath the moon and all things sleep, I wake the storm-fiends in the night And loose the whirlwind o'er the deep. I sink the great ships on the sea, I grip the seamen by the hair And drag them strangling down with me To drown among the corals rare. I bid the volleying thunders roar, The lightnings leap, the rushing rain Swell up the sea against the shore, To overwhelm the fated plain. I stand upon the hills and hurl The crashing thunderbolts afar, Until the wild waves in their swirl Blot out the sight of moon and star. I slay the cattle in the stall, I smite the sheep upon the fells; The great pines in the forest fall, Stricken and blasted by my spells. The Christians call upon their God, That cannot ward them from my power: No living thing dares stir abroad When as I rule the midnight hour. No man that meets me in the night, But he is numbered with the dead: The world until the morning light Is given to me for death and dread. But, when the break of morning-grey The cloudwrack in the east divides And wan and woeful comes the day, The tempest in my soul subsides; And weary with the night's turmoil, I seek some middle mountain cave, Where sleep falls down on me like oil Poured out upon the whirling wave. Or else I cleave the glancing glass Of the still sea and through the deep Down to some sea-nymph's grotto pass, Whereas the quiet corals sleep, Unheeding if the sky is blue Or if the storm in heaven is seen: No whisper of the wind sinks through The ceiling of that deep serene. Sometimes, when heaven, frowning-browed, Hangs o'er the earth, a leaden dòme, I cleave the canopy of cloud And in the middle æther roam; Seeking some token of my race, Some sign to fill my void desire, So haply I may see the face Of Odin or my dreadful sire. But vast and void the æther lies; My wings arouse no echo there, Nor my songs, ringing through the skies, Evoke an answer from the air. Blank is the world: there seems no sign Of all that was; the days forget The gods that drank the wonder-wine Of Freya's Freya, the Northern Venus, who prepared from grapes or apples the drink that gave the gods eternal youth.) grapes whilere. And yet, Behind the setting, now and then, I see a crown of flame and smoke Burn up above the fiery fen Wherein, until the sable cloak Of Time from sea and land be torn And the Gods' Twilight Ragnärok, the end of the world. fill the sky, The Jötuns 'gainst the battle-morn Forge weapons everlastingly. And in my journeyings through the night Across the billows' rushing race, Midmost the main, far out of sight Of land, I come upon a place Where in mid-ocean, storm-possest, When with the sky the stern sea wars, The Snake The Midgard-serpent, that lies coiled around the world. lifts up his horrid crest And hisses to the pallid stars. Bytimes, too, as cold-eyed I sail Across the wastes of middle air, A blithe breeze wafts aside the veil Of clouds heaped up and floating there; And dimly through the rift of blue Turrets and hill-peaks I discern And for a space behold anew The golden gates of Asgard burn. And as the vision grows, meseems Valhalla rises grey and wide; And dim and vast as thunder-dreams, The old gods gather side by side. Upon his throne of elfin gold Allfather Odin sits: his beard Streams o'er his bosom, fold on fold, Like mosses on an oak bolt-seared. And all the gods around him stand, Forset, Frey, Balder—ay, the dead Joined to the live, an awful band: And in the midst, with drooping head, The semblance of my mighty sire, Leant on his hammer, stands apart, His sunk eyes gleaming like the fire That glows within some mountain's heart. A golden glimmer cleaves the gloom; And momently, as if there rose The sun upon some giant's tomb, The haloed hair of Freya glows. On Odin's breast she lies and sleeps, Whilst, to his left and to his right, A Valkyr armed the wild watch keeps, By Friga, sitting stern and white. Anon a Raven Odin was fabled to have two Ravens, Thought and Memory, who brought him tidings of all that went on in the world. stirs and shakes His sable wings athwart the hall; And for a second Freya wakes, And in their sleep the gods stir all: And Thor lifts up his sunken head And poises in his shadowy hand His awful hammer; then, outspread, Sleep falls again upon the band. The Raven folds his wings anew; The gleam of Freya's hair fades out; And suddenly as first they drew, The clinging cloud-wreaths fold about The City of the seven-peaked Hill. But I am glad for many a year: For I have seen the gods live still And looked on Thor the Thunderer. And yet but seldom now the gods Bow down unto my long desire: But seldom in the sunset nods Odin or Asa-Thor The Asian Thor, the special title of the Thunder-god. my sire Strides on before me through the din Of thunders in the midnight wild; Nor on the hills the Nornas Nornas, the Northern Fates. spin: The gods are angry with their child. Thor hides his visage from his maid, For that, some little space whilere Of days and nights, aside she laid Her mission terrible and fair And stooped to love as women love, But fiercelier far than woman can, The eagle pairing with the dove, The heaven-born mating with a man. It chanced, one summer's night of blue, When only stars in heaven were And like a rain of pearls, the dew Slid through the golden August air, My wings had borne me from the sea To where the curving down sloped slow Into a cirque of lilied lea, Whereon sheep wandered to and fro. Laid in the lap of cliff and hill, The velvet down seemed fast asleep, Save for the murmur of a rill That trickled past the browsing sheep. And now and then the herd-bells broke The sleep of sound; and faint and far, The ripple of the sea-surge woke A languid echo. Not a star Twinkled; but, in the drowsy dream Of hill and down, it was as if No storm was aye; and it did seem No breakers roared behind the cliff. The charm of peace that brooded there Weighed on my wings; and wearywise I floated on the quiet air, Under the dreaming evening skies. For momently the fierce delight Of storm and vengeance died in me; And some desire rose in my spright Of rest and peace in days to be. I was aweary of long strife: The passion of my awful sire, That had informed my lonely life To wreak on men his dread desire, Seemed weakening in me; and instead, The earthly part in me arose, Like to some fire that shows its head Of flame above the boreal snows: And as the keen heat melts the ice And drives the winter-woe away, So in my heart's fierce fortalice Awhile the woman's wish held sway. The godlike part in me awhile Fainted; and in my woman's breast The memory of my mother's smile The empty place of hate possessed. And many a longing, vague and sweet, Welled up like fountains in the Spring: My heart glowed with a human heat And in my thought new hopes took wing. Wish woke in me to put away The wonted stress of doom and power, That gave me empire o'er the day And night in every changing hour And made my soul a scathing fire, An immortality of death; And therewithal the soft desire To breathe the kindly human breath, To know the charm in life that lies, To be no longer curst and lone, To meet the glance of kindred eyes And feel warm lips upon my own. And as I wavered, half aswoon With anguish of unformed desire, The silver presence of the moon Rose in the silence. High and higher Into the quiet sky she soared; And as she lit the tranquil sheep And the pale plain, upon the sward I saw the shepherd lie asleep. Upon a little knoll he lay, With face upturned toward the sky, Bareheaded; and the breeze at play Stirred in his hair caressingly. The sudden sight to me did seem The clear fulfilment of my thought, As if at ending of a dream The half-seen hope to shape were wrought And day informed the wish of night: For he was young and passing fair, A very angel of delight. With sleep-sealed eyes and floating hair. And as I gazed upon him, lo! The fierceness of the first love smote The age-old ice in me with throe On throe of passion: I forgot My destiny in that sweet hour, And all my birth had doomed me to, Allfather Odin and his power. The stars stood in that night of blue And spoke of nought but hope fulfilled And sweets of life with life new knit: And through their glamour grave and stilled, Love spoke and bade me worship it. I could but yield: the hot blood welled Like balms of fire through heart and brain: My every motion seemed compelled To some strange ecstasy of pain, So sharp and sweet the new wish was: And as it grew, my tired wings closed And down I sank upon the grass, Hard by the place where he reposed. Then, drunken with a fearful bliss, I clasped my arms about his breast And in the passion of a kiss, My lips upon his lips I press'd. The hot touch burnt me like a flame: And he with a great start awoke And (for sleep still his sense did claim And the dream held him) would have broke The prison of my clasping arms: But could not, for aloud I cried The softest, sweetest of my charms; And as I chanted, white and wide, My glad wings opened and I rose Into the middle midnight air, Like some night-hawk that homeward goes, Bearing a culver to its lair. The breeze sang past me, as I clave The crystals of the sky serene; And presently the plashing wave Sounded, and past the marge of green The long blue lapses of the main Swept to the dawnward, and the foam Slid up and fled and rose again, Like white birds wheeling in the gloam. Down through the deeps of yielding blue I plunged with that fair youth I bore, Harmless, until we sank unto Where through the dusk the golden floor And pearl-hung ceiling of a cave Opened upon the sombre sea: But by my charms the whirling wave Drew back and left the entry free. Therein upon a bank of sand, Bordered with corals white and red I laid my lover. Cold his hand Was and his face cold as the dead And the lids fallen upon his eyes: But soon my sorceries had drawn The life back; and like some sweet skies That break blue underneath the dawn, His clear eyes opened on mine own; The life-blood gathered in his cheek, And gradually his fair face shone And his lips moved as if to speak: For at the first he saw me not; But his eyes moved from side to side Of that pearl-floored and golden grot, As if with wonder stupefied. Then, as they rested on my place, At first, the pallor of affright Drew all the rose-blush from his face And made its brilliance marble-white. But, soon, assured that I was fair, (For of a truth new-born desire Had bathed my beauty in a rare Splendour as of ethereal fire) A slow smile, gathering on his lips, Broke into brightness, as the sun, After some quickly-past eclipse, Grows golden through the darkness dun. His blue eyes glittered with soft light And on his forehead's lambent snow, The angel of a new delight Brooded with pinions all aglow. The passion in my veins that burned Passed to his own like magic wine: He raised himself with mouth that yearned And eyes that fastened upon mine. Then, as insensibly I drew Nearer to him, moved by the spell, About my neck his arms he threw And on each other's breast we fell. The dawn aroused me. To the dome Of purple sea, that ceiled our cave, The lances of the light struck home Across the emerald-hearted wave. Through weed and pearl the sheer sun smote And turned the gloom of middle sea To liquid amber, mote on mote, Threading the air with jewelry. And as the many-coloured rays Played on his face, I leant my head Upon my hand and fed my gaze Upon my lover's goodlihead. Long, long I gazed on him, entranced With wonderment of dear delight, Until the frolic motes, that glanced Across his eyelids, waxed so bright That needs his sleep must yield to it. His fair face quivered, and his hand Drew out of mine that folded it. And then, as if some soft wind fanned The petals of a flower apart, That in their snowy bell confine The dewy azure of its heart, His blue eyes opened full on mine. Once more the look of wonderment Rose in their depths; but, ere it grew Fulfilled, its faint beginning blent Into a sun-sweet smile that knew No thought save of perfected love And happiness too sweet for speech; And in that greeting our hands clove And our lips grew each unto each. Voices in the Air. We are glad for the golden birth of the noon; We are filled with the fragrant breath of the breeze: The Day-god walks on the woof of the seas; The green deeps laugh to his shining shoon; And far in the fair sea-shadow the tune Of harps and singings flutters and flees: The sea-nymphs call us to follow soon, To revel with them in the liquid leas. All hail, sweet singers! We follow fast; We follow to float on the white wave-run. We stay but to finish the spells begun, To rivet the chains of the bounden blast, To seal the storm in the sea-caves vast With the last few charms that are yet undone: Then hey! for the plains where the whale sails past And the white sea-nixes sport in the sun. All hail! the sweet of the day is ours; Our wings are wet with the salt of the sea. Our task is over, our feet are free To fare where the foam-bells shiver in showers And the seaweeds glitter with glory of flowers. The lines of the land do faint and flee: We come to the heart of the mid-sea bowers, On the race of the running billows' glee. What power shall let us? Our lives are light; Our hearts beat high with the laugh of the day. We have sundered our souls from the dawning grey; We have done with the dream of the darksome night; We have set our face to the foam-line white, To dream in the nooning the hours away, Where the sea-swell heaves and the spray is bright And the petrels wheel in the mid sea-way. The Witch. My life put on from that sweet hour Another nature: thence, no more I thought to wield my baleful power Nor treasures of my dreadful lore. There was no magic now for me In stirring up the stormy strife 'Twixt heaven and earth and air and sea: The memory lapsed from out my life Of my dread mission: faded out Was all my passion of wild hate, My wrath ancestral, like a rout Of dreams the sunbeams dissipate. And I forgot the fearsome spell That sealed my god-born life erewhen With all the powers of hate and hell To wreak the Æsir's curse on men. The vengeance of the gods unseen, Whilom with such a fiery smart Kindled against the Nazarene, No longer rankled in my heart. The old gods died out of my thought, As though in me they had no share: The change Love had within me wrought Blotted the past-time from my air. No more I roamed the affrighted night, Smiting the haunts of men with death: The hamlets stood, unharmed and white, Unblasted of my burning breath. No curses slew the wandering folk Belated on the wild sea-moors: No pines beneath the thunderstroke Crashed down among the trembling boors. The sea slept calm beneath the sun: No spells of mine across the sky Unloosed the storm-clouds red and dun Or hurled the thunders far and nigh. But full and still the sunlight lay Across the lapse of sea and land; Save for the dancing ripples' play, No surges thundered on the sand. Love had transformed me: now I knew None but his strife, no other bliss Than in my lover's eyes of blue To watch the coming of a kiss. For him, I was an ocean-nymph, One of the sweet fantastic kind, That sport beneath the emerald lymph And in their hair sea-corals wind. Nought could his boyish wisdom read Of my weird past within mine eyes: For aye with happy love indeed They bathed in dreams of Paradise. And over all my haughty face The glamour of the time had shed A tender glow of timid grace. The splendour of revengeful dread, That once had marked me, was subdued Into a glory faint and fair, That rayed out from my softer mood, Like sunshine in the April air. All day within our cave we slept; And when the sunset's scarlet shoon Over the happy heaven swept And in the faint-hued sky the moon Mounted,—across the quiet land, By hill and valley, wood and dale, We wandered often, hand-in-hand, Under the silver splendours pale. And often, seated side by side, Lost in each other's deep of eyes, Insensibly the night would glide Till morning glittered in the skies. For nothing but our love we knew In earth and air, in sky and sea; No heaven to my gaze was blue As that within his eyes for me. I could not tire of his fair sight: Whenever on his face I fed My eyes, the first supreme delight Relived in all its goodlihead. And ever, when from sleep I woke And saw him lying by my side, The same sweet wonder on me broke As when his beauty first I spied. Ah me, how fair he was! Meseems, Since God made heaven and earth and air, He hath not in His wildest dreams Made any creature half so fair. About his forehead's lambent pearl, Blushed with the rose-tints of a shell, The gold locks clustered, curl on curl, Like daffodils about the bell Of some fair haughty lily-cup, That in the marges of a wood Lifts its broad snowy bosom up And tempts the bees to light and brood. And in its eyebrow's arching lines Each deep-blue eye seemed, as it were, A tarn dropped in a curve of pines, Upon some snow-white mountain-stair. No fruit was ever yet so sweet As his sweet mouth, where day and night For me failed never from his seat The angel of fulfilled delight. No sunlight glittered like the smile That blossomed from his flower-cup lips; Whereat my thirsty soul the while Did hover, as a bee that sips. No snows of silver could compare With the white splendour of his breast: Whilst that my head lay pillowed there, No angel knew a sweeter rest. His face to me was as a sun That smote the winter-thoughts apart, Scattering old memories every one, And made new Springtime in my heart. Love had brought back the age of gold: For me, a new and fairer birth Had made me radiant, as of old Ask Ask and Embla, the Northern Adam and Eve. in the Paradisal earth. It was as if a veil were drawn That long had lain before my eyes: Each hour upon my sense did dawn Some splendour new in earth and skies. The pageants of the sundown burst, A new delight, upon my sense: And night was radiant as the first That fell on Embla's Ask and Embla, the Northern Adam and Eve. innocence. The primrose-blooms of daybreak came, A new enchantment, to my soul: And noontide, with its flowers of flame, Like philters on my passion stole. Till that sweet time, the silver Spring Had come and gone without my heed: Nor with its flush of blossoming, A glory fallen on hill and mead, The royal Summer had prevailed To stir the frost-time in my breast: Nor yet the Autumn crimson-mailed: Winter alone my heart possess'd. But now each change of land and sea, Each cloud that glittered in the sky, Each flower that opened on the lea, Each calling bird that flitted by, Woke in my breast a new concent Of deep delicious harmony: My soul was grown a lute that blent Its note with all sweet sounds that be. My heart was grown a singing fire That with each hour a new sweet strain Mixed with the many-mingling choir Of birds and flowers, of sea and plain. My memory fails to count the lapse Of time that held our happiness: So full a mist of glory wraps Its golden hours and such a stress Of splendour folds it, that meseems It might have been as time appears, That in the dim delight of dreams Holds in an hour a thousand years. For all things yield to love fulfilled: To those that walk in Paradise, The falling feet of Time are stilled; They know not if he creeps or flies. A moment to their spreading bliss May pass a century away; Or in the passion of a kiss A thousand years be as a day. Ah me! though I remembered not The seal my birth on me had set, The wrath of Him that me begot And the old gods did not forget. For evermore some omen sent A thrill of anguish through my soul: Some levin through the clear sky rent; Thor on the mountain-tops did roll. And now and then, on our delight, Across the amber wave would fall The shadow of a raven's flight: The great gods on their child did call In wailing voices of the storm; And in the sunset's gold and red, Methought I saw the Thunderer's form Grow in the gloaming, dim and dread. But no sign rankled in my mind: Love so possessed my heart and brain, All else was but an idle wind, A passing breath of summer rain. One night, when not a zephyr's breath Broke on the deep delicious swoon Of hill and plain, and still as death, The white world slept beneath the moon, We tracked the quiet stream, that made Its silver furrow through the strand, And fell into the sea that played, Lapping, upon the curving sand, Up through wild wood and fern-grown fell To where,—a silver thread across The weeded pebbles,—like a bell, Its fountain tinkled through the moss. And parting back the lush sweet growth Of waterweeds,—that there did cling, As if the rivulet were loath To yield the secret of its spring,— We climbed through reed and fern and found Where at the last the young stream shot Its spire of silver from the ground, Midmost a virgin forest-grot. The clustered clematis hung there, Trailed curtain-like the place before, As if some wood-nymph with her hair Had made the grot a fairy door: And through the tangle wild and sweet Of woodbind and convolvulus, The silver streamlet, in a sheet Of crystal multitudinous, Poured arched above the entering, And curving down across the roof, Along the pearly floor did sing, Threading athwart a tangled woof Of moss and stonecrop, till it slid Into a cranny of the stone, Wherein it seemed the Naïad hid, On green of leafage laid alone. The place was sweet with jasmine-breath: Across the silver-spangled grail, Starred with blue blossoms, wreath on wreath, Pervinck and saxifrage did trail: And in the ultimate recess A crowding growth of fragrant thyme Had made a couch, such as might press Some huntress-maid of olden rhyme. The falling fountain of the stream Alone the charmèd silence broke, Like bell-chimes hearkened in a dream, Unknowing if one slept or woke. The drowsy sweetness of the place Stole on our sense; and we, content, Gave up ourselves unto that grace And mingling charm of sound and scent. Reclined upon that fragrant bed, We lay embraced, perceiving not Aught but the spell of slumber shed From all that sleep-enchanted grot. And soon the tinkle of the spring And the soft cloud of woodland scents, That in the dreamy air did cling, Laid hands of balm upon our sense And sleep fell down upon our eyes, As softly and unconsciously As noontide from the August skies Falls on the ripple of the sea. He first did yield him to the charms Of that sweet sleep and I awhile Lay gazing on him till my arms Relaxed and in my thought his smile Blent with a dream of summer days; And his face seemed to me a flower That from the marging woodland ways Burns in the golden noontide hour. And so sleep fell upon me too; The grot died out before my sight: But yet the stream-song did pursue My slumbrous senses, like some light Chime of sweet bells in Faërie, Threading upon a silver string Of mingling dreams its rosary Of pearls. But, as the crystal ring Murmured unceasing in my ear, Dulled with the dream, meseemed it grew Slowly less sweet, less silver-clear: A change across my spirit drew; And gradually,—as with those Upon whose head slow water drops, Unceasing, till the soft fall grows An anguish horrible, that stops The pulse of life,—so in my brain The ceaseless sound of that soft stream Waxed to a terror and a pain Within the chambers of the dream. Methought at first it was a knell That sounded for Love's funeral: And then, again, its tinkle fell Like storm-waves on a cavern wall: But ever loudlier; until It was the distant-seeming roar Of thunder, over wood and hill Growing and nearing evermore. Louder and nearer still it came, Until meseemed above my head The bolts broke and the lightning's flame Tore up the heaven with rifts of red. And in the dream I heard the car Of Thor across the hill-tops roll, Shaking to ruin every star: The world trembled from pole to pole With that fierce clamour and the air Rang with the startled nightbirds' cries. And as I lay and listened there, The Thunderer hurled across the skies His awful hammer. Swift and straight, Meseemed, it clove the screaming heaven, Ruddy as flame, and fierce as fate, Full at my lover's brow was driven. Down at my very feet it fell, Flaming, and cleft the quaking ground Down to the immost heart of hell: And from the rift, a roaring sound Of fires innumerous burst into The midnight air: the very core Of the abysmal world shone blue And awful. Then again a roar Of thunders unendurable The cloisters of the æther broke, So terrible that the dream-spell Was cloven in twain and I awoke. The grot was still, save for the sound Of waters whispering through the air; The moonlight lay along the ground And lit my lover sleeping there. The terror of the dream possess'd My waking sense: with fearful ear I listened, half affrighted lest Some horror should be drawing near. But not a breath the stillness clave: The wind was silent: even the sea Bore not thus far its rippling wave And the birds slept on bush and tree. Perfected peace held everything; And yet there lingered in my head The terror of remembering: A cold sweat over me was shed And my heart fainted in my breast: I could not conquer with my will The tremors that upon me press'd, The thrill of thunders echoing still. Some fearful presence seemed to brood Above the place. Its every nook Was lit with moonlight: yet I could Awhile not lift my head to look. At last, moved by some hidden spell, I raised my eyes from off the floor; And where the middle moonlight fell, I saw a shadow in the door. I could nor speak nor move for fear: I could but gaze; and as I gazed, The shadow darkened and drew near, And from its depths two great eyes blazed Like fiery stars. Darker it grew And taller, till the cave was filled With the weird presence and I knew The awful shape of him that killed Skadnir; A Norse Titan, who scaled Asgard and was slain by Thor. for now the dusk had ta'en Terror and beauty; and before My shrinking sight there stood again The figure of the Thunderer Thor, Leant on his hammer. Not a word Came from the god's lips; but his eyes Blazed like a bale-fire. On the ground I crouched before him, suppliant-wise, With hands outstretched in silent dread: For in the terror of his look The anger of the gods I read, As in some judgment-angel's book. But still his eyes of changeless flame Burnt on mine own; and as they shot Their splendours on me, a strange shame Rose in me, for that I forgot The great gods banished from the earth, The anguish of my mighty sire And all the passion of my birth, To follow forth a weak desire. And as I looked upon him, still The fulgent glory of his gaze My every vein and thought did thrill With memories of the olden days. Before their searching light meseemed The earthly part fled forth from me; And it was but as if I dreamed Love and its human ecstasy. The woman's weakness of desire Forsook my brain; and in its stead, The old divine revengeful fire Rose up within me, fierce and red. Once more the wild wrath in me burned, The passion of ancestral rage, And once again my spirit yearned To loose the storm-winds from their cage, To cleave the quiet air with doom, To ride the thunder through the sky, To chase the Christians to the tomb With lightnings darting far and nigh. Then, as I rose, dreadful and fair With that new fearfulness of birth, The Thunder-god waxed brighter there, Until it seemed the cowering earth Trembled beneath his flaming sight. To me he beckoned, and I grew In stature to my godlike height; And still my steps to him he drew. And as I strode out of the grot And stood beneath the quiet moon, Behold, I looked and saw him not: But in the sky, rune upon rune, The stars, in characters of blood Shone like a scroll of fate and fear: And as possessèd there I stood, I heard the thunder drawing near. Then, like some fierce volcanic sea, The weird possession of my race Rose, myriad-minded, up in me. One after one, like hawks that chase Each other through the quivering air, The spells, that startle from their rest The tempest-demons in their lair, Burst up, tumultuous, from my breast. And as they winged it south and north, The thunder broke across the sky: The snakes of doom shot hissing forth, Crested with bale-fires blue and high. And from the rifted clouds, that shone Livid with sulphur-flames, there fell Rain, hail and many a blazing stone, As though to the sheer heaven hell Had leapt, and surging o'er the world, Like to a canopy of doom, Upon the cowering valleys hurled The fires and furies of its womb. Then my wings spread out wide and white; And through the turmoil I had made, Drunk with wild wrath, into the night I mounted. Many a meteor played, Crown-like, about my haughty head: And as across the sky I swept, Like serpents following where I led, About my path the lightnings leapt. From every corner of the sky I heard the rush of flaming wings: The fiends across the world did fly And the air teemed with fearful things. All demons in the earth that dwell Or in the caverns of the sea Gathered: the grisly ghouls of hell And all the monstrous shapes that be Within the air and in the fire Flocked to my call, to wreak on men The deadly passion of my sire And the old gods: and now and then, As, on the pinions of the wind, Among the dragons I did stride, With hair that flamed out far behind, Methought I saw the Valkyrs ride. And I the while chanted aloud My sternest sorceries and hurled My deadliest charms abroad and strowed A rain of ruin on the world. Each word I sang, each sign I made Was fraught with terror and affright. Obedient, the levins rayed, The hailstones hurtled through the night. A flood of fierce destruction rained Upon the terror-stricken earth: The hosts of hell were all unchained, To whelm the world with death and dearth. The ocean burst its age-old bounds And rushed upon the shuddering shore: As 'twere a herd of demon-hounds, The whirling waves did leap and roar. And soon no limit marked the place Where the sea was and where the plain; But over all the prospect's face The raging waters spread amain. And so all night I rode the blast; And all night long, spell upon spell, Rang, trumpet-sounded, fierce and fast, My summons to the host of hell. Until across the lurid gloom A streak of wavering white was drawn And like a grey ghost from the tomb, Arose the pale phantasmal dawn. Then from the world my sorcery ceased; The demons vanished to the dead; And at the token in the East, The sullen ocean sought its bed. Into the night the thunders died, With wailing echoes o'er the hills; And all the snakes of lightning vied In flight before the morning's sills. And then the pallid sun arose, Ghastly with horror: like a flame On funerals its light that throws, Across the wasted world it came. Beneath its rays the earth spread cold And stark as in the swoon of death: The flocks lay dead upon the wold, The cattle lifeless on the heath. The homesteads lay in ruined heaps Or stood a void of sea-stained stone; Save where upon the mountain-steeps Some bolt-seared castle rose alone. And everywhere the folk lay dead, Mother by daughter, sire by son: No live thing seemed to lift its head Under the epicedial sun. Save where, perchance, a shivering group Of peasants on some lofty crest, Whither for safety they did troop, Each against each in terror press'd. No bird-songs hailed the hopeless morn: The thrush sat dead upon the tree; The lark lay drowned among the corn, The cuckoo blasted on the lea. The forests lay in tangled lines, Smitten against the ravaged ground; And out to sea, great rooted pines Whirled in the eddies round and round. Upon its seething breast, as 'twere The trophies of that night of fear. The hollow-sounding ocean bare The drowned folk floating far and near. Upon the waves their lank hair streamed Like weeds; and in their open eyes, As on the surge they rocked, meseemed I saw the dreams of death arise. Above the wrack of death and dread I floated—like some bird of prey, Worn with long rapine—in the dead And stillness of the growing day. And in my heart the fierce delight Of ruin and destruction waned; The drunken madness of the night Ebbed; and but weariness remained. Landward my tired wings carried me, Following the rill, that now no more, A silver ribbon, joined the sea, But swollen into a torrent's roar, Swept raging o'er its rocky bed: And as I floated, knowing not Whither, I saw that chance had led My pinions to the river-grot. All bare it lay: the raging wave Had stripped the creepers from the stone, And in the opening of the cave The rocky pillars overthrown. The silver singing fountain-thread Trickled no longer from the door, An arching crystal: in its stead, A foaming flood of water tore The clinging clematises' woof. The place lay open to the sky; For in the storm the rocky roof Was cloven and scattered far and nigh. And as I looked upon the waste Of what had been so fair a place, With all its beauty now erased, The memory of my lover's face Smote on my spirit suddenly; And in that flash of backward thought, Remembrance startled up in me Of all the change the night had wrought. The anguish of past love again Revived in me; and mad with fear And love foreboding, I was fain To call upon him, loud and clear. Across the air my shrill cries rang; But no voice answered to mine own: Only the calling echoes' clang Rose up and died from rock and stone. Again I called him by his name; And still across the quivering air The hollow-sounding echoes came, For sole response to my despair. Then, dazed with agonized affright, I plunged into the surging wave, That filled up to its utmost height The hollow bosom of the cave; And in the water-darkened grot, With trembling hands and pallid face, Madly I sought but long found not My lover in that mournful place. At last, as in the dusk I groped— Probing each innermost recess, To find I scarce knew what I hoped Or feared—a floating tangled tress Caught in my hands, as 'twere a weed That in its flight the water bare: But as I looked, I saw indeed It was my lover's golden hair. Then, diving through the pool of foam, I saw, upon a mossy bed That wavered in the watery gloam, Where lay my darling drowned and dead. Dead by my hand! In my embrace I caught his cold form hard and close; And spurning back the water's race, Up to the outer air I rose. And with all swiftness of my flight, Across the desolated plain I bore him, lying still and white, Unto my cave beneath the main. There, as the 'reavèd lioness Moans, raging, o'er her stricken young, Long days and nights my arms did press The dead and on his neck I hung. And all my sorceries I essayed, If haply some imperious spell The gentle spirit might persuade Again in that fair form to dwell. And many a fierce and forceful prayer Unto the gods I cried and said, That for my service and despair They would but give me back my dead. But every charm was all in vain And to my prayers no answer came: Only above the rippling main Murmured in mockery, aye the same. At last, worn weary of my life, For uselessness of prayer and spell, I did forsake the empty strife 'Gainst death and on the nymphs, that dwell In every coral-wroughten cave And every pearl and golden hall That lies beneath the whirling wave, With one last effort I did call. Then came they and with hallowing hands Bathed him in savours of the sea, Bound his fair breast with silken bands Made potent with strange balsamry. And many a sweet and secret verse And many a rude and antick rhyme— Fraught with a spell—they did rehearse About the dead, so—till the time When like the flaming of a scroll The heaven and earth shall pass away— His perfect body fair and whole Should know no vestige of decay. Since then, the gods have seized again Their full imperial sway on me: For evermore, in heart and brain, I am their maid by land and sea: I am their servant day and night To work on men their wrathful will, To stand their champion in the fight Against the Nazarene, until That unimaginable day, When in the throes of death and birth The olden gods shall pass away; When from the sea a new green earth Shall rise, where in a glorious band, Transfigured and regenerate, The new-born heavenly ones shall stand Before a new Valhalla's gate: When I, content with ended strife, Shall with my glorious kindred die, Haply to live with a new life In a new Asgard of the sky. But lo! the night draws on apace; The sun is sunken in the west; And in the clouds meseems I trace The scarlet-burning Serpent's crest, Hurled up against the heaven. The flame Of the gods' wrath burns up in me; And through my veins a searching shame Surges and will not let me free. The maddening memory of my fall, From the gods' service to the deep Of woman's weakness, in the gall Of bitterness my soul doth steep. And as I overpass in thought The time when I awhile resigned Myself to love, my heart is wrought To rage and wrath o'erwhelms my mind. The bygone love for one man turns To hate against the world of men; Within my soul the old fire burns, The thirst for ruin swells again. Across the gathering gloom of sky The dun clouds mass; and back and forth See where the calling ravens fly, East unto west and south to north. And lo! where in the sunset cloud, Red as a sacrificial fire, The form of Odin, thunder-browed, Beckons unto my dread desire. I know those signs: the old gods call Upon their daughter to arise From sloth and on the storm-wind's spall, To ride the tempest through the skies. The thunder wakens: Odin nods And the sky blackens o'er the main: My wings spread out: I come, great gods! Your maid is wholly yours again. Voices in the Air. The soft skies darken; The night draws near; I lie and hearken; For in my ear The land breeze rustles across the mere; The corby croons on the haunted brere. The sea has shrouded The dying sun; The air is clouded With mist-wreaths dun: The gold lights flicker out one by one: The day is ended, the night begun. The pale stars glisten; The moon comes not: I lie and listen I know not what: Meseems the breath of the air is hot, As though some levin across it shot. The petrels flutter Along the breeze; A moaning mutter Is on the seas: A strange light over the billows flees; The air is full of a vague unease. Alas, sweet sister, What fear draws nigh? What witch-lights glister Athwart the sky? My heart with terror is like to die; And some spell holds me: I cannot fly. Was that the thunder? A strange sound fled And fainted under The Westward red. My weak wings fail me for dint of dread; The silence weighs on my heavy head. O help me, sweetest! Of all our race Thou that art fleetest And most of grace! The dread of the night draws on apace, And we are far from our resting-place. Lo, there a levin! From shore to shore Of midmost heaven Hell-bright it tore; And hark, the thunder! on heaven's floor It breaks and volleys in roar on roar. The witch! She rises Higher and higher; The gleam of her eyes is A blue bale-fire; Her stern face surges; her wings aspire; Her gold hair flames like a funeral pyre. Her incantations Are in the air; From out their stations On heaven's stair The angels flutter in wild despair; The clouds catch fire at her floating hair. Her spells have blotted The stars from sight; The sea is clotted With foam-wreaths white: The storm-clouds shut out the heaven's light: Hell's peoples gather across the night. The sea grows higher, And evermore The storm draws nigher, The billows roar; The levins lighten us o'er and o'er; The fire-bolts hurtle on sea and shore. Is there no fleeing? Sweet sister, speak. Hearing and seeing Grow dim and weak. Is't grown too late and too far to seek The land and the grot by the little creek? I see death hover; I cannot fly: Is all hope over And must we die? My voice is failing: I can but sigh: Can this be death that is drawing nigh? I call her vainly; She answers not: Alas! too plainly The cause I wot. Her sweet face sleeps in the dim sea-grot; The sea-snakes over her bosom knot. The weed is clinging Her locks among; The sea is singing Her wild death-song: Farewell, sweet sister! but not for long: Upon me also the death-chills throng. The stern sea surges Against the sky; Like sobbing dirges The wild winds sigh; My sea-drenched wings all powerless lie; The, light is fading from heart and eye. The billows thunder; The foam-bells flee: My head sinks under The raging sea: The life is fainting, is failing me: I come, sweet sister, I come to thee! THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. A ROMANCE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. Suggested by a passage in Antonio de Herrera's Historia General de las Indias Occidentales.) WE sailed from Cadiz, Perez, Blas and I, Bound westward for the golden Indian seas, One Christmas morning in the thirtieth year Since Colon furrowed first the Western main. Three old sea-dogs we were, well tried and tanned In battle and hard weather; they had sailed With the great Admiral in his first emprise And I with stout de Leon, when he flung The banner of the kingdoms to the breeze Upon the sunny shores of Florida. We had in our adventurings amassed Some store of gold, enough for our require, By stress of toilful days and careful nights And dint of dogged labour and hard knocks; And now the whitening harvest of our heads Might well have monished us to slacken sail And turn our thoughts toward the port of death, Leaving the furtherance of our emprise Unto the fresher hands of younger men. But he, who long has used to ride the deep And scent the briny breezes of the main, Inhales a second nature with the breath Of that unresting element and it, With all its spells of reckless venturousness, Grows subtly blended with his inmost soul And will not let him rest upon the land. And so we three, gray-bearded, ancient men, Furrowed with years, but yet with hearts as stout And sinews as well strung as many a youth In whom the hot blood rages, launched again Into the olden course and bent our sails Once more toward the setting. Not that we Were bitten by that fierce and senseless craze And hunger for red gold, that drove the folk By myriads to the fruitful Western shores And made the happy valleys ring with war, Plains waste with fire and red with seas of blood: A nobler, if a more unreal aim Allured our hopes toward the Occident And thawed the frost of age within our veins. I had with Leon companied, when he Sought vainly for the Isle of Bimini And heard the Indians of the Cuban coast Tell how, some fifty years agone, a tribe Had sallied thence to seek that golden strand, Where springs the Fountain of Eternal Youth, And finding it, had lost the memory Of all their native ties and lingered there, Lapt in an endless dream of Paradise. Oft had the wondrous legend stirred my sense To intermittent longing, though, what time The fire of youth was fresh within my veins, I gave scant heed to it; but when my head Grew white with winter's snows, the ancient fire Flamed up again within me and my soul Yearned unappeasably toward the West, Where welled the wondrous chrism. At my heat These two my comrades kindled to like warmth And with like aim we fitted out a ship And turned her head toward the setting sun, Holding it well to let none know our thought, But giving out we sought the general goal And went to work the mines of Paria. The Christmas bells rang cheerily, as we loosed Our carvel from its moorings and the sky Shone blue with blithest omen. So we stood Adown the harbour and with favouring winds, Came speedily to Ferro, where we took New store of meat and drink and sailing on, Had not long lost from sight the topmost peak When some enchantment seemed to fall upon And paralyse the water and the air; The glad winds dropped, the sea fell down to glass And the gold sun flamed stirless in the sky. For some score days we felt no breath of air And heard no break of ripples, but we lay And sweltered in the grip of that fierce heat. And so we drifted, in the weary calm, A slow foot forward and a slow foot back, Upon the long low folded slopes of sea, Until, when all left hope and looked for death, A swift sweet breeze sprang up and drove us on, Across foam-spangled ripples, through a waste Of wet weed-tangle; and anon the air Grew faint with balmy flower-breaths; a white bird Lit like a dream upon our sea-browned sail And brought with it the promise of the land. Softer and balmier grew the breeze and thick And thicker came the signs of nearing shores; And so, one morning, from the early mists A green-coned island rose up in our way And our glad hearts were conscious of the land. Landing, we met with Spaniards armed and clothed, Who brought us to the chief town of the isle, That lay snow-white within a blaze of green. It was New Spain, and having there refreshed Our weary bodies with a grateful rest Among the pleasant places of the isle, We trimmed our sails anew toward the West And steered into the distance with stout hearts. Through many a winding maze of wooded aits And channels where the lush boughs canopied The lucent waters in their sanded bed, We passed and smelt sweet savours of strange flowers, That filled the forests with a blaze of bloom. This coasting Cuba, and the last land passed, Where the white headland rushed into the deep And strove in vain to reach some kindred land, Lost in the infinite distance, fields of green Glittered and broke to surges, far and wide, Until the eye lost vision. Nothing feared, We bade farewell to all the terraced slopes And fragrant woodlands and with fluttering sails, Stretched out into the undiscovered seas. Fair winds soon drove us out of sight of land And in a sweet bright glory of June warmth, Attempered by lithe breezes, did we cleave, For many days, the slow and pearléd surge, Fair heaven o'er us of a wildflower's blue, With now and then a trail of golden cloud, Feathered with silver, sloping o'er its bell Of windless azure, and a jasper sea, Full of all glints and plays of jewelled light, Fishes of diamond and seaweed trails, Ruby and emerald, that bore wide blooms Of white and purple. Some enchanted land Lay for our sight beneath that crystal dome Of hyaline inverted tow'rd the sky, Drinking the soft light with so whole a bliss That some new radiance ever woke in it. So journeyed we for many a golden day And many a night enchanted, till, at last, One night, the sunset lay across the West, In one great sheet of bright and awful gold, And would not fade for twilight. Through the air The hours fled past tow'rd midnight; but the sun Was stayed by some new Joshua and the West Still seemed the land of the Apocalypse, Emblazoning the future of our hopes. We all did marvel at the miracle And some began to quake for very fear; But Perez lifted up his voice and said, “Friends, this is e'en the very sign of God, To show us, of His mercy, we shall see And come to what we long for, ere we die.” And as he spoke, a fresher breeze fell down Upon the gold-stained canvas of the sails, So that we, driving fast toward the West And its miraculous splendours, saw gold towers And spires of burning emerald glance and grow Against the golden background. Then great awe And wondrous comfort fell upon us all And from our lips, “The City of the Lord!” Came with a reverent triumph, for it seemed Indeed the town of pearl and golden gates And angels walking in the beryl streets; And as we ever ran toward the place, The joy of Mary did possess our hearts And kneeling down together on the deck, We all linked hands and offered thanks to God. The hours went by and lengthened out to days, And yet no darkness curtained that fair fire, No sign of dawning glimmered in the East; But still that glory flamed across the West And still into the setting fled our bark. So, as we counted it by lapse of time, Bereft of natural signs of dark and light, Seven days had passed, and on the seventh day, At fall of eventide, or what is wont To be that time in this our world that knows No miracles, the splendours gathered up And running all together like a scroll, Were bound into a single blazing globe, That gradually did shrink upon itself, Until it was but as a greater star And hung in heaven, a splendid lucent pearl, Flooding the purple twilight with soft fire. And as the flaming curtain passed away And left the Westward empty, from the span Of ocean full before us, rose a slope Of pleasant shores and smiling terraces, Crowned with a tender glory of fair green. Our hearts leapt up within us; something spoke To us of the fulfilment of our hopes; And as we drew yet nearer, snow-white sands, Gemmed with bright shells and coloured wonderments Of stones and seaweed, sparkled on the rim Of the glad blue, and what seemed palaces Of dream-like beauty shimmered afar off, Like agates, through the mazes of the woods. We ran the carvel through a wooded reach Of shelving water, clear and musical With fret of breaking ripples on the stones, And drove the keel into the yielding sand, Where, with a gracious curve, the silver shore Sloped down and held the ocean in its arms. Landing, we entered, through a portico Of columned palms, a forest fair and wide, Wherein long glades ran stretching in the calm And rayed out through the leafage on all hands; And as our feet trod grass, the tropic night Was wasted and the cool sweet early day Was born in the blue heavens. On all sides, The fruitful earth was mad with joy of Spring, Not, as in our cold West, the painful lands Flower with a thin spare stint of meagre blooms, But with a blaze of heaven's own splendrousness Moulded to blossom; in the lavish land There was not room enough for the blithe blooms To spread to fulness their luxuriance; And so they ran and revelled up the trunks And seizing all the interspace of air, Shut out the sky with frolic flowerage. And as we went, the cloisters of the woods Rang with the golden choirings of the birds, Gods' poets, that did give Him praise for Spring, And all the tender twilight of the woods Was brimmed with ripples of their minstrelsy. Some hours we journeyed slowly through the aisles Of emerald, hung with flower-trails wild and sweet, Whose scent usurped the waftings of the breeze And lapt our senses in a golden dream,— Slowly, I say; for wonder held our feet And we were often fain to halt and feed Our dazed eyes on the exquisite fair peace Of all things' perfect beauty and delight. At last, we came to where the cloistered glades Grew wider and we heard a noise of bells And glad wide horn-notes floating through the trees And waning lingeringly along the aisles; And a far voice of some most lovely sound Held all the air with one enchanted note, As 'twere the cadence of the angels' song, When in the dawn the gates of heaven unfold, Had floated down and lit upon the earth. And then the forest ceased and in the noon, Now that the sun rode high in the blue steeps, We saw a fair white city in the plain, Rounded with blossomed flowers and singing rills And fringed with tender grace of nestling trees. The gates stood open for our welcoming And in we passed, but saw none in the ways And wandered slowly onward through the streets, Misdoubting us the whole might be a dream And loath to speak, lest something break the charm. Full lovely and most pleasant was the place, Builded with palaces of purest white And columns graven in all gracious shapes Of lovely things, that harbour in the world Or in the poet's fancy. All the walls Were laced with golden tracery and set With precious marbles, cunningly y-wrought To delicate frail fretwork. Argent spires Rose, pistil-like, toward the heavens serene, From out moon-petalled flower-domes and the roofs Seemed, in the noontide, one great graven prayer, For the aspiring of their minarets. Fair courtyards caught the quiet from the air And hoarded up the shadow in their hearts, Making the stillness musical with pearls And silver of their fountains' gurgling plash. A city of the pleasance of the Gods It seemed, embowered in a flower-soft calm, Soiled by no breath of clamour or desire. So did we wander up that silver street, As one who, in the lapses of a dream, Goes like a God, for lack of wonderment, And came to where a sudden water welled Among moss-feathered pebbles and was turned Into the middle way, wherein it ran Along the agate stones, rejoicingly, And marged itself with bands of vivid bloom. It was so clear and sang so sweet a song Of cool fresh quiet that we all were fain To halt and lave our hands and feet in it, So haply virtue might be had from it Of its untroubled blitheness. This being done, We wandered on again by that fair flood, That seemed to us a rippled silver clue, Unwinded by some river-deity, Friendly to man, and leading, step by step, To some far seat of exquisite idlesse. So came we where the long slow quiet way Was done and lost itself in one wide space, Where columns stood in fair and measured ranks, Arched with a running frieze of graven work. Stately and tall they were, cornelian-plinthed, With stems of jasper and chalcedony, And ran in goodly order round the place, Circling a wide bright curtilage of clear And polished marble, veined with branching gold And jacinth woven in its cloudless grain. In the mid-square a cistern, lipped with pearl And hollowed from the marble of the floor, Was clear with crystal water, through whose lymph One saw the bottom paved with cunning shapes Of ancient legends, beasts and birds and flowers, Fashioned in yellow gold on milk-white stone. Into the cistern emptied all its rills The laughing stream that ran beside our feet, And filling all the cool still flood with gleams And rippled swirls and eddies of its own Mercurial silver, passed out o'er a slope Of jasper from the cistern's farther side And gurgled through a channel in the floor, Wherefrom it drew that sweet and murmurous noise Of soft accords suspended, that had swelled Upon us in the opening of the wood, Until its silver blended with the green Of a cool woodland shadow and its chirp Of laughing ripples in the cloistered calm Of arching trunks was silent. Following The blithe stream's way, we stood upon the brink Of that cool crystal and gazed down through it Upon the inlaid figures in the bed, That flashed and wavered so with that unrest Of ceaseless currents, that they seemed to us To have again a strange half-life in them And nod and sign to us. We dipped our hands For idlesse in the lappings of the stream, That curled and glistered on the marble's brim, And wondered idly what these things might be That were so fairly pictured on the stone, And if the place were void of living soul To use its dainty brightness. So we might Have stood and gazed and dreamed away the day, So fair a spell of quiet held the air; But, as we listened, suddenly a sound Of various music smote upon our ears, And we were ware of some enchanted throb Of very lovely singing, that for aye Drew nearer, as it were the singers came Toward us, in the near vicinity. And as it grew, the air was all a-flower With intermingling antiphons of sound; The passionate pulse of harp-strings, smitten soft To wait upon the cadenced swell and wane Of the alternate voices, throbbed and stirred In the cool peace of that sweet reverend place: High steeples rained bell-silver on the roofs And the clear gold of clarions floated up And echoed through the columned solitudes. Before us rose a high and stately wall, Painted with cunning past the skill of men,— It seemed to us,—with shapes of olden time, Presenting, in deep colours, like the flush Of flowers that diapers the fields in June, All things that have been celebrate of old, Shapes of high kings, of heathen men and dames, Ladies and knights in dalliance of love Or ranged in rank of feast or tournament; (I do remember once I saw the like, But in a meaner fashion and less fair, At Naples, when our army held the realm Against the French). Surpassing fair they were, Gods in the aspect and most worshipful, Clad in bright raiment, gold and purpurine. So goodly was their seeming and withal So wonder-lively fashioned, that we looked To see them leave their places on the wall And walk among us and have speech of us. Between two columns in the midst, a space Was set apart, whereon no living thing Was limnéd, but the stone was subtly wrought With graven silver, arabesqued and chased In interwoven patterns, very bright And strange, wherein we wondered much to see That ever sphere did twine with sphere, nor was There any angled figure in the woof, Except one great gold cross, that broke the play Of circles in the centre of the space. In this a wide door opened, that had been So closely fitted to the joining wall That our eyes had no cognizance of it, And foldíng back itself on either side, Gave passage to our sight into an aisle Of cloistered fretwork, at whose farthest end Shone glint of mystic gold and blazonry. It was not clear for distance, at the first, What was it moved and glittered in the haze; But, as we gazed, a train of stately men, Vestured in flowing garments, swept along The heart of that cool stillness and did come Majestically tow'rd us with slow steps. And as they grew into our clearer sight, We saw they were full goodly to behold, Gracious in carriage and with pòort assured In simple nobleness. It seemed to us That we had known such figures in some dream Of bygone days, so strangely bright they were Of aspect and serene in kindly peace, Resembling nothing earthly we had seen. Their vesture was no less unknown to us, Being of some fair white fabric, soft as silk And looped with broad rich gold and broidery Of banded silver, and their flowing hair Was knitted with the plumes of strange bright birds, That flashed and sparkled gem-like in the sun, Emerald and gold and turquoise. At their head Came one whose visage wore a special air Of reverence and simplicity, uncrossed By any furrow of ignoble care. Adown his breast a fair white beard did flow And foam-white was the flowerage of his head; But else of sad wan eld was little trace Upon his mien, except for venerance. It seemed as if his youth had held so dear The sojourn of life's spring-time, it had chosen Rather to consort with the drifts of age Than spread sad wings toward a fresher haven. Upon his front a band of woven gold, Graven with symbols, added evidence Unneeded to his brow's regality, And in his hand a silver wand he bore, Whereon a golden falcon spread its wings And poised itself as if for imminent flight. We all bowed heads, as conscious of some might Of soul and station far above our own; And that mild ancient, casting on us all His eyes' benignness, gave us welcoming, In speech so clear and universal-toned, We could not choose but apprehend his words And the fair meaning of them, when he said, “Be welcome to the City of the Day, O seekers for the Isle of Bimini!” And knew that here at last our quest was won. Then did he speak to those that followed him, And the fair youths, that were his chamberlains, Laid gentle hands on us and led us all Into the inner palace, where we soothed Our weary limbs with soft and fragrant baths And girt us in new garments of fair white, Made rich with bands of silken broidery. This done, our weariness and our fatigues Fell from us with our travel-stainéd weeds And we were as new men in heart and limb. Then joyously we followed those our guides, Through many an aisle of fair and lucent stone, Into a wide and lofty banquet-hall, Where the pierced walls showed through the azure sky And shaped the light that won across the chinks Into a dainty fretted lace of gold. High up into the shadow curved the roof And treasured up, in many a tender gloom Of amethyst and purple, echoings Of woodland songs and cool of forest shades And soft sweet breezes straying in the flowers. For bearing of its bell of latticed blue Were columns of majestic linden-trees, Whose blossom scented all the luminous air; And in the boughs gold-feathered birds did make Rare music for the pleasance of the folk That lay below in many a goodly rank, Reclined among sweet scents and lavish flowers. There could no shaft of sun be wearisome Nor airless ardour of the heavy noon, For green of shading boughs and silver plash Of ceaseless fountains in the hollow coigns. Here was a goodly banquet furnished forth; And as we entered, he that ruled the feast Did set us near himself and talked with us And showed and told us many goodly things And marvels that had usance in the place. Then did we ask him of that fabled stream That had such puissance for defeat of age; Whereat his visage grew, meseemed, a thought O'ershadowed; but anon he smiled on us And made fair answer that, ourselves refreshed With needful rest and slumber, he himself Would on the morrow further our desire Toward the fount miraculous; and turned The talk to other things and bade us leave Our past fatigues and eat and drink new life. Great joyance had we in the pleasant things That were presented to our every sense, And great refreshing for our weary souls, Jaded with age and unrelenting toil. Nor, in the progress of the glad repast, Did cheer sink down to grossness; for we ate Of fruits and meats (and drank of wines the while, Costly and rich) that were so delicate And noble in their essence, and did hear And see and scent such high and lovely things, That all that was most godlike in ourselves Did cast off imperfection for the nonce And was made pure by that most sweet convérse. The banquet ended, minstrels took their harps And sang the praises of the blossom-time And high delights of bright and puissant love: How May is sweet with amorous affects And all things in its season know but one And flower and sing and are most fair for one And one alone most tender, holiest Love: How life in love has ever deathless Spring, And all the early glory of the year Is but the travail of the earth with love, That is told forth in bloom of painted flowers And silver speech of many-choiring birds. And these strains ended with applause of all And to the great enhancement of our peace, Another smote the soft complaining strings To notes of graver sweetness and did sing A quaint sad song of Autumn and of Death, Made very sweet with joining cadences Of silver harp-notes. Thus, methinks, it ran:— LET others praise the May for bright and clear And Love, that in the flower-time thrives amain: For me, my songs shall hymn the dying year And death, that is the salve of mortal pain. For what is autumn but the grateful wane Of weary summer to the sleep of snows? And what is winter but the earth's repose, And death the cold sweet close of some new Spring, That folds to slumber every tired thing? Let others walk to hear the roundelay Of song-birds quiring to the risen year: For me, I love the quiet throstle's lay, When in the woods the shredded leaves are sere And the faint heavens are watchet in the mere. The autumn's pale calm grey of sober peace Is lovelier to me than the swift increase Of colour in the spring-tide's restless air; For my heart flowers when the boughs are bare. If love be May, then love is nought to me; For in my thought his sweets are sweeter far When in the deepening twilight shadows flee, When all delights but half unfolded are And waste fulfilment comes not to unbar The gates of weariness. Faint flowers are sweet And murmured music daintily doth greet My senses more than bolder scent or song: I will my joys not fierce to be, but long. Sweet death, if men do fear thy tender touch, It is because they know thee not for fair, Since that their eyes are dazzled over-much By fierce delights of life and blinding glare Of unenduring bliss, that throws despair Behind it as its shadow, when the sun Slopes through the evening and the hills are dun. They would not call thee dark and wan and cold, Had their faint eyes but shunned the noon's full gold. For lo! thou art not black to loving eyes, But tender grey, not unillumed by rose Or that pale feathery gold that on the skies Of autumn such a sad sweet glory throws. Though in thy shades no glare of sunlight glows, Yet through thy dusk a tender moon of hope Is clear, nor lacks there in the misted slope Of thy long vistas many a helpful light, O Death, for very piteous is thy might! Let those that love them sing of Love and May; I give to Love full sweet another name And with soft sighs and singings to Him pray, And not with trumpets' silver-strong acclaim Blazon to men his wonder-working fame: For my Love's name is Death, and I am fain To love the long sad years and life's kind wane; For what is autumn but a later Spring And what is Death but life's revesturing? Thus blithely sped the golden-footed hours Athwart the sloping sunlight of the space Twixt noon and dusk, in various delight Of song and converse, till the purple webs Of night began to flutter o'er the gold Of sunset, and the air of that bright place Was strewn with pearls of moonlight. Then men brought Great golden-fleecéd webs of silk-soft wool And furs of white and sable-coated beasts And laid them on the floor and thereon strewed Fair green of moss and rainbow plumages Of exquisite strange birds, whereon the folk, Won with light labour to fatigue as light And easeful, soon addressed themselves to rest. But those fair youths, to whom we were in charge, Unbidden, brought us to a place apart, Wherein fair chambers, golden-ceiled and hung With gray and purple arras, lay beside An aisle of columned marble, stretching down, With casements clear and quaintly-carven roofs, Through many a tender vista of soft shade And trellised leafage: there did we bestow Our weary limbs and heard the nightingale, All night among the windless myrtle-groves Without, entreating all the tremulous air To passion with the splendour of her song, Woven with flower-scents inextricably. The night was fair for us with happy dreams, And in the morning, ere the sun had drawn The early mists from off the blushing day, There came to us the king of that fair land And did entreat us rise and harness us; For that the place we sought was from the town Distant a long day's journey, and the time Was gracious, in the freshness of the dawn, To break the earlier hardness of the way. Then did we all take horse and riding forth By the fair guiding silver of the brook, That ran toward the northward of the town, We passed through many a leafy forest glade And saw the fresh flowers wet with the night dew And listened to the newly-wakened birds, That sang their clearest for the fair young day. Right goodly was the aspect of the earth, Clad with glad blooms and flushed with joy of Spring, As on we wended in the early morn, Before the grossness of the noon fell down: And as we went, a goodly company, The minstrels lifted up their voice and sang, As birds that could not choose but music make, For very joyance of the pleasant time. And one right well I marked, who made the birds From every sunny knoll and budded copse Give back blithe antiphons of melody To every phrase and cadence of his song. Comely and young he was and passing skilled In making lays and rondels for the lute:— And this, among a crowd of sweeter songs, If memory serve me rightly, did he sing. BELLS of gold where the sun has been, Azure cups in the woven green, Who in the night has been with you And painted you golden and jewel-blue And brimmed your flower-cups with diamond dew? Lo! in the evening Spring was dead And the flowers had lost their maidenhead Under the burning kiss of the sun: Tell me, who was the shining one That came by night, when the sky was dun And the pale thin mists were over the moon, And brimmed your hearts with the wine of noon? Who was it breathed on the painted May, Under the screen of the shadow play, And gave it life for another day? I watched at the setting to see him ride, But only saw the day that died, The faint-eyed flow'rets shrink and fail Into their shrouding petals' veil And all things under the moon turn pale. I watched in the night, but saw no thing. I heard in the midnight the grey bird sing And ran to look for the shape of power, But saw no thing in the silence flower, Save moonmists over forest and bower. Goldcups, it could not have been the May, For dead in the twilight the Spring-time lay, Under the arch of the setting sun, Ere in the gloaming the day was done And the masque of the shadows had begun. But lo! in the early scented morn A new delight in the air was born; Brighter than ever bloomed the Spring, The glad flowers blew and the birds did sing And blithe was every living thing. Merles that flute in the linden-hall, Larks, if ye would, ye could tell me all; Ye that were waking at break of day, Did ye see no one pass away, With ripple of song and pinion-play? Ah! I am sure that ye know him well, Although ye are false and will not tell! Haply, natheless, I shall be near And hear you praise him loudly and clear, Some day when ye wit not I can hear. So wended we with mirth and minstrelsy Throughout the morning hours, and presently Emerging from the pleasant wood, we rode By many a long stretch of level plains, Waved fields of rainbow grasses and wide moors Bejewelled thick with white and azure bells, And saw rich flowercups, all ablaze with gold And purple, lie and swelter in the sun, And others, blue as is the sky at noon Unclouded, trail and crawl along the grass And star the green with sudden sapphire blooms. And then we came to where the frolic brook Swelled into manhood and its silver thread Was woven out into a river's stretch Of broad, unruffled crystal. Here a boat, Wide bowed and long, lay rocking on the stream, Among great lazy lilies, white and red And regal purple, lolling in the sun. Dismounting here, we floated up the tide, Propelled by one that stood upon the prow And spurned the sanded bottom with his pole, Along wide sunny lapses of the stream, Now breasting rushes, purple as the tips Of fair Aurora's fingers, when she parts The veils of daybreak, now embowered in green And blue of floating iris. Through long rifts Of wooded cliffs we passed, where here and there The naked rock showed white as a swan's breast, Riven through and through by veins of virgin gold, Or haply cleft with gaping crevices, Wherethrough the jewelled riches of its heart Did force themselves from out their treasury And staunched the cloven wound with precious salve Of living diamond. Here the water showed, Through its clear lymph, great crystals in the bed And nuggets of bright metal, water-worn To strange fantastic shapes; and now and then, As we did paddle idly with our hands, Letting the clear stream ripple through the chinks Of our obstructing fingers, with a sound Of soft melodious plaining for the check, A great gold-armoured fish, with scales of pearl And martlets of wine-red upon his back, Rose slowly to the surface, waving all The pennons of his fins, and gazed at us With fearless eyes. And there the wrinkled bed Shelved súddenly into a deep clear pool, Whose brink was fringed with waving water-bells; And at the bottom lay gold-colured shells And silver pearls embedded in brown sand, And many a fish and harmless water-snake Floated and crawled along the river-weeds. But nothing harmful seemed to us to dwell Within that fair clear water; — pike nor coil Of deadly worm, nor on the verging banks In field or copse, as far as eye could see, Was any lynx or wolf or brindled beast, To stir the lovely stillness of the land With whisper of disquiet. As we went, Much wondering at the goodly peace that reigned In all and at the marvellous fair things That glided by us, Perez took a lute (Full featly could he turn a stately song,) And praised the place and its serene delights. “O HAPPY pleasaunce of the gods!”he sang, “Where all is fair and there is harm in nought, Where never lightnings break nor thunder-clang, Nor ever summer air with storm is fraught, Nor by the hurtling hail is ruin wrought, But kindly nature is at peace with man And all things sweetly fill their given span! “O pleasant land, where winter never blinds The bare waste ways with snowdrift, nor the frost With wrinkled ice the sad wan waters binds, Nor Spring-tide joy by winter thoughts is crost, Where never hope for weariness is lost, But life is warm, though woods be cold and grey, And never in the flower-hearts dies the May! “Where never skies are dull, nor tempest scowls, Nor monster riots in the river's glass, Where never in the woods the fierce beast prowls, But in the fields the harmless snake does pass, A living jewel, through the flowered grass, Where sun burns not, nor breaths of winter freeze, Nor thunder-blasts shrill drearly through the trees! “Yet is there nothing here that in the air Should breathe such potency of healing balm As might compel the unkindly blast to spare Or birds to sing a never-ending psalm, Or meadows glitter with the summer calm, Or purge the terror from the winter grim: But men love God and put their trust in Him! “And so all things of His do they hold dear And see in all His handiwork a friend, And not a foe,—and therefore skies are clear And flowers are sweet, because men's souls intend The essence of well-being and so bend The kindred life of wood and field and fell To that fair peace that in themselves does dwell! “For man it is that makes his circumstance, Honouring all and loving all things good, Bethinking him how he may best advance The harvesting of nature's kindly mood, By helping her in that relief she would Be ever working for his cheer and stay: So doth he love and joy in her alway. “O happy folk that dwell in such a land! O happy land that hast such habitants, That know to walk with nature hand in hand And find new cheer in every change and chance, Not thinking, when the long grey days advance And summer's gold is dying, hope is less; But proving lightly all things' goodliness.” So swung we slowly up that lazy flood, Rejoicing in the gladness of the time, Until its course did leave the open plains And turned into a forest, intertwined So closely o'er our heads with knitted boughs And charm of woven leaves, that we could see No glimpse of sun nor glitter of the clear Sweet firmament, nor any moving thing, But only heard dim splashes in the flood Of water-rat or duck and distant chirp Of birds that far above our heads climbed up To hymn the mounting chariot of the sun. In that dim emerald shadow, some strange peace And spell of haunting quiet seemed to brood And soften all the voices of the wood And rustle of the leafage to repose. Above us rose the high steep flowered banks, Heavy with fragrances from unseen bells Exhaled of sweet and drowsy-scented flowers, And all around the columns of the trees Stretched dimly in the twilight, like the aisles Of some immense cathedral, where the voice Of praise and joy is hushed to reverent prayer. And there no bird or beast did seem to dwell Nor breeze to creep and sigh among the trees; But in its own mysterious sanctity The forest lay and waited for the voice Of some high champion that should break the charm And win the secret of those mystic deeps. The air grew dark, and a fresher breeze Sprang up and told us of the waning day; And then the oarsman laid aside his blade And loosed the wide sail from the tapering mast, Wherein the glad air gathered did so swell And struggle, that the boat leapt swiftly on Between the shelving woodways. And anon The gold of sunset flamed in through the mask Of thinning trees, and then the prow was free From that dark pass of overhanging wood, And the day's light was large on us again. The river lapsed, thro' fringing marish plants And ranks of rustling reeds, into the glass Of a clear lakelet, where the white discs lay, Gold-hearted, in the quiet, and our stem Cut through the fronded lake-weeds grudgingly And won slow way toward the other shore, Where, with a hollow roar, the river leapt And fell into a dark and shaded cave. There landed we and moored the barge with ropes, And following our guides, made shift to win, Athwart a rocky passage, to a screen Of netted boughs and bushes that shut out For us the blue horizon's golden marge. Some time we struggled through the arduous growth Of underwood and brambles, intertwined With scarlet-blossomed creepers, till at length The last boughs closed behind us and we stood Upon the lower slope of a tall hill And gazed into the sunset with rapt eyes. A wide deep champaign stretched before our view, Encircled with a sapphire chain of hills, On whose high crests the crown of sunset lay, Hallowing the landscape with a blaze of gold. Fair and most awful was the majesty Of that day's death upon the guardian hills, Wrapt in the visible glory of the Lord; And with one impulse, as the budded flames Of imminent heaven lay on us, we all Fell down upon our knees and worshippéd, As knowing the great God was surely there. So knelt we all in silence, till the sun Had faded from the westward and the grey, Washed with pale gold, that fills the interspace 'Twixt ended day and night, held all the air With its mild tender afterglow. Then he Whose brow was kingly with the banded gold Arose and went a little way aside Within some trees, that stood apart from us About the casting of an arbalest. And made as if he sought for something there; And coming, in a little, back to us, He took my hand, and signing to the rest To follow, led us all into a nook, Wherein tall oak-trees circled round a rock Of moss-veined marble. Therein entering, A fitful radiance, as it were the play. Of glancing diamonds, glittered in our eyes, And looking round, we saw where from the stone A fair clear water trickled, drop by drop, Between lush webs of golden-threaded moss, And fell in jewelled sprays of liquid light Upon the crystal pebbles. Very pure And clear it was and so unearthly bright In the dim twilight of that shadowy place, We doubted not but here our quest was filled And this was e'en that fountain where our flesh, Being laved, should put off sad and weary age And clothe itself anew with goodly youth. Then he who led us signed to us to drink, For this was that same water we had sought And wearied for so long by sea and land. Albeit, for a space we could not stir For wonderment, commingled with strange awe And ravishment of our fulfilled desires, That was nigh pain for very mightiness. And then Blas stepped toward that trickling thread Of crystal and did stoop him down to drink; And ere his knees touched earth, I, following, Bent down my hand into the rippled pool, That lay beneath the downfall of the rill, And drawing back an instant for surprise At the most deathly coldness of the stream, Made shift to gather water for a draught Within the hollowed middle of my palm. It scattered into diamonds through the chinks Of my unnervéd fingers and did leave So scant a pool of fluid in my hand, That I was fain to stoop and fill again, With more attent precaution, ere I wet My lips with it. I filled my two joined palms And was about to raise them to my mouth, Nay, almost steeped my lips, when suddenly, Reflected in the streamlet, I was ware Of some strange light that was made visible From out the dusk above, and looking up, I spied a moonèd wonder in the air, Full of strange lights and mystic harmonies Of blending colour; and as I did gaze, I saw a great white cross, that grew and burnt In ïts fair middle. Wonder and great awe Unclasped my hands and brought them to my face, To hide from my weak sight that awful light, Whereby the unwilling water once again Did have its liberty and showered down, Like broken jewels, back into the pool. And as I knelt, with awed and hidden eyes, I heard a voice that spake from out the bell Of that miraculous flower, most reverend And awful, as it were the living God; And these words smote my hearing: “Foolish men, That thought God like another of yourselves, That make a work and set it up for good And after look again and know it ill And straightway raze and build it up anew, Repenting of the framework of your hands,— Know that the Lord of all cannot repent Nor turn again His ordered harmonies Of life and death and Nature, saying not, ‘I have not wrought it seemly—I repent!’ Nor can His hands undo what He has done. “O fools and hard of heart! in all these years Have ye then never read earth's parable Of day and night alternate, seed and fruit, That tells you dusk must be ere light can come? Lo, in the fields the summer's lavish bloom Is spent and wasted by the autumn's breath And dies with winter, to revive with spring; And all things fill their order, birds and beasts And all that unto earthly weal pertains. Nor will the spheric working change its course Nor slacken for the prayers of foolish men, That lift fond voice for what their baby eyes Deem good and all-sufficient in desire, Seeing only, in their circumscribéd scope, A segment of the circle of God's love. “So may not the renewing of lost youth Be won but through the natural way of death, And man must,—like an ear of corn, that droops And withers in the ground before it stir And sprout again with gay and goodly bloom,— Yield up his wayworn flesh and weary soul Unto the soothing rest of friendly death, Ere a new fire shall stir the curdled blood Of age to a new ardour and the soul Be clad afresh with robes of lusty youth. “Wherefore know ye that, of a certainty, None shall have life, excepting first he die. And therefore is this water cold as death; For through its death is life the quicklier won. Wherefore, if ye repent of your desire And will to wear in weariness of eld The sad remainder of your lagging years, Rather than dare the icy plunge of death, Depart and purge your hearts of foolish hope.” With that it ceased: and we, for wonderment And awe, awhile could neither move nor speak; But still that splendour hung upon the air And still we veiled our eyes for reverence. Then Perez rose and coming to the brink Of that miraculous water, knelt and said; “Lord, I have haste for youth and fear not death, For joy of that great hope that is beyond.” So lightly he addressed himself to drink Of that clear stream; and we, that watched him do, When as the water touched him, saw his face, As 'twere an angel's, with heroic love And faith transfigured for a moment's space; And then such glory broke from that high cross And shone athwart his visage, that we fell Aswoon upon the grass for fear and awe And had no further sense of what befell. When life again returned into my brain, The night was wasted, and the early dawn Was golden in the Orient. As my eyes Grew once more open to the light of day, I found myself outstretched upon the sand Of that fair shore, where we had landed first, Hard by our place of entry in the wood. Around me were my comrades; some, like me, Awaking from the trance of that strange sleep And others working on the caravel, That lay high up upon the waveless strand, Striving to push her down to meet the tide That crawled up slowly from the outer sea. But every sign of our adventurings In that fair city, with those goodly men, And of that wondrous fountain of the hills, Was vanished. In the tangles of the wood, The fair white dwellings we had seen with eyes, When first the sunset led us to the place, Had disappeared, nor in the forest's close Green front of woven boughs, that stood opposed Toward the ocean, was there visible A single opening, wherethrough we might chance Again upon the cloistered woodland way, That led us to the wonder-lovely town. Nor was there any sign or any trace Of habitance of men or mortal use Therein: but all was as no human foot, Save ours, had trodden on the silver sand. At this we marvelled greatly and most like Would have misdoubted all to be a dream, But that there lay beside us on the strand Our comrade, Perez, not,—as first it seemed To us,—asleep, but,—as we soon knew,—dead. And still his visage wore the wondrous smile Of deathless ravishment it had put on With the clear draught of that miraculous fount. And so we knew that it had been no dream, But that our eyes had seen our hearts' desire And God Himself had surely talked with us. Long with persistent hope we searched the shore Around the little harbour on all sides, So haply we might once more light upon The woodway leading to the inland plain And its blithe wonders: but the silent trees Were secret and would show no trace of it. And so with heavy hearts we left our search And made a grave for burial of the dead And laid him there with a sad reverence, With wail and music of a funeral song; For very dear the man had been to us, Being of a noble nature and approved In all renown of worth and steadfastness. Then sadly from a little smooth-stemmed tree We rove a branch and hewing it in twain, Made shift to fashion of the peeled white wood The rude resemblance of the blessed Rood And planted it for memory on the grave. And as we did this thing, the forest air Was voiceful with the carol of a bird, That piped and piped as though he ne'er should die. So joyous was his song and full of hope, It seemed as if the angel of the dead Had entered in the semblance of a fowl And sang to give us lightening of our grief. And so it came to pass that with the song Our hearts were comforted and some did deem They saw himself that stood upon the strand And beckoned to us not to tarry there Nor strive against the given will of God, But turn our prow from off that hallowed shore. We waited not for bidding, but launched out And made the swift keel whistle through the surge. LAUTREC. “Vocantur mortui vampiræ in quibus, aut lunæ luminis crescentis receptione, aut quæcunque aliæ influentiae potentiâ diabolicæ, infusa sit vita impia nocturnaque, vi cujus sepulcrum frangunt, Dianâque fulgente per terram errantes, sanguine dormientium horridè pascuntur. Fertur etiam nonnunquam ita trucidatos vampiras ipsos vicissim factos esse.— P. van Tonynck, Infernalia. 1533. THE moon comes strangely late to-night, And yet meseems the dusk has laid On all its woven hands of shade; Spent is the tall wan altar-light And the last vesper-prayer is pray'd. The last chimes of the vesper bell Along the sighing wind have died; And as it were a shadowtide Rolled upward from the gates of Hell, The stern gloom surges far and wide. I lie close shut within my bier; And yet, despite the graven stone, I feel the spells the night has strown, The spells of sorcery and fear, Unto me through the air sink down: The many-mingling influences; The viewless throb of awful mights; The flutter of the grey-wing'd sprights; A press of shadowy semblances; The dreadful things that fly by nights. I feel the spells of Fate and Fear That hold the empire of the dark: Like unseen birds their flight I mark Athwart the teeming air and hear The ghosts rush past me, as I hark. Lo! there the charm fled through the night That sets the witch's black soul free To revel over earth and sea, Whilst the reft corpse lies stark and white: And still the grave grips hold on me. Ah! there again the hot thrill swept Across the dusk brown-breasted air. I know it: see, the graves gape bare, Answering; and one by one, upleapt, The hell-hounds startle from their lair. A flash as of a dead man's eyes, Blue as the fires that streak the storm! And from their dwelling with the worm, See where the restless spirits rise, Each like a vapour in man's form. The signs begin to thicken fast: A noise of horns, as if there blew The clarions of all storms that brew Within the world-womb for the blast That bids the earth and sea renew: And to that call the shapes rouse forth That make night weird with wailing ghosts Of frightful beasts, whose flame-breathed hosts East unto West and South to North Laid waste of old the night's grey coasts; Until the Christ-god came to bear Back with his smile the age's gloom, And withered back into their doom, They died: yet, wraiths of what they were, Still in the night they cheat the tomb And wander over hill and dale, An awful host, invisible: But he, who fares by wood and dell, Hears their wings rustle and their wail Shrills through him like a wind of hell. I know them all, ghost, witch and beast; I hear them hurtle through the gloom; The glad ghosts scatter from their room; The ghouls fare forth unto the feast: Still I lie fast within the tomb. For lo! the Queen of my desire,— The dreadful Lady of the Night, That fills my veins with wine of light, Sacring me with her cold white fire, — Sleeps yet cloud-hidden from my sight. And here I lie, wrapt in my shroud, Moveless and cold upon the bier; And all my rage of wish and fear Unto the hush I cry aloud, In tones that only sprites may hear. And in the fever of my mood, The passion of the days of yore Swims like a mist of flame before My haggard eyes, — a mist of blood, A meteor-play of tears and gore. And one white face, mark'd out in lines And silver characters of fire, Flames like a phantom of desire Against my sight; and through the pines The night-wind, screaming nigh and nigher, Is as a well remember'd voice, That once to me was honey-sweet As that the white soul waits to greet, When heaven's sight bids the eye rejoice, Opening upon the golden street. Ay, once that visage was to me As Christ's face seen upon the rim Of heaven, betwixt the cherubim; That voice was as the melody Of angels calling, through the dim Hush'd heart of Death, to him who lies And waits the coming of the feet Of that white angel stern and sweet, That gives the keys of Paradise Or opens up Hell's sulphur-seat. There was great love betwixt us twain: The memory of the time we kiss'd In passionate innocence, nor wist Of any harm, will never wane, Maugre this bloody moonshot mist. Despite this trance of tears and blood, Remember it for aye shall I; And the warm lovelight in his eye, When for my answering kiss he sued, Will haunt my curst eternity. Yea, though the fathomless abyss Of doom lie gaped our souls between, His soul, that walks in Heaven's sheen, Shall burn for ever with that kiss, Though Hell flame 'twixt us for a screen. Yea, even midst the blaze of stars, That light the golden city's air, My face shall stand out weird and fair; My voice shall reach him through Hell's bars, Across the din of harps and prayer. I was the daughter of a king; And he a simple knight that bent His knee before my sire and went About the world, adventuring In battle and in tournament. A simple knight he was: but none In all the land was fair to see Or glorious in fight as he: There was no man beneath the sun Could match with him in chivalry. (Woe's me, how fierce the anguish is Of memory and how the blue Of his two eyes, soft shining through The year-mists, like twin stars of bliss, Prevails my passion to renew! Those star-soft eyes! And too the red Of his clear lips, that on mine eyes Did shed the dews of Paradise In kisses, such as stir the dead And bid the shrouded ghost arise!) I do remember how he told Me first the love he bore to me: It was one summer, when the bee Humm'd through a burning mist of gold And fruit flamed on the orange tree. The day had been a day made bright With many a noble deed of arms: All day the trumpet's shrill alarms Rang through the golden summer-light; And the hush'd noontide's drowsy charms Of sun and shade were cleft and stirr'd With grinding shock of shield and spear; And from the banner'd gallery-tier I looked upon the lists and heard The sword-play ring out loud and clear. Queen of the tourney was I set And watch'd the harness'd spearmen dash Athwart the mellay and the flash Of helmets, as the fair knights met And the spears shiver'd in the crash. Full many a deed of arms was done And many a mighty man that day Rode, meteor-like, through the array: But over all the mellay shone One knight's white plume; and through the fray Rose Lautrec's war-cry, as he clave The throng of riders and the sweep Of his broad falchion did reap The mail-clad knights, as some stout knave Shears through the corn-sheaves tall and deep. So all day long he rode the press And all day long his stout arm held The lists, until the curfew knell'd And down behind the Western ness The gold sun cover'd up his shield. Wherefore the prize to him was given Of that day's tourney, for that he Unconquer'd and unfalteringly Against the press of knights had striven, Until the sunset kiss'd the sea. I set the prize upon his brow— A wreath of laurel, fairly chased In gold and with rich emeralds graced— And as he louted him full low, Whilst on his uncasqued front I placed The jewelled cirque, his eyes met mine And from their velvet deeps there shone So clear a fire into mine own, That thence my warm soul drank like wine An ecstasy till then unknown. The evening came, a night of stars; And from the hall, where torches stood And lit the banquet,—in my mood Of new sweet thought,—I raised the bars And wander'd out into the wood. There was the evening wind at play Betwixt the tall stems of the treen; And in the tender twilight sheen The summer sweetness died away And fainted in that heart of green. Alone I went,—yet not alone; For sweet thoughts held me company And new strange impulses did flee Through every vein; the clear stars shone, As though the heavens loved with me. And as I wander'd, lo! there came A far soft sound of nearing feet Along the woodways still and sweet. Hope soar'd within me like a flame And my thought bounded out to meet His step that came along the glade: For it was Lautrec, who like me Had stolen forth from revelry, To seek the friendly forest shade And have his thought for company. A burning blush rose to my cheek; Mine eyes sank to the earth for fear, As though my shy sight could not bear The glory of his gaze: too weak My sense seem'd for the awful cheer Of his bright visage. But he bent His knee before me on the grass, And as his eyes met mine (alas! How full of sweets and dreariment The memory is) the fire did pass Of mutual love betwixt us twain; Then, with a sob of fear and bliss, Swooning, I sank in an abyss Of senselessness, until again He roused me with a burning kiss. How long embraced we sat, the while The hours fled past, I cannot tell: We took no thought of time. The spell Of the first love did sense beguile And made the world invisible. At last the white moon lifted up The screen of clouds; and through the veil Of linkèd leafage, pure and pale, She pour'd out from her argent cup Sapphires and pearl on hill and vale. Then, with a sigh, from our embrace We ceased; and in the path that led Homeward we went, with eyes that fed On eyes and hands that did enlace, Like doves within one nest-place laid. That night I slept not; for the bliss Of that new sweetness fill'd my brain With some strange ecstasy of pain; The splendid passion of his kiss Burnt on my lips and would not wane. Thence, day by day, we met: and none Gave heed unto the chain of gold That link'd our lives. Our hearts grew cold To all else breathed beneath the sun: We loved as gods in days of old. But one day came into the land An ancient man, who for a sword The carven cross of Christ the Lord Did bear within his palsied hand. Upon the wondering folk he pour'd The sorcery of his speech and bade All Christians harness them, to save From Paynim hands the blessed grave Wherein the Son of God was laid. And as they hearken'd, like a wave, The wonder of his words did course Through every heart and every brain. The whole land flock'd to him amain; And every warrior sprang to horse, And old men gripp'd their swords again. Then, as a tide, all men, whose arm Could wield a blade, rose up and bent Their way towards the Orient; And he, whose speech had wrought the charm, Singing, before the great host went. And with the others, Lautrec took His arms and rode unto the affray. One kiss: from out the dense array He turn'd and gave me one last look; And the crowd carried him away. The weary days went on and on, Dull with the tremor of dismay. At length, one dreary winter day, The news came that the host had won Jerusalem, whereas there lay The holy tombplace of the Lord: But many a valiant knight was laid Low underneath the olives' shade, Where like a sea the blood had pour'd Of Turk and Christian, and there sway'd The tide of battle doubtfully Full many a day; for stout and brave The Paynims were; and the cold grave Took many a tall knight for his fee, And many an one a captive slave Among the Infidels was led. And with the rest a slave or slain Was Lautrec. Often and amain His war-cry rang, until his head Went down; and none saw him again. The cruel news seem'd meaningless To me at first; my dazèd thought Could not conceive the woe it brought: But soon the full stern consciousness Within my brain to pain was wrought. Like some curst drug, the full despair Of love laid waste and life grown death Coursed through each vein: the very breath Of life seem'd burnt out of my air, And hope lay down to die with faith. The careless gossip of the court, The foolish wonder of the folk, That knew not what a thunderstroke Had stunn'd me, of my mind fell short; For in that moment my heart broke. Some sinew crack'd within my brain And life was turn'd to death for me: A vault of iron seem'd to be Closed round me and I strove in vain Athwart the gloom to hear and see. How long in death in life I lay, I know not; for all sense was dead And no thought throbb'd in heart or head; But all the stress of night and day Unheeded o'er my slumber sped. At last some glimmer of new sense Began to gather in my breast: Like birds returning to their nest, Thought struggled through the sheer suspense That had my hand and heart opprest. Then gradually the chains of sleep Relax'd their iron hold of me; And as they fell and left me free, As 'twere from out some darkling deep Arose the wraiths of memory. Remembrance rose in me again, But strangely veil'd and blunted so, I felt no sting of mortal woe Nor any anguish of past pain; My life to me was as a show Of spectral shapes, whereon I gazed With idle eyes and knew it not: The ancient anguish was forgot And all the passion, that had blazed In me, extinguish'd every jot. For all to me was but a theme For vague and aimless wondering: My thought chased memory with dull wing Along the mazes of a dream Nor could it once to parley bring. But, as I lay and ponder'd o'er The germs of thought confusedly, Hearing and sight came back to me By slow degrees, as from the shore Of some innavigable sea; And I was 'ware that I was laid, Corpselike, upon a gilded bier, Midmost a chapel. Far and near, Tall candles stood around and ray'd Out dimly through the darkness sheer, Like ghosts upon whose brow there shines The phosphorescence of the dead; And over all the walls were spread Hangings of sable, with the signs Of death in silver broiderèd. My hands were cross'd upon my breast And over me, to left and right, Were lilies scatter'd, gold and white: Upon my lids some cold thing prest And yet meseem'd I had my sight. The church was void, save for the flame And the still forms around that stood, Shapes carven out of stone and wood, Martyr and saint and halidame And Christ that hung upon the Rood. And I lay speechless and alone, Nor could avail to lift my head Nor loose my hands: a weight of lead Relentless chain'd me to the stone And something told me I was dead. And yet the knowledge brought no pain Unto my thought, that floated free Upon death's dim and stirless sea; But, as some faint and vague refrain, It murmur'd in the ear of me. A dull and meaningless content Folded my spirit: in the haze Of the unfathomable ways, I knew not even what death meant; I had no thought of worlds or days. There as I lay, one after one, The torches waned and flicker'd out; The shadows troop'd, a motley rout, Across the walls; then all was done And darkness compass'd me about. Before my face the chapel wall Was pierced with one great graven eye Of window, wherethorough the sky Show'd like a purple-colour'd pall, Strewn o'er the earth come near to die. There was no radiance in the night, Save of stars scatter'd far and few, That on the mournful heaven drew A tracery of silver light, Like tears upon a veil of blue. No other light was there; and yet A presage waver'd in the air: It seem'd as if on heaven's stair Spirits stood waiting, star-beset, For some weird wonder to draw near. Withal, as there I lay a-swoon, All gradually the air wax'd white With some strange pallor of affright And through the heavens the witch-pale moon Slid slowly up into the night. And suddenly my stone-cold feet Throbb'd with strange burnings, as it were A hand of flame o'er them did fare; Tongues of thin fire began to fleet Along my limbs and I was ware Of one long spear of silver light, That stole across the glass and smote My feet and through my body shot Darts in hell-flame burnt fierce and white: And still I lay and startled not. Then suddenly another ray Slid from the shield of fire, that stood In heaven, ruddy even as blood, And glared on me, — and took its way, Unhinder'd of the carven Rood, Straight to my heart and thence did creep Up to my face and on mine eyes Play'd with fork'd tongues of fire, snakewise; And then yet other rays did leap All over me. I strove to rise, But could not; for methought the moon Bound me with many a silver chain. My heartstrings throbb'd with shrillest pain; And in the passion of my swoon, It seem'd as if through every vein Torrents of fire ran shrivelling And burnt the old life out of me: Old thoughts and instincts seem'd to be Chased from me, with remembering; And in their stead, a surging sea Of instincts new and new desire Swell'd up in me: through heart and brain A spasm of ecstatic pain Pass'd. In that baptism of fire, Death died, and I was born again; But not to any human birth. The fierce desires in me that rose Were not of kith or kin with those That stir in men that walk the earth, Nor such as soul in heaven knows. My thoughts were such as have their room In fiendis' brain, that surge and swell In their curst thought for aye that dwell In flames of everlasting doom; My heart throbb'd with the hopes of hell. A passion of strange hunger burn'd Within my entrails and indeed My heart, methought, did burn and bleed With longings tiger-like; I yearn'd Upon some fearful thing to feed. What I knew not as yet: but soon, As fiercelier through heart and core The unrelenting rays did pour The philtres of the magic moon, The uninforméd passion tore Its veils of doubt. — Before my sight A kirkyard opened, where the dead Lay with white faces, overshed With ghostly silver of moon-light, And from their veins the blood ran red And stain'd the grass with stream on stream. Then, for the vision, my tense will Strain'd out to reach that awful rill And kneeling 'neath that ghastly gleam, Of human blood to drink its fill: But could not; for my hands were bound. And as I look'd and burnt with rage My hellish hunger to assuage, From out the heap of dead there wound A snake-like thread and on the page Of moonlit stone strange signs did write In characters of awful red; Spells such as wake the sheeted dead And draw the thunder through the night. And as I look'd thereon, I read, But knew not what the import, save That it was borne into my thought, (How I knew not) the charm was wrought To draw new victims to the grave, Each with the other's heart's blood bought. Still the moon sear'd me with her sight; And still I strove in vain to stir; And sterner aye and fiercelier Desire burnt in me; till the night Waned, and the spell waned, too, with her. Then, as the earliest morning grey Began to glimmer in the East, The moon waxed paler and there ceased Her fiery hands from me. Then day; And mine eyes left their bloody feast. Sleep fell on me again, such sleep As lies upon the damnèd dead, Who dream of horror and of dread, What while the demons vigil keep Till Doomsday thunder o'er their head. But gradually, within my dream, Another dream was born in me: Methought God's sunshine set me free From doom of dark and it did seem One knelt anigh on bended knee And gazed full sadly on my face, With eyes star-soft, eyes that I knew, Brimmed with full peace of heaven's hue; Wherein big tears did stand and chase Each other from their deeps of blue. Some angel of the dead delight Surely it was: yet could not I Recall its name. Then drawing nigh, It bent above my cheek death-white Its breast that heaved with many a sigh. And yet 'twas but a dream, methought. But as the face drew near to mine, A glow as of enchanted wine Slid through my veins: the red lips sought My brow and settled on my eyne: Then on my lips like balm of fire Descended.—Life leapt up in me To that hot chrism: suddenly My heart-strings sounded like a lyre With music of a living glee. The spell slid off from heart and brain; The seal that lay upon my sight Relax'd and to the morning white My glad eyes open'd once again: And as they drank the golden light, Through painted pane and oriel shed, Dazzled at first and seeing none For the new splendours of the sun, A great shout hurtled through my head, As of a people, all as one, Rejoicing in some wondrous grace. Then, looking round, I saw a crowd Of folk black-robed, but radiant-brow'd, That through the chapel's resonant space Clamour'd in triumph, long and loud. But who knelt weeping by my bier? Weeping for joy?—A war-worn knight, Bronzed with the Orient heaven's light: Eyes blue as heaven, when June shines sheer, And hair that glitter'd, burning bright As sheaves of summer. At his view, Thought seized me and remembering. Lost love came back on memory's wing: For well of old that face I knew, Those eyes and hair, that, ring on ring, Like twining tendrils of the vine, Curl'd to his shoulders. Open-eyed, I gazed upon him, stupefied With joy and wonderment divine; Then suddenly “Lautrec!” I cried (For it was he, indeed,) and threw My arms about his neck.—The array Of folk and all the light of day Faded, for, with that rapture new, Sense fail'd me and I swoon'd away. But, through the swoon, I felt his eyes Summon my soul back from the deep Of death; my spirit sprang to steep In that dear dream of Paradise And in his arms I fell asleep. The days are blank for me that past Until the day when we were wed. Like as the lightning's lurid red Blots out the lamplight, so the blast Of hellish doom, that on my head Fell in that night of fate and fear, Effaced the golden memories Of days that lapsed like summer seas Under the blue of heaven clear, Blown over of the fragrant breeze. But oh! with what a charact'ry Of burning memories, despair, Link'd with remorse, has stamp'd for e'er That night's long horror upon me! When, with my foot on heaven's stair, Hell hurled me down the deeps of doom. There lives no snake in nether fire So merciless as waste desire; No demon in hell's lurid gloom As memory is half so dire. Our wedding-day had come and sped, Through happy gold of summertide, To eve: and now the night spread wide Her cloak of purple round the bed Where Love and I lay side by side. The lisp of lute-strings smitten soft, Hymning the golden allegresse Of wedded love, the silver stress Of choral songs—that soar'd aloft Till all the air was one caress Of silken sound—had died away. A spell of silence held the night, Broken of nothing save the light Rustle of leaves and breeze at play And drip of dews from heaven's height. The nightingale upon the tree Did with her summer-sacring note Hallow our happiness. By rote All that Love knows of sweet did she Pour hourlong from her honey'd throat. The kisses of the summer air, Laden with spiceries of Ind, Came floating on the flower-breathed wind: Through the wide casement, free and fair, The summer night upon us shined. And in the perfect peace of sound, The running ripples of the stream Like harpings afar off did seem To bear the bird-songs, as it wound Along the meadows, all agleam With diamonds of the dreaming stars, That glitter'd, jewell'd in the blue Of that sweet night of summer new: There look'd no light from heaven's bars, Save their soft cressets flickering through. The passion of the first delight Of lives new-knit had swoon'd away, And languid with Love's passion-play, Deep in a dream of life and light, Asleep beside me Lautrec lay. But I, for rapture of new bliss, Cared not to sink into the deep Delicious lap of that sweet sleep That follows Love, lest I should miss Some ecstasy or leave to reap Some delicate delights of thought, That spring like flower-flakes of the May From Love fulfilled and fade away, As blossoms of the sea-foam wrought, That melt into the sunny spray. My eyes stir'd not from Lautrec's face, That lay upturn'd toward mine own, As 'twere some sculptured saint of stone. With memories of the last embrace His rose-red mouth and forehead shone. How fair he seem'd to me! So fair, As I bent over him and fed My thirsty sight on him, the dread Of some vague misery somewhere, Envying our fortune, in my head Rose like the tremulous faint fear, That in full tide of August sun Across the scented air doth run, Foreboding thunders drawing near And levins ere the day be done. And more especially my sight Sate on the glory of his throat: With fondling fingers did I note The part where it was left milkwhite And that whereon the full sun smote And burnt its pallor golden brown. Then, as my toying hand withdrew The coverlet of gold and blue From off his breast and creeping down, Did nestle in his bosom true, I saw—whereas the royal line Of his fair throat met with the snow Of the broad breast and curving slow, Blended—a crescent purpurine, That on the milky flesh did glow, Like angry birth of harvest moon: 'Twas where some cruel sword had let Well nigh the life out. But I set My lips unto it, half a-swoon For thinking of the cruel fret Of pain that there had throbb'd whilere. And as I kiss'd the scarce heal'd scar, A dim foreboding, faint and far, Rose through my rapture, seeing there The image of the midnight star. A presage faint and far it was: For no remembrance woke in me Of that long blank of agony: But vague thoughts over me did pass Of doom, as on some summer sea A swell of distant tempest heaves, Whilst yet the azure of the sky Shines fleckless and the sea-flowers lie Slumbering within their folded leaves; And yet afar the storm draws nigh. The omens grew; and as I lay, Meseem'd a change took everything: The nightingale had ceased to sing; The face of night grew cold and grey And many a night-bird on shrill wing Swept past the casement, with strange cries That froze the heart in me for fear. Across the heavens blue and clear A veil of mist-wreaths seem'd to rise And blot the stars with darkness sheer. 'Twas as the weaving, still and slow, But sure as death, of some dire spell, That over heaven and earth should swell And gather, till all things below Should grovel in the grasp of Hell. The spell wax'd aye; and suddenly, Across my stupor, I was ware Of some new horror in the air; The dusk was sunder'd and a sea Of light pour'd through it everywhere. A ghastly mimicry of noon Flooded the sky: and full in sight, As 'twere a shield of blood-red light, The lurid visage of the moon Leapt out into the affrighted night. A shriek of horror in my throat Rose; but no sound to my lips came. I strove to hide me from the flame Of the curst star, that seem'd to gloat Upon the prey it came to claim. But on my hands a weight of lead Press'd and my limbs refused to stir. Then, one by one, athwart the air, The moon put forth her hands of dread, Snake-like, and bound me fast to her. A flood of fire blasted my brain: Unceasingly the fiery dew Of that stern spell rush'd ravening through Conduit and artery and vein, Till once again in me there grew An awful birth of doom, that drove Thought from me of all things that were And all life has of pure and fair, Effaced all memories of Love, Hope and compassion and despair, And fill'd me with a ghastly glee, A fierce and fiendish gladsomeness, That, in the hideous caress Of the moon waxing momently, Swell'd up to madness. Then the stress Of that hell's hunger I had known First in the chapel through my brain Struck like a levin. Once again I saw the kirkyard corpse-bestrown, With red blood running from each vein: And with the vision, my desire Soar'd into fury of foul lust For blood, it seem'd as if I must Assuage, although into hell-fire For ever after I were thrust. The thought of love was burnt away By that foul passion and forgot. Fiercelier and faster the moon shot Upon me ray on lurid ray, Until (but how meknoweth not), All suddenly, my parch'd lips clave To Lautrec's throat and in the scar, That did its fair perfection mar, So fiercely delved, that like a wave The bright blood spouted, fast and far, An arch of crimson.—Still he slept; For over all the night were strewn The curst enchantments of the moon: And as the hot blood through me swept, My sense shook off its leaden swoon And with parch'd throat I drank my fill Of that fell stream. Then, as I stay'd My awful hunger, undismay'd, There rose within me higher still That horrid gladness and there play'd Full streams of fire through every vein. The darkling majesty of Hell Within my breast did surge and swell: The infernal rapture brimm'd my brain With ecstasy ineffable. Each limb and nerve seem'd born anew And every separate faculty Retemper'd in that fiery sea: In baptism of blood there grew Another heart and soul in me: The heart and spirit of a fiend, That in all things which live and are Seeks but God's handiwork to mar. At dugs of death my soul was yean'd Anew, beneath the midnight star. I trod in thought the flaming shore Of that unfathomable sea, Wherein both damn'd and demons be; Stood, crown'd with fire, upon Hell's floor And strain'd exultant eyes to see The damn'd folk writhing in the gloom; Whilst, all around me, from the throng Arose the immeasurable song Of fiends exulting in their doom, With hideous hymnings, loud and long. Still the moon glared on me; and still, O'ermastered of the fatal ray, With lips that drain'd his life away, Of Lautrec's blood I drank my fill; And still immovable he lay. But life ebb'd fast from him the while: His face put on a livid hue And the moon, falling on him, drew His features to a seeming smile, Dreadful with death that pierced it through. Yet I at that unholy feast Lay, with tranced sense that heeded not The ghastly tremors which denote Death's drawing nigh, — till the moon ceased And faded from me, mote by mote. The vanward banners of the dawn Dappled the Eastward. In the sky A thin grey line of light grew high; And gradually all the dark was drawn Together, as the stars did die And night left heaven to the day. Then, as on me the earliest stroke Of sun athwart the casement broke, The hellish sorcery drew away From off my spirit and I woke Unto my doom: and as my sight Drank in that scene of death and dread And the corpse lying on the bed, Life faded out from me forthright And dead I lay by Lautrec dead. No more I knew, until the moon Roused me once more within the bier. Since then, each night, when she shines clear, My body from the chill corpse-swoon Startles and in the moonlight sheer, Across the sleeping earth I go, Seeking anew to sate my thirst Upon fresh victims, as at first: So, till the Judgment-trumpets blow, To roam the night I am accurst. But lo! the shimmer in the sky! She comes, the Queen of night and hell! The grave-grip looses me; the spell Of death is slackening. Full and high She grows. Ah, there her first rays fell Across the painted window-pane! And see, her stern face surges slow And fills the chapel with its glow: Onward it creeps, onward amain, Till on my tomb its full tides flow. Ah, there at last full on mine eyes The thaumaturgic splendours shone, Across the crannies of the stone! All hail, my mistress! I arise And in my grave-clothes stand alone. Then, as the white hermetic fire Streams in my veins, portal and wall Before my rushing footsteps fall And ravening with red desire, I scatter death in hut and hall. THE MASQUE OF SHADOWS. “La mort contient l'espérance infinie.” Leconte de Lisle. PILED earth above my head did lie, And from my sight the flower-blue sky Was hidden by a waste of stone; And I in earth was left alone, To search the secrets of the tomb. Waste night was there and speechless gloom, And I thought not nor wonderéd Nor groped into the dusk with dread; For Death had crown'd me with a crown Of Lethe-weeds, that bound me down In opiate trances. In a swoon Of death I lay, wherein the moon Seem'd spread above me like a flower, That glitters in the midnight hour Above the glass of some strange lake, And from it falling dews did slake My yearning for the coming things. Meseem'd my soul had lost its wings And could not lift itself away From out that prison-place of clay. Strange peace possess'd me and content; Meseem'd the springs of wonderment And fear were lapsed from me with death, And with the 'scape of earthly breath Desire was dead of heart and brain. The memories of joy and pain Had in the life that goes before The change of being, at the core Of that great darkness, glimmer'd yet, In characters of silver set Against the gloom; but in my breast Their scroll-work was a palimpsest Whereon no writing, bright or dark, Did burn. My soul their forms did mark, As one that looks upon a masque With absent eyes, too dull to ask Of what these shadows told and whom: Death fill'd me so, there was no room For aught that unto life pertain'd. And so the ages came and waned (Meseem'd) and in a sleep of sound And sight, I lay within the ground, Lapt in a trance of senselessness. So hard the stillness seem'd to press Upon me, that methought I sank, Athwart the centre black and dank, A fathom deep with every age, Passing strange seas that still did rage In silence; caverns in the rock, Wherein pent gases for the shock Of earthquakes lay engarner'd up; Red fires, that boil'd within a cup Of adamant, and grisly shapes, That mopp'd and mow'd like devils' apes As I sank past them, like a stone That to the deepest deeps is thrown Of some dull ocean. Here the ground Shook with the phantom of a sound, As if some cataract of flame Roar'd down the channels without name That tunnel all the middle world: And here strange midworld thunders hurl'd And echo'd, beating back the sound With livid jets of light, that wound And leapt and crawl'd, like hell-fire snakes A-pastime. Now I pass'd grim lakes, Whereon a silence horrible Did brood, and from the darkness fell Into the pool great gouts of blood And redden'd all the grisly flood With lurid flakes. And then again I fell and fell, athwart a rain (Methought) of stars, that long had lost, For some old sin, the glittering ghost That lit their orbits,—white and pale, Prick'd out against the grave-grey veil Of the stern darkness, like a flight Of moths against an Autumn night, Spectral and sad. And now a roar Of hollow-moaning torrents tore The ghastly calm, and white wild waves Rent up the crannied midworld caves About me: and I saw afar A phosphorescence like a star Floating above the grey abyss Of waters, as a soul that is Doom'd to dim wanderings o'er the sea Of some unterm'd eternity. And as I sank, I felt the throng Of waves beneath me, and along The lightless caverns I was borne Betwixt harsh flaming rocks, betorn With clash of waves and billows' war, Toward the ever fleeting star, Set in its mystic veils of gloom. Roars rent the earth in all her womb, As, bearing me, the torrent fled Past all the seats of quick and dead In the red centre; and the core Of the huge mountains, that upbore The pinnacles of heaven, groan'd With the fierce pain: the black rocks moan'd And all the deeps cried out for rage And terror. Still, for many an age, Methought the stream fell evermore, And I with it, athwart the roar Of clashing powers,—and still the light Fled farther through the hideous night, Above the grisly torrent-flow And the rock-cataracts. And so, For centuries I fell and fell Past all the flaming mouths of hell, Until at last meseem'd the spell Of sleep that bound me stronger grew, As 'twere grim hands of darkness drew Curtains of bronze about my sense; And all the shadow waxed so dense, That sight and hearing utterly Were for a time bereft from me, And I was soulless for a space. Then suddenly the swart embrace Of night was slack'd and all the chains Of blackness loosed me. So, with pains Unutterable, sense tore back Into my brain and with the rack, I felt that I had ceased to fall. Then, gazing up through shroud and pall, I saw the coffin-lid had grown Translucent as the silver stone That moulds the flanges of the moon: And through the lid, a light was strewn Upon my face, such as is shed From many a body of the dead, Night-raised beneath the starless sky For curséd witchcraft. And as I Strove tow'rd the glimmer, I was ware That all the bands that bound me there Had loosed my limbs and every sense Was free from thrall: the cerements Slid off, as mists fall from the day, And up I stood, a phantom grey And awful, in the dim blue gloom. The place was like some old god's tomb, Built high with grisly walls and ceil'd With a black dome-work, like a shield Of iron bossed with ebony: And there no thing the eye could see, Save the gray walls and the pale light, That seem'd as 'twere the corpse of night, Rotted to phosphorescency: But, as I paced it endlessly About the dismal place, that shone With that strange glitter,—blue and wan With my long tomb-sleep,—there was shown To me a postern in the stone, Built low within the wall to mock A slit tomb-opening in the rock Deep hewn. I push'd the portal through, And as I strove, the glimmer grew From out the darkness concentrate Into blue globes of fire and fate And on the lintel in the gloom Did grave strange signs of awe and doom, In unknown mystic tongues that write Runes in the bowels of the night. The postern open'd, and I past Into a place all weird and ghast With one eternal emptiness: There was no living thing to bless The grim dead waste of that sad scape With any sign of life or shape. Wave after wave, like a pale sea Fix'd by some fearful sorcery To semblant earth, the grey waste spread, As limitless as to the dead The death-swoon seems, within a shroud Of silentness. Above, a cloud Of vapours, twisted as it were By winds long died out of the air, Hung like an imminence of doom: One felt that never on that gloom Had Heav'n's breath fallen nor to all Eternity should ever fall. Then was my spirit sore dismay'd By that weird voidness, all outlaid Before me, like a dead world's ghost; And back I turn'd me, having lost All wish for going and desire, Save in the grave to rest from fire And imminence of mystery. But, as I groped about to see The backward way, behold, the door Was disappear'd, and there no more Was any opening in the grey Of the grim rampire. Then away Out of my soul the dull fear past, And with swift steps into the vast Grey lapses of the plain I went: And as I sped, my thought was blent With a strange lightness of desire, That seem'd to draw me ever nigher To some completion of my spright. Wings fail'd me not: I was so light Of going that I seem'd to float Upon the greyness, like a boat Of mid-air souls, that in the night Is borne upon the waves of light That ripple round the trancéd moon. About me lay the night, aswoon With second death, so still it was,— Save now and then a mote would pass Of strange-hued light, and in the mote Meseem'd pale presences did float Of unknown essence. Blue and weird, They rose on me and disappear'd Into the dusk, and suddenly I was aware that I did flee In a blue vapour, luminous With my soul's glimmer, like to those That fleeted past me. On and on I flitted through the darkness wan; And ever thicker swarm'd the motes, Like to some shining mist that floats Above a marish,—and anon, Meseem'd some phantom brightlier shone A second's space, as it drew nigh Some other flame, and momently The twain went, circling round and round Each other, o'er the grisly ground, Striving, it seem'd, to meet; but ever Some viewless hand their loves did sever, And with a shock of rent desires, They leapt asunder. Then tall spires Of flaming bronze rose zenith-high Upon the marges of the sky, And round the flames I saw grey things That hover'd on their filmy wings About the turrets, circle-wise, Striving, methought, tow'rd heav'n to rise On the fierce flood of fire, that bore The skyward spikes, but evermore The frail wings fail'd them, scorch'd away By the red flame; and yet the essay Renewing ever, from the ground They struggled up and circled round The pitiless spirals, but again To be hurl'd earthward in a rain Of passionate fire-flakes. Still I fled Across that desert of the dead And past the towers, that burnt aloft Like fixt flames, till the air grew soft With some strange melody, that rose Out of the gloom, with close on close Of sad and vaporous harmony: One might not tell if it should be The dim wild wail of sprites forlorn Or some weird waftings, upward borne, Of perfume from ghost-flowers of night, So blended all its sad delight Was with the measures of a song And the mute harmonies that throng And hover o'er a night-flower's cup: And as its phrases waver'd up, Ineffable, from out the night And its weird silences, each light Leant to the cadence, and across The air, the pulse harmonious Compell'd the ghost-motes to a maze Of intertwisted rhythmic ways, A measure of strange guise, wherein The rhythms of the song were twin With those that sleep in light and those That in the perfumes of the rose Throb dumbly aye, by some strange stress Evoked from out their silentness To vaguest life. It seem'd to me, The sad strange dance's mystery Involved all sorrows and all fears, All ecstasies of hopes and tears, And all the yearning that survives To the grey ghosts from bygone lives And lives to come, if such shall be, Fore-cast by stress of memory: A rhythm, slow and interlaced With trails of pause, as if thought chased A long-loved memory through a maze Of desert passion-tangled ways, For ever hopelessly, and ne'er Might win to grasp the vision fair And piteous. And as I gazed Upon the dances, unamazed, For voidness of a ghost's desire, A strange faint perfume did aspire Through all my sense, and with the scent There came a sudden ravishment Of dead desires, and there did seize Upon me all old memories And all the tyrannies of thought, A sheaf of all life's shorn threads wrought To some weird web of wishful pain. The impulses, that from my brain Had faded out with life, came back With the old eddying whirl and rack Of imminent longing; and the song, Meseem'd, in all its closes long And soft, exhaled my very soul And all its melodies of dole And striving, wafted through the gate Of death, — ah, how most sublimate And shadowy! And no less, methought, In all the rhythm there was wrought For me a sense of winding feet And hands stretch'd floatingly to meet Celestial hands, — of spiral flames Wavering up aye toward vague aims Of rest and spirit-peace fulfill'd: And with the passion sad and still'd Of those weird measures, all my sense Vibrated, like a lyre-string, tense And shaken by a summer wind, Until the influences did bind My senses to a following Of their strange rhythm and did bring My will within some mystic spell Of motion, potent to compel The uncorpsed essence. So the law Of that sad ecstasy did draw My spright to it, and wavering, I circled in that mystic ring Of song and colour and perfume, Athwart the wide, unbroken gloom, In a still frenzy of content, A sad harmonious ravishment Of wan delights. It seem'd to me The very passionless harmony Of aspiration tow'rd the aim My soul alive could never name, Much less attain to, fill'd the deeps Of my void yearning with dim sleeps Of Autumn-colour'd seas, that lay And sway'd above the iron grey Of the grim ocean-bed and lull'd The monsters there to slumber, dull'd With melodies monotonous; Save one stern thought, that ever was Implacable, a snake of Fate, In the mid-cavern deeps await To fix its stings into my heart And rend my being with the smart Of its fell fangs, lashing the foam To tempest. So my spright did roam In those song-govern'd wanderings, And the flower-breathings from the strings Of my stretch'd soul drew wave on wave Of sighing music, faint and grave As the sad ghost-light, 'mid that throng Of glimmering presences; how long Meknoweth not; until, meseem'd, Upon the far sky-marge there gleam'd A reddening glimmer and there ceased Some dele the greyness from the east Of that sad plain, as 'twere the gloom Had for long dint of death become Half phosphorescent. Through the grey The shadow-dawn came, — such a day! There is no saddest autumn night, Grey with the end of the grey light, That could its pallor call to mind. It was as if a worldward wind Brought up from sea-tombs far away The shadow-ghost of some dead day, Long hidden in the shrouds of years, A day made pale with many tears And many a memory of affright. The shadow-sun rose, ashen-white, From out the shadow-deeps below, As 'twere a star dead long ago And waked to ghost-life in a swoon, Beneath the sorcery of the moon; And as its whiteness wan and chill Slid through the void, the air grew still: The mystic measures did forsake The rhythm of the dance: there brake The charm of scents that did compel My spell-bound senses and there fell A witchery of silentness Upon the plains. Then, press on press, A mist of dreams rose wavering Out of the earth, and everything Changed aspect. All the waste did take The semblance of a shadowy lake, With shores of marish, set with reeds And armies of grey-flowering weeds. Across the dull unmirroring face Of the sad flood did interlace A countless multitude of flowers, As colourless as winter hours: Great flaccid irises, that erst, (I dreamed), in life's long summery burst Had flamed with many a bell of blue, Mocking the August-tided hue Of the sweet sky, or sweltered up From the clear lake with many a cup Of pers and inde imperial, But now were grey and hueless all, Phantoms in that phantasmal air Of bygone sweets: and too were there Strange pallid lilies, sad and wide, Streak'd with dull flakes of grey and pied With ghosts of many long-dead hues: And from the flowers accursèd dews Stream'd up in mists towards the light. And as I gazed, their scent did smite Upon my sense and I was ware That those curst bells the phantoms were Of the rich summer-tide of flowers, That, in its golden-threaded hours, The passion of my soul pour'd out From its fresh song-spring. Past a doubt I knew the blossoms of my Spring And the rich summer's flowering Of gold and azure, ay, no less, The autumn's blaze of restlessness And the dim winter's flowers of snow, — And all my heart did overflow With bitterness, to see even these Lie in the hueless shadow-peace, Dead and ghost-pale: for I had long Gladden'd myself, that this my song Should never die, but 'mid the death, Day after day, that cumbereth The fine-strung soul, had comforted My failing hope with the sweet thought, (When this my hopelessness was sped,) That these my flowers, that I had wrought With pain and urgence of duresse, Should bloom unsullied from the press Of world-worn lives and spare for aye My purest part from Time's decay. Full long and sadly did I gaze Upon them with a drear amaze; For with remembrance had return'd The pangs of all the years I burn'd Toward an unattainèd goal, Receding ever, — till my soul Was stirred by a new wonderment And from my sense the ghostly scent Before a fresh impress did flee: For there was wroughten suddenly A new enchantment from the veils Of the drawn mists and all the sails Veer'd thither of my soul. About The marish-borders started out A maze of buildings of a dream; Ranges of steads, that all did gleam With white fantastic porticoes; High temples, with pale ghostly shows Of colonnades and peristyles, Prolong'd and join'd for unknown miles, In maddening endless countlessness. Grey cloister did on cloister press, Far stretching on through devious ways Into the intermittent haze That closed the distance. Through the veil Of mists, thin pinnacles did scale The midmost heaven with mazy spires, Round which, like ways of men's desires, The cloisters strove toward the sky. It seem'd one vast infinity Of netted ways, most desolate And awful in their silent state, Their shadeless symmetry of white: For, of a verity, one might Throughout their solemn mystery Wander a long eternity And never come to find the end, Whereto the devious ways did tend In their dim silence-folded heart. Then, as I stood a space apart, No little wondering, from the lake The mists that hover'd up did take In the dawn-glimmer shadow-shape And in pale semblances did drape Their shimmery essence. All the air Was full of ghosts, that down the stair Of the pale light troop'd from the shore And the curst marish to the core Of the unending shadow-town. Throng after throng they lighted down, And in grey hosts funereal, Dispersed in every cloister'd hall, They flitted through the endless aisles Of those void mazes, — miles on miles, Wandering as 'twere with hopeless eyes And outstretch'd eager hands, mere sighs Of yearning tow'rd some darling thing, For which even death could never bring The death of longing: and meseem'd Each of the shadowy folk, that stream'd Along the cloisters, 'twixt the walls Of mist, had, in the shadow-halls Of the dead dreams, been known of me. Methought, in each some fragrancy Of my own unfulfill'd desire Was prison'd, — and with straining hands, I strove toward them: but the bands Of some stern Fate did bind my will And held me solitary still. But, as I stood and wept for pain Of my void yearning, o'er the plain Of weeds and flowers, a low chill breeze Rose mutely and on me did seize With all its fluttering hands of wind: So that my semblance, all entwined With airy pinions, it did raise And waft across the still lake-ways, Like some thin down of daffodil Or windflower ravish'd up, until It set me in the midmost court Of the vast halls, wherefrom, athwart The stillness, all the soundless ways Fill'd the grey vistas with a maze Of column'd arches. Then the breeze Ceased softly from the misted leas, And in void wonder I remain'd. Awhile, in a strange calm, enchain'd By some vague sense of coming Fate, Mute in the centre court I sate And watch'd with absent eyes the flights Of that pale crowd of eager sprights Athwart the desert columnings: And now and then, from unseen strings And pipes, soft sighs exanimate Of music made the air vibrate With vaporous rhythms and there fell The harmonies ineffable Of spirit-psalms upon my ear. And so, through many a lapsing year, Meseem'd, I sat nor cared arise, Until betwixt those songful sighs There swell'd upon my ghostly sense A breath of mystic ravishments, Such as had waved about my thought, When in the worldly life I wrought My wish to palaces of dreams, Sun-gilded by no earthly beams, In visions sweet and intricate. It seem'd as if some flower of fate, For this my secret set apart, Breathed out to me its inmost heart In trails of perfume, to express My unform'd longing, — with such stress Of sympathy it seem'd to speak To me. And as I turn'd to seek The mystic power, that did fulfil My wish with perfume, — on the sill Of a low arch, through which a scape Of aisles began, I saw a shape, Array'd in star-prick'd robes of mist, Soft sapphire and pale amethyst And every tender mystic hue Of emblem'd sadness, and I knew A white dream-haunted face and eyes Brimm'd with blue shadowy memories, A sad sweet mouth, that had alone In the dim vision-ways been shown To my desire. It was, meseem'd, The perfectness of all I dream'd, The gathering from strife and storm Of all my lost ones, in the form Of a fair woman-ghost revealed. And as I gazed on her, eye-seal'd With ravishment, the fair shape came Toward me, like a mingled flame Of white and blue, till I could see Her ghostly beauty perfectly. There was a light of dim dead grace, A wild waste beauty in her face, That told of very tender love In that sweet world that is above Our place of shadows, — love and grief Bounden together in one sheaf By Death in his pale harvesting. In her, dead Love had taken wing Out of the ruins of the past, A sky-pure thing, that all had cast Its chrysalis in the grave-hush. Then, at her sight, my soul did rush To her embraces, as assured In her the weakness should be cured Of its uncompassèd desire; But she, like a pale lambent fire Borne by the wind across the glass Of some still marish-pool, did pass Out of my reach, within the throat Of the grey portal, and did float Along the cloisters tremulously, Beckoning with backward hand to me To follow. Then did I ensue The steps of that fair spirit, through A maze of many palaces, Builded, it seem'd, with mockeries Of gold and jewels, that had long Lost their glad soul of light among The cypress-ways of death, — through halls Of cunning fretwork, where the walls Were hung with arras, that of old Had glow'd with blazon'd pearl and gold And all sweet colours that one sees In the fair dream-embroideries, Wrought by no earthly skill to sheen And shape of beauty that has been, Fair histories of heroic times Gone by and tales from poets' rhymes; But now, alas! the radiant spright Had from the webwork taken flight And of their braveries was left Only a grey and filmy weft Of shadowy outlines, toss'd about By the sad airs, like some still rout Of old-world spectres. And anon, As I went on and ever on Betwixt the arras all wind-blown, Pale shadows of old feasts were thrown Across the many vistaed ways, And banner'd pageants did blaze And wind along the weed-weft aisles. Anon ghost-music rose the whiles, Rhythms of erst-glad melody, Measures, whose soul had been of old A summer-dream of blue and gold, But now was paled and blanched to be Void wails of sorrow unconsoled And voices of a vague remorse. And often, as upon the course Of the fair shade, I took my way, There started spectres from the grey Of the pale halls and hemm'd me round With shadow-dances. From the ground The memories of things gone by Aspired before me endlessly, And all the passion of the past Rose up around me, wan and ghast With the long death-swoon, and did mock My forward longing with a flock Of jeering phantoms, mute as Fate. In every nook the wraiths did wait To spring upon me: from the roofs, Thick with void ghosts of gems, grey woofs Of worldly-worn desires did flutter About my head and there did mutter From all the caves of echoings A ceaseless flight of murmurous things, Wing'd with dead thoughts melodious. The phantom footfalls did arouse, As we swept on, a shadow-burst Of my waste song-shapes, interspersed With bleeding semblants of the souls I had outwrought from my own doles And joys and vestured in a part Of flesh torn from my bleeding heart. These all from silence started out To life and circled me about With an unceasing rout of ghosts: And evermore new shadow-hosts Grew from the mystic gloom, array'd In trails of shadowy raiment, made Of all my bygone hopes and fears. And still, as I did fare, for tears And weariness nigh past desire, That lovely shade to me drew nigher And with soft eyes and finger-sign Beckon'd me on. Strange lights did shine Through vault and cloister, and anon A phosphorescence, blue and wan, Shimmering across the shadow-steads, Show'd where great giants raised their heads Of shadow to the middle air: And kings and heroes, very fair And dreadful, sat in ghostly state Upon vast thrones, stern shapes of Fate, More awful than a man shall tell, Majestic and immoveable. Now on a cloister'd space we came, Where, like pale pyramids of flame, Strove up to heaven the shining weeds Of all most bright and noble deeds That men in life have dream'd to do; And in the cloisters, stretching through From hall to hall, on either hand, Dim luminous semblances did stand; And round the cornice, like a frieze, Were shadow'd out all phantasies, Gracious and awful, that on earth The thought of man has given birth Or dream-built harmony unto, Death-paled from all their wealth of hue And all the passion of their youth. And as I pass'd them by, the ruth That did possess me at their view Took shape within me and I knew, In all that grey and shadowy state Of dreams and semblants etiolate, The phantoms of the unreal sheen, That glorifies the “Might have been.” Long did we traverse without cease That awful maze of palaces; And still, whene'er my soul did faint For the sad stress of some dead plaint, The ghost of gladness past, or, pale With agony, desire did fail, For all the horror of the task And the grey terror of that masque Of shadow-spectres, that for e'er Did harass me with ghosts of care And memories,—that fairest shade The torment of my spright allay'd With her soft shadowy azure gaze; And still I strove along the ways Behind her and could reach her not. So we for endless years, methought, Did fare, and never could I win To fold her form my arms within; It seem'd to me, the films of air, That parted us, of crystal were, As pitiless as diamond, Forbidding me to come beyond The line that did our lives divide. And ever, as the ages died And no hope came to my desire Of its fruition, the pale fire Of longing, that at first had seem'd But as a flicker, burn'd and beam'd Within my soul to such a height Of aspirance, that with its light My ghostly semblance, grey and wan, Grew glorious as a star and shone With splendour of desireful love And all my being flamed above The greyness of the lower air. And that shade, too, the pale and fair, Put on like splendour of desire And in like brightness ever higher Flamed up athwart the shadow-rout And the pale cloisters, sheathed about With fire celestial. So there past Long centuries, until at last My eyes were open'd from the ring Of mine own wish and suffering And to my new-born sight appear'd, Against the sky-rack grey and weird, Myriads of souls, that like a fire Burnt higher up and ever higher Toward the troubled firmament. And as I gazed, the air was rent With a great singing, as it were The resonance of a great prayer And joy for a great ransom won; And with the shock of it upon The embattled air, the veils were torn From the ceiled sky and there was borne Upon my sense a great delight, A flowering of awful light: For there did pass across the heaven A sword of flaming gold, and riven Were all the glooms from south to north And the great radiance burst forth Of midmost heaven upon us all. And from the firmament did fall A rain of heavenly fires, that brake The crystal walls from us and strake The mists to splendour. Then did we Each upon each in ecstasy Rush in the ending of desire, And in that sacrament of fire, All grossness of vain hope fell off From the pure essence and with love And gladness purged, the perfect spright Rose up into the realms of light, Death and its mystery solved at last. And so with many a song we past Into the deepest deeps of blue, A dual soul, that like a dew Dissolved into the eternity That rounds all being like a sea. LIGHT O' LOVE. WE dwelt within a wood of thought, I and my days; and no man sought Or cared to comfort us in aught. A strange sad company we were, Calm with the quiet of despair, As sunset in the autumn air. No thing we had nor cared to win Of all for which men toil and spin: We took no kind of joy therein. Nor any glimpse to us was given Of that for which we once had striven, The love that likens earth with heaven. But some strange spell was wound about Our lives, a charm of hope and doubt, That severed us from lives without; A charm that was not weft of flowers Of night alone or winter hours,— This binding gramarye of ours,— But grew of delicate sweet blooms That, found of old in woodland glooms, Had drawn us from the waste world-rooms To seek the singing solitudes, Where some unforced enchantment broods And never any foot intrudes. There, drinking deep of dews that fell And sparkled in some woodflower's bell, Made potent with a drowsy spell, The charm on us had taken hold And like a mist about us rolled, The pale dreams wavered white and cold; A mist of charms that spread between Us and the world, so that, I ween, We were not heard of men or seen. But folk passed by and knew us not: And day by day, the fatal lot A stronger hold upon us got; Until the sighs and tears we spent About us for bewilderment Did fructify, and earth was sprent Around us with a flush of flower Sad-hued; and tall dusk trees did tower And clung about us like a bower. So that, one day, when we awoke, I and my days, and would have broke The dream and let the gold sun-stroke Into our lives, the outward way Was set with hawthorns white and grey And trees that shouldered back the day. And from the world of men there came Nor sound of bell nor sight of flame, And no man called us by our name. But outerward we heard the roll Of daily life through joy and dole And pleasant labour; but no soul Strayed from the highway or the mart To where within the wild wood-heart I and my days we sat apart. Then to my days I said, “Behold, The memory of our life is cold And no man knows us as of old. “Shall we go forth and seek for grace? Lo, men have all forgot our face: Another sitteth in our place. “Let us sit down again, my days, Here where our dreams have built a maze Of flowers for us and woodland ways. “For of a surety no thing Shall profit us of sorrowing, Nor strife can comfort to us bring. “Here will we sit and let the sweep Of life go by: in this wood-deep, Our dreams shall carol us to sleep.” Then, in that pleasant woodland-shade, I and my days full fain we made A dwelling-place and therein stayed. Most fair that forest was and full Of birds and all things beautiful; And many a pleasant green-set pool Was there, where fawns came down to drink At eventide and on the brink The nodding cuckoo-bells did blink. By one of these, thick-bowered among A nest of hawthorns, all a-throng With birds that filled the air with song, We builded us a dwelling-place, Set in a little sun-screened space, Midmost the forest's dreamy grace. And there full many a day we spent, Lost in a dream of dim content, I and my days, what while there went Without the many-coloured hours, Golden or sad. With flush of flowers We calendared this life of ours. For many a precious thing and fair We had heaped up and garnered there, And many a jewel bright and rare; And of a truth our hands were full Of memories most beautiful And dreams whose glitterance did dull Remembered sunlight in our thought: So rich we were, that memory brought No yearning for the world in aught. And too, each one of these my days Had, wandering in the wild wood-ways, Caught from the birds some note of lays More sweet than waking ears can deem Or in the mazes of the dream Had found some gem of all that teem Within the mystery of thought, Some pearl of hidden arts, or caught Some strange sweet secret, all inwrought With scent of leaves and forest-flowers And glitter of enchanted showers Fallen athwart the sunset-towers. And all the wonders of the wood And all the pleasance that did brood Within that silver solitude, Jewelled with cups of gold and blue And veined with waters cleaving through The live green of the leafage new, Some one of these could bring to sight. One led to where, like living light, The clearest thread of streams took flight Across the mosses and could tell The hour when on the water fell The shadow of some mystic spell That called the hidden nymphs to sight And from the dell-deeps, in the night, The wood-girls flashed out, tall and white, Across the moonbeams; or the time, When through the birds' sunsetting chime The glades rang with the tinkling rhyme Of the wild wood-folk: and one knew Where such a flush of violets grew, That therewithal the earth was blue. And yet another one could show The wood-nooks where the blue-bells blow And banks are sweet with lily-snow. And one had heard the wild bird sing— In some dim close, where in a ring The apple-trees together cling— So sweet a song, it seemed the breath Of souls that know not life nor death, In fields where Heaven's Spring flowereth. And one, the youngest of them all, Had heard the elf-dance rise and fall, Where with the moon the woodbind-wall Shines silver in the wood-glooms deep: And one had seen the white nix leap, When the blue water lay asleep. And one had caught the mystic tune The sea sings underneath the moon, When earth with Summer lies aswoon. And one had lit by fairy grace, Wandering afield, upon a place Where, if a man shall lie a space And slumber in the flower-swaths dim, The sweet dreams whisper love to him, Till night burns dawn-red at the rim. And yet another, wandering, Had found the caves where rubies cling To earth and many a precious thing Of jewelries burns manifold, Within the darkness, and the mould Is spangled with the dust of gold. And some had trod the secret ways Where in the dusk the sun's lost rays Harden into the diamond's blaze; And threading through the hill-caves brown, Had lit upon vast chambers, strown With coloured crystals, and had known The silver splendours of the caves That run out underneath the waves, Walled with thick pearl and hung with glaives Of branching coral, and the maze Of all the golden sweet sea-ways, Where, jewel-like, the thin light strays On golden fish and pearléd sand And like a wood, on either hand, The waving banks of seaweed stand. And others of the band could tell Tales of the lands delectable, Upon whose glory, like a spell, The splendour of the unknown lies; Stories of Ind and Orient skies, Of far East isles where never dies The golden noonlight quite away, But night is like a silver day; And of vast cities, which men say Gods built; or that sweet Syrian stead, The city rose-engarlanded, Girdled with many a silver thread Of rivers running sweet and wild Through gardens tamarisk-enisled And orange-groves with blossom piled; Or that clear Paradise that stands, Builded of old by giant hands, Invisible among the sands Of those enchanted plains of Fars, Where from the East narcissus-stars Spread white toward the sunset-bars; And stories of the strange sweet lands Where, like a tower, the tulip stands And jasmines through the wood link hands; Where, curtain-like, the mosses fall, Silver, athwart the banyan-hall And in the night the wild swans call; And of the clear-eyed lakes that shine Bright as the laughing heart of wine, Alive with flower-hued snakes that twine Round mystic flowers therein that are, Blue lotus and gold nenuphar And many a silver lily-star. These all they knew, and many a thing Yet lovelier in remembering: And eke full many an one could sing Such soul-sweet songs, the very deer Came down at eventide to hear: And as they rang out soft and clear, The singing echoes of the wood Woke up out of their silent mood And with full tones the strains pursued Through all the lengthening cells of sound, And all the trees that stood around Waved to the rhythm, music-bound. Some clarion-shrill, some softliest Did sing; and some sighed as the west Sighs to the night; but in my breast A nest of singing birds I had, Whose song was sweet, but very sad; And yet bytimes it made me glad. And these, past all, I loved to hear, What while they fluted, low and clear, Soft songs that did caress mine ear With memories of a Paradise, That ne'er before my weary eyes Had risen nor should ever rise Till Death (mayhap) should set the gate Open for me and I, elate, See all my hopes for me await. And sometimes many a weary day The birds within my bosom lay Voiceless and still. And then full grey And sick my life was even to death; Till, with a swift and sudden breath Of impulse, as of some sweet faith New risen, all the silence fled, The voices rose up from the dead And with one gush of music spread New waves of peace through all my soul; And then my life put off its dole And of my grief I was made whole. So many days this life we led, Curtained with solitudes and fed With drink of dreams; and as the dead Hear afar off, with listless ears, The hurry of the outer years, But sleep, absolved of doubts and fears, So unto us bytimes would come An echo of the worldly hum, Breaking our silence spirit-dumb, And stirred our thought to memories Of earthly passion: but, like sighs Of some vague melody that dies If one give heed unto its strain, The distant hum did faint and wane; And peace encurtained us again. For all our life was filled and sweet With fair glad dreams; and every beat Of the clear-echoing hours did greet Our sense with some new ravishment Of thoughts and fancies: and a scent Of mystic unseen flowers was blent For ever with our daily air, As if some angel, hovering near, Shook odours from his floating hair. And thus our days went by for long, Filled with the glory of a song; And not a touch of care did wrong The eternal Springtide of our dream, And not a ripple broke the gleam That slept along our life's full stream. But, as the years went on and on, All gradually our lives grew wan With some vague yearning and there shone, Day after day, less gloriously The softened splendours in the sky; And one by one, the lights did die Within our spirit. Day by day, Less joy we took in all that lay Of beauty in wood-dell or way; And the heaped jewels in the shade Of our new gloom did change and fade And waste before our eyes dismayed. And no more did we love to go About the woodlands, in the glow Of noonday, or to watch the flow Of rillets through the flower-ringed grass, Or see the dappled shadows pass Across the lake's full-lilied glass. But all our early joys seemed dead And colourless to us: like lead, Upon our lives the stillness weighed. The ringdove's voice and every note The wild lark shook out from his throat And all the linnet's music smote Upon our senses like a knell; And day by day, a sterner spell Of hopeless yearning on us fell. And each fair thing, that we had won In times bygone, did seem fordone Of all its loveliness: and none Of all my days had aught of price Or any delicate device Could cheer them; but the cruel ice Of death seemed on them all to lie, And all their dainty lore laid by; So that they saw with careless eye The secret things they loved so well And wandered on through wood and dell, Careless of aught to them befell. And some, on treasure having lit, Had dug a grave and buried it, So that it gladdened them no whit. And now each sound of toil or sport, That reached our weary ears athwart The wood-screens of our forest-court, Maddened our yearning; and full fain We grew toward the world again; And gladly would we now have ta'en The olden burdens: but the way Was shut with tangled woods that lay And closed each exit to the day. And oftentimes our weary feet Did wander from the wood-deeps sweet, Green-golden in the noontide heat, Into a little path, that led, Through tangling hawthorns blossom-spread, To where sea-cliffs rose white and red Above a many-coloured beach; And through a rugged mountain-breach, We came to where the sea did reach Into the golden-margined sky: And there wide ripples came to die Upon the sands, with one long sigh So sad and so monotonous, In very sooth it seemed to us It was our own grief rendered thus. And there we loved to sit and hear The long waves murmur in our ear And watch the ripples low and clear Lengthen across the swelling tide: And now and then our eyes espied A distant snowy glimmer glide Along the sky-line, as it were Some white-sailed vessel that did fare Toward the shore. But never near The vision drew: and wearily We watched the glimmer fade and flee, Then turned our footsteps from the sea. But yet a spark of old delight Gladdened us sometimes; and the light Slid over all and made life bright Bytimes awhile: for in my breast The songbirds sang out from their nest Sweetlier than ever (though the rest Were silent). And my days and I, We listened, as the hours went by: It seemed all hope should never die, Whilst in my heart the sweet birds sang, That therewithal the whole wood rang And all the thrushes with their clang Of joyful music answered it. Yet often through my heart would flit A stinging fear lest it were writ That some sad day the birds should fly Away and leave me there to die. But, day by day, more lovelily The sweet notes quivered through the air And day by day the singing bare Its wonted solace to my care. So went the days by, one by one, And many a year was past and done, Until one morning, with the sun, A new sweet freshness seemed to rise And all things shone before our eyes, As with the dews of Paradise. And none the less on us took hold An unformed hope, a joy untold: And in our hearts, all blank and cold, There sprang a new sweet prescience, That was like wine of life, a sense Of some expectant glad suspense, A waiting, sure of its desire, For some new gladness to transpire And touch our pallid lips with fire. Nor was our yearning hope belied; For, as the clear fresh morning died Into the golden summer-tide That fills the noonday, there came one That brought into the woodlands dun The fulfilled splendour of the sun. Along a slope of grass she came: And as she walked, a virgin shame Lit up her face's snow with flame. Full slight and small she was and bent Her lithe neck shyly, as she went, In some childlike bewilderment. Gold was the colour of her hair; The colour of her eyes was vair; The sun shone on her everywhere. O fair she was as hawthorn-flowers! It seemed the flush of the Spring-hours Lay on her cheeks and Summer-showers Had bathed her in a calm content, A virginal faint ravishment Of peace; for with her came a scent Of flowers plucked with a childish hand In some forgotten Fairyland, Where all arow the sweet years stand. And all the creatures of the wood Crept from their leafy solitude And wondering around her stood. The fawns came to her, unafraid, And on her hand their muzzles laid: And fluttering birds flew down and stayed, Singing, upon her breast and hair, Most fearlessly, and nestled there, Such charms of peace about her were. Then all my weary days arose, As doves rise from the olive-close, When the dawn opens like a rose, And said, “We have been sad too long: From morning-gold to even-song, We have bemoaned ourselves for wrong; “And now the pleasant years are fled, (Say, is our mouth the early red?) And our life hastens to the dead; “And yet our yearning is unstayed. But now the hope for which we prayed Is found; the comfort long-delayed “Shines in our sight. We will arise And go to her; for in her eyes The promise of the new Spring lies. “Lo! this is the Deliverer, Awearied for from year to year; See, the sun's sign is gold on her.” Then with a strange and sudden thrill, A new life seemed to rise and fill The channels of my brain, until The old sad solitary peace Fell off from me; and there did cease From round me, with a swift decrease, The ancient agony of doubt And yearning for the things without: And therewithal my soul flowered out Into a rapture of desire Celestial; and some new sweet fire Of hope rose in me high and higher. For in her kind child-eyes there shone A radiance tender as the dawn And by their light my heart was drawn To auguries of life fulfilled; And hope o'erleapt the line grey-hilled, That shut my days in, sad and stilled, Into some fresh clear world beyond, Where thought is with fulfilment crowned And Life to Love alone is bond. To me she came and laid to mine The velvet of her lips divine And looked into my faded eyne With eyes that seemed to swim in gold Of perfect passion and to hold The Love that never shall grow cold. And there with hers my life was made One, as it seemed. From dell to glade, The wild wood lifted off its shade; And through the aisles the frank sun leapt And startled out the dreams that slept And filled with smiles the eyes that wept. And all my tearful days and sad Put off their gloom and were made glad; For there was that in her forbad The sourest sorrow to abide, Where once its place was glorified By that clear presence sunny-eyed: And like the wild rose after rain, They lifted up their eyes again, The clearer for the bygone pain, Love-led by hers: and all their store They gave and taught her o'er and o'er The secrets of their dainty lore. So Hope and I made friends anew, Whilst over all the morning dew Fell down; the clouded sky broke blue Through tears of joy and ravishment; And all my lifeless life was blent With faith and peace, what time we went, I and my lady, hand in hand, Where all the hours run golden sand, In Love's enchanted Fairyland. Ah love, how sad remembrance is Of lips joined in the first love-kiss And all the wasted early bliss! Ah, bitter sad it is to stand And look back to the ghostly strand, Where our lost dreams lie hand in hand And slumber in the grey of years! Ah, weary sad to rain down tears Upon their graves, until the biers Give up to earth the much-loved dead And one by one, with drooping head, Our dead hopes pass by us adread, Each with its beauty of the Past, Pale with long prison and aghast, Whilst on the wind there shrills a blast Of moaning dirges that for us Of old were songs melodious, Our sweet days rendered to us thus! Ah, sadder still to live and live, Till Death itself it seems can give Hardly the rest for which we strive! How long the new life lasted me, I cannot tell: the hours did flee Like summer winds across the sea, Unseen, unheard; for day was knit To golden day and night was lit With such delight, I had no wit Of Time. The shadow of his flight Scarce showed against the blaze of light Wherewith love flooded day and night. And in that new illumining Of Hope and Faith, each precious thing, From which the light had taken wing In our old night of dreariment, Put off its sadness and was blent With our new life in ravishment. Ah, how we loved, my days and I, To lead her where old dreams did lie, Buried of yore with many a sigh, To clear the rank grass from the tomb And watch the dead delight out-bloom, Lovelier than ever, from the gloom, At one glance of her radiant eyne, And all those desert wastes of mine, Conscious of her, arise and shine! So went I with her, hand in hand, Through dell and glade of all the land; And everywhere, at her command, Sprang into life forgotten flowers, Long laid asleep beneath the hours; And from entangling weeds, waste bowers Of rose and woodbind blossomed out Into new beauty, hymned about With bird-song; and a joyous rout Of echoes ran from dell to dell, Praising her presence and the spell That like a perfume from her fell. Nay, at her voice the monsters fled, That had so long, in doubt and dread, Held my life level with the dead; And through the tangled forest shade, There was, meseemed, a new way made, In which my hope trod, unafraid, Toward the gracious world of men And drank, beneath the free sun's ken, The breath of daily life again. And then my song-birds, if before Their song was sweet, ah! how much more It rang out lovely than of yore! For from my bosom where they lay And measured all the weary day With madrigal and roundelay, I took them singing in their nest And laid them in my lady's breast, To sing to her their loveliest. Thence, as we went about the ways Of that strange wonderland, my days And I had given our lives to raise, Their voices filled the sun-shot air With music such as spirits hear Ring down the golden city's stair, When to the new-fledged soul arise, Bathed in the light that never dies, The citadels of Paradise. Ah! dreary labour of despair, To tell again the joys that were, The dead delights that have been fair! When hardly can dull thought retrace, Even in dreams, the lost love's face, The sweetness of the vanished grace. For lost it is to me for aye, My dream of love born but to die, My glimpse of Heaven so soon past by. It seemed my bliss had worn away Hardly a summer's space of day And hardly yet the full light lay Upon my winter-wasted years, When round my joy a mist of fears Began to gather: in mine ears A sound of sobbing winds did sigh And in full sunshine clouds swept by, Darkening the visage of the sky. And but too surely did my soul, Though Summer in the land was whole, Forethink me of the coming dole: For on my short-lived sunny tide The shadow of old griefs would glide, With wings of memories grey and wide, Breaking the promise of the sun: And wraiths of ancient hopes fordone Rose in my pathway, one by one, Each with some mocking prophecy Of happiness condemned to die, As ever in the days gone by. And voices of forgotten pain Sang round me, with a weird refrain, Of short-lived Summers that did wane To dreary Autumns of despair And winters fiercer for the fair Lost memories of Junes that were. And all in vain the coming fate, That in my pathway stood await, I strove to conjure from Love's gate; Its omen lay upon my bliss And stole the sweetness from Love's kiss: I stood and looked on an abyss, That gaped to end that life of ours, And strove in vain with lavish flowers To stay the progress of the hours. Even in my lady's eyes of light I saw the presage of the night; And in the middle love-delight, Bytimes across her face would flit A shadowy sadness, past Love's wit To slay the hidden snake in it. At last (so prescient was my grief Its grim fulfilment seemed relief) The storm, that o'er my flower-time brief So long had brooded, broke the spell Of imminent thunder, —and I fell Straight from Love's Heaven down to Hell. For, one sad morn, awakening, An added sadness seemed to cling And hover over everything; The sun gave but a ghost of light And for the funeral of the night, The flowers seemed shrouded all in white: And listening, full of some vague fear, For those sweet songs that used to cheer My saddest hours, there smote mine ear No note of birds from east to west; The wood was dumb: but in my breast The ancient dirges of unrest Began with doubled stress to tear My heartstrings, burdened as it were With some renewal of despair. Then gradually into my thought The full sad sense of all was wrought And starting up, alarmed, I sought My love's hands and her lips' delight, Ay, and her bosom's silver-white, To heal me of my soul's affright. Alas! mine eyes could find no trace Of her late presence: and her place Was empty of my lady's grace. How many a day my sad steps wore The wild wood pathways and the shore, I cannot tell: the brown sand bore No traces of her flying feet: But now and then the tiny beat Of wild deer's hoofs or the retreat Of forest creatures through the trees, That rustled in the passing breeze, Mimicked the sound of one that flees: And in my heart hope sprang again, (Ah, cruel hope!) only to wane And leave new sharpness to my pain. And so the weary days crept by, Whilst in the greyness of the sky The morning lights did rise and die And evening sunsets came and went As tenderly as though they meant To mock at my bewilderment. But nevermore my lady's sight Gladdened mine eyes: the day and night Went empty by of all delight And dumb the wild wood was and still; For all my birds, that wont to fill The aisles with many a dainty trill And gush of silver song, had fled, Following where'er my lady led, And left me lonely as the dead. The colours faded from the flowers: And in the hollow midwood bowers, The falling footsteps of the hours Smote on the silence like a knell, And on my soul the shadow fell And lay there, irrevocable. For Love, the sun of life, had set And nevermore should morning let The sunshine for me through the net That coming death had drawn about My weary head. Despair and doubt Reigned in me, since Love's light was out. Will she return, my lady? Nay: Love's feet, that once have learned to stray, Turn never to the olden way. Ah heart of mine, where lingers she? By what live stream or saddened sea? What wild-flowered swath of sungilt lea Do her feet press and are her days Sweet with new stress of love and praise Or sad with echoes of old lays? Meknoweth not: but this I know, My wan face haunts her in the glow Of sunset, and my sad eyes grow Athwart the darkness on her sight, When in the middle hush of night She sees the shadow grow moon-white. And in the pauses of a kiss, There smite her, like a serpent's hiss From out piled flowers, the memories Of all our passion of the past: And then her face grows white and ghast And all her summer is o'ercast With shadows of the dead delight: A little while, in her despite, The old love claims again its right; Her soul is one again with mine: And gladly would she then resign Her heedless life of summer-shine, To seek once more the silent nest, Wherein my life is laid, and rest Her weary head upon my breast. But ah! the way is all o'ergrown With underwoods and many a stone Blocks up the pathway, shadow-strown; And never may she win to me, Nor I to her: Eternity Is spread betwixt us like a sea. For Love, that pardoneth not, hath ta'en Back to himself the golden chain That bound our lives; and ne'er again, Nor in this life of hours and days, Nor in that hidden world that stays For us beyond the grave-grown ways, Our hands shall join, our lips shall meet; Never again with aught of sweet Shall our twinned hearts together beat. But through the mists of life and death, The sorrow that remembereth Shall haunt her and the very breath Of heaven be bitter to her spright, (Grown sadder for its clearer sight) For memories laden with despite Of that lost love so lightly seen, So lightly left, that might have been The fairest flower of heaven's sheen. FLOWERS FROM SYRIAN GARDENS. Flowers from Syrian Gardens. These eight poems are founded upon stories from the Thousand and One Nights. I.The Apples of Paradise. To Him who cleaves the darkness with the light, Who veils and covers with the thick black night The dim cold cheek of faint and fading day, The glory and the worship be alway! I, Aboubekr, hight El Anberi, (For that 'twas Anber town gave birth to me,) God's servant and His Law's expositor, For my occasions journeying heretofore Unto Amorium in the land of Roum, For visitation of a hermit's tomb, At Enwar village lighted down midway. Hard by there stood (and standeth yet to day Belike,) whereas upon the hilltop leans The heaven, a monastery of Nazarenes, With battlements and turrets builded high And spires that held the cross up to the sky. The prior of the monks, Abdulmesíh By name, (the which, interpreted, is he Who serves the Christ,) from those who dwelt about Learning my coming, unto me came out And brought me in unto the monastery. There forty monks I found, who harboured me With passing hospitality that night; And never, since I looked upon the light, (Albeit far and wide I've fared and much And marvellous have seen,) beheld I such Abounding piety and diligence Devout in prayer and praise and penitence As in these Nazaritish monks I saw. Then, on the morrow, ere the day did daw, I took my leave of them and faring on Unto Amorium, thence, my business done, Returned to Anber by another road Nor at the monastery again abode. Now it befell next year, with Allah's aid, The pilgrimage to Mecca that I made And there, in honour of the Omnipotent As compassing the Holy House I went, Abdulmesíh the prior I espied And five of his companions him beside, All on the circuit of the Kaabeh bent. Which when I saw, on me astoniment There fell; then after him in haste I hied And overtaking him, was certified That he himself it was in life and limb, And not his wraith; wherefore, accosting him, “Sir,” said I, “art thou not (God's name on it!) “Abdulmesíh er Ráhib (monk, to wit,)?” And he, “Not so: Abdallah is my name, Er Rághib hight.” (Which, being on the same Fashion interpreted, God's servant means, Desireful dubbed, a name to Nazarenes Assigned, who turn to Islam of God's grace.) This when I heard, the tears o'erran my face And for sheer joy and bliss unspeakable, Awhile a word I could not speak, but fell His hoary locks to kissing, all unmanned For very ravishment. Then, by the hand Taking, I carried him apart with me Into a corner of the Sanctuary And in His name who sunders night from day, Conjured him of the reason and the way Of his and his companions' having been Turned from the error of the Nazarene To Islam and the road of righteousness Our ignorance and yearning to possess. Whereunto he, in answer, “Sir, the cause Of our conversion,” said, “a wonder was, Forsooth, of wonders inenarrable; And on this wise it was that it befell. No great while after you our humble cell Did with your too brief presence, of your grace, Honour and ornament, unto the place, Whereas our monastery is situate, It chanced there came, by the decree of Fate And Fortune foreordained, a company Of Muslim devotees, unknowing we Whence did they come and whither they were boun, Who entered not therein, but, lighting down Without the walls, a youth, of those that went Wandering with them, into the village sent, To buy them victual. Faring, with that aim, About the place, it chanced that, as he came Into the market, lifting up his head, He spied a damsel sitting selling bread, A Nazarene who was and passing fair, With sea-blue eyes and gracious golden hair. No sooner did his gaze upon her light Than stricken dumb he was with her sweet sight And of her lovesome looks, as by some spell O'erta'en, incontinent so sore he fell Enamoured that, his patience and his sense Forsaking him, aswoon, at unprepense, He fell upon his face and so he lay. Then, coming to himself, he took his way Back to his comrades with the provender And bade them “Fare you well! I tarry here. Go ye about your business; weal or woe, Betide what will, I may not with you go.” Thereat amazement took them and they chid And questioned him. But still the cause he hid Of his resolve; so they, to them no heed Finding he gave and having done their need, Left him to his devices and fared on: Whilst he, poor star-struck fool, returned anon Into the town and at the damsel's door Sat down. She, seeing him a-sit before Her place and knowing him no villager, Came forth and asked him what he would with her. He, having nothing but her in his thought, Full simply answered her that all distraught For love of her he was and like to die; Whereat she turned from him without reply, As haply angered at his simpleness. But he, nowhit rebuffed, nor more nor less Abiding, like a statue, three days' space, With his eyes fixed upon the damsel's face, There in the open door, before her shop, Sat on, without food tasted, bit or drop. Then, when she saw that, 'spite of everywhat She did, the youth from her departed not, She sought her kinsfolk dwelling in the place And taking counsel with them of the case, They loose on him the village urchins let, Who straight with sticks and stones did him beset And stoned him from afar and broke his head And bruised his ribs; but still, as he were dead, He sat nor budged for aught that they might do. Wherefore the people of the place anew Counsel together took to kill the wight: But one of them there came to me by night And advertised me of the thing in thought Which was to do and how to slay they sought The stranger youth. So I went forth and found The hapless Muslim prostrate on the ground, Bescored with bleeding wounds and stiff with mud And gore. Then from his face I wiped the blood And carried him into the monastery, Whereas I dressed his wounds, and he with me Some fourteen days abode. But hardly had He gotten strength to walk, poor silly lad, Than he the convent left and to her door Returning, on the damsel as before Sat gazing, unadread. Which when she saw, Forth unto him she came and “By God's Law, Thou movest me to pity!” said. “If thou My faith wilt enter, by the Cross I vow, I will e'en marry thee.” “If this I did, 'Twere ill with me,” he answered. “Heaven forbid That I should leave the faith of Unity Of God and enter that whose Gods are three!” “Then come with me into my house,” she said, “And take thy will of me, that am a maid, And go thy ways in peace.” But he, “Not so. How shall I for a moment's lust forego And barter for a fleeting bliss the tears, The prayers, the pious service of twelve years?” “Then,” answered she, “forthright from me depart.” But he, “Ah wellaway! fair maid, my heart Will nowise suffer me do that,” did say. Wherefore she turned her face from him away; And presently the boys of the young man Became aware and gathering, began A-pelting him with stones again, till he Upon his face fell, saying, “Verily, God is my keeper, He who down the Book Sent and the righteous never yet forsook!” Things being at this pass, I sallied forth And driving off the rabble, from the earth Lifted the Muslim's head and heard him say, “O God, unite Thou me with her, I pray, In Paradise!” Then in my arms, to bear Unto the convent, him I took: but, ere The shelter I might reach, he died; and I, Without the village boundaries, hard by, Digging a grave, before the day grew dim, There with my own hands sadly buried him. That night, when all else in the village slept, Those on the walls and in the ways that kept The accustomed watch and ward, the damsel heard Give a great cry (and she abed) that stirred The sleeping folk and roused them from their rest. So they rose up, with slumber yet opprest, And flocking all together to the maid, Questioned her of her case; whereto she said, “But now, what while I slept without affray, The Muslim came to me, who died to-day, And took me by the hand and carried me Unto the gates of Paradise. But he, Who kept the ward thereof, me withinside Would nowise suffer, saying, “Tis denied To unbelievers in God's promised land To enter.” Wherefore, at the young man's hand, Islam I straight embraced and entering Therein with him, saw gardens blossoming, With rivers under them, and flowering trees, Yea, and pavilions eke and palaces Such that description faileth me withal To image one least jot to you of all That therewithin I looked upon. Anon He brought me unto a pavilion With pearls and gems high-builded, saying, “Mine Foreordered this pavilion is and thine; Nor will I enter it except with thee. But, after five days' space, thou shalt with me Together of a surety be in it, So God most High do of His will deem fit.” Then to an apple-tree,—that at the door Of that pavilion, with its golden store Of fruit the air enbalsaming, did stand, High-laden, glorious,—putting forth his hand, He plucked two apples, shining as the sun, And to me gave them, bidding me eat one And keep the other, that the monks might view The thing with their own eyes and know it true. So one of the two apples did I eat And never than its savour aught more sweet I tasted. By the hand, then, taking me Yet once again, he brought me presently Back to my house, whereas on sleep again I fell; and when awhile therein I'd lain, Awakening, I started up in haste And in my mouth the eaten apple's taste And in my hand the other holden found.” So saying, she her girdle-cloth unwound And brought the apple forth unto their sight, Which in the mirk and dead of middle night, When all things else to vision hidden are, Shone in the darkness like a sparkling star. Therewith they brought her to the monastery, Whereas her vision unto us did she Anew recount and did the apple show; Nor, of all fruits that in the world do grow, E'er on the like and fellow did we look Of that same apple. Then a knife I took And in as many pieces even as we The apple cut were folk in company; And never more delicious knew we aught Nor sweeter than its taste. But in our thought We said, “This sure some demon was, some wraith Of hell, that, to seduce her from her faith, Appeared to her, when, in the dead of night, Men's wit is weak for lack of wholesome light.” Then her folk took her and with her away Departed; but the damsel from that day From meat and drink abstained, till the fifth night, When from her bed she rose by the moon's light And going forth the village to the place Where the young Muslim buried was, her face She pillowed on the grave and by his side, Who died for love of her, lay down and died. Her people knew not what was come of her; But, on the morrow, with the day's first stir, Two Muslim elders to the place there came, In haircloth garbed, and with them, on the same Stern fashion clad, two women; and they said, “O people of the village, with you dead A woman of God's friends there lieth, who A Muslim died, and we, instead of you, To take the charge of her are hither sent.” Wherefore her people seeking for her went, Till on the Muslim's grave they found her laid, And “This our sister of our faith,” they said, “Was and assuredly therein she died, And we will bury her.” “Not so,” replied The two old men; “in that of unity Of God she died; and so we claim her, we.” And the dispute betwixt the parties twain Waxed hot till “Idle is the talk and vain,” Quoth one of the old Muslims. “This the test Be of her faith. If she the Cross confessed, As ye do fable of her, let there be The monks, all forty, from the monastery Fetched hither and to lift her up essay From this our sad dead brother's grave. If they Avail for doing this, a Nazarene It that she died shall by approof be seen. If not, then one of us unto the field Shall come and lift her up; and if she yield To him, it shall appear that in good deed She died a Muslim.” So the folk agreed To this and thither fetched the monks twoscore, Who, heartening each other, laboured sore To lift her up, but might not make her stir. Then a great rope about the midst of her We bound and haled upon it with our might. But the stout rope in sunder broke outright, So that we fell; and stirless still she lay Nor would she budge, for aught we might essay. Nay, of the villagers came all who would And their endeavours joined to ours, but could Not any fashion move her from her place. Then, when we thus had striven for a space And every our device had proved in vain, To one of those old Muslim pilgrims twain, “Come thou and raise her, if thou canst,” we said. So to the grave he came and o'er the maid His mantle spreading for a covering, Said, “In the name of the Compassionate King, Of God the Merciful, the only One, Maker of earth and sea and sky and sun, And of His Prophet's faith, the Best of Men, On whom be blessing and salvation!” Then He lightly lifted her without demur And in his bosom taking, so with her Betook himself unto a cave hard by, Wherein full tenderly he let her lie. Thither anon the Muslim women came And laid her out and washed her in God's name And shrouded her in webs of woollen blue. Then the two elders took her up anew And bearing her to the young Muslim's tomb, Prayed over her and delving her a room, Hard by his side, till night and day should cease, Laid her to rest and went their ways in peace. Now we were witness to all this; and when Alone again, apart from other men, Within the quiet monastery's shade, We were and private each with each, we said One to another, “Of a verity, The truth most worthy is to followed be; And publicly indeed made manifest It hath been unto us; nor any test More clear nor plainer proof of Islam's truth, Than in this matter of the Muslim youth And of the Christian damsel hath this day, Passing the power of any to gainsay, Unto our eyes been rendered visible And we have witnessed, were it possible To have.” So I and all the monks did recognize The Faith of Righteousness, and on like wise Did all the townsfolk; and incontinent To those of Irak Arabi we sent, Seeking a doctor of the law, that us Should in the ordinances glorious Of Islam and the canon and the rite Of prayer endoctrine. Whereupon forthright A pious man they sent us and a fair, Who taught us all the ritual of prayer And all devotion's forms and usances, With allwhat else that appertaining is Unto the service of the Heavenly King. And now in great good case in everything We are and blesséd are our nights and days, To Allah be the glory and the praise, To Him who orders all the worldly ways, Whose hand doth this exalt and that abase, Turner of Hearts and Changer of the Case, Who still accomplisheth, in all men's sight, The common miracle of Day and Night!” II.The Scavenger of Baghdad. One day, at Mecca, in the Sanctuary, When all the folk were busied silently In compassing the Holy House about, A man unto the Kaabeh-cloth put out His hand and seizing by the corner-ring Upon the border of the covering, Cried, “O my God, I do entreat of Thee, Of Thy great grace and magnanimity, My lady's husband to the serving wench Cause Thou return, so I once more may quench My love and longing on her body fair!” All, hearing this, awhile astonied were; But, presently, recovering their sense, They loaded him with blows and bore him thence In bonds unto the Amir of the Hajj, (To wit, the Prefect of the Pilgrimage,) And “O my lord,” to him said they, “this man Hath such and such things done, as all we can Attest, and in the Holy House this wise Hath open scandal wrought in all men's eyes.” The Prefect, hearing that which he had said, Was angered passing sore with him and bade Bear him forthright without the Temple-close And hang him up for warning unto those Who should in time to come affected be, Like him, to violate the Sanctuary. But he, demanding speech before he died, For his excusement, thus to him replied; “O Prefect, by the Prophet, whom God bless And save! I do conjure thee, in my stress, That thou wilt first my story hearken to And after what thou willest with me do.” “Say on,” rejoined the Prefect; and the man, “Know then, o Amir of the Hajj,” began, “That I a scavenger in old Baghdad Was late and for my occupation had The offal from the slaughterhouses there Unto the heaps without the walls to bear. One day, as with my laden ass I went, I saw the people in bewilderment Hither and thither running, as it were To shun some danger, though I saw none there; And unto me, unknowing what this meant, “Enter this alley here in haste,” quoth one, “Thee lest they kill.” “What ails the folk to run?” Quoth I; and he, “It is the eunuchs, trow, Attendant on the wife of so-and-so, One of the notables, who from her road The people thrust and drive away and load Their shoulders and their backs with cuffs and blows, Without distinction made of these and those.” Withal aside I turned me with the ass And stood expecting till the crowd should pass Me by. Then presently up came a band Of half a score of eunuchs, staff in hand, With well nigh thirty women after them; And in their midst a lady like a gem, Clad all in gold-wrought silk from feet to face, Perfect in elegance and amorous grace, Beyond all telling excellently fair, As she a willow wand for slimness were, Ay, or a thirsting, languorous gazelle. Her glance upon me in the passage fell And she, an eunuch calling, in his ear Some order whispered that I could not hear; Wherewith to me, as it would seem she bade, He came and seizing me without word said, He bound me with a rope and haled me on After himself; whilst yet another one, Taking my ass, made off with it, I knew Not whither, neither that which was to do; And all the people followed after us, Calling for help on God the Glorious And saying, “`Tis unlawful in God's sight! What hath this fellow done that he, poor wight, Should bounden be with cords? For heaven's sake,” Quoth they unto the eunuchs, “pity take On him and let him go, so God with you As you with him shall of His mercy do!” And “Doubtless,” said I in myself the while, “The eunuch seized on me, for that the vile Stench of the offal, as she passed by here, His mistress scented and it sickened her; And she belike with child or ailing is. But neither virtue neither power, ywis, Is, save in God, exalted be His name!” So I fared on behind them till they came Unto a great house-door and entering there, Into a high hall carried me, with fair And goodly furniture beset, God wot, How I shall tell its fairness I know not. The women, to the harem faring all, Bound left me with the eunuch in the hall; And in myself, “Assuredly,” quoth I, “Here will they torture me until I die And no one of my death aware shall be.” However, by and by, they carried me Into a bath-room that adjoined thereto; And as I sat and wondered what to do Might be, in came three damsels fair and feat, Who round me in a ring themselves did seat And said, “Put off thy rags from thee.” So I My threadbare clothes at their behest laid by And one to rub my feet herself bestirred And one to wash my head, whilst yet a third With soap to scrubbing all my body fell. Then, when they throughly washed me had and well, A parcel of rich clothes they brought and bade Me don them: but, “By Allah, nay!” I said; “I know not how to do it.” So the three Invested me withal and laughed at me The while; and after casting-bottles brought, With rose- and willow-blossom-water fraught, And sprinkled me therewith. Then must I go With them into a great saloon, I know Indeed not how to tell its graciousness, For all the goodly paintings and the press Of fair-wrought furniture that all around Therein I saw. Here I the lady found, Upon a couch of Indian cane a-seat With legs of ivory, and at her feet A score of damsels. She, on me her eye Casting, arose and called to me; so I Went up to her and she beside her made Me sit and presently her servants bade Bring food; and they all manner brought rich meats, Lambs, fowls, kebábs and curries, pasties, sweets, Such as I never in my life had seen, Nor half the different dishes knew I e'en By name. I ate my fill and presently, The dishes being cleared away, when we Had washed our hands, she called for fruits and bade Me eat thereof; then one her waiting-maid Commanded bring the wine-service. So they A table full of flagons did array With divers kinds of wines and burned in all The censers perfumes. Then, upon her call, A damsel like the moon at full rose up And with the wineflask waited on our cup, Whilst others came with chants and carollings And dances, measured by the smitten strings: And I with her did sit the while and drink, Till we were warm with wine, and could not think That this than a delusion of the mind In dreams was otherwhat. Anon she signed To one of those her serving-maids a bed For us in such and such a place to spread, Which being presently, with her command Accordant, done, she took me by the hand And led me thither. So with her I lay In all delight until the risen day; And still, as in my arms I did her press, Caress fore'er ensuing on caress And clips and kisses still on clip and kiss, The fragrances of musk and ambergris, That from her body sweet exhaled, I smelt, Nor ever otherwhat I thought nor felt But that in Paradise I was and through The mazes of a dream did still pursue The shapes of slumber. Then, when night was gone And day drew back the curtains of the dawn, She asked me where I lodged and her I told, “In such a place.” Wherewith a kerchief, gold And silver wrought, she gave me, where somewhat Was in the corner knotted with a knot, And “To the bath with this go,” saying, bad Me get me gone. And I withal was glad And in myself, “If here there be,” quoth I, “But farthings five, the morning-meal 'twill buy.” Then forth from her, as if from Paradise, Homeward I fared and opening in a trice The kerchief, fifty golden dinars found Therein and straightway buried underground; Then bought two farthings' worth of meat and bread And at the door sat down and breakfasted; And after, pondering my case, sat there Until the hour of afternoontide prayer, Whenas there came a slave-girl in to me And greeting, said, “My mistress calls for thee.” So I unto the mansion aforesaid, Without word spoken, followed, as she bade, Till me unto the lady in she brought, With whom I ate and drank and lay and wrought In all things as I did the day before, In joy and wonder waxing evermore. And when with morning-light I must bestir And get me gone again, I had of her Another handkerchief and therein tied Yet fifty dinars, wherewithal I hied Me home in haste and buried these as those. Thus did I eight days running, at the close Of light her visiting and with new day Departing still from her. But, as we lay On the eighth night together, one her maid Came running in to us in haste and bade Me “Rise and into yonder closet go;” And I betook me thither evenso. There was a window giving on the street; And presently the tramp of horses' feet I heard and forth, to see what should betide, Looking, amiddleward the way espied A young man, fair of countenance and bright As is the full moon of the fourteenth night, Come riding up, attended by a score Of slaves and soldiers. Halting at the door, He lighted down and entering thereby, In the saloon the lady seated high In sullen state upon the dais found. So, going up to her, he kissed the ground Before her, then her hands upon like wise; But she to him uplifted not her eyes Nor answered him. Withal he did not spare To soothe her with soft words and speak her fair Until he made his peace with her and they That night till break of dawn together lay, When those same soldiers came for him and he Mounted and rode with them away. Then she Came in to me and “Sawst thou yonder man?” Quoth she. “Yes,” answered I; and she began, “He is my husband and I will thee tell That which betwixt myself and him befell. It chanced one day that in the garden we Within the courtyard sitting were, when he, Arising thence, into the house withdrew And absent was so long that tired I grew Of waiting him and sought him everywhere About the house; but, finding him not there, Unto the kitchen, seeking him, I went And saw a slave-girl, who incontinent To me, in quest of him, at my demand, Discovery made of him, where nigh at hand He with a slave-wench of the cookmaids lay. This when I saw, an oath I swore straightway That with the foulest and the filthiest wight, On whom in all the city I could light, Adultery I'd do; and when on thee The eunuch seized and brought thee in to me, I had four days gone all Baghdad about In quest of one among the rabble-rout Apt to my oath; nor in the city's round A fouler nor a filthier I found Than thee. So thee I took and there befell Between us that whereof thou wottest well, Even as to us had God foreordered it. And presently of that mine oath I'm quit; But, should my husband evermore be fain Unto the cookmaid to return again And lie with her anew, I will once more Thee to my favours,” added she, “restore.” When from her lovesome lips this cruel word (The scavenger went on to say) I heard And with the arrows of her looks the while My heart and soul at once she did beguile And pierce, my tears ran down upon my cheek Till red mine eyes with weeping were and weak, And sore I did bewail me of her scorn And cursed the sorry day when I was born. Then other fifty dinars gave she me, (Making in all four hundred which had she On me bestowed), and bade me go my ways. So I went forth and after sundry days, Took up my pilgrimage and hither came, That I might pray God (Blesséd be His name!) Her husband cause return unto the maid, So haply I might yet, as she had said, Once more admitted be unto her grace.” The Prefect of the Pilgrims on his case Compassion took and unto that which he To tell had having hearkened, set him free And in the name of God the Lord Most High, Omnipotent, conjured the standers-by, Bidding them “Pray for him; for, wot ye well, In this he did he was excusable.” III.The Blacksmith who could handle fire without hurt. A certain pious man whilom heard tell That there in such and such a town did dwell A smith who in the middle furnace-flare Could to the elbow thrust his forearm bare And forth thereof the redhot iron bring And handle without hurt. So, journeying, Unto the place he came and found the man; And watching him, as he to work began, He saw him do as it of him was said; For that, unburned, the iron, being red, He gripped and handled very coals of fire. Whereat there overcame him great desire To know the reason of the wondrous thing; So, waiting till the smith left hammering And stood, his day's work done, at easance, he Accosted him and gave him courteously To understand that he his guest that night Would be: whereto, “With all my heart,” the wight Said and it being now the even-gloam, The stranger took and carried with him home, Whereas they supped together and to sleep Lay down. And all night long the guest did keep Strait watch upon his host, but saw no sign, Passing the common, of devout design Or piety especial; and quoth he Unto himself, “Belike he doth from me Of his humility himself conceal, Unto a stranger shame his pious zeal Thinking to show and fain himself to hide From all save God.” Wherefore he did abide A second night with him and eke a third, But nothing more than common saw or heard; Nay, that he did no more than keep, he saw, The ordinary letter of the Law And rose but little in the night to pray, As of their wont who follow in God's way, Seeking to gain some special grace Divine. Then, at the last, to him, “O brother mine, Of the rare gift and great which hath conferred Of God upon thee been,” quoth he, “I've heard And with mine eyes the truth thereof have seen, How thou of the Most High hast favoured been, In that He fire to handle without hurt Hath granted thee, and yet of such desert, As in His sight such singular great grace Hath gotten thee, can find in thee no trace. Moreover, I have noted thee with care And marked thine assiduity in prayer And exercise devout, but find in thee No fervour of especial piety, Such as distinguisheth, among the rest Of mortals, those in whom made manifest Are such miraculous gifts as this of thine. Whence, then, I prithee, cometh this, in fine, To thee?” And “O my guest,” he made reply, “Hearken and I will tell thee. Know that I Enamoured of a damsel passing fair Was aforetime and her with many a prayer And amorous solicitation wooed. But, howsoever sore to her I sued, Requiring her of love, no whit prevail Could I with her; for she withouten fail Clave to her chastity and gave no ear To my solicitance. Then came a year Of drought and dearth; and hardship terrible There was. Food failed the folk and there befell In all the land a famine passing sore. One day at home I sat, when at the door One knocked and going out, the cruel fair I found, of whom I told thee, standing there; And unto me, “O brother mine,” she said, “Behold, I am for hunger well nigh dead And with reared hands myself to thee betake, Beseeching thee to feed me for God's sake.” And “Know'st not how I love thee,” I replied, “And how I for thy sake have pined and sighed And suffered for thy love? Forsooth, no whit Of food, except thou, in return for it, Do amorously yield thyself to me, Thee will I give.” But, “Better death,” quoth she, “Than disobedience;” and turned away From me and went; but, on the second day Thereafter, with the like petition came And I for answer rendered her the same. Whereon she entered, faint and scant of breath, And sat her down, nigh being unto death. Then I before her set a mess of meat; Whereat her eyes ran over and “To eat Give me for God in heaven's sake,” quoth she, “To whom pertaineth might and majesty!” But “Nay, by Allah!” answered I. “Not so, Except thyself to me, before thou go, Thou yield;” and “Better death,” was her reply, “Is than the wrath to me of God Most High.” Withal untouched the food she left and went, This verse repeating for her heartenment: O Thou the Only God, Whose grace embraceth all that be, Thine ears have heard my moan, Thine eyes have seen my misery. Indeed, privation and distress are heavy on my head: I cannot tell of all the woes which do beleaguer me. I am as one athirst, that looks upon a running stream, Yet may not drink a single draught of all that he doth see. My flesh will have me buy its will: alack! its pleasures flee: The sin that pays their price abides to all eternity. For two days' space I saw of her no more; Then she, a third time coming to my door, Knocked and I sallied out to her. And lo! Hunger away her voice had taken, so That first she might not speak; but, presently, Somedele herself recovering, quoth she, (And haggard she with hunger was and gaunt,) “See, o my brother, I am worn with want And what to do, indeed, I do not know; For I to none but thee my face can show. Wilt thou not, then, for love of God Most High, Feed me?” But still, “Not so,” did I reply, “Excepting ruth thou have on my chagrin And yield to me.” Wherewith she entered in And there sat down. Now for the nonce no meat Ready I had and cooked for her to eat; So I went forth, thereof for her desire To dress, and in the brazier kindled fire. But, when the meat was cooked and in its place Upon the platter laid, behold, the grace Of God Most High there entered into me And to myself I said, “Now out on thee! This woman, weak and frail as women are Of wit and faith, hath food forborne thus far, Rather than do a thing of Holy Writ Forbidden unto her, till she from it, For stress of hunger, can endure no more: Nay, time on time she doth and o'er and o'er Refuse and thou persistest yet, forby, In disobedience to God Most High!” And “O my God, I do repent to thee Of that which had been purposéd of me,” I said; then took the food and to the maid Bringing it in, the dish before her laid And “Eat and be” I bade her “of good cheer: There shall no harm betide thee. Have no fear; For this is for the sake of God Supreme, Whom only might and majesty beseem.” This when she hearkened, lifting up her head And hands to heaven, “O Thou my God,” she said, “If this man be sincere in this he saith, I pray Thee, of my service and my faith, Be fire to do him hurt forbid of Thee, Both in this world and in the world to be! For Thou indeed art He that answereth prayer And able art for doing whatsoe'er Thou wilt.” Withal I left her and anew The fire out in the brazier went to do. Now 'twas the season of the winter cold And from the brazier, as it chanced, there rolled A burning coal and on my body fell: But, by the ordinance of God, in Hell And Heaven, as on earth, Omnipotent, In whom all might and majesty consent, Nor pain nor incommodity in aught I felt and it was borne upon my thought That God her prayer had answered. So I took The hot coal in my hand (which else to brook Had been uneath, but now it irked me not) And going in to her, with it red-hot, On my palm flaming, said to her, “Rejoice! For God, behold, hath hearkened to the voice Of that thy prayer and granted thy desire To thee of me, forbidding thus the fire To do me hurt.” Withal she from her hand The morsel dropped and rising up a-stand, Said, “O my God, Thou that art God, alone Worthy of worship, now that Thou hast shown Me my desire of this man and my prayer Hast granted me for him and there no care Is left me upon earth, I pray Thee now Take Thou my soul to Thee forthright; for Thou Almighty art, Omnipotent!” And He Straight took her soul, His mercy on her be!” IV.The Golden Cup. Who has of Jaafer not, the Barmecide, Heard and how great and glorious far and wide He was from Oman to the China Sea? None other word for generosity Than “Jaafer” was in Araby and Ind, No name but Yehya's son for brave and kind. From Fars to Egypt one his noble name With virtue and with goodness was and same. There was none woeful, none opprest of fate, But found a refuge in his gracious gate: Asylum of the world, from Nishapour To Nile, he was and shelter of the poor. Yet (Alas! “therefore” were the fitter word; For when was it of virtue ever heard That long it prospered in this world of woe, Where worth and wisdom unregarded go And the mainsprings of life are spite and greed?) Death was untimely unto him decreed Of fickle Fate; for hate and envy wrought So sore against him in the jealous thought Of the sick tyrant whom he served too well That, like a thunderbolt, his terrors fell In ruin from the blue on Jaafer's head And sudden all save memory was dead Of that brave gallant soul, all blotted out From the sheer sunshine and the revel-rout Of light and air and sense and sight and sound Was that fair life and huddled underground Was that bright royal brow, those radiant eyes, That looked on men to gladden them, God-wise, That heart, which but with love and pity beat, Those lips, which nothing spoke but fair and feat, Those hands, which grace and goodness only wrought, That subtle brain, that all-embracing thought, Nought of these all abode but memory; And even memory by his decree Fain would that trembling tyrant from men's minds Have blotted out, lest, borne upon the winds, The mere rememorance of what they were, These noble Barmecides, the very air And breath of that their world-renowméd worth, Recalled, should yet avail to bring to birth Some shadow of their lives of love and light, Some phantom of their mild heroic might, Which should belike suffice to batter down The house of cards of his unstable crown, His hate and fear it not sufficing in The selfsame roll of death all Jaafer's kin, Man, woman, child, young, old, fruit, blossom, bud, To have writ down in characters of blood. Wherefore he let proclaim abroad and cry, In all the ways, to all the passers-by, That whoso dared to mourn for Jaafer dead Should share his fate with him and lose his head; And many an one, whom memory moved and faith To sorrow for the Barmecides, to death He merciless let put. But all in vain; For day and night, the mourning for the slain Rose up and cried against him to the sky; Yea, louder waxed the clamour and more high Till, frighted from Baghdad, himself and crew To Rakka by Euphrates he withdrew. There, from his closet-lattice looking down, One day, unseen, upon the teeming town, Beyond the cinctures of the market-place A ruined house he marked and in the space Before it, on a pillar-foot, which told Of where some goodly mansion stood of old, An old man mounted saw, with grizzled beard Wide-waving in the wind and arms upreared, And folk about him gathered in a crowd, To whom with speech right vehement and loud, As, though the distance dumbed it, manifest Was by his gestures, he himself addressed, And all the folk to passion moved, 'twas plain, (Although, for farness, he his ears in vain Enforced to catch the substance of his speech,) And pity with some sorrowful impeach. The Khalif, curious to know the cause Of that which tóward in the ruin was, One of his officers despatched thereto, Bidding him seek out that which was to do And eke the greybeard to his presence bring. The messenger, enquiring of the thing, Came in a little back with the old man Bound and “O scion of the Prophet's clan,” Said, “yonder ruined house of those is one Which heretofore pertained to Yehya's son, Jaafer ben Bermek, and this elder here, Mundir es Sádic highten, without fear Of God or reverence for thy decree, Which biddeth all leave grieving presently, On pain of death, for Jaafer and his race, Still at this hour each day takes up his place Yonder, where Jaafer's mansion was whilere, And to the general ear doth there declare The graces and the greatness of the dead, With many a groan and sigh and much tears shed, Dead Jaafer's deeds and virtues telling o'er And heartening the people, with great store Of instances, to mourn for him full sore And cry to God against his slayer, thee.” Thereat the horseshoe vein (the Háshimi Hight, for to Háshim, father of the race, Mohammed's grandsire, the grim feature trace The sons of Abbas, so the people tell,) Sudden between the Khalif's brows did swell, In sign and token sure of wrath to be, And anger overcame him like a sea. Wherefore he presently commanded bear Old Mundir to the ruin back and there Him straightway crucify in all men's sight, For warning to the folk. But that strange wight, Claiming the boon, which no man may deny, Of speech allowed, to those about to die, A tale so pitiful, so sweet, so sad, Of misery redeemed and grief made glad, Of ruin told retrieved and dead distress Brought back to life, of hope and happiness By the fair force of faith and sympathy, Of loving kindness and nobility, New-made, of a soul's winter unto spring By one man's hand returned, depicturing Dead Jaafer's goodness with so shrewd a touch Of longing lovefulness, with passion such And wistful memory, that none dry-eyed, For the remembrance of the Barmecide, In all that company there might abide. Nay, as of God Most High it was decreed, Even on the stony soul of Er Reshíd His sad true speech took hold, with love's mild heat Melting the ice of hate and self-conceit, And did its hardness on such sort surprise That the tears welled in his unwonted eyes, The old man's story all the love and truth Of that brave gallant comrade of his youth, That loyal counsel of his riper years, That faithful sharer of his hopes and fears, Recalling to his unaccustomed thought: Yea, on such wise it stirred in him and wrought Upon his hardened heart and brain that he Withal to Mundir life and liberty Not only did vouchsafe, but, catching up A great gold jewel-studded drinking-cup, That on the credence-table stood thereby, And it with bright broad pieces brimming high, Into his hands bestowed it, saying, “These Have thou of me for thy necessities,” And paused, as thanks expecting for the gift. Yet Mundir, as to heaven he did uplift The costly boon, no word of gratitude Vouchsafed the monarch for the gifted good, But cried, with eyes tear-streaming, “Even this, This, also, of thy bounties, Jaafer, is!” V.By the token of the Bean. Haroun el Abbasi, hight Er Reshíd, (Which is to say the Orthodox,) decreed, Whenas he Jaafer slew, the Barmecide, That whoso mourned him should be crucified; Wherefore the folk, affrighted, at the least From open tears and public mourning ceased; But in their hearts they sorrowed none the less For the great house of Bermek, and the stress Of their resentment, waxing day by day, Drove from Baghdad Haroun at last away. Now in a far-off desert there abode A Bedouin, who every year an ode In Jaafer's honour made and therewithal Came to the mighty Vizier's presence-hall And to reward of Jaafer having had A thousand dinars of largesse, full glad, Unto his desert gat him back again And there with all his family was fain To live in plenty till the coming year. So, when the end of the twelfth month was near, The man his desert, with the wonted rhyme, Departed and at the accustomed time Came to Baghdad and finding Jaafer dead, Betook himself to where, without a head, His body hung upon the gallows-tree, And there, his camel causing bend the knee And lighting thence the gibbet down before, Wept grievously and sorrowed passing sore. Then, in the honour of his patron dead, His ode he did rehearse and with his head Upon the bare earth pillowed, there down lay, Thinking to watch. But, with the travelled way And grief forwearied inexpressible, At unawares and fast on sleep he fell. And as he slept and nothing saw or heard, Jaafer the Barmecide to him appeared, As in a dream it had been, and “Behold, Thyself thou hast forwearied, as of old, To come to us and honour us,” said he, “And findest us, alack! as thou dost see. But, when thou wakest, to Bassora go And there for such an one, hight so and so, Among the merchants of the place enquire And having sought him out, of my desire Possess him, saying unto him from me, Jaafer the Barmecide saluteth thee And bids thee, by the token of the bean, Since he himself is dead and beggared clean, A thousand dinars give of thine avail Unto this Bedouin and do not fail!” Then with his hand to him, as who should say, “Farewell!” he signed and melted clean away. The Bedouin, awaking, of his dream Remembered him and on the Tigris stream Forthright embarking, to Bassora fared And there, the merchant found, to him repaired And him of Jaafer's words and will possessed. Which when he heard, he wept, as if his breast The soul for sorrow should depart; then he, The stranger bringing to his house, days three Him for an honoured guest did entertain, And him, unto departure being fain, A thousand dinars gave and having laid Thereto five hundred other, “These,” he said, Are that which is commanded unto thee And the five hundred are a gift from me: And still, as thou from Jaafer hadst of old Each year a thousand dinars of good gold, So, whilst I live, imbursement of the same Thou shalt of me receive, in Jaafer's name.” The Bedouin for all his gifts and grace Rendered him thanks; then, ere he set his face His desert-ward, conjured him by God's sheen The history to tell him of the bean, So he might know the manner of the thing. “With all my heart,” the merchant, answering, Began and told him what is here set down. “Know that of days bygone in Baghdad town I dwelt and being miserably poor, By hawking hot boiled beans from door to door, Was fain to earn my dole of daily bread. Now, one cold rainy day, when overhead Was nought but clouds and all the streets about Were mud and mire-water, I sallied out; And as I went, with cold and hunger pined, And shivered in the freezing rain and wind, For I upon my body clothes enough Had not to fend me from the weather rough, Now stumbling in the pools of fallen rain, Now splashing through the mire and out again, And altogether in such piteous plight, As whoso saw must shudder at the sight, It chanced that Jaafer, from an upper room, Where, with his officers and cupmates, whom He most affected, he that day did sit, Looked forth; and as his eyes upon me lit, He took compassion on my sorry case And sending out a servant, of his grace, To bring me in to him, he bade me sell My beans to those his people. So I fell My merchandise to meting presently Out with a measure which I had with me; And each who took a measureful did fill The empty vessel with gold pieces, till The basket empty was of all I had. Then, as to gather up the money, glad In that which I had gotten, I bethought Myself and go, quoth Jaafer, “Hast thou aught Of beans yet left?” “I know not,” I replied And in the basket sought on every side, But found, however straitly I might look, One only bean remained. This Jaafer took And splitting with his finger-nail in twain, Did for himself one half thereof retain And to his favourite, who sat therenigh, The other gave, “For how much wilt thou buy,” Saying, “this half-a-bean?” And “For the tale Of all this coin twice-told it shall avail,” Quoth she. Whereat to wondering I fell And in myself, “This is impossible,” Said; but as I, confounded, there did stand, She unto one her handmaid gave command, Who brought me presently the whole in gold. “And I,” said Jaafer, “for the tale twice-told Of this and that my half thereof I e'en Will buy.” Then, “Take the price of this thy bean,” He said to me. Therewith, at his behest, One of his servants, adding to the rest The sum thereof twice measured, as he bade, The heaped-up monies in my basket laid; And I, o'ermuch amazed by word or look To show my gratitude, the basket took And back withal unto my lodging fared. Thereafter to Bassora I repaired, Where with the bounty of the Barmecide Myself to trade and commerce I applied; And God the Lord Most High hath prospered me, To Him the praise, to Him the glory be! So, if a thousand dinars I a year Of Jaafer's bounties give thee, never fear 'Twill straiten neither irk me anywhat.” And he who tells the tale (I mind me not His name) for ending adds, “Consider now The nobleness of Jaafer's soul and how Extolled and glorified, alive and dead, He was, God's mercies be upon his head!” VI.The two Cakes of Bread. A certain king once proclamation made Unto the people of his realm and said, “Know that 'gainst almsgiving I've set my thought; Wherefore his hands, who giveth alms of aught, Will I cut off.” Whereat from almsgiving The folk forbore, for terror of the king, And none might give an alms of anything. One day unto a certain woman came A beggar and besought her in God's name Give him to eat; and “How shall I,” quoth she, “Give thee to eat, seeing the king's decree Is that who giveth alms of aught shall feel Upon his either hand the hangman's steel?” But he forbore her not and round her feet Clinging, conjured her, “Give thou me to eat By God most High, who all things ordereth! For I am hungered even unto death.” And she, when thus she heard him her conjure, Against his prayer no longer might endure, But, “What God willeth be with me!” she said And gave him of her store two cakes of bread. When to the king this her transgression known Became, he summoned her before his throne And for her trespass against his commands Reproaching her, let strike off both her hands And sent her back, thus maimed, unto her place, Where she was like to starve, except God's grace, The people's hearts toward her softening, Had boldened them to disobey the king, So that they pity on her plight did take And fed and tended her for heaven's sake. Then the case came to the king's mother's ear, Who brought her to the palace in to her And unto her rich gifts and raiment gave; Yea, for herself she took her to her slave And taught her with her feet to serve and spin. And for that she was chaste and clean from sin, God lent her lovesomeness and made her fair Of face and sweet of speech and debonair, Beyond all other women, of demean. Now the king minded was to take a queen And to his dam discovering his thought, Some damsel fair to find him her besought Enough and good and gracious for his bed, Whom he unto his lawful wife might wed And set her by his side upon the throne. Quoth she, “No need to look beyond our own. Here, in a palace of thy palaces, Among the women in my service is A maiden more of price than gems and gold, Fairest of all fair women to behold: But one default she hath and passing sore, In that her two fair hands have heretofore Been cruelly hewn off.” Whereunto he, “Nay, bring her forth to me and let me see.” So out to him she brought her and the maid Sweet-faced and shining as the moon displayed. And he of her forthright enamoured fell And took her to his wife and loved her well And lay with her; and ere a year was done, The maid conceived by him and bore a son. Now this was she whose hands cut off had been For almsgiving; and when to be his queen The king of all the land did her prefer, The women of the palace envied her; And when thereafterward a son she bore, Their jealousy went waxing more and more, Till at the last they counsel each with each To work her ruin took; and to impeach Her to her husband of adultery They presently together did agree. Wherefore, with lying letters to the king, Who for the nonce was absent, warraying Against his foes in a far distant land, They gave him guilefully to understand That she, whom he had wived and made his queen, Was of her body blemished and unclean And that the child which she had borne was none Of his begetting, but another's son. He, credit to their false advertisement Vouchsafing, letters to his mother sent, Into the desert that his wife unchaste Bidding her bear and leave her in the waste, To die of hunger. The old queen obeyed Her son's behest and carried, as he said, The damsel to a desert far away, Where never any came by night or day, And having bound the child about her neck, There left the twain to perish without reck. The damsel fell to weeping bitterly For that which had befallen her; then she (For she was parched with thirst) went wandering Hither and thither, seeking for some spring Where she might drink, and coming presently Unto a running river, on her knee (The child upon her bosom hanging still) Knelt down thereby, to drink thereof her fill, Well nigh forspended being with excess Of thirst, for sorrowing and weariness. But, as she stooped and bent her head to drink, The child into the water at the brink Fell from her neck and nought might she avail To save it, for the hands to her did fail. Then sat she weeping sore for that her child, And as she wept, alone in that vast wild, There came two men to her and saw her sad And asked her why she wept. Quoth she, “I had But now a child about my neck and he Is fallen in the water, woe is me!” Then said they, “Wilt thou that we bring him out To thee?” And “Yea,” she answered; “without doubt.” So unto God Most High they prayed and lo! The child came forth the river evenso And safe and sound was unto her restored. Then to her said they, “Wilt thou that the Lord Give thee thy hands again, as erst they were?” “Surely,” quoth she; whereat they offered prayer To God, extolled and hallowed be His name! And she her hands again, yet not the same, Received, but goodlier than they were by far. Then said the two men, “Know'st thou who we are?” “Nay, God alone all-knowing is,” she said; And “We,” quoth they, “are thy two cakes of bread, Which on the beggar thou bestow'dst whilere And of the cutting-off thy hands which were Th' occasion. Wherefore unto God Most High Praise do thou render, for that at thy cry, Thy child and eke thy hands He hath restored.” So praise and thanks she rendered to the Lord And glorified His might and majesty. And eke, thereafterward, by His decree, The king her husband, to his realm when he Returned and came to know her innocence, Her enemies and enviers banished thence And seeking out his exiled wife, was fain To take her to his bosom back again. VII.The Hermit's Heritage. One of God's friends aforetime I besought, To tell me what it was with him that wrought To leave the world and turned his heart and soul Unto the service of the One, the Whole. “With all my heart,” he said and thus began: “Erst on the Nile I was a ferryman And there for hire, to earn my living, plied Betwixt the Eastern and the Western side. One day, upon the hither bank await, After my wont, for custom, as I sate, I, chancing on one side to turn my glance, An old man saw of a bright countenance, In a patched gown attired and in his hand A gourd-bottle and staff, before me stand, Who with “Peace be on thee!” saluted me And I his greeting rendered him. Then he, “Wilt thou for God's sake give me,” said, “to eat And after ferry me, before the heat Wax greater, over to the thither side?” And I, “With all my heart I will,” replied. So he sat down with me and drank and ate, And after, entering my boat, there sate, Whilst to the other bank I rowed him o'er. But, ere he rose from me to go ashore, He said to me, “I have a trust, on thee Which I would lay.” Quoth I, “Say on,” and he, “Know that the hermit such an one am I And it hath been of God the Lord Most High Revealed to me that now my end is nigh And that to-morrow morning I shall die. Wherefore to-morrow, after noon, to me Do thou come over and beneath yon tree Thou of a surety shalt find me dead. Wash me and in the shroud, beneath my head Which thou shalt find, enfold me; then, at hand, Dig me a grave hard by and in the sand Bury me, having first prayed over me. But take my bottle, staff and gown to thee And presently deliver them to one Who shall come to thee, with the next day's sun, And shall of thee require them and receive.” This having said, he took of me his leave And going, left me wondered at his word. That day no more of him I saw nor heard And on the morrow, by I know not what Diverted from remembrance, I forgot What he had said, until the time drew nigh The hour of afternoontide prayer, when I, Remembering me, to the appointed place Hastened and found him dead with shining face Under a palmtree, and beneath his head A new shroud folded, that a fragrance shed Of musk. I washed and shrouded him and prayed O'er him, then dug a grave for him and laid His body there and covered it with sand; Then, his gourd-bottle, staff and gown in hand Taking, back to the Western side I rowed And there, as of my wont, the night abode. Next day, as soon as with the risen sun The city-gate was opened, there came one To me, a young man, whom I knew by ear For a lewd fellow and a chamberer, Clad all in gold-wrought silk, hands henna-dyed, Aloes and ambergris on every side Breathing, and said, “Art thou not so and so, The ferryman?” “Ay am I,” quoth I, “trow.” “Then,” said he, “give me that which thou for me In trust hast.” “What is that?” asked I; and he, “The gown, the bottle and the staff, to wit.” And I, “Who told thee,” said, “of them and it?” Quoth he, “A friend of mine yest'reven made A marriage-banquet and thereunto bade His fellows and among his fellows, me. So I and all the merry company Did eat with him the marriage-meats and spent The night in wantoning and revelment And carolling and mirth till hard on day, When down, to sleep and take my rest, I lay. And as I slept, behold, beside me one With countenance resplendent as the sun There stood and said unto me, “Know, my son, That God Most High hath taken such an one The hermit to Himself, of His great grace, And hath appointed thee to fill his place. Wherefore do thou forthright to so and so The ferryman, when thou awakest, go And at his hands the dead man's gear receive, Gourd, gown and staff, which he with him did leave For thee.” ” Whereat to him I brought them out And he, his raiment doffing, the patched clout Did on and bade me sell his silken wede And widows with the price and orphans feed. Then, taking leave of me, the staff and gourd He took and went without another word. And I for wonder and for pity fell A-weeping; but, that night, as I slept well, The Lord of Glory (hallowéd be He And blesséd!) in a dream appeared to me And “O My servant, is it grievous,” said, “To thee that I have granted, as he prayed, One of My servants to return to Me? Nay, this is of My bounties, verily, That I to whom vouchsafe and when I will, Who all things at My pleasure can fulfil.” And I withal, from sleep awakening, Did make and say the verses following; The lover with the Loved of will bereft is quite: All choice to thee's forbid, if but thou know aright. Whether to thee He grant favour and grace or hold Aloof from thee, no wise may blame upon Him light. His very rigours, nay, except thou glory in, Away! thou hast no call to stand with the contrite. Know'st not His presence from His absence? Then art thou In rear and that thou seek'st in front and out of sight. If I be haled away to slaughter for Thy sake Or, yearning, yield Thee up the last spark of my spright, 'Tis in Thy hand. Hold off, grant or deny; 'tis one: At that which Thou ordain'st 'tis vain to rail or flite. No aim in this my love I have but Thine approof: So, if aloof Thou will to hold, 'tis good and right. VIII.The Mad Lover. (Quoth Aboulabbas the grammarian, In all Chaldea is no wiser man,) I once did journey with a company To El Beríd in Mesopotamie, And by the Convent of Heraclius We lighted down midway, to hearten us And in the shadow of the walls to shun Somedele the midday fierceness of the sun. And presently there came us out unto A servant of the monastery, who With us full instant was to enter there, For that therein in keeping madmen were, He said, “and of them one who speaketh store Of wisdom, such as ye will wonder sore To hear.” So we arose and entering, Came, after seeing this and th' other thing, Unto a cell where one apart from all Sat with bare head and gazed upon the wall Nor turned, to see who entered in, his eyes. We gave him greeting, true-believer-wise, And he our salutation rendered us Again, but was nowise solicitous To cast an eye on us, nor turned his head To view us. Whereupon the servant said, “Prithee, some verses unto him say ye; For, when he heareth verse, then speaketh he.” So I what best to mind recall I might, In praise of God's Apostle, did recite; And he toward us, hearing what I said, Turning his face, with these his answer made: God indeed knoweth I am sore afflicted: I suffer so, I may not tell the whole. Two souls I have: one in this place is dwelling: Another country holds my second soul. Meseems the absent one is like the present And suffers under the same weight of dole. Then unto us, “Have I said well or not?” Turning, he questioned us; and I, “God wot, Thou hast said well and passing well,” replied. Then he put out his hand and from his side Took up a stone; whereat we fled from him, Ourselves misdoubting of his antick whim, Lest it belike at us he should have cast. But therewithal to beating hard and fast Upon his breast he fell and “Fear ye not,” Said; “but draw nigh and hear from me somewhat I have it now in mind to say to you: Receive it ye from me.” Wherefore we drew Again anigh him, putting off affright, And he the ensuing verses did recite: When they made their beasts of burden kneel, as day grew nigh and nigher, Then they mounted and the camels bore away my heart's desire. When mine eyes perceived my loved one through the crannied prison-wall, Then I cried, with streaming eyelids and a heart for love afire, “Turn, thou leader of the camels: let me bid my love farewell!” For her absence and estrangement, life and hope in me expire. Still I kept my troth and failed not from her love. Ah, would I knew What she did with that our trothplight, if she kept her faith entire! Then, “Know'st thou what she did?” To me he said; And I, “Ay do I,” answered; “she is dead.” Whereat I saw his face change, hearing me, And to his feet he sprang and “Out on thee!” He cried. “'Fore heaven, say, how knowest thou That she is dead?” And I, “If she yet now Did live, she had not left thee in this place To pine for lack of her.” “By God, the case That changeth, thou art right,” he answered, “sir; And I care not to live on after her.” Therewith his body shook and on his face He fell and stirred not. Then unto the place We ran and raised him softly from the ground And shook and called him, but in vain, and found Him dead. So over him with tears mourned we And buried him in peace. Then, presently Leaving the convent, unto El Bérid I journeyed on and having done my need, Back in due season to Baghdad did fare And going in unto the Khalif there, El Mutawekkil, he by chance the trace Of late-shed tears espied upon my face And questioned me of what the cause might be. So unto him the piteous history Of the poor madman all I did relate; Whereat he sorrowed, for his piteous fate To him was grievous. Then to me, “What whim Moved thee to deal thus cruelly with him? By Allah, did I think that of intent Thou hadst done this,” he said, “I punishment Would lay on thee!” And sent his court away And mourned for the mad lover all that day. THE LAST OF HERCULES. THE purple splendours of the dying sun Flamed on the sombre emerald of the hills And all the streams ran crimson to the sea, As with the ebbing life-blood of the day. Snow-white the village nestled to the flanks Of one tall cliff, that sloped its slow ascent Toward the fading glories of the sky, As if to catch the mantle of the light Upon its crownéd head; and from the walls The curving beach swept with its silver shells To meet the long slow ripples of the sea; Whilst, far and wide, the golden sky was cleft With mountains and a purple trail of woods Linked all the valleys with the gradual crests. It was the vineyard-harvest. All the vines Showed brown and naked and the clustered grapes Lay on the osiers in great jewelled heaps, Until the press should rob them, with the morn, Of all the sunshine hoarded in their globes. The folk were tired of festival and dance And lay upon the herbage, weary-wise, Watching the hazy glitter in the air, As in the west the Delian's golden car Paused in the purple portals of the night. Here children clustered round a greybeard sire, Who droned out legends of the bygone days, With many a gloss born of the newer time. There youths and maidens gathered in a ring And wove rose-garlands for the morrow's wine And sang in alternation to the harp. One measured out a hearty rustic song, A hymn to Bacchus of the country-side, And all the folk caught fire and clapped their hands And “Iö Bacche!” shouted, till the hills And woodlands flung them back the jovial clang. And then another took the harp and sang A wise sad song of Love and Death and Fate And of the linking harmonies of life; And as he sang, his hand compelled the strings To silver-sweet rebellions, that did wait, With grave majestic rhythm, on the slow Long-cadenced phrases of the stately song. The lofty music wound about their hearts, And as its sweetness lengthened on the air And with a wailing cadence passed away, A charm of sadness fell upon them all And there was silence for a little space. Then one, “Enough of songs. Let Lychnis tell The story of her meeting in the wood Two Springs agone;” and pointed to a girl, Slight with the drooping grace of some fair weed, Who sat a little from the rest apart And with a dreamy languour in her eyes, Plucked idly at the petals of a rose. And she, half-startled at her conscious thought, Blushed shrinkingly, as loath to open out Some delicate flower-secret of her soul And soil its sweetness with the general gaze; Then, with a shy sweet laugh at her own fears, Shook off her shame and told the tale they asked. “It was in that blithe birth-time of the months, When Dionusos bursts the winter's chains And all things feel renewal of their youth And flower toward the aspect of the sun, I, tending goats upon the woodward slope, Was ware of one stray kidling, that afar Had wandered from the flock and gleefully, Rejoicing in its foolish liberty, Did frisk and gambol on the forest's edge. The little thing was somewhat dear to me, Being as white as wind-flowers newly-blown And tame beyond the usance of its kind; And so it pleased me not that it should stray So far toward the tangles of the wood, Where haply it might wander on and on, Until it lost the instinct of return. I mounted leisurely the slow ascent, Thinking the kid would know me by my voice And come for calling; but, as I drew near, It gazed on me an instant with large eyes And bent its head a moment to the brook, That gurgled 'twixt the intertrellised trunks, Then started off into the deepest wood, Making the hidden echoes of the place Ring with the silver tinkle of its bell. I followed in the pathway of the sound, Half fearful of the unknown things that lay Within that solemn shadow of the trees;— Not that I looked to light on aught more strange Than some stray Dryad peeping from the brake Or haply Fauns a-gambol in the fern, That should flee from me, fearful as myself;— But some vague awe had ever held me back From searching out the secrets of the grove. The forest wore its raiment of the Spring, And all around was very fair to see And filled me with a wondering delight. In all the cool green glades, lush hyacinths Did robe the earth in purple, golden-starred,— Fit carpet for the wood-nymphs' flying feet,— And violets scented all the woodland air. The crocus raised its flower-flames of the Spring And all the hollow places of the wood And all the humid borders of the stream Were marged and trellised with the liberal blooms. The sweet and reverend silence of the place, Unbroken save by some stray throstle's chirp And babble of the brooklet o'er the stones, Soon soothed my awe to gladness; and the fair And exquisite new life that lay around, The murmurous music in the blissful air And subtle sweetness of the blended scents O'erflowed my heart with some new ecstasy. And as I went, still following the bell, That led me to the deepest of the wood, I saw, across a little cloistered glade, That opened out abruptly in my front, A sudden snow of lilies on a bank. The breeze was heavy with their luscious breath; And as it grew on me, my sense was seized With such delight and with so sharp a wish To gather some great cluster of the bells And crush full fragrance from them with my lips, That, making tow'rd them with unthinking haste, I caught my sandal in a wild vine's trail, That ran from bole to bole across the glade, And fell face downward on the lily-bed. The sudden shock forced from my parted lips A cry of sheer amazement, as I tripped And lay among the flowers all pantingly. I plucked one handful of the tender bells, That, crushed and drooping, all the sweetlier smelt, And rose,— half-scared, half-laughing at my fears,— To go. But, as I stood upon my feet, I saw, outpeering from the neighbouring brake, A loathly hideous visage, horned and grim, That fastened on my face with hungry eyes, Lurid and red and glaring with desire, And two hooked hands that held the creepers back. I stood a moment, rooted to the earth With horror,— as a fowler in the marsh That lights upon a sudden baleful snake And cannot for awhile compel his feet Backward or forward, till the evil beast Creeps nearer and uncoils itself to strike;— And then the thing set up a gibbering cry And leapt, to seize me, out into the glade. Half-beast, half-man, with gaunt and shaggy shanks, Goat-hoofs and flanks a-bristle with red hair,— It was a Satyr, one of those foul pests That harbour in the inmost heart of green And poison all the pleasance of the wood. The imminence of terror lent me wings, And turning back, I fled across the glade To where the path sloped homeward. In the break Another Satyr met me in mid-race, E'en loathlier than the first one; and I, crazed With terror, cowered backward on the sward And hid my face between my trembling hands, Expecting momently to feel the clutch Of their foul claws upon my neck and loath To look upon the face of such a death. A second passed,— a life of years to me For agony,— and still no horny hand Did violate the tangles of my hair Nor tear the crimson chlamys from my neck; And listening,— hope half-awake again For the delay,— to hear how this should be, A tread that was no Satyr's smote my ears And human footsteps rustled through the leaves; Then, looking up, I saw the loathly pair Had taken refuge at the glade's far end And mopped and mowed with disappointed rage. But by my side there stood a fair-haired man, Goodly with noble limbs and locks of gold And tall beyond the use of mortal kind. Can I forget his beauty? Like a god For noble stature,— ay, a god indeed For eyes unfathomed as a mountain lake And the fair stainless valour of his port. Ah, how the weak words fail me to present The glory of his majesty! Full oft, When in the purple night I look upon The splendour of the sadness of the stars And weary waning silver of the moon, There rises up before my longing eyes The wise heroic sorrow of his face, That fills the flower-cells of my memory. He leant upon a club, and on his breast, Mighty with breadth and sinews mountainous, A tawny lion's skin, that lay across His ample shoulders, met and was confined Within two golden ouches, subtly wrought Into the semblance of a lion's claws. And as I looked on him with hare-like eyes, Half-glad, half-doubtful with astonishment, He laid his hand upon my upturned head And “Fear not,” said he; “thou art safe with me; See, yonder have they fled.” But, as he spoke, There came a crashing and a rending noise, As of a wild boar tearing through the brake, Before the eager dogs; and suddenly The glade was all alive with hornéd beasts, That made toward us slowly from all sides, As if to hem us in from all retreat. Then that fair hero raised me from the grass And set me up against a wide-girthed tree, One hand about my waist, the other leant Upon the knotted handle of his club, And waited, with his back against the stem. The foremost Satyr, seeing him so still, Waxed bold and bolder for his comrades' host, And with a sudden rush, thought to make shift To clutch me by the hair; but, as he passed Him of the lion's hide, the hero's hand Slid swiftly to the hilt and drawing out The broad brown blade, that glittered in the sun, Struck with the sharp steel straight at the bent neck. The keen death shore through all the knotted flesh And bit into the columns of the throat And the slit veins let out the felon life. Then all that rabble rout, dismayed to see Their fellow's fate, fled howling from the place And disappeared among the thick-set trees. But he, my saviour, turned his face to me And said, “Fair maid, now is thy fear forgone; Yet, haply, since the hollows of the wood May hold some terror still for thee within Their shadow, it behoveth me to bring Thee on thy homeward way, toward the sea, To where the wild wood ceases from the crests.” And I to him, “O hero! must the Fates Sever so hastily our crossing lives? May I not look on my deliverer One little hour? Wilt thou not stay awhile And look upon the faces of my kin And mingle but a day's time with our life? Wilt thou disdain to hear our foolish thanks And taste the last year's life-blood of our vines?” He looked upon me, with a rare sweet smile Rounding the perfect glory of his mouth, Awhile in silence; then, “It may not be, Sweet one,” he said; “I have long work to do And may not tarry in the flowered ways: — Work, for the waste earth wails to me for help; Work, for men's hearts do fail them for despair And all the air is faint with bitter wrong.” The valleys echoed with his hollow words, As the flute-sweetness mounted, gathering, Into the mellow thunder of the end; And from the rock-caves rang the answered speech And died in wailing murmurs, “Bitter wrong!” And failed with failing sweetness on the air. The strange wild music filled my soul with thought, Awhile too vague for speech to open out The dim mysterious petals of its bud: And then I raised my eyes and looked at his And saw in the clear depths a godlike pain, A glory of deep sadness, grave and sweet, And knew some god had fallen on my days And smitten their unthinking careless calm Of twilight with the sun-ray of his gaze And shown me all the fastnesses of life. Ay, a god surely, and belike, yet more, A man more god-like, nobler than a god; For such, they say, do sometimes walk the earth, Bridging the yawning chasms of the world, That careless freedom of Olympian rule And loveless rigour of the ruthless gods Have opened, with the silver of their deeds, Ay, and the splendid fulness of their lives. He stood before me all unconsciously, Holding the stretching landscape in his gaze, With deep mild eyes that drank the future in From where the crystals of the upper air Waved on the cloudless sapphires of the sky. And as I looked on him, my heart was sad And weary for the thought of his great task And the near parting from him: then, at last, “O conqueror of all the wrongs to be! O saviour of the piteous of the earth! O hero,” cried I; “if the speech of men And their poor words, that have so scant a power To shape their yearning, may enframe thy name And give its lofty sweetness to our ears, I pray thee let me hear it, that I may Embower it in the flower-nest of my heart And sweeten all my memories with its scent.” So I to him; and “I am he that bears The burden of the travail of the world And sadly compass the deliverance Of mortal men,” he said, “from weary weight And pain of toil against the harsh decrees Relentless of immortals and the stress Of ruthless Nature. I am Hercules, That work the world-wrongs wearily to right And have no hope of rest nor any joy Until the swift Fates snatch me to the stars.” Thus said he, as we went along the wood, For now the way drew homeward and the trees Thinned to the open summit of the hill. And as he spake, he, striding on before, Did clear the rocks and brambles from my way And held me back the stubborn undergrowth, That I might pass with robe inviolate. And when too soon we came to where the trees Showed sparsely 'gainst the blue nor hid from view The village roofs that sparkled in the sun, He stooped and kissed me twice between the eyes And turned into the tangles of the wood. So strode he tow'rd the sunset and I saw, Deep-written in the furrows of his brow, That men should look upon his face no more. And as I went a-musing down the slope Into the homeward path between the vines, The dim unspoken echoes of his thought Stirred in the secret places of my heart And whispered to me of the soul of things, The general doom of pleasure twinned with pain; How sorrow pairs with gladness, joy with grief And sweetest things have root in bitterest soil. Grape-clusters burn to purple in the sun, Forcing scant nurture from the painful earth, Grow ripe to fall before the harvest-knife And bleed beneath the unrelenting press, To gladden men with essence of their pain. The olive, dying, yields its golden oil And violets, for the binding of our brows, Die in the purple meshes of our hair And in a waning sweetness breathe out life. That man may build a house, the Dryad dies And many a kid must bleed that we may eat. Nor is it these alone whose gladness fails, That men may taste the sweetness of the day. Man lives by man and from his fellow's dole Gathers too oft the blossoms of his joy. How many slaves toil hardly in the sun And eat their bread in bitterness and woe, That he who rules may lie on rose-strewn lawns And dream beside the babble of the brook And crush a curious sweetness from the hours. How many feel the cold steel at their hearts Or wear the garb of dolour and despair, To weave one laurel for the victor's brow! This world of ours is edified with pain And built on bitter pedestals of wrong. E'en he who heals the fever of the time And smites the cankers at the heart of life Is not exempted from the general doom; For, while he rights the world, he wrongs himself, Seeing he has no gladness in his life. What others do for gladness, he for grief; And healing pain, he clasps it for himself. Sad cypress is the cincture of his brow And sorrow is the mistress of his soul. And the West answered with a wailing shout. And therewithal the daylight faded out And the black night fell down upon the trees And the cleft hill-tops. — So died Hercules; But some do feign that he shall come again In the fierce future times, when toil and pain And wealth weigh heavy on the loveless folk And the earth groans beneath the added yoke Of gold and iron till the skies bow down: Then shall he come again and claim his crown, Lord over men and light'ner of their woes, — Come from the shadowy realms that no man knows. —“The Death of Hercules.” — From an unfinished poem. USQUE AD PORTAS. MY soul had passed the valley of the tomb And stood before the foot of that steep hill Whose summit held the golden-gated town. The later way had been more hard for me And the swift hours had left the golden noon Far in the rearward distance, when my feet Began to tread the lily-blossomed banks Of that clear stream which rises from the heart Of the eternal chrysolite and flows Across the meadows at the mountain's foot. I paused and turning, looked across the slopes Of emerald, golden-blossomed, through whose grass, Bright with celestial dews, my feet had passed And washed away their tiredness, to the rim Of purple sea, that bound the golden breadth Of meadows at the uttermost extreme Of vision; and as I, half-fearfully, Looked back upon the perils I had passed, The day began to fade and all the air Grew purple with the presage of the night. A little valley cleft the lower hill, Where on the left the meadows rose to join The heavenward slope, all overhung with trees; And through its cool wood-glens and moss-grown dells The living stream ran over diamond sands, Flooding the tree-stems with its stainless lymph. Celestial quiet held the luminous glades, A calm engendered of untroubled peace; And as the waters rippled o'er the stones, Their song was as the everlasting harps, That cease not from the choirs of Paradise. Thither I turned me, till the assaining sun Should quicken Nature; for that the ascent Were hopeless in the darkness of the night, Under the vague direction of the moon; And as I reached its shades, the light died out And the blue heaven grew golden-flowered with stars. All night I lay upon a bed of moss, Whose hidden violets gave out sweetest scents, Like breath of some divinest soul in pain, And watched the clear stars keep the ward of heaven: And all night long I heard the throb of harps From out the city and the distant swell Of sweet unearthly singing from within The ramparts of the heavenly town and saw, Reflected in the mirror of the sky, The glory of that inocciduous light Agnus est felicis urbis lumen inocciduum.— Peter Damian's Latin Hymn. Which burns at heart of the Eternal's throne. My soul was not alone in that fair shade; For, as the starlight pierced the dusky air, Across the darkness I was ware of shapes, Whose vaporous semblance wore a human form And flitted through the shadow, and I felt The rush of pinions fan my lips and brow. The thought of ended toil and bliss to be, Half-tempered by a dim and formless doubt, Held back the balms of slumber from mine eyes; And in the peopled stillness of the night, My spirit trod the accomplished paths again, Hoped its dead hopes and feared past fears anew And fought afresh the battle of the years. Beneath my resting-place the endless plains, Through which my weary way but late had lain, Were visible to my unsleeping eyes; And when the dusk had blended all the hues Of various nature to one russet-gray, I saw my path of years defined in fire, A glimmering line that led athwart the night; And here and there a point flamed beacon-wise, Emblazoning the epochs of my life, Where had my soul been turned, for good or ill, Out of the years' worn channel. So I lay, Revolving all the chances of the past In fancy, till the silver-spangled gloom Of night began to merge into the grey Of early morning and the purple dusk Fled from the golden arrows of the light: The hills put on cloud-panoply of dawn And through the mists the amaranth of day Broke into flower across the Eastern crests. As soon as in the cool sweet morning air The sun had rounded out his golden globe, I rose and took my way, beside the stream, To where descent for it, for me ascent Of that high hill began, whereon my hope Incarnate rested, and with careful steps, Followed its course, with feet set contrary. Rugged and very toilsome was the way, Compelling my impatient feet to sloth; And oftentimes the windings of the stream, To whose direction instinct bade me trust, Hid from my sight all glimpse of heaven's bliss. The path ran through a tangle of dark woods And frowning cliffs; and ever, as I rose, The golden pinnacles seemed risen too And towered ever far above my head. At length, when light had passed the house of noon And the hot hours, that hold the rearward day, Flamed in the golden air, I, suddenly, Emerging from a thick and thorny brake, Stood on the threshold of those gates of gold That had so long been lodestars to my soul. Long expectation had not armed my hopes 'Gainst their long-wished fruition: very long I stood and in a trance of wonderment, Gazed mutely on those great resplendent leaves, Beneath whose bases, in a glittering sheet Of liquid crystal, ran the living stream. So rapt was I, my senses noted not A postern's soft unfolding and the approach Of one who came from innerward, until The glory of his visage warned my sight Of a celestial presence and his voice, Awful and sweet, made challenge to my soul Of why it stood before the gates of heaven. I looked and knew the angel of the Lord, That stood before me, fair and terrible In unimpassioned wisdom, and my tongue Awhile for awe clave to my mouth. At last I spoke. “O thou that hast the keys of heaven, Thou knowest all; thou knowest I am one Who through the tangles of the world hath striven, To sue for entrance at the gates of life.” But he, “Thou knowest, God gives nought for nought. What hast thou done for Him that merits heaven?” And I, “I have been careless of the world, Have counted earth and its delights as nought And set my hope on those eternal things That lie beyond the ether and the stars.” But he, “'Twas not well done of thee; the world, No less than heaven's glory, is the Lord's. Thou hast contemned God's creatures and thy sin Hast counted righteousness. Thy life was vain; Thou mayst not enter.” The hot tears gushed forth From my sad eyes and in a blind despair, I turned and fled upon the downward path Into the lower valley. With my hope, The day had faded and the gloom of night Enshrouded all the landscape, as I sank Again upon the violet-hearted moss, Worn with fierce toil and pain of my crushed hopes. “Despair not: hope and wait!” These words to me Were wafted through the thin and fluent air. I looked around, but saw no living thing Save those dim shapes, that flitted through the gloom, Incessant; and indeed it seemed as if No voice had spoken, but my formless hope Had taken shape and spoken to my thought. But, as I lay, the touch of two soft lips, —As soft as summer rose-leaves,—swept my brow And sleep fell down upon my weary soul. The shafts of dawn aroused me; in the air, All golden with the tender morning-glow, The balms of Spring breathed perfume and my soul Gathered new vigour with each liberal breath. Despair had left me with the waning night And hope, full-flowered, bloomed in my heart again. A hidden influence seemed to bend my steps Once more into the mountain-circling path And the cool grass was yet with golden dews Bejewelled nor the thirsty sun had drained The wine of heaven from flower-chalices, When on the heavenly threshold once again I stood and felt that shining one anew Challenge my purpose with his eyes of light. My spirit gathered courage, for meseemed His gaze was friendlier than of yesterday, Less rigid in its stainless clarity And awe of pure perfection. So, with less Of the first fear and trepidation, I To the grave question of his eloquent eyes, That in their starry silence clearliest spoke, Made answer, “I for mine own soul have solved The mazy tangles of the opposing faiths, That hinder many of the love of God, Have found the aim of the concentric creeds And seen how all are reconciled in Him, Who only is their centre and the fount Of their beneficent being. I have thought No one belief unblesséd, but have striven To find in each the hidden saving soul That medicines its weakness.” Thus I spoke And paused; but still the enquiring look ceased not From those angelic eyes; and I again, With added earnest emphasis, as 'twere Beseechingly, “I have been wise and strong, Have seen in all the interfusing good, Have known how every soul is very God, How life is death and death is life indeed, Have sucked the honey from the flowers of earth And sought for nectar from the blooms of heaven, That I might melt its sweetness into song And with the wilding balsam bless the world.” But he to me, “It is not yet enough; Thou mayst not enter yet.” My agony O'ermastered life and in a deathly swoon, I fell to earth; nor did recurrent sense Restore the motion to my palsied limbs, What while the daylight glittered in the sky. When I awoke, I felt the velvet moss Beneath me and I knew I lay again Upon the valley's sward. The day was gone; The gold and crimson standards of the West Had followed on the footsteps of the sun And all the hills and plains were overstrewn With twilight gloom; I saw the brooding dusk Hover above and the pale sapphire stars Kindle to splendour in the luminous air. That night I slept not; for alternate hope And fear held contestation in my breast. And in the quiet, the celestial choirs Sounded more clearly and their chanting seemed To strike a chord of triumphing, as 'twere Rejoicing o'er some new-beatified soul, About to cast off sorrow like a cloak And put on glory with the crown of life. So lay I through the unenlightened hours And in the middle watches of the night, When the moon's silver held the purple plains, One stood beside me, robed in living light, And spake sweet words to me, that were not sad, But fair and wise and comforting as flowers, When woodlands blossom in the break of May. I knew the piteous sweetness of that face, Which still on earth had been my type of heaven; I knew the tender radiance of those eyes, Which had in life been lodestars to my soul And drawn it to all manner of good work, And now, new-liberate from the clogs of earth, Shone with that stainless splendour they had sought And longed for in the life beyond the grave. Of many things she reasoned, comforting My troubled spirit with the golden speech, That lent fair vesture to the rapturous grace And beauty of her heaven-annealéd spright, And drew me back along my way of life, Making the sense of all things clear to me, So that I knew what had been fair in it And sweet and true and faithful and approved Of God and what ill-omened and unblest. And as I hearkened, lifting up mine eyes, I saw, where, on the far horizon's marge, The slant sky's azure joined the purple sea, A star that seemed to grow toward my sight, With an unresting swiftness, and before Its path of light, the clinging veils of mist Fled, as the dawn clouds flee before the sun; And whilst its passage clove the untroubled air, Leaving behind a wake of silver light, (As in the phosphorescent waves at night The keel's ploughed pathway glitters,) all the fair And seeming merits of my pictured life, Whereon I used to build my hopes of heaven, Fell in the shadow of that ceaseless light, Shade blacker for the brilliance of its cause, And dwindled into unenlightened gloom. But from the shadow many a modest flower, That erst had lain unnoticed in the blaze Of more pretentious blossoms, showed itself, Freed from the screen of interwoven mists, And put the roses of the world to shame. The things unreal withered from the light, Whilst, bright and constant, the eternal things Shone out, full-statured, in the silver flood. The ship of heaven failed not in its course, Until it reached the summit of a wood, Where, nestling in its inmost heart of green, The holiest holy of my being lay, All overshrouded with the webs of years. Here stayed the heavenly messenger its vans And pierced the dim recesses with the shafts Of its ethereal radiance. From my sight The mystery of life was no more hid; The secret place lay open, flooded full Of light; and in the deepest deep of green, I saw a fair white flower, that lay asleep, Within its sleeping silver-fronded leaves, And in the silence brimmed the air with balm. I knew the symbol of a deathless love, A love I scarce had heeded, but whose charm Hallowed my handwork with its quiet chrism And purified my yearnings in the life That lies to worldward of the icy flood. My eyes were opened to the eternal truth And a new knowledge overflowed my soul. A moment, anchored in the deep serene, The planet glittered; then, as suddenly As it had dawned upon me, disappeared And all the landscape wore the night again. I turned to look for that belovéd shape; But the swart air was void and in the calm No sound of voice or footstep smote my ear, But only that clear rillet o'er the stones Whispered in music to the listening stars. And now the signs of dawning flashed across The purple of the interstellar air; The day began to break the chains of night; And as the morning reddened all the sky, One spake to me, albeit none was near, And said, “Delay not; see, the sign of hope Undying glisters even at thy feet.” I looked and saw, enchased in emerald And gold of moss, a clear pellucid bell, That, for the vivid brilliance of its hue, Seemed moulded from the living diamond And bore at heart a tongue of golden flame, That through the petals blended with the light. I knew the asphodel of Paradise; And as I stooped to gather its sweet scent's Regeneration closelier, in the span Of my two palms, I saw another bell, Twin to the first, but even goodlier In seeming sheen, had cloven the green earth And beckoned to me with its spire of flame. I moved to pluck it, when, o wonderment! Beyond the attainéd blossom sprang a third, A fourth and after that, a host of blooms, Each of a fairer semblance than the last, And drew my feet upon the upward path, Regardless of the rigours of the way. So did I follow on the flowered track, With downcast eyes bent on the lavish blooms, As one who gathers cowslips, unawares, Is tempted by the richer-seeming bells That stand in endless sequence, till he finds He has, unknowing, wandered far away; Till suddenly the trail of blossoms ceased And I was ware of an increase of light, That drew mine eyes up from the spangled grass And made them quickly fall to earth again With its exceeding splendour; for there stood Before me he that held the gate of heaven And gazed upon me with his radiant eyes, In whose clear deeps a smileless sweetness shone, That raised my hopes to rapture. “Hast thou found, At last, the secret of Eternity, The chiefest crown and attribute of God? Holdest, at last, the very key of heaven, The word that opens life? Hast learnt, at last, What was most worthy in unworthiness Of thy probation-strife?” Thus he to me; And I, grown wise at last, “I have but loved, A little, oh, how little!” answer made; And the gold gates swung open at my touch. A crash of song aroused me. In the porch Of an old church I sat, whilst out of doors The quiring birds made carol to the May. Usque ad portas sang the inner choir; And from the gates of heaven came down my soul. THE PACT OF THE TWIN GODS. I. NOW Life and Death had striven many a day Which should have mastery Over all things that be Upon the earth and in the hollow deep; And for their endless strife The world was all perplexed And all the ordered harmonies of Life Ceased from the accustomed course of night and day, Being so vexed And worn with shock of battle and duresse. For whiles on all things lay, Living and dead, the sleep Of Death, when he sometime had brief success; And whiles the hollow breast Of the cold grave gaped wide And all the things which therewithin did bide Came forth and knew The passionate unrest Of life once more, When, in the course of war, The frank fair God from the funereal wight Did wrest The palm of fight. So that by turns there blew The icy blasts of death and the sweet soft Zephyrs of life About the world and there was endless strife Twixt God and God. The night, Erst sacred unto death, was filled and rife With birth and fluttering Of newborn life; And many a goodly thing, Glad with the joy of being, bloomed aloft Above the outraged portals of the grave. Death could no longer save The dead from stress and resonance of being And the pale ghosts, a-fleeing From out the tombs, uptorn By the swift God, to seek Some refuge in the crannies of the rock Or in the hill-caves bleak, Were caught up by the blast Of Life imperious and born Into new shapes of life and love and beauty And the old rack And whirl of earthly duty Claimed them again in yet another shape, Although the grave did gape To take their tired souls back To its cold breast And in the dim and stirless peace of death To give them their last rest. And in his turn did Death usurp the day And all the things Life had Of power and symbol, 'neath the risen sun; For he did glide, With his cold breath And frosted gaze, Across the meadows wide And the fair woodland ways, And touching all the things that had begun To open to the light Their buds and petals glad With the new morn, did slay The spirit of joy within their bosoms bright. Wherefore their hues did fail; The corn-sheaves' glitterance faded into gray; The woodbirds' delicate notes Did faint for fear And all sweet sounds, that rise, Under the flower-blue skies, From feathered throats, For the young day to hear, When the stern God swept darkling o'er the plain, Were fain To leave their life and wander, phantom-wise, Ghosts of themselves, droning sad songs of death. The heavens grew grey and drear; The very sun turned pale; The clouds put on a veil And fled across the gray Of the young blighted day, Like ghosts of Titans driven o'er the white Of the pale Infinite By the doom-angel's breath. Beneath the heaven's shroud, Men knew not if they died And had no joy in being, if allowed To live; for still a wraith Of death was over life And a gold gleam of life did blazon death. One great grave was the earth; The grave was full of birth: Even in the birth was rife The ghastliness of dying And the delight of mirth, Of being and its gladness, Blent with the ghosts' shrill sighing And the death-sadness. So was there endless strife, By land and sea, Twixt the Gods Death and Life; And unto neither fell the mastery. II. Thus did it chance, one middle Summer's day, The twin Gods met Within a valley, set Twixt two great ridges of the Westward hills; And through the gorge there lay, Midmost the woods thick-sown upon the side Of the sloped cliffs, two wide, Fair-seeming rills, Whereof the one was clear And bright and swift and glad And without haste or fear, Fled singing o'er its sands, Between thick-woven bands Of many-coloured flowers Of all sweet sorts that come with summer hours. So clear a soul it had That one could see fair fish therein at play, Golden and emerald and ruby-red And topaz and clear blue And many another hue Of glad and glancing scales; and all its way Was busy with bright things and gay and rife With winged and footed life, That glittered as it sped. The other one was sad And deep and sombre-hued And none had ever viewed The bottom of its bed. Beside it grew no blooms Nor in its flood was any moving thing, That unto mind might bring The memories of life; but all its stream Was full of strange dim glooms And sombre mysteries And all its waves did seem To murmur of death's shade And the repose that lies Behind the folded portals of the night. Yet not withal was aught Of enmity between The neighbouring rills. Despite Their difference, both sought The same fair end And through the jewelled green Of that calm valley's grass Did wend Their sidelong way in careless amity, Until they joined and fell Into a clear blue mere And in its heaven-hued glass Put off their difference And thought no shame in that fair lymph to be Made one in peace. III. Then those two Gods, that came Together, like a flame Of war intense, Thinking to end their strife And solve the struggle for omnipotence With one great effort, saw These two, as different As Death and Life, That, natheless, side by side, In amity did glide And at the last their murmuring currents blent In all delight of peace; And with that fair fulfilment of God's law Of natural harmony ravished, they did cease To breathe out flame and war: Each for awhile gave o'er His enmity and gazed Into his fellow's eyes with mind perplexed, Half vexed With some old remnant of despite And half amazed With a new sense of right And possibility: And each could see The nascent softness of a new desire, Dim-radiant within The other's eyes, For rest from all the din And weariness of strife. Then, on this wise, After a resting-while, Unto the frosty sire Spake, with a dawn-sky's smile, The great God Life, Saying, “My brother, What boots it that so long We have done hurt unto each other And to the world And have so often and so sore wrought wrong To the sad race of men,—that we have hurled The fair sky-orders from their base with fight, So I, a God, of thee, another God As great, might have the mastery? Now, of a truth, I see That we are surely equal in our might And all these years have trod The battle all in vain; For Death and Life must be And may not change or wane Nor the one have domain Over the other's fee. Wherefore I pray of thee that we do take Joined hands once more And make A thing that shall be for a covenant Betwixt us against war And lawless strife; A thing that shall of both our souls partake And all our attributes Shall share, As a fair tree that, by the gardener's knife Graffed to a plant of various kind, doth bear Twy-natured fruits; A thing that shall be sad as violets' breath And blithesome as the breeze That in the Spring Among the blossomed trees Doth float and sing; That shall be sadder and more sweet than Death And gladder and more sweet than Life, That as a king betwixt us twain shall sit And with flower-bands Linking our hands, Shall lead us forth upon our various way, As two fair twins that play With joinéd hearts and lives together knit And have no thought of harm.” And so the pact was sworn between the two, That they should work to do This charm; And Life and Death clasped hands on it. IV. Then Life brought flowers and breezes and sun-gold And juices of the vine; And Death brought silver of the moonlight cold And the pale sad woodbine. Life brought clear honey of the buxom bees And fruits of autumn-time; And Death brought amber from the murmuring seas And fretwork of the rime. God Life did rob the jasmine of its balm, Death the pale lily's bells; Life brought a handful of the summer-calm, Death of the wind that swells And sighs about the winter-wearied hills; Life the Spring heaven's blue, Death brought the grey, that in the autumn fills The skies with its sad hue. And with these things of mingling life and death Did the twin Gods upbuild A golden shape, which drew the goodliest breath That ever bosom filled: For it was lovesome as the risen sun And pale as ended night, Glad as the glance of an immortal one And mild as the moon's light. The form of it was white as is the snow, When the pale winter reigns, And rosy-tinted as the even-glow, After the April rains. The charm of day was in its violet eyes And eke the spells of night; Therein one read of the gold Orient skies And the faint Spring's delight. And for a voice Life lent it all the tune That from lark-throats doth rise; And pale Death added to it, for a boon, The sad sweet night-bird's sighs. Its hands were warm as life and soft as death, Rosy as flowers and white As the pale lucent stone that covereth The graves in the moon's sight. Its hair was golden as the sheer sun's shine, When the hot June rides far, And tender-coloured as the hyaline Of the pale midnight star. Red was its mouth as is the damask rose And purple as night-shade, Most glad and sad, fulfilled of lovesome woes And joys that never fade. Swift were its rosy golden-sandalled feet, Yet lingering as the night, And the soft wings that on the air did beat Were of the windflower's white. And on its head they set a double crown, Golden and silver wrought, Wherein sweet emeralds for hope were sown And amethysts for thought. Thus did the two Gods make this lovesome thing, To stand betwixt them twain; And therewithal they crowned the fair shape king O'er them and suzerain. And from that time there hath no more been strife 'Twixt these two Gods of might; For evermore betwixten Death and Life That creature of delight Hath gone about the weary worldly ways, Holding them hand in hand, So that Death never on a mortal lays His finger, but there stand Beside him Life and that sweet shape which they Have for their master made; And on like guise, when dawn hath lit the day, Death walketh in the shade, Hard by the sun and all the gauds of life: And by them, without cease, The winged shape goes and orders all their strife To harmony and peace. And if one ask which God he cherisheth His brother God above, Methinks his heart beats franklier for Death; For lo! his name is Love. ANCHISES. THE gold of sunset flickers on the rim Of the gray deep and in the Western sky I see the funeral torches of the day Flare tow'rd extinction. In the twilight-calm I lie and feel the burden of the years Weigh down my spirit to the eternal shades And see the stern Fates beckon from the gloom With their unswerving fingers. Yet my soul Lingers within these weary weeds of flesh, Held in the links of an impalpable chain. The pale dusk hovers o'er the sullen sea And in the West the purple pall of night, Spangled with silver, covers up the corpse Of the dead day. I smell the night-flowers' scent, A sweetness as of death, and in the air, Hazed with the subtle colours of the gloom, A living silence wavers. One by one, The pale stars glitter through the purple mists And their grave eyes, so dreadly fair to me, That looked upon Mount Ida in the heart Of that enchanted summer, when my life Flowered with the ardours of a heavenly love, Gaze down upon the dying gray-haired man With the same loveless pity as of yore, When he, a youth, sought in their cold serene Of light some sympathy with his hot dreams Of passionate ecstasy and sought in vain. And lo! she comes, upon her radiant car, Herald of night and morn. I feel her rays Of cold keen splendour smite upon my heart And stir my spirit to the old unrest. O star of eve, hast thou forgotten all, All that thy lips once breathed to me of love, All that thine eyes once looked of passionate bliss? Hast thou no memory of the vanished time When I, a boy, that dared look up to heaven And daring, captived an immortal's love, Lay on the flower-wrought broidery of the grass And watched the golden sparkles of the sun Fade from the rippled azure of the sky? (Ah me, how laggard seemed the thought-swift dusk To me whose day dawned in the blank of night!) Hast thou forgotten how I used to wait, Stretched out upon the clustered hyacinths, And tore the star-cups from the spangled grass, In my hot longing, till the purple gloom Flowered with the sudden splendour of thy face And all the air grew fragrant with thy breath? How thou wouldst fall into mine eager arms, As apple-blossoms fall on Spring-green sward, And all my soul drank rapture from thy kiss, Fatal and sweet? O cruel that thou wast To lift me to the glory of thy love, To make a God of me with thine embrace, Then let me lapse from that hot heaven of bliss Into the cheerless cold of mortal wont And dull mean sameness of the loveless world! Three deaths before the body's death I die; The death of hope, the death of hopeless love And (worst of all) the death of memory, That mystic consort of the undying soul, That, dying, lives in death an awful life. O snow-white splendour of encircling arms, Warm ivy that did cluster round my neck! O rose-mouth in the rose-time that wast wont To lavish kisses on my thirsting lips! O dew-soft deeps of amethystine eyes, Wherein my spirit saw its mirrored self, Transfigured as with an immortal joy! I have no memory of you; all my pains, My weary, longing pains may not suffice To win one glimpse of your divine delights From the grim shadow of the pitiless Night. O star of eve, that wast my light-bringer! O Hesperus, that wast my Phosphorus! O queen of love! The inexorable years Have blotted out thy beauty with the films Of their fast-falling silences. I yearn To drink once more the fatal brilliance Of that bright face, those starry, lustrous eyes, And weary in the fruitless strife to shape My agonizing longing into form. And yet I would not murmur at my doom, Did but the memory of the bygone pain Shrink from me with the unremembered bliss. Alas! the agony of that fatal night, When through the dragging midnight hours I lay And waited for thy coming, that was ne'er Again to bless my vision, through the mists Of years is present to me in its fierce, Unsparing clearness as of yesterday. Each night I dream again the old despair; Each night I lie and feel the chill slow hours Drag onward through the darkness and my hope Grow hourly colder, see the cold grey dawn Come creeping up across the Eastern slopes, The hills flush purple with the unseen sun And the dull heavens flame golden with the day, As when, in the bright mockery of that morn, The shadow of my endless night of woe Darkened the dawnlight. See, my life fades out In the grey shadow of the dying day And all my footsteps tend toward the dusk. Hast thou no pity? Can it be those sweet, Honey-sweet words, wherewith thou fedst my hope, Were no more meaningful than mortal vows? Can it be true, what I have heard folk say, That love of Gods is like the eternal fire, Which burns but him who handles it, itself, Changeless and vivid, freezes in the flame? I cannot think that thou wilt let me sink Into the cold and gloomy deeps of death, Without one token of thine ancient love, One symbol of thy still compassionate care. Let me but gather once more from thy lips The honey of thy kisses, drink again From out thine eyes their philtres of sweet death, Once more renew, though but a moment's space, The unattainted memory of old bliss, And then dead love shall slay me with the sting Of its undying poison. Let me press My withered lips to thine immortal ones And feel the warm white girdle of thine arms Once more about my neck, — but touch thy hand And touching, welcome death! Ah me! I dote. I ask to feel once more that agony Of gradual despair the shrouding years Have softened. Rather let me beg of thee A fitter boon, — that thou wilt lay thy hand Upon my mouth and smoothe the torrid trace Of thy hot passion from my pallid lips With its cool flower-touch. For I yearn to slake My thirst with long draughts of the poppied flood. I weary after death and cannot die. The haunting memory of thy breathless love Holds back my spirit from the slopes of death; Thy hot kiss burns upon my weary lips And will not let me pass. Not all the streams Of Lethe could do out that ardent stain, Whose spell thou only, that didst lay it on, Canst bid release its hold upon my soul. What should I do among the mail-clad ghosts That crowd the courts of the Elysian fields,— Shades that have never known a heavenly love, Whose windy babble is of battled fields,— With that hot seal of immortality Upon my lips? To all eternity I should relive, in those eternal shades, The ghost of that irrevocable past, Whose sorcery thou only canst uncharm. Oh, rather let me brook the pangs of hell And feel Tisiphone's unresting lash, Far rather all the torments of the damned, Whose spirit does not prey upon itself, Than that eternal awful life in death, That endless immortality of pain! I do not yearn, as others might have yearned, To climb with thee those star-crowned steeps of heaven Or win a place in those supernal spheres Wherein thy beauty burns eternally, Among the Gods divinest, as thy star Shines in the meaner circle of its mates; Nor do I thirst to breathe the ambient fire That is the air of those celestial plains. Too well I know, my world-worn soul might not Endure the intolerable ecstasy Of that fierce ichor coursing through my veins: The fragile texture of this cunning clay Would shrink and shrivel into nothingness In the hot flame of an immortal love. I do but ask of thee forgetfulness And the blank calm of unremembering night. Ah me! Methinks I hear the throb of wings And feel the stir of an immortal breath Thrilling the restful air. My prayer is heard: A soft hand sweeps across my burning lips And the fierce agony of ceaseless pain Fades from my spirit. Thanks, sweet goddess, thanks! Thou hast not all forgotten and I go To drink oblivion from the sluggish flood. Thanks, thanks! My soul slips swiftly from the world, Freed from the trammels that did fetter it To life. I smell the lilies of the dead And hear dull Lethe gurgle through her weeds. VOL. II LONDON CITY POEMS. I.A CITY APOLOGUE. I love the grey old City's storied walls. Not all the glare and turmoil of the day, The hum and whirl of commerce in the streets, Can dim for me the light of old romance, That gilds its hoary monuments and towers. I love to see the quiet dignity With which, when work is done and night draws on And all the din of footsteps fades away, It shakes from off its flanks the ebbing tide Of busy life, slips off the glare of day, Wraps round its walls the mantle of the past And settles back to its historic calm, As if no break divided its long rest. And ever, in the golden calm of eve, When the clear sky grows dim toward the dusk, Its streets for me are thick with memories, Stately and sweet and sorrowful. I hear The feet of Sidney echo on the stones And see, in silence, noble Raleigh's face, Pale with long prison, peer from out the bars Upon a shadowy crowd. But not alone My fancy dwells upon the peopled past. I have no taint of that unlovely scorn Which sees no beauty save in things long dead, No sweetness in the world we live amongst. I feel that, in the new as in the old, Great deeds are possible, heroic lives Lived nobly and true deaths died faithfully, And please myself to find out quiet flowers, That have bloomed bravely in the City smoke, And souls whose clear eternal Spring of love Has made their thought immortal. Many such, Unknown to fame, have blossomed, lived and died, Quiet dull lives, whose course the peace of God Has, as the sky on broad, unrippled streams, Filled with reflected heaven. Such a life, Uncelebrate and sweet, my memory holds Within its holiest casket, as one lays A graven gem in velvet. One, whose path Of years I love to follow, all his life Dwelt in the City's dim and sunless shade And there, from early youth to quiet death, Worked hardly at dull toil for daily bread. One of those earnest, tender-hearted men We find sometimes among hard-handed folk, Whose souls' mute poetry, expressionless, Is hidden by the sameness of their lives, To him God's world was one great fairy tale, As sad and sweet as such tales use to be. With heart too large to hold aught else but love, He had but few to love. The delicate And shrinking clearness of his mental sense Held him aloof from those who shared his task And he was lonely in the world of men. His soul was full of sweet and tender doubt. Across the hum and whirl of toil he oft Looked, with mute wistfulness, at that great world Of fame and action which, thus seen afar, Was lovely to him as the rainbow is, That is our symbol of unreal hope; And there were times when he would grieve to think He could not serve God in some nobler way. He felt a barrier lay 'twixt him and it, A wall of crystal, that he might not pass; And so he did but yearn and to his work Turned dumbly. Yet the chrism of his love Rounded his life-work to ideal shape, Unknown to him, and all his heart was full Of such a deep and sweet humanity, His life grew fragrant with the inner soul; And weary folk, who passed him in the streets, Saw Christ's love beam from out the wistful eyes And had new confidence in God and man. And so he worked and longed and lived and loved, Did noble deeds, unknowing what he did, Thought noble thoughts, unconscious of their worth, And lived that greatness he desired in vain. One friend he had, as poor as he, perchance, But rich in hope; one of those wide-souled men Whose natural mission seems the cure of souls, Lark-hearted, with a native trick of song, He looked on all with clear and hopeful eyes And with a thinker's austere tenderness, Tried all things in the crucible of thought. He loved the gentle humble-minded man And had long drawn from him his secret soul As tenderly as Spring draws primrose-blooms From the young earth. And once, when they had talked Awhile together and some chance had turned The converse on the worker's long desire, The other rose and pacing up and down, Said to his friend, “Had you told Hafiz this, The poet who brought down the golden sun And with it made his verses glad and bright, He might have answered somewhat on this wise, Veiling, as was his wont, the barb of thought Under the wreathing blooms of metaphor.” Then he took up his parable and spoke. “A lily grew upon the plains of Fars And drank the living radiance of the sun And fed her fill upon those golden dews That Persian poets call the tears of God. About her lay a paradise of sweets. Narcissus-cups and stately amaranths And many another gorgeous Eastern flower Hid the brown earth with rainbow-coloured blooms: And now and then, when the light morning breeze Inclined the lily's stalk toward the dim Horizon's golden marge, the regal bloom Of roses met her vision and she knew Their scent upon the perfumed winds of heaven, Wherewith the evening cooled the glowing plains. But she herself stood on a little hill, Unmated and alone, a stretch of sand Parting her from the crowd of kindred blooms. Great grief to her this was; it seemed as if Her place had been forgotten in the plan And she alone could have no part in God Nor work for Nature, as her comrades did. The distant hum of some small neighbouring towns, Where afar off dwelt sparsely-scattered men, Came to her, sweetened by the breath of flowers. At times she heard the tinkling camel-bells, Sparkles of sound upon a murmurous sea, And her heart yearned to grow toward the world And take her share of duty with the rest. And with the yearning brighter grew her bloom And richer waxed the fragrance of her breath, Until the air was filled with that sweet scent, The soul and essence of desireful love; And from afar the perfume of the flower Was wafted unto many a toiling man, So that he felt refreshed and comforted And said, “What angel hovers in the air? I smell the almond-blooms of Paradise.” So sweet it was that, over all the rest, An angel, hovering o'er the neighbouring flowers, Caught the unearthly fragrance, which recalled To him the odorous balms of his own heaven; Then, nestling in the lily's cup, he felt The stir of yearning at its fragrant heart And comprehending, with the skill of love, All that lay hidden in its candid soul, ‘Take heart,’ said he, ‘white lily. God is sweet And life that is not sweet has little God. Who thinks a life, unstirred by sounding deeds And void of settled aim save love and peace, Is dutiless, knows little of the links Of purpose that conjoin all natural things. Life is lived less in action than in thought And all its aims are summarised in love. Thou givest all thyself. Can God give more? Would'st thou give more than God, love more than Love? Be comforted; thou hast the praise of God.’ And the white flower was sorrowful no more.” II.AN IDYLL OF THE PLAGUE. (A. D. 1866.) A stretch of river broadening to the sea; Long tracts of marsh and sandy-bottomed shore, Through which the full tide, in the evening light, Glistens, broad-mirrored, and with liberal flow, Laps o'er the marge its lavish liquid gold: Sunset-enlightened sky, clear with the fires Of dying day and in the faint far blue, Gold-glinting spires and rosy-tinted white Of roofs, where sleeps the little seaside town: Upon the eager, seaward running flood, A stately vessel, gay with glistering flags And brilliant with the snow of stainless sails, That blossom out along their pine-stem spires, Rocks in the light breath of the coming wind: And on the shore three figures, in whose eyes The grief of parting dims the golden blink Of sunset and the rosy-purple glow Of clouds that float upon the western haze. A woman, clad as women use to be Who, poor, are yet not needy, to whose lot Some share of ease has fallen, and two girls, Her daughters, one fifteen, the other twelve; All with sad faces turned toward the ship And eyes that strive to hold her back with looks. Awhile the wistful sorrow of their gaze Seems gifted with some strange magnetic force; For still the light breeze puffs and dies away And the loose sails flap idly 'gainst the masts. At last, the faint breaths freshen into wind And the smooth current ripples to its kiss. Some white thing flutters from the deck; the sails Bend slowly to the breezes and the ship Glides, with the tide-flow, past the line of foam, That marks the river's boundary, and so Into the rougher waters of the main. A little while, their eyes, who watch from shore, Strained to the utmost, follow, in her course, The hastening ship, that bears their dearest one Into the western distance; then the glow Fades from the track of the departed sun; The glints of light upon the distant crests Die slowly and the sunned snow of the sails Sinks, with the dying day, into the dusk. Then, back again, with aching hearts, they turned To where, within the smoke-enshrouded heart Of the great town they lived, amidst a maze Of narrow tortuous streets, that wound about The region of the docks and ran along The river ramparted with many a wharf. All day the hum and roar of traffic whirled About the place and even in the night The air was full of noise: across the streets Huge waggons toiled and patient labouring hacks Tugged mighty burdens up the long steep lanes. Three rooms they had, poor, but yet not without Some touch of grace and comfort to conceal Their poverty. The place was bright and warm With gorgeous shells and corals, red and gold, Rose-pink and pearly, that the husband's care And father's thought had brought as memories Of cruises in the wondrous southern seas; And spangled foreign birds, that once had hopped And chirrupped 'mid the palm and banian boughs, In the clear air of golden-stranded isles, Under the blue of rainbow-flowered skies, With their emblazoned plumage, emerald And gold and purple, lighted up the place With an unreal unfamiliar air Of foreign splendour. Very dear to them, For whom long use had sanctified its walls And love had lent its very poverty A beauty of its own, the dwelling was,— To them, who never in their lives, perhaps, Had seen a field of cowslips all in bloom Nor gathered violets in the early spring; For love did hallow for them all mean things And gilded City smoke with hope and peace. Long had they dwelt there, many quiet years, The oft-recurring pangs of waiting fear And doubt as oft forgotten in the bright Alternate joy of meeting and the rare Short sudden sweetness of the dear one's stay, Year after year, with these that were his all. This time a longer voyage had he gone, Into the gold of Polynesian seas; And grave forebodings had made sad the hearts Of wife and children: for their fearful love, True-womanly, saw nought but certain ill In the unknown. They shuddered at the tales Of fierce sea-monsters, that old sailors told, And all their yarns of horror and affright About that false Pacific, whose clear blue Seethes at the heart with unsuspected storms, And pictured to themselves their sailor tossed, Helpless, upon the hungry pitiless waves Or struggling in the jaws of some foul shark, Whilst the clear deep ran crimson with his blood. In vain had he, who had small thought of fear, Save for his dear ones, striven to divert Their fears to quiet hope's expectancy, With tales of all the wonders and delights, That lay within that coral-hearted main, And all the golden-fronded palms, that spread Their waving fans toward the roseate heaven, And promises of strange and lovely things, The magic spoils of Nature's fairyland, From that rich treasury of emerald isles, He meant to bring with him on his return. 'Twas all in vain, he could not ease their hearts Of that deep-seated longing, which foretold Some vague calamity, as summer air Is big with thunder, though the sky seem clear. And so, a little while, when he was gone, They went about their work all listlessly; But soon the ancient wont came to their aid And they fell back into the olden groove Of quiet expectation and resigned. They did not let confessed inquietude Disturb the eventless current of their lives, Spent in hard work, with little time for doubt: But yet the seedlets of that brooding fear, Whose vague unrest they even to themselves Acknowledged not, lay latent in their hearts, Ready to burst into a deadly flower, When hap should will it. Onward went the days And now the time began to draw toward The ending of their fears. Two years, not more, (Had he assured them) would have filled their span, Before the “Kelpie” should again ascend The river and cast anchor in the docks And he again should press them to his heart. The expected day passed by, and then a week, A month and many weary, weary months; And still they had no tidings of the ship. As yet they had no thought of wreck or death; The thought was far too awful to be thought, —God could not be so cruel,—till, at last, Well nigh a year beyond the rightful time, When he, according to his word, again Should have set foot within their ready doors, They read a brief note in some journal's coign, Which said, the ship, now twelve months overdue, Had not for long been heard of (Oh, how cold And bloodless seemed the formal printed words, That were so fateful to them!) and 'twas feared She had, with all her crew, gone down at sea; And this seemed the more probable (it said) That some, who held like course, had, far from land, Picked up a board from off a vessel's stern, That bore, in half-obliterated words, The name of “Kelpie”. Yet 'twas possible She had been stranded on some distant isle Of many, that were known to stud those seas, Innumerous, and many of the crew, If not the whole, might still be living there, Mayhap detained by savages or else Devoid of means to leave the island shore, Their boats all shattered by the self-same storm That might have wrecked the ship. A straw of hope, To which they clung, as only women cling, When those they love are hoped for. So they lived, Still thinking he could not be lost to them And looking ever for his near return. The months went by and still no tidings came And still they watched and longed for him and hoped A hopeless hope, more anguishful than fear. Meantime, the money he had left with them, To fend them from privation and avert The grim necessity of ceaseless toil For scanty bread, though hoarded with close care, Was all expended and the stern, hard times Exacted labour far beyond their wont. One after one the little luxuries And fanciful adornments, that the lost Had gathered with such loving care for them, Were bartered for bare food, and naked walls Joined with wan looks to make the place look drear, That erst had worn so homely bright an air. Stern want began to pinch their toiling souls And harder and yet harder grew the times, Until unceasing labour scarce could earn Sufficient food to hold the weary souls Within the spare starved bodies. Hollow-eyed And gaunt, mere spectres of their former selves, They could have been contented, whilst the hope, That had so long sustained them, stayed with them. But now four years had passed and every chance Seemed gone for them; and slowly hope died out And one great gloom of unillumined pain Shrouded the bitter struggle of their lives. One night, as, cowered o'er the scanty fire, With weary eyes bent on the pitiless work, They toiled, with hearts from which hard use had chased All feeling save a horrible dull pain And (God be thanked) all-blest undying love, The youngest girl let fall her half-done work And laying down her yet all-childish head Upon her mother's bosom, faintly said, “Mother, forgive me; I can work no more; My heart is sick with pain.” And so was dead. Thus had death blotted from their book of life Its Alpha and Omega, first and last, Father and youngest child, and there were left But two poor women, sorrow-struck and wan, All lonely with each other in the world. Left by themselves to breast the pitiless world, Nearer and nearer drew their faithful hearts And brighter burned their mutual love (half pain), As harder grew the misery and the toil. And now the June of the fifth year was come And vague forebodings hovered in the air Of coming horrors. From the distant East, Each mail bore tidings how the Indian shores Lay prostrate in the grasp of that fell plague, That had some dozen years before laid waste All Europe with the hell-wind of its breath: And as the summer waned, the time grew fierce With heat scarce known in England and the pest Flew nearer through the neighbouring continents. Foul mists began to hover o'er the town, Significant of coming pestilence, And weird miasmas in the dead of night Rose from the river's rank and sweltering flood And wrapped the sleepers in their fell embrace. And gradually folk heard of awful deaths, Unknown to ordinary summer-time; And men said “Cholera”, with bated breath, And laid their hands upon each other's lips, As if they feared the pest would hear its name And come as if invoked to come. At length, September came, and with it came the plague. Into fell life the hidden germs of death Leapt with an awful swiftness and the air Was deadly with the poison of their breath. Folk died like sheep and every workhouse hole Was crammed to overflowing with the dead. The sextons could not do their dismal work Swiftly enough: the dead outstripped the live And arms that plied the spade grew numb with toil. Day after day up rose the pitiless sun And rained down flame on the deserted streets: Strong men dropped smitten in the open ways And funerals choked the city's avenues. All round them died, in hundreds, of the plague, The gaunt, half-starved poor folk; women and men And children fell to death the easier prey, That they could scarce be said to live; and soon The wave of pestilence swept over them. One evening, from her work the mother came Back to the one poor room still left to them, Where sat the daughter and her scanty meal Awaited her return, and staggering in, Fell down upon the bed, with trembling hands And nerveless limbs. Her eyes were wild and glazed And all her aspect to her child too well Revealed the fatal symptons of the plague. But, when her daughter strove to raise her up And tend her with the fearlessness of love, She started up with a despairing strength And with death written in her flaming eyes, Conjured the girl to “let her die alone And save herself. She must not touch her now; She had the pest;” and strove to fend her off From nearing her. But she (so strong is love) Said, “Mother, you are all I have on earth: For me life is not glad, and without you, 'Twere worthless. Please God, if He bid you die, I will die with you. Nay, you could not have The heart to die without me and to leave Me quite deserted in this dreary world! We have too long been one in misery And love, for God to part our love in death.” So saying, round her mother's thin worn neck Her arms she threw and drew her burning head To its old refuge on her faithful breast. The morning came and found them still so clasped, Sleeping the fitful sleep of feveredness. All day they lay, in helpless agony, Unnoticed and alone; for they who lived Around them had no aid to waste on them, Being well nigh as stricken as themselves; And darkness came and found them sick to death. The weary hours went by and still they lay In death-like silence, till the gloom of night Began to blend into the gray of morn; And then the daughter turned and feebly cried, With failing voice, “Mother!” And she who, dumb With agony, grew stiff in the death-trance, (O mighty effort of immortal love!) Lifted her arms, already stark with death, And strained her daughter closer to her heart. A little while they lay and then again The daughter spoke; “Mother, are you asleep? I feel so weary, yet not now in pain: I think this must be death; I seem to see Father at last again. Kiss me once more, For the last time;” and feebly strove to press Her pallid lips to those belovéd ones, Where all her love was centred, and to rouse The torpid senses to some feeble spark Of animation. But the mother lay Moveless and stiff in death and she herself Already felt the angel of the plague Draw with chill finger-tips the film of death Over her eyes. The dawn came creeping up The eastern sky and gradually the hand Of friendly death relaxed the pain-strung mouth Into a smile of peace; the lids dropped down And the wan features settled into rest. Suddenly footsteps sounded on the stair; The door flew open and a sun-bronzed man, Haggard and toil-worn, burst into the room, With mingled hope and fear inscribed upon His eager face. The naked walls first caught His gaze: where erst he had been wont to see Comfort and plenty, all too plainly showed Despair and want. And then his haggard eyes Fell on the two dead women on the bed, That lay, yet warm, clasped in each other's arms, Unseparate in death as in their lives; And with an awful cry of agony, He fell upon his knees and hid his face Against the coverlet. A moment passed, Dumb with undying pain; and then a sob, Big with the dead hope of five weary years, Broke up out of his breast, too fiercely strained With agony to yield its woe in tears; And with that one sob burst in twain his heart. The dawn crept on; and when the neighbours came, Hearing no stir, as there was wont to be For early morning toil, to know the cause (Too well suspecting, in that awful time, What was the cause) of the unwonted calm, They found him dead by his belovéd dead, Whilst blue broke day across the Eastern hills And the glad sun rained gold upon the earth. III.QUIA MULTUM AMAVIT. At an inquest held at the Whitehorse Tavern, before Mr. Cooper, Coroner for the Western district, on the body of Eliza Farrell, unfortunate female, found drowned below Waterloo Bridge on Monday last, Rosse Farrell said, “Deceased was my sister. She was an unfortunate. She was unmarried. She had worked as a seamstress till trade was so bad last year that she could not earn a living at the prices paid by the sweaters and she then went upon the streets.” Witness believed she would never have done so but for her two illegitimate children, of whom she was passionately fond. Witness had no doubt that deceased's mind had been affected by their death. They died of neglect and starvation, owing to a woman, whom deceased paid to take care of them, having spent the money in drink. She paid the woman every penny she could scrape together and witness had known her sell the dress off her back to make up the weekly money. Deceased came to her on Saturday night, after having been to see the children, and told her she had found they were dead and had been already buried by the parish. She seemed quite distracted and rushed out of the house like a mad thing and witness had never seen her again. The photograph produced (found on deceased) was that of the children. After a few remarks from the coroner, the jury returned a verdict of “Suicide in a state of temporary insanity.” —Extract from daily paper.) JUST a drowned woman, with death-draggled hair And wan eyes, all a-stare; The weary limbs composed in ghastly rest, The hands together prest, Tight holding something that the flood has spared Nor even the rough workhouse folk have dared To separate from her wholly, but untied Gently the knotted hands and laid it by her side. A piteous sight,—yet not without some sign Of handiwork divine; Some faint, mysterious traces of content About the brows, unbent At last from toil and misery,— some mark Of child-like, tired composure in the stark, Wan features, on whose calm there is imprest At last the seal of rest. See, she was fair,—and now she's rid of strife, She's comelier than in life; For death has smoothed the tresses of her hair And stroked the lines of care, With no ungentle hand, from off her brow. She seems at peace at last,—no matter how. Death has been angel-sweet to her tired soul; She has no need of dole. You know her story? Just the sad, old tale, Whose victims never fail! Common enough and mean, but yet not quite Without its gleam of light; Not all devoid of some redeeming spark Of nobleness to lighten its grim dark. You turn away. You've heard of many such? “She was so wicked!” But she loved so much. I tell you, this poor woman you despise, From whom you turn your eyes, Loved with an ardour, side by side with which Our lives, so seeming rich In virtues and in grandeurs, fade away Into the dusk, as night before the day. Yet of her life you fear to hear me tell. “She was so wicked!” But she loved so well. You saw the portrait taken from her grasp, Stiffened in Death's cold clasp? Two little children, poorly clad and plain, Sun-scorched and worn with pain, Wan with mean cares, too early for their years, Their child-eyes eager with unchildish fears And sordid, bitter yearnings. “But a smutch!” You say. “And after all it's nought to me What was her life and what her hopes might be. She was so wicked!” Oh, she loved so much! True, a mere daub, whereon the beneficent sun Has written, in faint, dun, Unbeauteous lines, a hard and narrow life, Wherein dull care was rife And little thought of beauty or delight Relieved the level blackness of the night: And yet I would not change those pictured two For all the cherubs Raphael ever drew. Two little faces, plain enough to you, Nothing of bright or new; Such faces as one meets amongst each crowd, Sharp-visaged and low-browed; And yet to her, her picture-books of heaven, The treasuries from which the scanty leaven, Wherewith she stirred her poor mean life to joy, Was drawn,—pure gold for her without alloy. They were her all, and by no sacred tie, No pure maternity. To her the name of wife had been denied; In sin she lived and died. She was an outlaw from the pale of right And yet there was that in her had such might, That she would not have shamed our dear Lord Christ. She loved and that sufficed. They were her shame and pride, her hope and fear, To her how dreadly dear We scarce can feel. You happy, virtuous wives, Whose quiet, peaceful lives Flow on, unstirred by misery or crime, Can have no thought how high these souls can climb For love; with what a weird, unearthly flame These wretched mothers love their babes of shame; How they can suffer for them, dull and mean As they may seem, and sell their souls to screen Their darlings, dealing out their hearts' best blood, Drop after drop, to buy them daily food. And so for years she toiled for them, as none Could ever toil, save one Who had nought else to care for, night and day, Until her hair grew gray With labour such as souls in Dante's hell Might have been bound to, and with fiends as fell To act as her taskmasters and compel The poor, thin fingers;—yet was honest still For many a weary day and night, until She found, with aching heart and pain-crazed head, Her toil could not suffice to earn her children bread. They were her all; and she, ground down by want, With hollow eyes and gaunt, Saw but their misery, small beside her own, Heard but their hungry moan, Could not endure their piteous looks and sold Herself to infamy, to warm their cold, To feed their hunger and assuage their thirst, Not hers. And yet, folk say, she is accurst! Cruel as fate was, there was yet in store More pain for her and more Fierce anguish. Famine and the plague combined, In league with her own kind, To steal from her her one source of content, The one faint gleam of higher things, that blent Its glimmer with her life's unbroken grey; The one pale star, that turned her night to day, Sank in the chill of death's delivering wave, Extinguished in the grave. Not even the omnipotence of Love Had power to rise above The sullen stern unpitying sweep of Fate, That left her desolate. O wretched mother! Wretched time of ours! When all enlightenment's much-vaunted powers To save this Magdalen's all could only fail, When Love has no avail! Starved even to death! For this she'd sold her soul; This was her striving's goal! Life had no longer aught that might suffice To hallow all its dreary want and vice. Nothing but death remained to her, the crown Of all whose lives are hopeless. So fell down Her star of life into the dusk of night And she gave up the fight. So calm and peaceful seemed the dark grey flood, Foul with much human blood. God help her! Death was kinder than the world. The sullen waters whirled A moment o'er a circling plash, and then She was forgotten from the world of men And it was nought to her what folk might say. Quiet at last she lay. I know not if this poor soul's martyrdom For you be wholly dumb. To me, I own, her sin seems holier far Than half our virtues are; For hers was of that ore which, purged of dross, Yields gold that might have gilded Christ's own cross And He have smiled. And yet you fear her touch? “She was so wicked!” But she loved so much. And of her common, mean and awful fate Our righteous ones will prate,— A fruitful text for homily!—until Another come to fill Her vacant place. And yet none sees the bloom Of love, that opened in her life's blank gloom And made it angel-bright. Folk turn aside And know not how a martyr lived and died. “Accurséd,” say they, “is the suicide. In sin she lived and died. We have in her, and she in us, no part. Our lives, thank heaven! dispart. At least we're holier than she.” Alas! My brethren, when reflected in God's glass, I doubt me much if many of our lives Will, when the day of reckoning arrives, Or all our virtues, with her sin compare Or as her life be fair. Even grim Death was pitiful to her; Her rest he did not stir. Shall we be, who with her drew common breath, Less pitiful than Death? We, who have heard how Christ once lived and died, With whom His love is fabled to abide, Shall we avoid a poor dead sinner's touch? So wicked, say we? Oh, she loved so much! For me, I cannot hold her life's long pain To have been all in vain. I cannot think that God will let her go, After this life of woe; Cannot believe that He, whose deathless love She aped so well, will look on from above With careless righteousness, while she sinks down Into hell's depths, and with a pious frown, Leave her to struggle in the devil's clutch. True, she was wicked;—but she loved so much. IV.A CHRISTMAS VIGIL. “LET me but see the light of heaven again!” And with chill fingers, from the window pane I drew the curtain. All the glass was starred With quaint frost-tracery, intercrossed and barred With the cold mimic blossoms of the time, The death in life of flowerage of the rime. The day grew dark toward the Christmas Eve: Without, each hanging gable-edge and eave Was looped and curtained with the trellised snow And all the sky was drear for winter woe. The streets were still for weariness and all The fields lay dead beneath a death-white pall; Whilst o'er the fretted silver such as went About the ways, in that drear wonderment, Broke not the deathly silence with their tread. It seemed a city of the risen dead, Awsome with living ghosts, that stalked along The pallid highways in a ghastly throng, Flitting as noiselessly as shades. Within, My grief seemed with the grief of Nature twin: There was a drearier winter at my heart Than bound the fields and meadows. There, no part Of that bright ecstasy—wherewith the voice Of angels bade the shrouded earth rejoice For that upon the keen-aired Christmas morn There was in Bethlehem of Juda born One who should bring to bloom the bud of peace And be Himself the blossom,—brought decrease Of sadness; nor,—O sweet Lord Christ! Alas! Has not thy memory withered like dry grass, When summer-winds are pitiless!—the chime (A hollow mockery of the loveless time) Of bells, whose song was tuneless with the sense Of its unmeaning, cheered the sad suspense That weighed upon me. Long past every fear, Because past hope for ever, one all-dear, All precious to me, lay at odds with Death And I already felt the icy breath Of the dread angel stir the frost-stilled air, As I did watch. The battle and the care Were over and the dim cold hour was come, When my sad heart, like the sad streets, was dumb With its dead hopes, unknowing if the gloom Were big with ecstasy or if some doom Of unexperienced horror lay concealed Within its awful bosom, where ensealed Slept the mysterious Future. Very dear To my most God-like sympathies, no mere Convenient friend, with whom the only tie Is mutual ease and use of amity, Was he who lay a-dying. He had been My comrade, when the hopes of Spring were green, My help in autumn's dreary blank of gray, In winter's night of doubt my cheer and stay. Together we had trod the path of years, Hoped hopes together, feared each other's fears, Seen morning lighten in each other's eyes And soul to soul had striven for the prize Of perfect vision, that should help us read In Nature's tangles the eternal creed. We had so long been habited to share Each other's pain and pleasure, joy and care, To live and breathe each other's life and breath, To think I could not share with him his death Seemed cruel wonder; and to me, his soul Felt the least portion of the common dole, For that but death in life was left to me, Condemned thenceforth in life alone to be, Whilst to his lot fell life in death. And so I sat and watched him, as the fire burnt low, And wondered, in my numbing trance of pain, How long before the morn should come again And puzzled over trifles, whilst there lay Within my heart one gloom of winter's gray And paralysed all thought. My mind went back Along the dim years' memory-misted track And lost itself in woodbine-tangled lanes And saw the silken poppies' crimson stains Sprinkle the russet moorland. Or I stood Within a maze of hawthorn-blossomed wood And knew the bedded violets by their scent And primroses, wide-eyed for wonderment, That glittered in the tender tree-foot green, Under the golden shadow of the treen. And he, who lay a-dying, held once more My hand and walked with me that flowered floor, Filled the sweet air with wise and lovely words Or songs as Spring-like as the pipe of birds; Reasoned of fair and wondrous things and turned All thoughts to beauty, as within him burned The Spring's full glory; took the things of Earth And made them bright with an immortal mirth. So sat I, dreaming o'er dead youth again, Half-conscious, half-forgetful of my pain, Whilst, out of doors, the dream-mist of the snow Fell through the Christmas twilight soft and low. And as the evening darkened into night, Toning to grey the snow's relentless white, I heard his voice, that called me to his side, So faint, another would have thought he sighed. I leant me o'er the bed and took his hand, Seeing by his face how very fast life's sand Ran from the hour-glass. And he, as it were, Renewing life awhile, to hold me there, Raised himself up and lay upon my breast, Silent awhile, whilst day died in the west; And then, “The gates of death do gape for me,” He said. “My feet from life are slipping free. Dear friend, I linger but a second, then Launch out upon the sea unplumbed of men. I go into the darkness; yet you stay And I go lonely on my lightless way. I look into the mystery. Is it rest, Long-yearned-for rest, tow'rd which the chill swift tide Of ebbing life so ceaselessly doth glide? O God, to whom I come, a bidden guest, Let it be peace, I pray! No heaven of psalms, No charm of bended heads and folded palms! My life too long has been a psalm of woes; I crave that Rest to which all Being flows. O Buddha, sweet thy faith was aye to me, That holds us loosed from life in death to be, Absolved and safe from love and pain and dole, Lost in the calm sea of the one great Soul. O God, how fair this lovely Eastern dream, Haply the truth, to my tired soul doth seem,— To lose one's weary personality In the unconsciousness of Deity! I cannot think but Jesus meant the same, Despite the sophisms that debase his name And turn his sweet humanity to gall With priests' and monks' inventions, as with all Great souls and pure, who read the signs of God And leave their dreams to coarser minds, that plod Over their bright imaginings and tread Into the dust each flower that shows its head. Dear Christ! How men have blackened thy white faith And blurred thy heaven with the shadow of death! I enter on the path thy tender feet Trod once,—not bitter to me nor yet sweet; For I am weary and desire to rest, And I am sorely with vague doubt opprest, Lest other toils await me. Yet I hope And fear not, though my feet in darkness grope; For, whilst I hold thy hand, dear friend, I know Christ's love can still in human bosoms glow And love will round all troubles into peace, Although the springs of light and being cease To cheer us. I may say, with Rabelais, As farewell word to living, ‘Je m'en vais Querir le grand Peut-être.’ It is the end. I carry into night thy love, O friend, 'Spite death, 'spite doubt and cold.” And spake no more. And I, down looking if his soul still wore That web of flesh it long had found so sore, Saw that the appointed peace had made him dumb And knew that the deliverer Death was come. V.A DREAM OF FAITHS. WITHIN a maze of narrow, tortuous streets, Whose convolutions deaden the day's din And roar of City turmoil to that hum Of softly murmuring sound one hears within The pearly chambers of a twisted shell, A gray old church stands in a little space Of swarded churchyard, green and variegate With plaited flower beds; in the City's heart, A flowered nest of peace and restfulness. But one of many other quiet nooks That nestle in the mirky City's midst, To me long use and knowledge made it dear Beyond its fellows, for it seemed to me, The ancient fane, all lonely as it was And resonant to but few human steps, Wore an especial air of friendly peace And seemed to tender comfort to my soul. Ay, and the very flowers had in their eyes, Upturned to seek the friendly heaven's blink Between the long lines of encroaching walls, A deeper meaning than flowers use to show To general sight, as who should say, “We long After the open freedom of the plains And breezy freshness of the blossomed fields With an incessant longing; yet, resigned To do God's service where He bids it us, We are content to live beneath the smoke And give our scent and comfort of our bloom As freely as our brethren of the meads, Feeding our yearning on the infrequent sun And the rare love of some few weary souls, That gather consolation from our life.” Hard by the church, a little parsonage, Gray as itself, but green with clustering wealth Of ivy tendrils, nestled to its side, As if for shelter from the encroaching world: And therein dwelt an old and reverend man, Who was the priest of that neglected fane, Uncomraded, except by memories And the vague creatures of his own sweet thoughts. A man who, working God's work in the world, Had little commerce with world's use, but dwelt Within the heaven of his own clear faith, 'Spite age's frosts, he was a child at heart And had still childhood's generous confidence, Its pure delight in bright and innocent things. For him, the dreams, that had made sweet his youth And glorified his manhood, still relieved The sunset-shadow of his waning life And lighted up the gloom of those stern hours, When, in the gray of the descending years, The sea of memory gives up its dead. He had not lost his early purity Of joy in all the sweet and rare delights, The delicate and shrinking mysteries, That swarm, for those who love, in this our world: He had yet faith in all the lovely myths And fables, that do symblize God's love In picture-speech of bird-song and of bloom; Relived dead youth in every violet's scent, Saw Ophir in each lily's golden dust, Golconda in each flower-cup's crystal dew. The sceptic murmur of the unquiet age, Eager for light, no matter though it lose, In the cold gleam, some glow of ancient warmth, Had reached him in his peaceful solitude; And to his mild but clear intelligence It could not but be patent that the doom Of death was passed for many a thing he loved, Much good, that had for many weary years Outlived its use, and many an old belief, That, in its time, had been the breath of life To millions, but was now long since worn out And sunk to superstition. Much he grieved A natural grief (as one who, in a dream, Sees the phantasmata of his sweet thoughts Fade from him and will not be comforted, But mourns them waking, though he knew them not For real or seeming) and his soul was full Of troubling doubt. For him the coming years Were big with fears; he could not shape his hope, That had so long run all unquestioningly In the worn channel of the ancient faith, Into the stronger current of new thought, That swept old landmarks from his way of life. The clinging dogmas of time-honoured creeds Fettered his spirit with the knitted webs Of their exanimate subtleties, so that He was not free to let his simple love (That else might, with the magic of its own All-powerful menstruum, have solved for him The weary problem) work its natural work, Clogged as it was by age-old fallacies. And so his spirit in the tangling doubts Strove, like a fly caught in a spider's web, That twines itself more inextricably, With every effort, in the unyielding toils. One night, he dreamt, an angel came to him, As Beatrice to Dante, in the shape, Thrice sublimate, of one whom he had loved In the clear Spring-time of his vanished youth, And took him by the hand and led him up To a high mountain's snow-incoronate top And showed him all the kingdoms of the world. Before him lay the glory and the power Of all that has on earth been fair and bright, Stately and wonderful, since being was; All teachings that have swayed the souls of men, All that has aye been powerful to save, All faiths, were imaged for him in the dream, Living a symbol-life in definite shapes; And all high thoughts and solemn mysteries Moved, radiant, o'er the surface of the world, Clothed in their own fulfilment's acted shape, Or stood in statue-majesty, enshrined In snow of marble and gold-glitterance. Beneath his feet the earth spread far and wide, Veined with the tortuous silver of its streams, And here and there majestic temples rose, Graven to all cunning shapes of human art And vivid at the heart with fire-cored gems. Strange lustres flashed from the enchanted shapes And met each other in the throbbing air, Weaving a dazzling, iridescent haze About the path of those weird phantasies. The netted radiance hid the constant sky And made, for those that dwelt beneath its spell, A new and seeming heaven, bright and strange, Here sweet with glancing lights, there stern with storms, And holding, on its topmost pinnacle, A painted dream of earthly luxury, That men had wrought from their fantastic hopes And set it in the sky and called it “heaven.” The priest gazed long upon the changing play Of those phantasmal semblances, and soon He saw the gradual light fade out from them; The gem-fire died within its ancient haunts And all the radiant shapes grew etiolate And colourless as darkness-blanching flowers. It seemed to him, the essence of their life Had left them and their source of radiance, Impermanent, had dried up at the spring. And as he looked, a crash of thunderous song, Wherein all awful sweetness was expressed, Pealed out across the surface of the earth And rent the charmed veil of that seeming heaven, Letting in on it the eternal light. The dream-forms shrank and shrivelled in the blaze Of new irradiance, “alba sicut lux,” And all the structures of that wondrous birth Sank into ruin. All the earth was strewn With one huge waste of gray and lifeless wrecks. He looked and knew the symbolled destiny, Pre-eminent among the other shapes, Of that old faith, which was so dear to him; And with a sudden dreary consciousness And sense how blank was life thenceforth to him, Shorn of its own particular star of hope, Sank down upon his knees and bowed his head Upon his hands. The angel looked at him With eyes in which there shone compassionate love And peace; and then to him, “Be not dismayed: These are but earthly things thou seëst die, But fabrics of a human phantasy, That men have fashioned, after their own shape, From their unreasoning fears and baseless hopes, From their unreal pains and feverish joys, And knelt and worshipped their own handiwork. And so they are but mortal, do but live So long as the quick, animating soul Throbs in their confines. When it flees from them, They crumble into vague and shapeless wreck. The hearts of men do ofttimes cleave to them, For that they feel in them their godlike part, The sympathetic presence of the soul, And worship, all unconscious, their own selves. Many have drawn from them the breath of life, Whilst that their living virtue yet had force; And folk still cling to them with desperate faith, Long after every spark of life has fled, As one who seeks deliverance in the arms Of his once powerful friend, now old and weak, And will not lightly credit his decay. But, ere they had their being, God was God And will be yet, although the heavens pass. Be not dismayed: there is no change in Him Alone. Thy refuge is the Eternal God And under thee the everlasting arms.” The listener's heart drank comfort from the clear Sustaining words, and from the shade of doubt His soul leapt out into the day of hope, As waters leap from out the dim rock-rifts Into the morning splendour of the sun. Before him still the waste of ruins lay, But over all things, as within himself, He felt some healing influence had passed And softened their stern aspect of despair. The garish sun died out and all the earth Lay in the moonlit sanctity of death: And as he stood, the air was all astir With that blithe mystery, that ushers in The Spring-time, and the summer-hearted world Throbbed with the coming rapture of the May. The buds burst out into a new flower-birth And all the eager host of passionate blooms Spread, rustling, o'er the surface of the earth. Spring's fresh leaf-green and delicate-petalled blooms Hid the gray ruins with a fragrant shroud; All-mother Earth put forth her flowerful hand And took the dead again to her embrace, All things forgiven, all but love forgotten In the new peace of that assoiling death. The air was sweet with carol; all the woods Were budded and the sudden flowering sky Flamed with the tender promise of new dawn. Then, “Lift thine eyes,” the angel said to him, “Toward the golden region of the East.” He raised his head and looked across the mists To where the sun ran, reddening, through the brume, And burning through the opal-hearted veil, He saw the jasper hills of a new heaven. VI.A PORTRAIT. I knew a poet once, a lonely man, Whose soul dwelt in the dim wood-glooms of thought And dreamt strange visions of enchanted Spring: Whose song, in that bright bloom-tide when the May Quickens life's pulses and the summer lies, Sun-weary, on the painted meadow-grass, Was solemn, strange and sorrowful: scant trace Was there of Spring-tide glory or the craze Of ecstasy, that turns the air to wine, When in the rose-hearts burns the July splendour. What little joy there was was weird and still, Stately and serious, with an undersong That sounded like the night-bird's wailing notes Or the quaint ripple of some low-voiced rill, That murmurs of earth's hidden soul of pain Under her robe of blooms; one heard in it The chariot-thunder of the shrouded hours, That swept across the autumn-verging skies. But, in the winter, when the sky was clear With silver frost and crystal-feathered snow Fell softly through the air, when streamlets lay Fast-locked in dreamless sleep, his soul bloomed out To a new flow'rage and his song grew bright With exquisite strange splendour. In the lines, The ringing sweetness of bird-haunted woods Replaced the crash of snow-enladen boughs: The blooms ran wreathing o'er the broidered page: One smelt the summer in his scented verse And one eternal rose of cloudless sky Glittered, from opal dawn to golden eve, In the clear setting of his pictured words. For why? He saw the complements of things And knew how Nature's ever-changing pulse Throbbed with strange secrets, how the flower of death Bore at its heart the ovary of life. He felt that winter held the germs of Spring And summer's roses slept beneath the snow. And so no joy was sorrowless to him, No sorrow joyless, and his spheral life Lay in the equipoise of perfect peace. In the great city's crowded heart he dwelt And all his life had passed there. Little he Knew of the Spring-sweet glories of the May Or of the rare deep magic of the time When summer brims the jewel-chaliced flowers With wine of wonder and the woods burst out A-bloom with singing. Yet the flowers of May Bloomed in the shaded woodlands of his soul And in his heart a chastened glow of Spring Lived ever. Life for him was sweet and calm, The sweeter for a touch of pain in it, As music saddens to its sweetest key; And so he lived a kind of moonlight life, Where all things remedied their opposites And joy and pain were ever softened down To the calm light of that Eternal Pearl That Dante tells of in his “Paradise.” VII.A DREAM-LIFE. A man lived once within the busy town And filled his days with labour hard and sore: From break of morn, until the night fell down, He worked for bread amid the city's roar. His toil was with no love or friendship blest, His path of life was blank and cold and sere; The one faint hope that lingered in his breast Served but to make his present lot more drear. He had once loved and (dead to all but him) Love's memory yet lingered in his heart; Although his soul was sere and eyes grown dim, That guest from him might nevermore depart. A lonely man, throughout the weary day His hands ceased not from dull and cheerless strife; The outer world for him had long grown gray And little beauty blossomed in his life. But in his heart there was a quiet nook, Where lay old memories, adust and dim; He read on Sundays in the Hebrew book, And dreams of his dead youth came back to him. He read of king and warrior and priest, Heard in his ears the battle's thunderous din, And from his heart the pain of toiling ceased And all his soul had peace from care and sin. He read; and Spring flowered round his weary life; He smelt the sweet faint primroses again And saw white wind-flowers in the woodglooms rife, Heard on the grass the apple-blossoms rain: He saw the azure canopy of heaven, With white-winged clouds that glittered in the sun; He saw the wood-deeps by the sunbeams riven And gold lights flower through the shadows dun. He read; and he was ankle-deep in grass, With cowslip-umbels nodding at his feet, And saw the shadows of the sun-clouds pass, Where with the brook the heavens seemed to meet. He heard the songful babble of the stream, That from its pebbles drew sweet undertones, And watched the minnows, in the golden gleam, Dart in and out the brown and dappled stones. He read; and fragrance of the scented pines Rose round his spirit, like a mist of balm; He saw red fruitage on the strawberry-bines Glow in the hedges in the summer calm. Nesh eyebright looked at him and meadow-sweet; He smelt the scent of the crushed grass again And wild-thyme sent up perfume from his feet, The plant that yields us fragrance from its pain. Once more he passed through woods by autumn worn And trod brown carpets of the rustling leaves; He saw the gold sun glitter on the corn And heard the sickle shear the russet sheaves. He heard sweet voices through the mists of years And quaint wild snatches of forgotten rhyme; And many a love he had embalmed in tears Re-lived for him its early blossom-time. The week-day toil was but a dreary dream, In which the voices of the birds were hushed; It was the things of life that did but seem; The true things on his Sabbath vision rushed. A dream of summer held his weary soul, Although his life seemed echoless and dumb, His spirit from the webs of working stole, And when he died, he thought the Spring was come. VIII.THE RED ROSE. ONE day, as from my bed I went, I saw one stand before the door, Whose hands a bough of blossom bore, Snow-white and very sweet of scent. His visage was full grave and sweet And awful as the morning red, When in the east the night is dead; And lilies grew about his feet. His hair was of a tender gold, As cowslips in the middle Spring, And clad his shoulders, ring on ring; It was full pleasant to behold. White roses in his arms he held And snow-white roses round his head; But on his breast one rose was red, As if his heart's blood there had welled; And in one hand a lily-bell, That garments of fair silver wore And burnt red-golden at the core, As 'twere the sun therein did dwell. “Sir,” said I, “if I may be told, What is the meaning of these flowers, Whose like ne'er drank the Spring's soft showers Nor ever grew on hill or wold?” “These are the roses of the city Of God and eke of Christ,” he said, “That erst in crimson were arrayed, But now are turned all white for pity “Of human dolour and compassion For blindness of mortality; But in this other that ye see The hue, in token of Christ's passion, “Abides, that men may, in its sight, The blood shed for them have in mind And in its bloom fair hope may find And in its smell may have delight. “For this red rose I bear is Love, That sweetens life and softens pain, And thereto should all things be fain And set its sweets all sweets above.” “Sir,” said I, “if I may be told, What is that lily that is dight With leaves of such a lovely white And at the heart is burning gold?” And he, “This is the sign of death, That is without both white and cold, But at the core is burning gold And holdeth store of fragrant breath. “Choose which of these thou willest take, For the dear God, in heaven that lives, Such grace unto all mortals gives, For Christ His Son's belovéd sake, “That each may once within his life Make choice of roses red or white Or lily with the heart of light, To solace him in pain and strife.” And I, “Sir, sorrow is enough Within this life and world of ours And death comes with the evening hours; And so I choose the rose of Love.” Whereat my hand I stretchéd out, That lovely crimson bloom to bear From him and in my bosom wear; But lo! my hand drew back in doubt Which it should take; for that one rose, That in the wreath of white was red, Had loren all its lustihead And had put on the hue of those Which were upon the bough y-sprent; And these, in stead, to crimson turned, As 'twere new fire within them burned; Nay, to the lily there was lent A flush of colour; so I knew Not which was lily nor which rose, Which was the blossom that I chose, So like a bloom on each one blew. Then to the bearer, “Sir,” said I, “Who art thou that, as no man may, Dost make these colours change and play, So that their semblants mock the eye?” And he, “I draw no mortal breath: The Lord, in heaven that reigns above, Did give to me the name of ‘Love’; But oftentimes men call me ‘Death’.” And as he spoke, his seeming fled And melted into empty air, And I into this world of care Went with knit brows and drooping head. And as among the folk I walked, Along wide place and sunny street, Meseemed mine eyes bytimes did meet His form with whom I late had talked, As in the ways he went and strewed White flowers and red with viewless hands; And often in my dreams he stands Before me, as that morn he stood. IX.CHRISTMAS BELLS. O silver-chiming bells, in the misty Christmas morning, Filling with glad ripples the frost-enlightened air, What song is it you sing to us, What tidings that you bring to us, What burden that the clamours of your changeful cadence bear? Do ye still recall the advent of the star-enkindled dawning, When 'mid flower-calm the lily of old Christendom was born? Still hail the domination, In many a land and nation, Of Him who opened baby eyes upon that thronéd morn? Alas! sad bells, this many a day, your tune has lost its meaning; The earth to your bright jubilance is echoless for woe: A strange, prophetic sadness Lies heart-deep in your gladness; Ye can never stir the world again into the olden glow. Ye should rather mourn for hope and faith, that in Christ's grave lie buried, Never again, it seems to us, to see the daybreak beam. The tender, sweet old story Has lost its morning glory; The trace of Christ has faded and His Gospel is a dream. Or is it for the year that's past your brazen throats are clanging, To celebrate its harvesting of righteousness and peace? And is your carol's burden The happy golden guerdon, That love and faith have garnered up to swell the years' increase? Are hope and peace so rife, O bells, is Christ-like love so plentiful, That ye must wake the world that sleeps, worn out with toil and care, That ye must rend night's quiet With your rejoiceful riot And from tired eyes forgetfulness of blesséd sleep must scare? Are this dead year's last moments, the coming one's dim prospect So fair with happy memories, with Spring-sweet hope so bright? Was that which fades so sweet for us And were its steps so fleet for us That ye must needs proclaim it to the startled ear of night? Is it for our glad progress, in the year that lies a-dying, Toward the dream prophetic of God's kingdom upon earth, Ye break the Yule-night glamour With your clarion-throated clamour, Whilst men are mute for shame before the morning of Christ's birth? Alas! there is no peace for us: the earth is full of misery; The folk are crazed with lust of gain and mean unknightly strife: The earth with blood is weary And the world is bare and dreary, For crime and greed have choked with thorns the amaranth of life. In vain ye fill the air with notes, that tell of hope and gladness: Your throats should ring with dirges for the year that's growing cold, Should wake the folk from sleeping To the coming time of reaping For what they've sown in this dead year, whose days are almost told. Ring, weary bells, from out your spires, and wake the world to consciousness Of all the weary work that lies before the failing feet. Toll for the pest-scathed city, In which there is no pity, Where crime infests each alley and famine chokes each street. Toll for the craze of sightless greed, that blinds the folk to righteousness And bids them set no price on aught that is not bought or sold; Toll for the past year's madness And the coming one's vague sadness; Toll, sad bells, for the new year and the old. BALLADS AND ROMANCES. I.THE RIME OF REDEMPTION. “Traditur etiam nonnullos vi pervincente amoris ipsum contra summum Domini judicium prævaluisse.” Euseb. de Fid. rebus Epist. THE ways are white in the moon's light, Under the leafless trees; Strange shadows go across the snow, Before the tossing breeze. The night, meseems, is full of dreams, Ghosts of the bygone time: Full many a sprite doth walk to-night Over the soundless rime. The burg stands grim upon the rim Of the steep wooded height; In the great hall, the casements tall Flame with the fireside light. From the hearth's womb, athwart the gloom, Rays out the firelight red: Sir Loibich there before the flare Sits in a dream of dread. The tower-light glows across the snows, In the black night defined: The cresset-fire flares high and higher, Tossed by the raging wind. The knight sits bent, with eyes intent Upon the dying fire; Sad dreams and strange in sooth do range Before the troubled sire. He sees the maid the past years laid Upon his breast to sleep, Long dead in sin, laid low within The grave unblest and deep. He sees her tears, her sobs he hears, Borne on the shrieking wind; He sees her hair, so golden-fair, Stream out her form behind. He hears her wail, with lips that fail, To him to save her soul; He sees her laid, unhouselèd, Under the crossless knoll. His heart is wrung, his soul is stung To death with memories: His face grows white as the moon's light And all his words are sighs. “Ah! would, dear Christ, my tears sufficed To ransom her!” he cries: “Sweet Heaven, to win her back from sin, I would renounce the skies. “Might I but bring her suffering To pardon and to peace, I for mine own sin would atone, Where never pain doth cease: “I for my part would gnaw my heart, Chain'd in the flames of hell; I would abide, unterrified, More than a man shall tell.” The flame burns red; he bows his head Upon his joining hands; The wraiths of old are shown and told Upon the dying brands. A hoarse scream tears athwart his ears, Strange howls are in the air; The wolves do stray in search of prey Across the moorlands bare. Red eyes flame forth from south to north, The beasts are all a-chase; God help the wight that goes to-night Among the wild wood-ways! The moon is pale, the night-winds wail, Weird whispers fill the night: “Dear heart, what word was that I heard Ring out in the moonlight? “Methought there came to me my name, Cried with a wail of woe; A voice whose tone my heart had known In the days long ago.” 'Twas but the blast that hurried past, Shrieking among the pines; The souls that wail upon the gale, When the dim starlight shines. Great God! The name! Once more it came Ringing across the dark! “Loibich!” it cried. The night is wide, The dim pines stand and hark. The lead-grey heaven by the blast is riven; God! How the torn trees shriek! The wild wind soughs among the boughs, As though the dead did speak. “Loibich! Loibich! My soul is sick With hungering for thee! The night fades fast, the hours fly past; Stay not, come forth to me!” Great Heaven! The doubt is faded out; It was her voice that spake; He made one stride and open wide The casement tall he strake. The cloudwrack grey did break away; Out shone the ghostly moon; Off slid the haze from all the ways, Before her silver shoon. Pale silver-rayed, out shone the glade, Before the castle wall, And on the lea the knight could see A maid both fair and tall. Gold was her hair, her face was fair, As fair as fair can be, But through the night the blue corpse-light About her could he see. She raised her face toward the place Where Loibich stood adread; There was a sheen in her two een, As one that long is dead. She looked at him in the light dim And beckoned with her hand: “Sir Knight,” she said, “thy prayer hath sped Unto the heavenly land. “Come forth with me: the night is free For us to work the thing That is to do, before we two Shall hear the dawn-bird sing.” He took his brand within his hand, His dirk upon his thigh: And he hath come, through dusk and gloom, Where wide the portals lie. “Saddle thy steed, Sir Knight, with speed, Thy faithfullest,” quoth she, “For many a tide we twain must ride Before the end shall be.” The steed is girt, black Dagobert, Swift-footed as the wind; The knight leapt up upon his croup, The maid sprang up behind. A stately pair the steed doth bear Upon his back to-night: The sweatdrops rain from flank and mane, His eyes start out for fright. Her weight did lack upon his back; He trembled as he stood; It seemed as 'twere a death-cold air Did freeze the courser's blood. She threw the charms of her white arms About Sir Loibich's neck: It seemed as if 't had been a drift Of snow on him did break. The spurs are dyed deep in the side Of the destrere amain; The leaves do chase behind his race And far out streams his mane. The wind screams past; they ride so fast,— Like troops of souls in pain The snowdrifts spin, but none may win To rest upon the twain. So fast they ride, the blasts divide To let them hurry on; The wandering ghosts troop past in hosts Across the moonlight wan. They fly across the frozen floss, Across the frost-starred mead: Hill, wood and plain they cross amain; Hill, plain and wood succeed. The wild wind drops, the snow-whirl stops, Frost fades from grass and brere; The dim clouds die from out the sky And forth the moon shines clear. A sudden hush, and then a rush Of magic melodies; A summer wood, with moon-pearls strewed And jasmine-girdled trees. The lady laid her hand of shade Upon the hurrying horse, And suddenly, upon the lea, He halted in his course. To them there came a fragrant flame, A light of elfinry: The haggard night poured forth delight And flowers of Faërie. A wondrous song did wind along The moon-besilvered glades,— And all the things the elf-night brings Did glitter from the shades. “Light down, Sir Knight, in the moonlight; Light down and loose my hand; I must be gone; but thou hast won Unto the Faery land.” “By Christ His troth!” he swore an oath, “No Faery land for me, Except thou light thee down to-night, Therein with me to be.” “Alas, Sir Knight, I must this night Harbour me far away; Far be 't from thee to rest with me Where I must dwell for aye.” He smote his breast: “By Christ His rest, No Faery land will I! Rather in hell with thee to dwell Than lonely in the sky!” The thunder broke, the lightning-stroke Fell down and tore the earth; The firm ground shook, as though there took The world the throes of birth. The elf-song died, the moon did hide Her face behind the haze, And once again they ride amain Across the wild wide ways. The night grew black; the grey cloudwrack Whirled fast across the skies; What lights are those the white snow throws Reflected in their eyes? What flames are those the blackness shows, Rising like rosy flowers Up to the lift? What ruddy rift Shines out in the night hours? The night is wide: they ride and ride, The lights grow bright and near; There comes a wail upon the gale And eke a descant clear. There comes a plain of souls in pain And eke a high sweet song, As of some fate whose grief is great, But yet whose hope is strong. Aye louder grow the sounds of woe, But the song sweeter still, Until the steed doth slacken speed, At foot of a high hill. The hazes grey before their way Divided are in two; A wondrous sight midmost the night Lies open to their view. The hill is strewn beneath the moon With strange and singing fires; In every flame a soul from shame And soil of sin aspires. From every fire, higher and higher The song of hope doth rise: These are the sprights that God delights To fit for Paradise. “Light down, Sir Knight; I pray, alight; This is the purging-place; Here shalt thou win to cast off sin And come to Christ His grace.” “By Christ His troth!” he swore an oath, “That will I not,” quoth he, “Unless thou too, my lover true, Therein shalt purgèd be.” “Would God,” she said, “the lot were laid For me to enter here! Alack! my stead is with the dead, All in the place of fear. “But thou light down; the gate is thrown Wide open in the ward; See where they stand on either hand, Angels with downdropt sword.” “By Christ His rest!” he smote his breast; “No grace of God will I! Rather with thee damnèd to be Than lonely in the sky!” The night closed round, there came a sound Of trumpets in the air; The steed leapt on, the fires were gone, And on the twain did fare. Through storm and night again their flight They urge o'er hill and plain: What sounds smite clear upon the ear, Through dusk and wind and rain? “Meseems I heard as if there stirr'd A sound of golden lyres; Methought there came a sweet acclaim Of trumpets and of choirs. “So sing the saints, where never faints The sunlight from the skies; So pulse the lyres among the choirs Of God in Paradise.” A singing light did cleave the night; High up a hill rode they; The veils of Heaven for them were riven And all the skies poured day. The golden gate did stand await, The golden town did lie Before their sight, the realms of light God-builded in the sky. The steed did wait before the gate; Sheer up the street look'd they; They saw the bliss in Heaven that is, They saw the saints' array. They saw the hosts upon the coasts Of the clear crystal sea; They saw the blest, that in the rest Of Christ for ever be. The choirs of God pulsed full and broad Upon the ravished twain; The angels' feet upon the street Rang out like golden rain. They felt the sea of ecstasy That flows about the throne; The bliss of heaven to them was given. Awhile to look upon. Then said the maid, “Be not afraid; God giveth heaven to thee; Light down and rest with Christ His blest And think no more of me!” Sir Loibich gazed, as one amazed, Awhile upon the place; Then, with a sigh, he turned his eye Upon the maiden's face. “By Christ His troth!” he swore an oath, “No heaven for me shall be, Except God give that thou shalt live Therein for aye with me.” “Ah, curst am I!” the maid did cry; “My place thou knowest well; I must begone before the dawn, To harbour me in hell.” “By Christ His rest!” he beat his breast, “Then be it even so; With thee in hell I choose to dwell And share with thee thy woe. “Thy sin was mine. By Christ His wine, Mine too shall be thy doom; What part have I within the sky, And thou in Hell's red gloom?” The vision broke, as thus he spoke, The city waned away: O'er hill and brake, o'er wood and lake Once more the darkness lay. O'er hill and plain they ride again, Under the night's black spell, Until there rise against the skies The lurid lights of hell. The night is wide: they ride and ride; The air with smoke grows crost And through the dark their ears may hark The roaring of the lost. The dreadful cries they rend the skies, The plain is ceil'd with fire: The flames burst out, around, about; The heats of hell draw nigher. Unfear'd they ride; against the side Of the red flameful sky Grim forms are shown, strange shades upthrown From out Hell's treasury: Black grisly shapes of demon apes, Grim human-headed snakes, Red creeping things with scaly wings, Born of the sulphur lakes. The flames swell up out of the cup Of endless agony, And with the wind there comes entwined An awful psalmody; The hymning sound of fiends around, Rejoicing in their doom, The fearsome glee of things that be Glad in their native gloom. Fast rode the twain across the plain, With hearts all undismayed, Until they came where all a-flame Hell's gates were open laid. The awful stead gaped wide and red, To gulph them in its womb: There could they see the fiery sea And all the souls in doom. There came a breath, like living death, Out of the gated way: It scorched his face with its embrace, It turned his hair to grey. Then said the maid, “Art not dismayed? Here is our course fulfilled: Wilt thou not turn, nor rest to burn With me, as God hath willed? “By Christ His troth!” he swore an oath, “Thy doom with thee I'll share. Here will we dwell, hand-linked in hell, Unseparate fore'er.” He spurr'd his steed; the gates of dread Gaped open for his course: Sudden outrang a trumpet's clang And backward fell the horse. The ghostly maid did wane and fade, The lights of hell did flee; Alone in night the mazèd wight Stood on the frozen lea. Out shone the moon; the mists did swoon Away before his sight, And through the dark he saw a spark, A welcoming of light. Thither he fared, with falchion bared, Toward the friendly shine; Eftsoon he came to where a flame Did burn within a shrine. A candle stood before the Rood, Christ carven on the tree: Except the shrine, there was no sign Of man that he could see. Down on his knee low louted he Before the cross of wood, And for her spright he saw that night Long prayed he to the Rood. And as he prayed, with heart down-weighed, A wondrous thing befell: The air waxed white and through the night There rang a silver bell. The earth-mists drew before his view; He saw God's golden town; He saw the street, he saw the seat From whence God looketh down. He saw the gate transfigurate, He saw the street of pearl, And in the throng, the saints among, He saw a gold-haired girl. He saw a girl as white as pearl, With hair as red as gold: He saw her stand among the band Of angels manifold. He heard her smite the harp's delight, Singing most joyfully, And knew his love prevailed above Judgment and destiny. Gone is the night; the morn breaks white Across the eastward hill; The knightly sire by the dead fire Sits in the dawning chill. By the hearth white, there sits the knight, Dead as the sunken fire; But on his face is writ the grace Of his fulfilled desire. II.THE BALLAD OF ISOBEL. I. THE day is dead, the night draws on, The shadows gather fast: Tis many an hour yet to the dawn, Till Hallow-tide be past. Till Hallow-tide be past and sped, The night is full of fear; For then, they say, the restless dead Unto the live draw near. Between the Saints' day and the Souls' The dead wake in the mould; The poor dead, in their grassy knolls They lie and are a-cold. They think upon the live that sit And drink the Hallow-ale, Whilst they lie stark within the pit, Nailed down with many a nail. And sore they wonder if the thought Live in them of the dead; And sore with wish they are distraught To feel the firelight red. Betwixt the day and yet the day The Saints and Souls divide, The dead folk rise out of the clay And wander far and wide. They wander o'er the sheeted snow, Chill with the frore of death, Until they see the windows glow With the fire's ruddy breath. And if the cottage door be fast And but the light win out, All night, until their hour is past, The dead walk thereabout. And all night long, the live folk hear Their windy song of sighs And waken all for very fear, Until the white day rise. But if the folk be piteous And pity the poor dead That weary in the narrow house, Upon the cold earth's bed, They pile the peats upon the fire And leave the door ajar, That so the rosy flame aspire To where the grey ghosts are. And syne they sweep the cottage floor And set the hearthside chair: The sad sprights watch beside the door Till midnight still the air. And then toward the friendly glow Come trooping in the dead; Until the cocks for morning crow, They sit by the fire red. II. “Oh, I have wearied long enough! I'll weary me no more; But I will watch for my dead love Till Hallow-tide be o'er.” He set the door across the sill; The moonlight fluttered in; The sad snow covered heath and hill, As far as eye could win. The thin frost feathered in the air; All dumb the white world lay; Night sat on it as cold and fair As death upon a may. He turned him back into the room And sat him by the fire: Night darkened round him in the gloom; The shadowtide rose higher. He rose and looked out o'er the hill To where the grey kirk lay; The midnight quiet was so still, He heard the bell-chimes play. Twelve times he heard the sweet bell chime; No whit he stirred or spoke; But his eyes fixed, as if on Time The hour of judgment broke. And as the last stroke fell and died, Over the kirkyard grey Himseemed he saw a blue flame glide, Among the graves at play. A flutter waved upon the breeze, As of a spirit's wings: A wind went by him through the trees, That spoke of heavenly things. Him seemed he heard a sound of feet Upon the silver snow: A rush of robes by him did fleet, A sighing soft and low. He turned and sat him down again; The midnight filled the place: The tears ran down like silent rain Upon his weary face. “She will not come to me,” he said; “The death-swoon is too strong: She hath forgot me with the dead, Me that she loved so long. “She will not come: she sleeps too sweet Within the quiet ground. What worth is love, when life is fleet And sleep in death so sound? “She will not come!”— A soft cold air Upon his forehead fell: He turned him to the empty chair; And there sat Isobel. His dead love sat him side by side, His minnie white and wan: Within the tomb she could not bide, Whilst he sat weeping on. Ah, wasted, wasted was her face And sore her cheek was white; But in her eyes the ancient grace Burnt with a feeble light. Upon her breast the grave-wede grey Fell to her little feet; But still the golden tresses lay About her bosom sweet. “Ah, how is't with ye, Isobel? How pale ye look and cold! Ah, sore it is to think ye dwell Alone beneath the mould! “Is't weary for our love ye've grown From dwelling with the dead, Or shivering from the cold grave-stone To find the firelight red?” “Oh, 'tis not that I'm lorn of love Or that a-cold I lie: I trust in God that is above To bring you by-and-by. “I feel your kisses on my face, Your kisses sweet and warm: Your love is in the burial-place; I fear nor cold nor worm. “I feel the love within your heart That beats for me alone: I fear not change upon your part Nor crave for the unknown. “For to the dead no faint fears cling: All certainty have they: They know (and smile at sorrowing) Love never dies away. “No harm can reach me in Death's deep: It hath no fear for me: God sweetens it to lie and sleep, Until His face I see: “He makes it sweet to lie and wait, Till we together meet And hand-in-hand athwart the gate Pass up the golden street. “But where's the babe that at my side Slept sweetly long ago? So sore to me to-night it cried, I could not choose but go. “I heard its voice so full of wail, It woke me in the grave: Its sighs came to me on the gale, Across the wintry wave. “For though death lap her wide and mild, A mother cannot rest, Except her little sucking child Be sleeping at her breast.” “Ah, know'st thou not, my love?” he said: “Methought the dead knew all. When in that night of doom and dread The moving waters' wall “Smote on our ship and drove it down Beneath the raging sea, All of our company did drown, Alas! save only me. “And me the cruel billows cast Aswoon upon the strand; Thou dead within mine arms held fast, Hand locked in other's hand. “The ocean never to this day Gave up our baby dead: Ah, woe is me that life should stay, When all its sweet is fled!” “Go down,” said she, “to the seashore: God taketh ruth on thee: Search well; and I will come once more Ere yet the midnight be.” She bent her sweet pale mouth to his: The snowdrift from the sky Falls not so cold as did that kiss: He shook as he should die. She looked on him with yearning eyes And vanished from his sight: He heard the matin cock crow thrice; The morning glimmered white. Then from his place he rose and sought The shore beside the sea: And there all day he searched; but nought Until the eve found he. At last a pale star glittered through The growing dusk of night And fell upon the waste of blue, A trembling wand of light. And lo! a wondrous thing befell: As though the small star's ray Availed to break some year-old spell That on the water lay, A white form rose out of the deep, Where it so long had lain, Cradled within the cold death-sleep: He knew his babe again. It floated softly to his feet; White as a flower it lay: Christ's love had kept its body sweet Unravished of decay. He thanked God weeping for His grace; And many a tear he shed And many a kiss upon its face That smiled as do the dead. Then to the kirkyard where the maid Slept cold in clay he hied; And with a loving hand he laid The baby by her side. III. The dark fell down upon the earth; Night held the quiet air: He sat before the glowing hearth, Beside the empty chair. Twelve times at last for middle night Rang out the kirkyard bell: Ere yet the twelfth was silent quite, By him sat Isobel. Within her arms their little child Lay pillowed on her breast: Death seemed to it as soft and mild As heaven to the blest. Ah, no more wasted was her face, Nor white her cheek and wan! The splendour of a heavenly grace Upon her forehead shone. She seemed again the golden girl Of the long-vanished years: Her face shone as a great sweet pearl, Washed and made white in tears. The light of heaven filled her eyes With soft and splendid flame; Out of the heart of Paradise It seemed as if she came. He looked upon her beauty bright; And sore, sore sorrowed he, To think how many a day and night Between them yet must be. He looked at her with many a sigh; For sick he was with pain, To think how many a year must fly Ere they two met again. She looked on him: no sadness lay Upon her tender mouth; And syne she smiled, a smile as gay And glad as in her youth. “Be of good cheer, dear heart,” said she: “Yet but a little year Ere thou and I together see The end of doubt and fear. “Come once again the saints' night ring Unto the spirits' feet, Glad with the end of sorrowing, Once more we three shall meet; “We three shall meet no more to part For all eternity: 'Gin I come not to thee, sweetheart, Do thou come then to me.” IV. Another year is past and gone: Once more the lingering light Fades from the sky and dusk falls down Upon the Holy Night. The hearth is clear; the fire burns red; The door stands open wide: He waits for the belovèd dead To come with Hallow-tide. The midnight rings out loud and slow Across the frosty air: He sits before the firelight-glow, Beside the waiting chair. The last chime dies into the night: The stillness grows apace: And yet there comes no lady bright To fill the empty place. No soft hand falls upon his hair; No light breath fans his brow: The night is empty everywhere; The birds sleep on the bough. “Ah woe is me! the night fades fast; Her promise is forgot: Alas!” he said, “the hours fly past, And still she cometh not! “So sweet she sleeps and sleeps with her The baby at her breast, No thought of earthly love can stir Their undesireful rest. “Ah, who can tell but Time may lay Betwixt us such a space That haply at the Judgment Day She will forget my face.” The still night quivered as he spoke; He felt the midnight air Throb and a little breeze awoke Across the heather bare. And in the wind himseemed he heard His true love's voice once more: Afar it came, and but one word “Come!” unto him it bore. A faint hope flickered in his breast: He rose and took his way Where underneath the brown hill's crest The quiet kirkyard lay. He pushed the lychgate to the wall: Against the moonless sky The grey kirk towered dusk and tall: Heaven seemed on it to lie. Dead darkness held the holy ground; His feet went in and out And stumbled at each grassy mound, As one that is in doubt. Then suddenly the sky grew white; The moon thrust through the gloom: The tall tower's shade against her light Fell on his minnie's tomb. Full on her grave its shadow fell, As 'twere a giant's hand, That motionless the way doth tell Unto the heavenly land. He fell upon his knees thereby And kissed the holy earth, Wherein the only twain did lie That made life living-worth. He knelt; no longer did he weep; Great peace was on his soul: Sleep sank on him, a wondrous sleep, Assaining death and dole. And in the sleep himseemed he stood Before a high gold door, Upon whose midst the blessèd Rood Burnt like an opal's core. Christ shining on the cross to see Was there for all device: Within he saw the almond-tree That grows in Paradise. He knew the fallen almond-flowers That drop without the gate, So with their scent the tardy hours Be cheered for those that wait. And as he looked, a glimmering light Shone through the blazoned bars: The wide tall gate grew blue and bright As Heaven with the stars. A postern opened in his face; Sweet savours breathed about; And through the little open space A fair white hand came out: A hand as white as ermolin, A hand he knew full well, Beckoned to him to enter in— The hand of Isobel. Lord Christ, Thy morning tarrieth long: The shadows come and go: These three have heard the angels' song; Still many wait below. These three on Heaven's honey feed And milk of Paradise: How long before for us indeed The hills of Heaven rise? How long before, joined hand-in-hand With all the dear-loved dead, We pass along the heavenly land And hear the angels' tread? The night is long: the way is drear: Our hearts faint for the light: Vouchsafe, dear Lord, the day draw near, The morning of Thy sight! III.INTO THE ENCHANTED LAND. WHEN the end of the enchantment of the Summer is at hand, In the month that closes The blue Midsummer weather, When the passionate red roses Faint for the heat And the lilies fold together Their petals pale and sweet,— In the burning noontide hazes And the golden glory of the flowers that blazes Over the happy valleys and the wold, There swells to me a breeze ofttimes Out of the dreams of old. And in the breeze the murmur of old rhymes Rises and falls, Like some enchanted singing, And my tired brow is fanned By odours from the halls Of dreamland, such as in the moonlight white Float round a wandering knight, When through the country of the elves he fares And marvels at the dances, That glitter through the moon-glow, and the ringing Of elfin bells; And through the fluttering of the frolic airs, In all the song there swells A voice well known to me of bygone days, That calls me to forsake The weary worldly ways And as of olden times my way to take Into the dreamland of the old romances, Into the enchanted land. Down falls the evening on the weary plains, And I, I stand and wait Where, at the verge Of the green fields, the stains Of sunlight fade upon the trees that surge Out of the falling night, Dim as the dreamland's gate. And so there comes to me a flash of light Across the shadow and my faint eyes know The robe of her I love And the bright crown of tresses aureoled, Star-glorious, above Her face's rosy snow, Spangling the shades with gold. ‘Sweet love, sweet welcome! I had need of thee, Sore, sorest need!’ Still doth she grow Nearer and lovelier till my arms may press Almost her charms and all my soul may feed Upon her loveliness. But lo! I clasp the wind And in mine arms entwined Is nothing but a fair and painted dream. ‘Dear love, why dost thou seem And torture me with hope in vain?’ And the fair shape doth weep And comforteth my pain With lovely looks and words of amity; And so my yearnings sleep And there is peace once more for me. ‘Come, love,’ she saith, ‘the dream-gates gape for thee. The hour of glamorous delight Is come for thee and me. Under the silver night We shall walk hand in hand In the enchanted land And see the moon-flowers blossom to the sound Of the sweet elfin tune, As in the days gone by. Dost thou not hear the horns of Faerie wound Among the elfland bowers And all the rush of splendid song that floods The silver winds that lie And idle in the pearl-work of the moon, Woven about the woods? Come, love! the day is dead, With all its weary hours, And ours is newly born. Thou shalt have easance of thy woes this night, Amid the glory of the flowers that swoon With magical delight, Ere in the sky creeps up the weary morn And the pale East grows red.’ So, in the pale faint flush of the twilight, Softly I ope the door And hand in hand, Across the fields we go, before The day is parted from the night, Among the cloisters where the tall trees stand, White in the woodland ways, Under the moonlight, till a wall of mist Rises before us in the evening haze, Silver and amethyst. Then doth my love loose hands And in the spangled green Of the thick moss she stands Within the wood-verge, where the sun has been And is not faded quite; And to the hovering night Sweet mystic lays And songs she singeth, very pure and high, Until there answereth From out the heart-green of the woodbine maze A magic singing, as it were A woven music of the scents that lie In all the night-flowers' breath; And with the song upon the fragrant air Strange mystic memories do swell and die Of Love and Life and Death. The gate of dreamland opens to the singing And hand in hand we go, My love and I, Along the woodways with the elf-songs ringing, Under the silver night; And down the vistas of the trees, that lie And bathe in the moonlight, There swells to us a murmur sweet and low, As of some magic river, That glitters through its ranks of waving reeds And makes the flower-bells quiver With haunting melodies; And from its ferny nest The runnel of a brooklet sings and speeds Across the pearlèd network of the grass, Murmuring its loveliest, Songs of a heart at ease, That in its joy doth pass Into a tune; and lo! Upon the diamond ripples to our feet A little shallop floats, Out of a rush-work woven all and wrought With pearls and ivory. Then in the skiff do we Embark and down the silver stream we fleet, Under the thronging notes Of the night-birds; And as we go, The air is all astir with lovely things; Sweet music, twinned and fair with magic words, Rises from elfin throats, And in the leaves we see the rush and glow Of jewelled wings. There lies all glamour in the arching banks, Through which our river runs: Over us wing the dreams And in the pale sweet trances of the moon, Along the stretching glades, The silver fawns of Faërie do pass, White in the sweet white beams; And now and then the tune Of horns is clear And the elf-hunt sweeps by, with glittering ranks, Across the velvet grass: The king's tall knightly sons Ride through the aisles, with many a doucepere; And now there comes a throng Of snow-white maids, Gold-haired, That with sweet song And pleasance wander in the fragrant maze Of the cool woodland ways, Sweet one with sweet one paired, All through the summer night, And win the enchanted air Unto melodious trances with the ring Of their flute-voices and the rare delight Of their gold-rippled hair, Soft as the songs they sing. The high trees bend above us lovingly, As on the stream we go, Mingling their boughs above Into a flower-starred roof Of lovely greenery; And through the night The fireflies glow And glitter, as it were The stars had left their places for delight And through the woodland air Sped, singing. The stream makes music to the cleaving prow, Answering the birds' descant And the soft ringing Of bindweed bells. The night is filled with spells Of old delight; The summer air is hazed and jubilant With ripples of the glory of song-gold And elfin blisses; And in the lovely light, A maiden more than earthly fair to see, With moon-webs aureoled, My lady sits by me, Answering my thought with kisses. The river shallows through the grass and flowers, Athwart the waning night; And now the boat is gone From underneath our feet; And eke the stream has faded Into the ripple of the white moonlight. So, in the midwood bowers I stand alone In the still time and sweet Before the hour when night and morning meet. Sweet sooth, the moon has braided The air with pearl And down the haunted glades The shadows dance and whirl Among the sheeny hosts of the grass-blades, In the cool glitter of the time: And lo! my thought takes rhythm from their dances And to my lips comes rhyme And many a lovely tune, Such as the minstrels of the old romances Sang to the moon. My singing echoes through the elfland aisles, Waking the silver bells, That lie and dream in the flower-sleep, Deep in the mossy dells; And as I sing, The timid rabbits creep From all their soft warm nests among the fern; And in the wood-deeps, gold and silver strewn, The fawns stand listening. Then down the columned way, Through which the moonlight smiles, There rings the trample of a horse's feet. Nearer it grows along the ripple-play, Beside the tinkling burn, Until the silver armour of a knight Shines in the moon And a clear voice trolls songs of war and love, Ditties of strange and mystical delight, That through the trees do rove, Telling of Day and Night, Of Love and Life and Death, With strains as bright and sweet As is the linnet's breath. My weak song ceases as I look on him: ‘Fair knight, Fair minstrel, teach me all thy might. I know thee as of old: Clear through the twilight of the legends dim, Thy name like gold Doth shine And the fair nobleness of thy white life Sweetens the lips of men, O Percivale, Christ's knight!’ And then he gazes on me with mild eyes And the clear rapture floods me like a wine Of some old Orient tale, Purging my heart from sighs And memories of strife. And so he rides into the gloaming pale, Scattering on every hand Sweet singings, till they die upon the ear. Then, looking round again, I see the night has ceased And in the dawning drear My dream fades from me, as the skies are spanned By the red bars of morn And in the East The cold gray day is born. IV.SIR WINFRITH. I. THE woodlarks welcome the risen day; The ringdoves croon in the cool wood-way; The meads are telling the tale of May. Sir Winfrith fares through the forest wide; The glad Spring greets him on every side; The brakes are ablaze with the blossom-tide. The glades, as he rideth, with glee-notes ring; The cuckoos call him, the woodlarks sing, “Ah, whither away, Sir Son of the King?” “Ah, whither so sadly?” The throstles cry. “Who ever the son of a king heard sigh, When the sun is aloft in the love-month's sky And the larks are a-lilt in the blue above?” “Alack for the lurdane,” rejoins the dove, “Who fareth alone for default of love, Who goeth a-gloom in the gladsome day, Who's dumb for desire in the merry May, When all things else in the world are gay? Who ever heard tell of the son of a king, That sitteth forlorn in the flowered Spring, When the brakes are a-bloom and the birds do sing?” The king's son rideth; he heareth nought: His brows are bound with the thorns of thought; He fareth alone, unsquired, unsought. He rideth sans huntsman or merry moot; His eyes are heedless, his lips are mute; He's deaf to the beck of the blackbird's flute; He lendeth no ear to the linnet's lyre; His soul is aflame with a seething fire; His heart is heavy for wandesire. But hark! what hushes the throstle's throat? What wild sweet sound in the air's afloat, That all-to muteth the wild merle's note? A surge of song through the flowered trees, A flood of fair tones and melodies, That fareth a-wing on the wayward breeze; A surge of singing so sweet and high, It floodeth the forest far and nigh, It beareth the soul to the bovemost sky. It stirreth the spright with its blithesome breath; It filleth the heart with hope and faith, With love undeeming of life and death. The sweet sounds waken Sir Winfrith's ear; His sense they deluge, his dreams they stir; He stayeth his steed anon to hear. So still he sitteth that who alone Had lighted on him thus stirless grown Had held him a man on a steed of stone. Awhile he sitteth, till all around The magic music hath weft and wound His heart with its viewless webs of sound: Then, fenceless drawn by his longing's force, He lighteth down from his careless course And tethereth thereanigh his horse. Through thorn and thicket, through bog and brake, 'Twixt doubt and deeming, 'twixt sleep and wake, He fareth on for that sweet song's sake. Down sinketh the sun in the dark'ning West And still Sir Winfrith, with panting breast, Unfeared, ensueth that fleeting quest: And still the singing before him flees, Now farther borne by the faithless breeze, Now nearer turning among the trees. Good heart, Sir Winfrith! The goal is nigh. Good heart to the chase! The tree-tops high Show thinlier ever against the sky. And lo! where he comes, in the sunset hour, To a glade in the midmost forest bower, And there in the midst a darkling tower. No cresset flares from the turret's height; No beacon beckons with lovesome light; No window welcomes the wandering knight: Nay, there all darkling the tower doth stand, The finger like of a giant hand Uplift to threaten the heavenly land. But lo! from the top, like a golden bell, The tones of the voice ineffable In refluent melodies wane and swell. Blithe is Sir Winfrith; he thinketh fast The bird and the music to have at last; He holdeth the pain and the labour past. But, though he seeketh on all sides four, No sign he seeth of gate or door, Nor port nor postern, behind, before, Nor wicket nor window open-eyed. Blank is the bastion's every side, Nought but the walls and the forest wide. His horn he windeth both loud and high; The wild wood echoes it far and nigh: Except the echo there's no reply. But still that voice from the turret tall In waves of music doth rise and fall, With maddening melody flooding all. Sad is Sir Winfrith: the bird is there; But built is its nest in the topmost air; 'Tis far from his hand as heaven's stair. The music holds him; he may not flee; And something warns him to wait and see; He wakes and watches behind yon tree. II. The sun dips under and all about The tents of the moon a rabble-rout Of clouds is camping; no star shines out. The birds are silent both far and nigh; The breeze in the boughs hath ceased to sigh; The black night blindeth the earth and sky. The voice is dumb with the vanished light, The music mute for the fallen night; Dead darkness holdeth the turret's height. But lo! in the midnight mirk and drear A shudder runs through the air of fear, A sense of somewhat of evil near. The live night throbs with the thrill of dread That stirs in the heart whose blood runs red At sight and sense of the risen dead. And sudden he feels, though his eyes see nought, There pass him by, with the speed of thought, A thing as swift as the thin fire-flaught; A wraith from the middle darkness' womb, Of curses compound and death and doom: And down by the tower-foot there rends the gloom A voice like an osprey's shriek a-scare, A cry that shrills through the shrivelled air; “Rapunzel! Minion! Down with thy hair!” There beams at the tower-top something bright And down by the wall, through the startled night, There slides what himseems is a ladder of light; A glittering fleece of golden hair, From top to tower-foot it floateth there; It hangs from the height like a shining stair. Some black beast-thing on the tress lays hold And speeds to the top by that stair of gold: Ah God! 'tis a wizened witch-wife old! A beldam, whose hands like bird-claws show, With nose like a beak and eyes that glow Like red-hot coals through her locks of snow. She wins to the top: without a sound, The fleece floats up, as a skein is wound; In dusk and silence the night is drowned. The gleam is gone from the turret's height; Abideth nothing for sound or sight; All dark and still as the still dark night. Frozen with fear is Sir Winfrith's blood; He knows the witch-wife that haunts the wood, Who hateth all that is fair and good. The glad day gleams on the Eastern hill; The tower stands darkling and stern and still; Sir Winfrith forth of the forest will. Through thorn and thicket his last night's track He follows; he springs on his horse's back; He fares to his father's palace back. III. Again on the morrow, with risen day, Ere morning have done the mists away, Again through the forest he takes his way. He wins to the tower at the time of noon, The hour when enchantments wane and swoon, That work their most with the waxing moon. The tower stands darkling; on all sides four He seeketh it round, as he sought before, But no sign seeth of gate or door; Then stands and calls through the sunlit air, “Rapunzel! Sweet one! Down with thy hair!” And down, like a fleece, falls the golden stair. There, full at his feet, is the shining stream, A stairway wrought of the gold sun's beam, A pathway of price in a fairy dream. The King's son grippeth the shimmering strand; A tress he holdeth in either hand; They rise and raise him at his command. In less than a score of time to tell, He wins to the topmost turret-cell; He stands by the side of Rapunzel. Before him standeth a maiden bright, With eyes of heaven and locks of light; Ne'er live man looked on a lovelier sight. She gazes on him and he on her; The Spring and love in them live and stir, Youth's blood aflame with the blossomed year. Love to love, longing to longing, call; They kiss, in each other's arms they fall; The night with its curtain covers all. IV. Once more, on the morrow, the morning sun, Arising, ready its course to run, Awakens from sleep the stout King's son. He armeth him well against assail, Himself and his steed from head to tail In armour of proof of Milan mail. He giveth him out for bounden war To wage to the death on the fierce wild boar That haunteth the heart of the forest core. The mass of the hunter for him they sing Who dareth alone a deathly thing, Who setteth his life on the venturing. The cross in the chapel he hath adored; The priest hath hallowed his broad bright sword, Hath sacred it o'er with the sign of the Lord. A ladder of silk he hath letten make, A ladder of proof, that may not break, He hath letten twist for his true love's sake. He hath bounden it on his saddle-bow; With him is he minded to bear it, so She win with it may from aloft alow. But time hastes by and the hour grows late; The sun hangs high in the noontide strait, Ere forth he fareth the palace-gate. Through thorn and thicket again his way He takes, till the land with the parting ray Is all adream of the dying day. To the midwood glade, with the darkling tower, Where black on the blaze is the maiden's bower, He wins at the wane of the sunset hour. He lights, he calls to the maiden fair, “Rapunzel! Dearest! Down with thy hair!” And down to his feet floats the fairy stair. He grips on the tresses, he holds them well; They bear him aloft to the turret-cell; Alack! there finds he no Rapunzel. But there, in the damsel's stead, ah woe! The witch-wife waiteth, with hair of snow, With hands like talons and eyes aglow. She falls on the knight with tooth and nail; His weapons against her nought avail; She claws for his heart through his shirt of mail. She clutches his heart with claws of steel; Already his limbs the death-sweats feel; Already his eyes the death-mists seal. His forces fail him; his heart bleeds sore; His sense is swooning; he can no more: Yet but a moment and all is o'er. But sudden the thought of the holy sign There thrills through his heart like a levin-shine, And gripping his blade by the steel so fine, He calleth aloud on the name of the Lord; Then strikes at the witch with the cross of the sword And dead she drops on the tower-foot sward. V. Now blithe is Sir Winfrith, the son of the King; He hath broughten him home his tenderling; He hath wedded his bird with book and ring. He sitteth in joy and him beside, There sitteth with him his lovesome bride; No longer lonely he needs must ride; No longer the linnets to him shall sing, “Who ever heard tell of the son of a king, That fareth forlorn in the sunny Spring?” VI. Still frowns on the forest the darkling tower; But never again in the midnight hour The walls with the flashing tresses flower; And never again from the turret-cell The voice of the viewless Rapunzel Soars up to the sky like a golden bell. The place of magic is void and mute; No sound is there, save the throstle's flute, The nightingale's note and the howlet's hoot; And never again, in the midnight-air, The voice of the witch will the silence scare With “Rapunzel! Minion! Down with thy hair!” V.THE KING'S SLEEP. ‘BURY me deep,’ said the king, ‘Deep in the mountain's womb; For I am weary of strife. Hollow me out a tomb, So that the golden sun Pierce not the blackness dun Where I shall lie and sleep; Lest haply the light should bring Again the stirring of life, Or ever the time be come To waken. Bury me deep. ‘Let not the silver moon Search out the graven stone That lieth above my head, In the tomb where I sleep alone, Nor any ray of a star Come in the night to unbar The gates of my prison-sleep. I shall awake too soon From the quiet sleep of the dead, When the trumps of the Lord are blown. If you love me, bury me deep. ‘I feel in my heart of hearts There cometh a time for me, Far in the future's gloom, When there no more may be Rest for my weary head, When over my stony bed The wind of the Lord shall sweep And scatter the tomb in parts And the voice of the angel of doom Shall thrill through and waken me Out of my stirless sleep. ‘For a king that has been a king, That has loved the people he swayed, Has bound not his brows in vain With the gold and the jewelled braid; Has held not in his right hand The symbol that rules the land, The sceptre of God for nought. He may not escape the thing He compassed: in death again His sleep is troubled and weighed By wraiths of the deeds he wrought. ‘And if he has evil done, There may he lie and rest Under the storied stone, Slumber, uneasy, opprest By the ghosts of his evil deeds, Till Death with his pallid steeds Have smitten the world with doom: And the moon and the stars and the sun Will leave him to sleep alone, Fearing to shine on him, lest The wicked arise from the tomb! ‘But if the ruler be wise, Have wrought for his people's good Sadly and like a god; Whenever the plague-mists brood Over the kingless land, When fire and famine and brand Are loose and the people weep, They cry to the king to rise; And under the down-pressed sod, He hears their pitiful cries And stirs in his dreamful sleep. ‘And the sun and the stars and the moon Look down through the creviced tomb And rend with their arrows of light The sepulchre's friendly gloom, Stirring the life again In pulse and muscle and vein; And the winds, that murmur and sweep Over his resting-place, croon And wail in his ear: “The night Is past and the day is come; O king, arise from thy sleep!” The sleeper murmurs and sighs,— Rest is so short and sweet, Life is so long and sad,— And he throws off his winding-sheet: The gates of the tomb unclose And out in the world he goes, Weary and careful, to reap The harvest, on hero-wise To garner the good, and the bad To burn, ere the Ruler shall mete Him yet a portion of sleep. ‘Great is the Master of Life And I bow my head to His will! When He needs me, the Lord will call And I shall arise and fill The span of duty once more. But now I am weary and sore With travail and need of sleep; And I fear lest the clangour and strife Upon me again should fall, Ere sleep shall have healed my ill. I pray you, bury me deep!’ So the good king was dead And the people wrought him a grave Deep in the mountain's womb, In a place where the night-winds rave And the centuries come and go, Unheard of the dead below; Where never a ray might creep; In the rocks where the rubies red And the diamonds grow in the gloom, They hollowed the king a tomb, Low and vaulted and deep. And there they brought him to lie: With wailing and many a tear, The people bore to the place The good king's corpse on the bier. They perfumed his funeral glooms With lily and amaranth blooms, In a silence sweet and deep; They piled up the rocks on high And there, with a smile on his face, In doubt and sadness and fear, They left the monarch to sleep. Onward the centuries rolled And the king slept safely and sound In the heart of the faithful earth, In the still death-slumbers bound: And the sun and the moon and the stars Looked wistfully down on the bars Of the sepulchre quiet and deep, Where he lay, while the world grew old And death succeeded to birth, And heard not an earthly sound And saw not a sight in his sleep. And it came to pass that the Wind Spake once and said to the Sun: ‘O giver of summer-life! Is not the time fordone And the measure of God fulfilled, Wherein He, the Lord, hath willed The king should arise from sleep? I go in the night and I find The folk are weary of strife, And joyless is every one And many an eye doth weep!’ But the Sun said, shaking his hair, His glorious tresses of gold: “Brother, the grave is deep; And the rocks so closely do fold The king, that we may not win A place where to enter in And trouble his slumber deep.” And the Wind said: “Where I fare, The rays of the sun can creep, Through the thin worm-holes in the mould, And rouse the king from his sleep!” Then the Moon and the Stars and the Sun Arose and shone on the grave, And it was as the Wind had said: Yea, up from the vaulted cave The worms had crept in the night And opened a way for the light And the winds of the air to creep. And they entered, one by one; Yea, down to the house of the dead, Through cranny and rock they clave, To wake the king from his sleep. And the king turned round in his dream, As he felt the terrible rays Creeping down through the mould In the track of the false worms' ways; And he quaked as the light drew near And he called to the earth for fear, To aid him his rest to keep; For the time he had slept did seem But an hour, nor the wheels of gold Had circled the span of days When he should arise from sleep. But the mother all-faithful heard The dreaming call of the king, And she seized on the wandering rays And of each one she made a thing Of jewelries, such as grow In the dim earth-caves below, From the light kept long and deep; For she loved the man and she feared Lest the fateful glitter and blaze Of the light too early should bring The dead from his goodly sleep. She moulded pearls of the moon And diamonds of the sun; Rubies and sapphires she made Of the star-rays, every one. There was never an one might 'scape Some luminous jewel-shape Of all the rays that did creep Down through the earth, too soon To rend the sepulchre's shade; But she seized on them all, and none Might trouble the dead man's sleep. Then did she mould him a crown Of silver and cymophane And in it the gems she set, For a sign that never again, Till God should beckon to him, On the silence quiet and dim Of the sepulchre low and deep Should the rays of the stars look down To trouble his rest. And yet The centuries wax and wane And the king is still in his sleep. VI.MADONNA DEI SOGNI. “La veggio scintillar d'amore, Quando spiega la notte il negro velo.” Tasso, Sonetti Amorosi, cix O come, for I am weary of the day, White-wingéd Night, that holdest to thy breast The sorrowing and dost give the weary rest, And fan the sunshafts of the noon away! For one, that is full fair and kind alway, Waits in the gloaming, till the aspiring moon Have whelmed the world with silver, to untune The tense harsh harp of day and soothe the air With ravishment of music wild and rare And stir my soul to harmonies of dreams. Where dost thou tarry, sweet? The night is fair And every star thine eyes' far radiance seems. O haste! Too soon the flowerful hands of dawn Shall strew with roses every eastern lawn. In that fair pleasaunce, where on Beatrice The eyes of Dante slaked their lifelong thirst, My eyes did light upon my lady first. I had been wandering through the night, I wis Not how, and came to where soft airs did kiss The frondage and the trees shone everydele With silver of the moon; and I did feel That there the Springtime never died away Nor ripened to fierce summer; but the May Did ever consecrate the place to sleep And silver dreams. There did my fain steps stray: And there I saw thee on a bank's slow steep; And thou didst on my coming turn my way And look'dst upon me with mild eyes and deep. Thou wast upon a plaited bed reclined Of hyacinths, the colour of thine eyes. The moon of dreams did reign in those sweet skies And therein such entrancements did I find Of fantasy and wisdom intertwined, That my faint soul became its satellite And drew new radiance from that loveliest light. Beside thee blew the flower-dream of the Spring, Faint primrose, delicat'st and sweetest thing Of all the lush year brings us; and its scent Ethereal, on the cool dusk hovering, Seemed as the fragrance of thy soul and blent Itself and thee in my remembering, As 'twere the Spring and thou but one bliss meant. Thy hair lay gold upon the silvered grass And floated on it, as a flower's full cup And golden tassels float and waver up Athwart a lake's cool crystal, through whose glass The flooding moon forbids the eye to pass. I deemed thee but a dream within a dream, When first thou shon'st upon me,— all agleam With glamour,— and did look to see thee fade Into the faint far purple of the glade, As I approached; but lo! thou didst arise, And nearing, on my lips thy finger laid,— Then, smiling with a sweetness high and wise, Withdrew'st that wand of white and in its stead, Didst kiss me welcome on the mouth and eyes. The night was fragrant as a violet With perfume of the early bloom of love; The silence hovered o'er us, like a dove Of peace, and in the ferns the brook did fret Its stones to music. All my dreams were set In silver and all sad old memories, Reflected in the glory of thine eyes, Did change to jewels, as a pebble laves Its brown to pearl and jacinth, in the wave's Alchymic crystal. Through the weary day, I courted woes, that thou mightst dig them graves Deep in thy bosom and upon them lay Balsam of kisses and the love that saves The holy sweets of sorrow from decay. Can I forget how all the night did pause And hung upon the wonder of thy words? How, whilst thou spokest comfort, all the birds Did intermit their lays? Thou wast the cause That all were silent; for the woodland laws Forbid the lesser songsters to prevail Against the flutings of the nightingale. Thou didst attune to mnsic all my sighs And told'st my sorrows on such lovely wise, That every fierce old sting of barbed wrong Seemed rounded with a dream of Paradise And linked into a cadence sweet and long Of haunting thoughts and tender memories, Fallen in the ripple of a perfect song. My heaven with the setting sun was red: Life was for me a waste without a smile And I a Philoctetes on his isle. But at thy kiss my gladness, that was dead, Did burst the bonds of night; the shadows fled And all the curtains of the dusk were drawn; My sky once more was amber with the dawn And I could watch to hail the new day's sun With daybreak hope; for I at last had won Full-breasted Love, that is the flower of life; What though in dreams? If living, scarce begun, Be bitter in the mouth with pain and strife And loveless, 'tis in it we are undone And in our dreams we have the truer life. I reach into the ancient troubled deep— Where many a rank old poison-weed has lain And ripened to corruption— and again Uproot them from their long and sullen sleep, Expecting but that tears of blood they'll weep And wring my heart to bleeding. Through the flood, Curdled and foul and sick with year-old mud, They rise, all hideous with remembered woe, Up to the surface of the pool, and lo! Thine eyes have won their nature to such fair And exquisite forswearing, with their glow Of tender glory, that the dank stems wear A sudden garb of flowerage sweet and rare And are all consecrate with blossom-snow. So I forget the present in thine eyes, And all my future is but one embrace Of thine encircling arms, my hope thy face And guerdon of thy kisses. Sorrow dies And lives again in such delightsome guise That pain is pleasure and the weary past With Spring-flower-chains is bounden close and fast To wait on Love and wring a sharp sweet pain Out of old bitter cypress and vervain, To lend new savour to his charmèd wine. The bitter herbs that erst have been my bane, Curdling the young blood's valour in each vein, Striking new root in that rich heart of thine, To change their souls to balsam have been fain. I cull for thee a garland of sweet names, Made fragrant with the perfume of fair deeds: And lo! meseems they fade to scentless weeds; For there is that in thee that naming shames And wills to be Love's only, and not Fame's. How shall I call thee, sweet? or not at all? Yet mine ears weary till upon them fall The linkèd music of thy name's sweet sound, That with its phrases may entwine around My heartstrings all the memories of thy breath, Thy kisses and thine arms about me wound. How shall I call thee, love? “Love,” Echo saith. What if for thee my foolish wit have found No other name save Love,—or haply Death? Sweet, I have tracked thy footsteps in the wood, Hard by the river of the death of pain “Da questa parte con virtù discende, Che toglie altrui memoria del peccato; Dall' altra d'ogni ben fatto la rende.” Dante, Purgatorio, xxviii. 127—9., And for my heart's poor solace have been fain To gather violets where thy feet have stood And wooed the earth to flowering. Oh, I would That I might see thee standing in the dawn Upon the glad green of some upland lawn, Before the blue day's waking,—aureoled With some pale tender flush of early gold, Saint-purely vestured as a lily's bell In fair white garments, falling fold on fold, And just one blush of purple, such as fell Upon the wounded white-rose-leaves of old, To show Love's light does in that sweet snow dwell! O lady of my dreams, the night is past; The pale day wakens and the east is red. Thou, that dost shun the young day's lustihead, Where dost thou harbour, when the stars fade fast Into the burning and the world is ghast With wraiths of dawning? Do thy swift feet skim The primrose tufts that edge the rill's full brim Or dost thou sit in gold-green woodland nooks And weave new store of dream-sweet words and looks, In place of those worn weary by the night's Long inter-ravishments, and twine thy hair Into new webs of woven eye-delights, Following the brook's clear glitter and the air Waved with a softened ripple of gold-lights? A place of woven flowers and singing winds, Jewelled with moss and plumed with nodding ferns; A hall of silver silence, wherein burns A soft star-glamour. Through the moss that binds Fern-roots with gold, a slow clear water winds And slackens into tiny pools of light, Pale topaz, amethyst and chrysolite, Set in the gilded tracery of the grass: And there the charmèd hours do lingering pass, Unwilling to forsake so fair a place. In such a haunt I picture thee by day, Stirring the air to rapture with the grace Of thy sweet songs and wonder of thy face, Until the slow West gloom to purple-grey. The daytime is my Purgatory hill, Up which I climb with halt and weary feet Until the gold of sunset streams to meet The purple of the dusk. Then stand I still And watch the fire-crown'd pinnacles, until Star-silver glimmers on the robe of night And all the wood, that hides thee from my sight, Is voiceful with the evening. Entering By the strait pathway,— where the close boughs cling Together o'er the path, as if to exclude The soiling step of any uncouth thing,— I see afar thy robe's white fluttering And hear, through all that columned solitude, The ripples of thy song's wood-silver ring. VII.THE HOUSE OF SORROW. THERE is a story, told with many a rhyme In dusty tomes of old, Of how folk sailed, in the fresh ancient time, Into the sunset's gold: Into the land of Western hope they sailed, To seek the soul of joy, That from the modern life of men had failed, Crushed by the dull annoy Of pain and toil; the gladness of the age, When Love was king on earth And summer, midmost in the winter's rage, In men's warm hearts had birth: This did they seek. Beyond the sun, they thought, Deep in the purple West, There lay the charm of joyance that they sought, Awaiting some high quest; Charm to be won by earnest souls and pure And brought anew to life; Wherewith provided, one might hope to cure Men's endless dole and strife. So, from the chains of love and toil and gold, The love of wife and maid,— All human ties had they cast loose,—unrolled The fluttering sails and weighed Swift anchor, steering tow'rd the dying day, Hope in their hearts most high That they should win the charm that therein lay For men's sake, ere to die The angel bade them. And the high heart fell Not in them, though the wind Blew fresh and swift for many a day, the swell Ran pearled the keel behind, Along the emerald, and the golden dawn Sank ever sad and pale Into the westering distance and was gone, Whenas the dew did fail; And nothing met their vision, save the streaks Of gold and crimson, wound About the westward, when the dead day's cheeks Flushed with the sun, that drowned His glory sullenly in amber foam, And the dim mists that lay Along the sapphire marges of the dome Of heaven, in the gray Of the pale dawning, and the narrowing wheel Of sea-birds round the sail And silver fish that played about the keel, With many a golden scale And fin of turquoise glancing through the spray: But never the fair line Of green and golden shores, the long array Of palaces divine, That held the dream of their long venturings, Rose in the changeful West; But still the ship sped with its silver wings Over the fretted crest Of the slow ripple; still the sea was green And calm on every side And the swift course unto their vision keen Brought but the weary wide Gray circle bounded by the silver foam; And still they looked and hoped For the fair land where the true joy had home For which they sighed and groped Amid the mirk of living. Ever pale And paler grew the skies And less refulgent in its crimson mail The hour when the day dies: And every day the dawn was tenderer And sadder in its white And rosy pudency; and still the stir Of the sad winds of night Crept closelier on the noontide, till the day Was hardly much more glad Than the pale night and morning was as gray As when the hours are sad With stormy twilight. So at last they came When, in the dreaming West, The scarlet last of sunset's fading flame Lay on the billows' breast Still climbing skyward, as it were to catch The day's last fluttering sigh— In sight of a fair city, that did match The tender amethyst sky, Pale purple with the setting. Very fair And lucent were the walls; And in the evening the enchanted hair Of some pale star, that falls From azure heights of mystery, did seem To compass it about And girdle it with glamours of a dream, Webs of desire and doubt: So that for those sweet clinging veils of mist, Amber and vaporous, One might but faintly note the amethyst And jewels of the house, That rose with many a stately battlement Out of the pulsing sea, And could but dimly trace the forms that went, Most fair and sad to see, About the silver highways and the quays Of gold and chrysoprase, Tender and tristful as the shapes one sees, In some sweet autumn haze, Flit, in the gloaming, through the enchanted air; When there is none to know, Save some pale poet, that may never dare To tell the lovely woe, The witching ecstasy of sad delight He has seen pictured there Upon the canvas of the lingering light, Under the evening air. But they that sailed in that enchanted ship, No whit cast down, drew sail And came to where the amber-polished lip Of the gold shore grew pale Under the kisses of the purpled sea: And there they landed all; And wandering inward through the blazonry Of portico and hall, They came to where the soul of sadness sat, Throned in a woman's form— Most holy and most lovely—and forgat In her sweet sight the worm Of yearning that had gnawed their hearts so long And knew at last, From her low whispers and the sad sea's song, That thither had Life past As to its goal-point: for the golden thing, That they had lacked on earth, Was not (as they had deemed) the god rose-wing Of gladness and of mirth— The god of vine-and-ivy-trellised brow And sunny orient eyes— For he doth haunt men ever, did they know But to be linnet-wise: But that best gift of the Immortal Ones, That men have lost for aye; The pure sweet sadness that we know but once, And then wepassa way: The mingled love and pain we Sorrow call, There did it dwell alone, The tender godlike pain once known to all, Now but to poets known. There sit they through the long unwearying years, At that fair lady's knees, Lulled by the ripple of her songs and tears And the sweet sighful breeze Into forgetting of the things of life And the weird shapes that fleet Across its stage of mingled dole and strife; For sorrow is so sweet, There is no gladness that may equal it Nor any charm of bliss. And fain would I from the pale seekers wit Which way the steering is That may, with helm and sail and oar pursued, Bring me where she doth dwell, The lovely lady of that solitude. Is there no one can tell? VIII.IN ARMIDA'S GARDEN. (Gluck's ‘Armide,’ Act ii. Scene 3.) (Introduction and Aria.) THIS is the land of dreams: these waving woods And the dim sunlit haze that hangs on all And the clear jewels of the murmuring stream; These flowered nooks through which the bird-notes fall, Like silver Spring-showers,—here sweet Silence broods, And here I dream. Prone in the shadow of the flowers I lie And watch the lizards glitter through the grass And listen to the tinkle of the stream: Unmindful of the weary hours that pass, Here do I lie and let the years go by: I dream and I dream. Life and the world forsake me in the calm Of these enchanted woodways, green and still, Wherein the very sunlight's wavering gleam Sleeps on the lazy ripples of the rill And in the mist of the droopt flowers' faint balm I dream and I dream. There is no future in these glades of ours Nor any whisper of the stern to-morrow; Life is a woven thing of a sunbeam: Nor in the grass is any snake of sorrow, Nor comes remorse anigh where 'mid the flowers I dream and I dream. Here are the bird-songs neither glad nor sad: Sleep drones in every note of their delight; Not even throstles with the olden theme Of tender grieving sadden the pale night; But veiled is all their song, as 'twere they had Dream within dream. Here are no roses of the sharp sweet scent Nor the sad violets' enchanted breath, Nor jasmines cluster by the slumbering stream; But the drowsed hyacinths with umbels bent And the gold-hearted lilies of sweet death, Flowers of a dream. I know not if life is with me or how I come to lie and sleep away the years: I only know, but yesterday did seem Sad life amid a swarm of sordid fears And hopes. Then came the god of Sleep—and now I dream and I dream. There swell faint breaths to me of earthly jar, As 'twere a wild-bee humming in the thyme, And the dim sounds of what pale mortals deem The aims of life come back like olden rhyme Upon mine ears, whilst, from the world afar, I dream and I dream. I hear the sweep of pinions in the air And see dim glories glitter through the skies, As if some angel from the blue extreme Of heaven strewed gold and balm of memories Upon the woods and the dim flowers that bear Spells of a dream. There hover faces o'er me oftentimes Of lovely women that I knew of old, Set like a jewel in a golden stream Of fairest locks; and from the aureoled Sweet lips there swell faint echoes of old rhymes; (I dream and I dream.) And sweet white arms enclose me as I lie, (Still do I lie and fold me in a sleep); Yea, and faint-fluttering tresses, all a-gleam, Fall down about my brow full tenderly And wind me in a glamour soft and deep. (I dream and I dream.) Yet is there nothing that therein is rife That for the world forsaken makes me sigh, More than the empty motes of a sunbeam. Unheeding them, in the dim dream I lie; Far from the flutter of the wings of Life, I dream and I dream. When wraiths of pleasure are so true and leal, Why should I seek for flesh and blood to love me? Who shall tell what things are and what things seem? I am content, unquestioning, to feel The folding of the shadow-arms above me. I dream and I dream. There are two shapes that reign in the clear air, Holding the hours with their alternate feet: Under the lindens and along the stream The twin shapes walk and make the noonday sweet With their clear songs and their aspéct most fair: (I dream and I dream) The one of them is white and lockèd with gold And the sea's blue is cloudless in his eyes; And therein comes and goes the glad sun's gleam, When in the morn the sloping shadow lies Of his fair form upon the golden wold: (I dream and I dream) But dark the other is and sad as night And his eyes purple as the evening sky, When in the midnight falls the silver beam Of the pale moon upon the flowers that lie And faint for the excess of their delight: (I dream and I dream) The fair shape's songs are joyous as the day; The other's sad as is the violets' breath; And of their lovely semblance, this I deem,— Life is the name of him that is so gay; The name men know the other by is Death. (I dream and I dream.) The fair shape holds the day for his domain And wakes the linnets with his golden song, Clear as the jewelled tinkle of the stream; The dark shape walks the cloistered night along And weaves descants of a divine sweet pain. (I dream and I dream.) But in the middle day the twain do meet, And hand in hand right lovingly they go Along the wood-ways in the noontide gleam; Mingling their songs in a sweet chant and low; And where the grass is pressed by their twin feet, I dream and I dream. Nor are these all that haunt the wooded bowers: There is another shape much sought of them, That something of the twain to have doth seem; For there is life in his sweet eyes' blue gem And death upon his tender mouth's red flowers. (I dream and I dream.) Walking alone, along the wood he goes And plucks the flowers, to breathe their scent and tell The issue of the things that he doth deem, And idles with the ripple's babbling swell, Murmuring sweet ditties that he only knows. (I dream and I dream.) Him do the twin shapes seek by hill and wood, He flying ever with an arch despite Along the meadows in the sight's extreme; And when upon the fringe of the spent night The broidery of morning is renewed, (I dream and I dream) They touch him often; yet but seldom win To make him walk with them the path beside, Along the flowered marges of the stream; And often joyous Life hath grieving sighed And Death hath sorrowing sat beside the linn, (I dream and I dream) For that he would not come: but, comes the wight, Then do they crown him, as their lord, above The twain, with laurels and an anademe Woven out of sun-gold and the moon's delight; And so I know that the fair shape is Love. (I dream and I dream.) These all are but the figures of a sleep, Being too fair for aught but the dream-world, Being too lovely to do aught but seem; And so I will to lie and them to reap: In these dim hazes of the night impearled, I dream and I dream. Come Death,—it is but night more sweet and deep; Come Life,—it is but morning come again; Come Love,—it is but the first Spring's sun-beam, With the sweet primrose-scents of rapturous pain; For Love, Life, Death, are but the terms of sleep. I dream and I dream. IX.THE WESTWARD SAILING. OH, blithe and glad the liege-folk were In all the Norway strand! For home the king a bride did bring, The king of all the land. With many a gay gold flag they decked The city of the king; Loud sang the choirs and from the spires The bells for joy did ring. There was no man in all the land But laid his grief aside, What time the king with holy ring Was wedded to his bride. Within the royal banquet-hall The bridal feast was spread; The cup went round, with garlands crowned, And eke the wine ran red. The harpers smote the silver strings, The gleemen all did sing Thereto a song so sweet and strong, That all the hall did ring. And therein sat upon his throne, Among his barons all, The king, beside his trothplight bride, And ruled the festival. He kissed his bride, his bride kissed him, From the same cup drank they; And therewithal the minstrels all Did sing a joyous lay. Oh, merry, merry went the feast And fast the red wine ran! The gates gaped wide and in did stride An old seafaring man. In russet leather was he clad, As those that use the sea, And three times rolled, a chain of gold About his neck had he. Gray was his head, his beard was gray And furrowed was his brow; But in his eye a might did lie That made all heads to bow. He gazed upon the crownèd king, Upon his barons all; And there befell a sudden spell Of silence in the hall. With steel-gray eyes he gazed on them, Whilst none the hush might break,— The words to come were stricken dumb,— And thus to them he spake: “The lift is clear, the wind blows free Toward the sunset land; Oh, who with me will sail the sea Unto the Western strand? “Now let the courtier leave his feast And plough the deep with me! The king his bride let leave, to ride Over the briny sea! “Now let the baron leave his hall, The minstrel leave his song! For in the West is set the quest Whereafter all men long. “There are the forests thick with flower And there the winds breathe balm And there gold birds sing wonder-words Under the summer calm. “There is the earth thick-strewn with gems, The sands are golden-shelled And in the skies the magic lies That gives new youth to eld. “Oh, who will sail the seas with me Unto the shores of gold? There lieth rest, that is the best For all men, young or old.” Then up there leapt the crownèd king, The king of all the land: “Oh, I with thee will sail the sea Unto the Western strand! “Whate'er thou art, thy words have wrought Such yearning in my breast, That I will sail, come weal or bale, Unto the golden West!” His bride hath laid upon his arm Her hand more white than snow; She kissed him thrice, with tearful eyes And mouth all white for woe; And on his finger, for a sign That he should ne'er forget, A ring threefold of good red gold And sapphires hath she set. The seaman led them with his eye Out of the high gold door; And they are come, for wonder dumb, Down to the white sea-shore. Before the city, on the sea, A fair tall ship there lay, With sails of silk as white as milk And ropes of seagreen say. Into the vessel tall and stout He brought them every one; And as he bade, all sail they made Toward the setting sun. Oh, many a weary day they sailed Across the silver spray! And ever due the West wind blew, But never land saw they: A wild wide waste of emerald sea, Flecked with the argent foam; A sun of gold that westward rolled Over the blue sky-dome; The twilight gray, that ends the day, And then the moon on high; The purple night, with moonlight white And stars thick set in sky. So fifty days were wellnigh past, And on the fiftieth day, At eventide, the sad wind sighed, The sapphire lift grew gray. The icebergs rose about the ship, All in a death-white ring, And grimly round with ice they bound The vessel of the king. The helmsman stood beside the helm; The flesh from off him fell; And in his stead there reared its head A grisly Death from Hell. The Death-King stood upon the deck, High as the topmost mast, And thrice among that pallid throng He blew a deathly blast. With the first breath the sky turned black, The sun a red fire grew, And ghastly pale, the hearts did fail Of all that luckless crew. A second time he breathed on them Under the heavens' pall, And with his breath the sleep of death Fell down upon them all. A third time with his mouth he blew— His mouth without a lip— And far below the chill tide-flow Down sank the doomèd ship. Deep in the bosom of the sea The frozen Norsemen rest; Each mother's son the prize hath won That for all men is best. All in the trance of that strange sleep, Upon the deck they stand; And Death the King, he hath the ring Upon his bony hand. X.SIR ERWIN'S QUESTING. ‘OH, whither, whither ridest thou, Sir Erwin? The glitter of the dawn is in the sky; And I hear the laverock singing, Where the silken corn is springing And the green-and-gold of summer's on the rye.’ ‘O lady fair, I ride toward the setting; For the glamour of the West is on my heart And I hear a dream-voice calling To the land where dews are falling And the blossoms of the Springtide ne'er depart.’ ‘Oh, what, oh, what thing seekest thou, Sir Erwin? Is life no longer pleasant to thy soul? Am I no more heart's dearest, Though the summer skies are clearest And the gold of June is fresh on copse and knoll?’ ‘O sweet, I seek the land where love is holy And the bloom of youth is ever on the flowers; The land where joy is painless And the eyes' delight is stainless And the break of hope faints never in the weary noontide hours.’ ‘Oh, rest awhile, oh, rest awhile, Sir Erwin! The hills are yet ungilded by the sun. Oh, tarry till the morning Have chased the mists of dawning And the weariness of noon be past and done!’ ‘O lady fair, I may not tarry longer! The sun is climbing fast above the grey And I hear the trumpets blowing, Where the eastern clouds are glowing And the mists of night are breaking from the city of the day.’ Far out into the greenwood rides Sir Erwin, Oh, far into the wild wood rideth he! And there meet him sisters seven, When the sun is high in heaven And the gold of noon is bright on flower and tree. Oh, wonder-lovely maidens were the seven, With mantles of the crimson and the green, With red-gold rings and girdles And sea-blue shoes and kirtles And eyes that shone like cornflowers in their locks' corn-golden sheen. ‘Oh, light thee down and dwell with us, heart's dearest! And we will sing thee wonder-lovely songs And we will strew with roses The place where thy repose is And teach thee all the rapture that unto love belongs. ‘Oh, light thee down and dwell with us, heart's dearest! We have full many a secret of delight: Thy day shall be one sweetness Of love in its completeness And the nightingale shall sing to thee the whole enchanted night.’ ‘Oh, woe is me! I may not stay, fair maidens; My quest is for a country far and wild; The land where springs the Iris, There is a legend that the more distant-seeming end of the rainbow begins in Fairyland. Where the end of all desire is And the thought of love lives ever undefiled.’ ‘Oh, light thee down and dwell with us, heart's dearest! Thou wilt wear thy youth to eld in such a quest: For it lies beyond the setting, In the land of the Forgetting, In the bosom of the everlasting rest!’ Far on into the greenwood rides Sir Erwin, Oh, far into the wild wood rideth he! And he sees a fair wife sitting, At the hour when light is flitting And the gold of sunset gathers on the sea. Oh, very fair and stately was her seeming And very sweet and dreamful were her eyes! And as she sat a-weaving, She sang a song of grieving, Full low and sweet to anguish, mixt with sighs. ‘Oh, tell me what thou weavest there, fair lady, I prithee tell me quickly what thou art!’ ‘I am more fair than seeming And I weave the webs of dreaming, For the solace of the world-awearied heart.’ ‘Oh, prithee tell me, tell to me, fair lady, What song is that thou singest and so sweet?’ ‘I sing the songs of sorrow, That is golden on the morrow, And I charm with them the sad hours' leaden feet. ‘Oh, light thee down and dwell with me, heart's dearest! Thou hast wandered till thy face is furrowed deep; But I will charm earth's cumbers From the rose-meads of thy slumbers And will fold thee in the lotus-leaves of sleep.’ ‘Oh, woe is me! oh, woe is me, fair lady! A hand of magic draws me on my quest Toward the land of story, Where glows the sunset-glory And the light of love fades never from the West.’ ‘Oh, light thee down and dwell with me, heart's dearest! Thine eyes will lose their lustre by the way; For it lies far out to yonder, Where the setting sun dips under And the funeral pyres are burning for the day.’ Oh, far thorough the greenwood rides Sir Erwin, Oh, far out of the wild wood rideth he! And he comes where waves are plashing And the wild white crests are dashing On the pebbles of a gray and stormy sea. Far down toward the tide-flow rides Sir Erwin, Oh, far adown the shingle rideth he! And he sees a shallop rocking Upon the wild waves' flocking, And an ancient steersman sitting in the lee. Oh, very weird and gruesome was that steersman, With hair that mocked for white the driven snow! The light of some strange madness Was in his eyes' gray sadness And he showed like some pale ghost of long ago. ‘Oh, sail with me! oh, sail with me, Sir Erwin! Thou hast wandered in thy questing far enough. I will bring thee where Love's ease is For ever, though the breezes Blow rudely and the broad green way be rough.’ ‘Reach hand to me, reach hand to me, old steersman! I will sail with thee for questing o'er the main. Although thine eyes look coldly, I will dare the venture boldly; For I weary for an ending of my pain.’ Oh, long they rode on billows, in the glory Of the gold and crimson standards of the West! So came they, in the setting, To the land of the Forgetting, Where the weary and the woeful are at rest. ‘Oh, what can be this land that is so peaceful, That lies beyond the setting of the sun? I hear a dream-bell ringing And I hear a strange sweet singing And the tender gold of twilight's on the dun. ‘Oh, what are these fair forms that float toward me And what are these that hold me by the hand, As if they long had sought me? And what art thou hast brought me O'er the ocean to this dream-enchanted strand?’ ‘Fair knight, this is the land of the Hereafter And the name that men do know me by is Death: For the love, from life that's flying, Lives ever for the dying And the stains of it are purged with 'scape of breath.’ XI.THE BALLAD OF SHAMEFUL DEATH. ‘Le regard calme et haut, Qui damne tout un peuple autour d'un échafaud.’ Baudelaire. I GO to an evil death, to lie in a shameful grave, And I know there is never a hope and never a God that can save; Yet I smile, for I know that the end of my toil and my striving is come; I shall sleep in the bosom of death, where the voice of the scorners is dumb. I go in the felons' cart, with my hands bound fast with the cord And nothing of brave or bright in the death that I ride toward: The people clamour and jeer, with a fierce and an evil glee, And the mothers and maids that pass do shudder to look on me. For the deed that I did for men, the life that I crown with death, Was a crime in the sight of all, a flame of the pestwind's breath; And the good and the gentle pass with a sad and a drooping head, As I go to my punished crime, to lie with the felon dead. But lo! I am joyful and proud, as one that is newly crowned: I heed not the gibes and the sneers and the hates that compass me round; I come not, with drooping head, to the death that a felon dies; I come as a king to the feast, with a deathless light in mine eyes. I ride with a dream in mine eyes and the sound of a dream in mine ears And my spirit wanders again in the lapse of the bygone years; I smile with the bygone hope and I weep for the bygone grief And I weave me the olden plans for the world's and the folk's relief. I build me over again the time of my yearning youth, When my heart was sick for men's grief and my gladness failed me for ruth; For I saw that their lives were weary and maddened with bitter toil And there came no helper to heal, no prophet to purge the soil. I mind me how all the joys, a man in his manhood's prime May have in the new sweet world and the strength of his blossom-time, Were saddened and turned to gall by the cry of the world's lament, That withered the roses' bloom and poisoned the violets' scent. My heart is full of the thoughts that gathered within my soul And the anguish that held my life at the sight of my fellows' dole; I mind me how, day by day, the passion grew in my breast, The voices cried in my sleep and hindered my heart of rest. It rises before me now, in its fragrance ever the same, The time when my soul found peace and my yearning soared like a flame, The day when my shapeless thought took spirit and speech and form, The hour when I swore alone to front the fire and the storm. It rises before me now, the little lane by the wood, With the golden-harvested fields, where the corn in its armies stood, The berries brown in the hedge, the eddying leaves in the breeze And the spirits that seemed to speak in the wind that sighed through the trees. The path where I went alone, in the midst of the swaying sheaves, Through the landscape glowing with gold and crimson of Autumn leaves; The place where my full resolve rose out of my tears and sighs, Where my life was builded for me and my way lay clear in mine eyes. I mind me the words I spoke, the deeds that I did to save, The life that I lived to rescue the world from its living grave; I mind me the blows I smote at the thronèd falsehood and blame, The comfort I spoke for the lost, the love that I gave to shame. I mind me of all the hates that gathered about my strife, The gibes that poisoned my speech, the lies that blackened my life, The fears that maddened the folk, the folly that shrank with dread From the love I spoke for the live, the hope I held for the dead. For the folk, with their purblind souls, chose rather to live and die In the olden anguishful slough, to weary and groan and sigh In the old familiar toil and the old unvarying hate, Than rise to a joy unknown, a love to free them from Fate. And the words that I spoke for love, the deeds that I did for hope, The future I showed for life in the new sweet credence's scope, They deemed them a tempting of hell, a blasphemy and a crime; They thought the angel a fiend, that called them out of their slime. The yearning that cried in their breasts, that met mine own like a flood, They thought to quench it with fire, to stay its passion with blood, To deaden my voice with death, (their own should be silent then;) And so I come to atone for the love that I bore to men. My enemies laugh in their glee, as the people jeer at my fate; They know not the seed of love that lies at the heart of hate: They give me hatred for love and death for the life I brought; But I smile, for I know that love shall come at the last, unsought. I look far on in the years and see the blood that I shed Crying a cry in men's ears, crying the cry of the dead; I see my thought and my hope fulfilling my work for men In the folk that jeer at me now, the lips that spat at me then. I know that for many a year my life shall be veiled with shame, That many an age shall hate me and make a mock of my name; I know that the fathers shall teach their children many a year To hold my hope for a dread and know my creed for a fear. But I know that my work shall grow in the darkness ever the same; Its seed shall stir in the earth in the shade of my evil fame; My thought shall conquer and live, when the sound of my doom is fled And my name and my crime are buried, to lie with the unknown dead. Wherefore I smile as I go and the joy at my heart is strong And I gaze with a peace and a hope on the cruel glee of the throng; I live in my thought and my love, I conquer Time with my faith And I ride with a deathless hope to crown my living with death. I loved thee, beautiful Death, in the fresh sweet time of the Spring, And I will not fail from my troth in the wind of the axe's swing; I come to thy bridal bed, O Death my belovéd, I come! I shall sleep in thine arms at the last, when the voice of the scoffers is dumb. O friends that are faithful yet, if your love shall bear me in mind With a graven stone on the tomb where I sleep with my felon kind, Write me as one that fell in the way of a punished crime, ‘Hated of men he died, in the heart of the evil time!’ And yet I would not be thought to glose o'er my full stern fate Or leave weak words of complaint for the ages that lie in wait. Rase out the final words; I will rest with the first content; ‘Hated of men he died’ shall stand for my monument. I was never in love with the praise nor afraid of the censure of fools: Mean they as well as they may, they were ever the dastard's tools. Strike out the words of complaint; I will stand by the rest alone: ‘Hated of men’ shall pass for the roll of my virtues on stone. And yonder on in the years, some few of the wise, perad-venture, Shall read in the things laid bare the truth of my lifelong venture, Shall see my life like a star in the shrouding mists of the ages And set my name for a light and a patriot's name in their pages. And then shall the clearer sight and the tenderer thought fulfil The things that I left unsaid, the words that are lacking still: A poet shall set my name in the gold of his noble rhyme; ‘Hated of men he died, in the heart of the evil time.’ XII.THE BALLAD OF THE KING'S DAUGHTER. I. THE still earth sleeps in the Summer night, The air is full of the moon; All over the land, in her silver sight, The roses blossom, ruddy and white; The world is joyous with June. There goes a moan in the greenwood hoar, A moan, but and a wail: What sighing is that the breezes bore? What plaining is that which shrilleth o'er The note of the nightingale? A green glade lies in the middle wood: Under the moonlight pale, The greensward glitters many a rood. Who lies on the grass, bedabbled with blood? A knight in his silver mail. A murdered knight on the greensward lies, Under the witch-white moon: The air is thick with his dying sighs; The nightbirds flutter about his eyes; The corbies over him croon. II. The night-wind wails, The moon-silver pales, The stars are faint in the mist; The king's daughter rides over hill and dale, Under the arch of the pine-shade pale, A lily of gold in the moon-mist's veil. And as she rides Where the mill-stream glides, A raven is sitting on the tree by the brown water, With ‘Woe to thee! oh, woe to thee, king's daughter! Thou ridest to an evil tryst.’ The silence quivers, The pine-shade shivers, Sad flute-notes wake in the gloom. The king's daughter rides in the hawthorn track; Gold is her hair on the black steed's back. Whose steps are those That the echo throws Back on the startled ear of the night? What form is that in the moonlight white That follows the track of her horse's feet? Whose hands on the red-gold bridle meet? Whose spells are they that such scath have wrought her, That the night-winds cry to her, ‘Woe, king's daughter! Thou ridest to thy place of doom.’ The moon brims up In her pearlèd cup, The air grows purple as gore; The stars are red With blood to be shed; The king's daughter sees in the purple sky The wings of the birds of ill omen fly, And the broidered lights in the cloud-rack burn With a word that is weary and fierce and stern; The shadows of the night in their arms have caught her And the night-winds cry to her, ‘Woe, king's daughter! Thy pleasant place of life shall never know thee more.’ Out of the maze Of the woodbind ways, Into a moonlit glade, The maiden rides, with the shape of gloom Casting a shade on her cheek's rose-bloom, A shadow of surely hastening doom. What glitter is that of silvered mail, Prone on the grass in the moonlight pale? A sword-hilt joined to a broken blade: Whose blood is red on the bright brown steel? Who lies in the sleep of death? It is her knight, that was true and leal, Whose lips so often her lips have kissed, To whom the shades of the night have brought her; And she hears in the echo his dying breath: ‘Ah! woe is me for thee, king's daughter! Thou comest to a woful tryst.’ III. She hath alighted from off her steed And she hath raised her lover's head And laid it on her knees; The rose of her heart begins to bleed And on her breast his blood is red; Her heart begins to freeze. She hath arisen from off the ground And she hath ta'en the bloodied blade And dug with it a grave; She hath diggèd a grave both deep and round And there his body hath she laid: His soul the dear Christ save! She hath folded her round her mantle gray And she hath stepped into the tomb And laid her by his side: The dead and the live, the knight and his may, They are wedded at last in night and gloom: The grave is fair and wide. IV. The day-flower blows on the eastern hills. (Woe is me for the king's daughter!) The throstle in the morn Sings blithely on the thorn And golden is the sun on the grave of the king's daughter. The wind of dawn through the forest shrills, With leaves for the grave of the king's daughter. A lily of red gold Its flower-flames doth unfold And glisters in the sun from the heart of the king's daughter. XIII.THE ROSES OF SOLOMON. SOLOMON of ancient story Of the Lord had roses seven, Roses of the morning-glory, Dropping with the dews of heaven. Angels plucked them in the garden Of the city high and golden, Ere the dews had time to harden, That within their cups were holden, Into jewels for the adorning Of the Cherubim immortal, Of the Chamberlains of Morning, Of the Seraphs of the Portal. Flowers from a celestial far land, With the breath of blessing o'er them, Woven, gathered in a garland, Still for benison he bore them. From the chrysoberyl ceiling Of his chair of state suspended, All the air with fragrance filling, Bright with blossom never ended, Hung the heaven-descended flowers, Each its proper boon of blessing, Each its own enchanted powers By the grace of God possessing. Kingship this and domination Gave of all the worldly spaces, Over every land and nation, Over all the tribes and races. That the dark world's sons and daughters Bent to, spirits earthy, airy, Angels of the fires and waters, Demon, seraph, afrit, fairy. Empire this which never dieth Gave o'er all with life and motion, All that creepeth, fareth, flieth In the earth and air and ocean. That command of all the courses Gave of land and sea and heaven, Winds and waters, flames and forces, Sun and moon and planets seven. This o'er soulless things had power, All that sees not, speaks not, hears not, Stone and metal, herb and flower, Everything that stands and stirs not. That continuance eternal Gave and life that never faded, Youth renewing, sempervernal, Age and death fore'er evaded. Sapience the last celestial Gave and power all hearts of reading, Wit t solve all doubts terrestrial, Wisdom for all worldly needing. With these talismans provided, Angel-armied, Naiad-navied, Wisdom-warranted, God-guided, Who was like the son of David? All his nights with love he meted, All his days with war and kingcraft, On the breezes fared and fleeted, From the birds caught song- and wingcraft; Moulded Israel to his measure, Swayed all Syria, lowlands, highlands, Swept the Indian seas for treasure, Levied tribute from the islands; Filled earth's faces with his armies, With his navies oared the ocean; Made Judæa, vi et armis, Laughing as the land of Goshen; Ceiled his palaces with cedar, Garnered pearls and gems for money, Dan to Gilead, Gath to Kedar, Made the realm run milk and honey. Never monarch was that flourished As did he: with power and praises Fed to fulness, pleasure-nourished, Glorious in all men's gazes, In Jerusalem high-builded, Over all the land prevailing, Mid his graven halls and gilded, Lapt in love and fame unfailing, Life on his commandments waiting, All its rocky places levelled, Nothing lacking, nothing bating, Many a year he reigned and revelled: Till at last, with sweetness sated, Tired of thrones and dominations, Turned he to the things God hated, Followed on abominations; Worshipped Ishtar, Moloch, Tanit, Sought Canopus and Orion, Bowed to stock and stone and planet, Quite forgot the God of Zion. Then did Jahveh rise and blast him, Beggared him of gifts and graces, From his chair of kingship cast him, Throned an afrit in his places. Virtue all forsook the roses; Withered weeds, from heaven banished, For the Paradisal closes Languishing, they pined and vanished. What of David's son remained is? All his greatness, all his glory, How he revelled, how he reigned, is Nothing now but idle story. XIV.THE BALLAD OF MAY MARGARET. OH, sweet is the Spring in coppice and wold And the bonny fresh flowers are springing! May Margaret walks in the merry greenwood, To hear the blithe birds singing. May Margaret walks in the heart of the treen, Under the green boughs straying; And she hath met the king of the elves, Under the lindens playing. ‘Oh, wed thou with me, May Margaret, All in the merry green Maytime, And thou shalt dance all the moonlit night And sleep on flowers in the daytime!’ ‘O king of the elves, it may not be, For the sake of the folk that love me; I may not be queen of the elfland green, For the fear of the heaven above me.’ ‘Oh, an thou wilt be the elfland's queen, Thy robe shall be blue and golden And thou shalt drink of the rose-red wine, In blue-bell chalices holden.’ ‘O king of the elves, it may not be. My father at home would miss me; An if I were queen of the elfland green, My mother would never kiss me.’ ‘Oh, an thou wilt be the elfland's queen, Thy shoon shall be seagreen sendal; Thy thread shall be silk as white as milk And snow-white silver thy spindle.’ He hath led her by the lilywhite hand Into the hillside palace: And he hath given her wine to drink Out of the blue-bell chalice. Now seven long years are over and gone, Since the thorn began to blossom; And she hath brought the elf-king a son And beareth it on her bosom. ‘A boon, a boon, my husband the king, For the sake of my babe I cry thee!’ ‘Now ask what thou wilt, May Margaret; There's nothing I may deny thee.’ ‘Oh, let me go home for a night and a day, To show my mother her daughter And fetch a priest to my bonny wee babe, To sprinkle the holy water! ‘Oh, let me go home for a day and a night To the little town by the river! And we will turn to the merry greenwood And dwell with the elves for ever.’ Oh, out of the elfland are they gone, Mother and babe together, And they are come, in the blithe Springtime, To the land of the blowing heather. ‘Oh, where is my mother I used to kiss And my father that erst caressed me? They both lie cold in the churchyard mould And I have no whither to rest me. ‘Oh, where is the dove that I used to love And the lover that used to love me? The one is dead, the other is fled; But the heaven is left above me. ‘I pray thee, sir priest, to christen my babe With bell and candle and psalter; And I will give up this bonny gold cup, To stand on the holy altar.’ ‘O queen of the elves, it may not be! The elf must suffer damnation, But if thou wilt bring thy costliest thing, As guerdon for its salvation.’ ‘Oh, surely my life is my costliest thing! I give it and never rue it. An if thou wilt save my innocent babe, The blood of my heart ensue it!’ The priest hath made the sign of the cross, The white-robed choristers sing; But the babe is dead ere blessing be said, May Margaret's costliest thing. Oh, drearly and loud she shrieked, as if The soul from her breast should sever! And she hath gone to the merry greenwood, To dwell with the elves for ever. XV.THE MARSH-KING'S DAUGHTER. I. A WIND came over the Western water, (Oh sweet is the rose in the fresh Spring-time!) ‘Weary of life,’ it said, ‘poor lover? Sick for a love that is dead and gone? (Winds blow over her, earth's above her.) Sick for a day that was faded at dawn? The cure is the kiss of the marsh-king's daughter.’ Weary of life, I answered and said, ‘O wind of the Western water!’ Sick for a day and a love that are dead, ‘Why should I seek,’ I answered and said, ‘The kiss of the marsh-king's daughter?’ II. The wind came over the Western water: (The death-flower blows in the Summer's prime!) ‘If one be weary and sick of living, Sick for the sake of a vanished love, Sick of the glow and blossom of Spring, Sick of the Summer's glitter and ring; If colour lack in the Autumn's weaving And the Winter hold not sorrow enough, The cure is the kiss of the marsh-king's daughter.’ Weary of life, I answered and said, ‘O wind of the Western water!’ Bitter with tears that I could not shed, ‘Tell me, West-wind,’ I answered and said, ‘The home of the marsh-king's daughter.’ III. ‘It lies far over the Western water. (Oh sweet is the rose in the fresh Spring-time!) Under the arch of the sun at setting, ‘Twixt gold of sunset and dusk of night, Under the sound of the sea-winds' fretting; In the purple heart of the marish mist, That the shafts of the dying day have kiss'd, Under the ceiling where stars are bright, There is the home of the marsh-king's daughter.’ Weary of life, I answered and said, ‘O wind of the Western water! My hopes lie close in the house of the dead; But I will go,’ I answered and said, ‘To seek for the marsh-king's daughter.’ IV. I wandered over the Western water, (Oh sweet is the rose in the fresh Spring-time!) And I came in the evening, when light was dying, To a land where the hum of the world was still, Where the voice of the evening wind was sighing And the spells of sleep were over the air; And I saw in the setting the golden hair Of the sunset broider the mists, until They grew to the robe of the marsh-king's daughter. Golden starlets were over her head, (A crown for the marsh-king's daughter.) ‘Come to my arms,’ I answered and said; And she came, with the West-wind's murmurous tread, To me that so long had sought her. V. A voice came over the Western water: (The deathflower blows in the Summer's prime!) ‘Dearly,’ it said, ‘hast thou won and bought her. Her kisses are cold as are the dead And the gold of her hair o'er thee is shed, As wings of the birds that fly to the slaughter! The lips thou shouldst kiss are living and red, Thine eyes should feast on the joys of earth, Thy hands pluck flowers in the golden prime. Youth was not made for sorrow and dearth: Get thee back, whilst there yet is time; For Death is the name of the marsh-king's daughter!’ Weary of life, I answered and said, ‘O wind of the Western water! My lips shall kiss but the lips of the dead.’ Sick of the day, I answered and said, ‘Kiss me, O marsh-king's daughter!’ SONNETS. INTROIT. THIS is the House of Dreams. Whoso is fain To enter in this shadow-land of mine, He must forget the utter Summer's shine And all the daylight ways of hand and brain: Here is the white moon ever on the wane And here the air is sad with many a sign Of haunting myst'ries; here the golden wine Of June falls never nor the silver rain Of hawthorns hueless with the joy of Spring; But many a mirage of pale memories Curtains the sunless aisles: upon the breeze A music of waste sighs doth float and sing And in the shadow of the sad-flowered trees, The ghosts of men's desire walk wandering. AD DANTEM. TO thee, my master, thee, my shining one, Whose solitary face, immovable, Burning athwart the midmost glooms of Hell, Calls up stern shadows of the things undone,— To thee, immortal, shining like the sun In the blue heart of Heaven's clearest bell, Circled with radiances ineffable,— These pale sad flowers I bring,—how hardly won From this grey night of modern lovelessness, How hardly and how wearily God knows! These at thy feet I lay, whose hues confess Thy mighty shade, so haply they may shine With some pale reflex of that light divine Which ripples round thine own supernal rose. TROPIC FLOWER. AS I went walking in the air one day— Sadly enough—a thought laid hold on me With flower-soft hands and would not set me free. It was, meseemed, as if a rose of May Blew suddenly against a wintry way Of snow and barren boughs; for I could see No cause why such a lovely light should be In my dull soul, nor how my heart's dismay Should have lent life to any pleasant thing. But, with remembering, presently I knew That this was but the scarlet flowering Of some most bitter aloe-root that grew In my sick soul an hundred years and drew All my lost summers to its single Spring. HAUNTED LIFE. HOW shall I 'scape the presence of this death? Sleeping, the Dream-God folds me in his wings; And with the grey pale day comes Thought and brings With him the sad enchantments of the breath Of some dumb ghost-world that envelopeth My narrow life with many-woven rings Of imminent mystery. The viewless things Are thick and tyrannous on me, a sheath Of unseen mists, that prison up my hands. The wraiths of things long dead and things undone, Memories and forecasts, lives that yet shall be Or might be compassed, with such strangling bands They bind me, that this world beneath the sun Fails from my grasp and life is death to me. HESPERIA. MY dream is of a city in the West, Built with fair colours, still and sad as flowers That wear the blazon of the autumn hours, Set by the side of some wide wave's unrest; And there the sun-filled calm is unimprest, Save by a flutter as of silver showers, Rain-rippled on dim Paradisal bowers, And some far tune of bells chimed softliest. About the still clear streets my love-thoughts go, A many-coloured throng, some pale as pearl, Some bright as the gold brow-locks of a girl: And midst them, where the saddest memories teem, My veiled hope wanders, musingly and slow, And hears the sad sea murmur like a dream. WINTER ROSES. I SOUGHT thee when the world was full of flower, O wide-winged love! and seeking, found thee not. In vain the linnets sang, the lilies got Them robes of silver and the roses' shower Of blossom tapestried each fragrant hour; The skies were idly blue; the glad heats wrought Their summer sorcery of flowers for nought; The autumn brought the bridal year its dower Of jewelled fruits and sunlight-coloured corn. But for my part I took no heed of them, Wandering, grave-eyed, along the meadows' hem, Following my dream, unfriended and apart, Sad in the noon-day, joyless in the morn, Mirroring all things in my empty heart. And as I went and communed with my pain, Unknowing all the glories of the day And all the radiance of the stars' array For lack of love, the hope began to wane Within my breast and to myself, “In vain, In vain, sad soul,” I said, “thou dost essay The weary path of years and Life's waste way Of lengthening memories! If Love were fain To turn his wings to thee-ward and to tread Thy way with equal feet, he would forego His fair intent, seeing thy stern wan face And thy sad eyes that fill the fields with woe, And marvel in himself how one should trace Life's path with feet that linger for the dead.” Lo! for I said, Love loveth allegresse And fair wise joyance in all pleasant things: It likes him not that in the waverings Of saddened fancy one should seek to press His grapes of heaven, that in the loneliness Of deathward thought a man should bind his wings And prison all his rare sweet wanderings Within a labyrinth of deep duresse, Hoarding his wine up in strange poison-flowers And sucking bitters from his passionate sweets. Lo! for Love walketh in the pleasant hours Of life and passeth by the lonely seats Of delicate sadness, where the veilèd powers Do weave strange dreams, far from the noontide heats. And yet, methinks, I had made sacrifice To pleasant Love with many a faint sweet thing, Done homage to him with much flowering Of tender dreams and many a rare device Of songs, half sad, half joyous, to suffice For such rude pastoral rounds as shepherds sing, When the winged arrow bites them. Offering Of many flowers of night and many a spice Of tropic forests, darkening to their deep Of delicate shade for horror of the sun, I would have made him: all the flowers that sleep Within the wilder solitudes of thought, All faint-hued fancies that the day do shun, Loving, to thee, O Love! these had I brought. Methinks thou didst not well my prayers to scorn, O tyrant Love, that never pardoneth! I with my songs the victor over Death Had laurelled thee; and all the shades forlorn Should for thine hour of triumphing have worn Thy hues of noon; and eke thy linnets' breath Should have rung resonant—as one that saith, ‘The dim night passeth: welcome in the morn!’ —Athwart the woods and fastnesses of grief. Now dost thou wear for crownal flowers of day, Glad myrtles and the passionate-petalled rose: Me serving, I had crowned thee with a sheaf Of lilies silver with their blanching woes And violets dropping with the tears of May. Thus with myself devising, did I pass Along the summer meadows and the woods Aflame with autumn's many-blazoned moods: And now the rime did jewel all the grass And on the plains the silver snows did mass Within the hollows. Over all the floods The winter brooded, as a spell-work broods, And the ice-sleep compelled the river's glass. Then did my heart take comfort from the time: The dim white woodlands held more hope for me Within the cloisters of their leafless aisles Than all the summer's gold; the speechless rime Was grateful to me and the pale sky's smiles Stirred all my wintry soul to harmony. Then, as I strayed among the silent ways, Much comforted from all my old despite, Love came to me across that world of white, With drooping wings and winter-saddened gaze; And as I looked on him with still amaze, He took my hand within his palms of light And with full many a promise of delight, Prevailed on me that I should work his praise. But I, “My heart has all forgot the songs Of summer and the full-toned autumn-lays: I have no memory of the jewelled throngs, That blew for thee about the August ways: My soul is dumb with winter. Let me rest: Love has no empery in this sad breast.” Nay, (but he said,) the summer's songs are sweet, When June is golden; and the autumn's tide Befits full harmonies. Whilst these abide, The songs of joyance gracious are and meet: But when the winter comes, with silver feet A-walking in the snows, one lays aside The passionate descants that glorified The goodlier hours; and then the heart doth greet, With doubled ease, the tender plaining notes Of shy and suffering souls, that have in vain Sought flying favour in the joy that floats About the summer; and the altar-flame Of love burns brightlier for their offered pain Who spared to love, until life's winter came. So he with softest words prevailed on me: And I, with heart half-glad, half-wearying, Did at his hest address myself to sing, Holding his hand as link of fealty. Singing of all the strange delights that be In sad sweet musing and the illumining That Love doth pour upon each sombre thing, Among the dreaming trees I went. And he The while retraced my visions in the air, Colouring my dreams with all his magic light And murmuring o'er the songs that I did sing, With a new added accent of delight. So, hand in hand, along the woodways bare We went, nor wearied for the tardy Spring. DORIC MODE. SEEK, then, no more to sweep the unwilling strings To tempest nor to harrow up the skies With the void passion of Titanic sighs; Thou shalt not scale the heaven on thunderous wings Of resonant prayer. The terror of sweet things Mounts up, sure-winged, to where the whirlwind dies, Unechoed; and the eternal harmonies Are stirred more surely, when the poet sings Bird-softly, bent above the low-voiced lute. Thunders lie low; the middle air is mute To their reverberance; but, when there rings Through heaven the cadence of the Dorian flute, The great gods hearken from their sojournings And life flowers forth with immemorial Springs. THE GARDEN OF ADONIS. (Spenser's Faery Queene. The Legend of Britomart, vi, 29.) THERE lies a garden in the westward hills, Compassed about with walls of mystery And girt with an inviolable sea Of silentness; and there no linnet trills: But, in the witchery of peace that fills The voiceless lawns, sleep unawakeningly The sweet lost dreams, that there englamoured be And may not pass those thrice-enchanted sills. There have I laid my wounded love to sleep And heal its dole among the unstirred dells; And thence, methinks, when many a gradual sweep Of years has purged life's passion in the wells Of restfulness, my soul its flower shall reap, Made whole and fair with many mystic spells. SOVRAN SORROW. DEATH came to me and took me by the hand, What time the earth had girt her first with Spring And all the meadows put on blossoming. “Come forth,” said he, “and see my flowers expand:” And forth we passed into the pleasant land. And as we went, the small birds all did sing And all the flowers praised Death in everything. Then, as I looked, amazed, to see the brand And sign of that his dreadful sovranty, Behold, a crown of holiest sorrowing Flamed on the angel's brow; and unto me, Knee-bent for reverence, these words did ring Most softly, “Lo! he ruleth all that be, Seeing he sorrows more than anything.” FRANCOIS RABELAIS. MASTER, whose glad face lightens through the years, Awful and fair with laughter against wrong, We that have loved thee loyally and long, Laid heart to thine with laughter and with tears, Glorying to see thee with thy golden spears Smite through, Apollo-like, the Python-throng Of woes, and no less pitiful than strong, Salve with thy smile the dolours and the fears, Fain would we have thy presence once again, In these our tragic times of doubt and stress, To purge the air with ridicule; ay, fain Would we behold, athwart the mist that seals Our toil-gray skies, thy brow's strong sunniness, The visage of a god that laughs and heals. EVOCATION. METHINKS in some far sunset-coloured place Of dreams and flowers, the stress of my desire Must have grown up to flowerage of fire And snow in a fair maiden's dream-filled face And pearly limbs, washed round with all the grace Of Spring-tide thought; a lady like a lyre For the harmonious waftings that aspire From all things amorous of her being's trace. I picture her to me,—my love of dreams,— Pacing the gold shore of that magic land, Pensive and fair with many a half-filled thought; And to each pulse of my strained soul, meseems, Her essence answers, as to wafts wind-brought Of charms cast out from some far wizard's hand. How many times, sweetheart, how many times I have made running rivers of my sighs, Poured out my yearning into melodies Of love, that on the torrent of my rhymes My thought might voyage to those golden climes Of mystery, jewelled o'er with sapphire skies, Where thy feet walk and make life Paradise! And unto thee, mayhap, as 'twere the chimes Of some far dream-bell fluttering the air, The echo of my great desire has won, Like to a sigh of spirits far away; And thou, with some still sadness filled and fair, Hast for a dream-space stood and watched the sun And the clear colours fading from the day. ROCOCO. STRAIGHT and swift the swallows fly To the sojourn of the sun; All the golden year is done, All the flower-time flitted by; Through the boughs the witch-winds sigh: But heart's summer is begun; Life and love at last are one; Love-lights glitter in the sky. Summer-days were soon outrun, With the setting of the sun; Love's delight is never done. Let the turn-coat roses die; We are lovers, Love and I: In Love's lips my roses lie. LIFE UNLIVED. HOW many months, how many a weary year My soul had stood upon that brink of days, Straining dim eyes into the treacherous haze For signs of life's beginning. Far and near The grey mist floated, like a shadow-mere, Beyond hope's bounds; and in the lapsing ways, Pale phantoms flitted, seeming to my gaze The portents of the coming hope and fear. “Surely,” I said, “life shall rise up at last, Shall sweep me by with pageant and delight!” But, as I spoke, the waste shook with a blast Of cries and clamours of a mighty fight; Then all was still. Upon me fell the night And a voice whispered to me, “Life is past.” BELPHOEBE. (Spenser's Faery Queene, Book III. Cantos v. and vi.) SHE may not give thee love nor any hate: Her life is calm and senseless as the flowers That fall around her in such scented showers: Snow-calm, she standeth in the present's gate, Unmindful if the world is wound with fate About her life, knowing not hope nor doubt Nor any yearning for the things without. Her days are folded in a flowerful state, A charm of lily-snows and jasmine-sweets. It irks her nothing if the pale god broods Above the haunts of toil or sorrow beats With leaden wing: she knoweth not the goods Nor ills of men, standing where summer meets With Spring upon the marges of the woods. ON LECONTE DE LISLE'S PROSE TRANSLATION OF HOMER. THERE is a legend of the northland fells, Fabling that in the middle mountain-caves, Soundless and dumb, a mighty music waves, Frozen into silence by eternal spells, Till some fair hero pierce the mist that dwells Above the music's mystery-hearted graves. Then shall the song soar with a noise of glaives To-smitten and the trumpet's silver swells Rehearse the glories of the ancient time. So hast thou, poet from the tropic isles,— Coming, breast-armoured with the gold sun's smiles, Into our Northland,—set old Homer free From all the tangling coil of modern rhyme And loosed the sheer song on us like a sea. AFTER LONG YEARS. THE memories of summer are not dead, The roses and the bird-songs and the sun: Though autumn shadow all the skies with dun And all the golden year be overspread With shrouding snows, yet roses have been red, Linnets have sung and June has gilt the day; And Springtide, peering through the winter's grey, Calls up pale phantasms of the glories fled, Primroses budding through the scarce-thawed rime, A memory and a foreshadowing. So with these firstlings of my second Spring, March-prophecies of summer-tided rhyme, After long years I bring as offering To the pale memories of that pleasant time. FATAL ATTAINMENT. HAPLY, my hope shall find me unawares, Fall on me from a thunder-smitten sky, As Spring-light changed to lightning-flash; and I,— Bent to some gross dull web of clinging cares, Having forgot the aim of all my prayers But for that second,—see the thing on high And knowing it for awful and so nigh, Lose heart to grasp it or to mount the stairs Of light let down to lift me heavenward. So all my soul shall shrink into a sigh Of impotence; and with its sense outpoured Into one unrelenting ecstacy Of yearning for the mirage golden-shored, My life shall fold its frail faint wings and die. JACOB AND THE ANGEL. (For a design by J. T. Nettleship.) SHALL he not bless me? Will he never speak Those words of proud concession, “Let me go: For the day breaketh?” Wearily and slow The shrouded hours troop past across the peak, Eastering; and I, with hands grown all too weak And strength that would have failed me long ago, But for the set soul, strain to overthrow The instant God.—Alas! 'tis I that speak— Not Jacob—I that in this night of days Do wrestle with the angel Art, till breath And gladness fail me. Yet the stern soul stays And will not loose him till he bless me; ay, Even though the night defer my victory Until the day break on the dawn of death. SIBYL. THIS is the glamour of the world antique: The thyme-scents of Hymettus fill the air And in the grass narcissus-cups are fair. The full brook wanders through the ferns to seek The amber haunts of bees and on the peak Of the soft hill, against the gold-marged sky, She stands, a dream from out the days gone by. Entreat her not. Indeed, she will not speak. Her eyes are full of dreams and in her ears There is the rustle of immortal wings; And ever and anon the slow breeze bears The mystic murmur of the songs she sings. Entreat her not: she sees thee not nor hears Aught but the sights and sounds of bygone Springs. LONG DESIRE. SURELY the world is sad with my sick hope. There comes no stirring in the air for Spring, No sweep of wings nor any blossoming Of leaf-buds, red against the grey cloud-scope. The mocking sunlight falls athwart the slope Of the pale flowerless fields, as if to find Some faint flower-trace, mayhap remained behind Of the past happy time. And I, I grope For aye amongst the ashes of old bliss, Seeking some unpaled spark wherewith to light The torch of Hope, that well-nigh faded is Within my breast, if haply from the height Of heaven should come, on wings of memories, Some soft-plumed angel of the old delight. ON THE BORDERS OF THE NIGHT. THE imminent fulness of the days to come; The nameless terror of the half-seen hills, Whereo'er the storm broods and the thunder fills The dreadful palaces of Space and Doom; The long-drawn silences; the mists that loom Across the sun-break and the radiant sills Of morning; these it is that blunt the wills Of wingless men and weigh them to the tomb With unspent souls and lives that have outcast No seed of hope upon the fields of day: So that they wander in a lightless way, Hand-lifting ever; “Will it come at last, (If God live), that fair Present, purged away From the black Future and the bitter Past?” Ay, will it come? Alas, alas! the night Flies low and swift along the greying West. Which of our dreams shall fare the swiftliest? Our hopes of Life to flower in the light Of full mid-Present or the noiseless flight Of that sad angel of the sorely-prest, That brings the balsams and the wine of rest? The “must” of sleep comes hard upon the “might” Of action, filling up the hollow years And the blank days left flowerless for the time When the rent cloud shall certify our fears Or crown our hopes of heaven, as it nears With flame-lined flanks or crests up which there climb Rain-mists that drop with all the hoarded tears. Lo! if the sleep came, haply it were well. How should we face it, if it came too near, Too full and bright on us for eyes to bear, That terrible glory of the Invisible, A splendour like a fire, ineffable, More dreadful than the thunder, all too fair, Too wholly perfect in the kindling air Of upper heaven? Or if there befell To us the other fortune, the sheer sight Of all the glooms of Fate and Fear and Hell, The full abysmal presence of the Night, The night unsanctified by any bell Of starlit heavens, blotting out Life's light With rays of darkness unendurable? Sure, it were well for us to lay life down And sleep the undawning slumber of the dead; Whilst over us the appointed levins sped And the bolts broke upon the mountains brown; Uncareful if the middle air were strown With the blue flowers of day or sunset's red Of coming thunder-blasts,—if night were spread, A lurid vault of storm-clouds all wind-blown Into the furnace of the wrath to come, Or else a dome of many-coloured light. Sleep should be whole for us and kindly gloom, Unstirred by any pain or love-delight; A kind child-slumber in its mother's womb; An overfolding of the wings of Night. Peace! for the shadow draws on us apace, Hiding the unattained and painful years: Peace! for the storm-wind fades from off our ears And out of heaven the grey veil spreads a space Of friendly shade before the upbraiding face Of that To-be which never, never nears. Night shall assoil us of our hopes and fears And our tired sense drink slumber and the grace Of stillness, solacing the restless souls. Let us link hands and sleep, unsorrowing For all the undone hopes, the unwon goals. Haply, some day, from out our wearying— Healed with the years—a new fair life shall spring. Till then, sleep sweet beneath the grassy knolls! FEMME FELLAH DE LANDELLE. O THOU that hold'st the desert in thine eyes, With that long look into the world of dreams, As of deep yearning for the distant streams Of some green oasis that haply lies Beyond the torrid glow of Orient skies In the blue distance! I have known thee long In that dim dreamland, where the fluted song Of nightingales is mixed with dulcet sighs Of scented winds and balm of mystic flowers; And in the white warm moonlight, all bestrewn About the trellised woodways and the bowers Vine-clustered, I have often known the tune Of birds swell sweetlier and the hurrying hours Halt, as thy face grew clear beneath the moon. PROJECTED SHADOWS. AH, memory! ah, ruthless memory! Shall I not have one hour unfilled for thee? Why wilt thou thus usurp the days to be, Unsatisfied with all thy realms that lie Behind the Present? Why o'ercloud the sky, Glad with gold star-scripts of Futurity? Hast thou not made the fleeting hours for me Sunless enough, but thou must flicker by The shrouding years and hovering on the verge Of my horizon's blue, blot out the forms Of all my pleasant creatures of delight, Won with much wrestling from the haggard night, And in their stead paint up a sky of storms And the stern Fury sworded with the scourge? AZALEAS. (A Picture by Albert Moore.) SHE hath no knowledge of the things that stir This modern life of men to toil and stress: Her life is folded in the loveliness Of its sweet self. Around and over her, Flower-petals hover; scents of rose and myrrh Cloister her in from all the worldly ways. Life flows about her, like her pale robe's haze Or the blue vapour round a thurifer, Folding her being in an equal dream, Wherein the birds sing ever, where the flowers Renew Spring's gladness with the new sun's beam And all the year is peaceful in the hours, Heedless of all the weary shapes that seem And wander in this sad wan life of ours. Fair as an alabaster vase she stands, Wherein the unchecked soul is luminous And glorifies its peaceful dwelling-house; Gathering the forspent blossoms with her hands Into the dainty cup, with azure bands Enwound; for all the things she cherisheth Are lovely as herself, even in death, And glitter with the glory of the lands Beyond the ken of man, where Venus waits And Eros sleeps beside Adonis' bed, Low-laid in lilies, where the dreamland's gates Enclose all loveliest things that men deem dead, Until the weary span of years be sped, That shall reclothe them with their pristine states. Dim flowers of dreams, white maiden of a dream, She knoweth not that we are kin to her: She heareth not the clamour and the stir Of joyless men about her gates. The stream Wakes her with babbling and the gold sun's beam Beckons her forth into the budded day. Standing upon the marble silver-grey, Blush-white in myrtle-green and orange-gleam, She strokes her doves and sees the swans adown The ripples waver in the brooklet's glass: Then, folding in her hands her broidered gown, She wanders, smiling, through the jewelled grass, Plucking the violets from their moss-deeps brown; And all things smile to her as she doth pass. BRIDE-NIGHT. (Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, act ii. sc. 2.) SWEET summer, if thy roses knew the song The linnet sang in that dear dream of old, Flooding the night with ripples of song-gold, What while two lovers did their bliss prolong, They would have garnered it from earthly wrong Within their golden hearts, folded it up Deep in the scented purple of their cup, Against the harsh world's griefs and the sad throng Of love-destroying cares; and holding so Within their hearts that essence of all bliss, They would have felt its magic pierce and glow Athwart their veins, till, with the fire of this, All hue had left them for that lovely woe, As lovers pale upon a lingering kiss. FLITTING HOPE. FAIR angel, I have sought thee many a day, Through many mingling ways of smiles and tears, And watched thy shadow flutter through the years. Ay, evermore, the outline cool and grey Of thy soft pinions on the landscape lay, Softening the mocking sunlight and the spears Of the cold silver moon; and still, with ears Eager and strained, I listened for the sway Of thy wide wings across the trembling air. Ah! never to my sight thy presence came, Nor in the midnight nor the noonday's flame; But on the ecstasy of my despair, Worn down to silence, falls the shade the same, A far faint angel with outfluttering hair. LOVE'S EPITAPH. BRING wreaths and crown the golden hours! Pile up the scented snows of Spring! If Love be dead of sorrow's sting, Shall we make dark this day of ours, This day of scents and silver showers And lilts of linnets on the wing? Sing out and let the shadow ring And all the grave run o'er with flowers! If Love, you say, indeed be dead, We will not spare to turn the leaf “Qu'ils tournent le feuillet: sous le pampre est le fruit.” Louis Bertrand.: Spring is as sweet as aye and red And sweet as ever is the rose; He was so fickle, Love! Who knows? He might arise and mock our grief. INDIAN ISLE. I FOUND in dreams a dwelling of delight And did possess it with my soul's desire: An island, cinctured with the radiant fire Of orient noons and girt about with white Of wave-washed reefs, wherein there slumbered bright, Ah! dream-bright bays. that brought the blue sky nigher Down to my wish; and many a flower-sheathed spire Of mystic splendid trees bare up that height Of imminent azure, flowered above the earth. There, for my spirit's ease, my hope I laid, To dwell within that golden-hearted shade And drink the splendour of the things that be, Renewing ever with the new sun's birth And rounded with the slumber of the sea. SIREN. A DREAM came to me in the winter night, A dream of flowers and songs and summer skies, Made beautiful with bloom of memories; And as I fed my long-divorcèd sight Upon that vision of a dead delight, I saw therein a white sad face arise And gold hair fluttered with a wind of sighs. “Ah, mocking dream,” I said, “that dost incite My hope, that sleeps at last, to rise again And seek anew the ways where Life is strong— Knowing it should but weary there in vain— My hope that in the lily-fields full long Of peaceful Death to dreamless rest is lain!” And the dream ended like a broken song. NIRWANA. I WANDER in the halls of memory, Death-dumb and rounded with a web of dreams; And for long fervour of desire, meseems My soul is parted from the things that be And the glad forms of life. Upon a sea Of fluctuant imaginings, that gleams With phosphorescent moony-coloured beams Of lurid fancy, all my days do flee, Seeking for aye some pale and shadowy land Of sweet and delicate sadness, wearying To be poured out like wine into some spring Of wishless being, welling through the sand Of some sun-consecrated sojourning Of souls come back into the Maker's hand. SLEEPERS AND ONE THAT WATCHES. (A Sketch by Simeon Solomon.) WILL the day never dawn? The dim stars weep Great tears of silver on the pall of night And the sad moon, for weariness grown white, Crawls like a mourner up the Eastern steep. I strain my eyes for morning, while these sleep; Dreaming of women, this one with the lips Half-parted, haply,—that in the eclipse Of a child-slumber, dreamless, folded deep, Eyes sealed, as though the hand of sleep strewed flowers Upon their lids, and mouth a fresh-dewed rose, Wet with the kisses of the night. The hours Are very heavy on my soul, that knows No rest: for pinions of the unseen powers Winnow the wind in every breath that blows. Surely, a lance-point glittered in the West; Some trumpet thundered out its voice of doom. But no: my eyes are hazy with the gloom. 'Twas but the moon-rays glancing on the crest Of the tall corn; some bittern from her nest Roused by a snake: for, see, the twain sleep on And nothing stirs their slumber, Oh for one Sweet hour of falling through the deeps of rest, Within that lake of sleep, the dreamy-shored! One little hour of overlidded eyes And folded palms! Ah me! the terror lies Upon my soul; I may not loose my sword, Lest I should wake beneath flame-girdled skies And tremble to the thunders of the Lord. The blackness teems with shapes of fearful things; Weird faces glare at me from out the night And eyes that glitter with the lurid light Of lust and all the horror that it brings. The air is stressful with the pulse of wings; And what time clouds obscure the constant star That overlooks my vigil from afar, Strange voices tempt me with dread whisperings; Dank hands clasp mine and breathings stir my hair, That are no mortal's, wooing me to leap Over the hill-crest, through the swarthy air, Into the hollow night and thence to reap The wonder and the weirdness hidden there. Ah God! the day comes not; and still these sleep. ALTISIDORA. IN the mid-wood I strayed; and as I went, I saw a lady sitting all alone Upon a bank with primroses o'ergrown, With tear-stained eyes and tresses all to-rent. “Sweetheart,” said I, “is all thy joy forspent And all the stir of Spring unfelt for thee, That thou dost linger here so wearily, Flouting the flowers with sorrow and lament?” And she, “Is Spring then blossomed on the lands? Methought the world wore winter with my soul And these pale flowers, dim-set in weft green bands, Blew but as wraiths of the bright host that stands Within the summer-gardens winter stole, To mock my sorrow with his flowerful hands.” LONELY THOUGHT. THE thoughts grow up and blossom in my breast; And some do mock the sun-gold and the blue Of June-clear heavens, some the angry hue Of stormful sundowns blazoned in the West; And others (fairest these and deadliest) Hive in their cups a scented poison-dew, Some honey-sweet and bitter some as rue. And all spring up and die, alike unblest. But in the secret cloisters of my soul A white flower sleeps upon a forest-pool, Undying, and athwart the tree-shade cool Sends up a blended breath of peace and dole: And round the flower strange birds do flit and throng, Sacring the silence with a low, clear song. WESTERING HOPE. THE dainty dream of dawn had swooned away And all the golden chains of noon opprest The pleasance of the woods. Upon the breast Of Spring Life slumbered and the innocent day Linked hands and garlands with the fair mid-May. So for awhile, meseemed, the long unrest Died down to sleep within me; peace outprest Her wine of balms upon me; and I lay Unmemoried, deep-bowered in a nest Of dreams, whose perfumes misted up the way Of Past and Future, till the soft day's wane Piled towers of sunset on the blue hills' crest. Then all my grief came back and once again My soul stretched out sad hands toward the West. SILENTIA LUNÆ. IT seemed to me, this night of many nights, What time the moon lay full on wood and lea, That over all my life there spread one sea Of pearl; and thereupon the mirrored lights Of the soft stars shone out like petal-whites Of gold-heart lilies, floating waveringly Upon the clear moon-silences. Ah me! Might it not be, my sweet, these many nights Of old, that we have steeped our love by-past In the white peace of night, that we have cast Our twinned souls out with kisses and with tears Upon the flooding moon,—that haply we Should with joined hands yet rescue from the sea Some sweetness of the irrevocable years? IGNIS FATUUS. MY soul is like some pale phantasmal light, That flickers o'er a marsh of mystery And with its baleful phosphorescency Stretches long hands of blue into the night. It may not give the fair world to men's sight Nor rescue back the lovely things that be Out of the shrouding gloom; but, from the sea Of dreams, the shadowy armies infinite Of the Invisibles flock forth to it And many a wraith of worlds fantastical Breaks into lurid lapses, stretching through The interambient glooms, with many a hall And cloister, grey with flitting ghosts and lit With many a witch's torch of livid blue. BEATRICE. SWEET, I have sung of thee in many modes, If haply singing I might ease my pain; And still the unwearying Fates bring me again Back by the flowery and the thorny roads To the old goal-point: still my soul forebodes The coming of the sad sweet dreams of old And in my Occident the sunset's gold Grows dim and sad above the lost abodes. Dear, had I loved thee less or loved life more, Had had more hope in men, in love less faith, I should not now be seeking, as of yore, For the faint sadness of dream-violets' breath; I should not now be weaving, o'er and o'er, These bitter melodies of Love and Death. MAY MEMORIES. THE Spring was very glad upon the hills; The sweet pale wind-flowers waited in the grass; And the white lilies, in the river's glass, Floated and fell, with the delight that fills The May-time. So I stood upon the sills Of Faërie (for such to me the wood And all the glamours folded in its flood Of greenery were) thinking the joy, that kills March-sadness in the flowers, might make me whole. But, as I went, the crocus-flames did borrow White lights and sad, as sombre as my soul: Ah me! (the linnet sang) sweet love, sweet sorrow! A golden evening and a sad to-morrow! Spring could not hold from mocking at my dole. Life unfulfilled! The windy scents tha shook The pink-blown glory of the apple-trees, The surge of song that hung upon the breeze, The pale eyes of the primrose-stars, that took Faint heart to peer into the painted book Flower-writ by Spring upon the wide-waved leas; These all made moan to me of my unease: And as I pulled the cresses in the brook, The thin slow water lapsed against my hand, With some faint cadence of blithe murmuring Broken to sadness. Over all the land, As I drew near, the linnets ceased their song, Saying (meseemed), “What wight goes thus in Spring, Songless and sad, the dreamy day along?” My feet turned back into the well-worn ways, Hollowed between the tree-marge and the rill; And as I went, old memories did fill My soul with longing for the bygone days. The lush scents from the grey-pearled hawthorn maze, The birds' and breezes' babble and the stream's Brought back to me the songs I made in dreams, In the old days long dead; the bright sweet lays, Hymning high valour in the world's despite; The long untroubled lapses of swift song, Brimming with ecstasy the luminous night, As a thrush, piping, fills it; sweet and strong And pure as ripples of the fresh sun's light, Falling the glad wide ways and aisles along. There walked for me along the flower-hung glades The shadowy figures of the world of song Of my pure youth, a white and rosy throng Of fair tall queens and lily-drooping maids, Shadowing pink cheeks with hyacinthine braids And feathered gold of many-glancing locks. The mailed knights clash'd together in the shocks Of clamorous war and through the spangled shades, The mystic echoes of old questing went. There was no thing in all that dream untold For me, upon the woods with hawthorn sprent, Of the old life; and in the primrose-gold, The new came back to me with dreariment, In memories of the love that long lies cold. OUTSTRETCHED HANDS. IS there no sweetness save of ripened fruit? Lies all men's gladness in fulfilled desire? Is no flame blander than fruition's fire, That with swift flowerage burns away its root? Life passes by, and still my heart is mute. Day follows night; and yet the sky no nigher Leans to my hope. Shall all my days expire And all my soul grow grey with the pursuit? Shall life waste alway in this torrid blast Of unstayed passion? Oh! it cannot be But that some day the spirit shall have cast Its slough of lusts, that in some luminous sea Surely a man's desire shall purgèd be, Surely the early peace come back at last. ANGEL DEATH. LO! I have made an end of many things, Singing; yet never have I sung to thee, Belovèd angel, that by Life's sad sea Standest star-crowned, whilst all the dusk air rings With the quick spirit-pulse of viewless wings: No voice of mine has lifted litany To thee with song, no hand of mine set free The soul of praise that slumbers in the strings. For am I not to thee as one (in this) That lingers by some shining water-deeps, When the slow tide sings in its moon-stilled sleeps, Until his heart-strings catch its harmonies And his life pulses to the time it keeps: And yet thereof no thing he speaks, ywis. BURIED CITIES. IF one should wander, in a boat of dreams, Upon the charmèd ocean of the Past, Peering, with paddling hands and eyes down-cast, Into the amethystine deeps, meseems He should see many wonders, by the beams Of backward memory; the phantoms vast And awful of the cities of the past Uplooming through the deeps with sudden gleams Of glancing towers and jewel-wroughten spires; And therein too there should be visible, Methinks, about the streets strange flitting fires, Wearing his hopes' soul-semblance; and the spell Should be sung round with silver sound of lyres And the sad song of some far golden bell. EXIT. THIS is my House of Dreams—a house of shade, Built with the fleeting visions of the night: Here have I set my youth and all its white Sad mem'ries—in this dwelling that I made With idle rhyme, as lonely fancy bade. If any wonder at the strange sad might The God of Visions holds upon my sight And set himself my weak song to upbraid For all the wailing notes therein that teem, I pray him of his favour that to lands Of sunnier clime he wend; for things that seem Are here the things of life and give commands To living; for a dream is on my hands And on my life the shadow of a dream. WITH A COPY OF THE DIVINA COMMEDIA. FRIEND, in this book I proffer thee hereby, The angelic voice of him my song obeys, The well-nigh God and master of my lays, With various speech, of matters rare and high, That harpnotes now, now thunder doth outvie, Discourseth in his verses passing praise. This treasured work of all who bear the bays, A poet, to thee, poet, offer I, That evermore a pledge betwixt us twain Of friendship and to boot a sign it may Be of the common travel in the Way Of our two souls, that various of strain More than in heaven benighted star and star, But none the less conjoined in variance are. SUNFLOWER SOUL. LIKE as the sunflower lifts up to the sun Its star of summer, in the noontide heat, Following the sacred circuit of his feet, What while toward the house of Night they run; Nor when the glad Day's glory is fordone And the sun ceases from the starry street, It leaves to turn to his celestial seat, Seeking his face behind the shadows dun; Even so my heart, from out these darkening days, Whose little light is sad for winter's breath, Strains upward still, with song and prayer and praise, Ensuing ever, through the gathering haze, Those twin suns of our darkness, Love and Death, That rule the backward and the forward ways. WITH A COPY OF HENRY VAUGHAN'S SACRED POEMS. LAY down thy burden at this gate and knock. What if the world without be dark and drear? For there be fountains of refreshment here Sweeter than all the runnels of the rock. Hark! even to thy hand upon the lock A wilding warble answers, loud and clear, That falls as fain upon the heart of fear As shepherds' songs unto the folded flock. This is the quiet wood-church of the soul. Be thankful, heart, to him betimes that stole, Some Easter morning, through the golden door— Haply ajar for early prayer to rise— And brought thee back from that song-flowered shore These haunting harmonies of Paradise. J. B. COROT. Died 22nd February, 1875. BEFORE the earliest violet he died, Who loved the new green and the stress of Spring So tenderly. He knew that March must bring The primrose by the brook and all the wide Green spaces of the forest glorified With scent and singing, when each passing wing Would call him and each burst of blossoming: He knew he could not die in the Spring-tide. Yet he was weary, for his task was done And sleep seemed sweet unto the tiréd eyes: Weary! for many a year he had seen the sun Arise; so in the season of the snows He put off life—ere Spring could interpose To hold him back—and went where Gautier lies. ALOE-BLOSSOM. LIFE stayed for me within a breach of days, Sundered athwart the grey and rocky years: Above, the day was dim to me for fears And memories of the many-chasmed ways Through which my feet had struggled. At amaze, Silent I stood and listened with wide ears, As for the coming of some Fate that nears At last across the moon-mist and the haze. The haggard earth lay speechless at my feet; But, as I waited, suddenly there came Within me as the flowering of a flame; And like the mystic bud that bursts to meet Its hundredth Spring with thunder and acclaim, Love flowered upon me, terrible and sweet. DREAM-LIFE. IT seems to me sometimes that I am dead And watch the live world in its ceaseless stream Pass by me through the pauses of a dream. The dawn breaks blue on them, the sunset's red Burns on their smiles and on the tears they shed; The moonlight floods them with its silver gleam: To me they are as ghosts that do but seem; Their grief is strange to me, their gladness dread. Life lapses, like a vision dim and grey, Before my sight, a cloud-wrack in the sky. Since I am dead I can no longer die: Ah, can it be this doom is laid on me, To see the tired world slowly pass away Nor die, but live on everlastingly? AD ZOÏLOS. CHIDE me who will for that my song is sad And all my fancy follows on the wave That bears our little being to the grave! When did it fail that those—whose lives were glad For lack of light and want of virtue had To know the mystery and the hair-hung glaive That shadow all our life so seeming brave— The accusing wail of those that weep forbad? Peace, triflers! Peace, dull ears and heedless eyne! Yet haply Time unto your foolish fears Shall yield a mocking áccord and the years, Falling full-fated on these days of mine, Crush from the grapes of grief a bitter wine Of laughters, sadder than the saddest tears. INDIAN SUMMER. I SAID, “The time of grief is overpast: The mists of morning hold the plains no more; The flowers of Spring are dead; the woods that wore The silver suits of Summer o'er them cast Are stripped and bare before the wintry blast. Is it for thee to weary and implore The ruthless Gods, to beat against their door For ever and for ever to the last? Rise and be strong; yonder the new life lies. Who knows but haply, past the sand-hills traced Bounding the prospect, Destiny have placed A sunny land of flowers and sapphire skies, For balm of hearts and cure of loves laid waste? Up, and leave weeping to a woman's eyes!” Then turned I sadly to the olden signs By which I had so long lived lingering; The faded woods, the birds long ceased to sing, The withered grapes dried on the withered vines And the thin rill that through the time-worn lines Of grey-leaved herbs fled, faintly murmuring Its ghostly memories of the songs of Spring, Weird whispers of the wind among the pines. Farewell I bade them all, with heart as sad Well-nigh as when Love left me long ago, And turned into the distance. Long I had Their murmur in my ears, as long and slow The melancholy way did spread and wind That left the memories of youth behind. At last a new land opened on my view: No phantom of the dear dead Spring of old It was, but a fair land of Autumn gold And corn-fields sloping to a sea of blue: And I looked down upon its face and knew The Autumn land of which my heart had told, The land where Love at last should be consoled And balm flower forth among Life's leaves of rue. A sunset-land it was; and long and sweet, The shadows of the setting lay on it: And through the long fair valleys there did flit Strange birds with pale gold wings, that did repeat The loveliest songs whereof men aye had wit; And over all the legend “Peace” was writ. And as I gazed on it, my heart was filled With rapture of the sudden cease of pain: And in my spirit, ever and again, There rang the golden legend, sweet and stilled With speech of birds; and in the pauses rilled Fair fountains through the green peace of the plain, That with the tinkle of their golden rain Made carol to the songs the linnets trilled; Whilst, over all, the waves upon the shore Throbbed with a music, sad but very sweet, That had in it the melodies of yore, Softened, as when the angels do repeat, In heaven, to souls in rapture of new birth, The names that they have sadly borne on earth. FADED LOVE. FAREWELL, sweetheart! Farewell, our golden days! So runs the cadence, ringing out the tune Of sighs and kisses: for the tale of June Is told and all the length of flowered ways Fades in the distance, as the new life lays Its hand upon the strings and all too soon Breaks the brief song of birds and flowers and moon That held the Maytime. What is this that stays? —A white-robed figure, with sad eyes that hold A far-off dream of never-travelled ways; Wan with white lips and hands as pale and cold As woven garlands of long-vanished Mays, And the sun's memory halo-like above Its head.—It is the wraith of faded Love. SAD SUMMER. AH Summer, lady of the flowered lands, When shall thy lovely looks bring back to me, —To me who strain into the grey sad sea Of dreams unsatisfied and with stretched hands Implore the stern sky and the changeless sands For some faint sign of that which was to be So perfect and so fair a life to see,— The time of songs and season of flower-bands? At least, for guerdon of full many a lay In praise of thee and of thy youngling Spring, What time my lips were yet attuned to sing, Let not thy roses redden in my way Too flauntingly nor all thy golden day Insult my silence with too glad a ring. THE LAST OF THE GODS. THE world is worn with many weary years; The day is dim for long desire of death; Life languishes amid its burning breath Of nights and days, of barren hopes and fears, Of joys that sing in vain to listless ears. For Love and Spring are dead for lack of faith And in the bird-songs goes a voice that saith, “Who shall absolve us of this life of tears?” Ah, who indeed? Who shall avail to save Our souls that wither on the wrecks of life? Is any strong among the Gods men crave Enough to take again the gifts He gave, To draw death like a dream upon our strife And soothe the sick world to its grateful grave? Nay, who shall hope, when God Himself implores, With piteous hands, the unremorseful sleep,— When Gods and men, from one abysmal deep Of loveless life, lift hands toward the shores Of the unnearing rest—through Time, that roars With wave on wave of years to come—and weep In undistinguished anguish, as they keep Life's hopeless vigil at Death's stirless doors? Lo! of all Gods that men have knelt unto,— Of all the dread Immortals fierce and fair, That men have painted on the vault of blue,— There is but one remains, of all that were. DEATH hath put on their crowns; and to Him sue Mortals and Gods in parity of prayer. ENGLAND'S HOPE. (KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM.) WHELP of the lion-breed of Wellington; Careless to fit the date unto the deed Or trumpet forth, that all who run may read, His valiant worth to every mother's son; In the lost field, as in the victory won, Steadfast alike, unrecking whose the meed, So but the achievement of his country's need And honour saved attend on duty done: Diluting action not with vain debate; Contemptuous of Fortune's good and ill; Not blown about, as is the unstable soul, Hither and thither with each shift of fate, But constant as the compass to the pole, Fast founded on th'unconquerable will. Nov. 1900. SARVARTHASIDDHA-BUDDHA. THE desert of the unaccomplished years Fills the round compass of our careful eyes And still, from age to age, the same suns rise And life troops past, a masque of smiles and tears: The same void hopes vie with the same vain fears And in the grey sad circuit of the skies, To the monotonous music of our sighs, We plod toward the goal that never nears. Ah, who shall solve us of the dreary days, The unlived life and the tormenting dreams, That on the happy blank of easeful night Paint evermore for us the backward ways And the old mirage, with its cheating streams, And urge us back into the unwon fight? We turn for comfort to the wise of old, For tidings of the land that lies ahead, The land to which their firmer feet have led, Hymning its shores of amethyst and gold. We ask; the answer comes back stern and cold; “Gird up your loins! Rest is not for the dead. “Beyond the graveyard and the evening-red, “New lives and ever yet new lives unfold.” —Ye speak in vain. If rest be not from life, What reck we of new worlds and clearer air, Of brighter suns and skies of deeper blue, If life and all its weariness be there? Is there no sage of all we turn unto Will guide us to the guerdon of our strife? Yes, there is one: for the sad sons of man, That languish in the deserts, travail-worn, Five times five hundred years ago was born, Under those Orient skies, from whence began All light, a saviour from the triple ban Of birth and death and life renewed forlorn. Third of the Christs he came to those who mourn: Prometheus, Hercules had led the van. His scriptures were the forest and the fen: From the dead flower he learnt and the spent night The lesson of the eternal nothingness, How what is best is ceasing from the light And putting off life's raiment of duresse, And taught it to the weary race of men. He did not mock the battle-broken soul With promise of vain heavens beyond the tomb, As who should think to break the boding gloom Of stormful skies, uplifting to the pole Gilt suns and tinsel stars. Unto their dole, Who batten on life's galls, he knew no doom Is dread as that which in death's darkling womb Rewrites life's endless and accurséd scroll. Wherefore he taught that to abstain is best, Seeing that to those, who have their hope in nought, Peace quicklier comes and that eternal rest, Wherein enspheréd thou, Siddartha, art, Chief of the high sad souls that sit apart, Throned in their incommunicable thought. OMAR KHEYYAM. O THOU, the Orient morning's nightingale, That, from the darkness of the Long Ago, Thy note of unpropitiable woe Cast'st out upon the Time-travérsing gale, —Its burden still Life's lamentable tale, Too late come hither and too soon to go, Whence brought and whither bounden none doth know Nor why thrust forth into this world of wail,— We, thy sad brethren of the Western lands, Sons of the Secret of this latter day, We, who have sailed with thee the sea of tears, Have trod with thee the BLOOD-DEVOURING WAY, We, thy soul's mates, with thee join hearts and hands Across the abysses of eight hundred years. FROM BOCCACCIO. TO PETRARCH DEAD. NOW, dear my lord, unto those realms of light Thou'rt mounted, whither looketh still to fare Each soul of God elect unto that share, On its departure from this world of spite; Now art thou where full oft the longing spright Drew thee, with Laura to commune whilere: Now art thou come whereas my lovely fair Fiammetta Boccaccio's mistress, the Princess Maria of Naples. sitteth with her in God's sight. Yea, with Sennuccio Sennuccio del Bene, a fourteenth-century Florentine poet and a friend of Petrarch, who celebrated him in his verse., Cino Cino da Pistoia, the contemporary and friend of Dante., Dante, thou Assured of ease enternal dwellest now, Things seeing our intelligence above. Oh, in this world if I was dear to thee, Draw thou me straight to thee, where I may see, Joyful, her face who fired me first with love. TO HIS OWN SOUL, EXHORTING IT TO REPENTANCE. TURN, turn thee, weary soul: nay, hearken me. Turn thee and note where thou hast run astray, The course of idle lusts ensuing aye, And in the fosse thy feet enmired thou'lt see. Wake, ere thou fall! What dost thou? Presently Return to Him, Him who the true allay To who will giv'th and from the sore affray Of woeful death, whereto thou far'st, doth free. Return thee unto Him and thy last years Yield, at the least, unto His will and gree, Mourning the ills done in the days bygone. Let the late season waken not thy fears; He will accept thee, doing unto thee That which He did erst with the last hired one. Alluding, of course, to the parable of the labourers in the vineyard, Matt. XX, 1—16. OF THREE DAMSELS IN A MEADOW. ABOUT a well-spring, in a little mead, Of tender grasses full and flow'rets fair, There sat three youngling angels, Angiolette, lit. “she-angellings”, i.e. pretty young girls. as it were Their loves recounting; and for each, indeed, Her sweet face shaded, 'gainst the noontide need, A spray of green, that bound her golden hair; Whilst, in and out by turns, a frolic air The two clear colours blended at its heed. And one, after a little, thus heard I Say to her mates, “Lo, if by chance there lit The lovers of each one of us hereby, Should we flee hence for fear of quiet sit?” Whereto the twain made answer, “Who should fly From such a fortune sure were scant of wit.” EXOTICA. CHANT ROYAL OF THE GOD OF LOVE. O MOST fair God! O Love both new and old, That wast before the flowers of morning blew, Before the glad sun in his mail of gold Leapt into light across the first day's dew, That art the first and last of our delight, That in the blue day and the purple night Holdest the heart of servant and of king, Lord of liesse, sovran of sorrowing, That in thy hand hast heaven's golden key And hell beneath the shadow of thy wing, Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee! What thing rejects thine empery? Who so bold But at thine altars in the dusk they sue? Even the strait pale Goddess, silver-stoled, That kissed Endymion when the Spring was new, To thee did homage in her own despite, When, in the shadow of her wings of white, She slid down trembling from her moonèd ring To where the Latmian youth lay slumbering. And in that kiss put off cold chastity. Who but acclaim, with voice and pipe and string, Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee? Master of men and gods, in every fold Of thy wide vans, the sorceries that renew The labouring earth tranced with the winter's cold Lie hid, the quintessential charms that woo The souls of flowers, slain with the sullen might Of the dead year, and draw them to the light. Balsam and blessing to thy garments cling: Skyward and seaward, whilst thy white palms fling Their spells of healing over land and sea, One shout of homage makes the welkin ring, Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee! I see thee throned aloft: thy fair hands hold Myrtles for joy and euphrasy and rue: Laurels and roses round thy white brows rolled, And in thine eyes the royal heaven's hue: But in thy lip's clear colour, ruddy bright, The heart's blood burns of many a hapless wight. Thou art not only fair and sweet as Spring: Terror and beauty, fear and wondering, Meet on thy front, amazing all who see. All men do praise thee, ay, and every thing: Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee! I fear thee, though I love. Who shall behold The sheer sun blazing in the orbèd blue, What while the noontide over hill and wold Flames like a fire, except his mazèd view Wither and tremble? So thy splendid sight Fills me with mingled gladness and affright. Thy visage haunts me in the wavering Of dreams and in the dawn, awakening, I feel thy splendour streaming full on me. Both joy and fear unto thy feet I bring: Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee! ENVOI. God above gods, high and eternal king! Whose praise the symphonies of heaven sing, I find no whither from thy power to flee Save in thy pinions' vast o'ershadowing: Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee! VIRELAY. AS I sat sorrowing, Love came and bade me sing A joyous song and meet: For see (said he) each thing Is merry for the Spring And every bird doth greet The break of blossoming, That all the woodlands ring Unto the young hours' feet. Wherefore put off defeat And rouse thee to repeat The chime of merles that go, With flutings shrill and sweet, In every green retreat, The tune of streams that flow And mark the young hours' beat With running ripples fleet And breezes soft and low. For who should have, I trow, Such joyance in the glow And pleasance of the May, In all sweet bells that blow, In death of winter's woe And birth of Springtide gay, When in wood-walk and row Hand-link'd the lovers go, As he to whom alway God giveth, day by day, To set to roundelay The sad and sunny hours, To weave into a lay Life's golden years and grey, Its sweet and bitter flowers, To sweep, with hands that stray In many a devious way, Its harp of sun and showers? Nor in this life of ours, Whereon the sky oft lowers, Is any lovelier thing Than in the wild wood bowers The cloud of green that towers, The blithe birds welcoming The vivid vernal hours Among the painted flowers And all the pomp of Spring. True, life is on the wing, And all the birds that sing And all the flowers that be Amid the glow and ring, The pomp and glittering Of Spring's sweet pageantry, Have here small sojourning; And all our blithe hours bring Death nearer, as they flee. Yet this thing learn of me: The sweet hours fair and free That we have had of yore, The glad things we did see, The linkèd melody Of waves upon the shore That rippled in their glee, Are not lost utterly, Though they return no more. But in the true heart's core Thought treasures evermore The tune of birds and breeze; And there the slow years store The flowers our dead Springs wore And scent of blossomed leas; There murmurs o'er and o'er The sound of woodlands hoar With newly burgeoned trees. So for the sad soul's ease Remembrance treasures these Against time's harvesting; And so, when mild Death frees The soul from Life's disease Of strife and sorrowing, In glass of memories The new hope looks and sees Through death a brighter Spring. RONDEAU REDOUBLÉ. MY day and night are in my lady's hand; I have none other sunrise than her sight: For me her favour glorifies the land, Her anger darkens all the cheerful light. Her face is fairer than the hawthorn white, When all a-flower in May the hedge-rows stand: Whilst she is kind, I know of none affright: My day and night are in my lady's hand. All heaven in her glorious eyes is spanned: Her smile is softer than the Summer night, Gladder than daybreak on the Faery strand: I have none other sunrise than her sight. Her silver speech is like the singing flight Of runnels rippling o'er the jewelled sand; Her kiss a dream of delicate delight; For me her favour glorifies the land. What if the Winter slay the Summer bland! The gold sun in her hair burns ever bright: If she be sad, straightway all joy is banned: Her anger darkens all the cheerful light. Come weal or woe, I am my lady's knight And in her service every ill withstand: Love is my lord, in all the world's despite, And holdeth in the hollow of his hand My day and night. DOUBLE BALLAD OF THE SINGERS OF THE TIME. WHY are our songs like the moan of the main, When the wild winds buffet it to and fro, (Our brothers ask us again and again) A weary burden of hopes laid low? Have birds left singing or flowers to blow? Is Life cast down from its fair estate? This I answer them—nothing mo'— Songs and singers are out of date. What shall we sing of? Our hearts are fain, Our bosoms burn with a sterile glow. Shall we sing of the sordid strife for gain, For shameful honour, for wealth and woe, Hunger and luxury,—weeds that throw Up from one seeding their flowers of hate? Can we tune our lutes to these themes? Ah no! Songs and singers are out of date. Our songs should be of Faith without stain, Of haughty honour and deaths that sow The seeds of life on the battle-plain, Of loves unsullied and eyes that show The fair white soul in the deeps below. Where are they, these that our songs await To wake to joyance? Doth any know? Songs and singers are out of date. What have we done with meadow and lane? Where are the flowers and the hawthorn-snow? Acres of brick in the pitiless rain,— These are our gardens for thorpe and stow. Summer has left us long ago, Turned to the lands where the turtles mate And the crickets chirp in the wild-rose row. Songs and singers are out of date. We sit and sing to a world in pain; Our hertstrings quiver sadly and slow: But, aye and anon, the murmurous strain Swells up to a clangour of strife and throe And the folk that hearken, or friend or foe, Are ware that the stress of the time is great And say to themselves, as they come and go, Songs and singers are out of date. Winter holds us, body and brain: Ice is over our being's flow; Song is a flower that will droop and wane, If it have no heaven tow'rd which to grow. Faith and beauty are dead, I trow; Nothing is left but fear and fate: Men are weary of hope; and so Songs and singers are out of date. BALLAD OF POETS. WHAT do we here, who with reverted eyes Turn back our longings from the modern air To the dim gold of long-evanished skies, When other songs in other mouths were fair? Why do we stay the load of life to bear, To measure still the weary worldly ways, Waiting upon the still-recurring sun, That ushers in another waste of days, Of roseless Junes and unenchanted Mays? Why but because our task is yet undone? Were it not thus, could but our high emprise Be once fulfilled, which of us would forbear To seek that haven where contentment lies? Who would not doff at once life's load of care, To sleep at peace amid the silence there? Ah, who, alas?—Across the heat and haze, Death beckons to us in the shadow dun, Favouring and fair. “My rest is sweet,” he says: But we reluctantly avert our gaze; Why but because our task is yet undone? Songs have we sung and many melodies Have from our lips had issue rich and rare: But never yet the conquering chant did rise, That should ascend the very heaven's stair, To rescue life from anguish and despair. Often and again, drunk with delight of lays, “Lo,” have we cried, “this is the golden one That shall deliver us!”—Alas! Hope's rays Die in the distance and life's sadness stays: Why but because our task is yet undone? ENVOI. Great God of Love, thou whom all poets praise, Grant that the aim of rest for us be won! Let the light shine upon our life that strays, Disconsolate, within the desert maze, Why but because our task is yet undone? VILLANELLE. THE air is white with snow-flakes clinging; Between the gusts that come and go Methinks I hear the woodlark singing. Methinks I see the primrose springing On many a bank and hedge, although The air is white with snowflakes clinging. Surely, the hands of Spring are flinging Wood-scents to all the winds that blow: Methinks I hear the woodlark singing. Methinks I see the swallow winging Across the woodlands sad with snow; The air is white with snowflakes clinging. Was that the cuckoo's wood-chime swinging? Was that the linnet fluting low? Methinks I hear the woodlark singing. Or can it be the breeze is bringing The breath of violets? Ah no! The air is white with snowflakes clinging. It is my lady's voice that's stringing Its beads of gold to song; and so Methinks I hear the woodlark singing. The violets I see upspringing Are in my lady's eyes, I trow: The air is white with snowflakes clinging. Dear, whilst thy tender tones are ringing, E'en though amidst the winter's woe The air is white with snowflakes clinging, Methinks I hear the woodlark singing. RONDEL. [KISS me, sweetheart; the Spring is here] KISS me, sweetheart; the Spring is here And Love is lord of you and me. The bluebells beckon each passing bee; The wild wood laughs to the flowered year: There is no bird in brake or brere But to his little mate sings he, “Kiss me, sweetheart; the Spring is here And Love is lord of you and me.” The blue sky laughs out sweet and clear; The missel-thrush upon the tree Pipes for sheer gladness loud and free; And I go singing to my dear, “Kiss me, sweetheart; the Spring is here And Love is lord of you and me.” BALLAD OF PAST DELIGHT. WHERE are the dreams of the days gone by, The hopes of honour, the glancing play Of fire-new fancies that filled our sky, The songs we sang in the middle May, Carol and ballad and roundelay? Where are the garlands our young hands twined? Life's but a memory, wellaway! All else flits past on the wings of the wind. Where are the ladies fair and high— Marie and Alice and Maud and May And merry Madge with the laughing eye— And all the gallants of yesterday That held us merry,—ah, where are they? Under the mould we must look to find Some; and the others are worn and grey. All else flits past on the wings of the wind. I know of nothing that lasts, not I, Save a heart that is true to its love alway; A love that is won with tear and sigh And never changes or fades away, In a breast that is oftener sad than gay; A tender look and a constant mind; These are the only things that stay. All else flits past on the wings of the wind. ENVOI. Prince, I counsel you, never say, “Alack for the years that are left behind!” Look you keep love when your dreams decay; All else flits past on the wings of the wind. RONDEAU. ONE of these days, my lady whispereth, A day made beautiful with Summer's breath, Our feet shall cease from these divided ways, Our lives shall leave the distance and the haze And flower together in a mingling wreath. No pain shall part us then, no grief amaze, No doubt dissolve the glory of our gaze; Earth shall be heaven for us twain, she saith, One of these days. Ah love, my love! Athwart how many Mays The old hope lures us with its long delays! How many winters waste our fainting faith! I wonder, will it come this side of death, With any of the old sun in its rays, One of these days? BALLAD OF LOVE'S DESPITE. Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un instant; Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie. IN my young time, full many a lady bright I wooed and recked but little how I sped. Was one unkind, it caused me small despite; With careless heart a light “Farewell!” I said And wooed another maiden in her stead. Thus fared I joyously and thought no wrong To mock at lovers in a jesting song And heeded not if one to me did say, “Beware! Love's bliss endureth not for long; Love's sadness lasts for ever and a day!” I made a mock of Love and his delight, Styled it a fever of fond fancies bred And women toys, too idle and too slight To be remembered, when desire was dead. Alack! the sword hung o'er me by a thread; I too must kneel among the love-lorn throng And prove how high Love's power is and how strong. For lo! I loved a maiden bright and gay And learnt, alas! though Love be little long, Love's sadness lasts for ever and a day! True, she loved me in turn and life was light For many a day, whilst in her eyes I read The sweet confession of Love's rosy might: But soon, alack! her flitting fancy fled And settled lightly on another's head. Ah, who so hapless then as I! Among The woods I wandered, smarting 'neath the thong Of his fell scourge and wailing out alway The old refrain, “Love's bliss is little long; Love's sadness lasts for ever and a day.” ENVOI. Prince, in delight that walk'st the world along, Chiefest of those that unto Love belong, Take heed unto the burden of my lay And know, Love's pleasance is but little long; Love's sadness lasts for ever and a day. RONDEAU. LIFE lapses by for you and me, Our sweet days pass us by and flee And evermore Death draws us nigh: The blue fades fast out of our sky, The ripple ceases from our sea. What would we not give, you and I, The early sweet of life to buy? Alas! sweetheart, that cannot we; Life lapses by. Yet, though our young years buried lie, Shall love with Spring and Summer die? What if the roses faded be? We in each other's eyes will see New Springs nor question how or why Life lapses by. VILLANELLE. (With a copy of Swinburne's Poems and Ballads. Second Series.) THE thrush's singing days are fled; His heart is dumb for love and pain: The nightingale shall sing instead. Too long the wood-bird's heart hath bled With love and dole at every vein: The thrush's singing days are fled. The music in his breast is dead, His soul will never flower again: The nightingale shall sing instead. Love's rose has lost its early red, The golden year is on the wane; The thrush's singing days are fled. The years have beaten down his head, He's mute beneath the winter's rain: The nightingale shall sing instead. Hard use hath snapped the golden thread Of all his wild-wood songs in twain; The thrush's singing days are fled. His voice is dumb for drearihead: What matters it? In wood and lane The nightingale shall sing instead. Sweet, weary not for what is sped. What if, for stress of heart and brain, The thrush's singing days are fled? The nightingale shall sing instead. KYRIELLE. A LARK in the mesh of the tangled vine, A bee that drowns in the flower-cup's wine, A fly in the mote's each mother's son: All things must end that have begun. A little pain, a little pleasure, A little heaping-up of treasure; Then no more gazing upon the sun. All things must end that have begun. Where is the time for hope or doubt? A puff of the wind, and life is out; A turn of the wheel, and rest is won. All things must end that have begun. Golden morning and purple night, Life that fails with the failing light. Deathless but Death alone is none: All things must end that have begun. Ending waits on the brief beginning. Is the prize worth the stress of winning? E'en in the dawning the day is done. All things must end that have begun. Weary waiting and weary striving, Glad outsetting and sad arriving; What is it worth when the race is run? All things must end that have begun. Speedily fades the morning glitter; Love grows irksome and wine grows bitter; Two are parted from what was one. All things must end that have begun. Toil and pain and the evening rest: Joy is weary and sleep is best; Fair and softly life's spool is spun: All things must end that have begun. PANTOUM. THE wind brings up the hawthorn's breath, The sweet airs ripple up the lake: My soul, my soul is sick to death, My heart, my heart is like to break. The sweet airs ripple up the lake, I hear the thin woods' fluttering: My heart, my heart is like to break; What part have I, alas! in Spring? I hear the thin woods' fluttering; The brake is brimmed with linnet-song: What part have I, alas! in Spring? For me, heart's winter is lifelong. The brake is brimmed with linnet-song; Clear carols flutter through the trees; For me, heart's winter is lifelong; I cast my sighs on every breeze. Clear carols flutter through the trees; The new year hovers like a dove: I cast my sighs on every breeze; Spring is no Spring, forlorn of love. The new year hovers like a dove Above the breast of the green earth: Spring is no Spring, forlorn of love; Alike to me are death and birth. Above the breast of the green earth, The soft sky flutters like a flower: Alike to me are death and birth; I dig Love's grave in every hour. The soft sky flutters like a flower Along the glory of the hills: I dig Love's grave in every hour; I hear Love's dirge in all the rills. Along the glory of the hills Flowers slope into a rim of gold: I hear Love's dirge in all the rills; Sad singings haunt me as of old. Flowers slope into a rim of gold Along the marges of the sky: Sad singings haunt me as of old; Shall Love come back to me to die? Along the marges of the sky The birds wing homeward from the East: Shall Love come back to me to die? Shall Hope relive, once having ceased? The birds wing homeward from the East; I smell spice-breaths upon the air: Shall Hope relive, once having ceased? Hope would lie black on my despair. I smell spice-breaths upon the air; The golden Orient-savours pass: Hope would lie black on my despair, Like a moon-shadow on the grass. The golden Orient-savours pass; The full Spring throbs in all the shade: Like a moon-shadow on the grass, My hope into the dusk would fade. The full Spring throbs in all the shade; We shall have roses soon, I trow; My hope into the dusk would fade; Bring lilies on Love's grave to strow. We shall have roses soon, I trow; Soon will the rich red poppies burn: Bring lilies on Love's grave to strow; My hope is fled beyond return. Soon will the rich red poppies burn; Soon will blue iris star the stream: My hope is fled beyond return; Have mine eyes tears for my waste dream? Soon will blue iris star the stream; Summer will turn the air to wine: Have mine eyes tears for my waste dream? Can songs come from these lips of mine? Summer will turn the air to wine. So full and sweet the mid-Spring flowers! Can songs come from these lips of mine? My thoughts are gray as winter-hours. So full and sweet the mid-Spring flowers? The wind brings up the hawthorn's breath. My thoughts are gray as winter-hours; My soul, my soul is sick to death. SONGS OF LIFE AND DEATH. DEDICATION TO RICHARD WAGNER. The “Dedication to Richard Wagner”, commenced in 1869 and completed in February 1872, was first printed in 1872, as a Prelude to the first Edition of my “Songs of Life and Death”, at a time when to avow oneself an enthusiastic admirer of the great German composer, (to say nothing of his equally great contemporaries and in part precursors, Berlioz and Liszt,) was to be popularly considered something like a malignant maniac. MASTER and chief of all for whom the singers Strain with full bosoms and ecstatic throats, For whom the strings beneath the flying fingers, The sackbuts and the clarions, yield their notes,— Lord over all for whom the tymbals thunder, For whom the harps throb like the distant sea, For whom the shrill sweet flutings cleave in sunder The surges of the strings that meet and flee,— O strong sweet soul, whose life is as a mountain Hymned round about with stress of spirit-choirs, Whose mighty song leaps sunward like a fountain, Reaching for lightnings from celestial fires,— O burning heart and tender, highest, mildest, Nightingale-throated, with the eagle's wing,— This sheaf of songs, culled where the ways are wildest And the shade deepest, to thy feet I bring. I hail thee as from many hearts that cherish, Serve and keep white thy thought within their shrines, Where the flame fades not, though its lustre perish, Midmost the lurid and the stormy signs. I greet thee as from those great mates departed Who first taught Song to know the ways of Soul, Fit harbingers of thee, the eagle-hearted, Saw in the art the new sun-planets roll. I greet thee with a promise and a cheering,— I, that have loved thee many weary years, I, that, with eyes strained for the dawn's appearing, Have clung to thee for hope and healing tears; I, that am nought, whose weakling voice has in it The shrill sole sadness of one wailing note; No nightingale I, but a sad-voiced linnet, Piping thin ditties from a bleeding throat; I—since the masters lift no voice to-thee-ward To stay thy battle in the weary time— Send forth for thee these weak-winged songs to seaward, To bear to thee their freight of idle rhyme. Ah, how weak-voiced and little worth, my master! Yet haply, as a lark-song on the breeze, That, winging through the air, black with disaster, Heartens some exile pacing by the seas, So even mine, my weak and unskilled singing May smite thine ear with no unpleasing notes, What time the shrill sounds of the fight are ringing About thee and the clamour of dull throats. And peradventure (for least love is grateful) The humble song may, for a little while, Smoothe from thy brow the sadness high and fateful, Call to thy lips the rare and tender smile. My harmonies are harmonies of sadness, My light is but as starlight on the wane: Far nobler bards shall cheer thee with their gladness; I bring thee but the song-pulse of my pain. Be not disheartened, O our Zoroaster, O mage of our new music-world of fire! Thou art not all unfriended, O my master! Let not the great heart fail thee for desire. What matter though the storm-wind round thee rages, Though men judge weakly with imperfect sight? O master-singer of the heroic ages, Each dawn is brighter with the appointed light. Hate's echoes on the inconstant air but languish, Win not within the world's true heart to be,— Faint wails for us of far-off souls in anguish, That chide their own sick selves in all they see. Thine is the Future—hardly theirs the Present, The flowerless days that put forth leaf and die— Theirs that lie steeped in idle days and pleasant, Letting the pageant of the years pass by. For the days hasten when shall all adore thee, All at thy spring shall drink and know it sweet; All the false temples shall fall down before thee, Ay, and the false gods crumble at thy feet. Then shall men set thee in their holy places, Hymn thee with anthems of remembering; Faiths shall spring up and blossom in thy traces, Thick as the violets cluster round the Spring. And then, perchance, when, in the brighter ages, Men shall awake and know the god they scorned And mad with grief, grave upon marble pages (That therewithal the Future may be warned) The tale of their remorse and shame undying, They, coming where thy name has kept these sweet, —These idle songs of mine,—shall set with sighing My name upon the marble at thy feet; For that, when all made mock of and denied thee, Seeing not the portent and the fiery sword, I, from my dream, in the mid-heaven descried thee, Saw and confessed thee, knew and named thee Lord. February 1872. A PRELUDE. WHAT shall my song be of these latter days, These darkened days of toil and weariness? Lo! for sheer burden of the grief that slays The adventure in men's hearts and for the stress Of doubt, my feet turn from the sunlit ways, My eyes drink darkness from the morning rays And my tongue curses where it fain would bless. Ah! who shall cure the sickness of the time? Who shall bring healing to the wounded age? Not I, forsooth. I—with my idle rhyme— Right gladly would I blazon all the page Of life with flowers and with the happy chime Of heart-free songs, lift up the folk to climb The peaks that soar out of the tempest's rage; Ah, how soul-gladly! But the life in me Is worn with doubt and agony and care: Fain would I lead: alas! I cannot see Myself the way. The presage in the air Weighs on my thought and will not set it free. Ah God! the helpless, saddened soul of me! How shall I sing glad songs of my despair? How shall I sing of aught but that I love? How should I be in love with aught but sleep? I, that have watched the morning mists remove And heaven break open to its grayest deep, Straining my eyes around me and above, Only to see the dreams that erst I wove Melt in the noonday, leaving me to weep! I, that thought once no ills should daunt my faith, That hope should pluck the laurel from the abyss, Can this be I of old, this world-worn wraith Of brighter days, living on memories And bitter food of dreams, in love with Death, Seeking no laurel but a cypress-wreath, Can this be I, with all my hopes grown this? Alas! the long gray years have vanquished me, The shadow of the inexorable days. I am grown sad and silent: for the sea Of Time has swallowed all my pleasant ways. I am grown weary of the years that flee And bring no light to set my bound hope free, No sun to fill the promise of old Mays. For, let the summer throne it as it will, Life and the sun are sad and sere to him (Sadder than Death and Night) who wearies still For his desire and sees upon the rim Of the pale sky no sign that shall fulfil The covenant of promise every rill, Each flower swore to him, whilst the dawn broke dim. How shall the sunlight thaw his wintry thought? His eyes look past the harvest and the throng Of flower-crowned hours, to where the peace long sought Lies on the fields and all the stress life-long Into the ice-calm woof of sleep is wrought: Needs must he wander, with void hope distraught, Measuring his sad life with a less sad song. A SONG BEFORE THE GATES OF DEATH. Sed satis est jam posse mori. SMITE strings and fill the courts with thy lament! Yea, let the singing thunder through the halls; Wake all the echoes from the funeral walls, From aisle to roof and porch to battlement! Give forth thy sorrow till the roses' scent Is blent for dole into the lilies' breath And all the air is faint with balms of death, Seeing the glory of the day is spent And Death treads very nigh upon our feet. Sing out and let the winds be filled with song! Haply, the clangours of the chant shall greet The great gods' senses, till the unheeding throng Immortal hear in it the thunderous beat Of Fate and tremble for remembered wrong. Give me the vase. Drink deep as for the dead! Drink Life and all its joys a long good-bye! Surely, the wine shall hearten us to die. Blood of the grape! Wine, that the earth has bled From her slit painful veins, living and red With all the deaths that have won life for thee! I pour thee out for sign and memory, For thanksgiving to life and goodlihead Of the green earth and all her friendly hours: The homage of the dead, that in her sods Shall soon lie low and rot beneath the showers Of the round year; yet, when the kind Fate nods, Mayhap shall glorify the grass in flowers: A godlike homage! For the dead are gods. The dead are gods, seeing they lie and sleep, Folded within the mantle of the night; Ay, more than gods! For lo! the heavy might Of Death enrounds them. Never do they weep Nor smile sad smiles nor strain against the sweep Of rugged Doom. There is no Fate for them, Lying, close-companied, within the hem Of the pale fateful god: the long years creep Over their heads and may not break their rest. Who would not choose to die, when life is worn And wan with wrong unto the utterest? The fierce gods chase us to the brink with scorn; Yet smite the strings! We are not so forlorn But we may die, seeing that death is best. Curse we the gods and die! Give me the lyre. Now, Zeus, fling thunders from thine armouries And Helios, rain down sunbolts from thy skies! We die and fear you not and all your ire, Impotent as the flaming of a fire Against the dead. There is no hope for us, Save of a sinking sweet and slumberous Into the arms of rest. Pile up the pyre! Great father Zeus, we reck not of thy grace: It is thy wrath we crave with our last breath. Look down in all thy terrors, King of Life! Consume us with the splendours of thy face! So shall the keen fire solve us from our strife And our sad souls be ravished unto death. FALSE SPRING. THE linnet tapped at the window-pane, The hawthorn shook down its silver rain, The flower-scents called me again and again: ‘Come, for the Spring is here!’ O linnet! the day is golden for thee; O hawthorn! thy snow is pleasant to see; O flowers! will the flower-scents waken for me The dreams that are dead and sere? ‘Come out, come out, O poet!’ they said; ‘The violets wait in their cool green bed, The windflowers beckon with silver head, The pale blue crocuses linger For thee, like a flame of the winter's end, The hyacinth-clusters tinkle and bend, The cowslips thrill with the scents they send To comfort the weary singer. ‘The earth is singing her songs of green; The cuckoo pipes in the heart of the treen; There is no sadness in any, I ween, Under the new Spring glamour. Come out and live with the flowers again! Thou hast fretted thy soul o'erlong in vain With the olden strife and the olden pain And the weary worldly clamour.’ ‘O breezes and birds!’ I said, ‘I fear Ye should bring me again the past-time drear And the vanished shapes that I held so dear, With their tender tearful grace. I fear ye should raise in the hawthorn-bowers The sad sweet wraiths of the bygone hours And sadden my sight in the primrose-flowers With a dear dead maiden's face.’ ‘O poet,’ they said, ‘the Spring is glad; The earth has buried the grief it had; The fields have forgotten the winter sad, The woods are laughing with blossom: There cometh no wraith of the bygone days To moan in the wreaths of the woodbine maze; But a golden glory of sunbeams plays Over the young land's bosom!’ ‘O birds! I fear ye will sing me anew The golden songs that I taught to you, When life was a kiss of the summer dew, Under the blossomed flowers. O breezes! I fear lest the voice of the dead Should ring in your wafts, with the words she said And the silver rain of the tears she shed, In the old sweet happy hours.’ ‘O poet!’ they said, ‘we will comfort thee, No more shall our voices deceitful be; We will sing to thee songs of the things we see In the happy future's gold! We will weave for thee delicate dreams and deep; We will vex thee no longer nor make thee weep; We will leave unstirred in their dreamless sleep The happy days of old!’ There was no nay; so out I went, Under the apples blossom-sprent; And the Springtime kissed me, as I came, With blue-bell breath and crocus-flame; The birds did wreathe the air with singing And on the breeze there came a ringing, A noise of silver bells and gold, From out the woodlands, as of old. My feet did turn toward the wood; And as I went, the hawthorns strewed White snow and rosy in my way And throstles piped from every spray. There seemed no dole in aught, nor guile: The happy earth was all a-smile With cowslip-gold and windflower-white; Spring held all things with its delight. So to the forest's edge I came And saw the brooklet, like a flame Of liquid silver, flow between Lush column-work of arching green; Fair flowers laughed archly in the moss; The daffodils their heads did toss For joyance and the gladsome bees Hummed in the blue anemones. There seemed no sadness in the air Nor any thought of things that were For me of old and are no more; Nor any of the sad old lore That in my heart the years laid deep, To lie and sleep a troubled sleep, Did seem to stir in that sweet shade; And so I entered, undismayed. O birds, 'twas not well done of you! O flowers and breeze, right well ye know The weary glamour that the Spring Had laid for me on everything! 'Twas but to bring me back again The memory of the olden pain, Ye lured me out, with song of birds, With violet-breath and fair false words! For lo! my feet had hardly past The woven band of flowerage, cast Betwixt the meadows and the trees, When, in the bird-songs and the breeze, Another strain was taken up And out of every blue-bell's cup, The mocking voices sang again The olden songs of love and pain. The flowers did mimic the old grace; The wan white windflowers wore her face And in the stream I heard her words; Her voice came rippling from the birds. Dead love, I saw thy form anew Bend down among the violets blue, And like a mist, the memory Of all the past rose up in me. HYMN TO THE NIGHT. O NIGHT, that holdest all the keys of dreams, Unfolding o'er the azure of the sea! I give thee welcome with a flowerful hand, For lo! I have been very fain for thee. I give thee loving welcome, for meseems Thou knowest well that I do love thee so And in return dost hold my homage dear And usest well to pour celestial balms Of comfort, that thy servant winds have fanned Together, on me from thy cool dusk palms And from the jewelled hollow of thy sphere, Brimmed with moon-pearl and silver of the stars. For often, when my heart was sore with scars Of striving and I could not weep for woe, Thine airs have brought sweet singings to mine ears And loosened all the silver springs of tears; Thy hands have soothed the fierceness from my grief And in thy robe's wide purple thou hast drawn And folded all my sorrows, while the sills Of heaven dropped sapphire. So I had relief Of sadness, ere the primrose of the Dawn Budded pale gold upon the emerald hills. Thou knowest I have ever been to thee, Fair, simple Night, full constant in my love, How I have cherished, all delights above, The folding of thy pinions over me. Mine has been no ephemeral fantasy, That loves and loves not in one short hour's span And knows not if Day's rose have sweeter breath Than thine own violets. Ere the noon began To burden all the air with weary gold And doom all wandering winds to fiery death, My spirit to thy sheltering arms did flee. Ere yet the chariot of the sunset rolled Fierce to the dying as an ancient knight And many a mist grew painted o'er the sea, I saw thee in the haze, with silent feet, Sweep o'er the distance, Mother of the Night, Wrapping the hills in shadow, fold on fold: I saw thy vans across the landscape meet And my faint soul arose to welcome thee. My faint soul sinks into thy windless deeps, Misted with gold, O Mother of the Dreams! And gazes with a wonderless content, Up through thy lymph, to where the azure floors Of heaven are with a gradual glory rent, That through the cloisters of the æther leaps And in thy lap its spreading splendours pours, In flood on flood of golden-crested streams. For slow sweet wonders lie for me impearled Within thy womb and in thy jewelled sands; And all the lute-strings of my soul are swept, By the unfolding ripples of thy tide And rhythmic pulsing of thy tender hands, To melodies of some enchanted world, That through the ardour of the day has slept And will not glimmer through its veiling groves Of tender mystery, till the Night divide The gates of slumber: songs of half-felt bliss And dreams, through which a strange sweet echo roves And murmurs in a mist of fragrances And all sound's sweets do wane and swell and kiss, Like night-birds in the blossomed oranges. My faint eyes loathe the ardours of the noon And fiery splendours of the dying sun; Joys that are stretched to madness, love that burns And fierce delights that weary, scarce begun. The roses wound me with their passionate bloom; I weary of the lilies' laden breath; And all the flowerage of my yearning turns Toward its pearlèd lodestar of the moon And tarries for thy grave and kindly gloom, O thronèd Night! to soothe the hot fierce blue Of heaven with its webs of amethyst; My sad soul listens for thine airs to bring Soft harmonies and low to me and sing Sweet songs of thee and of thy shadow Death And strains to see thy woven hands of mist The meadows of the upper æther strew With fair and tender lavishment of flowers And sow thick goldcups in the purple meads, Far dearer than the gay and flaunting weeds That drink the sunlight in the noontide hours. MADRIGAL TRISTE. IF we should meet, You and I, My sweet, In some fair land where under the blue sky The scents of the fresh violets never die And Spring is deathless under deathless feet, Should we clasp hands and kiss, My sweet, With the old bliss? Would our eyes meet With the same passionate frankness as of old, When the fresh Spring was in the Summer's gold? Ah, no! my dear. Woe's me! our kisses are but frore; The blossoms of our early love are sere And will be fresh no more. If we should stand, You and I, My sweet, On that bright strand Where day fades never and the golden street Rings to the music of the angels' feet, Would our rent hearts find solace in the sky? Should we lose heed, My dear, Of the sad years? Would our souls cease to bleed For the past anguish and our eyes grow clear, In heaven, from all the furrows of the tears? Ah, no! my dear. Needs must we sigh and stand aloof. Once riven, God could not heal our love, Even in heaven. A SONG OF ROSES. MANY a time and oft, In the July weather, When the breeze was soft And the pleasant land Purple with the heather, Went we hand in hand, Love and I together. Round our happy feet Twinkled out the roses, Roses red and sweet, Ruddy as the sky When the dawn uncloses, White as chastity, Yellow as primroses. Were the roses red, Lo! my love was brighter. Did the moonlight shed Lilies on the ground, Lo! my love was whiter And her footsteps' sound Than the breeze was lighter. God! how glad we were! All the birds were jealous. Hovering in the air, All the larks and linnets, All the white-breast swallows, Envied all our minutes More than they could tell us. Thrushes knew no song Like thy golden singing: In the woodbirds' throng There was no such sweetness As thy voice's ringing And thy footsteps' fleetness O'er the heather springing. Heavens! how we kissed! Flowers to one another Bending through the mist Of the summer-calm, Kissing each his brother, With their breath of balm, Filled not one the other With such golden bliss, With such tender glory Prisoned in a kiss; All the sweet Spring-gladness, All the summer-story And the autumn-sadness, When the sky is hoary. Through the harebells blue Went the bees a-humming, Singing of the dew, Of the summer ceased And the harvest coming And the honey-feast In the winter-gloaming. Flower-dew, like the bee, From thy lips so bonny, 'Gainst the flower-time flee, Stole I in Love's name, While July was sunny, That, when winter came, I too might have honey. Roses red and white In my breast I treasured, Whilst the sky was bright And the fragrant ways With the flowers were measured, That in autumn's days I might be rose-pleasured. On my happy breast Didst thou weep for gladness; And thy tears, out-prest, Falling on the roses, Filled them with strange sadness, Sweet as birdsong-closes, In the new May-madness. Then I learnt the song That thy lips did utter; Caught each jewelled throng, Every glad clear trill, Every low sweet mutter, At thy voice's will That did fly and flutter; Treasured every note In my heart's recesses, Learnt them all by rote, All the golden falls, All the silver stresses, All the joy that thralls, All the love that blesses; Stored them dearly up In the hidden places, In the white closed cup Of my flower-bell fancies; That, when white earth's face is And the old romances Gone with summer's graces, When my soul should grope In the earth-mists sordid, Far from love and hope, I might turn for balm To the music hoarded And in its sweet psalm Hope and be rewarded. So the summer fled And the autumn mellowed All the leaves to red, All the corn to gold; And the winter followed, With its silent cold And its snows wind-hollowed. Then I went alone; For light Love had left me, When the birds had flown And the flowers were dead: Winter had bereft me Of the roses red And the bliss Love weft me. Then I said, “Have heart! Thou hast yet thy treasure. Though light Love depart, Thou canst summon up All the summer leisure From its silver cup, All the bygone pleasure.” So I searched my heart For the hoarded sweetness, Honey set apart 'Gainst the days of sadness; For the songs whose fleetness Gave the summer gladness, Gave my bliss completeness. Lo! the songs were wails, Like the wind that surges Through the moaning sails. Lo! the sweets were gall. Lo! the thoughts were scourges, Bitter honey all; And the pæans dirges. Then from out my breast Did I take the roses, Roses tear-caressed, Roses red and white, That in the reposes Of the noon-delight I had plucked for posies. Lo! the flowers were dead, By the frost invaded; But the tears she shed Had, within the fronds Of the petals shaded, Grown to diamonds, Lights that never faded. So Love's gladness flees And its sweets wax bitter; But the memories Of its hours of sorrow, Holier and fitter, On the winter morrow, Turn to gems and glitter. A FAREWELL. TO part in midmost summer of our love, When first the flower-scents and the linnets' tune Have fallen into harmonies of June About our lives new linked and all above The flower-blue heaven lies for bliss aswoon,— Were this not sad? Yet love must live by pain, If one would win its fragrance to remain. Were it not sadder, in the years to come, To feel the hand-clasp slacken for long use, The untuned heartstrings for long stress refuse To yield old harmonies, the songs grow dumb For weariness and all the old spells lose The first enchantment? Yet this thing must be. Love is but mortal, save in memory. Too rare a flower it is, its bloom to keep In the raw cold of our unlovely clime, Too frail to thrive in this our weary time. I would not have thy kisses, sweet, grow cheap Nor thy dear looks round out an idle rhyme; And so I hold that we loose hands and part. Dear, with my hand you do not loose my heart. Sweet is the fragrance of remembered love; The memory of clasped hands is very sweet, Joined lips that did not once too often meet And never knew that saddest word ‘Enough!’ And so 'tis well that, ere our Springtime fleet, Thus in the heyday of our love part we: Farewell, and all white omens go with thee! Is it not well that we should both retain The early bloom of love, untouched and pure? There is no way by which it may endure, Save if we part before its sweetness wane And wither; since that life is so impure And love so frail, it may not blossom long, Unscathed, in this our stress of care and wrong. We were not sure of love, my sweet,—and yet The fragrance of its Spring shall never die. Sweetheart, we shall be sure of memory, That amber of the years, where Time doth set The dear-belovèd shapes of things gone by, That so their gentle semblance may evade The ills that lurk in eld's ungenial shade. So, sweet, our love shall, in the death of it, Relive, as corn that withers in the ground, Yet with fresh blades doth presently abound And yields full golden sheavage in time fit. It may be that new flowers will too be found Among the stubble and the pale sweet blooms Of Autumn glorify our woodland glooms. The memory of our kisses shall survive And in Time's treasure-house be consecrate. Our love shall with the distance grow more great And shall for us be sweeter than alive, When dead; for memory shall reduplicate The sweetness of the past, till you and I Cherish as angels' food each bygone sigh. AUBADE. WHEN the flocks of the morning gather in the East, Golden-fleeced, And the star-sparkles of the night are drawn Into one great orient pearl of dawn, The voice of my soul is as a bird that mourns Because the night has ceased. My voice is as a sorrowful sweet singing, That murmurs o'er dim notes of faded morns, Thick-misted with pale memories round them clinging, Whose faint fresh bud of dawning did unfold Into the noonday's burning flower of gold; And all the cloisters of the air are ringing With dreams of things that have been done and told For me in days of old. Amber of dawn, thou bringest me scant pleasure; Sad treasure Of fair and precious jewels that the years Have worn and dulled with bitter rills of tears. Thy gold is as the wraith of bygone hope Poured without measure Upon the upland meadows of my youth, When Edens glittered on each cloudward slope And all the sweet old lies seemed fairest sooth, When all things wore the tender glow of dreaming. (Alas! that such sweet error should have blown To seeding and such bitter fruit have sown!) Ah me! meseems the halls of heaven are streaming With many a sweet old memory that has flown And left me sad and lone. Time was, the dawnflower, on the hills unfolding, To me, beholding Brought visions of a fair and far ideal And seemed the chalice of a new Sangreal. I dreamt that I might win life's balm and bid My fellows to the holding Of the banquet of a new and nobler being, Wherefrom old glooms and horrors should be rid And no one eye should be shut out from seeing; Where the despairing soul of man, grown faithful To its own self, should find life no more scathful With weary doubt and thrice accursèd ease And the enfranchised air no more be wraithful With phantoms of time-honoured wrong, that freeze The speech in him that sees,— Sees and is sick to vent his soul in singing, That the song, ringing Athwart the wild waste beauty of the world, May free it from the dragons that lie curled Round its sad heart, back, to the glory golden Of old, Earth's deserts bringing,— And may not work his will for damnèd use. I dreamt that I might bring the unbeholden Fear, that doth steep with such a venomed juice The cup of being, to the light of dawn And show it powerless; and that curse withdrawn, Life should bloom fresh and fair with healthful dews. This was my dream, O amber of the dawn, In days long since bygone. Lo! I have fought and perished in the striving; Lo! and arriving Before my goal of crystal and of gold, Have seen its glories shrink off, fold by fold, Leaving the bare waste hopelessness exposed. I have grown sick with riving, Mist after mist, the opals of the mirage, That for my sight, blinded with dreams, enclosed The prize of some new hero-high aspirage, Gold to be won by who should dare the winning, Who should cast off and leave in the beginning The cumber of the fatal Past's empirage And to old signs a new rich meaning giving, Through death and sin win living! Lo! I have failed and fallen in the gaining. In the attaining Life, has Death entered deep into my soul. Lo! I have sunk defeated at the goal. Eos, thy banners of the triumph, streaming Over the pale night's waning, Are wraiths to me of old deceptive glory, Gold of the victory of the darkness, gleaming Over the hills with pennants red and gory. For me, thy downward heaven-reddening flood Is as the river of the flush of blood That hearts of men have shed for thy false story, Since day first glittered on the new-born world, Sun-crowned and iris-pearled. Long to my sight the night has been the fairer, The bearer Of comfort to the souls of those that languish With hopeless hope and weary with the anguish Of saddening joy: the glamour of the setting Sweeter and rarer,— In the faint sadness of its purple fading Toward the silver night and her forgetting, Where there is only balm and no upbraiding,— Is to my soul, that wearies for reposing, More grateful than dawn-Daphne's fierce unclosing, Wherein for aye I see old hopes evading My grasp, and with a mocking light regilded, Waste dreams my young hands builded. COURANTE. SILVER Spring; Hawthorn-white, Violet-scent, May-delight; Birds that sing Noon and night, Meadows sprent With sunlight; Woods that ring With the pent Streams that twine In their flight Shade and shine: Whose content Do they bring? Whose delight? Ah, not mine! Gold of June; Days afire With flower-flush Of desire: Sun-sprent noon, Hedge and brier Rose a-blush High and higher; Linnet's tune, Trill of thrush, Nightingales In the hush Of the moon: What avails All the flush Of the grass, All the rush Of the hours, That o'erpass Earth and sea, Crowned with flowers, Unto me? What, alas? Light of Love; Lips that cling, Hands that meet, Souls that wing Heavens above, Wandering, Joined and sweet; Thoughts that sing, Lives that move To the beat Of the hours, Murmuring, “Heaven is ours, Ours that love, While we twine Hand in hand, In the shine Of Love's land;” Whose glad feet Tread that strand, All divine? Whose blest hand Gathers flowers In Love's land? Ah, not mine! Who complains? Ah, not I! Not a tear, Not a cry. All the rains Of the sky Cannot clear Souls that sigh Of their stains: But I lie Many a year, Grief-opprest, And the pains In my breast Never rest, Never die. THE DEAD MASTER. A THRENODY. “The Dead Master” in question was Walter Savage Landor, whose “Hellenics” were the delight of my youth. Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus Tam cari capitis? WAST thou not with us, when the night departed, O strong sweet singer that art ours no more! Was not the harping thine that first gave o'er The song of wailing, when the daybreak parted And the glad heavens broke open, shore from shore, Sun-crowned and iris-hearted? Didst thou not smite the strings to jubilation, Hymning the grand sweet scope of the To-be? Did not our midnight dole and doubting flee From thy glad strength and all our lamentation Swell with thy song into an ecstasy Of aspiration? No more we wept and wailed for Life's undoing, Following the golden notes that brake from thee, Riding star-crowned upon that sudden sea Which from thy soul poured forth for our renewing Oceans of hope and jubilance, that we Drank of, ensuing. Didst thou not rend for us the gloom descending, Scatter the veils of doubting from our sight, Bring to our lives again the flower-delight, Bird-songs and field-scents in thy verses blending? Didst thou not save our spirits from the night Stern and impending? Lo! and the night has bound thee, O our master! Lo! and the shadows gather round thy place! Shall we then no more look upon thy face? Surely the shades will fold to night the faster. Surely Death's torches quicklier replace Life's lamp of alabaster. Shall we then no more see thee, O our singer, Passing the love of women to our souls? Shall then our lives be darkened and our goals Deep in the gray dim distance fade and linger, Since that no more thy voice our steps controls, No more thy finger Points and is clear along the hills that darken, Clear with the distant glimmer of the day? Will then the cliff-walls never roll away, That thy song's sweetness hide from us that hearken, Us that are weary in Life's mazèd way, Weary of mists that starken? Have we then heard thy singing for the last time Shape us the glories of the olden days? Have we a last time listened to the lays, Wherein thou scaledst the ancient heavens for pastime And in the future's iridescent haze Buildedst the past-time? Can we forget thee, high sweet soul and faithful, Homer and Pindar of our modern time, Lord of our thought and leader of our rhyme, Thou that didst clear the air that was so deathful, Filled it anew with scents of rose and thyme, Made it bird-breathful? Thou that for us wast some sublime Silenus, Full to the lips of wise and lovely words, Shaping to song the speech of flowers and birds, Wast as a god on whose strength we might lean us, And, our Apollo, piped to us thy herds Songs of Camœnus! What doth it irk us if we never saw thee, Knew but thy presence as a god's afar, Heard but thy song as music of a star? Were we not with thee, part in thee and of thee? Were not our souls akin to thine and are? Did we not love thee? With thee we lived in some enchanted Arden, Glad with the echo of the wood-nymphs' feet, Bright with old memories, very strange and sweet, That in the shade of that Armida's garden Did from our cold pale daylight hide and fleet, Where all things harden. Thou wast no wailer, no sweet-voiced unmanner, That for weak men within an idle clime Builded vain dreams to sweet and idle rhyme: Thou hast built souls after the antique manner, Souls that shall march through many a lapse of time, Bearing thy banner, Thy standard with its burden high and golden, Daring to love and loving, know no shame, Wit to reject the let of age-old blame, Faith to rekindle altar-ashes olden, Fan the old love of Nature to full flame, Long unbeholden. Friend, we have mourned and longed for thee with mourning; Poet, our ears are sad with listening, Straining for songs no breeze shall ever bring; Master, thy lapse has dulled with dusk Life's morning, Dimmed with black death each bright and lovely thing, That in the adorning Of thy high verse had erst been wont to sparkle, Glitter and glow with glories of the past; Spirit of song and flame of faith, the blast Of thine eclipse has reft from us, anarchal, Robbed us with thee of all the things thou wast, Bard patriarchal! Master, in vain we listen for thy singing, Listen and long and languish for desire! Unto our ears no echoes of thy lyre Pulse from the darkness, no glad breeze comes bringing Voices, no sparkles of the ancient fire Reach us, wide-winging. Will then thy song no more translate our yearning, Mould our harsh cries to music of the spheres? Will thy verse glitter no more with our tears? Has then the sun of thy bright soul, whose burning Lightened so oft the midnight of our fears, Set, unreturning? Or hast thou found thy dream in plains supernal, Shapes of fair women, forms of noble men, That, at the magic summons of thy pen, Did, from the snows and solitudes hybernal, Where they so long had slept, seek out again The meadows vernal? Do the long lapses of the ghost-land, lying Stretched out beyond the portals of the grave, Teem with fresh fruits and flowers for thee and wave With the clear shapes of thine old dreams undying? Has the dark flood been powerful to lave From thy soul sighing, Grief and the very memory of grieving, Hope and the very thought of wearying After the glow and glory thou didst sing? Hast in the air such unimagined giving, Splendour and flush of every godlike thing, Wherefor thy living Struggled and wearied in the bitter days? Dost thou live out thy phantasies of gold Under Greek skies and Attic woods of old, Walk, crowned with myrtle, in the Dorian ways, Peopled with all the dreams that did unfold In thy high lays? Surely, this thing alone could hold thee speechless, Surely, in this alone couldst thou forget Us that are left to struggle in the net Of the sad world, to feel the days grow each less Sweet to our souls, to weary with the fret, Dumb and beseechless. Surely, thy soul would yearn to us with longing: Surely, no grave could keep thy voice from us, Were not this so. The silence dolorous Surely is voiceful of the years prolonging Long bliss for thee and us to come, that thus Unto the thronging, Unto the cry and clamour of our yearning, Still is the air and stirless is the light, That from the grey grim bosom of the night Comes back no sign or voice of thy returning, Echoes no memory of the old delight, Weariness spurning! Well, be it so; mayhap, some day, unknowing, We too shall rest and come to where thou art, Press thee again full-raptured to our heart, Gaze in thine eyes with eyes no less fire-glowing And in like bliss forget the olden smart, The weary going Friendless and dumb about the ways of being, Cast off the memory of the years we sighed After thy song and presence sunny-eyed, In the new splendour of thy lays, the seeing All the old hopes fulfilled and sanctified, No longer fleeing Mirage-like from us through the earthly hazes; Haply we too shall leave our olden pains Off with our life and all its weary stains, Put on like joy amid the light that blazes There, the glad day that floods those golden plains, Those songful mazes! Till then, farewell! The joy shall be the greater When we clasp hands and hearts to part no more: For that the long lone life has been so sore, For that no sign of thee to death played traitor, Sharper shall be the bliss for us in store, Sweeter if later. VOCATION SONG. ‘La poésie est semblable à l'amandier: ses fleurs sont parfumées et ses fruits sont amers.’ Louis Bertrand, Gaspard de la Nuit. LORD, what unto Thy servants shall be given, That have so long, in pain and doubt and strife, For Thee with hand and heart and song hard striven, What time Thou givest out the crowns of life? What time the lances of the light are driven Athwart the gloom that holds Life's holiest throne, What time the curtains of the mist are riven, What time the trumpets of the dawn are blown? We, who to tunes of love and light, unknowing, Have chastened all the jarring chords of life,— We, who, with lips with milk and honey flowing, Have fed on galls of bitterness and strife,— We do not ask of Thee, as this our guerdon, To live a shining life among Thy blest; 'Twould be for us but shifting of our burden, Not the fulfilment of the longed-for rest. We have no kin with those uplifted faces, Those ordered minstrels that before Thee bow, Set rank on rank upon the holy places, With stiff sharp laurel fringing every brow. For us, no balms of Heaven could stay our yearning, No crown of woven lilies and pale palms, No City with eternal glory burning, Set in the golden stress of ceaseless psalms. Our souls are weary with the stress of seeing, Wasted with burning thoughts that throb and throng, Worn with the straining ecstasy of Being, That passes through our heart-strings into song. Our lives are sick with seeing all things' sadness, Sad earth beneath us and sad heaven above; Life's sweets to us are but as herbs of madness, Sweet poison of the bitter bliss of Love. Our souls are weary of the changing courses, The sick alternative of smiles and tears, Are weary of the unrelenting forces, Are weary of the burden of the years; The burden of the winds in river-sedges, The burden of the torrents and the sea, The burden of the woodbirds in the hedges: ‘Time is, Time was and Time will cease to be!’ Is it as nothing that the same flame courses Athwart Thy veins that riots in our own? Is it as nothing that the selfsame sources Of light and life to us as Thee are known? Shall we 'scape smiting with the 'scape of breath? Shall we aye rest from bitter song's fierce smarts? Will not the song-stress thrill the brain of death? Will not the song-pulse throb in our cold hearts? Lord God, wilt Thou not help us, that have striven To do Thy work so hardly and so long? Wilt Thou not give us rest from Thy high heaven And peace from bitter weaving of sweet song? Save us, O Lord, before the fire consume us, Ere the hot chrism shrivel body and soul! Let the soft arms of some sweet death entomb us And hold us fast from love and joy and dole! SUNDOWN. I KNOW not whence it was, nor how it came, That I should dream again the sad old dream, That the recurrent years should bear the same Sun-brightened bubbles to my life's dull stream. So sad and sweet it was, both life and death Did mingle in the perfume of its flowers; It was compounded of the Spring's sweet breath And of the gusty winter's snow-white hours. The tender cadence of the soft May-wind Fanned lovingly the misty winter air; The old enchanted Mährchen-blooms combined With chill frost-flowers to make it sad and fair. Armida's garden was it for my feet, Its air with magical delights was rife: 'Twas death to me, and yet so living sweet, I welcomed death that was more fair than life. ‘Surely, the bitterness of death is past!’ I said, when once that weary dream was o'er; ‘Surely, the corpse of memory at last Will rest in peace and trouble me no more!’ And so I buried sadly my dead love, Laid it to sleep beneath the sands of Time. It was no phœnix, but a wounded dove, (I thought,) and would live only in my rhyme. Alas! God's essence could not lightly die! Its life was quickened by no mortal breath; It rose again and filled my life's gray sky With all the cold wan loveliness of death. This phantom is it, whose persistence mars The tender beauty of the summer hours, Whose image blots from me the kindling stars And saddens all the splendour of the flowers. The months slid swiftly down the year's decline, The flowers went drooping to their autumn tomb; The dying leaves did, dolphin-like, outshine With gold and red the summer's lavish bloom. Springtide and summer did my grief assain With primrose-blooms and rose-embalsamed air; With dying summer seemed to die my pain And for awhile the cruel foe did spare. But all too soon I found the ancient fire Slept only 'neath the rose and jasmine blooms: It needed but a breath of dead desire To stir old memories in their flowery tombs. For one light flower-touch of thy white white hand, One glance from out thy blue blue eye again, Could call the dead Spring from the shadow-land And bid relive for me the vanished pain. Ah me, Madonna! we too have our hearts, (Strange, seems it not?) and lose them sometimes, too! Ay, and they break too, spite of all our arts! ‘'Tis true, 'tis pity! Pity 'tis, 'tis true!’ If I should say in earnest what in jest So oft I've told you in an idle song, Would you not treat it lightly as the rest And deem it fancy? Yet you would be wrong; For it is true, my sweet, as God is true, I have no heart, no soul, that is not thine: For it is true, as that the heavens are blue, My heart's blood throbbed within the passionate line. If stars give light, my love is star and moon; If June bear roses, love is my heart's June. If life be sleep and love the balm of death And faith and beauty be but hour-long dreams; If hoping faint, as faints the night-flowers' breath, And pass away upon the years' cold streams; If dreams be ghast with long-dead hopes and fears And pale sad phantasms dim the glass of time; If the unceasing rivulet of the years Run no more lucent with the gold of rhyme; If all Spring-blooms be chalices of woe And all June-sweets with winter's breath be rife, Ice-flowers shall mock for me the summer's glow; If Love be Death, then Death shall be my life: Sweet Death, sweet enemy, welcome to my breast; For, pressing thee, I see, beyond thee, rest. It is the old complaint we rhymers bear— Half-known in heaven, wholly strange to earth— The banquets of the Immortals now to share And now to wake unto our mortal dearth. Our souls a twofold burden must sustain; And so, although we have no twofold joy, Our double life is marred with double pain, Our brightest hopes are dulled with earth's alloy. We must have both—both love and fame—and strive The golden chariot of the god of Day Along the star-emblazoned track to drive, With one immortal steed and one of clay. Poor Phaëtons! no wonder that we fail, Who would alike in earth and heaven prevail! O tender beauty of the fleeting years, O gilding glory of the sweet sad Past, God's most effectual healing, that endears To us our bitterest memories at last! O exquisite strange magic, by whose powers We live in an immortal wonderland, Framed in the mist-screen of the fading hours, A golden image in a mould of sand! The memory of past loving gilds our lives; New flower-times blossom from the brief annoy; The olden beauty through a mist revives, A faint sweet image of the ancient joy. The fitful sunheat of the youthful sky Mellows to sweetness as the years go by. I would not have that love of ours revive, (If I could backward tread the years again,) Much as I prized it: life could scarce survive A second access of the old sweet pain. I would not, if I could; and in this strife I cannot; for our man's heart has but room For one short life: and Love itself is life And can have but one summer and one bloom. Is it so short, this love and life of ours? Short in its sweetness, in its sadness long; And yet we find, among its fleeting hours, Some that are perfect as a linnet's song. Dear, it was brief and left the sweeter peace: The thought of true love lives, though loving cease. SHADOW-SOUL. ‘Destiné à n'avoir que le songe de mon existence, pour moi je ne prétends pas vivre, mais seulement regarder la vie. . . . . Des jours pleins de tristesse, l'habitude rêveuse d'une âme comprimée, les longs ennuis qui perpétuent le sentiment du néant de la vie.’ —Senancourt. ‘On m'a demandé, “Pourquoi pleurez-vous?” Et quand je l'ai dit, nul n'a pleuré, parce que l'on ne me comprenoit point. . . . . Je soupire parce que la vie n'est pas venue jusqu'à moi.’ — Lamennais. THERE is a tale of days of old Of how a man, by sorcery, Wrought to defeat the spells that hold The soul in bonds and spirit-free, At will to wander, naked-souled, About the earth and air and sea. Long thus he went (the legend says) Until at length a counter-spell, Flung out upon the worldly ways From some abysmal crack of hell, Seized on him and, for all his days, Doomed him to walk invisible; Doomed him to pass among the things Of life, its joy and strife and dole, Note all men's hopes and wearyings, Feel all their tides beside him roll, Yet have in all no communings, But walk a lone, unfriended soul. So oftentimes to me it seems As if some sad enchantment laid Upon my life its hand, that teems With many-mingling spells of shade, And walled me in a web of dreams, Shut out and sole from human aid. For life has nought to do with me; I stand and watch its pageant pass, Stream by with pomp and blazonry Of many goodly things. Alas! Before my gaze its glories flee, Like moon-motes on a dream-lake's glass. Life's guerdons melt beneath my hands; Its sweets fade from me like a mist: I see folk conquer in the lands; I know men crowned for what I missed; I see my barren gray life-sands Yield to them gold and amethyst. My life is such a shadow-thing,— So all unmixed with other lives, With all men's joy and suffering And all the aims for which life strives,— I think sometimes each hour must bring The nothingness whence it derives. For men pass by me through the air, Hot with bright stress of eager aims Or furrowed with a sordid care, Seeking sweet ease or blazoned names; Glance at me with a passing stare And vanish from me like swift flames. My soul is like a wandering light Born of marsh-solitudes and lost, A hollow flame of heatless white, Among a ruddy lifewarm host Of living fires,—that may unite With none, a solitary ghost. My voice is like the voice of woods, When the wind shrills between the pines; An echo of sad Autumn moods, Wherein the listening ear divines A tale of endless solitudes, Dim vistas stretched in shadowy lines. My eyes are like some lake of dun, Hid in the shadow of the hills; Where all around, by day, the sun Shines nor may pass athwart its sills Of firs, but, when the day is done, The white moon all the silence fills. I gaze around me as I go, A pale leaf drifting down the stream; Men's lives flit by me on the flow, Made dark or bright with shade or gleam: For me, I feel them not, nor know; Life passes by me like a dream. I wander with sad yearning eyes And heart a-longing for the lost, (Known but in some dream-Paradise): And ever as my way is crossed By folk, my sad soul shrinks and flies, Among live men a sighing ghost. My feet love well to haunt the meads And wander where the thrush is loud; And yet some sad enchantment leads Me aye among the busy crowd And with bent head, my life proceeds, Where the smoke hovers like a cloud. And as I wander, once-a-while I turn to gaze on folk gone by, That seem to me not wholly vile, Having some kindred in their eye: They pass me mutely, and I smile And my heart pulses like to die. My heart feeds on its own desire: The flowers that blossom in my breast Blow out to frail life and expire, Unknown, unloved and uncaressed; And the pale phantom-haunted fire Burns inward aye of my unrest. I see twinned lovers, hand in hand, Walk in the shadow of the trees; Across the gold floor of the sand Life passes by with melodies: Alone upon the brink I stand And hear the murmur of the seas. I see afar full many a maid Walk, musing of the love to come; But, as I near them, in the shade Of my sad eyes they read my doom Of lonely life and fly afraid And leave me silent in my gloom. None may take hold upon my soul: No spirit flies from men to me; Billows of dreams between us roll, Waves spreading out to a great sea: Neither in gladness nor in dole Can our desires conjoinèd be. I have no heart in their delight; My aim has nothing of their aim; And yet the same flowers soothe our sight; The air that rounds us is the same; The same moon haunts our ways by night; The same sun rises like a flame. But over me a charm is cast, A spell of flowers and fate and fire; My hands stretch out through wastes more vast, My dreams from deeper deeps aspire: Life throbs around me, like a blast That sweeps the courses of a lyre. The merest unregarded thing, Dropped into this my solitude, Fills all my soul with echoing Of dreams, as in some haunted wood A pebble's plash into a spring Is by the circling air renewed. And yet there stirs a great desire For human aid within my breast; Men's doings haunt me like a fire, My heart throbs loud with their unrest; And now and then, as hope draws nigher, My soul leaps to them, unrepressed. For, though my feet in silence move Alone across this waste of hours, My heart strains hopeward like a dove, My soul bursts out in passion-flowers; My life brims o'er with a great love, Alone in this wide world of ours. My full soul quivers with a tide Of songs; my head heaves with a hum Of golden words, that shall divide The dusk and bid the full light come. Alas! men pass me, careless-eyed; And still my lips are cold and dumb. I go beneath the moon at night, Along the grey deserted streets; My heart yearns out in the wan light, A new hope pulses in its beats; Meseems that in the radiance white My soul a like pale spirit meets; As if the trance of the sad star Were the mute passion of some spright, That (like my own) some Fate did bar From all Life's fruits of dear delight; Some soul that aye must mourn afar And never with its love unite. Then doth my heart in blossoms ope; A new sweet music sweeps along The courses of my soul; the scope Of heaven is peopled with a throng Of long-pent thoughts and all my hope Pours forth into a flood of song. Bytimes, too, as I walk alone, The mists roll up before my eyes And unto me strange lights are shown And many a dream of sapphire skies; The world and all its cares are gone; I walk awhile in Paradise. But, in the day unfolded clear, When the fresh life is all begun, My soul into the old sad sphere Falls off; my dull feet seem to shun Once more the daylight and I fear To face the frankness of the sun. Alone and dumb, my heart yearns sore; I am nigh worn with waste desire: I stand upon a rocky shore, Watch life and love sail nigh and nigher; Then all pass by for evermore And leave me by my last hope's pyre. And yet I grieve not nor complain; The time for me has long gone by, When I could half assuage my pain By giving it delivery: My grief within my breast has lain Unspoken and my eyes are dry. I am confirmed in this my fate; I lock my love within my breast Nor look to find my soul a mate Nor match with hope my hope unblest: I am content to watch and wait, Impassible in my unrest. Long have I ceased the idle stress Toward the rending of my gloom: I am made whole in loneliness; I lay no blame on this my doom; I curse not, if I do not bless: My life is silent as the tomb. And yet (methinks) some day of days, The silence, that doth wrap me round, Shall at its heart of soundless ways With some faint echoing resound Of my own heart-cry and the rays Of a like light in it be found. Haply, one day these songs of mine Some world-worn mortal shall console With savour of the bitter wine Of tears crushed out from a man's dole; And he shall say, tears in his eyne, There was great love in this man's soul! Ay, bitter crushed-out wine of love, Pressed out upon his every word; A note as of some sad-voiced dove, As of some white unfriended bird, Dwelling alone in some dim grove, Whose song no man hath ever heard; But only the pale trackless sea And the clear trances of the moon Have quivered to his melody; And for the rapture of the tune, Their attributes, sad sanctity And peace, they gave to him for boon; So that his sadness, in the womb Of the mild piteous years, has grown A holy thing; and from the tomb, Where in the shade he lies alone, (As was in life his lonely doom) The seed of his desire has blown Into a flower above his grave, Full of most fair and holy scent; Most powerful and sweet to save And to heal men from dreariment. And I shall turn me in my grave And fall to sleep again, content. A BIRTHDAY SONG. WHAT shall I say to my dearest dear, On the sweetest day of the whole sweet year? Shall I tell her how dainty she is and sweet, From her golden head to her silver feet? Love of my loves, shall I say to her— Till the breeze catch tune and the birds repeat The chime of my song—thou art bright and rare, (Eyes of the gray and amber hair) Who is so white as my love, my sweet? Who is so sweet and fair? Ah, no! for my song would faint and die, Faint with a moan and a happy sigh, For a kiss of her lips so clear and red, For a touch of her dainty gold-wrought head And a look of her tender eye! And even the words, if words there were said, Would fail for the sound of her lovely name, Till the very birds should flout them to shame, That they strove to render silver with lead, To image with snow the flame! So e'en I must sing her over again The old old song with its one refrain, The song that in Spring like the cooing dove Has nothing for burden but just ‘I love.’ Go, O my songs, like a silver rain, And flutter her golden head above; Sing in her walks and her happy day, Fill all her dreams with the roundelay, ‘I love’ and ‘I love her,’ again and again, ‘I love her,’ sorry or gay! Is she thinking of me, my lady of love? (Heart of my heart, is the day enough For the thought and the wish of her daintiness And the memory of the last caress?) Do her lips seek mine, my gold-plumaged dove— My little lady with glass-gray eyne— In long sweet dreams of the night to press From the grapes of delight Love's golden wine? Does thought seem more and the world seem less, As her hand strays, seeking mine? Fly to her, fly, O my little song! (Fly to her quickly; the way is long And your little dove-coloured wings are weak.) Nestle your head on her roseleaf cheek; Say what I would, if my wings were strong And the heaven were near to seek: Take all the tender fancies that lie And flower in my heart so silently; Sing her the love I can never speak Wholly, but in a sigh! IN THE NIGHT-WATCHES. ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth.’ Ezekiel. I CRIED to myself in the night, O God! is the day at hand? My spirit longs for the light, I weep in the shadow-land; For the black night brings to me bitter tears, The shadows call up the vanished years, The past troops by with its many biers, Ghosts in a ghastly band. Very sad is the day, I said; but the night I weep, Weep for the woes that slay, The terrors that compass sleep: For the sounds of the wailing never cease, The tides of the tears for aye increase, The shadows will never have rest and peace, What though the grave be deep. I lay me down in the dusk, After the day is done And the clouds in their hodden husk Have folded the golden sun: Now shall I cease from travail, I say, Now shall I put off the woes of day, Now shall I bury me far away Under the shadows dun. Vulture-winged cometh the dark, Brimming the air with the night; And I, I lie and I hark And strain mine eyes for a sight. I watch and hope, with a faith unfed, I lie and dream of a life unsped, I live in the things that are long since dead, I fancy the darkness light. I strive with a mighty stress To hold the terror from me, To ward off the ghastliness Of night and its mystery; I spread out my hope like a sail on seas That toss in the void to an unknown breeze, I strain my sense for a faith that flees And a joy that may not be. But pitiless cometh the gloom And the gray-winged spectres of Death, And stealthily creepeth the doom And the worm that continueth: The night is full of the shapes of ill, Strange phantoms moan at the window-sill, The voices wail at the wild wind's will; My heart grows cold with their breath. The moon is a ghostly face, The wraith of a radiance dead, That wanders across the space, Dead, but unhouselèd: The stars are the eyes of the sad still sprights, The lone lost souls that wander anights And mock the day with their weirdly lights And their flitting drearihead. There wavers about my bed, In the lurid gloom of the night, The awful host of the dead, Prisoned in spectral white: I read in their eyes the dreadful scrolls, The record of all the wrong that rolls, The pain that gathers about the souls, The terror that darkens light. I read in their sightless eyes The record of burning tears, The writing that never dies, The graven anguish and fears: I hear in their silent mouths the sound Of the wails that are mute and the cries that are drowned In the sombre heart of the passionless ground And the dead unburied years. One by one, without end, On through the night they go: As each through the gloom doth rend, I see a face that I know; I feel a sorrow a man has known, A brother-pain that has burnt and grown, Through the long sad years and the midnights lone, To a spectral shape of woe. I see the life of my fear, A ghastly wraith of the dead; I hear his cry in my ear, Though never a word be said. I feel a pang that was dumb before, I stand and gaze from a shadow-shore; I hear the waves of the death-sea roar And I know my heart has bled. The terrors revive again; The victims moan on the blast: I weep with the world in pain; I bleed with the wounded past: My heart is heavy with memories, My breast is weary with hopeless sighs; The moon weeps tears of blood in the skies And the stars with grief are ghast. My heart leaps up to my mouth With a mighty suffering; My soul is sick with a drouth, A nameless horrible thing: I may not seize on the shape of my fear, I may not close with my visions drear And lay my wraiths on the saving bier;— Ah, that my lips might sing! Oh, that my soul might soar On the living pinions of song And open the prison door Of life for that ghastly throng! Ah, would I might call each shape by his name, That my voice might chase them with singing flame To the quiet graves from whence they came And the slumber cold and long! The stress of the things of life With a throbbing agony stirred; The night and its spectral strife Took spirit and speech and word: ‘Shall none be potent to save?’ it cried; ‘Shall no light dawn in the darkness wide? Shall no voice roll back the shadow-tide? No saving song be heard?’ ‘Lo!’ and it said, ‘For the stress, The love fades out in men's hearts And there fadeth the loveliness From singers' and limners' arts; For a man must work for the bitter bread, Till his life has forgotten its goodlihead, Till his soul is heavy with doubt and dread And the bloom of his dream departs! ‘Surely a singer shall weep And a poet shall weave his verse With a pity tender and deep, With love instead of a curse; For all things thirst for a word of ruth; The sweet Spring even has lost its youth: The world is very dreary in truth And pain grows daily worse. ‘Lo! if a prophet should come And a singer to speak for men, To give a voice to the dumb, The world should be shriven then; The folk should be freed from the unknown woes, The griefs that are crimes and the pain that grows To a fruit of hate from the unshared throes And the unassoilzied pain. ‘The tyrant should recognize His spirit's bitterness, The sound of the agonies That crush his heart with their stress, The pain that has gathered to rage in his breast, In the stifled sobs of the folk opprest; The slayer should know his hopes unblest In his victims' hopelessness. ‘The folk should turn in a day To love and its years of gold; The tyrant should cease to slay, The years of anguish be told; For the eyes of the folk should be cleared to know That crime and sin and tyranny grow From a common root in a common woe, A sorrow dumb and cold. ‘Alas for the folk unsung In the dark and sorrowful ways! The earth is weary and wrung For lack of the poet's lays! O hearts of men, has the world no tears, Is there none to weep for the vanished years And the waste life troubled with doubts and fears And the weary dying days?’ Alas! for I may not speak! Alas! for my lips are dumb, And the words that the spell would break, Alas! for they will not come! I lie and groan with a dumb desire, I toss and burn with a sleepless fire And I long for the sound of a golden lyre And a poet's voice to come. I long for a poet's voice To lighten the sunless ways, To say to the earth, ‘Rejoice!’ To hearten the dreary days, To burst the chains of the silentness That holds the world in its dismal stress, To rend from being the prides that press And the terrors that amaze! I wait and am waiting still, I lie and suffer and long; How long shall the silence fill The haunts of sorrow and wrong? How long shall the great dumb host of the sad Hold sternly aloof, whilst the heaped years add To their anguish, for want of a singer had And a succour? O God! How long? A SONG OF DEAD LOVE. THERE came to me a dream in the midnight Of a fair shape beseen with glittering hair, The semblance of a woman, very fair, Yea, and most sorrowful; for all the light Within her eyes was faded for despite Of worldly woe, and all her bloom was fled, For grieving over ghosts of dead delight And wearying for Love and all his might, That in the petals of the rose lay dead, Mourned over by the lily's heavy head. ‘If any love,’ to me the shape did say, (And as she spoke I turned me in my bed, Wondering to look upon her goodlihead,) ‘Most meet it is, I should upon thee lay The task of warning him from love away. ‘For bitter sooth it is that Love doth lie All sadly buried from the eyes of day, Under the shredded petals of the May; And with his death did ease of lovers die And nought is left for them but tear and sigh. ‘Wherefore, if one have the desire of it, Unknowing what withal he must aby, This strait commandment unto thee give I, That thou with song do of Love's death let wit Those foolish souls that still their lives do knit ‘About an idle woman's gold-red hair And in the empty courts of Love do sit, Watching the torches for his funeral lit, That they should win their senses to forbear From loving aught, because the thing is fair. ‘For, of a truth, henceforth the end of love Shall be no more as it hath been whilere; Since he is dead, to whom there did repair Sick souls for solace. Whoso tastes thereof Heart-hunger all his days shall surely prove ‘And shall on no wise come to ease his pain; For, since Love's light is faded from above The world into the grave, his silver dove— That wont whilom all lovers to assain With balm and quickly make them whole again, ‘Nestling soft wings against their wounded hearts— Has for the sorrow of its Lord's death ta'en The semblance of a falcon, all a-stain With blood and milk, that of his rancour darts His ruddy beak into each heart that smarts ‘With lover's woe and delving in the breast, Doth tear and lacerate the inward parts, Until all hope of future ease departs From the sad soul and men are all opprest With unsalved love unto the utterest. ‘Wherefore, sing thou and warn the folk of ill!’ And I: ‘O lady, would my tongue were blest With happy words! But lo! I have no rest For agonies of love, that doth fulfil My sleepless soul and all its cruel will ‘Doth wreak on me, to bring me to despair. How shall I ward from men the darts that kill, When I myself am of their poison still Nigh stricken unto death? O lady fair! Teach me how I may win the bird to spare, ‘And then I will make shift for men to sing, As thou dost bid.’ But she, with such an air Of pity, answered, ‘First the song must fare,— And haply salve shall rest upon its wing.’ Wherefore I made this song, awakening. CADENCES. (MINOR.) THE olden memories buried lie, And the ancient fancies pass; The old sweet flower-thoughts wither and fly And die as the April cowslips die, That scatter the bloomy grass. All dead, my dear! And the flowers are dead And the happy blossoming Spring; The winter comes with its iron tread, The fields with the dying sun are red And the birds have ceased to sing. I trace the steps on the wasted strand Of the vanished Springtime's feet: Withered and dead is our Fairyland; For Love and Death go hand in hand, Go hand in hand, my sweet. (MAJOR.) OH, what shall be the burden of our rhyme And what shall be our ditty when the blossom's on the lime? Our lips have fed on winter and on weariness too long: We will hail the royal summer with a golden-footed song! O lady of my summer and my Spring, We shall hear the blackbird whistle and the brown sweet throstle sing And the low clear noise of waters running softly by our feet, When the sights and sounds of summer in the green clear fields are sweet. We shall see the roses blowing in the green, The pink-lipped roses kissing in the golden summer-sheen; We shall see the fields flower thick with stars and bells of summer-gold And the poppies burn out red and sweet across the corncrowned wold. The time shall be for pleasure, not for pain; There shall come no ghost of grieving for the past betwixt us twain; But in the time of roses our lives shall grow together And our love be as the love of gods in the blue Olympic weather. AREOPAGITICA. It may be expedient to note that the word “kings” is, by a quasi-elliptical figure, necessitated by the concision of expression inseparable from verse-composition, employed in this poem in a general sense, as a comprehensive term denoting, not only the traditional and semifabulous type of the bloodthirsty and heartless monarch of popular legend, but all kinds of egotistical and irresponsible oppressors of humanity, whether aristocratic or plebeian, ancient tyrants or modern exploiters of the Jacobin gospel of Liberty-to-oppress-one's-fellows, Flails of God or political breedbates, slavers or beanbaggers, worldwasters or Trade-union agitators, Philip II or Krüger, Lopez or Lassalle, Gengis Khan or Gambetta, Tiberius or Marat, Attila or O'Connell, Richard of Gloucester or Charles James Fox, Sylla or Moraes, Cromwell or Couthon, Borgia or Barère, Nero or Robespierre. (I confess that, for my part, I can see no moral difference,—except it be in favour of the superior frankness of the Roman ruffian, who, at least, did not claim to benefit humanity by the indulgence of his delirious appetites, —between the frenzied antics of the Imperial corybant, rhapsodizing over the ruins of his capital, and the hyena-orgies celebrated by the obscene cutthroats of the self-styled Comité du Salut Public, the dastardly purveyors of the guillotine, whilst engaged in organizing the cold-blooded murder of thousands of innocent victims of the best and worthiest blood of France.) The monarchical tyrant of the legendary type has for centuries past ceased to exist, the last (and imperfect) example having perhaps been offered by Louis XIV, although it must be confessed that the late Prince Bismarck and his “empéreur mécanique” presented many of the characteristic features of the genus. The debonair and soft-hearted rulers of our own days, Franz Josef of Austria, Leopold I of Belgium, Maximilian of Mexico, Ludwig I of Bavaria, Napoleon III, Humbert of Italy, Frederick of Germany, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, &amp;c., men illustrious for all the virtues calculated to adorn a private station and greatly to be pitied for the accident of fate which placed them in a position where their very qualities could not but militate against their security,—can in general be reproached with one sole default, to wit, the lack of the (to a monarch) indispensable capacity of sternness and determination, necessary for the protection, by the unsparing enforcement of justice and discipline, of themselves and their subjects from the irreconcilable enemies of society. Since the monstrous latter-day development (for its origin we must go back to the Garden of Eden or, yet farther into the dark backward of Time, to the birth of those eldest of the passions, greed and envy,) of the shameless and heartless juggle best known by the modern euphemism of “Liberalism” and the forcible inoculation of society with the Radical doctrines of “Ôte-toi de là, que je m'y mette” and “La carrière ouverte aux non-talents,” (notwithstanding the terrible object-lesson of the French Revolution, which demonstrated, once and for all and past all appeal, the radical falsity of the optimistic views of human nature maintained by Rousseau and his fellow-sentimentalists of the hysteric school and proved, with crushing conclusiveness, that the human animal, especially of the inferior ethnical strains, is, when unrestricted by laws and uncurbed by social and religious conventions, a ferocious and heartless wild beast, dangerous and pernicious to the world as to himself, the attempted realization of humanitarian theories and Republican chimeras, although absolutely unhindered and pursued, under exceptionally favourable circumstances, to its logical issue, having resulted in the absolute domination of the criminal classes and the utter ruin of France under the frightful oppression of the Jacobin leaders, men stained with the foulest vices, who would, under any decent system of government, have passed their whole lives in prison,) the equivalent of the old despot-type must be sought in the ranks of the so-called “popular” party, among the cynical and unscrupulous social and political agitators, who, in pursuit of their own private advantage, deliberately address themselves to excite class against class and to exploit, to their own profit, the brute passions and cupidities of the ignorant and gullible masses, upon whom the balance of political power has, by the incredible folly and weakness of their natural guardians and directors, been allowed to devolve; the “sophisticated rhetoricians” and professional humbuggers, the “tonguesters”, who, however carefully they may dissimulate the alliance, are the natural and inevitable abettors and coadjutors of the “knifesters”; the shameless jackpuddings who allow no consideration, public or private, to interfere with the flagrant indulgence of their raging vanity and of whom a fair sample is the crew of malignant busybodies who flood the less reputable portions of the press with their anti-patriotic vapourings and vent their spleen upon the country, which treats them with the well-merited contempt due to those who have an insatiable appetite for notoriety, but are naturally ungifted to achieve reputation by fair means, by heaping the filthiest calumnies on our armies and their commanders and extolling as saints and heroes the bandit hordes of froward and faithless churls, (notable for but one quality, a brute tenacity, an animal hardihood having little in common with the combination of magnanimous virtues, which we in England honour under the name of “courage”,) from whom our soldiers are now (March 1902) proceeding, with the noblest patience and with unexampled magnanimity, to deliver suffering South Africa; brief, among the tribe of fishers in troubled waters, who have, in the service of their own mean ends, extirpated the sense of moral obligation from the minds of the intellectually and morally lower classes (I speak of the wilfully ignoble “smart” class, so-called, at the top, no less than of the far more excusable, because passive and helpless, ethnical residuum at the bottom of the social scale) and have gone far to undermine the moral basis of society, the principle, incomparably formulated by Mazzini, of the performance of duty as the indispensable condition precedent of the enjoyment of any right, which is the necessary foundation of every social fabric. The names of such pests of society, men who have founded their fortunes, social, material and political, upon the ruin and misery of their dupes and the often irreparable injury of their native land, will suggest themselves (alas!) in abundance to all impartial students of contemporary politics and sociology,— names which will, it may safely be prophesied, be held by future generations in at least equal execration with those of the typical tyrants of tradition, as those of heartless and ruthless oppressors of their kind and enemies of humanity, who have brought more widespread ruin upon the world than Napoleon or Gengis Khan and who, by pursuing their private aims under the pretence of philanthropic enthusiasm and of engrossing concern for the welfare of their poorer fellows, have added the crowning sin of hypocrisy to the franker vices of their predecessors. ‘Parle aux oppresseurs; enveloppe-les des plaintes, des gémissements, des cris de leurs victimes; qu'ils les entendent dans leur sommeil et les entendent encore dans leur veille; qu'ils les voient errer autour d'eux comme des pâles fantômes, comme des ombres livides; que partout les suive l'effrayante vision; que ni le jour ni la nuit elle ne s'éloigne d'eux; qu'à l'heure du crépuscule, lorsqu'ils s'en vont à leurs fêtes impies, ils sentent sur leur chair l'attouchement de ces spectres et qu'ils frissonnent d'horreur.’ Lamennais, Une voix de prison. I WENT in the night of the summer, under the woods in the gloaming, Under the crown of the oaks and the solemn shade of the pines; I followed the lamps of the angels, over the firmament roaming, And sought for the ciphers of fate in their inscrutable signs. And lo! as I went in the shade, at the hour when the sky is darkened And the silver disc of the moon under the cloud-line dips, I heard a sound in the air, as if the forest-world hearkened; A power there was born in my breast and a spirit spoke from my lips, Saying, ‘Come forth and be judged, O ye that have darkened living, Ye that have stolen the sweet and the savour from pleasant life! I tell you, the hour is at hand that shuts you out from forgiving, The time you shall answer for all you've sown of anguish and strife. ‘Stand forth, o ye kings, in your purple! Stand forth, o ye priests, in your shame! Merchants and slavers, ye all that thrive on the blood of your kind! Ye all that have helped in men's bosoms to stifle the sacred flame, Have stolen their fruit of gladness and left but the bitter rind! ‘Stand forth and give ear to the wrongs, as the bards and the sages have told them, Your fellows have done to men, in the dusk of the bygone time! Hearken and tremble for fear, as the eyes of your soul behold them Bound in the singing hell of the poet's terrible rhyme! ‘Kein Gott, kein Heiland erlöst ihn je Aus diesen singenden Flammen!’ —Heine. ‘Stand forth, o ye kings, in your purple; masters of nations and armies! Ye all that have held in your hands the keys of evil and good! Ye all that have ransacked life to search and to see where the charm is, Have rifled the blossoms of hell to stay your hunger with food! ‘Ye all that have not been content with lusting and riot and madness, Have sucked for a sharper delight in your people's anguish and fears, Have made your life joyous with pain and glad from your servants' sadness, Fair, fair with the horror of blood, sweet, sweet with the bitter of tears! ‘Behold! I will summon you up from the heart of the glooms infernal; Up, up from your darksome graves; up, up from your slumbers of stone. I will make you your shame for a sign and your anguish a thing eternal; I will spare not a whit to your souls of the ruin and wrack you have sown. ‘Stand forth and be judged, o ye merchants! that heap you up gold without measure, That wither to sparkling dross the golden fruit of the years, That gather the incense of sighs and the sweat of men's blood for your treasure, That fashion to gold our griefs and make coined gold of our tears! ‘Ye all that have thrived on the pain and the griefs and the need of the toilers, Have bounden your burdens on life, that hold it tearless and dumb! Ye all that, to lengthen the scope and the harvest-time for the spoilers, Have sealed up the portals of Life, lest Death the deliverer come! In allusion to the civil and religious prohibition of suicide, a truly fiendish invention of Semitic origin. ‘Stand forth and be judged, o ye priests! that suck out the souls of the nations, That darken the azure of heaven into the gloom of a pall, That fetter men's health and their strength with your prayers and your imprecations, That poison their hopes with doubting and mingle their gladness with gall! Ye all that have ever been ready to work out the will of the tyrants, To toll, at a despot's bidding, fair Freedom's funeral knell! Ye all that to strangle thought and to shackle its upward aspirance, Have lengthened the struggles of life into the horrors of hell! Behold! I will summon you up the pale sad shapes without number, That gave up the ghost without speaking, the spoil of your pitiless hands! I will call up the unnamed victims that whelm all the world with their cumber, That fester the fields with their anguish and shade with their sorrow the lands! ‘You think ye have silenced them now; and the spirit within you rejoices! You think that requital is none and none shall rebuke you again! I tell you, I hear in mine ears the dumb inarticulate voices, That speak with the clearness of thunder from ocean and forest and plain! ‘I tell you, the hollow graves, where the tyrants that went before you Lie in the prison-sleep of the middle sepulchre's gloom, Are bound with the selfsame fate that threatens and hovers o'er you, Ring with the selfsame curse and quake with the selfsame doom! ‘For the doom that their victims wrought not, the curse that they died unspeaking, Grew and shall grow for aye with their mouldering forms in the earth: The vengeance they might not wreak, the winds and the worms are wreaking, Breaking the sleep of the dead with a fierce and terrible mirth. ‘But lo! a more horrible doom and a nearer vengeance are waiting For you, if ye turn not away from your sins and humble your heads. For the fate, that is ripened for you, shall wait no death for its sating, Shall grow in your living hearts and lie in your silken beds. ‘I tell you, the soul of the dead and the wailing dumb in their dying Is gathered again by the winds and garnered up in the flowers: I tell you, their yearning is hid and their curses and prayers are lying, Ready to burst on your heads, in the womb of the coming hours. ‘For a season shall be when the meat that you eat shall be sad with their curses, The drink that you drink shall be deadly and bitter to death with their tears, The garments you wear shall burn and eat to your hearts like Dirce's, The sights that you see shall be as a fire that maddens and sears. ‘The eyes of the dead shall look, with a doom and an accusation, From the eyes of the friends you love and the maidens that kiss your lips; The voice of the dead in your ears shall clamour without cessation; The shade of their hate shall darken your lives with its fell eclipse. ‘And if you shall say: The grave will give us the peace we burn for, Will bring us the senseless sleep and the rest untroubled by thought; We shall sleep with our fathers of old and have the ease that we yearn for, Free from the memory's pain and the wraiths of the things we wrought; ‘The doom that you laid on others shall fall on yourselves, unsparing; The anguish you felt of old shall seem as nought to the new: For the earth, that shall wrap you about, shall shutter you in from all sharing, Shall fetter you fast in her arms, where nothing can succour you. ‘The lapses you had in life, when the anguish failed for a second And the memory slid away from the moment's glitter and glow, You shall never have them again, when once the angel hath beckoned, When once your bodies are dust and your heads in the tomb are low. ‘For the wraiths of the wrongs you wrought shall compass you round, unceasing; The spirits of all the dead you crushed in your bitter strife Shall gird you about with a fire and an anguish for aye increasing, Shall fashion for you in death a new and terrible life. ‘Wherefore I bid you repent. For the time draws nigh to the reaping; The harvest ripens apace and the sickle lies in the tares. I counsel you turn from your sins with fear and sorrow and weeping, Whilst yet the trumpets are dumb and the fire of the judgment spares.’ A BACCHIC OF SPRING. ‘Le beau Dionysos, dont le regard essuie Les cieux et fait tomber la bienfaisante pluie, Qui s'élance, flot d'or, dans les pores ouverts De notre terre et fait gonfler les bourgeons verts.’ Théodore de Banville. I. OUT of the fields the snowdrops peep: To work, O land! Awake, O earth, from the white snow-sleep, Shake off the coverlet soft and deep; Spring is at hand. Thou hast slumbered the months away long enough; 'Tis time for the winter rude and rough To die and give way To the bloomy May: Awake and shake off the tyrant gruff! Up from the numbing clasp of the snow! Shake off the winter weather! The breath of the year grows warm apace, As the snowflakes melt from his fresh young face, And the eastern moorlands are all aglow With their budding heather. Already the swallows are calling, “Cheep! cheep! All things are waking from their long sleep, We and the Spring together.” See where the battle-host of the blooms Waits for the fray; See where the cowardly tyrant glooms: He knows the scent of those soft bright dooms, That say to him, ‘Hence away!’ Over the meadows their squadrons glitter, Orange and purple and white and blue, Jewel-helmed with the diamond-dew, A fairy army of sweet Spring roses, Of bluebell-blossoms and pale primroses, Spreads out its ranks in the balmy air, Whilst the lark and linnet and blackbird twitter A quaint war-march for each elfin Ritter, That troops in the alleys fair. II. Wearyful winter is gone at last, With its wild winds sighing, And the blooms of the Spring are flocking fast: Primrose and cowslip and windflower-bells Broider the grass in the cool wood-dells; Cloud-roses over the sky are flying. Evoë! the chill of the year is dying! Good-bye to the bitter blast! Iö! the hillocks are mad with bliss, As the new sweet stirring Quickens their hearts with the vernal kiss! Silver and azure and golden green, The meadows shine in the warm Spring-sheen And the music of myriad wings is whirring, As the birds, that fled from the winter frore, Back to the isle with the silver shore Hasten from spice-forests far away In the Indian seas, To revel in blossom-embroidered May, As the flower-hosts chase out the winter gray From the newly wakened leas. Bacchus returns from the Eastern skies; Welcome his train with their bright wood-sheen! Evoë! he brings us the golden prize, The charm of the Indian queen, He battled so long for and won at last; He brings us the spell that unchains the flowers And loosens the wheels of the golden hours, When the power of the frost is waning fast, When the chill snowflakes from the landscape fly And the dying eastwinds wearily sigh, ‘Alas! our winter is past!’ See! to the eastward his lance-points gleam! Iö! the time is near! Evoë! the winter wanes like a dream, As the diamond helms of the Bassarids beam And the May-blooms glow in the sun's full stream, That glitters on every spear. Already I hear their voices' hum And the pipe and clang of their silver reeds And their songs of the Spring-god's sweet flower-deeds, As back from the golden East he leads His sea-shell car with the tiger steeds: Evoë! the Spring is come! Evoë, Lyæus! the Spring is here! Onward they come apace. See how the landscape, bare and sere, Flushes at once with a golden bliss, As the earliest touch of the vernal kiss Gilds with a tender grace The grand old winter-enwounded trees, That throb and sway in the balmy breeze, Sweet from the flower-strewn plains; Whilst the radiant train of the wine-god sweeps Through the inmost heart of the woodland deeps And the 'wildering thrill of the Springtide creeps Up through their frost-dried veins. A SOUL'S ANTIPHON. I. MY soul burst forth in singing, My heart flowered like a rose; Chimes of sweet songs fled ringing Along the forest close. Is it the new year springing? Is it the May that blows? No; it was none of those. Among the trees came flying A spirit like a flame; A sound of songs and sighing, Mixed, round his presence came; A sound of soft airs dying, The music of a name, Fainting for its sweet shame. A white shape wreathed with flowers, A winged shape like a dove; Hands soft as peach-bloom showers; Eyes like an orange-grove In whose enchanted bowers The magic fire-flies rove: I knew his name;—'twas Love. ‘O soul!’ I said, ‘the voices That flutter in thy breast, The yearning that rejoices In its own vague unrest, Are all in vain: the choice is 'Twixt Life's and Love's behest. Choose now, which is the best.’ The winged white Love came calling, With words like linnet-lays, When hawthorn-snows are falling About the forest ways. His speech was so enthralling, Such spells were in his gaze, My heart flowered with his praise. He came to me with kisses And looked into mine eyes; My soul brimmed up with blisses; But with the bliss came sighs, As when a serpent hisses Beneath flower-tapestries And moss piled cushion-wise. The sad old thoughts came flocking Up to that look of his: For memory and its mocking, I could not smile, ywis; It was as the unlocking Of doors on an abyss Wherein old living is. It was like grief recounting The happy times of yore; It was like gray waves mounting A lost sun-golden shore, Like sad thoughts over-counting The sweet things gone before, The days that are no more. And as I looked with sighing Into the sweet shape's eyes, I saw a serpent lying 'Mid balms of Paradise; I knew my dole undying, The presage sad and wise, The worm that never dies. Love laughed and fled, a-leaping, Between the flower-flushed breres, And left my sad thoughts keeping The vigil of the years: My soul burst out in weeping; I saw my hopes and fears Troop by, embalmed in tears. II. My soul burst forth in weeping, My heart swelled like a sea; There came sad wind-notes sweeping Across the golden lea: Is autumn past, and reaping? Is winter come for me? No, no, it cannot be. Among the trees came slowly A spirit like a flower, A lily pale and holy, White as a winter hour: Sad peace possessed him wholly; Around him, like a sower, He cast a silver shower; A shower of silver lilies, Each one a haunting thought: It was as when a rill is Across waste rose-bowers brought And all the heart's grief still is And one has pain in nought: Such peace their perfumes wrought. ‘O soul!’ I said, ‘the sadness That is in this one's breath Is sweeter than the madness That round Love fluttereth: This one shall bring heart's gladness And balms of peace and faith; For lo! his name is Death.’ The pale sweet shape came strewing Flower-tokens on the grass; His face was the renewing Of love in a dream-glass; His speech was like bird-wooing, When moonlight-shadows pass. My soul sighed out, ‘Alas!’ He came to me with sighing, My hand in his he took; My soul wept nigh to dying, For all his piteous look: Yet in his eyes was lying Peace, as of some still brook Laid through a forest-nook. The memories of past sorrow Brimmed up mine eyes with tears; I could not choose but borrow Fresh grief from the waste years: And yet some sweet to-morrow Smiled through, as when rain clears Off, and the sun appears. It was as if one, peering Into a well of woe, Saw all the shadow clearing From the brown deeps below; Saw sapphire skies appearing And woods with moss aglow And Spring in act to blow. With tearful looks, I, gazing Into the sad shape's eyes, Saw a new magic tracing New lovely mysteries; I saw new hope upraising A new love-paradise And clear moon-silvern skies. My soul fled forth in singing, My heart flowered like a rose; Death smiled, with sweet tears springing, 'Twixt smile and smile that rose. His arms closed round me, clinging: Peace came and clipt me close; Peace, such as no love knows. A SONG OF WILLOW. LOVE and Life have had their day, Long ago; Hope and Faith have fled for aye, With the roses and the May; This is but an idle show: Come away! Seekest thou for flowers of June, Roses red? Listenest for the linnet's tune? Here the night-fowl wails the moon; Here are lilies of the dead, Tear-bestrewn. Thinkest Love will come again, Fresh and sweet, With the apple-blossoms' rain? Many a day dead Love has lain, Folded in the winding-sheet. Hope is vain. See, Death beckons from the gloom; (Come away!) Life is wasted from its room, Love is faded from its bloom; Come and shelter in the gray Of the tomb. Come away! The bed is laid, Soft and deep; In the blossomed lindens' shade, Underneath the moon-pale glade, In the quiet shalt thou sleep, Unaffrayed. Kiss thy love, ‘Farewell’, and say, ‘Joy and pain!’ In the shadow come thee lay Of the night that hath no day, Where sleep healeth heart and brain: Come away! SONGS' END. THE chime of a bell of gold That flutters across the air, The sound of a singing of old, The end of a tale that is told, Of a melody strange and fair, Of a joy that is grown despair: For the things that have been for me I shall never have them again; The skies and the purple sea And day like a melody And night like a silver rain Of stars on forest and plain. They are shut, the gates of the day; The night has fallen on me: My life is a lightless way; I sing yet, while as I may. Some day I shall cease, maybe: I shall live on yet, you will see. TOURNESOL. These two poems served as Prelude and Postlude respectively to my “New Poems” published in 1880. GEOFFREY of Rudel! How the name Leaps to the lips like a flower of flame, Holding the heart with a dream of days When life lay yet in the flowered ways And the winds of the world were stirred and strong With blast of battle and silver of song; When love was long and women were true And the bell of the steadfast sky was blue Over a world that was white as yet From load of labour and fruitless fret Of hunger for gain and greed of gold, That now have made us our young world old! I hail thee, honest and tender time! I, last of many, that with rude rhyme Ring out reproach to the cheerless air And chide the age that it is not fair. And first of any the blames I bring, I chide it for lack of love-liking, For fall of faith and hope grown cold, For love turned lusting and youth grown old. For where, I pray you, in this our day Lives there the lover that loves alway And where is the lady whose constant eye Shall seek one only until she die? Alack for Rudel and Carmosine, Whose loves, as the constant sun his sheen, Burn like a beryl in lays of yore! Their day is dead as the bale they bore For faithful fancy; and now alone In minstrels' making their name is known. Their thought is perished, their peerless fame Faded and past as the marish flame That flees from the blink of the breaking day; And love is dead with them, wellaway! For now men's love is a fitful fire, A wayless desert of waste desire; And women's love is a cold caprice, A wind that changes without surcease. For the lifelong love that in days of old Was dearer than lands and grain and gold, The love that possessed men's heart and soul In life and leisure, in death and dole, That stirred their spirits to many a deed Of noble daring, that was the meed Of haughty honour and high emprize, That made men look in their lady's eyes For gain and guerdon of all their strife, This love lack we in our modern life. For the folk through the fretful hours are hurled On the ruthless rush of the wondrous world And none has leisure to lie and cull The blossoms that made life beautiful In that old season when men could sing For dear delight in the risen Spring And Summer ripening fruit and flower. Now carefulness cankers every hour; We are too weary and sad to sing; Our pastime's poisoned with thought-taking. The bloom is faded from all that's fair And grey with smoke is the grievous air. None lifts to luting his hand and voice Nor smites the strings with a joyful noise; For all who sing in the land are pale; Their voice is the voice of those that wail For beauty buried and hang the head For the dream of a day evanishèd. How shall we say sweet things in rhyme Of this our marvellous modern time, We that are heavy at heart to sing, But may not rejoice for remembering? We care not, we, for the gorgeous glow Of wealth and wonder, the stately show Of light and luxury, that sweeps past, Unheeded, before our eyes downcast. The pageant of passion and pride and crime, That fills the face of the turncoat time, The gold that glitters, the gems that glow, Hide not from us the wasting woe That gnaws at the heart of the hungry age. The starving soul in the crystal cage Looks through the loop of the blazoned bars, As out of heaven the sorrowing stars Gaze on the grief of the night newborn. What shall we do for the world forlorn, We that drink deep of its sorrowing? What can we do, alas! but sing? Sing as the bird behind the wire, That pours out his passion of dear desire, His fret for the forest far away, His hunger of hope for the distant day When peradventure shall ope for him The door that darkens on heaven's rim; What can we do, bird-like, but pour Into our singing the dreams of yore, The long desire of the soul exiled From some sweet Eden laid waste and wild? And if, by fortune, we turn our feet, Torn with long travel, toward that sweet, That happy haven of “long ago” And tune our lutany soft and low To some dear ditty of things that were, Memoried with melodies faint and fair, Shall any blame us for this that we Fordid Time's tyranny and forgot Awhile life's lovelessness? I trow not; For song is sinless and fancy free. A FUNERAL SONG FOR THÉOPHILE GAUTIER. WHAT shall our song be for the mighty dead, For this our master that is ours no more? Lo! for the dead was none of those that wore The laurel lightly on a heedless head, Chanting a song of idle lustihead Among the sun-kissed roses on the shore: This our belovèd, that is gone before, Was of the race of heroes battle-bred That, from the dawn-white to the sunset-red, Fought in the front of war. Lo! this was he that in the weary time, In many a devious and darkling way, Through dusk of doubt and thunder of dismay, Held our hearts hopeful with his resonant rhyme, Lifting our lives above the smoke and slime Into some splendid summer far away, Where the sun brimmed the chalice of the day With gold of heaven and the accordant chime Of woods and waters to the calm sublime Carolled in roundelay. This was our poet in the front of faith; Our singer gone to his most sweet repose, Sped to his summer from our time of snows And winter winding all the world with death. Who shall make moan or utter mournful breath That this our noblest one no longer knows Our evil place of toil and many woes, Lying at the last where no voice entereth? Who shall weave for him other than a wreath Of laurel and of rose? Hence with the cypress and the funeral song! Let not the shrill sound of our mourning mar His triumph that upon the Immortals' car Passes, star-crowned; but from the laurelled throng, That stands await, let every voice prolong A noise of jubilance that from afar Shall hail in heaven the new majestic star That rises with a radiance calm and strong, To burn for ever unobscured among The courts where the Gods are. Ay, let the hautboys and the clarions blow, The air rain roses and the sky resound With harpings of his peers that stand around, What while the splendours of the triumph go Along the streets and through the portico. I, too, who loved the dead, as from the ground The glow-worm loves the star, will stand, browbound With winter-roses, in the sunset-glow, And make thin music, fluting soft and low Above his funeral mound. I, too, who loved him, from beyond the sea, Add my weak note to that sublime acclaim That, soaring with the silver of his name, Shall shake the heavens with splendid harmony, Till all who listen bend in awe the knee, Seeing a giant's spirit, like a flame, Remounting to that heaven from which it came, And many weep for very shame to see The majesty they knew not till 'twas free From earthly praise or blame. Hail, O our master! From the hastening hours This one we set above its grey-veiled peers, Armed with thy name against the night that nears. We crown it with the glory of the flowers, We wind it with all magic that is ours Of song and hope and jewel-coloured tears; We charm it with our love from taint of fears; We set it high against the sky that lowers, To burn, a love-sign, from the topmost towers, Through glad and sorry years. ANOTHER BIRTHDAY SONG. THE rose-time and the roses Call to me, dove of mine; I hear the birdsong-closes Ring out in the sunshine; In all the wood-reposes There runs a magic wine Of music all divine. All things have scent and singing; The happy earth is ringing With praise of love and June: Have I alone no tune, No sound of music-making To greet my love's awaking This golden summer noon? Ah, love! my roses linger For sunshine of thine eyes; For Love the music-bringer My linnets wait to rise; All dumb are birds and singer: The song in kisses dies And sound of happy sighs. What need of songs and singing, When love for us is ringing Bells of enchanted gold? Dear, whilst my arms enfold My love, our kisses fashion Tunes of more perfect passion Than verses new or old. LOVE'S AMULET. SONG, be strong and true to hold Love within thy locks of gold: Bind my lady's thought with rhyme; Kiss her if her lips grow cold; Bring her thoughts of summer-prime, Lest her heart catch winter-time. Song, be quick and bold. Take her flowers of love and light, Blossoms of her soul's delight, Roses of her heart's desire; Bind her brow with lilies white; Lilies' snow and roses' fire Hold love's summer ever by her, In the world's despite! Strew the Springtime in her way, Lest she weary of the day, Lest the lonely hours be long; Be her season ever May, May, when Love is safe from wrong And with larks' and linnets' song All the world is gay. Sweet, I wind thee with a chain, Verses linked in one refrain, “Love me, love, who love but thee,” Piping ever and again; Bind thy thought and heart to be Constant aye to Love and me Thorow joy and pain. MADRIGAL GAI. THE summer-sunshine comes and goes; The bee hums in the heart of the rose: Heart of my hope, the year is sweet; The lilies lighten about thy feet. A new light glitters on land and sea; The turtles couple on every tree. Light of my life, the fields are fair; Gossamers tangle thy golden hair. The air with kisses is blithe and gay; Love is so sweet in the middle May. Sweet of my soul, the brook is blue; Thine eyes with heaven have pierced it through. Now is the time for kisses, now When bird-songs babble from every bough. Sweetest, my soul is a bird that sips Honey of heaven from out thy lips. LOVE'S AUTUMN. (Field's Nocturne in D Minor). YES, love, the Spring shall come again; But not as once it came: Once more in meadow and in lane The daffodils shall flame, The cowslips blow, but all in vain; Alike, yet not the same. The roses that we plucked of old Were dewed with heart's delight: Our gladness steeped the primrose-gold In half its lovely light: The hopes are long since dead and cold, That flushed the wind-flowers' white. Ah, who shall give us back our Spring? What spell can fill the air With all the birds of painted wing That sang for us whilere? What charm reclothe with blossoming Our lives grown blank and bare? What sun can draw the ruddy bloom Back to hope's faded rose? What stir of summer re-illume Our hearts' wrecked garden-close? What flowers can fill the empty room Where now the nightshade grows? 'Tis but the Autumn's chilly sun That mocks the glow of May; 'Tis but the pallid bindweeds run Across our garden way, Pale orchids, scentless every one, Ghosts of the summer day. Yet, if it must be so, 'tis well: What part have we in June? Our hearts have all forgot the spell That held the summer noon; We echo back the cuckoo's knell And not the linnet's tune. What should we do with roses now, Whose cheeks no more are red? What violets should deck our brow, Whose hopes long since are fled? Recalling many a wasted vow And many a faith struck dead. Bring heath and pimpernel and rue, The Autumn's sober flowers: At least their scent will not renew The thought of happy hours Nor drag sad memory back unto That lost sweet time of ours. Faith is no sun of summer-tide, Only the pale calm light That, when the Autumn clouds divide, Hangs in the watchet height, A lamp, wherewith we may abide The coming of the night. And yet, beneath its languid ray, The moorlands bare and dry Bethink them of the summer day And flower, far and nigh, With fragile memories of the May, Blue as the August sky. These are our flowers: they have no scent To mock our waste desire, No hint of bygone ravishment To stir the faded fire: The very soul of sad content Dwells in each azure spire. I have no violets: you laid Your blight upon them all: It was your hand, alas! that made My roses fade and fall, Your breath my lilies that forbade To come at summer's call. Yet take these scentless flowers and pale, The last of all my year: Be tender with them; they are frail: But, if thou hold them dear, I'll not their brighter kin bewail, That now lie cold and sere. ASPECT AND PROSPECT. “Cup of wine, heart's blood, on each One or other They bestow.” — Hafiz. ccxxvi, 5. I. THE time is sad with many a sign and token; Desire and doubting in all hearts have met; The ancient orders of the world are broken; The night is spent, the morning comes not yet: Men go with face against the Future set, Each asking each, “When shall the wreak be wroken? When shall the God come and the word be spoken To end Life's passion and its bloody sweat?” For sowing-time hath failed us even at reaping; Time hath torn out the eyes and heart of faith; Of all our gladness there abideth weeping; Of all our living we have woven us death: For many a hope is dead for lack of breath And many a faith hath fallen and is sleeping, Weary to death with the long hopeless keeping The watch for day that never morroweth. For all our lives are worn with hopeless yearning; There is no pleasantness in all our days: The world is waste and there is no returning For our tired feet into old flowered ways. Long use hath shorn our summer of its rays; Of all our raptures there is left but burning; We are grown sadly wise and for discerning, The sweet old dreams are hueless to our gaze. We trust not Love, for he is God no longer: Another hath put on his pleasant guise: The greater God hath bowed him to the stronger; Death looks at life from many a lover's eyes: And underneath the linden-tree he lies, The gracious torch-bearer of ancient story, His sweet face faded and his pinions' glory Dim as the gloss of grass-grown memories. No gods have we to trust to, new or olden; The blue of heaven knows their thrones no more: The races of the gods in death are holden: Their pale ghosts haunt the icy river's shore. Availeth not our beating at their door: There is no presence in their halls beholden; The silence fills their jewelled thrones and golden; The shadow lies along their palace-floor. And lo! if any set his heart to singing, Thinking to witch the world with love and light, Strains of old memories set the stern chords ringing; The morning answers with the songs of night. For who shall sing of pleasance and delight, When all the sadness of the world is clinging About his heart-strings and each breeze is bringing Its burden of despairing and despite? Help is there none: night covers us down-lying To sleep that comes uneath with devious dreams: The morning brings us sadness but and sighing: We gather sorrow from the noontide beams: And if a man set eyes on aught that seems An oasis of peace, he finds, on nighing, Its promise false, and sad almost to dying, Turns from the mirage and its treacherous streams. II. And yet one hope by well-nigh all is cherished,— Albeit many hold it unconfest,— The dream of days that, when this life has perished And all its strife and turmoil are at rest, Shall rise for men out of some mystic West,— A paradise of peace, where death comes never And life flows calmly as some dreamy river That wanders through the islands of the Blest; A dream of love-lorn hearts made whole of sorrow, Of all life's doubts and puzzles fleeted by, Of severed lives reknit in one to-morrow Of endless bliss beneath the cloudless sky; A dream of lands where hope shall never die, But in the fair clear fields, browbound with moly, Our dead desires shall wander, healed and holy, And over all a mystic peace shall lie; A peace that shall be woven of old sadness And bitter memories grown honey-sweet, Where our lost hopes shall live again in gladness, Chaining the summer to their happy feet; Where never fulness with desire shall meet Nor the sweet earth divide from the clear heaven Nor mortal grossness shall avail to leaven The ecstasy of that supernal seat. III. Ah! lovely dreams that come and go! Shall ever hope to harvest grow? Of all that sow shall any reap? I know not, I: but this I know; Whether the years bring weal or woe, Whether the Future laugh or weep, I shall not heed it;—I shall sleep. I have lived out this life of ours; I can no more.—Through shine and showers, March lapses into full July: The May sun coaxes out the flowers, And through the splendid summer hours Their tender little lives go by; And when the winter comes, they die. But in the Spring they live again. Not so with us, whose lives have lain In ways where love and grief are rife, Whose seventy years of sadness strain Toward the gates of rest in vain; Our souls are worn with doubt and strife; We have no seed of second life. And yet for those whose lives have been Through storm and sun alike serene, Drinking the sunshine and the dew In every break of summer sheen, I doubt not but the unforeseen May treasure for these flower-like few A life where heart and soul renew; A life where Love no more shall bring The pains of hell upon its wing, Where perfect peace at last shall dwell, That happy peace that is the king Of all the goods we poets sing, That all with aching hearts foretell, Yet know them unattainable. But we, whom Love hath wrecked and torn, Whose lives with waste desire are worn, Whose souls life-long have been as lyres Vibrating to each breath that's borne Across our waste of days forlorn, Whose paths are lit with funeral fires, The monuments of dead desires, We, for whom many lives have past, Through storm and summer, shine and blast, Within our one man's span of years, We may not hope for peace at last Save where the shade of Sleep is cast And from our eyes Death's soft hand clears The thought alike of smiles and tears. Yet (for we loved you, brothers all,— That love us not,—despite the wall Of crystal that between us lies,) We, to whose eyes, whate'er befall, No angel could the hope recall, We dream for you of brighter skies, Of life new-born in Paradise: We hope for you that golden day When God (alas!) shall wipe away The tears from all the eyes that weep; And from our lonely lives we pray That, of that happy time, some ray Of your filled hope, your souls that reap, May reach us, dream-like, in our sleep. MELISANDE. These two poems served as Prelude and Postlude respectively to my “New Poems” published in 1880. I. AH lady of the lands of gold! Who shall lay hands on thee and hold Thy beauty for a space as long As pausing of a linnet's song? Ah lady of the lays of old, When love is life and right is wrong! Ah lady of the dear old dream! We watch Love's roses on the stream That spins its silver in the land Where garlands glitter from thy hand: Ah singer of the sweets that seem! When shall the dream take shape and stand? Ah dear in dreams, lost long ago! A sound of lutings soft and low, A scent of roses newly prest, Cease never from the dreamful West: When shall a man draw near to know The sweetness of thy perfect breast? II. A dream of days too far to fill: The thin clear babble of the rill That trickles through the fainting flowers; A monotone of mourning hours; The dim dawn coming sad and still; The evening's symphony of showers. A lone land under a sere sky; And stretching tow'rd the veil on high, My soul, a flower that seeks the sun; The dull days dropping, one by one; The darkness drawing ever nigh; And still nor dream nor life is won. III. Ah sunflower-heart! ah Melisande! When shall the dream take shape and stand? When shall thy lips melt into mine? When shall I drink thy looks like wine? Shall earth for once turn fairyland And all the past take shape and shine? Alas! such hopes were vain indeed: The waste world knoweth not the seed That bears the blossom of delight. Shall one go forth to sow the night And look to reap sun-coloured weed And lilies of the morning light? Who would not be content to know That at the last,—when sin and woe Had done their worst and life had lain Before the gates that shut out pain,— The bitter breeze of death should blow The mirage from the sullen plain And for a little sun-filled space His sight should feed on his love's face And in her eyes his soul drink deep,— And then upon him death should creep And snatch him, sudden, to the place Where all things gather to a sleep? Ah lovers, God but grant you this, To breathe your life out in a kiss, To sleep upon your lady's breast The hour life lapses into rest! For me, I ask none other bliss Than Rudel's, deeming his the best. IN MEMORIAM OLIVER MADOX BROWN ob. Nov. 5, 1874. FRIEND, whom I loved in those few years and fleeting The envious fates, which hound all things that be From death to birth, appointed thee and me To be together in the nether air Of this our world of care, Swift severance and brief and seldom meeting, I cry to thee with one last word of greeting, Across the darkness and the unknown sea. With one last word I cry to thee, my brother, One word of love and memory and grief, That on thy grave, even as an autumn leaf Fallen from the tree of my sad soul, all sere With winter drawing near, May lie, for lack of rose or lys or other Bloom of the Spring or Summer, that our mother Hath ta'en from me, to fill her funeral sheaf,— Our mother Death; for thou too knewst of sadness, Even in the brief sweet season of thy Spring; Ay, and the stroke of thine upmounting wing, Thus early pointing to the eternal height, Even in its callowest flight, Bore thee far up above men's careless gladness Into those realms of lone, yet glorious madness, Where all God's poets suffer, see and sing. I cry into the dark with lamentation, A cry of grief and love-longing and pain For lack of that rich heart and teeming brain, Which, had not envious Fate denied, were fain To soar to such a strain As should have gladdened folk in many a nation And made men's hearts flower full with jubilation, Even as the roses in the summer rain: Yea, and regret for him my friend departed, For solace lost to me and friendly cheer And sympathy that made the world less drear, Regret and memory and bitter dole For that bright noble soul, Swift-spirited, yet true and tender-hearted, With whom full many a joy and pain I parted, In that brief season he was with us here. Ah, what is left, from Death's supreme surrender, Of that bright wit, to all fair ends attuned, That vaulting thought, which soared nor ever swooned Nor drooped its pinions in the ethereal air Of noble dreams and fair? Only for us, to whom no prayers can render Thy presence or thy heart so true and tender, Memory abides, to solace and to wound. Thou shalt not be of those whom Time effaces, Whilst yet the mould is moist above their head, Whose memories fade and pass and all is said; Nay, for us all, who loved thee and who love, Shining life's fret above, Thy thought shall throne it in our hearts' high places, Till Death blot past and present from our faces; Thou shalt not be of the forgotten dead. Thy face in many a page of mystic poet Shall haunt me and thy voice in many a strain Of strange sad music, to whose weird refrain Our souls made answer with so whole a might Of delicate delight We grudged well-nigh that any else should know it, Should bear its frail fair seed abroad and sow it, To wither on the general heart and brain. Thy speech, with all its high and generous passion For noble things, its scorn of all untruth, And all the dainty blossom of thy youth, Thy youth oft wiser than my riper age, Shall on the picturing page Of memory itself anew refashion And live, though time on thee took no compassion And Death on us thy lovers had no ruth. What though no power on earth avail to move thee To sight or speech of any mother's son, Thee, that art shut from sight of moon and sun? For me, thy high sweet spirit, like a flower, In this memorial hour, Pierces the grass-grown earth that lies above thee; Thou knewst I loved thee and thou knowst I love thee; And in that knowledge still our souls are one. And if thy life's untimely ended story, Thy life so thick with many an early bloom And seed of blooms yet brighter, hold no room, For very ratheness, in the inconstant ken Of quick-forgetting men, Yet, for our hearts, though Time himself grow hoary, The lily of love, if not the rose of glory, Shall flower and fade not on thy timeless tomb. SALUT D'AMOUR. LOVE of leafy days, Whilst the summer stays, Whilst the fields are golden and the skies are blue, I am sure of you. Whilst the sunshine plays In the scented ways And the world is new, In the glory of your gaze, Sweet of summer, Love looks through. Then I hold you, joy of June, When the woods burst out in tune And the marigolds are shining with their mirrors of the sun, When the day and night are one, When the sunlight's golden shoon And the silver-sandalled moon After one another run, Through the pearl and opal cloisters of the sky, Like a youth and maid that fly From each other nor draw nigh But at morning and at evening, when the twilight is begun. Bird of August skies, Love that never dies, Whilst the sunshine lingers, hovers on your brow; Still the love-looks rise In your happy eyes: Hap what may when winter rages, In your breast when frosty age is And the bleak and surly snowtime turns your blood to ice, Now, at least, whilst throstles tarry and the blossom's on the bough, Ours is present Paradise: Come what will, you love me now. EPILOGUE TO THE BOOK OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND ONE NIGHT. The “new and valued friend” referred to in this “Epilogue” was the late Sir R. F. Burton. TWELVE years this day,—a day of winter, dreary With drifting snows, when all the world seemed dead To Spring and hope,—it is since, worn and weary Of doubt within and strife without, I fled From the mean workday miseries of existence, From spites that slander and from hates that lie, Into the dreamland of the Orient distance, Under the splendours of the Syrian sky, And in the enchanted realms of Eastern story, Far from the lovelessness of modern times, Garnered the rainbow-remnants of old glory That linger yet in those ancestral climes. And now, the long task done, the journey over, From that far home of immemorial calms, Where, as a mirage, on the sky-marge hover The desert and its oases of palms, Lingering, I turn me back, with eyes reverted, To this stepmother world of daily life, As one by some long pleasant dream deserted, That wakes anew to dull unlovely strife. Yet, if none other weal the quest have brought me, The long belovéd labour now at end, This gift of gifts the untravelled East hath brought me, The knowledge of a new and valued friend. 5th Feb. 1889. DUST TO DUST. DEAREST, when I am dead, Fold not this form of mine In webs of wool or silk or linen fine; Nay, pillow not my head, When there is no more breath in me, on down Nor my cold brows with flowers funereal crown. Coffin me not in epicedial elm; Let them not seal My slumbering sense with straitening bands nor whelm My weary body in sepulchral steel. Be not my breathless breast With the accurséd winding-sheet opprest; Let them not lap my nerveless limbs in lead Nor nail me down, Wound, like a wine-flask, in some woolly fleece, Within the choking chest. Indeed, I could not rest, Enchained and prisoned in that narrow bed; I could not sleep Until the term of time be oversped Nor slumber out the appointed years in peace, If left to strangle in that darkling deep. Lay me not in the ground, In some sad city of the nameless dead, Whose heaped-up hosts should let me from the light, Where all about me, under, overhead, Their million multitudes, untold, unknown, Encompassing me round, Pressing and crowding on me day and night, To all eternity should elbow me And straiten me beneath my funeral stone. Enough in life it was with men to be, To see Their smileless faces pass me in the ways, To meet Their senseless eyes, wherein my wistful gaze Could note no noble heat, No hope of heavenly things, no care of right, No heed of aught that is not bought and sold, No thought, no wish, except the greed of gold. Fain in my death from them I would be free. Let them not mar the eternal rest for me, Enforcing me the unvictorious fight Fight on and on for all eternity, Who hunger for deliverance at last From the base present and the bitter past. Not in the earth me lay: I would not moulder lingeringly away Within the stifling clay Nor cower helpless in corruption's hold, Midmost the darkness and the nether cold, A prison-palsied prey To the mean creatures of the middle earth. I would not have my rottenness affray Each delicate flower-birth And cause it shun my foulness of decay. I could not brook to think The lilies or the violets should shrink From my pollution, leaving the fat weed And the base creatures that corruptions breed Alone upon my festering flesh to feed, Nor that the primrose or the cowslip's root, Delving with dainty foot In the earth's bosom for its sustenance, Should flinch and shrivel from my funeral stance, Deeming my mouldering dust not fair and good Enough to be its food. Nay, leave me overground; Let me not lie to perish and to pine Under the mould in some sepulchral mound; But lay me, leave me in the open air; On some wild moorland or some mountain bare, Upon Helvellyn's crown or Snowdon's chine Cast down these bones of mine. There let me moulder underneath the skies; Let the birds batten on my brain and eyes, The wild fox tear me and the forest swine. Yea, let me wither in the wind and rain; The air shall purge me and the sun from stain; The rains shall wash away The soil of death, defilement and decay And the breeze blow me clean and pure and white: Nothing shall be in me to soil the sight, To fright the fancy or the sense affray. The winds shall be the playmates of my dust, As in the air they waft it near and far; The grass its spear-spikes through my ribs shall thrust And the sweet influences of night and day Look loving on me, sun and moon and star. Yea, better far to wither in the wind, To wait the fulness of the days assigned, In the fair face of sky and stars and sun, To feed the flying and the faring things, The creatures in the grass that creep and run, To scatter on the birds' and breezes' wings, To mingle with the sunshiné and the rain And with my breeze-borne ashes germ on germ Of herb and grass and weed To birth of beauty ever and again To bring and help to harvest grain and seed, Than in the clay to moulder, heart and brain, The creatures of corruption there to breed, To rot out tediously the ruthless term And in the dark to feed The foul blind beetle and the writhing worm. There, in the sight of sky and moon and sun, The elements shall garner, one by one, Each gift, each grace they gave, To make this body brave; Let the four work-mates, earth, fire, water, air, Resume again from me That which I had of them and leave me bare; Let all my parts again be what they were, Before the fiat fell for me to be. There, in the course of many a day and night, Some gentian of the height, Some rose, belike, shall blossom from my clay; Some amaryllis of the wind-swept hills, Some pansy, purple as the morning's sills, Some fragrant flush of meadow-sweet, some white Celestial lily of the morning-light, Borne, yet in germ, upon the gracious gale, Whereas I waste away, The fragrances of wordless wistfulness And longing love shall smell, The overmastering spell Of passion disembodied and desire Purged and made pure of life's polluting stress Mark, that my ashes on the air exhale, Nor their sweet seeds and frail Fear to the bosom of my love to trust, Electing so to blossom from my dust And their fair brightness found in my decay. So shall I one anew Be with the natural things I held so dear, One with the sunshine and the waters clear, One with the larks and linnets, flowers and grass, Mountain and moor and torrent, herb and tree, The candid creatures of the air and dew. Nay, in the days to be, It peradventure yet may come to pass That, as your free foot strays Along the moorland or the mountain-ways, Noting the shadows in the brooklet's glass Or following on the interlacing rays That chase each other through the tangled trees, Mayhap it shall be yours to recognize My spirit in the bird-notes and the breeze, My face in flowers, my thought in butterflies, The subtle scions of the sun and skies: Belike, some wandering breath Of perfume, in the summer air afloat, Shall to your senses speak of me in death: Yea, by the brooklet straying, you shall note Some bloom of gold and blue, Some riverside ranunculus, of me That haply shall remember you, shall see Some flowering weed look on you with my eyes Or hear Some windwaft murmur of me in your ear, Some birdsong answer with my speech to you. VERE NOVO. Since the writing (in March last) of this poem, my little Angora cat “Rover,” mentioned in v. 2, has died in her tenth year, to the infinite regret of all who knew her. She was the most loving and engaging of little creatures, far more intelligent than the majority of human beings, and was less to be described as a cat than as half-a-dozen pounds of affection and devotion done up in tabby fluff. Peace to her gentle memory! As Burton says, in the delightful “We and our Neighbours,” (one of the series of homely masterpieces by which the late Mrs. Beecher Stowe well-nigh atoned for her terrible political and literary crime of “Uncle Tom's Cabin”) “One's pets will die, and it breaks one's heart.” OUT in my little garden The crocus is a-flame; The hyacinth-buds harden; The birds no more are tame; No more are they the same That, in the sad snow-season, Their Kyrie Eleison Sang at my window-frame; Lark, linnet, throstle, ousel, With carol and carousal For food to me that came. The winter's woes are over; My cats upon the wall, Gruff, Top, Shireen and Rover, Are basking one and all. Soon will the cuckoo call His “Summer, summer's coming!” Soon will the bees be humming About the tulips tall. The lilac-buds are breaking; A new blithe world is waking, To gladden great and small. I look on all things' gladness, Half-gladdened, half opprest, Delight at once and sadness Debate it in my breast. From out their winter's nest My thoughts peep out at Springtime, Misdoubting of their wing-time, If sleep or wake be best; For in me are two voices, Whereof the one rejoices, The other sighs for rest. I know the old Spring story, That stirs in every flower; How Life grows never hoary, But sleeps to gather power; Then, with some passing shower, Its face it laves from slumber And casting off sleep's cumber, Blooms forth in field and bower, Unresting, still renewing, For evermore ensuing The ever-fleeting hour. Ah Spring, thou tell'st me ever The same contentless tale, How spirit may not sever Fore'er from body frail, How, though the old forms fail, In others yet imprisoned, The soul, anew bedizened With webs of joy and wail, Still from the future's pages Must spell, through endless ages, Life's script of weal and bale. I cannot dight my dreaming To fit thy frolic glee; Thy sweet, thy simple seeming, Thine eager ecstasy Are dulled with doubt for me. I, who am heavy-hearted For days and hopes departed, I cannot joy with thee, Unthoughtful, for the present, Because to-day is pleasant, Of Past and of To-be. Yet, who shall still go glooming, When Spring is on the stair, When every bough is blooming And every field is fair? I stand in the soft air And watch the grasses growing And feel the March-breeze blowing Away my winter's care. A peace, as of sunsetting, Is on me, a forgetting Of joys and griefs that were. This is the Springtide's magic: Needs must, when April's nigh, Its mask of winter tragic The hardest heart lay by; Beneath its watchet sky The saddest soul despairing, The coldest thought leave caring To question how or why; Content, while each day's bringing New birds, new blossoms springing, To live and not to die. PRELUDE TO HAFIZ. HITHER, hither, o ye weary, o ye sons of wail and woe, Ye, who've proved the hollow shimmer of this world of fleeting show, Ye, who've seen your hearts' hopes vanish, like the firstlings of the snow; Ye, who scorn the brutal bondage of this world of misbelief, Ye, who bear the royal blazon of the heart afire with grief, Hearken, hearken to my calling; for I proffer you relief. I am he whom men call teller of the things that none may see, Tongue of speech of the Unspoken, I am he that holds the key Of the treasuries of vision and the mines of mystery. I am he that knows the secrets of the lands beyond the goal, I am he that solves the puzzles of the sorrow-smitten soul, I am he that giveth gladness from the wine-enlightened bowl; I am he that heals the wounded and the weary of their scars, I am Hafiz, son of Shiraz, in the pleasant land of Fars, Where I flung my flouting verses in the faces of the stars. See, my hands are full of jewels from the worlds beyond the tomb: Here be pearls of perfect passion from the middle dreamland's womb; Here be amethysts of solace, for the purging of your gloom: Here be rubies red and radiant, of the colour of the heart, Here be topazes sun-golden, such as rend the dusk apart, Here be sapphires steeped in heaven, for the salving of your smart. If your souls are sick with sorrow, here is that which shall appease; If your lips are pale with passion, here is that which hath the keys To the sanctuaries of solace and the halidomes of ease. Let the bigot tend his idols, let the trader buy and sell; Ears are theirs that cannot hearken to the tale I have to tell, Eyes that cannot see the treasures which are open to my spell. Where is he that's heavy-laden? Lo, my hand shall give him peace. Where are they that dwell in darkness? I am he that can release. Where is he that's world-bewildered? I will give his cares surcease. Hither, hither with your burdens! I have that shall make them light. I have salves shall purge the earth-mists from the fountains of your sight; I have spells shall raise the morning in the middest of your night. Come, o doubt-distracted brother! Come, o heavy-burthened one! Come to me and I will teach you how the goal of rest is won; Come and I will cleave your darkness with the splendours of the sun. Leave your striving never-ending; let the weary world go by; Let its bondmen hug their fetters, let its traders sell and buy; With the roses in the garden we will sojourn, you and I. Since the gladness and the sadness of the world alike are nought, I will give you wine to drink of from the ancient wells of thought, Where it's lain for ages ripening, whilst the traders sold and bought. What is heaven, that we should seek it? Wherefore question How or Why? See, the roses are in blossom; see, the sun is in the sky; See, the land is lit with summer; let us live before we die. THE DOPPER'S LAMENT. PITY the sorrows of a poor Perpetually harassed Boer, The victim of a “beau sabreur”, Who keeps him ever on the stir, Without a moment to entrench. I cannot speak, without a wrench, The ruffian's name; it is such woe To think, with folk who love us so, —Who in their cups cry out, “Bravo! Go on, brave Boers! Do all you know; Avenge the wrongs of Jean Crapaud And lay the brutal Britons low, Those rude Rosbifs who let us crow And only chuckle when we blow!” —This pesky, intermeddling foe Should share the honoured name of “French”. We Doppers love to sleep at night And (if we must) by day to fight, Ensconced behind some rocky height Or sheltered in some cosy trench, Like any other decent mensch: But this chap keeps us on the run From break of day to set of sun, Gives us no time to sleep or eat Or take our schnapps of Hollands neat. (—Washing and change of clothes, indeed, Your true-born Burgher does not need; He, like his sires, the Jews of old, With soap and water does not hold.—) What's death to us is just his fun: Our working day is never done; We get no rest or next to none; For hardly have we closed an eye Ere “Rooineks!” our sentries cry; Putt! Putt! Whiz! Bang! The bullets fly And “Look out there! Come on! Hi! Hi! Give 'em the baggonet, my boys!” And all the other horrid noise Disturbs our dreams of dunghill joys: Here comes that everlasting French! No, hang it all! It is too mean To come upon us, unforeseen, Just when we're settled all serene. I'll write and grumble to the Queen And all the bishops on the bench. Our brother Stead 'twill never suit If honest Burghers cannot loot And Rooineks in comfort shoot, Ambushed behind some rock or root, Without a day-and-night “En route!” From that confounded fellow French. Well, for a wonder, here's no sign Of him just now: I'll stop and dine And after on the veldt recline And smoke the pipe of peace, in fine. Then, when I've had a Dopper drench A “Dopper drench” is composed of Hollands flavoured with a few drops of coffee., If I can find some quiet trench, Just forty winks will come in pat. Good night! I'm off.—But stop! What's that? I heard a sort of rat-tat-tat. Yes! No! It must have been the cat. Lord! There's a shell just where I sat, And here's a bullet through my hat! It cannot be! It is, that's flat, It is that never-ending French. Nov. 1900. REQUIEM FOR OUR DEAD IN SOUTH AFRICA. Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth for evermore. Ecclesiasticus, XLIV, 14. HAPPY are our dead that on the veldt are sleeping, Our dear-belovéd dead, that died for England's sake! They weary not, as we who watch and wake, To follow on the war-tide's ebb and flow, The fluctuant fight against the faithless foe, Nor hear the widows and the orphans weeping. Upon their graves the shadows come and go; Their quiet sleep no battle-thunders break, No shouts of jubilance, no wails of woe: Their seed of sacrifice and duty shed Upon the embattled field and with the red Of their young hearts' blood watered, they lie low And are content to sleep and wait the reaping: They are at peace beneath the moonbeams creeping; They feel the sunblaze not upon their head; They shiver not beneath the winter's snow. They need no pity; all with them is well; O'er them the stars the eternal watch are keeping, The refluent tides of heaven wane and swell; The reverent skies rain softly on their bed: Far oversea, beyond the wild waves' leaping, They rest in peace, our well-belovéd dead. Happy are our dead, that oversea are lying, Our faithful dead, that fought and died to hold us true! They do not hear the rude reviling crew, They hearken not the venal nations vying In slander each with each and vilifying Of that magnanimous England who of yore Wrought for their fathers in the front of war; Who waded for their sakes through seas of gore, Pouring like water forth her blood and store,— England, with Sidney, Howard, Drake, who drew, To free them from the fire and axe of Spain, Her seraph-sword unconquerable, who, With Blake and Marlborough, Nelson, Wellington, From age to age her battle-banner on Bearing, the braggart Bourbon overthrew And drove his harlot-pander cohorts flying, Who to the succour came of Europe sighing Under the brute Republic's bloody reign, Who loosed them from Napoleon's iron chain; England, who heard and answered to their crying So many a time of old and gave them bread;— —These, who, as beasts that bite the hand which fed And give for good, as is the churl's use, bane, Bark at her heels like bandogs,—who, in vain Fair arms and fairly used in loyal fight Knowing against her archangelic might, Catch up the dastard's weapons, filthy lying And shameless slander, and withal adread Lest she should turn and rend them, from afar Hail their envenomed shafts upon her head, Thinking to whelm her with the poisoned rain,— Her tangled in a world-involving war;— These at her heels who follow, fleeing, nighing, Wolves at once fearful of the chase and fain, Whilst she, proud Titan, scornful of replying, Upon her path imperial of domain Fares tireless on with her unfaltering tread, The unsetting sun upon her radiant crest A crown that cleaves the darkness East and West, Nor heeds the yelping of the jackal train. Happy are our dead, thrice happy in their dying, In that their ears are deaf to all is said! They sleep in peace upon the Afric plain; No thunders stir their slumbers nor the hum Of torrent-waters of the tropic rain: They wait the fulness of the days to come, When what they've sown shall gathered be for grain, Nor hearken to the enviers decrying The righteous cause for which they fought and bled. They tarry for the harvest's testifying: 'Tis well with them, our well-belovéd dead. Happy are our dead, o'er whom the grass is growing, Our noble dead, who fought and fell for liberty! Our England's arm who were, from oversea Six thousand miles outstretched for the bestowing Of life upon the sad sons of the soil, Who braved the ambush and the battle-clash, Hunger and thirst and death and dearth and tòil Direr than death, to set the bondman free, To save him from the bullet and the lash,— Who blenched not from the bitterest undergoing, The slave to succour and their human spoil To rescue from the ruthless Dopper dogs, The spawn of Holland, with the Bushman hogs Blood-blended! Where, to all eternity, They lie and sleep beneath the waste-winds blowing, They neither mark the mopping and the mowing Of the sour apes, who, to their country's shame, For that their rivals in the seats they see Themselves must void for incapacity, Spit forth their spite upon our England's name, Their native land far rather in the mire Than themselves choosing forced to the foregoing Of their base aims and baulked of their desire,— Nor heed the tattling of the traitor horde, Who, to feed full their raging vanity, Their vile vainglorious appetites to stay And fill their lust of hate to overflowing, With the foul foe for England's overthrowing Confederate, fain would blunt her conquering sword And maim her forearm. But what matter they? What skill such screech-owls in the imperial choir Of England's praise, that, like a living lyre, Circles the echoing world from East to West, Hailing her harbinger of peace and truth, Sword of the just and shield of the opprest, Time-honoured temperer of wrath with ruth? Yet, happy, happy are our dead, unknowing The shame our own have heaped upon our head, The tares which these have mingled with their sowing Who died for duty at their country's hest, Tares with their wheat which shall be harvested, To feed the future world with bitter bread! 'Tis well they know it not; 'twould stir their rest Untimely, ere the appointed days be sped, The term of time fulfilled and truth's forthshowing: 'Tis well they sleep, our dear and sacred dead. Happy are our dead, that in our hearts are living, Our holy dead, who died to hold us true and great! Whatever lie beyond the years in wait, Whatever webs the future may be weaving, Theirs shall the glory be, for theirs the giving. 'Twas they that stemmed for us the storm of hate; 'Twas they that turned for us the tides of Fate: Ours was the wreck; but theirs was the retrieving; They gave us all and asked for no returning, Fought on nor looked to know the darkness burning With the bright signs of morning or to see The dayspring and the dawn of victory. Enough their faith for them and the believing That England never from her fair estate Should fail whilst yet her lion brood should be, Each breast a bulwark in her foremost gate, Strong with the strength of duty for the achieving Of the impossible by land and sea, Each one a little England, unafraid To face the world in arms, where England bade. Theirs is the triumph; ours is the bereaving; The trophy theirs; ours but the broken blade, The bloodstained arms, for love and memory laid, Wet with our weeping, on the narrow bed Whereas our heroes sleep, of doubt and dread Absolved, of sorry thought and sad conceiving. So leave we them to rest; but, in the leaving, Let not their perfect peace our mourning mar; Let not our tears upon their triumph jar. They live and shall not die! Whilst England stands Upon the Eastern and the Western strands, The light of virtue haloing her head, Crowned, from the morning to the evening-red, Queen of the Orient and the Austral lands, The memory of their deeds shall never die: Whilst “England liveth yet!” it shall be said, Defying Time that maketh low and high, This one downsetting still and that upheaving, They shall live on with England. Far and nigh, Their names shall shine as polestars in her sky, Till she and all her memories are sped. Leave them to rest; there is no need of grieving. Sleep on in peace, our unforgotten dead! Fan. 1902. BASSARID'S HORN. (From “The Book of Hercules”.) “The Book of Hercules,” here mentioned, is an unfinished epic upon the subject of the life and death of the great legendary successor of Prometheus, from which this song and “The Last of Hercules” (v. Vol. I, 363) are excerpts. Whether it will ever be completed is “upon the knees of the Gods.” YOUNG, fair land, Robe thyself with flowers; arise and shine! Spring, that holdst the summer in the hollow of thy hand, Come, for the sweetness of the year is thine. Amethyst sea, Blossom and birdsong have burst their winter's graves: See, in the distance the month of storms doth flee: Laugh with the lucent sapphire of thy waves. Soul of man, Shake off thy sadness, for the Spring is here. Mark how the meadows have braved the winter's ban; Glow with the gladness of the newborn year. NOCTURN. THE moon looks in upon me through the casement And creeping round to where I lie at gaze, Wide-eyed, and wait in vain coy sleep's embracement, Upon my face her ghostly fingers lays. I know that sign; she wills me rise and follow Her feet; she lures me with her lamp of white, Till at the window, o'er the wooded hollow, I stand and look upon the silver night. Pale lies the world and pure as a dead maiden; No birdsong breaks the silence, thrush or merle: The woodlands lie and slumber, heavy-laden With dreams, beneath a dreaming sea of pearl. From out that moony sea how many a hoping Fain would I raise, that is for ever sped; I go among old memories seeking, groping For what I know is buried with the dead. Still the moon calls me. What to wait availeth For sleep unanswering? Better forth to go, To wander 'twere, before her fair light faileth, Before her horn th' horizon dips below. White moon, thou ever wast my friend and lover; Ne'er have I asked in vain for aid from thee; Still all my toils and troubles didst thou cover And drown'dst my sorrows in thy silver sea. The doors stand barless all; the gates are gaping; The ways are open to the open night, Fulfilled with figures of the moonlight's shaping: So forth I fare into a world of white. In the wild park I stray, where all is sleeping, Save in the dreaming avenue of elms, Where down the moonlit aisles the ghosts are sweeping, That may not rest in sleep's sepulchral realms. Like me, they watch and wake whilst all else sleepeth; Like me, the backward, not the forward ways, They tread; like me, they sow when all else reapeth; Like me, they love the nights and not the days. Like me, outsetting know they, not arriving; Like me, the night's their day, the moon their sun; Like me, for ever, ever are they striving To make the done undone, the undone done. Among the ghosts I wander, dreaming, deeming, Mid ghosts and dreams myself a dreaming ghost, In the loud world of men a thing of seeming, A wandering wraith amid a living host. The silence solace brings to thought and feeling; The quiet fills my bleeding heart with balm; The moon upon my wounds pours oils of healing; My cares are half-forgotten in the calm. But lo! across the hills the dark is breaking; The breeze of dawn sighs shrilly through the trees; The world, so sweet that slept and dreamt, is waking, To run its round of travail and unease. And thou, who needst must wake, whilst others slumber, Who, whilst all rest, the weapon-watch must keep, Will the blue morning quit thee of thy cumber? Shall the day wind thee in the woofs of sleep? Nay, for thou ever wast a doubter, dreamer, And he whose feet the paths of vision tread Was ever out of grace with Sleep the Seemer; She hath no crown of poppies for his head. BARCAROLLE. OUT sails to the fresh breeze! My heart Pines for the open seas. The soft moon flowers, like a dream-delight, Over the full tide-flow. Shake out the sails! Sweetheart, we will depart, We will depart and sail the seas to-night, Whilst on the foam that flees The blithe breeze flutters and the weed floats slow, The moon above us and the tide below. Where shall we steer to-night? The moon Lies, like a lane of white, Far out beyond our vision in the West, Over the dreaming sea, As if some goddess walked with silver shoon Over the dimples of each white-winged crest. Sweetheart, the way is bright: Shall we trim sails and follow it till we Win to some shimmering world of fantasy? Folk hold we chase a dream; They say That the bright worlds, which beam Beyond the setting and the dying day, Are shows begotten of the air and light, Delusions distance-woven for the sight, Mere mirages, that seem And flee before us with unceasing flight: We lose our lives, they tell us, following A vain, unreal thing. 'Twere better far to bide On shore, To delve the round earth's side For diamonds and golden glittering store And in the strife for wealth and worldly praise Join, heaping up the treasure of the days With great and goodly store Of what men follow in the mortal ways; Since, as they say, these only real are And all things else unreal as a star. What matter what they say? We know That which on dullards' way They prate but of, as idiots do, who go, Strange spells and magic words without comprize Reciting, which, if spoken wizard-wise, Would overthrow The world and rend with ruin earth and skies: We soar, whilst here below they herd like sheep; We waken, whilst they sleep. For them, dull life once o'er, They lie And rot for evermore; There is no part of them but all must die, Since all their thoughts are earthy as their dust, Their spirits as their bodies rust in rust; No hope have they, on high To raise them, but for ever perish must: What shall avail to lift them from the grave Of all that here they crave? With them what shall they bear Away, Into the nether air, Of all the goods they garner night and day? Shall they regild death's darkness with their gold? Shall their wealth warm them in the utter cold, Their honour cleave the clay? Will the worm do them worship in the mould? Nay, earth to earth and dust to dust must back; With life, all else shall lack. But we, whose kingdom is not of the earth, Whose weal No world of death and birth Might work nor fill the yearnings that we feel, Our visions overlasting life and death, Our dreams that cease not with the 'scape of breath, From us death cannot steal The splendour and the fulness of our faith; We bear with us into the realms of Night The seeds of life and light. Not of the dust our hope, Our thought, That soars beyond earth's scope. If here it gain the glories not it sought, Itself its warrant is that such things are, That the bright visions, here from us afar Which flee, are not for nought; Nay, though it be beyond the topmost star, Our dreams, that seem delusions, simple sooth Are in the air of truth. Since here our each desire, Fulfilled, Becomes a wasting fire, A mocking counterfeit of what we willed, Thrice happy they who chase some Golden Fleece, Beyond man's wit, who seek without surcease Some vision that they build, Some lovely land of everlasting peace, Who, after some divinest dream, o'erstray The strands of night and day! Come, then, launch out with me And steer Into the shoreless sea! Shake out the sails and follow without fear Into the distance and the golden West! We yet shall sight the Islands of the Blest; We yet the Hesperian Gardens of our quest Shall compass, if not here, In this our world of ravin and unrest, Then in those lands of a serener air Where truth alone is fair. ARCADES AMBO. BIRDS at morning-red Each to other said, “See, the winter's over; Soon it will be Spring.” But, before the night, All the world was white And each feathered rover For the South a-wing. Quoth my heart one day, “Love is come to stay: Soul, have done with sorrow; Give thyself to glee.” But, ere day was done, Light Love with the sun Fled, and on the morrow, Woe, ah woe was me! Quoth the bud at morn, “With my girth of thorn, Who shall do me evil? Am I not the rose?” But, alack to tell! Ere the midnight fell, Came a frost uncivil And the blossom froze. Quoth I to my soul, “Thou hast reached thy goal: Me no more importune With thy doubts and fears.” But, ere I had spoken, Lo! the spell was broken; With a back-blow, Fortune Turned my smiles to tears. IMPERIA V. Les Contes Drôlatiques de Balzac, “La Belle Imperia Mariée.” (A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT.) NAY, I am tired of kisses: let us sit Awhile, that I may look into thine eyes And watch the fair full dawning of desire Flower out to passion. Nay, I prithee, rest; I would not have thee kiss me yet awhile, Lest the one sweetness mar the memory, Sweeter than life, of that which went before. Dear, dost thou love me? Nay, sweet, answer not. 'Tis but a lovers' litany, that needs Responsion but as some half drowsy drone Of Aves humming through the silver sound Of the thrilled pipes, when the full hymn floats up And all the incense shrivels up the nave; An asking of a thing that is too sure To need assurance, ay, that takes affright And doubts, if one be careful to assure. How long a season is it since we met And looked upon and knew each all to each And the world turning on our dual selves? How long, my love? These few, short, golden years, A whisper of the wind through orange groves, Lit with the lamps of months and days and hours, All fed with some sweet perfumed oil of praise, Burnt to our love? Or else these many lives, These long, full, dreamy, interfluent lives Of termless time, that flow beside the years, Around, between, before and after them, Eking our pauses of unfilled accords With complements of strange, sweet harmony. Tell me, fair lord! Or rather, tell me not: I will not have thee speak nor break the spell That, like a flower, sits on thy happy lips, Holding the silence with a scent of peace. I will speak for thee, with thy hand in mine, Nestling, a dove laid in a dove's white breast, And thine eyes sacring me thy best belov'd, With that full benediction of calm peace That I do live by. I have never known So whole an environment of content, So golden an investiture of peace And confidence as this that is on me To-day; I have a sweetness at my heart, An autumn glory of accomplished hope, As of a soul that, with its whole wish won, Sees Death come walking to it over flowers And smiles for gladness of perfected peace And pity of the sad condemned to live. And to such folk, 'tis said, comes memory, A fair young child, and takes them by the hand And leads them, blithe and crowned with mystic palms, Along the backward ways; and there they note The by-gone landmarks overgrown with flowers Of fair fulfilment and the rude wild wastes, Where erst they wandered, sighing to the winds And casting seeds of longing and despair, Of hope and love and dole on every side, Clad like a bride with many-coloured robes Of blooms imperial. So it is with me; For thus it seems full bliss doth mimic death, Being alike fruition. Sit, my love, And I will sing to thee some sweet sad song, To spite our happiness; or, soothlier, I will e'en tell thee yet once more again The story of my life and how I grew And fashioned forth myself, expecting thee; Yet once again, of all these many times; For, in my thought, each time I tell it thee, I do once more reconquer me thy love, Seeing it is to me like some fair fire, That lights the backward and the forward ways, Upon some travelled highway. Hearken, then. I do remember, when I was a child, A little, pale-faced child with eyes all wide With the new wonder of the mystic world, My thoughts were ever strained toward some mist Of hope unformed, that should, in days to come, Flower forth to wish. I was scarce fain to sport And laugh and frolic as my fellows were, Uncareful of the hopes the future held; Nay, I was ever seeking for myself The strange and solemn mysteries of things Common and everpresent, yet unknown. I could not touch another playmate's hand Nor look into another's round void eyes, The laughing, tearful eyes of infancy, But something, that I comprehended not, Stole through my veins and caused the sudden blood Invade my visage and the nerves of life Thrill as a harp thrills to the passing touch Of the pale sprites that wander down the winds Of night. I would build palaces of dreams About some idle, vain, unanswering thing, Twine wreaths of strange affection round the brows Of some rough, careless mate, that half endured And half repelled my timorous caress. Or, failing these, I made some flighty goat, Some silly kindly sheep my heart's delight And loved the unresponsive world in it, Decking its coyness with my childish toys, Ribbons and beads and such like foolish gear. LITANY. NIGHT and day and work and play, time and toil and thrall, Shade and sun for all and one, death for one and all: Watch and ward and chain and cord, rose and thorn and rue, Fence and fate and bolt and gate; time and thought fare through. Smile and tear and hope and fear still for you and me; Love and life and sleep and strife; faith alone wins free. Day and night and dark and light, sea and shore and sky, Wealth and dearth: farewell to earth! Time it is to die. Life and Love about, above, flutter to and fro; Long they're sought and once they're caught, time it is to go. All as one, the ripe years run, hasten to the night: Feed thy fill, whilst lingers still, still a little light. Hap and hope! In heaven's scope is how many a star! Thick as bees they swarm and these even as we are. What availing is in wailing or in railing, what? If Life's weaving be deceiving, death shall cut the knot. Joy is folly, melancholy idle: better be Sea-birds sleeping on the leaping billows of the sea. What's to do with me and you, in this world of dream? Moth and fly are you and I, motes in the sun-beam. Strife and seeming, doubt and deeming, let them play their play, Let them flutter out their utter term and pass away. If thy bosom bear a blossom, cherish it and heed Not the jealous fools that tell us Love is but a weed. Pain and pleasant, past and present, future, friend and foe, All Life's weaving, glee and grieving, must thou leave and go. Wheel and windle, spool and spindle, let them weave and spin; Let them wind us what assigned us is, day out, day in. Sweet and bitter, gold and flitter, all must have its day; Little matter on Life's platter what for us they lay. Vain contending, world-amending, dreams of sleep and wake: Life's whole beauty is in duty done for duty's sake. Cease thy sighing: day is dying, see, in yonder West: Yet a little, in sleep's spital thou, too, shalt have rest. LOVE SOLICITOUS. LOVE, perfect love, The loved Apostle tells us, casts out fear. Ah, thou belovéd of the Lord, that hate Nor doubt despiteful knewest, being here, Whose hopes in heaven above Alone had harbourage, who still await Watched for Christ's coming through the golden gate Of morn miraculous, straining with bent ear For the first trumps of the Accepted Year, What should thy heart, elate With the sure hope of heaven at hand and near, Know of the iron laws of loveless Fate, Which ban content and cheer From those who anywhat on earth hold dear, Dooming them still misdoubt, all else above, The loss of that they cherish, soon or late, So fearlessness their joys may have for mate Nor peace? Peace! What hath that celestial dove, Which broodeth but on Faith's serener sphere, To do with Love? In this our sorry scheme of things create, Is not incertitude Love's born estate? Are not its sacrifices sigh and tear? Is it not unto doubt as hand to glove? He better knew The laws and statutes of Love's mystery, The Roman singer, in like time with thee, By the cold shores of the Cimmerian Sea Who lived and sighed for Latium's skies of blue And his lost love's embrace; Or he, the Tusculan, who did abase, In the last days of Rome's democracy, His golden speech the senseless populace To raise rebellious 'gainst the Fates' decree Which bids these servants and those masters be. Well of Love's ordinance he wotted who, Far from the loved sight of his lady's face, Weaving his wreaths of rue, Love all fulfilled of anxious fear “Res est soliciti plena timoris amor.” —Ovid, Her. I, 12. did see; Or he Who, yearning back unto his youthful case, When all the world was new In his new eyes and over lawn and lea The pleasant hours the pleasanter did chase, Love all for sorrow and anxiety, “Quam sit omnis amor solicitus et anxius.” —Cicero ad tticum, II, 25. Solicitude unceasing, did beshrew, Inapt for those who run the worldly race, Concernless being never nor care-free, To one and all untrue. Yet, who were fain, For all Love's miseries and all affrays, To think that he its ravishments had missed? Who would for woe desist From loving? Who, because he'd felt Love's bane, Would, in his loveless age, that he had kissed And clipt in brighter days forget again? For lightning-stroke and thunder, storm and blaze, Who would sweet summer banish its domain? Who list The flowered Spring forbear for wind and rain? More than the Galilean votarist, Awatch to see, across the Egean main, Christ's kingdom flower through the morning mist, More than the Sulmonéan rhapsodist, Still sighing, 'neath the chill Cimmerian rays, For the rebirth of the Saturnian reign, More than the Volscian revolutionist, Rehearsing ever to the Alban ways The time he swayed the commons with his hist, More than the Syrian and the Romans twain, Yea, most of all who sing its pleasant praise, Of Love and all its mysteries he wist, Our English amorist, Well skilled the tangles of the wildering maze Of loveful thought to loose and wind again, Our minnesinger of the latter days, Who said, nor said in vain, “All other pleasures are not worth its pain.” SUNSET-VOICES. I. THERE came a voice to me, When the sun was like a star, In the distance far away; It spoke of worlds afar, Beyond the sapphire sea, Beyond the dying day. Of other worlds it told, Where Life and Love are one, In some serener air; Of shores beyond the sun, Behind the evening-gold, Where truth alone is fair; Where one are thought and deed, Where wish and will consent, Where care comes not to blur The face of fair intent Nor faith's upspringing seed Is baulked by falsehood's bur; Where all our darling dreams, Which died, whilst yet in leaf, Shall know a brighter birth, Where gladness pure from grief, Where all is what it seems And heaven unhemmed with earth. II. Ah, vain, ah vaunting voice, That wak'st my wounded heart And mak'st it bleed again! Yet must I needs rejoice To hear thy speech, that art My faded hopes' refrain. For better, better far To look and long and sigh For some ideal thing, To love some distant star, Than chase, with churl and king, Life's ever-changing lie! Come back, come back to me And murmur in my ear Your melodies of yore, O visions dread and dear, O hopes of heaven in store, Of Paradise to be! For, since in one decay Both good and ill must meet, Why then, let run to waste The dreams that were so sweet? Why cast the cup away, If transient its taste? Since sun and stars and sky, Since heaven and sea and land Are mirages of sight, Which melt, when close at hand, And all which meets the eye But visions of the night, Why, then, ah, why disdain Delusions fond and fair, Delights that do but seem? Come back, sweet shapes of air, And make my days again A dream within a dream. TRINITAS TRINITATUM. LOVE is best: To lie and rest, Cradled on some darling breast, What is sweeter, What completer Peace in all the perimeter Of this round of nights and days? Go thy ways, World of weariness and madness, Passing glee and poisoned gladness, Ceasing cheer and staying sadness, Nought have I to do with thee. Play thy plays With other preys; Love is all in all to me. Peace is best: O heavenly guest, North and South and East and West, What is fairer, What is rarer, For the weary, footworn farer Of the ways of sea and land, Than thy hand Laid upon his forehead's burning, Than to find, in his returning, From his spirit stress and yearning, From his deeming doubt and care Barred and banned, At thy command, Sorrow silenced, foul made fair? Sleep is best: In slumber's nest, All forgotten, strife and quest, What is fitter, What is better For the weary would-be setter Of this world, the crooked, straight? Ope thy gate, Bird of bliss, and sooth my sorrow; From thy treasure bid me borrow Dreams of some serener morrow, Where with beauty one is truth: Snatch me straight From age and hate To the lands of love and youth! Whether best Must be confessed? Love, peace, sleep, the palm contest. Love is sweetest, Peace is meetest, Sleep for sage and fool is featest: Each divine is: but the three, Met together in one treasure, To the height fill up the measure Of the heart's ideal pleasure. Be all three into one sheaf Bound for me By fate's decree, And I'll scoff at glee and grief. DE PROFUNDIS. COME, o ye nights and ye days of entrancement, Back to my call! Ye, with whose help for my spirit's enhancement, Once I knew not what the strokes of mischance meant, Feared not to fall; Once had I youth, love and hope at my bidding, Faith to enforce me 'gainst Fortune's forbidding; Once was I ringed with resolve for the ridding Thought of Time's thrall. Now from me youth, love and hope have departed; Left am I lonely and weariful-hearted, Beggared of all. Once was I buttressed and bastioned with dreaming, Fenced from affray, Vantaged with visions in glory still gleaming, Fortressed of fancy 'gainst striving and seeming, Doubt and dismay. Now from my slumber, alack! I awaken, Find myself lonely, forlorn and forsaken, All that I cherished to flight having taken, Fleeted away. Fate of my loves, one and all, hath bereft me, All my bright mates have betrayed me and left me Naked to-day. Where, oh my dreams and my visions, ah whither, Where did ye fly? Hither, again, oh ye runagates, hither Come at my cry! See, my soul sorrows, my bosom is bleeding; Sore is my sufferance, utter my needing: Surely ye will not pass by me, unheeding, Leave me to die, Me that have fostered you, cherished you, cared for you, When all the world was a desert unshared for you, All passed you by! Yet, if ye will not restore me, or may not, Aught of increase, If Fate's foreordinance summon you stay not, Force you to cease, For the sweet life's sake of old that I led with you, By the wild ways that my spirit did tread with you, Give me again my soul's angel that fled with you, White-wingèd Peace! Render me back the mild magic that made me, Midmost the toils and the woes that waylaid me, Gideon's fleece! A GHAZEL OF SPRING. THE bird of the morning pipes in the perfumed meads of Spring: What shall the lips of the lover do in the May but sing? What shall the heart of the poet do in the prime but hope, When loosed are the locks of winter and Love in the land is King? The larks are aloft in heaven; the finches flute on the bough; The brakes are alive with birdsong, the meadows with blossoming. The heart of the dreamer panteth with passion; his thought is thrilled With glory of coming summer and gladness of harvesting: He heareth the cuckoo calling; he scenteth the rose afar; He sees in the golden distance the cornfields glittering: He seeth the ruby clusters aglow on the ripening vines: 'Twixt summer and Spring and autumn his wish is wavering. The world from the wrack of winter rejoiceth redeemed to be; The sweet of the year is swelling in every living thing; The glee of the merry Maytime is glowing in every vein; There's never a man but the poet that goeth pondering. Since lover and dreamer revel, since blossom and bird rejoice, Since all men acclaim the Maytime with carol and pipe and string, What aileth the sorry singer that he hath no heart to joy, That he to the new sweet season alone hath no song to sing? Alack! for the doom he knoweth that doggeth the merry May; He knoweth the woes of winter tread hard on the heels of Spring: He knoweth the frost-times follow the track of the flowered year; He knoweth the autumn cometh and setteth the birds a-wing. Ye tell him in vain that winter will pass as the Spring hath past; That May, with the year's returning, new blossoms and birds. will bring: The joys that are dead, he knoweth, will never again relive; The hearts that are sere will never again know flowering: Whatever the future bring us, whatever the new time bear, It cannot with morning's glamour regild our evening. Though bright be the blooms it proffer, though perfect its linnets' lilt, It is not our flowers that flourish, it is not our birds that sing: They all with our bygone gladness are fled to another clime And there with our hopes are waiting another sun-rising. ‘Tis thus that the poet goeth alone in the May and mute, When highway and hill with revel and meadow and moorland ring; ‘Tis thus that, when men are merry and all in the land are glad, When mad is the world with music and fragrance and flowering, His eyes, betwixt past and future, are blind to the blaze of noon; His heart and his soul are haunted with thoughts of another Spring, With dreams of that mother-country where life shall lie down to rest, Where peace shall be had for passion and silence for sorrowing. SOLITUDINEM FACIUNT..... SILENCE on the sea, Silence in the sky, Nought aloof, a-lee, Not a cloud on high; Emptiness on every hand, Nothing far and nigh. In this soul of me Neither smile nor sigh; All, for grief and gree, Gone and fleeted by; Nothing left of life and love, Nothing but to die. Once, afar, anear, Waves ran high and low; Once, now dark, now clear, Heaven above did show; Once a live sky frowned and smiled O'er a live tide-flow. Once, with hope and fear Filled, my life did go; Once, with smile and tear Bloomed my heart ablow; Once with grief and gladness throbbed. Was it better so? Fain the sea had been Then unstirred and still; Fain the sky serene Then had been at will; Fain o'er stirless sea had heaven Flawless stretched its fill. Fain I then had seen Peace from good and ill, Peace from high and mean, Peace from throb and thrill, Fain from joys that waste had been Free and griefs that kill. Breeze no more and blast Now the ocean crease; Heaven no more o'ercast Is by fleck or fleece; Sky and sea are blank of wane Now and of increase. Now from life, at last, Hath my soul release; Now my thoughts from past And from future cease; Now in nothingness I have Peace; but is it peace? BIRD-PEEP. THE birds beset me in the mists of morning, The chill thin twilight of the dawning day, A note of urgence, bidding, chiding, warning, Is in their lay. “Arise!” So runs the burden of their flyting; “And to the morrowing day our matins share; For better far,” they say, Mohammed citing, “Than sleep is prayer. “Up, sluggard, up! The night is near its neaptide; The morning shimmers through the shallowing mirk: The hour is here that turns the sullen sleeptide To wake and work.” Begone, ye wanton, over-early wakers, Nor tear my tired ears with your shrilling call! If you have had your twelve hours' sleep, wiseacres, Not so with all. Nay, some like me there be who have no choosing, Who cannot sleep when all are slumbering, Who needs must watch and wake, whilst you are snoozing, Head under wing. Fain must they snatch their sleep, when all are waking, Who, when all sleep, must watch, whose night is day, Their scanty stint of rest and ease how taking And when they may. And as for prayer, forsooth, methinks the chatter, With which you rend sleep's cobweb-subtle woof, No more like prayer is than the pitter-patter Of rain on roof. Go preach to those who but by day burn eyelight: Your rede for those whose nights for slumber be, O pert Muezzins of the morning twilight, Is, not for me. For me, who watch in this lugubrious London, All-nightly wandering in the ways of wake, Seeking the undone done, the done things undone Again to make; For me, whose prayer is work, whose lauds are labour, Who watch the white stars scale the long sky-steep, More excellent (permitting noise and neighbour) Than prayer is sleep. A LAST LULLABY. INTO the rose-worlds of reverie, fairest, come follow me; Cleave with me close to the skirts of the slackening day: Be, ere the billows of blissfulness shadow and swallow me, Hand in hand, heart in heart, woven with me for the Way. Hark, on the strings of the harp of the sunsetting breezes, Wafted, the voice of the Viewless for burden is borne, Willing us steer with the sun to the lands where love's ease is, Fare with night's feet to the shores of the shadowless morn! Far in the fathomless gold upon gold of the setting, See, where the love-lands arise from an ocean of rest, Havens of peace and of healing, fiords of forgetting, Ports of soul-solacement, infinite isles of the blest! There, in those meadows and harbours of azure unmeasured, Sojourns of sorrow sublimed and of peace after pain, There not a dream of our days and our nights but is treasured, There not a hope of our hearts but is garnered again. See, where the dear ones of old, of whom death hath bereft me, All who forewent me in faring the shadow-ward ways, All their fair faces, the friends who have loved me and left me, Shine in the hovering sheen of the sunsetting haze! Hark, how they call to me! See, how they beckon and sign to me, Bidding me launch with the light on the westering wave, Lapse from this life, which was ever but passion and pine to me, Steer to the shores where the peace is, the rest which I crave! Hear'st thou, my soul, how they hail from the sunsetting towers? Seest how they beckon me sever from bondage and strife? Feel'st how my feet are impelled by invisible powers? Thou alone holdest me fast in the fetters of life. 'Ware of the waves and the breezes, that watch to bereave thee! Hold thou my hand, lest I drown in the halcyon deep: Clip thou me close, O thou love of my loves, lest I leave thee, Drawn of the dreams, lest I sink in the surges of sleep! What, O my heart, were heav'n worth to me, save thou wert there with me? Even to Paradise will me not pass without thee. Come with me, comfort me, company, follow and fare with me; Steer my soul's bark through the brume and the surge of Death's sea. EVENSONG. ONE by one, The pale years pass; One by one, in being's glass Drop the sands of time, unheeded, Till the appointed term be run. Faith hath fallen sere, unseeded; Love is left to waste, unweeded: What's to do with Life's unneeded Moon and sun? Were but life To live again, Sure, we fable, we were fain Follow it on other fashion Than the old of thrall and strife; With more reason and less passion It for the long road we'd ration, Less contention, more compassion, Ruth more rife. Good of gain Should take the place; Gentleness should go with grace Hand in hand in our new being, Were our lives to live again: Faith from fears should serve for freeing, Ears for hearing, eyes for seeing, Hands for holding, feet for fleeing Peace and pain. All above, In this our new Life, contentment we'd ensue, All the world to hope embolden With the lodestar of our love; Cause a-brood to be beholden O'er the world-all Peace, the olden Eyes of light and pinions golden Heaven's dove. All the hours Of life we'd fill With the wonders of our will; Earth, with glories new, should, gleaming, Bring to birth new fruits and flowers: Certitude we'd win for seeming, Faith fulfilled for doubt and deeming, Wake to life and love this dreaming World of ours. Darling dreams, Before the day That must pale and pass away, Flowers of fancy never blowing But by Paradisal streams, Grains that germ from no man's sowing, Will ye evermore be showing Us, with glories new still glowing, What but seems? Yet ye fill Our straining eyes With your dreams of brighter skies, From Life's bald and barren stubble Golden cornfields conjure still, With the world-illusion's bubble Fool us yet, lest, toil and trouble Tired, we turn and burst Life's double Web of Will. Yet repine Thou not, sad soul, If the golden glittering goal Never, from the mists unweaving, On thy ravished vision shine. Better gladsomeness than grieving, Better than misdoubt believing And deception than deceiving Is, in fine. Think not shame For thy defeat: Were thy visions vain, though sweet, But the noble thus mistaken Were, since life to light first came. Hold thy heart in hope unshaken: Hapless those who, faith-forsaken, Find their dreams, when they awaken, But a name! Have no dole For thy dead dream. Though thou sawst what did but seem, There shall flower from thy failing Hope for many a hapless soul; Solacement to still his wailing, Confidence to quell his quailing, Faith to hold his heart availing White and whole. One by one, The days fill up, Drop by drop, the Future's cup. Hold thy hopes of right unrended By the lapse of moon and sun; Like the sentinel, watch ended, Conscience clear, approof-attended, Pass to rest, work wrought, way wended, Duty done. THE GRAVE OF MY SONGS. BYTIMES, from out the stillness of my days, Grown silent, as they nigh The darkness and the undiscovered ways, I hear folk question why The fountain of my songs, that once ran high And full, is fallen dry; Why in that concert of the fields and hills Of poesy, that fills Our English heaven with music never mute, There is one broken lute, One voiceless bird, One linnet of the woods, whose wilding note, Erst in the morning hours of some that heard Held sweet, is dumb within his stricken throat, Ere yet the glory of the noon be o'er,— Whose song, though day still shines, is heard no more. —They ask in very idleness nor pause For answer; yet the cause Who will may know: My voice is dumb for weariness of woe. I am no night-bird piping in the dark; For me, as for the lark, The sun must rise to set me on the wing: Except hope shine on me, I cannot sing: I cannot carol in a lightless land Nor hymn the dawn, except it be at hand. Love was my dayspring and my evenglow, The sun that set my April blossoming, That made my summer carolful; and lo! My daystar set in darkness long ago. My sun lies buried in a nameless tomb, Midmost a mighty desert of the dead, Where the great city's gloom Lengthens its skirt of shadow overhead, Darkening the morning and the evening-red. There, in the narrow room, After long pain and many a piteous day Of hopeless waiting for the hopeless end, Since love nor care might bend The iron course of fore-appointed doom, Her weary head to lay She came, for whom my songs were sung of yore, For whom the barrens of my life ran o'er With lush and lavish bloom. Since that sad day, my songs are turned to sighs; The flowerage of my heart is all fordone: But she, the eternal rest so hardly won, At peace she lies And sleeps as well, frail lover of the sun, Beneath our English skies, Our pallid skies of watchet-chequered dun, As if she lay where the rose-laurels run Adown Grenada's hillside, torrent-wise, Or where, amidst the Andalusian vines, The rosy gold of Seville's turrets shines. Ah, what is left us of the dear-loved dead? The dainty gold-fledged head, The eyes' soft gray, From which the dreams of childhood never fled; The mouth's rose-campion red, The lips, on which the faint smile sat alway, Sad as the break of April's youngest day; The rose-blush cheeks and forehead, garlanded With clustering curls astray, Like woodbind tendrils in the flush of May; The voice, too soft for joy, too sweet for pain, That in its blithest tone Had yet some note of never-ceasing moan, Some half-enchanted strain, As of some sad embodied spirit, fain To be set free again From this waste world, that never was its own, Since in some clime unknown The airs and flames of heaven to it were blown? These hath Time taken back to its treasury, In other worlds, mayhap, alas! but ne'er In this of night and day reborn to be: Nay, all are gone and even memory Will fade of what they were. Might we but deem some lapse of land and sea, Some brighter sky Should bring these back to heart and ear and eye, These that in death's hand lie! Ah God, to see the daisies springing there, Year after year, as if life ne'er should die, And see no sign and know no reason why Her life that was so fair, Her soul, that was so sweet, so heavens-high, Is faded out for e'er Into the deserts of the abysmal air! Could we but hope the all-engrossing earth, That for the eternal rest Took back her blighted beauty to its breast, Might yet enrich our dearth With some unknown, enchanted wonder-birth Of blossom, brilliant as her starry eyes, Sweet as her balmy breath, Some flowerage of heaven defying death, Wherein our yearning memory might retrace The frankness of her face, In whose bright beauty thought might recognize The spirit-prime of her lost loveliness, Born as it were again In some new earth, delivered from the press Of mortal grossness by the purge of pain,— Or might we deem the unresponsive air, —That bore her gentle spirit far away And scattered it for aye Beyond the confines of the night and day, To all the winds of being, nor would e'er Vouchsafe to our despair One echo of her voice's dulcet strain,— Should yet grow great with graciousness and bear Some mystic birth of music strange and fair, Some seraph-song of Paradisal bird, Some melody of mortals never heard, Wherein her silver speech And the far memory of her voice might reach Our longing ears and witness to our faith, She was not all disfeatured by the scaith Of unrespective death, That something of her sweetness yet survives In interstellar lands Or in the sunset-calm of spirit-lives, Nor was all scattered by the 'scape of breath! Nay, hope is vain; in vain our lifted hands! In vain our cryings storm the heaven's stair: There are no ears to hearken anywhere, No lips to speak in answer to our prayer. The heavens are empty as the empty air; The Gods are dead as she is dead and nought Abides of her but thought In one man's brain, who soon himself must go To join the unnumbered nations that lie low In that untravelled land where thought is none And sight is senseless there of star and sun. One sole man's thought against the grim array Of Death and Fate her only hope and stay, Her one Frail-seeming fortalice! And yet, how slight Soe'er it show against the iron might Of the blind Titans of oblivion, Methinks it shall suffice for many a day To hinder Time's decay From blotting out her traces; yea, despite The myriad graves that let her from the light, Th'innumerable throngs That overcrowd her of the nameless dead, Remembrance still shall blossom o'er her head And guard her gentle memory from Time's wrongs; For in that narrow bed With her my heart lies buried and my songs. If you should find the hidden violet there, Soft'ning the smoky air With that sad scent of hers, that seems to hold The very soul of tears, or see the mould Lit with the lucent gold Of thronging primrose,—if the breeze should bear The roses' royal breath And lilies white, The fair flower-angels with the heart of light, With jessamines unite To glorify that darkling garth of death,— Think not these are but flowers, The common creatures of the sun and showers: Nay, these are no mere scions of the Spring, No Summer's blossoming, The tired earth's homage to the lengthening hours; These are the secret treasures of my prime, My hoards of love and rhyme, Which, did she live, were songs, but, she being dead, Are flowers above her head. If you should marvel there to hear the lark Sunder the morning-dark With that shrill clarion-call of his for light, Out of the deeps of night, Or mark the mavis and the ousel make Their wild free music there for April's sake,— Nay, if some magic in the air should bring The nightingales to sing Her requiem who rests beneath the earth In this grim graveyard city of her birth, Deem not but birds are these, But simple songsters of the woods and leas. These are no common choristers of air, The singing sprites of heaven's lowest stair, That hymn the Spring and Summer everywhere; They are the tuneful creatures of my soul, My thoughts of joy and dole, Which, did she live, were music wild and free, Pageant and jubilee, Such as had overflooded land and sea With tides of song, but, she being dead, I gave To glorify her grave.</field>
