      <field name="fulltext">PART ONE POEMS FROM THE DOBELL FOLIO MS. The Salutation. 1 These little Limmes, These Eys and Hands which here I find, These rosie Cheeks wherwith my Life begins, Where have ye been? Behind What Curtain were ye from me hid so long! Where was? in what Abyss, my Speaking Tongue? 2 When silent I, So many thousand thousand yeers, Beneath the Dust did in a Chaos lie, How could I Smiles or Tears, Or Lips or Hands or Eys or Ears perceiv? Welcom ye Treasures which I now receiv. 3 I that so long Was Nothing from Eternitie, Did little think such Joys as Ear or Tongue, To Celebrat or See: Such Sounds to hear, such Hands to feel, such Feet, Beneath the Skies, on such a Ground to meet. 4 New Burnisht Joys! Which yellow Gold and Pearl excell! Such Sacred Treasures are the Lims in Boys, In which a Soul doth Dwell; Their Organized Joynts, and Azure Veins More Wealth include, then all the World contains. 5 From Dust I rise, And out of Nothing now awake, These Brighter Regions which salute mine Eys, A Gift from GOD I take. The Earth, the Seas, the Light, the Day, the Skies, The Sun and Stars are mine; if those I prize. 6 Long time before I in my Mother's Womb was born, A GOD preparing did this Glorious Store, The World for me adorne. Into this Eden so Divine and fair, So Wide and Bright, I com his Son and Heir. 7 A Stranger here Strange Things doth meet, Strange Glories See; Strange Treasures lodg'd in this fair World appear, Strange all, and New to me. But that they mine should be, who nothing was, That Strangest is of all, yet brought to pass. Wonder. 1 How like an Angel came I down! How Bright are all Things here! When first among his Works I did appear O how their GLORY me did Crown? The World resembled his Eternitie, In which my Soul did Walk; And evry Thing that I did see, Did with me talk. 2 The Skies in their Magnificence, The Lively, Lovely Air; Oh how Divine, how Soft, how Sweet, how fair! The Stars did entertain my Sence, And all the Works of GOD so Bright and pure, So Rich and Great did seem, As if they ever must endure, In my Esteem. 3 A Native Health and Innocence Within my Bones did grow, And while my GOD did all his Glories shew, I felt a Vigour in my Sence That was all SPIRIT. I within did flow With Seas of Life, like Wine; I nothing in the World did know, But 'twas Divine. 4 Harsh ragged Objects were conceald, Oppressions Tears and Cries, Sins, Griefs, Complaints, Dissentions, Weeping Eys, Were hid: and only Things reveald, Which Heav'nly Spirits, and the Angels prize. The State of Innocence And Bliss, not Trades and Poverties, Did fill my Sence. 5 The Streets were pavd with Golden Stones, The Boys and Girles were mine, Oh how did all their Lovly faces shine! The Sons of Men were Holy Ones. In Joy, and Beauty, then appear'd to me, And evry Thing which here I found, While like an Angel I did See, Adornd the Ground. 6 Rich Diamond and Pearl and Gold In evry Place was seen; Rare Splendors, Yellow, Blew, Red, White and Green, Mine Eys did evry where behold. Great Wonders clothd with Glory did appear, Amazement was my Bliss. That and my Wealth was evry where: No Joy to this! 7 Cursd and Devisd Proprieties, With Envy, Avarice And Fraud, those Feinds that Spoyl even Paradice, Fled from the Splendor of mine Eys. And so did Hedges, Ditches, Limits, Bounds, I dreamd not ought of those, But wanderd over all mens Grounds, And found Repose. 8 Properties themselvs were mine, And Hedges Ornaments; Walls, Boxes, Coffers, and their rich Contents Did not Divide my Joys, but all combine. Clothes, Ribbans, Jewels, Laces, I esteemd My Joys by others worn; For me they all to wear them seemd When I was born. Eden. 1 A learned and a Happy Ignorance Divided me, From all the Vanitie, From all the Sloth Care Pain and Sorrow that advance, The Madness and the Miserie Of Men. No Error, no Distraction I Saw soil the Earth, or overcloud the Skie. 2 I knew not that there was a Serpents Sting, Whose Poyson shed On Men, did overspread The World: not did I Dream of such a Thing As Sin; in which Mankind lay Dead. They all were Brisk and Living Weights to me, Yea Pure, and full of Immortalitie. 3 Joy, Pleasure, Beauty, Kindness, Glory, Lov, Sleep, Day, Life, Light, Peace, Melody, my Sight, My Ears and Heart did fill, and freely mov. All that I saw did me Delight. The Universe was then a World of Treasure, To me an Universal World of Pleasure. 4 Unwelcom Penitence was then unknown Vain Costly Toys, Swearing and Roaring Boys, Shops, Markets, Taverns, Coaches were unshewn; So all things were that Drownd my Joys. No Thorns choakt up my Path, nor hid the face Of Bliss and Beauty, nor Ecclypst the place. 5 Only what Adam in his first Estate, Did I behold; Hard Silver and Drie Gold As yet lay under Ground; my Blessed Fate Was more acquainted with the Old And Innocent Delights, which he did see In his Original Simplicitie. 6 Those Things which first his Eden did adorn, My Infancy Did crown. Simplicitie Was my Protection when I first was born. Mine Eys those Treasures first did see, Which God first made. The first Effects of Lov My first Enjoyments upon Earth did prov; 7 And were so Great, and so Divine, so Pure; So fair and Sweet, So True; when I did meet Them here at first, they did my Soul allure, And drew away my Infant feet Quite from the Works of Men; that I might see The Glorious Wonders of the DEITIE. Innocence. 1 But that which most I Wonder at, which most I did esteem my Bliss, which most I Boast, And ever shall Enjoy, is that within I felt no Stain, nor Spot of Sin. No Darkness then did overshade, But all within was Pure and Bright, No Guilt did Crush, nor fear invade But all my Soul was full of Light. A Joyfull Sence and Puritie Is all I can remember. The very Night to me was Bright, Twas Summer in December. 2 A Serious Meditation did employ My Soul within, which taken up with Joy Did seem no Outward thing to note, but flie All Objects that do feed the Eye. While it those very Objects did Admire, and prize, and prais, and love, Which in their Glory most are hid, Which Presence only doth remove. Their Constant Daily Presence I Rejoycing at, did see; And that which takes them from the Ey Of others, offerd them to me. 3 No inward Inclination did I feel To Avarice or Pride: My Soul did kneel In Admiration all the Day. No Lust, nor Strife, Polluted then my Infant Life. No Fraud nor Anger in me movd No Malice Jealousie or Spite; All that I saw I truly lovd. Contentment only and Delight Were in my Soul. O Heav'n! what Bliss Did I enjoy and feel! What Powerfull Delight did this Inspire! for this I daily Kneel. 4 Whether it be that Nature is so pure, And Custom only vicious; or that sure God did by Miracle the Guilt remov, And make my Soul to feel his Lov, So Early: Or that 'twas one Day, Wher in this Happiness I found; Whose Strength and Brightness so do Ray, That still it seems me to Surround. What ere it is, it is a Light So Endless unto me That I a World of true Delight Did then and to this Day do see. 5 That Prospect was the Gate of Heav'n, that Day The ancient Light of Eden did convey Into my Soul: I was an Adam there, A little Adam in a Sphere Of Joys! O there my Ravisht Sence Was entertaind in Paradice, And had a Sight of Innocence. Which was beyond all Bound and Price. An Antepast of Heaven sure! I on the Earth did reign. Within, without me, all was pure. I must becom a Child again. The Preparative. 1 My Body being Dead, my Lims unknown; Before I skild to prize Those living Stars mine Eys, Before my Tongue or Cheeks were to me shewn, Before I knew my Hands were mine, Or that my Sinews did my Members joyn, When neither Nostril, Foot, nor Ear, As yet was seen, or felt, or did appear; I was within A House I knew not, newly clothd with Skin. 2 Then was my Soul my only All to me, A Living Endless Ey, Just bounded with the Skie Whose Power, whose Act, whose Essence was to see. I was an Inward Sphere of Light, Or an Interminable Orb of Sight, An Endless and a Living Day, A vital Sun that round about did ray All Life, all Sence, A Naked Simple Pure Intelligence. 3 I then no Thirst nor Hunger did perceiv, No dull Necessity, No Want was Known to me; Without Disturbance then I did receiv The fair Ideas of all Things, And had the Hony even without the Stings. A Meditating Inward Ey Gazing at Quiet did within me lie, And evry Thing Delighted me that was their Heavnly King. 4 For Sight inherits Beauty, Hearing Sounds, The Nostril Sweet Perfumes, All Tastes have hidden Rooms Within the Tongue; and Feeling Feeling Wounds With Pleasure and Delight: but I Forgot the rest, and was all Sight, or Ey. Unbodied and Devoid of Care, Just as in Heavn the Holy Angels are. For Simple Sence Is Lord of all Created Excellence. 5 Being thus prepard for all Felicity, Not prepossest with Dross, Nor stifly glued to gross And dull Materials that might ruine me, Not fetterd by an Iron Fate With vain Affections in my Earthy State To any thing that might Seduce My Sence, or els bereave it of its use I was as free As if there were nor Sin, nor Miserie. 6 Pure Empty Powers that did nothing loath, Did like the fairest Glass, Or Spotless polisht Brass, Themselvs soon in their Objects Image cloath. Divine Impressions when they came, Did quickly enter and my Soul inflame. Tis not the Object, but the Light That maketh Heaven; Tis a Purer Sight. Felicitie Appears to none but them that purely see. 7 A Disentangled and a Naked Sence A Mind that's unpossest, A Disengaged Brest, An Empty and a Quick Intelligence Acquainted with the Golden Mean, An Even Spirit Pure and Serene, Is that where Beauty, Excellence, And Pleasure keep their Court of Residence. My Soul retire, Get free, and so thou shalt even all Admire. The Instruction. 1 Spue out thy filth, thy flesh abjure; Let not Contingents thee defile. For Transients only are impure, And Aery things thy soul beguil. 2 Unfelt, unseen let those things be Which to thy Spirit were unknown, When to thy Blessed Infancy The World, thy Self, thy God was shewn. 3 All that is Great and Stable stood Before thy Purer Eys at first: All that in Visibles is Good Or pure, or fair, or unaccurst. 4 Whatever els thou now dost see In Custom, Action, or Desire, Tis but a Part of Miserie In which all Men at once conspire. The Vision. 1 Flight is but the Preparative: The Sight Is Deep and Infinit; Ah me! tis all the Glory, Love, Light, Space, Joy Beauty and Varietie That doth adorn the Godheads Dwelling Place Tis all that Ey can see. Even Trades them selvs seen in Celestial Light, And Cares and Sins and Woes are Bright. 2 Order the Beauty even of Beauty is, It is the Rule of Bliss, The very Life and Form and Caus of Pleasure; Which if we do not understand, Ten thousand Heaps of vain confused Treasure Will but oppress the Land. In Blessedness it self we that shall miss Being Blind which is the Caus of Bliss. 3 First then behold the World as thine, and well Note that where thou dost Dwell. See all the Beauty of the Spacious Case, Lift up thy pleasd and ravisht Eys, Admire the Glory of the Heavnly place, And all its Blessings prize. That Sight well seen thy Spirit shall prepare, The first makes all the other Rare. 4 Mens Woes shall be but foyls unto thy Bliss, Thou once Enjoying this: Trades shall adorn and Beautify the Earth, Their Ignorance shall make thee Bright, Were not their Griefs Democritus his Mirth? Their Faults shall keep thee right. All shall be thine, becaus they all Conspire, To feed and make they Glory higher. 5 To see a Glorious Fountain and an End To see all Creatures tend To thy Advancement, and so sweetly close In thy Repose: To see them shine In Use in Worth in Service, and even Foes Among the rest made thine. To see all these unite at once in Thee Is to behold Felicitie. 6 To see the Fountain is a Blessed Thing. It is to see the King Of Glory face to face: But yet the End, The Glorious Wondrous End is more; And yet the fountain there we Comprehend, The Spring we there adore. For in the End the Fountain best is Shewn, As by Effects the Caus is Known. 7 From One, to One, in one to see All Things To see the King of Kings But once in two; to see his Endless Treasures Made all mine own, my self the End Of all his Labors! Tis the Life of Pleasures! To see my self His friend! Who all things finds conjoynd in Him alone, Sees and Enjoys the Holy one. The Rapture. 1 Sweet Infancy! O fire of Heaven! O Sacred Light! How Fair and Bright! How Great am I, Whom all the World doth magnifie! 2 O Heavenly Joy! O Great and Sacred Blessedness, Which I possess! So great a Joy Who did into my Armes convey! 3 From GOD abov Being sent, the Heavens me enflame, To prais his Name. The Stars do move! The Burning Sun doth shew his Love. 4 O how Divine Am I! To all this Sacred Wealth, This Life and Health, Who raisd? Who mine Did make the same? What Hand Divine The Improvment. 1 Tis more to recollect, then make. The one Is but an Accident without the other. We cannot think the World to be the Throne, Of God, unless his Wisdom shine as Brother Unto his Power, in the Fabrick, so That we the one may in the other know. 2 His Goodness also must in both appear, And all the Children of his Lov be found, In the Creation of the Starry Sphere, And in the Forming of the fruitfull Ground; Before we can that Happiness descrie, Which is the Daughter of the DEITIE. 3 His Wisdom Shines in Spreading forth the Skie, His Power's Great in Ordering the Sun, His Goodness very Marvellous and High Appears, in evry Work his Hand hath done. And all his Works in their varietie, United or asunder pleas the Eye. 4 But neither Goodness, Wisdom, Power, nor Love, Nor Happiness it self in things could be, Did not they all in one fair Order move, And joyntly by their Service End in me. Had he not made an Ey to be the Sphere Of all Things, none of these would e're appear. 5 His Wisdom, Goodness, Power, as they unite All things in one, that they may be the Treasures Of one Enjoy'r, shine in the utmost Height They can attain; and are most Glorious Pleasures, When all the Univers conjoynd in one, Exalts a Creature, as if that alone. 6 To bring the Moisture of far distant Seas Into a point, to make them present here, In virtu, not in Bulk; one man to pleas With all the Powers of the Highest Sphere, From East, from West, from North and South, to bring The pleasing Influence of evry thing; 7 Is far more Great then to Creat them there Where now they stand; His Wisdom more doth shine In that, his Might and Goodness more appear, In recollecting; He is more Divine In making evry Thing a Gift to one Then in the sev'ral Parts of all his Wide Throne. 8 Herein we see a Marvellous Designe, And apprehending Clearly the Great Skill Of that Great Architect, whose Lov doth shine In all his Works, we find his Life and Will. For lively Counsels do the Godhead shew, And these his Lov and Goodness make us know. 9 By Wise Contrivance he doth all things guid, And so dispose them, that while they unite, For Man he Endless Pleasures doth Provide, And shews that Happiness is his Delight, His Creatures Happiness as well as His: For that in Truth he seeks, and tis his Bliss. 10 O Rapture! Wonder! Extasie! Delight! How Great must then his Glory be, how Great Our Blessedness! How vast and Infinit Our Pleasure, how Transcendent, how compleat, If we the Goodness of our God possess, And all His Joy be in our Blessedness! 11 Almighty Power when it is employd For one, that he with Glory might be Crownd; Eternal Wisdom when it is Enjoyd By one, whom all its Pleasures do surround, Produce a Creature, that must, all his Days, Return the Sacrifice of Endless Prais. 12 But Oh! the vigor of mine Infant Sence Drives me too far: I had not yet the Eye The Apprehension, or Intelligence Of Things so very Great Divine and High. But all things were Eternal unto me, And mine, and Pleasing which mine Ey did see. 13 That was enough at first: Eternitie, Infinity, and Lov were Silent Joys; Power, Wisdom, Goodness and Felicitie; All these which now our Care and Sin destroys, By Instinct virtualy were well discernd, And by their Representatives were learnd. 14 As Spunges gather Moisture from the Earth Wheron there is scarce any Sign of Dew; As Air infecteth Salt; so at my Birth All these were unperceivd, yet near and tru: Not by Reflexion, and Distinctly known, But, by their Efficacy, all mine own. The Approach. 1 That Childish Thoughts such Joys inspire, Doth make my Wonder and his Glory Higher; His Bounty, and my Wealth more Great, It shews his Kingdom and his Work Compleat: In which there is not any Thing Not meet to be the Joy of Cherubim. 2 He in our Childhood with us walks, And with our Thoughts Mysteriously he talks; He often visiteth our Minds, But cold Acceptance in us ever finds: We send him often grievd away; Els would he shew us all his Kingdoms Joy. 3 O Lord I wonder at thy Love, Which did my Infancy so Early move: But more at that which did forbear, And move so long, tho Sleighted many a yeer: But most of all, at last that Thou Thyself shouldst me convert I scarce know how. 4 Thy Gracious Motions oft in vain Assaulted me: My Heart did Hard remain Long time: I sent my God away, Grievd much that he could not impart his Joy. I careless was, nor did regard The End for which he all these Thoughts prepard. 5 But now with New and Open Eys, I see beneath as if above the Skies; And as I Backward look again, See all his Thoughts and mine most Clear and Plain. He did Approach, he me did Woo I wonder that my God this thing would doe. 6 From Nothing taken first I was, What Wondrous Things his Glory brought to pass! Now in this World I him behold, And me enveloped in more then Gold; In deep Abysses of Delights, In present Hidden Precious Benefits. 7 Those Thoughts his Goodness long before Prepard as Precious and Celestial Store, With curious Art in me inlaid, That Childhood might it self alone be said, My Tutor, Teacher, Guid to be, Instructed then even by the Deitie. Dumnesse. Sure Man was born to Meditat on Things, And to Contemplat the Eternal Springs Of God and Nature, Glory, Bliss and Pleasure; That Life and Love might be his Heavnly Treasure: And therfore Speechless made at first, that he Might in himself profoundly Busied be: And not vent out, before he hath t'ane in Those Antidots that guard his Soul from Sin. Wise Nature made him Deaf too, that he might Not be disturbd, while he doth take Delight In inward Things, nor be depravd with Tongues, Nor Injurd by the Errors and the Wrongs That Mortal Words convey. For Sin and Death Are most infused by accursed Breath, That flowing from Corrupted Intrails, bear Those hidden Plagues which Souls may justly fear. This, my Dear friends, this was my Blessed Case; For nothing spoke to me but the fair Face Of Heav'n and Earth, before my self could speak, I then my Bliss did, when my Silence, break. My Non-Intelligence of Human Words Ten thousand Pleasures unto me affords; For while I knew not what they to me said, Before their Souls were into mine conveyd, Before that Living Vehicle of Wind Could breath into me their infected Mind Before my Thoughts were levend with theirs, before There any Mixture was; the Holy Door, Or Gate of Souls was closd, and mine being One With in it self to me alone was Known. Then did I dwell within a World of Light, Distinct and Seperat from all Mens Sight, Where I did feel strange Thoughts, and such Things see That were, or seemd, only reveald to Me, There I saw all the World Enjoyd by one; There I was in the World my Self alone; No Business Serious seemd but one; No Work But one was found; and that did in me lurk. D'ye ask me What? It was with Cleerer Eys To see, all Creatures full of Deities; Especialy Ones self: And to Admire The Satisfaction of all True Desire: Twas to be Pleasd with all that God hath done; Twas to Enjoy even All beneath the Sun: Twas with a Steddy and immediat Sence To feel and measure all the Excellence Of Things: Twas to inherit Endless Treasure, And to be fild with Everlasting Pleasure: To reign in Silence, and to Sing alone To see, love, Covet, hav, Enjoy and Prais, in one: To Prize and to be ravishd: to be true, Sincere and Single in a Blessed View To prize and prais. Thus was I pent within A Fort, Impregnable to any Sin: Till the Avenues being Open laid, Whole Legions Enterd, and the Forts Betrayd. Before which time a Pulpit in my Mind, A Temple, and a Teacher I did find, With a large Text to comment on. No Ear, But Eys them selvs were all the Hearers there. And evry Stone, and Evry Star a Tongue, And evry Gale of Wind a Curious Song. The Heavens were an Orakle, and spake Divinity: The Earth did undertake The office of a Priest; And I being Dum (Nothing besides was dum;) All things did com With Voices and Instructions; but when I Had gaind a Tongue, their Power began to die. Mine Ears let other Noises in, not theirs; A Nois Disturbing all my Songs and Prayers. My foes puld down the Temple to the Ground, They my Adoring Soul did deeply Wound, And casting that into a Swoon, destroyd The Oracle, and all I there enjoyd. And having once inspird me with a Sence Of forrein Vanities, they march out thence In Troops that Cover and despoyl my Coasts, Being the Invisible, most Hurtfull Hosts. Yet the first Words mine Infancy did hear, The Things which in my Dumness did appear, Preventing all the rest, got such a root Within my Heart, and stick so close unto't It may be Trampld on, but still will grow; And Nutriment to Soyl it self will owe. The first Impressions are Immortal all. And let mine Enemies hoop, Cry, roar, or Call, Yet these will whisper if I will but hear, And penetrat the Heart, if not the Ear. Silence. A quiet Silent Person may possess All that is Great or High in Blessedness. The Inward Work is the Supreme: for all The other were occasiond by the Fall. A man, that seemeth Idle to the view Of others, may the Greatest Business do. Those Acts which Adam in his Innocence Performed, carry all the Excellence. These outward Busy Acts he knew not, were But meaner Matters, of a lower Sphere. Building of Churches, giving to the Poor, In Dust and Ashes lying on the floor, Administring of Justice, Preaching Peace, Ploughing and Toyling for a forc't Increas, With Visiting the Sick, or Governing The rude and Ignorant: This was a thing As then unknown. For neither Ignorance Nor Poverty, nor Sickness did advance Their Banner in the World, till Sin came in: These therfore were occasiond all by Sin. The first and only Work he had to do, Was in himself to feel his Bliss, to view His Sacred Treasures, to admire, rejoyce Sing Praises with a Sweet and Heavnly voice, See, Prize, Give hearty Thanks within, and Love Which is the High and only Work, above Them all. And this at first was mine; These were My Exercises of the Highest Sphere. To see, Approve, take Pleasure, and rejoyce, Within, is better than an Empty Voice: No Melody in Words can Equal that; The Sweetest Organ, Lute, or Harp is flat, And Dull, compard thereto. And O that Still I might Admire my Fathers Lov and Skill! This is to Honor, Worship and Adore, This is to fear Him: nay it is far more. It is to Enjoy Him, and to Imitate The Life and Glory of his High Estate. Tis to receiv with Holy Reverence, To understand his Gifts, and with a Sence Of Pure Devotion, and Humilitie, To prize his Works, his Lov to Magnify. O happy Ignorance of other Things, Which made me present with the King of kings! And like Him too! All Spirit, Life and Power, All Lov and Joy, in his Eternal Bower. A World of Innocence as then was mine, In which the Joys of Paradice did shine And while I was not here I was in Heaven, Not resting one, but evry Day in Seven. Forever Minding with a lively Sence, The Univers in all its Excellence. No other Thoughts did intervene, to Cloy, Divert, extinguish, or Ecclyps my Joy. No other Customs, New-found Wants, or Dreams Invented here polluted my pure Streams. No Aloes or Dregs, no Wormwood Star Was seen to fall into the Sea from far. No rotten Soul, did like an Apple, near My Soul approach. There's no Contagion here. An unperceived Donor gave all Pleasures, There nothing was but I, and all my Treasures. In that fair World one only was the Friend, One Golden Stream, one Spring, one only End. There only one did Sacrifice and Sing To only one Eternal Heavenly King. The Union was so Strait between them two, That all was eithers which my Soul could view. His Gifts, and my Possessions, both our Treasures; He mine, and I the Ocean of his Pleasures. He was an Ocean of Delights from Whom The Living Springs and Golden Streams did com: My Bosom was an Ocean into which They all did run. And me they did enrich. A vast and Infinit Capacitie, Did make my Bosom like the Deitie, In Whose Mysterious and Celestial Mind All Ages and all Worlds together Shind. Who tho he nothing said did always reign, And in Himself Eternitie contain. The World was more in me, then I in it. The King of Glory in my Soul did sit. And to Himself in me he always gave, All that he takes Delight to see me have. For so my Spirit was an Endless Sphere, Like God himself, and Heaven and Earth was there. My Spirit. 1 My Naked Simple Life was I. That Act so Strongly Shind Upon the Earth, the Sea, the Skie, It was the Substance of My Mind. The Sence it self was I. I felt no Dross nor Matter in my Soul, No Brims nor Borders, such as in a Bowl We see, My Essence was Capacitie. That felt all Things, The Thought that Springs Therfrom's it self. It hath no other Wings To Spread abroad, nor Eys to see, Nor Hands Distinct to feel, Nor Knees to Kneel: But being Simple like the Deitie In its own Centre is a Sphere Not shut up here, but evry Where. 2 It Acts not from a Centre to Its Object as remote, But present is, when it doth view, Being with the Being it doth note. Whatever it doth do, It doth not by another Engine work, But by it self; which in the Act doth lurk. Its Essence is Transformd into a true And perfect Act. And so Exact Hath God appeard in this Mysterious Fact, That tis all Ey, all Act, all Sight, And what it pleas can be, Not only see, Or do; for tis more Voluble then Light: Which can put on ten thousand Forms, Being clothd with what it self adorns. 3 This made me present evermore With whatsoere I saw. An Object, if it were before My Ey, was by Dame Natures Law, Within my Soul. Her Store Was all at once within me; all her Treasures Were my Immediat and Internal Pleasures, Substantial Joys, which did inform my Mind. With all she wrought, My Soul was fraught, And evry Object in my Heart a Thought Begot, or was; I could not tell, Whether the Things did there Themselvs appear, Which in my Spirit truly seemd to dwell; Or whether my conforming Mind Were not even all that therin shind. 4 But yet of this I was most sure, That at the utmost Length, (So Worthy was it to endure) My Soul could best Express its Strength. It was so Quick and Pure, That all my Mind was wholy Evry where What ere it saw, twas ever wholy there; The Sun ten thousand Legions off, was nigh: The utmost Star, Tho seen from far, Was present in the Apple of my Eye. There was my Sight, my Life, my Sence, My Substance and my Mind My Spirit Shind Even there, not by a Transeunt Influence. The Act was Immanent, yet there. The Thing remote, yet felt even here. 5 O Joy! O Wonder, and Delight! O Sacred Mysterie! My Soul a Spirit infinit! An Image of the Deitie! A pure Substantiall Light! That Being Greatest which doth Nothing seem! Why twas my All, I nothing did esteem But that alone. A Strange Mysterious Sphere! A Deep Abyss That sees and is The only Proper Place of Heavenly Bliss. To its Creator tis so near In Lov and Excellence In Life and Sence, In Greatness Worth and Nature; And so Dear; In it, without Hyperbole, The Son and friend of God we see. 6 A Strange Extended Orb of Joy, Proceeding from within, Which did on evry side convey It self, and being nigh of Kin To God did evry Way Dilate it self even in an Instant, and Like an Indivisible Centre Stand At once Surrounding all Eternitie. Twas not a Sphere Yet did appear One infinit. Twas somwhat evry where. And tho it had a Power to see Far more, yet still it shind And was a Mind Exerted for it saw Infinitie Twas not a Sphere, but twas a Might Invisible, and gave Light. 7 O Wondrous Self! O Sphere of Light, O Sphere of Joy most fair; O Act, O Power infinit; O Subtile, and unbounded Air! O Living Orb of Sight! Thou which within me art, yet Me! Thou Ey, And Temple of his Whole Infinitie! O what a World art Thou! a World within! All Things appear, All Objects are Alive in thee! Supersubstancial, Rare, Abov them selvs, and nigh of Kin To those pure Things we find In his Great Mind Who made the World! thou now Ecclypsd by Sin. There they are Usefull and Divine, Exalted there they ought to Shine. The Apprehension. If this I did not evry moment see, And if my Thoughts did stray At any time, or idly play, And fix on other Objects, yet This Apprehension set In me Was all my whole felicitie. Fullnesse. That Light, that Sight, that Thought, Which in my Soul at first He wrought, Is sure the only Act to which I may Assent to Day: The Mirror of an Endless Life, The Shadow of a Virgin Wife, A Spiritual World Standing within, An Univers enclosd in Skin. My Power exerted, or my Perfect Being, If not Enjoying, yet an Act of Seeing. My Bliss Consists in this, My Duty too In this I view. It is a Fountain or a Spring, Refreshing me in evry thing. From whence those living Streams I do derive By which my Thirsty Soul is kept alive. The Centre and the Sphere Of my Delights are here. It is my Davids Tower, Where all my Armor lies, The Fountain of my Power, My Bliss, my Sacrifice: A little Spark, That shining in the Dark, Makes, and encourages my Soul to rise. The Root of Hope, the Golden Chain, Whose End is, as the Poets feign, Fastned to the very Throne Of Jove. It is a Stone, On which I sit, An Endless Benefit, That being made my Regal Throne, Doth prove An Oracle of his Eternal Love. Nature. That Custom is a Second Nature, we Most Plainly find by Natures Purity. For Nature teacheth Nothing but the Truth. I'me Sure mine did in my Virgin Youth. The very Day my Spirit did inspire, The Worlds fair Beauty set my Soul on fire. My Senses were Informers to my Heart, The Conduits of his Glory Power and Art. His Greatness Wisdom Goodness I did see, His Glorious Lov, and his Eternitie, Almost as soon as Born: and evry Sence Was in me like to som Intelligence. I was by Nature prone and apt to love All Light and Beauty, both in Heaven above, And Earth beneath, prone even to Admire, Adore and Prais as well as to Desire. My Inclinations raisd me up on high, And guided me to all Infinitie. A Secret self I had enclosd within, That was not bounded with my Clothes or Skin, Or terminated with my Sight, the Sphere Of which was bounded with the Heavens here: But that did rather, like the Subtile Light, Securd from rough and raging Storms by Night, Break through the Lanthorns sides, and freely ray Dispersing and Dilating evry Way: Whose Steddy Beams too Subtile for the Wind, Are such, that we their Bounds can scarcely find. It did encompass, and possess rare Things, But yet felt more, and on its Angels Wings Pierc'd through the Skies immediatly, and Sought For all that could beyond all Worlds be thought. It did not move, nor one way go, but stood, And by Dilating of it self, all Good It strove to see, as if twere present there, Even while it present stood conversing here: And more suggested then I could discern, Or ever since by any Means could learn. Vast unaffected Wonderfull Desires, Like Inward, Nativ, uncausd, hidden fires, Sprang up with Expectations very strange, Which into New Desires did quickly change. For all I saw beyond the Azure Round, Was Endless Darkness with no Beauty crownd. Why Beauty should not there, as well as here, Why Goodness should not likewise there appear, Why Treasures and Delights should bounded be, Since there is such a Wide Infinitie; These were the Doubts and Troubles of my Soul, By which I do perceiv without Controll, A World of Endless Joys by Nature made, That needs must flourish ever, never fade. A Wide Magnificent and Spacious Skie, So rich tis Worthy of the Deitie, Clouds here and there like Winged Charets flying, Flowers ever flourishing, yet always Dying, A Day of Glory where I all things see, As twere enrichd with Beams of Light for me, And drownd in Glorious Rays of purer Light, Succeeded with a Black, yet Glorious Night, Stars Sweetly Shedding to my pleased Sence, On all things their Nocturnal Influence, With Secret Rooms in Times and Ages more Past and to com enlarging my great Store, These all in Order present unto Me My Happy Eys did in a Moment see With Wonders there-too, to my Soul unknown, Till they by Men and Reading first were shewn. All which were made, that I might ever be With som Great Workman, som Great Deitie. But yet there were new Rooms, and Spaces more, Beyond all these, New Regions ore and ore, Into all which my pent-up-Soul like fire Did break, Surmounting all I here admire. The Spaces fild were like a Cabinet Of Joys before me most Distinctly set: The Empty, like to large and Vacant Room For Fancy to enlarge in, and presume A Space for more, removd, but yet adorning These neer at hand, that pleasd me evry Morning. Here I was seated to behold New Things, In the fair fabrick of the King of Kings. All, all was mine. The fountain tho not Known, Yet that there must be one was plainly shewn. Which fountain of Delights must needs be Lov As all the Goodness of the things did prov. It shines upon me from the highest Skies, And all its Creatures for my sake doth prize, Of whose Enjoyment I am made the End. While how the same is so I comprehend. Ease. 1 How easily doth Nature teach the Soul, How irresistible is her Infusion! There's Nothing found that can her force controll, But Sin. How Weak and feeble's all Delusion! 2 Things fals are forcd, and most Elaborate, Things pure and true are Obvious unto Sence; The first Impressions, in our Earthly State, Are made by Things most Great in Excellence. 3 How easy is it to believ the Skie Is Wide and Great and fair? How soon may we Be made to know the Sun is Bright and High, And very Glorious, when its Beams we see? 4 That all the Earth is one continued Globe, And that all Men theron are Living Treasures, That fields and Meadows are a Glorious Robe, Adorning it with Sweet and Heavenly Pleasures; 5 That all we see is ours, and evry One Possessor of the Whole; that evry Man Is like a God Incarnat on the Throne, Even like the first for whom the World began; 6 Whom all are taught to honor serv and lov, Becaus he is Belovd of God unknown; And therfore is on Earth it self abov All others, that his Wisdom might be shewn: 7 That all may Happy be, Each one most Blest, Both in Himself and others; all most High, While all by each, and each by all possest, Are intermutual Joys, beneath the Skie. 8 This shows a Wise Contrivance, and discovers Som Great Creator Sitting on the Throne, That so disposeth things for all his Lovers, That evry one might reign like GOD alone. Speed. 1 The Liquid Pearl in Springs, The usefull and the Precious Things Are in a Moment Known. Their very Glory does reveal their Worth, (And that doth set their Glory forth;) As soon as I was Born, they all were Shewn. 2 True Living Wealth did flow, In Chrystall Streams below My feet, and trilling down In Pure, Transparent, Soft, Sweet, Melting Pleasures, Like Precious and Diffusive Treasures, At once my Body fed, and Soul did Crown. 3 I was as High and Great, As Kings are in their Seat. All other Things were mine. The World my House, the Creatures were my Goods, Fields, Mountains, Valleys, Woods, Men and their Arts to make me Rich combine. 4 Great, Lofty, Endless, Stable, Various and Innumerable, Bright usefull fair Divine, Immovable and Sweet the Treasures were, The Sacred Objects did appear Most rich and Beautifull, as well as mine. 5 New all! New Burnisht Joys; Tho now by other Toys Ecclypst: New all and mine. Great Truth so Sacred seemd for this to me, Becaus the Things which I did see Were such, my State I knew to be Divine. 6 Nor did the Angels faces, The Glories, and the Graces, The Beauty Peace and Joy Of Heaven it self, more Sweetness yeeld to me. Till filthy Sin did all destroy, These were the Offspring of the Deitie. The Choice. 1 When first Eternity Stoopd down to Nought, And in the Earth its Likeness sought, When first it out of Nothing framd the Skies, And formd the Moon and Sun That we might see what it had don, It was so Wise, That it did prize Things truly Greatest Brightest fairest, Best. All which it made, and left the rest. 2 Then did it take such Care about the Truth, Its Daughter, that even in her Youth, Her face might Shine upon us, and be known, That by a better fate, It other Toys might Antedate, As soon as shewn; And be our own, While we were hers; And that a Virgin Love Her best Inheritance might prove. 3 Thoughts undefiled, Simple, Naked, Pure; Thoughts Worthy ever to endure, Our first and Disengaged thoughts it lovs, And therfore made the Truth, In Infancy and Tender Youth, So Obvious to Our Easy view That it doth prepossess our Soul, and proves The Caus of what it all Ways moves. 4 By Merit and Desire it doth allure; For Truth is so Divine and Pure, So Rich and Acceptable, being seen, (Not parted, but in Whole) That it doth Draw and force the Soul, As the Great Queen Of Bliss, between Whom and the Soul, no one Pretender ought Thrust in, to Captivat a Thought. 5 Hence did Eternity contrive to make The Truth so fair for all our Sake. That being Truth, and Fair and Easy too, While it on all doth Shine, We might by it becom Divine Being led to Woo The Thing we view, And as chast Virgins Early with it joyn, That with it we might likewise Shine. 6 Eternity doth give the richest Things To evry Man, and makes all Kings. The Best and Richest Things it doth convey To all, and evry one. It raised me unto a Throne! Which I enjoy, In such a Way, That Truth her Daughter is my chiefest Bride, Her Daughter Truth's my chiefest Pride. 7 All mine! And seen so Easily! How Great, how Blest! How soon am I of all possest! My Infancie no Sooner Opes its Eys, But Straight the Spacious Earth Abounds with Joy Peace Glory Mirth And being Wise, The very Skies, And Stars do mine becom; being all possest Even in that Way that is the Best. The Person. 1 Ye Sacred Lims, A richer Blazon I will lay On you, then first I found: That like Celestial Kings, Ye might with Ornaments of Joy Be always Crownd. A Deep Vermilion on a Red, On that a Scarlet I will lay, With Gold Ile Crown your Head, Which like the Sun shall Ray. With Robes of Glory and Delight Ile make you Bright. Mistake me not, I do not mean to bring New Robes, but to Display the Thing: Nor Paint, nor Cloath, nor Crown, nor add a Ray, But Glorify by taking all away. 2 The Naked Things Are most Sublime, and Brightest shew, When they alone are seen: Mens Hands then Angels Wings Are truer Wealth even here below: For those but seem. Their Worth they then do best reveal, When we all Metaphores remove, For Metaphores conceal, And only Vapours prove. They best are Blazond when we see The Anatomie, Survey the Skin, cut up the Flesh, the Veins Unfold: The Glory there remains. The Muscles, Fibres, Arteries and Bones Are better far then Crowns and precious Stones. 3 Shall I not then Delight in these most Sacred Treasures Which my Great Father gave, Far more then other Men Delight in Gold? Since these are Pleasures, That make us Brave! Far Braver then the Pearl and Gold That glitter on a Ladies Neck! The Rubies we behold, The Diamonds that Deck The Hands of Queens, compard unto The Hands we view; The Softer Lillies, and the Roses are Less Ornaments to those that Wear The same, then are the Hands, and Lips, and Ey Of those who those fals Ornaments so prize. 4 Let Veritie Be thy Delight: let me Esteem True Wealth far more then Toys: Let Sacred Riches be, While falser Treasures only seem, My real Joys. For Golden Chains and Bracelets are But Gilded Manicles, wherby Old Satan doth ensnare, Allure, Bewitch the Ey. Thy Gifts O God alone Ile prize, My Tongue, my Eys, My cheeks, my Lips, my Ears, my Hands, my Feet; Their Harmony is far more Sweet; Their Beauty true. And these in all my Ways Shall Themes becom, and Organs of thy Praise. The Estate. 1 But shall my Soul no Wealth possess, No Outward Riches have? Shall Hands and Eys alone express Thy Bounty? Which the Grave Shall strait devour. Shall I becom With in my self a Living Tomb Of Useless Wonders? Shall the fair and brave And great Endowments of my Soul lie Waste, Which ought to be a fountain, and a Womb Of Praises unto Thee? Shall there no Outward Objects be, For these to see and Taste? Not so, my God, for Outward Joys and Pleasures Are even the Things for which my Lims are Treasures. 2 My Palate is a Touch-Stone fit To taste how Good Thou art: And other Members second it Thy Praises to impart. There's not an Ey that's framd by Thee, But ought thy Life and Lov, to see. Nor is there, Lord, upon mine Head an Ear, But that the Musick of thy Works should hear. Each Toe, each Finger framed by thy Skill, Ought Oyntments to Distill. Ambrosia, Nectar, Wine should flow From evry Joynt I owe, Or Things more Rich; while they thy Holy Will Are Instruments adapted to fulfill. 3 They ought, my God, to be the Pipes, And Conduits of thy Prais. Mens Bodies were not made for Stripes, Nor any thing but Joys. They were not made to be alone: But made to be the very Throne Of Blessedness, to be like Suns, whose Raies, Dispersed, Scatter many thousand Ways. They Drink in Nectars, and Disburs again In Purer Beams, those Streams, Those Nectars which are causd by Joys. And as the spacious Main Doth all the Rivers which it Drinks, return, Thy Love receivd doth make the Soul to burn. 4 Elixars richer are then Dross, And Ends are more Divine Then are the Means: But Dung and Loss Materials (tho they Shine Like Gold and Silver) are, compard To what thy Spirit doth regard, Thy Will require, thy Lov embrace, thy Mind Esteem, thy Nature most Illustrious find. These are the Things wher with we God reward. Our Love he more doth prize: Our Gratitude is in his Eys, Far richer then the Skies. And those Affections which we do return, And like the Lov which in Himself doth burn. 5 We plough the very Skies, as well As Earth, the Spacious Seas Are ours; the Stars all Gems excell. The Air was made to pleas The Souls of Men: Devouring fire Doth feed and Quicken Mans Desire. The Orb of Light in its wide Circuit movs, Corn for our Food Springs out of very Mire, Our Fences and Fewel grows in Woods and Groves, Choice Herbs and Flowers aspire To Kiss our Feet; Beasts court our Lovs. How Glorious is Mans Fate The Laws of God, the Works he did Create, His Ancient Ways, are His, and my Estate. The Enquirie. 1 Men may delighted be with Springs, While Trees and Herbs their Senses pleas, And taste even living Nectar in the Seas: May think their Members things Of Earthly Worth at least, if not Divine, And Sing becaus the Earth for them doth Shine. 2 But can the Angels take Delight, To see such Faces here beneath? Or can Perfumes indeed from Dunghils breath? Or is the World a Sight Worthy of them? Then may we Mortals be Surrounded with Eternal Claritie. 3 Even Holy Angels may com down To walk on Earth, and see Delights, That feed and pleas, even here, their Appetites. Our Joys may make a Crown For them. And in his Tabernacle Men may be Like Palmes with the Cherubs mingled see. 4 Mens Sences are indeed the Gems, Their Praises the most Sweet Perfumes, Their Eys the Thrones, their Hearts the Heavnly Rooms, Their Souls the Diadems, Their Tongues the Organs which they lov to hear, Their Cheeks and faces like to theirs appear. 5 The Wonders which our God hath done, The Glories of his Attributes, Like dangling Apples or like Golden Fruits, Angelick Joys become. His Wisdom Shines, on Earth; his Lov doth flow, Like Myrrh or Incense, even here below. 6 And shall not we such Joys possess, Which God for Man did chiefly make? The Angels hav them only for our sake! And yet they all confess His Glory here on Earth to be Divine, And that his GODHEAD in his Works doth shine. The Circulation. 1 As fair Ideas from the Skie, Or Images of Things, Unto a Spotless Mirror flie, On unperceived Wings; And lodging there affect the Sence, As if at first they came from thence; While being there, they richly Beautifie The Place they fill, and yet communicat Themselvs, reflecting to the Seers Ey, Just such is our Estate. No Prais can we return again, No Glory in our selvs possess, But what derived from without we gain, From all the Mysteries of Blessedness. 2 No Man breaths out more vital Air, Then he before suckt in. Those Joys and Praises must repair To us, which tis a Sin To bury, in a Senceless Tomb. An Earthly Weight must be the Heir Of all those Joys, the Holy Angels Prize, He must a King, before a Priest becom, And Gifts receiv, or ever Sacrifice. Tis Blindness Makes us Dumb. Had we but those Celestial Eys, Wherby we could behold the Sum Of all his Bounties, we should overflow With Praises, did we but their Causes Know. 3 All Things to Circulations owe Themselvs; by which alone They do exist. They cannot shew A Sigh, a Word, a Groan, A Colour, or a Glimps of Light, The Sparcle of a Precious Stone, A virtue, or a Smell; a lovly Sight, A Fruit, a Beam, an Influence, a Tear; But they anothers Livery must Wear: And borrow Matter first, Before they can communicat. Whatever's empty is accurst: And this doth shew that we must some Estate Possess, or never can communicate. 4 A Spunge drinks in that Water, which Is afterwards exprest. A Liberal hand must first be rich: Who blesseth must be Blest. The Thirsty Earth drinks in the Rain, The Trees suck Moysture at their Roots, Before the one can Lavish Herbs again, Before the other can afford us Fruits. No Tenant can rais Corn, or pay his Rent, Nor can even hav a Lord, That has no Land. No Spring can vent, No vessel any Wine afford Wherin no Liquor's put. No Empty Purs, Can Pounds or Talents of it self disburs. 5 Flame that Ejects its Golden Beams, Sups up the Grosser Air; To Seas, that pour out their Streams In Springs, those Streams repair; Receivd Ideas make even Dreams. No Fancy painteth foule or fair But by the Ministry of Inward Light, That in the Spirits Cherisheth its Sight. The Moon returneth Light, and som men say The very Sun no Ray Nor Influence could hav, did it No forrein Aids, no food admit. The Earth no Exhalations would afford, Were not its Spirits by the Sun restord. 6 All things do first receiv, that giv. Only tis GOD above, That from, and in himself doth live, Whose All sufficient Love Without Original can flow And all the Joys and Glories shew Which Mortal Man can take Delight to know He is the Primitive Eternal Spring The Endless Ocean of each Glorious Thing. The Soul a Vessel is A Spacious Bosom to Contain All the fair Treasures of his Bliss Which run like Rivers from, into the Main, And all it doth receiv returns again. Amendment. 1 That all things should be mine; This makes his Bounty most Divine. But that they all more Rich should be, And far more Brightly shine, As usd by Me: It ravisheth my Soul to see the End, To which this Work so Wonderfull doth tend. 2 That we should make the Skies More Glorious far before thine Eys, Then Thou didst make them, and even Thee Far more thy Works to prize, As usd they be, Then as they're made; is a Stupendious Work, Wherin thy Wisdom Mightily doth lurk. 3 Thy Greatness, and thy Love, Thy Power, in this, my Joy doth move, Thy Goodness and Felicitie, In this Exprest abov All Praise, I see: While thy Great Godhead over all doth reign, And such an End in such a sort attain. 4 What Bound may we Assign O God to any Work of thine! Their Endlessness discovers Thee In all to be Divine; A DEITIE. That wilt for evermore Exceed the End Of all that Creatures Wit can comprehend. 5 Am I a Glorious Spring Of Joys and Riches to my King? Are Men made Gods! And may they see So Wonderfull a Thing As GOD in me! And is my Soul a Mirror that must Shine Even like the Sun, and be far more Divine? 6 Thy Soul, O GOD, doth prize The Seas, the Earth, our Souls, the Skies, As we return the same to Thee; They more delight thine Eys, And Sweeter be, As unto Thee we Offer up the same, Then as to us, from Thee at first they came. 7 O how doth Sacred Lov His Gifts refine, Exalt, Improve! Our Love to Creatures makes them be In thine Esteem above Themselvs to Thee! O here his Goodness evermore admire He made our Souls to make his Creatures Higher. The Demonstration. 1 The Highest Things are Easiest to be shewn, And only capable of being Known. A Miste involvs the Ey, While in the Middle it doth lie; And till the Ends of Things are seen, The Way's uncertain that doth stand between. As in the Air we see the Clouds Like Winding Sheets, or Shrouds; Which tho they nearer are obscure The Sun, which Higher far, is far more Pure. 2 Its very Brightness makes it neer the Ey, Tho many thousand Leagues beyond the Skie. Its Beams by violence Invade, and ravish distant Sence. Only Extremes and Hights are Known; No Certainty, where no Perfection's shewn. Extremities of Blessedness Compell us to confess A GOD indeed. Whose Excellence, In all his Works, must needs exceed all Sence. 3 And for this Caus Incredibles alone May be by Demonstration to us shewn. Those Things that are most Bright Sun-like appear in their own Light. And Nothing's truly seen that's Mean: Be it a Sand, an Acorn, or a Bean, It must be clothd with Endless Glory, Before its perfect Story (Be the Spirit ne're so Clear) Can in its Causes and its Ends appear. 4 What can be more Incredible then this, Where may we find a more profound Abyss? What Heavnly Height can be Transcendent to this Summitie! What more Desirable Object can Be oferd to the Soul of Hungering Man! His Gifts as they to us com down Are infinit, and crown The Soul with Strange Fruitions; yet Returning from us they more value get. 5 And what then this can be more Plain and Clear? What Truth then this more Evident appear! The GODHEAD cannot prize The Sun at all, nor yet the Skies, Or Air, or Earth, or Trees, or Seas, Or Stars, unless the Soul of Man they pleas. He neither sees with Humane Eys Nor needs Himself Seas Skies Or Earth, or any thing: He draws No Breath, nor Eats or Drinks by Natures Laws. 6 The Joy and Pleasure which his Soul doth take In all his Works, is for his Creatures sake. So Great a Certainty We in this Holy Doctrine see That there could be no Worth at all In any Thing Material Great or Small Were not som Creature more Alive, Whence it might Worth Derive. GOD is the Spring whence Things came forth Souls are the fountains of their Real Worth. 7 The Joy and Pleasure which his Soul doth take In all his Works is for his Creatures sake Yet doth he take Delight Thats altogether Infinite In them even as they from him com For such his Lov and Goodness is, the Sum Of all his Happiness doth seem, At least in his Esteem, In that Delight and Joy to lie Which is his Blessed Creatures Melodie. 8 In them he sees, and feels, and Smels, and Lives, In them Affected is to whom he gives: In them ten thousand Ways, He all his Works again enjoys, All things from Him to Him proceed By them; Are His in them: As if indeed His Godhead did it self exceed. To them He all Conveys; Nay even Himself: He is the End To whom in them Himself, and All things tend. The Anticipation. 1 My Contemplation Dazles in the End Of all I comprehend. And soars abov all Heights, Diving into the Depths of all Delights. Can He becom the End, To whom all Creatures tend? Who is the Father of all Infinites! Then may He Benefit receiv from Things, And be not Parent only of all Springs. 2 The End doth Want the Means, and is the Caus, Whose Sake, by Natures Laws, Is that for which they are. Such Sands, such Dangerous Rocks we must beware From all Eternitie A Perfect Deitie Most Great and Blessed he doth still appear. His Essence Perfect was in all its Features He ever Blessed in his Joys and Creatures. 3 From Everlasting he these Joys did Need, And all these Joys proceed From Him Eternaly. From Everlasting His felicitie Compleat and Perfect was: Whose Bosom is the Glass, Wherin we all Things Everlasting See. His Name is NOW, his Nature is forever. None Can his Creatures from their Maker Sever. 4 The End in Him from Everlasting is The Fountain of all Bliss. From Everlasting it Efficient was, and Influence did Emit, That caused all. Before The World, we do Adore This Glorious End. Becaus all Benefit From it proceeds. Both are the very same. The End and Fountain differ but in Name. 5 That so the End should be the very Spring, Of evry Glorious Thing; And that which seemeth Last, The Fountain and the Caus; attaind so fast, That it was first; and movd The Efficient, who so lovd All Worlds and made them for the sake of this It shews the End Compleat before, and is A Perfect Token of his Perfect Bliss. 6 The End Compleat, the Means must needs be so. By which we plainly Know, From all Eternitie, The Means wherby God is, must perfect be. God is Himself the Means, Wherby he doth exist: And as the Sun by Shining's clothd with Beams, So from Himself to All His Glory Streams, Who is a Sun, yet what Himself doth list. 7 His Endless Wants and His Enjoyments be From all Eternitie; Immutable in Him: They are His Joys before the Cherubim. His Wants appreciat all, And being infinit, Permit no Being to be Mean or Small That He enjoys, or is before his Sight. His Satisfactions do His Wants Delight. 8 Wants are the Fountains of Felicitie No Joy could ever be Were there no Want. No Bliss No Sweetness Perfect were it not for this. Want is the Greatest Pleasure Becaus it makes all Treasure. O what a Wonderfull Profound Abyss Is God! In whom Eternal Wants and Treasures Are more Delightfull caus they both are Pleasures. 9 He infinitly wanteth all his Joys; (No Want the Soul ore cloys.) And all those Wanted Pleasures He infinitly Hath. What Endless Measures, What Heights and Depths may we In his Felicitie Conceiv! Whose very Wants are Endles Pleasures. His Life in Wants and Joys is infinit. And both are felt as His Supreme Delight. 10 He's not like us; Possession doth not Cloy, Nor Sence of Want Destroy. Both always are together: No force can either from the other Sever. Yet theres a Space between Thats Endless. Both are seen Distinctly still, and both are seen for ever. As soon as ere he wanteth all his Bliss, His Bliss, tho Everlasting, in Him is. 11 His Essence is all Act: He did, that He All Act might always be. His Nature burns like fire; His Goodness infinitly doth desire, To be by all possest; His Love makes others Blest. It is the Glory of his High Estate, And that which I for ever more Admire, He is an Act that doth Communicate. 12 From all to all Eternity He is That Act: An Act of Bliss: Wherin all Bliss to all, That will receiv the same, or on him call, Is freely given: from Whence Tis Easy even to Sence, To apprehend That all Receivers are In Him, all Gifts, all Joys, all Eys, even all At once, that ever will, or shall appear. 13 He is the Means of them, they not of Him. The Holy Cherubim Souls Angels from him came Who is a Glorious Bright and Living Flame, That on all things doth shine, And makes their Face Divine. And Holy, Holy, Holy, is his Name. He is the Means both of Himself and all, Whom we the Fountain Means and End do call. 14 In whom as in the Fountain all things are, In whom all things appear As in the Means, and End From whom they all proceed, to whom they tend. By whom they are made ours Whose Souls are Spacious Bowers Of all like His. Who ought to have a Sence Of all our Wants, of all His Excellence, That while we all, we Him might comprehend. The Recovery. 1 To see us but receiv, is such a Sight As makes his Treasures infinit! Becaus His Goodness doth possess In us, His own, and our own Blessedness. Yea more, His Love doth take Delight To make our Glory Infinite Our Blessedness to see Is even to the Deitie A Beatifick Vision! He attains His Ends while we enjoy. In us He reigns. 2 For God enjoyd is all his End. Himself he then doth Comprehend. When He is Blessed, Magnified, Extold, Exalted, Praisd and Glorified Honord, Esteemd, Belovd, Enjoyd, Admired, Sanctified, Obeyd, That is receivd. For He Doth place his Whole Felicitie In that, who is despised and defied Undeified almost if once denied. 3 In all his Works, in all his Ways, We must his Glory see and Prais; And since our Pleasure is the End, We must his Goodness and his Lov attend. If we despise his Glorious Works, Such Sin and Mischief in it lurks, That they are all made vain And this is even Endless Pain To him that sees it. Whose Diviner Grief Is here upon (Ah me!) without relief. 4 We pleas his Goodness that receiv: Refusers Him of all bereav. As Bride grooms Know full well that Build A Palace for their Bride. It will not yeeld Any Delight to him at all If She for whom He made the Hall Refuse to dwell in it Or plainly Scorn the Benefit. Her Act that's Wo'ed, yeelds more delight and Pleasure If she receivs, Then all that Pile of Treasure. 5 But we have Hands and Lips and Eys And Hearts and Souls can Sacrifice. And Souls themselvs are made in vain If we our Evil Stubbornness retain. Affections, Praises, are the Things For which he gave us all these Springs, They are the very fruits Of all these Trees and Roots The Fruits and Ends of all his Great Endeavors, Which he abolisheth whoever Severs. 6 Tis not alone a Lively Sence A clear and Quick Intelligence A free, Profound, and full Esteem: Tho these Elixars all and Ends to seem But Gratitude, Thanksgiving, Prais, A Heart returnd for all these Joys, These are the Things admird, These are the Things by Him desird. These are the Nectar and the Quintessence The Cream and Flower that most affect his Sence. 7 The voluntary Act wherby These are repaid, is in his Ey More Precious then the very Skie. All Gold and Silver is but Empty Dross Rubies and Saphires are but Loss The very Sun and Stars and Seas Far less his Spirit pleas. One Voluntary Act of Love Far more Delightfull to his Soul doth prove And is abov all these as far as Love. Another. [He seeks for ours as we do seek for his.] 1 He seeks for ours as we do seek for his. Nay O my Soul, ours is far more His Bliss Then his is ours; at least it so doth seem Both in his own and our Esteem. 2 His Earnest Lov, his Infinit Desires, His Living, Endless, and Devouring fires, Do rage in Thirst, and fervently require A lov, tis Strange it should desire. 3 We cold and Careless are, and scarcely think Upon the Glorious Spring wherat we Drink. Did he not lov us, we could be content. We Wretches are Indifferent! 4 He courts our Lov with infinit Esteem, And seeks it so that it doth almost seem Even all his Blessedness. His Lov doth prize It as the only Sacrifice. 5 Tis Death my Soul to be Indifferent, Set forth thy self unto thy whole Extent, And all the Glory of his Passion prize, Who for Thee livs, who for Thee Dies. 6 His Goodness made thy Lov so Great a Pleasure, His Goodness made thy Soul so Great a Treasure To Thee and Him: that thou mightst both inherit, Prize it according to its Merit. 7 There is no Goodness nor Desert in Thee, For which thy Lov so Coveted should be, His Goodness is the fountain of thy Worth O liv to lov and set it forth. 8 Thou Nothing givst to Him, he gav all Things, To Thee, and made Thee like the King of Kings. His Lov the fountain is of Heaven and Earth The Caus of all thy Joy and Mirth. 9 Thy Lov is Nothing but it self, and yet So infinit is his, that he doth set A valu infinit upon it. Oh! This, canst thou Careless be, and Know! 10 Let that same Goodness, which being infinit, Esteems thy Lov with Infinit Delight, Tho less then His, Tho Nothing, always be An Object Infinit to Thee. 11 And as it is the Caus of all Esteem, Of all the Worth which in thy Lov doth seem, So let it be the Caus of all thy Pleasure Causing its Being and its Measure. Love. 1 O Nectar! O Delicious Stream! O ravishing and only Pleasure! Where Shall such another Theme Inspire my Tongue with Joys, or pleas mine Ear! Abridgement of Delights! And Queen of Sights! O Mine of Rarities! O Kingdom Wide! O more! O Caus of all! O Glorious Bride! O God! O Bride of God! O King! O Soul and Crown of evry Thing! 2 Did not I covet to behold Som Endless Monarch, that did always live In Palaces of Gold Willing all Kingdoms Realms and Crowns to give Unto my Soul! Whose Lov A Spring might prov Of Endless Glories, Honors, friendships, Pleasures, Joys, Praises, Beauties and Celestial Treasures! Lo, now I see there's such a King, The fountain Head of evry Thing! 3 Did my Ambition ever Dream Of such a Lord, of such a Love! Did I Expect so Sweet a Stream As this at any time! Could any Ey Believ it? Why all Power Is used here Joys down from Heaven on my Head to shower And Jove beyond the Fiction doth appear Once more in Golden Rain to come To Danae's Pleasing Fruitfull Womb. 4 His Ganimede! His Life! His Joy! Or he comes down to me, or takes me up That I might be his Boy, And fill, and taste, and give, and Drink the Cup. But these (tho great) are all Too short and small, Too Weak and feeble Pictures to Express The true Mysterious Depths of Blessedness. I am his Image, and his Friend. His Son, Bride, Glory, Temple, End. Thoughts. I. 1 Ye brisk Divine and Living Things, Ye great Exemplars, and ye Heavenly Springs, Which I within me see; Ye Machines Great, Which in my Spirit God did Seat, Ye Engines of Felicitie; Ye Wondrous Fabricks of his Hands, Who all possesseth that he understands; That ye are pent within my Brest, Yet rove at large from East to West, And are Invisible, yet Infinite; Is my Transcendent, and my Best Delight. 2 By you I do the Joys possess Of Yesterdays-yet-present Blessedness; As in a Mirror Clear, Old Objects I Far distant do even now descrie Which by your help are present here. Ye are your selvs the very Pleasures. The Sweetest, last, and most Substantial Treasures. The Offsprings and Effects of Bliss By whose Return my Glory is Renewd, and represented to my View: O ye Delights, most Pure, Divine, and True! 3 Ye Thoughts and Apprehensions are The Heavenly Streams which fill the Soul with rare Transcendent Perfect Pleasures. At any time, As if ye still were in your Prime, Ye Open all his Heavenly Treasures. His Joys accessible are found To you, and those Things enter which Surround The Soul. Ye Living Things within! Where had all Joy and Glory been Had ye not made the Soul those Things to Know. Which Seated in it make the fairest Shew? 4 I know not by what Secret Power Ye flourish so: but ye within your Bower, More Beautifull do seem, And better Meat Ye daily yeeld my Soul to eat, Then even the Objects I esteem Without my Soul. What were the Skie, What were the Sun, or Stars, did ye not lie In me! and represent them there Where els they never could appear! Yea What were Bliss without such Thoughts to me, What were my Life, what were the Deitie? 5 O ye Conceptions of Delight! Ye that inform my Soul with Life and Sight! Ye Representatives, and Springs Of inward Pleasure! Ye Joys! Ye Ends of Outward Treasure! Ye Inward, and ye Living Things! The Thought, or Joy Conceived is The inward Fabrick of my Standing Bliss. It is the Substance of my Mind Transformd, and with its Objects lind. The Quintessence, Elixar, Spirit, Cream. Tis Strange that Things unseen should be Supreme. 6 The Ey's confind, the Body's pent In narrow Room: Lims are of small Extent. But Thoughts are always free. And as they're best, So can they even in the Brest, Rove ore the World with Libertie: Can Enter Ages, Present be In any Kingdom, into Bosoms see. Thoughts, Thoughts can come to Things, and view, What Bodies cant approach unto. They know no Bar, Denial, Limit, Wall: But have a Liberty to look on all. 7 Like Bees they flie from Flower to Flower, Appear in Evry Closet, Temple, Bower; And suck the Sweet from thence, No Ey can see: As Tasters to the Deitie. Incredible's their Excellence. For ever-more they will be seen Nor ever moulder into less Esteem. They ever shew an Equal face, And are Immortal in their place. Ten thousand Ages hence they are as Strong, Ten thousand Ages hence they are as Yong. Blisse. 1 All Blisse Consists in this, To do as Adam did: And not to know those Superficial Toys Which in the Garden once were hid. Those little new Invented Things. Cups, Saddles Crowns are Childish Joys. So Ribbans are and Ring. Which all our Happiness destroys. 2 Nor God In his Abode Nor Saints nor little Boys Nor Angels made them, only foolish Men, Grown mad with Custom on those Toys Which more increas their Wants do dote. And when they Older are do then Those Bables chiefly note With Greedier Eys, more Boys tho Men. Thoughts. II. 1 A Delicate and Tender Thought The Quintessence is found of all he Wrought. It is the fruit of all his Works, Which we conceive, Bring forth, and Give, Yea and in which the Greater Value lurks. It is the fine and Curious Flower, Which we return, and offer evry hour: So Tender in our Paradice That in a Trice It withers strait, and fades away, If we but ceas its Beautie to display. 2 Why Things so Precious, should be made So Prone, so Easy, and so Apt to fade It is not easy to declare. But God would have His Creatures Brave And that too by their own Continual Care. He gave them Power evry Hour, Both to Erect, and to Maintain a Tower, Which he far more in us doth Prize Then all the Skies. That we might offer it to Him, And in our Souls be like the Seraphim. 3 That Temple David did intend, Was but a Thought, and yet it did transcend King Solomons. A Thought we know Is that for which God doth Enrich With Joys even Heaven above, and Earth below. For that all Objects might be seen He made the Orient Azure and the Green: That we might in his Works delight. And that the Sight Of those his Treasures might Enflame The Soul with Love to him, he made the same. 4 This Sight which is the Glorious End Of all his Works, and which doth comprehend Eternity, and Time, and Space, Is far more dear, And far more near To him, then all his Glorious Dwelling Place. It is a Spiritual World within. A Living World, and nearer far of Kin To God, then that which first he made. While that doth fade This therfore ever shall Endure, Within the Soul as more Divine and Pure. [Ye hidden Nectars, which my GOD doth drink] 1 Ye hidden Nectars, which my GOD doth drink, Ye Heavenly Streams, ye Beams Divine, On which the Angels think, How Quick, how Strongly do ye shine! Ye Images of Joy that in me Dwell, Ye Sweet Mysterious Shades That do all Substances Excell, Whose Glory Never fades; Ye Skies, ye Seas, ye Stars, or things more fair, O ever, ever unto me repair. 2 Ye Pleasant Thoughts! O how that Sun Divine Appears to Day which I did see So Sweetly then to Shine. Even in my very Infancy! Ye rich Ideas which within me live Ye Living Pictures here Ye Spirits that do bring and Give All Joys; when ye appear, Even Heavn it self, and God, and all in You, Come down on Earth, and pleas my Blessed View. 3 I never Glorious Great and Rich am found, Am never ravished with Joy, Till ye my Soul Surround, Till ye my Blessedness display. No Soul but Stone, No Man but Clay am I, No flesh, but Dust; till ye Delight, invade to move my Ey, And do replenish me. My Sweet Informers and my Living Treasures My great Companions, and my only Pleasures! 4 O what Incredible Delights, What Fires, What Appetites, what Joys do ye Occasion, what Desires, What Heavenly Praises! While we see What evry Seraphim above admires! Your Jubilee and Trade Ye are so Strangely, and Divinely made, Shall never, never fade. Ye ravish all my Soul, Of you I twice Will speak. For in the Dark y'are Paradice. Thoughts. III. Thoughts are the Angels which we send abroad, To visit all the Parts of Gods Abode. Thoughts are the Things wherin we all confess The Quintessence of Sin and Holiness Is laid. All Wisdom in a Thought doth Shine, By Thoughts alone the Soul is made Divine. Thoughts are the Springs of all our Actions here On Earth, tho they them selvs do not appear. They are the Springs of Beauty, Order, Peace, The Cities Gallantries, the feilds Increas. Rule, Goverment and Kingdoms flow from them, And so doth all the New Jerusalem. At least the Glory, Splendor and Delight, For tis by Thoughts that even she is Bright. Thoughts are the Things wherwith even God is Crownd, And as the Soul without them's useless found, So are all other Creatures too. A Thought Is even the very Cream of all he wrought. All Holy fear, and Love, and Reverence, With Honor, Joy and Prais, as well as Sence, Are hidden in our Thoughts. Thoughts are the Things That us affect: The Hony and the Stings Of all that is, are Seated in a Thought, Even while it seemeth weak, and next to Nought. The Matter of all Pleasure, Virtue, Worth, Grief, Anger, Hate, Revenge, which Words set forth, Are Thoughts alone. Thoughts are the highest Things, The very Offspring of the King of Kings. Thoughts are a kind of Strange Celestial Creature, That when they're Good, they're such in evry Feature, They bear the Image of their father's face, And Beautifie even all his Dwelling Place: So Nimble and Volatile, unconfind, Illimited, to which no Form's assignd, So Changeable, Capacious, Easy, free, That what it self doth pleas a Thought may be. From Nothing to Infinitie it turns, Even in a Moment: Now like fire it burns, Now's frozen Ice: Now shapes the Glorious Sun, Now Darkness in a Moment doth become. Now all at once: Now crowded in a sand, Now fils the Hemisphere, and sees a Land: Now on a Suddain's Wider than the Skie, And now runs Parile with the Deitie. Tis such, that it may all or Nothing be. And's made so Active Voluble and Free Becaus tis Capable of all that's Good, And is the End of all when understood. A Thought can Clothe it self with all the Treasures Of GOD, and be the Greatest of his Pleasures. It all his Laws, and Glorious Works, and Ways, And Attributs, and Counsels; all his Praise It can conceiv, and Imitate, and give: It is the only Being that doth live. Tis Capable of all Perfection here, Of all his Love and Joy and Glory there. It is the only Beauty that doth Shine, Most Great, Transcendent, Heavnly and Divine. The very Best or Worst of Things it is, The Basis of all Misery or Bliss. Its Measures and Capacities are such, Their utmost Measure we can never touch. Here Ornament on Ornament may still Be laid; Beauty on Beauty, Skill on Skill, Strength Still on Strength, and Life it self on Life. Tis Queen of all things, and its Makers Wife. The Best of Thoughts is yet a thing unknown, But when tis Perfect it is like his Own: Intelligible, Endless, yet a Sphere Substantial too: In which all Things appear. All Worlds, all Excellences, Sences, Graces, Joys, Pleasures, Creatures, and the Angels Faces. It shall be Married ever unto all: And all Embrace, tho now it seemeth Small. A Thought my Soul may Omnipresent be. For all it toucheth which a Thought can see. Oh that Mysterious Being! Thoughts are Things, Which rightly used make his Creatures Kings. Desire. 1 For giving me Desire, An Eager Thirst, a burning Ardent fire, A virgin Infant Flame, A Love with which into the World I came, An Inward Hidden Heavenly Love, Which in my Soul did Work and move, And ever ever me Enflame, With restlesse longing Heavenly Avarice, That never could be satisfied, That did incessantly a Paradice Unknown suggest, and som thing undescried Discern, and bear me to it; be Thy Name for ever praisd by me. 2 My Parchd and Witherd Bones Burnt up did seem: My Soul was full of Groans: My Thoughts Extensions were: Like Paces Reaches Steps they did appear: They somwhat hotly did persue, Knew that they had not all their due; Nor ever quiet were: But made my flesh like Hungry Thirsty Ground, My Heart a deep profound Abyss, And evry Joy and Pleasure but a Wound, So long as I my Blessedness did miss. O Happiness! A Famine burns, And all my Life to Angwish turns! 3 Where are the Silent Streams, The Living Waters, and the Glorious Beams, The Sweet Reviving Bowers, The Shady Groves, the Sweet and Curious Flowers, The Springs and Trees, the Heavenly Days, The Flowry Meads, and Glorious Rayes, The Gold and Silver Towers? Alass, all these are poor and Empty Things, Trees Waters Days and Shining Beams Fruits, Flowers, Bowers, Shady Groves and Springs, No Joy will yeeld, no more then Silent Streams. These are but Dead Material Toys, And cannot make my Heavenly Joys. 4 O Love! ye Amities, And Friendships, that appear abov the Skies! Ye Feasts, and Living Pleasures! Ye Senses, Honors, and Imperial Treasures! Ye Bridal Joys! Ye High Delights; That satisfy all Appetites! Ye Sweet Affections, and Ye high Respects! What ever Joys there be In Triumphs, Whatsoever stand In Amicable Sweet Societie Whatever Pleasures are at his right Hand Ye must, before I am Divine, In full Proprietie be mine. 5 This Soaring Sacred Thirst, Ambassador of Bliss, approached first, Making a Place in me, That made me apt to Prize, and Taste, and See, For not the Objects, but the Sence Of Things, doth Bliss to Souls dispence, And make it Lord like Thee. Sence, feeling, Taste, Complacency and Sight, These are the true and real Joys, The Living Flowing Inward Melting, Bright And Heavenly Pleasures; all the rest are Toys: All which are founded in Desire, As Light in Flame, and Heat in fire. Thoughts. IV. In thy Presence there is fulness of Joy, and at thy right hand there are Pleasures for ever more. Thoughts are the Wings on which the Soul doth flie, The Messengers which soar abov the Skie, Elijahs firey Charet, that conveys The Soul, even here, to those Eternal Joys. Thoughts are the privileged Posts that Soar Unto his Throne, and there appear before Our selvs approach. These may at any time Abov the Clouds, abov the Stars may clime. The Soul is present by a Thought; and sees The New Jerusalem, the Palaces, The Thrones and feasts, the Regions of the Skie, The Joys and Treasures of the DEITIE. His Wisdom makes all things so Bright and pure, That they are Worthy ever to endure. His Glorious Works his Laws and Counsels are, When seen, all like himself, beyond compare. All Ages with his Love and Glory Shine, As they are his all Kingdoms are Divine. Whole Hosts of Angels at his Throne attend, And joyfull Praises from his Saints ascend. Thousands of thousands Kneel before his face And all his Benefits with Joy embrace. His Goodness makes all Creatures for his Pleasure, And makes itself his Creatures chiefest Treasure. Almighty Power doth it self employ In all its Works to make it self the Joy Of all his Hosts, and to compleat the Bliss Which Omnipresent and Eternal is. His Omnipresence is an Endless Sphere, Wherin all Worlds as his Delights appear. His Beauty is the Spring of all Delight, Our Blessedness, like his, is infinit. His Glory Endless is and doth Surround And fill all Worlds, without or End or Bound. What hinders then, but we in heav'n may be Even here on Earth did we but rightly see? As Mountains, Charets, Horsemen all on fire, To guard Elisha did of old conspire, Which yet his Servant could not see, being blind, Ourselvs environd with his Joys we find. Eternity it self is that true Light, That doth enclose us being infinite. The very Seas do overflow and Swim With Precious Nectars as they flow from him. The Stable Earth which we beneath behold, Is far more precious then if made of Gold. Fowls Fishes Beasts, Trees Herbs and precious flowers, Seeds Spices Gums and Aromatick Bowers, Wherwith we are enclos'd and servd, each day By his Appointment do their Tributes pay, And offer up themselvs as Gifts of Love, Bestowd on Saints, proceeding from above. Could we but justly, wisely, truly prize These Blessings, we should be above the Skies, And Praises sing with pleasant Heart and Voice, Adoring with the Angels should rejoyce. The fertile Clouds give Rain, the Purer Air, Is Warm and Wholsom, Soft and Bright and fair. The Stars are Wonders which his Wisdom names, The Glorious Sun the Knowing Soul enflames. The very Heavens in their Sacred Worth, At once serv us, and set his Glory forth. Their Influences touch the Gratefull Sence, They pleas the Ey with their Magnificence. While in his Temple all his Saints do sing, And for his Bounty prais their Heavenly King. All these are in his Omnipresence still As Living Waters from his Throne they trill. As Tokens of his Lov they all flow down, Their Beauty Use and Worth the Soul do Crown. Men are like Cherubims on either hand, Whose flaming Love by his Divine Command, Is made a Sacrifice to ours; which Streams Throughout all Worlds, and fills them all with Beams. We drink our fill, and take their Beauty in, While Jesus Blood refines the Soul from Sin. His grievous Cross is a Supreme Delight, And of all Heavenly ones the greatest Sight. His Throne is neer, tis just before our face, And all Eternitie his Dwelling place. His Dwelling place is full of Joys and Pleasures, His Throne a fountain of Eternal Treasures. His Omnipresence is all Sight and Love, Which whoso sees, he ever dwells above. With soft Embraces it doth Clasp the Soul, And Watchfully all Enemies controul. It enters in, and doth a Temple find, Or make a Living one with in the Mind. That while Gods Omnipresence in us lies, His Treasures might be all before our Eys: For Minds and Souls intent upon them here, Do with the Seraphims abov appear: And are like Spheres of Bliss, by Lov and Sight, By Joy, Thanksgiving, Prais, made infinite. O give me Grace to see thy face, and be A constant Mirror of Eternitie. Let my pure Soul, transformed to a Thought, Attend upon thy Throne, and as it ought Spend all its Time in feeding on thy Lov, And never from thy Sacred presence mov. So shall my Conversation ever be In Heaven, and I O Lord my GOD with Thee! Goodnesse. 1 The Bliss of other Men is my Delight: (When once my Principles are right:) And evry Soul which mine doth see A Treasurie. The Face of GOD is Goodness unto all, And while he Thousands to his Throne doth call, While Millions bathe in Pleasures, And do behold his Treasures The Joys of all On mine do fall And even my Infinitie doth seem A Drop without them of a mean Esteem. 2 The Light which on ten thousand faces Shines The Beams which crown ten thousand Vines With Glory and Delight, appear As if they were, Reflected only from them all for me, That I a Greater Beauty there might see. Thus Stars do Beautifie The Azure Canopie Gilded with Rayes Ten thousand Ways They serv me, while the Sun that on them shines Adorns those Stars, and crowns those Bleeding Vines. 3 Where Goodness is within, the Soul doth reign. Goodness the only Sovereign! Goodness delights alone to see Felicitie. And while the Image of his Goodness lives In me, whatever he to any gives Is my Delight and Ends In me in all my Friends For Goodness is The Spring of Bliss And tis the End of all it gives away And all it gives it ever doth enjoy. 4 His Goodness! Lord, it is his Highest Glory! The very Grace of all his Story! What other thing can me delight But the Blest Sight Of his Eternal Goodness? While his Love His Burning Lov the Bliss of all doth prove While it beyond the Ends Of Heaven and Earth extends And Multiplies Above the Skies His Glory Love and Goodness in my Sight, Is for my Pleasure made more infinite. 5 The Soft and Swelling Grapes that on their Vines Receiv the Lively Warmth that Shines Upon them, ripen there for me: Or Drink they be Or Meat. The Stars salute my pleased Sence With a Derivd and borrowed Influence But better Vines do Grow Far Better Wines do flow Above, and while The Sun doth Smile Upon the Lillies there, and all things warme Their pleasant Odors do my Spirit charm. 6 Their rich Affections me like precious Seas Of Nectar and Ambrosia pleas. Their Eys are Stars, or more Divine: And Brighter Shine. Their Lips are soft and Swelling Grapes, their Tongues A Quire of Blessed and Harmonious Songs. Their Bosoms fraught with Love Are Heavens all Heavens above And being Images of GOD, they are The Highest Joys his Goodness did prepare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART TWO POEMS FROM THE BURNEY MS. Burney MS. 392. B.M. The Dedication. To GOD, my Sov'raign Lord, My Heart and Hand accord These Holy First-fruits of a Pious Mind To DEDICATE. At any Rate I can't be so Injurious or Unkind To the Memory of my Brother, As to devote to any Other These Sacred Relicks he hath left behind. My GOD! Thou art the Heir Of all the Prais and Pray'r Which he, or I, can offer at Thy Throne. DIVINITY And POETRY We call Our Gifts: Indeed they are Thine Own: These Faculties from Thee do flow; And therfore, that to Thee we ow Both Them, Our selvs, and All, I needs must own. Thy Prais a Subject is Fitter for Souls in Bliss, Whose more unclouded Sense may best descry Those Depths and Hights, To mortal Wights Unknown, which in Thy Glorious Godhead ly. This well the Author did perceiv, And therfore hastned Flesh to leav, That by the shift, he might becom All Ey. Be pleas'd then to accept This Off'ring I hav kept Too long in Privat; since it may becom A Publick Good, If understood Aright, and Thy good Spirit set it home On Hearts, to propagat Thy Fear, Till, as in Hev'n it is, So here On Earth, Thy Will be don, Thy Kingdom com, Amen. Philip Traheron. The Author to the Critical Peruser. The naked Truth in many faces shewn, Whose inward Beauties very few hav known, A Simple Light, transparent Words, a Strain That lowly creeps, yet maketh Mountains plain, Brings down the highest Mysteries to sense And keeps them there; that is Our Excellence: At that we aim; to th' end thy Soul might see With open Eys thy Great Felicity, Its Objects view, and trace the glorious Way Wherby thou may'st thy Highest Bliss enjoy. No curling Metaphors that gild the Sence, Nor Pictures here, nor painted Eloquence; No florid Streams of Superficial Gems, But real Crowns and Thrones and Diadems! That Gold on Gold should hiding shining ly May well be reckon'd baser Heraldry. An easy Stile drawn from a native vein, A clearer Stream than that which Poets feign, Whose bottom may, how deep so'ere, be seen, Is that which I think fit to win Esteem: Els we could speak Zamzummim words, and tell A Tale in tongues that sound like Babel-Hell; In Meteors speak, in blazing Prodigies, Things that amaze, but will not make us wise. The Præface On Shining Banks we could nigh Tagus walk; In flow'ry Meads of rich Pactolus talk; Bring in the Druids, and the Sybills view; See what the Rites are which the Indians do; Derive along the channel of our Quill The Streams that flow from high Parnassus hill; Ransack all Nature's Rooms, and add the things Which Persian Courts enrich; to make Us Kings: To make us Kings indeed! Not verbal Ones, But reall Kings, exalted unto Thrones; And more than Golden Thrones! 'Tis this I do, Letting Poëtick Strains and Shadows go. I cannot imitat their vulgar Sence Who Cloaths admire, but not the Man they fence Against the Cold; and while they wonder at His Rings, his precious Stones, his Gold and Plate; The middle piece, his Body and his Mind, They over-look; no Beauty in them find: God's Works they slight, their own they magnify, His they contemn, or careless pass them by; Their woven Silks and wel-made Suits they prize, Valu their Gems, but not more precious Eys: Their Useful Hands, their Tongues and Ruby Lips, Their polisht Flesh where whitest Lillies mix With blushing Roses and with saphire Veins, The Bones, the Joints, and that which els remains Within that curious Fabrick, Life and Strength, I'th' wel-compacted bredth and depth and length Of various Limbs, that living Engins be Of glorious worth; God's Work they will not see: Nor yet the Soul, in whose concealed Face, Which comprehendeth all unbounded Space, GOD may be seen; tho she can understand The Length of Ages and the Tracts of Land That from the Zodiac do extended ly Unto the Poles, and view Eternity. Ev'n thus do idle Fancies, Toys, and Words, (Like gilded Scabbards sheathing rusty Swords) Take vulgar Souls; who gaze on rich Attire But God's diviner Works do ne'r admire. T. T. The Publisher To the Reader. The faithful Watch-man being gon to rest From's pious Labors, which he did not spare To spend himself in; as All those attest Who e'r convers'd with him, and know the Care And earnest Pains which he did always take To keep their drowzy Faculties awake: Lest thy dull Soul should sleep the Sleep of Death For lack of som such Means to ope thine Eys; Lo, he yet speaks, tho dead and void of Breath, In such a manner as may make thee wise Unto Salvation; if a serious Thought Thou fix upon what in this Book is wrote. Which I do for no other End produce, But that his lively Notions of God's Lov, (Whose Works and Ways it was his constant Use By Night to contemplat, by Day improv In all his Talk) may cure that gross Neglect Of our tru Joys which doth the Earth infect. Truths common, tho not heeded, to thy View I here present; And, that they mayn't do less Than rouz thy Sens, if not thy Sight renew, Shew the Divine cloath'd in a Poët's Dress, To win Acceptance: for we all descry, When Precepts cannot, Poëms take the Ey. And let the Soul that borrows hence a Spark Of Light; so blow it up into a Flame Of Holy Lov, as may not in the Dark Suppress the Benefit: but to God's Name Giv all the Thanks and Prais (whom the Author meant To honor) and not him the Instrument. Amen. Divine Reflections ON THE NATIVE OBJECTS OF An Infant=Ey. O Lord, open thou my Lips, and my Mouth shall shew forth Thy Prais. Psal. 51. 15. The Salutation. These little Limbs, These Eys and Hands which here I find, This panting Heart wherwith my Life begins; Where have ye been? Behind What Curtain were ye from me hid so long! Where was, in what Abyss, my new-made Tongue? When silent I So many thousand thousand Years Beneath the Dust did in a Chaos ly, How could I Smiles, or Tears, Or Lips, or Hands, or Eys, or Ears perceiv? Welcom ye Treasures which I now receiv. I that so long Was Nothing from Eternity, Did little think such Joys as Ear and Tongue To celebrat or see: Such Sounds to hear, such Hands to feel, such Feet, Such Eys and Objects, on the Ground to meet. New burnisht Joys! Which finest Gold and Pearl excell! Such sacred Treasures are the Limbs of Boys In which a Soul doth dwell: Their organized Joints and azure Veins More Wealth include than the dead World conteins. From Dust I rise And out of Nothing now awake; These brighter Regions which salute mine Eys A Gift from God I take: The Earth, the Seas, the Light, the lofty Skies, The Sun and Stars are mine; if these I prize. A Stranger here, Strange things doth meet, strange Glory see, Strange Treasures lodg'd in this fair World appear, Strange all and New to me: But that they mine should be who Nothing was, That Strangest is of all; yet brought to pass. Wonder. How like an Angel came I down! How bright are all things here! When first among his Works I did appear O how their Glory did me crown! The World resembled his ETERNITY, In which my Soul did walk; And evry thing that I did see Did with me talk. The Skies in their Magnificence, The lovly lively Air, Oh how divine, how soft, how sweet, how fair! The Stars did entertain my Sense; And all the Works of God so bright and pure, So rich and great, did seem, As if they ever must endure In my Esteem. A Nativ Health and Innocence Within my Bones did grow, And while my God did all his Glories show I felt a vigor in my Sense That was all SPIRIT: I within did flow With Seas of Life like Wine; I nothing in the World did know But 'twas Divine. Harsh rugged Objects were conceal'd, Oppressions, Tears, and Cries, Sins, Griefs, Complaints, Dissentions, weeping Eys, Were hid: And only things reveal'd Which hevenly Spirits and the Angels prize: The State of Innocence And Bliss, not Trades and Poverties, Did fill my Sense. The Streets seem'd paved with golden Stones, The Boys and Girls all mine; To me how did their lovly faces shine! The Sons of men all Holy ones In Joy and Beauty, then appear'd to me; And evry Thing I found (While like an Angel I did see) Adorn'd the Ground. Rich Diamonds, and Pearl, and Gold Might evry where be seen; Rare Colors, yellow, blew, red, white, and green Mine Eys on evry side behold: All that I saw, a Wonder did appear; Amazement was my Bliss: That and my Wealth met evry where. No Joy to this! Curs'd, ill-devis'd Proprieties With Envy, Avarice, And Fraud, (those Fiends that spoil ev'n Paradise) Were not the Object of mine Eys; Nor Hedges, Ditches, Limits, narrow Bounds: I dreamt not ought of those, But in surveying all mens Grounds I found Repose. For Property its self was mine, And Hedges, Ornaments: Walls, Houses, Coffers, and their rich Contents, To make me Rich combine. Cloaths, costly Jewels, Laces, I esteem'd My Wealth by others worn, For me they all to wear them seem'd, When I was born. Eden. A learned and a happy Ignorance Divided me From all the Vanity, From all the Sloth, Care, Sorrow, that advance The Madness and the Misery Of Men. No Error, no Distraction, I Saw cloud the Earth, or over-cast the Sky. I knew not that there was a Serpent's Sting, Whose Poyson shed On Men, did overspread The World: Nor did I dream of such a thing As Sin, in which Mankind lay dead. They all were brisk and living Things to me, Yea pure, and full of Immortality. Joy, Pleasure, Beauty, Kindness, charming Lov, Sleep, Life, and Light, Peace, Melody, my Sight Mine Ears and Heart did fill and freely mov; All that I saw did me delight: The Universe was then a World of Treasure To me an Universal World of Pleasure. Unwelcom Penitence I then thought not on; Vain costly Toys, Swearing and roaring Boys, Shops, Markets, Taverns, Coaches, were unknown, So all things were that drown my Joys: No Thorns choakt-up my Path, nor hid the face Of Bliss and Glory, nor eclypst my place. Only what Adam in his first Estate Did I behold; Hard Silver and dry Gold As yet lay under ground: My happy Fate Was more acquainted with the old And innocent Delights which he did see In his Original Simplicity. Those things which first his Eden did adorn, My Infancy Did crown: Simplicity Was my Protection when I first was born. Mine Eys those Treasures first did see Which God first made: The first Effects of Lov My first Enjoyments upon Earth did prov. And were so Great, and so Divine, so Pure, So fair and sweet, So tru; when I did meet Them here at first, they did my Soul allure, And drew away mine Infant-feet Quite from the Works of Men, that I might see The glorious Wonders of the DEITY. Innocence. 1 But that which most I wonder at, which most I did esteem my Bliss, which most I boast And ever shall applaud, is, that within I felt no Stain, no Spot of Sin. No Darkness then did over-shade, But all within was pure and bright, No Guilt did crush, nor Fear invade, But all my Soul was full of Light. A joyful Sense exempt from Fear Is all I can remember; The very Night to me was clear, 'Twas Summer in December. 2 A serious Meditation did employ My Soul within, which, taken up with Joy, Did seem no outward thing to note, but fly All Objects that do feed the Ey: While it those very Objects did Admire, and prize, and prais, and lov, Which in their Glory most are hid; Which Presence only doth remov: Their constant daily Presence I Rejoicing at did see; And that which takes them from the Ey Of others, offer'd them to me. 3 No inward Stain inclined my Will To Avarice or Pride: My Soul was still With Admiration fill'd; no Lust nor Strife Polluted then my Infant-Life. No Fraud nor Anger in me mov'd, No Malice, Jealousy, or Spight; All that I saw I truly lov'd. Contentment only and Delight Were in my Soul. O Hev'n, what Bliss Did I enjoy and feel! What powerful Delight did this Inspire! For this I daily kneel. 4 Whether it be that Nature is so pure, And Custom only vicious; or to cure Its Depravation, God did Guilt remov To fix in me a Sense of 's Lov So early; or that 'twas one Day Wherin this Happiness I found, Whose Strength and Brightness so do ray That still it seems me to surround: What e'r it was, it is a Light So endless unto me, That I a World of tru Delight Did then, and to this day do, see. 5 That Prospect was the Gate of Hev'n; that Day The ancient Light of Eden did convey Into my Soul: I was an Adam there, A little Adam in a Sphere Of Joys: O there my ravisht Sense Was entertain'd in Paradise; And had a Sight of Innocence Which was to mee beyond all Price. An Antepast of Heven sure! For I on Earth did reign: Within, without me, all was pure: I must becom a Child again. An Infant-Ey. A simple Light from all Contagion free, A Beam that's purely Spiritual, an Ey That's altogether Virgin, Things doth see Ev'n like unto the Deity: That is, it shineth in an hevenly Sence, And round about (unmov'd) its Light dispence. The visiv Rays are Beams of Light indeed, Refined, subtil, piercing, quick and pure; And as they do the sprightly Winds exceed, Are worthy longer to endure: They far out-shoot the Reach of Grosser Air, Which with such Excellence may not compare. But being once debas'd, they soon becom Less activ than they were before; and then After distracting Objects out they run, Which make us wretched Men. A simple Infant's Ey is such a Treasure That when 'tis lost, w' enjoy no reall Pleasure. O that my Sight had ever simple been! And never faln into a grosser state! Then might I evry Object still have seen (As now I see a golden Plate) In such an hev'nly Light, as to descry In it, or by it, my Felicity. As easily might soar aloft as mov On Earth; and things remote as well as nigh My Joys should be; and could discern the Lov Of God in my Tranquility. But Streams are heavy which the Winds can blow; Whose grosser body must needs move below. The East was once my Joy; and so the Skies And Stars at first I thought; the West was mine: Then Praises from the Mountains did arise. As well as Vapors: Evry Vine Did bear me Fruit; the Fields my Gardens were; My larger Store-house all the Hemisphere. But Wantonness and Avarice got in And spoil'd my Wealth; (I never to complain Can cease, till I am purged from my Sin And made an Infant once again:) So that my feeble and disabled Sense Reacht only Near Things with its Influence. A House, a Woman's Hand, a piece of Gold, A Feast, a costly Suit, a beauteous Skin That vy'd with Ivory, I did behold; And all my Pleasure was in Sin: Who had at first with simple Infant-Eys Beheld as mine ev'n all Eternities. O dy! dy unto all that draws thine Ey From its first Objects: let not fading Pleasures Infect thy Mind; but see thou carefully Bid them adieu. Return: Thy Treasures Abide thee still, and in their places stand Inviting yet, and waiting thy Command. The Return. To Infancy, O Lord, again I com, That I my Manhood may improv: My early Tutor is the Womb; I still my Cradle lov. 'Tis strange that I should Wisest be, When least I could an Error see. Till I gain strength against Temptation, I Perceiv it safest to abide An Infant still; and therfore fly (A lowly State may hide A man from Danger) to the Womb, That I may yet New-born becom. My God, thy Bounty then did ravish me! Before I learned to be poor, I always did thy Riches see, And thankfully adore: Thy Glory and thy Goodness were My sweet Companions all the Year. The Præparative. My Body being dead, my Limbs unknown; Before I skill'd to prize Those living Stars, mine Eys; Before or Tongue or Cheeks I call'd mine own, Before I knew these Hands were mine, Or that my Sinews did my Members join; When neither Nostril, foot, nor Ear, As yet could be discern'd, or did appear; I was within A House I knew not; newly cloath'd with Skin. Then was my Soul my only All to me, A living endless Ey, Scarce bounded with the Sky, Whose Power, and Act, and Essence was to see: I was an inward Sphere of Light, Or an interminable Orb of Sight, Exceeding that which makes the Days, A vital Sun that shed abroad his Rays: All Life, all Sense, A naked, simple, pure Intelligence. I then no Thirst nor Hunger did perceiv; No dire Necessity Nor Want was known to me: Without disturbance then I did receiv The tru Ideas of all Things, The Hony did enjoy without the Stings. A meditating inward Ey Gazing at Quiet did within me ly, And all things fair Delighted me that was to be their Heir. For Light inherits Beauty; Hearing, Sounds; The Nostril, sweet Perfumes; All Tastes have secret Rooms Within the Tongue; the Touching feeleth Wounds Of Pain or Pleasure; and yet I Forgat the rest, and was all Sight or Ey, Unbody'd and devoid of Care, Just as in Hev'n the Holy Angels are: For simple Sense Is Lord of all created Excellence. Being thus prepar'd for all Felicity; Not præpossest with Dross, Nor basely glued to gross And dull Materials that might ruin me, Nor fetter'd by an Iron Fate, By vain Affections in my earthy State, To any thing that should seduce My Sense, or els bereav it of its Use; I was as free As if there were nor Sin nor Misery. Pure nativ Powers that Corruption loath, Did, like the fairest Glass Or spotless polisht Brass, Themselvs soon in their Object's Image cloath: Divine Impressions, when they came, Did quickly enter and my Soul enflame. 'Tis not the Object, but the Light, That maketh Hev'n: 'Tis a clearer Sight. Felicity Appears to none but them that purely see. A disentangled and a naked Sense, A Mind that's unpossest, A disengaged Breast, A quick unprejudic'd Intelligence Acquainted with the Golden Mean, An eeven Spirit, quiet, and serene, Is that where Wisdom's Excellence And Pleasure keep their Court of Residence. My Soul get free, And then thou may'st possess Felicity. The Instruction. Spew out thy Filth, thy Flesh abjure, Let not Contingents thee defile; For Transients only are impure, And empty Things thy Soul beguile. Unfelt, unseen let those things be, Which to thy Spirit were unknown, When to thy blessed Infancy The World, thy Self, thy God, was shewn. All that is Great and stable stood Within thy harmless View at first; All that in Visibles is Good, Or Pure, or Fair, or Unaccurst. Whatever els thou now dost see In Custom, Action, or Desire, Is but a part of Misery Wherin all Men at once conspire. The Vision. Flight is but the Præparative: the Sight Is deep and infinit. Indeed, 'tis all the Glory, Light, and Space, The Joy and blest Variety That doth adorn the Godhead's Dwelling-place 'Tis all that Ey can see. Even Trades themselvs, view'd with celestial Sight, And Cares, and Sins, and Woes, giv Light. Order the Beauty ev'n of Beauty is, It is the Rule of Bliss, The very Life and Form and Caus of Pleasure; Which if we do not understand, Ten thousand heaps of vain, tho massy, Treasure Will but oppress the Land: In Blessedness its self we that shall miss (Being blind) which is the Sum of Bliss. First then behold the World as thine, and well Note that where thou dost dwell: See all the Beauty of the spacious Case; Lift up thy pleas'd and ravisht Eys; Admire the Glory of this hevenly Place, And all its Blessings prize. That Sight well seen thy Spirit that prepare To make all other things more rare. Mens Woes shal be but Foils unto thy Bliss, Thou once enjoying this: Trades shal adorn and beautify the Earth; Their Ignorance shall make thee bright; Were not their Griefs Democritus's Mirth? Their Slips shal keep thee right: All shall be thine Advantage; all conspire To make thy Bliss and Virtu higher. To see the glorious Fountain and the End; To see all Creatures tend To thy Advancement, and so sweetly close In thy Repose: To see them shine In serviceable Worth; and even Foes, Among the rest, made Thine: To see all these at once unite in thee Is to behold Felicity. To see the Fountain is a Blessed thing; It is to see the King Of Glory face to face: But yet the End, The deep and wondrous End, is more; In that the Fount we also comprehend, The Spring we there adore: For in the End the Fountain is best shewn, As by Effects the Caus is known. From One, to One, in One, to see All things; Perceiv the King of Kings My God and Portion; to see his Treasures Made all mine own, my Self the End Of his great Labors! 'Tis the Life of Pleasures To see my self His Friend! Who All Things finds convey'd to him alone, Must needs adore The Holy One. The Rapture. Sweet Infancy! O Hevenly Fire! O sacred Light! How fair and bright! How Great am I Whom the whol World doth magnify O hevenly Joy! O Great and Sacred Blessedness Which I possess! So great a Joy Who did into my Arms convey? From God abov Being sent, the Gift doth me enflame To prais his Name; The Stars do mov, The Sun doth shine, to shew his Lov. O how Divine Am I! To all this Sacred Wealth, This Life and Health, Who rais'd? Who mine Did make the same! What hand divine! News. News from a forein Country came, As if my Treasures and my Joys lay there; So much it did my Heart enflame, 'Twas wont to call my Soul into mine Ear; Which thither went to meet Th' approaching Sweet, And on the Threshold stood To entertain the secret Good; It hover'd there As if 'twould leav mine Ear, And was so eager to embrace Th' expected Tidings, as they came, That it could change its dwelling-place To meet the voice of Fame. As if new Tidings were the Things Which did comprise my wished unknown Treasure, Or els did bear them on their wings, With so much Joy they came, with so much Pleasure, My Soul stood at the Gate To recreäte It self with Bliss, and woo Its speedier Approach; a fuller view It fain would take, Yet Journeys back would make Unto my Heart, as if 'twould fain Go out to meet, yet stay within, Fitting a place to entertain And bring the Tidings in. What Sacred Instinct did inspire My Soul in Childhood with an hope so strong? What secret Force mov'd my Desire T' expect my Joys beyond the Seas, so yong? Felicity I knew Was out of view; And being left alone, I thought all Happiness was gon From Earth: for this I long'd-for absent Bliss, Deeming that sure beyond the Seas, Or els in somthing near at hand Which I knew not, since nought did pleas I knew, my Bliss did stand. But little did the Infant dream That all the Treasures of the World were by, And that himself was so the Cream And Crown of all which round about did ly. Yet thus it was! The Gem, The Diadem, The Ring enclosing all That stood upon this Earthen Ball; The hev'nly Ey, Much wider than the Sky, Wherin they All included were; The Lov, the Soul, that was the King Made to possess them, did appear A very little Thing. Felicity. Prompted to seek my Bliss abov the Skies, How often did I lift mine Eys Beyond the Spheres! Dame Nature told me there was endless Space Within my Soul; I spy'd its very face: Sure it not for nought appears. What is there which a Man may see Beyond the Spheres? FELICITY. There in the Mind of God, that Sphere of Lov, (In nature, hight, extent, abov All other Spheres,) A Man may see Himself, the World, the Bride Of God His Church, which as they there are ey'd Strangely exalted each appears: His Mind is higher than the Space Abov the Spheres, Surmounts all Place. No empty Space; it is all full of Sight, All Soul and Life, an Ey most bright, All Light and Lov; Which doth at once all things possess and giv, Heven and Earth, with All that therin liv; It rests at quiet, and doth mov; Eternal is, yet Time includes; A Scene abov All Interludes. Adam's Fall. God made Man upright at the first; Man made himself by Sin accurst: Sin is a Deviation from the Way Of God: 'Tis that wherin a Man doth stray From the first Path wherin he was to walk, From the first Theme he was to talk. His Talk was to be all of Prais, Thanksgiving, Rapture, Holy-days; For nothing els did with his State agree: Being full of Wonder and Felicity, He was in thankful sort to meditate Upon the Throne in which he sate. No Gold, nor Trade, nor Silver there, Nor Cloaths, no Coin, nor Houses were No gaudy Coaches, Feasts, or Palaces, Nor vain Inventions newly made to pleas; But Native Truth, and Virgin-Purity, An uncorrupt Simplicity. His faithful Heart, his Hands, and Eys He lifted up unto the Skies; The Earth he wondring kneel'd upon; the Air, He was surrounded with; the Trees, the fair And fruitful Fields, his needful Treasures were; And nothing els he wanted there. The World its self was his next Theme, Wherof himself was made Supream: He had an Angel's Ey to see the Price Of evry Creature; that made Paradise: He had a Tongue, yea more, a Cherub's Sense To feel its Worth and Excellence. Encompass'd with the Fruits of Lov, He crowned was with Heven abov, Supported with the Foot-stool of God's Throne, A Globe more rich than Gold or precious Stone, The fertil Ground of Pleasure and Delight, Encircled in a Sphere of Light. The Sense of what He did possess Fill'd him with Joy and Thankfulness; He was transported even here on Earth, As if he then in Heven had his Birth: The truth is, Heven did the Man surround, The Earth being in the middle found. The World. When Adam first did from his Dust arise, He did not see, Nor could there be A greater Joy before his Eys: The Sun as bright for me doth shine; The Spheres abov Do shew his Lov, While they to kiss the Earth incline, The Stars as great a Service do; The Moon as much I view As Adam did, and all God's Works divine Are Glorious still, and Mine. Sin spoil'd them; but my Savior's precious Blood Sprinkled I see On them to be, Making them all both safe and good: With greater Rapture I admire That I from Hell Redeem'd, do dwell On Earth as yet; and here a Fire Not scorching but refreshing glows, And living Water flows, Which Dives more than Silver doth request, Of Crystals far the best. What shal I render unto thee, my God, For teaching me The Wealth to see Which doth enrich thy Great Abode? My virgin-thoughts in Childhood were Full of Content, And innocent, Without disturbance, free and clear, Ev'n like the Streams of Crystal Springs, Where all the curious things Do from the bottom of the Well appear When no filth or mud is there. For so when first I in the Summer-fields Saw golden Corn The Earth adorn, (This day that Sight its Pleasure yields) No Rubies could more take mine Ey; Nor Pearls of price, By man's Device In Gold set artificially, Could of more worth appear to me, How rich so'er they be By men esteem'd; nor could these more be mine That on my finger shine. The azure Skies did with so sweet a smile, Their Curtains spread Abov my Head And with its hight mine Ey beguile; So lovly did the distant Green That fring'd the field Appear, and yield Such pleasant Prospects to be seen From neighb'ring Hills; no precious Stone, Or Crown, or Royal Throne, Which do bedeck the Richest Indian Lord, Could such Delight afford. The Sun, that gilded all the bordering Woods, Shone from the Sky To beautify My Earthly and my Hevenly Goods; Exalted in his Throne on high, He shed his Beams In golden Streams That did illustrat all the Sky; Those Floods of Light, his nimble Rays, Did fill the glittr'ing Ways, While that unsufferable piercing Ey The Ground did glorify. The choicest Colors, Yellow, Green, and Blew Did all this Court In comly sort With mixt varieties bestrew; Like Gold with Emeralds between; As if my God From his Abode By these intended to be seen. And so He was: I Him descry'd In's Works, the surest Guide Dame Nature yields; His Lov, His Life doth there For evermore appear. No House nor Holder in this World did I Observ to be: What I did see Seem'd all Mine Own; wherin did ly A Mine, a Garden, of Delights; Pearls were but Stones; And great King's Thrones, Compared with such Benefits, But empty Chairs; a Crown, a Toy Scarce apt to pleas a Boy. All other are but petty trifling Shews, To that which God bestows. A Royal Crown, inlaid with precious Stones, Did less surprize The Infant Eys Of many other little Ones, Than the great Beauties of this Frame, Made for my sake, Mine Eys did take, Which I Divine, and Mine, do name. Surprizing Joys beyond all Price Compos'd a Paradise, Which did my Soul to lov my God enflame, And ever doth the same. The Apostacy. One Star Is better far Than many Precious Stones: One Sun, which is by its own lustre seen, Is worth ten thousand Golden Thrones: A juicy Herb, or Spire of Grass, In useful Virtu, native Green, An Em'rald doth surpass; Hath int' more Valu, tho less seen. No Wars, Nor mortal Jars, Nor bloody Feuds, nor Coin, Nor Griefs which those occasion, saw I then; Nor wicked Thievs which this purloin: I had no Thoughts that were impure; Esteeming both Women and Men God's Work, I was secure, And reckon'd Peace my choicest Gem. As Eve I did believ My self in Eden set, Affecting neither Gold, nor Ermin'd Crowns, Nor ought els that I need forget; No Mud did foul my limpid Streams, No Mist eclypst my Sun with frowns; Set off with hev'nly Beams, My Joys were Meadows, Fields, and Towns. Those things Which Cherubins Did not at first behold Among God's Works, which Adam did not see; As Robes, and Stones enchas'd in Gold, Rich Cabinets, and such like fine Inventions; could not ravish me: I thought not Bowls of Wine Needful for my Felicity. All Bliss Consists in this, To do as Adam did; And not to know those superficial Joys Which were from him in Eden hid: Those little new-invented Things, Fine Lace and Silks, such Childish Toys As Ribbans are and Rings, Or worldly Pelf that Us destroys. For God, Both Great and Good, The Seeds of Melancholy Creäted not: but only foolish Men, Grown mad with customary Folly Which doth increase their Wants, so dote As when they elder grow they then Such Baubles chiefly note; More Fools at Twenty Years than Ten. But I, I know not why, Did learn among them too At length; and when I once with blemisht Eys Began their Pence and Toys to view, Drown'd in their Customs, I became A Stranger to the Shining Skies, Lost as a dying Flame; And Hobby-horses brought to prize. The Sun And Moon forgon, As if unmade, appear No more to me; to God and Heven dead I was, as tho they never were: Upon som useless gaudy Book, When what I knew of God, was fled, The Child being taught to look, His Soul was quickly murthered. O fine! O most divine! O brave! they cry'd; and shew'd Som Tinsel thing whose Glittering did amaze, And to their Cries its beauty ow'd; Thus I on Riches, by degrees, Of a new Stamp did learn to gaze; While all the World for these I lost: my Joy turn'd to a Blaze. Solitude. How desolate! Ah! how forlorn, how sadly did I stand When in the field my woful State I felt! Not all the Land, Not all the Skies, Tho Heven shin'd before mine Eys, Could Comfort yield in any Field to me, Nor could my Mind Contentment find or see. Remov'd from Town, From People, Churches, Feasts, and Holidays, The Sword of State, the Mayor's Gown, And all the Neighb'ring Boys; As if no Kings On Earth there were, or living Things, The silent Skies salute mine Eys, the Seas My Soul surround; no Rest I found, or Eas. My roving Mind Search'd evry Corner of the spacious Earth, From Sky to Sky, if it could find, (But found not) any Mirth: Not all the Coasts, Nor all the great and glorious Hosts, In Hev'n or Earth, did any Mirth afford; No welcom Good or needed Food, my Board. I do believ, The Ev'ning being shady and obscure, The very Silence did me griev, And Sorrow more procure: A secret Want Did make me think my Fortune scant. I was so blind, I could not find my Health, No Joy mine Ey could there espy, nor Wealth. Nor could I ghess What kind of thing I long'd for: But that I Did somwhat lack of Blessedness, Beside the Earth and Sky, I plainly found; It griev'd me much, I felt a Wound Perplex me sore; yet what my Store should be I did not know, nothing would shew to me. Ye sullen Things! Ye dumb, ye silent Creatures, and unkind! How can I call you Pleasant Springs Unless ye eas my Mind! Will ye not speak What 'tis I want, nor Silence break? O pity me, and let me see som Joy; Som Kindness shew to me, altho a Boy. They silent stood; Nor Earth, nor Woods, nor Hills, nor Brooks, nor Skies, Would tell me where the hidden Good, Which I did long for, lies: The shady Trees, The Ev'ning dark, the humming Bees, The chirping Birds, mute Springs and Fords, conspire, While they deny to answer my Desire. Bells ringing I Far off did hear, som Country Church they spake; The Noise re-ecchoing throu the Sky My Melancholy brake; When't reacht mine Ear Som Tidings thence I hop'd to hear: But not a Bell me News could tell, or shew My longing Mind, where Joys to find, or know. I griev'd the more, 'Caus I therby somwhat encorag'd was That I from thence should learn my Store; For Churches are a place That nearer stand Than any part of all the Land To Hev'n; from whence som little Sense I might To help my Mind receiv, and find som Light. They louder sound Than men do talk, somthing they should disclose; The empty Sound did therfore wound Becaus not shew Repose. It did revive To think that Men were there alive; But had my Soul, call'd by the Toll, gon in, I might have found, to eas my Wound, a Thing. A little Eas Perhaps, but that might more molest my Mind; One flatt'ring Drop would more diseas My Soul with Thirst, and grind My Heart with grief: For People can yield no Relief In publick sort when in that Court they shine, Except they mov my Soul with Lov divine. Th' External Rite, Altho the face be wondrous sweet and fair, Can satiate my Appetit No more than empty Air Yield solid Food. Must I the best and highest Good Seek to possess; or Blessedness in vain (Tho 'tis alive in som place) strive to gain? O! what would I Diseased, wanting, melancholy, giv To find that tru Felicity, The place where Bliss doth liv? Those Regions fair Which are not lodg'd in Sea nor Air, Nor Woods, nor Fields, nor Arbour yields, nor Springs, Nor Hev'ns shew to us below, nor Kings. I might hav gon Into the City, Market, Tavern, Street, Yet only chang'd my Station, And strove in vain to meet That Eas of Mind Which all alone I long'd to find: A common Inn doth no such thing betray, Nor doth it walk in Peeple's Talk, or Play. O Eden fair! Where shall I seek the Soul of Holy Joy Since I to find it here despair; Nor in the shining Day, Nor in the Shade, Nor in the Field, nor in a Trade I can it see? Felicity! O where Shall I thee find to eas my Mind! O where! Poverty. As in the House I sate Alone and desolate, No Creature but the Fire and I, The Chimney and the Stool, I lift mine Ey Up to the Wall, And in the silent Hall Saw nothing mine But som few Cups and Dishes shine The Table and the wooden Stools Where Peeple us'd to dine: A painted Cloth there was Wherin som ancient Story wrought A little entertain'd my Thought Which Light discover'd throu the Glass. I wonder'd much to see That all my Wealth should be Confin'd in such a little Room, Yet hope for more I scarcely durst presume. It griev'd me sore That such a scanty Store Should be my All: For I forgat my Eas and Health, Nor did I think of Hands or Eys, Nor Soul nor Body prize; I neither thought the Sun, Nor Moon, nor Stars, nor Peeple, mine, Tho they did round about me shine; And therfore was I quite undon. Som greater things I thought Must needs for me be wrought, Which till my craving Mind could see I ever should lament my Poverty: I fain would have Whatever Bounty gave; Nor could there be Without, or Lov or Deity: For, should not He be Infinit Whose Hand created me? Ten thousand absent things Did vex my poor and wanting Mind, Which, till I be no longer blind, Let me not see the King of Kings. His Lov must surely be Rich, infinit, and free; Nor can He be thought a God Of Grace and Pow'r, that fills not his Abode, His Holy Court, In kind and liberal sort; Joys and Pleasures, Plenty of Jewels, Goods, and Treasures, (To enrich the Poor, cheer the forlorn) His Palace must adorn, And given all to me: For till His Works my Wealth became, No Lov, or Peace did me enflame: But now I have a DEITY. Dissatisfaction. In Cloaths confin'd, my weary Mind Persu'd Felicity; Throu ev'ry Street I ran to meet My Bliss: But nothing would the same disclose to me. What is, O where, the place of holy Joy! Will nothing to my Soul som Light convey! In ev'ry House I sought for Health, Searcht ev'ry Cabinet to spy my Wealth, I knockt at ev'ry Door, Askt ev'ry Man I met for Bliss, In ev'ry School, and Colledg, sought for this: But still was destitute and poor. My piercing Eys unto the Skies I lifted up to see; But no Delight my Appetit Would sate; Nor would that Region shew Felicity: My Fate Deny'd the same; Abov the Sky, Yea all the Hev'n of Hev'ns, I lift mine Ey; But nothing more than empty Space Would there discover to my Soul its face. Then back dissatisfy'd To Earth I came; among the Trees, In Taverns, Houses, Feasts, and Palaces, I sought it, but was still deny'd. Panting and faint, full of Complaint, I it persu'd again, In Diadems, and Eastern Gems, In Bags Of Gold and Silver: But got no more Gain Than Rags, Or empty Air, or Vanity; Nor did the Temples much more signify: Dirt in the Streets; in Shops I found Nothing but Toil. Walls only me surround Or worthless Stones or Earth; Dens full of Thievs, and those of Blood Complaints and Widows Tears: no other Good Could there descry, no Hev'nly Mirth. Mens Customs here but vile appear; The Oaths of Roaring Boys, Their Gold that shines, their sparkling Wines, Their Lies, Their gawdy Trifles, are mistaken Joys: To prize Such Toys I loath'd. My Thirst did burn; But where, O whither should my Spirit turn! Their Games, their Bowls, their cheating Dice, Did not compleat, but spoil, my Paradise. On things that gather Rust, Or modish Cloaths, they fix their minds, Or sottish Vanity their Fancy blinds, Their Eys b'ing all put out with Dust. Sure none of these, sensless as Trees, Can shew me tru Repose. Philosophy! canst thou descry My Bliss? Will Books or Sages it to me disclose? I miss Of this in all: They tell me Pleasure, Or earthly Honor, or a fading Treasure, Will never with it furnish me. But then, Where is? What is, Felicity? Here Men begin to doat, Stand unresolv'd, they cannot speak, What 'tis; and all or most that Silence break Discover Nothing but their Throat. Weary of all that since the Fall Mine Eys on Earth can find, I for a Book from Heven look, Since here No Tidings will salute or eas my Mind: Mine Ear, My Ey, my Hand, my Soul, doth long For som fair Book fill'd with Eternal Song. O that! my Soul: for that I burn: That is the Thing for which my Heart did yern. Diviner Counsels there; The Joys of God, the Angels Songs, The secret Causes which employ their Tongues, Will surely pleas when they appear. What Sacred Ways! What hev'nly Joys! Which Mortals do not see? What hidden Springs! What glorious Things Abov! What kind of Life among them led may be In Lov! What Causes of Delight they have! What pleasing joyous Objects God them gave! This mightily I long'd to know; Oh, that som Angel these would to me shew! How full, divine, and pure, Their Bliss may be, including All Things visible or invisible, which shall To Everlasting firm endure. O this! In this I hop'd for Bliss; Of this I dreamt by Night: For this by Day I gasping lay; Mine Eys For this did fail: For this, my great Delight The Skies Became, in hopes they would disclose My Sacred Joys, and my desir'd Repose. Oh! that som Angel would bring down The same to me; That Book should be my Crown. I breathe, I long, I seek: Fain would I find, but still deny'd, I sought in ev'ry Library and Creek Until the Bible me supply'd. The Bible. That! That! There I was told That I the Son of God am made, His Image. O Divine! And that fine Gold, With all the Joys that here do fade, Are but a Toy, compared to the Bliss Which Hev'nly, God-like, and Eternal is. That We on earth are Kings; And, tho we're cloath'd with mortal Skin, Are Inward Cherubins; hav Angels Wings; Affections, Thoughts, and Minds within, Can soar throu all the Coasts of Hev'n and Earth; And shall be sated with Celestial Mirth. Christendom. When first mine Infant-Ear Of Christendom did hear, I much admired what kind of Place or Thing It was of which the Folk did talk: What Coast, what Region, what therin Did mov, or might be seen to walk. My great Desire Like ardent fire Did long to know what Things did ly behind That Mystic Name, to which mine Ey was blind. Som Depth it did conceal, Which, till it did reveal Its self to me, no Quiet, Peace, or Rest, Could I by any Means attain; My earnest Thoughts did me molest Till som one should the thing explain: I thought it was A Glorious Place, Where Souls might dwell in all Delight and Bliss; So thought, yet fear'd that I the Truth might miss: Among ten thousand things, Gold, Silver, Cherub's Wings, Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, a Church with Spires, Masks, Stages, Games and Plays, That then might suit my yong Desires, Feathers and Farthings, Holidays, Cards, Musick, Dice, So much in price; A City did before mine Eys present Its self, wherin there reigned sweet Content. A Town beyond the Seas, Whose Prospect much did pleas, And to my Soul so sweetly raise Delight As if a long expected Joy, Shut up in that transforming Sight, Would into me its Self convey; And Blessedness I there possess, As if that City stood on my own Ground, And all the Profit mine which there was found. Whatever Force me led, My Spirit sweetly fed On these Conceits; That 'twas a City strange, Wherin I saw no gallant Inns, No Markets, New or Old Exchange, No Childish Trifles, useless Things; Nor any Bound That Town surround; But as if all its Streets ev'n endless were; Without or Gate or Wall it did appear. Things Native sweetly grew, Which there mine Ey did view, Plain, simple, cheap, on either side the Street, Which was exceeding fair and wide; Sweet Mansions there mine Eys did meet; Green Trees the shaded Doors did hide: My chiefest Joys Were Girls and Boys That in those Streets still up and down did play, Which crown'd the Town with constant Holiday. A sprightly pleasant Time, (Ev'n Summer in its prime), Did gild the Trees, the Houses, Children, Skies, And made the City all divine; It ravished my wondring Eys To see the Sun so brightly shine: The Heat and Light Seem'd in my sight With such a dazling Lustre shed on them, As made me think 'twas th' New Jerusalem. Beneath the lofty Trees I saw, of all Degrees, Folk calmly sitting in their doors; while som Did standing with them kindly talk, Som smile, som sing, or what was don Observ, while others by did walk; They view'd the Boys And Girls, their Joys, The Streets adorning with their Angel-faces, Themselvs diverting in those pleasant Places. The Streets like Lanes did seem, Not pav'd with Stones, but green, Which with red Clay did partly mixt appear; 'Twas Holy Ground of great Esteem; The Spring's choice Liveries did wear Of verdant Grass that grew between The purling Streams, Which golden Beams Of Light did varnish, coming from the Sun, By which to distant Realms was Service don. In fresh and cooler Rooms Retir'd they dine: Perfumes They wanted not, having the pleasant Shade And Peace to bless their House within, By sprinkled Waters cooler made, For those incarnat Cherubin. This happy Place, With all the Grace The Joy and Beauty which did it beseem, Did ravish me and highten my Esteem. That here to rais Desire All Objects do conspire, Peeple in Years, and Yong enough to play, Their Streets of Houses, common Peace, In one continued Holy day Whose gladsom Mirth shall never cease: Since these becom My Christendom, What learn I more than that Jerusalem Is mine, as 'tis my Maker's, choicest Gem. Before I was aware Truth did to me appear, And represented to my Virgin-Eys Th' unthought of Joys and Treasures Wherin my Bliss and Glory lies; My God's Delight, (which givs me Measure) His Turtle Dov, Is Peace and Lov In Towns: for holy Children, Maids, and Men Make up the King of Glory's Diadem. On Christmas-Day. Shall Dumpish Melancholy spoil my Joys While Angels sing And Mortals ring My Lord and Savior's Prais! Awake from Sloth, for that alone destroys, 'Tis Sin defiles, 'tis Sloth puts out thy Joys. See how they run from place to place, And seek for Ornaments of Grace; Their Houses deckt with sprightly Green, In Winter makes a Summer seen; They Bays and Holly bring As if 'twere Spring! Shake off thy Sloth, my drouzy Soul, awake; With Angels sing Unto thy King, And pleasant Musick make; Thy Lute, thy Harp, or els thy Heart-strings take, And with thy Musick let thy Sense awake. See how each one the other calls To fix his Ivy on the walls, Transplanted there it seems to grow As if it rooted were below: Thus He, who is thy King, Makes Winter, Spring. Shall Houses clad in Summer-Liveries His Praises sing And laud thy King, And wilt not thou arise? Forsake thy Bed, and grow (my Soul) more wise, Attire thy self in cheerful Liveries: Let pleasant Branches still be seen Adorning thee, both quick and green; And, which with Glory better suits, Be laden all the Year with Fruits; Inserted into Him, For ever spring. 'Tis He that Life and Spirit doth infuse: Let ev'ry thing The Praises sing Of Christ the King of Jews; Who makes things green, and with a Spring infuse A Season which to see it doth not use: Old Winter's Frost and hoary hair, With Garland's crowned, Bays doth wear; The nipping Frost of Wrath b'ing gon, To Him the Manger made a Throne, Du Praises let us sing, Winter and Spring. See how, their Bodies clad with finer Cloaths, They now begin His Prais to sing Who purchas'd their Repose: Wherby their inward Joy they do disclose; Their Dress alludes to better Works than those: His gayer Weeds and finer Band, New Suit and Hat, into his hand The Plow-man takes; his neatest Shoos, And warmer Glovs, he means to use: And shall not I, my King, Thy Praises sing? See how their Breath doth smoak, and how they haste His Prais to sing With Cherubim; They scarce a Break-fast taste; But throu the Streets, lest precious Time should waste, When Service doth begin, to Church they haste. And shall not I, Lord, com to Thee, The Beauty of thy Temple see? Thy Name with Joy I will confess, Clad in my Savior's Righteousness; 'Mong all thy Servants sing To Thee my King. 'Twas thou that gav'st us Caus for fine Attires; Ev'n thou, O King, As in the Spring, Dost warm us with thy fires Of Lov: Thy Blood hath bought us new Desires Thy Righteousness doth cloath with new Attires. Both fresh and fine let me appear This Day divine, to close the Year; Among the rest let me be seen A living Branch and always green, Think it a pleasant thing Thy Prais to sing. At break of Day, O how the Bells did ring? To thee, my King, The Bells did ring; To thee the Angels sing: Thy Goodness did produce this other Spring, For this it is they make the Bells to ring: The sounding Bells do throu the Air Proclaim thy Welcom far and near; While I alone with Thee inherit All these Joys, beyond my Merit. Who would not always sing To such a King? I all these Joys, abov my Merit, see By Thee, my King, To whom I sing, Entire convey'd to me. My Treasure, Lord, thou mak'st the Peeple be That I with pleasure might thy Servants see. Ev'n in their rude external ways They do set forth my Savior's Prais, And minister a Light to me; While I by them do hear to Thee Praises, my Lord and King, Whole Churches ring. Hark how remoter Parishes do sound! Far off they ring For thee, my King, Ev'n round about the Town: The Churches scatter'd over all the Ground Serv for thy Prais, who art with Glory crown'd. This City is an Engin great That makes my Pleasure more compleat; The Sword, the Mace, the Magistrate, To honor Thee attend in State; The whole Assembly sings; The Minster rings. Bells. I. Hark! hark, my Soul! the Bells do ring, And with a louder voice Call many Families to sing His publick Praises, and rejoice: Their shriller Sound doth wound the Air, Their grosser Strokes affect the Ear, That we might thither all repair And more Divine ones hear. If Lifeless Earth Can make such Mirth, What then shall Souls abov the starry Sphere! Bells are but Clay that men refine And rais from duller Ore; Yet now, as if they were divine, They call whole Cities to adore; Exalted into Steeples they Disperse their Sound, and from on high Chime-in our Souls; they ev'ry way Speak to us throu the Sky: Their iron Tongues Do utter Songs, And shall our stony Hearts make no Reply! From darker Mines and earthy Caves At last let Souls awake, And leaving their obscurer Graves From lifeless Bells example take; Lifted abov all earthly Cares, Let them (like these) rais'd up on high, Forsaking all the baser Wares Of dull Mortality, His Praises sing, Tunably ring, In a less Distance from the peaceful Sky. II. From Clay, and Mire, and Dirt, my Soul, From vile and common Ore, Thou must ascend; taught by the Toll In what fit place thou mayst adore; Refin'd by fire, thou shalt a Bell Of Prais becom, in Mettal pure; In Purity thou must excell, No Soil or Grit endure. Refin'd by Lov, Thou still abov Like them must dwell, and other Souls allure. Doth not each trembling Sound I hear Make all my Spirits dance? Each Stroak's a Message to my Ear That casts my Soul into a Trance Of Joy: They're us'd to notify Religious Triumphs, and proclaim The Peace of Christianity, In Jesus holy Name. Authorities And Victories Protect, increas, enrich, adorn the same. Kings, O my Soul, and Princes now Do prais His holy Name, Their golden Crowns and Scepters bow In Honor of my Lord: His Fame Is gon throu-out the World, who dy'd Upon the Cross for me: And He That once was basely crucify'd Is own'd a Deity. The Higher Pow'rs Hav built these Tow'rs Which here aspiring to the Sky we see. Those Bells are of a piece, and sound, Whose wider mouths declare Our Duty to us: Being round And smooth and whole, no Splinters are In them, no Cracks, nor holes, nor flaws That may let out the Spirits thence Too soon; that would harsh jarring caus And lose their Influence. We must unite If we Delight Would yield or feel, or any Excellence. Churches. I. Those stately Structures which on Earth I view To GOD erected, whether Old or New; His Sacred Temples which the World adorn, Much more than Mines of Ore or Fields of Corn, My Soul delight: How do they pleas mine Ey When they are fill'd with His Great Family! Upon the face of all the peepl'd Earth There's no such sacred Joy or solemn Mirth, To pleas and satisfy my Heart's Desire, As that wherwith my Lord is in a Quire, In holy Hymns by warbling Voices prais'd, With Eys lift up, and joint Affections rais'd. The Arches built (like Hev'n) wide and high Shew his Magnificence and Majesty Whose House it is: With so much Art and Cost The Pile is fram'd, the curious Knobs embost, Set off with Gold, that me it more doth pleas Than Princes Courts or Royal Palaces; Great Stones pil'd up by costly Labors there Like Mountains carv'd by human Skill appear; Where Towers, Pillars, Pinnacles, and Spires Do all concur to match my great Desires, Whose Joy it is to see such Structures rais'd To th' end my God and Father should be prais'd. II. Were there but one alone Wherin we might approach his Throne, One only where we should accepted be, As in the Days of old It was, when Solomon of Gold His Temple made; we then should see A numerous Host approaching it, Rejoicing in the Benefit: The Queen of Sheba com With all her glorious Train, The Pope from Rome, The Kings beyond the Main; The Wise men of the East from far, As guided by a Star, With Rev'rence would approach that Holy Ground, At that sole Altar be adoring found. Great Lords would thither throng, And none of them without a Song Of Prais; Rich Merchants also would approach From ev'ry forein Coast; Of Ladies too a shining Host, If not on Hors-back, in a Coach; This Single Church would crouded be With Men of Great and High Degree: Princes we might behold With glitt'ring Scepters there In-laid with Gold And precious Stones, draw near. No Room for mean Ones there would be, Nor place for Thee and Me: An endless Troop would crouding there appear, Bringing new Presents daily ev'ry Year. But now we Churches have In ev'ry Coast, which Bounty gave Most freely to us; now they sprinkled stand With so much Care and Lov, Tokens of Favor from abov, That men might com in ev'ry Land To them with greater Eas; lo, we Those blest Abodes neglected see: As if our God were worse Becaus His Lov is more, And doth disburse Its self in greater Store; Nor can object with any face The Distance of the place; Ungrateful We with slower haste do com Unto his Temple, 'caus 'tis nearer home. Misapprehension. Men are not wise in their Tru Interest, Nor in the Worth of what they long possest: They know no more what is their Own Than they the Valu of't have known. They pine in Misery, Complain of Poverty, Reap not where they hav sown, Griev for Felicity, Blaspheme the Deity; And all becaus they are not blest With Eys to see the Worth of Things: For did they know their Reall Interest, No doubt they'd all be Kings. There's not a Man but covets and desires A Kingdom, yea a World; nay, he aspires To all the Regions he can spy Beyond the Hev'ns Infinity: The World too little is To be his Sphere of Bliss; Eternity must be The Object of his View And his Possession too; Or els Infinity's a Dream That quickly fades away; He lovs All Treasures; but he hates a failing Stream That dries up as it movs. Can Fancy make a Greater King than God? Can Man within his Soveraign's Abode Be dearer to himself than He That is the Angels Deity? Man is as wel belov'd As they, if he improv'd His Talent as we see They do; and may as well In Blessedness excell. But Man hath lost the ancient Way, That Road is grown into Decay; Brambles shut up the Path, and Briars tear Those few that pass by there. They think no Realms nor Kingdoms theirs, No Lands nor Houses, that have other Heirs. But native Sense taught me more Wit, The World did too, I may admit: As soon as I was born It did my Soul adorn, And was a Benefit That round about me lay; And yet without Delay 'Twas seated quickly in my Mind, Its Uses also I yet find Mine own: for God, that All things would impart, Center'd it in my Heart. The World set in Man's Heart, and yet not His! Why, all the Compass of this great Abyss, Th' united Service and Delight, Its Beauty that attracts the Sight, That Goodness which I find, Doth gratify my Mind; The common Air and Light That shines, doth me a Pleasure And surely is my Treasure: Of it I am th' inclusive Sphere, It doth entire in me appear As well as I in it: It givs me Room, Yet lies within my Womb. The Improvment. 'Tis more to recollect than make; the one Is but an Accident without the other: We cannot think the World to be the Throne Of God, unless his Wisdom shine as Brother Unto his Power, in the Fabrick, so That we the one may in the other know. His Goodness also must in both appear, And All the Children of his Lov be found, In the Creation of the Starry Sphere, And in the framing of the fruitful Ground, Before we can that Happiness descry Which is the Daughter of the DEITY. His Wisdom's seen in ord'ring this Great House; His Power shines in governing the Sun; His Goodness doth exceeding Marvellous Appear in ev'ry Thing His Hand hath don: And all his Works, in their Variety, United or asunder, pleas the Ey. But neither Goodness, Wisdom, Power, nor Lov, Nor Happiness its self, in things could be, Did they not all in one fair Order mov, And jointly by their Service end in Me. Had He not made an Ey to be the Sphere Of all these Things, How could their Use appear? His Wisdom, Goodness, Power, as they unite All Things in One, that they may be the Treasures Of one Enjoyer, reach the utmost Hight They can attain; and are then Our Pleasures, When all the Univers combines in One T' exalt a Creature, as if that alone. To make the Product of far distant Seas Meet in a point, be present to mine Ey In Virtu, not in Bulk; one Man to pleas With His wise Conduct of the Hevens high; From East and West, and North, and South to bring The useful Influence of ev'ry Thing; Is far more Great than to create them where They now do stand; His Wisdom more approv'd, So do His Might and Goodness more appear, In recollecting All that should be lov'd, That All might be a Gift to ev'ry One, Than in the sev'ral Parts of His wide Throne. By wise Contrivance He doth All things guide, And so dispose them, that while they unite, For Man He endless Pleasures doth provide, And shews that Happiness is His Delight; His Creature's Happiness, as well as His: For that in Truth he seeks; and that's his Bliss. O Rapture! Wonder! Ecstasy! Delight! How Great then must His Glory be! How great Our Blessedness! How vast and infinit Our Pleasure! How transcendent! How compleat! If We the Goodness of our GOD possess, And all His Joy be in Our Blessedness. Almighty Power, when it is employ'd For One, that he with Glory might be crown'd; Eternal Wisdom, when it is enjoy'd By One, whom all its Beauties do surround; Produce a Creature that will all his Days Return the Sacrifice of Endless Prais. But, Oh! The Vigor of mine Infant-Sense Drives me too far: I had not yet the Ey, The Apprehension, or Intelligence, Of things so very Great, Divine, and High. To me the Off-spring of Eternity, And mine they were, and therfore pleas'd mine Ey. That was enough at first. Eternity, Infinity, and Lov, were silent Joys; Pow'r, Wisdom, Goodness, and Felicity; All these, which now our Care and Sin destroys, By Instinct virtually I did discern, And by their Representatives did learn. As Spunges gather Moisture from the Earth Wheron there is scarce any Sign of Dew; As Air infecteth Salt; so at my Birth All these were unperceiv'd, yet near and tru: Not by Reflection, or distinctly known; But, by their Efficacy, all mine own. The Odour. These Hands are Jewels to the Ey, Like Wine, or Oil, or Hony, to the Taste: These Feet which here I wear beneath the Sky Are us'd, yet never waste. My Members all do yield a sweet Perfume; They minister Delight, yet not consume. Ye living Gems, how Tru! how Near! How Reall, Useful, Pleasant! O how Good! How Valuable! yea, how Sweet! how Fair! B'ing once well understood! A Gem retains its Worth by being intire, Sweet Scents diffus'd do gratify Desire. Can melting Sugar sweeten Wine? Can Light communicated keep its Name? Can Jewels solid be, tho they do shine? Embody'd Fire flame? Ye solid are, and yet do Light dispence; Abide the same, tho yield an Influence. Your Uses flow while ye abide: The Services which I from you receiv Like sweet Infusions throu me daily glide Ev'n while they Sense deceiv, B'ing unobserv'd: for only Spirits see What Treasures Services and Uses be. The Services which from you flow Are such diffusiv Joys as know no measure; Which shew His boundless Lov who did bestow These Gifts to be my Treasure. Your Substance is the Tree on which it grows; Your Uses are the Oil that from it flows. Thus Hony flows from Rocks of Stone; Thus Oil from Wood; thus Cider, Milk, and Wine, From Trees and Flesh; thus Corn from Earth; to one That's hev'nly and divine. But He that cannot like an Angel see, In Heven its self shall dwell in Misery. If first I learn not what's Your Price Which are alive, and are to me so near; How shall I all the Joys of Paradise, Which are so Great and Dear, Esteem? Gifts ev'n at distance are our Joys, But lack of Sense the Benefit destroys. Liv to thy Self; thy Limbs esteem: From Hev'n they came; with Mony can't be bought, And b'ing such Works as God himself beseem, May precious well be thought. Contemplat then the Valu of this Treasure, By that alone thou feelest all the Pleasure. Like Amber fair thy Fingers grow; With fragrant Hony-sucks thy Head is crown'd; Like Stars, thine Eys; thy Cheeks like Roses shew: All are Delights profound. Talk with thy self; thy self enjoy and see: At once the Mirror and the Object be. What's Cinnamon, compar'd to thee? Thy Body is than Cedars better far: Those Fruits and Flowers which in Fields I see, With thine, can not compare. Where thou hast mov'd aright, the Scent I find Of fragrant Myrrh and Aloes left behind. But what is Myrrh? What Cinnamon? What Aloes, Cassia, Spices, Hony, Wine? O sacred Uses! You to think upon Than these I more incline. To see, taste, smell, observ; is to no End, If I the Use of each don't apprehend. Admiration. Can Human Shape so taking be, That Angels com and sip Ambrosia from a Mortal Lip! Can Cherubims descend with Joy to see God in his Works beneath! Can Mortals breath FELICITY! Can Bodies fill the hev'nly Rooms With welcom Odours and Perfumes! Can Earth-bred Flow'rs adorn Celestial Bowers Or yield such Fruits as pleas the hev'nly Powers! Then may the Seas with Amber flow; The Earth a Star appear; Things be divine and hevenly here. The Tree of Life in Paradise may grow Among us now: the Sun Be quite out-don By Beams that shew More bright than his: Celestial Mirth May yet inhabit all this Earth. It cannot be! Can Mortals be so blind? Hav Joys so near them, which they never mind? The Lilly and the Rosy-Train Which, scatter'd on the ground, Salute the Feet which they surround, Grow for thy sake, O Man; that like a Chain Or Garland they may be To deck ev'n thee: They all remain Thy Gems; and bowing down their head Their liquid Pearl they kindly shed In Tears; as if they meant to wash thy Feet, For Joy that they to serv thee are made meet. The Sun doth smile, and looking down From Hev'n doth blush to see Himself excelled here by thee: Yet frankly doth dispers his Beams to crown A Creature so divine; He lovs to shine, Nor lets a Frown Eclyps his Brow, becaus he givs Light for the Use of one that livs Abov himself. Lord! What is Man that he Is thus admired like a Deity! The Approach. That Childish Thoughts such Joys inspire Doth make my Wonder and his Glory higher; His Bounty and My Wealth more great; It shews his Kingdom and his Work compleat; In which there is not any thing But what may be improv'd by God my King. He in our Childhood with us walks, And with our Thoughts mysteriously He talks; He often visiteth our Minds, But cold Acceptance frequently He finds: We often send Him griev'd away, Els He would oftner com and longer stay. O Lord, I wonder at thy Lov Which did my Infancy so early mov: But more at that which did forbear And mov'd so long, tho slighted many a Year: But most of all, O God, that thou Shouldst me at last convert I scarce know how. Thy Gracious Motions oft in Vain Assaulted me: My Heart did hard remain Long time: I sent my God away Much griev'd that He could not impart His Joy. I careless was, nor did regard The End for which He all these Thoughts prepar'd. But now with new and open Eys I see beneath as if abov the Skies: When I on what is past reflect His Thoughts and Mine I plainly recollect: He did approach me, nay, did woo; I wonder that my God so much would do. From Nothing taken first I was: What wondrous things His Goodness brought to pass! Now in this World I Him discern, And what His Dealings with me meant I learn, He sow'd in me Seeds of Delights That might grow up to future Benefits. Of Thoughts His Goodness long before Prepar'd a precious and celestial Store; And with such curious Art in-laid, That Childhood might its self alone be said My Tutor, Teacher, Guide to be; Ev'n then instructed by the Deity. Nature. That Custom is a Second Nature, we Most plainly find by Nature's Purity: For Nature teacheth nothing but the Truth; I'm sure mine did so in my Virgin-Youth. As soon as He my Spirit did inspire, His Works He bid me in the World admire. My Senses were Informers of my Heart, The Conduits of His Glory, Pow'r, and Art: His Greatness, Wisdom, Goodness, I did see, Endearing Lov, and vast Eternity, Almost as soon as born; and ev'ry Sense Was in me like to som Intelligence. I was by nature prone and apt to lov All Light and Beauty, both in Hev'n abov And Earth beneath; was ready to admire, Adore and prais, as well as to desire. My Inclinations rais'd me up on high, And guided me to trace Infinity. A secret Self I had enclos'd within, That was not bounded with my Cloaths or Skin, Or terminated with my Sight, whose Sphere Ran parallel with that of Heven here: And did, much like the subtil piercing Light, When fenc'd from rough and boistrous Storms by night, Break throu the Lanthorn-sides, and with its Ray Diffuse its Glory spreading evry way: Whose steddy Beams, too subtil for the Wind, Are such that we their Bounds can hardly find. It did encompass and possess Rare Things, But yet felt more; and on Angelick Wings Pierc'd throu the Skies immediatly, and sought For all that could beyond all Worlds be thought. It did not go or mov, but in me stood, And by dilating of its self, all Good It try'd to reach; I found it present there, Ev'n while it did remain conversing here; And more suggested than I could discern, Or ever since by any means could learn. Vast, unaffected, wonderful, Desires, Like nativ, ardent, inward, hidden Fires, Sprang up, with Expectations very strange, Which into stronger Hopes did quickly change; For all I saw beyond the Azure Round Seem'd endless Darkness, with no Beauty crown'd. Why Light should not be there as well as here; Why Goodness should not likewise there appear; Why Treasures and Delights should bounded be Since there is such a wide Infinity: These were the Doubts and Troubles of my Soul, By which we may perceiv (without controul) A World of endless Joys by Nature made That needs must always flourish, never fade. A wide, magnificent, and spacious Sky, A Fabrick worthy of the Deity; Clouds here and there like winged Chariots flying Flowers ever flourishing, yet always dying; A Day of Glory where I all things see Enricht with Beams of Light as 'twere for me; And that, after the Sun withdraws his Light, Succeeded with a shady glorious Night; The Moon and Stars shedding their Influence On all things, as appears to common Sense: With secret Rooms in Times and Ages more Past and to com, enlarging my great Store. These all in Order present unto me My happy Eys were able then to see, With other Wonders, to my Soul unknown Till they by Men and Reading first were shewn. And yet there were many new Regions more Into all which my new-fledg'd Soul did soar, Whose endless Spaces, like a Cabinet, Were fill'd with various joys in order set. The Empty, like to wide and vacant Room For Fancy to enlarge in, and presume A Space for more, not fathom'd yet, implies The Boundlessness of what I ought to prize. Here I was seated to behold New Things In th' August Mansion of the King of Kings; And All was mine. The Author yet not known, But that there must be one was plainly shewn; Which Fountain of Delights must needs be Lov, As all the Goodness of the Things did prov: Of whose Enjoiment I am made the End, While, how the same is so, I comprehend. Eas. How easily doth Nature teach the Soul! How irresistible is her Infusion! There's Nothing found that can her Force controll But Sin. How weak and feeble's all Delusion! Things false are forc'd and most elaborate; Things pure and tru are obvious unto Sense: The first Impressions in our earthly State Are made by Things of highest Excellence. How easy is it to believ the Sky Is wide, and great, and fair! How soon may we Be made to know the Sun is bright, and high, And very glorious, when its Beams we see! That all the Earth is one continu'd Globe; And that all Men therin are Living Treasures; That Fields and Meadows like a glorious Robe Adorn it with variety of Pleasures. That all we see is Ours, and evry One Possessor of the whole: That evry Man Is like a God incarnat in his Throne, Ev'n as the first for whom the World began. Whom All are taught to honor, serv, and lov, Becaus he is Belov'd of God most High, And therfore ev'ry Man is plac'd abov His Brother, for the Proof of Charity. That all may happy be, each one most blest Both in himself and others; All supream, While All by Each, and Each by All possest; Are inter-mutual Joys, beyond a Dream. This shews a wise Contrivance, and discovers A Great Creätor sitting on the Throne, Who so disposeth things for all His Lovers, That evry One might reign, like God, Alone. Dumness. Sure Man was born to meditat on things, And to contemplat the Eternal Springs Of God and Nature, Glory, Bliss, and Pleasure; That Life and Lov might be his chiefest Treasure: And therfore Speechless made at first, that he Might in himself profoundly busied be; Not giving vent before he hath ta'n in Such Antidotes as guard his Soul from Sin. Wise Nature made him Deaf too, that he might Not be disturb'd while he doth take Delight In inward Things; nor be deprav'd with Tongues, Nor injur'd by the Errors and the Wrongs That mortal Words convey: For Sin and Death Are most infused by accursed Breath That, flowing from corrupted Intrails, bear Those hidden Plagues which Souls may justly fear. This, (my dear Friends) this was my blessed Case; For, nothing spake to me but the fair Face Of Hev'n and Earth, when yet I could not speak: I did my Bliss, when I did Silence, break. My Non-Intelligence of Human Words Ten thousand Pleasures unto me affords: For, while I knew not what to me they said; Before Their Souls were into Mine convey'd; Before that Living Vehicle of Wind Did breathe into me their infected Mind; Before My Thoughts with Theirs were levened, The Gate of Souls as yet not opened: Then did I dwell within a World of Light Retir'd and separat from all mens Sight; Where I did feel strange Thoughts, and Secrets see That were (or seem'd) only reveal'd to Me: There I saw all the World enjoy'd by One; There All Things seem'd to end in Me alone: No Business serious deem'd, but that which is Design'd to perfect my Eternal Bliss. D'ye ask me What? It was for to admire The Satisfaction of all Just Desire: 'Twas to be pleas'd with all that God had don: 'Twas to enjoy All that's beneath the Sun: 'Twas with a steddy, quick, and lively Sense Duly to estimat the Excellence Of all God's Works: T' inherit endless Treasure, And to be fill'd with Everlasting Pleasure: To prize, and prais. Thus was I shut within A Fort impregnable to any Sin, Till the Avenues being open laid, Whole Legions enter'd, and the Fort betray'd. Yer which unhappy time, within my Mind A Temple and a Teacher I could find, With a large Text to comment on: No Ear, But Eys themselvs were all the Hearers there; And evry Stone and evry Star a Tongue, And evry Gale of Wind a Psalm or Song: The Hevens were an Oracle, and spake Divinity; the Earth did undertake The Office of a Priest; and I b'ing dumb, (Nothing besides was so) All things did com With Voices and Instructions. But when I Had learnt to speak, their Pow'r began to dy: Mine Ears let other Noises in, not theirs; A Noise disturbing all my Hymns and Pray'rs: My Foes pull'd down my Temple to the ground, And my untainted Soul did deeply wound; Marr'd all my inward Faculties; destroy'd The Oracle, and all I there enjoy'd. Yet to mine Infancy what first appear'd; Those Truths which (being Speechless) I had heard, Preventing all the rest, got such a Root Within my Heart, and stick so close unto 't; It may be trampled on; but still will grow, And Nutriment to Soil its self will ow. The first Impressions are immortal all: And let my Foes cry ne'r so loud, or call; Yet these still whisper, if I will but hear, And penetrat the Heart, if not the Ear. My Spirit. My naked simple Life was I: That Act so strongly shin'd Upon the Earth, the Sea, the Sky, It was the Substance of the Mind; The Sense its self was I. I felt no Dross nor Matter in my Soul, No Brims nor Borders, such as in a Bowl We see: My Essence was Capacity. That felt all things; The Thought that springs There-from's its Self: It hath no other Wings To spread abroad, nor Eys to see, No pair of Hands to feel, Nor Knees to kneel: But being Simple, like the Deity, In its own Center is a Sphere, Not limited, but evry-where. It acts not from a Center to Its Object, as remote; But present is, where it doth go To view the Being it doth note: What ever it doth do, It doth not by another Engin mov, But by and of its self doth Activ prov: Its Essence is transform'd into a tru And perfect Act. And so exact Hath God appear'd in this mysterious Fact, That 'tis all Ey, all Act, all Sight; Nay, what it pleas can be; Not only see Or do: for 'tis more voluble than Light, Which can put on ten thousand Forms, Being cloath'd with what its self adorns. This made me present evermore With whatsoere I saw. An Object, if it were before Mine Ey, was by Dame Nature's Law Within my Soul: Her Store Was all at once within me; all her Treasures Were my immediat and internal Pleasures; Substantial Joys, which did inform my Mind. With all she wrought My Soul was fraught, And evry Object in my Heart, a Thought Begot or was: I could not tell Whether the Things did there Themselvs appear, Which in my Spirit truly seem'd to dwell: Or whether my conforming Mind Were not ev'n all that therin shin'd. But yet of this I was most sure, That at the utmost length (So worthy is it to endure) My Soul could best express its Strength: It was so quick and pure That all my Mind was wholy Evry-where; What-e'r it saw, 'twas actually there; The Sun, ten-thousand Stages off, was nigh; The utmost Star, Tho seen from far, Was present in the Apple of mine Ey: There was my Sight, my Life, my Sense, My Substance, ev'n my Mind: My Spirit shin'd Ev'n there, not by a transeunt Influence. The Act was immanent, yet there; The Thing remote, yet felt ev'n here. O Joy! O Wonder and Delight! O sacred Mystery! My Soul a Spirit wide and bright! An Image of the Deity! A most Substantial Light! That being Greatest which doth Nothing seem! Why, 'twas my All: I nothing did esteem But that alone; A strange, a living Sphere! A deep Abyss That sees and is The only proper Place of hev'nly Bliss. To its Creätor 'tis so near In Lov and Excellence, In Life and Sense, In spiritual Worth and Frame; so Dear: That it, without Hyperbole, Is own'd His Son and Friend to be. A strange extended Orb of Joy Proceeding from within, Which did on evry side display Its force; and being nigh of Kin To God, did evry way Dilate its Self ev'n instantaneously, Yet an Indivisible Center stay, In it surrounding all Eternity. 'Twas not a Sphere; Yet did appear One infinit: 'Twas somwhat evry-where. And what it had a Power to see, On that it always shin'd: For 'twas a Mind Exerted, reaching to Infinity: 'Twas not a Sphere; but 'twas a Power More high and lasting than a Tower. O wondrous Self! O Sphere of Light! Emblem of Day most fair! O Pow'r and Act, next Infinit, Like subtil and unbounded Air! O Living Orb of Sight! Thou that within me art, my Self! An Ey Or Temple of a wide Infinity! O What a World art Thou! a World within! In thee appear All Things, and are Alive in Thee! super-substantial, rare, Abov themselvs, and near a-kin To those pure Things we find In His Great Mind Who made the World! Tho now eclyps'd by Sin, Yet this within my Intellect Is found, when on it I reflect. Silence. A quiet silent Person may possess All that is Great or Good in Blessedness: The Inward Work is the Supream; for all The other were occasion'd by the Fall. A man, that seemeth Idle to the view Of others, may the greatest Business do: Those Acts which Adam in his Innocence Was to perform, had all the Excellence: Others which he knew not (how good so-e'r) Are meaner Matters, of a lower Sphere; Building of Churches; Giving to the Poor; In Dust and Ashes lying on the floor; Administring of Justice; Preaching Peace; Plowing and Toiling for a forc'd Increas; With Visiting the Sick, or Governing The Rude and Ignorant. This was a thing As then unknown: for neither Ignorance, Nor Poverty, nor Sickness, did advance Their Banner in the World, till Sin came in; Since that, these to be needful did begin. The first and only Work he had to do, Was, of his Bliss to take a grateful View; In all the Goods he did possess, rejoice; Sing Praises to his God with cheerful voice; T' express his hearty Thanks, and inward Lov, Which is the best accepted Work abov Them all. And this at first was mine: These were My Exercises of the highest Sphere. To see, approv, take pleasure, and rejoice In Heart; is better than the loudest Nois. No Melody in Words can equal that: The sweetest Organ, Lute, or Harp, is flat And dull, compar'd therto. O! that I still Could prize my Father's Lov and Holy Will! This is to honor, worship, and adore; This is to fear Him; nay, it is far more: 'Tis to enjoy him, and to imitate The very Life and Bliss of His High 'State: 'Tis to receiv with holy Reverence His mighty Gifts, and with a fitting Sense Of pure Devotion, and Humility, To prize his Works, his Lov to magnify. O happy Ignorance of other Things, Which made me present with the King of Kings, And like Him too! All Spirit, Life, and Power, Wreathed into a never-fading Bower. A World of Innocence as then was mine, In which the Joys of Paradise did shine; And while I was not here, I was in Heven, Not Resting One, but evry Day, in Seven: At all times minding with a lively Sense The Univers in all its Excellence. No other Thoughts did intervene, to cloy, Divert, extinguish, or eclyps my Joy: No Worldly Customs, new-found Wants or Dreams Invented here, polluted my pure Streams: No Wormwood-Star into my Sea did fall; No rotten Seed, or Bitterness of Gall, Tainted my Soul. From all Contagion free, I could discern with an unclouded Ey, In that fair World One onely was the Friend, One Spring, one living Stream, one only End; There only One did sacrifise and sing To only One Eternal Hev'nly King: The Union was so strict betwixt the Two, That All was Either's which my Soul did view; His Gifts, and my Possessions, both our Treasures; He Mine, and I the Ocean of His Pleasures: He was an Ocean of Delights, from whom The Springs of Life and Streams of Bliss did com; My Bosom was an Ocean into which They all did run, that me they might enrich. A vast and measure-less Capacity Enlarg'd my Soul like to the Deity, In whose mysterious Mind and potent Hand All Ages and all Worlds together stand; Who, tho He nothing said, did always reign, And in Himself Eternity contain. When in my Soul the King of Kings did sit, The World was more in me, than I in it. And to Himself, in Me, He ever gave All that He takes Delight to see me have. Ev'n thus my Spirit was an Endless Sphere, Like God himself; He, Hev'n, and Earth, being there. Right Apprehension. [I.] Giv but to things their tru Esteem, And those which now so vile and worthless seem Will so much fill and pleas the Mind, That we shall there the only Riches find, How wise was I In Infancy! I then saw in the clearest Light; But corrupt Custom is a second Night. Custom; that must a Trophy be When Wisdom shall compleat her Victory: For Trades, Opinions, Errors, are False Lights, but yet receiv'd to set off Ware More false: We're sold For worthless Gold. Diana was a Goddess made That Silver-Smiths might have the better Trade. But giv to Things their tru Esteem, And then what's magnify'd most vile will seem: What commonly's despis'd, will be The truest and the greatest Rarity. What Men should prize They all despise; The best Enjoiments are abus'd; The Only Wealth by Madmen is refus'd. A Globe of Earth is better far Than if it were a Globe of Gold: A Star Much brighter than a precious Stone: The Sun more Glorious than a Costly Throne; His warming Beam, A living Stream Of liquid Pearl, that from a Spring Waters the Earth, is a most precious thing. What Newness once suggested to, Now clearer Reason doth improv, my View: By Novelty my Soul was taught At first; but now Reality my Thought Inspires: And I Perspicuously Each way instructed am; by Sense Experience, Reason, and Intelligence. A Globe of Gold must Barren be, Untill'd and Useless: We should neither see Trees, Flowers, Grass, or Corn Such a Metalline Massy Globe adorn: As Splendor blinds, So Hardness binds; No Fruitfulness it can produce; A Golden World can't be of any Use. Ah me! This World is more divine: The Wisdom of a God in this doth shine. What ails Mankind to be so cross? The Useful Earth they count vile Dirt and Dross: And neither prize Its Qualities, Nor Donor's Lov. I fain would know How or why Men God's Goodness disallow. The Earth's rare ductile Soil, Which duly yields unto the Plow-man's Toil, Its fertile Nature, givs Offence; And its Improvment by the Influence Of Hev'n; For, these Do not well pleas, Becaus they do upbraid Mens hardned Hearts, And each of them an Evidence imparts Against the Owner; whose Design It is that Nothing be reputed fine, Nor held for any Excellence, Of which he hath not in himself the Sense. He too well knows That no Fruit grows In him, Obdurat Wretch, who yields Obedience to Hev'n, less than the Fields: But being, like his loved Gold, Stiff, barren, and impen'trable; tho told He should be otherwise: He is Uncapable of any hev'nly Bliss. His Gold and he Do well agree; For he's a formal Hypocrite, Like that Unfruitful, yet on th' outside bright. Ah! Happy Infant! Wealthy Heir! How blessed did the Hev'n and Earth appear Before thou knew'st there was a thing Call'd Gold! Barren of Good; of Ill the Spring Beyond Compare! Most quiet were Those Infant-Days, when I did see Wisdom and Wealth couch'd in Simplicity. II. If this I did not evry moment see, And if my Thoughts did stray At any time, or idly play, And fix on other Objects: yet This Apprehension set In me Secur'd my Felicity. Fulness. That Light, that Sight, that Thought, Which in my Soul at first He wrought, Is sure the only Act to which I may Assent this day: The Mirror of an endless Life; The Shadow of a Virgin-Wife; A Spiritual Creätion within; An Universe enclos'd in Skin: My Power exerted, or my perfect Being, If not Enjoying, yet an Act of Seeing: My Bliss Consists in this; My Duty too In this I view. It is a Fountain, or a Spring Refreshing me in evry thing; From whence those living Streams I do derive, By which my thirsty Soul is kept alive. The Center and the Sphere Of my Delights are here: It is my David's Tower Where all my Armor lies, The Fountain of my Power, My Bliss, my Sacrifice; A little Spark That shining in the dark Makes and encorages my Soul to rise. The Root of Hope, the Golden Chain; Whose End is, as the Poets feign, Fasten'd to the very Throne Of JOVE: It is a Stone On which I sit; An endless Benefit, That, being made my Regal Throne, Doth prov An Oracle of His Eternal Lov. Speed. The liquid Pearl in Springs, The useful and the precious Things, Are in a moment known: Their very Glory does reveal their Worth; (And that doth set their Glory forth.) As soon as I was born they all were shewn. Tru living Wealth did flow In Crystal-Streams below My feet; and trilling down In tru, substantial and immaculat Pleasure, (A precious and diffusiv Treasure,) At once my Body fed, and Soul did crown. I was as high and great As Kings are in their Seat: All other Things were mine; The World my House, the Creatures were my Goods; Fields, Mountains, Vallies, Woods, Men and their Arts, to make me Rich combine. Great, fair, and valuable, Various and innumerable, Most useful and divine, (Such as to be my Treasures fittest were,) The Sacred Objects did appear, All full of Worth, as well as Mine. New all! New polisht Joys; Tho now by other Toys Eclypst: New all, and mine. This Sacred Truth more welcom seem'd to me, Becaus the Best of Things I see Were mine, which shew'd my State to be divine. Nor did the Angels Faces, The Glories and the Graces, The Beauty, Peace, and Joy Of Hev'n its self, more Sweetness yield to me. Till cursed Sin did all destroy, These were the Off-spring of the Deity. The Choice. When first Eternity stoopt down to Nought And in the Earth its Likeness sought; When first it out of Nothing fram'd the Skies, And form'd the Moon and Sun That we might see what it had don; It was so wise That it did prize Things truly Greatest, fittest, fairest, best: All such it made, and left the rest. Then did it take such Care about the Truth, Its Daughter, that, ev'n in her Youth, Her Face might shine upon us, and be known; That by a better Fate It other Toys might antedate, As soon as shewn; And be our own, While we are Hers: And that a Virgin Lov Her best Inheritance might prov. Thoughts undefiled, holy, good, and pure, Thoughts worthy ever to endure, Our first and disengaged Thoughts it lovs; And therfore made the Truth, In Infancy and tender Youth, So obvious to Our native View That it doth prepossess our Soul, and provs The Caus of what it always movs. By Merit and Desire it doth allure, For Truth is so divine and pure, So rich and acceptable, being seen, (Not parted but i'th' whole) That it doth draw and force my Soul, As the Great Queen Of Bliss, between Whom and the Soul no one Pretender ought Thrust in, to captivat a Thought. Hence did Eternity contrive to make The Truth so winning for our sake, That being Truth, and fair, and easy too, While it on all doth shine, We might by it becom divine; B'ing led to woo The thing we view, And as chast Virgins early with it join, That by it we might likewise shine. Eternity doth giv the Richest Things To evry Man, and makes all Kings: The Best and Choicest Things it doth convey To All and evry One. It raised Me unto a Throne! Which I enjoy. In such a way, That Truth her Daughter is my Only Bride, Her Daughter Truth's my chiefest Pride. All mine! And seen so easily! How blest! How soon am I of all possest! My Infancy no sooner opes its Eys But strait the spacious Earth Abounds with Glory, Peace, and Mirth. If thou be Wise, The very Skies And all abov them are Thine Own; possest In such a way as is the Best. The Person. Ye sacred Limbs, A richer Blazon I will lay On you, than first I found: That, like Celestial Kings, Ye might with Ornaments of Joy Be always crown'd. A deep Vermilion on a Red, On that a Scarlet, I will lay; With Gold I'll crown your Head, Which like the Sun shall ray: With Robes of Glory and Delight I'll make you bright. Mistake me not: I do not mean to bring New Robes, but to display the thing; Nor paint, nor cloath, nor crown, nor add a Ray; But glorify by taking all away. The Naked Things Are most sublime, and brightest shew, When they alone are seen: Mens Hands than Angels Wings Are truer Wealth, tho here below; For those but seem. Their Worth they then do best reveal When we all Metaphors remov; For, Metaphors conceal, And only Vapors prov. They best are blazon'd when we see Th' Anatomy, Survey the Skin, cut up the Flesh, the Veins Unfold; the Glory there remains: The Muscles, Fibres, Arteries, and Bones, Are better far than Artificial Stones. Shall I not then Delight in this most Sacred Treasure, Which my Great Father gave, Far more than other men Delight in Plate? Since these do pleasure And make us brave! Much braver than the Pearls and Gold That glitter on a Lady's Neck. The Rubies we behold, The Diamonds that deck The Hands of Queens, compar'd unto The Limbs we view; The whitest Lillies, blushing Roses, are Lest Ornaments to those that wear The same, than are the Hands, and Lips, and Eys Of them who those false Ornaments so prize. Let Verity Be thy Delight: Let me esteem Tru Wealth far more than Toys: Let Sacred Riches be, While the fictitious only seem, My Reall Joys: For Golden Chains and Bracelets are But gilded Manacles, wherby Old Satan doth ensnare, Allure, bewitch the Ey. Thy Gifts, O God, alone I'll prize, My Tongue, my Eys, My Cheeks, my Lips, mine Ears, my Hands, my Feet; Their Harmony is far more sweet, Their Beauty tru. And these, in all my Ways, Shall be the Themes and Organs of thy Prais. The Image. If I be like my God, my King, (Tho not a Cherubim,) I will not care, Since all my Pow'rs derived are From none but Him. The best of Images shall I Comprised in Me see; For I can spy All Angels in the Deity Like me to ly. The Estate. But shall my Soul no Wealth possess? No Outward Riches have? Shall Hands and Eys alone express Thy Bounty, which the Grave Will soon devour? Shall I becom Within my self a Living Tomb Of useless Wonders? Shall the fair, and brave, And great Endowments of my Soul ly waste; Which ought to be a Fountain and a Womb Of Praises unto Thee? Shall there no Outward Objects be For these to see and taste? Not so, my God, for other Joys and Pleasures Are the Occasion that my Limbs are Treasures. My Palat is a Touch-stone fit To taste how Good Thou art; My other Members second it, Thy Praises to impart: There's not an Ey that's fram'd by Thee But is thy Life and Lov to see: Nor is there, Lord, upon mine Head, an Ear, But that the Musick of Thy Works should hear: Each Toe, each Finger, by thy pow'rful Skill Created, should distill Ambrosia; more than Nectar flow From evry Joint I ow, B'ing well-imploy'd; for they Thy Holy Will Are activ Instruments made to fulfill. Elixirs richer are than Dross; The End is more divine Than are the Means: But Dung and Loss Materials (tho they shine Like Gold and Silver) are, compar'd To what Thy Spirit doth regard, Thy Will require, Thy Lov embrace, thy Mind Esteem, thy Wisdom most illustrious find. These are the Things God reckons His Reward; An grateful Heart that pays Homage to Him without Delays; A Tongue that's us'd to prais; A bended Knee; an Ey fixt on the Skies; A du Emploiment of our Faculties. For this the Hev'ns were made as well As Earth, the spacious Seas Are ours: the Stars that Gems excell, And Air, design'd to pleas Our Earthly part; the very Fire For Uses which our Needs require: The Orb of Light in its wide Circuit movs; Corn for our Food springs out of very Mire; Fences and Fewel grow in Woods and Groves; Choice Herbs and Flow'rs aspire To kiss our Feet; Beasts court our Lovs. How Glorious is Man's Fate! The Laws of God, the Works He did creäte, His ancient Ways, are His and My ESTATE. The Evidence. His Word confirms the Sale: Those Sheets enfold my Bliss: Eternity its self's the Pale Wherin my tru Estate enclosed is: Each ancient Miracle's a Seal: Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, Patriarchs are The Witnesses; and what their Words reveal, Their written Records do declare. All may well wonder such a 'State to see In such a solemn sort settled on me. Did not his Word proclaim My Title to th' Estate, His Works themselvs affirm the same By what they do; my Wish they antedate. Before I was conceiv'd, they were Allotted for my great Inheritance; As soon as I among them did appear They did surround me, to advance My Interest and Lov. Each Creature says, God made us Thine, that we might shew His Prais. The Services they do, Aloud proclaim them Mine; In that they are adapted to Supply my Wants; wherin they all combine To pleas and serv me, that I may God, Angels, Men, Fowls, Beasts, and Fish enjoy, Both in a natural and transcendent way; And to my Soul the Sense convey Of Wisdom, Goodness, Power, and Lov Divine, Which made them all, and made them to be mine. The Enquiry. Men may delighted be with Springs, (While Trees and Herbs their Senses pleas,) Reap a rich Harvest from the Earth and Seas; May think their Members things Of earthly Worth at least, if not divine; And sing, becaus the Sun doth for them shine: But can the Angels take Delight To see such Faces here beneath? Or can Perfumes from sordid Dunghills breath? Or is the World a Sight Worthy of them? Then may we Mortals be Joint-Heirs with them of wide Eternity. Ev'n Holy Angels may com down To walk on Earth, and find Delights That feed and pleas, ev'n here, their Appetites; Our Joys compose a Crown For them. Men in God's Tabernacle may be, Where Palm-Trees with the Cherubs mix'd we see. Mens Senses are indeed the Gems; Their Praises the most sweet Perfumes; Their God-like Souls do fill the hev'nly Rooms Where Angels walk: the Pens And Eys of those blest Spirits are employ'd To Note our Virtues, wherwith they are joy'd. The Wonders that our God hath don; The Glory of His Attributes, Like dangling Apples, or much better Fruits, Angelick Joys becom: They see His Wisdom and His Lov doth flow Like Myrrh or Incense, even here below. And Shall not We those Joys possess Which God for Man did chiefly make? The Angels have them only for Our sake! And yet, They do confess His Glory here on Earth to be sublime, His God-head in His Works appears Divine. Shadows in the Water. In unexperienc'd Infancy Many a sweet Mistake doth ly: Mistake tho false, intending tru; A Seeming somwhat more than View; That doth instruct the Mind In Things that ly behind, And many Secrets to us show Which afterwards we com to know. Thus did I by the Water's brink Another World beneath me think; And while the lofty spacious Skies Reversed there abus'd mine Eys, I fancy'd other Feet Came mine to touch or meet; As by som Puddle I did play Another World within it lay. Beneath the Water Peeple drown'd, Yet with another Hev'n crown'd, In spacious Regions seem'd to go As freely moving to and fro: In bright and open Space I saw their very face; Eys, Hands, and Feet they had like mine; Another Sun did with them shine. 'Twas strange that Peeple there should walk, And yet I could not hear them talk: That throu a little watry Chink, Which one dry Ox or Horse might drink, We other Worlds should see, Yet not admitted be; And other Confines there behold Of Light and Darkness, Heat and Cold. I call'd them oft, but call'd in vain; No Speeches we could entertain: Yet did I there expect to find Som other World, to pleas my Mind. I plainly saw by these A new Antipodes, Whom, tho they were so plainly seen, A Film kept off that stood between. By walking Men's reversed Feet I chanc'd another World to meet; Tho it did not to View exceed A Phantasm, 'tis a World indeed, Where Skies beneath us shine, And Earth by Art divine Another face presents below, Where Peeple's feet against Ours go. Within the Regions of the Air, Compass'd about with Hev'ns fair, Great Tracts of Land there may be found Enricht with Fields and fertil Ground; Where many num'rous Hosts, In those far distant Coasts, For other great and glorious Ends, Inhabit, my yet unknown Friends. O ye that stand upon the Brink, Whom I so near me, throu the Chink, With Wonder see: What Faces there, Whose Feet, whose Bodies, do ye wear? I my Companions see In You, another Me. They seemed Others, but are We; Our second Selvs those Shadows be. Look how far off those lower Skies Extend themselvs! scarce with mine Eys I can them reach. O ye my Friends, What Secret borders on those Ends? Are lofty Hevens hurl'd 'Bout your inferior World? Are ye the Representatives Of other Peopl's distant Lives? Of all the Play-mates which I knew That here I do the Image view In other Selvs; what can it mean? But that below the purling Stream Som unknown Joys there be Laid up in Store for me; To which I shall, when that thin Skin Is broken, be admitted in. On Leaping over the Moon. I saw new Worlds beneath the Water ly, New Peeple; yea, another Sky, And Sun, which seen by Day Might things more clear display. Just such another Of late my Brother Did in his Travel see, and saw by Night, A much more strange and wondrous Sight: Nor could the World exhibit such another, So Great a Sight, but in a Brother. Adventure strange! No such in Story we New or old, tru or feigned, see. On Earth he seem'd to mov Yet Heven went abov; Up in the Skies His Body flies In open, visible, yet Magick, sort: As he along the Way did sport Over the Flood he takes his nimble Course Without the help of feigned Horse. As he went tripping o'r the King's high-way, A little pearly River lay O'r which, without a Wing Or Oar, he dar'd to swim, Swim throu the Air On Body fair; He would not use nor trust Icarian Wings Lest they should prov deceitful things; For had he faln, it had been wondrous high, Not from, but from abov, the Sky: He might hav dropt throu that thin Element Into a fathomless Descent; Unto the nether Sky That did beneath him ly, And there might tell What Wonders dwell On Earth abov. Yet doth he briskly run, And bold the Danger overcom; Who, as he leapt, with Joy related soon How happy he o'r-leapt the Moon. What wondrous things upon the Earth are don Beneath, and yet abov, the Sun? Deeds all appear again In higher Spheres; remain In Clouds as yet: But there they get Another Light, and in another way Themselvs to us abov display. The Skies themselvs this earthly Globe surround; W'are even here within them found. On hev'nly Ground within the Skies we walk, And in this middle Center talk: Did we but wisely mov, On Earth in Hev'n abov, Then soon should we Exalted be Abov the Sky: from whence whoever falls, Through a long dismall Precipice, Sinks to the deep Abyss where Satan crawls Where horrid Death and Despair lies. As much as others thought themselvs to ly Beneath the Moon, so much more high Himself he thought to fly Above the starry Sky, As that he spy'd Below the Tide. Thus did he yield me in the shady Night A wondrous and instructiv Light, Which taught me that under our Feet there is, As o'r our Heads, a Place of Bliss. [To the same purpos; he, not long before] To the same purpos; he, not long before Brought home from Nurse, going to the door To do som little thing He must not do within, With Wonder cries, As in the Skies He saw the Moon, O yonder is the Moon Newly com after me to Town, That shin'd at Lugwardin but yesternight, Where I enjoy'd the self-same Light. As if it had ev'n twenty thousand faces, It shines at once in many places; To all the Earth so wide God doth the Stars divide With so much Art The Moon impart, They serv us all; serv wholy ev'ry One As if they served him alone. While evry single Person hath such Store, 'Tis want of Sense that makes us poor. Sight. Mine Infant-Ey Abov the Sky Discerning endless Place, Did make me see Two Sights in me, Three Eys adorn'd my Face: Two Luminaries in my Flesh Did me refresh; But one did lurk within, Beneath my Skin, That was of greater Worth than both the other; For those were Twins; but this had ne'r a Brother. Those Eys of Sense That did dispense Their Beams to nat'ral things, I quickly found In narrow Bound To know but earthly Springs. But that which throu the Hevens went Was excellent, And Endless; for the Ball Was Spirit'all: A visiv Ey things visible doth see; But with th' Invisible, Invisibles agree. One World was not (Be't ne'r forgot) Ev'n then enough for me: My better Sight Was infinit, New Regions I must see. In distant Coasts new Glories I Did long to spy: What this World did present Could not content; But, while I look'd on Outward Beauties here, Most earnestly expected Others there. I know not well What did me tell Of endless Space: but I Did in my Mind Som such thing find To be beyond the Sky That had no Bound; as certainly As I can see That I have Foot or Hand To feel or Stand: Which I discerned by another Sight Than that which grac'd my Body much more bright. I own it was A Looking-Glass Of signal Worth; wherin, More than mine Eys Could see or prize, Such things as Virtues win, Life, Joy, Lov, Peace, appear'd: a Light Which to my Sight Did Objects represent So excellent; That I no more without the same can see Than Beasts that have no tru Felicity. This Ey alone, (That peer hath none) Is such, that it can pry Into the End To which things tend, And all the Depths descry That God and Reason do include. By this are view'd The very Ground and Caus Of sacred Laws, All Ages too, Thoughts, Counsels, and Designs; So that no Light in Hev'n more clearly shines. Walking. To walk abroad is, not with Eys, But Thoughts, the Fields to see and prize; Els may the silent Feet, Like Logs of Wood, Mov up and down, and see no Good, Nor Joy nor Glory meet. Ev'n Carts and Wheels their place do change, But cannot see; tho very strange The Glory that is by: Dead Puppets may Mov in the bright and glorious Day, Yet not behold the Sky. And are not Men than they more blind, Who having Eys yet never find The Bliss in which they mov: Like Statues dead They up and down are carried, Yet neither see nor lov. To walk is by a Thought to go; To mov in Spirit to and fro; To mind the Good we see; To taste the Sweet; Observing all the things we meet How choice and rich they be. To note the Beauty of the Day, And golden Fields of Corn survey; Admire each pretty Flow'r With its sweet Smell; To prais their Maker, and to tell The Marks of His Great Pow'r. To fly abroad like activ Bees, Among the Hedges and the Trees, To cull the Dew that lies On evry Blade, From evry Blossom; till we lade Our Minds, as they their Thighs. Observ those rich and glorious things, The Rivers, Meadows, Woods, and Springs, The fructifying Sun; To note from far The Rising of each Twinkling Star For us his Race to run. A little Child these well perceivs, Who, tumbling in green Grass and Leaves, May Rich as Kings be thought, But there's a Sight Which perfect Manhood may delight, To which we shall be brought. While in those pleasant Paths we talk 'Tis that tow'rds which at last we walk; For we may by degrees Wisely proceed Pleasures of Lov and Prais to heed, From viewing Herbs and Trees. The Dialogue. Q. Why dost thou tell me that the fields are mine?A. Becaus for thee the fields so richly shine. Q. Am I the Heir of the Works of Men? A. For thee they dress, for thee manure them. Q. Did I my self by them intended see, That I the Heir of their Works should be, It well would pleas; But they themselvs intend: I therfore am not of their Works the End. A. The reall Benefit of all their Works, Wherin such mighty Joy and Beauty lurks, Derives its self to thee; to thee doth com, As do the Labors of the Shining Sun; Which doth not think on thee at all, my Friend, Yet all his Beams of Light on thee do tend: For thee they shine and do themselvs display; For thee, they do both make and gild the Day; For thee doth rise that glorious Orb of Light; For thee it sets, and so givs way for Night; That glorious Bridegroom daily shews his face, Adorns the World, and swiftly runs his Race, Disperseth Clouds, and raiseth Vapors too, Exciteth Winds, distills the Rain and Dew, Concocteth Mines, and makes the liquid Seas Contribute Moisture to the Neighb'ring Leas, Doth quicken Beasts, revive thy vital Powers, Thrusts forth the Grass, and beautifies thy Flowers, By tacit Causes animats the Trees, As they do Thee so he doth cherish Bees, Digesteth Mettals, raiseth Fruit and Corn, Makes Rivers flow, and Mountains doth adorn: All these it doth, not by its own Design, But by thy God's, which is far more divine; Who so disposeth Things, that they may be In Hev'n and Earth kind Ministers to Thee: And tho the Men that toil for Meat, and Drink, And Cloaths, or Houses, do not on Thee think; Yet all their Labors by His hevenly Care To Thee, in Mind or Body, helpful are: And that God thus intends thy single Self, Should pleas thee more, than if to heap up Wealth For Thee, all Men did work, and sweat, and bleed; Mean Thee alone (my Friend) in ev'ry Deed. Dreams. 'Tis strange! I saw the Skies; I saw the Hills before mine Eys; The Sparrow fly; The Lands that did about me ly; The reall Sun, that hev'nly Ey! Can closed Eys ev'n in the darkest Night See throu their Lids, and be inform'd with Sight? The Peeple were to me As tru as those by day I see; As tru the Air, The Earth as sweet, as fresh, as fair As that which did by day repair Unto my waking Sense! Can all the Sky, Can all the World, within my Brain-pan ly? What sacred Secret's this, Which seems to intimat my Bliss? What is there in The narrow Confines of my Skin, That is alive and feels within When I am dead? Can Magnitude possess An activ Memory, yet not be less? May all that I can see Awake, by Night within me be? My Childhood knew No Difference, but all was Tru, As Reall all as what I view; The World its Self was there. 'Twas wondrous strange, That Hev'n and Earth should so their place exchange. Till that which vulgar Sense Doth falsly call Experience, Distinguisht things: The Ribbans, and the gaudy Wings Of Birds, the Virtues, and the Sins, That represented were in Dreams by night As really my Senses did delight, Or griev, as those I saw By day: Things terrible did aw My Soul with Fear; The Apparitions seem'd as near As Things could be, and Things they were: Yet were they all by Fancy in me wrought, And all their Being founded in a Thought. O what a Thing is Thought! Which seems a Dream; yea, seemeth Nought, Yet doth the Mind Affect as much as what we find Most near and tru! Sure Men are blind, And can't the forcible Reality Of things that Secret are within them see. Thought! Surely Thoughts art tru; They pleas as much as Things can do: Nay Things are dead, And in themselvs are severed From Souls; nor can they fill the Head Without our Thoughts. Thoughts are the Reall things From whence all Joy, from whence all Sorrow springs. The Inference. I. Well-guided Thoughts within possess The Treasures of all Blessedness. Things are indifferent; nor giv Joy of themselvs, nor griev. The very Deity of God torments The male-contents Of Hell; To th' Soul alone it provs A welcom Object, that Him lovs. Things tru affect not, while they are unknown: But Thoughts most sensibly, tho quite alone. Thoughts are the inward Balms or Spears; The living Joys, or Griefs and Fears; The Light, or els the Fire; the Theme On which we pore or dream. Thoughts are alone by Men the Objects found That heal or wound. Things are but dead: they can't dispense Or Joy or Grief: Thoughts! Thoughts the Sense Affect and touch. Nay, when a Thing is near It can't affect but as it doth appear. Since then by Thoughts I only see; Since Thought alone affecteth me; Since these are Reall things when shewn; And since as Things are known Or thought, they pleas or kill: What Care ought I (Since Thoughts apply Things to my Mind) those Thoughts aright To frame, and watch them day and night; Suppressing such as will my Conscience stain, That Hev'nly Thoughts me hev'nly Things may gain. Ten thousand thousand Things are dead; Ly round about me; yet are fled, Are absent, lost, and from me gon; And those few Things alone, Or griev my Soul, or gratify my Mind, Which I do find Within. Let then the Troubles dy, The noisom Poisons buried ly: Ye Cares and Griefs avaunt, that breed Distress Let only those remain which God will bless. How many Thousands see the Sky, The Sun and Moon, as well as I? How many more that view the Seas, Feel neither Joy nor Eas? Those Things are dead and dry and banished. Their Life is led As if the World were yet unmade: A Feast, fine Cloaths, or els a Trade, Take up their Thoughts; and, like a grosser Skreen Drawn o'r their Soul, leav better Things unseen. But O! let me the Excellence Of God, in all His Works, with Sense Discern: Oh! let me celebrat And feel my blest Estate: Let all my Thoughts be fixt upon His Throne; And Him alone For all His gracious Gifts admire, Him only with my Soul desire: Or griev for Sin. That with du Sense, the Pleasure I may possess of His Eternal Treasure. II. David a Temple in his Mind conceiv'd; And that Intention was so well receiv'd By God, that all the Sacred Palaces That ever were did less His Glory pleas. If Thoughts are such; such Valuable Things; Such reall Goods; such human Cherubins; Material Delights; transcendent Objects; Ends Of all God's Works, which most His Ey intends. O! What are Men, who can such Thoughts produce, So excellent in Nature, Valu, Use? Which not to Angels only grateful seem, But God, most Wise, himself doth them esteem Worth more than Worlds? How many thousand may Our Hearts conceiv and offer evry Day? Holy Affections, grateful Sentiments, Good Resolutions, virtuous Intents, Seed-plots of activ Piety; He values more Than the Material World He made before. To such as these the Blessed-Virgin-Mother Of God's own Son, (rather than any other) Apply'd her Mind; for, of her pious Care To treasure up those Truths which she did hear Concerning Christ, in thoughtful Heart, w're told; But not that e'r with Offerings of Gold The Temple she enricht. This understood, How glorious, how divine, how great, how good May we becom! How like the Deity In managing our Thoughts aright! A Piety More grateful to our God than building Walls Of Churches, or the Founding Hospitalls: Wherin He givs us an Almighty Power To pleas Him so, that could we Worlds creäte, Or more New visible Earths and Hev'ens make, 'Twould be far short of this; which is the Flower And Cream of Strength. This we might plainly see, But that we Rebels to our Reason be. Shall God such sacred Might on us bestow? And not employ't to pay the Thanks we ow? Such grateful Offerings able be to giv; Yet them annihilat, and God's Spirit griev Consider that for All our Lord hath don, All that He can receiv is this bare Sum Of God-like Holy Thoughts: These only He Expects from Us, our Sacrifice to be. The City. What Structures here among God's Works appear? Such Wonders Adam ne'r did see In Paradise among the Trees, No Works of Art like these, Nor Walls, nor Pinnacles, nor Houses were. All these for me, For me these Streets and Towers, These stately Temples, and these solid Bowers, My Father rear'd: For me I thought they thus appear'd. The City, fill'd with Peeple, near me stood; A Fabrick like a Court divine, Of many Mansions bright and fair; Wherin I could repair To Blessings that were Common, Great, and Good: Yet all did shine As burnisht and as new As if before none ever did them view: They seem'd to me Environ'd with Eternity. As if from Everlasting they had there Been built, more gallant than if gilt With Gold, they shew'd: Nor did I know That they to Hands did ow Themselvs. Immortal they did all appear Till I knew Guilt. As if the Publick Good Of all the World for me had ever stood, They gratify'd Me, while the Earth they beautify'd. The living Peeple that mov'd up and down, With ruddy Cheeks and sparkling Eys; The Musick in the Churches, which Were Angels Joys (tho Pitch Defil'd me afterwards) as my chief crown I then did prize: These only I did lov As do the blessed Hosts in Heven abov: No other Pleasure Had I, nor wish'd for other Treasure. The Hevens were the richly studded Case Which did my richer Wealth inclose; No little privat Cabinet In which my Gems to set Did I contrive: I thought the whol Earth's face At my Dispose: No Confines did include What I possest, no Limits there I view'd; On evry side All endless was which then I spy'd. 'Tis Art that hath the late Invention found Of shutting up in little Room Ones Endless Expectations: Men Have in a narrow Penn Confin'd themselvs: Free Souls can know no Bound; But still presume That Treasures evry where From Everlasting Hills must still appear, And be to them Joys in the New Jerusalem. We first by Nature all things boundless see; Feel all illimited; and know No Terms or Periods: But go on Throughout the Endless Throne Of God, to view His wide Eternity; Ev'n here below His Omnipresence we Do pry into, that Copious Treasury. Tho men have taught To limit and to bound our Thought. Such Treasures as are to be valu'd more Than those shut up in Chests and Tills, Which are by Citizens exteem'd, To me the Peeple seem'd: The City doth encreas my glorious Store, Which sweetly fills With choice Variety The Place wherin I see the same to be; And strangely is A Mansion or Tower of Bliss. Nor can the City such a Soul as mine Confine; nor be my only Treasure: I must see other Things to be Of my Felicity Concurrent Instruments, and all combine To yeild me Pleasure. And God, to gratify This Inclination, helps me to descry Beyond the Sky More Wealth provided, and more high. Insatiableness. I. No Walls confine! Can nothing hold my Mind? Can I no Rest nor Satisfaction find? Must I behold Eternity And see What Things abov the Hev'ns be? Will nothing serv the Turn? Nor Earth, nor Seas, nor Skies? Till I what lies In Time's beginning find; Must I till then for ever burn? Not all the Crowns; not all the heaps of Gold On Earth; not all the Tales that can be told, Will Satisfaction yield to me: Nor Tree, Nor Shade, nor Sun, nor Eden, be A Joy: Nor Gems in Gold, (Be't Pearl or precious Stone,) Nor Spring, nor Flowers, Answer my Craving Powers, Nor any Thing that Eyes behold. Till I what was before all Time descry, The World's Beginning seems but Vanity. My Soul doth there long Thoughts extend No End Doth find, or Being comprehend: Yet somwhat sees that is The obscure shady face Of endless Space, All Room within; where I Expect to meet Eternal Bliss. II This busy, vast, enquiring Soul Brooks no Controul, No Limits will endure, Nor any Rest: It will all see, Not Time alone, but ev'n Eternity. What is it? Endless sure. 'Tis mean Ambition to define A single World: To many I aspire, Tho one upon another hurl'd: Nor will they all, if they be all confin'd, Delight my Mind. This busy, vast, enquiring Soul Brooks no Controul: 'Tis very curious too. Each one of all those Worlds must be Enricht with infinit Variety And Worth; or 'twill not do. 'Tis nor Delight nor perfect Pleasure To have a Purse That hath a Bottom in its Treasure, Since I must thence endless Expense disburse. Sure there's a GOD (for els there's no Delight) One Infinit. Consummation. The Thoughts of Men appear Freely to mov within a Sphere Of endless Reach; and run, Tho in the Soul, beyond the Sun. The Ground on which they acted be Is unobserv'd Infinity. Traversing throu the Sky, Tho here, beyond it far they fly: Abiding in the Mind An endless Liberty they find: Throu-out all Spaces can extend, Nor ever meet or know an End. They, in their native Sphere, At boundless Distances appear: Eternity can measure; Its no Beginning see with Pleasure. Thus in the Mind an endless Space Doth nat'rally display its face. Wherin becaus we no Object distinctly find or know; We sundry Things invent, That may our Fancy giv content; See Points of Space beyond the Sky, And in those Points see Creatures ly. Spy Fishes in the Seas, Conceit them swimming there with Eas; The Dolphins and the Whales, Their very Finns, their very Scales, As there within the briny Deep Their Tails the flowing Waters sweep. Can see the very Skies, As if the same were in our Eys; The Sun, tho in the Night, As if it mov'd within our Sight; One Space beyond another still Discovered; think while ye will. Which, tho we don't descry, (Much like by night an useless Ey, Not shaded with a Lid, But in a darksom Dungeon hid) At last shall in a glorious Day Be made its Objects to display And then shall Ages be Within its wide Eternity; All Kingdoms stand, Howe'r remote, yet nigh at hand; The Skies, and what beyond them ly, Exposed unto evry Ey. Nor shall we then invent Nor alter Things; but with content All in their places see, As doth the Glorious Deity; Within the Scope of whose Great Mind, We all in their tru Nature find. Hosanna. No more shall Walls, no more shall Walls confine That glorious Soul which in my Flesh doth shine: No more shall Walls of Clay or Mud Nor Ceilings made of Wood, Nor Crystal Windows, bound my Sight, But rather shall admit Delight. The Skies that seem to bound My Joys and Treasures, Of more endearing Pleasures Themselvs becom a Ground: While from the Center to the utmost Sphere My Goods are multiplied evry where. The Deity, the Deity to me Doth All things giv, and make me clearly see The Moon and Stars, the Air and Sun Into my Chamber com: The Seas and Rivers hither flow, Yea, here the Trees of Eden grow, The Fowls and Fishes stand, Kings and their Thrones, As 'twere, at my Command; God's Wealth, His Holy Ones, The Ages too, and Angels all conspire: While I, that I the Center am, admire. No more, No more shall Clouds eclyps my Treasures, Nor viler Shades obscure my highest Pleasures; No more shall earthen Husks confine My Blessings which do shine Within the Skies, or els abov: Both Worlds one Heven made by Lov, In common happy I With Angels walk And there my Joys espy; With God himself I talk; Wondring with Ravishment all Things to see Such Reall Joys, so truly Mine, to be. No more shall Trunks &amp; Dishes be my Store, Nor Ropes of Pearl, nor Chains of Golden Ore; As if such Beings yet were not, They all shall be forgot. No such in Eden did appear, No such in Heven: Heven here Would be, were those remov'd; The Sons of Men Liv in Jerusalem, Had they not Baubles lov'd. These Clouds dispers'd, the Hevens clear I see. Wealth new-invented, mine shall never be. Transcendent Objects doth my God provide, In such convenient Order all contriv'd, That All things in their proper place My Soul doth best embrace, Extends its Arms beyond the Seas, Abov the Hevens its self can pleas, With God enthron'd may reign: Like sprightly Streams My Thoughts on Things remain; Ev'n as som vital Beams They reach to, shine on, quicken Things, and make Them truly Usefull; while I All partake. For Me the World created was by Lov; For Me the Skies, the Seas, the Sun, do mov; The Earth for Me doth stable stand; For Me each fruitful Land For Me the very Angels God made His And my Companions in Bliss: His Laws command all Men That they lov Me, Under a Penalty Severe, in case they miss: His Laws require His Creatures all to prais His Name, and when they do't be most my Joys. The Review. I Did I grow, or did I stay? Did I prosper or decay? When I so From Things to Thoughts did go? Did I flourish or diminish, When I so in Thoughts did finish What I had in Things begun; When from God's Works to think upon The Thoughts of Men my Soul did com? The Thoughts of Men, had they been Wise, Should more delight me than the Skies. They mighty Creatures are For these the Mind Affect, afflict, do eas or grind; But foolish Thoughts ensnare. Wise ones are a sacred Treasure; Tru ones yield Substantial Pleasure: Compar'd to them, I Things as Shades esteem. False ones are a foolish Flourish, (Such as Mortals chiefly nourish) When I them to Things compare, Compar'd to Things, they Trifles are; Bad Thoughts do hurt, deceiv, ensnare. A good Man's Thoughts are of such price That they creäte a Paradise: But he that misemploys That Faculty, God, Men, and Angels doth defy; Robs them of all their Joys. II My Child-hood is a Sphere Wherin ten thousand hev'nly Joys appear: Those Thoughts it doth include, And those Affections, which review'd, Again present to me In better sort the Things that I did see. Imaginations Reall are, Unto my Mind again repair: Which makes my Life a Circle of Delights; A hidden Sphere of obvious Benefits: An Earnest that the Actions of the Just Shall still revive, and flourish in the Dust.

      <field name="fulltext">PART THREE POEMS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES §1. POEMS FROM CENTURIES OF MEDITATIONS. I [In Making Bodies Lov could not Express] In Making Bodies Lov could not Express It self, or Art; unless it made them less. O what a Monster had in Man been seen, Had evry Thumb or Toe a Mountain been! What Worlds must He devour when he did eat? What Oceans Drink! Yet could not all His Meat Or Stature, make Him like an Angel Shine; Or make His Soul in Glory more Divine. A Soul it is that makes us truly Great, Whose little Bodies make us more Compleat. An Understanding that is Infinit, An Endles, Wide, and Everlasting Sight, That can Enjoy all Things and nought exclude, Is the most Sacred Greatnes may be viewd. Twas inconvenient that His Bulk should be An Endless Hill; He nothing then could see: No figure hav, no Motion, Beauty, Place, No Color, feature, Member, Light, or Grace. A Body like a Mountain is but Cumber. An Endless Body is but idle Lumber. It Spoils Convers, and Time it self devours, While Meat in vain, in feeding idle Powers. Excessiv Bulk being most injurious found, To those Conveniences which Men hav Crownd. His Wisdom did His Power here repress, GOD made Man Greater while He made Him less. II [His Power Bounded, Greater is in Might] His Power Bounded, Greater is in Might, Then if let loos, twere wholy infinit. He could hav made an Endless Sea by this. But then it had not been a Sea of Bliss. Did Waters from the Centre to the Skies Ascend, twould drown whatever els we Prize The Ocean bounded in a finit Shore, Is better far becaus it is no more. No Use nor Glory would in that be Seen, His Power made it Endless in Esteem. Had not the Sun been bounded in its Sphere, Did all the World in one fair flame appear And were that flame a real Infinit Twould yeeld no Profit Splendor nor Delight. Its Corps confind, and Beams extended be Effects of Wisdom in the Dietie. One Star made infinit would all Exclude. An Earth made infinit could nere be viewd. But one being fashioned for the others sake, He bounding all, did all most usefull make: And which is best, in Profit and Delight Tho not in Bulk, they all are infinit. III On News. 1 News from a forrein Country came, As if my Treasure and my Wealth lay there: So much it did my Heart Enflame! Twas wont to call my Soul into mine Ear. Which thither went to Meet The Approaching Sweet: And on the Thresh hold stood, To entertain the Unknown Good. It Hoverd there As if twould leav mine Ear. And was so Eager to Embrace The Joyfull Tidings as they came, Twould almost leav its Dwelling Place, To Entertain the Same. 2 As if the Tidings were the Things, My very Joys them selvs, my forrein Treasure, Or els did bear them on their Wings; With so much Joy they came, with so much Pleasure. My Soul stood at the Gate To recreat It self with Bliss: And to Be pleasd with Speed. A fuller View It fain would take, Yet Journeys back would make Unto my Heart: as if twould fain Go out to meet, yet Stay within To fit a place, to Entertain, And bring the Tidings in. 3 What Sacred Instinct did inspire My Soul in Childhood with a Hope so Strong? What Secret Force movd my Desire, To Expect my Joys beyond the Seas, so Yong? Felicity I knew Was out of view: And being here alone, I saw that Happiness was gone From Me! for this, I Thirsted Absent Bliss, And thought that sure beyond the Seas, Or els in som thing near at hand I knew not yet, (since nought did pleas I knew:) my Bliss did stand. 4 But little did the Infant Dream That all the Treasures of the World were by: And that Himself was so the Cream And Crown of all, which round about did lie. Yet thus it was. The Gem, The Diadem, The Ring Enclosing all That Stood upon this Earthy Ball; The Heavenly Ey, Much Wider then the Skie, Wher in they all included were The Glorious Soul that was the King Made to possess them, did appear A Small and little thing! IV [A Life of Sabbaths here beneath!] 1 A Life of Sabbaths here beneath! Continual Jubilees and Joys! The Days of Heaven, while we breath On Earth! Where Sin all Bliss Destroys. This is a Triumph of Delights! That doth exceed all Appetites. No Joy can be Compard to this, It is a Life of Perfect Bliss. 2 Of Perfect Bliss! How can it be? To Conquer Satan, and to Reign In such a Vale of Miserie, Where Vipers, Stings and Tears remain; Is to be Crownd with Victorie. To be Content, Divine, and free Even here beneath is Great Delight And next the Beatifick Sight. 3 But inward Lusts do oft assail, Temptations Work us much Annoy. Weel therfore Weep, and to prevail Shall be a more Celestial Joy. To hav no other Enemie But one; and to that one to Die: To fight with that and Conquer it, Is better than in Peace to Sit. 4 Tis Better for a little time: For He that all His Lusts doth quell, Shall find this Life to be His Prime, And vanquish Sin and Conquer Hell. The Next shall be His Double Joy: And that which here seemd to Destroy, Shall in the Other Life appear A Root of Bliss; a Pearl each Tear. V [Sin!] 1 Sin! O only fatal Woe, That makst me Sad and Mourning go! That all my Joys dost Spoil, His Kingdom and my Soul Defile! I Never can Agree With Thee! 2 Thou! Only Thou! O Thou alone, And my obdurat Heart of Stone, The Poyson and the Foes Of My Enjoyments and Repose, The only Bitter Ill: Dost Kill! 3 Oh! I cannot meet with Thee, Nor once approach thy Memory, But all my Joys are Dead, And all my Sacred Treasures fled; As if I now did Dwell In Hell. 4 Lord! O hear how Short I Breath! See how I Tremble here beneath! A Sin! its Ugly face More Terror, then its Dwelling Place Contains, (O Dreadfull Sin) Within! VI The Recovery. Sin! wilt Thou vanquish me! And shall I yeeld the Victory? Shall all my Joys be Spoild, And Pleasures Soild By Thee! Shall I remain As one that's Slain And never more lift up the Head? Is not my Savior Dead! His Blood, thy Bane; my Balsam, Bliss, Joy, Wine; Shall Thee Destroy; Heal, Feed, make me Divine. VII [In Salem dwelt a Glorious King] 1 In Salem dwelt a Glorious King, Raisd from a Shepherds lowly State, That did his Praises like an Angel Sing Who did the World Create. By many great and Bloody Wars, He was Advanced unto Thrones: But more Delighted in the Stars, Then in the Splendor of His precious Stones. Nor Gold nor Silver did his Ey regard: The Works of GOD were his Sublime Reward. 2 A Warlike Champion he had been, And Many feats of Chivalrie Had don: in Kingly Courts his Ey had seen A Vast Variety Of Earthly Joys: Yet he despisd Those fading Honors and fals pleasures Which are by Mortals so much prizd; And placd his Happiness in other Treasures No State of Life which in this World we find Could yeeld Contentment to his greater Mind. 3 His fingars touchd his Trembling Lyre, And evry Quavering String did yeeld A Sound that filled all the Jewish Quire, And Ecchoed in the Field. No Pleasure was so Great to Him As in a Silent Night to See The Moon and Stars: A Cherubim Abov them even here He seemd to be. Enflamd with Lov, it was his great Desire, To Sing Contemplat Ponder and Admire. 4 He was a Prophet, and foresaw Things extant in the World to com: He was a Judg, and ruled by a Law That than the Hony Comb Was Sweeter far: He was a Sage, And all his people could Advise; An Oracle, whose evry Page Containd in vers the Greatest Mysteries But most He then Enjoyd Himself when he Did as a Poet prais the Dietie. 5 A Shepherd, Soldier, and Divine, A Judge, a Courtier, and a King, Priest, Angel, Prophet, Oracle, did shine At once; when He did Sing. Philosopher and Poet too Did in his Melodie appear; All these in Him did pleas the View Of Those that did his Heavenly Musick hear, And evry Drop that from his flowing Quill Came down, did all the World with Nectar fill. 6 He had a Deep and perfect Sence Of all the Glories and the Pleasures That in God's Works are hid, the Excellence Of such Transcendent Treasures Made him on Earth an Heavenly King, And fild his Solitudes with Joy; He never did more Sweetly Sing Then when alone, tho that doth Mirth destroy: Sence did his Soul with Heavenly Life inspire And made him seem in Gods Celestial Quire. 7 Rich Sacred Deep and Precious Things Did here on Earth the Man Surround With all the Glory of the King of Kings He was most Strangely Crownd. His Clear Soul and Open Sight Among the Sons of GOD did see Things filling Angels with Delight His Ear did hear their Heavenly Melodie And when He was alone He all became That Bliss implied, or did increase his Fame. 8 All Arts He then did Exercise And as his GOD he did Adore, By Secret Ravishments abov the Skies He carried was, before He died. His Soul did see and feel What others know not; and became While he before his GOD did kneel, A Constant Heavenly Pure Seraphick Flame. O that I might unto His Throne Aspire; And all His Joys abov the Stars Admire! § 2. POEMS FROM THE BOOK OF PRIVATE DEVOTIONS. I [Unto the Spring of Purest Life] 1 Unto the Spring of Purest Life Aspires my Withered Heart, My Soul confined in this Flesh Employs both Strength and Art Working, Strugling, Suing still, From Exile, home to part. 2 Who can utter the full Joy Which that High Place doth hold, Where all the Buildings founded are On Orient Pearls untold. And all the Work of those High rooms Doth Shine with Beams of Gold. 3 The Season is not Changd, but still Both Sun and Moon are Bright, The Lamb of this fair City is That Clear Immortal Light Whose Presence makes Eternal Day Which never Ends in Night. 4 Nay all the Saints them selvs shall Shine, As Bright as Brightest Sun; In fullest Triumph Crowned, They To Mutual Joys shall run: And safely count their Fights and Foes When once the War is don. 5 For being freed from all Defect, They feel no fleshly War; Or rather both the Flesh and Mind At length united are. For Joying in so Rich a Peace, They can admit no Jar: 6 Being Cheerfull, Clear, and Content, They from Mishaps are Free. No Sickness there can threaten Health, Nor Yong men Old can be. There they Enjoy such Happy State, That in't no Change they see. 7 Who Know the Knower of all Things, What can they chuse but Know? They all behold each others Hearts And all their Secrets Shew. One Act of Will, and of not Will, From all their Minds do flow. 8 Tho all their Merits Divers be According to their Pains, Yet LOV doth make that evry ones Which any other gains. And all which doth belong to One To all of them pertains. 9 O Happy Soul, which shalt behold This King still present there; And mayst from thence behold the World Run round, Secure from fear: With Stars and Planets, Moon and Sun, Still moving in their Sphere! 10 O King of Kings giv me such Strength In this Great War depending; That I may here prevail at length, And ever be Ascending. Till I at last Arrive to Thee The Source of all Felicity. II [Com Holy Ghost Eternal God] 1 Com Holy Ghost Eternal God Our Hearts with Life Inspire Inkindle Zeal in all our Souls And fill us with thy Heavenly fire. 2 Send forth thy Beams, and Let thy Grace Upon my Spirit shine: That I may all thy Works enjoy, Revive, Sing Praises, be Divine. III An Hymne upon St. Bartholomews Day. 1 What Powerfull Spirit livs within! What Active Angel doth inhabit here! What Heavenly Light inspires my Skin; Which doth so like a Dietie appear! A LIVING TEMPLE of all Ages I Within me see, A TEMPLE OF ETERNITIE! All Kingdoms I Descrie In Me. 2 An Inward Omnipresence here, Mysteriously like His with in me stands; Whose Knowledg is a Sacred Sphere, That in it self at once Includes all Lands. There is som ANGEL that within Me can Both Talk and Move And Walk and flie and See and love A Man on Earth, a Man Above. 3 Dull Walls of Clay my SPIRIT leavs And in a Forrein Kindom doth appear, This Great Apostle it receivs, Admires his Works and sees them, standing here. Within My Self from East to West I move, As if I were At once a CHERUBIM and Sphere, Or was at once abov, And here. 4 The Soul's a Messenger wherby Within our Inward Temple We may be Even like the very Dietie, In all the parts of His Eternitie. O liv within and leav unweildy Dross! Flesh is but Clay! O fly my Soul, and haste away To Jesus THRONE, or CROSS. Obey! § 3. POEMS FROM CHRISTIAN ETHICKS. I [For Man to Act as if his Soul did see] For Man to Act as if his Soul did see The very Brightness of Eternity; For Man to Act as if his Love did burn Above the Spheres, even while its in its Urne; For Man to Act even in the Wilderness, As if he did those Sovereign Joys possess, Which do at once confirm, stir up, enflame, And perfect Angels; having not the same! It doth increase the Value of his Deeds, In this a Man a Seraphim exceeds: To Act on Obligations yet unknown, To Act upon Rewards as yet unshewn, To keep Commands whose Beauty's yet unseen, To cherish and retain a Zeal between Sleeping and Waking; shews a constant care; And that a deeper Love, a Love so Rare, That no Eye Service may with it compare. The Angels, who are faithful while they view His Glory, know not what themselves would do, Were they in our Estate! A Dimmer Light Perhaps would make them erre as well as We; And in the Coldness of a darker Night, Forgetful and Lukewarm Themselves might be. Our very Rust shall cover us with Gold, Our Dust shall sprinkle ? Sparkle. while their Eyes behold The Glory Springing from a feeble State, Where meer Belief doth, if not conquer Fate, Surmount, and pass what it doth Antedate. II [All Musick, Sawces, Feasts, Delights and Pleasures] All Musick, Sawces, Feasts, Delights and Pleasures, Games, Dancing, Arts consist in govern'd Measures; Much more do Words, and Passions of the Mind In Temperance their sacred Beauty find. III [As in a Clock, 'tis hinder'd-Force doth bring] As in a Clock, 'tis hinder'd-Force doth bring The Wheels to order'd Motion, by a Spring; Which order'd Motion guides a steddy Hand In useful sort at Figures just to stand; Which, were it not by Counter-ballance staid, The Fabrick quickly would aside be laid As wholly useless: So a Might too Great, But well proportion'd, makes the World compleat. Power well-bounded is more Great in Might, Than if let loose 'twere wholly Infinite. He could have made an endless Sea by this, But then it had not been a Sea of Bliss; A Sea that's bounded in a finite shore, Is better far because it is no more. Should Waters endlessly exceed the Skies, They'd drown the World, and all whate'er we prize. Had the bright Sun been Infinite, its Flame Had burnt the World, and quite consum'd the same. That Flame would yield no splendor to the Sight, 'Twould be but Darkness though 'twere Infinite. One Star made Infinite would all exclude, An Earth made Infinite could ne're be view'd. But all being bounded for each others sake, He bounding all did all most useful make. And which is best, in Profit and Delight, Though not in Bulk, he made all Infinite. He in his Wisdom did their use extend, By all, to all the World from End to End. In all Things, all Things service do to all: And thus a Sand is Endless, though most small. And every Thing is truly Infinite, In its Relation deep and exquisite. IV [Were all the World a Paradice of Ease] Were all the World a Paradice of Ease 'Twere easie then to live in Peace. Were all men Wise, Divine, and Innocent, Just, Holy, Peaceful, and Content, Kind, Loving, True, and alwaies Good, As in the Golden-Age they stood; 'Twere easie then to live In all Delight and Glory, full of Love, Blest as the Angels are above. But we such Principles must now attain, (If we true Blessedness would gain) As those are, which will help to make us reign Over Disorders, Injuries, Ingratitudes, Calamities, Affronts, Oppressions, Slanders, Wrongs, Lies, Angers, bitter Tongues, The reach of Malice must surmount, and quell The very Rage, and Power of Hell. V [Mankind is sick, the World distemper'd lies] 1 Mankind is sick, the World distemper'd lies, Opprest with Sins and Miseries. Their Sins are Woes; a long corrupted Train Of Poyson, drawn from Adam's vein, Stains all his Seed, and all his Kin Are one Disease of Life within. They all torment themselves! The World's one Bedlam, or a greater Cave Of Mad-men, that do alwaies rave. 2 The Wise and Good like kind Physicians are, That strive to heal them by their Care. They Physick and their Learning calmly use, Although the Patient them abuse. For since the Sickness is (they find) A sad Distemper of the Mind; All railings they impute, All Injuries, unto the sore Disease, They are expresly come to ease! 3 If we would to the Worlds distemper'd Mind Impute the Rage which there we find, We might, even in the midst of all our Foes, Enjoy and feel a sweet Repose: Might pity all the Griefs we see, Anointing every Malady With precious Oyl and Balm; And while ourselves are Calm, our Art improve To rescue them, and shew our Love. 4 But let's not fondly our own selves beguile; If we Revile 'cause they Revile, Our selves infected with their sore Disease, Need others Helps to give us ease. For we more Mad then they remain, Need to be cut, and need a Chain Far more than they. Our Brain Is craz'd; and if we put our Wit to theirs, We may be justly made their Heirs. 5 But while with open eyes we clearly see The brightness of his Majesty; While all the World, by Sin to Satan sold, In daily Wickedness grows old, Men in Chains of Darkness lye, In Bondage and Iniquity, And pierce and grieve themselves! The dismal Woes wherein they crawl, enhance The Peace of our Inheritance. 6 We wonder to behold our selves so nigh To so much Sin and Misery, And yet to see our selves so safe from harm! What Amulet, what hidden Charm Could fortifie and raise the Soul So far above them; and controul Such fierce Malignity! The brightness and the glory which we see Is made a greater Mystery. 7 And while we feel how much our GOD doth love The Peace of Sinners, how much move, And sue, and thirst, intreat, lament and grieve, For all the Crimes in which they live, And seek and wait, and call again, And long to save them from the pain Of Sin, from all their Woe! With greater thirst, as well as grief we try, How to relieve their Misery. 8 The life and splendour of Felicity, Whose floods so overflowing be, The streams of Joy which round about his Throne, Enrich and fill each Holy One, Are so abundant, that we can Spare all, even all to any Man! And have it all our selves! Nay have the more! We long to make them see The sweetness of Felicity. 9 While we contemplate their Distresses, how, Blind Wretches, they in bondage bow, And tear and wound themselves, and vex and groan, And chafe and fret so near His Throne, And know not what they ail, but lye Tormented in their Misery (Like Mad-men that are blind) In works of darkness nigh such full Delight: That they might find and see the sight, 10 What would we give! that they might likewise see The Glory of his Majesty! The joy and fulness of that high delight, Whose Blessedness is infinite! We would even cease to live, to gain Them from their misery and pain, And make them with us reign. For they themselves would be our greatest Treasures When sav'd, our own most Heavenly Pleasures. 11 O holy JESUS who didst for us die, And on the Altar bleeding lie, Bearing all Torment, pain, reproach, and shame, That we by vertue of the same, Though enemies to God, might be Redeem'd, and set at liberty. As thou didst us forgive, So meekly let us Love to others shew, And live in Heaven on Earth below! 12 Let's prize their Souls, and let them be our Gems, Our Temples and our Diadems, Our Brides, our Friends, our fellow-Members, Eyes Hands, Hearts and Souls, our Victories, And Spoils and Trophies, our own Joyes! Compar'd to Souls all else are Toyes! O JESUS, let them be Such unto us, as they are unto thee, Vessels of Glory and Felicitie! 13 How will they love us, when they find our Care Brought them all thither where they are! When they conceive, what terrour 'tis to dwell In all the punishments of Hell: And in a lively manner see, O Christ, eternal Joyes in thee! How will they all delight In praising thee for us, with all their might, How sweet a Grace, how infinite! VI [Contentment is a sleepy thing!] Contentment is a sleepy thing! If it in Death alone must die; A quiet Mind is worse than Poverty! Unless it from Enjoyment spring! That's Blessedness alone that makes a King! Wherein the Joyes and Treasures are so great, They all the powers of the Soul employ, And fill it with a Work compleat, While it doth all enjoy. True Joyes alone Contentment do inspire, Enrich Content, and make our Courage higher. Content alone's a dead and silent Stone: The real life of Bliss Is Glory reigning in a Throne, Where all Enjoyment is. The Soul of Man is so inclin'd to see, Without his Treasures no man's Soul can be, Nor rest content Uncrown'd! Desire and Love Must in the height of all their Rapture move, Where there is true Felicity. Employment is the very life and ground Of Life it self; whose pleasant Motion is The form of Bliss: All Blessedness a life with Glory Crown'd. Life! Life is all: in its most full extent Stretcht out to all things, and with all Content! VII [And if the Glory and Esteem I have] And if the Glory and Esteem I have, Be nothing else than what my Silver gave; If for no other ground I am with Love or Praises crown'd, 'Tis such a shame, such vile, such base Repute 'Tis better starve, than eat such empty Fruit. § 4. POEMS FROM A SERIOUS AND PATHETICAL CONTEMPLATION OF THE MERCIES OF GOD. Thanksgivings for the Body.—I. While I, O Lord, exalted by thy hand, Above the Skies in Glory seem to stand: The Skies being made to serve me, as they do, While I thy Glories in thy Goodness view. To be in Glory higher than the Skies, Is greater bliss, than 'tis in place to rise Above the Stars: More blessed and divine, To live and see, than like the Sun to shine. O what Profoundness in my Body lies, For whom the Earth was made, the Sea, the Skies! So greatly high our humane Bodies are, That Angels scarcely may with these compare. In all the heights of Glory seated, they, Above the Sun in thine eternal day, Are seen to shine; with greater gifts adorn'd Than Gold with Light, or Flesh with Life suborn'd Suns are but Servants! Skies beneath their feet; The Stars but Stones; Moons but to serve them meet. Beyond all heights above the World they reign, In thy great Throne ordained to remain. All Tropes are Clouds; Truth doth it self excel, Whatever Heights, Hyperboles can tell. Thanksgivings for the Body.—II. Then shall each Limb a spring of Joy be found, And ev'ry Member with its Glory crown'd: While all the Senses, fill'd with all the Good That ever Ages in them understood, Transported are: Containing Worlds of Treasure, At one Delight with all their Joy and Pleasure. From whence, like Rivers, Joy shall overflow, Affect the Soul, though in the Body grow. Return again, and make the Body shine Like Jesus Christ, while both in one combine, Mysterious Contracts are between the Soul, Which touch the Spirits, and by those its Bowl: The Marrow, Bowels, Spirits, melt and move, Dissolving ravish, teach them how to love. He that could bring the Heavens thro the Eye, And make the World within the Fancy lie, By beams of Light that closing meet in one, From all the Parts of His celestial Throne, Far more than this in framing Bliss can do, Inflame the Body and the Spirit too: Can make the Soul by Sense to feel and see, And with her Joy the Senses wrap'd to be. Yea while the Flesh or Body subject lies To those Affections which in Souls arise; All holy Glories from the Soul redound, And in the Body by the Soul abound, Are felt within, and ravish ev'ry Sense, With all the Godhead's glorious Excellence: Who found the way himself to dwell within, As if even Flesh were nigh to him of kin. His Goodness, Wisdom, Power, Love divine, Make, by the Soul convey'd, the Body shine. Not like the Sun (that earthly Darkness is) But in the strengths and heights of all this bliss. For God designs thy Body, for his sake, A Temple of the Deity to make. Thanksgivings for the Beauty of his Providence. 1 These sweeter far than Lillies are, No Roses may with these compare! How these excel No Tongue can tell! Which he that well and truly knows, With praise and joy he goes. How great and happy's he, that knows his Ways, To be divine and heavenly Joys! To whom each City is more brave, Than Walls of Pearl, and Streets which Gold doth pave: Whose open eyes Behold the Skies; Who loves their Wealth and Beauty more, Than Kings love golden Ore! 2 Who sees the heavenly antient Ways, Of GOD the Lord, with Joy and Praise; More than the Skies, With open Eyes, Doth prize them all: yea more than Gems And Regal Diadems. That more esteemeth Mountains as they are, Than if they Gold and Silver were: To whom the SUN more pleasure brings, Than Crowns and Thrones, and Palaces, to Kings. That knows his Ways, To be the Joys, And Way of God. These things who knows, With Joy and Praise he goes! § 5. POEMS FROM MEDITATIONS ON THE SIX DAYS OF THE CREATION. First Day. Hail, sacred Light, which highly dost excel, And dost our Sorrows and our Fears dispel! When first appearing thou didst strike the Sight With darting Beams, all glorious fair and bright, And wondrous charming, Oh! how great and full Of sparkling Glory! Oh! how beautiful! How sweet thy Shine! How ravishing thy Rays! Proclaiming loud thy great Creator's Praise, When marvellously he had now decreed, That Day should Night, and Night should Day succeed; That this His Works and Wonders might display, And shadow forth his own eternal Day; Whilst that should temper the Day's increasing Drought, Moisten the Air, and make the Earth to sprout. He gave the Word, and Day did straight appear, Till Day at length declin'd, and Night drew near. Night, which hovering with her sable Wing, Doth Ease and Rest to wearied Mortals bring. Thus Nights and Days, and Days and Nights do fly, Returning in their Course successively; Each with its Comforts, though of diff'rent kinds, Both for our active and our drooping Minds. Since then both Day and Night such Blessings bring, By Day and Night let's bless our Lord and King, The King of all the World, in whom we move And live, and are, the mighty God above. Amen. Second Day. Hark how God's Word the Waters does command, That they forthwith obey, and parted stand! Two different ways, how does it them divide? Some upwards mount, and some again subside. In Vapours part ascend, the Clouds to fill, Part to refresh the Earth, in Rain distill. Mark how his Voice doth cut the Flames of Fire, What whist'ling Winds do blow, and then retire; How through the Air his pointed Arrows fly, And how his Thunder rattles in the Sky: He thunders, and the proudest Atheist quakes; From Heaven roars, and Hell's Foundation shakes. His Voice the Mountains and the Rocks doth rend, And tallest Cedars fall at his Command. Which yet to lowly Shrubs no Hurt will bring; These, and their humble Valleys, laugh and sing. Sing, O ye Valleys, whom the Lord doth crown; On you he drops his welcome Blessings down. When I perceive it rain in timely Showers, I see on you he fruitful Favours pours: But when from Clouds a watry Torrent spins, Methinks Heav'n weeps for our unwept-for Sins. And when on high I spy his beauteous Bow, By this he does his Truth and Mercy show. Oh that I could to him make some Return, And that I cannot do it better, mourn! Oh from these Eyes that Floods of Tears might fall! Tears for my Sins, which for them loudly call; And that my Thoughts, as Vapours, may arise, And mount to thee, my God, above the Skies; To own my Guilt, and Pardon supplicate, And never cease thy Praise to celebrate. Amen. Third Day. Lo here, within the Waters liquid Womb The unborn Earth lay, as in native Tomb; Whilst she at first was buried in the Deep, And all her Forms and Seeds were fast asleep. Th' Almighty Word then spake, and streight was heard, The Earth her Head up from the Waters rear'd. The Waters soon, as frighted, fled apace, And all were swiftly gather'd to one Place. See now the Earth, with Life and Verdure crown'd, Spring from her Bed, gay, vigorous, and sound: Her Face ten thousand Beauties now adorn, With Blessings numberless from Plenty's Horn. Here, there, and ev'ry where they richly flow, For us Almighty Bounty them does strow. The Hills and Dales, the Lawns and Woods around, God's Wisdom, Goodness, and his Pow'r resound. Both far and near his Wonders they proclaim. How vilely then is wretched Man to blame, If he forget to praise that liberal Hand, Out-spread from Sea to Sea, from Land to Land? Amen. Fourth Day. 1 Thou Lamp of God, and spacious World's vast Light, Of thee how shall I sing? of thee how write? For here I find the Danger is, With Bards of old, the Way to miss. Of thee a God, they strangely wond'ring made, And to thy Fire devoutly Homage paid. 2 The ancient Bards did see, and do, no more. But I a brighter Sun than thee adore. The Sun, I mean, that gave thee Light, A Sun ten thousand times more bright. Ah! who can thee sufficiently admire, O God, my Sun, or thee enough desire? 3 Hail, thou faint Image of th' Eternal Sun! Oh that with thee my Race I now could run! Oh that I could with thee obey! And oh that I did never stray! But with thee always keep within my Line, And with thee always in his Service join. 4 Thy influential Heat all Places warms, And every Creature feels thy living Charms. The Fields do laugh, the Woods do sing, The Hills do dance, the Valleys spring. The Fields and Groves, the Meads and Pastures live By Heat, which God to thee at first did give. 5 The Plants, and Birds, and Beasts do all conspire In this; and thee do eagerly Desire. Nothing we meet with here below, But what by thee doth live and grow. Oh! how thou dost with Youth and Vigour fill Thy Subject Earth, which Lifeless would be still! 6 Me with new Life from God thou dost inspire, That seeing thee I burn with rapt'rous Fire. Thou art the Glory of thy Lord: Thou art the Image of his Word: And I with thee now praise my LORD and thine, That he my Sun, may ever on me shine. Amen. Fifth Day. The Waters now are truly living made, But how is this? Th' Almighty Word has said; He said, Now let the Waters living be. Th' admiring Angels then did Wonders see. For streight the mighty Product of the Deep, As if awaken'd from their watry Sleep, Did now in numerous Shoals themselves display, And made appear a Fifth more glorious Day, Fairer than any that had gone before. Oh! who can God sufficiently adore, Who this Day gen'rated so rich a Store? A Day most fair! when his Almighty Skill Did all the Seas, and Lakes, and Rivers fill. Armies of Birds out of the Waters rise, And soaring mount towards the smiling Skies. Here skipping Fishes cut the lambent Air, There living Castles mighty things declare; And swiftly rolling through the spacious Main, This Day proclaim, with all their finny Train. O let not Man forget with these to raise Both Heart and Voice to his great Maker's Praise. Amen. Sixth Day. 1 When first the teeming Waters had brought forth Their Births, from East to West, from South to North, Fish fill'd the Sea, and Fowls the Air, The Earth alone remaining bare. For though it had been furnish'd out so well, Yet no Inhabitant on Earth did dwell. 2 The Earth was all throughout as Eden fair; How fine, how goodly were the Plants she bare? But yet no Animal was seen, Nothing with Sense on Earth had been. Till now th' Almighty did from Heaven look, And into Being living Forms bespoke. 3 The pregnant Earth a second time did bear, Not Herbs, nor Shrubs, nor Trees did now appear, As at the first, from her to spring; But nobler Births did to her cling. With Life and Sense endu'd, these from her came, Compleatly good, and naught in them to blame. 4 The harmless Lion with the Lamb did play, And Leopards on the Sheep did never prey: There nothing was that did destroy: There nothing was that did annoy: But all was love, and perfect Harmony; All did the Maker's Goodness testify. 5 But still the Heir was wanted to appear, Till God at length was pleased to draw near: And as the Earth his Feet did touch, The blooming Earth did streightway blush; Her Dust a lovely red did richly die: No Tyrian Stain could with it ever vie. 6 And from this ruddy Earth there did arise A beauteous Form, such as no mortal Eyes Have ever yet on Earth beheld, Since hither we have been expell'd, From Eden's glorious East, with Beasts to dwell In this vile World, which Sin has made an Hell. 7 The Beasts and Birds did all admiring stand, So fair a Shape to view, which God's own Hand Had just produc'd with Art divine, In which all Beauties did combine. And, lo! a rushing Breath from Heaven came, Which kindled presently the vital Flame. 8 The noble Godlike Form was then proclaimed The King of Earth, and God's Vicegerent nam'd. His Subjects him did recognise, Whose Glory did them all surprise. It was God's Glory which on him did rest, And with majestick Awe did him invest. 9 Whilst infinitely greater Majesty, And Awe, and Dread, and justest Sov'reignty, In his Creator does appear; Enough to challenge ev'ry where The utmost Duty Angels or Men can pay, The strictest Service, and without Delay. 10 For shame then, O my guilty Soul, begin To weep, lament, and wash away thy Sin. Begin before it be too late; Beg Pardon for thy Faults so great; Repent, amend thy Life, amend thy Ways, He's blest that his Creator's Will obeys. 11 And since to please thee nothing I can do Without thy Grace, thy Grace do thou bestow, O God, that furnish'd I may be With sufficient Strength from thee, To conquer all Temptations that arise To whatsoever sort of Sin, or Vice. 12 That thankful, holy, happy I may be, May please thee here, and to Eternity May bless thee with a cheerful Voice, And with the Saints, who all rejoice To warble forth thy Praises, may Enjoy thee in an everlasting Day. Amen.</field>
