      <field name="fulltext">PRINCIPAL POEMS THE BLESSED DAMOZEL The blessed damozel leaned out From the gold bar of Heaven; Her eyes were deeper than the depth Of waters stilled at even; She had three lilies in her hand, And the stars in her hair were seven. Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem, No wrought flowers did adorn, But a white rose of Mary's gift, For service meetly worn; Her hair that lay along her back Was yellow like ripe corn. Herseemed she scarce had been a day One of God's choristers; The wonder was not yet quite gone From that still look of hers; Albeit, to them she left, her day Had counted as ten years. (To one, it is ten years of years. ...Yet now, and in this place, Surely she leaned o'er me—her hair Fell all about my face... Nothing: the autumn-fall of leaves. The whole year sets apace.) It was the rampart of God's house That she was standing on; By God built over the sheer depth The which is Space begun; So high, that looking downward thence She scarce could see the sun. It lies in Heaven, across the flood Of ether, as a bridge. Beneath, the tides of day and night With flame and darkness ridge The void, as low as where this earth Spins like a fretful midge. Around her, lovers, newly met 'Mid deathless love's acclaims, Spoke evermore among themselves Their heart-remembered names; And the souls mounting up to God Went by her like thin flames. And still she bowed herself and stooped Out of the circling charm; Until her bosom must have made The bar she leaned on warm, And the lilies lay as if asleep Along her bended arm. From the fixed place of Heaven she saw Time like a pulse shake fierce Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove Within the gulf to pierce Its path; and now she spoke as when The stars sang in their spheres. The sun was gone now; the curled moon Was like a little feather Fluttering far down the gulf; and now She spoke through the still weather. Her voice was like the voice the stars Had when they sang together. (Ah sweet! Even now, in that bird's song, Strove not her accents there, Fain to be hearkened? When those bells Possessed the mid-day air, Strove not her steps to reach my side Down all the echoing stair?) “I wish that he were come to me, For he will come,” she said. “Have I not prayed in Heaven?—on earth, Lord, Lord, has he not pray'd? Are not two prayers a perfect strength? And shall I feel afraid? “When round his head the aureole clings, And he is clothed in white, I'll take his hand and go with him To the deep wells of light; As unto a stream we will step down, And bathe there in God's sight. “We two will stand beside that shrine, Occult, withheld, untrod, Whose lamps are stirred continually With prayer sent up to God; And see our old prayers, granted, melt Each like a little cloud. “We two will lie i' the shadow of That living mystic tree Within whose secret growth the Dove Is sometimes felt to be, While every leaf that His plumes touch Saith His Name audibly. “And I myself will teach to him, I myself, lying so, The songs I sing here; which his voice Shall pause in, hushed and slow, And find some knowledge at each pause, Or some new thing to know.” (Alas! we two, we two, thou say'st! Yea, one wast thou with me That once of old. But shall God lift To endless unity The soul whose likeness with thy soul Was but its love for thee?) “We two,” she said, “will seek the groves Where the lady Mary is, With her five handmaidens, whose names Are five sweet symphonies, Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen, Margaret and Rosalys. “Circlewise sit they, with bound locks And foreheads garlanded; Into the fine cloth white like flame Weaving the golden thread, To fashion the birth-robes for them Who are just born, being dead. “He shall fear, haply, and be dumb: Then will I lay my cheek To his, and tell about our love, Not once abashed or weak: And the dear Mother will approve My pride, and let me speak. “Herself shall bring us, hand in hand, To Him round whom all souls Kneel, the clear-ranged unnumbered heads Bowed with their aureoles: And angels meeting us shall sing To their citherns and citoles. “There will I ask of Christ the Lord Thus much for him and me:— Only to live as once on earth With Love,—only to be, “As then awhile, for ever now Together, I and he.” She gazed and listened and then said, Less sad of speech than mild,— “All this is when he comes.” She ceased. The light thrilled towards her, fill'd With angels in strong level flight. Her eyes prayed, and she smil'd. (I saw her smile.) But soon their path Was vague in distant spheres: And then she cast her arms along The golden barriers, And laid her face between her hands, And wept. (I heard her tears.) DANTE AT VERONA Yea, thou shalt learn how salt his food who fares Upon another's bread,—how steep his path Who treadeth up and down another's stairs. (Div. Com. Parad. xvii.) Behold, even I, even I am Beatrice. (Div. Com. Purg. xxx.) Of Florence and of Beatrice Servant and singer from of old, O'er Dante's heart in youth had toll'd The knell that gave his Lady peace; And now in manhood flew the dart Wherewith his City pierced his heart. Yet if his Lady's home above Was Heaven, on earth she filled his soul; And if his City held control To cast the body forth to rove, The soul could soar from earth's vain throng, And Heaven and Hell fulfil the song. Follow his feet's appointed way;— But little light we find that clears The darkness of the exiled years. Follow his spirit's journey:—nay, What fires are blent, what winds are blown On paths his feet may tread alone? Yet of the twofold life he led In chainless thought and fettered will Some glimpses reach us,—somewhat still Of the steep stairs and bitter bread,— Of the soul's quest whose stern avow For years had made him haggard now. Alas! the Sacred Song whereto Both heaven and earth had set their hand Not only at Fame's gate did stand Knocking to claim the passage through, But toiled to ope that heavier door Which Florence shut for evermore. Shall not his birth's baptismal Town One last high presage yet fulfil, And at that font in Florence still His forehead take the laurel-crown? O God! or shall dead souls deny The undying soul its prophecy? Aye, 'tis their hour. Not yet forgot The bitter words he spoke that day When for some great charge far away Her rulers his acceptance sought. “And if I go, who stays?”—so rose His scorn:—“and if I stay, who goes?” “Lo! thou art gone now, and we stay” (The curled lips mutter): “and no star Is from thy mortal path so far As streets where childhood knew the way. To Heaven and Hell thy feet may win, But thine own house they come not in.” Therefore, the loftier rose the song To touch the secret things of God, The deeper pierced the hate that trod On base men's track who wrought the wrong; Till the soul's effluence came to be Its own exceeding agony. Arriving only to depart, From court to court, from land to land, Like flame within the naked hand His body bore his burning heart That still on Florence strove to bring God's fire for a burnt offering. Even such was Dante's mood, when now, Mocked for long years with Fortune's sport, He dwelt at yet another court, There where Verona's knee did bow And her voice hailed with all acclaim Can Grande della Scala's name. As that lord's kingly guest awhile His life we follow; through the days Which walked in exile's barren ways,— The nights which still beneath one smile Heard through all spheres one song increase,— “Even I, even I am Beatrice.” At Can La Scala's court, no doubt, Due reverence did his steps attend; The ushers on his path would bend At ingoing as at going out; The penmen waited on his call At council-board, the grooms in hall. And pages hushed their laughter down, And gay squires stilled the merry stir, When he passed up the dais-chamber With set brows lordlier than a frown; And tire-maids hidden among these Drew close their loosened bodices. Perhaps the priests, (exact to span All God's circumference,) if at whiles They found him wandering in their aisles, Grudged ghostly greeting to the man By whom, though not of ghostly guild, With Heaven and Hell men's hearts were fill'd. And the court-poets (he, forsooth, A whole world's poet strayed to court!) Had for his scorn their hate's retort. He'd meet them flushed with easy youth, Hot on their errands. Like noon-flies They vexed him in the ears and eyes. But at this court, peace still must wrench Her chaplet from the teeth of war: By day they held high watch afar, At night they cried across the trench; And still, in Dante's path, the fierce Gaunt soldiers wrangled o'er their spears. But vain seemed all the strength to him, As golden convoys sunk at sea Whose wealth might root out penury: Because it was not, limb with limb, Knit like his heart-strings round the wall Of Florence, that ill pride might fall. Yet in the tiltyard, when the dust Cleared from the sundered press of knights Ere yet again it swoops and smites, He almost deemed his longing must Find force to wield that multitude And hurl that strength the way he would. How should he move them,—fame and gain On all hands calling them at strife? He still might find but his one life To give, by Florence counted vain; One heart the false hearts made her doubt, One voice she heard once and cast out. Oh! if his Florence could but come, A lily-sceptred damsel fair, As her own Giotto painted her On many shields and gates at home,— A lady crowned, at a soft pace Riding the lists round to the dais: Till where Can Grande rules the lists, As young as Truth, as calm as Force, She draws her rein now, while her horse Bows at the turn of the white wrists; And when each knight within his stall Gives ear, she speaks and tells them all: All the foul tale,—truth sworn untrue And falsehood's triumph. All the tale? Great God! and must she not prevail To fire them ere they heard it through,— And hand achieve ere heart could rest That high adventure of her quest? How would his Florence lead them forth, Her bridle ringing as she went; And at the last within her tent, 'Neath golden lilies worship-worth, How queenly would she bend the while And thank the victors with her smile! Also her lips should turn his way And murmur: “O thou tried and true, With whom I wept the long years through! What shall it profit if I say, Thee I remember? Nay, through thee All ages shall remember me.” Peace, Dante, peace! The task is long, The time wears short to compass it. Within thine heart such hopes may flit And find a voice in deathless song: But lo! as children of man's earth, Those hopes are dead before their birth. Fame tells us that Verona's court Was a fair place. The feet might still Wander for ever at their will In many ways of sweet resort; And still in many a heart around The Poet's name due honour found. Watch we his steps. He comes upon The women at their palm-playing. The conduits round the gardens sing And meet in scoops of milk-white stone, Where wearied damsels rest and hold Their hands in the wet spurt of gold. One of whom, knowing well that he, By some found stern, was mild with them, Would run and pluck his garment's hem, Saying, “Messer Dante, pardon me,”— Praying that they might hear the song Which first of all he made, when young. “Donne che avete” Donne che avete intelletto d'amore:—the first canzone of the Vita Nuova. ...Thereunto Thus would he murmur, having first Drawn near the fountain, while she nurs'd His hand against her side: a few Sweet words, and scarcely those, half said: Then turned, and changed, and bowed his head. For then the voice said in his heart, “Even I, even I am Beatrice”; And his whole life would yearn to cease: Till having reached his room, apart Beyond vast lengths of palace-floor, He drew the arras round his door. At such times, Dante, thou hast set Thy forehead to the painted pane Full oft, I know; and if the rain Smote it outside, her fingers met Thy brow; and if the sun fell there, Her breath was on thy face and hair. Then, weeping, I think certainly Thou hast beheld, past sight of eyne,— Within another room of thine Where now thy body may not be But where in thought thou still remain'st,— A window often wept against: The window thou, a youth, hast sought, Flushed in the limpid eventime, Ending with daylight the day's rhyme Of her; where oftenwhiles her thought Held thee—the lamp untrimmed to write— In joy through the blue lapse of night. At Can La Scala's court, no doubt, Guests seldom wept. It was brave sport, No doubt, at Can La Scala's Court, Within the palace and without; Where music, set to madrigals, Loitered all day through groves and halls. Because Can Grande of his life Had not had six-and-twenty years As yet. And when the chroniclers Tell you of that Vicenza strife And of strifes elsewhere,—you must not Conceive for church-sooth he had got Just nothing in his wits but war: Though doubtless 'twas the young man's joy (Grown with his growth from a mere boy,) To mark his “Viva Cane!” scare The foe's shut front, till it would reel All blind with shaken points of steel. But there were places—held too sweet For eyes that had not the due veil Of lashes and clear lids—as well In favour as his saddle-seat: Breath of low speech he scorned not there Nor light cool fingers in his hair. Yet if the child whom the sire's plan Made free of a deep treasure-chest Scoffed it with ill-conditioned jest,— We may be sure too that the man Was not mere thews, nor all content With lewdness swathed in sentiment. So you may read and marvel not That such a man as Dante—one Who, while Can Grande's deeds were done, Had drawn his robe round him and thought— Now at the same guest-table far'd Where keen Uguccio wiped his beard. Uguccione della Faggiuola, Dante's former protector, was now his fellow-guest at Verona. Through leaves and trellis-work the sun Left the wine cool within the glass,— They feasting where no sun could pass: And when the women, all as one, Rose up with brightened cheeks to go, It was a comely thing, we know. But Dante recked not of the wine; Whether the women stayed or went, His visage held one stern intent: And when the music had its sign To breathe upon them for more ease, Sometimes he turned and bade it cease. And as he spared not to rebuke The mirth, so oft in council he To bitter truth bore testimony: And when the crafty balance shook Well poised to make the wrong prevail, Then Dante's hand would turn the scale. And if some envoy from afar Sailed to Verona's sovereign port For aid or peace, and all the court Fawned on its lord, “the Mars of war, Sole arbiter of life and death,”— Be sure that Dante saved his breath. And Can La Scala marked askance These things, accepting them for shame And scorn, till Dante's guestship came To be a peevish sufferance: His host sought ways to make his days Hateful; and such have many ways. There was a Jester, a foul lout Whom the court loved for graceless arts; Sworn scholiast of the bestial parts Of speech; a ribald mouth to shout In Folly's horny tympanum Such things as make the wise man dumb. Much loved, him Dante loathed. And so, One day when Dante felt perplexed If any day that could come next Were worth the waiting for or no, And mute he sat amid their din,— Can Grande called the Jester in. Rank words, with such, are wit's best wealth. Lords mouthed approval; ladies kept Twittering with clustered heads, except Some few that took their trains by stealth And went. Can Grande shook his hair And smote his thighs and laughed i' the air. Then, facing on his guest, he cried,— “Say, Messer Dante, how it is I get out of a clown like this More than your wisdom can provide.” And Dante: “'Tis man's ancient whim That still his like seems good to him.” Also a tale is told, how once, At clearing tables after meat, Piled for a jest at Dante's feet Were found the dinner's well-picked bones; So laid, to please the banquet's lord, By one who crouched beneath the board. Then smiled Can Grande to the rest:— “Our Dante's tuneful mouth indeed Lacks not the gift on flesh to feed!” “Fair host of mine,” replied the guest, “So many bones you'd not descry If so it chanced the dog were I.” “Messere, voi non vedreste tant 'ossa se cane io fossi.” The point of the reproach is difficult to render, depending as it does on the literal meaning of the name Cane. But wherefore should we turn the grout In a drained cup, or be at strife From the worn garment of a life To rip the twisted ravel out? Good needs expounding; but of ill Each hath enough to guess his fill. They named him Justicer-at-Law: Each month to bear the tale in mind Of hues a wench might wear unfin'd And of the load an ox might draw; To cavil in the weight of bread And to see purse-thieves gibbeted. And when his spirit wove the spell (From under even to over-noon In converse with itself alone,) As high as Heaven, as low as Hell,— He would be summoned and must go: For had not Gian stabbed Giacomo? Therefore the bread he had to eat Seemed brackish, less like corn than tares; And the rush-strown accustomed stairs Each day were steeper to his feet; And when the night-vigil was done, His brows would ache to feel the sun. Nevertheless, when from his kin There came the tidings how at last In Florence a decree was pass'd Whereby all banished folk might win Free pardon, so a fine were paid And act of public penance made,— This Dante writ in answer thus, Words such as these: “That clearly they In Florence must not have to say,— The man abode aloof from us Nigh fifteen years, yet lastly skulk'd Hither to candleshrift and mulct. “That he was one the Heavens forbid To traffic in God's justice sold By market-weight of earthly gold, Or to bow down over the lid Of steaming censers, and so be Made clean of manhood's obloquy. “That since no gate led, by God's will, To Florence, but the one whereat The priests and money-changers sat, He still would wander; for that still, Even through the body's prison-bars, His soul possessed the sun and stars.” Such were his words. It is indeed For ever well our singers should Utter good words and know them good Not through song only; with close heed Lest, having spent for the work's sake Six days, the man be left to make. Months o'er Verona, till the feast Was come for Florence the Free Town: And at the shrine of Baptist John The exiles, girt with many a priest And carrying candles as they went, Were held to mercy of the saint. On the high seats in sober state,— Gold neck-chains range o'er range below Gold screen-work where the lilies grow,— The Heads of the Republic sate, Marking the humbled face go by Each one of his house-enemy. And as each proscript rose and stood From kneeling in the ashen dust On the shrine-steps, some magnate thrust A beard into the velvet hood Of his front colleague's gown, to see The cinders stuck in the bare knee. Tosinghi passed, Manelli passed, Rinucci passed, each in his place; But not an Alighieri's face Went by that day from first to last In the Republic's triumph; nor A foot came home to Dante's door. (Respublica—a public thing: A shameful shameless prostitute, Whose lust with one lord may not suit, So takes by turn its revelling A night with each, till each at morn Is stripped and beaten forth forlorn, And leaves her, cursing her. If she, Indeed, have not some spice-draught, hid In scent under a silver lid, To drench his open throat with—he Once hard asleep; and thrust him not At dawn beneath the stairs to rot. Such this Republic!—not the Maid He yearned for; she who yet should stand With Heaven's accepted hand in hand, Invulnerable and unbetray'd: To whom, even as to God, should be Obeisance one with Liberty.) Years filled out their twelve moons, and ceased One in another; and alway There were the whole twelve hours each day And each night as the years increased; And rising moon and setting sun Beheld that Dante's work was done. What of his work for Florence? Well It was, he knew, and well must be. Yet evermore her hate's decree Dwelt in his thought intolerable:— His body to be burned, Such was the last sentence passed by Florence against Dante, as a recalcitrant exile.—his soul To beat its wings at hope's vain goal. What of his work for Beatrice? Now well-nigh was the third song writ,— The stars a third time sealing it With sudden music of pure peace: For echoing thrice the threefold song, The unnumbered stars the tone prolong. E quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle. —Inferno. Puro e disposto a salire alle stelle. —Purgatorio. L'amor che muove il sole e l'altre stelle. —Paradiso. Each hour, as then the Vision pass'd, He heard the utter harmony Of the nine trembling spheres, till she Bowed her eyes towards him in the last, So that all ended with her eyes, Hell, Purgatory, Paradise. “It is my trust, as the years fall, To write more worthily of her Who now, being made God's minister, Looks on His visage and knows all.” Such was the hope that love dar'd blend With grief's slow fires, to make an end Of the “New Life,” his youth's dear book: Adding thereunto: “In such trust I labour, and believe I must Accomplish this which my soul took In charge, if God, my Lord and hers, Leave my life with me a few years.” The trust which he had borne in youth Was all at length accomplished. He At length had written worthily— Yea even of her; no rhymes uncouth 'Twixt tongue and tongue; but by God's aid The first words Italy had said. Ah! haply now the heavenly guide Was not the last form seen by him: But there that Beatrice stood slim And bowed in passing at his side, For whom in youth his heart made moan Then when the city sat alone. Quomodo sedet sola civitas!—The words quoted by Dante in the Vita Nuova when he speaks of the death of Beatrice. Clearly herself: the same whom he Met, not past girlhood, in the street, Low-bosomed and with hidden feet; And then as woman perfectly, In years that followed, many an once,— And now at last among the suns In that high vision. But indeed It may be memory might recall Last to him then the first of all,— The child his boyhood bore in heed Nine years. At length the voice brought peace,— “Even I, even I am Beatrice.” All this, being there, we had not seen. Seen only was the shadow wrought On the strong features bound in thought; The vagueness gaining gait and mien; The white streaks gathering clear to view In the burnt beard the women knew. For a tale tells that on his track, As through Verona's streets he went, This saying certain women sent:— “Lo, he that strolls to Hell and back At will! Behold him, how Hell's reek Has crisped his beard and singed his cheek.” “Whereat” (Boccaccio's words) “he smiled For pride in fame.” It might be so: Nevertheless we cannot know If haply he were not beguiled To bitterer mirth, who scarce could tell If he indeed were back from Hell. So the day came, after a space, When Dante felt assured that there The sunshine must lie sicklier Even than in any other place, Save only Florence. When that day Had come, he rose and went his way. He went and turned not. From his shoes It may be that he shook the dust, As every righteous dealer must Once and again ere life can close: And unaccomplished destiny Struck cold his forehead, it may be. No book keeps record how the Prince Sunned himself out of Dante's reach, Nor how the Jester stank in speech: While courtiers, used to cringe and wince, Poets and harlots, all the throng, Let loose their scandal and their song. No book keeps record if the seat Which Dante held at his host's board Were sat in next by clerk or lord,— If leman lolled with dainty feet At ease, or hostage brooded there, Or priest lacked silence for his prayer. Eat and wash hands, Can Grande;—scarce We know their deeds now: hands which fed Our Dante with that bitter bread; And thou the watch-dog of those stairs Which, of all paths his feet knew well, Were steeper found than Heaven or Hell. THE BRIDE'S PRELUDE “Sister,” said busy Amelotte To listless Aloÿse; “Along your wedding-road the wheat Bends as to hear your horse's feet, And the noonday stands still for heat.” Amelotte laughed into the air With eyes that sought the sun: But where the walls in long brocade Were screened, as one who is afraid Sat Aloÿse within the shade. And even in shade was gleam enough To shut out full repose From the bride's 'tiring-chamber, which Was like the inner altar-niche Whose dimness worship has made rich. Within the window's heaped recess The light was counterchanged In blent reflexes manifold From perfume-caskets of wrought gold And gems the bride's hair could not hold, All thrust together: and with these A slim-curved lute, which now, At Amelotte's sudden passing there, Was swept in somewise unaware, And shook to music the close air. Against the haloed lattice-panes The bridesmaid sunned her breast; Then to the glass turned tall and free, And braced and shifted daintily Her loin-belt through her côte-hardie. The belt was silver, and the clasp Of lozenged arm-bearings; A world of mirrored tints minute The rippling sunshine wrought into 't, That flushed her hand and warmed her foot. At least an hour had Aloÿse— Her jewels in her hair— Her white gown, as became a bride, Quartered in silver at each side— Sat thus aloof, as if to hide. Over her bosom, that lay still, The vest was rich in grain, With close pearls wholly overset: Around her throat the fastenings met Of chevesayle and mantelet. Her arms were laid along her lap With the hands open: life Itself did seem at fault in her: Beneath the drooping brows, the stir Of thought made noonday heavier. Long sat she silent; and then raised Her head, with such a gasp As while she summoned breath to speak Fanned high that furnace in the cheek But sucked the heart-pulse cold and weak. (Oh gather round her now, all ye Past seasons of her fear,— Sick springs, and summers deadly cold! To flight your hovering wings unfold, For now your secret shall be told. Ye many sunlights, barbed with darts Of dread detecting flame,— Gaunt moonlights that like sentinels Went past with iron clank of bells,— Draw round and render up your spells!) “Sister,” said Aloÿse, “I had A thing to tell thee of Long since, and could not. But do thou Kneel first in prayer awhile, and bow Thine heart, and I will tell thee now.” Amelotte wondered with her eyes; But her heart said in her: “Dear Aloÿse would have me pray Because the awe she feels to-day Must need more prayers than she can say.” So Amellotte put by the folds That covered up her feet, And knelt,—beyond the arras'd gloom And the hot window's dull perfume,— Where day was stillest in the room. “Queen Mary, hear,” she said, “and say To Jesus the Lord Christ, This bride's new joy, which He confers, New joy to many ministers, And many griefs are bound in hers.” The bride turned in her chair, and hid Her face against the back, And took her pearl-girt elbows in Her hands, and could not yet begin, But shuddering, uttered, “Urscelyn!” Most weak she was; for as she pressed Her hand against her throat, Along the arras she let trail Her face, as if all heart did fail, And sat with shut eyes, dumb and pale. Amelotte still was on her knees As she had kneeled to pray. Deeming her sister swooned, she thought, At first, some succour to have brought; But Aloÿse rocked, as one distraught. She would have pushed the lattice wide To gain what breeze might be; But marking that no leaf once beat The outside casement, it seemed meet Not to bring in more scent and heat. So she said only: “Aloÿse, Sister, when happened it At any time that the bride came To ill, or spoke in fear of shame, When speaking first the bridegroom's name?” A bird had out its song and ceased Ere the bride spoke. At length She said: “The name is as the thing:— Sin hath no second christening, And shame is all that shame can bring. “In divers places many an while I would have told thee this; But faintness took me, or a fit Like fever. God would not permit That I should change thine eyes with it. “Yet once I spoke, hadst thou but heard:— That time we wandered out All the sun's hours, but missed our way When evening darkened, and so lay The whole night covered up in hay. “At last my face was hidden: so, Having God's hint, I paused Not long; but drew myself more near Where thou wast laid, and shook off fear, And whispered quick into thine ear “Something of the whole tale. At first I lay and bit my hair For the sore silence thou didst keep: Till, as thy breath came long and deep, I knew that thou hadst been asleep. “The moon was covered, but the stars Lasted till morning broke. Awake, thou told'st me that thy dream Had been of me,—that all did seem At jar,—but that it was a dream. “I knew God's hand and might not speak. After that night I kept Silence and let the record swell: Till now there is much more to tell Which must be told out ill or well.” She paused then, weary, with dry lips Apart. From the outside By fits there boomed a dull report From where i' the hanging tennis-court The bridegroom's retinue made sport. The room lay still in dusty glare, Having no sound through it Except the chirp of a caged bird That came and ceased: and if she stirred, Amelotte's raiment could be heard. Quoth Amelotte: “The night this chanced Was a late summer night Last year! What secret, for Christ's love, Keep'st thou since then? Mary above! What thing is this thou speakest of? “Mary and Christ! Lest when 'tis told I should be prone to wrath,— This prayer beforehand! How she errs Soe'er, take count of grief like hers, Whereof the days are turned to years!” She bowed her neck, and having said, Kept on her knees to hear; And then, because strained thought demands Quiet before it understands, Darkened her eyesight with her hands. So when at last her sister spoke, She did not see the pain O' the mouth nor the ashamèd eyes, But marked the breath that came in sighs And the half-pausing for replies. This was the bride's sad prelude-strain:— “I' the convent where a girl I dwelt till near my womanhood, I had but preachings of the rood And Aves told in solitude “To spend my heart on: and my hand Had but the weary skill To eke out upon silken cloth Christ's visage, or the long bright growth Of Mary's hair, or Satan wroth. “So when at last I went, and thou, A child not known before, Didst come to take the place I left,— My limbs, after such lifelong theft Of life, could be but little deft “In all that ministers delight To noble women: I Had learned no word of youth's discourse, Nor gazed on games of warriors, Nor trained a hound, nor ruled a horse. “Besides, the daily life i' the sun Made me at first hold back. To thee this came at once; to me It crept with pauses timidly; I am not blithe and strong like thee. “Yet my feet liked the dances well, The songs went to my voice, The music made me shake and weep; And often, all night long, my sleep Gave dreams I had been fain to keep. “But though I loved not holy things, To hear them scorned brought pain,— They were my childhood; and these dames Were merely perjured in saints' names And fixed upon saints' days for games. “And sometimes when my father rode To hunt with his loud friends, I dared not bring him to be quaff'd, As my wont was, his stirrup-draught, Because they jested so and laughed. “At last one day my brothers said, The girl must not grow thus,— Bring her a jennet,—she shall ride.’ They helped my mounting, and I tried To laugh with them and keep their side, “But brakes were rough and bents were steep Upon our path that day: My palfrey threw me; and I went Upon men's shoulders home, sore spent, While the chase followed up the scent. “Our shrift-father (and he alone Of all the household there Had skill in leechcraft) was away When I reached home. I tossed, and lay Sullen with anguish the whole day. “For the day passed ere some one brought To mind that in the hunt Rode a young lord she named, long bred Among the priests, whose art (she said) Might chance to stand me in much stead. “I bade them seek and summon him: But long ere this, the chase Had scattered, and he was not found. I lay in the same weary stound, Therefore, until the night came round. “It was dead night and near on twelve When the horse-tramp at length Beat up the echoes of the court: By then, my feverish breath was short With pain the sense could scarce support. “My fond nurse sitting near my feet Rose softly,—her lamp's flame Held in her hand, lest it should make My heated lids, in passing, ache; And she passed softly, for my sake. “Returning soon, she brought the youth They spoke of. Meek he seemed, But good knights held him of stout heart. He was akin to us in part, And bore our shield, but barred athwart. “I now remembered to have seen His face, and heard him praised For letter-lore and medicine, Seeing his youth was nurtured in Priests' knowledge, as mine own had been.” The bride's voice did not weaken here, Yet by her sudden pause She seemed to look for questioning; Or else (small need though) 'twas to bring Well to her mind the bygone thing. Her thought, long stagnant, stirred by speech, Gave her a sick recoil; As, dip thy fingers through the green That masks a pool,—where they have been The naked depth is black between. Amelotte kept her knees; her face Was shut within her hands, As it had been throughout the tale; Her forehead's whiteness might avail Nothing to say if she were pale. Although the lattice had dropped loose, There was no wind; the heat Being so at rest that Amelotte Heard far beneath the plunge and float Of a hound swimming in the moat. Some minutes since, two rooks had toiled Home to the nests that crowned Ancestral ash-trees. Through the glare Beating again, they seemed to tear With that thick caw the woof o' the air. But else, 'twas at the dead of noon Absolute silence; all, From the raised bridge and guarded sconce To green-clad places of pleasaùnce Where the long lake was white with swans. Amelotte spoke not any word Nor moved she once; but felt Between her hands in narrow space Her own hot breath upon her face, And kept in silence the same place. Aloÿse did not hear at all The sounds without. She heard The inward voice (past help obey'd) Which might not slacken nor be stay'd, But urged her till the whole were said. Therefore she spoke again: “That night But little could be done: My foot, held in my nurse's hands, He swathed up heedfully in bands, And for my rest gave close commands. “I slept till noon, but an ill sleep Of dreams: through all that day My side was stiff and caught the breath; Next day, such pain as sickeneth Took me, and I was nigh to death. “Life strove, Death claimed me for his own Through days and nights: but now 'Twas the good father tended me, Having returned. Still, I did see The youth I spoke of constantly. “For he would with my brothers come To stay beside my couch, And fix my eyes against his own, Noting my pulse; or else alone, To sit at gaze while I made moan. “(Some nights I knew he kept the watch, Because my women laid The rushes thick for his steel shoes.) Through many days this pain did use The life God would not let me lose. “At length, with my good nurse to aid, I could walk forth again: And still, as one who broods or grieves, At noons I'd meet him and at eves, With idle feet that drove the leaves. “The day when I first walked alone Was thinned in grass and leaf, And yet a goodly day o' the year: The last bird's cry upon mine ear Left my brain weak, it was so clear. “The tears were sharp within mine eyes. I sat down, being glad, And wept; but stayed the sudden flow Anon, for footsteps that fell slow; 'Twas that youth passed me, bowing low. “He passed me without speech; but when, At least an hour gone by, Rethreading the same covert, he Saw I was still beneath the tree, He spoke and sat him down with me. “Little we said; nor one heart heard Even what was said within; And, faltering some farewell, I soon Rose up; but then i' the autumn noon My feeble brain whirled like a swoon. “He made me sit. ‘Cousin, I grieve Your sickness stays by you.’ ‘I would,’ said I, ‘that you did err So grieving. I am wearier Than death, of the sickening dying year.’ “He answered: ‘If your weariness Accepts a remedy, I hold one and can give it you.’ I gazed: ‘What ministers thereto, Be sure,’ I said, ‘that I will do.’ “He went on quickly:—'Twas a cure He had not ever named Unto our kin lest they should stint Their favour, for some foolish hint Of wizardry or magic in't: “But that if he were let to come Within my bower that night, (My women still attending me, He said, while he remain'd there,) he Could teach me the cure privily. “I bade him come that night. He came; But little in his speech Was cure or sickness spoken of, Only a passionate fierce love That clamoured upon God above. “My women wondered, leaning close Aloof. At mine own heart I think great wonder was not stirr'd. I dared not listen, yet I heard His tangled speech, word within word. “He craved my pardon first,—all else Wild tumult. In the end He remained silent at my feet Fumbling the rushes. Strange quick heat Made all the blood of my life meet. “And lo! I loved him. I but said, If he would leave me then, His hope some future might forecast. His hot lips stung my hand: at last My damsels led him forth in haste.” The bride took breath to pause; and turned Her gaze where Amelotte Knelt,—the gold hair upon her back Quite still in all its threads,—the track Of her still shadow sharp and black. That listening without sight had grown To stealthy dread; and now That the one sound she had to mark Left her alone too, she was stark Afraid, as children in the dark. Her fingers felt her temples beat; Then came that brain-sickness Which thinks to scream, and murmureth; And pent between her hands, the breath Was damp against her face like death. Her arms both fell at once; but when She gasped upon the light, Her sense returned. She would have pray'd To change whatever words still stay'd Behind, but felt there was no aid. So she rose up, and having gone Within the window's arch Once more, she sat there, all intent On torturing doubts, and once more bent To hear, in mute bewilderment. But Aloÿse still paused. Thereon Amelotte gathered voice In somewise from the torpid fear Coiled round her spirit. Low but clear She said: “Speak, sister; for I hear.” But Aloÿse threw up her neck And called the name of God:— “Judge, God, 'twixt her and me to-day! She knows how hard this is to say, Yet will not have one word away.” Her sister was quite silent. Then Afresh:—“Not she, dear Lord! Thou be my judge, on Thee I call!” She ceased,—her forehead smote the wall: “Is there a God,” she said “at all”? Amelotte shuddered at the soul, But did not speak. The pause Was long this time. At length the bride Pressed her hand hard against her side, And trembling between shame and pride Said by fierce effort: “From that night Often at nights we met: That night, his passion could but rave: The next, what grace his lips did crave I knew not, but I know I gave.” Where Amelotte was sitting, all The light and warmth of day Were so upon her without shade That the thing seemed by sunshine made Most foul and wanton to be said. She would have questioned more, and known The whole truth at its worst, But held her silent, in mere shame Of day. 'Twas only these words came:— “Sister, thou hast not said his name.” “Sister,” quoth Aloÿse, “thou know'st His name. I said that he Was in a manner of our kin. Waiting the title he might win, They called him the Lord Urscelyn.” The bridegroom's name, to Amelotte Daily familiar,—heard Thus in this dreadful history,— Was dreadful to her; as might be Thine own voice speaking unto thee. The day's mid-hour was almost full; Upon the dial-plate The angel's sword stood near at One. An hour's remaining yet; the sun Will not decrease till all be done. Through the bride's lattice there crept in At whiles (from where the train Of minstrels, till the marriage-call, Loitered at windows of the wall,) Stray lute-notes, sweet and musical. They clung in the green growths and moss Against the outside stone; Low like dirge-wail or requiem They murmured, lost 'twixt leaf and stem: There was no wind to carry them. Amelotte gathered herself back Into the wide recess That the sun flooded: it o'erspread Like flame the hair upon her head And fringed her face with burning red. All things seemed shaken and at change: A silent place o' the hills She knew, into her spirit came: Within herself she said its name And wondered was it still the same. The bride (whom silence goaded) now Said strongly,—her despair By stubborn will kept underneath:— “Sister, 'twere well thou didst not breathe That curse of thine. Give me my wreath.” “Sister,” said Amelotte, “abide In peace. Be God thy judge, As thou hast said—not I. For me, I merely will thank God that he Whom thou hast loved loveth thee.” Then Aloÿse lay back, and laughed With wan lips bitterly, Saying, “Nay, thank thou God for this,— That never any soul like his Shall have its portion where love is.” Weary of wonder, Amelotte Sat silent: she would ask No more, though all was unexplained: She was too weak; the ache still pained Her eyes,—her forehead's pulse remained. The silence lengthened. Aloÿse Was fain to turn her face Apart, to where the arras told Two Testaments, the New and Old, In shapes and meanings manifold. One solace that was gained, she hid. Her sister, from whose curse Her heart recoiled, had blessed instead: Yet would not her pride have it said How much the blessing comforted. Only, on looking round again After some while, the face Which from the arras turned away Was more at peace and less at bay With shame than it had been that day. She spoke right on, as if no pause Had come between her speech: “That year from warmth grew bleak and pass'd,” She said; “the days from first to last How slow,—woe's me! the nights how fast! “From first to last it was not known: My nurse, and of my train Some four or five, alone could tell What terror kept inscrutable: There was good need to guard it well. “Not the guilt only made the shame, But he was without land And born amiss. He had but come To train his youth here at our home, And, being man, depart therefrom. ‘Of the whole time each single day Brought fear and great unrest: It seemed that all would not avail Some once,—that my close watch would fail, And some sign, somehow, tell the tale. “The noble maidens that I knew, My fellows, oftentimes Midway in talk or sport, would look A wonder which my fears mistook, To see how I turned faint and shook. “They had a game of cards, where each By painted arms might find What knight she should be given to. Ever with trembling hand I threw Lest I should learn the thing I knew. “And once it came. And Aure d'Honvaulx Held up the bended shield And laughed: ‘Gramercy for our share!— If to our bridal we but fare To smutch the blazon that we bear!’ “But proud Denise de Villenbois Kissed me, and gave her wench The card, and said: ‘If in these bowers You women play at paramours, You must not mix your game with ours.’ “And one upcast it from her hand: ‘Lo! see how high he'll soar!’ But then their laugh was bitterest; For the wind veered at fate's behest And blew it back into my breast. “Oh! if I met him in the day Or heard his voice,—at meals Or at the Mass or through the hall,— A look turned towards me would appal My heart by seeming to know all. “Yet I grew curious of my shame, And sometimes in the church, On hearing such a sin rebuked, Have held my girdle-glass unhooked To see how such a woman looked. “But if at night he did not come, I lay all deadly cold To think they might have smitten sore And slain him, and as the night wore, His corpse be lying at my door. “And entering or going forth, Our proud shield o'er the gate Seemed to arraign my shrinking eyes. With tremors and unspoken lies The year went past me in this wise. “About the spring of the next year An ailing fell on me; (I had been stronger till the spring;) 'Twas mine old sickness gathering, I thought; but 'twas another thing. “I had such yearnings as brought tears, And a wan dizziness: Motion, like feeling, grew intense; Sight was a haunting evidence And sound a pang that snatched the sense. “It now was hard on that great ill Which lost our wealth from us And all our lands. Accursed be The peevish fools of liberty Who will not let themselves be free! “The Prince was fled into the west: A price was on his blood, But he was safe. To us his friends He left that ruin which attends The strife against God's secret ends. “The league dropped all asunder,—lord, Gentle and serf. Our house Was marked to fall. And a day came When half the wealth that propped our name Went from us in a wind of flame. “Six hours I lay upon the wall And saw it burn. But when It clogged the day in a black bed Of louring vapour, I was led Down to the postern, and we fled. “But ere we fled, there was a voice Which I heard speak, and say That many of our friends, to shun Our fate, had left us and were gone, And that Lord Urscelyn was one. “That name, as was its wont, made sight And hearing whirl. I gave No heed but only to the name: I held my senses, dreading them, And was at strife to look the same. “We rode and rode. As the speed grew, The growth of some vague curse Swarmed in my brain. It seemed to me Numbed by the swiftness, but would be— That still—clear knowledge certainly. “Night lapsed. At dawn the sea was there And the sea-wind: afar The ravening surge was hoarse and loud, And underneath the dim dawn-cloud Each stalking wave shook like a shroud. “From my drawn litter I looked out Unto the swarthy sea, And knew. That voice, which late had cross'd Mine ears, seemed with the foam uptoss'd: I knew that Urscelyn was lost. “Then I spake all: I turned on one And on the other, and spake: My curse laughed in me to behold Their eyes: I sat up, stricken cold, Mad of my voice till all was told. “Oh! of my brothers, Hugues was mute, And Gilles was wild and loud, And Raoul strained abroad his face, As if his gnashing wrath could trace Even there the prey that it must chase. “And round me murmured all our train, Hoarse as the hoarse-tongued sea; Till Hugues from silence louring woke, And cried: ‘What ails the foolish folk? Know ye not frenzy's lightning-stroke?’ “But my stern father came to them And quelled them with his look, Silent and deadly pale. Anon I knew that we were hastening on, My litter closed and the light gone. “And I remember all that day The barren bitter wind Without, and the sea's moaning there That I first moaned with unaware, And when I knew, shook down my hair. “Few followed us or faced our flight: Once only I could hear, Far in the front, loud scornful words, And cries I knew of hostile lords, And crash of spears and grind of swords. “It was soon ended. On that day Before the light had changed We reached our refuge; miles of rock Bulwarked for war; whose strength might mock Sky, sea, or man, to storm or shock. “Listless and feebly conscious, I Lay far within the night Awake. The many pains incurred That day,—the whole, said, seen or heard,— Stayed by in me as things deferred. “Not long. At dawn I slept. In dreams All was passed through afresh From end to end. As the morn heaved Towards noon, I, waking sore aggrieved, That I might die, cursed God, and lived. “Many days went, and I saw none Except my women. They Calmed their wan faces, loving me; And when they wept, lest I should see, Would chaunt a desolate melody. “Panic unthreatened shook my blood Each sunset, all the slow Subsiding of the turbid light. I would rise, sister, as I might, And bathe my forehead through the night “To elude madness. The stark walls Made chill the mirk: and when We oped our curtains, to resume Sun-sickness after long sick gloom, The withering sea-wind walked the room. “Through the gaunt windows the great gales Bore in the tattered clumps Of waif-weed and the tamarisk-boughs; And sea-mews, 'mid the storm's carouse, Were flung, wild-clamouring, in the house. “My hounds I had not; and my hawk, Which they had saved for me, Wanting the sun and rain to beat His wings, soon lay with gathered feet; And my flowers faded, lacking heat. “Such still were griefs: for grief was still A separate sense, untouched Of that despair which had become My life. Great anguish could benumb My soul,—my heart was quarrelsome. “Time crept. Upon a day at length My kinsfolk sat with me: That which they asked was bare and plain: I answered: the whole bitter strain Was again said, and heard again. “Fierce Raoul snatched his sword, and turned The point against my breast. I bared it, smiling: ‘To the heart Strike home,’ I said; ‘another dart Wreaks hourly there a deadlier smart.’ “'Twas then my sire struck down the sword, And said with shaken lips: ‘She from whom all of you receive Your life, so smiled; and I forgive.’ Thus, for my mother's sake, I live. “But I, a mother even as she, Turned shuddering to the wall: For I said: ‘Great God! and what would I do, When to the sword, with the thing I knew, I offered not one life but two!’ “Then I fell back from them, and lay Outwearied. My tired sense Soon filmed and settled, and like stone I slept; till something made me moan, And I woke up at night alone. “I woke at midnight, cold and dazed; Because I found myself Seated upright, with bosom bare, Upon my bed, combing my hair, Ready to go, I knew not where. “It dawned light day,—the last of those Long months of longing days. That noon, the change was wrought on me In somewise,—nought to hear or see,— Only a trance and agony.” The bride's voice failed her, from no will To pause. The bridesmaid leaned, And where the window-panes were white, Looked for the day: she knew not quite If there were either day or night. It seemed to Aloÿse that the whole Day's weight lay back on her Like lead. The hours that did remain Beat their dry wings upon her brain Once in mid-flight, and passed again. There hung a cage of burnt perfumes In the recess: but these, For some hours, weak against the sun, Had simmered in white ash. From One The second quarter was begun. They had not heard the stroke. The air, Though altered with no wind, Breathed now by pauses, so to say: Each breath was time that went away,— Each pause a minute of the day. I' the almonry, the almoner, Hard by, had just dispensed Church-dole and march-dole. High and wide Now rose the shout of thanks, which cried On God that He should bless the bride. Its echo thrilled within their feet, And in the furthest rooms Was heard, where maidens flushed and gay Wove with stooped necks the wreaths alway Fair for the virgin's marriage-day. The mother leaned along, in thought After her child; till tears, Bitter, not like a wedded girl's, Fell down her breast along her curls, And ran in the close work of pearls. The speech ached at her heart. She said: “Sweet Mary, do thou plead This hour with thy most blessed Son To let these shameful words atone, That I may die when I have done.” The thought ached at her soul. Yet now:— “Itself—that life” (she said,) “Out of my weary life—when sense Unclosed, was gone. What evil men's Most evil hands had borne it thence “I knew, and cursed them. Still in sleep I have my child; and pray To know if it indeed appear As in my dream's perpetual sphere, That I—death reached—may seek it there. “Sleeping, I wept; though until dark A fever dried mine eyes Kept open; save when a tear might Be forced from the mere ache of sight. And I nursed hatred day and night. “Aye, and I sought revenge by spells; And vainly many a time Have laid my face into the lap Of a wise woman, and heard clap Her thunder, the fiend's juggling trap. “At length I feared to curse them, lest From evil lips the curse Should be a blessing; and would sit Rocking myself and stifling it With babbled jargon of no wit. “But this was not at first: the days And weeks made frenzied months Before this came. My curses, pil'd Then with each hour unreconcil'd, Still wait for those who took my child.” She stopped, grown fainter. “Amelotte, Surely,” she said, “this sun Sheds judgment-fire from the fierce south: It does not let me breathe: the drouth Is like sand spread within my mouth.” The bridesmaid rose. I' the outer glare Gleamed her pale cheeks, and eyes Sore troubled; and aweary weigh'd Her brows just lifted out of shade; And the light jarred within her head. 'Mid flowers fair-heaped there stood a bowl With water. She therein Through eddying bubbles slid a cup, And offered it, being risen up, Close to her sister's mouth, to sup. The freshness dwelt upon her sense, Yet did not the bride drink; But she dipped in her hand anon And cooled her temples; and all wan With lids that held their ache, went on. “Through those dark watches of my woe, Time, an ill plant, had waxed Apace. That year was finished. Dumb And blind, life's wheel with earth's had come Whirled round: and we might seek our home. “Our wealth was rendered back, with wealth Snatched from our foes. The house Had more than its old strength and fame: But still 'neath the fair outward claim I rankled,—a fierce core of shame. “It chilled me from their eyes and lips Upon a night of those First days of triumph, as I gazed Listless and sick, or scarcely raised My face to mark the sports they praised. “The endless changes of the dance Bewildered me: the tones Of lute and cithern struggled tow'rds Some sense; and still in the last chords The music seemed to sing wild words. “My shame possessed me in the light And pageant, till I swooned. But from that hour I put my shame From me, and cast it over them By God's command and in God's name “For my child's bitter sake. O thou Once felt against my heart With longing of the eyes,—a pain Since to my heart for ever,—then Beheld not, and not felt again!” “She scarcely paused, continuing:— “That year drooped weak in March; And April, finding the streams dry, Choked, with no rain, in dust: the sky Shall not be fainter this July. “Men sickened; beasts lay without strength; The year died in the land. But I, already desolate, Said merely, sitting down to wait,— ‘The seasons change and Time wears late.’ “For I had my hard secret told, In secret, to a priest; With him I communed; and he said The world's soul, for its sins, was sped, And the sun's courses numberèd. “The year slid like a corpse afloat: None trafficked,—who had bread Did eat. That year our legions, come Thinned from the place of war, at home Found busier death, more burdensome. “Tidings and rumours came with them, The first for months. The chiefs Sat daily at our board, and in Their speech were names of friend and kin: One day they spoke of Urscelyn. “The words were light, among the rest: Quick glance my brothers sent To sift the speech; and I, struck through, Sat sick and giddy in full view: Yet did none gaze, so many knew. “Because in the beginning, much Had caught abroad, through them That heard my clamour on the coast: But two were hanged; and then the most Held silence wisdom, as thou know'st. “That year the convent yielded thee Back to our home; and thou Then knew'st not how I shuddered cold To kiss thee, seeming to enfold To my changed heart myself of old. “Then there was showing thee the house, So many rooms and doors; Thinking the while how thou wouldst start If once I flung the doors apart Of one dull chamber in my heart. “And yet I longed to open it; And often in that year Of plague and want, when side by side We've knelt to pray with them that died, My prayer was, ‘Show her what I hide!’” End of Part I JENNY Vengeance of Jenny's case! Fie on her! Never name her, child! —(Mrs. Quickly.) Lazy laughing languid Jenny, Fond of a kiss and fond of a guinea, Whose head upon my knee to-night Rests for a while, as if grown light With all our dances and the sound To which the wild tunes spun you round: Fair Jenny mine, the thoughtless queen Of kisses which the blush between Could hardly make much daintier; Whose eyes are as blue skies, whose hair Is countless gold incomparable: Fresh flower, scarce touched with signs that tell Of Love's exuberant hotbed:—Nay, Poor flower left torn since yesterday Until to-morrow leave you bare; Poor handful of bright spring-water Flung in the whirlpool's shrieking face; Poor shameful Jenny, full of grace Thus with your head upon my knee;— Whose person or whose purse may be The lodestar of your reverie? This room of yours, my Jenny, looks A change from mine so full of books, Whose serried ranks hold fast, forsooth, So many captive hours of youth,— The hours they thieve from day and night To make one's cherished work come right, And leave it wrong for all their theft, Even as to-night my work was left: Until I vowed that since my brain And eyes of dancing seemed so fain, My feet should have some dancing too:— And thus it was I met with you. Well, I suppose 'twas hard to part, For here I am. And now, sweetheart, You seem too tired to get to bed. It was a careless life I led When rooms like this were scarce so strange Not long ago. What breeds the change,— The many aims or the few years? Because to-night it all appears Something I do not know again. The cloud's not danced out of my brain— The cloud that made it turn and swim While hour by hour the books grew dim. Why, Jenny, as I watch you there,— For all your wealth of loosened hair, Your silk ungirdled and unlac'd And warm sweets open to the waist, All golden in the lamplight's gleam,— You know not what a book you seem, Half-read by lightning in a dream! How should you know, my Jenny? Nay, And I should be ashamed to say:— Poor beauty, so well worth a kiss! But while my thought runs on like this With wasteful whims more than enough, I wonder what you're thinking of. If of myself you think at all, What is the thought?—conjectural On sorry matters best unsolved?— Or inly is each grace revolved To fit me with a lure?—or (sad To think!) perhaps you're merely glad That I'm not drunk or ruffianly And let you rest upon my knee. For sometimes, were the truth confess'd, You're thankful for a little rest,— Glad from the crush to rest within, From the heart-sickness and the din Where envy's voice at virtue's pitch Mocks you because your gown is rich; And from the pale girl's dumb rebuke, Whose ill-clad grace and toil-worn look Proclaim the strength that keeps her weak, And other nights than yours bespeak; And from the wise unchildish elf, To schoolmate lesser than himself Pointing you out, what thing you are:— Yes, from the daily jeer and jar, From shame and shame's outbraving too, Is rest not sometimes sweet to you?— But most from the hatefulness of man, Who spares not to end what he began, Whose acts are ill and his speech ill, Who, having used you at his will, Thrusts you aside, as when I dine I serve the dishes and the wine. Well, handsome Jenny mine, sit up: I've filled our glasses, let us sup, And do not let me think of you, Lest shame of yours suffice for two. What, still so tired? Well, well then, keep Your head there, so you do not sleep; But that the weariness may pass And leave you merry, take this glass. Ah! lazy lily hand, more bless'd If ne'er in rings it had been dress'd Nor ever by a glove conceal'd! Behold the lilies of the field, They toil not neither do they spin; (So doth the ancient text begin,— Not of such rest as one of these Can share.) Another rest and ease Along each summer-sated path From its new lord the garden hath, Than that whose spring in blessings ran Which praised the bounteous husbandman, Ere yet, in days of hankering breath, The lilies sickened unto death. What, Jenny, are your lilies dead? Aye, and the snow-white leaves are spread Like winter on the garden-bed. But you had roses left in May,— They were not gone too. Jenny, nay, But must your roses die, and those Their purfled buds that should unclose? Even so; the leaves are curled apart, Still red as from the broken heart, And here's the naked stem of thorns. Nay, nay, mere words. Here nothing warns As yet of winter. Sickness here Or want alone could waken fear,— Nothing but passion wrings a tear. Except when there may rise unsought Haply at times a passing thought Of the old days which seem to be Much older than any history That is written in any book; When she would lie in fields and look Along the ground through the blown grass And wonder where the city was, Far out of sight, whose broil and bale They told her then for a child's tale. Jenny, you know the city now. A child can tell the tale there, how Some things which are not yet enroll'd In market-lists are bought and sold Even till the early Sunday light, When Saturday night is market-night Everywhere, be it dry or wet, And market-night in the Haymarket. Our learned London children know, Poor Jenny, all your pride and woe; Have seen your lifted silken skirt Advertise dainties through the dirt; Have seen your coach-wheels splash rebuke On virtue; and have learned your look When, wealth and health slipped past, you stare Along the streets alone, and there, Round the long park, across the bridge, The cold lamps at the pavement's edge Wind on together and apart, A fiery serpent for your heart. Let the thoughts pass, an empty cloud! Suppose I were to think aloud,— What if to her all this were said? Why, as a volume seldom read Being opened halfway shuts again, So might the pages of her brain Be parted at such words, and thence Close back upon the dusty sense. For is there hue or shape defin'd In Jenny's desecrated mind, Where all contagious currents meet, A Lethe of the middle street? Nay, it reflects not any face, Nor sound is in its sluggish pace, But as they coil those eddies clot, And night and day remember not. Why, Jenny, you're asleep at last!— Asleep, poor Jenny, hard and fast,— So young and soft and tired; so fair, With chin thus nestled in your hair, Mouth quiet, eyelids almost blue As if some sky of dreams shone through! Just as another woman sleeps! Enough to throw one's thoughts in heaps Of doubt and horror,—what to say Or think,—this awful secret sway, The potter's power over the clay! Of the same lump (it has been said) For honour and dishonour made, Two sister vessels. Here is one. My cousin Nell is fond of fun, And fond of dress, and change, and praise, So mere a woman in her ways: And if her sweet eyes rich in youth Are like her lips that tell the truth, My cousin Nell is fond of love. And she's the girl I'm proudest of. Who does not prize her, guard her well? The love of change, in cousin Nell, Shall find the best and hold it dear: The unconquered mirth turn quieter Not through her own, through others' woe: The conscious pride of beauty glow Beside another's pride in her, One little part of all they share. For Love himself shall ripen these In a kind soil to just increase Through years of fertilizing peace. Of the same lump (as it is said) For honour and dishonour made, Two sister vessels. Here is one. It makes a goblin of the sun. So pure,—so fall'n! How dare to think Of the first common kindred link? Yet, Jenny, till the world shall burn It seems that all things take their turn: And who shall say but this fair tree May need, in changes that may be, Your children's children's charity? Scorned then, no doubt, as you are scorn'd! Shall no man hold his pride forewarn'd Till in the end, the Day of Days, At Judgment, one of his own race, As frail and lost as you, shall rise,— His daughter, with his mother's eyes? How Jenny's clock ticks on the shelf! Might not the dial scorn itself That has such hours to register? Yet as to me, even so to her Are golden sun and silver moon, In daily largesse of earth's boon, Counted for life—coins to one tune. And if, as blindfold fates are toss'd, Through some one man this life be lost, Shall soul not somehow pay for soul? Fair shines the gilded aureole In which our highest painters place Some living woman's simple face. And the stilled features thus descried As Jenny's long throat droops aside,— The shadows where the cheeks are thin, And pure wide curve from ear to chin,— With Raffael's, Leonardo's hand To show them to men's souls, might stand, Whole ages long, the whole world through, For preachings of what God can do. What has man done here? How atone, Great God, for this which man has done? And for the body and soul which by Man's pitiless doom must now comply With lifelong hell, what lullaby Of sweet forgetful second birth Remains? All dark. No sign on earth What measure of God's rest endows The many mansions of his house. If but a woman's heart might see Such erring heart unerringly For once! But that can never be. Like a rose shut in a book In which pure women may not look, For its base pages claim control To crush the flower within the soul; Where through each dead rose-leaf that clings, Pale as transparent Psyche-wings, To the vile text, are traced such things As might make lady's cheek indeed More than a living rose to read; So nought save foolish foulness may Watch with hard eyes the sure decay; And so the life-blood of this rose, Puddled with shameful knowledge, flows Through leaves no chaste hand may unclose: Yet still it keeps such faded show Of when 'twas gathered long ago, That the crushed petals' lovely grain, The sweetness of the sanguine stain, Seen of a woman's eyes, must make Her pitiful heart, so prone to ache, Love roses better for its sake:— Only that this can never be:— Even so unto her sex is she. Yet, Jenny, looking long at you, The woman almost fades from view. A cipher of man's changeless sum Of lust, past, present, and to come, Is left. A riddle that one shrinks To challenge from the scornful sphinx. Like a toad within a stone Seated while Time crumbles on; Which sits there since the earth was curs'd For Man's transgression at the first; Which, living through all centuries, Not once has seen the sun arise; Whose life, to its cold circle charmed, The earth's whole summers have not warmed; Which always—whitherso the stone Be flung—sits there, deaf, blind, alone;— Aye, and shall not be driven out Till that which shuts him round about Break at the very Master's stroke, And the dust thereof vanish as smoke, And the seed of Man vanish as dust:— Even so within this world is Lust. Come, come, what use in thoughts like this? Poor little Jenny, good to kiss,— You'd not believe by what strange roads Thought travels, when your beauty goads A man to-night to think of toads! Jenny, wake up....Why, there's the dawn! And there's an early waggon drawn To market, and some sheep that jog Bleating before a barking dog; And the old streets come peering through Another night that London knew; And all as ghostlike as the lamps. So on the wings of day decamps My last night's frolic. Glooms begin To shiver off as lights creep in Past the gauze curtains half drawn-to, And the lamp's doubled shade grows blue,— Your lamp, my Jenny, kept alight, Like a wise virgin's, all one night! And in the alcove coolly spread Glimmers with dawn your empty bed; And yonder your fair face I see Reflected lying on my knee, Where teems with first foreshadowings Your pier-glass scrawled with diamond rings: And on your bosom all night worn Yesterday's rose now droops forlorn, But dies not yet this summer morn. And now without, as if some word Had called upon them that they heard, The London sparrows far and nigh Clamour together suddenly; And Jenny's cage-bird grown awake Here in their song his part must take, Because here too the day doth break. And somehow in myself the dawn Among stirred clouds and veils withdrawn Strikes greyly on her. Let her sleep. But will it wake her if I heap These cushions thus beneath her head Where my knee was? No,—there's your bed, My Jenny, while you dream. And there I lay among your golden hair, Perhaps the subject of your dreams, These golden coins. For still one deems That Jenny's flattering sleep confers New magic on the magic purse,— Grim web, how clogged with shrivelled flies! Between the threads fine fumes arise And shape their pictures in the brain. There roll no streets in glare and rain, Nor flagrant man-swine whets his tusk; But delicately sighs in musk The homage of the dim boudoir; Or like a palpitating star Thrilled into song, the opera-night Breathes faint in the quick pulse of light; Or at the carriage-window shine Rich wares for choice; or, free to dine, Whirls through its hour of health (divine For her) the concourse of the Park. And though in the discounted dark Her functions there and here are one, Beneath the lamps and in the sun There reigns at least the acknowledged belle Apparelled beyond parallel. Ah Jenny, yes, we know your dreams. For even the Paphian Venus seems A goddess o'er the realms of love, When silver-shrined in shadowy grove: Aye, or let offerings nicely plac'd But hide Priapus to the waist, And whoso looks on him shall see An eligible deity. Why, Jenny, waking here alone May help you to remember one, Though all the memory's long outworn Of many a double-pillowed morn. I think I see you when you wake, And rub your eyes for me, and shake My gold, in rising, from your hair, A Danaë for a moment there. Jenny, my love rang true! for still Love at first sight is vague, until That tinkling makes him audible. And must I mock you to the last, Ashamed of my own shame,—aghast Because some thoughts not born amiss Rose at a poor fair face like this? Well, of such thoughts so much I know: In my life, as in hers, they show, By a far gleam which I may near, A dark path I can strive to clear. Only one kiss. Good-bye, my dear. A LAST CONFESSION (Regno Lombardo-Veneto, 1848) Our Lombard country-girls along the coast Wear daggers in their garters: for they know That they might hate another girl to death Or meet a German lover. Such a knife I bought her, with a hilt of horn and pearl. Father, you cannot know of all my thoughts That day in going to meet her,—that last day For the last time, she said;—of all the love And all the hopeless hope that she might change And go back with me. Ah! and everywhere, At places we both knew along the road, Some fresh shape of herself as once she was Grew present at my side; until it seemed— So close they gathered round me—they would all Be with me when I reached the spot at last, To plead my cause with her against herself So changed. O Father, if you knew all this You cannot know, then you would know too, Father, And only then, if God can pardon me. What can be told I'll tell, if you will hear. I passed a village-fair upon my road, And thought, being empty-handed, I would take Some little present: such might prove, I said, Either a pledge between us, or (God help me!) A parting gift. And there it was I bought The knife I spoke of, such as women wear. That day, some three hours afterwards, I found For certain, it must be a parting gift. And, standing silent now at last, I looked Into her scornful face; and heard the sea Still trying hard to din into my ears Some speech it knew which still might change her heart, If only it could make me understand. One moment thus. Another, and her face Seemed further off than the last line of sea, So that I thought, if now she were to speak I could not hear her. Then again I knew All, as we stood together on the sand At Iglio, in the first thin shade o' the hills. “Take it,” I said, and held it out to her, While the hilt glanced within my trembling hold; “Take it and keep it for my sake,” I said. Her neck unbent not, neither did her eyes Move, nor her foot left beating of the sand; Only she put it by from her and laughed. Father, you hear my speech and not her laugh; But God heard that. Will God remember all? It was another laugh than the sweet sound Which rose from her sweet childish heart, that day Eleven years before, when first I found her Alone upon the hill-side; and her curls Shook down in the warm grass as she looked up Out of her curls in my eyes bent to hers. She might have served a painter to pourtray That heavenly child which in the latter days Shall walk between the lion and the lamb. I had been for nights in hiding, worn and sick And hardly fed; and so her words at first Seemed fiftul like the talking of the trees And voices in the air that knew my name. And I remember that I sat me down Upon the slope with her, and thought the world Must be all over or had never been, We seemed there so alone. And soon she told me Her parents both were gone away from her. I thought perhaps she meant that they had died; But when I asked her this, she looked again Into my face and said that yestereve They kissed her long, and wept and made her weep, And gave her all the bread they had with them, And then had gone together up the hill Where we were sitting now, and had walked on Into the great red light; “and so,” she said, “I have come up here too; and when this evening They step out of the light as they stepped in, I shall be here to kiss them.” And she laughed. Then I bethought me suddenly of the famine; And how the church-steps throughout all the town, When last I had been there a month ago, Swarmed with starved folk; and how the bread was weighed By Austrians armed; and women that I knew For wives and mothers walked the public street, Saying aloud that if their husbands feared To snatch the children's food, themselves would stay Till they had earned it there. So then this child Was piteous to me; for all told me then Her parents must have left her to God's chance, To man's or to the Church's charity, Because of the great famine, rather than To watch her growing thin between their knees. With that, God took my mother's voice and spoke, And sights and sounds came back and things long since, And all my childhood found me on the hills; And so I took her with me. I was young. Scarce man then, Father: but the cause which gave The wounds I die of now had brought me then Some wounds already; and I lived alone, As any hiding hunted man must live. It was no easy thing to keep a child In safety; for herself it was not safe, And doubled my own danger: but I knew That God would help me. Yet a little while Pardon me, Father, if I pause. I think I have been speaking to you of some matters There was no need to speak of, have I not? You do not know how clearly those things stood Within my mind, which I have spoken of, Nor how they strove for utterance. Life all past Is like the sky when the sun sets in it, Clearest where furthest off. I told you how She scorned my parting gift and laughed. And yet A woman's laugh's another thing sometimes: I think they laugh in Heaven. I know last night I dreamed I saw into the garden of God, Where women walked whose painted images I have seen with candles round them in the church. They bent this way and that, one to another, Playing: and over the long golden hair Of each there floated like a ring of fire Which when she stooped stooped with her, and when she rose Rose with her. Then a breeze flew in among them, As if a window had been opened in heaven For God to give His blessing from, before This world of ours should set; (for in my dream I thought our world was setting, and the sun Flared, a spent taper;) and beneath that gust The rings of light quivered like forest-leaves. Then all the blessed maidens who were there Stood up together, as it were a voice That called them; and they threw their tresses back, And smote their palms, and all laughed up at once, For the strong heavenly joy they had in them To hear God bless the world. Wherewith I woke: And looking round, I saw as usual That she was standing there with her long locks Pressed to her side; and her laugh ended theirs. For always when I see her now, she laughs. And yet her childish laughter haunts me too, The life of this dead terror; as in days When she, a child, dwelt with me. I must tell Something of those days yet before the end. I brought her from the city—one such day When she was still a merry loving child,— The earliest gift I mind my giving her; A little image of a flying Love Made of our coloured glass-ware, in his hands A dart of gilded metal and a torch. And him she kissed and me, and fain would know Why were his poor eyes blindfold, why the wings And why the arrow. What I knew I told Of Venus and of Cupid,—strange old tales. And when she heard that he could rule the loves Of men and women, still she shook her head And wondered; and, “Nay, nay,” she murmured still, “So strong, and he a younger child than I!” And then she'd have me fix him on the wall Fronting her little bed; and then again She needs must fix him there herself, because I gave him to her and she loved him so, And he should make her love me better yet, If women loved the more, the more they grew. But the fit place upon the wall was high For her, and so I held her in my arms: And each time that the heavy pruning-hook I gave her for a hammer slipped away As it would often, still she laughed and laughed And kissed and kissed me. But amid her mirth, Just as she hung the image on the nail, It slipped and all its fragments strewed the ground: And as it fell she screamed, for in her hand The dart had entered deeply and drawn blood. And so her laughter turned to tears: and “Oh!” I said, the while I bandaged the small hand,— “That I should be the first to make you bleed, Who love and love and love you!”—kissing still The fingers till I got her safe to bed. And still she sobbed,—“not for the pain at all,” She said, “but for the Love, the poor good Love You gave me.” So she cried herself to sleep. Another later thing comes back to me. 'Twas in those hardest foulest days of all, When still from his shut palace, sitting clean Above the splash of blood, old Metternich (May his soul die, and never-dying worms Feast on its pain for ever!) used to thin His year's doomed hundreds daintily, each month Thirties and fifties. This time, as I think, Was when his thrift forbad the poor to take That evil brackish salt which the dry rocks Keep all through winter when the sea draws in. The first I heard of it was a chance shot In the street here and there, and on the stones A stumbling clatter as of horse hemmed round. Then, when she saw me hurry out of doors, My gun slung at my shoulder and my knife Stuck in my girdle, she smoothed down my hair And laughed to see me look so brave, and leaped Up to my neck and kissed me. She was still A child; and yet that kiss was on my lips So hot all day where the smoke shut us in. For now, being always with her, the first love I had—the father's, brother's love—was changed, I think, in somewise; like a holy thought Which is a prayer before one knows of it. The first time I perceived this, I remember, Was once when after hunting I came home Weary, and she brought food and fruit for me, And sat down at my feet upon the floor Leaning against my side. But when I felt Her sweet head reach from that low seat of hers So high as to be laid upon my heart, I turned and looked upon my darling there And marked for the first time how tall she was; And my heart beat with so much violence Under her cheek, I thought she could not choose But wonder at it soon and ask me why; And so I bade her rise and eat with me. And when, remembering all and counting back The time, I made out fourteen years for her And told her so, she gazed at me with eyes As of the sky and sea on a grey day, And drew her long hands through her hair, and asked me If she was not a woman; and then laughed: And as she stooped in laughing, I could see Beneath the growing throat the breasts half-globed Like folded lilies deepset in the stream. Yes, let me think of her as then; for so Her image, Father, is not like the sights Which come when you are gone. She had a mouth Made to bring death to life,—the underlip Sucked in, as if it strove to kiss itself. Her face was pearly pale, as when one stoops Over wan water; and the dark crisped hair And the hair's shadow made it paler still:— Deep-serried locks, the dimness of the cloud Where the moon's gaze is set in eddying gloom. Her body bore her neck as the tree's stem Bears the top branch; and as the branch sustains The flower of the year's pride, her high neck bore That face made wonderful with night and day. Her voice was swift, yet ever the last words Fell lingeringly; and rounded finger-tips She had, that clung a little where they touched And then were gone o' the instant. Her great eyes, That sometimes turned half dizzily beneath The passionate lids, as faint, when she would speak, Had also in them hidden springs of mirth, Which under the dark lashes evermore Shook to her laugh, as when a bird flies low Between the water and the willow-leaves, And the shade quivers till he wins the light. I was a moody comrade to her then, For all the love I bore her. Italy, The weeping desolate mother, long has claimed Her sons' strong arms to lean on, and their hands To lop the poisonous thicket from her path, Cleaving her way to light. And from her need Had grown the fashion of my whole poor life Which I was proud to yield her, as my father Had yielded his. And this had come to be A game to play, a love to clasp, a hate To wreak, all things together that a man Needs for his blood to ripen; till at times All else seemed shadows, and I wondered still To see such life pass muster and be deemed Time's bodily substance. In those hours, no doubt, To the young girl my eyes were like my soul,— Dark wells of death-in-life that yearned for day. And though she ruled me always, I remember That once when I was thus and she still kept Leaping about the place and laughing, I Did almost chide her; whereupon she knelt And putting her two hands into my breast Sang me a song. Are these tears in my eyes? 'Tis long since I have wept for anything. I thought that song forgotten out of mind; And now, just as I spoke of it, it came All back. It is but a rude thing, ill rhymed, Such as a blind man chaunts and his dog hears Holding the platter, when the children run To merrier sport and leave him. Thus it goes:— La bella donna She wept, sweet lady, And said in weeping: “What spell is keeping The stars so steady? Why does the power Of the sun's noon-hour To sleep so move me? And the moon in heaven, Stained where she passes As a worn-out glass is,— Wearily driven, Why walks she above me? “Stars, moon, and sun too, I'm tired of either And all together! Whom speak they unto That I should listen? For very surely, Though my arms and shoulders Dazzle beholders, And my eyes glisten, All's nothing purely! What are words said for At all about them, If he they are made for Can do without them?” She laughed, sweet lady, And said in laughing: “His hand clings half in My own already! Oh! do you love me? Oh! speak of passion In no new fashion, No loud inveighings, But the old sayings You once said of me. “You said: ‘As summer, Through boughs grown brittle, Comes back a little Ere frosts benumb her,— So bring'st thou to me All leaves and flowers, Though autumn's gloomy To-day in the bowers.’ “Oh! does he love me, When my voice teaches The very speeches He then spoke of me? Alas! what flavour Still with me lingers?” (But she laughed as my kisses Glowed in her fingers With love's old blisses.) “Oh! what one favour Remains to woo him, Whose whole poor savour Belongs not to him?” Piangendo disse: “Come son fisse Le stelle in cielo! Quel fiato anelo Dello stanco sole, Quanto m' assonna! E la luna, macchiata Come uno specchio Logoro e vecchio,— Faccia affannata, Che cosa vuole? “Chè stelle, luna, e sole, Ciascun m' annoja E m' annojano insieme; Non me ne preme Nè ci prendo gioja. E veramente, Che le spalle sien franche E le braccia bianche E il seno caldo e tondo, Non mi fa niente. Che cosa al mondo Posso più far di questi Se non piacciono a te, come dicesti?” La donna rise E riprese ridendo:— “Questa mano che prendo È dunque mia? Tu m' ami dunque? Dimmelo ancora, Non in modo qualunque, Ma le parole Belle e precise Che dicesti pria. ‘Siccome suole La state talora (Dicesti) un qualche istante Tornare innanzi inverno, Cosi tu fai ch' io scerno Le foglie tutte quante, Ben ch' io certo tenessi Per passato l'autunno.’ “Eccolo il mio alunno! Io debbo insegnargli Quei cari detti istessi Ch' ei mi disse una volta! Oimè! Che cosa dargli,” (Ma ridea piano piano Dei baci in sulla mano,) “Ch' ei non m' abbia da lungo tempo tolta?” That I should sing upon this bed!—with you To listen, and such words still left to say! Yet was it I that sang? The voice seemed hers, As on the very day she sang to me; When, having done, she took out of my hand Something that I had played with all the while And laid it down beyond my reach; and so Turning my face round till it fronted hers,— “Weeping or laughing, which was best?” she said. But these are foolish tales. How should I show The heart that glowed then with love's heat, each day More and more brightly?—when for long years now The very flame that flew about the heart, And gave it fiery wings, has come to be The lapping blaze of hell's environment Whose tongues all bid the molten heart despair. Yet one more thing comes back on me to-night Which I may tell you: for it bore my soul Dread firstlings of the brood that rend it now. It chanced that in our last year's wanderings We dwelt at Monza, far away from home, If home we had: and in the Duomo there I sometimes entered with her when she prayed. An image of Our Lady stands there, wrought In marble by some great Italian hand In the great days when she and Italy Sat on one throne together: and to her And to none else my loved one told her heart. She was a woman then; and as she knelt,— Her sweet brow in the sweet brow's shadow there,— They seemed two kindred forms whereby our land (Whose work still serves the world for miracle) Made manifest herself in womanhood. Father, the day I speak of was the first For weeks that I had borne her company Into the Duomo; and those weeks had been Much troubled, for then first the glimpses came Of some impenetrable restlessness Growing in her to make her changed and cold. And as we entered there that day, I bent My eyes on the fair Image, and I said Within my heart, “Oh turn her heart to me!” And so I left her to her prayers, and went To gaze upon the pride of Monza's shrine, Where in the sacristy the light still falls Upon the Iron Crown of Italy, On whose crowned heads the day has closed, nor yet The daybreak gilds another head to crown. But coming back, I wondered when I saw That the sweet Lady of her prayers now stood Alone without her; until further off, Before some new Madonna gaily decked, Tinselled and gewgawed, a slight German toy, I saw her kneel, still praying. At my step She rose, and side by side we left the church. I was much moved, and sharply questioned her Of her transferred devotion; but she seemed Stubborn and heedless; till she lightly laughed And said: “The old Madonna? Aye indeed, She had my old thoughts,—this one has my new.” Then silent to the soul I held my way: And from the fountains of the public place Unto the pigeon-haunted pinnacles, Bright wings and water winnowed the bright air; And stately with her laugh's subsiding smile She went, with clear-swayed waist and towering neck And hands held light before her; and the face Which long had made a day in my life's night Was night in day to me; as all men's eyes Turned on her beauty, and she seemed to tread Beyond my heart to the world made for her. Ah there! my wounds will snatch my sense again: The pain comes billowing on like a full cloud Of thunder, and the flash that breaks from it Leaves my brain burning. That's the wound he gave, The Austrian whose white coat I still made match With his white face, only the two grew red As suits his trade. The devil makes them wear White for a livery, that the blood may show Braver that brings them to him. So he looks Sheer o'er the field and knows his own at once. Give me a draught of water in that cup; My voice feels thick; perhaps you do not hear; But you must hear. If you mistake my words And so absolve me, I am sure the blessing Will burn my soul. If you mistake my words And so absolve me, Father, the great sin Is yours, not mine: mark this: your soul shall burn With mine for it. I have seen pictures where Souls burned with Latin shriekings in their mouths: Shall my end be as theirs? Nay, but I know 'Tis you shall shriek in Latin. Some bell rings, Rings through my brain: it strikes the hour in hell. You see I cannot, Father; I have tried, But cannot, as you see. These twenty times Beginning, I have come to the same point And stopped. Beyond, there are but broken words Which will not let you understand my tale. It is that then we have her with us here, As when she wrung her hair out in my dream To-night, till all the darkness reeked of it. Her hair is always wet, for she has kept Its tresses wrapped about her side for years; And when she wrung them round over the floor, I heard the blood between her fingers hiss; So that I sat up in my bed and screamed Once and again; and once to once, she laughed. Look that you turn not now,—she's at your back: Gather your robe up, Father, and keep close, Or she'll sit down on it and send you mad. At Iglio in the first thin shade o' the hills The sand is black and red. The black was black When what was spilt that day sank into it, And the red scarcely darkened. There I stood This night with her, and saw the sand the same. What would you have me tell you? Father, father, How shall I make you know? You have not known The dreadful soul of woman, who one day Forgets the old and takes the new to heart, Forgets what man remembers, and therewith Forgets the man. Nor can I clearly tell How the change happened between her and me. Her eyes looked on me from an emptied heart When most my heart was full of her; and still In every corner of myself I sought To find what service failed her; and no less Than in the good time past, there all was hers. What do you love? Your Heaven? Conceive it spread For one first year of all eternity All round you with all joys and gifts of God; And then when most your soul is blent with it And all yields song together,—then it stands O' the sudden like a pool that once gave back Your image, but now drowns it and is clear Again,—or like a sun bewitched, that burns Your shadow from you, and still shines in sight. How could you bear it? Would you not cry out, Among those eyes grown blind to you, those ears That hear no more your voice you hear the same,— “God! what is left but hell for company, But hell, hell, hell?”—until the name so breathed Whirled with hot wind and sucked you down in fire? Even so I stood the day her empty heart Left her place empty in our home, while yet I knew not why she went nor where she went Nor how to reach her: so I stood the day When to my prayers at last one sight of her Was granted, and I looked on heaven made pale With scorn, and heard heaven mock me in that laugh. O sweet, long sweet! Was that some ghost of you, Even as your ghost that haunts me now,—twin shapes Of fear and hatred? May I find you yet Mine when death wakes? Ah! be it even in flame, We may have sweetness yet, if you but say As once in childish sorrow: “Not my pain, My pain was nothing: oh your poor poor love, Your broken love!” My Father, have I not Yet told you the last things of that last day On which I went to meet her by the sea? O God, O God! but I must tell you all. Midway upon my journey, when I stopped To buy the dagger at the village fair, I saw two cursed rats about the place I knew for spies—blood-sellers both. That day Was not yet over; for three hours to come I prized my life: and so I looked around For safety. A poor painted mountebank Was playing tricks and shouting in a crowd. I knew he must have heard my name, so I Pushed past and whispered to him who I was, And of my danger. Straight he hustled me Into his booth, as it were in the trick, And brought me out next minute with my face All smeared in patches and a zany's gown; And there I handed him his cups and balls And swung the sand-bags round to clear the ring For half an hour. The spies came once and looked; And while they stopped, and made all sights and sounds Sharp to my startled senses, I remember A woman laughed above me. I looked up And saw where a brown-shouldered harlot leaned Half through a tavern window thick with vine. Some man had come behind her in the room And caught her by her arms, and she had turned With that coarse empty laugh on him, as now He munched her neck with kisses, while the vine Crawled in her back. And three hours afterwards, When she that I had run all risks to meet Laughed as I told you, my life burned to death Within me, for I thought it like the laugh Heard at the fair. She had not left me long; But all she might have changed to, or might change to, (I know nought since—she never speaks a word—) Seemed in that laugh. Have I not told you yet, Not told you all this time what happened, Father, When I had offered her the little knife, And bade her keep it for my sake that loved her, And she had laughed? Have I not told you yet? “Take it,” I said to her the second time, “Take it and keep it.” And then came a fire That burnt my hand; and then the fire was blood, And sea and sky were blood and fire, and all The day was one red blindness; till it seemed, Within the whirling brain's eclipse, that she Or I or all things bled or burned to death. And then I found her laid against my feet And knew that I had stabbed her, and saw still Her look in falling. For she took the knife Deep in her heart, even as I bade her then, And fell; and her stiff bodice scooped the sand Into her bosom. And she keeps it, see, Do you not see she keeps it?—there, beneath Wet fingers and wet tresses, in her heart. For look you, when she stirs her hand, it shows The little hilt of horn and pearl,—even such A dagger as our women of the coast Twist in their garters. Father, I have done: And from her side now she unwinds the thick Dark hair; all round her side it is wet through, But, like the sand at Iglio, does not change. Now you may see the dagger clearly. Father, I have told all: tell me at once what hope Can reach me still. For now she draws it out Slowly, and only smiles as yet: look, Father, She scarcely smiles: but I shall hear her laugh Soon, when she shows the crimson steel to God. THE BURDEN OF NINEVEH In our Museum galleries To-day I lingered o'er the prize Dead Greece vouchsafes to living eyes,— Her Art for ever in fresh wise From hour to hour rejoicing me. Sighing I turned at last to win Once more the London dirt and din; And as I made the swing-door spin And issued, they were hoisting in A wingèd beast from Nineveh. A human face the creature wore, And hoofs behind and hoofs before, And flanks with dark runes fretted o'er. 'Twas bull, 'twas mitred Minotaur, A dead disbowelled mystery: The mummy of a buried faith Stark from the charnel without scathe, Its wings stood for the light to bathe,— Such fossil cerements as might swathe The very corpse of Nineveh. The print of its first rush-wrapping, Wound ere it dried, still ribbed the thing. What song did the brown maidens sing, From purple mouths alternating, When that was woven languidly? What vows, what rites, what prayers preferr'd, What songs has the strange image heard? In what blind vigil stood interr'd For ages, till an English word Broke silence first at Nineveh? Oh when upon each sculptured court, Where even the wind might not resort,— O'er which Time passed, of like import With the wild Arab boys at sport,— A living face looked in to see:— Oh seemed it not—the spell once broke— As though the carven warriors woke, As though the shaft the string forsook, The cymbals clashed, the chariots shook, And there was life in Nineveh? On London stones our sun anew The beast's recovered shadow threw. (No shade that plague of darkness knew, No light, no shade, while older grew By ages the old earth and sea.) Lo thou! could all thy priests have shown Such proof to make thy godhead known? From their dead Past thou liv'st alone; And still thy shadow is thine own, Even as of yore in Nineveh. That day whereof we keep record, When near thy city-gates the Lord Sheltered His Jonah with a gourd, This sun, (I said) here present, pour'd Even thus this shadow that I see. This shadow has been shed the same From sun and moon,—from lamps which came For prayer,—from fifteen days of flame, The last, while smouldered to a name Sardanapalus' Nineveh. Within thy shadow, haply, once Sennacherib has knelt, whose sons Smote him between the altar-stones: Or pale Semiramis her zones Of gold, her incense brought to thee, In love for grace, in war for aid:... Ay, and who else?...till 'neath thy shade Within his trenches newly made Last year the Christian knelt and pray'd— Not to thy strength—in Nineveh. During the excavations, the Tiyari workmen held their services in the shadow of the great bulls.—(Layard's “Nineveh,” chap. ix.) Now, thou poor god, within this hall Where the blank windows blind the wall From pedestal to pedestal, The kind of light shall on thee fall Which London takes the day to be: While school-foundations in the act Of holiday, three files compact, Shall learn to view thee as a fact Connected with that zealous tract: “Rome,—Babylon and Nineveh.” Deemed they of this, those worshippers, When, in some mythic chain of verse Which man shall not again rehearse, The faces of thy ministers Yearned pale with bitter ecstasy? Greece, Egypt, Rome,—did any god Before whose feet men knelt unshod Deem that in this unblest abode Another scarce more unknown god Should house with him, from Nineveh? Ah! in what quarries lay the stone From which this pillared pile has grown, Unto man's need how long unknown, Since those thy temples, court and cone, Rose far in desert history? Ah! what is here that does not lie All strange to thine awakened eye? Ah! what is here can testify (Save that dumb presence of the sky) Unto thy day and Nineveh? Why, of those mummies in the room Above, there might indeed have come One out of Egypt to thy home, An alien. Nay, but were not some Of these thine own “antiquity”? And now,—they and their gods and thou All relics here together,—now Whose profit? whether bull or cow, Isis or Ibis, who or how, Whether of Thebes or Nineveh? The consecrated metals found, And ivory tablets, underground, Winged teraphim and creatures crown'd. When air and daylight filled the mound, Fell into dust immediately. And even as these, the images Of awe and worship,—even as these,— So, smitten with the sun's increase, Her glory mouldered and did cease From immemorial Nineveh. The day her builders made their halt, Those cities of the lake of salt Stood firmly 'stablished without fault, Made proud with pillars of basalt, With sardonyx and porphyry. The day that Jonah bore abroad To Nineveh the voice of God, A brackish lake lay in his road, Where erst Pride fixed her sure abode, As then in royal Nineveh. The day when he, Pride's lord and Man's, Showed all the kingdoms at a glance To Him before whose countenance The years recede, the years advance, And said, Fall down and worship me:— 'Mid all the pomp beneath that look, Then stirred there, haply, some rebuke, Where to the wind the Salt Pools shook, And in those tracts, of life forsook, That knew thee not, O Nineveh! Delicate harlot! On thy throne Thou with a world beneath thee prone In state for ages sat'st alone; And needs were years and lustres flown Ere strength of man could vanquish thee: Whom even thy victor foes must bring, Still royal, among maids that sing As with doves' voices, taboring Upon their breasts, unto the King,— A kingly conquest, Nineveh! ...Here woke my thought. The wind's slow sway Had waxed; and like the human play Of scorn that smiling spreads away, The sunshine shivered off the day: The callous wind, it seemed to me, Swept up the shadow from the ground: And pale as whom the Fates astound, The god forlorn stood winged and crown'd: Within I knew the cry lay bound Of the dumb soul of Nineveh. And as I turned, my sense half shut Still saw the crowds of kerb and rut Go past as marshalled to the strut Of ranks in gypsum quaintly cut. It seemed in one same pageantry They followed forms which had been erst; To pass, till on my sight should burst That future of the best or worst When some may question which was first, Of London or of Nineveh. For as that Bull-god once did stand And watched the burial-clouds of sand, Till these at last without a hand Rose o'er his eyes, another land, And blinded him with destiny:— So may he stand again; till now, In ships of unknown sail and prow, Some tribe of the Australian plough Bear him afar,—a relic now Of London, not of Nineveh! Or it may chance indeed that when Man's age is hoary among men,— His centuries threescore and ten,— His furthest childhood shall seem then More clear than later times may be: Who, finding in this desert place This form, shall hold us for some race That walked not in Christ's lowly ways, But bowed its pride and vowed its praise Unto the God of Nineveh. The smile rose first,—anon drew nigh The thought:...Those heavy wings spread high, So sure of flight, which do not fly; That set gaze never on the sky; Those scriptured flanks it cannot see; Its crown, a brow-contracting load; Its planted feet which trust the sod:... (So grew the image as I trod:) O Nineveh, was this thy God,— Thine also, mighty Nineveh? THE STAFF AND SCRIP “Who rules these lands?” the Pilgrim said. “Stranger, Queen Blanchelys.” “And who has thus harried them?” he said. “It was Duke Luke did this: God's ban be his!” The Pilgrim said: “Where is your house? I'll rest there, with your will.” “You've but to climb these blackened boughs And you'll see it over the hill, For it burns still.” “Which road, to seek your Queen?” said he. “Nay, nay, but with some wound You'll fly back hither, it may be, And by your blood i' the ground My place be found.” “Friend, stay in peace. God keep your head, And mine, where I will go; For He is here and there,” he said. He passed the hill-side, slow. And stood below. The Queen sat idle by her loom; She heard the arras stir, And looked up sadly: through the room The sweetness sickened her Of musk and myrrh. Her women, standing two and two, In silence combed the fleece. The Pilgrim said, “Peace be with you, Lady;” and bent his knees. She answered, “Peace.” Her eyes were like the wave within; Like water-reed the poise Of her soft body, dainty thin; And like the water's noise Her plaintive voice. For him, the stream had never well'd In desert tracts malign So sweet; nor had he ever felt So faint in the sunshine Of Palestine. Right so, he knew that he saw weep Each night through every dream The Queen's own face, confused in sleep With visages supreme Not known to him. “Lady,” he said, “your lands lie burnt And waste: to meet your foe All fear: this I have seen and learnt. Say that it shall be so, And I will go.” She gazed at him. “Your cause is just, For I have heard the same,” He said: “God's strength shall be my trust. Fall it to good or grame, 'Tis in His name.” “Sir, you are thanked. My cause is dead. Why should you toil to break A grave, and fall therein?” she said. He did not pause but spake: “For my vow's sake.” “Can such vows be, Sir—to God's ear, Not to God's will?” “My vow Remains: God heard me there as here,” He said with reverent brow, “Both then and now.” They gazed together, he and she, The minute while he spoke; And when he ceased, she suddenly Looked round upon her folk As though she woke. “Fight, Sir,” she said; “my prayers in pain Shall be your fellowship.” He whispered one among her train,— “To-morrow bid her keep This staff and scrip.” She sent him a sharp sword, whose belt About his body there As sweet as her own arms he felt. He kissed its blade, all bare, Instead of her. She sent him a green banner wrought With one white lily stem, To bind his lance with when he fought. He writ upon the same And kissed her name. She sent him a white shield, whereon She bade that he should trace His will. He blent fair hues that shone, And in a golden space He kissed her face. Born of the day that died, that eve Now dying sank to rest; As he, in likewise taking leave, Once with a heaving breast Looked to the west. And there the sunset skies unseal'd, Like lands he never knew, Beyond to-morrow's battle-field Lay open out of view To ride into. Next day till dark the women pray'd: Nor any might know there How the fight went: the Queen has bade That there do come to her No messenger. The Queen is pale, her maidens ail; And to the organ-tones They sing but faintly, who sang well The matin-orisons, The lauds and nones. Lo, Father, is thine ear inclin'd, And hath thine angel pass'd? For these thy watchers now are blind With vigil, and at last Dizzy with fast. Weak now to them the voice o' the priest As any trance affords; And when each anthem failed and ceas'd, It seemed that the last chords Still sang the words. “Oh what is the light that shines so red? 'Tis long since the sun set;” Quoth the youngest to the eldest maid: “'Twas dim but now, and yet The light is great.” Quoth the other: “'Tis our sight is dazed That we see flame i' the air.” But the Queen held her brows and gazed, And said, “It is the glare Of torches there.” “Oh what are the sounds that rise and spread? All day it was so still;” Quoth the youngest to the eldest maid: “Unto the furthest hill The air they fill.” Quoth the other: “'Tis our sense is blurr'd With all the chants gone by.” But the Queen held her breath and heard, And said, “It is the cry Of Victory.” The first of all the rout was sound, The next were dust and flame, And then the horses shook the ground: And in the thick of them A still band came. “Oh what do ye bring out of the fight, Thus hid beneath these boughs?” “Thy conquering guest returns to-night, And yet shall not carouse, Queen, in thy house.” “Uncover ye his face,” she said. “O changed in little space!” She cried, “O pale that was so red! O God, O God of grace! Cover his face.” His sword was broken in his hand Where he had kissed the blade. “O soft steel that could not withstand! O my hard heart unstayed, That prayed and prayed!” His bloodied banner crossed his mouth Where he had kissed her name. “O east, and west, and north, and south, Fair flew my web, for shame, To guide Death's aim!” The tints were shredded from his shield Where he had kissed her face. “Oh, of all gifts that I could yield, Death only keeps its place, My gift and grace!” Then stepped a damsel to her side, And spoke, and needs must weep: “For his sake, lady, if he died, He prayed of thee to keep This staff and scrip.” That night they hung above her bed, Till morning wet with tears. Year after year above her head Her bed his token wears, Five years, ten years. That night the passion of her grief Shook them as there they hung. Each year the wind that shed the leaf Shook them and in its tongue A message flung. And once she woke with a clear mind That letters writ to calm Her soul lay in the scrip; to find Only a torpid balm And dust of palm. They shook far off with palace sport When joust and dance were rife; And the hunt shook them from the court; For hers, in peace or strife, Was a Queen's life. A Queen's death now: as now they shake To gusts in chapel dim,— Hung where she sleeps, not seen to wake, (Carved lovely white and slim), With them by him. Stand up to-day, still armed, with her, Good knight, before His brow Who then as now was here and there, Who had in mind thy vow Then even as now. The lists are set in Heaven to-day, The bright pavilions shine; Fair hangs thy shield, and none gainsay; The trumpets sound in sign That she is thine. Not tithed with days' and years' decease He pays thy wage He owed, But with imperishable peace Here in His own abode Thy jealous God. SISTER HELEN “Why did you melt your waxen man, Sister Helen? To-day is the third since you began.” “The time was long, yet the time ran, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Three days to-day, between Hell and Heaven!) “But if you have done your work aright, Sister Helen, You'll let me play, for you said I might.” “Be very still in your play to-night, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Third night, to-night, between Hell and Heaven!) “You said it must melt ere vesper-bell, Sister Helen; If now it be molten, all is well.” “Even so,—nay, peace! you cannot tell, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, O what is this, between Hell and Heaven?) “Oh the waxen knave was plump to-day, Sister Helen; How like dead folk he has dropped away!” “Nay now, of the dead what can you say, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What of the dead, between Hell and Heaven?) “See, see, the sunken pile of wood, Sister Helen, Shines through the thinned wax red as blood!” “Nay now, when looked you yet on blood, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, How pale she is, between Hell and Heaven!) “Now close your eyes, for they're sick and sore, Sister Helen, And I'll play without the gallery door.” “Aye, let me rest,—I'll lie on the floor, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What rest to-night, between Hell and Heaven?) “Here high up in the balcony, Sister Helen, The moon flies face to face with me.” “Aye, look and say whatever you see, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What sight to-night, between Hell and Heaven?) “Outside it's merry in the wind's wake, Sister Helen; In the shaken trees the chill stars shake.” “Hush, heard you a horse-tread as you spake, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What sound to-night, between Hell and Heaven?) “I hear a horse-tread, and I see, Sister Helen, Three horsemen that ride terribly.” “Little brother, whence come the three, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Whence should they come, between Hell and Heaven?) “They come by the hill-verge from Boyne Bar, Sister Helen, And one draws nigh, but two are afar.” “Look, look, do you know them who they are, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Who should they be, between Hell and Heaven?) “Oh, it's Keith of Eastholm rides so fast, Sister Helen, For I know the white mane on the blast.” “The hour has come, has come at last, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Her hour at last, between Hell and Heaven!) “He has made a sign and called Halloo! Sister Helen, And he says that he would speak with you.” “Oh tell him I fear the frozen dew, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Why laughs she thus, between Hell and Heaven?) “The wind is loud, but I hear him cry, Sister Helen, That Keith of Ewern's like to die.” “And he and thou, and thou and I, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, And they and we, between Hell and Heaven!) “Three days ago, on his marriage-morn, Sister Helen, He sickened, and lies since then forlorn.” “For bridegroom's side is the bride a thorn, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Cold bridal cheer, between Hell and Heaven!) “Three days and nights he has lain abed, Sister Helen, And he prays in torment to be dead.” “The thing may chance, if he have prayed, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, If he have prayed, between Hell and Heaven!) “But he has not ceased to cry to-day, Sister Helen, That you should take your curse away.” “My prayer was heard,—he need but pray, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Shall God not hear, between Hell and Heaven?) “But he says, till you take back your ban, Sister Helen, His soul would pass, yet never can.” “Nay, then shall I slay a living man, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, A living soul, between Hell and Heaven!) “But he calls for ever on your name, Sister Helen, And says that he melts before a flame.” “My heart for his pleasure fared the same Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Fire at the heart, between Hell and Heaven!) “Here's Keith of Westholm riding fast, Sister Helen, For I know the white plume on the blast.” “The hour, the sweet hour I forecast, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Is the hour sweet, between Hell and Heaven?) “He stops to speak, and he stills his horse, Sister Helen; But his words are drowned in the wind's course.” “Nay hear, nay hear, you must hear perforce, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What word now heard, between Hell and Heaven?) “Oh he says that Keith of Ewern's cry, Sister Helen, Is ever to see you ere he die.” “In all that his soul sees, there am I, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, The soul's one sight, between Hell and Heaven!) “He sends a ring and a broken coin, Sister Helen, And bids you mind the banks of Boyne.” “What else he broke will he ever join, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, No, never joined, between Hell and Heaven!) “He yields you these and craves full fain, Sister Helen, You pardon him in his mortal pain.” “What else he took will he give again, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Not twice to give, between Hell and Heaven!) “He calls your name in an agony, Sister Helen, That even dead Love must weep to see.” “Hate, born of Love, is blind as he, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Love turned to hate, between Hell and Heaven!) “Oh it's Keith of Keith now that rides fast, Sister Helen, For I know the white hair on the blast.” “The short short hour will soon be past, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Will soon be past, between Hell and Heaven!) “He looks at me and he tries to speak, Sister Helen, But oh! his voice is sad and weak!” “What here should the mighty Baron seek, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Is this the end, between Hell and Heaven?) “Oh his son still cries, if you forgive, Sister Helen, The body dies but the soul shall live.” “Fire shall forgive me as I forgive, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, As she forgives, between Hell and Heaven!) “Oh he prays you, as his heart would rive, Sister Helen, To save his dear son's soul alive.” “Fire cannot slay it, it shall thrive, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Alas, alas, between Hell and Heaven!) “He cries to you, kneeling in the road, Sister Helen, To go with him for the love of God!” “The way is long to his son's abode, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, The way is long, between Hell and Heaven!) “A lady's here, by a dark steed brought, Sister Helen, So darkly clad, I saw her not.” “See her now or never see aught, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What more to see, between Hell and Heaven?) “Her hood falls back, and the moon shines fair, Sister Helen, On the Lady of Ewern's golden hair.” “Blest hour of my power and her despair, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Hour blest and bann'd, between Hell and Heaven!) “Pale, pale her cheeks, that in pride did glow, Sister Helen, 'Neath the bridal-wreath three days ago.” “One morn for pride and three days for woe, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Three days, three nights, between Hell and Heaven!) “Her clasped hands stretch from her bending head, Sister Helen; With the loud wind's wail her sobs are wed.” “What wedding-strains hath her bridal-bed, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What strain but death's, between Hell and Heaven?) “She may not speak, she sinks in a swoon, Sister Helen,— She lifts her lips and gasps on the moon.” “Oh! might I but hear her soul's blithe tune, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Her woe's dumb cry, between Hell and Heaven!) “They've caught her to Westholm's saddle-bow, Sister Helen, And her moonlit hair gleams white in its flow.” “Let it turn whiter than winter snow, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Woe-withered gold, between Hell and Heaven!) “O Sister Helen, you heard the bell, Sister Helen! More loud than the vesper-chime it fell.” “No vesper-chime, but a dying knell, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, His dying knell, between Hell and Heaven!) “Alas! but I fear the heavy sound, Sister Helen; Is it in the sky or in the ground?” “Say, have they turned their horses round, Little brother?” (O Mother, Mary Mother, What would she more, between Hell and Heaven?) “They have raised the old man from his knee, Sister Helen, And they ride in silence hastily.” “More fast the naked soul doth flee, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, The naked soul, between Hell and Heaven!) “Flank to flank are the three steeds gone, Sister Helen, But the lady's dark steed goes alone.” “And lonely her bridegroom's soul hath flown, Little brother.” (O Mother, Mary Mother, The lonely ghost, between Hell and Heaven!) “Oh the wind is sad in the iron chill, Sister Helen, And weary sad they look by the hill.” “But he and I are sadder still, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Most sad of all, between Hell and Heaven!) “See, see, the wax has dropped from its place, Sister Helen, And the flames are winning up apace!” “Yet here they burn but for a space, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Here for a space, between Hell and Heaven!) “Ah! what white thing at the door has cross'd? Sister Helen? Ah! what is this that sighs in the frost?” “A soul that's lost as mine is lost, Little brother!” (O Mother, Mary Mother, Lost, lost, all lost, between Hell and Heaven!) LOVE'S NOCTURN Master of the murmuring courts Where the shapes of sleep convene!— Lo! my spirit here exhorts All the powers of thy demesne For their aid to woo my queen. What reports Yield thy jealous courts unseen? Vaporous, unaccountable, Dreamworld lies forlorn of light, Hollow like a breathing shell. Ah! that from all dreams I might Choose one dream and guide its flight! I know well What her sleep should tell to-night. There the dreams are multitudes: Some that will not wait for sleep, Deep within the August woods; Some that hum while rest may steep Weary labour laid a-heap; Interludes, Some, of grievous moods that weep. Poets' fancies all are there: There the elf-girls flood with wings Valleys full of plaintive air; There breathe perfumes; there in rings Whirl the foam-bewildered springs; Siren there Winds her dizzy hair and sings. Thence the one dream mutually Dreamed in bridal unison, Less than waking ecstasy; Half-formed visions that make moan In the house of birth alone; And what we At death's wicket see, unknown. But for mine own sleep, it lies In one gracious form's control, Fair with honourable eyes, Lamps of a translucent soul: O their glance is loftiest dole, Sweet and wise, Wherein Love descries his goal. Reft of her, my dreams are all Clammy trance that fears the sky: Changing footpaths shift and fall; From polluted coverts nigh, Miserable phantoms sigh; Quakes the pall, And the funeral goes by. Master, is it soothly said That, as echoes of man's speech Far in secret clefts are made, So do all men's bodies reach Shadows o'er thy sunken beach,— Shape or shade In those halls pourtrayed of each? Ah! might I, by thy good grace Groping in the windy stair, (Darkness and the breath of space Like loud waters everywhere,) Meeting mine own image there Face to face, Send it from that place to her! Nay, not I; but oh! do thou, Master, from thy shadowkind Call my body's phantom now: Bid it bear its face declin'd Till its slight her slumbers find, And her brow Feel its presence bow like wind. Where in groves the gracile Spring Trembles, with mute orison Confidently strengthening, Water's voice and wind's as one Shed an echo in the sun. Soft as Spring, Master, bid it sing and moan. Song shall tell how glad and strong Is the night she soothes alway; Moan shall grieve with that parched tongue Of the brazen hours of day: Sounds as of the springtide they, Moan and song, While the chill months long for May. Not the prayers which with all leave The world's fluent woes prefer,— Not the praise the world doth give, Dulcet fulsome whisperer;— Let it yield my love to her, And achieve Strength that shall not grieve or err. Wheresoe'er my dreams befall, Both at night-watch, (let it say,) And where round the sundial The reluctant hours of day, Heartless, hopeless of their way, Rest and call;— There her glance doth fall and stay. Suddenly her face is there: So do mounting vapours wreathe Subtle-scented transports where The black firwood sets its teeth. Part the boughs and look beneath,— Lilies share Secret waters there, and breathe. Master, bid my shadow bend Whispering thus till birth of light, Lest new shapes that sleep may send Scatter all its work to flight;— Master, master of the night, Bid it spend Speech, song, prayer, and end aright. Yet, ah me! if at her head There another phantom lean Murmuring o'er the fragrant bed,— Ah! and if my spirit's queen Smile those alien prayers between,— Ah! poor shade! Shall it strive, or fade unseen? How should love's own messenger Strive with love and be love's foe? Master, nay! If thus, in her, Sleep a wedded heart should show,— Silent let mine image go, Its old share Of thy spell-bound air to know. Like a vapour wan and mute, Like a flame, so let it pass; One low sigh across her lute, One dull breath against her glass; And to my sad soul, alas! One salute Cold as when Death's foot shall pass. Then, too, let all hopes of mine, All vain hopes by night and day, Slowly at thy summoning sign Rise up pallid and obey. Dreams, if this is thus, were they:— Be they thine, And to dreamworld pine away. Yet from old time, life, not death, Master, in thy rule is rife: Lo! through thee, with mingling breath, Adam woke beside his wife. O Love, bring me so, for strife, Force and faith, Bring me so not death but life! Yea, to Love himself is pour'd This frail song of hope and fear. Thou art Love, of one accord With kind Sleep to bring her near, Still-eyed, deep-eyed, ah how dear! Master, Lord, In her name implor'd, O hear! THE HOUSE OF LIFE: A SONNET-SEQUENCE [A Sonnet is a moment's monument,—] A Sonnet is a moment's monument,— Memorial from the Soul's eternity To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be, Whether for lustral rite or dire portent, Of its own arduous fulness reverent: Carve it in ivory or in ebony, As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see Its flowering crest impearled and orient. A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals The soul,—its converse, to what Power 'tis due:— Whether for tribute to the august appeals Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue, It serve; or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath, In Charon's palm it pay the toll to Death. Part I.—YOUTH AND CHANGE SONNET I LOVE ENTHRONED I marked all kindred Powers the heart finds fair:— Truth, with awed lips; and Hope, with eyes upcast; And Fame, whose loud wings fan the ashen Past To signal-fires, Oblivion's flight to scare; And Youth, with still some single golden hair Unto his shoulder clinging, since the last Embrace wherein two sweet arms held him fast; And Life, still wreathing flowers for Death to wear. Love's throne was not with these; but far above All passionate wind of welcome and farewell He sat in breathless bowers they dream not of; Though Truth foreknow Love's heart, and Hope foretell, And Fame be for Love's sake desirable, And Youth be dear, and Life be sweet to Love. SONNET II BRIDAL BIRTH As when desire, long darkling, dawns, and first The mother looks upon the newborn child, Even so my Lady stood at gaze and smiled When her soul knew at length the Love it nurs'd. Born with her life, creature of poignant thirst And exquisite hunger, at her heart Love lay Quickening in darkness, till a voice that day Cried on him, and the bonds of birth were burst. Now, shadowed by his wings, our faces yearn Together, as his full-grown feet now range The grove, and his warm hands our couch prepare: Till to his song our bodiless souls in turn Be born his children, when Death's nuptial change Leaves us for light the halo of his hair. SONNET III LOVE'S TESTAMENT O thou who at Love's hour ecstatically Unto my heart dost evermore present, Clothed with his fire, thy heart his testament; Whom I have neared and felt thy breath to be The inmost incense of his sanctuary; Who without speech hast owned him, and, intent Upon his will, thy life with mine hast blent, And murmured, “I am thine, thou'rt one with me!’ O what from thee the grace, to me the prize, And what to Love the glory,—when the whole Of the deep stair thou tread'st to the dim shoal And weary water of the place of sighs, And there dost work deliverance, as thine eyes Draw up my prisoned spirit to thy soul! SONNET IV LOVESIGHT When do I see thee most, beloved one? When in the light the spirits of mine eyes Before thy face, their altar, solemnize The worship of that Love through thee made known? Or when in the dusk hours, (we two alone,) Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies, And my soul only sees thy soul its own? O love, my love! if I no more should see Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee, Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,— How then should sound upon Life's darkening slope The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope, The wind of Death's imperishable wing? SONNET V HEART'S HOPE By what word's power, the key of paths untrod, Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore, Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore Even as that sea which Israel crossed dryshod? For lo! in some poor rhythmic period, Lady, I fain would tell how evermore Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor Thee from myself, neither our love from God. Yea, in God's name, and Love's, and thine, would I Draw from one loving heart such evidence As to all hearts all things shall signify; Tender as dawn's first hill-fire, and intense As instantaneous penetrating sense, In Spring's birth-hour, of other Springs gone by. SONNET VI THE KISS What smouldering senses in death's sick delay Or seizure of malign vicissitude Can rob this body of honour, or denude This soul of wedding-raiment worn to-day? For lo! even now my lady's lips did play With these my lips such consonant interlude As laurelled Orpheus longed for when he wooed The half-drawn hungering face with that last lay. I was a child beneath her touch,—a man When breast to breast we clung, even I and she,— A spirit when her spirit looked through me,— A god when all our life-breath met to fan Our life-blood, till love's emulous ardours ran, Fire within fire, desire in deity. SONNET VIa NUPTIAL SLEEP At length their long kiss severed, with sweet smart: And as the last slow sudden drops are shed From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled, So singly flagged the pulses of each heart. Their bosoms sundered, with the opening start Of married flowers to either side outspread From the knit stem; yet still their mouths, burnt red, Fawned on each other where they lay apart. Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams, And their dreams watched them sink, and slid away. Slowly their souls swam up again, through gleams Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day; Till from some wonder of new woods and streams He woke, and wondered more: for there she lay. SONNET VII SUPREME SURRENDER To all the spirits of Love that wander by Along his love-sown harvest-field of sleep My lady lies apparent; and the deep Calls to the deep; and no man sees but I. The bliss so long afar, at length so nigh, Rests there attained. Methinks proud Love must weep When Fate's control doth from his harvest reap The sacred hour for which the years did sigh. First touched, the hand now warm around my neck Taught memory long to mock desire: and lo! Across my breast the abandoned hair doth flow, Where one shorn tress long stirred the longing ache: And next the heart that trembled for its sake Lies the queen-heart in sovereign overthrow. SONNET VIII LOVE'S LOVERS Some ladies love the jewels in Love's zone, And gold-tipped darts he hath for painless play In idle scornful hours he flings away; And some that listen to his lute's soft tone Do love to vaunt the silver praise their own; Some prize his blindfold sight; and there be they Who kissed his wings which brought him yesterday And thank his wings to-day that he is flown. My lady only loves the heart of Love: Therefore Love's heart, my lady, hath for thee His bower of unimagined flower and tree: There kneels he now, and all-anhungered of Thine eyes grey-lit in shadowing hair above, Seals with thy mouth his immortality. SONET IX PASSION AND WORSHIP One flame-winged brought a white-winged harp-player Even where my lady and I lay all alone; Saying: “Behold, this minstrel is unknown; Bid him depart, for I am minstrel here: Only my strains are to Love's dear ones dear.” Then said I: “Through thine hautboy's rapturous tone Unto my lady still this harp makes moan, And still she deems the cadence deep and clear.” Then said my lady: “Thou art Passion of Love, And this Love's Worship: both he plights to me. Thy mastering music walks the sunlit sea: But where wan water trembles in the grove And the wan moon is all the light thereof, This harp still makes my name its voluntary.” SONNET X THE PORTRAIT O Lord of all compassionate control, O Love! let this my lady's picture glow Under my hand to praise her name, and show Even of her inner self the perfect whole: That he who seeks her beauty's furthest goal, Beyond the light that the sweet glances throw And refluent wave of the sweet smile, may know The very sky and sea-line of her soul. Lo! it is done. Above the enthroning throat The mouth's mould testifies of voice and kiss, The shadowed eyes remember and foresee. Her face is made her shrine. Let all men note That in all years (O Love, thy gift is this!) They that would look on her must come to me. SONNET XI THE LOVE-LETTER Warmed by her hand and shadowed by her hair As close she leaned and poured her heart through thee, Whereof the articulate throbs accompany The smooth black stream that makes thy whiteness fair,— Sweet fluttering sheet, even of her breath aware,— Oh let thy silent song disclose to me That soul wherewith her lips and eyes agree Like married music in Love's answering air. Fain had I watched her when, at some fond thought, Her bosom to the writing closelier press'd, And her breast's secrets peered into her breast; When, through eyes raised an instant, her soul sought My soul, and from the sudden confluence caught The words that made her love the loveliest. SONNET XII THE LOVERS' WALK Sweet twining hedgeflowers wind-stirred in no wise On this June day; and hand that clings in hand:— Still glades; and meeting faces scarcely fann'd:— An osier-odoured stream that draws the skies Deep to its heart; and mirrored eyes in eyes:— Fresh hourly wonder o'er the Summer land Of light and cloud; and two souls softly spann'd With one o'erarching heaven of smiles and sighs:— Even such their path, whose bodies lean unto Each other's visible sweetness amorously,— Whose passionate hearts lean by Love's high decree Together on his heart for ever true, As the cloud-foaming firmamental blue Rests on the blue line of a foamless sea. SONNET XIII YOUTH'S ANTIPHONY “I love you, sweet: how can you ever learn How much I love you?” “You I love even so, And so I learn it.” “Sweet, you cannot know How fair you are.” “If fair enough to earn Your love, so much is all my love's concern.” “My love grows hourly, sweet.” “Mine too doth grow, Yet love seemed full so many hours ago!” Thus lovers speak, till kisses claim their turn. Ah! happy they to whom such words as these In youth have served for speech the whole day long, Hour after hour, remote from the world's throng, Work, contest, fame, all life's confederate pleas,— What while Love breathed in sighs and silences Through two blent souls one rapturous undersong. SONNET XIV YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE On this sweet bank your head thrice sweet and dear I lay, and spread your hair on either side, And see the newborn woodflowers bashful-eyed Look through the golden tresses here and there. On these debateable borders of the year Spring's foot half falters; scarce she yet may know The leafless blackthorn-blossom from the snow; And through her bowers the wind's way still is clear. But April's sun strikes down the glades to-day; So shut your eyes upturned, and feel my kiss Creep, as the Spring now thrills through every spray, Up your warm throat to your warm lips: for this Is even the hour of Love's sworn suitservice, With whom cold hearts are counted castaway. SONNET XV THE BIRTH-BOND Have you not noted, in some family Where two were born of a first marriage-bed, How still they own their gracious bond, though fed And nursed on the forgotten breast and knee?— How to their father's children they shall be In act and thought of one goodwill; but each Shall for the other have, in silence speech, And in a word complete community? Even so, when first I saw you, seemed it, love, That among souls allied to mine was yet One nearer kindred than life hinted of. O born with me somewhere that men forget, And though in years of sight and sound unmet, Known for my soul's birth-partner well enough! SONNET XVI A DAY OF LOVE Those envied places which do know her well, And are so scornful of this lonely place, Even now for once are emptied of her grace: Nowhere but here she is: and while Love's spell From his predominant presence doth compel All alien hours, an outworn populace, The hours of Love fill full the echoing space With sweet confederate music favourable. Now many memories make solicitous The delicate love-lines of her mouth, till, lit With quivering fire, the words take wing from it; As here between our kisses we sit thus Speaking of things remembered, and so sit Speechless while things forgotten call to us. SONNET XVII BEAUTY'S PAGEANT What dawn-pulse at the heart of heaven, or last Incarnate flower of culminating day,— What marshalled marvels on the skirts of May, Or song full-quired, sweet June's encomiast; What glory of change by Nature's hand amass'd Can vie with all those moods of varying grace Which o'er one loveliest woman's form and face Within this hour, within this room, have pass'd? Love's very vesture and elect disguise Was each fine movement,—wonder new-begot Of lily or swan or swan-stemmed galiot; Joy to his sight who now the sadlier sighs, Parted again; and sorrow yet for eyes Unborn, that read these words and saw her not. SONNET XVIII GENIUS IN BEAUTY Beauty like hers is genius. Not the call Of Homer's or of Dante's heart sublime,— Not Michael's hand furrowing the zones of time,— Is more with compassed mysteries musical; Nay, not in Spring's or Summer's sweet footfall More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeaths Than doth this sovereign face, whose love-spell breathes Even from its shadowed contour on the wall. As many men are poets in their youth, But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong Even through all change the indomitable song; So in like wise the envenomed years, whose tooth Rends shallower grace with ruin void of ruth, Upon this beauty's power shall wreak no wrong. SONNET XIX SILENT NOON Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,— The finger-points look through like rosy blooms: Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms 'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass. All round our nest, far as the eye can pass, Are golden kingcup-fields with silver edge Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge. 'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass. Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:— So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above. Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower, This close-companioned inarticulate hour When twofold silence was the song of love. SONNET XX GRACIOUS MOONLIGHT Even as the moon grows queenlier in mid-space When the sky darkens, and her cloud-rapt car Thrills with intenser radiance from afar,— So lambent, lady, beams thy sovereign grace When the drear soul desires thee. Of that face What shall be said,—which, like a governing star, Gathers and garners from all things that are Their silent penetrative loveliness? O'er water-daisies and wild waifs of Spring, There where the iris rears its gold-crowned sheaf With flowering rush and sceptred arrow-leaf, So have I marked Queen Dian, in bright ring Of cloud above and wave below, take wing And chase night's gloom, as thou the spirit's grief. SONNET XXI LOVE-SWEETNESS Sweet dimness of her loosened hair's downfall About thy face; her sweet hands round thy head In gracious fostering union garlanded; Her tremulous smiles; her glances' sweet recall Of love; her murmuring sighs memorial; Her mouth's culled sweetness by thy kisses shed On cheeks and neck and eyelids, and so led Back to her mouth which answers there for all:— What sweeter than these things, except the thing In lacking which all these would lose their sweet:— The confident heart's still fervour: the swift beat And soft subsidence of the spirit's wing, Then when it feels, in cloud-girt wayfaring, The breath of kindred plumes against its feet? SONNET XXII HEART'S HAVEN Sometimes she is a child within mine arms, Cowering beneath dark wings that love must chase,— With still tears showering and averted face, Inexplicably filled with faint alarms: And oft from mine own spirit's hurtling harms I crave the refuge of her deep embrace,— Against all ills the fortified strong place And sweet reserve of sovereign counter-charms. And Love, our light at night and shade at noon, Lulls us to rest with songs, and turns away All shafts of shelterless tumultuous day. Like the moon's growth, his face gleams through his tune; And as soft waters warble to the moon, Our answering spirits chime one roundelay. SONNET XXIII LOVE'S BAUBLES I stood where Love in brimming armfuls bore Slight wanton flowers and foolish toys of fruit: And round him ladies thronged in warm pursuit, Fingered and lipped and proffered the strange store. And from one hand the petal and the core Savoured of sleep; and cluster and curled shoot Seemed from another hand like shame's salute,— Gifts that I felt my cheek was blushing for. At last Love bade my Lady give the same: And as I looked, the dew was light thereon; And as I took them, at her touch they shone With inmost heaven-hue of the heart of flame. And then Love said: “Lo! when the hand is hers, Follies of love are love's true ministers.” SONNET XXIV PRIDE OF YOUTH Even as a child, of sorrow that we give The dead, but little in his heart can find, Since without need of thought to his clear mind Their turn it is to die and his to live:— Even so the winged New Love smiles to receive Along his eddying plumes the auroral wind, Nor, forward glorying, casts one look behind Where night-rack shrouds the Old Love fugitive. There is a change in every hour's recall, And the last cowslip in the fields we see On the same day with the first corn-poppy. Alas for hourly change! Alas for all The loves that from his hand proud Youth lets fall, Even as the beads of a told rosary! SONNET XXV WINGED HOURS Each hour until we meet is as a bird That wings from far his gradual way along The rustling covert of my soul,—his song Still loudlier trilled through leaves more deeply stirr'd: But at the hour of meeting, a clear word Is every note he sings, in Love's own tongue; Yet, Love, thou know'st the sweet strain suffers wrong Full oft through our contending joys unheard. What of that hour at last, when for her sake No wing may fly to me nor song may flow; When, wandering round my life unleaved, I know The bloodied feathers scattered in the brake, And think how she, far from me, with like eyes Sees through the untuneful bough the wingless skies? SONNET XXVI MID-RAPTURE Thou lovely and beloved, thou my love; Whose kiss seems still the first; whose summoning eyes, Even now, as for our love-world's new sunrise, Shed very dawn; whose voice, attuned above All modulation of the deep-bowered dove, Is like a hand laid softly on the soul; Whose hand is like a sweet voice to control Those worn tired brows it hath the keeping of:— What word can answer to thy word,—what gaze To thine, which now absorbs within its sphere My worshipping face, till I am mirrored there Light-circled in a heaven of deep-drawn rays? What clasp, what kiss mine inmost heart can prove, O lovely and beloved, O my love? SONNET XXVII HEART'S COMPASS Sometimes thou seem'st not as thyself alone, But as the meaning of all things that are; A breathless wonder, shadowing forth afar Some heavenly solstice hushed and halcyon; Whose unstirred lips are music's visible tone; Whose eyes the sun-gate of the soul unbar, Being of its furthest fires oracular;— The evident heart of all life sown and mown. Even such Love is; and is not thy name Love? Yea, by thy hand the Love-god rends apart All gathering clouds of Night's ambiguous art; Flings them far down, and sets thine eyes above; And simply, as some gage of flower or glove, Stakes with a smile the world against thy heart. SONNET XXVIII SOUL-LIGHT What other woman could be loved like you, Or how of you should love possess his fill? After the fulness of all rapture, still,— As at the end of some deep avenue A tender glamour of day,—there comes to view Far in your eyes a yet more hungering thrill,— Such fire as Love's soul-winnowing hands distil Even from his inmost ark of light and dew. And as the traveller triumphs with the sun, Glorying in heat's mid-height, yet startide brings Wonder new-born, and still fresh transport springs From limpid lambent hours of day begun;— Even so, through eyes and voice, your soul doth move My soul with changeful light of infinite love. SONNET XXIX THE MOONSTAR Lady, I thank thee for thy loveliness, Because my lady is more lovely still. Glorying I gaze, and yield with glad goodwill To thee thy tribute; by whose sweet-spun dress Of delicate life Love labours to assess My lady's absolute queendom; saying, “Lo! How high this beauty is, which yet doth show But as that beauty's sovereign votaress.” Lady, I saw thee with her, side by side; And as, when night's fair fires their queen surround, An emulous star too near the moon will ride,— Even so thy rays within her luminous bound Were traced no more; and by the light so drown'd, Lady, not thou but she was glorified. SONNET XXX LAST FIRE Love, through your spirit and mine what summer eve Now glows with glory of all things possess'd, Since this day's sun of rapture filled the west And the light sweetened as the fire took leave? Awhile now softlier let your bosom heave, As in Love's harbour, even that loving breast, All care takes refuge while we sink to rest, And mutual dreams the bygone bliss retrieve. Many the days that Winter keeps in store, Sunless throughout, or whose brief sun-glimpses Scarce shed the heaped snow through the naked trees, This day at least was Summer's paramour, Sun-coloured to the imperishable core With sweet well-being of love and full heart's ease. SONNET XXXI HER GIFTS High grace, the dower of queens; and therewithal Some wood-born wonder's sweet simplicity; A glance like water brimming with the sky Or hyacinth-light where forest-shadows fall; Such thrilling pallor of cheek as doth enthral The heart; a mouth whose passionate forms imply All music and all silence held thereby; Deep golden locks, her sovereign coronal; A round reared neck, meet column of Love's shrine To cling to when the heart takes sanctuary; Hands which for ever at Love's bidding be, And soft-stirred feet still answering to his sign:— These are her gifts, as tongue may tell them o'er. Breathe low her name, my soul; for that means more. SONNET XXXII EQUAL TROTH Not by one measure mayst thou mete our love; For how should I be loved as I love thee?— I, graceless, joyless, lacking absolutely All gifts that with thy queenship best behove;— Thou, throned in every heart's elect alcove, And crowned with garlands culled from every tree, Which for no head but thine, by Love's decree, All beauties and all mysteries interwove. But here thine eyes and lips yield soft rebuke:— “Then only” (say'st thou) “could I love thee less, When thou couldst doubt my love's equality.” Peace, sweet! If not to sum but worth we look,— Thy heart's transcendence, not my heart's excess,— Then more a thousandfold thou lov'st than I. SONNET XXXIII VENUS VICTRIX Could Juno's self more sovereign presence wear Than thou, 'mid other ladies throned in grace?— Or Pallas, when thou bend'st with soul-stilled face O'er poet's page gold-shadowed in thy hair? Dost thou than Venus seem less heavenly fair When o'er the sea of love's tumultuous trance Hovers thy smile, and mingles with thy glance That sweet voice like the last wave murmuring there? Before such triune loveliness divine Awestruck I ask, which goddess here most claims The prize that, howsoe'er adjudged, is thine? Then Love breathes low the sweetest of thy names; And Venus Victrix to my heart doth bring Herself, the Helen of her guerdoning. SONNET XXXIV THE DARK GLASS Not I myself know all my love for thee: How should I reach so far, who cannot weigh To-morrow's dower by gage of yesterday? Shall birth and death, and all dark names that be As doors and windows bared to some loud sea, Lash deaf mine ears and blind my face with spray; And shall my sense pierce love,—the last relay And ultimate outpost of eternity? Lo! what am I to Love, the lord of all? One murmuring shell he gathers from the sand,— One little heart-flame sheltered in his hand. Yet through thine eyes he grants me clearest call And veriest touch of powers primordial That any hour-girt life may understand. SONNET XXXV THE LAMP'S SHRINE Sometimes I fain would find in thee some fault, That I might love thee still in spite of it: Yet how should our Lord Love curtail one whit Thy perfect praise whom most he would exalt? Alas! he can but make my heart's low vault Even in men's sight unworthier, being lit By thee, who thereby show'st more exquisite Like fiery chrysoprase in deep basalt. Yet will I nowise shrink; but at Love's shrine Myself within the beams his brow doth dart Will set the flashing jewel of thy heart In that dull chamber where it deigns to shine: For lo! in honour of thine excellencies My heart takes pride to show how poor it is. SONNET XXXVI LIFE-IN-LOVE Not in thy body is thy life at all, But in this lady's lips and hands and eyes; Through these she yields thee life that vivifies What else were sorrow's servant and death's thrall. Look on thyself without her, and recall The waste remembrance and forlorn surmise That lived but in a dead-drawn breath of sighs O'er vanished hours and hours eventual. Even so much life hath the poor tress of hair Which, stored apart, is all love hath to show For heart-beats and for fire-heats long ago; Even so much life endures unknown, even where, 'Mid change the changeless night environeth, Lies all that golden hair undimmed in death. SONNET XXXVII THE LOVE-MOON “When that dead face, bowered in the furthest years, Which once was all the life years held for thee, Can now scarce bid the tides of memory Cast on thy soul a little spray of tears,— How canst thou gaze into these eyes of hers Whom now thy heart delights in, and not see Within each orb Love's philtred euphrasy Make them of buried troth remembrancers?” “Nay, pitiful Love, nay, loving Pity! Well Thou knowest that in these twain I have confess'd Two very voices of thy summoning bell. Nay, Master, shall not Death make manifest In these the culminant changes which approve The love-moon that must light my soul to Love?” SONNET XXXVIII THE MORROW'S MESSAGE “Thou Ghost,” I said, “and is thy name To-day?— Yesterday's son, with such an abject brow!— And can To-morrow be more pale than thou?” While yet I spoke, the silence answered: “Yea, Henceforth our issue is all grieved and grey, And each beforehand makes such poor avow As of old leaves beneath the budding bough Or night-drift that the sundawn shreds away.” Then cried I: “Mother of many malisons, O Earth, receive me to thy dusty bed!” But therewithal the tremulous silence said: “Lo! Love yet bids thy lady greet thee once:— Yea, twice,—whereby thy life is still the sun's; And thrice,—whereby the shadow of death is dead.” SONNET XXXIX SLEEPLESS DREAMS Girt in dark growths, yet glimmering with one star, O night desirous as the nights of youth! Why should my heart within thy spell, forsooth, Now beat, as the bride's finger-pulses are Quickened within the girdling golden bar? What wings are these that fan my pillow smooth? And why does Sleep, waved back by Joy and Ruth, Tread softly round and gaze at me from far? Nay, night deep-leaved! And would Love feign in thee Some shadowy palpitating grove that bears Rest for man's eyes and music for his ears? O lonely night! art thou not known to me, A thicket hung with masks of mockery And watered with the wasteful warmth of tears? SONNET XL SEVERED SELVES Two separate divided silences, Which, brought together, would find loving voice; Two glances which together would rejoice In love, now lost like stars beyond dark trees; Two hands apart whose touch alone gives ease; Two bosoms which, heart-shrined with mutual flame, Would, meeting in one clasp, be made the same; Two souls, the shores wave-mocked of sundering seas:— Such are we now. Ah! may our hope forecast Indeed one hour again, when on this stream Of darkened love once more the light shall gleam?— An hour how slow to come, how quickly past,— Which blooms and fades, and only leaves at last, Faint as shed flowers, the attenuated dream. SONNET XLI THROUGH DEATH TO LOVE Like labour-laden moonclouds faint to flee From winds that sweep the winter-bitten wold,— Like multiform circumfluence manifold Of night's flood-tide,—like terrors that agree Of hoarse-tongued fire and inarticulate sea,— Even such, within some glass dimmed by our breath, Our hearts discern wild images of Death, Shadows and shoals that edge eternity. Howbeit athwart Death's imminent shade doth soar One Power, than flow of stream or flight of dove Sweeter to glide around, to brood above. Tell me, my heart,—what angel-greeted door Or threshold of wing-winnowed threshing-floor Hath guest fire-fledged as thine, whose lord is Love? SONNET XLII HOPE OVERTAKEN I deemed thy garments, O my Hope, were grey, So far I viewed thee. Now the space between Is passed at length; and garmented in green Even as in days of yore thou stand'st to-day. Ah God! and but for lingering dull dismay, On all that road our footsteps erst had been Even thus commingled, and our shadows seen Blent on the hedgerows and the water-way. O Hope of mine whose eyes are living love, No eyes but hers,—O Love and Hope the same!— Lean close to me, for now the sinking sun That warmed our feet scarce gilds our hair above. O hers thy voice and very hers thy name! Alas, cling round me, for the day is done! SONNET XLIII LOVE AND HOPE Bless love and hope. Full many a withered year Whirled past us, eddying to its chill doomsday; And clasped together where the blown leaves lay We long have knelt and wept full many a tear. Yet lo! one hour at last, the Spring's compeer, Flutes softly to us from some green byeway: Those years, those tears are dead, but only they:— Bless love and hope, true soul; for we are here. Cling heart to heart; nor of this hour demand Whether in very truth, when we are dead, Our hearts shall wake to know Love's golden head Sole sunshine of the imperishable land; Or but discern, through night's unfeatured scope, Scorn-fired at length the illusive eyes of Hope. SONNET XLIV CLOUD AND WIND Love, should I fear death most for you or me? Yet if you die, can I not follow you, Forcing the straits of change? Alas! but who Shall wrest a bond from night's inveteracy, Ere yet my hazardous soul put forth, to be Her warrant against all her haste might rue?— Ah! in your eyes so reached what dumb adieu, What unsunned gyres of waste eternity? And if I die the first, shall death be then A lampless watchtower whence I see you weep?— Or (woe is me!) a bed wherein my sleep Ne'er notes (as death's dear cup at last you drain), The hour when you too learn that all is vain And that Hope sows what Love shall never reap? SONNET XLV SECRET PARTING Because our talk was of the cloud-control And moon-track of the journeying face of Fate, Her tremulous kisses faltered at love's gate And her eyes dreamed against a distant goal: But soon, remembering her how brief the whole Of joy, which its own hours annihilate, Her set gaze gathered, thirstier than of late, And as she kissed, her mouth became her soul. Thence in what ways we wandered, and how strove To build with fire-tried vows the piteous home Which memory haunts and whither sleep may roam,— They only know for whom the roof of Love Is the still-seated secret of the grove, Nor spire may rise nor bell be heard therefrom. SONNET XLVI PARTED LOVE What shall be said of this embattled day And arméd occupation of this night By all thy foes beleaguered,—now when sight Nor sound denotes the loved one far away? Of these thy vanquished hours what shalt thou say,— As every sense to which she dealt delight Now labours lonely o'er the stark noon-height To reach the sunset's desolate disarray? Stand still, fond fettered wretch! while Memory's art Parades the Past before thy face, and lures Thy spirit to her passionate portraitures: Till the tempestuous tide-gates flung apart Flood with wild will the hollows of thy heart, And thy heart rends thee, and thy body endures. SONNET XLVII BROKEN MUSIC The mother will not turn, who thinks she hears Her nursling's speech first grow articulate; But breathless with averted eyes elate She sits, with open lips and open ears, That it may call her twice. 'Mid doubts and fears Thus oft my soul has hearkened; till the song, A central moan for days, at length found tongue, And the sweet music welled and the sweet tears. But now, whatever while the soul is fain To list that wonted murmur, as it were The speech-bound sea-shell's low importunate strain,— No breath of song, thy voice alone is there, O bitterly beloved! and all her gain Is but the pang of unpermitted prayer. SONNET XLVIII DEATH-IN-LOVE There came an image in Life's retinue That had Love's wings and bore his gonfalon: Fair was the web, and nobly wrought thereon, O soul-sequestered face, thy form and hue! Bewildering sounds, such as Spring wakens to, Shook in its folds; and through my heart its power Sped trackless as the immemorable hour When birth's dark portal groaned and all was new. But a veiled woman followed, and she caught The banner round its staff, to furl and cling,— Then plucked a feather from the bearer's wing And held it to his lips that stirred it not, And said to me, “Behold, there is no breath: I and this Love are one, and I am Death.” SONNETS XLIX, L, LI, LII WILLOWWOOD I I sat with Love upon a woodside well, Leaning across the water, I and he; Nor ever did he speak nor looked at me, But touched his lute wherein was audible The certain secret thing he had to tell: Only our mirrored eyes met silently In the low wave; and that sound came to be The passionate voice I knew; and my tears fell. And at their fall, his eyes beneath grew hers; And with his foot and with his wing-feathers He swept the spring that watered my heart's drouth. Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair, And as I stooped, her own lips rising there Bubbled with brimming kisses at my mouth. II And now Love sang: but his was such a song, So meshed with half-remembrance hard to free, As souls disused in death's sterility May sing when the new birthday tarries long. And I was made aware of a dumb throng That stood aloof, one form by every tree, All mournful forms, for each was I or she, The shades of those our days that had no tongue. They looked on us, and knew us and were known; While fast together, alive from the abyss, Clung the soul-wrung implacable close kiss; And pity of self through all made broken moan Which said “For once, for once, for once alone!” And still Love sang, and what he sang was this:— III “O ye, all ye that walk in Willowwood, That walk with hollow faces burning white; What fathom-depth of soul-struck widowhood, What long, what longer hours, one lifelong night, Ere ye again, who so in vain have wooed Your last hope lost, who so in vain invite Your lips to that their unforgotten food, Ere ye, ere ye again shall see the light! Alas! the bitter banks in Willowwood, With tear-spurge wan, with blood-wort burning red: Alas! if ever such a pillow could Steep deep the soul in sleep till she were dead,— Better all life forget her than this thing, That Willowwood should hold her wandering!” IV So sang he: and as meeting rose and rose Together cling through the wind's wellaway Nor change at once, yet near the end of day The leaves drop loosened where the heart-stain glows,— So when the song died did the kiss unclose; And her face fell back drowned, and was as grey As its grey eyes; and if it ever may Meet mine again I know not if Love knows. Only I know that I leaned low and drank A long draught from the water where she sank, Her breath and all her tears and all her soul: And as I leaned, I know I felt Love's face Pressed on my neck with moan of pity and grace, Till both our heads were in his aureole. SONNET LIII WITHOUT HER What of her glass without her? The blank grey There where the pool is blind of the moon's face. Her dress without her? The tossed empty space Of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away. Her paths without her? Day's appointed sway Usurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place Without her? Tears, ah me! for love's good grace, And cold forgetfulness of night or day. What of the heart without her? Nay, poor heart, Of thee what word remains ere speech be still? A wayfarer by barren ways and chill, Steep ways and weary, without her thou art, Where the long cloud, the long wood's counterpart, Sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill. SONNET LIV LOVE'S FATALITY Sweet Love,—but oh! most dread Desire of Love Life-thwarted. Linked in gyves I saw them stand, Love shackled with Vain-longing, hand to hand: And one was eyed as the blue vault above: But hope tempestuous like a fire-cloud hove I' the other's gaze, even as in his whose wand Vainly all night with spell-wrought power has spann'd The unyielding caves of some deep treasure-trove. Also his lips, two writhen flakes of flame, Made moan: “Alas O Love, thus leashed with me! Wing-footed thou, wing-shouldered, once born free: And I, thy cowering self, in chains grown tame,— Bound to thy body and soul, named with thy name,— Life's iron heart, even Love's Fatality.” SONNET LV STILLBORN LOVE The hour which might have been yet might not be, Which man's and woman's heart conceived and bore Yet whereof life was barren,—on what shore Bides it the breaking of Time's weary sea? Bondchild of all consummate joys set free, It somewhere sighs and serves, and mute before The house of Love, hears through the echoing door His hours elect in choral consonancy. But lo! what wedded souls now hand in hand Together tread at last the immortal strand With eyes where burning memory lights love home? Lo! how the little outcast hour has turned And leaped to them and in their faces yearned:— “I am your child: O parents, ye have come!” SONNETS LVI, LVII, LVIII TRUE WOMAN I. HERSELF To be a sweetness more desired than Spring; A bodily beauty more acceptable Than the wild rose-tree's arch that crowns the fell; To be an essence more environing Than wine's drained juice; a music ravishing More than the passionate pulse of Philomel;— To be all this 'neath one soft bosom's swell That is the flower of life:—how strange a thing! How strange a thing to be what Man can know But as a sacred secret! Heaven's own screen Hides her soul's purest depth and loveliest glow; Closely withheld, as all things most unseen,— The wave-bowered pearl,—the heart-shaped seal of green That flecks the snowdrop underneath the snow. II. HER LOVE She loves him; for her infinite soul is Love, And he her lodestar. Passion in her is A glass facing his fire, where the bright bliss Is mirrored, and the heat returned. Yet move That glass, a stranger's amorous flame to prove, And it shall turn, by instant contraries, Ice to the moon; while her pure fire to his For whom it burns, clings close i' the heart's alcove. Lo! they are one. With wifely breast to breast And circling arms, she welcomes all command Of love,—her soul to answering ardours fann'd: Yet as morn springs or twilight sinks to rest, Ah! who shall say she deems not loveliest The hour of sisterly sweet hand-in-hand? III. HER HEAVEN If to grow old in Heaven is to grow young, (As the Seer saw and said,) then blest were he With youth for evermore, whose heaven should be True Woman, she whom these weak notes have sung. Here and hereafter,—choir-strains of her tongue,— Sky-spaces of her eyes,—sweet signs that flee About her soul's immediate sanctuary,— Were Paradise all uttermost worlds among. The sunrise blooms and withers on the hill Like any hillflower; and the noblest troth Dies here to dust. Yet shall Heaven's promise clothe Even yet those lovers who have cherished still This test for love:—in every kiss sealed fast To feel the first kiss and forebode the last. SONNET LIX LOVE'S LAST GIFT Love to his singer held a glistening leaf, And said: “The rose-tree and the apple-tree Have fruits to vaunt or flowers to lure the bee; And golden shafts are in the feathered sheaf Of the great harvest-marshal, the year's chief, Victorious Summer; aye, and 'neath warm sea Strange secret grasses lurk inviolably Between the filtering channels of sunk reef. “All are my blooms; and all sweet blooms of love To thee I gave while Spring and Summer sang; But Autumn stops to listen, with some pang From those worse things the wind is moaning of. Only this laurel dreads no winter days: Take my last gift; thy heart hath sung my praise.” Part II.—CHANGE AND FATE SONNET LX TRANSFIGURED LIFE As growth of form or momentary glance In a child's features will recall to mind The father's with the mother's face combin'd,— Sweet interchange that memories still enhance: And yet, as childhood's years and youth's advance, The gradual mouldings leave one stamp behind, Till in the blended likeness now we find A separate man's or woman's countenance:— So in the Song, the singer's Joy and Pain, Its very parents, evermore expand To bid the passion's fullgrown birth remain, By Art's transfiguring essence subtly spann'd; And from that song-cloud shaped as a man's hand There comes the sound as of abundant rain. SONNET LXI THE SONG-THROE By thine own tears thy song must tears beget, O Singer! Magic mirror thou hast none Except thy manifest heart; and save thine own Anguish or ardour, else no amulet. Cisterned in Pride, verse is the feathery jet Of soulless air-flung fountains; nay, more dry Than the Dead Sea for throats that thirst and sigh, That song o'er which no singer's lids grew wet. The Song-god—He the Sun-god—is no slave Of thine: thy Hunter he, who for thy soul Fledges his shaft: to no august control Of thy skilled hand his quivered store he gave: But if thy lips' loud cry leap to his smart, The inspir'd recoil shall pierce thy brother's heart. SONNET LXII THE SOUL'S SPHERE Some prisoned moon in steep cloud-fastnesses,— Throned queen and thralled; some dying sun whose pyre Blazed with momentous memorable fire;— Who hath not yearned and fed his heart with these? Who, sleepless, hath not anguished to appease Tragical shadow's realm of sound and sight Conjectured in the lamentable night? ... Lo! the soul's sphere of infinite images! What sense shall count them? Whether it forecast The rose-winged hours that flutter in the van Of Love's unquestioning unrevealèd span,— Visions of golden futures: or that last Wild pageant of the accumulated past That clangs and flashes for a drowning man. SONNET LXIII INCLUSIVENESS The changing guests, each in a different mood, Sit at the roadside table and arise: And every life among them in like wise Is a soul's board set daily with new food. What man has bent o'er his son's sleep, to brood How that face shall watch his when cold it lies?— Or thought, as his own mother kissed his eyes, Of what her kiss was when his father wooed? May not this ancient room thou sitt'st in dwell In separate living souls for joy or pain? Nay, all its corners may be painted plain Where Heaven shows pictures of some life spent well; And may be stamped, a memory all in vain, Upon the sight of lidless eyes in Hell. SONNET LXIV ARDOUR AND MEMORY The cuckoo-throb, the heartbeat of the Spring; The rosebud's blush that leaves it as it grows Into the full-eyed fair unblushing rose; The summer clouds that visit every wing With fires of sunrise and of sunsetting; The furtive flickering streams to light re-born 'Mid airs new-fledged and valorous lusts of morn, While all the daughters of the daybreak sing:— These ardour loves, and memory: and when flown All joys, and through dark forest-boughs in flight The wind swoops onward brandishing the light, Even yet the rose-tree's verdure left alone Will flush all ruddy though the rose be gone; With ditties and with dirges infinite. SONNET LXV KNOWN IN VAIN As two whose love, first foolish, widening scope, Knows suddenly, to music high and soft, The Holy of holies; who because they scoff'd Are now amazed with shame, nor dare to cope With the whole truth aloud, lest heaven should ope; Yet, at their meetings, laugh not as they laugh'd In speech; nor speak, at length; but sitting oft Together, within hopeless sight of hope For hours are silent:—So it happeneth When Work and Will awake too late, to gaze After their life sailed by, and hold their breath. Ah! who shall dare to search through what sad maze Thenceforth their incommunicable ways Follow the desultory feet of Death? SONNET LXVI THE HEART OF THE NIGHT From child to youth; from youth to arduous man; From lethargy to fever of the heart; From faithful life to dream-dowered days apart; From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;— Thus much of change in one swift cycle ran Till now. Alas, the soul!—how soon must she Accept her primal immortality,— The flesh resume its dust whence it began? O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life! O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late, Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath: That when the peace is garnered in from strife, The work retrieved, the will regenerate, This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death! SONNET LXVII THE LANDMARK Was that the landmark? What,—the foolish well Whose wave, low down, I did not stoop to drink, But sat and flung the pebbles from its brink In sport to send its imaged skies pell-mell, (And mine own image, had I noted well!)— Was that my point of turning?—I had thought The stations of my course should rise unsought, As altar-stone or ensigned citadel. But lo! the path is missed, I must go back, And thirst to drink when next I reach the spring Which once I stained, which since may have grown black. Yet though no light be left nor bird now sing As here I turn, I'll thank God, hastening, That the same goal is still on the same track. SONNET LXVIII A DARK DAY The gloom that breathes upon me with these airs Is like the drops which strike the traveller's brow Who knows not, darkling, if they bring him now Fresh storm, or be old rain the covert bears. Ah! bodes this hour some harvest of new tares, Or hath but memory of the day whose plough Sowed hunger once,—the night at length when thou, O prayer found vain, didst fall from out my prayers? How prickly were the growths which yet how smooth, Along the hedgerows of this journey shed, Lie by Time's grace till night and sleep may soothe! Even as the thistledown from pathsides dead Gleaned by a girl in autumns of her youth, Which one new year makes soft her marriage-bed. SONNET LXIX AUTUMN IDLENESS This sunlight shames November where he grieves In dead red leaves, and will not let him shun The day, though bough with bough be over-run. But with a blessing every glade receives High salutation; while from hillock-eaves The deer gaze calling, dappled white and dun, As if, being foresters of old, the sun Had marked them with the shade of forest-leaves. Here dawn to-day unveiled her magic glass; Here noon now gives the thirst and takes the dew; Till eve bring rest when other good things pass. And here the lost hours the lost hours renew While I still lead my shadow o'er the grass, Nor know, for longing, that which I should do. SONNET LXX THE HILL SUMMIT This feast-day of the sun, his altar there In the broad west has blazed for vesper-song; And I have loitered in the vale too long And gaze now a belated worshipper. Yet may I not forget that I was 'ware, So journeying, of his face at intervals Transfigured where the fringed horizon falls,— A fiery bush with coruscating hair. And now that I have climbed and won this height, I must tread downward through the sloping shade And travel the bewildered tracks till night. Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed And see the gold air and the silver fade And the last bird fly into the last light. SONNETS LXXI, LXXII, LXXIII THE CHOICE I Eat thou and drink; to-morrow thou shalt die. Surely the earth, that's wise being very old, Needs not our help. Then loose me, love, and hold Thy sultry hair up from my face; that I May pour for thee this golden wine, brim-high, Till round the glass thy fingers glow like gold. We'll drown all hours: thy song, while hours are toll'd, Shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky. Now kiss, and think that there are really those, My own high-bosomed beauty, who increase Vain gold, vain lore, and yet might choose our way! Through many years they toil; then on a day They die not,—for their life was death,—but cease; And round their narrow lips the mould falls close. II Watch thou and fear; to-morrow thou shalt die. Or art thou sure thou shalt have time for death? Is not the day which God's word promiseth To come man knows not when? In yonder sky, Now while we speak, the sun speeds forth: can I Or thou assure him of his goal? God's breath Even at this moment haply quickeneth The air to a flame; till spirits, always nigh Though screened and hid, shall walk the daylight here. And dost thou prate of all that man shall do? Canst thou, who hast but plagues, presume to be Glad in his gladness that comes after thee? Will his strength slay thy worm in Hell? Go to: Cover thy countenance, and watch, and fear. III Think thou and act; to-morrow thou shalt die. Outstretched in the sun's warmth upon the shore, Thou say'st: “Man's measured path is all gone o'er: Up all his years, steeply, with strain and sigh, Man clomb until he touched the truth; and I, Even I, am he whom it was destined for.” How should this be? Art thou then so much more Than they who sowed, that thou shouldst reap thereby? Nay, come up hither. From this wave-washed mound Unto the furthest flood-brim look with me; Then reach on with thy thought till it be drown'd. Miles and miles distant though the last line be, And though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyond,— Still, leagues beyond those leagues, there is more sea. SONNETS LXXIV, LXXV, LXXVI OLD AND NEW ART I. ST. LUKE THE PAINTER Give honour unto Luke Evangelist; For he it was (the aged legends say) Who first taught Art to fold her hands and pray. Scarcely at once she dared to rend the mist Of devious symbols: but soon having wist How sky-breadth and field-silence and this day Are symbols also in some deeper way, She looked through these to God and was God's priest. And if, past noon, her toil began to irk, And she sought talismans, and turned in vain To soulless self-reflections of man's skill,— Yet now, in this the twilight, she might still Kneel in the latter grass to pray again, Ere the night cometh and she may not work. II. NOT AS THESE “I am not as these are,” the poet saith In youth's pride, and the painter, among men At bay, where never pencil comes nor pen, And shut about with his own frozen breath. To others for whom only rhyme wins faith As poets,—only paint as painters,—then He turns in the cold silence; and again Shrinking, “I am not as these are,” he saith. And say that this is so, what follows it? For were thine eyes set backwards in thine head, Such words were well; but they see on, and far. Unto the lights of the great Past, new-lit Fair for the Future's track, look thou instead, Say thou instead, “I am not as these are.” III. THE HUSBANDMEN Though God, as one that is an householder, Called these to labour in His vineyard first, Before the husk of darkness was well burst Bidding them grope their way out and bestir, (Who, questioned of their wages, answered, “Sir, Unto each man a penny:”) though the worst Burthen of heat was theirs and the dry thirst: Though God has since found none such as these were To do their work like them:—Because of this Stand not ye idle in the market-place. Which of ye knoweth he is not that last Who may be first by faith and will?—yea, his The hand which after the appointed days And hours shall give a Future to their Past? SONNET LXXVII SOUL'S BEAUTY Under the arch of Life, where love and death, Terror and mystery, guard her shrine, I saw Beauty enthroned; and though her gaze struck awe, I drew it in as simply as my breath. Hers are the eyes which, over and beneath, The sky and sea bend on thee,—which can draw, By sea or sky or woman, to one law, The allotted bondman of her palm and wreath. This is that Lady Beauty, in whose praise Thy voice and hand shake still,—long known to thee By flying hair and fluttering hem,—the beat Following her daily of thy heart and feet, How passionately and irretrievably, In what fond flight, how many ways and days! SONNET LXXVIII BODY'S BEAUTY Of Adam's first wife, Lilith, it is told (The witch he loved before the gift of Eve,) That, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive, And her enchanted hair was the first gold. And still she sits, young while the earth is old, And, subtly of herself contemplative, Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave, Till heart and body and life are in its hold. The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent And soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare? Lo! as that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent And round his heart one strangling golden hair. SONNET LXXIX THE MONOCHORD Is it this sky's vast vault or ocean's sound That is Life's self and draws my life from me, And by instinct ineffable decree Holds my breath quailing on the bitter bound? Nay, is it Life or Death, thus thunder-crown'd, That 'mid the tide of all emergency Now notes my separate wave, and to what sea Its difficult eddies labour in the ground? Oh! what is this that knows the road I came, The flame turned cloud, the cloud returned to flame, The lifted shifted steeps and all the way?— That draws round me at last this wind-warm space, And in regenerate rapture turns my face Upon the devious coverts of dismay? SONNET LXXX FROM DAWN TO NOON As the child knows not if his mother's face Be fair; nor of his elders yet can deem What each most is; but as of hill or stream At dawn, all glimmering life surrounds his place: Who yet, tow'rd noon of his half-weary race, Pausing awhile beneath the high sun-beam And gazing steadily back,—as through a dream, In things long past new features now can trace:— Even so the thought that is at length fullgrown Turns back to note the sun-smit paths, all grey And marvellous once, where first it walked alone; And haply doubts, amid the unblenching day, Which most or least impelled its onward way,— Those unknown things or these things overknown. SONNET LXXXI MEMORIAL THRESHOLDS What place so strange,—though unrevealèd snow With unimaginable fires arise At the earth's end,—what passion of surprise Like frost-bound fire-girt scenes of long ago? Lo! this is none but I this hour; and lo! This is the very place which to mine eyes Those mortal hours in vain immortalize, 'Mid hurrying crowds, with what alone I know. City, of thine a single simple door, By some new Power reduplicate, must be Even yet my life-porch in eternity, Even with one presence filled, as once of yore: Or mocking winds whirl round a chaff-strown floor Thee and thy years and these my words and me. SONNET LXXXII HOARDED JOY I said: “Nay, pluck not,—let the first fruit be: Even as thou sayest, it is sweet and red, But let it ripen still. The tree's bent head Sees in the stream its own fecundity And bides the day of fulness. Shall not we At the sun's hour that day possess the shade, And claim our fruit before its ripeness fade, And eat it from the branch and praise the tree?” I say: “Alas! our fruit hath wooed the sun Too long,—'tis fallen and floats adown the stream. Lo, the last clusters! Pluck them every one, And let us sup with summer; ere the gleam Of autumn set the year's pent sorrow free, And the woods wail like echoes from the sea.” SONNET LXXXIII BARREN SPRING Once more the changed year's turning wheel returns: And as a girl sails balanced in the wind, And now before and now again behind Stoops as it swoops, with cheek that laughs and burns,— So Spring comes merry towards me here, but earns No answering smile from me, whose life is twin'd With the dead boughs that winter still must bind, And whom to-day the Spring no more concerns. Behold, this crocus is a withering flame; This snowdrop, snow; this apple-blossom's part To breed the fruit that breeds the serpent's art. Nay, for these Spring-flowers, turn thy face from them, Nor stay till on the year's last lily-stem The white cup shrivels round the golden heart. SONNET LXXXIV FAREWELL TO THE GLEN Sweet stream-fed glen, why say “farewell” to thee Who far'st so well and find'st for ever smooth The brow of Time where man may read no ruth? Nay, do thou rather say “farewell” to me, Who now fare forth in bitterer fantasy Than erst was mine where other shade might soothe By other streams, what while in fragrant youth The bliss of being sad made melancholy. And yet, farewell! For better shalt thou fare When children bathe sweet faces in thy flow And happy lovers blend sweet shadows there In hours to come, than when an hour ago Thine echoes had but one man's sighs to bear And thy trees whispered what he feared to know. SONNET LXXXV VAIN VIRTUES What is the sorriest thing that enters Hell? None of the sins,—but this and that fair deed Which a soul's sin at length could supersede. These yet are virgins, whom death's timely knell Might once have sainted; whom the fiends compel Together now, in snake-bound shuddering sheaves Of anguish, while the pit's pollution leaves Their refuse maidenhood abominable. Night sucks them down, the tribute of the pit, Whose names, half entered in the book of Life, Were God's desire at noon. And as their hair And eyes sink last, the Torturer deigns no whit To gaze, but, yearning, waits his destined wife, The Sin still blithe on earth that sent them there. SONNET LXXXVI LOST DAYS The lost days of my life until to-day, What were they, could I see them on the street Lie as they fell? Would they be ears of wheat Sown once for food but trodden into clay? Or golden coins squandered and still to pay? Or drops of blood dabbling the guilty feet? Or such spilt water as in dreams must cheat The undying throats of Hell, athirst alway? I do not see them here; but after death God knows I know the faces I shall see, Each one a murdered self, with low last breath. “I am thyself,—what hast thou done to me?” “And I—and I—thyself,” (lo! each one saith,) “And thou thyself to all eternity!” SONNET LXXXVII DEATH'S SONGSTERS When first that horse, within whose populous womb The birth was death, o'ershadowed Troy with fate, Her elders, dubious of its Grecian freight, Brought Helen there to sing the songs of home; She whispered, “Friends, I am alone; come, come!” Then, crouched within, Ulysses waxed afraid, And on his comrades' quivering mouths he laid His hands, and held them till the voice was dumb. The same was he who, lashed to his own mast, There where the sea-flowers screen the charnel-caves, Beside the sirens' singing island pass'd, Till sweetness failed along the inveterate waves .... Say, soul,—are songs of Death no heaven to thee, Nor shames her lip the cheek of Victory? SONNET LXXXVIII HERO'S LAMP. After the deaths of Leander and of Hero, the signal-lamp was dedicated to Anterca, with the edict that no man should light it unless his love had proved fortunate. That lamp thou fill'st in Eros' name to-night, O Hero, shall the Sestian augurs take To-morrow, and for drowned Leander's sake To Anteros its fireless lip shall plight. Aye, waft the unspoken vow: yet dawn's first light On ebbing storm and life twice ebb'd must break; While 'neath no sunrise, by the Avernian Lake, Lo where Love walks, Death's pallid neophyte. That lamp within Anteros' shadowy shrine Shall stand unlit (for so the gods decree) Till some one man the happy issue see Of a life's love, and bid its flame to shine: Which still may rest unfir'd; for, theirs or thine, O brother, what brought love to them or thee? SONNET LXXXIX THE TREES OF THE GARDEN Ye who have passed Death's haggard hills; and ye Whom trees that knew your sires shall cease to know And still stand silent:—is it all a show,— A wisp that laughs upon the wall?—decree Of some inexorable supremacy Which ever, as man strains his blind surmise From depth to ominous depth, looks past his eyes, Sphinx-faced with unabashèd augury? Nay, rather question the Earth's self. Invoke The storm-felled forest-trees moss-grown to-day Whose roots are hillocks where the children play; Or ask the silver sapling 'neath what yoke Those stars, his spray-crown's clustering gems, shall wage Their journey still when his boughs shrink with age. SONNET XC “RETRO ME, SATHANA!” Get thee behind me. Even as, heavy-curled, Stooping against the wind, a charioteer Is snatched from out his chariot by the hair, So shall Time be; and as the void car, hurled Abroad by reinless steeds, even so the world: Yea, even as chariot-dust upon the air, It shall be sought and not found anywhere. Get thee behind me, Satan. Oft unfurled, Thy perilous wings can beat and break like lath Much mightiness of men to win thee praise. Leave these weak feet to tread in narrow ways. Thou still, upon the broad vine-sheltered path, Mayst wait the turning of the phials of wrath For certain years, for certain months and days. SONNET XCI LOST ON BOTH SIDES As when two men have loved a woman well, Each hating each, through Love's and Death's deceit; Since not for either this stark marriage-sheet And the long pauses of this wedding-bell; Yet o'er her grave the night and day dispel At last their feud forlorn, with cold and heat; Nor other than dear friends to death may fleet The two lives left that most of her can tell:— So separate hopes, which in a soul had wooed The one same Peace, strove with each other long, And Peace before their faces perished since: So through that soul, in restless brotherhood, They roam together now, and wind among Its bye-streets, knocking at the dusty inns. SONNETS XCII, XCIII THE SUN'S SHAME I Beholding youth and hope in mockery caught From life; and mocking pulses that remain When the soul's death of bodily death is fain; Honour unknown, and honour known unsought; And penury's sedulous self-torturing thought On gold, whose master therewith buys his bane; And longed-for woman longing all in vain For lonely man with love's desire distraught; And wealth, and strength, and power, and pleasantness, Given unto bodies of whose souls men say, None poor and weak, slavish and foul, as they:— Beholding these things, I behold no less The blushing morn and blushing eve confess The shame that loads the intolerable day. II As some true chief of men, bowed down with stress Of life's disastrous eld, on blossoming youth May gaze, and murmur with self-pity and ruth,— “Might I thy fruitless treasure but possess, Such blessing of mine all coming years should bless;”— Then sends one sigh forth to the unknown goal, And bitterly feels breathe against his soul The hour swift-winged of nearer nothingness:— Even so the World's grey Soul to the green World Perchance one hour must cry: “Woe's me, for whom Inveteracy of ill portends the doom,— Whose heart's old fire in shadow of shame is furl'd: While thou even as of yore art journeying, All soulless now, yet merry with the Spring!” SONNET XCIV MICHELANGELO'S KISS Great Michelangelo, with age grown bleak And uttermost labours, having once o'ersaid All grievous memories on his long life shed, This worst regret to one true heart could speak:— That when, with sorrowing love and reverence meek, He stooped o'er sweet Colonna's dying bed, His Muse and dominant Lady, spirit-wed,— Her hand he kissed, but not her brow or cheek. O Buonarruoti—good at Art's fire-wheels To urge her chariot!—even thus the Soul, Touching at length some sorely-chastened goal, Earns oftenest but a little: her appeals Were deep and mute,—lowly her claim. Let be: What holds for her Death's garner? And for thee? SONNET XCV THE VASE OF LIFE Around the vase of Life at your slow pace He has not crept, but turned it with his hands, And all its sides already understands. There, girt, one breathes alert for some great race; Whose road runs far by sands and fruitful space; Who laughs, yet through the jolly throng has pass'd; Who weeps, nor stays for weeping; who at last, A youth, stands somewhere crowned, with silent face. And he has filled this vase with wine for blood, With blood for tears, with spice for burning vow, With watered flowers for buried love most fit; And would have cast it shattered to the flood, Yet in Fate's name has kept it whole; which now Stands empty till his ashes fall in it. SONNET XCVI LIFE THE BELOVED As thy friend's face, with shadow of soul o'erspread, Somewhile unto thy sight perchance hath been Ghastly and strange, yet never so is seen In thought, but to all fortunate favour wed; As thy love's death-bound features never dead To memory's glass return, but contravene Frail fugitive days, and alway keep, I ween, Than all new life a livelier lovelihead:— So Life herself, thy spirit's friend and love, Even still as Spring's authentic harbinger Glows with fresh hours for hope to glorify; Though pale she lay when in the winter grove Her funeral flowers were snow-flakes shed on her And the red wings of frost-fire rent the sky. SONNET XCVII A SUPERSCRIPTION Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been; I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell; Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell Cast up thy Life's foam-fretted feet between; Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen Which had Life's form and Love's, but by my spell Is now a shaken shadow intolerable, Of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen. Mark me, how still I am! But should there dart One moment through thy soul the soft surprise Of that winged Peace which lulls the breath of sighs— Then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart Thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes. SONNET XCVIII HE AND I Whence came his feet into my field, and why? How is it that he sees it all so drear? How do I see his seeing, and how hear The name his bitter silence knows it by? This was the little fold of separate sky Whose pasturing clouds in the soul's atmosphere Drew living light from one continual year: How should he find it lifeless? He, or I? Lo! this new Self now wanders round my field, With plaints for every flower, and for each tree A moan, the sighing wind's auxiliary: And o'er sweet waters of my life, that yield Unto his lips no draught but tears unseal'd, Even in my place he weeps. Even I, not he. SONNETS XCIX, C NEWBORN DEATH I To-day Death seems to me an infant child Which her worn mother Life upon my knee Has set to grow my friend and play with me; If haply so my heart might be beguil'd To find no terrors in a face so mild,— If haply so my weary heart might be Unto the newborn milky eyes of thee, O Death, before resentment reconcil'd. How long, O Death? And shall thy feet depart Still a young child's with mine, or wilt thou stand Fullgrown the helpful daughter of my heart, What time with thee indeed I reach the strand Of the pale wave which knows thee what thou art, And drink it in the hollow of thy hand? II And thou, O Life, the lady of all bliss, With whom, when our first heart beat full and fast, I wandered till the haunts of men were pass'd, And in fair places found all bowers amiss Till only woods and waves might hear our kiss, While to the winds all thought of Death we cast:— Ah, Life! and must I have from thee at last No smile to greet me and no babe but this? Lo! Love, the child once ours; and Song, whose hair Blew like a flame and blossomed like a wreath; And Art, whose eyes were worlds by God found fair: These o'er the book of Nature mixed their breath With neck-twined arms, as oft we watched them there: And did these die that thou mightst bear me Death? SONNET CI THE ONE HOPE When vain desire at last and vain regret Go hand in hand to death, and all is vain, What shall assuage the unforgotten pain And teach the unforgetful to forget? Shall Peace be still a sunk stream long unmet,— Or may the soul at once in a green plain Stoop through the spray of some sweet life-fountain And cull the dew-drenched flowering amulet? Ah! when the wan soul in that golden air Between the scriptured petals softly blown Peers breathless for the gift of grace unknown,— Ah! let none other alien spell soe'er But only the one Hope's one name be there,— Not less nor more, but even that word alone. EDEN BOWER It was Lilith the wife of Adam: (Sing Eden Bower!) Not a drop of her blood was human, But she was made like a soft sweet woman. Lilith stood on the skirts of Eden; (Alas the hour!) She was the first that thence was driven; With her was hell and with Eve was heaven. In the ear of the Snake said Lilith:— (Sing Eden Bower!) “To thee I come when the rest is over; A snake was I when thou wast my lover. “I was the fairest snake in Eden: (Alas the hour!) By the earth's will, new form and feature Made me a wife for the earth's new creature. “Take me thou as I come from Adam: (Sing Eden Bower!) Once again shall my love subdue thee; The past is past and I am come to thee. “O but Adam was thrall to Lilith! (Alas the hour!) All the threads of my hair are golden, And there in a net his heart was holden. “O and Lilith was queen of Adam! (Sing Eden Bower!) All the day and the night together My breath could shake his soul like a feather. “What great joys had Adam and Lilith!— (Alas the hour!) Sweet close rings of the serpent's twining, As heart in heart lay sighing and pining. “What bright babes had Lilith and Adam! (Sing Eden Bower!) Shapes that coiled in the woods and waters, Glittering sons and radiant daughters. “O thou God, the Lord God of Eden! (Alas the hour!) Say, was this fair body for no man, That of Adam's flesh thou mak'st him a woman? “O thou Snake, the King-snake of Eden! (Sing Eden Bower!) God's strong will our necks are under, But thou and I may cleave it in sunder. “Help, sweet Snake, sweet lover of Lilith! (Alas the hour!) And let God learn how I loved and hated Man in the image of God created. “Help me once against Eve and Adam! (Sing Eden Bower!) Help me once for this one endeavour, And then my love shall be thine for ever! “Strong is God, the fell foe of Lilith: (Alas the hour!) Nought in heaven or earth may affright Him; But join thou with me and we will smite Him. “Strong is God, the great God of Eden: (Sing Eden Bower!) Over all He made He hath power; But lend me thou thy shape for an hour! “Lend thy shape for the love of Lilith! (Alas the hour!) Look, my mouth and my cheek are ruddy, And thou art cold, and fire is my body. “Lend thy shape for the hate of Adam! (Sing Eden Bower!) That he may wail my joy that forsook him, And curse the day when the bride-sleep took him. “Lend thy shape for the shame of Eden! (Alas the hour!) Is not the foe-God weak as the foeman When love grows hate in the heart of a woman? “Wouldst thou know the heart's hope of Lilith? (Sing Eden Bower!) Then bring thou close thine head till it glisten Along my breast, and lip me and listen. “Am I sweet, O sweet Snake of Eden? (Alas the hour!) Then ope thine ear to my warm mouth's cooing And learn what deed remains for our doing. “Thou didst hear when God said to Adam:— (Sing Eden Bower!) ‘Of all this wealth I have made thee warden; Thou'rt free to eat of the trees of the garden: “‘Only of one tree eat not in Eden: (Alas the hour!) All save one I give to thy freewill,— The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.’ “O my love, come nearer to Lilith! (Sing Eden Bower!) In thy sweet folds bind me and bend me, And let me feel the shape thou shalt lend me. “In thy shape I'll go back to Eden; (Alas the hour!) In these coils that Tree will I grapple, And stretch this crowned head forth by the apple. “Lo, Eve bends to the breath of Lilith! (Sing Eden Bower!) O how then shall my heart desire All her blood as food to its fire! “Lo, Eve bends to the words of Lilith!— (Alas the hour!) ‘Nay, this Tree's fruit,—why should ye hate it, Or Death be born the day that ye ate it? “‘Nay, but on that great day in Eden, Sing Eden Bower!) By the help that in this wise Tree is, God knows well ye shall be as He is.’ “Then Eve shall eat and give unto Adam; (Alas the hour!) And then they both shall know they are naked, And their hearts ache as my heart hath achèd. “Ay, let them hide ‘mid the trees of Eden, (Sing Eden Bower!) As in the cool of the day in the garden God shall walk without pity or pardon. “Hear, thou Eve, the man's heart in Adam! (Alas the hour!) Of his brave words hark to the bravest:— ‘This the woman gave that thou gavest.’ “Hear Eve speak, yea list to her, Lilith! (Sing Eden Bower!) Feast thine heart with words that shall sate it— ‘This the serpent gave and I ate it.’ “O proud Eve, cling close to thine Adam, (Alas the hour!) Driven forth as the beasts of his naming By the sword that for ever is flaming. “Know, thy path is known unto Lilith! (Sing Eden Bower!) While the blithe birds sang at thy wedding, There her tears grew thorns for thy treading. “O my love, thou Love-snake of Eden! (Alas the hour!) O to-day and the day to come after! Loose me, love,—give breath to my laughter. “O bright Snake, the Death-worm of Adam! (Sing Eden Bower!) Wreathe thy neck with my hair's bright tether, And wear my gold and thy gold together! “On that day on the skirts of Eden, (Alas the hour!) In thy shape shall I glide back to thee, And in my shape for an instant view thee. “But when thou'rt thou and Lilith is Lilith, (Sing Eden Bower!) In what bliss past hearing or seeing Shall each one drink of the other's being! “With cries of ‘Eve!’ and ‘Eden!’ and ‘Adam!’ (Alas the hour!) How shall we mingle our love's caresses, I in thy coils, and thou in my tresses! “With those names, ye echoes of Eden, (Sing Eden Bower!) Fire shall cry from my heart that burneth,— ‘Dust he is and to dust returneth!’ “Yet to-day, thou master of Lilith,— (Alas the hour!) Wrap me round in the form I'll borrow And let me tell thee of sweet to-morrow. “In the planted garden eastward in Eden, (Sing Eden Bower!) Where the river goes forth to water the garden, The springs shall dry and the soil shall harden. “Yea, where the bride-sleep fell upon Adam, (Alas the hour!) None shall hear when the storm-wind whistles Through roses choked among thorns and thistles. “Yea, beside the east-gate of Eden, (Sing Eden Bower!) Where God joined them and none might sever, The sword turns this way and that for ever. “What of Adam cast out of Eden? (Alas the hour!) Lo! with care like a shadow shaken, He tills the hard earth whence he was taken. “What of Eve too, cast out of Eden? (Sing Eden Bower!) Nay, but she, the bride of God's giving, Must yet be mother of all men living. “Lo, God's grace, by the grace of Lilith! (Alas the hour!) To Eve's womb, from our sweet to-morrow, God shall greatly multiply sorrow. “Fold me fast, O God-snake of Eden! (Sing Eden Bower!) What more prize than love to impel thee? Grip and lip my limbs as I tell thee! “Lo! two babes for Eve and for Adam! (Alas the hour!) Lo! sweet Snake, the travail and treasure,— Two men-children born for their pleasure! “The first is Cain and the second Abel: (Sing Eden Bower!) The soul of one shall be made thy brother, And thy tongue shall lap the blood of the other.” (Alas the hour!) THE STREAM'S SECRET What thing unto mine ear Wouldst thou convey,—what secret thing, O wandering water ever whispering? Surely thy speech shall be of her. Thou water, O thou whispering wanderer, What message dost thou bring? Say, hath not Love leaned low This hour beside thy far well-head, And there through jealous hollowed fingers said The thing that most I long to know,— Murmuring with curls all dabbled in thy flow And washed lips rosy red? He told it to thee there Where thy voice hath a louder tone; But where it welters to this little moan His will decrees that I should hear. Now speak: for with the silence is no fear, And I am all alone. Shall Time not still endow One hour with life, and I and she Slake in one kiss the thirst of memory? Say, stream; lest Love should disavow Thy service, and the bird upon the bough Sing first to tell it me. What whisperest thou? Nay, why Name the dead hours? I mind them well: Their ghosts in many darkened doorways dwell With desolate eyes to know them by. The hour that must be born ere it can die,— Of that I'd have thee tell. But hear, before thou speak! Withhold, I pray, the vain behest That while the maze hath still its bower for quest My burning heart should cease to seek. Be sure that Love ordained for souls more meek His roadside dells of rest. Stream, when this silver thread In flood-time is a torrent brown May any bulwark bind thy foaming crown? Shall not the waters surge and spread And to the crannied boulders of their bed Still shoot the dead drift down? Let no rebuke find place In speech of thine: or it shall prove That thou dost ill expound the words of Love, Even as thine eddy's rippling race Would blur the perfect image of his face. I will have none thereof. O learn and understand That 'gainst the wrongs himself did wreak Love sought her aid; until her shadowy cheek And eyes beseeching gave command; And compassed in her close compassionate hand My heart must burn and speak. For then at last we spoke What eyes so oft had told to eyes Through that long-lingering silence whose half-sighs Alone the buried secret broke, Which with snatched hands and lips' reverberate stroke Then from the heart did rise. But she is far away Now; nor the hours of night grown hoar Bring yet to me, long gazing from the door, The wind-stirred robe of roseate grey And rose-crown of the hour that leads the day When we shall meet once more. Dark as thy blinded wave When brimming midnight floods the glen,— Bright as the laughter of thy runnels when The dawn yields all the light they crave; Even so these hours to wound and that to save Are sisters in Love's ken. Oh sweet her bending grace Then when I kneel beside her feet; And sweet her eyes' o'erhanging heaven; and sweet The gathering folds of her embrace; And her fall'n hair at last shed round my face When breaths and tears shall meet. Beneath her sheltering hair, In the warm silence near her breast, Our kisses and our sobs shall sink to rest; As in some still trance made aware That day and night have wrought to fulness there And Love has built our nest. And as in the dim grove, When the rains cease that hushed them long, 'Mid glistening boughs the song-birds wake to song,— So from our hearts deep-shrined in love, While the leaves throb beneath, around, above, The quivering notes shall throng. Till tenderest words found vain Draw back to wonder mute and deep, And closed lips in closed arms a silence keep, Subdued by memory's circling strain,— The wind-rapt sound that the wind brings again While all the willows weep. Then by her summoning art Shall memory conjure back the sere Autumnal Springs, from many a dying year Born dead; and, bitter to the heart, The very ways where now we walk apart Who then shall cling so near. And with each thought new-grown, Some sweet caress or some sweet name Low-breathed shall let me know her thought the same; Making me rich with every tone And touch of the dear heaven so long unknown That filled my dreams with flame. Pity and love shall burn In her pressed cheek and cherishing hands; And from the living spirit of love that stands Between her lips to soothe and yearn, Each separate breath shall clasp me round in turn And loose my spirit's bands. Oh passing sweet and dear, Then when the worshipped form and face Are felt at length in darkling close embrace; Round which so oft the sun shone clear, With mocking light and pitiless atmosphere, In many an hour and place. Ah me! with what proud growth Shall that hour's thirsting race be run; While, for each several sweetness still begun Afresh, endures love's endless drouth: Sweet hands, sweet hair, sweet cheeks, sweet eyes, sweet mouth, Each singly wooed and won. Yet most with the sweet soul Shall love's espousals then be knit; For very passion of peace shall breathe from it O'er tremulous wings that touch the goal, As on the unmeasured height of Love's control The lustral fires are lit. Therefore, when breast and cheek Now part, from long embraces free,— Each on the other gazing shall but see A self that has no heed to speak: All things unsought, yet nothing more to seek,— One love in unity. O water wandering past,— Albeit to thee I speak this thing, O water, thou that wanderest whispering, Thou keep'st thy counsel to the last. What spell upon thy bosom should Love cast, His message thence to wring? Nay, must thou hear the tale Of the past days,—the heavy debt Of life that obdurate time withholds,—ere yet To win thine ear these prayers prevail, And by thy voice Love's self with high All-hail Yield up the amulet? How should all this be told?— All the sad sum of wayworn days;— Heart's anguish in the impenetrable maze; And on the waste uncoloured wold The visible burthen of the sun grown cold And the moon's labouring gaze? Alas! shall hope be nurs'd On life's all-succouring breast in vain, And made so perfect only to be slain? Or shall not rather the sweet thirst Even yet rejoice the heart with warmth dispers'd And strength grown fair again? Stands it not by the door— Love's Hour—till she and I shall meet; With bodiless form and unapparent feet That cast no shadow yet before, Though round its head the dawn begins to pour The breath that makes day sweet? Its eyes invisible Watch till the dial's thin-thrown shade Be born,—yea, till the journeying line be laid Upon the point that wakes the spell, And there in lovelier light than tongue can tell Its presence stand array'd. Its soul remembers yet Those sunless hours that passed it by; And still it hears the night's disconsolate cry, And feels the branches wringing wet Cast on its brow, that may not once forget, Dumb tears from the blind sky. But oh! when now her foot Draws near, for whose sake night and day Were long in weary longing sighed away,— The Hour of Love, 'mid airs grown mute, Shall sing beside the door, and Love's own lute Thrill to the passionate lay. Thou know'st, for Love has told Within thine ear, O stream, how soon That song shall lift its sweet appointed tune. O tell me, for my lips are cold, And in my veins the blood is waxing old Even while I beg the boon. So, in that hour of sighs Assuaged, shall we beside this stone Yield thanks for grace; while in thy mirror shown The twofold image softly lies, Until we kiss, and each in other's eyes Is imaged all alone. Still silent? Can no art Of Love's then move thy pity? Nay, To thee let nothing come that owns his sway: Let happy lovers have no part With thee; nor even so sad and poor a heart As thou hast spurned to-day. To-day? Lo! night is here. The glen grows heavy with some veil Risen from the earth or fall'n to make earth pale; And all stands hushed to eye and ear, Until the night-wind shake the shade like fear And every covert quail. Ah! by a colder wave On deathlier airs the hour must come Which to thy heart, my love, shall call me home. Between the lips of the low cave Against that night the lapping waters lave, And the dark lips are dumb. But there Love's self doth stand, And with Life's weary wings far-flown, And with Death's eyes that make the water moan, Gathers the water in his hand: And they that drink know nought of sky or land But only love alone. O soul-sequestered face Far off,—O were that night but now! So even beside that stream even I and thou Through thirsting lips should draw Love's grace, And in the zone of that supreme embrace Bind aching breast and brow. O water whispering Still through the dark into mine ears,— As with mine eyes, is it not now with hers?— Mine eyes that add to thy cold spring, Wan water, wandering water weltering, This hidden tide of tears. ROSE MARY Of her two fights with the Beryl-stone Lost the first, but the second won. PART I “Mary mine that art Mary's Rose, Come in to me from the garden-close. The sun sinks fast with the rising dew, And we marked not how the faint moon grew; But the hidden stars are calling you. “Tall Rose Mary, come to my side, And read the stars if you'd be a bride. In hours whose need was not your own, While you were a young maid yet ungrown You've read the stars in the Beryl-stone. “Daughter, once more I bid you read; But now let it be for your own need: Because to-morrow, at break of day, To Holy Cross he rides on his way, Your knight Sir James of Heronhaye. “Ere he wed you, flower of mine, For a heavy shrift he seeks the shrine. Now hark to my words and do not fear; Ill news next I have for your ear; But be you strong, and our help is here. “On his road, as the rumour's rife, An ambush waits to take his life. He needs will go, and will go alone; Where the peril lurks may not be known; But in this glass all things are shown.” Pale Rose Mary sank to the floor:— “The night will come if the day is o'er!” “Nay, heaven takes counsel, star with star, And help shall reach your heart from afar: A bride you'll be, as a maid you are.” The lady unbound her jewelled zone And drew from her robe the Beryl-stone. Shaped it was to a shadowy sphere,— World of our world, the sun's compeer, That bears and buries the toiling year. With shuddering light 'twas stirred and strewn Like the cloud-nest of the wading moon: Freaked it was as the bubble's ball, Rainbow-hued through a misty pall Like the middle light of the waterfall. Shadows dwelt in its teeming girth Of the known and unknown things of earth; The cloud above and the wave around,— The central fire at the sphere's heart bound, Like doomsday prisoned underground. A thousand years it lay in the sea With a treasure wrecked from Thessaly; Deep it lay 'mid the coiled sea-wrack, But the ocean-spirits found the track: A soul was lost to win it back. The lady upheld the wondrous thing:— “Ill fare” (she said) “with a fiend's-fairing: But Moslem blood poured forth like wine Can hallow Hell, 'neath the Sacred Sign; And my lord brought this from Palestine. “Spirits who fear the Blessed Rood Drove forth the accursed multitude That heathen worship housed herein,— Never again such home to win, Save only by a Christian's sin. “All last night at an altar fair I burnt strange fires and strove with prayer; Till the flame paled to the red sunrise, All rites I then did solemnize; And the spell lacks nothing but your eyes.” Low spake maiden Rose Mary:— “O mother mine, if I should not see!” “Nay, daughter, cover your face no more, But bend love's heart to the hidden lore, And you shall see now as heretofore.” Paler yet were the pale cheeks grown As the grey eyes sought the Beryl-stone: Then over her mother's lap leaned she, And stretched her thrilled throat passionately, And sighed from her soul, and said, “I see.” Even as she spoke, they two were 'ware Of music-notes that fell through the air; A chiming shower of strange device, Drop echoing drop, once, twice, and thrice, As rain may fall in Paradise. An instant come, in an instant gone, No time there was to think thereon. The mother held the sphere on her knee:— “Lean this way and speak low to me, And take no note but of what you see.” “I see a man with a besom grey That sweeps the flying dust away.” “Ay, that comes first in the mystic sphere; But now that the way is swept and clear, Heed well what next you look on there.” “Stretched aloft and adown I see Two roads that part in waste-country: The glen lies deep and the ridge stands tall; What's great below is above seen small, And the hill-side is the valley-wall.” “Stream-bank, daughter, or moor and moss, Both roads will take to Holy Cross. The hills are a weary waste to wage; But what of the valley-road's presage? That way must tend his pilgrimage.” “As 'twere the turning leaves of a book, The road runs past me as I look; Or it is even as though mine eye Should watch calm waters filled with sky While lights and clouds and wings went by.” “In every covert seek a spear; They'll scarce lie close till he draws near.” “The stream has spread to a river now; The stiff blue sedge is deep in the slough, But the banks are bare of shrub or bough.’ “Is there any roof that near at hand Might shelter yield to a hidden band?” “On the further bank I see but one, And a herdsman now in the sinking sun Unyokes his team at the threshold-stone.” “Keep heedful watch by the water's edge,— Some boat might lurk 'neath the shadowed sedge.” “One slid but now 'twixt the winding shores, But a peasant woman bent to the oars And only a young child steered its course. “Mother, something flashed to my sight!— Nay, it is but the lapwing's flight.— What glints there like a lance that flees?— Nay, the flags are stirred in the breeze, And the water's bright through the dart-rushes. “Ah! vainly I search from side to side:— Woe's me! and where do the foemen hide? Woe's me! and perchance I pass them by, And under the new dawn's blood-red sky Even where I gaze the dead shall lie.” Said the mother: “For dear love's sake, Speak more low, lest the spell should break.” Said the daughter: “By love's control, My eyes, my words, are strained to the goal; But oh! the voice that cries in my soul!” “Hush, sweet, hush! be calm and behold.” “I see two floodgates broken and old: The grasses wave o'er the ruined weir, But the bridge still leads to the breakwater; And—mother, mother, O mother dear!” The damsel clung to her mother's knee, And dared not let the shriek go free; Low she crouched by the lady's chair, And shrank blindfold in her fallen hair, And whispering said, “The spears are there!” The lady stooped aghast from her place, And cleared the locks from her daughter's face. “More's to see, and she swoons, alas! Look, look again, ere the moment pass! One shadow comes but once to the glass. “See you there what you saw but now?” “I see eight men 'neath the willow bough. All over the weir a wild growth's spread: Ah me! it will hide a living head As well as the water hides the dead. “They lie by the broken water-gate As men who have a while to wait. The chief's high lance has a blazoned scroll,— He seems some lord of tithe and toll With seven squires to his bannerole. “The little pennon quakes in the air, I cannot trace the blazon there:— Ah! now I can see the field of blue, The spurs and the merlins two and two;— It is the Warden of Holycleugh!” “God be thanked for the thing we know! You have named your good knight's mortal foe. Last Shrovetide in the tourney-game He sought his life by treasonous shame; And this way now doth he seek the same. “So, fair lord, such a thing you are! But we too watch till the morning star. Well, June is kind and the moon is clear: Saint Judas send you a merry cheer For the night you lie at Warisweir! “Now, sweet daughter, but one more sight, And you may lie soft and sleep to-night. We know in the vale what perils be: Now look once more in the glass, and see If over the hills the road lies free.” Rose Mary pressed to her mother's cheek, And almost smiled but did not speak; Then turned again to the saving spell, With eyes to search and with lips to tell The heart of things invisible. “Again the shape with the besom grey Comes back to sweep the clouds away. Again I stand where the roads divide; But now all's near on the steep hillside, And a thread far down is the rivertide.” “Ay, child, your road is o'er moor and moss, Past Holycleugh to Holy Cross. Our hunters lurk in the valley's wake, As they knew which way the chase would take: Yet search the hills for your true love's sake.” “Swift and swifter the waste runs by, And nought I see but the heath and the sky; No brake is there that could hide a spear, And the gaps to a horseman's sight lie clear; Still past it goes, and there's nought to fear.” “Fear no trap that you cannot see,— They'd not lurk yet too warily. Below by the weir they lie in sight, And take no heed how they pass the night Till close they crouch with the morning light.” “The road shifts ever and brings in view Now first the heights of Holycleugh: Dark they stand o'er the vale below, And hide that heaven which yet shall show The thing their master's heart doth know. “Where the road looks to the castle steep, There are seven hill-clefts wide and deep: Six mine eyes can search as they list, But the seventh hollow is brimmed with mist: If aught were there, it might not be wist.” “Small hope, my girl, for a helm to hide In mists that cling to a wild moorside: Soon they melt with the wind and sun, And scarce would wait such deeds to be done God send their snares be the worst to shun.” “Still the road winds ever anew As it hastens on towards Holycleugh; And ever the great walls loom more near, Till the castle-shadow, steep and sheer, Drifts like a cloud, and the sky is clear.” “Enough, my daughter,” the mother said, And took to her breast the bending head; “Rest, poor head, with my heart below, While love still lulls you as long ago: For all is learnt that we need to know. “Long the miles and many the hours From the castle-height to the abbey-towers; But here the journey has no more dread; Too thick with life is the whole road spread For murder's trembling foot to tread.” She gazed on the Beryl-stone full fain Ere she wrapped it close in her robe again: The flickering shades were dusk and dun And the lights throbbed faint in unison Like a high heart when a race is run. As the globe slid to its silken gloom, Once more a music rained through the room; Low it splashed like a sweet star-spray, And sobbed like tears at the heart of May, And died as laughter dies away. The lady held her breath for a space, And then she looked in her daughter's face: But wan Rose Mary had never heard; Deep asleep like a sheltered bird She lay with the long spell minister'd. “Ah! and yet I must leave you, dear, For what you have seen your knight must hear. Within four days, by the help of God, He comes back safe to his heart's abode: Be sure he shall shun the valley-road.” Rose Mary sank with a broken moan, And lay in the chair and slept alone, Weary, lifeless, heavy as lead: Long it was ere she raised her head And rose up all discomforted. She searched her brain for a vanished thing, And clasped her brows, remembering; Then knelt and lifted her eyes in awe, And sighed with a long sigh sweet to draw:— “Thank God, thank God, thank God I saw!” The lady had left her as she lay, To seek the Knight of Heronhaye. But first she clomb by a secret stair, And knelt at a carven altar fair, And laid the precious Beryl there. Its girth was graved with a mystic rune In a tongue long dead 'neath sun and moon: A priest of the Holy Sepulchre Read that writing and did not err; And her lord had told its sense to her. She breathed the words in an undertone:— “None sees here but the pure alone.” “And oh!” she said, “what rose may be In Mary's bower more pure to see Than my own sweet maiden Rose Mary?” Beryl-Song We whose home is the Beryl, Fire-spirits of dread desire, Who entered in By a secret sin, 'Gainst whom all powers that strive with ours are sterile,— We cry, Woe to thee, mother! What hast thou taught her, the girl thy daughter, That she and none other Should this dark morrow to her deadly sorrow imperil? What were her eyes But the fiend's own spies, O mother, And shall We not fee her, our proper prophet and se?r? Go to her, mother, Even thou, yea thou and none other, Thou, from the Beryl: Her fee must thou take her, Her fee that We send, and make her, Even in this hour, her sin's unsheltered avower. Whose steed did neigh, Riderless, bridleless, At her gate before it was day? Lo! where doth hover The soul of her lover? She sealed his doom, she, she was the sworn approver,— Whose eyes were so wondrous wise, Yet blind, ah! blind to his peril! For stole not We in Through a love-linked sin, 'Gainst whom all powers at war with ours are sterile,— Fire-spirits of dread desire, We whose home is the Beryl? PART II “Pale Rose Mary, what shall be done With a rose that Mary weeps upon?” “Mother, let it fall from the tree, And never walk where the strewn leaves be Till winds have passed and the path is free.” “Sad Rose Mary, what shall be done With a cankered flower beneath the sun?” “Mother, let it wait for the night; Be sure its shame shall be out of sight Ere the moon pale or the east grow light.” “Lost Rose Mary, what shall be done With a heart that is but a broken one?” “Mother, let it lie where it must; The blood was drained with the bitter thrust, And dust is all that sinks in the dust.” “Poor Rose Mary, what shall I do,— I, your mother, that lovèd you?” “O my mother, and is love gone? Then seek you another love anon: Who cares what shame shall lean upon?” Low drooped trembling Rose Mary, Then up as though in a dream stood she. “Come, my heart, it is time to go; This is the hour that has whispered low When thy pulse quailed in the nights we know. “Yet O my heart, thy shame has a mate Who will not leave thee desolate. Shame for shame, yea and sin for sin: Yet peace at length may our poor souls win If love for love be found therein. “O thou who seek'st our shrift to-day,” She cried, “O James of Heronhaye— Thy sin and mine was for love alone; And oh! in the sight of God 'tis known How the heart has since made heavy moan. “Three days yet!” she said to her heart; “But then he comes, and we will not part. God, God be thanked that I still could see! Oh! he shall come back assuredly, But where, alas! must he seek for me? “O my heart, what road shall we roam Till my wedding-music fetch me home? For love's shut from us and bides afar, And scorn leans over the bitter bar And knows us now for the thing we are.” Tall she stood with a cheek flushed high And a gaze to burn the heart-strings by. 'Twas the lightning-flash o'er sky and plain Ere labouring thunders heave the chain From the floodgates of the drowning rain. The mother looked on the daughter still As on a hurt thing that's yet to kill. Then wildly at length the pent tears came; The love swelled high with the swollen shame, And their hearts' tempest burst on them. Closely locked, they clung without speech, And the mirrored souls shook each to each, As the cloud-moon and the water-moon Shake face to face when the dim stars swoon In stormy bowers of the night's mid-noon. They swayed together, shuddering sore, Till the mother's heart could bear no more. 'Twas death to feel her own breast shake Even to the very throb and ache Of the burdened heart she still must break. All her sobs ceased suddenly, And she sat straight up but scarce could see. “O daughter, where should my speech begin? Your heart held fast its secret sin: How think you, child, that I read therein?” “Ah me! but I thought not how it came When your words showed that you knew my shame: And now that you call me still your own, I half forget you have ever known. Did you read my heart in the Beryl-stone?” The lady answered her mournfully:— “The Beryl-stone has no voice for me: But when you charged its power to show The truth which none but the pure may know, Did naught speak once of a coming woe?” Her hand was close to her daughter's heart, And it felt the life-blood's sudden start: A quick deep breath did the damsel draw, Llke the struck fawn in the oakenshaw: “O mother,” she cried, “but still I saw!” “O child, my child, why held you apart From my great love your hidden heart? Said I not that all sin must chase From the spell's sphere the spirits of grace, And yield their rule to the evil race? “Ah! would to God I had clearly told How strong those powers, accurst of old: Their heart is the ruined house of lies; O girl, they can seal the sinful eyes, Or show the truth by contraries!” The daughter sat as cold as a stone, And spoke no word but gazed alone, Nor moved, though her mother strove a space To clasp her round in a close embrace, Because she dared not see her face. “Oh!” at last did the mother cry, “Be sure, as he loved you, so will I! Ah! still and dumb is the bride, I trow; But cold and stark as the winter snow Is the bridegroom's heart, laid dead below! “Daughter, daughter, remember you That cloud in the hills by Holycleugh? 'Twas a Hell-screen hiding truth away: There, not i'the vale, the ambush lay, And thence was the dead borne home to-day.” Deep the flood and heavy the shock When sea meets sea in the riven rock: But calm is the pulse that shakes the sea To the prisoned tide of doom set free In the breaking heart of Rose Mary. Once she sprang as the heifer springs With the wolf's teeth at its red heart-strings. First 'twas fire in her breast and brain, And then scarce hers but the whole world's pain, As she gave one shriek and sank again. In the hair dark-waved the face lay white As the moon lies in the lap of night; And as night through which no moon may dart Lies on a pool in the woods apart, So lay the swoon on the weary heart. The lady felt for the bosom's stir, And wildly kissed and called on her; Then turned away with a quick footfall, And slid the secret door in the wall, And clomb the strait stair's interval. There above in the altar-cell A little fountain rose and fell: She set a flask to the water's flow, And, backward hurrying, sprinkled now The still cold breast and the pallid brow. Scarce cheek that warmed or breath on the air, Yet something told that life was there. “Ah! not with the heart the body dies!” The lady moaned in a bitter wise; Then wrung her hands and hid her eyes. “Alas! and how may I meet again In the same poor eyes the selfsame pain? What help can I seek, such grief to guide? Ah! one alone might avail,” she cried— “The priest who prays at the dead man's side.” The lady arose, and sped down all The winding stairs to the castle-hall. Long-known valley and wood and stream, As the loopholes passed, naught else did seem Than the torn threads of a broken dream. The hall was full of the castle-folk; The women wept, but the men scarce spoke. As the lady crossed the rush-strewn floor, The throng fell backward, murmuring sore, And pressed outside round the open door. A stranger shadow hung on the hall Than the dark pomp of a funeral. 'Mid common sights that were there alway, As 'twere a chance of the passing day, On the ingle-bench the dead man lay. A priest who passed by Holycleugh The tidings brought when the day was new, He guided them who had fetched the dead; And since that hour, unwearièd, He knelt in prayer at the low bier's head. Word had gone to his own domain That in evil wise the knight was slain: Soon the spears must gather apace And the hunt be hard on the hunters' trace; But all things yet lay still for a space. As the lady's hurried step drew near, The kneeling priest looked up to her. “Father, death is a grievous thing; But oh! the woe has a sharper sting That craves by me your ministering. “Alas for the child that should have wed This noble knight here lying dead! Dead in hope, with all blessed boon Of love thus rent from her heart ere noon, I left her laid in a heavy swoon. “O haste to the open bower-chamber That's topmost as you mount the stair: Seek her, father, ere yet she wake; Your words, not mine, be the first to slake This poor heart's fire, for Christ's sweet sake! “God speed!” she said as the priest passed through, “And I ere long will be with you.” Then low on the hearth her knees sank prone; She signed all folk from the threshold-stone, And gazed in the dead man's face alone. The fight for life found record yet In the clenched lips and the teeth hard-set; The wrath from the bent brow was not gone And stark in the eyes the hate still shone Of that they last had looked upon. The blazoned coat was rent on his breast Where the golden field was goodliest; But the shivered sword, close-gripped, could tell That the blood shed round him where he fell Was not all his in the distant dell. The lady recked of the corpse no whit, But saw the soul and spoke to it: A light there was in her steadfast eyes,— The fire of mortal tears and sighs That pity and love immortalize. “By thy death have I learnt to-day Thy deed, O James of Heronhaye! Great wrong thou hast done to me and mine; And haply God hath wrought for a sign By our blind deed this doom of thine. “Thy shrift, alas! thou wast not to win; But may death shrive thy soul herein! Full well do I know thy love should be Even yet—had life but stayed with thee— Our honour's strong security.” She stooped, and said with a sob's low stir,— “Peace be thine,—but what peace for her?” But ere to the brow her lips were press'd, She marked, half-hid in the riven vest, A packet close to the dead man's breast. 'Neath surcoat pierced and broken mail It lay on the blood-stained bosom pale. The clot hung round it, dull and dense, And a faintness seized her mortal sense As she reached her hand and drew it thence. 'Twas steeped in the heart's flood welling high From the heart it there had rested by: 'Twas glued to a broidered fragment gay,— A shred by spear-thrust rent away From the heron-wings of Heronhaye. She gazed on the thing with piteous eyne:— “Alas, poor child, some pledge of thine! Ah me! in this troth the hearts were twain, And one hath ebbed to this crimson stain, And when shall the other throb again?” She opened the packet heedfully; The blood was stiff, and it scarce might be. She found but a folded paper there, And round it, twined with tenderest care, A long bright tress of golden hair. Even as she looked, she saw again That dark-haired face in its swoon of pain: It seemed a snake with a golden sheath Crept near, as a slow flame flickereth, And stung her daughter's heart to death. She loosed the tress, but her hand did shake As though indeed she had touched a snake; And next she undid the paper's fold, But that too trembled in her hold, And the sense scarce grasped the tale it told. “My heart's sweet lord,” ('twas thus she read,) “At length our love is garlanded. At Holy Cross, within eight days' space, I seek my shrift; and the time and place Shall fit thee too for thy soul's good grace. “From Holycleugh on the seventh day My brother rides, and bides away: And long or e'er he is back, mine own, Afar where the face of fear's unknown We shall be safe with our love alone. “Ere yet at the shrine my knees I bow, I shear one tress for our holy vow. As round these words these threads I wind, So, eight days hence, shall our loves be twined, Says my lord's poor lady, Jocelind.” She read it twice, with a brain in thrall, And then its echo told her all. O'er brows low-fall'n her hands she drew:— “O God!” she said, as her hands fell too,— “The Warden's sister of Holycleugh!” She rose upright with a long low moan, And stared in the dead man's face new-known. Had it lived indeed? She scarce could tell: 'Twas a cloud where fiends had come to dwell,— A mask that hung on the gate of Hell. She lifted the lock of gleaming hair And smote the lips and left it there. “Here's gold that Hell shall take for thy toll! Full well hath thy treason found its goal, O thou dead body and damnèd soul!” She turned, sore dazed, for a voice was near, And she knew that some one called to her. On many a column fair and tall A high court ran round the castle-hall; And thence it was that the priest did call. “I sought your child where you bade me go, And in rooms around and rooms below; But where, alas! may the maiden be? Fear nought,—we shall find her speedily,— But come, come hither, and seek with me.” She reached the stair like a lifelorn thing, But hastened upward murmuring;— “Yea, Death's is a face that's fell to see; But bitterer pang Life hoards for thee, Thou broken heart of Rose Mary!” Beryl-Song We whose throne is the Beryl, Dire-gifted spirits of fire, Who for a twin Leash Sorrow to Sin, Who on no flower refrain to lour with peril,— We cry,—O desolate daughter! Thou and thy mother share newer shame with each other Than last night's slaughter. Awake and tremble, for our curses assemble! What more, that thou know'st not yet,— That life nor death shall forget? No help from Heaven,—thy woes heart-riven are sterile! O once a maiden, With yet worse sorrow can any morrow be laden? It waits for thee, It looms, it must be, O lost among women,— It comes and thou canst not flee. Amen to the omen, Says the voice of the Beryl. Thou sleep'st? Awake,— What dar'st thou yet for his sake, Who each for other did God's own Future imperil? Dost dare to live 'Mid the pangs each hour must give? Nay, rather die,— With him thy lover 'neath Hell's cloud-cover to fly,— Hopeless, yet not apart, Cling heart to heart, And beat through the nether storm-eddying winds together? Shall this be so? There thou shalt meet him, but mayst thou greet him? ah no! He loves, but thee he hoped nevermore to see,— He sighed as he died, But with never a thought for thee. Alone! Alone, for ever alone,— Whose eyes were such wondrous spies for the fate foreshown! Lo! haue not We leashed the twin Of endless Sorrow to Sin,— Who on no flower refrain to lour with peril,— Dire-gifted spirits of fire, We whose throne is the Beryl? PART III A swoon that breaks is the whelming wave When help comes late but still can save. With all blind throes is the instant rife,— Hurtling clangour and clouds at strife,— The breath of death, but the kiss of life. The night lay deep on Rose Mary's heart, For her swoon was death's kind counterpart: The dawn broke dim on Rose Mary's soul,— No hill-crown's heavenly aureole, But a wild gleam on a shaken shoal. Her senses gasped in the sudden air, And she looked around, but none was there. She felt the slackening frost distil Through her blood the last ooze dull and chill: Her lids were dry and her lips were still. Her tears had flooded her heart again; As after a long day's bitter rain, At dusk when the wet flower-cups shrink, The drops run in from the beaded brink, And all the close-shut petals drink. Again her sighs on her heart were rolled; As the wind that long has swept the wold,— Whose moan was made with the moaning sea,— Beats out its breath in the last torn tree, And sinks at length in lethargy. She knew she had waded bosom-deep Along death's bank in the sedge of sleep: All else was lost to her clouded mind; Nor, looking back, could she see defin'd O'er the dim dumb waste what lay behind. Slowly fades the sun from the wall Till day lies dead on the sun-dial: And now in Rose Mary's lifted eye 'Twas shadow alone that made reply To the set face of the soul's dark sky. Yet still through her soul there wandered past Dread phantoms borne on a wailing blast,— Death and sorrow and sin and shame; And, murmured still, to her lips there came Her mother's and her lover's name. How to ask, and what thing to know? She might not stay and she dared not go. From fires unseen these smoke-clouds curled; But where did the hidden curse lie furled? And how to seek through the weary world? With toiling breath she rose from the floor And dragged her steps to an open door: 'Twas the secret panel standing wide, As the lady's hand had let it bide In hastening back to her daughter's side. She passed, but reeled with a dizzy brain And smote the door which closed again. She stood within by the darkling stair, But her feet might mount more freely there,— 'Twas the open light most blinded her. Within her mind no wonder grew At the secret path she never knew: All ways alike were strange to her now,— One field bare-ridged from the spirit's plough, One thicket black with the cypress-bough. Once she thought that she heard her name; And she paused, but knew not whence it came. Down the shadowed stair a faint ray fell That guided the weary footsteps well Till it led her up to the altar-cell. No change there was on Rose Mary's face As she leaned in the portal's narrow space: Still she stood by the pillar's stem, Hand and bosom and garment's hem, As the soul stands by at the requiem. The altar-cell was a dome low-lit, And a veil hung in the midst of it: At the pole-points of its circling girth Four symbols stood of the world's first birth,— Air and water and fire and earth. To the north, a fountain glittered free; To the south, there glowed a red fruit-tree; To the east, a lamp flamed high and fair; To the west, a crystal casket rare Held fast a cloud of the fields of air. The painted walls were a mystic show Of time's ebb-tide and overflow; His hoards long-locked and conquering key, His service-fires that in heaven be, And earth-wheels whirled perpetually. Rose Mary gazed from the open door As on idle things she cared not for,— The fleeting shapes of an empty tale; Then stepped with a heedless visage pale, And lifted aside the altar-veil. The altar stood from its curved recess In a coiling serpent's life-likeness: Even such a serpent evermore Lies deep asleep at the world's dark core Till the last Voice shake the sea and shore. From the altar-cloth a book rose spread And tapers burned at the altar-head; And there in the altar-midst alone, 'Twixt wings of a sculptured beast unknown, Rose Mary saw the Beryl-stone. Firm it sat 'twixt the hollowed wings, As an orb sits in the hand of kings: And lo! for that Foe whose curse far-flown Had bound her life with a burning zone, Rose Mary knew the Beryl-stone. Dread is the meteor's blazing sphere When the poles throb to its blind career; But not with a light more grim and ghast Thereby is the future doom forecast, Than now this sight brought back the past. The hours and minutes seemed to whirr In a clanging swarm that deafened her; They stung her heart to a writhing flame, And marshalled past in its glare they came,— Death and sorrow and sin and shame. Round the Beryl's sphere she saw them pass And mock her eyes from the fated glass: One by one in a fiery train The dead hours seemed to wax and wane, And burned till all was known again. From the drained heart's fount there rose no cry, There sprang no tears, for the source was dry. Held in the hand of some heavy law, Her eyes she might not once withdraw, Nor shrink away from the thing she saw. Even as she gazed, through all her blood The flame was quenched in a coming flood: Out of the depth of the hollow gloom On her soul's bare sands she felt it boom,— The measured tide of a sea of doom. Three steps she took through the altar-gate, And her neck reared and her arms grew straight: The sinews clenched like a serpent's throe, And the face was white in the dark hair's flow, As her hate beheld what lay below. Dumb she stood in her malisons,— A silver statue tressed with bronze: As the fabled head by Perseus mown, It seemed in sooth that her gaze alone Had turned the carven shapes to stone. O'er the altar-sides on either hand There hung a dinted helm and brand: By strength thereof, 'neath the Sacred Sign, That bitter gift o'er the salt sea-brine Her father brought from Palestine. Rose Mary moved with a stern accord And reached her hand to her father's sword; Nor did she stir her gaze one whit From the thing whereon her brows were knit; But gazing still, she spoke to it. “O ye, three times accurst,” she said, “By whom this stone is tenanted! Lo! here ye came by a strong sin's might; Yet a sinner's hand that's weak to smite Shall send you hence ere the day be night. “This hour a clear voice bade me know My hand shall work your overthrow: Another thing in mine ear it spake,— With the broken spell my life shall break. I thank Thee, God, for the dear death's sake! “And he Thy heavenly minister Who swayed erewhile this spell-bound sphere,— My parting soul let him haste to greet, And none but he be guide for my feet To where Thy rest is made complete.” Then deep she breathed, with a tender moan:— “My love, my lord, my only one! Even as I held the cursed clue, When thee, through me, these foul ones slew,— By mine own deed shall they slay me too! “Even while they speed to Hell, my love, Two hearts shall meet in Heaven above. Our shrift thou sought'st, but might'st not bring: And oh! for me 'tis a blessed thing To work hereby our ransoming. “One were our hearts in joy and pain, And our souls e'en now grow one again. And O my love, if our souls are three, O thine and mine shall the third soul be,— One threefold love eternally.” Her eyes were soft as she spoke apart, And the lips smiled to the broken heart: But the glance was dark and the forehead scored With the bitter frown of hate restored, As her two hands swung the heavy sword. Three steps back from her Foe she trod:— “Love, for thy sake! In Thy Name, O God!” In the fair white hands small strength was shown; Yet the blade flashed high and the edge fell prone, And she cleft the heart of the Beryl-stone. What living flesh in the thunder-cloud Hath sat and felt heaven cry aloud? Or known how the levin's pulse may beat? Or wrapped the hour when the whirlwinds meet About its breast for a winding-sheet? Who hath crouched at the world's deep heart While the earthquake rends its loins apart? Or walked far under the seething main While overhead the heavens ordain The tempest-towers of the hurricane? Who hath seen or what ear hath heard The secret things unregister'd Of the place where all is past and done, And tears and laughter sound as one In Hell's unhallowed unison? Nay, is it writ how the fiends despair In earth and water and fire and air? Even so no mortal tongue may tell How to the clang of the sword that fell The echoes shook the altar-cell. When all was still on the air again The Beryl-stone lay cleft in twain; The veil was rent from the riven dome; And every wind that's winged to roam Might have the ruined place for home. The fountain no more glittered free; The fruit hung dead on the leafless tree; The flame of the lamp had ceased to flare; And the crystal casket shattered there Was emptied now of its cloud of air. And lo! on the ground Rose Mary lay, With a cold brow like the snows ere May, With a cold breast like the earth till Spring, With such a smile as the June days bring When the year grows warm with harvesting. The death she had won might leave no trace On the soft sweet form and gentle face: In a gracious sleep she seemed to lie; And over her head her hand on high Held fast the sword she triumphed by. 'Twas then a clear voice said in the room:— “Behold the end of the heavy doom. O come,— for thy bitter love's sake blest; By a sweet path now thou journeyest, And I will lead thee to thy rest. “Me thy sin by Heaven's sore ban Did chase erewhile from the talisman: But to my heart, as a conquered home, In glory of strength thy footsteps come Who hast thus cast forth my foes therefrom. “Already thy heart remembereth No more his name thou sought'st in death: For under all deeps, all heights above,— So wide the gulf in the midst thereof,— Are Hell of Treason and Heaven of Love. “Thee, true soul, shall thy truth prefer To blessed Mary's rose-bower: Warmed and lit is thy place afar With guerdon-fires of the sweet Love-star Where hearts of steadfast lovers are:— “Though naught for the poor corpse lying here Remain to-day but the cold white bier, But burial-chaunt and bended knee, But sighs and tears that heaviest be, But rent rose-flower and rosemary.” Beryl-Song We, cast forth from the Beryl, Gyre-circling spirits of fire, Whose pangs begin With God's grace to sin, For whose spent powers the immortal hours are sterile,— Woe! must We behold this mother Find grace in her dead child's face, and doubt of none other But that perfect pardon, alas! hath assured her guerdon? Woe! must We behold this daughter, Made clean from the soil of sin wherewith We had fraught her, Shake off a man's blood like water? Write up her story On the Gate of Heaven's glory, Whom there We behold so fair in shining apparel, And beneath her the ruin Of our own undoing! Alas, the Beryl! We had for a foeman But one weak woman; In one day's strife, Her hope fell dead from her life; And yet no iron, Her soul to environ, Could this manslayer, this false soothsayer imperil! Lo, where she bows In the Holy House! Who now shall dissever her soul from its joy for ever While every ditty Of love and plentiful pity Fills the White City, And the floor of Heaven to her feet for ever is given? Hark, a voice cries “Flee!” Woe! woe! what shelter have We, Whose pangs begin With God's grace to sin, For whose spent powers the immortal hours are sterile, Gyre-circling spirits of fire, We, cast forth from the Beryl? THE WHITE SHIP Henry I. of England.—25th November1120 By none but me can the tale be told, The butcher of Rouen, poor Berold. (Lands are swayed by a King on a throne.) 'Twas a royal train put forth to sea, Yet the tale can be told by none but me. (The sea hath no King but God alone.) King Henry held it as life's whole gain That after his death his son should reign. 'Twas so in my youth I heard men say, And my old age calls it back to-day. King Henry of England's realm was he, And Henry Duke of Normandy. The times had changed when on either coast “Clerkly Harry” was all his boast. Of ruthless strokes full many an one He had struck to crown himself and his son; And his elder brother's eyes were gone. And when to the chase his court would crowd, The poor flung ploughshares on his road, And shrieked: “Our cry is from King to God!” But all the chiefs of the English land Had knelt and kissed the Prince's hand. And next with his son he sailed to France To claim the Norman allegiance: And every baron in Normandy Had taken the oath of fealty. 'Twas sworn and sealed, and the day had come When the King and the Prince might journey home: For Christmas cheer is to home hearts dear, And Christmas now was drawing near. Stout Fitz-Stephen came to the King,— A pilot famous in seafaring; And he held to the King, in all men's sight, A mark of gold for his tribute's right. “Liege Lord! my father guided the ship From whose boat your father's foot did slip When he caught the English soil in his grip, “And cried: ‘By this clasp I claim command O'er every rood of English land!’ “He was borne to the realm you rule o'er now In that ship with the archer carved at her prow: “And thither I'll bear, an it be my due, Your father's son and his grandson too. “The famed White Ship is mine in the bay; From Harfleur's harbour she sails to-day, “With masts fair-pennoned as Norman spears And with fifty well-tried mariners.” Quoth the King: “My ships are chosen each one, But I'll not say nay to Stephen's son. “My son and daughter and fellowship Shall cross the water in the White Ship.” The King set sail with the eve's south wind, And soon he left that coast behind. The Prince and all his, a princely show, Remained in the good White Ship to go. With noble knights and with ladies fair, With courtiers and sailors gathered there, Three hundred living souls we were: And I Berold was the meanest hind In all that train to the Prince assign'd. The Prince was a lawless shameless youth; From his father's loins he sprang without ruth: Eighteen years till then he had seen, And the devil's dues in him were eighteen. And now he cried: “Bring wine from below; Let the sailors revel ere yet they row: “Our speed shall o'ertake my father's flight Though we sail from the harbour at midnight.” The rowers made good cheer without check; The lords and ladies obeyed his beck; The night was light, and they danced on the deck. But at midnight's stroke they cleared the bay, And the White Ship furrowed the water-way. The sails were set, and the oars kept tune To the double flight of the ship and the moon: Swifter and swifter the White Ship sped Till she flew as the spirit flies from the dead: As white as a lily glimmered she Like a ship's fair ghost upon the sea. And the Prince cried, “Friends, 'tis the hour to sing! Is a songbird's course so swift on the wing?” And under the winter stars' still throng, From brown throats, white throats, merry and strong, The knights and the ladies raised a song. A song,—nay, a shriek that rent the sky, That leaped o'er the deep!—the grievous cry Of three hundred living that now must die. An instant shriek that sprang to the shock As the ship's keel felt the sunken rock. 'Tis said that afar—a shrill strange sigh— The King's ships heard it and knew not why. Pale Fitz-Stephen stood by the helm 'Mid all those folk that the waves must whelm. A great King's heir for the waves to whelm, And the helpless pilot pale at the helm! The ship was eager and sucked athirst, By the stealthy stab of the sharp reef pierc'd: And like the moil round a sinking cup The waters against her crowded up. A moment the pilot's senses spin,— The next he snatched the Prince 'mid the din, Cut the boat loose, and the youth leaped in. A few friends leaped with him, standing near. “Row! the sea's smooth and the night is clear!” “What! none to be saved but these and I?” “Row, row as you'd live! All here must die!” Out of the churn of the choking ship, Which the gulf grapples and the waves strip, They struck with the strained oars' flash and dip. 'Twas then o'er the splitting bulwarks' brim The Prince's sister screamed to him. He gazed aloft, still rowing apace, And through the whirled surf he knew her face. To the toppling decks clave one and all As a fly cleaves to a chamber-wall. I Berold was clinging anear; I prayed for myself and quaked with fear, But I saw his eyes as he looked at her. He knew her face and he heard her cry, And he said, “Put back! she must not die!” And back with the current's force they reel Like a leaf that's drawn to a water-wheel. 'Neath the ship's travail they scarce might float, But he rose and stood in the rocking boat. Low the poor ship leaned on the tide: O'er the naked keel as she best might slide, The sister toiled to the brother's side. He reached an oar to her from below, And stiffened his arms to clutch her so. But now from the ship some spied the boat, And “Saved!” was the cry from many a throat. And down to the boat they leaped and fell: It turned as a bucket turns in a well, And nothing was there but the surge and swell. The Prince that was and the King to come, There in an instant gone to his doom, Despite of all England's bended knee And maugre the Norman fealty! He was a Prince of lust and pride; He showed no grace till the hour he died. When he should be King, he oft would vow, He'd yoke the peasant to his own plough. O'er him the ships score their furrows now. God only knows where his soul did wake, But I saw him die for his sister's sake. By none but me can the tale be told, The butcher of Rouen, poor Berold. (Lands are swayed by a King on a throne.) 'Twas a royal train put forth to sea, Yet the tale can be told by none but me. (The sea hath no King but God alone.) And now the end came o'er the waters' womb Like the last great Day that's yet to come. With prayers in vain and curses in vain, The White Ship sundered on the mid-main: And what were men and what was a ship Were toys and splinters in the sea's grip. I Berold was down in the sea; And passing strange though the thing may be, Of dreams then known I remember me. Blithe is the shout on Harfleur's strand When morning lights the sails to land: And blithe is Honfleur's echoing gloam When mothers call the children home: And high do the bells of Rouen beat When the Body of Christ goes down the street. These things and the like were heard and shown In a moment's trance 'neath the sea alone; And when I rose, 'twas the sea did seem, And not these things, to be all a dream. The ship was gone and the crowd was gone, And the deep shuddered and the moon shone, And in a strait grasp my arms did span The mainyard rent from the mast where it ran; And on it with me was another man. Where lands were none 'neath the dim sea-sky, We told our names, that man and I. “O I am Godefroy de l'Aigle hight, And son I am to a belted knight.” “And I am Berold the butcher's son Who slays the beasts in Rouen town.” Then cried we upon God's name, as we Did drift on the bitter winter sea. But lo! a third man rose o'er the wave, And we said, “Thank God! us three may He save!” He clutched to the yard with panting stare, And we looked and knew Fitz-Stephen there. He clung, and “What of the Prince?” quoth he. “Lost, lost!” we cried. He cried, “Woe on me!” And loosed his hold and sank through the sea. And soul with soul again in that space We two were together face to face: And each knew each, as the moments sped, Less for one living than for one dead: And every still star overhead Seemed an eye that knew we were but dead. And the hours passed; till the noble's son Sighed, “God be thy help! my strength's foredone! “O farewell, friend, for I can no more!” “Christ take thee!” I moaned; and his life was o'er. Three hundred souls were all lost but one, And I drifted over the sea alone. At last the morning rose on the sea Like an angel's wing that beat tow'rds me. Sore numbed I was in my sheepskin coat; Half dead I hung, and might nothing note, Till I woke sun-warmed in a fisher-boat. The sun was high o'er the eastern brim As I praised God and gave thanks to Him. That day I told my tale to a priest, Who charged me, till the shrift were releas'd, That I should keep it in mine own breast. And with the priest I thence did fare To King Henry's court at Winchester. We spoke with the King's high chamberlain, And he wept and mourned again and again, As if his own son had been slain: And round us ever there crowded fast Great men with faces all aghast: And who so bold that might tell the thing Which now they knew to their lord the King? Much woe I learnt in their communing. The King had watched with a heart sore stirred For two whole days, and this was the third: And still to all his court would he say, “What keeps my son so long away?” And they said: “The ports lie far and wide That skirt the swell of the English tide; “And England's cliffs are not more white Than her women are, and scarce so light Her skies as their eyes are blue and bright; “And in some port that he reached from France The Prince has lingered for his pleasaùnce.” But once the King asked: “What distant cry Was that we heard 'twixt the sea and sky?” And one said: “With suchlike shouts, pardie! Do the fishers fling their nets at sea.” And one: “Who knows not the shrieking quest When the sea-mew misses its young from the nest?” 'Twas thus till now they had soothed his dread, Albeit they knew not what they said: But who should speak to-day of the thing That all knew there except the King? Then pondering much they found a way, And met round the King's high seat that day: And the King sat with a heart sore stirred, And seldom he spoke and seldom heard. 'Twas then through the hall the King was 'ware Of a little boy with golden hair, As bright as the golden poppy is That the beach breeds for the surf to kiss: Yet pale his cheek as the thorn in Spring, And his garb black like the raven's wing. Nothing heard but his foot through the hall, For now the lords were silent all. And the King wondered, and said, “Alack! Who sends me a fair boy dressed in black? “Why, sweet heart, do you pace through the hall As though my court were a funeral?” Then lowly knelt the child at the dais, And looked up weeping in the King's face. “O wherefore black, O King, ye may say, For white is the hue of death to-day. “Your son and all his fellowship Lie low in the sea with the White Ship.” King Henry fell as a man struck dead; And speechless still he stared from his bed When to him next day my rede I read. There's many an hour must needs beguile A King's high heart that he should smile,— Full many a lordly hour, full fain Of his realm's rule and pride of his reign:— But this King never smiled again. By none but me can the tale be told, The butcher of Rouen, poor Berold. (Lands are swayed by a King on a throne.) 'Twas a royal train put forth to sea, Yet the tale can be told by none but me. (The sea hath no King but God alone.) THE KING'S TRAGEDY James I. of Scots.—20th February 1437 NOTE Tradition says that Catherine Douglas, in honour of her heroic act when she barred the door with her arm against the murderers of James the First of Scots, received popularly the name of “Barlass.” This name remains to her descendants, the Barlas family, in Scotland, who bear for their crest a broken arm. She married Alexander Lovell of Bolunnie. A few stanzas from King James's lovely poem, known as The King's Quair, are quoted in the course of this ballad. The writer must express regret for the necessity which has compelled him to shorten the ten-syllabled lines to eight syllables, in order that they might harmonise with the ballad metre. I Catherine am a Douglas born, A name to all Scots dear; And Kate Barlass they've called me now Through many a waning year. This old arm's withered now. 'Twas once Most deft 'mong maidens all To rein the steed, to wing the shaft, To smite the palm-play ball. In hall adown the close-linked dance It has shone most white and fair; It has been the rest for a true lord's head, And many a sweet babe's nursing-bed, And the bar to a King's chambère. Aye, lasses, draw round Kate Barlass, And hark with bated breath How good King James, King Robert's son, Was foully done to death. Through all the days of his gallant youth The princely James was pent, By his friends at first and then by his foes, In long imprisonment. For the elder Prince, the kingdom's heir, By treason's murderous brood Was slain; and the father quaked for the child With the royal mortal blood. I' the Bass Rock fort, by his father's care, Was his childhood's life assured; And Henry the subtle Bolingbroke, Proud England's King, 'neath the southron yoke His youth for long years immured. Yet in all things meet for a kingly man Himself did he approve; And the nightingale through his prison-wall Taught him both lore and love. For once, when the bird's song drew him close To the opened window-pane, In her bower beneath a lady stood, A light of life to his sorrowful mood, Like a lily amid the rain. And for her sake, to the sweet bird's note, He framed a sweeter Song, More sweet than ever a poet's heart Gave yet to the English tongue. She was a lady of royal blood; And when, past sorrow and teen, He stood where still through his crownless years His Scotish realm had been, At Scone were the happy lovers crowned, A heart-wed King and Queen. But the bird may fall from the bough of youth, And song be turned to moan, And Love's storm-cloud be the shadow of Hate, When the tempest-waves of a troubled State Are beating against a throne. Yet well they loved; and the god of Love, Whom well the King had sung, Might find on the earth no truer hearts His lowliest swains among. From the days when first she rode abroad With Scotish maids in her train, I Catherine Douglas won the trust Of my mistress sweet Queen Jane. And oft she sighed, “To be born a King!” And oft along the way When she saw the homely lovers pass She has said, “Alack the day!” Years waned,—the loving and toiling years: Till England's wrong renewed Drove James, by outrage cast on his crown, To the open field of feud. 'Twas when the King and his host were met At the leaguer of Roxbro' hold, The Queen o'the sudden sought his camp With a tale of dread to be told. And she showed him a secret letter writ That spoke of treasonous strife, And how a band of his noblest lords Were sworn to take his life. “And it may be here or it may be there, In the camp or the court,” she said: “But for my sake come to your people's arms And guard your royal head.” Quoth he, “'Tis the fifteenth day of the siege, And the castle's nigh to yield.” “O face your foes on your throne,” she cried, “And show the power you wield; And under your Scotish people's love You shall sit as under your shield.” At the fair Queen's side I stood that day When he bade them raise the siege, And back to his Court he sped to know How the lords would meet their Liege. But when he summoned his Parliament, The louring brows hung round, Like clouds that circle the mountain-head Ere the first low thunders sound. For he had tamed the nobles' lust And curbed their power and pride, And reached out an arm to right the poor Through Scotland far and wide; And many a lordly wrong-doer By the headsman's axe had died. 'Twas then upspoke Sir Robert Græme, The bold o'ermastering man:— “O King, in the name of your Three Estates I set you under their ban! “For, as your lords made oath to you Of service and fealty, Even in like wise you pledged your oath Their faithful sire to be:— “Yet all we here that are nobly sprung Have mourned dear kith and kin Since first for the Scotish Barons' curse Did your bloody rule begin.” With that he laid his hands on his King:— “Is this not so, my lords?” But of all who had sworn to league with him Not one spake back to his words. Quoth the King:—“Thou speak'st but for one Estate, Nor doth it avow thy gage. Let my liege lords hale this traitor hence!” The Græme fired dark with rage:— “Who works for lesser men than himself, He earns but a witless wage!” But soon from the dungeon where he lay He won by privy plots, And forth he fled with a price on his head To the country of the Wild Scots. And word there came from Sir Robert Græme To the King at Edinbro':— “No Liege of mine thou art; but I see From this day forth alone in thee God's creature, my mortal foe. “Through thee are my wife and children lost, My heritage and lands; And when my God shall show me a way, Thyself my mortal foe will I slay With these my proper hands.” Against the coming of Christmastide That year the King bade call I'the Black Friars' Charterhouse of Perth A solemn festival. And we of his household rode with him In a close-ranked company; But not till the sun had sunk from his throne Did we reach the Scotish Sea. That eve was clenched for a boding storm, 'Neath a toilsome moon half seen; The cloud stooped low and the surf rose high; And where there was a line of the sky, Wild wings loomed dark between. And on a rock of the black beach-side, By the veiled moon dimly lit, There was something seemed to heave with life As the King drew nigh to it. And was it only the tossing furze Or brake of the waste sea-wold? Or was it an eagle bent to the blast? When near we came, we knew it at last For a woman tattered and old. But it seemed as though by a fire within Her writhen limbs were wrung; And as soon as the King was close to her, She stood up gaunt and strong. 'Twas then the moon sailed clear of the rack On high in her hollow dome; And still as aloft with hoary crest Each clamorous wave rang home, Like fire in snow the moonlight blazed Amid the champing foam. And the woman held his eyes with her eyes:— “O King, thou art come at last; But thy wraith has haunted the Scotish Sea To my sight for four years past. “Four years it is since first I met, 'Twixt the Duchray and the Dhu, A shape whose feet clung close in a shroud, And that shape for thine I knew. “A year again, and on Inchkeith Isle I saw thee pass in the breeze, With the cerecloth risen above thy feet And wound about thy knees. “And yet a year, in the Links of Forth, As a wanderer without rest, Thou cam'st with both thine arms i'the shroud That clung high up thy breast. “And in this hour I find thee here, And well mine eyes may note That the winding-sheet hath passed thy breast And risen around thy throat. “And when I meet thee again, O King, That of death hast such sore drouth,— Except thou turn again on this shore,— The winding-sheet shall have moved once more And covered thine eyes and mouth. “O King, whom poor men bless for their King, Of thy fate be not so fain; But these my words for God's message take, And turn thy steed, O King, for her sake Who rides beside thy rein!” While the woman spoke, the King's horse reared As if it would breast the sea, And the Queen turned pale as she heard on the gale The voice die dolorously. When the woman ceased, the steed was still, But the King gazed on her yet, And in silence save for the wail of the sea His eyes and her eyes met. At last he said:—“God's ways are His own; Man is but shadow and dust. Last night I prayed by His altar-stone; To-night I wend to the Feast of His Son; And in Him I set my trust. “I have held my people in sacred charge, And have not feared the sting Of proud men's hate,—to His will resign'd Who has but one same death for a hind And one same death for a King. “And if God in His wisdom have brought close The day when I must die, That day by water or fire or air My feet shall fall in the destined snare Wherever my road may lie. “What man can say but the Fiend hath set Thy sorcery on my path, My heart with the fear of death to fill, And turn me against God's very will To sink in His burning wrath?” The woman stood as the train rode past, And moved nor limb nor eye; And when we were shipped, we saw her there Still standing against the sky. As the ship made way, the moon once more Sank slow in her rising pall; And I thought of the shrouded wraith of the King, And I said, “The Heavens know all.” And now, ye lasses, must ye hear How my name is Kate Barlass:— But a little thing, when all the tale Is told of the weary mass Of crime and woe which in Scotland's realm God's will let come to pass. 'Twas in the Charterhouse of Perth That the King and all his Court Were met, the Christmas Feast being done, For solace and disport. 'Twas a wind-wild eve in February, And against the casement-pane The branches smote like summoning hands, And muttered the driving rain. And when the wind swooped over the lift And made the whole heaven frown, It seemed a grip was laid on the walls To tug the housetop down. And the Queen was there, more stately fair Than a lily in garden set; And the King was loth to stir from her side; For as on the day when she was his bride, Even so he loved her yet. And the Earl of Athole, the King's false friend, Sat with him at the board; And Robert Stuart the chamberlain Who had sold his sovereign Lord. Yet the traitor Christopher Chaumber there Would fain have told him all, And vainly four times that night he strove To reach the King through the hall. But the wine is bright at the goblet's brim Though the poison lurk beneath; And the apples still are red on the tree Within whose shade may the adder be That shall turn thy life to death. There was a knight of the King's fast friends Whom he called the King of Love; And to such bright cheer and courtesy That name might best behove. And the King and Queen both loved him well For his gentle knightliness; And with him the King, as that eve wore on, Was playing at the chess. And the King said, (for he thought to jest And soothe the Queen thereby;)— “In a book 'tis writ that this same year A King shall in Scotland die. “And I have pondered the matter o'er, And this have I found, Sir Hugh,— There are but two Kings on Scotish ground, And those Kings are I and you. “And I have a wife and a newborn heir, And you are yourself alone; So stand you stark at my side with me To guard our double throne. “For here sit I and my wife and child, As well your heart shall approve, In full surrender and soothfastness, Beneath your Kingdom of Love.” And the Knight laughed, and the Queen too smiled; But I knew her heavy thought, And I strove to find in the good King's jest What cheer might thence be wrought. And I said, “My Liege, for the Queen's dear love Now sing the song that of old You made, when a captive Prince you lay, And the nightingale sang sweet on the spray, In Windsor's castle-hold.” Then he smiled the smile I knew so well When he thought to please the Queen; The smile which under all bitter frowns Of fate that rose between For ever dwelt at the poet's heart Like the bird of love unseen. And he kissed her hand and took his harp, And the music sweetly rang; And when the song burst forth, it seemed 'Twas the nightingale that sang. “Worship, ye lovers, on this May: Of bliss your kalends are begun: Sing with us, Away, Winter, away! Come, Summer, the sweet season and sun! Awake for shame,—your heaven is won,— And amorously your heads lift all: Thank Love, that you to his grace doth call!” But when he bent to the Queen, and sang The speech whose praise was hers, It seemed his voice was the voice of the Spring And the voice of the bygone years. “The fairest and the freshest flower That ever I saw before that hour, The which o'the sudden made to start The blood of my body to my heart. Ah sweet, are ye a worldly creature Or heavenly thing in form of nature?” And the song was long, and richly stored With wonder and beauteous things; And the harp was tuned to every change Of minstrel ministerings; But when he spoke of the Queen at the last, Its strings were his own heart-strings. “Unworthy but only of her grace, Upon Love's rock that's easy and sure, In guerdon of all my lovè's space She took me her humble creäture. Thus fell my blissful aventure In youth of love that from day to day Flowereth aye new, and further I say. “To reckon all the circumstance As it happed when lessen gan my sore, Of my rancour and woful chance, It were too long,—I have done therefor. And of this flower I say no more, But unto my help her heart hath tended And even from death her man defended.” “Aye, even from death,” to myself I said; For I thought of the day when she Had borne him the news, at Roxbro' siege, Of the fell confederacy. But Death even then took aim as he sang With an arrow deadly bright; And the grinning skull lurked grimly aloof, And the wings were spread far over the roof More dark than the winter night. Yet truly along the amorous song Of Love's high pomp and state, There were words of Fortune's trackless doom And the dreadful face of Fate. And oft have I heard again in dreams The voice of dire appeal In which the King then sang of the pit That is under Fortune's wheel. “And under the wheel beheld I there An ugly Pit as deep as hell, That to behold I quaked for fear: And this I heard, that who therein fell Came no more up, tidings to tell: Whereat, astound of the fearful sight, I wist not what to do for fright.” And oft has my thought called up again These words of the changeful song:— “Wist thou thy pain and thy travàil To come, well might'st thou weep and wail!” And our wail, O God! is long. But the song's end was all of his love; And well his heart was grac'd With her smiling lips and her tear-bright eyes As his arm went round her waist. And on the swell of her long fair throat Close clung the necklet-chain As he bent her pearl-tir'd head aside, And in the warmth of his love and pride He kissed her lips full fain. And her true face was a rosy red, The very red of the rose That, couched on the happy garden-bed, In the summer sunlight glows. And all the wondrous things of love That sang so sweet through the song Were in the look that met in their eyes, And the look was deep and long. 'Twas then a knock came at the outer gate, And the usher sought the King. “The woman you met by the Scotish Sea, My Liege, would tell you a thing; And she says that her present need for speech Will bear no gainsaying.” And the King said: “The hour is late; To-morrow will serve, I ween.” Then he charged the usher strictly, and said: “No word of this to the Queen.” But the usher came again to the King. “Shall I call her back?” quoth he: “For as she went on her way, she cried, ‘Woe! Woe! then the thing must be!’” And the King paused, but he did not speak. Then he called for the Voidee-cup: And as we heard the twelfth hour strike, There by true lips and false lips alike Was the draught of trust drained up. So with reverence meet to King and Queen, To bed went all from the board; And the last to leave of the courtly train Was Robert Stuart the chamberlain Who had sold his sovereign lord. And all the locks of the chamber-door Had the traitor riven and brast; And that Fate might win sure way from afar, He had drawn out every bolt and bar That made the entrance fast. And now at midnight he stole his way To the moat of the outer wall, And laid strong hurdles closely across Where the traitors' tread should fall. But we that were the Queen's bower-maids Alone were left behind; And with heed we drew the curtains close Against the winter wind. And now that all was still through the hall, More clearly we heard the rain That clamoured ever against the glass And the boughs that beat on the pane. But the fire was bright in the ingle-nook, And through empty space around The shadows cast on the arras'd wall 'Mid the pictured kings stood sudden and tall Like spectres sprung from the ground. And the bed was dight in a deep alcove; And as he stood by the fire The King was still in talk with the Queen While he doffed his goodly attire. And the song had brought the image back Of many a bygone year; And many a loving word they said With hand in hand and head laid to head; And none of us went anear. But Love was weeping outside the house, A child in the piteous rain; And as he watched the arrow of Death, He wailed for his own shafts close in the sheath That never should fly again. And now beneath the window arose A wild voice suddenly: And the King reared straight, but the Queen fell back As for bitter dule to dree; And all of us knew the woman's voice Who spoke by the Scotish Sea. “O King,” she cried, “in an evil hour They drove me from thy gate; And yet my voice must rise to thine ears; But alas! it comes too late! “Last night at mid-watch, by Aberdour, When the moon was dead in the skies, O King, in a death-light of thine own I saw thy shape arise. “And in full season, as erst I said, The doom had gained its growth; And the shroud had risen above thy neck And covered thine eyes and mouth. “And no moon woke, but the pale dawn broke, And still thy soul stood there; And I thought its silence cried to my soul As the first rays crowned its hair. “Since then have I journeyed fast and fain In very despite of Fate, Lest Hope might still be found in God's will: But they drove me from thy gate. “For every man on God's ground, O King, His death grows up from his birth In a shadow-plant perpetually; And thine towers high, a black yew-tree, O'er the Charterhouse of Perth!” That room was built far out from the house; And none but we in the room Might hear the voice that rose beneath, Nor the tread of the coming doom. For now there came a torchlight-glare, And a clang of arms there came; And not a soul in that space but thought Of the foe Sir Robert Græme. Yea, from the country of the Wild Scots, O'er mountain, valley, and glen, He had brought with him in murderous league Three hundred armèd men. The King knew all in an instant's flash; And like a King did he stand; But there was no armour in all the room, Nor weapon lay to his hand. And all we women flew to the door And thought to have made it fast; But the bolts were gone and the bars were gone And the locks were riven and brast. And he caught the pale pale Queen in his arms As the iron footsteps fell,— Then loosed her, standing alone, and said, “Our bliss was our farewell!” And 'twixt his lips he murmured a prayer, And he crossed his brow and breast; And proudly in royal hardihood Even so with folded arms he stood,— The prize of the bloody quest. Then on me leaped the Queen like a deer:— “O Catherine, help!” she cried. And low at his feet we clasped his knees Together side by side. “Oh! even a King, for his people's sake, From treasonous death must hide!” “For her sake most!” I cried, and I marked The pang that my words could wring. And the iron tongs from the chimney-nook I snatched and held to the king:— “Wrench up the plank! and the vault beneath Shall yield safe harbouring.” With brows low-bent, from my eager hand The heavy heft did he take; And the plank at his feet he wrenched and tore; And as he frowned through the open floor, Again I said, “For her sake!” Then he cried to the Queen, “God's will be done!” For her hands were clasped in prayer. And down he sprang to the inner crypt; And straight we closed the plank he had ripp'd And toiled to smooth it fair. (Alas! in that vault a gap once was Wherethro' the King might have fled: But three days since close-walled had it been By his will; for the ball would roll therein When without at the palm he play'd.) Then the Queen cried, “Catherine, keep the door, And I to this will suffice!” At her word I rose all dazed to my feet, And my heart was fire and ice. And louder ever the voices grew, And the tramp of men in mail; Until to my brain it seemed to be As though I tossed on a ship at sea In the teeth of a crashing gale. Then back I flew to the rest; and hard We strove with sinews knit To force the table against the door; But we might not compass it. Then my wild gaze sped far down the hall To the place of the hearthstone-sill; And the Queen bent ever above the floor, For the plank was rising still. And now the rush was heard on the stair, And “God, what help?” was our cry. And was I frenzied or was I bold? I looked at each empty stanchion-hold, And no bar but my arm had I! Like iron felt my arm, as through The staple I made it pass:— Alack! it was flesh and bone—no more! 'Twas Catherine Douglas sprang to the door, But I fell back Kate Barlass. With that they all thronged into the hall, Half dim to my failing ken; And the space that was but a void before Was a crowd of wrathful men. Behind the door I had fall'n and lay, Yet my sense was wildly aware, And for all the pain of my shattered arm I never fainted there. Even as I fell, my eyes were cast Where the King leaped down to the pit; And lo! the plank was smooth in its place, And the Queen stood far from it. And under the litters and through the bed And within the presses all The traitors sought for the King, and pierced The arras around the wall. And through the chamber they ramped and stormed Like lions loose in the lair, And scarce could trust to their very eyes,— For behold! no King was there. Then one of them seized the Queen, and cried,— “Now tell us, where is thy lord?” And he held the sharp point over her heart: She drooped not her eyes nor did she start, But she answered never a word. Then the sword half pierced the true true breast: But it was the Græme's own son Cried, “This is a woman,—we seek a man!” And away from her girdle-zone He struck the point of the murderous steel; And that foul deed was not done. And forth flowed all the throng like a sea And 'twas empty space once more; And my eyes sought out the wounded Queen As I lay behind the door. And I said: “Dear Lady, leave me here, For I cannot help you now: But fly while you may, and none shall reck Of my place here lying low.” And she said, “My Catherine, God help thee!” Then she looked to the distant floor, And clasping her hands, “O God help him,” She sobbed, “for we can no more!” But God He knows what help may mean, If it mean to live or to die; And what sore sorrow and mighty moan On earth it may cost ere yet a throne Be filled in His house on high. And now the ladies fled with the Queen; And through the open door The night-wind wailed round the empty room And the rushes shook on the floor. And the bed drooped low in the dark recess Whence the arras was rent away; And the firelight still shone over the space Where our hidden secret lay. And the rain had ceased, and the moonbeams lit The window high in the wall,— Bright beams that on the plank that I knew Through the painted pane did fall, And gleamed with the splendour of Scotland's crown And shield armorial. But then a great wind swept up the skies And the climbing moon fell back; And the royal blazon fled from the floor, And nought remained on its track; And high in the darkened window-pane The shield and the crown were black. And what I say next I partly saw And partly I heard in sooth, And partly since from the murderers' lips The torture wrung the truth. For now again came the armèd tread, And fast through the hall it fell; But the throng was less; and ere I saw, By the voice without I could tell That Robert Stuart had come with them Who knew that chamber well. And over the space the Græme strode dark With his mantle round him flung; And in his eye was a flaming light But not a word on his tongue. And Stuart held a torch to the floor, And he found the thing he sought; And they slashed the plank away with their swords; And O God! I fainted not! And the traitor held his torch in the gap, All smoking and smouldering; And through the vapour and fire, beneath In the dark crypt's narrow ring, With a shout that pealed to the room's high roof They saw their naked King. Half naked he stood, but stood as one Who yet could do and dare: With the crown, the King was stript away,— The Knight was 'reft of his battle-array,— But still the Man was there. From the rout then stepped a villain forth,— Sir John Hall was his name; With a knife unsheathed he leapt to the vault Beneath the torchlight-flame. Of his person and stature was the King A man right manly strong, And mightily by the shoulder-blades His foe to his feet he flung. Then the traitor's brother, Sir Thomas Hall, Sprang down to work his worst; And the King caught the second man by the neck And flung him above the first. And he smote and trampled them under him; And a long month thence they bare All black their throats with the grip of his hands When the hangman's hand came there. And sore he strove to have had their knives, But the sharp blades gashed his hands. Oh James! so armed, thou hadst battled there Till help had come of thy bands; And oh! once more thou hadst held our throne And ruled thy Scotish lands! But while the King o'er his foes still raged With a heart that nought could tame, Another man sprang down to the crypt; And with his sword in his hand hard-gripp'd, There stood Sir Robert Græme. (Now shame on the recreant traitor's heart Who durst not face his King Till the body unarmed was wearied out With two-fold combating! Ah! well might the people sing and say, As oft ye have heard aright:— “O Robert Græme, O Robert Græme, Who slew our King, God give thee shame!” For he slew him not as a knight.) And the naked King turned round at bay, But his strength had passed the goal, And he could but gasp:—“Mine hour is come; But oh! to succour thine own soul's doom, Let a priest now shrive my soul!” And the traitor looked on the King's spent strength, And said:—“Have I kept my word?— Yea, King, the mortal pledge that I gave? No black friar's shrift thy soul shall have, But the shrift of this red sword!” With that he smote his King through the breast; And all they three in that pen Fell on him and stabbed and stabbed him there Like merciless murderous men. Yet seemed it now that Sir Robert Græme, Ere the King's last breath was o'er, Turned sick at heart with the deadly sight And would have done no more. But a cry came from the troop above:— “If him thou do not slay, The price of his life that thou dost spare Thy forfeit life shall pay!” O God! what more did I hear or see, Or how should I tell the rest? But there at length our King lay slain With sixteen wounds in his breast. O God! and now did a bell boom forth, And the murderers turned and fled;— Too late, too late, O God, did it sound!— And I heard the true men mustering round, And the cries and the coming tread. But ere they came, to the black death-gap Somewise did I creep and steal; And lo! or ever I swooned away, Through the dusk I saw where the white face lay In the Pit of Fortune's Wheel. And now, ye Scotish maids who have heard Dread things of the days grown old,— Even at the last, of true Queen Jane May somewhat yet be told, And how she dealt for her dear lord's sake Dire vengeance manifold. 'Twas in the Charterhouse of Perth, In the fair-lit Death-chapelle, That the slain King's corpse on bier was laid With chaunt and requiem-knell. And all with royal wealth of balm Was the body purified; And none could trace on the brow and lips The death that he had died. In his robes of state he lay asleep With orb and sceptre in hand; And by the crown he wore on his throne Was his kingly forehead spann'd. And, girls, 'twas a sweet sad thing to see How the curling golden hair, As in the day of the poet's youth, From the King's crown clustered there. And if all had come to pass in the brain That throbbed beneath those curls, Then Scots had said in the days to come That this their soil was a different home And a different Scotland, girls! And the Queen sat by him night and day, And oft she knelt in prayer, All wan and pale in the widow's veil That shrouded her shining hair. And I had got good help of my hurt: And only to me some sign She made; and save the priests that were there, No face would she see but mine. And the month of March wore on apace; And now fresh couriers fared Still from the country of the Wild Scots With news of the traitors snared. And still as I told her day by day, Her pallor changed to sight, And the frost grew to a furnace-flame That burnt her visage white. And evermore as I brought her word, She bent to her dead King James, And in the cold ear with fire-drawn breath She spoke the traitors' names. But when the name of Sir Robert Græme Was the one she had to give, I ran to hold her up from the floor; For the froth was on her lips, and sore I feared that she could not live. And the month of March wore nigh to its end, And still was the death-pall spread; For she would not bury her slaughtered lord Till his slayers all were dead. And now of their dooms dread tidings came, And of torments fierce and dire; And nought she spake,—she had ceased to speak,— But her eyes were a soul on fire. But when I told her the bitter end Of the stern and just award, She leaned o'er the bier, and thrice three times She kissed the lips of her lord. And then she said,—“My King, they are dead!” And she knelt on the chapel-floor, And whispered low with a strange proud smile,— “James, James, they suffered more!” Last she stood up to her queenly height, But she shook like an autumn leaf, As though the fire wherein she burned Then left her body, and all were turned To winter of life-long grief. And “O James!” she said,—“My James!” she said,— “Alas for the woful thing, That a poet true and a friend of man, In desperate days of bale and ban, Should needs be born a King!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II.—MISCELLANEOUS POEMS MY SISTER'S SLEEP She fell asleep on Christmas Eve: At length the long-ungranted shade Of weary eyelids overweigh'd The pain nought else might yet relieve. Our mother, who had leaned all day Over the bed from chime to chime, Then raised herself for the first time, And as she sat her down, did pray. Her little work-table was spread With work to finish. For the glare Made by her candle, she had care To work some distance from the bed. Without, there was a cold moon up, Of winter radiance sheer and thin; The hollow halo it was in Was like an icy crystal cup. Through the small room, with subtle sound Of flame, by vents the fireshine drove And reddened. In its dim alcove The mirror shed a clearness round. I had been sitting up some nights, And my tired mind felt weak and blank; Like a sharp strengthening wine it drank The stillness and the broken lights. Twelve struck. That sound, by dwindling years Heard in each hour, crept off; and then The ruffled silence spread again, Like water that a pebble stirs. Our mother rose from where she sat: Her needles, as she laid them down, Met lightly, and her silken gown Settled: no other noise than that. “Glory unto the Newly Born!” So, as said angels, she did say; Because we were in Christmas Day, Though it would still be long till morn. Just then in the room over us There was a pushing back of chairs, As some who had sat unawares So late, now heard the hour, and rose. With anxious softly-stepping haste Our mother went where Margaret lay, Fearing the sounds o'erhead—should they Have broken her long watched-for rest! She stooped an instant, calm, and turned; But suddenly turned back again; And all her features seemed in pain With woe, and her eyes gazed and yearned. For my part, I but hid my face, And held my breath, and spoke no word: There was none spoken; but I heard The silence for a little space. Our mother bowed herself and wept: And both my arms fell, and I said, “God knows I knew that she was dead.” And there, all white, my sister slept. Then kneeling, upon Christmas morn A little after twelve o'clock, We said, ere the first quarter struck, “Christ's blessing on the newly born!” FOR AN ANNUNCIATION EARLY GERMAN The lilies stand before her like a screen Through which, upon this warm and solemn day, God surely hears. For there she kneels to pray Who wafts our prayers to God—Mary the Queen She was Faith's Present, parting what had been From what began with her, and is for aye. On either hand, God's twofold system lay: With meek bowed face a Virgin prayed between. So prays she, and the Dove flies in to her, And she has turned. At the low porch is one Who looks as though deep awe made him to smile. Heavy with heat, the plants yield shadow there; The loud flies cross each other in the sun; And the aisled pillars meet the poplar-aisle. AVE Mother of the Fair Delight, Thou handmaid perfect in God's sight, Now sitting fourth beside the Three, Thyself a woman-Trinity,— Being a daughter born to God, Mother of Christ from stall to rood, And wife unto the Holy Ghost:— Oh when our need is uttermost, Think that to such as death may strike Thou once wert sister sisterlike! Thou headstone of humanity, Groundstone of the great Mystery, Fashioned like us, yet more than we! Mind'st thou not (when June's heavy breath Warmed the long days in Nazareth,) That eve thou didst go forth to give Thy flowers some drink that they might live One faint night more amid the sands? Far off the trees were as pale wands Against the fervid sky: the sea Sighed further off eternally As human sorrow sighs in sleep. Then suddenly the awe grew deep, As of a day to which all days Were footsteps in God's secret ways: Until a folding sense, like prayer, Which is, as God is, everywhere, Gathered about thee; and a voice Spake to thee without any noise, Being of the silence:—“Hail,” it said, “Thou that art highly favourèd; The Lord is with thee here and now; Blessed among all women thou.” Ah! knew'st thou of the end, when first That Babe was on thy bosom nurs'd?— Or when He tottered round thy knee Did thy great sorrow dawn on thee?— And through His boyhood, year by year Eating with Him the Passover, Didst thou discern confusedly That holier sacrament, when He, The bitter cup about to quaff, Should break the bread and eat thereof?— Or came not yet the knowledge, even Till on some day forecast in Heaven His feet passed through thy door to press Upon His Father's business?— Or still was God's high secret kept? Nay, but I think the whisper crept Like growth through childhood. Work and play, Things common to the course of day, Awed thee with meanings unfulfill'd; And all through girlhood, something still'd Thy senses like the birth of light, When thou hast trimmed thy lamp at night Or washed thy garments in the stream; To whose white bed had come the dream That He was thine and thou wast His Who feeds among the field-lilies. O solemn shadow of the end In that wise spirit long contain'd! O awful end! and those unsaid Long years when It was Finishèd! Mind'st thou not (when the twilight gone Left darkness in the house of John,) Between the naked window-bars That spacious vigil of the stars?— For thou, a watcher even as they, Wouldst rise from where throughout the day Thou wroughtest raiment for His poor; And, finding the fixed terms endure Of day and night which never brought Sounds of His coming chariot, Wouldst lift through cloud-waste unexplor'd Those eyes which said, “How long, O Lord?” Then that disciple whom He loved, Well heeding, haply would be moved To ask thy blessing in His name; And that one thought in both, the same Though silent, then would clasp ye round To weep together,—tears long bound, Sick tears of patience, dumb and slow. Yet, “Surely I come quickly,”—so He said, from life and death gone home. Amen: even so, Lord Jesus, come! But oh! what human tongue can speak That day when Michael came A Church legend of the Blessed Virgin's death. to break From the tir'd spirit, like a veil, Its covenant with Gabriel Endured at length unto the end? What human thought can apprehend That mystery of motherhood When thy Beloved at length renew'd The sweet communion severèd,— His left hand underneath thine head And His right hand embracing thee?— Lo! He was thine, and this is He! Soul, is it Faith, or Love, or Hope, That lets me see her standing up Where the light of the Throne is bright? Unto the left, unto the right, The cherubim, succinct, conjoint, Float inward to a golden point, And from between the seraphim The glory issues for a hymn. O Mary Mother, be not loth To listen,—thou whom the stars clothe, Who seëst and mayst not be seen! Hear us at last, O Mary Queen! Into our shadow bend thy face, Bowing thee from the secret place, O Mary Virgin, full of grace! THE PORTRAIT This is her picture as she was: It seems a thing to wonder on, As though mine image in the glass Should tarry when myself am gone. I gaze until she seems to stir,— Until mine eyes almost aver That now, even now, the sweet lips part To breathe the words of the sweet heart:— And yet the earth is over her. Alas! even such the thin-drawn ray That makes the prison-depths more rude,— The drip of water night and day Giving a tongue to solitude. Yet only this, of love's whole prize, Remains; save what in mournful guise Takes counsel with my soul alone,— Save what is secret and unknown, Below the earth, above the skies. In painting her I shrined her face 'Mid mystic trees, where light falls in Hardly at all; a covert place Where you might think to find a din Of doubtful talk, and a live flame Wandering, and many a shape whose name Not itself knoweth, and old dew, And your own footsteps meeting you, And all things going as they came. A deep dim wood; and there she stands As in that wood that day: for so Was the still movement of her hands And such the pure line's gracious flow. And passing fair the type must seem, Unknown the presence and the dream. 'Tis she: though of herself, alas! Less than her shadow on the grass Or than her image in the stream. That day we met there, I and she One with the other all alone; And we were blithe; yet memory Saddens those hours, as when the moon Looks upon daylight. And with her I stopped to drink the spring-water, Athirst where other waters sprang: And where the echo is, she sang,— My soul another echo there. But when that hour my soul won strength For words whose silence wastes and kills, Dull raindrops smote us, and at length Thundered the heat within the hills. That eve I spoke those words again Beside the pelted window-pane; And there she hearkened what I said, With under-glances that surveyed The empty pastures blind with rain. Next day the memories of these things, Like leaves through which a bird has flown, Still vibrated with Love's warm wings; Till I must make them all my own And paint this picture. So, 'twixt ease Of talk and sweet long silences, She stood among the plants in bloom At windows of a summer room, To feign the shadow of the trees. And as I wrought, while all above And all around was fragrant air, In the sick burthen of my love It seemed each sun-thrilled blossom there Beat like a heart among the leaves. O heart that never beats nor heaves, In that one darkness lying still, What now to thee my love's great will Or the fine web the sunshine weaves? For now doth daylight disavow Those days—nought left to see or hear. Only in solemn whispers now At night-time these things reach mine ear; When the leaf-shadows at a breath Shrink in the road, and all the heath, Forest and water, far and wide, In limpid starlight glorified, Lie like the mystery of death. Last night at last I could have slept, And yet delayed my sleep till dawn, Still wandering. Then it was I wept: For unawares I came upon Those glades where once she walked with me: And as I stood there suddenly, All wan with traversing the night, Upon the desolate verge of light Yearned loud the iron-bosomed sea. Even so, where Heaven holds breath and hears The beating heart of Love's own breast,— Where round the secret of all spheres All angels lay their wings to rest,— How shall my soul stand rapt and awed, When, by the new birth borne abroad Throughout the music of the suns, It enters in her soul at once And knows the silence there for God! Here with her face doth memory sit Meanwhile, and wait the day's decline, Till other eyes shall look from it, Eyes of the spirit's Palestine, Even than the old gaze tenderer: While hopes and aims long lost with her Stand round her image side by side, Like tombs of pilgrims that have died About the Holy Sepulchre. FOR OUR LADY OF THE ROCKS BY LEONARDO DA VINCI Mother, is this the darkness of the end, The Shadow of Death? and is that outer sea Infinite imminent Eternity? And does the death-pang by man's seed sustained In Time's each instant cause thy face to bend Its silent prayer upon the Son, while He Blesses the dead with His hand silently To His long day which hours no more offend? Mother of grace, the pass is difficult, Keen as these rocks, and the bewildered souls Throng it like echoes, blindly shuddering through. Thy name, O Lord, each spirit's voice extols, Whose peace abides in the dark avenue Amid the bitterness of things occult. AT THE SUN-RISE IN 1848 God said, Let there be light; and there was light. Then heard we sounds as though the Earth did sing And the Earth's angel cried upon the wing: We saw priests fall together and turn white: And covered in the dust from the sun's sight, A king was spied, and yet another king. We said: “The round world keeps its balancing; On this globe, they and we are opposite,— If it is day with us, with them 'tis night.” Still, Man, in thy just pride, remember this:— Thou hadst not made that thy sons' sons shall ask What the word king may mean in their day's task, But for the light that led: and if light is, It is because God said, Let there be light. AUTUMN SONG Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf How the heart feels a languid grief Laid on it for a covering, And how sleep seems a goodly thing In Autumn at the fall of the leaf? And how the swift beat of the brain Falters because it is in vain, In Autumn at the fall of the leaf Knowest thou not? and how the chief Of joys seems—not to suffer pain? Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf How the soul feels like a dried sheaf Bound up at length for harvesting, And how death seems a comely thing In Autumn at the fall of the leaf? THE LADY'S LAMENT Never happy any more! Aye, turn the saying o'er and o'er, It says but what it said before, And heart and life are just as sore. The wet leaves blow aslant the floor In the rain through the open door. No, no more. Never happy any more! The eyes are weary and give o'er, But still the soul weeps as before. And always must each one deplore Each once, nor bear what others bore? This is now as it was of yore. No, no more. Never happy any more! Is it not but a sorry lore That says, “Take strength, the worst is o'er”? Shall the stars seem as heretofore? The day wears on more and more— While I was weeping the day wore. No, no more. Never happy any more! In the cold behind the door That was the dial striking four: One for joy the past hours bore, Two for hope and will cast o'er, One for the naked dark before. No, no more. Never happy any more! Put the light out, shut the door, Sweep the wet leaves from the floor. Even thus Fate's hand has swept her floor, Even thus Love's hand has shut the door Through which his warm feet passed of yore. Shall it be opened any more? No, no, no more. MARY'S GIRLHOOD (For a Picture) I This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect God's Virgin. Gone is a great while, and she Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee. Unto God's will she brought devout respect, Profound simplicity of intellect, And supreme patience. From her mother's knee Faithful and hopeful; wise in charity; Strong in grave peace; in pity circumspect. So held she through her girlhood; as it were An angel-watered lily, that near God Grows and is quiet. Till, one dawn at home She woke in her white bed, and had no fear At all,—yet wept till sunshine, and felt awed: Because the fulness of the time was come. II These are the symbols. On that cloth of red I' the centre is the Tripoint: perfect each, Except the second of its points, to teach That Christ is not yet born. The books—whose head Is golden Charity, as Paul hath said— Those virtues are wherein the soul is rich: Therefore on them the lily standeth, which Is Innocence, being interpreted. The seven-thorn'd briar and the palm seven-leaved Are her great sorrow and her great reward. Until the end be full, the Holy One Abides without. She soon shall have achieved Her perfect purity: yea, God the Lord Shall soon vouchsafe His Son to be her Son. THE CARD-DEALER Could you not drink her gaze like wine? Yet though its splendour swoon Into the silence languidly As a tune into a tune, Those eyes unravel the coiled night And know the stars at noon. The gold that's heaped beside her hand, In truth rich prize it were; And rich the dreams that wreathe her brows With magic stillness there; And he were rich who should unwind That woven golden hair. Around her, where she sits, the dance Now breathes its eager heat; And not more lightly or more true Fall there the dancers' feet Than fall her cards on the bright board As 'twere a heart that beat. Her fingers let them softly through, Smooth polished silent things; And each one as it falls reflects In swift light-shadowings, Blood-red and purple, green and blue, The great eyes of her rings. Whom plays she with? With thee, who lov'st Those gems upon her hand; With me, who search her secret brows; With all men, bless'd or bann'd. We play together, she and we, Within a vain strange land: A land without any order,— Day even as night, (one saith,)— Where who lieth down ariseth not Nor the sleeper awakeneth; A land of darkness as darkness itself And of the shadow of death. What be her cards, you ask? Even these:— The heart, that doth but crave More, having fed; the diamond, Skilled to make base seem brave; The club, for smiting in the dark; The spade, to dig a grave. And do you ask what game she plays? With me 'tis lost or won; With thee it is playing still; with him It is not well begun; But 'tis a game she plays with all Beneath the sway o'the sun. Thou seest the card that falls,—she knows The card that followeth: Her game in thy tongue is called Life, As ebbs thy daily breath: When she shall speak, thou'lt learn her tongue And know she calls it Death. VOX ECCLESIÆ, VOX CHRISTI I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held; and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? —Rev. vi. 9, 10. Not 'neath the altar only,—yet, in sooth, There more than elsewhere,—is the cry, “How long?” The right sown there hath still borne fruit in wrong— The wrong waxed fourfold. Thence, (in hate of truth) O'er weapons blessed for carnage, to fierce youth From evil age, the word hath hissed along:— “Ye are the Lord's: go forth, destroy, be strong: Christ's Church absolves ye from Christ's law of ruth.” Therefore the wine-cup at the altar is As Christ's own blood indeed, and as the blood Of Christ's elect, at divers seasons spilt On the altar-stone, that to man's church, for this, Shall prove a stone of stumbling,—whence it stood To be rent up ere the true Church be built. ON REFUSAL OF AID BETWEEN NATIONS Not that the earth is changing, O my God! Nor that the seasons totter in their walk,— Not that the virulent ill of act and talk Seethes ever as a winepress ever trod,— Not therefore are we certain that the rod Weighs in thine hand to smite thy world; though now Beneath thine hand so many nations bow, So many kings:—not therefore, O my God!— But because Man is parcelled out in men To-day; because, for any wrongful blow No man not stricken asks, “I would be told Why thou dost thus;” but his heart whispers then, “He is he, I am I.” By this we know That our earth falls asunder, being old. SHAKESPEAR Probably there is no character in which is so much of Shakespear himself as in Hamlet except in Falstaff. Dear friend, if there be any bond Which friendship wins not much beyond— So old and fond, since thought began— It may be that whose subtle span Binds Shakespear to an English man. BLAKE To the memory of William Blake, a Painter and Poet, whose greatness may be named even here since it was equalled by his goodness, this tablet is now erected,—years after his death, at the age of sixty-eight, on August 12th, 1827, in poverty and neglect, by one who honours his life and works. Epitaph All beauty to pourtray, Therein his duty lay, And still through toilsome strife Duty to him was life— Most thankful still that duty Lay in the paths of beauty. A TRIP TO PARIS AND BELGIUM I LONDON TO FOLKESTONE (Half-past one to half-past five) A constant keeping-past of shaken trees, And a bewildered glitter of loose road; Banks of bright growth, with single blades atop Against white sky; and wires—a constant chain— That seem to draw the clouds along with them (Things which one stoops against the light to see Through the low window; shaking by at rest, Or fierce like water as the swiftness grows); And, seen through fences or a bridge far off, Trees that in moving keep their intervals Still one 'twixt bar and bar; and then at times Long reaches of green level, where one cow, Feeding among her fellows that feed on, Lifts her slow neck, and gazes for the sound. There are six of us: I that write away; Hunt reads Dumas, hard-lipped, with heavy jowl And brows hung low, and the long ends of hair Standing out limp. A grazier at one end (Thank luck not my end!) has blocked out the air, And sits in heavy consciousness of guilt. The poor young muff who's face to face with me Is pitiful in loose collar and black tie, His latchet-button shaking as we go. There are flowers by me, half upon my knees, Owned by a dame who's fair in soul, no doubt: The wind that beats among us carries off Their scent, but still I have them for my eye. Fields mown in ridges; and close garden-crops Of the earth's increase; and a constant sky Still with clear trees that let you see the wind; And snatches of the engine-smoke, by fits Tossed to the wind against the landscape, where Rooks stooping heave their wings upon the day. Brick walls we pass between, passed so at once That for the suddenness I cannot know Or what, or where begun, or where at end. Sometimes a Station in grey quiet; whence, With a short gathered champing of pent sound, We are let out upon the air again. Now nearly darkness; knees and arms and sides Feel the least touch, and close about the face A wind of noise that is along like God. Pauses of water soon, at intervals, That has the sky in it;—the reflexes O' the trees move towards the bank as we go by, Leaving the water's surface plain. I now Lie back and close my eyes a space; for they Smart from the open forwardness of thought Fronting the wind— —I did not scribble more, Be certain, after this; but yawned, and read, And nearly dozed a little, I believe; Till, stretching up against the carriage-back, I was roused altogether, and looked out To where, upon the desolate verge of light, Yearned, pale and vast, the iron-coloured sea. II BOULOGNE TO AMIENS AND PARIS (3 to 11 P.M.; 3rd class) Strong extreme speed, that the brain hurries with, Further than trees, and hedges, and green grass Whitened by distance,—further than small pools Held among fields and gardens,—further than Haystacks and windmill-sails and roofs and herds,— The sea's last margin ceases at the sun. The sea has left us, but the sun remains. Sometimes the country spreads aloof in tracts Smooth from the harvest; sometimes sky and land Are shut from the square space the window leaves By a dense crowd of trees, stem behind stem Passing across each other as we pass: Sometimes tall poplar-wands stand white, their heads Outmeasuring the distant hills. Sometimes The ground has a deep greenness; sometimes brown In stubble; and sometimes no ground at all, For the close strength of crops that stand unreaped. The water-plots are sometimes all the sun's,— Sometimes quite green through shadows filling them, Or islanded with growths of reeds,—or else Masked in grey dust like the wide face o'the fields. And still the swiftness lasts; that to our speed The trees seem shaken like a press of spears. There is some count of us:—folks travelling-capped, Priesthood, and lank hard-featured soldiery, Females (no women), blouses, Hunt, and I. We are relayed at Amiens. The steam Snorts, chafes, and bridles, like three-hundred horse, And flings its dusky mane upon the air. Our company is thinned, and lamps alight: But still there are the folks in travelling-caps— No priesthood now, but always soldiery, And babies to make up for show in noise, Females (no women), blouses, Hunt, and I. Our windows at one side are shut for warmth; Upon the other side, a leaden sky, Hung in blank glare, makes all the country dim, Which too seems bald and meagre,—be it truth, Or of the waxing darkness. Here and there The shade takes light, where in thin patches stand The unstirred dregs of water. Hunt can see A moon, he says; but I am too far back. Still the same speed and thunder. We are stopped Again, and speech tells clearer than in day. Hunt has just stretched to tell me that he fears I and my note-book may be taken for The stuff that goes to make an “émissaire De la perfide.” Let me abate my zeal: There is a stout gendarme within the coach. This cursed pitching is too bad. My teeth Jingle together in it; and my legs (Which I got wet at Boulogne this good day Wading for star-fish) are so chilled that I Would don my coat, were not these seats too hard To spare it from beneath me, and were not The love of ease less than the love of sloth. Hunt has just told me it is nearly eight: We do not reach till half-past ten. Drat verse, And steam, and Paris, and the fins of Time! Marry, for me, look you, I will go sleep. Most of them slept; I could not—held awake By jolting clamour, with shut eyes; my head Willing to nod and fancy itself vague. Only at Stations I looked round me, when Short silence paused among us, and I felt A creeping in my feet from abrupt calm. At such times Hunt would jerk himself, and then Tumble uncouthly forward in his sleep. This lasted near three hours. The darkness now Stayeth behind us on the sullen road, And all this light is Paris. Dieu merci.Paris. Saturday Night, 29. Send me, dear William, by return of post, As much as you can manage of that rhyme Incurred at Ventnor. Bothers and delays Have still prevented me from copying this Till now; now that I do so, let it be Anticipative compensation. Numéro 4 Rue Geoffroy Marie, Faubourg Montmartre, près des Boulevards. Dear William, labelled thus the thing will reach. III THE STAIRCASE OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS As one who, groping in a narrow stair, Hath a strong sound of bells upon his ears, Which, being at a distance off, appears Quite close to him because of the pent air: So with this France. She stumbles file and square Darkling and without space for breath: each one Who hears the thunder says: “It shall anon Be in among her ranks to scatter her.” This may be; and it may be that the storm Is spent in rain upon the unscathed seas, Or wasteth other countries ere it die: Till she,—having climbed always through the swarm Of darkness and of hurtling sound,—from these Shall step forth on the light in a still sky. IV PLACE DE LA BASTILLE, PARIS How dear the sky has been above this place! Small treasures of this sky that we see here Seen weak through prison-bars from year to year; Eyed with a painful prayer upon God's grace To save, and tears which stayed along the face Lifted at sunset. Yea, how passing dear Those nights when through the bars a wind left clear The heaven, and moonlight soothed the limpid space! So was it, till one night the secret kept Safe in low vault and stealthy corridor Was blown abroad on gospel-tongues of flame. O ways of God, mysterious evermore! How many on this spot have cursed and wept That all might stand here now and own Thy Name. V ON A HANDFUL OF FRENCH MONEY These coins that jostle on my hand do own No single image: each name here and date Denoting in man's consciousness and state New change. In some, the face is clearly known,— In others marred. The badge of that old throne Of Kings is on the obverse; or this sign Which says, “I France am all—lo, I am mine!” Or else the Eagle that dared soar alone. Even as these coins, so are these lives and years Mixed and bewildered; yet hath each of them No less its part in what is come to be For France. Empire, Republic, Monarchy,— Each clamours or keeps silence in her name, And lives within the pulse that now is hers. VI TO THE P. R. B. Woolner and Stephens, Collinson, Millais, And my first brother, each and every one, What portion is theirs now beneath the sun Which, even as here, in England makes to-day? For most of them life runs not the same way Always, but leaves the thought at loss: I know Merely that Woolner keeps not even the show Of work, nor is enough awake for play. Meanwhile Hunt and myself race at full speed Along the Louvre, and yawn from school to school, Wishing worn-out those masters known as old. And no man asks of Browning; though indeed (As the book travels with me) any fool Who would might hear Sordello's story told. VII IN THE TRAIN, AND AT VERSAILLES In a dull swiftness we are carried by With bodies left at sway and shaking knees. The wind has ceased, or is a feeble breeze Warm in the sun. The leaves are not yet dry From yesterday's dense rain. All, low and high, A strong green country; but, among its trees, Ruddy and thin with Autumn. After these There is the city still before the sky. Versailles is reached. Pass we the galleries And seek the gardens. A great silence here, Through the long planted alleys, to the long Distance of water. More than tune or song, Silence shall grow to awe within thine eyes, Till thy thought swim with the blue turning sphere. VIII LAST VISIT TO THE LOUVRE The Cry of the P. R. B., after a careful Examination of the Canvases of Rubens, Correggio, et hoc genus omne. Non noi pittori! God of Nature's truth, If these, not we! Be it not said, when one Of us goes hence: “As these did, he hath done; His feet sought out their footprints from his youth.” Because, dear God! the flesh Thou madest smooth These carked and fretted, that it seemed to run With ulcers; and the daylight of thy sun They parcelled into blots and glares, uncouth With stagnant grouts of paint. Men say that these Had further sight than man's, but that God saw Their works were good. God that didst know them foul! In such a blindness, blinder than the owl, Leave us! Our sight can reach unto thy seas And hills: and 'tis enough for tears of awe. IX LAST SONNETS AT PARIS I Chins that might serve the new Jerusalem; Streets footsore; minute whisking milliners, Dubbed graceful, but at whom one's eye demurs, Knowing of England; ladies, much the same; Bland smiling dogs with manes—a few of them At pains to look like sporting characters; Vast humming tabbies smothered in their furs; Groseille, orgeat, meringues à la crême— Good things to study; ditto bad—the maps Of sloshy colour in the Louvre; cinq-francs The largest coin; and at the restaurants Large Ibrahim Pachas in Turkish caps To pocket them. Un million d' habitants: Cast up, they'll make an Englishman—perhaps. II Tiled floors in bedrooms; trees (now run to seed— Such seed as the wind takes) of Liberty; Squares with new names that no one seems to see; Scrambling Briarean passages, which lead To the first place you came from; urgent need Of unperturbed nasal philosophy; Through Paris (what with church and gallery) Some forty first-rate paintings,—or indeed Fifty mayhap; fine churches; splendid inns; Fierce sentinels (toy-size without the stands) Who spit their oaths at you and grind their r's If at a fountain you would wash your hands; One Frenchman (this is fact) who thinks he spars:— Can even good dinners cover all these sins? III Yet in the mighty French metropolis Our time has not gone from us utterly In waste. The wise man saith, “An ample fee For toil, to work thine end.” Aye that it is. Should England ask, “Was narrow prejudice Stretched to its utmost point unflinchingly, Even unto lying, at all times, by ye?” We can say firmly: “Lord, thou knowest this, Our soil may own us.” Having but small French, Hunt passed for a stern Spartan all the while, Uncompromising, of few words: for me— I think I was accounted generally A fool, and just a little cracked. Thy smile May light on us, Britannia, healthy wench. X FROM PARIS TO BRUSSELS (11 P.M. 15 October to half-past 1 P.M. 16) Proem at the Paris Station In France (to baffle thieves and murderers) A journey takes two days of passport work At least. The plan's sometimes a tedious one, But bears its fruit. Because, the other day, In passing by the Morgue, we saw a man (The thing is common, and we never should Have known of it, only we passed that way) Who had been stabbed and tumbled in the Seine, Where he had stayed some days. The face was black, And, like a negro's, swollen; all the flesh Had furred, and broken into a green mould. Now, very likely, he who did the job Was standing among those who stood with us, To look upon the corpse. You fancy him— Smoking an early pipe, and watching, as An artist, the effect of his last work. This always if it had not struck him that 'Twere best to leave while yet the body took Its crust of rot beneath the Seine. It may: But, if it did not, he can now remain Without much fear. Only, if he should want To travel, and have not his passport yet, (Deep dogs these French police!) he may be caught. Therefore you see (lest, being murderers, We should not have the sense to go before The thing were known, or to stay afterwards) There is good reason why—having resolved To start for Belgium—we were kept three days To learn about the passports first, then do As we had learned. This notwithstanding, in The fullness of the time 'tis come to pass. XI ON THE ROAD October, and eleven after dark: Both mist and night. Among us in the coach Packed heat on which the windows have been shut: Our backs unto the motion—Hunt's and mine. The last lamps of the Paris Station move Slow with wide haloes past the clouded pane; The road in secret empty darkness. One Who sits beside me, now I turn, has pulled A nightcap to his eyes. A woman here, Knees to my knees—a twenty-nine-year-old— Smiles at the mouth I open, seeing him: I look her gravely in the jaws, and write. Already while I write heads have been leaned Upon the wall,—the lamp that's overhead Dropping its shadow to the waist and hands. Some time 'twixt sleep and wake. A dead pause then, With giddy humming silence in the ears. It is a Station. Eyes are opening now, And mouths collecting their propriety. From one of our two windows, now drawn up, A lady leans, hawks a clear throat, and spits. Hunt lifts his head from my cramped shoulder where It has been lying—long stray hairs from it Crawling upon my face and teazing me. Ten minutes' law. Our feet are in the road. A weak thin dimness at the sky, whose chill Lies vague and hard. The mist of crimson heat Hangs, a spread glare, about our engine's bulk. I shall get in again, and sleep this time. A heavy clamour that fills up the brain Like thought grown burdensome; and in the ears Speed that seems striving to o'ertake itself; And in the pulses torpid life, which shakes As water to a stir of wind beneath. Poor Hunt, who has the toothache and can't smoke, Has asked me twice for brandy. I would sleep; But man proposes, and no more. I sit With open eyes, and a head quite awake, But which keeps catching itself lolled aside And looking sentimental. In the coach, If any one tries talking, the voice jolts, And stuns the ear that stoops for it. Amiens. Half-an-hour's rest. Another shivering walk Along the station, waiting for the bell. Ding-dong. Now this time, by the Lord, I'll sleep. I must have slept some while. Now that I wake, Day is beginning in a kind of haze White with grey trees. The hours have had their lapse. A sky too dull for cloud. A country lain In fields, where teams drag up the furrow yet; Or else a level of trees, the furthest ones Seen like faint clouds at the horizon's point. Quite a clear distance, though in vapour. Mills That turn with the dry wind. Large stacks of hay Made to look bleak. Dead autumn, and no sun. The smoke upon our course is borne so near Along the earth, the earth appears to steam. Blanc-Misseron, the last French station, passed. We are in Belgium. It is just the same:— Nothing to write of, and no good in verse. Curse the big mounds of sand-weed! curse the miles Of barren chill,—the twentyfold relays! Curse every beastly Station on the road! As well to write as swear. Hunt was just now Making great eyes because outside the pane One of the stokers passed whom he declared A stunner. A vile mummy with a bag Is squatted next me: a disgusting girl Broad opposite. We have a poet, though, Who is a gentleman, and looks like one; Only he seems ashamed of writing verse, And heads each new page with “Mon cher Ami.” Hunt's stunner has just come into the coach, And set us hard agrin from ear to ear. Another Station. There's a stupid horn Set wheezing. Now I should just like to know —Just merely for the whim—what good that is. These Stations for the most part are a kind Of London coal-merchant's back premises; Whitewashed, but as by hands of coal-heavers; Grimy themselves, and always circled in With foul coke-loads that make the nose aroint. Here is a Belgian village,—no, a town Moated and buttressed. Next, a water-track Lying with draggled reeds in a flat slime. Next, the old country, always all the same. Now by Hans Hemmling and by John Van Eyck, You'll find, till something's new, I write no more. (4 Hours) There is small change of country; but the sun Is out, and it seems shame this were not said: For upon all the grass the warmth has caught; And betwixt distant whitened poplar-stems Makes greener darkness; and in dells of trees Shows spaces of a verdure that was hid; And the sky has its blue floated with white, And crossed with falls of the sun's glory aslant To lay upon the waters of the world; And from the road men stand with shaded eyes To look; and flowers in gardens have grown strong, And our own shadows here within the coach Are brighter; and all colour has more bloom. So, after the sore torments of the route:— Toothache, and headache, and the ache of wind, And huddled sleep, and smarting wakefulness, And night, and day, and hunger sick at food, And twentyfold relays, and packages To be unlocked, and passports to be found, And heavy well-kept landscape;—we were glad Because we entered Brussels in the sun. XII ON THE ROAD TO WATERLOO: 17 October (En vigilante, 2 hours) It is grey tingling azure overhead With silver drift. Beneath, where from the green The trees are reared, the distance stands between At peace: and on this side the whole is spread For sowing and for harvest, subjected Clear to the sky and wind. The sun's slow height Holds it through noon, and at the furthest night It lies to the moist starshine and is fed. Sometimes there is no country seen (for miles You think) because of the near roadside path Dense with long forest. Where the waters run They have the sky sunk into them—a bath Of still blue heat; and in their flow, at whiles, There is a blinding vortex of the sun. XIII A HALF-WAY PAUSE The turn of noontide has begun. In the weak breeze the sunshine yields. There is a bell upon the fields. On the long hedgerow's tangled run A low white cottage intervenes: Against the wall a blind man leans, And sways his face to have the sun. Our horses' hoofs stir in the road, Quiet and sharp. Light hath a song Whose silence, being heard, seems long. The point of noon maketh abode, And will not be at once gone through. The sky's deep colour saddens you, And the heat weighs a dreamy load. XIV ON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO So then, the name which travels side by side With English life from childhood—Waterloo— Means this. The sun is setting. “Their strife grew Till the sunset, and ended,” says our guide. It lacked the “chord” by stage-use sanctified, Yet I believe one should have thrilled. For me, I grinned not, and 'twas something;—certainly These held their point, and did not turn but died: So much is very well. “Under each span Of these ploughed fields” ('tis the guide still) “there rot Three nations' slain, a thousand-thousandfold.” Am I to weep? Good sirs, the earth is old: Of the whole earth there is no single spot But hath among its dust the dust of man. RETURNING TO BRUSSELS Upon a Flemish road, when noon was deep, I passed a little consecrated shrine, Where, among simple pictures ranged in line, The blessed Mary holds her child asleep. To kneel here, shepherd-maidens leave their sheep When they feel grave because of the sunshine, And again kneel here in the day's decline; And here, when their life ails them, come to weep. Night being full, I passed on the same road By the same shrine; within, a lamp was lit Which through the silence of clear darkness glowed. Thus, when life's heat is past and doubts arise Darkling, the lamp of Faith must strengthen it, Which sometimes will not light and sometimes dies. XVI ANTWERP TO GHENT We are upon the Scheldt. We know we move Because there is a floating at our eyes Whatso they seek; and because all the things Which on our outset were distinct and large Are smaller and much weaker and quite grey, And at last gone from us. No motion else. We are upon the road. The thin swift moon Runs with the running clouds that are the sky, And with the running water runs—at whiles Weak 'neath the film and heavy growth of reeds. The country swims with motion. Time itself Is consciously beside us, and perceived. Our speed is such the sparks our engine leaves Are burning after the whole train has passed. The darkness is a tumult. We tear on, The roll behind us and the cry before, Constantly, in a lull of intense speed And thunder. Any other sound is known Merely by sight. The shrubs, the trees your eye Scans for their growth, are far along in haze. The sky has lost its clouds, and lies away Oppressively at calm: the moon has failed: Our speed has set the wind against us. Now Our engine's heat is fiercer, and flings up Great glares alongside. Wind and steam and speed And clamour and the night. We are in Ghent. XVII ANTWERP AND BRUGES I climbed the stair in Antwerp church, What time the circling thews of sound At sunset seem to heave it round. Far up, the carillon did search The wind, and the birds came to perch Far under, where the gables wound. In Antwerp harbour on the Scheldt I stood along, a certain space Of night. The mist was near my face; Deep on, the flow was heard and felt. The carillon kept pause, and dwelt In music through the silent place. John Memmeling and John van Eyck Hold state at Bruges. In sore shame I scanned the works that keep their name. The carillon, which then did strike Mine ears, was heard of theirs alike: It set me closer unto them. I climbed at Bruges all the flight The belfry has of ancient stone. For leagues I saw the east wind blown; The earth was grey, the sky was white. I stood so near upon the height That my flesh felt the carillon. XVIII ON LEAVING BRUGES The city's steeple-towers remove away, Each singly; as each vain infatuate Faith Leaves God in heaven, and passes. A mere breath Each soon appears, so far. Yet that which lay The first is now scarce further or more grey Than the last is. Now all are wholly gone. The sunless sky has not once had the sun Since the first weak beginning of the day. The air falls back as the wind finishes, And the clouds stagnate. On the water's face The current breathes along, but is not stirred. There is no branch that thrills with any bird. Winter is to possess the earth a space, And have its will upon the extreme seas. XIX ASHORE AT DOVER On landing, the first voice one hears is from An English police-constable; a man Respectful, conscious that at need he can Enforce respect. Our custom-house at home Strict too, but quiet. Not the foul-mouthed scum Of passport-mongers who in Paris still Preserve the Reign of Terror; not the till Where the King haggles, all through Belgium. The country somehow seems in earnest here, Grave and sufficient:—England, so to speak; No other word will make the thing as clear. “Ah! habit,” you exclaim, “and prejudice!” If so, so be it. One don't care to shriek, “Sir, this shall be!” But one believes it is. FOR A VENETIAN PASTORAL BY GIORGIONE (In the Louvre) Water, for anguish of the solstice:—nay, But dip the vessel slowly,—nay, but lean And hark how at its verge the wave sighs in Reluctant. Hush! beyond all depth away The heat lies silent at the brink of day: Now the hand trails upon the viol-string That sobs, and the brown faces cease to sing, Sad with the whole of pleasure. Whither stray Her eyes now, from whose mouth the slim pipes creep And leave it pouting, while the shadowed grass Is cool against her naked side? Let be:— Say nothing now unto her lest she weep, Nor name this ever. Be it as it was,— Life touching lips with Immortality. FOR AN ALLEGORICAL DANCE OF WOMEN BY ANDREA MANTEGNA (In the Louvre) Scarcely, I think; yet it indeed may be The meaning reached him, when this music rang Clear through his frame, a sweet possessive pang, And he beheld these rocks and that ridged sea. But I believe that, leaning tow'rds them, he Just felt their hair carried across his face As each girl passed him; nor gave ear to trace How many feet; nor bent assuredly His eyes from the blind fixedness of thought To know the dancers. It is bitter glad Even unto tears. Its meaning filleth it, A secret of the wells of Life: to wit:— The heart's each pulse shall keep the sense it had With all, though the mind's labour run to nought. FOR “RUGGIERO AND ANGELICA” BY INGRES I A remote sky, prolonged to the sea's brim: One rock-point standing buffeted alone, Vexed at its base with a foul beast unknown, Hell-birth of geomaunt and teraphim: A knight, and a winged creature bearing him, Reared at the rock: a woman fettered there, Leaning into the hollow with loose hair And throat let back and heartsick trail of limb. The sky is harsh, and the sea shrewd and salt: Under his lord the griffin-horse ramps blind With rigid wings and tail. The spear's lithe stem Thrills in the roaring of those jaws: behind, That evil length of body chafes at fault. She does not hear nor see—she knows of them. II Clench thine eyes now,—'tis the last instant, girl: Draw in thy senses, set thy knees, and take One breath for all: thy life is keen awake,— Thou mayst not swoon. Was that the scattered whirl Of its foam drenched thee?—or the waves that curl And split, bleak spray wherein thy temples ache? Or was it his the champion's blood to flake Thy flesh?—or thine own blood's anointing, girl? Now, silence: for the sea's is such a sound As irks not silence; and except the sea, All now is still. Now the dead thing doth cease To writhe, and drifts. He turns to her: and she, Cast from the jaws of Death, remains there, bound, Again a woman in her nakedness. FOR A VIRGIN AND CHILD BY HANS MEMMELINCK (In the Academy of Bruges) Mystery: God, man's life, born into man Of woman. There abideth on her brow The ended pang of knowledge, the which now Is calm assured. Since first her task began She hath known all. What more of anguish than Endurance oft hath lived through, the whole space Through night till day, passed weak upon her face While the heard lapse of darkness slowly ran? All hath been told her touching her dear Son, And all shall be accomplished. Where He sits Even now, a babe, He holds the symbol fruit Perfect and chosen. Until God permits, His soul's elect still have the absolute Harsh nether darkness, and make painful moan. FOR A MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE BY THE SAME (In the Hospital of St. John at Bruges) Mystery: Catherine the bride of Christ. She kneels, and on her hand the holy Child Now sets the ring. Her life is hushed and mild, Laid in God's knowledge—ever unenticed From God, and in the end thus fitly priced. Awe, and the music that is near her, wrought Of angels, have possessed her eyes in thought: Her utter joy is hers, and hath sufficed. There is a pause while Mary Virgin turns The leaf, and reads. With eyes on the spread book, That damsel at her knees reads after her. John whom He loved, and John His harbinger, Listen and watch. Whereon soe'er thou look, The light is starred in gems and the gold burns. THE SEA-LIMITS Consider the sea's listless chime: Time's self it is, made audible,— The murmur of the earth's own shell. Secret continuance sublime Is the sea's end: our sight may pass No furlong further. Since time was, This sound hath told the lapse of time. No quiet, which is death's,—it hath The mournfulness of ancient life, Enduring always at dull strife. As the world's heart of rest and wrath, Its painful pulse is in the sands. Last utterly, the whole sky stands, Grey and not known, along its path. Listen alone beside the sea, Listen alone among the woods; Those voices of twin solitudes Shall have one sound alike to thee: Hark where the murmurs of thronged men Surge and sink back and surge again,— Still the one voice of wave and tree. Gather a shell from the strown beach And listen at its lips: they sigh The same desire and mystery, The echo of the whole sea's speech. And all mankind is thus at heart Not anything but what thou art: And Earth, Sea, Man, are all in each. WORLD'S WORTH 'Tis of the Father Hilary. He strove, but could not pray; so took The steep-coiled stair, where his feet shook A sad blind echo. Ever up He toiled. 'Twas a sick sway of air That autumn noon within the stair, As dizzy as a turning cup. His brain benumbed him, void and thin; He shut his eyes and felt it spin; The obscure deafness hemmed him in. He said: “O world, what world for me?” He leaned unto the balcony Where the chime keeps the night and day; It hurt his brain, he could not pray. He had his face upon the stone: Deep 'twixt the narrow shafts, his eye Passed all the roofs to the stark sky, Swept with no wing, with wind alone. Close to his feet the sky did shake With wind in pools that the rains make; The ripple set his eyes to ache. He said: “O world, what world for me?” He stood within the mystery Girding God's blessed Eucharist: The organ and the chaunt had ceas'd. The last words paused against his ear Said from the altar: drawn round him The gathering rest was dumb and dim. And now the sacring-bell rang clear And ceased; and all was awe,—the breath Of God in man that warranteth The inmost utmost things of faith. He said: “O God, my world in Thee!” SONG AND MUSIC O leave your hand where it lies cool Upon the eyes whose lids are hot: Its rosy shade is bountiful Of silence, and assuages thought. O lay your lips against your hand And let me feel your breath through it, While through the sense your song shall fit The soul to understand. The music lives upon my brain, Between your hands, within mine eyes; It stirs your lifted throat like pain, An aching pulse of melodies. Lean nearer, let the music pause: The soul may better understand Your music, shadowed in your hand, Now while the song withdraws. SACRAMENT HYMN On a fair Sabbath day, when His banquet is spread, It is pleasant to feast with my Lord: His stewards stand robed at the foot and the head Of the soul-filling, life-giving board. All the guests here had burthens; but by the King's grant We left them behind when we came; The burthen of wealth and the burthen of want, And even the burthen of shame. And oh, when we take them again at the gate, Though still we must bear them awhile, Much smaller they'll seem in the lane that grows strait, And much lighter to lift at the stile. For that which is in us is life to the heart, Is dew to the soles of the feet, Fresh strength to the loins, giving ease from their smart. Warmth in frost, and a breeze in the heat. No feast where the belly alone hath its fill,— He gives me His body and blood; The blood and the body (I'll think of it still) Of my Lord, which is Christ, which is God. DENNIS SHAND The shadows fall along the wall, It's night at Haye-la-Serre; The maidens weave since day grew eve, The lady's in her chair. O passing slow the long hours go With time to think and sigh, When weary maidens weave beneath A listless lady's eye. It's two days that Earl Simon's gone And it's the second night; At Haye-la-Serre the lady's fair, In June the moon is light. O it's “Maids, ye'll wake till I come back,” And the hound's i' the lady's chair: No shuttles fly, the work stands by, It's play at Haye-la-Serre. The night is worn, the lamp's forlorn, The shadows waste and fail; There's morning air at Haye-la-Serre, The watching maids look pale. O all unmarked the birds at dawn Where drowsy maidens be; But heard too soon the lark's first tune Beneath the trysting tree. “Hold me thy hand, sweet Dennis Shand,” Says the Lady Joan de Haye, “That thou to-morrow do forget To-day and yesterday. “For many a weary month to come My lord keeps house with me, And sighing summer must lie cold In winter's company. “And many an hour I'll pass thee by And see thee and be seen; Yet not a glance must tell by chance How sweet these hours have been. “We've all to fear; there's Maud the spy, There's Ann whose face I scor'd, There's Blanch tells Huot everything, And Huot loves my lord. “But O and it's my Dennis 'll know, When my eyes look weary dim, Who finds the gold for his girdle-fee And who keeps love for him.” The morrow's come and the morrow-night, It's feast at Haye-la-Serre, And Dennis Shand the cup must hand Beside Earl Simon's chair. And still when the high pouring's done And cup and flagon clink, Till his lady's lips have touched the brim Earl Simon will not drink. But it's, “Joan my wife,” Earl Simon says, “Your maids are white and wan.” And it's, “O,” she says, “they've watched the night With Maud's sick sister Ann.” But it's, “Lady Joan and Joan my bird, Yourself look white and wan.” And it's, “O, I've walked the night myself To pull the herbs for Ann: “And some of your knaves were at the hutch And some in the cellarage, But the only one that watched with us Was Dennis Shand your page. “Look on the boy, sweet honey lord, How drooped his eyelids be: The rosy colour's not yet back That paled in serving me.” O it's, “Wife, your maids are foolish jades, And you're a silly chuck, And the lazy knaves shall get their staves About their ears for luck: “But Dennis Shand may take the cup And pour the wine to his hand; Wife, thou shalt touch it with thy lips, And drink thou, Dennis Shand!” THE MIRROR She knew it not:—most perfect pain To learn: this too she knew not. Strife For me, calm hers, as from the first. 'Twas but another bubble burst Upon the curdling draught of life,— My silent patience mine again. As who, of forms that crowd unknown Within a distant mirror's shade, Deems such an one himself, and makes Some sign; but when the image shakes No whit, he finds his thought betray'd, And must seek elsewhere for his own. A YOUNG FIR-WOOD These little firs to-day are things To clasp into a giant's cap, Or fans to suit his lady's lap. From many winters many springs Shall cherish them in strength and sap Till they be marked upon the map, A wood for the wind's wanderings. All seed is in the sower's hands: And what at first was trained to spread Its shelter for some single head,— Yea, even such fellowship of wands,— May hide the sunset, and the shade Of its great multitude be laid Upon the earth and elder sands. DURING MUSIC O cool unto the sense of pain That last night's sleep could not destroy; O warm unto the sense of joy, That dreams its life within the brain. What though I lean o'er thee to scan The written music cramped and stiff;— 'Tis dark to me, as hieroglyph On those weird bulks Egyptian. But as from those, dumb now and strange, A glory wanders on the earth, Even so thy tones can call a birth From these, to shake my soul with change. O swift, as in melodious haste Float o'er the keys thy fingers small; O soft, as is the rise and fall Which stirs that shade within thy breast. ON THE VITA NUOVA OF DANTE As he that loves oft looks on the dear form And guesses how it grew to womanhood, And gladly would have watched the beauties bud And the mild fire of precious life wax warm: So I, long bound within the threefold charm Of Dante's love sublimed to heavenly mood, Had marvelled, touching his Beatitude, How grew such presence from man's shameful swarm. At length within this book I found pourtrayed Newborn that Paradisal Love of his, And simple like a child; with whose clear aid I understood. To such a child as this, Christ, charging well His chosen ones, forbade Offence: “for lo! of such my kingdom is.” WELLINGTON'S FUNERAL 18th November 1852 “Victory!” So once more the cry must be. Duteous mourning we fulfil In God's name; but by God's will, Doubt not, the last word is still “Victory!” Funeral, In the music round this pall, Solemn grief yields earth to earth; But what tones of solemn mirth In the pageant of new birth Rise and fall? For indeed, If our eyes were opened, Who shall say what escort floats Here, which breath nor gleam denotes,— Fiery horses, chariots Fire-footed? Trumpeter, Even thy call he may not hear; Long-known voice for ever past, Till with one more trumpet-blast God's assuring word at last Reach his ear. Multitude, Hold your breath in reverent mood: For while earth's whole kindred stand Mute even thus on either hand, This soul's labour shall be scann'd And found good. Cherubim, Lift ye not even now your hymn? Lo! once lent for human lack, Michael's sword is rendered back. Thrills not now the starry track, Seraphim? Gabriel, Since the gift of thine “All hail!” Out of Heaven no time hath brought Gift with fuller blessing fraught Than the peace which this man wrought Passing well. Be no word Raised of bloodshed Christ-abhorr'd. Say: “'Twas thus in His decrees Who Himself, the Prince of Peace, For His harvest's high increase Sent a sword.” Veterans, He by whom the neck of France Then was given unto your heel, Timely sought, may lend as well To your sons his terrible Countenance. Waterloo! As the last grave must renew, Ere fresh death, the banshee-strain,— So methinks upon thy plain Falls some presage in the rain, In the dew. And O thou, Watching, with an exile's brow Unappeased, o'er death's dumb flood:— Lo! the saving strength of God In some new heart's English blood Slumbers now. Emperor, Is this all thy work was for?— Thus to see thy self-sought aim, Yea thy titles, yea thy name, In another's shame, to shame Bandied o'er? Date of the Coup d'Etat: 2nd December 1851. Wellington, Thy great work is but begun. With quick seed his end is rife Whose long tale of conquering strife Shows no triumph like his life Lost and won. TO THOMAS WOOLNER First Snow, 9 February 1853 Woolner, to-night it snows for the first time. Our feet know well the path where in this snow Mine leave one track: how all the ways we know Are hoary in the long-unwonted rime! Grey as their ghosts which now in your new clime Must haunt you while those singing spirits reap All night the field of hospitable sleep— Whose song, past the whole sea, finds counter-chime. Can the year change, and I not think of thee, With whom so many changes of the year So many years were watched—our love's degree Alone the same? Ah still for thee and me, Winter or summer, Woolner, here or there, One grief, one joy, one loss, one victory. THE CHURCH-PORCHES I (TO M.F.R.) Sister, first shake we off the dust we have Upon our feet, lest it defile the stones Inscriptured, covering their sacred bones Who lie i'the aisles which keep the names they gave, Their trust abiding round them in the grave; Whom painters paint for visible orisons, And to whom sculptors pray in stone and bronze; Their voices echo still like a spent wave. Without here, the church-bells are but a tune, And on the carven church-door this hot noon Lays all its heavy sunshine here without: But having entered in, we shall find there Silence, and sudden dimness, and deep prayer, And faces of crowned angels all about. II (TO C.G.R.) Sister, arise: We have no more to sing Or say. The priest abideth as is meet To minister. Rise up out of thy seat, Though peradventure 'tis an irksome thing To cross again the threshold of our King Where His doors stand against the evil street, And let each step increase upon our feet The dust we shook from them at entering. Must we of very sooth go home? The air, Whose heat outside makes mist that can be seen, Is very clear and cool where we have been. The priest abideth ministering. Lo! As he for service, why not we for prayer? It is so bidden, sister, let us go. PENUMBRA I did not look upon her eyes, (Though scarcely seen, with no surprise, 'Mid many eyes a single look,) Because they should not gaze rebuke, At night, from stars in sky and brook. I did not take her by the hand, (Though little was to understand From touch of hand all friends might take,) Because it should not prove a flake Burnt in my palm to boil and ache. I did not listen to her voice, (Though none had noted, where at choice All might rejoice in listening,) Because no such a thing should cling In the wood's moan at evening. I did not cross her shadow once, (Though from the hollow west the sun's Last shadow runs along so far,) Because in June it should not bar My ways, at noon when fevers are. They told me she was sad that day, (Though wherefore tell what love's soothsay, Sooner than they, did register?) And my heart leapt and wept to her, And yet I did not speak nor stir. So shall the tongues of the sea's foam (Though many voices therewith come From drowned hope's home to cry to me,) Bewail one hour the more, when sea And wind are one with memory. THE HONEYSUCKLE I plucked a honeysuckle where The hedge on high is quick with thorn, And climbing for the prize, was torn, And fouled my feet in quag-water; And by the thorns and by the wind The blossom that I took was thinn'd, And yet I found it sweet and fair. Thence to a richer growth I came, Where, nursed in mellow intercourse, The honeysuckles sprang by scores, Not harried like my single stem, All virgin lamps of scent and dew. So from my hand that first I threw, Yet plucked not any more of them. WORDS ON THE WINDOW-PANE For a woman's fragmentary inscription. Did she in summer write it, or in spring, Or with this wail of autumn at her ears, Or in some winter left among old years Scratched it through tettered cark? A certain thing That round her heart the frost was hardening, Not to be thawed of tears, which on this pane Channelled the rime, perchance, in fevered rain, For false man's sake and love's most bitter sting. Howbeit, between this last word and the next Unwritten, subtly seasoned was the smart, And here at least the grace to weep: if she, Rather, midway in her disconsolate text, Rebelled not, loathing from the trodden heart That thing which she had found man's love to be. ON THE SITE OF A MULBERRY-TREE; Planted by Wm. Shakspeare; felled by the Rev. F. Gastrell This tree, here fall'n, no common birth or death Shared with its kind. The world's enfranchised son, Who found the trees of Life and Knowledge one, Here set it, frailer than his laurel-wreath. Shall not the wretch whose hand it fell beneath Rank also singly—the supreme unhung? Lo! Sheppard, Turpin, pleading with black tongue This viler thief's unsuffocated breath! We'll search thy glossary, Shakspeare! whence almost, And whence alone, some name shall be reveal'd For this deaf drudge, to whom no length of ears Sufficed to catch the music of the spheres; Whose soul is carrion now,—too mean to yield Some Starveling's ninth allotment of a ghost. A MATCH WITH THE MOON Weary already, weary miles to-night I walked for bed: and so, to get some ease, I dogged the flying moon with similes. And like a wisp she doubled on my sight In ponds; and caught in tree-tops like a kite; And in a globe of film all liquorish Swam full-faced like a silly silver fish;— Last like a bubble shot the welkin's height Where my road turned, and got behind me, and sent My wizened shadow craning round at me, And jeered, “So, step the measure,—one two three!” And if I faced on her, looked innocent. But just at parting, halfway down a dell, She kissed me for good-night. So you'll not tell. SUDDEN LIGHT I have been here before, But when or how I cannot tell: I know the grass beyond the door, The sweet, keen smell, The sighing sound, the lights around the shore. You have been mine before,— How long ago I may not know: But just when at that swallow's soar Your neck turned so, Some veil did fall,—I knew it all of yore. Has this been thus before? And shall not thus time's eddying flight Still with our lives our love restore In death's despite, And day and night yield one delight once more? STRATTON WATER “O have you seen the Stratton flood That's great with rain to-day? It runs beneath your wall, Lord Sands, Full of the new-mown hay. “I led your hounds to Hutton bank To bathe at early morn: They got their bath by Borrowbrake Above the standing corn.” Out from the castle-stair Lord Sands Looked up the western lea; The rook was grieving on her nest, The flood was round her tree. Over the castle-wall Lord Sands Looked down the eastern hill: The stakes swam free among the boats, The flood was rising still. “What's yonder far below that lies So white against the slope?” “O it's a sail o'your bonny barks The waters have washed up.” “But I have never a sail so white, And the water's not yet there.” “O it's the swans o'your bonny lake The rising flood doth scare.” “The swans they would not hold so still, So high they would not win.” “O it's Joyce my wife has spread her smock And fears to fetch it in.” “Nay, knave, it's neither sail nor swans, Nor aught that you can say; For though your wife might leave her smock, Herself she'd bring away.” Lord Sands has passed the turret-stair, The court, and yard, and all; The kine were in the byre that day, The nags were in the stall. Lord Sands has won the weltering slope Whereon the white shape lay: The clouds were still above the hill, And the shape was still as they. Oh pleasant is the gaze of life And sad is death's blind head; But awful are the living eyes In the face of one thought dead! “In God's name, Janet, is it me Thy ghost has come to seek?” “Nay, wait another hour, Lord Sands,— Be sure my ghost shall speak.” A moment stood he as a stone, Then grovelled to his knee. “O Janet, O my love, my love, Rise up and come with me!” “O once before you bade me come, And it's here you have brought me! “O many's the sweet word, Lord Sands, You've spoken oft to me; But all that I have from you to-day Is the rain on my body. “And many's the good gift, Lord Sands, You've promised oft to me; But the gift of yours I keep to-day Is the babe in my body. “O it's not in any earthly bed That first my babe I'll see; For I have brought my body here That the flood may cover me.” His face was close against her face, His hands of hers were fain: O her wet cheeks were hot with tears, Her wet hands cold with rain. “They told me you were dead, Janet,— How could I guess the lie?” “They told me you were false, Lord Sands,— What could I do but die?” “Now keep you well, my brother Giles,— Through you I deemed her dead! As wan as your towers seem to-day, To-morrow they'll be red. “Look down, look down, my false mother, That bade me not to grieve: You'll look up when our marriage fires Are lit to-morrow eve: “O more than one and more than two The sorrow of this shall see: But it's to-morrow, love, for them,— To-day's for thee and me.” He's drawn her face between his hands And her pale mouth to his: No bird that was so still that day Chirps sweeter than his kiss. The flood was creeping round their feet. “O Janet, come away! The hall is warm for the marriage-rite, The bed for the birthday.” “Nay, but I hear your mother cry, ‘Go bring this bride to bed! And would she christen her babe unborn, So wet she comes to wed?’ “I'll be your wife to cross your door And meet your mother's e'e. We plighted troth to wed i'the kirk, And it's there you'll wed with me.” He's ta'en her by the short girdle And by the dripping sleeve: “Go fetch Sir Jock my mother's priest,— You'll ask of him no leave. “O it's one half-hour to reach the kirk And one for the marriage-rite; And kirk and castle and castle-lands Shall be our babe's to-night.” “The flood's in the kirkyard, Lord Sands, And round the belfry-stair.” “I bade you fetch the priest,” he said, “Myself shall bring him there. “It's for the lilt of wedding bells We'll have the hail to pour, And for the clink of bridle-reins The plashing of the oar.” Beneath them on the nether hill A boat was floating wide: Lord Sands swam out and caught the oars And rowed to the hill-side. He's wrapped her in a green mantle And set her softly in; Her hair was wet upon her face, Her face was grey and thin; And “Oh!” she said, “lie still, my babe, It's out you must not win!” But woe's my heart for Father John As hard as he might pray, There seemed no help but Noah's ark Or Jonah's fish that day. The first strokes that the oars struck Were over the broad leas; The next strokes that the oars struck They pushed beneath the trees; The last stroke that the oars struck, The good boat's head was met, And there the gate of the kirk-yard Stood like a ferry-gate. He's set his hand upon the bar And lightly leaped within: He's lifted her to his left shoulder, Her knees beside his chin. The graves lay deep beneath the flood Under the rain alone; And when the foot-stone made him slip, He held by the head-stone. The empty boat thrawed i'the wind, Against the postern tied. “Hold still, you've brought my love with me, You shall take back my bride.” But woe's my heart for Father John And the saints he clamoured to! There's never a saint but Christopher Might hale such buttocks through! And “Oh!” she said, “on men's shoulders I well had thought to wend, And well to travel with a priest, But not to have cared or ken'd. “And oh!” she said, “it's well this way That I thought to have fared,— Not to have lighted at the kirk But stopped in the kirkyard. “For it's oh and oh I prayed to God, Whose rest I hoped to win, That when to-night at your board-head You'd bid the feast begin, This water past your window-sill Might bear my body in.” Now make the white bed warm and soft And greet the merry morn; The night the mother should have died, The young son shall be born. BEAUTY AND THE BIRD She fluted with her mouth as when one sips, And gently waved her golden head, inclin'd Outside his cage close to the window-blind; Till her fond bird, with little turns and dips, Piped low to her of sweet companionships. And when he made an end, some seed took she And fed him from her tongue, which rosily Peeped as a piercing bud between her lips. And like the child in Chaucer, on whose tongue The Blessed Mary laid, when he was dead, A grain,—who straightway praised her name in song: Even so, when she, a little lightly red, Now turned on me and laughed, I heard the throng Of inner voices praise her golden head. DAWN ON THE NIGHT-JOURNEY Till dawn the wind drove round me. It is past And still, and leaves the air to lisp of bird, And to the quiet that is almost heard Of the new-risen day, as yet bound fast In the first warmth of sunrise. When the last Of the sun's hours to-day shall be fulfilled, There shall another breath of time be stilled For me, which now is to my senses cast As much beyond me as eternity, Unknown, kept secret. On the newborn air The moth quivers in silence. It is vast, Yea, even beyond the hills upon the sea, The day whose end shall give this hour as sheer As chaos to the irrevocable Past. THE WOODSPURGE The wind flapped loose, the wind was still, Shaken out dead from tree and hill: I had walked on at the wind's will,— I sat now, for the wind was still. Between my knees my forehead was,— My lips, drawn in, said not Alas! My hair was over in the grass, My naked ears heard the day pass. My eyes, wide open, had the run Of some ten weeds to fix upon; Among those few, out of the sun, The woodspurge flowered, three cups in one. From perfect grief there need not be Wisdom or even memory: One thing then learnt remains to me,— The woodspurge has a cup of three. AFTER THE FRENCH LIBERATION OF ITALY As when the last of the paid joys of love Has come and gone; and with a single kiss At length, and with one laugh of satiate bliss, The wearied man a minute rests above The wearied woman, no more urged to move In those long throes of longing, till they glide, Now lightlier clasped, each to the other's side, In joys past acting, not past dreaming of:— So Europe now beneath this paramour Lies for a little out of use,—full oft Submissive to his lust, a loveless whore. He wakes, she sleeps, the breath falls slow and soft. Wait: the bought body holds a birth within, An harlot's child, to scourge her for her sin. EVEN SO So it is, my dear. All such things touch secret strings For heavy hearts to hear. So it is, my dear. Very like indeed: Sea and sky, afar, on high, Sand and strewn seaweed,— Very like indeed. But the sea stands spread As one wall with the flat skies, Where the lean black craft like flies Seem well-high stagnated, Soon to drop off dead. Seemed it so to us When I was thine and thou wast mine, And all these things were thus, But all our world in us? Could we be so now? Not if all beneath heaven's pall Lay dead but I and thou, Could we be so now! A LITTLE WHILE A little while a little love The hour yet bears for thee and me Who have not drawn the veil to see If still our heaven be lit above. Thou merely, at the day's last sigh, Hast felt thy soul prolong the tone; And I have heard the night-wind cry And deemed its speech mine own. A little while a little love The scattering autumn hoards for us Whose bower is not yet ruinous Nor quite unleaved our songless grove. Only across the shaken boughs We hear the flood-tides seek the sea, And deep in both our hearts they rouse One wail for thee and me. A little while a little love May yet be ours who have not said The word it makes our eyes afraid To know that each is thinking of. Not yet the end: be our lips dumb In smiles a little season yet: I'll tell thee, when the end is come, How we may best forget. A NEW-YEAR'S BURDEN Along the grass sweet airs are blown Our way this day in Spring. Of all the songs that we have known Now which one shall we sing? Not that, my love, ah no!— Not this, my love? why, so!— Yet both were ours, but hours will come and go. The grove is all a pale frail mist, The new year sucks the sun. Of all the kisses that we kissed Now which shall be the one? Not that my love, ah no!— Not this, my love?—heigh-ho For all the sweets that all the winds can blow! The branches cross above our eyes, The skies are in a net: And what's the thing beneath the skies We two would most forget? Not birth, my love, no, no,— Not death, my love, no, no,— The love once ours, but ours long hours ago. THE SONG OF THE BOWER Say, is it day, is it dusk in thy bower, Thou whom I long for, who longest for me? Oh! be it light, be it night, 'tis Love's hour, Love's that is fettered as Love's that is free. Free love has leaped to that innermost chamber, Oh! the last time, and the hundred before: Fettered love, motionless, can but remember, Yet something that sighs from him passes the door. Nay, but my heart when it flies to thy bower, What does it find there that knows it again? There it must droop like a shower-beaten flower, Red at the rent core and dark with the rain. Ah! yet what shelter is still shed above it,— What waters still image its leaves torn apart? Thy soul is the shade that clings round it to love it, And tears are its mirror deep down in thy heart. What were my prize, could I enter thy bower, This day, to-morrow, at eve or at morn? Large lovely arms and a neck like a tower, Bosom then heaving that now lies forlorn. Kindled with love-breath, (the sun's kiss is colder!) Thy sweetness all near me, so distant to-day; My hand round thy neck and thy hand on my shoulder, My mouth to thy mouth as the world melts away. What is it keeps me afar from thy bower,— My spirit, my body, so fain to be there? Waters engulfing or fires that devour?— Earth heaped against me or death in the air? Nay, but in day-dreams, for terror, for pity, The trees wave their heads with an omen to tell; Nay, but in night-dreams, throughout the dark city, The hours, clashed together, lose count in the bell. Shall I not one day remember thy bower, One day when all days are one day to me?— Thinking, “I stirred not, and yet had the power!”— Yearning, “Ah God, if again it might be!” Peace, peace! such a small lamp illumes, on this highway, So dimly so few steps in front of my feet,— Yet shows me that her way is parted from my way.... Out of sight, beyond light, at what goal may we meet? ON CERTAIN ELIZABETHAN REVIVALS O ruff-embastioned vast Elizabeth, Bush to these bushel-bellied casks of wine, Home-growth, 'tis true, but rank as turpentine— What would we with such skittle-plays at death? Say, must we watch these brawlers' brandished lathe, Or to their reeking wit our ears incline, Because all Castaly flowed crystalline In gentle Shakspeare's modulated breath? What! must our drama with the rat-pit vie, Nor the scene close while one is left to kill? Shall this be poetry? And thou—thou man Of blood, thou cannibalic Caliban, What shall be said of thee? A poet?—Fie! “An honourable murderer, if you will.” DANTIS TENEBRÆ (In Memory of my Father) And didst thou know indeed, when at the font Together with thy name thou gav'st me his, That also on thy son must Beatrice Decline her eyes according to her wont, Accepting me to be of those that haunt The vale of magical dark mysteries Where to the hills her poet's foot-track lies, And wisdom's living fountain to his chaunt Trembles in music? This is that steep land Where he that holds his journey stands at gaze Tow'rd sunset, when the clouds like a new height Seem piled to climb. These things I understand: For here, where day still soothes my lifted face, On thy bowed head, my father, fell the night. THE SEED OF DAVID (For a Picture) Christ sprang from David Shepherd, and even so From David King, being born of high and low. The Shepherd lays his crook, the King his crown, Here at Christ's feet, and high and low bow down. ASPECTA MEDUSA (For a Drawing) Andromeda, by Perseus saved and wed, Hankered each day to see the Gorgon's head: Till o'er a fount he held it, bade her lean, And mirrored in the wave was safely seen That death she lived by. Let not thine eyes know Any forbidden thing itself, although It once should save as well as kill: but be Its shadow upon life enough for thee. PLIGHTED PROMISE In a soft-complexioned sky, Fleeting rose and kindling grey, Have you seen Aurora fly At the break of day? So my maiden, so my plighted may Blushing cheek and gleaming eye Lifts to look my way. Where the inmost leaf is stirred With the heart-beat of the grove, Have you heard a hidden bird Cast her note above? So my lady, so my lovely love, Echoing Cupid's prompted word, Makes a tune thereof. Have you seen, at heaven's mid-height, In the moon-rack's ebb and tide, Venus leap forth burning white, Dian pale and hide? So my bright breast-jewel, so my bride, One sweet night, when fear takes flight, Shall leap against my side. THE PASSOVER IN THE HOLY FAMILY (For a Drawing The scene is in the house-porch, where Christ holds a bowl of blood from which Zacharias is sprinkling the posts and lintel. Joseph has brought the lamb and Elizabeth lignts the pyre. The shoes which John fastens and the bitter herbs which Mary is gathering form part of the ritual.) Here meet together the prefiguring day And day prefigured. “Eating, thou shalt stand, Feet shod, loins girt, thy road-staff in thine hand, With blood-stained door and lintel,”—did God say By Moses' mouth in ages passed away. And now, where this poor household doth comprise At Paschal-Feast two kindred families,— Lo! the slain lamb confronts the Lamb to slay. The pyre is piled. What agony's crown attained, What shadow of Death the Boy's fair brow subdues Who holds that blood wherewith the porch is stained By Zachary the priest? John binds the shoes He deemed himself not worthy to unloose; And Mary culls the bitter herbs ordained. VENUS VERTICORDIA (For a Picture) She hath the apple in her hand for thee, Yet almost in her heart would hold it back; She muses, with her eyes upon the track Of that which in thy spirit they can see. Haply, “Behold, he is at peace,” saith she; “Alas! the apple for his lips,—the dart That follows its brief sweetness to his heart,— The wandering of his feet perpetually!” A little space her glance is still and coy; But if she give the fruit that works her spell, Those eyes shall flame as for her Phrygian boy. Then shall her bird's strained throat the woe foretell, And her far seas moan as a single shell, And through her dark grove strike the light of Troy. PANDORA (For a Picture) What of the end, Pandora? Was it thine, The deed that set these fiery pinions free? Ah! wherefore did the Olympian consistory In its own likeness make thee half divine? Was it that Juno's brow might stand a sign For ever? and the mien of Pallas be A deadly thing? and that all men might see In Venus' eyes the gaze of Proserpine? What of the end? These beat their wings at will, The ill-born things, the good things turned to ill,— Powers of the impassioned hours prohibited. Aye, clench the casket now! Whither they go Thou mayst not dare to think: nor canst thou know If Hope still pent there be alive or dead. A SEA-SPELL (For a Picture) Her lute hangs shadowed in the apple-tree, While flashing fingers weave the sweet-strung spell Between its chords; and as the wild notes swell, The sea-bird for those branches leaves the sea. But to what sound her listening ear stoops she? What netherworld gulf-whispers doth she hear, In answering echoes from what planisphere, Along the wind, along the estuary? She sinks into her spell: and when full soon Her lips move and she soars into her song, What creatures of the midmost main shall throng In furrowed surf-clouds to the summoning rune; Till he, the fated mariner, hears her cry, And up her rock, bare-breasted, comes to die? FOR “THE WINE OF CIRCE” BY EDWARD BURNE JONES Dusk-haired and gold-robed o'er the golden wine She stoops, wherein, distilled of death and shame, Sink the black drops; while, lit with fragrant flame, Round her spread board the golden sunflowers shine. Doth Helios here with Hecaté combine (O Circe, thou their votaress!) to proclaim For these thy guests all rapture in Love's name, Till pitiless Night give Day the countersign? Lords of their hour, they come. And by her knee Those cowering beasts, their equals heretofore, Wait; who with them in new equality To-night shall echo back the sea's dull roar With a vain wail from passion's tide-strown shore Where the dishevelled seaweed hates the sea. LOVE-LILY Between the hands, between the brows, Between the lips of Love-Lily, A spirit is born whose birth endows My blood with fire to burn through me; Who breathes upon my gazing eyes, Who laughs and murmurs in mine ear, At whose least touch my colour flies, And whom my life grows faint to hear. Within the voice, within the heart, Within the mind of Love-Lily, A spirit is born who lifts apart His tremulous wings and looks at me; Who on my mouth his finger lays, And shows, while whispering lutes confer, That Eden of Love's watered ways Whose winds and spirits worship her. Brows, hands, and lips, heart, mind, and voice, Kisses and words of Love-Lily,— Oh! bid me with your joy rejoice Till riotous longing rest in me! Ah! let not hope be still distraught, But find in her its gracious goal, Whose speech Truth knows not from her thought Nor Love her body from her soul. ENGLISH MAY Would God your health were as this month of May Should be, were this not England,—and your face Abroad, to give the gracious sunshine grace And laugh beneath the budding hawthorn-spray. But here the hedgerows pine from green to grey While yet May's lyre is tuning, and her song Is weak in shade that should in sun be strong; And your pulse springs not to so faint a lay. If in my life be breath of Italy, Would God that I might yield it all to you! So, when such grafted warmth had burgeoned through The languor of your Maytime's hawthorn-tree, My spirit at rest should walk unseen and see The garland of your beauty bloom anew. CASSANDRA (For a Drawing The subject shows Cassandra prophesying among her kindred, as Hector leaves them for his last battle. They are on the platform of a fortress, from which the Trojan troops are marching out. Helen is arming Paris; Priam soothes Hecuba; and Andromache holds the child to her bosom.) I Rend, rend thine hair, Cassandra: he will go. Yea, rend thy garments, wring thine hands, and cry From Troy still towered to the unreddened sky. See, all but she that bore thee mock thy woe:— He most whom that fair woman arms, with show Of wrath on her bent brows; for in this place This hour thou bad'st all men in Helen's face The ravished ravishing prize of Death to know. What eyes, what ears hath sweet Andromache, Save for her Hector's form and step; as tear On tear make salt the warm last kiss he gave? He goes. Cassandra's words beat heavily Like crows above his crest, and at his ear Ring hollow in the shield that shall not save. II “O Hector, gone, gone, gone! O Hector, thee Two chariots wait, in Troy long bless'd and curs'd; And Grecian spear and Phrygian sand athirst Crave from thy veins the blood of victory. Lo! long upon our hearth the brand had we, Lit for the roof-tree's ruin: and to-day The ground-stone quits the wall,—the wind hath way,— And higher and higher the wings of fire are free. “O Paris, Paris! O thou burning brand, Thou beacon of the sea whence Venus rose, Lighting thy race to shipwreck! Even that hand Wherewith she took thine apple let her close Within thy curls at last, and while Troy glows Lift thee her trophy to the sea and land.” MARY MAGDALENE At the Door of Simon the Pharisee (For a Drawing In the drawing Mary has left a procession of revellers, and is ascending by a sudden impulse the steps of the house where she sees Christ. Her lover has followed her, and is trying to turn her back.) “Why wilt thou cast the roses from thine hair? Nay, be thou all a rose,—wreath, lips, and cheek. Nay, not this house,—that banquet-house we seek; See how they kiss and enter; come thou there. This delicate day of love we two will share Till at our ear love's whispering night shall speak. What, sweet one,—hold'st thou still the foolish freak? Nay, when I kiss thy feet they'll leave the stair.” “Oh loose me! Seest thou not my Bridegroom's face That draws me to Him? For His feet my kiss, My hair, my tears He craves to-day:—and oh! What words can tell what other day and place Shall see me clasp those blood-stained feet of His? He needs me, calls me, loves me: let me go!” MICHAEL SCOTT'S WOOING (For a Drawing) Rose-sheathed beside the rosebud tongue Lurks the young adder's tooth; Milk-mild from new-born hemlock-bluth The earliest drops are wrung: And sweet the flower of his first youth When Michael Scott was young. TROY TOWN Heavenborn Helen, Sparta's queen, (O Troy Town!) Had two breasts of heavenly sheen, The sun and moon of the heart's desire: All Love's lordship lay between. (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) Helen knelt at Venus' shrine, (O Troy Town!) Saying, “A little gift is mine, A little gift for a heart's desire. Hear me speak and make me a sign! (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “Look, I bring thee a carven cup; (O Troy Town!) See it here as I hold it up,— Shaped it is to the heart's desire, Fit to fill when the gods would sup. (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “It was moulded like my breast; (O Troy Town!) He that sees it may not rest, Rest at all for his heart's desire. O give ear to my heart's behest! (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “See my breast, how like it is; (O Troy Town!) See it bare for the air to kiss! Is the cup to thy heart's desire? O for the breast, O make it his! (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “Yea, for my bosom here I sue; (O Troy Town!) Thou must give it where 'tis due, Give it there to the heart's desire. Whom do I give my bosom to? (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “Each twin breast is an apple sweet. (O Troy Town!) Once an apple stirred the beat Of thy heart with the heart's desire:— Say, who brought it then to thy feet? (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “They that claimed it then were three: (O Troy Town!) For thy sake two hearts did he Make forlorn of the heart's desire. Do for him as he did for thee! (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) “Mine are apples grown to the south, (O Troy Town!) Grown to taste in the days of drouth, Taste and waste to the heart's desire: Mine are apples meet for his mouth.” (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) Venus looked on Helen's gift, (O Troy Town!) Looked and smiled with subtle drift, Saw the work of her heart's desire:— “There thou kneel'st for Love to lift!” (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) Venus looked in Helen's face, (O Troy Town!) Knew far off an hour and place, And fire lit from the heart's desire; Laughed and said, “Thy gift hath grace!” (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) Cupid looked on Helen's breast, (O Troy Town!) Saw the heart within its nest, Saw the flame of the heart's desire,— Marked his arrow's burning crest. (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) Cupid took another dart, (O Troy Town!) Fledged it for another heart, Winged the shaft with the heart's desire, Drew the string and said, “Depart!” (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) Paris turned upon his bed, (O Troy Town!) Turned upon his bed and said, Dead at heart with the heart's desire— “Oh to clasp her golden head!” (O Troy's down, Tall Troy's on fire!) FIRST LOVE REMEMBERED Peace in her chamber, wheresoe'er It be, a holy place: The thought still brings my soul such grace As morning meadows wear. Whether it still be small and light, A maid's who dreams alone, As from her orchard-gate the moon Its ceiling showed at night: Or whether, in a shadow dense As nuptial hymns invoke, Innocent maidenhood awoke To married innocence: There still the thanks unheard await The unconscious gift bequeathed: For there my soul this hour has breathed An air inviolate. AN OLD SONG ENDED “How should I your true love know From another one?” “By his cockle-hat and staff And his sandal-shoon.” “And what signs have told you now That he hastens home?” “Lo! the spring is nearly gone, He is nearly come.” “For a token is there nought, Say, that he should bring?” “He will bear a ring I gave And another ring.” “How may I, when he shall ask, Tell him who lies there?” “Nay, but leave my face unveiled And unbound my hair.” “Can you say to me some word I shall say to him?” “Say I'm looking in his eyes Though my eyes are dim.” AFTER THE GERMAN SUBJUGATION OF FRANCE, 1871 Lo the twelfth year—the wedding-feast come round With years for months—and lo the babe new-born; Out of the womb's rank furnace cast forlorn, And with contagious effluence seamed and crown'd. To hail this birth, what fiery tongues surround Hell's Pentecost—what clamour of all cries That swell, from Absalom's scoff to Shimei's, One scornful gamut of tumultuous sound! For now the harlot's heart on a new sleeve Is prankt; and her heart's lord of yesterday (Spurned from her bed, whose worm-spun silks o'erlay Such fretwork as that other worm can weave) Takes in his ears the vanished world's last yell, And in his flesh the closing teeth of Hell. DOWN STREAM Between Holmscote and Hurstcote The river-reaches wind, The whispering trees accept the breeze, The ripple's cool and kind; With love low-whispered 'twixt the shores, With rippling laughters gay, With white arms bared to ply the oars, On last year's first of May. Between Holmscote and Hurstcote The river's brimmed with rain, Through close-met banks and parted banks Now near, now far again: With parting tears caressed to smiles, With meeting promised soon, With every sweet vow that beguiles, On last year's first of June. Between Holmscote and Hurstcote The river's flecked with foam, 'Neath shuddering clouds that hang in shrouds And lost winds wild for home: With infant wailings at the breast, With homeless steps astray, With wanderings shuddering tow'rds one rest On this year's first of May. Between Holmscote and Hurstcote The summer river flows With doubled flight of moons by night And lilies' deep repose: With lo! beneath the moon's white stare A white face not the moon, With lilies meshed in tangled hair, On this year's first of June. Between Holmscote and Hurstcote A troth was given and riven, From heart's trust grew one life to two, Two lost lives cry to Heaven: With banks spread calm to meet the sky, With meadows newly mowed, The harvest-paths of glad July, The sweet school-children's road. THE CLOUD CONFINES The day is dark and the night To him that would search their heart; No lips of cloud that will part Nor morning song in the light: Only, gazing alone, To him wild shadows are shown, Deep under deep unknown And height above unknown height. Still we say as we go,— “Strange to think by the way, Whatever there is to know, That shall we know one day.” The Past is over and fled; Named new, we name it the old; Thereof some tale hath been told But no word comes from the dead; Whether at all they be, Or whether as bond or free, Or whether they too were we, Or by what spell they have sped. Still we say as we go,— “Strange to think by the way, Whatever there is to know, That shall we know one day.” What of the heart of hate That beats in thy breast, O Time?— Red strife from the furthest prime, And anguish of fierce debate; War that shatters her slain, And peace that grinds them as grain, And eyes fixed ever in vain On the pitiless eyes of Fate. Still we say as we go,— “Strange to think by the way, Whatever there is to know, That shall we know one day.” What of the heart of love That bleeds in thy breast, O Man?— Thy kisses snatched 'neath the ban Of fangs that mock them above; Thy bells prolonged unto knells, Thy hope that a breath dispels, Thy bitter forlorn farewells And the empty echoes thereof? Still we say as we go,— “Strange to think by the way, Whatever there is to know, That shall we know one day.” The sky leans dumb on the sea, Aweary with all its wings; And oh! the song the sea sings Is dark everlastingly. Our past is clean forgot, Our present is and is not, Our future's a sealed seedplot, And what betwixt them are we?— We who say as we go— “Strange to think by the way, Whatever there is to know, That shall we know one day.” SUNSET WINGS To-night this sunset spreads two golden wings Cleaving the western sky; Winged too with wind it is, and winnowings Of birds; as if the day's last hour in rings Of strenuous flight must die. Sun-steeped in fire, the homeward pinions sway Above the dovecote-tops; And clouds of starlings, ere they rest with day, Sink, clamorous like mill-waters, at wild play, By turns in every copse: Each tree heart-deep the wrangling rout receives,— Save for the whirr within, You could not tell the starlings from the leaves; Then one great puff of wings, and the swarm heaves Away with all its din. Even thus Hope's hours, in ever-eddying flight, To many a refuge tend; With the first light she laughed, and the last light Glows round her still; who natheless in the night At length must make an end. And now the mustering rooks innumerable Together sail and soar, While for the day's death, like a tolling knell, Unto the heart they seem to cry, Farewell, No more, farewell, no more! Is Hope not plumed, as 'twere a fiery dart? And oh! thou dying day, Even as thou goest must she too depart, And Sorrow fold such pinions on the heart As will not fly away? SOOTHSAY Let no man ask thee of anything Not yearborn between Spring and Spring. More of all worlds than he can know, Each day the single sun doth show. A trustier gloss than thou canst give From all wise scrolls demonstrative, The sea doth sigh and the wind sing. Let no man awe thee on any height Of earthly kingship's mouldering might. The dust his heel holds meet for thy brow Hath all of it been what both are now; And thou and he may plague together A beggar's eyes in some dusty weather When none that is now knows sound or sight. Crave thou no dower of earthly things Unworthy Hope's imaginings. To have brought true birth of Song to be And to have won hearts to Poesy, Or anywhere in the sun or rain To have loved and been beloved again, Is loftiest reach of Hope's bright wings. The wild waifs cast up by the sea Are diverse ever seasonably. Even so the soul-tides still may land A different drift upon the sand. But one the sea is evermore: And one be still, 'twixt shore and shore, As the sea's life, thy soul in thee. Say, hast thou pride? How then may fit Thy mood with flatterers' silk-spun wit? Haply the sweet voice lifts thy crest, A breeze of fame made manifest. Nay, but then chaf'st at flattery? Pause: Be sure thy wrath is not because It makes thee feel thou lovest it. Let thy soul strive that still the same Be early friendship's sacred flame. The affinities have strongest part In youth, and draw men heart to heart: As life wears on and finds no rest, The individual in each breast Is tyrannous to sunder them. In the life-drama's stern cue-call, A friend's a part well-prized by all: And if thou meet an enemy, What art thou that none such should be? Even so: but if the two parts run Into each other and grow one, Then comes the curtain's cue to fall. Whate'er by other's need is claimed More than by thine,—to him unblamed Resign it: and if he should hold What more than he thou lack'st, bread, gold, Or any good whereby we live,— To thee such substance let him give Freely: nor he nor thou be shamed. Strive that thy works prove equal: lest That work which thou hast done the best Should come to be to thee at length (Even as to envy seems the strength Of others) hateful and abhorr'd,— Thine own above thyself made lord,— Of self-rebuke the bitterest. Unto the man of yearning thought And aspiration, to do nought Is in itself almost an act,— Being chasm-fire and cataract Of the soul's utter depths unseal'd. Yet woe to thee if once thou yield Unto the act of doing nought! How callous seems beyond revoke The clock with its last listless stroke! How much too late at length!—to trace The hour on its forewarning face, The thing thou hast not dared to do! ... Behold, this may be thus! Ere true It prove, arise and bear thy yoke. Let lore of all Theology Be to thy soul what it can be: But know,—the Power that fashions man Measured not out thy little span For thee to take the meting-rod In turn, and so approve on God Thy science of Theometry. To God at best, to chance at worst, Give thanks for good things, last as first. But windstrown blossom is that good Whose apple is not gratitude. Even if no prayer uplift thy face, Let the sweet right to render grace As thy soul's cherished child be nurs'd. Didst ever say, “Lo, I forget”? Such thought was to remember yet. As in a gravegarth, count to see The monuments of memory. Be this thy soul's appointed scope:— Gaze onward without claim to hope, Nor, gazing backward, court regret. WINTER How large that thrush looks on the bare thorn-tree! A swarm of such, three little months ago, Had hidden in the leaves and let none know Save by the outburst of their minstrelsy. A white flake here and there—a snow-lily Of last night's frost—our naked flower-beds hold; And for a rose-flower on the darkling mould The hungry redbreast gleams. No bloom, no bee. The current shudders to its ice-bound sedge; Nipped in their bath, the stark reeds one by one Flash each its clinging diamond in the sun: 'Neath winds which for this winter's sovereign pledge Shall curb great king-masts to the ocean's edge And leave memorial forest-kings o'erthrown. SPRING Soft-littered is the new-year's lambing-fold, And in the hollowed haystack at its side The shepherd lies o'nights now, wakeful-eyed At the ewes' travailing call through the dark cold. The young rooks cheep 'mid the thick caw o'the old: And near unpeopled stream-sides, on the ground, By her spring-cry the moorhen's nest is found, Where the drained flood-lands flaunt their marigold. Chill are the gusts to which the pastures cower, And chill the current where the young reeds stand As green and close as the young wheat on land: Yet here the cuckoo and the cuckoo-flower Plight to the heart Spring's perfect imminent hour Whose breath shall soothe you like your dear one's hand. UNTIMELY LOST Oliver Madox Brown. Born 1855; Died 1874 Upon the landscape of his coming life A youth high-gifted gazed, and found it fair: The heights of work, the floods of praise, were there. What friendships, what desires, what love, what wife?— All things to come. The fanned springtime was rife With imminent solstice; and the ardent air Had summer sweets and autumn fires to bear;— Heart's ease full-pulsed with perfect strength for strife. A mist has risen: we see the youth no more: Does he see on and strive on? And may we Late-tottering world-worn hence, find his to be The young strong hand which helps us up that shore? Or, echoing the No More with Nevermore, Must Night be ours and his? We hope: and he? PARTED PRESENCE Love, I speak to your heart, Your heart that is always here. Oh draw me deep to its sphere, Though you and I are apart, And yield, by the spirit's art, Each distant gift that is dear. O love, my love, you are here! Your eyes are afar to-day, Yet, love, look now in mine eyes. Two hearts sent forth may despise All dead things by the way. All between is decay, Dead hours and this hour that dies. O love, look deep in mine eyes! Your hands to-day are not here, Yet lay them, love, in my hands. The hourglass sheds its sands All day for the dead hours' bier; But now, as two hearts draw near, This hour like a flower expands. O love, your hands in my hands! Your voice is not on the air, Yet, love, I can hear your voice: It bids my heart to rejoice As knowing your heart is there,— A music sweet to declare The truth of your steadfast choice. O love, how sweet is your voice! To-day your lips are afar, Yet draw my lips to them, love. Around, beneath, and above, Is frost to bind and to bar; But where I am and you are, Desire and the fire thereof. O kiss me, kiss me, my love! Your heart is never away, But ever with mine, for ever, For ever without endeavour, To-morrow, love, as to-day; Two blent hearts never astray, Two souls no power may sever, Together, O my love, for ever! A DEATH-PARTING Leaves and rain and the days of the year, (Water-willow and wellaway,) All these fall, and my soul gives ear, And she is hence who once was here. (With a wind blown night and day.) Ah! but now, for a secret sign, (The willow's wan and the water white,) In the held breath of the day's decline Her very face seemed pressed to mine. (With a wind blown day and night.) O love, of my death my life is fain; (The willows wave on the water-way,) Your cheek and mine are cold in the rain, But warm they'll be when we meet again. (With a wind blown night and day.) Mists are heaved and cover the sky; (The willows wail in the waning light,) O loose your lips, leave space for a sigh,— They seal my soul, I cannot die. (With a wind blown day and night.) Leaves and rain and the days of the year, (Water-willow and wellaway,) All still fall, and I still give ear, And she is hence, and I am here. (With a wind blown night and day.) THREE SHADOWS I looked and saw your eyes In the shadow of your hair, As a traveller sees the stream In the shadow of the wood; And I said, “My faint heart sighs, Ah me! to linger there, To drink deep and to dream In that sweet solitude.” I looked and saw your heart In the shadow of your eyes, As a seeker sees the gold In the shadow of the stream; And I said, “Ah me! what art Should win the immortal prize, Whose want must make life cold And Heaven a hollow dream?” I looked and saw your love In the shadow of your heart, As a diver sees the pearl In the shadow of the sea; And I murmured, not above My breath, but all apart,— “Ah! you can love, true girl, And is your love for me?” ADIEU Waving whispering trees, What do you say to the breeze And what says the breeze to you? 'Mid passing souls ill at ease, Moving murmuring trees, Would ye ever wave an Adieu? Tossing turbulent seas, Winds that wrestle with these, Echo heard in the shell,— 'Mid fleeting life ill at ease, Restless ravening seas,— Would the echo sigh Farewell? Surging sumptuous skies, For ever a new surprise, Clouds eternally new,— Is every flake that flies, Widening wandering skies, For a sign—Farewell, Adieu? Sinking suffering heart That know'st how weary thou art,— Soul so fain for a flight,— Aye, spread your wings to depart, Sad soul and sorrowing heart,— Adieu, Farewell, Good-night. ASTARTE SYRIACA (For a Picture) Mystery: lo! betwixt the sun and moon Astarte of the Syrians: Venus Queen Ere Aphrodite was. In silver sheen Her twofold girdle clasps the infinite boon Of bliss whereof the heaven and earth commune: And from her neck's inclining flower-stem lean Love-freighted lips and absolute eyes that wean The pulse of hearts to the spheres' dominant tune. Torch-bearing, her sweet ministers compel All thrones of light beyond the sky and sea The witnesses of Beauty's face to be: That face, of Love's all-penetrative spell Amulet, talisman, and oracle,— Betwixt the sun and moon a mystery. CHIMES I Honey-flowers to the honey-comb, And the honey-bee's from home. A honey-comb and a honey-flower, And the bee shall have his hour. A honeyed heart for the honey-comb, And the humming bee flies home. A heavy heart in the honey-flower, And the bee has had his hour. II A honey-cell's in the honeysuckle, And the honey-bee knows it well. The honey-comb has a heart of honey, And the humming bee's so bonny. A honey-flower's the honeysuckle, And the bee's in the honey-bell. The honeysuckle is sucked of honey, And the bee is heavy and bonny. III Brown shell first for the butterfly, And a bright wing by and by. Butterfly, good-bye to your shell, And, bright wings, speed you well. Bright lamplight for the butterfly And a burnt wing by and by. Butterfly, alas for your shell, And, bright wings, fare you well. IV Lost love-labour and lullaby, And lowly let love lie. Lost love-morrow and love fellow And love's life lying low. Lovelorn labour and life laid by, And lowly let love lie. Late love-longing and life-sorrow And love's life lying low. V Beauty's body and benison With a bosom-flower new-blown. Bitter beauty and blessing bann'd With a breast to burn and brand. Beauty's bower in the dust o'erblown With a bare white breast of bone. Barren beauty and bower of sand With a blast on either hand. VI Buried bars in the breakwater And bubble of the brimming weir. Body's blood in the breakwater And a buried body's bier. Buried bones in the breakwater And bubble of the brawling weir. Bitter tears in the breakwater And a breaking heart to bear. VII Hollow heaven and the hurricane And hurry of the heavy rain. Hurried clouds in the hollow heaven And a heavy rain hard-driven. The heavy rain it hurries amain And heaven and the hurricane. Hurrying wind o'er the heaven's hollow And the heavy rain to follow. TO PHILIP BOURKE MARSTON, INCITING ME TO POETIC WORK Sweet Poet, thou of whom these years that roll Must one day yet the burdened birthright learn, And by the darkness of thine eyes discern How piercing was the sight within thy soul;— Gifted apart, thou goest to the great goal, A cloud-bound radiant spirit, strong to earn, Light-reft, that prize for which fond myriads yearn Vainly light-blest,—the Seër's aureole. And doth thine ear, divinely dowered to catch All spheral sounds in thy song blent so well, Still hearken for my voice's slumbering spell With wistful love? Ah! let the Muse now snatch My wreath for thy young brows, and bend to watch Thy veiled transfiguring sense's miracle. THE LAST THREE FROM TRAFALGAR AT THE ANNIVERSARY BANQUET, 21ST OCTOBER 187? In grappled ships around The Victory, Three boys did England's Duty with stout cheer, While one dread truth was kept from every ear, More dire than deafening fire that churned the sea: For in the flag-ship's weltering cockpit, he Who was the Battle's Heart without a peer, He who had seen all fearful sights save Fear, Was passing from all life save Victory. And round the old memorial board to-day, Three greybeards—each a warworn British Tar— View through the mist of years that hour afar: Who soon shall greet, 'mid memories of fierce fray, The impassioned soul which on its radiant way Soared through the fiery cloud of Trafalgar. FIAMMETTA (For a Picture) Behold Fiammetta, shown in Vision here. Gloom-girt 'mid Spring-flushed apple-growth she stands; And as she sways the branches with her hands, Along her arm the sundered bloom falls sheer, In separate petals shed, each like a tear; While from the quivering bough the bird expands His wings. And lo! thy spirit understands Life shaken and shower'd and flown, and Death drawn near. All stirs with change. Her garments beat the air: The angel circling round her aureole Shimmers in flight against the tree's grey bole: While she, with reassuring eyes most fair, A presage and a promise stands; as 'twere On Death's dark storm the rainbow of the Soul. MNEMOSYNE (For a Picture) Thou fill'st from the winged chalice of the soul Thy lamp, O Memory, fire-winged to its goal. JOHN KEATS The weltering London ways where children weep And girls whom none call maidens laugh,—strange road Miring his outward steps, who inly trode The bright Castalian brink and Latmos' steep:— Even such his life's cross-paths; till deathly deep He toiled through sands of Lethe; and long pain, Weary with labour spurned and love found vain, In dead Rome's sheltering shadow wrapped his sleep. O pang-dowered Poet, whose reverberant lips And heart-strung lyre awoke the Moon's eclipse,— Thou whom the daisies glory in growing o'er,— Their fragrance clings around thy name, not writ But rumour'd in water, while the fame of it Along Time's flood goes echoing evermore. THOMAS CHATTERTON With Shakspeare's manhood at a boy's wild heart,— Through Hamlet's doubt to Shakspeare near allied, And kin to Milton through his Satan's pride,— At Death's sole door he stooped, and craved a dart; And to the dear new bower of England's art,— Even to that shrine Time else had deified, The unuttered heart that soared against his side,— Drove the fell point, and smote life's seals apart. Thy nested home-loves, noble Chatterton; The angel-trodden stair thy soul could trace Up Redcliffe's spire; and in the world's armed space Thy gallant sword-play:—these to many an one Are sweet for ever; as thy grave unknown And love-dream of thine unrecorded face. WILLIAM BLAKE (To Frederick Shields, on his sketch of Blake's work-room and death-room, 3 Fountain Court, Strand) This is the place. Even here the dauntless soul, The unflinching hand, wrought on; till in that nook, As on that very bed, his life partook New birth, and passed. Yon river's dusky shoal, Whereto the close-built coiling lanes unroll, Faced his work-window, whence his eyes would stare, Thought-wandering, unto nought that met them there, But to the unfettered irreversible goal. This cupboard, Holy of Holies, held the cloud Of his soul writ and limned; this other one, His true wife's charge, full oft to their abode Yielded for daily bread the martyr's stone, Ere yet their food might be that Bread alone, The words now home-speech of the mouth of God. THE DAY-DREAM (For a Picture) The thronged boughs of the shadowy sycamore Still bear young leaflets half the summer through; From when the robin 'gainst the unhidden blue Perched dark, till now, deep in the leafy core, The embowered throstle's urgent wood-notes soar Through summer silence. Still the leaves come new; Yet never rosy-sheathed as those which drew Their spiral tongues from spring-buds heretofore. Within the branching shade of Reverie Dreams even may spring till autumn; yet none be Like woman's budding day-dream spirit-fann'd. Lo! tow'rd deep skies, not deeper than her look, She dreams; till now on her forgotten book Drops the forgotten blossom from her hand. SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE His Soul fared forth (as from the deep home-grove The father-songster plies the hour-long quest), To feed his soul-brood hungering in the nest; But his warm Heart, the mother-bird, above Their callow fledgling progeny still hove With tented roof of wings and fostering breast Till the Soul fed the soul-brood. Richly blest From Heaven their growth, whose food was Human Love. Yet ah! Like desert pools that show the stars Once in long leagues,—even such the scarce-snatched hours Which deepening pain left to his lordliest powers:— Heaven lost through spider-trammelled prison-bars. Six years, from sixty saved! Yet kindling skies Own them, a beacon to our centuries. FOR SPRING BY SANDRO BOTTICELLI (In the Accademia of Florence) What masque of what old wind-withered New-Year Honours this Lady? The same lady, here surrounded by the masque of Spring, is evidently the subject of a portrait by Botticelli formerly in the Pourtalès collection in Paris. This portrait is inscribed “Smeralda Bandinelli.” Flora, wanton-eyed For birth, and with all flowrets prankt and pied: Aurora, Zephyrus, with mutual cheer Of clasp and kiss: the Graces circling near, 'Neath bower-linked arch of white arms glorified: And with those feathered feet which hovering glide O'er Spring's brief bloom, Hermes the harbinger. Birth-bare, not death-bare yet, the young stems stand This Lady's temple-columns: o'er her head Love wings his shaft. What mystery here is read Of homage or of hope? But how command Dead Springs to answer? And how question here These mummers of that wind-withered New-Year? FOR THE HOLY FAMILY BY MICHELANGELO. (In the National Gallery In this picture the Virgin Mother is seen withholding from the Child Saviour the prophetic writings in which His sufferings are foretold. Angelic figures beside them examine a scroll.) Turn not the prophet's page, O Son! He knew All that Thou hast to suffer, and hath writ. Not yet Thine hour of knowledge. Infinite The sorrows that Thy manhood's lot must rue And dire acquaintance of Thy grief. That clue The spirits of Thy mournful ministerings Seek through yon scroll in silence. For these things The angels have desired to look into. Still before Eden waves the fiery sword,— Her Tree of Life unransomed: whose sad Tree Of Knowledge yet to growth of Calvary Must yield its Tempter,—Hell the earliest dead Of Earth resign,—and yet, O Son and Lord, The seed o'the woman bruise the serpent's head. TIBER, NILE, AND THAMES The head and hands of murdered Cicero, Above his seat high in the Forum hung, Drew jeers and burning tears. When on the rung Of a swift-mounted ladder, all aglow, Fulvia, Mark Antony's shameless wife, with show Of foot firm-poised and gleaming arm upflung, Bade her sharp needle pierce that god-like tongue Whose speech fed Rome even as the Tiber's flow. And thou, Cleopatra's Needle, that hadst thrid Great skirts of Time ere she and Antony hid Dead hope!—hast thou too reached, surviving death, A city of sweet speech scorned,—on whose chill stone Keats withered, Coleridge pined, and Chatterton, Breadless, with poison froze the God-fired breath? “FOUND” (For a Picture) “There is a budding morrow in midnight:”— So sang our Keats, our English nightingale. And here, as lamps across the bridge turn pale In London's smokeless resurrection-light, Dark breaks to dawn. But o'er the deadly blight Of Love deflowered and sorrow of none avail, Which makes this man gasp and this woman quail, Can day from darkness ever again take flight? Ah! gave not these two hearts their mutual pledge, Under one mantle sheltered 'neath the hedge In gloaming courtship? And, O God! to-day He only knows he holds her;—but what part Can life now take? She cries in her locked heart,— “Leave me—I do not know you—go away!” CZAR ALEXANDER THE SECOND (13TH MARCH 1881) From him did forty million serfs, endow'd Each with six feet of death-due soil, receive Rich freeborn lifelong land, whereon to sheave Their country's harvest. These to-day aloud Demand of Heaven a Father's blood,—sore bow'd With tears and thrilled with wrath; who, while they grieve, On every guilty head would fain achieve All torment by his edicts disallow'd. He stayed the knout's red-ravening fangs; and first Of Russian traitors, his own murderers go White to the tomb. While he,—laid foully low With limbs red-rent, with festering brain which erst Willed kingly freedom,—'gainst the deed accurst To God bears witness of his people's woe. ALAS, SO LONG! Ah! dear one, we were young so long, It seemed that youth would never go, For skies and trees were ever in song And water in singing flow In the days we never again shall know. Alas, so long! Ah! then was it all Spring weather? Nay, but we were young and together. Ah! dear one, I've been old so long, It seems that age is loth to part, Though days and years have never a song, And oh! have they still the art That warmed the pulses of heart to heart? Alas, so long! Ah! then was it all Spring weather? Nay, but we were young and together. Ah! dear one, you've been dead so long,— How long until we meet again, Where hours may never lose their song Nor flowers forget the rain In glad noonlight that never shall wane? Alas, so long! Ah! shall it be then Spring weather, And ah! shall we be young together? INSOMNIA Thin are the night-skirts left behind By daybreak hours that onward creep, And thin, alas! the shred of sleep That wavers with the spirit's wind: But in half-dreams that shift and roll And still remember and forget, My soul this hour has drawn your soul A little nearer yet. Our lives, most dear, are never near, Our thoughts are never far apart, Though all that draws us heart to heart Seems fainter now and now more clear. To-night Love claims his full control, And with desire and with regret My soul this hour has drawn your soul A little nearer yet. Is there a home where heavy earth Melts to bright air that breathes no pain, Where water leaves no thirst again And springing fire is Love's new birth? If faith long bound to one true goal May there at length its hope beget, My soul that hour shall draw your soul For ever nearer yet. POSSESSION There is a cloud above the sunset hill, That wends and makes no stay, For its goal lies beyond the fiery west; A lingering breath no calm can chase away, The onward labour of the wind's last will; A flying foam that overleaps the crest Of the top wave: and in possession still A further reach of longing; though at rest From all the yearning years, Together in the bosom of that day Ye cling, and with your kisses drink your tears. PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY (Inscription for the couch, still preserved, on which he passed the last night of his life.) 'Twixt those twin worlds,—the world of Sleep, which gave No dream to warn,—the tidal world of Death, Which the earth's sea, as the earth, replenisheth,— Shelley, Song's orient sun, to breast the wave, Rose from this couch that morn. Ah! did he brave Only the sea?—or did man's deed of hell Engulph his bark 'mid mists impenetrable? ... No eye discerned, nor any power might save. When that mist cleared, O Shelley! what dread veil Was rent for thee, to whom far-darkling Truth Reigned sovereign guide through thy brief ageless youth? Was the Truth thy Truth, Shelley?—Hush! All-Hail! Past doubt, thou gav'st it; and in Truth's bright sphere Art first of praisers, being most praisèd here. RALEIGH'S CELL IN THE TOWER Here writ was the World's History by his hand Whose steps knew all the earth; albeit his world In these few piteous paces then was furl'd. Here daily, hourly, have his proud feet spann'd This smaller speck than the receding land Had ever shown his ships; what time he hurl'd Abroad o'er new-found regions spiced and pearl'd His country's high dominion and command. Here dwelt two spheres. The vast terrestrial zone His spirit traversed; and that spirit was Itself the zone celestial, round whose birth The planets played within the zodiac's girth; Till hence, through unjust death unfeared, did pass His spirit to the only land unknown. SPHERAL CHANGE In this new shade of Death, the show Passes me still of form and face; Some bent, some gazing as they go, Some swiftly, some at a dull pace, Not one that speaks in any case. If only one might speak!—the one Who never waits till I come near; But always seated all alone As listening to the sunken air, Is gone before I come to her. O dearest! while we lived and died A living death in every day, Some hours we still were side by side, When where I was you too might stay And rest and need not go away. O nearest, furthest! Can there be At length some hard-earned heart-won home, Where,—exile changed for sanctuary,— Our lot may fill indeed its sum, And you may wait and I may come?</field>

O Thou that in no house dost dwell, But walk'st in tent and tabernacle. For God of all strokes will have one In every battle that is done. Lancelot lay beside the well: (God's Graal is good) Oh my soul is sad to tell The weary quest and the bitter quell; For he was the lord of lordlihood, And sleep on his eyelids fell. Lancelot lay before the shrine; (The apple tree's in the wood) There was set Christ's very sign, The bread unknown and the unknown wine That the soul's life for a livelihood Craves from his wheat and vine. [As much as in a hundred years, she's dead] As much as in a hundred years, she's dead: Yet is to-day the day on which she died. ON BURNS In whomsoe'er, since Poesy began, A Poet most of all men we may scan, Burns of all poets is the most a Man. THE ORCHARD-PIT Piled deep below the screening apple-branch They lie with bitter apples in their hands: And some are only ancient bones that blanch, And some had ships that last year's wind did launch, And some were yesterday the lords of lands. In the soft dell, among the apple-trees, High up above the hidden pit she stands, And there for ever sings, who gave to these, That lie below, her magic hour of ease, And those her apples holden in their hands. This in my dreams is shown me; and her hair Crosses my lips and draws my burning breath; Her song spreads golden wings upon the air, Life's eyes are gleaming from her forehead fair, And from her breasts the ravishing eyes of Death. Men say to me that sleep hath many dreams, Yet I knew never but this dream alone: There, from a dried-up channel, once the stream's, The glen slopes up; even such in sleep it seems As to my waking sight the place well known. My love I call her, and she loves me well: But I love her as in the maelstrom's cup The whirled stone loves the leaf inseparable That clings to it round all the circling swell, And that the same last eddy swallows up. TO ART I loved thee ere I loved a woman, Love. FIOR DI MAGGIO Oh! May sits crowned with hawthorn-flower, And is Love's month, they say; And Love's the fruit that is ripened best By ladies' eyes in May. [“I saw the Sibyl at Cumæ”] And the Sibyl, you know. I saw her with my own eyes at Cumæ, hanging in a jar; and, when the boys asked her, “What would you, Sibyl?” she answered, “I would die.” —Petronius. “I saw the Sibyl at Cumæ” (One said) “with mine own eye. She hung in a cage, and read her rune To all the passers-by. Said the boys, ‘What wouldst thou, Sibyl?’ She answered, ‘I would die.’” [As balmy as the breath of her you love] As balmy as the breath of her you love When deep between her breasts it comes to you. [“Was it a friend or foe that spread these lies?”] “Was it a friend or foe that spread these lies?” “Nay, who but infants question in such wise? 'Twas one of my most intimate enemies.” [If I could die like the British Queen] If I could die like the British Queen Who faced the Roman war, Or hang in a cage for my country's sake Like Black Bess of Dunbar! [She bound her green sleeve on my helm] She bound her green sleeve on my helm, Sweet pledge of love's sweet meed: Warm was her bared arm round my neck As well she bade me speed; And her kiss clings still between my lips, Heart's beat and strength at need. [Where is the man whose soul has never waked] Where is the man whose soul has never waked To sudden pity of the poor torn past? [At her step the water-hen] At her step the water-hen Springs from her nook, and skimming the clear stream, Ripples its waters in a sinuous curve, And dives again in safety.

[I shut myself in with my soul] I shut myself in with my soul, And the shapes come eddying forth. [“I hate” says over and above] “I hate” says over and above “This is a soul that I might love.” None lightly says “My friend”: even so Be jealous of that name “My foe.” An enemy for an enemy, But dogs for what a dog can be. Hold those at heart, and time shall prove. [Do still thy best, albeit the clue] Do still thy best, albeit the clue Be snapt of that thou strovest to; Do still thy best, though direful hate Should toil to leave thee desolate. Do still thy best whom Fate would damn. Say—such as I was made I am, And did even such as I could do. Anomalies against all rules Acknowledge, though beyond the schools:— Those passionate states when to know true Some thing, and to believe, are two; And that extraordinary sect Whom no amount of intellect Can save, alas, from being fools.

[For this can love, and does love, and loves me. ] For this can love, and does love, and loves me. (or) For this can love, and does, and loves but me. [The forehead veiled and the veiled throat of Death.] The forehead veiled and the veiled throat of Death. [Thou that beyond thy real self dost see] Thou that beyond thy real self dost see A self ideal, bid thy heart beware. [And plaintive days that haunt the haggard hills] And plaintive days that haunt the haggard hills With bleak unspoken woe. [To know for certain that we do not know] To know for certain that we do not know Is the first step in knowledge. [Think through this silence how when we are old] Think through this silence how when we are old We two shall think upon this place and day.

[O thou whose name, being alone, aloud] O thou whose name, being alone, aloud I utter oft, and though thou art not there, Toward thine imaged presence kiss the air. [I saw the love which was my life flow past] I saw the love which was my life flow past 'Twixt shadowed reaches, like a murmuring stream:— I was awake, and lo it was a dream. [Or give ten years of life's most bitter wane] Or give ten years of life's most bitter wane To see the loved one as she was again. [And of the cup of human agony] And of the cup of human agony Enough to fill the sea. [Even as the moon grows clearer on the sky] Even as the moon grows clearer on the sky While the sky darkens, and her Venus-star Thrills with a keener radiance from afar. [(The Imperial Cloak—Paludamentum).] (The Imperial Cloak—Paludamentum). Imperatorial car, And purple-dyed paludament of war. MY LADY (Canzone) I'll tell you of my Lady all I know; And, if my lady knew That I would tell this, she would etc. etc. And say, “Why, all is his, so let him tell.” She is full of incidents, like all beautiful Nature. Then follow descriptive lines about her different attitudes, expressions, etc. Perhaps to wind up by saying that nothing one can say is so expressive of her as her own name, which means herself only: and that cannot be said for others to hear. LAST LOVE (Canzone) Love hath a chamber all of imagery; And there is one dim nook, A little storied web wherein my heart From leaf to leaf is read as in a book. One part in the middle of the web begun and left unfinished; a face with ravelled threads falling over it and hiding it. Love says that the time has come to resume and finish this part of the web, though much has come between since it was begun. [For the garlands of heaven were all laid by] For the garlands of heaven were all laid by, And the Daylight sucked at the breasts of a Lie. [The wounded hart and the dying swan] The wounded hart and the dying swan Were side by side Where the rushes coil with the turn of the tide— The hart and the swan. (In the alternate stanzas—The swan and the hart.) [Within those eyes the sedulous yearning throe.] Within those eyes the sedulous yearning throe. And all the evil of my heart A thousand times forgotten. [Ah if you had been lost for many years] Ah if you had been lost for many years, And from the dead to-day were risen again! ON THE TWO BRIDAL-BIERS How sweet a solace is the bridal-bed— Dawn as prepared, evening as hallowèd. [Fashioned with intricate infinity.] Fashioned with intricate infinity. [Ah dear one, we were young so long] Ah dear one, we were young so long I thought that youth would never wane— Ah dear one, I've been old so long, How long until we meet again? JOAN OF ARC This word had Merlin said from of old:— That out of the Oak Tree Shade In the day of France's direst dule, God's hand should send a Maid. And where Domremy, by Burgundy, Sits crowned with its oakenshaw, Even there Joan d'Arc, the Maid of God's Ark, The light of the day first saw. Where spirits go, what man may know? Yet this may of man be said:— That, when Time is o'er and all hath sufficed, Shall the world's chief Christ-fire rise to Christ From the ashes of Joan the Maid. [The tombless fossil of deep-buried days.] The tombless fossil of deep-buried days. [And 'mid the budding branches' sway] And 'mid the budding branches' sway Our antlers met in battle-play When our fetlocks felt the Spring.

DÎS MANIBUS Gustave Flaubert, whose honoured rôle Was to be scribe to Nero's soul, And make French flesh to creep and crow O'er Carthaginian Salammbô, Lies here—in body, as in the brain, Like Morgue-corpse tumid from the Seine. What shall be writ above his grave? Vitellius', Nero's dying stave? “Fui Imperator,” shall it flow, Or “Qualis artifex pereo”? [“Ah lads, I knew your father.” What wide world] “Ah lads, I knew your father.” What wide world Of meaning in those words! They mean that he, Being gone before, has known that mystery From living Plato and Socrates fast-furl'd. [This little day—a bird that flew to me—] This little day—a bird that flew to me— Has swiftly flown out of my hand again. Ah have I listened to its fugitive strain For what its tidings of the sky may be? [No ship came near: aloof with heed] No ship came near: aloof with heed They tacked, as still as death; For round our walls the sea was dense With reefs whose sharp circumference Was the great stronghold's sure defence. [And plaintive days that haunt the haggard hills] And plaintive days that haunt the haggard hills With bleak unspoken woe.

YOUTH AND LORDSHIP (Italian Street-Song) My young lord's the lover Of earth and sky above, Of youth's sway and youth's play, Of songs and flowers and love. Yet for love's desire Green youth lacks the daring; Though one dream of fire, All his hours ensnaring, Burns the boy past bearing— The dream that girls inspire. My young lord's the lover Of every burning thought That Love's will, that Love's skill Within his breast has wrought. Lovely girl, look on him Soft as music's measure; Yield him, when you've won him Joys and toys at pleasure; But to win your treasure, Softly look upon him. My young lord's the lover Of every tender grace That woman, to woo man, Can wear in form or face. Take him to your bosom Now, girl, or never; Let not your new blossom Of sweet kisses sever; Only guard for ever Your boast within your bosom. My young lord's the lover Of every secret thing, Love-hidden, love-bidden This day to banqueting. Lovely girl, with vaunting Never tempt to-morrow: From all shapes enchanting Any joy can borrow, Still the spectre Sorrow Rises up for haunting. And now my lord's the lover Of ah! so many a sweet,— Of roses, of spouses, As many as love may greet.

Afar the flowers of Enna from this drear Dire fruit, which, tasted once, must thrall me here. Afar those skies from this Tartarean grey That chills me: and afar, how far away, The nights that shall be from the days that were. Afar from mine own self I seem, and wing Strange ways in thought, and listen for a sign: And still some heart unto some soul doth pine, (Whose sounds mine inner sense is fain to bring, Continually together murmuring,)— “Woe's me for thee, unhappy Proserpine!” LA BELLA MANO (For a Picture) O lovely hand, that thy sweet self dost lave In that thy pure and proper element, Whence erst the Lady of Love's high advènt Was born, and endless fires sprang from the wave:— Even as her Loves to her their offerings gave, For thee the jewelled gifts they bear; while each Looks to those lips, of music-measured speech The fount, and of more bliss than man may crave.

Upon this earth that thou hast left Hadst thou not much to do? Would not thy joys have been a crowd And thy troubles small and few? “Beauty and rank and friends and wealth, Genius and excellence,— Could not all these, thy heritage, Win thee from hastening hence?

Back with it all though, Mary, Back and aside; The wind comes this way, Mary, And here the trees are airy And the skies are wide. What do your eyes fear, Mary, So grave and soft? I love to see them, Mary, In whimsical vagary Lifted aloft. Mary, Mary, Mary, Laugh in my face: You know now, my own Mary, No eyes can laugh so rarely Or grant such grace. Your cheek is pale now, Mary, And red, by turns. Why should the hand be chary Of that to give which, Mary, The heart so yearns? Give me your hand, ah Mary, Give me your hand: In city or in prairie There is none kinder, Mary, From land to land. Your lips to my lips, Mary, Your lips to mine: High up in Hebe's dairy No milk so sweet, my Mary, On earth no wine.

Ho ye that nothing have to lose! ho rouse ye, one and all! Come from the sinks of the New Cut, the purlieus of Vauxhall! Did ye not hear the mighty sound boom by ye as it went— The Seven Dials strike the hour of man's enfranchisement? Ho cock your eyes, my gallant pals, and swing your heavy staves: Remember—Kings and Queens being out, the great cards will be Knaves. And when the pack is ours—oh then at what a slapping pace Shall the tens be trodden down to five, and the fives kicked down to ace! It was but yesterday the Times and Post and Telegraph Told how from France King Louy-Phil. was shaken out like chaff; To-morrow, boys, the National, the Siècle, and the Débats, Shall have to tell the self-same tale of “La Reine Victoria.” What! shall our incomes we've not got be taxed by puny John? Shall the policeman keep Time back by bidding us move on? Shall we too follow in the steps of that poor sneak Cochrane? Shall it be said, “They came, they saw,—and bolted back again”? Not so! albeit great men have been among us, and are floor'd— (Frost, Williams, Jones, and other ones who now reside abroad)— Among the master-spirits of the age there still are those Who'll pick up fame—even though, when smelt, it makes men hold the nose.

Yon column is a prouder thing than Cæsar's triumph-arch! It shall be called “The Column of the Glorious Days of March!” And stonemasons' apprentices shall grow rich men therewith, By contract-chiselling the names of Jones and Brown and Smith. Upon what point of London, say, shall our next vengeance burst? Shall the Exchange, or Parliament, be immolated first? Which of the Squares shall we burn down?—which of the Palaces?

A little scorn They showed—a very little. More forlorn She seemed because of that: she might have grown Proud else in her turn, and have so made known What she well knew—that the free-hearted corn, Kissed by the hot air freely all the morn, Is better than the weed which has its own Foul glut in secret. Both her white breasts heaved Like heaving water with their weight of lace; And her long tresses, full of musk and myrrh, Were shaken from the braids her fingers weaved, So that they hid the shame in her pale face. Then I stept forth, and bowed addressing her. AFTERWARDS She opened her moist crimson lips to sing; And from her throat that is so white and full The notes leaped like a fountain. A smooth lull Was o'er my heart: as when—a viol-string Having been broken—the first musical ring Once over, all the rest is but a dull Crude dissonance, howe'er thou twist and pull The sundered fragments. A most weary thing It is within the perished heart to seek Pain, and not find it, but a clinging pall Like sleep upon the mind. The mere set plan Of life then comes, and grief that is not weak Because it has no tears. Life's all-in-all Was certainly at end when this began. ONE OF TIME'S RIDDLES In her deep bosom the pride settled down— That pride which is a brackish thing like salt; And the life in her pulses seemed to halt. About her temples for an iron crown She set stern patience. She did never frown, But her long gaze was gentle to a fault; And, looking deep into her eyes, you had call'd Their lustre nothing but a mild clear brown. She lives and moves and is a mystery. That which she hath been the thought cannot touch; Only, beholding what she is, it hath Glimpses of something she is yet to be; And at the least it knows of her thus much:— She bides her season with a solemn faith. ANOTHER LOVE Of her I thought who now is gone so far: And, the thought passing over, to fall thence Was like a fall from spirit into sense Or from the heaven of heavens to sun and star. None other than Love's self ordained the bar 'Twixt her and me; so that if, going hence, I met her, it could only seem a dense Film of the brain,—just nought, as phantoms are. Now when I passed your threshold and came in, And glanced where you were sitting, and did see Your tresses in these braids and your hands thus,— I knew that other figure, grieved and thin, That seemed there, yea that was there, could not be, Though like God's wrath it stood dividing us. THE WORLD'S DOING One scarce would think that we can be the same Who used, in those first childish Junes, to creep With held breath through the underwood, and leap Outside into the sun. Since this mine aim Took me unto itself, the joy which came Into my eyes at once sits hushed and deep; Nor even the sorrow moans, but falls asleep And has ill dreams. For you—your very name Seems altered in mine ears, and cannot send Heat through my heart, as in those days afar Wherein we lived indeed with the real life. Yet why should we feel shame, my dear sweet friend? Are they most honoured who without a scar Pace forth, all trim and fresh, from the splashed strife? ALMOST OVER You say I should not think upon her now: But then I have stood beside her listening, And watched her rose-breathed lips when she would sing: And I can scarcely yet imagine how I ever should despise that stately brow And flowering breast that is so pure a thing. Alas for all the weary blood-running When from the heart love strives to tear a vow! And yet perchance—even as you tell me—soon Her spirit of my spirit will leave hold, And, when I hear her tread, I shall not blush Doubly, for love and shame. But then the moon Assuredly will rise, and Sleep shall fold Her hair round me, and Death will whisper Hush! HIDDEN HARMONY The thoughts in me are very calm and high That think upon your love: yet by your leave You shall not greatly marvel that this eve Or nightfall—yet scarce nightfall—the strong sky Leaves me thus sad. Now if you ask me why, I cannot teach you, dear; but I believe It is that man will always interweave Life with fresh want, with wish or fear to die. It may be therefore,—though the matter touch Nowise our love,—that I so often look Sad in your presence, often feeling so. And of the reason I can tell thus much:— Man's soul is like the music in a book Which were not music but for high and low. AN ALTAR-FLAME Even as when utter summer makes the grain Bow heavily along through the whole land It seems to me whatever while I stand Where thou art standing; and upon my brain Thy presence weighs like a most awful strain Of music, heard in some cathedral fanned With the deep breath of prayer, while the priest's hand Uplifts the solemn sign which shall remain After the world. Thy beauty perfecteth A noble calmness in me; it doth send Through my weak heart to my strong mind a rule Of life that they shall keep till shut of death: Death—an arched path too long to see the end, But which hath shadows that seem pure and cool. HEIGHT IN DEPTH He turned his face apart, and gave a sigh And a strange whimper—such a pitiful thing As haunts the heart for days. “Yes, Love can bring Unto a pass so low that it seems high: And, when we see a brave and strong man cry With a poor infant's feeble sorrowing, It is a nobler passion than to wing Shafts of small angers and small prides,” thought I. There is a love so deaf that it can hear Not even its own voice which bids it seek A name for its own meanness: it would find The outlet else. But thus it is a sheer Humility—an earnestness so meek That your knees bow and sharp tears make you blind. AT ISSUE That voice I hear,—how heard I cannot tell,— Although my home is this, seems from my home: There ... still it trails along and murmurs “Come”; Like the slow death of sound within a bell, Or like the humming whine in some pink shell Wet with the brittle beadage of the foam Which bird-eyed damsels stoop for when they roam By the old sea. Were't not exceeding well To shake my soul out of this tiresome life For a call any-whence and any-whither? That voice knows all the life I have or had, And mocks me not,—it's whisper is too sad. Even to attain calm sorrow lures me thither, Since here this search for joy wearies like strife. PRAISE AND PRAYER Doubt spake no word in me as there I kneeled. Loathing, I could not praise: I could not thank God for the cup of evil that I drank: I dared not cry upon His strength to shield My soul from weapons it was bent to wield Itself against itself. And so I sank Into the furnished phrases smooth and blank Which we all learn in childhood,—and did yield A barren prayer for life. My voice might mix With hers, but mingled not. Hers was a full Grand burst of music, which the crownèd Seven Must have leaned sideways from their seats to fix In their calm minds. The seraph-songs fell dull Doubtless, when heard again, throughout all heaven. THE TURNING-POINT At length I sickened, standing in the sun Truthful and for the Truth, whose only fees Are madness and sharp death. I bowed my knees And said: “As long as the world's years have run, These accents have been said and these things done: That which is mine abasement is their ease: They say, ‘Go to—all this is as we please: Shall we, being many, step aside for one?’ “And thus it is that though the air be new, And my brow finds the coolness it hath sought Through the slow-stricken night,—the daily curse Weighs on my soul of what I waken to: For though I loathe the price, this must be bought.” ... Thou fool! Would'st buy from man what God confers? A FORETASTE At length the then of my long hope was now; Yet had my spirit an extreme unrest: I knew the good from better was grown best At length, but could not just as yet tell how. So I lay straight along, and thrust my brow Under the heights of grass. Hours struck. The West, I knew, must be at change; but gazed not, lest The heat against my naked face (no bough For shade) should tease me mad, like poisoned spice. I lay along, letting my whole self think, Pressing my brow down that the thoughts might fix: Just as a dicer who holds loaded dice, Sure of his cast, keeps trifling with his drink Ere he will throw, and still must taste and mix. IDLE BLESSEDNESS I know not how it is, I have the knack, In lazy moods, of seeking no excuse; But holding that man's ease must be the juice Of man's philosophy, I give the sack To thought, and lounge at shuffle on the track Of what employment seems of the least use: And in such ways I find a constant sluice For drowzy humours. Be thou loth to rack And hack thy brain for thought, which may lurk there Or may not. Without pain of thought, the eyes Can see, the ears can hear, the sultry mouth Can taste the summer's favour. Towards the South Let earth sway round, while this my body lies In warmth, and has the sun on face and hair. “'TWAS THUS” “'Twas thus, thus is, and thus shall be: The Beautiful—the Good— Still mirror to the Human Soul Its own intensitude!” A PRAYER Lady, in thy proud eyes There is a weary look, As if the spirit we know through them Were daunted with rebuke To think that the heart of man henceforth Is read like a read book. Lady, in thy lifted face The solitude is sore; The true solitude follows the crowd. Will it be less or more When the words have been spoken to thee Which my heart is seeking for? Lady, canst thou not guess The words which my thoughts seek? Perhaps thou deem'st them well to spurn And better not to speak. Oh thou must know my love is strong, Hearing my voice so weak. Lady, ah go not thus: Lady, give ear again: Lady, oh learn from me that yet There may one thing remain Which stands not in the knowledge thou hast And in thy lore of men. Lady, the darkness lasteth long Ere the dawn touch the skies; Many are the leagues of wilderness Till ye come where the green lies; Nay often betwixt doubt and doubt Death whispers and makes wise. Lady, has not my thought Dared much? For I would be The ending of darkness and the dawn Of a new day to thee, And thine oasis, and thy place of rest, And thy time of peace, lady. ON BROWNING'S SORDELLO “Sordello's story,” the Sphinx yawned and said, “Who would has heard.” Is that enough? Who could, 'Twere not amiss to add, has understood: Who understood perhaps has profited. For my part I could tell a tale instead Of one who, dreaming of no likelihood Even that the “Book” was going to end for good, Turned the last page, and lo the book was read. THE CAN-CAN AT VALENTINO'S (N.B.—The numerical characteristics refer to the danseuses.) The first, a mare; the second, 'twixt bow-wow And pussy-cat, a cross; the third, a beast To baffle Buffon; the fourth, not the least In hideousness, nor last; the fifth, a cow; The sixth, Chimera; the seventh, Sphinx; ... Come now, One woman, France, ere this frog-hop have ceased, And it shall be enough. A toothsome feast Of blackguardism ... and bald row, No doubt for such as love those same. For me, I confess, William, and avow to thee, (Soft in thine ear) that such sweet female whims Are not a passion of mine naturally. AT THE STATION OF THE VERSAILLES RAILWAY I waited for the train unto Versailles. I hung with bonnes and gamins on the bridge Watching the gravelled road where, ridge with ridge, Under black arches gleam the iron rails Clear in the darkness, till the darkness fails And they press on to light again—again To reach the dark. I waited for the train Unto Versailles; I leaned over the bridge, And wondered, cold and drowsy, why the knave Claude is in worship; and why (sense apart) Rubens preferred a mustard vehicle. The wind veered short. I turned upon my heel Saying, “Correggio was a toad”; then gave Three dizzy yawns, and knew not of the Art. L'ENVOI: BRUSSELS, HÔTEL DU MIDI 18 October It's copied out at last: very poor stuff Writ in the cold, with pauses of the cramp. Direct, dear William, to the Poste Restante At Ghent—here written Gand—Gong, Hunticè. We go to Antwerp first, but shall not stay; After, to Ghent and Bruges; and after that To Ostend, and thence home. To Waterloo Was yesterday. Thither, and there, and back, I managed to scrawl something,—most of it Bad, and the sonnet at the close mere slosh. 'Twas only made because I was knocked up, And it helped yawning. Take it, and the rest. SIR PETER PAUL RUBENS (Antwerp) “Messieurs, le Dieu des peintres”: We felt odd: 'Twas Rubens, sculptured. A mean florid church Was the next thing we saw,—from vane to porch His drivel. The museum: as we trod Its steps, his bust held us at bay. The clod Has slosh by miles along the wall within. (“I say, I somehow feel my gorge begin To rise.”)—His chair in a glass case, by God! ... To the Cathedral. Here too the vile snob Has fouled in every corner. (“Wherefore brave Our fate? Let's go.”) There is a monument We pass. “Messieurs, you tread upon the grave Of the great Rubens.” “Well, that's one good job! What time this evening is the train for Ghent?” BETWEEN GHENT AND BRUGES (Wednesday night, 24 October) Ah yes, exactly so; but when a man Has trundled out of England into France And half through Belgium, always in this prance Of steam, and still has stuck to his first plan— Blank verse or sonnets; and as he began Would end;—why, even the blankest verse may chance To falter in default of circumstance, And even the sonnet miss its mystic span. Trees will be trees, grass grass, pools merely pools, Unto the end of time and Belgium—points Of fact which Poets (very abject fools) Get scent of—once their epithets grown tame And scarce. Even to these foreign rails—my joints Begin to find their jolting much the same. VERSES TO JOHN TUPPER Dear Jack Alack! A few days back I bound myself by oath to smack My lips o'er sloshy tea, and attack White, brown, or black Bread, and vile jokes to crack, This night with brutes whose knack Would squeeze a pun in Syriac. And for to-morrow, alack! I have a model on my track, So that I may not pack. Of course I writhe upon the rack: Though as to Nature, Jack, (Poor dear old hack!) Touching sky, sun, stone, stick, and stack, I guess I'm half a quack; For whom ten lines of Browning whack The whole of the Zodiac. Nevertheless, alack! Seeing this time I must send back To Prince and Baron, Stephens and Jack (Spec-cadav Rex, hic hæc hoc hac), And to the Maniac, The sack. This much from D.G.R. (in black, I.e., with coal-ash cloth-of-sack.) ST. WAGNES' EVE The hop-shop is shut up: the night doth wear. Here, early, Collinson this evening fell “Into the gulfs of sleep”; and Deverell Has turned upon the pivot of his chair The whole of this night long; and Hancock there Has laboured to repeat, in accents screechy, “Guardami ben, ben son, ben son Beatrice”; And Bernhard Smith still beamed, serene and square. By eight, the coffee was all drunk. At nine We gave the cat some milk. Our talk did shelve, Ere ten, to gasps and stupor. Helpless grief Made, towards eleven, my inmost spirit pine, Knowing North's hour. And Hancock, hard on twelve, Showed an engraving of his bas-relief. PARODY ON “UNCLE NED” Dere was an old nigger, and him name was Uncle Tom, And him tale was rather slow; Me try to read de whole, but me only read some, Because me found it no go. Den hang up de auther Mrs. Stowe, And kick de volume wid your toe— And dere's no more public for poor Uncle Tom, He am gone whar de trunk-lining go. Him tale dribbles on and on widout a break, Till you hab no eyes for to see; When I reached Chapter 4 I had got a headache, So I had to let Chapter 4 be. Den hang up, etc. De demand one fine morning for Uncle Tom died, De tears down Mrs. Stowe's face ran like rain; For she knew berry well, now dey'd laid him on de shelf, Dat she'd neber get a publisher again. Den hang up, etc. DUNS SCOTUS Here lies Duns Scotus Who died of lotus. MacCracken (Parody on Tennyson's “Kraken”) Getting his pictures, like his supper, cheap, Far, far away in Belfast by the sea, His watchful one-eyed uninvaded sleep MacCracken sleepeth. While the P.R.B. Must keep the shady side, he walks a swell Through spungings of perennial growth and height: And far away in Belfast out of sight, By many an open do and secret sell, Fresh daubers he makes shift to scarify, And fleece with pliant shears the slumbering “green.” There he has lied, though aged, and will lie, Fattening on ill-got pictures in his sleep, Till some Præraphael prove for him too deep. Then, once by Hunt and Ruskin to be seen, Insolvent he will turn, and in the Queen's Bench die. VALENTINE—TO LIZZIE SIDDAL Yesterday was St. Valentine. Thought you at all, dear dove divine, Upon the beard in sorry trim And rueful countenance of him, That Orson who's your Valentine? He daubed, you know, as usual. The stick would slip, the brush would fall: Yet daubed he till the lamplighter Set those two seedy flames astir; But growled all day at slow St. Paul. The bore was heard ere noon; the dun Was at the door by half-past one: At least 'tis thought so, but the clock— No Lizzy there to help its stroke— Struck work before the day begun. At length he saw St. Paul's bright orb Flash back—the serried tide absorb That burning West which it sucked up, Like wine poured in a water cup;— And one more twilight toned his daub. Some time over the fire he sat, So lonely that he missed his cat; Then wildly rushed to dine on tick,— Nine minutes swearing for his stick, And thirteen minutes for his hat. And now another day is gone: Once more that intellectual one Desists from high-minded pursuits, And hungry, staring at his boots, Has not the strength to pull them on. Come back, dear Liz, and looking wise In that arm-chair which suits your size Through some fresh drawing scrape a hole. Your Valentine &amp; Orson's soul Is sad for those two friendly eyes. ADDRESS TO THE DALZIEL BROTHERS “O Woodman, spare that block, Oh gash not anyhow! It took ten days by clock, I'd fain protect it now.” Chorus —Wild Laughter from Dalziel's Workshop. THE WOMBAT Oh how the family affections combat Within this heart, and each hour flings a bomb at My burning soul! Neither from owl nor from bat Can peace be gained until I clasp my wombat. LIMERICKS There is a big artist named Val, The roughs' and the prize-fighters' pal: The mind of a groom And the head of a broom Were Nature's endowments to Val. There is a Creator named God Whose creations are sometimes quite odd: I maintain—and I shall— The creation of Val Reflects little credit on God. There is a dull Painter named Wells Who is duller than any one else: With the face of a horse He sits by you and snorts— Which is very offensive in Wells. There's an infantine Artist named Hughes— Him and his the R.A.'s did refuse: At length, though, among The lot, one was hung— But it was himself in a noose. There's a babyish party named Burges Who from infancy hardly emerges: If you had not been told He's disgracefully old, You would offer a bull's-eye to Burges. There is a young person named Georgie Who indulges each night in an orgy: Soda-water and brandy Are always kept handy To efface the effects of that orgy. There is a young Artist named Jones Whose conduct no genius atones: His behaviour in life Is a pang to the wife And a plague to the neighbours of Jones. There is a young Painter called Jones (A cheer here, and hisses, and groans): The state of his mind Is a shame to mankind, But a matter of triumph to Jones. There's a Painter of Portraits named Chapman Who in vain would catch woman or trap man To be painted life-size More preposterous guys Than they care to be painted by Chapman. There's a combative Artist named Whistler Who is, like his own hog-hairs, a bristler: A tube of white lead And a punch on the head Offer varied attractions to Whistler. There's a publishing party named Ellis Who's addicted to poets with bellies: He has at least two— One in fact, one in view— And God knows what will happen to Ellis. There's a Portuguese person named Howell Who lays-on his lies with a trowel: Should he give-over lying, 'Twill be when he's dying, For living is lying with Howell. There is a mad Artist named Inchbold With whom you must be at a pinch bold: Or else you may score The brass plate on your door With the name of J. W. Inchbold. A Historical Painter named Brown Was in manners and language a clown: At epochs of victual Both pudden and kittle Were expressions familiar to Brown There was a young rascal called Nolly Whose habits though dirty were jolly; And when this book comes To be marked with his thumbs You may know that its owner is Nolly. There are dealers in pictures named Agnew Whose soft soap would make an old rag new: The Father of Lies With his tail to his eyes Cries—“Go it, Tom Agnew, Bill Agnew!” There's a solid fat German called Huffer A hypochondriacal buffer: To declaim Schopenhauer From the top of a tower Is the highest ambition of Huffer. There's a Scotch correspondent named Scott Thinks a penny for postage a lot: Books, verses, and letters, Too good for his betters, Cannot screw out an answer from Scott. There's a foolish old Scotchman called Scotus, Most justly a Pictor Ignotus: For what he best knew He never would do, This stubborn [old] donkey called Scotus. There once was a painter named Scott Who seemed to have hair, but had not. He seemed too to have sense: 'Twas an equal pretence On the part of the painter named Scott. There's the Irishman Arthur O'Shaughnessy— On the chessboard of poets a pawn is he: Though a bishop or king Would be rather the thing To the fancy of Arthur O'Shaughnessy. There is a young Artist named Knewstub, Who for personal cleaning will use tub: But in matters of paint Not the holiest Saint Was ever so dirty as Knewstub. There is a poor sneak called Rossetti: As a painter with many kicks met he— With more as a man— But sometimes he ran, And that saved the rear of Rossetti. As a critic, the Poet Buchanan Thinks Pseudo much safer than Anon. Into Maitland he shrunk, But the smell of the skunk Guides the shuddering nose to Buchanan. ON WILLIAM MORRIS Enter Skald, moored in a punt, And jacks and tenches exeunt. THE BROTHERS: BY A SCOTCH BARD AND ENGLISH REVIEWER I am two brothers with one face, So which is the real man who can trace? (My wrongs are raging inside of me.) Here are some poets and they sell, Therefore revenge becomes me well. (Oh Robert-Thomas is dread to see.) Of course you know it's a burning shame, But of my last books the press makes game! (My wrongs are boiling inside of me.) So at least all other bards I'll slate Till no one sells but the Laureate. (Oh Robert-Thomas is dread to see.) I took a beast of a poet's tome And nailed a cheque, and brought them home; (My wrongs were howling inside of me.) And after supper, in lieu of bed, I wound wet towels round my head. (Oh Robert-Thomas is dread to see.) Of eyelids kissed and all the rest, And rosy cheeks that lie on one's breast, (My wrongs were yelling inside of me) I told the worst that pen can tell,— And Strahan and Company loved me well. (Oh Robert-Thomas is dread to see.) I crowed out loud in the silent night, I made my digs so sharp and bright: (My wrongs were gnashing inside of me.) In our Contemptible Review I struck the beggar through and through. (Oh Robert-Thomas is dread to see.) I tanned his hide and combed his head, And that bard, for one, I left for dead. (My wrongs are hooting inside of me.) And now he's wrapped in a printer's sheet, Let's fling him at our Public's feet. (Oh Robert-Thomas is dread to see.) SMITHEREENS Uncertain-Aged Miss Thereabouts, Tough fossil of her teens, Has lifted up with saving hand The ruined Smithereens. Down the dark steps of debt that hand Sped like an angel's wing, Deep-dowered with gold, and for itself Brought back a golden ring. Ah lovely Lucy Lovandove, That ring's a snake, and means Woe without end: therein lies crushed Thy heart—to smithereens. ON CHRISTINA ROSSETTI There's a female bard, grim as a fakier, Who daily grows shakier and shakier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS DANTE AND HIS CIRCLE With the Italian Poets preceding Him (1100—1200—1300) A COLLECTION OF LYRICS TRANSLATED IN THE ORIGINAL METRES PART I Dante's Vita Nuova, etc. Poets of Dante's Circle TO MY MOTHER I DEDICATE THIS NEW EDITION OF A BOOK PRIZED BY HER LOVE THE NEW LIFE. [To every heart which the sweet pain doth move] To every heart which the sweet pain doth move, And unto which these words may now be brought For true interpretation and kind thought, Be greeting in our Lord's name, which is Love. Of those long hours wherein the stars above Wake and keep watch, the third was almost nought, When Love was shown me with such terrors fraught As may not carelessly be spoken of. He seemed like one who is full of joy, and had My heart within his hand, and on his arm My lady, with a mantle round her, slept; Whom (having wakened her) anon he made To eat that heart; she ate, as fearing harm. Then he went out; and as he went, he wept. [All ye that pass along Love's trodden way] All ye that pass along Love's trodden way, Pause ye awhile and say If there be any grief like unto mine: I pray you that you hearken a short space Patiently, if my case Be not a piteous marvel and a sign. Love (never, certes, for my worthless part, But of his own great heart), Vouchsafed to me a life so calm and sweet That oft I heard folk question as I went What such great gladness meant:— They spoke of it behind me in the street. But now that fearless bearing is all gone Which with Love's hoarded wealth was given me; Till I am grown to be So poor that I have dread to think thereon. And thus it is that I, being like as one Who is ashamed and hides his poverty, Without seem full of glee, And let my heart within travail and moan. I [Weep, Lovers, sith Love's very self doth weep] Weep, Lovers, sith Love's very self doth weep, And sith the cause for weeping is so great; When now so many dames, of such estate In worth, show with their eyes a grief so deep: For Death the churl has laid his leaden sleep Upon a damsel who was fair of late, Defacing all our earth should celebrate,— Yea all save virtue, which the soul doth keep. Now hearken how much Love did honour her. I myself saw him in his proper form Bending above the motionless sweet dead, And often gazing into Heaven; for there The soul now sits which when her life was warm Dwelt with the joyful beauty that is fled. II [Death, alway cruel, Pity's foe in chief] Death, alway cruel, Pity's foe in chief, Mother who brought forth grief, Merciless judgment and without appeal! Since thou alone hast made my heart to feel This sadness and unweal, My tongue upbraideth thee without relief. And now (for I must rid thy name of ruth) Behoves me speak the truth Touching thy cruelty and wickedness: Not that they be not known; but ne'ertheless I would give hate more stress With them that feed on love in very sooth. Out of this world thou hast driven courtesy, And virtue, dearly prized in womanhood; And out of youth's gay mood The lovely lightness is quite gone through thee. Whom now I mourn, no man shall learn from me Save by the measure of these praises given. Whoso deserves not Heaven May never hope to have her company. [A day agone, as I rode sullenly] A day agone, as I rode sullenly Upon a certain path that liked me not, I met Love midway while the air was hot, Clothed lightly as a wayfarer might be. And for the cheer he showed, he seemed to me As one who hath lost lordship he had got; Advancing tow'rds me full of sorrowful thought, Bowing his forehead so that none should see. Then as I went, he called me by my name, Saying: “I journey since the morn was dim Thence where I made thy heart to be: which now I needs must bear unto another dame.” Wherewith so much passed into me of him That he was gone, and I discerned not how. [Song, 'tis my will that thou do seek out Love] Song, 'tis my will that thou do seek out Love, And go with him where my dear lady is; That so my cause, the which thy harmonies Do plead, his better speech may clearly prove. Thou goest, my Song, in such a courteous kind, That even companionless Thou mayst rely on thyself anywhere. And yet, an thou wouldst get thee a safe mind, First unto Love address Thy steps; whose aid, mayhap, 'twere ill to spare, Seeing that she to whom thou mak'st thy prayer Is, as I think, ill-minded unto me, And that if Love do not companion thee, Thou'lt have perchance small cheer to tell me of. With a sweet accent, when thou com'st to her, Begin thou in these words, First having craved a gracious audience: “He who hath sent me as his messenger, Lady, thus much records, An thou but suffer him, in his defence. Love, who comes with me, by thine influence Can make this man do as it liketh him: Wherefore, if this fault is or doth but seem Do thou conceive: for his heart cannot move.” Say to her also: “Lady, his poor heart Is so confirmed in faith That all its thoughts are but of serving thee: 'Twas early thine, and could not swerve apart.” Then, if she wavereth, Bid her ask Love, who knows if these things be. And in the end, beg of her modestly To pardon so much boldness: saying too:— “If thou declare his death to be thy due, The thing shall come to pass, as doth behove.’ Then pray thou of the Master of all ruth, Before thou leave her there, That he befriend my cause and plead it well. “In guerdon of my sweet rhymes and my truth” (Entreat him) “stay with her; Let not the hope of thy poor servant fail; And if with her thy pleading should prevail, Let her look on him and give peace to him.” Gentle my Song, if good to thee it seem, Do this: so worship shall be thine and love. [All my thoughts always speak to me of Love] All my thoughts always speak to me of Love, Yet have between themselves such difference That while one bids me bow with mind and sense, A second saith, “Go to: look thou above”; The third one, hoping, yields me joy enough; And with the last come tears, I scarce know whence: All of them craving pity in sore suspense, Trembling with fears that the heart knoweth of. And thus, being all unsure which path to take, Wishing to speak I know not what to say, And lose myself in amorous wanderings: Until, (my peace with all of them to make,) Unto mine enemy I needs must pray, My Lady Pity, for the help she brings. [Even as the others mock, thou mockest me] Even as the others mock, thou mockest me; Not dreaming, noble lady, whence it is That I am taken with strange semblances, Seeing thy face which is so fair to see: For else, compassion would not suffer thee To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs as these. Lo! Love, when thou art present, sits at ease, And bears his mastership so mightily That all my troubled senses he thrusts out, Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some, Till none but he is left and has free range To gaze on thee. This makes my face to change Into another's; while I stand all dumb, And hear my senses clamour in their rout. [The thoughts are broken in my memory] The thoughts are broken in my memory, Thou lovely Joy, whene'er I see thy face; When thou art near me, Love fills up the space, Often repeating, “If death irk thee, fly.” My face shows my heart's colour, verily, Which, fainting, seeks for any leaning-place; Till, in the drunken terror of disgrace, The very stones seem to be shrieking, “Die!” It were a grievous sin, if one should not Strive then to comfort my bewildered mind (Though merely with a simple pitying) For the great anguish which thy scorn has wrought In the dead sight o'the eyes grown nearly blind, Which look for death as for a blessed thing. [At whiles (yea oftentimes) I muse over] At whiles (yea oftentimes) I muse over The quality of anguish that is mine Through Love: then pity makes my voice to pine, Saying, “Is any else thus, anywhere?” Love smiteth me, whose strength is ill to bear; So that of all my life is left no sign Except one thought; and that, because 'tis thine, Leaves not the body but abideth there. And then if I, whom other aid forsook, Would aid myself, and innocent of art Would fain have sight of thee as a last hope, No sooner do I lift mine eyes to look Than the blood seems as shaken from my heart, And all my pulses beat at once and stop. [Ladies that have intelligence in love] Ladies that have intelligence in love, Of mine own lady I would speak with you; Not that I hope to count her praises through, But telling what I may, to ease my mind. And I declare that when I speak thereof, Love sheds such perfect sweetness over me That if my courage failed not, certainly To him my listeners must be all resign'd. Wherefore I will not speak in such large kind That mine own speech should foil me, which were base; But only will discourse of her high grace In these poor words, the best that I can find, With you alone, dear dames and damozels: 'Twere ill to speak thereof with any else. An Angel, of his blessed knowledge, saith To God: “Lord, in the world that Thou hast made, A miracle in action is display'd, By reason of a soul whose splendours fare Even hither: and since Heaven requireth Nought saving her, for her it prayeth Thee, Thy Saints crying aloud continually.” Yet Pity still defends our earthly share In that sweet soul; God answering thus the prayer: “My well-belovèd, suffer that in peace Your hope remain, while so My pleasure is, There where one dwells who dreads the loss of her: And who in Hell unto the doomed shall say, ‘I have looked on that for which God's chosen pray.’” My lady is desired in the high Heaven: Wherefore, it now behoveth me to tell, Saying: Let any maid that would be well Esteemed keep with her: for as she goes by, Into foul hearts a deathly chill is driven By Love, that makes ill thought to perish there: While any who endures to gaze on her Must either be ennobled, or else die. When one deserving to be raised so high Is found, 'tis then her power attains its proof, Making his heart strong for his soul's behoof With the full strength of meek humility. Also this virtue owns she, by God's will: Who speaks with her can never come to ill. Love saith concerning her: “How chanceth it That flesh, which is of dust, should be thus pure?” Then, gazing always, he makes oath: “Forsure, This is a creature of God till now unknown.” She hath that paleness of the pearl that's fit In a fair woman, so much and not more; She is as high as Nature's skill can soar; Beauty is tried by her comparison. Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon, Spirits of love do issue thence in flame, Which through their eyes who then may look on them Pierce to the heart's deep chamber every one. And in her smile Love's image you may see; Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly. Dear Song, I know thou wilt hold gentle speech With many ladies, when I send thee forth: Wherefore (being mindful that thou hadst thy birth From Love, and art a modest, simple child), Whomso thou meetest, say thou this to each: “Give me good speed! To her I wend along In whose much strength my weakness is made strong.” And if, i'the end, thou wouldst not be beguiled Of all thy labour, seek not the defiled And common sort; but rather choose to be Where man and woman dwell in courtesy. So to the road thou shalt be reconciled, And find the lady, and with the lady, Love. Commend thou me to each, as doth behove. [Love and the gentle heart are one same thing] Love and the gentle heart are one same thing, Even as the wise man Guido Guinicelli, in the canzone which begins, “Within the gentle heart Love shelters him.” (See page 432.) in his ditty saith: Each, of itself, would be such life in death As rational soul bereft of reasoning. 'Tis Nature makes them when she loves: a king Love is, whose palace where he sojourneth Is called the Heart; there draws he quiet breath At first, with brief or longer slumbering. Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind Will make the eyes desire, and through the heart Send the desiring of the eyes again; Where often it abides so long enshrin'd That Love at length out of his sleep will start. And women feel the same for worthy men. [My lady carries love within her eyes] My lady carries love within her eyes; All that she looks on is made pleasanter; Upon her path men turn to gaze at her; He whom she greeteth feels his heart to rise, And droops his troubled visage, full of sighs, And of his evil heart is then aware: Hate loves, and pride becomes a worshipper. O women, help to praise her in somewise. Humbleness, and the hope that hopeth well, By speech of hers into the mind are brought, And who beholds is blessèd oftenwhiles. The look she hath when she a little smiles Cannot be said, nor holden in the thought; 'Tis such a new and gracious miracle. [You that thus wear a modest countenance] I You that thus wear a modest countenance With lids weigh'd down by the heart's heaviness, Whence come you, that among you every face Appears the same, for its pale troubled glance? Have you beheld my lady's face, perchance, Bow'd with the grief that Love makes full of grace? Say now, “This thing is thus”; as my heart says, Marking your grave and sorrowful advance. And if indeed you come from where she sighs And mourns, may it please you (for his heart's relief) To tell how it fares with her unto him Who knows that you have wept, seeing your eyes, And is so grieved with looking on your grief That his heart trembles and his sight grows dim. II Canst thou indeed be he that still would sing Of our dear lady unto none but us? For though thy voice confirms that it is thus, Thy visage might another witness bring. And wherefore is thy grief so sore a thing That grieving thou mak'st others dolorous? Hast thou too seen her weep, that thou from us Canst not conceal thine inward sorrowing? Nay, leave our woe to us: let us alone: 'Twere sin if one should strive to soothe our woe, For in her weeping we have heard her speak: Also her look's so full of her heart's moan That they who should behold her, looking so, Must fall aswoon, feeling all life grow weak. [A very pitiful lady, very young] A very pitiful lady, very young, Exceeding rich in human sympathies, Stood by, what time I clamour'd upon Death; And at the wild words wandering on my tongue And at the piteous look within mine eyes She was affrighted, that sobs choked her breath. So by her weeping where I lay beneath, Some other gentle ladies came to know My state, and made her go: Afterward, bending themselves over me, One said, “Awaken thee!” And one, “What thing thy sleep disquieteth?” With that, my soul woke up from its eclipse, The while my lady's name rose to my lips: But utter'd in a voice so sob-broken, So feeble with the agony of tears, That I alone might hear it in my heart; And though that look was on my visage then Which he who is ashamed so plainly wears, Love made that I through shame held not apart, But gazed upon them. And my hue was such That they look'd at each other and thought of death; Saying under their breath Most tenderly, “O let us comfort him:” Then unto me: “What dream Was thine, that it hath shaken thee so much?” And when I was a little comforted, “This, ladies, was the dream I dreamt,” I said. “I was a-thinking how life fails with us Suddenly after such a little while; When Love sobb'd in my heart, which is his home. Whereby my spirit wax'd so dolorous That in myself I said, with sick recoil: ‘Yea, to my lady too this Death must come.’ And therewithal such a bewilderment Possess'd me, that I shut mine eyes for peace; And in my brain did cease Order of thought, and every healthful thing. Afterwards, wandering Amid a swarm of doubts that came and went, Some certain women's faces hurried by, And shrieked to me, ‘Thou too shalt die, shalt die!’ “Then saw I many broken hinted sights In the uncertain state I stepp'd into. Meseem'd to be I know not in what place, Where ladies through the streets, like mournful lights, Ran with loose hair, and eyes that frighten'd you, By their own terror, and a pale amaze: The while, little by little, as I thought, The sun ceased, and the stars began to gather, And each wept at the other; And birds dropp'd in mid-flight out of the sky; And earth shook suddenly; And I was 'ware of one, hoarse and tired out, Who ask'd of me: ‘Hast thou not heard it said? ... Thy lady, she that was so fair, is dead.’ “Then lifting up mine eyes, as the tears came, I saw the Angels, like a rain of manna, In a long flight flying back Heavenward; Having a little cloud in front of them, After the which they went and said, ‘Hosanna’; And if they had said more, you should have heard. Then Love said, ‘Now shall all things be made clear: Come and behold our lady where she lies.’ These 'wildering phantasies Then carried me to see my lady dead. Even as I there was led, Her ladies with a veil were covering her; And with her was such very humbleness That she appeared to say, ‘I am at peace.’ “And I became so humble in my grief, Seeing in her such deep humility, That I said: ‘Death, I hold thee passing good Henceforth, and a most gentle sweet relief, Since my dear love has chosen to dwell with thee: Pity, not hate, is thine, well understood. Lo! I do so desire to see thy face That I am like as one who nears the tomb; My soul entreats thee, Come.’ Then I departed, having made my moan; And when I was alone I said, and cast my eyes to the High Place: ‘Blessed is he, fair soul, who meets thy glance!’ ... Just then you woke me, of your complaisaùnce.” [I felt a spirit of love begin to stir] I felt a spirit of love begin to stir Within my heart, long time unfelt till then; And saw Love coming towards me fair and fain, (That I scarce knew him for his joyful cheer), Saying, “Be now indeed my worshipper!” And in his speech he laugh'd and laugh'd again. Then, while it was his pleasure to remain, I chanced to look the way he had drawn near, And saw the Ladies Joan and Beatrice Approach me, this the other following, One and a second marvel instantly. And even as now my memory speaketh this, Love spake it then: “The first is christen'd Spring; The second Love, she is so like to me.” [My lady looks so gentle and so pure] My lady looks so gentle and so pure When yielding salutation by the way, That the tongue trembles and has nought to say, And the eyes, which fain would see, may not endure. And still, amid the praise she hears secure, She walks with humbleness for her array; Seeming a creature sent from Heaven to stay On earth, and show a miracle made sure. She is so pleasant in the eyes of men That through the sight the inmost heart doth gain A sweetness which needs proof to know it by: And from between her lips there seems to move A soothing essence that is full of love, Saying for ever to the spirit, “Sigh!” [For certain he hath seen all perfectness] For certain he hath seen all perfectness Who among other ladies hath seen mine: They that go with her humbly should combine To thank their God for such peculiar grace. So perfect is the beauty of her face That it begets in no wise any sign Of envy, but draws round her a clear line Of love, and blessed faith, and gentleness. Merely the sight of her makes all things bow: Not she herself alone is holier Than all; but hers, through her, are raised above. From all her acts such lovely graces flow That truly one may never think of her Without a passion of exceeding love. [Love hath so long possessed me for his own] Love hath so long possessed me for his own And made his lordship so familiar That he, who at first irked me, is now grown Unto my heart as its best secrets are. And thus, when he in such sore wise doth mar My life that all its strength seems gone from it, Mine inmost being then feels throughly quit Of anguish, and all evil keeps afar. Love also gathers to such power in me That my sighs speak, each one a grievous thing, Always soliciting My lady's salutation piteously. Whenever she beholds me, it is so, Who is more sweet than any words can show. [The eyes that weep for pity of the heart] The eyes that weep for pity of the heart Have wept so long that their grief languisheth, And they have no more tears to weep withal: And now, if I would ease me of a part Of what, little by little, leads to death, It must be done by speech, or not at all. And because often, thinking, I recall How it was pleasant, ere she went afar, To talk of her with you, kind damozels, I talk with no one else, But only with such hearts as women's are. And I will say,—still sobbing as speech fails,— That she hath gone to Heaven suddenly, And hath left Love below, to mourn with me. Beatrice is gone up into high Heaven, The kingdom where the angels are at peace; And lives with them: and to her friends is dead. Not by the frost of winter was she driven Away, like others; nor by summer-heats; But through a perfect gentleness, instead. For from the lamp of her meek lowlihead Such an exceeding glory went up thence That it woke wonder in the Eternal Sire, Until a sweet desire Entered Him for that lovely excellence, So that He bade her to Himself aspire; Counting this weary and most evil place Unworthy of a thing so full of grace. Wonderfully out of the beautiful form Soared her clear spirit, waxing glad the while; And is in its first home, there where it is. Who speaks thereof, and feels not the tears warm Upon his face, must have become so vile As to be dead to all sweet sympathies. Out upon him! an abject wretch like this May not imagine anything of her,— He needs no bitter tears for his relief. But sighing comes, and grief, And the desire to find no comforter, (Save only Death, who makes all sorrow brief,) To him who for a while turns in his thought How she hath been among us, and is not. With sighs my bosom always laboureth In thinking, as I do continually, Of her for whom my heart now breaks apace; And very often when I think of death, Such a great inward longing comes to me That it will change the colour of my face; And, if the idea settles in its place, All my limbs shake as with an ague-fit: Till, starting up in wild bewilderment, I do become so shent That I go forth, lest folk misdoubt of it. Afterward, calling with a sore lament On Beatrice, I ask, “Canst thou be dead?” And calling on her, I am comforted. Grief with its tears, and anguish with its sighs, Come to me now whene'er I am alone; So that I think the sight of me gives pain. And what my life hath been, that living dies, Since for my lady the New Birth's begun, I have not any language to explain. And so, dear ladies, though my heart were fain, I scarce could tell indeed how I am thus. All joy is with my bitter life at war; Yea, I am fallen so far That all men seem to say, “Go out from us,” Eyeing my cold white lips, how dead they are. But she, though I be bowed unto the dust, Watches me; and will guerdon me, I trust. Weep, pitiful Song of mine, upon thy way, To the dames going and the damozels For whom and for none else Thy sisters have made music many a day. Thou, that art very sad and not as they, Go dwell thou with them as a mourner dwells. [Stay now with me, and listen to my sighs] Stay now with me, and listen to my sighs, Ye piteous hearts, as pity bids ye do. Mark how they force their way out and press through; If they be once pent up, the whole life dies. Seeing that now indeed my weary eyes Oftener refuse than I can tell to you (Even though my endless grief is ever new,) To weep and let the smothered anguish rise. Also in sighing ye shall hear me call On her whose blessed presence doth enrich The only home that well befitteth her: And ye shall hear a bitter scorn of all Sent from the inmost of my spirit in speech That mourns its joy and its joy's minister. [Whatever while the thought comes over me] Whatever while the thought comes over me That I may not again Behold that lady whom I mourn for now, About my heart my mind brings constantly So much of extreme pain That I say, Soul of mine, why stayest thou? Truly the anguish, Soul, that we must bow Beneath, until we win out of this life, Gives me full oft a fear that trembleth: So that I call on Death Even as on Sleep one calleth after strife, Saying, Come unto me. Life showeth grim And bare; and if one dies, I envy him. For ever, among all my sighs which burn, There is a piteous speech That clamours upon death continually: Yea, unto him doth my whole spirit turn Since first his hand did reach My lady's life with most foul cruelty. But from the height of woman's fairness, she, Going up from us with the joy we had, Grew perfectly and spiritually fair; That so she spreads even there A light of Love which makes the Angels glad, And even unto their subtle minds can bring A certain awe of profound marvelling. [That lady of all gentle memories] That lady of all gentle memories Had lighted on my soul;—whose new abode Lies now, as it was well ordained of God, Among the poor in heart, where Mary is. Love, knowing that dear image to he his, Woke up within the sick heart sorrow-bow'd, Unto the sighs which are its weary load Saying, “Go forth.” And they went forth, I wis; Forth went they from my breast that throbbed and ached; With such a pang as oftentimes will bathe Mine eyes with tears when I am left alone. And still those sighs which drew the heaviest breath Came whispering thus: “O noble intellect! It is a year to-day that thou art gone.” Second Commencement That lady of all gentle memories Had lighted on my soul;—for whose sake flowed The tears of Love; in whom the power abode Which led you to observe while I did this. Love, knowing that dear image to be his, etc. [Mine eyes beheld the blessed pity spring] Mine eyes beheld the blessed pity spring Into thy countenance immediately A while agone, when thou beheldst in me The sickness only hidden grief can bring; And then I knew thou wast considering How abject and forlorn my life must be; And I became afraid that thou shouldst see My weeping, and account it a base thing. Therefore I went out from thee; feeling how The tears were straightway loosened at my heart Beneath thine eyes' compassionate control; And afterwards I said within my soul: “Lo! with this lady dwells the counterpart Of the same Love who holds me weeping now.” [Love's pallor and the semblance of deep ruth] Love's pallor and the semblance of deep ruth Were never yet shown forth so perfectly In any lady's face, chancing to see Grief's miserable countenance uncouth, As in thine, lady, they have sprung to soothe, When in mine anguish thou hast looked on me; Until sometimes it seems as if, through thee, My heart might almost wander from its truth. Yet so it is, I cannot hold mine eyes From gazing very often upon thine In the sore hope to shed those tears they keep; And at such time, thou mak'st the pent tears rise Even to the brim, till the eyes waste and pine; Yet cannot they, while thou art present, weep. [“The very bitter weeping that ye made] “The very bitter weeping that ye made So long a time together, eyes of mine, Was wont to make the tears of pity shine In other eyes full oft, as I have said. But now this thing were scarce rememberèd If I, on my part, foully would combine With you, and not recall each ancient sign Of grief, and her for whom your tears were shed. It is your fickleness that doth betray My mind to fears, and makes me tremble thus What while a lady greets me with her eyes. Except by death, we must not any way Forget our lady who is gone from us.” So far doth my heart utter, and then sighs. [A gentle thought there is will often start] A gentle thought there is will often start, Within my secret self, to speech of thee: Also of Love it speaks so tenderly That much in me consents and takes its part. “And what is this,” the soul saith to the heart, “That cometh thus to comfort thee and me, And thence where it would dwell, thus potently Can drive all other thoughts by its strange art?” And the heart answers: “Be no more at strife 'Twixt doubt and doubt: this is Love's messenger And speaketh but his words, from him received; And all the strength it owns and all the life It draweth from the gentle eyes of her Who, looking on our grief, hath often grieved.” [Woe's me! by dint of all these sighs that come] Woe's me! by dint of all these sighs that come Forth of my heart, its endless grief to prove, Mine eyes are conquered, so that even to move Their lids for greeting is grown troublesome, They wept so long that now they are grief's home, And count their tears all laughter far above; They wept till they are circled now by Love With a red circle in sign of martyrdom. These musings, and the sighs they bring from me, Are grown at last so constant and so sore That love swoons in my spirit with faint breath; Hearing in those sad sounds continually The most sweet name that my dead lady bore, With many grievous words touching her death. [Ye pilgrim-folk, advancing pensively] Ye pilgrim-folk, advancing pensively As if in thought of distant things, I pray, Is your own land indeed so far away— As by your aspect it would seem to be— That this our heavy sorrow leaves you free Though passing through the mournful town mid-way; Like unto men that understand to-day Nothing at all of her great misery? Yet if ye will but stay, whom I accost, And listen to my words a little space, At going ye shall mourn with a loud voice. It is her Beatrice that she hath lost; Of whom the least word spoken holds such grace That men weep hearing it, and have no choice. [Beyond the sphere which spreads to widest space] Beyond the sphere which spreads to widest space Now soars the sigh that my heart sends above; A new perception born of grieving Love Guideth it upward the untrodden ways. When it hath reached unto the end, and stays, It sees a lady round whom splendours move In homage; till, by the great light thereof Abashed, the pilgrim spirit stands at gaze. It sees her such, that when it tells me this Which it hath seen, I understand it not, It hath a speech so subtile and so fine. And yet I know its voice within my thought Often remembereth me of Beatrice: So that I understand it, ladies mine. THE END OF THE NEW LIFE [DANTE ALIGHIERI] I TO BRUNETTO LATINI Sonnet Sent with the Vita Nuova Master Brunetto, this my little maid Is come to spend her Easter-tide with you; Not that she reckons feasting as her due,— Whose need is hardly to be fed, but read. Not in a hurry can her sense be weighed, Nor mid the jests of any noisy crew: Ah! and she wants a little coaxing too Before she'll get into another's head. But if you do not find her meaning clear, You've many Brother Alberts Probably in allusion to Albert of Cologne. Giano (Janus), which follows, was in use as an Italian name, as for instance Giano della Bella; but it seems probable that Dante is merely playfully advising his preceptor to avail himself of the twofold insight of Janus the double-faced. hard at hand, Whose wisdom will respond to any call, Consult with them and do not laugh at her; And if she still is hard to understand, Apply to Master Janus last of all. II Sonnet This and the six following pieces (with the possible exception of the canzone at page 349) seem so certainly to have been written at the same time as the poetry of the Vita Nuova, that it becomes difficult to guess why they were omitted from that work. Other poems in Dante's Canzoniere refer in a more general manner to his love for Beatrice, but each among those I allude to bears the impress of some special occasion. Of Beatrice de' Portinari, on All Saints' Day Last All Saints' holy-day, even now gone by, I met a gathering of damozels: She that came first, as one doth who excels, Had Love with her, bearing her company: A flame burned forward through her steadfast eye, As when in living fire a spirit dwells: So, gazing with the boldness which prevails O'er doubt, I knew an angel visibly. As she passed on, she bowed her mild approof And salutation to all men of worth, Lifting the soul to solemn thoughts aloof. In Heaven itself that lady had her birth, I think, and is with us for our behoof: Blessed are they who meet her on the earth. III Sonnet To certain Ladies; when Beatrice was lamenting her Father's Death See the Vita Nuova, at page 327. Whence come you, all of you so sorrowful? An it may please you, speak for courtesy. I fear for my dear lady's sake, lest she Have made you to return thus filled with dule. O gentle ladies, be not hard to school In gentleness, but to some pause agree, And something of my lady say to me, For with a little my desire is full. Howbeit it be a heavy thing to hear: For Love now utterly has thrust me forth, With hand for ever lifted, striking fear. See if I be not worn unto the earth; Yea, and my spirit must fail from me here, If, when you speak, your words are of no worth. IV Sonnet To the same Ladies; with their Answer Ye ladies, walking past me piteous-eyed, Who is the lady that lies prostrate here? Can this be even she my heart holds dear? Nay, if it be so, speak, and nothing hide. Her very aspect seems itself beside, And all her features of such altered cheer That to my thinking they do not appear Hers who makes others seem beatified. “If thou forget to know our lady thus, Whom grief o'ercomes, we wonder in no wise, For also the same thing befalleth us. Yet if thou watch the movement of her eyes, Of her thou shalt be straightway conscious. O weep no more; thou art all wan with sighs.” V Ballata He will gaze upon Beatrice Because mine eyes can never have their fill Of looking at my lady's lovely face, I will so fix my gaze That I may become blessed, beholding her. Even as an angel, up at his great height Standing amid the light, Becometh bless'd by only seeing God:— So, though I be a simple earthly wight, Yet none the less I might, Beholding her who is my heart's dear load, Be bless'd, and in the spirit soar abroad. Such power abideth in that gracious one; Albeit felt of none Save of him who, desiring, honours her. VI Canzone This poem seems probably referable to the time during which Beatrice denied her salutation to Dante. (See the Vita Nuova, at page 317 et seq.) A Complaint of his Lady's scorn Love, since it is thy will that I return 'Neath her usurped control Who is thou know'st how beautiful and proud; Enlighten thou her heart, so bidding burn Thy flame within her soul That she rejoice not when my cry is loud. Be thou but once endowed With sense of the new peace, and of this fire, And of the scorn wherewith I am despised, And wherefore death is my most fierce desire; And then thou'lt be apprised Of all. So if thou slay me afterward, Anguish unburthened shall make death less hard. O Lord, thou knowest very certainly That thou didst make me apt To serve thee. But I was not wounded yet, When under heaven I beheld openly The face which thus hath rapt My soul. Then all my spirits ran elate Upon her will to wait. And she, the peerless one who o'er all worth Is still her proper beauty's worshipper, Made semblance then to guide them safely forth: And they put faith in her: Till, gathering them within her garment all, She turned their blessed peace to tears and gall. Then I (for I could hear how they complained,) As sympathy impelled, Full oft to seek her presence did arise. And mine own soul (which better had refrained) So much my strength upheld That I could steadily behold her eyes. This in thy knowledge lies, Who then didst call me with so mild a face That I hoped solace from my greater load: And when she turned the key on my dark place, Such ruth thy grace bestowed Upon my grief, and in such piteous kind, That I had strength to bear, and was resign'd. For love of the sweet favour's comforting Did I become her thrall; And still her every movement gladdened me With triumph that I served so sweet a thing: Pleasures and blessings all I set aside, my perfect hope to see: Till her proud contumely— That so mine aim might rest unsatisfied— Covered the beauty of her countenance. So straightway fell into my living side, To slay me, the swift lance: While she rejoiced and watched my bitter end, Only to prove what succour thou wouldst send. I therefore, weary with my love's constraint, To death's deliverance ran, That out of terrible grief I might be brought: For tears had broken me and left me faint Beyond the lot of man, Until each sigh must be my last, I thought. Yet still this longing wrought So much of torment for my soul to bear, That with the pang I swooned and fell to earth. Then, as in trance, 'twas whispered at mine ear, How in this constant girth Of anguish, I indeed at length must die: So that I dreaded Love continually. Master, thou knowest now The life which in thy service I have borne: Not that I tell it thee to disallow Control, who still to thy behest am sworn. Yet if through this my vow I remain dead, nor help they will confer, Do thou at least, for God's sake, pardon her. VII Canzone He beseeches Death for the Life of Beatrice Death, since I find not one with whom to grieve, Nor whom this grief of mine may move to tears, Whereso I be or whitherso I turn: Since it is thou who in my soul wilt leave No single joy, but chill'st it with just fears And makest it in fruitless hopes to burn: Since thou, Death, and thou only, canst decern Wealth to my life, or want, at thy free choice:— It is to thee that I lift up my voice, Bowing my face that's like a face just dead. I come to thee, as to one pitying, In grief for that sweet rest which nought can bring Again, if thou but once be entered Into her life whom my heart cherishes Even as the only portal of its peace. Death, how most sweet the peace is that thy grace Can grant to me, and that I pray thee for, Thou easily mayst know by a sure sign, It in mine eyes thou look a little space And read in them the hidden dread they store,— If upon all thou look which proves me thine. Since the fear only maketh me to pine After this sort,—what will mine anguish be When her eyes close, of dreadful verity, In whose light is the light of mine own eyes? But now I know that thou wouldst have my life As hers, and joy'st thee in my fruitless strife. Yet I do think this which I feel implies That soon, when I would die to flee from pain, I shall find none by whom I may be slain. Death, if indeed thou smite this gentle one Whose outward worth but tells the intellect How wondrous is the miracle within,— Thou biddest Virtue rise up and begone, Thou dost away with Mercy's best effect, Thou spoil'st the mansion of God's sojourning. Yea, unto nought her beauty thou dost bring Which is above all other beauties, even In so much as befitteth one whom Heaven Sent upon earth in token of its own. Thou dost break through the perfect trust which hath Been alway her companion in Love's path: The light once darkened which was hers alone, Love needs must say to them he ruleth o'er, “I have lost the noble banner that I bore.” Death, have some pity then for all the ill Which cannot choose but happen if she die, And which will be the sorest ever known. Slacken the string, if so it be thy will, That the sharp arrow leave it not,—thereby Sparing her life, which if it flies is flown. O Death, for God's sake, be some pity shown! Restrain within thyself, even at its height, The cruel wrath which moveth thee to smite Her in whom God hath set so much of grace. Show now some ruth if 'tis a thing thou hast! I seem to see Heaven's gate, that is shut fast, Open, and angels filling all the space About me,—come to fetch her soul whose laud Is sung by saints and angels before God. Song, thou must surely see how fine a thread This is that my last hope is holden by, And what I should be brought to without her. Therefore for thy plain speech and lowlihead Make thou no pause: but go immediately, (Knowing thyself for my heart's minister,) And with that very meek and piteous air Thou hast, stand up before the face of Death, To wrench away the bar that prisoneth And win unto the place of the good fruit. And if indeed thou shake by thy soft voice Death's mortal purpose,—haste thee and rejoice Our lady with the issue of thy suit. So yet awhile our earthly nights and days Shall keep the blessed spirit that I praise. VIII Sonnet On the 9th of June 1290 Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me, Saying, “I've come to stay with thee a while;” And I perceived that she had ushered Bile And Pain into my house for company. Wherefore I said, “Go forth—away with thee!” But like a Greek she answered, full of guile, And went on arguing in an easy style. Then, looking, I saw Love come silently, Habited in black raiment, smooth and new, Having a black hat set upon his hair; And certainly the tears he shed were true. So that I asked, “What ails thee, trifler?” Answering he said: “A grief to be gone through; For our own lady's dying, brother dear.” IX TO CINO DA PISTOIA Sonnet He rebukes Cino for Fickleness I thought to be for ever separate, Fair Master Cino, from these rhymes of yours; Since further from the coast, another course, My vessel now must journey with her freight. This might seem to suggest that the present sonnet was written about the same time as the close of the Vita Nuova, and that an allusion may also here be intended to the first conception of Dante's great work. Yet still, because I hear men name your state As his whom every lure doth straight beguile, I pray you lend a very little while Unto my voice your ear grown obdurate. The man after this measure amorous, Who still at his own will is bound and loosed, How slightly Love him wounds is lightly known. If on this wise your heart in homage bows, I pray you for God's sake it be disused, So that the deed and the sweet words be one. CINO DA PISTOIA TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He answers Dante, confessing his unsteadfast heart Dante, since I from my own native place In heavy exile have turned wanderer, Far distant from the purest joy which e'er Had issued from the Fount of joy and grace, I have gone weeping through the world's dull space, And me proud Death, as one too mean, doth spare; Yet meeting Love, Death's neighbour, I declare That still his arrows hold my heart in chase. Nor from his pitiless aim can I get free, Nor from the hope which comforts my weak will, Though no true aid exists which I could share. One pleasure ever binds and looses me; That so, by one same Beauty lured, I still Delight in many women here and there. X TO CINO DA PISTOIA Sonnet Written in Exile Because I find not whom to speak withal Anent that lord whose I am as thou art, Behoves that in thine ear I tell some part Of this whereof I gladly would say all. And deem thou nothing else occasional Of my long silence while I kept apart, Except this place, so guilty at the heart That the right has not who will give it stall. Love comes not here to any woman's face, Nor any man here for his sake will sigh, For unto such, “Thou fool!” were straightway said. Ah! Master Cino, how the time turns base, And mocks at us, and on our rhymes says “Fie!” Since truth has been thus thinly harvested. CINO DA PISTOIA TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He answers the foregoing Sonnet, and prays Dante, in the name of Beatrice, to continue his great Poem I know not, Dante, in what refuge dwells The truth, which with all men is out of mind; For long ago it left this place behind, Till in its stead at last God's thunder swells. Yet if our shifting life most clearly tells That here the truth has no reward assign'd,— 'Twas God, remember, taught it to mankind, And even among the fiends preached nothing else. Then, though the kingdoms of the earth be torn, Where'er thou set thy feet, from Truth's control, Yet unto me thy friend this prayer accord:— Beloved, O my brother, sorrow-worn, Even in that lady's name who is thy goal, Sing on till thou redeem thy plighted word! That is, the pledge given at the end of the Vita Nuova. This may perhaps have been written in the early days of Dante's exile, before his resumption of the interrupted Commedia. XI Sonnet Of Beauty and Duty Two ladies to the summit of my mind Have clomb, to hold an argument of love. The one has wisdom with her from above, For every noblest virtue well designed: The other, beauty's tempting power refined And the high charm of perfect grace approve: And I, as my sweet Master's will doth move, At feet of both their favours am reclined. Beauty and Duty in my soul keep strife, At question if the heart such course can take And 'twixt two ladies hold its love complete. The fount of gentle speech yields answer meet, That Beauty may be loved for gladness' sake, And Duty in the lofty ends of life. XII Sestina I have translated this piece both on account of its great and peculiar beauty, and also because it affords an example of a form of composition which I have met with in no Italian writer before Dante's time, though it is not uncommon among the Provencal poets (see Dante, De Vulg. Eloq.). I have headed it with the name of a Paduan lady, to whom it is surmised by some to have been addressed during Dante's exile; but this must be looked upon as a rather doubtful conjecture, and I have adopted the name chiefly to mark it at once as not referring to Beatrice. Of the Lady Pietra degli Scrovigni To the dim light and the large circle of shade I have clomb, and to the whitening of the hills, There where we see no colour in the grass. Nathless my longing loses not its green, It has so taken root in the hard stone Which talks and hears as though it were a lady. Utterly frozen is this youthful lady, Even as the snow that lies within the shade; For she is no more moved than is the stone By the sweet season which makes warm the hills And alters them afresh from white to green, Covering their sides again with flowers and grass. When on her hair she sets a crown of grass The thought has no more room for other lady; Because she weaves the yellow with the green So well that Love sits down there in the shade,— Love who has shut me in among low hills Faster than between walls of granite-stone. She is more bright than is a precious stone; The wound she gives may not be healed with grass: I therefore have fled far o'er plains and hills For refuge from so dangerous a lady; But from her sunshine nothing can give shade,— Not any hill, nor wall, nor summer-green. A while ago, I saw her dressed in green,— So fair, she might have wakened in a stone This love which I do feel even for her shade; And therefore, as one woos a graceful lady, I wooed her in a field that was all grass Girdled about with very lofty hills. Yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills Before Love's flame in this damp wood and green Burn, as it burns within a youthful lady, For my sake, who would sleep away in stone My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, Only to see her garments cast a shade. How dark soe'er the hills throw out their shade, Under her summer-green the beautiful lady Covers it, like a stone covered in grass. XIII Sonnet I have separated this sonnet from the pieces bearing on the Vita Nuova, as it is naturally repugnant to connect it with Beatrice. I cannot, however, but think it possible that it may have been the bitter fruit of some bitterest moment in those hours when Dante endured her scorn. A Curse for a fruitless Love My curse be on the day when first I saw The brightness in those treacherous eyes of thine,— The hour when from my heart thou cam'st to draw My soul away, that both might fail and pine: My curse be on the skill that smooth'd each line Of my vain songs,—the music and just law Of art, by which it was my dear design That the whole world should yield thee love and awe. Yea, let me curse mine own obduracy, Which firmly holds what doth itself confound— To wit, thy fair perverted face of scorn: For whose sake Love is oftentimes forsworn So that men mock at him: but most at me Who would hold fortune's wheel and turn it round. GUIDO CAVALCANTI I TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He interprets Dante's Dream, related in the first Sonnet of the Vita Nuova See the Vita Nuova, at page 312. Unto my thinking, thou beheld'st all worth, All joy, as much of good as man may know, If thou wert in his power who here below Is honour's righteous lord throughout this earth. Where evil dies, even there he has his birth, Whose justice out of pity's self doth grow. Softly to sleeping persons he will go, And, with no pain to them, their hearts draw forth. Thy heart he took, as knowing well, alas! That Death had claimed thy lady for a prey: In fear whereof, he fed her with thy heart. But when he seemed in sorrow to depart, Sweet was thy dream; for by that sign, I say, Surely the opposite shall come to pass. This may refer to the belief that, towards morning, dreams go by contraries. II Sonnet To his Lady Joan, of Florence Flowers hast thou in thyself, and foliage, And what is good, and what is glad to see; The sun is not so bright as thy visàge; All is stark naught when one hath looked on thee; There is not such a beautiful personage Anywhere on the green earth verily; If one fear love, thy bearing sweet and sage Comforteth him, and no more fear hath he. Thy lady friends and maidens ministering Are all, for love of thee, much to my taste: And much I pray them that in everything They honour thee even as thou meritest, And have thee in their gentle harbouring: Because among them all thou art the best. III Sonnet He compares all Things with his Lady, and finds them wanting Beauty in woman; the high will's decree; Fair knighthood armed for manly exercise; The pleasant song of birds; love's soft replies; The strength of rapid ships upon the sea; The serene air when light begins to be; The white snow, without wind that falls and lies; Fields of all flower; the place where waters rise; Silver and gold; azure in jewellery:— Weighed against these, the sweet and quiet worth Which my dear lady cherishes at heart Might seem a little matter to be shown; Being truly, over these, as much apart As the whole heaven is greater than this earth. All good to kindred natures cleaveth soon. IV Sonnet A Rapture concerning his Lady Who is she coming, whom all gaze upon, Who makes the air all tremulous with light, And at whose side is Love himself? that none Dare speak, but each man's sighs are infinite. Ah me! how she looks round from left to right, Let Love discourse: I may not speak thereon. Lady she seems of such high benison As makes all others graceless in men's sight. The honour which is hers cannot be said; To whom are subject all things virtuous, While all things beauteous own her deity. Ne'er was the mind of man so nobly led, Nor yet was such redemption granted us That we should ever know her perfectly. V Ballata Of his Lady among other Ladies With other women I beheld my love;— Not that the rest were women to mine eyes, Who only as her shadows seemed to move. I do not praise her more than with the truth, Nor blame I these if it be rightly read. But while I speak, a thought I may not soothe Says to my senses: “Soon shall ye be dead, If for my sake your tears ye will not shed.” And then the eyes yield passage, at that thought, To the heart's weeping, which forgets her not. VI TO GUIDO ORLANDI Sonnet Of a consecrated Image resembling his Lady Guido, an image of my lady dwells At San Michele in Orto, consecrate And duly worshipped. Fair in holy state She listens to the tale each sinner tells: And among them that come to her, who ails The most, on him the most doth blessing wait. She bids the fiend men's bodies abdicate; Over the curse of blindness she prevails, And heals sick languors in the public squares. A multitude adores her reverently: Before her face two burning tapers are; Her voice is uttered upon paths afar. Yet through the Lesser Brethren's The Franciscans, in profession of deeper poverty and humility than belonged to other Orders, called themselves Fratres minores. jealousy She is named idol; not being one of theirs. GUIDO ORLANDI TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Madrigal In answer to the foregoing Sonnet If thou hadst offered, friend, to blessed Mary A pious voluntary, As thus: “Fair rose, in holy garden set”: Thou then hadst found a true similitude: Because all truth and good Are hers, who was the mansion and the gate Wherein abode our High Salvation, Conceived in her, a Son, Even by the angel's greeting whom she met. Be thou assured that if one cry to her, Confessing, “I did err,” For death she gives him life; for she is great. Ah! how mayst thou be counselled to implead With God thine own misdeed, And not another's? Ponder what thou art; And humbly lay to heart That Publican who wept his proper need. The Lesser Brethren cherish the divine Scripture and church-doctrine; Being appointed keepers of the faith Whose preaching succoureth: For what they preach is our best medicine. VII Sonnet Of the Eyes of a certain Mandetta, of Thoulouse, which resemble those of his Lady Joan, of Florence A certain youthful lady in Thoulouse, Gentle and fair, of cheerful modesty, Is in her eyes, with such exact degree, Of likeness unto mine own lady, whose I am, that through the heart she doth abuse The soul to sweet desire. It goes from me To her; yet, fearing, saith not who is she That of a truth its essence thus subdues. This lady looks on it with the sweet eyes Whose glance did erst the wounds of Love anoint Through its true lady's eyes which are as they. Then to the heart returns it, full of sighs, Wounded to death by a sharp arrow's point Wherewith this lady speeds it on its way. VIII Ballata He reveals, in a Dialogue, his increasing Love for Mandetta Being in thought of love, I chanced to see Two youthful damozels. One sang: “Our life inhales All love continually.” Their aspect was so utterly serene, So courteous, of such quiet nobleness, That I said to them: “Yours, I may well ween, 'Tis of all virtue to unlock the place. Ah! damozels, do not account him base Whom thus his wound subdues: Since I was at Thoulouse, My heart is dead in me.” They turned their eyes upon me in so much As to perceive how wounded was my heart; While, of the spirits born of tears, one such Had been begotten through the constant smart. Then seeing me, abashed, to turn apart, One of them said, and laugh'd: “Love, look you, by his craft Holds this man thoroughly.” But with grave sweetness, after a brief while, She who at first had laughed on me replied, Saying: “This lady, who by Love's great guile Her countenance in thy heart has glorified, Look'd thee so deep within the eyes, Love sigh'd And was awakened there. If it seem ill to bear, In him thy hope must be.” The second piteous maiden, of all ruth, Fashioned for sport in Love's own image, said: “This stroke, whereof thy heart bears trace in sooth, From eyes of too much puïssance was shed, Whence in thy heart such brightness enterèd, Thou mayst not look thereon. Say, of those eyes that shone Canst thou remember thee?” Then said I, yielding answer therewithal Unto this virgin's difficult behest: “A lady of Thoulouse, whom Love doth call Mandetta, sweetly kirtled and enlac'd, I do remember to my sore unrest. Yea, by her eyes indeed My life has been decreed To death inevitably.” Go, Ballad, to the city, even Thoulouse, And softly entering the Daurade, The ancient church of the Daurade still exists at Thoulouse. It was so called from the golden effect of the mosaics adorning it. look round And softly call, that so there may be found Some lady who for compleasaunce may choose To show thee her who can my life confuse. And if she yield thee way, Lift thou thy voice and say: “For grace I come to thee.” DANTE ALIGHIERI TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Sonnet He imagines a pleasant Voyage for Guido, Lapo Gianni, and himself, with their three Ladies Guido, I wish that Lapo, thou, and I, Could be by spells conveyed, as it were now, Upon a barque, with all the winds that blow Across all seas at our good will to hie. So no mischance nor temper of the sky Should mar our course with spite or cruel slip; But we, observing old companionship, To be companions still should long thereby. And Lady Joan, and Lady Beatrice, And her the thirtieth on my roll, That is, his list of the sixty most beautiful ladies of Florence, referred to in the Vita Nuova; among whom Lapo Gianni's lady, Lagia, would seem to have stood thirtieth. with us Should our good wizard set, o'er seas to move And not to talk of anything but love: And they three ever to be well at ease, As we should be, I think, if this were thus. IX TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet Guido answers the foregoing Sonnet, speaking with shame of his changed Love If I were still that man, worthy to love, Of whom I have but the remembrance now, Or if the lady bore another brow, To hear this thing might bring me joy thereof. But thou, who in Love's proper court dost move, Even there where hope is born of grace,—see how My very soul within me is brought low: For a swift archer, whom his feats approve, Now bends the bow, which Love to him did yield, In such mere sport against me, it would seem As though he held his lordship for a jest. Then hear the marvel which is sorriest:— My sorely wounded soul forgiveth him, Yet knows that in his act her strength is kill'd. X TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He reports, in a feigned Vision, the successful Issue of Lapo Gianni's Love Dante, a sigh that rose from the heart's core Assailed me, while I slumbered, suddenly: So that I woke o'the instant, fearing sore Lest it came thither in Love's company: Till, turning, I beheld the servitor Of Lady Lagia: “Help me,” so said he, “O help me, Pity.” Though he said no more, So much of Pity's essence entered me, That I was ware of Love, those shafts he wields A-whetting, and preferred the mourner's quest To him, who straightway answered on this wise: “Go tell my servant that the lady yields, And that I hold her now at his behest: If he believe not, let him note her eyes.” XI TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He mistrusts the Love of Lapo Gianni I pray thee, Dante, shouldst thou meet with Love In any place where Lapo then may be, That there thou fail not to mark heedfully If Love with lover's name that man approve; If to our Master's will his lady move Aright, and if himself show fealty: For ofttimes, by ill custom, ye may see This sort profess the semblance of true love. Thou know'st that in the court where Love holds sway A law subsists, that no man who is vile Can service yield to a lost woman there. If suffering aught avail the sufferer, Thou straightway shalt discern our lofty style, Which needs the badge of honour must display. XII Sonnet On the Detection of a false Friend I should think, from the mention of Lady Lagia, that this might refer again to Lapo Gianni, who seems (one knows not why) to have fallen into disgrace with his friends. The Guido mentioned is probably Guido Orlandi. Love and the Lady Lagia, Guido and I, Unto a certain lord are bounden all, Who has released us—know ye from whose thrall? Yet I'll not speak, but let the matter die: Since now these three no more are held thereby, Who in such homage at his feet did fall That I myself was not more whimsical, In him conceiving godship from on high. Let Love be thanked the first, who first discern'd The truth; and that wise lady afterward, Who in fit time took back her heart again; And Guido next, from worship wholly turn'd; And I, as he. But if ye have not heard, I shall not tell how much I loved him then. XIII Sonnet He speaks of a third Love of his O thou that often hast within thine eyes A Love who holds three shafts,—know thou from me That this my sonnet would commend to thee (Come from afar) a soul in heavy sighs, Which even by Love's sharp arrow wounded lies. Twice did the Syrian archer shoot, and he Now bends his bow the third time, cunningly, That, thou being here, he wound me in no wise. Because the soul would quicken at the core Thereby, which now is near to utter death, From those two shafts, a triple wound that yield The first gives pleasure, yet disquieteth; And with the second is the longing for The mighty gladness by the third fulfill'd. XIV Ballata Of a continual Death in Love Though thou, indeed, hast quite forgotten ruth, Its steadfast truth my heart abandons not; But still its thought yields service in good part To that hard heart in thee. Alas! who hears believes not I am so. Yet who can know? of very surety, none. From Love is won a spirit, in some wise, Which dies perpetually: And, when at length in that strange ecstasy The heavy sigh will start, There rains upon my heart A love so pure and fine, That I say: “Lady, I am wholly thine.” I may take this opportunity of mentioning that, in every case where an abrupt change of metre occurs in one of my translations, it is so also in the original poem. XV Sonnet To a Friend who does not pity his Love If I entreat this lady that all grace Seem not unto her heart an enemy, Foolish and evil thou declarest me, And desperate in idle stubbornness. Whence is such cruel judgment thine, whose face, To him that looks thereon, professeth thee Faithful, and wise, and of all courtesy, And made after the way of gentleness? Alas! my soul within my heart doth find Sighs, and its grief by weeping doth enhance, That, drowned in bitter tears, those sighs depart: And then there seems a presence in the mind, As of a lady's thoughtful countenance Come to behold the death of the poor heart. XVI Ballata He perceives that his highest Love is gone from him Through this my strong and new misaventure, All now is lost to me Which most was sweet in Love's supremacy. So much of life is dead in its control, That she, my pleasant lady of all grace, Is gone out of the devastated soul: I see her not, nor do I know her place; Nor even enough of virtue with me stays To understand, ah me! The flower of her exceeding purity. Because there comes—to kill that gentle thought With saying that I shall not see her more— This constant pain wherewith I am distraught, Which is a burning torment very sore, Wherein I know not whom I should implore. Thrice thanked the Master be Who turns the grinding wheel of misery! Full of great anquish in a place of fear The spirit of my heart lies sorrowing, Through Fortune's bitter craft. She lured it here, And gave it o'er to Death, and barbed the sting; She wrought that hope which was a treacherous thing; In Time, which dies from me, She made me lose mine hour of ecstasy. For you, perturbed and fearful words of mine, Whither yourselves may please, even thither go; But always burthened with shame's troublous sign, And on my lady's name still calling low. For me, I must abide in such deep woe That all who look shall see Death's shadow on my face assuredly. XVII Sonnet Of his Pain from a new Love Why from the danger did mine eyes not start,— Why not become even blind,—ere through my sight Within my soul thou ever couldst alight To say: “Dost thou not hear me in thy heart?” New torment then, the old torment's counterpart, Filled me at once with such a sore affright, That, Lady, lady, (I said,) destroy not quite Mine eyes and me! O help us where thou art! Thou hast so left mine eyes, that love is fain— Even Love himself—with pity uncontroll'd To bend above them, weeping for their loss: Saying: “If any man feel heavy pain, This man's more painful heart let him behold: Death has it in her hand, cut like a cross.” GUIDO ORLANDI TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Prolonged Sonnet He finds fault with the Conceits of the foregoing Sonnet Friend, well I know thou knowest well to bear Thy sword's-point, that it pierce the close-locked mail: And like a bird to flit from perch to pale: And out of difficult ways to find the air: Largely to take and generously to share: Thrice to secure advantage: to regale Greatly the great, and over lands prevail. In all thou art, one only fault is there: For still among the wise of wit thou say'st That Love himself doth weep for thine estate; And yet, no eyes no tears: lo now, thy whim! Soft, rather say: This is not held in haste; But bitter are the hours and passionate To him that loves, and love is not for him. For me, (by usage strengthened to forbear From carnal love,) I fall not in such snare. GIANNI ALFANI TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Sonnet From a passage in Ubaldini's Glossary (1640) to the “Documenti d'Amore” of Francesco Barberino (1300), I judge that Guido answered the above sonnet, and that Alfani made a rejoinder, from which a scrap there printed appears to be taken. The whole piece existed, in Ubaldini's time, among the Strozzi MSS. On the part of a Lady of Pisa Guido, that Gianni who, a day agone, Sought thee, now greets thee (ay and thou mayst laugh!) On that same Pisan beauty's sweet behalf Who can deal love-wounds even as thou hast done. She asked me whether thy good will were prone For service unto Love who troubles her, If she to thee in suchwise should repair That, save by him and Gualtier, 'twere not known:— For thus her kindred of ill augury Should lack the means wherefrom there might be plann'd Worse harm than lying speech that smites afar. I told her that thou hast continually A goodly sheaf of arrows to thy hand, Which well should stead her in such gentle war. BERNARDO DA BOLOGNA TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Sonnet He writes to Guido, telling him of the Love which a certain Pinella showed on seeing him Unto that lowly lovely maid, I wis, So poignant in the heart was thy salute, That she changed countenance, remaining mute. Wherefore I asked: “Pinella, how is this? Hast heard of Guido? know'st thou who he is?” She answered, “Yea;” then paused, irresolute; But I saw well how the love-wounds acute Were widened, and the star which Love calls his Filled her with gentle brightness perfectly. “But, friend, an't please thee, I would have it told,” She said, “how I am known to him through thee. Yet since, scarce seen, I knew his name of old,— Even as the riddle is read, so must it be. Oh! send him love of mine a thousand-fold!” XVIII TO BERNARDO DA BOLOGNA Sonnet Guido answers, commending Pinella, and saying that the Love he can offer her is already shared by many noble Ladies. The fountain-head that is so bright to see Gains as it runs in virtue and in sheen, Friend Bernard; and for her who spoke with thee, Even such the flow of her young life has been: So that when Love discourses secretly Of things the fairest he has ever seen, He says there is no fairer thing than she, A lowly maid as lovely as a queen. And for that I am troubled, thinking of That sigh wherein I burn upon the waves Which drift her heart,—poor barque, so ill bested!— Unto Pinella a great river of love I send, that's full of sirens, and whose slaves Are beautiful and richly habited. DINO COMPAGNI TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Sonnet He reproves Guido for his Arrogance in Love No man may mount upon a golden stair, Guido my master, to Love's palace-sill: No key of gold will fit the lock that's there, Nor heart there enter without pure goodwill. Not if he miss one courteous duty, dare A lover hope he should his love fulfil; But to his lady must make meek repair, Reaping with husbandry her favours still. And thou but know'st of Love (I think) his name: Youth holds thy reason in extremities: Only on thine own face thou turn'st thine eyes; Fairer than Absalom's account'st the same; And think'st, as rosy moths are drawn by flame, To draw the women from their balconies. It is curious to find these poets perpetually rating one another for the want of constancy in love. Guido is rebuked, as above, by Dino Compagni; Cino da Pistoia by Dante (p. 353); and Dante by Guido (p. 370), who formerly, as we have seen (p. 363), had confided to him his doubts of Lapo Gianni. XIX TO GUIDO ORLANDI Sonnet In praise of Guido Orlandi's Lady A lady in whom love is manifest— That love which perfect honour doth adorn— Hath ta'en the living heart out of thy breast, Which in her keeping to new life is born: For there by such sweet power it is possest As even is felt of Indian unicorn: In old representations, the unicorn is often seen with his head in a virgin's lap. And all its virtue now, with fierce unrest, Unto thy soul makes difficult return. For this thy lady is virtue's minister In suchwise that no fault there is to show, Save that God made her mortal on this ground. And even herein His wisdom shall be found: For only thus our intellect could know That heavenly beauty which resembles her. GUIDO ORLANDI TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Sonnet He answers the foregoing Sonnet, declaring himself his Lady's Champion To sound of trumpet rather than of horn, I in Love's name would hold a battle-play Of gentlemen in arms on Easter Day; And, sailing without oar or wind, be borne Unto my joyful beauty; all that morn To ride round her, in her cause seeking fray Of arms with all but thee, friend, who dost say The truth of her, and whom all truths adorn. And still I pray Our Lady's grace above, Most reverently, that she whom my thoughts bear In sweet remembrance own her Lord supreme. Holding her honour dear, as doth behove,— In God who therewithal sustaineth her Let her abide, and not depart from Him. XX TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He rebukes Dante for his way of Life, after the Death of Beatrice. This interesting sonnet must refer to the same period of Dante's life regarding which he has made Beatrice address him in words of noble reproach when he meets her in Eden. (Purg. C. xxx.) I come to thee by daytime constantly, But in thy thoughts too much of baseness find: Greatly it grieves me for thy gentle mind, And for thy many virtues gone from thee. It was thy wont to shun much company, Unto all sorry concourse ill inclin'd: And still thy speech of me, heartfelt and kind, Had made me treasure up thy poetry. But now I dare not, for thine abject life, Make manifest that I approve thy rhymes; Nor come I in such sort that thou mayst know. Ah! prythee read this sonnet many times: So shall that evil one who bred this strife Be thrust from thy dishonoured soul and go. XXI Ballata Concerning a Shepherd-maid Within a copse I met a shepherd-maid, More fair, I said, than any star to see. She came with waving tresses pale and bright, With rosy cheer, and loving eyes of flame, Guiding the lambs beneath her wand aright. Her naked feet still had the dews on them, As, singing like a lover, so she came; Joyful, and fashioned for all ecstasy. I greeted her at once, and question made What escort had she through the woods in spring. But with soft accents she replied and said That she was all alone there, wandering; Moreover: “Do you know, when the birds sing, My heart's desire is for a mate,” she said. While she was telling me this wish of hers, The birds were all in song throughout the wood. “Even now then,” said my thought, “the time recurs, With mine own longing to assuage her mood.” And so, in her sweet favour's name, I sued That she would kiss there and embrace with me. She took my hand to her with amorous will, And answered that she gave me all her heart, And drew me where the leaf is fresh and still, Where spring the wood-flowers in the shade apart. And on that day, by Joy's enchanted art, There Love in very presence seemed to be. The glossary to Barberino, already mentioned, refers to the existence, among the Strozzi MSS., of a poem by Lapo di Farinata degli Uberti, written in answer to the above ballata of Cavalcanti. As this respondent was no other than Guido's brother-in-law, one feels curious to know what he said to the peccadilloes of his sister's husband. But I fear the poem cannot yet have been published, as I have sought for it in vain at all my printed sources of information. XXII Sonnet Of an ill-favoured Lady Just look, Manetto, at that wry-mouthed minx; Merely take notice what a wretch it is; How well contrived in her deformities, How beastly favoured when she scowls and blinks. Why, with a hood on (if one only thinks) Or muffle of prim veils and scapularies,— And set together, on a day like this, Some pretty lady with the odious sphinx;— Why, then thy sins could hardly have such weight, Nor thou be so subdued from Love's attack, Nor so possessed in Melancholy's sway, But that perforce thy peril must be great Of laughing till the very heart-strings crack: Either thou'dst die, or thou must run away. XXIII TO POPE BONIFACE VIII Sonnet After the Pope's Interdict, when the great Houses were leaving Florence Nero, thus much for tidings in thine ear. They of the Buondelmonti quake with dread, Nor by all Florence may be comforted, Noting in thee the lion's ravenous cheer; Who more than any dragon giv'st them fear, In ancient evil stubbornly array'd; Neither by bridge nor bulwark to be stay'd, But only by King Pharaoh's sepulchre. O in what monstrous sin dost thou engage,— All these which are of loftiest blood to drive Away, that none dare pause but all take wing! Yet sooth it is, thou might'st redeem the pledge Even yet, and save thy naked soul alive, Wert thou but patient in the bargaining. XXIV Ballata In Exile at Sarzana Because I think not ever to return, Ballad, to Tuscany,— Go therefore thou for me Straight to my lady's face, Who, of her noble grace, Shall show thee courtesy. Thou seekest her in charge of many sighs, Full of much grief and of exceeding fear. But have good heed thou come not to the eyes Of such as are sworn foes to gentle cheer: For, certes, if this thing should chance,—from her Thou then couldst only look For scorn, and such rebuke As needs must bring me pain;— Yea, after death again Tears and fresh agony. Surely thou knowest, Ballad, how that Death Assails me, till my life is almost sped: Thou knowest how my heart still travaileth Through the sore pangs which in my soul are bred:— My body being now so nearly dead, It cannot suffer more. Then, going, I implore That this my soul thou take (Nay, do so for my sake,) When my heart sets it free. Ah! Ballad, unto thy dear offices I do commend my soul, thus trembling; That thou mayst lead it, for pure piteousness, Even to that lady's presence whom I sing. Ah! Ballad, say thou to her, sorrowing, Whereso thou meet her then:— “This thy poor handmaiden Is come, nor will be gone, Being parted now from one Who served Love painfully.” Thou also, thou bewildered voice and weak, That goest forth in tears from my grieved heart, Shalt, with my soul and with this ballad, speak Of my dead mind, when thou dost hence depart, Unto that lady (piteous as thou art!) Who is so calm and bright, It shall be deep delight To feel her presence there. And thou, Soul, worship her Still in her purity. XXV Canzone This and the three following Canzoni are only to be found in the later collections of Guido Cavalcanti's poems. I have included them on account of their interest, if really his, and especially for the beauty of the last among them; but must confess to some doubts of their authenticity. A Song of Fortune Lo! I am she who makes the wheel to turn; Lo! I am she who gives and takes away; Blamed idly, day by day, In all mine acts by you, ye humankind: For whoso smites his visage and doth mourn, What time he renders back my gifts to me, Learns then that I decree No state which mine own arrows may not find. Who clomb must fall:—this bear ye well in mind, Nor say, because he fell, I did him wrong. Yet mine is a vain song: For truly ye may find out wisdom when King Arthur's resting-place is found of men. Ye make great marvel and astonishment What time ye see the sluggard lifted up And the just man to drop, And ye complain on God and on my sway. O humankind, ye sin in your complaint: For He, that Lord who made the world to live, Lets me not take or give By mine own act, but as He wills I may. Yet is the mind of man so castaway, That it discerns not the supreme behest. Alas! ye wretchedest, And chide ye at God also? Shall not He Judge between good and evil righteously? Ah! had ye knowledge how God evermore, With agonies of soul and grievous heats, As on an anvil beats On them that in this earth hold high estate,— Ye would choose little rather than much store, And solitude than spacious palaces; Such is the sore disease Of anguish that on all their days doth wait. Behold if they be not unfortunate, When oft the father dares not trust the son! O wealth, with thee is won A worm to gnaw for ever on his soul Whose abject life is laid in thy control! If also ye take note what piteous death They ofttimes make, whose hoards were manifold, Who cities had and gold And multitudes of men beneath their hand; Then he among you that most angereth Shall bless me, saying, “Lo! I worship thee That I was not as he Whose death is thus accurst throughout the land.” But now your living souls are held in band Of avarice, shutting you from the true light Which shows how sad and slight Are this world's treasured riches and array That still change hands a hundred times a-day. For me,—could envy enter in my sphere, Which of all human taint is clean and quit,— I well might harbour it When I behold the peasant at his toil. Guiding his team, untroubled, free from fear, He leaves his perfect furrow as he goes, And gives his field repose From thorns and tares and weeds that vex the soil: Thereto he labours, and without turmoil Entrusts his work to God, content if so Such guerdon from it grow That in that year his family shall live: Nor care nor thought to other things will give. But now ye may no more have speech of me, For this mine office craves continual use: Ye therefore deeply muse Upon those things which ye have heard the while: Yea, and even yet remember heedfully How this my wheel a motion hath so fleet, That in an eyelid's beat Him whom it raised it maketh low and vile. None was, nor is, nor shall be of such guile, Who could, or can, or shall, I say, at length Prevail against my strength. But still those men that are my questioners In bitter torment own their hearts perverse. Song, that wast made to carry high intent Dissembled in the garb of humbleness,— With fair and open face To Master Thomas let thy course be bent. Say that a great thing scarcely may be pent In little room: yet always pray that he Commend us, thee and me, To them that are more apt in lofty speech: For truly one must learn ere he can teach. XXVI Canzone A Song against Poverty O poverty, by thee the soul is wrapp'd With hate, with envy, dolefulness, and doubt. Even so be thou cast out, And even so he that speaks thee otherwise. I name thee now, because my mood is apt To curse thee, bride of every lost estate, Through whom are desolate On earth all honourable things and wise. Within thy power each blest condition dies: By thee, men's minds with sore mistrust are made Fantastic and afraid:— Thou, hated worse than Death, by just accord, And with the loathing of all hearts abhorr'd. Yea, rightly art thou hated worse than Death, For he at length is longed for in the breast. But not with thee, wild beast, Was ever aught found beautiful or good. For life is all that man can lose by death, Not fame and the fair summits of applause; His glory shall not pause, But live in men's perpetual gratitude. While he who on thy naked sill has stood, Though of great heart and worthy everso, He shall be counted low. Then let the man thou troublest never hope To spread his wings in any lofty scope. Hereby my mind is laden with a fear, And I will take some thought to shelter me. For this I plainly see:— Through thee, to fraud the honest man is led; To tyranny the just lord turneth here, And the magnanimous soul to avarice. Of every bitter vice Thou, to my thinking, art the fount and head; From thee no light in any wise is shed, Who bringest to the paths of dusky hell. I therefore see full well, That death, the dungeon, sickness, and old age, Weighed against thee, are blessèd heritage. And what though many a goodly hypocrite, Lifting to thee his veritable prayer, Call God to witness there How this thy burden moved not Him to wrath. Why, who may call (of them that muse aright) Him poor, who of the whole can say, 'Tis Mine? Methinks I well divine That want, to such, should seem an easy path. God, who made all things, all things had and hath; Nor any tongue may say that He was poor, What while He did endure For man's best succour among men to dwell: Since to have all, with Him, was possible. Song, thou shalt wend upon thy journey now: And, if thou meet with folk who rail at thee, Saying that poverty Is not even sharper than thy words allow,— Unto such brawlers briefly answer thou, To tell them they are hypocrites; and then Say mildly, once again, That I, who am nearly in a beggar's case, Might not presume to sing my proper praise. XXVII Canzone He laments the Presumption and Incontinence of his Youth The devastating flame of that fierce plague, The foe of virtue, fed with others' peace More than itself foresees, Being still shut in to gnaw its own desire; Its strength not weakened, nor its hues more vague, For all the benison that virtue sheds, But which for ever spreads To be a living curse that shall not tire: Or yet again, that other idle fire Which flickers with all change as winds may please: One whichsoe'er of these At length has hidden the true path from me Which twice man may not see, And quenched the intelligence of joy, till now All solace but abides in perfect woe. Alas! the more my painful spirit grieves, The more confused with miserable strife Is that delicious life Which sighing it recalls perpetually: But its worst anguish, whence it still receives More pain than death, is sent, to yield the sting Of perfect suffering, By him who is my lord and governs me; Who holds all gracious truth in fealty, Being nursed in those four sisters' fond caress Through whom comes happiness. He now has left me; and I draw my breath Wound in the arms of Death, Desirous of her: she is cried upon In all the prayers my heart puts up alone. How fierce aforetime and how absolute That wheel of flame which turned within my head, May never quite be said, Because there are not words to speak the whole. It slew my hope whereof I lack the fruit, And stung the blood within my living flesh, To be an intricate mesh Of pain beyond endurance or control; Withdrawing me from God, who gave my soul To know the sign where honour has its seat From honour's counterfeit. So in its longing my heart finds not hope, Nor knows what door to ope; Since, parting me from God, this foe took thought To shut those paths wherein He may be sought. My second enemy, thrice armed in guile, As wise and cunning to mine overthrow As her smooth face doth show, With yet more shameless strength holds mastery. My spirit, naked of its light and vile, Is lit by her with her own deadly gleam, Which makes all anguish seem As nothing to her scourges that I see. O thou the body of grace, abide with me As thou wast once in the once joyful time; And though thou hate my crime, Fill not my life with torture to the end; But in thy mercy, bend My steps, and for thine honour, back again; Till, finding joy through thee, I bless my pain. Since that first frantic devil without faith Fell, in thy name, upon the stairs that mount Unto the limpid fount Of thine intelligence,—withhold not now Thy grace, nor spare my second foe from death. For lo! on this my soul has set her trust; And failing this, thou must Prove false to truth and honour, seest thou! Then, saving light and throne of strength, allow My prayer, and vanquish both my foes at last; That so I be not cast Into that woe wherein I fear to end. Yet if it is ordain'd That I must die ere this be perfected,— Ah! yield me comfort after I am dead. Ye unadornèd words obscure of sense, With weeping and with sighing go from me, And bear mine agony (Not to be told by words, being too intense,) To His intelligence Who moved by virtue shall fulfil my breath In human life or compensating death. XXVIII Canzone A Dispute with Death “O sluggish, hard, ingrate, what doest thou? Poor sinner, folded round with heavy sin, Whose life to find out joy alone is bent. I call thee, and thou fall'st to deafness now; And, deeming that my path whereby to win Thy seat is lost, there sitt'st thee down content, And hold'st me to thy will subservient. But I into thy heart have crept disguised: Among thy senses and thy sins I went, By roads thou didst not guess, unrecognised. Tears will not now suffice to bid me go, Nor countenance abased, nor words of woe.” DANTE AND HIS CIRCLE Now, when I heard the sudden dreadful voice Wake thus within to cruel utterance, Whereby the very heart of hearts did fail, My spirit might not any more rejoice, But fell from its courageous pride at once, And turned to fly, where flight may not avail. Then slowly 'gan some strength to re-inhale The trembling life which heard that whisper speak, And had conceived the sense with sore travail; Till in the mouth it murmured, very weak, Saying: “Youth, wealth, and beauty, these have I: O Death! remit thy claim,—I would not die.” Small sign of pity in that aspect dwells Which then had scattered all my life abroad Till there was comfort with no single sense: And yet almost in piteous syllables, When I had ceased to speak, this answer flow'd: “Behold what path is spread before thee hence; Thy life has all but a day's permanence. And is it for the sake of youth there seems In loss of human years such sore offence? Nay, look unto the end of youthful dreams. What present glory does thy hope possess, That shall not yield ashes and bitterness?” But, when I looked on Death made visible, From my heart's sojourn brought before mine eyes, And holding in her hand my grievous sin, I seemed to see my countenance, that fell, Shake like a shadow: my heart uttered cries, And my soul wept the curse that lay therein. Then Death: “Thus much thine urgent prayer shall win:— I grant thee the brief interval of youth At natural pity's strong soliciting.” And I (because I knew that moment's ruth But left my life to groan for a frail space) Fell in the dust upon my weeping face. So, when she saw me thus abashed and dumb, In loftier words she weighed her argument, That new and strange it was to hear her speak; Saying: “The path thy fears withhold thee from Is thy best path. To folly be not shent, Nor shrink from me because thy flesh is weak, Thou seest how man is sore confused, and eke How ruinous Chance makes havoc of his life, And grief is in the joys that he doth seek; Nor ever pauses the perpetual strife 'Twixt fear and rage; until beneath the sun His perfect anguish be fulfilled and done.” “O Death! thou art so dark and difficult, That never human creature might attain By his own will to pierce thy secret sense; Because, foreshadowing thy dread result, He may not put his trust in heart or brain, Nor power avails him, nor intelligence. Behold how cruelly thou takest hence These forms so beautiful and dignified, And chain'st them in thy shadow chill and dense, And forcest them in narrow graves to hide; With pitiless hate subduing still to thee The strength of man and woman's delicacy.” “Not for thy fear the less I come at last, For this thy tremor, for thy painful sweat. Take therefore thought to leave (for lo! I call) Kinsfolk and comrades, all thou didst hold fast,— Thy father and thy mother,—to forget All these thy brethren, sisters, children, all. Cast sight and hearing from thee; let hope fall; Leave every sense and thy whole intellect, These things wherein thy life made festival: For I have wrought thee to such strange effect That thou hast no more power to dwell with these As living man. Let pass thy soul in peace.” Yea, Lord. O thou, the Builder of the spheres, Who, making me, didst shape me, of thy grace, In thine own image and high counterpart; Do thou subdue my spirit, long perverse, To weep within thy will a certain space, Ere yet thy thunder come to rive my heart. Set in my hand some sign of what thou art, Lord God, and suffer me to seek out Christ,— Weeping, to seek Him in thy ways apart; Until my sorrow have at length suffic'd In some accepted instant to atone For sins of thought, for stubborn evil done. Dishevelled and in tears, go, song of mine, To break the hardness of the heart of man: Say how his life began From dust, and in that dust doth sink supine: Yet, say, the unerring spirit of grief shall guide His soul, being purified, To seek its Maker at the heavenly shrine. CINO DA PISTOIA I TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He interprets Dante's Dream, related in the first Sonnet of the Vita Nuova See ante, page 312. Each lover's longing leads him naturally Unto his lady's heart his heart to show; And this it is that Love would have thee know By the strange vision which he sent to thee. With thy heart therefore, flaming outwardly, In humble guise he fed thy lady so, Who long had lain in slumber, from all woe Folded within a mantle silently. Also, in coming, Love might not repress His joy, to yield thee thy desire achieved, Whence heart should unto heart true service bring. But understanding the great love-sickness Which in thy lady's bosom was conceived, He pitied her, and wept in vanishing. II TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Canzone On the Death of Beatrice Portinari Albeit my prayers have not so long delay'd, But craved for thee, ere this, that Pity and Love Which only bring our heavy life some rest; Yet is not now the time so much o'erstay'd But that these words of mine which tow'rds thee move Must find thee still with spirit dispossess'd, And say to thee: “In Heaven she now is bless'd, Even as the blessèd name men called her by;” While thou dost ever cry, “Alas! the blessing of mine eyes is flown!” Behold, these words set down Are needed still, for still thou sorrowest. Then hearken; I would yield advisedly Some comfort: Stay these sighs; give ear to me. We know for certain that in this blind world Each man's subsistence is of grief and pain, Still trailed by fortune through all bitterness. Blessèd the soul which, when its flesh is furl'd Within a shroud, rejoicing doth attain To Heaven itself, made free of earthly stress. Then wherefore sighs thy heart in abjectness, Which for her triumph should exult aloud? For He the Lord our God Hath called her, hearkening what her Angel said, To have Heaven perfected. Each saint for a new thing beholds her face, And she the face of our Redemption sees, Conversing with immortal substances. Why now do pangs of torment clutch thy heart Which with thy love should make thee overjoy'd, As him whose intellect hath passed the skies? Behold, the spirits of thy life depart Daily to Heaven with her, they so are buoy'd With their desire, and Love so bids them rise. O God! and thou, a man whom God made wise, To nurse a charge of care, and love the same! I bid thee in His Name From sin of sighing grief to hold thy breath, Nor let thy heart to death, Nor harbour death's resemblance in thine eyes. God hath her with Himself eternally, Yet she inhabits every hour with thee. Be comforted, Love cries, be comforted! Devotion pleads, Peace, for the love of God! O yield thyself to prayers so full of grace; And make thee naked now of this dull weed Which 'neath thy foot were better to be trod; For man through grief despairs and ends his days. How ever shouldst thou see the lovely face If any desperate death should once be thine? From justice so condign Withdraw thyself even now; that in the end Thy heart may not offend Against thy soul, which in the holy place, In Heaven, still hopes to see her and to be Within her arms. Let this hope comfort thee. Look thou into the pleasure wherein dwells Thy lovely lady who is in Heaven crown'd, Who is herself thy hope in Heaven, the while To make thy memory hallowed she avails; Being a soul within the deep Heaven bound, A face on thy heart painted, to beguile Thy heart of grief which else should turn it vile. Even as she seemed a wonder here below, On high she seemeth so,— Yea, better known, is there more wondrous yet. And even as she was met First by the angels with sweet song and smile, Thy spirit bears her back upon the wing, Which often in those ways is journeying. Of thee she entertains the blessèd throngs, And says to them: “While yet my body thrave On earth, I gat much honour which he gave, Commending me in his commended songs.” Also she asks alway of God our Lord To give thee peace according to His word. III TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He conceives of some Compensation in Death Among Dante's Epistles there is a Latin letter to Cino, whch I should judge was written in reply to this Sonnet. Dante, whenever this thing happeneth,— That Love's desire is quite bereft of Hope, (Seeking in vain at ladies' eyes some scope Of joy, through what the heart for ever saith,)— I ask thee, can amends be made by Death? Is such sad pass the last extremity?— Or may the Soul that never feared to die Then in another body draw new breath? Lo! thus it is through her who governs all Below,—that I, who entered at her door, Now at her dreadful window must fare forth. Yea, and I think through her it doth befall That even ere yet the road is travelled o'er My bones are weary and life is nothing worth. IV Madrigal To his Lady Selvaggia Vergiolesi; likening his Love to a Search for Gold I am all bent to glean the golden ore Little by little from the river-bed; Hoping the day to see When Crœsus shall be conquered in my store. Therefore, still sifting where the sands are spread, I labour patiently: Till, thus intent on this thing and no more,— If to a vein of silver I were led, It scarce could gladden me. And, seeing that no joy's so warm i'the core As this whereby the heart is comforted And the desire set free,— Therefore thy bitter love is still my scope, Lady, from whom it is my life's sore theme More painfully to sift the grains of hope Than gold out of that stream. V Sonnet To Love, in great Bitterness O love, O thou that, for my fealty, Only in torment dost thy power employ, Give me, for God's sake, something of thy joy, That I may learn what good there is in thee. Yea, for, if thou art glad with grieving me, Surely my very life thou shalt destroy When thou renew'st my pain, because the joy Must then be wept for with the misery. He that had never sense of good, nor sight, Esteems his ill estate but natural, Which so is lightlier borne: his case is mine. But, if thou wouldst uplift me for a sign, Bidding me drain the curse and know it all, I must a little taste its opposite. VI Sonnet Death is not without but within him This fairest lady, who, as well I wot, Found entrance by her beauty to my soul, Pierced through mine eyes my heart, which erst was whole, Sorely, yet makes as though she knew it not; Nay turns upon me now, to anger wrought; Dealing me harshness for my pain's best dole, And is so changed by her own wrath's control, That I go thence, in my distracted thought Content to die; and, mourning, cry abroad On Death, as upon one afar from me; But Death makes answer from within my heart. Then, hearing her so hard at hand to be, I do commend my spirit unto God; Saying to her too, “Ease and peace thou art.” VII Sonnet A Trance of Love Vanquished and weary was my soul in me, And my heart gasped after its much lament, When sleep at length the painful languor sent. And, as I slept (and wept incessantly),— Through the keen fixedness of memory Which I had cherished ere my tears were spent, I passed to a new trance of wonderment; Wherein a visible spirit I could see, Which caught me up, and bore me to a place Where my most gentle lady was alone; And still before us a fire seemed to move, Out of the which methought there came a moan Uttering, “Grace, a little season, grace! I am of one that hath the wings of Love.” VIII Sonnet Of the Grave of Selvaggia, on the Monte della Sambuca I was upon the high and blessed mound, And kissed, long worshipping, the stones and grass, There on the hard stones prostrate, where, alas! That pure one laid her forehead in the ground. Then were the springs of gladness sealed and bound, The day that unto Death's most bitter pass My sick heart's lady turned her feet, who was Already in her gracious life renown'd. So in that place I spake to Love, and cried: “O sweet my god, I am one whom Death may claim Hence to be his; for lo! my heart lies here.” Anon, because my Master lent no ear, Departing, still I called Selvaggia's name. So with my moan I left the mountain-side. IX Canzone His Lament for Selvaggia Ay me, alas! the beautiful bright hair That shed reflected gold O'er the green growths on either side the way: Ay me! the lovely look, open and fair, Which my heart's core doth hold With all else of that best-remembered day; Ay me! the face made gay With joy that Love confers; Ay me! that smile of hers Where whiteness as of snow was visible Among the roses at all seasons red! Ay me! and was this well, O Death, to let me live when she is dead? Ay me! the calm, erect, dignified walk; Ay me! the sweet salute,— The thoughtful mind,—the wit discreetly worn; Ay me! the clearness of her noble talk, Which made the good take root In me, and for the evil woke my scorn; Ay me! the longing born Of so much loveliness,— The hope, whose eager stress Made other hopes fall back to let it pass, Even till my load of love grew light thereby! These thou hast broken, as glass, O Death, who makest me, alive, to die! Ay me! Lady, the lady of all worth;— Saint, for whose single shrine All other shrines I left, even as Love will'd;— Ay me! what precious stone in the whole earth, For that pure fame of thine Worthy the marble statue's base to yield? Ay me! fair vase fulfill'd With more than this world's good,— By cruel chance and rude Cast out upon the steep path of the mountains Where Death has shut thee in between hard stones! Ay me! two languid fountains Of weeping are these eyes, which joy disowns. Ay me! sharp Death! till what I ask is done And my whole life is ended utterly,— Answer—must I weep on Even thus, and never cease to moan Ay me? X TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI Sonnet He owes nothing to Guido as a Poet What rhymes are thine which I have ta'en from thee, Thou Guido, that thou ever say'st I thieve? I have not examined Cino's poetry with special reference to this accusation; but there is a Canzone of his in which he speaks of having conceived an affection for another lady from her resemblance to Selvaggia. Perhaps Guido considered this as a sort of plagiarism de facto on his own change of love through Mandetta's likeness to Giovanna. 'Tis true, fine fancies gladly I receive, But when was aught found beautiful in thee? Nay, I have searched my pages diligently, And tell the truth, and lie not, by your leave. From whose rich store my web of songs I weave Love knoweth well, well knowing them and me. No artist I,—all men may gather it; Nor do I work in ignorance of pride, (Though the world reach alone the coarser sense;) But am a certain man of humble wit Who journeys with his sorrow at his side, For a heart's sake, alas! that is gone hence. XI Sonnet He impugns the verdicts of Dante's Commedia This book of Dante's, very sooth to say, Is just a poet's lovely heresy, Which by a lure as sweet as sweet can be Draws other men's concerns beneath its sway; While, among stars' and comets' dazzling play, It beats the right down, lets the wrong go free, Shows some abased, and others in great glee, Much as with lovers is Love's ancient way. Therefore his vain decrees, wherein he lied, Fixing folks' nearness to the Fiend their foe, Must be like empty nutshells flung aside. Yet through the rash false witness set to grow, French and Italian vengeance on such pride May fall, like Antony's on Cicero. XII Sonnet He condemns Dante for not naming, in the Commedia, his friend Onesto di Boncima, and his Lady Selvaggia Among the faults we in that book descry Which has crowned Dante lord of rhyme and thought, Are two so grave that some attaint is brought Unto the greatness of his soul thereby. One is, that holding with Sordello high Discourse, and with the rest who sang and taught, He of Onesto di Boncima Between this poet and Cino various friendly sonnets were interchanged, which may be found in the Italian collections. There is also one sonnet by Onesto to Cino, with his answer, both of which are far from being affectionate or respectful. They are very obscure, however, and not specially interesting. nought Has said, who was to Arnauld Daniel The Provencal poet, mentioned in C. xxvi of the Purgatory. nigh. The other is, that when he says he came To see, at summit of the sacred stair, His Beatrice among the heavenly signs,— He, looking in the bosom of Abraham, Saw not that highest of all women there Who joined Mount Sion to the Apennines. That is, sanctified the Apennines by her burial on the Monte della Sambuca. DANTE DA MAIANO I TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He interprets Dante Alighieri's Dream, related in the first Sonnet of the Vita Nuova See ante, page 312. Of that wherein thou art a questioner Considering, I make answer briefly thus, Good friend, in wit but little prosperous: And from my words the truth thou shalt infer,— So hearken to thy dream's interpreter. If, sound of frame, thou soundly canst discuss In reason,—then, to expel this overplus Of vapours which hath made thy speech to err, See that thou lave and purge thy stomach soon. But if thou art afflicted with disease, Know that I count it mere delirium. Thus of my thought I write thee back the sum: Nor my conclusions can be changed from these Till to the leach thy water I have shown. II Sonnet He craves interpreting of a Dream of his Thou that art wise, let wisdom minister Unto my dream, that it be understood. To wit: A lady, of her body fair, And whom my heart approves in womanhood, Bestowed on me a wreath of flowers, fair-hued And green in leaf, with gentle loving air; After the which, meseemed I was stark nude Save for a smock of hers that I did wear. Whereat, good friend, my courage gat such growth That to mine arms I took her tenderly: With no rebuke the beauty laughed unloth, And as she laughed I kissed continually. I say no more, for that I pledged mine oath, And that my mother, who is dead, was by. GUIDO ORLANDI TO DANTE DA MAIANO Sonnet He interprets the Dream There exist no fewer than six answers by different poets, interpreting Dante da Maiano's dream. I have chosen Guido Orlandi's, much the most matter-of-fact of the six, because it is diverting to find the writer again in his antagonistic mood. Among the five remaining answers, in all of which the vision is treated as a very mysterious matter, one is attributed to Dante Alighieri, but seems so doubtful that I have not translated it. Indeed, it would do the greater Dante, if he really wrote it, little credit as a lucid interpreter of dreams; though it might have some interest, as giving him (when compared with the sonnet at page 388) a decided advantage over his lesser namesake in point of courtesy. related in the foregoing Sonnet On the last words of what you write to me I give you my opinion at the first, To see the dead must prove corruption nursed Within you, by your heart's own vanity. The soul should bend the flesh to its decree: Then rule it, friend, as fish by line amerced. As to the smock, your lady's gift, the worst Of words were not too bad for speech so free. It is a thing unseemly to declare The love of gracious dame or damozel, And therewith for excuse to say, I dream'd. Tell us no more of this, but think who seem'd To call you: mother came to whip you well. Love close, and of Love's joy you'll have your share III Sonnet To his Lady Nina, of Sicily So greatly thy great pleasaunce pleasured me, Gentle my lady, from the first of all, That counting every other blessing small I gave myself up wholly to know thee: And since I was made thine, thy courtesy And worth, more than of earth, celestial, I learned, and from its freedom did enthrall My heart, the servant of thy grace to be. Wherefore I pray thee, joyful countenance, Humbly, that it incense or irk thee not, If I, being thine, do wait upon thy glance. More to solicit, I am all afraid: Yet, lady, twofold is the gift, we wot, Given to the needy unsolicited. IV Sonnet He thanks his Lady for the Joy he has had from her Wonderful countenance and royal neck, I have not found your beauty's parallel! Nor at her birth might any yet prevail The likeness of these features to partake. Wisdom is theirs, and mildness: for whose sake All grace seems stol'n, such perfect grace to swell; Fashioned of God beyond delight to dwell Exalted. And herein my pride I take Who of this garden have possession, So that all worth subsists for my behoof And bears itself according to my will. Lady, in thee such pleasaunce hath its fill That whoso is content to rest thereon Knows not of grief, and holds all pain aloof. CECCO ANGIOLIERI, DA SIENA I TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet On the last Sonnet of the Vita Nuova See ante, page 346. Dante Alighieri, Cecco, your good friend And servant, gives you greeting as his lord, And prays you for the sake of Love's accord, Love being the Master before whom you bend,) That you will pardon him if he offend, Even as your gentle heart can well afford. All that he wants to say is just one word Which partly chides your sonnet at the end. For where the measure changes, first you say You do not understand the gentle speech A spirit made touching your Beatrice: And next you tell your ladies how, straightway, You understand it. Wherefore (look you) each Of these your words the other's sense denies. II Sonnet He will not be too deeply in Love I am enamoured, and yet not so much But that I'd do without it easily; And my own mind thinks all the more of me That Love has not quite penned me in his hutch. Enough if for his sake I dance and touch The lute, and serve his servants cheerfully: An overdose is worse than none would be: Love is no lord of mine, I'm proud to vouch. So let no woman who is born conceive That I'll be her liege slave, as I see some, Be she as fair and dainty as she will. Too much of love makes idiots, I believe: I like not any fashion that turns glum The heart, and makes the visage sick and ill. III Sonnet Of Love in Men and Devils The man who feels not, more or less, somewhat Of love in all the years his life goes round Should be denied a grave in holy ground Except with usurers who will bate no groat: Nor he himself should count himself a jot Less wretched than the meanest beggar found. Also the man who in Love's robe is gown'd May say that Fortune smiles upon his lot. Seeing how love has such nobility That if it entered in the lord of Hell 'Twould rule him more than his fire's ancient sting; He should be glorified to eternity, And all his life be always glad and well As is a wanton woman in the spring. IV Sonnet Of Love, in honour of his mistress Becchina Whatever good is naturally done Is born of Love as fruit is born of flower: By Love all good is brought to its full power: Yea, Love does more than this; for he finds none So coarse but from his touch some grace is won, And the poor wretch is altered in an hour. So let it be decreed that Death devour The beast who says that Love's a thing to shun. A man's just worth the good that he can hold, And where no love is found, no good is there; On that there's nothing that I would not stake. So now, my Sonnet, go as you are told To lovers and their sweethearts everywhere, And say I made you for Becchina's sake. V Sonnet Of Becchina, the Shoemaker's Daughter Why, if Becchina's heart were diamond, And all the other parts of her were steel, As cold to love as snows when they congeal In lands to which the sun may not get round; And if her father were a giant crown'd And not a donkey born to stitching shoes, Or I were but an ass myself;—to use Such harshness, scarce could to her praise redound. Yet if she'd only for a minute hear, And I could speak if only pretty well, I'd let her know that I'm her happiness; That I'm her life should also be made clear, With other things that I've no need to tell; And then I feel quite sure she'd answer Yes. VI Sonnet To Messer Angiolieri, his Father If I'd a sack of florins, and all new, (Packed tight together, freshly coined and fine,) And Arcidosso and Montegiovi mine, Perhaps the names of his father's estates. And quite a glut of eagle-pieces too,— It were but as three farthings to my view Without Becchina. Why then all these plots To whip me, daddy? Nay, but tell me—what's My sin, or all the sins of Turks, to you? For I protest (or may I be struck dead!) My love's so firmly planted in its place, Whipping nor hanging now could change the grain. And if you want my reason on this head, It is that whoso looks her in the face, Though he were old, gets back his youth again. VII Sonnet Of the 20th June 1291 I'm full of everything I do not want, And have not that wherein I should find ease; For alway till Becchina brings me peace The heavy heart I bear must toil and pant; That so all written paper would prove scant (Though in its space the Bible you might squeeze,) To say how like the flames of furnaces I burn, remembering what she used to grant. Because the stars are fewer in heaven's span Than all those kisses wherewith I kept tune All in an instant (I who now have none!) Upon her mouth (I and no other man!) So sweetly on the twentieth day of June In the new year The year, according to the calendar of those days, began on the 25th March. The alteration to 1st January was made in 1582 by the Pope, and immediately adopted by all Catholic countries, but by England not till 1752. There is some added vividness in remembering that Cecco's unplatonic love-encounter dates eleven days after the first death-anniversary of Beatrice (9th of June 1291), when Dante tells us that he “drew the resemblance of an angel upon certain tablets.” (See ante, p. 340.) twelve hundred ninety-one. VIII Sonnet In absence from Becchina My heart's so heavy with a hundred things That I feel dead a hundred times a-day; Yet death would be the least of sufferings, For life's all suffering save what's slept away; Though even in sleep there is no dream but brings From dream-land such dull torture as it may. And yet one moment would pluck out these stings, If for one moment she were mine to-day Who gives my heart the anguish that it has. Each thought that seeks my heart for its abode Becomes a wan and sorrow-stricken guest: Sorrow has brought me to so sad a pass That men look sad to meet me on the road; Nor any road is mine that leads to rest. IX Sonnet Of Becchina in a rage When I behold Becchina in a rage, Just like a little lad I trembling stand Whose master tells him to hold out his hand; Had I a lion's heart, the sight would wage Such war against it, that in that sad stage I'd wish my birth might never have been plann'd, And curse the day and hour that I was bann'd With such a plague for my life's heritage. Yet even if I should sell me to the Fiend, I must so manage matters in some way That for her rage I may not care a fig; Or else from death I cannot long be screen'd. So I'll not blink the fact, but plainly say It's time I got my valour to grow big. X Sonnet He rails against Dante, who had censured his homage to Becchina Dante Alighieri in Becchina's praise Won't have me sing, and bears him like my lord. He's but a pinchbeck florin, on my word; Sugar he seems, but salt's in all his ways; He looks like wheaten bread, who's bread of maize; He's but a sty, though like a tower in height; A falcon, till you find that he's a kite; Call him a cock!—a hen's more like his case. Go now to Florence, Sonnet of my own, And there with dames and maids hold pretty parles, And say that all he is doth only seem. And I meanwhile will make him better known Unto the Count of Provence, good King Charles; This may be either Charles II., King of Naples and Count of Provence, or more probably his son Charles Martel, King of Hungary. We know from Dante that a friendship subsisted between himself and the latter prince, who visited Florence in 1295, and died in the same year, in his father's lifetime (Paradise, C. viii.) And in this way we'll singe his skin for him. XI Sonnet Of his four Tormentors I'm caught, like any thrush the nets surprise, By Daddy and Becchina, Mammy and Love. As to the first-named, let thus much suffice,— Each day he damns me, and each hour thereof; Becchina wants so much of all that's nice, Not Mahomet himself could yield enough; And Love still sets me doting in a trice On trulls who'd seem the Ghetto's proper stuff. My mother don't do much because she can't, But I may count it just as good as done, Knowing the way and not the will's her want. To-day I tried a kiss with her—just one— To see if I could make her sulks avaunt: She said, “The devil rip you up, my son!” XII Sonnet Concerning his Father The dreadful and the desperate hate I bear My father (to my praise, not to my shame,) Will make him live more than Methusalem; Of this I've long ago been made aware. Now tell me, Nature, if my hate's not fair. A glass of some thin wine not worth a name One day I begged (he has whole butts o'the same,) And he had almost killed me, I declare. “Good Lord, if I had asked for vernage-wine!” Said I; for if he'd spit into my face I wished to see for reasons of my own. Now say that I mayn't hate this plague of mine! Why, if you knew what I know of his ways, You'd tell me that I ought to knock him down. I have thought it necessary to soften one or two expressions in this sonnet. XIII Sonnet Of all he would do If I were fire, I'd burn the world away; If I were wind, I'd turn my storms thereon; If I were water, I'd soon let it drown; If I were God, I'd sink it from the day; If I were Pope, I'd never feel quite gay Until there was no peace beneath the sun; If I were Emperor, what would I have done?— I'd lop men's heads all round in my own way. If I were Death, I'd look my father up; If I were Life, I'd run away from him; And treat my mother to like calls and runs. If I were Cecco (and that's all my hope), I'd pick the nicest girls to suit my whim, And other folk should get the ugly ones. XIV Sonnet He is past all Help For a thing done, repentance is no good, Nor to say after, Thus would I have done: In life, what's left behind is vainly rued; So let a man get used his hurt to shun; For on his legs he hardly may be stood Again, if once his fall be well begun. But to show wisdom's what I never could; So where I itch I scratch now, and all's one. I'm down, and cannot rise in any way; For not a creature of my nearest kin Would hold me out a hand that I could reach. I pray you do not mock at what I say; For so my love's good grace may I not win If ever sonnet held so true a speech! XV Sonnet Of why he is unhanged Whoever without money is in love Had better build a gallows and go hang; He dies not once, but oftener feels the pang Than he who was cast down from Heaven above. And certes, for my sins, it's plain enough, If Love's alive on earth, that he's myself, Who would not be so cursed with want of pelf If others paid my proper dues thereof. Then why am I not hanged by my own hands? I answer: for this empty narrow chink Of hope;—that I've a father old and rich, And that if once he dies I'll get his lands; And die he must, when the sea's dry, I think. Meanwhile God keeps him whole and me i'the ditch. XVI Sonnet Of why he would be a Scullion I am so out of love through poverty That if I see my mistress in the street I hardly can be certain whom I meet, And of her name do scarce remember me. Also my courage it has made to be So cold, that if I suffered some foul cheat, Even from the meanest wretch that one could beat, Save for the sin I think he should go free. Ay, and it plays me a still nastier trick; For, meeting some who erewhile with me took Delight, I seem to them a roaring fire. So here's a truth whereat I need not stick;— That if one could turn scullion to a cook, It were a thing to which one might aspire. XVII Prolonged Sonnet When his Clothes were gone Never so bare and naked was church-stone As is my clean-stripped doublet in my grasp; Also I wear a shirt without a clasp, Which is a dismal thing to look upon. Ah! had I still but the sweet coins I won That time I sold my nag and staked the pay, I'd not lie hid beneath the roof to-day And eke out sonnets with this moping moan. Daily a thousand times stark mad am I At my dad's meanness who won't clothe me now, For “How about the horse?” is still his cry. Till one thing strikes me as clear anyhow,— No rag I'll get. The wretch has sworn, I see, Not to invest another doit in me. And all because of the fine doublet's price He gave me, when I vowed to throw no dice, And for his damned nag's sake! Well, this is nice! XVIII Sonnet He argues his case with Death Gramercy, Death, as you've my love to win, Just be impartial in your next assault; And that you may not find yourself in fault, Whate'er you do, be quick now and begin. As oft may I be pounded flat and thin As in Grosseto there are grains of salt, If now to kill us both you be not call'd,— Both me and him who sticks so in his skin. Or better still, look here; for if I'm slain Alone,—his wealth, it's true, I'll never have, Yet death is life to one who lives in pain; But if you only kill Saldagno's knave, I'm left in Siena (don't you see your gain?) Like a rich man who's made a galley-slave. He means, possibly, that he should be more than ever tormented by his creditors on account of their knowing his ability to pay them; but the meaning seems very uncertain. XIX Sonnet Of Becchina, and of her Husband I would like better in the grace to be Of the dear mistress whom I bear in mind (As once I was) than I should like to find A stream that washed up gold continually: Because no language could report of me The joys that round my heart would then be twin'd, Who now, without her love, do seem resign'd To death that bends my life to its decree. And one thing makes the matter still more sad: For all the while I know the fault's my own, That on her husband I take no revenge, Who's worse to her than is to me my dad. God send grief has not pulled my courage down, That hearing this I laugh; for it seems strange. XX Sonnet To Becchina's rich Husband This puzzling sonnet is printed in Italian collections with the name of Guido Cavalcanti. It must evidently belong to Angiolieri, and it has certain fine points which make me unwilling to omit it; though partly as to rendering, and wholly as to application, I have been driven on conjecture. As thou wert loth to see, before thy feet, The dear broad coin roll all the hill-slope down, Till, gathering it from rifted clods, some clown Should rub it oft and scarcely render it;— Tell me, I charge thee, if by generous heat Or clutching frost the fruits of earth be grown, And by what wind the blight is o'er them strown, And with what gloom the tempest is replete. Yet daily, in good sooth, as morn by morn Thou hear'st the voice of thy poor husbandman And those loud herds, his other family,— I know, as surely as Becchina's born With a kind heart, she does the best she can To filch at least one new-bought prize from thee. XXI Sonnet On the Death of his Father Let not the inhabitants of Hell despair, For one's got out who seemed to be locked in; And Cecco's the poor devil that I mean, Who thought for ever and ever to be there. But the leaf's turned at last, and I declare That now my state of glory doth begin: For Messer Angiolieri's slipped his skin, Who plagued me, summer and winter, many a year. Make haste to Cecco, Sonnet, with a will, To him who no more at the Abbey dwells; Tell him that Brother Henry's half dried up. It would almost seem as if Cecco, in his poverty, had at last taken refuge in a religious house under the name of Brother Henry (Frate Arrigo), and as if he here meant that Brother Henry was now decayed, so to speak, through the resuscitation of Cecco. (See Introduction to Part I., p. 307.) He'll never more be down-at-mouth, but fill His beak at his own beck, In the original words, “Ma di tal cibo imbecchi lo suo becco,” a play upon the name of Becchina seems intended, which I have conveyed as well as I could. till his life swells To more than Enoch's or Elijah's scope. XXII Sonnet He would slay all who hate their Fathers Who utters of his father aught but praise, 'Twere well to cut his tongue out of his mouth; Because the Deadly Sins are seven, yet doth No one provoke such ire as this must raise. Were I a priest, or monk in anyways, Unto the Pope my first respects were paid, Saying, “Holy Father, let a just crusade Scourge each man who his sire's good name gainsays.” And if by chance a handful of such rogues At any time should come into our clutch, I'd have them cooked and eaten then and there, If not by men, at least by wolves and dogs. The Lord forgive me! for I fear me much Some words of mine were rather foul than fair. XXIII TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He writes to Dante, then in exile at Verona, defying him as no better than himself Dante Alighieri, if I jest and lie, You in such lists might run a tilt with me: I get my dinner, you your supper, free; And if I bite the fat, you suck the fry; I shear the cloth and you the teazle ply; If I've a strut, who's prouder than you are? If I'm foul-mouthed, you're not particular; And you're turned Lombard, even if Roman I. So that, 'fore Heaven! if either of us flings Much dirt at the other, he must be a fool: For lack of luck and wit we do these things. Yet if you want more lessons at my school, Just say so, and you'll find the next touch stings— For, Dante, I'm the goad and you're the bull. GUIDO ORLANDI Several other pieces by this author, addressed to Guido Cavalcanti and Dante da Maiano, will be found among their poems. Sonnet Against the “White” Ghibellines Now of the hue of ashes are the Whites; And they go following now after the kind Of creatures we call crabs, which, as some find, Will only seek their natural food o'nights. All day they hide; their flesh has such sore frights Lest Death be come for them on every wind, Lest now the Lion's I.e. Florence. wrath be so inclined That they may never set their sin to rights. Guelf were they once, and now are Ghibelline: Nothing but rebels henceforth be they named,— State-foes, as are the Uberti, every one. Behold, against the Whites all men must sign Some judgment whence no pardon can be claim'd Excepting they were offered to Saint John. That is, presented at the high altar on the feast-day of St. John the Baptist; a ceremony attending the release of criminals, a certain number of whom were annually pardoned on that day in Florence. This was the disgraceful condition annexed to that recall to Florence which Dante received when in exile at the court of Verona; which others accepted, but which was refused by him in a memorable epistle still preserved. LAPO GIANNI I Madrigal What Love shall provide for him Love, I demand to have my lady in fee. Fine balm let Arno be; The walls of Florence all of silver rear'd, And crystal pavements in the public way. With castles make me fear'd, Till every Latin soul have owned my sway. Be the world peaceful; safe throughout each path; No neighbour to breed wrath; The air, summer and winter, temperate. A thousand dames and damsels richly clad Upon my choice to wait, Singing by day and night to make me glad. Let me have fruitful gardens of great girth, Filled with the strife of birds, With water-springs, and beasts that house i'the earth. Let me seem Solomon for lore of words, Samson for strength, for beauty Absalom. Knights as my serfs be given; And as I will, let music go and come; Till at the last thou bring me into Heaven. II Ballata A Message in charge for his Lady Lagia Ballad, since Love himself hath fashioned thee Within my mind where he doth make abode, Hie thee to her who through mine eyes bestow'd Her blessing on my heart, which stays with me. Since thou wast born a handmaiden of Love, With every grace thou should'st be perfected, And everywhere seem gentle, wise, and sweet. And for that thine aspect gives sign thereof, I do not tell thee, “Thus much must be said”:— Hoping, if thou inheritest my wit, And com'st on her when speech may ill befit, That thou wilt say no words of any kind: But when her ear is graciously inclin'd, Address her without dread submissively. Afterward, when thy courteous speech is done, (Ended with fair obeisance and salute To that chief forehead of serenest good,) Wait thou the answer which, in heavenly tone, Shall haply stir between her lips, nigh mute For gentleness and virtuous womanhood. And mark that, if my homage please her mood, No rose shall be incarnate in her cheek, But her soft eyes shall seem subdued and meek, And almost pale her face for delicacy. For, when at last thine amorous discourse Shall have possessed her spirit with that fear Of thoughtful recollection which in love Comes first,—then say thou that my heart implores Only without an end to honour her, Till by God's will my living soul remove: That I take counsel oftentimes with Love; For he first made my hope thus strong and rife, Through whom my heart, my mind, and all my life, Are given in bondage to her seigniory. Then shalt thou find the blessed refuge girt I'the circle of her arms, where pity and grace Have sojourn, with all human excellence: Then shalt thou feel her gentleness exert Its rule (unless, alack! she deem thee base): Then shalt thou know her sweet intelligence: Then shalt thou see—O marvel most intense!— What thing the beauty of the angels is, And what are the miraculous harmonies Whereon Love rears the heights of sovereignty. Move, Ballad, so that none take note of thee, Until thou set thy footsteps in Love's road. Having arrived, speak with thy visage bow'd, And bring no false doubt back, or jealousy. DINO FRESCOBALDI I Sonnet Of what his Lady is This is the damsel by whom love is brought To enter at his eyes that looks on her; This is the righteous maid, the comforter, Whom every virtue honours unbesought. Love, journeying with her, unto smiles is wrought, Showing the glory which surrounds her there; Who, when a lowly heart prefers its prayer, Can make that its transgression come to nought. And, when she giveth greeting, by Love's rule, With sweet reserve she somewhat lifts her eyes Bestowing that desire which speaks to us. Alone on what is noble looks she thus, Its opposite rejecting in like wise, This pitiful young maiden beautiful. II Sonnet Of the Star of his Love That star the highest seen in heaven's expanse Not yet forsakes me with its lovely light: It gave me her who from her heaven's pure height Gives all the grace mine intellect demands. Thence a new arrow of strength is in my hands Which bears good will whereso it may alight; So barbed, that no man's body or soul its flight Has wounded yet, nor shall wound any man's. Glad am I therefore that her grace should fall Not otherwise than thus; whose rich increase Is such a power as evil cannot dim. My sins within an instant perished all When I inhaled the light of so much peace. And this Love knows; for I have told it him. GIOTTO DI BONDONE Canzone Of the Doctrine of Voluntary Poverty Many there are, praisers of Poverty; The which as man's best state is register'd When by free choice preferred, With strict observance having nothing here. For this they find certain authority Wrought of an over-nice interpreting. Now as concerns such thing, A hard extreme it doth to me appear, Which to commend I fear, For seldom are extremes without some vice. Let every edifice, Of work or word, secure foundation find; Against the potent wind, And all things perilous, so well prepar'd That it need no correction afterward. Of poverty which is against the will, It never can be doubted that therein Lies broad the way to sin. For oftentimes it makes the judge unjust; In dames and damsels doth their honour kill; And begets violence and villanies, And theft and wicked lies, And casts a good man from his fellows' trust. And for a little dust Of gold that lacks, wit seems a lacking too. If once the coat give view Of the real back, farewell all dignity. Each therefore strives that he Should by no means admit her to his sight, Who, only thought on, makes his face turn white. Of poverty which seems by choice elect, I may pronounce from plain experience,— Not of mine own pretence,— That 'tis observed or unobserved at will. Nor its observance asks our full respect: For no discernment, nor integrity, Nor lore of life, nor plea Of virtue, can her cold regard instil. I call it shame and ill To name as virtue that which stifles good. I call it grossly rude, On a thing bestial to make consequent Virtue's inspired advènt To understanding hearts acceptable: For the most wise most love with her to dwell. Here mayst thou find some issue of demur: For lo! our Lord commendeth poverty. Nay, what His meaning be Search well: His words are wonderfully deep, Oft doubly sensed, asking interpreter. The state for each most saving, is His will For each. Thine eyes unseal, And look within, the inmost truth to reap. Behold what concord keep His holy words with His most holy life. In Him the power was rife Which to all things apportions time and place. On earth He chose such case; And why? 'Twas His to point a higher life. But here, on earth, our senses show us still How they who preach this thing are least at peace, And evermore increase Much thought how from this thing they should escape. For if one such a lofty station fill, He shall assert his strength like a wild wolf, Or daily mask himself Afresh, until his will be brought to shape; Ay, and so wear the cape That direst wolf shall seem like sweetest lamb Beneath the constant sham. Hence, by their art, this doctrine plagues the world: And hence, till they be hurl'd From where they sit in high hypocrisy, No corner of the world seems safe to me. Go, Song, to some sworn owls that we have known And on their folly bring them to reflect: But if they be stiff-neck'd, Belabour them until their heads are down. SIMONE DALL' ANTELLA Prolonged Sonnet In the last Days of the Emperor Henry VII Along the road all shapes must travel by, How swiftly, to my thinking, now doth fare The wanderer who built his watchtower there Where wind is torn with wind continually! Lo! from the world and its dull pain to fly, Unto such pinnacle did he repair, And of her presence was not made aware, Whose face, that looks like Peace, is Death's own lie. Alas, Ambition, thou his enemy, Who lurest the poor wanderer on his way, But never bring'st him where his rest may be,— O leave him now, for he is gone astray Himself out of his very self through thee, Till now the broken stems his feet betray, And, caught with boughs before and boughs behind, Deep in thy tangled wood he sinks entwin'd. GIOVANNI QUIRINO TO DANTE ALIGHIERI Sonnet He commends the work of Dante's life, then drawing to its close; and deplores his own deficiencies Glory to God and to God's Mother chaste, Dear friend, is all the labour of thy days: Thou art as he who evermore uplays That heavenly wealth which the worm cannot waste: So shalt thou render back with interest The precious talent given thee by God's grace: While I, for my part, follow in their ways Who by the cares of this world are possess'd. For, as the shadow of the earth doth make The moon's globe dark, when so she is debarr'd From the bright rays which lit her in the sky,— So now, since thou my sun didst me forsake, (Being distant from me), I grow dull and hard, Even as a beast of Epicurus' sty. DANTE ALIGHIERI TO GIOVANNI QUIRINO Sonnet He answers the foregoing Sonnet; saying what he feels at the approach of Death The King by whose rich grace His servants be With plenty beyond measure set to dwell Ordains that I my bitter wrath dispel And lift mine eyes to the great consistory; Till, noting how in glorious quires agree The citizens of that fair citadel, To the Creator I His creature swell Their song, and all their love possesses me. So, when I contemplate the great reward To which our God has called the Christian seed, I long for nothing else but only this. And then my soul is grieved in thy regard, Dear friend, who reck'st not of thy nearest need, Renouncing for slight joys the perfect bliss. APPENDIX TO PART I I Forese Donati I Dante Alighieri to Forese Donati He taunts Forese, by the nickname of Bicci O Bicci, pretty son of who knows whom Unless thy mother Lady Tessa tell,— Thy gullet is already crammed too well, Yet others' food thou needs must now consume. Lo! he that wears a purse makes ample room When thou goest by in any public place, Saying, “This fellow with the branded face Is thief apparent from his mother's womb.” And I know one who's fain to keep his bed Lest thou shouldst filch it, at whose birth he stood Like Joseph when the world its Christmas saw. Of Bicci and his brothers it is said That with the heat of misbegotten blood Among their wives they are nice brothers-in-law. II Forese Donati to Dante Alighieri He taunts Dante ironically for not avenging Geri Alighieri Right well I know thou'rt Alighieri's son; Nay, that revenge alone might warrant it, Which thou didst take, so clever and complete, For thy great-uncle who awhile agone Paid scores in full. Why, if thou hadst hewn one In bits for it, 'twere early still for peace! But then thy head's so heaped with things like these That they would weigh two sumpter-horses down. Thou hast taught us a fair fashion, sooth to say,— That whoso lays a stick well to thy back, Thy comrade and thy brother he shall be. As for their names who've shown thee this good play, I'll tell thee, so thou'lt tell me all the lack Thou hast of help, that I may stand by thee. III Dante Alighieri to Forese Donati He taunts him concerning his Wife To hear the unlucky wife of Bicci cough, (Bicci,—Forese as he's called, you know,—) You'd fancy she had wintered, sure enough, Where icebergs rear themselves in constant snow: And Lord! if in mid-August it is so, How in the frozen months must she come off? To wear her socks abed avails not,—no, Nor quilting from Cortona, warm and tough. Her cough, her cold, and all her other ills, Do not afflict her through the rheum of age, But through some want within her nest, poor spouse! This grief, with other griefs, her mother feels, Who says, “Without much trouble, I'll engage, She might have married in Count Guido's house!” IV Forese Donati to Dante Alighieri He taunts him concerning the unavenged Spirit of Geri Alighieri The other night I had a dreadful cough Because I'd got no bed-clothes over me; And so, when the day broke, I hurried off To seek some gain whatever it might be. And such luck as I had I tell you of. For lo! no jewels hidden in a tree I find, nor buried gold, nor suchlike stuff, But Alighieri among the graves I see, Bound by some spell, I know not at whose 'hest,— At Solomon's, or what sage's who shall say? Therefore I crossed myself towards the east; And he cried out: “For Dante's love I pray Thou loose me!” But I knew not in the least How this were done, so turned and went my way. III Giovanni Boccaccio I To one who had censured his public Exposition of Dante If Dante mourns, there wheresoe'er he be, That such high fancies of a soul so proud Should be laid open to the vulgar crowd, (As, touching my Discourse, I'm told by thee,) This were my grievous pain; and certainly My proper blame should not be disavow'd; Though thereof somewhat, I declare aloud Were due to others, not alone to me. False hopes, true poverty, and therewithal The blinded judgment of a host of friends, And their entreaties, made that I did thus. But of all this there is no gain at all Unto the thankless souls with whose base ends Nothing agrees that's great or generous. II Inscription for a portrait of Dante Dante Alighieri, a dark oracle Of wisdom and of art, I am; whose mind Has to my country such great gifts assign'd That men account my powers a miracle. My lofty fancy passed as low as Hell, As high as Heaven, secure and unconfin'd; And in my noble book doth every kind Of earthly lore and heavenly doctrine dwell. Renownèd Florence was my mother,—nay, Stepmother unto me her piteous son, Through sin of cursed slander's tongue and tooth. Ravenna sheltered me so cast away; My body is with her,—my soul with One For whom no envy can make dim the truth. III To Dante in Paradise, after Fiammetta's death Dante, if thou within the sphere of Love, As I believe, remain'st contemplating Beautiful Beatrice, whom thou didst sing Erewhile, and so wast drawn to her above;— Unless from false life true life thee remove So far that Love's forgotten, let me bring One prayer before thee: for an easy thing This were, to thee whom I do ask it of. I know that where all joy doth most abound In the Third Heaven, my own Fiammetta sees The grief which I have borne since she is dead. O pray her (if mine image be not drown'd In Lethe) that her prayers may never cease Until I reach her and am comforted. IV Of Fiammetta singing Love steered my course, while yet the sun rode high, On Scylla's waters to a myrtle-grove: The heaven was still and the sea did not move; Yet now and then a little breeze went by Stirring the tops of trees against the sky: And then I heard a song as glad as love, So sweet that never yet the like thereof Was heard in any mortal company. “A nymph, a goddess, or an angel sings Unto herself, within this chosen place, Of ancient loves;” so said I at that sound. And there my lady, 'mid the shadowings Of myrtle-trees, 'mid flowers and grassy space, Singing I saw, with others who sat round. V Of his last sight of Fiammetta Round her red garland and her golden hair I saw a fire about Fiammetta's head; Thence to a little cloud I watched it fade, Than silver or than gold more brightly fair; And like a pearl that a gold ring doth bear, Even so an angel sat therein, who sped Alone and glorious throughout heaven, array'd In sapphires and in gold that lit the air. Then I rejoiced as hoping happy things, Who rather should have then discerned how God Had haste to make my lady all His own, Even as it came to pass. And with these stings Of sorrow, and with life's most weary load I dwell, who fain would be where she is gone. VI Of three Girls and of their Talk By a clear well, within a little field Full of green grass and flowers of every hue, Sat three young girls, relating (as I knew) Their loves. And each had twined a bough to shield Her lovely face; and the green leaves did yield The golden hair their shadow; while the two Sweet colours mingled, both blown lightly through With a soft wind for ever stirred and still'd. After a little while one of them said, (I heard her,) “Think! If, ere the next hour struck, Each of our lovers should come here to-day, Think you that we should fly or feel afraid?” To whom the others answered, “From such luck A girl would be a fool to run away.” End of Part I PART II POETS CHIEFLY BEFORE DANTE CIULLO D'ALCAMO Dialogue Lover and Lady He Thou sweetly-smelling fresh red rose That near thy summer art, Of whom each damsel and each dame Would fain be counterpart; Oh! from this fire to draw me forth Be it in thy good heart: For night or day there is no rest with me, Thinking of none, my lady, but of thee. She If thou hast set thy thoughts on me, Thou hast done a foolish thing. Yea, all the pine-wood of this world Together might'st thou bring, And make thee ships, and plough the sea Therewith for corn-sowing, Ere any way to win me could be found: For I am going to shear my locks all round. He Lady, before thou shear thy locks I hope I may be dead: For I should lose such joy thereby And gain such grief instead. Merely to pass and look at thee, Rose of the garden-bed, Has comforted me much, once and again. Oh! if thou wouldst but love, what were it then! She Nay, though my heart were prone to love, I would not grant it leave. Hark! should my father or his kin But find thee here this eve, Thy loving body and lost breath Our moat may well receive. Whatever path to come here thou dost know, By the same path I counsel thee to go. He And if thy kinsfolk find me here, Shall I be drowned then? Marry, I'll set, for price against my head, Two thousand agostari. I think thy father would not do't For all his lands in Bari. Long life to the Emperor! Be God's the praise! Thou hear'st, my beauty, what thy servant says. She And am I then to have no peace Morning or evening? I have strong coffers of my own And much good gold therein; So that if thou couldst offer me The wealth of Saladin, And add to that the Soldan's money-hoard, Thy suit would not be anything toward. He I have known many women, love, Whose thoughts were high and proud, And yet have been made gentle by Man's speech not over-loud. If we but press ye long enough, At length ye will be bow'd; For still a woman's weaker than a man. When the end comes, recall how this began. She God grant that I may die before Any such end do come,— Before the sight of a chaste maid Seem to me troublesome! I marked thee here all yestereve Lurking about my home, And now I say, Leave climbing, lest thou fall, For these thy words delight me not at all. He How many are the cunning chains Thou hast wound round my heart! Only to think upon thy voice Sometimes I groan apart. For I did never love a maid Of this world, as thou art, So much as I love thee, thou crimson rose. Thou wilt be mine at last: this my soul knows. She If I could think it would be so, Small pride it were of mine That all my beauty should be meant But to make thee to shine. Sooner than stoop to that, I'd shear These golden tresses fine, And make one of some holy sisterhood; Escaping so thy love, which is not good. He If thou unto the cloister fly, Thou cruel lady and cold, Unto the cloister I will come And by the cloister hold; For such a conquest liketh me Much better than much gold; At matins and at vespers, I shall be Still where thou art. Have I not conquered thee? She Out and alack! wherefore am I Tormented in suchwise? Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour, In whom my best hope lies, O give me strength that I may hush This vain man's blasphemies! Let him seek through the earth; 'tis long and broad: He will find fairer damsels, O my God! He I have sought through Calabria, Lombardy, and Tuscany, Rome, Pisa, Lucca, Genoa, All between sea and sea: Yea, even to Babylon I went And distant Barbary: But not a woman found I anywhere Equal to thee, who art indeed most fair. She If thou have all this love for me, Thou canst no better do Than ask me of my father dear And my dear mother too: They willing, to the abbey-church We will together go, And, before Advent, thou and I will wed; After the which, I'll do as thou hast said. He These thy conditions, lady mine, Are altogether nought: Despite of them, I'll make a net Wherein thou shalt be caught. What, wilt thou put on wings to fly? Nay, but of wax they're wrought,— They'll let thee fall to earth, not rise with thee. So, if thou canst, then keep thyself from me. She Think not to fright me with thy nets And suchlike childish gear; I am safe pent within the walls Of this strong castle here; A boy before he is a man Could give me as much fear. If suddenly thou get not hence again, It is my prayer thou mayst be found and slain. He Wouldst thou in very truth that I Were slain, and for thy sake? Then let them hew me to such mince As a man's limbs may make! But meanwhile I shall not stir hence Till of that fruit I take Which thou hast in thy garden, ripe enough: All day and night I thirst to think thereof, She None have partaken of that fruit, Not Counts nor Cavaliers: Though many have reached up for it, Barons and great Seigneurs, They all went hence in wrath because They could not make it theirs. Then how canst thou think to succeed alone Who hast not a thousand ounces of thine own? He How many nosegays I have sent Unto thy house, sweet soul! At least till I am put to proof, This scorn of thine control. For if the wind, so fair for thee, Turn ever and wax foul, Be sure that thou shalt say when all is done, “Now is my heart heavy for him that's gone.” She If by my grief thou couldst be grieved, God send me a grief soon! I tell thee that though all my friends Prayed me as for a boon, Saying, “Even for the love of us, Love thou this worthless loon,” Thou shouldst not have the thing that thou dost hope. No, verily; nor for the realm o'the Pope. He Now could I wish that I in truth Were dead here in thy house: My soul would get its vengeance then; Once known, the thing would rouse A rabble, and they'd point and say,— “Lo! she that breaks her vows, And, in her dainty chamber, stabs!” Love, see: One strikes just thus: it is soon done, pardie! She If now thou do not hasten hence, (My curse companioning), That my stout friends will find thee here Is a most certain thing: After the which, my gallant sir, Thy points of reasoning May chance, I think, to stand thee in small stead, Thou hast no friend, sweet friend, to bring thee aid. He Thou sayest truly, saying that I have not any friend: A landless stranger, lady mine, None but his sword defend. One year ago, my love began, And now, is this the end? Oh! the rich dress thou worest on that day Since when thou art walking at my side alway! She So 'twas my dress enamoured thee! What marvel? I did wear A cloth of samite silver-flowered, And gems within my hair. But one more word; if on Christ's Book To wed me thou didst swear, There's nothing now could win me to be thine: I had rather make my bed in the sea-brine. He And if thou make thy bed therein, Most courteous lady and bland, I'll follow all among the waves, Paddling with foot and hand; Then, when the sea hath done with thee, I'll seek thee on the sand. For I will not be conquered in this strife: I'll wait, but win; or losing, lose my life. She For Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three times I cross myself. Thou art no godless heretic, Nor Jew, whose God's his pelf: Even as I know it then, meseems, Thou needs must know thyself That woman, when the breath in her doth cease, Loseth all savour and all loveliness. He Woe's me! Perforce it must be said No craft could then avail: So that if thou be thus resolved, I know my suit must fail. Then have some pity, of thy grace! Thou mayst, love, very well; For though thou love not me, my love is such That 'tis enough for both—yea overmuch. She Is it even so? Learn then that I Do love thee from my heart. To-morrow, early in the day, Come here, but now depart. By thine obedience in this thing I shall know what thou art, And if thy love be real or nothing worth; Do but go now, and I am thine henceforth. He Nay, for such promise, my own life, I will not stir a foot. I've said, if thou wouldst tear away My love even from its root, I have a dagger at my side Which thou mayst take to do't: But as for going hence, it will not be. O hate me not! my heart is burning me. She Think'st thou I know not that thy heart Is hot and burns to death? Of all that thou or I can say, But one word succoureth. Till thou upon the Holy Book Give me thy bounden faith, God is my witness that I will not yield: For with thy sword 'twere better to be kill'd. He Then on Christ's Book, borne with me still To read from and to pray, (I took it, fairest, in a church, The priest being gone away,) I swear that my whole self shall be Thine always from this day. And now at once give joy for all my grief, Lest my soul fly, that's thinner than a leaf. She Now that this oath is sworn, sweet lord, There is no need to speak; My heart, that was so strong before, Now feels itself grow weak. If any of my words were harsh, Thy pardon: I am meek Now, and will give thee entrance presently. It is best so, sith so it was to be. FOLCACHIERO DE' FOLCACHIERI, KNIGHT OF SIENA Canzone He speaks of his condition through Love All the whole world is living without war, And yet I cannot find out any peace. O God! that this should be! O God! what does the earth sustain me for? My life seems made for other lives' ill-ease: All men look strange to me; Nor are the wood-flowers now As once, when up above The happy birds in love Made such sweet verses, going from bough to bough. And if I come where other gentlemen Bear arms, or say of love some joyful thing— Then is my grief most sore, And all my soul turns round upon me then: Folk also gaze upon me, whispering, Because I am not what I was before. I know not what I am. I know how wearisome My life is now become, And that the days I pass seem all the same. I think that I shall die; yea, death begins; Though 'tis no set-down sickness that I have, Nor are my pains set down. But to wear raiment seems a burden since This came, nor ever any food I crave; Not any cure is known To me, nor unto whom I might commend my case: This evil therefore stays Still where it is, and hope can find no room. I know that it must certainly be Love: No other Lord, being thus set over me, Had judged me to this curse; With such high hand he rules, sitting above, That of myself he takes two parts in fee, Only the third being hers. Yet if through service I Be justified with God, He shall remove this load, Because my heart with inmost love doth sigh. Gentle my lady, after I am gone, There will not come another, it may be, To show thee love like mine: For nothing can I do, neither have done, Except what proves that I belong to thee And am a thing of thine. Be it not said that I Despaired and perished, then; But pour thy grace, like rain, On him who is burned up, yea, visibly. LODOVICO DELLA VERNACCIA Sonnet He exhorts the State to vigilance Think a brief while on the most marvellous arts Of our high-purposed labour, citizens; And having thought, draw clear conclusion thence; And say, do not ours seem but childish parts? Also on these intestine sores and smarts Ponder advisedly; and the deep sense Thereof shall bow your heads in penitence, And like a thorn shall grow into your hearts. If, of our foreign foes, some prince or lord Is now, perchance, some whit less troublesome, Shall the sword therefore drop into the sheath? Nay, grasp it as the friend that warranteth: For unto this vile rout, our foes at home, Nothing is high or awful save the sword. SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI Cantica Our Lord Christ: of Order This speech occurs in a long poem on Divine Love, half ecstatic, half scholastic, and hardly appreciable now. The passage stands well by itself, and is the only one spoken by our Lord. Set Love in order, thou that lovest Me. Never was virtue out of order found; And though I fill thy heart desirously, By thine own virtue I must keep My ground: When to My love thou dost bring charity, Even she must come with order girt and gown'd. Look how the trees are bound To order, bearing fruit; And by one thing compute, In all things earthly, order's grace or gain. All earthly things I had the making of Were numbered and were measured then by Me; And each was ordered to its end by Love, Each kept, through order, clean for ministry. Charity most of all, when known enough, Is of her very nature orderly, Lo, now! what heat in thee, Soul, can have bred this rout? Thou putt'st all order out. Even this love's heat must be its curb and rein. FREDERICK II. EMPEROR Canzone Of his Lady in bondage For grief I am about to sing, Even as another would for joy; Mine eyes which the hot tears destroy Are scarce enough for sorrowing: To speak of such a grievous thing Also my tongue I must employ, Saying: Woe's me, who am full of woes! Not while I live shall my sighs cease For her in whom my heart found peace: I am become like unto those That cannot sleep for weariness, Now I have lost my crimson rose. And yet I will not call her lost; She is not gone out of the earth; She is but girded with a girth Of hate, that clips her in like frost. Thus says she every hour almost:— “When I was born, 'twas an ill birth! O that I never had been born, If I am still to fall asleep Weeping, and when I wake to weep; If he whom I most loathe and scorn Is still to have me his, and keep Smiling about me night and morn! “O that I never had been born A woman! a poor, helpless fool, Who can but stoop beneath the rule Of him she needs must loathe and scorn! If ever I feel less forlorn, I stand all day in fear and dule, Lest he discern it, and with rough Speech mock at me, or with his smile So hard you scarce could call it guile: No man is there to say, ‘Enough.’ O, but if God waits a long while, Death cannot always stand aloof! “Thou, God the Lord, dost know all this: Give me a little comfort then, Him who is worst among bad men Smite thou for me. Those limbs of his Once hidden where the sharp worm is, Perhaps I might see hope again. Yet for a certain period Would I seem like as one that saith Strange things for grief, and murmureth With smitten palms and hair abroad: Still whispering under my held breath, ‘Shall I not praise Thy name, O God?’ “Thou, God the Lord, dost know all this: It is a very weary thing Thus to be always trembling: And till the breath of his life cease, The hate in him will but increase, And with his hate my suffering. Each morn I hear his voice bid them That watch me, to be faithful spies Lest I go forth and see the skies; Each night, to each, he saith the same:— And in my soul and in mine eyes There is a burning heat like flame.” Thus grieves she now: but she shall wear This love of mine, whereof I spoke, About her body for a cloak, And for a garland in her hair, Even yet: because I mean to prove, Not to speak only, this my love. ENZO, KING OF SARDINIA Sonnet On the Fitness of Seasons There is a time to mount; to humble thee A time; a time to talk, and hold thy peace; A time to labour, and a time to cease; A time to take thy measures patiently; A time to watch what Time's next step may be; A time to make light count of menaces, And to think over them a time there is; There is a time when to seem not to see. Wherefore I hold him well-advised and sage Who evermore keeps prudence facing him, And lets his life slide with occasion; And so comports himself, through youth to age, That never any man at any time Can say, Not thus, but thus thou shouldst have done. GUIDO GUINICELLI I Sonnet Concerning Lucy When Lucy draws her mantle round her face, So sweeter than all else she is to see, That hence unto the hills there lives not he Whose whole soul would not love her for her grace. Then seems she like a daughter of some race That holds high rule in France or Germany: And a snake's head stricken off suddenly Throbs never as then throbs my heart to embrace Her body in these arms, even were she loth;— To kiss her lips, to kiss her cheeks, to kiss The lids of her two eyes which are two flames. Yet what my heart so longs for, my heart blames: For surely sorrow might be bred from this Where some man's patient love abides its growth. II Canzone Of the Gentle Heart Within the gentle heart Love shelters him As birds within the green shade of the grove. Before the gentle heart, in nature's scheme, Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love. For with the sun, at once, So sprang the light immediately; nor was Its birth before the sun's. And Love hath his effect in gentleness Of very self; even as Within the middle fire the heat's excess. The fire of Love comes to the gentle heart Like as its virtue to a precious stone; To which no star its influence can impart Till it is made a pure thing by the sun: For when the sun hath smit From out its essence that which there was vile, The star endoweth it. And so the heart created by God's breath Pure, true, and clean from guile, A woman, like a star, enamoureth. In gentle heart Love for like reason is For which the lamp's high flame is fanned and bow'd: Clear, piercing bright, it shines for its own bliss; Nor would it burn there else, it is so proud. For evil natures meet With Love as it were water met with fire, As cold abhorring heat. Through gentle heart Love doth a track divine,— Like knowing like; the same As diamond runs through iron in the mine. The sun strikes full upon the mud all day: It remains vile, nor the sun's worth is less. “By race I am gentle,” the proud man doth say: He is the mud, the sun is gentleness. Let no man predicate That aught the name of gentleness should have, Even in a King's estate, Except the heart there be a gentle man's. The star-beam lights the wave,— Heaven holds the star and the star's radiance. God, in the understanding of high Heaven, Burns more than in our sight the living sun: There to behold His face unveiled is given; And Heaven, whose will is homage paid to One Fulfils the things which live In God, from the beginning excellent. So should my lady give That truth which in her eyes is glorified, On which her heart is bent, To me whose service waiteth at her side. My lady, God shall ask, “What daredst thou?” (When my soul stands with all her acts review'd;) “Thou passedst Heaven, into My sight, as now, To make Me of vain love similitude. To Me doth praise belong, And to the Queen of all the realm of grace Who slayeth fraud and wrong.” Then may I plead: “As though from Thee he came, Love wore an angel's face: Lord, if I loved her, count it not my shame.” III Sonnet He will praise his Lady Yea, let me praise my lady whom I love: Likening her unto the lily and rose: Brighter than morning star her visage glows; She is beneath even as her Saint above; She is as the air in summer which God wove Of purple and of vermilion glorious; As gold and jewels richer than man knows. Love's self, being love for her, must holier prove. Ever as she walks she hath a sober grace, Making bold men abashed and good men glad; If she delight thee not, thy heart must err. No man dare look on her, his thoughts being base: Nay, let me say even more than I have said;— No man could think base thoughts who looked on her. IV Canzone He perceives his Rashness in Love, but has no choice I hold him, verily, of mean emprise, Whose rashness tempts a strength too great to bear; As I have done, alas! who turned mine eyes Upon those perilous eyes of the most fair. Unto her eyes I bow'd; No need her other beauties in that hour Should aid them, cold and proud: As when the vassals of a mighty lord, What time he needs his power, Are all girt round him to make strong his sword. With such exceeding force the stroke was dealt That by mine eyes its path might not be stay'd; But deep into the heart it pierced, which felt The pang of the sharp wound, and waxed afraid; Then rested in strange wise, As when some creature utterly outworn Sinks into bed and lies. And she the while doth in no manner care, But goes her way in scorn, Beholding herself alway proud and fair. And she may be as proud as she shall please, For she is still the fairest woman found: A sun she seems among the rest; and these Have all their beauties in her splendour drown'd. In her is every grace,— Simplicity of wisdom, noble speech, Accomplished loveliness; All earthly beauty is her diadem, This truth my song would teach,— My lady is of ladies chosen gem. Love to my lady's service yieldeth me,— Will I, or will I not, the thing is so,— Nor other reason can I say or see, Except that where it lists the wind doth blow. He rules and gives no sign; Nor once from her did show of love upbuoy This passion which is mine. It is because her virtue's strength and stir So fill her full of joy That I am glad to die for love of her. V Sonnet Of Moderation and Tolerance He that has grown to wisdom hurries not, But thinks and weighs what Reason bids him do; And after thinking he retains his thought Until as he conceived the fact ensue. Let no man to o'erweening pride be wrought, But count his state as Fortune's gift and due. He is a fool who deems that none has sought The truth, save he alone, or knows it true. Many strange birds are on the air abroad, Nor all are of one flight or of one force, But each after his kind dissimilar: To each was portioned of the breath of God, Who gave them divers instincts from one source. Then judge not thou thy fellows what they are. VI Sonnet Of Human Presumption Among my thoughts I count it wonderful, How foolishness in man should be so rife That masterly he takes the world to wife As though no end were set unto his rule: In labour alway that his ease be full, As though there never were another life; Till Death throws all his order into strife, And round his head his purposes doth pull. And evermore one sees the other die, And sees how all conditions turn to change, Yet in no wise may the blind wretch be heal'd. I therefore say, that sin can even estrange Man's very sight, and his heart satisfy To live as lives a sheep upon the field. GUERZO DI MONTECANTI Sonnet He is out of heart with his Time If any man would know the very cause Which makes me to forget my speech in rhyme, All the sweet songs I sang in other time,— I'll tell it in a sonnet's simple clause. I hourly have beheld how good withdraws To nothing, and how evil mounts the while: Until my heart is gnawed as with a file, Nor aught of this world's worth is what it was. At last there is no other remedy But to behold the universal end; And so upon this hope my thoughts are urged: To whom, since truth is sunk and dead at sea, There has no other part or prayer remain'd, Except of seeing the world's self submerged. INGHILFREDI, SICILIANO Canzone He rebukes the Evil of that Time Hard is it for a man to please all men: I therefore speak in doubt, And as one may that looketh to be chid. But who can hold his peace in these days?—when Guilt cunningly slips out, And Innocence atones for what he did; When worth is crushed, even if it be not hid; When on crushed worth, guile sets his foot to rise; And when the things wise men have counted wise Make fools to smile and stare and lift the lid. Let none who have not wisdom govern you: For he that was a fool At first shall scarce grow wise under the sun. And as it is, my whole heart bleeds anew To think how hard a school Young hope grows old at, as these seasons run. Behold, sirs, we have reached this thing for one:— The lord before his servant bends the knee, And service puts on lordship suddenly. Ye speak o'the end? Ye have not yet begun. I would not have ye without counsel ta'en Follow my words; nor meant, If one should talk and act not, to praise him But who, being much opposed, speaks not again, Confesseth himself shent And put to silence,—by some loud-mouthed mime, Perchance, for whom I speak not in this rhyme. Strive what ye can; and if ye cannot all, Yet should not your hearts fall: The fruit commends the flower in God's good time. (For without fruit, the flower delights not God): Wherefore let him whom Hope Puts off, remember time is not gone by. Let him say calmly: “Thus far on this road A foolish trust buoyed up My soul, and made it like the summer fly Burned in the flame it seeks: even so was I: But now I'll aid myself: for still this trust, I find, falleth to dust: The fish gapes for the bait-hook, and doth die.” And yet myself, who bid ye do this thing,— Am I not also spurn'd By the proud feet of Hope continually; Till that which gave me such good comforting Is altogether turn'd Unto a fire whose heat consumeth me? I am so girt with grief that my thoughts be Tired of themselves, and from my soul I loathe Silence and converse both; And my own face is what I hate to see. Because no act is meet now nor unmeet. He that does evil, men applaud his name, And the well-doer must put up with shame: Yea, and the worst man sits in the best seat. RINALDO D'AQUINO I Canzone He is resolved to be joyful in Love A thing is in my mind,— To have my joy again, Which I had almost put away from me. It were in foolish kind For ever to refrain From song, and renounce gladness utterly. Seeing that I am given into the rule Of Love, whom only pleasure makes alive, Whom pleasure nourishes and brings to growth: The wherefore sullen sloth Will he not suffer in those serving him; But pleasant they must seem, That good folk love them and their service thrive; Nor even their pain must make them sorrowful. So bear he him that thence The praise of men be gain'd,— He that would put his hope in noble Love; For by great excellence Alone can be attain'd That amorous joy which wisdom may approve. The way of Love is this, righteous and just; Then whoso would be held of good account, To seek the way of Love must him befit,— Pleasure, to wit. Through pleasure, man attains his worthiness: For he must please All men, so bearing him that Love may mount In their esteem; Love's self being in his trust. Trustful in servitude I have been and will be, And loyal unto Love my whole life through. A hundred-fold of good Hath he not guerdoned me For what I have endured of grief and woe? Since he hath given me unto one of whom Thus much he said—thou mightest seek for aye Another of such worth so beauteous. Joy therefore may keep house In this my heart, that it hath loved so well. Meseems I scarce could dwell Ever in weary life or in dismay If to true service still my heart gave room. Serving at her pleasaùnce Whose service pleasureth, I am enriched with all the wealth of Love. Song hath no utterance For my life's joyful breath Since in this lady's grace my homage throve. Yea, for I think it would be difficult One should conceive my former abject case:— Therefore have knowledge of me from this rhyme. My penance-time Is all accomplished now, and all forgot, So that no jot Do I remember of mine evil days. It is my lady's will that I exult. Exulting let me take My joyful comfort, then, Seeing myself in so much blessedness. Mine ease even as mine ache Accepting, let me gain No pride towards Love; but with all humbleness, Even still, my pleasurable service pay. For a good servant ne'er was left to pine: Great shall his guerdon be who greatly bears. But, because he that fears To speak too much, by his own silence shent, Hath sometimes made lament,— I am thus boastful, lady; being thine For homage and obedience night and day. II Canzone A Lady, in Spring, repents of her Coldness Now, when it flowereth, And when the banks and fields Are greener every day, And sweet is each bird's breath, In the tree where he builds Singing after his way,— Spring comes to us with hasty step and brief, Everywhere in leaf, And everywhere makes people laugh and play. Love is brought unto me In the scent of the flower And in the bird's blithe noise. When day begins to be, I hear in every bower New verses finding voice: From every branch around me and above, A minstrels' court of love, The birds contend in song about love's joys. What time I hear the lark And nightingale keep Spring, My heart will pant and yearn For love. (Ye all may mark The unkindly comforting Of fire that will not burn.) And, being in the shadow of the fresh wood, How excellently good A thing love is, I cannot choose but learn. Let me ask grace; for I, Being loved, loved not again. Now springtime makes me love, And bids me satisfy The lover whose fierce pain I thought too lightly of: For that the pain is fierce I do feel now. And yet this pride is slow To free my heart, which pity would fain move. Wherefore I pray thee, Love, That thy breath turn me o'er, Even as the wind a leaf; And I will set thee above This heart of mine, that's sore Perplexed, to be its chief. Let also the dear youth, whose passion must Henceforward have good trust, Be happy without words; for words bring grief. JACOPO DA LENTINO I Sonnet Of his Lady in Heaven I have it in my heart to serve God so That into Paradise I shall repair,— The holy place through the which everywhere I have heard say that joy and solace flow. Without my lady I were loth to go,— She who has the bright face and the bright hair; Because if she were absent, I being there, My pleasure would be less than nought, I know. Look you, I say not this to such intent As that I there would deal in any sin: I only would behold her gracious mien, And beautiful soft eyes, and lovely face, That so it should be my complete content To see my lady joyful in her place. II Canzonetta Of his Lady, and her Portrait Marvellously elate, Love makes my spirit warm With noble sympathies: As one whose mind is set Upon some glorious form, To paint it as it is;— I verily who bear Thy face at heart, most fair, Am like to him in this. Not outwardly declared, Within me dwells enclosed Thine image as thou art. Ah! strangely hath it fared! I know not if thou know'st The love within my heart. Exceedingly afraid, My hope I have not said, But gazed on thee apart. Because desire was strong, I made a portraiture In thine own likeness, love: When absence has grown long, I gaze, till I am sure That I behold thee move; As one who purposeth To save himself by faith, Yet sees not, nor can prove. Then comes the burning pain: As with the man that hath A fire within his breast,— When most he struggles, then Most boils the flame in wrath, And will not let him rest, So still I burned and shook, To pass, and not to look In thy face, loveliest. For where thou art I pass, And do not lift mine eyes, Lady, to look on thee: But, as I go, alas! With bitterness of sighs I mourn exceedingly. Alas! the constant woe! Myself I do not know, So sore it troubles me. And I have sung thy praise, Lady, and many times Have told thy beauties o'er. Hast heard in anyways, Perchance, that these my rhymes Are song-craft and no more? Nay, rather deem, when thou Shalt see me pass and bow, These words I sicken for. Delicate song of mine, Go sing thou a new strain: Seek, with the first sunshine, Our lady, mine and thine,— The rose of Love's domain, Than red gold comelier. “Lady, in Love's name hark To Jacopo the clerk, Born in Lentino here.” III Sonnet No Jewel is worth his Lady Sapphire, nor diamond, nor emerald, Nor other precious stones past reckoning, Topaz, nor pearl, nor ruby like a king, Nor that most virtuous jewel, jasper call'd, Nor amethyst, nor onyx, nor basalt, Each counted for a very marvellous thing, Is half so excellently gladdening As is my lady's head uncoronall'd. All beauty by her beauty is made dim; Like to the stars she is for loftiness; And with her voice she taketh away grief. She is fairer than a bud, or than a leaf. Christ have her well in keeping, of His grace, And make her holy and beloved, like Him! IV Canzonetta He will neither boast nor lament to his Lady Love will not have me cry For grace, as others do; Nor as they vaunt, that I Should vaunt my love to you. For service, such as all Can pay, is counted small; Nor is it much to praise The thing which all must know;— Such pittance to bestow On you my love gainsays. Love lets me not turn shape As chance or use may strike; As one may see an ape Counterfeit all alike. Then, lady, unto you Be it not mine to sue For grace or pitying. Many the lovers be That of such suit are free,— It is a common thing. A gem, the more 'tis rare, The more its cost will mount: And, be it not so fair, It is of more account. So, coming from the East, The sapphire is increased In worth, though scarce so bright; I therefore seek thy face Not to solicit grace, Being cheapened and made slight. So is the colosmine Now cheapened, which in fame Was once so brave and fine, But now is a mean gem. So be such prayers for grace Not heard in any place; Would they indeed hold fast Their worth, be they not said, Nor by true lovers made Before nine years be past. Lady, sans sigh or groan, My longing thou canst see; Much better am I known Than to myself, to thee. And is there nothing else That in my heart avails For love but groan and sigh? And wilt thou have it thus, This love betwixen us?— Much rather let me die. V Canzonetta Of his Lady, and of his making her Likeness My Lady mine, Madonna mia. I send These sighs in joy to thee; Though, loving till the end, There were no hope for me That I should speak my love; And I have loved indeed, Though, having fearful heed, It was not spoken of. Thou art so high and great That whom I love I fear; Which thing to circumstate I have no messenger: Wherefore to Love I pray, On whom each lover cries, That these my tears and sighs Find unto thee a way. Well have I wished, when I At heart with sighs have ach'd, That there were in each sigh Spirit and intellect, The which, where thou dost sit, Should kneel and sue for aid, Since I am thus afraid And have no strength for it. Thou, lady, killest me, Yet keepest me in pain, For thou must surely see How, fearing, I am fain. Ah! why not send me still Some solace, small and slight, So that I should not quite Despair of thy good will? Thy grace, all else above, Even now while I implore, Enamoureth my love To love thee still the more. Yet scarce should I know well— A greater love to gain, Even if a greater pain, Lady, were possible. Joy did that day relax My grief's continual stress, When I essayed in wax Thy beauty's life-likeness. Ah! much more beautiful Than golden-haired Yseult,— Who mak'st all men exult, Who bring'st all women dule. And certes without blame Thy love might fall to me, Though it should chance my name Were never heard of thee. Yea, for thy love, in fine, Lentino gave me birth, Who am not nothing worth If worthy to be thine. VI Sonnet Of his Lady's face Her face has made my life most proud and glad; Her face has made my life quite wearisome; It comforts me when other troubles come, And amid other joys it strikes me sad. Truly I think her face can drive me mad; For now I am too loud, and anon dumb. There is no second face in Christendom Has a like power, nor shall have, nor has had. What man in living face has seen such eyes, Or such a lovely bending of the head, Or mouth that opens to so sweet a smile? In speech, my heart before her faints and dies, And into Heaven seems to be spirited; So that I count me blest a certain while. VII Canzone At the end of his Hope Remembering this—how Love Mocks me, and bids me hoard Mine ill reward that keeps me nigh to death,— How it doth still behove I suffer the keen sword, Whence undeplor'd I may not draw my breath; In memory of this thing Sighing and sorrowing, I am languid at the heart For her to whom I bow, Craving her pity now, And who still turns apart. I am dying, and through her— This flower, from paradise Sent in some wise, that I might have no rest. Truly she did not err To come before his eyes Who fails and dies, by her sweet smile possess'd; For, through her countenance (Fair brows and lofty glance!) I live in constant dule. Of lovers' hearts the chief For sorrow and much grief, My heart is sorrowful. For Love has made me weep With sighs that do him wrong, Since, when most strong my joy, he gave this woe. I am broken, as a ship Perishing of the song, Sweet, sweet and long, the songs the sirens know. The mariner forgets, Voyaging in those straits, And dies assuredly. Yea, from her pride perverse, Who hath my heart as hers, Even such my death must be. I deemed her not so fell And hard but she would greet, From her high seat, at length, the love I bring; For I have loved her well;— Nor that her face so sweet In so much heat would keep me languishing; Seeing that she I serve All honour doth deserve For worth unparallel'd. Yet what availeth moan But for more grief alone? O God! that it avail'd! Thou, my new song, shalt pray To her, who for no end Each day doth tend her virtues that they grow,— Since she to love saith nay;— (More charms she had attain'd Than sea hath sand, and wisdom even so);— Pray thou to her that she For my love pity me, Since with my love I burn,— That of the fruit of love, While help may come thereof, She give to me in turn. MAZZEO DI RICCO, DA MESSINA I Canzone He solicits his Lady's Pity The lofty worth and lovely excellence, Dear lady, that thou hast, Hold me consuming in the fire of love: That I am much afeared and wildered thence, As who, being meanly plac'd, Would win unto some height he dreameth of. Yet, if it be decreed, After the multiplying of vain thought, By Fortune's favour he at last is brought To his far hope, the mighty bliss indeed. Thus, in considering thy loveliness, Love maketh me afear'd,— So high art thou, joyful, and full of good;— And all the more, thy scorn being never less. Yet is this comfort heard,— That underneath the water fire doth brood, Which thing would seem unfit By law of nature. So may thy scorn prove Changed at the last, through pity into love, If favourable Fortune should permit. Lady, though I do love past utterance, Let it not seem amiss, Neither rebuke thou the enamoured eyes. Look thou thyself on thine own countenance, From that charm unto this, All thy perfections of sufficiencies. So shalt thou rest assured That thine exceeding beauty lures me on Perforce, as by the passive magnet-stone The needle, of its nature's self, is lured. Certes, it was of Love's dispiteousness That I must set my life On thee, proud lady, who accept'st it not. And how should I attain unto thy grace, That falter, thus at strife To speak to thee the thing which is my thought? Thou, lovely as thou art, I pray for God, when thou dost pass me by, Look upon me: so shalt thou certify, By my cheek's ailing, that which ails my heart. So thoroughly my love doth tend toward Thy love its lofty scope, That I may never think to ease my pain; Because the ice, when it is frozen hard, May have no further hope That it should ever become snow again. But, since Love bids me bend Unto thy seigniory, Have pity thou on me, That so upon thyself all grace descend. II Canzone After Six Years' service he renounces his Lady I Laboured these six years For thee, thou bitter sweet; Yea, more than it is meet That speech should now rehearse Or song should rhyme to thee; But love gains never aught From thee, by depth or length; Unto thine eyes such strength And calmness thou hast taught, That I say wearily:— “The child is most like me, Who thinks in the clear stream To catch the round flat moon And draw it all a-dripping unto him,— Who fancies he can take into his hand The flame o'the lamp, but soon Screams and is nigh to swoon At the sharp heat his flesh may not withstand.” Though it be late to learn How sore I was possest, Yet do I count me blest, Because I still can spurn This thrall which is so mean. For when a man, once sick, Has got his health anew, The fever which boiled through His veins, and made him weak, Is as it had not been. For all that I had seen, Thy spirit, like thy face, More excellently shone Than precious crystals in an untrod place. Go to: thy worth is but as glass, the cheat, Which, to gaze thereupon, Seems crystal, even as one, But only is a cunning counterfeit. Foiled hope has made me mad, As one who, playing high, Thought to grow rich thereby, And loses what he had. Yet I can now perceive How true the saying is That says: “If one turn back Out of an evil track Through loss which has been his, He gains, and need not grieve.” To me now, by your leave, It chances as to him Who of his purse is free To one whose memory for such debts is dim. Long time he speaks no word thereof, being loth: But having asked, when he Is answered slightingly, Then shall he lose his patience and be wroth. III Sonnet Of Self-seeing If any his own foolishness might see As he can see his fellow's foolishness, His evil speakings could not but prove less, For his own fault would vex him inwardly. But, by old custom, each man deems that he Has to himself all this world's worthiness; And thou, perchance, in blind contentedness, Scorn'st him, yet know'st not what I think of thee. Wherefore I wish it were so ordered That each of us might know the good that's his, And also the ill,—his honour and his shame. For oft a man has on his proper head Such weight of sins, that, did he know but this, He could not for his life give others blame. PANNUCCIO DAL BAGNO, PISANO Canzone Of his Change through Love My lady, thy delightful high command, Thy wisdom's great intent, The worth which ever rules thee in thy sway, (Whose righteousness of strength hath ta'en in hand Such full accomplishment As height makes worthy of more height alway,) Have granted to thy servant some poor due Of thy perfection; who From them has gained a proper will so fix'd, With other thought unmix'd, That nothing save thy service now impels His life, and his heart longs for nothing else. Beneath thy pleasure, lady mine, I am: The circuit of my will, The force of all my life, to serve thee so: Never but only this I think or name, Nor ever can I fill My heart with other joy that man may know. And hence a sovereign blessedness I draw, Who soon most clearly saw That not alone my perfect pleasure is In this my life-service: But Love has made my soul with thine to touch Till my heart feels unworthy of so much. For all that I could strive, it were not worth That I should be uplift Into thy love, as certainly I know: Since one to thy deserving should stretch forth His love for a free gift, And be full fain to serve and sit below. And forasmuch as this is verity, It came to pass with thee That seeing how my love was not loud-tongued Yet for thy service long'd— As only thy pure wisdom brought to pass,— Thou knew'st my heart for only what it was. Also because thou thus at once didst learn This heart of mine and thine, With all its love for thee, which was and is; Thy lofty sense that could so well discern Wrought even in me some sign Of thee, and of itself some emphasis, Which evermore might hold my purpose fast. For lo! thy law is pass'd That this my love should manifestly be To serve and honour thee: And so I do: and my delight is full, Accepted for the servant of thy rule. Without almost, I am all rapturous, Since thus my will was set To serve, thou flower of joy, thine excellence: Nor ever seems it anything could rouse A pain or a regret, But on thee dwells mine every thought and sense; Considering that from thee all virtues spread As from a fountain-head,— That in thy gift is wisdom's best avail And honour without fail; With whom each sovereign good dwells separate, Fulfilling the perfection of thy state. Lady, since I conceived Thy pleasurable aspect in my heart, My life has been apart In shining brightness and the place of truth; Which till that time, good sooth, Groped among shadows in a darken'd place Where many hours and days It hardly ever had remembered good. But now my servitude Is thine, and I am full of joy and rest. A man from a wild beast Thou madest me, since for thy love I lived. GIACOMINO PUGLIESI, KNIGHT OF PRATO I Canzonetta Of his Lady in Absence The sweetly-favoured face She has, and her good cheer, Have filled me full of grace When I have walked with her. They did upon that day: And everything that pass'd Comes back from first to last Now that I am away. There went from her meek mouth A poor low sigh which made My heart sink down for drouth. She stooped, and sobbed, and said, “Sir, I entreat of you Make little tarrying: It is not a good thing To leave one's love and go.” But when I turned about Saying, “God keep you well!” As she look'd up, I thought Her lips that were quite pale Strove much to speak, but she Had not half strength enough: My own dear graceful love Would not let go of me. I am not so far, sweet maid, That now the old love's unfelt: I believe Tristram had No such love for Yseult: And when I see your eyes And feel your breath again, I shall forget this pain And my whole heart will rise. II Canzonetta To his Lady, in Spring To see the green returning To stream-side, garden, and meadow,— To hear the birds give warning, (The laughter of sun and shadow Awaking them full of revel,) It puts me in strength to carol A music measured and level, This grief in joy to apparel; For the deaths of lovers are evil. Love is a foolish riot, And to be loved is a burden; Who loves and is loved in quiet Has all the world for his guerdon. Ladies on him take pity Who for their sake hath trouble: Yet, if any heart be a city From love embarrèd double, Thereof is a joyful ditty. That heart shall be always joyful;— But I in the heart, my lady, Have jealous doubts unlawful, And stubborn pride stands ready. Yet love is not with a measure, But still is willing to suffer Service at his good pleasure: The whole Love hath to offer Tends to his perfect treasure. Thine be this prelude-music That was of thy commanding; Thy gaze was not delusive,— Of my heart thou hadst understanding. Lady, by thine attemp'rance Thou heldst my life from pining: This tress thou gav'st, in semblance Like gold of the third refining, Which I do keep for remembrance. III Canzone Of his dead Lady Death, why hast thou made life so hard to bear, Taking my lady hence? Hast thou no whit Of shame? The youngest flower and the most fair Thou hast plucked away, and the world wanteth it. O leaden Death, hast thou no pitying? Our warm love's very spring Thou stopp'st, and endest what was holy and meet; And of my gladdening Mak'st a most woful thing, And in my heart dost bid the bird not sing That sang so sweet. Once the great joy and solace that I had Was more than is with other gentlemen:— Now is my love gone hence, who made me glad. With her that hope I lived in she hath ta'en And left me nothing but these sighs and tears,— Nothing of the old years That come not back again, Wherein I was so happy, being hers. Now to mine eyes her face no more appears, Nor doth her voice make music in mine ears, As it did then. O God, why hast thou made my grief so deep? Why set me in the dark to grope and pine? Why parted me from her companionship, And crushed the hope which was a gift of thine? To think, dear, that I never any more Can see thee as before! Who is it shuts thee in? Who hides that smile for which my heart is sore, And drowns those words that I am longing for, Lady of mine? Where is my lady, and the lovely face She had, and the sweet motion when she walk'd?— Her chaste, mild favour—her so delicate grace— Her eyes, her mouth, and the dear way she talk'd?— Her courteous bending—her most noble air— The soft fall of her hair? . . . . My lady—she who to my soul so rare A gladness brought! Now I do never see her anywhere, And may not, looking in her eyes, gain there The blessing which I sought. So if I had the realm of Hungary, With Greece, and all the Almayn even to France, Or Saint Sophia's treasure-hoard, you see All could not give me back her countenance. For since the day when my dear lady died From us, (with God being born and glorified,) No more pleasaunce Her image bringeth, seated at my side, But only tears. Ay me! the strength and pride Which it brought once. Had I my will, beloved, I would say To God, unto whose bidding all things bow, That we were still together night and day: Yet be it done as His behests allow. I do remember that while she remain'd With me, she often called me her sweet friend; But does not now, Because God drew her towards Him, in the end. Lady, that peace which none but He can send Be thine. Even so. FRA GUITTONE D' AREZZO Sonnet To the Blessed Virgin Mary Lady of Heaven, the mother glorified Of glory, which is Jesus,—He whose death Us from the gates of Hell delivereth And our first parents' error sets aside:— Behold this earthly Love, how his darts glide— How sharpened—to what fate—throughout this earth! Pitiful Mother, partner of our birth, Win these from following where his flight doth guide. And O, inspire in me that holy love Which leads the soul back to its origin, Till of all other love the link do fail. This water only can this fire reprove,— Only such cure suffice for suchlike sin; As nail from out a plank is struck by nail. BARTOLOMEO DI SANT' ANGELO Sonnet He jests concerning his Poverty I am so passing rich in poverty That I could furnish forth Paris and Rome, Pisa and Padua and Byzantium, Venice and Lucca, Florence and Forli; For I possess in actual specie, Of nihil and of nothing a great sum; And unto this my hoard whole shiploads come, What between nought and zero, annually. In gold and precious jewels I have got A hundred ciphers' worth, all roundly writ; And therewithal am free to feast my friend. Because I need not be afraid to spend, Nor doubt the safety of my wealth a whit:— No thief will ever steal thereof, God wot. SALADINO DA PAVIA Dialogue Lover and Lady She Fair sir, this love of ours, In joy begun so well, I see at length to fail upon thy part: Wherefore my heart sinks very heavily. Fair sir, this love of ours Began with amorous longing, well I ween: Yea, of one mind, yea, of one heart and will This love of ours hath been. Now these are sad and still; For on thy part at length it fails, I see. And now thou art gone from me, Quite lost to me thou art; Wherefore my heart in this pain languisheth, Which sinks it unto death thus heavily. He Lady, for will of mine Our love had never changed in anywise, Had not the choice been thine With so much scorn my homage to despise. I swore not to yield sign Of holding 'gainst all hope my heart-service. Nay, let thus much suffice:— From thee whom I have serv'd, All undeserved contempt is my reward,— Rich prize prepar'd to guerdon fealty!She Fair sir, it oft is found That ladies who would try their lovers so, Have for a season frown'd, Not from their heart but in mere outward show. Then chide not on such ground, Since ladies oft have tried their lovers so. Alas, but I will go, If now it be thy will. Yet turn thee still, alas! for I do fear Thou lov'st elsewhere, and therefore fly'st from me.He Lady, there needs no doubt Of my good faith, nor any nice suspense Lest love be elsewhere sought. For thine did yield me no such recompense,— Rest thou assured in thought,— That now, within my life's circumference, I should not quite dispense My heart from woman's laws, Which for no cause give pain and sore annoy, And for one joy a world of misery. BONAGGIUNTA URBICIANI, DA LUCCA I Canzone Of the true End of Love; with a Prayer to his Lady Never was joy or good that did not soothe And beget glorying, Neither a glorying without perfect love. Wherefore, if one would compass of a truth The flight of his soul's wing, To bear a loving heart must him behove. Since from the flower man still expects the fruit, And, out of love, that he desireth; Seeing that by good faith Alone hath love its comfort and its joy; For, suffering falsehood, love were at the root Dead of all worth, which living must aspire; Nor could it breed desire If its reward were less than its annoy. Even such the joy, the triumph, and pleasaunce, Whose issue honour is, And grace, and the most delicate teaching sent To amorous knowledge, its inheritance; Because Love's properties Alter not by a true accomplishment; But it were scarcely well if one should gain Without much pain so great a blessedness; He errs, when all things bless, Whose heart had else been humbled to implore. He gets not joy who gives no joy again; Nor can win love whose love hath little scope; Nor fully can know hope Who leaves not of the thing most languished for. Wherefore his choice must err immeasurably Who seeks the image when He might behold the thing substantial. I at the noon have seen dark night to be, Against earth's natural plan, And what was good to worst abasement fall. Then be thus much sufficient, lady mine; If of thy mildness pity may be born, Count thou my grief outworn, And turn into sweet joy this bitter ill; Lest I might change, if left too long to pine: As one who, journeying, in mid path should stay, And not pursue his way, But should go back against his proper will. Natheless I hope, yea trust, to make an end Of the beginning made, Even by this sign—that yet I triumph not. And if in truth, against my will constrain'd, To turn my steps essay'd, No courage have I, neither strength, God wot. Such is Love's rule, who thus subdueth me By thy sweet face, lovely and delicate; Through which I live elate, But in such longing that I die for love. Ah! and these words as nothing seem to be: For love to such a constant fear has chid My heart that I keep hid Much more than I have dared to tell thee of. II Canzonetta How he dreams of his Lady Lady, my wedded thought, When to thy shape 'tis wrought, Can think of nothing else But only of thy grace, And of those gentle ways Wherein thy life excels. For ever, sweet one, dwells Thine image on my sight, (Even as it were the gem Whose name is as thy name) The lady was probably called Diamante, Margherita, or some similar name. (Note to Flor. Ed. 1816). And fills the sense with light. Continual ponderings That brood upon these things Yield constant agony: Yea, the same thoughts have crept About me as I slept. My spirit looks at me, And asks, “Is sleep for thee? Nay, mourner, do not sleep, But fix thine eyes, for lo! Love's fulness thou shalt know By steadfast gaze and deep.” Then, burning, I awake, Sore tempted to partake Of dreams that seek thy sight: Until, being greatly stirr'd, I turn to where I heard That whisper in the night; And there a breath of light Shines like a silver star. The same is mine own soul, Which lures me to the goal Of dreams that gaze afar. But now my sleep is lost; And through this uttermost Sharp longing for thine eyes At length it may be said That I indeed am mad With love's extremities. Yet when in such sweet wise Thou passest and dost smile, My heart so fondly burns, That unto sweetness turns Its bitter pang the while. Even so Love rends apart My spirit and my heart, Lady, in loving thee; Till when I see thee now, Life beats within my brow And would be gone from me. So hear I ceaselessly, Love's whisper well fulfill'd— Even I am he, even so, Whose flame thy heart doth know: And while I strive I yield. III Sonnet Of Wisdom and Foresight Such wisdom as a little child displays Were not amiss in certain lords of fame: For where he fell, thenceforth he shuns the place, And having suffered blows, he feareth them. Who knows not this may forfeit all he sways At length, and find his friends go as they came. O therefore on the past time turn thy face, And, if thy will do err, forget the same. Because repentance brings not back the past: Better thy will should bend than thy life break: Who owns not this, by him shall it appear. And, because even from fools the wise may make Wisdom, the first should count himself the last, Since a dog scourged can bid the lion fear. IV Sonnet Of Continence in Speech Whoso abandons peace for war-seeking, 'Tis of all reason he should bear the smart. Whoso hath evil speech, his medicine Is silence, lest it seem a hateful art. To vex the wasps' nest is not a wise thing; Yet who rebukes his neighbour in good part, A hundred years shall show his right therein. Too prone to fear, one wrongs another's heart. If ye but knew what may be known to me, Ye would fall sorry sick, nor be thus bold To cry among your fellows your ill thought. Wherefore I would that every one of ye Who thinketh ill, his ill thought should withhold: If that ye would not hear it, speak it not. MEO ABBRACCIAVACCA, DA PISTOIA I Canzone He will be silent and watchful in his Love Your joyful understanding, lady mine, Those honours of fair life Which all in you agree to pleasantness, Long since to service did my heart assign; That never it has strife, Nor once remembers other means of grace; But this desire alone gives light to it. Behold, my pleasure, by your favour, drew Me, lady, unto you, All beauty's and all joy's reflection here: From whom good women also have thought fit To take their life's example every day; Whom also to obey My wish and will have wrought, with love and fear. With love and fear to yield obedience, I Might never half deserve: Yet you must know, merely to look on me, How my heart holds its love and lives thereby; Though, well intent to serve, It can accept Love's arrow silently. 'Twere late to wait, ere I would render plain My heart, (thus much I tell you, as I should,) Which, to be understood, Craves therefore the fine quickness of your glance. So shall you know my love of such high strain As never yet was shown by its own will; Whose proffer is so still, That love in heart hates love in countenance. In countenance oft the heart is evident Full clad in mirth's attire, Wherein at times it overweens to waste: Which yet of selfish joy or foul intent Doth hide the deep desire, And is, of heavy surety, double-faced; Upon things double therefore look ye twice. O ye that love! not what is fair alone Desire to make your own, But a wise woman, fair in purity; Nor think that any, without sacrifice Of his own nature, suffers service still; But out of high free-will; In honour propped, though bowed in dignity. In dignity as best I may, must I The guerdon very grand, The whole of it, secured in purpose, sing? Lady, whom all my heart doth magnify, You took me in your hand, Ah! not ungraced with other guerdoning: For you of your sweet reason gave me rest From yearning, from desire, from potent pain; Till, now, if Death should gain Me to his kingdom, it would pleasure me, Having obeyed the whole of your behest. Since you have drawn, and I am yours by lot, I pray you doubt me not Lest my faith swerve, for this could never be. Could never be; because the natural heart Will absolutely build Her dwelling-place within the gates of truth; And, if it be no grief to bear her part, Why, then by change were fill'd The measure of her shame beyond all truth. And therefore no delay shall once disturb My bounden service, nor bring grief to it; Nor unto you deceit. True virtue her provision first affords, Ere she yield grace, lest afterward some curb Or check should come, and evil enter in: For alway shame and sin Stand covered, ready, full of faithful words. II Ballata His Life is by Contraries By the long sojourning That I have made with grief, I am quite changed, you see;— If I weep, 'tis for glee; I smile at a sad thing; Despair is my relief. Good hap makes me afraid; Ruin seems rest and shade; In May the year is old; With friends I am ill at ease; Among foes I find peace; At noonday I feel cold. The thing that strengthens others, frightens me. If I am grieved, I sing; I chafe at comforting; Ill fortune makes me smile exultingly. And yet, though all my days are thus,—despite A shaken mind, and eyes Which see by contraries,— I know that without wings is an ill flight. UBALDO DI MARCO Sonnet Of a Lady's Love for him My body resting in a haunt of mine, I ranged among alternate memories; What while an unseen noble lady's eyes Were fixed upon me, yet she gave no sign; To stay and go she sweetly did incline, Always afraid lest there were any spies; Then reached to me,—and smelt it in sweet wise, And reached to me—some sprig of bloom or bine. Conscious of perfume, on my side I leant, And rose upon my feet, and gazed around To see the plant whose flower could so beguile. Finding it not, I sought it by the scent; And by the scent, in truth, the plant I found, And rested in its shadow a great while. SIMBUONO GIUDICE Canzone He finds that Love has beguiled him, but will trust in his Lady Often the day had a most joyful morn That bringeth grief at last Unto the human heart which deemed all well: Of a sweet seed the fruit was often born That hath a bitter taste: Of mine own knowledge, oft it thus befell. I say it for myself, who, foolishly Expectant of all joy, Triumphing undertook To love a lady proud and beautiful, For one poor glance vouchsafed in mirth to me: Wherefrom sprang all annoy: For, since the day Love shook My heart, she ever hath been cold and cruel. Well thought I to possess my joy complete When that sweet look of hers I felt upon me, amorous and kind: Now is my hope even underneath my feet. And still the arrow stirs Within my heart—(oh hurt no skill can bind!)— Which through mine eyes found entrance cunningly! In manner as through glass Light pierces from the sun, And breaks it not, but wins its way beyond,— As into an unaltered mirror, free And still, some shape may pass. Yet has my heart begun To break, methinks, for I on death grow fond. But, even though death were longed for, the sharp wound I have might yet be heal'd, And I not altogether sink to death. In mine own foolishness the curse I found, Who foolish faith did yield Unto mine eyes, in hope that sickeneth. Yet might love still exult and not be sad— (For some such utterance Is at my secret heart)— If from herself the cure it could obtain,— Who hath indeed the power Achilles had, To wit, that of his lance The wound could by no art Be closed till it were touched therewith again. So must I needs appeal for pity now From her on her own fault, And in my prayer put meek humility: For certes her much worth will not allow That anything be call'd Treacherousness in such an one as she, In whom is judgment and true excellence. Wherefore I cry for grace; Not doubting that all good, Joy, wisdom, pity, must from her be shed; For scarcely should it deal in death's offence, The so-belovèd face So watched for; rather should All death and ill be thereby subjected. And since, in hope of mercy, I have bent Unto her ordinance Humbly my heart, my body, and my life, Giving her perfect power acknowledgment,— I think some kinder glance She'll deign, and, in mere pity, pause from strife. She surely shall enact the good lord's part: When one whom force compels Doth yield, he is pacified, Forgiving him therein where he did err. Ah! well I know she hath the noble heart Which in the lion quells Obduracy of pride; Whose nobleness is for a crown on her. MASOLINO DA TODI Sonnet Of Work and Wealth A man should hold in very dear esteem The first possession that his labours gain'd; For, though great riches be at length attain'd, From that first mite they were increased to him. Who followeth after his own wilful whim Shall see himself outwitted in the end; Wherefore I still would have him apprehend His fall, who toils not being once supreme. Thou seldom shalt find folly, of the worst, Holding companionship with poverty, Because it is distracted of much care. Howbeit, if one that hath been poor at first Is brought at last to wealth and dignity, Still the worst folly thou shalt find it there. ONESTO DI BONCIMA, BOLOGNESE I Sonnet Of the Last Judgment Upon that cruel season when our Lord Shall come to judge the world eternally; When to no man shall anything afford Peace in the heart, how pure soe'er it be; When heaven shall break asunder at His word, With a great trembling of the earth and sea; When even the just shall fear the dreadful sword,— The wicked crying, “Where shall I cover me?”— When no one angel in His presence stands That shall not be affrighted of that wrath, Except the Virgin Lady, she our guide;— How shall I then escape, whom sin commands? Out and alas on me! There is no path, If in her prayers I be not justified. II Sonnet He wishes that he could meet his Lady alone Whether all grace have failed I scarce may scan, Be it of mere mischance, or art's ill sway, That this-wise, Monday, Tuesday, every day, Afflicts me, through her means, with bale and ban. Now are my days but as a painful span; Nor once “Take heed of dying” did she say. I thank thee for my life thus cast away, Thou who hast wearied out a living man. Yet, oh! my Lord, if I were blest no more Than thus much,—clothed with thy humility, To find her for a single hour alone,— Such perfectness of joy would triumph o'er This grief wherein I waste, that I should be As a new image of Love to look upon. TERINO DA CASTEL FIORENTINO Sonnet To Onesto di Boncima, in Answer to the foregoing If, as thou say'st, thy love tormenteth thee, That thou thereby wast in the fear of death, Messer Onesto, couldst thou bear to be Far from Love's self, and breathing other breath? Nay, thou wouldst pass beyond the greater sea (I do not speak of the Alps, an easy path), For thy life's gladdening; if so to see That light which for my life no comfort hath, But rather makes my grief the bitterer: For I have neither ford nor bridge—no course To reach my lady, or send word to her. And there is not a greater pain, I think, Than to see waters at the limpid source, And to be much athirst, and not to drink. MAESTRO MIGLIORE, DA FIORENZA Sonnet He declares all Love to be Grief Love taking leave, my heart then leaveth me, And is enamour'd even while it would shun; For I have looked so long upon the sun That the sun's glory is now in all I see. To its first will unwilling may not be This heart (though by its will its death be won), Having remembrance of the joy forerun: Yea, all life else seems dying constantly. Ay and alas! in love is no relief, For any man who loveth in full heart, That is not rather grief than gratefulness. Whoso desires it, the beginning is grief; Also the end is grief, most grievous smart; And grief is in the middle, and is call'd grace. DELLO DA SIGNA Ballata His Creed of Ideal Love Prohibiting all hope Of the fulfilment of the joy of love, My lady chose me for her lover still. So am I lifted up To trust her heart which piteous pulses move, Her face which is her joy made visible. Nor have I any fear Lest love and service should be met with scorn, Nor doubt that thus I shall rejoice the more. For ruth is born of prayer; Also, of ruth delicious love is born; And service wrought makes glad the servitor. Behold, I, serving more than others, love One lovely more than all: And, singing and exulting, look for joy There where my homage is for ever paid. And, for I know she does not disapprove If on her grace I call, My soul's good trust I will not yet destroy, Though Love's fulfilment stand prohibited. FOLGORE DA SAN GEMINIANO I Sonnet To the Guelf Faction Because ye made your backs your shields, it came To pass, ye Guelfs, that these your enemies From hares grew lions: and because your eyes Turned homeward, and your spurs e'en did the same, Full many an one who still might win the game In fevered tracts of exile pines and dies. Ye blew your bubbles as the falcon flies, And the wind broke them up and scattered them. This counsel, therefore. Shape your high resolves In good King Robert's humour, See what is said in allusion to his government of Florence by Dante (Parad. C. viii.) and afresh Accept your shames, forgive, and go your way. And so her peace is made with Pisa! Yea, What cares she for the miserable flesh That in the wilderness has fed the wolves? II Sonnet To the Same Were ye but constant, Guelfs, in war or peace, As in divisions ye are constant still! There is no wisdom in your stubborn will, Wherein all good things wane, all harms increase. But each upon his fellow looks, and sees And looks again, and likes his favour ill; And traitors rule ye; and on his own sill Each stirs the fire of household enmities. What, Guelfs! and is Monte Catini The battle of Monte Catini was fought and won by the Ghibelline leader, Uguccione della Faggiola, against the Florentines, August 29, 1315. This would seem to date Folgore's career further on than the period usually assigned to him (about 1260), and the question arises whether the above sonnet be really his. quite Forgot,—where still the mothers and sad wives Keep widowhood, and curse the Ghibellins? O fathers, brothers, yea, all dearest kins! Those men of ye that cherish kindred lives Even once again must set their teeth and fight. III Sonnet Of Virtue The flower of Virtue is the heart's content; And fame is Virtue's fruit that she doth bear; And Virtue's vase is fair without and fair Within; and Virtue's mirror brooks no taint; And Virtue by her names is sage and saint; And Virtue hath a steadfast front and clear; And Love is Virtue's constant minister; And Virtue's gift of gifts is pure descent. And Virtue dwells with knowledge, and therein Her cherished home of rest is real love; And Virtue's strength is in a suffering will; And Virtue's work is life exempt from sin, With arms that aid; and in the sum hereof, All Virtue is to render good for ill. OF THE MONTHS Twelve Sonnets Addressed to a Fellowship of Sienese Nobles This fellowship or club (Brigata), so highly approved and encouraged by our Folgore, is the same to which, and to some of its members by name, scornful allusion is made by Dante (Inferno, C. xxix. l. 130), where he speaks of the hare-brained character of the Sienese. Mr. Cayley, in his valuable notes on Dante, says of it: “A dozen extravagant youths of Siena had put together by equal contributions 216,000 florins to spend in pleasuring; they were reduced in about a twelvemonth to the extremes of poverty. It was their practice to give mutual entertainments twice a-month; at each of which, three tables having been sumptuously covered, they would feast at one, wash their hands on another, and throw the last out of window.” There exists a second curious series of sonnets for the months, addressed also to this club, by Cene della Chitarra d'Arezzo. Here, however, all sorts of disasters and discomforts, in the same pursuits of which Folgore treats, are imagined for the prodigals; each sonnet, too, being composed with the same terminations in its rhymes as the corresponding one among his. They would seem to have been written after the ruin of the club, as a satirical prophecy of the year to succeed the golden one. But this second series, though sometimes laughable, not having the poetical merit of the first, I have not included it. DEDICATION Unto the blithe and lordly Fellowship, (I know not where, but wheresoe'er, I know, Lordly and blithe,) be greeting; and thereto, Dogs, hawks, and a full purse wherein to dip; Quails struck i'the flight; nags mettled to the whip; Hart-hounds, hare-hounds, and blood-hounds even so; And o'er that realm, a crown for Niccolò, Whose praise in Siena springs from lip to lip. Tingoccio, Atuin di Togno, and Ancaiàn, Bartolo and Mugaro and Faënot, Who well might pass for children of King Ban, Courteous and valiant more than Lancelot,— To each, God speed! how worthy every man To hold high tournament in Camelot. JANUARY For January I give you vests of skins, And mighty fires in hall, and torches lit; Chambers and happy beds with all things fit; Smooth silken sheets, rough furry counterpanes; And sweetmeats baked; and one that deftly spins Warm arras; and Douay cloth, and store of it; And on this merry manner still to twit The wind, when most his mastery the wind wins. Or issuing forth at seasons in the day, Ye'll fling soft handfuls of the fair white snow Among the damsels standing round, in play: And when you all are tired and all aglow, Indoors again the court shall hold its sway, And the free Fellowship continue so. FEBRUARY In February I give you gallant sport Of harts and hinds and great wild boars; and all Your company good foresters and tall, With buskins strong, with jerkins close and short; And in your leashes, hounds of brave report; And from your purses, plenteous money-fall, In very spleen of misers' starveling gall, Who at your generous customs snarl and snort. At dusk wend homeward, ye and all your folk, All laden from the wilds, to your carouse, With merriment and songs accompanied: And so draw wine and let the kitchen smoke; And so be till the first watch glorious; Then sound sleep to you till the day be wide. MARCH In March I give you plenteous fisheries Of lamprey and of salmon, eel and trout, Dental and dolphin, sturgeon, all the rout Of fish in all the streams that fill the seas. With fishermen and fishing-boats at ease, Sail-barques and arrow-barques, and galleons stout, To bear you, while the season lasts, far out, And back, through spring, to any port you please. But with fair mansions see that it be fill'd, With everything exactly to your mind, And every sort of comfortable folk. No convent suffer there, nor priestly guild: Leave the mad monks to preach after their kind Their scanty truth, their lies beyond a joke. APRIL I give you meadow-lands in April, fair With over-growth of beautiful green grass; There among fountains the glad hours shall pass, And pleasant ladies bring you solace there. With steeds of Spain and ambling palfreys rare; Provencal songs and dances that surpass; And quaint French mummings; and through hollow brass A sound of German music on the air. And gardens ye shall have, that every one May lie at ease about the fragrant place; And each with fitting reverence shall bow down Unto that youth to whom I gave a crown Of precious jewels like to those that grace The Babylonian Kaiser, Prester John. MAY I give you horses for your games in May, And all of them well trained unto the course,— Each docile, swift, erect, a goodly horse; With armour on their chests, and bells at play Between their brows, and pennons fair and gay; Fine nets, and housings meet for warriors, Emblazoned with the shields ye claim for yours; Gules, argent, or, all dizzy at noonday. And spears shall split, and fruit go flying up In merry counterchange for wreaths that drop From balconies and casements far above; And tender damsels with young men and youths Shall kiss together on the cheeks and mouths; And every day be glad with joyful love. JUNE In June I give you a close-wooded fell, With crowns of thicket coiled about its head, With thirty villas twelve times turreted, All girdling round a little citadel; And in the midst a springhead and fair well With thousand conduits branched and shining speed, Wounding the garden and the tender mead, Yet to the freshened grass acceptable. And lemons, citrons, dates, and oranges, And all the fruits whose savour is most rare, Shall shine within the shadow of your trees; And every one shall be a lover there; Until your life, so filled with courtesies, Throughout the world be counted debonair. JULY For July, in Siena, by the willow-tree, I give you barrels of white Tuscan wine In ice far down your cellars stored supine; And morn and eve to eat in company Of those vast jellies dear to you and me; Of partridges and youngling pheasants sweet, Boiled capons, sovereign kids: and let their treat Be veal and garlic, with whom these agree. Let time slip by, till by-and-by, all day; And never swelter through the heat at all, But move at ease at home, sound, cool, and gay; And wear sweet-coloured robes that lightly fall; And keep your tables set in fresh array, Not coaxing spleen to be your seneschal. AUGUST For August, be your dwelling thirty towers Within an Alpine valley mountainous, Where never the sea-wind may vex your house, But clear life separate, like a star, be yours. There horses shall wait saddled at all hours, That ye may mount at morning or at eve: On each hand either ridge ye shall perceive, A mile apart, which soon a good beast scours. So alway, drawing homewards, ye shall tread Your valley parted by a rivulet Which day and night shall flow sedate and smooth. There all through noon ye may possess the shade, And there your open purses shall entreat The best of Tuscan cheer to feed your youth. SEPTEMBER And in September, O what keen delight! Falcons and astors, merlins, sparrowhawks; Decoy-birds that shall lure your game in flocks; And hounds with bells: and gauntlets stout and tight; Wide pouches; crossbows shooting out of sight; Arblasts and javelins; balls and ball-cases; All birds the best to fly at; moulting these, Those reared by hand; with finches mean and slight; And for their chase, all birds the best to fly; And each to each of you be lavish still In gifts; and robbery find no gainsaying; And if you meet with travellers going by, Their purses from your purse's flow shall fill; And avarice be the only outcast thing. OCTOBER Next, for October, to some sheltered coign Flouting the winds, I'll hope to find you slunk; Though in bird-shooting (lest all sport be sunk), Your foot still press the turf, the horse your groin. At night with sweethearts in the dance you'll join, And drink the blessed must, and get quite drunk. There's no such life for any human trunk; And that's a truth that rings like golden coin! Then, out of bed again when morning's come, Let your hands drench your face refreshingly, And take your physic roast, with flask and knife. Sounder and snugger you shall feel at home Than lake-fish, river-fish, or fish at sea, Inheriting the cream of Christian life. NOVEMBER Let baths and wine-butts be November's due, With thirty mule-loads of broad gold-pieces; And canopy with silk the streets that freeze; And keep your drink-horns steadily in view. Let every trader have his gain of you: Clareta shall your lamps and torches send,— Caëta, citron-candies without end; And each shall drink, and help his neighbour to. And let the cold be great, and the fire grand: And still for fowls, and pastries sweetly wrought, For hares and kids, for roast and boiled, be sure You always have your appetites at hand; And then let night howl and heaven fall, so nought Be missed that makes a man's bed-furniture. DECEMBER Last, for December, houses on the plain, Ground-floors to live in, logs heaped mountain-high, And carpets stretched, and newest games to try, And torches lit, and gifts from man to man: (Your host, a drunkard and a Catalan;) And whole dead pigs, and cunning cooks to ply Each throat with tit-bits that shall satisfy; And wine-butts of Saint Galganus' brave span. And be your coats well-lined and tightly bound, And wrap yourselves in cloaks of strength and weight, With gallant hoods to put your faces through. And make your game of abject vagabond Abandoned miserable reprobate Misers; don't let them have a chance with you. CONCLUSION And now take thought, my sonnet, who is he That most is full of every gentleness; And say to him (for thou shalt quickly guess His name) that all his 'hests are law to me. For if I held fair Paris town in fee, And were not called his friend, 'twere surely less. Ah! had he but the emperor's wealth, my place Were fitted in his love more steadily Than is Saint Francis at Assisi. Alway Commend him unto me and his,—not least To Caian, held so dear in the blithe band. “Folgore da San Geminiano” (say,) “Has sent me, charging me to travel fast, Because his heart went with you in your hand.” OF THE WEEK Seven Sonnets DEDICATION There is among my thoughts the joyous plan To fashion a bright-jewelled carcanet, Which I upon such worthy brows would set, To say, it suits them fairly as it can. And now I have newly found a gentleman, Of courtesies and birth commensurate, Who better would become the imperial state Than fits the gem within the signet's span. Carlo di Messer Guerra Cavicciuoli, That is, according to early Tuscan nomenclature, Carlo, the son of Messer Guerra Cavicciuoli. Of him I speak,—brave, wise, of just award And generous service, let who list command: And lithelier limbed than ounce or lëopard. He holds not money-bags, as children, holy; For Lombard Esté hath no freer hand. MONDAY The Day of Songs and Love Now with the moon the day-star Lucifer Departs, and night is gone at last, and day Brings, making all men's spirits strong and gay, A gentle wind to gladden the new air. Lo! this is Monday, the week's harbinger; Let music breathe her softest matin-lay, And let the loving damsels sing to-day, And the sun wound with heat at noontide here. And thou, young lord, arise and do not sleep, For now the amorous day inviteth thee The harvest of thy lady's youth to reap. Let coursers round the door, and palfreys, be, With squires and pages clad delightfully; And Love's commandments have thou heed to keep. TUESDAY The Day of Battles To a new world on Tuesday shifts my song, Where beat of drum is heard, and trumpet-blast; Where footmen armed and horsemen armed go past, And bells say ding to bells that answer dong; Where he the first and after him the throng, Armed all of them with coats and hoods of steel, Shall see their foes and make their foes to feel, And so in wrack and rout drive them along. Then hither, thither, dragging on the field His master, empty-seated goes the horse, 'Mid entrails strown abroad of soldiers kill'd; Till blow to camp those trumpeters of yours Who noise awhile your triumph and are still'd, And to your tents you come back conquerors. WEDNESDAY The Day of Feasts And every Wednesday, as the swift days move, Pheasant and peacock-shooting out of doors You'll have, and multitude of hares to course, And after you come home, good cheer enough; And sweetest ladies at the board above, Children of kings and counts and senators; And comely-favoured youthful bachelors To serve them, bearing garlands, for true love. And still let cups of gold and silver ware, Runlets of vernage-wine and wine of Greece, Comfits and cakes be found at bidding there; And let your gifts of birds and game increase: And let all those who in your banquet share Sit with bright faces perfectly at ease. THURSDAY The Day of Jousts and Tournaments For Thursday be the tournament prepar'd, And gentlemen in lordly jousts compete: First man with man, together let them meet,— By fifties and by hundreds afterward. Let arms with housings each be fitly pair'd, And fitly hold your battle to its heat From the third hour to vespers, after meat; Till the best-winded be at last declared. Then back unto your beauties, as ye came: Where upon sovereign beds, with wise control Of leaches, shall your hurts be swathed in bands. The ladies shall assist with their own hands, And each be so well paid in seeing them That on the morrow he be sound and whole. FRIDAY The Day of Hunting Let Friday be your highest hunting-tide,— No hound nor brach nor mastiff absent thence,— Through a low wood, by many miles of dens, All covert, where the cunning beasts abide: Which now driven forth, at first you scatter wide,— Then close on them, and rip out blood and breath: Till all your huntsmen's horns wind at the death, And you count up how many beasts have died. Then, men and dogs together brought, you'll say: Go fairly greet from us this friend and that, Bid each make haste to blithest wassailings. Might not one vow that the whole pack had wings? What! hither, Beauty, Dian, Dragon, what! I think we held a royal hunt to-day. SATURDAY The Day of Hawking I've jolliest merriment for Saturday:— The very choicest of all hawks to fly That crane or heron could be stricken by, As up and down you course the steep highway. So shall the wild geese, in your deadly play, Lose at each stroke a wing, a tail, a thigh; And man with man and horse with horse shall vie, Till you all shout for glory and holiday. Then going home, you'll closely charge the cook: “All this is for to-morrow's roast and stew. Skin, lop, and truss: hang pots on every hook. And we must have fine wine and white bread too, Because this time we mean to feast: so look We do not think your kitchens lost on you.” SUNDAY The Day of Balls and Deeds of Arms in Florence And on the morrow, at first peep o'the day Which follows, and which men as Sunday spell,— Whom most him liketh, dame or damozel, Your chief shall choose out of the sweet array. So in the palace painted and made gay Shall he converse with her whom he loves best; And what he wishes, his desire express'd Shall bring to presence there, without gainsay. And youths shall dance, and men do feats of arms, And Florence be sought out on every side From orchards and from vineyards and from farms: That they who fill her streets from far and wide In your fine temper may discern such charms As shall from day to day be magnified. GUIDO DELLE COLONNE Canzone To Love and to his Lady O Love, who all this while hast urged me on, Shaking the reins, with never any rest,— Slacken for pity somewhat of thy haste; I am oppress'd with languor and foredone,— Having outrun the power of sufferance,— Having much more endured than who, through faith That his heart holds, makes no account of death. Love is assuredly a fair mischance, And well may it be called a happy ill: Yet thou, my lady, on this constant sting, So sharp a thing, have thou some pity still,— Howbeit a sweet thing too, unless it kill. O comely-favoured, whose soft eyes prevail, More fair than is another on this ground,— Lift now my mournful heart out of its stound, Which thus is bound for thee in great travail: For a high gale a little rain may end. Also, my lady, be not angered thou That Love should thee enforce, to whom all bow. There is but little shame to apprehend If to a higher strength the conquest be; And all the more to Love who conquers all. Why then appal my heart with doubts of thee? Courage and patience triumph certainly. I do not say that with such loveliness Such pride may not beseem; it suits thee well; For in a lovely lady pride may dwell, Lest homage fail and high esteem grow less: Yet pride's excess is not a thing to praise. Therefore, my lady, let thy harshness gain Some touch of pity which may still restrain Thy hand, ere Death cut short these hours and days. The sun is very high and full of light, And the more bright the higher he doth ride: So let thy pride, my lady, and thy height, Stand me in stead and turn to my delight. Still inmostly I love thee, labouring still That others may not know my secret smart. Oh! what a pain it is for the grieved heart To hold apart and not to show its ill! Yet by no will the face can hide the soul; And ever with the eyes the heart has need To be in all things willingly agreed. It were a mighty strength that should control The heart's fierce beat, and never speak a word: It were a mighty strength, I say again, To hide such pain, and to be sovran lord Of any heart that had such love to hoard. For Love can make the wisest turn astray; Love, at its most, of measure still has least; He is the maddest man who loves the best; It is Love's jest, to make men's hearts alway So hot that they by coldness cannot cool. The eyes unto the heart bear messages Of the beginnings of all pain and ease: And thou, my lady, in thy hand dost rule Mine eyes and heart which thou hast made thine own. Love rocks my life with tempests on the deep, Even as a ship round which the winds are blown: Thou art my pennon that will not go down. PIER MORONELLI, DI FIORENZA Canzonetta A bitter Song to his Lady O lady amorous, Merciless lady, Full blithely play'd ye These your beguilings. So with an urchin A man makes merry,— In mirth grows clamorous, Laughs and rejoices,— But when his choice is To fall aweary, Cheats him with silence. This is Love's portion:— In much wayfaring With many burdens He loads his servants, But at the sharing, The underservice And overservice Are alike barren. As my disaster Your jest I cherish, And well may perish. Even so a falcon Is sometimes taken And scantly cautell'd; Till when his master At length to loose him, To train and use him, Is after all gone,— The creature's throttled And will not waken. Wherefore, my lady, If you will own me, O look upon me! If I'm not thought on, At least perceive me! O do not leave me So much forgotten! If, lady, truly You wish my profit, What follows of it Though still you say so?— For all your well-wishes I still am waiting. I grow unruly, And deem at last I'm Only your pastime. A child will play so, Who greatly relishes Sporting and petting With a little wild bird: Unaware he kills it,— Then turns it, feels it, Calls it with a mild word, Is angry after,— Then again in laughter Loud is the child heard. O my delightful My own my lady, Upon the Mayday Which brought me to you Was all my haste then But a fool's venture? To have my sight full Of you propitious Truly my wish was, And to pursue you And let love chasten My heart to the centre. But warming, lady, May end in burning, Of all this yearning What comes, I beg you? In all your glances What is't a man sees?— Fever and ague. CIUNCIO FIORENTINO Canzone Of his Love; with the Figures of a Stag, of Water, and of an Eagle Lady, with all the pains that I can take, I'll sing my love renewed, if I may, well, And only in your praise. The stag in his old age seeks out a snake And eats it, and then drinks, (I have heard tell,) Fearing the hidden ways Of the snake's poison, and renews his youth. Even such a draught, in truth, Was your sweet welcome, which cast out of me, With whole cure instantly, Whatever pain I felt, for my own good, When first we met that I might be renew'd. A thing that has its proper essence changed By virtue of some powerful influence, As water has by fire, Returns to be itself, no more estranged, So soon as that has ceased which gave offence: Yea, now will more aspire Than ever, as the thing it first was made. Thine advent long delay'd Even thus had almost worn me out of love, Biding so far above: But now that thou hast brought love back for me, It mounts too much,—O lady, up to thee. I have heard tell, and can esteem it true, How that an eagle looking on the sun, Rejoicing for his part And bringing oft his young to look there too,— If one gaze longer than another one, On him will set his heart. So I am made aware that Love doth lead All lovers, by their need, To gaze upon the brightness of their loves; And whosoever moves His eyes the least from gazing upon her, The same shall be Love's inward minister. RUGGIERI DI AMICI, SICILIANO Canzonetta For a Renewal of Favours I play this sweet prelude For the best heart, and queen Of gentle womanhood, From here unto Messene; Of flowers the fairest one; The star that's next the sun; The brightest star of all. What time I look at her, My thoughts do crowd and stir And are made musical. Sweetest my lady, then Wilt thou not just permit, As once I spoke, again That I should speak of it? My heart is burning me Within, though outwardly I seem so brave and gay. Ah! dost thou not sometimes Remember the sweet rhymes Our lips made on that day?— When I her heart did move By kisses and by vows, Whom I then called my love, Fair-haired, with silver brows: She sang there as we sat; Nor then withheld she aught Which it were right to give; But said, “Indeed I will Be thine through good and ill As long as I may live.” And while I live, dear love, In gladness and in need Myself I will approve To be thine own indeed. If any man dare blame Our loves,—bring him to shame, O God! and of this year Let him not see the May. Is't not a vile thing, say, To freeze at Midsummer? CARNINO GHIBERTI, DA FIORENZA Canzone Being absent from his Lady, he fears Death I am afar, but near thee is my heart; Only soliciting That this long absence seem not ill to thee: For, if thou knew'st what pain and evil smart The lack of thy sweet countenance can bring, Thou wouldst remember me compassionately. Even as my case, the stag's is wont to be, Which, thinking to escape His death, escaping whence the pack gives cry, Is wounded and doth die. So, in my spirit imagining thy shape, I would fly Death, and Death o'ermasters me. I am o'erpower'd of Death when, telling o'er Thy beauties in my thought, I seem to have that which I have not: then I am as he who in each meteor, Dazzled and wildered, sees the thing he sought. In suchwise Love deals with me among men:— Thee whom I have not, yet who dost sustain My life, he bringeth in his arms to me Full oft,—yet I approach not unto thee. Ah! if we be not joined i'the very flesh, It cannot last but I indeed shall die By burden of this love that weigheth so. As an o'erladen bough, while yet 'tis fresh, Breaks, and itself and fruit are lost thereby— So shall I, love, be lost, alas for woe! And, if this slay indeed that thus doth rive My heart, how then shall I be comforted? Thou, as a lioness Her cub, in sore distress Might'st toil to bring me out of death alive: But couldst thou raise me up, if I were dead? Oh! but an' if thou wouldst, I were more glad Of death than life,—thus kept From thee and the true life thy face can bring. So in nowise could death be harsh or bad; But it should seem to me that I had slept And was awakened with thy summoning. Yet, sith the hope thereof is a vain thing, I, in fast fealty, Can like the Assassin Alluding to the Syrian tribe of Assassins, whose chief was the Old Man of the Mountain. be, Who, to be subject to his lord in all, Goes and accepts his death and has no heed: Even as he doth so could I do indeed. Nevertheless, this one memorial— The last—I send thee, for Love orders it. He, this last once, wills that thus much be writ In prayer that it may fall 'twixt thee and me After the manner of Two birds that feast their love Even unto anguish, till, if neither quit The other, one must perish utterly. PRINZIVALLE DORIA Canzone Of his Love, with the Figure of a sudden Storm Even as the day when it is yet at dawning Seems mild and kind, being fair to look upon, While the birds carol underneath their awning Of leaves, as if they never would have done; Which on a sudden changes, just at noon, And the broad light is broken into rain That stops and comes again; Even as the traveller, who had held his way Hopeful and glad because of the bright weather, Forgetteth then his gladness altogether; Even so am I, through Love, alas the day! It plainly is through Love that I am so. At first, he let me still grow happier Each day, and made her kindness seem to grow; But now he has quite changed her heart in her. And I, whose hopes throbbed and were all astir For times when I should call her mine aloud, And in her pride be proud Who is more fair than gems are, ye may say, Having that fairness which holds hearts in rule;— I have learnt now to count him but a fool Who before evening says, A goodly day. It had been better not to have begun, Since, having known my error, 'tis too late. This thing from which I suffer, thou hast done, Lady: canst thou restore me my first state? The wound thou gavest canst thou medicate? Not thou, forsooth: thou hast not any art To keep death from my heart. O lady! where is now my life's full meed Of peace,—mine once, and which thou took'st away? Surely it cannot now be far from day: Night is already very long indeed. The sea is much more beautiful at rest Than when the storm is trampling over it. Wherefore, to see the smile which has so bless'd This heart of mine, deem'st thou these eyes unfit? There is no maid so lovely, it is writ, That by such stern unwomanly regard Her face may not be marr'd. I therefore pray of thee, my own soul's wife, That thou remember me who am forgot. How shall I stand without thee? Art thou not The pillar of the building of my life? RUSTICO DI FILIPPO I Sonnet Of the making of Master Messerin When God had finished Master Messerin, He really thought it something to have done: Bird, man, and beast had got a chance in one, And each felt flattered, it was hoped, therein. For he is like a goose i'the windpipe thin, And like a cameleopard high i'the loins; To which, for manhood, you'll be told, he joins Some kinds of flesh-hues and a callow chin. As to his singing, he affects the crow; As to his learning, beasts in general; And sets all square by dressing like a man. God made him, having nothing else to do; And proved there is not anything at all He cannot make, if that's a thing He can. II Sonnet Of the Safety of Messer Fazio I have not been able to trace the Fazio to whom this sonnet refers. Master Bertuccio, you are called to account That you guard Fazio's life from poison ill: And every man in Florence tells me still He has no horse that he can safely mount. A mighty war-horse worth a thousand pound Stands in Cremona stabled at his will; Which for his honoured person should fulfil Its use. Nay, sir, I pray you be not found So poor a steward. For all fame of yours Is cared for best, believe me, when I say:— Our Florence gives Bertuccio charge of one Who rides her own proud spirit like a horse; Whom Cocciolo himself must needs obey; And whom she loves best, being her strongest son. III Sonnet Of Messer Ugolino The character here drawn certainly suggests Count Ugolino de' Gherardeschi, though it would seem that Rustico died nearly twenty years before the tragedy of the Tower of Famine. If any one had anything to say To the Lord Ugolino, because he's Not staunch, and never minds his promises, 'Twere hardly courteous, for it is his way. Courteous it were to say such sayings nay: As thus: He's true, sir, only takes his ease And don't care merely if it plague or please, And has good thoughts, no doubt, if they would stay. Now I know he's so loyal every whit And altogether worth such a good word As worst would best and best would worst befit. He'd love his party with a dear accord If only he could once quite care for it, But can't run post for any Law or Lord. PUCCIARELLO DI FIORENZA Sonnet Of Expediency Pass and let pass,—this counsel I would give,— And wrap thy cloak what way the wind may blow; Who cannot raise himself were wise to know How best, by dint of stooping, he may thrive. Take for ensample this: when the winds drive Against it, how the sapling tree bends low, And, once being prone, abideth even so Till the hard harsh wind cease to rend and rive. Wherefore, when thou behold'st thyself abased, Be blind, deaf, dumb; yet therewith none the less Note thou in peace what thou shalt hear and see, Till from such state by Fortune thou be raised. Then hack, lop, buffet, thrust, and so redress Thine ill that it may not return on thee. ALBERTUCCIO DELLA VIOLA Canzone Of his Lady dancing Among the dancers I beheld her dance, Her who alone is my heart's sustenance. So, as she danced, I took this wound of her; Alas! the flower of flowers, she did not fail. Woe's me! I will be Jew and blasphemer If the good god of Love do not prevail To bring me to thy grace, oh! thou most fair. My lady and my lord! alas for wail! How many days and how much sufferance? Oh! would to God that I had never seen Her face, nor had beheld her dancing so! Then had I missed this wound which is so keen— Yea, mortal—for I think not to win through Unless her love be my sweet medicine; Whereof I am in doubt, alas for woe! Fearing therein but such a little chance. She was apparelled in a Syrian cloth, My lady:—oh! but she did grace the same, Gladdening all folk, that they were nowise loth At sight of her to put their ills from them. But upon me her power hath had such growth That nought of joy thenceforth, but a live flame, Stirs at my heart,—which is her countenance. Sweet-smelling rose, sweet, sweet to smell and see, Great solace had she in her eyes for all; But heavy woe is mine; for upon me Her eyes as they were wont, did never fall. Which thing if it were done advisedly, I would choose death, that could no more appal, Not caring for my life's continuance. TOMMASO BUZZUOLA, DA FAENZA Sonnet He is in awe of his Lady Even as the moon amid the stars doth shed Her lovelier splendour of exceeding light,— Even so my lady seems the queen and head Among all other ladies in my sight. Her human visage, like an angel's made, Is glorious even to beauty's perfect height; And with her simple bearing soft and staid All secret modesties of soul unite. I therefore feel a dread in loving her; Because of thinking on her excellence, The wisdom and the beauty which she has. I pray her for the sake of God,—whereas I am her servant, yet in sore suspense Have held my peace,—to have me in her care. NOFFO BONAGUIDA Sonnet He is enjoined to pure Love A spirit of Love, with Love's intelligence, Maketh his sojourn alway in my breast, Maintaining me in perfect joy and rest; Nor could I live an hour, were he gone thence: Through whom my love hath such full permanence That thereby other loves seem dispossess'd. I have no pain, nor am with sighs oppress'd, So calm is the benignant influence. Because this spirit of Love, who speaks to me Of my dear lady's tenderness and worth, Says: “More than thus to love her seek thou not, Even as she loves thee in her wedded thought; But honour her in thy heart delicately: For this is the most blessed joy on earth.” LIPPO PASCHI DE' BARDI Sonnet He solicits a Lady's Favours Wert thou as prone to yield unto my prayer The thing, sweet virgin, which I ask of thee, As to repeat, with all humility, “Pray you go hence, and of your speech forbear;”— Then unto joy might I my heart prepare, Having my fellows in subserviency; But, for that thou contemn'st and mockest me, Whether of life or death I take no care. Because my heart may not assuage its drouth Nor ever may again rejoice at all Till the sweet face bend to be felt of man,— Till tenderly the beautiful soft mouth I kiss by thy good leave; thenceforth to call Blessing and triumph Love's extremest ban. SER PACE, NOTAIO DA FIORENZA Sonnet A Return to Love A fresh content of fresh enamouring Yields me afresh, at length, the sense of song, Who had well-nigh forgotten Love so long: But now my homage he will have me bring. So that my life is now a joyful thing, Having new-found desire, elate and strong, In her to whom all grace and worth belong, On whom I now attend for ministering. The countenance remembering, with the limbs, She was all imaged on my heart at once Suddenly by a single look at her: Whom when I now behold, a heat there seems Within, as of a subtle fire that runs Unto my heart, and remains burning there. NICCOLÒ DEGLI ALBIZZI Prolonged Sonnet When the Troops were returning from Milan If you could see, fair brother, how dead beat The fellows look who come through Rome to-day,— Black yellow smoke-dried visages,—you'd say They thought their haste at going all too fleet. Their empty victual-waggons up the street Over the bridge dreadfully sound and sway; Their eyes, as hanged men's, turning the wrong way; And nothing on their backs, or heads, or feet. One sees the ribs and all the skeletons Of their gaunt horses; and a sorry sight Are the torn saddles, crammed with straw and stones. They are ashamed, and march throughout the night; Stumbling, for hunger, on their marrowbones; Like barrels rolling, jolting, in this plight. Their arms all gone, not even their swords are saved; And each as silent as a man being shaved. FRANCESCO DA BARBERINO I Blank Verse Extracted from his long treatise, in unrhymed verse and in prose, “Of the Government and Conduct of Women”; (Del Reggimento e dei Costumi delle Donne). A Virgin declares her Beauties Do not conceive that I shall here recount All my own beauty: yet I promise you That you, by what I tell, shall understand All that befits and that is well to know. My bosom, which is very softly made, Of a white even colour without stain, Bears two fair apples, fragrant, sweetly-savoured, Gathered together from the Tree of Life The which is in the midst of Paradise. And these no person ever yet has touched; For out of nurse's and of mother's hands I was, when God in secret gave them me. These ere I yield I must know well to whom; And for that I would not be robbed of them, I speak not all the virtue that they have; Yet thus far speaking:—blessed were the man Who once should touch them, were it but a little;— See them I say not, for that might not be. My girdle, clipping pleasure round about, Over my clear dress even unto my knees Hangs down with sweet precision tenderly; And under it Virginity abides. Faithful and simple and of plain belief She is, with her fair garland bright like gold; And very fearful if she overhears Speech of herself; the wherefore ye perceive That I speak soft lest she be made ashamed. Lo! this is she who hath for company The Son of God and Mother of the Son; Lo! this is she who sits with many in heaven; Lo! this is she with whom are few on earth. II Sentenze This and the three following pieces are extracted from his “Documents of Love” (Documenti d'Amore). Of sloth against Sin There is a vice which oft I've heard men praise; and divers forms it has; And it is this. Whereas Some, by their wisdom, lordship, or repute, When tumults are afoot, Might stifle them, or at the least allay,— These certain ones will say, “The wise man bids thee fly the noise of men.” One says, “Wouldst thou maintain Worship,—avoid where thou mayst not avail; And do not breed worse ail By adding one more voice to strife begun.” Another, with this one, Avers, “I could but bear a small expense, Or yield a slight defence.” A third says this, “I could but offer words.” Or one, whose tongue records Unwillingly his own base heart, will say, “I'll not be led astray To bear a hand in others' life or death.” They have it in their teeth! For unto this each man is pledged and bound; And this thing shall be found Entered against him at the Judgment Day. III Sentenze Of Sins in Speech Now these four things, if thou Consider, are so bad that none are worse. First,—among counsellors To thrust thyself, when not called absolutely. And in the other three Many offend by their own evil wit. When men in council sit, One talks because he loves not to be still; And one to have his will; And one for nothing else but only show. These rules were well to know, First for the first, for the others afterward. Where many are repair'd And met together, never go with them Unless thou'rt called by name. This for the first: now for the other three. What truly thou dost see Turn in thy mind, and faithfully report; And in the plainest sort Thy wisdom may, proffer thy counselling. There is another thing Belongs hereto, the which is on this wise. If one should ask advice Of thine for his own need whate'er it be,— This is my word to thee:— Deny it if it be not clearly of use: Or turn to some excuse That may avail, and thou shalt have done well. IV Sentenze Of Importunities and Troublesome Persons There is a vice prevails Concerning which I'll set you on your guard; And other four, which hard It were (as may be thought) that I should blame. Some think that still of them— Whate'er is said—some ill speech lies beneath; And this to them is death: Whereby we plainly may perceive their sins. And now let others wince. One sort there is, who, thinking that they please, (Because no wit's in these,) Where'er you go, will stick to you all day, And answer, (when you say, “Don't let me tire you out!”) “Oh never mind— Say nothing of the kind,— It's quite a pleasure to be where you are!” A second,—when, as far As he could follow you, the whole day long He's sung you his dull song, And you for courtesy have borne with it,— Will think you've had a treat. A third will take his special snug delight,— Some day you've come in sight Of some great thought and got it well in view,— Just then to drop on you. A fourth, for any insult you've received Will say he is so grieved, And daily bring the subject up again. So now I would be fain To show you your best course at all such times; And counsel you in rhymes That you yourself offend not in likewise. In these four cases lies This help:—to think upon your own affair, Just showing here and there By just a word that you are listening; And still to the last thing That's said to you attend in your reply, And let the rest go by,— It's quite a chance if he remembers them. Yet do not, all the same, Deny your ear to any speech of weight. But if importunate The speaker is, and will not be denied, Just turn the speech aside When you can find some plausible pretence; For if you have the sense, By a quick question or a sudden doubt You may so put him out That he shall not remember where he was, And by such means you'll pass Upon your way and be well rid of him. And now it may beseem I give you the advice I promised you. Before you have to do With men whom you must meet continually, Take notice what they be; And so you shall find readily enough If you can win their love, And give yourself for answer Yes or No. And finding Yes, do so That still the love between you may increase. Yet if they be of these Whom sometimes it is hard to understand, Let some slight cause be plann'd, And seem to go,—so you shall learn their will: And if but one sit still As 'twere in thought,—then go, unless he call. Lastly, if insult gall Your friend, this is the course that you should take. At first 'tis well you make As much lament thereof as you think fit,— Then speak no more of it, Unless himself should bring it up again; And then no more refrain From full discourse, but say his grief is yours. V Sentenze Of Caution Say, wouldst thou guard thy son, That sorrow he may shun? Begin at the beginning And let him keep from sinning. Wouldst guard thy house? One door Make to it, and no more. Wouldst guard thine orchard-wall? Be free of fruit to all. FAZIO DEGLI UBERTI I Canzone His Portrait of his Lady, Angiola of Verona I look at the crisp golden-threaded hair Whereof, to thrall my heart, Love twists a net: Using at times a string of pearls for bait, And sometimes with a single rose therein. I look into her eyes which unaware Through mine own eyes to my heart penetrate; Their splendour, that is excellently great, To the sun's radiance seeming near akin, Yet from herself a sweeter light to win. So that I, gazing on that lovely one, Discourse in this wise with my secret thought:— “Woe's me! why am I not, Even as my wish, alone with her alone,— That hair of hers, so heavily uplaid, To shed down braid by braid, And make myself two mirrors of her eyes Within whose light all other glory dies?” I look at the amorous beautiful mouth, The spacious forehead which her locks enclose, The small white teeth, the straight and shapely nose, And the clear brows of a sweet pencilling. And then the thought within me gains full growth, Saying, “Be careful that thy glance now goes Between her lips, red as an open rose, Quite full of every dear and precious thing; And listen to her gracious answering, Born of the gentle mind that in her dwells, Which from all things can glean the nobler half. Look thou when she doth laugh How much her laugh is sweeter than aught else.” Thus evermore my spirit makes avow Touching her mouth; till now I would give anything that I possess, Only to hear her mouth say frankly, “Yes.” I look at her white easy neck, so well From shoulders and from bosom lifted out; And at her round cleft chin, which beyond doubt No fancy in the world could have design'd. And then, with longing grown more voluble, “Were it not pleasant now,” pursues my thought, “To have that neck within thy two arms caught And kiss it till the mark were left behind?” Then, urgently: “The eyelids of thy mind Open thou: if such loveliness be given To sight here,—what of that which she doth hide? Only the wondrous ride Of sun and planets through the visible heaven Tells us that there beyond is Paradise. Thus, if thou fix thine eyes, Of a truth certainly thou must infer That every earthly joy abides in her,” I look at the large arms, so lithe and round,— At the hands, which are white and rosy too,— At the long fingers, clasped and woven through, Bright with the ring which one of them doth wear. Then my thought whispers: “Were thy body wound Within those arms, as loving women's do, In all thy veins were born a life made new Which thou couldst find no language to declare. Behold if any picture can compare With her just limbs, each fit in shape and size, Or match her angel's colour like a pearl. She is a gentle girl To see; yet when it needs, her scorn can rise, Meek, bashful, and in all things temperate, Her virtue holds its state; In whose least act there is that gift express'd Which of all reverence makes her worthiest.” Soft as a peacock steps she, or as a stork Straight on herself, taller and statelier: 'Tis a good sight how every limb doth stir For ever in a womanly sweet way. “Open thy soul to see God's perfect work,” (My thought begins afresh), “and look at her When with some lady-friend exceeding fair She bends and mingles arms and locks in play. Even as all lesser lights vanish away, When the sun moves, before his dazzling face, So is this lady brighter than all these. How should she fail to please,— Love's self being no more than her loveliness? In all her ways some beauty springs to view; All that she loves to do Tends alway to her honour's single scope; And only from good deeds she draws her hope.” Song, thou canst surely say, without pretence, That since the first fair woman ever made, Not one can have display'd More power upon all hearts than this one doth; Because in her are both Loveliness and the soul's true excellence:— And yet (woe's me!) is pity absent thence? II Extract from the “Dittamondo” I am quite sorry (after the foregoing love-song, the original of which is not perhaps surpassed by any poem of its class in existence) to endanger the English reader's respect for Fazio by these extracts from the Dittamondo, or “Song of the World,” in which he will find his own country endowed with some astounding properties. However, there are a few fine characteristic sentences, and the rest is no more absurd than other travellers' tales of that day; while the table of our Norman line of kings is not without some historical interest. It must be remembered that the love-song was the work of Fazio's youth, and the Dittamondo that of his old age, when we may suppose his powers to have been no longer at their best. Besides what I have given relating to Great Britain, there is a table of the Saxon dynasty, and some surprising facts about Scotland and Ireland; as well as a curious passage written in French, and purporting to be an account, given by a royal courier, of Edward the Third's invasion of France. I felt half disposed to include these, but was afraid of overloading with such matter a selection made chiefly for the sake of poetic beauty. I should mention that the Dittamondo,like Dante's great poem, is written in terza rima; but as perfect literality was of primary importance in the above extracts, I have departed for once from my rule of fidelity to the original metre. (Lib. iv. Cap. 23) Of England, and of its Marvels Now to Great Britain we must make our way, Unto which kingdom Brutus gave its name What time he won it from the giants' rule. 'Tis thought at first its name was Albion, And Anglia, from a damsel, afterwards. The island is so great and rich and fair, It conquers others that in Europe be, Even as the sun surpasses other stars. Many and great sheep-pastures bountifully Nature has set there, and herein more bless'd, That they can hold themselves secure from wolves. Jet also doth the hollow land enrich, (Whose properties my guide Solinus here Told me, and how its colour comes to it;) And pearls are found in great abundance too. The people are as white and comely-faced As they of Ethiop land are black and foul. Many hot springs and limpid fountain-heads We found about this land, and spacious plains, And divers beasts that dwell within thick woods. Plentiful orchards too and fertile fields It has, and castle-forts, and cities fair With palaces and girth of lofty walls. And proud wide rivers without any fords We saw, and flesh, and fish, and crops enough. Justice is strong throughout those provinces. Now this I saw not; but so strange a thing It was to hear, and by all men confirm'd, That it is fit to note it as I heard;— To wit, there is a certain islet here Among the rest, where folk are born with tails, Short, as are found in stags and such-like beasts. Mediæval Britons would seem really to have been credited with this slight peculiarity. At the siege of Damietta, Cœur-de-Lion's bastard brother is said to have pointed out the prudence of deferring the assault, and to have received for rejoinder from the French crusaders, “See now these faint-hearted English with the tails!” To which the Englishman replied, “You will need stout hearts to keep near our tails when the assault is made.” For this I vouch,—that when a child is freed From swaddling bands, the mother without stay Passes elsewhere, and 'scapes the care of it. I put no faith herein; but it is said Among them, how such marvellous trees are there That they grow birds, and this is their sole fruit. This is the Barnacle-tree, often described in old books of travels and natural history, and which Sir Thomas Browne classes gravely among his “Vulgar Errors.” Forty times eighty is the circuit ta'en, With ten times fifteen, if I do not err, By our miles reckoning its circumference. Here every metal may be dug; and here I found the people to be given to God, Steadfast, and strong, and restive to constraint. Nor is this strange, when one considereth; For courage, beauty, and large-heartedness, Were there, as it is said, in ancient days. North Wales, and Orkney, and the banks of Thames, Strangoure and Listenois and Northumberland, I chose with my companion to behold. What follows relates to the Romances of the Round Table. The only allusion here which I cannot trace to the Mort d'Arthur is one where “Rech” and “Nida” are spoken of: it seems however that, by a perversion hardly too corrupt for Fazio, these might be the Geraint and Enid whose story occurs in the Mabinogion, and has been used by Tennyson in his Idylls of the King. Why Fazio should have “joyed to see” Merlin's stone “for another's love” seems inscrutable; unless indeed the words “per amor altrui” are a mere idiom, and Merlin himself is meant; and even then Merlin, in his compulsory niche under the stone, may hardly have been grateful for such friendly interest. I should not omit, in this second edition, to acknowledge several obligations, as regards the above extract from the Dittamondo, to the unknown author of an acute and kindly article in the Spectator for January 18th, 1862. We went to London, and I saw the Tower Where Guenevere her honour did defend, With the Thames river which runs close to it. I saw the castle which by force was ta'en With the three shields by gallant Lancelot, The second year that he did deeds of arms. I beheld Camelot despoiled and waste; And was where one and the other had her birth, The maids of Corbonek and Astolat. Also I saw the castle where Geraint Lay with his Enid; likewise Merlin's stone, Which for another's love I joyed to see. I found the tract where is the pine-tree well, And where of old the knight of the black shield With weeping and with laughter kept the pass, What time the pitiless and bitter dwarf Before Sir Gawaine's eyes discourteously With many heavy stripes led him away. I saw the valley which Sir Tristram won When having slain the giant hand to hand He set the stranger knights from prison free. And last I viewed the field, at Salisbury, Of that great martyrdom which left the world Empty of honour, valour, and delight. So, compassing that Island round and round, I saw and hearkened many things and more Which might be fair to tell but which I hide. III Extract from the “Dittamondo” (Lib. iv. Cap. 25) Of the Dukes of Normandy, and thence of the Kings of England, from William the First to Edward the Third Thou well hast heard that Rollo had two sons, One William Longsword, and the other Richard, Whom thou now know'st to the marrow, as I do. The speaker here is the poet's guide Solinus (an historical and geographical writer of the third century,) who bears the same relation to him which Virgil bears to Dante in the Commedia. Daring and watchful, as a leopard is, Was William, fair in body and in face, Ready at all times, never slow to act. He fought great battles, but at last was slain By the earl of Flanders; so that in his place Richard his son was o'er the people set. And next in order, lit with blessed flame Of the Holy Spirit, his son followed him, Who justly lived 'twixt more and less midway,— His father's likeness, as in shape in name. So unto him succeeded as his heir Robert the Frank, high-counselled and august: And thereon following, I proceed to tell How William, who was Robert's son, did make The realm of England his co-heritage. The same was brave and courteous certainly, Generous and gracious, humble before God, Master in war and versed in counsel too. He with great following came from Normandy And fought with Harold, and so left him slain, And took the realm, and held it at his will. Thus did this kingdom change its signiory; And know that all the kings it since has had Only from this man take their origin. Therefore, that thou mayst quite forget its past, I say this happened when, since our Lord's Love, Some thousand years and sixty were gone by. While the fourth Henry ruled as emperor, This king of England fought in many wars, And waxed through all in honour and account. And William Rufus next succeeded him; Tall, strong, and comely-limbed, but therewith proud And grasping, and a killer of his kind. In body he was like his father much, But was in nature more his contrary Than fire and water when they come together; Yet so far good that he won fame in arms, And by himself risked many an enterprise, All which he brought with honour to an end. Also if he were bad, he gat great ill; For, chasing once the deer within a wood, And having wandered from his company, Him by mischance a servant of his own Hit with an arrow, that he fell and died. And after him Henry the First was king, His brother, but therewith the father's like, Being well with God and just in peace and war. Next Stephen, on his death, the kingdom seized, But with sore strife; of whom thus much be said, That he was frank and good is told of him. And after him another Henry reigned, Who, when the war in France was waged and done Passed beyond seas with the first Frederick. Then Richard came, who, after heavy toil At sea, was captive made in Germany, Leaving the Sepulchre to join his host. Who being dead, full heavy was the wrath Of John his brother; and so well he took Revenge, that still a moan is made of it. This John in kingly largesse and in war Delighted, when the kingdom fell to him; Hunting and riding ever in hot haste. Handsome in body and most poor in heart, Henry his son and heir succeeded him, Of whom to speak I count it wretchedness. Yet there's some good to say of him, I grant; Because of him was the good Edward born, Whose valour still is famous in the world. The same was he who, being without dread Of the Old Man's Assassins, captured them, And who repaid the jester if he lied. This may either refer to some special incident or merely mean generally that he would not suffer lying even in a jester. The same was he who over seas wrought scathe So many times to Malekdar, and bent Unto the Christian rule whole provinces. He was a giant of his body, and great And proud to view, and of such strength of soul As never saddens with adversity. His reign was long; and when his death befell, The second Edward mounted to the throne, Who was of one kind with his grandfather. I say from what report still says of him, That he was evil, of base intellect, And would not be advised by any man. Conceive, good heart! that how to thatch a roof With straw,—conceive!—he held himself expert, And therein constantly would take delight! By fraud he seized the Earl of Lancaster, And what he did with him I say not here, But that he left him neither town nor tower. And thiswise, step by step, thou mayst perceive That I to the third Edward have advanced, Who now lives strong and full of enterprise, And who already has grown manifest For the best Christian known of in the world. Thus I have told, as thou wouldst have me tell, The race of William even unto the end. FRANCO SACCHETTI I Ballata His Talk with certain Peasant-girls “Ye graceful peasant-girls and mountain-maids, Whence come ye homeward through these evening shades?” “We come from where the forest skirts the hill; A very little cottage is our home, Where with our father and our mother still We live, and love our life, nor wish to roam. Back every evening from the field we come And bring with us our sheep from pasturing there.” “Where, tell me, is the hamlet of your birth, Whose fruitage is the sweetest by so much? Ye seem to me as creatures worship-worth, The shining of your countenance is such. No gold about your clothes, coarse to the touch, Nor silver; yet with such an angel's air! “I think your beauties might make great complaint Of being thus shown over mount and dell; Because no city is so excellent But that your stay therein were honourable. In very truth, now, does it like ye well To live so poorly on the hill-side here?” “Better it liketh one of us, pardie, Behind her flock to seek the pasture-stance, Far better than it liketh one of ye To ride unto your curtained rooms and dance. We seek no riches neither golden chance Save wealth of flowers to weave into our hair.” Ballad, if I were now as once I was, I'd make myself a shepherd on some hill, And, without telling any one, would pass Where these girls went, and follow at their will; And “Mary” and “Martin” we would murmur still, And I would be for ever where they were. II Catch On a Fine Day “Be stirring, girls! we ought to have a run: Look, did you ever see so fine a day? Fling spindles right away, And rocks and reels and wools: Now don't be fools,— To-day your spinning's done. Up with you, up with you!” So, one by one They caught hands, catch who can, Then singing, singing, to the river they ran, They ran, they ran To the river, the river; And the merry-go-round Carries them at a bound To the mill o'er the river. “Miller, miller, miller, Weigh me this lady And this other. Now, steady!” “You weigh a hundred, you, And this one weighs two.” “Why, dear, you do get stout!” “You think so, dear, no doubt: Are you in a decline?” “Keep your temper, and I'll keep mine. Come, girls,” (“O thank you, miller!”) “We'll go home when you will.” So, as we crossed the hill, A clown came in great grief Crying, “Stop thief! stop thief! O what a wretch I am!” “Well, fellow, here's a clatter! Well, what's the matter?” “O Lord, O Lord, the wolf has got my lamb!” Now at that word of woe, The beauties came and clung about me so That if wolf had but shown himself, maybe I too had caught a lamb that fled to me. III Catch On a Wet Day As I walked thinking through a little grove, Some girls that gathered flowers came passing me, Saying, “Look here! look there!” delightedly. “O here it is!” “What's that?” “A lily, love.” “And there are violets!” “Further for roses! Oh the lovely pets— The darling beauties! Oh the nasty thorn! Look here, my hand's all torn!” “What's that that jumps?” “Oh don't! it's a grasshopper!” “Come run, come run, Here's bluebells!” “Oh what fun!” “Not that way! Stop her!” “Yes, this way!” “Pluck them, then!” “Oh, I've found mushrooms! Oh look here!” “Oh, I'm Quite sure that further on we'll get wild thyme.” “Oh we shall stay too long, it's going to rain! There's lightning, oh there's thunder!” “Oh shan't we hear the vesper-bell, I wonder?” “Why, it's not nones, you silly little thing; And don't you hear the nightingales that sing Fly away O die away?” “O I hear something! Hush!” “Why, where? what is it then?” “Ah! in that bush!” So every girl here knocks it, shakes and shocks it, Till with the stir they make Out skurries a great snake. “O Lord! O me! Alack! Ah me! alack!” They scream, and then all run and scream again, And then in heavy drops down comes the rain. Each running at the other in a fright, Each trying to get before the other, and crying, And flying, stumbling, tumbling, wrong or right; One sets her knee There where her foot should be; One has her hands and dress All smothered up with mud in a fine mess; And one gets trampled on by two or three. What's gathered is let fall About the wood and not picked up at all. The wreaths of flowers are scattered on the ground; And still as screaming hustling without rest They run this way and that and round and round, She thinks herself in luck who runs the best. I stood quite still to have a perfect view, And never noticed till I got wet through. ANONYMOUS POEMS I Sonnet A Lady laments for her lost Lover, by similitude of a Falcon Alas for me, who loved a falcon well! So well I loved him, I was nearly dead: Ever at my low call he bent his head, And ate of mine, not much, but all that fell. Now he has fled, how high I cannot tell, Much higher now than ever he has fled, And is in a fair garden housed and fed; Another lady, alas! shall love him well. O my own falcon whom I taught and rear'd! Sweet bells of shining gold I gave to thee That in the chase thou shouldst not be afeard. Now thou hast risen like the risen sea, Broken thy jesses loose, and disappear'd, As soon as thou wast skilled in falconry. II Ballata One speaks of the Beginning of his Love This fairest one of all the stars, whose flame, For ever lit, my inner spirit fills, Came to me first one day between the hills. I wondered very much; but God the Lord Said, “From Our Virtue, lo! this light is pour'd.” So in a dream it seemed that I was led By a great Master to a garden spread With lilies underfoot and overhead. III Ballata One speaks of his False Lady When the last greyness dwells throughout the air, And the first star appears, Appeared to me a lady very fair. I seemed to know her well by her sweet air; And, gazing, I was hers. To honour her, I followed her: and then.... Ah! what thou givest, God give thee again, Whenever thou remain'st as I remain. IV Ballata One speaks of his Feigned and Real Love For no love borne by me, Neither because I care To find that thou art fair,— To give another pain I gaze on thee. And now, lest such as thought that thou couldst move My heart, should read this verse, I will say here, another has my love. An angel of the spheres She seems, and I am hers; Who has more gentleness And owns a fairer face Than any woman else,—at least, to me. Sweeter than any, more in all at ease, Lighter and lovelier. Not to disparage thee; for whoso sees May like thee more than her. This vest will one prefer, And one another vest. To me she seems the best, And I am hers, and let what will be, be. For no love borne by me, Neither because I care To find that thou art fair,— To give another pain, I gaze on thee. V Ballata Of True and False Singing A little wild bird sometimes at my ear Sings his own little verses very clear: Others sing louder that I do not hear. For singing loudly is not singing well; But ever by the song that's soft and low The master-singer's voice is plain to tell. Few have it and yet all are masters now, And each of them can trill out what he calls His ballads, canzonets, and madrigals. The world with masters is so covered o'er, There is no room for pupils any more. END OF DANTE AND HIS CIRCLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS from the GERMAN, ITALIAN, FRENCH, AND GREEK LENORE By G. A. Bürger I have retained the German version of the heroine's name; thinking it more suited to the metre than the lengthy English word “Leonora”—and by far less unpleasing to the ear than the stunted and ugly abbreviation, “Leonor.” G. C. R. Up rose Lenore as the red morn wore, From weary visions starting; “Art faithless, William, or, William, art dead? 'Tis long since thy departing.” For he, with Frederick's men of might, In fair Prague waged the uncertain fight; Nor once had he writ in the hurry of war, And sad was the true heart that sickened afar. The Empress and the King, With ceaseless quarrel tired, At length relaxed the stubborn hate Which rivalry inspired: And the martial throng, with laugh and song, Spoke of their homes as they rode along, And clank, clank, clank! came every rank, With the trumpet-sound that rose and sank. And here and there and everywhere, Along the swarming ways, Went old man and boy, with the music of joy, On the gallant bands to gaze; And the young child shouted to spy the vaward, And trembling and blushing the bride pressed forward: But ah! for the sweet lips of Lenore The kiss and the greeting are vanished and o'er. From man to man all wildly she ran With a swift and searching eye; But she felt alone in the mighty mass, As it crushed and crowded by: On hurried the troop,—a gladsome group,— And proudly the tall plumes wave and droop: She tore her hair and she turned her round, And madly she dashed her against the ground. Her mother clasped her tenderly With soothing words and mild: “My child, may God look down on thee,— God comfort thee, my child.” “Oh! mother, mother! gone is gone! I reck no more how the world runs on: What pity to me does God impart? Woe, woe, woe! for my heavy heart!” “Help, Heaven, help and favour her! Child, utter an Ave Marie! Wise and great are the doings of God; He loves and pities thee.” “Out, mother, out, on the empty lie! Doth he heed my despair,—doth he list to my cry? What boots it now to hope or to pray? The night is come,—there is no more day.” “Help, Heaven, help! who knows the Father Knows surely that he loves his child: The bread and the wine from the hand divine Shall make thy tempered grief less wild.” “Oh! mother, dear mother! the wine and the bread Will not soften the anguish that bows down my head; For bread and for wine it will yet be as late That his cold corpse creeps from the grim grave's gate.” “What if the traitor's false faith failed, By sweet temptation tried,— What if in distant Hungary He clasp another bride?— Despise the fickle fool, my girl, Who hath ta'en the pebble and spurned the pearl: While soul and body shall hold together In his perjured heart shall be stormy weather.” “Oh! mother, mother! gone is gone, And lost will still be lost! Death, death is the goal of my weary soul, Crushed and broken and crost. Spark of my life! down, down to the tomb: Die away in the night, die away in the gloom! What pity to me does God impart? Woe, woe, woe! for my heavy heart!” “Help, Heaven, help, and heed her not, For her sorrows are strong within; She knows not the words that her tongue repeats,— Oh! count them not for sin! Cease, cease, my child, thy wretchedness, And think on the promised happiness; So shall thy mind's calm ecstasy Be a hope and a home and a bridegroom to thee.” “My mother, what is happiness? My mother, what is Hell? With William is my happiness,— Without him is my Hell! Spark of my life! down, down to the tomb: Die away in the night, die away in the gloom! Earth and Heaven, and Heaven and earth, Reft of William are nothing worth.” Thus grief racked and tore the breast of Lenore, And was busy at her brain; Thus rose her cry to the Power on high, To question and arraign: Wringing her hands and beating her breast,— Tossing and rocking without any rest;— Till from her light veil the moon shone through, And the stars leapt out on the darkling blue. But hark to the clatter and the pat pat patter Of a horse's heavy hoof! How the steel clanks and rings as the rider springs! How the echo shouts aloof! While slightly and lightly the gentle bell Tingles and jingles softly and well; And low and clear through the door plank thin Comes the voice without to the ear within: “Holla! holla! unlock the gate; Art waking, my bride, or sleeping? Is thy heart still free and still faithful to me? Art laughing, my bride, or weeping?” “Oh! wearily, William, I've waited for you,— Woefully watching the long day through,— With a great sorrow sorrowing For the cruelty of your tarrying.” “Till the dead midnight we saddled not,— I have journeyed far and fast— And hither I come to carry thee back Ere the darkness shall be past.” “Ah! rest thee within till the night's more calm; Smooth shall thy couch be, and soft, and warm: Hark to the winds, how they whistle and rush Through the twisted twine of the hawthorn-bush.” “Through the hawthorn-bush let whistle and rush,— Let whistle, child, let whistle! Mark the flash fierce and high of my steed's bright eye, And his proud crest's eager bristle. Up, up and away! I must not stay: Mount swiftly behind me! up, up and away! An hundred miles must be ridden and sped Ere we may lie down in the bridal-bed.” “What! ride an hundred miles to-night, By thy mad fancies driven! Dost hear the bell with its sullen swell, As it rumbles out eleven?” “Look forth! look forth! the moon shines bright: We and the dead gallop fast through the night. 'Tis for a wager I bear thee away To the nuptial couch ere break of day.” “Ah! where is the chamber, William dear, And William, where is the bed?” “Far, far from here: still, narrow, and cool; Plank and bottom and lid.” “Hast room for me?”—“For me and thee; Up, up to the saddle right speedily! The wedding-guests are gathered and met, And the door of the chamber is open set.” She busked her well, and into the selle She sprang with nimble haste,— And gently smiling, with a sweet beguiling, Her white hands clasped his waist:— And hurry, hurry! ring, ring, ring! To and fro they sway and swing; Snorting and snuffing they skim the ground, And the sparks spurt up, and the stones run round. Here to the right and there to the left Flew fields of corn and clover, And the bridges flashed by to the dazzled eye, As rattling they thundered over. “What ails my love? the moon shines bright: Bravely the dead men ride through the night. Is my love afraid of the quiet dead?” “Ah! no;—let them sleep in their dusty bed!” On the breeze cool and soft what tune floats aloft, While the crows wheel overhead?— Ding dong! ding dong! 'tis the sound, 'tis the song,— “Room, room for the passing dead!” Slowly the funeral-train drew near, Bearing the coffin, bearing the bier; And the chime of their chaunt was hissing and harsh, Like the note of the bull-frog within the marsh. “You bury your corpse at the dark midnight, With hymns and bells and wailing;— But I bring home my youthful wife To a bride-feast's rich regaling. Come, chorister, come with thy choral throng, And solemnly sing me a marriage-song; Come, friar, come,—let the blessing be spoken, That the bride and the bridegroom's sweet rest be unbroken.” Died the dirge and vanished the bier:— Obedient to his call, Hard hard behind, with a rush like the wind, Came the long steps' pattering fall: And ever further! ring, ring, ring! To and fro they sway and swing; Snorting and snuffing they skim the ground, And the sparks spurt up, and the stones run round. How flew to the right, how flew to the left, Trees, mountains in the race! How to the left, and the right and the left, Flew town and market-place! “What ails my love? the moon shines bright: Bravely the dead men ride through the night. Is my love afraid of the quiet dead?” “Ah! let them alone in their dusty bed!” See, see, see! by the gallows-tree, As they dance on the wheel's broad hoop, Up and down, in the gleam of the moon Half lost, an airy group:— “Ho! ho! mad mob, come hither amain, And join in the wake of my rushing train;— Come, dance me a dance, ye dancers thin, Ere the planks of the marriage-bed close us in.” And hush, hush, hush! the dreamy rout Came close with a ghastly bustle, Like the whirlwind in the hazel-bush, When it makes the dry leaves rustle: And faster, faster! ring, ring, ring! To and fro they sway and swing; Snorting and snuffing they skim the ground, And the sparks spurt up, and the stones run round. How flew the moon high overhead, In the wild race madly driven! In and out, how the stars danced about, And reeled o'er the flashing heaven! “What ails my love? the moon shines bright: Bravely the dead men ride through the night. Is my love afraid of the quiet dead?” “Alas! let them sleep in their dusty bed.” “Horse, horse! meseems 'tis the cock's shrill note, And the sand is well nigh spent; Horse, horse, away! 'tis the break of day,— 'Tis the morning air's sweet scent. Finished, finished is our ride: Room, room for the bridegroom and the bride! At last, at last, we have reached the spot, For the speed of the dead man has slackened not!” And swiftly up to an iron gate With reins relaxed they went; At the rider's touch the bolts flew back, And the bars were broken and bent; The doors were burst with a deafening knell, And over the white graves they dashed pell-mell: The tombs around looked grassy and grim, As they glimmered and glanced in the moonlight dim. But see! but see! in an eyelid's beat, Townoo! a ghastly wonder! The horseman's jerkin, piece by piece, Dropped off like brittle tinder! Fleshless and hairless, a naked skull, The sight of his weird head was horrible; The lifelike mask was there no more, And a scythe and a sandglass the skeleton bore. Loud snorted the horse as he plunged and reared, And the sparks were scattered round:— What man shall say if he vanished away, Or sank in the gaping ground? Groans from the earth and shrieks in the air! Howling and wailing everywhere! Half dead, half living, the soul of Lenore Fought as it never had fought before. The churchyard troop,—a ghostly group,— Close round the dying girl; Out and in they hurry and spin Through the dance's weary whirl: “Patience, patience, when the heart is breaking; With thy God there is no question-making: Of thy body thou art quit and free: Heaven keep thy soul eternally!” HENRY THE LEPER A SWABIAN MIRACLE-RHYME BY HARTMANN VON AUË (A. D. 1100–1200) Hartmann von Auë, the fame went, Was a good knight, and well acquent With books in every character. Having sought this many a year, He found at length a record fit, As far as he apprehendeth it, To smoothe the rugged paths uneven, To glorify God which is in Heaven, And gain kind thoughts from each true hear For himself as also for his art. Unto your ears this song sings he, And begs, an you hear it patiently, That his reward be held in store; And that whoso, when his days are o'er, Shall read and understand this book, For the writer unto God may look, Praying that God may be his goal And the place of rest to his poor soul. That man his proper shrift shall win Who prayeth for his brother's sin. PART I Once on a time, rhymeth the rhyme, In Swabia-land once on a time, There was a nobleman sojourning, Unto whose nobleness everything Of virtue and high-hearted excellence Worthy his line and his large pretence With plentiful measure was meted out: The land rejoiced in him round about. He was like a prince in his governing— In his wealth he was like a king; But most of all by the fame far-flown Of his great knightliness was he known, North and south, upon land and sea. By his name he was Henry of the Lea. All things whereby the truth grew dim Were held as hateful foes with him: By solemn oath was he bounden fast To shun them while his life should last. In honour all his days went by: Therefore his soul might look up high To honourable authority. A paragon of all graciousness, A blossoming branch of youthfulness, A looking-glass to the world around, A stainless and priceless diamond, Of gallant 'haviour a beautiful wreath, A home when the tyrant menaceth, A buckler to the breast of his friend, And courteous without measure or end; Whose deeds of arms 'twere long to tell; Of precious wisdom a limpid well, A singer of ladies every one, And very lordly to look upon In feature and bearing and countenance:— Say, failed he in anything, perchance, The summit of all glory to gain And the lasting honour of all men? Alack! the soul that was up so high Dropped down into pitiful misery; The lofty courage was stricken low, The steady triumph stumbled in woe, And the world-joy was hidden in the dust, Even as all such shall be and must. He whose life in the senses centreth Is already in the shadow of death. The joys, called great, of this under-state Burn up the bosom early and late; And their shining is altogether vain, For it bringeth anguish and trouble and pain. The torch that flames for men to see And wasteth to ashes inwardly Is verily but an imaging Of man's own life, the piteous thing. The whole is brittleness and mishap: We sit and dally in Fortune's lap Till tears break in our smiles betwixt, And the shallow honey-draught be mix'd With sorrow's wormwood fathom-deep. Oh! rest not therefore, man, nor sleep:— In the blossoming of thy flower-crown A sword is raised to smite thee down. Even with Earl Henry it was thus: Though gladsome and very glorious Was the manner of his life, yet God Upon his spirit's fulness trod. The curse that fell was heavy and deep— A thunderbolt in the hour of sleep. His body, whose beauty was so much, Was turned unto loathing and reproach,— Full of foul sores, increasing fast, Which grew into leprosy at last. Ages ago the Lord even so Ordained that Job should be brought low, To prove him if in such distress He would hold fast his righteousness. The great rich Earl, who otherwhile Met but man's praise and woman's smile, Was now no less than out-thrust quite. The day of the world hath a dark night. What time Lord Henry wholly knew The stound that he was come into, And saw folk shun him as he went, And his pains food for merriment, Then did he, as often it is done By those whom sorrow falleth on— He wrapped not round him as a robe The patience that was found in Job. For holy Job meet semblance took, And bowed him under God's rebuke, Which had given to him the world's reverse, And the shame, and the anguish, and the curse, Only to snatch away his soul From emptiness and earth's control: Therefore his soul had triumphing Inmostly at the troublous thing. In such wise Henry bore him not; Its duteousness his heart forgot; His pride waxed hard and kept its place, But the glory departed from his face, And that which was his strength grew weak. The hand that smote him on the cheek Was all too heavy. It was night Now, and his sun withdrew its light. To the pride of his uplifted thought Much woe the weary knowledge brought That the pleasant way his feet did wend Was all passed o'er and had an end. The day wherein his years had begun Went in his mouth with a malison. As the ill grew stronger and more strong, There was but hope bore him along: Even yet to hope he was full fain That gold might help him back again Thither whence God had cast him out. Ah! weak to strive and little stout 'Gainst Heaven the strength that he possess'd. North and south, and east and west, Far and wide from every side, Mediciners well proved and tried Came to him at the voice of his woe; But, mused and pondered they everso, They could but say, for all their care, That he must be content to bear The burthen of the anger of God: For him there was none other road. Already was his heart nigh down, When yet to him one chance was shown; For in Salerno dwelt, folk said, A leach who still might lend him aid, Albeit unto his body's cure All such had been as nought before. Up rose fresh-hearted the sick man, And sought the great physician, And told him all, and prayed him hard, With the proffer of a rich reward, To take away his grief's foul cause. Then said the leach without a pause, “There is one means might healing yield, Yet will you ever be unheal'd.” And Henry said, “Say on; define Your thoughts; your words are as thick wine. Some means may bring recovery?— I will recover! Verily, Unto your will my will shall bend, So this mine anguish pass and end.” Then said the leach, “Give ear to me: Thus stands it with your misery. Albeit there be a means of health, From no man shall you win such wealth; Many have it, yet none will give; You shall lack it all the days you shall live;— Strength gets it not; valour gains it not; Nor with gold nor with silver is it bought. Then, since God heedeth not your plaint, Accept God's will and be content.” “Woe's me!” did Henry's speech begin; “Your pastime do you take herein, To snatch the last hope from my sight? Riches are mine, and mine is might,— Why cast away such golden chance As waiteth on my deliverance? You shall grow rich in succouring me: Tell me the means, what they may be.” Quoth the leach, “Then know them, what they are; Yet still all hope must stand afar. Truly if the cure for your care Might be gotten anyway anywhere, Did it hide in the furthest parts of earth, This-wise I had not sent you forth. But all my knowledge hath none avail; There is but one thing would not fail:— An innocent virgin for to find, Chaste, and modest, and pure in mind, Who, to save you from death, might choose Her own young body's life to lose: The heart's blood of the excellent maid— That and nought else can be your aid. But there is none will be won thereby For the love of another's life to die.” 'Twas then poor Henry knew indeed That from his ill he might not be freed, Sith that no woman he might win Of her own will to act herein. Thus gat he but an ill return For the journey he made unto Salerne, And the hope he had upon that day Was snatched from him and rent away. Homeward he hied him back: full fain With limbs in the dust he would have lain. Of his substance—lands and riches both— He rid himself; even as one doth Who the breath of the last life of his hope Once and for ever hath rendered up. To his friends he gave, and to the poor; Unto God praying evermore The spirit that was in him to save, And make his bed soft in the grave. What still remained, aside he set For Holy Church's benefit. Of all that heretofore was his Nought held he for himself, I wis, Save one small house, with byre and field: There from the world he lived conceal'd,— There lived he and awaited Death, Who, being awaited, lingereth. Pity and ruth his troubles found Alway through all the country round. Who heard him named, had sorrow deep, And for his piteous sake would weep. PART II The little farm, with herd and field, Now, as it had been erst, was till'd By a poor man of simple make Whose heart right seldom had the ache. A happy soul, and well content With every chance that fortune sent, Being equal in fortune's pitch Even unto him that is rich,— For that his master's kindly will Set limit to his labour still, And without cumbrance and in peace He lived upon the field's increase. With him poor Henry, trouble-press'd, Dwelt, and to dwell with him was rest. In grateful wise, neglecting nought, Still was the peasant's service wrought: Cheerily, both in heart and look, The trouble and the toil he took, Which, new as each day dawned anew, For Henry he must bear and do. With favour which to blessings ran, God looked upon the worthy man: He gave him strength to aid his life, A sturdy heart, an honest wife, And children such as bring to be That a man's breast is brimmed with glee. Among them was a little maid, Red-cheeked, in yellow locks arrayed, Whose tenth year was just passing her; With eyes most innocently clear, Sweet smiles that soothe, sweet tones that lull; Of gracious semblance wonderful. For her sick lord the dear good child Was full of tender thoughts and mild. Rarely from sitting at his feet She rose; because his speech was sweet, To serve him she was proud and glad. Great fear her little playmates had At the sight of the loathly wight; But she, as often as she might, Went to him and with him would stay; And her heart unto him alway Clave as a child's heart cleaves: his pain And grief that ever must remain, With childish grace she soothed the while, And sat her at his feet with a smile. And Henry loved the little one Who had such thought his woes upon, And he would buy her baubles bright Such as to children give delight: Nought else to peace his heart could lift Like her innocent gladness at the gift. A riband sometimes, broad and fair, To twine with the tresses of her hair, Or a looking-glass, or a little ring, Or a girdle-clasp;—at anything She was so thankful, was so pleased, That in some sort his pain was eased, And he would even say jestingly, His own good little wife was she. Seldom she left him long alone, Winning him from his inward moan With love and childish trustfulness; Her joyous seeming ne'er grew less; She was a balm unto his breast,— Unto his eyes she was shade and rest. Already were three years outwrung, And still his torment o'er him hung, And still in death ceased not his life. It chanced the peasant and his wife, And his two little daughters, sate Together when the day was late, Their talk was all upon their lord, And how the help they could afford Was joy to them, and of the woe They suffered for his sake,—yet how His death, they feared, might bring them worse. They thought that in the universe No lord could be so good as he, And if but once they lived to see Another inherit of their friend, That all their welfare needs must end. Then to his lord the peasant spake. “Question, dear master, I would make, So you permit me, of the cause Wherefore thus long you have made pause From seeking help from such as win Worship by lore of medicine, And famous are both near and far. One such might yet break down the bar That shuts you from your health's estate. Wherefore, dear master, should you wait?” Then sighs from the soul of the sick man Pressed outward, and his tears began; They were so sore, that when he spake It seemed as though his heart would break. “From God this woful curse,” he said, “Wofully have I merited, Whose mind but to world-vanity Looked, and but thought how best to be Wondrous in the thinking of men: Worship I laboured to attain By wealth, which God in His great views Had given me for another use. God's self I had well-nigh forgot, The moulder of my human lot, Whose gifts, ill ta'en, though well bestow'd, Hindered me from the heaven-road; Till I at length, lost here as there, Am chosen unto shame and despair, His wrath's insufferable weight Made me to know Him—but too late. From bad to worse, from worse to worst, At length I am cast forth and curs'd: The whole world from my side doth flee; The wretchedest insulteth me; Looking on me, each ruffian Accounts himself the better man, And turns his visage from the sight, As though I brought him bane and blight. Therefore may God reward thee, thou Who dost bear with me even now, Not scorning him whose sore distress No more may guerdon faithfulness. And yet, however kind and true The deeds thy goodness bids thee do,— Still, spite of all, it must at heart Rejoice thee when my breath shall part. How am I outcast and forlorn!— That I, who as thy lord was born, Must now beseech thee of thy grace To suffer me in mine evil case. With a great blessing verily Thou shalt be blest of God through me, Because to me, whom God thus tries, Pity thou grantest, Christian-wise. The thing thou askest thou shalt know:— All the physicians long ago Who might bring help in any kind I sought;—but, woe is me! to find That all the help in all the earth Avails not and is nothing worth. One means there is indeed, and yet That means nor gold nor prayers may get:— A leach who is full of lore hath said How it needeth that a virtuous maid For my sake with her life should part, And feel the steel cut to her heart: Only in the blood of such an one My curse may cease beneath the sun. But such an one what hope can show, Who her own life would thus forego To save my life? Then let despair Bow down within my soul to bear The wrath God's justice doth up-pile. When will death come? Woe, woe the while!” Of these, poor Henry's words, each word The little maiden likewise heard Who at his feet would always sit; And forgot it not, but remember'd it. In the hid shrine, her heart's recess, She held his words in silentness. As the mind of an angel was her mind, Grave and holy and Christ-inclin'd. When in their chamber, day being past, Her parents, after toil, slept fast,— Then always with the self-same stir The sighs of her grief troubled her. At the foot of her parents' bed Lying, so many tears she shed (Bitter and many) as to make That they woke up and kept awake. Her secret grieving once perceived, They made much marvel why she grieved, And questioned her of the evil chance To which she gave sorrowful utterance In her sobbings and in her under-cries: But nothing answered she anywise, Until her father bade her tell Openly and truly and well Why night by night within her bed So many bitter tears she shed. “Alack!” quoth she, “what should it be But our kind master's misery— With thoughts how soon we now must miss Both him and all our happiness? Our solace shall be ours no more: There is no lord alive, be sure, Who, like unto him and of his worth, Shall bless our days with peace thenceforth.” They answering said: “Right words and rare Thou speak'st; but it booteth not an hair That we should make outcry and lament: Brood thou no longer thereanent. Unto us it is pain, as unto thee, Perchance even more; yet what can we That may avail for succouring? Truly the Lord hath done this thing.” Thus silenced they her speaking; but Her soul's complaint they silenced not. Grief lay with her from hour to hour Through the long night; nor dawn had power To rid her of it; all beside That near and about her might betide Seemed nought. And when sleep covered men, Again and again, and yet again, Wakeful and faithful, she would crouch Wearily on her little couch, Tossing in trouble without sign: And from her eyes the scalding brine Flowed through sick grief that wept apart; As steadfastly within her heart She pondered on her heart's sore ache And on those words Earl Henry spake. Long with herself communing so, Her tears were softened in their flow; Because at length her will was fix'd To stand his fate and him betwixt. Where now should such a child be sought, Thinking even as this one thought, Who, rather than her lord should die, Chose her own death and held thereby? But once her purpose settled fast, All woe went forth from her and pass'd; Her heart sat lightly in her breast, And one thing only gave unrest. Her lord's own hand, she feared, might stay Her footsteps from the terrible way,— She feared her parents strength might lack, And, through much loving, hold her back. By reason of such fears, she fell Into new grief unspeakable, And that night, as the past nights, wept, Waking her father where he slept. “Thou foolish child,” thus did he say, “Why wilt thou weep thine eyes away For what no help thou hast can mend? Is not this moan thou mak'st to end? We would sleep; let us sleep in peace.” Thus chidingly he bade her cease, Because his thought conceived in nought The thing she had laid up in her thought. Answered him the excellent maid: “Truly my own dear lord hath said That by one means he may be heal'd. So ye but your consenting yield, It is my blood that he shall have. I, being virgin-pure, to save His days, do choose the edge o'the knife, And my death rather than my life.” The young girl's parents lay and heard, And had sore grief of her spoken word; And thus her father said: “How now? What silly wish, child, wishest thou? Thou durst not do it in very truth. What knows a child of these things, forsooth? Ugly Death thou hast never seen: Were he once to near thee, I ween— Didst thou view the pit of the sepulchre— Thy face would change and thy flesh fear, And thy soul within thee would shake, And thy weak hands would toil to break The grasp of the monster foul and grim, Drawing thee from thyself to him. Leave thy words and thy weeping too; What cannot be done, seek not to do.” “Nay, father mine,” replied the child, “Though my words may be counted wild, Well I know that the body's death Is a torture and tortureth. Yet truly this is truth no less: He who is plagued with sharp distress, Who hates his life, having but woe,— To him the end cometh, even so, When for all the curses that he hath pass'd, He 'scapes not the curse of death at last. What booteth it him a long-drawn life To have traversed in trouble and in strife, If nothing after all he can win, Except, being old, to enter in At the self-same door which years ago He might more firmly have passed through? But scantly may the soul see good,— So rough is world-driving and so rude; And, good once ended, hope once lorn, Best it were I had not been born. Therefore my lips give praise to God, Who this great blessing hath bestow'd On me,—by loss of body and limb To have the life that lives with Him. 'Twere ill done, did ye make me loth From what unto me and unto both Bringeth joy and prosperity, Gaining the crown of Christ for me; And you, from every troublous thing That threateneth you, delivering. The generous master ye shall keep Who leaves you undisturbed to reap The fruits our little field doth grow, Earn'd, father, in the sweat of thy brow. With you, while he liveth, it shall stay; He is good; he will not drive you away. But if we now should let him die, Our ruining hasteneth thereby: The thought whereof doth make me give My own young life that he may live. To such a choice, which profits all, Meseems your chiding should be small.” Then the mother broke forth at last, Finding her daughter's purpose fast. “Think, my own child,—daughter mine, think Of the bitter cup that I had to drink, Of the pain that I suffered once for thee; And, thinking, turn thyself unto me. Is this the guerdon thou dost give Even to the womb that bade thee live? Her in pain must I lose again Whom I bore and brought forth in pain? Wouldst leave thy parents for thy lord? This were hatred of God and of His word. Clean from thy mind is the word gone Which God pronounced? Ponder thereon: ‘Listen,’ it is written, ‘to their command, That thy days may be long in the land.’ Lo! how corrupt must be thine heart!— It hath striven the will of God to thwart. And sayest thou, if thou losest thus Thy life, good hap shall come to us? Oh no! in us thou wilt give birth To weariness and to scorn of earth. In the whole world thou art alone That which our joy is set upon. Yes, little daughter, always dear, 'Tis thou shouldst make our gladness here; Thou shouldst be a lamp to our life, Our aim in the troublesome hard strife, And a staff our falling steps to save: In place whereof, thine own black grave With thine own hand thou digg'st, and sad Grow the hope and the comfort that we had, And I must weep at thy tomb all day Till in plague and torment I pass away. Yet oh! whate'er our ills may be, So much and more shall God do to thee.” Then the pious maid answered and said:— “O mother, that in my soul art laid, How should I not at all times here See the path of my duty clear, When at all times my thankful mind Meeteth thy love, tender and kind, That kindly and tenderly ministers? Of a verity I am young in years; Yet this I know: what is mine, to wit, Is mine but since thou gavest it. And if the people grant me praise, And look with favour in my face, Yet my heart's tale is continual— That only thee must I thank for all Which it pleaseth them to perceive in me; And that ne'er a thing should be brought to be By myself on myself, save such As thou wouldst permit without reproach. Mother, it was thou that didst give These limbs and the life wherewith I live,— And is it thou wouldst grudge my soul Its white robe and its aureole? The knowledge of evil in my breast Hath not yet been, nor sin's unrest; Therefore, the road being overtrod, I know I shall have portion with God. Say not that this is foolishness; No hand but God's hand is in this: Him must thou thank, Whose grace doth cleanse My heart from earth's desire, till hence It longs with a mighty will to go Ere sin be known that's yet to know. Well it needs that the joys of earth (Deemed oftentimes of a priceless worth By man should be counted excellent: How otherwise might he rest content With anything but Christ's perfecting? Oh! to such reeds let me not cling! God knows how vain seem to my sight The bliss of this world and the delight; For the delight turneth amiss, And soul's tribulation hath the bliss. What is their life?—a gasp for breath; And their guerdon?—but the burthen of death. One thing alone is sure:—should peace Come to-day, with to-morrow it shall cease; Till the last evil thing at last Shall find us out, and our days be past. Nor birth nor wealth succoureth then, Nor strength, nor the courage of strong men, Nor honour, nor fealty, nor truth. Out and alack! our life, our youth, Are but dust only and empty smoke; We are laden branches that the winds rock. Woe to the fool who layeth hold On earth's vain shadows manifold! The marsh-fire gleam, as it hath shone, Still shines, luring his footsteps on: But he is dead ere he reach the goal, And with his flesh dieth his soul. Therefore, dear mother, be at rest, And labour not to make manifest That for my sake thou hold'st me here: But let one silence make it clear That my father's will is joined with thine. Alas! though I kept this life of mine 'Tis verily but a little while That ye may smile, or that I may smile. Two years perchance, perchance even three, In happiness I shall keep with ye: Then must our lord be surely dead, And sorrow and sighing find us instead; And your want shall your will withhold From giving me any dowry-gold, And no man will take me for his wife; And my life shall be trouble-rife, And very hateful, and worse than death. Or though this thing that threateneth Were 'scaped, and ere our good lord died Some bridegroom chose me for his bride,— Though then, ye think, all is made smooth, Yet the bad is but made worse, forsooth; For even with love, woes should not cease, And not to love were the end of peace. Thus through ill and grief I struggle still, What to attain? Even grief and ill. In this strait, One would set me free, My soul and my body asking of me, That I may be with Him where He is. Hold me not; I would make myself His. He only is the true Husbandman; The labour ends well which He began; Ever His plough goeth aright; His barns fill; for His fields there is no blight; In His lands life dies not anywhere; Never a child sorroweth there; There heat is not, neither is cold; There the lapse of years maketh not old; But peace hath its dwelling there for aye, And abideth, and shall not pass away. Thither, yea, thither let me go, And be rid of this shadow-place below,— This place laid waste like a waste plain, Where nothing is but torment and pain, Where a day's blight falleth upon The work of a year, and it is gone; Where ruinous thunder lifts its voice, And where the harvest may not rejoice. You love me? Oh let your love be seen, And labour no more to circumvene My heart's desire for the happy place! To the Lord let me lift my face,— Even unto Jesus Christ my Friend, Whose gracious mercies have no end, In whose name Love is the world's dear Lord, And by whom not the vilest is abhorr'd. Alike with Him is man's estate,— As the rich the poor, the small as the great: Were I a queen, be sure that He With more joy could not welcome me. Yet from your hearts do I turn my heart? Nay, from your love I will not part, But rejoice to be subject unto you. Then count not my thought to be untrue Because I deem, if I do this thing, It is your weal I am furthering. Whoso, men say, another's pelf Heaping, pulls want upon himself,— Whoso his neighbour's fame would crown By bringing ruin upon his own,— His friendship is surely overmuch. But this my purpose is none such: For though ye too shall gain relief, It is myself I would serve in chief. O mother dear, weep not, nor mourn: My duty is this; let it be borne. Take heart,—thou hast other children left; In theirs thy life shall be less bereft; They shall comfort thee for the loss of me: Then my own gain let me bring to be, And my lord's; for to him upon the earth This only can be of any worth. Nor think that thou shalt look on my grave; That pain, at least, thou canst never have; Very far away is the land Where that must be done which I have plann'd. God guerdoneth; in God is my faith; He shall loosen me from the bonds of Death.” PART III All trembling had the parents heard Death by their daughter thus preferr'd With a language so very marvellous (Surely no child reasoneth thus), Whose words between her lips made stir, As though the Spirit were poured on her Which giveth knowledge of tongues unknown. So strange was every word and tone, They knew not how they might answer it, Except by striving to submit To Him Who had made the child's heart rife With the love of death and the scorn of life. Therefore they said, silently still, “All-perfect One, it is Thy will.” With fear and doubt's most bitter ban They were a-cold; so the poor man And the poor woman sat alway In their bed, without yea or nay. Ever alack! they had no speech The new dawn of their thought to reach. With a wild sorrow unrepress'd The mother caught the child to her breast; But the father after long interval Said, though his soul smote him withal, “Daughter, if God is in thine heart, Heed not our grieving, but depart.” Then the sweet maid smiled quietly; And soon i'the morning hastened she To the room where the sick man slept. Up to his bed she softly stepp'd, Saying, “Do you sleep, my dear lord?” “No, little wife,” was his first word, “But why art thou so early to-day?” “Grief made that I could not keep away— The great grief that I have for you.” “God be with thee, faithful and true! Often to ease my suffering Thou hast done many a gracious thing. But it lasteth; it shall be always so.” Then said the girl: “On my troth, no! Take courage and comfort; it will turn, The fire that in your flesh doth burn One means, you know, would quench at once. My mind climbs to conclusions. Not a day will I make delay, Now I am 'ware of the one way. Dear lord, I have heard yourself expound How, if only a maiden could be found To lose her life for you willingly, From all your pains you might yet be free. God He knoweth, I will do this: My worth is not as yours, I wis.” Wondering and sore astonièd, The poor sick man looked at the maid, Whose face smiled down unto his face, While the tears gave each other chase Over his cheeks from his weary eyes, Till he made answer in this wise:— “Trust me, this death is not, my child, So tender a trouble and so mild As thou, in thy reckoning, reckonest. Thou didst keep madness from my breast, And help me when other help was none: I thank thee for all that thou hast done. (May God unto thee be merciful For thy tenderness in the day of dule!) I know thy mind, childlike and chaste, And the innocent spirit that thou hast; But nothing more will I ask of thee Than thou without wrong mayst do for me. Long ago have I given up The strife for deliverance and the hope; So that now in thy faithfulness I pleasure me with a soul at peace, Wishing not thy sweet life withdrawn Sith my own life I have foregone. Too suddenly, little wife, beside, Like a child's, doth thine heart decide On this which hath enter'd into it,— Unsure if thou shalt have benefit. In little space sore were thy case If once with Death thou wert face to face; And heavy and dark would the thing seem Which thou hast desirèd in thy dream. Therefore, good child, go in again: Soon, I know, thou wilt count as vain This thing to which thy mind is wrought, When once thou hast ponder'd in thy thought How hard a thing it is to remove From the world and from the home of one's love. And think too what a grievous smart Hereby must come to thy parents' heart, And how bitter to them would be the stroke. Shall I bring this thing on the honest folk By whose pity my woes have been beguiled? To thy parents' counselling, my child, For evermore look that thou incline: So sorrow of heart shall not be thine.” When thus he had answer'd tenderly, Forth came the parents, who hard by Had hearken'd to the speech that he spake. Albeit his heart was nigh to break With the load under which it bow'd, The father spake these words aloud: “God knows,” said he, “we do willingly, Dear master, aught that may vantage thee Who hast been so good to us and so kind. If God have in very truth design'd That this young child should for thee atone,— Then, being God's will, let it be done. Yea, through His power she hath been brought To count the years of her youth for nought; And by no childish whim is she led To her grave, as thou hast imaginèd. To-day, alack! is the third day That with prayers we might not put away She hath sorely entreated us that we Would grant her the grace to die for thee. By her words exceeding wonderful, Our sharp resistance hath waxed dull, Till now we may no longer dare To pause from the granting of her prayer.” When the sick man thus found that each Spoke with good faith the selfsame speech, And that in earnest the young maid Proffered her life for his body's aid,— There rose, the little room within, Of sobbing and sorrow a great din, And a strange dispute, that side and this, In manner as there seldom is. The Earl, at length winning unto The means of health, raised much ado, Loudly lamenting that his cure From sickness should be thus made sure. The parents grieved with a bitter woe That their dear child should leave them so, While yet they pray'd of him constantly To grant her prayer that she should die. And she meanwhile whose life-long years It was to cost, shed sorrowful tears For dread lest he whom she would save Should deny to her the boon of the grave. Thus they who, in pure faith's control And in the strength of a godly soul, Vied one with the other, sat there now, Their eyes all wet with the bitter flow, Each urging of what he had to say, None yielding at all, nor giving way. The sick man sat in thought a space, Between his hands bowing his face, While the others, with supplicating tone, Softly besought him one by one. Then his head at last he lifted up, And let his tears fall without stop, And said finally: “So let it be. Shall I, who am one, stand against three? Now know I surely that God's word, Which speaks in silence, ye have heard; And that this thing must be very fit, And even as God hath appointed it. He, seeing my heart, doth read thereon That I yield but to Him alone,— Not to the wish that for my sake Her grave this gracious child should make.” Then the maid sprang to him full fain, As though she had gotten a great gain; And both his feet clasp'd and would kiss,— Not for sorrow sobbing now, but for bliss: The while her sorrowing parents went Forth from that room to make lament, And weep apart for the heavy load Which yet they knew was the will of God. Then a kirtle was given unto the maid, Broider'd all with the silken braid, Such as never before she had put on; With sables the border was bedone, And with jewels bound about and around: On her so fair they were fairer found Than song of mine can make discourse. And they mounted her on a goodly horse: That horse was to carry her very far,— Even to the place where the dead are. In the taking of these gifts she smil'd. Not any longer a silly child She seemed, but a worshipful damozel, Well begotten and nurtured well. And her face had a quiet earnestness; And while she made ready, none the less Did she comfort the trouble-stricken pair, Who in awestruck wise looked on her there, As a saintly being superior And no daughter unto them any more. Yet when the bitter moment came Wherein their child must depart from them, In sooth it was hard to separate. The mother's grief was heavy and great, Seeing that child lost to her, whom, Years since, she had carried in her womb. And the father was sorely shaken too, Now nought remained but to bid adieu To that young life, full of the spring, Which must wither before the blossoming. What made the twain more strong at length Was the young girl's wonderful strength, Whose calm look and whose gentle word Blunted the sharp point of the sword. With her mouth she was eloquent, As if to her ear an angel bent, Whispering her that she might say The word which wipes all tears away. Thus, with her parents' benison Upon her head, forth is she gone:— She is gone forth like to a bride, Lifted and inwardly glorified; She seemed not as one that journeyeth To the door of the house of death. So they rode without stop or turn By the paths that take unto Salerne. Lo! he is riding to new life Whose countenance is laden and rife With sorrow and care and great dismay. But for her who rides the charnel-way— Oh! up in her eyes sits the bright look Which tells of a joy without rebuke. With friendly speech, with cheerful jest, She toils to give his sorrow rest, To lighten the heavy time for him, And shorten the road that was long and grim. Thus on their way they still did wend Till they were come to their journey's end. Then prayed she of him that they might reach That day the dwelling of the wise leach Who had shown how his ill might be allay'd. And it was done even as she said. His arm in hers, went the sick man Unto the great physician, And brought again to his mind the thing Whereof they had erst made questioning. “This maid,” he said, “holds purpose now To work my cure, as thy speech did show.” But the leach held silence, as one doth Whose heart to believe is well-nigh loth, Even though his eyes witness a thing. At length he said: “By whose counselling Comes this, my child? Hast thou thought well On that whereof this lord doth tell, Or art thou led perforce thereto?” “Nay,” quoth the maid, “that which I do, I do willingly; none persuadeth me; It is, because I choose it should be.” He took her hand, silently all, And led her through a door in the wall Into another room that was there, Wherein he was quite alone with her. Then thus: “Thou poor ill-guided child, What is it that maketh thee so wild, Thy short life and thy little breath Suddenly to yield up to death? An thou art constrain'd, e'en say 'tis so, And I swear to thee thou art free to go. Remember this—how that thy blood Unto the Earl can bring no good If thou sheddest it with an inward strife. Vain it were to bleed out thy life, If still, when the whole hath come to pass, Thy lord should be even as he was. Bethink thee—and consider thereof— How the pains thou tempt'st are hard and rough. First, with thy limbs naked and bare Before mine eyes thou must appear,— So needs shall thy maiden shame be sore: Yet still must the woe be more and more, What time thou art bound by heel and arm, And with sharp hurt and with grievous harm I cut from out thy breast the part That is most alive—even thine heart. With thine eyes thou shalt surely see The knife ere it enter into thee,— Thou shalt feel worse than death's worst sting Ere the heart be drawn forth quivering. How deemest thou? Canst thou suffer this? Alack, poor wretch! there is dreadfulness Even in the thought. If only once Thou do blench or shrink when the blood runs— If thou do repent but by an hair,— It is bootless all,—in vain the care, In vain the scathe, in vain the death. Now what is the word thy free choice saith?” She look'd at him as at a friend, And answer'd: “Sir, unto that end— To wit, my choice—I had ponder'd hard Long ere I was borne hitherward. I thank you, sir, that of your heart's ruth You have warn'd me thus; and of a truth, By all the words that you have said I well might feel dispirited,— The more that even yourself, meseems, Are frightened by these idle dreams From the work you should perform for the Earl. Oh! it might hardly grace a girl Such cowardly reasoning to use! Pardon me, sir; I cannot choose But laugh, that you, with your mastership, Should have a courage less firm and deep Than a pitiful maiden without lore Whose life even now ends and is o'er. The part that is yours dare but to do,— As for me, I have trust to undergo. Methinks the dule and the drearihead You tell me of, must be sharp indeed, Sith the mere thought is so troublesome. Believe me, I never should have come, Had I not known of myself alone What the thing was to be undergone,— Were I not sure that, abash'd no whit, This soul of mine could be through with it. Yea, verily, by your sorrowing, My poor heart's courage you can bring Just to such sorrowful circumstance As though I were going to the dance. Worshipful sir, there nothing is That can last alway without cease,— Nought that one day's remitted doom Can save the feeble body from. Thus then, you see, it is cheerfully That I do all this; and that while he My lord, you willing, shall not die, The endless life shall be mine thereby. Resolve you, and so it shall be said That the fame you have is well merited. This brings me joy that I undertake, Even for my dear kind master's sake, And for what we two shall gain also,— I, there above,—and you, here below. Sir, inasmuch as the work is hard, So much the more is our great reward.” Then the leach said nothing, but was dumb; And, marvelling much, he sought the room Where the sick man sat in expectancy. “New courage may be yours,” quoth he; “For your sake she casts her life behind, Not from empty fantasy of the mind; And the parting of her body and soul Shall cleanse your limbs and make you whole.” But Henry was full of troublous thought; Peradventure he hearken'd not, For he answer'd not that which was sain. So the leach turn'd, and went out again. Again to the maid did he repair, And straightway lock'd the doors with care, That Henry might not see or know What she for his sake must undergo. And the leach said, “Take thy raiment off.” Then was her heart joyous enough, And she obey'd, and in little space Stood up before the old man's face As naked as God had fashion'd her: Only her innocence clothèd her: She fear'd not, and was not asham'd, In the sight of God standing unblamed, To whom her dear life without price She offered up for a sacrifice. When thus she was beheld of the leach, His soul spake with an inward speech, Saying that beauty so excellent Had scarce been known since the world went. And he conceived for the poor thing Such an unspeakable pitying, And such a fear on his purpose lit, That he scarce dared to accomplish it. Slowly he gave her his command To lie down on a table hard at hand, To the which he bound her with strong cords: Then he reach'd his hand forth afterwards, And took a broad long knife, and tried The edge of the same on either side. It was sharp, yet not as it should be (He looked to its sharpness heedfully,— Having sore grief for the piteous scathe, And desiring to shorten her death). Therefore it was he took a stone, And ground the knife finely thereon. Earl Henry heard in bitterest woe The blade, a-whetting, come and go. Forward he sprang; a sudden start Of grief for the maid struck to his heart. He thought what a peerless soul she bore,— And made a great haste unto the door, And would have gone in, but it was shut. Then his eyes burn'd, as he stood without, In scalding tears; transfigurèd He felt himself; and in the stead Of his feebleness there was mightiness. “Shall she,” he thought, “who my life doth bless,— The gracious, righteous, virtuous maid,— To this end be thrust down to the shade? Wilt thou, thou fool, force the Most High, That thy desire may come thereby? Deem'st thou that any, for good or ill, Can live but a day against His will? And if by His will thou yet shalt live, What more of help can her dying give? Sith all then is as God ordereth, Rest evermore in the hand of faith. As in past time, anger not now The All-powerful; seeing that thou Canst anger Him only. 'Tis the ways Of penitence lead unto grace.” He was determined immediately, And smote on the door powerfully, And cried to the leach, “Open to me!” But the leach answer'd, “It may not be: I have something of weight that I must do.” Then Henry urged back upon him, “No! Come quickly, and open, and give o'er.” Quoth the other, “Say your say through the door.” “Not so, not so; let me enter in: It is my soul's rest I would win.” Then the door drew back, widely and well; And Henry look'd on the damozel, Where she lay bound, body and limb, Waiting Death's stroke, to conquer him. “Hear me,” said he, “worshipful sir; It is horrible thus to look on her: Rather the burthen of God's might I choose to suffer, than this sight. What I have said, that will I give; But let thou the brave maiden live.” PART IV When the maiden learn'd assuredly That by that death she was not to die, And when she was loosed from the strong bands, A sore moan made she. With her hands She rent her hair; and such were her tears That it seem'd a great wrong had been hers. “Woe worth the weary time!” she cried; “There is no pity on any side. Woe is me! It fades from my view— The recompense I was chosen to,— The magnificent heaven-crown I hoped with such a hope to put on. Now it is I am truly dead,— Now it is I am truly ruinèd. Oh! shame and sorrowing on me, And shame and sorrowing on thee, Who the guerdon from my spirit hast riven, And by whose hands I am snatch'd from Heaven! Lo! he chooseth his own calamity, That so my crown may be reft from me!” Then with sharp prayer she pray'd them there That still the death might be given her For the which she had journey'd many a mile. But being assured in a brief while That the thing she sought would be denied, She gazed with a piteous mien, and cried, Rebuking her heart-beloved lord— “Is all then lost that my soul implor'd? How faint art thou, how little brave, To load me with this load that I have! How have I been cheated with lies, And cozen'd with fair-seeming falsities! They told me thou wast honest, and good, And valiant, and full of noble blood,— The which, so help me God! was false. Thou art one the world strangely miscalls. Thou art but a weak timorous man, Whose soul, affrighted, fails to scan The strength of a woman's sufferance. Have I injured thee anyway, perchance? Say, how didst thou hear, sitting without? And yet meseems the wall was stout Betwixt us. Nay, but thou must know That it is to be—that it will be so. Take heed—there is no second one Who yet for thy life will lose her own. Oh! turn to me and be pitiful, And grudge not death to my poor soul!” But though her sueing was hard and hot, His firmness never fail'd him a jot; So that at length, against her will, She needs must end her cries and be still,— Yielding her to the loath'd decree That made her life a necessity. Lord Henry to one will was wrought, Fast settled in his steadfast thought: He clothed her again with his own hand, And again set forth to his native land, Having given large reward to the leach. He knew the shame and the evil speech And the insult he must bear,—yet bow'd Meekly thereto; knowing that God Had will'd, in his regard, each thing That wrought for him weal or suffering. Thus by the damsel's help indeed From a foul sickness he was freed,— Not from his body's sore and smart, But from hardness and stubbornness of heart. Then first was all that pride of his Quite overthrown; a better bliss Came to his soul and dwelt with him Than the bliss he had in the first time,— To wit, a blithe heart's priceless gain That looks to God through the tears of pain. But as they rode, the righteous maid Mourn'd and might not be comforted. Her soul was aghast, her heart was waste, Her wits were all confused and displac'd: Herseem'd that the leaning on God's might Was turn'd for her to shame and despite: So her pure heart ceased not to pray That the woe she had might be ta'en away. Thus came the girl and the sick wight To an hostel at the fall of the night. Each in a little chamber alone, They watch'd till many hours were gone. The nobleman gave thanks to God Who had turn'd him from the profitless road, And cleansed him, by care and suffering, From his loftiness and vain-glorying. The damsel went down on her knees And spake to God such words as these,— Why thus He had put aside, and left Out of His grace, her and her gift,— Seeing how she had nothing more To give but her one life bare and poor. She prayed: “Am I not good enough, Thou Holy One, to partake thereof? Then, O my God! cleanse Thou mine heart; Let me not thus cease and depart: Give me a sign, Father of mine, That the absolving grace divine By seeking may at length be found While yet this earth shall hold me round.” And God, who lifts souls from the dust, Nor turns from the spirit that hath trust, The same look'd down with looks unloth On the troublesome sorrow of them both, Both whose hearts and whose life-long days He had won to Him for glory and praise,— Who had passed through the fire and come forth And proved themselves salvation-worth. The Father—He who comforteth His patient children that have faith— At length released these steadfast ones From their manifold tribulations. In wondrous wise the Earl was stripp'd Of all his sickness while he slept; And when, as the sunrise smote his e'en, He found him once more whole and clean, He rose from his couch and sought the maid. On the sight for which she long had pray'd, She gazed and gazed some speechless space And then knelt down with lifted face And said, “The Lord God hath done this: His was the deed—the praise be His. With solemn thinking let me take The life which He hath given me back.” PART V The Earl return'd in joyful case Unto his fathers' dwelling-place. Every day brought back to him A part of his joy, which had waxed dim; And he grew now, of face and mien, More comely than ever he had been. And unto all who in former years Had been his friends and his comforters, He told how God's all-mercifulness Had deliver'd him out of his distress. And they rejoiced, giving the praise To God and His unsearchable ways. Then thitherward full many a road Men came, a gladsome multitude; They came in haste, they rode and they ran, To welcome the gallant gentleman; Their own eyes they could scarce believe, Beholding him in health and alive. A strange sight, it may well be said, When one revives that was counted dead. The worthy peasant who so long Had tended him when the curse was strong, In the good time stay'd not away, Nor his wife could be brought to stay. 'Twas then that after long suspense Their labour gat its recompense. They who had hoped no other thing Than the sight of their lord, on entering Saw the sweet damsel by his side, In perfect measure satisfied, Who caught them round with either arm, And clave to them closely and warm. Long time they kissed her, in good sooth— They kissed her on her cheeks and mouth. Within their breasts their hearts were light; And eyes which first laughed and were bright Soon overbrimmed with many tears, The tokens of the joy that was theirs. Then the good honest Swabians Who erst had shared the inheritance Of the sick lord, gave back the land, Unasked, which they had ta'en at his hand. Him did they wholly reinstate In every title and estate That heretofore he had possess'd. But ever he pondered in his breast Upon those wondrous things which once God wrought on his flesh and in his bones. Nor did he in anywise forget The friendly pair whose help, ere yet His hours of pain were overpast, Had stood him in such stead. The taste Of bitter grief he had brought on them Found such reward as best became— He gave the little farm and the field, With the cattle whereby they were till'd, With servants eke, to the honest twain; So that no fears plagued them again Lest any other lord should come At length and turn them from their home. Also his thankful favour stay'd Evermore with the pious maid: Many a day with her he spent, And gave her many an ornament, Because of what is said in my rhyme And the love he bore her from old time. Thus, it may be, a year went o'er: Then all his kinsfolk urged him sore Some worthy woman for to woo, And bring her as his wife thereto. And he answer'd, “Truly as I live, This is good counsel that ye give.” So he summoned every lord his friend, That to this matter they might bend Such help as honest friends can bring. And they all came at his summoning, Everywhence, both far and near; And eke his whole vassalage was there,— Not a single man but was come: It made, good sooth, a mighty sum. And the earl stepp'd forward in their sight, Saying, “Sirs, my mind is fixed aright To wed even as your wills decide: Take counsel then, and choose me a bride.” So they got together and began; But there was a mind for every man. Both ways they wrangled, aye and no, As counsellors are sure to do. Then again he spake to them and cried: “Dear friends, now let alone the bride, And rede me a thing. All of ye know, Doubtless, that I, a while ago, With a most loathsome ill was cross'd, And appear'd to be altogether lost, So that all people avoided me With cursings and cruel mockery. And yet no man scorneth me now, Nor woman either; seeing how God's mercy hath made me whole again. Then tell me, I pray of ye full fain, What I may do to His honouring Who to mine aid hath done this thing.” And they all answered immediately: “By word and deed it behoveth thee To offer thyself to the Most High, And work for Him good works thereby, That the life He spared may be made His.” “Then,” quoth the Earl, “hearken me this. The damozel who standeth here,— And whom I embrace, being most dear,— She it is unto whom I owe The grace it hath pleased God to bestow. He saw the simple-spirited Earnestness of the holy maid, And even in guerdon of her truth Gave back to me the joys of my youth, Which seem'd to be lost beyond all doubt. And therefore I have chosen her out To wed with me, knowing her free. I think that God will let this be. But now if I fail, and not obtain, I will never embrace woman again; For all I am, and all I have, Is but a gift, sirs, that she gave. Lo! I enjoin ye, with God's will, That this my longing ye fulfil: I pray ye all, have but one voice, And let your choice go with my choice.” Then the cries ceased, and the counter-cries, And all the battle of advice, And every lord, being content With Henry's choice, granted assent. Then the priests came, to bind as one Two lives in bridal unison. Into his hand they folded hers, Not to be loosed in coming years, And utter'd between man and wife God's blessing on the road of their life. Many a bright and pleasant day The twain pursued their steadfast way, Till, hand in hand, at length they trod Upward to the kingdom of God. Even as it was with them, even thus, And quickly, it must be with us. To such reward as theirs was then, God help us in His Hour. Amen. TWO SONGS FROM VICTOR HUGO'S “BURGRAVES” I [Through the long winter the rough wind tears] Through the long winter the rough wind tears; With their white garment the hills look wan. Love on: who cares? Who cares? Love on. My mother is dead; God's patience wears; It seems my chaplain will not have done. Love on: who cares? Who cares? Love on. The Devil, hobbling up the stairs, Comes for me with his ugly throng. Love on: who cares? Who cares? Love on. II [In the time of the civil broils] In the time of the civil broils Our swords are stubborn things. A fig for all the cities! A fig for all the kings! The Burgrave prospereth: Men fear him more and more. Barons, a fig for his Holiness! A fig for the Emperor! Right well we hold our own With the brand and the iron rod. A fig for Satan, Burgraves! Burgraves, a fig for God! CAPITOLO: A. M. SALVINI TO FRANCESCO REDI, 16? Know then, dear Redi, (sith thy gentle heart Would read my riddle and my mystery,)— That I am thinking from men's thoughts apart; And that I learn deeper theology While my soul travails over Dante's page, Than with long study in the schools might be. Many and many things, holy and sage, To the dim mind his mighty words unveil, Thralling it with a welcome vassalage: Nor doth his glorious lamp flicker or fail By reason of that vapoury shrouding strange, Which in like argument may much prevail. Through old and trodden paths he scorned to range; He took the leap of Chaos;—high, and low, And to the middle region's state of change. Bright things, and dubious things, and things of woe, Thence to the mind he spake with pictured speech, Making the tongue cry out, “They must be so!” The how and wherefore will be told of each; And that his soul might take its flight and roam, Beatrice gave him wings of boundless reach. O hallowed breast, the Muses' chosen home, Blest be the working of thy steadfast aim, And blest thy fancy through all time to come, Which whispers now, and now with words of flame Like sudden thunder makes the heart to pause; Whence laurel to thy brow and myrtle came. For in love-speaking, so to love's sweet laws Thy verse is subject, that no truer truth From passion's store the stricken spirit draws. But pent in Hell's huge coil, for pity and ruth Thy voice is slow and broken and profound, To the harsh echoes singing sorrowful sooth; And thy steps stumble in the weary bound;— Of that dim maze where nothing is that shines Stalking the desolate circles round and round. Then through the prisoned air which sobs and pines With Purgatorial grief, up dost thou soar To Paradise, on the sun's dazzling lines. There all the wonders thou dost reckon o'er Of that great Joy that never waxeth old,— A mighty hearing seldom heard before. To us by thee pleasures and woes are told, What path to fly from, in whose steps to tread, That from man's mind the veil may be unrolled. But oh! thine angry tones, awful and dread, What time God puts the thunder in thy mouth, Upon His foes the righteous wrath to shed! Then, then thy thoughts are of a mighty growth;— Then does the terror of His holy curse Hurtle from East to West, from North to South;— Then heavy sorrow 'ginn'st thou to rehearse;— Then Priests and Princes tremble and are pale, More than with ague shaken at thy verse. Though in thy praise all human praises fail, Even of the few who love thee and who bless,— The scoffing of the herd shall not prevail. Thy words are weights, under whose mighty stress Tyrants and evil men shall shrink and quail; True seeds of an undying perfectness. TWO LYRICS FROM NICCOLÒ TOMMASEO I.—THE YOUNG GIRL Even as a child that weeps, Lulled by the love it keeps, My grief lies back and sleeps. Yes, it is Love bears up My soul on his spread wings, Which the days would else chafe out With their infinite harassings. To quicken it, he brings The inward look and mild That thy face wears, my child. As in a gilded room Shines 'mid the braveries Some wild-flower, by the bloom Of its delicate quietness Recalling the forest-trees In whose shadow it was, And the water and the green grass:— Even so, 'mid the stale loves The city prisoneth, Thou touchest me gratefully, Like Nature's wholesome breath: Thy heart nor hardeneth In pride, nor putteth on Obeisance not its own. Not thine the skill to shut The love up in thine heart, Neither to seem more tender, Less tender than thou art. Thou dost not hold apart In silence when thy joys Most long to find a voice. Let the proud river-course, That shakes its mane and champs, Run between marble shores By the light of many lamps, While all the ooze and the damps Of the city's choked-up ways Make it their draining-place. Rather the little stream For me; which, hardly heard, Unto the flower, its friend, Whispers as with a word. The timid journeying bird Of the pure drink that flows Takes but one drop, and goes. II.—A FAREWELL I soothed and pitied thee: and for thy lips,— A smile, a word (sure guide To love that's ill to hide!) Was all I had thereof. Even as an orphan boy, whom, sore distress'd, A gentle woman meets beside the road And takes him home with her,—so to thy breast Thou didst take home my image: pure abode! 'Twas but a virgin's dream. This heart bestow'd Respect and piety And friendliness on thee: But it is poor in love. No, I am not for thee. Thou art too new, I am too old, to the old beaten way. The griefs are not the same which grieve us two: Thy thought and mine lie far apart to-day. Less than I wish, more than I hope, alway Are heart and soul in thee. Thou art too much for me, Sister, and not enough. A better and a fresher heart than mine Perchance may meet thee ere thy youth be told; Or, cheated by the longing that is thine, Waiting for life perchance thou shalt wax old. Perchance the time may come when I may hold It had been best for me To have had thy ministry On the steep path and rough. SONNET OM CECCO ANGIOLIERI In absence from Becchina I'm better skill'd to frolic on a bed Than any man that goes upon two feet; And so, when I and certain moneys meet, You'll fancy with what joys I shall be fed. Meanwhile (alas!) I can but long instead To be within her arms held close and sweet To whom without reserve and past retreat My soul and body and heart are subjected. For often, when my mind is all distraught With this whereof I make my boast, I pass The day in deaths which never seem enough; And all my blood within is boiling hot, Yet I've less strength than running water has; And this shall last as long as I'm in love. FROM THE ROMAN DE LA ROSE Tender as dew her cheeks' warm life; She was as simple as a wife, She was as white as lilies are. Her face was sweet and smooth and fair: Slender and very straight she was, And on her cheeks no paint might pass. Her fair hair was so long that it Shook, when she walked, about her feet: Eyes, nose, and mouth, were perfect art, Exceeding pain is at my heart When I remember me of her. POEMS BY FRANCESCO AND GAETANO POLIDORI [Extract from Il Losario] Silent, she lifted softly through the wave All her divine white bosom; seeming there As when Aurora, freed from night's dull cave, Fills full of roses the sweet morning air; Then, with a hand more white than snows which pave The Alps, upon their brows that water clear She shook; and, to the immediate summons sent, The monster's presence stirr'd the element. And the banks shudder'd, and the sky grew dark, As the dark river heaved with that obscene Infamous bulk: the while each knight, to mark His 'vantage, hover'd, stout in heart and mien, Around it. Watchful were their eyes, and stark Losario's onset; and yet weak, I ween, Against the constant spray of fire and smoke, Which from the dragon's lips and nostrils broke. Blinded and baffled by the hideous rain, And stunn'd with gnashing fangs and scourged with claws, Still brave Losario toils, but spends in vain His strength against the dragon without pause; Till at the last, one mighty stroke amain Within the nether rack of those foul jaws He dealt. Then fume and flame together ceased At once; and on the palpitating beast The champion fell with his strong naked hands; And right and left such iron blows struck he On that hard front, that far across the sands The deep woods utter'd echoes heavily; A noise like that when some broad roof withstands The hail-clouds under which the cattle flee. But when at length those open jaws emit A flickering tongue, the prince lays hold on it. Then Antasete, who by the creature's flank Still watch'd, obedient to the nymph, did rouse His strength, and up the rugged loins that stank Clomb on its neck, and bit it in the brows. Straight as his teeth within the forehead sank, Those execrable limbs fell ponderous; And from the wound such spilth of gore was shed, That lips, and chin, and fingers, were all red. (Canto 3, st. 28, et seq.) WINTER In this dead winter season now, Whose rigid sky is like a corpse, Awhile beneath some naked bough Here let me stand, beholding how The frost all earthly life absorbs. Yet fair the sky with clouds o'erspread, As in grey mantle garmented; While hastily or placidly The snow's white flakes descend to clothe The pleasant world and all its growth. And passing fair it is to see How hills and multitudinous woods, And trees alone in solitudes, Accept the white shroud silently; And I have watch'd and deem'd it fair, While myrtle, laurel, juniper, Slowly were hidden; while each spring, Each river, crept, an unknown thing, Beneath its crystal covering. Then shalt thou see, beside the wan Changed surface of his watery home, Stand lean and cold the famish'd swan,— One foot within his ruffled plumes Upgather'd, while his eyes will roam Around, till from the wintry glooms Beneath the wing they hopelessly Take shelter, that they may not see. And though sad thoughts within her rise At the drear sight, yet it shall soothe Thy soul to look in any guise Upon the teaching face of truth. Or shall no beauty fill the mind, No lesson—when the flocks stand fast, Their backs all set against the blast, Labouring immovable, combined, Till they with their weak feet have burst The frost-bound treasure of the stream, And now at length may quench their thirst? And O! how beautiful doth seem That evening journey when the herd Troop homeward by accustom'd ways, All night in paddock there to graze, And know the joy of rest deferr'd. Or if the crow, the sullen bird, Upon some leafless branch in view, Thrusts forth his neck, and flaps the bleak Dry wind, and grates his ravenous beak, That sight may feed thy musings too. And grand it is, 'mid forest boughs, In darkness, awfully forlorn, At night to hear the wind carouse, Within whose breath the strong trees quake Or stand with naked limbs all torn; While such unwonted clamours wake Around, that over all the plain Fear walks abroad, and tremble then The flocks, the herds, the husbandmen. But most sublime of all, most holy, The unfathomable melancholy When winds are silent in their cells; When underneath the moon's calm light, And in the unalter'd snow which veils All height and depth—to look thereon, It seems throughout the solemn night As if the earth and sky were one. SONNET TO THE LAUREL Approaching thee, thou growth of mystic spell, That wast of old a virgin fair and wise, I fix upon thee my devoted eyes And stand a little while immovable. Then if in the low breeze thy branches quail— “What, so afraid?” I say; “not I, poor tree, Apollo; though my heart hath cherish'd thee Because thou crown'st his children's foreheads well.” Then half-incensed, abasing mine own brow— “These leaves,” I muse, “how many crave—with these How few at length the flattering gods endow! I hoped—ah! shall I hope again? Nay, cease. Too much, alas! the world's rude clamours now Bewilder mine accorded cadences.” A DOCTOR'S ADVICE Translated from an inscription in ill-spelt French verse scratched on the pane of a window at the New Inn, Winchelsea. My doctor's issued his decree That too much wine is killing me, And furthermore his ban he hurls Against my touching naked girls. How then? must I no longer share Good wine or beauties dark and fair? Doctor, goodbye, my sail's unfurl'd, I'm off to try the other world. MY LADY My lady, as God made you, may God guard you: My lady, God uphold you, God exalt you; My lady, may God grant you all your wishes. LILITH FROM GÖTHE Hold thou thy heart against her shining hair, If, by thy fate, she spread it once for thee; For, when she nets a young man in that snare, So twines she him he never may be free. THE BALLAD OF DEAD LADIES FRANÇOIS VILLON, 1450 Tell me now in what hidden way is Lady Flora the lovely Roman? Where's Hipparchia, and where is Thais, Neither of them the fairer woman? Where is Echo, beheld of no man, Only heard on river and mere,— She whose beauty was more than human?... But where are the snows of yester-year? Where's Héloise, the learned nun, For whose sake Abeillard, I ween, Lost manhood and put priesthood on? (From Love he won such dule and teen!) And where, I pray you, is the Queen Who willed that Buridan should steer Sewed in a sack's mouth down the Seine?... But where are the snows of yester-year? White Queen Blanche, like a queen of lilies, With a voice like any mermaiden,— Bertha Broadfoot, Beatrice, Alice, And Ermengarde the lady of Maine,— And that good Joan whom Englishmen At Rouen doomed and burned her there,— Mother of God, where are they then?... But where are the snows of yester-year? Nay, never ask this week, fair lord, Where they are gone, nor yet this year, Save with thus much for an overword,— But where are the snows of yester-year? TO DEATH, OF HIS LADY FRANÇOIS VILLON Death, of thee do I make my moan, Who hadst my lady away from me, Nor wilt assuage thine enmity Till with her life thou hast mine own: For since that hour my strength has flown. Lo! what wrong was her life to thee, Death? Two we were, and the heart was one; Which now being dead, dead I must be, Or seem alive as lifelessly As in the choir the painted stone, Death! JOHN OF TOURS OLD FRENCH John of Tours is back with peace, But he comes home ill at ease. “Good-morrow, mother.” “Good-morrow, son; Your wife has borne you a little one.” “Go now, mother, go before, Make me a bed upon the floor; “Very low your foot must fall, That my wife hear not at all.” As it neared the midnight toll, John of Tours gave up his soul. “Tell me now, my mother my dear, What's the crying that I hear?” “Daughter, it's the children wake, Crying with their teeth that ache.” “Tell me though, my mother my dear, What's the knocking that I hear?” “Daughter, it's the carpenter Mending planks upon the stair.” “Tell me too, my mother my dear, What's the singing that I hear?” “Daughter, it's the priests in rows Going round about our house.” “Tell me then, my mother my dear, What's the dress that I should wear?” “Daughter, any reds or blues, But the black is most in use.” “Nay, but say, my mother my dear, Why do you fall weeping here?” “Oh! the truth must be said,— It's that John of Tours is dead.” “Mother, let the sexton know That the grave must be for two; “Aye, and still have room to spare, For you must shut the baby there.” MY FATHER'S CLOSE OLD FRENCH Inside my father's close, (Fly away O my heart away!) Sweet apple-blossom blows So sweet. Three kings' daughters fair, (Fly away O my heart away!) They lie below it there So sweet. “Ah!” says the eldest one, (Fly away O my heart away!) “I think the day's begun So sweet.” “Ah!” says the second one, (Fly away O my heart away!) “Far off I hear the drum So sweet.” “Ah!” says the youngest one, (Fly away O my heart away!) “It's my true love, my own, So sweet. “Oh! if he fight and win,” (Fly away O my heart away!) “I keep my love for him, So sweet: Oh! let him lose or win, He hath it still complete.” BEAUTY A COMBINATION FROM SAPPHO I Like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough, A-top on the top-most twig,—which the pluckers forgot somehow,— Forgot it not, nay, but got it not, for none could get it till now. II Like the wild hyacinth flower which on the hills is found, Which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound, Until the purple blossom is trodden into the ground. THE LEAF LEOPARDI “Torn from your parent bough, Poor leaf all withered now, Where go you?” “I cannot tell. Storm-stricken is the oak-tree Where I grew, whence I fell. Changeful continually, The zephyr and hurricane Since that day bid me flee From deepest woods to the lea, From highest hills to the plain. Where the wind carries me I go without fear or grief: I go whither each one goes,— Thither the leaf of the rose And thither the laurel-leaf.” HIS MOTHER'S SERVICE TO OUR LADY FRANÇOIS VILLON Lady of Heaven and Earth, and therewithal Crowned Empress of the nether clefts of Hell,— I, thy poor Christian, on thy name do call, Commending me to thee, with thee to dwell, Albeit in nought I be commendable. But all mine undeserving may not mar Such mercies as thy sovereign mercies are; Without the which (as true words testify) No soul can reach thy Heaven so fair and far. Even in this faith I choose to live and die. Unto thy Son say thou that I am His, And to me graceless make Him gracious. Sad Mary of Egypt lacked not of that bliss, Nor yet the sorrowful clerk Theophilus, Whose bitter sins were set aside even thus Though to the Fiend his bounden service was. Oh help me, lest in vain for me should pass (Sweet Virgin that shalt have no loss thereby!) The blessed Host and sacring of the Mass. Even in this faith I choose to live and die. A pitiful poor woman, shrunk and old, I am, and nothing learn'd in letter-lore. Within my parish-cloister I behold A painted Heaven where harps and lutes adore, And eke an Hell whose damned folk seethe full sore: One bringeth fear, the other joy to me. That joy, great Goddess, make thou mine to be,— Thou of whom all must ask it even as I; And that which faith desires, that let it see. For in this faith I choose to live and die. O excellent Virgin Princess! thou didst bear King Jesus, the most excellent comforter, Who even of this our weakness craved a share, And for our sake stooped to us from on high, Offering to death His young life sweet and fair. Such as He is, Our Lord, I Him declare, And in this faith I choose to live and die. FRANCESCA DA RIMINI DANTE When I made answer, I began: “Alas! How many sweet thoughts and how much desire Led these two onward to the dolorous pass!” Then turned to them, as who would fain inquire, And said: “Francesca, these thine agonies Wring tears for pity and grief that they inspire: But tell me,—in the season of sweet sighs, When and what way did Love instruct you so That he in your vague longings made you wise?” Then she to me: “There is no greater woe Than the remembrance brings of happy days In misery; and this thy guide doth know. But if the first beginnings to retrace Of our sad love can yield thee solace here, So will I be as one that weeps and says. One day we read, for pastime and sweet cheer, Of Lancelot, how he found Love tyrannous: We were alone and without any fear. Our eyes were drawn together, reading thus, Full oft, and still our cheeks would pale and glow; But one sole point it was that conquered us. For when we read of that great lover, how He kissed the smile which he had longed to win,— Then he whom nought can sever from me now For ever, kissed my mouth, all quivering. A Galahalt was the book, and he that writ: Upon that day we read no more therein.” At the tale told, while one soul uttered it, The other wept: a pang so pitiable That I was seized, like death, in swooning-fit, And even as a dead body falls, I fell. LA PIA DANTE “Ah when on earth thy voice again is heard, And thou from the long road hast rested thee,” After the second spirit said the third, “Remember me who am La Pia. Me Siena, me Maremma, made, unmade. He knoweth this thing in his heart—even he With whose fair jewel I was ringed and wed.”</field>
