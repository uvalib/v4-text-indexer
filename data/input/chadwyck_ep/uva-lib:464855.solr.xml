      <field name="fulltext">Iter Boreale. Attempting somthing upon the Successful and Matchless March of the LORD GENERAL George Monck, From SCOTLAND to LONDON, in the Winter, 1659. I. The day is broke! Melpomene, be gone; Hag of my Fancy, let me now alone: Night-mare my Soul no more; Go take thy flight Where Traitors Ghosts keep an eternal night; Flee to Mount Caucasus, and bear thy part With the black fowl that tears Prometheus heart For his bold Sacriledg: Go fetch the groans Of defunct Tyrants, with them croke thy Tones; Go see Alecto with her flaming whip, How she sinks Nol, and makes old Bradshaw skip: Go make thy self away,—Thou shalt no more Choak up my Standish with the blood and gore Of English Tragedies: I now will chuse The merriest of the nine to be my Muse: And come what will, I'le scribble once again: The brutish Sword hath cut the nobler Vein Of racy Poetry. Our small-drink-times Must be contented, and take up with Rhimes. They'r sorry toyes from a poor Levites pack, Whose Living and Assesments drink no Sack. The Subject will excuse the Verse (I trow) The Ven'son's fat, although the crust be dough. II. I he who whileom sate and sung in Cage My Kings and Countries Ruines by the rage Of a rebellious Rout; who weeping saw Three goodly Kingdoms (drunk with fury) draw And sheath their Swords (like three enraged brothers) In one anothers sides, ripping their Mothers Belly, and tearing out her bleeding heart; Then jealous that their Father fain would part Their bloody fray, and let them fight no more, Fell foul on Him, and slew Him at His dore. I that have only dar'd to whisper Verses, And drop a tear (by stealth) on loyal Hearses; I that enraged at the Times and Rump, Had gnaw'd my Goose-quill to the very stump, And flung that in the Fire, no more to write, But to sit down poor Britains Heraclite, Now sing the triumphs of the Men of War, The Glorious Rayes of the bright Northern Star, Created for the nonce by Heaven to bring The wise men of three Nations to their King: MONCK! the great Monck! that syllable outshines Plantagenet's bright Name, or Constantine's. 'Twas at His Rising that Our Day begun, Be he the Morning Star to CHARLES our Sun. He took Rebellion rampant, by the throat, And made the Canting Quaker change his Note; His hand it was that wrote, (we saw no more) Exit Tyrannus over Lamberts dore. Like to some subtle Lightning, so His Words Dissolved in their Scabbards Rebels Swords. He with success the Soveraign skill hath found To dress the Weapon, and to heal the Wound. George, and his Boyes (as Spirits do, they say) Only by walking, scare our Foes away. III. Old Holofernes was no sooner laid, Before the Idols Funeral Pomp was paid, (Nor shall a penny ere be paid for me; Let fools that trusted his true Mourners be.) Richard the Fourth, just peeping out of Squire, No fault so much, as th' old one was his Sire; For men believ'd,—though all went in his Name, Hee'd be but Tenant till the Landlord came: When on a sudden (all amaz'd) we found The seven years Babel tumbled to the ground; And he, poor heart, (thanks to his cunning Kin) Was soon in Querpo honest Dick agen. Exit Protector.—What comes next? I trow, Let the State-Huntsmen beat again.—So-ho, Cries Lambert, Master of the Hounds,—Here sits That lusty Puss, The Good Old Cause,—whose wits Shew'd Oliver such sport; That, that (cries Vane) Lets put her up, and run her once again: She'l lead our Dogs and Followers up and down, Whilst we match Families, and take the Crown. Enter th' old Members: 'Twas the Month of May These Maggots in the Rump began to play: Wallingford Anglers (though they stunk) yet thought They would make baits, by which Fish might be caught; And so it prov'd, they soon by taxes made More money than the Holland Fishing Trade. IV. Now broke in Egypts Plagues (all in a day) And one more worse than theirs,—We must not pray To be deliver'd:—Their scab'd folks were free To scratch where it did itch;—So might not we. That Meteor Cromwel, though he scar'd, gave light; But we were now cover'd with horrid night: Our Magistracy was (like Moses Rod) Turn'd to a Serpent by the angry God. Poor Citizens, when Trading would not do, Made brick without straw, and were blasted too: Struck with the botch of Taxes and Excise; Servants (our very dust) were turn'd to Lice; It was but turning Souldiers, and they need Not work at all, but on their Masters feed. Strange Catterpillars are our pleasant things; And Frogs croakt in the Chambers of our Kings: Black bloody veins did in the Rump prevail, Like the Philistims Emrods in the Tayle. Lightning, Hail, Fire, and Thunder Egypt had, And England Guns, Shot, Powder, (thats as bad.) And that Sea-Monster Lawson (if withstood) Threatned to turn our Rivers into Blood. And (Plague of all these Plagues) all these Plagues fell Not on an Egypt, but our Israel. V. Sick (as her heart can hold) the Nation lies, Filling each corner with her hideous cries: Somtimes Rage (like a burning Fever) heats, Anon Despair brings cold and clammy Sweats; She cannot sleep; or if she doth she dreams Of Rapes, Thefts, Burnings, Blood, and direful theams; Tosses from side to side, then by and by Her feet are laid there where the head did lie: None can come to her but bold Empericks, Who never meant to cure her but try tricks: Those very Doctors who should give her ease, (God help the Patient) was her worst disease. Th' Italian Mountebank Vane tells her sure Jesuits Powder will effect the Cure. If grief but makes her swell, Martin and Nevil Conclude it is a spice of the Kings-Evil. Bleed her again, another cries;—And Scot Saith he could cure her, if 'twas—you know what: But giddy Harrington a whimsey found, To make her head (like to his brains) run round: Her old and wise Physitians, who before Had well nigh cur'd her, came again to th' dore, But were kept out, which made her cry the more, Help, help, (dear Children) Oh! some pity take On her who bore you! help for mercy sake! Oh heart! Oh head! Oh back! Oh bones! I feel They've poyson'd me with giving too much steel: Oh give me that for which I long and cry! Somthing that's Soveraign, or else I dye. VI. Kind Cheshire heard;—And like some son that stood Upon the Bank, straight jump'd into the flood, Flings out his arms, &amp; strikes som strokes to swim Booth ventur'd first, and Middleton with him; Stout Mackworth, Egerton, and thousands more, Threw themselves in, and left the safer shore; Massey (that famous Diver) and bold Brown Forsook his Wharf,—resolving all to drown, Or save a sinking Kingdom:—But, O sad! Fearing to lose her prey, the Sea grew mad, Rais'd all her billows, and resolv'd her waves, Should quickly be the bold Adventurers graves. Out Marches Lambert, like an Eastern Wind, And with him all the mighty waters joyn'd. The Loyal Swimmers bore up heads and breasts, Scorning to think of Life or Interests; They ply'd their Arms and Thighs, but all in vain; The furious Main beat them to shore again; At which the floating Island (looking back, Spying her loyal Lovers gone to wrack) Shriekt lowder then before,—and thus she cries, “Can you be angry heavens, and frowning skies, “Thus countenance rebellious Mutineers, “Who, if they durst, would be about your ears? “That I should sink, with Justice may accord, “Who let my Pilot be thrown over-board; “Yet 'twas not I (ye righteous Heavens do know) “The Soldiers in me needs would have it so: “And those who conjur'd up these storms themselves, “And first engag'd me 'mongst these Rocks and Shelves “Guilty of all my wo, have rais'd this weather, “Fearing to come to Land, and chusing rather “To sink me with themselves,—O cease to frown “In tears (just Heavens!) behold! my self I drown: “Let not these proud waves do't: Prevent my fears, “And let them fall together by the ears. VII. Heav'n heard, and struck th' insulting army mad Drunk with their Cheshire Triumphs, straight they had New-Lights appear'd, and new Resolves they take, A Single Person once again to make. Who shall be he? Oh! Lambert, without rub, The fittest Devil to be Belzebub. He, the fierce Fiend, cast out o'th' House before, Return'd, and threw the House now out of door: A Legion then he rais'd of Armed Sprights, Elves, Goblins, Faires, Quakers, and new Lights, To be his under Devils, with this rest He Soul and Body (Church and State) possest: Who tho they fil'd all countries, towns, and rooms Yet (like that Fiend that did frequent the Tombs) Churches, and Sacred Grounds they haunted most, No Chappel was at ease from some such Ghost. The Priests ordain'd to exercise those Elves, Were voted Devils, and cast out themselves: Bible, or Alchoran, all's one to them, Religion serves but for a stratagem: The holy Charms these Adders did not heed, Churches themselves did Sanctuary need. VIII. The Churches Patrimony and rich Store, Alas! was swallow'd many years before: Bishops and Deans we fed upon before, They were the Ribs and Surloyns of the Whore: Now let her Legs (the Priests go to the Pot, (They have the Pope's eye in them) spare them not: We have fat Benefices yet to eat, (Bell, and our Dragon-Army must have meat:) Let us devour her Limb-meal, great and small, Tythe Calves, Geese, Pigs, the Petitoes and all: A Vicaridg in Sippets, though it be But small, will serve a squeamish Sectary. Though Universities we can't endure, There's no false Latine in their Lands (be sure.) Give Oxford to our Horse, and let the Foot Take Cambridge for their booty, and fall too't. Christ-Church ile have (cries Vane;) Disbrow swops At Trinity; Kings is for Berry's chops; Kelsey, take Corpus Christi; All-Souls, Packer; Grave Creed, St. Johns; New Colledg leave to Hacker; Fleetwood cries, Weeping Maudlin shall be mine, Her tears Ile drink instead of Muscadine: The smaller Halls and Houses scarce are big Enough to make one dish for Hasilrig; We must be sure to stop his mouth, though wide, Else all our fat will be i'th fire (they cry'd: And when we have done these, we'l not be quiet, Lordships and Landlords Rents shall be our diet. Thus talk'd this jolly crew, but still mine Host Lambert resolves that he will rule the Rost. IX. But hark! Methinks I hear old Boreas blow; What mean the north-winds that they bluster so? More storms from that black nook? Forbear (bold Scot!) Let not Dunbar and Worc'ster be forgot: What? would you chaffer w'us for one Charls more The price of Kings is fal'n, give the Trade o're. And is the price of Kings and Kingdoms too, Of Laws, lives, oaths, souls, grown so low with you? Perfidious Hypocrites! Monsters of Men! (Cries the good Monck) we'l raise their price agen Heaven said Amen, and breath'd upon that Spark; That Spark (preserv'd alive i'th cold and dark) First kindled and enflam'd the British Isle, And turn'd it all to Bonefires in a while: He and his fewel was so small, no doubt, Proud Lambert thought to tread or piss them out. But George was wary;—His cause did require A Pillar of a Cloud as well as Fire: 'Twas not his safest course to flame, but smoak; His enemies he will not burn but choak; Small Fires must not blaze out, left by their light They shew their weakness, and their foes invite; But Furnaces the stoutest Metals melt, (And so did he) by fire not seen, but felt; Dark-lanthorn Language, and his peep-bo-play, Will-E-Wispt Lambert's new Lights out o'th way. George &amp; his boys, those thousands (ô strang thing) Of Snipes and Woodcocks took by Lowbelling. His few Scotch-Coal kindled with English Fire Made Lamberts great Newcastle heaps expire. X. Scotland (though poor and peevish) was content To keep the Peace, and (O rare!) money lent; But yet the blessing of their Kirk was more; George had that too, and with this slender store He and his Mirmidons advance:—Kind Heaven Prepar'd a Frost to make their March more eaven Easy and safe; it may be said, That year Of th' High-ways Heaven it self was Overseer, And made November ground as hard as May; White as their Innocence, so was their Way: The Clouds came down in Feather-beds, to greet Him and his Army, and to kiss their feet. The frost and foes both came and went together, Both thaw'd away, &amp; vanish'd God knows whither. Whole Countries crowded in to see this friend, Ready to cast their bodies down to mend His Road to Westminster; and still they shout, Lay hold of th' Rump, and pull the Monster out: A new one, or a whole one (Good my Lord) And to this cry the Island did accord, The Eccho of the Irish hollow ground Heard England, and her language did rebound. XI. Presto-Jack Lambert, and his Sprights are gone To dance a Jig with's brother Oberon: George made him, and his Cut-throats of our lives, Swallow their swords as Juglers do their Knives. And Carter Disborough to wish in vain, He now were Waggoner to Charls his Wain. The Conqueror is now come into th' South, Whose warm Air is made hot by every mouth; Breathing his welcome, and in spite of Scot, Crying—The whole Child (Sir) divide it not: The Rump begins to stink; Alas! (cry they) W'have rais'd a Devil which we cannot lay. I like him not—His Belly is so big, There's a King in't, cryes furious Hasilrig, Let's bribe Him (they cry all) Carve him a share Of our stoln Venison.—Varlets forbear, In vain you put your Lime twigs to his Hands George Monck is for the King, not for his Lands, When fair means would not do, next foul they try, Vote him the City Scavenger, (they cry) Send him to scowr their Streets.—Well, let it be; Your Rumpship wants a scowring too, (thinks he) That foul house where your Worships many year Have laid your Tail, sure wants a Scavenger: I smell your Fizzle, though it make no Crack, You'ld mount me on the Cities galled Back, In hope she'll cast her Rider: If I must Upon some Office in the Town be thrust, I'le be their Sword-bearer,—and to their Dagger I'le joyn my Sword:—Nay, (good Rump) do not swagger, The City feasts me, and as sure as Gun) I'le mend all Englands Commons e're I've done. XII. And so he did: One morning next his heart He goes to Westminster, and play'd his part; He vampt their boots (which Hewson ne'r could do) With better leather, made them g'upright too. The Restor'd Members (Cato-like, no doubt) Did only enter that They might go out; They did not mean within those Walls to dwell, Nor did they like their Company so well: Yet Heav'n so blest them, that in three weeks space They gave both Church and State a better face; They gave Booth, Massy, Brown, some kinder lots; The last years Traytors, this years Patriots: The Churches poor Remainder they made good, And wash'd the Nations Hands of Royal Blood; And that a Parliament (they did devise) From its own ashes (Phænix-like) might rise; This done, By Act and Deed that might not fail, They past a Fine, and so cut off th' Entail. XIII. Let the Bells ring these Changes now from Bow Down to the Country Candlesticks below; Ringers, hands off; The Bells themselves will dance In memory of their own deliverance. Had not George shew'd his Metal, and said Nay, Each Sectary had born the Bell away: Down with them all, they'r Christned (cry'd that Crew) Tye up their Clappers, and the Parsons too; Turn them to Guns, or sell them to the Dutch. Nay, hold, (quoth George) my Masters, that's too much You will not leap o're Steeples thus, I hope I'le save the Bells, but you may take the Rope. Thus lay Religion panting for her life, Like Isaac, bound under the bloody knife; George held the falling Weapon, sav'd the Lamb: Let Lamberts (in the Briars) be the Ram. So lay the Royal Virgin (as 'tis told) When brave S. George redeem'd her life, of old. Oh that the Knaves that have consum'd our Land, Had but permitted Wood enough to stand To be his Bonfires;—Wee'd burn every stem, And leave no more but Gallow-trees for them. XIV. March on, Great Heroe! as thou hast begun, And crown our Happiness before th' ast done We have another CHARLES to fetch from Spain, Be thou the GEORGE to bring him back again: Then shalt thou be (what was deny'd that Knight) Thy Princes, and the Peoples Favorite. There is no danger of the Winds at all, Unless together by the Ears they fall, Who shall the honour have to waft a King: And they who gain it, while they work shall sing. Methinks I see how those Triumphant Gales, Proud of the great Enployment, swell the Sails: The joyful Ship shall dance, the Sea shall laugh, And loyal Fish their Masters health shall quaff: See how the Dolphins croud and thrust their large And scaly shoulders, to assist the Barge; The peaceful Kingfishers are met together About the Decks and prophesie calm weather; Poor Crabs and Lobsters are gone down to creep, And search for Pearls and Jewels in the deep; And when they have the booty,—crawl before, And leave them for his welcome to the Shore. XV. Me-thinks I see how throngs of people stand Scarce patient till the Vessel come to Land, Ready to leap in, and if need require, With Tears of Joy, to make the waters higher. But what will London do? I doubt Old Paul With bowing to his Soveraign will fall, The Royal Lyons from the Tower shall roar, And though they see him not, yet shall adore: The Conduits will be ravish'd, and combine To turn their very water into Wine: And for the Citizens, I only pray They may not over-joy'd all die that day: May we all live more loyal and more true, To give to Cæsar and to God their due. Wee'l make his Fathers Tomb with tears to swim And for the Son we'll shed our blood for him. England her penitential Song shall sing, And take heed how she quarrels with her King. If for our sins—our Prince shall be misled, Wee'l bite our nails, rather than scratch our head. XVI. One English George out-weighs alone (by odds) A whole Committee of the Heathens Gods; Pronounce but Monck, and (it is all his due) He is our Mercury, Mars, and Neptune too. Monck (what great Xerxes could not) prov'd the man That with a word shackled the Ocean; He shall command Neptune himself to bring His Trident, and present it to our King. Oh do it then, great Admiral:—Away, Let him be here against St. George's day; That Charls may wear His Dieu Et Mon Droit, And Thou the Noble Garter'd Honi Soit. And when thy Aged Corps shall yield to Fate, God save that soul that sav'd our Church and State: There thou shalt have a glorious Crown, I know, Who Crown'dst our King and Kingdoms here below. But who shall find a Pen fit for thy glory; Or make Posterity believe thy Story? Vive St. GEORGE, THE TRAGEDY OF Mr. Christopher Love, Late Minister of the Gospel; Acted upon TOWER-HILL, August 22. 1651. The Prologue. New from a slaughter'd Monarchs Hearse I come, A Mourner to a Martyr'd Prophet's Tomb: Pardon, great Charls his Ghost my Muse had stood Yet three years longer, till sh' had wept a Flood; Too mean a Sacrifice for Royal Blood. But she must go, Heav'n does by Thunder call For her Attendance at LOVE's Funeral: Forgive, great Sir, this Sacriledge in me, The tenth Tear he must have, it is his Fee; 'Tis due to him, and yet 'tis stoln from Thee. The Argument. 'Twas when the Raging Dog did rule the Skies, And with his scorching Face did tyrannize, When cruel Cromwel, Whelp of that mad Star, But sure more fiery than his Sire by far, Had dry'd the Northern Fife, and with his heat Put frozen Scotland in a Bloody Sweat: When he had conquer'd, and his furious Train Had chas'd the North-Bear, &amp; pursu'd Charls Wain Into the English Orb; then 'twas thy fate (Sweet LOVE) to be a Present from our State. A greater Sacrifice there could not come, Than a Divine, to bleed his Welcome home. For He, and Herod think no Dish so good, As a John Baptists Head, serv'd up in Blood. ACT. I. The Philistims are set in their High Court, And Love, like Samson's fetch'd to make them sport: Unto the Stake the smiling Prisoner's brought: Not to be try'd, but baited, most men thought: Monsters, like Men, must worry him; and thus He fights with Beasts, like Paul at Ephesus. Adams, Far, Huntington, with all the Pack Of foisting Hounds, were set upon his Back. Prideaux and Keeble stand and cry, Haloo; 'Twas a full Cry, and yet it would not do. Oh how he foil'd them! Standers by did swear, That he the Judge, and they the Traitors were: For there he prov'd (although he seem'd a Lamb) Stout, like a Lion, from whose Den he came. ACT. II. It is decreed; nor shall thy Worth, dear Love, Resist their Vows, nor their Revenge remove. Though Pray'rs were join'd to Pray'rs, &amp; tears to tears, No Softness in their Rocky Hearts appears: Nor Heav'n nor Earth abate their Fury can, But they will have thy Head, thy Head, good Man. Sure some She-Sectary longed, and in haste Must try how Presbyterian Blood did taste. 'Tis fit she have the best, and therefore thine, Thine must be broach'd, blest Saint! 'tis Drink divine, No sooner was the dreadful Sentence read, The Prisoner straight bow'd his condemned Head: And by that humble Posture told them all, It was a Head that did not fear a fall. ACT. III. And now I wish the fatal Stroke were given; I'm sure our Martyr longs to be in Heaven, And Heav'n to have him there: one moments blow Makes him triumphant; but here comes his wo, His Enemies will grant a Months Suspence, If't be for the nonce to keep him thence:) And that he may tread in his Saviours ways, He shall be tempted too, his forty days: And with such baits too, Cast thy self but down, Fall, and but worship, and your Life's your own. Thus cry'd his Enemies; oh 'twas their pride, To wound his Body, and his Soul beside. One Plot th' have more, when all their own do fail If Devils can't, Disciples may prevail. Lets tempt him by his Friends, make Peter cry, Good Master, Spare thy self, and do not die. One Friend entreats, a second weeps, a third Cries, Your Petition wants the other word: I'l write it for you, saith a fourth; Your Life, Your Life, Sir, cries a fifth, Pity your Wife, And the Babe in her: Thus this Diamonds cut By Diamonds only, and to terror put. Methinks I hear him still, You wound my heart; Good Friends, forbear; for every word's a Dart: 'Tis cruel pity, thus I do profess, You'ld love me more, if you did love me less: Friends, Children, Wife, Life, all are dear, I know But all's too dear, if I should buy them so. Thus, like a rock that routs the waves, he stands, And snaps asunder, Sampson-like, these bands. ACT. IV. The Day is come, the Prisoner longs to go, And chides the ling'ring Sun for tarrying so: Which blushing seems to answer from the Sky, That it was loth to see a Martyr dye. Methinks I heard beheaded Saints above Call to each other, Sirs, Make room for LOVE. Who when he came to tread the fatal Stage, (Which prov'd his Glory, and his Enemies rage) His Blood ne'r run t'his heart, Christs Blood was there Reviving it, his own was all to spare: Which rising in his Cheeks, did seem to say, Is this the Bloud you thirst for? Tak't, I pray. Spectators in his Looks such Life did see, That they appear'd more like to die than he. But oh his Speech! methinks I hear it still; It ravish'd Friends, and did his Enemies kill: His keener Words did their sharp Ax exceed; That made his head, but he their hearts, to bleed: Which he concluded with soft Prayer, and so The Lamb lay down, and took the Butchers blow: His Soul makes Heav'n shine brighter by a Star, And now we're sure there's one Saint Christopher. ACT. V. LOVE lies a bleeding, and the World shall see Heav'n act a part in this black Tragedy. The Sun no sooner spy'd the Head o'th' floor, But he pull'd in his own, and look'd no more. The Clouds, which scattered, and in colours were, Met altogether, and in black appear: Light'nings, which fill'd the Air with blazing light, Did serve for Torches at that dismal Night: In which, and all next day, for many hours, Heav'n groan'd in Thunder, &amp; did weep in Showrs. Nor do I wonder, that God thundered so, When's Boanerges murdred lay below: The High Court trembled, Prideaux, Bradshaw, Keeble, And all the guilty Rout, look'd pale and feeble. Timerous Jenkins, and cold-hearted Drake, Hold out, you need no base Petitions make: Your Enemies thus Thunder-struck, no doubt, Will be beholding to you to go out. But if you will recant, now thundring Heaven Such Approbation to Love's cause hath given, I'le add but this; Your Consciences perhaps, Ere long, shall feel far greater Thunder-claps. The Epilogue. But stay, my Muse grows fearful too, and must Beg that these Lines be buried with thy Dust: Shelter, bless'd Love, this verse within thy Shroud, For none but Heav'n dares take thy part aloud. The Author begs this, lest, if it be known. Whilst he bewails thy Head, he lose his own. R. W. UPON The much to be Lamented DEATH OF THE Reverend Mr. Vines. Art thou gone too (thou great &amp; gallant mind) And must such Sneaks as I be left behind? If thus our Horsemen and Commanders die, What can the Infantry do then but fly? Oh Divine Vines! tell us, why wouldst thou go, Unless thou couldst have left thy Parts below? If there's a Metempsuchosis indeed, Tell us where we may find thee at our need? Who hath thy Memory? thy Brain, thy Heart? Whom didst thou leave thy Tongue? (for ev'ry part Of thee can make a Man.) What if we find (As I'l not swear this Age won't change her mind) Prelacy (though her Lands are sold) revive? Or Independency (who hopes to thrive, No where suits Trump) should dare dispute at length? Where hast thou left thy Presbyterian Strength, With which thou got'st the Game in th' Isle of Wight, Where the King cry'd that Vines was in the right? When Essex dy'd (the Honour of our Nation) Thou gav'st him a new life in thy Oration. But when great Fairfax to his Fate shall yield, Whom hast thou left—to fetch from Naseby-field Th' Immortal Turf, and dress it with a Story, That shall perpetuate his name and glory? Where's thy rich Fancy (man?) To whom (beneath) Didst thou thy lofty and high strain bequeath? Tell us for thy own sake; for none but he That hath thy Wit, can write thy Elegie. Till he be found, let this suffice, which I Leave on thy Stone:—Here lies the Ministry. R. W. TO THE MEMORY OF Mr. Jeremy Whitaker, Powerful in Prayer and Preaching, Pious in Life, Patient in Sickness, &amp;c. Nay, now forbear; for pity sake give o're, You that would make the Clergy none, or poor: We are made miserable enough this year, That we have lost our Reverend Whitaker; Loss above Deans and Chapters! had but he Liv'd still and preach'd: Ziba take all (for me.) Nay I believe had sacrilegious hands Finger'd our poor remains of Tithes and Lands, Whil'st he surviv'd they had but pray'd in vain, Whitaker would have pray'd them back again, As Luther did a young mans Soul repeal, Giv'n to the Devil under Hand and Seal, A Chariot and an Horseman we have lost, In whose each single Pray'r incamp'd an Host. How have I heard him on some solemn Day, When doubtful War could make all London pray) Mount up to Heav'n with armed cries and tears, And rout, as far as York, the Cavaliers! Have you not seen an early-rising Lark Spring from her Turf, making the Sun her mark, Shooting her self aloft, yet higher, higher, Till she had sung her self into Heaven's Quire? Thus would he rise in Pray'r, and in a trice His Soul become a Bird of Paradise: And if our faint Devotions Prayers be, What can we call his less than Extasie? On his Preaching. If with the Almighty he prevailed so, Wonder not that he Wonders wrought below: The Son of Consolation and of Thunder Met both in him, in others are asunder. He was (like Luke) Physitian of both kinds, Wrought Cures upon Mens Bodies &amp; their Minds, The Falling-sickness of Apostacy, Dropsie of Drunkenness, Prides Tympany, The Meagrim of Opinions, new or old, Palsie of Unbelief, Charities cold, Lusts burning Fever, Angers Calenture, The Collick in the Conscience he could cure: Set the souls broken bones; by holy Art He hath dissolv'd the Stone in many a Heart, Harder than that he dy'd of—O come in, Ye multitudes whom he hath heal'd of sin, And thereby made his Debtors—Pay him now Some of those tears which he laid out for you; Interest-tears, I mean; for should you all Weep over him both Use and Principal, 'Twould wash away the Stone (which covers him) And make his Coffin (like an Ark) to swim. Now wipe thine eyes (my Muse) &amp; stop thy Verse (Thy Ink can only serve to black his Hearse,) Yet (stay) i'll drop one Tear, sigh one sigh more, 'Tis this, although my Poetry be poor O what a mighty Prophet should I be, Had this Elijah's Mantle faln to me! Oh might I live his Life! I'd be content His sore Diseases too should me torment: And if his Patience could mine become, I would not be afraid of Martyrdom. R. W. UPON THE DEATH OF So many Reverend Ministers of late. Still we do find, Black cloth wears out the first; And fruits that are the choicest keep the worst. Such men? So many? and they die so fast? They'r precious (death) oh do not make such waste. Scarce have we dry'd our eyes for loss of one, But in comes tidings that another's gone. Oh that I had my former Tears agen, (All but those few laid out upon my sin,) Had I an Helicon in either Eye, I have occasion now to verse them dry. Triumph (licentious Age) lift up thy Song, Presbytery sha'nt trouble you ere long; Those that tormented you before your day, Are now apace removing out o'th' way. Yea, rather tremble (England) stand agast, To see thy glorious Lamps go out so fast; When Death (like Sampson) thus lays hold upon The Pillars of the Church,—The Building's gone. When we do see so many Stars to fall, Surely, it boads the World's great Funeral. London, look too't, and think what Heav'n is doing Thy Flames are coming when thy Lots are going, Well may we all fear God intendeth-Wars, When he commands home his Embassadors. That Venerable Synod, which of late Was made the Object of Mens Scorn and Hate, (For want of Copes and Mitres, not of Graces) Are now call'd up (with Moses) and their Faces When they return, shall shine; God sees it fit, Such an Assembly should in Glory sit. The learned Twisse went first, (it was his right) Then holy Palmer, Borroughs, Love, Gouge, White, Hill, Whitaker, grave Gataker, and Strong, Pern, Marshal, Robinson, all gone along. I have not nam'd them half: their only strife Hath been (of late) who should first part with Life. Those few who yet survive, sick of this Age, Long to have done their parts, and leave the Stage. Our English Luther, Vines, (whose Death I weep) Stole away (and said nothing) in a Sleep: Sweet (like a Swan) he preach'd that day he went, And for his Cordial took a Sacrament: Had it but been suspected—he would die, His People sure had stop'd him with their Cry. My blear-ey'd Muse ('tis tears have made her so) Must wash his Marble too, before she go. AN ELOGY UPON THE Earl of Essex HIS FUNERAL. And are there all the Rites that must be done Thrice Noble ESSEX, Englands Champion? Some Men, some Walls, some Horses put in black With the Throng scrambling for Sweet-meats and Sack; A gawdy Herald, and a Velvet Hearse, A tattar'd Anagram with grievous Verse, And a sad Sermon to conclude withall, Shall this be stil'd great ESSEX's Funeral? Niggardly Nation, be asham'd of th' odds, Less Valour among Heathen made men gods: Should such a General have dy'd in Rome, He must have had an Altar, not a Tomb; And there, in stead of youthful Elegies, Grave Senators had offer'd Sacrifice To Divine Devereux: O for a Vote, (Ye Lords and Commons, ye are bound to do't) A Vote, that who is seen to smile this year, A Vote, that who so brings not in a Tear, Shall be adjudg'd Malignant: It were wise T'erect an Office in the Peoples eyes, For issuing forth a constant sum of Tears, There's no way else to pay him his Arrears: And when w'have drein'd this Ages eyes quite dry, Let him be wept the next in History; Which if Posterity shall dare to doubt, Then Glosters whisp'ring Walls shall speak him out: And so his Funeral shall not be done, Till he return i'th' Resurrection. To the Father of a very vertuous Virgin, Deceased; who desired an obscure Person to make an Elegy, &amp;c. Sir, Be advis'd; She's not your Daughter now, But a crown'd Saint in Heav'ns great Court, &amp; you Must take heed what you offer to her Shrine; You'l be profane, if that be not Divine. Sternhold (who kill'd the Psalms, and David too In Meeter and good meaning) did not do More violence to Heav'n, than you to her, If, whil'st you think't a kindness, you shall blur Her Honour with my Ink: 'tis a disgrace To set black Spots upon a glorious Face. Disdain will burst her Coffin (sure) to have Such dirty Feet as mine stand on her Grave. Besides, 'tis niggardly to weep in Verse, Tears without measure best become her Hearse, The talking Book is shallow, still we see Great Sorrows, like deep Rivers, silent be. Were I Apollo's Priest indeed, and fit To send a Poem up in flames of Wit, Yet i'm but one; Sir, to her Altar's due Whole Hecatombs of Verse, and Poets too. Go search St. Pauls-Church-yard, imploy choice eyes To scan all Epitaphs and Elegies; All the rich Fancies, sacred Raptures, all The Pearly drops which ever yet did fall On spotless Virgins Tombs: then make your claim Print and devote them to your Daughters name. Those vast Hyperboles, those lofty Notes, Which crackt the Muses Voices, rent their throats Offended scrup'lous Readers, made them think Poetry only strong Lines, and strong Drink, Allayed by her merit, soon will be Reduc'd to sober Truth, and Modesty, But stay, this counsel is but simple stuff, (Englands Divine) Reynolds hath done enough: His Sermon is her Monument in print, And hath more Honour than all Poems in't. That doth not only speak her Saint, and more, Can make him one too, who but reads it o're. Reynolds records her Saint, and you may hope That's more than canonizing by a Pope. IN MEMORY Of M??? E. T. Who dyed April 7. 1659. It was the Spring, and Flowers were in contest, Whose smels should first reach Heav'n, and please it best; Then did Eliza's sweetness so surpass All Rival Virgins, that she sent for was. 'Twas April when she dy'd; no Month so fit For Heav'n to be a mourner in, as it. 'Twas Easter too; that time did Death devise Best for this Lamb to be a Sacrifice. It was the Spring; The way 'twixt Heav'n &amp; Earth Was sweetned for her passage, by the Birth Of early Flowers, which burst their Mothers womb, Resolv'd to live and die upon her Tomb. It was the Spring; Between the Earth and Sky, To please her Soul as it was passing by, Birds fill'd the Air with Anthems, every nest Was on the Wing, to chaunt her to her Rest: Not a Pen-feathered Lark, who ne'r try'd Wing, Nor Throat; but ventur'd then to fly, and sing: Following the Saint towards Heav'n, whose entrance there Dampt them, and chang'd their Notes. Then pensive Air Dissolv'd to tears, which spoil'd the feather'd Train And sunk them to their nests with grief again. Mean time, me thought, I saw at Heav'ns fair Gate The glorious Vigins meet, and kiss their Mate. They stood a while her Beauty to admire Then led her to her place in their own Quire: Which seem'd to be defective, untill she Added her Sweetness to their Harmony. As Meddals scatter'd when some Prince goes by, So lay the Stars that night about the Sky. The Milky Way too, (since she past it o're) Methinks looks whiter than it was before. AN EPITAPH Upon E. T. Reader, didst thou but know what sacred Dust Thou tread'st upon, thou'dst judg thy self unjust Shouldst thou neglect a showr of tears to pay, To wash the Sin of thy own Feet away. That Actor in the Play, who looking down When he should cry, O Heav'n,—was thought a Clown, And guilty of a Solœcism—might have Applause for such an Action o're this Grave. Here lies a piece of Heav'n, and Heav'n one day Will send the best in Heav'n to fetch't away. Truth is, this Lovely Virgin from her Birth Became a constant strife 'twixt Heav'n and Earth: Both claim'd her, pleaded for her; either cry'd, The Child is mine; at length they did divide: Heav'n took her Soul; The Earth her Corps did seize, Yet not in Fee, she only holds by Lease; With this Proviso—when the Judge shall call, Earth shall give up her share, and Heav'n have all UPON The Learned Works of the Reverend DIVINE Ed. Reynolds, D. D. Reader, who e're thou art, here thou maist find Within these Works, a rare, rich, glorious mind Of Golden Precepts, which, alike, do shew What's thy D stemper how to cure it too: Do pains oppress thy Body? Sorrow Mind? Draw near to God, Pray'r will acceptance find; And then no doubt, he'll grant, thy Bodies Grief May bring thy sinking soul some small Relief. Do Passions over-top thy will? beware, Virtue consists not in so high a Sphere: If thou the Golden Medium wilt find, Shun thou too high, and too too low a mind. Pleasures are gilded Nothings, which like bubbles fly, Swoln big with Emptiness so burst and die. Do darkest times of ignorance draw near? The rather view these weighty Lines: nor fear, Nor wonder much at this resplendent Light: Diamonds shine brightest in the darkest night. The Merchant-man sold all he had, to buy The rich, rare, Gospel Jewel: O then why Art thou so backward, since that thou mayst make This Gem thine own, yea, at a cheaper rate? The foolish Virgins, when their Lord of Light Past by, their lights were out: So that eternal night Was their reward, and just, for they that deem Pains cost of greater worth, shall ne'r be seen Within his Courts, who is great, good, and just. Is Folly thus repaid? Reader, we must Look that it ne'r be said of thee or I, That our Neglect should cause our light to die. R. W. Another. Look wishly (friend) thou seldom seest such men Heav'n drops such Jewels down but now and then, One in an Age, or Nation: oh 'tis rare, Two Reynoldses should fall to Englands share! Could Rome but shew one such, and this were He, His Picture could not scape Idolatry: Whom Papists (not with Superstitious Fire) Would dare t' adore, we justly may admire. R. W. Aliud. Learning, whose Forces did dispersed lie (Of late alarm'd by the Enemy) Calling a Councel, did resolve at length, To chuse one General over all her strength: Divinity (who had the choice) did Name Reynolds? All Voices center'd in the same: Now here he stands and heads such Books as bear Truth in their Van, and Triumph in their Rear. R. W. AN EPITAPH For a Godly Mans Tomb. Here lies a piece of Christ, a Star in Dust; A Vein of Gold, a China Dish that must Be us'd in Heav'n, when God shall Feast the Just. AN EPITAPH For a Wicked Mans Tomb. Here lies the Carkase of a cursed Sinner, Doom'd to be Roasted, for the Devil's Dinner. [From a kind Hand there came t' enrich a place] From a kind Hand there came t' enrich a place In my poor Study,—the rare Works and Face Of Learned Reverend Reynolds—I receive The Book with joy—but no Gift (by your leave) And for the Book, and for my self, I vow I ne'r had Piece could make me Preach till now: I'll pay for't (Sir) And—(which I ne'r shall do) When I can write such—you shall print them too. Mean time I prophesie, this Volume will Make both your Rose and Crown to flourish still. Yours most Cordially, R. W. Alas poor Scholar, VVhither wilt thou go? OR Strange Alterations which at this time be, There's many did think they never should see. In a Melancholy Study, None but my self, Methought my Muse grew muddy; After seven years Reading, And costly breeding, I felt, but could find no pelf: Into Learned Rags I've rent my Plush and Satten, And now am fit to beg In Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; In stead of Aristotle, Would I had got a Patten. Alas poor Scholar! whither wilt thou go? Cambridge now I must leave thee, And follow Fate, Colledge hopes do deceive me! I oft expected To have been elected, But Desert is reprobate. Masters of Colledges Have no common Graces, And they that have Fellowships Have but common Places, And those that Scholars are They must have handsome faces: Alas poor Scholar, whither wilt thou go? I have bow'd, I have bended, And all in hope One day to be befriended. I have preach'd, I have printed What e'r I hinted, To please our English Pope: I worship'd towards the East, But the Sun doth now forsake me? I find that I am falling, The Northern winds do shake me: Would I had been upright, For Bowing now will break me: At great Preferment I aimed, Witness my Silk; But now my hopes are maimed: I looked lately To live most stately, And have a Dairy of Bell-ropes Milk; But now alas, My self I must not flatter, Bigamy of Steeples Is a laughing matter; Each man must have but one, And Curates will grow fatter. Alas poor Scholar, whither wilt thou go? Into some Country Village Now I must go, Where neither Tythe nor Tillage The greedy Patron And parched Matron Swear to the Church they owe: Yet if I can Preach, And pray too on a sudden, And confute the Pope At adventure, without studying, Then ten pounds a year, Besides a Sunday Pudding. All the Arts I have skill in, Divine and Humane, Yet all's not worth a Shilling; When the Women hear me, They do but jeer me, And say, I am profane: Once, I remember, I preached with a Weaver, I quoted Austin. He quoted Dod and Clever; I nothing got, He got a Cloak and Beaver: Alas poor Scholar, whither wilt thou go? Ships, Ships, Ships, I discover, Crossing the Main; Shall I in, and go over, Turn Jew, or Atheist, Turk, or Papist, To Geneva, or Amsterdam? Bishopricks are void In Scotland, shall I thither? Or follow Windebank And Finch, to see if either Do want a Priest to shrive them? O no, 'tis blust'ring weather. Alas poor Scholar, whither wilt thou go? Ho, ho, ho, I have hit it, Peace good-man Fool; Thou hast a Trade will fit it; Draw thy Indenture, Be bound at adventure An Apprentice to a Free-School; There thou mayst command By William Lylies Charter; There thou mayst whip, strip, And hang, and draw, and quarter, And commit to the Red Rod Both Will, and Tom, and Arthur. I, I, 'tis thither, thither will I go. R. W. THE Norfolk and Wisbich. COCK-FIGHT. By R. W. Go you tame Gallants, you that have a Name, And would accounted be Cocks of the Game; That have brave Spurs to shew for't, and can crow, And count all Dunghil-breed, that cannot show Such painted plumes as yours; which think't no vice With Cock-like lust to tread your Cockatrice; Though Peacocks, Weathercocks, Woodcocks you be, If y'are not Fighting Cocks, y'are not for me. I of two feathered Combatants will write; And he that means to th' life to express their Fight, his Ink the blood which they did spill, their dying Wings must take his quill. No were the doubtful People set, The Match made up, and all that would had bet; But straight the skilful Judges of the Play Brought forth their sharp-heel'd Warriors; &amp; they Were both in Linnen Bags, as if 'twere meet Before they dy'd, to have their Winding-sheet. Into the Pit they'r brought, and being there Upon the Stage, the Norfolk Chanticleer Looks stoutly at his ne'r-before-seen Foe, And like a Challenger began to crow, And clap his Wings, as if he would display His Warlike colours, which were black and gray. Mean time the wary Wisbich walks and breathes His active Body, and in fury wreaths His comely Crest; and often looking down, He beats his angry Beak upon the ground. This done, they meet, not like that coward Breed Of Æsope's these can better fight then feed: They scorn the Dunghil; 'tis their only prize To dig for Pearls within each others Eyes. They fought so nimbly, that 'twas hard to know, To th' skilful, whether they did fight or no; If that the blood which dy'd the fatal floor, Had not born witness of't. Yet fought they more, As if each wound were but a Spur to prick Their fury forward. Lightnings not more quick Or red, then were their Eyes: 'Twas hard to know Whether 'twas blood, or anger made them so. I'm sure they had been out, had they not stood More safe, being walled in each others blood. Thus they vy'd blows; but yet, alas, at length, Although their courage were ful tri'd, their strength And blood began to ebb. You that have seen A Watry Combat on the Sea, between Two angry-roaring-boiling Billows, how They march, and meet, and dash their curled brow; Swelling like graves, as though they did intend T'intomb each other, ere the quarrel end; But when the wind is down, and blustring weather, They are made friends, &amp; sweetly run together; May think these Champions such: their bloodgrows low And they which leap'd but now, now scarce can go For having left th' advantage of the Heel, Drunk with each others blood, they only reel; And yet they would fain fight: they came so near, Methought they meant into each others ear To whisper wounds; and when they could not rise They lay and look'd blows int' each others eyes. But now the Tragick part! After this fit, When Norfolk Cock had got the best of it, And Wisbich lay a dying, so that none, Though sober, but might venture seven to one, Contracting, like a dying Taper, all His strength, intending with the blow to fall, He struggles up, and having taken wind, Ventures a blow, and strikes the other blind. And now poor Norfolk, having lost his Eyes, Fights guided only by Antipathies: With him, alas! the Proverb is not true, The blows his Eyes ne'r saw, his heart must rue. At last, by chance, he stumbling on his Foe, Not having any strength to give a blow, He falls upon him with his wounded Head, And makes his Conquerors wings his Featherbed. His friends ran in, and being very chary, Sent in all haste to call a Pothecary: But all in vain, his body did so blister, That 'twas not capable of any Clyster. Physick's in vain, and 'twill not him restore; Alas poor Cock, he was let blood before Then finding himself weak, op'ning his Bill, He calls a Scrivener, and thus makes his Will; Imp. First of all, let never be forgot, My Body freely I bequeath to th' Pot, Decently to be boyl'd; and for its Tomb, Let it be buried in some hungry Womb, Item, For Executors I'll have none, But he that on my side laid seven to one; And, like a Gentleman that he may live, To him, and to his Heirs, my Comb I give, Together with my Brains, that all may know, That oftentimes his Brains did use to crow. Item, For Comfort of those Weaker ones Whose wives complain of, let them have my Stones For Ladies that are light, it is my Will, My Feathers make a Fan. And for my Bill; I'll give a Taylor: But 'faith 'tis so short, I am afraid, he'll rather curse me for't. And for that worthy Doctor's sake, who meant To give me a Clyster, let my Rump be sent. Lastly, because I find my self decay, I yield, and give to Wisbich Cock the day. R. W. UPON THE DEATH OF Dennis Bond, Esq; Who died four Dayes before the LORD PROTECTOR. Now whil'st Whitehall wears black, and men do fear 'Tis Treason any Colour else to wear; Whilst Mourners, like a flock of Crows, resort To the great Lion's Carcase, at the Court; Whilst the sad Members of the Tother House (That Mountain w?? last year brought forth a Mouse) Lament his Fall, who Madam'd all their Wives, And Thurloe wishes he had had nine Lives; Whilst some lament, he dy'd without an Ax, And fear the Funeral will cost Tax; Whilst cunning Scotland counterfeits a Groan, And Ireland cudgell'd into her Alone; Whilst England puts her Finger in her Eye, And Welchmen use their Leeks to make them cry; Whilst Grief doth chime All-in, and every Tribe Eycleped, Mayor and Aldermen, subscribe (Or make their Marks at least) how ful of Sadness That Oliver is dead, and eke of gladness That Richard reigns! though the Slaves lie, I fear, For their old Gowns are lin'd with Cavalier: Whilst the sad Poetasters of the times Plaister the Hearse with miserable Rhymes, And I, poor Man, might mend my Fortune too, As sure as ever Lord Hewson mended Shoo, If I could baste my Muse, and make her go: I, by that great Ghosts leave, am well content To wait upon a meaner Monument; Yet fit to stand by this, if not above, As having, though less Pomp, yet no less Love; 'Tis Dennis Bond, that true bred English Squire, Whose worth, if my rude Fancy should aspire To reach the Sinews; just, pious, valiant wise, Able for Counsel or for Enterprize; Fit to set Cato Copies, if alive, Able to make a Bankrupt Nation thrive; Th' Alchimy of whose single Judgement could Convert a Leaden Councel into Gold. Atlas of State! oh! if King Charls that's gone, In stead of Digby and old Cottington, Had had one Dennis; he had stood till now, And kept the Crown fast on his Royal Brow. Cromwel could not out-live him; so our State In one week lost their Pilot, and his Mate: And though he dy'd in's Bed, 'tis not deny'd; Yet was his Head struck off when Dennis dy'd. Adieu, brave Bond! My aged Muse shall burn Her with'red Lawrel at thy sacred Urn. Live thine own Monument, and scorn a Stone; Marbles themselves have flaws, thy Name has none That plat of Earth which grasps thee in her womb, Proud of such Treasure, swells into a Tomb. When the next Parliament together come, And miss their Western Patriot from his room, Despairing that their Meeting will not speed, Grief will dissolve them, no Protector need. R. W. Upon some Bottles of Sack and Claret, laid in Sand, and covered with a Sheet. Enter, and see this Tomb (Sirs) do not fear No Spirits, but of Wine, will fright you here: Weep o're this Tomb, your Sorrows here may have Wine for their sweet Companions in the Grave. A dozen Shakespears here interr'd do lie; Two dozen Johnsons full of Poetry. Did not the Mother Hogshead, from whose womb These Babes sprang forth, burst when she saw this Tomb, And swell with grief? Did not the Butler sink, To see himself turn Sexton to his Drink? 'Twere commendable Sacriledge, no doubt, Could I come at your Grave, to steal you out: Howe'er, from this thy anxious Grave I will Some virtuous Ashes take, wherewith I'll fill The Glass I preach by; for I must be just, There lies Divinity within thy Dust. Unhappy Grape, could not one pressing do, But now alive you must be buryed too? Sleep on, but scorn to die, immortal Liquer: The burying of thee thus will make thee quicker: Mean while thy Friends prayloud, that thou maist hive A speedy Resurrection from the Grave, AN ESSAY Upon the late VICTORY obtained by His Royal Highness the Duke of York, Against the DUTCH, upon June 3. 1665. By the Author of Iter Boreale. Gout! I conjure thee by the powerful Names Of CHARLES and JAMES, and their victorious Fames, On this great Day set all thy Prisoners free, (Triumphs command a Goal-Delivery) Set them all free, leave not a limping Toe From my Lord Chancellors to mine below; Unless thou giv'st us leave this day to dance, Thou'rt not th' old Loyal Gout, but com'st from France. 'Tis done, my grief obeys the Sovereign Charms, I feel a Bonfire in my joynts, which warms And thaws the frozen jelly; I am grown Twenty years younger; Victory hath done What puzled Physick: Give the Dutch a Rout, Probatum est, 'twill cure an English Gout. Come then, put nimble Socks upon my Feet, They shall be Skippers to our Royal Fleet, Which now returns in dances on our Seas, A Conqueror above Hyperboles. A Sea which with Bucephalus doth scorn Less then an Alexander should be born On her proud Back; but to a Loyal Rein Yields foaming Mouth, &amp; bends her curled Main: And conscious that she is too strait a Stage For Charls to act on, swell'd with Loyal Rage, Urgeth the Belgick and the Gallick shore To yield more room, Her Master must have more, Ingrateful Neighbours! 'twas our kinder Isle, With Her own Blood, made Your Geneva Stile Writ in small Print [Poor States and sore Perplext:] Swel to the [HIGH AND MIGHTY LORDS] in text; And can ye be such Snakes to sting that Breast Which in your Winter gave you Warmth &amp; Rest? Poor Flemish Frogs, if Your Ambition thirst To swell to English Greatness, You will burst. Could you believe Our Royal Head would fail To Nod those down, who fell before our Tail? Or could Your Amsterdam by her commands, Make London carry Coals to warm her Hands? A bold attempt! Pray practice it no more; We sav'd our Coals, yet gave you fire good store. It is enough; The righteous Heavens have now Judg'd the Grand Quarrel betwixt us and you. The Sentence is—The Surface must be ours, But for the bottom of the Sea 'tis yours: Thither your Opdam with some thousands, are Gone down to take possession of your share. Methinks I here great Triton sound a Call, And through th' affrighted Ocean summon all His scaly Regiments, to come and take Part of that Feast which Charls their King doth make; Where they may glut Revenge, quit the old score, And feed on those who fed on them before; Whom when they have digested, who can find Whether they're fish, or flesh, or what's their kind? Van-Cod, Van-Ling, Van-Herring, will be cry'd About their Streets; All Fish, so Dutchifi'd. The States may find their Capers in their Dish, And meet their Admirals in butter'd Fish. Thus they'l imbody and increase their Crew; A cunning way to make each Dutch-man two. And on themselves they now must feed or fast; Their Herring Trade is brought unto its Last. To the KING. Great Sir, Belov'd of God and Man, admit My Loyal zeal to run before my Wit. This is my Pens miscarriage, not a Birth; Her haste hath made her bring blind Puppies forth, My aims in this attempt, are to provoke, And kindle flames more Noble by my smoak; My wisp of straw may set great Wood on Fire, And my weak Breath Your Organs may inspire. Amongst those Flags y'have taken from the Dutch, Command your Denham to hang up his Crutch, He is a man both of his Hands and Feet, And with great numbers can your Navy meet, His quicker Eye Your Conquest can survey; His Hand, York's Temples Crown with flourishing Bay Waller (great Poet and true Prophet too) Whose curious Pencil in Rich Colours drew The Type of this grand Triumph for your view, (The Fishers (like their Herrings) bleeding new) With the same hand shal give the World the Sights Of what it must expect when England Fights. That Son and Heir of Pindars Muse and Fame, Your modest Cowley, with Your breath will flame, And make those Belgick Beasts, who live aspire To fall your Sacrifice in his pure Fire. He shall proclaim Our JAMES great Neptune's Wonder, And, like a Jove, Fighting in Clouds and Thunder. THE GRATEFUL NON-CONFORMIST: OR, Return of Thanks to Sir J. B. Knight who sent the Author Ten CROWNS 1665. Ten Crowns at once! and to one man! and he As despicable as bad Poets be! Who scarce has Wit (if you require the same) To make an Anagram upon your Name! Or to out-rime a Barber, or prepare An Epitaph to serve a Quinbrough Mayer! A limping Levite! who scarce in his prime Could woe an Abigal, or say Grace in rhime! Ten Crowns to such a Thing! Friend, 'tis a dose, Able to raise dead Ben, or Davenant's Nose; Able to make a Courtier prove a Friend, And more then all of them in Victuals spend. This free, free-Parliament, whose gift doth sound Full five and twenty hundred thousand pound: You have out-done them, for yours was your own, And some of it shall last when theirs is gon. Ten Crowns at once! and now at such a time, When Love to such as I am, is a Crime Greater then his Recorded in Jane Shore, Who gave but one poor loaf to the starv'd Whore. What, now to help a Non-Conformist! Now When Ministers are broke that will not bow! When 'tis to be unblest to be ungirt! To wear no Surplice, doth deserve no shirt: No Broth, no Meat; no Service, no Protection; No Cross, no Coin; no Collect, no Collection! You are a daring Knight, thus to be kind; If trusty Roger get it in the wind Hee'l smell a Plot, a Presbyterian Plot, Especially for what you gave the Scot! And if the Spiritual Court take fire from Crack, They'l clap a Pariter upon your back: Shall make you shrug, as if you wore the Collar Of a Cashier'd Red-coat, or poor Scholar. What will you plead, Sir, if they put you to't? Was it the Doctor, or the Knight did do't? Did you as Doctor, flux some Usurer? And with your quick, did his dull Silver stir? Or did your Zeal, you a Knight-Templer make, To give the Church the booties you should take? Or was it your desire to beg Applause? Or shew affection to the good old Cause? Was't to feed Faction, or uphold the stickle Betwixt the old Church and new Conventicle? No, none of these, but I have hit the thing, It was because you knew I lov'd the King. Ten Crowns at once! Sir you'l suspected be For no good Protestant, you are so free. So much at once! sure you ne'r gave before, Or else, I doubt, mean to do so no more. This is enough to make a man protest Religio Medici to be the best. The Christians, for whose sakes we are undone, Would have cry'd out, oh! 'tis too much for one Either to give or take! what needs this wast? Oh, how they love to have us keep a Fast! Five private Meetings, (where at each, four men In black coats, and white caps, (you'l call them then A teem of Ministers) have tug'd all day, Deserving Provender, but scarce got hey; Where I my self have drawn my part some hours, Have not afforded such return as yours. I'de wish them watch, and keep me sober still; Not want of guilt in them, nor want of will In me, but want of Wine does make me lame, Or else I'de sacrifice them to the flame Of a high blazing Satyr. Here's a man Who ne'r pretended at your rates, yet can More freely feed us, with Wine and good Dishes, Then they (yet that's their alms) with sighs and wishes Oh, for a Rapture! how shall I describe The love of thousands to their Reading Tribe! Who so maintaind them, when they lost their places They did not loose one pimple from their faces; But after all, full fraught with flesh and flaggon, Came forth like Monks, or Priests of Bel &amp; Dragon One would have judg'd by their high looks &amp; smels They had been kept in Cellars, not in Cells: Where they grew big and batten'd; without doubt Some that went Firkins in, came Hogs heads out. But ours in two years time are skin and bones, And look like Gran-dames, or old Apple Johns: One Lazarus amongst us was too much, But ere't be long we all shall look like such; And when that comes to pass, the world shall see, Who are the Ghostly Fathers, they or we; And then our bellies (without better fare) Will be as empty as their Noddles are: Though we are silent, our guts will not be so, But make a Conventicle as they go: Poor Colon peace, and cease thy croking din, Thou art condemn'd to be a Chitterlin. Niggardly Puritans! blush at the odds Betwixt the Bonners and the meagre Dodds; You give your Drink in Thimbles, they in Bowls, Your Church is poor St. Faiths and theirs is Pauls; And whilst you Priests and Altars do despise, Your selves prove Priests, and we your Sacrifice. But why do I permit my Muse to whine? I wish my Brethren all such cheeks as mine, And those that wish us well, such hearts as thine. My Noble Baber, I have chosen you For my Physitian, and my Champion too; Give me but sometimes such a dose, and I Will ne'r wish other Cordial till I die, And then Proclaim you a most Valiant Knight, (Shew but such Mettle) though you never Fight. A POEM UPON THE Imprisonment OF M?. CALAMY In NEWGATE. This Page I send you Sir, your Newgate Fate Not to condole, but to congratulate. I envy not our Mitred men, their Places, Their rich Preferments, nor their richer Faces: To see them Steeple upon Steeple set, As if they meant that way to Heaven to get. I can behold them take into their Gills A dose of Churches, as men swallow Pills, And never grieve at it: Let them swim in Wine While others drown in tears, i'le not repine, But my heart truly grudges (I confess) That you thus loaded are with happiness; For so it is: And you more blessed are In Peters Chain, than if you set in's Chair. One Sermon hath preferr'd you so much Honour, A man could scarce have had from Bishop Bonner; Whilst we (your Brethren) poor Erraticks be, You are a glorious fixed Star we see. Hundreds of us turn out of House and Home, To a safe Habitation you are come. What though it be a Goal? Shame and Disgrace Rise only from the Crime, not from the place. Who thinks reproach or injuries is done By an Eclipse to the unspotted Sun? He only by that black upon his brow Allures spectators more; and so do you. Let me find Honey, though upon a Rod, And prize the Prison, where my Keeper's God: Newgate or Hell were Heav'n, if Christ were there, He made the Stable so, and Sepulcher. Indeed the place did for your presence call; Prisons do want perfuming most of all. Thanks to the Bishop, and his good Lord Mayor, Who turn'd the Den of Thieves into a House of Prayer: And may some Thief by you converted be, Like him who suffer'd in Christs company. Now would I had sight of your Mittimus; Fain would I know why you are dealt with thus. Jaylor, set forth your Prisoner at the Bar, Sir, you shall hear what your offences are. First, It is prov'd that you being dead in Law (As if you car'd not for that death a straw) Did walk and haunt your Church, as if you'ld scarce Away the Reader and his Common-Prayer. Nay 'twill be prov'd you did not only walk, But like a Puritan your Ghost did talk. Dead, and yet Preach! these Presbyterian slaves Will not give over Preaching in their Graves. Item, You play'd the Thief, and ift be so, Good reason (Sir) to Newgate you should go: And now you're there, some dare to swear you are The greatest Pick-pocket that e're came there: Your Wife too, little better then your self you make, She is th' Receiver of each Purse you take. But your great Theft, you act it in your Church, (I do not mean you did your Sermon lurch, That's crime Canonical) but you did pray And preach, so that you stole mens hearts away. So that good man to whom your place doth fall, Will find they have no heart for him at all: This Felony deserv'd Imprisonment; What can't you Non-conformists be content Sermons to make except you preach them too; They that your places have, this Work can do. Thirdly, 'tis prov'd, when you pray most devout For all good men, you leave the Bishops out: This makes Seer Sheldon by his powerful spel Conjure and lay you safe in Newgate-hell: Would I were there too, I should like it wel. I would you durst swap punishment with me; Pain makes me fitter for the company Of roaring boys; and you may lie a bed, Now your Name's up; pray do it in my stead, And if it be deny'd us to change places, Let us for sympathy compare our cases; For if in suffering we both agree, Sir, I may challenge you to pity me: I am the older Goal-bird; my hard fate Hath kept me twenty years in Cripple-gate; Old Bishop Gout, that Lordly proud disease, Took my fat body for his Diocess, Where he keeps Court, there visits every Limb, And makes them (Levite-like) conform to him, Severely he doth Article each joint, And makes enquiry into every point: A bitter enemy to preaching; he Hath half a year sometimes suspended me: And if he find me painful in my station, Down I am sure to go next Visitation: He binds up, looseth; sets up and pulls down; Pretends he draws ill humours from the Crown: But I am sure he maketh such ado, His humors trouble Head and members too: He hath me now in hand, and e're he goes, I fear for Hereticks he'l burn my toes. O! I would give all I am worth, a fee, That from his jurisdiction I were free. Now Sir, you find our sufferitgs do agree, One Bishop clapt up you, another me: But oh! the difference too is very great, You are allow'd to walk, to drink and eat, I want them all, and never a penny get. And though you be debarr'd your liberty, Yet all your Visitors I hope are free, Good Men, good Women, and good Angels come And make your Prison better then your home. Now may it be so till your foes repent They gave you such a rich Imprisonment. May for the greater comfort of your lives, Your lying in be better then your Wives. May you a thousand friendly papers see, And none prove empty, except this from me. And if you stay may I come keep your door, Then farewel Parsonage, I shall ne'r be poor. ON THE DEATH OF M?. CALAMY, Not known to the Author of a long time after. Anno 1667. And must our Deaths be silenc'd too! I guess 'Tis some dumb Devil hath possest the Press; Calamy dead without a Publication! 'Tis great injustice to our English Nation: For had this Prophet's Funeral been known, It must have had an Universal Groan; Afflicted London would then have been found In the same year to be both burn'd and drown'd; And those who found no Tears their flames to quench, Would yet have wept a Showre, his Herse to drench. Methinks the Man who stuffs the Weekly Sheet, With fine New-Nothings, what hard Names did meet. The Emp'ress, how her Petticoat was lac'd, And how her Lacquyes Liveries were fac'd; What's her chief Woman's Name; what Dons do bring Almonds and Figs to Spain's great little King: Is much concern'd if the Pope's Toe but akes, When he breaks Wind, and when a Purge he takes; He who can gravely advertise, and tell Where Lockier and Rowland Pippin dwell; Where a Black-Box or Green-Bag was lost; And who was Knighted, though not what it cost: Methinks he might have thought it worth the while, Though not to tell us who the State beguile, Or what new Conquest England hath acquired; Nor that poor Trifle who the City fired; Though not how Popery exalts its head, And Priests and Jesuits their poyson spread; Yet in swoln Characters he might let fly, The Presbyterians have lost an Eye. Had Crackf?'s Fiddle been in tune, (but he Is now a Silenc'd Man as well as We) He had struck up loud Musick, and had plaid A Jig for joy that Calamy was laid; He would have told how many Coaches went; How many Lords and Ladies did lament; What Handkerchiefs were sent, and in them Gold To wipe the Widows, he would have told; All had come out, and we beholden all To him, for th' ovreflowing of his gall. But why do I thus Raut without a cause? Is not Concealment Policy? Whose Laws My silly peevish Muse doth ill t'oppose: For publick Losses no Man should disclose; And such was this, a greater loss by far, One Man of God then, twenty Men of War; It was a King, who when a Prophet dy'd, Wept over him, and Father, Father cry'd. O if thy Life and Ministry be done, My Chariots and Horsemen, strength is gone. I must speak sober words, for well I know If Saints in Heaven do hear us here below, A lye, though in his Praise, would make him frown, And chide me, when with Jesus he comes down To judge the World.—This little little He, This silly, sickly, silenc'd Calamy, Aldermanbury's Curate, and no more, Though he a mighty Miter might have wore, Could have vi'd Interest in God or Man, With the most pompous Metropolitan: How have we known him captivate a throng, And made a Sermon twenty thousand strong; And though black-mouths his Loyalty did charge, How strong his tug was at the Royal Barge, To hale it home, great GEORGE can well attest, Then, when poor Prelacy lay dead in'ts nest; For if a Collect could not fetch him home, Charles must stay out, that Interest was mum. Nor did Ambition of a Miter, make Him serve the Crown, it was for Conscience sake. Unbribed Loyalty! his highest reach Was to be Master Calamy, and preach. He bless'd the King, who Bishop him did name, And I bless him who did refuse the same. O! had our Reverend Clergy been as free To serve their Prince without Reward, as he, They might have had less Wealth with greater Love: Envy, like Winds, endangers things above; Worth, not Advancement, doth beget esteem; The highest Weathercock the least doth seem. If you would know of what disease he dy'd, His grief was Chronical it is reply'd. For had he opened been by Surgeons art, They had found London burning in his heart; How many Messengers of death did he Receive with Christian Magnanimity! The Stone, Gout, Dropsie, Ills which did arise Form Griefs and Studies, not from Luxuries; The Megrim too, which still strikes at the Head; These he stood under, and scarce staggered. Might he but work, though loaded with these Chains, He Pray'd and Preach'd, and sung away his pains. Then by a fatal Bill he was struck dead, And though that blow he ne're recovered, (For he remained speechless to his close) Yet did he breath, and breath out Prayers for those From whom he had that wound: he liv'd to hear An hundred thousand buried in one Year, In his Dear City, over which he wept, And many Fasts to keep off Judgments kept; Yet, yet he liv'd, stout heart, he liv'd to be Depriv'd, driv'n out, and kept out, liv'd to see Wars, Blazing-Stars, Torches, which Heav'n nev'r burns, But to light Kings or Kingdoms to their Urns. He liv'd to see the Glory of our Isle, London, consumed in its Funeral Pile. He liv'd to see that lesser day of Doom, London, the Priests Burnt-sacrifice to Rome; That blow he could not stand, but with that Fire, As with a Burning Feaver, did expire. Thus dy'd this Saint, of whom it must be said, He dy'd a Martyr, though he dy'd in's bed. So Father Eli in the Sacred page Sat quivering with fear, as much as age, Longing to know, yet loth to ask the News, How it far'd with the Army of the Jews. Israel flies, that struck his Palsie-head; The next blow stunned him, Your Sons are dead; But when the third stroke came, The Ark is lost; His heart was wounded, and his life it cost. Thus fell this Father, and we well do know He fear'd our Ark was going long ago. The EPITAPH. Here a poor Minister of Christ doth lie, Who did INDEED a Bishoprick deny. When his Lord comes, then, then the World shall see Such humble Ones, the rising-Men shall be. How many Saints whom he had sent before, Shouted to see him enter Heavens door: There his blest Soul beholds the face of God, While we below groan out our Ichabod. Under his burned-Church his Body lies, But shall it self a glorious Temple rise: May his kind flock when a new Church they make, Call it St. Edmundsbury for his sake. R. W. THE Loyal-Nonconformist; OR An Account what he dare swear and what he dare not swear. Published in the year, 1666. I fear an Oath, before I swear to take it; And well I may, for 'tis the Oath of God: I fear an Oath, when I have sworn, to break it: And well I may, for Vengeance hath a Rod. And yet I may swear, and must too, 'tis due Both to my Heav'nly, and my Earthly King; If I assent, it must be full and true; And if I promise, I must do the thing, I am no Quaker, not at all to swear; Nor Papist, to swear East, and mean the West; But am a Protestant, and shall declare What I cannot, and what I can protest. I never will endeavour Alteration Of Monarchy, nor of that Royal Name, Which God hath chosen to command this Nation, But will maintain his Person, Crown and Fame: What he commands, if Conscience say not nay, (For Conscience is a greater King then he) For Conscience-sake, not Fear, I will obey; And if not Active, Passive I will be. I'll pray that all his Subjects may agree, And never more be crumbled into parts; I will endeavour that his Majestie May not be King of Clubs, but King of Hearts. The Royal Oak I swear I will defend; But for the Ivy which doth hug it so, I swear that is a Thief, and not a friend, And about Steeples fitter far to grow. The Civil-Government I will obey; But for Church-Policy I swear I doubt it; And if my Bible want th' Apocrypha, I'l swear my Book may be compleat without it. I dare not swear Church-Government is right As it should be; but this I dare to swear, (If they should put me to't) the Bishops might Do better, and be better than they are. Nor will I swear for all that they are worth, That Bishopricks will stand, and Doomsday see; And yet I'l swear the Gospel holdeth forth Christ with his Ministers till then will be. That Peter was a Prelat they aver; But I'l not swear't when all is said and done: But I dare swear, and hope I shall not err, He preach'd a hundred Sermons to their one. Peter a Fisher was, and he caught Men: And they have Nets, and in them catch Men too; Yet I'l not swear they are alike, for them He caught he sav'd: these catch, and them undo. I dare not swear that Courts Ecclesiastick Do in their Laws make just and gentle Votes; But I'l be sworn that Burton, Pryn and Bastwick Were once Ear-witnesses of harsher Notes. Archdeacons, Deans and Chapters are brave men, By Canon, not by Scripture: but to this, If I be call'd, I'l swear, and swear agen, That no such Chapter in my Bible is. I'll not condemn those Presbyterians, who Refused Bishopricks, and might have had 'em: But Mistris Calamy I'll swear doth do As well as if she were a Spiritual Madam. I will not swear, that they who this Oath take, Will for Religion e're lay down their Lives: But I will swear they will good Juglers make, Who can already swallow down such Knives. For Holy Vestments I'll not take an Oath Which Linen most Canonical may be; Some are for Lawn, some Holland, some Scotscloth; And Hemp for some is fitter than all three. Paul had a Cloak, and Books, and Parchments too; But that he wore a Surplice I'll not swear, Nor that his Parchments did his Orders shew, Or in his Books there was a Common-Prayer. I owe assistance to the King by Oath; And if he please to put the Bishops down, As who knows what may be, I should be loth To see Tom Beckets Miter push the Crown. And yet Church-Government I do allow, And am contented Bishops be the men; And that I speak in earnest, here I vow Where we have one, I wish we might have ten. In fine, the Civil Power I'll obey, And seek the Peace and Welfare of the Nation: If this won't do, I know not what to say, But farewel London, farewel Corporation. R.W. THE RECANTATION Of A Penitent Proteus; OR, The Changling. As it was acted with good Applause in St. Maries in Cambridge, and St. Pauls in London, 1663. To the Tune of Dr. Faustus. [The First Part] Proteus his penal Resolution, speaking alone in the Tyring-house before his entring the Pulpit. Oh I am almost mad, 'twould make one so, To see which way Preferments game doth go. I ever thought I had her in the Wind, And yet I'm cast above three years behind. Three times already I have turn'd my Coat; Three times already I have chang'd my Note: Il'e make it four and four and twenty more, And turn the Compass round ere I'le give ore. Love to Church-members I will give no more; For now I'le only court the Scarlet Whore. I'le ask the Bishops blessing; and good-night To Thomas Goodwyn, and his Child of Light. Poor man, he wears his Capps too much in's eyes To be my Guide, No, I must be more wise. On all my Brethren I will look awry, And cry, Stand farther off to Philip Nye. Ambition, my great Goddess and my Muse, Inspire thy Prophets all such Arts to use, As may exalt; Betwixt this and my Grave A Miter, or a Halter, I must have. Tell me (Ambition) prethee tell me why So many Dunces Doctors and not I? A Scarlet Gown I must and will obtain, I cannot else commence a Priest in grain. Among the Doctors I can get no room Till I recant; that is my shameful doom. Hang shame, I'le do it, and my end's to gain, I'le cant, recant, and re-recant again. Now help me great Ambition, for thy sake To break my sleep, to break my Brains, to break My Faith and Oaths, and so to act my part, That men may think I have a broken Heart. When I do preach my tears do trickle down; But in my sleeve (my Cassock sleeves and Gown) I laugh, to think how by my whining trade So many Fools in one day I have made. Help me, my Muse, a new Song I desire By thee may be prepared for the Quire, That when my Recantation Sermon's done, This Penitential Anthem may be sung. But yet one thing ere I begin, I crave A benefit, which Poets use to have, That now and then, to make my Rimes agree, What ends in Lie, may be pronounced LEE. The Second Part; Or, the Changling in the Pulpit. Attend good People, lay by scoffs and scorns, Let Round-heads all this day pull in their Horns, But let Conformists and brave Caveliers Unto my doleful Tone prick up their Ears. Take from my neck this Robe, a Rop's more fit, And turn this Surplice to a Penance-sheet, This Pulpit is too good to act my part, More fit to preach at Tyburn in a Cart: There I deserv'd t' have taken my degree, And Doctor Dun should have presented me; There with an Hempen Hood I should be sped, And his three-corner'd Cap should crown my head. Here I am come to hold up guilty hand, And of the Beast to give my self the brand; Here, by confessing I have been i'th wrong, I come to bore my self through my own tongue. In Learning my poor Parents brought up me; And sent me to the Universitie; There I soon found bowing the way to rise: And th' only Logick was the Falacies. In stead of Aristotles Organon, Anthems and Organs I did study on; If I could play on them, I soon did find, I rightly had Preferment in the wind. I follow'd that hot scent without controul, I bow'd my body, and I sung Fa Sol; I cozen'd Doctor Couzens, and ere long A Fellowship obtained for a Song. Then by degrees I climb'd, until I got Good Friends, good Cloaths, good Commons, and what not? I got so long, until at length I got A Wench with Child, and then I got a blot. Before the Consistory I was try'd, Where like a Villain I both swore and ly'd, And from the Whore I made I was made free, By purging of my self Incont'nent-LEE. But as I scorn'd to father mine own Brat, 'Twas done to me as I had done with That; The Doctors all, when Doctor I would be, As a base son, refus'd to father me. With much ado, at length by art and cunning, My Tears &amp; Vows prevail'd with Peter Gunning Me to adopt; and for his love and care, I will devote my self to Peter's Chair. Cambridge I left with grief and great disgrace, To seek my fortune in some other place; And that I might the better save my stake, I took an Order, and did Orders take. Amongst Conformists I my self did list, A Son o'th Church as good as ever pist. But though I bow'd, and cring'd, &amp; crost &amp; all, I only got a Vicarage very small. Ere I was warm (and warm I ne're had bin In such a starved hole as I was in) A Fire upon the Church and Kingdom came, Which I straight helpt to blow into a flame. To the same Tune. The Third Part. My Conscience first, like Balaam's Asse, was shy, Bogled and winc'd; which when I did espy, I cudgeld her, and spur'd her on each side, Until the Jade her paces all could ride. When first I mounted on her tender back, She would not leave the Protestant dull Rack, Till in her mouth the Cov'nant Bit I got, And made her learn the Presbyterian Trot; 'Twas an hard Trot, and fretted her (alas) The Independent Amble easier was, I taught her that, and out of that to fall To the Tantivy of Prelatical. I rode her once to Rumford with a pack Of Arguments for th' Cov'nant on her back. That Journey she perform'd at such a rate, Th' Committee gave me a rich piece of Plate. From Hatfield to St. Albans I did ride, The Army call'd for me to be their Guide; There I so spurd her, that I made her fling, Not only dirt, but blood upon my King. When Cromwel turn'd his Masters out by force, I made the Beast draw like a Brewers horse; Under the Rump I made her wear a Crooper, And under Lambert she became a Trooper. When Noble Monk the KING did home conveigh, She (like Darius Steed) began to neigh. I taught her since to Organ Pipes to prance, As Banks his Horse could to a Fiddle dance. Now with a Snaffle, or a twined thread, To any Government she'l turn her head: I have so broke her, she doth never start, And that's the meaning of my broken heart. I have found out a cunning way with ease, To make her cast her Coat when ere I please; And if at Rack and Manger she may be, Her Colts tooth she will keep most Wanton-LEE. I'l change as often as the Man i'th Moon; [His frequent Changing makes him rise so soon] To eat Church Plumb-broth e're it all be gone, I'le have the Devil's spoon but I'le have One. For many years my Tongue did lick the Rump; But when I saw a KING was turn'd up Trump, I did resolve still in my hand to have One winning Card, although 'twere but a Knave. If the Great Turk to England come, I can Make Gospel truckle to the Alchoran; And if their Turkish Sabbaths should take place, I have in readiness my Friday face. If lockt in Iron Chest (as we are told) A Loadstone their great Mahomet can hold: The Loadstone of Preferment (I presage) To Mahomet may draw this Iron Age. The Congregation way best pleas'd my mind; There were more Shees, and they most free and kind: By Chamber practice I did better thrive, Than all my Livings, though I skimmed five. Mine Eyes are open now my Sins to see, With Tears I cry, Good People Pardon me; My Reverend Fathers Pardon I do crave, And hope my Mothers Blessing yet to have. My Cambridge sins, my Bugden sins are vile, My Essex sins, my sins in Ely-Isle, My Leicester sins, my Hatfield sins are many, But my St. Albans sins more red than any. To CHARLES the first I was a bloody foe, I wish I do not serve the Second so: The only way to make me leave that trick, Is to bestow on me a Bishoprick. This is St. Andrews Eve, and for his sake A Bishoprick in Scotland I could take; And though a Metropolitan there be, I'de be as Sharp, and full as Arch as he. Now may this Sermon never be forgot, Let others call't a Sermon, I a Plot, A Plot that takes, if it believed be; If not I shall repent Unfained-LEE. I must desire the Crack-fart of the Nation, With rev'rance to let fly this Recantation; Our Names ty'd tail to tail, make a sweet change, Mine only is Strange-Lee, and his Le-strange. THE PORING DOCTOR, OR The Gross mistake of a Reverend Son of the Church, in bowing at the name of Judas at St. Pauls, November 5. 1663. The Papists, God wot, made a notable Plot Against the Church and the State; Which some with good reason, Call Gunpowder-Treason, Discover'd ere 'twas too late. Those who before, Had weltred in gore Of Protestant Martyrs slain, Resolv'd with one breath, Of Hell beneath, To blow up all by a Train The Bishops, good men, Were in jeopardy then, The Lords, the Commons, the King; Religion, and Laws, For the Catholick Cause To be made a Burnt Offring. Thus swell'd with dispight, To raise darkness and night, Heav'n caused the brood to miscarry; That day big with Thunder, Held forth Mercies wonder, And therefore kept Anniversary. You the present Lord Mayor, And Brethren repair, With the several Corporations, To Pauls Church to pray, And solemnize the Day That so seasonably saved three Nations. But good Doctor— When he came before ye The Sacred Gospel to read, At Judas his name, (O horrible shame!) He bowed his Reverend head. Some say that his sight (Poor man) is not right, I wish that it be no worse; But others think he, To Judas bow'd th' knee, For love he bears to the Purse. His Worship made doubt, Where the battel was fought, When Michael did prevail; But to me it is clear, For an hundred a year He'l bow to the Dragons Tail. Twelve Spiritual Promotions, A head full of Notions, With stomach more sharp than a Sythe, Some of Bishopsgate there, Perhaps did appear, Whose Cloaths were pawn'd for his Tythe. These things set before, And some small reasons more, His slender wit had overthrown, Nor can he tell how, To read, cring or bow By any one's Book but his own. What then shall we say, Can he Preach, can he Pray, Or put to rebuke the Gainsayer, Who in reading the Word, Discerns not our Lord From him that was his betrayer? Sure this doting Fool, Must once more to School Before his return to the Altar, Such another mistake, May possibly make His neck to deserve a Silk H? THE FAIR QUARREL. By way of Letter, Between Mr. Wanley, a Son of the Church; and Dr. Wilde, a Nonconformist. Published in the Year, 1666. [1.] Mr. Nathan Wanley to Dr. Wild, who was laid aside for Nonconformity. So the bright Taper useless burns To private and recluded Urns. So Pearls themselves to shels confine, And Gems in the Seas bottom shine, As thou my WILD while thou dost lye Huddled up in thy privacy, And only now and then dost send A Letter to thy private Friend; Take once again thy Lyre, and so Let thy selected Numbers flow, As when thy solemn Muse did prove To sing the Funeral of Love; Or, as when with the Trump of fame Thou didst sound forth great George's name, In such a strain, as might it be, Did speak thy self as great as he. For while great Cowley seeks the shade, And Denham's noble Wit's mislaid; When Davnant's weary Quill lies by, And yeelds no more of Lumbardy; While the sweet Virgin Muses be By Wild led int' a Nunnerie; While thus Apollo's Priests retire, The Females do begin t' aspire, Pretending they have found a flaw In great Apollo's Salique Law; These grasp at Lawrel, only due To such as I have nam'd, and you. Dr. Wild to the Ingenious Mr. Wanley. What jolly Shepherds voice is this Would tempt me from my private bliss, After his Pipe to dance, while Thunder Threatens to rend that Oak in sunder, Under whose boughs in fairer dayes We sate secure, and sang the Praise Of our great Pan, whose care did keep The pleasent Shepherds and their Sheep? Is this a time with wanton strains To whistle forth the Nymphs and Swains To sport amd dance, while Wolf and Fox Lye lurking to devour our Flocks, And Romes Sheep-stealers ready stand To give them their red letters brand? Dost thou not know, my sanguine Son, What th' Plague and Fire have lately done? London hath sent up such a smoke, As may the Angels voices choake, And make tears big enough, to vent Tears in a deluge, to lament The raging fury of that Flame, But more of those that made the same. And when St. Paul has lost his Quire, 'Twere Sacriledge to touch my Lyre. None but a monster Nero may Over a burning City play. Nor would I sing, were I a Jew, To please a Babylonish Crew. Now since the time for sorrow cryes, In this I freely temporize. So the bright Starrs draw in their light, When Clouds club for an ugly night. So all the Birds of Musick sleep On stormy dayes, and Silence keep. So frost-nipt Roses droop and fall, Perfuming their own funerall. So you have seen a well-tun'd Lyre Swelling it self with grief and ire. In gloomy air, each heart-broke string Its own last passing-bell doth ring. So when Bellona's Trumpet sounds, Our softer Muses Musick drownds. Sir, by my many soes you know My Poetry is but so so. But why dost thou disdain or fear, That Female brows should Lawrel wear? Hast thou forgot that Noble Tree It self was made out of a shee? The Muses and the Graces all We of the Female Gender call; And so if you have not more care, You'l find the Furies likewise are. Nor would I have you wonder why Our Poets all amort do lye, When Claret and Canary cease, The Wits will quickly hold their peace. Vintnars and Poets fall together, If once the Ivey-Garland wither. Sweet Cowly thought (as well he might) He should have shin'd in Phœbus sight; But Clouds appear'd, and he that made Account of Juno, found a shade; And though on Davids Harp he plaid, The evil Spirit can't be laid: Therefore the Groves and Shades he loves, And his own Secretary proves. Your next mans temples Lawrel scorns; Since greater pride his brows adorns. He to Pernass. bears no good will, Because it proves a horned hill. The very thoughts whereof I dread Will ne're be got out of his head. Gondebert's silent, I suppose, Because his Muse sings through the nose, One syllable of which poor he Did lose by an Apocope. Wild sayes, kind Wanley you'r to blame Amongst these Swans his Goose to name, Yea though his lucky gagling yaul Once help to save one Capital; His love to Love then made him fear His neck, not brow, a Wreath should wear. Next he did one a Loyal string His Georgicks and his Carols sing; But now because he cannot toot To Organ tunes, he's made a mute; And though alive, condemn'd to death: Therefore, dear Sir, in vain your breath, Although perfum'd and hot does come, To blow wind in a dead mans bumb; Yet as a greateful Legacy, He leaves to thee his Nunnery, Not doubting but if need require Thou'lt prove an able loving Fryar. 2. Mr. Wanley to Dr. Wild. What sullen wary Shepherds voice is this, That won't be tempted from his private bliss, But arbor'd up in Eglantine, while Thunder Threatens to rend and rive that Oak in sunder, Under whose boughs himself in fairer dayes Did sit secure with us, and sang the praise Of that great Pan, whose watchful care did keep At once the pleasant Shepherd and his Sheep? Is this a time for Shepherds to retreat, And seek out Coverts from the scorching heat? Is this a time for an inglorious sloth To hug it self, not daring to peep forth Into the open field, while th' crafty Fox Lurks in the bushes to devour our Flocks, And Wolves of Romulus are grown so bold, To fright the silly Sheep ev'n in their Fold? Dost thou not know what crops the Plauge his made And, Sampson-like, heaps upon heaps has laid? That if Heav'ns wrathful Anger thus proceed, There will no Flocks be left for thee to feed. London has sent up such a darkning smoak, And shall it too the Angels voices choak? Shall it make Clouds so thick and dark, that we Shall never more thy publick Censers see? 'Tis Sacriledge to rob the Church; and thence Since you have stole your self, what's your offence? When the white Harvest for more Reapers cryes, How canst thou freely sit and temporize? So Stars reserve themselves for pitchy night, When Phœbus pouders all his locks with light So feral Birds delight to sit alone, Till the Days glories are packt up and gone. So Roses fall in June when frosts are past, And on dull earth lye blushing out their last, So the Musitian smothers his Sol fa, When he's entreated or to sing or play. So when the fierce Bellona's Drums do beat, Who has no mind to fight, seeks his retreat. And so I've seen a long miswonted Lyre Sigh its own Dirge with its own broken wire, And seems to shiv'r at th' downfal of Paul's Quire. Say we not well, Agues will have their course? Yes, yes, they must remember with remorse The Ivy Garland's withering, dearth of Liquer, That would make Caput Mortuum the quicker But why shouldst thou, kind soul, be in such fear, That plump Lyceus should grow lean this year? Hast thou forgot how fatal the Grape-stone Did whilom prove to poor Anacreon? Which of the Muses or the Graces all, Did ere for Claret or Canary call? Is it not sung by the Venetian Swain, How the brisk Wine gives Horns to the poor man? And if you have no greater care, no doubt You'l find the Claret will revive your Gout, And then we shall hear thy Goose-gagling yaul Cry out for help to save thy Pedestal; Then we shall see thee, standing on one foot, Practise worse tunes than Organs ever toot. This is a vain presage; thou say'st, the Dead Have out-liv'd this, and have no Gout to dread. But art thou dead indeed? Though dead thou art, Heark how the dead mans bum does let a fart. When as my bashful Muse did to thee come, 'Twas not so kindly done to turn thy bum; To vote her of the Babylonish Crew; And set the Furies on her with ha-loo. This 'tis to gad abroad, 'tis just upon her; Had Dina kept at home, shee'd sav'd her Honor. But I'm thy Son, and must corrected be; But why then dost thou turn thy bum to me? Dost think thy Son so sanguine and insano, To probe thee with a Fistula in Ano. This I should leave to any of the Crew, You may believe me though I were a Jew. And may my breath be still perfum'd, why not? Since dead Corps smell when they begin to rot. And he whose Muse such wondrous heights did fly, That it did seem to top the very Sky; And though he may have reason to be proud, Instead of Juno did imbrace a Cloud; May he resume King Davids Harp and play The Tarantul' of discontent away. If Denhams has so fouly bin betray'd, And his Inclosure 'gainst his will survey'd: May he recover all his Wits and more, And with such keen Iambricks brand the Whore, That all may dread it worse then loss of life, To turn a Poet frantick for his Wife. Poor Davenant's Nose it seems is grown so sore, It scarcely will abide one smart Jest more. Well may the bridge be down, when time doth meet To press it with his Satyr cloven feet. And thou with thy Apocopes art wont To scater balls of thy Wild-fire upon't. But shall I not, kind Wild, remember thee, Who hast bequeath'd me such a Legacie? 'Tis thine for life, we know thy subtile head; Wills have no force till the Testator's dead; And that none can have ought by thy bequest Till thou art better dead then in a Jest: Nor would I that in tenderness to me Thou shoulst suspect thine own sufficiencie; Enjoy it freely, since thou hast it wed, 'Tis Incest to ascend the Fathers bed. What though thou ownst me for thy sanguine Child, Yet I have not so much my Sire of Wild. And thus far is thy Fry'r able to see His Covent's better than thy Nunnerie. He's loving too, 'tis true, he nothing gives, As thou, at his decease, but while he lives All these good wishes, such as he can spare. And if thou hast them, will help mend thy fare. May every Knight about us, that's inclind, Be unto thee, as Sir John Baber, kind. Ten Silver Crowns let each of them send thee, And be so paid for all in Verse as he. May the poor Scholar ne're want Sunday Pudden, When he's not like to preach for't on the sudden. May thy afflicted Toe ne're feel the Gout; Or if it must, let the Dutch have a Rout; That thou maiest yet (at last) once more Protest That Recipe wants no Probatum est. Maist thou next send me what is worth thy Pen; May I have brains to answer it agen. May all that are of such good wishes sullen, Live till their good Friends bury them in Woolen. Dr. Wild to Mr. Wanley. Honestly done however, though the Stuff You sent be course the measure's large enough. The first Cup thou beganst I could not pass, The Wine was brisk, and in a little glass: But now to pledge thee I am not inclin'd, You Sons o'th Church are for large draughts I find. Prithee leave off, for thou hast been so free In sending such a brimmer unto me, That Sunday last, long of that frolick bout, Thy Parish had but half a glass I doubt. Besides the drink is small, you've chang'd your gill, I wish you'd kept in your hogs-head still. Yet, upon better thoughts, small drink is fit To cool the stomack, though not help the wit; And that might be thy case: for certainly Those salt bits I had sent thee made thee dry; Or sick, which made thee drink small drink, and strain To cast them undigested up again. Twelve lines return'd the very same, that I Must call the Hickup, rather than Reply; Or, by rebounding of my words, I dread There is some Eccho in thine empty head: Or rather thou my Cockril art, and so The young one learneth of the old to crow. Nay my brave Bird, thou darest spur and peck, I wish that Shrovetide hazard not thy neck: Now prethee Chick beware, for though I find That thou art right and of the fighting kind, Yet thou art not my Match, and soon wilt feel My Gout lies in my Toe, not in my Heel. Take this advice before you mean to fight, Get your Comb cut, and leave your treading quite. Thy Barber, or his Wife, if he should fail, Has skill to clip thy wings, and trim thy tayl; And thereby hangs another Tayl, I find Thy subtil nose hath got my breech i'th' wind. If thou canst catch poor farts that Prison break, A notable Bumbayliff thou wilt make. Hark, hark, saist thou, he let a fart! what though? It breaths forth no Sedition, Sir, I trow; Nor is there any Statute of our Nation That sayes, in five miles of a Corporation If any Outed-man a Fart should vent, That you should apprehend the Innocent. If you so soon could smell the Pouder-Plot, What had you said if I had bullets shot? Fye man! our mouths were stopped long ago, And would you have us silent too below? But I displaid my bum before thyne eyes Unkindly thou saist, I say otherwise; For there thou mightst have thy resemblance took, Dead mens blind cheeks do very wanley-look. And For the crack it gave, that did but mind thee, To strive to leave a good report behind thee. As for the gall which in your Ink appears, That in our sufferings we are Volunteers; I'le not say much, I have more wit than so, 'Tis scurvy jesting with edg-tools I know: But Sir, 'tis cruelty in you, to whip Your Brothers back which you did help to strip. Yet thus your Grandsire Levi did before, Who kil'd those, whom his Cov'nant had made sore. And you know who they were that gave the blow, And then cry'd, Prophesie who smote thee so? We durst not keep our Livings for our lives, But they must needs go whom the Devil drives. Yea but we left our Harvest, left our Sheep, And would not work in one, nor th' other keep. I answer. No great Harvest yet appears, I'm sure your Churches hang but thin with ears. And though the Foxes breed, what need you care, When-as your Shepherds such Fox-catchers are. For pardon, Sir, my serious soul now cryes, Your knocking me did make this froth to rise. Once for my Age, Profession and Degree, To fool thus is enough, and Twice for thee. Thus great Estates b'imprudent owners may, When stak'd at Ticktack, soon be plaid away. Let's wind this folly up in this last sheet, And friendly part, as we did friendly meet. Yet, to requite thy Legacy to me, Accept this Litany I send to thee. May thy rich Parts with saving Grace be joyn'd, As Diamonds in Rings of Gold enshrin'd; May he that made thy Stars, create a Sphear Of heavenly frame of life, and fix them there; May that blest Life credit Conformitie, And make e'ven Puritans to honour thee. Maist thou to Christ such store of Converts bring, That he whose place thou fill'st, for joy may sing. May God love you, and you love God again; And may these Prayers of mine not be in vain.
