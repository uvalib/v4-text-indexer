      <field name="fulltext">Upon His Maiesties Arrival at the Isle of Wight. Let Turkie boast of Empire; France of Law; Venice of Site; Gold, India; Water, Spaw. Trade and Religions, London, Amsterdam; Of Greatness Florence; or the Tartar Cam. All these concenter in one spot, one span, The Isle of Wight, and Charls the Ile of Man. A Man whose mind's above the Turkish Crest, A King who make's good Laws, and keep's them best: A Prince who like to well-built Venice stand's, In mid'st of Waters, yet in sight of Lands: Whose Roial Breast's an India, where's a Mint Of Golden thoughts; base ones were ne're coin'd in't. Whose Gift (as waters have a fame) can heal Th'Evil, Oh would it might the Common-weal! Hee trade's not in Religions; yet own's one Profest by most, Practis'd by Him, or none. Fortunate Isle! to thee ill fortune bring's If not the Greatest, yet the Best of Kings. PALÆMONIS Vaticinium Votivum. [1.] Scarce had the Summer with her dounie wing Brush't, &amp; lai'd by the Wardrope of the Spring, When Princelie Charls with his fair Train did pleas T'expose His Sacred Person to the Seas; Trusting to th'mercie of the Ocean more Then those Land-Monsters which hee left on Shore. And now great France (in greatness more increa'st,) Court's the Arrival of this stately guest; Whose coming there was onely to resign, And offer up his Sorrows at the shrine Of His dread Mother; who to make Her Moan And Mourning less, did intermix his own. Sad Queen! how hath stern step-dame Fortune tost, And bandied Thee from Britain to the Coast Of France! where Sein displaie's her silver-floods, And grand Saint German vannteth her vast woods. 2. To this calm Rendezvouz sad Charls repair's With Sports to cozen and beguil his Cares: Somtimes Hee Hunt's, and with his Vocal Horn, Summon's Aurora, and the loitering Morn: Somtimes Hee read's; and equally impart's His well-divided hours for Arms or Arts. Yet most Hee sport's in Martial Skirmishes, (W?? may b' in Earnest when just Heaven shall pleas.) Somtimes Hee plaie's at Tennis; then again Expert in Feats of Chivalrie, strive's to train The stubborn Steed; and his rough fetlocks bring Within the Cube and Compass of the Ring. But ah! these Pastims are too short and brief To flatter Sorrow, or to dandle Grief. His Cares thus crush't, obtrude; and still abuse His busie Fancie, with the whisper'd News Of good or bad Events, which still relate T'a Kingdom's Fortune, or a Father's Fate. Yet now since Heaven doth call; Hee's bent to trie The worst of Chance, and out-dare Destinie, Since the designed Time, and hovering Hours At hand to Punish those Usurping Powers; To put a Snaffle in the Head-strong-Jaws Of Hot-spur-Rebels, who have tir'd all waies: Wh' have jaded, spurgall'd Pitie; and let loos Her Reins; and made tame Mercie of no use. 3. Thus Ruminate's sad Charls, and float's betwixt Dutie and Zeal; unstable and unfix't, Touch't with the mutual Sens of th'One and Other, Of a Dear Father and Indulgent Mother; At length the Ponderous thoughts of His Sire's fate Weigh'd down the Scales, and ended the Debate. Then from the Frontiers of fair France Hee post's, And re-imbarck'd, arrive's on Belgia's Coasts; Whose Continent before Hee well survei'd Hee left, and in all haste His Anchors weigh'd, Putting to Sea; where Nereus, with a Fleet Of well-rigg'd-shipping, did his Higness greet. A gallant Navie! whose full number might Out-brave the boisterous Billows, and affright Those huge Behemoths and vast Porpoises, Which Tole the Waters and Excise the Seas. 4. These did propitious Providence provide, And pre-ordain to bee great Charls His Guide: Whose just Desertion of a ship-wrack't Caus, Buoi'd up and born by Usurpation was, Som luckie Omen of Blest Charls Success, Which made His Power grow greater, and theirs less. And thus re-ent'ring with His Roial Train, Hee plow's the fertile Furrows of the Main. And with low-bended-knees, but loftie eies Implore's high Heaven to bless his Enterpize. The Cannons clos'd th'Amen: and did inlarge Their wide-stretch't-Organs to Report the Charge: Both Rocks and Rivers trembled at the stroaks Of louder Guns; whose Center-shaking-shocks Like the Cloud-cleaving Thunder, seem'd to tear The troubled Welkin, and affright the Air. The prettie Tritons did that daie belabor Their well-tun'd-shells, which sounded like som Tabor, Whiles the whole Chore of Sea-Nymphs did advance And teach the Capering Surges how to dance. 5. Thus with His Princelie Fleet whiles Hee doth sail Near Britain's Coast, fann'd with a whispering Gale, Tridented Neptune plac't Him at the Helm, Himself doing Homage to his three-fold Realm. But poor Palæmon at His Launching plie's His task, and swell's the Canvass with his Sighs, Whose trickling tears fell down like showers of Rain, Striving to mix fresh Water with the Main. Long in these doleful dumps hee stood for lack Of his lov'd Soveraign, and at last thus spake. 6. “O Thou whose wonders are seen in the Deep “Unbottom'd Bowels of the Ocean! keep “And Crown His Sacred Highness with divine “Glories; whose Scepter is a Type of Thine. “O! let th'obseqvious windes, and waves allaie “Their surlie looks, and studie to obeie. “O! let all storms bee chain'd up in abstruse “And lonely caverns, and no more break loos, “Whiles the whole Rabble of black Tempests sleep, “Lull'd by the warbling Musick of the Deep. “Let this Daie's Jubilee with Peace bee blest “And hush't, as when Halcyon build's her nest: “Such bee that Daie when great Charls doth prepare “T'encounter with Rebellion, and repair “The Ruines of three Kingdoms, to increas “His enemies Horror, but His Subjects Peace. 7. Dread Sovereign! whose verie name give's fire To my dull Muse, which stand's but to admire; And in th'amazement of that Zeal doth greet Thy Sacred Highness with unequal Feet. Pass on in triumph with a prosperous Tide, Whiles Zephyrus is thy Pass-port and thy Guid: Hee, Hee's thy Harbinger who swiftlie clear's The Coast from Tempests when thy Pilot steer's; How doth Hee smile, and smooth His chearful brow Ballanc't with so divine a weight as Thou! The ship which wafted Jason to the shore Of Colchis, which the vulgar did adore And Deïfie so much, that they did prize Each Planck as Trophies to bee fix't ith' Skies; That Ship was but a Cock-boat to thy Sail, Or som poor punie Whiting to a Whale. Had Hee been Fraught with Thee, hee ne'r had thought Of that vain Voiage, and so dearly bought A lock of Wool, and better-tutor'd Greece, Would brag no longer of her Phrygian Fleece: Those Pageant-pot-gun-Triumphs (if their storie Were true) were but meer Atoms to Thy Glorie, W?? flame's like Heaven's bright blazing lamp through th'whole World, from th'Artick to th'Antartick Pole. 6. Goe then blest Mirror of Great Britain! go, Implore Heaven's Aid above, whiles here below Thy Subjects linger, readie with th'Expense Of their dear Blood, to fall in Thy Defence: Fresh Trophies Court Thee; richer then that old Fleece, fetch't from Phrygia, though each lock were gold: Thy Caus awake's th'whole world, and clamor's high For Vengeance, from a Supreme Deïtie. Angels and Men are mov'd; when Devils dare Intrench on Princes, and usurp the Chair Of Sovereign Power; A Fact that cannot hold Comparison; unless referr'd to th'old Unweildie Giants, threatning to unthrone Their Jove, and scale the Castles of the Sun; But as their brainless Furie was confin'd And nail'd to Ætna; so let these Youths finde The self-same Fate; whose Villanies have hurl'd Earth from her Center, and unhing'd the World. How would two Houses pull twelv 'bout their ears, Those twelv Celestial Mansions of the Spheres? Whiles Stars, nay Moon and Sun may shine alone, Since our New Lights have Lanthorns of their own. Thus have these Phaëtons fir'd, and turn'd each Town (Heart-burn't before) t'a Conflagration. Strange Babel-By-Blows! t'untile Thrones by a trick Of State, and build a Common-wealth with Brick: Dismantling Earthlie Kingdoms, to prepare Mountains i'th Moon, and Castles in the Air. 9 Then sail auspicious Prince! and wafted o're The officious Waves, review Thy Native Shore; New string thy nervless Subjects; and impart Fivers and Arteries to the Peoples heart; Resolv'd to hazard all, and to make good Thy Roial Title, sealed in their Blood. 10. And now I grow Prophetick 'bove all Fiction; And breathe Divinitie in my wish't prediction. Black Clouds dissolv, and gloomie Horror go's Back to that cursed Chaös whence shee rose. Not daring to creep nearer, or incroach, When Charls shall in bright Majestie approach. As when great Titan Charioter to the daie, Rideth his Circuit in his rich Arraie; The conscious Night retire's, and to bewail Her Guilt the more, put's on a Mourning Vail. Or look as when Sol's melting Beams pearch't high To their Meridian, how the poor Herds flie Head-long in Droves! as though they were affraid Of those pale shadows which their flight hath made! So may those Gobling Ghosts, those Beasts of Prey Sneak to their sootie Hen-roosts, and with-draw At Thy dread-looks: so may those Serpents hiss Back, countermanded to their first Abyss. Let them Repent that Daie, and Text it in Their fatal Rubrick, when they first did sin Against their Sovereign, daring to Conspire And Spawn black Treason 'gainst Thy Sacred Sire. Let them Repent, when Vengeance and Heaven too Shall paie their Score, and give them what's their Due. 11. Thus did that good Anchises son of old By th'Authentick Sybils Oracle grow bold To rescue his blest Father, and thence made A strange adventure through the Elizian shade; Such was His private Pietie, but Thy Zeal Involv's three Kingdoms and their Publick-weal: Each Act is Sacred, and each aim of Thine Center's in Heaven, and thence grow's Divine. 12. O thou great-wonder-working God above! By whom the machine of th'whole Earth doth move; Who rul'st both Sword and Scepter with a Rod, And still'st the mutinous world with thy sole nod: Inspire, inspire great Charls, and gently shed Showers of Scepters on our Sovereign's Head; That Justice may return t'arraign those known Loos Outlaries Thine enemies, and their own: That wee may injoie old Saturn's daies of old, To re-convert our Iron into Gold. With these throng'd Blessings was Thy Father Crown'd Thrice seven long Summers, leaving a Renown'd And Princelie Progenie, which shall secure This Throne as long as Sun or Stars indure. But may thy Scepter, and thy Regal Power Brook no Corrival, nor Competitor; Whiles Princes made thy Tenants, hold the Leas Both of their lives and fortunes to the Peace Of glorious Britain; and preserv'd thus, own Their selvs and safeties to Thy Roial Throne. 13. In this sad plight Palemon did implore Th'Eternal Powers, and fain would have said more, But did referr the sequel of his Praier To Heaven's great Mercie, and th'Almightie's Care: Besides Sol had unsadled (for their eas His Steeds) and drench't his Chariot in the Seas: The Fleet was out of sight too, and t'was best For poor Palemon to conceal the rest. 14. Yet since wing'd Vollies of his wishes may Wait on great Charls, as Convoies to His waie, Hee send's them wrapt in Sighs; as griev'd to shew How little hee could paie, how much must ow; But whiles hee breathe's, hee'l deprecate those dire Accursed Band-dogs that have fann'd this fire Of Civil Discords; letting loos th'unjust Reins to licentious Murther, and black Lust: Who welt'ring in their gore, have swam to th'chin In Bloodie Riot, and Seditious Sin. And here they have rais'd their Crimes by the exile Of Thy blest Presence, from this Brittish Isle. Which last Act, when their Fate grow's mellow, shall Add to their Weight, and Crush them in the fall. 15. Go then great Champion; go; make good the storie That cite's Alcides, O may Thy first glorie Bee vow'd to Mars: whiles miscreants are thence made The Maiden-handsils of thy fatal Blade. And though 'tis pittie such base Blood should stain A Roial Fauchion; and but little gain To kill such Hedg-hogs. Let not this Plea sue Their Pardons, nor debar them of their due: Since the griev'd Realm doth groan, and groan agen, Big with those Monsters, in the shape of men: Whose violent pangs, and long Convulsion-fits Have half bereft, and robb'd her of her wits. Bee Thou then her Lucina, bee, and close Her womb, expanded through her teeming-throws; And as they Brood still quell, and dissipate The abortive Hydra's of an Headless State. May Men and Angels further Thy intent In this great Work, and wait upon th'event; Since now the Season, and the appointed Times Are near to powr down vengeance on their Crimes: And th'hour's at hand (if Souldiers may divine) To seek their Ruines that have thus sought Thine. FINIS. A short Paraphrase on the fore-going Prophecie. ‘The Prophecie Of Paulus Grebnerus’ has been omitted. How well could Grebner in those Blinde Times see! And in these Seeing-Times how blinde are wee? Our new-Found-Lights are lost; those squint-ei'd-Elvs, And purblinde Seekers, may now seek themselvs; Who have thus err'd, imagining Prediction Of Sacred Prophesie, but som feigned Fiction. But wee (blest Grebner!) who have still admir'd, And look't upon thee as som Soul inspir'd; Will hold thy Saws no longer in suspens, W?? now w'have reach't with th'Opticks of our Sens; Since what was once Apocalyps, is known The unridled Truth of Revelation. Those two grand Champions (that trode on the Neck Of Nations, and had Kingdom's at Their Beck) Are both exstinct; and Fame can onely give A bare relation that They once did live. But Thou renowned Charls, whose matchless Fate Design'd Thee a Victim to the People's Hate; (Maugre the malice of Thy Foes) wert hurl'd With Haleluiahs from the wondring vvorld, A Conqueror o're Thy doom; from vvhence vvee may Infer, Thou onely liv'dst, vvee di'd that daie. And now look back; look back; and have recours From whence these streams of Mischief had their sours, Whiles those promiscuous Hodg-podg-Powers oppose, Like high-swoln Floods that River whence they rose. The Eagle thus dislodg'd; a Wren-like race Of dunghil-Dors, soon pierch't-up in His Place. And Lapwing-Libertie e're fleg'd, take's flight, First hath her Champion-Earl; the next a Knight, Whose heavie Pressure hath so imp't her wings, Shee hath lost by Consuls what shee got by Kings. And now (but life's in Prophecie) wee might Die, and despair to see Thy Second Light, Great Charls, who like the Bridegroom of the daie, Shalt gil'd sad Britain with Thy glorious Raie; Whiles all those shower-shot Mushroms, and those new Created Brats, melt like the morning dew; And all those Ignes fatui shrink and run Like Exhalations at the rising Sun. This is the Wish great King, and pious Care Of those who piece-forth Prophecie with their Praier; O may blest Grebner bee added to the Small Prophets! and prove each line Canonical; Whiles what in th'old Queen's Reign hee did divine, May bee fulfill'd, and ratifi'd in Thine: O mai'st Thou Reign in Thy known Realms, who art Inthron'd alreadie in Thy People's heart! O mai'st Thou Rule! and spread Thy Fame through th'whole Earth; from the Artick to t'Antartick Pole. Till the just world with Grebner shall maintein Thee a mightier Monarch then brave Charlemain. FINIS. To the Sacred Memorie of that late High and Mightie Monarch, Charls the First; Hee who fell Jan. 30. 1648. the Princelie Proto-Martyr of Great Britain, &amp;c. In iniquitatibus illorum Gloriam Tuam perfecisti. No more of Annals; let great Rome grow mute In quoting Catiline, or recording Brute: Britain now wear's the Sock; the Theater's clean Transplanted hither, both in Place and Scene. No Vail nor Periwig-vizor; Murther, here Without a mask dare's on the Stage appear, Out-facing even the Sun, which oft hath fled, And at less crimes shrunk in his frighted head. Rome had som Plea (though shee ne're justifi'd) Those fatal Swords by which great Cæsar di'd. But here a greater far then Cæsar fall's By a spurious Senate and her Cannibals. How do that Monster-headless-multitude Gaze on the Beams, and giddily intrude On's Sacred Person! murthering Him before The eies of Heaven! and at His own Door! A Prince so sweetly Pious, Rebels must Confess 'tis they were guiltie, but Hee Just! And now behold the Scene! White-hall's decreed The fatal shambles where the Lamb must bleed; White-hall! from whence Hee oft dispers'd and hurl'd His Sacred Oracles through the Peaceful world: There with an uncontrolled Courage, (higher Far then that Scaffold) did His Soul asspire In glorious Elohims, making His last state His Haleluiah, or Magnificat. Thus Great Augustus falling, did bequeath New Edicts to the world, even at His Death, Such as did Screen His Memorie from the rust Of black Oblivion; and embalm His Dust. But Thou blest Charls, whom Historie shall stile The Princelie Proto-Martyr of this Isle. Fell'st Champion of the Church; and did'st make good The Realms grand Charter sealed in Thy Blood. And could this dismal shock of Thunder light Onely on Britain's breast? and not affright The Univers? to let us understand, The general Dooms-daie of the world's at hand? Children unborn shall still bewail the time Of this sad Hour; and deprecate the Crime Of those dire Regicides, whose blushing guilt, For Vengeance crie's loud as that Blood th'have spilt. Thy Caus invoke's just Heaven, and doth implore Confederate Princes to the farthest Shore Of all the world; as far as Phœbus raie Doth guild the Zodiack, and proclaim's the daie. And yet should all these fail; Blest Charls 'tis known Thou'st left a Princelie Progenie of Thine own. Who'l expiate Thy Murther, or resign Their own Lives too, as Offerings at Thy Shrine. And now see! see! another Phenix rise! From the blest ashes of this Sacrifice! A Second Charls! who shall in fame asspire, And grow more Mightie then His Princelie Sire. And now, O may th'unanimous world inthrone Him soon! and re-invest Him in His Own. May Hee out-live old Nestor's daie and go Not hence, but cloathed in a Robe of Snow; And then when envious Heaven too shall remove His Swaie from Earth, O may Hee Reign above! And meet His Sire, wh' (having past this flood In Robes of scarlet di'd in His own Blood) Sit's now a Crowned Martyr, and hath free Title to add a Fourth Crown to His Three. Memoriæ Sacrum Optimi Maximi CAROLII. Great Sir, Your pardon that my ruder Vers Dare's with her Feet profane Your Sacred Hers; True Grief no Manners know's; and to begin With Courtship, were but ceremonious sin. Whiles You surviv'd, blest Sir, my Loial breath Still waited on Your Service; and since Death (Sent by the Actors of so black a Treason, As puzzles Faith, and quite confounds all Reason) Hath hurl'd You hence; You justly Sir may call My Bodied thoughts to wait Your Funeral. My dwindling-dwarf-like-Fancie swell's not big, Nor know's to wear a borrowed Periwig Of Metaphors, nor from Parnassus rise To ransack far-fetch't Phrases from the Skies; Since all those pidling Epithites are too brief, Great Charls, to shew Thy Glorie, or my Grief. Go thou grim Conqueror; search thy kingdom through, Examine everie Urn and Pitcher too; Taste all thy Earths, and call at everie Grot, Even those whose Names, Rust &amp; the Worms have got; And tell mee if in all thy Dark-hous bee Such a Prince faln, and Prince though faln, as Hee. Greatness and Goodness too, which seldom fall Within the Compass of the self-same Scale, In Him were poized, and divinely met; Whose Meekness made Him Good, and Mercie Great. His Meekness, oh! that inexhausted Mine And Magazine of Moral and Divine Graces, which like the influence, and the bright Beams of the Sun, fill'd Britain with their Light. But why am I thus partial? when that all His Thoughts, Words, Actions, were Angelical? Which like fix't Load-stars, did direct most men To sail by th'Compass of His Life and Pen: Each pious action was so chaste, and such As held it sin to think, but death to touch; His Mercie such, as if Hee did but live To know His Subjects failings, and forgive. Unheard of Love! which could offences mask And sooner grant their Pardon, then they ask! Thus was His Life un-pattern'd! but His Death! Oh how the sens which suffocate's my breath Curdle's my blood! and, like swift poison, flie's, In curling flames through all my Arteries! Hee di'd by th'barbarous hands of such a Frie As fed on Furies, and have dreined Drie The Lerna of all Murthers, to new-stock Mankinde with spreading Crimes; such as may mock Preceding Treasons, and the world supplie With a strange Mould to cast all Future by: All former Acts were fictions unto this; Raviliacks too is a Parenthesis; A Murther so transcendent, Annals shall Henceforth grow faithless and Apochryphal. But Thou blest Martyr, who hast here laid down, And chang'd a Temporal for a Glorious Crown; Hast finish't Thy great Work, and by th'event, Attain'd more then they promis'd, but ne'r meant. Rest Royal Sir, rest in Your Sacred Hers While wee embalm Your Memorie with our Vers, And trickling Tears, which shall like Pearls refine Your Urn, and serv for Diamonds to your Shrine. You need no other Monument, who have No less then three whole Kingdoms for Your Grave: Whiles from the melting Marble of their Eies Is Crystalliz'd this Epitaph Here lie's “Honor's rich Fountain, the True Faith's Defender; “Religion, and the Law's Prop, and Extender; “The purest quintessence of Christian Zeal, “Best Father both of Church and Common-weal! “Virtues rare Patern; Wedlocks chastest Mirror; “Rebellions and bold Treasons, Scorn and Terror; “The spotless Sacrifice, for the wilde flood “Of's People's loud sins. Charls the Great, the Good. CHRONOSTICHON Decollationis Caroli Regis, &amp;c. tricesimo die Januarii, secunda hora Pomeridiana, Anno Dom. MDCXLVIII. Ter Deno IanI Labens ReX SoLe CaDente CaroLVs eXVtVs SoLIo SCeptróqVe SeCVre. Charls!—ah forbear, forbear! lest Mortals prize His Name too dearly; and Idolatrize. His Name! Our Loss! Thrice cursed and forlorn Bee that Black Night, which usher'd in this Morn. Charls our Dread Sovereign!—hold! lest Out-law'd Sens Bribe, and seduce tame Reason to dispens With those Celestial Powers; and distrust Heaven can Behold such Treason, and prove Just. Charls our Dread Sovereign's murther'd!—Tremble! and View what Convulsions Shoulder-shake this Land; Court, Citie, Countrie, nay three Kingdoms run To their last Stage, and Set with Him their Sun. Charls our Dread Sovereign's Murther'd at His Gate! Fell Fiends! dire Hydra's of a Stiff-neck't-State! Strange Bodie-Politick! whose Members spread, And, Monster-like, swell bigger then their Head. Charls of Great Britain! Hee! who was the known King of three Realms, lie's murther'd in His Own. Hee! Hee! who liv'd, and Faith's Defender stood; Die'd here to re-Baptize it in His Blood. No more, no more. Fame's Trump shall Eccho all The Rest in dreadful Thunder. Such a Fall Great Christendom ne're Pattern'd; and 'twas strange Earth's Center reel'd not at this dismal Change. The Blow struck Britain blinde, each well-set Limb By Dislocation was lop't off in Him. And if Shee yet live's, Shee live's but to condole Three Bleeding Bodies left without a Soul. Religion put's on Black. Sad Loialtie Blushe's and Mourn's to see bright Majestie Butcher'd by such Assassinates; nay both 'Gainst God, 'gainst Law, Allegiance, and their Oath. Farewel sad Isle! Farewel! Thy fatal Glorie Is Summ'd, Cast up, and Cancell'd in this Storie. FINIS. OBSEQUIES ON That unexemplar Champion of Chivalrie, and Pattern of true Prowess, Arthur Lord Capel. T'is fals Astronomie.—Nor are wee yet In utter darkness, though the Sun bee set; Since Thy star-beaming-influence prove's all Those Rules Excentrick, and Apocryphal. Thou'rt hight'ned by Thy Fall, and dost now shine With doubled lustre, since Thy last Decline. Bright mirror of our Sphere! who art no less Then Valor's wonder; Virtue's Master-piece; Filling whole Volums with Thy Fame; to tell The World Thy Worth was her own Chronicle: To tell the World, those Praises in the Wars Thou'st purchas'd, might bee numbred with the Stars; And had Thy well-proportion'd-Daies been Spun Out by Thy Deeds, Thou had'st out-liv'd the Sun; Forcing the World's great Luminarie t'have His Chaös climacterick with Thy Grave. Thus Thy renowned Meeds like Incens hurl'd On flaming Altars, have Perfum'd the World With such rich Odors, that scarce Envie knew Whether Thou wer't to King or Realm most true. Let State-Chronographers admire, and plead Those Rites they ow to Honor; when they read Thy rare Atchievements; studying to refine The truth of Modern Historie by Thine. Carthage bee dumb! our Colchester stand's now Corrival with thee, and dare's more then Thou; And all those Punick Wars, thy Walls could boast, Have o're and o're been travers'd on her Coast. Rome's three Horatii are pos'd; our Isle Hath bred a Capel, Lucas, and a Lisle: Whose matchless deed's have Dub'd them with that late And glorious title of Triumvirate; Whiles their transcendent merit strut's, and strive's To stand on tip-toe in Superlatives. And still there's somthing more; for, what was mixt Promiscuously in these, in Thee was fixt. In Thee that Pythagorean Maxime's true; And what was stale Philosophie, prove's new Divinitie, since th'Souls of all those Nine Renowned Ones Transmigrated in Thine. But why do wee Adore Thee, made immens And far sublim'd above our Sphere of Sens? Scorning bright Obelisques of Brass, or Stone Should rais Thy Monument, who art Thine own. Yet should'st Thou exspect a Shrine on Earth, wee must Make Colchester th'Exchequer of Thy Dust: Nor is it more then reason, since 'twere pitie To give Thee a less Church-yard then that Citie, T'Interr Thee in her Breaches, and o're-turn Her stately Bulwarks, to support Thine Urn; Whil'st the throng'd streets would justle to make room And spread their Towrs, as Trophies o're Thy Tomb. But this grand Task I recommend to those, Who can limm Fancies in more lively Prose; Whose Rhetorick may richly guild this Pile, And rais Invention to a loftie stile; Such as may Conjure Horror, and oblige Faith-founder'd-Zelots to confess that Siege, That fatal Siege, whose Trenches were or'e-spread With mangled trunks and bodies of the Dead; Till the discolour'd Earth, thus di'd in Grain, Blush't to behold such Shambles of the Slain: And the pale Furies stood like heartless Elvs, Trembling, to see Men do more then Themselvs. The Center-shaking-Brass grew hot, and spoke In Flames of Lightning, and in Clouds of Smoke; And Charon fainted, Ferrying Souls to Hell, When Hecatombs of the Besiegers fell. Amidst these Tragick Triumphs did'st Thou rear Thy brave Top-gallant, 'bove the reach of Fear; Undauntedly exposing Thy bold Head To shocks of Thunder, and thick showrs of Lead: Those Bullets were then Tame; and wee may tax The partial Sword that spar'd Thee for the Ax. The Field (th'Asylum of great Spirits) clean Is changed here; the Citie is the Scene; The Cannon shew'd fair-plaie: But Thou wer't pack't Away, not by an Ordnance, but an Act. The Scaffold turn'd a Stage: Where 'tis confest, The last Act (though most Bloodie) prov'd Thy Best: It prov'd Thy solemn Coronation, since The Yard's Thy Palace; and a Glorious Prince Thy President: Who after Him art hurl'd To meet Thy Sovereign in another World. Transferr'd from Earth to Heaven, to remain A fixed Star, and wait on Charls his Wain. OBSEQUIES Offered up to the Memorie of the ever Renowned and never to bee forgotten, Arthur, Lord Capel. Do; paddle still in Blood, for 'tis not strange Now if your thirstie dropsi'd Blades do range On the whole stock of Man; or that they spread To Trunck and Boughs, since they have lop't the Head: For since the King, who like one general Soul, Did through each nerv and agile muscle rowl; And like som publick Conduit did dispence To everie Vein, both Sap and Influence; Shine's in His Crown of Martydom above, Guilt and enamel'd with the Beams of Love; The Cement thus unfix't and slack't, wee must Needs languish in to shuffled heaps of Dust: And as in Bodies, where the Head is lop't From off the weeping Stem, som Spirits drop't From that great Magazine, into each part, And left as Legacies unto the Heart; Contract the Joints and Hands, then make them spread As if they catch't at the dislodging Head; So after this vast Ruin, though the Frame Of Nature were both discompos'd and lame; Yet in this crippled Structure, there might bee Som starts and leaps, w?? flow'd (brave Lord!) from Thee; On whom, as som not yet discovered Sours, Which doth to th'suppled Earth fresh Sap disburs, And through her veins melt's in a purling rill, Th'expiring King His Vigor did distil. And as som sullen Vapor which was spun From th'Earth's cours Wardrobe, by the glaring Sun, To som wilde Meteors, hover's in the Air, And on each Cloud shed's its unravel'd hair; But wanting Active Heat to waft it higher, Doth in dull Slime and sluggish Mists exspire: So before Capel was (like th'early Flower Which ruder Hands tore from the mangled Bower) Rent from His Bleeding stalk, wee might perchance, Like vapors wing'd with His brave heat, advance Above the Common-level, yet but now His Flames shot-up no new Supplie t'allow. Wee crumble shall to Ruin streight, and run Into a wilde Precipitation. And as when Morning from the Azure Towers Powr's out the daie, and pluck's out th'unfledg'd hours; The Earth unlock's its womb, each flower unweav's Its odorous tresses, and untie's its leavs, That so they may bee spangled by that blaze That from the blooming Sun's gilt lustre strai's; So now vvhen Hee like a nevv-budded Star That stud's the Orb's above, doth from a far Point out his Beams to us, let their clear Light Steer us through the perplexed maze of night; And our benum'd and frozen Souls so thavv, Hee may both our Example bee and Lavv; For though that Man's a vvorld vvithin himself; In Him no Passion svvell'd into a Shelf To split His even thoughts, no Rock of Pride Did intercept or justle the free Tide Of vvell-poiz'd actions, and no Mountain there Was by Ambition made, or Gulf by Fear. His beauteous Actions too vvithout did meet, Still in such comlie and vvell-ballanc't feet, And vvere so fairly knit, you'd think they'd been Each one the Transcript of His Soul within; No Byas His Religion vvarp't avvrie Into a crooked Excentricitie, 'Tvvas sullied vvith no Ends; Hee could not tell Hovv to vamp Calvin vvith dark Machiavel. No Widdovvs cooler sighs did fan His Cup, Hee drank in's Wine no Tears of Orphans up; His Pregnant Fields vvere moist'ned by the Skies, Not vvet vvith shovvers rain'd from His Tenants eies; And having thus vvith Virtue pav'd the Track Which to His Urn did guid His foot-steps back; Hee, vvhen His full-fledg'd Soul cast off her Claie, To bathe in Tides of never-ebbing daie, Did in so soft a Calm dismiss His breath, As if 't vvere His Espousals, not His Death; And that in His cold shroud Hee vvere to meet The Portraict onely of His Genial sheet. OBSEQUIES On the untimely Death, of the never to bee too much praised and pitied Francis Lord Villiers. Hence fond Philosophie! it cannot bee; The crazie World crawl's t'his last Jubilee; And though the Circle of the Year hath been A Snake in embleme, it can't cast his skin. At least I can't beleev't; when everie daie, Som stately piece is swallowed up in claie; When Cedars feel the fate of Shrubs, and when Great Peers expire, and tamely die like men. How could'st Thou els thus steal away unheard, Without a Troop of Angels for thy guard? Without th'Artillerie of the Clouds, at this Thy great and glorious Metempsycosis? The Age is sure forgetful; or perchance Nature Her self laie Bed-rid in a Trance, And those Torch-Constellations which shine At others Herses, were all set in Thine; As if they fell with Thee, and Fate would have Their Chaös clymacterick with Thy Grave. But, why do I epitomize a Theme In this small Scedule which deserv's a Ream? A Theme whose charming Magick might inspire A cold Carthusian; and with Enthean fire Kindle such raptures, as may re-ingage Those Buskin-Bonaerges of our Age To Personate Thee with more lively tread, And in loud language shew the world who's dead. Let brave Bellona, who hath lately known Thy Meeds, proclaim them; and with War-like tone, High as the sulphur-breathing-Brass, inlarge Thy spreading triumphs, and report her charge; Shee, Shee shall rear Thy Trophies, and displaie Thy matchless Chivalrie, on that black daie Thou copd'st with Destinie, and did'st resign Thy Temporal-Title, for a more Divine. Nor could Thy Courage stop, or make a paus, Where Honor call'd so loud; and such a Caus As might provoke an Hermit, and make room With His own Flame to meet His Martyrdom. Armed with these resolvs, encountring Fear Thou foild'st her quite, whil'st in a brave career Thou did'st out-dare the Destinies, and tread A loftie measure through whole showres of Lead; (Spight of the furie of th'opposing croud) Cleaving Thy waie, like Lightning, through a Cloud. Thus mid'st these tragick Triumphs wer't Thou hurl'd With loud Field-Musick from th'affrighted world, A Conqueror o're Thy doom; witness that Peal And vocal Vollie which chim'd forth Thy Knell; To tell the world Thy Merit, maugre Fate Still, still survive's, and is Invulnerate. How large the storie, or how ample; wee'l Not now remember, since 'twas writ with steel And register'd in Blood. Th'indented Face (Though no great Volume) was the Common-Place, And Index of Thy Valor: everie scar Seeming at least som mistick Character; While's wee admire those Marginal Notes, and vext, Wee cannot Comment on so deep a Text. But why do I revolv the short-writ-storie Of fading Youth; or recollect the Glorie Of Thy blest Beautie (which though once the Throne Oth' Lillie and Rose) was blasted before blown? Prepo'strous Fate! t'anticipate and bring On Winter e're Thou did'st enjoie Thy Spring! To obnubilate Thy Morning-Sun, and shroud Thy dawning splendor in a gloomie Cloud! But ah! Complaints are shadows, and too brief To shew the world Thy Goodness or our Grief; Nor can wee circumscribe, or with weak sens Define Thy Merit, which is so immens. Alas! wee knew 't was not the Cob-web-shrine Of Flesh could lodg so bright a Soul as Thine; T'was not a Cabinet of Claie could hold So rich a Jewel; nor the brittle Mould Of Earth contain a Seraphin, in all His blest dimensions so Angelical. Why should wee fondly then repine; or why Thus pitie Him, wee rather should envie? His state transcend's our Passions; nor may wee Revers or Counterman'd Heav'ns grand Decree: Though Wee could weep a deluge to ingross Our Griefs, and make them ample as His Loss. And You blest Madam (mirror of Your Sex, And wonder of our Age) surceas to vex Your Soul w?? sad Remembrance; whiles You smother And burie quick all Comforts in a Brother. Those Diamond-Tears You daily shed (of more Account then all those on the Indian shore) Are spent in vain; and You profusely prize His loss, to waste the Treasure of Your eies. His Fame require's no Monumental-stone, Nor Epitaph; why should You then bemoan His Funeral-Obsequies, and thus make room Ith' Tablet of Your Heart, t'erect His Tomb, Where You, blest Votaress, piously resign Your Sighs, as Incens, offer'd at His Shrine. Whil'st in the Torrent of these Tears You swim; Madam, You do bewail Your Self, not Him Who soar's above Your Sorrows; and sit's in Commission, with som blest Cherubin, Inthron'd in those Celestial Mansions, where Hee shine's like Heaven's bright Champion, in His Sphere On the Martyrdom Of His Late MAJESTIE, &amp;c. Com, com, let's Mourn; all eies, that see this Daie, Melt into Showrs, and Weep your selvs awaie: O that each Private head could yield a Flood Of Tears, whil'st Britain's Head stream's out His Blood; Could wee paie what His Sacred Drops might claim, The World must needs bee drowned once again. Hands cannot write for Trembling; let our Eie Supplie the Quill, and shed an Elegie. Tongues cannot speak; this Grief know's no such vent, Nothing, but Silence, can bee Eloquent. Words are not here significant; in This Our Sighs, our Groans bear all the Emphasis. Dread Sir! What shall wee saie? Hyperbole Is not a Figure, when it speak's of Thee: Thy Book is our best Language; what to this Shall e're bee added, is Thy Meiösis: Thy Name's a Text too hard for us: no men Can write of it, without Thy Parts and Pen. Thy Prisons, Scorns, Reproach, and Povertie (Though these were thought too courteous Injurie) How could'st Thou bear? Thou Meeker Moses, how? Was ever Lion bit with Whelps till now And did not roar? Thou England's David, how Did Shimei's Tongue not move Thee? Where's the Man? Where is the King? Charls is all Christian. Thou never wanted'st Subjects, no; when they Rebell'd, Thou mad'st Thy Passions to obeie. Had'st Thou regain'd Thy Throne of State by Power, Thou had'st not then been more a Conqueror. But Thou, thine own Soul's Monarch, art above Revenge and Anger, Can'st Thou tame Thy Love? How could'st Thou bear Thy Queen's Divorce? must Shee At once Thy Wife, and yet Thy Widdow bee? Where are Thy tender Babes once Princely bred, Thy choicest Jewels, are They Sequestred? Where are Thy Nobles? Lo, in stead of these Base savage Villains, and Thine Enemies: Egyptian Plague! 'twas onely Pharaoh's doom, To see such Vermin in His Lodging-room. What Guards are set, what Watches do they keep? They do not think Thee safe, though lock't in Sleep. Would they confine Thy Dreams within to dwell, Nor let Thy Fancie pass their Centinel? Are Thy Devotions dangerous? Or do Thy Praiers want a Guard? These faultie too? Varlets, 't was onely, when they spake for You. But lo a Charge is drawn, a Daie is set, The silent Lamb is brought, the Wolves are met. Law is arraign'd of Treason, Peace of War, And Justice stand's a Prisoner at the Bar. This Scene was like the Passion-Tragedie, His Saviour's Person none could Act, but Hee. Behold what Scribes were here, what Pharisees! What bands of Souldiers! What fals witnesses! Here was a Priest, and that a Chief one; who Durst strike at God, and His Vicegerent too. Here Bradshaw, Pilate there: This make's them twain, Pilate for Fear, Bradshaw condemn'd for Gain. Wretch! could'st not thou bee rich, till Charls was dead? Thou might'st have took the Crown, yet spar'd the Head. Th'hast justifi'd that Roman Judg; Hee stood And washt in Water, thou hast dipt in Blood. And where's the Slaughter-Hous? White-hall must bee, Lately His Palace, now His Calvarie. Great Charls, is this Thy Dying-place? And where Thou wer't our King, art Thou our Martyr there? Thence, thence Thy Soul took flight; and there will wee Not ceas to Mourn, where Thou did'st ceas to Bee. And thus, blest Soul, Hee's gon: a Star, whose fall, As no Eclips prove's Oecumenical. That Wretch had skill to sin, whose Hand did know How to behead three Kingdoms at one blow. England hath lost the Influence of Her King, No wonder that so backward was Her Spring. O dismal Daie! but yet how quickly gon? It must bee short, Our Sun went down at Noon. And now, yee Senators, is this the Thing So oft declar'd; Is this your Glorious King? Did you by Oaths your God, and Countrie mock, Pretend a Crown, and yet prepare a Block? Did you, that swore you'd Mount Charls higher yet, Intend the Scaffold for His Olivet? Was this, Hail Master? Did you bow the knee That you might murder Him with Loialtie? Alas! two Deaths! what Crueltie was this? The Ax design'd, you might have spar'd the Kiss. London, did'st thou Thy Prince's Life betraie? What? could thy Sables vent no other waie? Or els did'st thou bemoan His Cross? then, ah! Why would'st thou bee the cursed Golgotha? Thou once hadst Men, Plate, Arms, a Treasurie To binde thy King, and hast thou none to free? Dull beast! thou should'st, before thy Head did fall, Have had at least thy Spirits Animal. Did You, Yee Nobles, envie Charls His Crown? Jove beeing fal'n the Punie-gods must down: Your Raies of Honor are eclip'st in Night, The Sun is set, from whence You drew your Light. Religion Vail's her self; and Mourn's that shee Is forc'd to own such horrid Villanie. The Church and State do shake; that Building must Exspect to fall, whose Prop is turn'd to Dust. But ceas from Tears. Charls is most blest of men; A God on Earth, more then a Saint in Heav'n.</field>
