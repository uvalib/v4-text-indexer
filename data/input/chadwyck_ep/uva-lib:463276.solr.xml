      <field name="fulltext">His auncestors by vertue did This noble shield obtaine: The bearers honorable workes Through Christendome doth raigne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF THE LIFE, DEATH, AND DEVINE VERTUES, OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE FRANCIS, EARLE OF BEDFORDE, BARON RUSSELL, &amp;c. [1] Sage Socrates, once axed what was Fame Renowne, (quoth he) which overliveth life: The hope whereof the Romaines did inflame In such whote wise, as many times was strife Who first should run on Fortune's murth'ring knife; Contemning life, by wilfull losse of breath, If countrie's cause, or honour, off'red death. [2] Let Curtius be example for the rest; A gapinge gulfe who chose to be his hearse; Desire of fame so burned in his brest: The Macedon, that through the world did pearce, Reading Achilles' fame in Homer's verse, Forthwith did wish, his noble actes to spread, Homer alive, and Alexander dead. [3] And, truth to saye, man's life is but a breath; His pompe, his pride—a blast, a blase, a shower; Thrawle to disgrace, envie, suspect, and death: Even now aloft, and downe, if Fortune lowre; And therefore tearm'd, and rightly tearm'd, a flower. But, malgre these, the vertuous Fame doth crowne, When shallow graves the multitude doth drowne. 4 My Muse is bound, by seruice, zeale, and loue, The spight of death, and fortune here to showe: The Sire, &amp; Sonne, whose soules are crownd aboue, With ethers corse, posses the earth below, Untill the daye of Christe his glorious showe. By natures corse, the one bereft of breath, By fortunes spight, the other brought to death. 5 First of the first, that Earle of Bedford hight. A gratious Lord, as euer liu'd on earth. A Counseller, and of the Garter knight. Right honorable, in vertue, lore, and birth. Image of Grace, and goodnes here on earth, Whose life may be a Mirrour for the best, Whose death (nay life) proclaimes his soule at rest. 6 The Order of the Romaine funerals, to be attired, withall his honors.His purple robe doth show his honor sound, His armed sword, the metle of his hart: His forward leg, in S. Georges Garter bound. A token is of courage and desart. His Counselers place, to valour ioyneth Art. His loyall truth, aboue the rest doth shine, His Godly zeale, may well be cal'd deuine. 7 Ill men are not lamented being dead.His mourners clothd, in harts as sad as weedes, His vertues blasd, for few bad men bemone. Among the rest, his charitable deedes, with his sweete soule, to Abrahms brest are flone. He was a liberall Comforter of the poore.The poore dismayd, crye out that he is gone, Whose sights and teares, their eyes do scald or blind, as men past hope, his like againe to finde. 8 But to discribe, this gratious Lord at large, His birth, life, death, his gifts and godly feare: For Homers pen, or Virgils ware a charge, Whose vertues firme, beseemes the noble peere, (As Honors Grace) within his brest to beare. His perfect life, the best devines might teach, What workes become, the holy words they preach. 9 First, of his birth (which in his actes appeare) His Ancestors were Lords of the manner of Barwicke, in Dorcetshire. By oft decents, a Gentleman he was: Ten worthy Squiers, the Russels Armes did beare. To Knights likewise, decended of the race. And through desart (which hath the hyest place) His noble Sire, (in Henries eye a pearle) H. 8. Clim'de by degrees, vntill he was an Earle. 10 Eight Cotes he bare, which hereditare were, The Russels first, of all men knowne his owne. 1 Delatowres the next, a Westerne heire, 2 Muschamp the third, a Northerne Baron knowne. 3 Dorceth. Herringham the fourth, a neighbour of his owne. 4 Frewxmer the fift, from Worcetshire, which came. 5 Wise was the sixt, in Devonshire long of name. 6 11 Deriu'd from Truth, and lawfull Pedigrewe, These former six, his noble Father bare. The other too, were to his Mother dewe. Sabcote she hight, Inheritrix and heire. 7 With Saint Marke ioynde, both in Northampton shire. 8 Long thus he was (as I haue sayd before) A Gentleman, and Cæsar was no more. 12 And sith his howse is built of Honer now, You well shall see, the ground worke to be sound: Aduaunce (I graunt, to weake desart may bow, And weaker Grace, the building may confound. But this strong Forte, is raisde on noe, such ground, The noble Lord, first Earle of all his race, The ground-worke layde, by Vallor, lore, and Grace. 13 His noble fathers vertues and dignities By H. 8.He did not mount, as some men with a starte: Vallor him prou'd, a Scevola to be, Baronde he was, on tryall for desarte. Through wisedome then, he climed by degree. King Henries eyes, did iudge, as well as see, Who with these roomes, and Garter did him staule Lord Preauy zeale, and eke Lord Admirall. 14 He was created Earle of Bedford by F. 6. His saying: Sans l'ayde de Dieu, le ne puis. Edward the sixt, of Christendome the pearle, For seruice great, and loyalty vnstainde: Created him, of Bedford then the Earle. Who still confest, these gifts, by God he gainde, And blest of God, his vertues all remainde. (as ioynde vnto, the honnor he begonne) Unto this Lord, the noble Earle his sonne. 15 Gods wisedome oft, euen from the Iawes of death. Saues those whome he, to worthy charges caule. Throwne in the deepe, he gaue to Moyses breath. He was in mortall peril of drowning, and yet preserued.At Lycaonia Stonde, he did reuiue S. Paule. That there escapes, might c?fort thraules, in thraule, To shew his strength, and for a thousands good, The Lord (this Lord) preserued in the flood. 16 In tender yeares, where one Instruction might, Grafte lore and grace, which make the noble shine: His vertues blasde, so cleare in all mens sight. As by the same, a number did deuine. His seruice in King Henry 8. dayes. His Father being a generall, he had chardge at Muttrill, wh? he was but 18 yeares of age. His most valiant seruice in suppressing the Western Rebels, in King Edward the .6 dayes. What frutes would grow vp? those bloomes in fine At eighteene years, when youth would w?der far, This Lord was stayd, &amp; tooke a chardge in war. 17 The West doth know, the valour of his hart, The Rebels strong, he nobly did dismaye. The people since, haue honord his desart. His Syre (and he) did bring them to obaye. And euer since, haue kept them at that staye. His deeds were knowne, by Iustice, Trueth, &amp; zeale, To God, his Prince, and to the Common Weale. 18 His holy zeale, he builded on Gods word, In all his pompe the Pope he did defie. He was alwayes a most godly Protestant. The bishops in Queene Maries dayes narrowly searched him, Vide acti &amp; monum. When Mary rain'de, and bishops rul'de the sworde. To cut him short, who all his Acts did eye. A godly feare, his loyall truth did trye. His seruice then, and hye regard therefore, Doth Papists teach, their Princes to adore. 19 Yet, eare I showe his seruice vnconstrain'de, I neede must showe how hardly he was vsde. A Prisoner with the Lord Rich he remain'de. Till papists had, his actions all pervsde. He was Prisoner with the old L. Rich in Queene Maries dayes. Which fauteles were, but he reuenge refusde. He layd his wrong, not to his Countries chardge But heaping trueth, did sheild her with his tearge. 20 His seruice in Queene Maries dayes at S. Quintes, at his owne charge. Queene Mary made him Lieutenant of the West Countries.Well armed with a stout and loyall hart, At S. Quintins, he seru'd with proper charge: There needs no trompe, to sounde his hye desart. Truth bydes the push, vnarm'd, with shield or targe Malgre his foes, his merits were so large, As that the Queene esteemde him with the best, And made him then, lieutenant of the West. 21 The trust was great, but far more great his trueth, Yet he profest the faith he did before: When as he saw, the Clergie voyde of ruth: The tyranny of the papists in Queene Maries dayes.When in their rage, they seamde a Forest Bore. And Christians blood, they dronke vp more &amp; more. He grieu'd to liue, where as such Tyrants rainde: Yet loyally this bitter Crosse sustainde. 22 To trauell then his noble minde was set. He was most honorably entertained by forraine Princes.(Which knowledge sought, to do his Co?trey good) Abroade his port, such noble praise did get, As Princes when his fame they vnderstood. They honord him by all the meanes they could. God did him shield, in spight of all his foes, And yet he liu'de, vnder the Pope his nose. 23 Abroade he did not as our papistes doe, Disposition of english fugitiues.In practise ioyne, their Countrey to confownde: Although his Queene, were to gods word a foe. He neuer wrought, that she should be vncrownd, No, no, his faith, and honour both were sound. Tyranny, no warrant to rebell.Who oft had read, and did regard it well, That Tyrants were, no warrants to rebell. 24 No: Tyrants are the scourges of Gods Ire Sent from aboue, to chasten sinne below: But as the Rod, the father throwes in fire. If in his sonne, he sees that grace doth grow, The soueraigne God, with Tyrants dealeth soe: The short raignes of Tyrants. Their rules are short, and long his mercies raigne, When as he sees that we our sinnes refraine. 25 England doth know, my censure to be iust, When God from heauen, our patient bondage eide: Example by England. The Papists hope, he soone consumde to dust: Queene Mary dy'de euen in their whottest pride, Then downe did fall, their pompe of evry side. Queene Elizabeth. The Image then of Plenty, Power, and Peace, His mercy sent, whose raigne, the same encrease. 26 This noble Lord, vpon this blessed chaunce, He was the first that was sworne of Queene Elizabethes Counsell. In Counsell sate among the grauest Wights, His care was set the Gospell to aduaunce, His zeale out shinde, the Papists taper lights. To do good deedes, were set his whole delights. His noble howse of Conscience seemd a Court, Such heapes of men for succour did resort. 27 While fortune smilde, he did not like the world. Bye, bild, scrach, craue, &amp; gape are gaine could fall. His great zeale to advaunce the Gospell. Behinde his backe, these worldly Ioyes he whurld. He fixt his eyes vpon Gods Church in thrall. Which he too free, set hand, hart, purse and all. Hee made high account of good preachers. His bordes were spred, his gates wyde open stoode, For Pastors pure, which ministred heauenly foodee. 28 The Idle Droane, the forme that onely had, Hee litle passed of dum Preachers.He thought vnmeete, to take a holy charge: But some saye, though the minister be bad, Gods word is pure: which we must make our targe. I say no les, and yet they roue at large. A Diamond keepes his vertue set in bras, But set in Gold, it hath a perfect grace, 29 Gods word is pure, though preached by the Deuil. The holy Ghoste, yet seldome comes in hell: Without whose gift, mans nature is most euill. Much like a foole, that bytes the bitter shell, And leaues the nut, the barke, not tasting well. The multitude, of perfect iudgement barde, The Preachers words, so by his life regard. 30 This noble Lord, this grocenes did perceiue, That simple men Iudge by the outward face: And therefore did his benefices giue To such as had, both learning, gift and grace. Would God the like, ware seene in eury place. The God of Heauen should be glorified then, Euen, by the workes, the liues, and lights of men. 31 Although this Lord, was honord by the sword. [illeg.]His wisedome iudg, d that learning was deuine. Which to aduaunce, his bounty did afford. Allowance great, as if he had a mine. To Schollers poore, in whome good gifts did shine. In mournfull Cryes, he both his eares bestowde. His purse wide ope, a fruitefull pitty showde. 32 To show he bilt his acttions of the Lord, Not as the most, on fortunes smiling cheare: Hes poesie applied to Gods power ouer all actions. He chose Che sera, sera, for his word. Gods will shalbe, in heauen aboue and heare. The Thunder bolte, the strongest towres teare. The lightning flash consumes the house of reede, And plagues do raigne, vpon the wicked seede. 33 What did become, of Cæsars clyming head Antipater was driu? by a subtill pollicie to get Alexanders body buried. Of Pompeis rule, and Alexanders raigne A light account, so soone as they were dead, Yea they whose mindes, a world could not c?taine, With much a doe: a seemely Tombe did gaine. Their conquestes great, returnde and waxed lesse, For nought may stand, but what gods h?d doth bles. 34 The Plow in vaine, is set into the ground, Unlesse the seede, God blesseth with encrease: The bilding of the wicked is vnsound: Although of bras he frameth euery peace. Yea sinketh oft, before his owne disseace. This Prouerbe old, doth profecie his fall. Though man propose, yet God disposeth all. 35 This noble Lord, that hath both seene and read, The Rules and Raignes, y? Time, did sinke &amp; shake. That euen those men, that fortune most had fead. That liu'de like Gods, their leaues as m? did take. And haue no name, of whom ten thousands spake. By his Poesie, in true construction then: Gods power showes, ore all the works of men. 36 And that the Lord, might all his labours blesse, His chiefest workes, his temple was to bilde, To comfort those, that languisht in distresse, Such to receiue, as Tyranny exilde. To cloth, and feade, the widdow and her childe. On these good deedes, which holy men may name. This Godly Lord, did build his forte of fame. 37 The glory that Cæsar esteemed. Cæsar oft sayd, he gloried most in this, Vnto his friend, he neuer was vnkinde: And oft forgaue, his foe that did amis, Two worthy gifts beseeming Cæsars minde, Which in this lord, his vertues brightly shinde: His bounty and mercy very great.For to his friend, none could more fauour show. Nor none that liu'd that more forgaue his foe. 38 This gratefull part, though many I could show, Among the rest, a good remembraunce: Gods will this Lord into the Theames did throw, A waterman did rush among the waues, And by Gods ayde, his dangered life he saues. Whose ayde this Lord, did nobly then reward, And afterward to multiply regard. 39 A gratefull parte.The thriftles man, by some vnhappy corse, Offended in, a veniall cause of death. The law did pas: This Lord then tooke remorse On him that once, his life did helpe to saue. In lewe whereof his perdon he did craue. And afterward, that he might truly liue. This man he did, a yearely pension giue. 40 Ambition, wrath, enuy, and disdaine, Haunt Princes Courts, and doe the most enthrall: Passi?s which followes Princes Courts. But none of these his honor once could staine. Like to the snaile, he neuer clymde to fall. No, wrathfull moode his wisdome could appaule: On worldly pride, he fixt no enuious eye, Nor scornde the poore, where he good gifts did spye. 41 Although he liu'd in fauour of his prince, He neuer rose, by any mans disgrace: An honorable disposition. His actes so iust, as Enuy did convince, To noble to craue, for to inrich his race: Ready to giue, and gaue in evry place. On Honour he, and Uertue made his stay, And neuer faund, where fortune bare the sway. 42 His wisedome knowne, in many a cause before, Right meete, his prince, and C?m? weale to serue: Her maiestie by him did set much store. And to say trueth, no man could more deserue. Her Maiestie s?t him Ambassadour into Fraunce. Who with a charge, from which he did not swerue. In noble sorte, as seemde so sad a chaunce, Went to Condole, the King his death of Fraunce. 43 His honor thus by noble actions grewe, And all was grace, in which he was attir'd: At home, abroade, in peace, and warre most true, Aboue his hart, his vertues farre aspir'de. And crownde him with more praise then he desir'de The Scottish traines, did axe a trusty eye, Then through the North with speed this lord did hie. 44 He was Gouernour of Barwicke in her Maiest. Time.Of Barwicke he, the Gouernour was made. In which hye charge, he ruld without suspect. The Souldiers old, he did refresh and ayde. Who well deseru'de, he nobly did respect. Who did offende, he mildely, did correct: With Iustice he, did euer measure Grace, Which made him fear'd through loue in evry place. 45 A reuenge contrary to Martiall or politicke Iustice.The deadly foode, that thirsteth after blood His wisedome in those parts appeased much. The hollowe Scots (that seldome wisht vs good) Would often saye, there neuer gouernd such. Tride by his foes, his vertues bid the tuch. And truth to say, generall was the song: Th'earle of Bedford, did neuer Person wrong. 46 He was her Maiesties deputie to cristen the scottish king.In Scotland, when that in our soueraignes place, He Cristened the seemely Scottish King. He did the Rytes, with such a royall Grace. As that his fame, the Scottish writers ring. Enuyed there, Renowne, he home did bring. Lord Darley, her Maiest. subiect.The Scottish Prince, our Soueraignes subiect was, And so this Lord, euen there, by him did pas. 47 Returned home, where Lawrell rules the launce: Where Peace doth shine, which plenty doeth afford Where lawes do Trueth, and Equitie aduaunce. In Iustice seate, though Girt with Mars his sword: He was Warden of the stanerie in the West.Nothing but right was censurd by this Lord: Of many he: was Iudge, and wrongs redrest. As Warden of the stanerie in the West. 48 An office great, which some would wrest to gaine. Yet through his gaine, there was not one that lost: The true c?mendati? of the Iustice which he administred. A multitude belong vnto the traine. In ruling (whome of this) he chiefe may boast. His Iustice gaind, the fauour of the most. And for the rest, vpon a true account, His charge did neare vnto his gaine amount. 49 Lieutenant he was of the Westerne Coast, He was Lieutenant of the Counties of Dorcet, Deu? of Cornwaule at the time of his death, and oftentimes before. Where as he found, a number loued strife: What meanes he wrought (the Lawiers do not boast) The Lawiers in the Westerne Circuts murmured that he ended so many matters. For to appease, the discords that ware rife. He mou'd strong foes, to loue like man and wife. That lacke of worke, made Lawiers to exclame, But what of that it was a godly blame. 50 And truth to say, where peace and plentie raignes. Vnkind sutes vnnaturall in this peaceable Gouernment. It is a fault, to see our papar war: They know God wot, that tasted haue the paines. Where bookes do wound, as deep remaines y? scar. As browne bill strokes, which nothing reach so far. The reason is, the beast doe not accord, Their neighbours Iars, by sample of this Lord. 51 Though holsome lawes, do str?gth? C?m? weales, Law is to strong for evry trifleling cause: The fogging mate, is worse, then he that steales. The Petifogger, a d?gerous neighbour. Where sute is raisde, for wind &amp; wagging strawes, A foxe is found, among a sort of dawes. For you that sewe, put this in your beleefe, Law measures right, with toyle, expence and griefe The best end of law. 52 If like this Lord (whose fame cannot disseace, To appease smal discords a speciall duty of Iustices of peace.Make friends of Foes, the meaner Iustice would: To Iustices, might well be ioyned peace. This quiet raigne, doth challenge that they should: Their blame, nay shame that will not if they could. If not be sure each wheare will light the lote, Which once vpon a worldlings house was wrote. 53 Written vp? a cruel worldlings house.Thy Grownd-worke bilt, on discord and debate, Thy front of brick, Temperd with widowes teares, The Orphants spoyle, Thy windowes and thy state. Good yeomens falles, the beames that thee vp beares. A wonder if, thou, stand in this repaire, When built of wrongs, thy fairest beauties are. 54 Now to the Lord, of whome I lately spake, The Prouerbe goes (although more true then iust) A most honorable vertue in this Lord. The way is safe, the strongest parte to take: But sure the weake, that to the wall was thrust: His noble minde, did ayde in causes iust. Which made men sing, in open streetes this song There rydes the Lord, their strength that suffer wrong. 56 The Thralls which fled for persecutions feare: He was a gret comforter of persecuted strangers. He was highly regarded of forraigne princes,When as they saw the Pope, and Papists frowne. His purse and toung, in banishment did cheere All forraine states, yea persons of renowne. Whome Tyrants sought, to tumble hedlong downe. Upon his zeale: In England greatly stayde, Which Realme, they saw, god blessed for their ayde. 57 Whose grieues he did, in all he might releaue. His care for them, he shewed to the end: He was highly regarded of forraigne princes, which profes the Gospell. He greatly &amp; in what he might, furthered the succour of Flaunders. The Holland States, his loue did soundly preaue. Flaunders may say, that she hath lost a frend: To mende her state, much trauell he did spend, His helping hand, her sutors did not lacke, Which still appeard, till sicknes kept him backe. 57 The very bad, did reuerence his name, And all the good, with griefe his lose deplore. The strangers praise, doth blow abroade his fame, He was highly honored of strangers. Lou'd of his prince, for Valour, Truth, and Lore. A happy man, whome all men did Adore, Happy and blest, of God euen in his birth. Who here possest, the blessing of the earth. 58 Blessed he was, of God in mariage twise, His wiues were most gratious Ladies. His noble wiues the samples were of Grace: His Children such, as that in all mens eyes, Their actions did, their fathers vertues blaze, 3. Daughters of his, were al maried to Earles. His Daughters macht, with Earles of noble rase. His sonnes, himself, all Lords, or Knights did see, His sonnes were all Lords or Knights in his life time. By vertue raysd, as much as by degree. 59 What would you more, he was a Pharoes blase, To prye into whose gifts, doth dimme my eyes: Pharos, a w?derfull light made by Ptholomie Philodelphus for the derecti? of seafaring men. Like him that long against the Sonne doth gase. Of honour sound, in Iudgement graue and wise. In all good deeds, he euer was precyse. Aliue refuge, to those whome wrong did paine. Aliue and dead, vnbleamisht with a staine. 60 Long thus he liu'd, euen blessed from aboue. He was afflicted with a most violent sicknes, one yeare and more past.And tride in fine, as gold is in the fire. God chastiseth (quoth he) whome he doth loue, And trueth to say, his torment might attaint The strongest hart, yet, he did neuer faint: Yea martred long, with furious griefe and paine. No one can say, they hard him to complaine. 61 The griefe of hart, showde in the watry eyes, He was wonderfully martered by the Phisitions &amp; Surgieons. The gretnesse of his pati?ce.Of friends that saw, the mangling of his flesh. But he that felt, what griefe man may deuise, With comfort, did his Comforters refresh. His patience then, my pen cannot expres. His sicknes straunge, as straungely was he vsde. More strangely easde, when Art had him refusde. 62 What should I say that Science is deuine: The Doctors and Surgions gaue him ouer.Yet knowledge failes, vnlesse God blesseth skill. The maister Docters, gaue him ore in fine. And left his Cure, vnto the Lord his will. The mournfull cryes, the howse with sorrowes fill. M. Marrad &amp; Fowler westerne men, Surgions. Discription of the world, and of all estates.The Lord then had, compassion of our mone, And blest the workes, of men that ware vnknowne. 63 But o their Cure, did but prolong his paine, Euen from this Crosse, he longed Christ to see. He heald this world, and all her beauties vaine. The prowdest pompe, a short felicitie. The regall care, a Golden misery, The Maiestrate, an honorable thrawle. The poore man blest, whose c?science hath no gawle. 64 But ware mishap from worldly pleasure free, So short a vse may not be counted Ioy. Mans life is like, a bloome vpon a tree, The vncertaintie of life. Which evry storme, is ready to destroy. No threatning can the Monster death annoy. The certainty of death. From all his pompe, he takes the Prince away, Euen as the night, doth clowde the brightest day. 65 A sory tale, vnto the worldly thrawle, Which hath health, wealth, &amp; in his bowels peace: The worldly mans felicity Nemo ante obitum beatus. But foolish man, that these thy pleasures cawle, Thy lasting Ioye, is after thy decease. A graine of wheate doth rot ere it increase. Euen so the flesh, a lasting Ioye to giue, Must tourne to dust, and then the sowle doth liue. 66 And from this ground, this Lord did neuer smarue he likened life to voyages at Sea: Life like, voyages at Sea. Some short, some long, as winde and wether farue, And as men Ioy, their ships retourne to see, Because their wealth, within their bowels bee. The godly so, in death their comfort eye, Which made him liue, as he would dayly dye. 67 Retourne of health, which visibly was seene, Hee neuer had great care of worldly causes, since his former sicknes. Her Maiestie oftentime most gratiously visited him, in his former sicknes. To tempt this Lord, was but an ydle traine: The visiting of our most gratious Queene, Did glad his hart, but with no clyming vaine: Which swelleth still, where princes fauours raigne. She lou'd him as her strength in time of need, He honord her, with duty, zeale, and dread. 68 He straind him selfe, farre more then was his ease, To serue her highnesse, in his latter health: In Parlament, he did himselfe dissease, About sound lawes, to arme the Common wealth: But priuate gaine, he grounded on a shelfe, Came the Brydegrome by day or els by night. In his cleare lampe, he euer more had light. 69 Not like his worth, his life before is showne, His most godly and blessed ende.The more our losse his death doth now draw neare: What was his life, his godly death made knowne, His sharpe assaulte, his faith did nothing feare: One of his godly sayinges, in his last ende.His care was past, he found his Conscience cleare, He saw by faith, the perfect life in dead, The VVomans seede, trode on the Serpents head. 70 The senses of a number, fayle before they deseace.In those fearce panges, mans sences often quaile Their feeble heads, are full of Idle thought: Their hollowe eyes, of wordly sight do faile. Their foltring tonges, do wag and vtter nought: Their harts do pant, as they with death had fought. But he whose life, by none of these did wrong, In death had vse of eye, hart, head, and toung. 71 He had parfect vse of his senses vnto his latter gaspe.His head was free, from worldly thought and care, His harte did still contemplate of gods booke: His toung, his faith, did in his end declare: He lyuely c?fessed his faythe, in the tremblyng passage of deathe.His eyes abroade, did towards heauen looke. His hands he heau'd, when strength the rest forsooke, His chamber seem'd, a heauenly preaching place, Him selfe euen then, the soundest teacher was. 72 Among the rest, his sayings full of Grace, For our regard, this one would here remaine. I do thanke God, that I shall dye in peace, And do not liue, for to beholde the paine, A frutefull admonition vpon his last sayinge. Which for our sinnes, on earth is like to raigne. Regard it well, and each man one amend, What good men dreed, God forth most doth send. 73 S. Austine saith, that God is all in all, And with his Grace is euer with the good: It followes then, the wicked to appaule. His vengeance is, euen mixed with their blood. His mercy long, his Iustice hath forestood: But tempt not farre, the lothest man to fight, When he is mou'd, the soundest blowes doth smight. 74 England beware, bewarnd if thou be wise, Thy secret sinnes, for open vengeance crye: The words are mine, but his the sound aduise. What men forshaue, that ready are to dye. The sage do hold, euen for a prophesie. His eyes (no dobut) the hyest heauens did peace, And saw euen that, his toung did then rehearce. 75 For to conclude, the word, the deuill, and death, He vanquished, in all his housholds sight, From Gaspes, or Grones, ware free his latter breath, His departure most quiet. His life did weare, euen like, a Taper light: O happy soule, that made so strong a fight, And thus in fine, he mildly did disseace, Euen in the place, where long he liu'd in peace. 76 A happy ende, that Plato calleth blest: The end that he most gladly did imbrace. The ende, his, end that many since haue mist. The end that failes, his memory to deface, Whose vertues liue, and shineth in his race. The end that soone, had raild this heauy mone: Alas the Earle of Bedford now is gone. 77 Yea, he forth of this sinfull world is gone, Gone from the traines, of Enuy and disdaine: Gone, gone, before the knowledge of this mone, Which would haue grieu'de him more then all his paine: His noble sonne, treacherously is slaine, Of the vali?t Lord Russell.His sonne, his heire, of honor, Grace, and all. Stout Lord Russell, whom Mars we well might call. 78 A passion heare so duls my heauy muse, As that I faint, to sound his high renowne, My hand, and iudgement haue forgot their vse, To staine my worke, the teares do trickle downe. O dismall tune, where in the heauens should frowne To reaue at once, two Starres of Russels Fame, The Sire, and Sonne, to all this Realme amame. 79 Frauncis the Sire, deceast by natures Corse: Frauncis the Sonne, was slaine by Fortunes spight. By Fortunes spight, armed with treacherous force. But yet in spight, of all the spights their might, His fame shall shine, when shame shall raigne &amp; light, Upon his foes, and all the cursed seede, That gilty are, of this most impious deede. 80 God wilbe iust: you Murthrers then vniust, Your iudgement heare (although pronounst by me) The God that sayd, to Cain most accurst, God punisheth murder, for the most parte with visible vengeance. Who Caine doth kill, shall seauenfolde punisht be. Your Murther heare, euen in the worst degree, Where law of Armes, and martiall faith was broke Of God and man, will feele the wrathfull stroke. 81 I iudge not who are gilty of this deed: God will reueale, the deepth of all this reach: But this I say: his valour they did dread, At the spur. In the last siege of Edenbrough. Vide Holengh, Cro. Experience erst, before their eyes did teach, Where danger stood, his courage made a breach, Which made them seeke, by Cowardise his breath, Who would himselfe haue els reveng'd his death. 82 A shamefull part, vpon a day of Truse, Where mortall foes, no sharpe reuengement trye, He was treacherously slaine, vpon a daye of Truce. But once againe: who set this fowle abuse T'ware good that he, the Scottish borders flye, And desarts haunt, till vengeance make him dye: Yea there to dreede, vntill his wretched end, Each bush that sturres a RVSSELL or his frend. 83 But leaue we here, his foes vnto their fall, Euer since the last rebellion in the March. He followed all offers of seruice, in Scotland and the Northern partes. And see how hye firme vertue raisd this Lord, When Treason arm'd the Northerne parts with thrall, In tender yeares, with noble courage sturde. He left the Court, and tooke him to the sword: But did not with the multitude retower, When Rebels fled, before their Princes Power. 84 To stay him there, he maried in those parts, He maried the daughter and heire of S. Iohn Foster Knight. L. Warden of the midle marches.A louing wife: and S Iohn Fosters heire, Who dyed soone, yet for her sweete desarts, And for the zeale, he to that seruice bare. To leaue those parts, he neuer since had care: Whose gouerment, and hazard oft of blood, Approu'd him arm'd, to do his Country good. 85 The Romaine warres, record a noble fight, By Manlius sonne: in Combat with his foe: TITVS MANLIVS being Consul, commaunded that none of his Souldiers should fight, but when he commaunded them Genutius Manlius one of his Enimyes pricked forth of his Companie, and chalenged Manlius Sonne. The commandement of his father was that he should not fight. But he being the Consuls Sonne, rather then the Enimies [illeg.] him with Cowardise, preferred a certaine death, by breath [illeg.] Commandement, before a dishonorable life in refusing [illeg.] Hee slew his enimie and was himselfe put to death, by [illeg.] severe Iustice. Euen so this noble Lord, although not so tough [illeg.] because hee valiauntly aduentured his person in a Kings [illeg.] seruice, at the assaults of Edinbrough Castell, which Sir W Drurie, Lieutenant, had appointed for men of meaner reputation, was by the sayd Lieutenant Committed to ward. But albeit, discipline in martiall pollicie is to be reuer?sed. The noble courage of this Lord, aunswered [illeg.] —ing [illeg.]ous saying: that in matters of honorable danger, there ought to be no difference betweene a king and a meane Souldier: and through that thought vpon a mortall drought, hee powred a present of warship upon the ground because it sufficed nor to releaue his whole Armie, Vide Holing. Cro.His father yet, in all his Souldiers sight, Put him to death, because he did vndoe, His Order made, that none should hazard so. This Lord likewise, commaunded was to ward, For valiantnes, beyonde his lifes regard. 86 Knighted he was (and worthy in the field) He was Knighted by the Earle of Sussex, generall of the field. Who neuer yet did faint, to see his foe: Yea thus bettayde, when he was wild to yeld, He aunswered thus: That will I neuer doe, Add drewe his sword, but o they shot him through: His stout aunswere to his treacherous enimies. He liued, vntill the daye, after that hee was wounded. Yet home he went, and caried death aliue, So l?g as str?gth, with mortal wo?ds might striue. 87 What should I say In field a Mars he was, In time of peace, a stayde and noble Knight: In pride of yeares: to be cut vp like gras, Giues cause of mone, to many a worthy wight Of Chiualrie, who held him for the light: But all in vaine, To market to be sold, The young sheape comes, as well as doth the old. 88 To ward Deaths Dart, Honnour is no shield, Yong yeeres, faire lookes, nor prayer may intreate. Spes famæ solet ad virtutem impellere multos. Iohannes de Temporibus, liued in Charles the 5. time. The Prince, the Peere, and evry estate must yeld, Of fame yeat Death, the Conquest can not get Desire whereof mens mindes on vertue set. And sure this Lord, by Fame out liued here. Old Iohn of Tymes, that saw three hundred yeare. 89 He liued so, as he shall neuer dye, In Heauen nor earth, while any earth remaine: His godly life, is crownde aboue the skye: His noble deedes, which no fowle deed doth staine (Though veniall sinne, in evry flesh doth raigne) Doth make his life, his mortall life I saye, In fame to liue, till Mortall Tyme decaye. 90 I say no more, that can not praise too much, This Lord, that liued well and dyed blest: Fame spreades abroade, reports I dare not tuch, Till leaue do ioyne, in knowledge with the rest, Truth shields fr? shame, and Truth is yet exprest, And I in time, God willing will expose, With leaue obtainde, the practise of his foes. Viuit post funera virt?. AN EPITAPHE VPON THE DEATH of the right honorable Frauncis, Earle of Bedford, Baron Russell &amp;c. And of his most valiant Sonne, and heire S. Frauncis, Lord Russell, treacherously slaine by a Stratageme of the Scotes, and dyed the day before his noble father. Heare vnderneathe the Earle of Bedford lyes, Whose head was fraught, with Grace, &amp; godly care. Who eares were ope, to heare the poore m?s cries. Whose eyes to wish, his neighbours goods forbare: VVhose toung pronounst, but good and godly speach. VVhose hands still gaue, and seldome did receiue, VVhose holy life all sorts of men might teach. This painted world, did nothing but deceiue. He liu'd and dy'de, as he with God should raigne: But O his losse, ioynes with an other rod. His noble Sonne slaine by a Scottish traine. His father lead, the happy way to God, Vpon a day of truce, they did him wound, VVhome shame (no doubt) by vengeance will confound. Nemo ante obitum beatus.</field>
