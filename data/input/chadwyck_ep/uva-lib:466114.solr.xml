      <field name="fulltext">FROM THE HILL OF GARDENS The outline of a shadowy city spread Between the garden and the distant hill— And o'er yon dome the flame-ring lingers still, Set like the glory on an angel's head: The light fades quivering into evening blue Behind the pine-tops on Ianiculum; The swallow whispered to the swallow “come!” And took the sunset on her wings, and flew. One rift of cloud the wind caught up suspending A ruby path between the earth and sky; Those shreds of gold are angel wings ascending From where the sorrows of our singers lie; They have not found those wandering spirits yet, But seek for ever in the red sunset. Pass upward angel wings! Seek not for these, They sit not in the cypress-planted graves; Their spirits wander over moonlit waves, And sing in all the singing of the seas; And by green places in the spring-tide showers, And in the re-awakening of flowers. Some pearl-lipped shell still dewy with sea foam Bear back to whisper where their feet have trod; They are the earth's for evermore; fly home! And lay a daisy at the feet of God. IN THE COLISEUM Night wanes; I sit in the ruin alone; Beneath, the shadow of arches falls From the dim outline of the broken walls; And the half-light steals o'er the age-worn stone From a midway arch where the moon looks through, A silver shield in the deep, deep blue. This is the hour of ghosts that rise; —Line on line of the noiseless dead— The clouds above are their awning spread; Look into the shadow with moon-dazed eyes, You will see the writhing of limbs in pain, And the whole red tragedy over again. The ghostly galleys ride out and meet, The Cæsar sits in his golden chair, His fingers toy with his women's hair, The water is blood-red under his feet,— Till the owl's long cry dies down with the night, And one star waits for the dawning light. Rome, 1881. THE SEA-KING'S GRAVE High over the wild sea-border, on the furthest downs to the west, Is the green grave-mound of the Norseman, with the yew-tree grove on its crest. And I heard in the winds his story, as they leapt up salt from the wave, And tore at the creaking branches that grow from the sea-king's grave. Some son of the old-world Vikings, the wild sea-wandering lords, Who sailed in a snake-prowed galley, with a terror of twenty swords. From the fiords of the sunless winter, they came on an icy blast, Till over the whole world's sea-board the shadow of Odin passed, Till they sped to the inland waters and under the South-land skies, And stared on the puny princes, with their blue victorious eyes. And they said he was old and royal, and a warrior all his days, But the king who had slain his brother lived yet in the island ways. And he came from a hundred battles, and died in his last wild quest, For he said, “I will have my vengeance, and then I will take my rest.” He had passed on his homeward journey, and the king of the isles was dead; He had drunken the draught of triumph, and his cup was the isle-king's head; And he spoke of the song and feasting, and the gladness of things to be, And three days over the waters they rowed on a waveless sea. Till a small cloud rose to the shoreward, and a gust broke out of the cloud, And the spray beat over the rowers, and the murmur of winds was loud, With the voice of the far-off thunders, till the shuddering air grew warm, And the day was as dark as at even, and the wild god rode on the storm. But the old man laughed in the thunder as he set his casque on his brow, And he waved his sword in the lightnings and clung to the painted prow. And the shaft of the storm-god's quiver, flashed out from the flame-flushed skies, Rang down on his war-worn harness, and gleamed in his fiery eyes. And his mail and his crested helmet, and his hair, and his beard burned red; And they said, “It is Odin calls;” and he fell, and they found him dead. So here, in his war-guise armoured, they laid him down to his rest, In his casque with the rein-deer antlers, and the long grey beard on his breast: His bier was the spoil of the islands, with a sail for a shroud beneath, And an oar of his blood-red galley, and his battle brand in the sheath; And they buried his bow beside him, and planted the grove of yew, For the grave of a mighty archer, one tree for each of his crew; Where the flowerless cliffs are sheerest, where the sea-birds circle and swarm, And the rocks are at war with the waters, with their jagged grey teeth in the storm; And the huge Atlantic billows sweep in, and the mists enclose The hill with the grass-grown mound where the Norseman's yew-tree grows. A ROMAN MIRROR They found it in her hollow marble bed, There where the numberless dead cities sleep, They found it lying where the spade struck deep, A broken mirror by a maiden dead. These things—the beads she wore about her throat Alternate blue and amber all untied, A lamp to light her way, and on one side The toll men pay to that strange ferry-boat. No trace to-day of what in her was fair! Only the record of long years grown green Upon the mirror's lustreless dead sheen, Grown dim at last, when all else withered there. Dead, broken, lustreless! It keeps for me One picture of that immemorial land, For oft as I have held thee in my hand The dull bronze brightens, and I dream to see A fair face gazing in thee wondering wise, And o'er one marble shoulder all the while Strange lips that whisper till her own lips smile, And all the mirror laughs about her eyes. It was well thought to set thee there, so she Might smooth the windy ripples of her hair And knot their tangled waywardness, or ere She stood before the queen Persephone. And still it may be where the dead folk rest She holds a shadowy mirror to her eyes, And looks upon the changelessness, and sighs And sets the dead land lilies in her breast. 1879. BY THE SOUTH SEA So here we have sat by the sea so late, And you with your dreaming eyes Have argued well what I know you hate, Till even my own dream dies. Yet why will you smile at my old white years When love was a gift divine, When songs were laughter and hope and tears, And art was a people's shrine? Must I change the burdens I loved to sing, The words of my worn-out song? The old fair thoughts have a hollow ring, My faiths have been dead so long. And yet,—to have known that one did not know! To have dreamed with the poet priest! To have hope to feel that it might be so! And theirs was a faith at least. When the priest was poet, and hearts were fain Of marvellous things to dream, To see God's tears in a cloud of rain, And his hair on a gold sunbeam; To know that the sons of the old Sea King Roamed under their waves at will, To have heard a song that the wood gods sing On the other side of the hill! And so I had held it,—for all things blend In the world's great harmony,— That they served an end to an after-end, And were of the things that be. But now ye are bidding your God god-speed With his lore upon dusty shelves; So wise ye are grown, ye have found no need For any god but yourselves. Ye have learnt the riddle of seas and sand, Of leaves in the spring uncurled; There is no room left for my wonderland In the whole of the great wide world. And what have ye left for a song to say? What now is a singer's fame? He may startle the ear with a word one day, And die,—and live in a name. But the world has heed unto no fair thing, Men pass on their soulless ways, They give no faith unto those who sing, —Give hardly a heartless praise. But you say, Let us go unto all wide lands, Let us speak to the people's heart! Let us make good use of our lips and hands, There is hope for the world in art! Will the dull ears hear, will the dead souls see? Will they know what we hardly know? The chords of the wonderful harmony Of the earth and the skies?—if so— We have talked too long till it all seems vain,— The desire and the hopes that fired, The triumphs won and the meedless pain, And the heart that has hoped is tired. Do you see down there where the high cliffs shrink, And the ripples break on the bay, Our old sea boat at the white foam brink With the sail slackened down half-way? Shall we get hence? O fair heart's brother! You are weary at heart with me, We two alone in the world, no other: Shall we go to our wide kind sea? Shall we glide away in this white moon's track? Does it not seem fair in your eyes! —To drift and drift with our white sail black In the dreamful light of the skies, Till the pale stars die, and some far fair shore Comes up through the morning haze, And wandering hearts shall not wander more Far off from the mad world's ways. Or still more fair—when the dim scared night Grows pale from the east to the west— If the waters gather us home, and the light Break through on the waves' unrest, And there in the gleam of the gold-washed sea, Which the smile of the morning brings, Our souls shall fathom the mystery, And the riddle of all these things. 1879. IN A CHURCH This was the first shrine lit for Queen Marie; And I will sit a little at her feet, For winds without howl down the narrow street And storm-clouds gather from the westward sea. Sweet here to watch the peasant people pray, While through the crimson-shrouded window falls Low light of even, and the golden walls Grow dim and dreamful at the end of day, Till from these columns fades their marble sheen, And lines grow soft and mystical,—these wraiths That watch the service of the changing faiths, To Mary mother from the Cyprian queen. But aye for me this old-word colonnade Seems open to blue summer skies once more, These altars pass, and on the polished floor I see the lines of chequered light and shade; I seem to see the dark-browed Lybian lean To cool the tortured burning of the lash, I see the fountains as they leap and flash, The rustling sway of cypress set between. And now yon friar with the bare feet there, Is grown the haunting spirit of the place; Ah! brown-robed friar with the shaven face, The saints are weary of thy mumbled prayer. From matins' bell to the slow day's decline He sits and thumbs his endless round of beads, Drawls out the dreary cadence of his creeds And nods assent to each familiar line. But she the goddess whose white star is set, Whose fane was pillaged for this sombre shrine, Could she look down upon those lips of thine, And hear thee mutter, would she still regret? There came a sound of singing on my ear, And slowly glided through the far-off door A glimmer of grey forms like ghosts, they bore A dead man lying on his purple bier. Some poor man's soul, so little candle smoke Went curling upwards by the uncased shroud, And then a sudden thunder-clap broke loud, And drowned the droning of the priest who spoke. So all the shuffling feet passed out again To lightnings flashing through the wet and wind, And while I lingered in the gate behind The dead man travelled through the storm and rain. Rome, 1881. AT LANUVIUM “Festo quid potius die Neptuni faciam.” Horace, Odes, iii. 28. Spring grew to perfect summer in one day, And we lay there among the vines, to gaze Where Circe's isle floats purple, far away Above the golden haze: And on our ears there seemed to rise and fall The burden of an old world song we knew, That sang, “To-day is Neptune's festival, And we, what shall we do?” Go down brown-armed Campagna maid of mine, And bring again the earthen jar that lies With three years' dust above the mellow wine; And while the swift day dies, You first shall sing a song of waters blue, Paphos and Cnidos in the summer seas, And one who guides her swan-drawn chariot through The white-shored Cyclades; And I will take the second turn of song, Of floating tresses in the foam and surge Where Nereid maids about the sea-god throng; And night shall have her dirge. 1881. “IF ANY ONE RETURN” I would we had carried him far away To the light of this south sun land, Where the hills lean down to some red-rocked bay And the sea's blue breaks into snow-white spray As the wave dies out on the sand. Not there, not there, where the winds deface! Where the storm and the cloud race by! But far away in this flowerful place Where endless summers retouch, retrace, What flowers find heart to die. And if ever the souls of the loved, set free, Come back to the souls that stay, I could dream he would sit for a while with me Where I sit by this wonderful tideless sea And look to the red-rocked bay, By the high cliff's edge where the wild weeds twine, And he would not speak or move, But his eyes would gaze from his soul at mine, My eyes that would answer without one sign, And that were enough for love. And I think I should feel as the sun went round That he was not there any more, But dews were wet on the grass-grown mound On the bed of my love lying underground, And evening pale on the shore. 1879. SONNETS “UNE HEURE VIENDRA QUI TOUT PAIERA” It was a tomb in Flanders, old and grey, A knight in armour, lying dead, unknown Among the long-forgotten, yet the stone Cried out for vengeance where the dead man lay; No name was chiselled at his side to say What wrongs his spirit thirsted to atone, Only the armour with green moss o'ergrown, And those grim words no years had worn away. It may be haply in the songs of old His deeds were wonders to sweet music set, His name the thunder of a battle call, Among the things forgotten and untold; His only record is the dead man's threat,— “An hour will come that shall atone for all!” 1879. ACTEA When the last bitterness was past, she bore Her singing Cæsar to the Garden Hill, Her fallen pitiful dead emperor. She lifted up the beggar's cloak he wore —The one thing living he would not kill— And on those lips of his that sang no more, That world-loathed head which she found lovely still, Her cold lips closed, in death she had her will. Oh wreck of the lost human soul left free To gorge the beast thy mask of manhood screened! Because one living thing, albeit a slave, Shed those hot tears on thy dishonoured grave, Although thy curse be as the shoreless sea, Because she loved, thou art not wholly fiend. 1881. IMPERATOR AUGUSTUS Is this the man by whose decree abide The lives of countless nations, with the trace Of fresh tears wet upon the hard cold face? —He wept, because a little child had died. They set a marble image by his side, A sculptured Eros, ready for the chase; It wore the dead boy's features, and the grace Of pretty ways that were the old man's pride. And so he smiled, grown softer now, and tired Of too much empire, and it seemed a joy Fondly to stroke and pet the curly head, The smooth round limbs so strangely like the dead, To kiss the white lips of his marble boy And call by name his little heart's-desired. 1879. “ATQUE IN PERPETUUM FRATER AVE ATQUE VALE” This was the end love made,—the hard-drawn breath, The last long sigh that ever man sighs here; And then for us, the great unanswered fear, Will love live on,—the other side of death? Only a year, and I had hoped to spend A life of pleasant communing, to be A kindred spirit holding fast to thee, We never thought that love had such an end. This was the end love made, for our delight, For one sweet year he cannot take away;— Those tapers burning in the dim half-light, Those kneeling women with a cross that pray, And there, beneath green leaves and lilies white, Beyond the reach of love, our loved one lay. 1879. ON THE BORDER HILLS So the dark shadows deepen in the trees That crown the border mountains, all the air Is filled with mist-begotten phantasies, Shaped and transfigured in the sunset glare. What wildly spurring warrior-wraiths are these? What tossing headgear, and what red-gold hair? What lances flashing, what far trumpet's blare That dies along the desultory breeze? Slow night comes creeping with her misty wings Up to the hill's crest, where the yew trees grow; About their shadow-haunted circle clings The rumour of an unrecorded woe, Old as the battle of those border kings Slain in the darkling hollow-lands below. 1881. SONGS LONG AFTER I see your white arms gliding, In music o'er the keys, Long drooping lashes hiding A blue like summer seas: The sweet lips wide asunder, That tremble as you sing, I could not choose but wonder, You seemed so fair a thing. For all these long years after The dream has never died, I still can hear your laughter, Still see you at my side; One lily hiding under The waves of golden hair; I could not choose but wonder, You were so strangely fair. I keep the flower you braided Among those waves of gold, The leaves are sere and faded, And like our love grown old. Our lives have lain asunder, The years are long, and yet, I could not choose but wonder. I cannot quite forget. 1880. “WHERE THE RHONE GOES DOWN TO THE SEA” A sweet still night of the vintage time, Where the Rhone goes down to the sea; The distant sound of a midnight chime Comes over the wave to me. Only the hills and the stars o'erhead Bring back dreams of the days long dead, While the Rhone goes down to the sea. The years are long, and the world is wide, And we all went down to the sea; The ripples splash as we onward glide, And I dream they are here with me— All lost friends whom we all loved so, In the old mad life of long ago, Who all went down to the sea. So we passed in the golden days With the summer down to the sea. They wander still over weary ways, And come not again to me. I am here alone with the night wind's sigh, The fading stars, and a dream gone by, And the Rhone going down to the sea. 1880. A SONG OF AUTUMN All through the golden weather Until the autumn fell, Our lives went by together So wildly and so well.— But autumn's wind uncloses The heart of all your flowers, I think as with the roses, So hath it been with ours. Like some divided river Your ways and mine will be, —To drift apart for ever, For ever till the sea. And yet for one word spoken, One whisper of regret, The dream had not been broken And love were with us yet. 1880. ?????? ????? The autumn wind goes sighing Through the quivering aspen tree, The swallows will be flying Toward their summer sea; The grapes begin to sweeten On the trellised vine above, And on my brows have beaten The little wings of love. Oh wind if you should meet her You will whisper all I sing! Oh swallow fly to greet her, And bring me word in spring! 1881. ATALANTA Wait not along the shore, they will not come; The suns go down beyond the windy seas, Those weary sails shall never wing them home O'er this white foam; No voice from these On any landward wind that dies among the trees. Gone south, it may be, rudderless, astray, Gone where the winds and ocean currents bore, Out of all tracks along the sea's highway This many a day, To some far shore Where never wild seas break, or any fierce winds roar. For there are lands ye never recked of yet Between the blue of stormless sea and sky, Beyond where any suns of yours have set, Or these waves fret; And loud winds die In cloudless summertide, where those far islands lie. They will not come! for on the coral shore The good ship lies, by little waves caressed, All stormy ways and wanderings are o'er, No more, no more! But long sweet rest, In cool green meadow-lands, that lie along the West. Or if beneath far fathom depths of waves She lies heeled over by the slow tide's sweep, Deep down where never any swift sea raves, Through ocean caves, A dreaming deep Of softly gliding forms, a glimmering world of sleep. Then have they passed beyond the outer gate Through death to knowledge of all things, and so From out the silence of their unknown fate They bid us wait, Who only know That twixt their loves and ours the great seas ebb and flow. THE DAISY With little white leaves in the grasses, Spread wide for the smile of the sun, It waits till the daylight passes, And closes them one by one. I have asked why it closed at even, And I know what it wished to say: There are stars all night in the heaven, And I am the star of day. 1881. “WHEN I AM DEAD” When I am dead, my spirit Shall wander far and free, Through realms the dead inherit Of earth and sky and sea; Through morning dawn and gloaming, By midnight moons at will, By shores where the waves are foaming, By seas where the waves are still. I, following late behind you, In wingless sleepless flight, Will wander till I find you, In sunshine or twilight; With silent kiss for greeting On lips and eyes and head, In that strange after-meeting Shall love be perfected. We shall lie in summer breezes And pass where whirlwinds go, And the Northern blast that freezes Shall bear us with the snow. We shall stand above the thunder, And watch the lightnings hurled At the misty mountains under, Of the dim forsaken world. We shall find our footsteps' traces, And passing hand in hand By old familiar places, We shall laugh, and understand. 1881. AFTER HEINE The leaves are falling, falling, The yellow treetops wave, Ah, all delight and beauty Is drawing to the grave. About the wood's crest flicker The wan sun's laggard rays, They are the parting kisses Of fleeting summer days. Meseems I should be shedding The heart's-tears from my eyes, The day will keep recalling The time of our good-byes: I knew that you were dying And I must pass away, Oh I was the waning summer, And you were the wood's decay. 1881. “THOSE DAYS ARE LONG DEPARTED” Those days are long departed, Gone where the dead dreams are, Since we two children started To look for the morning star. We asked our way of the swallow In his language that we knew, We were sad we could not follow So swift the blue bird flew. We set our wherry drifting Between the poplar trees, And the banks of meadows shifting Were the shores of unknown seas. We talked of the white snow prairies That lie by the Northern lights, And of woodlands where the fairies Are seen in the moonlit nights. Till one long day was over And we grew too tired to roam, And through the corn and clover We slowly wandered home. Ah child! with love and laughter We had journeyed out so far; We who went in the big years after To look for another star; But I go unbefriended Through wind and rain and foam,— One day was hardly ended When the angel took you home. 1881. A STAR-DREAM There was a night when you and I Looked up from where we lay, When we were children, and the sky Was not so far away. We looked toward the deep dark blue Beyond our window bars, And into all our dreaming drew The spirit of the stars. We did not see the world asleep— We were already there! We did not find the way so steep To climb that starry stair. And faint at first and fitfully, Then sweet and shrill and near, We heard the eternal harmony That only angels hear; And many a hue of many a gem We found for you to wear, And many a shining diadem To bind about your hair; We saw beneath us faint and far The little cloudlets strewn, And I became a wandering star, And you became my moon. Ah! have you found our starry skies? Where are you all the years? Oh, moon of many memories! Oh, star of many tears! 1881. AFTER HEINE Beautiful fisherman's daughter, Steer in your bark to the land! Come down to me over the water And talk to me hand in hand! Lay here on my heart those tresses, For look, what have you to fear Who are bold with the sea's caresses Every day in the year? My heart is at one with the deep In its storm, in its ebb and flow, And ah! There are pearls asleep In cavernous depths below. 1880. AFTER HEINE How the mirrored moonbeams quiver On the waters' fall and rise, Yet the moon serene as ever Wanders through the quiet skies. Like the mirrored moonlight's fretting Are the dreams I have of you, For my heart will beat, forgetting You are ever calm and true. ENDYMION She came upon me in the middle day, Bowed o'er the waters of a mountain mere; Where dimly mirrored in the ripple's play I saw some fair thing near. I saw the waters lapping round her feet, The widening rings spread, follow out and die, I saw the mirror and the mirrored meet, And heard a voice hard by. So I, Endymion, who lay bathing there, Half-hidden in the coolness of the lake, Looked up and swept away my long wild hair, And knew a goddess spake; A form white limbed and peerless, far above The very fairest of imagined things, The perfect vision of a dream of love Stepped through the water-rings; That breathed soft names and drew me to her arms, White arms and clinging in a long caress, And won me willing, by the magic charms Of perfect loveliness: Till on my breast a throbbing bosom lies; The dim hills waver and the dark woods roll, For all the longing of two glorious eyes Takes hold upon my soul. Then only when the sudden darkness fell Upon the silver of the mountain mere, And through the pine trees of the slanting dell, The moon rose cold and clear, I seemed alone upon the dewy shore,— For she had left me as she came unwarned;— And fell from sighing into sleep, before The summer morning dawned. What wonder now I find no maiden fair Who dwells between these mountains and the seas? And go unloving and unloved, or ere I turn to such as these. What wonder if the light of those wide eyes Makes other eyes seem cold; for that loud laughter Lost love has nothing left but sighs For all the time hereafter. Yet better so, far better, no regret Can touch my heart for that sweet memory's sake, But only sighing for the sun that set Behind the summer lake. But yestermorn it was, the second night Comes softly stealing over yon blue steep; The world grows silent in the fading light, There is no joy but sleep. —I cannot bear her fair face in the skies Beyond the drowsy waving of the trees,— A soft breeze kisses round my heavy eyes, A restful summer breeze. What means this dreamless apathy of sleep? —A mist steals over the dim lake, the shore, Until my closing eyes forget to weep— Oh, let me wake no more! DISILLUSION Ah! what would youth be doing To hoist his crimson sails, To leave the wood-doves cooing, The song of nightingales; To leave this woodland quiet For murmuring winds at strife, For waves that foam and riot About the seas of life? From still bays silver sanded Wild currents hasten down, To rocks where ships are stranded And eddies where men drown. Far out, by hills surrounded, Is the golden haven gate, And all beyond unbounded Are shoreless seas of fate. They steer for those far highlands Across the summer tide, And dream of fairy islands Upon the further side. They only see the sunlight, The flashing of gold bars, But the other side is moonlight And glimmer of pale stars. They will not heed the warning Blown back on every wind, For hope is born with morning, The secret is behind. Whirled through in wild confusion They pass the narrow strait, To the sea of disillusion That lies beyond the gate. REQUIESCAT He had the poet's eyes, —Sing to him sleeping,— Sweet grace of low replies, —Why are we weeping? He had the gentle ways, —Fair dreams befall him!— Beauty through all his days, —Then why recall him?— That which in him was fair Still shall be ours: Yet, yet my heart lies there Under the flowers. 1881. IN CHARTRES CATHEDRAL Through yonder windows stained and old Four level rays of red and gold Strike down the twilight dim, Four lifted heads are aureoled Of the sculptured cherubim, And soft like sounds on faint winds blown Of voices dying far away, The organ's dreamy undertone, The murmur while they pray; And I sit here alone alone And have no word to say; Cling closer shadows, darker yet, And heart be happy to forget. And now, the mystic silence—and they kneel A young priest lifts a star of gold,— And then the sudden organ peal! Ave and Ave! and the music rolled Along the carven wonder of the choir Thrilled canopy and spire, Up till the echoes mingled with the song; And now a boy's flute note that rings Shrill sweet and long, Ave and Ave, louder and more loud Rises the strain he sings, Upon the angel's wings! Right up to God! And you that sit there in the lowliest place, With lips that hardly dare to move, You with the old sad furrowed face Dream on your dream of love! For you, glide down the music's swell The folding arms of peace, For me wild thoughts, I dare not tell Desires that never cease. For you the calm, the angel's breast Whose dim foreknowledge is at rest; For me the beat of broken wings The old unanswered questionings. HIC JACET Did you play here child The whole spring through And smiled and smiled And never knew?— Where the shade is cool And the grass grows deep, One that was beautiful Lies in his sleep. Ah no child, never Will he arise, The sleep was for ever That closed his eyes. And his bed is strewn Deep underground, He was tired so soon, And now sleeps sound. When the first birds sing We can hear them, dear, And in early spring There are snowdrops here. For the flowers love him That lies below, And ever above him The daisies grow. “Shall we look down deep Where he hides away? Shall we find him asleep?” Yes child, some day. But his palace gate Is so hard to see, We two must wait For the angel's key. AT TIBER MOUTH The low plains stretch to the west with a glimmer of rustling weeds, Where the waves of a golden river wind home by the marshy meads; And the strong wind born of the sea grows faint with a sickly breath, As it stays in the fretting rushes and blows on the dews of death. We came to the silent city, in the glare of the noontide heat, When the sound of a whisper rang through the length of the lonely street; No tree in the clefted ruin, no echo of song nor sound, But the dust of a world forgotten lay under the barren ground. There are shrines under these green hillocks to the beautiful gods that sleep, Where they prayed in the stormy season for lives gone out on the deep; And here in the grave street sculptured, old record of loves and tears, By the dust of the nameless slave, forgotten a thousand years. Not ever again at even shall ship sail in on the breeze, Where the hulls of their gilded galleys came home from a hundred seas, For the marsh plants grow in her haven, the marsh birds breed in her bay, And a mile to the shoreless westward the water has passed away. But the sea-folk gathering rushes come up from the windy shore, So the song that the years have silenced grows musical there once more; And now and again unburied, like some still voice from the dead, They light on the fallen shoulder and the lines of a marble head. But we went from the sorrowful city and wandered away at will, And thought of the breathing marble and the words that are music still. How full were their lives that laboured, in their fetterless strength and far From the ways that our feet have chosen as the sunlight is from the star, They clung to the chance and promise that once while the years are free Look over our life's horizon as the sun looks over the sea, But we wait for a day that dawns not, and cry for unclouded skies, And while we are deep in dreaming the light that was o'er us dies; We know not what of the present we shall stretch out our hand to save Who sing of the life we long for, and not of the life we have; And yet if the chance were with us to gather the days misspent, Should we change the old resting-places, the wandering ways we went? They were strong, but the years are stronger; they are grown but a name that thrills, And the wreck of their marble glory lies ghost-like over their hills. So a shadow fell o'er our dreaming for the weary heart of the past, For the seed that the years have scattered, to reap so little at last. And we went to the sea-shore forest, through a long colonnade of pines, Where the skies peep in and the sea, with a flitting of silver lines. And we came on an open place in the green deep heart of the wood Where I think in the years forgotten an altar of Faunus stood; From a spring in the long dark grasses two rivulets rise and run By the length of their sandy borders where the snake lies coiled in the sun. And the stars of the white narcissus lie over the grass like snow, And beyond in the shadowy places the crimson cyclamens grow; Far up from their wave home yonder the sea-winds murmuring pass, The branches quiver and creak and the lizard starts in the grass. And we lay in the untrod moss and pillowed our cheeks with flowers, While the sun went over our heads, and we took no count of the hours; From the end of the waving branches and under the cloudless blue Like sunbeams chained for a banner the thread-like gossamers flew. And the joy of the woods came o'er us, and we felt that our world was young With the gladness of years unspent and the sorrow of life unsung. So we passed with a sound of singing along to the seaward way, Where the sails of the fishermen folk came home-ward over the bay; For a cloud grew over the forest and darkened the sea-god's shrine, And the hills of the silent city were only a ruby line. But the sun stood still on the waves as we passed from the fading shores, And shone on our boat's red bulwarks and the golden blades of the oars, And it seemed as we steered for the sunset that we passed through a twilight sea, From the gloom of a world forgotten to the light of a world to be.
