      <field name="fulltext">TO FREDERICK J?S, Esq. PATENTEE OF THE THEATRE ROYAL. FIRST EPISTLE. Tu, quid ego, et populus mecum desideret, audi. Hor. A. P J?s To such of my readers as have the misfortune not to belong to Daly's, or be in habits of eating with the bon vivants of Dublin, it may be necessary to say, that Mr. J?s understands the regulation of a table at least as well as that of a Theatre; which is not surprising, when we consider how much more the former has employed his thoughts and his time., who direct with equal skill The bill of fare, and play-house bill, Whose taste all other palates sways Either in dishes, or in plays, And rightly judges where there should Come entremets or interlude; Whose genius never at a loss is Either for farces, or for sauces, And regulates with happiest care An epilogue or a dessert. You, who with equal judgment sit The arbiter of wine and wit, By palate and by patent plac'd Upon the double throne of taste; If you, dear Manager, can spare a Moment from Turbot and Madeira, You'll find perhaps that my Epistle, Tho' not so sweet to mouth or whistle, And flat, in edible respect, Is savoury to the intellect. For I would seek the wond'rous cause, That abrogates our ancient laws, And like the Gallic revolution, Subverts old Crow-street's constitution; Thus Shakespeare, Monarch of the realm Of plays, his subjects overwhelm, And mad with rebel fury grown, Insult, and sentence, and dethrone;— Thus Fletcher, Jonson, Otway, Rowe, The nobles of the stage, are low, Or else dispers'd by barbarous arts, Are Our old English authors however despised at home, are in high request abroad, and afford indeed a very ample fund to the French and German plagaries. émigrés in foreign parts; Whilst in their places rise and sit, The very tiers-etat of wit; And high o'er all in tragic rage Without having any great respect for Kotzebue's moral character, it is but justice to declare, that it is only in his dramatic capacity that I compare him with the worst man of this, or perhaps of any age.Kotzebue, chief consul of the stage; Of lineage foreign and obscure, Of manners harsh, of thought impure; Bold, brutal, bloody and in few, Just like his brother of St. Cloud. In managers, the stage and state Have to lament as hard a fate; 'Tis no more Barry, or Choiseul, Fleuri, or Sheridan, that rule, But Talleyrand and J?s appear, And Fouché there, and F?ll?m Far be it from me to put those respectable gentlemen, in the same rank with the apostate Talleyrand, or the Septembriser Fouché, in any other than a metaphorical sense; they are the ministers of a revolutionized stage; as such I dislike and oppose their administration: But very unlike other oppositionists, I may be brought over by a change of measures, without a change of men.—If Mr. Windham reads this note, he will pronounce me an egregious blockhead. here. But with comparisons a truce— What is our manager's excuse? What can he urge in his defence, For want of judgment and of sense? “He owns,” he says, “the ancient plays “Are seldom acted now-a-days, “And modern critics rather choose “A younger than a grandam muse; “That 'tis his business to provide “For people's tastes and not to guide, “And with the nice and squeamish town, “That novelties alone go down.” But can we not ourselves produce These novelties for Irish use, That we to foreign hands must roam, For goods we us'd to make at home? Where is the soul of drama fled? Is genius paralyz'd or dead? That artless Southerne's Divini ingegni, i quali coi lor belissimi pensieri e noblissimi opere la patria ed età loro adornavano. Tolom: Oraz. And shall we never see their like again?— native shore, Produces tragic bards no more. Shall Farquhar's, Congreve's, native isle No more with wit peculiar smile? And can no kindred soul, from death, Catch Sheridan's expiring breath, And give the stage, for one life more, A lease of humour's choicest store? Does time with niggard hand inspire Our later age with feebler fire? Or is it that dramatic genius In Ireland's a crime so heinous, That no man durst presume to shew it Either as player or as poet?— Heaven ne'er inflicts a mental blight On all abilities outright; The rain and wind will ruin corn, But what can mildew wit unborn, And blast like barley, wheat or bere Genius “en ventre de sa mere.” How comes it then that 'tis by rumour Alone, we know of Irish humour, And our dramatic talent all is Comprized in Atk?on Joseph Atk?on, Esq. M. R. I. A. &amp;c. &amp;c. Author of “Love in a Blaze,” an operatical drama, a strange collection of stupid, and sometimes indecent vulgarisms, upon which Sir John Stevenson threw away some very good music, which it had cost him much trouble to compile. “A cette mervielle là, “Plus d'un spectature bailla.” Some even went further, and were even rude enough to hiss; nor had poor Atk?on the satisfaction of adding to the “populus me sibilat”the “nummus contemplor in arcâ” his piece was damned, and most unprofitably damned, tho' he himself attended the representation, and encouraged it with extraordinary efforts of personal applause. and La?ess? L?ess, the author of “Trial's All,” a Comedy, produced not long since at Crow-street. If I remember rightly, the plot was, that a young man, accused of a conspiracy, is brought to trial and acquitted; what could have turned Mr. L?ess's cogitations to such Green-street subjects?— Poor Atk?on, kind hearted creature. Soul of good humour and good nature, Whose inoffensive gabble runs Eternal, with eternal puns, But fit to write a play, no more Than J?b P?le, J?b P?le, our late Lord M?r, a citizen of pretorian activity and critical acumen. or Lord Gl?ore. I am told that this noble Peer is a scholar and a man of parts; shall I venture to own, I never could discover in him any resemblance to either. He would make a good Lord of the bed-chamber, but for any thing else—!!! La?ess indeed I own is not Unfit to carry on a plot, Can these mean play-house plots and unities?—Mr. L?ess, I am told, has consulted Counsel, with a view of prosecuting my Printer for a libel. Is this then the stuff of which patriots are made? Are those the men who profess themselves friends to the liberty of the press? The very word Press conjures up odd recollections, and they are not recollections of consistency and candour. And, as we're ready to confess, Preserves the unities t' excess; But for the rest,—the glowing mind, Terse thought, and dialogue refin'd; He'll do our country as much honour As Nelson, Russel, or O'Connor. Unhappy Dowling! This person from being a brazier, metamorphosed himself into a very middling painter, and finally became an indifferent actor, under the title of Mr. Herbert.—He fathered L?ess's play, which before representation was extolled as a miracle of genius, but alas! “Trial's All”—the piece was not so fortunate as its hero. I do not forget to Mr. D?ing, the play he chose for his benefit in a time of sedition and Jacobinism, when even those who in general were incredulous of proverbs, began to fear that ‘Vis unita fortior’ was but too true. I hope Mr. Dowling's error was not intentional, or if it was, that he has come to a sounder way of thinking. on your head The crimes of other men were shed, And prudent L?less heard secur'd The hearty hiss that you endur'd, Whilst in your secret soul you thought 'Twere better hammer pan or pot, Or e'en with hireling pencil trace G?n's Had these gentlemen not been often publicly assured that they were not beauties, I should not have presumed to have made them the au pis aller, of a painter's aversion. shape, or K?x's Had these gentlemen not been often publicly assured that they were not beauties, I should not have presumed to have made them the au pis aller, of a painter's aversion. face, Than hope to rise to wealth or fame, By father'd play and borrow'd name. But some aver that the defect Springs from the Manager's neglect; “For who of common sense,” they say, “Would write what there are none to play, “Or venture to entrust his pieces “To such a company as this is, “Who seem with equal skill to handle “Lock and Key, and School for Scandal. “Holman Holman is now in London, soliciting the acceptation of a piece, written during his stay in Ireland— The play it appears has been damned, but this does not affect my argument: had it been brought out here, it would have been doubly damned, once for its own sake, and again for that of the players. may carry to our neighbours “Of Drury Lane, his Irish labours, “And M?e, Tommy M?e. In Ireland we used to shew our admiration of his poetic talents, by asking him to supper; in England they reward him with a commercial, and in some degree legal office—this shows the difference of the national taste;—with us, abilities are dissipated in conviviality, and with them, fettered by the ties of interest and business. Between us, I fancy poor Tom is not likely to be much improved, or even enriched. And I am truly sorry for it; for with about as many faults as other people have, he possesses twice as much genius and agreeability as any body else. I cannot say much for his morality.— with Coleman's aid evince “His genius in the Gipsey Prince, “But bards in gen'ral would be undone “By the mere journey up to London. “And thus in Irish durance pent, “The brightest mind must be content “To see our In such hands, if any person were mad enough to write for the Irish stage, I fancy we might say with the French Vaudeville: Tandis que l'un tombe sur l'or.

On voit quelquesois un amant Tomber au genoux de ses belles; Mais ce qui tombe très souvent, Ce sont nos pièces nouvelles. thespian murderers maul “His scenes, or else not write at all.”— This censure, whether false or just, Cannot at present be discuss'd, But if I find, you take not this ill I'll weigh it in my next Epistle. The Reader will observe, that this line bears the mark of my original design of publishing by livraisons—let me add, that I have reason to hope Mr. Jones does not take my freedom ill. He is too much a man of the world, to be vexed at a little good humoured raillery on his scientia edendi—I dare say had I even told the story of the ham slewed in Madeira he would have forgiven me. SECOND EPISTLE. [TO FREDERICK J?S] Mimæ balatrones hoc genus omne Mæstum ac Sollicitum est: Hor. L. 1. S. 2. A flourish, trumpets! beat ye drums, The Crow-street corps in triumph comes, Fierce in theatric pride, This allegorical or rather prophetical commotion, which in the first Edition was only a vision of fancy, has been fully realized.—In vain did the Patentee advise the players not to buy the Book, in vain did he send one copy to the Green-room, to supersede the necessity of general purchase, in vain did he exhort them to say nothing about it, and that it would “die and be forgotten”—all in vain, the pertinaceous Book would not die, and the indiscreet actors took care it should not be forgotten—?? ??? ????? ????? ???? ?????? this, with perhaps some little merit in the work, has been the occasion that five hundred copies have been sold in a few days, and the eyes of five hundred people have been directed to a subject of national importance—“nunc” I may say with Tacitus “perfecto spectaculo apertum iter.”— they take The hostile field for glory's sake, To vindicate before the town Their master's honour and their own; And prove to visual demonstration, The justice of their reputation. In person every gallant soul That nightly drains the tragic bowl; And all who in the comic strife Kick up their heels and call it life; And every son of farce, and all Who op'ras scrape, or op'ras squall, Each Leap-Jack that thro' ballets capers, And all who light and snuff the tapers: And last the household forces rally, Led on by modest Mc.

His activity to discover the Author of these Letters, has been as constant as unsuccessful, and his criticisms on my Work, aye the deputy Box-keeper's criticisms, have been as daring as ridiculous; a kind of old clothes man of news, he ran about picking up shreds and patches of information, with which he formed a party-colored jacket for the imaginary author.—I did not wish to mention him, but he knows by what imperious means he has forced himself into the honor of “nitching into verse,” but I hope I have gagged him at last, and that henceforward he may be deterred from thinking or speaking of what heaven has set apart from low rank, and mean understandings.

But this is error;—sternest grief Bars not the soul from all relief; And human feelings ne'er remain Stretch'd on the unceasing rack of pain.— Poor Shore, some rays of hope beguile, And Denmark's queen must sometimes smile; Maternal joy, in Constance, speaks, And lives on Lady Randolph's cheeks.— Short is the beam that breaks the night Of grief, but thence 'tis doubly bright, And woe so touching ne'er appears, As April smiles, thro' showers of tears.

If youth and loveliness could charm, Or shape the critic coldness warm, Could gay variety dispense On every essay, excellenee; And were we only bound to tell How much one plays, and not how well;— To W?lst?in On revising my opinion of this young lady, I find that it is perhaps too favourable—but n'importe, the world always receives a man's commendations of a pretty woman, cum grano salis. then, this votive line, A galaxy of praise should shine, And every word I write upon her, Should offer eulogy and honour;— But she whom all pursuits engage, This female Proteus of the stage, Who thro' all nature boldly flies, And in one little fortnight tries Calista, Yarico, and Nell, And poor Sir Peter's rural belle, Cannot, in reason, hope to claim In all her parts, an equal fame. I own her feeling, taste and spirit, Her versatility of merit, I own that it were hard to find In one, more excellence combin'd; But should she therefore grasp at all, The gay, the grave, the great, the small; And, vainly, prove herself at heart A kind of Crow-street Bonaparte? Will no one whisper, that she plays ill The froward mirth of Lady Teazle; Or hint that nothing can beguile, To humour, her sepulchral A legal wit said of a brother barrister, that a smile on his countenance was like plating on a coffin. Such is Miss W?lst?in's attempt to look sprightly: She plays the gay parts of Miss Hardy tolerably, because she plays them in a mask. To her success, however, in this character, we are to attribute a good deal of the vanity I complain of, I wish she could get some of her male acquaintance to translate for her use, this excellent precept of Horace: Memento—servare mentem, Ab insolenti temperatam Lætitiâ.

I am glad to relate the anecdote that so much good tears should not go for nothing. Learn, W?lst?in from their baffled pride, To follow nature as your guide, Or—but the candid muse will spare Comparisons 't were hard to bear!— Alas! how willingly I'd raise The song of undiminish'd praise; If, spite of beauty and of youth, You were not still less fair than truth, Amicus Plato magis amica veritas. Believe me W?lst?in that I blame The spots of error on your fame, Only in hopes to see it rise, The unclouded radiance of our skies. But who is this, all boots and breeches, Cravat and cape, and spurs and switches, Grin and grimace and shrugs and capers, And affectation, spleen, and vapours? Oh, Mr. Richard J?s, This youth has a kind of merit, which he greatly overates, but which a little study and some slight efforts at remedying the original defects of education and manners, may improve to perhaps more than respectability. He is almost always lively, never rational, sometimes amusing, seldom intelligible: on a stage nearly barren of merit, it is natural he should be “fêté” inoculus inter cæcos, is a very considerable person. He is almost the “acteur gáté” that Gil Blas describes, “a qui le parterre pardonne tout; on lui marquoit trop le plaisir que l'on prenoit a le voir, aussi en abusait-il; si l'on eût fifflé; au lieu de crier miracle, on lui auroit souvent rendu justice.”—Let me however do justice to his Diddler; the character is luckily as extravagant (I mean metaphorically) as the actor; and both are wonderfully outres and entertaining. your humble; Prithee give o'er to mouth and mumble; Stand still, speak plain, and let us hear What was intended for the ear, For faith without the timely aid, Of bills, no parts you've ever played, Handy, Shuffleton, or Rover, Sharper, Stroller, Lounger, Lover, Could I amidst your mad-cap pother Ever distinguish from each other. Lewis 'tis true that Lewis, has great faults and great beauties; why should not R. J?s be as capable of imitating the latter as the former?—He has undoubtedly no inconsiderable disposition towards making a good actor, and I own I should not have treated him so cavalierly, but that I perceive him to be nearly spoiled by over-praise; my over fastidiousness I am not inclined to deny, and so I should hope a fair estimate may be made of his merit. It is just to add, that he is very correct and very assiduous in his new parts. “Juvat me hoc tribuisse.” jumps and prates, And mutters and extravagates; But then it equally as true is That Mr. J?s! you are not Lewis. Lewis, Pope, and some others, feeling the absolute necessity of some portion of literature in the composition of a good player, took very considerable trouble in this regard, even after they had been some time on the stage; yet neither of them had been a mere mechanic.—Whilst Mr. J?s should be studying his profession, he is seen walking up and down Damestreet, canvassing salutes from every well dressed man, who will condescend to nod to him: “Good den, Sir Richard,—Gad a mercy, fellow.” Perennial H?ch?ck now appears, Victorious o'er the frost of years; Fresh flowers adorn her latest days, A kind of thespian aloes.— Blest in each walk of social life, Unwrung by care, unvexed by strife; With placid mind and temperate soul She sees old Time innoxions roll, And from his favouring pinions shed Age unoppressive o'er her head. Her acting not unlike her fate, Nor meanly low, nor brightly great, She walks the stage's middle course Without or feebleness or force; And whatsoe'er she act, our eyes No faults offend, or powers surprize. But, let me own, that were she blessed With talents, such as Pope Miss Pope. Le dernier rejetton of the old school, the pupil of the Garricks, the imitator of the Clives, and the best actress that the men of our day ever have seen, or perhaps ever will see. Those who have had the happiness to see her Mrs. Heidleberg with King's Lord Ogleby, and Wewitzers Canton, in the Clandestine Marriage, may form an opinion of “how plays should be acted.” possessed, They should not take a greater scope, Or strive to figure more than Pope. And must we grieve to see her play Every This is by no means the result of a mis-timed vanity in Mrs. H?ch?ck; it is the necessary consequence of the miserable deficiency of good actresses, with which our drama is afflicted.—The public is rather under obligations to Mrs. H?ch?ck, for the readiness with which she undertakes every thing that she thinks can conduce to their entertainment. The variety of parts she is obliged by the poverty of the company to study and play, must be very distressing to a person of her age and situation— Nil parcunt Seni Si quæ laborissa est, ad cam curritur Sin lenis est, ad aliam defertur. Ter. prol. in Heautontim. part and every day, The young, the old, coquette, or prude, Polished dame, or housewife rude— Till surfeited at last, we feel The truth of “la pâté d'anguille.” Setting out of the question the absurdity of seeing an old woman (whatever be her vigor and talents) playing girlish parts, I must confess that in theatrical matters “diversité (not novelty, take notice) est ma devise.” La Fontaine, La Pâté d'anguille. Next W?ll?ms This man plays seconderate characters, with fourth rate abilities—Some of his sailors are very well; and of this he is so satisfied, that knowing where his talent lies, he turns all his parts into sailors. His Crabtree, his Job Thornberry, his Ibrahim, are dismal instances of this amphibious merit. comes the rude and rough, With face most whimsically gruff, Aping the careless sons of ocean, He scorns each fine and easy motion; Tight to his sides his elbow pins, ? Vidi ego civis Retorta tergo brachia. But the friends of freedom will rejoice to hear, that Mr. W?ll?ms, at the instigation of this passage, has of late given his elbows more liberty, than those unhappy captives hitherto enjoyed. And dabbles with his hands like fins; Would he display the greatest woe, He slaps his breast, and points his toe; Is merriment to be expressed, He points his toe and slaps his breast. His turns are swings,—his step a jump, His feelings fits,—his touch a thump; And violent in all his parts, He speaks by gusts, and moves by starts. And lo! his wife, whose every feature; Foretells the talent of the creature; Lively and vulgar, low and pert She plays, au vif, the peasant flirt, And hits, without the slightest aid From Art, the saucy chamber-maid. Format enim natura prius nos intus ad omnem Fortunarum habitum— I am sure nature never intended Mrs. W?ll?ms for a fine lady, or even for a fine gentleman, a character she sometimes attempts. It is really disgraceful, that there should be no actress on the Dublin stage, capable of playing the well bred female characters of our best plays; poor Mrs. W?ll?ms is obliged to give up a line of acting in which she is very respectable, to stop by the most ridiculous efforts, the gaps of the company—this is a heavy misfortune to the audience, but, “en revanche,” 'tis a great saving to the managers—good actresses demand good salaries, and Mrs. W?ll?ms is so much clear gain— “Intereà gustus elementa per omnia quærunt “Nunquam animo pretiis obstantibus.” Oh! gustus and actresses are very different things to a man of taste.— Oh! could a little sense controul The flights of her aspiring soul;— Could she be satisfied with all The glories of the servants'-hall, Nor e'er with daring steps presume To figure in the drawing room;— Could she but wisely be content With Mincing and not Millamant, And following nature's humble course, Decline Bisarre and play Lamorce, None would have guessed that she had ne'er Observed what life and manners were, Nor ever known a circle higher Than that around the green-room fire. 'Tis shame to offer to the view, This kind of “paysanne parvenue” This Nell in lady's robes arrayed, This hash of mistress and of maid. And yet not all the blame attaches To her,—she naturally snatches, At spangled gowns, and caps of lace, To mend her figure and her face— But why this travesty permitted? Because we've no one better fitted; And thus in utter disregard Of right or wrong, our plays are marred; An useful actress is disgraced, And insult braves the public taste. FOURTH EPISTLE. ? tragœdus Sub nutrice, velut si luderit insans. Hor. Epis. ad Aug. Hush!

This folly of exhibiting children, is not quite modern. “There is, Sir,” says Rosincrantz to Hamlet “an aiery of young children little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for it.—These are now the fashion”—but I believe it never was, before this year, the fashion to introduce one infant to play the first characters among men and women—oh!

Now clapping hands, and loud huzzas Thunder the rapture of applause, The very walls are rocked and why— The hero's only four feet high! The noise redoubles,—we are told The hero's only twelve years old! But oh! what language could we find, The raptures of the critic mind To tell, could we our Douglas Though I only take notice of this part, it is meet to set it down, that the infant played Romeo to Mrs. Kni?ton's Juliet, and that they looked like an overgrown girl and her doll.

And is this then the wond'rous bait For loud applause and houses great, The Roscius, This was the modest title under which the “little eyase,” was announced “ad captandum vulgus,” and it did its office with a vengeance. I heard some of my brethren of the pit discoursing, “who this Roscius could be;” one learned gentleman asserted, that it was one Garrick's christian name; but the general opinion seemed to be, that he was a French actor, who had been guillotined in the early days of the revolution. Those critics I observed to be particularly loud and judicious in their applauses, as might be supposed. this whose radiance bright, Should dim the ineffectual light Of all the glow-worms of the stage, Of every size and every age?— An infant Children have ever been an engine of pity and pardon; ?

I have given, perhaps, to Beatty more than his share of attention, but I shall not lament my trouble, if I should have any influence in dissuading him from persisting, at present, in his dramatic pursuits, and in restoring him to the lessons of his masters 'till he can say with the son of Ulysses:— ? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ??. ??? ?? ??? ?? ????? ????, ??? ????? ????? ?????? ??????????, ??? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? ?????, ???????.?

But sad reverse—the face and form Which art might animate and warm, You clearly shew in every part, Have never known the care of art.

Singers have ever been remarked for their capriciousness, but even he whom Horace ridicules for that folly, did not, as would seem, presume to carry it farther than his own private circle. “Omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribus, inter amicos Ut nunquam inducant animum cantare rogati.” Tigellius would never, I dare swear, disappoint the public. Poor Mr. Phi?ps, who, like other fine gentlemen, is rather nervous, has been prodigiously disconcerted at this mention of him; but to do him justice, I think he will take care not to deserve a repetition of my notice, and that I shall have the pleasure of reclaiming him from lounging Dame-street, and founding clubs.

Co?e and Li?say, who, I suppose, declined the character also. I should have been much pleased to have seen either of those latter gentlemen attempt it, “it would be argument for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.” But if you give the part of Braham, Perhaps he'll condescend to play 'em; Or if you beg it, will attack a Bravura, Arriette, Polacca, But to sing every common air, Is more than gentlemen Mr. Phi?ips, I am told, piques himself on being much of a gentleman, I am exceedingly glad of it; and as it is now become quite vulgar to be indisposed, we hope he will get entirely well of those sudden and periodic colds that so often affect him, and deprive us of the pleasure of hearing him.

Sly mirth, and impotence of rage, He's still, tho' often harsh and mean, The evenest actor of our scene. Hargrave I was much perplexed in forming an opinion of Mr. Hargrave's dramatic merit, as he is really one of the most uneven actors I ever saw. Had his private character been the subject of consideration, I should not have hesitated a moment to say, that it is one of the most respectable I have heard of. the modest and the meek, With humble blushes clothes his cheek; Seems scarcely bold enough to raise His eyes indifferent of praise, And with demeanour mildly proud, Retires in silence from the crowd. To him, indeed, one vainly looks For Kemble's rival, or for Cooke's, Yet oft he glads the critic eyes With gleams from talent's purest skies; And draws the tear, and melts the heart By careless strokes of happiest art; Oh! si sic omnia,—but alas! Those gleams like winter's sunshine pass. He seems to think a smiling face And upright posture a disgrace, And therefore labours to present His visage cross, his body bent— As if his sense perceived around, Unsavoury smell, or dismal sound. And thus we're left to wonder still Who plays so well, should play so ill. What fair ones next advance in rank, Davis I had much to say of this lady, but at this moment praise would be lost to her, and censure would be cruel— The time which has elapsed since the first note was written, might perhaps authorize a little explanation at present, but I am charitable, and shall say nothing. plump, and Stuart lank— O'er Davis, let us draw the veil, Nor touch, e'er wounds have time to heal.

Her. Oet. Her beauty (if it can be so called) is common to our eyes, and worn so threadbare, that it no longer covers her multitude of sins; and her liveliness she has completely lost with her pucellage—far be it from me, to guess whence the alteration proceeds; but it is visible and really afflicting. ‘Omne animal’—the proverb is somewhat musty— She was a tolerable Ariel, and was admired in some other light characters—but at this moment she is fit for nothing, but bearing Juliet's or Ophelia's pall. too, has claims for grace; Inveterate wedlock in her face, Pleads with more eloquence for pity Than all the preachers Melius Chrysippo et Crantore, dicit. of the city: Poor girl! sufficient torments teize you, I will not blame, and cannot praise you.— What dreadful sounds assail my ear, Are all the coffin-makers here?

C?ke The never-sufficiently-to-be-extolled leader of the band, whom I have so often mentioned—it occurs to me, that he committed the dissonance alluded to; that, from doing so much in one evening, he might have leave ever after to retire at the end of the fourth act of the play, and abandon the ballet and farces to the guidance of his underlings.—Messrs. Salomon, Weischel, Cramer, or Shaw, who are, in some degree, Mr. C?ke's equals, never presumed to take such liberty; and I beg Mr. C?ke will consider whether it is decorous or respectful to the Public or his Employer. play eight instruments together, Or croaking frogs foretell wet weather? Or is it Li?say's This person is the only actor of Irish characters, now on the Irish stage, and the last we had was a Welchman. This is one of our practical bulls.—Li?say is, however, not only the Denis Brulgruddery, and the Sir Lucius O'Trigger of Dublin, but is also, poor man! one of our principal vocal performers. Mr. C?yne enacts the dignified and elegant Sir Philip Blandford, and the plain Steadfast, and even sometimes the mad Octavian; but he nevertheless condescends to officiate “invito Apollone,” as one of the tuneful train.

Is there no follower of Russel's, No friend to democratic bustles, No writer of the Northern Star, No poet of Marengo's war, No rival of O'Quigly's fame, No hater of the regal name, To free the drama from a thing So useless and so dull as K?g. This person, who might truly be called king of the Gypsies, is an unlucky poor creature, whom the Managers continually expose to the derision of the Public, in the characters of lovers, heroes, and fine gentlemen. Horace's jest is much to the same purpose: ? Per magnes, Brute, deos te Oro qui Reges consuesti tollere cur non Hunc Regem jugulas? operum hoc, mihi crede, tuorum est. And now comes every nameless name, One person however, not especially mentioned, I must distinguish from this general judgment.—Mr. Waylett—of whom I have seen too little to be able to applaud him, and too much to pass him over in utter silence. He played Sir Oliver Surface one night, with a plain simplicity and ease, that made a very favourable impression—I hope it may not be defaced. The Public torture and the shame, Who nightly as the curtains rise Offend our ears and scare our eyes; Kings, footmen, senators and hags In ermine, livery, or rags.

I exceedingly lament the foolim and indecent style of oratory, which so often makes the sacred chair, the “tinsel throne of glittering nonsense;” the serious disposition of thought which our admirable church-service is so calculated to inspire, is either put to shame or to flight, by the wild and feigned declamation which, as a critic, I despise, and as a Christian detest. I would recommend it to those reverend young Poets, to indulge their taste for the Muses, in reading Cowper's description of a petit-maitre clergyman, and to recollect the advice of Boileau: Et, fabuleux chrétiens, n'allons point, dans nos songes, Du Dieu de vérité fair un Dieu de mensonges.

Those gentlemen seem to possess the power, that Mercury, in Plautus, humourously ascribes to himself, when he observed the Spectators vexed (as modern Audiences often are) at finding their comedy was in truth a tragedy:— Quid contraxistis frontem? quia tragœdium Dixi futuram hanc, Deus sum, commeutavero Eadam hanc si vultis faciam ex tragœdia Comœdia?

Style, p. 59. Every one who is acquainted with German literature, well knows that not one of their dramas (Germania quos horrida parturit Fœtus) deserves to be excepted from this general censure. The English reader I refer to all the plays of Schiller and Kotzebue, which have been translated into our language. He will not find one piece undisgraced by vice or folly: some indeed excel in folly, others in vice, but in general “they are as like one another as half-pence, each seeming monstrous 'till its fellow come to match it.” As you like it. that offer ranting “For spirit, and for pathos canting, “Blustering for sorrow, oaths for sighs, “For vigour, rage and blasphemies: “Where passions either creep or fly, “Meanly low, or madly high, “And bedlam-nature stalks What would Longinus have thought of such passion and sublimity, as the following passages (taken at random from Schiller) exhibit: “Now let the storm rage, tho' it should swell me up to the throat” Robbers. “O.

The three female singers, Misses Howells and Davidson, and Mrs. Stewart, are on every account incapable of playing even secondary parts, and indeed seem to me to be only fit to lengthen the procession in Alphonso, or swell the choruses of the Castle Spectre. We have no professed male singer but Mr. Phillips, and thus the whole of our musical department depends on his slender pipe. Now as it happens that, from some cause or other, this gentleman cannot conveniently play all the parts, both male and female, of an opera on one night, it is evident that it were unreasonable to expect any musical entertainment at the Dublin theatre. But that we should not have to complain of a total want of this species of amusement, recourse has been had to a most brilliant expedient, which for its singular ingenuity, I shall relate in detail: Some one had heard, that a distressed country company had once played Hamlet with the omission of Hamlet's character, and it therefore occurred to them, that a musical entertainment, with the music omitted, would be in the present posture of affairs the most satisfactory extrication which could be devised.—The scheme was, it seems, adopted, and the Battle of Hexham had the honor to be selected for the experiment. The aforesaid Misses H. and D. were to sing all the choruses, and Mr. Phillips's name appeared in the front of the bills as principal in the glees. Night after night did Mr. Phillips's non-appearance disappoint the weary audiences, 'till at last Messrs. Jeffery and Dyke, who usually enact waiters, senators, and such folk, kindly consented to make themselves ridiculous, by singing the first and bass parts in such time and tune, as it should please God. So far all was prosperous. But here another unforeseen accident occurred, for it was by some means or other discovered, that the first and third would be useless without a second. Necessity, says the Proverb, is the mother of invention, and necessity took a violon-cello-teacher, dressed him in a fine brown jerkin, equipped him by the assistance of a burned cork with most terrific moustachios, and finally turned him out upon the stage a finished second, in whom nothing was forgotten or omitted, but a voice to sing—and after this manner the musical drama of the Battle of Hexham was said and sung by his Majesty's servants!!! “ex uno disce omnes.” I find from the admonitions of the Kitchen-stuff Gazette, that I have been, in the foregoing note, guilty of a most wicked and diabolical mistake, by inserting the name of Mr. Dyke, instead of that of Mr. Denman, who really sung the third, and who, to use Taratalla's own words, “is one of the best and most scientific bass singers living, on or off the stage”—“O Terque quaterque beatus! I am ‘au desespoir’ at the disgrace into which this error has thrown me; Dyke or Denman, Denman or Dyke, I beg pardon of either, of both, or neither of the gentlemen, as they please; I have an equal respect for each, and tho' I have not the happiness of their acquaintance, they are, I am ready to believe “? arcades ambo “Et cantare pares ?” while Mistyllus and Taratalla are the respondere parati.” where lovers come “To dulcet sound of bass Pausanias, in his account of the Cadmean family, (Bœot. c. 5.) says, that Harmony was the daughter of Mars and Venus.

Of Philemon, the Kotzebue of his day, we only know, that he was the rival and conqueror of Menander, who, with the amiable frankness and honest confidence of Genius, asked his successful competitor—“Quæso Philemo bona venia dic mihi quum me vinces non crubescis?—” A.G.

I own I should be better pleased that the stage was not made absolutely a dancing school, and a place of practice for embryo Parisots; but as the children are always neatly dressed, and generally contrive to keep time, in the present state of the scenic art, we have no reason to complain.—Let me add a strange anecdote which I have heard, tho' I can hardly believe:—A person with a very good sounding honest Irish name, something like M'Donough, or M'Swiney, or O'Flanagan, was desirous of setting up in this city as a dancing master, and obtaining an engagement as ballet dancer at the Theatre—“What, with such a name?” impossible! my good friend, go, go and get another.”—The Milesian was wise enough to take the hint, and Signior (I shall not mention his new appellation) afterwaads danced ‘mutato nomine’ with great success at Crow-street, and now teaches, as I am told, in the highest circles in Dublin. that only please at one sense— Trash that usurps the comic name, Mad farce and maudlin melodrame. Throw off the trammels of the mode, A shifting yet a ponderous load; Nor let your native sense and taste By others follies be disgraced, Catch timid merit as it springs, Give to your Mr. Jones's liberality is a favourite topic of expatiation amongst his friends, and I believe not unjustly; but I intreat him to exercise it in procuring a few good Players for the Theatre Royal, an expedient of generosity which he has not yet practised to any considerable extent. liberal soul full wings, The stages golden age restore, And Censure shall return no more. Gentle Reader who hast travelled these six heavy stages thro' with me, accept my thanks for the patience, with which you have borne the roughness of the road, and the mistakes and wanderings of our course, “beggar that I am, I'm poor even in thanks,” and have no other reward to offer, than, that I assure you, I shall not again trespass on your kindness and good nature—valete, and if you can plaudite. I at this moment, when my Printer is going to shut up his Press, learn from one of the newspapers, that the mimæ and balatrones are about to publish answers to these Epistles.—Who the disinterested champions of the Manager's propriety, and his servants talents are; whether in prose ‘Respondere parant sue condunt amabile carmen,’ I have no means of knowing, nor reason for caring. I am not desirous of controversy; but if any further exertion in the defence of common sense, decency, and the drama, should become necessary, I shall, perhaps, request the Public indulgence for a continuation of these Epistles; but if, on the contrary, I find that the Patentee and the actors persevere in admitting the justice of my remaks, by a renunciation of the errors which occasioned them, I shall calmly bear in triumphant silence, all the efforts of Kitchenstuff Answerers and Gazetteers. Saturday, March 24, 1804. POSTSCRIPT. My business does not permit me to bestow my time so totally on this little Book, as to enable me to say, that this second Edition contains no typical or substantial errors: but I have exerted all convenient diligence, in making it correct both in matter and form—In both perhaps, I have failed, yet I should hope that I may be permitted to say, Sunt bona sunt quædam mediocria sunt mala plura Quæ legis, hic aliter nonfit, avite liber.
