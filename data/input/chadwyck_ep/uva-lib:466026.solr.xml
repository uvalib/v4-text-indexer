      <field name="fulltext">[The leaves which in the autumn of the years] The leaves which in the autumn of the years Fall auburn-tinted from their parent trees, Swept from dismembered boughs by ruthless breese, Through Winter's weary reign of want and fears Will lie in drifts; and when the snowdrop cheers— Frail firstling of the flowers—they still are there, There still, although the balmy southern air And budding boughs proclaim that Spring appcars. So lost hopes severed by the stress of life Unburied lie before our wistful eyes, Though none but we regard their fell dccay; And ever amid the stir of worldly strife Fresh aims and fuller purposes arise Between the faded hopes of yesterday. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. THE RIVER OF THOUGHT. The strong River of Thought has an ayechangeful course, Yet for ever it springs from the same changeless source Where God-given Truth in its grandeur doth reign, The regal physician of Man's mental pain. Sometimes in high joyance it glideth along With glamour of music and gladness of song:— While borne on its bosom gay pleasure-boats sail, Rejoicing a while in the light laughing gale. Sometimes like the stream which has sunk under ground, Yet still keeps its course mid the darkness profound, Unknown and alone it must hold on its way, Till emerging at length in the full light of day. Sometimes like the mountain's fierce torrent it flows, And all that can hinder its progress o'erthrows;— Possessing the power of immutable right, And strong in the strength of invincible might. Crass Ignorance surely succumbs to its sway, As boldly it takes its all-conquering way,— While keen-sighted Knowledge appears in its train, The sweetener of pleasure, the soother of pain. Unceasingly hated by many, yet some Unceasingly love it, though oft they are dumb. Yet whatever betides, and wherever it flows, 'Tis the noble who love it, the weak who oppose Great River of Thought! our strange world doth not know The evil you check, and the good you bestow:— May Time teach the lesson, 'twill then comprehend How well and how often you prove its true friend. WHISPERING WINDS. Whispering winds strange musings carry To our hearts as they sweep by:— Thoughts that often thrilling tarry Though the winds may wailing die. To the sailor, watchful pacing On the deck of ship at sea, Bring they dreams of danger facing, Mid the tempest's mockery. To the exile, hoping, fearing, Wandering on an alien strand, Bring they memories endearing Of his much-loved Father-land. To the weary heavy-hearted Often bring they thoughts of peace, Of the peace where, pain departed, Woe and weariness shall cease. Sometimes bring they only sorrow To the stricken in their train, Imaging a dread to-morrow Which will but augment their pain. Bring they unto some new pleasure And each trace of care destroy, While to others yield a measure Of distress that mars their joy. Yet these forms of varied feeling In this feature all agree, That o'er every soul is stealing Thought of an Eternity. HELPFULNESS. Behold a fine tree growing in a field, Apart from any other, and alone, With nothing to preserve it or to shield It from the wind, yet it is ever known To thrive as well as trees whose lot is thrown In sheltered woods, saved from the wintry blast. And first from it in spring is heard the tone Of singing birds; for, while its branches last, It is a blessing where its lonely lot is cast. How well if often thus with man it were, For surely cheering others on their way Would wondrously relieve our ceaseless care, And dissipate the gloom of Life's drear day, By teaching us that Love will truly pay An hundredfold again what we bestow Upon our brother toilers; none can say The blessings that we reap when thus we show Our sympathy for men by sharing in their woe. THE SOURCE OF SONG. What maketh the true poet sing? Is it sense of deep injuries thrown On the weak by the strong, which sting His heart, till to song he is prone? Is it sight of some beautiful lake All aflame with the dying sun's rays,— O'er whose breast the acacias shake Soft tresses of feathery sprays? Is it thought of some beautiful form That fays well might deign to assume; Displaying with ardour full warm, How noble is youth's early bloom? Is it thought of his dear mother-land,— The deep longing that she be supreme: Aspiration as loyal as grand, Which to sons should be more than a dream? Is it pleasure in physical health— The supreme unacquirable dower, Far greater in blessing than wealth, And almost as mighty in power? Is it simple desire to excel? Or ambition that's highest and best, Which longs among mankind to dwell, To show by true life what is blest? With such things the poet must strive, And sometimes they impel him to sing, Till in fortunate hour they may drive Him for aid to re-touch his lute's string. But the primary cause which impels,— More resistless than aught of these things,— Is this: that within him there dwells A soul which but lives when he sings. A STORM SONG. The surges in anger are beating On the rocks and the shingle-strewn shore, And though with a hiss aye retreating, They come in fierce fury once more. Most sternly the billows are breaking In wreaths white with purest of spray,— Still further their great wrath awaking, As forward they dash on their way. The wild wailing wind that is blowing, The dreariness far out to sea, The feelings that come without knowing In truth what their nature may be. All these, and much more now oppress me As musing I gaze on the strand:— Yet though in some sense it distress me, How noble a storm is,—how grand! The ships in the bay are so swaying, Their cables can scarce bear the strain:— Their beams with the water are playing While sailing is utterly vain As the gale is against them completely; The rain how it ceaselessly falls, Clouds scud o'er the sky, ah how fleetly! And harsh are the sea-birds' shrill calls. The storm is now spent and departed And yet its effects still remain,— Two mothers are made broken-hearted, Their boys will not greet them again. How wondrous it is that Creation Is aye in perpetual strife, And shows not, for man's emulation, How calmness should regulate life! Can it be that when Man in his madness To Evil at first became thrall, All Nature was forced with sore sadness To join his unspeakable fall? A SONG FOR POLAND IN 1878. Ah, how cruel the thraldom and bitter the bonds Of our wretched and down-trodden nation! Not a throb of our hearts but in anguish responds To the sight of such dire desolation: And in scarce-spoken words we are heard to declare Woe hath made us wellnigh broken-hearted, Dark and dreary the prospect; dear Poland, despair, Since thy liberty now hath departed. Other peoples get freedom, while we in the dust Alone and forsaken are lying; Ever lower and lower continually thrust, Men's love of their country fast dying. While the Government check with malicious intent Any change for our good which is started. Dark and dreary the prospect; let Poland lament, Since her liberty's light hath departed! No! Revenge on the tyrants who work us such ill Mid their bland hypocritical prating:— And arouse ye, undaunted, remembering that still Retribution is certainly waiting. Let our nation awake which now slumbering lies! Not a moment be longer down-hearted! For rejoicing may come if proud Poland arise, And her freedom return which departed. WHAT ALL MAY DO. Our past life must perish, Our future arise, And oft what we cherish Most speedily dies:— There are griefs for whose changing We helplessly long, Though we feel our arranging Is hopelessly wrong:— But if we live rightly, We have in our power To gather up brightly, From each fading hour, A thought-woven treasure Of justly-earned joy, Whose bountiful measure No grief can destroy. REWARD OF PARLIAMENTARY DOCILITY. A Brother to a Sister. My dear— As words though sincere, Are at best but ‘small beer,’ My party (in office) have made me a peer: A step which the press I do hope won't deem queer, Nor question its justice, not slightingly sneer, (What I've done to deserve it is not very clear, Save doing as bid, when divisions were near— Thus causing our Whip's drooping spirits to cheer,) But be that as it may, I subscribe myself here John Anthony Snobbins, (now) Lord Abinmere. SONNETS ON THE POWER OF THOUGHT. In Converse. Who can predict what power for distant days Toward good or ill lies centred in a Thought Which flashing through the mind unmeant, unsought, Is uttered suddenly in careless phrase? Ill that no future good can stingless make In the effects wrought by its blighting force;— Great good that floweth from the all-good Source, The Fount from which all purity we take. Sometimes thought's mighty aims in secret lurk And labour silently, their aim concealed, Until the crisis comes; sometimes revealed They zealously pursue their varied work. Reflecting wisely thus may we be taught Not rashly to express each flippant thought. In Writing. If so it be with speech, how much the more With written language! Speech perforce decays, 'Neath Time's destroying touch. Ere many days Gone is mayhap the fruit which wise words bore: That written doth remain,—its import not Dependent on frail Memory's brittle thread To keep it safe, or number with the dead At her capricious will. None can say what Momentous destiny may be assigned To some brief trivial letter. Authors too Who lightly pen, to please the public view, Works strenuous and yet stained with vice, will find A day of certain retribution come When all their loud excuses will be dumb. In Art. The power of Thought in art! Who has not found And marked its subtle influence? We see Its magic in a picture wondrously, Whose canvas by its presence made renowned Bears witness to the fact. When we behold A stately building, and perceive the skill Which shapes each column at the sculptor's will Till it attains at length th' exquisite mould That he has long desired. When we are thrilled By some soft cadence rippling on the ear Of sweetest music,—as though far and near With a celestial choir the air were filled:— Then, and then always, may we truly find What power of thought lies in the human mind! In Proverbs, &amp;c. The power of Thought in Proverbs!—oftentimes We find its glittering essence centred there, All crystallized, as if indeed it were A bright and flawless diamond.—Silly Rhymes Which oft we hear repeated are not dross Entirely,—here and there rare pearls of thought Appear upon their surface, genius-wrought; Had they not been, we must have borne a loss. O mighty power of Thought, it may not be Within the sphere of any man to find Thought undiscovered by a brother-mind, Though deep and boundless is thy shoreless sea:— And yet thy potent pathway is the groove In which, by thee propelled, the change-girt world doth move. IN MEMORY OF The gallant men who fell fighting at Isandhlwana, South Africa, in a surprise by the Zulus, 23d January 1879. Steadfast they stood,—nor feared to face the foe Though twenty-fold outnumbered,—calm, alone They bore the brunt of battle on them thrown, And bravely strove against the ignoble blow: Yet doubtless mid the din of deadly strife Came softened thoughts of home and loved ones dear: And many a prayer was prayed in faith sincere That they might meet anew in deathless life. We mourn their loss (a wound Time scarce can heal)— Yet we are proud such courage doth remain Among us. May we soon efface the stain From England's flag,—while more and more we feel A sense of joy, which in our hearts will stay, That Britain still can boast these ‘heroes of to-day.’ Feb. 22d, 1879. VIOLET. ‘A tale of sorrow’? Ay, I know, One fraught with sharp and sudden woe, A story of undoubted truth, Beclouding all my sunny youth; And though with arbitrary sway Stern Time has turned my locks to grey, Though furrowed wrinkles on my brow Proclaim that I am agèd now, Though signs of trouble you may trace In the expression of my face,— Though trembling is my bloodless hand, And scarcely under due command, Though devious is my tottering tread, Though bent with weight of years my head; Though my whole look, my gait, my air, Show sad though common signs of care, Yet fadeless, unforgotten, clear, To mental sight its scenes appear. Of sisters I had only one As playmate,—brothers I had none. A lovely rose-lipped child was she, Dear as my very life to me; Now, almost mournful in their birth, Rise thoughts of these dead days of mirth; I see her framing daisy-chains While I assist, and for my pains Receiving, as repayment meet, The chaplet from her when complete. And as o'er both the restless years Resistless rolled their hopes and fears, They only bound us by a bond More durable and just as fond. O happy he who thus hath known Such union ere his lot was thrown Amid the changes and the strife And heart-wounds of the world's strange life! Even dreams of such communion to the bruised and wearied soul, Are ever found the truest balm to make it strong and whole. Yes: years rolled on, with little change For us in Duty's daily range. My sister—Violet her name,— In beauty grown, remained the same In character. Her guileless grace, Almost a proverb in the place, To those she loved exceeding fond, And gentle unto all beyond. Ever for right most firm and strong, Aye valiantly rebuking wrong, And seeking in whatever mood To shun the ill and do the good. Her figure pleasing as her mien, Her summers numbering seventeen; Her rippling hair of darkest hue, Her eyes not oft describèd blue, But some rare tint,—and pen can ne'er Portray the radiance glowing there. There was a youth whom Violet thought Worthy her love, and he had caught A kindred flame of chaste desire; A truer love could none require, Parents and friends were satisfied, And well they might be; all descried That union of such virtuous worth Would prove the happiest on earth. Our lawn stretched to a deep broad stream: On summer eves 'twas like a dream To watch the gentle moonbeams play Across its wide and glittering way; To trace the tremor of the trees Slow moving in the soft night breeze, And as on either side they bend Each towards the other as a friend Talking with comrade dear,—to think These trees, converse they, on this river's brink? On the stream's tide we kept a boat, Not often did it idly float In peace near to the summer shore; For one alone could ply its oar With pleasure. In the sultry noon, With bees and birds and trees in tune, How sweet to glide in it, and screen 'Neath willows from the scorching sheen; Thus Violet full oft had been. And so one day—the heat was great, And, we conjecture, to abate Its force, she to the water dipped To lave her hands,—in quickly slipped The boat's light oar; that then she tried To reach it, bending on one side,— Till gone too far to stay, 'twould seem, She slid into the treacherous stream. Too late an oarless boat was found, And near, a maiden, soul-less, drowned, In whose fair face and gloomless mien Death in his gentlest form was seen. One lover more o'erwhelmed with grief, Whose tears as yet brought no relief, Who, righteous and untouched by guile, Ne'er sought another maiden's smile; A brother who through all his coming years Will strive to dry his brethren's bitter tears. ‘A common story, this,’ I hear one say,— ‘Not worth the telling.’ Nay, stern critic, nay; Each man's heart-tragedy, if truly told, Will interest some, although to most 'tis cold And commonplace. No case of mental pain Which crushes not, but strengthens, can be vain. HEART ECHOES. While the sunlight's glory dying Tints the pebbly sea-kissed strand, And the night-chilled breezes sighing, See the shadows wrap the land— Faint, yet powerful, sad, yet tender, Come fond thoughts of vanished years, Waking sweet soul-thrills that render Joy that is akin to tears. Ah, how real are these dreams! And the past the present seems. Visions of a gentle maiden Beautiful and pure as fair, And of eves whose gales love-laden Wanton with her auburn hair; For 'twas when soft summer's beauty Made the earth with gladness rife First I felt, as well as duty, What deep joy might be in life: Ah, how real are these dreams! And the past the present seems. Memories are swiftly thronging Of that span of treasured past, When the joy to me belonging Was, alas! too bright to last: Still do I remember clearly What I asked with trembling voice, And her words, ‘I love you dearly, And am proud to be your choice.’ Ah, how real are these dreams! And the past the present seems. We were ‘wedded, happy-hearted,’ And our future path seemed bright, Who could tell we should be parted, Love's glad sun obscured in night? Yet before another spring-tide Shed abroad its myriad charms, Bitter blow! my darling left me,— Dying calmly in my arms. Ah, how real, fraught with woe, Rise these dreams of long ago! Still amid my sore dejection, In its comfort ever new, Comes the soothing, sweet reflection, To each other we were true. For some end God sendeth sorrow, And when this at length is gained I shall meet my bride in Heaven Happy, holy, and unstained. There no longer fraught with woe Rise the dreams of long ago. THE POET'S POWERLESSNESS. Unto the poet's mental eye how clear Appears a scene he would in wise words weave Into the varied texture of his verse! A scene it is of beauty unsurpassed,— Of hoary mountains whose gigantic peaks Approach the sky,—of a fair wooded vale,— And of a rushing rivulet, whose sound Re-echoes in his ears. A simple theme Methinks to handle, yet at once he finds How hard it is to choose the magic words With which to make the spell he trusts will bind The senses of his readers. Ever thus He feels it in description,—also when Depicting subtle feelings of the soul,— Indeed in every subject meet for song:— And so he feels that words are at the best Most ineffective colours to paint well A theme Imagination-glorified. THE OMNIPRESENCE OF POETRY. There's poetry in everything, If poets could but find How best its subtle power to bring To breathe upon the mind. It lurks in all of Nature's store, Alike on land and main,— Where far from shore the breakers roar, And on the quiet plain. 'Mid lofty mountains whose proud peaks Appear to pierce the sky,— In valleys where the farmer seeks His busy tasks to ply. 'Mid scenes where babbling brooklets haste, Engirt with flowery strand; Where man's harsh turmoil makes a waste Of erst a beauteous land In mighty cities never dumb With sounds of human life, In villages where seldom come Cares born of human strife. 'Mid friends and kindred everywhere, In talks with those we love When happy intercourse we share;— In thoughts of things above. Enwove with every feeling here, Part of each joy and pain, And permeating love sincere Which never can be vain. For Poetry's white hands can mould, From all of Earth, pure leaven;— And who shall say it will not hold A noble place in Heaven! FRAGMENT FOR MUSIC. Softly swaying Are the flowers, Scents betraying 'Mid the showers: Gently moving Are the trees, Not reproving The rude breeze. Stars shine quiet Though the storm's Cloudlets riot O'er their forms: Moonrays mildly Shed their light, Though still wildly Wails the night. Mountains never In their might Care if ever Lost to sight: Plants must wither And be lost When comes thither Biting frost. Lower creatures Scarce complain, Nor their features Change with pain; Though Toil's burden Ne'er is done, Though no guerdon Can be won. At each season Man makes moan Though glad reason Is his own;— Notwithstanding In his might Earth commanding, Wrong or right. AN EVENING LANDSCAPE. The sun has set, and shades of evening close, And all around there reigns profound repose; And not a sound is heard, save when the breeze In fitful gusts comes rustling through the trees; And with its facile force their branches sways, Like spectres moving in the moon's faint rays. Ah, little change the face of nature knows, Compared with life's oft-changing joys and woes, And while poor, puny man departs as fast As smoke is scattered by the wintry blast; Its aspect will continue as of yore, Till God decrees that Time shall be no more. THE GUERDON OF TRIBULATION NOT INCURRED BY GUILT. Oh say not that the world is sad Without redeeming feature, Oh say not that the world is glad And holds no hopeless creature. No life is ever filled with woe However great its sadness, No lot can be all joy, although Most glorious seems its gladness. With endless grief Life is not fraught, Nor with all bliss and beauty, By varied influence we are taught How to fulfil our duty. If happy be our lot assigned, Of sorrow slight our burden, Yet work on still with steadfast mind Assured shall be our guerdon: But a crown more rich to those shall be From pain much less exempted, If conquering the same foes as we, Although more sorely tempted. Thus every woe our souls within, Though stern its present sadness, If meekly borne, nor caused by sin, Augments our future gladness. THE TRUE TREASURE. Living brings us bitter sorrow, Oft our hearts refuse submission, While we yearn for a to-morrow Which shall change our dark condition. Love may bring us bitter sadness When we find our love can never More impart the sense of gladness Which we thought it would for ever. Joy may bring us bitter trouble, Faith give place to Falsehood's anguish, Hope may prove an empty bubble When bereft of it we languish. Worldly peace may bring us only More of pain and less of quiet,— And departing leave us lonely, Battling in the world's rude riot. Faith in man may bring delusion, Oftentimes, when it has perished, We discover with confusion 'Twas a phantom that we cherished. Trust in God is truest treasure, For of change it holds no leaven,— If we live aright, its measure Makes us holy, worthy Heaven. EDGAR VANNING: A SKETCH. PERSONS. Edgar Vanning.—A young man near the close of a successful University career. Alethea Stanton.—His betrothed. SCENE I. Edgar's college rooms. Edgar seated at a table, holding in his hand an open letter, which informs him that he has succeeded in obtaining a much-coveted University honour.Edgar. Truly a grand—a noble thing is life, And with what joy a young man's life is fraught, When, with a mind matured, a happy heart, And resolution firm, he gazes forth Upon the boundless world! He knows its snares, Its pitfalls, and its quicksands; yet to him 'Tis given to avoid them. He is not A foolish simple boy fired with strange thoughts Of schemes impracticable, which should cure The ills that are the bane of social life In these our modern days. Yet though he feels Not youth's enthusiasm, nor its sense— So all-absorbing that success is sure: Though conscious of his failures and his faults, Though knowing well his many weaknesses,— Yet hath he self-respect, and knoweth too His capabilities;—and hopes, ay, longs By steadfast effort to effect some good, Which shall, however small, still serve to show That all his life hath not been barrenness. But these are stern thoughts—let them pass—there flows The fresh untrammelled blood of buoyant life Full joyous through my veins; my mind is clear, My intellect is cultured, and I hope My heart is happy. I have lately said That life to such is gladness, let me not Belie so recent words. Ay, when I think Of that great love which nestles in my soul, Like a fair darling child of three years old On her fond father's breast:—when it is true That this love hath its guerdon, I should be For ever gladsome: I remember well The retinue of unreturning years And many a day and hour which made them up, Since she, who is my heart's desire, and I Had our first meeting. We were children both— Our parents were firm friends, and we were thrown Often together: and as Dante loved His Beatrice, so I Alethea,— Save that his Beatrice was proudly cold, While my Alethea was meek and kind;— And that as children we ne'er thought of love, Although we loved so young we cannot tell When love at first began. What subtle joy It is to think that we are one in heart, Together soon to tread Life's hardened ways! What peace to me to think—a brief time past— There comes to me a help-meet truly meet, No speaker of sham sentiment, or words Of mawkish weary platitudes, but one Who strengthens me to do the right, who strives To urge me on to goodly deeds and great. O how refreshing oft it is to leave My studies stern, and theories dim and cold, To commune with reality so bright! How sweet to bring at last the rich reward Of lengthened brain-wrought labour, and to say ‘Thy sympathy hath helped me to succeed.’ SCENE II. A quiet summer evening. Alethea standing in a secluded part of the garden of her home adjacent to an old plantation. Time.—A few days before the day fixed for her marriage.Alethea. A few days more! Ah what a change for me, A happy change! O kind few days that bring it— A blissful change! Speed swift bright days that bring it,— A change the sense of which thrills through my soul, And makes it burst its bonds and soar in song. A few days more, a few days more, Ah what a change for me! Then I shall enter through Love's door To full felicity. No more alone to bear one fear, Or have an untold dread, To leave my path, his sweet voice hear And choose his path instead. A few days more, then it will be My duty to obey,— A duty pleasant, joyous, free As warbler's winsome lay. I'll seek to do each fond behest, To merit each fond smile,— I'll strive to make his life more blest His sadness to beguile. He praises oft my sunny hair, And lauds my peach-bloom cheeks,— I would I were far far more fair When thus my dear one speaks. I feel unworthy him, and yet He takes me for his wife,— I'll yield to him—to pay my debt— The service of my life.How calming is this tranquil evening hour Of sylvan solitude! The tall old oaks Near which I stand have seen full many a year, And sheltered many a maiden such as I Beneath their branches, and in future time Will shelter many more. My favourite flower, The white convolvulus, climbs in the hedge In spotless beauty as it used to do In summers long gone by; and as it will, Fanned by the breath of summers yet to come; Nature is all unchanged, and yet to me How changed it seems to-night! Despite my joy A curious sense of sadness steals upon me, When I reflect that guileless happy days Of thoughtless youth are now for ever past, That though life's grandest, highest, gift is mine, A love returned tenfold, yet doubtless too A share of sorrow is appointed me! SCENE III. A dull autumn morning. Alethea at a window looking out on the depressing prospect. Time.—Several months after.Alethea. The blow is softened now by kindly Time, And I can breathe again. On this the day Poor Edgar starts for clearer sunnier skies I first can ponder on these dreary weeks Which lately heavily have passed away. How different from the glad and trustful days I thought they would have proved! When first I heard That he was stricken by a sickness sore, A sickness nigh to death, I scarcely felt Deep sorrow, but a paralysing pain My senses dulled. I had no power to think, And life seemed dead within me; but at length Came slowly back to me the happy thought, Yes—happy even 'mid such grief as mine: My loved one needed help, and oh what joy Was mine to give it, and I almost blessed The form of his distress, that at the least It did not keep me from him. For what woe Unspeakable must be endured by those Whose loved ones have been smitten, and who know That they are suffering helpless and alone, And that the same disease which tortures keeps Apart from them the dear ones whose kind voice And sympathetic touch is their chief stay. If such a case of misery were mine, Contagion's direst mischief I would brave If I could thereby comfort those I love. A chill received when heated and fatigued One day in Summer's youth-time (when the breeze Had Winter's breath still on it) was enough To lay my Edgar low. Physicians came And went, with faces grave and measured tread; The case was serious, they said, and none Could tell the issue. They were clever men Nor meant to be unkind; yet when I saw Them watch his pangs of pain and laboured breathing With interest all professional and cold, It wellnigh made me mad. The crisis came And passed;—the point once turned, he slowly gained A little strength. The cautious doctors said His youth would grapple on the side of life, And he might yet recover. But for him Should be no more of hard and brain-wrought toil Or anxious eager thought:—his life must pass In quiet,—and his winters he must spend For several years abroad. Thus he will leave Chill England's shores to-day. Ah cruel blast And muddy cold grey sky that drives him from me! Oh callous North-wind, couldst thou not restrain Thy blighting force and let my darling live In the same land as I? Life-giving Sun, Oh why dost thou not shine, when, if thou didst, It would rejoice so many yearning hearts! SCENE IV. Early morning. Edgar standing on a balcony enjoying the fresh balmy air and watching the last traces of the sunrise die away in the sky.Edgar. So yesterday was Christmas-day, and yet Such weather joyous and unwinter-like,— In truth such weather as in recent years We northerners but rarely have received In sunless seasons which we summer call Merely from force of custom. Many trees Retain their leaves—and fair it is to see Green leaves at Christmas-time, while gorgeous flowers, Which never bloom in Britain save when placed In houses cramped and stifling with damp heat, Display their beauty in the open air. A few days since I saw—exquisite sight! An avenue of fine camellia plants, And all in fullest flower! and as I looked Up the long vista while the luscious red Commingled in my vision with the white, And as I further gazed upon the scene Of which they were the centre, and drank in Its wondrous loveliness, I felt deep joy That still amid its mingled pain and grief Such sweetness is preserved on earth to soothe And elevate men's thoughts. They who have lived Only in climates where the fickle weather Is changeful as the winds, can never know The bliss of living where, come calm or storm, No blighting blast can reach to wither up Our vital energies and make our life A misery. This is not such a clime As Italy's in winter, where the sun Makes summer as its warm rays penetrate, But in the shade the cutting searching wind Blows keenly from the snowy Apennines; Nor such a clime as that whose azure waves Reflect with dazzling force the Day-king's heat Upon the olive-groves and pine-clad crags Of the gay Riviera;—but whose warmth Dies with the day, and night is damp and cold. Here winds are never cold nor ever harm With treacherous touch the trustful invalid, Who, lured by the soft sunlight, walks abroad. Here balmy night is pleasant and as mild As is the day, while the defiled sea-shore Appears, at least at night, most beautiful Viewed from a distance; and the dotted lights From many a cottage on the lone crag-sides Vie with the stars from out the deep blue sky In forming a fair circlet round the bay Like flashing jewels round the shapely arm Of youth-dowered maid. What were the lines I strung Together, to employ an idle hour? Christmas in the summer sunshine! O how beautiful it seems,— Clothed in gladness are its moments, realising poets' dreams, While its hours pass swiftly from us, how we wish they were for aye, That their bright and buoyant pleasure with its guilelessness might stay. Christmas in the summer sunshine! softly blows the scented breeze And its coming stirs the frondage of the stately staid palm-trees. Calm the noble realm of Ocean, fair the dotted fishing skiffs, And the verdant cactus growing on the gaunt uprising cliffs. All of Flora's cultured beauty freely is revealed to view, And among the vine-clad ridges of sweet wild-flowers not a few, Soft azaleas, rich gardenias, ope their blossoms to the air, With the rose, and trained geranium:—while its wild type too is there. Fitting the moon's glorious radiance for the people as they pass On the eve of merry Christmas, to and from the midnight mass; And for strolling serenaders who invade the silent hours With what doubtless they consider some of music's choicest flowers. Christmas in the summer sunshine! neither snow nor frost are here, Which, though they may charm the healthy, fill the invalid with fear; And in sooth, with dear ones round him, spends he happily the day, Pining not for that loved treasure—his chill home so far away. Yet! 'tis the far away that makes me sad, For distance is indeed a barrier, Let bards say what they will; for though I hope Hale health is coming back, I sometimes feel As though I had not very long to live; And if 'tis so, it seems a cruel fate To have to spend my few remaining days So far away from those my heart holds dear, But chiefly from the one my whole soul loves. SCENE V. A quiet spot in the garden of Edgar's home. Several months afterwards. Edgar and Alethea. Edgar. The doctors think that I shall ne'er be well. They do not say so openly, but still It is not hard to understand the drift Of their calm-spoken diplomatic phrases About ‘much care’ and ‘quiet’ and ‘escape From English winters to the sunny south;’ And when I asked if my complaint were cured, They hesitated, hemmed, then, smiling, said, ‘Alleviated were the better term.’ Ah, it is hard to hear a cruel fate Thus subtly hinted at in civil words And courteous commonplaces, and to have One's hopes annihilated in soft tones, Meant to be pitiful, perchance, but which Seem by their wily softness but to scorn And counterfeit a kindness not heart-felt. 'Tis bitter to reflect my roll of years Will probably be briefer than of those My comrades—and no better men than I (And this when life to me was ever sweet). 'Tis bitter to reflect that theirs may be The bright career of steadfast earnest toil Towards some right worthy goal, which, gained at last, Rewards them with a name, while unto me 'Tis given but to spend in listless calm My few remaining days. But bitterer still It is, that I must loose you now, my love, From cherished vows which we have interchanged. For 'twere not right that I should link your fate With mine as now it is, and bring perchance On others—innocent—the hopeless bane Of cureless sickness which I feel myself. Grief is the rule of this our carthly life, And joy but the exception; wherefore then Should I expect of joy a greater share Than is apportioned unto thousands who Have suffered, still are suffering, or will suffer As helplessly as I:—and surely too My mind should be far calmer than is his Who sowed himself the seeds of his disease, Whose every pang is now intensified By keen remorse, and seething in whose soul No thought save one—the ever-gnawing thought But for himself what he would now have been. Yet oh, Alethea, 'tis crushing grief To lose you, darling, were it not my duty, My duty thought and prayed about for weeks, I could not say the word to set you free. Alethea. The word to set me free! that were indeed Most difficult to say, for we are bound Indissolubly:—and though, Edgar dear, You tell me that for us all hope is o'er Of earthly union: yet there still remains A radiant future seen through mists of tears, Since present life is not our whole existence. Your name means ‘happy honour,’ and mine own ‘Truth:’—if we live our little span of days Worthy of such high names, it will be well With us, whate'er may come. Yet when I look On your poor face and mark the touch of pain, Then, though I feel that doubtless you are right In that you say, it makes me doubly sad To think the fate that makes you suffer so, Remorseless and unsatisfied, compels You thus to blight your life; but if fond love And sympathy can cheer, you yet may find Some earthly joy remaining even to you. SCENE VI. Midwinter in a certain little island abroad. A pretty room with opened windows overlooking a lovely garden, and a still lovelier prospect beyond. Time.—A few years afterwards, towards sunset, and only a few days before Edgar's death. Edgar and Alethea. Edgar. Truly a grand, a noble thing is life— This most I feel when I am passing from it; And life is fair, whatever cynics say. But yesterday I lay upon my couch And looked upon the clear wide-stretching bay, Far, far beneath me shimmering in the sun. I saw th' exquisite azure of the sky, The dainty outlines of palm-branches shown More clearly by the strong light showered upon them, The countless clustering vines and varied trees In all the gentle ever-pleasing glow Of vegetation almost tropical, Which makes each cultivated garden here Appear a paradise. Banana-trees I saw with all their load of luscious fruit The graceful guava-trees with light-green leaves The loquats with their deeper verdant tints,— The little plant they call ‘Brazilian cherry,’ With bright green leaves, and fruit of strawberry size,— The stately yam-tree with its blossoms white And lily-like;—fair to the eye indeed, A tree whose oval leaves afford good shade In summer. Surely it is strangely sweet To loiter in such gardens when cool Night Has conquered the fierce ardour of the day,— And see the meek moon rise o'er azure seas,— And view the tranquil heavens don their jewels, And hear machêtes swift tingling forth an air Of music,—haply a soft mazy dance. Yet, dear Alethea, it is decreed That I must leave you, darling, but although 'Tis sad to leave you and this beauteous world, 'Tis sweet to die amid such loveliness. And daily I thank God that He hath not Condemned me to this sickness slow and sure Immured in one close room from day to day, Through the long, lagging, weary winter-time, But given me the means wherewith to dwell In climate such as this where balmy air And sunshine even in winter, are not wanting; A climate where the invalid can pass, However languid, many happy hours Communing with God's fair earth out of doors. Do you remember, dear, some years ago You told me if fond love and sympathy Could soothe me that I surely should be cheered? And you have kept your word: I have been cheered, And comforted, and though no marriage-bond Has been between us as we once had hoped, Our souls have been as one. Take my poor thanks For coming thus to sojourn where I dwelt And giving me your loving tireless care 'Mid all my pain and suffering, made less hard To bear by your kind presence. Alethea. I am glad It was my lot to render you this service,— A service small indeed compared with love Such as I bear you, darling. Edgar. When I die, Let me be buried in my native land, Not here, although I love this sea-girt shore, Where graveyards are embowered mid beauteous trees, And overlook mayhap light rippling waves As blue as the deep azure heavens above them, Round whose rude tombs the scented roses cling. And still bloom on throughout the sunny year. But let me rather lie where chilling rain And bitter sleet shall in the winter-time Beat on my resting-place. For what care I Though placid snows spread o'er my quiet grave Their spotless mantle, though wild wintry winds Sweep o'er it, be it only undisturbed. And if 'twere here, perchance it would not be For ever left in pcace. Alethea, For Time we shall be separated soon, But do not grieve o'ermuch. For me 'twill be A glad release from pain, and you and I Shall meet in yon pure Home of Love at last. VERSES OF TRAVEL. A BISCAYAN SUNSET. April 17th, 1879. A golden halo gilds the sky, And the wind-unruffled sea, A scene it is where poet's eye Could subtle loveliness descry Unweariedly. Hark! from afar the deep-toned roar Of the Atlantic surge— Yon sail will soon be seen no more Now light-illumed: 'tis fleeting o'er The sea-scape's verge. The stars appear—strange visions rise; Of man's dim destiny How typical are these calm skies! While like to man the sad sea lies Troubled though free. No wingèd wanderer slowly cleaves The silence in his flight;— His burning throne the Warmth-King leaves While the fair firmament receives The crown'd Queen Night. AFTER SUNSET OFF PAUILLAC, FRANCE. April 18th, 1879. Day hath departed, save a few faint streaks Of light that fleck the bosom of the sky; These, and these only, stay to testify Of proud Night's conquest. Hark! that sound bespeaks Our nearness to the Ocean, and I see Its ripples at my feet;—a soft clear song Is brceze-borne from a vessel's deck along. The crew with musical monotony Raise anchor swiftly, and the ship doth glide In silence, save for the chant growing low Wave-wafted landwards. Little doth she know If calms will come, or fiercest storms betide:— Alas, o'er life's strange sea we all must sail Like her, nor know if calm or tempest will prevail. ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF THE PYRENEES. Majestic snow-crowned mountains distant far, Yet to man's seeming near! How oft we feel In life 'tis even thus! though there the view, That seems so close before us full and fair, May ne'er be realized, while here it needs But purpose long-sustained to gain the goal And prove the seeming real. Whilst I gaze Upon your cloud-capt summits, thoughts arise Telling of eager spirits not a few Who like to me have looked in ages past, Filled with the selfsame dream of human change, And your immutability compared With man's brief mundane course. How many too Have lounged and looked on your cloud-piercing peaks, Nor felt the deep reflection such a scene Is fitted well to give! Strange! but 'tis so, And will be ever while the world endures; That which to one seems passion-fraught, sublime, Another views,—deems fine,—and passes on. A DIRGE OF DECAY. Near Argelez in the Department of the Hautes Pyrénées, France, are several ruins of old castles said to have been built by the English in the 15th century. Within these walls Now half-forgotten, lonely and decayed, Only the birds their resting-place have made, And scarce a step within them ever falls. Yet doubtless here Stupendous deeds of valour have been wrought,— Deeds that to many thousands then were fraught With heart-felt weal or deep and direful fear. Brave of the brave Our soldiers must assuredly have been, So long to hold for our proud Island-queen This land which then seemed far across the wave. Yes, far from aid, From friends, from home, must have appeared their lot, And yet (O courage great!) they faltered not, Nor, filled with craven terror, were afraid; Not even though Full oft encompassed, like unto a stag By hounds engirt; but rallied round their flag, And kept its honour stainless from the foe. Why is it then That low in ruins are these castles laid? It is because old courage had decayed,— It is because old fire had left our men. This should we learn While earth remaineth thus,—wars cannot cease; That everything hath limits,—even peace; So let the lamp of ancient courage burn. LINES ON LOOKING UP THE VALE OF BARÉGES FROM ST. SAUVEUR, HAUTES PYRÉNÉES, FRANCE. Lo! what a glorious prospect is revealed Of mountains, snow, and verdant loveliness; Upon the sloping sides of monarch heights Reposes now the mist, most gracefully, In wreaths almost transparent; presently Its mass divides, and clear against the sky Appears each giant summit grandly calm, And seeming proud that its lone God-wrought strength So long defies decay. One ever feels In gazing on such scenes how weak is man, Yet still how much his art hath made increase To this rare store of beauty. Each small patch Perceived upon the mountain-side, reclaimed From barren wilderness, hath wondrous power To cheer the eye. To me it often seems As though no prospect were indeed complete Without some trace of toil to leaven it. FROM LA RAILLÈRE TO PONT D'ESPAGNE AND LAC DE GAUBE. O path which seems to have a loveliness More than of Earth, How can one who has viewed thy scenes express The thoughts that unto them have owed their birth? How can he tell of all the wondrous way Where grandeur vies With beauty, rich and rare, to bear the sway In winning and retaining ravished eyes? How can he tell of rocks and ridges wild Which lie around? Of mighty mountain-peaks on high up-piled? Of ceaseless cataracts' majestic sound? How can he well describe rich-foliaged trees That screen the sides? Blown to and fro by gentle summer breeze,— In chasms where the vale the rocks divides. How can he well describe the stately pines Steadfast and strong? (True type of one whose sun not always shines, And yet who bravely bears grief's load along.) High-foaming Cérizet can he portray? Beyond the power Of language even feebly to convey Its peerless beauty, wonder-working dower. Much less the wilder falls at Pont d'Espagne Truly sublime,— Whose weird white floods sing songs of sturdy strain, For aye the same in nature-ordered time. When Lac de Gaube is reached, how can he tell The silent sight Of snow and glaciers? Soon our bosoms swell With feelings half of fear, half of delight. The fairy rainbow tints which o'er the falls Glimmer and play, The stilly clearness of the lake enthralls, Yes this and all, in us soon holds full sway. Though none can well describe these scenes, shall not They in the mind Remain to bring forth fruit, a gladsome spot In memory, a gift for good designed! AT ORTHEZ SONNET On seeing a Sham Fight of French Troops at Orthez, in exactly the same position as those occupied by the English and French Armies in the memorable action of February 14th, 1814. A February day in years long fled, A fiercely raging battle hour by hour, At length gained by a mind of mighty power Through wonder-working skill. French troops are spread Along the ridge of hills and fertile vales Where that stern strife was once. For mimic war They are arranged precisely as of yore, Is the result as in the old men's tales Who saw the real conflict? Nay, not so, The French now hold the heights. Fictitious foes Are beaten by the patriots who oppose. ‘The English hounds who wrought our pride's o'erthrow,’ Doubtless thinks many a soldier, ‘now would feel, If they were here once more, the force of Frenchmen's steel.’ THE ESCORIAL, 1879. The Escorial, a glooming pile, standing at the foot of the Guadarrama range of mountains, is the burial-place of the Spanish Kings, and it is so vast that it looks imposing even amid natural grandeur. How sternly the Escorial stands,— The burial-place of kings, Who at disloyal Death's commands Must leave their princely things, And hie to this stupendous pile, That looks so cold and lone,— Where nature scarcely dares to smile, And verdure seems unknown,— To this sad spot where Summer's glare Beats fiercest and most strong,— Where swooping from his mountain lair Winter abideth long. Ah, yes, it must be change indeed From grandeur such as theirs To such a spot to come with speed, To be Corruption's heirs. For evermore to lay aside Insignia of power,— All-humbled stately monarch pride In death's still awful hour. And yet 'twere better thus to be Entombed 'mid marble walls, Where even his foot who comes to see In seeming reverence falls, Than to be huddled with the rest In some dank burial-ground, Where in a few years' time at best One's place could not be found. Men prate that Nature ne'er obtains Her long-predestined dues, And show that we with mighty pains Should alter all our views On points of sepulchre. For me, Though o'er it fall Oblivion's frost, I trust for aye my grave shall be Neither disturbed nor lost. LINES ON PASSING IN AN EXPRESS TRAIN THROUGH BADAJOZ, NOTED FOR ITS FAMOUS SIEGE DURING THE PENINSULAR WAR. And is this Badajoz? where once was heard The clash of arms, and breaching cannons' roar, Where from the dim-lit parallels came forth The forlorn hope at Duty's stern command? Where swords and bayonets bristled on cold walls, And multitudes of marksmen sought to stay The assailing columns in their onward course? Where, when the town was gained, grim Plunder stalked Amid its devastated streets, and made Them ghastlier even than War? Years yield strange fruit Of alteration in forsaken paths; Yet was I strangely struck with the great change Wrought here in Badajoz. Can it be true That here a most prosaic railway-station Is now erected, with its telegraph, Poor restaurant, and porters to be ‘tipped’? And that of travellers, who tread its platform When trains a moment stop, scarce any think Of that bold siege which for all coming years Has blazoned ‘Badajoz’ on Fame's high scroll? CINTRA in 1879. Cintra, our Byron gave thy name to fame By his description grand, and sweet, and true; But though thy ‘mountain's ever beauteous brow’ And many other objects are unchanged, Yet altered are full many of the scenes On which the poet looked, and mused and sang. No ‘frugal monks their little relics show’ To strangers at ‘Our Lady's house of woe.’ One sees their tiny cells, their cork-wood walls, Honorius's cave, and that is all. The former home of ‘England's wealthiest son’ No longer has its ‘portals gaping wide,’ Its ‘halls deserted,’ or great ‘giant weeds’ Within its garden ground:—but it is fair, Fair as the lordly traveller declared It was of yore. While ‘Marialva's dome’ Is changed in that 'tis now historical, Its fame a lasting one, whilst in his day Its interest was eclipsed by other themes Of ever-varying War:—the deed performed Within its gates too recent not to be Left unto record of the daily gossip, And comments of the press which rarely live. All now is different:—a classic scene Thou standest, Cintra, clothed with more of fame (To English minds at least) from Byron's words Than from thy matchless beauty, could that be. And mayhap, in the years to come, some poet Treading the self-same scenes will tell how one, A writer of poor verses, tried to tell What changes there had been since Byron wrote; And he, in turn, with glowing eloquence Will paint with poet's art the tide of Change On Cintra since these lines were given forth. A LESTÉ SUNRISE IN MADEIRA. Many-hued the sky this morn, Beautiful the day is born, Fleecy clouds on every side Sunshine's coming seem to hide, But the other cloudlets stand Ready waiting its command. Ay, they are a gorgeous group, Almost each tint in the troop, Red, and light blue, and maroon, And some white appearing soon, And a glorious purple shade Over all is deftly laid. O'er the mountains purple clouds Of deep colour hang, like shrouds; Purple masses faint are shed O'er the Ocean's wave-strewn bed, Fine the light which now one sees, On the palms and tropic trees. Swiftly fades the splendid sky To a dimly purple dye; Gently stirs the landward breeze Shapely-formed banana-trees. Dawn's first freshness wears away, And begins the balmy day. MADEIRA—MOONLIGHT. Stealing softly o'er the mountains, Skirting Funchal's scattered town, To the eastward, comes the moonlight Flinging its effulgence down; Making every object glitter In its clear and tranquil sheen, While the Ocean lately troubled Seemeth lapt in peace serene. Subtle moonlight! how thy radiance With a magic often shown Touches and refines a landscape With a glamour all thine own! So thou causest here the houses Mean, nay squalid, in the light, To appear a pearly pureness Rather than a dirty white. For the filth and streets so narrow, With vile odours bred by day, Save for Nature's glorious grandeur, Takes admiring thoughts away; But the moonbeam maketh all things Gain at least a semblance meet, Till at length the wide-spread prospect Has an aspect almost sweet. AT SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE. Feb. 19, 1880. 'Tis fashionable now to say That skill displayed in war is wrong, That they who formed our England's sway, And made her empire firm and strong, Were callous cut-throats nothing less,— Who joyed in war for its own sake,— Who yearned to banish happiness, Who loved with blood their thirst to slake. And yet while landing here to-day, On the same shore which years ago Saw from its crag-encircled bay Our Nelson's only overthrow, I thought, Do those who grub and prose, And by their lights their betters try, Perform their life-tasks more than those Whose task is but ‘to do or die’? GIBRALTAR. 1880. ‘Sweet Seville’ has been sung—and Cadiz too By Byron, for the beauty of her girls,— Yet know I not that one hath given thy due To thee on whose proud crest the cloud-wreath curls. Let me attempt thy praise, then, for I know That worthier pens will write of foreign towns,— For now no place has praise with us, if so It be mayhap a jewel of our Crown's. ‘Sweet Seville's’ Guadalquivir, famed in song, Is nothing save a nearly stagnant stream. The beauty of the Cadiz maiden throng Exists,—but in a ‘poet's airy dream.’ Here in Gibraltar all retains an air Of honest truth. Odourless streets are clean, And everything is made the most of, where Man's art avails to soften down the scene. The gardens of the Alameda, full Of semi-tropic plants and shady trees, Pleasant to lounge in their recesses cool On summer eves to catch the soft sea-breeze. Yet great the toil and patience must have been Before at last was made such rocky ground To nourish shrub, or plant, or aught of green. Cheering it is to hear the home-like sound Of English tongues,—to see our cared-for men,— Contrasted with the Spaniards wan and weak, Guarding their posts, as they with eager ken Look on our cannon, which have but to speak— To put their lines to rout. How lovely gleams The Rock at sunrise! The grey looming clouds Glow in the new-born light like glorious dreams, While Shadow still the tranquil bay enshrouds. Ay, grim Gibraltar, thou indeed art fair! And more than that, a place in which one may Live with true home-like comfort, and a share Of a good climate, brightening Life's dull day. GRANADA. Fair Granada, our masters of the pen Have written much of thee, and not a few Who ne'er have seen thee, hold dream-wrought and fair, A city in their fancy by thy name Seen clearly in their mental eyes, as if 'Twere mirrored in their senses. Thus with me; But when I saw, my fond ideal fell. It was not that thy famed Alhambra hill Lacked grandeur, or its silent courts were void Of architectural wealth, or that the Vega, Shut in by mountains and the silent snows, Was aught save fair; yet still the impression stays Unceasingly within me, caused perchance By narrow Spanish streets, dull, dirty, white, Or likelier that the sight of scaffoldings And fresh-wrought antique work amid the old In the Alham bra's courts destroy their charm. THE CERTOSA OF PAVIA; A GREAT ITALIAN CONVENT, AND GRAND WORK OF ART. Great monument of human skill! How vast must be the power and scope Of minds which can conceive,—of hands That shape such edifices rare;— And doth the splendid sight not show Convincingly how wondrous is The grandeur, mightiness of Man, Despite his body frail, and train Of weary woes, which almost ever Attends him, ere King Death with sway Imperious demands his spoil? And do such sights not educate, If we may phrase it thus, the soul, Leading us far more to believe In the proud majesty of Art? The marble cuttings exquisite Near the high altar, the mosaics Gorgeous; yet though so finely wrought, Designed in truly simple taste, The stately stalls of workmanship Replete with loveliness and rich In cunning inlaid work. The aspect Of the exterior, the carvings So realistic near the door— The outer door—of Roman coins (Though strange to see these Pagan heads) At entrance to a Christian church. All, all make up a noble whole, And fill the heart with feelings which 'Twere better that it ne'er forgot. SONGS AND LYRICS. THE LATE AUTUMN IS DYING. The late Autumn is dying, Dead leaves strew the land— Signs of sorrow now lying On every hand; While I walk full of sadness In a garden once fair, Where before all was gladness, I find trouble there. In a hedge-row wind-shaken To wildest unrest, Forlorn and forsaken, I see a bird's nest,— Its soft down decaying— Its fledglings all flown,— Nought save the shell staying Deserted and lone. Then the thought cometh cleaving The depths of my mind— Soon we too must be leaving Our loved homes behind,— The drear tomb will enclose us, Life's pilgrimage o'er,— “And the place that now knows us Shall know us no more.” UNFULFILLED YEARNINGS. When Summer's sweetest influence Is shed o'er plain and hill, And Nature gains her recompense For working Winter's will, We feel a void—a weary sense Of something wanting still. In Autumn, when each searing leaf With sorrow aye is fraught, And every garnered golden sheaf Yields fruit for saddest thought, We feel a void—our spirits' grief For something vainly sought. When Winter with his ice-cold hand Grasps giant-like the ground, And stiff and stark lies all the land In frost's firm fetters bound, We feel a void—we understand 'Tis something still unfound. When Spring returns with fairest face, Filling the earth with song, And gladness seems in every place, And love and life are strong, Ah me! even then we fail to trace The dream for which we long. GLAD DREAMS OF THE FUTURE COME O'ER US. Glad dreams of the Future come o'er us, All radiantly spotless and bright, And bid us look up—for before us Are vistas of boundless delight. O come when our bosoms are weary, Life-burdened and longing for rest, And point through the darkness still dreary To a land which by sunlight is blest. O come when the world has been gaining O'er our souls an insidious sway, Our fickle rash footsteps restraining From wandering out of the way. O come, that o'er all of Earth's changes Your light as a guide may be shed, Whether like unto others, or strange is, The path that in Life we must tread. And when finished at length is Life's story, Completed its words and its acts, Then burst on our sight in your glory Not as dreams, but immutable facts. A SONG OF HOPE. The vinery's foliage In Autumn grows sere, For its wealth of bright beauty Fades out with the year: All its branches, where lately Grape clusters were spread, Become barren and sapless And seem as though dead. But long ere the soft Spring Clothes the land in glad green, On its boughs beauteous blossoms Are lavishly seen, As it uses the warmth Which is placed in its power, And so rallies more swiftly From Winter's rude hour. Thus if we, when some sorrow O'erwhelming appears, And which threatens to banish The light of our years, Would the blessings still left In our service employ, Then whate'er be the issue, 'Twould bring us but joy. HOW OFT ARISE TO SOOTHE OUR WOE. How oft arise to soothe our woe, And dissipate our sadness, Fond dreams of faces long ago When life was love and gladness. Like, yet unlike the lights that guide The storm-tossed o'er the ocean, They in our secret souls abide, Cherished with deep devotion. The halcyon Past seems to possess, When we review its story, One radiance of happiness, Nor cloud to dim its glory; So ah, 'tis well, when lonely lies Life's pathway girt with sorrow, That sometimes visions fair should rise Which from our Past we borrow. HAPPINESS HERE. There is happiness, dearest— True happiness here,— Though the troubles thou fearest Perchance may appear: For mid every emotion Of weal or of woe, Our depths of devotion No respite shall know. Yes,—in Life's twisted tissue Of gladness and grief, Love, whate'er be the issue, Still renders relief. So there's happiness, dearest— True happiness here,— Though the troubles thou fearest Perchance may appear. A SONG IN THE SOUTH. The proud sun is setting, most fair to behold, Going down to his rest in a garment of gold, And, like a young maiden who wishes good-bye To her dear chosen lover, deep blushes the sky, All its beautiful tints, ah! how fair to behold As the sun goeth down in his garment of gold. Light blue and dark blue and purple are there, Red, brown, and golden with bounty how rare! Black clouds o'er the mountains, white clouds o'er the sea, And a landward breeze cometh soft, joyous, and free. A prospect how glorious in truth to behold As the sun goeth down in his garment of gold. All wondrously blent as He only can do Who gives to each tint its own delicate hue, Who makes Nature's paintings so gorgeously grand, That man can but copy, not daring to stand In rivalry open. Yes, fair to behold Is the sun going down in his garment of gold. TWILIGHT MEMORIES. How once I loved the twilight hour Of Summer's blissful day, While watching from each leafy bower The daylight die away, And clasping in mine own the hand Of one I loved the best, Whose converse soothed, as the sight of land Doth mariners distressed. Right bravely he had borne his part In Earth's incessant strife, Still labouring on with dauntless heart Amid the ills of Life. Had known adversity and pain,— Hopes blighted—bitter wrong,— Yet all to sour his soul were vain: In Heaven-born strength 'twas strong. And oft he talked of his vanished years In the gentle gloaming tide, Bidding me all my joys and fears Implicitly confide, And wisely would my future trace, Then leaving things of Time, In raptured tones and with upturned face Would speak of themes sublime. His that strange wordless eloquence, Always a wondrous power, Which sways the soul with a force intense In the calm of such an hour. And when I walk where shadows steal O'er Summer's fairy view, I never, never fail to feel That influence anew. A WINTRY MOOR AT NIGHT. My way led o'er a wintry waste When evening shades were falling, And the soft sheep-bells rung in haste The fleecy flocks were calling,— For still a few had strayed afield To wander mid the heather, Seeking the food the hill-sides yield Despite such withering weather. Chorus. A wintry moor! A wintry moor! Alone at dark of night, Where in the world may one procure More desolate a sight? Black barren rocks were on the right, Uprising bleak and lone, Like the fabled forms of men of might Fast petrified to stone. And far and wide on every side, The mazy mist extended, Slowly its mass did upwards glide, Till with the sky it blended. Chorus. A wintry moor! etc. I thought of deeds of darkness done On that drear waste so lonely! That there had perished many an one For lack of succour only. And I strode along with swifter pace, A thrill o'er my bosom stealing, Reaching at last my resting-place With pleasurable feeling. Chorus. A wintry moor! etc. A SEA SONG. I could not as a landsman live, Pursuing his poor pleasure, Each dull delight his course may give Has nought in it to measure With the true transport of the soul, O'er every sense prevailing, When 'neath our feet the wild waves roll, We o'er the ocean sailing. Chorus. A sailor's life! a sailor's life! Upon the swelling sea, Whose surges roar in ceaseless strife— A sailor's life for me. I love it when in summer-time It lies, all ill concealing, And o'er its ripples comes the chime Of church-bells softly stealing. I love it when in grandest storm, Like some great monster playing; It spurns on high the vessel's form, To mock it ere its slaying. Chorus. A sailor's life! etc. Then, as our voyage is nearly gone, And soon to port returning, I love the waves which waft me on To soothe my constant yearning. And when the dear land is espied— Dispelling all our sadness— I bless the swiftly flowing tide Which bears me on to gladness. Chorus. A sailor's life! etc. WHY DO I TRACE. Why do I trace On your loved face Such weary wealth of sorrow, Where late beamed joy With nought to cloy, Caused by the cares to-morrow? The world I know Is full of woe, Encircled round with trouble,— Yet merely sighs And mournful eyes,— But make our griefs redouble. Look up in haste! Nor longer waste Your life in weak bemoanings;— Cast grim Despair From out his lair! You've known enough of groanings. No skies o'ercast One whit more fast Because we thus are cheerful,— Clouds come apace With frowning face Full oft when we are tearful. Then may we here Spurn foolish fear, Nor let fond Hope forsake us, So having joy With nought to cloy Until the storm o'ertake us. A PRACTICAL THEORY OF LIFE. When musing on the course of Life How many seem its phases, Yet every one of them is rife With trebly tangled mazes. And though our prospects all are fair, A scene made for enjoying, Some canker-worm intrudeth there Our perfect bliss destroying. One man is strong and has delight Merely in Life's possessing, But pinching Poverty's bleak blight Marreth his every blessing. Another's wealth and friends agree To lavish pleasures on him, Yet look, alas! 'tis clear to see Disease's curse upon him; Disease—for which weak human skill Gives scant alleviation,— He is doomed to dread Existence still Despite his smiling station. A third has pulse of purest health Which yields him nought save gladness, But private griefs amid his wealth Impart a sense of sadness. If we the daily deeds recite Which form Life's present measure, The wrong preponderates o'er the right, And suffering over pleasure. And thus whate'er our lot may be, Our life is but a bubble, Blown from some bleak and cruel sea By the tornado Trouble. Ah! what a mystery is this! And yet if we revolve it, Perchance we may not muse amiss, But find a clue to solve it. It oft appears absurd to believe In a God of infinite kindness, Who, seeming paradox, can leave Us in such woe and blindness, In perfect Goodness—omnipotent Power, Permitting Evil to enter Its fair dominions, and to shower Such griefs on man, their centre, But if we accept the sceptic view, Denying a God and Life's fruition, What do we gain even were that true? For it is merely demolition Of many hopes which man holds dear Of a swiftly coming morrow, When we shall know with joy sincere No sense of sin or sorrow, Without revealing to our sight A future fair and clearer: Nay, leaving all in deepest night— Far darker, lone and drearer. For we still must bear the woes of Life With the longings which oft come o'er us Whilst seeing no rest beyond its strife, Save nothingness before us. While a Heavenly hope amid our woe Will cheer our Life's endeavour, And yield us nought save good, although At death it may fly for ever. Thus, even if we set aside Religion's proofs completely, It gives more joy our minds to guide Till, apprehending meetly That doubtless though upon the earth Our path is oft perplexing, Its lack of love and chastened mirth Our spirits sorely vexing, There must exist a place which gained Through faith and strong endeavour, What seems unjust will be explained, Or rectified for ever:— That there's a God who made Man's mind With certain comprehension, But yet Who has seen fit to bind Its limits of extension. Who also deemed it best for Man Here to experience sadness, As training for a higher plan Of grandly growing gladness. Thus human Reason's utmost sphere Of thought is reached full early; And thus to us men's lots appear So often dealt unfairly. That Life's dark mysteries but transcend, Not contradict our reason, And so when earthly life shall end There comes a sun-lit season, When with enlarged God-given powers And intellects commanding, One bliss of Heaven's bright halcyon hours Shall be the understanding Of problems which distressed the sage Of deepest skill and learning, But now that we have burst our cage Are easy of discerning, While “themes with which we cannot cope” Fade 'neath our Heavenly vision, “And Earth's worst phrenzies, marring hope, Will mar not Hope's fruition.” EVENING THOUGHTS. It was evening, and sadness Around me was cast— For rejoicing and gladness Too swiftly were past. Then methought with deep anguish, In Life's dreary day, All we love must soon languish And wither away. Ah! how futile each token Of love given here, Merely made to be broken When friendships grow sere; Though sweet youth's summer morning Dawned balmy and bright, Yet our sorrow soon scorning, It darkened to night. Thus in bitter bewailing I poured forth my grief, When this glad hope prevailing Gave richest relief: As the blossoms of May-time Must fade and grow sere, Ere the ripe Autumn gay time Of fruit can appear, So Love's bright buds immortal Must seemingly die, Ere within Heaven's portal They blossom on high, In fruition for ever To each constant soul Who through faithful endeavour Gains Life's glorious goal. THOUGHT-LINKS. Mysterious are the links that firmly bind Our trains of thought together. First we brood On some small trivial matter—tiny germ Of somewhat grander musings—then we find A thread is woven with our thought, and lo It leads to higher themes!—vast vistas new For serious contemplation:—and we gain Sublimest heights, while God-reflected thoughts Transcending Reason flood our human mind. JOY AND GRIEF. Nought gives true happiness unless it touch Some chord of subtle feeling in the soul, And thus what oft appear most trivial things Impart such great delight:—a kindly phrase, A friendly greeting in the street, or snatch Of melody but for a moment heard:— Or even some phrases in a general talk Addressed to others, heard through being near. Each of us is an instrument, but each Is in some notes at least diversely strung From all our fellows. The musician Joy With mystic power can play upon our hearts, And through the heart can ope the hidden door That guards the sanctuary of the soul. Grief has an equal power, and quickly finds The portals of the soul, but having found, He enters not to play with skilful touch, But roughly beats with rude untutored hand Upon responsive tender notes, and so Instead of music only discord comes. AFTER FIVE YEARS. After five years! What changes will have come Among the circle of our firmest friends! Some will have gone to widely severed lands,— While others—than whom none seemed closer bound In silken chains of love—will then perchance, Urged by some paltry source of petty feud, Made greater by their pride, have ceased to meet In harmony. And silent callous Death Will certainly have stayed the mortal course Of not a few, though friends we have not now We shall know then. In circumstances also What changes will have dawned! The man esteemed Almost a pauper now may then have wealth Unbounded,—he whose store of riches seems Limitless now may be a beggar then. He who enjoys the bliss of nerveless health May then be broken down and weak of limb, While he who now an invalid, though dowered With youth, his ills all conquered, may be strong. What alterations will have come to pass Throughout the world! Peace in the place of war Or war in place of peace; and the appearance Of present party strife in politics Will then be altered quite,—while topics new Will eagerly be canvassed. Many names Novel to us will then have sprung to fame In Life's inconstant whirl, while designations Notorious now may even be then forgotten. Yet there is one thing while the Earth remains That will not change, and that one thing is—Change. MATERNAL LOVE. Maternal love is ever tender and kind, From sinful dross of selfishness refined; In infant years it is a tender guide To keep us safe from harm on every side; And when our cherished childhood's days are past, It nerves us to endure the world's rough blast. Its mellowed memory is with us still, In joy or sorrow, happiness or ill, And like some beauteous flower of growth sublime, Transplanted for awhile to this chill clime, It sheds its sweetest fragrance on our way, Reviving drooping hearts in Life's dark day. PARTING WORDS. How oft the parting words of loved ones dear Are cherished fondly all our lifetime here, And Memory, in calm reflection's hour, Recalls them to the mind with vivid power; And frequently most bitterly we feel The impotence of Time our grief to heal. Ah! tender parting words, how soon is felt Your influence the hardest heart to melt— And as a babe upon its mother's breast Is soothed unconsciously to quiet rest, So gradually it steals o'er each sad soul, And holds our feelings in its firm control. HOMEWARD. I. Each moment nearing fast her home, A ship is cleaving through the foam,— Home! ah, how sweet to those Who in strange lands have absent been, But still recalling each loved scene— Their heart with rapture glows. Thus there is boundless joy on board, And jocundly with one accord Are all prepared to land; For when this last long night is done Their hopes rise with the morrow's sun,— Their haven is at hand. Some sense-o'erstrainèd cannot sleep, And through the watches wakeful keep,— Longing for dawn of light; The deck is paced by dauntless men, The night is dark, save now and then When stars appear in sight. II. What was that crash! that dismal sound Which echoes through the darkness round— That sharp soul-stricken scream? The glance doth on confusion fall, Those on the deck are wild, and all Is like a dreadsome dream. The ship has struck not far from shore, But boisterously the billows roar, Along a rock-bound bay; Two boats are manned to put to land, And struggling hard to gain the strand, Pull through the blinding spray, Leaving the rest to face their fate as best they may. III. The scene so lately still and calm Seems nothing now save loud alarm, And dread and direful woe— One sight of sorrow meets the eye On deck or down below. While wind and seething waters vie In working ill around, Like sorcerers resolved to try Their secret arts profound. Shrill shrieks are heard on every side, And none now aid nor seek to guide The mad unresting crowd, Who, scarce aware of what they do, Pace passionately the deck; a few Murmur a prayer heartfelt and true, Or bitter moans—or curses too In accents lewd and loud. IV. Down in a cabin lies a child Heedless of death or tumult wild, By sleep with blissful dreams beguiled: A man reclines, removed a space, Scarce entered middle life— Yet in whose face you well may trace Sad signs of care and strife. V. Now to the infant's side he springs, And very speedily he brings His charge from down below. He casts one glance upon the storm, Then tightly grasps the tiny form— Nor shrinking seems to know. VI. His thoughts revert to long ago, When fragile as this little child, A mother's love upon him smiled As it assuaged each infant woe:— And taught him to be true and brave In this weak world of sordid strife, And even content to part with life Did it perchance another save. And then he prays to One above To guide him in this deed of love. VII. From the doomed ship without delay Through the wild waves he cleaves his way, Needing surpassing strength And dauntless courage thus to dare To hold his burden and to bear A swim of such a length. The ruthless waters round him roll, He well-nigh loses all control— Yet still he struggles on; And clasping to his breast the child, He grapples with the billows wild Till strength is almost gone. VIII. But see! his task is nearly o'er, If he can swim a few yards more, They surely reach the longed-for shore; Brief moments now their fate will show Whether it be of weal or woe. IX. And still he shapes his steadfast course Straight onward to the land, Yet with each stroke makes less the force Which he can still command. But all seems well—an instant more Will see them safely on the shore. X. Sudden a gasp—a gurgling sound— A short convulsive groan,— And nothing now is heard around Save the fierce storm alone. For he has sunk to rise no more, Exhausted with the conflict sore, And as a rain-drop falling on a lake Ripples its surface, yet can scarcely break The depths beneath, so softly thus sinks he Into the Ocean of Eternity. AN OCEAN GLOAMING. I pray you, hark,— What is it that each seems to crave, As over each mid-ocean wave It groweth dark? The angry gale Strikes our stout ship in mockery, And now they fiercely fight to see Who shall prevail. The seething spray Dashes on high, and has the whole Range of the deck without control Under its sway. Our sturdy ship's Tossings and creaks are like to pain, And ofttimes in the surging main Her beams she dips. Look, just in sight, Two creamy piles of foam between, A little barque is rolling seen Mid gathering night. A signal goes Quick up her mast and there remains; “Where now she is,” the mate explains, “She scarcely knows, And asks that we Should tell her.” Swiftly our reply Runs up the mast, and then we try To find if she Perceives the sign, Ere yet she's out of sight. Full slow Pass the dread hours ere Morning's glow Makes Night to pine, And die away. But when the light is come at length, We're sheltered safe from Ocean's strength Within the bay. A SUMMER SCENE. Bright beams of sunlight gild the lawn, And the whole landscape seems as drawn From some enchanter's treasure;— The songsters carol loud and clear, Ah, how I dearly love to hear Their sweet melodious measure. And while I loiter 'neath the trees, Delicious perfumes by the breeze Are wafted from the hay-field, Where village urchins pleasure court, And making round the ricks their sport, Transform it to a play-field. Must this fair vision fade away? It must—and for its death to-day I feel a sense of sorrow; But gladness comes to fill its place When Hope reminds with smiling face— “'Twill live again to-morrow.” SUMMER SORROW. Each season hath its sadness, and for me Summer not least of all. I know not why, But though its sylvan beauty soothes my soul Into delicious reveries; while birds, Discoursing music, fill my dreamy mind With melodies, and thoughts, and deep delight, I never felt before—yet still there lurks Within my heart a strange unfathomed grief, Which, even amidst harsh Autumn's ravages, Or grim old Winter's storms, I rarely feel. A SUMMER EVENING IN THE WOODS. How beautiful the forest looks to-night, The trees just moving in the still calm air; And very many of the birds delight In warbling forth their notes without a care. The graceful boughs which erst were gaunt and bare Have donned their fairest dress; the insects keep A dreamy, murmuring revel everywhere; But in the woodland glades, so dark and deep, Save but for these few sounds, all nature seems to sleep. The stars come slowly out, and very soon The summer day in peace and calmness ends; And by-and-by, as rises slow the moon, Her light with splendour on the scene descends: While she amid the clouds her pathway wends Majestic as a queen, and they stand near Like courtiers round her throne; each object lends Fresh beauty to the landscape dim, yet clear Enough to let its wondrous loveliness appear. Scenes like to this exert a mighty power To soothe us, and to cause our minds to stray— If only for a brief and transient hour— From weary cares which fill them day by day; And soon our thoughts fly swiftly far away To some bright reminiscence of the past, And for a while engrossed with it they stay; And when our reverie is done at last, How deeply we regret such moments fly so fast! TWILIGHT THOUGHTS. How charming is the summer eve, removed from cities far, Where Nature's spotless loveliness nought intervenes to mar; Where wild-rose and convolvulus are woven in the hedge, And buttercups and foxgloves gay rise from the brooklet's edge; Where zephyrs waft their sweetest scents adown the waving wood, And the soothing songs of Nature's choir impel us to intrude:— When shadows creep across our path, and Day is well-nigh dead, 'Tis then that Summer ever seems her glamour best to spread. Where in this weary world can more of perfect peace be found, Than when on such a scene we gaze in sympathy around? And often will some fair wild flowers more truly touch the heart Than the resplendent trophies of rare botanic art; The sweet-briar which, perchance unseen, pours perfume on the air, I would not barter for what proved the florist's proudest care; I'll leave the rich their bowers of art in which to rear rare flowers, Enough for me each common plant in Summer's gloaming hours. A LESSON IN THE GLOAMING. One even of a summer's day I walk scarce whither knowing, Save by a river's side I stray Where balmy winds are blowing. 'Tis the loved hour of twilight's close, When o'er the landscape stealing, The last faint ray of sunset glows, Its beauty half revealing. Rich foliage hides the rippling stream From the fair view completely, And gently as in halcyon dream, Its murmur softly, sweetly, Comes zephyr-borne, as on I move With light heart void of sadness, Nor caring what to-morrow prove, So that to-day be gladness. Sudden is heard the plash of oars, A sense of pleasure bringing,— While plaintively a rower pours His soul thus out in singing: In Summer's choicest day, When round each fragrant spray The blithesome breezes stray— Ah, what delight! But brightest days contain The seeds of future pain, And Winter comes again, Their bliss to blight! Not so the joys of Mind, Unfathomed, unconfined, They soar and leave behind Trammels of Earth:— They teach mankind to face Both honour and disgrace, And gain at last the Place Which gave them birth. The boat sweeps on,—the words depart In cadences alluring,— But they have pierced my flippant heart, And left a mark enduring. MEADOW MUSINGS. While treading with purest of pleasure The pathways grass-grown of the fields, The thought that will come without measure Is strange as the fruit that it yields. We dream that on spot we are standing To gaze on the glorious view— Perchance some stern Druid commanding Performèd his orisons due, Ere vengeful and fierce as his foeman, And eager for spoil and applause, He ventured to meet the bold Roman To fight in his dear country's cause. Some Saxon, it may be, with sadness Here mourned the mailed Norman's advance, And on the morrow he ended his madness At the point of the enemy's lance. Perchance after great baron's wassail— In days when such doings were rife, With feudal foes here fought each vassal In bitter inglorious strife. Or the Roundhead recounted the glory Of routing the gay Cavalier, Nor wept, while reciting the story, For former companions a tear. And still as the swiftly winged Ages Press on with impetuous pace, The fools of the Earth and its sages May pause for a while in this place. Then darting away, will commingle In the turmoil with which Life is fraught, And never again will they single This spot out for care or for thought. FLOWER-GATHERING. Two merry children in a meadow see, With faces all aglow with Childhood's glee— While finding fragrant flowrets here and there To weave into a chaplet fresh and fair, Till of the sweet wild flowers they gaily make A guerdon to reward the pains they take. So 'tis, methinks, amid Life's tedious toil, And sordid strife and harassing turmoil; As surely as we seek, we pleasures find, Which bring kind Hope to cheer each mournful mind: And our attempts to seize them oft repay By showering blessings on our weary way. GARDEN MUSINGS. Ah, what a sadness wells within our soul Whilst loitering in garden where erewhile We used to hold sweet interchange of thought With a dearly lovèd lost one; and to know Such days are dead for ever! That for us, Though May-time blossoms make the orchard trees Most beauteous to behold, and every sense In bliss is saturated by the wealth Of Nature's charms profusely spread around, There yet remains enthroned within our heart A deep, dull void, which nought on earth can fill. A COMPARISON. The landscape bright is very fair to see, And all around the birds are blithely singing; And yonder to that venerable tree Tenaciously the ivy's boughs are clinging. But soon the tree is felled and ta'en away, And each slight tendril from its trunk is taken; And now the ivy's beauty will decay, Bereft of its support, lone, and forsaken. So frequently it happens with us all, Round some lov'd object twin'd is our affection, But soon 'tis snatched away beyond recall, And leaves us nothing save its recollection. Then deepest grief and anguish rend the breast, And oft we seem to hear a voice repeating: “Our life is but a shadow at the best, And nought abides, but all is brief and fleeting.” IN TENEBRIS LUX. 'Tis night, and darkness as a pall Enwraps the sable scene, Nor doth one glimmering ray recall Where sunshine erst hath been. Till the moon peereth 'neath a cloud 'Mong floods of borrowed light, And piercing through the landscape's shroud, Dispels the gloom of night. So 'tis in life; mid deepest woe, Oft drawing nigh despair, God-borrowed beams alone still show That joy abideth there. A MORNING MEDITATION. Now the black night will speedily be gone, And the delicious dawning draweth near— Charming each sense, while calmly gazing on The freshly budding beauty which is here; Almost a paradise doth soon appear, Dowered with a glittering flood of dewdrops bright; As the sun's radiance from a higher sphere Seems to produce, even by its gladsome sight, In careworn human hearts a wonderful delight. Ah! who at sunrise could be aught save glad! For 'tis a prototype of perfect day, When we shall wake to bliss, no longer sad, And feel the glowing God-begotten ray Which bids us fling aside all fears which may Still cleave to us; and with enraptured soul Speed to the land where trouble flees away Before His presence, that long-looked-for goal, Where all Earth's weary wounds for ever are made whole. THE WARBLERS' MISSION. One bright day, sad and weary, I wandered the fields, Which often, when dreary, Much happiness yields,— Yet not softest of sighing Of sweet summer breeze, Nor the beauties near lying, My burden could ease. But a bird's note of gladness, Clear borne on the air, Changed my sense of strange sadness And sorrowful care;— And full soon o'er me stealing, In place of my grief, Came a rapturous feeling Of peace and relief. Then I wondered if pinions Were given birds thus To work, mid God's dominions, A mission to us;— Of shedding, midst sadness, Rejoicing and love, And through soothing and gladness, To guide us above. So perchance they flew ever, Devoting their days With ceaseless endeavour To carolling praise:— As true types, though terrestrial, Till song-time be o'er, Of the angels celestial Who chant and adore. MIDNIGHT MUSINGS. The moonbeams' pure brightness Has entered my room, Thus shedding some lightness Where late all was gloom. Yet it leaves much uncertain Which Day would make clear, For the Night's darksome curtain Still lies dim and drear. So, methinks, as in sadness I restlessly toss, 'Tis with dreams of past gladness Our spirits that cross:— Though oftentimes cheering Our souls by their light, We by their appearing Perceive our deep night. “'TIS GONE.” “'Tis gone,” with mournful voice we say, When some great joy departs; And we pursue our weary way With sad and heavy hearts. “'Tis gone,” with gladsome voice we cry, When grief or pain is o'er:— And all the prospect far and nigh Is brighter than before. Seems it not strange that keenest woe This phrase can thus express, And yet be often used to show The highest happiness? ACROSTICS. BURNS. Born of the people with a dower of song;— Unlearnt in academic lore, yet strong; Ranging each chord of lyric minstrelsy 'Neath genius-tutored fingers grandly free; Still sweet and clear thy tones for Time eterne shall be. COWPER. Calm and clear-toned the music of thy song, Of depths diviner than to bards belong, Who scale Parnassian heights with sordid aim:— Pure as a ray of brightly flashing flame Eradiating from Truth's torch to show Rash Man a heavenward path amid Life's woe. THE ELDER HOOD. How brilliant and how versatile art thou,— Of every style a master. Deep-souled thought On many themes is here, rare puns, and now Disports a freak of fancy genius-fraught. KIRKE WHITE. Kind and true-hearted was thy youthful life, In every manly attribute most rife; Rich in a mind rare cultured, and which sought Knowledge with pursuit keen, and ever thought Each effort well repaid that learning brought. Wise thought on such as thee doth cheer the heart, Having their course before us as a chart, In which is shown a way whereby each one, Though sore the toil and scorching be Life's sun, Elated shall receive God's glad “Well done.” A LIFE-CHRONICLE. I. Long years ago a peasant boy Lives as his widowed mother's joy, Her cherished firstborn son; For though her love the others share, They are but babes—for them the care Of life has scarce begun. While the brave brother manfully Strives steadfastly to gain their bread, Resolved to do as well as he Is able in their father's stead. II. He little learning could acquire, Except when sitting at the fire, When work was done on a wintry night, But then it was his chief delight To linger o'er some well-conned page, Dowered with the wisdom of the sage. His thought for every lesser one How charming 'twas to view; And often would he join the fun As leader of the crew. Yet sometimes when apart from man, Upon the lone hill-side, His future anxiously would scan, And long for one to guide His steps to higher spheres of life, If even through severest strife. III. But soon his mood would grow more gay, Like lark which soars at dawn of day; And then before his eyes would play Visions of regions far away. Yet calmly he resolved to stay Till some brief years were o'er, And then a fond farewell to say, And leave his native shore, Boldly to seek his fortune there, And never yield him to despair. IV. The time now comes to say farewell, That word how full of sadness! And yet for aught which one may tell The harbinger of gladness. At least to think so sore he tries When with stout heart but wistful eyes He bids them not to grieve, Saying they soon shall have surprise Which they will scarce believe. Then gently doth bright dreams unfold Of his return with wealth untold. V. Long years have passed, and now once more He views again his native shore; Nor has his stay been spent in vain, For ere he crosses now the main He has of gold an ample store, And better still a well-earned name For honest worth, with nought of shame. His now indeed a bright career, In which each blessing given man here Is granted to him, as if sent As guerdon for his past content, While amid much labour patiently He strove against grim poverty; And succouring the deep-distressed, Proved now the passion of his breast. So when at length in death he slept Many a mourner for him wept. A DREAM OF LONG AGO. A dream of youth comes o'er me— A dream of long ago, When life was light before me, Nor knew the taint of woe. 'Tis of a sun-lit village Built by the bright sea's strand, With widespread fields in tillage Stretching on every hand,— Save on one side where moorland The landscape closes in, Which, though men deemed it poor land, Was dowered with blooming whin. Here there were boundless pleasures For me, a town-bred boy; Here first I found the treasures That country-folk enjoy. Great was my bliss bird-nesting, When butterflies I sought, Or when in quiet resting On turf with fragrance fraught. Its charms indeed were legion, With its odours of wild flowers; It seemed a fairy region To spend the halcyon hours. Once with a strange emotion, I found a blackbird's brood, And watched the dam's devotion, Yet dreaded to intrude. I loved this moorland dearly, With its spots for rest and play— And in my day-dreams clearly Still see it day by day. How pretty looked the river— Which gave the spot its name— As its wavelets used to quiver Beneath the sunset's flame, Which dyed them with a lightness That soon must disappear, Fit emblem of the brightness Which human life has here. What sport to watch the fishers As they left their homes at morn— Surrounded with well-wishers, Holding dread and fear in scorn! And how gladsome were the greetings When they returned at night, And merry were the meetings, For faces all were bright. Life here had much of gladness Despite its dull day's round,— And less of care and sadness Than oft in cities found. How great was my diversion (I was but eight years old) When I went a short excursion, A cart my chariot bold. As onward thus I travelled Mid balmy summer air, Life's skein for me was ravelled With bliss in place of care. I saw them cutting fuel To feed their wintry fire, And, ah, I thought it cruel When bidden to retire. How pleasant the postman meeting, With his merrily sounding horn, And his grave yet gladsome greeting Bestowed on me each morn. While the village people ever, Though rude and unrefined, To me seemed good and clever Because they all were kind. Ah, vision calm and cheering! Soul-soothing none the less, Despite the callous sneering Cold cynics may profess. Thy memories shall not perish Whate'er betide of grief— Yes, evermore I'll cherish This dream to bring relief. IMAGINATION'S HARVEST. Oh, how powerless we seem to secure Fancy's dream, Though before our rapt gaze it be floating; And to garner a mine of the rich gems that shine, Yet are lost for the lack of our noting. Thus in sickness sometimes, like strange musical chimes, Come sweet visions enchanting to meet us; But they pass from our sight like a bird in its flight, And are gone ere their gladness can greet us. Then, if buoyant in health, they deny us their wealth, And leave us to commonplace duties; Though with bliss Life is fraught, we scarce harbour a thought Of their wondrous though swift-fleeting beauties. While oft in our mind when their traces we find, We would pen their pure brilliance for others, But the glories we see, though entrancing they be, Are as nought in the eyes of our brothers. HISTORICAL PIECES. HUBERT. Scene I. —The garden of a Manor House on a summer evening. Dramatis Personæ. —Sir Ralph Harton, a frail old man, whose wife had been dead for years. Hubert, his only child in opening manhood. Time.—Immediately after the breaking out of the Civil War, 1642. Hubert. Hurrah! at length the people spring To vindicate their right, And vainly now shall strive the King To vanquish them in fight. At last Laud's long despotic course Draws ruin in its train, Soon Hampden's words of frenzied force The victory shall gain— While Charles will rue with deep remorse The part which he hath ta'en. For England's might shall rise in fight Throughout the groaning land— And War's harsh sound be heard around Our homes on every hand. Our wrongs shall be wiped out in gore, We'll vanquish what was vaunted, And so it shall be said once more That Britons are undaunted. Then shall we hold a Parliament Untrammelled, true, and free; The Stuart's line will aye repent Their deeds of tyranny. Secret intrigues shall not affright, Nor unordained taxation— And life will prove a dear delight To each one in the nation! Sir Ralph. And yet, my son, this coming strife Will yield us grievous woe; Though risking life where death is rife, God grant you ne'er may know The agony a father feels When from his fond child parted; Wounds such as these Time seldom heals, But leaves him broken-hearted. What anguish 'tis to separate When Nature's ties are nearest! Ah! cruel is the withering fate Which tears me from my dearest. Still go, my son, nor lingering stay, All private wishes must give way When the public weal in a righteous cause Demands a defence for our ancient laws. Yet even when the cause is one To which my thoughts respond, How hard it seems to lose thee, son; I long to gaze beyond The darkness which enshrouds thy lot Amid the surging strife— Of Gertrude, Hubert, think'st thou not? Gertrude thy promised wife. Her father hastes with all his men To take the monarch's side; Will he permit his daughter then To be a traitor's bride? Hubert. Lately on evening calm as this We met in woodland yonder, Sealing our troth with fervent kiss, Knowing we had grown fonder, Yet 'twas our lot to ponder On what, alas! we now must do; So sadly passed our interview, Feeling it was our parents' due, At least, that we should meet no more Until the present strife was o'er. And thus our pressing grief we strove to smother, By vowing constant faith to one another. So still to me is Gertrude dear, We do not part for ever; Then, father mine, thy spirit cheer, Though now we're forced to sever. Scene II. —A room in the Manor House. Hubert and Gertrude alone. Time.—Three years afterwards. Hubert. Alas! my honoured father dead, A blighting blow indeed has sped When I was absent; Gertrude, love, Thou seem'st a being from above Sent to relieve my crushing woe, By bliss which mortals rarely know. Few words may tell why I am here, In thy dear face delighting, Blessed be the cause which brings thee near, Our severed ties uniting. How weary is this woeful time Of pillaging and slaughter! No party deeming war a crime, Blood flowing fast as water. The golden grain one rarely sees That all are now requiring, Few buds upon the orchard trees, Which ruthless foes are firing, Shrieks of despair borne by the breeze Whence peasants are retiring. The hurried tramp of armèd men, The musketry's rude rattle, The cries and imprecations when Amid the brunt of battle. Such are the sounds which greet mine ear, Till, saddened with the fray, I come, my love, to rest me here, If only for a day. Gertrude. My story too is very brief, But 'tis a tale of truest grief. Ah! Hubert, I felt lone and drear When thou went'st forth to fight the foe, And none were left my soul to cheer Along its path of loveless woe. The links seemed loosed which brightly bound Our hopes and hearts in love profound. My father grew morose and stern, And harshly swore that I should learn My folly thus to thwart his will By loving a rebel Roundhead still, And that he would go forth and bring For me another lover— Who dauntlessly would serve the King, As I should soon discover. While thus beset on every side, With none to counsel or to guide, I scarce knew what I ought to do, Then to Sir Harton's house I flew, Craving protection there; And graciously with features pale He gravely listened to my tale, Granting me all my prayer. He let me take a daughter's part— Loving me dearly from his heart; But feebler grew he day by day, Dreaming of thee who wert away, Endangered in the deadly fray; And oft he longed as erst of yore To mount his stately steed once more To join thee in the field. But lacking strength, “Heaven's will be done, Though strong the yearning for my son, Whom God protect and shield.” I need not tell thee how his strength Stole stealthily away: at length He knew that death was near, And like a wan and sickly child, By sleep when blissfully beguiled, He died without a fear. Hubert. Thanks, Gertrude darling, for thy care, Ah! had I but been near to share Thy deep devotion to my sire, It had been more mine own desire, Than that by deeds of might my name Should win in war a soldier's fame. This is no time for honeyed word, Yet what from thy sweet lips I've heard Has bid me bless and love thee more Than in the peaceful days of yore. But, Gertrude, I must leave thee now— I may no longer tarry; For I my good steed must allow Three hours in which to carry His master unto his command Of Levellers the nearest band. The struggle now is nearly done, With Cromwell none can cope— When a great conflict has been won Gone is each royal hope. Thy sire and mother are in Spain (Having in safety crossed the main); Then with my vassals still abide, Nor from my home depart— Until I come to call thee bride With blithely beating heart. Oh! give me now a last embrace, One glance of thy bright eye Will nerve me aught on earth to face, Even though it be to die. Scene III. —Interior of a wretched hovel. Hubert lying wounded. Group of soldiers. Time.—A few days later. 1st Sol. 'Tis sad our captain too should feel The stroke of the Malignants' steel, In fight so fearless, brave, and bold, He scarcely seemed of mortal mould; And yet among the wounded he Would tender as a woman be. The dying heard with joy his tread, Invoking blessings on his head. So kind to all, so gentle too, He gave to each his proper due, And ever exercised his power To check us in a wanton hour. 2nd Sol. Cease, ere he wakes— Hubert. (Opening his eyes—) Why am I here, In this abode so bare and drear? Why this strange mist before mine eyes, Whence phantoms of the past arise? Why this weak trembling of the frame, And feelings which I cannot name? 1st Sol. Thou'rt wounded, Captain, but we feel Assured our leech thy hurt can heal. Hubert. Nevermore, my race is run, Here I shall not long remain, All my life on earth is done— Save, perchance, some hours of pain. (Delirious.) Gertrude darling, come to me, Even mid the din of strife. When shall I the dear day see When I rapturous call thee wife? (Again he is conscious.) Approach, my men, I grow more weak, My strength speeds swift away, Then promise me while yet I speak My mandate to obey. When I am dead, with charger fleet Unto my home repair, And tell the lady Gertrude sweet, My last thoughts were of her. And lay me where my fathers sleep, Within yon lone churchyard, Where the weird willow seems to keep A solitary guard. Farewell! I thank you from my heart For all the kindness on your part, May God— 1st Sol. See the celestial light Illume his features, as his spirit takes its flight. THE BATTLE OF LOUDONHILL. June 1st, 1679. The Scottish Presbyterians, forbidden by the arbitrary enactments of Charles II. to hold religious services according to their much-cherished manner, were fain to do so in secret. Graham of Claver-house, Viscount Dundee, has earned immortal infamy by the cruelties he exercised while dispersing these assemblies with his troopers. It is one of those occasions which is here attempted to be described. I. 'Tis Sabbath morn—fair Nature's face Showers smiles of freshly glowing grace On mountain, crag, and glen,— As if to prove to Him above Its silent share of lowly love Amid proud sullen men; And blithely birds chant loud their lays Of adoration and of praise. II. Much people from around are here, Yet with a mien of awe and fear,— But oft their faces seem to cheer As though some blessed boon were near. Women and men with one accord Are gathered now upon the sward, Vanished at once each petty feud,— They are resolved to serve the Lord In way which unto them seems good. III. “Have ye heard of that rash raid Ruthless Claverhouse has made?” Thus in accents firm yet low Oft they murmur to and fro— “He has ta'en of us the best, But he shall not seize the rest— Until at least we struggle sore To hold our own in fight, And pray amid the conflict's roar ‘For Scotland and the right.’ IV. “Why should the King dictate to us An alien way to serve the Lord? We will not bear such thrall, and thus Are met this day with one accord; Place sentinels on every hill To give us all fit warning due: Then put good trust in God's wise will And in our cause and weapons true.” V. “If our sweet sisters see the sign Of danger passed along the line Of distant scouts, they quit the glen,— The strife not left to craven men.” So speaks a patriarch in the midst, and now The congregation at God's footstool bow, And with united voices humbly there They plead for pardon and for peace in prayer. VI. Then plaintively they sing a psalm, And hear the “Word of Life;” Yet bodes around a baneful calm Presaging coming strife. For see! there hastes a messenger, Of toil-worn form but dauntless air: “Look to your ranks, rouse ye like men,— The black dragoons have gained the glen.” VII. Full speedily the men divide In companies, on either side According to their arms; A motley host indeed they seem, As now the sun's meridian beam Makes scythes and mattocks burnished gleam Among the weapons soldiers deem Fitter for war's alarms. VIII. The aged minister with head made bare Amid a solemn silence offers prayer; “Lord, spare the green and take the ripe; we know Thou rulest all things in this world of woe; Then grant but this and Scotland's just demand, Aught else we leave in Thy Almighty Hand.” IX. The pleading ends; each peasant hies His proper place to fill; Along their front a marsh there lies— Behind their post a hill. While resolutely thus they tread, Of father, mother, wife, Doubtless they think, yet dare the dread And danger of the strife, Feeling its issue will restore Freedom to their down-trodden shore. X. Lo! list to the sound which now bursts on the ear, A sound that full oft hath begotten wild fear— The prelude to plunder and rapine and woe, As all in the bold little army well know. Pricking swift as the billows when ploughed by the gale, While their steeds spurn the turf as they dash up the vale, The dragoons are seen moving, and every man Views the dark crest of Claverhouse leading the van. XI. “Now look to your carbines,” cries he with a laugh— “And each ranting rebel you'll scatter like chaff, The harvest is over, the thrashers are come, With swords for their flails, for their music a drum, And your famous leech-craft will certainly heal The festering wound of the Covenant's zeal.” XII. Sharp comes the volley—from the vale Shrouded in sable smoke Strange sounds arise; and when a wail Pierces its cloud-wrapt cloak, Perchance it is a sign that one Ends there his earthly strife— His lowly race at last hath run, Entering eternal life. Perchance a sign that one of those Who scoffed and had no fear, His summons come, reluctant goes Before God to appear. XIII. Yet still the peasants ne'er o'erthrown With patient courage hold their own; Try as they may, the soldiers see They win not thus the victory. So Claverhouse recalls each man Till he direct some further plan, The lines upon his stubborn face Showing he feels the dire disgrace That well-tried troops—false Charles's boast— Should vanquished be by peasant host. XIV. But soon enraged he orders all The cavalry within his call Full at the charge with frenzied force Across the moss to take their course, Seeking to make the rout complete By crushing all beneath their feet. And gallantly the men advance With pointed sword, and glittering lance, And crests which in the sun-beams dance. XV. But every effort is in vain, And steeds, though guided by the rein, Are all around fast falling; And their fierce foemen now are closing Thick in upon them, and opposing, Their ranks now past recalling. The marsh has stopped their march indeed There can be no denying, And many a man and many a steed Dyed darkly now lie dying. And all their splendour melts away Like dew-drops at the dawn of day. XVI. Like as a vulture when bereft of prey Long hovers ere it baffled soars away, Stern Claverhouse had waited thus in vain, Till now he turns his rampant charger's rein; Shouting, in his rough voice, the loud command, “Retreat,” unto the remnant of his band XVII. And thus the victory is won, And many hearts made glad— Yet grieving that a Sabbath's sun Should see a sight so sad. And well they know they have not broke The rigour of the Despot's yoke, And oft they pause and ponder wearily On what must hap ere Scotland can be free. XVIII. Loudon! thy fame shall ne'er be lost, Even if it only showed the cost Our fathers paid for Liberty, That priceless jewel of the free, Thus nerving us with effort strong To combat Tyranny and Wrong. AN EPISODE IN THE BATTLE OF FUENTES D'HONORE. 1811. The horse of the armies, in hostile array, Haste to prove their proud prowess in mortal affray— And the soldiers' fierce oaths that are bandied around Add a fresh sense of horror to battle's stern sound. Thus the squadrons are nearing each other, when lo! An hussar leaves our line and makes straight for the foe, And stung by his tauntings to furious force, Direct at one soldier he urges his horse— Who, seeing such frenzy of hate with sore fear, Sets spurs to his steed, and swift speeds for the rear, While the other his charger gives rashly the rein, And both gallop recklessly over the plain. Our men greet their comrade with cheers long and loud, While the French are struck mute as he flies through their crowd; So the chase is continued far, far, in advance Of the glancing of bayonet or glittering of lance; Yet our gallant hussar is in perilous plight, The enemy near him—no friends now in sight: And to reach his companions perforce he must go Through the densely ranged ranks of the furious foe— Who, deeming their victory a certainty, vow Though he passed their line once, he will not pass it now. And hard they press on him—escape seems in vain, Though he spur his steed onward with loose slackened rein. But the men of his regiment are anxious to save A comrade, though reckless, thus daring and brave; So, drawing their sabres, swift forward they dash And charge on the cowards with crest-cleaving crash. Thus the moment which seemed his sad fate to have sealed A goodly array of our soldiers revealed, And amid the mad melée of general strife He regained his companions with honour and life. DEVOTION OF PRINCE PONIATOWSKI. Leipsic, 1813. Bravely the French have fought, but all by treachery is lost, And nought is left save to retreat, though now at fearful cost; In gloomy tones Napoleon gives the unfamiliar word— With curses on the enemy it everywhere is heard; “And you, Prince Poniatowski, keep the Southern Faubourg, while Across the Pleisse and Elster the vanguard can defile.” “My men are few, your Majesty; they must in time give way.” “Still you will surely strive to hold the post as best you may.” “Doubt us not, sire, we'll keep good guard,” speaks he with a deep sigh. “None of my Polish legion but for you would gladly die.” The morning light soon growing bright, shows clearly to the foe The French retreat has now commenced, though sad and strangely slow; And columns of the Allies advance to do their duty By dashing on to devastate a scene once filled with beauty; But gallantly their rushing ranks the brave rearguard restrain, Full long their valiant charge is vain an entrance to obtain, And when, but step by step, the bold defenders are retiring, 'Tis whilst resisting steadfastly with still continued firing; All their companions now have crossed a broad bridge which is mined— If they can pass securely o'er, they soon may safety find. Hark to the sudden hellish crash! these heroes' hope has gone! The mine has prematurely burst—the careless stream rolls on; The people fire from off the roofs, the foe press on the rear, A moment 'tis of agony, of overwhelming fear. Proud Poniatowski sees the flash of hostile sabres rise, And to his Polish cuirassiers, he petulantly cries— “'Tis best to fall with honour now while each his weapon plies.” Turning his horse, he shapes his course 'mong bayonets all opposing, Around his stalwart martial form the enemy are closing— One shot has smote him in the arm, another midst his dress, Striking the gay insignia which his great renown express. He plunges madly through the Pleisse, the strength at his command Is perfectly exhausted ere he feebly gains the land; Alas! 'tis but to mark the foe thronging the Elster's shore, And leaping swift into its tide, he sinks to rise no more. Farewell, lost Poland's noble son! how meet the day would be Whereon the land which gave thee birth once more was rendered free. DUTY STRONGER THAN PAIN. 1795. The good ship Rose with thirteen men and but eight guns is steering Along the gay Italian coast, in quest of privateering, When at the breaking of the day before upon the lee What gallantly her crew have sought at last they gladly see. Three armed feluccas are in view, and soon begins the fight, And the ruthless Rose her broadside fires with overwhelming might, For valiantly her noble crew with vigour ply each gun, When suddenly a shot lays low of their small number, one; His foot is crushed, and eager hands would bear him from the deck, But with a voice which falters not he seeks their care to check— “I shall not leave you, comrades bold,” heroically he cries, “For I can use a musket still, although I cannot rise; Then to your posts, nor think of me, our numbers are too few To spare even one, and readily my duty I can do.” The battle rages bravely on, and soon 'tis clear to see That gallantly our doughty men have gained the victory— And was it aught of wonder that so it should be when Such fearless hearts impelled the hands of our staunch sailors then? God grant that if once more our tars should fight upon the wave, They may be then as free from fear, as generous, and as brave. A SEA ENCOUNTER. 1758. The gallant ships Southampton and Melampe brave the gale In noble guise, as mutually they forth together sail, With massive mast bent to the blast, and canvas full and free, A stirring sight they seem—befitting well an English sea— With many blithesome hearts on board as heedless and as gay As if Life were merely made for mirth—nought save a holiday. And now, behold, off Yarmouth roads there burst upon their sight Two Gallic frigates in full sail, which they resolve to fight. The Melampe is the swifter barque, and fastest gains the foe, Who to return her fusillade with interest are not slow— So ere the crew of the Southampton reach the strife, they learn In a distressed disabled state she has been forced astern; Then, like a dastard, one French ship in dread doth steer away, But madly the Southampton's guns upon the other play Like monsters of destruction, who cannot brook delay. The French engage with reckless rage—the fight grows hour by hour, Each vessel's crew, with purpose true, striving with passion's power; Each seaman seeking still to keep the honour of his nation By carrying mid the hostile ranks dire woe and desolation; And the hissing roar of rushing shell and the blinding red-hot hail, All demonstrate what dreadful force they now use to prevail. Hour after hour thus passes swift in unremitting strife, And of the French full eighty men have yielded up their life— But as the sixth hour draweth on they suddenly give way, Their falling flag proclaiming wide that they have lost the day. We trust such times as these shall ne'er again mar Britain's story, Yet bravery, howe'er displayed, shall aye retain its glory.</field>
