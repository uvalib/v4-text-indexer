      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable PEREGRINE, Lord Marquis of Caermarthen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mr. PACKER: Upon his Improving a Room in Donnington-Castle, suppos'd to have been Chaucer's STUDY. Multa renascentur, quæ jam cecidere; cadentq; Quæ nunc sunt in Honore? Hor. Art. Poet. Chaucer, as Fame in Deathless Annals sings, Successively was Laureat to Three Kings: Apollo did Himself his Priest ordain, And made Him Flamen of Their Triple Reign; In Love and Arms He grac'd the British Throne, Increas'd Their Laurels much, but more His own; In Honour's Chase They lagg'd behind His Thought; The Bard wrote bolder than His Heroes fought. Such were His Praises;—Such His Honours now, Which, on Himself, Himself could best bestow. His Glorious Works must far extend His Name; Immortal Wit demands Immortal Fame: His faithful Structures of facetious Rhime, Secure, withstand the fiercest Shocks of Time; And cruel Saturn has that Mercy shown, To spare His Children, who devour'd his own. But tho' the Muses may elude the Rage And ineffectual Batteries of Age, The tuneful Choir can no Protection bring, Or guard the Nest, where they first learn'd to Sing. What Phœbus, and the Nine in vain pursue, Is a peculiar Task reserv'd for You: Wise Heaven's Design is by Your Care fulfill'd; You in few Days the Sacred Walls rebuild, And to its former Dignity restore, What many Ages scarce destroy'd before; You, and the Muse each other's Wrongs repair; The Muse is Your's, and You the Muse's Care. Our Ancient Father of the British Song, In Dryden late reviv'd, again grows young: His Tales are there in freshest Language told, Like Coins new-stamp'd on old Spur-royal Gold. You, and His Muse Applauses justly claim, Both gen'rous Benefactors to His Fame; The pleasing Task on either Part is great, Dryden improves His Rhimes, and You His Seat. The Muses, and the Muse-inspiring God, Shall now revisit Their belov'd Abode; While Cytherea, and Her nightly Train Of smiling Graces, bless the flow'ry Plain. Fair Venus the Mysterious Dance shall lead, Light-tripping Elves their airy Measures tread, And leave Fantastick Rounds in ev'ry Fairy Mead. No Fire shall wander with delusive Light, No grisly Ghost, no Forms obscene affright, Or discompose the Revels of the Night: Pleasure with Mirth, and Laughter here shall stay, The Night to shorten, and prolong the Day. Hark! how the Birds from their Poetick Throats, Sing more divinely, and in sweeter Notes; Rivals they strive each other to excel, And ev'ry Thrush is here a Philomel: Their great Instructor's Lays employ each Tongue, By Chaucer taught, of Chaucer is their Song. Old Greece, and Rome religiously are said To glean the Reliques of their mighty Dead; With learned Care their Antiquaries sought The smallest Fragments which their Poets wrote; Pieces that with diviner Fires were warm'd, Oracular the Sense, and ev'ry Word was charm'd. Thus You preserve (so knowing Fate ordains) This venerable Mansion's great Remains: Monarchs may Louvres, Princes Blenheims raise; Their Fame is louder, but more just Your Praise: The more important Labours better please Of building Temples, than proud Palaces. Threat'ning the Skies This lofty Fabrick stands, And all below the distant Plain commands: High, without Pride, Majestick, without State, Strong in Decay, amidst its Ruins, Great. Thy fruitful Walls with equal Pride produce The Warrior-Hero, and recording Muse. Lavish of Fame, we're by Thy Story taught How Chaucer sung, and Boys His Valour fought. But (O!)—'twou'd grieve a Loyal Muse to sing Of Men, and Arms rebellious to their King; Of curs'd Newburian Fields,—whose guilty Plain Rose hilly with the Numbers of the Slain: By an unequal Fate, and Fortune's Crime, Falkland was snatch'd from hence before his Time; The Hero perish'd in the Bloom of Youth, In Letters old, in Loyalty, and Truth: Pity the Gods his Life refus'd to spare; But Heav'n impatient seem'd till He was there. Honour he lov'd; bright Honour that proceeds From Virtuous Actions, and Heroick Deeds: His dauntless Heart in Arms conceiv'd no Fear, Except to be far off, and not to hear When Honour call'd, and Glorious Danger near. Knowledge He sought—but not in Courts to rise; He was ambitious—only to be wise: Such great Accomplishments the Chief engross't, To save Him, Empires had been cheaply lost. Here fell Carnarvan, an Illustrious Name, In Blood superior, and his Match in Fame: He fell,—to vulgar Hands resign'd his Breath; Ingloriously he fell,—but dy'd a Glorious Death. From hence a tow'ring Palace may be seen, The promis'd Court of a Bohemian Queen; The spacious Building, ample Walls, contain More Land than bounds a Petty Prince's Reign. The Sun that daily runs th' Ethereal Round, With weary'd Steps surveys the vast Extent of Ground. Had Dido been with such Dominions blest, She had not lost so soon her Trojan Guest; The faithless Hero had not prov'd unkind, Nor rudely left the weeping Fair behind. In this stupendous Pile we find express'd The large Ideas of a Princely Breast: But gilded Roofs no Pattern can afford, Or form an Image of their present Lord; Well-fashion'd Marbles Life to others give, But His superior Worth makes Marbles live; Does the more gen'rous Monuments impart Of open Hands, and an unbounded Heart. With secret Pleasure I am now convey'd, To seek fair Benham's hospitable Shade, Whose Beauties, like a blushing Virgin, fly The common View, nor court the publick Eye: Noble, yet plain, with unaffected Grace, Resembling well the Masters of the Place. Here They in Peace enjoy unenvy'd Wealth, Unbroken Slumbers, and unphysick'd Health. Their equal Souls by Sympathy are grown In Wills, Affections, and strict Friendship, one; And like two Strings that warble the same Note, By Turns resound an Unison of Thought. When you shall consecrate the hallow'd Shrine With Jolly Songs, and Goblets crown'd with Wine, My Friends shall in the Dithyrambick Chorus joyn; Whilst Chaucer's Shade shall answer from below, Mix with the Pomp, and grace the solemn Show. And if the fam'd Amphions wond'rous Lyre, Would graciously assist the chearful Quire, His charming Lays might teach you to repair The nodding Ruins with a Grecian Air: Who by his chorded Shells enchanting Sound, Made Marble Quarries heave, and burst the Ground; Then from a rude, and indigested Heap, Into a new, and beauteous Order leap. In num'rous Figures rang'd, they danc'd along, To City's form'd by his attractive Song, The willing Stones into the Wall were wrought, Harmoniously proportion'd to each Note; And thus by Verse in Architecture skill'd, Without an Artist, taught themselves to build. O could my Muse in Epick Numbers write, Some famous Tale, like that of Chaucer's Knight, You, Sir, the noble Palamon should be, Your beauteous Consort the fair Emely. On a Lady's Needle. Say, well-form'd Piece of pointed Steel, Why should Her Hands thy Malice feel; Her Iv'ry Hands that whiter show Than new-born Lilly's native Snow: Her Hands proud Scepters fram'd to sway, And teach their Monarchs to obey? Or tell me, Needle, why should'st thou Her slender Fingers injure so? Thy polish'd Point, there rashly stain, And purchase Guilt to give her Pain? In vain thou dost those Fingers gore, By Suff'ring they're enrich'd the more: The Crimson Drops, that round them stand, In Rubies swell to grace her Hand; The Drops thy impious Rage has shed Are more divine than Venus bled; The greatest Prince that fills a Throne To save that Blood, would lose his own. Did she not thy rude Motions guide, Thy curious Works, embroider'd Pride, Must all have uncommended dy'd: In ev'ry Flow'r Her Fancies shine, The Art all Hers, the Glory thine: To thee since so obliging found, How can Her Hands deserve the Wound? Ah! then, fond little Lance, forbear To vex those Hands, those Fingers spare: But if thou wouldst propitious prove, Chastise Her Heart, teach That to love; There all thy boasted Forces try, There thy envenom'd Sting apply; Deep,—deeply let it be imprest, Till thrilling Vengeance pierce Her Breast; Her Breast that's more relentless far Than sensless Rocks, or Marbles are. If thou canst move Compassion there, Or mollify the cruel Fair, Gods!—what proud Trophies will I raise To thee of Gratitude, and Praise. Then may'st thou boast thou dost excel The God of Love in aiming well, Who never yet cou'd speed a Dart, Or wing a Wound to reach Her Heart. To the Honourable The Lady MARY BERTIE, OCCASION'D By Her Immoderate Grief for the Death of Her Brother. ? quem semper acerbum Semper honoratum (sic Di voluistis) habebo. Madam, If frequent Groans, and never-ceasing Sighs, If big-descending Drops, and show'ry Eyes Had force to make Your vanish'd Joys return, Or mitigate the Evils which you mourn, Well might You give (nor think the Purchase dear,) A precious Gem for ev'ry falling Tear. As in the Fields the springing Blade shoots high, Sprinkl'd with Dews that drizle from the Sky; So wat'ry Tears feed Sorrow, and bestow A secret Vegetation on our Woe. Nature perversly our Desires has cross'd; We thus prize Jewels chiefly when they're lost: To cooling Shades from Summers Heat we run, But hasten to approach the Winter Sun. You matchless Beauty boast, and sprightly Health, Friends nobly born, and large Supplies of Wealth, Vot'rys that sweet Idolatry pursue, And steal their Eyes from Heav'n to worship You: Yet the dull Hours You pensively employ, Blacken the Thought, and sadden all your Joy. What has the Noble Lord Your Brother done, To be unkindly thus forgot so soon? What Your surviving Friends, who weeping seem To mourn for You, as You lament for Him? So some fond Nymph, one fav'rite Flow'r deceas'd' Doats on its Ruins, and neglects the rest; And thus while pious Tears You vainly shed, You wrong the Living, mourning for the Dead. Passion improves to Rage by length of Time, And what was Passion, now becomes a Crime: Grief, fed by Sighs, imperious grows, and strong, And tyrannizes when it reigns too long. You most unjust and avaricious grow, Thus to engross our common Stock of Woe: To Publick Loss a Gen'ral Grief is due, Too Universal to be paid by You. There are who may in Rival Cares contend, You mourn a Brother,—I lament the Friend. O! that a Mortal might like Orpheus go Free, and unpunish'd to the Shades below, I'd sing in such a sadly-moving Strain, The Ghosts all list'ning jointly shou'd complain, Forget their Torments, and attend my Pain: My Song shou'd teach the Furies to grow tame, Dismount their Torches, and uncurl their Flame. Nor wou'd I cease my plaintive Airs to sing, 'Till I had vanquish'd their tremendous King, His Passport gain'd for Charon to restore The Fugitive, and land Him on our Shore. You hover o're His Tomb, exclaiming there Enough to cause the sleeping Dead to hear; With hollow Groans the Vaults around complain, And as You weep, the Marbles weep again. So Love's soft Goddess, young Adonis lost, Follows with Cries to catch his flying Ghost; Her fruitless Tears the flitting Boy pursue, The Youth less lovely, She less fair than You. Whereever Beauty in Distress is found, Pity prepares us to receive the Wound. Ruffl'd by Passion it exerts the more, And grows a greater Tyrant than before: So on destructive Wings red Lightnings fly, And flash severely from a stormy Sky. Those Mourning Weeds Your lovely Charms refine, Worn as a Foil to make the Jewel shine, Rev'rence to You, to Us they Wonder bring, First we admir'd,—now fall to Worshipping. Clad in a Veil of Raven-glossy Hair, Great Julius own'd his Cleopatra fair; Her Olive Beauties, in deep Shadow set, Gain'd more Advantage from their native Jet: Thus on Enamell'd Rings we may behold The sable Strokes give Lustre to the Gold. She justly cou'd a Nobler Empire boast In Cæsar's Heart, than Ptolomy had lost; Nor cou'd the Conqu'ring Roman Eagle fly To Glorious Conquests, swifter than Her Eye. When Ancient Bards a Sov'raign Pow'r wou'd draw With Majesty, to keep the World in Awe, They did their Jove in Robes of Darkness shroud, And made the Godhead thunder from a Cloud. Exempt from this alone, You cannot save His dear Remains now mould'ring in the Grave; You may as well demand, when Day is done, A Rising Morning from the Setting Sun. As Phœbus does his dying Beams renew, So shall He mount, and greater Glory shew, Clad in diviner Fires shall upward fly, And shine superior in a brighter Sky. Here shall He ever live, for ever blest; Nothing but Your Disquiet can molest His Endless Joys, or interrupt His Rest: O! let Him undisturb'd those Pleasures share, That cannot greater be—till You are there. A Solitary Canto To CHLORIS the Disdainful. What a Pox do you mean with your Pride and Ill-Nature, Like a Jilt to neglect thus your own and God's Creature? You idly mistake the Design of a Lover, His Bus'ness is Action, much more than to Suffer. 'Tis a Barb'rous Return, a Hellish Disdain, To requite all the Pleasure I offer with Pain. Didst Thou come of some rough-hewn Northumberland Breed, Wer't Thou got, and brought forth on the Banks of far Tweed, There damn'd to the Yoke, and tyrannical Rule Of some jealous old Huncks, or suspicious young Fool, Yet methinks You might find some Expedient or other, Tho' You knew nothing of it—to bring Us together; And not thus to let a brisk likely young Fellow To bulk it, or use the hard Ground for a Pillow. No, Madam, in good Faith, I came not to fool here, Or court, You may guess, the North-Wind for a Cooler: My Bus'ness is—Let me come in, and I warrant You'll say I know how to deliver my Errand. What a Devil d' y' think I'll stand here like an Ass, And with Knuckle lie drumming on Pane of small Glass? Or Coxcomb that fancies he shrewdly does nick it, When his Passion in Sighs he conveys thro' the Wicket? All th' amorous Rout of the Curs in the Town Are in loud Irish Howl Serenading the Moon, But Cynthia the Kind condescends to each Span'el, While in Pity She graciously shines from the Kennel. Grave Owls, Night's wing'd Lovers, fly over our Head, And with Screaming in Church-Yards awaken the Dead; But You, cruel Nymph, while Your Grace I'm imploring, My Ditty ne're mind, but in Blanket lie snoring. Hark! how the Winds roar, my Misfortunes condoling, While I lie at Your Door all the Night Caterwauling; And as of complaining soft Flute I make Tryal, They dolefully whistle in Consort thro' Key-hole. The Ground's cas'd with Ice, and the whole Street a Glass is For the Moon and the Stars to behold their bright Faces; The Season's so sharp, one wou'd swear the Cold reigns In Your Blood, and has froze up Your Heart and Your Veins, And like little St. Francis enamour'd I grow Of a Damsel of Ice, or a Mistress of Snow. Come lay by this Scorn You so fondly affect, Your unchristian Behaviour, and heath'nish Neglect, Lest the Pow'rs of Love, their just Vengeance to show, Make You doat on an Ass, or some nauseous old Beau, Who, to balk and torment You, Your Court shall decline, And scorn Your Addresses, as You have done mine. Thy Mother was courteous before Thee, and Nature Entails Her good Qualities all on the Daughter: No longer then dream on those dull idle Fancies Of Honour, ne're found but in Plays and Romances; Nor that Græcian Jilt who a fair Thread did twist off, And stood with her Sparks at close Guard with her Distaff. Have I not set Traps, and laid many a Gin With Springes to noose You, and catch your Heart in? Ha'nt I wheedl'd, presented, and offer'd Petitions, In Order to bring You to milder Conditions? Your Chamber-Maid fee'd with my Person, and Money, To know how your Pulse beat, and practise upon Ye? Been religiously drunk at all Times, and all Places, By Spelling your Name o're in Stum in Beer-Glasses? Beside what might plague You, and touch your Heart more near, Thy Spouse now solaces with Doxy in Corner, Melodious Stage-Punk, whose bewitching sweet Tongue Does lewdly seduce his false Heart with a Song; And if this one mortifying Thought will not win ye, Nor raise your dull Spleen—why the Devil is in ye. In Turky the Wives, and Mahometan Beauties, If their Husbands neglect to do Family-Duties, Those Heralds of Cupid conclude it but decent, T' ennoble their Family's Coat with a Crescent; And sure 'tis not fit Christian Ladies shou'd want A Freedom, that Love does to Infidels grant. I've lain down before You already too long, In Hopes I might take You—with Fiddle and Song; Then prithee, Dear Chloris, be gentle and coming, While Love is in Humour, and Youth is a blooming. When Age comes 'twill make me too wise to endure The Delays, and Fatigues of a tedious Amour; Believe me, I ne're shall have Patience hereafter To stand like a Cistern to catch your Rain-Water, Nor at your Door whimper, bewailing my Fate, While it falls in big Drops from the Eaves of my Hat; No, sweet Mrs. Chloris—pray excuse me for that. The Ingrate. Ungrateful Fair! can You despise The Slave, who so admires those Eyes? Can You from his dear Arms depart, From Love and Him estrange your Heart? Your Heart, that does too faithless prove To entertain his constant Love? Ah! Cruel Nymph! to whom is giv'n A Form more bright, more proud than Heav'n; Whose scornful Soul, and haughty Breast, Disdain to make a God their Guest. And must I bear your cold Disdain, While You but laugh at all my Pain? No.—I will triumph in my Turn, And I will laugh, while You shall mourn, And render Pride for Pride, and Scorn for Scorn. Then fare You well, a long Adieu To all your Pride, your Scorn, and You. My Muse shall now no more rehearse, Nor grace thy Beauties with my Verse; Unworthy of my Songs of Praise, And all my sweet harmonious Lays: Then once more thus I bid Adieu To all your Pride, your Scorn, and You. For why shou'd You the Heart despise, That bright Lucinda deigns to prize? Lucinda the kind tempting Fair, Of all our Youth the publick Care; Whose Cheeks the sweetest Blossoms yield That smile in blooming Beauty's Field; She boldly makes my Heart Her Claim, She burns, and glories in the Flame; To me She gives up all Her Charms, And melting drops into my Arms. Already, fam'd by my soft Song, She warms the Old, and fires the Young; My wanton Song, that soars so high, It proudly lifts Her to the Sky, To Heav'n Her am'rous Fire prefers, And bids it there outshine the Stars. Forsaken thus, how will You mourn! How will You now accuse your Scorn! And urg'd by secret Grief complain, While Tears upbraid your past Disdain. But You, in vain, shall weep and mourn; In vain shall Tears upbraid your Scorn; For I will mind your Sighs, and Tears no more, Than You, proud Nymph, regarded mine before. A Cannibal's Love-Song. See Montaign's Essays, Chap. 30. Vol. I. Stay, Adder, Gentle Adder, stay, Ah! glide not in such Haste away: That from thy painted Mazes, roll'd In many a various-colour'd Fold Of burnish'd Wreaths, and speckl'd Gold, My Sister may with Art prepare A Garland to present my Fair: A Garland that secure may bind Her Tresses from the ruffling Wind. Stay, Adder, Gentle Adder, stay, Ah! glide not in such Haste away. So may thy sleek enamel'd Coat Of damask'd Scales, in Order wrought, Out-shine, with a superior Grace, The Pride of all thy snaky Race, So shall thy Beauties ever be By Lovers prais'd, ador'd by me. Stay, Adder, &amp;c. ON The Shortness of Life, AND The Miseries that attend it. Optima quæq; dies miseris mortalibus ævi Prima fugit: subeunt morbi, tristisq; senectus, Et labor, &amp; duræ rapit inclementia mortis. I. Unhappy Man! the Boast of Nature born: Who whilst, ambitious to be fear'd, Thou scorn'st thy Fellow-Creatures of the Herd, Art made thy Self no less their Scorn. Yet, proud aspiring Dust, wilt thou Assume the Empire of the World below, Thy patrimonial Globe to sway, Before thee form'd of præexistent Clay? The humble Earth you insolently tread, The Fleece, the Furrow, and the Field Warm Cloathing, and Subsistence yield, And bounteously allow thee Bread. “But Godlike Man! his Charter is divine, “From Heav'n his Tenure, and that Tenure's thine. “Th' expanded Air, the Land, the Sea “Thy Tenants are, and jointly hold from thee: But tho' you vaunt with Heav'n the World to share, The Gentle Flocks, and Savage Herds, The Wild, and Tamer Beasts, and Birds, Thy Benefactors all, and elder Brethren are. This young vain-glorious Ammon's Son, Who dreams that he the vanquish'd World has won, Is by his Captives led in Chains; And subject to the Slaves o're which he reigns. His own Rebellious Creatures disobey, To ev'ry Reptil made, and ev'ry Worm, a Prey. II. While yet the Parts unfinish'd are, and rude, Before the nitrous Air has ting'd the watry Blood, Weak Nature conscious trembles at the Doom Of Heav'ns Decrees, and Punishments to come. Death like a Spy employ'd by th' envious Fates, Upon the Birth of Motion waits, And e're we fully live, it often uncreates. Nor yet alas! do we alone Beneath th' oppressive Torments groan, But fruitful of the Pains we undergo, We propagate our Ills, and multiply our Woe. While wrapt in Secondine the Embryo lies, 'Tis blasted with unwholsom Sighs; Thus Infants with the Parents mourn, Who back again the mutual Griefs return, And sympathetick Tears infect the Mother's Eyes. With Pangs, and Throws into the World we come, The Curse, and Burthen of the Womb: The Dawn of Life its Part of Torment shares, Discover'd first by Cries, and introduc'd with Tears. III. Like some fleet Arrow from a Parthian Bow With Fury drawn, to charge the following Foe, Thro' pathless Air we haste; Which by no Track discovers where we past. Along th' impetuous Course of Life we fly, Life, the Assurance Mankind has to die; Short-winded Life, unable far to run, Which almost ends where it begun, It starts, and lo! the momentary Race is done. The first Advance we make approaches Death, And we draw Air to render back our Breath. As swift as Time our Age posts on, As swift as Time alas 'tis gone, And as the hasty Minutes pass, The ebbing Sand creeps lower in the Glass. The Body lightn'd of its Weight, Prepares us for our speedy Flight; The Hours our Substance on their Wings convey, Insensibly they steal us from our selves away. IV. To Time's victorious Scythe we all A sudden Trophy fall. Large Heaps he mows, thro' wide Destruction flies, While Ruin in large Swarths around him lies. Thus in the Spring some loud tempestuous Blast Sweeps o're the Plain, and lays whole Nature waste; Trees, Plants, and Flow'rs promiscuously are spread, And on the Womb, that gave them Birth, lie dead. So swift the Blow, the Flow'rs awhile Forget to wither, and in Death they smile, Their Beauties seemingly retain, As if again they grew, and flourish'd there again. V. The Bubble Life does gawdy Colours show, Like those that paint the Heav'nly Bow; Which on a watry Cloud appears, A spangl'd Vapour dropt with shining Tears. Tho' in the setting Sky departing Light Forewarns us of approaching Night, We idly dream one feeble Ray Has Pow'r to reinforce the Day; And fancy we extend the Line, The Shadows lengthning, as the Beams decline. Thus by Appearances we are betray'd, Deluded by the Image of a Shade, Which fondly we admire, till with the Sun It vanishes, and streight the mighty Phantom's gone. VI. As Life is short, 'tis full of Troubles too. What num'rous Plagues Mankind pursue? Between the Womb, and neighb'ring Grave, We scarce from Pain a Moment's Respite have; Nor living can we hope for a Release, Since with our Years our Miseries increase. We rowl this Ball with Sisyphus's Fate, Lab'ring beneath the dull unactive Weight; With our collected Pow'rs we first urge on The sluggish, and unweildy Stone; The pond'rous Mass creeps up the Race With lazy Motion, and unwilling Pace, And as the lifted Orb still higher climbs, It breaks our Vigor, and unnerves the Limbs: We faint, that falling with redoubl'd Might Crushes our Frame in the revolving Flight; Down the Descent it scowrs with rapid Force, Rowling in Dust, and Smoke along the furious Course. VII. Few are our Days, and painful; yet fond Man Will stretch his lengthen'd Hopes beyond his Span: And as the num'rous Torments sent, Were insufficient, He to increase th' unhappy Store, Still seeks out new, and adds a Thousand more. See but what different Courses Mortals run! What certain Measures take to be undone! We all pursue the various Game Of Honour, Pleasure, Wealth, and Fame; We roam thro' lonely Wilds, and devious Ways, Lost in the doubling World's mysterious Maze; Condemn'd to suffer Life, we're now betray'd To drag the Fetters which our Follies made: We struggle, and we strive in vain To break our Prison, or dissolve our Chain; The grisly King of Terrors sets us free, He only can confer a General Goal-Delivery. VIII. We here consume in Noise, and Strife, The Oyl design'd to feed the Lamp of Life. By starts it flares awhile with dubious Fires, Then with a Blaze ascends, and lost in Smoke expires. The Seeds of Change in ev'ry Part we bear, The fighting Elements now jar, And all within us raise a Civil War; Troops of Diseases grim, and pale, The Ramparts, and the Walls assail, Th' external Works they batter down, The Soul within affrighted flies, and quits the Town. IX. In secret Beds the Body's Earth contains More teeming Seeds of sprouting Pains, More complicated Plagues, than fill The dreadful Bead-roll of the Weekly Bill. To keep the destin'd Prey in view, Infectious Atoms swim the Crimson Flood, Thro' purple-winding Streams pursue, Till hunted down it stagnates in the Blood. The Limb-tormenting Gout with tardy Pace O'retakes the nimblest in the Race: Bound Hand and Foot in Chains we lie, Unable to defend ourselves, or flie. Thro' all the Parts the wide Contagion's spread, Till by degrees it mounts into the Head, And as it racks the tortur'd Brain, The Victim in the Capitol lies slain, The knotted Joints distorted with convulsive Pain. With Eyes inflam'd now scorching Fevers rage. Kindl'd by Pestilential Heat The Juice ferments, and throbbing Art'ries beat, No Juleps cool, nor can Ptisans asswage. The bloodshot Orbs with glowing Beams look red, Like Basilisks they glare, and strike us dead. Within an unseen Ætna reigns, Which hidden Nourishment contains, Of liquid Burnings sluic'd thro' parching Veins. Thus when a Bomb red Vengeance pours On some beleaguer'd City's blazing Tow'rs, The Soldiers from th' unguarded Fort retire, The Magazine in Flames, and Citadel on Fire. X. These our Domesticks are, ordain'd by Fate On Life, th' Original Disease, to wait: With an innumerable Train behind Of Ghastly Maladies, assign'd A sad Retinue to attend Mankind. All Industry, all Arts in vain are try'd, No Mole can hinder the departing Tide. Not the Physician can ensure, Th'inevitable Urn admits no Cure. Tho' Frampton, Æsculapius of the Age, Shou'd in th' unequal Task engage, Our Athens best Apollo scarce wou'd be Sufficient to reverse the firm Decree Of unrelenting Destiny. Frampton, whom Heav'n did in Compassion give, Our Publick Fund of Health, and best Preservative. Who does each secret Virtue know Of Leaf, of Blossom, and of Fruit that grow On Intellectual Branch, or Vital Bough; Who from the Jaws of Death shall rescue more, Than all his Predecessors slew before. The Time will come, O! may that Time be late, When He the Good, the Gen'rous, and the Great, Must reascend his Bright, Hereditary Seat, And propitiously from thence Reviving Lustre shall dispense, And shed down salutary Influence. There He with Harvey, Sydenham, Ent shall go Into a League, confed'rate Aid bestow, And with superior Arts relieve the suppliant World below. XI. Yet while on Earth he strives to join Unweary'd Care, to Skill Divine, Does ev'ry Healing Juice employ, Contending to restore, Death labours to destroy. Fearing his Skill, and jealous of his Art, Th' unerring Shaft is level'd at his Heart: The silent Dart unseen steals on, He trembles, faints, looks pale, is gone, Neglects his Patients Life to guard his own: Thus while h'extends his pious Hands to save, Ev'n He himself must grace the Triumphs of the Grave. The Force of WINE: A DITHYRAMBICK. Dulce Periculum est O Lenæe, sequi Deum Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. Ode 25. Lib. 3. 1. Bacchus, Patron of the Vine, God of Mirth, and God of Wine, Bath my thirsty Temples o're, And let me drink at ev'ry Pore. As thy transporting Joys I sing, With Genial Lays my Breast inspire: Then bid Silenus strike the silent Lyre; While with Thee in the Antick Sound, The nimble Satyrs frisk, and bound, And in loud Dithyrambick Strains rouse ev'ry silent String. 2. Hark! hark! the sleeping Strings awake! With Fury Divine see! see! how they shake! The jolly Notes, and drunken Words confus'dly roll along, And dance, and leap into my Verse, and reel into my Song. 3. Wine makes a Monarch of the Slave, The Beggar rich, the Coward brave, The Pris'ner thus his Freedom gains, It kindly bails him, and shakes off his Chains. 4. Who ever did of Poverty complain, When gen'rous Burgundy had fir'd his Brain? It gilds the Thought with Chymick Art, And into Riches stamps, and coins the Heart; The Language down like Tagus Flood is roll'd, And glitters with imaginary Gold. 5. When we rosy Chaplets wear, And fragrant Oyls perfume the Hair; When the lusty Bowl goes round, With ruddy Foam of sparkling Nectar crown'd; The Merchant laughs at all his Toils, Forgets his Danger, and his Sorrow smiles. Now, now, he bids farewel to Care, And Anguish of the Mind, That hover round him in the Air, And flutter in the Wind. 6. How gloriously dreadful Heroes shine, Arm'd with Auxiliary Wine! The Spirits mantle, and a Martial Heat In the tumultuous Art'ries beat; The pushing Blood a War maintains, And sallies from the Heart, and charges thro' the Veins. 7. So when th' embattl'd Gyants strove To scale their Heav'n, and storm the Gods above, Thy Valour, Bacchus, high in Triumph rode; The Lyon's Wrath supported by a God, And thy own Grape, which taught thee to engage With a superior Force, and double Rage. Thus fortify'd, secure you chase Thro' Azure Plains the bold rebellious Race; Then drove the Monsters howling down, Confirming by their Fall, thy Father's doubtful Throne. The Artless Beauty. 1 Some may esteem those Beauties most Divine That dress'd in sparkling Di'monds shine; Whose precious Rays are proudly shown To give new Lustre, which conceal their own. 2 The Ropes of Pearl those meaner Beauties wear, Proclaim them rather Rich, than Fair; False Lights their tarnish'd Forms disguise, And Jewels glitter to reproach their Eyes. 3 Jewels like num'rous Stars set in the Sky, May form a spangl'd Galaxy, May gild the Clouds, and make them bright. But, when the Stars appear, we own 'tis Night. 4 Tho' on the Moor his Flames bright Phœbus throws, Yet swarthy Night deforms his Brows, Deep Shades his jetty Limbs o'rerun, Which Darkness wear, tho' Neighbours to the Sun. 5 You may approve the Nymphs, whose Faces wear A Flattering Resemblance of the Fair; The Pencil's mimick Beams admire, That strive to warm a Heart with Painted Fire. 6 And thus a dazling Vapour once cou'd move Ixion with fond Hopes of Love; The Youth a gilded Shadow woo'd, And for a Goddess clasp'd a figur'd Cloud. 7 Give me the artless blooming Maid, Whose Features need no foreign Aid, Whose Cheeks kind Nature's Hands adorn, With the same Blush that flecks the ruddy Morn. 8 On her fair Cheeks be no Vermilion spread, But that which flows in Native Red; Let blushing Modesty commend each Grace, And heighten all the Colours in her Face. 9 Give her no bright Attire, but let her Dress Owe all its Charms to Comeliness: Rich Drap'ry wrought by gaudy Art May take the Eye, but never reach the Heart. 10 Let her no Saphire wear, no precious Stone, But let her Beauty shine alone; Thus furnish'd out from her own Store, Not all the Indian World can give her more. 11 So Venus naked from the Ocean rose, Where Pearls are form'd, and Coral grows; With Coral deckt, or Pearls She wou'd not be, Herself the brightest Gem in all the Sea. The Swallow. ANACREONTICK. The Swallow does her Flight prepare, And takes her Progress with the Year: She basks here all the Summer long, Here builds her Nest, and breeds her Young. But when the weeping Heav'ns presage Th'approaching Season's stormy Rage, She with the Old Year wings her Way To Regions of unshaded Day; Then with the New returns again, And brings the Spring back in her Train. Ah! gentle Bird! to what Excess Shou'd I arrive of Happiness, Wou'd Love as reasonable be, And yearly come, and go like thee. But Love is my Eternal Guest, And builds for ever in my Breast. The Mother-Love, that brooding sits, A Thousand little Loves begets: Here some excluded Half we see, One Part imprison'd, one Part free; And struggling in the doubtful Strife, Peep thro' the Egg, just into Life; While others in Confinement dwell, Expecting it within the Shell: Where in Out-Lines is scarce descry'd The Form but rudely signify'd. One feather'd softly warbling sings, And Perching prunes its painted Wings: Some Chirping in the warm Nest lie, And make a num'rous Harmony; So that you'd take my Heart to be A little speaking Aviary. And when the wanton, callow Brood Greedily crave, and gape for Food, The Old one feeds 'em with my Blood; And some she feeds with Hopes, and Fears, And some with Sighs, and some with Tears: These growing up, supply their Place Still with a new, and younger Race. How many Loves have I in Store? Ten Thousand Loves at least, and more: So infinite is the Account, They to such endless Sums amount, Arithmetick can ne're express Them all; they are so numberless. Epistle to Sir R. E. You left Me ill, but, Sir, your Letter, Thanks to my Stars, has made Me better; For your Advice to Wight that is sick, Is more restorative than Physick: Which nicest Lady in the Land, Would take presented by your Hand. Fair Nymph would laugh till She bep??st Her, Would You vouchsafe to Administer, And so solace Her with a Clyster. For Nymphs are pleas'd much, I must tell ye, To take such warm Things in their Belly, And to put Proverb into Meeter, The deeper, Sir, You go, the sweeter, But, Good Sir Galen, if You please Let Us return to my own Case. You left my Pipe of Respiration Infested sore with Inflamation; And I who e'rst ne're thought Me happy, But when engag'd with You and Nappy, Now sicker grew each Day, and sicker, And fear'd but ev'n to dream of Liquor: Viana direful did appear, As Blood to touching Murderer. At Thought of Punch—I saw grim Demons That cannonaded Me with Lemons: And Brandy had with Spirits fell Set in one Blaze my Citadel, Had I not call'd to Mind just after, Th' auxiliary Supplies of Water. But ah! 'twou'd grieve thy Heart to think How I was damn'd to Posset-drink; Daily confin'd, by Orders cruel, To Penitential Water-gruel. And what wou'd make thy Heart more sorry, I had in Pole Vesicatory, Which made prodigious Tumors rise, Corroded by damn'd Spanish Flies. At length I found strange Alteration By Bleeding much, and much Purgation; Purgation which You know, Sir, eases In this, and other sore Diseases. A Wight yclep'd Pharmacopol, Levell'd his Bagpipe at my Hole; But oh! had You been there, and seen With what a jantee, airy Mien He let the squirting Engine fly, You wou'd have laugh'd,—so did not I. Sir Sydrophel ne're took such Care From Influence dire to purge a Star, When He full wistfully does grope, In Comet's Tail with Telescope. You're charitable, Sir, and nice, But I've no Guinea for Advice; Tho' the Receipts You mention hold Med'cines more valuable than Gold. You cannot think what woundy Slaughters You made, among our Towns-men's Daughters. One whisper'd loud, How wond'rous fine! Another, Mark his brawny Chine! Which does deserve, if well requited, More than Sir-Loyn did to be Knighted. And sooth to say, each Damsel pretty Loves Thee so well, that She cou'd eat Thee. Now Sir, I thank You for the Tok- en sent by gentle Sl?m of Noak: With which We drank your Health at Crown So long, till I forgot my own. But after All, to shew my Haviours, I greet You well for all your Favours; And I'll be, what I ever was, Your Friend, and Servant J. S. pos. TEARS. Say, Crystal Tears, that falling show Bright as the Eyes from whence You flow, Whose trickling Gems confer new Grace, And shed fresh Glories on her Face, Her Face that fair as Heav'n appears, Bath'd in the dewy Morning's Tears; Tell me from whence those Waters rise? How can they spring from Chloe's Eyes? Which kindling flush with hot Desire, And roll like Balls of living Fire: That all around their burning Arrows dart, And scatter Shafts unseen from ev'ry Part. False are my Eyes, my Thought too errs, For what I fancy'd Show'rs, and Tears, Is neither Tears, nor show'ry Rain; False are my Eyes, my Thoughts are vain. For All that from those Fountains stream, Are bubbling Drops of liquid Flame; No wonder then your scalding Tears are seen, Thus to consume, and torture Me within. What num'rous Torments Lovers bear! How small their Hope, how great their Fear! In freezing Flames the Wretches mourn, And then anon in Waters burn; For Love, that bears a Sov'raign Sway, Can make the Elements obey, Can change their Natures, and their Forces tame, Turn Fire to Water, Water into Flame. To His Grace the Duke of Beaufort, Upon His Happy Marriage TO THE Lady Mary Osborn. Connubio jungam stabili, propriamq; dicabo Omnes ut Tecum meritis pro talibus annos Exigat, &amp; pulchrâ faciat Te Prole Parentem. Virg. Æn. 1. Kind Venus, Queen of Gods above, Of Beauty Queen, and Queen of Love: And Thou her Son, whose wide Command Extends o're Air, or'e Sea, and Land, Whose Genial Fires thro' all Things move, And make the World ferment with Love: Assist, while I in Verse pursue Two more propitious Pow'rs than You. Thee, Hymen, next I will rehearse, Hymen, and Love shall crown my Verse. But Whom, my Lyre, dost thou design, With these Immortal Three to join? Maria well deserves thy Care, The Pride, and Envy of the Fair, She well deserves thy Tuneful Art, Whose Eyes subdu'd Great Beaufort's Heart. The Smiles of Heav'n on Beaufort wait, The Gods defend Maria's State; A Guard of Loves with Shafts and Bows Attend the Nymph wheree're she goes: But Shafts and Bows are useless found, The Fair without those Arms can wound: The Arrows so resistless fly, There's no retreating from Her Eye: So shoots the Lightning without Noise, And, tho 'tis sent from Heav'n, destroys. As Morning Beauty gently breaks In Purple Light upon Her Cheeks, Her Lord the dazling Form surveys With beating Heart, while mutual Sighs Alternately fan all their am'rous Joys. Beauty, with Charms, and ev'ry Grace, In Triumph smile upon Her Face, Eternal Youth around Her flies, And Pleasure dances in Her Eyes. The blushing Rose is justly held The Queen of Flow'rs that paint the Field; And thus, o're blooming Beauty's Train Maria's Charms assert Her Reign. Each budding Fair from Her receives Warm Influence, and expands Her Leaves: So Stars, those flaming Ministers of Night, Sparkle with menial Fires, and borrow'd Light. Bright Eye of Heav'n, who in thy annual Race Behold'st no Wonder like Maria's Face; Let Me, by thy returning Beams, behold Her Image cast in that sweet forming Mould; Thou to my Eyes wilt nobler Treasures show, Than all the Mines thy Flames create below. Prologue to the FOX: Spoken by Mr. WILKS TO THE University of Oxford. One Age produc'd Two mighty Bards, to show How far the utmost Pow'r of Wit cou'd go. Heav'n diff'rent Talents did to each impart, Shakespear more Wit, but Johnson shew'd more Art. Shakespear's diffusive Genius cou'd dispense, In gentle moving Sounds, the deepest Sense: But Nature wanted Skill,—and Johnson brought Horatian Laws to authorize his Thought. Ben's surly Lines are in Defiance writ, Sturdy the Phrase, and obstinate his Wit; His Plays the Form of Ancient Structures claim, Equal in Plan, and Rivals of their Fame; Which, by the Model of the Ancients cast, Shall like the Works of Greeks and Romans last. The various Humours which his Pen engage Are calculated right for ev'ry Age, We have La-fools, and fashionable Tonies, Corbacchio's, Mosca's, and our own Volpones. The Beaux our Fox's Way of Practice prove, They mount our Stage, and play vile Quacks in Love; And to their Mistresses in amorous Cases, Like him prescribe,—their own Cathartick Faces. In the Performance we present to-Night, Masterly drawn you'll see the Parasite; When the Gulls yawn, he subtly plays his Bait, All bribe, and all are Heirs to the Estate: So Burgess, where the Gold is freely giv'n, Cajoles the Saints, and packs 'em all to Heav'n. Your better Tastes such nauseous Shams refuse: You, like our Author, cultivate the Muse. What Joys (O Ben) thy Ghost receives to see These Ranks of thy Athenian Progeny, A Learned Race of younger Bens here sit, Th' adopted Sons of thy immortal Wit; Who, by the Dictates of thy Genius taught, Can best admire, what their Great Father wrote. Begging a Kiss. Bright Angel Form, impower'd above T' inspire the World below with Love, The whole Creation's Beauty lies Within the Circle of your Eyes; Upon your Lips all Perfumes grow, And od'rous Beds of Spices blow. Your Kisses, that in Nectar swim, With sparkling Joy dance o're the Brim, Like Wine, whose sprightly Atoms pass In nimble Leaps above the Glass: Then drink from those dear Lips of thine A Kiss, and pledge the Kiss from mine, That my unquiet Flames may rest, And rage no longer in my Breast. O drink not from your Lips divine A Kiss, nor pledge the Kiss from mine; For that has such a scorching Pow'r, It will inflame my Heart the more; But with each short Return of Breath Suck in my Soul, and give me Death; Till all exhal'd, no scatter'd Wind, Or wand'ring Atom's left behind. Yet ah! forbear with pow'rful Breath T' extract my Soul, and give me Death; For when I once my Soul have lost, I then shall be an airy Ghost, An empty Shadow gliding o're The Banks of Styx, or Lethe's Shore: Ah! too too sad unlovely Soil; Where Joy ne're dawns, no Pleasures smile; Where Love ne're warms, nor can we find A Mistress charm, or Beauty kind. Yet, Dearest, once more I request You'd suck my Soul out of my Breast, And as our eager Lips we join, I'll in soft Whispers call forth thine. Then, like that Alchymist the Bee, I to thy blooming Soul will flee, And, thence extracting Life, devour The Sweets of that immortal Flow'r. Our Souls thus lost, pale Shades we'll go To seek the Happy Dead below; Kind faithful Lovers long deceas'd, With Joys rewarded now, and bless'd; With them in Myrtle-Groves we'll stray, Dissolve the Hours in gentle Play, And bill, and kiss Eternity away. Here Lesbia, and Catullus prove The Sweets of Everlasting Love. Their faded Lips so wan appear, You'd swear Love's Ghost was wand'ring there; But in those Shades such Passions reign, So fierce a Rage they entertain, They kiss the God to Life again. And thus, my Fair One, we'll caress, And wanton in soft Happiness. Thus I all pale, and meager too, Will there embrace, and kiss thee so, The famous Chiefs for Love renown'd, With fragrant Myrtle Chaplets crown'd, Shall vanquish'd yield, and wond'ring see Themselves so much excell'd by Me, That they shall all my Conquests own, And with their Wreaths my Temples crown. Then shall your Slave with Pride submit To lay his Trophies at your Feet, While to your Eyes stern Pluto's Realms shall bow, And You shall reign a Queen of Love below. SONG. [When you, Clarinda, bless mine Eyes] 1 When you, Clarinda, bless mine Eyes, My swelling Heart with Joys o're fraught, Beneath the Pressure panting lies, And a short Death suspends my Thought: Till thus repriev'd awhile from Sense of Pain, 'Tis more than Life to view your Charms again. 2 Like Stars your Influence is found, And I by Darts unseen expire; Your Beauties at a Distance wound, And kindle in my Heart a Fire; A Fire more pure than from the Stars e're came, Bright as your Eyes, and lasting as their Flame. 3 And as Heav'n, when the Happy go T' inherit their Paternal Sky, Rewards short Death endur'd below, With Bliss, and Immortality: So You my present Suff'rings can remove, And give Eternal Life, Eternal Love. 4 Thus when Kind Venus saw her fair, Belov'd Adonis pale, and dead, She did the Youth at once prefer To Heav'n, and her immortal Bed; Between her Breasts he lies dissolv'd in Charms, And there for ever wantons in her Arms. To the Ladies. ANACREONTICK. Beneath this cool and fragrant Shade, With Myrtles, and with Roses made; While their od'rous Wreaths they spread, In Chaplets growing round my Head, While their mingling Sweets they join, Bring me, Fair Ones, bring me Wine: Wine that will inflame me more Than all your Beauties did before. See! it vig'rous Love supplies, See! the kindling Spirits rise, Dancing thro' my sparkling Eyes. Now all your Nobler Ointments pour, Now crown my Brows with ev'ry Flow'r. Flow'rs crown my Brows,—but ah! what Art Can cool the Burnings of my Heart! In vain they try to ease my Pain, Refreshing Garlands there are vain, And Wine will ineffectual prove, Wine that is Nourishment to Love. THE Eleventh ELEGY Of the Third BOOK of Ovid 's AMOURS imitated. Long have I born,—Perfidious Love depart; I'm tir'd with thy ill Usage of my Heart. Enlarg'd at last, I redden with Disdain, To think how long I've dragg'd the servile Chain. Thanks to my Stars, I'm Conqueror, tho' late, My boiling Passions sink, my Flames abate, And now I triumph in a safe Retreat. To part alas! I great Reluctance find; Yet I'll pursue the Purpose of my Mind, For tho' to lose the faithless Fair I mourn, My Griefs will after to Advantage turn. Thus bitter Med'cines often give us Ease, Remove the Pains, and baffle the Disease. And am I slighted thus—and have I born The killing Vengeance of your haughty Scorn? Have I your humble Slave been forc'd to wait, And whole Nights danc'd Attendance at your Gate, While to some Fool You gave up all your Charms, And hugg'd the senseless Coxcomb in your Arms? I saw him, when with Loss of Blood he reel'd, In Service spent, come stagg'ring from the Field: —'Twas I first made your private Beauty known, And recogniz'd it thro' th' admiring Town; My Songs invited all the World to gaze, Gave Lustre to your Eyes, and Glory to your Face. 'Tis needless to repeat your Jilting Lies, Deluding Falsehoods, frequent Perjuries, The secret Hints, lewd Glances,—the dumb Cant That pass'd between You, and your New Gallant; The speaking Nods, mute Dialogues You made, Which the loose Wishes of your Souls betray'd. I lately sent my Boy (fond doating Sot) To know if I might visit You, or not; Your Woman had her Cue,—“Says she, Pray tell “Your Master, Child, my Lady is not well. Wild with my Fears I ran, the Truth to see, I found You sick indeed—but 'twas of Me; My Rival soon knew how to sooth your Pain, One Healing Kiss recover'd You again. This and much more I've born—Get some dull Beast, A passive Beau, some Woman's Fool at least, Good Faith I can no longer brook the Jest. Over Love's Shrine my Vessel hangs at last, In Glad Remembrance of the Shipwrack past, And safely landed on the distant Shore, With Joy I hear the furious Billows roar; False Syren, all thy Wheedles now are vain, Thou ne're shalt tempt Me out to Sea again. Driv'n by two diff'rent Gusts of Love, and Hate, My Heart now floats to This Point, now to That; Both struggle in my Breast, but Love, I fear, All-pow'rful Love will prove the Conqueror. In vain, in vain, thy treach'rous Snares I shun, One Look, one Glance, and I'm again undone; A strange Aversion to your Crimes I find, But love your Body, tho' I hate your Mind. My giddy Soul turns round, and I perceive I can nor with thee, nor without thee live: Distracted with my wild Desires I rave, And I my self scarce know what I wou'd have. Th' unhandsome Things you've done, my Hatred move; But O! those Eyes perswade again to love: Your Eyes my strongest Resolutions break, So gently they perswade, such wond'rous Sense they speak: Upon my Soul insensibly they win, And melt me all to Tenderness within. By all those luscious, soft, endearing Charms We feasted on, in one another's Arms, By your sweet Face with Beauty's Blossoms strow'd, Your Face, to Me more pow'rful than a God; Remit my Sufferings, remove my Smart, Nor play the wanton Tyrant with my Heart. Your Eyes, your pow'rful Eyes have learn'd the Skill, And can, like Fate, necessitate my Will, My Will that leaves it to your Choice alone, Whether I freely Servitude shall own, Or wear my Fetters on Compulsion. Well, since 'tis thus, I'll spread the flying Sail Before the Wind, and catch the present Gale; Rowl'd down the Stream 'tis easier far to move, Since I, in Spite of mine own Heart, must Love. SONG. A Shepherdess To Her Lover Sleeping. I No longer, Gentle Youth, no longer sleep: Reveal the Beauties of those Eyes, Thy faithful Flock of mournful Sheep Neglect their needful Food until you rise; Unveil your Eyes which Ebon Brows adorn, These black as Night, those fairer than the Morn. II If Kisses might their dawning Light disclose, I there a Thousand wou'd bestow; But why shou'd I provoke my Lovely Foes That sleeping wake my Cares, and wound me too? Thus we poor Virgins by Experience find, The God of Love can kill, tho' he is blind. The FABLE OF The Fox and the Cock. As Reynard, mindful of his Prey, Was early jogging on the way, Wistfully casting up his Eyes, Sir Chanticleer at length he spies. Amidst his Hens he proudly sate, Exalted high on Perch of State. Large were his Spurs, and sharp his Bill, Jolly his Comb, full rosy was his Gill; Here he like Eastern Monarch shines, Among his Feather'd Concubines. The Fox in Courtly Phrase addrest, And thus in Form himself exprest. “I hope you've had a good Repose “With Madam Partlet, your fair Spouse. Then holding Eyes up, and Fore-feet, As saying Grace before his Meat; “Descend, quoth he, Friend Chanticleer, “Why what a Mischief makes you there? “Descend, for I have News to tell ye, “Will make your Heart leap in your Belly. “Why shou'd a Friend such Distance shew? “I, had I Wings, wou'd fly to you. The Cock look'd grave, but inly smiles, Appriz'd of Crafty Reynard's Wiles; And cry'd,—“I hope—you will excuse,— “But pray, this strange surprizing News. “I with my Family, and Wife “Here lead a lonesom, Country-Life, “And other News we seldom hear, “But paying Taxes every Year. “This Covert, and yon Yard afford “Provision both for Bed, and Board. “With Pains we spurn the Ground for Food, “And pick up a poor Livelihood. “Partlet perchance may sometimes go “To Market for a Mile, or two, “To sell some new-laid Eggs—or so; “But as for me—'tis seldom known “I visit what you call the Town. “We your Conveniencies want “Of Gazette, Post-Man, and Courant; “Permitted rarely to enquire “Into the State-Epistles of John Dyer. “But you Volpones oft resort “To that grand Mart of News, the Court, “And, as Prime Ministers, debate “The deep Intrigues of Church, and State; “Who, dextrously to shew your Skill, “Kingdoms unite against their Will, “And making a preposterous Pother, “One Nation sell—to buy another. “But this from ancient Pacquet-Mail; “Your fresher News,—for mine's grown stale. “Then know, both Kings of Beasts, and Birds “Have giv'n, nay ratify'd their Words, “And on th' important grand Occasion, “Have issu'd forth a Proclamation, “That all Hostilities shou'd cease, “And Birds, and Beasts both jointly keep the Peace. The Cock his Length of Neck stretch'd out, And wildly staring round about— Reynard appall'd—“What see you now, Sir? “Only our Northern Friend Sir Towzer. “Along he scours with wide voracious Jaws, “With Eyes that glow like Fire, and bloody Claws; “And at this Distance, if I not mistake, “Erects a Wood of Bristles on his Back. “Towzer—then 'tis high time for me to jog, “I hate that fawning, false, perfidious Dog. “You shall with me at least till Dinner stay. “Excuse—me—no—not—now—I fast to day. “Courage Monsieur,—nor meanly quit your Station, “We're all ensur'd, you know, by Proclamation. That's true; but—What?—Good Faith I mainly dread Towzer ne're heard the Proclamation read, And so his plaguy undiscerning Paws May seize my Corps,—and then farewel the Laws; All Law is weak, when Man Oppression feels; And so—my best Protection is—my Heels. Moral. This Fable shews, Statesmen may routed be, By Puzzling Schemes of their own Policy; May lay down Magisterial Laws and Rules Others to teach,—and make themselves the Fools. And, tho' from Court remov'd, sage Village-Cocks May ken as far—as our St. James's Fox; And when some Northern Lords are pleas'd to bully, The Fox himself may prove the greatest Cully. The LOAN. I Give me, my Fair, or lend at least Those Naughty, Rolling Eyes of thine, Whose sparkling Orbs, like Phœbus dress't With pointed Rays, severely shine: Your wanton Eyes that killing Arrows dart, And make another Quiver of my Heart. II But, Lovely Nymph, if you require On what Design the Loan I crave, I thence would back discharge the Fire, And Shafts that scorch, and wound your Slave; That You may be as wretched in your Turn, With equal Arrows bleed, with equal Fires may burn. To Mr. RUSSELL, Drawing Dr. SACHEVERELL's Picture soon after His TRYAL. What Admiration must This Piece command! A Form so Noble recommends Thy Hand. With no such Pomp the Planets glitt'ring lie Upon th' expanded Azure of the Sky; Like Heav'n are all Thy artful Figures made, Vary'd alternately with Light, and Shade. The Sun does no such Colouring display, When with his Beams he paints the purple Day. See at each Touch the Features starting rise, And new Life dawning sparkles from the Eyes. The glowing Heat that on the Front aspires, Equals his Flames, and rivals all his Fires. Bold was the Hand that durst attempt to draw Those more than Mortal Features, which cou'd awe Synods, and give to Lawless Senates Law. I saw Thee thrice essay,—the Pencil still Stood disobedient to the Master's Will, Eluded thrice His Art, and baffl'd thrice His Skill: His Pow'rs against their Artist now rebel, The Colours sunk, and faded as they fell. So Julius hearing greater Tully plead, No more, O Rome, wou'd own himself thy Head; Such mighty Rhetorick flash'd upon the Sense, The Nerves unstrung, His Papers fell from thence; The Thunder with superior Force was thrown, And as the Pleader's rose, the Hero dropt His own. The fam'd Palladium, which the Trojans boast Secur'd the City more than all their Host, And that Ancile, the Defence of Rome, Were Types of Him our better Shield to come: For future Ages well ordain'd by Fate, Nations to save, and raise a Sinking State: The Church and Priesthood on His Cause rely; So Atlas singly cou'd Support the Sky. Since Thou wilt paint Him, draw Him as He stood At the Tribunal, prodigal of Blood. In Innocence secure, divinely brave, Resolv'd to perish, or resolv'd to save: When His Accusers trembl'd so, and fear'd, That He the Judge, They Criminals appear'd. Let them, Salmoneus-like, around Him stand, With mimick Vengeance flaming in their Hand, Along the tinkling Arches vainly pass, And proudly rattle o're their Bridge of Brass; While, like a Jove, He from His lofty Brow Hurls real Thunder on His Foes below: Swift Lightnings darted from that bright Abode Disclose them Mortal, and confess the God. O! were Thy Picture Vocal, like my Song, And to the Features Thou could'st add His Tongue, From thence such wond'rous Eloquence wou'd break, The World wou'd silent wait to hear Him speak. The Language flowing from the Muses Spring Wou'd sweetly charm, as Syrens when they sing; The Figures all in Titian's Colours wrought, With pictur'd Words, and Imag'ry of Thought: So when the Sun with an inspiring Ray, Does upon Memnon's warbling Statue play, We hear soft-breathing Symphonies rebound, To Consorts rais'd, and kindl'd into Sound: His Image thus wou'd more divinely charm, Than Musick's God, and more than Phœbus warm. Two Portraitures the Ancients Wonder move, Apelles Venus, Phidias wrought a Jove: His Form will more than Grecian Skill demand, And where their Labours fail, Thy Work shall stand. ODE In Praise of BEAUTY. I. E're yet the Rowling Orb of Earth Was fashion'd, to receive its Birth, The Gods in awful Counsel sate; Long revolving, long They stay'd, Unresolving, long delay'd, In a fruitless, vain Debate, Till Jove at length saw Love appear, (What Pow'r has Heav'n when Love's not there?) He Love consulted, He obey'd, And so by Love the World was made. First CHORUS. Seraphick Joys the Heav'nly Host inspire; Then their Voices They raise In loud Accents of Praise, And join, and join in One Immortal Choir. II. The Thund'rer pleas'd their Song to hear, Shook with a Nod the Crystal Sphere; And as of Heav'ns Creating Pow'rs They sung, The Vaulted Skies with rattling Thunder rung, They rev'rence Jove, but Love applaud, And celebrate Him for the greater God. III. To see, th' Ethereal People flocking came, To see, and wonder at the Glorious Frame: A Thousand well-proportion'd Beauties rise From ev'ry sweet, harmonious Part, And all was manag'd with such Art, That with new Admiration rais'd They look'd,—again They look'd, and gaz'd, And fed their ravish'd Eyes. Second CHORUS. Now All transported, Beauty cry, Beauty, Beauty, Heav'nly Beauty, Beauty alone, Beauty alone is Harmony. IV. Thus Beauty o're the Globe was first display'd, By Love, and Beauty thus the World was made. But Jove in his Eternal Mind A far more noble Form design'd; He fram'd a lovely blooming Maid, In soft attracting Charms array'd, A Form ordain'd to rule the World He made: Himself did most the Workmanship approve, And nam'd the smiling Fair the beauteous Queen of Love. V. To Her He Pride, and Pity gave, This to Destroy, and That to Save; Soft Compassion, cold Disdain, To cause, and to redress the Lovers Pain: Coyness struggling with Desires, Words denying, Looks complying, Eyes that languish, Eyes that dying, Melt in their own tender Fires. Grand CHORUS. Now ev'ry Tuneful String prepare, Sound all the Instruments of War, To celebrate the Conquests of the Heavenly Fair. Her matchless Glories thro' the World disperse, And with Her Triumphs fill the Universe. A Persian Hymn to the Sun. I. Great Parent of Ethereal Lights, Celestial Fire, Immortal Flame, Be Thou propitious to our Rites, And hear while We invoke Thy Sacred Name. CHORUS. With Thine our Flames, and Incense rise, Our Vows pursue Thee to the Skies, And to Thee wing our Morning Sacrifice. II. Impregnate with Thy Genial Ray Earth's Womb, and bid it largely bent, With Blessings crown the springing Day, And savour with Thy Smiles, the tender Year. III. To Thy refining Fires We owe The shining Product of our Mould, Ripen'd by Thee our Metals grow, Our Mines are burnish'd into Gold. 'Tis from Thy Light our Jewels shine, The Wealth, and Beauties of the World are thine. Dialogue between a LOVER AND His MISTRESS. Lov.] I Love.—Yet scorn in Fetters bound Mist.] To drag my servile Chain. Who shun the Toils of being Crown'd, Refuse the Means to Reign. Lov.] II Lovers by Servitude are great, From Us all Pow'r You have. The King that does with Subjects treat, Becomes His Peoples Slave. Mist.] III A Monarch, ev'n in Love, is free; And claims unbounded Sway. But Kings, abusing Liberty, Make Subjects disobey. Lov.] Then let Us jointly thus embrace, Mist.] And revel in Delight: Lov.] So shall You reign all Day in Peace, And You in Love all Night. THE Oxford Expedition. A Late Expedition to Oxford was made By Protestant Peer, and his Brothers o'th' Blade, Who in Triumph from Gloc'ster his Lordship convey'd. Cho. Which no body can deny, deny; which no body can deny. II Had you seen all his Myrmidons when they came to 's, Equipt in their sturdy Grey Coats, and High Shoes, You'd have sworn not the Gaols, but all Hell was broke loose. Which no body, &amp;c. III In Rank, and in File there rode many a Man, Some in the Rear march'd, ay and some in the Van; And tho' some had no Hats, they'd Head-pieces on. Which no body, &amp;c.

When with brisk Wine I am inspir'd, And all my Veins are nobly fir'd, In the delicious Juice I steep, And lull my wakeful Cares asleep: My ruffling Sighs no more molest The Even Calmness of my Breast, No more their former Rage retain, Like Storms allay'd by Show'rs of Rain. While thus I drink, a secret Joy Does on my trembling Heart-Strings play; The well-tun'd Nerves in Parts agree, And I'm all over Harmony. My Voice, in Silence fetter'd long, Breaks unprovok'd into a Song, And gratefully breaths Hymns Divine, To praise the God that gave Us Wine. With Garlands Crown'd I drink, and sing More Happy than the Persian King. With glowing Leaves the Roses spread A starry Circle round my Head; Which with new blushing Glories shine, Enflam'd and purpl'd with our Wine. Let Desp'rate Wretches ply the Wars, For Honourable Wounds, and Scars; For Loss of Limbs Curs'd Gold receive, And barter Life it self, to live. The gentler Combats I pursue, Will Pleasure give, and Riches too. I feel, I burn with thirsty Rage, And grow impatient to engage. Fly, fly, my Boy, with Haste prepare Supplies to carry on the War; Draw out my Forces on this Plain, Present a Revelling Campaign. Charge all the Bowls and Glasses there, Now form the Van, Gross, Wings, and Rear; That Train of larger Vessels mount For loud Artill'ry, in the Front: See now I charge, and now give Fire: Those Ranks disorderly retire; I charge again, and now they fly, Sound, Io! sound the Victory. But hold—perfidious Death I see, As I press on, pursuing me; And while Without I Triumphs win, He undermines my Life Within. Fill, fill the Bowl, the very Sight Shall put that Phantom soon to Flight. Brave Wine sure Armour will bestow, And make me Proof against the Blow. Brisk Wine is sickly Nature's Stay, From Ruin frees, and from Decay: It, Chymist like, can Life restore, And from its Ashes raise the Flow'r; Wine sprightly Youth does still supply, And gives Us Immortality. The ROSES. I Go, lovely Pair of Roses, go, This clad in Scarlet, that in Snow. Go say to my Ungentle Fair, (If on your Forms She deigns to gaze) You dare not hope to Rival Her, Or match the Glories of Her Face; But that you're humbly sent, to prove A Youth undone by Beauty, and Her Love. II The sickly White in This pale Rose My Wan, and Meager Looks disclose: But That which shines so fiercely bright, Whose Head in painted Flames aspires, And blushes so with Purple Light, It seems to send forth real Fires, Tell Her, That Rose's ruddy Fires impart The Flames Her Eyes have kindled in my Heart. SONG. [How! Court Dorinda! Who the Devil] I How! Court Dorinda! Who the Devil Would ever prove so tame a Sot? If You are Kind, then She's Uncivil, When You would Love, then She will not. II To contradict is all Her Pleasure, Her utmost Virtue to Deny, Her Modesty (that boasted Treasure) Is—to give Her Self the Lye. III Then ne're, Mistaken Youth, stand Doating On Woman for Her Beauty's Sake, Nor for a silly Prize lie Plotting, Which She'll not give, but You may take. IV Summon out all the Pow'rs within Her, Then boldly push—She can't withstand; You'll find the surest Way to Win Her, Is to Engage with Sword in Hand. Epistle to a FRIEND. Dear Trusty Friend,— —when You read this, Don't think it came ab Inferis. For tho' (which You, no doubt, have read) There are Epistles from the Dead, Yet, take my Word, no modern Ghost E're once employ'd the Penny-Post; These scurvy Doggrel Rhimes were penn'd By Flesh, and Blood of Mortal Hand. 'Tis I alas! send this vile Letter, T' inform You in Unchristian Metre, That I (but what care You) am better. When last You saw Me at the Crown, Like old French Claret I drank down, Not all thy Whims cou'd make Me Jolly, Ev'n Wine increas'd my Melancholy: Such Storms of Sighs now heav'd my Breast, You swore, You thought, I was possess'd With Twenty Pair of Bellows at the least. Not Carted Bawd, or Dan. de Foe In Wooden Ruff e're bluster'd so; Nor Camisars of Gallick Nation, When they, brimful of Revelation, Discharge the Pot-guns of their Inspiration. So Quakers sigh, and grunt, and goggle, When Sister they in Spirit ogle, Oppress'd with Load they struggling bear it; I was depress'd for Want of Spirit. O! wou'd my Doctor, thought I then, Order me Honest William Pen, Or some Good Edifying Sister, Much Solace She might administer. But He, Confounded Learned Quack, Prescrib'd me a damn'd Oxford Hack. Says He, trot A Hack so call'd. Paper-Mill an Hour; 'Twill more relieve than Steel of Low'r, Succussate till You gall your Bum, There's Cubebs in't, and Cardamum. Our Hypocon—Ecclesiasticks Say the best Physick is Gymnasticks; And, if you'd gallop thro' a Course, Your ablest Doctor is—a Horse. This Point they learnedly discuss, And prove from fam'd Bucephalus, Who bore his Lord thro' Pikes, and Rapiers, And often cur'd him of the Vapours. But howsoe're the Learned smatter, I dare pronounce 'tis no such Matter. For Quixot, the fam'd Mancha Knight, Rode much, yet got but little by't. And trusty Rosinant, I'm sure, Was qualify'd as well to Cure; His sober Trot was full as good, To rectify, and churn the Blood. Did he not scour thro' Thick, and Thin, With Pate crack'd outward, and within? Imaginary Wars maintain Against the Wind-Mills of his Brain? That did by Whirling round, create Vertigo's in his crazy Pate; Vertigo's, which sage Sancho sent To Baratarian Government; And was not He when all was o're, As Great a Quixot as before? Ergo their Argumental Chat Is Spurious, and Sophisticate. Such Disputants as well may venture To clear the Nation's whole Debenture, And to Committees make appear What R???ge has cheated in Small-Beer; What Dilatory Gen'rals gain, How much they pocket each Campaign; Quit the Late Min'stry, and make out The J???to's Loyal, St????pe Stout; How many Millions sunk have been, Since our D??l??v????r came in; What Whigs are Plotting, and divine What Guiscard's Penknife did design; As work a Cure, or state the Case How Hypo—makes Mankind an Ass. But, weighty Arguments aside, Physicians tell me, I must ride. I therefore earnestly request You'd use Suburbian Interest, That when at London I arrive, I may ascend the Box, and drive: And in Requital, mounted there, I'll take Thee up—without a Fare. THE PRECAUTION. In Irregular STANZA'S. I Whither, my Heart, do You your Flight prepare? Make You a Visit to the Matchless Fair? Thither the Heedless Wanton flies, Ambitious to be ruin'd by Her Eyes: To meet their Shafts Impatient Lovers run, And proudly All contend to be undone. II Well—since You will be gone,—to Madness gaze On the Transcendent Glories of Her Face; Then trembling view each Colder Part, Her Snowy Bosom, and Her Icy Heart: Thro' all the various Regions move, And wander o're that Beauteous World of Love. III But O! I caution Thee, avoid with Care The flowing Tresses of Her Auborn Hair. The Braided Locks in which Fair Venus shone, When She the Vegetable Gold had won, Were form'd by no such Curious Art, Nor could She with such Charms surprize the Heart. IV The Curls in full Perfection shine, Form'd, like the World, by Hands Divine. Strings, like Her Hair, imperceptibly small Unite the Parts of this Enormous Ball: One Link dissolv'd, the starting Ruins fly, The Frame's disjointed, and the World must die. V Love in each winding Maze in Ambush lies, To make our wand'ring Hearts his Prize, All are with Artful Ruin set, Each Ring's a Gin, and every Curl's a Net. Then I advise Thee to beware, Fond Heart, I caution Thee avoid the Snare; Once fetter'd, all thy weak Attempts are vain, A Heart so lost will ne're return again. SONG. [How Great is the Monarch! how Pow'rful his Sway!] I How Great is the Monarch! how Pow'rful his Sway! When He nods, the Earth trembles, and Mankind obey. If his Frowns urge to Discord, no Friendship holds good, Weak Nature starts back, and recoils in the Blood; On his Brow sits Destruction, Fate waits on his Breath, By his Smiles his Slaves live, but his Anger is Death. CHORUS. All Empire belongs to Great Cæsar, and Jove; The King rules Below, and the God reigns Above. II If enrag'd by Affronts to rough Wars he incline, To revenge his Dishonour whole Nations combine; In Thunder He marches, the Globe He alarms, Thro' Mountains He breaks by the Force of his Arms; Our Blood paints his Triumphs; and Victors we bring All the Trophies of War, and present to our King. Cho. All Empire belongs, &amp;c. III Attended by Pleasures He sits on his Throne, And, when Slumbers invite, he reposes on Down. The Guards that around Him their Watch nightly keep, Are fatigu'd while He rests, kept awake by his Sleep: Fierce Armies with Fear his Displeasure behold, They are Slaves to his Passion, when brib'd by his Gold. CHORUS. All Empire belongs to Great Cæsar, and Jove; The King rules Below, and the God reigns Above. SONG. [Forbear, fond God, forbear your Dart] I Forbear, fond God, forbear your Dart, Seek not to wound a Dying Heart; At Chloe's Feet it gasping lies, A bleeding Victim to Her Conqu'ring Eyes. II From Her, Death's such a pleasing Pain, I wish to Live, to Dye again: With Joy to him the Blow is giv'n, That has so near a Prospect of his Heav'n. III You, and the little Loves all fly To light their Torches at Her Eye. By Her alone Love's Empires thrive, This Vestal keeps Love's Sacred Fire alive. IV Then, Chloe, 'tis not strange that You Weak Mortals yielding Hearts subdue, Since You another Venus prove, And give New Being to the God of Love. The FABLE OF THE DOCTOR, AND Patient with Sore Eyes. ? Ridentem dicere Verum Quid vetat? ? Lady Britannia, Rich of Yore, Was grown, of late, exceeding Poor, Who 'mong Her Neighbours in High Station With Credit liv'd, and Reputation. This Dame full many a Husband had, (So Chance directs) some good, some bad. 'Tis usual sometimes to miscarry, Where wanton Widows often marry: This Good Wife, e're She knew Trepanners, Had sundry Lordships, Farms, and Manors, Jewels, and Plate; and, without Toiling, Enough to keep the Pot a Boiling. To fetch Her Wealth, the Merchants run Their Annual Journey with the Sun: For Her to Distant Regions go, And sail as far as Winds can blow. The God of Day the Oar refines, Descends, and works in Indian Mines, Lab'ring ripe Metals to produce Both for her Ornament, and Use: But now t' Enrich the French We roam, And Trade Abroad, to Break at Home. A Spouse She had, who late controul'd Her Three Estates, grown weak, and old: Their Ancient Covenant displeases; He made the Tenants take New Leases. Some Boggling at his wild Demands, Threw up their Farms into his Hands; For settl'd now in full Possession, He us'd his Pow'r more, than Discretion, And gall'd the Peasants with Oppression. At this They call'd a Foreign Lord, Who Title try'd by Length of Sword, He brought a Red-Coat Posse Com, That bully'd him from House and Home, And threatning Ruin, War, and Battels, Righteously seiz'd his Goods and Chattels. The Warriour, mounted in the Saddle, Began to lay about and swaddle: The Old Incumbents were disgrac'd, Some cramb'd with Oaths, and some displac'd. Then Whigs were into Office thrust, And fawning Mungrels took their Post: From Him they held, but paid no Rents, The Lands their own, and Tenements; He was so Bountiful, their Crops Shot high above their Wanton Hopes; All ran in wild Pursuit of Gain, They saw 'twas to Divide, and Reign. This High and Mighty—Doughty Hero's Triumphs were sung by loud Bullero's: For He had, in Hibernian Wars, His Shoulder kiss'd by Bloody Mars. Long were the Broils, and Combats fought hard, Charging 'twixt Inward Man, and Outward; Till at the length his Spirits Force The Body routed, by—his Horse: So Diomedes Steeds, 'tis said, On Human Carcases were fed; And Bilboa Blade with Dew beslabber'd, Fretted with Rust, eats up the Scabbard. He hir'd th' Elements out for Pay, And let the Sun forth by the Day. His Vassals ne're presum'd to die, But they bequeath'd him Legacy. And, more to vex the Marriage-Life, The Husband fin'd to Kiss the Wife; Thinning the Unprolifick Nation By Gabels laid on Generation. Thus, by his Actions Meritorious, He has atchiev'd the Name of Glorious. Her last Good-Man in Flannel laid, She prudently call'd to her Aid A Matron train'd in Virtue's School; Who by Obedience learn'd to Rule. She was Sagacious, Wise, and Just, True to her Honour, and her Trust; So Gracious, so divinely Good, That She ennobl'd all her Blood. Discreet, and Unconceal'd by Art, And wears a Gen'rous English Heart: Born to make Civil Discord cease, And reconcile the World to Peace. By this Auspicious Dame defended, She found her Fortune quickly mended. But lately, as She pass'd the Strand, A Fellow popt into her Hand Quack-Bill of fam'd Ophthalmick Clark; She read,—and found her Eyes grow dark. So have I learn'd from Heathen Writ, That once a Hale and Able Cit Went in his perfect Health to Bed, Of Maurus dream'd, and was found dead. Darkling She went along the Street, And justl'd all She chanc'd to meet; Then groping onward by the Wall, She overturn'd a Huckster's Stall, And with it fell amidst the Ruins Of Fritters, Codlins, and stew'd Pruins: So after many Trips and Dodgings, With much ado She reach'd her Lodgings. Her Friends consulted, and agreed To send her Maid for Doctor Read. With her He roll'd in Coach, and Four That pranc'd, and neigh'd before the Door. Artfully having hemm'd a Space, He gravely enter'd on her Case. “Madam, (says he) Does there no Light “Araneæ dance before your Sight? “No Musca volans seem to fly, “Flutt'ring the Wing before your Eye? “But I, by closer View, observe “Ostruction in the Optick Nerve: “Which sore Disaster oft has brought all “Eyes so diseas'd t' Eclipses total. “But to proceed—and may it please ye, “Can You account how This might seize ye? “Sir, (She rejoin'd) This grevious Ill “Took Me perusing Quacking Bill. “Alas! such Cant, and senseless Jargon “Is hurtful to this Noble Organ. “I wonder much how You cou'd Read, “And keep your Eye-Balls in your Head. He then began his Emp'rick Wheedles, His Box produc'd, and Couching Needles: “Lady, (He cry'd) It is my Way “Of Practice, if No Cure, No Pay. So after Learned Exhortation, He fell to Use and Application. Thrice in a Day (nor did He miss it) The Punctual Doctor paid his Visit; Her hood-wink'd Lids He fillets o're, And made her Blinder than before; Daubing with Unguents, and such Tackle, The Casements of her Tabernacle: Amusing her with Terms of Science, To shew more masterly Conveyance. Early Sir Knight beat up her Quarters, E're She had buckl'd on her Garters. Tankard, with Tempting Liquor fraught, And more provoking Silver wrought, He took off—for his Morning-Draught. Doubling his Diligence, at Noon He din'd—on Porringer, and Spoon: And for his Ease, at Night's Approach, A Down-Bed flew with him in Coach. (For He concluded it was best, Tho' Madam cou'd not, He shou'd rest.) The painful Leach much Labour spent, The Doctor came,—her Substance went. His Patient ask'd—what Time o'Day; And straight He stole her Watch away. She bid him Sit—the Couch and Chairs Took silent Leave, and stole down Stairs. From Pedestals the Statues greet him, Pictures leapt from their Frames to meet him. The Arras Figures bush'd with Beard, His Awful Presence so rever'd, At Sight of Him they disappear'd. Obsequiously (without Attack) Th' Obedient Locks and Bolts flew back. Imprison'd Jewels, Rings and Lockets Made their Escape—into his Pockets. He fleec'd the Footmen, Grooms, and Pages, By Large Deductions from their Wages; Purloin'd the starving Servants Meat, And scarcely left them Bread to Eat. Some Moveables he claim'd of Right, The Rest by way of Perquisite: And, Midas-like, whate're he sees, He turn'd to Bribes, and Golden Fees. And now the Artist's Game was ended, And the Good Woman's Opticks mended. Who staring round with wild Amaze, Cry'd “There's Enchantment in this Place; “I once had Manteau's, Scarfs, and Hoods, “And other Valuable Goods, “Before this Sharper had undone me, “By Slurring thus the Doctor on me. At length Sir Phiz came Cringing to her; “Madam, (says he) I've wrought the Cure, “And, to my Deathless Reputation, “Have finish'd all—the Operation: “And here stand ready to be paid, “According to Agreement made. “Hold,—fair and softly, Good Sir Knight; “Convince me first I have my Sight. “To speak my Thoughts, I think my Case “Is ten times worse than e're it was, “For I see Nothing now; so prithee “'Tis your Deserts,—take That too with thee: “Yes—you have Doctor'd me—(Pox on ye) “I've found my Eyes,—but lost my Money. REFLEXIONS ON THE Foregoing FABLE. Long have We groan'd beneath Disasters, And Bondage of Ægyptian Masters, Who'd have our Tale of Bricks kept on, When all our Straw, and Fewel's gone. First State-Physicians (Sage and Able, As Operator in my Fable) By Lulling Opiats devise To doze the Brain, and close the Eyes. So Mountebank's Catholick Pill, Diseases propagates, which fill The Doctor's Fob, and Weekly Bill. The Nation now as blind as Beetle, Our Salesmen scorn'd to Trade by Retale; Who, like the Bucaneers of Greece, The Dragon charm'd, then stole the Fleece. They, plund'ring in outrageous Fashion, Quickly reduc'd the Beggar'd Nation T' an Oliverian Sequestration. Well, cry the Mob, “but now All's past, “And we have broke the Spell at last; “No more in Open Day we grope on, “God save the Queen,—our Eyes are open. Open indeed,—but 'tis to see Present, and Future Misery; Our Merchants broke, Home-Trades decrease, The Priesthood preaching against Peace, Hereditary Right disdain'd, The Church betray'd, Her Rites prophan'd, Her Doctrines publickly arraign'd. Some swallow Kingdoms, States devour, Batt'ning in Wealth, o'regorg'd with Pow'r; While Honest Britons that deserve Better than They, by Thousands, starve. So Wights, when by the Rickets curst, One Part's by partial Nature nurst, The others impotent, stand bent, Dwindling for want of Nourishment: Each Leg in Lunar Figure grows, Nerves stretch'd to Strings, Shanks warp'd to Bows; While Noddle which from Members stole, Swells to a Monstrous Jobbernoll. Thus are We Naked, Poor, and Bare As our first Eden-Parents were, Without a Fig-Leaf left to frame A Cov'ring, to conceal our Shame. TO A Gentleman slightly Wounded BY A Fair LADY. Cease (Damon) cease concern'd to be At Wounds, for which we envy Thee. For who wou'd not be treated so, Were that Fair Hand to give the Blow? Her Wounds I rather wou'd endure, Than from another Hand a Cure. From the XVIth ODE of the Second Book of Horace. Ocium Divos rogat &amp;c. Address'd to the Earl of ABINGDON. I. The Merchant, when his Vessel's toss't By Storms upon a Rocky Coast, Where furious Winds the mounting Billows ride, To Madness lashing on the foaming Tide; Whose flaggy Wings the Ocean sweep, And Battel join upon the boiling Deep: When he beholds a wat'ry War Of military Waves march rolling from afar, While the pale sickly Moon's expiring Light With humid Beams dissolve into the Night, And faithful Stars, by which he us'd to steer, Quench all their vital Flames, and die away with Fear: His Conscience starts from her Lethargick Sleep, Rouz'd by the loud Alarms upon the Deep: And as he now reflects on ev'ry Sin, As great a Tempest shakes his sinking Heart within. II. Now at one horrid View his Guilt presents His former Crimes, and future Punishments. In vain he does to Heav'n complain, And, prodigal of Vows, he importunes in vain; Thunders more loud the wrathful Pow'rs declare, And Heav'n displeas'd forbids the Gods to hear, Deafens his Cries, and intercepts his Pray'r. Not all the Freight his Vessels hold, Not all his Purple, Gems, and Gold, Can reconcile the Sea, or Wind, Or bribe the angry Gods, or buy a Peace of Mind. III. The Hardy German, Mercenary Swiss, (Tho' they by Arms and Publick Discord thrive, Tho' they on Blood and Rapine live) Address to Heav'n for such a Peace as this. The inward Terrors, sharp Remorse we find, Rage, Anguish, and wild Uproar of the Mind, Are louder, and more dreadful far Than all the bell'wing Engines of the War: By these our Cares are with us slain, By those we're rack'd anew, and kept alive for Pain. No Wealth, no Pomp, or Princely State, No swelling Titles of the haughty Great, Nor the High Blood that from Old Monarchs came, With which the Herald paints his Book of Fame, Can our tumultuous Thoughts controul, Or calm the ruffling Blasts that discompose the Soul. IV. Tho' Crowds of proud Attendants wait Around th' ambiguous Minister of State, (Officious to chastise the Throng That gaze upon the Pageant as he moves along) Yet his Retinues insufficient are To guard him from insulting Care. Care Grandeur does affect, and Kingly Port, And is Ambitious to be seen at Court: The Greatest Monarch is not free From her assiduous Importunity, She'll be deny'd on no Pretence, But will be introduc'd, and must have Audience. If to his Closet he repair, She dogs him thither, and torments him there; Licentiously bold, She dares obtrude On his obscure Retreat, and haunts his Solitude. V. Shou'd Earth's Capacious Globe, the Air, and Sea Be ransack'd to indulge his Luxury; Shou'd Florence, Bourdeaux, and the Rhine, In a Confederacy join, To send him Presents of the richest Wine; To them in vain he for Relief will call, They're nauseous, and insipid all. Let him his melting Hours employ In a refin'd Variety of Joy, And as the gay voluptuous Minutes fly, Let ev'ry soft harmonious Air Of Musick entertain the Ear, And blooming Beauty feast the ravish'd Eye; He'll find these Joys too impotent, and dull To charm the Hag that nightly rides his Soul; His Couches now no longer please, Down-Beds no more invite him to his Ease, On his distorted Brow Care ever wakeful lies, To brush the balmy Slumbers off, that hover o're his Eyes. VI. Thrice happy He! whom nor the Smiles of Fate, Nor Fortune with delusive Arts can cheat With any Thought so Mean, as that of being Great. Pleas'd with his small Hereditary Store, If he should ask, She cannot grant him more. His Table's plentifully spread From his own Granary that yields him Bread, A little Field, and Garden Fruits supply A wholesom clean Repast, And vertuously regale the Taste With Parsimonious Luxury. Amidst his Friends he quaffs with sweet Delight, And a plain hearty Meal can eat, Without his Services of Plate, Or Cyprian Wines to cure a sickly Appetite. No Dread of Midnight Thieves his Thoughts molest, Or interrupt his pleasing Rest; No Fear of Losing, or Desire of Gain Can discompose him, or distract his Brain; Peaceful, and undisturb'd, secure he lies From all the Bosom Throws of Sordid Avarice. VII. Riches the Target is, at which we dart From the well-furnish'd Quiver of the Heart: The Arrows fledg'd with wing'd Desires are sent, But to our Wishes disobedient, The Wanderers at random fly, And sweeping graze below, or flutt'ring mount too high; Wanting the Skill to guide 'em right, We rarely win the Prize, or hit the White. Why do we glitt'ring Piles of Treasure rear, The few Expences to defray, Upon th' Unhospitable Way Of Life's short Journey here? Or why to distant Countries roam, Hoping to leave our watchful Cares at Home? Shou'd we approach the Scythian Coast, Where Snows inhabit, and Eternal Frost, Thro' Frost, and Snows they will pursue, And cease not to torment wheree're we go. Besides our Native Soil our Hearts will charm, And like the Lamp that gilds the Skies, Or our Fair Mistress's brighter Eyes, Will at that Distance warm. Thither our Inclinations bend; Thither th' impatient Motions tend Of the Enamour'd Soul; And so the constant Needle points, and trembles to the Pole. VIII. We fly for Refuge to the Stormy Seas, For a Vicissitude of Ease; We fondly thus our selves deceive, In Noise and Discord Care delights to live. Tho' for the Indies we're design'd, And spread our Canvas to provoke the Wind; Yet Care, that on far swifter Pinions flies, Than Winds that chase the Clouds along the Skies, Will board the Vessel, tho' she find The Sides with Tyres of Cannon lin'd, Which from their brazen Wombs enlarge A Thousand fiery Births, a Thousand Deaths discharge. IX. Why do we search with a too Curious Eye Into th' Abyss of Dark Futurity? At airy Forms we strike, at Phantoms catch, And gay Appearances beyond our Reach. Dull Expectation is a hungry Treat, The Charity, and Alms of a penurious Fate. Let us with Gratitude receive The present Good kind Chance is pleas'd to give; Let no one Moment glide away, Without its double Share of Joy. Of what we now possess we are not sure, Since 'tis in fickle Fortune's Pow'r; And what may be remanded, if she frown, Improperly we call our own. A wise Man's his own Fortune, and will stand, Let her assault him upon either Hand; She can't with her insidious Art Attract his Eyes, or tempt his guarded Heart. Let her before his Feet pour down Wealth, Glory, Beauty, Honour, and Renown, Thro' Greatness of his Soul he can despise The shining Pomp, and tinsel'd Braveries, Unmov'd he can the gilded Trash survey, And when she courts him—turn his Face away. But if Indiff'rency, and Scorn Into Revenge her Favours turn, He singly dares her num'rous Troops engage, And by his Conduct soon disarms her Rage, Well fortify'd within, he does no Danger dread, Tho' all the Burst of War was thund'ring round his Head. X. The World no Fav'rite e're caress'd That we cou'd call entirely bless'd. That Prince, who high on his exalted Throne In full Meridian of his Glory shone, By Fortune's Treachery at last Had all his Grandeur, all his Pomp laid waste; She her Arrears of Malice paid, While by an Insolence scarce known, The Trayt'ress boldly seiz'd his Throne, And tore the Sacred Honours from his Hoary Head. Deluded thus by Court-Deceit, And gilded Pageantry of State, To make him doubly Wretched, first She made him Great. Had He not been by Priests betray'd, To faithless Rome a Victim made, Oppress'd with Age H' had not been sent In Tears to mourn a Second Banishment. But Gods decreed his Fall, and who can be Sufficient to withstand what Gods decree? And thus He bow'd beneath the Doom, Thus bow'd, thus fell He to ungrateful Rome, And more ungrateful Patriots at Home: Betray'd, abandon'd, left forlorn, The Peoples Idol once, now made their Scorn; Deserted by false Friends his Bounty fed, Who plunder'd him, of what He gave them, Bread; Stripp'd of his Wealth and Pow'r, the Nerves that bring Strength to a Crown, and Safety to a King. So sunk the Atlas of our State Beneath the Pressure of Three Kingdoms Weight; The too unruly Sceptre foil'd his Hand, Nor cou'd He fill the Circle of his wide Command. XI. Sated with Life thus some survive to see, And to protract, their Misery; Others, untimely snatch'd away, Fade in the Bud, or in the Flow'r decay. Death, that beholds us prodigally waste, Calls in the Principle in Haste, Impatient long to wait a desp'rate Sum, Th' uncertain Interest of Bankrupt Years to come. When the young Hero from afar, With glowing Eyes beholds th' embattl'd War, The jointed Armour, portray'd Shield, And waving Banners of the Crested Field; His fev'rish Heart begins to beat With an impatient Bridegroom's Heat, And now transported with the fierce Delight, He claims the Battel, and demands the Fight; But if the Trumpet's Sound he hear, His Limbs all shiver, and prepare To mount the fi'ry Steed, and shake the glitt'ring Spear. Warmly he pushes on the Game, Resolv'd to win immortal Fame, And in the bold Advent'rous Play, At one Chance throws the Jewel Life away; Extended on the Earth, his Grave, Now lies the Valiant, Youthful, and the Brave: His Soul soars upward to the Blest Abode, Falling a Mortal here, and rising there a God. XII. The crowding Years, which Fools so vainly prize, Avoid the Great, as Riches shun the Wise. But your distinguish'd Worth, and wond'rous Sense, Have reconcil'd the Laws of Providence. YOU, Sir, are bless'd with ample Store, Nor do You Ask, but to Distribute more, Which You as gen'rously Bestow, As Gracious Heav'n conferr'd the Gift on You. As Jove to Danae of old, You glitter down in sparkling Show'rs of Gold; The Torrent flows with such a swift Increase, That You surprize Us into Happiness. Amidst a Plentiful Estate, You from your Old Hereditary Seat, In the cool Bosom of the Vale below, See your fat Oxen feed, and hear 'em low, And as the woolly Flocks bleat o're the Plain, The Hills around low back, and Echo bleats again. XIII. You no Diversions ask but what the Field, And Rural Sports with Innocence may yield; Shunning the Gaudy Pomp, and State Of guilty Pleasures that attend the Great. Life lengthens with the Chase; which You repair By drawing wholsom Draughts of Vital Air. Like Spring your Looks; fresh, fair, and young, Which gives us Hopes we shall enjoy You long: Thus You th' united Force of Maladies withstand, By Lenitives prescrib'd by kindly Nature's Hand. XIV. The nimble-footed Fallow Deer, The wily Fox, and tim'rous Hare, Or runs the wand'ring Maze, or lightly bounds Before the chearful Consort of your well-breath'd Hounds; And as the op'ning Beagles shake the Grove, Echo repeats the Cry, and hunts above. Fowls of a rank, or feeble Wing, That springing rise for Game, or sit and sing, The bright-plum'd Pheasant with indented Crest, And Em'ralds set in Gold profusely dress'd; Swift-gliding Shoals that row with finny Oars, And nimbly scud along the Shores, That arm'd with Silver Scales disportive run, Twinkling with nimble Glance against the Mid-day Sun: All Creatures that or go, or swim, or fly, That graze the Mead, or Pastures of the Sky, Upon your God-like Bounty feed; Breathe for your Pleasure, at your Pleasure bleed: They all your Vassals are, for your Delight renew, From You they Hold, Lease out their Lives to You. XV. The Royal Stag, Lord of the Sylvan Chase, Monarch of all the Wood-land Race, With humble Pride submits, declining low The graceful Terrors of his shady Brow; Whose branching Honours, high aspiring, spread Like some tall Oak upon a Mountain's Head. Th' obedient Herd in Expectation stands, Ambitiously contending, and demands The flying Wound directed by your Hands: The Pious Victim to Advantage dies, That falls to Heav'n, and You, a willing Sacrifice. XVI. Now let the Gen'rous Courser breath a-while; No more, my Lord, pursue your pleasing Toil; Forsake the Woods, and humble Plain, And listen to a more exalted Strain. Under the Conduct of the Muse I dare Attempt the Hero, and his Toils in War, To Kings, and their Victorious Arms aspire, And to the Trumpet raise the tuneful Lyre. Now my aspiring Soul presumes to try Her daring Pinions, and invades the Sky: When lo! I'm upward shot By Extasy, and Energy of Thought, And, sailing on the Clouds, descry Thunders that in the Womb yet forming lie; While others ripe for Birth, too closely pent, Murmuring roll, and struggle for a Vent; Till the unruly, monstrous Birth at length, Must'ring up all its Terror, Rage, and Strength, Tears thro' the yawning Cloud a furious Way; And forcibly enlarg'd explodes aloud for Joy. Then from a dreadful Precipice's Height, With an undaunted, steady Sight, A mighty Void I trace Of the Imaginary Space; And ever as I mount, and upward go, With Scorn look down, with Scorn behold, th' ill-natur'd World below. An EPITAPH ON THE Divine Mr. BUTLER, THE Incomparable Author of Hudibras. Here Phœnix BUTLER lies, whose precious Mold Wou'd suffer in the Change, tho' turn'd to Gold. His Chymick Dust to Jewels shall give Birth, Refine gross Matter, and sublime the Earth; Himself Himself survives, nor can he die, Consign'd by Fame to Immortality. Who travels o're his Book, will there descry Treasures, that all the World's too poor to buy: Phœbus his Sire with greater Lustre shines In his One Work, than All his Indian Mines. He flies his daring Muse, and in her Way Sour Hypocrites, and Rebels are her Prey, Saints are expos'd with Masquerading Face; Much Beard, small Wit, and plenteous Want of Grace. His pointed Satire like a Shaft is found, Whose Feathers tickle, while the Steel does wound: With Indignation fir'd he sneering writes; The gen'rous Mastiff thus both grins, and bites. He (our bright Sun) his shining Progress made (Hid by no Cloud, and darken'd by no Shade) Within our out-stretch'd Island's wide Embrace; The Tropicks of his wide Poetick Race. England Triumph, and pour forth mournful Dews, The Sepulchre, and Cradle of his Muse; No Kingdom but Great Britain cou'd contain His mighty Ruins, or improve his Vein. O Albion! I might well thy Conduct blame, That Thou no Costly Monument of Fame Hast Consecrated to his Deathless Name, But that no Fun'ral Pomp can equal be, To Recognize a Bard so Great as He. Since no Corinthian Brass, no Porph'ry Stone, No Verse can Eternize Him, like his own; Strictly to do Him Honour, let Him have His sweet Poetick Flow'rs strow'd o're his Grave. Thus reconcil'd, his Expiated Ghost Shall glory in a Tomb of greater Cost, Than the whole Kingly Race of Ptolomies can boast. Upon a FLOWER IN A LADY's Bosom. O Flow'r above all others blest! Shalt thou insensible then rest, On those white Pillows of her downy Breast? In that warm Bed her Bosom lie New purpl'd, and full blown with Joy? Her Bosom that all Sweets does bear That blush in Flow'rs to paint the Year. Thrice Happy Flow'r, how blest thy State! O might I once enjoy thy Fate! Between the Sister-Paps to dwell, And rove, and wanton there my Fill; Between those little Globes be laid, Twin-Globes, where Heav'n, and Earth's display'd; Admitted there Love's Joyful Guest, I wou'd not doze in thoughtless Rest, But o're the Silver Field wou'd stray, And restless wander ev'ry Way. Her small round Breasts, and Neck embrace, And Kisses leave in ev'ry Place; On this white Ball of melting Snow I first a Thousand wou'd bestow, And as I kiss'd increase my Store, By giving That a Thousand more. Nor think this all—for I shou'd grow So very Curious, to know What Diff'rence lay between the Two: And judge with quick discerning Eyes How this did swell, how that did rise; If that or this more white appear'd, Or this than that more plump or hard: Whether the Left round Globe, or Right Did panting heave with more Delight, Or with a brighter Orb allur'd the Sight. If Right or Left inviting Sphere Did in the painted Center bear A sweeter Bud, or blowing spread A liveli'r Blush, or deeper Red. Now wou'd I, wing'd with am'rous Speed, See where those winding Vallies lead, Which op'ning with Luxurious Pride, Those Lovely Hills, her Breasts divide; Along the Flow'ry Dales I'd go, To feast on blooming Joys below: Where, like the Bees, fledg'd Cupids bring The plunder'd Treasures of the Spring, And form Ambrosial Cells, that hold Hyblæan Drops of Liquid Gold. I on that Milky Way wou'd move, Silent as Planets glide above, Till I had reach'd the Awful Throne of Love; Where Gods the Cyprian Queen adore, And kneel t' exalt the Goddess more. Ah Sweet Ingrate! ah Cruel Fair! How hard my Fate, and how severe! If her coy Bosom I approach, It trembling seems to fly the Touch, Then shrinking back forbids the Bliss, And shuns the bare Suspicion of a Kiss. And can She then refuse to grant A Gift so small to Me that want; So very small a Grace deny To Me that know to prize the Joy? Who so great Freedoms does allow, Who so great Favours does bestow, On Flow'rs that neither ask, nor know; Which nor desire, nor yet can be Appriz'd of their Felicity. Invocation to the Lobster: Somewhat more Solemn than the Rest of the POEM. Patron of Numbers which Rare Poets use, Thy Self unstrung, tune Thou my Doggrel Muse; Within whose hollow Arch soft Warblings dwell, Harmonious Madrigals, that far excel Those of the winged Minstrels vocal Shell: Frequent in Feet no more my Metre shun, And tho' Thou crawl'st, O teach my Verse to run: To my blith Rhimes thy num'rous Succours bring, And of thy Self instruct thy Bard to Sing. A RHAPSODY UPON A LOBSTER. POEM Burlesque. Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam Jungere sic velit, &amp; varias inducere plumas Undiq; collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum Desinat in piscem ? Hor. de Art. Poet. Antique Philosophers maintain Nature acts not (like them) in vain; But We will prove 'tis no such Matter, Whate're they say, I say Negatur. If Horace (in whate're you call it) His Prosphonetick Ode, or Ballad, Sagely asserts, as Quid probabile, That the Sea is Dissociabile,— And thence infers, it is forbidden, That Billows shou'd by Boats be ridden; Or Mortals foreign Market keep, Leaving the Land, to plow the Deep; Then Procul dubio 'tis plain, Nature acts frustrà, or in vain. For Disobedient Wights we find, That box the Compass, and the Wind; For Pelf to Distant Climates run Of Rising, and of Setting Sun; Unrighteous Slaves, who make no more Of Crossing Seas from Shore to Shore Than Scullers, when they Voyage fetch From Temple-Stairs to Chelsea-Reach; And plund'ring Neptune on their way, As We his Fish, They gut the Sea. The Warriour Sword-Fish, and the Whale, With Rapier arm'd, and Shield-broad Scale, Cannot with various Kind of Arms Secure themselves from mortal Harms; Nor can ev'n Shell-fish 'scape the Gin, With Bones without, and Flesh within. Not Lobsters, tho' they crusted are In jointed Armour de la Guer, With all their Legs (while Man's pursuing) Can save their Carcases from Ruin. Full oft alas! I've seen their Quarters Fasten'd to Stake, like Smithfield Martyrs; And after many cruel Turnings, Expos'd to Faggot, Fire, and Burnings, Melodiously resign their Breath, And, Swan-like, sing themselves to Death. Thus have I Rabble seen, intent At Minstrel's uncouth Merriment, Where as one Hand's swift Fingers fly, The other spits the Harmony, And turning 'em still one by one, The Tunes all roast, till all are done. Sea-faring Uncle of blind Archer, Must grow as mad as any March-Hare, That Man shou'd wreck his Churlish Nature On's Scaly Citizens o'th' Water; That He shou'd Murd'rous Laws invent For Friday-Treats, and order Lent; A Persecuting Popish Plot To make his Subjects go to Pot! Not all their Suff'rings once afforded In Fox his Rolls to be recorded, But deem'd unworthy of the Grace, Among his Worthies to have Place! If we believe what Poets tell, Ladies and Nymphs in Ocean dwell, And sure to Tars a goodly Sight 'tis Nereids to see, and Amphitrites; Nereids that sport with Triton Spouses, And spawn Seed-Pearl in Scollop-Houses: Lobstero thus (as often seen) Keeps Lady, that keeps State within; She, like the wanton Cyprian Dame, Provokes the Gentle Lover's Flame, And makes our amorous John Dorys As far as Paris ride for Chloris; Salacious 'Squires of Churning Dream, Blowz-Dairy-Maids, and Clouted Cream. Aloft She sits on Throne as fair, As Cassio—in Celestial Chair, —Peia by t' other Half-Name Height, And shrin'd in Crystal, shines as bright; Or Dames that ride o're Streams to Cool, Exalted high in Cucking-Stool, When they their Hen-peck'd Husbands wrong, By loud Incontinence of Tongue, And giv'n too shrilly to dispute, Like other Fish, it makes 'em Mute This Lady's Hospitable Seat Is much frequented in Fish street; Fair are the Nymphs that wait upon her, The Fish-Wives are her Maids of Honour, Who, as along they Warbling go, Cry Fish above, and Sell below: These Mermaids as Enchanting be, And Singing charm like those at Sea; Their Melody such Danger bears, Ulysses-like, we stop our Ears, Lest their Harmonious Airs, and Breath At once should Sing, and Stink to Death. 'Tis said Cameleons make Repast On Viands of Ethereal Blast; And what seems stranger yet, we read Of Creatures that by Flames are fed, Which like bold Slaves Ensurers hire, Or Chymist's Lungs, subsist by Fire, (Tho' different Ways they bring't about, The one puts in, the other out). Thus have I seen at wond'rous Shew, In famous Fair Hight Barthol'mew, A Wight, that had been Satan's Prentice, Grave Cits, his Fellow-Servants entice, And swallow Flames, and Fire as quick As his own Pædagogue Old Nick: The Rabble stare to see him eat His Chafin-Dish instead of Meat, And grind more Charcoal than a Score Green-Sickness Damsels can devour; Or Madam Porcia, to go further, First She-Professor of the Order. And now, tho' wond'rous strange, I'll shew, Lobsters by Fire are nourish'd too: But if you say 'tis a wrong Notion, Because no Flames are in the Ocean, To your Objection thus I answer, Lobster's o' Kin to Sign call'd Cancer; And as He's of Celestial Line, So, like his Birth, his Food's Divine: For as the Moon her Orb does swell, So that increases in the Shell: Tis thus like Spiritual Jugglers seen, All dark without, the Light's within; But tho' they boast of Inward Light, We all well know how they Come by't; Since frantick Fits discover soon, That they're enlighten'd by the Moon. Now that within Nocturnal Shell Pale Visionary Glimm'rings dwell, By Demonstration I'll evince, And Testimony of the Sense; For when the Heav'ns (black Night returning) For Day departed put on Mourning, From tainted Limbs to wond'ring Eyes Thousands of heatless Sparks arise: Not half so scalding as the Brand That burn'd bold Mutius in the Hand: These Sparks are Reliques, and no more Than Beams imprison'd there before, In Durance kept, and close Custody, Till interwoven in the Body. Kind Vestals thus that ply in Street, Which City-G'ographers call Fleet, With inward Flames in secret glow, Preserv'd sub Lunæ Concavo. And lo! as if it knew 'twas hateful To be for Boons receiv'd ungrateful, The Lusty Food helps Female Neighbours, Promotes their Husband's, and their Labours; And in return much Work supplies For that Bright Midwife of the Skies. Lobster with Cavear in fit Places, Gives won'drous Help in barren Cases; It warms the chiller Veins, and proves A kind Incentive to our Loves; It is a Philter, and High Diet, That lets no Lady sleep in Quiet: 'Twill Vig'rous Youth to Age restore, And get us Twins, when turn'd Fourscore. Nay, thy Example does support Our Modern Politicks at Court; V??lp?ne, and his puzling Notions Ap'd thee in thy prepost'rous Motions, Who by Designs perverse, and awkard, Made our Affairs, like thee, crawl backward: Some Gen'rals thus in One Campaign, Fight all their Conquests back again. A Modern Geographer, perhaps, May of the Sea invent New Maps, Peopl'd with Fish as various, and In Forms as strange, as those on Land; And his odd Project to advance, Christens his Lobsters, Africans, Or dubs 'em by his Learned Notion The Moors, and Negroes of the Ocean. Now, as on Land, there is no Creature But is express'd by Fish in Water; So Crabs, and Lobsters stil'd may be The Bums, and Catchpoles of the Sea: For if there be, as sure there is, The Thing call'd Metempsychosis, The Souls of Bums departed dwell Within the Hollow of their Shell; Hence, Warranted by Nature's Laws, They carry Grinders in their Claws, And treach'rously Arrest, and Catch Whatever comes within their Reach. If we'll trust Catholick Recorders, There was a Lobster once in Orders; And ever since upon his Back Canonically he wears Black, Tho' not to Cassock form'd or Gown, Like tatter'd Crape that strolls the Town; This Truth in Legend will appear Of Missionary Saint Xavier. Once Windy Boreas in a Frolick Let fly, and gave the Sea the Cholick; Neptune sore grip'd, cry'd, Gods! it is hard What Grumblings feel I in my Gizzard! His Crucifix the good Apostle Let down to cure Intestine Bustle; It well the Wonder did perform, But sinking vanish'd with the Storm; Much disappointed at the Loss Of Holy Talisman his Cross, He to retrieve it first applies To Heav'n his lifted Hands and Eyes, Then rattles many a Magick Bead, Which guides to Bliss by Clue of Thread, And thrice three times an Ave said; Seeing mean time a Lobster crawl He laid on Hands Episcopal, And so Ordain'd him—not to preach, But to hold forth his Claws, and fetch; Tho' driv'n by Winds that bluster'd high, That faster crawl'd than Ship could fly; Lobstero thus, which in Quandary, The Saint had taught to fetch and carry, Prov'd like th' Apostle, Emissary. And as it is in Story plain, Brought him his Crucifix again. But O! ye Learn'd brimful of Knowledge, Ye Nat'ralists of Gresham-College, Expound to me, if you are able, How Lobster, that alive is Sable, When in his Liquor, puts on Red, And throws his Mourning off, when Dead: Among You all there is not One Can solve me this Phænomenon: But I, who sip no Learned Coffee, And rarely muse on Philosophy, Ill-vers'd in Pliny's Nat'ral Hist'ry, Will soon unriddle this Dark Myst'ry: If Ferguson turns Renegade, Leaves Kirk, and quits the Canting Trade, Righteously changing Sword Eternal, The Spirit'al, for Tilter Carnal; Deserts the Sober Weed of Scholars, And runs (true Turncoat) from his Colours; While Scarlet, lists the Errant Saint, Dragoon of the Church Militant; Why may not Black-Coats of the Water, Tho' Creatures of inferior Nature, Observe the self-same Holy Rules, And turn their Sables into Gules? Since Man was sure created best, To give Example to the rest: Besides the Godly sure must grant, 'Tis good to imitate a Saint: The Saints who, to support the Cause, Trim with Divine and Human Laws, They are God's Children, so too weak Th' Almighty's Ord'nances to break; And when they see a Civil Storm, They can Occas'onally Conform; Thus while there is a Fellow-feeling 'Twixt Party-Lawyers, and false Spelling, Indictments will have Gaps, and Flaws For them to Mesh through, and the Laws. As Brethren of Militia-Sword By Exercising keep the Word, And fortify'd in County-Buff, Are Basket-Hilt, and Cudgel Proof; Yet, in Obedience to Command, Turn, and Return to Either Hand: So Presbyters that still have on A Buff-coat Conscience of their own, Perversly move contrary quite, And turn—but never to the Right. They are of the Spread-Eagle Kind, With Face before, and Face behind, On Popish Church-Lands Gospel-Spies, That, like the Beast, are full of Eyes, And whirl 'em round which way you list, They still look tow'rd their Interest: And as a Dog, that plies the Wheel, Turns oft, and treads the same Place still; So which way e're the World goes round, They with it move,—and keep their Ground. And now, altho' there were no more said, We may perceive by the aforesaid, How Juggling Non-Cons change their Coats, Leave Mangling Texts for Cutting Throats; The Word is weak, but Sword is strong, And Pow'r was never in the wrong: Th' Evangelists with Them have no Spell, But trusty Pike, and Gun are Gospel. The CONFESSION. For why, my Friend, shou'd I conceal A Flame that must itself reveal? That Matchless Dame, whose Sov'raign Pow'r The Brightest Nymphs with Pride adore, That Goddess's Victorious Eyes Have made your Thyrsis Heart her Prize: Her Eyes, whose Lustre soon can charm The Proudest Heart, the Coldest warm. 'Twas now the Boy first taught me Cares, Unpractis'd yet in Cupid's Wars, Where by Pursuit fresh Wounds we gain, And all the Conquest's to be slain. When first I saw this Lovely Maid I then was ruin'd, then betray'd; Her polish'd Beauties shine so bright, And thence reflect such dazling Light, With aking Sight I on them gaze, And my Eyes darken on her Face. High on her spacious Front above, Heav'n opens wide—a Heav'n of Love. Her Eye-brows black beneath it lie, Like Two bent Bows of Ebony. Her ruddy Lips are big with Joy, And her soft Smiles create the Boy. Upon her Cheeks fresh Roses blow, Which, as her Virgin-Blushes flow, Flash in the Blood, and crimson all their Snow. Her Neck, whose Pillar does sustain That Intellectual World her Brain, In artful Workmanship transcends The Pow'r of any Mortal Hands; That Atlas, whose loud Fame's so great For bearing Heav'n, wou'd change his State, Proud to sustain this Nobler Weight. These Beauties then, these Charms Divine Have vanquish'd this poor Heart of mine, From which it never can remove, Linkt fast by Chains of endless Love. The OLD MAN. Yes—I am Old, I must confess, Yet I ne're drink one Drop the less; A larger Glass—I fain wou'd see The hardy Youth dares answer me; The Puny Stripling soon shall know, As I the Boy in Years outgo, I shall in Manly Drinking too. The Circling Hours I measure out By Bowls of Wine dispatch'd about, And as the nimble Atoms pass, I take for ev'ry Sand a Glass. Wheree're my Chearful Friends are found, The Goblet, like the Sun, walks round; The Sun, whose rip'ning Beams but shine To give us fresh Supplies of Wine. Let's frolick then, and be profuse, And to our Genius give a Loose: Bacchus had never reach'd the Sky By Dulness, and Sobriety, He Nobler Ways to Glory trod, And drank himself into a God. Yes—I am Old, and on that Score 'Tis fit that I carouse the more; Six in a Hand—the Cold's so great My Blood is scarcely heated yet; The kindly Warmth by Drinking bred Will melt the Snow upon my Head, 'Twill thaw the Ice that chills each Vein, And make the Old Man young again. For either Hand, my Friends, produce A Bottle charg'd with sprightly Juice; I will not ask a better Prop To keep my stagg'ring Figure up. When my last Fatal Minute's come, Thus wou'd I reel into my Tomb, There quite dead drunk resign my Breath, And so prevent the Stroke of Death. The Burning LOVER. Cease, Tyrant Love, thy Rage give o're; It is enough—I suffer more Than ever wretched Lover felt before. A kindling Fire enflames my Veins, Which thro' the Blood, and Marrow reigns. And must my Sighs—must they conspire To blow the Brand, and fan the Fire? At length, fond Boy, these Fires asswage, At length, ye Sighs, suppress your Rage, Bid all your former Fury cease, And sink to breathing Calms of Peace. Sufficiently the burning Smart Already has consum'd my Heart, And tyranniz'd thro' ev'ry Part. Then since no Safety thus appears, Begon, ye Flames;—approach, ye Tears; With cooling Streams the Fires appease, And give a wretched Lover Ease: Approach, ye Tears; and weep a Flood, To quench the Fervour in my Blood. But how can Tears my Fires appease, Or give a wretched Lover Ease? How can my Eyes supply a Flood To quench the Fervour of my Blood? Since thirsty Flames, which Tears devour, Have drank up ev'ry cooling Show'r. Thus from my Eyes I no Relief can claim, Condemn'd to Burn, and Live amidst the Flame. An ELEGY To His Friend, who advis'd Him to desist from LOVE. In vain, Sir, You advise me to depart From Love, that has already seiz'd my Heart; I cannot this Unruly Passion tame, Suppress the Fury, or conceal my Flame; Alas! 'tis hard a Remedy to find, Or sooth this restless Calenture of Mind. Can I, my Friend, can I stand by, and see Panthea's Charms with Dull Indiff'rency? Her Yellow Tresses unconcern'd behold, That grace her iv'ry Neck with burnish'd Gold? While her round swelling Breasts in Whiteness rise, And with Resistless Fires She rolls her wanton Eyes? Can I see this, ye Gods, and yet forbear Heaping impatient Kisses on the Fair? Kisses! that on her Lips shall leave display'd Th' am'rous Signs, my ardent Transports made? Perish the cautious Wretch,—who thus can rule His fierce Desires;—ah! perish the dull Fool, Curse on the Sot, who so discreet can prove, Thus to command his Passion, and his Love: Let Her be guarded with Officious Spies, Her Mother's Fears, and Husband's Jealousies; To Cens'ring Coxcombs let my Love be known, And whisper'd round by ev'ry Fool in Town, Till Murmurs, and the common Breath of Fame Loudly divulge, and spread abroad my Flame: I the vain Murmurs of those Fools despise, With her stern Lord's quick-sighted Jealousies, And the old Mother's ever watchful Eyes. I wou'd my Love shou'd court the publick Ear Of noisy Fops, that crowd each Theatre; Let 'em grudge me Success, while they despair. Thus the first Lovers did their Joys dispense In happy Freedom, tender Innocence; In gentle Pairs the blooming Nymphs, and Swains Met and caress'd upon the flow'ry Plains; In soft Discourse, gay Sports, and artless Play They entertain'd the Hours, prolong'd the Day; A Thousand tender Things they look'd, and said, And whisp'ring Sighs their yielding Hearts betray'd: Their naked Beauties charm'd the ravish'd Sight, Till Love provok'd each other to Delight: Exchanging Lips, their panting Breasts they join'd, The Youths were constant, and the Virgins kind. Let Others seem reserv'd, Disguises try, And mask their Love in mean Hypocrisy; Our good Old Fathers Frankness I approve, And by their Standard regulate my Love: Is it a Fault, or has it ever been To pay Obedience to the Cyprian Queen? If so, nor Heav'n, nor Gods themselves can be Absolv'd from Censures and Impiety. Fair Ariadne's Eyes so bright did shine, They doubly cou'd enrage the God of Wine; Beauty the God of Day with Love inspires, And with new Force augments his former Fires. For Love Great Jove a Thousand Forms put on, Forms that were all more pow'rful than his own, The am'rous Lowings of a Bull cou'd do More than his Godhead, and his Thunder too; Europa made him leave his Bright Abode, And to be Happy, he depos'd the God. Then, Dearest, let us live, and close pursue The Pleasures Love, and Beauty prompt us to; Th' Examples follow that the Gods have giv'n, Nor think that Sin, which is approv'd by Heav'n. If 'tis a Sin, 'tis such as I wou'd chuse, For Her I, like the Gods, wou'd Heav'n refuse: Nay, I shou'd think it as a Judgment sent, If for so sweet a Crime I shou'd relent, Or ever be so graceless to repent. SONG in a MASQUE. First MOVEMENT. What Pangs we endure, and what Torments we prove, When first we're enslav'd by the Passion of Love: The Soul is with Fury possest, All the Blood is on Fire, While we flame with Desire, And we carry our Hell in our Breast. Second MOVEMENT. Thro' all the Universe it rules, And makes the whole Creation Fools: An Epidemick Plague 'tis grown; Love singly contains All Tortures, and Pains, Love, Love is all Torments in One. Third MOVEMENT. To the Wheel of Ixion poor Lovers are bound, And are ever, for ever, for ever turn'd round: They in a giddy Circle move, And still in Pursuit, still are snatch'd from their Love. Fourth MOVEMENT. Beauty deludes, and we assist the Cheat: It is a Vis'onary Treat That tempts us with a thousand Charms; But when we think to clasp the Joy, The treach'rous Phantom slips away, And leaves us to repent with empty Arms. CHORUS. Yet, Love, thou bear'st such Charms about thee, Nor Men, nor Gods can live without thee, Tho' wounded, we seek for no Cure; But proud of our Chains, W' enjoy all the Pains, And our Pleasure's the greater, the more we endure. The WEDDING-RING, OR, An Infallible Remedy against Cuckoldom. A Ballad. I Rouze Cuckolds elect, both Ye Old, and Ye Young; Be attentive, and prick up your Ears to my Song, Which Words of Solace shall impart To ease the Brow, and chear the Heart. CHORUS. Then all wedded Mortals in Town, or in City, Pray listen a-while, and give Ear to my Ditty. II Says the Proverb, Who takes a foul Gypsie to Wife, Does Penance for ever, yet Sins all his Life. They all will jilt You, but a Beauty Will most infallibly Cornute Ye; And He that's entail'd to a Punk that is fair, Shall ne're want good Plenty of Horns, and much Care. Cho. Then all wedded Mortals, &amp;c. III An Artist there was, and he took much Delight The Devil to paint, and still painted him white. Old Nick, to shew himself a civil, Well-bred, obliging, grateful Devil, Appear'd in a Dream, to bestow some Boon on him, For all the good Service the Painter had done him. Then all wedded Mortals, &amp;c. IV Quoth Belzebub then, since You paint Me still white all, Let's know of Thee how I may make a Requital. Now this same Mortal had, I'm told, A Damsel blithe of Heav'nly Mold: Wou'd your Devilship grant, he reply'd, that my Luck hold, And that I may ne're be a Sniv'ling Cuckold. Then all wedded Mortals, &amp;c. V 'Tis granted, quoth he, and without more Delay He seem'd on his Finger a Ring to convey; Whilst This Thou wear'st, Thou canst not be A Cuckold, Friend, take that from Me; But if the said Ring be not constantly worn, Man, nor Devil can't keep Thee from wearing the Horn Then all wedded Mortals, &amp;c. VI This done, little Belzebub nimbly departed; The Painter as nimbly from Pillow up started; And Circl'd found his Finger soon In Concave of his Wife's Half-Moon; Quoth he, to ensure Us of Spouse, when We marry We always such Rings on our Fingers must carry. Then all wedded Mortals, &amp;c. An EPILOGUE FOR Mr. PENKETHMAN TO THE University of Oxford. Th' Assizes now are past;—yet here You sit Apollo's Joint-Commissioners of Wit. But I have Hopes, Kind Judges, no Offence, You will a favourable Doom dispense To One, that's rarely guilty found—of Sense. I, this Numerical, Individual Ipse, Had once my Fortune told me by a Gypsie, Her Hand I cross'd, and thus She did harangue me: “Fear not, Dear Rogue, thy Wit shall never hang thee; “Thou 'lt be averse to Academick Breeding, “Nor shalt thou take a Vi'lent Death by Reading. Well—if condemn'd by You,—if such my Case is, I ask the Ladies Favour, and good Graces;— Will You see poor Will. Penkethman make Faces? Now Sirs,—if I, to weather out the Storm, Like t' other House, Occasionally Conform, There is a great Inducement for Complying, For I've a main Propensity towards Lying. In Times of Yore, You know, Sirs, on Occasion, There has been such a Thing as Sequestration; A damn'd hard Word—that beggar'd Half the Nation. Words often bear a strange Mysterious Sense, They can conform You out of all your Pence, Occas'onally produce most wond'rous Matters, Cuckold the Cit, and lie with all his Daughters; Can make Will. Penkethman a Boanerges, And Preach, and Pray—like any Daniel Burgess. Now 'twou'd be strange, if our devout Trepanners Shou'd send me hither to Reform your Manners: Zealously mounted in that Holy Station, I'd swinge the Sisters thro'—the Reformation. And troth, your Gentle Filly's here, I find Are true right Courteous Damsels, well inclin'd To be, upon a good Occasion, kind. Each Night before the Door they never fail To stand like publick Goods expos'd to Sale; By You to be perus'd the Nymphs are sent, Drest elegantly They appear in Print, And if You cannot read,—the Devil's in't. But They're cheap Ware for ev'ry saunt'ring Fop, And the most tumbl'd Goods in all their Father's Shop. 'Twas Reformation once that play'd the Game, And modern Cant may now effect the same. Shou'd Zeal of Moderation-Saints aspire, Inflame the Nation, and the Blaze grow higher, How moderately wou'd they put out the Fire! Their Martial Rage and Discipline will warm ye, Protected thus no Violence can harm ye; All know the Moderation of a Low-Church Army. Thus pious Noll cou'd whine, and preach the Word, Guns were his Doctrine, and his Text the Sword. Rank and File Arguments have plaguy Force, Maintain'd by Regiments of Foot, and Horse; And no Religion can be in the Wrong, When once it marches Forty Thousand strong. What blooming Virtues in these Walls appear! Our Guard ordain'd by Heav'n's peculiar Care; In London—bless us! what lewd Rakes are there! They are for Roaring, Wenching, Scouring, Drinking; For Contemplation You, and sober Thinking: Our Bullies there make Damning a Vocation, Whiggs plot to damn You too,—but, on Occasion, Here are Good Men enough to save a Nation. So when the Rains above were downwards sent, To join the Floods beneath the Firmament, The pious Few were well preserv'd by Grace, To stock us with a more obedient Race; The fairest Model by the Gods design'd To form the World a-new, and fashion all Mankind. Imitated from the 12th Elegy of the Second Book of Propertius. Gods! what a Night was that when rapt I lay In all the furious Transports of my Joy! And O my Bed! how happy didst thou prove, Shook with Convulsions of Tumultuous Love: And as the Taper's pale Fires trembling play'd, Heav'ns! how we kiss'd! what tender Things we said! But what soft Combats, what a wanton Fight Began, when kindly that withdrew its Light! Now, with her swelling panting Breasts all bare, She faintly struggles to maintain the War: Fir'd with a Touch, soft Flames dissolve each Part, And glide thro' all the Veins into my Heart. Then, as I slept, fatigu'd with am'rous Play, She murm'ring Charm'd the drowsy God away. “And can'st thou now (quoth She) a Truant prove? “False to my Passion! Traytor to my Love! How variously our Clasping Arms now twine! And in what Wreaths our Curling Bodies join! My Soul then hov'ring o're her Lips of Bliss, I seal a Long—an Everlasting Kiss. While Youth and Beauty jointly here conspire To give at once, and favour our Desire, Let pleasing Objects ev'ry Sense surprize, And Draughts of Love o'recharge our drunken Eyes; First Age, then Death's Eternal Night comes on, The Objects vanish, and our Joys are gone. O may we thus unite, cemented fast As long as Life, and Love it self will last! Outrageous Love admits no Term, or Bound, But runs the Circle of an endless Round; On Billows of fierce Pleasures wou'd be toss't, Wander in Bliss, and be for ever lost. Sooner the Sun shall his old Road forsake, And Rivers to their Fountains Head run back; The Earth shall cease her Vital Fruits to bear, And disallow the Promise of the Year; Fish sooner leave the Floods, the Floods the Sea, Than I, Dear Cynthia, will depart from thee. Let's not consume the Time in Jars and Strife, But freely taste the transient Joys of Life: Bless me but with a Kiss, I more receive Than all the Boundless Wealth the World can give. As sickly Flow'rs their tarnish'd Colours shed Into our Wine from Chaplets round our Head, Our Wine that grows with Standing pall'd and dead; So, like the Flow'rs, and sparkling Wine, awhile Our Youth does in the Bloom of Beauty smile, Then fades:—and tho' our flatt'ring Joys seem great, Yet with To-morrow's Sun they all may set. TO A Young LADY Singing, AND Playing upon Her Spinet. [I.] Kind Philomel, that glad'st the chearful Spring, From flow'ry Tempe's vocal Shades repair, And in a various Consort with Thee bring The sweetest wing'd Musicians of the Air; To Mirabel distinguish'd Homage pay, To Mirabella Queen of artful Song, Whose melting Strains can steal the Soul away, Call Age from Death, with Raptures Kill the Young. First CHORUS. Let Mirabel extend your swelling Throats, Learn from her Airs to form unusual Notes; And when You all your utmost Skill have shown, She will o'repay your Songs with Nobler of her own. II. Less pow'rful Strains the Thracian Bard Employ'd beneath the dancing Shade, When on his warbling Lute he play'd, Ambitious to instruct th' Inferior Herd. When You, my Charmer, touch the Lyre, You teach not Brutes, but Mankind to admire; And were We not transported when You play, Mankind must prove more senseless Brutes than they. III. When to her Instruments enchanting Sound The matchless Mirabella Sings; When nimbly o're the pratling Strings Her flying Fingers bound; Should now the God of Musick hear, The God of Musick would desert his Sphere; Nor need he, leaving Heav'n, repine, Might he but tune his Voice by thine; No more would He for Daphne burn, No more the flying Fair pursue, The Nymph no more into a Lawrel turn, But to a Mortal change Himself for You. Last CHORUS. Sing, Sing ye Muses, celebrate the Fair, Th' Harmonious are still the Muses Care. O! wou'd the God that dwells upon her Tongue, With equal Sounds inspire my Song, Ah! then what Joys! what ravishing Delights, To hear her sing, what thus the Poet writes! SONG. [Woman's an Obsequious Creature] I Woman's an Obsequious Creature, Fashion'd to comply by Nature; Her Virtue's hum'rously inclin'd, Now fondly peevish, now perversly kind. II Strong in Desire, in Honour weak, She's brittle Ware, and soon will break; The coyest Danae has no Pow'r, When young Jove storms Her in a Golden Show'r. The Disputing Pedant. AN Extempore Whim in a Tavern. An Ass, as modern Wits aver, Does appropinque Philosopher: And full as Sage that Plodder looks, Whene're he dozes o're his Books; Yawning he nods in such wise Fashion, Till Sleep confirms his Contemplation. A Man, as Learned Authors say, May read, and think his Wits away; By Labour, thus it comes to pass, Man may attain to be an Ass. Thoughts oft Debauch, when Wine will not; Your thinking Fool's the greatest Sot: Whoever reads o're Scotus once, Will straight become another Duns. Then give me Wine, let Tom. Aquinas, And all Philosophers—kiss mine A?. The MISTRESS: OR, The Force of BEAUTY. I Wheree're the Lovely Charmer's seen, Sweet winning Graces round Her wait, Attending on Her, as their Queen, And with their Train compose her State: Her pleasing Airs the Passions gently move, Infusing Spirits of Resistless Love. II She Incense breathes; and am'rous Fires Break forth unseen from ev'ry Part, Which dart around her gay Desires Into the Eyes, and melt the Heart; The ravish'd Eyes transported with Delight, For ever wish to keep Her in their Sight. III The Indian lab'ring in the Mine, When He his Mistress does behold, No longer thinks the Jewels shine, He Gazes—and Neglects the Gold; His worthless Gems no more employ his Care, He leaves the Treasure, and pursues the Fair. IV Should now a Lyon cross his Way, He durst the furious Beast engage; The Lyon must become his Prey, Love arms him with a stronger Rage: Secure of Victory, he can despise All Force but that—of Imoïnda's Eyes. On the Same. I Behold the Fair! See where She smiling lies, While Pleasures dance, and revel in her Eyes! The youthful Monarch wou'd resign His Court's Luxurious Pride, In softer Pleasures here to reign, And wed so fair a Bride. II Let the stern Hero once but view Those sweet prevailing Charms, He will no more in Wars pursue The Fortune of his Arms; He here will prize one Conquest more, Than all his Triumphs gain'd before. III Grave Sages impotent, and cold, At Sight of Her, forget they're old, Their Learned Arts despise; In Favour of the Fair agree, Leave vain Disputes, and cease to be Impertinently Wise. The VISIT. 'Twas Noon; and seeking a Retreat From scorching Phœbus burning Heat, I to my brighter Mistress came, To wanton in a Nobler Flame: When lo! the glaring Lightnings fly In nimble Fires along the Sky, And with those Fires loud Thunder went, That Pealing shook the Firmament! Pale with her Fear, with Fear half dead, Trembling into my Arms She fled; I press'd Her close, o'rejoy'd to find That Fear had render'd Her more kind. Now as I clasp'd Her in my Arms, Possess'd of all her Heav'n of Charms, Said I, ah! too too tim'rous Maid, In vain You fly to me for Aid; For if I Safety cou'd impart, I had from You secur'd my Heart. Why do You tremble thus to hear Thunder, as vain, as is your Fear? Or from a Lambent Flame retire, That burns with ineffectual Fire? Jove, that has lov'd, will Beauty spare; His Thunder cannot hurt the Fair. Ah! then bright Goddess, do You save, Rather do You preserve your Slave; Your faithful Slave that bleeding lies, Undone by your Victorious Eyes: From whence destructive Lightnings stream, That burn me with a fiercer Flame. The MARK. ANACREONTICK. The Gen'rous Courser bears with Pride His Master's Mark upon his Side; The Letters there inscrib'd by Flame Illustrate, with the Brand, his Name. We the Warlike Parthians know By their Quiver, and their Bow; The Silken Persians confess Their wanton Nation by their Dress; And Lovers thus themselves declare By the imprinted Wounds they wear. Whereever You these Signs discover Be sure the wretched Youth's a Lover: His Fair One's Name by Cupid's Dart Is burnt into his bleeding Heart; You there behold the Shaft struck deep, And hear Him groan, and see Him weep. The MISTAKE. The Queen of Love in wanton Pride Was Sporting by a River's Side; The Brook, as She along did pass, Into a Mirror smooth'd its Face; The softly-gliding Current stay'd, Pleas'd to reflect so sweet a Shade. In Haste each am'rous River-god To see Her rose above the Flood, Then diving, in the Cooling Streams With Wonder felt unusual Flames. The Graces, that around Her wait, All wept, as conscious of her Fate: Each dewy Flow'r let fall a Tear, And Winds in Sighs salute her Ear. Cupid with eager Joy beheld The Goddess, as She rang'd the Field, Then at his Mother wing'd the Dart, And by Mistake he pierc'd her Heart. Into her Heart the Arrow fled, The Goddess sigh'd,—She wept,—She bled; The Arrow with the Blood was stain'd, And as She bled, She thus complain'd. Alas! says She, my little Son, Ah! heedless Boy—what hast thou done! That Thou shou'dst impiously design To take Her Life, who gave Thee thine! To Her surpriz'd He ran with Speed, He saw Her weep,—He saw Her bleed; Fixt in her Breast the Shaft he found, He saw, and felt himself the Wound: His Quiver, Bow, and Darts he broke, And almost drown'd in Tears thus spoke. Unhappy Boy! Mischievous Bow! That I shou'd wound my Mother so! But by these flowing Tears I swear, And by the trickling Wound You bear, The Arrow that I erring sent, To Chloe's Cruel Heart was meant. The Beauties of that Lovely Maid Have your unwary Son betray'd; She moves with such Heav'nly Grace, And such sweet Smiles play o're her Face, The matchless Virgin charms like You, The brightest Form that shines below: Nay Heav'n itself, when You're not there, Can shew me Nothing Half so fair. Ah Love! I pity thy hard Fate, Since I'm alike Unfortunate: I mourn the Error of thy Bow, Fair Venus Wrongs affect me too; Wou'd Chloe's scornful Heart had bled In thy much injur'd Mother's Stead, Perhaps when once She felt the Smart, She'd pity my poor bleeding Heart. A DIALOGUE Between a Satyr and a Young Nymph. Sat.] Stay, Fairest, stay; I have pursu'd Thee long; Nymph.] Cease your Wooing, And Pursuing, Thou'rt too frightful, I too young: And I alas! and I alas! too young. Sat.] Those Bubbies now to bud begin, With Pleasure how they pant, and rise! Young Love flutt'ring lies within, And see 'tis kindling in your Eyes! Cou'd your Heart with mine agree, I fear by To Morrow, You'd prove to my Sorrow, Young as you are, an Over-Match for me: O then, my Dear, be you as willing, Nymph.] As you are fit.— Sat.] As you are ripe.— Nym.] As you are fit.— Sat.] As you are ripe for Billing. Nymph.] Those shaggy Limbs, and Beard must needs invite A tender Nymph to taste Delight; Satyr, forbear,—tempt not my Scorning; Thou'rt a Cuckold in Love, I know by thy Horning. Sat.] Were I your Spouse these Brows wou'd bear A larger Crop than now they wear, Most Husbands are Cuckolds.— Nym.] Then Husbands are Creatures Like Thee, very Beasts, very Beasts by their Natures. Sat.] Come to my Cave, and I have there A little Bird to give my Dear. Nym.] A little Bird!—if 'tis so small, You may e'en keep't for Good and all. Ah! no, no, ne're think your Bird here to bring in, My Cage was not made for your Wood-lark to sing in. The Heart Sent. I Make Haste, my Heart, fly to that peerless Dame, For whom I burn in an unusual Flame; Tell Her what num'rous Racks I bear, What Wounds from Grief, what Wounds from Care; But ah! my Heart, that thou to Her must run To seek Relief, by whom thou art undone. II Say how with Show'rs of Tears my Eyes still flow, Which nourish Grief, and but augment my Woe. How Time, and Life for Her I waste, My Time, and Life that fly too fast; Tell Her, these Wrongs I patiently endure, Only in Hopes from Her to find a Cure. III But tho' in Tears I'm drown'd, in Flames I burn, And tho' amidst a Thousand Cares I mourn, Yet if the Nymph's so gently kind, As once to have Me in her Mind, Tell Her—O! tell Her then, that I possess But too much Joy, but too much Happiness. The DREAM. When gentle Sleep had charm'd my Breast, And lull'd my Senses all to Rest; With my deluded Eyes I seem'd To view Anacreon, whilst I dream'd: A Garland on his Head He wore, And in his Hand his Lyre He bore: Harmonious Sounds around Him broke, In melting Strains, whene're He spoke; And, as He touch'd the dancing Strings, The Loves that waited, clapt their Wings. Old He appear'd; but Silver Hair, That show'd Him old, had made Him fair: His Beauties like the Roses shine, His Smiles were Chearful as his Wine. A Cupid led the Reeling Bard, At once his Conduct, and his Guard. His Wreath He took, his Wreath that spread Fresh blooming Glories round his Head, And with a Smile, said He, receive The Noblest Present I can give. With Joy I bow'd, my Homage paid, Proud of the Present which He made. The fragrant Flow'rs breath'd Sweets divine, They smelt of Him, and He, of Wine. Then unadvis'd, with heedless Haste The Chaplet on my Brows I plac'd. The Chaplet, warm'd with gay Desires, Breath'd gentle Flames, and am'rous Fires, Now in my Blood Anacreon reigns, Love and Anacreon fill my Veins: To his soft Lyre my Passions move, His Lyre, that tunes my Heart to Love. An EPISTLE. Friend,— —We receiv'd your sad Epistle, In which we understand you piss ill. And it must be a doleful Matter, Amidst much Fire to have no Water, Or scalding Liquor dribbling out, Like Drops from slow Alembick's Snout, Which fall in liquid Burnings down, As erst on Sodom's burning Town. We're told the flaming Judgment there Was for Attacking in the Rear; An Action cowardly and base! But here th' Attack was Face to Face Thy Weapon, than which nought was braver, Is bound, we hear, to good Behaviour; A mean unsoldier-like Disaster, That ne're did yet attend his Master. And troth it is a foul Disgrace; Reduc'd to Circumstances base Of trading Damsel's Needle-Case. Nay, it a Lamentable Case is, That you're prescrib'd damn'd Close-stool Faces, Merry as those raw Sinners make, When first they Pill, or Bolus take: Or straining Juggler's, when he strives To quilt down Forks, or swallow Knives. A dismal Sight it wou'd have been, To see poor Talboy Penance do for Sin, With Flannel Muffler underneath his Chin. Your running Nag must surely ride ill, Painfully rein'd by shorten'd Bridle. So mettl'd Colts that toss and rear, Are rode in Martingale severe, Till they become as tame, and quiet, As your's is now, restrain'd from Diet, Tho' under Favour, Friend, I think Your Nag has Store of Diet-Drink. In your Epistolary Summons Issu'd to Member of the Commons, By Impulse of Poetick Rapture (I shall not say what Verse or Chapter) You write, You suffer Tribulation, And that you're Clapt to save the Nation You are so Gen'rous on this Score, I know you wish 'twas ten times more; For O! what Fame, what wond'rous Merit! When You heroically bear it. And Glorious 'tis, when You alone Make a whole Nation's Curse your own! Thus Curtius, the young Roman brave, By Suff'ring did an Empire save: The pious Youth, with like Design, Leap'd in a Gulph, tho' not of Brine, Nor half so hot, or deep as thine. Alcides so, great Son of Jove, Fell a Proud Sacrifice to Love, And kindl'd up by Virtuous Bride, Was most severely deify'd. Thus, mighty Hero, You at last, After twice Six such Labours past, Like that OEtean Hercules, shall be Enroll'd a Second Codpiece-Deity. TO Mr. R. C. and His LADY, ON THE Birth of Their First Child; Born in the SPRING. Tu modo nascenti Puero, quo ferrea primùm Desinet, ac toto surget Gens aurea mundo, Casta fave Lucina; Tuus jam regnat Apollo. Virg. Ecl. 4. I. The Mother's and Lucina's Labours past, The Pledge of mutual Love's disclos'd at last; The Birth that in the Womb obscurely lay In pregnant Darkness, and prolifick Night, Now vig'rously breaks into Day, And struggling darts into the Light. Smile then, Auspicious Infant, smile Upon Thy Mother, to reward Her Toil; One chearful Look, one gleaming Ray Will chase the flying Clouds of Grief away, Will well atone for what She did sustain, Her nauseous Qualms, her Throws, and all her Nine Months Pain. II. See now the Priests devout! and lo! They all in long Procession go, To solemnize the publick Show. Each Oratory, and each Shrine, With more than Earthly Honours shine, In Consecrated Glories, and a Pomp Divine. The Rites begin, the Choirs now raise Their Voice to Heav'n in Sacred Hymns of Praise, While from the loaded Altars come Rich curling Clouds of od'rous Fume: On trembling Flames the Spicy Vapours rise, And all along perfume the Skies; On gilded Roofs the blazing Altars play, And down in streaming Gold reflect a burnish'd Day. III. The wanton Zephyrs, dancing Hours, With various Dye retouch the Flow'rs: The purple Bramble, ruddy Bush, Glowing with Syrian Roses blush, The Trees fresh Honours wear; And Buds unfurling clothe the Earth, To celebrate the double Birth Of This young Fav'rite, and the new-born Year. For Nature, Madam, as she knew Your Time approach'd, in Compliment to You In Labour falls, and brings forth too: The Birds in Songs salute the Lovely Boy, And the well-pleas'd Creation seems to smile for Joy. IV. Now Flora, and the Wood-Nymphs bring The blooming Beauties of the Spring, A suitable, a gay, and fragrant Offering. Over his Head the Goddess stands, And scatters Presents from her lavish Hands: From her full Lap her gaudy Wealth she pours, And wraps his fragrant Limbs in Wreaths of Flow'rs. And lo! the Flow'rs, as if they took New Order, Life, and Beauty from his Look, Like some well-marshall'd Band about Him grow, At once to guard Him, and to grace Him too. Each Blossom, and each swelling Bud Bend down their Heads, and in Obedience nod; To pay their Homage they around Him bow, And Lillies drop their Leaves, like silent Flakes of Snow. The mingling Vi'lets here, and Daysies meet: He more than bright-ey'd Daysies fair, and more than Vi'lets sweet. V. Love's beauteous Goddess from afar Drawn in her bright triumphant Car, Glides like a falling Meteor thro' the Air: Smiles, Mirth, and young Desires about Her fly, Laugh on Her Cheeks, and revel in Her Eye. Fair Venus does the Infant dress With ev'ry Beauty, ev'ry Grace; To Him She ev'ry Charm applies, And breathes a tender Glory round his scarce enlighten'd Eyes. VI. When first the Mother's Plastick Womb began To mould the Rudiments of future Man, A vig'rous Nature rang'd with wond'rous Art The proper Seeds design'd for ev'ry Part; Temper'd by Her, the Elements agree, In Symmetry advance, and decent Harmony. The Matter thus dispos'd, there wanted yet A Form to make the Work compleat. When lo! an Agent free, and rational, The breathing Soul, diffus'd it self thro' all: The well-acquainted Stranger, knowing Guest, The bubbling Spring of Life possess't, And flutt'ring in its new-born Seat, Bid the unpractis'd Blood to leap, and taught the Heart to beat. At once the nimble Spirits ran Thro' all the winding Mazes of the Brain: They thro' each Limb the Flow of Life maintain, And trace the blue Meanders of each branching Vein, Thus Chaos in her Universal Womb Prepar'd the Seeds of all Things yet to come. Then o're the Mass a Spirit brooding sate, Scatt'ring thro' all a vital Heat, And as it did the Genial Warmth dispose, A beauteous, new, and perfect World arose. VII. Well fare the Hand that did the Child enlarge, And brought forth the important Charge. Thus with much Pains, and Skill, the Indians hew From Eastern Quarries harden'd Pearly Dew, And as they downward go, Disclose another Firmament below: The flaming Rock of Gems looks gay and bright, Of Beams condens'd, and fix'd substantial Light. Say (Muse) for sure Thou know'st it, say, Which was the Happy Day? And let it be recorded straight In th' Adamantine Book of Fate; Let it some Mark peculiar wear, Distinct from vulgar Days that crowd the Year. From Me it always shall receive The Noblest Present that the Muse can give, The Muse his growing Virtues shall rehearse, And Yearly Homage pay in Tributary Verse. VIII. The Muse, with her all-darting Eye, Commands the Prospect of Futurity; And soaring on a Wing sublime, Peeps down into the dusky Nest of Time; Does there with curious Search survey The Seedlings of first Moments thinly wrought, That scarce admit of Human Thought; Hid in their secret Cell, their Womb, and Grave; That when in Being, scarce a Being have: With Minutes yet unborn, and Hours that forming lie. Here some with new-fledg'd Pinions painted gay, Wing thro' the yawning Egg their silent Way; While Part like Embrio's in the Womb, Yet immature for Motion, dwell In their unextended Shell, And ripen there to fashion Years to come. Now with the Sun their airy Course they take Obliquely thro' the figur'd Zodiack, And as along they smiling go, The nimble-footed Hours bestow New Blessings on the Joyful World below. Methinks I see Thessalian Tempe raise Its lofty Head with never-dying Bays; The Learned Springs o'reflow with Joy, And, in as unconfin'd a Course As the licentious Numbers of my Verse, Run prattling thro' the Fields in wanton Play, And flow'ry Garlands roll to paint His bright triumphant Way. IX. The Eaglet patient of God Phœbus Ray, That dares the open Flames of Day, That with an undisturb'd, and stedfast Sight Provokes the dazzling Beams of Empyreal Light, The Royal Eagle will vouchsafe to own; Instructed by the Judgment of the Sun: When by his ordeal Fire's decisive Blaze, The Testimony's given Of a sincere, ingenuous Race, And the young Prince has stood the Test of Heav'n. This the apparent Heir his Rays declare, By Patent of Inheritance to bear The dreadful Engine of the Thunderer. Nor need You (Sir) your genuine Issue try By any other Sun, or Sky Than that of his own Mother's brighter Eye. And thus your Offspring may like Honours know, And weild the Thunder of our Jove below. X. Rash were the Task, shou'd I attempt to draw Those matchless Features which I never saw, Shou'd I design th'imperfect Draught, By the wild Pencil of the Fancy taught. All vulgar Forms You must transcend, The Noble Choice of my Judicious Friend. The Youth at Court had scarcely been, E're He had your surprizing Graces seen; With One swift Glance his Heart was won: He came, He saw, and was undone. Here Thousand Beauties might demand His Love, Beauties more Heav'nly, more Divine Than those that Glorious Stars now shine, And reign o're Men below, and Gods above. With a regardless Look He These did view, They suffer'd in Comparison with You; Your Eyes directed where the Prize shou'd fall, And loudly claim'd His Present of the Golden Ball. And now You were by Hymen led A blushing Virgin to the Genial Bed; While Heav'n, your Nuptial Joys to crown, At length has bless'd You with a Son, Sent from Paternal Sky, His native Home; An Earnest of the Pledges yet to come. XI. Nature has unexhausted Store, And She that One produc'd, can furnish more. Within the Parent Quiver lie Arrows which, tho' unplum'd, yet wait to fly: That Chasing in the Child-bed Strife, Will yearly shoot, and kindle into Life. The feather'd Prodigy Acestes sent, Thus trail'd new Fires along the Firmament, That soaring left a Track of Flame, Which upward blaz'd thro' spacious Heav'n his Name, Mounted aloft in Virgil's Verse, to Everlasting Fame. Kissing a Young LADY. I. Soft Virgin Blossom, Beauty's sweetest Prize, Thou fairest Light, and Comfort of mine Eyes, Permit the Humblest of your Train, At length to make a Truce with Pain; And on your pouting Lips moist Kisses taste, To quench the boyling Fever in my Breast: Your Lips that, big with humid Kisses, shew Like swelling Rose-buds gemm'd with Pearly Dew. Then, as my eager Love your Lips devours, Let Kisses fall in soft distilling Show'rs, And with their healing Drops impart A Balm to ease, and cool my burning Heart. II. Ah me! a Curse attends my fond Desires; Those Lips, those glowing Lips remove, That shed no Dews, but drop down melting fires, The more to torture, and enrage my Love. So fierce the Flame it cannot be withstood, It Life devours, and drinks up all my Blood, The grosser Seeds enlarg'd retire, And, the whole Frame dissolv'd, in Ashes I expire. III. Yet say, my Charmer, tell me why Do You withdraw your Lips from mine? Who on that Altar wou'd not wish to die? Then bring, O! bring your Kisses back again. The welcome Death that thus arrives Is of more Value than a Thousand Lives. 'Twas thus Great Hercules did upward go, For Heav'n refin'd by Fires below; On OEta's Flames triumphantly he rode, And from a Mortal, mounted to a God. Worcester Dumb Bells. I I Sing the Famous City Where once loud Guns did bluster, And will ring you a Peal, May be heard very well, Tho' the Bells were not at Wor'ster. CHORUS. From Senates Heav'n defend us; Our Trebles, and our Tenors, These Per'llous Times, May be Su'd for High Crimes, And Impeach'd for Misdemeanors. III But wou'd you know the Reason Of this their sad Condition? All his Diocess round, Old Proph. against Sound Had issu'd a Prohibition. From Senates, &amp;c. IV No Church, no Tow'r, or Steeple Was from his Wrath defended, The Bells High, and Low, Ab Offi—ci—o, Were doubly now suspended. From Senates, &amp;c. V Thus Bellfreys all were silenc'd; But what more new and strange is, No Allowance was found, For the Bells to ring round, For fear of sudden Changes. From Senates, &amp;c. VI Those brazen Mouths that bellow When Fate, and Death defeat us, Now think it full hard, They shou'd be debarr'd From Ringing their own Quietus. From Senates, &amp;c. VII But, since they all lay speechless, A Spirit so discerning, By his parlous Wit, Presum'd it was fit The Clappers shou'd put on Mourning. From Senates, &amp;c. VIII True to the Churches Int'rest, And of all Metals sparing, Good Man he much fear'd, If the Clappers were hear'd, The Bells might be worse for wearing. From Senates, &amp;c. IX But Whiggs now, and False Brethren, Bilk'd of Election-Money, Will order, no doubt, The Bells to ring out For the Death of Old Volpone. From Senates, &amp;c. X You've heard of Fryar Bacon, In good Time be it spoken, For Speeches too proud, And Ringing too loud, His Brazen Head was broken. From Senates, &amp;c. XI Prophetically Peals were Deny'd to Man of Prayer, Since once, as Fame tells, The Ringing of Bells Made Whittington Lord Mayor. From Senates, &amp;c. XII Our Seer then with good Reason Made Sexton shut up his Shop; For if Bells cou'd afford To make City Lord, They may as well—Lord Bishop. From Senates, &amp;c. XIII As when Disciple sullen Won't tell what Part of Speech 'tis, Persists in the Wrong, But recovers his Tongue, By letting down his Breeches. From Senates, &amp;c. XIV So Metals, ne're so sturdy, At Hammer's Provocation, From Silence were found To wake into Sound, And chime out a Recantation. From Senates, &amp;c. XV Compell'd to Non-Resistance, And Sov'raign Mob's Allegiance, Prohibited Bells Were bang'd into Peals, And thump'd into Obedience. From Senates, &amp;c. XVI I mean Obedience Passive, A Duty which in fact is Of Force with us still, (So says Prelate Will:) But Occasional as to Practice. From Senates, &amp;c. XVII But O these woful Tonies, And Politicians awkward! By Incendiary fir'd, The Nation requir'd At least to ring 'em backward. From Senates, &amp;c. XVIII Old England, I bemoan thee, How sorrowful thy Case is! Church Clappers deny'd, While the Tongues are unti'd Of Prophet Balaam's Asses. From Senates, &amp;c. XIX The Nation sure must thrive well Under such able Teachers, Where Bishops set Spells To silence our Bells, State-Ministers our Preachers. From Senates, &amp;c. XX Yet Bellfreys, spite of Party, And to the Whiggs Confusion, Will soon, we have Hopes, Find Clappers, and Ropes To ring at their Dissolution. From Senates, &amp;c. Grand CHORUS. God save our Glorious ANNA, Our Churches Great Defender; Heav'n send us a Peace, And a speedy Release Of our Gracious Queen from Bender. Cupid Confin'd. I The winged Boy, in wanton Flight Descending from his airy Height, Into Panthea's Bosom fled, And made the Downy Nest his Bed. II Her softer Bosom gently rose, Seeming to court Him to Repose; Nestling He folds his Wings to creep Between her Breasts,—then falls asleep. III Pleas'd, and transported with the Joy, She smil'd at the deluded Boy, While busy Thoughts, and Hands prepare Close to confine the Wand'rer there. IV She takes a various-colour'd Braid Of Scarlet, Gold, and Purple made; And ah! hard-hearted, cruel She Pinion'd the little Deity. V But when surpriz'd He wak'd, and found His Limbs in Silken Fetters bound, He sighing pray'd the Fair wou'd please To grant her Captive a Release. VI Fair Youth (says She) wou'd you begon, Your warm Apartment leave so soon? No, gentle Boy, you must discharge Your Lodgings, to be set at large. VII Then, for a Bribe to let me go, Here take my Quiver—take my Bow;— Nor can I greater Triumphs boast, Than that my Arms to You were lost. VIII Now, proudly waving in her Hand Those Ensigns of her new Command, She freed the God;—who now complains That He's refus'd to wear her Chains. IX And now those Shafts are his no more, His Bow's no longer in his Pow'r; Panthea now alone commands Love's Darts, Alone She charms all Eyes, alone She wounds all Hearts. SONG. [I Saw Lucinda's Bosom bare] I I Saw Lucinda's Bosom bare, Transparent was the Skin, As thro' a Crystal, did appear. A beating Heart within. II The beating Heart transfix'd I saw, And yet the Heart was Stone; I saw it bleed, and by the Wound I thought it was mine own. III But O! when I perceiv'd it was Enshrin'd within your Breast, I knew 'twas yours: for mine, alas! Was never yet so blest. Partly imitated from the XVth Ode of the First Book of Horace. I. Return, Unhappy Prince, return; O tempt not thy unwilling Fate! Nor let the fair OEnone mourn, Who loves so well, but ill deserves thy Hate: Trust not the Wind, the faithless Wind, and Sea, As Thou to Her, so they'll prove false to Thee. II. The beauteous Freight thy Navy shall bring Home Will soon deceive thy promis'd Joy, For with Confed'rate Arms all Greece shall come Thy Father Priam's Kingdoms to destroy. Trust not the Winds, &amp;c. III. In vain, exceedingly in vain Shalt thou with Perfumes scent thy Hair, While to thy Lute thou sing'st some am'rous Strain; And Voice, and Hand conspire to charm the Fair: Successless here thy gentlest Airs will sound, In the shrill Trumpet's louder Clangors drown'd. IV. Pallas enrag'd does now prepare Her Breast-Plate, Crested Helm, and Shield, And in the horrid Pomp of War Rattles her Chariot o're the dusty Field; And, e're Ten rolling Years expire, Troy's Sacred Walls shall flame in Grecian Fire. The Irresistible BEAUTY. As when a Comet does in Heav'n appear Not to give Light, but trembling Mortals Fear; Nations look up with Terror, and Surprize, And see large Ruins hanging in the Skies; Expecting when Contagious Fires will throw Their scatter'd Vengeance on the World below: So when Panthea's Eyes dilate their Beams, Around discharging bright destructive Flames, Whole Kingdoms stand amaz'd:—yet doubtful all On whom they'll light, or where they're doom'd to fall. To shun those Shafts there's no Protection giv'n, For all must dread the Brand, that falls from Heav'n. Now Rival Monarchs, warm'd with am'rous Rage, For this fair Prize contending, all engage; Unhappy Princes that employ their Pow'r To make themselves more wretched than before! No Human Conduct, nor Divine is found Of Force to ward off, or elude the Wound; Nor can their num'rous Armies all suffice To guard 'em from her Bright, Victorious Eyes. A DIALOGUE Between A Gypsie Boy, and a Girl. Designed for the STAGE. Boy.] All the Blessings of Mankind fall on thee, sweet Miss; Shall I tell thee Good Fortune?— Girl.] I hate your black Phiz: Whate're you pretend, I am sure you can see By the Lines of my Hand no Good Fortune for me. Boy.] No, no, Child, I know by the Rules of my Art, Thou bear'st thy Good Fortune—in some other Part; You've a Mole, and a Dimple.— Girl.] I pray in what Place? Boy.] Why then to be plain—I mean not in thy Face. Nay more, You're in Love, Child.— Girl.] How does that appear? 'Tis not with a Man.— Boy.] Yes, with ev'ry Man here. At one Look I can see both within, and without thee, Discover thy Thoughts, and all Things about thee. Thy Shoes,—they are Turky—thy Stockings— Girl.] are Blue, Boy.] Thy Garters are Red.— Girl.] By this Light he says true: Boy.] And now I am in, by my Skill shall be shown Who gave you the Ribbon to garter it on. Girl.] Sweet Gypsie, forbear.— Boy.] It all comes out, Miss. Girl.] Hold thy Tongue,—or I'll strike thee quite dumb—with a Kiss. Boy.] Nay since you provoke me, if I had a Mind, I cou'd tell you to whom too you lately were kind, Who rumpl'd, who tumbl'd, who cours'd you about, Put his Hand in your Neck,—and made you squall out; I know all as well as if I had seen ye, When he caught you— Girl.] Ah hold—I think the Devil's in ye. Cupid's Banishment. I Cupid of mighty Conquests proud, Of Kings o'recome, and Gods subdu'd, His Fellow Deities alarms With all the boasted Triumphs of his Arms. II Displeas'd, and taking just Offence At his provoking Insolence, The Pow'rs against him jointly move, And from the Heav'ns they chase the God of Love. III Banish'd from thence, to Earth he flies, And finds New Heav'ns in Chloe's Eyes, Against the Gods plots Vengeance there, And from their Angry Shafts denounces War. IV But soon She does their Rage abate; The God as soon suspends his Hate; The soft Emotions of her Eyes With such resistless Sweets surprize, He of his Injuries complains no more, Forgets both Heav'n, and Gods, and scorns their Pow'r. SONG at a BALL. That all Things were form'd by a DANCE. I Before the Unborn World saw Light, Wrapt in the Darksom Womb of Night, The sluggish Mass, dissolv'd in Rest, Lay without Form, and all undress'd: But when Jove thunder'd, Let it Be, Old Night, and frighted Chaos flee, And at the Dawn of the first Day, The young World smil'd, and all Things danc'd for Joy. II The Seeds now diff'rent Motions know; Some round, some strait, some swift, some slow; The Air, and Element of Fire On their ambitious Wings aspire; While pressing down, the other Two By Impulse to the Center go: Thus Things in various Figures fall, And with a num'rous Dance compose this All. III The Creatures did at first advance To praise their Maker with a Dance. By Musick tun'd, the Stars tript round To their own Spheres Harmonious Sound: The Rivers, as along they glide, Danc'd to the Bubblings of their Tide: So, charm'd by Orpheus's pow'rful Song, The Woods, and Mountains leap'd, and danc'd along. IV And when the March of Life began, Then, in the lesser World of Man, The nimble Blood sprang in the Heart, Wand'ring in Streams thro' ev'ry Part: Each beating Art'ry, ev'ry Vein The sprightly Round of Life contain; On Motion all Things here depend, And when the Dance of Nature's done, must end. To CHLOE. Lovely Chloe, Chaste, and Fair, As Morning Virgin Blushes are, Love's Goddess, and each smiling Grace Are drawn in Triumph on your Face: So, when kind Heav'n descends in Show'rs, Spring blooms with Sweets, and laughs in Flow'rs. Ah! Chloe be not so severe, But grant your Lover's gentle Pray'r, And O be merciful, as you are fair. Permit a Wretch, that bleeding lies, To kiss those sweet, Enchanting Eyes, Your Eyes, that equal Flames display To that bright God's, that rules the Day; Thus whilst rash Pha'ton wou'd approve His Title to his Father's Love, He to a Province had Regard Which was for Gods themselves too hard; His tow'ring Thoughts did so aspire, He burnt with such a fierce Desire As set himself, and all the World on Fire. And, Chloe, thus, if you consent, The Grant becomes my Punishment. Ah! fair Ingrate! and must I mourn Beneath your Pride, beneath your Scorn? Can you this small Return refuse For all th' Applauses of my Muse? I first did on your Eyes bestow Those pointed Shafts that wound me so. Thus when Perillus wou'd engage The Tyrant, he instructs his Rage: And so, by his own Art betray'd, First prov'd the Torments which he made. Can you my Passion then disclaim? Or do you wanton with my Flame? And all these am'rous Arts employ, But to improve th' approaching Joy? Or do you thus my Courtship fly, And, what you covet most, deny; That you the Pleasure may receive, Yet with Reluctance seem to give? But thus unwilling as thou art, I'll seize on ev'ry charming Part; My Arms around your Neck will twine, And press your trembling Lips to mine; Then to your Eyes I will remove, And on those Eyes will feast my Love; Now tho' you struggle and complain, Deny, and then deny again, Chide, threaten, weep, and rage, yet all is vain; I nor your Lips, nor Eyes will spare, But print a Thousand Kisses there; Kisses that shall new Flames impart, Fire all the Blood, and melt your Heart. Shou'd those fair Hands, form'd to embrace, Cruelly furrow up my Face, Insensible of Pain or Fear, Those Wounds, those am'rous Wounds, I'll bear; And as you urge the Wounds more deep, The more they bleed, the more you weep, My Kisses deeper shall be press't, I'll hug thee closer to my Breast, Till I have rifl'd all your Charms, And you lie breathless in my Arms. Chloe, if you desire to bless Your faithful Lover with Success, Thus still unwilling Force employ, That I may snatch th' unwilling Joy, And as I ravish the sweet Prize, New Joys shall thence, new Pleasures rise. For riper Fruits with Pains we go To reach them from some lofty Bough, While others unregarded hang below: With Labour we to Noblest Things aspire; He first scal'd Heav'n, that stole Celestial Fire. The 17th Elegy of the Second Book OF Ovid's AMOURS imitated. If it be scandalous to Love, I own My Self the most notorious Rake in Town. But hang dull Reputation, so I find My Gentle Mistress fav'rably inclin'd, Just to her Vows, and to my Wishes kind. Triumphant Charms Corinna's Face adorn, And ev'ry Conquest yields new Cause of Scorn; From hence her Pride, and my Misfortunes grow, The Nymph is beautiful, and knows She's so; Her flatt'ring Mirror fresh Disdain supplies, And gives new Coyness to her killing Eyes. Yet, Lovely Maid, you ought not to disdain The Homage paid you by your Humble Swain: Celestial Nymphs have left Ethereal Charms, To be more Happy in a Mortal's Arms; Great Numa thus Egeria's Heart cou'd move, Religion the Pretence, their Bus'ness Love; A Sham so Holy favour'd her Desire, And He enflam'd Her with a Nobler Fire. Enact, Dear Sov'raign Queen, as you think fit, To all the Laws you pass, I must submit; Your Laws can never be too rig'rous made, If kindly giv'n, and ratify'd in Bed. My Love will be no Scandal to your Fame, Nor need you blush to own my Gen'rous Flame; In Poetry I have a Large Estate, In Boundless Fancy my Revenue's great; And there is many a willing Nymph that sues To raise her Reputation by my Muse. I hear a Rival Beauty boasts, that She Is that Corinna sung so well by me; She fondly strives to rob You of your Fame, Proud of the borrow'd Lustre of your Name; But I have vow'd that You alone shall shine, Like a Rich Gem, in ev'ry Page of Mine. Then kindly smile on Me, my Fair, and I Will pay Thee back with Immortality. To a Jilting Mistress. Discourteous Damsel! what a Devil, Cou'd make thy Person so uncivil? Did you not swear while Moon did shine, With those Dear Lips, and Eyes of thine, (Bewitching Eyes that glance more bright Than Ev'ning-Star, or Cynthia's Light) That you wou'd bilk domestick Spies, And Mother's second-sighted Eyes; Yet after all the Vows you made, To leave both them, and me unpaid! To violate your Faith and Troth, And break my Heart to break your Oath! It was disast'rous you shou'd swear By that false Light; for you, I fear, Have learn'd Inconstancy from her; Since to my Grief alas! I see She changes not so oft as thee! Cynthia her self left Heav'n to keep, As Poets sing, Endymion's Sheep, Resolving to solace with Crony, She took the Shepherd for her Honey; In Lanthorn dark enclos'd her Light, And play'd upon his Pipe all Night; The Shepherdess her Lover charms, And hugs him folded in her Arms. By Night She play'd; for if you mark, Lovers perform best in the dark; And hence the Tiny God we find Is always represented blind. This Whipster keeps perpetual Racket, Enflames this Codpiece, and that Placket; The hood-wink'd Link-boy blindly leads Prentice to Mistress Bed, for Maid's; Makes Gib-Cats clapperclaw their Spouses, And clatter Tiles on Tops of Houses; Great Lords for Dears mistake their Woman, And Rampant Duchesses grow common; Night-Errant Peers with Stars and Garters, To Garrets climb for Winter-Quarters, And make the Tour of Petty-France With Honi Soit Qui Mal y Pense. All Things in Earth, in Air, or Sky, That sink, or swim, that creep, or fly, The Herds of two Legs, and of four Pursue the Sweets of an Amour; True to their Mates are Beasts and Birds, And scorn, like You, to break their Words. Some Hours b'ing pass'd 'twixt Hopes and Fears, The Bell beat Six into my Ears; List'ning I stood, unmov'd as Stock, My Heart just striking with the Clock; Then down sat Pil, like silly Ass, Expecting what ne're came to pass: I here, in pensive Thought, contrive all Methods to welcome your Arrival; At length I grew confounded jealous, So fell to reprimand my Bellows; I puff'd and blow'd while Flames increas'd, Both in my Stove, and in my Breast; On Tiptoe then I tript, almost As light as Midnight Thief, or Ghost: At the least Breath I heard, methoughts, The Rustling of your Petticoats; False Petticoats that did convey A Signal of approaching Joy! But 'twas imaginary Silk, Instructed like the true, to bilk: Then melancholy Ditty humming, I made Excuse for your not Coming; Said I, I'll hold my self a Crown, My Dear is Pinning up her Gown, Dressing her Head, or what's as good, She's putting on her Scarf and Hood, Her whole Attire adjusting,—and Drawing white Kid on whiter Hand. Now as I walk'd in sad Despair, I thought your Foot saluted Stair, Pit-pat it went, and ev'n like that My flutt'ring Heart went pit-a-pat. Why shou'd you thus your Freedom fetter, And put on Chains, to give me greater? Torture your self, and take a vain, Affected Pleasure in my Pain? So founder'd Bawd, when She in Chace is Of fresh young Ware with pretty Faces, Industriously jogs up and down, To fire their Bums, and warm her own. How can you dozing sit hum drum, Before your Jacks and Wire at Home, When you're an Instrument much fitter, Tun'd for more sprightly Jiggs, and sweeter? There can be no great Pleasure in it, Whether you sing, or thump your Spinnet; If no Admirers round you stand, T' applaud the Touches of your Hand, No list'ning Youths about you throng, To kiss the Mouth that breath'd the Song. As in no single String is found A Correspondency of Sound; So we small Musick make, or none, In either Sex, when we're alone; Where proper Parts with Parts agree, In that, and Love, 'tis Harmony. Perhaps you're well—but for my part, You've broke my Sleep, and crack'd my Heart; And it wou'd vex you, shou'd your Scorning Behold my Courage down next Morning, Your Champion fall'n, laid out for dead, Unable to support his Head: You are the only Person found, That wears the Balm to Cure my Wound. Then, Dear Physician, haste; but prithee Fail not to bring the Balsam with thee; And when recover'd, on my Knees In Love, not Gold, I'll pay thy Fees. The WOUND. How faithless is Love's wand'ring Fire, That with false Light misleads Desire! It is a self-consuming Joy, That its own Being does destroy: The heedless Youth to Rage inclines, And renders vain what he designs. Thus I unwarily survey'd The tempting, soft, bewitching Maid; My Lips with shooting Passion bound, And every Kiss indents a Wound. Our Laws respectfully provide Against the bold Offender's Pride, That strikes in Courts, where awful Kings reside. Dismember'd there they meet Disgrace, For daring to prophane the Place; What Punishment must then pursue! What Vengeance to my Crime be due! Since I with Blood her Breast cou'd stain, Where Cytherea and her Train Revel in Pleasures, and triumphant Reign; Her heav'nly Breast, the bless'd Abode Of ev'ry wanton, smiling God. Ah wretched Heart, did you but know What Goddess you have made your Foe! You'd tremble, sure, the Mark to be Of that avenging Deity, Whose Thunder pointed at thy Head, But waits Command to strike thee dead. Not the bright Shield of Thetis Son, With which Troy's ancient Walls were won, For Vict'ry form'd by Hands Divine, Did with such Conqu'ring Glories shine, E're made so many Heroes yield, Or, like those Eyes, maintain'd the Field. Dismiss your Frowns, least Innocence And Beauty grieve for my Offence. Shou'd Heav'n with Tempests charge its Brow For each Impiety below, Those Golden Lamps no more wou'd burn, But all in Clouds and Darkness mourn. By all the Purple Wounds you bear, And O believe when thus I swear, Believe me, (for by Heav'n 'tis true,) My Thoughts were far from inj'ring You; Witness Love's Queen, and Thou, who art The greater Goddess of my Heart, And those Dear Eyes, which far above My own I prize, my own I love. Soon as your snowy Breasts all bare To my transported Eyes appear, Your Breasts, whose kindly Clusters shine Round, plump, and big with juicy Wine, Ripe as the Grapes that load the Autumn Vine; Drunk with their Beauty's Wine, I rave To see 'em tremble, pant, and heave. And, stung with Extasy, impress'd The bleeding Wound upon your Breast, From whence shou'd stream a milky Food To feed the Boy, Love's Infant God, He'll grow a Tyrant now H''as tasted Blood. Since my Offence was Love's Excess, Let Love the Faults of Love redress: If that will not your Wrath appease, Ordain for Me what Pains You please; The most tormenting Punishment, That injur'd Maid cou'd e're invent; For I with Pleasure can sustain A Thousand Deaths, to ease your Pain. Alas! who can his Crimes avert, When Love predestinates the Heart! 'Twas your proud Form that did inspire My Breast with this resistless Fire; Your Tyrant Beauty my wild Passion wrought, And I but practis'd, what your Eyes first taught. Made over a Punch-Bowl. The first Deluge of Water wash'd Mankind away, But this Second of Punch wou'd invite us to stay: O! had this Noble Liquor been rightly employ'd! It the World had restor'd, which the Water destroy'd. This full Bowl is our Ark, where we safely may sail, Thro' an Ocean of Punch,—while we Sing for a Gale. THE Miller's TALE. FROM Geoffrey Chaucer. In Days of Old, if Story does not err, In Oxford dwelt an aged Carpenter; But tho' with Riches he was amply stor'd, Greedy of Pelf, he Scholars kept at Board; Daily he thriv'd, and thriving learn'd to Save; A Jealous Dotard, and a Purse proud Knave. It so befel, a Youngster of the Gown, For his Diversion, took a Room in Town At this old Carpenter's good Mansion-House; He let the Room—the Scholar paid his Spouse. A Youth He was of most accomplish'd Parts, Deep read in Sciences, and learn'd in Arts; But to Astrology he most inclin'd, To that the Stars had influenc'd his Mind. You cou'd propose no Question e're so nice, But he resolv'd the Problem in a Trice, And drew infallible Conclusions by The sure Determinations of the Sky; No Almanack cou'd half so well explain The dire Contingences of Drought, or Rain; No Farmer in the Neighbourhood around, Without Consulting him, broke up his Ground; And Husbandmen their Contributions pay, To know when they shou'd Reap, or Cock their Hay: He'd form a Diagram, and there descry The Horoscope of a Nativity; And much enlarge on num'rous Cuckolds born Beneath the Forked Star of Capricorn: He corresponded with the Heav'nly Signs, Conjunctions, Aspects, Quartils, and their Trines; And Stars wou'd tip the Wink, to let him know What Sublunary Thieves, or Lovers did below. He by his Knowledge purchas'd goodly Fame, And Gentle Nich'las was this Artist's Name; His Maiden Looks profess'd a Saint-like Grace, And well-dissembl'd Truth bely'd his Face; The Sophister a Graduate might prove In all th' Intrigues and secret Arts of Love; And when to solace, Phillis gave Occasion, He punctually obey'd her Assignation. With trusty Fondle Wife (as we have said) He boarded; and to propagate his Trade, Alone Apartment to himself he had: The Chamber well his blooming Thoughts express'd, Spruc'd up with chearful Greens, and quaintly dress'd, Myrtles, and Flow'rs in Sweets confus'dly meet, Sweet were the Greens, and Flow'rs, but he himself more sweet. On a Decyph'ring Table, near the Bed, His Astrologick Schemes, and Globes were laid, His Astrolabe, that long'd to shew his Art, With Constellation Stones, were set apart: Upon a Shelf were Authors rang'd on high, With the fam'd Almagist of Ptolomy; Whence he his Cant purloin'd, and learned Banters, Colures, Azimuthals, and Almicanters. His Press was with a Scarlet Carpet grac'd, Where he his tuneful Instrument had plac'd, On which a nights harmoniously he play'd, With Strings and Voice such Melody he made, He play'd so sweet, the Chamber ecchoing rung, And Angelus ad Virginem he sung: Full many a Sonnet bless'd his warbling Throat, Shrill as the Lark, as merry was his Note. The Carpenter, devoid of Sense and Grace, (As it is many an Honest Townsman's Case) But newly wedded had a Buxom Wife, That he more dearly tender'd than his Life; The gamesom Filly was about Eighteen, Barb'ry her Shape, her Pasterns strait and clean, Which made the Sot his Charge in Durance keep, Lest She promiscuously shou'd steal a Leap: For She was wild, and young; He tame, and old, And thought all Cuckolds sprung from Heat and Cold; Unlearn'd, he ne're had read Sage Cato's Rules, Which preach this Maxim from the Moral Schools, That who in Disproportion wed, are Fools. Man ought to Couple with an equal Mate, For Youth and Age get nothing—but Debate; The Husband Aged, and a Youthful Dame, His chilling Snow but ill requites her Flame: But since the Gull was fall'n into the Snare, He must endure what Fellow-Suff'rers bear, And think that She from Others will receive The Love He cannot, and which They can give. The Wife was wond'rous Fair, and therewithal Her gentle Body, as the Weezel, small; She wore a Girdle of Brocaded Silk, Her Apron whiter was than Morning Milk, Purfl'd about, it fell in Pleats all o're; Clean was her Smock—embroider'd down before, The Collar round with Needle-Work was wrought, Black as her Eyes, and wanton as her Thought; In glossy Rounds the jetty Bugles deck The graceful Column of her snowy Neck: Her Kercheif was of Lawn, with Ribbons ty'd In mazy Knots, and complicated Pride; Just on the less'ning Calf her Buskins fall, And gayly lac'd the well-proportion'd Small: Her Fillet broad of Silk, was set full high; And the young Wanton had a liqu'rish Eye: Her Eyebrows pincht like slender Arches grow, Bending in Shades, and blacker than a Sloe; Her spangl'd Purse with tawdry Colours dy'd, Tassell'd with Silk, hung dangling by her Side; Her ev'ry Garment, with a Rival Air, Contended which shou'd most adorn the Fair: Her Beauty and Attire each other grace, Her Face the Dress commends, the Dress her Face. Her shining Hue was brighter to behold Than new coin'd Angels, or the Noble-Gold: Her Genial Songs full gladsom Notes express'd; So Sparrows chirping tread, and build their Nest: But to her Voice She like a Kid wou'd bound, Frisking in Air, too light to touch the Ground. Her lovely Mouth, and Lips of Ruby, shew Like blushing Cherries pearl'd with Morning Dew: Not spicy Wines such Fragrancies display, Nor Apples hoarded in new-tedded Hay: Wincing She was, as is a jolly Colt, Long as a Mast, and upright as a Bolt: Not Down of Swans, or Blossoms on the Tree Were half so soft, so sweet, so beautiful as She. The Charmer was created for Delight, Form'd to provoke a Monarch's Appetite, A Venus fit to wanton by Jove's Side, Or yet to make a good convenient Vulcan's Bride. Now Sir, and oft Sir, thus befel the Case; Upon a Day this Gentle Nicholas (While the good Husband was to Os'ney gone, And the young Wife was kindly left alone) Began his am'rous Passion to declare, And with outrageous Love attack'd the Fair; He kiss'd—he ogl'd her—with Ardor press't Her balmy Hand, and squeez'd her heaving Breast; Then wantonly he stole down by degrees, First strok'd her swelling Thigh, then grasp'd her Knees, Till his impatient Hand like Lightning flew To a strange Place—which scarce her Husband knew; (There He had been indeed, but been in vain, Gave Her small Pleasure, and Himself much Pain.) One Arm in strictest Folds the Fair embrac'd, Clinging like Ivy round her slender Waste. “For Love of You (says he) I inly mourn, “All Night I languish, and all Day I burn. “Permit me then—or I will ne're remove, “O grant me—or I perish for your Love; “Thus on your panting Bosom will I lie, “Here conquer, or—upon this Spot will die. Now, as in Passion, from his Arms She sprung, Far from his Kisses back her Head She flung, Writhing her twining Neck, as rack'd with Pain, But whisper'd Kindness, tho' She look'd Disdain; Half-smiling, and half-frowning She appears, And Venus seem'd to chuckle thro' her Tears; Says She—“You shall not—Heav'ns—nay fie—forbear, “I shall cry out,—and somebody may hear. Thus as they in the wanton Battel strove, He boldly storm'd, and seiz'd the Fort of Love; Nor cou'd She longer now the Foe withstand, The Articles of Peace were in his Hand. Yet Gentle Nich'las, fearing to displease, Fell, and ask'd Pardon on his bended Knees; He pray'd—he swore—and promis'd her so fast, That She as kindly promis'd him at last. “You naughty Men have the prevailing Arts “To tyrannize o're silly Women's Hearts, “Undone by You, we fondly seek no Aid, “In Love most happy, when by Love betray'd; Then swore devoutly by St. Becket's Shrine, “Thine will I be (quoth She) and only thine, “Whenever by kind Absence I am free “From my old Husband's watchful Jealousy: “But I enjoin You, that You cautious prove, “And on your Life be secret in your Love; “For shou'd You not to Secresy incline, “The rash Discov'ry may endanger mine. “Since I am bless'd (said he) with your Consent, “Leave this Intrigue to my sole Management; “The Scholar idly has employ'd his Study, “That of thy Logwood cannot make a Noddy. Thus Both agreed, and mutually they swore To wait the Time, as 'tis express'd before— Then after he had taken lusty Pains To warm her Gaskins well, and thump'd her Loyns, Thick on her Lips he patt'ring Kisses laid; Then sirk'd his Fiddle, and like wild he play'd, With eager Joy elate, he loudly sings, Swift flew his Bow, and scarcely touch'd the Strings. It so befel, upon an Holy-Day, The beauteous Convert went to Church to pray; But first bethought her to consult her Glass, And there in private She confess'd her Face, Absolv'd from venial Stains her Beauties shone, In Lustre equal to the Mid-day Sun. Now of this Church there was a Parish-Clerk Icleped Absolon—a furious Spark, His Goldy Locks were curl'd, and from his Head On each Side op'ning, like a Fan, they spread; His Countenance Vermilion was; his Eyes Grey as a Goose's, and he look'd as wise; He tripp'd full featly with a mincing Pace, In Hosen red, and an affected Grace; And as on Bread and Butter Children use, He wore Glass-Windows printed on his Shoes. His Azure Vest thick set with Points, embrac'd And narrowly confin'd his spiny Waste; His Surplice over all did downward flow, Fair as the Blossom whit'ning on the Bough. A merry Child he was, a parlous Knave, Well cou'd he use the Lancet, Clip, or Shave, Or draw a Lease, as if h' had learn'd by Heart The Barber-Surgeon's, and the Lawyer's Art; His various Legs he threw in Figures rare, And coupee'd with a Courtly Oxford Air; He to his Strings his tow'ring Voice cou'd raise, And on his Gittern thrum Harmonious Lays; No publick Inn, no Tavern in the Town, Where He, and where his Fiddle were not known; The merry Maids without him knew no Bliss, They took a License from his Strings to Kiss. Our Jolly Absolon, thus brisk and gay, Went with his Censer on a Sabbath-Day, To fume the Parish-Wives with pious Haste, And on them many a Holy Leer he cast. But when fair Alison he view'd, each Glance Made his Heart caper, and his Spirits dance; The Votary did more devoutly look Upon her Heav'nly Eyes, than on his Book: To Her he bow'd, unmindful of the Altar, And on her Face repeats his Lady's Psalter; Before her Beauties Shrine devoutly whispers His Mattins o're, and darkling sings his Vespers. Her Lovely Form so gratify'd the Sense, He cou'd not keep his wand'ring Eyes from thence: Had now the Pow'rs of Jove's superior House Transform'd our Clergy-Spark, and City-Spouse Into a Mufty-Cat, and a Sultana-Mouse, The furry Orthodox had born away, In his rapacious Claws, the ravish'd Prey. This Absolon, o'recome with am'rous Care, Felt such insatiate Longings for the Fair, That for her Sake alone, he cou'd refuse (What rarely Parish-Clerk remits) his Dues: For tho' the Female-Off'rings were many, He out of Kindness wou'd not touch a Penny; But that Religion might obliging prove, He threw them in the Service—All for Love. The Day was past, at length approach'd the Night, Pale Cynthia glitter'd with her Silver Light; His trusty Gittern forth the Lover brings, And softly humming preludes to his Strings, Till his instructed Voice and Hand prepare In goodly Strains to Serenade the Fair: Along he trudg'd with thoughtful Love oppress'd, While Jealousy consum'd his throbbing Breast; He just before the Ladies Bow'r appear'd, When wakeful Chanticleer's first Crow was heard, Which rouz'd the slumb'ring Strings, they soon obey'd, And in an Eunuch-Voice he sung, and play'd, His mournful Lays in doleful Notes express A Canticle of Woe, and Lovers in Distress. SONG. [O my dear Lady! O my Lady dear!] O my dear Lady! O my Lady dear! From gentle Flock-bed rouze, and eke vouchsafe to hear, Your Paramour, whose Brains (by the same Token) Are like his Fiddle crackt, with Strings and Heart nigh broken. O pity a disast'rous Lover weeping, Who for You wakes all Night, while You are soundly sleeping. While thus he Sings, the Carpenter awoke, And jogging Alison, thus gently spoke; “Hear'st Thou not how beneath our Bow'ry Wall “Absolon chaunts blythe Notes, and Quavers small! As scarce awake She yawn'd, and answer'd Gaping, “God wot I hear,—but little mind his Scraping. Day after Day he courts the scornful Dame, Who slights his Passion, and neglects his Flame; His am'rous Cares each Hour augmented so,— The Love-sick Wretch was quite begon with Woe; Pleas'd with his Pains, he sooths the fond Disease, And try'd all Methods, Lovers take, to please. He sleeks, careens, perfumes, and dresses high, Affects soft Airs, and gambols in her Eye; Now bribes some trusty Female Friend to try her, And Billet-Doux imparts his am'rous Fire, Righteously scrawl'd with many a Scripture-Portion, To shew how much he was—at her Devotion. For Her he dainty Cates, and Viands got, Flawns, Custards, Cakes, and Wafers piping hot, And (for he knew the Dame was nicely bred) He sent her fragrant Hydromel, and Mead; For well he deem'd some Nymphs, not over-chaste, By Courtly Presents are subdu'd at last: The heedless Sex too easily believe, And Men by various Stratagems deceive: The Young and Vain cheap glitt'ring Toys approve, Some flatter'd are, some bully'd into Love; But all his Skill can no Relief impart, The Gentle Nich'las so possess'd her Heart. The Delphian God in vain his Songs inspire, His Master-Hand no more provokes the Lyre, His Midnight Toils with no Reward are crown'd, His slighted Gifts are unsuccessful found: Th' Ungrate repays his Flames with cold Disdain, Smiles at his Torments, and neglects his Pain, With sportive Scorn insults her humble Slave, And ridicules him for the Wounds She gave. Now when one Saturday Uxorious John On urgent Bus'ness was to Os'ney gone, The Scholar with the Wife in Counsel join'd, Disclos'd the Project, which he had design'd; Where 'twas concluded, if the Game went right, Nich'las shou'd solace in her Arms all Night; T' effect the Plot, they both their Wits employ, Both equally impatient to enjoy. Then to his Room he secretly conveys Provisions to subsist him for Two Days; Bidding her tell the Property, in Case He ask'd for Him, She knew not where he was, Nor had She all the Day beheld his Face; And that She fear'd some Accident befel The moody Scholar, or he was not well; Since nor the Maid, nor She her self cou'd make, With all their Art, the Gentle Nich'las speak. In close Retirement thus he pass'd away, Like some Recluse, the melancholy Day, There eat, and slept till Sunday-Night came on, And Light departed with the Setting-Sun. The good old Carpenter with much Surprize, And senseless Wonder, turn'd up both his Eyes, Then wisely shook his Noddle sage, and said, “Pray Heav'n he be not suddenly fall'n dead. “Ah! Benedicite by this good Light, “I fear—much fear that all Things go not right. “Book-Learning is, no doubt, a mighty Pain, “The Night-Sweat, and Day-Labour of the Brain, “Poring brings Scholars many a grievous Ill; “An Apoplexy—and a Book may kill. “Life is uncertain too, and full of Sorrow; “We're in our Shops To-Day, and Graves To-Morrow. “Lately I saw a Neighbour work full hard, “Who now rests from his Toils—in our Church-yard: “Bankrupt of Life, I saw him, Trade forsaking, “Extended on a Bier of his own Making. The Preachment done, he call'd in furious Fashion, A Trusty 'Squire to make an Application. Up to the Scholar's Room he flew in haste, And jumbl'd at the Door—but found all fast: Again he storm'd it with a boist'rous Force, There bawl'd, and hallow'd till the Slave grew hoarse, “What hoa! why Master Nicholas, I say, “What! will you doze thus all the live-long Day? But, tho' he thunder'd, till he shook the Room, With trusty Nich'las not a Word—but Mum. Below he spy'd a Port-hole wide and large, Thro' which the stern Grimalkin us'd to charge Pickeering Parties of the Vermin-Kind, With whom he many a bloody Battel join'd; There he saw Nich'las sit, with Looks intent, Gaping, and staring tow'rds the Firmament, As if he was examining the Moon For Napkin gone astray, or Silver Spoon, Resolv'd to bring the Planets to Confession, For Culprit Mortal's, not their own Transgression. Surpriz'd at this unusual Sight, the Man Down Stairs agast unto his Master ran, Ready to break his Neck with eager Haste, To tell what he had seen, and what had pass't, And gave a full and punctual Relation Of the Result—of his Negotiation. The strange disast'rous News his Servant brought Roll'd in his Mind, and hung upon his Thought; At which both Hands across his Breast he laid, “Defend us good Saint Frideswide, he said; “We're foil'd by Providence, nor can we know “What shall befal our Pilgrimage below. “Astrology, with Notions wild and vain, “Has made him giddy, and quite turn'd his Brain. “'Tis a presumptuous daring Crime to pry “Into the Counsels of the Deity. “Unlearn'd my self, I still this Truth profess't, “Most Happy they that understand the least, “Who in Religious Offices advance “By an obedient, pious Ignorance, “And wisely in the beaten Path proceed, “Nor rashly venture on beyond their Creed; “Thro' winding Labyrinths we blindly stray, “And in the wand'ring Maze of Knowledge lose our Way. “A like Mischance befel, if Fame don't lye, “A Brother Student in Astrology. “As He was saunt'ring out one Star-light Even, “To view the Revolution-State of Heav'n, “And poring thro' his Necromantick Glass, “To see what, he ne're thought shou'd come to pass: “Into a Pit he fell.—Nor He, nor all “His trusty Planets cou'd foresee his Fall: “Alas! he saw not that.—And thus we find, “Tho' Heav'n may wink, Astrologers are blind. “But yet exceedingly I rue the Case, “And sore Mischance of Gentle Nicholas; “He must be waken'd, on this sad Occasion, “From Musing deep, and death-like Contemplation; “If ought my Strength or Cunning can prevail, “If well-known Spells, and Amulets don't fail. With that he call'd his Knave up from below, And bid him bring along an Iron-Crow, Which forcibly the brawny Rustick thrust Between the yawning Door, and sturdy Post, And with Three thund'ring Heaves the shatter'd Door, Born from its Hinges, flew into the Floor. But Nich'las well appriz'd, in sullen State, Stiff, without Motion, like a Statue, sat. His stony Eyes with wild Amazement stare, And upward still he gap'd into the Air. The Carpenter advanc'd and shook him hard, The more he shook, the more he gap'd, and star'd; Then piteously he yell'd, and in his Ear Sent hideous Screams;—but Nick refus'd to hear: Then first to Exorcise the Room he falls, Crossing the Door, the Threshold and the Walls, And after mumbl'd o're in baleful Tone The dreary Night-Spell thrice, which thus goes on: “From Fairy Elves, and Church-yard Sprights, “That walk their Ghostly Rounds a-nights, “From the deaf Adder's forked Sting, “And the Night-Raven's sooty Wing, “From that seducing wand'ring Fire, “That Peasant leads thro' Dirt and Mire, “The Night-Mare that on Mortal gets, “And rides him till he groans, and sweats; “Saint Benedict defend this Room; “Nor let the foul Fiend hither come. Thus, after he had charm'd, and shook him long, He by degrees began to use his Tongue; Then with a Groan his Words a Passage found, “And shall (says he) eftsoons the World be drown'd? The Carpenter cry'd, Well-a-day! Alas! “What is it you forebode must come to pass! “Ah! think on God—to Heav'n thy Pray'rs address, “Like poor Mechanick Mortals in Distress. “Fetch me (said he)—again my Spirits fall; “Fetch me—a potent Mug of humming Ale; “And afterward in private thou shalt hear “What much concerns us both—but first produce the Beer. Of mighty Ale he brought a Double Quart, And after each had swallow'd down his Part, The Scholar rais'd the Door, and made it fast, And at his Side the Carpenter he plac'd. “Now John, my kindest Host, and Landlord dear, “Thou on the Gospel of thy Faith shalt swear, “To living Wight thou never wilt betray “The Tenor of the Words I now shall say: “For know the Secrets I impart to thee, “Were first by Gracious Heav'n reveal'd to me; “Distraction shall ensue, if I'm betray'd, “And Frenzy seize on thy perfidious Head. Sage John rejoin'd, “You do me mighty wrong, “Thus to suspect me lavish of my Tongue; “I am no Cask, in which the Waters sink, “And loosely flow thro' ev'ry leaky Chink; “I'll not disclose on Forfeit of my Life, “Not ev'n to Alison my dearest Wife. Quoth Nich'las then—and paus'd as at a Stand, And with a friendly Pressure grasp'd his Hand; “To thee, and thee alone, I will declare “The secret Sentiments of ev'ry Star. “As lately I the various Moon beheld, “'Twas there by my Astrology reveal'd, “(Directed by her kind, auspicious Light) “That upon Monday next, at Quarter-night, “Rains shall descend too fierce to be withstood, “And greater far than those of Noah's Flood; “The delug'd Globe shall sink within an Hour, “The Storm so great, so terrible the Show'r, “Mankind shall perish in the boist'rous Tide. “Alas! my Wife!—(the Carpenter reply'd.) “Shall She be drown'd?—Alas! mine Alison! Then almost sunk with Grief into a Swoon; “Is there no Remedy in this sad Case? “Yes, yes, full good (quoth Gentle Nicholas) “If thou wilt steer by Solomon's Advice, “And cheaply grow, by other's Counsels, wise. “Hast thou not been instructed, how of old “The General Flood to Noah was foretold? “How he, by secret Revelation, found “Mankind must perish, and the World be drown'd! “What wily Projects fill'd his thoughtful Head, “To save the beauteous Consort of his Bed! “He at this Nick much rather wou'd incline “The Patriarchal Grandeur to resign “Of all his fleecy Ewes, and all his milky Kine, “Than not to have procur'd a single Ship, “To waft her safely o're the rolling Deep. “Therefore, without more Ceremony, go, “And instantly get ready for us Two “And Alison, three Kneading-Troughs, so large, “That we may ride secure as in a Barge; “Then, after that, proportionably get “Provisions good of Liquids, and of Meat, “To victual for a Day the little Fleet: “The Waters shall abate, and ebb away, “About the Prime upon th' ensuing Day. “But ah! beware that not a Word be said “Or to thy Knave, or Gillian the Maid, “Both doom'd to die;—no kind Reprieve is giv'n, “Such is the Sentence, such the Will of Heav'n! “Ask me not why—You but in vain require, “I may not gratify thy fond Desire; “As often as you ask, I will deny, “Nor once divulge the Secrets of the Sky: “Suffice it, that thy Grandsire Noah's Fate “Successfully shall on thy Fortunes wait, “Thou shalt enjoy the wat'ry Globe alone, “The boundless Riches of the World thine own. “As for thy Wife—take thou no further Care, “The Stars determine to preserve the Fair. “Now when thou hast perform'd what I have said, “And all my Precepts punctually obey'd, “(Hanging the Vessels in the Roof so high, “As scarce to be discern'd by Mortal Eye) “And carefully in ev'ry Wherry stor'd “A trusty Ax to cut th' impending Cord; “Next I enjoin thee, hew a Passage wide “In Front of thy fair Mansion, and provide “To back th' unruly Waves, and stem the boist'rous Tide. “Thus shall the floating Navy glide away, “As from the Dock, and launch into the Sea. “Then merrily we'll scud (I undertake) “As the white Duck, when she pursues the Drake. “Now will I call—hoa Alison!—hoa John! “Chear y' my Hearts—the Flood will pass anon. “But on that Night, when we the Vessels board, “All must be silent, and not speak a Word, “But secretly to Heav'n our Pray'rs address, “And importune the Gods for our Success. “Once more,—and then I have discharg'd my Heart, “Thou, and thy Wife must distant swing apart, “Least any impious, foul Offence arise “From Touch obscene, lewd Thoughts, or wanton Eyes. Th' Instructions giv'n, away the Husband went, His Soul distracted, full of Discontent, And to his Wife discover'd all, which She Was conscious of, and better knew than He: But yet pretending well-dissembl'd Fear, She beat her faithless Breast, and tore her Hair; True Sex all o're,—the Nymph began to cry, “Ah! do not let thy faithful Turtle die; “Preserve thy Alison,—O save my Life! “I am thy true, thy very wedded Wife. Affection can th' External Senses blind, And stamps such deep Impressions on the Mind, Th' Imagination is so strongly wrought, With Fancy we grow sick, and ev'n expire with Thought. Hence Visionary Floods his Soul molest, And roll and tumble in his troubl'd Breast; He thinks he sees mad Waves insult the Shore, And hears the loud tempestuous Billows roar, Then many a Tear he sheds, and inly groans, Sighs to the Winds, and sends forth bitter Moans, For Fear the rolling Deluge shou'd destroy The darling Consort of his Nuptial Joy. Under a Colour, and a Sham Pretence, Of weighty Bus'ness, and of Consequence, The Prentice and the Maid (not well aware on't) Were sent to London on an April-Errand. At length th' appointed Monday-Night was come, The Doors fast shut, no Taper in the Room, All Things adjusted as they ought to be, The Ladders fixt,—and up they climb'd all Three. First Nich'las stalk'd; then gravely mounted John; With nimble Strides next tript Fair Alison: There the good Husband sat with list'ning Ears, At his Devotion, mutt'ring o're his Pray'rs, Bidding his Beads from Peril to defend, Expecting still to hear the Rains descend. In Death-like Sleep the Carpenter soon lay, Fatigu'd with toilsom Labours of the Day; Much about Curfew-time, or little more, His troubl'd Ghost in Travail groan'd full sore, His Head mis-laid upon the naked Board, Made him uneasy, and he soundly snor'd: Which fairly seem'd the friendly Husband's Cue, T' instruct the Lovers what they ought to do. When Gentle Nicholas perceiv'd him fast, Down by the Ladder he descends in Haste; Then Alison full softly after sped, And both sans Ceremony went to Bed. What wanton Revellings! what am'rous Feats Were play'd between the Matrimonial Sheets! What breathless Extasies! what dying Charms! And how they curl'd in one another's Arms! In melting Pastime, Solace, and Delight, They pass'd the pleasing Hours, and entertain'd the Night; Till ev'n the Bell of Lauds began to ring, And Friars to the Chancells went to sing. The Parish-Clerk, the am'rous Absolon, With vain Fantastick Love so wo begon, To Os'ney-Abby on the Monday went, Where he his Hours in anxious Pleasure spent; Of a Monastick privately he sought If there the Carpenter had lately wrought: The Brotherhood reply'd—“His Ghostly Beard “Has not since Saturday to us appear'd; “Or to the Graunge, our Abbot sends from thence, “To get Church-Timber and Cathedral-Pence, “Where frequently the Wight's empow'rd to go, “And often tarries there a Day or two; “Or saunt'ring in his Shop, he spends the Day, “But where he plies, in sooth I cannot say. This Paramour full jocund grew and light, And thus bethought himself—“I, in Despite “Of Jealousy, will kiss fair Alison this Night: “I'm confident Old Grey-beard has not stirr'd “About his Door, since Morning first appear'd; “So may I thrive, at Crowing of the Cock “I'll at her Chamber-Window softly knock, “'Till the fair Dame, in Pity from above, “Shall mourn the Story of my fruitless Love; “Howe're severe my Fate, I cannot miss “The Civil Favour of a welcome Kiss; “Surely I shall some Comfort bear away, “My Lips have itch'd so merrily all Day. Now when shrill Chanticleer first crow'd, anon Up rose the Jolly Lover Absolon; His Courtly Dress adjusted was, and nice With Trappings gay, and many a quaint Device; And to put on a more surprizing Air, He tiff'd his Locks, and jessamin'd his Hair, Sweet fragrant Seeds, and perfum'd Pastills eat, To seem more gracious, and to breath more sweet. Thus in his gawdy Trim he took his Road To the good Carpenter's desir'd Abode, The Casement beat with many a Gentle Stroke, And as his busy Knuckle play'd, he spoke: “My Honycomb—my Fair—my Breath of Spice, “Dear of all Dears—sweet Bird of Paradise, “Awake—and to thy faithful Lover speak, “Who sighs for Grief, with Woe whose Heart-strings break. “You disregard the Suff'rings which I bear, “Unmindful to reward my am'rous Care; “Wounded with Love, and bleeding with Disdain, “I faint, and stagger underneath the Pain; “I for thy Beauties pant, desire, and burn, “Like Infant-Lambs that for the Nipple mourn; “All Night I weep, lament my doleful State, “The Turtle true ne're mourn'd so for her Mate; “Listless of Food, I like fond Virgins prove, “That will admit no Nourishment—but Love. “Away—be gone—Jack Fool—be gone—away, “If this is all your Clerkship has to say; “So help me Heav'n and sweet St. James (says She) “I love another better far than thee. “Mortal, Avaunt—(She cry'd)—no more molest “My softer Dreams, nor interrupt my Rest; “A Score of Devils seize thee;—prithee keep “No longer whining here—but let me sleep. “Unhappy Youth, ungrateful Nymph (he said) “Are thus my Suff'rings in the Ballance weigh'd? “Never was faithful Love so shamefully repaid: “Since 'twill no better be—yet grant me this, “Vouchsafe the Favour of a single Kiss. “If so, wilt thou contentedly be gone? “Upon thy Lips I'll swear (quoth Absolon.) “Prepare to Kiss the Book—I come anon. Then whisp'ring Nicholas, She cry'd, “Lie still; “Of mirthful Laughter thou shalt have thy Fill. Down on his Marrow-bones he falls, and there To Love's propitious Pow'rs directs his Pray'r, And Thanks returning, silently confess'd “No Lord so happy, and no King so bless'd; “This Pledge may prove an Earnest of a Sum “Of Endless Wealth, and Golden Joys to come. The Casement then Sh' unloos'd with eager Haste; “Quickly (says She) dispatch, and speed thee fast, “For fear our envious Neighbours shou'd prove Spies, “And then they will have Tongues as well as Eyes. With fresh Perfumes his Mouth he then supply'd, First lightly brush'd his Lips, and then more nicely dry'd. Blind was the Night, and black as Pitch or Cole, When fair and soft She to the Window stole, And thro' the Casement jutted out behind Her Nether Countenance with Cheeks as blind; Where Absolon close buckling to the Matter, Kiss'd her full sav'rily—'twixt Wind and Water. At first he started back, surpriz'd with Fear, Something he felt bush'd o're with curling Hair, Monstrously rough, and shaggy as a Bear; On second Thoughts his Error soon appear'd, He well consider'd Woman wore no Beard; Whence he profoundly guess'd, he might accost The Fair One in Reverse—and kiss—à Parte post. Fretting he scrubs to wipe away the Savour Of Olid Salts, and Ammoniack Flavour. He spit—he sputter'd—made a foul ado; “Te-He (quoth She) and clapt the Window too. Wrathful away he stalk'd a sullen Pace, Wild with his Wrongs, impatient of Disgrace, Distracted when his Rival's Voice he heard Insulting cry within—“A Beard! a Beard! He bit his Lips between his Teeth, like Food He ground the Flesh, and churn'd the frothy Blood. Resentment now had cool'd his warm Desire, No more he glows with Love's impetuous Fire; The Fever in his Blood no longer burns, The Brand extinguish'd, into Aches turns. Averse to Love, he shuns the hateful Cause Of Paramours, and disavows their Laws: This Backward Kiss had eas'd his Love-sick Heart, Reliev'd the Malady, and cur'd the Smart: Love and the faithless Sex he now defy'd, And sobbing, like a School-Boy flogg'd, he cry'd; “Alas! (said he) that I shou'd be so blind, “Not to consider, fickle Womankind, “Like Weather-Cocks, are light, and veering with the Wind. “Down will I go to Satan's Darksom Cell, “Thence will I fetch Revenge, if there's Revenge in Hell. It happen'd, as he Ruminating stood, An early Vulcan in the Neighbourhood Ply'd at his Forge,—across the Street he went, And quickly reach'd the smoky Tenement; He, forming Plough-shares, on the Anvil beat, Mid-day Repast to earn by Morning-Sweat; At Gervase's he knock'd, who answer'd strait; One open'd, and one stooping pass'd the Gate. “Friend Absolon, what makes you up so soon? “Hast thou been Catterwawling by the Moon? “Some bonny Lass (I trow) or Damsel bright “Has to thy wanton Fiddle danc'd all Night. Busy in Thought, revolving oft his Wrong, His stifl'd Words within ne're reach'd his Tongue: He from the Distaff had more Flax to draw Of finer Thread than what good Gervase saw: Moody he frown'd, refus'd to tell his Case, But ask'd the Culter for a little Space, That sparkl'd in the Forge, a glowing Mass. Quoth Smutty-Face, “To gratify a Friend, “I wou'd not, tho' 'twas Gold, refuse to lend; “But—prithee say—on what Design you borrow: “Ask me not now,—I'll tell thee more To Morrow. Pleas'd with the Grant, his eager Gripe laid hold Fast on the Culter, where the Steel was cold, Then with impatient Strides began to steal Tow'rds Antique John's more aged Citadel. Thither arriv'd, he nimbly patter'd o're The rattling Casement, as he did before; But first he cough'd, and hem'd,—sure Signs to know When an impatient Lover waits below. She heard, and hearing thus her self express't; “What Vagabond that thus disturbs my Rest? “Some Midnight Robber sent on vile Design, “Feloniously attempting to purloin “My Husband's best Commodities—his Wife, and Coyn. Soft he reply'd—“'Tis I—and I alone. “You!—who are You?—I am thine Absolon: “I here present thee with a precious Thing, “My Mother's Gift, a fair Enamel'd Ring “Of well-wrought Gold—I'll freely give thee this, “And give it only for another Kiss. Nich'las was from the tumbl'd Blankets got, From using of the Wife, to use the Pot; And to promote the Jest, and mend the Story, Swore he shou'd kiss him—à Posteriori; Then up he climbs, and thro' the Window launches His mounted Cannon-bore quite to the Haunches. Quoth Absolon,—“My precious Sweet, my Heart, “Speak, Dearest, speak; I know not where thou art. Nich'las full-charg'd, in loud Return let fly A Bomb, that burst like Thunder from the Sky; The Sulph'rous Exhalation from behind, Blasted the Sight, and almost struck him blind; The other stood prepar'd with Iron hot, And Nich'las on the Fundamentals smote. Off goes the Skin a full Hand's Breadth, or more, The Patient with the Blow tormented sore, For Anguish of the Smart began to roar; Furious he rag'd, confounded at the Matter, “Help—Water, loud he cry'd,—“Help—Water, Water. The Husband starting from his Slumber rose, And in Confusion quitted his Repose; Now comes the Flood, thought he,—sans more ado He snatch'd his Ax, and cut the Cord a-two. Descending—down he fell;—and tumbling down, Lay breathless on the Pavement in a Swoon; The Lovers start from their polluted Sheets, And yelling Murder cry about the Streets. In Flocks the Neighbours scamper'd far and near; With stupid Eyes, and gaping Wonder stare Upon the poor deluded Carpenter. Men, Women, Dogs, and Boys together ran, And stood agast to see him look so wan; Scholars and Cits—the Wise and the Wisacres, Wives with their Cuckolds, and their Cuckoldmakers. So sore the Fall, that in Precipitation Some Bones were broke, some suffer'd Dislocation; In vain he pleaded in his own Defence, The Wife and Scholar form'd some sham Pretence, And jointly ran him down with frontless Impudence; Bant'ring the Neighbours that around him stood, He entertain'd such Whims of Noah's Flood, Notions so wild, fantastick, and so vain They made him frantick, and had crack'd his Brain. For this Three Kneading-Troughs aloft he hung, For this all Night aloft he dangling swung, And by Intreaties long prevail'd, that we Wou'd kindly Sit with him for Company. Upward they gape into the Roof, and there Espy Two Vessels waving in the Air. Soon the Sagacious Mob his Foible found, They sneer'd in Consort, and the Laugh went round; They laugh'd the more, the more he did protest, And lightly turn'd his Earnest into Jest: The sober Plea, his Reason offer'd, went For Bedlam-Proof, and Moorfield Argument: In Ridicule Confed'rate Scholars join, For well they smok'd the Jocular Design; Brother to Brother's bound by mutual Laws, There's Party Laugh, as well as Party-Cause. Hence in a Moment was the Story known, And he a Madman deem'd thro' all the Town. Thus Nich'las all Night clasp'd the wanton Dame, And the Good Wife had Plenty of that Same; Spruce Absolon was bilkt of his Desire, One Jilted was, and One felt Ordeal Fire. Night made our Vocal Sternhold misapply, And Kiss prepost'rously her Nether Eye. The Gown's-Man he his Clergy claim'd, and so Was only branded on the Cheek below. As for the Clerk I leave him to resent, The injur'd Husband to his Discontent, The Philomath and Wife for ever to repent. Imitated from a Little Book, Entitl'd, POETÆ Rusticantis Literatum Otium. The Power of LOVE. Enough my am'rous Muse has play'd, And sweetly sung the Gentle Maid; Gentle Lycoris, fair and young, Enough has grac'd my am'rous Song. Upon her Cheeks, upon her Breasts, Cupid in Down, and Roses rests; On rosy Beds, in wanton Play, Frolicks all Night, and sports all Day. Sufficiently I've sung the Fair, Her cruel Eyes, and mazy Hair, Her Eyes that burn with Rage Divine, That so unmercifully shine, They kill this tender Heart of mine. But Love no more my Breast alarms; Now let us sound To Arms! To Arms! Let the Drums beat a Martial Strain, While Echo's rattle o're the Plain; Bid Trumpets rouze the Warrior-God With Fury chaf'd, and bath'd in Blood: Who, when the thund'ring War is done, With Laurels crown'd, in Battel won, Retreats in eager Haste, to sport With Venus in the Cyprian Court. On her his Head reclining throws, And in her Bosom seeks Repose, Where with a balmy Kiss, and Smile She heals his Wounds, rewards his Toil. He now does Thousand Kisses taste, And, after Thousand Kisses past, Transporting Joys the Lover meet, Joys more than Heav'nly Nectar sweet. Fantastick Muse, where dost thou stray? Whither mislead me from my Way? E're while I did my Strings prepare, To sound the Noise, and Pomp of War; But ah! in spite of all my Art, Victorious Love resumes my Heart. Fair Venus does my Thoughts employ, Fair Venus, and her Quiver'd Boy; These Gentle Pow'rs my humble Vein improve, They bid me Sing, and all I Sing is Love. Hersilia chang'd into the Goddess ORA. From the 20th Fable of the XIVth Book of Ovid's Metamorphosis, Beginning thus: Flebat ut amissum Conjux, &amp;c. When Royal Juno heard Hersilia moan, Since the Dear Lord of all her Vows was gone, She Iris sent her swift Commands to bear, And comfort with these Words the mourning Fair. ‘O Thou the Glory, and unequal'd Grace ‘Of all the Roman, and thy Sabine Race, ‘Worthy your Hero, whilst He here abode, ‘As worthy of him now, tho' made a God; ‘No more lament, no more indulge your Cares, ‘But with those Sighs suppress your flowing Tears. ‘If you'd behold the Form you so much love, ‘Approach with me that Hill, and Sacred Grove ‘That does thy Romulus his Temple grace, ‘And spreads a Reverend Shade around the Hallow'd Place. Streight Iris by her painted Bow descends, Pleas'd to obey her Goddess's Commands. The Charge receiv'd, Hersilia's Blushes rise, And gently raising her unwilling Eyes, Says She, O Goddess (for thro' all your Frame A Goddess shines, tho' it conceals your Name,) Direct my Steps, your promis'd Aid afford, And O! conduct me to my Dearest Lord; Let but the Glory of his Eyes appear, You give me Heav'n, for all my Heav'n is there. Transported with her faithful Guide She pass'd, And panting, climbs the Hill wirh eager Haste. Shot from its Sphere, a Meteor downward fled, Gilding her flaming Hair with Beams, that spread A Glory round her Consecrated Head: Her Grosser Parts refin'd, to Heav'n aspire, And with her Guardian-Star She mounts in Fire. Rome's Founder, yet Uxorious, feels Love's Flame, And Clasping in his Arms the Royal Dame, At once he chang'd her Body, and her Name. Now Ora call'd, a Goddess She remains, And by Quirinus blest, with him She jointly reigns. Advice to the Philosophers. Hither, dull Stoicks, leave the dry Amusements of Philosophy; Forsake your Cells, and sober Rules, You wretched, antiquated Fools: Leave, leave your Grave, Elab'rate Toys, For Dotards fit, and Bearded Boys; No more th' instructive Grape despise, Drink, and endeavour to grow wise. You, who old musty Systems read, And study—to purloin the Dead, That still new Dunces to commence, Pore out the Eyes to grope for Sense, And wear the precious Hours away, To wake all Night, and dream all Day; Yet, after all, can scarce prevail To furnish out a sorry Tale, Idle as that Old Nurses use, When they their wayward Babes amuse; When close they hug 'em to the Breast, And lull th' impatient Fools to Rest. Dull Stoicks, You'll ne're thus obtain The Truth, you long have sought in vain, With so much Labour, so much Pain. Away with such Delusive Dreams; Come bathe in sprightly Bacchus Streams. Empty the Flasks, the Glasses drain, Exhaust the Bowls, then fill again; Again attempt th' inviting Flood, And take in all the flowing God. Thus, thus, my Converts, you'll obtain The Truth, you long have sought in vain, With so much Labour, so much Pain. The British Heroes: OR, A New BALLAD in Honour of St. GEORGE, &amp;c. By Mr. JOHN GRUBB, late of Christ-Church, OXON. Favete linguis: Carmina non prius Audita, Musarum Sacerdos, ?Canto. Hor. I. The Story of King Arthur Old A right Noble, Valorous Prince, and a Bold Britain. He is Famous for Keeping a Good Round Table for Himself, and his Knights. Tho' our Hudibras seems to be of a different Opinion: ? Arthur wore in Hall Round Table like a Farthingal; On which, with Shirt pull'd out behind, And eke before, his Good Knights din'd. Tho' 'twas no Table, some suppose, But a huge Pair of round Trunk Hose. Hud. Is very memorable, For Number of his Valiant Knights, And Roundness of his Table: His Knights in Circle round it sat, As round, as round might be, And all together made up one Large Hoop of Chivalry. He had a Sword both large and sharp, Ycleped Calibourn, 'Twould cut a Flint more easily Than Penknife pares a Corn. As Roman Augur's Steel of Yore His Name was Actius Nævius; who shew'd his Tricks of Legerdemain before Tarquinius Priscus. He was a Notable Shaver, and had an Enchanted Razor; and, by all Accounts, was the first that dissected Whetstones. Dissected Tarquin's Riddle, So this would cut both Conjurer, And Whetstone in the Middle. He was the Cream of Brecknock, And Flow'r of all the Welch: But Good St. George the Dragon fell'd, And gav' him a plaguy Squelch. St. George he was for England, St. Dennis was for France, Sing Honi Soit qui Mal y pense. II. Tamerlane with Tartarian Bow A Scythian Prince that brought down the High Stomach of Bajazet, that Insolent Emperor of the Turks. He kept him in a Cage, fed him with Hemp-feed and Water; whence 'tis fabl'd he sung but a Sorrowful Ditty. The Turkish Squadrons slew, And fetch'd the Pagan Crescent down, With Half-Moon made of Yew. His trusty Bow proud Turks did gall With Show'rs of Arrows thick; And Bow-strings, without Strangling, sent Grand-Viziers to Old Nick. He coop't in Cage grim Bajazet, Prop of Mahown's Religion, So I think he is wrote by Fairfax, in his Translation of Tasso. As most Notorious Cheats do, he goes by various Appellations—I do not find any Arabian, or Turkish Historian, make any Mention of his Christian Name. As if't had been the whisp'ring Bird This same Mahomet kept a tame Pigeon, that he brought up to peck out of his Ear. This Bird he pretended was the Courier that brought him his Letters of Inspiration. That prompted him, the Pigeon. In Turky-Leather Scabbard he Did sheath his Blade so Trenchant, But George he swing'd the Dragon's Tail, And cut off ev'ry Inch on't. St. George, &amp;c. III. He was the Son of Thetis, a Goddess of the Sea. Tho' some Authors tell you, She was no more than the Retailer of an Oyster-Tub, and in Days of Yore cry'd Thames Flounders. Achilles of Old Chiron learn'd A Centaur, which is a promiscuous Creature, made up of a Man and an Horse. He could kick, and cuff, go, and sit still, and (for ought I know) discourse, and neigh at the same time. Our Author says, He taught Achilles to Ride the Great Horse; and 'tis very likely that his Pupil (like most Young Gentlemen) sometimes Rode him. The Great Horse for to ride, Taught by the Centaurs Rational Part Th' Hinnible to bestride. Bright Silver Feet, and shining Face This is from Homer, I am told, who was the first that Lampoon'd the Grecian Heroes, and Jack-Boots. I shall forbear to quote the Words in the Original, they being Heathen Greek, and consequently may be offensive to many a good, sober Christian's Eyes. Had the stout Hero's Mother; As Rapier's silver'd at one End, And wounds you with the other. Thetis to Two-fold Pedagogue Commits her tender Boy, Who bred him from a slender Twig To be the Scourge of Troy. He, e're he lash'd the Trojans, was In Stygian Water steep't, 'Tis fabl'd, that Achilles's Mother dipt him in Styx, a River of Hell; which made him invulnerable in all Parts, but his Pagan Heel. As Birchen Rod's first sok'd in Piss, When Boys are to be whipt. His Myrmidons robb'd Priam's Barns A People of Thessaly, who from Pismires were conjur'd into Men. In good sooth they were laborious Husbandmen, that thrash'd, often carry'd Eggs, and sometimes brought their Pigs to a Fair Market. And Hen-Roosts, says the Song, Carry'd away both Corn and Eggs, Like Ants, from whence they sprung. Himself tore Hector's Pantaloons, Son of Priamus, King of Troy; who was unmercifully drubb'd by Achilles, and then dragg'd shirtless round about the City. And sent him down bare-breech'd To Pedant Radamanthus, in One of the Judges of Hell. Tho' our Author seems to suggest, that he was a Low-Country School-Master. A Posture to be switch'd, But George he made the Dragon look As if h' had been bewitch'd. St. George, &amp;c. IV. The Amazon Thalestris was She was a Queen of the Amazons: They were North-Country Lasses, never marry'd, but kept their Gallants. And, because they were observ'd never to produce Twins, cut off one of their Breasts when young, &amp;c. Both beautiful and bold, She sear'd her Breasts with Iron hot, And bang'd her Foes with cold. Her Hand was like the Tool wherewith Jove keeps proud Mortals under, Like his with dreadful Flashes shone, And batter'd like his Thunder. Her Eyes dart Lightning, that would blast The proudest He that swagger'd, And melt the Rapier of his Soul In its Corporeal Scabbard. She kept the Chastness of a Nun, In Armour, as in Cloyster; But George undid the Dragon just As you'd undo an Oyster. St. George, &amp;c. V. Full fatal to the Romans was The Carthaginian Hanni- A Great General that slew so many Roman Knights at Cannæ, a little Village in Apulie. He always wink'd with one Eye, and was accounted an Excellent Marksman. A Sowre-look'd, Vinegar-fac'd Hero. bal, Him I mean, who gave to them That devilish Thump at Cannæ. Moors, thick as Goats on Penmenmore, Stood on the Alps's Front, Their one-ey'd Guide, like blinking Mole, Bor'd thro' th' opposing Mount; Who, baffl'd by the Massy Rock, Took Verjuice for Relief, Like Ploughmen, when they hew their Way Thro' stubborn Rump of Beef. As dancing Louts from humid Toes Cast Atoms of ill Savour, While Village Waits blink o're vile Crowd, And Merriment endeavour; Sawing from suff'ring Timber out A wretched Tune to quiver; So Romans stunk, and squeak'd at Sight Of African Conniver. The tawny Surface of his Phiz Did serve him for a Vizard; But George he made the Dragon have A Grumbling in his Gizzard. St. George, &amp;c. VI. Pendragon, like his Father Jove, Jupiter was suckl'd by a She-Goat, call'd Amalthæa; but the Name of Pendragon's Nurse is not to be found in the British Annals. Was fed with Milk of Goat, And in Return a Shield made of His shaggy Nurse's Coat. On Top of burnish'd Helmet he Did wear a Crest of Leeks, And Onion-Heads, whose dreadful Nod Drew Tears from Hostile Cheeks. Itch and Welch Blood did make him hot, And very prone to Ire, H' was ting'd with Brimstone like a Match, And would as soon take Fire. The Britain never tergivers'd, But was for adverse Drubbing, Nor ever turn'd his Back to ought, But to a Post for Scrubbing. He wounded, and in their own Blood Did Anabaptize Pagans; But George he made the Dragon an Example to all Dragons. St. George, &amp;c. VII. So hard-favour'd a Damsel, that she turn'd every thing she look'd upon into Stone. Gorgon a twisted Adder wore For Knot upon her Shoulder, She kemb'd her hissing Perewig, And Curling Snakes did powder. These Snakes they made stiff Changelings Of all Folks that they hiss't on, They transform'd Barbers into Hones, And Masons into Free-stone. The Post-diluvian Stones unmans, And Pyrrhus' Work unravels, Deucalion and Pyrrha, the only Two the Deluge could not wash away; These turn'd Stones into Men, as the Gorgon Men into Stones. And stares Deucalion's hardy Boys Into their Prim'tive Pebbles. She Noddles into Marble turns, That weeps at Change of Weather; But George the Dragon tore, as Heav'n And Earth wou'd come together. St. George, &amp;c. VIII. Brave Warwick-Guy, at Dinner-time, The Actions of this Great Champion you'll see at large, in the Famous History of Guy Earl of Warwick; a Book well worth your Reading. Challeng'd a Giant Savage, When strait came out unweildy Lout Brimful of Wrath and Cabbage: He had a Phiz of Latitude, And was full thick in th' Middle, The puff'd Cheeks of a Trumpeter, And Paunch of Squire-Beadle; These 'Squire-Beadles, in Days of Yore, were Persons of Distinction, and made a Great Figure in the University. But the Knight fell'd him like an Oak, And did upon his Back tread, The Valiant Guy his Weazon cut, And Atropos his Packthread. Besides he fought with a Dun Cow, As say the Poets witty, A dreadful Dun, and horned too, Like Dun of Oxford City. She vanquish'd many a sturdy Wight, And proud was of the Honour, Was puff'd by mauling Butchers so, As if themselves had blown her. At once she kick'd, and push'd at Guy, But all that would not fright him; Who wav'd his Whinniard o're Sir Loin, As if h' had gone to knight him. Then slew, and rear'd vast Crooked Rib, Instead of Arch Triumphal; But George the Dragon gave a Doust, Which made him on his Bum fall. St. George, &amp;c. IX. Great Hercules the Offspring was He was the Son of Hercules and Alcmena; a Monster-Drubber from his Cradle; where he strangl'd Two Dragons no less terrible than that of St. George, or the other of Wantly. Of Jove and Fair Alcmene, One Part of him Celestial was, The other Part Terrene: To Scale the Hero's Cradle-Walls Two fiery Snakes combin'd, And Curling into swadling Bands, About the Infant twin'd: The Boy undaunted heard them hiss, And e're he scarce had Rag on, Squeez'd out the Poyson Flames and Breath Of one—and th' other Dragon. He cleans'd a Stable, and rubb'd down The Horses of New-Comers, And out of Horse-Dung rais'd up Fame, As Gard'ner does Cu-cumbers. Our Hero was first Groom of the Stable to Augeas, King of Elis. He cleans'd it from Thirty Years Compost, by letting the River Alpheus Flow thro' it. Alpheus the liquid Ostler, he Appointed Under-Groom, The Streams disgust at Office mean, Went murm'ring thro' the Room. This Hercules as Soldier, and As Spinster could take pains; His Club would sometimes spin you Flax, And sometimes knock out Brains. Often he fought with huge Battoon, And oftentimes he boxed, Tapp'd a fresh Monster once a Week, As Drawer does fresh Hogshead. He gave Antæus a close Hug, A Huge Gyant, as big as either of those in Guild-Hall, and a Notable Wrestler, that rose the better for being thrown: As Tradesmen, and Bones are the stronger for being broken. As Wrestlers do in Cornwal; But George the Dragon knock'd o' th' Head, As dead as any Door-Nail. St. George, &amp;c. X. The Valour of Domitian One of the Roman Emperors, a Persecutor of Humble-Bees, and Christians. He first invented Cobweb-Nets, and Fly-flaps. Must never be forgotten, Who from the Jaws of blowing Flies Protected Veal and Mutton. A Squadron of Flies-Errant now Against the Foe appears, With Regiments of buzzing Knights, And Swarms of Volunteers. The Warlike Wasp encourag'd 'em With animating Hum, And the loud brazen Hornet was Instead of Kettle-Drum. The Spanish Don Cantharido Did him most sorely pester, And rais'd on Skin of Vent'rous Knight Full many a plaguy Blister. A Bee whipt thro' his Button-hole, As thro' Key-hole a Witch, And stabb'd him with a little Tuck, Drawn out of Scabbard-Breech. But the undaunted Knight lifts up An Arm both big and brawny, And slash'd her so, that here lay Head, And there lay Bag of Honey. Surviving Flies did Curses breathe, And Maggots too at Cæsar; But George he shav'd the Dragon's Beard, And Ask'lon was his Razor. St. George, &amp;c. XI. The Gemini sprung from an Egg, Twins, the Offspring of Jupiter and Læda. They were Bully-Backs to their Sister Helena, a famous Greek Courtezan. Which laid was in a Cradle, Their Brains with Knocks and Bottl'd Ale Were oftentimes full addle. Castor a Horseman, Pollux eke A Boxer was I wist, The one was fam'd for Iron Heel, Th' other for Leaden Fist. Pollux, to shew he was a God, When he was in a Passion, With Fist made Noses fall down flat By way of Adoration. As sure as French Disaster, he Demolish'd Noses Ridges, And, like a certain Lord, was fam'd Lord Lovelace, who at the Revolution broke down the Bridges at Oxford. For breaking down of Bridges. Castor's fam'd Horse that liv'd on Oats Is Sung on Oaten Quill, By Bard's immortal Provender The Nag surviveth still. This shelly Brood on none but Knaves Employ'd their brisk Artill'ry, Nat'rally flew at Rogues, as Eggs At Dan. de Foe in Pillory. Much Sweat they spent in furious Fight, Much Blood they did effund, Their Whites they vented thro' the Pores, Their Yolks thro' gaping Wound. Then both from Blood and Dust were clean'd, To make a Heav'nly Sign, The Lads were, like their Armour, scour'd, And then hung up to shine. Such were the Heav'nly Double Dicks, The Sons of Jove and Tindar; But George he cut the Dragon up, Like any Duck or Whindar. St. George, &amp;c. XII. By Boar-Spear Meleager ac- He slew a wild Boar. 'Tis story'd of him, that he was to live as long as a certain Billet remain'd unburn'd, which being thrown into the Fire, that and his Life expir'd together. He had an Inflammation in his Bowels, and dy'd of a burning Fever. quired a Lasting Name, And from the Haunch of basted Swine Hew'd out Eternal Fame. His tawny Hairs erected were By Rage that was resistless; And Wrath, instead of Cobler's Wax, Stiffen'd his rising Brist—les. His Tusks laid Dogs so dead asleep, Nor Whip nor Horn cou'd wake 'em; It made them vent both their last Blood, And their last Album Græcum. But the Knight gor'd him with his Spear, To make of him a tame one, And Arrows thick, instead of Cloves, He stuck in Monster's Gammon. For Monumental Pillar, that His Triumphs might be known, He rais'd up in Cylindrick Form A Collar of the Brawn. He sent his Shade to Shades below, In Stygian Mud to wallow; And eke the stout St. George est soon He made the Dragon follow. St. George he was for England, St. Dennis was for France, Sing Honi Soit qui Mal y pense. FINIS.</field>
