      <field name="fulltext">PART I. DEDICATION. The world grows older while I tend The light before thy shrine, But still the peaceful river runs Its course through realms of mine, And still the curtain falls at night, And still the stars do shine, And still the mountain streamlet sings To one for ever thine. THE SEA-SPELL. What says the placid ocean When the streamlet greets the sea? âRoom here, room here, my daughter, For as much as reaches me.â However far from home, Love, In whatsoever grave, There cannot fail me ministers Of the music that I crave; The rattle of the moorland stream, The murmur of the wave. The all-sufficient emblems Of Life and Love to me, My course is with the rivulet That speeds towards the sea. Is there a deeper love, Love, Than this that greeteth thee? DEMETER. The emblem of her station, Upon her forehead bound; The noblest woman-figure That Art has ever crowned:â Oh! Mother, Mother, Mother, Of the children crowding round, Does the love-song of thy lover In the dome o'erhead resound? The Song of Songs, no other, Ten Thousand voices found. WILLIAM MORRIS. Sweet Thames, flow softly as my tears flow. To Kelmscott Manor, this October morn, To rest beside thee is my master borne, And I of those who loved him, may not go. Because he sorrows best at home, they say, Who grieves in silence, leaving all unsaid, Because perhaps, since London gives him bread, He may not leave her, even for a day. They would have died to save him who have borne The brunt of this long battle with the foe; And they are with him:ânaught of empty show At Kelmscott Manor, this October morn. Oct. 6, 1896. SHADOWS. Bend we together, Husband and wife, O'er a child sleeping, Dearer than life. Say we together, Husband and wife, âThe painting will never Be true to the life.â Heavy the footfall, BatÃ¨d the breath, Quit we the chamber Held by Death. âSeek ye in marble,â The comforter saith, âThe semblance of living The silence of Death.â VOCES POPULI. Lay by him, since 'tis broken The staff he leanÃ¨d on, And this, the lover's token That lips have dwelt upon. 'Tis not the dead, the living, That this, ah this, must bear; Too late to be forgiving, Too soon to join him there. âMore sinned against than sinningâ:â âNo fault of his the painâ:â âThe poet's guerdon winningâ:â While tears fall like rain. Verses 2 and 3: v. infra, âThe Poet's Legacy,â p. 41. TRANSLATION. [On the high mountain range] On the high mountain range There is rest. Of wind Not a breath On its crest. In the forestâ Hush, hush, It is lateâ No call of the bird To his mate. LullÃ¨d to slumber, Folded to breast, âSoon,â saith our Mother, âThou too shalt rest.â TRANSLATION. [Where shall one all travel-weary] Where shall one all travel-weary Courting rest at last recline? In the South beneath the palm tree? Under lindens by the Rhine? Shall it be upon the desert Covered by a stranger's hand, Or on billows undulating Far from any Christian land? Onwards everâHeaven hanging Shrouds above me, there and here; While for torches, stars at midnight Overhead are burning clear. PRAYER FOR THE RACE. Mother of mothers, God grant to thee Strength that strength may be. One who unchangingly Loves and reveres, Penneth these words to thee, Blindly through tears. Tears that betoken not Weakness in strife, But fond irrepressible Tributes to life. Mother of mothers, God grant to thee Strength that strength may be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. MIDSUMMER. Ah! Love, I lack thy kisses In the warm sweet breath of June; I am lonely amid loversâ Love, come soon. A blue sea stretches waveless 'Neath a blue, blue sky this June; I am panting for thy love, Love, Love, come soon. EVENTIDE. The mazy path that I would tread, At nightfall by the pixies led, It leadeth to the no-man's land Where plighted, linkÃ¨d, lovers stand. Lips sealing lips, in silence they Give ear to what the heavens say:â The Evening Star to setting Sun: âThe day has half his course to run.â A LONDON IDYLL. A toiler here in London, Her brave face nothing shows; The head at work, the hand at work, The heartache comes and goes. The day's work done, the respite won, The word for all is Rest; Oh, where so safe the token Of love as on her breast? Let rest until the Morrow Its keeper, quit of care; The face that has its setting In coils of silken hair; The bosom rising, fallingâ Its secret hidden there. II. HER LETTERS. Too sweet, too sweet, they bridge the vast 'Twixt town and country, friend and friend. Too sweet, too sweet, for overcast By thought that thinking cannot mend. LINES FOR A PAINTING. Oh, Autumn leaves! Oh, what for wealth of auburn hair But Autumn leaves! See hope fulfilled in rangÃ¨d sheaves, See in dead nature love's despair, And truant Joy, and russet Care In Autumn leaves. LESLIE. Seeing me enter Crosses the floor:â Leslie is lovely, Sister and more. Putteth her face up Once to be kissed; What shall the word be? Love-in-a-mist! Now must she leave me, Crossing the floor:â Leslie is lovely, Sister and more. Fain to be with her, Loth to depart; Present or absent, Filling my heart. What should the word be, Here by the door? Leslie is lovely, Sister and more. TRANSLATION. [I hide from mankind only] I hide from mankind only What I have borne from thee, And toss it to the fishes, Love, While speeding o'er the sea. Upon the mainland only Has Gossip spared thy name. What do the waves but spread, Love, The story of thy shame? THE POET'S LEGACY. âThrough busiest street and loneliest glen Are felt the flashes of his pen; Deep in the general heart of men His power survives.â (Wordsworth on Burns.) Beloved and loving stood we two, Remote, unseen, unheard; The seal that lovers use was set On the unspoken word; And in the silence Time maintained While two hearts beat as one Was proof sufficient, failing speech, That he was loved or none. âTo-morrow thenâto-morrow thenâ Meet we again,â said he. The path I trod that evening Seemed, oh, so strange to me! My heart was beating, beating, Of I know not what afraid, Beneath the silent stars I fell Upon my knees, and prayed:â âOh! thou thrice blessed, bride of God, To whom the Christ was born; Thou who throughout the ages past The woman's crown hast wornâ The peaceful inward sense that has Its dwelling in thy frame; If that be love, what bodeth this? Oh, what should be its name?â Then spake in pity she who has The niche beside the road:â âIf love of equal worth has been, My child, on thee bestowed, Thou too art blessÃ¨d; she who speaks Has lived, and loved, and prayed.â Then lips with kisses burning were On feet of marble laid. Oh, that was life! The image now That he is dead and gone, Would have me read the riddle Of the river speeding on. 'Tis not the dead, the living, That this, ah! this, must bear; Too late to be forgiving, Too soon to join him there. âMore sinned against than sinningââ âNo fault of his the painââ âThe poet's guerdon winningââ While tears fall like rain. MEMORIES. Our kisses ere the day was done Were gathered slowly into one; There rose a star where sank the sun. The whole in keeping, love confessed, The silence of the crimsoned West, The roving spirit seeking rest. TRANSLATION. [My heart is troubled, and I think] My heart is troubled, and I think With longing of the olden time When under sunnier skies we dwelt, And life ran pleasantly as rhyme. But now is this all over-set, And all is strain and stress instead; No longer have we God above, Down under lies the Devil dead, And all is rotten, mean and vain, Sad, sullen, and of joy bereft; There were no halting place for Pain But that a little Love is left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. [If ever in the books of verse that claim] If ever in the books of verse that claim The prize that poets covet thou dost find But one pure song deserving of the name, Then with unstinted sudden kisses bind The writer to thee, daring him to say, While seeking ev'ry moment to prolong; While thy hands with the budding laurel play:â âWe learn in suff'ring what we teach in Song.â With apologies to P. B. Shelley. COMEDY. Maiden, there is pent in thee Wealth of mirth and melody That full oft amazes me. Th'flavour of the rarest wine Hath the tiniest geste of thine; Maiden, maiden, there are Nine Muses in thee tightly packed, Each with her own part to act; As we marvel at the fact, So we love thee, maiden mine. DIGNITY AND IMPUDENCE. After Heine. Gracious lady, wilt' allow Apollo's love-sick son to rest, So sweet is sleep, a poet's brow Upon thy swan-white breast? Now that's too bad! Are poets mad? What next, I wonder, would they do? Sir! this to me? In public, too! THE WHISPER AND THE KISS. After Heine. Ah, Love, the seagulls yonder, In circles drawing near, Are seeking to discover When thy lips touch my ear, What the low voice has murmured, And whence the thrill of bliss, And which has meant the most, Love, The whisper or the kiss? Best keep them circling round, Love, The centre that they miss, Where lost, as if for ever, Is the whisper in the kiss. Here the translation ends. âNot one without the other,â As if from some abyss, Say we, reposing sweetly Where Heaven, dearest, is. Oh, what if Gossip knew, Love, That custom sanctions this! THE AUTHOR'S LIBRARY. A Sonnet derailed. My comrades, tho' ye figure not in Lowndes, Manual of Bibliography. Thy costlier brethren long have lost their home, Shall ye be ravished from me, tome by tome, For fewer shillings than ye cost me pounds? Oh! when our breezy language knew no bounds, And when the mildest oath in use wasâZounds! The custom was for poets forced to roam To clear the mouth back-handed of its foam, Consign the dun to London's Ditch of Hounds, And then with certain red-hot playthings make The humbled Hebrew think it best to take, âPlease God and Holy Moses,â pence for pounds. Shades of unthrifty authors who are dead! Once, snugly harboured, dallying by turns With new and old, in such pure peace I read As he who, lacking nothing, idly learns, But now of poets all too widely spread, The chief are the song-masters: after Heine, Burns. AFTER HEINE. Friend, conciliate the Devil, Brief is here the course we run, And the Hell that we are promised, Is no fable pulpit-spun. Friend, discharge the debt thou owest; 'Tis a weary course we run, And you'll often have to borrow, As so often you have done. A PEN SKETCH. A little wife, a little wine, A little villa, spick and span, And looming large in the design, A cradle, and a little man. The emblem of the civic state He cast aside for lighter wear, And when replenished and elate, Caressed his little partner there. He had, when he had done with sleep, To scamp his little prayer, and shave. He might, who has such hours to keep, As well be trotting to his grave. His âFirmâ had all his little brains, His Chief was raised from Mammon's clay, He hoped, by never sparing pains, To have that promised Rise one day. And when he died of catching trains; â'Twas cutting it too close,â said they. To H. E. T. II. HOME FROM HOME. Where one finds silence understood, Where speech is golden grain, Where Faith and Hope and Charity, The maidens of thy train, Assembled at thy bidding have To smooth the bed of pain. The room and its appointments tell Of thy presiding care, The flowers that call thee mistress lend Their sweetness to the air. The heralds of the dawn who have Their white feet on the stair; The sign of silence they do make, The sleeper has their prayer. So dreameth he the poet's dream, A medley rich and rare, Of being lifted up and laid On beds of clover there. My friend, another wingÃ¨d thought The verse will hardly bear, Tho' denizens of Heaven have Their clouds of maiden-hair! Let others note the glint of gold In the white robes they wear, And show them yielding sapling-wise To every breath of air; For what but idle dreams are mine Of joys I cannot share? Nor peace nor rest in London isâ My soul is with thee there. LOVE AND DEATH. From Ãsop's Fables. Came Love, one summer day, Dead tired, so they say, Unto a grotto fair, And courted slumber there, And flung his darts away. Pitch dark, the Fable saith, And named the Cave of Death, But this Love did not know. As though he'd sped a shaft With more than common craft, Once in his sleep he laughed; At Dawn he rose to go, And a cry he did emit Of gladness to be quit Of the darkness, and the odour of the Cave. Departing he was fain To have his darts again:â âOh! Love, blind Love, beware! The shafts of Death are there, The shafts of Death are there,â Said the echo to the echo in the Cave. But Love cared not a stiver, Intent on human hearts, He gathered to his quiver His own with Death's black darts, And glorious as the morning He winged his golden way; Fair maidens had forewarning That Love was on the way. The strong man, labour scorning, Did nothing all that day, For dallying with a maiden Is neither work nor play. To Earth, to Earth again! Intending ill to none; He wotted not of pain, Blind creature of the Sun; Scarce knowing what he did, In haste to have it done, Both young and old he rushed amid And shot his arrows every one. Then some cried out:ââ'Tis Death he deals!â And surely Death did come; While others cried:ââ'Tis Love, 'tis Love!â And Love there was for some. TWO VOICES. Sweet, on thy lips a smile there played; A surface ripple that betrayed A thrill of feeling moving me To ask of what thy dreams may be? The lamp within thy heart is lit, The angels they have charge of it, What would the sleeper know? Through âmail and vizor glimmering,â The wrath of one like Ivanhoe, Comes he of whom the poets sing, âRed-hot, undying loveâ to show. As silent as the gravestones are, And black from top to toe, Is he now âdaring Deathâ for me; âPrevailing o'er the Foeâ? Sleep, sleep, my child, the hours beguile With wand'ring thought and wistful smile, Let visions come and go. As brave as any knight of old, With braver stories to be told; Is he now âspeeding o'er the seaâ By day-dawn at my side to be? Sleep, sleep, my child, the hours beguile With wand'ring thought and wistful smile, Let visions come and go. When his âgreat hands are holding mine,â I quote the poets whom I skim; Will there be ârivulets of wineâ In all my veins? Will âsilence take The place of speech,â and gladness make Me crazy when I welcome him? Sleep, sleep, my child, the hours beguile With wand'ring thought and wistful smile, Let visions come and go. When I have looked him up and down, Provoked his smile, and smoothed his frown, Oh, shall I dare to throw Myself into his armsâand kiss Like this, like this, like this, like this, BecauseâIâloveâhimâsoâ The one whose life and strength will be His âgreat resplendent giftâ to me:â I wantâI wantâto know? Sleep, sleep, my child, the hours beguile With wand'ring thought and wistful smile, Let visions come and go. Hand seeketh hand; there lies a vast, The sage has said, between The seeker and the sought, and this Is what has ever been. OUR PREMISSES. That was a baffling dream I had Of ladders in the sky, With nothing to support them there, Set up for me to try. OUR IDEALS. âTo Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love All pray in their distress?â Their souls have healing words for me; Embodied as they are, In floating forms that levitate Above the evening star. Ideals, elusive, distant, all Are worshipped where they stand, But there are earthly ties, alas! And thou hast one in hand. Invited am I, seeking rest, A stranger to my brain, To put thy kindness to the test, Beneath thy roof again? My friend, there travels through this night Of Winter, starved and poor, One unsupported by my hope Of welcome at thy door. A brother, called to mind again, Or sister, babe at breast:â My friend, have Pity, Peace, and Love, Our Idols, done their best? WILLIAM BLAKE. What though no second sight have we Like Blake, whose solemn eyes Saw Socrates at Turnham Green, And God on Kensal Rise. What though in certain books we seem To fare from bad to worse, Oh! in what other poet's work Have we the pearls of verse, That with the âquaintest human boshâ D. G. Rossetti, on Hayley's Poems. That mortal ever conned, Are bedded in the reams he wrote To friends who did respond To names that pull the reader up, Like Hayley, Butts, and Bond? He said that Milton dined with him, He said that we should see, If only we stayed long enough, Isaiah making tea. While we by this surprising talk Were not a little awed, With thrill of happiness in him He scattered smiles abroad. He talked as long as he did live; To what end no one knows; So little is the help we have From his exponents' prose. âAnd think you visions strange as his Were easy to explain?â Oh! agÃ¨d infant! hast thou not Twin shutters to thy brain? We close our eyes to bring the light Within the soul's domain, And many, wisely silent, see, As he did in the skies, Above the setting sun at eve The hosts of Heaven rise. Ideals we have, pursued alas, By less than very few, And he who writes of England's Art Can name but one or two. The latest gave us eyes that see G. F. Watts. The great in little things; He painted her who folds at night About the earth her wings. And what did Blake? Conceptions vast, Too great for any stage, Transcending all the bounds of thought, We have on pictured page. From great to little, yonder book, Songs of Innocence. The rarest of the rare, The casket of the spirit is That had its dwelling there. The little living things he drew, At the appointed time Did into places given them By means of feelers climb. The little living things he drew, Did caps and pinions don; The rhythm of the poet's line, The artist carried on:â Oh! when will singer strike again So pure a note in song? With harp at rest, the Minstrel asks:â âOh! Lord of Love, how long?â</field>
