Suffolk Cheese. Spring coming forth. Sheep fond of changing Lambs at play. The Butcher, &amp;c. O come, blest Spirit! whatsoe'er thou art, Thou kindling warmth that hover'st round my heart, Sweet inmate, hail! thou source of sterling joy, That poverty itself cannot destroy, Be thou my Muse; and faithful still to me, Retrace the paths of wild obscurity. No deeds of arms my humble lines rehearse; No Alpine wonders thunder through my verse, The roaring cataract, the snow-topt hill, Inspiring awe, till breath itself stands still: Nature's sublimer scenes ne'er charm'd mine eyes, Nor Science led me through the boundless skies; From meaner objects far my raptures flow: O point these raptures! bid my bosom glow! And lead my soul to ecstasies of praise For all the blessings of my infant days! Bear me through regions where gay Fancy dwells; But mould to Truth's fair form what Memory tells. Live, trifling incidents, and grace my song, That to the humblest menial belong: To him whose drudgery unheeded goes, His joys unreckon'd as his cares or woes; Though joys and cares in every path are sown, And youthful minds have feelings of their own, Quick springing sorrows, transient as the dew, Delights from trifles, trifles ever new. 'Twas thus with Giles: meek, fatherless, and poor Labour his portion, but he felt no more; No stripes, no tyranny his steps pursu'd; His life was constant, cheerful, servitude: Strange to the world, he wore a bashful look, The fields his study, Nature was his book; And, as revolving Seasons chang'd the scene From heat to cold, tempestuous to serene, Though every change still varied his employ, Yet each new duty brought its share of joy. Where noble Grafton spreads his rich domains, Round Euston's water'd vale, and sloping plains, Where woods and groves in solemn grandeur rise, Where the kite brooding unmolested flies; The woodcock and the painted pheasant race, And sculking Foxes, destin'd for the chace; There Giles, untaught and unrepining, stray'd Through every copse, and grove, and winding glade; There his first thoughts to Nature's charms inclin'd, That stamps devotion on th' inquiring mind. A little farm his generous Master till'd, Who with peculiar grace his station fill'd; By deeds of hospitality endear'd, Serv'd from affection, for his worth rever'd; A happy offspring blest his plenteous board, His fields were fruitful, and his barns well stor'd. And fourscore ewes he fed, a sturdy team, And lowing kine that graz'd beside the stream: Unceasing industry he kept in view; And never lack'd a job for Giles to do. Fled now the sullen murmurs of the North, The splendid raiment of the Spring peeps forth; Her universal green, and the clear sky, Delight still more and more the gazing eye. Wide o'er the fields, in rising moisture strong, Shoots up the simple flower, or creeps along The mellow'd soil; imbibing fairer hues, Or sweets from frequent showers and evening dews; That summon from their sheds the slumb'ring plows, While health impregnates every breeze that blows. No wheels support the diving, pointed, share; No groaning ox is doom'd to labour there; No helpmates teach the docile steed his road; (Alike unknown the ploughboy and the goad;) But, unassisted through each toilsome day, With smiling brow the ploughman cleaves his way, Draws his fresh parallels, and, wid'ning still, Treads slow the heavy dale, or climbs the hill: Strong on the wing his busy followers play, Where writhing earth-worms meet th' unwelcome day Till all is chang'd, and hill and level down Assume a livery of sober brown: Again disturb'd, when Giles with wearying strides From ridge to ridge the ponderous harrow guides; His heels deep sinking every step he goes, Till dirt adhesive loads his clouted shoes. Welcome green headland! firm beneath his feet; Welcome the friendly bank's refreshing seat; There, warm with toil, his panting horses browse Their shelt'ring canopy of pendent boughs; Till rest, delicious, chase each transient pain, And new-born vigour swell in every vein. Hour after hour, and day to day succeeds; Till every clod and deep-drawn furrow spreads To crumbling mould; a level surface clear, And strew'd with corn to crown the rising year; And o'er the whole Giles once transverse again, In earth's moist bosom buries up the grain. The work is done; no more to man is given; The grateful Farmer trusts the rest to Heaven. Yet oft with anxious heart he looks around, And marks the first green blade that breaks the ground In fancy sees his trembling oats uprun, His tufted barley yellow with the sun; Sees clouds propitious shed their timely store, And all his harvest gather'd round his door. But still unsafe the big swoln grain below, A fav'rite morsel with the Rook and Crow; From field to field the flock increasing goes; To level crops most formidable foes: Their danger well the wary plunderers know, And place a watch on some conspicuous bough; Yet oft the sculking gunner by surprise Will scatter death amongst them as they rise. These, hung in triumph round the spacious field, At best will but a short-liv'd terror yield: Nor guards of property; (not penal law, But harmless riflemen of rags and straw;) Familiariz'd to these, they boldly rove, Nor heed such sentinels that never move. Let then your birds lie prostrate on the earth, In dying posture, and with wings stretcht forth; Shift them at eve or morn from place to place, And Death shall terrify the pilfering race; In the mid air, while circling round and round, They call their lifeless comrades from the ground; With quick'ning wing, and notes of loud alarm, Warn the whole flock to shun th' impending harm. This task had Giles, in fields remote from home: Oft has he wish'd the rosy morn to come: Yet never fam'd was he nor foremost found To break the seal of sleep; his sleep was sound: But when at day-break summon'd from his bed, Light as the lark that carol'd o'er his head.â His sandy way, deep-worn by hasty showers, O'er-arch'd with oaks that form'd fantastic bow'rs, Waving aloft their tow'ring branches proud, In borrow'd tinges from the eastern cloud, Gave inspiration, pure as ever flow'd, And genuine transport in his bosom glow'd. His own shrill matin join'd the various notes Of Nature's music, from a thousand throats: The Blackbird strove with emulation sweet, And Echo answer'd from her close retreat; The sporting White-throat on some twig's end borne, Pour'd hymns to freedom and the rising morn; Stopt in her song perchance the starting Thrush Shook a white shower from the black-thorn bush, Where dew-drops thick as early blossoms hung, And trembled as the minstrel sweetly sung. Across his path, in either grove to hide, The timid Rabbit scouted by his side; Or Pheasant boldly stalk'd along the road, Whose gold and purple tints alternate glow'd. But groves no farther fenc'd the devious way; A wide-extended heath before him lay, Where on the grass the stagnant shower had run, And shone a mirror to the rising sun, Thus doubly seen to light a distant wood, To give new life to each expanding bud; And chase away the dewy foot-marks found, Where prowling Reynard trod his nightly round; To shun whose thefts 'twas Giles's evening care, His feather'd victims to suspend in air, High on the bough that nodded o'er his head, And thus each morn to strew the field with dead. His simple errand done, he homeward hies; Another instantly its place supplies. The clatt'ring Dairy-Maid immers'd in steam, Singing and scrubbing midst her milk and cream, Bawls out, âGo fetch the Cows!â....he hears no more; For pigs, and ducks, and turkies, throng the door, And sitting hens, for constant war prepar'd; A concert strange to that which late he heard. Straight to the meadow then he whistling goes; With well-known halloo calls his lazy Cows: Down the rich pasture heedlessly they graze, Or hear the summon with an idle gaze; For well they know the cow-yard yields no more Its tempting fragrance, nor its wintry store. Reluctance marks their steps, sedate and slow; The right of conquest all the law they know: The strong press on, the weak by turns succeed, And one superior always takes the lead; Is ever foremost, wheresoe'er they stray: Allow'd precedence, undisputed sway: With jealous pride her station is maintain'd, For many a broil that post of honour gain'd. At home, the yard affords a grateful scene; For Spring makes e'en a miry cow-yard clean. Thence from its chalky bed behold convey'd The rich manure that drenching Winter made, Which pil'd near home, grows green with many a weed, A promis'd nutriment for Autumn's seed. Forth comes the Maid, and like the morning smiles; The Mistress too, and follow'd close by Giles. A friendly tripod forms their humble seat, With pails bright scour'd, and delicately sweet. Where shadowing elms obstruct the morning ray, Begins the work, begins the simple lay; The full charg'd udder yields its willing streams, While Mary sings some lover's amorous dreams; And crouching Giles beneath a neighbouring tree Tugs o'er his pail, and chants with equal glee; Whose hat with tatter'd brim, of nap so bare, From the cow's side purloins a coat of hair, A mottled ensign of his harmless trade, An unambitious, peaceable cockade As unambitious too that cheerful aid The Mistress yields beside her rosy Maid; With joy she views her plenteous reeking store, And bears a brimmer to the dairv door; Her Cows dismiss'd, the luscious mead to roam, Till eve again recal them loaded home. And now the Dairy claims her choicest care, And half her household find employment there: Slow rolls the churn, its load of clogging cream At once foregoes its quality and name; From knotty particles first floating wide Congealing butter's dash'd from side to side; Streams of new milk through flowing coolers stray, And snow-white curd abounds, and wholesome whey, Due north th' unglazed windows, cold and clear, For warming sunbeams are unwelcome here. Brisk goes the work beneath each busy hand, And Giles must trudge, whoever gives command; A Gibeonite, that serves them all by turns: He drains the pump, from him the faggot burns; From him the noisy Hogs demand their food; While at his heels run many a chirping brood, Or down his path in expectation stand, With equal claims upon his strewing hand. Thus wastes the morn, till each with pleasure sees The bustle o'er, and press'd the new-made cheese. Unrivall'd stands thy country Cheese, O Giles! Whose very name alone engenders smiles; Whose fame abroad by every tongue is spoke, The well-known butt of many a flinty joke, That pass like current coin the nation through; And, ah! experience proves the satire true. Provision's grave, thou ever-craving mart, Dependant, huge Metropolis! where Art Her poring thousands stows in breathless rooms, Midst pois'nous smokes and steams, and rattling looms; Where Grandeur revels in unbounded stores; Restraint, a slighted stranger at their doors! Thou, like a whirlpool, drain'st the countries round, Till London market, London price, resound Through every town, round every passing load, And dairy produce throngs the eastern road: Delicious veal, and butter, every hour, From Essex lowlands, and the banks of Stour; And further far, where numerous herds repose, From Orwell's brink, from Waveny, or Ouse. Hence Suffolk dairy-wives run mad for cream, And leave their milk with nothing but its name; Its name derision and reproach pursue, And strangers tell of âthree times skimm'd sky-blue.â To cheese converted, what can be its boast? What, but the common virtues of a post! If drought o'ertake it faster than the knife, Most fair it bids for stubborn length of life, And, like the oaken shelf whereon 'tis laid, Mocks the weak efforts of the bending blade; Or in the hog-trough rests in perfect spite, Too big to swallow, and too hard to bite. Inglorious victory! Ye Cheshire meads, Or Severn's flow'ry dales, where Plenty treads, Was your rich milk to suffer wrongs like these, Farewell your pride! farewell renowned cheese! The skimmer dread, whose ravages alone Thus turn the mead's sweet nectar into stone. Neglected now the early daisy lies; Nor thou, pale primrose, bloom'st the only prize: Advancing Spring profusely spreads abroad Flow'rs of all hues, with sweetest fragrance stor'd; Where'er she treads, Love gladdens every plain, Delight on tiptoe bears her lucid train; Sweet Hope with conscious brow before her flies, Anticipating wealth from Summer skies; All Nature feels her renovating sway; The sheep-fed pasture, and the meadow gay, And trees, and shrubs, no longer budding seen Display the new-grown branch of lighter green; On airy downs the idling Shepherd lies, And sees to-morrow in the marbled skies. Here then, my soul, thy darling theme pursue, For every day was Giles a shepherd too. Small was his charge: no wilds had they to roam; But bright inclosures circling round their home. No yellow-blossom'd furze, nor stubborn thorn, The heath's rough produce, had their fleeces torn Yet ever roving, ever seeking thee, Enchanting spirit, dear Variety! O happy tenants, prisoners of a day! Releas'd to ease, to pleasure, and to play; Indulg'd through every field by turns to range, And taste them all in one continual change. For though luxuriant their grassy food, Sheep long confin'd but loathe the present good Bleating around the homeward gate they meet, And starve, and pine, with plenty at their feet. Loos'd from the winding lane, a joyful throng, See, o'er yon pasture, how they pour along! Giles round their boundaries takes his usual stroll; Sees every pass secur'd, and fences whole; High fences, proud to charm the gazing eye, Where many a nestling first assays to fly; Where blows the woodbine, faintlystreak'd with red, And rests on every bough its tender head; Round the young ash its twining branches meet, Or crown the hawthorn with its odours sweet. Say, ye that know, ye who have felt and seen, Spring's morning smiles, and soul-enliv'ning green, Say, did you give the thrilling transport way? Did your eye brighten, when young Lambs at play Leap'd o'er your path with animated pride, Or gaz'd in merry clusters by your side? Ye who can smile, to wisdom no disgrace, At the arch meaning of a Kitten's face: If spotless innocence, and infant mirth, Excites to praise, or gives reflection birth; In shades like these pursue your fav'rite joy, Midst Nature's revels, sports that never cloy. A few begin a short but vigorous race, And Indolence abash'd soon flies the place; Thus challeng'd forth, see thither one by one, From every side assembling playmates run; A thousand wily anties mark their stay, A starting crowd, impatient of delay. Like the fond dove from fearful prison freed, Each seems to say, âCome, let us try our speed;' Away they scour, impetuous, ardent, strong, The green turf trembling as they bound along; Adown the slope, then up the hillock climb, Where every molehill is a bed of thyme; There panting stop; yet scarcely can refrain; A bird, a leaf, will set them off again: Or, if a gale with strength unusual blow, Scatt'ring the wild-briar roses into snow, Their little limbs increasing efforts try, Like the torn flower the fair assemblage fly. Ah, fallen rose! sad emblem of their doom; Frail as thyself, they perish while they bloom! Though unoffending Innocence may plead, Though frantic Ewes may mourn the savage deed, Their shepherd comes, a messenger of blood, And drives them bleating from their sports and food Care loads his brow, and pity wrings his heart, For lo, the murd'ring Butcher, with his cart, Demands the firstlings of his flock to die, And makes a sport of life and liberty! His gay companions Giles beholds no more; Clos'd are their eyes, their fleeces drench'd in gore; Nor can Compassion, with her softest notes, Withhold the knife that plunges thro' their throats. Down, indignation! hence, ideas foul! Away the shocking image from my soul! Let kindlier visitants attend my way, Beneath approaching Summer's fervid ray; Nor thankless glooms obtrude, nor cares annoy, Whilst the sweet theme is universal joy. SUMMER. II. ARGUMENT. Turnip sowing. Wheat ripening. Sparrows. Insects. The sky-lark. Reaping, &amp;c. Harvest-field, Dairymaid, &amp;c. Labours of the barn. The gander. Night; a thunder-storm. Harvest-home. Reflections, &amp;c. The Farmer's life displays in every part A moral lesson to the sensual heart. Though in the lap of Plenty, thoughtful still, He looks beyond the present good or ill; Nor estimates alone one blessing's worth, From changeful seasons, or capricious earth; But views the future with the present hours, And looks for failures as he looks for showers; For casual as for certain want prepares, And round his yard the reeking haystack rears; Or clover, blossom'd lovely to the sight, His team's rich store through many a wintry night. What though abundance round his dwelling spreads, Though ever moist his self-improving meads Supply his dairy with a copious flood, And seem to promise unexhausted food; That promise fails, when buried deep in snow, And vegetative juices cease to flow. For this, his plough turns up the destin'd lands, Whence stormy Winter draws its full demands; For this, the seed minutely small, he sows, Whence, sound and sweet, the hardy turnip grows. But how unlike to April's closing days! High climbs the Sun, and darts his powerful rays; Whitens the fresh-drawn mould, and pierces through The cumb'rous clods that tumble round the plough. O'er heaven's bright azure hence with joyful eyes The Farmer sees dark clouds assembling rise; Borne o'er his fields a heavy torrent falls, And strikes the earth in hasty driving squalls. âRight welcome down, ye precious drops,â he cries; But soon, too soon, the partial blessing flies. âBoy, bring the harrows, try how deep the rain âHas forc'd its way.â He comes, but comes in vain; Dry dust beneath the bubbling surface lurks, And mocks his pains the more, the more he works: Still, midst huge clods, he plunges on forlorn, That laugh his harrows and the shower to scorn. E'en thus the living clod, the stubborn fool, Resists the stormy lectures of the school, Till tried with gentler means, the dunce to please, His head imbibes right reason by degrees; As when from eve till morning's wakeful hour, Light, constant rain evinces secret pow'r, And ere the day resumes its wonted smiles, Presents a cheerful, easy task for Giles. Down with a touch the mellow'd soil is laid, And yon tall crop next claims his timely aid; Thither well pleas'd he hies, assur'd to find Wild, trackless haunts, and objects to his mind. Shot up from broad rank blades that droop below, The nodding wheat-ear forms a graceful bow, With milky kernels starting full, weigh'd down, Ere yet the sun hath ting'd its head with brown; There thousands in a flock, for ever gay, Loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day, And from the mazes of the leafy thorn Drop one by one upon the bending corn. Giles with a pole assails their close retreats, And round the grass grown dewy border beats, On either side completely overspread, Here branches bend, there corn o'ertops his head. Green covert, hail! for through the varying year No hours so sweet, no scene to him so dear. Here Wisdom's placid eye delighted sees His frequent intervals of lonely ease, And with one ray his infant soul inspires, Just kindling there her never-dying fires, Whence solitude derives peculiar charms, And heaven-directed thought his bosom warms. Just where the parting bough's light shadows play, Scarce in the shade, nor in the scorching day, Stretch'd on the turf he lies, a peopled bed, Where swarming insects creep around his head. The small dust-colour'd beetle climbs with pain O'er the smooth plantain-leaf, a spacious plain Thence higher still, by countless steps convey'd He gains the summit of a shiv'ring blade, And flirts his filmy wings, and looks around, Exulting in his distance from the ground. The tender speckled moth here dancing seen, The vaulting grasshopper of glossy green, And all prolific Summer's sporting train, Their little lives by various pow'rs sustain. But what can unassisted vision do? What, but recoil where most it would pursue; His patient gaze but finish with a sigh, When Music waking speaks the sky-lark nigh Just starting from the corn, he cheerly sings, And trusts with conscious pride his downy wings; Still louder breathes, and in the face of day Mounts up, and calls on Giles to mark his way. Close to his eyes his hat he instant bends, And forms a friendly telescope, that lends Just aid enough to dull the glaring light, And place the wand'ring bird before his sight, That oft beneath a light cloud sweeps along, Lost for awhile, yet pours the varied song: The eye still follows, and the cloud moves by, Again he stretches up the clear blue sky; His form, his motion, undistinguish'd quite, Save when he wheels direct from shade to light: E'en then the songster a mere speck became, Gliding like fancy's bubbles in a dream, The gazer sees; but yielding to repose, Unwittingly his jaded eyelids close. Delicious sleep! From sleep who could forbear, With no more guilt than Giles, and no more care! Peace o'er his slumbers waves her guardian wing, Nor Conscience once disturbs him with a sting; He wakes refresh'd from every trivial pain, And takes his pole, and brushes round again. Its dark-green hue, its sicklier tints all fail, And ripening Harvest rustles in the gale. A glorious sight, if glory dwells below, Where Heav'n's munificence makes all the show O'er every field and golden prospect found, That glads the Ploughman's Sunday morning's round, When on some eminence he takes his stand, To judge the smiling produce of the land. Here Vanity slinks back, her head to hide What is there here to flatter human pride? The tow'ring fabric, or the dome's loud roar, And stedfast columns, may astonish more, Where the charm'd gazer long delighted stays, Yet trac'd but to the architect the praise; Whilst here, the veriest clown that treads the sod, Without one scruple gives the praise to God; And twofold joys possess his raptur'd mind, From gratitude and admiration join'd. Here, midst the boldest triumphs of her worth, Nature herself invites the reapers forth; Dares the keen sickle from its twelvemonth's rest, And gives that ardour which in every breast From infancy to age alike appears, When the first sheaf its plumy top uprears. No rake takes here what Heaven to all bestowsâ Children of want, for you the bounty flows! And every cottage from the plenteous store Receives a burden nightly at its door. Hark! where the sweeping scythe now rips along Each sturdy Mower, emulous and strong, Whose writhing form meridian heat defies, Bends o'er his work, and every sinew tries; Prostrates the waving treasure at his feet, But spares the rising clover, short and sweet. Come, Health! come, Jollity! light-footed, come; Here hold your revels, and make this your home. Each heart awaits and hails you as its own; Each moisten'd brow, that scorns to wear a frown Th' unpeopled dwelling mourns its tenants stray'd; E'en the domestic laughing dairy-maid Hies to the field, the general toil to share. Meanwhile the Farmer quits his elbow-chair, His cool brick floor, his pitcher, and his ease, And braves the sultry beams, and gladly sees His gates thrown open, and his team abroad, The ready group attendant on his word, To turn the swarth, the quiv'ring load to rear, Or ply the busy rake, the land to clear. Summer's light garb itself now cumb'rous grown, Each his thin doublet in the shade throws down; Where oft the Mastiff sculks with half-shut eye, And rouses at the stranger passing by; Whilst unrestrain'd the social converse flows, And every breast Love's powerful impulse knows, And rival wits with more than rustic grace Confess the presence of a pretty face. For, lo! encircled there, the lovely Maid, In youth's own bloom and native smiles array'd; Her hat awry, divested of her gown, Her creaking stays of leather, stout and brown; Invidious barrier! why art thou so high, When the slight covering of her neck slips by, There half revealing to the eager sight Her full, ripe bosom, exquisitely white? In many a local tale of harmless mirth, And many a jest of momentary birth, She bears a part, and as she stops to speak, Strokes back the ringlets from her glowing cheek. Now noon gone by, and four declining hours, The weary limbs relax their boasted pow'rs; Thirst rages strong, the fainting spirits fail, And ask the sov'reign cordial, home-brew'd ale: Beneath some shelt'ring heap of yellow corn Rests the hoop'd keg, and friendly cooling horn, That mocks alike the goblet's brittle frame, Its costlier potions, and its nobler name. To Mary first the brimming draught is given, By toil made welcome as the dews of heaven, And never lip that press'd its homely edge Had kinder blessings, or a heartier pledge. Of wholesome viands here a banquet smiles, A common cheer for all;âe'en humble Giles, Who joys his trivial services to yield Amidst the fragrance of the open field; Oft doom'd in suffocating heat to bear The cobweb'd barn's impure and dusty air; To ride in mirky state the panting steed, Destin'd aloft th' unloaded grain to tread, Where, in his path as heaps on heaps are thrown, He rears, and plunges the loose mountain down: Laborious task! with what delight when done Both horse and rider greet th' unclouded sun! Yet by th' unclouded sun are hourly bred The bold assailants that surround thine head, Poor, patient Ball! and with insulting wing Roar in thine ears, and dart the piercing sting. In thy behalf the crest-wav'd boughs avail More than thy short-clipt remnant of a tail, A moving mockery, a useless name, A living proof of cruelty and shame Shame to the man, whatever fame he bore, Who took from thee what man can ne'er restore, Thy weapon of defence, thy chiefest good, When swarming flies contending suck thy blood. Nor thine alone the suff'ring, thine the care, The fretful Ewe bemoans an equal share; Tormented into sores, her head she hides, Or angry sweeps them from her new-shorn sides. Penn'd in the yard, e'en now at closing day Unruly Cows with mark'd impatience stay, And vainly striving to escape their foes, The pail kick down; a piteous current flows. Is't not enough that plagues like these molest? Must still another foe annoy their rest? He comes, the pest and terror of the yard, His full-fledg'd progeny's imperious guard; The Gander;âspiteful, insolent, and bold, At the colt's footlock takes his daring hold There, serpent like, escapes a dreadful blow; And straight attacks a poor defenceless cow Each booby Goose th' unworthy strife enjoys, And hails his prowess with redoubled noise. Then back he stalks, of self-importance full, Seizes the shaggy foretop of the Bull, Till whirl'd aloft he falls: a timely check, Enough to dislocate his worthless neck: For lo! of old, he boasts an honour'd wound; Behold that broken wing that trails the ground! Thus fools and bravoes kindred pranks pursue; As savage quite, and oft as fatal too. Happy the man that foils an envious elf, Using the darts of spleen to serve himself. As when by turns the strolling Swine engage The utmost efforts of the bully's rage, Whose nibbling warfare on the grunter's side Is welcome pleasure to his bristly hide; Gently he stoops, or stretch'd at ease along, Enjoys the insults of the gabbling throng, That march exulting round his fallen head, As human victors trample on their dead. Still Twilight, welcome! Rest, how sweet art thou Now eve o'erhangs the western cloud's thick brow: The far-stretch'd curtain of retiring light, With fiery treasures fraught; that on the sight Flash from its bulging sides, where darkness lours, In Fancy's eye, a chain of mould'ring tow'rs; Or craggy coasts just rising into view, Midst jav'lins dire, and darts of streaming blue. Anon tir'd laborers bless their shelt'ring home, When Midnight, and the frightful Tempest come. The Farmer wakes, and sees with silent dread The angry shafts of Heaven gleam round his bed; The bursting cloud reiterated roars, Shakes his straw roof, and jars his bolted doors: The slow-wing'd storm along the troubled skies Spreads its dark course; the wind begins to rise; And full-leaf'd elms, his dwelling's shade by day, With mimic thunder give its fury way: Sounds in his chimney-top a doleful peal Midst pouring rain, or gusts of rattling hail; With tenfold danger low the tempest bends And quick and strong the sulph'rous flame descends. The frighten'd Mastiff from his kennel flies, And cringes at the door with piteous cries.â Where now's the trifler? where the child of pride? These are the moments when the heart is try'd! Nor lives the man, with conscience e'er so clear, But feels a solemn, reverential fear; Feels too a joy relieve his aching breast, When the spent storm hath howl'd itself to rest. Still, welcome beats the long-continued show'r, And sleep protracted, comes with double pow'r; Calm dreams of bliss bring on the morning sun, For every barn is fill'd, and Harvest done! Now, ere sweet Summer bids its long adieu, And winds blow keen where late the blossom grew, The bustling day and jovial night must come, The long-accustom'd feast of Harvest-home. No blood-stain'd victory, in story bright, Can give the philosophic mind delight; No triumph please, while rage and death destroy. Reflection sickens at the monstrous joy. And where the joy, if rightly understood, Like cheerful praise for universal good? The soul nor check nor doubtful anguish knows, But free and pure the grateful current flows. Behold the sound oak table's massy frame Bestride the kitchen floor! the careful dame And gen'rous host invite their friends around, For all that clear'd the crop, or till'd the ground, Are guests by right of custom:âold and young; And many a neighbouring yeoman join the throng, With artizans that lent their dext'rous aid, When o'er each field the flaming sunbeams play'd. Yet Plenty reigns, and from her boundless hoard; Though not one jelly trembles on the board, Supplies the feast with all that sense can crave; With all that made our great forefathers brave, Ere the cloy'd palate countless flavours try'd, And cooks had Nature's judgment set aside. With thanks to Heaven and tales of rustic lore, The mansion echoes when the banquet's o'er; A wider circle spreads, and smiles abound, As quick the frothing horn performs its round; Care's mortal foe; that sprightly joys imparts To cheer the frame and elevate their hearts. Here, fresh and brown, the hazel's produce lies In tempting heaps, and peals of laughter rise, And crackling Music, with the frequent Song, Unheeded bear the midnight hour along. Here once a year Distinction low'rs its crest, The master, servant, and the merry guest, Are equal all; and round the happy ring The reaper's eyes exulting glances fling, And, warm'd with gratitude, he quits his place, With sun-burnt hands and ale-enliven'd face, Refills the jug his honour'd host to tend, To serve at once the master and the friend; Proud thus to meet his smiles, to share his tale, His nuts, his conversation, and his ale. Such were the days,âof days long past I sing, When Pride gave place to mirth without a sting; Ere tyrant customs strength sufficient bore To violate the feelings of the poor; To leave them distanc'd in the mad'ning race, Where'er refinement shows its hated face: Nor causeless hated;â'tis the peasant's curse, That hourly makes his wretched station worse; Destroys life's intercourse; the social plan That rank to rank cements, as man to man: Wealth flows around him, Fashion lordly reigns; Yet poverty is his, and mental pains. Methinks I hear the mourner thus impart The stifled murmurs of his wounded heart: âWhence comes this change, ungracious, irksome, cold! âWhence the new grandeur that mine eyes behold? âThe widening distance which I daily see, âHas Wealth done this?âthen Wealth's a foe to me; âFoe to our rights; that leaves a pow'rful few âThe paths of emulation to pursue:â âFor emulation stoops to us no more: âThe hope of humble industry is o'er; âThe blameless hope, the cheering sweet presage âOf future comforts for declining age. âCan my sons share from this paternal hand âThe profits with the labours of the land? âNo; though indulgent Heaven its blessing deigns, âWhere's the small farm to suit my scanty means? âContent, the Poet sings, with us resides; âIn lonely cots like mine, the Damsel hides; âAnd will he then in raptur'd visions tell âThat sweet Content with Want can ever dwell? âA barley loaf, 'tis true, my table crowns, âThat, fast diminishing in lusty rounds, âStops Nature's cravings; yet her sighs will flow âFrom knowing this,âthat once it was not so. âOur annual feast, when Earth her plenty yields, âWhen crown'd with boughs the last load quits the fields, âThe aspect still of ancient joy puts on; âThe aspect only, with the substance gone: âThe self-same Horn is still at our command, âBut serves none now but the plebeian hand: âFor home-brew'd Ale, neglected and debas'd, âIs quite discarded from the realms of taste. âWhere unaffected Freedom charm'd the soul, âThe separate table and the costly bowl, âCool as the blast that checks the budding Spring âA mockery of gladness round them fling. âFor oft the Farmer, ere his heart approves, âYields up the custom which he dearly loves: âRefinement forces on him like a tide; âBold innovations down its current ride, âThat bear no peace beneath their showy dress, âNor add one tittle to his happiness. âHis guests selected; rank's punctilios known; âWhat trouble waits upon a casual frown! âRestraint's foul manacles his pleasures maim; âSelected guests selected phrases claim: âNor reigns that joy, when hand in hand they join, âThat good old Master felt in shaking mine. âHeaven bless his memory! bless his honour'd name. â(The Poor will speak his lasting worthy fame:) âTo souls fair-purpos'd strength and guidance give; âIn pity to us still let goodness live: âLet labour have its due! my cot shall be âFrom chilling want and guilty murmurs free: âLet labour have its due; then peace is mine, âAnd never, never shall my heart repine.â AUTUMN. III. ARGUMENT. Acorns. Hogs in the Wood. Wheat-sowing. The Church. Village Girls. The mad Girl. The Bird-Boy's Hut. Disappointment; Reflections, &amp;c. Euston-hall. Fox-hunting Old Trouncer Long Nights. A Welcome to Winter. Again, the year's decline, midst storms and floods, The thundering chase, the yellow fading woods, Invite my song; that fain would boldly tell Of upland coverts, and the echoing dell, By turns resounding loud, at eve and morn The swineherd's halloo, or the huntsman's horn. No more the fields with scatter'd grain supply The restless wandering tenants of the sty; From oak to oak they run with eager haste, And wrangling share the first delicious taste Of fallen Acorns; yet but thinly found Till the strong gale has shook them to the ground. It comes; and roaring woods obedient wave: Their home well pleas'd the joint adventurers leave: The trudging Sow leads forth her numerous young, Playful, and white, and clean, the briars among, Till briars and thorns increasing, fence them round, Where last year's mould'ring leaves bestrew the groun And o'er their heads, loud lash'd by furious squalls, Bright from their cups the rattling treasure falls; Hot, thirsty food; whence doubly sweet and cool The welcome margin of some rush-grown pool, The Wild Duck's lonely haunt, whose jealous eye Guards every point; who sits, prepar'd to fly, On the calm bosom of her little lake, Too closely screen'd for ruffian winds to shake; And as the bold intruders press around, At once she starts, and rises with a bound: With bristles rais'd the sudden noise they hear, And ludicrously wild, and wing'd with fear, The herd decamp with more than swinish speed, And snorting dash through sedge, and rush, and reed: Through tangling thickets headlong on they go, Then stop and listen for their fancied foe; The hindmost still the growing panic spreads, Repeated fright the first alarm succeeds, Till Folly's wages, wounds and thorns, they reap: Yet glorying in their fortunate escape, Their groundless terrors by degrees soon cease, And Night's dark reign restores their wonted peace. For now the gale subsides, and from each bough The roosting Pheasant's short but frequent crow Invites to rest; and huddling side by side, The herd in closest ambush seek to hide; Seek some warm slope with shagged moss o'erspread, Dry'd leaves their copious covering and their bed, In vain may Giles, through gath'ring glooms that fall, And solemn silence, urge his piercing call: Whole days and nights they tarry midst their store, Nor quit the woods till oaks can yield no more. Beyond bleak Winter's rage, beyond the Spring That rolling Earth's unvarying course will bring, Who tills the ground looks on with mental eye, And sees next Summer's sheaves and cloudless sky; And even now, whilst Nature's beauty dies, Deposits Seed, and bids new Harvests rise; Seed well prepar'd, and warm'd with glowing lime, 'Gainst earth-bred grubs, and cold, and lapse of time: For searching frosts and various ills invade, Whilst wintry months depress the springing blade. The plough moves heavily, and strong the soil, And clogging harrows with augmented toil Dive deep: and clinging, mixes with the mould A fatt'ning treasure from the nightly fold, And all the cow-yard's highly valu'd store, That late bestrew'd the blacken'd surface o'er. No idling hours are here, when Fancy trims Her dancing taper over outstretch'd limbs, And in her thousand thousand colours drest, Plays round the grassy couch of noontide rest: Here Giles for hours of indolence atones With strong exertion, and with weary bones, And knows no leisure; till the distant chime Of Sabbath bells he hears at sermon time, That down the brook sound sweetly in the gale, Or strike the rising hill, or skim the dale. Nor his alone the sweets of case to taste: Kind rest extends to all;âsave one poor beast, That true to time and pace, is doom'd to plod, To bring the Pastor to the House of God; Mean structure; where no bones of heroes lie! The rude inelegance of poverty Reigns here alone: else why that roof of straw? Those narrow windows with the frequent flaw? O'er whose low cells the dock and mallow spread, And rampant nettles lift the spiry head, Whilst from the hollows of the tower on high The grey-eapp'd Daws in saucy legions fly. Round these lone walls assembling neighbours meet, And tread departed friends beneath their feet; And new-briar'd graves, that prompt the secret sigh, Show each the spot where he himself must lie. Midst timely greetings village news goes round, Of crops late shorn, or crops that deck the ground; Experienc'd ploughmen in the circle join; While sturdy boys, in feats of strength to shine, With pride elate, their young associates brave To jump from hollow-sounding grave to grave; Then close consulting, each his talent lends To plan fresh sports when tedious service ends. Hither at times, with cheerfulness of soul, Sweet village Maids from neighbouring hamlets stroll, That like the light-heel'd does o'er lawns that rove, Look shyly curious; rip'ning into love; For love's their errand: hence the tints that glow On either cheek, a heighten'd lustre know: When, conscious of their charms, e'en Age looks sly, And rapture beams from Youth's observant eye. The pride of such a party, Nature's pride, Was lovely Ann, who innocently try'd, With hat of airy shape and ribbons gay, Love to inspire, and stand in Hymen's way But, ere her twentieth Summer could expand, Or youth was render'd happy with her hand, Her mind's serenity, her peace was gone, Her eye grew languid, and she wept alone Yet causeless seem'd her grief; for quick restrain'd, Mirth follow'd loud; or indignation reign'd: Whims wild and simple led her from her home, The heath, the common, or the fields to roam: Terror and Joy alternate rul'd her hours; Now blithe she sung, and gather'd useless flow'rs; Now pluck'd a tender twig from ev'ry bough, To whip the hov'ring demons from her brow. Ill-fated Maid! thy guiding spark is fled, And lasting wretchedness awaits thy bedâ Thy bed of straw! for mark, where even now O'er their lost child afflicted parents bow; Their woe she knows not, but perversely coy, Inverted customs yield her sullen joy; Her midnight meals in secrecy she takes, Low mutt'ring to the moon, that rising breaks Thro' night's dark gloom:âoh how much more forlorn Her night, that knows of no returning morn!â Slow from the threshold, once her infant seat, O'er the cold earth she crawls to her retreat; Quitting the cot's warm walls, unhous'd to lie, Or share the swine's impure and narrow sty; The damp night air her shiv'ring limbs assails; In dreams she moans, and fancied wrongs bewails. When morning wakes, none earlier rous'd than she, When pendent drops fall glitt'ring from the tree; But nought her rayless melancholy cheers, Or sooths her breast, or stops her streaming tears. Her matted locks unornamented flow; Clasping her knees, and waving to and fro;â Her head bow'd down, her faded cheek to hide;â A piteous mourner by the pathway side. Some tufted molehill through the livelong day She calls her throne; there weeps her life away: And oft the gaily-passing stranger stays His well-tim'd step, and takes a silent gaze, Till sympathetic drops unbidden start, And pangs quick springing muster round his heart; And soft he treads with other gazers round, And fain would catch her sorrows' plaintive sound: One word alone is all that strikes the ear, One short, pathetic, simple word,ââOh dear!â A thousand times repeated to the wind, That wafts the sigh, but leaves the pang behind! For ever of the proffer'd parley shy, She hears th' unwelcome foot advancing nigh; Nor quite unconscious of her wretched plight, Gives one sad look, and hurries out of sight.â Fair promis'd sunbeams of terrestrial bliss, Health's gallant hopes,âand are ye sunk to this? For in life's road though thorns abundant grow, There still are joys poor Ann can never know; Joys which the gay companions of her prime Sip, as they drift along the stream of time; At eve to hear beside their tranquil home The lifted latch, that speaks the lover come: That love matur'd, next playful on the knee To press the velvet lip of infancy; To stay the tottering step, the features trace;â Inestimable sweets of social peace! O Thou, who bidst the vernal juices rise! Thou, on whose blasts autumnal foliage flies! Let Peace ne'er leave me, nor my heart grow cold, Whilst life and sanity are mine to hold. Shorn of their flow'rs that shed th' untreasur'd seed, The withering pasture, and the fading mead, Less tempting grown, diminish more and more, The dairy's pride; sweet Summer's flowing store. New cares succeed, and gentle duties press, Where the fire-side, a school of tenderness, Revives the languid chirp, and warms the blood Of cold-nipt weaklings of the latter brood, That from the shell just bursting into day, Through yard or pond pursue their vent'rous way. Far weightier cares and wider scenes expand; What devastation marks the new-sown land! âFrom hungry woodland foes go, Giles, and guard The rising wheat; ensure its great reward: A future sustenance, a Summer's pride, Demand thy vigilance: then be it try'd: Exert thy voice, and wield thy shotless gun: Go, tarry there from morn till setting sun.â Keen blows the blast, or ceaseless rain descends; The half-stript hedge a sorry shelter lends. O for a Hovel, e'er so small or low, Whose roof, repelling winds and early snow, Might bring home's comforts fresh before his eyes! No sooner thought, than see the structure rise, In some sequester'd nook, embank'd around, Sods for its walls, and straw in burdens bound Dried fuel hoarded is his richest store, And circling smoke obscures his little door; Whence creeping forth, to duty's call he yields, And strolls the Crusoe of the lonely fields. On whitethorns tow'ring, and the leafless rose, A frost-nipt feast in bright vermilion glows: Where clust'ring sloes in glossy order rise, He crops the loaded branch; a cumbrous prize; And o'er the flame the sputt'ring fruit he rests, Placing green sods to seat his coming guests; His guests by promise; playmates young and gay:â But ah! fresh pastimes lure their steps away! He sweeps his hearth, and homeward looks in vain Till feeling Disappointment's cruel pain, His fairy revels are exchang'd for rage, His banquet marr'd, grown dull his hermitage. The field becomes his prison, till on high Benighted birds to shades and coverts fly. Midst air, health, daylight, can he prisoner be? If fields are prisons, where is Liberty? Here still she dwells, and here her votaries stroll; But disappointed hope untunes the soul Restraints unfelt whilst hours of rapture flow, When troubles press, to chains and barriers grow. Look then from trivial up to greater woes; From the poor bird-boy with his roasted sloes, To where the dungeon'd mourner heaves the sigh; Where not one cheering sun-beam meets his eye. Though ineffectual pity thine may be, No wealth, no pow'r, to set the captive free; Though only to thy ravish'd sight is given The radiant path that Howard trod to heaven; Thy slights can make the wretched more forlorn, And deeper drive affliction's barbed thorn. Say not, âI'll come and cheer thy gloomy cell With news of dearest friends; how good, how well I'll be a joyful herald to thine heart:â Then fail, and play the worthless trifler's part, To sip flat pleasures from thy glass's brim, And waste the precious hour that's due to him. In mercy spare the base, unmanly blow: Where can he turn, to whom complain of you? Back to past joys in vain his thoughts may stray, Trace and retrace the beaten, worn-out way, The rankling injury will pierce his breast, And curses on thee break his midnight rest. Bereft of song, and ever-cheering green, The soft endearments of the Summer scene, New harmony pervades the solemn wood, Dear to the soul, and healthful to the blood: For bold exertion follows on the sound Of distant Sportsmen, and the chiding Hound; First heard from kennel bursting, mad with joy, Where smiling Euston boasts her good Fitzroy, Lord of pure alms, and gifts that wide extend; The farmer's patron, and the poor man's friend: Whose Mansion glitters with the eastern ray Whose elevated temple points the way, O'er slopes and lawns, the park's extensive pride, To where the victims of the chase reside, Ingulf'd in earth, in conscious safety warm, Till lo! a plot portends their coming harm. In earliest hours of dark and hooded morn, Ere yet one rosy cloud bespeaks the dawn, Whilst far abroad the Fox pursues his prey, He's doom'd to risk the perils of the day, From his strong hold block'd out; perhaps to bleed, Or owe his life to fortune or to speed. For now the pack, impatient rushing on, Range through the darkest coverts one by one; Trace every spot; whilst down each noble glade That guides the eye beneath a changeful shade, The loit'ring sportsman feels th' instinctive flame, And checks his steed to mark the springing game. Midst intersecting cuts and winding ways The huntsman cheers his dogs, and anxious strays Where every narrow riding, even shorn, Gives back the echo of his mellow horn: Till fresh and lightsome, every power untried, The starting fugitive leaps by his side, His lifted finger to his ear he plies, And the view-halloo bids a chorus rise Of Dogs quick-mouth'd, and shouts that mingle loud As bursting thunder rolls from cloud to cloud. With ears erect, and chest of vig'rous mould, O'er ditch, o'er fence, unconquerably bold, The shining courser lengthens every bound, And his strong foot-locks suck the moisten'd ground, As from the confines of the wood they pour, And joyous villages partake the roar. O'er heath far stretch'd, or down, or valley low, The stiff-limb'd peasant, glorying in the show, Pursues in vain; where Youth itself soon tires, Spite of the transports that the chase inspires: For who unmounted long can charm the eye, Or hear the music of the leading cry? Poor faithful Trouncer! thou canst lead no more; All thy fatigues and all thy triumphs o'er! Triumphs of worth, whose long-excelling fame Was still to follow true the hunted game; Beneath enormous oaks, Britannia's boast, In thick, impenetrable coverts lost, When the warm pack in fault'ring silence stood, Thine was the note that rous'd the list'ning wood, Rekindling every joy with tenfold force, Through all the mazes of the tainted course. Still foremost thou the dashing stream to cross, And tempt along the animated horse; Foremost o'er fen or level mead to pass, And sweep the show'ring dew-drops from the grass; Then bright emerging from the mist below To climb the woodland hill's exulting brow. Pride of thy race! with worth far less than thine, Full many human leaders daily shine! Less faith, less constancy, less gen'rous zeal!â Then no disgrace my humble verse shall feel, Where not one lying line to riches bows, Or poison'd sentiments from rancour flows; Nor flowers are strewn around Ambition's car: An honest Dog's a nobler theme by far. Each sportsman heard the tidings with a sigh, When Death's cold touch dad stopt his tuneful cry; And though high deeds, and fair exalted praise, In memory liv'd, and flow'd in rustic lays, Short was the strain of monumental woe: âFoxes rejoice! here buried lies your foe!â In safety hous'd, throughout Night's length'ning reign, The Cock sends forth a loud and piercing strain; More frequent, as the glooms of midnight flee, And hours roll round, that brought him liberty, When Summer's early dawn, mild, clear, and bright, Chas'd quick away the transitory night:â Hours now in darkness veil'd; yet loud the scream Of Geese impatient for the playful stream; And all the feather'd tribe imprison'd raise Their morning notes of inharmonious praise; And many a clamorous Hen and cockrel gay, When daylight slowly through the fog breaks way, Fly wantonly abroad: but, ah, how soon The shades of twilight follow hazy noon, Short'ning the busy day!âday that slides by Amidst th' unfinish'd toils of Husbandry; Toils still each morn resum'd with double care, To meet the icy terrors of the year; To meet the threats of Boreas undismay'd, And Winter's gathering frowns and hoary head. Then welcome, cold; welcome, ye snowy nights! Heaven midst your rage shall mingle pure delights, And confidence of hope the soul sustain, While devastation sweeps along the plain: Nor shall the child of poverty despair, But bless the Power that rules the changing year Assur'd,âthough horrors round his cottage reign,â That Spring will come, and Nature smile again.

The Post-horse Sheep-stealing Dogs. Walks occasioned thereby. The Ghost. Lamb Time. Returning Spring. Conclusion. With kindred pleasures mov'd, and cares opprest, Sharing alike our weariness and rest; Who lives the daily partner of our hours, Through every change of heat, and frost, and show'rs; Partakes our cheerful meals, partaking first In mutual labour and fatigue and thirst; The kindly intercourse will ever prove A bond of amity and social love. To more than man this generous warmth extends, And oft the team and shiv'ring herd befriends; Tender solicitude the bosom fills, And Pity executes what Reason wills: Youth learns compassion's tale from ev'ry tongue, And flies to aid the helpless and the young. When now, unsparing as the scourge of war, Blasts follow blasts, and groves dismantled roar, Around their home the storm-pinch'd Cattle lows, No nourishment in frozen pastures grows; Yet frozen pastures every morn resound With fair abundance thund'ring to the ground. For though on hoary twigs no buds peep out, And e'en the hardy brambles cease to sprout, Beneath dread Winter's level sheets of snow The sweet nutritious Turnip deigns to grow. Till now imperious want and wide-spread dearth Bid Labour claim her treasures from the earth. On Giles, and such as Giles, the labour falls, To strew the frequent load where hunger calls. On driving gales sharp hail indignant flies, And sleet, more irksome still, assails his eyes; Snow clogs his feet; or if no snow is seen, The field with all its juicy store to screen, Deep goes the frost, till every root is found A rolling mass of ice upon the ground. No tender ewe can break her nightly fast, Nor heifer strong begin the cold repast, Till Giles with pond'rous beetle foremost go, And scatt'ring splinters fly at every blow; When pressing round him, eager for the prize, From their mixt breath warm exhalations rise. In beaded rows if drops now deck the spray, While the sun grants a momentary ray, Let but a cloud's broad shadow intervene, And stiffen'd into gems the drops are seen; And down the furrow'd oak's broad southern side Streams of dissolving rime no longer glide. Though Night approaching bids for rest prepare, Still the flail echoes through the frosty air, Nor stops till deepest shades of darkness come, Sending at length the weary Labourer home. From him, with bed and nightly food supplied, Throughout the yard, hous'd round on ev'ry side, Deep-plunging Cows their rustling feast enjoy, And snatch sweet mouthfuls from the passing Boy Who moves unseen beneath his trailing load, Fills the tall racks, and leaves a scatter'd road, Where oft the swine from ambush warm and dry Bolt out, and scamper headlong to their sty, When Giles with well-known voice, already there, Deigns them a portion of his evening care. Him, though the cold may pierce, and storms molest, Succeeding hours shall cheer with warmth and rest; Gladness to spread, and raise the grateful smile, He hurls the faggot bursting from the pile, And many a log and rifted trunk conveys, To heap the fire, and wide extend the blaze, That quivering strong through every opening flies, Whilst smoky columns unobstructed rise. For the rude architect, unknown to fame, (Nor symmetry nor elegance his aim) Who spread his floors of solid oak on high, On beams rough-hewn, from age to age that lie, Bade his wide Fabric unimpair'd sustain The orchard's store, and cheese, and golden grain; Bade, from its central base, capacious laid, The well-wrought chimney rear its lofty head; Where since hath many a savoury ham been stor'd, And tempests howl'd, and Christmas gambols roar'd, Flat on the hearth the glowing embers lie, And flames reflected dance in every eye: There the long billet, forc'd at last to bend, While gushing sap froths out at either end, Throws round its welcome heat:âthe ploughman smiles, And oft the joke runs hard on sheepish Giles, Who sits joint tenant of the corner-stool, The converse sharing, though in duty's school; For now attentively 'tis his to hear Interrogations from the Master's chair. âLeft ye your bleating charge, when day-light fled, âNear where the hay-stack lifts its snowy head? âWhose fence of bushy furze, so close and warm, âMay stop the slanting bullets of the storm. âFor, hark! it blows; a dark and dismal night. âHeaven guide the trav'ller's fearful steps aright! âNow from the woods, mistrustful and sharp-ey'd, âThe Fox in silent darkness seems to glide, âStealing around us, list'ning as he goes, âIf chance the Cock or stamm'ring Capon crows, âOr Goose, or nodding Duck, should darkling cry, âAs if appriz'd of lurking danger nigh: âDestruction waits them, Giles, if e'er you fail âTo bolt their doors against the driving gale. âStrew'd you (still mindful of th' unshelter'd head) âBurdens of straw, the cattle's welcome bed? âThine heart should feel, what th?u may'st hourly see, âThat duty's basis is humanity. âOf pain's unsavoury cup though thou may'st taste, â(The wrath of Winter from the bleak north-east,) âThine utmost suff'rings in the coldest day âA period terminates, and joys repay. âPerhaps e'en now, while here those joys we boast, âFull many a bark rides down the neighb'ring coast, âWhere the high northern waves tremendous roar, âDrove down by blasts from Norway's icy shore. âThe Sea-boy there, less fortunate than thou, âFeels all thy pains in all the gusts that blow; âHis freezing hands now drench'd, now dry, by turns; âNow lost, now seen, the distant light that burns, âOn some tall cliff uprais'd, a flaming guide, âThat throws its friendly radiance o'er the tide. âHis labours cease not with declining day, âBut toils and perils mark his wat'ry way; âAnd whilst in peaceful dreams secure we lie, âThe ruthless whirlwinds rage along the sky, âRound his head whistling;âand shalt thou repine, âWhile this protecting roof still shelters thine!â Mild, as the vernal show'r, his words prevail, And aid the moral precept of his tale: His wond'ring hearers learn, and ever keep These first ideas of the restless deep; And, as the opening mind a circuit tries, Present felicities in value rise. Increasing pleasures every hour they find, The warmth more precious, and the shelter kind; Warmth that long reigning bids the eyelids close, As through the blood its balmy influence goes, When the cheer'd heart forgets fatigues and cares, And drowsiness alone dominion bears. Sweet then the ploughman's slumbers, hale and young When the last topic dies upon his tongue; Sweet then the bliss his transient dreams inspire, Till chilblains wake him, or the snapping fire: He starts, and ever thoughtful of his team, Along the glitt'ring snow a feeble gleam Shoots from his lantern, as he yawning goes To add fresh comforts to their night's repose; Diffusing fragrance as their food he moves, And pats the jolly sides of those he loves. Thus full replenish'd, perfect ease possest, From night till morn alternate food and rest, No rightful cheer withheld, no sleep debarr'd, Their each day's labour brings its sure reward. Yet when from plough or lumb'ring cart set free, They taste awhile the sweets of liberty: E'en sober Dobbin lifts his clumsy heel And kicks, disdainful of the dirty wheel; But soon, his frolic ended, yields again To trudge the road, and wear the clinking chain. Short-sighted Dobbin!âthou canst only see The trivial hardships that encompass thee: Thy chains were freedom, and thy toils repose: Could the poor post-horse tell thee all his woes; Show thee his bleeding shoulders, and unfold The dreadful anguish he endures for gold: Hir'd at each call of business, lust, or rage, That prompts the trav'ller on from stage to stage. Still on his strength depends their boasted speed; For them his limbs grow weak, his bare ribs bleed; And though he groaning quickens at eommand, Their extra shilling in the rider's hand Becomes his bitter scourge;â'tis he must feel The double efforts of the lash and steel; Till when, up hill, the destin'd inn he gains, And trembling under complicated pains, Prone from his nostrils, darting on the ground, His breath emitted floats in clouds around: Drops chase each other down his chest and sides, And spatter'd mud his native colour hides: Through his swoln veins the boiling torrent flows, And every nerve a separate torture knows. His harness loos'd, he welcomes, eager-eyed, The pail's full draught that quivers by his side; And joys to see the well-known stable door, As the starv'd mariner the friendly shore. Ah, well for him if here his sufferings ceas'd, And ample hours of rest his pains appeas'd! But rous'd again, and sternly bade to rise, And shake refreshing slumber from his eyes, Ere his exhausted spirits can return, Or through his frame reviving ardour burn, Come forth he must, though limping, maim'd, and sore; He hears the whip; the chaise is at the door:â The collar tightens, and again he feels His half-heal'd wounds inflam'd; again the wheels With tiresome sameness in his ears resound, O'er blinding dust, or miles of flinty ground. Thus nightly robb'd, and injur'd day by day, His piece-meal murderers wear his life away. What say'st thou, Dobbin? what though hounds await With open jaws the moment of thy fate, No better fate attends his public race; His life is misery, and his end disgrace. Then freely bear thy burden to the mill; Obey but one short law,âthy driver's will. Affection to thy memory ever true, Shall boast of mighty loads that Dobbin drew; And back to childhood shall the mind with pride Recount thy gentleness in many a ride To pond, or field, or Village-fair, when thou Held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow; And oft the Tale shall rise to homely fame Upon thy gen'rous spirit and thy name. Though faithful to a proverb we regard The midnight Chieftain of the farmer's yard, Beneath whose guardianship all hearts rejoice, Woke by the echo of his hollow voice; Yet as the Hound may fault'ring quit the pack, Snuff the foul scent, and hasten yelping back; And e'en the docile Pointer know disgrace, Thwarting the gen'ral instinct of his race; E'en so the Mastiff, or the meaner Cur, At time will from the path of duty err, (A pattern of fidelity by day: By night a murderer, lurking for his prey;) And round the pastures or the fold will creep, And, coward-like, attack the peaceful sheep. Alone the wanton mischief he pursues, Alone in reeking blood his jaws imbrues; Chasing amain his frighten'd victims round, Till death in wild confusion strews the ground; Then wearied out, to kennel sneaks away, And licks his guilty paws till break of day. The deed discover'd, and the news once spread, Vengeance hangs o'er the unknown culprit's head; And careful Shepherds extra hours bestow In patient watchings for the common foe; A foe most dreaded now, when rest and peace Should wait the season of the flock's increase. In part these nightly terrors to dispel, Giles, ere he sleeps, his little flock must tell. From the fire-side with many a shrug he hies, Glad if the full-orb'd Moon salute his eyes, And through th' unbroken stillness of the night Shed on his path her beams of cheering light. With saunt'ring step he climbs the distant stile, Whilst all around him wears a placid smile; There views the white-rob'd clouds in clusters driven, And all the glorious pageantry of Heaven. Low, on the utmost bound'ry of the sight, The rising vapours catch the silver light; Thence Fancy measures, as they parting fly, Which first will throw its shadow on the eye, Passing the source of light; and thence away, Succeeded quick by brighter still than they. Far yet above these wafted clouds are seen (In a remoter sky, still more serene,) Others, detach'd in ranges through the air, Spotless as snow, and countless as they're fair, Scatter'd immensely wide from east to west, The beauteous 'semblance of a Flock at rest. These, to the raptur'd mind, aloud proclaim Their mighty Shepherd's everlasting Name. Whilst thus the loit'rer's utmost stretch of soul Climbs the still clouds, or passes those that roll, And loos'd Imagination soaring goes High o'er his home, and all his little woes, Time glides away; neglected Duty calls; At once from plains of light to earth he falls, And down a narrow lane, well known by day, With all his speed pursues his sounding way, In thought still half absorb'd, and chill'd with cold, When lo! an object frightful to behold; A grisly Spectre, cloth'd in silver-grey, Around whose feet the waving shadows play, Stands in his path!âHe stops, and not a breath Heaves from his heart, that sinks almost to death. Loud the Owl halloos o'er his head unseen; All else is silent, dismally serene: Some prompt ejaculation, whisper'd low, Yet bears him up against the threat'ning foe; And thus poor Giles, though half inclin'd to fly,â Mutters his doubts, and strains his stedfast eye. â'Tis not my crimes thou com'st here to reprove; âNo murders stain my soul, no perjur'd love: âIf thou'rt indeed what here thou seem'st to be, âThy dreadful mission cannot reach to me. âBy parents taught still to mistrust mine eyes, âStill to approach each object of surprise, âLest Fancy's formful visions should deceive âIn moon-light paths, or glooms of falling eve, âThis then's the moment when my mind should try âTo scan thy motionless deformity; âBut oh, the fearful task! yet well I know âAn aged Ash, with many a spreading bough, â(Beneath whose leaves I've found a Summer's bow'r, âBeneath whose trunk I've weather'd many a show'r,) âStands singly down this solitary way, âBut far beyond where now my footsteps stay. â'Tis true, thus far I've come with heedless haste; âNo reck'ning kept, no passing objects trac'd:â âAnd can I then have reach'd that very tree? âOr is its reverend form assum'd by thee?â The happy thought alleviates his pain: He creeps another step; then stops again; Till slowly, as his noiseless feet draw near, Its perfect lineaments at once appear; Its crown of shiv'ring ivy whispering peace, And its white bark that fronts the moon's pale face. Now, whilst his blood mounts upward, now he knows The solid gain that from conviction flows; And strengthen'd Confidence shall hence fulfil (With conscious Innocence more valued still) The dreariest task that winter nights can bring, By church-yard dark, or grove, or fairy ring; Still buoying up the timid-mind of youth, Till loit'ring Reason hoists the scale of Truth. With these blest guardians Giles his eourse pursues, Till numbering his heavy-sided ewes, Surrounding stillness tranquillize his breast, And shape the dreams that wait his hours of rest. As when retreating tempests we behold, Whose skirts at length the azure sky unfold, And full of murmurings and mingled wrath, Slowly unshroud the smiling face of earth, Bringing the bosom joy: so Winter flies!â And see the Source of Life and Light uprise! A height'ning arch o'er southern hills he bends; Warm on the cheek the slanting beam descends, And gives the reeking mead a brighter hue, And draws the modest primrose bud to view. Yet frosts succeed, and winds impetuous rush, And hail-storms rattle through the budding bush; And nigh-fall'n Lambs require the shepherd's care. And teeming Ewes, that still their burdens bear; Beneath whose sides to-morrow's dawn may see The milk-white strangers bow the trembling knee; At whose first birth the pow'rful instinct's seen That fills with champions the daisied green: For Ewes that stood aloof with fearful eye, With stamping foot now Men and Dogs defy, And obstinately faithful to their young, Guard their first steps to join the bleating throng. But casualties and death from damps and cold Will still attend the well-conducted fold: Her tender offspring dead, the Dam aloud Calls, and runs wild amidst th' unconscious crowd: And orphan'd sucldings raise the piteous cry; No wool to warm them, no defenders nigh. And must her streaming milk then flow in vain? Must unregarded innocence complain? No;âere this strong solicitude subside, Maternal fondness may be fresh apply'd, And the adopted stripling still may find A parent most assiduously kind. For this he's doom'd awhile disguis'd to range, (For fraud or force must work the wish'd-for change;) For this his predecessor's skin he wears, Till, cheated into tenderness and cares, The unsuspecting dam, contented grown, Cherish and guard the fondling as her own. Thus all by turns to fair perfection rise; Thus twins are parted to increase their size: Thus instinct yields as interest points the way, Till the bright flock, augmenting every day; On sunny hills and vales of springing flow'rs With ceaseless clamour greet the vernal hours. The humbler Shepherd here with joy beholds Th approv'd economy of crowded folds, And, in his small contracted round of cares, Adjusts the practice of each hint he hears. For Boys with emulation learn to glow, And boast their pastures, and their healthful show Of well-grown Lambs, the glory of the Spring; And field to field in competition bring. E'en Giles, for all his cares and watchings past, And all his contests with the wintry blast, Claims a full share of that sweet praise bestow'd By gazing neighbours, when along the road, Or village green, his curly-coated throng Suspends the chorus of the Spinner's song; When Admiration's unaffected grace Lisps from the tongue, and beams in ev'ry face: Delightful moments!âSunshine, Health, and Joy, Play round, and cheer the elevated Boy! âAnother Spring!â his heart exulting cries; âAnother Year! with promis'd blessings rise!â âEternal Power! from whom those blessings flow, âTeach me still more to wonder, more to know: âSeed-time and Harvest let me see again; âWander the leaf-strewn wood, the frozen plain: âLet the first flower, corn-waving field, plain, tree, âHere round my home, still lift my soul to thee; âAnd let me ever, midst thy bounties, raise âAn humble note of thankfulness and praise!ââ April 22, 1798. GOOD TIDINGS; OR, NEWS FROM THE FARM How vain this tribute; vain this lowly lay; Yet nought is vain which gratitude inspires! The Muse, besides, her duty thus approves To virtue, to her country, to mankind! THOMSON. Where's the Blind Child, so admirably fair, With guileless dimples, and with flaxen hair That waves in ev'ry breeze? he's often seen Beside yon cottage wall, or on the green, With others match'd in spirit and in size, Health on their cheeks, and rapture in their eyes; That full expanse of voice, to childhood dear, Soul of their sports, is duly cherish'd here; And, hark! that laugh is his, that jovial cry; He hears the ball and trundling hoop brush by, And runs the giddy course with all his might, A very child in every thing but sight; With circumscrib'd, but not abated pow'rs,â Play! the great object of his infant hours;â In many a game he takes a noisy part, And shows the native gladness of his heart; But soon he hears, on pleasure all intent, The new suggestion and the quick assent; The grove invites, delight thrills every breastâ To leap the ditch and seek the downy nest Away they start, leave balls and hoops behind, And one companion leaveâthe boy is blind! His fancy paints their distant paths so gay, That childish fortitude awhile gives way, He feels his dreadful lossâyet short the pain, Soon he resumes his cheerfulness again; Pond'ring how best his moments to employ, He sings his little songs of nameless joy, Creeps on the warm green turf for many an hour, And plucks by chance the white and yellow flow'r; Smoothing their stems, while resting on his knees, He binds a nosegay which he never sees; Along the homeward path then feels his way, Lifting his brow against the shining day, And, with a playful rapture round his eyes, Presents a sighing parent with the prize. She blest that day, which he remembers too, When he could gaze on heav'n's ethereal blue, See the green Spring, and Summer's countless dies, And all the colours of the morning rise.â âWhen was this work of bitterness begun? âHow came the blindness of your only son?â Thus pity prompts full many a tongue to say, But never, till she slowly wipes away Th' obtruding tear that trembles in her eye, This dagger of a question meets reply:â âMy boy was healthy, and my rest was sound, âWhen last year's corn was green upon the ground: âFrom yonder town infection found its way; âAround me putrid dead and dying lay. âI trembled for his fate: but all my care âAvail'd not, for he breath'd the tainted air; âSickness ensu'dâin terror and dismay âI nurs'd him in my arms both night and day, âWhen his soft skin from head to foot became âOne swelling purple sore, unfit to name: âHour after hour, when all was still beside, âWhen the pale night-light in its socket died, âAlone I sat; the thought still sooths my heart, âThat surely I perform'd a mother's part, âWatching with such anxiety and pain âTill he might smile and look on me again; âBut that was not to beâask me no more: âGod keep small-pox and blindness from your door!â Now, ye who think, whose souls abroad take wing, And trace out human troubles to their spring, Say, should Heav'n grant us, in some hallow'd hour, Means to divest this demon of his power, To loose his horrid grasp from early worth, To spread a saving conquest round the earth, Till ev'ry land shall bow the grateful knee, Would it not be a glorious day to see?â That day is come! my soul, in strength arise, Invoke no muse, no power below the skies; To Heav'n the energies of verse belong, Truth is the theme, and truth shall be the song; Arm with conviction every joyful line, Source of all mercies, for the praise is thine! Sweet beam'd the star of peace upon those days When Virtue watch'd my childhood's quiet ways, Whence a warm spark of Nature's holy flame Gave the farm-yard an honourable name, But left one theme unsung: then, who had seen In herds that feast upon the vernal green, Or dreamt that in the blood of kine there ran Blessings beyond the sustenance of man? We tread the meadow, and we scent the thorn, We hail the day-spring of a summer's morn; Nor mead at dawning day, nor thymy heath, Transcends the fragrance of the heifer's breath: May that dear fragrance, as it floats along O'er ev'ry flow'r that lives in rustic song; May all the sweets of meadows and of kine Embalm, O Health! this offering at thy shrine. Dear must that moment be when first the mind, Ranging the paths of science unconfin'd, Strikes a new light; when, obvious to the sense, Springs the fresh spark of bright intelligence. So felt the towering soul of Montagu, Her sex's glory, and her country's too; Who gave the spotted plague one deadly blow, And bade its mitigated poison flow With half its terrors; yet, with loathing still, We hous'd a visitant with pow'r to kill. Then when the healthful blood, though often tried, Foil'd the keen lancet by the Severn side, Resisting, uncontaminated still, The purple pest and unremitting skill; When the plain truth tradition seem'd to know, By simply pointing to the harmless Cow, Though wise distrust to reason might appeal; What, when hope triumph'd, what did Jenner feel! Where even hope itself could scarcely rise To scan the vast, inestimable prize! Perhaps supreme, alone, triumphant stood The great, the conscious power of doing good, The power to will, and wishes to embrace Th' emancipation of the human race; A joy that must all mortal praise outlive, A wealth that grateful nations cannot give. Forth sped the truth immediate from his hand, And confirmations sprung in ev'ry land; In ev'ry land, on beauty's lily arm, On infant softness, like a magic charm, Appear'd the gift that conquers as it goes; The dairy's boast, the simple, saving Rose! Momentous triumphâfiend! thy reign is o'er; Thou, whose blind rage hath ravag'd ev'ry shore, Whose name denotes destruction, whose foul breath For ever hov'ring round the dart of death, Fells, mercilessly fells, the brave and base, Through all the kindreds of the human race. Who has not heard, in warm, poetic tales, Of eastern fragrance and Arabian gales? Bowers of delight, of languor, and repose, Where beauty triumph'd as the song arose? Fancy may revel, fiction boldly dare, But truth shall not forget that thou wert there, Scourge of the world! who, borne on ev'ry wind, From bow'rs of roses The first medical account of the small-pox is given by the Arabian physicians, and is traced no farther back than the siege of Alexandria, about the year of Christ 640.âWoodville. sprang to curse mankind.

He adds, about fifty years after the discovery of Peru, the small-pox was carried over from Europe to America by way of Carthagena, when it overran the Continent of the New World, and destroyed upwards of 100,000 Indians in the single province of Quito.âHist. of Inoculation.. But why unskill'd th' historic page explore? Why thus pursue thee to a foreign shore? A homely narrative of days gone by, Familiar griefs, and kindred's tender sigh, Shall still survive; for thou on ev'ry mind Hast left some traces of thy wrath behind. There dwelt, beside a brook that creeps along Midst infant hills and meads unknown to song, One to whom poverty and faith were giv'n, Calm village silence, and the hope of heav'n: Alone she dwelt; and while each morn brought peace, And health was smiling on her years' increase, Sudden and fearful, rushing through her frame, Unusual pains and feverish symptoms came. Then, when debilitated, faint, and poor, How sweet to hear a footsep at her door! To see a neighbour watch life's silent sand, To hear the sigh, and feel the helping hand! Soon woe o'erspread the interdicted ground, And consternation seiz'd the hamlets round: Uprose the pestâits widow'd victim died; And foul contagion spread on ev'ry side; The helping neighbour, for her kind regard, Bore home that dreadful tribute of reward, Home, where six children, yielding to its pow'r, Gave hope and patience a most trying hour; One at her breast still drew the living stream, And sense of danger never marr'd his dream; Yet all exclaim'd, and with a pitying eye, âWhoe'er survives the shock, that child will die!â But vain the fiat,âHeav'n restor'd them all, And destin'd one of riper years to fall. Midnight beheld the close of all his pain, His grave was clos'd when midnight came again; No bell was heard to toll, no funeral pray'r, No kindred bow'd, no wife, no children there; Its horrid nature could inspire a dread That cut the bonds of custom like a thread. The humble church-tow'r higher seem'd to show, Illumin'd by their trembling light below; The solemn night-breeze struck each shiv'ring cheek; Religious reverence forbade to speak: The starting Sexton his short sorrow chid When the earth murmur'd on the coffin lid, And falling bones and sighs of holy dread Sounded a requiem to the silent dead! âWhy tell us tales of woe, thou who didst give âThy soul to rural themes, and bade them live? âWhat means this zeal of thine, this kindling fire? âThe rescu'd infant and the dying sire?â Kind heart, who o'er the pictur'd Seasons glow'd, When smiles approv'd the verse, or tears have flow'd, Was then the lowly minstrel dear to thee? Himself appealsâWhat, if that child were he! What, if those midnight sighs a farewell gave, While hands, all trembling, clos'd his father's grave Though love enjoin'd not infant eyes to weep, In manhood's zenith shall his feelings sleep? Sleep not, my soul! indulge a nobler flame; Still the destroyer persecutes thy name. Sev'n winters cannot pluck from mem'ry's store That mark'd affliction which a brother bore; That storm of trouble bursting on his head, When the fiend came, and left two children dead! Yet, still superior to domestic woes, The native vigour of his mind arose, And, as new summers teem'd with brighter views, He trac'd the wand'rings of his darling Muse, And all was joyâthis instant all is pain, The foe implacable returns again, And claims a sacrifice; the deed is doneâ Another child has fall'n, another son I had proceeded thus far with the Poem, when the above fact become a powerful stimulus to my feelings, and to the earnestness of my exhortation! His young cheek even now is scarcely cold, And shall his early doom remain untold? No! let the tide of passion roll along, Truth will be heard, and God will bless the song. Indignant Reason, Pity, Joy, arise, And speak in thunder to the heart that sighs. Speak loud to parents;âknew ye not the time When age itself, and manhood's hardy prime, With horror saw their short-liv'd friendships end, Yet dar'd not visit e'en the dying friend? Contagion, a foul serpent lurking near, Mock'd Nature's sigh and Friendship's holy tear. Love ye your children?âlet that love arise, Pronounce the sentence, and the serpent dies; Bid welcome a mild stranger at your door, Distress shall cease, those terrors reign no more. Love ye your neighbours?âlet that love be shown; Risk not their children while you guard your own; Give not a foe dominion o'er your blood, Plant not a poison, e'en to bring forth good; For, woo the pest discreetly as you will, Deadly infection must attend him still. Then, let the serpent die! this glorious prize Sets more than life and health before our eyes, For beauty triumphs too! Beauty! sweet name, The mother's feelings kindling into flame! For, where dwells she, who, while the virtues grow, With cold indifference marks the arching brow? Or, with a lifeless heart and recreant blood, Sighs not for daughters fair as well as good? That sigh is nature, and cannot decay, 'Tis universal as the beams of day; Man knows and feels its truth; for, Beauty's call Rouses the coldest mortal of us all; A glance warms age itself, and gives the boy The pulse of rapture, and the sigh of joy, And is it then no conquest to insure Our lilies spotless and our roses pure? Is it no triumph that the lovely face Inherits every line of Nature's grace? That the sweet precincts of the laughing eye Dread no rude scars, no foul deformity? Our boast, old Time himself shall not impair, Of British maids pre-eminently fair; But, as he rolls his years on years along, Shall keep the record of immortal song; For song shall rise with ampler power to speak The new-born influence of Beauty's cheek, Shall catch new fires in every sacred grove, Fresh inspiration from the lips of Love, And write for ever on the rising mindâ Dead is one mortal foe of human kind! Yes, we have conquer'd! and the thought should raise A spirit in our prayers as well as praise, For who will say, in Nature's wide domain There lurk not remedies for every pain; Who will assert, where Turkish banners fly, Woe still shall reignâthe plague shall never die? Or who predict, with bosom all unblest, An everlasting fever in the West? Forbid it, Heav'n!âHope cheers us with a smile, The sun of Mercy's risen on our isle: Its beams already, o'er th' Atlantic wave, Pierce the dark forests of the suffering brave: There, e'en th' abandon'd sick imbib'd a glow, When warrior nations, resting on the bow, Astonish'd heard the joyful rumour rise, And call'd the council of their great and wise: The truth by female pray'rs was urg'd along, Youth ceas'd the chorus of the warrior song, And present ills bade present feelings press With all the eloquence of deep distress; Till forth their chiefs The chiefs of the Cherokee Indians, in North America, have applied to the government of the United States for information on the subject of Vaccine Inoculation, and have spread the practice in the Woods o'er dying thousands trod To seek the white man and his bounteous God: Well sped their errand; with a patriot zeal They spread the blessing for their country's weal. Where India's swarthy millions crowd the strand, And round that isle, which crowns their pointed land, Speeds the good angel with the balmy breath, And checks the dreadful tyranny of death: Whate'er we hear to hurt the peace of life, Of Candian treachery and British strife, The sword of commerce, nations bought and sold, They owe to England more than mines of gold; England has sent a balm for private woe; England strikes down the nation's bitterest foe. Europe, amidst the clangor of her arms, While life was threaten'd with a thousand harms, And Charity was freezing to its source, Still saw fair Science keep her steady course; And, while whole legions fell, by friends deplor'd, New germs of life sprung up beneath the sword, And spread amain.âThen, in our bosoms, why Must exultation mingle with a sigh? Thought takes the retrospect of years just fled, And, conjuring up the spirits of the dead, Whispers each dear and venerated name Of the last victims ere the blessing came, Worthies, who through the lands that gave them birth Breath'd the strong evidence of growing worth; Parents, cut down in life's meridian day, And childhood's thousand thousand swept away; Life's luckless mariners! ye, we deplore Who sunk within a boat's length of the shore So lately as the year 1793, the small-pox was carried to the Isle of France by a Dutch ship, and there destroyed five thousand four hundred persons in six weeks.âWoodville.. A stranger youth, from his meridian sky, Buoyant with hopes, came hereâbut came to die! O'er his sad fate I've ponder'd hours away, It suits the languor of a gloomy day: He left his bamboo groves, his pleasant shore, He left his friends to hear new oceans roar, All confident, ingenuous, and bold, He heard the wonders by the white men told; With firm assurance trod the rolling deck, And saw his isle diminish to a speck, Plough'd the rough waves, and gain'd our northern elime, In manhood's ripening sense and nature's prime. Oh! had the fiend been vanquish'd ere he came, The gen'rous youth had spread my country's fame, Had known that honour dwells among the brave, And England had not prov'd the stranger's grave: Then, ere his waning sand of life had run, Poor Abba Thule might have seen his son! Lee Boo, second son of the King of the Pelew Islands, was brought to England by Capt. Wilson, and died of the Small-pox, at Rotherhithe, in 1784. Rise, exultation! spirit, louder speak! Pity, dislodge thy dew-drops from my cheek: Sleep sound, forefathers; sleep, brave stranger boy, While truth impels the current of my joy: To all mankind, to all the earth 'tis giv'n, Conviction travels like the light of heav'n: Go, blessing, from thy birth-place still expand, For that dear birth-place is my native land! A nation consecrates th' auspicious day, And wealth, and rank, and talents lead the way! Time, with triumphant hand, shall truth diffuse, Nor ask the unbought efforts of the Muse. Mothers! the pledges of your loves caress, And heave no sighs but sighs of tenderness. Fathers, be firm! keep down the fallen foe, And on the mem'ry of domestic woe Build resolution.âVictory shall increase Th' incalculable wealth of private peace; And such a victory, unstain'd with gore, That strews its laurels at the cottage door, Sprung from the farm, and from the yellow mead, Should be the glory of the pastoral reed. In village paths, hence, may we never find Their youth on crutches, and their children blind; Nor, when the milk-maid, early from her bed, Beneath the may-bush that embow'rs her head, Sings like a bird, e'er grieve to meet again The fair cheek injur'd by the scars of pain; Pure, in her morning path, where'er she treads, Like April sunshine and the flow'rs it feeds, She'll boast new conquests; Love, new shafts to fling And Life, an uncontaminated spring. In pure delight didst thou, my soul, pursue A task to conscience and to kindred due, And, true to feeling and to Nature, deem The dairy's boast thine own appropriate theme; Hail now the meed of pleasurable hours, And, at the foot of Science, strew thy flow'rs!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. RURAL TALES, AND WILD FLOWERS. RURAL TALES. RICHARD AND KATE; OR, FAIR-DAY. A SUFFOLK BALLAD. I âCome, Goody, stop your humdrum wheel, âSweep up your orts, and get your hat; âOld joys reviv'd once more I feel, â'Tis Fair-day;âay, and more than that. II âHave you forgot, Kate, prithee say, âHow many Seasons here we've tarried? âTis Forty years, this very day, âSince you and I, old Girl, were married! III âLook out; the Sun shines warm and bright, âThe Stiles are low, the Paths all dry; âI know you cut your corns last night: âCome; be as free from care as I. IV âFor I'm resolv'd once more to see âThat place where we so often met; âThough few have had more cares than we, âWe've none just now to make us fret.â V Kate scorn'd to damp the generous flame That warm'd her aged Partner's breast: Yet, ere determination came, She thus some trifling doubts express'd: VI âNight will come on; when seated snug, âAnd you've perhaps begun some tale, âCan you then leave your dear stone mug; âLeave all the folks, and all the ale?â VII âAy, Kate, I wool;âbecause I know, âThough time has been we both could run, âSuch days are gone and over now;â âI only mean to see the fun.â VIII She straight slipp'd off the Wall and Band, And laid aside her Lucks and Twitches: And to the Hutch she reach'd her hand, And gave him out his Sunday Breeches. IX His Mattock he behind the door And Hedging-gloves again replac'd; And look'd across the yellow Moor, And urg'd his tott'ring Spouse to haste. X The day was up, the air serene, The Firmament without a cloud; The Bee humm'd o'er the level green, Where knots of trembling Cowslips bow'd. XI And Richard thus, with heart elate, As past things rush'd across his mind, Over his shoulder talk'd to Kate, Who, snug tuckt up, walk'd slow behind. XII âWhen once a giggling Mawther you. âAnd I a red-fac'd chubby Boy, âSly tricks you play'd me not a few; âFor mischief was your greatest joy. XIII âOnce, passing by this very Tree, âA Gotch of Milk I'd been to fill, âYou shoulder'd me; then laugh'd to see âMe and my Gotch spin down the Hill.â XIV â'Tis true,â she said; âBut here behold, âAnd marvel at the course of Time; âThough you and I are both grown old, âThis Tree is only in its prime!â XV âWell, Goody, don't stand preaching now; âFolks don't preach Sermons at a Fair: âWe've rear'd Ten Boys and Girls you know; âAnd I'll be bound they'll all be there.â XVI Now friendly nods and smiles had they, From many a kind Fair-going face: And many a pinch Kate gave away, While Richard kept his usual pace. XVII At length arriv'd amidst the throng, Grand-children bawling hemm'd them round; And dragg'd them by the skirts along Where gingerbread bestrew'd the ground. XVIII And soon the aged couple spy'd Their lusty Sons, and Daughters dear:â When Richard thus exulting cried, âDid'nt I tell you they'd be here?â XIX The cordial greetings of the soul Were visible in every face: Affection, void of all controul, Govern'd with a resistless grace. XX 'Twas good to see the honest strife, Which should contribute most to please; And hear the long-recounted life, Of infant tricks, and happy days. XXI But now, as at some nobler places, Amongst the Leaders 'twas decreed Time to begin the Dicky Races; More fam'd for laughter than for speed. XXII Richard look'd on with wond'rous glee, And prais'd the Lad who chanc'd to win; âKate, wa'n't I such a one as he? âAs like him, ay, as pin to pin.â XXIII âFull Fifty years are pass'd away âSince I rode this same ground about; âLord! I was lively as the day! âI won the High-lows out and out!â XXIV âI'm surely growing young again: âI feel myself so kedge and plump. âFrom head to foot I've not one pain; âNay, hang me if I cou'dn't jump.â XXV Thus spoke the Ale in Richard's pate, A very little made him mellow; But still he lov'd his faithful Kate, Who whisper'd thus, âMy good old fellow,â XXVI âRemember what you promis'd me âAnd see, the Sun is getting low; âThe Children want an hour ye see âTo talk a bit before we go.â XXVII Like youthful Lover most complying He turn'd, and chuckt her by the chin: Then all across the green grass hying, Right merry faces, all akin. XXVIII Their farewell quart, beneath a tree That droop'd its branches from above, Awak'd the pure felicity That waits upon Parental Love. XXIX Kate view'd her blooming Daughters round, And Sons, who shook her wither'd hand: Her features spoke what joy she found; But utterance had made a stand. XXX The Children toppied on the green, And bowl'd their fairings down the hill; Richard with pride beheld the scene, Nor could he for his life sit still. XXXI A Father's uncheck'd feelings gave A tenderness to all he said; âMy Boys, how proud am I to have âMy name thus round the country spread! XXXII âThrough all my days I've labour'd hard, âAnd could of pains and crosses tell; âBut this is Labour's great reward, âTo meet ye thus, and see ye well.â XXXIII âMy good old Partner, when at home, âSometimes with wishes mingles tears; âGoody, says I, let what wool come, âWe've nothing for them but our pray'rs. XXXIV âMay you be all as old as I, âAnd see your Sons to manhood grow; âAnd, many a time before you die, âBe just as pleas'd as I am now.â XXXV Then, (raising still his Mug and Voice,) âAn Old Man's weakness don't despise! âI love you well, my Girls and Boys; âGod bless you all;ââso said his eyesâ XXXVI For as he spoke, a big round drop Fell, bounding on his ample sleeve; A witness which he could not stop, A witness which all hearts believe. XXXVII Thou, Filial Piety, wert there; And round the ring, benignly bright, Dwelt in the luscious half-shed tear, And in the parting wordâGood Night! XXXVIII With thankful Hearts and strengthen'd Love, The poor old Pair, supremely blest, Saw the Sun sink behind the grove, And gain'd once more their lowly rest. WALTER AND JANE; OR, THE POOR BLACKSMITH. A COUNTRY TALE. Bright was the summer sky, the mornings gay, And Jane was young and cheerful as the Day. Not yet to Love but Mirth she paid her vows; And Echo mock'd her as she call'd her Cows. Tufts of green Broom, that full in blossom vied, And grac'd with spotted gold the upland side, The level fogs o'erlook'd; too high to share; So lovely Jane o'erlook'd the clouds of Care; No meadow-flow'r rose fresher to the view, That met her morning footsteps in the dew; Where, if a nodding stranger ey'd her charms, The blush of innocence was up in arms, Love's random glances struck th' unguarded mind, And Beauty's magic made him look behind. Duly as morning blush'd or twilight came, Secure of greeting smiles and Village fame, She pass'd the Straw-roof'd Shed, in ranges where Hung many a well-turn'd Shoe and glitt'ring Share, Where Walter, as the charmer tripp'd along, Would stop his roaring Bellows and his Song.â Dawn of affection; Love's delicious sigh! Caught from the lightnings of a speaking eye, That lead'st the heart to rapture or to woe, 'Twas Walter's fate thy madd'ning power to know And scarce to know, ere in its infant twine, As the Blast shakes the tendrils of the Vine, The budding bliss that full of promise grew The chilling blight of separation knew. Scarce had he told his heart's unquiet case, And Jane to shun him ceas'd to mend her pace, And learnt to listen trembling as he spoke, And fondly judge his words beyond a joke; When, at the Goal that bounds our prospects here, Jane's widow'd Mistress ended her career: Blessings attended her divided store, The Mansion sold, (Jane's peaceful home no more,) A distant village own'd her for its Queen, Another service, and another scene; But could another scene so pleasing prove, Twelve weary miles from Walter and from Love? The Maid grew thoughtful: yet to Fate resign'd, Knew not the worth of what she'd left behind. He, when at eve releas'd from toil and heat, Soon miss'd the smiles that taught his heart to beat, Each sabbath-day of late was wont to prove Hope's liberal feast, the holiday of Love: But now, upon his spirit's ebbing strength Came each dull hour's intolerable length. The next had scarcely dawn'd when Walter hied O'er hill and dale, Affection for his guide: O'er the brown Heath his pathless journey lay, Where screaming Lapwings hail'd the op'ning day. High rose the Sun, the anxious Lover sigh'd; His slipp'ry soles bespoke the dew was dried: Her last farewell hung fondly on his tongue As o'er the tufted Furze elate he sprung; Trifling impediments; his heart was light, For Love and Beauty glow'd in fancy's sight; And soon he gaz'd on Jane's enchanting face, Renew'd his passion,âbut destroy'd his peace. Truth, at whose shrine he bow'd, inflicted pain; And Conscience whisper'd, ânever come again.â For now, his tide of gladness to oppose, A clay-cold damp of doubts and fears arose; Clouds, which involve, midst Love and Reason's strife, The poor man's prospect when he takes a wife. Though gay his journeys in the Summer's prime, Each seem'd the repetition of a crime; He never left her but with many a sigh, When tears stole down his face, she knew not why Severe his task those visits to forego, And feed his heart with voluntary woe, Yet this he did; the wan Moon circling found His evenings cheerless, and his rest unsound; And saw th' unquenched flame his bosom swell: What were his doubts, thus let the Story tell. A month's sharp conflict only serv'd to prove The pow'r, as well as truth, of Walter's love. Absence more strongly on his mind pourtray'd His own sweet, injur'd, unoffending Maid. Once more he'd go; full resolute awhile, But heard his native bells on every stile; The sound recall'd him with a pow'rful charm, The Heath wide open'd, and the day was warm; There, where a bed of tempting green he found, Increasing anguish weigh'd him to the ground; His well-grown limbs the scatter'd Daisies press'd, While his clinch'd hand fell heavy on his breast. âWhy do I go in cruel sport to say, âI love thee, Jane, appoint the happy day?â âWhy seek her sweet ingenuous reply, âThen grasp her hand and profferâpoverty? âWhy, if I love her and adore her name, âWhy act like time and sickness on her frame! âWhy should my scanty pittance nip her prime, âAnd chase away the Rose before its time? âI'm young, 'tis true; the world beholds me free, âLabour ne'er show'd a frightful face to me; âNature's first wants hard labour should supply; âBut should it fail, 'twill be too late to fly. âSome Summers hence, if nought our loves annoy, âThe image of my Jane may lisp her joy; âOr, blooming boys with imitative swing âMay mock my arm, and make the Anvil ring; âThen if in ragsâBut, O my heart, forbear,â âI love the Girl, and why should I despair? âAnd that I love her all the village knows; âOft from my pain the mirth of others flows; âAs when a neighbour's Steed with glancing eye âSaw his par'd hoof supported on my thigh: âJane pass'd that instant; mischief came of course; âI drove the nail awry and lam'd the Horse; âThe poor beast limp'd: I bore a Master's frown, âA thousand times I wish'd the wound my own. âWhen to these tangling thoughts I've been resign'd, âFury or languor has possess'd my mind, âAll eyes have star'd, I've blown a blast so strong; âForgot to smite at all, or smote too long. âIf at the Ale-house door, with careless glee, âOne drinks to Jane, and darts a look on me; âI feel that blush which her dear name will bring, âI feel:âbut, guilty Love, 'tis not thy sting! âYet what are jeers? the bubbles of an hour; âJane knows what Love can do, and feels its pow'r; âIn her mild eye fair Truth her meaning tells; â'Tis not in looks like hers that falsehood dwells. âAs water shed upon a dusty way âI've seen midst downward pebbles devious stray; âIf kindred drops an adverse channel keep, âThe crystal friends toward each other creep; âNear, and still nearer, rolls each little tide, âTh' expanding mirror swells on either side: âThey touchâ'tis doneâreceding bound'ries fly, âAn instantaneous union strikes the eye: âSo 'tis with us: for Jane would be my bride; âShall coward fears then turn the bliss aside?â While thus he spoke he heard a gentle sound, That seem'd a jarring footstep on the ground: Asham'd of grief, he bade his eyes unclose, And shook with agitation as he rose; All unprepar'd the sweet surprise to bear, His heart beat high, for Jane herself was there.â Flusht was her cheek; she seem'd the full-blown flower For warmth gave loveliness a double power; Round her fair brow the deep confusion ran, A waving handkerchief became her fan, Her lips, where dwelt sweet love and smiling ease Puff'd gently back the warm assailing breeze. âI've travell'd all these weary miles with pain, âTo see my native village once again; âAnd show my true regard for neighbour Hind: âNot like you, Walter, she was always kind.â 'Twas thus, each soft sensation laid aside, She buoy'd her spirits up with maiden pride; Disclaim'd her love, e'en while she felt the sting; âWhat, come for Walter's sake!â 'Twas no such thing. But when astonishment his tongue releas'd, Pride's usurpation in an instant ceas'd: By force he caught her hand as passing by, And gaz'd upon her half-averted eye; His heart's distraction, and his boding fears She heard, and answer'd with a flood of tears; Precious relief; sure friends that forward press To tell the mind's unspeakable distress. Ye Youths, whom crimson'd health and genuine fire Bear joyous on the wings of young desire, Ye, who still bow to Love's almighty sway, What could true passion, what could Walter say? Age, tell me true, nor shake your locks in vain, Tread back your paths, and be in love again; In your young days did such a favouring hour Show you the littleness of Wealth and Pow'r, Advent'rous climbers of the Mountain's brow, While Love, their master, spreads his couch below. âMy dearest Jane,â the untaught Walter cried, As, half repell'd, he pleaded by her side; âMy dearest Jane, think of me as you mayââ Thusâstill unutter'd what he strove to say, They breath'd in sighs the anguish of their minds, And took the path that led to neighbour Hind's. A secret joy the well-known roof inspir'd, Small was its store, and little they desir'd; Jane dried her tears; while Walter forward flew, To aid the Dame; who to the brink updrew The pond'rous Bucket as they reach'd the well, And scarcely with exhausted breath could tell How welcome to her Cot the blooming Pair, O'er whom she watch'd with a maternal care. âWhat ails thee, Jane?â the wary Matron cried, With heaving breast the modest Maid reply'd, Now gently moving back her wooden Chair To shun the current of the cooling air; âNot much, good Dame; I'm weary by the way; âPerhaps, anon, I've something else to say.â Now, while the Seed-cake crumbled on her knee, And Snowy Jessamine peep'd in to see; And the transparent Lilac at the door, Full to the Sun its purple honors bore, The clam'rous Hen her fearless brood display'd, And march'd around; while thus the Matron said: âJane has been weeping, Walter;âprithee why? âI've seen her laugh, and dance, but never cry. âBut I can guess; with her you should have been, âWhen late I saw you loit'ring on the green; I'm an old Woman, and the truth may tell; âI say then, Boy, you have not us'd her well.â Jane felt for Walter; shar'd his cruel pain, And Pity urg'd her e'en to tears again. âDon't scold him, Neighbour, he has much to say, âIndeed he came and met me by the way.â The Dame resum'dââWhy then, my Children, why âDo such young bosoms heave the piteous sigh? âThe ills of Life to you are yet unknown; âDeath's sev'ring shaft, and Poverty's cold frown: âI've felt them both by turns;âbut as they pass'd, âStrong was my trust, and here I am at last. âWhen I dwelt young and cheerful down the Lane â(And, though I say it, I was much like Jane,) âO'er flow'ry fields with Hind, I lov'd to stray, âAnd talk, and laugh, and fool the time away: âAnd Care defied; who not one pain could give, âTill the thought came of how we were to live; âAnd then Love plied his arrows thicker still: âAnd prov'd victorious:âas he always will. âWe brav'd Life's storm together; while that Drone, âYour poor old Uncle, Walter, liv'd alone. âHe died the other day: when round his bed âNo tender soothing tear Affection shedâ âAffection! 'twas a plant he never knew;â âWhy should he feast on fruits he never grew? Walter caught fire: nor was he charm'd alone With conscious Truth's firm elevated tone; Jane from her seat sprang forward, half afraid, Attesting with a blush what Goody said. Her Lover took a more decided part:â (O! 'twas the very Chord that touch'd his heart,)â Alive to the best feelings Man can prize, A Bridegroom's transport sparkled in his eyes; Love, conquering power, with unrestricted range, Silenc'd the arguments of Time and Change; And led his vot'ry on, and bade him view, And prize the light-wing d moments as they flew: All doubts gave way, all retrospective lore, Whence cooler Reason tortur'd him before; Comparison of times, the Lab'rer's hire, And many a truth Reflection might inspire, Sunk powerless. âDame, I am a fool,â he cried; âAlone I might have reason'd till I died. âI caus'd those tears of Jane's:âbut as they fell âHow much I felt none but ourselves can tell. âWhile dastard fears withheld me from her sight, âSighs reign'd by day and hideous dreams by night; â'Twas then the Soldier's plume and rolling Drum âSeem'd for a while to strike my sorrows dumb; âTo fly from Care then half resolv'd I stood, âAnd without horror mus'd on fields of blood, âBut Hope prevail'd.âBe then the sword resign'd; âAnd I'll make Shares for those that stay behind, âAnd you, sweet Girl,ââ He would have added more, Had not a glancing shadow at the door Announc'd a guest, who bore with winning grace His well-tim'd errand pictur'd in his face. Around with silent reverence they stood; A blameless reverenceâthe man was good. Wealth he had some, a match for his desires, First on the list of active Country 'Squires. Seeing the youthful pair with downcast eyes, Unmov'd by Summer flowers and cloudless skies, Pass slowly by his Gate; his book resign'd, He watch'd their steps, and follow'd far behind, Bearing with inward joy, and bonest pride, A trust of Walter's kinsman ere he died, A hard-earn'd mite, deposited with care, And with a miser's spirit worshipp'd there. He found what oft the generous bosom seeks, In the Dame's court'sies and Jane's blushing cheeks, That consciousness of Worth, that freeborn Grace, Which waits on Virtue in the meanest place. âYoung Man, I'll not apologize to you, âNor name intrusion, for my news is true; â'Tis duty brings me here: your wants I've heard, âAnd can relieve: yet be the dead rever'd. âHere, in this Purse, (what should have cheer'd a Wife,) âLies, half the savings of your Uncle's life! âI know your history, and your wishes know; âAnd love to see the seeds of Virtue grow. âI've a spare Shed that fronts the public road, âMake that your Shop; I'll make it your abode. âThus much from me,âthe rest is but your due.â That instant twenty pieces sprung to view. Goody, her dim eyes wiping, rais'd her brow, And saw the young pair look they knew not how; Perils and Power while humble minds forego, Who gives them half a Kingdom gives them woe; Comforts may be procur'd and want defied, Heav'ns! with how small a sum, when right applied! Give Love and honest Industry their way, Clear but the Sun-rise of Life's little day, Those we term poor shall oft that wealth obtain, For which th' ambitious sigh, but sigh in vain: Wealth that still brightens, as its stores increase; The calm of Conscience, and the reign of peace Walter's enamour'd Soul, from news like this, Now felt the dawnings of his future bliss; E'en as the Red-breast shelt'ring in a bower, Mourns the short darkness of a passing Shower, Then, while the azure sky extends around, Darts on a worm that breaks the moisten'd ground, And mounts the dripping fence, with joy elate, And shares the prize triumphant with his mate. So did the Youth;âthe treasure straight became An humble servant to Love's sacred flame; Glorious subjection!âThus his silence broke: Joy gave him words; still quick'ning as he spoke. âWant was my dread, my wishes were but few; âOthers might doubt, but Jane those wishes knew âThis Gold may rid my heart of pains and sighs; âBut her true love is still my greatest prize. âLong as I live, when this bright day comes round, âBeneath my Roof your noble deeds shall sound; âBut, first, to make my gratitude appear, âI'll shoe your Honour's Horses for a Year; âIf clouds should threaten when your Corn is down, âI'll lend a hand, and summon half the town; âIf good betide, I'll sound it in my songs, âAnd be the first avenger of your wrongs: âThough rude in manners, free I hope to live: âThis Ale's not mine, no Ale have I to give; âYet, Sir, though Fortune frown'd when I was born, âLet's drink eternal friendship from this Horn. âHow much our present joy to thee we owe, âSoon our three Bells shall let the Neighbours know âThe sound shall raise e'en stooping Age awhile, âAnd every Maid shall meet you with a smile; âLong may you live'âthe wish like lightning flew; By each repeated as the 'Squire withdrew. âLong may you live,â his feeling heart rejoin'd; Leaving well pleas'd such happy Souls behind. Hope promis'd fair to cheer them to the end; With Love their guide, and Goody for their friend. THE MILLER'S MAID. A TALE. Near the High road, upon a winding stream, An honest Miller rose to Wealth and Fame: The noblest Virtues cheer'd his lengthen'd days, And all the Country echo'd with his praise: His Wife, the Doctress of the neighb'ring Poor This village and the poor of this neighbourhood know what it is to have possest such a blessing, and see at this moment what it is to lose it by death. C. L. Troston 18th of September 1801, Drew constant pray'rs and blessings round his door. One Summer's night, (the hour of rest was come) Darkness unusual overspread their home; A chilling blast was felt: the foremost cloud Sprinkl'd the bubbling Pool; and thunder loud, Though distant yet, menac'd the country round, And fill'd the Heavens with its solemn sound. Who can retire to rest when tempests lour? Nor wait the issue of the coming hour? Meekly resign'd she sat, in anxious pain; He fill'd his pipe, and listen'd to the rain That batter'd furiously their strong abode, Roar'd in the Dam, and lash'd the pebbled road: When, mingling with the storm, confus'd and wild, They heard, or thought they heard, a screaming Child The voice approach'd; and, 'midst the thunder's roar, Now loudly begg'd for Mercy at the door. Mercy was there: the Miller heard the call; His door he opened; when a sudden squall Drove in a wretched Girl; who weeping stood, Whilst the cold rain dripp'd from her in a flood, With kind officiousness the tender Dame Rous'd up the dying embers to a flame; Dry clothes procur'd, and cheer'd her shiv'ring guest, And sooth'd the sorrows of her infant breast. But as she stript her shoulders, lily-white, What marks of cruel usage shock'd their sight! Weals, and blue wounds, most piteous to behold Upon a Child yet scarcely ten years old. The Miller felt his indignation rise, Yet, as the weary stranger clos'd her eyes, And seem'd fatigu'd beyond her strength and years, âSleep, Child, (he said,) and wipe away your tears.â They watch'd her slumbers till the storm was done; When thus the generous Man again begun. âSee, flutt'ring sighs that rise against her will, âAnd agitating dreams disturb her still! âDame, we should know before we go to rest, âWhence comes this Girl, and how she came distrest. âWake her, and ask; for she is sorely bruis'd: âI long to know by whom she's thus misus'dâ âChild, what's your name? how came you in the storm? âHave you no home to keep you dry and warm; âWho gave you all those wounds your shoulders show? âWhere are your Parents? Whither would you go?â The Stranger bursting into tears, look'd pale, And this the purport of her artless tale: âI have no Parents; and no friends beside: âI well remember when my Mother died: âMy Brother cried; and so did I that day: âWe had no Father;âhe was gone away; âThat night we left our home new clothes to wear. âThe Workhouse found them; we were carried there âWe lov'd each other dearlv; when we met âWe always shar'd what trifles we could get. âBut George was older by a year than me:â âHe parted from me and was sent to Sea. âGood-bye, dear PhÅbe,â the poor fellow said: âPerhaps he'll come again; perhaps he's dead. âWhen I grew strong enough I went to place, âMy Mistress had a sour ill-natur'd face; âAnd though I've been so often beat and chid, âI strove to please her, Sir; indeed, I did. âWeary and spiritless to bed I crept, âAnd always cried at night before I slept. âThis morning I offended; and I bore âA cruel beating, worse than all before. âUnknown to all the House I ran away; âAnd thus far travell'd through the sultry day; âAnd, O don't send me back! I dare not goââ âI send you back!â the Miller cried, âno, no.â Th' appeals of Wretchedness had weight with him, And Sympathy would warm him every limb; He mutter'd, glorying in the work begun, Well done, my little Wench; 'twas nobly done! Then said, with looks more cheering than the fire, And feelings such as Pity can inspire, âMy house has childless been this many a year; âWhile you deserve it you shall tarry here.â The Orphan mark'd the ardor of his eye, Blest his kind words, and thank'd him with a sigh. Thus was the sacred compact doubly seal'd; Thus were her spirits rais'd, her bruises heal'd Thankful, and cheerful too, no more afraid, Thus little PhÅbe was the Miller's Maid Grateful they found her; patient of controul A most bewitching gentleness of soul Made pleasure of what work she had to do: She grew in stature, and in beauty too. Five years she pass'd in this delightful home; Five happy years: but, when the sixth was come, The Miller, from a Market Town hard by, Brought home a sturdy Youth, his strength to try, To raise the sluice-gates early every morn, To heave his powder'd sacks and grind his corn: And meeting PhÅbe, whom he lov'd so dear, âI've brought you home a Husband, Girl; D'ye hear? âHe begg'd for work; his money seem'd but scant. âThose that will work 'tis pity they should want A Maxim which all ought to remember. C. L.. âSo use him well, and we shall shortly see âWhether he merits what I've done, like thee.â Now throbb'd her heart,âa new sensation quite,â Whene'er the comely Stranger was in sight: For he at once assiduously strove To please so sweet a Maid, and win her love: At ev'ry corner stopp'd her in her way; And saw fresh beauties opening ev'ry day. He took delight in tracing in her face The mantling blush, and ev'ry nameless grace, That Sensibility would bring to view, When Love he mention'd;âLove, and Honour true. But PhÅbe still was shy; and wish'd to know More of the honest Youth, whose manly brow She verily believ'd was Truth's own throne, And all his words as artless as her own: Most true she judg'd; yet, long the Youth forbore Divulging where, and how, he liv'd before; And seem'd to strive his History to hide, Till fair Esteem enlisted on his side. The Miller saw, and mention'd, in his praise, The prompt fidelity of all his ways: Till in a vacant hour, the Dinner done, One day he joking cried, âCome here, my Son! â'Tis pity that so good a Lad as you âBeneath my roof should bring disorders new! âBut here's my PhÅbe,âonce so light and airy âShe'd trip along the passage like a Fairy,â âHas lost her swiftness quite, since here you came:â âAnd yet;âI can't perceive the Girl is lame! âThe obstacles she meets with still fall thicker: âOld as I am I'd turn a corner quicker.â The Youth blush'd deep; and PhÅbe hung her head The good Man smil'd, and thus again he said: âNot that I deem it matter of surprise, âThat you should love to gaze at PhÅbe's eyes; âBut be explicit, Boy; and deal with honour: âI feel my happiness depend upon her. âWhen here you came you'd sorrow on your brow; âAnd I've forborne to question you till now. âFirst, then, say what thou art.â He instant bow'd, And thus, in PhÅbe's hearing, spoke aloud: âThus far experienc'd, Sir, in you I find âAll that is generous, fatherly, and kind; âAnd while you look for proofs of real worth, âYou'll not regard the meanness of my birth, âWhen, pennyless and sad, you met with me, âI'd just escap'd the dangers of the Sea; âResolv'd to try my fortune on the shore: âTo get my bread; and trust the waves no more: âHaving no Home, nor Parents, left behind, âI'd all my fortune, all my Friends, to find. âKeen disappointment wounded me that morn: âFor, trav'lling near the spot where I was born, âI at the well-known door where I was bred, âInquir'd who still was living, who was dead: âBut first, and most, I sought with anxious fear, âTldings to gain of her who once was dear; âA Girl, with all the meekness of the dove, âThe constant sharer of my childhood's love; âShe call'd me, Brother:âwhich I heard with pride, âThough now suspect we are not so allied. âThus much I learnt; (no more the churls would say;) âShe went to service, and she ran away, âAnd scandal addedâââHold!â the Miller cried, And, in an instant, stood at PhÅbe's side; For he observ'd, while list'ning to the tale, Her spirits faulter'd, and her cheeks turn'd pale; Whilst her clasp'd hands descended to her knee, She sinking whisper'd forth, âO God, 'tis he!â The good Man, though he guess'd the pleasing truth, Was far too busy to inform the Youth; But stirr'd himself amain to aid his Wife, Who soon restor'd the trembler back to life. Awhile insensible she still appear'd; But, âO my Brother,â was distinctly heard: Th'astonish'd Youth now held her to his breast; And tears and kisses soon explain'd the rest. Past deeds now from each tongue alternate fell. For news of dearest import both could tell. Fondly, from childhood's tears to youth's full prime, They match'd the incidents of jogging time; And prov'd that, when with Tyranny opprest, Poor PhÅbe groan'd with wounds and broken rest, George felt no less: was harass'd and forlorn; A rope's end follow'd him both night and morn. And in that very storm when PhÅbe fled, When the rain drench'd her yet unshelter'd head; That very Storm he on the Ocean brav'd, The Vessel founder'd, and the Boy was sav'd! Mysterious Heav'n!âand O with what delightâ She told the happy issue of her flight: To his charm'd heart a living picture drew; And gave to hospitality its due! The list'ning Host observ'd the gentle Pair; And ponder'd on the means that brought them there: Convinc'd, while unimpeach'd their Virtue stood, 'Twas Heav'n's high Will that he should do them good. But now the anxious Dame, impatient grown, Demanded what the Youth had heard, or known, Whereon to ground those doubts but just exprest;â Doubts, which must interest the feeling breast; âHer Brother wert thou, George?âhow; prithee say âCanst thou forego, or cast that name away?â âNo living proofs have I,â the Youth reply'd, âThat we by closest ties are not allied; âBut in my memory live, and ever will, âA mother's dying wordsâI hear them still: âShe said, to one who watch'd her parting breath, âDon't separate the Children at my death, âThey're not both mine: butââhere the scene was âclos'd, âShe died; and left us helpless and expos'd; âNor Time hath thrown, nor Reason's opening power, âOne friendly ray on that benighted hour.â Ne'er did the Chieftains of a Warring State Hear from the Oracle their half-told fate With more religious fear, or more suspense, Than PhÅbe now endur'd:âfor every sense Became absorb'd in this unwelcome theme, Nay, every meditation, every dream, Th' inexplicable sentence held to view, âThey're not both mine,â was every morning new: For, till this hour, the Maid had never prov'd How far she was enthrall'd, how much she lov'd: In that fond character he first appear'd; His kindness charm'd her, and his smiles endear'd: This dubious mystery the passion crost; Her peace was wounded, and her Lover lost. For George, with all his resolution strove To check the progress of his growing love; Or, if he e'er indulg'd a tender kiss, Th' unravell'd secret robb'd him of his bliss. Health's foe, Suspense, so irksome to be borne, An ever-piercing and retreating thorn, Hung on their Hearts, when Nature bade them rise, And stole Content's bright ensign from their eyes. The good folks saw the change, and griev'd to find These troubles labouring in PhÅbe's mind; They lov'd them both; and with one voice propos'd The only means whence Truth might be disclos'd; That, when the Summer Months should shrink the rill, And scarce its languid stream would turn the Mill, When the Spring broods, and Pigs, and Lambs, were rear'll, (A time when George and PhÅbe might be spar'd,) Their birth-place they should visit once again, To try with joint endeavours to obtain From Record, or Tradition, what might be To chain, or set their chain'd affections free: Affinity beyond all doubts to prove; Or clear the road for Nature and for Love. Never, till now, did PhÅbe count the hours, Or think May long, or wish away its flowers; With mutual sighs both fann'd the wings of Time; As we climb Hills and gladden as we climb, And reach at last the distant promis'd seat, Casting the glowing landscape at our feet. Oft had the Morning Rose with dew been wet, And oft the journeying Sun in glory set, Beyond the willow'd meads of vigorous grass, The steep green hill, and woods they were to pass; When now the day arriv'd: Impatience reign'd; And George,âby trifling obstacles detain'd,â His bending Blackthorn on the threshold prest, Survey'd the windward clouds, and hop'd the best. PhÅbe, attir'd with every modest grace, While Health and Beauty revell'd in her face, Came forth; but soon evinc'd an absent mind, For, back she turn'd for something left behind; Again the same, till George grew tir'd of home, And peevishly exclaim'd, âCome, PhÅbe, come.â Another hindrance yet he had to feel; As from the door they tripp'd with nimble heel, A poor old Man, foot-founder'd and alone, Thus urgent spoke, in Trouble's genuine Tone: âMy pretty Maid, if happiness you seek, âMay disappointment never fade your cheek!â âYours be the joy;âyet, feel another's woe: âO leave some little gift before you go.â His words struck home; and back she turn'd again, (The ready friend of indigence and pain,) To banish hunger from his shatter'd frame; And close behind her, Lo, the Miller came, With jug in hand, and cried, âGeorge, why such haste? âHere; take a draught; and let that Soldier taste.â âThanks for your bounty, Sir;â the Veteran said; Threw down his Wallet, and made bare his head; And straight began, tho' mix'd with doubts and fears, Th' unprefac'd History of his latter years. âI cross'd th' Atlantic with my Comrades brave, âWhere sickness sweeps whole regiments to the grave: âYet I've escap'd; and bear my arms no more; âMy age discharg'd me when I came on shore. âMy Wife, I've heard,ââand here he wip'd his eyes,â âIn the cold corner of the Church-yard lies. âBy her consent it was I left my home: âEmployment fail'd, and poverty was come; âThe Bounty tempted me;âshe had it all: âWe parted; and I've seen my betters fall. âYet, as I'm spar'd, though in this piteous case, âI'm trav'lling homeward to my native place; âThough should I reach that dear remember'd spot, âPerhaps Old Grainger will be quite forgot.â All eyes beheld young George with wonder start: Strong were the secret bodings of his heart; Yet not indulg'd: for he with doubts survey'd By turns the Stranger, and the lovely Maid. âHad you no Children?âââYes, young Man, I'd âtwo: âA Boy, if still he lives, as old as you: âYet not my own; but likely so to prove; âThough but the pledge of an unlawful Love: âI cherish'd him, to hide a Sister's shame: âHe shar'd my best affections, and my name. âBut why, young folks, should I detain you here? âGo: and may blessings wait upon your cheer, âI too will travel on;âperhaps to find âThe only treasure that I left behind. âSuch kindly thoughts my fainting hopes revive. âPhÅbe, my Cherub, art thou still alive?â Could Nature hold!âCould youthful Love forbear! George clasp'd the wond'ring Maid, and whisper'd, âThere! âYou're mine for ever!âO, sustam the rest; âAnd hush the tumult of your throbbing breast. Then to the Soldier turn'd, with manly pride, And fondly led his long-intended Bride. âHere, see your Child: nor wish a sweeter flower. â'Tis George that speaks; thou'lt bless the happy âhour!â âNay, be compos'd; for all will yet be well, âThough here our history's too long to tell.ââ A long-lost Father found, the mystery clear'd, What mingled transports in her face appear'd! The gazing Veteran stood with hands uprais'dâ âArt thou indeed my Child! then, God be prais'd.â O'er his rough cheeks the tears profusely spread: Such as fools say become not Men to shed; Past hours of bliss, regenerated charms, Rose, when he felt his Daughter in his arms: So tender was the scene, the generous Dame Wept, as she told of PhÅbe's virtuous fame, And the good Host, with gestures passing strange, Abstracted seem'd through fields of joy to range: Rejoicing that his favour'd roof should prove Virtue's asylum, and the nurse of Love; Rejoicing that to him the task was given, While his full Soul was mounting up to Heav'n. But now, as from a dream his Reason sprung, And heartiest greetings dwelt upon his tongue: The sounding Kitchen floor at once receiv'd The happy group, with all their fears reliev'd; âSoldier,â he cried, âyou've found your Girl; 'tis âtrue: âBut suffer me to be a Father too; âFor, never Child that blest a Parent's knee, âCould show more duty than she has to me, âStrangely she came; Affliction chas'd her hard: âI pitied her;âand this is my reward! âHere sit you down; recount your perils o'er. âHenceforth be this your home; and grieve no âmore: âPlenty hath shower'd her dewdrops on my head; âCare visits not my Table, nor my Bed. âMy heart's warm wishes thus then I fulfil: âMy Dame and I can live without the Mill: âGeorge, take the whole; I'll near you still remain, âTo guide your judgment in the choice of grain: âIn Virtue's path commence your prosperous life; âAnd from my hand receive your worthy Wife. âRise, PhÅbe; rise, my Girl!âkneel not to me; âBut to that Pow'r who interpos'd for thee. âIntegrity hath mark'd your favourite Youth; âFair budding Honour, Constancy, and Truth: âGo to his arms;âand may unsullied joys âBring smiling round me, rosy Girls and Boys! âI'll love them for thy sake. And may your days âGlide on, as glides the Stream that never stays; âBright as whose shingled bed, till life's decline, âMay all your Worth, and all your Virtues shine!â THE WIDOW TO HER HOUR-GLASS. I Come, friend, I'll turn thee up again: Companion of the lonely hour! Spring thirty times hath fed with rain And cloth'd with leaves my humble bower, Since thou hast stood In frame of wood, On Chest or Window by my side: At every Birth still thou wert near, Still spoke thine admonitions clearâ And, when my Husband died, II I've often watch'd thy streaming sand And seen the growing Mountain rise, And often found Life's hopes to stand On props as weak in Wisdom's eyes: Its conic crown Still sliding down, Again heap'd up, then down again; The sand above more hollow grew, Like days and years still filt'ring through, And mingling joy and pain. III While thus I spin and sometimes sing (For now and then my heart will glow) Thou measur'st Time's expanding wing: By thee the noontide hour I know Though silent thou, Still shalt thou flow, And jog along thy destin'd way: But when I glean the sultry fields, When Earth her yellow Harvest yields, Thou get'st a Holiday. IV Steady as Truth, on either end Thy daily task performing well, Thou'rt Meditation's constant friend, And strik'st the Heart without a Bell: Come, lovely May. Thy lengthen'd day Shall gild once more my native plain; Curl inward here, sweet Woodbine flower;â Companion of the lonely hour, I'll turn thee up again. MARKET-NIGHT. I âO Winds, howl not so long and loud; âNor with your vengeance arm the snow: âBear hence each heavy-loaded cloud: âAnd let the twinkling Star-beams glow. II âNow sweeping floods rush down the slope, âWide scattering ruinâStars, shine soon! âNo other light my Love can hope; âMidnight will want the joyous Moon. III âO guardian Spirits!âYe that dwell âWhere woods, and pits, and hollow ways, âThe lone night-trav'ller's fancy swell âWith fearful tales, of older days,â IV âPress round himâguide his willing steed âThrough darkness, dangers, currents, snows; âWait where, from shelt'ring thickets freed, âThe dreary Heath's rude whirlwind blows; V âThat o'er the Hill with furious sweep âNow writhes, now rends the shivering treeâ âSure-footed beast, thy road thou'lt keep: âNor storm nor darkness startles thee! VI âO blest assurance, (trusty steed,) âTo thee the buried road is known: âHome, all the spur thy footsteps need, âWhen loose the frozen rein is thrown. VII âBetween the roaring blasts that shake âThe naked Elder at the door, âThough not one prattler to me speak, âTheir sleeping sighs delight me more. VIII âSound is their rest:âthey little know âWhat pain, what cold, their Father feels: âBut dream, perhaps, they see him now, âWhile each the promis'd Orange peels. IX âWould it were so!âthe fire burns bright, âAnd on the warming trencher gleams; âIn expectation's raptur'd sight âHow precious his arrival seems! X âI'll look abroad!â'tis piercing cold!â âHow the bleak wind assails his breast! âYet there the parting clouds unfold; âThe storm is verging o'er the West. XI âThere shines a Star!âO welcome Sight!â âThrough the thin vapours bright'ning still! âYet, 'twas beneath the fairest night âThe murd'rer stain'd yon lonely Hill. XII âMercy, kind Heav'n! such thoughts dispel! âNo voice, no foot is heard around! âPerhaps he's near the haunted well! âBut Dapple knows each inch of ground. XIII âDistressing hour! uncertain fate! âO Mercy, Mercy, guide him home!â âHark!âthen I heard the distant gate,â âRepeat it, Echo; quickly, come! XIV âOne minute now will ease my fearsâ âOr, still more wretched must I be? âNo: surely Heaven has spar'd our tears âI see him, cloth'd in snow;â'tis he.â XV âWhere have you stay'd? put down your load. âHow have you borne the storm, the cold? âWhat horrors did I not forbodeâ âThat Beast is worth his weight in gold.â XVI Thus spoke the joyful Wife;âthen ran In grateful steams to hide her head: Dapple was hous'd, the weary Man With joy glanc'd o'er the Children's bed. XVII âWhat, all asleep!âso best; he cried: âO what a night I've travell'd through! âUnseen, unheard, I might have died; âBut Heaven has brought me safe to you. XVIII âDear Partner of my nights and days, âThat smile becomes thee!âLet us then âLearn, though mishap may cross our ways, âIt is not ours to reckon when.â THE FAKENHAM GHOST, A BALLAD. I The Lawns were dry in Euston Park; (Here Truth This Ballad is founded on a fact. The circumstance occurred perhaps long before I was born; but is still related by my Mother, and some of the oldest inhabitants in that part of the country R. B. inspires my Tale) The lonely footpath, still and dark, Led over Hill and Dale II Benighted was an ancient Dame, And fearful haste she made To gain the vale of Fakenham, And hail its Willow shade. III Her footsteps knew no idle stops, But follow'd faster still; And echo'd to the darksome Copse That whisper'd on the Hill; IV Where clam'rous Rooks, yet scarcely hush'd, Bespoke a peopled shade; And many a wing the foliage brush'd, And hov'ring circuits made. V The dappled herd of grazing Deer That sought the Shades by day, Now started from her path with fear, And gave the Stranger way. VI Darker it grew; and darker fears Came o'er her troubled mind; When now, a short quick step she hears Come patting close behind. VII She turn'd; it stopt!ânought could she see Upon the gloomy plain! But, as she strove the Sprite to flee, She heard the same again. VIII Now terror seiz'd her quaking frame: For, where the path was bare, The trotting Ghost kept on the same! She mutter'd many a pray'r. IX Yet once again, amidst her fright She tried what sight could do; When through the cheating glooms of night, A monster stood in view. X Regardless of whate'er she felt, It follow'd down the plain! She own'd her sins, and down she knelt, And said her pray'rs again. XI Then on she sped: and Hope grew strong, The white park-gate in view; Which pushing hard, so long it swung That Ghost and all pass'd through. XII Loud fell the gate against the post! Her heart-strings like to crack: For, much she fear'd the grisly Ghost Would leap upon her back. XIII Still on, pat, pat, the Goblin went, As it had done before:â Her strength and resolution spent, She fainted at the door. XIV Out came her Husband, much surpris'd: Out came her Daughter dear: Good-natur'd Souls! all unadvis'd Of what they had to fear. XV The Candle's gleam pierc'd through the night, Some short space o'er the green; And there the little trotting Sprite Distinctly might be seen. XVI An Ass's Foal had lost its Dam Within the spacious Park; And simple as the playful Lamb, Had follow'd in the dark. XVII No Goblin he; no imp of sin: No crimes had ever known. They took the shaggy stranger in, And rear'd him as their own. XVIII His little hoofs would rattle round Upon the Cottage floor: The Matron learn'd to love the sound That frighten'd her before. XIX A favorite the Ghost became; And, 'twas his fate to thrive: And long he liv'd and spread his fame, And kept the joke alive. XX For many a laugh went through the Vale; And some conviction too:â Each thought some other Goblin tale, Perhaps, was just as true. THE FRENCH MARINER. A BALLAD. I An old French Mariner am I, Whom Time hath render'd poor and gray: Hear, conquering Britons, ere I die, What anguish prompts me thus to say. II I've rode o'er many a dreadful wave, I've seen the reeking blood descend: I've heard the last groans of the brave;â The shipmate dear, the steady Friend. III 'Twas when De Grasse the battle join'd, And struck, on April's fatal morn: I left three smiling boys behind, And saw my Country's Lily torn. IV There, as I brav'd the storms of Fate, Dead in my arms my Brother fell; Here sits forlorn his widow'd Mate, Who weeps whene'er the tale I tell. V Thy reign, sweet Peace, was o'er too soon; War, piecemeal, robs me of my joy: For, on the blood-stain'd first of June Death took my eldest favourite Boy. VI The other two enrag'd arose, âOur Country claims our lives,â they said. With them I lost my Soul's repose, That fatal hour my last hope fled. VII With Brueys the proud Nile they sought: Where one in ling'ring wounds expir'd; While yet the other bravely fought The Orient's magazine was fir'd. VIII And must I mourn my Country's shame? And envious curse the conquering Foe? No more I feel that thirst of Fame;â All I can feel is private woe. IX E'en all the joy that Vict'ry brings, (Her bellowing Guns, and flaming pride) Cold, momentary comfort flings Around where weeping Friends reside. X Whose blighted bud no Sun shall cheer, Whose Lamp of Life no longer shine: Some Parent, Brother, Child, most dear, Who ventur'd, and who died like mine. XI Proud crested Fiend, the World's worst foe, Ambition; canst thou boast one deed, Whence no unsightly horrors flow, Nor private peace is seen to bleed. XII Ah! why do these old Eyes remain To see succeeding mornings rise! My Wife is dead, my Children slain, And Poverty is all my prize. XIII Yet shall not poor enfeebled Age Breathe forth revenge;âbut kneel and pray, O God, who seest the Battle's rage, Take from men's Hearts that rage away. XIV From the vindictive tongue of Strife, Bid Hatred and false Glory flee; That babes may meet advancing life, Nor feel the woes that light on me. DOLLY âIngenuous trust, and confidence of Love.â I The Bat began with giddy wing His circuit round the Shed, the Tree; And clouds of dancing Gnats to sing A summer-night's serenity. II Darkness crept slowly o'er the East! Upon the Barn-roof watch'd the Cat; Sweet breath'd the ruminating Beast At rest where Dolly musing sat. III A simple Maid, who could employ The silent lapse of Evening mild, And lov'd its solitary joy: For Dolly was Reflection's child. IV He who had pledg'd his word to be Her life's dear guardian, far away, The flow'r of Yeoman Cavalry, Bestrode a Steed with trappings gay. V And thus from Memory's treasur'd sweets, And thus from Love's pure fount she drew That peace, which busy care defeats, And bids our pleasures bloom anew. VI Six weeks of absence have I borne Since Henry took his fond farewell: The charms of that delightful morn My tongue could thus for ever tell. VII He at my Window whistling loud, Arous'd my lightsome heart to go: Day, conqu'ring, climb'd from cloud to cloud; The fields all wore a purple glow. VIII We stroll'd the bordering flow'rs among: One hand the Bridle held behind; The other round my waist was flung: Sure never Youth spoke half so kind! IX The rising Lark I could but hear; And jocund seem'd the song to be: But sweeter sounded in my ear, âWill Dolly still be true to me!â X From the rude Dock my skirt had swept A fringe of clinging burs so green; Like them our hearts still closer crept, And hook'd a thousand holds unseen. XI High o'er the road each branching bough Its globes of silent dew had shed; And on the pure-wash'd sand below The dimpling drops around had spread. XII The sweet-brier op'd its pink-ey'd rose, And gave its fragrance to the gale; Though modest flow'rs may sweets disclose, More sweet was Henry's earnest tale. XIII He seem'd, methought, on that dear morn, To pour out all his heart to me; As if, the separation borne, The coming hours would joyless be. XIV A bank rose high beside the way, And full against the morning Sun; Of heav'nly blue the violets gay His hand invited one by one. XV The posy with a smile he gave; I saw his meaning in his eyes: The wither'd treasure still I have; My bosom holds the fragrant prize. XVI With his last kiss he would have vow'd; But blessings crouding fore'd their way. Then mounted he his Courser proud; His time was gone, he could not stay. XVII Then first I felt the parting pang;â Sure the worst pang the Lover feels! His Horse unruly from me sprang, The pebbles flew beneath his heels; XVIII Then down the road his vigour tried, His rider gazing, gazing still; âMy dearest, I'll be true,â he cried:â And, if he lives, I'm sure he will. LINES, OCCASIONED BY A VISIT TO Whittlebury Forest, Northamptonshire, In August, 1800. ADDRESSED TO MY CHILDREN. I Genius of the Forest Shades! Lend thy pow'r, and lend thine ear A Stranger trod thy lonely glades, Amidst thy dark and bounding Deer, Inquiring Childhood claims the verse, O let them not inquire in vain; Be with me while I thus rehearse The glories of thy Sylvan Reign. II Thy Dells by wint'ry currents worn, Secluded haunts, how dear to me! From all but Nature's converse borne. No ear to hear, no eye to see. Their honour'd leaves the green Oaks rear'd, And crown'd the upland's graceful swell; While answering through the vale was heard Each distant Heifer's tinkling bell. III Hail, Greenwood shades, that stretching far, Defy e'en Summer's noontide pow'r, When August in his burning Car Withholds the Cloud, withholds the Show'r. The deep-ton'd Low from either Hill, Down hazel aisles and arches green; (The Herd's rude tracks from rill to rill) Roar'd echoing through the solemn scene. IV From my charm'd heart the numbers sprung, Though Birds had ceas'd the choral lay: I pour'd wild raptures from my tongue, And gave delicious tears their way. Then, darker shadows seeking still, Where human foot had seldom stray'd, I read aloud to every Hill Sweet Emma's Love, âthe Nut-brown Maid.â V Shaking his matted mane on high, The gazing Colt would raise his head; Or, tim'rous Doe would rushing fly, And leave to me her grassy bed: Where, as the azure sky appear'd Through Bow'rs of every varying form, 'Midst the deep gloom methought I heard The daring progress of the storm. VI How would each sweeping pond'rous bough Resist, when straight the Whirlwind cleaves, Dashing in strength'ning eddies through A roaring wilderness of leaves! How would the prone descending show'r From the green Canopy rebound! How would the lowland torrents pour! How deep the pealing thunder sound! VII But Peace was there: no lightnings blaz'd:â No clouds obscur'd the face of heav'n: Down each green op'ning while I gaz'd My thoughts to home, and you, were giv'n. O tender minds! in life's gay morn Some clouds must dim your coming day; Yet, bootless pride and falsehood scorn, And peace like this shall cheer your way. VIII Now, at the dark Wood's stately side, Well pleas'd I met the Sun again; Here fleeting Fancy travell'd wide! My seat was destin'd to the Main: For, many an Oak lay stretch'd at length, Whose trunks (with bark no longer sheath'd) Had reach'd their full meridian strength Before your Father's Father breath'd! IX Perhaps they'll many a conflict brave, And many a dreadful storm defy; Then groaning o'er the adverse wave Bring home the flag of victory. Go, then, proud Oaks: we meet no more! Go, grace the scenes to me denied, The white Cliffs round my native shore, And the loud Ocean's swelling tide. X âGenius of the Forest Shades,â Sweet, from the heights of thy domain, When the grey ev'ning shadow fades, To view the Country's golden grain! To view the gleaming Village Spire 'Midst distant groves unknown to me; Groves that, grown bright in borrow'd fire, Bow o'er the peopled Vales to thee! XI Where was thy Elfin train, that play Round Wake's huge Oak, their favorite tree, Dancing the twilight hours away? Why were they not reveal'd to me! Yet, smiling Fairies left behind, Affection brought you all to view; To love and tenderness resign'd, My heart heav'd many a sigh for you. XII When Morning still unclouded rose, Refresh'd with sleep and joyous dreams, Where fruitful fields with woodlands close, I trac'd the births of various streams. From beds of Clay, here creeping rills Unseen to parent Ouse would steal; Or, gushing from the northward Hills, Would glitter through Toves' winding dale. XIII But ah! ye cooling springs, farewell! Herds, I no more your freedom share; But long my grateful tongue shall tell What brought your gazing stranger there. âGenius of the Forest Shades, âLend thy power, and lend thine ear;â Let dreams still lengthen thy long glades, And bring thy peace and silence here. SONG FOR A HIGHLAND DROVER RETURNING FROM ENGLAND. I Now fare-thee-well, England; no further I'll roam; But follow my shadow that points the way home: Your gay southern Shores shall not tempt me to stay; For my Maggy's at Home, and my Children at play! 'Tis this makes my Bonnet sit light on my brow, Gives my sinews their strength and my bosom its glow. II Farewell, Mountaineers! my companions, adieu; Soon, many long miles when I'm sever'd from you, I shall miss your white Horns on the brink of the burn, And o'er the rough Heaths, where you'll never return; But in brave English pastures you cannot complain, While your Drover speeds back to his Maggy again. III O Tweed! gentle Tweed, as I pass your green vales, More than life, more than Love my tir'd Spirit inhales; There Scotland, my darling, lies full in my view, With her bare-footed Lasses and Mountains so blue; To the mountains away; my heart bounds like the hind; For home is so sweet, and my Maggy so kind. IV As day after day I still follow my course, And in fancy trace back every Stream to its source, Hope cheers me up hills, where the road lies before, O'er hills just as high, and o'er tracks of wild Moor; The keen polar Star nightly rising to view; But Maggy's my Star, just as steady and true. V O Ghosts of my Fathers! O heroes, look down! Fix my wandering thoughts on your deeds of renown, For the glory of Scotland reigns warm in my breast, And fortitude grows both from toil and from rest; May your deeds and your worth be for ever in view, And may Maggy bear sons not unworthy of you. VI Love, why do you urge me, so weary and poor? I cannot step faster, I cannot do more: I've pass'd silver Tweed; e'en the Tay flows behind: Yet fatigue I'll disdain;âmy reward I shall find; Thou, sweet smile of innocence, thou art my prize; And the joy that will sparkle in Maggy's blue eyes. VII She'll watch to the southward;âperhaps she will sigh, That the way is so long, and the Mountains so high; Perhaps some huge rock in the dusk she may see, And will say in her fondness, âthat surely is he!â Good Wife, you're deceiv'd; I'm still far from my home; Go, sleep, my dear Maggy,âto-morrow I'll come. A WORD TO TWO YOUNG LADIES. I When tender Rose-trees first receive, On half-expanded Leaves, the Shower; Hope's gayest pictures we believe, And anxious watch each coming flower. II Then, if beneath the genial Sun That spreads abroad the full-blown May, Two infant Stems the rest out-run, Their buds the first to meet the day, III With joy their op'ning tints we view, While morning's precious moments fly. My pretty Maids, 'tis thus with you, The fond admiring gazer, I. IV Preserve, sweet Buds, where'er you be, The richest gem that decks a Wife; The charm of female modesty; And let sweet Music give it life. V Still may the favoring Muse be found: Still circumspect the paths ye tread: Plant moral truths in Fancy's ground; And meet old Age without a dread. VI Yet, ere that comes, while yet ye quaff The cup of Health without a pain, I'll shake my grey hairs when you laugh, And, when you sing, be young again. Both the young Ladies had addressed to me a few complimentary lines, (and I am sorry that those of the elder sister were never in my possession;) in return for which I sent the above. It was received on the day on which the younger completed her ninth year. Surely it cannot be ascribed to vanity, if, in gratitude to a most amiable family, I here preserve verbatim an effort of a child nine years old. I have the more pleasure in doing it, because I know them to be her own.âR. B. âAccept, dear Bard, the Muse's genuine thought, âAnd take not ill the tribute of my heart:â âFor thee the laureate wreath of praise I'll bind; âNone that have read thy commendable mind âCan let it pass unnotic'dânor can Iâ âFor by thy lays I know thy sympathy.â F. P ON HEARING OF THE TRANSLATION OF PART OF THE FARMER'S BOY INTO LATIN; BY THE REV. MR. Câ Hey, Giles! in what new garb art dress'd? For Lads like you methinks a bold one; I'm glad to see thee so caress'd; But, hark ye!âdon't despise your old one. Thou'rt not the first by many a Boy Who've found abroad good friends to own'em; Then, in such Coats have shown their joy, E'en their own Fathers have not known em. NANCY. A SONG I You ask me, dear Nancy, what makes me presume That you cherish a secret affection for me? When we see the Flow'rs bud, don't we look for the Bloom? Then, sweetest, attend, while I answer to thee. II When we Young Men with pastimes the Twilight beguile, I watch your plump cheek till it dimples with joy: And observe, that whatever occasions the smile, You give me a glance; but provokingly coy. III Last month, when wild strawberries pluckt in the grovs Like beads on the tall seeded grass you had strung; You gave me the choicest; I hop'd 'twas for Love; And I told you my hopes while the Nightingale sung. IV Remember the Viper:â'twas close at your feet, How you started, and threw yourself into my arms; Not a Strawberry there was so ripe nor so sweet As the lips which I kiss'd to subdue your alarms. V As I pull'd down the clusters of Nuts for my Fair, What a blow I receiv'd from a strong bending bough; Though Lucy and other gay lasses were there, Not one of them show'd such compassion as yon. VI And was it compassion?âby Heaven 'twas more! A telltale betrays you;âthat blush on your cheek. Then come, dearest Maid, all your trifling give o'er, And whisper what Candour will teach you to speak VII Can you stain my fair Honour with one broken vow? Can you say that I've ever occasion'd a pain? On Truth's honest base let your tenderness grow; I swear to be faithful, again and again. ROSY HANNAH. I A Spring, o'erhung with many a flower, The grey sand dancing in its bed, Embank'd beneath a Hawthorn bower, Sent forth its waters near my head: A rosy Lass approach'd my view; I caught her blue eye's modest beam: The stranger nodded âhow d'ye do!â And leap'd across the infant stream. II The water heedless pass'd away: With me her glowing image stay'd: I strove, from that auspicious day, To meet and bless the lovely Maid. I met her where beneath our feet Through downy Moss the wild Thyme grew; Nor Moss elastic, flow'rs though sweet, Match'd Hannah's cheek of rosy hue. III I met her where the dark Woods wave, And shaded verdure skirts the plain; And when the pale Moon rising gave New glories to her clouded train. From her sweet cot upon the Moor Our plighted vows to Heaven are flown: Truth made me welcome at her door, And rosy Hannah is my own. SONG. THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG ROVER. I Rover, awake! the grey Cock crows! Come, shake your coat and go with me! High in the East the green Hill glows; And glory crowns our shelt'ring Tree. The Sheep expect us at the fold: My faithful Dog, let's haste away, And in his earliest beams behold, And hail, the source of cheerful day. II Half his broad Orb o'erlooks the Hill; And, darting down the valley flies, At every casement welcome still, The golden summons of the skies. Go, fetch my Staff; and o'er the dews Let Echo waft thy gladsome voice. Shall we a cheerful note refuse When rising Morn proclaims, ârejoice.â III Now then we'll start; and thus I'll sling Our store, a trivial load to bear: Yet, ere night comes, should hunger sting, I'll not encroach on Rover's share. The fresh breeze bears its sweets along; The Lark but chides us while we stay: Soon shall the Vale repeat my song; Go brush before, away, away. HUNTING SONG. I Ye darksome Woods where Echo dwells, Where every bud with freedom swells To meet the glorious day: The morning breaks; again rejoice; And with old Ringwood's well-known voice Bid tuneful Echo play. II We come, ye Groves, ye Hills, we come: The vagrant Fox shall hear his doom, And dread our jovial train. The shrill Horn sounds, the courser flies, While every Sportsman joyful cries, âThere's Ringwood's voice again.â III Ye Meadows, hail the coming throng, Ye peaceful Streams that wind along, Repeat the Hark-away: Far o'er the Downs, ye Gales that sweep, The daring Oak that crowns the steep, The roaring peal convey. IV The chiming notes of cheerful Hounds, Hark! how the hollow Dale resounds; The sunny Hills how gay. But where's the note, brave Dog, like thine Then urge the Steed, the chorus join, 'Tis Ringwood leads the way. LUCY. A SONG. I Thy favourite Bird is soaring still: My Lucy, haste thee o'er the dale; The Stream's let loose, and from the Mill All silent comes the balmy gale; Yet, so lightly on its way, Seems to whisper, âHoliday.â II The pathway flowers that bending meet, And give the Meads their yellow hue, The May-bush and the Meadow-sweet Reserve their fragrance all for you. Why then, Lucy, why delay? Let us share the Holiday. III Since there thy smiles, my charming Maid, Are with unfeigned rapture seen, To Beauty be the Homage paid; Come, claim the triumph of the Green. Here's my Hand, come, come away; Share the merry Holiday. IV A promise too my Lucy made, (And shall my heart its claim resign?) That ere May-flowers again should fade, Her heart and hand should both be mine. Hark'ye, Lucy, this is May; Love shall crown our Holiday. WINTER SONG. I Dear Boy, throw that Icicle down, And sweep this deep snow from the door; Old Winter comes on with a frown; A terrible frown for the poor. In a Season so rude and forlorn, How can age, how can infancy bear The silent neglect and the scorn Of those who have plenty to spare? II Fresh broach'd is my Cask of old Ale, Well-tim'd now the frost is set in; Here's Job come to tell us a tale, We'll make him at home to a pin. While my Wife and I bask o'er the fire, The roll of the Seasons will prove, That Time may diminish desire, But cannot extinguish true love. III O the pleasures of neighbourly chat, If you can but keep scandal away, To learn what the world has been at, And what the great Orators say; Though the Wind through the creviees sing, And Hail down the chimney rebound; I'm happier than many a king While the Bellows blows Bass to the sound. IV Abundance was never my lot: But out of the trifle that's given, That no curse may alight on my Cot, I'll distribute the bounty of Heav'n; The fool and the slave gather wealth: But if I add nought to my store, Yet while I keep conscience in health, I've a Mine that will never grow poor. WILD FLOWERS; OR, PASTORAL AND LOCAL POETRY. DEDICATION. TO MY ELDEST SON. ABNER AND THE WIDOW JONES. A FAMILIAR BALLAD. I âWell! I'm determin'd; that's enough:â âGee, Bayard! move your poor old bones, âI'll take to-morrow, smooth or rough, âTo go and court the Widow Jones. II âOur master talks of stable-room, âAnd younger horses on his grounds; â'Tis easy to foresee thy doom, âBayard, thou'lt go to feed the hounds. III âBut could I win the widow's hand, âI'd make a truce 'twixt death and thee; âFor thou upon the best of land âShould'st feed, and live, and die with me. IV âAnd must the pole-axe lay thee low? âAnd will they pick thy poor old bones? âNoâhang me if it shall be so,â âIf I can win the Widow Jones.â V Twirl went his stick; his curly pate A bran-new hat uplifted bore; And Abner, as he leapt the gate, Had never look'd so gay before. VI And every spark of love reviv'd That had perplex'd him long ago, When busy folks and fools contriv'd To make his Mary answerâno. VII But whether, freed from recent vows, Her heart had back to Abner flown, And mark'd him for a second spouse, In truth is not exactly known. VIII Howbeit, as he came in sight, She turn'd her from the garden stile, And downward look'd with pure delight, With half a sigh and half a smile. IX She heard his sounding step behind, The blush of joy crept up her cheek, As cheerly floated on the wind, âHoi! Mary Jonesâwhat won't you speak?â X Then, with a look that ne'er deceives, She turn'd, but found her courage fled; And scolding sparrows from the eaves Peep'd forth upon the stranger's head. XI Down Abner sat, with glowing heart, Resolv'd, whatever might betide, To speak his mind, no other art He ever knew, or ever tried. XII And gently twitching Mary's hand, The bench had ample room for two, His first word made her understand The ploughman's errand was to woo. XIII âMy Maryâmay I call thee so? âFor many a happy day we've seen, âAnd if not mine, aye, years ago, âWhose was the fault? you might have been XIV âAll that's gone by: but I've been musing, âAnd vow'd, and hope to keep it true, âThat she shall be my own heart's choosing âWhom I call wife.âHey, what say you? XV âAnd as I drove my plough along, âAnd felt the strength that's in my arm, âTen years, thought I, amidst my song, âI've been head-man at Harewood farm. XVI âAnd now, my own dear Mary's free, âWhom I have lov'd this many a day, âWho knows but she may think on me? âI'll go hear what she has to say. XVII âPerhaps that little stock of land âShe holds, but knows not how to till, âWill suffer in the widow's hand, âAnd make poor Mary poorer still. XVIII âThat scrap of land, with one like her, âHow we might live! and be so blest! âAnd who should Mary Jones prefer? âWhy, surely, him who loves her best! XIX âTherefore I'm come to-night, sweet wench, âI would not idly thus intrude,ââ Mary look'd downward on the bench, O'erpower'd by love and gratitude. XX And lean'd her head against the vine, With quick'ning sobs of silent bliss, Till Abner cried, âYou must be mine, âYou must,ââand seal'd it with a kiss. XXI She talk'd of shame, and wip'd her cheek, But what had shame with them to do. Who nothing meant but truth to speak, And downright honour to pursue? XXII His eloquence improv'd apace, As manly pity fill'd his mind; âYou know poor Bayard; here's the case,â âHe's past his labour, old, and blind: XXIII âIf you and I should but agree âTo settle here for good and all, âCould you give all your heart to me, âAnd grudge that poor old rogue a stall? XXIV âI'll buy him, for the dogs shall never âSet tooth upon a friend so true; âHe'll not live long, but I for ever âShall know I gave the beast his due. XXV â'Mongst all I've known of ploughs and carts, âAnd ever since I learn'd to drive, âHe was not match'd in all these parts; âThere was not such a horse alive! XXVI âReady, as birds to meet the morn, âWere all his efforts at the plough; âThen, the mill-brook with hay or corn, âGood creature! how he'd spatter through XXVII âHe was a horse of mighty pow'r, âCompact in frame, and strong of limb; âWent with a chirp from hour to hour; âWhip-cord! 'twas never made for him. XXVIII âI left him in the shafts behind, âHis fellows all unhook'd and gone, âHe neigh'd, and deem'd the thing unking, âThen, starting, drew the load alone! XXIX âBut I might talk till pitch-dark night, âAnd then have something left to say; âBut, Mary, am I wrong or right, âOr, do I throw my words away? XXX âLeave me, or take me and my horse; âI've told thee truth, and all I know: âTruth should breed truth; that comes of course; âIf I sow wheat, why wheat will grow.â XXXI âYes, Abner, but thus soon to yield, âNeighbours would fleer, and look behind 'em; âThough, with a husband in the field, âPerhaps, indeed, I should not mind 'em. XXXII âI've known your generous nature well; âMy first denial cost me dear; âHow this may end we cannot tell, âBut, as for Bayard, bring him here.â XXXIII âBless thee for that,â the ploughman cried, At once both starting from the seat, He stood a guardian by her side, But talk'd of home,â'twas growing late. XXXIV Then step for step within his arm, She cheer'd him down the dewy way; And no two birds upon the farm E'er parted with more joy than they. XXXV What news at home? The smile he wore One little sentence turn'd to sorrow; An order met him at the door, âTake Bayard to the dogs to-morrow.â XXXXVI Yes, yes, thought he; and heav'd a sigh, Die when he will he's not your debtor: I must obey, and he must die,â That's if I can't contrive it better. XXXVII He left his Mary late at night, And had succeeded in the main; No sooner peep'd the morning light But he was on the road again! XXXVIII Suppose she should refuse her hand? Such thoughts will come, I know not why, Shall I, without a wife or land, Want an old horse? then wherefore buy? XXXIX From bush to bush, from stile to stile, Perplex'd he trod the fallow ground, And told his money all the while, And weigh'd the matter round and round. XL âI'll borrow,â that's the best thought yet; Mary shall save the horse's life.â Kind-hearted wench! what, run in debt Before I know she'll be my wife? XLI These women won't speak plain and free.â Well, well, I'll keep my service still; She has not said she'd marry me, But yet I dare to say she will. XLII But while I take this shay-brain'd course, And like a fool run to and fro, Master, perhaps, may sell the horse! Sell him!âthis instant home I'll go. XLIII The nightly rains had drench'd the grove, He plung'd right on with headlong pace A man but half as much in love Perhaps had found a cleaner place. XLIV The day rose fair; with team a-field, He watch'd the farmer's cheerful brow; And in a lucky hour reveal'd His secret at his post, the plough. XLV And there without a whine began, âMaster, you'll give me your advice; âI'm going to marryâif I canâ âAnd want old Bayard; what's his price? XLVI âFor Mary Jones last night agreed, âOr near upon't, to be my wife: âThe horse's value I don't heed, âI only want to save his life.â XLVII âBuy him, hey! Abner! trust me I âHave not the thought of gain in view; âBayard's best days we've seen go by; âHe shall be cheap enough to you.â XLVIII The wages paid, the horse brought out, The hour of separation come; The farmer turn'd his chair about, âGood fellow, take him, take him home. XLIX âYou're welcome, Abner, to the beast, âFor you've a faithful servant been; âThey'll thrive I doubt not in the least, âWho know what work and service mean.â L The maids at parting, one and all, From different windows different tones; Bade him farewell with many a bawl, And sent their love to Mary Jones. LI He wav'd his hat, and turn'd away, When loud the cry of children rose; âAbner, good bye!â they stopt their play; âThere goes poor Bayard! there he goes!â LII Half choak'd with joy, with love, and pride, He now with dainty clover fed him, Now took a short triumphant ride, And then again got down and led him. LIII And hobbling onward up the hill, The widow's house was full in sight, He pull'd the bridle harder still, âCome on, we shan't be there to night.â LIV She met them with a smile so sweet, The stable-door was open thrown; The blind horse lifted high his feet, And loudly snorting, laid him down. LV O Victory! from that stock of laurels You keep so snug for camps and thrones, Spare us one twig from all their quarrels, For Abner and the Widow Jones. TO MY OLD OAK TABLE. Friend of my peaceful days! substantial friend, Whom wealth can never change, nor int'rest bend, I love thee like a child. Thou wert to me The dumb companion of my misery, And oftner of my joys;âthen as I spoke, I shar'd thy sympathy, Old Heart of Oak! For surely when my labour ceas'd at night, With trembling, feverish hands, and aching sight, The draught that cheer'd me and subdu'd my care, On thy broad shoulders thou wert proud to bear. O'er thee, with expectation's fire elate, I've sat and ponder'd on my future fate: On thee, with winter muffins for thy store, I've lean'd, and quite forgot that I was poor. Where dropp'd the acorn that gave birth to thee? Can'st thou trace back thy line of ancestry? We're match'd, old friend, and let us not repine, Darkness o'erhangs thy origin and mine, Both may be truly honourable: yet, We'll date our honours from the day we met; When, of my worldly wealth the parent stock, Right welcome up the Thames from Woolwich Dock Thou cam'st, when hopes ran high, and love was young; But soon our olive-branches round thee sprung; Soon came the days that tried a faithful wife, The noise of children, and the cares of life. Then, midst the threat'nings of a wintry sky, That cough which blights the bud of infancy, The dread of parents, Rest's inveterate foe, Came like a plague, and turn'd my songs to woe. Rest! without thee what strength can long survive, What spirit keep the flame of Hope alive? The midnight murmur of the cradle gave Sounds of despair; and chilly as the grave We felt its undulating blast arise, Midst whisper'd sorrows and ten thousand sighs. Expiring embers warn'd us each to sleep, By turns to watch alone, by turns to weep, By turns to hear, and keep from starting wild, The sad, faint wailings of a dying child. But Death, obedient to Heav'n's high command, Withdrew his jav'lin, and unclench'd his hand; The little sufferers triumph'd over pain, Their mother smil'd, and bade me hope again. Yet Care gain'd ground, Exertion triumph'd less, Thick fell the gathering terrors of Distress; Anxietv and Griefs without a name, Had made their dreadful inroads on my frame; The creeping Dropsy, cold as cold could be, Unnervd my arm, and bow'd my head to thee. Thou to thy trust, old friend, hast not been true; These eyes the bitterest tears they ever knew Let fall upon thee; now all wip'd away; But what from memory shall wipe out that day? The great, the wealthy of my native land, To whom a guinea is a grain of sand, I thought upon them, for my thoughts were free, But all unknown were then my woes and me. Still, Resignation was my dearest friend, And Reason pointed to a glorious end; With anxious sighs, a parent's hopes and pride, I wish'd to liveâI trust I could have died! But winter's clouds pursu'd their stormy way, And March brought sunshine with the length'ning day, And bade my heart arise, that morn and night Now throbb'd with irresistible delight. Delightful 'twas to leave disease behind, And feel the renovation of the mind! To lead abroad, upborne on Pleasure's wing, Our children, midst the glories of the spring; Our fellow-sufferers, our only wealth, To gather daisies in the breeze of health! 'Twas then, too, when our prospects grew so fair, And Sabbath bells announc'd the morning pray'r; Beneath that vast gigantic dome we bow'd, That lifts its flaming cross above the cloud; Had gain'd the centre of the chequer'd floor;â That instant, with reverberating roar Burst forth the pealing organâmute we stood The strong sensation boiling through my blood, Rose in a storm of joy, allied to pain, I wept, and worshipp'd God, and wept again And felt, amidst the fervor of my praise, The sweet assurances of better days. In that gay season, honest friend of mine. I marked the brilliant sun upon thee shine Imagination took her flights so free, Home was delicious with my book and thee, The purchas'd nosegay. or brown ears of corn, Were thy gay plumes upon a summer's morn, Awakening memory, that disdains control, They spoke the darling language of my soul: They whisper'd tales of joy, of peace, of truth, And conjur'd back the sunshine of my youth; Fancy presided at the joyful birth, I pour'd the torrent of my feelings forth; Conscious of truth in Nature's humble track, And wrote âThe Farmer's Boyâ upon thy back! Enough, old friend:âthour't mine; and shalt partake, While I have pen to write, or tongue to speak, Whatever fortune deals me.âPart with thee! No, not till death shall set my spirit free; For know, should plenty crown my life's decline, A most important duty may be thine: Then, guard me from Temptation's base control, From apathy and littleness of soul. The sight of thy old frame, so rough, so rude, Shall twitch the sleeve of nodding Gratitude; Shall teach me but to venerate the more Honest Oak Tables and their guestsâthe poor; Teach me unjust distinctions to deride, And falsehoods gender'd in the brain of Pride; Shall give to Fancy still the cheerful hour, To Intellect, its freedom and its power; To Hospitality's enchanting ring A charm, which nothing but thyself can bring. The man who would not look with honest pride On the tight bark that stemm'd the roaring tide, And bore him, when he bow'd the trembling knee, Home, through the mighty perils of the sea, I love him not.âHe ne'er shall be my guest; Nor sip my cup, nor witness how I'm blest; Nor lean, to bring my honest friend to shame, A sacrilegious elbow on thy frame; But thou through life a monitor shalt prove, Sacred to Truth, to Poetry, and Love. Dec. 1803. THE HORKEY. A PROVINCIAL BALLAD. I What gossips prattled in the sun, Who talk'd him fairly down, Up, Memory! tell; 'tis Suffolk fun, And lingo of their own. II Ah! Judie Twitchet! though thou'rt dead, With thee the tale begins; For still seems thrumming in my head The rattling of thy pins. III Thou Queen of knitters! for a ball Of worsted was thy pride; With dangling stockings great and small, And world of clack beside! IV âWe did so laugh; the moon shone bright; âMore fun you never knew; â'Twas Farmer Cheerum's Horkey night, âAnd I, and Grace, and Sueâ V âBut bring a stool, sit round about, âAnd boys, be quiet, pray; âAnd let me tell my story out; â'Twas sitch a merry day! VI âThe butcher whistled at the door, âAnd brought a load of meat; âBoys rubb'd their hands, and cried, âthere's more,â âDogs wagg'd their tails to see't. VII âOn went the boilers till the hake A sliding pot-hook âHad much ado to bear 'em; âThe magpie talk'd for talking sake, âBirds sung;âbut who could hear 'em? VIII âCreak went the jack; the cats were scar'd, âWe had not time to heed 'em, âThe owd hins cackled in the yard, âFor we forgot to feed 'em! IX âYet 'twas not I, as I may say, âBecause as how, d'ye see, âI only help'd there for the day; âThey cou'dn't lay't to me. X âNow Mrs. Cheerum's best lace cap âWas mounted on her head, âGuests at the door began to rap, âAnd now the cloth was spread. XI âThen clatter went the earthen platesâ ââMind, Judie,â was the cry; âI could have cop't them at their pates; ââTrenchers for me,â said I, XII âThat look so clean upon the ledge, âAll proof against a fall; âThey never turn a sharp knife's edge, âBut fashion rules us all. XIII âHome came the jovial Horkey load, âLast of the whole year's crop; âAnd Grace amongst the green boughs rode âRight plump upon the top. XIV âThis way and that the waggon reel'd, âAnd never queen rode higher; âHer cheeks were colour'd in the fields, âAnd ours before the fire. XV âThe laughing harvest-folks, and John, âCame in and look'd askew; â'Twas my red face that set them on, âAnd then they leer'd at Sue. XVI âAnd Farmer Cheerum went, good man, âAnd broach'd the Horkey beer; âAnd sitch a mort Such a number of folks began âTo eat up our good cheer. XVII âSays he, âThank God for what's before us; âThat thus we meet agen;â âThe mingling voices, like a chorus, âJoin'd cheerfully, âAmen.ââ XVIII âWelcome and plenty, there they found 'em, âThe ribs of beef grew light; âAnd puddingsâtill the boys got round 'em, âAnd then they vanish'd quite. XIX âNow all the guests, with Farmer Crouder, âBegan to prate of corn; âAnd we found out they talk'd the louder, âThe oftner pass'd the Horn. XX âOut came the nuts; we set a cracking; âThe ale came round our way; âBy gom, we women fell a clacking âAs loud again as they. XXI âJohn sung âOld Benbowâ loud and strong, âAnd I, âThe Constant Swain,â ââCheer up, my Lads,â was Simon's song, ââWe'll conquer them again.â XXII âNow twelve o'clock was drawing nigh, âAnd all in merry cue; âI knock'd the cask, âO, ho!â said I, ââWe've almost conquer'd you.â XXIII âMy Lord The lender of the reapers begg'd round, and held his hat, âSays Farmer Gruff, says he, ââThere's many a Lord, Sam, I know that, ââHas begg'd as well as thee.â XXIV âBump in his hat the shillings tumbled âAll round among the folks; ââLaugh if you wool,â said Sam, and mumbled, ââYou pay for all your jokes.â XXV âJoint stock you know among the men, âTo drink at their own charges; âSo up they got full drive, and then âWent out to halloo largess. XXVI âAnd sure enough the noise they made!!â ââBut let me mind my tale: âWe follow'd them, we worn't afraid, âWe'ad all been drinking ale. XXVII âAs they stood hallooing back to back, âWe, lightly as a feather, âWent sideling round, and in a crack âHad pinn'd their coats together. XXVIII â'Twas near upon't as light as noon; ââA largess, on the hill, âThey shouted to the full round moon, âI think I hear 'em still! XXIX âBut when they found the trick, my stars! âThey well knew who to blame, âOur giggles turn'd to loud ha, ha's, âAnd arter us they came. XXX âThe hindmost was the dairy-maid, âAnd Sam came blundering by; âShe could not shun him, so they said; âI know she did not try. XXXI âAnd off set John, with all his might, âTo chase me down the yard, âTill I was nearly gran'd Strangled outright; âHe hugg'd so woundy hard. XXXII âStill they kept up the race and laugh, âAnd round the house we flew; âBut bark ye! the best fun by half âWas Simon arter Sue. XXXIII âShe car'd not, dark nor light, not she, âSo, near the dairy door âShe pass'd a clean white hog, you see, âThey'd kilt the day before. XXXIV âHigh on the spirket An iron hook. there it hung,â ââNow, Susieâwhat can save ye?â âRound the cold pig his arms he flung, âAnd cried, âAh! here I have ye!â XXXV âThe farmers heard what Simon said, âAnd what a noise! good lack! âSome almost laugh'd themselves to dead âAnd others clapt his back. XXXVI âWe all at once began to tell âWhat fun we had abroad; âBut Simon stood our jeers right well; ââHe fell asleep and snor'd. XXXVII âThen in his button-hole upright, âDid Farmer Crouder put âA slip of paper, twisted tight, âAnd held the candle to't. XXXVIII âIt smok'd, and smok'd, beneath his nose, âThe harmless blaze crept higher; âTill with a vengeance up he rose, âFire, Judie, Sue! fire, fire! XXXIX âThe clock struck oneâsome talk'd of parting, âSome said it was a sin, âAnd hitch'd their chairs;âbut those for starting âNow let the moonlight in. XL âOwd women, loitering for the nonce For the purpose., âStood praising the fine weather; âThe menfolks took the hint at once âTo kiss them altogether. XLI âAnd out ran every soul beside, âA shunny-pated Giddy, thoughtless. crew; âOwd folks could neither run nor hide, âSo some ketch'd one, some tew. XLII âThey skriggl'd To struggle quick. and began to scold, âBut laughing got the master; âSome quack'ling Choaking. cried, âlet go your hold;â âThe farmers held the faster. XLIII âAll innocent, that I'll be sworn, âThere worn't a bit of sorrow, âAnd women, if their gowns are torn, âCan mend them on the morrow. XLIV âOur shadows helter skelter danc'd âAbout the moonlight ground; âThe wondering sheep, as on we pranc'd, âGot up and gaz'd around. XLV âAnd well they mightâtill Farmer Cheerum, âNow with a hearty glee, âBade all good morn as he came near 'em, âAnd then to bed went he. XLVI âThen off we stroll'd this way and that, âWith merry voices ringing; âAnd Echo answered us right pat, âAs home we rambl'd singing. XLVII âFor, when we laugh'd, it laugh'd again, âAnd to our own doors follow'd! ââYo, ho!â we cried; âYo, ho!â so plain, âThe misty meadow halloo'd. XLVIII âThat's all my tale, and all the fun, âCome, turn your wheels about; âMy worsted, see!âthat's nicely done, âJust held my story out!!â XLIX Poor Judie!âThus Time knits or spins The worsted from Life's ball! Death stopt thy tales, and stopt thy pins, âAnd so he'll serve us all. THE BROKEN CRUTCH. A TALE. âI tell you, Peggy,â said a voice behind A hawthorn hedge, with wild briars thick entwin'd, Where unseen trav'llers down a shady way Journey'd beside the swaths of new-mown hay, âI tell you, Peggy, 'tis a time to prove âYour fortitude, your virtue, and your love. âFrom honest poverty our lineage sprung, âYour mother was a servant quite as young;â âYou weep; perhaps she wept at leaving home; âCourage, my girl, nor fear the days to come. âGo still to church, my Peggy, plainly drest, âAnd keep a living conscience in your breast; âLook to yourself, my lass, the maid's best fame, âBeware, nor bring the Meldrums into shame: âBe modest, to the voice of truth attend, âBe honest, and you'll always find a friend: âYour uncle Gilbert, stronger far than I, âWill see you safe; on him you must rely: âI've walk'd too far; this lameness, oh! the pain; âHeav'n bless thee, child! I'll halt me back again; âBut when your first fair holiday may be, âDo, dearest Peggy, spend your hours with me.â Young Herbert Brooks, in strength and manhood bold, Who, round the meads, his own possessions, stroll'd, O'erheard the charge, and with a heart so gay, Whistled his spaniel, and pursu'd his way. Soon cross'd his path, and short obeisance paid, Stout Gilbert Meldrum and a country maid; A box upon his shoulder held full well Her worldly riches, but the truth to tell She bore the chief herself; that nobler part, That beauteous gem, an uncorrupted heart. And then that native loveliness! that cheek! It bore the very tints her betters seek. At such a sight the libertine would glow With all the warmth that he can never know; Would send his thoughts abroad without control, The glimmering moonshine of his little soul. âAbove the reach of justice I shall soar, âHer friends may rail, not punish; they're too poor âThat very thought the rapture will enhance, âPoor, young, and friendless; what a glorious chance âA few spare guineas may the conquest make,â âI love the treachery for treachery's sake,â âAnd when her wounded honour jealous grows, âI'll cut away ten thousand oaths and vows, âAnd bravely boast, all snarling fools defying, âHow I, a girl out-witted,âjust by lying.â Such was not Herbertâhe had never known Love's genuine smiles, nor suffer'd from his frown; And as to that most honourable part Of planting daggers in a parent's heart, A novice quite:âhe past his hours away, Free as a bird, and buxom as the day; Yet, should a lovely girl by chance arise, Think not that Herbert Brooks would shut his eyes. On thy calm joys with what delight I dream, Thou dear green valley of my native stream! Fancy o'er thee still waves th' enchanting wand, And every nook of thine is fairy land, And ever will be, though the axe should smite In Gain's rude service, and in Pity's spite, Thy clustering alders, and at length invade The last, last poplars, that compose thy shade: Thy stream shall still in native freedom stray, And undermine the willows in its way, These, nearly worthless, may survive this storm, This scythe of desolation call'd âReform.â No army past that way! yet are they fled, The boughs that, when a school-boy, screen'd my head I hate the murderous axe; estranging more The winding vale from what it was of yore, Than e'en mortality in all its rage, And all the change of faces in an age. âWarmth,â will they term it, that I speak so free; They strip thy shades,âthy shades so dear to me! In Herbert's days woods cloth'd both hill and dale; But peace, Remembrance! let us tell the tale. His home was in the valley, elms grew round His moated mansion, and the pleasant sound Of woodland birds that loud at day-break sing, With the first cuckoos that proclaim the spring, Flock'd round his dwelling; and his kitchen smoke, That from the towering rookery upward broke, Of joyful import to the poor hard by, Stream'd a glad sign of hospitality; So fancy pictures; but its day is o'er; The moat remains; the dwelling is no more! Its name denotes its melancholy fall, For village children call the spot âBurnt-Hall.â But where's the maid, who in the meadow-way Met Herbert Brooks amongst the new-mown hay? Th' adventure charm'd him, and next morning rose The Sabbath, with its silence and repose; The bells ceas'd chiming, and the broad blue sky Smil'd on his peace, and met his tranquil eye Inverted, from the foot-bridge on his way To that still house where all his fathers lay; There in his seat, each neighbour's face he knewâ The stranger girl was just before his pew! He saw her kneel, with meek, but cheerful air, And whisper the response to every prayer; And, when the humble roof with praises rung, He caught the Hallelujah from her tongue, Rememb'ring with delight the tears that fell When the poor father bade his child farewell; And now, by kindling tenderness beguil'd, He blest the prompt obedience of that child, And link'd his fate with hers:âfor, from that day, Whether the weeks past cheerily away, Or deep revolving doubts procur'd him pain, The same bells chim'dâand there she was again! What could be done? they came not there to woo, On holy ground,âthough love is holy too. They met upon the foot-bridge one clear morn, She in the garb by village lasses worn; He, with unbutton'd frock that careless flew, And buskin'd to resist the morning dew; With downcast look she courtsied to the ground, Just in his pathâno room to sidle round. âWell, pretty girl, this early rising yields âThe best enjoyment of the groves and fields. âAnd makes the heart susceptible and meek, âAnd keeps alive that rose upon your cheek. âI long'd to meet you, Peggy, though so shy, âI've watch'd your steps, and learn'd your history; âYou love your poor lame father, let that be âA happy presage of your love for me. âCome then, I'll stroll these meadows by your side, âI've seen enough to wish you for my bride, âAnd I must tell you soâNay, let me hold âThis guiltless hand, I prize it more than gold; âOf that I have my share, but fain would prove âThe sterling wealth of honourable love; âMy lands are fruitful, and my flocks increase, âMy house knows plenty, and my servants peace; âOne blessing more will crown my happy life, âLike Adam, pretty girl, I want a wife.â Need it be told his suit was not denied, With youth, and wealth, and candour on his side? Honour took charge of love so well begun, And accidental meetings, one by one, Increas'd so fast midst time's unheeded flight, That village rumour married them outright; Though wiser matrons, doubtful in debate, Pitied deluded Peggy's hapless fate. Friends took th' alarm, âAnd will he then disgrace âThe name of Brooks with this plebeian race?â Others, more lax in virtue, not in pride, Sported the wink of cunning on one side; âHe'll buy, no doubt, what Peggy has to sell, âA little gallantry becomes him well.â Meanwhile the youth, with self-determin'd aim, Disdaining fraud, and pride's unfeeling claim, Above control, pursued his generous way, And talk'd to Peggy of the marriage-day. Poor girl! she heard, with anguish and with doubt, What her too-knowing neighbours preach'd about, That Herbert would some nobler match prefer, And surely never, never marry her; Yet, with what trembling and delight she bore The kiss, and heard the vow, âI'll doubt no more;â âProtect me, Herbert, for your honour's sake âYou will,â she cried, ânor leave my heart to break.â Then wrote to uncle Gilbert, joys, and fears, And hope, and trust, and sprinkled all with tears. Rous'd was the dormant spirit of the brave, E'en lameness rose to succour and to save; For, though they both rever'd young Herbert's name, And knew his unexceptionable fame; And though the girl had honestly declar'd Love's first approaches, and their counsel shar'd, Yet, that he truly meant to take for life The poor and lowly Peggy for a wife; Or, that she was not doom'd to be deceiv'd, Was out of bounds:âit could not be believ'd. âGo, Gilbert, save her; I, you know, am lame; âGo, brother, go, and save my child from shame, âHaste, and I'll pray for your success the while, âGo, go;ââthen bang'd his crutch upon the stile:â It snapt.âE'en Gilbert trembled while he smote, Then whipt the broken end beneath his coat; âAye, aye, I'll settle them; I'll let them see âWho's to be conqu'ror this time, I or he!â Then off he set, and with enormous strides, Rebellious mutterings and oaths besides, O'er cloverfield and fallow, bank and briar, Pursu'd the nearest out, and fann'd the fire That burnt within him.âSoon the Hall he spied, And the grey willows by the water side; Nature cried âhalt!â nor could he well refuse; Stop, Gilbert, breathe awhile, and ask the news. âNews?â cried a stooping grandame of the vale, âAye, rare news too; I'll tell you such a tale; âBut let me rest; this bank is dry and warm; âDo you know Peggy Meldrum at the farm? âYoung Herbert's girl? He'as cloth'd her all in white, âYou never saw so beautiful a sight! âAh! he's a fine young man, and such a face! âI knew his grandfather and all his race; âHe rode a tall white horse, and look'd so big, âBut how shall I describe his hat and wig?â âPlague take his wig,â cried Gilbert, âand his hat, âWhere's Peggy Meldrum? can you tell me that?â âAye; but have patience, man! you'll hear anon, âFor I shall come to her as I go on, âSo hark'ye friend; his grandfather I say,ââ âPoh, poh,ââcried Gilbert, as he turn'd away. Her eyes were fix'd, her story at a stand, The snuff-box lay half open'd in her hand; âYou great, ill-manner'd clown! but I must bear it; âYou oaf; to ask the news, and then won't hear it!â But Gilbert had gain'd forty paces clear, When the reproof came murmuring on his ear. Again he ask'd the first that pass'd him by; A cow-boy stopt his whistle to reply. âWhy, I've a mistress coming home, that's all, âThey're playing Meg's diversion at the Hall; âFor master's gone, with Peggy, and his cousin, âAnd all the lady-folks, about a dozen, âTo church, down there; he'll marry one no doubt, âFor that it seems is what they're gone about; âI know it by their laughing and their jokes, âTho' they wor'nt ask'd at church like other folks.â Gilbert kept on, and at the Hall-door found The winking servants, where the jest went round: All expectation; aye, and so was he, But not with heart so merry and so free. The kitchen table, never clear from beef, Where hunger found its solace and relief, Free to all strangers, had no charms for him, For agitation worried every limb; Ale he partook, but appetite had none, And grey-hounds watch'd in vain to catch the bone. All sounds alarm'd him, and all thoughts perplex'd, With dogs, and beef, himself, and all things vex'd, Till with one mingled caw above his head, Their gliding shadows o'er the court-yard spread, The rooks by thousands rose: the bells struck up; He guess'd the cause, and down he set the cup, And listening, heard, amidst the general hum, A joyful exclamation, âHere they come!ââ Soon Herbert's cheerful voice was heard above, Amidst the rustling hand-maids of his love, And Gilbert follow'd without thought or dread, The broad oak stair-case thunder'd with his tread; Light tript the party, gay as gay could be, Amidst their bridal dressesâthere came he! And with a look that guilt could ne'er withstand, Approach'd his mece and caught her by the hand, âNow are you married, Peggy, yes or no? âTell me at once, before I let you go!â Abrupt he spoke, and gave her arm a swing, But the same moment felt the wedding ring, And stood confus'd.âShe wip'd th' empassion'd tear, âI am, I am; but is my father here?â Herbert stood by, and sharing with his bride, That perturbation which she strove to hide; âCome, honest Gilbert, you're too rough this time, âIndeed here's not the shadow of a crime; âBut where's your brother? When did you arrive? âWe waited long, for Nathan went at five!â All this was Greek to Gilbert, downright Greek; He knew not what to think, nor how to speak. The case was this; that Nathan with a cart To fetch them both at day-break was to start. And so he didâbut ere he could proceed, He suck'd a charming portion with a reed, Of that same wedding-ale, which was that day To make the hearts of all the village gay; Brim full of glee he trundled from the Hall, And as for sky-larks, he out-sung them all; Till growing giddy with his morning cup, He, stretch'd beneath a hedge, the reins gave up; The horse graz'd soberly without mishap, And Nathan had a most delightful nap For three good hoursâThen, doubting, when he woke, Whether his conduct would be deem'd a joke, With double haste perform'd just half his part, And brought the lame John Meldrum in his cart. And at the moment Gilbert's wrath was high, And while young Herbert waited his reply, The sound of rattling wheels was at the door; âThere's my dear father now,ââthey heard no more, The bridegroom glided like an arrow down, And Gilbert ran, though something of a clown, With his best step; and cheer'd with smiles and pray'rs, They bore old John in triumph up the stairs: Poor Peggy, who her joy no more could check, Clung like a dewy woodbine round his neck. And all stood silentâGilbert, off his guard, And marvelling at virtue's rich reward, Loos'd the one loop that held his coat before, Down thumpt the broken crutch upon the floor! They started, half alarm'd, scarce knowing why, But through the glist'ning rapture of his eye The bridegroom smil'd, then chid their simple fears, And rous'd the blushing Peggy from her tears; Around the uncle in a ring they came, And mark'd his look of mingled pride and shame. âNow honestly, good Gilbert, tell us true, âWhat meant this cudgel? What was it to do? âI know your heart suspected me of wrong, âAnd that most true affection urg'd along âYour feelings and your wrath; you were beside âTill now the rightful guardian of the bride. âBut why this cudgel?âââGuardian! that's the case, âOr else to-day I had not seen this place, âBut John about the girl was so perplex'd, âAnd I, to tell the truth, so mortal vex'd, âThat when he broke this crutch, and stampt and cried âFor John and Peggy, Sir, I could have died, âAye, that I could; for she was such a child, âSo tractable, so sensible, so mild, âThat if between you roguery had grown â(Begging your pardon,) 'twould have been your own; âShe would not hurt a fly.âSo off I came, âAnd had I found you injuring her fame, âAnd base enough to act as hundreds would, âTo ruin a poor maidâbecause you could, âWith this same cudgel, (you may smile or frown) âAn' please you, Sir, I meant to knock you down.â âA burst of laughter rang throughout the Hall, And Peggy's tongue, though overborne by all, Pour'd its warm blessings; for, without control The sweet unbridled transport of her soul Was obviously seen, till Herbert's kiss Stole, as it were, the eloquence of bliss. âWelcome, my friends; good Gilbert, here's my hand; âEat, drink, or rest, they're all at your command: âAnd whatsoever pranks the rest may play, âYou still shall be the hero of the day, âDoubts might torment, and blunders may have teaz'd, âLet my ale cure them; let us all be pleas'd. âAnd as for honest John, let me defend âThe father of my new, my bosom friend; âYou broke your crutch, well, well, worse luck might be, âI'll be your crutch, John Meldrum, lean on me, âAnd when your lovely daughter shall complain, âSend Gilbert's wooden argument again. âYou still may wonder that I take a wife âFrom the secluded walks of humble life, âOn reason's solid ground my love began, âAnd let the wise confute it if they can. âA girl I saw, with nature's untaught grace, âTurn from my gaze a most engaging face; âI saw her drop the tear, I knew full well âShe felt for you much more than she could tell. âI found her understanding, bright as day, âThrough all impediments still forc'd its way; âOn that foundation shall my hopes rely, âThe rock of genuine humility. âCall'd as she is to act a nobler part, âTo rule my household, and to share my heart, âI trust her prudence, confident to prove âDays of delight, and still unfading love; âAnd, while her inborn tenderness survives, âThat heav'nly charm of mothers and of wives, âI'll look for joy:âBut see, the neighbours all âCome posting on to share the festival; âAnd I'm determin'd, while the sun's so bright, âThat this shall be a wedding-day outright: âHow cheerly sound the bells! my charmer, come, âPartake their joy, and know yourself at home. âSit down, good John;âââI will,â the old man cried, âAnd let me drink to you, Sir, and the bride; âMy blessing on you: I am lame and old, âI can't make speeches, and I wo'n't be bold; âBut from my soul I wish and wish again, âThat brave good gentlemen would not disdain âThe poor, because they're poor: for, if they live âMidst crimes that parents never can forgive, âIf, like the forest beast, they wander wild, âTo rob a father, or to crush a child, âNature will speak, aye, just as Nature feels, âAnd wishâa Gilbert Meldrum at their heels.â SHOOTER'S HILL Sickness may be often an incentive to poetical composition; I found it so; and I esteem the following lines only because they remind me of past feelings, which I would not willingly forget.. I Health! I seek thee;âdost thou love The mountain-top or quiet vale, Or deign o'er humbler hills to rove On showery June's dark south-west gale? If so, I'll meet all blasts that blow, With silent step, but not forlorn; Though, goddess, at thy shrine I bow, And woo thee each returning morn. II I seek thee where, with all his might, The joyous bird his rapture tells, Amidst the half-excluded light, That gilds the fox-glove's pendant bells; Where cheerly up the bold hill's side The deep'ning groves triumphant climb; In groves Delight and Peace abide, And Wisdom marks the lapse of time. III To hide me from the public eye, To keep the throne of Reason clear, Amidst fresh air to breathe or die, I took my staff and wander'd here: Suppressing every sigh that heaves, And coveting no wealth but thee, I nestle in the honied leaves, And hug my stolen liberty. IV O'er eastward uplands, gay or rude, Along to Erith's ivied spire, I start, with strength and hope renew'd, And cherish life's rekindling fire. Now measure vales with straining eyes, Now trace the church-yard's humble names; Or, climb brown heaths, abrupt that rise, And overlook the winding Thames. V I love to mark the flow'ret's eye, To rest where pebbles form my bed, Where shapes and colours scatter'd lie, In varying millions round my head. The soul rejoices when alone, And feels her glorious empire free; Sees God in every shining stone, And revels in variety. VI Ah me! perhaps within my sight, Deep in the smiling dales below, Gigantic talents, Heav'n's pure light, And all the rays of genius glow In some lone soul, whom no one sees With power and will to say âArise,â Or chase away the slow disease, And Want's foul picture from his eyes. VII A worthier man by far than I, With more of industry and fire, Shall see fair Virtue's meed pass by, Without one spark of fame expire! Bleed not my heart, it will be so, The throb of care was thine full long; Rise, like the Psalmist from his woe, And pour abroad the joyful song. VIII Sweet Health, I seek thee! hither bring Thy balm that softens human ills; Come, on the long-drawn clouds that fling Their shadows o'er the Surry-Hills. Yon green-topt hills, and far away Where late as now I freedom stole, And spent one dear delicious day On thy wild banks, romantic Mole. IX Aye, there's the scene! Box-Hill, and the beautiful neighhourhood of Dorking, in Surry beyond the sweep Of London's congregated cloud, The dark-brow'd wood, the headlong steep, And valley-paths without a crowd! Here, Thames, I watch thy flowing tides, Thy thousand sails am proud to see; But where the Mole all silent glides Dwells Peaceâand Peace is wealth to me! X Of Cambrian mountains still I dream, And mouldering vestiges of war; By time-worn cliff or classic stream Would rove,âbut Prudence holds a bar. Come then, O Health! I'll strive to bound My wishes to this airy stand; 'Tis not for me to trace around The wonders of my native land. XI Yet, the loud torrent's dark retreat, Yet Grampian hills shall Fancy give, And, towering in her giddy seat, Amidst her own creation live, Live, if thou'lt urge my climbing feet, Give strength of nerve and vigorous breath, If not, with dauntless soul I meet The deep solemnity of death. XII This far-seen monumental tower Records th' achievements of the brave, And Angria's subjugated power, Who plunder'd on the eastern wave. I would not that such turrets rise To point out where my bones are laid; Save that some wandering bard might prize The comforts of its bread cool shade. XIII O Vanity! since thou'rt decreed Companion of our lives to be, I'll seek the moral songster's meed, An earthly immortality; Most vain!âO let me, from the past Remembering what to man is given, Lay Virtue's broad foundations fast, Whose glorious turrets reach to Hea'ven. MARY'S EVENING SIGH. I How bright with pearl the western sky How glorious far and wide, Yon lines of golden clouds that lie So peaceful side by side! Their deep'ning tints, the arch of light, All eyes with rapture see; E'en while I sigh I bless the sight That lures my love from me. II Green hill, that shad'st the valley here, Thou bear'st upon thy brow The only wealth to Mary dear, And all she'll ever know. There, in the crimson light I see, Above thy summit rise, My Edward's form, he looks to me A statue in the skies. III Descend, my love, the hour is come, Why linger on the hill? The sun hath left my quiet home, But thou can'st see him still; Yet why a lonely wanderer stray, Alone the joy pursue? The glories of the closing day Can charm thy Mary too. IV Dear Edward, when we stroll'd along Beneath the waving corn, And both confess'd the power of song, And bless'd the dewy morn; Your eye o'erflow'd, âHow sweet,â you cried, (My presence then could move) âHow sweet, with Mary by my side, âTo gaze and talk of love!â V Thou art not false! that cannot be; Yet I my rivals deem Each woodland charm, the moss, the tree, The silence, and the stream; Whate'er, my love, detams thee now, I'll yet forgive thy stay; But with to-morrow's dawn come thou, We'll brush the dews away. BARNHAM WATER. I Fresh from the Hall of Bounty sprung On a sultry afternoon, late in the summer of 1802, Euston-Hall lay in my way to Thetford, which place I did not reach until the evening, on a visit to my sister: the lines lose much of their interest except they could be read on the spot, or at least at a corresponding season of the year, With glowing heart and ardent eye, With song and rhyme upon my tongue, And fairy visions dancing by, The mid-day sun in all his pow'r The backward valley painted gay; Mine was a road without a flower, Where one small streamlet cross'd the way. II What was it rous'd my soul to love? What made the simple brook so dear? It glided like the weary dove, And never brook seem'd half so clear. Cool pass'd the current o'er my feet, Its shelving brink for rest was made, But every charm was incomplete, For Barnham Water wants a shade. III There, faint beneath the fervid sun, I gaz'd in ruminating mood; For who can see the current run And snatch no feast of mental food? âKeep pure thy soul,â it seem'd to say, âKeep that fair path by wisdom trod, âThat thou may'st hope to wind thy way, âTo fame worth boasting, and to God.â IV Long and delightful was the dream, A waking dream that Fancy yields, Till with regret I left the stream, And plung'd across the barren fields; To where of old rich abbeys smil'd In all the pomp of gothic taste, By fond tradition proudly styl'd, The mighty âCity in the East.â V Near, on a slope of burning sand, The shepherd boys had met to play, To hold the plains at their command, And mark the trav'ller's leafless way. The trav'ller with a cheerful look Would every pining thought forbear, If boughs but shelter'd Barnham brook He'd stop and leave his blessing there. VI The Danish mounds of partial green, Still, as each mouldering tower decays, Far o'er the bleak unwooded scene Proclaim their wond'rous length of days, My burning feet, my aching sight, Demanded rest,âwhy did I weep? The moon arose, and such a night! Good Heav'n! it was a sin to sleep. VII All rushing came thy hallow'd sighs, Sweet Melancholy, from my breast; â'Tis here that eastern greatness lies, âThat Might, Renown, and Wisdom rest! âHere funeral rites the priesthood gave âTo chiefs who sway'd prodigious powers, âThe Bigods and the Mowbrays brave, âFrom Framlingham's imperial towers.â VIII Full of the mighty deeds of yore, I bade good night the trembling beam; Fancy e'en heard the battle's roar, Of what but slaughter could I dream? Bless'd be that night, that trembling beam, Peaceful excursions Fancy made; All night I heard the bubbling stream, Yet, Barnham Water wants a shade. IX Whatever hurts my country's fame, When wits and mountaineers deride, To me grows serious, for I name My native plains and streams with pride. No mountain charms have I to sing, No loftier minstrel's rights invade; From trifles oft my raptures spring; âSweet Barnham Water wants a shade. A VISIT TO RANELAGH. I To Ranelagh, once in my life, By good-natur'd force I was driv'n; The nations had ceas'd their long strife, And Peace A grand Fete, in honour of the peace of 1802. beam'd her radiance from Heav'n What wonders were there to be found That a clown might enjoy or disdain? First we trac'd the gay ring all around, Ayeâand then we went round it again. II A thousand feet rustled on mats, A carpet that once had been green; Men bow'd with their outlandish hats, With corners so fearfully keen! Fair maids, who at home in their haste Had left all clothing else but a train, Swept the floor clean, as slowly they pac'd, And thenâwalk'd round and swept it again. III The music was truly enchanting! Right glad was I when I came near it; But in fashion I found I was wanting:â 'Twas the fashion to walk and not hear it! A fine youth, as beauty beset him, Look'd smilingly round on the train; âThe king's nephew,â they cried, as they met him Thenâwe went round and met him again. IV Huge paintings of Heroes and Peace Seem'd to smile at the sound of the fiddle, Proud to fill up each tall shining space Round the lanthorn The intervals between the pillars in the centre of the Rotunda were filled up by transparent paintings. that stood in the middle. And George's head too; Heav'n screen him! May he finish in peace his long reign! And what did we when we had seen him? Whyâwent round and saw him again. V A bell rang, announcing new pleasures, A crowd in an instant prest hard, Feathers nodded, perfumes shed their treasures, Round a door that led into the yard. 'Twas peopled all o'er in a minute, As a white flock would cover a plain! We had seen every soul that was in it, Then we went round and saw them again. VI But now came a scene worth the showing, The fireworks! midst laughs and huzzas, With explosions the sky was all glowing, Then down stream'd a million of stars; With a rush the bright rockets ascended, Wheels spurted blue fires like a rain; We turn'd with regret when 'twas ended, Thenâstar'd at each other again. VII There thousands of gay lamps aspir'd To the tops of the trees and beyond; And, what was most hugely admir'd, They look'd all up-side-down in a pond! The blaze scarce an eagle could bear; And an owl had most surely been slain; We return'd to the circle, and thereâ And there we went round it again. VIII 'Tis not wisdom to love without reason, Or to censure without knowing why: I had witness'd no crime, nor no treason, âO life, 'tis thy picture,â said I. 'Tis just thus we saunter along, Months and years bring their pleasure or pain; We sigh midst the right and the wrong; âAnd then we go round them again! THE WOODLAND HALLÃ. (PERHAPS) ADAPTED FOR MUSIC. I In our cottage, that peeps from the skirts of the wood, I am mistress, no mother have I; Yet blithe are my days, for my father is good, And kind is my lover hard by; They both work together beneath the green shade, Both woodmen, my father and Joe: Where I've listen'd whole hours to the echo that made So much of a laugh orâHallÃ³. II From my basket at noon they expect their supply, And with joy from my threshold I spring; For the woodlands I love, and the oaks waving high, And Echo that sings as I sing. Though deep shades delight me, yet love is my food, As I call the dear name of my Joe; His musical shout is the pride of the wood, And my heart leaps to hear theâHallÃ³. III Simple flowers of the grove, little birds live at ease, I wish not to wander from you; I'll still dwell beneath the deep roar of your trees, For I know that my Joe will be true. The trill of the robin, the coo of the dove, Are charms that I'll never forego; But resting through life on the bosom of love, Will remember the Woodland HallÃ³. ODE TO PEACE. WRITTEN ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE PRELIMINARIES, IN 1802. I Halt! ye Legions, sheathe your Steel: Blood grows precious; shed no more: Cease your toils; your wounds to heal, Lo! beams of Mercy reach the shore! From Realms of everlasting light The favour'd guest of Heaven is come: Prostrate your Banners at the sight, And bear the glorious tidings home. II The plunging corpse, with half-clos'd eyes, No more shall stain th' unconscious brine; Yon pendant gay that streaming flies, Around its idle Staff shall twine. Behold! along th'ethereal sky Her beams o'er conquering Navies spread; Peace! Peace! the leaping Sailors cry, With shouts that might arouse the dead. III Then forth Britannia's thunder pours; A vast reiterated sound! From Line to Line the Cannon roars, And spreads the blazing joy around. Return, ye brave! your Country calls; Return, return, your task is done: While here the tear of transport falls, To grace your Laurels nobly won. IV Albion Cliffsâfrom age to age, That bear the roaring storms of Heaven, Did ever fiercer Warfare rage, Was ever Peace more timely given? Wake, sounds of Joy! rouse, generous Isle! Let every patriot bosom glow. Beauty, resume thy wonted smile, And, Poverty, thy cheerful brow. V Boast, Britain, of thy glorious Guests; Peace, Wealth, and Commerce, all thine own Still on contented Labour rests The basis of a lasting Throne. Shout, Poverty! 'tis Heaven that saves; Protected Wealth, the chorus raise, Ruler of War, of Winds, and Waves, Accept a prostrate Nation's praise. LOVE OF THE COUNTRY. WRITTEN AT CLARE-HALL, HERTS, JUNE, 1804. I Welcome silence! welcome peace! O most welcome, holv shade! Thus I prove, as years Increase, My heart and soul for quiet made. Thus I fix my firm belief While rapture's gushing tears descend, That every flower and every leaf Is moral Truth's unerring friend. II I would not for a world of gold That Nature's lovely face should tire; Fountain of blessings yet untold; Pure source of intellectual fire! Fancy's fair buds, the germs of song, Unquicken'd midst the world's rude strife, Shall sweet retirement render strong, And morning silence bring to life. III Then tell me not that I shall grow Forlorn, that fields and woods will cloy; From Nature and her changes flow An everlasting tide of joy. I grant that summer heats will burn, That keen will come the frosty night; But both shall please: and each in turn Yield Reason's most supreme delight IV Build me a shrine, and I could kneel To Rural Gods, or prostrate fall; Did I not see, did I not feel, That one Great Spirit governs all. O Heaven permit that I may lie Where o'er my corse green branches wave; And those who from life's tumult fly With kindred feelings press my grave. END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</field>

OF STOUT'S HILL, ULEY, AND HIS EXCELLENT LADY; AND ROBERT BRANSBY COOPER, ESQ. OF FERNEY HILL, DURSLEY, IN THE COUNTY OF GLOUCESTER, AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY; THIS JOURNAL IS DEDICATED, WITH SENTIMENTS OF HIGH ESTEEM, AND A LIVELY RECOLLECTION OF PAST PLEASURES, BY THEIR HUMBLE SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. BOOK I. The Vale of UleyâForest of DeanâRossâWilton Castleâ Goodrich CastleâCourtfield, Welsh Bicknor, Coldwellâ Gleaner's SongâColdwell RocksâSymmon's YatâGreat DowardâNew WierâMartin's WellâThe CoracleâArrival at Monmouth. âRouse from thy slumber, Pleasure calls, arise, Quit thy half-rural bower, a while despise The thraldom that consumes thee. We who dwell Far from thy land of smoke advise thee well. Here Nature's bounteous hand around shall fling Scenes that thy Muse hath never dared to sing. When sickness weigh'd thee down, and strength declined; When dread eternity absorb'd thy mind, Flow'd the predicting verse, by gloom o'erspread, That âCambrian mountainsâ thou shouldst never tread, That âtime-woru cliff and classic stream to see,â Was wealth's prerogative, despair for thee. Come to the proof; with us the breeze inhale, Renounce despair, and come to Severn's vale; And where the Cotswold Hills are stretch'd along, Seek our green dell, as yet unknown to song: Start hence with us, and trace, with raptured eye, The wild meanderings of the beauteous Wye; Thy ten days leisure ten days joy shall prove, And rock and stream breathe amity and love.â Such was the call; with instant ardour hail'd, The siren Pleasure caroll'd and prevail'd; Soon the deep dell appear'd, and the clear brow Of Uley Bury Bury, or Burg, the Saxon name for a hill, particularly for one wholly or partially formed by art. Uley Bury, from the singular valley below, embosoming Uley and Oulpen, is an eminence of singular beauty, crowned by intrenchments; though in itself but a kind of termination of the Cotswold Hills, in which character Stinchcombe takes the lead; and both command a vast prospect over the Severn and the mountains of South Wales. smiled o'er all below, O'er mansion, flock, and circling woods that hung Round the sweet pastures where the sky-lark sung. O for the fancy, vigorous and sublime, Chaste as the theme, to triumph over time! Bright as the rising day, and firm as truth, To speak new transports to the lowland youth, That bosoms still might throb, and still adore, When his who strives to charm them beats no more! One August morn, with spirits high, Sound health, bright hopes, and cloudless sky, A cheerful group their farewell bade To Dursley tower, to Uley's shade; And where bold Stinchcombe's greenwood side Heaves in the van of highland pride, Scour'd the broad vale of Severn; where The foes of verse shall never dare Genius to scorn, or bound its power, There blood-stain'd Berkeley's turrets low'r, A name that cannot pass away, Till time forgets âthe Bardâ of Gray. Quitting fair Glo'ster's northern road, To gain the pass of Framilode, Before us Dean's black forest spread, And May Hill, with his tufted head, Beyond the ebbing tide appear'd; And Cambria's distant mountains rear'd Their dark blue summits far away; And Severn, 'midst the burning day, Curved his bright line, and bore along The mingled Avon, pride of song. The trembling steeds soon ferried o'er, Neigh'd loud upon the forest shore; Domains that once, at early morn, Rang to the hunter's bugle horn, When barons proud would bound away; And even kings would hail the day, When crested chiefs their bright arm'd train Of javelin'd horsemen roused amain, And chasing wide the wolf or boar, Bade the deep woodland valleys roar. But we no dang'rous chase pursued; Sound wheels and hoofs their tasks renew'd; Behind roll'd Severn, gleaming far, Around us roar'd no sylvan war, 'Mid depths of shade, gay sunbeams broke Through noble Flaxley's bow'rs of oak; And many a cottage, trim and gay, Whisper'd delight through all the way; On hills exposed, in dells unseen, To patriarchal Mitchel Dean. Rose-cheek'd Pomona here was queen, Though Ceres edged her fields between, And on each hill-top, mounted high, Her sickle waved in ecstasy; Till, Ross, thy charms all hearts confess'd, Thy peaceful walks, thy hours of rest And contemplation. Here the mind, (Its usual luggage left behind,) Feels all its dormant fires revive, And sees âthe Man of Rossâ alive; And hears the Twick'nham Bard again To Kyrle's high virtues lift his strain; Whose own hand clothed this far-famed hill With rev'rend elms, that shade us still; Whose mem'ry shall survive the day When elms and empires feel decay. Kyrle die, by Bard ennobled? Never: The Man of Ross shall live for ever; And long that spire shall time defy, To grace the flow'ry-margin'd Wye, Scene of the morrow's joy, that prest Its unseen beauties on our rest In dreams; but who of dreams would tell, Where truth sustains the song so well The carriages were sent forward to meet the party at Chepstow.? The morrow came, and Beauty's eye Ne'er beam'd upon a lovelier sky; Imagination instant brought, And dash'd, amidst the train of thought, Tints of the bow. The boatman stript; Glee at the helm exulting tript, And waved her flower-encircled wand, âAway, away, to Fairy Land.â Light dipt the oars; but who can name The various objects dear to fame, That changing, doubling, wild, and strong, Demand the noblest powers of song? Then, O forgive the vagrant Muse, Ye who the sweets of Nature choose; And thou, whom destiny hath tied To this romantic river's side, Down gazing from each close retreat, On boats that glide beneath thy feet, Forgive the stranger's meagre line, That seems to slight that spot of thine; For he, alas! could only glean The changeful outlines of the scene; A momentary bliss; and here Links memory's power with rapture's tear. Who curb'd the barons' kingly power Henry the Seventh gave an irrevocable blow to the dangerous privileges assumed by the barons, in abolishing liveries and retainers, by which every malefactor could shelter himself from the law, on assuming a nobleman's livery, and attending his person. And as a finishing stroke to the feudal tenures, an act was passed, by which the barons and gentlemen of landed interest were at liberty to sell and mortgage their lands, without fines or licences for the alienation.? Let hist'ry tell that fateful hour At home, when surly winds shall roar, And prudence shut the study door. De Wiltons here, of mighty name, The whelming flood, the summer stream, Mark'd from their towers.âThe fabric falls, The rubbish of their splendid halls Time in his march hath scatter'd wide, And blank oblivion strives to hide The ruins of Wilton Castle stand on the opposite side of the river, nearly fronting the town of Ross.. A while the grazing herd was seen, And trembling willow's silver green, Till the fantastic current stood In line direct for Pencraig Wood; Whose bold green summit welcome bade, Then rear'd behind his nodding shade. Here, as the light boat skimm'd along, The clarionet, and chosen song, (That mellow, wild, Ãolian lay, âSweet in the Woodlands,â) roll'd away Their echoes down the stream, that bore Each dying close to every shore, And forward cape, and woody range, That form the never-ceasing change, To him who floating, void of care, Twirls with the stream, he knows not where. Till bold, impressive, and sublime, Gleam'd all that's left by storms and time Of Goodrich Towers. The mould'ring pile Tells noble truths,âbut dies the while. O'er the steep path, through brake and brier, His batter'd turrets still aspire, In rude magnificence. 'Twas here Lancastrian Henry spread his cheer, When came the news that Hal was born, And Monmouth hail'd th' auspicious morn: A boy in sports, a prince in war, Wisdom and valour crown'd his car; Of France the terror, England's glory, As Stratford's bard has told the story. No butler's proxies snore supine, Where the old monarch kept his wine; No Welsh ox roasting, horns and all, Adorns his throng'd and laughing hall; But where he pray'd, and told his beads, A thriving ash luxuriant spreads. No wheels by piecemeal brought the pile; No barks embowell'd Portland Isle; Dig, cried experience, dig away, Bring the firm quarry into day; The excavation still shall save Those ramparts which its entrails gave. âHere Kings shall dwell,â the builders cried, âHere England's foes shall lower their pride; âHither shall suppliant nobles come, âAnd this be England's royal home.â Vain hope! for on the Gwentian shore The regal banner streams no more! Nettles, and vilest weeds that grow, To mock poor grandeur's head laid low, Creep round the turrets valour raised, And flaunt where youth and beauty gazed. Here fain would strangers loiter long, And muse as Fancy's woof grows strong; Yet cold the heart that could complain, Where Pollett The boatman. struck his oars again; For lovely as the sleeping child, The stream glides on sublimely wild, In perfect beauty, perfect ease. âThe awning trembled in the breeze, And scarcely trembled, as we stood For Ruerdean Spire and Bishop's Wood. The fair domains of Courtfield A seat belonging to the family of Vaughan, which is not unnoticed in the pages of history. According to tradition, it is the place where Henry the Fifth was nursed, under the care of the Countess of Salisbury, from which circumstance the original name of Grayfield is said to have been changed to Courtfield This is probably an erroneous tradition; for Court was a common name for a manor-house, where the lord of the manor held his court.âCoxe's Monmouth.. made A paradise of mingled shade Round Bicknor's tiny church, that cowers Beneath his host of woodland bowers. But who the charm of words shall fling O'er Raven Cliff, and Coldwell Spring, To brighten the unconscious eye, And wake the soul to ecstasy? Noon scorch'd the fields; the boat lay to; The dripping oars had nought to do, Where round us rose a scene that might Enchant an idiotâglorious sight! Here, in one gay according mind, Upon the sparkling stream we dined; As shepherds free on mountain heath, Free as the fish that watch'd beneath For falling crums, where cooling lay The wine that cheer'd us on our way. Th' unruffled bosom of the stream Gave every tint and every gleam; Gave shadowy rocks, and clear blue sky, And double clouds of various dye; Gave dark green woods, or russet brown, And pendent corn-fields, upside down. A troop of gleaners changed their shade, And 'twas a change by music made; For slowly to the brink they drew, To mark our joy, and share it too. How oft, in childhood's flow'ry days, I've heard the wild impassion'd lays Of such a group, lays strange and new, And thought, was ever song so true! When from the hazel's cool retreat They watch'd the summer's trembling heat; And through the boughs rude urchins play'd, Where matrons, round the laughing maid, Prest the long grass beneath! And here Perhaps they shared an equal cheer; Enjoy'd the feast with equal glee, And raised the song of revelry: Yet half abash'd, reserved, and shy, Watch'd till the strangers glided by. GLEANER'S SONG. Dear Ellen, your tales are all plenteously stored With the joys of some bride, and the wealth of her lord: Of her chariots and dresses, And worldly caresses, And servants that fly when she's waited upon: But what can she boast if she weds unbeloved? Can she e'er feel the joy that one morning I proved, When I put on my new-gown and waited for John? These fields, my dear Ellen, I knew them of yore, Yet to me they ne'er look'd so enchanting before; The distant bells ringing, The birds round us singing, For pleasure is pure when affection is won: They told me the troubles and cares of a wife; But I loved him; and that was the pride of my life, When I put on my new-gown and waited for John. He shouted and ran, as he leapt from the stile; And what in my bosom was passing the while? For love knows the blessing Of ardent caressing, When virtue inspires us, and doubts are all gone. The sunshine of Fortune you say is divine; True love and the sunshine of Nature were mine, When I put on my new-gown and waited for John. Never could spot be suited less To bear memorials of distress; None, cries the sage, more fit is found, They strike at once a double wound; Humiliation bids you sigh, And think of poor mortality. Close on the bank, and half o'ergrown, Beneath a dark wood's sombrous frown, A monumental stone appears Of one who, in his blooming years, While bathing spurn'd the grassy shore, And sunk, 'midst friends, to rise no more. By parents witness'd.âHark! their shrieks! The dreadful language horror speaks! But why in verse attempt to tell That tale the stone records so well Inscription on the side towards the water. âSacred to the memory of John Whitehead Warre, who perished near this spot, whilst bathing in the river Wye, in sight of his afflicted parents, brother, and sisters, on the 14th of September, 1804, in the sixteenth year of his age. âGOD'S WILL BE DONE, Who, in his mercy, hath granted consolation to the parents of the dear departed, in the reflection that he possessed truth, innocence, filial piety, and Fraternal affection, in the highest degree. That, but a few moments before he was called to a better life, he had (with a never to be forgotten piety) joined his family in joyful thanks to his Maker, for the restoration of his mother's health. His parents, in justice to his amiable virtue and excellent disposition, declare, that he was void of offence towards them. With humbled hearts they bow to the Almighty's dispensation; trusting, through the mediation of his blessed Son, he will mercifully receive their child he so suddenly took to himself. âThis monument is here erected to warn parents and others how they trust the deceitful stream; and particularly to exhort them to learn and observe the directions of the Humane Society, for the recovery of persons apparently drowned. Alas! it is with the extremest sorrow here commemorated, what anguish is felt from a want of this knowledge. The lamented youth swam very well; was endowed with great bodily strength and activity; and possibly, had proper application been used, might have been saved from his untimely fate. He was born at Oporto, in the kingdom of Portugal, on the 14th of February, 1789; third son of James Warre, of London, and of the county of Somerset, merchant, and Elinor, daughter of Thomas Gregg, of Belfast, Esq. âPassenger, whoever thou art, spare this tomb! It is erected for the benefit of the surviving, being but a poor record of the grief of those who witnessed the sad occasion of it. God preserve you and yours from such calamity! May you not require their assistance; but if you should, the apparatus, with directions for the application by the Humane Society, for the saving of persons apparently drowned, are lodged at the church of Coldwell.â On the opposite side is inscribed, âIt is with gratitude acknowledged by the parents of the deceased, that permission was gratuitously, and most obligingly, granted for the erection of this monument, by William Vaughan, Esq. of Courtfield.â? Nothing could damp th'awaken'd joy, Not e'en thy fate, ingenuous boy; The great, the grand of Nature strove, To lift our hearts to life and love. Hail! Coldwell rocks; frown, frown away; Thrust from your woods your shafts of grey: Fall not, to crush our mortal pride, Or stop the stream on which we glide. Our lives are short, our joys are few. But, giants, what is time to you? Ye who erect, in many a mass, Rise from the scarcely dimpled glass, That with distinct and mellow glow Reflects your monstrous forms below; Or in clear shoals, in breeze or sun, Shakes all your shadows into one; Boast ye o'er man in proud disdain, A silent, everlasting reign? Bear ye your heads so high in scorn Of names that puny man hath borne? Proud rocks! had Cambria's bards but here Their names engraven, deep and clear, That such as gaily wind along Might greet with shouts those sires of song, And trace the fame that mortals crave To LIGHT and LIFE beyond the grave! Then might ye boast your wreaths entwined With trophies of the deathless MIND; Then would your fronts record on high, âWe perish!âMan can never die!â Not nameless quite ye lift your brows, For each the navigator knows; Not by King Arthur, or his knights, Bard famed in lays, or chief in fights; But former tourists, just as free, (Though surely not so blest as we,) A group of wranglers from the bar, Suspending here their mimic warâ Mark'd towering Bearcroft's ivy crown, And grey Vansittart's waving gown: And who's that giant by his side? âSergeant Adair,â the boatman cried. Yet strange it seems, however true, That here, where law has nought to do, Where rules and bonds are set aside, By wood, by rock, by stream defied; That here, where nature seems at strife With all that tells of busy life, Man should by names be carried still To Babylon against his will. But how shall memory rehearse, Or dictate the untoward verse That truth demands? Could he refuse Thy unsought honours, darling Muse, Who thus, in idle, happy trim Rode just where friends would carry him, And thus hath since his cares beguiled By rhymes as joyous, and as wild? Truth he obeys. The generous band, That spread his board and grasp'd his hand, In native mirth, as here they came, Gave a bluff rock his humble name: A yew-tree clasps its rugged base; The boatman knows its reverend face; With Pollett's memory and his fee, Rests the result that time shall see. Yet, whether time shall sweep away The fragile whimsies of a day; Or future travellers rest the oar, To hear the mingled echoes roar A stranger's triumph! He will feel A joy that death alone can steal. And should he cold indifference feigu, And treat such honours with disdain, Pretending pride shall not deceive him, Good people all, pray don't believe him; In such a spot to leave a name, At least is no opprobrious fame; This rock perhaps uprear'd his brow, Ere human blood began to flow. Nor let the wandering stranger fear That Wye here ends her wild career; Though closing boughs,âthough hills may seem To bar all egress to the stream, Some airy height he climbs amain, And finds the silver eel again. No fears we form'd, no labours counted, Yet Symmon's Yat must be surmounted; A tower of rock, that seems to cry, âGo round about me, neighbour Wye This rocky isthmus, perforated at the base, would measure not more than six hundred yards, and its highest point is two thousand feet above the water. If this statement, taken from Coxe's History of Monmouthshire, and an Excursion down the Wye, by C. Heath, of Monmouth, is correct, its elevation is greater than that of the âPen y Vale,â or âSugar-Loaf Mountain,â near Abergavenny. Yet it has less the appearance of a mountain than the river has that of an excavation. It is probable that some error has crept into the publications above named..â On went the boat, and up the steep Her straggling crew began to creep, To gain the ridge, enjoy the view, Where the fresh gales of summer blew. The gleaming Wye, that circles round Her four-mile course, again is found; And, crouching to the conqueror's pride, Bathes his huge cliffs on either side; Seen at one glance, when from his brow The eye surveys twin gulfs below. Whence comes thy name? What Symon he, Who gain'd a monument in thee? Perhaps a wild-wood hunter,âborn Peril, and toil, and death to scorn; Or warrior, with his powerful lance, Who scaled the cliff to mark th' advance Of rival arms; or humble swain, Who sought for pasture here in vain; Or venerable bard, who strove To tune his harp to themes of love; Or with a poet's ardent flame Sung to the winds his country's fame? Westward Great Doward, stretching wide, Upheaves his iron-bowell'd side; And by his everlasting mound Prescribes th'imprison'd river's bound, And strikes the eye with mountain force: But, stranger, mark thy rugged course From crag to crag, unwilling, slow, To New Wier forge, that smokes below. Here rush'd the keel like lightning by: The helmsman watch'd with anxious eye; And oars alternate touch'd the brim, To keep the flying boat in trim. Forward quick changing, changing still, Again rose cliff, and wood, and hill, Where mingling foliage seem'd to strive With dark-brown saplings, flay'd alive The custom is here alluded to of stripping the bark from oaks while growing, which gives an almost undescribable, though not the most agreeable, effect to the landscape., Down to the gulf beneath; where oft The toiling wood-boy dragg'd aloft His stubborn faggot from the brim, And gazed, and tugg'd with sturdy limb; And where the mind repose would seek, A barren, storm-defying peak, The Little Doward, lifted high His rocky crown of royalty. Hush! not a whisper! Oars, be still! Comes that soft sound from yonder hill? Or is the sound so faint, though near It scarcely strikes the list'ning ear? E'en so; for down the green bank fell An ice-cold stream from Martin's Well, Bright as young beauty's azure eye, And pure as infant chastity; Each limpid draught suffused with dew The dipping glass's crystal hue; And as it trembling reach'd the lip, Delight sprung up at every sip. Pure, temperate joys, and calm, were these We toss'd upon no Indian seas; No savage chiefs, with tawny crew, Came jabbering in the bark canoe Our strength to dare, our course to turn; Yet boats a South Sea chief would burn In CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, mention is made of boats of this description, formed of a raw hide, (from whence, perhaps, their name Coracle) which were in use among the natives. How little they dreamed of the vastness of modern perfection, and of the naval conflicts of latter days! Sculk'd in the alder shade. Each bore, Devoid of keel, or sail, or oar, An upright fisherman, with eye Of Bramin-like solemnity; Who scann'd the surface either way, And cleaved it like a fly at play; And crossways bore a balanced pole, To drive the salmon from his hole; Then heedful leap'd, without parade, On shore, as luck or fancy bade; And o'er his back, in gallant trim, Swung the light shell that carried him; Then down again his burden threw, And launch'd his whirling bowl anew; Displaying, in his bow'ry station, The infancy of navigation. Soon round us spread the hills and dales Where Geoffrey spun his magic tales, And call'd them history. The land Whence Arthur sprung, and all his band Of gallant knights. Sire of romance, Who led the fancy's mazy dance, Thy tales shall please, thy name still be, When Time forgets my verse and me. Low sunk the sun, his ev'ning beam Scarce reach'd us on the tranquil stream: Shut from the world, and all its din, Nature's own bonds had closed us in; Wood, and deep dell, and rock, and ridge, From smiling Ross to Monmouth Bridge; From morn, till twilight stole away, A long, unclouded, glorious day.

Harry of Monmouth, o'er thy page, Great chieftain of a daring age! The stripling soldier burns to see The spot of thy nativity; His ardent fancy can restore Thy castle's turrets, (now no more); See the tall plumes of victory wave, And call old valour from the grave; Twang the strong bow, and point the lance, That pierced the shatter'd hosts of France, When nations, in the days of yore, Shook at the rampant lion's roar. Ten hours were all we could command; The boat was moor'd upon the strand; The midnight current, by her side, Was stealing down to meet the tide; The wakeful steersman ready lay, To rouse us at the break of day: It cameâhow soon! and what a sky, To cheer the bounding traveller's eye! To make him spurn his couch of rest, To shout upon the river's breast, Watching by turns the rosy hue Of early cloud, or sparkling dew. These living joys the verse shall tell: Harry, and Monmouth, fare-ye-well. On upland farm, and airy height, Swept by the breeze, and clothed in light, The reapers, early from their beds, Perhaps were singing o'er our heads. For, stranger, deem not that the eye Could hence survey the eastern sky; Or mark the streak'd horizon's bound, Where first the rosy sun wheels round. Deep in the gulf beneath were we, Whence climb'd blue mists o'er rock and tree; A mingling, undulating crowd, That form'd the dense or fleecy cloud; Slow from the darken'd stream upborne, They caught the quickening gales of morn; There bade their parent Wye good day, And, tinged with purple, sail'd away. The Munno The river Munno, or Mynnow, falls into the Wye, near Monmouth. join'd us all unseen. Troy House, and Beaufort's bowers of green, And nameless prospects, half defined, Involved in mist, were left behind. Yet as the boat still onward bore, The ramparts of the eastern shore Cower'd the high crest to many a sweep, And bade us o'er each minor steep Mark the bold Kymin's sunny brow, That, gleaming o'er our fogs below, Lifted amain, with giant power, E'en to the clouds his Naval Tower The Kymin Pavilion, erected in honour of the British admirals, and their unparalleled victories.; Proclaiming to the morning sky Valour, and fame, and victory. The air resign'd its hazy blue, Just as Landoga came in view. Delightful village! one by one, Thy climbing dwellings caught the sun. So bright the scene, the air so clear, Young Love and Joy seem'd station'd here; And each with floating banners cried, âStop, friends, you'll meet the rushing tide.â Rude fragments, torn, disjointed, wild, High on the Glo'ster shore are piled. No mouldering fane, the boast of years, Unstain'd by time, the wreck appears: With pouring wrath, and hideous swell, Down foaming from a woodland dell, A summer flood's resistless pow'r Raised the grim ruin in an hour! When that o'erwhelming tempest spread Its terrors round the guilty head, When earth-bound rocks themselves gave way, When crash'd the prostrate timbers lay, O, it had been a noble sight, Crouching beyond the torrent's might, To mark th' uprooted victims bow, The grinding masses dash below, And hear the long deep peal the while Burst over Tintern's roofless pile! Then, as the sun regain'd his power, When the last breeze from hawthorn bower, Or Druid oak, had shook away The rain-drops 'midst the gleaming day, Perhaps the sigh of hope return'd, And love in some chaste bosom burn'd, And softly trill'd, the stream along, Some rustic maiden's village song. THE MAID OF LANDOGA. Return, my Llewellyn! the glory That heroes may gain o'er the sea, Though nations may feel Their invincible steel, By falsehood is tarnish'd in story; Why tarry, Llewellyn, from me? Thy sails, on the fathomless ocean, Are swell'd by the boisterous gale: How rests thy tired head On the rude rocking bed? While here not a leaf is in motion, And melody reigns in the dale. The mountains of Monmouth invite thee; The Wye, O how beautiful here! This woodbine, thine own, Hath the cottage o'ergrown. O what foreign shore can delight thee, And where is the current so clear? Can lands, where false pleasure assails thee, And beauty invites thee to roam; Can the deep orange grove Charm with shadows of love? Thy love at Landoga bewails thee; Remember her truth and thy home. Adieu, Landoga, scene most dear. Farewell we bade to Ethell's Wier; Round many a point then bore away, Till morn was changed to beauteous day: And forward on the lowland shore, Silent, majestic ruins, wore The stamp of holiness; this strand The steersman hail'd, and touch'd the land. Sudden the change; at once to tread The grass-grown mansions of the dead! Awful to feeling, where, immense, Rose ruin'd, gray magnificence; The fair-wrought shaft all ivy-bound, The towering arch with foliage crown'd, That trembles on its brow sublime, Triumphant o'er the spoils of time. Here, grasping all the eye beheld, Thought into mingling anguish swell'd, And check'd the wild excursive wing, O'er dust or bones of priest or king; Or raised some blood-stain'd There is shown here a mutilated figure, which they call the famous Earl Strongbow; but it appears from Coxe that he was buried at Gloucester. warrior's ghost To shout before his banner'd host. But all was still.âThe chequer'd floor Shall echo to the step no more; Nor airy roof the strain prolong Of vesper chant or choral song. Tintern, thy name shall hence sustain A thousand raptures in my brain; Joys, full of soul, all strength, all eye, That cannot fade, that cannot die. No loitering here, lone walks to steal; Ours was the early hunter's meal; For time and tide, stern couple, ran Their endless race, and laugh'd at man; Deaf, had we shouted, âturn about,â Or, âwait awhile, till we come out:â To humour them we check'd our pride, And ten cheer'd hearts stow'd side by side, Push'd from the shore with current strong, And âHey for Chepstow,â steer'd along. Amidst the bright expanding day, The solemn, deep, dark shadows lay Of that rich foliage, tow'ring o'er Where princely abbots dwelt of yore. The mind, with instantaneous glance, Beholds his barge of state advance. Borne proudly down the ebbing tide, She sweeps the waving boughs aside; She winds with flowing pendants drest; And as the current turns south-west, She strikes her oars, where, full in view, Stupendous Wind-Cliff greets her crew. But, Fancy, let thy day-dreams cease; With fallen greatness be at peace. Enough; for Wind-Cliff still was found To hail us as we doubled round. Bold in primeval strength he stood; His rocky brow, all shagg'd with wood, O'erlook'd his base, where, doubling strong, The inward torrent pours along; Then ebbing turns, and turns again, (To meet the Severn and the Main) Beneath the dark shade sweeping round Of beetling Persfield's fairy ground, By buttresses of rock upborne, The rude Apostles all unshorn Twelve projecting rocks so named, fringed with foliage nearly to the water's edge.. Long be the slaught'ring axe defied: Long may they bear their waving pride; Tree over tree, bower over bower, In uncurb'd nature's wildest power; Till Wye forgets to wind below, And genial spring to bid them grow. And shall we e'er forget the day, When our last chorus died away? When first we hail'd, then moor'd beside Rock-founded Chepstow's mouldering pride? Where that strange bridge âOn my arrival at Chepstow,â says Mr. Coxe, âI walked to the bridge; it was low water, and I looked down on the river ebbing between forty and fifty feet beneath: six hours after, it rose near forty feet, almost reached the floor of the bridge, and flowed upward with great rapidity. The channel in this place being narrow in proportion to the Severn, and confined between perpendicular cliffs, the great rise and fall of the river are peculiarly manifest.â, light, trembling, high, Strides like a spider o'er the Wye; When, for the joys the morn had giv'n, Our thankful hearts were raised to Heav'n? Never:âthat moment shall be dear, While hills can charm, or sun-beams cheer. Pollett, farewell! Thy dashing oar Shall lull us into peace no more; But where Kyrle trimm'd his infant green, Long mayst thou with thy bark be seen; And happy be the hearts that glide Through such a scene, with such a guide. The verse of gravel walks that tells, With pebble-rocks and mole-hill swells, May strain description's bursting cheeks, And far outrun the goal it seeks. Not so when ev'ning's purpling hours Hied us away to Persfield's bowers: Here no such danger waits the lay; Sing on, and truth shall lead the way. Here sight may range, and hearts may glow, Yet shrink from the abyss below; Here echoing precipices roar, As youthful ardour shouts before; Here a sweet paradise shall rise At once to greet poetic eyes. Then why does HE dispel, unkind, The sweet illusion from the mind, YON GIANT An immense giant of stone, who, to say the best of him, occupies a place where such personages are least wanted, or wished., with the goggling eye, Who strides in mock sublimity? Giants identified may frown; Nature and taste would knock them down: Blocks that usurp some noble station, As if to curb imagination, Which, smiling at the chisel's power, Makes better monsters every hour. Beneath impenetrable green, Down, 'midst the hazel stems, was seen The turbid stream, with all that past; The lime-white deck, the gliding mast; Or skiff with gazers darting by, Who raised their hands in ecstasy. Impending cliffs hung overhead; The rock-path sounded to the tread, Where twisted roots, in many a fold, Through moss, disputed room for hold. The stranger who thus steals one hour To trace thy walks from bower to bower, Thy noble cliffs, thy wildwood joys, Nature's own work that never cloys, Who, while reflection bids him roam, Calls not this paradise his home, Can ne'er, with dull unconscious eye, Leave them behind without a sigh. Thy tale of truth then, Sorrow, tell, Of him who bade this home farewell; Morris of Persfield.âHark, the strains! Hark! 'tis some hoary bard complains! The decds, the worth, he knew so well, The force of nature bids him tell. MORRIS OF PERSFIELD. Who was lord of yon beautiful seat; Yon woods which are tow'ring so high? Who spread the rich board for the great, Yet listen'd to pity's soft sigh? Who gave with a spirit so free, And fed the distress'd at his door? Our Morris of Persfield was he, Who dwelt in the hearts of the poor. But who e'en of wealth shall make sure, Since wealth to misfortune has bow'd? Long cherish'd untainted and pure, The stream of his charity flow d. But all his resources gave way; O what could his feelings control? What shall curb, in the prosperous day, Th' excess of a generous soul? He bade an adieu to the town; O, can I forget the sad day? When I saw the poor widows kneel down To bless him, to weep, and to pray. Though sorrow was mark'd in his eye, This trial he manfully bore; Then pass'd o'er the bridge of the Wye, To return to his Persfield no more. 'Twas true that another might feel; That poverty still might be fed; Yet long we rung out the dumb peal, For to us noble Morris was dead. He had not lost sight of his home, Yon domain that so lovely appears, When he heard it, and sunk overcome; He felt itâand burst into tears. The lessons of prudence have charms, And slighted, may lead to distress; But the man whom benevolence warms Is an angel who lives but to bless. If ever man merited fame, If ever man's failings went free, Forgot at the sound of his name, Our Morris of Persfield was he The author is equally indebted to Mr. Coxe's County History for this anecdote, as for the greater part of the notes subjoined throughout the Journal.. Cleft from the summit, who shall say When Wind-Cliff's other half gave way? Or when the sea-waves, roaring strong, First drove the rock-bound tide along? To studious leisure be resign'd, The task that leads the wilder'd mind, From time's first birth throughout the range Of nature's everlasting change. Soon from his all-commanding brow, Lay Persfield's rocks and woods below. Back over Monmouth who could trace The Wye's fantastic mountain race? Before us, sweeping far and wide, Lay out-stretch'd Severn's ocean tide, Through whose blue mists, all upward blown, Broke the faint lines of heights unknown; And still, (though clouds would interpose,) The Cotswold promontories rose In dark succession: Stinchcombe's brow, With Berkeley-Castle crouch'd below; And stranger spires on either hand, From Thornbury, on the Glo'ster strand, With black-brow'd woods, and yellow fields, (The boundless wealth that summer yields,) Detain'd the eye, that glanced again O'er Kingroad anchorage to the main. Or was the bounded view preferr'd, Far, far beneath, the spreading herd Low'd, as the cow-boy stroll'd along, And cheerly sung his last new song. But cow-boy, herd, and tide, and spire Sunk into gloom.âThe tinge of fire, As westward roll'd the setting day, Fled like a golden dream away. Then Chepstow's ruin'd fortress caught The mind's collected store of thought; A dark, majestic, jealous frown Hung on his brow, and warn'd us down. 'Twas well; for he has much to boast, Much still that tells of glories lost, Though rolling years have form'd the sod, Where once the bright-helm'd warrior trod From tower to tower, and gazed around, While all beneath him slept profound. E'en on the walls where paced the brave, High o'er his crumbling turrets wave The rampant seedlings.âNot a breath Pass'd through their leaves; when, still as death, We stopp'd to watch the cloudsâfor night Grew splendid with increasing light, Till, as time loudly told the hour, Gleam'd the broad-front of Marten's Tower Henry Marten, whose signature appears upon the death-warrant of Charles the First, finished his days here in prison. Marten lived to the advanced age of seventy-eight, and died by a stroke of apoplexy, which seized him while he was at dinner, in the twentieth year of his confinement. He was buried in the chancel of the parish church at Chepstow. Over his ashes was placed a stone with an inscription, which remained there until one of the succeeding vicars declaring his abhorrence that the monument of a rebel should stand so near the altar, removed the stone into the body of the church!, Bright silver'd by the moon.âThen rose The wild notes sacred to repose; Then the lone owl awoke from rest, Stretch'd his keen talons, plumed his crest, And, from his high embattled station, Hooted a trembling salutation. Rocks caught the âhallooâ from his tongue, And Persfield back the echoes flung Triumphant o'er th'illustrious dead, Their history lost, their glories fled. BOOK III.

Peace to your white-wall'd cots, ye vales, Untainted fly your summer gales: Health, thou from cities lov'st to roam, O make the Monmouth hills thy home! Great spirits of her bards of yore, While harvests triumph, torrents roar, Train her young shepherds, train them high To sing of mountain liberty: Give them the harp and modest maid; Give them the sacred village shade. Long be Llandenny, and Llansoy, Names that import a rural joy; Known to our fathers, when May-day Brush'd a whole twelvemonth's care away. Far diff'rent joys possess'd the mind, When Chepstow fading sunk behind, And, from a belt of woods full grown, Arose immense thy turrets brown, Majestic Ragland! Harvests wave Where thund'ring hosts their watch-word gave, When cavaliers, with downcast eye, Struck the last flag of loyalty This castle, with a garrison commanded by the Marquis of Worcester, was the last place of strength which held out for the unfortunate Charles the First.: Then, left by gallant Worc'ster's band, To devastation's cruel hand The beauteous fabric bow'd, fled all The splendid hours of festival. No smoke ascends; the busy hum Is heard no more; no rolling drum, No high-toned clarion sounds alarms, No banner wakes the pride of arms âThese magnificent ruins, including the citadel, occupy a tract of ground not less than one-third of a mile in circumference. âIn addition to the injury the castle sustained from the parliamentary army, considerable dilapidations have been occasioned by the numerous tenants in the vicinity, who conveyed away the stone and other materials for the construction of farm-houses, barns, and other buildings. No less than twenty-three staircases were taken down by these devastators; but the present Duke of Beaufort no sooner succeeded to his estate than he instantly gave orders that not a stone should be moved from its situation, and thus preserved these noble ruins from destruction.â History of Monmouthshire, page 148.; But ivy, creeping year by year, Of growth enormous, triumphs here. Each dark festoon with pride upheaves Its glossy wilderness of leaves On sturdy limbs, that, clasping, bow Broad o'er the turrets' utmost brow, Encompassing, by strength alone, In fret-work bars, the sliding stone, That tells how years and storms prevail, And spreads its dust upon the gale. The man who could unmoved survey What ruin, piecemeal, sweeps away; Works of the pow'rful and the brave, All sleeping in the silent grave; Unmoved reflect, that here were sung Carols of joy, by beauty's tongue, Is fit, where'er he deigns to roam, And hardly fitâto stay at home. Spent here in peace,âone solemn hour ('Midst legends of the Yellow Tower, Truth and tradition's mingled stream, Fear's start, and superstition's dream A village woman, who very officiously pointed out all that she knew respecting the former state of the castle, desired us to remark the descent to a vault, apparently of large dimensions, in which she had heard that no candle would continue burning; âand,â added she, âthey say it is because of the damps; but for my part, I think the devil is there.â) Is pregnant with a thousand joys, That distance, place, nor time destroys; That with exhaustless stores supply Food for reflection till we die. Onward the rested steeds pursued The cheerful route, with strength renew'd, For onward lay the gallant town, Whose name old custom hath clipp'd down, With more of music left than many, So handily to Aberganny. And as the sidelong, sober light Left valleys darken'd, hills less bright, Great Blorenge rose to tell his tale; And the dun peak of Pen-y-Vale Stood like a sentinel, whose brow Scowl'd on the sleeping world below; Yet even sleep itself outspread The mountain paths we meant to tread, 'Midst fresh'ning gales all unconfined, Where Usk's broad valley shrinks behind. Joyous the crimson morning rose, As joyous from the night's repose Sprung the light heart. The glancing eye Beheld, amidst the dappled sky, Exulting Pen-y-Vale. But how Could females climb his gleaming brow, Rude toil encount'ring? how defy The wint'ry torrent's course, when dry, A rough-scoop'd bed of stones? or meet The powerful force of August heat? Wheels might assist, could wheels be found Adapted to the rugged ground: 'Twas done; for prudence bade us start With three Welsh ponies, and a cart; A red-cheek'd mountaineer The driver, Powell, I believe, occupied a cottage, or small farm, which we passed during the ascent, and where goats' milk was offered for refreshment., a wit, Full of rough shafts, that sometimes hit, Trudged by their side, and twirl'd his thong, And cheer'd his scrambling team along. At ease to mark a scene so fair, And treat their steeds with mountain air, Some rode apart, or led before, Rock after rock the wheels upbore; The careful driver slowly sped, To many a bough we duck'd the head, And heard the wild inviting calls Of summer's tinkling waterfalls, In wooded glens below; and still, At every step the sister hill, Blorenge, grew greater; half unseen At times from out our bowers of green, That telescopic landscapes made, From the arch'd windows of its shade; For woodland tracts begirt us round; The vale beyond was fairy ground, That verse can never paint. Above Gleam'd, (something like the mount of Jove, But how much, let the learned say, Who take Olympus in their way) Gleam'd the fair, sunny, cloudless peak That simple strangers ever seek. And are they simple? Hang the dunce Who would not doff his cap at once In ecstasy, when, bold and new, Bursts on his sight a mountain-view. Though vast the prospect here became, Intensely as the love of fame Glow'd the strong hope, that strange desire, That deathless wish of climbing higher, Where heather clothes his graceful sides, Which many a scatter'd rock divides, Bleach'd by more years than hist'ry knows, Moved by no power but melting snows, Or gushing springs, that wash away Th' embedded earth that forms their stay. The heart distends, the whole frame feels, Where, inaccessible to wheels, The utmost storm-worn summit spreads Its rocks grotesque, its downy beds; Here no false feeling, sense belies, Man lifts the weary foot, and sighs; Laughter is dumb; hilarity Forsakes at once th' astonish'd eye; E'en the closed lip, half useless grown, Drops but a word, âLook down; look down.â Good Heav'ns! must scenes like these expand, Scenes so magnificently grand, And millions breathe, and pass away, Unbless'd throughout their little day, With one short glimpse? By place confined, Shall many an anxious, ardent mind, Sworn to the Muses, cower its pride, Doom'd but to sing with pinions tied? Spirit of Burns! the daring child Of glorious freedom, rough and wild, How have I wept o'er all thy ills, How blest thy Caledonian hills! How almost worshipp'd in my dreams Thy mountain haunts,âthy classic streams! How burnt with hopeless, aimless fire, To mark thy giant strength aspire In patriot themes! and tuned the while Thy âBonny Doonâ or âBalloch Mile.â Spirit of Burns! accept the tear That rapture gives thy mem'ry here On the bleak mountain top. Here thou Thyself hadst raised the gallant brow Of conscious intellect, to twine Th' imperishable verse of thine, That charms the world. Or can it be, That scenes like these were nought to thee? That Scottish hills so far excel, That so deep sinks the Scottish dell, That boasted Pen-y-Vale had been The respective heights of these mountains above the mouth of the Gavany were taken barometrically by Gen. Roy. The summit of the Sugar-Loaf. . . . 1852 Feet. Of the Blorenge. . . . . . . . . 1720 Feet. Of the Skyrid . . . . . . . . . 1498 Feet. For thy loud northern lyre too mean; Broad-shoulder'd Blorenge a mere knoll, And Skyrid, let him smile or scowl, A dwarfish bully, vainly proud, Because he breaks the passing cloud? If even so, thou bard of fame, The consequences rest the same: For, grant that to thy infant sight Rose mountains of stupendous height; Or grant that Cambrian minstrels taught 'Mid scenes that mock the lowland thought; Grant that old Talliesen flung His thousand raptures, as he sung From huge Plynlimon's awful brow, Or Cader Idris, capt with snow; Such Alpine scenes with them or thee Well suited.âThese are Alps to me. Long did we, noble Blorenge, gaze On thee, and mark the eddying haze That strove to reach thy level crown, From the rich stream, and smoking town; And oft, old Skyrid, hail'd thy name, Nor dared deride thy holy fame There still remains, on the summit of the Skyrid, or St. Michael's Mount, the foundation of an ancient chapel, to which the inhabitants formerly ascended on Michaelmas Eve, in a kind of pilgrimage. A prodigious cleft, or separation in the hill, tradition says, was caused by the earthquake at the crucifixion; it was therefore termed the Holy Mountain.. Long follow'd with untiring eye Th' illumined clouds, that o'er the sky Drew their thin veil, and slowly sped, Dipping to every mountain's head, Dark mingling, fading, wild, and thence, Till admiration, in suspense, Hung on the verge of sight. Then sprung, By thousands known, by thousands sung, Feelings that earth and time defy, That cleave to immortality. A light gray haze inclosed us round: Some momentary drops were found, Borne on the breeze; soon all dispell'd; Once more the glorious prospect swell'd Interminably fair This hill commands a view of the counties of Radnor, Salop, Brecknock, Glamorgan, Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, Somerset, and Wilts.. Again Stretch'd the Black Mountain's dreary chain! When eastward turn'd the straining eye, Great Malvern met the cloudless sky: Dark in the south uprose the shores, Where Ocean in his fury roars, And rolls abrupt his fearful tides, Far still from Mendip's fern-clad sides; From whose vast range of mingling blue The weary, wand'ring sight withdrew, O'er fair Glamorgan's woods and downs, O'er glitt'ring streams, and farms, and towns, Back to the Table Rock, that lowers O'er old Crickhowel's ruin'd towers. Here perfect stillness reign'd. The breath A moment hush'd, 'twas mimic death. The ear, from all assaults released, As motion, sound, and life, had ceased. The beetle rarely murmur'd by, No sheep-dog sent his voice so high, Save when, by chance, far down the steep, Crept a live speck, a straggling sheep; Yet one lone object, plainly seen, Curved slowly, in a line of green, On the brown heath: no demon fell, No wizard foe, with magic spell, To chain the senses, chill the heart, No wizard guided Powel's cart; He of our nectar had the care, All our ambrosia rested there. At leisure, but reluctant still, We join'd him by a mountain rill; And there, on springing turf, all seated, Jove's guests were never half so treated; Journeys they had, and feastings many, But never came to Abergany; Lucky escape:âthe wrangling crew, Mischief to cherish or to brew, Was all their sport; and when, in rage, They chose 'midst warriors to engage, Loud for their fiery steeds they cried, And dash'd th' opposing clouds aside, Whirl'd through the air, and foremost stood 'Midst mortal passions, mortal blood! Beneath us frown'd no deadly war, And Powel's wheels were safer far; As on them, without flame or shield, Or bow to twang, or lance to wield, We left the heights of inspiration, And relish'd a mere mortal station; Our object, not to fire a town, Or aid a chief, or knock him down; But safe to sleep, from war and sorrow, And drive to Brecknock on the morrow. Heavy and low'ring, crowds on crowds, Drove adverse hosts of dark'ning clouds Low o'er the vale, and far away, Deep gloom o'erspread the rising day; No morning beauties caught the eye, O'er mountain top, or stream, or sky, As round the castle's ruin'd tower We mused for many a solemn hour; And, half-dejected, half in spleen, Computed idly, o'er the scene, How many murders there had dy'd Chiefs and their minions, slaves of pride; When perjury, in every breath, Pluck'd the huge falchion from its sheath, And prompted deeds of ghastly fame, That hist'ry's self might blush to name In Jones's History of Brecknockshire, the castle of Abergavenny is noticed as having been the scene of the most shocking enormities.. At length, through each retreating shower, Burst, with a renovating power, Light, life, and gladness; instant fled All contemplations on the dead. Who hath not mark'd, with inward joy, The efforts of the diving boy; And, waiting while he disappear'd, Exulted, trembled, hoped, and fear'd? Then felt his heart, 'midst cheering cries, Bound with delight to see him rise? Who hath not burnt with rage, to see Falsehood's vile cant, and supple knee; Then hail'd, on some courageous brow, The power that works her overthrow; That, swift as lightning, seals her doom, âHence, miscreant! vanish!âtruth is come?â So Pen-y-Vale upheaved his brow, And left the world of fog below; So Skyrid, smiling, broke his way To glories of the conqu'ring day; With matchless grace, and giant pride, So Blorenge turn'd the clouds aside, And warn'd us, not a whit too soon, To chase the flying car of noon, Where herds and flocks unnumber'd fed, Where Usk her wand'ring mazes led. Here on the mind, with powerful sway, Press'd the bright joys of yesterday; For still, though doom'd no more t'inhale The mountain air of Pen-y-Vale, His broad dark-skirting woods o'erhung Cottage and farm, where careless sung The labourer, where the gazing steer Low'd to the mountains, deep and clear. Slow less'ning Blorenge, left behind, Reluctantly his claims resign'd, And stretch'd his glowing front entire, As forward peep'd Crickhowel spire; But no proud castle's turrets gleam'd; No warrior Earl's gay banner stream'd. E'en of thy palace, (grief to tell!) A towerâwithout a dinner bell; An archâwhere jav'lin'd sentries bow'd Low to their chief, or fed the crowd, Are all that mark where once a train Of Barons graced thy rich domain, Illustrious Pembroke Part of the original palace of the powerful Earls of Pembroke is still undemolished by time.! drain'd thy bowl, And caught the nobleness of soulâ The harp-inspired, indignant blood That prompts to arms and hardihood. To muse upon the days gone by, Where desolation meets the eye, Is double life: truth, cheaply bought, The nurse of sense, the food of thought, Whence judgment, ripen'd, forms, at will, Her estimates of good or ill; And brings contrasted scenes to view, And weighs the old rogues with the new; Imperious tyrants, gone to dust, With tyrants whom the world hath cursed Through modern ages.âBy what power Rose the strong walls of old Tre Tower Deep in the valley; whose clear rill Then stole through wilds, and wanders still Through village shades, unstain'd with gore Where war-steeds bathe their hoofs no more. Empires have fallen, armies bled, Since yon old wall, with upright head, Met the loud tempest; who can trace When first the rude mass, from its base, Stoop'd in that dreadful form? E'en thou, Jane, with the placid silver brow, Know'st not the day, though thou hast seen A hundred Jane Edwards, or as she pronounced it, Etwarts, a tall, bony, upright woman, leaning both hands on the head of her stick, and in her manners venerably impressive, was then at the age of one hundred. She was living in 1809, then one hundred and two. springs of cheerful green, A hundred winters' snows increase That brook,âthe emblem of thy peace. Most venerable dame! and shall The plund'rer, in his gorgeous hall, His fame with Moloch-frown prefer, And scorn thy harmless character, Who scarcely hear'st of his renown, And never sack'd or burnt a town? But should he crave, with coward cries, To be Jane Edwards when he dies, Thou'lt be the Conqueror, old lass, So take thy alms, and let us pass. Forth, from the calm sequester'd shade, Once more approaching twilight, bade; When, as the sigh of joy arose, And while e'en fancy sought repose, One vast transcendant object sprung, Arresting every eye and tongue. Strangers, (fair Brecon,) wondering, scan The peaks of thy stupendous Vann: But how can strangers, chain'd by time, Through floating clouds his summit climb? Another day had almost fled; A clear horizon, glowing red, Its promise on all hearts impress'd, Bright sunny hours, and Sabbath rest. BOOK IV. The Gaer, a Roman StationâBrunless CastleâThe HayâFuneral Song, âMary's GraveââClifford CastleâReturn by Hereford, Malvern Hills, Cheltenham, and Gloucester, to UleyâConclusion. 'Tis sweet to hear the soothing chime, And, by thanksgiving, measure time, When hard-wrought poverty awhile Upheaves the bending back to smile; When servants hail, with boundless glee, The sweets of love and liberty. Seldom has worship cheer'd my soul With such invincible control! It was a bright benignant hour, The song of praise was full of power; And, darting from the noon-day sky, Amidst the tide of harmony, O'er aisle and pillar glancing strong, Heav'n's radiant light inspired the song. The word of peace, that can disarm Care with its own peculiar charm, Here flow'd a double stream, to cheer The Saxon Divine service is performed alternately in English and Welsh. That they still call us Saxons need hardly be mentioned. The army, it appears, is quite as accommodating as the church, for the posting bills for recruits are printed in both languages. and the Mountaineer, Of various stock, of various name, Now join'd in rights, and join'd in fame. Ye who religion's duty teach, What constitutes a Sabbath breach? Is it, when joy the bosom fills, To wander o'er the breezy hills? Is it, to trace around your home The footsteps of imperial Rome? Then guilty, guilty let us plead, Who, on the cheerful rested steed, In thought absorb'd, explored, with care, The wild lanes round the silent Gaer A road must have led from Abergavenny, through the Vale of the Usk, north-west to the âGaer,â situated two miles north-west of Brecon, on a gentle eminence, at the conflux of the rivers Esker and Usk. Mr. Wyndham traced parts of walls, which he describes as exactly resembling those at Caerleon; and Mr. Lemon found several bricks, bearing the inscription of LEG. II. AVG.âCoxe. In addition to the above, it may be acceptable to state, that Mr. Price, a very intelligent farmer on the spot, has in his possession several of the above kind of bricks, bearing the same inscription, done, evidently, by stamping the clay, while moist, with an instrument. These have been turned up by the plough, together with several small Roman lamps., Where conqu'ring eagles took their stand; Where heathen altars stain'd the land; Where soldiers of Augustus pined, Perhaps, for pleasures left behind, And measured, from this lone abode, The new-form'd, stony, forest road, Back to Caerleon's southern train, Their barks, their home, beyond the main: Still by the Vann reminded strong Of Alpine scenes, and mountain song, The olive groves, the cloudless sky, And golden vales of Italy. With us 'twas peace, we met no foes; With us far diff'rent feelings rose. Still onward inclination bade: The wilds of Mona's Druid shade, Snowdon's sublime and stormy brow, His land of Britons stretch'd below, And Penman Mawr's huge crags, that greet The thund'ring ocean at his feet, Were all before us. Hard it proved To quit a land so dearly loved; Forego each bold terrific boast Of northern Cambria's giant coast. Friends of the harp and song, forgive The deep regret that, whilst I live, Shall dwell upon my heart and tongue: Go, joys untasted! themes unsung! Another scene, another land, Hence shall the homeward verse demand. Yet fancy wove her flow'ry chain, Till âfarcwell Brecon' left a pain, A pain that travellers may endure; Change is their food, and change their cure. Yet, oh, how dream-like, far away, To recollect so bright a day! Dream-like those scenes the townsmen love, Their tumbling Usk, their Priory Grove, View'd while the moon cheer'd, calmly bright, The freshness of a summer's night. High o'er the town, in morning smiles, The blue Vann heaved his deep defiles; And ranged, like champions for the fight, Basking in sun-beams on our right, Rose the Black Mountains, that surround That far-famed spot of holy ground, Llanthony, dear to monkish tale, And still the pride of Ewais Vale. No road-side cottage smoke was seen, Or rarely, on the village green: No youths appear'd, in spring-tide dress, In ardent play, or idleness. Brown waved the harvest, dale and slope Exulting bore a nation's hope; Sheaves rose as far as sight could range, And every mile was but a change Of peasants lab'ring, lab'ring still, And climbing many a distant hill. Some talk'd, perhaps, of spring's bright hour, And how they piled, in Brunless Tower The only remaining tower of Brunless Castle now makes an excellent hay-loft; and almost every building on the spot is composed of fragments., The full-dried hay. Perhaps they told Tradition's tales, and taught how old The ruin'd castle? False or true, They guess'd itâjust as others do. Lone tower! though suffer'd yet to stand, Dilapidation's wasting hand Shall tear thy pond'rous walls, to guard The slumb'ring steed, or fence the yard; Or wheels shall grind thy pride away Along the turnpike road to Hay, Where fierce Glendow'r's rude mountaineers Left war's attendants, blood and tears, And spread their terrors many a mile, And shouted round the flaming pile. May Heav'n preserve our native land From blind ambition's murdering hand; From all the wrongs that can provoke A people's wrath, and urge the stroke That shakes the proudest throne! Guard, Heav'n, The sacred birth-right thou hast given; Bid justice curb, with strong control, The desp'rate passions of the soul. Here ivy'd fragments, lowering, throw Broad shadows on the poor below, Who, while they rest, and when they die, Sleep on the rock-built shores of Wye. To tread o'er nameless mounds of earth, To muse upon departed worth, To credit still the poor distress'd, For feelings never half express'd, Their hopes, their faith, their tender love, Faith that sustain'd, and hope that strove, Is sacred joy; to heave a sigh, A debt to poor mortality. Funereal rites are closed; 'tis done; Ceased is the bell; the priest is gone; What then if bust or stone denies To catch the pensive loit'rer's eyes, What course can poverty pursue? What can the poor pretend to do? O boast not, quarries, of your store; Boast not, O man, of wealth or lore: The flowers of nature here shall thrive, Affection keep those flowers alive; And they shall strike the melting heart, Beyond the utmost power of art; Planted on graves To the custom of scattering flowers over the graves of departed friends, David ap Gwillym beautifully alludes in one of his odes. âO, whilst thy season of flowers, and thy tender sprays thick of leaves remain, I will pluck the roses from the brakes, the flowerets of the meads, and gems of the wood; the vivid trefoil, beauties of the ground, and the gaily-smiling bloom of the verdant herbs, to be offered to the memory of a chief of fairest fame. Humbly will I lay them on the grave of Ivor.â On a grave in the churchyard at Hay, or The Hay, as it is commonly spoken, flowers had evidently been planted, but only one solitary sprig of sweet-briar had taken root., their stems entwine, And every blossom is a line Indelibly impress'd, that tends, In more than language comprehends, To teach us, in our solemn hours, That we ourselves are dying flowers. What if a father buried here His earthly hope, his friend most dear, His only child? Shall his dim eye, At poverty's command, be dry? No, he shall muse, and think, and pray, And weep his tedious hours away; Or weave the song of woe to tell How dear that child he loved so well. MARY'S GRAVE. No child have I left, I must wander alone, No light-hearted Mary to sing as I go, Nor loiter to gather bright flowers newly blown; She delighted, sweet maid, in these emblems of woe. Then the stream glided by her, or playfully boil'd O'er its rock-bed unceasing, and still it flows free; But her infant life was arrested, unsoil'd As the dew-drop, when shook by the wing of the bee. Sweet flowers were her treasures, and flowers shall be mine; I bring them from Radnor's green hills to her grave: Thus planted in anguish, oh let them entwine O'er a heart once as gentle as Heav'n e'er gave. Oh, the glance of her eye, when at mansions of wealth I pointed, suspicious, and warn'd her of harm; She smiled in content, 'midst the bloom of her health, And closer and closer still hung on my arm. What boots it to tell of the sense she possess'd, The fair buds of promise that mem'ry endears? The mild dove, affection, was queen of her breast, And I had her love, and her truth, and her tears; She was mine. But she goes to the land of the good, A change which I must, and yet dare, not deplore: I'll bear the rude shock like the oak of the wood, But the green hills of Radnor will charm me no more. Ruins of greatness, all farewell; No Chepstows here, no Raglands tell, By mound, or foss, or mighty tower, Achievements high in hall or bower; Or give to fancy's vivid eye The helms and plumes of chivalry. Clifford has fall'n, howe'er sublime, Mere fragments wrestle still with time; Yet as they perish, sure and slow, And rolling dash the stream below, They raise tradition's glowing scene, The clue of silk, the wrathful queen, And link, in mem'ry's firmest bond, The love-lorn tale of Rosamond Clifford Castle is supposed to have been the birth-place of Fair Rosamond.. How placid, how divinely sweet, The flow'r-grown brook that, by our feet, Winds a on summer's day; e'en where Its name no classic honours share, Its springs untraced, its course unknown, Seaward, for ever rambling down! Here, then, how sweet, pellucid, chaste; 'Twas this bright current bade us taste The fulness of its joy. Glide still, Enchantress of Plynlimon Hill, Meandering Wye! Still let me dream, In raptures, o'er thy infant stream; For could th'immortal soul forego Its cumbrous load of earthly woe, And clothe itself in fairy guise, Too small, too pure, for human eyes, Blithe would we seek thy utmost spring, Where mountain-larks first try the wing; There, at the crimson dawn of day, Launch a scoop'd leaf, and sail away, Stretch'd at our ease, or crouch below, Or climb the green transparent prow, Stooping where oft the blue-bell sips The passing stream, and shakes and dips; And when the heifer came to drink, Quick from the gale our bark would shrink, And huddle down amidst the brawl Of many a five-inch waterfall, Till the expanse should fairly give The bow'ring hazel room to live; And as each swelling junction came, To form a riv'let worth a name, We'd dart beneath, or brush away Long-beaded webs, that else might stay Our silent course; in haste retreat, Where whirlpools near the bull-rush meet; Wheel round the ox of monstrous size; And count below his shadowy flies; And sport amidst the throng; and when We met the barks of giant men, Avoid their oars, still undescried, And mock their overbearing pride; Then vanish by some magic spell, And shout, âDelicious Wye, farewell!â 'Twas noon, when o'er thy mountain stream, The carriage roll'd, each pow'rful gleam Struck on thy surface, where, below, Spread the deep heaven's azure glow; And water-flowers, a mingling crowd, Waved in the dazzling silver cloud. Again farewell! The treat is o'er! For me shall Cambria smile no more; Yet truth shall still the song sustain, And touch the springs of joy again. Hail! land of cyder, vales of health! Redundant fruitage, rural wealth; Here, did Pomona still retain Her influence o'er a British plain, Might temples rise, spring blossoms fly Round the capricious deity; Or autumn sacrifices bound, By myriads, o'er the hallow'd ground, And deep libations still renew The fervours of her dancing crew. Land of delight! let mem'ry strive To keep thy flying scenes alive; Thy grey-limb'd orchards, scattering wide Their treasures by the highway side; Thy half-hid cottages, that show The dark green moss, the resting bough, At broken panes, that taps and flies, Illumes and shades the maiden's eyes At day-break, and, with whisper'd joy, Wakes the light-hearted shepherd boy: These, with thy noble woods and dells, The hazel copse, the village bells, Charm'd more the passing sultry hours Than Hereford, with all her towers. Sweet was the rest, with welcome cheer, But a far nobler scene was near; And when the morrow's noon had spread, O'er orchard stores, the deep'ning red, Behind us rose the billowy cloud, That dims the air to city crowd. And deem not that, where cyder reigns The beverage of a thousand plains, Malt, and the liberal harvest horn, Are all unknown, or laugh'd to scorn; A spot that all delights might bring, A palace for an eastern king, Canfrome The noble seat of Richard Cope Hopton, Esq. which exhibits, in a striking manner, the real old English magnificence and hospitality of the last age., shall from her vaults display John Barleycorn's resistless sway. To make the odds of fortune even, Up bounced the cork of âseventy-seven,â And sent me back to school; for then, Ere yet I learn'd to wield the pen; (The pen that should all crimes assail, The pen that leads to fameâor jail;) Then steam'd the malt, whose spirit bears The frosts and suns of thirty years! Through Ledbury, at decline of day, The wheels that bore us roll'd away To cross the Malvern Hills. 'Twas night; Alternate met the weary sight Each steep, dark, undulating brow, And Worc'ster's gloomy vale below. Gloomy no more, when eastward sprung The light that gladdens heart and tongue; When morn glanced o'er the shepherd's bed, And cast her tints of lovely red Wide o'er the vast expanding scene, And mix'd her hues with mountain green; Then, gazing from a height so fair, Through miles of unpolluted air, Where cultivation triumphs wide, O'er boundless views on every side, Thick planted towns, where toils ne'er cease, And far spread silent village peace; As each succeeding pleasure came, The heart acknowledged Malvern's fame. Oft glancing thence to Cambria still, Thou yet wert seen, my fav'rite hill, Delightful Pen-y-Vale! Nor shall Great Malvern's high imperious call Wean me from thee, or turn aside My earliest charm, my heart's strong pride. Boast, Malvern, that thy springs revive The drooping patient, scarce alive; Where, as he gathers strength to toil, Not e'en thy heights his spirit foil, But nerve him on to bless, t'inhale, And triumph in the morning gale; Or noon's transcendent glories give The vigorous touch that bids him live. Perhaps e'en now he stops to breathe, Surveying the expanse beneath; Now climbs again, where keen winds blow, And holds his beaver to his brow; Waves to the Wrecken his pale hand, And, borrowing Fancy's magic wand, Skims over Worc'ster's spires away, Where sprung the blush of rising day; And eyes with joy sweet Hagley Groves, That taste reveres and virtue loves; And stretch'd upon thy utmost ridge, Marks Severn's course, and Upton-bridge, That leads to home, to friends, or wife, And all thy sweets, domestic life: While starts the tear, his bosom glows, That consecrated Avon flows Down the blue distant vale, to yield Its stores by Tewkesbury's deadly field, And feels whatever can inspire, From history's page or poet's fire. Bright vale of Severn! shall the song That wildly devious roves along, The charms of nature to explore, On history rest, or themes of yore? More joy the thoughts of home supply; Short be the glance at days gone by, Though gallant Tewkesbury, clean and gay, Hath much to tempt the traveller's stayâ Her noble abbey, with its dead, A powerful claim: a silent dread, Sacred as holy virtue, springs Where rests the dust of chiefs and kings; With his who by foul murder died, The fierce Lancastrian's hope and pride, (When brothers brothers could destroy) Heroic Margaret's red-rose boy Frince Edward, son of Henry the Sixth, taken prisoner with his mother, Margaret of Anjou, at the battle of Tewkesbury, and murdered by the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard the Third.. Muse, turn thee from the field of blood, Rest to the brave, peace to the good: Avon, with all thy charms, adieu! For Cheltenham mocks thy pilgrim crew; And like a girl in beauty's power, Flirts in the fairings of an hour. Queen of the valley! soon behind Gleam'd thy bright fanes, in sun and wind, Fair Glo'ster. Though thy fabric stands, The boast of Severn's winding sands, If grandeur, beauty, grace, can stay The traveller on his homeward way. There rests the Norman prince who rose In zeal against the christians' foes, Yet doom'd at home to pine and die, Of birthright robb'd, and liberty; His tide of wrongs he could not stem, His brothers filch'd his diadem The eldest son of William the Conqueror was imprisoned eight-and-twenty years by his own brother!. There sleeps the king who aim'd to spurn The daring Scots, at Bannockburn; But turn'd him back, with humbled fame, And Berkley's âshrieks âShrieks of an agonizing king.ââ declare his name. Cease, cease the layâthe goal is wonâ Yet memory still shall revel on. Fast closed the day, the last bright hour, The setting sun, on Dursley tower, Welcomed us home, and forward bade, To Uley valley's peaceful shade. Who so unfeeling, who so bold, To judge that fictions, idly told, Deform my verse, that only tries To consecrate realities? If e'er th' unworthy thought should come, Let strong conviction strike them dumb. Go to the proof; your steed prepare, Drink nature's cup, the rapture share; If dull you find your devious course, Your tour is uselessâsell your horse. Ye who, ingulf'd in trade, endure What gold alone can never cure; The constant sigh for scenes of peace, From the world's trammels free release, Wait not, (for reason's sake attend,) Wait not in chains till times shall mend; Till the clear voice, grown hoarse and gruff, Cries, âNow I'll go, I'm rich enough.â Youth, and the prime of manhood, seize; Steal ten days absence, ten days ease; Bid ledgers from your minds depart; Let mem'ry's treasures cheer the heart; And when your children round you grow, With opening charms and manly brow, Talk of the Wye as some old dream, Call it the wild, the wizard stream; Sink in your broad arm-chair to rest, And youth shall smile to see you bless'd. Artists, betimes your powers employ, And take the pilgrimage of joy; The eye of genius may behold A thousand beauties here untold; Rock, that defies the winter's storm; Wood, in its most imposing form, That climbs the mountain, bows below, Where deep th' unsullied waters flow. Here Gilpin's eye, transported, scann'd Views by no tricks of fancy plann'd; Gray here, upon the stream reclined, Stored with delight his ardent mind. But let the vacant trifler stray From thy enchantments far away; For should, from fashion's rainbow train, The idle and the vicious vain In sacrilege presume to move Through these dear scenes of peace and love, The spirit of the stream would rise In wrathful mood and tenfold size, And nobly guard his Coldwell Spring, And bid his inmost caverns ring; Loud thund'ring on the giddy crew, âMy stream was never meant for you.â But ye, to nobler feelings born, Who sense and nature dare not scorn, Glide gaily on, and ye shall find The blest serenity of mind That springs from silence; or shall raise The hand, the eye, the voice of praise. Live then, sweet stream! and henceforth be The darling of posterity; Loved for thyself, for ever dear, Like beauty's smile and virtue's tear, Till Time his striding race give o'er, And verse itself shall charm no more. MAY-DAY WITH THE MUSES. THE INVITATION. O for the strength to paint my joy once more! That joy I feel when Winter's reign is o'er; When the dark despot lifts his hoary brow, And seeks his polar-realm's eternal snow. Though black November's fogs oppress my brain, Shake every nerve, and struggling fancy chain; Though time creeps o'er me with his palsied hand, And frost-like bids the stream of passion stand, And through his dry teeth sends a shivering blast, And points to more than fifty winters past, Why should I droop with heartless, aimless eye? Friends start around, and all my phantoms fly, And Hope, upsoaring with expanded wing, Unfolds a scroll, inscribed âRemember Spring.â Stay, sweet enchantress, charmer of my days, And glance thy rainbow colours o'er my lays; Be to poor Giles what thou hast ever been, His heart's warm solace and his sovereign queen; Dance with his rustics when the laugh runs high, Live in the lover's heart, the maiden's eye; Still be propitious when his feet shall stray Beneath the bursting hawthorn-buds of May; Warm every thought, and brighten every hour, And let him feel thy presence and thy power. Sir Ambrose Higham, in his eightieth year, With memory unimpair'd, and conscience clear, His English heart untrammell'd, and full blown His senatorial honours and renown, Now, basking in his plenitude of fame, Resolved, in concert with his noble dame, To drive to town no moreâno more by night To meet in crowded courts a blaze of light, In streets a roaring mob with flags unfurl'd, And all the senseless discord of the world,â But calmly wait the hour of his decay, The broad bright sunset of his glorious day; And where he first drew breath at last to fall, Beneath the towering shades of Oakly Hall The seat of Sir Ambrose is situated in the author's imagination only; the reader must build Oakly Hall where he pleases.. Quick spread the news through hamlet, field, and farm, The labourer wiped his brow and staid his arm; 'Twas news to him of more importance far Than change of empires or the yells of war; It breathed a hope which nothing could destroy, Poor widows rose, and clapp'd their hands for joy, Glad voices rang at every cottage door, âGood old Sir Ambrose goes to town no more.â Well might the village bells the triumphs sound, Well might the voice of gladness ring around; Where sickness raged, or want allied to shame, Sure as the sun his well-timed succour came; Food for the starving child, and warmth and wine For age that totter'd in its last decline. From him they shared the embers' social glow; He fed the flame that glanced along the snow, When winter drove his storms across the sky, And pierced the bones of shrinking poverty. Sir Ambrose loved the Muses, and would pay Due honours even to the ploughman's lay; Would cheer the feebler bard, and with the strong Soar to the noblest energies of song; Catch the rib-shaking laugh, or from his eye Dash silently the tear of sympathy. Happy old man!âwith feelings such as these The seasons all can charm, and trifles please; And hence a sudden thought, a new-born whim, Would shake his cup of pleasure to the brim, Turn scoffs and doubts and obstacles aside, And instant action follow like a tide. Time past, he had on his paternal ground With pride the latent sparks of genius found In many a local ballad, many a tale, As wild and brief as cowslips in the dale, Though unrecorded as the gleams of light That vanish in the quietness of night. âWhy not,â he cried, as from his couch he rose, âTo cheer my age, and sweeten my repose, âWhy not be just and generous in time, âAnd bid my tenants pay their rents in rhyme? âFor one half year they shall.âA feast shall bring. âA crowd of merry faces in the spring;â âHere, pens, boy, pens; I'll weigh the case no more, âBut write the summons:âgo, go, shut the door. ââAll ye on Oakly manor dwelling, âFarming, labouring, buying, selling, âNeighbours! banish gloomy looks, âMy gray old steward shuts his books. âLet not a thought of winter's rent âDestroy one evening's merriment; âI ask not gold, but tribute found âAbundant on Parnassian ground. âChoose, ye who boast the gift, your themes âOf joy or pathos, tales or dreams, âChoose each a theme;âbut, harkye, bring âNo stupid ghost, no vulgar thing; âFairies, indeed, may wind their way, âAnd sparkle through the brightest lay: âI love their pranks, their favourite green, âAnd, could the little sprites be seen, âWere I a king, I'd sport with them, âAnd dance beneath my diadem. âBut surely fancy need not brood âO'er midnight darkness, crimes, and blood, âIn magic cave or monk's retreat, âWhilst the bright world is at her feet; âWhilst to her boundless range is given, âBy night, by day, the lights of heaven, âAnd all they shine upon; whilst Love âStill reigns the monarch of the grove, âAnd real life before her lies âIn all its thousand, thousand dies. âThen bring me nature, bring me sense, âAnd joy shall be your recompense: âOn Old May-day I hope to see âAll happy:âleave the rest to me. âA general feast shall cheer us all âUpon the lawn that fronts the hall, âWith tents for shelter, laurel boughs, âAnd wreaths of every flower that blows. âThe months are wending fast away; âFarewell,âremember Old May-day.ââ Surprise, and mirth, and gratitude, and jeers, The clown's broad wonder, th' enthusiast's tears, Fresh gleams of comfort on the brow of care, The sectary's cold shrug, the miser's stare, Were all excited, for the tidings flew As quick as scandal the whole country through. âRent paid by rhymes at Oakly may be great, âBut rhymes for taxes would appal the state,â Exclaim'd th' exciseman,ââand then tithes, alas! âWhy there, again, 'twill never come to pass.ââ Thus all still ventured, as the whim inclined, Remarks as various as the varying mind: For here Sir Ambrose sent a challenge forth, That claim'd a tribute due to sterling worth; And all, whatever might their host regale, Agreed to share the feast and drink his ale. Now shot through many a heart a secret fire, A new born spirit, an intense desire For once to catch a spark of local fame, And bear a poet's honourable name! Already some aloft began to soar, And some to think who never thought before; But O, what numbers all their strength applied, Then threw despairingly the task aside With feign'd contempt, and vow'd they'd never tried. Did dairy-wife neglect to turn her cheese, Or idling miller lose the favouring breeze; Did the young ploughman o'er the furrows stand, Or stalking sower swing an empty hand, One common sentence on their heads would fall, 'Twas Oakly banquet had bewitch'd them all. Loud roar'd the winds of March, with whirling snow, One brightening hour an April breeze would blow; Now hail, now hoar-frost bent the flow'ret's head, Now struggling beams their languid influence shed, That scarce a cowering bird yet dared to sing 'Midst the wild changes of our island spring. Yet, shall the Italian goatherd boasting cry, âPoor Albion! when hadst thou so clear a sky!â And deem that nature smiles for him alone, Her renovated beauties all his own? No:âlet our April showers by night descend, Noon's genial warmth with twilight stillness blend; The broad Atlantic pour her pregnant breath, And rouse the vegetable world from death; Our island spring is rapture's self to me, All I have seen, and all I wish to see. Thus came the jovial day, no streaks of red O'er the broad portal of the morn were spread, But one high-sailing mist of dazzling white, A screen of gossamer, a magic light, Doom'd instantly, by simplest shepherd's ken, To reign awhile, and be exhaled at ten. O'er leaves, o'er blossoms, by his power restored, Forth came the conquering sun and look'd abroad; Millions of dew-drops fell, yet millions hung, Like words of transport trembling on the tongue Too strong for utt'rance:âThus the infant boy, With rosebud cheeks, and features tuned to joy, Weeps while he struggles with restraint or pain, But change the scene, and make him laugh again, His heart rekindles, and his cheek appears A thousand times more lovely through his tears. From the first glimpse of day a busy scene Was that high swelling lawn, that destined green, Which shadowless expanded far and wide, The mansion's ornament, the hamlet's pride; To cheer, to order, to direct, contrive, Even old Sir Ambrose had been up at five; There his whole household labour'd in his view,â But light is labour where the task is new. Some wheel'd the turf to build a grassy throne Round a huge thorn that spread his boughs alone, Rough-rind'd and bold, as master of the place; Five generations of the Higham race Had pluck'd his flowers, and still he held his sway, Waved his white head, and felt the breath of May. Some from the green-house ranged exotics round, To bask in open day on English ground: And 'midst them in a line of splendour drew Long wreaths and garlands, gather'd in the dew. Some spread the snowy canvas, propp'd on high O'er shelter'd tables with their whole supply; Some swung the biting scythe with merry face, And cropp'd the daisies for a dancing space. Some roll'd the mouldy barrel in his might, From prison'd darkness into cheerful light, And fenced him round with cans; and others bore The creaking hamper with its costly store, Well cork'd, well flavour'd, and well tax'd, that came From Lusitanian mountains, dear to fame, Whence Gama steer'd, and led the conquering way To eastern triumphs and the realms of day. A thousand minor tasks fill'd every hour, 'Till the sun gain'd the zenith of his power, When every path was throng'd with old and young, And many a sky-lark in his strength upsprung To bid them welcome.âNot a face was there But for May-day at least had banish'd care; No cringing looks, no pauper tales to tell, No timid glance, they knew their host too well,â Freedom was there, and joy in every eye: Such scenes were England's boast in days gone by. Beneath the thorn was good Sir Ambrose found, His guests an ample crescent form'd around; Nature's own carpet spread the space between, Where blithe domestics plied in gold and green. The venerable chaplain waved his wand, And silence follow'd as he stretch'd his hand, And with a trembling voice, and heart sincere, Implored a blessing on th' abundant cheer. Down sat the mingling throng, and shared a feast With hearty welcomes given, by love increased; A patriarch family, a close-link'd band, True to their rural chieftain, heart and hand: The deep carouse can never boast the bliss, The animation of a scene like this. At length the damask cloths were whisk'd away, Like fluttering sails upon a summer's day; The hey-day of enjoyment found repose; The worthy baronet majestic rose; They view'd him, while his ale was filling round, The monarch of his own paternal ground. His cup was full, and where the blossoms bow'd Over his head, Sir Ambrose spoke aloud, Nor stopp'd a dainty form or phrase to cullâ His heart elated, like his cup, was full:â âFull be your hopes, and rich the crops that fall; âHealth to my neighbours, happiness to all.â Dull must that clown be, dull as winter's sleet, Who would not instantly be on his feet: An echoing health to mingling shouts gave place, âSir Ambrose Higham, and his noble race.â Avaunt, Formality! thou bloodless dame, With dripping besom quenching nature's flame; Thou cankerworm, who liv'st but to destroy, And eat the very heart of social joy;â Thou freezing mist round intellectual mirth, Thou spell-bound vagabond of spurious birth, Away! away! and let the sun shine clear, And all the kindnesses of life appear. With mild complacency, and smiling brow, The host look'd round, and bade the goblets flow; Yet curiously anxious to behold Who first would pay in rhymes instead of gold; Each eye inquiring through the ring was glanced To see who dared the task, who first advanced; That instant started Philip from the throng, Philip, a farmer's son, well known for song,â And, as the mingling whispers round him ran, He humbly bow'd, and timidly began:â THE DRUNKEN FATHER. Poor Ellen married Andrew Hall, Who dwells beside the moor, Where yonder rose-tree shades the wall, And woodbines grace the door. Who does not know how blest, how loved Were her mild laughing eyes By every youth!âbut Andrew proved Unworthy of his prize. In tippling was his whole delight, Each sign-post barr'd his way; He spent in muddy ale at night The wages of the day. Though Ellen still had charms, was young, And he in manhood's prime, She sad beside her cradle sung, And sigh'd away her time. One cold bleak night, the stars were hid, In vain she wish'd him home; Her children cried, half cheer'd, half chid, âO when will father come!â Till Caleb, nine years old, upsprung, And kick'd his stool aside, And younger Mary round him clung, âI'll go, and you shall guide.â The children knew each inch of ground, Yet Ellen had her fears; Light from the lantern glimmer'd round, And show'd her falling tears. âGo by the mill and down the lane; âReturn the same way home: âPerhaps you'll meet him, give him light; âO how I wish he'd come!â Away they went, as close and true As lovers in the shade, And Caleb swung his father's staff At every step he made. The noisy mill-clack rattled on, They saw the water flow, And leap in silvery foam along, Deep murmuring below. âWe'll soon be there,â the hero said, âCome on, 'tis but a mile,â âHere's where the cricket-match was play'd, âAnd here's the shady stile. âHow the light shines up every bough! âHow strange the leaves appear! âHark!âWhat was that?â'tis silent now, âCome, Mary, never fear.â The staring oxen breathed aloud, But never dream'd of harm; A meteor glanced along the cloud That hung o'er Wood-Hill Farm. Old CÃ¦sar bark'd and howl'd hard by, All else was still as death; But Caleb was ashamed to cry, And Mary held her breath. At length they spied a distant light, And heard a chorus brawl; Wherever drunkards stopp'd at night, Why there was Andrew Hall. The house was full, the landlord gay, The bar-maid shook her head, And wish'd the boobies far away That kept her out of bed. There Caleb enter'd, firm, but mild, And spoke in plaintive tone:â âMy mother could not leave the child, âSo we are come alone.â E'en drunken Andrew felt the blow That innocence can give, When its resistless accents flow To bid affection live. âI'm coming, loves, I'm coming now,ââ Then, shuffling o'er the floor, Contrived to make his balance true, And led them from the door. The plain broad path that brought him there By day, though faultless then, Was up and down and narrow grown, Though wide enough for ten. The stiles were wretchedly contrived, The stars were all at play, And many a ditch had moved itself Exactly in his way. But still conceit was uppermost, That stupid kind of pride:â âDost think I cannot see a post? âDost think I want a guide? âWhy, Mary, how you twist and twirl! âWhy dost not keep the track? âI'll carry thee home safe, my girl,ââ Then swung her on his back. Poor Caleb muster'd all his wits To bear the light ahead, As Andrew reel'd and stopp'd by fits, Or ran with thund'ring tread. Exult, ye brutes, traduced and scorn'd, Though true to nature's plan; Exult, ye bristled, and ye horn'd, When infants govern man. Down to the mill-pool's dangerous brink The headlong party drove; The boy alone had power to think, While Mary scream'd above. âStop!â Caleb cried, âyou've lost the path; âThe water's close before; âI see it shine, 'tis very deep,â âWhy, don't you hear it roar?â And then in agony exclaim'd, âO where's my mother now?â The Solomon of hops and malt Stopp'd short and made a bow: His head was loose, his neck disjointed, It cost him little trouble; But, to be stopp'd and disappointed, Poh! danger was a bubble. Onward he stepp'd, the boy alert, Calling his courage forth, Hung like a log on Andrew's skirt, And down he brought them both. The tumb'ling lantern reach'd the stream, Its hissing light soon gone; 'Twas night, without a single gleam, And terror reign'd alone. A general scream the miller heard, Then rubb'd his eyes and ran, And soon his welcome light appear'd, As grumbling he began:â âWhat have we here, and whereabouts? âWhy what a hideous squall! âSome drunken fool! I thought as muchâ â'Tis only Andrew Hall! âPoor children!â tenderly he said, âBut now the danger's past.â They thank'd him for his light and aid, And drew near home at last. But who upon the misty path To meet them forward press'd? 'Twas Ellen, shivering, with a babe Close folded to her breast. Said Andrew, âNow you're glad, I know, âTo se-se-see us come;â âBut I have taken care of both, âAnd brought them bo-bo-both safe home.â With Andrew vex'd, of Mary proud, But prouder of her boy, She kiss'd them both, and sobb'd aloud,â The children cried for joy. But what a home at last they found! Of comforts all bereft; The fire out, the last candle gone, And not one penny left! But Caleb quick as lightning flew, And raised a light instead; And as the kindling brands he blew, His father snored in bed. No brawling, boxing termagant Was Ellen, though offended; Who ever knew a fault like this By violence amended? No:âshe was mild as April morn, And Andrew loved her too; She rose at daybreak, though forlorn, To try what love could do. And as her waking husband groan'd, And roll'd his burning head, She spoke with all the power of truth, Down kneeling by his bed. âDear Andrew, hear me,âthough distress'd âAlmost too much to speak,â âThis infant starves upon my breastâ âTo scold I am too weak. âI work, I spin, I toil all day, âThen leave my work to cry, âAnd start with horror when I think âYou wish to see me die. âBut do you wish it? can that bring âMore comfort, or more joy? âLook round the house, how destitute! âLook at your ragged boy! âThat boy should make a father proud, âIf any feeling can; âThen save your children, save your wife, âYour honour as a man. âHear me, for God's sake hear me now, âAnd act a father's part!â The culprit bless'd her angel tongue, And clasp'd her to his heart; And would have vow'd, and would have sworn, But Ellen kiss'd him dumb,â âExert your mind, vow to yourself, âAnd better days will come. âI shall be well when you are kind, âAnd you'll be better too.ââ âI'll drink no more,ââhe quick rejoin'd,â âBe't poison if I do.â From that bright day his plants, his flowers, His crops began to thrive, And for three years has Andrew been The soberest man alive. Soon as he ended, acelamations 'rose, Endang'ring modesty and self-repose, Till the good host his prudent counsel gave, Then listen'd all, the flippant and the grave. âLet not applauses vanity inspire, âDeter humility, or damp desire; âNeighbours we are, then let the stream run fair, âAnd every couplet be as free as air; âBe silent when each speaker claims his right, âEnjoy the day as I enjoy the sight: âThey shall not class us with the knavish elves, âWho banish shame, and criticise themselves.â Thenceforward converse flow'd with perfect ease, Midst country wit, and rustic repartees. One drank to Ellen, if such might be found, And archly glanced at female faces round. If one with tilted can began to bawl, Another cried, âRemember Andrew Hall.â Then, multifarious topics, corn and hay, Vestry intrigues, the rates they had to pay, The thriving stock, the lands too wet, too dry, And all that bears on fruitful husbandry, Ran mingling through the crowdâa crowd that might, Transferr'd to canvas, give the world delight; A scene that Wilkie might have touch'd with prideâ The May-day banquet then had never died. But who is he, uprisen, with eye so keen, In garb of shining plush of grassy greenâ Dogs climbing round him, eager for the start, With ceaseless tail, and doubly beating heart? A stranger, who from distant forests came, The sturdy keeper of the Oakly game. Short prelude made, he pointed o'er the hill, And raised a voice that every ear might fill; His heart was in his theme, and in the forest still. THE FORESTER. Born in a dark wood's lonely dell, Where echoes roar'd, and tendrils curl'd Round a low cot, like hermit's cell, Old Salcey Forest was my world. I felt no bonds, no shackles then, For life in freedom was begun; I gloried in th' exploits of men, And learn'd to lift my father's gun. O what a joy it gave my heart! Wild as a woodbine up I grew; Soon in his feats I bore a part, And counted all the game he slew. I learn'd the wiles, the shifts, the calls, The language of each living thing; I mark'd the hawk that darting falls, Or station'd spreads the trembling wing. I mark'd the owl that silent flits, The hare that feeds at eventide, The upright rabbit, when he sits And mocks you, ere he deigns to hide. I heard the fox bark through the night, I saw the rooks depart at morn, I saw the wild deer dancing light, And heard the hunter's cheering horn. Mad with delight, I roam'd around From morn to eve throughout the year, But still, midst all I sought or found, My favourites were the spotted deer. The elegant, the branching brow, The doe's clean limbs and eyes of love; The fawn as white as mountain snow, That glanced through fern and brier and grove. One dark, autumnal, stormy day, The gale was up in all its might, The roaring forest felt its sway, And clouds were scudding quick as light: A ruthless crash, a hollow groan, Aroused each self-preserving start, The kine in herds, the hare alone, And shagged colts that grazed apart. Midst fears instinctive, wonder drew The boldest forward, gathering strength As darkness lour'd, and whirlwinds blew, To where the ruin stretch'd his length. The shadowing oak, the noblest stem That graced the forest's ample bound, Had cast to earth his diadem; His fractured limbs had delved the ground. He lay, and still to fancy groan'd; He lay like Alfred when he diedâ Alfred, a king by Heaven enthroned, His age's wonder, England's pride! Monarch of forests, great as good, Wise as the sage,âthou heart of steel! Thy name shall rouse the patriot's blood As long as England's sons can feel. From every lawn, and copse, and glade, The timid deer in squadrons came, And circled round their fallen shade With all of language but its name. Astonishment and dread withheld The fawn and doe of tender years, But soon a triple circle swell'd, With rattling horns and twinkling ears. Some in his root's deep cavern housed, And seem'd to learn, and muse, and teach, Or on his topmost foliage browsed, That had for centuries mock'd their reach. Winds in their wrath these limbs could crash, This strength, this symmetry could mar; A people's wrath can monarchs dash From bigot throne or purple car. When Fate's dread bolt in Claremont's bowers Provoked its million tears and sighs, A nation wept its fallen flowers, Its blighted hopes, its darling prize.â So mourn'd my antler'd friends awhile, So dark, so dread, the fateful day; So mourn'd the herd that knew no guile, Then turn'd disconsolate away! Who then of language will be proud? Who arrogate that gift of Heaven? To wild herds when they bellow loud, To all the forest-tribes 'tis given. I've heard a note from dale or hill That lifted every head and eye; I've heard a scream aloft, so shrill That terror seized on all that fly. Empires may fall, and nations groan, Pride be thrown down, and power decay; Dark bigotry may rear her throne, But science is the light of day. Yet, while so low my lot is cast, Through wilds and forests let me range; My joys shall pomp and power outlastâ The voice of nature cannot change. A soberer feeling through the crowd he flung, Claremont was uppermost on every tongue; But who can live on unavailing sighs? The inconsolable are not the wise. Spirit, and youth, and worth, demand a tearâ That day was past, and sorrow was not here; Sorrow the contest dared not but refuse 'Gainst Oakly's open cellar and the muse. Sir Ambrose cast his eye along the line, Where many a cheerful face began to shine, And, fixing on his man, cried, loud and clear, âWhat have you brought, John Armstrong? let us hear.â Forth stepp'd his shepherd;âscanty locks of gray Edged round a hat that seem'd to mock decay; Its loops, its bands, were from the purest fleece, Spun on the hills in silence and in peace. A staff he bore carved round with birds and flowers, The hieroglyphics of his leisure hours; And rough-form'd animals of various name, Not just like Bewick's, but they meant the same. Nor these alone his whole attention drew, He was a poet,âthis Sir Ambrose knew,â A strange one too;âand now had penn'd a lay, Harmless and wild, and fitting for the day. No tragic tale on stilts;âhis mind had more Of boundless frolic than of serious lore;â Down went his hat, his shaggy friend close by Dozed on the grass, yet watch'd his master's eye. THE SHEPHERD'S DREAM: OR, FAIRIES' MASQUERADE. I had folded my flock, and my heart was o'erflowing, I loiter'd beside the small lake on the heath; The red sun, though down, left his drapery glowing, And no sound was stirring, I heard not a breath: I sat on the turf, but I meant not to sleep, And gazed o'er that lake which for ever is new, Where clouds over clouds appear'd anxious to peep From this bright double sky with its pearl and its blue. Forgetfulness, rather than slumber, it seem'd, When in infinite thousands the fairies arose All over the heath, and their tiny crests gleam'd In mock'ry of soldiers, our friends and our foes. There a stripling went forth, half a finger's length high, And led a huge host to the north with a dash; Silver birds upon poles went before their wild cry, While the monarch look'd forward, adjusting his sash. Soon after a terrible bonfire was seen, The dwellings of fairies went down in their ire; But from all I remember, I never could glean Why the woodstack was burnt, or who set it on fire. The flames seem'd to rise o'er a deluge of snow, That buried its thousands,âthe rest ran away; For the hero had here overstrain'd his long bow, Yet he honestly own'd the mishap of the day. Then the fays of the north like a hailstorm came on, And follow'd him down to the lake in a riot, Where they found a large stone which they fix'd him upon, And threaten'd, and coax'd him, and bade him be quiet. He that conquer'd them all, was to conquer no more, But the million beheld he could conquer alone; After resting awhile, he leap'd boldly on shore, When away ran a fay that had mounted his throne. 'Twas pleasant to see how they stared, how they scamper'd, By furze-bush, by fern, by no obstacle stay'd, And the few that held council were terribly hamper'd, For some were vindictive, and some were afraid. I saw they were dress'd for a masquerade train, Colour'd rags upon sticks they all brandish'd in view, And of such idle things they seem'd mightily vain, Though they nothing display'd but a bird split in two. Then out rush'd the stripling in battle array, And both sides determined to fight and to maul: Death rattled his jawbones to see such a fray, And glory personified laugh d at them all. Here he fail'd,âhence he fled, with a few for his sake, And leap'd into a cockle-shell floating hard by; It sail'd to an isle in the midst of the lake, Where they mock'd fallen greatness, and left him to die. Meanwhile the north fairies stood round in a ring, Supporting his rival on guns and on spears, Who, though not a soldier, was robed like a king; Yet some were exulting, and some were in tears. A lily triumphantly floated above, The crowd press'd, and wrangling was heard through the whole; Some soldiers look'd surly, some citizens strove To hoist the old nightcap on liberty's pole. But methought in my dream some bewail'd him that fell, And liked not his victors so gallant, so clever, Till a fairy stepp'd forward, and blew through a shell, âBear misfortune with firmness, you'll triumph for ever.â I woke at the sound, all in silence, alone, The moor-hens were floating like specks on a glass, The dun clouds were spreading, the vision was gone, And my dog scamper'd round 'midst the dew on the grass. I took up my staff, as a knight would his lance, And said, âHere's my sceptre, my baton, my spear, âAnd there's my prime minister far in advance, âWho serves me with truth for his food by the year.â So I slept without care till the dawning of day, Then trimm'd up my woodbines and whistled amain; My minister heard as he bounded away, And we led forth our sheep to their pastures again. Scorch'd by the shadeless sun on Indian plains, Mellow'd by age, by wants, and toils, and pains, Those toils still lengthen'd when he reach'd that shore Where Spain's bright mountains heard the cannons roar, A pension'd veteran, doom'd no more to roam, With glowing heart thus sung the joys of home. THE SOLDIER'S HOME. My untried muse shall no high tone assume, Nor strut in arms;âfarewell my cap and plume: Brief be my verse, a task within my power, I tell my feelings in one happy hour; But what an hour was that! when from the main I reach'd this lovely valley once again! A glorious harvest fill'd my eager sight, Half shock'd, half waving in a flood of light; On that poor cottage roof where I was born The sun look'd down as in life's early morn. I gazed around, but not a soul appear'd, I listen'd on the threshold, nothing heard; I call'd my father thrice, but no one came; It was not fear or grief that shook my frame, But an o'erpowering sense of peace and home, Of toils gone by, perhaps of joys to come. The door invitingly stood open wide, I shook my dust, and set my staff aside. How sweet it was to breathe that cooler air, And take possession of my father's chair! Beneath my elbow, on the solid frame, Appear'd the rough initials of my name, Cut forty years before!âthe same old clock Struck the same bell, and gave my heart a shock I never cah forget. A short breeze sprung, And while a sigh was trembling on my tongue, Caught the old dangling almanacks behind, And up they flew, like banners in the wind; Then gently, singly, down, down, down, they went, And told of twenty years that I had spent Far from my native land:âthat instant came A robin on the threshold; though so tame, At first he look'd distrustful, almost shy, And cast on me his coal-black stedfast eye, And seem'd to say (past friendship to renew) âAh ha! old worn-out soldier, is it you?â Through the room ranged the imprison'd humble bee, And bomb'd, and bounced, and struggled to be free, Dashing against the panes with sullen roar, That threw their diamond sunlight on the floor; That floor, clean sanded, where my fancy stray'd O'er undulating waves the broom had made, Reminding me of those of hideous forms That met us as we pass'd the Cape of Storms, Where high and loud they break, and peace comes never; They roll and foam, and roll and foam for ever. But here was peace, that peace which home can yield; The grasshopper, the partridge in the field, And ticking clock, were all at once become The substitutes for clarion, fife, and drum. While thus I mused, still gazing, gazing still On beds of moss that spread the window sill, I deem'd no moss my eyes had ever seen Had been so lovely, brilliant, fresh, and green, And guess'd some infant hand had placed it there, And prized its hue, so exquisite, so rare. Feelings on feelings mingling, doubling rose, My heart felt every thing but calm repose; I could not reckon minutes, hours, nor years, But rose at once, and bursted into tears; Then, like a fool, confused, sat down again, And thought upon the past with shame and pain; I raved at war and all its horrid cost, And glory's quagmire, where the brave are lost. On carnage, fire, and plunder, long I mused, And cursed the murdering weapons I had used. Two shadows then I saw, two voices heard, One bespoke age, and one a child's appear'd.â In stepp'd my father with convulsive start, And in an instant clasp'd me to his heart. Close by him stood a little blue-eyed maid, And, stooping to the child, the old man said, âCome hither, Nancy, kiss me once again; âThis is your uncle Charles, come home from Spain.â The child approach'd, and with her fingers light, Stroked my old eyes, almost deprived of sight.â But why thus spin my tale, thus tedious be? Happy old Soldier! what's the world to me? Change is essential to the youthful heart, It cannot bound, it cannot act its part To one monotonous delight a slave; E'en the proud poet's lines become its grave: By innate buoyancy, by passion led, It acts instinctively, it will be fed. A troop of country lasses paced the green, Tired of their seats, and anxious to be seen; They pass'd Sir Ambrose, turn'd, and pass'd again, Some lightly tripp'd, to make their meaning plain: The old man knew it well, the thoughts of youth Came o'er his mind like consciousness of truth, Or like a sunbeam through a lowering sky, It gave him youth again, and ecstacy; He joy'd to see them in this favourite spot, Who of fourscore, or fifty score, would not? He wink'd, he nodded, and then raised his hand,â 'Twas seen and answer'd by the Oakly band. Forth leap'd the light of heart and light of heel, E'en stiff limb'd age the kindling joy could feel. They form'd, while yet the music started light; The grass beneath their feet was short and bright, Where thirty couple danced with all their might. The Forester caught lasses one by one, And twirl'd his glossy green against the sun; The Shepherd threw his doublet on the ground, And clapp'd his hands, and many a partner found: His hat-loops bursted in the jocund fray, And floated o'er his head like blooming May. Behind his heels his dog was barking loud, And threading all the mazes of the crowd; And had he boasted one had wagg'd his tail, And plainly said, âWhat can my master ail?â To which the Shepherd, had he been more cool, Had only said, â'Tis Oakly feast, you fool.â But where was Philip, he who danced so well? Had he retired, had pleasure broke her spell? No, he had yielded to a tend'rer bond, He sat beside his own sick Rosamond, Whose illness long deferr'd their wedding hour; She wept, and seem'd a lily in a shower; She wept to see him 'midst a crowd so gay, For her sake lose the honours of the day. But could a gentle youth be so unkind? Would Philip dance, and leave his girl behind? She in her bosom hid a written prize, Inestimably rich in Philip's eyes; The warm effusion of a heart that glow'd With joy, with love, and hope by Heaven bestow'd. He woo'd, he soothed, and every art assay'd, To hush the scruples of the bashful maid, Drawing, at length, against her weak command, Reluctantly the treasure from her hand: And would have read, but passion chain'd his tongue, He turn'd aside, and down the ballad flung; And paused so long from feeling and from shame, That old Sir Ambrose halloo'd him by name: âBring it to me, my lad, and never fear, âI never blamed true love, or scorn'd a tear; âThey well become us, e'en where branded most.â He came, and made a proxy of his host, Who, as the dancers cooling join'd the throng, Eyed the fair writer as he read her song. ROSAMOND'S SONG OF HOPE. Sweet Hope, so oft my childhood's friend, I will believe thee still, For thou canst joy with sorrow blend, Where grief alone would kill. When disappointments wrung my heart, Ill brook'd in tender years, Thou, like a sun, perform'dst thy part, And dried my infant tears. When late I wore the bloom of health, And love had bound me fast, My buoyant heart would sigh by stealth For fear it might not last. My sickness came, my bloom decay'd, But Philip still was by; And thou, sweet Hope, so kindly said, âHe'll weep if thou should'st die.â Thou told'st me too, that genial Spring Would bring me health again; I feel its power, but cannot sing Its glories yet for pain. But thou canst still my heart inspire, And Heaven can strength renew; I feel thy presence, holy fire! My Philip will be true. All eyes were turn'd, all hearts with pity glow d, The maid stood trembling, and the lover bow'd As rose around them, while she dried her tears, âLong life to Rosamond, and happy years!â Scarce had the voices ceased, when forth there came Another candidate for village fame: By gratitude to Heaven, by honest pride, Impell'd to rise and cast his doubts aside, A sturdy yeoman, button'd to the throat, Faced the whole ring, and shook his leathern coat. âI have a tale of private life to tell, â'Tis all of self and home, I know it well; âIn love and honour's cause I would be strong, âMine is a father's tale, perhaps too long, âFor fathers, when a duteous child's the theme, âCan talk a summer's sun down, and then dream âOf retrospective joys with hearts that glow âWith feelings such as parents only know.â ALFRED AND JENNET. Yes, let me tell of Jennet, my last child; In her the charms of all the rest ran wild, And sprouted as they pleased. Still by my side, I own she was my favourite, was my pride, Since first she labour'd round my neck to twine, Or clasp'd both little hands in one of mine: And when the season broke, I've seen her bring Lapfuls of flowers, and then the girl would sing Whole songs, and halves, and bits, O, with such glee If playmates found a favourite, it was she. Her lively spirit lifted her to joy; To distance in the race a clumsy boy Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye, And all was dance, and laugh, and liberty. Yet not hard-hearted, take me right, I beg, The veriest romp that ever wagg'd a leg Was Jennet; but when pity soothed her mind, Prompt with her tears, and delicately kind. The half-fledged nestling, rabbit, mouse, or dove, By turns engaged her cares and infant love; And many a one, at the last doubtful strife, Warm'd in her bosom, started into life. At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send, My nurse, my faithful clerk, my lively friend; Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep, First on my threshold soon as day could peep: I heard her happy to her heart's desire, With clanking pattens, and a roaring fire. Then, having store of new-laid eggs to spare, She fill'd her basket with the simple fare, And weekly trudged (I think I see her still) To sell them at yon house upon the hill. Oft have I watch'd her as she stroll'd along, Heard the gate bang, and heard her morning song; And, as my warm ungovern'd feelings rose, Said to myself, âHeaven bless her! there she goes.â Long would she tarry, and then dancing home, Tell how the lady bade her oft'ner come, And bade her talk and laugh without control; For Jennet's voice was music to the soul, My tale shall prove it:âFor there dwelt a son, An only child, and where there is but one, Indulgence like a mildew reigns, from whence Mischief may follow if that child wants sense. But Alfred was a youth of noble mind, With ardent passions, and with taste refined: All that could please still courted heart and hand, Music, joy, peace, and wealth, at his command; Wealth, which his widow'd mother deem'd his own; Except the poor, she lived for him alone. Yet would she weep by stealth when he was near, But check'd all sighs to spare his wounded ear; For from his cradle he had never seen Soul-cheering sunbeams, or wild nature's green. But all life's blessings centre not in sight; For Providence, that dealt him one long night, Had given, in pity to the blooming boy, Feelings more exquisitely tuned to joy. Fond to excess was he of all that grew; The morning blossom sprinkled o'er with dew, Across his path, as if in playful freak, Would dash his brow, and weep upon his cheek; Each varying leaf that brush'd where'er he came, Press'd to his rosy lip he call'd by name; He grasp'd the saplings, measured every bough, Inhaled the fragrance that the spring months throw Profusely round, till his young heart confess'd That all was beauty, and himself was bless'd. Yet when he traced the wide extended plain, Or clear brook side, he felt a transient pain; The keen regret of goodness, void of pride, To think he could not roam without a guide. Who, guess ye, knew these scenes of home delight Better than Jennet, bless'd with health and sight? Whene'er she came, he from his sports would slide, And catch her wild laugh, listening by her side; Mount to the tell-tale clock with ardent spring, And feel the passing hour, then fondly cling To Jennet's arm, and tell how sweet the breath Of bright May-mornings on the open heath; Then off they started, rambling far and wide, Like Cupid with a wood-nymph by his side. Thus months and months roll'd on, the summer pass'd, And the long darkness, and the winter blast, Sever'd the pair; no flowery fields to roam, Poor Alfred sought his music and his home. What wonder then if inwardly he pined? The anxious mother mark'd her stripling's mind Gloomy and sad, yet striving to be gay As the long tedious evenings pass'd away: 'Twas her delight fresh spirits to supply.â My girl was sent forâjust for company. A tender governess my daughter found, Her temper placid, her instruction sound; Plain were her precepts, full of strength, their power Was founded on the practice of the hour: Theirs were the happy nights to peace resign'd, With ample means to cheer th' unbended mind. The Sacred History, or the volumes fraught With tenderest sympathy, or towering thought, The laughter-stirring tale, the moral lay, All that brings dawning reason into day. There Jennet learn'd by maps, through every land To travel, and to name them at command; Would tell how great their strength, their bounds how far, And show where uncle Charles was in the war. The globe she managed with a timid hand, Told which was ocean, which was solid land, And said, whate'er their diff'rent climates bore, All still roll'd round, though that I knew before. Thus grown familiar, and at perfect ease, What could be Jennet's duty but to please? Yet hitherto she kept, scarce knowing why, One powerful charm reserved, and still was shy. When Alfred from his grand-piano drew Those heavenly sounds that seem'd for ever new, She sat as if to sing would be a crime, And only gazed with joy, and nodded time. Till one snug evening, I myself was there, The whispering lad inquired, behind my chair, âBowman, can Jennet sing?â âAt home,â said I, âShe sings from morn till night, and seems to fly âFrom tune to tune, the sad, the wild, the merry, âAnd moulds her lip to suit them like a cherry; âShe learn'd them here.âââO ho!â said he, âO ho!â And rubb'd his hands, and stroked his forehead, so. Then down he sat, sought out a tender strain, Sung the first words, then struck the chords again; âCome, Jennet, help me, you must know this song âWhich I have sung, and you have heard so long.â I mark'd the palpitation of her heart, Yet she complied, and strove to take a part, But faint and fluttering, swelling by degrees, Ere self-composure gave that perfect ease, The soul of song:âthen, with triumphant glee, Resting her idle work upon her knee, Her little tongue soon fill'd the room around With such a voluble and magic sound, That, 'spite of all her pains to persevere, She stopp'd to sigh, and wipe a starting tear; Then roused herself for faults to make amends, While Alfred trembled to his fingers' ends. But when this storm of feeling sunk to rest, Jennet, resuming, sung her very best, And on the ear, with many a dying fall, She pour'd th' enchanting âHarp of Tara's Hall.â Still Alfred hid his raptures from her view, Still touch'd the keys, those raptures to renew, And led her on to that sweet past'ral air, The Highland Laddie with the yellow hair. She caught the sound, and with the utmost ease Bade nature's music triumph, sure to please: Such truth, such warmth, such tenderness express'd, That my old heart was dancing in my breast. Up sprung the youth, âO Jennet, where's your hand? âThere's not another girl in all the land, âIf she could bring me empires, bring me sight, âCould give me such unspeakable delight: âYou little baggage! not to tell before âThat you could sing; mindâyou go home no more.â Thus I have seen her from my own fire-side Attain the utmost summit of her pride; For, from that singing hour, as time roll'd round, At the great house my Jennet might be found, And, while I watch'd her progress with delight, She had a father's blessing every night, And grew in knowledge at that moral school Till I began to guess myself a fool. Music! why she could play as well as he! At least I thought so,âbut we'll let that be: She read the poets, grave and light, by turns, And talk'd of Cowper's âTask,â and Robin Burns; Nay, read without a book, as I may say, As much as some could within half a day. 'Twas thus I found they pass'd their happy time, In all their walks, when nature in her prime Spread forth her scents and hues, and whisper'd love And joy to every bird in every grove; And though their colours could not meet his eye, She pluck'd him flowers, then talk'd of poetry. Once on a sunbright morning, 'twas in June, I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune, And idly rambled forth, as if t' explore The little valley just before my door; Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat Beneath the clustering thorns, a snug retreat For poets, as I deem'd, who often prize Such holes and corners far from human eyes; I mark'd young Alfred, led by Jennet, stray Just to the spot, both chatting on their way: They came behind me, I was still unseen; He was the elder, Jennet was sixteen. My heart misgave me, lest I should be deem'd A prying listener, never much esteem'd, But this fear soon subsided, and I said, âI'll hear this blind lad and my little maid.â That instant down she pluck'd a woodbine wreath, The loose leaves rattled on my head beneath; This was for Alfred, which he seized with joy, âO, thank you, Jennet,â said the generous boy. Much was their talk, which many a theme supplied, As down they sat, for every blade was dried. I would have skulk'd away, but dare not move, âBesides,â thought I, âthey will not talk of love;â But I was wrong, for Alfred, with a sigh, A little tremulous, a little shy, But, with the tenderest accents, ask'd his guide A question which might touch both love and pride. âThis morning, Jennet, why did you delay, âAnd talk to that strange clown upon your way, âOur homespun gardener? how can you bear âHis screech-owl tones upon your perfect ear? âI cannot like that man, yet know not why, âHe's surely quite as old again as I; âHe's ignorant, and cannot be your choice, âAnd ugly too, I'm certain, by his voice, âBesides, he call'd you pretty.âââWell, what then? âI cannot hide my face from all the men; âAlfred, indeed, indeed, you are deceived, âHe never spoke a word that I believed; âNay, can he think that I would leave a home âFull of enjoyment, present, and to come, âWhile your dear mother's favours daily prove âHow sweet the bonds of gratitude and love? âNo, while beneath her roof I shall remain, âI'll never vex you, never give you pain.â âEnough, my life,â he cried, and up they sprung; By Heaven, I almost wish'd that I was young; It was a dainty sight to see them pass, Light as the July fawns upon the grass, Pure as the breath of spring when forth it spreads, Love in their hearts, and sunshine on their heads. Next day I felt what I was bound to do, To weigh the adventure well, and tell it too; For Alfred's mother must not be beguiled, He was her earthly hope, her only child; I had no wish, no right to pass it by, It might bring grief, perhaps calamity. She was the judge, and she alone should know Whether to check the flame or let it grow. I went with fluttering heart, and moisten'd eye, But strong in truth, and arm'd for her reply. âWell, master Bowman, why that serious face?â Exclaim'd the lovely dame, with such a grace, That had I knelt before her, I had been Not quite the simplest votary ever seen. I told my tale, and urged that well-known truth, That the soft passion in the bloom of youth Starts into power, and leads th' unconscious heart A chase where reason takes but little part; Nothing was more in nature, or more pure, And from their habits nothing was more sure Whether the lady blush'd from pride or joy, I could but guess;âat length she saidââMy boy âDropp'd not a syllable of this to me! âWhat was I doing, that I could not see? âThrough all the anxious hours that I have known, âHis welfare still was dearer than my own; âHow have I mourn'd o'er his unhappy fate! âBlind as he is! the heir to my estate! âI now might break his heart, and Jennet's too; âWhat must I, Bowman, or what can I do?ââ âDo, madam?â said I boldly, âif you trace âImpending degradation or disgrace âIn this attachment, let us not delay; âSend my girl home, and check it while you may.â âI will,â she said, but the next moment sigh'd; Parental love was struggling hard with pride. I left her thus, deep musing, and soon found My daughter, for I traced her by the sound Of Alfred's flageolet; no cares had they, But in the garden bower spent half the day. By starts he sung, then wildest trillings made, To mock a piping blackbird in the glade. I turn'd a corner and approach'd the pair; My little rogue had roses in her hair! She whipp'd them out, and with a downcast look, Conquer'd a laugh by poring on her book. My object was to talk with her aside, But at the sight my resolution died; They look'd so happy in their blameless glee, That, as I found them, I e'en let them be; Though Jennet promised a few social hours 'Midst her old friends, my poultry, and my flowers. She came,âbut not till fatal news had wrung Her heart through sleepless hours, and chain'd her tongue. She came, but with a look that gave me pain, For, though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain, Though every brood came round, half run, half fly, I knew her anguish by her alter'd eye; And strove, with all my power, where'er she came, To soothe her grief, yet gave it not a name. At length a few sad bitter tears she shed, And on both hands reclined her aching head. 'Twas then my time the conqueror to prove, I summon'd all my rhetoric, all my love. âJennet, you must not think to pass through life âWithout its sorrows, and without its strife; âGood, dutiful, and worthy, as you are, âYou must have griefs, and you must learn to bear.â Thus I went on, trite moral truths to string,â All chaff, mere chaff, where love has spread his wing: She cared not, listen'd not, nor seem'd to know What was my aim, but wiped her burning brow, Where sat more eloquence and living power Than language could embody in an hour. With soften'd tone I mention'd Alfred's name, His wealth, our poverty, and that sad blame Which would have weigh'd me down, had I not told The secret which I dare not keep for gold, Of Alfred's love, o'erheard the other morn, The gardener, and the woodbine, and the thorn; And added, âThough the lady sends you home, âYou are but young, child, and a day may comeââ âShe has not sent me home,â the girl replied, And rose with sobs of passion from my side; âShe has not sent me home, dear father, no; âShe gives me leave to tarry or to go; âShe has not blamed me,âyet she weeps no less, âAnd every tear but adds to my distress; âI am the cause,âthus all that she has done âWill bring the death or misery of her son. âJealous he might be, could he but have seen âHow other lads approach'd where I have been; âBut this man's voice offends his very soul, âThat strange antipathy brooks no control; âAnd should I leave him now, or seem unkind, âThe thought would surely wreck his noble mind; âTo leave him thus, and in his utmost need! âPoor Alfred! then you will be blind indeed! âI will not leave him.âââNay, child, do not rave; âWhat, would you be his menial, be his slave?â âYes,â she exclaim'd, and wiped each streaming eye, âYes, be his slave, and serve him till I die; âHe is too just to act the tyrant's part, âHe's truth itself.â O how my burthen'd heart Sigh'd for relief!âsoon that relief was found; Without one word we traced the meadow round, Her feverish hand in mine, and weigh'd the case, Nor dared to look each other in the face; Till, with a sudden stop, as if from fear, I roused her sinking spirit, âWho comes here?â Down the green slope before us, glowing warm, Came Alfred, tugging at his mother's arm; Willing she seem'd, but he still led the way, She had not walk'd so fast for many a day; His hand was lifted, and his brow was bare, For now no clust'ring ringlets wanton'd there, He threw them back in anger and in spleen, And shouted âJennetâ o'er the daisied green. Boyish impatience strove with manly grace In ev'ry line and feature of his face; His claim appear'd resistless as his choice, And when he caught the sound of Jennet's voice, And when with spotless soul he clasp'd the maid, My heart exulted while my breath was staid. âJennet, we must not part! return again; âWhat have I done to merit all this pain? âDear mother, share my fortune with the poor, âJennet is mine, and shall beâsay no more; âBowman, you know not what a friend I'll be; âGive me your daughter, Bowman, give her me; âJennet, what will my days be if you go? âA dreary darkness, and a life of woe: âMy dearest love, come home, and do not cry; âYou are my daylight, Jennet, I shall die.â To such appeals all prompt replies are cold, And stately prudence snaps her cobweb hold. Had the good widow tried, or wish'd to speak, This was a bond she could not, dared not break; Their hearts (you never saw their likeness, never) Were join'd, indissolubly join'd for ever. Why need I tell how soon our tears were dried, How Jennet blush'd, how Alfred with a stride Bore off his prize, and fancied every charm, And clipp'd against his ribs her trembling arm; How mute we seniors stood, our power all gone? Completely conquer'd, Love the day had won, And the young vagrant triumph'd in our plight, And shook his roguish plumes, and laugh'd outright. Yet, by my life and hopes, I would not part With this sweet recollection from my heart; I would not now forget that tender scene To wear a crown, or make my girl a queen. Why need be told how pass'd the months along, How sped the summer's walk, the winter's song, How the foil'd suitor all his hopes gave up, How Providence with rapture fill'd their cup? No dark regrets, no tragic scenes to prove, The gardener was too old to die for love. A thousand incidents I cast aside To tell but oneâI gave away the brideâ Gave the dear youth what kings could not have given; Then bless'd them both, and put my trust in Heaven. There the old neighbours laugh'd the night away, Who talk of Jennet's wedding to this day. And could you but have seen the modest grace, The half-hid smiles that play'd in Jennet's face, Or mark'd the bridegroom's bounding heart o'erflow, You might have wept for joy, as I could now: I speak from memory of days long past; Though 'tis a father's tale, I've done at last. Here rest thee, rest thee, Muse, review the scene Where thou with me from peep of dawn hast been: We did not promise that this motley throng Should every one supply a votive song, Nor every tenant:âyet thou hast been kind, For untold tales must still remain behind, Which might o'er listening patience still prevail, Did fancy waver not, nor daylight fail. âThe Soldier's Wife,â her toils, his battles o'er, âLove in a Shower,â the riv'let's sudden roar; Then, âLines to Aggravationâ form the close, Parent of murders, and the worst of woes. But while the changeful hours of daylight flew, Some homeward look'd, and talk'd of evening dew; Some watch'd the sun's decline, and stroll'd around, Some wish'd another dance, and partners found; When in an instant every eye was drawn To one bright object on the upper lawn; A fair procession from the mansion came, Unknown its purport, and unknown its aim. No gazer could refrain, no tongue could cease, It seem'd an embassy of love and peace. Nearer and nearer still approach'd the train, Age in the van transform'd to youth again. Sir Ambrose gazed, and scarce believed his eyes; 'Twas magic, memory, love, and blank surprise, For there his venerable lady wore The very dress which, sixty years before, Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn, Had sparkled, ay, beneath this very thorn! Her hair was snowy white, o'er which was seen, Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been, A twin red roseâno other ornament Had pride suggested, or false feeling lent; She came to grace the triumph of her lord, And pay him honours at his festive board. Nine ruddy lasses follow'd where she stepp'd; White were their virgin robes, that lightly swept The downy grass; in every laughing eye Cupid had skulk'd, and written âvictory.â What heart on earth its homage could refuse? Each tripp'd, unconsciously, a blushing Muse. A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound Their clustering ringlets in a magic round. And, as they slowly moved across the green, Each in her beauty seem'd a May-day queen. The first a wreath bore in her outstretch'd hand, The rest a single rose upon a wand; Their steps were measured to that grassy throne Where, watching them, Sir Ambrose sat alone. They stopp'd,âwhen she, the foremost of the row, Curtsied, and placed the wreath upon his brow; The rest, in order pacing by his bower, In the loop'd wreath left each her single flower,â Then stood aside.âWhat broke the scene's repose? The whole assembly clapp'd their hands and rose. The Muses charm'd them as they form'd a ring, And look'd the very life and soul of Spring! But still the white hair'd dame they view'd with pride, Her love so perfect, and her truth so tried. Oh, sweet it is to hear, to see, to name, Unquench'd affection in the palsied frameâ To think upon the boundless raptures past, And love, triumphant, conquering to the last! Silenced by feeling, vanquish'd by his tears, The host sprung up, nor felt the weight of years; Yet utterance found not, though in virtue's cause, But acclamations fill'd up nature's pause, Till, by one last and vigorous essay, His tide of feeling roll'd itself away; The language of delight its bondage broke, And many a warm heart bless'd him as he spoke. âNeighbours and friends, by long experience proved, âPardon this weakness; I was too much moved: âMy dame, you see, cau youth and age insnare, âIn vain I strove, 'twas more than I could bear,â âYet hear me,âthough the tyrant passions strive, âThe words of truth, like leading stars, survive; âI thank you all, but will accomplish moreâ âYour verses shall not die as heretofore; âYour local tales shall not be thrown away, âNor war remain the theme of every lay. âOurs is an humbler task, that may release âThe high-wrought soul, and mould it into peace. âThese pastoral notes some victor's ear may fill, âBreathed amidst blossoms, where the drum is still: âI purpose then to send them forth to try âThe public patience, or its apathy. âThe world shall see them; why should I refrain? â'Tis all the produce of my own domain. âFarewell!â he said, then took his lady's arm, On his shrunk hand her starting tears fell warm; Again he turn'd to view the happy crowd, And cried, âGood night, good night, good night,â aloud, âHealth to you all! for see, the evening closes,â Then march'd to rest, beneath his crown of roses. âHappy old man! with feelings such as these, âThe seasons all can charm, and trifles please.â An instantaneous shout re-echoed round, 'Twas wine and gratitude inspired the sound: Some joyous souls resumed the dance again, The aged loiter'd o'er the homeward plain, And scatter'd lovers rambled through the park, And breathed their vows of honour in the dark; Others a festal harmony preferr'd, Still round the thorn the jovial song was heard; Dance, rhymes, and fame, they scorn'd such things as these, But drain'd the mouldy barrel to its lees, As if 'twere worse than shame to want repose: Nor was the lawn clear till the moon arose, And on each turret pour'd a brilliant gleam Of modest light, that trembled on the stream; The owl awoke, but dared not yet complain, And banish'd silence re-assumed her reign.
