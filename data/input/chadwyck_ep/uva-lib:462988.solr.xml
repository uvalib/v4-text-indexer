The conueyaunce of a dreme how Desyre went to the castell of pleasure / wherin was the gardyn of affeccyon inhabyted by Beaute to whome he amerously expressed his loue upon the whiche supplycacyon rose grete stryfe dysputacyon / and argument betwene Pyte and Dysdayne. Coplande the prynter to the auctor. Your mynde consydered / &amp; your good entent Theffecte regarded / in euery maner case Your cyrcumstaunce / and labour dylygent Who wyll construe / is of grete effycace Your sentences morally tenbrace Concerneth reason of lauryate grauyte Yonge tender hertes / talecte with amyte Your aege also flourynge in vyrent youthe So to bestowe is gretly to commende Bookes to endyte of maters ryght uncouthe Ensample gyuynge to all suche as pretende In tharte of loue theyr myndes to condescende In termes freshe / theyr courage to endewe Not with rude toyes / but elegant and newe Yet ben there many that lytell regarde Your pleasures castell / inhabyte with beaute And I am sure wolde gyue but small rewarde For this your labour / and studyous dyte But had ye compyled some maner subtylte Lucre to gete / theyr neyghbour to begyle They wolde alowe it a perfyte dyscrete style Thauctor. My boke of loue / belonges to no suche arte But to the pleasure / is his hoole affeccyon Of gentyll people / whiche lyketh to take parte In pleasaunt youth / with amorous dyleccyon Honour regarded / in clene cyrcumspeccyon Layenge a parte / all wylfull vayne desyre To conforte them that brenne in louynge fyre Coplande. Bokes of loue innumerable prynted be I mene of ladyes / and many a hardy knyght Without regarde of sensuall nycete In loue exploytynge / truely with all theyr myght But loue of golde / these dayes blyndeth the syght Of men and women / hauynge theyr delyte Onely for mede to do theyr appetyte. Thauctor. Enprynt this boke / Coplande at my request And put it forth to euery maner of state It doeth no good lyenge styll in my chyst To passe the tyme some wyll bye it algate Cause it is newe / compyled now of late At leest way yonge folke / wyll gladly seke recure Beauty to gete in the toure of pleasure. Coplande. At your instaunce / I shall it gladly impresse But the utteraunce I thynke wyll be but smale Bokes be not set by theyr tymes is past I gesse The dyse and kardes / in drynkynge wyne and ale Tables / cayles / and balles / they be nowe set a sale Men let theyr chyldren use al suche harlotry That byenge of bokes they utterly deny Finit prologus En passant le temps sans mal peucer. [The Castell of Pleasure.] Tornyng &amp; trauersynge hystoryes unstedfaste In Ouydes bokes of transformacyon It was my fortune and chaunce at the laste In ouerturnyng of the leues to se in what facyon Phebus was inflamyd by inspyracyon Of cruell cupyde to hym immercyable Whiche of hym was worthy no commendacyon Shewynge hymselfe alwayes deceyuable Therfore I wolde gladly yf I were able The maner playnly and in fewe wordes dysclose How phebus and cupyd togyer were compenable Fyrst it to shewe I wyll me dyspose Phebus set on pryde and hault in corage Spake these wordes of grete audacyte Cupyde thou boy of yonge and tender aege How mayst thou be so bolde to compare with me These arowes becomes me as thou mayst clerely se Wherwith I maye wounde bothe man and beste And for that at all creatures be subgect to the So moche is thy power lesse than myn at eche feste Well well sayd cupyde it lyketh you to geste This sayd / he assended to the mount pernassus On the hyght his armes shortly abrode he keste And sayd I trust I shall this in haste dyscusse. For a profe he toke forth of his arowy quyver A golden darte with loue ryght penytrable Made sharpe at the poynt that it myght enter With it he stroke phebus with a stroke ryght lamentable It to resyste he was weyke and unable The stroke of his power who can or may resyste But he must obey / and to loue be agreable Constreyned by cupyde whiche may stryke whome he lyst Another darte he toke soone in his fyste Contrary to thoder ledyn blont and heuy With this he stroke Phebus loue or she wyste So that the more he desyred the more she dyd deny Her name was Daphnys whiche deuoyde of loue By dame saunce mercy whiche made hym to complayne Cupyde in sondry wyse his power dyde proue On thone with loue on thoder with dysdayne Thone dyd fle thoder wolde optayne Thone was gladde thoder was in wo Thone was pencyfe and oppressed with payne Thoder in Ioye cared not thoughe it were so By fere and dysdayne she dyd hym ouergo Lyke to an hare she ranne in haste He folowed lyke a grehounde desyre wrought hym wo But all was in vayne his labour was but waste. The nyght drewe nye the daye was at a syde My herte was heuy I moche desyred rest Whan without confort alone I dyd abyde Seynge the shadowes fall frome the hylles in the west Eche byrde under boughe drewe nye to theyr nest The chymneys frome ferre began to smoke Eche housholder went about to lodge his gest The storke ferynge stormes toke the chymney for a cloke Eche chambre and chyst were soone put under locke Curfew was ronge lyghtes were set up in haste They that were without for lodgynge soone dyd knocke Which were playne precedentes the daye was clerely paste Thus a slepe I fell by a sodayne chaunce Whan I lacked lyght alone without conforte My sore study with slouthe dyde me enhaunce Myn eyes were heuy my tonge without dysporte Caused many fantasyes to me to resorte My herte was moche musynge my mynde was varyaunt So I was troubled with this ungracyous sorte That my herte &amp; mynde to slouthe shortely dyde graunt Aboute the whiche whyles I was attendaunt Sodaynly came Morpheus &amp; at a brayde Not affrayd but lyke a man ryght valyaunt Couragyously to me these wordes he sayde. Morpheus. Well knowen it is and noysed for a trothe Thoughe perchaunce it hath not attayned yet to your audyence How Desyre in mynde hath made a solempne othe Beaute to serue without resistence So to contynue he doeth ryght well prepence Durynge his lyfe with loue stedfast and sure In parfyte loue to kepe one contynuaunce It is his mynde to do her suche pleasure. On faruent loue he set holy his mynde Loue is his pleasure yet loue putteth hym to payne Moche rule I ensure you hath nature and kynde In hym as is possyble in one to remayne He wolde fayne haue release and dare not yet complayne Howbeit to suche a poynte he is now brought That eyther to shewe his mynde he must shortly be fayne Or elles his Ioye is clerely solde and bought. For the whiche it is done me to understande That he wyll shortly now expresse his entent And this they saye he wyll take on hande To go to her presence wherfore be dylygent And walke with me and be obedyent And I shall soone knowe how he shall spede I must of duety holde me content So ye supporte me alwaye whan I haue nede The mountayne of courage This sayd sodaynly by a chaunce repentyne I was ascendynge a goodly mountayne About the whiche the sonne ouer eche syde dyd shyne Wherof the coulour made my herte ryght fayne To se the golden valeyes bothe fayre and playne But whan I to the toppe was nye auaunced None of my Ioyntes coude togyder contayne For Ioye my herte leped and my body daunced. What call ye this hyll I pray you tell This is the mountayne of lusty courage This hath ben inhabyted of many a rebell As unkyndnes / enmyte / dysdayne / and dotage But now they be dystroyed by marcyall apparage So that now adayes here dwelleth none Yet dysdayne hath goten a more stately auauntage For in the castell of pleasure she troubles many one. Now goodly Iustes here on they excersyse By thactyfnes of many a champyon And these well gargaled galeryes they dyd deuyse To thentente that ladyes myght haue prospeccyon And to suche as were worthy graunte loue &amp; affeccyon And also whan theyr lust were theyr courage to use To daunce amonges them they toke a dyreccyon As they myght well and not them selfe abuse Whan I aduerted of these galeryes the quadrant facyon The meruaylous mountayne so well made playne Me thought that syth the incarnacyon Was neuer seen a more goodly mountayne For Ioye my herte leped I was so fayne Of it I was so ioyous and so well appade I coude in no wyse my mynde refrayne To suche tyme this as prayse of it I made O puyssaunt courage chefe cause of conforte Thou mayst well be nye the castell of pleasure O hyll thupholder of all doughty dysporte Of marcyall manhode thou arte the treasure Out of thy bankes is goten the ure That causeth the pastymes of parfyte prowes O mountayne god graunt the longe to endure Syth thou arte lanterne of lastynge lustynes. So forth we walked on that goodly hyll To that we came to the bankes syde To se the fayre castell than we stode styll And to se the rennynge ryuer there we dyde abyde To haue a lowe water we taryed the tyde The name of this water then thus he dyd expresse To dystroye chaungeable &amp; peple oppressed with pryde They call this water the lauer of lowlynes On the stones of stedfastnes rennes this water clere To ouercome folkes chaungeable &amp; proude of herte &amp; mynde Suche men shall be put in ryght grete daunger For than swelleth the water contrary to his kynde So that they can not the steppynge stone fynde By the meane wherof they be troubled so sore With the wylde wawes wauerynge with the wynde That for lacke of helpe they are ryght soone forlore. But blessed be god we came in good season Well passe this same I trust we shall in haste Be not flowyshe but arme you with reason How ye shall gete ouer in mynde afore well caste To be to forwarde ye may soone make waste So forth we wente in pacyent humylyte And whan I this water was well past I loked backe and sayd this in breuyte. O lowly lauer slydynge ouer the stones of stedfastnes O ryall ryuer whiche proueth perfytely All proude people that delytes in doublenes Thou drownest them in thy stremys ryght shortly Thou hast a more praysable proprety Then euer had the well of helycon The mother of mekenes conserue the perpetually Syth thou arte the mother water of vertues many one So whan I towarde the castell dyrected my loke Whiche then was not from me a full stones caste I remembred that I had redde in many a boke That in this place of plesure were many a stormy blast Notwith stondynge I thought all perylles had be past Whan I sawe of this castell the royall gates Yet afore I knewe that pleasour coude not last There as dysdayne is in fauour with estates This royall castell was on eche syde quadraunt Gargaled with goodly grehoundes &amp; beestes many one The tyrannous tygre the stronge &amp; myghty elephaunt With a castell on his backe whiche he bare alone The lyons fyry eyes with rubyes there shone The golden grephyn with clees of asure The unycorne alowe with a rufull mone Stode there as desolate of lyuely creature. The walles were allectynge of adamantes The wyndowes of crystall were well fortyfyed And as I was lokynge on these elyphauntes On the gates two scryptures I aspyed Them for to rede my mynde than I applyed Wryten in golde and yndye blewe for folkes furtheraunce They betoken two wayes as after well I tryed These scryptures as I remembre thus sowned in substaunce Who as in to this place wyll take his entrynge Must of these wayes haue fre eleccyon Yf he lyst be lusty lepe daunce and synge Or yf in worldly welthe he set his affeccyon In honour ryches or prosperous inuencyon He shall be conueyed yf he wyll so ensewe Elles to the scrypture underneth let hym gyue intencyon Whiche is set out in letters of yndye blewe. Who so doeth sette his pleasure and delyte His faruent herte to conioyne stedfastly On the loue of Beaute a blossom ryght wyte Or on ony of her ladyes let hym ententyfely Be content his mynde and courage to apply To suche as to conduyt all folkes lyeth in wayte For none can without theyr leue passe them by Nor yet attayne to beautes hygh estate This sayd my mynde mused gretely Whiche of these wayes I was best to take Wherby I called to remembraunce shortly How Hercules of aege but tendre and wake New at yeres of dyscresyon his mynde sore brake Whan he sawe two wayes the one of virtue the other of pleasure And of the nyght it caused hym ryght ofte to wake By cause he knewe not the waye of pefyte measure. Yet suche was his fortune ryght happy was his chaunce Whiche toke the waye so moche praysable This to pleasure and welthe doeth men auaunce This other doeth enduce one to be amyable I am hereby moche troubled my mynde is unstable What remedy shall I fynde to make my mynde stedfast I wyll endeuer me to reason to be conformable All my wyttes serched I trust it so to caste This golden scrypture is ryght moche pleasaunte And hath dampned the eyes of men many one I am sore troubled to whiche waye sholde I graunte Syth I am now here in maner as man alone This loue lasteth whan all ryches is gone Therfore I thynke it best with it to be content Consyderynge that fewe theyr mysfortune wyll mone That haue mo faces than hertes as dayly is euydent.

Beaute. Ye knowe well fantasy I am nothynge accompanyed Lyke as I wolde be whan he shall attayne my presence Therfore as best is let this be applyed Go ye and call hyther your syster credence Let eloquence be nyghe lest there happeth some offence For it is mete they be nyghe at this grete besynes Quod dysdayne it is mete my lady haue preemynens Lyke as becometh her estate and noblenes Forth went fantasy to do her message Desyre thought he taryed very longe And sore he was moeued with faruent corage He thought he wold Ieoperde though it sholde happen wrong And in his grete trouble he called fantasye amonge Saynge ye forgete ye hede not my grete payne Yf som chaunce haue happed her I may synge a woful song Or elles I fere me she be let by dysdayne.

O excellent empresse whiche guydeth in your guardon This goodly gardyn of amyable affeccyon Whiche also graunteth to true louers pardon All obstynate people ye subdue to correccyon It is also in your power and eleccyon Louers to redress under Venus ye haue moste power By you they must be ordered after your dyreccyon Whiche in your gardyn sholde gader ony floure. Pleaseth your hyghnes to gyue hede and intent To this expressynge of my wofull payne Late to slepe whan I was dylygent To me there happed a grete cause to complayne None erthly conforte coude in me remayne Cupyde had bewrapped myne herte so sore To serche meane to slepe it was but vayne I was neuer so troubled syth that tyme nor before. To me there came as I well perceyued Late sent from Cupyde a golden darte ryght hote Whiche perced me so sore whan I it fyrst receyued That neyther salues nor surgyens coude helpe nor be my bote They durst not serche the wounde it laye at myn herte rote And for that there was but one that coude it remedy It pleased me not than to go to here a mote But ofte on Cupyde it caused me out to crye. It was your loue whiche was cause of all this I can not denye it but shewe it in wordes playne I durst to none erthy shewe my woo as it is To overcome this feruent loue I dyde my besy payne But when I sawe it auyled not than I was fayne To labour for socour then I thought it best But yf ones grace be shewed none can sure helth obteyne Thefore trustynge on pyte of this poynt I dyde rest. Wherefore o lady preelecte pryncesse On all louers hauynge the soueraynty I hertely beseche you my wo to redresse The cause consydered of my grete ieoperdy I trust ye nether wyll ne can this my request deny For I haue founde suche grace in your eyes or this That yf all the peryll in the worlde sholde on it ly I coude not forbere but tell you as it is. No worldly ryches to you I can promyse Moste I can saye is that ye shall be my moste conforte But god which to al folkes after theyr merites can deuyse Rewarde or punishement moste egally he doeth sorte He is the lorde of pyte Iusques a la mort Gyue you rewarde and preserue you at all houres Of perfyte loue he bereth a pryncy porte And to encrease my Ioye I aske no more but yours Dysdayne A proude presumptuous persone goeth neuer without offence Ye haue well aquyted you now ye haue tolde this tale It came of a hyghe wyt yf ye well prepence Within her owne gardyn my lady to assaylle Without her lycence it lyked you to rayle On cruell Cupyde your pryde wyll haue a fall I trust to se you gladde your bonet to auayle And amonge the waykest be put backe to the wall Lyke as a sodayn rebuke moche greueth ones herte Whiche late hath begonne to be aduenturous So this caused desyre sore astonyed to sterte Sayenge I haue attempted a thyng ryght Ieopardous To attayne the presence of my lady moste beautyus I can make none answere nor utterly denye That but I haue presumed on a loue precyous It in this case I blame but hope and fantasy I knowe no remedy what is best to be done But yf pyte with this pryncesse be present I may as well elles go muse about the mone As hyther to come to shewe myn intent As longe as dysdayne contynueth yll content Wherfore for pyte I hertly call and crye That she were with beaute me thynke it expedyent To dysdayne in open audyence then spake pyte Pyte. What moeueth you dysdayne this man this to reproue Whiche I am sure came in none yll entent But to expresse and represse his mynde &amp; faruent loue Hath he ony ungoodly wordes in my ladyes presence spent I perceyue no pryde in hym me thynketh hym dylygent And yf ye haue ony cause in hym now speke Yf not / I assure you I can not be content That with unsyttynge wordes ye shold his herte thus breke Dysdayne. Fayre maystres I made not these wordes on my fyngers Wene ye I wolde speke them &amp; haue no grounde wheron But fyrst I wyll say I shrewe his fyrst bryngers In the parlour without the gate he myght haue stand alone But I wyll tell you my causes syth ye be suche one As must haue accomptes / nay therof ye shall pardon me I wyll seke for an other whiche shall my trubles mone I wyll fyrst knowe your rule / what wote ye where ye be Pyte. Ye well ynoughe it semeth better then you Except to reason ye be more conformable It is my ladyes power our reasons to allowe I take no suche thnge on me I knowe I am not able I haue neyther power ne commaundement but as is agreable To my ladyes pleasure but by reasons to make argument That suche reasons well weyed my mynde may be stable And by contraryous reasons to serche out his true entent Dysdayne. I am content to put my cause in to my ladyes handes As it shall please her I must hold me content But I owe you no seruyce I holde of you no landes To shewe you my cause afore my lady I consent Let her ordre me as she shall thynke conuenyent Why sholde he come without leue to her presence Answere to this as ye thynke expedyent Me thynke to my lady he hath done a grete offence. Pyte The cause consydered I trust ye wyll saye That whan he came hyther he mynded no dyspleasure As to warde my lady he came for the next waye And as in his wordes he hath ordred hym by measure He neyther sought hyther for golde ne treasure But cupyde constrayned his courage to make more haste And but yf ye fynde some other cause then this I am sure For this my lady wyll not hym out of her fauoure caste Dysdayne. Forther he hath made a grete exclamacyon Complaynynge on cupyde callynge hym cause of his wo Saynge in this wyse or moche after this facyon The golden darte of Cupyde constreyneth me lo I can not se by what meane it sholde be so Sayenge he desyreth my lady it to redresse For than he sholde haue sought to Venus as many one do And haue made his complaynt to that excellent goddesse Pyte. And yf ye well consyder he is worthy more prayse That he to my lady made his supplycacyon Than yf he had compassed her by more crafty wayes It cometh of a good courage &amp; he is worthy commendacyon That he dare speke and trust to haue no replycacyon Agayne his mynde feruent loue was cause of this The whiche in hym had so grete operacyon To make hym tell the trouth were it well or amysse. Dysdayne. Wene ye he be so feruente nay I waraunt you he shall lyue Yf neuer more trouble came to his herte Wene ye without cause he wolde to her loue gyue Not knowynge her mynde to make hym so to smerte He can well ynoughe fayne loue Ouyde layde aparte De arte amandi whiche techeth one to loue Or els the squyer of venus dyd hym in the euenynge starte And so to cast his fantasy hym sodaynly dyd moeue Pyte. Nay his colour dyscryueth of loue the feruent fyre He is not crystened that can suche countynaunce fayne Iupyter whiche had subdued many to his empyre As sodaynly with loue Cupyde dyd hym retayne And whan he to danaes in a golden shoure dyde complayne His grefe consydered and well knowen for a trothe She graunted hym loue and caused hym to remayne What wyll ye haue forther than sure promyse and othe Dysdayne. As for promyse and othe I lytell them regarde For as it is sayd wordes is nothynge but wynde Was not parys false of promyse and harde Whan to Enone he was so unkynde Whiche by a solempne othe to her dyd hym bynde That he wolde mary her in all goodly haste But whan the golden apple .iii. goddesses dyd fynde His Iugement fulfylled his wordes proued but waste Pyte. He was enflamed but by aduenture His pouerte made hym content his mynde to expresse Yet whan of his Iugement he had theffect &amp; pleasure None of his dedes accorded shortly nor in processe But the dedes of Desyre folowed doubtles For accordynge to his wordes he made grete labour Hertely requyrynge my lady hym to redresse Promysynge her the utterest of his lytle power. Dysdayne. Perchaunce that was more for ryches than for loue Or bycause of her grete parentage he dyd to her sewe So many one hath done as by experyence I can proue Whiche appereth so euedently that I need no exemples shewe Mo laboreth for lucre whan a thynge is fallen newe Than by feruent loue to attayne hault noblenes Whiche causeth oft ladyes in heuy case to rewe And be more ware to whome they theyr myndes expresse Pyte. Thoughe many one hath so done can ye thynke in your reason That desyre so entendyd whan he hyther came Consyder it well and ye wyll thynke at this season It was faruent courage that brought hym to his blame Whiche had suche power in hym that he lesse fered shame Where as yf he had sued for ryches he wolde not so haue done As ye may understande &amp; yf ye regarde his name Ye wyll saye that pure loue was cause of it alone. Dysdayne. Admytte it was for loue yet many are chaungeable Thoughe longe it hath contynued in approued kyndenes Was not Iason to Medea longe agreable Yet after it chaunged he refused her in proces What cruell herte had he whiche for her gentylnes In none other wyse dyd her recompence He regarded neyther kynred nor noblenes This well consydered who wolde to theym gyue credence Pyte. Ye may not blame all thoughe some be chaungeable I can tell you hystoryes of louers ryght stedfast Pyramus and Thysbe contynued very stable As longe as lyfe dyd in theyr bodyes last Whan thone was deed thoder to deth dyd haste Loue surely conioyned is a grete pleasure Than why sholde ye all louers out of fauour cast Syth Thysbe of Pyramus had so grete a treasure Dysdayne. All these hystoryes are not profe suffycyent Syth hystoryes of bothe partes are ryght notable Therfore with these reasons I wyll not be content But I wyll you put a questyon good and reportable Whether loue comynge by effeccyon be more durable Or loue comynge by condicyons heron shall be our argument Me thynke loue comynge by condycyons is lesse varyable How thynke ye now speke shewe your mynde &amp; entent Pyte. Me thynke contrary and for this reason That loue comynge by effeccyon shold endure a lenger space Loue is a conioynynge of two hertes for a season Thoughe perauenture they contynue not long in a place Yet in theyr absence suche loue encreaseth a pace Where as yf it came by condycyons it coude not reuyue But yf so were they myght be in suche case That they myght contynue togyder all theyr lyue. Dysdayne Yes the remembraunce therof remayneth in memory And contynueth longe to theyr grete conforte In what frendely maner and how gentylly His loue to hym dyd at sondry tymes resorte Fyndynge with hym goodly pastymes and dysporte Hauynge no lust frome hym to dysseuer Me thynke of suche as are of this sorte Loue sholde contynue and last for euer. Pyte More surely enprynted is and conioyned stedfastly The loue by effeccyon entreth the herte more depe Than of the other for they rest quyetly Where thoder oftymes breketh many a slepe It is so penytrable and so subtylly doeth crepe Upon a man whiche maketh it so stable Where in thoder yf one suche corne dyd repe He wolde to her be aswell agreable. Dysdayne. Perauenture he thynkes suche condycyons be in none As in his loue so substancyall and stedfast He weneth she be incomperable a lone So that all worldly stormes can not blowe downe his mast Not Eolus yf he came with his moost stormy blast Nor thesyphone coude cause betwene theym dyscorde So durably he trustes that loue wyll last He weneth that Cupyde be so contynuall a lorde Pyte. Consyder the grounde and than it dyscus Where the grounde fayleth can be no suraunce Cessante causa cessat et effectus Take awaye the condycyons where is the remembraunce All is clene gone but where effeccyon doeth enhaunce There is no chaunge but loue perpetuall No dyspleasure can dyspoynt theyr desyred dalyaunce But be entred in the boke of fame to be memoryall Thauctour. Dysdayne to speke was very desyrous Had not credence interrupted his language Whiche made suche haste to her lady amerrous That somthynge she poynted because of her vyage For the whiche she lyke a woman ryght sage Made a pause and spake in wordes compendyous And tellynge she was comen accordynge to her message And in this wyse she spake in wordes effectuous Credence. It pleaseth your grace of your beneuolence To dyrect to me by fantasy your letters myssyue Wherby I consydered and ryght well dyd prepence That I without contradyccyon excuse or stryfe Sholde resorte to your presence syth I durynge my lyue Am bounde to your commaundement yet haue I done offence But I dyd it for this entent elles me from lyfe depryue That me thought it not mete to gyue hasty credence Beaute. I repute no blame in you ye came in good season Ye haue well aspyed your tyme I holde me content Your excuse I allowe it is grounded on reason Here hath ben moche besynes syth ye hens went Now I wyll declare my pleasure syth ye be present As touchynge desyre after whose supplycacyon Betwene Pyte &amp; Dysdayne hath ben a sore argument Tyll ye interrupted theyr communycacyon Pyte and dysdayne gyue ye good audyence And ye desyre take this for an answere Syth now is comyn to me credence I wyll no lenge make delay nor defarre But I commaunde you two to cese your plees and warre And you desyre I wyll to my fauour take Syth me to please aduenture so well ye darre I were to blame yf I sholde you forsake Forther I wyll that ye enioye and procede The moost parte of this gardyn of affeccyon Yf ye lacke ony thynge ye shall haue it at nede And for the tender zele amyte and dyleccyon That I haue to you ye shall haue proteccyon Ouer me and myn durynge my mortall lyfe I wyll moreouer be subdued to your correccyon Yf it lyke you to mary me &amp; haue me to your wyfe Thauctor. O noble wordes ioyous and confortable Prudence propre pastyme pleasure and prouysyon In this good lady were ryght notable From dotage dysdayne daunger and derysyon I wene she was preserued by some vysyon For the whiche desyre of good and herty mynde Spake these wordes without mysprysyon His mynde expressynge by wordes propre and kynde Desyre. O precyous pryncesse of preelecte pulcrytude I can not compasse your compassyble kyndnes Whan it hath pleased your benygnyte &amp; gratytude That I myght entre your gardyn my mynde to expres I am of no suche abylyte as ye make me doubtles But syth ye haue enhabled me of your benygnyte God rewarde you that it hathe pleased you to enhaunce my dygnyte. The eternall god rewarde you accordyngly Yf ony of his powers regarde folkes petyouse Yf Iustyce be in ony place acquyted duely O what worlde brought forth your body delycyouse What parentes gate suche one to be so amerouse Your countenaunce doeth reioyse me &amp; encreseth my myrthe Your vertue proueth your parentage to be of noble byrthe As longe as the flodes renne with water vyolent As longe as shadowes shall about hylles appere And whyle there shall be ony sterres in the fyrmament So longe shall your loue my herte and body stere Your honour and name shall be expressed without fere Syth ye be not varyaunt but stedfast and substancyall Therfore god you acquyte with Ioye perpetuall. Thauctor. This sayd he was auaunced by commaundement of beaute To her owne fete the chayre of preemynence Wheras dysdayne was so enuyouse and angre That she fared as one without intellygence Saynge I wyll nolenger tary I wyll go hens Syth that as soone is auaunced a man of yesterdaye Hauynge no good property as one that without offence Hath contynued from yonge aege in seruyce alway. Than she torned her backe full skornfully And towarde the gates she hyed a hasty pace And from thens she was conueyed by fantasy To that she was clene without the palace Than pyte sayd what sory grace Where is dysdayne is she gone without leue For sothe that were a very heuy case Yet I trust it sholde not many folkes greue. Noyse rumour and fame went shortly all abrode Within the garden that dysdayne was clerely gone Whiche caused many louers that made longe abode To complayne to theyr ladyes they went all alone They fered than nothynge but made theyr mone And sone were sped and went out at the gate Where as afore there coude not haue passed one Fantasy stode alwaye so contynuall thereat. Whiche lyberty encreased amonge them suche Ioyes That me thought I herde the sownynge of many an instrument Whiche grete tryumphe &amp; penytrable noyse Caused Morpheus to vanysshe incontynent Because it was not necessary he sholde be present But auoyde from thens where is noyse and company Whan he was gone I waked and sodaynly dyd sprent So astonyed I knewe not where I was perfytely. Morpheus vanysshed thauctor speketh in ths wyse The daye was comyn and kest a dymme lyght The sonne under clowdes by weder tempestyouse Oryble thonder &amp; lyghtnynge sore troubled my syght And therwith a betynge shour a storme rygorouse Waked me out of slepe it was so Ieoperdouse And where as I wened I had be waked with mynstrelsy It was contrary whiche made my mynde so troublouse That I coude no waye rest neyther syth stande ne lye Than I remembred all my dreme and fantasy Sayenge for the remembraunce of this sodayne chaunge I entende to wryte the maner herof ryght shortly That folkes may consyder this worlde is but straunge Yet to the wyndowe I walked a softe pace Ofte syghynge and sobbynge with an heuy herte To se where I coude espye of pleasure the palace Or of thynhabytauntes therof perceyue ony parte Eyther conforte or kyndenes whiche made me to smerte Fantasy or eloquence whiche dyd desyre forder Pyte with Beaute was whan I dyd thus departe I loked for theyr places where they stode in order Yf I coude se Credence walkynge in ony broder I loked for all these yet I sawe none alas Whiche brought to mynde wordes of salomon of wysdome recorder Vauitas vanitatum &amp; omnia mundi vanitas. Where is Sampson for all his grete strength Or where is the sage Salomon for all his prudence Dethe hath and wyll deuoure all at lenth For where is ulysses for all his eloquence Where became Crassus for his ryches and opulence Where is lucres for all her chastyte Where is alexander whiche subdued to his obedyence Moche of the worlde by his marcyalyte Where is Tully whiche had pryncypalyte Ouer all oratours in parfyte rethoryke Where be all the .iiii. doctours of dyuynyte Where is arystotyll for all his phylosophy and logyke. Be not all these departed frome this transytory lyfe Yet theym to dyuers places our creatour dyd name With egall Iugement without debate or stryfe Accordynge to theyr merytes he dyd rewarde or blame Therfore for your soules helth use vertue &amp; drede shame And as to the worlde laboure alway for loue That ye may perpetually reyne in good fame It shall be to you all ryches aboue As by experyence oftymes it doeth proue Of suche as haue had subgets without loue them to drede From they be of power than they do theyr mynde remoue And so theyr maysters fayle whan they haue nede And ye that wyll be louers of ladyes amyable Ye maye not be sleuthfull but about theym dylygent And alwaye to theyr pleasures ye must be agreable Yf ye intende theyr myndes to content But fyrst fyxe your mynde there as it may be well spent Be secrete and stedfast without mutabylyte Be bolde and couragyous fulfyll theyr commaundement With a quycke and hasty spede as ye by possybylyte May or can nothynge is better than agylyte With contynuall presence nothynge can helpe more For Ouyde sayth els your loue shall not rest in tranquylyte Vanescetque absens et nouus intrat amor. These reasons reuolued in my remembraunce Whan that sorowe was somthynge modefyed Than grete trouble my mynde dyde enhaunce What sholde be cause that I had be occupyed With this dreme yet shortly I aspyed That this amerous study of Cupyde and Phebus Was cause therof whiche coude not be denyed Therfore in mynde I dyd playnly duscus That I wolde study nomore and specyally thus I wolde muse no more in the euenynge so late But conclude this shortly in wordes compendyous Lest I sholde be as I was erste in myserable estate Volunte ie ay mais ie ne veulx mon cuer chaunger.
