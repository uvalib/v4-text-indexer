      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY STANZAS. “If my slight muse do please these curious days, The pain be mine, but thine be all the praise.” Shakespeare, Sonnet 38. I Art thou still absent?—Then, a strange bright dream Bore thee unto me in its shadowy arms.— Ah! come again,—so like a pleasant gleam Of light, that I (free from unjust alarms) May gaze on my illuminated theme, And read thy varying smiles and many charms, And swear by the great Love to love thee long, Beyond ambition, or the light of song. II Come!—I will crown thee with the fairest flowers That ever sprang beneath the eyes of May, When Flora and the wind (young paramours) Were whispering caught in woods at dawn of day, And those that blossom quick in April showers, Or when the Autumn rivers run astray:— All flowers thou shalt have which perfume yield, From fountain, lake, or forest,—garden,—field. III And first of all the rose; because its breath Is rich beyond the rest, and when it dies It doth bequeath a charm to sweeten death, And violets whose looks are like the skies, And that sad flow'r for which, as story saith, Echo the nymph once pined, until her sighs Allured some god to charm her into stone, And snow-drops winter-born, pining alone. IV And Hyacinth whom Zephyr's jealous wing Slew, and Apollo changed to some soft star: The lily, of all children of the spring The palest,—fairest too where fair ones are; And woodbines which like fondest lovers cling Round trees that spread their sheltering arms afar; And flow'rs that turn to meet the sun-light clear, And those which slumber when the night is near. V These and all others:—whatsoe'er is best Beloved by thee shall I refuse to claim? The sweetest shall between thy palms be prest; The nameless—thou shalt kiss and give them name; The whitest on thy bosom white shall rest,— Alas! not so, for then they lose their fame: Not so; but rather shall each flower be Rank'd and high-honour'd as it aideth thee. VI Sweet friend! my soul is haunted by a vow To dedicate (frail work!) this book to thee: With all its weakness—all its errors, thou Wilt prize the wandering verse that comes from me, Past its poor merit; and perhaps thy brow— Lovely beyond that old idolatry, Which grew to life from marble, (so decreed Venus) may lose a care as thou shalt read. VII And yet thine eye, so summer-bright at times, When sorrow is not (wherefore ever?) there, May melancholy wane before my rhymes, And thy young heart may tremble in its lair, And sigh for her, that girl of southern climes, Who died because she loved a vision rare: Pale heathen! languishing like one whose brain Is sun-stricken on some unshelter'd plain. VIII —Said I not, maiden mine, that I would swear Before bright Love, the God, to love thee long? Oh! yes, and to the world proclaim how fair, How very fair thou art, even among Beauties who beautiful accounted are. This duty to thy poet doth belong: Therefore I swear to thee, by the sweet pain Of love, to love thee ever,—though in vain. IX I swear to thee by all who have famous been! By lovers who have died to live in song! By Ariadne pining near the green Ocean, while Theseus' vessel skimm'd along! By Dido left forlorn,—sad Carthage queen, Who ended on the pile Love's bitter wrong! By Phaon's lover plunging from the steep! By pale Laodamia doomed to weep!— X By all who reach'd in life a happier fate Thro' Love's dim mystic mazes! By that day When Peleus wedded Thetis in such state! And by those balmy nights when Cupid lay By Psyche,—tho' at last he lingered late, And she beheld, and so he fled away. By all the moonlight hours when Dian lone Drank in the breathings of Endymion! XI By this—by all—by every other tale Fabled or true, happy or dark with woe; By that, which e'er it is, that doth prevail Over the rest: and by twin hearts that know Themselves so well that nought can e'er avail To kill their faith or lay sweet passion low; (Yet lovers' hearts should armed be alway, Lest Love, when doubt is born, chance to decay.) XII —Yet wherefore thus? Ah! wherefore not have sworn At once by thy fair self,—thy spotless truth, By thy quick sense of all that can adorn Woman, thy modest pride, thy words that soothe A brightness into beauty like the morn, Which else might dim thy clear and gentle youth, Or make the world forget that thou wert young— Why by thyself have I not said or sung?— XIII I know not:—How I write or how have writ The muse, who mistress is, alone can tell: Bright causer of the poet's pleasant fit, Who when she well is cherish'd, rhymeth well; A fair ally of thy most playful wit Is she, and my true passion. Who may tell But we may live, all three, familiar friends, As one dull colour with two brighter blends! XIV Perhaps together we may journey soon (Her wings are sinewy-strong and fit to bear) Where once Astolpho went, and meet the moon Tracking her desert—the blue boundless air, Like thing half lost. 'Tis now but early June, And time there is while days are long and fair To taste the sights bards say are something worth:— And who will miss us, sweet, from this dull earth? XV None, none:—Our course—my course, at least, has been Humble and sad from my most childish time: Tho' thou indeed hast plucked some pleasures green, The offspring of a near, less-cloudy clime: More likely then to judge, from what thou'st seen, Of things which hitherto have dwelt in rhyme; So shalt thou master, I the pupil be, When we set sail to reach the lunar sea. XVI Perhaps we there may find bright creatures straying, Whose light would perish in this clouded world,— Like her who went thro' Athens' woods a-straying By night, but slept by day in cowslips curl'd; Or Ariel, haunting sprite, who wept obeying The frown of Prosper, and his blue wings furled In sorrow when he met his master's scorn: That peerless spirit,—so true, tho' beauty-born. XVII —Here rest I.—Sickness like a film hath spread Over mine eye and dimmed its little light, Since what is writ was writ—(not fable-bred, But such as truest poets love to write)— And now methinks I commerce with the dead, And face the shadowy angel in his might. —'Tis gone; and melancholy dreams and pain And scorn of all I do alone remain. XVIII And Fame doth seem a bubble that may burst, Pierced by an ignorant pen or selfish hate; And Fortune like a vision vainly nursed, Whose golden strength a breath may dissipate; And Love—yet am I not so sickness-cursed As rail against the bounty of my fate. What I may never look on let me scorn; But thou art to me like the risen morn. XIX Thou livest in my heart, thro' distance—time, 'Midst fickle friendships and fantastic joys, Alone a truth:—Like Love, which is sublime, Thy sweet smile elevates and never cloys; And thou art all the beauty of this rhyme, The brightness, and the spirit that now buoys A verse which else would fall.—O lady mine! Gaze on it till it grows like thee,—divine. THE FLOOD OF THESSALY. PART THE FIRST. — Genus mortale sub undis Perdere, et ex omni nimbos dimittere cœlo. Ovid. Metam. In Thessaly, while yet the world was young,— Soon after Chaos, touched with light and form, Lost its vague being, and sprung up alarm'd To beautiful order,—in the pleasant vale Of Tempé, where the meadows still are green, The waters bright, the forests flourishing, Lived Pyrrha and the young Deucalion. —She was Pandora's child, who in gone days Had for her dowry that most deadly gift Which filled the world with pain: His sire was called Prometheus, the great Titan, who lay stretch'd Huge as a mammoth on the barren edge Of Caucasus, where day by day, earth-lured, Jove's bird, the ravenous vulture, like a cloud Came sailing by the sun to feast on blood. He was the Titan's son; yet did he bow To Themis and before great Jove who reigned Supreme upon the hills Olympian: First God and reigning spirit was he who hurled The scythed Saturn from his ancient throne, And cast him with an arm unfilial Headlong from out the skies, to walk the earth Undeified, where as a man he taught The Latian people many an useful art, And shed the golden time o'er Italy. Pyrrha and young Deucalion!—fair names As ever shone in fable or old song, Tradition or recording history: In green youth were they lovers, tho' scarce known The bud which after blossom'd into love; Still lovers, tho' now wedded with consent Of their own gentle hearts, before the face Of all the stars that crowd the summer sky. How beautiful they were may not be told; Yet both were beautiful, and one so fair That when her glossy ringlets downwards fell, Serpenting o'er her shoulders smooth and white As marble, (such the Parians wrought) she seemed A happy Dryad from the woods escaped, Or Naiad who had left her watery cave Content to dwell with man:—Deucalion trod The green earth as the feathered herald trod, (Jove's son and starry Maia's,—always young) And round about his temples the black curls Hung thick, and clustering left his forehead bare. His eye was like the eagle's, wild and keen, And his mouth parted but to speak of love: Not huge, yet giant-sprung, his towering youth Rose into manhood, like a Titan born. Careless of all the world save one sweet care, And in each other lost they dreamt away The hours, well pleased on fragrant lawns to stray In balmy autumn, or thro' summer groves, Or beside fountains where the noonday heat Came never; gentlest Pyrrha silent then, And listening to her lover's voice so low, Which, while it languish'd or spoke soft reproach, Hung like sweet music in her charmed ear. At last they wed: No voice of parent spoke Ungentle words which now too often mar Life's first fair passion: then no gods of gold Usurping swayed with bitter tyranny That sad domain the heart. Love's rule was free, (Ranging through boundless air and happy heaven, And earth) when Pyrrha wed the Titan's son. —The winds sang at their nuptial gentle tunes, And roses opened, on whose crimson hearts The colour of love is stamped; and odours rare Came steaming from the morn-awakening flow'rs, Which then forgot to close: Thessalian pipes Were heard in vallies, and from thickets green The Sylvans peeped delighted, then drew back And shouted thro' the glades: Wood nymphs lay then Beside the banks of running rivers, glad For once to hear the shepherd's simple song; And many a pleasant strife that night was had On oaten reed and pastoral instrument, Beneath the mild eye of the quiet moon. “Joy to Pandora's child! Supreme delight To the great Titan's son!”—all shouted forth. “Joy!” and the words went through the far vales sounding, And thro' the forests tall, and over hills And dells, where slumberous melancholy streams Awoke and gave an echo. In dark woods The wild horse started from his midnight sleep, And shook his mane and shrilly spoke aloud. The Nightingale lay silent in the leaves, For joy was grief to her: the timorous sheep Were silent; and the backward-glancing hare Lay close, and scarce the wild deer stirred the fern. O happy amorous hours! O gentlest night! When Pleasure left her home with winged Love:— How often was that night in after times Brought back! How often looks all light went forth, And kisses pressed on lips glistening with dew, And words more soft than zephyr ever breathed In May, and sighs more soft than any word. On the swift pinions of untired delight Passed the bright year; and one fair infant, while On the young mother's swelling breast it lay,— Lay like a sleeping flower, blooming lone In beauty, with no sweet companion nigh, Drew heart to heart, and with unconscious power Breathed pleasures new, pure, and ineffable. —A lovely sight it was, when from his toil Returning, or grave thought, or mountain sport, Deucalion reached his home. By the rude door Grew sycamore and limes whose branches hung Like amorous tresses, and around whose trunks The honey-suckle wound its fragrant arms; And laurels always green and myrtle-flowers Were there, which shook their white buds to the moon, And there, long waiting his return, was she, The gentlest Pyrrha, who each happy day Gathered her fairest fruits to welcome him. Thus did the God-descended Titan dwell Thro' hours and months of joy; Pyrrha the while, Meek handmaid, happy mother, fondest wife And faithful, to her most harmonious thoughts Gave voice, and uttered music to the morn; And told how grateful was she to the skies, To silence, and the air, which on its wings Carried her sweet thanks past the farthest tops Of Pelion, and grey Ossa, and beyond Lone Athos, thro' the golden gates of Jove,— Where on imperial cloud he singly sits, Pavilioned by the rainbows, but uncrowned Save by his hyacinthine locks which hang Down like a cloud, and cast for ever out Quick splendours, fiercer than are seen at noon When bright Apollo wears his Syrian rays. There sits he in his state, and there around Stand all the Olympian gods and shapes, save one, Juno his Queen, who near his feet reclines. —From that high station Jove doth watch the world: Its happiness and woe; its good and evil; Its many hopes, and dumb unspoken doubts, And the first births of error; lonely pain; Madness, and mirth, and heart-corroding care; And fears which plough the forehead with deep lines, Like wisdom; and electric thought that springs Like lightning from the inspired poet's brain. Thus, bound in amorous chains, the lovers lived.— Meantime, in Thessaly the times were rank: Men grew degenerate; women sank abased; And childhood lost its smile, and age its claim To honour. Jove upon his skiey throne Heard now no incense rise, no prayer, no thanks; But, in their stead, commotions that shook towns, Curses and vain defiance laughing loud: And black abominations and foul thoughts Were bred and nourished, till the heart became Spotted as with a plague.— Then Falsehood first was known, lean Avarice, Hate, Hot Vengeance, and the virgin's ravishment, Cunning, and Theft; and Murder stalked abroad, Till sleep forsook the night and Fear was born.— Such sin was never done nor stain beheld Thro' wide creation since the world began, Save when Jehovah shot his fiery rain Down on Gomorrah, and that city razed And ruined, and its tenants all destroyed. Jove saw the sin, and o'er his forehead large (Whereon, as on a map, the world is seen) There passed the shadow of a storm.—‘Behold!’ He said; and as he spoke the vassal skies Trembled, and white Olympus to its heart Sickened and shook: then, stretching wide abroad His sceptre which doth compass land and sea, He pointed towards the ocean caverns, where Upon his coral bed the sea-god lay Reposing:—thro' the hollows of the deep Where tempests come not, and thro' all the caves Of that green world and watery palaces, The word resounded:—from his bed uprose The brother of Jove, and with a sign replied. Then in a moment from their quartered homes The winds came muttering,—West and blighting East, And South; while Boreas prison-doomed and mad Flew to the North, and shivering branch and trunk Lifted the billows till their curling heads Struck the pale stars.—At last the wet South hung Brooding alone, down-weighed by cloud and shower, And bound in black, mourning the coming doom, And with his raven wings and misty breath Allured the storms. Wide-stretching clouds around (A dark confederacy) in silence met, Hiding all Heaven. Towards the glooming shore The tempest sailed direct, and on the top Of Pelion burst and swept away its pines By thousands:—Where it burst a way was made Like that torn by the avalanche, when it falls Louder than crashing thunder, amidst smoke And ruin, bounding from the topmost Alps O'er chasm and hill, and strips the forests bare. Oh! woe, deep woe to fruitful Thessaly! That tempest-shock sounded all o'er the land, And men left their low dwellings, and came forth And saw the sheeted cataracts gush from Heaven, Like rivers that had burst their bonds, and fall Darkening the day, until those ceaseless floods Drowned and destroyed the herbs and bended corn, Flowers and fruits, the wealth of all the year.— For a time the earth drank in the mighty rains; For a time,—but sated soon, morasses shone Where plains had stretched, and ripling rivers left Their channels old and wandered far away. Upon a hilly slope lay Pyrrha's home Still safe from the rising waters; yet she feared. “Deucalion!”—(on their mossy bed they lay, And heard without the hissing rain descend.) “Deucalion! Ah! I fear, Deucalion, The gods are angered; not with thee, dear friend, For, tho' the Titan's son, thy vows have been Constant, thine actions holy. Unto Jove And Themis have we bowed and prayed—in vain: For lo! the storms are out, and Heaven is dark Perpetually. Apollo now no more Rises at morning nor at evening fades; And Dian, who when the year was wasting looked But pale amidst the fighting elements, Hath vanish'd quite: the stars are gone; the day Hath died:—the earth itself passeth away.”— Thus spoke that gentle woman and lay still, Weeping and full of fears: Deucalion took Her nearer to his heart:—“Themis is just,” Sighing he said, “and kind, and tho' a frown Hath hung upon the forehead of great Jove Awhile, yet clearer light will come at last, And he will smile and we rejoice again. Believe it, love: and know, a dream—a thought How thou may'st yet be saved hath come to me, And I will labour long and shape a raft Wherein upon the rough wave thou shalt pass To happier shores, sweet Pyrrha.”—Still she sighed, While he, still soothing, from her forehead pale Parted the dark brown hair, and pressed thereon His lips in silence. Thus, heart-folded close She wept away her fears, and slumber fell Like snow-down on her:—Quietly she slept Without a dream until the morning came. Morn came: but that broad light which hung so long In heaven forsook the showering firmament.— The clouds went floating on their fatal way. Rivers had grown to seas: the great sea swol'n Too mighty for his bound broke on the land, Roaring and rushing, and each flat and plain Devoured.—Upon the mountains now were seen Gaunt men, and women hungering with their babes, Eying each other, or with marble looks Measuring the space beneath swift-lessening. At times a swimmer from some distant rock Less high, came struggling with the waves, but sank Back from the slippery soil. Pale mothers then Wept without hope, and aged heads struck cold By agues trembled like red autumn leaves; And infants moaned and young boys shrieked with fear. Stout men grew white with famine. Beautiful girls Whom once the day languished to look on, lay On the wet earth and wrung their drenched hair; And fathers saw them there, dying, and stole Their scanty fare, and while they perished thrived. Then Terror died, and Grief, and proud Despair, Rage and Remorse, infinite Agony, Love in its thousand shapes, weak and sublime, Birth-strangled; and strong Passion perished. The young, the old, weak, wise, the bad, the good Fell on their faces, struck,—whilst over them Washed the wild waters in their clamorous march. Still fell the flooding rains. Great Ossa stood Lone, like a peering Alp, when vapours shroud Its sides, unshaken in the restless waves; But from the weltering deeps Pelion arose And shook his piny forehead at the clouds, Moaning, and crown'd Olympus all his snows Lost from his hundred heads, and shrank aghast. Day, Eve, Night, Morning came and passed away. No Sun was known to rise and none to set: 'Stead of its glorious beams a sickly light Paled the broad East what time the day is born: At others a thick mass vaporous and black, And firm like solid marble, roofed the sky; Yet gave no shelter. —Still the ravenous wolf Howled, and wild foxes and the household dog Grown wild, upon the mountains fought and fed Each on the other. The great Eagle still In his home brooded, inaccessible, Or, when the gloomy morning seemed to break, Floated in silence o'er the shoreless seas. Still the quick snake unclasped its glittering eyes, Or shivering hung about the roots of pines; And still all round the vultures flew, and watched The tumbling waters thick with bird and beast; Or, dashing in the midst their ravenous beaks, Plundered the screaming billows of their dead. Ne'er has such ruin been or such despair Since, in records or tales of Thessaly. Earth shook, great Mother, and from all her limbs Sent signs of terror and unnatural pain: The vallies trembled, and great lakes unlocked Their dark foundations, and laid bare to day Naiads with watery locks and elfish shapes, Half sylvan, such as loved of old to haunt On the fresh edge of forest-girded pools, And shook the gladed echoes with their laugh. Whole plains heaved up: meadows were torn and turn'd Downwards, and ancient oaks whose crooked feet Were riveted in rocks were wrenched away And bared to the wild blast and sullen rain. Wonder grew plain as truth. Etna, far off— Terrible Etna, spuming, cast abroad Her blazing rivers with loud groaning sounds That tore the amazed heart of Sicily:— Such noise was never bred on the great shores Where Orinoco, huge sea-creature, comes Rolling his shining train, o'er rapids and gulphs Descending swift, and for a thousand leagues Ravages wood and wild, and mad at last Dashes his watery scorn against the breast That fed him:—She, fond ocean-mother, still Receives him to deep calm within her arms. Higher and higher fled the wasted throngs, And still they hoped for life, and still they died, One after one, some worn, some hunger-mad: Here lay a giant's limbs sodden and shrunk, And there an infant's, white like wax, and close A matron with grey hairs, all dumb and dead:— Meanwhile, upon the loftiest summit safe, Deucalion laboured through the dusky day, Completing as he might his floating raft, And Pyrrha, sheltered in a cave, bewailed Her child which perished.— Still the ruin fell: No pity, no relapse, no hope:—The world Was vanishing like a dream. Lightning and Storm, Thunder and deluging rain now vexed the air To madness, and the riotous winds laughed out Like Bacchanals, whose cups some God has charmed. Beneath the headlong torrents towns and towers Fell down, temples all stone, and brazen shrines; And piles of marble, palace and pyramid (Kings' homes or towering graves) in a breath were swept Crumbling away. Masses of ground and trees Uptorn and floating, hollow rocks brute-crammed, Vast herds, and bleating flocks, reptiles, and beasts Bellowing, and vainly with the choaking waves Struggling, were hurried out,—but none returned: All on the altar of the giant Sea Offered, like twice ten thousand hecatombs, Whose blood allays the burning wrath of Gods. —Day after day the busy Death passed on Full, and by night returned hungering anew; And still the new morn filled his horrid maw, With flocks, and herds, a city, a tribe, a town, One after one borne out, and far from land Dying in whirlpools or the sullen deeps. All perished then:—The last who lived was one Who clung to life because a frail child lay Upon her heart: weary, and gaunt, and worn, From point to point she sped, with mangled feet, Bearing for aye her little load of love:— Both died,—last martyrs of another's sins, Last children they of Earth's sad family. Still fell the flooding rains. Still the Earth shrank: And Ruin held his strait terrific way. Fierce lightnings burnt the sky, and the loud thunder (Beast of the fiery air) howled from his cloud, Exulting, towards the storm-eclipsed moon. Below, the Ocean rose boiling and black, And flung its monstrous billows far and wide Crumbling the mountain joints and summit hills; Then its dark throat it bared and rocky tusks, Where, with enormous waves on their broad backs, The demons of the deep were raging loud; And racked to hideous mirth or bitter scorn Hissed the Sea-angels; and earth-buried broods Of Giants in their chains tossed to and fro, And the sea-lion and the whale were swung Like atoms round and round.— Mankind was dead: And birds whose active wings once cut the air, And beasts that spurned the waters,—all were dead: And every reptile of the woods had died Which crawled or stung, and every curling worm:— The untamed tiger in his den, the mole In his dark home—were choaked: the darting ounce, And the blind adder and the stork fell down Dead, and the stifled mammoth, a vast bulk, Was washed far out amongst the populous foam: And there the serpent, which few hours ago Could crack the panther in his scaly arms, Lay lifeless, like a weed, beside his prey. And now, all o'er the deeps corpses were strewn, Wide-floating millions, like the rubbish flung Forth when a plague prevails; the rest down-sucked, Sank, buried in the world-destroying seas.— Confusion raged and ruled. At last, up-grew A mingling of Earth, Sea, and Heaven and Air; All one they looked, impenetrable, black As Chaos, when the salient atoms flew Around the abyss and made all space a Hell. Nature lay drowned and dead. Fens, moors, and bogs, And pleasant vallies and aspiring hills, Rivers and trees were lost, mountains and lakes: Even Heaven eternal, whom no cloud before Utterly barred, thro' its serene domain Kept captive all the Gods and lucid stars, Mercurius and Apollo and the rest; And hid their beauty from the fainting world. —A mass like the great ocean when all winds Blow and lay bare its hollows, and shake forth The century-sleeping sands, until the foam Grows thick and dark, rolled over sea and land,— A perilous mass of floods, fierce as the North In March, when scything blasts strip all the bones, And loud as when the riven air proclaims Earthquakes at Hecla, or once bright Peru. —It is a task beyond the Muse,—and yet Sometimes she writeth with a golden pen,— Witness those tales breathing of Paradise And all that sinful mirth of Circe's son, And where the mightiest poet open lays Red Pandæmonium to eternal view, And numbereth out the Peers of Satan, all Tossed on the fiery waters, and bewailing Their frightful fall; from Heaven's precipitous bounds Cast like the refuse, to find out their way Thro' depths and dark abysses, and the jar Earlier than Order, till the mouths of Hell Received them flaming,—a tremendous home. It is a task beyond the Muse, too far, To paint that leaden darkness which obscured The world, or that wide horror which was born When every element forsook its name And nature, and all dumb and innocent things Perished, because imperial man had erred.— A dreariness there is which chills the heart, When the sun dies on some ice-barren plain, Cheerless and wintry-pale; and when the wind Waileth in loud December, calling ghosts To feed the sight of credulous age; and when The hail-storm comes; and when the great sea chafes, And the wild horses of the Atlantic shake Their sounding manes and dash the foam to Heaven. These sights are vanquished by the painter's toil: But when the intolerable flood prevailed,— That watery massacre, which quite destroyed Thessaly, man and woman, and children frail, Birds, beasts, the very worm, the tree, the flower, When nothing was—but ruin, and nought seen But one monotonous dreary waste of waves Tumbling in monstrous eddies, and a light Like an eclipse complete when day is hid, The painter's pencil and the poet's pen Must fail, confounded at a scene so dire.— On a drear morning, ague-cold and dark, Deucalion from the mountain's lonely top Launched his frail raft, rich with its living freight And laden full: Scarce light enough was seen To show that quarter of the sky 'neath which The green Parnassus (when that mount was green) Held station; yet with hands which trembled not He struck his piny oar against the soil And floated on the waters.— —So he left The failing land, and then loud gusts uprose Curling the billows with unnatural rage, Till on the summit of the desert hill They rushed, and in the Titan's sight tore up The knarled oaks, washing and wasting all The ruinous earth until no trace was seen. “Whither, ah! whither—to what happier shore Steer'st thou thy way, Deucalion?” Pyrrha spoke. He, glancing at the sky, just where the North Is cut by the eastern light at early dawn, (The mid-point of the compass) bade her gaze: “What see'st thou—nought?—Poor girl, thine eye is dim: For hope still lives.—Come! Bride of my despair, (Now of my hope,) we'll live or die together. Along the desarts of the deep we'll go, Along the wide and wave-blown wilderness, Undaunted and untiring. Some fair land There is which Jove designs shall be our home: Believe it. O Thessalian Pyrrha!—Thou, Child of the ocean, canst thou fear its rage?”— So spoke he, smiling thro' deep sorrow,—filled With fear which yet he kept hid in his heart; And with prevailing looks and voice all love Cheered the sad Pyrrha on her watery way. —Morn passed, and noon, and eve along; and night Over their heads hung like a pall, through which No minute star nor glimpse of faintest light Could pierce; but all was dark,—dark like the grave. —And so they floated on their fated track, Borne onwards till the o'erwhelming rains had ceased, And the wild winds were sleeping: and around No noise was heard, save from their beating hearts, And the lone dashings of the endless seas. PART THE SECOND. Some have believed the Deluge never was: And some that, ere it was, man walked the world With a sight more near to immortality, Than e'er hath shone since those diluvian days: Others have guessed that monstrous tribes, now dead, Blackened the air, once, or with ponderous bulks Trod down the soil,—Phœnix and eastern Roc, And Sphinx whose words perplex'd the wit of Thebes, And Behemoth, vast birth, (almost a fable) That fed like Famine on the streams and hills,— A breathing wonder,—a strange truth, confirmed. —To me the records of the days of old Are starred with a diviner character. Fable, historian page, or sager verse I mar not nor reject; nor now enquire, Bent on a tale of ancient years, how far The wonders of past times be false or true. Whether the bright and rolling world came forth, A thing of life, from Darkness or blind Chance, Chaos or utter Nought; or sprung from Air, Fire or innumerable atoms, charmed Into harmonious motion, or dependeth On star or comet, is not now my care: Nor whether in the earth's deep heart there hides A mighty abyss of waters, casting out From immemorial time, beautiful things In its revolving. 'Tis enough for me To gaze on its great regions,—boundless plains, Continents, flourishing isles, and desarts rude, Forests old as the world and falling floods, And mountains, east and west, which kiss the moon, Andes, and Himalayans, and bright Alps; And fiery Etna in her purple pride Rising from meadows of a thousand hues. Nor these alone transport me; gentler sights Are mine, deep groves and fountains and calm lakes, And murmuring waters and lone silent shores, The air, the golden sun, the visiting cloud Which comes and goes; Night and her crowds of stars And that ne'er-sleeping wilderness of waves The sea,—the populous sea, which circleth all, And the wide arch of everlasting Heaven. Free Nature in her bounty offereth these To man, and hence I worship. I may dream That the great earth unshapen, was indeed First, co-eternal with the supreme God; Thus Plato taught: or by a single word (Born like a thought, and smit with light and sound At once) was called to wear this perfect form, This dress of bluest air and sylvan shade: Or with thy fables, old Pythagoras, (Gathered in sandy Egypt, or derived From bearded Magi in the Chaldee lands) Cheat for awhile my soul:—But Truth will come, And cloudless seasons and serener hours, And then how vain it is I learn, to send Among earth's secrets and confusions, forth A thought unwing'd, to search and ask what was The dread Beginning! Like a pilgrim worn By toil and blinded on the burning sands, The baffled Speculation home returns, Drooping and glad to rest. Therefore no more: O Muse! no longer loiter in thy way; For thou, ere thou hast done thy toil, must scale The empyrean with undrooping wings, And look upon the bright haunts of the Gods. High in that middle region, where, it seems, Olympus and his hundred heads are lost In air—(tho' clouds hang round and make the place Holy, cerulean vapours rare and fine,) 'Tis storied Jove's Saturnian palace sprung. —It was a mighty dome, whose blue arch shone With a thousand constellated lights that rained Rich, endless day, and gentlest warmth like spring The present and the past were there,—the Signs Scorpion and Cancer and Aquarius, And all who belt the sky, and all the throng That flame along the tropics, or like gems Live in the foreheads of the hemispheres, Sirius and Taurus and the starry twain, (Leda's) and fierce Orion who, between Phœnix and Hydra, on the nights of May Shakes over southern seas his watery beams; And northwards shone Canopus, and the lights Cassiopeia, and the great fix'd star Arcturus, and Andromeda, long chained And haunted on the cold and sea-beat rock Others were there, since known. Below, withdrawn, And seen as thro' a vista clear and wide, Gleam'd squares and arches, streets, range after range, Temples and towers and alabaster spires, Which ran up to infinitude, and pierced With sharp and glittering points the highest air, And terraces crown'd with pavilions, which Outshone the sun, and with their light made base All that of old Nebuchadnezzar hung Towering above his Babylonian halls, Making great wonder dumb. Nearer, all round That lustrous dome colossal figures stood, Like pillars, with vast sinewy arms outspread, And golden shapes between, with finer care Wrought than e'er Phidias us'd, whose carved thoughts Threw beauty o'er the years of Pericles. Typhon was there—(his spirit, the corpor'al mould Lay under Etna, crush'd,) and Atlas huge, Phorcys, and Briareus, tho' spared from toil, And prone Enceladus, whom Pluto trod Down with his chariot wheels, when thro' the heart Of groaning earth he wound his dusky way, Jamque per anfractus animarum rector opacos Sub terris querebat iter, gravibusque gementem Enceladum calcabat equis.—Claud. De raptu Proserpin. And raped Proserpina: and all the rest, Titans, and giants, and amphibious things, Whose hate grew strong when Saturn ceased his reign. Fixed on their pedestals of glowing gold (Figured with all the actions of the sky) They stood,—proud perfect works, and thro' their veins Transparent the ethereal fluids ran: While in each space curtains of trembling mist And azure-woven air came flowing down, O'er-shower'd with stars,—between whose waving folds The delicate Zephyrs with their odorous loads Passed in and out, and girls, like Flora fair, Sprinkled the veined floor with amaranth blooms. —And there the laughing Hours flew round and round In airy circles, while outspread below The wood-nymphs lay and Fauns, whose haunts were now Flooded, and at their head the sylvan Pan, Married to Echo, who received his words As wisdom, and to all the listening Earth Told the deep secrets of his springs and caves. “Echo, the wife of Pan, is no other than genuine Philosophy which faithfully repeats his word, or only transcribes as Nature dictates, thus representing the true image and reflection of the world.”—Lord Bacon, on Learning. And Jupiter, eternal Spirit, was there, Like a Divinity beyond the rest Enthroned:—Apart, and as imperial kings Sit reigning compassed by their pomp and arms, So, amid clouds and amethystine fires, He ruled; not fierce as when thro' heaven he chased Saturn, but milder than the first born Love. And near him stood Apollo,—Cybele, Juno, and zoned Aphrodité crown'd With flowering myrtles, and the palest maid Of heaven,—Diana; and bright numbers more. Suddenly—(for till then whispers had been, And smiles prevailing and melodious tones, And Eolus in distance far was heard Sounding his trumpet over lands and seas) Silence came forth:—The circling Hours then ceased Their round, and from Jove's throne a silver light Flowed to the zenith, mild as what is seen At morning, when the westering stars are gone, And young Apollo still delays the day. Every bright eye was filled, and quickly turned Its radiance towards the supreme king, who raised His head and shook his cloudy hair aside, Smiling in beauty throughout heaven.—'Twas then The Gods rejoiced, and knew the world was saved. The world is saved,—Millions of spirits sang All around the skiey halls—The World is saved; From Deluge; from the immeasureable wrath Of Jove; from Desolation; from Decay! They sang, and all the murmuring Zephyrs shook From off their wings harmonious airs, and sounds Came streaming from immortal instruments, All heaven attun'd, and as by Muses' hands Touched in diviner moments, when the choir Of Phœbus, from long listening to his lyre, Are equalled for a space with mightiest Gods. Even he himself, the Lord of light and song, For once descending from his sublime state, Swept in the madness of the hour, such chords As stung to ravishment and finer joy Gods, and all else:—The constellations flashed And trembled: the fierce Giants lost their frown; And the Fauns shrieked, while thro' Olympian veins Like light, the quick nectarean spirit flew, Till each stood forth betrayed—a brighter God, Startled at his full-shewn Divinity. The World is saved; from Deluge; from Decay! Still sounded thro' the vast Saturnian halls, Like echoes which the mountains multiply From rock to rock, sending their cries abroad O'er barren moors and the dumb solitudes, And thro' the watery dells and hollow caves, Which, shaking off the ancient silence, give Great answer, in their own fantastic voice Familiar to the listening air alone. Still the words sounded: Still ‘The World is saved!’ Rang all around; but as the echoes died, Fainter,—and fainter still with every cry, The vision of the Gods which lately filled The circuit of Olympus with its light, Receded:—The great Juno shrank, eclipsed, And Venus lost her smile, and Dian waned: Ceres had fled, and Mars; and Phœbus now Shook softer lustre from his dewy hair; And Jupiter, the greatest and the last Of all to lose his brightness, in a cloud Shrouded the light of his Elysian eyes, And seemed to fade away. One after one Departed:—Whither? Oh! enquire no more; No more the Muse may tell who saw that sight Thousands of years ago. Whether there be An inner conclave or diviner seat Removed, or if the embracing elements Then each received its own peculiar God, Who lost his incarnation, or put off A shape which was his limit,—ask no more. All that is told is this—They vanished,—all, Statues and pillars and cerulean domes Vanished, and lustrous stars and crowned Gods, And Giants shrank to dissolution, like The watery pageant which the morning sun Breeds on Sicilian shores, and buildeth up Tow'r and vain column and Palladian arch, And capital, upon the alarmed floods: Or such as travellers note at break of day On Pambamarca, where the shapes of men Stand forth like ghosts, and vanish. So the Gods, Great visions! through the wide empyrean fled, And faded,—wasting all to azure air. Yet, ere they vanished, two bright creatures left The skies, commissioned to declare by signs The will of Jove to man,—wingfooted, light, And young, Caducean Mercury, who like A diver plunging from some rocky height, Flung himself headlong from the chrystal walls Of Heaven, and thro' the airy wilderness Shot like a star; and with him streaming went Iris, arrayed in all her many hues, With power to spread or hide her coloured wings, And amid sunshine or in rain throw out Her storm-dissolving bow, and check the floods. Over the water-covered hills they flew, Which once looked fair in Greece,—over the tops Of Athos and the mountain-peaks that stand Close by the Bosphorus, whose quickening stream Was drowned and lost, and he no longer rushed Forth as of old, to clasp his shrinking bride, The pale Propontic, in his foaming arms. All was wide waste and water. Far and near The skiey twain (like as two planets spin Round in their orbits, yet with gentler speed) Circled, and still descended, and delayed, Hovering attentive as each floating wreck Passed onwards, by the currents charmed along: At last, not far from where Parnassus lies, They saw, contending with the awaken'd wind, And tossed, and worn, and struggling with the streams, A little raft, whereon two creatures lay, Wreck of the world. The man, with haggard eyes And sinews loosen'd by unnatural toil, Strove yet to cherish his companion pale, And with high tender courage, such as springs From fountains only where the heart is pure, Soothed her and spoke, and with his arm around Her fainting figure, seemed to ward away Evils, both watery perils and despair. “Art thou so weary, Pyrrha?” in soft voice Deucalion spake—“so weary, so forlorn?” “Pity me, my sweet husband; thou art brave, But I am weaker than an infant's sigh. “But I am weaker than a woman's tear.”—Tro. and Cressid. Oh! I have weighed thee down: Alone thou might'st Have held great war with Fate; but I have been Thy ruin.”—“Dear perdition!” he returned, “Not golden Fortune on her turning wheel Was so to be desired as thou by me: Oh! thou art fairer than all fortune.—Love! Pyrrha! Thou tenderest creature ever born, Cheer thee:—Behold, day breaks at last, and hark! How all the music of the morning comes.” He spoke and smiled,—When, like a curtain torn Suddenly from the East, the parted glooms Withdrew, South, West and to the howling North:— Thus dæmons driven from some holy shrine, By incantations, or a God's bright frown, Forsake the temple, and with desperate shrieks Cast them upon the wild and boundless winds. The storm grew silent; and the thunder spake No more; but in their place visions arose, Meteors and floating lights and glancing stars, And splendours running to and fro, amidst Heaps of dissolving cloud, trembling, confus'd. But joy is slow-believed, where grief hath lived Long a familiar: so despair still sate And sorrow on the downcast Pyrrha's eyes. At last, she look'd—and lo! the East grew pale With morning, and then flushing (like some bride Whose ear expects yet fears each distant tread To seek her chamber when the feast is done) Threw out its fiery colours, and became Crimson and burning red. Apollo's steeds, Which wait his coming at the eastern gate, Harness'd were there, and champed their chrystal bits, And threw their flaming foam upon the air. Then first, in all its radiant beauty shone The Rainbow, shadowy arch, of every hue Of light inwove, in Heaven's immortal loom; Gay, rich, illustrious colours mingled there, And shone and were involved each within each, Atoms of loveliest light, orange and blue, Yellow and glowing red and soothing green; Lying across the sky, but vanishing As the clear day came on, the arch was seen. Over Parnassus far the vision hung; And thither, borne along by tide or swell Glided the raft, until a sound like waves Breaking on some rough strand alarmed the air. Then Pyrrha trembled, and Deucalion knew Peril was near, and from his face the smile Faded, and lowering care his eyes o'erspread. No word he uttered, but with straining arms Toiled,—but in vain: the loud and hurrying stream Forced them along, till thro' the whitening waves The horrid rocks peered up as black as death; And the hoarse pebbles rattled on the strand A stormy welcome; and the winds blew loud; And the sea rose and sank, and round the raft Curled with a hungry noise, 'till one huge wave Dashed them along the shore.— There wreck'd they lay; The woman in her husband's guardian arms, (Clasped like a jewel in its sterner case,) But lost to life, and dumb, and motionless: And then that husband, faithful to the grave, Strung once more his worn nerves, and with deep sobs, And staggering steps, and sighs, bore her beyond The tyranny of the seas. “Roar on,” he said— “The treasure of the world is saved at last.” So, pressing those cold lips, her head he raised Upon his knee:—‘She will revive’—he sighed, And fell, half-swooning; and sleep, long-delayed, Came like a cloud and wrapped his limbs in rest. There, on the strand they lay,—Deucalion, Father of this fam'd world, progenitor, And Pyrrha the sad mother, goddess-born; Both wreck'd, tho' saved, because their brothers did Antediluvian sins,—because the wrath Of the high God, great Jove, lay on the earth, And was not to be quenched, unless by blood. There lay they, long-time sleeping; while a Sea— To which the Atlantic with its waste of waves Is poor, tho' from its warring depths it flung Alarums to the moon, and that broad belt Of waters where the Baltic storms are bred Is nought, nor where the Arabian snake is seen Wasting the Nubian coast—A boundless Sea, Paved like the dreamer's brain with livid looks, Rolled far and near, and shook its hideous loads At Heaven; and ever, as the billows bared Their mountain backs and sank, worn with the toil, Howled to the dreaming winds, and the winds sent Fierce answers back and dashed the waves to snow.— So, ere it slumbered in entire repose, Antick'd the Ocean: then, by great degrees Descending from its cloudy strife, tamed down The plunging billows and impetuous depths, Roaring for prey.—And now great Heaven had shut Her windows, and the fountains of the world Damm'd with a word;—and gentle calm came down, And a power arose, which to the earth's deep heart Sucked the vast floods, till vales and hills appeared. —Recovered from their trance, and so refreshed As the tired spirit is by food and sleep, The wanderers looked around. On one fair side Rose hills, and gentle waters murmured near, And vernal meadows where the wild rose blew Spread their fresh carpets. In the midst upsprung A mountain, whose green head some ancient storm Had struck in twain: rich forests deck'd its heights, And laurel wildernesses clothed the sides, And round it flew harmonious winds, whose wings Bore inspiration and the sound of song. Lower, and in the shade of that great hill, A temple lay; untouched by storm or flood It seemed, and white as when, just hewn, it caught Ionian beauty from the carver's skill. Thither they went, perhaps by some strong star Drawn, or the spirit of the place unseen, To ask their doom or own the ruling God:— Thither they went, first parents, whom no child Solaced, yet with hearts lighter than of yore; The woman paler than when first she flung Her curling arms around Deucalion's neck, And he more gravely beautiful, less young, But nearer heaven and like a dream of Jove. They entered.—On a marble pedestal A veiled figure sate, sybil or sage, Or breathing oracle, whose inspired words Were fate—immutable like Death or Love. ?‘Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds.’ —Shakespeare. And near her, from an altar, whose soft flame Was cedar-fed, fumed spice and frankincense, Sandal-wood, aloes, and Arabian gums, Warm odours yielding like the suns of May When blooms are starting, and the fresh green grass Laughs thro' its April tears and hums with life. They knelt, the rough stones kissing, and with fear Prayed; and each took bright leaves of the rich bay There lying, and with low imploring sounds Cast them upon the flame:—And then uprose That figure, which was Justice, and the Queen Of prophecy, and mother of the Hours, Daughter of Earth and Heaven, and bride of Jove, Great Themis. She, unveiling her bright eyes And brow pale as the marble, with a voice Sounding from awful distance, slowly spoke. ‘Children of Dust!’ she said, ‘Hear and revive: The wrath of Heaven has passed, and ye are saved. Go from my temple, and with garments loosed Ossaque post tergum magnæ jactate parentis.Ovid Metam. And faces hidden, your great parent's bones Gather, and cast them o'er your backs.’—They stood Mute with amaze: each to the other looked For help, bewildered; and when sense came back The altar and the goddess were no more. ‘Themis immortal! O return, return! Hear us, O vanish'd Themis!’ (so they moaned) ‘Hear us, and shed thy lustre on our minds, Now dark. We see not, and are very sad. We have endured much fortune, and, though spared, We are alone:—no kin, no friends are ours, None,—no companions save the senseless stones.’ The stones!—'Twas then the riddle of the skies Dissolved. They left that temple, and obeyed Its queen and prophetess:—Deucalion first Plucking from out the earth (which sighed) a stone, Threw it against the wind: It fell,—and lo! Slowly as when the moon unclouds her face, Swelled and grew human; yet not man at once, But leaving like the worm its outer scale, And shooting, as the flower puts forth its leaves, Flexible arms (yet firm,) limbs apt for strength, Muscles and sinuous shape, and streaming veins, And last—the crowning head; which (cold at first, And stiff like some pale mask,) relaxed to life, Unclosing its bright eyes, and in warm cheeks Receiving the first blush of living youth. O wonder! Happiest Pyrrha, with what speed She cast a stone, which like the first up-grew, Yet fairer,—female, with such waving form As Circe or Calypso, free from harm;— Slowly the change went on, from limb to limb, From waist to bosom, swelling like a cloud, White-turning neck, and then the awakening face, And last the eyes unclosed. ‘Immortal Heaven!’— The mother spoke, and for a moment stood Dumb, and with arms outspread then flew along And clasped the new-born vision in her arms. There hung she, and so gazed as mothers do Who clasp pale children gathered from the grave, And saved when hope had perished. ‘Oh!’ she spoke, In low and hurrying tones, ‘Oh! leave me not Again; Ione!—my sole child!—and yet Art thou indeed, with all this skiey grace, Mine own, made perfect without aid of time? Thou stranger on the earth! Heaven's child (and mine)— Oh! vision, die not until Pyrrha dies.’ Thus, to her child restored, the mother spoke; Thus for awhile, yet not her toil forsook: But still, obeying their great oracle, Those early parents cast on high the stones, And ever where they cast the fragments rose Men, strong and young, or women beautiful,— Born by some great enchantment, such as lifts The earth from darkness or dissolves the moon, Or clothes the proud sun in eclipse. —At last, Wearied with toil and new emotion, both Retired, and in a cave o'er which the rose Shook his immortal blooms, and lilies near, Jasmine and musk, daisies and hyacinth, And violets, a blue profusion, sprang Haunting the air, they lay them down and slept. And with soft sleep came dreams, a glittering brood, Its progeny, like stars from darkness bred: And Themis, so it seemed, before them stood, A tow'r-crowned goddess,—a Saturnian shape, Whose forehead mocked the clouds, which round about In throngs came fawning, like aërial slaves; While she, outstretching her right hand, and pale With power call'd upwards from prophetic depths, (Which like a passion shakes immortal frames) Spoke to the Future,—a strange language, born Of Time and Nature, then not understood. And then she touched Deucalion's brow; unsealing With her cold finger, cold as winter ice, The Promethean's sight,—while still he slept. In a moment straight before his eyes there thronged Visions,—vast moving sights, Ocean and Land, Palaces, towns, and temples,—sea-girt isles Floating, and navies of a thousand ships, Armies of steeled men, and shapes that wore Their panther spoils, (nought else)—fierce savages, Rivers and desart wastes, and grassy slopes Crowned with the branching palm, and cedars such As stood on Lebanon and kissed the wind At morning,—and strange scenes and shapes beside. —For a time he looked bewildered; but at last His eye accustomed saw each shape distinct.— First, on rich moving thrones, sceptred and crown'd With oriental gold, dazzling as day, And studded o'er with gems, passed slowly along The kings of Thebes, and ocean-girded Tyre, And Memphis old, and shrunken Babylon,— Huge warrior men, upon whose lips, tho' sad, Hung scorn, and pride in every wrinkled front. Then came a bearded king more mild than they, Father of many sons, all fair and brave, And daughters, one a prophetess: This was The Trojan Priam, at whose city gates The Grecians watched for ten long bloody years, And entered at the last old Ilium. Near him sate one with laurels crown'd, but blind, Who, pausing for a time, spoke forth at last With a voice more solemn than the trumpet's tone Calling armed men to battle: Terrible strife In which the Gods once mingled filled his song, Until descending unto gentler tones, A gentler chord he pressed, and Love was made His theme,—how on the Asian sands a dame Loitered with him she loved and left her lord, (Lacedemonian Helen)—how she stole From Sparta then the sightless poet sung, With the boy Paris, Priam's shepherd son, And how Achilles angered, and the prince Of barren Ithaca was led astray, For ten long wretched years o'er land and wave Wandering in grief and could not reach his home. Following, and as the Magi walk, came two, Hermes and Zoroaster, deemed sun-born, Wise as the ever-watching stars, grave, pale, And shrouded round by superstitious breath, Which bade believe that each one was a God, No less, and could dispense empire and death, Riches, large joy, and charms from every ill. These passed; when, like some picture where each shape Looks so o'er-mastered that life stirs in all, Athens from out a circular cloud up-sprang Bravely, and shewed her temples all and streets, Thro' which proud glorious men walked—one by one, Else in bright throngs, as ages brought them forth With exultation and no painful throes: Kings, princes, and the soldiers of all states (Not Athens alone, but Thebes and Macedon, Corinth and Sparta and the rest) were seen Conspicuous in their shining steel, but most Great poets and grave-eyed philosophers Shone thro' the dream like stars, and lit the land With beauty and truth; for well sage Themis knew Virtue is first and knowledge before arms, Or power, or wealth, or strength in battle shewn. —Cadmus, of that immortal throng the head And leader, (for we pass all meaner tribes) Stood with those wondrous letters in his hand By which bright thought was in its quick flight stopped, And saved from perishing. Amphion next Came with his lute, and Linus fiercely slain, And Orpheus, Thracian shepherd, who made stay Swift rivers in their flow, until too cold The lewd Bacchantes down the Hebrus' stream Rolled his dissevered head, which uttered still ‘Eurydice!’—and then Alcæus passed, Thales, and Sappho, whose so passionate song Failed, tho' all fire, to stir the senseless boy Phaon, and so the amorous Lesbian died. Next came the Macedonian who bestrode Bucephalus (whose spirit, till then untamed, He broke by turning to the blinding sun)— Yet not alone in steeds or in fierce arms Delighted he, but much he loved rich song, And fed his mind upon the tales of Troy:— Then Plato, musing, whose most great delight Was wisdom, which he taught by streams and groves, Making Ilissus and its banks renowned; And Socrates, whose earnest aim was truth, And the star-blinded sage Pythagoras; Praxiteles, and Phidias, and the rest Whose Promethean touch awaken'd life In the cold marble; and that king who died Self-martyr'd in thy strait Thermopylæ! And he who taught retreat o'er woods and plains So well, and desarts strange, and hostile shores; And Archimedes whose fierce art brought down Ruin on cities; and that tragic Three, Athenians, who the dream of life unveiled, Winning men's wondering hearts by speech and verse, And gave this world its best philosophy:— Then passed Demosthenes; and he whom Fame Slanders, sage Epicurus, on whom leaned A youth well fitted for aught wise or good,— Valiant, but wanton Lais bound him down By amorous magic and enchanted toils; And Pericles then, and then Aspasia came, Whose midnight study by some eastern lamp Had paled her cheek, but filled her eyes with thought. Then followed countless endless throngs, like leaves Crowning a woody wilderness,—unnamed, Unknown, save some, on whom chance or the time Fell with redoubled light and made distinct;— Crowd after crowd,—enormous living trains, Men, women, of every shape, and age, and mind (Bright generations) passed along, some robed Like seers, but most with spear or helmet armed, Or in equestrian state, as still we see Graven on gems or marble, and some wreathed With Delphian laurel like Diana's maids, Or roses Cytherean; some with bays Apollo's gift and some the gift of Mars.— Beyond all piercing of the sight they reached Into the future, like a prophet's thought; And still they passed, and still no end was seen,— Heroes, and sages, and fair shapes unborn, Vast towns and towers, temples and aqueducts, Pillar and arch and trophy, all were seen; And Bacchanalian mirth like that which stunned Persepolis, when Philip's son, grown mad, Fired the great city,—around which came sounding Battles and triumphs, and the rage of war, The rout, the riot, and the cloud of arms, The conquest, and captivity,—and death. Such throngs of old were never known to stream From Babylon or Susa, nor when last The Assyrian met the Mede, and marked the bounds Of empire by the gates of Nineveh; Nor when old Rome was highest; nor when more late The Scythian through the Indian valleys broad Swept like a storm.— All that has been, and is, and is to come Was there, made plain,—writ down clear as the stars; A grand Array, beyond all which the grave Could shew, though from its populous arms it threw The treasures of past time, great, wise, and good,— Beyond all thought, all guess or large belief,— Beyond Imagination's widest dreams.— —These things, so Themis bade, assumed brief life:— But whither they fled, or when the Titan shook That rich sleep off, and in the awakening light Bathed his flushed forehead, still remains unsung In story;—yet, before his sight, 'tis told, Stood Pyrrha, fairest of earth's visions still, Who on his tranced slumber long had looked, Whispering the Gods for comfort. He awoke:— And o'er him, gently bending, children hung, (He their creator) and a new-born world Opened upon his sense,—a Paradise Of flowers and fruits, sweet winds and cloudless skies, And azure waters winding to the main, And forest walks, and (far off) sounds which break The sun-set silence, and the songs of birds Chanting melodious mirth:—Vernal delights Haunted the air, and youth which knew no pang Ran through all living veins, and touched all eyes With beauty:—the tall branches waved their plumes; The water trembled; and the amorous sun Came darting from his orb: Eagles and doves, Paired in the ether, and the branching stag Fled from his shadow on the grass-green plain.— O golden hours! O world! now stained with crime, Immaculate then, methinks thy perfect fame Should live in song! Methinks some bard, whose heart Traces its courage to Promethean veins, Should build in lasting verse, firmer than mine, Deucalion's story,—(upon Delphi's steep Saved from the watery waste,) and Pyrrha's woe. THE GIRL OF PROVENCE. The following passage (which occurs in “Collinson's Essay on Lunacy”) suggested the poem of the “Girl of Provence.” The reader will perceive, however, that it forms the material of only the concluding stanzas. “The enthusiasm of a Girl from Provence had lately occupied my mind. It was a singular occurrence which I shall never forget. I was present at the national Museum when this Girl entered the Salle d' Apollon: she was tall, and elegantly formed, and in all the bloom of health. I was struck with her air, and my eyes involuntarily followed her steps. I saw her start as she cast her eyes on the statue of Apollo, and she stood before it as if struck with lightning, her eyes gradually sparkling with sensibility. She had before looked calmly around the Hall; but her whole frame seemed to be then electrified as if a transformation had taken place within her; and it has since appeared, that a transformation had taken place, and that her youthful breast had imbibed a powerful, alas! fatal passion. I remarked, that her companion (an elder sister it seems) could not force her to leave the statue, but with much entreaty, and she left the Hall with tears in her eyes, and all the expressions of tender sorrow. I set out the very same evening for Montmorency. I returned to Paris at the end of August, and visited immediately the magnificent collection of antiques. I recollected the Girl from Provence, and thought perhaps I might meet with her again; but I never saw her afterwards, though I went frequently. At length I met with one of the attendants, who, I recollected, had observed her with the same attentive curiosity which I had felt; and I enquired after her. ‘Poor Girl!’ said the old man, `that was a sad visit for her. She came afterwards every day to look at the statue, and she would sit still, with her hands folded in her lap, staring at the image, and when her friends forced her away, it was always with tears that she left the Hall. In the middle of May she brought, whenever she came, a basket of flowers and placed it on the Mosaic steps. One morning early she contrived to get into the room before the usual hour of opening it, and we found her within the grate, sitting within the steps almost fainting, exhausted with weeping. The whole Hall was scented with the perfume of flowers, and she had elegantly thrown over the statue a large veil of India muslin, with a golden fringe. We pitied the deplorable condition of the lovely-girl, and let no one into the Hall until her friends came and carried her home. She struggled and resisted exceedingly when forced away; and declared in her frenzy that the god had that night chosen her to be his priestess, and that she must serve him. We have never seen her since, but have heard that an opiate was given her, and she was taken into the country!’ I made further enquiries concerning her history, and learned that she died raving.”— Related by Madame de Haster, a German lady. ? A dream of Love Shaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast Longed for a deathless lover from above. Lord. Byron.—Ch. Harold. I If there be aught within thy pleasant land, Fair France, which to the poet help may be— If thou art haunted by a Muse,—command That now she cast her precious spell on me: Bid that the verse I write be fair and free; So may I, an untravelled stranger, sing Like one who drinketh of Apollo's spring. II For,—tho' I never beneath eastern suns Wandered, nor by Parnassus hill so high, Nor where in beauty that bright fountain runs Struck by the winged horse that scaled the sky, Nor ever in the meads of Arcady, In flowery Enna, or Thessalian shade, Heard sweet the pastoral pipe at evening played,— III Yet have I chosen, from the throngs of tale Which crowded on me in life's dreaming hours, One—sad indeed, but such as may not fail To attest the peerless king's undying powers, Who, like a light amongst Elysian bowers Still moveth, while the sun (his empty throne) Floats onwards, in its weary round, alone. IV Ages and years have been and passed away, And Mirth with light and Hope with rain-bow wings Have flown, and Grief borne slow on pinions gray, Since thou wast worshipp'd at the Delphian springs, Whereby no longer now a poet sings: Yet hast thou been, O Phœbus! well repaid By the deep love of one Provencal maid. V Come!—with thy raven tresses loosely hung, Thou nymph translated to the skies! Breathe! Sigh! Let thy dark odorous hair be round me flung And twined (rich inspiration!) till I die For love of thee—a shadow; so may I, Stung to etherial life, declare thy pain:— Till then, whate'er I sing—I sing in vain. VI Eva!—pale rose of Provence! where art thou? Thy harp is silent,—gone, thy home forlorn: Mute anguish lieth on thy sister's brow: Thy father's eye, (once proud and like a morn Of sparkling June) is emptied of its scorn:— Ah! bid me (and thou aid) in gentle verse And words fair as thyself, thy tale rehearse. VII In France—in sunny France, the fields are gay; Earth's fruits are richest there, and ripen soon: The shrill lark welcometh a brighter day, And, free and sheltered from the fiery noon, The summer-sweet Acanthis sings her tune; Or in the glassy waters looketh long, Until the nightingale begins her song. VIII O Provence! in thy groves and vine-hung bowers Doth still that creature pine—that little bird Who weeps her very soul away in showers Of music,—only at the nightfall heard, Yet sweeter far than any human word? Still doth it pine?—or are the rose and thou Deserted for some happier region now? IX Once, how it used to fill the fragrant air With melancholy sounds that touched the brain! But that was when pale Eva bound her hair With flowers, that blushing into bloom again Alarmed the bird to most melodious pain. Those days are gone.—Oh! is the twilight pale Made amorous still by the lone nightingale?— X Fair Eva was De Varenne's gentle child, Most gentle, from a rugged sire descended, As April springeth from the winter wild, A thing of rain and light gracefully blended, Weeping inheritor! whose life is ended Almost before the trump of March is dumb; Dying in showers ere green Spring hath come. XI Scarce eighteen summers by the Durance' side, Which freshens the Provencal vallies green With its bright waters, did that maid abide, Beheld by few, yet loved as soon as seen, And ripening as her mother once had been,— Scarce eighteen summers, ere a sorrow strange Fell from the sky, and wrought mysterious change. XII How gracefully she lived can many tell; How meekly too she bore her father's frown; Though seldom on his patient child it fell, And quickly then she smiled and soothed it down, Or else would in harmonious measures drown His wrath, (as water quells the angry flame) Till Love returned, or slow Oblivion came. XIII Two children,—Eva and young Heloise, Were all that fortune to De Varenne gave, When from his wars beyond the Pyrenees He came to mourn upon Aurelia's grave. Oh! why should sorrow weep and never save! She died, sad mother, and her husband wept When closer to his heart her children crept. XIV For once he wept; but quickly from his eye The fire that flashed therein dried up the tear, And he assumed again that conduct high Which bred a duteous love, not freed of fear, Hallowing the lives of those his daughters dear: Better perhaps if Love alone had dwelt Within, and awed their young hearts while they knelt. XV For her who bore them, when she drooped and died, Exceeding sorrow did those children feel, And oft they wished to slumber by her side, And to her ear their pretty griefs reveal; At last a delicate bloom began to steal Over their cheeks, and beauty waved and spread About them, and with grace their every motion fed. XVI In Heloise a blither glance was seen, A firmer step, a brighter, darker eye; Her words were clear, like sounds that run between The forest branches when some brook is nigh; And scorn sat smiling on her forehead high. “Thou art De Varenne's girl,” the father said: “And Eva?”—sighed that child, and hung her head. XVII “Eva! thy sister thou resemblest not; She cheers my soul, and is ashamed to pine: Her grief has died; why is not thine forgot? Thou art thy mother's all, and she is mine. My peerless child, I kiss thee,—my divine! What a clear beauty laughs through her disdain! My joy!” he said, and kissed his child again. XVIII And so—(one favoured, and the other worn By harsh neglect, and care before its time,) Fled on life's early hours, until its morn: Then gleamed the eyes of one sad and sublime, And in the other's laughed a sunnier clime, A paradise of beauty bright and young, And over all a heaven of love was flung. XIX Oh! radiant creature, fairer than the sun, How dim was she beside thee,—how dismayed! Thou like the east where dancing splendours run, She like the quivering alder's deepest shade; Yet peerless in your wild-wood leaves arrayed Were both,—sweet children of the sylvan hours, Subjects of Love, who dies in courts and costly bowers. XX In courts, where revel reigns, and passionate song Floats like a triumph on the Bacchant's breath, Ah! what hath love to do,—unless prolong Its rare existence to a lingering death? And die it must in war, the soldier saith; Its voice is shivered by the trumpet's tone: It sees the fiery fight,—and lo! 'tis flown. XXI It hath no home upon the weltering seas; Or if it hideth there, on bitter food It feeds, lone, trembling at each idle breeze, Until 'tis blasted by the battle rude, A gentle thing with gentle strength endued, By absence kill'd,—by scorn;—as often slain By poisonous pleasure as the sting of pain. XXII Fair Love!—Beside the fountains and bright fields, By running waters and in mossy glades, (Tasting whatever the green quiet yields) He roams, from morning till the evening shades Fall, and the world like a phantasma fades: There roams he, like a Sylvan, whom the air Worships,—unwing'd, and making all his care. XXIII There, night and day are his. The radiant sky Is doubly beautiful, and sun, and shower, And rainbows which upon the mountains lie, And twice its common odour hath the flower, And doubly filled with joy is every hour; And music hangeth on the winds and floods, And lingereth in the caves and desart woods: XXIV And in the populous forests thick with life, Which (deep and cool as Faunus ever knew) Are haunted only by melodious strife, Of birds or insects, when the year is new Feeding upon the fragrant summer dew: And there the untiring seasons bring, for aye, To night rich slumber, and fresh life to day. XXV And Beauty, in her own eternal form, (The same that witch'd the Dardan shepherd young) Abideth.—Art doth never there deform The amaranthine hues which life hath flung O'er lips and cheeks to crimson blushes stung; But free as is the elemental air Nature and Beauty live,—and both are fair. XXVI And both might in De Varenne's home be seen, For there his daughters wore the early day, The one entranced by some high perilous scene, The other, fonder of a gentler lay, Read how the Gods from their celestial way Would wander for the Naiads' loves, or take An earthly form,—and all for Beauty's sake. XXVII She read how Jove from out the gates of light Came downwards, shining like a mist of gold, And how fond Semele became star-bright, And Anaxareté a statue cold, Prisoned, tho' dead, within her mortal mould: She read of eyes made lovelier than the morn Through love, and blinded by excess of scorn. XXVIII And so her gentle spirit, fed by time With radiant fable, from its earth up-grew, (As mountain clouds float, erring but sublime, Thro' the blue air) and hung on visions new, Like wing'd Imagination false yet true: And that imperial passion that doth reign O'er every nerve, grew bright within her brain.— XXIX —How beautiful is morning, when the streams Of light come running up the eastern skies! How beautiful is life, in those young dreams Of joy, and faith,—of love that never flies, Chained like the soul to truth;—but ah! it dics Sometimes, and sometimes, with the adder's spite Stings the true heart that nursed it, day and night. XXX And beautiful is great Apollo's page: But they who dare to read his burning lines Go mad,—and ever after with blind rage Rave of the skiey secrets and bright signs: But all they tell is vain; for death entwines The struggling utterance, and the words expire Dumb,—self-consum'd, like some too furious fire. XXXI —One night a revel had been held, and dance And song had sounded in the ear of night, And many a gallant that had grasped a lance, And been the foremost in a bloody fight, Then moved a measure with his lady bright, And pressed her jewell'd arm and told his pain. Alas! that Love should ever speak in vain! XXXII Only the lonely Eva sate apart,— While young Chatillion in her sister's ear Poured his love music, till her beating heart, And eyes that glittering grew and large and clear, And the strange transport and the crimson fear That stained the beauty of their cheeks, betrayed How much the lover loved, and how the maid. XXXIII The midnight lamps were o'er them, and the flare Of light, which shone at times and died away, Glanced like the shifting sunshine on her hair, And brought her ringlets out in rich array: And there the lover's looks, like break of day, Were seen, fixed—helpless:—Oh! a radiant spell Was on him, and he knew its perils well. XXXIV But Eva, in the shadow dim, like one Who sought her husband in the clouds, reclined; A vestal of the world,—because the Sun Hid his tyrannic beauty:—there she pined, Pale as a prophetess whose labouring mind Gives out its knowledge; but her up-raised eyes Shone with the languid light of one who loves or dies. XXXV So, in one bright creation (through the earth Unmatch'd) is love writ down:—no words are there, But all is clear like some eternal birth Of heaven,—a golden star,—the azure air: Oh! I remember well how soft, how fair, That vision shone,—how like a dream of youth, How full of life, and love, and burning truth! XXXVI Masses of living cloud were there,—and are; And Love is there, unseen; and amorous light Fills the dim ether; and the passionate war Of kisses, like the silence of the night, Is heard; and every branch and leaf is bright With love; and in the trembling waters near, Tamed by some presence, drinks the bending deer. XXXVII And in the midst—O girl! whose curling limbs A god has breathed on till they sting the brain With beauty—Look! how in her eye there swims Intolerable joy— XXXVIII Io!—fair Io!—thou didst dearly earn, By after wanderings and transformed hours, The love of Jove.—Fair Eva! thou didst burn Self-martyred in thy green Provencal bowers, Consumed to dust before Apollo's powers. Both fell from too much love.—Sweet woman, still Is thy love-harvest filled with so much ill? XXXIX —That night of revelry the victim's mind Shook in its height: firm reason and clear thought Forsook her, and her soul awhile grew blind, Seared by the light of love, and wandering sought Its way through perilous regions now forgot, Through haunts of death and life, and the throng'd way Of darkness,—to insufferable day. XL That night she lay within her silken nest, White creature, dreaming till the golden dawn; When Phœbus, shaking off his skiey rest, Descended. Trembling, like a frighted fawn, She lay, bewildered, pale:—The orient morn Wept, and the Hours blushed scarlet, and the array Of Heaven, (stars, moon, and clouds,) were swept away. XLI No presence in the o'er-arching vault was seen Save his,—Apollo's; who, unlike a God, Quitted his fiery height, and on the green Starr'd with white hyacinths and daisies, trod: And wheresoe'er he stepped the flushing sod Threw flowers from out its heart, and from her room Came odours, like the heliotrope's perfume. XLII Awhile he stayed:—he gazed,—perhaps a thought That so much beauty was not born to die, Assailed him; but not long that pity wrought, For through his brightening form and his large eye Shot passion, shaming the immaculate sky, Where kindness lives with love, and hate is known, Like mortal follies, by its name alone. XLIII He took her, gently, in his radiant arms, And breathed on her, and bore her through the air, Hushing from time to time her sweet alarms, And whispering still that one so good and fair Should dread no evil thought and know no care: And still they flew, and around a lustre played, Near them, as near a figure plays its shade. XLIV Their course seemed pointed to some southern shore. Over the waters where the trade-winds blew They passed, and where men find the golden ore, And where long since the Hesperian apples grew; While, far beneath, the Old world and the New Stretched out their tiny shapes, and their thick chain Of islands, spangling like bright gems the main. XLV And then they moved beneath a lovelier sky, O'er green savannahs where cool waters run; O'er hills and valleys; o'er vast plains that lie Flat,—desarts blistered by the Afric sun; Over spice-groves and woods of cinnamon; By Siam and Malay; and many a fair Bright country basking in the Indian air. XLVI Whither they journeyed then, ah, who may tell!— Beyond all limits that the sailor knows; Beyond the ocean; and beyond the swell Of mountains; and beyond the Antarctic snows: To some sweet haunt, 'tis told, where softly glows Perpetual day,—some island of the air: We know its beauty; but we know not where. XLVII —Eternal forests, on whose boughs the Spring Hung undecaying, fenced the place around, And amorous vines, (like serpents without sting) Clung to the trees, or trailed on the green ground, And fountains threw on high a silver sound, And glades interminably long, between Whose branches sported the grey deer, were seen. XLVIII And from the clustering boughs the nightingale Sang her lament; while on a reedy stream, Which murmured and far off was heard to fall, The swan went sailing by, like a white dream; And somewhere near did the lone cuckoo call, But none made answer; and his amorous theme The thrush loud uttered till it spoke of pain; And many a creature sang, but seemed to sing in vain. XLIX There, rich with fruits, the tree of Paradise (The plantain) spread its large and slender leaves, And there the pictur'd palm was seen to rise, And trembling aspen, and the tree that grieves, (The willow) and sun-flowers like golden sheaves; The lady lily paler than the moon, And roses, laden with the breath of June. L And in the midst a crystal palace stood On pillars shining with immortal gold: Its gates were golden, and some artist good Had carved them till each nook and corner told Some wonder of the Sun or story old; And rainbow landscapes copied from the skies Shone in the metal with a thousand dies. LI Upon those gates no sounding horn was hung: No warder answered from his watching tower: But silence over all the place was flung, Making it holy as Egeria's bower, And gentle splendour, like the evening hour, Mingled with shadows fine its finer ray, And fed the place with beauty night and day. LII All these the lover to his love displayed:— The palace whose bright top was hid in heaven, The lustrous pillars and the long arcade, The statue,—where it seemed some God had striven With immortality,—and failed, yet given The marble likeness of Apollo's smile, His grace, his glance almost,—but not his guile. LIII There, a vast hall far spread and high was seen, So high—the falcon might have tired his wing Nor touched the roof, whereon, with stars between Shone Heaven's wide kingdoms, all,—a radiant ring, And from the midst Apollo seemed to spring— (Was he the phantom of her hopes,—no more?) She trembled,—wept,—but still he seemed to soar. LIV And, far away from out that central hall Ran arched passages diverging far, Each with its doors and range of rooms, and all (Self-lighted as by some presiding star) Shone spacious and the most harmonious jar Of voices and irregular footsteps near And busy words, like life, broke on her ear: LV And music, like the dissonance of Gods, Rich,—Bacchanalian, as when Hebe crowns Their cups with kisses, and through all the abodes Of Heaven a sudden shout breaks forth that drowns The air with laughter, and shakes earthly towns To dust, — immortal Music in her bower Sung, till Apollo struck the golden hour. LVI Then, in that stillness, Eva heard a voice From one unseen beside her. Thus it said: ‘Welcome my sovereign lady, and rejoice! Fear not: but on the flowery pavements tread, Or on these downy pillows rest your head, Or bathe your beauty in the waters near, Or drink,—behold, the nectarous draught is here.’ LVII She gazed,—and slowly from the marble ground O'er-strewed with flowers a golden table sprung, Where fruits of matchless fragrance did abound, And nameless dainties all together flung, And on their boughs Hesperian apples hung, And nectar ravishing to taste,—like gleams From Circe's eyes, or love-enchanted dreams. LVIII Fair girl, she left untouched that nectarous wine, Fruits and ambrosian food, and strayed along The pictured rooms, all fair (and some divine) With skiey stories since made plain by song, And women, an imperishable throng, Lifted from earth to heaven by force of love, And purified by light and the glance of Jove. LIX There ceilings spread abroad their cloudless hues, And stars shone from them, and the sounds of wings Were heard like rushing waters, when they lose Their life in foam, and down the pillars springs Ran like the fluid lightning, when it clings (Or seems) around some pine or shattered oak, And every room some bright and different marvel spoke. LX Through all the palace,—pillars, and arches wide, And floors, and roofs, (it seemed a mystic plan, And only by the curious eye espied) Instinct with light a living splendour ran, As blood goes streaming through the heart of man, And every hinge and joint was fed by fire, Which flowed half hidden like some veiled desire. LXI All day she traversed her imperial home, With wonder gazing, and strange mute delight; And then she prayed her absent love to come, And bade him hurry the too slow twilight; And then the coming of immortal night She dreaded, its sublime and dark array; And thus, 'tween fears and pleasure, fled the day. LXII Twilight is come,—calm mournful hour, for those Whom years have quelled, whom cold dread thoughts engage, But life hath fires before we reach its snows, And youth treads fiercely on the ground that age Shuns with a timid glance and sad presage; And twilight hath no terrors, no repose, For hearts where Love's impetuous spirit glows. LXIII Twilight is come: but where is he whose word Should be as holy as the Heavens?—Afar Through all the empyreal air no noise is heard, Nor vision seen, nor bright descending star; No sight, no sound; only the ebb and jar Of meeting passions in one heart, until A hymn arose which broke that silence chill. 1. Apollo!—king Apollo! In what enchanted region dost thou stay?— Is it in the azure air Or in the caverns hollow, Which Thetis at the set of day In the sea waters far away Buildeth up, as blue and fair As thy own bright kingdoms are? 2. Oh, King of life and light! O peerless Archer! O triumphant God! Behold!—the golden rod Now pointeth to the promised hour,—twilight; And she who loves thee so Is pale and full of woe.— No wave nor throne have I, No bower nor golden grove, No palace built on high, To tempt thee not to rove, But truth, and such a love As would not shame the sky,— If these be nothing, Time Shall teach me how to die. 3. Yet come not, great Apollo! come not here; The hour has vanished, and thou needs must sta In those sea waters far away:— For me,—neglect and fear Are my fit bridal cheer: An earthly creature what had I to do With sights of heaven or pleasures of the skies! Oh! master and my king, thy slave despise! Now from thy station wheresoe'er it be— Within the waving sea Or in the pathless blue— Look down, in thy divine Disdain, and from thy lips Shed darkness and eclipse, The fit requital for a love like mine!— LXIV She ended; and above, as from a cloud, The eternal sun broke forth:—no shape was there, No voice, but soft winds all the branches bowed, And wide illuminations filled the air, And beauty looked so lovely that despair Fled, and innocuous warmth and cheering light Fell on the mournful girl like some late lost delight. LXV No tear now stained her cheek; no failing tones Telling of anguish hid, or dull with pain; But grief is given to the wind that moans Amongst the forest boughs, and to the main And to the rivers all who must complain Yet feel no sorrow to the end of time— As years all filled with blood are freed of crime. LXVI But when the twilight fell, that gentle child Felt a strange terror, till a voice she knew (It was Apollo's) spoke, but oh! so mild, So like familiar tones we know are true! And his too fiery glance was quenched in dew: “Eva, my mortal love, the day has burned To its decline, and lo! I have returned.” LXVII So spake he, and the maid with downcast eyes, And flushing forehead which had lost its snow, Him answered, (while her breast like summer-skies Spread out its breathing paradise below, And rose and fell as billows swell and flow)— “My master! art thou here?”—and with a sigh Raising her eyes, she saw him smiling nigh. LXVIII Oh! never was a smile so full of scorn As that which glanced along his curved lip; And his eyes sparkled like the approach of morn; Yet sweeter were his words than winds that sip The dew from hyacinths:—Oh! canst thou strip Thy bird of plumage, and her sweet despair, Which flowed in music to thee, never spare?— LXIX “Apollo! king Apollo!”—That wild cry Was heard in Ilium when its end was near, From Priam's Sybil daughter, who with an eye Made bright by prophet dreams and wise by fear, Saw the red ruin and the flashing spear Through all the darkness of the untold to-morrow, And heard the Spartan's cry, the Trojan's sorrow: LXX Apollo! king Apollo!—Is thy scorn Not dead,—and were Cassandra's tears in vain? Her words (an oracle)—her life forlorn, Stung through by unbelief and fierce disdain?— Her crowned exile and her death of pain?— Still dost thou ask new love and fresh despair, And hopes born but to perish?—Spare! O spare! LXXI I speak in vain:—The chariot of the hour Is rolling onwards,—over kings and slaves, Passionate spirits, and the crimson flower Of love, which Hermes' magic never saves,— Over rebellions and the gloom of graves,— Through light and darkness, and the eternal woe Of life,—to regions which no thought may know. LXXII Older than ruin, or the dust that hides Persepolis or Balbec, and yet fair Like early manhood, the great Phantom rides (Time or the Hour) above us:—Where, O where?— Through Hell, and Heaven, in Earth, and the wide Air; Invisibly he goes, and without sound, Like Death, a tyrant,—shapeless but uncrowned. LXXIII He passes:—Oh! not all the suns that shine, Not all the Autumn floods nor Winter's rain, Nor all that poets tell of, though divine, Shall clear thy annals of so foul a stain:— He passes, and is gone;—and I complain Unto the silence; and return dismayed To tell thy latest grief, sad Provence maid!— LXXIV The hour has passed;—and Night, who laughs at time, Shakes out her spangled hair in loose array, And, clasped with coronets of gems sublime, Sits like a queen, to whom, at death of Day, (She bright successor) a whole world must pay Low adoration,—while the sleepless care Must watch her glittering vigils shining fair. LXXV That night—Oh! never shall its silent hours, Its love—its darkness be profaned by me: If I must tell, be it of vine-leaf bowers Where Bacchanal delight is loud and free, Or Aphrodite's home hung round with flowers, Or coral branches from her native sea; For love is her wide boast: but clouds should hide The young hot blushes of a human bride. LXXVI And yet night came (voluptuous night!) and sleep Weighed down the eye-lids of Apollo's bride, Who sank into a tremulous slumber deep, Believing now his falling locks she spied, Or heard him breathing odours by her side, Or felt his burning kisses on her lips, Or saw his eyes bent o'er her, in eclipse. LXXVII And once she dreamed he said “Awake! arise, Daughter of clay: Behold! the truth is plain: Thou hast looked love on me with impious eyes, On me—a God, and with enchantments vain Bound me, and thou must die.” A thrilling pain Traversed her heart, while thus the Pythian spoke, And sleep was scared by terror, and she woke. LXXVIII She rose, and saw him in his beauty laid Beside her: O'er his limbs a tender light Hung floating, and his head looked all arrayed With a halo, as the glow-worm looks by night, Or like a lunar rainbow pale and bright,— Encompassed and enshrined by the clear breath Of Heaven, which saves immortal frames from death: LXXIX And on his lips there lay a rose-red leaf Courting the kiss she gave, and did not fade— (How could it feel a touch so soft and brief?) And then she pressed the violet veins that strayed Over his throat, and then shrank back afraid Gazing upon the God—who calmly slept, While to her couch the trembling creature crept. LXXX This past she slept, and of sky-piercing towers She dreamed, and banquets held beneath the moon, And trod on stars, and through illumin'd bowers Paced like a dancer, whom some eager tune Leads on to pleasure which must perish soon: Yet still by her white side Apollo lay, (She dreamed) 'till darkness faded into day. LXXXI The morning broke, and she was Phœbus' bride: And evening fell:—But did the God return?— He came not,—he came never to her side; But her bright Dream (for 'twas a dream) did burn Madness upon her, and the world did spurn Her story for a folly:—yet she believed; And o'er her widow'd passion meekly grieved. LXXXII Like Ariadne, when in pale despair The Athenian left her,—so sad Eva pined, And so she went complaining to the air, And gave her tresses to the careless wind:— The colour of her fate was on her mind, Dark, death-like, and despairing;—and her eye Shone lustrous like the light of prophecy. LXXXIII Over the grassy meads,—beside lone streams, To perilous heights which no weak step could reach She wandered, feeding her unearthly dreams With musing, and would move the tremulous beech And shuddering aspen with imploring speech; For nothing that did live, save they (who sighed) Pitied the downfall of her amorous pride.— LXXXIV —There is a story:—that some lady came To Paris; and while she—('tis years ago!) Was gazing at the marbles, and the fame Of colour which threw out a sunset glow, A tall girl entered, with staid steps and slow, The immortal hall where Phœbus stood arrayed In stone,—and started back, trembling, dismayed. LXXXV Yet still she looked, tho' mute, and her clear eye Fed on the image till a rapture grew, Chasing the cloudy fear that hovered nigh, And filling with soft light her glances blue; And still she trembled, for a pleasure new Thrilled her young veins, and stammering accents ran Over her tongue, as thus her speech began:— LXXXVI “Apollo! king Apollo!—art thou here? Art thou indeed returned?”—and then her eyes Outwept her joy, and hope and passionate fear Seized on her heart, as tow'rds the dazzling prize She moved, like one who sees a shape that flies, And stood entranced before the marble dream, Which made the Greek immortal, like his theme. LXXXVII Life in each limb is seen, and on the brow Absolute God;—no stone nor mockery shape But the resistless Sun,—the rage and glow Of Phœbus as he tried in vain to rape Evergreen Daphne, or when his rays escape Scorching the Lybian desart or gaunt side Of Atlas, withering the great giant's pride. LXXXVIII And round his head and round his limbs have clung Life and the flush of Heaven, and youth divine, And in the breathed nostril backwards flung, And in the terrors of his face, that shine Right through the marble, which will never pine To paleness though a thousand years have fled, But looks above all fate, and mocks the dead. LXXXIX Yet stands he not as when blithely he guides Tameless Eoüs from the golden shores Of morning, nor when in calm strength he rides Over the scorpion, while the lion roars Seared by his burning chariot which out-pours Floods of eternal light o'er hill and plain, But, like a triumph, o'er the Python slain: XC He stands with serene brow and lip upcurl'd By scorn, such as Gods felt, when on the head Of beast or monster or vain man they hurled Thunder, and loosed the lightning from its bed, Where it lies chained, by blood and torment fed; His fine arm is outstretched,—his arrow flown, And the wrath flashes from his eyes of stone, XCI Like Day—or liker the fierce morn, (so young)— Like the sea-tempest which against the wind Comes dumb, while all its terrible joints are strung To death and rapine:—Ah! if he unbind His marble fillet now and strike her blind— Away, away!—vain fear! unharmed she stands, With fastened eyes and white beseeching hands. XCII —Alas! that madness, like the worm that stings, Should dart its venom through the tender brain! Alas! that to all ills which darkness brings Fierce day should send abroad its phantoms plain, Shook from their natural hell, (a hideous train) To wander through the world, and vex it sore, Which might be happy else for ever-more. XCIII Lust, and the dread of death, and white Despair, (A wreck, from changed friends and hopes all fled), Ambition which is sleepless, and dull care Which wrinkles the young brow, and sorrows bred From love which strikes the heart and sears the head, The lightning of the passions,—in whose ray Eva's bright spirit wasted, day by day. XCIV She was Apollo's votary, (so she deemed) His bride, and met him in his radiant bowers, And sometimes, as his priestess pale beseemed, She strewed before his image, like the Hours, Delicate blooms, spring buds and summer flowers, Faint violets, dainty lilies, the red rose,— What time his splendour in the Eastern glows. XCV And these she took and strewed before his feet, And tore the laurel (his own leaf) to pay Homage unto its God, and the plant sweet That turns its bosom to the sunny ray, And all which open at the break of day, And all which worthy are to pay him due Honour,—pink, saffron, crimson, pied, or blue. XCVI And ever, when was done her flowery toil, She stood (idolatress!) and languished there, She and the God, alone;—nor would she spoil The silence with her voice, but with mute care Over his carved limbs a garment fair She threw, still worshipping with amorous pain, Still watching ever his divine disdain. XCVII —Time past:—and when that German lady came Again to Paris, where the image stands, (It was in August, and the hot sun-flame Shot thro' the windows)—midst the gazing bands She sought for her whose white-beseeching hands Spoke so imploringly before the stone, (The Provence girl)—she asked; but she was gone. XCVIII Whither none knew;—Some said that she would come Always at morning with her blooming store, And gaze upon the marble, pale and dumb, But that, they thought, the tender worship wore The girl to death; for o'er her eyes and o'er Her paling cheek hues like the grave were spread: And one at last knew further;—She was dead. XCIX She died, mad as the winds,—mad as the sea Which rages for the beauty of the moon, Mad as the poet is whose fancies flee Up to the stars to claim some boundless boon, Mad as the forest when the tempests tune Their breath to song and shake its leafy pride, Yet trembling like its shadows:—So she died. C She died at morning when the gentle streams Of day came peering thro' the far east sky, And that same light which wrought her maddening dreams, Brought back her mind. She awoke with gentle cry, And in the light she loved she wished to die:— She perished, when no more she could endure, Hallowed before it, like a martyr pure. THE LETTER OF BOCCACCIO. As the following ‘Letter’ involves a few particulars of the early life of the famous Italian novelist, it may be as well to state briefly what are and what are not facts. Of Giovanni Boccaccio, the great author of the ‘Decameron,’ little seems to be known. He was born at Certaldo, (or Florence) about the year 1313, and when he arrived at manhood, was, according to some accounts, placed under the law professor Cino de Pistoia. His father dying soon after, Boccaccio gave himself up to poetry, and studied also the classics and the sciences with great effect. He himself says, in one of his letters, (to Petrarch I believe) that he was the means of introducing the Greek language into Etruria. The circumstance of Boccaccio having led a dissolute life at Florence, and having been reproved by a Carthusian friar, are stated as facts, if I recollect rightly, in Mrs. Dobson's Life of Petrarch; and that he was intimate with the famous lover of Laura is known to all. The story which I have admitted, of his having been in love with a lady near Florence, is the fiction of the authoress of ‘Petrarque et Laure:’ although he was actually attached to a female, whom he celebrates under the name of Fiametta. Some persons say that this lady was Mary of Arragon, (daughter of Robert, King of Naples) whom Boccaccio first saw in the church of the Cordeliers. Whether this be the absolute fact or not, I leave to others. It is sufficient at least for the origin of this ‘Letter,’ which the reader will suppose to be addressed to her. [I.] O thou, before whose beauty my young spirit Hath bowed,—so long oppressed by amorous pain; If I have sold the thoughts which I inherit From my free nature, do not thou arraign That now, poor slave, I bear Love's glittering chain! It wears me,—it consumes me; yet I love, And that is my reward.—Shall I return Into the past, and quench the fires that burn Within and hallow me, (as some dark grove By ever-living lamps is made most pure)?— Can I return,—I who have dwelt with Love, And fed on passionate dreams? Can I endure That tyranny of thought which strips the heart Bare of its hope, and gives it—barren truth?— Thou wast the virgin idol of my youth:— Thou wast?—thou art; and shall a weak dismay Of possible ill lure my weak heart to stray? Shall I be told that woman is not true?— That Love hath died who was a god of yore?— That Fortune is a sea without a shore, Where they who venture not have nought to rue?— Shall I believe all this and look on thee?— It cannot be,—it may not, if I array My mind with faith, as in my better day:— So with a bright belief I look on thee, Thou beauty of the South, as on the Sun, Who deigns to gild the slave he looks upon. —Shall nothing but thy shadow fall on me? 'Tis true I have not much that can adorn Thy conquest,—not in fortune,—not in name; But I may prostrate still the little fame I have, and even this thou wilt not scorn; Thou wilt not, for thine eye is like a morn Whereby men augur of the day to come, And in thy silence thou wast never dumb; So, spirit sweet, will I of thee foretell. Thy young voice is a truer oracle Than that which in the old Saturnian days Sounded at Delos in Apollo's praise, And did the tasks of Pagan prophets well; And thy white beauty is (for never yet Could Nature mould such creature and forget The perfect soul) assurance unto me Of thy unuttered fidelity:— Therefore, by yellow Hymen, do I swear To make thee my reliance, my sweet care, My all of memory, my extremest hope:— Fool that I am, methinks I cannot cope With my antagonist ills: the idle shade Of joy stalks forth and straight I am betrayed. Hope has fled far: the future, which was late Dream-bright, is now a calm unaltering fate; And Friendship has usurped the name of Love; And passion, bright as the fire the Titan stole, Has burned to its decline. Do not reprove; For still, at times, it flames beyond control, And is again the madness of my soul. I will not change: or if I wander, soon Shall I return, and be as is the moon Who, tho' she change, returneth, nothing loth, And faithful to the beauty of her youth? Like her my peerless love shall shine,—yet not On altars or in sepulchres, but where My faith to thee shall never be forgot:— It shall be holy as the autumnal air, And fashioned into music, and along The tides of time be borne, with things as fair, In all the immortality of song. It shall live unalarm'd by hint or jest, The one great virtue of Boccaccio's breast:— For 'tis not erring wishes, nor the shock Of doubts which force the changing man to mock Love in his temple,—'till he dies of shame, But 'tis the laughing lie—the petty blame That frets and turns the human milk to gall, And, tho' it scarce seem bitter, poisoneth all.— II. When last I saw thee—(following in thy train Was I)—O would those times might be again! They were too happy, sweet! and therefore brief, And withered, like an early budding leaf, Which, while its cold associates still are seen Flourishing, having lived its age, (in hours!) And wasted on the wanton Spring its powers, Doth die upon its stem of summer green: Therefore it may not be.—O princely maid! When last I saw thee, was not promise made That I should tell my story (all) to thee? Yes,—we were sitting underneath a tree Which shook its odours on the Baian waves. Thou must remember it:—We gazed together Enchanted by the glassy sea that laves The Cape and islands, in that sunny weather Seen plainly from the Pausillippo hill. Hast thou forgotten how we talked of him Whose ashes slumber there, holy and still? From which his name, that never shall grow dim, Sprang like a lunar glory, gently driven Across the many-coloured plains of Heaven, Until, as stars whose glittering toils are o'er, It sank into its place, and moved no more. Now, hearken to my story!—When I came First to this world, and saw the morning flame From the grey East, streaking the sky with bars Of light—(this while the shepherd of the stars, Great Lucifer, was busied in the West)— Imaginations strange perplexed my breast, Like ghosts some ancient house untenanted: And, after this, pale Learning sowed her seed Within my memory, and I became Such as I am. This, and no more, I claim From the remembrance of my childish time: Yet 'twas so like the period of my prime (The interval was nothing,—buried years Of boyhood,—idle, full of pains, and fears) That the first germ of what may never bloom Was born, it seems, in me,—a sweet perfume Clinging about my birth, and making still Those years seem sage,—not comprehensible To me or others; but 'tis often so; In budding, happiness is likest woe: Great thought is pain until the strengthen'd mind Can lift it into light: the soul is blind Until the suns of years have cleared away The film that hangeth round its wedded clay. Then Love came—Love!—How like a star it streamed In infancy upon me,—till I dreamed, And 'twas as pure and almost cold a light, And led me to the sense of such delight As children know not; so, at last I grew Enamoured of beauty and soft pain, And felt mysterious pleasure wander through My heart, and animate my childish brain; And thus I rose (for patient still was I And a true worshipper)—to poetry. Thou radiant spirit of the Muses! never Will I profane thee with adulterate rhyme: Love is thy theme, or Glory. Never, never Will I mix up the cavils of my time (Things of an instant, which a day disarms Of worth) or this my petty state's alarms, Or jealousies, or vulgar tricks of need, With ‘peerless Poesy,’—a poor base breed Are they, not children whom the stream of song Should clasp in its bright arms, as slow along It winds into Eternity. The theme Whereon my charmed spirit loves to dream Is thou,—Queen!—princess of that sunny throne Seated upon the waters, where alone The glory of the world is not a name: Even in Florence it is not the same; Yet here are woods and rivers, and the swell Of hills,—the pastoral mead, and lawny dell: But here lives not the Sea:—The ocean waters Wander not here, nor lash our sylvan ground, Making immortal noise, nor sound for sound Send back to our mountain echoes when the daughters Of the pine-forests shout in storm and gloom: And we have not thy skies, nor thy perfume Winging the azure air,—yet through green vales Our Arno runs, and where the slope prevails Clings with bright kisses, till the yielding earth Gives forth its coloured sweets, a cloudy birth! III. Now shall I pass unto my boyhood?—no: It is enough, perhaps, that thou shouldst know That time was mournful to me:—It is gone; And manhood like a radiant morning shone, And Beauty lit her lamps that I might see Intenser day: Then life was Heaven to me: My soul was perfected by passion,—pure As marble ere the Parian pierced the mine Wherein the carv'd Diana lay secure, Yet lovely as that shape which is divine Tho' mortal, being born and warmed to life By light as is the rainbow, (when the roar Of rain hath passed) which was but cloud before. I loved:—I tell thee thou art not the first (Tho' fairest) of the creatures of my love: For early did the floods of passion burst My veins and overwhelm me,—yet I strove Never to tamper with my nature then, Nor call back my desire into the den Wherein it had reposed for twenty years; For I had hope ('twas mixed I own with fears) That the strong lustre of my love would lead My thoughts unto their fountain springs, and feed My soul with light:—'Twas then I penned some tales Where Beauty is the bride and her son ever The God and master of my poor endeavour. O mistress! thou shalt read the tales I have writ, For love is there, and reason, and a wit Which though it be abandoned at its birth, And vanish for a time, shall rise again, And in remoter places of this earth Shall be a treasure to great men, Shakspeare, Beaumont and Fletcher. whose fame Shall be commingled with my lasting name, Co-heritors of bright futurity. O light of my Renown, I see thee on high! This is not vanity: it hath (bright faith!) Its birth in darkness as the Lightning hath, And yet it shall be seen from shore to shore, And heralded by spirits who shall soar On their own wings and mine unto the sky, Supremest poets, who can never die; For Genius, which looketh like the light Is as the earth eternal, and for aye Is busy with the brain, and still at night Breathes beauty on the poet as he lies In thought, and doth submit to be compressed, And languisheth or brighteneth as is best;— And so is verse conceived which never dies. IV. In youth, I read (with Cino) serious law, And should have read till now, but that I saw How dull and selfish the civilian's toil, Ne'er ranging from his desk unless to spoil; And then they placed a cowl upon my head; Ill change, and vain! for I was forest-bred, And loved to wander in mine infancy, And made a young acquaintance with the sky, With rocks and streams, rich fruits and blushing flowers, And fed upon the looks of Morning, when She parteth with the beauty of the Hours; And so I quitted the most holy men With whom I herded, and (thus willed my sire) I sought fair Florence:—Here I did aspire Unto a base renown, and gave my all Of passion to a faithless woman's thrall. I revelled; and (with riot and bright wine Mad) did assert that span of life divine, And shouted in the stern Carthusian's ear, (Who having learned his lesson taught me mine) “Love is but slavery and Faith a fear.” O shame! for then I knew not Love nor Faith: No knowledge of them had I more than hath He who is mute, or deaf, or blind from birth, Of speech or graceful motion. On the earth I lived as doth the hermit, who hath given His wisdom here away for hope of Heaven, And shut the fountains of his thought with prayer: So, misted by a strange voluptuous air, I travelled on in intellectual gloom, Forgetting the dull poison in perfume; But I awoke:—I saw a face as fair As Dian's,—or thine own; yet touched with care And pale, my princess,—tho' thy cheek is pale; And with eyes downcast,—thus do thine prevail; Her voice was silvered,—like my Naples' queen, And her hair braided as thine own hath been, When on some lamped feast, solely arrayed In thy own costly beauty, thou hast strayed (Like some white creature of the upper air) Amongst us, marvelling at sight so fair. This girl of whom I tell thee (—she is dead, And thou wilt anger not at what is said) I loved as I love thee. Less calm, perhaps, Was that regard than the one now which wraps My senses in its clear unchanging light; And yet it yielded me most great delight: But I was very young, and scarcely knew Love's quick gradations, tho' it fann'd and flew Round and around me, and my heart was fire, Until borne onwards by my wing'd desire I traversed an Elysium.— There may be Passion like mine,—as true, certain more free, But never was delight so large as mine When I lay panting at Olympia's feet, And she—she smiled! It was a smile heav'n-sweet,— Like Juno's when by Jove she did recline Clasped in the Cytherean zone. I sprung Into her arms and there bewildered hung On her red lip and gazed within her eye, Which turned and misted when my own was nigh: —Why do I tell thee this?—why, but because I love thee, and submit to all the laws Which the sweet tyranny of Love has sealed, And Truth is one,—and lo! I have revealed. V. When first I saw her—(young Olympia!) She lived not far from Florence. One may stray Unto the valley where her cottage stood On a bright morning, be the season good, Summer or latest spring: Her dwelling was Fenced round by trees which shatter'd the fierce air To fragments, pine and oak; and ash was there Which leaves its offspring berries to the grass, And citron woods that shook out vast perfume, And myrtles dowried with their richest bloom. There dwelt she, sylvan goddess!—there she first Swam on my sight: I thought my heart would burst With transport as I saw her float along Tow'rds me, and slowly read the carved song Which on the oaken rind my knife had writ: There was some idle praise, but more of wit Had grown and mingled with that forest verse, And I would often with a laugh rehearse The song, thinking at times that some weak maid Might love such incense if she thither strayed: But I was to be victim: I had gone Like an erratic fire upon my course, Over the Heaven of beauty, all alone, And now I felt Love's chaste and supreme force Press on my very heart, until in pain I utter'd consecrated vows,—in vain. —She perished in her youth; nor should I now Have told thus much, but that upon thy brow I saw forgiveness—('twas in fancy this) And smiles that recognized my vanished bliss As a thing risen from the grave, and bright As ever in the summer of thy sight. When pale Olympia died my heavy mind Grief-smitten languished to a deep eclipse; Yet brief, for I arose, half sorrow-blind, And on her marble-pale (but lovely) lips Laid the last benediction of true faith, And grew an alter'd man. Great misery hath A lustre in it, like the clouded moon, When, of her darkness unattired soon, She streams illuminating land and sea: So grief soon cast undazzling light on me; I saw the many faults, the many ills, The purer pleasures too that haunt sweet life, And I determined me to quit the strife And fever of rebellious joy, which fills The mind with dull oblivion and sad care, And scorn of all things here, gracious or fair. VI. Now will I tell thee how I kissed the air Of Naples, and first faced its visions fair,— Its blue skies and Palladian palaces, (Like Eastern dreams,)—statues and terraces, And columns lustrous with poetic thought; All filled with groups arrayed in antique dress, (Nymphs and Arcadian shapes, gods, goddesses) From base to palmy capital marble-wrought, And colonnades of marble, fountain-cool, Amongst whose labyrinthine aisles the breeze Roamed at its will, and gardens green, and trees Fruited with gold, and walks of cypresses, Where Revel held her reign (a gay misrule) Nightly beneath the stars. And there the seas Which wander in and out thy sunny bay, Soothe Ischia and the crowned Procida, Bright islands, with a thousand harmonies, Or answer with rich cries, from shore to shore, The anguish of the great Vesuvian roar, When that earth-tempest, scattering dust and fire From its red heart in torment, doth aspire To Heaven, as did an angel.—Many sights I saw, beneath the softest sun that lights The Italian world to morning, tho' thine earth Was then not teeming with its fiery birth, But lay in huge repose, outstretched far, Like a giant slain, or sad, or worn with war.— But wherefore do I lend to thoughts like these My perplex'd soul?—Thy calm-enchained seas Are nothing now: thy purple Appenines (Hither they stretch, clothed all with gloomy pines From head to foot) are nothing: Summer now Is nought; and Spring is gone; and Winter rears His head and shakes the frost-locks on his brow, And laughs at by-gone days and perish'd years: O days!—yet one is my perpetual care, Even now: I cannot lose that day so fair (It shineth as a precious diamond set In my poor round of thought) when first I met In the Cordélier church, thee,—like a dream— A fascination, into light or air Dissolving,—chaunting thy melodious theme. Ah, peerless princess! do not thou forget!— Oh! with what weary steps my feet had trod Street, square, and murmuring beech, and garden sod, Till harassed by the languor of the hour, I stole for refuge to thy church:—The power Of music was awake, and to the wind Just stirring, the most solemn organ pined, And spoke, and seemed in sorrow to complain, While, mingling with its mystic tones, a strain Of song fell dying from a priestess' lips,— Such song it was (so sweet) as must eclipse All sounds for ever. My dull spirit grew Brigh ter—more tranquil; and I paced through The stone-cold aisles and touched the altar steps: There saw I—what?—a vision! in the depths Of holy aspiration lost: Her eye— Thine eye—(oh! thine it was) journeyed on high Amongst the wondrous Heavens, with such a glance As might allure a seraph from his trance Of adoration, when the rebel king Passes the constellations, and dares fling Delusion in the eyes of angels bright. I saw thy soft eye wander, like a light Starry,—meteorous; at last it wept Rich, happy tears, and midst its lashes slept.— I stood—(how often have I told thee this!) Enchanted to a vague oblivious bliss, Like one who in a heedless hour hath drank Odours Circean, and brain-charmed sank Into some sweet futurity of joy:— He, waking from his dream, with sore annoy Feeleth that still he stands a thing world born, Heart-smitten, self-despised, alone, forlorn. Yet not thus I:—for, when my alarmed heart Turned, like a bird to some magician's spell, Tow'rd thee,—I saw thee still in beauty dwell Before me, with rais'd eyes,—silent,—apart, As though the sense of song would not depart. —At last, a fine and undulating motion, Like that of some sea-bloom which with the ocean Moveth, surprized thee in thy holy lair, And stole thee out of silence, lady fair! I saw thee go,—scarce touching the cold earth, As beautiful as Beauty at her birth, Sea-goddess, when from out the foam she sprung Full deity, and all the wide world hung Mute and in marvel at perfection born. I languish while I think of thee: The morn Was not more bright, nor balmy eve as soft, Nor music heard in dreams wandering aloft: Thy cheek outblushed the sunset, and thy hand— O white enchantment! I have read and scanned Its page, and tasted (once) its perfect bliss:— VII. Fair creature pardon! Those were happy days (Were not they, princess?) when within thy gaze I basked as doth a snake beneath the sun: —Yet, wherefore, after all that I have done Of folly, call me like the serpent grey, Which hath been wise esteemed from earliest day! I only on the flowers of thought have hung As yet, and I have not the adder's tongue, Nor am I wary as that creature is: Yet have I stolen from thee the poor bliss Of ignorance, and wedded thy fine mind To intellectual shapes and fancies bright, And taught thee to look at the dazzling light Of Truth, which striketh the dull sinner blind. We two have read together glorious rhyme Which Homer old and his great brothers writ, In Attica and Greece, and the world lit With Fame through everlasting thought and time.— And we have read my master Petrarch's lays, And fed his learned lamp with words of praise Whereat he kindly smiled. Gracious is he: (Like a good spirit hath he been to me, A light in the perilous dark;) his soul is full Of all that is wise and great and beautiful, And wheresoever, princess, thou shalt go, Wear thou his well-lamented songs of woe Close to thy soul:—to mine they are a calm; A shadow to my passion,—(like the palm Which hangeth cool above the Indian's brow:) A fountain where my brain may bathe its fever: A refuge which is sure and tireth never; And to my wounded thought sweet and perpetual balm. Would I might call unto thy heart the hours, Those pleasant hours, when we roamed so free, Listening and talking by the Naples' sea! Or gathering from thy father's gardens flowers To braid thy hair on some feast-coming night:— Oh! still most dear are those gone hours to me; Yet dearer those when at the young eve-light, Seated familiar near thy cedar tree, We watched the coming moon, and saw how she Journeyed above us on her sightless track, And chased with serene looks the fleecy rack, Or smiled as might the huntress-queen of Heaven Floating, attended by her starry court, O'er plain and mountain where their shadowy sport Is again revealed,—or when all passion-driven, Leaving the azure moors she seeks her way Through cloud and tempest and the peal'd alarms Of thunder, and the lightning's quivering wrath, Guided by Love unto the Latmian's arms.— Oh! so wast thou by love and duty guided, And we were ruled by thee; for each one prided Himself upon obedience,—not in vain, For thou wast as a virtue without stain, A visible perfection shining clear, A creature fairer than man worships here. —Mammon is worshipped here, an idol base; And Belial, cozener, (varnished round with grace And smiling sin)—and the blood-hungry God Black Moloch, whose large stained feet have trod Temples down to the dust and holy towers, And ravaged the green fields and peasants' homes, And filled the river wheresoe'er it roams And the great Sea with gore: The forests deep He hath cursed, and startled from their innocent sleep And cast upon their tops his red rain showers; And he hath killed the oak that stood for ages To bear his slaughters on the ocean wide, And he hath torn the books of saints and sages, And struck the house of Science in his pride, And drained the widow of her refuge tear, (The last) and bade the young bride live alone, And mocked the sire's grey hairs, the orphan's moan:— Fierce war, in whatsoever shape he comes A curse—Bellona-like, or fiery-red, Or like a comet staring kingdoms dead,— Or heralded by steeds and stormy drums, Blood and the fear of death and pennons flying, And close behind the murdered dead, and dying, Insolent ever,—hateful in all hues Figures and mocks and signs wherewith the Muse Hath hid him from the execrating world; Whether with flashing arms and flags unfurl'd He stands outnumbering the thick leaves at noon, Or sends his trumpets braying at the moon, Or runs from rank to rank, like courage caught From victors grey by those who never fought:— But thou—O princess! thou wast born to save The frail world from oblivion. Thou didst give A light more lovely than did ever live On earth or the wide waters, or in air, Or such as are upon the blue sky lying, To lift low passion from its brute despair, And save the poetry of love from dying. I thought that beauty was a fable, framed To enchant the soul of boyhood into day, Lest it should lie in slumbers dark alway; I thought that life would such chained dreams dissever; But thou didst shine upon me:—I was shamed And struck to adoration dumb, for ever. Thou wonder of the earth! fable or dream Never entranced like thee: no thought, nor theme, Vision however wild nor loneliest mood, Imagination, with her airy brood Of spirits that go mad beyond the stars (But here are chained and fettered by the bars Of earthly things too palpable)—ev'n She Cannot from out her empire wide and free Call up a beauty beautiful like mine:— I kiss thee from the distance, Queen divine! VIII. Why did I lose thee?—Wherefore was I sent (Gently, 'tis true) away to banishment, With such a passion clinging to my soul?— I cannot tell thee half its huge controul, Its fiery folly,—its so proud despair, Its scorn,—aye of itself; nay, scorn of thee! Dost thou not marvel how such things should be? They were; but I am well;—and yet not thine! . . . And thou hast passed from me!—Do I repine?— I ask my heart in vain;—it answereth not. My soul hath but one sight:—It looks alone Into the future, and the past which shone So bright is now (save some few dreams) forgot. —A change now as I write is happening. My mind doth re-assume its strength, and fling Away Hate, Envy, Melancholy,—blind Errors which hung like clouds upon my mind, And now I stand strong and with new born power Arrayed, fit champion for a darker hour; My sight is piercing bright: my reason free, Unfettered, even by love for thee:— Yet often, methinks, as I lie pondering Under the evening boughs at sunset pale, I hear thee,—like that strange voice wandering Amongst the vernal thickets, ere winds bring Perfume from roses or across the vale Enchantments come from the lost nightingale, Before the morn-fed lark her matin weaves, Or the thrush whistles, or the stock-dove grieves, I hear thee,—sweeter than all sounds that be; I see thee, too, waving along:—I see Thy black Italian glances, and they flash Amorous delight upon me, till I dash My burning forehead in the fringed stream, And then I find thee (what thou art)—a dream! This frets me, shakes me; but at last I rise Emboldened by the pain, and through the skies All starry tracking my sublunar way, Utter,—as poets used when Pindus lay Open to Heavenly ears, and verse was strong With fate and peril,—some prophetic song.— CONCLUSION. Farewell!—The bars which hang around our prison Are nigh dissolved: The sun hath set and risen Again, and flung new morning on my world. The aspect of the future is all wonder: Innocuous lightnings, unallied to thunder, Are every where in sport lustrously hurled. A Vision of the Deep, of Earth and Heaven, Is opened on me,—and my sight is driven Amongst the tombs and towers of men to be: Eternity flows back with all her fountains, And scythed Time lays bare the horizon mountains, That hide the world to come even from thee. I see a Paradise where peerless flowers Laugh in perpetual light, and crystal bowers Fashioned for lovers whispers always sweet; And rich pavilions by the green woods shaded, And airy shapes whose bows are violet-braided, And forest walks trodden by delicate feet. I see the lion and the lamb together, The white dove hiding by the falcon's feather, And the fierce vulture near his victim lie: I see the peasant and the prince adorning Equality and peace: I hear the warning Of Earth, loud-telling her futurity. I see the Deep, and midst its caverns hoary, Gold, helmets, statues, famous once in story, And jewels brighter than in Ormus' mine: I see the shadows of the Deep (its daughters) Floating afar amongst the azure waters, Or streaming by my eyes in dance divine. And in the air I see illustrious treasures (On summits higher than the eagle measures) Of amethystine light, and rainbow shapes; And voices touch my ear, like running rivers When first the Spirit of the Spring delivers The world, and Winter like a dream escapes. And now, a cloud, so vast no thought may span it, Comes travelling on, and—as when some huge planet Doth deluge the next orb with black eclipse, It overshadoweth the world: Its hour Is come—is gone, like the wild Bacchant's power, Who dies with the bright frenzy on her lips.— —'Tis past:—and the wide scenes are gone for ever: The past like some slow-fading lamp doth quiver: And in the present only doth my soul Live, like a spirit,—by the tempest shaken, Yet full of that bright strength that shall awaken The world from error, and its blind controul.— Farewell!—Ever the same, thy friend, thy lover, Boccaccio liveth. Though the wide world over Fate shall exile him, yet no change shall bend His courage, or resolving firmly taken: But, though by every friend and hope forsaken, Still shall Boccaccio be thy hope, thy friend. Thy home lies far away: but every feature Of thy soft beauty, thou imperial creature, Within my heart of hearts will I retain: Thy fortunes and mine own are far divided; Thine to a throned chair, by duty guided, Shines fair—Away, unto the sunny Spain! Perhaps, with somewhat of my old emotion, My eye may glance at times across the ocean, And through the cloud-fed billows when they flee To Heav'n, and through the phantom-peopled ether, I may behold thee still,—wandering hither An exile from thy olive shores,—to me. And should I see thee on the amorous waters Treading with white feet bare, as once the daughters Of wing'd magicians could by some fine spell, I'll clasp thee, beauty of the world!—though madness Rain down, or dazzling death, or endless sadness Cling like remorse to me.—Farewell, farewell!— THE FALL OF SATURN. A VISION. THIS VISION OF THE FALL OF SATURN IS INSCRIBED TO CHARLES LAMB BY HIS ADMIRER AND SINCERE FRIEND THE AUTHOR. Good Friend! whose spirit, like an April day, Is full of change,—bright flashes and some rain, Fantastic, gay,—yet gentle more than gay, And rich and deep as in the populous main, Take—(if thou wilt)—my song. I build my fame Beneath the shadow of thy rising name, (Which shall not pass away while wit shall be,) Proud to associate my verse with thee. I dream—I dream—I dream— Of shadow and light,—of pleasure and pain, Of Heaven,—of Hell.—And visions seem Streaming for ever athwart my brain. The present is here, and the past that fled So quick, is returned with its buried dead, And the future hath bared its scrolls of fame, And I see the ‘is’ and the ‘was’ the same, In spirit alike, but changed in name. I see the phantoms of Earth and Air, A thousand are foul where one is fair, (But that ‘one’ is divine, and her blue eyes calm Are shadowed by leaves of the branching palm,) And I hear the yells of a million more, Whose sins are all written in stripes and gore:— There's one who the gem of his best friend stole,— And a King half-hid in a beggar's soul, And a Poet who lied for his earthly good, And a Woman of glass, and a God of wood, (Wrapped round like the idol-beast that treads With murderous scorn on the Hindoos' heads)— I see a Palace—enormous—bright, Studded with stars like an August night; The pillars that prop it are based below, But whence they come or whither they go Who, with an eye like ours, shall know!— The shafts are embossed and golden, and graven With letters of Earth and Hell and Heaven, (A terrible mixture,—like the speech Of the Sea when it bursts on a stormy beach:) There are discord—melody—music,—hung Like beads on a rosary oddly strung, And words of a mighty forgotten tongue:— There are lessons to curse and a few to bless, And riddles beyond the Sphinx's guess; And folly, and passion, and proud despair, And all moods of the mind are sculptured there: —The shafts are of gold, and they run so high That they pierce the floors of the far blue sky, And a million of creatures, whose size is a span Climb round and around them, and each is—man: All toil, some rise, some hang in the air, And some fall with a shriek in a terrible lair, Which yawns like the pit of the damn'd, or a cave Where the brutes of the wilderness hunger and rave. Fierce flames are up-rising, and rain is descending, And o'er all the cloud-black Heaven is bending, And the insolent winds are unloos'd from their den, To hiss their scorn in the ears of the men, Who drop like leaves, when but few do hang On the blight smitten boughs:—Hark! a trumpet rang Through my brain; and, behold, all the pillars crack, And the star-studded palace is gone to rack: It totters—it falls—with a human scream Like the whirlwind's cry.—'Tis—an empty dream. A dream?—what is it—a birth or death Of thought?—'Tis whatever the poet saith: A figure (a prophecy) dark or dumb, Yet breathing a tale of the vast ‘to come,’— A fable,—a fact,—a cloud unfurled From all that was done in the last good world, And in truth as alarming as Plato's fear (Or hope) of that mighty embracing year, Within whose perilous grasp old Time Should return, pulled back by his locks sublime, And the Earth should gape, and the urns spice-fed, Should give up (just as they were) the dead. I dream—I dream—I dream:— A waking fancy now becomes my theme. I dream of pleasures old, And of the age of gold, When every river ran a happy stream; Before “The Syrian” raged: Before red wars were waged; Before a hero fought or Fame was born; Before the stars were shamed, Or men each other blamed For deeds the frowning night beheld in scorn. And now—I see as in some magic glass Radiant enchantments:—First, far streaming bright, Dazzling the shining earth with looks of light, A figure like a God: He seems to pass From Heaven to Heaven, and from star to star, Till all the depths and darkened worlds afar Rise up apparell'd in his joyful ray; And wheresoe'er he treads Pale planets rear their heads, And wheresoe'er he smileth—lo! 'tis day. But on what lonely mountain bare and old Sitt'st thou beyond the sun,—paternal king? Why look'st thou, with large eyes so blank and cold, As though the eternal year were on the wing? Why at thy feet are they, the Titan brood, Like brown leaves of the autumn strewed? In mute enormous anguish lo! they lie:— No wind nor sullen sound That shakes the barren ground Can stir them from their trance. A wake, or die! The Sun now blazes overhead: Below, A river filled with ruin and half hid, But terrible as Ocean at his flow, Rushes along:—Palace and pyramid Gray with the spoils of years, and mighty towers That cost the Titans (all) a thousand hours Of toil to build them to the cloudy Heaven, Are rent, and tumble in the stream, With their dark masters, while a scream Runs thro' the earth, as tho' its inmost heart was riven. And thou—Imperial terror!—Eldest-born! Hoary Saturnus!—thou whom Heaven and Earth Flung from their rich embrace, as the dim morn Sprang from the grave of night, a mingled birth, Half light, half darkness, yet like both sublime,— Awake! Arise! Else shall thou, ancient Time, Father of many years, be swept away, And no bright record left That the young world wept When thou the Patriarch sank before usurping day! He falls, he falls; His ancient reign is over: And on his neck a golden chain is laid, And on his eye an eye Darts like the blinding sun; and in his ears Sounds like the morn, terrible harmonies, Rage, as the ocean rages Beneath the eclipsing moon. Silence is gone: and Night, Glittering with terror, for the first time bares Her star-bewildered face, and strangely smiles; And the winds laugh aloud; and every pore Of the blue air stung with a radiant life Drops sweets; and nodding forests lose their gloom; And twilight caves are shining Set round with splendours like the set of suns: And Music (which had perish'd) is born again; And like a bird new-wakened in the night Uttereth her liquid notes, from spangled streams And fountains,—till the leaves are touched to tears; And every valley sinks writhing with joy; And every hill aspires, Ambitious to behold a new born God. Saturn alone (Heaven's king and Earth's) with scorn Looks on the time; and with impetuous strength Tears his harmonious bonds and golden chains, And spurning, with a shout, the obsequious ground, Invades the shrinking air. —He rises, like a ruin, Loosen'd by earthquakes from its deep foundations, And hung in the days of plague O'er some bad city, whose wide streets are thronged With millions, stained with death, yet fearing woe. How, if he so descend?— He springs,—he rises: His course is like the comet's, fierce and bright:— So the death-hunted serpent, crowned with wrongs, Springs from the reeds of Nile:—So that vast snake Strong as a tempest, that lays waste whole lands, Darts, like a wrath, from out his Asian haunts, And gripes the groaning lion till he dies. He rushes thro' the air: the sullen air Avoids him, and his wings, out-spread in vain, Flap on the void. His strength departs:—he falls.— As some brave swimmer whom the waves o'ermatch Looks far to land—in vain, So doth the aged Saturn's starting eye Glare on the faithless sky its red reproach, Its first,—its last. The fiery Phœbus Sheds all his ire on that unsheltered brain. He falls; and not a voice From Earth or Heaven is heard to speak for him: No tears (tho' false) are shed: no heart is touched With human anguish for a God dethroned. He falls,—he falls—he falls, Ten thousand fathoms down, And the dusky crown Is stripped for ever from his kingly brow. His son?—His son is King! Hark!—the Heavens ring: Jove is elected Lord of life and woe: His thunders speak; his lightnings come and go: His pomps are all around; Bright light and mighty sound Attend him, and his radiant armies flow Like rivers round the throne; He is God alone. And where is Saturn?—On what silent shore Doth he lament his wrongs and old exile? In what dull woods whereon no Summers smile, And all the Springs (if any were) are o'er? Where Autumn and her bounty are not known; Where Winter pineth for his icy crown, And the long year, breathing one endless sigh, Stripped of the seasons hath not learned to die?— —Saturn the king is gone:—perhaps in vain He howleth to the heedless winds his pain. No matter:—Such great end Is surely worth a friend: The Father falls,—but, look! the Son doth reign! O Saturn, fallen king! Older than the firmament:—Before the Sun, Before the Moon, before the glittering Stars Thou wast;—and art thou gone!— Oh! could I with my verse Stay thy chained ruin, Strait I would rehearse, Though my own undoing Followed, as the night Followeth the bier of the pale twilight. But, ah! in vain, in vain! Down-smitten by the sun's Rays, immortal pain Through thy furrows runs, Like the fierce quick lightning, When the storm is brightening. And tears, as from huge fountains Where the Sea is nursed, Spring,—and lo! the mountains, Moan until they burst: The great throne that bore thee Shrinks to dust before thee. Every thing that ‘was’ Pines its life away; So shall all things pass Which have birth to-day: What is joy or sorrow But—To-day—To-morrow? Life shall re-assume Its peculiar birth: Though it seek the tomb, It shall seek the earth Again; and like a star, Or as angels are, Winged with etherial beauty fair and free, Shall through finer regions flee, More bright, more soft, more green; Than ever here were seen In Tempe's valley or Idalian groves, Yet there the Cretan doves Sang to the silent branches without fear, And not a voice was near Save her's who for the boy Narcissus sighed, And, too much loving, died. Love in etherial light cannot outrave Its strength, nor perish from excess of scorn: But, like the zephyr to the wild sea-wave,— Like echo to sweet music,—like the morn, Whose pearl-bright sorrow doth the leaves adorn, It giveth strength and grace. Its boundless range Is all the blue dominion of the sky; It cannot pass away; it cannot change; But like the perfum'd ether spreads its power O'er the celestial vales and azure hills, And with immaculate passion stirs and fills All hearts, while Beauty—the eternal dower Of Heaven, grows brighter still thro' each transcendant hour. Here, on this dusty earth, perhaps the Spirit Of Love may droop, or soil its radiant wings: Perhaps a—something it may chance inherit Of what is around:—and yet the bird that sings In prison learneth a melodious strain, And often its sweetest song is born of pain. So, in the land of sorrows, Love may shine, Thro' clouds—thro' tears perhaps, yet still divine, Divine as beauty—as the light of truth, And fed with passion and immortal youth, And music, like some white enchanted bird In old times on Arabian waters heard. Oh! then Imagination was a God, And on the world with radiant steps he trod, And every leaf he touched, and every hue He glanced on became bright, and all was true: And still—as soft as fable, Nature sings Still in the shadowy woods and haunted springs: And birds at break of morn still wake the sun, And some (more sweet) still chaunt when day is done; And some the night wind witch with amorous sighs: Only the swan is mute—until it dies. —No more—no more—no more. The hour of dream is o'er; And troubles of the world bloom out anew; But youth—and sunny day— And beauty—where are they?— The earth has lost its green; the sky its blue. No more with pastoral pipe Shall I, when the year is ripe, (Falling in golden showers, and odorous drops Red as the ruby's light) Solace the pale twilight:— Alas! the melancholy music stops. In vain the reed is blown: No sorrows save her own, The watery Syrinx will allow to rise; But,—as tho' Pan still woo'd, And she again (pursued) Fled o'er the amorous shallows,—so she sighs. She sighs—like winds at eve, Like lovers' tongues that grieve, Like tones—oh! never to be heard again, Like voices from the sea Where the sea-maids be, Like aught of pleasure with a touch of pain. A more melodious tune Never beneath the moon Was uttered, since the Delphian girls were young, And the chaste Dian, bright With beauty and delight, Lay listening on the mountains, while they sung. A more entrancing song Was never borne along The ethereal sky, when at gray opening morn The fiery horses rise, Like victors from the skies, Trampling the stars away till day is born.— —Alas!—no more may I, Pale Syrinx, sigh for sigh Give thee:—Complaining not my song I cease.— —A spirit came and led My soul amongst the dead, And vanish'd. What is left,—but silence—peace?— THE GENEALOGISTS. A FRAGMENT. TO THOMAS HOOD, ESQ. I Two China-men, some thousand years ago, Lived by, on, at, or near the Yellow River: The name of one was Phang, and t'other's Foh, And both (but 'twas in China) were deemed clever: Some said, indeed, that Phang was rather slow, Yet sure to do his best in each endeavour: Others averred that Foh was like the sun, (Not bright, but quick)—you wished?—your wish was done. II Now, Phang—(the slow man) was by taste and trade A joiner, making chairs, stools, tools, and all Those things; and Foh an artist, ready made, Who painted doors and pictures, great and small, Signs, symbols, likenesses, both man and maid, Making the crooked straight, the little tall: He painted quick, and cheap, and didn't cozen, And always gave in thirteen to the dozen. III Phang had an only child,—a youth—a son; Not like the Chinese things we see in town, Poor wandering drones, on whom a frightful sun Has cast its common kitchen colours down; But slim, genteel, tho' not averse to fun, And o'er his back a tail hung half-way down. He was a beau, in short; his face was fair, And quite uncopper'd, which is curious there. IV Copper's an odious colour—for a face: It courts (but never answers) observation; Tho' I can't say that it reflects disgrace As is supposed by some more serious nation: I only mean, one might supply its place (Suiting our age, of course, or the occasion) With white or carmine, or some other hue, Pink, brown, or anything, in short,—but blue. V Blue—but I must not wander from my track: I left off with, I think, Phang's ‘only child,’ A hero with a tail half down his back, At which the ladies of his country smiled, Sighed, furled their fans, unfurled, and made 'em crack:— (The pretty souls are easily beguiled: A tail in China, and a sash and sabre Here, save young gentlemen a world of labour.) VI The name of this Adonis was—but reader, You must not think the East and West the same: There Love is led, and here he is a leader; Here beauty is a boast, and there a blame; In England with warm sighs, wild words we feed her; In China they prefer her cold and tame. By this, I mean to say—the Chinese notion Differs from ours on this side of the ocean. VII The name of this Adonis was—Chang-ho, Only sixteen, yet he was quite a man: He loved the daughter of the painter Foh, And talk'd—(that is, as well as dandies can; Their talk at best is trashy, and below Man's level,—reaching but the blockhead's span.) He talked as lover should who love discloses, Likening her neck to snow, her lips to roses. VIII They met in secret. Through the azure hours Of night they changed soft vows and kisses sweet; And swore by all the heavenly (Chinese) powers, They would, upon the feast of lanthorns, meet:— (Their lanthorns, by the bye, are not like ours, But made of paper, oil'd, and very neat: The feast is like our holy annual dinners, Frequented equally by saints and sinners.) IX They met upon the feast of Lanthorns,—pale As possible (in China) looked the maid: Chang-ho, in yellow boots and plaited't ail, Met her, half-fond and more than half afraid. The lady who came first began to rail; (And ladies, as we well know, can upbraid): On which Chang-ho swore out, by Fum and Fo-am! He wished to Gad, that he had stayed at home. X This led to some discussion:—How it ended I leave all folks who know the sex to guess. He kissed her,—once; she vowed she was offended: Another,—she was angry still,—but less. He then said that he loved; but, if she blended Such acids with her sweets, why she must bless Some happier man—(Our phrases are crratic— Erroneous I should say—when we're emphatic.) XI —They met upon the feast of Lanthorns. Love! In thy dominion are not lovers' eyes Enough to guide them?—can they elsewhere rove Save to each others arms?—Old sacrifice! (Of time and lanthorns) is not Heaven above 'Shamed of its lustre by thy lights and lies,— Thy scandals,—wonderings,—about Fum and Ho, And all thy stupid wooden kings below?— XII I hate all folly,—fuss: I hate pretence 'Bout ‘honour,’ ‘heart,’ and ‘gentlemen,’ and ‘station,’— And all that sort of thing. I hate that men's Poor noughts should thus be thrust on observation:— For me, I don't believe 'em—(no offence!) Better a bit for all such protestation. I think that men are bad, and women good, And both—I mean in China, made of wood. XIII Tho' here I may be wrong: the wood may be But in the head; the body may be pliant, And flesh,—it must be so, and pretty free, Else how could Chinese lawyer round his client Twist (while a ducat 's there) his gripe, and be Like Hercules about the earth-born giant? How could they dye cups,—saucers,—or paint stucco? Or pick our sailors' pockets of tobacco? XIV Yet now my logic's bad:—the thing is plain:— I've drawn a false conclusion:—I confess it. This owning costs me to be sure some pain; Tho' none perhaps but modest men would guess it; And yet the fault of which I here complain, Might have been hidden, had I chose to dress it In looser words, and made a large conclusion;— But I forgot the thing in my confusion. XV But to return;—and, now I think on't, I Have quite forgotten to describe the lady: Her name was Fohi, a brunette, and nigh A black; her eyelashes were long and shady; And 'neath them did she peer—prim, shrewish, sly:— And did Chang-ho know this?—Why I'm afraid he Did not: for Fohi seemed as she had twice his Small stock of virtue, but without his vices. XVI Her little feet, were cabined and confined In swathes of linen, fine, and white, and thin; And as her feet were prisoned so her mind, Her studies ending where our girls' begin. She knew a few words, such as ‘Men’, ‘Mankind’, ‘Love’, ‘beauty’, ‘tea’, ‘toys’, ‘virtue’, ‘woman’, ‘sin’: But nothing more. Her looks were human faces: She read, and put them in their proper places. XVII Midst others came Chang-ho's—a blank; without A single letter upon any page: And why 'twas ever made might cause some doubt. I certainly might guess;—I might engage To give the depth, perhaps, of any lout, Beau, beast, or blockhead, with unerring guage: But after all 'twould be like some disaster Of birth, or wood-cut by a German master. XVIII And what is that?—what's any night mare worth, Except by Fuseli?—A leg of veal, A ham, a pig, a pudding ('neath the girth) Such things, and better, to our sleep reveal: Some are of hell, 'tis said, and some of earth, And some are like—(for why should I conceal The fact?)—our friends; who ride us in the dark, And spur us thro' the day with some remark. XIX Whate'er Chang-ho and Fohi were, is not Our task. They loved—or thought—or said they did; They kissed, and swore to share each other's lot, And do whatever not their parents bid: They vowed they wouldn't have a secret thought, And then, as usual, all their secrets hid. In fine, Chang-ho declared he'd manage so As soon to get the full consent from Foh. XX But Foh, though wild and hasty in some things, Thought much of birth, as we shall perceive soon; (Like German barons, or dull Spanish kings, Who think that high birth is a heavenly boon:) And—for some folly to the wisest clings— Traced, as he said, his fathers to the moon; And much of her bright madness could one trace,— Tho' really not her beauty, in his face. XXI Foh's face was large, coarse, hard, and squarely cut; His red-brown cheeks like pears that housewives bake; And through his brow a wrinkle like a rut Ran, and beneath, two eyes—like what the snake Shows when its prey is near, half-ope, half-shut, Twinkled,—or like a young star just awake: His ears were wide: his beard was long: His tail!— But no—I wont attempt it—I must fail. XXII I'll paint his mind—his soul; for I suppose They have those things in China as in Britain. They've eyes, ears, mouth, and something like a nose, And a language bigger than was ever written; Whether it has much wisdom in't, God knows! Or freedom,—for no poor wretch e'er was smitten Enough to learn:—We'll grant 'em wise and free; Altho' I chiefly know them by—their tea. XXIII His mind was like a windmill; round and round It went—and went—and went, from day to day, And never reached the sky nor touched the ground, But folly-blown was tossed about, mid-way, Or else amid a cloud of projects bound: And so he lived,—(not wisely, by the way,)— A bubble, or a blow-ball,—fashion,—fame, So they were idle all, were all the same. XXIV Constant to nothing but the moon, and then Tracking her course—‘his’ course I should say, rather, For Foh believed the planets all were men, And that the moon, in fact, was his own father, Although but little of the ‘where’ and ‘when’ Could possibly be known, by which to gather So strange a notion,—(but I before said That he had curious notions on that head.) XXV —Thou huntress, who upon cerulean plains Followest the stars, and with cold arrows bright Dost pierce the green earth tho' it ne'er complains, Because it worshippeth thy beauty. Night! See how a beggar, here, thy sex arraigns. Are all the poets wrong, and he aright? Sweet Dian, art thou wronged by painter Foh? Give me a speedy answer;—‘yes’ or ‘no?’— XXVI —These goddesses in truth are somewhat odd:— I waited for an answer full a minute. I've half a mind to ask her brother god: He has an ear, if I could hope to win it. I'm told some poets in his house have trod: I wonder whether there 's a parlour in it— I wonder where he dines,—I wonder whether He sits or stands,—or eats and drinks together: XXVII I wonder—no: I'll wonder nothing more At aught above the moon or aught that 's under; Unless it be, standing on some wild shore, To mark the curling billows burst in thunder, Or hear the burning mountain howl and roar As though 'twould split its own fierce heart asunder, While far below the ashes crack and burn, Precisely where you came,—and must return. XXVIII That trembling of the ground beneath one's feet, As tho' 'twould swallow all in its red fury, Is terrible; 'twould stretch a nerve of steel, To be thus buried without judge or jury: The thing is not fictitious, Sir, but real, A truth, a fact, and this I do assure you: I learnt it (for I own I'm no unraveller Of Nature's secrets) from a friend—a traveller. XXIX This traveller (whom I know, and know no coward) A short time since went up the flaming cone, O'er dust, and lava rocks, and rivers dowered With death, and on the summit lay alone Midst the black ashes, whilst the crater showered Its wrath, and there he heard the mountain groan, And bellow like a creature racked with pain, And sigh and moan like one who grieves in vain. XXX Oh! that Vesuvian beast—whose mouth is full Of fire, whose breath is like the furnace blast; What was the Ilian horse, or what the bull (The brazen horror) that Perillus cast; What is the kraken's splash, or the strange dull Cry of the crocodile when Nile has past By with his floods and left his slimy veins Bare to the—thing (what is it?) that complains! XXXI It utters its red shouts, and all the shores And hills and plains—the vallies—the tost ocean, Shake like a wild stag when the lion roars; And mighty forests totter in their emotion: The shuddering billow lifts its head and pours Its white strength out,—as tho' it had no notion Whither it went, nor care:—the vast noise drowns The laugh of cities, and the strife of towns. XXXII Slowly and slowly a bright river runs Down the dark mountain's side, and takes its way— Companioned by quick shocks like minute guns, To where a little village lies,—or lay, Till at the last, light like a thousand suns Singes the wind, and bursts abroad like day Trebled, thrice trebled—a hundred times—In brief Beyond all calculation or belief. XXXIII And still the river runs, and still the ground Shakes as in travail; and the vineyard leaves Grow black and wither with a crackling sound, And here and there some cottage upward heaves Itself and falls; and nought is heard around But cries of women, and the curse of thieves, Who amidst plagues and earthquakes always plunder. (—How they can pilfer then to me 's a wonder!) XXXIV Hark! to those noises,—like the rush of cars And lashing thongs, and countless rattling wheels, As though deep earth were shook by ruinous wars Within, while every flaring blast reveals Bubbles all o'er the sea as thick as stars, And wide-rent chasms yawn till the sick sense reels, And rivers are sucked in, and marshes rise,— And still the cloudless blue is in the skies. XXXV But now Ocean begins to roar:—Its deeps (Hitherto hid) are opened, and light fills The caverns where the lazy sea-horse sleeps, Who startled from his trance comes up and swills Enormous waves in fear,—the dolphin leaps Out of his element, and from the hills The beasts run howling, while the darkened sun Frowns as though Earth had lost and Hell had won. XXXVI —And still the river runs. At last it stops, Huddled and massed, against some fence or wall, Piling its strength until the ruin drops, And then another, and then others fall, Then gardens, houses, trees, the blushing crops Of grapes, and corn; for nothing seems to pall The appetite of fire, until it hies Into the hissing sea,—and there it dies. XXXVII But to resume—for really after all it Will never do and cannot be defended, This—this digressing, or whate'er you call it, Where foreign stuff with homespun thus is blended; There may, and will, and must, some ill befall it, Unless the system be soon dropped and ended: If it go on there'll soon be, (there the bore is,) No middle, and what's worse, no end to stories. XXXVIII So to resume—O beauty! O the light, The love of women when they 're true—and young! Their smile 's like morning and their eyes like night! And that ambrosian bloom about them flung, Rich as a rosy sunset, when the light Is passing, and the vesper bell has rung 'Mongst the white Alps!—(the hue I mean is rose, A blush—but pink, as every body knows.) XXXIX What is there like sweet women,—like their bloom, Their necks outshaming the white dove's in whiteness, Their small words hallowed by such fine perfume, And their eyes flashing forth such fearful brightness As might the heaviest blockhead well illume, And make him tread like Zephyr in his lightness, Their look, their lips, their clasp—Oh! thrilling touch, Soft as—but really, I shall say too much. XL So I'll return to Foh:—Well, Foh was proud: Not of his pallets, nor his paintings, no: Such pride was poor, he said,—(This was aloud, And therefore somewhat odd that I should know, For secrets are the things to catch the crowd, And a whisper travels miles where nought would go, Save but a lie:—that beats it by some perches: I've heard it tried in playhouses and churches.) XLI Yes, he was proud:—‘My only daughter,’ said he, ‘My Fohi, my sweet darling,’ (here he wept) ‘I hope to Ho’ (which means to Gad) ‘you're steady: ‘For if not,—and some tales have hither crept,— ‘Your friends have whispered—yes, I know they're ready ‘To waken stories that had better slept— ‘I know all that, my darling:—but I know, ‘That if you wed Phang's son my name's not Foh.’ Oh! Fohi, gentle Fohi,—art thou bowed By misery,—mad,—distract,—a broken flower? A China-aster covered by a cloud? Thy vapours—did they pass in sigh and shower? Thy anger—was it long and rather loud? Thy love—a taper lit to last an hour?— Blown to and fro by sobs, and snuffed by doubt, And damped by scorn,—it hissed and then went out. LII And when 'twas dead, and when her grief was ended, (Some fifteen minutes, by the Pekin clocks, It ran away in tears) like one offended By what had given her heart such shocking shocks, She turned to spite from sorrow, and so blended Her self-reprovings with such merry mocks, That some believed she feigned, and some that strong Passion had made her mad,—but they were wrong. LIII She was but (what girls are too often)—fickle; Easily moved without or with a reason.— Oh! would ye thrive, ye desperate lovers, tickle Your mistress' vanity, and in due season Water your words with tears; but let the sickle Spare the gaunt folly-heards, and by degrees on You'll get high as her heart,—that crockery shelf, And there find fifty figures like yourself: LIV A shepherd, with his crook half-bent (through age); An Alderman in liquor from Portsoken, A soldier with his breast-plate crack'd;—a Sage Who turns his leaves in vain for some love-token; A dandy, ‘formed,’ as bards say, ‘to engage,’ Mending his manners while his bones are broken; A dwarf, in body under height, and blind; An officer of sappers—under mind: LV There may be seen the miser, sad but sly, Letting his yellow gods at discount go, (Coin for bare kisses); and the poet shy Turning his gold to love, his notes to woe; The high priest with the tenth pig o' the stye; His amorous notions can no farther go; If he succeeds, 'tis well—the pig 's forsaken, And if he fails, at least ‘he saves his bacon.’ LVI Fohi had lovers, though, ‘she never told Her love,’ to any, save the joiner's son, To whom she languished to be joined of old; And now she called them over, one by one, How she made sad the gay, and tamed the bold, And with the gamester played at hearts and won; And conquered cannoneers with bead-black glances; And mowed down crops (of fools) at routs and dances. LVII Which should she choose?—Duke Han she feared had pride, And though he flattered well, he might not wed: Old Thong was palsy-struck from side to side, And clumsy country Ching-ti too ill-bred: The shaking Ho-ang she could not abide— That very Mandarin from heel to head, That thing, patch'd, painted, made of cork and wire, Old (and almost as ugly) as her sire. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. BABYLON, WITH THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR. Many a perilous age hath gone, Since the walls of Babylon Chained the broad Euphrates' tide,— (Which the great king in his pride Turned, and drained its channel bare)— Since the Towers of Belus square (Where the solid gates were hung That on brazen hinges swung) Mountain sized, arose so high That their daring shocked the sky. Famous city of the earth, What magician gave thee birth?— What great prince of sky or air Built thy floating gardens fair? —Thee the mighty hunter founded: Thee the star-wise king surrounded With thy mural girdle thick Of the black bitumen brick,— Belus, who was Jove, the God: He who each bright evening trod On thy marble streets, and came Downwards like a glancing flame, Love-allured, as fables tell. But the last who loved thee well Was the king whose amorous pride (All to please his Median bride) Fenced thee round and round so fast, That, while the crumbling earth should last, Thou, he thought, should be, and Time Should not spoil thy look sublime. He is gone, whose spirit spoke To him in a golden dream: He who saw the future gleam On the present, and awoke Troubled in his princely mind, And bade his magicians blind From their eyelids strip the scale, And translate his hidden tale:— He is gone: but ere he died, He was tumbled from his pride, From his Babylonian throne, And cast out to feed alone, Like the wild ox and the ass, Seven years on the sprinkled grass. —He is dead: his impious deeds Are on the brass: but who succeeds? Over Babylon's sandy plains Belshazzar the Assyrian reigns. A thousand Lords at his kingly call Have met to feast in a spacious hall, And all the imperial boards are spread, With dainties whereon the monarch fed,— Rich cates and floods of the purple grape: And many a dancer's serpent shape Steals slowly upon their amorous sights, Or glances beneath the flaunting lights: And fountains throw up their silver spray,— And cymbals clash,—and the trumpets bray Till the sounds in the arched roof are hung; And words from the winding horn are flung: And still the carved cups go round, And revel and mirth and wine abound. But Night has o'ertaken the fading Day; And Music has raged her soul away: The light in the Bacchanal's eye is dim; And faint is the Georgian's wild love-hymn. “Bring forth”—(on a sudden spoke the king, And hushed were the lords loud-rioting,)— “Bring forth the vessels of silver and gold, Which Nebuchadnezzar, my sire, of old Ravished from proud Jerusalem; And we and our Queens will drink from them.” And the vessels are brought, of silver and gold, Of stone, and of brass, and of iron old, And of wood, whose sides like a bright gem shine, And their mouths are all filled with the sparkling wine. Hark!—the king has proclaimed with a stately nod, “Let a health be drank out unto Baal, the God.”— They shout and they drink:—but the music moans, And hushed are the reveller's loudest tones: For a hand comes forth, and 'tis seen by all To write strange words on the plastered wall! —The mirth is over;—the soft Greek flute And the voices of women are low—are mute: The Bacchanals' eyes are all staring wide: And where's the Assyrian's pomp of pride?— —That night the monarch was stung to pain. That night Belshazzar, the king, was slain!— —Many a silent age the prow Of untiring Time—(dividing Years and days, and ever gliding Onwards) has passed by:—And now, Where's thy wealth of streets and towers? Where thy gay and dazzling hours? Where thy crowds of slaves,—and things That fed on the rich breath of kings? Where thy laughter-crowned times?— Thou art—what?—a breath, a fame, In the shadow of thy name Dwelling, like a ghost unseen; Grander than if laurels green Or the massy gold were spread, Crown-like, upon thy great head: Mighty in thy own undoing, Drawing a fresh life from ruin And eternal prophecy:— Thou art gone, but cannot die. Like a splendour from the sky Through the silent ether flung, Like a hoar tradition hung Glittering in the ear of Time, Thou art,—like a lamp sublime, Telling from thy wave-worn tower Where the raging floods have power, How ruin lives,—and how Time flies,— And all that on the dial lies. A WAR SONG. Are the white snows which crown thy hills untrodden, Are thy sons valiant still,—thy daughters pure, Ceraunia?—or hath War, which makes the world Blush in its blood, stained all thy hills and valleys? Awake! The Turk is coming:—from his den Where he once slept, lustful, intemperate, He comes mad as the sea, and blind with hate. Awake! Bare all your weapons till their light Dazzles the sky, now sick with coming woe. Awake! The Turk is on your heart. Awake!— Awake! 'tis the terror of war; The Crescent is tossed on the wind; But our flag flies on high like the perilous star Of the battle. Before and behind, Wherever it glitters, it darts Bright death into tyrannous hearts. Who are they that now bid us be slaves? They are foes to the good and the free: Go bid 'em first fetter the might of the waves; The Sea may be conquered,—but we Have spirits untameable still, And the strength to be free,—and the will. The Helots are come: In their eyes Proud hate and fierce massacre burn, They hate us,—but shall they despise? They are come;—shall they ever return? O God of the Greeks! from thy throne Look down, and we'll conquer alone. The world has deserted our need: The eagle is prey to the hound;— It may be; but first we will battle and bleed, And when we have crimsoned the ground, We'll shout at the slaves of the earth, And die,—'tis the chance of our birth. Our fathers,—each man was a god, His will was a law, and the sound Of his voice like a spirit's was worshipped: he trod, And thousands fell worshippers 'round: From the gates of the West to the Sun He bade, and his bidding was done. And We—shall we die in our chains, Who once were as free as the wind? Who is it that threatens,—who is it arraigns? Are they princes of Europe or Ind? Are they kings to the uttermost pole?— They are dogs, with a taint on their soul. Away!—Though our glory has fled, For a time, and Thermopylæ's past; Let us write a new name in the blood of our dead, And again be as free as the blast. The lion, he reigns as of yore: Shall the Greek be a slave?—and no more? Away! for the fight may be ended Before you arrive at your fame. Your fathers the land and their dwellings defended, And left them to you—with a name, Oh! keep it: it sounds like a charm: It will guard you from terror, from harm. For our life,—it is nothing,—a span: 'Tis the body, and Fame is the heart. Is there one who rejects the bright lot of a man? Let him be the last to depart: Let him die on his pillow, a slave,— For us, We have conquered the grave. SONNET. A STILL PLACE. Under what beechen shade, or silent oak, Lies the mute sylvan now,—mysterious Pan? Once (while rich Peneus and Ilissus ran Clear from their fountains)—as the morning broke, 'Tis said, the Satyr with Apollo spoke, And to harmonious strife, with his wild reed, Challenged the God, whose music was indeed Divine, and fit for Heaven.—Each play'd, and woke Beautiful sounds to life, deep melodies: One blew his pastoral pipe with such nice care, That flocks and birds all answer'd him; and one Shook his immortal showers upon the air. —That music hath ascended to the sun; But where the other?—Speak! ye dells and trees! SONNET. TO THE SKY-LARK. O earliest singer! O care-charming bird! Married to morning, by a sweeter hymn Than priest e'er chaunted from his cloister dim, At midnight,—or veil'd virgin's holier word At sun-rise or the paler evening heard; To which of all Heaven's young and lovely Hours, Who wreathe soft light in hyacinthine bowers, Beautiful spirit, is thy suit preferr'd? —Unlike the creatures of this low dull earth, Still dost thou woo, although thy suit be won; And thus thy mistress bright is pleased ever. Oh! lose not thou this mark of finer birth;— So may'st thou yet live on, from sun to sun, Thy joy uncheckd, thy sweet song silent never. FINIS.</field>
