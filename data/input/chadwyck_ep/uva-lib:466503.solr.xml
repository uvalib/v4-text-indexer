      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF RUTLAND, K.G. This Uolume is Inscribed, BY HIS EVER MOST AFFECTIONATE DAUGHTER, THE AUTHOR,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LONDON AT NIGHT. Not to the o'ershadowing Heavens of Majesty, That rush in glory on the uplifted eyeâ That strain the labouring sense, and sternly mock The unequal mind with keen and mastering shockâ That drown the soul in floods of paly light, And depths of gorgeous darknessâmore than bright: Not to the midnight Heavensânot to the array Of worlds by dizzying myriads they display, Now do I turn my long, mine earnest gaze: Imagination dies within their blaze! Fancy shrinks backâbewildered and aghast, Before the outshining wonders there amassedâ But springs to unimaginable life, In this dread City's silenceâsince all strife Seems now forborne; and deep thereon is laid, Oh, what a load of stillness and of shade! Ye stars! that do exulting shine and stream, Till in one mass of glory mixed ye seem, While each its tributary lustre bringsâ Like the regalia of the King of kings! Ye are, indeed, resplendent and august; Lauded and honoured ye should beâand must. Ye are, indeed, like heaven's own envoys sent For homage, terror, and astonishment. But 't is to different speculations now I turn, with throbbing heart and thoughtful brow,â To thee, great City!ânow with clouds o'ercast; Or if I view thee as a temple vast Of the mute dead, and of the breathless past; Or as the home of living myriadsâfraught With all the excess of feeling and of thought, Oh, what a source of contemplations deep For memory long in her rich scrolls to keep,â Oh, what a grand and overpowering theme For lingering thought and shadowy-lengthening dream, Thou art, and must be!âwake my spirit, wake! Earth's selfishness and sordor from thee shakeâ Resign the fardels of life's crushing careâ A prouder freightâa loftier burthen bear! Rise, like a dream of worlds, Past Ages, rise, Wring forth response from midnight's air and skies; Float on the winds, till every altered tone Shall seem the voice of generations gone; Dwell in my heart, and on my thought descendâ Mix with my soulâwith mine existence blend! Shine forth, ye beings of the past, shine forth, In all your ancient might and primal worthâ Come, breathing strength along the silence, come, While massed in undistinguishable gloom Frowns dimly forth each high o'erarching dome, And glimmers faint each lessening, lengthening spire, As through the midnight, shooting high and higher! Look round you! whosoe'er ye be, that tread This wide realm of the living and the dead! Temple and tower majestically old, Though lacking the ivy's thousand-tendrilled fold, Surround you here.âLook on yon sacred pile, Within whose pompous shade of arch and aisle, They whom the world gone-by hath worshipped, sleep, Feel ye not Time's dread wing all the earth o'ersweepâ Kings, Conquerors, Bards, Priests, Legislators, there One common yoke with common sufferance bear. And if, with magic spell and wizard might, These could be summoned from the depths of night, Which would the heart most passionately crave To rescue from that thraldom of the grave? Oh, were it mine to arouse and to invoke, To set free from that dire and tyrannous yokeâ Ye Conquerors, resting from your splendid toils (Whose hands incarnadined, reaped Victory's spoils) Ye wielders of war's thunder, forced to keep The unbroken sabbath of the tomb's long sleep, Not ye would I compel, not ye would call From columned shrine and dim sepulchral hall! Not ye would I adjure to appear, to arise Forth from your proud cathedraled sanctuaries, Pale shadowy majesties!âOh, ye who have been The wonders and the terrors of earth's scene, How changed is now each once monarchic mien! Ye kingly phantomsâback unto your rest! The imperial stole and the emblazoned crest, The jewelled sceptre and the mace of state, The insignia of past power, can but create A fund of sad reflectionsâhence! awayâ Ghastly grows night, o'erta'en with new dismay; Ghastly would grow the golden laughing day, Were ye, with sumptuous mockeries girt, to evade Your dungeon's bounds, and its bright noon to o'ershade. Hence with that dreariest shroud, the ermined robe, The cape and tireâthe signet and the globe, Emblems of empireâOh, how worse than vain, When joined with the ensigns of death's hideous reign! Hence! for ye must not to my soul replyâ Little recked ye of human destiny, Of all its varying tides, and changeful sky; Back to your realmless privacies of gloom, The escutcheoned coffin, and the sculptured tomb. Genius! do thou in robes of light appear, Thou immaterial sun of this dim sphere; Do thou, while cancelled cycles with thee wake, And from oblivion's coil of fetters break, Do thou make answer to my passionate quest, And in thy might of eloquence attest The shrouded marvels and the secrets dread, That seem to slumber with the unconscious dead. Deliver thou, oh oracle divine, Judgments too bright to escape from earthly shrine; For earthly shrine thou claim'st not, but the cope Of the outstretched heavens,âthou shalt fulfil my hope! Thou shalt give forth a thousand strong replies, Thou godlike native of the eternal skies! Thou, thou shalt render full response and deep, And whirlwind-like, the listening soul o'ersweep; Thou shalt set forth, in thy victorious might, As if with tongues of flame and thoughts of light, All that the mind should most to know desire, Breathing along itâin a storm of fireâ Those glorious Truths for whose free draughts I yearnâ Those myriad mysteries that I pant to learn,â TimeâTime himself, with sovereign mastery taming, Through the uncommunicativeness proclaiming, Of old long-unremembered years! betrayed To rigorous silence and unpitying shade, Thou shalt set forth!âhearkening my soul's appeal, Thou shalt uplift from buried years the seal; And thou shalt melt away the heavy frost, That weighs upon earth's banished ones, and lost, In thy triumphant sway, thy conquering power Thus, even in the stern strength of this dread hour, O'er the uncommunicativeness prevailing, Of centuries of obstruction and of failing! Arise thou!ânot an unembodied dreamâ Not in shapes varying as the rainbow's gleamâ Not in phantasmal, strange abstractions shownâ No visionary guest, unnamed, unknown! No! seize a nobler incarnation, wake In loftier guiseâin bright assumption take Features familiar to our thoughts and minds, Though vanished like the clouds before the winds. Genius! rise thou in panoply of might, Sweeping the veil of mysteries from the night; Unchangedâuntransubstantialized, arise, As long since to contemporaneous eyes Thou didst appear, in glorious forms enshrined; Forms to the dustâthe dust of death consigned! Unchangedâuntransubstantialized, awaken Even in those forms, unshadowed and unshaken; Accord them to a moment's worship, yet Their sun of soul is overcast, not set. They could not die! forefend the impious doubt, All worlds of thought withinâall heavens without; They could not dieâour guides, our spirit-friends, With all existence, their existence blends; Survivors of themselves, they have maintained, And shall maintain, their ruleâand as they reigned Of old, shall reign and rule for evermore. Their Metropolitan throne in the deep core Of the human heart established! fixed to endure While love is strong, or sacred wisdom pure; Their Capitolian seat, built on firm ground Of passionate sympathies, that know no bound. Untouchedâuntransubstantialized, discover, By thee informed, those who once shadowed over The astonished nations with their thoughts, too deep, Not like a storm-eclipse awhile, to o'ersweep Earth and her empires, and too utterly bright Not to o'erpower at length the outlustred light With their excess of glory; while Truth's formâ The rainbow of bleak Error's lowering stormâ Was slow revealed (not as on darkness traced, A host of worlds break forth where stretched a waste), But shadowed forth upon the astounding blaze Of their clear, constellated thought's full rays; So shall their dreams developeâspreadâaspire To firmaments of lightning and of fire;â Those thoughts shall breathe through the stupendous soul Of Nature, quickening all the unbounded whole, Till they o'er-canopy the ancient skies, And veil with their most mighty spiritualities Ev'n the great starsâthat shall remit to shine, Ere they shall in secession dim decline. And be they honoured, those Transcendant Ones, Who in old times had risen to earthly thrones, Till, by apotheosis, raised above, Ruling mankind through reverence and through loveâ With mountains bewn for their assigned abodes, An earth-controlling commonwealth of Gods! Rise ye unto my soul, calm, still and vast, Ye crown?d spirits of the vanished past, Each in the lineaments arrayed ye wore In your proud daysâyour golden days of yore; Each one reflected in clear hues of life (Yet with no vestige of its cares or strife), Like some fair image, which no winds make break, O'erthwarting the pale crystal of a lake, Bosomed in breathless woods, far inland placed, By mountainous amphitheatre embraced, And canopied by stillest skies;âeven thus, Ye crowned spirits, pure and luminous, Shall ye be mirrored in my inmost thought, To utter calm, and perfect quiet wrought. Rise ye unto my soul then, Genius! riseâ Re-animate those hallowed formsâtill vies With radiant noon intense the entranced night, Round those freed slumberers trembling into light! Not those alone, whose honoured reliques lie In this proud city's Abbey-sanctuary, But all whose scattered ashes well might claim A separate monument of towering fame, And yet whose embers raise the lowliest mound, The neighbouring airâthe common greensward ground To something far more precious and divine Than columned fane or jewel-fretted shrineâ In wondrous Shakspeare's long-evanished frame, Shakspeare!âillustrious, universal name! In Chaucer, Spencer, and each laurelled sage, That rose the enlightener of his raptured age; In sightless Milton's venerable mould; In Locke and Verulamâsublimely bold; In world-compelling Newton's aspect old, Genius, appear!âand that last name might well Break blank Annihilation's deadliest spell! Newton!âthe etherial harmonies he crowned With full perfection, should that name resoundâ Newton! whose mind august, supreme, immense, The astounding fiat of Omnipotence (That fiat which bade countless systems be, And blazing worlds o'erflowâthe Infinity!)â Ratified in the sight of all mankind! Whose all-transpiercing, all-constraining mind, Ruled by eternal Truth's unfaltering sway, Rent through Creation its victorious way, And midst the abstrusest deeps of mystery cruisedâ Nor erred, nor foundered, nor shrunk back confused. That mind, which in the mastery of its might, Like the pervading element of light, Streamed through a thousand thousand worlds, nor knew To be bewilderedânor to miss the clue, The precious compass of high faith! (which still Beaconed thee on)âthou, whose triumphant skill So rescued the everlasting worlds from wrong. That mindâkeen, fervent, fresh, serene, and strongâ Which tired the incomprehensible at last, And saw upon the unrolled and levelled past The shadow of the approaching future fall, Which measured, fathomed, scanned, and vanquished all! And that which seemed the impracticable, tamed To its high willâthen was at once proclaimed Thy Triumph and the Universeâoh thou! To whom great Nature did herself avowâ Like a dread prophetessâawakened, fired, By thee arousedâelectrifiedâinspired;â Thou breathedst through her vast and hollow shrine, Till each response rose more and more divine; Thy thoughts were epochsâmightiest Potentate!â A crisis in the governance of fate Each grand conception of thy genius grew! In thy mind's universe the old systems knew, (Glorying in undimmed pomp), their pride of placeâ As in the outstretched immensities of space, Their actions, revolutions, laws, forms, schemes, Were mirrored in the depths of thy vast dreams! The majesty of many sovereignties Girt theeâby Heaven ordained to monarchize, And not below,âbut in the eternal skies; Thou Conqueror and crowned King of Thought, who yetâ Midst the vain din of earth, the toil, the fret, Didst reverentially, devoutly move (As thy great soul were capable of love, Humility, and child-like faith alone) From world to world, as 't were from throne to throne, In boundless power and utter lowliness, In patient hope and zeal's unblamed excess, Shaking on its unveiled foundations, even As though to assay its strength, the empyreal heaven! Creation's circumnavigatorâborne By sails o' the lightning! with the breath of morn Filled gloriously! and in a self-launched bark, Lonely and convoyless as the olden Ark, Still strenuously absolving thy dread round, With calm persistance nought could e'er confound; Though lingering with circuitous delay, To track each planet's orbit on thy way, Unwearied, didst thou the arduous whole achieve, Nor sought auxiliar aid, nor asked reprieve; Those labyrinthine lengthenings of thy course Following, fulfilling, with unlessened forceâ Beginning, ending with creation's Source!â But surely thou stood'st awfully apart From the mixed beatings of the popular heart; Thy constellated forehead was upreared, High midst the august sublimities insphered In yon starred firmament; thy stately march Was through the heavens, thy grand triumphal arch!â Haply, beneath the very stones I tread, Amidst the nameless, undistinguished dead, Those mouldering lie, that better far could teach The o'erwhelming mysteriesâscience ne'er shall reach; Haply, those rest, that better could impart The knowledge deepâthe science of the heart, That knew its complicated workings best, And all the arcana of the human breast! The passionate secrets of its joy and woe, Which they must learn to feel who seek to known, And yet, which those who most intensely feel, Are ever last to expound and to reveal; And could they rise from their sepulchral cell, This hour would suit such apparition well. No echoes now the fanes of worship fillâ The hollow-sounding pavements now are still, That rang with multitudinous steps erewhile; Hushed as the vaults below, sleep nave and aisleâ While Death, embosomed in the depths of night, There slumbers calm, as cherubs lapped in light, Nor heeds the horrific work that must proceed Where he abidesânor shall he ever heed! Ye deep, and dread, and sunless catacombs, Imagination pierces your black glooms, Ye cities of the dead!âthe impassive dead!â By shuddering fancy tremulously led, I wander midst your chill, forsaken halls, Where not a weed invests the crumbling walls, And muse midst your great commonwealth of graves, Far underneath life's ever rolling waves. There, in that silent empire of the dust, Lie all comprisedâall things we love and trust; All that we scorn, and all we most revere; All we abhor, desire, seek, shun, or fear. There Valour liesâcrushed down, subdued and tame; And Sorrow, melted to a lovely name, Knowledge, with its dread sovereignties and vast, Its appanage of future and of past, Reconciled in the ruin of the grave, And slumbering side by side in that drear cave! Fame, with its burning crown, and haughty power, That stalks o'er earthâthe idol of an hour, Beauty, with th' exquisite glory of its bloom, Alas! how dimmed, how altered in the tomb! Imagination through the Unmeasured streaming, With all her boundless worlds of shadowy dreaming; And Loveâdeep love!âthat seems to breathe and burn From the chill precincts of its funeral urn, With starry immortality endowed, Even in the icy foldings of its shroud. Love! no, thou art not to the dust consigned, Most mighty spirit! thou'st but in bliss rejoined Thy kindred elements, and brightly risen From the dull boundaries of thy clayey prison. Honour to thee, thou strong and gracious Night! Honour to thee, in thy prevailing might, Thou sanctifierâthou beautifierâall Consents to thy most glorifying thrall! 'Tis thine with reverential love to enfold, And, oh! to adorn the ruined fanes of old; 'Tis thine, in thy calm watchfulness to spread A mantle of deep beauty o'er the deadâ The mighty or the lowlyâall who trod, A thousand years ago, earth's vernal sod, And all who yesterday were summoned hence; (Oh, let us hope, fenced round with innocence!) The sovereign masters of the sovereign mindâ Those who left past and present far behind, And met the future on its shadowy flight, Piercing its dimness with prophetic sight;â And they who humbly lived, and meekly died, Unwarped by selfishnessâunchilled by pride, Passing through each probationary stage, Upborne by faithâfrom youth to wintry age: They, whom love watched with keen and jealous care, Tempering for them life's too inclement air, Beguiling mortal hours of their dull weight, And strengthening them to meet each turn of fate With still submission, calm and high;âand they, Who trod a bleak and uncompanioned way, Who vainly lovedâand felt they lived in vainâ Fond martyrs of a deeply-bosomed pain. Lo, fancy cites them from their chill retreats, Robed in the sackcloth of their winding-sheets! Dim, pale, and beautiful, from their charnel-grounds Theyrise, with their faint smiles and staunchless wounds. Their staunchless wounds! have they not passed away? Are they not from that pressure of dismay, Which crushed them to the dust, now utterly freed? Their staunchless wounds!âoh, they have ceased to bleed; And soothed are now, and lulled into repose, What were on earth immedicable woes. And those enthusiast spiritsâfinely fraught, As if with fire from heavenâintensely wrought And exquisitely strung, till every sense Was in itself a fervid soul intense, And life a passion and a dream became, Restless as is some fierce wind-shaken flame? Even theyâthose restless ones!âare now at rest, With Peace, unalterable peace, their guest. The stars in bright battalia have come forth, Wakening the heart to dreams of purer worth Than in Day's hurrying season had possessed That heart, then feverish with a vain unrest; But now, 't is charmed from such disquietude, And o'er bright visions undisturbed doth brood, While beautiful as a fresh, unfolding rose, The tablet of its new emotions growsâ Leaf after leaf enkindling,âshades by shades, The picture of its new enchantments spreadsâ And into harmony divine constrained, Too sweet to be resisted or sustained Depths within depths, of full and fairy dreams, (A confluence rich of many mingling streams!) O'erflow its stillness, while a quick delight Seems even to seize the impassive soul of Night. And in the adoring hush of this deep hour, What feeling rules with most prevailing power! Angel of life! Affection! thou, even thou Dost win us to thy silvery yoke to bow, And like the silent-brooding mother-dove, O'ershadowest us with wings of haunting love. Affectionâwith thy strange, sweet mysteries, That mount like exhalations toward the skies, Their place of refuge sure, yet not afar,â Not to the uttermost realms of sun and starâ Not to the unrecked-of wonders, deep enshrined In lone recesses of the human mindâ Not to the unbornânot to the enshrouded deadâ Not to the midnight shadows round me spread; Nor to the past, nor to the future years, Need I these questioning eyesâbedimmed with tears, Turn, to behold thy hopes and battling fears, Thy exultations, tremors, agonies, Thy lovelinessâin every shape and guise. Affection, no! bright spirit! thou'rt now and here Around me and within meâever near; Thine ardent dreams and hopesâthy griefsâthy joys Are ceaseless, all-pervading! time destroys All else! but thee he may not crush nor quench, Nor from thy roots of strong endurance wrench; Elastic, from his footsteps thou upspringestâ His trampling footstepsâand triumphant wingest Thy flight through the universal heart of man, As since creation's wondrous scheme began Thou still hast done; and thy pure reign is now, And yet for evermoreâunconquered thou, That universal heart thy boundless home! In life thy worldâin death thy temple-tomb; Thy rich, thine ever unimpoverished mine, Thy sheltering ark, and cloistered, curtained shrine: Genius, may pale upon his towering throne, His kingliest vassals lost, his votaries flown; Mind's awful sceptre untransmitted fall, Its dynasty of crown?d spirits, all Chambered in dust supineâwith none reprieved, To achieve (as they of old in might achieved), Miracles of transcendance; none to assert Its empiry august, with triumphs girt; Passion, betrothed to Change from birth, may droop, Misled by many a meteor of false Hope; Grandeur succumb, midst its chief trophiesâPower, May veer and vacillate from hour to hour; Fame, turn to ashesâKnowledge, lapse and waneâ And Wisdom sink, the vainest of the vain! Time shall remit not his chill hand to impose On allâtill his own reign at length shall close:â But thou, Affection! without pause or change In this wild world, the fearful and the strange, Shalt hold thy wayâthy high and heavenwards way, Asserting thine uncompromising sway. No moment shall be meted out on earth, That shall not hail thy ever-lovely birth; No season shall arriveâno dawning hour, That shall not bless thy deeds of gentle power; From heart to heart thou still shalt leap and bound; The soul's most secret gulfs shall freely sound, And sow them with thy priceless pearls most pure, Which shall, unstained, immaculate endure The harvest-growth of the great spirit deep, Which heaven shall ripen, angel hands shall reap. And now, even now, while Silence quells the air And sky with stillness, 't is a weight to bearâ Silence, that even midst shadowy streets is broken But by a dreamy humâa murmuring token Of the most mighty lifeâwhose deep heart beats For aye, in those o'er-populated streets; And now, ev'n now, thy loftiest sway is knownâ Thy might, thy strength, unutterably shown; Thy will obeyedâthine influence confessed, Where all seems gathered unto breathless rest. A thousand thousand hearts at this still hour Keep trembling vigilsâvassals of thy power: Haply o'er some loved slumberer's brief repose, Stretched on the couch of suffering and of woes, One doth in speechless anguish fondly bend; While o'er the image of some parted friend, Another, sad and solitary leans, And weeps for by-gone hours and vanished scenes. But 't were in vain to attempt thy steps to trace Through every change of circumstance and placeâ Too boundless is thy reign, too vast thy scope, Thy ways too complex; thou still rulest in hope, In joy,âin fear, in anguish, or despair: Ev'n on the Grave's chill thresholdâmightiest there! Yet mighty alwaysâmightiest every where! Affection! where is thy most favoured spot? Ah, where on earth the site thou hauntest not? The mother's heart should seem thy throne of thrones, Built upon nature's strong foundation-stones; But firm is thy inexorable claim, And pure thine ever-heavenwards-pointing flame Within all virtuous bosoms; thine it is To unlock for them the richest founts of bliss, And ah! the heaviest springs of sorrow tooâ Yet not for them alone; since thou can'st woo The harshest natures to thy sweet constraint, Though dark with many a brand, and many a taint; Thou girdlest all with thy enduring ties, Round all thou weav'st thy circling charities; Through all the boundless family of mankind Do thy electric currents deeply wind Their imperceptible and noiseless way, Though undiscoverably hid from dayâ Through all the unlimited family of man Thy quickening influences flowâas ran Around the shores of man's young Paradise The four bright riversâcoloured with the skies, The four bright rivers, clasping it about, All Heaven withinâall Deity without! Though much be lostâabolishedâdarkly reft, Thouâthou to soothe each mortal ill art left; Though much be changed, be crushed, still thou art spared, Living, and breathing Life, fresh, unimpaired, And guarding still thy altars, undecayed, Thy household Gods unbroken, and displayed Where'er a meditative eye can turn Unostentatiously, by hearth or urnâ Beneath the o'er-shadowing roof-tree's leafy gloom, That whispering waves o'er some sweet cabin-home, Or loftier shelter of fair trellised shades, Aspiring domes, and sculptured colonnadesâ Oh, come! with holiest inspiration fraught, And breathe thy soul through my enkindling thoughtâ Affection, come!âwith all thy mystic train; Heart-melting Pleasureâspirit-grinding Pain,â HopeâFearâthat oft fantastically strike As twins, even undistinguishably like. Sorrow! the beautiful and wondrous dream, That makes all things her very shadow seem, That moulds all nature to her fatal will, With melancholy art and painful skill, And walks the earth, and walks the starry skies, Led by the dying light of her own eyesâ The light of staunchless tearsâthough worlds conspire To bathe her track in floods of living fire, Though all Creation's loveliest works should meet In vain luxuriance spread beneath her feet, Beyond all else of beautiful appears To herâthat shadowâdarkening through those tears! Affection, with thy long retinueâcome, And make my heart thy altar and thy home! And yet 't is vainâhopeless it is, and vain, To seek the wandering thoughts to fix, to enchain To aught, midst this august, stupendous mass Of marvels,âthey from theme to theme will pass, Swift as cloud-shadows o'er some streamlet's glass. And thou! rejoicing, splendid riverâthou, Whose breast a thousand keels triumphant plough, Thou dost now win them for awhile to dwell On thee, exulting in thy foamless swell! Majestic stream! how nobly in their pride The tall, swift vessels o'er thy surface glideâ Do they not bring thee tributary spoils From fruitful continents, from spice-fraught isles, From gorgeous strands with Heavens of purple crownedâ From palmy coasts, luxuriant and renowned; Bright coasts, whose dust is treasureâand whose caves Are roofed with glistering gems,âwhose very waves Flow over sparkling beds of precious ore, Paving with pomp of pearl and gold the shore, Rich as some Genii-king's fair fabled store; Well mays't thou go rejoicingâthou sublime And most majestic stream! image of Time, On-sweeping in disdainful revelry To thy great bourne, the everlasting seaâ As he to death, with all his hurrying waves, Which flow above a treacherous shoal of graves. And yet not so,â't is falseâI do thee wrong, Not in disdainful revelry along Dost thou go triumphing; but calm and stillâ Thou dost thy missioned ministry fulfil, In stateliest graciousnessâand gentlest power, Smooth as fair rills, that haunt some sylvan bower; While more than empire reigns along thy shores, And more than affluence down thy current pours, And more than grandeur meets thee on thy way With Kingly state thy towery banks to array: How beautiful thou art now! bedecked and lit By starry gleamsâwhile o'er thy surface flit Myriads of crispy-wreathed smiles that break Where'er the night-breeze fitfully doth wake; That sparkling start to life, and sparkling die, How brilliantly, how lustrous-dazzlingly! Father of waters, roll, and bear with thee The likeness of most glorious Liberty! Not such as lives along the unruly ocean In savage revelry of fiere commotion, Heightening the stormy triumph of those waves, Too often hollowed into treacherous gravesâ Too often deepening to destruction's chasms, Convulsed with thunder-fits and whirlwind-spasms; But in the fulness of a perfect peace, Too perfect for accession or decrease; Most fitly imaged! such as lives and glows In the eternal heaven's sublime repose; In the sweet freedom of the liberal air, When nought but light and sunny balm is there; And in the stillness of a deep, pure flood, Fulfilling in unbroken quietude Its chartered, measured, and appointed course, With calm persistance and apportioned forceâ Father of waters, roll! and bear with thee The likeness of most lovely Liberty! Father of waters, roll! thine aspect sheds A glory o'er the scene that round thee spreads, The heavensâmagnificently dread, or bright, Or in the pomp of noon or lull of night, Make thee their mirror; and 't is well to see Those imaged Heavens in stainless purity Shining amidst the city's dim repose, Or clamorous conflicts that ne'er seem to close, As though to exorcise all its sins and woes; Smiling midst its mad chaos of fierce toil, Where life's great deep would seem to overboil, And earth's predominance to rise o'er all That should win man to a sublimer thrall, Where jarring interests crowd, and throng, and press, Constraining all with adamantine stress! 'T is well to see heaven's glorious aspect there, Ev'n in the heart of turmoil and of care, Mingling upon the water's beauteous breast With glimpse of palaced streets, in massive rest Composed; of structures of a thousand years, And those of yesterday, their last compeers; Of fretted spires, that as they lessening rise, Glance like retorted lightnings to the skies, To which they point with never-ceasing aim, As though man's wandering fancy to reclaim To their fair land of promise, blue and bright, Stretching away to realms of living light,â 'T is well to see Heaven's awful reflex there, Softened and mellowed through the silvery air! While shine its glimmering raysâits bright cloud-isles, Like gleams and glimpsings of its angels' smiles! A borrowed lustre all the scenery wears, And vested in enchanted guise appears; An overflow of beauty from the skies Seems pouring down on our bewildered eyesâ Those skies that glorify the gladdened earth, Morn, eve, and night, with quick successive birth; Of changeful splendours, prodigal of joy, Lavish of brilliant wealth, without alloyâ Their superfluity of loveliness Lendingâo'erburthened with its rich excessâ To earth, in luxury of munificence! Yet as I gaze, one painful throb intense Through my recoiling sense doth quivering dart, Chilling the trembling pulses of my heart. Alas! beneath thy bright and breezeless wave That doth so gloryingly the proud banks lave, How many victims of despair are laid! Not in the folding funeral-shroud arrayedâ Not in the monumental mound composedâ Not where the hallowed gates of death are closed 'Gainst the light stranger-footsteps! Yet they sleep Well in their watery bedâthe calm and deep! And oh! whate'er the gloom spread darkling there, The intruder's desecrating step can ne'er Break in upon their last, their long repose, The silence of their cares and maddening woes!â But hence! vain, melancholy thoughts, away! I will not bend me to your saddening swayâ Let nobler feelings warm the awakening breast, To loftier themes be every thought addressed. How can I gaze on thine exulting tide Without an ecstasy of kindling pride, River of England! how can I survey The thronging wonders that attend thy wayâ Though mantled now in night's prevailing shade, To fancy's eye still faithfully displayed! Thy forests of tall masts that bristling rise, Like serried lances pointed 'gainst the skies; The rich and royal argosies that sweep, Proudly o'er thee, as o'er the unfathomed deep, Without a transport of resistless joy, Too deep, too exquisiteâtoo pure to cloy. We look on thee, our country's stream of streams! Till half her glories rush upon our dreams, And in thyself most beautiful thou art, Thou bright, triumphal roadâblue liquid mart; No scantling stream before our eyes doth glide, Meandering slow, where thou roll'st by, in pride, Thou sweepest alongâa stream of strength and state, Past London's towersâthe greatest of the great: Might not the sea-volcanoes, vast and dread, The sea-volcanoes of our navies, spread Their blazoned glories to the sunshine here, And their broad-streamer'd masts triumphant rear! Winged citadels of the armaments of war, Which bear the Imperial Island's mandates far, And brunt the stormsâthough rocked on treacherous floods, Like the wedged phalanx of their native woods, The quellers of the billowy revelry, The dreadless wrestlers with the eternal sea! The trident-sceptre by their mistress swayed, By them defended, is by all obeyed. Lo! how they sweep, midst rampant seas along, Glorying, triumphant, jubilant and strongâ Like giant steeds of battle in their pride: And who are they that govern and that guide? Who but the island-bornâthe Kings at Sea, The armipotent, the fearless and the freeâ England's unconquered Ocean-chivalry! Oh! from such visions of the haughty main, Calm Thames,â't is sweet to turn to thee again! Thy rival-rivers through an hundred lands, Though they may roll to rich and dazzling strands, And on their waves all imaged splendours bear, Shall yield to theeâthou great beyond compare! Not for th' amazing wealth that is thy dower, That loads the ships that o'er thy surface tower With freights of sumless value, though they hold A monarch's revenues in gems and gold; Not for the might of arms, the pomp of arts, That to thy name so proud a charm imparts; But that fair Freedom sits enthroned beside The mazy windings of thy rushing tideâ Thy banks are altars, and thy currents flow, Murmuring victorious pÃ¦ans as they go, Till every wave of thine might seem to be A bright libation, poured to Liberty! How royally thy Crown of scattered Domes Thou wearest amidst old Midnight's purple glooms, Those purple glooms that round thee float and cling, Like the dyed robes of some great earthly kingâ How royally thou flashest back each gleam That quivers o'er thy calm, broad, placid streamâ How royally the Royal city's pride Of tower and turret, glassest in thy tide, So softly shadowed forth, and pictured there, They look like immortalityâso fair!â And shall thy waves,âthy proudly-freighted waves Ere flow or stagnate, mid a waste of graves, Whilst far from thy forsaken banks shall rise Empiresâdominionsâprincipalities, New to the astonished earth, constrained to obey The recent sceptre of their rising sway? Shall thy broad zone, forlornly glittering, bind Ruins and fragments hoar? thy waters wind Midst shadowy desolations, wreck-strewn plainsâ Oblivion's blank and loneliest domains? London! most glorious London! thou that art Earth's diademâthe universe's heart; London! thou city of citiesâfeared, renowned, A mighty nation midst the awed nations roundâ Thou great emporium of the attracted world, Thy banners of old victories now are furled; But thy proud flags of perilous enterprise Still flush the wave and flout the kindling skies; Through undiscovered seas and trackless lands, Thy missioned envoys bear thy high commands. What future destinies for thee remainâ What limits are affixed to thy wide reign? The inarticulate prophesyings low Of the quick heart speak little, â can that know? No glance can fathom, and no thought divine What mixed futurities shall yet be thine! But this is sure; that thou one day must fall, Girt with bleak Desolation's heavy thrallâ One only city shall such doom defy, The Eternal City of the eternal sky! The New Jerusalem, throned high and far, Beyond the blazing realms of globe and star, Builded of jasper and of chrysoliteâ The Heaven of Heavens its element and site! Around whose walls the immortal river runs, Lit by a thousand and ten thousand suns! That city only shall unmoved remain, Eternity shall try its strength in vain! For theeâthou shalt decline, shalt surely fail, Thou must behold thy westering star grow pale; Thou, O Imperial City! may'st not last For ever!âhark! a voice warns from the past! Ere this, hath Ruin marked thee for her prey, Withering the bulwarks of thy strength away; Ere this Destruction her fierce scourge upreared, And midst thy monuments of pride careeredâ Her minister, that element of wrath That leaves but smouldering deserts in its path. Lo! how it laid thine old foundations bare, Missioned to strike, and impotent to spare! Thy mighty arsenals, that might in awe Have held a world, so could not bid withdraw, That fierce Invader, who made all his prizeâ Thy treasuries heaped with princely merchandize, Thy piles of stateliest masonryâthy fanes, Made holier still by Time's recording stainsâ Till the upheaving and o'erwhelming flood Coloured the shuddering skies and stars with blood, While tower and templeâshaft and dome and spire, But brought fresh fuel for that funeral pyre, That Heaven-assaulting Pyramid of Fire! Ere thisâhath dread Annihilation cowered Where thy old hallowed fanes, far heavenwards towered, As though they would be voiceless Intercessors For the denounced ones, the comdemned transgressors, The anguish-stricken multitudes beneath, Who wrestled vainly with the torturing death. Black plague and pestilence within thy walls Abode; and stalked throughout thy darkened Halls, Thou crowned-one of earth's Kingliest Capitals, In formless horrorâscattering o'er their path Dire drops from th' unsealed vessels of Heaven's wrath (Till like one vasty charnel-house became That mighty cityâmighty but in name! One open Golgotha, it seemed to spread, Ghastly and horrent with the plague-struck dead!) Have not these things had power to scare, to warn? Should they but reap forgetfulness or scorn? Still darest thou place in pillared strength thy trust, Thy pillared strength that crumbled into dust?â Where reigns the world's proud mistress, awful Rome? Go, ask of splintered shaft, and fractured domeâ A world herselfâcrushed down into a tomb! How doth towered Tadmor hold her ancient reign? How her majestic sovereignty retain? The desert of the deserts! she concedes Her pomp to scorpion-broods and battening weeds; Her strength to every fitful gust that raves, Midst her dismantled wilderness of graves, While still she sinks, supine, from day to day, In gorgeous dreariment of slow decay! There is an Eye, a dread unsleeping Eye, That scans at once thy veiled futurityâ Thy present and thy past; to whose deep glance, Though every ebb and flow of circumstance Through all revolving seasons (like a fold Stretched in the shepherd's sight) thou spread'st unrolledâ An eye which watches thee through varying fate, Through each and all, and every change of stateâ Whether the shadowy web of mourning falls In pomp of gloom o'er thy stupendous walls, And the deep booming of the funeral bell Startles the neighbouring air with ominous knell; Or the bright blaze of lamps by myriads meets The Stars, midway from thy Imperial streets, One glad illumination Earth and Sky Composing,âwhile thy shouts are, Victory!â The thunder of thine acclamations sent, Like earth-born tempests to the firmament! Still that dread Eye regards thee, still surveys Through noon's strong glare or midnight's curtaining haze; Then be thou holy, midst thy pomp and pride, If thou in steadfast greatness would'st abide, If thou would'st scatheless brunt time's strenuous shock, And fix thy firm foundations on a rock! An age of ages haply then may crown Thy front but with accession of renown! Oh! be thou holyâmidst thy strength and might, So may refulgent day and solemn night With alternation of rich blessings move Round theeâanointing thee with dews of Love! Be holy thou! Inviolate and pure, So may'st thou reign! so flourish, and endure!â Holy as thou might'st seem at this still time, Wrapped in a calm unearthly and sublime, Sleeping in thine own mighty shadow, cast Around theeâlike a dim veil of the Past; Dusky and denseâa curtain huge and deep, Drawn o'er the solemn stillness of thy sleep, Like the great World itselfâthe unbounded World, Whose shadow streams immeasurably unfurled, In billowy folds of darkness towards the stars, Like some dread banner of Hierarchic wars, Vasty and massiveâglorified and emblazed By flashing meteors on its surface raised; Yet not of war the ensign, but of peace It floatsâdeep shadow! when vain conflicts cease, And slumbrous Night's all-reconciling reign Brings a brief armistice for grief and pain, Oh! be thou holy! may thy hearths and homes Be sanctified with loveâthy regal domes, Worthy of kingly conclaves, hallowed be To loftiest schemes of glorious polity, To high magnanimous counsels, firm and pure, The popular weal to exalt and to secure! Religion, at thy towering Altars stand To inspire, to upraise, to invoke, and to commandâ Peace, with her multitudinous blessings, dwell Within thy proud walls inaccessible! (For Victory, though awhile supine, awaits An untasked handmaid at thy trophied gates), Shrined in thy heart of hearts, for ever be Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Reverence, Liberty; These from thy murmuring depths shall mingling rise, A pyramid-palladium to the Skies! A Consecration and a strong Defenceâ Appeal from Earth to Heaven's Omnipotence! Oh, be thou holy! if thou would'st be great, Or in the palmy pomp of sceptred state, Or in the ordeal of an adverse fate: Be holyâso shalt thou be still revered, Even when no more obeyedâno longer feared: Be holy! so shalt thou stand forth sublime, Lowered, or in height of pride, to all succeeding Time! THE RECONCILIATION. Am I forgiven? Yet say those words again, Banishing every trace of every fear, Bringing back Hope with all its laughing train, Hopeâthat each brief estrangement makes more dear. Ever-o'erpoweringly within my heart, Thy blessed forbearance shall remembered dwell, Causing full many a tear of love to start; Full many a sigh of o'erwrought bliss to swell! Repeat those cherished accents, that restored Hope and existence to my suffering spirit; Happier, to owe my happiness,âAdored! To thy sweet mercy, than to mine own merit! Yet, dear one of my heart! sole treasure thereâ Thou kind and true, beyond all power to express, Proud should I now become, might I but dare Measure my merit by my happiness! Make not offending almost sweet to me, By such rich reconcilement, full and deep; Draw not repentance near to ecstasy, By all the Love I waken when I weep. THE SHADOWS ARE NOW THY DWELLING. The shadows are now thy dwelling, Thine element is the nightâ Thou all of earth excelling, Most beautiful,âO most bright! Thy beauty is of the past! Thy gladdening smile hath flown, Thy voice is in silence' waste, Lost, lost is every tone! The crown of thy glory is crushed; But thy chain, oh, thy chain it is riven! Thy soul hath through darkness rushed, But hath it not rushed to heaven? Oh! is't with rejoicing or regret, That we now should think of thee? Rejoicing, if we can earth forget; But if Heavenâoh, misery! LINES TO ? And hast thou wept for me? O joy and grief; I know not which is deepestâwhich is chiefâ 'T is happiness! and yet I scarce can bear That thus in my keen sorrows thou should'st shareâ 'T is sadness! yet 't would wring my very heart Were that most sweet dejection to depart! And hast thou wept for me? O grief and joy; Joyâwith what costly, exquisite alloy! Griefâwith what honeyed sweetening in her cup, Tempting the heart to drink its rich draughts up! It is a sorrowful, yet strong delight, Mastering the spirit with its gentle might; It is a tender and serene regret, Such as my heart could wish not to forget. And hast thou wept for me? O joy and griefâ I know not which is strongest, which is chief! Those passionate, and O! most precious tears, The interpreters of Love's warm hopes and fears: How do they seem along my heart to melt (That heart which such chill loneliness hath felt) How freshly through my softened soul they flow, And reconcile to much of pain and woe. Mine had flowed feelingly and fast as well, For they were stirred within their secret cell! But thineâthose passionate and precious tearsâ Pure as the light that streams from heaven's fair spheres, Too soon, Beloved and Loving that thou art, Rose into Hope's own rainbows round my heart! STANZAS. This Loveâthis deep, this mighty Love, That makes my heart in music move, To thee a dream, a trance may seem, To me it makes all else a dream! And those who love notâDreamers all, Round whom Indifference weaves her pall, Her chilling pall, her darkening shroud, That wraps all nature in a cloud! And oh! that smile, which doth exert No magic o'er thy moveless heartâ It may seem nothing unto thee, 'T is more than all I wish to me! This Love; this deep, this mighty Love, Which makes my heart such transports proveâ To thee an empty dream may seem, To me it makes all else a dream! THE HOUR OF PRAYER. To see the beingâexquisitely dear, Slumbering in all unconsciousness of fear, Or care, or hope,âbeneath our watchful eyes, Thrills the deep heart with trembling sympathies; The soul we have so lived in, known and loved, Seems from our kindred soul too far removed. We may not follow on its viewless trackâ Bright-pinioned Thought, were all too dull and slack: Imagination all too cold and weak Its hidden haunts to pierce, or even to seek! Its unseen path we may not hope to trace Through the wide dream-lands of aÃ«rial space, Whose gorgeous mysteries shrink from our foiled gaze, When not ourselvesâin sleep's enchanted mazeâ Whose varying splendours mock our vain essay To scan them by the light of common day! Sleep's world is boundless; like Eternity! Past, present, future, there appear to be, Commingling and compressedâno bournâno bound, Doth there the aching sense, surprise, surround; But all, is indistinct, and vague, and vast, And all, alas! too beautiful to last. Yes, mighty influences! strong and deep, Dwell round our loved one's in the hour of sleep: But there is yet a deeper, stronger hour, Of more prevailing and o'erwhelming power, Of more victoriousâmore transcending might! Whether at rosy dawn of opening light Or shut of flowers, or hush of stillest night, Or slumberous lull of noontide's sultry air,â Think, think ye of the hallowed Hour of Prayer! Oh! to behold with thoughtful-drooping eyes, In blest communion with the eternal skies, The Chosen-one, and cherished of the heart, Doth it not to the softened soul impart A solemn peace, and to the uplifted mind A cloudless joyâexalted and refined? Doth it not raise on Faith's sustaining surge, The thoughts so won, from Care's dim depths to emergeâ Doth it not sweetly, strangely, richly bless With calm and beautiful heavenly-mindedness? Oh! let us keep our spirits pure, to share Our own Beloved-one's consecrated prayer; That holy hush, that gracious stillness seems To emparadise us in a world of dreams, A veil of woof Ã¦therial,âintervenes 'T ween us and life's intoxicating scenes. From its cold, hollow pageantries we turn For lovelier things, for loftier joys to yearn, While crowd to breathlessness in the heart's core (Like thronging waves along the heaving shore) Thoughts wrestling with themselves, till they grow strong To bear the upspringing soul with them alongâ Yet with a calm, a not ungentle force, They urge and guide it in its skyey course: Not like the hurrying and tempestuous strife Of wild emotions, quick with fiery lifeâ The Passion-whirlwinds droop and sink away Beneath that deep hour's harmonizing sway! Something more holy than Earth's joy or woe 'T is then the bosom's privilege to know! A solemn ecstasy of full repose Calmly throughout the entranced existence flows. A fulness of sublime tranquillity Smoothes the soul's waves into one breathless sea: The precious breathings of that whispered Prayer Float by, like sweet streams of celestial air, Like perfumed flames they brightly seem to efface The soul's dark plague-spots with their glowing trace. Oh! that those plague-spots might not there be found Deadlier than Grief's immedicable wound, Since that but wrings the heart with piercing pain, And theyâthe marks of sinâcorroding stain;â Would we might keep our spirits pure, to share Our own Beloved-one's thoughtful-breathing Prayer! A thrilling sanctity pervades the spot, How oft 'mid crowded fanes acknowledged notâ Where mighty harmonies in thunders roll, Yet fail to move the unaccordant soul; Where pompous shrines and splendid oriels blaze, And only win the homage of the gaze! While in the chamber's calm and still retreat, Where kindred hearts in kindred worship meet, We little need the elaborate aid of artâ The Beautiful is breathing at the heart!â Oh! let us keep our spirits pure, to share Our own Beloved-one's heavenward-mounting Prayer! THE WIZARD: A Fragment. The voice, like dying thunders rolled alongâ An awful harmonyâas sweet as strong. âBend but to me in vassalage thy knee, And gifts unearthly shall be dealt to thee: Thou shalt possess a Talisman of power, To check the tempest in its triumph's hour, To blunt the lightnings on their dazzling path, To lull the ocean's stormy joy and wrath, To hurl back the loud Lauwine in its fall, To bind the elements in viewless thrall!â Bend but in vassalage a lowly knee, And awful gifts will I concede to thee: Knowledge of dread, deep, and unfailing spells, A clue to mystery's most secluded cells, Proud mastery and dominion uncontrolled Wherever wind hath rushed or wave hath rolled! Thou shalt in freedom and in might career From world to worldâfrom glorious sphere to sphere. Their mysteries and their marvels to extort Shall be thy splendid toil, thy kingly sport; Thou shalt unravel all their hidden schemes, And laugh to scorn Philosophy's vain dreams. Thine shall be more than even monarchic swayâ Full-blown Success shall pave thy glorying way; Thou shalt cleave through the huge, the solid globe, Its inmost depthsâand central mines shalt probe; Its caverned treasuries shall unlock, explore, And rifle them of their refulgent store! Thou shalt, ascending and descending, pierce To far recesses of the universe; All things shall own thy bidding and behest, All things unveil to thy triumphant quest! Thou shalt observe, and recognize, and share All powers of earth, fire, water, sublest airâ Thou shalt detect, perceive, and apprehend The harmony of things, their aim and end, And with the soul of their existence blend! And 'midst the labyrinths of all mysteries move, Not to perceive alone, but to assay and prove. Thou shalt become, all dreadless and elate, A strong coadjutor of conscious fate. Familiar shalt thou be with all th' unknown; The abstruse, the occult, shall unto thee be shown, Till thou, in thy brief span of life shalt be Experienced in th' unveiled Eternity, Through the stupendous gifts 't is mine to accord, Wilt thou but hail me as thy chief and lord. Through the high counsels, the efficient aid Of mightiest spirits, in dread strength arrayed; Through the deep converse, awful and intense, With loftiest orders of Intelligence, Which thou shalt hold, in midnight's haunted hours When earth is visited by Viewless Powers,â The intercommunicativeness sublime Of thy raised thoughts with pierced and vanquished Timeâ Through the prevailing power, and mastering might Of vigil, spell, ordeal, and mystic riteâ Through the intertransubstantialization Of all the elements of dread creation With thine own essenceâquickened and refined, Darting through all, as darts the enfranchised mind In chainless dreamsâbut they may lead astrayâ Thou shalt not fear to miss thy certain way!â Thou shalt in lightnings scour th' empyreal plains, The lightnings shall run quivering through thy veins; Thou shalt in sunbeams revel far and free, Those sunbeams even shall grow a part of theeâ Familiar thus, even thus shalt thou become With all the works of Nature, Chance and Doom; And bared before thy free and filmless eyes Thall be the unknown, the immense Infinities, Through the surpassing gifts 't is mine to impart To those who serve me with a loyal heart. These gifts, this sovereign knowledge shall be thine Wilt thou but now, before my throne inclineâ This power, this high power, shall be dealt to thee, So thou wilt serve me with true fealty.â Then a voice rendered answer, calm and clear, 'T was something surely, more to feel than hear; More to the heart addressed than to the ear: âThose accentsâspiritually musical, Bound the 'rapt senses in their silvery thrallâ And woke the gladdened soulâdivinely woke To deeper lifeâand thus that calm voice spoke: âThere are more mighty giftsâknowledge there is, More pure, more glorious, and more vast than this; There is a loftier powerâwould I might show These things to theeâoh! would I might bestow On thee their uttermost pricelessness of worth, Beyond all else to be desired on earth! Rich gifts of Love, and Purity, and Truth, Of Wisdom, Hope, Long Suffering, Meekness, Truth; Knowledge of Mysteries boundless and intense, Awful with spiritual magnificence. Knowledge of Truths, stupendous and august, Mighty to upraise the soul from earth's dim dustâ Power, through the external shell of things to see, Through all to trace creative Deity!â One universe of Deity to explore, To hail, to extol, to avow, and to adoreâ And with strong Faith's transpiercing eyes to mark Things in themselves obscure and densely dark; And still to feel, though veiled to outward sense, The omnipresence of Omnipotence.â THE CARELESS LADYE. âLadye, Ladye, why sitt'st thou in silence and lone In thy bower by the rose and the jasmine o'ergrown, While the hunter's horn rings from the hills of the deer, Oh! why dost thou sit in thy loneliness here? âLadye, Ladye, how lik'st thou this weary life; This strange tissue of pleasure and pain and strifeâ Ladye, bright Ladye! I pray thee to say, Or art thou mournfulâor art thou gay? âOr haply art thou nor gloomy nor glad, Nor merry of mood, nor sullen nor sad; Or haply is't neither yea nor nay, Ladye, sweet Ladye! I urge thee to say? âOh! I once had a dark-eyed daughter dear, And her heart was broken without a tear; She drank a deep cup of bitterness, And died in her spring-time of loveliness. âIn silence she suffered, in silence she sighedâ In silence she sickened, in silence she died: Doth grief untold on thy heart's core prey, Bright Ladye, sweet Ladye! I urge thee to say?â Quoth sheââI am neither merry nor sad, Nor over-gloomy nor over-glad; Nor joyous, nor sorrowfulâsullen nor gay, Nor mournful nor mirthful, by night or by day. âMy heart is contented, my mind is at restâ And blow the wind east, or blow the wind west; Come April-showers, or Midsummer's-ray,â Quoth she,ââI have never more to say! âHad thy dark-eyed daughter been more like me, She had broken her heart for no vain phantasie; With peace and with prayers, she had gone to her graveâ Farewell, old Sir Knight, and Our Ladye thee save! â'T is seldom I smile, but 't is seldom I weepâ Fare thee well, ancient knight, and Our Ladye thee keep! I pray thee to pardon my mind's wayward mood, And I pray thee to leave me toâSolitude.â âYet a moment, I prayâyet a little while stay! I am oldâI am greyâthou should'st not say me nay; Fain, fain would I question thee, Ladye, awhileâ Now thanks for that gracious and softening smile! âTell me, lov'st thou not banquet and state festival, The fair-tapestried chamber, and banner-hung hall? The pomp and the pageantryâsplendour and lightâ The queenly array, and mixed throngs, proud and bright? âAnd dost thou not love the gay chase, when the morn Gives her glad echoes out to the hunter's shrill horn, And the wild-boughs crash loud to the stag's antlered head, As he springs from his covert, all panting with dreadâ âOr dost thou love better the champaign's wide scene, When the falconers are there, in their vestments of green; And thine own tassel-gentle is placed on that wrist, Whose blue veins e'en an Emperor were proud to have kissed! âOr say, is thy choice for the masque's gorgeous show, Where the splendid procession moves stately and slow; For the mummeries' devices, all mystic and strange, Their fictitious display, and fantastical change; âOr doth thy bright eye grow more gloriously bright, Where spear strikes with spear, and knight challenges knight; Where the plumed crest that glittered the loftiest there, Is bowed to the dust in thy presence most fair? âWhere a knot that hath fastened thy hair's precious coils, Should be deemed worthiest meed for the combatants' toils; Where a smile from thine eye, that ne'er knew how to frown, Should outweigh chain and charger and Victor's fair crown?â âSir Knight! 't is a grand, glorious sight to behold, Their long glittering lances, their pennons of goldâ Their scutcheons and collars, their scarfs broidered fairâ And their surcoats of ermine, and blazonries rareâ âAnd Sir Knight! 'tis more glorious, far grander 'tis still To behold them put forth all their strength and their skill, When the trumpet brays loud, and their steeds rush in might, In the foam of their pride, to the shock of the fight: âA crowned King hath borne Conqueror's crown in my name, And challenged the world for my beauty's poor fameâ And full many a Chatillon, many a Lord, Hath worshipped and wooed me with spear and with sword! âHeard ye not of the tournament, fair and renowned, Lately held on this spotâon your hoof-trodden ground? Heard ye not how the famed chiefs thronged in from afar, All arrayed in the fierce-gleaming harness of war? âThere on high, and apart, was my canopied seat, While challenged and challenger bowed at my feet; There more than one Prince set this proud lance in rest, And more than one Prince watched my beck and behest.â âThen must thou be the famed Ladye Ermengarde,â Cried the ancient Knightââtheme of minstrel and bard; Whose beauty 's enshrined in Provencal love-lay, Whose smile is a bright spell, of limitless sway! âWhose name through the courts of the wide world hath rung, Through the courts of a world hath been sounded and sungâ Theme of many a roundelay, tale, and romance, Through all countries, but chief thro' thine own sunny France. âGramercyâbright Maid! that at last I have seen The world's chosen mistress, and Beauty's crown'd queenâ Gramercy!âand glad is the old Knight to hear That thy heart is not hung 'twixt a smile and a tear: âThough the one be a warm, rosy meteor of light, Still the other doth haunt it, with chill and with blightâ May thy brow ne'er be darkened, thy cheek ne'er grow paleâ Gramercy, bright Maid! for the sight and the tale.â âSir Knight,â straight the courteous young maiden replied, âI have told not my tale through vain-glory or pride; But with deference meet, to thine age from my youth, I have told thee (perchance but too freely) the truth.â âMay each saint in the calendar bless thee now, Oh! queen of the rose-cheek and bright sunny browâ May each saint in the calendar guard thee and keep, May'st thou ne'er be unqueen'd, by Time's traceries stamp'd deep! âI was mighty once, who am now a bruised reed; Farewell crested helmet, and fierce warrior steedâ Farewell to the battle, the tournay and tilt, No more must my hand grasp the sword's bossy hilt. âBut behold ye!âthe Ladye of Ladyes most bright Turns not frowning away from the gray ancient Knight; Though no more in the lists, and no more in the field, Conquering arms in fair Beauty's behalf can he wield! âAlas! I am a Knight of an ancient age, No more must I send the blithe little foot-page, With token and trophy to Ladye's hush'd bowerâ With token and trophy, with jewel or flower.â âNow may heaven thee save, thou good knight and true, Thou hadst thus at my hands but thy right and thy due; And the crimson of shame should flush deep on my cheek, Could I spurn thee discourteouslyâfear not to speak. âThe crown of hoar hairs is a dread, solemn crown, Before which youthful heads should in homage bow downâ What more may it be thy good pleasure to ask? To give faithful response, shall be Ermengarde's task.â âOh! then tell me, thou gracious and gentle one, tell, Why dost thou apart in this loneliness dwell; Dost thou mourn not the chaseânor the falconry's sport, Nor the pomp and the state of the fair royal courtâ âDost thou sigh not for bright scenes of pleasaunce and pride? Oh! thou that should'st be a young monarch's crowned bride, Dost thou wish not to be midst the proud and the gay In thy life's rosy seasonâits fresh flowery May? âDost thou grieve not, away from the glad festal board, Where the minstrel's voice chimes with the harp's ringing chordâ Where each Knight in the blood-red wine mantling up high, Doth pledge his heart's Sovereign, with smile and with sigh? âHath the saraband's mazes no charms in thy sightâ Can the mummeries quaint, yield thy soul no delight? Nor the murmur of flatteries, the whispers of love, Bid thy bosom one tremor of ecstasy prove? âOh! but surely thou lovest the masque and the mime, The trump's sounding challenge, the Troubadour's rhyme?â âSir Knight,â with a smile, then responded the maid, âI grieve not for the sun when I rest in the shade; âIn the festival's glare, in the banquet's glad hour, I mourn not for the calm of my dim latticed bower; In the shelter and gloom of that bower's still repose, I regret not the festival's splendours and showsâ âI hear not now the young Troubadour's tale; But sweet, oh most sweet! is the nightingale's wailâ No armoured gallant now boasts my behest, But my follower is Peace, and Contentment my guest! âNo silver-belled merlin now takes its stand On the broidered glove that encloseth my hand; But a thousand wild-birds hurry by to their nests, With their bright wings of glory and rich starry crestsâ âI have left columned chamber, and bartizann'd tower, For the hush and the dusk of my rose-trellised, bower; I might like them in sooth, well enough were I there, As it isâoh! I find the green woodlands more fair. âThere are times when I mix with the festal crowd, And deem not its music of joyaunce too loud; There are times when the copse and the grey twilight-hill Seem not to my fancy too lonelyâtoo still.â âOh Ladye!â the Knight of an ancient age said, All courteously bending his silver-hair'd head; âOh Ladye! I ween by the peace thou dost prove, That thou never hast bowed to the wild rule of Love?â âThou art wrong, thou art wrongâoh! how sorely thou art wrong! But no parlaunce of thatâthe words freeze on my tongue: As the cold, careless Ladye, still let me be known, Though alas! I have loved (who has not?) one alone! âBut 't is doneâit is pastâ't is forgotten and o'er; He thinks not of me, and I love him no moreâ 'T will be long ere another shall reign in a heart Where a false tongued traitor had portion and part. âNow farewell, Sir Knight,âfrom the chase of the deer, Soon my sire shall return to the banquet's cheer; But midst hunter and wassailer, chieftain and bard, He will grieve if he misses his own Ermengarde!â</field>
