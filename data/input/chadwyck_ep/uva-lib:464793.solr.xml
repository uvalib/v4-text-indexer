The Argument. Troy had now withstood ten years Seige, and with incomparable valour resisted the Greeks, when at last her Champion Hector being taken, through the Treachery of a Stratagem, she was sack'd, fir'd, and brought to ruine and destruction. The Greeks intending now to depart to their long left homes, were by a contrary wind stayed, when the Ghost of Achilles appearing, commands them not to stir thence, till they had immolated the Princess Polyxena (under the pretext of a marriage) to his Ghost. Chalcas their Prophet being consulted, he gives judgement, that not only the Princely Virgin must dye, but that also Astyanax the Son of Hector, must be flung from the Top of a high Tower in Troy. Which Tragedies being accordingly acted, the Greeks hoist Sails and depart loaden with Captives, Riches, and Glory. Dramatis Personæ. Hecuba. Queen of Troy. Agamemnon. General of the Greeks. Pyrrhus. The Son of Achilles. Andromache. Hectors Wife. Helena. The Wife of Menelaus, stolen and married by Paris, the cause of Troys destruction. Ulysses. A Subtle Grecian. Astyanax. The Son of Hector. Calcas. A Grecian Southsayer. Talthybius. A Grecian. Polyxena. Mute. Senex. Nuncius. And Chorus. Of Trojan Women. The SCENE Troy. The first Act. Enter Hecuba alone. Who trusts in Kingdomes, and who puissant bears Rule over mighty Monarchies; nor fears These Comments are not for the learned's sight, The dark unlearn'd these Tapers onely light. It may be meant the Inconstant Goddesse Fortune, who was the Servant of the Gods, to whom was attributed the disposal of all sublunary things, she was painted with the horn of plenty in one hand, and a wheel in the other, by which was meant, her disposal of all earthly riches and the inconstancy of them: Volat mobiles alis Nec ulli prestat velox fortuna fidem. Fortune flies with swift wings, nor doth With any, fickle she, keep faith. Sen. in Hippol. She was painted, also blindfolded, as bestowing her favours either impartially, or promiscuously as Senec. in Hippol. Res humanas ordine nullo Fortuna regit, spargitq; manu Munera Cæcâ. Humane affaires w'thout order Fortune guides: And with a blind hand all her gifts divides. Or else, ? Faciles dare summa deos, eademq; tueri Difficiles. ? The Gods are prone great things to send, But backward the same to defend.Th'inconstant Gods: Who on Prosperitie Relies too much; Let him consider me, And thee ô Troy. For Fortune never bore Of great mens slip'ry state such Proofs before. The Head of Pollent Asia. The great work O'th' Neptune and Apollo, who induing humane shapes, were hired by Laomedon, to build the Walls of Troy, which being finished, he deny'd them their promis'd reward: The Gods angry at his perfidiousness and perjury afflicted the City, Neptune with inundations, Apollo with a pestilence. Laomedon Consulting the Oracle, it was answer'd, that the Gods could not be appeased, without they chose a Trojan Virgin by lot yearly, and exposed her to be devoured by a monstrous Whale: After many had run this fatal Chance, it fell at last on Hesione, Laomedons daughter, Hercules coming thither by chance, and seeing the Virgin bound to a rock, bargains with Laomedon to set her at liberty, and slay the Monster for his Horses begotten of divine seed: Hercules perform'd his part, but Laomedon denying him his reward, he returns afterwards with an army and sacked Troy, taking Priamus then a Child prisoner, but having slain Laomedon, he sets Priamus at liberty to enjoy his fathers Realm. Thus Ovid. Met. 11. ? Apollo, Cumq; Tridentigero tumidi genetore profundi Mortalem induitur formam, Phrygiæq; Tyranno Ædificat muros, pacto pro mœnibus auro, &amp;c. By Sands Translated thus. ? Apollo, Who with the father of the tumid main Indues a mortal shape: and entertain Themselves for unregarded Gold to build The Phrygian Tyrants walls. That work fulfill'd The King their promised reward denies, &amp;c.Gods above doth in its ruines Lurk: To whose Rhesus King of Thrace, whose horses had they drunk of the River Xanthe by Troy, (as the Oracle delivered) Troy had been invincible, but he was slain, and his horses taken before they came thither by Ulysses and Dromedes.assistance came both those that drink At seven mouth'd put for Ister which falls (like Nile) into the Sea at 7 mouths.

Sands Translat. —When greedy flame, devour'd the funeral pile, The flying, dying Sparkles joyntly grow Into one body.

The power of the Gods adverse to me, My Country's ashes, Phrygian King, O thee Whom Troy hides, with the whole Kingdome; and Thy Manes Hector, by whom Troy did stand Whilst that thou stood'st: And ye great flocks of my Own Children, and the lesser Umbræ, I Call all to witnesse, whatsomever ill Hath hap'ned to us; I beleived still What ever ills Priamus's daughter, whom Phœbus loving, Sued for her maidenhead, which she promised him on Condition that he would indue her with the gift of Prophesie, or foretelling things to come; which having granted her, She would not hold to her promise, which the deceived God seeing ad?ded to? his former gift, that whatsoever she foretold, though never so true, should not be Credited: Nor did the Trojans believe what she predicted till afterwards they found it true to their sorrow. Tunc etiam fatis aperit Cassandra futuris Ora, dei jussu, non unquam Credita Teucris. Virg. Æn. 2. Cassandra then, these future fates foretold, Whom Trojans ne're believ'd, so Phœbus would. Ogleby interpret. Cassandra prophised In her mad fits; though God prohibited. Hecuba when she was with Child of Paris, dreamed that she was delivered of a fire-brand, which proved true, in that he was the cause of Troys destruction.With-child I this first saw, a Prophetesse I unbeleiv'd before Cassandra was. Crafty Ulisses, nor King of Ætolia, the Constant Companion of Ulysses in all his exploites: In stealing the horses of Rhesus and the Palladium of Troy, which could not be Conquer'd whilst that remained there.

Sinon, these Fires hath sown: No, no, this fire is mine, 'Tis by my Hecuba when she was with Child of Paris, dreamed that she was delivered of a fire-brand, which proved true, in that he was the Cause of Troys destruction.Firebrand that ye now do shine, Ah sad old woman! why thus long do'st thou mourn The Cities downfal? O unhappy! Turn Thine eyes to fresher griefs: Troy's downfalls old, That execrable fact I did behold The Priamus slain by Pyrrhus at the Altar of Jupiter Hercius, which was in the Court, between the Entrance and the Hall, where the Kings use to be Crowned.murther of the King: yet greater harm, 'Twas at Jove's Altar; and by Pyrrhus arm I saw when that fierce man, with fatal hand In Priamus's curled locks entwin'd Forceing his head down, hid his horrid sword In a mortal wound; who willingly was gor'd: Which done, he from the old man's throat again Drew forth the blood-wet blade. Whom he amain Pressing th'extremest point of age; at all Could not appease but by his cruel fall. The Gods are witnesse of this mischeif; and The Altar sometimes of this ruin'd land. Priam parent of so many Kings e'rewhile Wants now a Sepulchre; a fun'ral Pile In flaming Troy. But this sufficeth not The Gods. See I a Master now by lot Must choose with th'Daughters of King Priamus, And his Sons Wives. Whom shall I follow thus Poor prey?

Tell what is Ulysses plot, what wickedness doth he Contrive; what, must the Maid cast headlong be From the Idæan rocks? must she be sent From the high Tower's highest Battlement? Or from those rocks must she into the vast Sea, which Segeon's cleft side bounds be cast? Tell tell what's hid in thy deceitful breast. Alass! this evill's worse than all the rest. That Hecuba's and Priam's Son in Law Pyrrhus should be. What plagues preparest, say? Shew, and let's not in our Misfortunes be Beguil'd; To die we ready are you see. Helena. Would Calchas also would Command me to With Sword the Stays of hated life undoe. Or that I might by Pyrrhus's cursed hand Be slain before Achilles tomb, and stand O Polyxen! a part'ner in thy woo. Achilles doth Command that thou be to Him given; that thou thy life 'fore's ashes yield, That he thy Spouse may be ith' Elysian field. An. See with what joy her death pronounc'd she hears, With Princely ornaments her self she tires, Her hair she suffers to be Curl'd, It seems, She Mariage Death, and Death a Mariage deems. But see! my Mother swoons at this sad news, She faints! Arise! take Courage Mother! use Courage! take heart—. How small a thread doth stay Her parting Soul! A small thing Hecuba Can happy make!—She breaths:—She lives: thus still “Desired death fly from the wretched will. Hecuba. Doth yet Achilles Live to punish us? Rebels he yet? O Paris Who had not wholly slain Achilles. For Achilles being drawn into Troy under the prext of marrying Polyxena was, slain by Paris. hand that thus So lightly struck! His Tomb and ashes they Thirst for our blood. About my side a gay. Some say she had 15, some say 22, others 50.Troop once did stand. I wearied was to deal My Kisses and my Love amongst them all. This onely's left, Hecuba's onely Child, Companion, joy, she who my griefs beguild. She had also Cassandra living, but she was not her companion, being the Priestess of Apollo, and so as it were none of hers. And therefore she was to be free from the lot, as not to have been accounted as among the spoyle, but she was alotted to Agamemnon.I onely her call Child. Unhappy still! Fly hence Soul ease me of this onely ill. See Tears bedew her Cheeks, a sudden shower From her dejected Countenance doth power. Be glad O Child Cassandra would rejoyce, Or Andromach, to be espoused thus. Andr. 'Tis we! 'tis we! O Hecuba 'tis we Should be lamented, scatter'd on the Sea And up and down dispers'd: But Helen then Shall her dear Earth and Country see agen. Hel. You'd grudge my State more did you know your own. Andromach. Is any part of my Torment unknown? Helena. The Fickle lot hath giv'n you masters shall. Andramach. Whose Servant ?I?? who must I master Call? Helena. The Pyrrhus. Scyrian youth by Lot doth Challenge thee. Andromach. Happy Cassandra! She had also Cassandra living, but she was not her companion, being the Priestess of Apollo, and so as it were none of hers. And therefore she was to be free from the lot, as not to have been accounted as among the spoyle, but she was alotted to Agamemnon. Phœbus sets thee free. Helena. The General has her. Hecuba. Is Hecuba by any claim'd? Helena. Thou art Ulisses's prey. Hecuba. What Cruel and unjust Lot-sorting Guide Was this, Princes to Princes that deny'd? What God the Captives lots thus badly drew? What Cruel Judge, who for poor wretches knew Not how to chuse them Lords? And whose dire hand Has gi'n us such unequal Fates? who send Doth Hector's mother to That was to Vlysses, who had the Armour of Achilles in possession, being to him alotted by the Greeks, from Ajax Telamonius, which so enraged him that he slew himself. Ovid. Met. 13. Achilles Arms? I'm to Ulysses sent. And now all harms, Captivity, and Death, doth me behem: Not of my Bondage but my Lord I am Asham'd. He Hector's spoyle doth bear, who does Achilles Arms bear? Land that Seas inclose And barren shall that hold my grave? Away Ulysses lead me; for I make no stay. My Lord I follow: me my Fates. The Sea May it no Calm retain! But let it be With Winds disturb'd. The Fates of Priamus And of myself, wars, Fire follow us! So shall my pain prove gain to me, so that Such prize Ulysses by his Lot may get. But Pyrrhus with a hasty pace doth run, And Cruel Look, why stay'st thou Pyrrhus? Come Pierce my breast too, and let Priamus and She.us now Conjoyne: Old Priam's Murtherer, fit this blood of mine Is by thee to be shed. Polyxena Take hence and with her Cruel death beray The Gods above, and eke below. why should I you beseech? To such rites Seas I would Have answerable. On your mighty fleet, And Ship that Carries me all Curses light. Chorus. Companions Sweeten Grief; 'tis found Less hard when Cries whole Swarmes resound. Sorrow and Tears more gently bite When Troops with like tears are in sight. Great grief desires still to see, Many fellows in Miserie: And not alone the pain to bear. None nills when all suffer a share. No man wretched himself doth hold If all are so: Men rich in Gold Remove: Remove all such that use To Cut rich land with a hunder'd ploughs; And then the poors Cast minds will rise. None's poor but when he rich espies. In great mishaps 'tis Sweet to see In Sadness every face agree. He doth his fate moan and deplore, Who naked gains the sought-for shore, By swiming from Shipwrack alone. He danger less and's Chance doth moan, Who a Thousand ships did see Together swallow'd by the Sea: Whilst Shipwrack'd planks spread on the Shore When that the Corus in the Latin: a wind usual in the Sicilian Seas, which drives the waters on the Italian Coasts.North-west wind doth rore, Holding back the Constrained waves. Phryxus and Helle were the Children of Athamas King of Thebes and Nepheles: their Mother being dead, and Athamas having espoused Ino, she playing the usual pranks of a Step-mother, they were forc'd to fly, and taking a golden fleeced Ram which was given them by their Father, they adventured to swim over the narrow Freet between Europe and Asia upon his back; but Helle falling off, was drown'd, and so Christn'd those Waters with her name, which has ever since been called Hellespont. But Phryxus gaining safe to the shore, fled to the Father of Medea, to whom he gave this golden fleeced Ram, which occasioned the adventure of Jason and the Argonautes to fetch this Fleece, which they called Phryxeus from Phryxus. Phrixus for Helle's drowning raves, When that the Golden-fleeced Ram On's guilded back bore she and him, And she fell thence into the Sea. This Ogygian deluge hapned a Thousand and five hundred yeers before the building of Rome, and overflowed a great part of Greece, Of which the Poets speak so large, that some have thought it that of Noah, when the whole world was submerg'd. Deucalion and Pyrrha they When they nothing beheld but waves Where all but they had made their graves, Griev'd less together. Alass! all we Anon shall seperated be; And tossed Ships disjoyn our tears, When that the Sayles the Mariners At Trumpet sound shall hoist; and when With winds, and hasty oars they from The flying Shores hast to the Deep. What State of mind shall wretches keep When Seas increase, and Earth grows small? When Ida is a high Hill by Troy, the South part of which maketh a Promontory, and runneth into the Sea. In this place it was that Paris gave sentence for Venus. Of which before. Ida high, lye hidden shall, Then Children to their Mothers, they To th'Children where Troy stood shall shew, And poynting with their fingers Cry, That's Troy where the Smoak on high, Creeps to Heav'n. The Trojans so By black Smoak shall their Country know. Act the V. Scene the I. Nuncius, Andromach, Hecuba. O dire! Cruel! horrid! miserable fate! So sad and Cruel wickedness begat This ten years wars had not. Andromacha's Grief shall I first Condole, or Hecuba's? Whose ills some e're thou moan'st, thou mine dost Moan. All others ills I bear; they but their own. For me all's spoyl'd: all wretches mine remain. Nun. The Child's flung from the Tow'r: the Maid is slain, But both bore death with an Heroick minde. Andr. That double ill shew, how to death assign'd: Go to, tell all for my indurate heart, Desires to hear, o'th' mischief every part. Nun. So Ovid Met. 13. Mittitur Astyanax, illis de turribus, unde Pugnantem pro se, proavitaque regna tuentem Sæpe videre patrem, monstratum à matre solebat. Astyanax thrown is from that Tow'r from whence He had seen his Father, by his Mother shown, Fight for his Kingdoms safety and his own.One Tow'r of famous Troy's yet left, and where Priamus us'd to Sit wars Arbiter, And by signs guide the Armies. In that place His Nephew in his bosom Cherish'd was, Where whilst his Sire with fire and sword persu'th The flying Greeks; h' his acts shew'd to the youth. This noted Tower, once the walls chief pride, But now a Cruel Rock, on every side Begirt was, with the Captaines, and with the Spread troops of Plebeans: Ships relinquish'd be The vulgar thither run. The hill some bord Which doth a Prospect to the place afford: Some gain the high rock, from whose top a band To see this doleful sight on tiptoes Stand. Some bayes, some beaches, others pines get up: The whole wood Shaketh with the hanging troop. The broken mountain's highest part one gets, Another th'halfe burnt houses tops: This sets Upon a hanging Stone o'th' falling wall; Another he on Hector's tomb doth Crawle To see, O wicked! Through the Crouded place Ulysses walketh with a Stately pace, And Priam's little Nephew in his hand; Who with no slow pace to the Tow'r did wend: From whose high top with an undaunted heart, His earnest eyes he threw on every part. As the Stout Lion's tender whelp, who yet Not able for to tear his prey doth threat, His Courage swells, he tries to bite in vain: So the fierce youth a hostile hand restrain Did: whilst he moved into tears below The Captaines, vulgar, and Ulysses too, He onely tearless stood, whom all be waild. But whilst their Prophets words Ulysses told, And to those rites the Cruel Gods did call, He of himself leap'd down amongst them all. An. Colchis was the Countrey of Medea, which, ever since she most inhumanely tore in peices her Brother Absertes, has been branded with the stigma of Cruell and Barbarous, yet Andromach complains (the people thereof) to be exceeded by the Greeks in Cruelty.What Colchian e're; or barbarous A people in the North abhorring Humanity, they neither Till nor Sow the ground, nor build Houses, Cities nor Towns, but all their riches lyeth in their Cattle, which they drive from place to place, carrying with them their Wives, Children, and all that they have in Wagons; for which they have the Epithetes of Barbarous and Wandering bestow'd upon them: They were the original of the Tartars or Tattars, which about the yeer of our Lord 1200 overran all Persia, and began the Empire which they now hold in the East-part of the world. Scythe commit Did such an act? what The Hyrcanians, which border upon the Caspian Sea, adjoyning to Scythia, who live as the Scythians do, barbarously, without laws or government. Caspian borderer that A lawless people are thus much dar'd doe? A most cruel and inhumane Tyrant, who used to immolate all his Guests to Jove, but laying wait for Hercules he was taken by him and slain. Busiris on's Altar no Children Slew: Nor did the A cruell King of Thrace, who fed his horses with mans flesh, but Hercules taking him gave him to be devoured by his own man-eating horses.Horses of Diomedes Banquet upon such tender limbs as these. Who shall unto thy limbs give burial? Nuncius. What limbs remains there after such a fall? The fall has dash'd, and Split his bones, his face, His father's noble Marks, his bodies grace, Confounded are by's fall. His neck is broke, His head is rent, and by flints Cruel stroke His braines dash'd out are; thus his members doe Deform'd lye. Andromach. Thus he's like his father too. Nun. When that Astyanax from the Tow'r was threwn, Waild by the Greeks who this vile fact had done, The same unto Achilles Tomb do hie For to perform another Tragedy. The Rhætean Seas with gentle waves do beat, The farther side; the field doth Compass it On th'other; and the valley riseth there With a small rise; Like to a Theater, The midst inclosing. Swarmes do fill the shores; Some hope her death will free their sluggish oars. Some joy to see their foes Stock slain, To see Most hate the Crime in which they actors be. The Trojans too with fear do thither go Where they behold Troy's utter overthrow. Now mariage wise the Torches march before And Helena. Tyndaris the bride-maid marcheth there, In th'head. The Trojans wish The Daughter of Menelaus and Helena afterward ravish'd by Pyrrhus from Orestes, which was the occasion of his death. Hermiona Such marriage: and th'Adultresse Helena So giv'n t'her Spouse. Both sides amazed are; The Maid cast down her bashful looks doth bare. But yet her Eyes did shine, and fairer shew Her beauty did that it was wont to do. So sweeter shews Phœbus's setting light, When rising Stars bring on the neighbour night. The people Marvail; all do greatly praise, Th'about to die; her Beauty Moveth these, These her soft age; Things flying changes those, But with what Courage she doth death oppose Moves all. Before, Pyrrhus she went: All do Tremble, and Marvail, and her pity too. When they unto the sad hill's top were Come, And Pyrrhus mounted on his Father's tombe, The bold virago not a step withdrew, But met the fierce Stroke with a valiant hew. Such Courage mov'd the Mindes of all, a new Wonder Pyrrhus was slow to run her through. But when his sword h' had hidden in her skin, At a large wound blood flow'd, where death crept in. Nor dying did she Courage lose, she prone And with an angery force fell, as if on Achilles she the See note 21. upon the second Scene of the second Act.Earth would heavy make. Both Greeks and Trojans wept, these prively With fear, the others wept more openly. Such order had these rites, the ground no drop But the blood-thirsty Tomb, her blood drunk up. Hecuba. Go Greeks, you go home now in safety may, And your Safe Ships with spread Sayles plow the Sea. The Maid and Child are slain: wars done; where may I bear my Tears? where burst death's long delay? For Daughter, Nephew, Husband shall I moan? For Country? or for all? or me alone? Death's my Sole vote. Infants and virgins be Slain by thee, where some e're, thou ragest me Alone thou fear'st, &amp; shun'st; from me thy flight Thou tak'st, though 'mong swords, darts, fires, When the taking of Troy was, which was performed in the night, with a bloody rage, horrid tumult, confusion and slaughter. Leaving that City as Ovid describes it 15. Met. ? sic magna fuit, censuq; virisq; Perque decem potuit tantum dare sanguinis annos: Nunc humiles veteres tantummodo Troja ruinas Et pro divitiis Tumulos ostendit avorum. Troy rich and powerful, which so proudly stood, That could for ten years spend such streams of blood; For buildings only, her old ruines shows; For riches Tombs, which slaughter'd Sires inclose. Thus Time and Fate, of the greatest and most flourishing Cities and Empires, as well as of the weakest and most perishable Creatures and things, has been THE CATASTROPHE.fought all Night. Foes, dangers, fire, hath not my Members spill'd, Though I so neer to Priam stood when Kill'd. Nuncius. Hast Captives now to Sea: The sayls are spread, The Ships already are unharboured.
