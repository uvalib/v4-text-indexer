Saint Dauid þan full baldly spake, Als þai fro hell gan fare: ‘A new sang tyll our lord yhe make, Als I myself said are; He þat has bene wirkand Meruayles omang vs here, He has safe his ryght hand To him and his powere; 128 ffull mekely has he schewed his myght Omang all cristen men, He has teched ilka werldly wight His ryghtwisnes to ken.’ þus all þa saintes þanked him ryght þat slyke lane wald þam len: ‘Blyssed be he þat comes als he hyght In þe name of god, Amen.’ Ilk prophete þus gan tell Of þair awen prophecy How he suld hery hell, How he suld for þam dy. 129 Þus als þai vnto welthes went þat war won out of wa, A sang þai said with ane assent þat was þis, ‘Alleluya.’ By þe hand our lord has Adam hent, with Michael he bad him ga; þai toke þe way with gud entent vntyll Paradyse full thra.
