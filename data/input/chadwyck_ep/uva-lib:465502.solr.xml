      <field name="fulltext">VERSES PRESENTED TO CLORINDA, ON Her BIRTH-DAY. Hail sacred morning, whose auspicious light Unveil'd Clorinda to the ravish'd sight! Sure at her birth the Gods conspir'd above To form a rival to the Queen of love; Then the fair charmer from the crystal skies Was sent to make this lower world her prize. When first I felt the rapture of the nine, My verse was offer'd incense at your shrine; Before the fickle world that homage paid, Or you a Goddess by their worship made; And now maturer reason must approve The pleasing object of my former love. Bless'd in enjoyment may you ever live Of all that you can wish, or Heaven can give! May each revolving season glide along Replete with riches of the poet's song! May no fierce passions in your bosom move, And every gay desire refine to love: But when your sandy glass of time is run, And you must fall, like those you have undone; May conscious virtue shine with equal pow'r To brave the tyrant in your latest hour: And after death (for fairest nymphs must die) Waft the bright spirit to your kindred sky. Wandring Thoughts on the State of Man. Begin, my muse, and in a nobler strain Try to unravel the decrees of fate; And search into the real cause of things! Unfetter'd from the chains of rhime now soar (Vain boast) beyond the regions of the sky, As far as tow'ring fancy's flight can reach. How dark and intricate are all the ways Of fate! yet proud ambitious man presumes Assisted by his reason to explore Things infinite, beyond the ken of thought. Something there is within this strange machine, Which elevates my mind, and makes me dive Too deep in fate. How came I to exist? Whence am I? Tell me, ye immortal pow'rs; Why from the peaceful bosom of the earth Rais'd into being in a world of ills, To run the chance of an immortal state In dark perdition, or the realms of bliss? Except the great benevolence of God Foresaw, that this exertion of his pow'r Would terminate in good to all mankind. How is that noble spirit of the soul Infus'd into the body? whence proceeds This satal curiosity in man? And could this beauteous fabric of the world From nothing be produced? or whence derives That bright Existence, that eternal Pow'r, Sole governor of all, his glorious being? Stupendous truths! here human wisdom fails, Lost in a labyrinth of endless thought. Sure we existed in some other state Before this world was form'd, and for our sins Constrain'd to bear so great an ill as life.â How vain the pleasing thought, that happiness Should e'er be found by man! within whose breast So many passions rage, such fierce desires Which by enjoyment aggravate our woes. Here bold ambition with a tyrant's pride Lays waste whole kingdoms; and with lawless might Usurps dominion over vanquish'd slaves; And stains his sword with guiltless nations blood. There fell revenge, that poison to our rest, Exerts her baleful pow'r; and for a deed, Or rash unthinking word, to death pursues O'er distant realms the object of her hate. Here fate in ambush lies in beauty's smiles: Our eager eyes indulge in wanton gaze, Warm wishes, tender hopes, and soft desires; Till lust extinguishes bright reason's flame, Unnerves the soul, and prompts us to enjoy, In spite of consequence, the charming fair Against the laws of honour, virtue, fame; And, for a moment's bliss, entails an age of woe. That bubble happiness deludes our hopes, E'en when we seem to grasp the blessing sure, And think our joys beyond the reach of fate: Like a gay dream, where haughty beauty courts Her lover long enamour'd of her charms, But, when strong fancy winds the passion up To thrilling raptures exquisite to sense, He finds the fair one cheat his promis'd hopes, And clasps a cloud within his fond embrace. Man therefore of necessity is wretched: And who that's wretched would desire to live?â Avaunt such gloomy thoughts! â Shall blooming youth, In melancholy mood, like drooping age In contemplation pine of future ills? No; â let the gay remembrance of delight Inspire a grateful thought for pleasure past! Recall the fleeting hours, when Lydia fair With her enchanting converse rais'd the soul To more than mortal bliss! when jovial friends With wit and humour made the longest night Seem shorter than a transitory dream. Nor mourn my present lot, in Aukland grove, Remote from all the gallant scenes of youth; Which bless'd my better days: in calm retreat Curs'd with no mean dependance, still above The smiles or frowns of fortune: gay content Can form a purer happiness within, Than the vain pomp and pageantry of life. A Copy of Verses sent to Clorinda, with Lucan's Pharsalia translated by Mr. Row. Observe, how Lucan in aspiring flights Of ancient Rome, o'ercome by Romans, writes: How CÃ¦sar fond of popular applause Courts the mean vulgar to support his cause; Encompass'd round with conquer'd nations stood, And stain'd his guilty sword with Roman blood. What noble principles inspir'd their souls, Whose fame successively thro' ages rolls! True Patriots, and steady to the cause Of Rome, who perish'd to preserve her laws! But Cato's sentiments were truly great, Who scorn'd to breathe in a corrupted state; Who proffer'd life with just contempt deny'd, And presevering in his virtue dy'd. What conflicts, Brutus, in thy bosom rose, To follow CÃ¦sar's fortune, or oppose? Who tender nature's strongest ties withstood, And gave up friendship to the public good. But sure the Gods immutable decree For a brave just revenge had destin'd thee, To stop the rapid victor in his course, And save the vanquish'd world from CÃ¦sar's force. What passions in great Pompey's bosom move, When fate resolv'd his utmost strength to prove? To drag the hero from Cornelia's arms, And urge him on to follow war's alarms: With what a tender sense of love inspir'd The warrior from the weeping fair retir'd! In moving strains she mourn'd her wretched state, As conscious of her lord's impending fate. Degenerate Ptolemy! Egyptian guile Shall brand with infamy the sons of Nile; To late posterity their crimes be known, Who made the guilt of civil war their own. Then let us by these great examples taught Improve our minds, and elevate each thought! Pursue the shining path those heroes trod, Nor bend like slaves before an earthly God! That liberty long banish'd other climes By sycophants, who flatter tyrants crimes, Secure may flourish from unbounded pow'r, And fix her empire on the British shore. In Imitation of the Thirteenth Elegy of the IVth Book of Tibullus. In early youth Clorinda's chains I wore, And still unchang'd the lovely fair adore; No other female charms have pow'r to please, And make me languish in inglorious ease; No other nymph in country, town, or court, Where gentle belles, and gentler beaux resort, Tho' practis'd in the soft inveigling art, Can boast a conquest o'er my faithful heart. May the bright lustre of her sparkling eyes Have pow'r to make no other slave her prize! May no conceited fop her favour boast, But think she scarce deserves to be a toast! Bless'd with the presence of this lovely maid, I'd leave the world, and seek some lonely shade; Her charms would cast a round refulgent light, And gild the dusky horrors of the night. In her sweet converse ages I could pass, Nor wish old time to shake his sandy glass. When false to this dear idol of my soul, The needle shall not tremble to the pole. Tho' Venus crown'd with her immortal charms Should condescend to court me to her arms, Her art divine would ineffectual prove, Nor could her beauty make me change my love. Fool that I am my passion to reveal, And let Clorinda know the pangs I feel! The haughty fair will triumph in my pain, And with contempt her lover's vows disdain: Yet will I love, nor cherish black despair, But wait till nature make her kind as fair. A Song to Clorinda. Clorinda, why this coy restraint, This force upon your nature? That love is strong, and reason faint, Appears in every feature. No longer then hoard up your charms, As misers do their gold! But fly into your lover's arms, Nor fear reproach till old. If virtue is a friend to love, As ancient sages taught, We then by force of reason prove, To love is not a fault. The Patriot. Curse on the sordid miser's lust of gold, By whom his country's interest is sold, Auletes cries! and with a patriot's voice Declares, or liberty, or death's my choice. But when a statesman whispers in his ear, Your vote shall gain a thousand pound a year; With an obsequious bow, he thanks his grace, And wonders how he could mistake the case. The Toast. Let infidels be dumb! Fill high my glass! Fair Dashwood proves an atheist is an ass: None but a Deity such art could boast To form so gay, so beautiful a toast. From Catullus. When Bellamira swears, that gentle love Has fix'd her mind incapable to rove; The fleeting passion of the fickle fair Should be describ'd in sand, or writ in air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A View of the Town, a Satire. In an Epistle to a Friend in the Country. To you, who love to range the sylvan scene, And taste the pleasure of a mind serene, These lines are sent in a familiar strain To show what fashionable vices reign. Fortune has thee to happier scenes convey'd: By nature fit for contemplation made, There live content; explore her secret laws, And neither meet with censure or applause. When no rough storms the ruffled ocean sweep, But Halcyon calms sit brooding o'er the deep, The shipwreck'd merchant's wealth securely lies, Except the vent'rous diver seize the prize: But, when loud whirlwinds rage and billows roar, The seas discharge their spoils upon the shoar: Thus adverse fortune will your merit prove, And show the virtues of the man I love. As when fell One of the chief managers of the charitable corporation. Thomson was to justice brought To suffer vengeance for each flagrant fault, The silent court suspended stood, nor knew Which of his crimes was of the blackest hue; So here such various follies rush to light, That seek in vain the covert of the night, Astonish'd at the bold degenerate age I doubt which vices first deserve my rage. Where kings with pomp their dignity maintain, There satire never points her sting in vain; For men of merit once the gay resort, When virtue was in fashion e'en at court: But now the magic of its circle draws Such worthless slaves, as tremble at the laws, And fear on earth their persecuting rod More than the wrath of an offended God. Pimps, b?ps, pathics, parasites attend: Each vice still finds some patron for a friend, While injur'd merit like a suppliant waits, And begs in vain admittance at the gates. Since prelates claim preheminence of place, First let me brand those zealots with disgrace. Priests that are arm'd with virtue need not fear, Whose actions can the test of conscience bear; Secure in native innocence they sit, Unwounded by the satires that are writ. Tho' laws severe to punish guilt are made, What honest man is of those laws afraid? All felons against judges will exclaim, As harlots startle at a Gonson's name. In former times, e're virtue was a fault, When blushing merit for preferment sought, Men who profess'd religion were esteem'd As messengers of God, and sacred deem'd: At length, dissolv'd in luxury and ease, Proud to command, and negligent to please, They gave weak consciences such rigid rules, Which, if observ'd, had made them passive fools; Chalk'd out the path that leads to perfect bliss, Which none, whose gifts were large, could ever miss. Thus did their wily arts the world deceive, And none could go to heaven without their leave. But modern spintexts daily grow refin'd, And with each modish vice adorn the mind. Religion they profess, I grant it true, But worldly lucre is the prize in view. Divinity is now become a trade; They only serve their God in masquerade. Hypocrisy, that bastard of their zeal, Serves as a veil base actions to conceal. Assisted by this pious artifice They sin, nor are their characters the price. Now pamper'd prelates leave the toil of pray'r To those, who think salvation worth their care; Far other views their sordid thoughts engage, Afraid to lash the vices of the age. Preferment is the aim of abject tools, Who forfeit honesty to flatter fools. How can such men, by holy orders bound To tread on none but consecrated ground, In sable troops to splendid courts advance, To quaff rich wines, or throng the midnight dance? Or else attend the levees of the great, Scorn'd e'en by courtiers and the pimps of state, And, if their patron is a Deist thought, Abjure the miracles our Saviour wrought? When such are preachers of the gospel made, How can religion fail to droop her head? Tho' priests in pulpits thunder out aloud Damnation to the unbelieving croud; Describe the pleasures which from virtue flow, And teach that vice will terminate in woe: Shall the gay libertine reform his life, Or cease to languish for another's wife; If the whole week beside these zealous fools Confute by practice all their sabbath rules? Tho' such the base corrupted lives of those, Whose bad examples are religion's foes; And give advantage to the weaker sort, To make the sacred writ their midnight sport: Tho' jests are broke, and pointed libels writ With all the rage and virulence of wit; Men of unblemish'd characters will thrive, Fierce envy and detraction both survive; Unsully'd truth shine forth with purer ray; And learned infidels the church obey. Satire, like a true mirrour to the fair, Shows not what we affect, but what we are; Plucks from the splendid courtier all disguise, And sets the real man before our eyes: If base designs are lurking in his heart, To point them out is sure an honest part. As paint adorns the fair, whom nature gave Charms scarce sufficient to make one their slave; So flatt'ry casts a dazzling light on those Whose deeds are dark, and a false fame bestows. Let all, whose groveling souls can condescend To smile upon a foe, or curse a friend, Frequent the court! there they may chance to find Fops, whom they never saw, extremely kind, To raise them to high places proffer aid, Till the fond ideots think their fortune made; Then show what soothing speech the great beguiles, And thus instruct them in the courtier's wiles: âReligion, virtue, conscience, and such things âAre not fit converse for the ears of kings. âWould you succeed, such topics will not find âThe least attention from your patron's mind; âThe court divines have banish'd them our isle, âThen learn to talk in a more pleasing style. âConsider first the temper of his Grace, âWhat darling vices celebrate his race. âIf a young nobleman of sprightly fire âDetermin'd to indulge each loose desire, âOn fornication panegyrics make, âAnd swear his lordship's the most finish'd rake âThat ever revell'd in the arms of This pretty lady being very much chagrin'd, that her name should rhime to pox, in the former edition; the author has condescended to alter it for the line here inserted, which he presumes will give her no offence. Cox, âPride of the Mall, and splendor of the box. âLet the foul rape of Lucrece be your theme: âIn rapture,âwhen you talk of Tarquin, seem: âLet him the founder of hot lust be stil'd, âBy whom the chastest matron was defil'd: âOr else the wisdom of the Romans praise, âAnd let the Sabine rape adorn your lays. âSuch wanton tales as these with fire record, âFit subjects to delight a courtly lord. âBut those, whose mercenary souls adore âThe bright refulgence of the shining ore, âWho think all happiness consists in wealth, âAnd seek it before honour, virtue, health; âSuch vulgar souls require another tale, âAnd you must seem as sordid to prevail: âFor 'tis a frailty common to us all âTo prize in others, what our minds enthrall. As many vassals as these arts have won, So many helpless wretches are undone. Observe the characters of men: how few The path, which nature points them out, pursue! Macrinus cast in a soft tender mould With Bacchanalians longs to be enroll'd, With midnight revellers affects to join, And emulates the jovial God of wine. Robusto takes a contrary extreme: A heavy lumpish mass made up of phlegm, Duller than mortals of Promethean clay E'er yet enlighten'd with celestial ray; Genteel as birth-day beaux affects to move, And thinks himself the quintessence of love. The fondest wish his tender heart can frame, To be familiar with a city dame, Or else with some coquet beyond her prime, Or Betty Careless, languish out his time; From pilfer'd novels Messalina court; The fair's aversion, and the wife man's sport. But, if unluckily his stars ordain The wanton nymph indulgent to his pain, The fop starts back, nor would his strength employ, Tho' fairer than the shining curse of Troy: Such coxcombs love a theory intrigue, But think the practice is too much fatigue. As spangled glow-worms glitter in the night, But vanish at the rosy dawn of light: So gaudy fops are at a distance priz'd, But, soon as known, their emptiness despis'd; Like insects basking in a summer's ray Flutter a while, then unobserv'd decay. Ask gay Petronius, why that crazy mien, That down-cast look as if devour'd with spleen? A wife defil'd? a son or brother drown'd? No,âworse than that he criesâSir Robert frown'd. Such mean ambition, such a servile part, Betrays as weak a head, as foul a heart. From such a line descend that tinsel race, Who never know their friends except in lace; Brocaded suits their very souls can gain, But, if unluckily your cloaths are plain, They turn their empty heads another way, And would not meet you for the world that day. Such is their vanity, and such their rules, Where lords and dukes preserve you from the fools! As I was lately saunt'ring in the Park, I chanc'd to meet with such a modish spark, Who thus accosted me: my life! my soul! By heaven I'm yours unto the farthest poleâ Command me, sir;âI have his lordship's ear, And can promote your interest,ânever fear! When luckily a gaudy fop pass'd by, Sudden the glaring insect takes his eye, He begs my pardon, trips away in haste, In hopes of being in the Mall embrac'd. Blanditius,endow'd with common sense, To the whole world his favours will dispense; The wise, the fool, the witling, and the knave From his impartial tongue like praises have: So the refulgent source of light displays On all mankind his universal rays. If Pult'ney's speeches for his country's good Of foul corruption stem the rapid flood; Instruct the senate with persuasive tongue, How to redress an injur'd nation's wrong; Nor let deluded millions fall a prey To factious rage, or arbitrary sway: Or some Sejanus blast his good designs, And dig the nation's ore from Sylla's mines: Ask good Blanditius, which deserves your blame, Who bears a patriot's, or a Walpole's name? He'll answer you, that both are worthy men, And neither of their characters condemn: So Stoics think all vices are the same, And that they only differ in the name. Plague me, ye Gods, with all your ills in store; Or leave me worse than an abandon'd whore! Let every fool, and knave, and parasite Detect me, loath me, curse me, while I write! Sooner than like a sycophant to praise Such fops, as merit birch instead of bays. My soul abhors to sooth exalted pride, To give those parts, whom nature has deny'd; To cringe before a minister of state; Pawn honour, conscience, virtue, to be great; In servile phrase to flatter, to adore The meanest of mankind, because in pow'r: Such terms as these each honest heart disdains, Tho' Sylla's plunder should reward his pains. These are ill-natur'd critics on my life, Who love like friends to raise domestic strife; To make the follies of unguarded youth Feel the dire anguish of the serpent's tooth, Had not a tender parent's kind regard Baffled their malice, and beat down their guardâ! But let such groveling reptiles crawl on earth, Or sink to hell which gave their actions birth: If Bingham, Bysse, or Barthurst should applaud, The bounteous Withers, or the friendly Rod, Tho' some may hate, I triumph in the quarrels With George's, Heaton's, Hudd'sford, and Ducarell's. That source of evil, from whose poison'd streams Flows the dire mischief which your friend o'erwhelms, Shall feel the wrath of an offended muse, Who can, if injur'd, let her satire loose. Sinon, that proverb for a villain's name! A sordid speaking wretch unknown to fame, Whose character would poetry debase, And bring the heaven-born muse to vile disgrace; Else would I set him in a stronger light, Did not his actions best become the night: Scorn'd by the meanest of mankind himself, Who would renounce, his God for sordid pelf: Who is,âyet dares not to appear your foe, But soothing strikes, and would excuse the blow; Like ratgut foaming beer not worth a groat, Smiles specious in your face, and cuts your throat. So wily Satan seem'd the friend of Eve, (And by such means e'en woman could deceive) Till, having compass'd what his arts design'd, He triumph'd in the ruin of mankind. For such a wretch, 'tis charity to pray: In dark oblivion let his actions lay, Nor feel the vengeance of a judgment-day! Like a mere brute be doom'd to perish whole, And by annihilation save his soul. I love the man, who boldly speaks his thought, Nor gilds with flattery each glaring fault; Who dares chastise the vices of a court, Tho' arbitrary laws their pow'r support. Like The honourable George Talbot. Talbot generous, whose actions grace The high descent of his illustrious race, Fond to oblige, unwilling to offend, To honour, virtue, and mankind a friend. Tho' satire flows from my envenom'd pen To brand with infamy the worst of men, Where worth like Godfrey Clarke, Esq; of Derbyshire. Clarke's appears, I love to praise; Such merit consecrates the poet's lays. Tho' bounteous, prudent, splendid, yet not proud; By worth, not wealth, distinguish'd from the croud; No friends distress'd in vain reveal their wants, Before the modest blush to askâhe grants; By whom desire of wealth is understood, But as a larger pow'r of doing good. Such noble qualities exalt the mind Above the sordid race of human kind. Perhaps a despicable race of men Expect the female sex should feel my pen; The charms of beauty all their faults excuse, And claim protection from a youthful muse. But there is one by nature form'd to please, Born to excel, and captivate with ease; Some bright auspicious planet rul'd her birth, Gay without guilt, and innocent with mirth; Too lavish nature, bounteous of her store, Bestow'd such charms as make the world adore. But yet this fair one, whom mankind admire, Sighs for a coxcomb with unfeign'd desire, Commends his person, doats upon his name, And parlies on the very brink of fame; Angels may fall,âbut, should her virtue fail, I shall believe that all the sex are frail. O Pope! thou scourge to a licentious age, Inspire these lines with thy severest rage! Arm me with satire keen as Oldham wrote, Against the curs'd Divan with poignant thought, To lash a crime, which filthy lechers use (Sworn foes to mother Haywood and the stews) Inverting nature to a foul design, They stop the propagation of their kind. Forlorn Saphira, with reclining head, Sighs for her absent lord in bridal bed: He to St. James's Park with rapture flies, And roams in search of some fair ingle prize; Courts the foul pathic in the fair one's place, And with unnat'ral lust defiles his race. From whence could such polluted wretches spring? How learn to propagate so foul a thing? The sons of Sodom were destroy'd by fire; Gommorrah felt the Lord's destructive ire; The great metropolis of England's isle Burnt like a guilty nation's fun'ral pile; Bold race of men!âwhom nothing can affright, Not e'en their consciences in dead of night. Let Jesuits some subtler pains invent, For hanging is too mild a punishment! Let them lie groaning on the racking wheel, Or feel the tortures of the burning steel! Whips, poisons, daggers, inquisitions, flames; This crime the most exalted vengeance claims: Or else be banish'd to some desart place, And perish in each other's foul embrace. 'Tis strange this sin should flourish in our isle, Where sea-born Venus and the Graces smile; Where tender virgins in the bloom of youth Are fam'd for virtue, innocence, and truth, With all the charms that nature can provide For the gay mistress, or the lovely bride. Can yet this savage race obdurate prove, And beauty have no pow'r their hearts to move To the warm transports of a female love? By such foul slaves our species is disgrac'd, And may they all be damn'd for want of taste! Such are the reigning vices:âStill the muse Thro' the world's labyrinth some path should chuse, To make me happy till my latest breath, And lead me thro' the silent vale of death; There soon the transitory scene must end, Where vice repines that virtue finds a friend. In splendid servitude let others shine, Fair liberty and calm content be mine! To live below the grandeur of the great, And yet above contempt, in humble state: To learn in youth to value men of worth, For merit,ânot the greatness of their birth; Nor give a blind applause to fools of blood, Who draw their pedigree from Noah's flood. To read what books, converse with whom I please, Not lead a life of indolence,âbut ease; Boldly to speak my sentiment, nor fear Lest rigid truth offend a courtier's ear; To laugh at coxcombs, turn to ridicule The birth-day beau, or self-enamour'd fool: To make a One of the King's chaplains, who perhaps is willing to forget his ill usage of the author, who will take care to remind him of it in some of the following pages. Holmes or This other fellow must be conscious of his iniquity, and the kind treatment he has reason to expect from me, which he shall receive in due proportion. Hudd'sford rot in rhime, (If such a verse remain to future time) Who now may curse that inauspicious hour, They made bad use of arbitrary pow'r; Ambition's wreck, the pride of upstart fools, Which plunges in destruction those it rules. But if the mad disease of rhime invite, Or wrongs provoke an injur'd muse to write, To public taste submit each honest page, Nor court the reigning judges of the age; Whose whim and caprice settle sterling wit, In vain without their praise a poem's writ: But if they smile upon a worthless line, Stamp'd with their seal, it passes for divine. Thus may I live, with conscience ever gay, And innocently trifle life away! Till my last sand of fleeting time is run, And then thank Heaven that my journey's done. An Epistle to a Gentleman at Oxford. Where Cam in silver streams thro' meadows glides, Far from Clorinda's sight your friend resides; Far from the happy scenes, which once I knew Till the mean wretch his poison'd arrows threw, And banish'd me from Langton, Loveling, You; Fiends have like him a licence to do ill, But good is neither in their pow'r or will. Emblem of human life your letter came With news, which tears of grief and rapture claim; What!âtho' my conscious heart her charms commend, My sorrow's greater for so dear The death of Mr. John Bingham, student of Christ-Church in Oxford. friend: Beauty gives pleasure like a wanton dream, But friendship guides us thro' life's troubled stream; Fair nymphs like syrens fleeting joys impart, But a friend's welfare reaches to the heart. When stormy passions in our bosoms roll, And dark despair quite desolates the soul, The balm of friendship heals the wounded breast, And lulls our sorrows to a state of rest. Here free from tyranny (in pedants phrase, Good discipline to point out wisdom's ways) Careful of ease, and negligent of fame, I sacrifice no pleasure for a name; Enjoy the liberty which nature gave, Nor condescend to be to fools a slave: Sometimes peruse great Edward's shining page, Which casts reproach on this inglorious age: Or read with rapture Pope's immortal line, In whose strong page so many beauties shine; Who, arm'd for virtue, holds it for a rule, To spare no noble knave or wealthy fool; Or else in midnight revels care beguile, And taste tumultuous pleasure for a while; Then consecrate a bumper to my toast, The fairest nymph the British isle can boast; None blush to fall a victim to her eyes, For Dashwood's name all excellence implies. Now nymphs descended of a noble race Will court the judgment of the Miss Dashwood was chose this year lady patroness of the Highborlace Club in Oxford. Highborlace Who by so nice a choice their taste approve, As shows their hearts susceptible of love. Thus all her leisure hours he muse employs, While fancy paints imaginary joys, Lives o'er the gayer scene of pleasure past, And owns such happiness too great to last. But long epistles writ in rhime displease, And the last sentence gives the reader ease; So with a wish sincere, my friend adieu, That all life's blessings may descend on you.

      <field name="fulltext">The Campaign of Valencia. âOh! let me speak it with a Roman spirit! âWe were receiv'd, like undone prodigals âBy curs'd ingrateful stewards, with cold looks, âWho still got all by those poor wretches ruin: âLike malefactors at the hands of justice. âIf thus receiv'd! How paid our long arrears? âWhyâas entrusted misers pay the rights âOf helpless orphans, or the widow's tears. âO soldier! for to thee, to thee, I speak it, âBawds for the drudgery of citizens wives âWould better pay debilitated stallions.â The Campaign of Valencia. To vindicate an injur'd patriot's name, And from the blast of envy guard his fame; For this each honest muse should prune her wing, And teach our bards heroic worth to sing: Nor longer prostitute their venal lines To varnish o'er a Sylla's dark designs; To flatter statesmen in their fulsome lays, Like Gazetteers their wond'rous conduct praise, Make war's dire conflicts cease at their command, And peaceful olives grace each happy land. Far from such sordid arts the muses strive To make a British hero's fame survive, Great Peterborough's glory to recite, To set his merit in a blaze of light, Too long conceal'd in thickest clouds of night. Here fiction need not seek for fancy's aid, Nor call with rapture on Pierian maid; In truth's plain dress great actions brightest shine, Nor borrow lustre from an artful line. When France aspiring to extend her sway, And make the vassal world her laws obey, Projected schemes, in an ill-omen'd hour, To gain her monarch universal pow'r; To fix the crown of Spain on Lewis' head, And make all Europe his ambition dread: (Designs, like these, the Bourbon race inspire, And monarchy becomes their sole desire.) The love of pleasure and inglorious ease, The court of Venus could no longer please; Bellona's rage their ardent thoughts employ, And make their bosoms glow with horrid joy. Now swift-wing'd Fame, attended by Report, Declar'd their schemes to the Iberian court. Struck with amazement at the fatal news, Charles trembled at their vast unbounded views; Revolv'd within his mind the dire event, And to the camp disclos'd their bold intent. Thro' all his realms a panic fear was spread; And horror smil'd to see the nation's dread. Now Charles in solemn council held debate Against the pride of France to guard the state. Each, with a noble thirst of glory fir'd, To have the conduct of the war requir'd; Their naked breasts expos'd to public sight, Show'd the rough scars receiv'd in open fight: Till thus he spoke, âLet emulation cease, âAnd reason each aspiring thought appease! âYou seem to thirst for glory, not for blood, âPreferring honours to your country's good: âHave you forgotten Peterborough's care, âHis conduct in the Barcelona war? âBy what nice stratagem the fort was won, âWhen such superior force possess'd the town! âIngratitude would brand the crown of Spain, âDid not he lead our army to the plain: âFrance has already felt his dire alarms, âSure vengeance follows his destructive arms, âDeath, rage, and slaughter wait on his command, âAnd crouch for fell employment from his hand.â Each Spaniard, conscious of superior worth, Declin'd the leading of their army forth, To Peterborough's care the task resign'd, To crush ambition by the Gods design'd. Their choice confirm'd, ambassadors were sent To Mordaunt, to reveal the King's intent, âThat the late armies whom he thought subdu'd, âAnd with unweary'd diligence pursu'd, âRally'd their scatter'd forces in the flight, âAnd burn'd impatient for a second fight.â Encamp'd before Mattheo's walls, the foe Threaten'd to lay her haughty turrets low; To vanquish'd slaves no quarter to afford, But give them up to the destructive sword. Great Peterborough's soul was mov'd with grief, And vow'd with utmost speed to bring relief; Already touch'd with pity seem'd to hear The orphan's cry, and mourn each widow's tear. No thirst of fond ambition to be great, To swell in pomp, and shine a wretch in state, Rous'd him to arms, or drew him to the field: But to make each invasive tyrant yield; To save the weak from the oppressor's force, And let impartial justice take her course. When generous motives such a hero move, The welfare of mankind his actions prove; Contending nations join in his applause, Whose glorious deeds support the common cause. When dangers threaten, and impending fate Charg'd with destruction, hovers o'er a state, 'Tis then the godlike qualities, that form A hero, struggle with the rising storm: In peace a N?s rides in Neptune' car, But Vernon guides the thunder of the war. Thus when rebellion rear'd her impious head, The sport of France and Rome, the nation's dread, Our Generals abash'd, no longer stood Before these sons of rapine bath'd in blood; Till the brave genius of our isle arose To check the rapid progress of our foes; To drive these upstart warriors from the land, Who fled before the youth's victorious hand: But, when they breathe again their native air, Their drooping hopes revive from dark despair; Their scatter'd forces, near the banks of Spey, Resolve to stand the fortune of the day, Where mighty Cumberland, ordain'd by fate To scourge rebellion, and preserve the state, Swift thro' their thickest ranks like lightning flew, And vanquish'd with his arms the rebel crew. Thus England, rescu'd from the foulest shame That ever tainted her victorious name, With loud repeated shouts resounds his praise, Whose valour could her sinking glory raise; Applauding senates show their just regard, Soon after the battle of Culloden, which was the sixteenth of April, 1746, the parliament gave an additional sum of twenty-five thousand a year to the Duke, for his signal service in extirpating the rebellion. And with rich gifts his blooming worth reward. What anxious cares revolve within his breast To raise the weak, and succour the distress'd? His firm associates pensive round him wait To hold on liberty's dear cause debate. When thus great Peterborough silence broke, âIberia shudders at the Gallic yoke, âBefore MatthÃ©o's walls aspiring France âWith fresh recruited troops their arms advance; âAnd should that town surrender (dreadful thought) âOr by their swords be to submission brought, âHow would that conquest further their design, âAnd cloud the glory of the Austrian line? âAs floods, let loose from their determin'd bound, âWith deluges the fertile fields surround; âSo would their forces, rushing o'er the plain, âExtend their conquest thro' the realms of Spain. âBy force, our army never can oppose âThe pow'rs that strengthen our united foes; âTheir crouded legions cover all the strand, âAnd strike a sudden terror o'er the land: âAffrighted nations dread extended sway, âFor fear their kingdoms should become a prey. âTo stop the torrent of this rapid flood, âE'en envy would confess a public good: âWhat then remains, but stratagems to try, âAnd not upon our army's strength rely? âMatthÃ©o's walls with dismal cries abound, âAnd fell despair reverberates the sound; âBereft of hope, their gates expanded wide âWill yield a passage to the hostile tide, âUnless our couriers can the town persuade âTo wait in firm expectance of our aid.â Assembled warriors his designs approve, And bless the counsel of the man they love. Now couriers, swift in speed as rapid fire, With chearful hopes their fainting souls inspire, Who spread among their troops a false report, That to his standard strong allies resort, And the next dawn of morning would disclose Numbers superior to his vaunting foes. Soon as the sun, from his meridian height Declining, left his empire to the night, Our army marches on with silent pace Thro' sable darkness to the destin'd place: Within Traguera's walls his forces lay, Big with expectance of approaching day. Great Peterborough scorn'd inglorious rest, While bold invaders all the land infest; The dire event of war His mind employs, Averse to pleasure and its fleeting joys. The hardy soldiers, spent with rugged toil, In golden dreams enjoy the wish'd-for spoil. Soon as the morn in purple dawn arose, Each warrior started from his soft repose; His valiant troops, in martial pomp array'd, Their ensigns to the adverse host display'd. With horror struck, They scarce believe their eyes, Unmanly fears in every breast arise; And thus the Gallic Chief his troops bespoke: âHow shall we ward this unexpected stroke? âCurse on the Spanish monarch's shrewd design âTo chuse a hero from the British line, âWhose conduct artful stratagems can frame, âAnd with determin'd sword observance claim! âShould we, like the rebellious sons of Jove, â(Who rose in arms against the pow'rs above) âPresume the thunder of the foe to stand, âWhile under Peterborough's brave command? âWhat fortune could the boldest think to share, âBut death, destruction, horror, or despair? âThen let us fly from this impending blow, âNor glut with slaughter the devouring foe!â Confed'rate hosts approve his fears, and fly Swift as Jove's lightning darting thro' the sky; Fear gave them wings: by cowardice betray'd, They seek in distant regions further aid. Great Peterborough's soul disdain'd to own An easy conquest without slaughter won. His murm'ring soldiers curse their dastard host, To have the glory of the battle lost. MatthÃ©o's walls with thund'ring cannons roar; No sad complaints their wretched state deplore; Exulting joy sits smiling in each face, Despair and meagre famine fly the place; Congratulating crouds the victor meet, And prostrate fall before the hero's feet; Their eyes, o'erflowing with a generous tear, The guardian of their liberties revere. While joyful acclamations rend the skies, And Spain on Peterborough's care relies, Advice arrives, that other cities dread The common foe, and wish him at their head; That Anjou's forces laid the country waste, Their churches raz'd, and images defac'd; Whose oath decreed the Bourbon line should reign, And Charles in exile mourn his conquer'd Spain; That a dark gloom of horror seizes all, And France's slaughter'd sons for vengeance call; That Catalonia saw their troops from far, And trembled at the distant din of war. So when our English fleet has plow'd the main, The product of some foreign clime to gain, With riches fraught, in sight of harbour sails, Their canvas wings distent with happy gales; The billows roar, and sudden storms arise; Thick clouds of darkness spread before their eyes; They view, with longing hopes, the neighb'ring strand, And fear a shipwreck in the sight of land. Great Peterborough's soul by danger try'd, Not on his numbers, but his cause rely'd; Summon'd a council, and with steady thought, What conduct should be follow'd, wisely sought. Some in debate with earnest zeal declare Valencia, for the bloody scene of war; While others Catalonia's fate deplore, Which conquest would increase their growing pow'r. Thus various sentiments their hearts divide, But Peterborough's thoughts their actions guide: When thus the hero spoke, âYour monarch's life âDemands our presence, and concludes the strife; âIf my resolve determine the debate, âWe should assist the Catalonian state: âReport confirms, that, by the close of night, âTo Nules the vanquish'd urg'd their rapid flight, âWhich disaffected town receives those slaves, âAnd Gallic troops from English fury saves; âScorns to be subject to your Austrian liege, âWell fortify'd to stand a vigorous siege: âShould our strong engines, like Jove's thunder, make âTheir turrets from their firm foundations shake, âNumbers superior to our troops remain âTo stand an open battle on the plain: âYet Nules we must with violence assail, âAnd lay their turrets equal with the vale. âPerhaps these sons of war, with swift-wing'd flight âWho shunn'd the danger of a glorious fight, âCurs'd from their birth with an aspiring mind, âBy nature slaves to tyranny design'd! âWho bear war's rugged discipline and toil, âNot for the hopes of liberty,âbut spoil; âWhen they behold our troops in just array âAgainst the walls intrepid urge their way, âLife blasted with contempt may sooner chuse, âThan dare to prosecute ambition's views.â Tho' some the rashness of his counsel blame, Yet more with shouts their loud assent proclaim; Nor did his bold conjectures prove in vain. Soon as his army glitter'd on the plain, Their dastard forces left the trembling town, And all alliances with Nules disown. But what did this avail? Their strengthen'd tow'rs Could stand secure against united pow'rs. What then remains? With long fatigues o'ercome, His soldiers, wishing for their native home, In moving terms with earnest zeal implore, To view with longing eyes the British shore. Firm to his purpose, Peterborough thought, That conquest with his blood was cheaply bought; Collected in himself, resolv'd alone By a bold stratagem to gain the town; Then to their gates like war's intrepid God, Secure of fate, in martial pomp he rode. The foe, astonish'd at the bold design, Shudder'd with fear, nor dar'd to pass the line: When thus the godlike hero silence broke, And to their frighten'd host in thunder spoke: âInhabitants of this defenceless town, âWho build your safety on a false renown, âLet not my troops for an admission wait: âWithin six minutes ope the city gate! âElse, at the dreadful period of that time, âDestructive vengeance shall o'ertake your crime. Selected priests unfold the dismal tale, And sudden fears o'er reason's pow'r prevail; Alternate passions in their bosoms rise, And floods of tears run gushing from their eyes: When thus their chief determin'd, â'Tis too late âTo check his conquests, or support our state; âThen swift as thought the tenfold barrier burst, âAnd let us to the victor's mercy trust.â Now all their gates expanded wide behold, As if their magistrates the city sold. In awful pomp their pensive forces stand, And beg him not to sacrifice the land, Like vanquish'd senators of ancient Rome, When the proud victor spoke their fatal doom. Touch'd with compassion at the moving sight, He rais'd the suppliant, did the orphan right; To brutal lust no virgin fell a prey, No soldiers plunder'd with a tyrant's sway; But all their hero's bright example take, And the sad captives joyful subjects make. How with so weak an army to maintain The conquests, which his stratagems obtain, Requir'd e'en Peterborough's utmost care To prove successful in a future war. By his command such false reports were spread, That thousands were pursuing those that fled: Thus by his conduct, and intrepid law, Almost alone he kept the world in awe. But now reflecting in his anxious mind, How many various toils remain behind; His harrass'd troops with labour worn away, Without supplies, his cavalry's decay: Necessities like these demand relief, And break the slumbers of our anxious chief. Yet, by his happy conduct in a town, Which scarcely did the victor's triumph own, He form'd a cavalry, then march'd away, To meet some forces which at distance lay. His officers on Oropesa's plain Had long expected his return in vain, When from afar their longing eyes behold Their much-lov'd hero clad in burnish'd gold; Reviving hopes their drooping spirits warm, And distant dangers have the pow'r to charm: As he approach'd, they ran with eager pace To clasp their general in a close embrace; With joy reciprocal their bosoms beat; For absence makes the pleasure more compleat. But now severer thoughts the chief engage To guard Valencia from their hostile rage: Now called Molviedro. Saguntum's walls his destin'd march oppose, The strongest bulwark of his vanquish'd foes; Before its feet the foaming surges roar, And Neptune with his trident guards the shore, With mountains on each side encompass'd round, Which fortify the city like a mound: These must be pass'd, and with incessant pain The soldiers strive the steep ascent to gain. One stratagem remains to speed his course, Which may supply the want of hostile force. The swiftest couriers by command were sent To seek Mahoni at his royal tent, To whisper in his ear, the victor thought That peace might flourish without battles fought, If both should on parole of honour meet, And of the public welfare fairly treat.

What ardent transports in their bosoms glow'd, When they beheld from far their guardian God? Joyful as angels when by fiends dismay'd The great Messiah thunder'd to their aid. E'en stern ecclesiasticks laid aside (To welcome him) their ruling passion, pride; Gaz'd on his form, in admiration lost, And strove with zeal who should applaud him most. Thus by his conduct, and incessant toil, He reap'd the victory without the spoil: The house of Austria seated on a The kingdom of Valencia. throne By conquests, which a British subject won. Great is his glory, greater England's shame, To blast with censure that illustrious name. While crouds revile (mean refuse of a court) The guardian of their laws, their chief support: When merit finds from princes no regard, 'Tis then that virtue is its own reward. May some auspicious bard arise to save Those great exploits from time's eternal grave!

But such the spirit of the laureat's odes, His glowing lines can make mere mortals Gods: Sound thro' the world Britannia's high renown, And make France tremble if our CÃ¦sar frown.

Erat homo ingeniosus, acutus, &amp; acer, qui plurimum &amp; salis haberet, &amp; fellis, nec candoris minus. Pliny's Epistles. Tho' vain the tributary tears we shed For friends in exile, or untimely dead; When men distinguish'd for their merit die, The muses love to sing their elegy; In humble strains the mournful theme pursue, And give to friendship rigid virtue's due. What honest nature dictates void of art, With eyes o'erflowing and a bleeding heart, Free from the labour'd ornament of verse, Shall pay the tribute due to Bingham's hearse. Oh could these lines (illustrious shade) restore Life to those virtues, which are now no more! E'en His metaphysical head had a particular aversion to poetry, which he expressed on all occassions. C? would bless the sacred nine, And own their inspiration was divine. In dawn of life so strong thy merit shone, Mankind could scarce expect a brighter noon: Sure Oxford universal sorrow wears, And Isis' stream increases with her tears; Such was her grief, when Milton's Philips, author of the Splendid Sbilling, &amp;c. son expir'd, A rising genius by the world admir'd. Too partial fate will let the fool and knave Drag in contempt their beings to the grave; But like a tyrant labours to destroy All that excel in worth, or give us joy, Who shine like meteors glorious in their birth, But soon in blazing ruins sink to earth. So good Marcellus perish'd in his bloom, The rising hope and ornament of Rome, With every shining quality adorn'd, Like thee, by men of worth and virtue mourn'd. What art can reach, or science can define, Among philosophers, or wits, to shine, Without the help of flattery, was thine. Youth's giddy sons, or age severely wise, From thy sweet converse could instructed rise. Bless'd with a genius for each science fit, With strength of judgment and a ready wit: Thy copious talents would our envy move, Had not thy sweet behaviour won our love. Firm to his principles, to honour just, Faithful as guardian angels to their trust; He gave his friends and enemies their due, Above their praises and their censure too. Severe in morals, honest without art, An able head, and incorrupted heart; Possess'd of little, with a chearful mind He relish'd life, and was in death resign'd: The gay tranquillity, the heart-felt joy, Were his, which fortune never could destroy. The best companion, the sincerest friend, Rever'd in life, lamented in his end. How few like him in early youth approv'd, Admir'd by enemies, by friends belov'd! Such is the merit of an honest fame, And such the character his virtues claim. Sometimes in converse o'er the midnight bowl, When wine unfolds the secrets of the soul, When absent friends our grateful thoughts engage, Or beauties that adorn and charm this age, His sacred image damps my rising mirth, And gives to sad reflections hateful birth; Imagination paints the pleasure past, But so refin'd a bliss could never last; On every word each guest enraptur'd hung, And bless'd the genius that inspir'd his tongue. Now women, wine, nor mirth have pow'r to move, The friend that shares my soul, or fair I love; His dear remembrance strikes my troubled mind, And casts all other pleasures far behind; Then let the pensive muse resign her pen, And weep no longer o'er the best of men. On the Death of the Right Honourable Lord Castlecomer in 1736. Farewel thou blooming hope of Albion's isle, Whose converse could the cares of life beguile! Enrich'd with lively wit, with arts adorn'd, In the first scene of youth, admir'd and mourn'd; Whom Heaven repenting thought a gift too great, And early snatch'd thee to a better state; Where souls like thine, of an exalted kind, From every mean and vulgar thought refin'd, Dwell in pure regions of immortal joy, Where nothing can the high-wrought bliss destroy; Where injur'd innocence kind angels guard, And slighted virtue meets a sure reward. Lamented youth! What tears of sorrow flow? How every pensive bosom heaves with woe? While all whose breasts the tuneful nine inspire, Tho' dumb with grief, yet touch the moving lyre; In melancholy numbers void of art, Speak the sad language of an aching heart. Since the frail sisters cut thy slender thread, And you are rank'd among th' illustrious dead; Now every coxcomb's fond ambition ends, Whom vanity, or fortune, made your friends; When the mean tribe of slaves no longer wait To croud like parasites your palace-gate; The sacred muse, to friendship ever dear, O'er thy cold ashes sheds a grateful tear: 'Tis her's to pay the last sad tribute due To celebrated worth in friends like you; In humble strains to make their merit known, Or mark their virtues on the sculptur'd stone. Wandsford farewel! in whom kind nature join'd Whatever could instruct, or charm the mind; With learning candour, modesty with truth, The sage's wisdom with the fire of youth; Whose affability and winning air Could entertain a friend, or please the fair; Who made stern honour all his actions guide; Tho' nobly born, without one spark of pride; Whose glory on its own foundation stood, And claim'd no merit from descent of blood. When the gay scene of fleeting life is oe'r, And the world's vanities delight no more, The parting soul reflecting on thy death Shall yield with greater joy her latest breath; Without one struggle bid the world adieu, And wing her flight to happiness and you. The third Ode of the Second Book of Horace, addressed to my Friend Charles Beaumont. Whatever fortune, Beaumont, is thy lot, This moral maxim never be forgot! Whether the fickle Goddess smile, or low'r, To rise superior to her boasted pow'r, And spite of fate enjoy the present hour. But, if she shift the variable scene, With the same calm preserve the golden mean. Whether our days are spent in gloomy care, Or bless'd in revels with the wanton fair; Whether we curb each sally of the soul, Or feast our genius o'er the flowing bowl, Time measures out our lives with equal pace, Till every mortal runs his destin'd race. Where the tall pine and poplar branch unite, And without heat admit the friendly light; Where silver streams in clear meanders glide, And gently murmur as they roll their tide: There let some Ganymede fresh chaplets bring, The short-liv'd glories of the blooming spring; There in gay converse, while the fates permit, Indulge the joys of wine, and flights of wit: For soon you must resign the purchas'd grove, The stately fabric, and the nymph you love. Your cumulated riches prove the share Of some detested wife, or spend-thrift heir. What!âtho' we vainly should derive our blood From distant chronicles beyond the flood; Or with humility confess it run From some mean parent to his meaner son; The same impartial fate o'erwhelms us all: Fools, knaves, and heroes, undistinguihs'd fall. The Eleventh Ode of the Second Book of Horace, addressed to a Gentleman at Cambridge. What makes the haughty Spaniards rise in arms, And France aspiring kindle war's alarms: While hostile armies in dire conflict join, And slaughter bath'd in blood defiles the Rhine? Ask not, my friend! but with the sprightly bowl Chear the sad anguish of your drooping soul; Nor let the protect of a future ill Restrain your pleasure, or controul your will. The blooming beauty of your youth will fly, As sudden storms o'ercast the clearest sky; Cold hoary age succeeds with aching pains, And chills the sprightly blood within your veins: Then every wanton hope, and gay desire, Will with declining youth too soon expire; E'en sleep, that solace to a troubled breast, Flies from old age, nor lulls its cares to rest. Fair Henry's blooming charms too soon will fade, And waining beauty bring Philander aid; Tho' wanton love now revels in her eye, And rash admirers gaze, tho' sure to die. Check not with thought the gay desires of youth, In quest of lucre, or in search of truth! But in high spirits fill the sparkling glass, And drink a bumper to some fav'rite lass! 'Tis wine that dissipates the cares of life, A perjur'd mistress, or a scolding wife; A jealous friend, a mean insulting foe, And every moving circumstance of woe. What youth will temperate the heated wine, And make it fit to drink, before we dine? Or beckon with another harlot's fan Across the Mall to gay lascivious A woman's name. Man? Nor let the wanton stay to curl her hair, Decently lewd, and negligently fair; But let the syren bring her artful lyre, To raise our passions, and increase their fire. Thus pleasure shall improve each fleeting hour, And fix our happiness within our pow'r. An Epistle to the Honourable Henry Bathurst, Esq; Member of Parliament for Cirencester in Gloucestershire. To thee, dear Bathurst, this epistle's sent To tell you how my leisure hours are spent; To show what passions in my bosom roll, Unfold my heart, and open all my soul. You know I held it always for a rule, To loath a villain, and despise a fool; Nor court the vulgar for their weak applause, To sooth my vanity, or aid my cause. Still the same course my steady soul pursues, Firm to my friend, my mistress, and the muse: Nor can o'er midnight lamps with thought grow pale, To tell the world what wretched mortals ail; What foul disease is working in their veins, When the sick groan beneath their racking pains. Hippocrates and Galen are not read, But Horace, Ovid, Virgil, in their stead; And Juvenal, whose manly spirit glows With sharp-edg'd satyr against virtue's foes: Vice flies before him, while his honest page Paints in strong colours a corrupted age; A Messalina, reeking from the stews, Improves the force of his satyric muse; In vain her actions seek the gloom of night, Drawn by his pen in an immortal light. Since human life's extent is scarce a span, And few the transitory joys of man; How vain their toil, who spend their early days In painful study for immortal praise? Who search the Grecian, and the Roman store, And the vast depth of sciences explore; Not that the mind should be to virtue wrought, To raise the soul, or elevate the thought; To make mankind with equal scorn abhor The ridicule of want, and pride of pow'r; But like mean wretches prostitute their parts, To serve weak heads, or base corrupted hearts; To sooth ambition, or to flatter pride, And make the lust of gold their actions guide; To sell their country's glory for a post, Enjoy the spoil, nor mourn their honour lost: When such the motives, their superior sense Proves a mere bawd to some despotic prince. As women to whom lavish nature gave Charms that can make the coldest heart their slave, When once they deviate from virtue's rules, And sacrifice their modesty to fools, Each added beauty makes their guilt the more; For still the fairest is the greatest whore. While your bark fails life's navigable stream, Let your just principles remain the same! Let strictest honour be your firm support, And for a pension scorn to cringe at court! Fearless of censure act a Roman part, And boldly speak the dictates of your heart; Long may you live to make your virtues known, And prove your country's interest your own. Peterhouse, Cambridge, April 14, 1737. Paul's-Walden. A Poem addressed to my Uncle, Edward Gilbert, Esq. While stretch'd at ease beneath thy sylvan shade, I call the sacred muses to my aid, Where lavish nature charms the ravish'd sight, To set her beauties in the fairest light; Accept the tribute of a grateful heart, Who loaths the varnish of the courtier's art; But, were my genius equal to my will, Thy green retreat should rival Cowper's-hill. Far from the noisy tumult of the great, Curs'd with no mean dependance on the state, You,â to your rural solitude retire, And shun the follies which the world admire; With books and exercise the time beguile, And with a taste improve the stubborn soil, Where nature and industrious art combine With social aid each other to refine. How pleasing is the change? Where lately stood A desart's wild uncultivated wood, Where loathsome weeds and rugged brambles grew, A fair creation rises to the view; So from old Chaos, wrap'd in gloomy night, A paradise was open'd to the sight. How vain the toil of rude magnificence, To level mountains at a vast expence; Except a taste with equal lustre shine Throughout, and animate the whole design? Else stately temples rise in dreary vales, And ships in verdant trees expand their sails; Birds, tygers, elephants,â a motley crew, While heroes fight, and giants frown in yew; Where art and nature foolishly contend To frustrate,â not promote each other's end. On a small hill a decent fabric stands, Which gives a bounded prospect o'er the lands; Where waving fields of golden corn appear, The smiling product of the fruitful year. From thence behold a level verdant plain, Smooth as the surface of a halcyon main: Then circling walks their leafy shades extend, Which seem to puzzled strangers without end; Till some new scenes attract the wond'ring eyes, And with a gay variety surprize. Swift o'er the plain tho' rapid whirlwinds sweep, Like sudden tempests o'er the troubled deep; From the rough northern blast secure you walk, And scarce a murmur interrupts your talk. Lest thro' the various windings of the grove Your footsteps tire, arises an alcove; There seated, thro' a vista of the wood, Your wand'ring eye surveys a gentle flood, Where (pleasing sight) the sun's refulgent beam Glides o'er the surface of the silver stream. As you thro' various paths the walk pursue, A hermitage arises to the view; Not built to vy with Carolina's taste, Polish'd with art, with learned busto's grac'd; But unadorn'd, as suits a hermit's state, Where he might live content, and bless his fate. While thro' the mazy labyrinth you rove, The path conducts you to an orange grove, Where golden-colour'd fruit suspend the trees, And fragrant odours scent the wasting breeze. Not far beneath, a lucid fountain plays, Whose stream reflects the sun's departing rays. To change the scene, yet please with taste polite, An amphitheatre's majestic height By slow degrees above the wood ascends, And a clear prospect all around extends. When the green hill your winding footsteps gain, A temple overlooks the distant plain. On a large terras a pavilion stands, The curious work of celebrated hands. Within the dome is elegantly wrought The pictur'd labour of the artist's thought: Immortal bards from him new fame receive, And to the pleas'd spectator seem to live. First Cowley's image rises to the view, Who charms with sprightly wit for ever new; Who weary with the follies of the great, To study nature sought a calm retreat; And left the busy world to knaves and fools, In search of happiness by wisdom's rules. Next Virgil's awful form, in whose strong lines The Roman genius in full splendor shines; Whose flowing verses sooth'd Augustus' ear, And made the fair Octavia drop a tear, When he bewail'd o'er young Marcellus' tomb, His country's hope, who perish'd in his bloom. Great Dryden next, whose lofty genius rose Above the party-malice of his foes; Who, with a Juvenal's satirick rage, Lash'd the bold vice of a licentious age; Who rescu'd Virgil from the shameful brand Fix'd on him by a vile translator's hand; And made him in an English dress appear, Which Virgil living would not blush to wear. Immortal Shakespear next, whose bosom glow'd With the full inspiration of the God. What nature taught, her faithful poet drew, And open'd all her treasures to our view. Dan. Prior next, a merry bard, succeeds, Whom scarce a critic without laughter reads. He tells a merry tale with so much ease, As cannot fail the splenetic to please: Yet with what energy his lines rehearse Great Churchill's triumphs in his sounding verse? How bless'd his talent! who, with various art, On every subject captivates the heart. What numbers can poetic fancy chuse To paint the vigour of a Milton's muse? Who scorns the bounds of earth, and tow'ring soars Above the stars, and distant worlds explores; To foreign climates of his fame we boast; And mourn the less that paradise was lost. Next Homer's image rises to the sight, His eyes like Milton's veil'd in shades of night. Illustrious bard! for ever in his prime, Age after age, who triumphs over time. When Alexander read, the hero wept, (And laid him by his pillow when he slept) That no such genius in all Greece arose To sing of conquests o'er his prostrate foes, And consecrate in verse his glorious name To late posterity, the boast of fame. Peculiar beauties to each bard belong, And Orpheus finishes the tuneful throng: But hark!âthe solemn organ's swelling note Strikes on the sense, and sooths each troubled thought. Swift o'er the keys Belinda's fingers move, While fair Cecilia listens from above. As ancient poets sing, when Orpheus play'd, The savage beasts forsook the rural shade; E'en the fierce tyger innocently stood Close by the lamb, nor drank his vital blood; And ravish'd with the music of his song Inanimated forests danc'd along: But this fair nymph has the peculiar art To charm the list'ning ear, and touch the heart; Not brutes, but men, attentive round her stand, And bless the genius that directs her I shall here insert the objection an ingenious friend made to this passage, and leave the determination of it to the public, to wit, âThis passage (if I am not mistaken) seems to me to be an Anticlimax; you mentioned before the power of Orpheus's music over beasts and the inanimate creation; and afterwards, when you would commend a lady's execution on the organ, you say she has not power to charm brutes but men; which to me falls infinitely short of the excellency of Orpheus.ââ I think you are mistaken, and that it is paying the lady a greater compliment to say, that she is approved of by men of taste,â than brutes. hand. A terras walk extends for ever green, And opens to the sight a various scene. When the bright sun withdraws his parting rays, And quenches in the sea his fiery blaze, There you may walk uncover'd by the trees, O'er the smooth blade, and catch the cooling breeze. But, if the scorching dog-star's sultry heat With beams intense upon your temples beat, Thro' the wood's shady mazes you return, Secure from piercing rays, tho' Sirius burn. A palace for the busy race of bees Arises next, with various art to please, Which, rugged like the fragment of a rock, Preserves them from a sudden tempest's shock. A female regent o'er the state presides, And with impartial sway her kingdom guides. Unlike to other courts, here subjects thrive, Not by vain birth,â but merit in the hive; No private lust of gain, or deadly hate, No rage of party-faction rends the state: Each little insect breathes a patriot soul, Not for himself he labours,â but the whole. To terminate the view where vista's end, Light statues from their pedestals ascend: Such the great artist's skill, their limbs appear In just proportion, and their features clear; The various passions in their visage glow, And o'er each lively form a lustre throw.â But now the fates have chang'd the scene of bliss: Belinda marry'd equal to Your wish, Of every noble quality possess'd, To make a parent, or a husband bless'd; Whose merit will his happiness improve, To find a fair so worthy of his love: Where Gibside pours her fragrant sweets around, We seem to tread upon enchanted ground; There pendant woods adorn the river's side, Whose purling streams in gentle murmurs glide: In the bleak north, What blooming groves appear? What harmony delights the ravish'd ear? Where elegance and taste with art unite, To form so fine a scene to charm the sight. Long may you live these pleasures to enjoy, Which give true happiness, yet never cloy.</field>

Yet Stephen Duck is tolerably poor, And Colly Cibber scarce can keep a whore: The magic circle men of merit shun, Where servile fools are fond to be undone. Tibullus lives (his country's loss) retir'd, By all regretted, as by all admir'd; A genius who deserves a better fate, But droops beneath ill fortune's gauling weight: While The writers on the Hermitage. bards, that tread upon enchanted ground, Have all their works in Turky leather bound; And, further to improve the mimic scene, Adorn the study of our learned Queen. Thus Hesletine, whose music charms mankind, To the dull scene of Durham is confin'd; Where Dongworth, master of the Grecian page, Is doom'd to waste the vigour of his age, To cultivate the genius of the north, And make the sons exceed their fathers worth. Besides,âmy talent suits not with their art, Who speak a language foreign to the heart; Plain honest dealing never will offend One man, whom I could wish to be my friend; And as for sharpers, parasites, and beaux, Pimps, courtiers, knaves, I'd rather have them foes. Nor can like The reputed author of an essay on the character of the Queen. Clarke o'er all her virtues run, Who sunk in splendor like the setting sun, To rise more glorious from the womb of night, Array'd like angels in immortal light; Like Cam and Isis flow in easy verse, And weep in numbers o'er the royal herse; Invoke the muse to sing how Caroline (Religion's great defender) grew divine; That merit, which her modesty conceal'd, By Stephen's A poem of Stephen Duck's on her Majesty's death. vision, was in death reveal'd. When the strong blast of prejudice prevails, Or pining envy mourns that malice fails; Who dare against a herd of fools defend, In spite of calumny, an injur'd friend? Who scorn to truckle to be meanly great, And honour merit in a low estate; Nor prostitute their parts, or wives at court, To gain a pension's infamous support; These are the men, whose friendship I desire; Approve their converse, and their worth admire. When fools are lash'd, by sympathetic force All conscious of their folly rail of course: As, when assassins on the wheel are broke, Each dark accomplice shudders at the stroke; As Shepheard's death bath'd Newgate sons in tears, And Ward made thousands tremble for their ears; So satire makes the secret villain smart, Tho' read with pleasure by an honest heart. Let the dull pension'd race of hireling bards. Describe court virtues, as the court rewards; My pen shall never varnish o'er disgrace, To gain a great man's promise, or a place; Nor on immortal CÃ¦sar's worth refine, Here draw a Brunswic, there a Caroline, And swear they sprung from a celestial line: With panegyric swell my fulsome lays, And bribe the muses to record their praise; Alike to me, the favour or the frown Of Hudd'sford, or whom fortune gave a crown: Nor ransack ancient history to find A statesman fit to be with Walpole join'd; Make him the bulwark of our liberty, With Cecil, or at least Godolphin vy, Who has his country's interest at heart, And spite of faction acts a patriot's part; Preserves our commerce safe from shore to shore, While Europe trembles at our cannons roar; Who forms, regardless of the nation's cries, Bank contracts, or a general excise; And breaks his brain with thought to find a way, Without a sinking fund, our debts to pay; So frugal of the public treasure grown, Would make one almost think it were his own; Born for the nation's good he hoards no pelf, But loves his country better than himself. Yet, to what height his tow'ring fabrics rise, With gilded turrets glitt'ring to the skies; Splendid with gaudy furniture within, The wreck of merchants, and the spoil of sin? When to his country's seat the knight repairs, Worn out with the fatigue of state affairs, His gates expanded yield a passage free, E'en for assertors of our liberty; Each element is ransack'd of its store, To feed with French repasts the splendid poor: His sparkling cups the richest wines afford, And loyal healths flow round the chearful board; His way of life refin'd to that degree, That prelates envy him his luxury. Say to what end such jovial feasts abound, To bribe with their own wealth the country round? Now needy malecontents may cease to rail, Their vote in parliament,âor else a jail; His honour's friends, if right they play their cards, Are sure to meet with suitable rewards; His open heart such ample sums bestows, As cannot fail to influence his foes. Then whence these idle clamours of the croud Against this man so petulant and loud? As if he basely had betray'd his trust, To gratify the sordid miser's lust; Or by extortion swell'd his little store, And kept to make them slaves the nation poor. Thus calumny will rising merit blame, And cast a cloud upon the brightest fame. But still the busy prying world enquire, What vast estate was left him by his sire? If fame say true, his own revenues, clear, Amounted to four-hundred pounds a year: Then whence could such a mass of wealth arise? The nation's spoil becomes the statesman's prize: All able politicians must be paid For councils held, and foreign treaties made; Money for secret services of state, To screen him from an injur'd nation's hate: And sure that guilty wretch, who dares to stand The scourge of history's eternal brand, Should in this world some recompence receive, And taste the fruit before he's damn'd like Eve. Nor are there wanting a mean race of men To prostitute in his behalf their pen, To cast o'er all his actions a disguise, To sooth his pride, and flatter every vice; To throw a veil before the people's sight, And blend in artful colours wrong with right; To make their patron Atlas of the crown, His will our good, his conduct our renown. To vindicate his fame, their only plea For all his guilt, he ne'er receiv'd a fee; No pensions from the courts of France and Spain His morals blacken, or his virtues stain; Why should they bribe him to promote their end, Who shew'd himself a voluntary friend? To sink the glory of the British name, Her credit lessen, and her worth defame. Were these his failings?âIf it prove no worse, His fond ambition was the nation's curse; Whose dastard counsels had not equal weight, Nor skill, to guide the chariot of the state; Like Phaeton unwilling to remove, To save the world,â till thunderstruck by Jove This fatal avarice of pow'r or gold, By which e'en patriots consciences are sold, The noble sense of liberty controuls, That great prerogative of English souls, Which our illustrious predecessors thought, Tho' with their lives and fortunes, cheaply bought; And shall we their degenerate sons betray Our glorious birth-right for a hireling's pay? First let our swords defend our country's laws, Or bravely perish in the generous cause; If we must fall, from heaven let vengeance come, And the loud thunder speak our glorious doom. As the best things are, when corrupted, worst, Mankind are often with their wishes curst. Old Gripus ne'er was known to be devout, Till Satan found his ruling passion out: But now at daily pray'rs the dotard kneels, And the false rapture of devotion feels; To build an hospital or college vows, And feed the starving beggar at his house: But, since he has obtain'd the splendid evil, His wife and children wish him at the devil. So Menedemus curs'd with stores of wealth, A torment to his neighbours and himself; Tho' twelve revolving moons his farms amount To sums, arithmetic can scarcely count; The sordid miser starves, throughout the year, On mouldy scraps of victuals and small beer; Performs all servile offices of life, And thanks the doctor that he has no wife; Nor o'er the brute can nature's ties prevail, He sees his children perish in a jail. From such examples theorists advance, That jarring atoms made the world by chance; Else could impartial providence impart So large a treasure to so mean a heart? Mistaken tenets.â Such a conduct shows, That riches misapply'd are real woes. Ask you why Simo to his son behaves, Like Christian tyrants to their Negro slaves? And scarcely will allow a competence Sufficient to indulge one single sense? It is not cruelty, but avarice, Which comprehends the dregs of every vice. Else would Clorinda, nature's darling pride, Whose gayest flights have virtue for their guide, Whom all mankind with glowing ardour crave, And deem it ment to be thought her slave. Not taste the rapture of a marriage state, To please a father's avarice, or hate? How hard her station to a generous mind, To soft humanity and love inclin'd? Condemn'd by nature's bounty pain to give, Too sure to wound, unable to relieve. Tho' such old Simo's penury of soul, Where no ideas but of lucre roll; Frugal at home, at other folks expence, His taste rich wines, and gay magnificence. If any friend invite him to a feast, The master thinks he's happy in his guest: Good-natur'd, affable, and high in spirits, He rails at all those vices he inherits; He smiles with joy to see the sparkling bowl, And with large draughts revives his thirsty soul; While the wine flows, his heart with rapture burns, But, when the banquet's o'er, his spleen returns; Then plagues at home his family and wife, And makes them curse the time he gave them life. As from one virtue many blessings flow, From one mad vice variety of woe: Thus upstart gamesters by their betters thrive, And ride in coaches they were glad to drive; While noble heirs, to large revenues born, Serve splendid wretches who were once their scorn, And forfeit, by the folly of a night, Their starving sons hereditary right. But spare, cries one, your censure on the times, Nor like a Stoic call our pleasures crimes: You quite mistake,â for, rightly understood, I grant that pleasure is our greatest good; That not our real wants, but vanities, Are the true source from whence our sorrows rise: None would be wretched, were they but content To strive to be no more than nature meant: Each has his proper sphere of life assign'd, Peculiar to the texture of his mind. Thus honest Dromo born to live with care, And heap up riches for a spendthrift heir, Pursues the rugged path his stars ordain, His table frugal, and his garment plain: Him every worthy citizen esteems, Because he is the very man he seems: But mad with riches, if he leave his trade, And think to shine at court, or masquerade; That instant he becomes the ridicule Of every well-dress'd fashionable fool. So Bardus, were he not bewitch'd with pow'r, Might drink rich wines at home, and keep his whore; In life's low vale from state affairs exempt, Perhaps in solitude might shun contempt; But, by his brother into business hurl'd To blunder round the habitable world, The public scorn of Europe is become, Abroad deluded, and despis'd at home. What but the thirst of universal fame, Aspiring Titus, can e'en critics blame? Bless'd with a genius, and with arts adorn'd, For which his proud ambition makes him scorn'd: And yet his merit might deserve applause, Were he content to act by nature's laws: But start a subject:â Mark how he harangues, Why one's transported, when another hangs; Alike on trifles, and important things, On plays, religion, opera's, or kings; Nor will he condescend to hold his tongue On subjects, which he never thought upon; His judgment teaches senates what is fit, To Pult'ney politics, to Stanhope wit; Eager he grasps at fame, but meets with none, Like gamesters by too bold a cast undone. None but the supple cringing parasite, Who takes in fools encomiums a delight; Whose life is govern'd by one slavish rule, To flatter every coxcomb, knave, and fool; Can entertain a hope, or wish, to be From the world's censure, or reproaches free: The wretch, who vainly thinks to make a friend Of all mankind, deserves no better end, Than that deluded mean dependant race, Who starve in expectation of a place. But if this vanity of heart betrays Your mind to catch at universal praise: Think there are men, whose virtues far exceed Thy merit, as immortal Thames the Tweed! That Pope in poetry has suffer'd scandal, In physic Nichols, and in music Handel; While Maurus in his gilded chariot rides, And by a lucky hit at court presides: That Murray, rising genius of the bar, Who shines the foremost in the verbal war, Is undermin'd, in character and fame, By reptiles of the law without a name. Thus envy dwells within ignoble minds, And at another's excellence repines. E'en brave Argyle true to his country's cause, Bold in defence of liberty and laws, Bore the loud thunder of each party's rage, To save from bondage a corrupted age: From such examples we may learn to bear Their praise, or censure, with an equal ear. 'Tis an old maxim, which experience taught, Nothing suits worse with vice than want of thought: This thousand coxcombs prove to their undoing, What's one man's foible, is another's ruin. That Gallus keeps a girl is past dispute, And by the world is held in good repute: Yet wretched Cornus knows it to his cost, For that, his character and fortune lost, With lust and avarice the harlot drains His sinking income, and his ebbing veins: But, to do penance for his former life, He damns the town, and takes her for his wife. Capellus, in the winter of threescore, Sneaks out at midnight to his private whore; Where all things are provided, in a trice, To pamper nature, and sollicit vice: Behind her cully Messalina stands, And shakes the Fasces in her servile hands; Love's long extinguish'd fires revive again, And titillation thrills thro' every vein. When the warm tide of youthful blood prevails, When strong temptation courts, and virtue fails, When wanton beauties set the soul on fire, And kindle in the coldest breast desire; If youth indulge their appetites at large, When vanquish'd reason has resign'd her charge, The world confess it is a venial evil, But an old fumbling dotard is the devil. In vain we boast of reason for our guide, Which cannot stem the passion's stronger tide: But, when the various tempests cease to roll, Reflects keen anguish on the tortur'd soul, Soon as one fop is branded with disgrace, Another fool starts up, and claims a place. See gay Papillus trip along the Park, A pretty, trifling, flutt'ring, woman's spark; In wit a bankrupt, yet in talking loud, Eager to catch the praises of the croud; In fortune indigent, but dawb'd with lace, In hopes to be mistaken for his grace; Scarce sense enough to know himself a fool, And yet pretends mankind to ridicule; Proud of his person, vainer of his parts, He thinks to captivate all ladies hearts: To bosom friends a stranger, if undrest, But, if you shine in an embroider'd vest, An humble servant to the meanest foe, Provided that his enemy's a beau. What, but desire to be a poet thought, Has the world's bleak contempt on Codrus brought? Codrus has many labour'd drama's writ, Tho' neither curs'd with poverty, or wit: Tir'd with his stuff in vain spectators hiss, It is their judgment, not his play's amiss; Nor will he with that poor pretence be shamm'd, But once a year makes interest to be damn'd. Let the wretch scribble on! more flagrant crimes Demand the censure of satiric rhimes; Who whisper calumny, the secret foe, That aggravates each circumstance of woe; Who blacken characters, in truth's disguised With specious tales insinuating lyes; The venom'd malice rankling in the heart Conceal'd in soothing words, the courtier's art; Who spread ill-natur'd scandal o'er the town, Of injur'd characters to them unknown; Who seems your friend on purpose to betray; Or villains that decypher lives away: These are the men deserve keen satire's rage; And Of Counden, in the north of England. Sutton stands the foremost in the page. Prompt me, great Oldham, with thy pointed wit, With curses for the lowest scoundrel fit! Let thy keen genius thro' each sentence shine, Improve my rage, and stab in every line! But not to blast an honest man's good name, Or injur'd merit in distress defame! But make the villain feel, who breaks his word, A poet's pen is sharper than his sword. Let Hudd'sford fear! whose talent is to throw The secret dart on his unguarded foe; Who has for mischief such an appetite, He takes in others ruin a delight; For whose dear sake resentment makes me write. Nor shall the wretch's dark obscurity Preserve him from the brand of infamy; The muse shall stigmatise his tainted name, And drag him forth the mark of public shame; Till like a wounded wretch upon the wheel, By torture forc'd each secret to reveal, Worn out with dilatory misery, He asks the Coup-de-grace, and begs to die: So satire shall this hypocrite pursue, Till he has paid the debt to vengeance due; Then may his ashes mingle with the dead, With all Ashwedn'sday's curses on his head; And let experience teach this abject man, To dare to injure none, because he can. Next shifting Tartuff's glaring vices call For sharp-edg'd satire on this priest of Baal; Tho' censure is in vain, and much I fear To mention but his life is too severe: In former times so warm with party-rage, He was the champion of a patriot age; So very zealous in old England's cause, He thought all kings oppressors of the laws; But now so conscience and the C?agree, He votes against his country's liberty; A m?e is the prostituted price, Which all his future conduct cheaply buys; Secure in pow'r he sits elate with pride, Nor can hypocrisy his vices hide: A smiling Judas, who betrays his trust, Retain'd for life by Lycon's sordid dust. Here would the weary muse her pen resign, But rigid justice claims another line: Is there a meagre-looking brazen fool, Profanely impudent, and pertly dull? A wit profess'd, without one grain of sense, Applause his aim, and physic his pretence; Religion's falshood is his sober theme, When drunk the caitif ventures to blaspheme: Some shallow fops his phrases quaint admire, Who calls our Saviour the country squire: Religion, honour, virtue, are to him Meer notions, or a politician's whim: In coffee-houses vents his paltry wit, And swears who e'er believes in God,âis bit. A sodomite, at least in theory, But unsuccessful in his villainy: The virtuous objects of his passion dead, The wretch presumes once more to show his head; But first enquires, before he would appear, Whether a pillory's erected At Cambridge. here? If such a man exists, sure none can blame The muse that brands him with a villain's name; If not,âthese harmless lines no pain can give, Nor injur'd innocence a wound receive: Tho' he has 'scap'd the pillory,â'tis worse To fall beneath an angry poet's curse; His character e'en satire cannot wrong, Tho' Oldham lent me his invective tongue. To the Author of some Latin Poems published a few Years ago. To speak of merit in impartial lays, And without flattery a friend to praise; For this the muse shall strike the vocal lyre, And sing in numbers which thy works inspire; Who feels your sorrow with a sigh sincere, And spite of resolution drops a tear. Tho' clouded, like the sun, thy genius shines Thro' fortune's mist in bright immortal lines; Like martyrs from affliction stronger grows, Nor drooping sinks beneath a weight of woes. Not so could Ovid in his exile write; The heart-felt anguish check'd his tow'ring flight; His theme no longer was the blooming fair, But sung in dying notes his own despair. When modern sing-song panegyric bards, Whom Cibber praises, and the court rewards, In dark oblivion shall forgotten lie, Except preserv'd by chance beneath a pye; With rapture shall posterity rehearse To their admiring sons thy lasting verse. Since Horace flourish'd in Augustus' court (For men of wit and taste the gay resort) None but the British bards with ease could sing, Or touch with equal skill the Roman string; From their rude hands the lyre dropp'd idly down, Because they were not lineal to the throne. Tho' Stephen's muse in humble metre flows, And warbles numbers near ally'd to prose, Thy genius gives a lustre to his rhimes, And such a bard may live to future times. Had Fortune shone with an auspicious ray, And gilded with her beams thy natal day, The world had lost the labours of thy brain, And PhÅbus had inspir'd thy breast in vain: But now what glory will reward your toil, If, when the Goddess frown, the Muses smile? And sure that proves the most distinguish'd fame, Which rises from your own, not father's name. To the same, on the Ladies Subscription for the English Poems. How shall the muse a grateful tribute bring, Or numbers worthy of their favour sing, Who, touch'd with pity at a friend's distress, Have by their bounty made his sorrow less? Since blooming beauties of the British isle Will condescend to cast on wit a smile, Let petit maitres languish in despair, Nor longer boast the favours of the fair. Now Shakespear's scenes by modern Belle's revive, And teach the charming sex with taste to live; Impartial reason will their actions guide, And make each blushing maid a happy bride. Gay toasts shall learn to slight embroider'd beaux, And chuse a husband for his sense,ânot cloaths. In vain mad poets boast the sacred nine, Implore their aid each sentence to refine; Except the fair their flowing verse approve, And learn from moving strains the art of love. E'en PhÅbus' self might wish his lyre unstrung, Since Daphne would not listen when he sung: Your muse has met a more auspicious fate, To please, tho' sinking under fortune's weight; For sure that book must be secure of fame, Which bears a Portland's and a Dashwood's name. The Nineteenth Ode of the Third Book of Horace, addressed to a Friend. The great exploits of princes you can sing, From Julius CÃ¦sar down to Britain's king; Of gasping heroes welt'ring in their blood, Who nobly perish'd for their country's good; How Churchill tam'd the bold aspiring Gaul, Whose very name made trembling armies fall; Of gallant deeds by sea, by land, perform'd, Of Spanish navies sunk, Gibraltar storm'd. To gain this point, you midnight vigils keep, And search the learned dead, while others sleep; Neglect the sprightly joys of blooming youth To find some dark unprofitable truth. Your noble taste's above such trifling cares, To know what price, this vintage, claret bears; At whose expence to-morrow we shall dine, And bathe, before we drink the sparkling wine; To raise the spirits, and revive the heart, And drive the chilling cold from every part. Leave musty books! exhaust the flowing bowl To some fair virgin, idol of your soul: Fill up!âanother glass to recommend Fair Cowper's health, or some deserving friend: Three bumpers to the graces sacrifice, But for a poet three will scarce suffice! If panting after fame your bosom glows With thoughts aspiring above vulgar prose, In equal numbers drink the sacred nine, Till your rich face shall like your genius shine! The jovial madness pleases,âboys begin To strike with skilful touch the sounding string! Then strow fresh roses at your lord's command: I hate the niggard miser's sparing hand. Let Lycus burst with envy at the noise, And lovely Lyco fit for other joys, Than to lie bury'd in a husband's arms, Whose frozen age doats on her blooming charms; Whatever nymph indulgent nature gave Beauty sufficient to make you her slave, May she this evening bless your ravish'd sight, And make you with like Jove a longer night: In vain the sex superior merit boast, Fair Dashwood triumphs still a reigning toast. Verses writ on a Glass, under the Name of Miss Trotter of Durham. If all the charms of her celestial mind With outward splendor in her features shin'd, Our sex would universal rivals prove, And the world fall a victim to her love. The first Book of Martial, Epigram. 58. Imitated in English. You ask, dear Car, what mistress I would chuse? Not one too strictly coy, nor yet too loose; Whose unaffected character would prove Like Delia modest, yet a friend to love; No prudish air to damp the genial joy, And charms enough to satisfy,ânot cloy. On a Quack's Motto, Exemplo monstrante viam. How often learning, wit, and merit fail, When impudence and ignorance prevail? This Maurus knows, nor feels the world's reproach, But bears the pointed satire on his coach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Satire of Juvenal imitated. Shall every pension'd scribbler draw his pen, And gild with venal praise the worst of men? (E'en Dixon glean the scandal of a year In one dull tripos, to be thought severe?) Shall One of the senior fellows of Trinity-College in Oxford, who published an incomparable poem, called the Golden Farmer, which he writes marginal notes on every full moon. Wilks his Golden Farmer still rehearse, And void of thought roar out his frantic verse? Then by mad fits with margin notes explain The mystic labours of his muddy brain? Shall tragic Macer plague the sacred nine, Nor fear the satire of one Dunciad line? Or barren Codrus strain his bastard wit, To be the jest of galleries and pit? To me scarce any place is better known, Where fops resort, the triflers of the town, Than the large theatre, and vaulted hall, Where emulating hawkers pamphlets bawl. What ladies an Italian's favour boast, (For him the fair sex innocently toast) When the shrill eunuch warbles out his charms, What rapture, Gods! to pant within his arms? His thrilling notes their ravish'd souls employ, Tho' drudging husbands scarce can give them joy. Such themes our youthful poetasters charm, Who fir'd with thirst of fame in numbers swarm, With brazen lungs to bellow out their wit, Till the dome trembles, and the columns split: While wiser bards from Merlin's prophecies To sooth the great extract a thousand lyes; From whose dark record of eight-hundred years, That Caroline should bless this land, appears; Born with a taste each science to refine, To sink a cave, or raise a hermit's shrine. This privilege of verse all authors claim; Who write for bread, or for immortal fame. Such madness I abhorr'd, and rather chose To give good counsel even to my foes; To warn corrupted statesmen of their fate, And bid the knight withdraw before too late; Left See his life, printed in 1734, for A. Dod. Cochran's destiny reward his pains, And if no patent, sure to hang in chains. When such a swarm of scribblers plague this age, Why should the muse restrain her pointed rage? But hold, says one! is there no subject fit, But writing satire to employ your wit? Sir Robert's virtues claim a just applause; I leave Sir Robert to his country's laws. What!â no encomiums on the British fleet, When every year such mighty squadrons meet: How would Iberia tremble to behold Such naval forces, â were it not for gold?â To treat,â not fight,â was their pacific aim; And make a mighty monarch sign The convention. his name. These are the triumphs happy counsels bring, When such wise ministers will serve their king. But thanks to Fleury! whose refining art 'Twixt jarring nations play'd so nice a part; What senates labour'd, he perform'd alone, And cancell'd treaties which we blush to own: Convention-tools their former votes disdain, And claim unbounded empire o'er the main: But by your leave, good Sir, the reason's clear, Why satires flourish each revolving year. When eunuchs by the ladies favour thrive, And in the sun-shine of a palace live; When fops protest, and younger brothers swear, The spawn of Rome are stallions to the fair; When tender virgins mount the fleeting horse, And urge with full career the rapid course; Fir'd with a thirst of glory never rest, Till the beast's spoils adorn their manly breast: When upstart politicians, venal knaves, Basely conspire to make their betters slaves; When vulgar wretches, by dependance great, Commence the necessary tools of state; Tho' born to labour, delicately nice, To live like modern Conoisseurs in vice; What honest spirit can his spleen contain, Nor dare to lash the vices of this reign? Matho, the curse of chairmen for his weight, To every court of justice rides in state, With all his useful implements of law; Saints that can swear to what they never saw: Vile minions!â who with ease their fortunes earn, And candidates without a vote return; Assisted by these arts, great Matho's cause Eludes stern justice, and defies the laws; While forfeited estates his zeal reward, Tho' patriots scarce can move without a guard: To him all lesser villains bow their heads, E'en Sk?r without bribes his presence dreads; To country principles a friend profess'd, But now like G?h thinks honour but a jest; Without one sigh each virtue can resign, And prove in ministers a right divine; Curs'd by his stars to bear the public scorn, By nature form'd a slave, a villain born: E'en female wits in state intrigues too wise Are banish'd, lest their tongue betray their eyes, Tho' libertines, by being dupes to lust, Supplant you, as more worthy of the trust; With brawny vigour act the stallion's part: Such gallantry may gain the widow's heart. Insatiate Messalina's death will prove Him richest, who has best indulg'd her love. Poor Limberham expects in vain to share One half, whose limbs such labour could not bear; And sure lord Vainlove can have no pretence To please a blooming widow's craving sense. But let such miscreants earn their gilded dust, By being slaves to courts, or women's lust; Till rioting in vice has made them pale, As batter'd harlots, when their colours fail; As trembling orators that plead for life, Or gallants taken with a neighbour's wife. What other evils shall the muse relate? Of guardians, by their orphans ruin great; Of senators that only can complain, (For W?'s numbers make impeachments vain;) Those arts, by which he rose, maintain his pow'r, A standing army and a royal dow'r; His crimes confirm the greatness of his soul, Above nice conscience, and the laws controul; He smiles to think how frantic patriots rage, And blesses the corruption of the age. But nobler sentiments inspir'd his youth, Who boldly spoke in the defence of truth; Who stood the vengeance of perverted laws, Who suffer'd chains in freedom's glorious cause, And with a sigh lamented Fleury's fate, Because his country's thraldom made him great: But statesmen's principles will strangely veer, In the short course of one revolving year: The public spirit of an honest heart Degenerate, to act a villain's part; The voice of liberty in senates loud Now rails at patriots,â a licentious croud, And the free sentiments which charm'd before, Can flatter kings in arbitrary pow'r. But now this flaming meteor of the skies Has spent his blaze, and in oblivion dies, Whose conduct had estrang'd the people's love. Their ardent zeal the willing nation prove Against rebellion to defend the crown, And with their loyal persons guard the throne. Since vice is sacred held among the great, And virtue spurn'd by ministers of state; Since men, with delegated power drunk, Without a blush in triumph wed a punk; Whose shining virtues should deserve command, Set bad examples to a tainted land: While gaping crouds with dazzled eyes adore The gems that sparkle on a foreign whore: Shall such dark vices seek the gloom of night, Nor satire dare to drag them forth to light? But the nice manners of the present age Abhor the name of villain on the stage; When a feign'd traytor's tainted blood is spilt, The real statesman shudders at the guilt. Gustavus A play that was prohibited, because it contained some lines in praise of liberty, which offended the minister., pleading in his country's cause For liberty, the first of nature's laws, Offends the wise reformers of the times, Whose stern decree makes public virtues â crimes. Let other poets haunt the purling stream, And spin out verses softer than their theme: Such trifling subjects would defile my page, Whose pointed lines should glow with manly rage. When husbands, that have blooming beauties, snore, To give their loving consorts leave to whore; When noble heirs esteem it no disgrace To spend their fortunes, and then beg a place; Thro' gaping crouds in gilded cars to ride, While harlots blaze in jewels by their side, And as their wills direct, the coursers guide. When forging lawyers injur'd heirs beguile, Grow rich, and fatten on the perjur'd spoil; Affect to dress like fops with foreign air, With vests embroider'd, and their bosoms bare; Such flagrant follies would make Welsted write In Pope's, Minerva's, and the Muses spite. But these are trifles, when to some compar'd, Who trade in blood, and murder for reward: Such dark artificers are skill'd in death, To stab, or poison your untainted breath. If wanton wives their wicked aid implore, Or spendthrift sons wish fathers were no more, Gold signs their passage to the Stygian shore. If you resolve some vast estate to raise, Leave starving honesty to barren praise! Act some unheard of sin, that hell may own Its master foil'd, and all his crimes undone, The splendid equipage, and stately dome, Magnificence, that rivals ancient Rome, Are no more signs of merit, than a place, Stars, garters, titles, emblems of disgrace. Tho' lands are mortgag'd, yet their crimes afford, To spread rich banquets on the costly board. When virgin brides their lawful husbands flight, And make them cuckolds on the wedding-night; When beardless youths adulteries commit, Rapes, riots, massacres, to show their wit: Fir'd with just wrath, his pen each poet draws, And writes without a muse in virtue's cause. From the first period of revolving time, When blooming nature flourish'd in her prime, The various passions, which to man belong, Their hopes, and fears, are subjects of my song. When were such glaring vices ever known To spread contagion over all the town? How many, born to riches that suffice For more than all the luxury of vice, Their whole estate upon a card advance, The fools of fortune, and the slaves of chance? Whose hopes, like visionary chymists, fail, That waking find their golden dream a jail. When did such tow'ring fabrics ever rise, Or such rich banquets feast our fathers eyes? Yet, starving clients from the Forum haste, And find a shotten herring their repast; But first their patrons, in a surly tone, Ask the mean tools what party-service done? Then with fair promises their cause promote; And livings in reversion for a vote! While slaves and nobles croud their levees door, And with a servile voice some boon implore; Pimps, peers, and courtiers eagerly contend, Whose darkest deeds shall gain the greatest friend. Here a proud upstart with his lordship vies, And spite of merit carries off the prize; Tho' rich in virtue, if your fortune's less, 'Tis reckon'd arrogance to wish success. Gold is at court, the standard of all merit, Makes ideots wise, and cowards men of spirit: Then, Plutus, let us sacrifice to thee: E'en atheists will adore thy deity. Now sordid patrons yearly reckon o'er, How much extortion has increas'd their store; While needy clients mourn their wretched state, Whose plunder'd fortunes make oppressors great. When the bright sun first gilds the purple dawn, And fair Aurora ushers in the morn, Dependant wretches on proud Sylla wait, And cringe obsequious at his palace-gate; In servile crouds before his chariot run, And strive, like fools, who first shall be undone; Buoy'd up with promises of friends profess'd, To starve in expectation of a feast. While ransack'd elements their stores reveal, To make a glutton happy for a meal: Whose lands are forfeited to gorge his maw, Tho' sure to groan beneath the griping law. E'en hungry citizens would blush to eat, With such devouring rage, at sheriffs treat. The banquet o'er, each bloated guest complains Of sudden qualms, short breath, and racking pains: Nature wants strength to circulate the blood, Oppress'd with loads of indigested food. Scarce have the wretches time to make a will, So swift is foul intemperance to kill, Beyond Ward's drop, or epidemic pill; Whose disappointed parasites lament Their sudden death without a testament. Posterity will curse these hated times, And damn themselves in vain to match our crimes; Each vice has reach'd its greatest altitude, Spent all its rage, and deviates into good. But where's a genius, whose satiric quill Can make such harden'd wretches blush at ill? Where is that ancient liberty of wit, When every fool, and knave, by name was hit? Then servile H?l?ms might know his abject state, Who feels the world's bleak scorn without their hate; Polite to please, to flatter, to deceive, Wily as Satan when he tempted Eve; In whose dark mind his double actions blend The secret villain with the public friend; The mean servility, and humble pride, Which men of spirit with contempt deride. Curs'd with five senses to endure his pain, With industry, to seek relief in vain; With parts and learning, which the world respect; With honesty, that all mankind suspect; With tyranny, which makes himself a slave, Weary of life, yet shudders at the grave; With principles,âby which some fools are shamm'd, And just enough religion,âto be damn'd. Let others fulsome panegyrics write, While I set villains in a proper light; Or else describe a fop in smoother stile, Correct my muse, and make e'en satire smile. St. James's modish petit maitres own Philemon is the darling of the town: A mighty pretty book Philemon wrote, Without one glimmering of sense or thought: Exact in judging, as the fair agree, Of fans, and silks, perfumes, or Hyson tea; Endow'd by nature with a trifling mind, Prone to spread scandal like the female kind: But fops, like him, that propagate abuse, Are scarcely worth the censure of the muse; Then let the coxcomb unmolested pass, To that fool's paradise, a looking-glass. When, arm'd for virtue, manly Pope will write, What swarm of fools precipitate their flight? Each secret villain, struck with conscious awe, Dreads more his censure than the penal law; E'en harden'd Peter blushes at his satire, And wishes honesty was in his nature: Gay modern atheists kiss the poet's rod, Reform their lives, and tremble at a God. Tho' Walpole's virtues claim applause from peers, From courtiers, senates, bishops, gazetteers; The muse secure may point each venom'd line, With Empson, Dudley, or a Cataline; Brand their foul names to each succeeding age, And make the living dread the future page. On the Widow Scarf, Goddess of the Three-Tuns at Cambridge. Shall Bradgate's name adorn the poet's verse, And not one muse Lenora's praise rehearse? Whose melting looks resistless force impart, To charm the fight, and captivate the heart; Whom nature form'd so virtuous, and so fair, As kindles love, and yet creates despair; Tho' warm as wanton Venus, when she strove On Ida's mount to win the prize of love. Forbear, rash youth, to trust your wand'ring eyes, Conceal'd in beauty's smiles perdition lies: Thus mortals gaze upon the lightning's blast, Tho' sure to perish in the flame at last. Fair Queen of Delos, tender thoughts inspire, Which melt the yielding soul to soft desire! Let all the Graces hover on the wing, And aid my fancy, while her charms I sing! Who borrows blushes from Aurora's dawn, And breathes more fragrant than the rosy morn; Like the first scene of opening paradise, E're nature's beauty was deform'd by vice: Whose converse e'en philosophers approve, And rigid Stoics languish into love: The wither'd sages, and the blooming young Attentive listen to the syren's song, Who knows with skill the mortal part to hit, And make each coxcomb wonder at her wit. Tho' courted, humble; tho' admir'd, not vain; The boasted pride of Granta's female train: But, cease my muse, nor in too languid lays Detract from merit, which you mean to praise. A Familiar Epistle to Doctor Reeve,in London. From gallant scenes at park and play, From beaux and belles, for ever gay; From Covent-Garden rakes and wits, From crouds of money-loving cits, And near relations understood As dearest friends by ties of blood; Banish'd by Fortune, I retire (Nor court her smiles, nor dread her ire) To solemn scenes, which hermits chuse, To solitude, the friend of muse; Who never, like a tinsel crony, Forsakes you for the want of money; But, thro' the various scenes of life, Waits on you like a faithful wife, To sportive schemes of mirth and glee, Or mourns your fate at Tyburn tree. No fools I envy their estate, No titled villain's being great; But find that calm content can dwell Within an humble, rural cell. While you, by inclination hurl'd, (Excuse the phrase, that rhimes to world) Attend the busy hum of men, And live by learned dash of pen; Wait on the miser for his wealth, And give him in exchange his health. But why such study, care, and strife, To play this idle farce of life? Since death so soon the scene must close; That period to all human woes. Could fleeting youth for ever stay, And pleasure crown each smiling day; Could neither want, nor pale disease (But then indeed you'd lose your fees) Cast o'er the mind a dismal gloom, And make us rashly wish a tomb: Or was there any certain ground, Where happiness is to be found? The search, methinks, were not amiss, To live in settled state of bliss. But, since all sublunary joys Prove vain, as giddy children's toys, No longer let us blame our stars, Nor wage with Heaven impious wars: Nor like fond fools ourselves deceive, And want the means, or pow'r to live; Since Pope has sung in living lays, T'enjoy; proclaims our Maker's praise. Then revel o'er the present hour; (The only bliss within our pow'r) Be thankful for the pleasure past, And neither wish, nor fear the last: Still bless'd, tho' fortune prove unkind, If all is right within the mind. These simple rhimes I did indite, While I, like miserable Wight, Was riding on a jaded horse, On whom the spur had lost its force: So mounted Pegasus a-stride, (The poet's phantom of a guide) And left a melancholy fit Should in my pericranium sit; To pass away the tedious time, This letter jingled into rhime. But here the muse shall end her work, For now (thank God) I'm come to York. PS. Pray give my services, by dozens, To all my uncles, aunts, and cozens; Remember me to my dear sister, Your wife, I mean, since you have kiss'd her: On Monday morning, every vassal Cries whip and spur for Skelton-Castle, Where bounty, wit, and mirth appear, And pleasure crowns each smiling year. York, March 16, 1740â1. The Second Epistle of the First Book of Horace imitated. First published in 1741â2. While you, dear Paulus, sacrifice your rest, To plead in noisy courts for worth distress'd; Or, bold in senates for the public cause, Revive our injur'd country's dying laws; Watch o'er the growth of pow'r with zealous eye, And unexcis'd preserve our liberty: From all the vanities of life retir'd To Cam's fair banks, where Spenser lay inspir'd, I read with rapture Homer's sacred page, Whose strong description glows with martial rage. Whose nervous lines, with wisdom fraught, impart Those virtues, which adorn or mend the heart; With greater force the moral rules explain, Than Whitfield's cant, or Author of the panegyric on the Queen. Clarke's pathetic strain. But, left you think this doctrine too severe, My reasons, Paulus, if at leisure, hear. Fair Helen's charms, that kindled fierce desire In Paris' breast, and set the world on fire, For ever bloom in his immortal strains, Whose fable with such energy contains The zeal of foolish monarchs mad with pride, The mob's wild tumult, like a rapid tide. Antenor his dear country's fate deplor'd, And said the fatal fair should be restor'd; But peevish Paris, obstinately wrong, Detain'd the blooming theme of Homer's song. The sage of Pylos eloquently show'd, What dire effects from civil discord flow'd. From love's soft passion equal evil springs, To the rash violence of lawless kings. All the foul vices of an earthly God Prove to the meanest slave an iron rod. Sedition, dark deceit, and burning lust, Corruption, violence, and breach of trust, On courtier, citizen, and templar seize, And spread o'er all the land the rank disease. Again Ulysses' bright example tells, What good in wisdom, and in virtue dwells; Who left Troy's smoaking ruins to explore The men and manners of a distant shore; Rough toil encounter'd with a steady soul, Which pleasure could not melt, nor fear controul. You know the fable of the syren's strain, And Circe's feast, that charm'd the thoughtless train; But, had her soothing arts allur'd his soul To taste the banquet, or partake the bowl, The sage had dwindled to as low a thing, As G?h in senates, or some modern king. But we seem mortals of another race, The sons of luxury, contempt, disgrace; Soft as PhÅacian This passage shows the antiquity of coxcombs, which makes me wonder they are not held in more veneration by the curious. fops, who turn'd their care To mend a feature, or adjust a hair: Mere pimps, and revellers of Comus' court, Where beaux' in muffs, fools, parasites resort; All the lewd tribe of prodigals undone, Who, steep'd in vice, sleep down a summer's fun, And by soft music, languishingly slow, Detain the drowsy God from realms below. Shall dark assassins, for a golden prize, Amidst the sable gloom of night arise? And will no danger break your calm repose, No friend's misfortune, or your country's woes? Nor e'en that high regard, which patriots feel For Vernon's safety, and the public weal! When no malignant fever fires the brain, And health luxuriant revels in each vein, Tho' sunk in sloth, from all diseases free, In dropsies, you will run to Reeve or Lee. Soon as Aurora dawns, some book peruse, That treats of subjects pleasing, yet of use! To charm each wand'ring thought from envy's rage, Or love, that tyrant o'er our blooming age. Whate'er offends the sight we shun with haste, And shall the mind's disease for ever last? Dare to begin, and half your work is done: Plain reason tells us what to seek, or shun. Whoe'er delays to live by reason's rule, Waits on the river's bank, like nature's fool; With visionary hope, like courtiers fed, He thought the stream would leave its ouzy bed; But still the sacred spring for ever glides Thro' flow'ry meadows, with revolving tides. Wealth, beauty, children, are the joys of life, That make each mortal happy in a wife: Patient of cold we tame the stubborn plain, And pant beneath the noon-tide heat for gain. Why should we wish for more? If fortune grants That competence, which modest nature wants: Except that Godlike pleasure to bestow On friends who sink beneath a weight of woe. Not all the splendor, which the world admire, The pride of life, each object of desire, From burning fevers can preserve their lord, Or to the wounded spirit ease afford. Still W?e's conscience throbs beneath a star, And shakes his fabric with intestine war; Our country's wrongs sit heavy on his breast, And, like Macbeth, his guilt has murder'd rest; Exalted on the top of fortune's wheel, He wants that peace, which men of virtue feel. Wealth is but vain, if gout, or stone annoy; 'Tis health alone that gives us to enjoy. Who live dependant slaves to hope or fear, To them life's greatest blessings will appear As Kneller's pictures to a German race, Or Ward's specific in a gouty case! To such Belinda's melody of voice, With Handel's music, seems a grating noise. In vain philosophers their rules define, Except their pupils breathe a soul divine. Youth's fleeting pleasures leave a sting behind; And want eternal racks the miser's mind. With bold rebuke each wild desire restrain, Nor let another's bliss create your pain. No tyrant can a greater plague invent, Than restless envy, foe to calm content. Who lets each sudden gust of passion rise, And, like a tempest, mingles earth and skies; Thro' various scenes, some rash exploit will mourn, And trace repentant sorrow to his urn. Rage is a short-liv'd madness, that requires The firmest curb to check its warm desires; So strong an impulse can no medium have, But reigns a tyrant, or becomes a slave. Who knows with skill the fiery steed to rule, While young, will train his spirit in the school; And tender hounds their infant voices try, Before they join the chorus of the cry. Now, in the bloom of your untainted youth, Imbibe the precepts of unerring truth! Such early principles will ever last, Like season'd vessels that preserve the taste Of their first tincture; but if you remain Supinely slothful, and the prize disdain, Or rush impetuous o'er the dusty plain; I will not emulate the glorious strife, But save my distance in the course of life. Verses addressed to a Gentleman, who commended the Durham Ladies. In vain you talk of Mowbray's mien, Who moves in Dance the Cyprian queen; Of Dunning's charms, with pow'r to move The frozen heart of age to love; Of Williamson's enchanting air, Majestic form, divinely fair! Whose beauty sets the world on fire, And virtue makes the flame expire, Yet her sweet converse strikes you more, Than all those charms mankind adore; Of Fanny Since married to Walter Hawksworth, Esq; in 1745. Hall, her sex's pride, By merit made a blooming bride; (So fond a sympathy of hearts Their mutual happiness imparts; Each man of taste her form approves, And spite of resolution loves; Those dimpled smiles and piercing eyes Make half the gallant world her prize: With sense of that peculiar cast, Which merit will for ever last, When all her beauties in their prime Shall wither in the arms of time.) Or Lascelles, in the bloom of youth, Adorn'd with innocence and truth, Whose carriage flows with so much ease, In her 'tis natural to please; And sprightly Trotter debonnair, With all the graces of the fair; Who raises in your breast alarms, Without the help of beauty's charms, With virtues, which you seldom find To flourish in a female mind. âBowes, Wharton, Rutter, claim your song, â(Their praise would make my verse too long) âAnd many a nymph on Durham plain, âWho captivates her dying swain.â Here Venus blushing, in a rage, Condemn'd to flames my partial page: âTo beauty dedicate your lays, âYet Wilkinson escape your praise! âPoets should have a better taste, âOr else their works will never last.â I own'd the censure too severe, Let drop a penitential tear, Which moves the Goddess to forgive My crime, and let my verses live. But, what are all their boasted charms, Except you revel in their arms? No more than colours to the blind, Or lovers sighing to the wind: Or lovely Bacon's manly sense, If silent,âwith such eloquence; Whose modesty conceals her worth, Like treasure hid beneath the earth. âBut honour checks each loose desire, âAnd reason cools the raging fire; âFor none but villains can approve âThe joys, that ruin her they love.â Yet nature claims her tribute due To the frail part of me and you: 'Tis not to gaze upon the fair Makes their creation worth our care; If travellers with drought are curst, Will painted rivers quench their thirst? Then come, my Delia, to my bed, In spite of all the world has said! Let disappointed coxcombs boast Of favours granted by my toast! While modest nymphs devoutly rail, To show their nature is not frail; And vent their scandal over tea: That must be truth, where all agree; No bribe can force a female tongue Another's injur'd fame to wrong; For sympathy unites their hearts, And makes them take each other's parts. Then let the world condemn, or praise, Your conduct, or my trivial lays! In joys extatic we will drown, And scorn the censure of the town: For lyes, like mushrooms sprung from earth, Not long survive their spurious birth; While fools and knaves repine with shame, To find their malice miss its aim. An Epistle to Lucinda. If the soft language of a bleeding heart Can verses worthy of your ear impart; Describe my passion with an ardent zeal, And paint in lively colours what I feel; These tender lines could never fail to move Your soul to melt with sympathetic love. How vain that hope! What numbers can prevail? E'en Jove, without a golden show'r, would fail: Except some guardian God your mind directs To rise above the trifles of your sex, And, like Ithuriel's spear, with touch refine The sordid passion from the flame divine. When dawning nature, in your infant state, Unveil'd those charms which on your person wait, My bosom kindled with a secret flame, And my heart panted, when I heard your name: Still with increasing years my passion grew, And glow'd with rapture at the sight of you. The lavish praise of beauty you disdain, That fading glory of the female train: Let the vain creatures triumph in their charms, Who never please, but in their lovers arms; No other shining qualities can boast, But just that white and red which makes a toast. Such fond pursuits, your early reason taught, Were splendid toys, unworthy of a thought: Ambition made you act a nobler part, To polish nature, and correct the heart; To cultivate each virtue of the mind, And prove the pattern of the female kind. Oft have I wander'd in the gloomy shade, Bless'd with thy lively converse,âcharming maid: When my soul languish'd to reveal my love, (How vain my boasted resolutions prove!) Too soon the trembling accents dy'd away, Nor would my fault'ring tongue my heart obey. What various passions in my bosom roll? Fear, hope, despair, by turns invade my soul: My sanguine wishes flatter each desire, And little Cupids fan the raging fire. But soon another scene my fancy draws Of noble youths, whose fortune pleads their cause: The splendid equipage, the pomp of state, And all the dazzling glories of the great, Are objects which sollicit every sense: And female virtue is a weak defence. What can Lucinda in my person see, To slight the fashionable world for me, Whose only merit is to love the fair, Whose virtues make me languish in despair? If all my fond suspicions idle prove, And your breast kindle with a mutual love; The study of my life shall be to please The charming fair, who gave me wealth and ease: Who scorn'd the servile praise of all mankind, For him, who deems the virtues of the mind Above the splendid gifts which fortune gave, Or beauty, to confirm the world your slave. But if some happy rival's planet shine, Auspicious to your wish, with rays divine; Conceal this fatal secret in your breast, And with each other live, for ever blest! Still in your friendship let me bear a part, And give me your esteem without your heart. An Answer to some bad Rhimes on Delia, wrote by a Parson, who charitably endeavoured to persuade her, that she would certainly be damned. What gloomy priest, or melancholy maid, Of their own guilty consciences afraid, Presumes to persecute a blooming fair, And make in doggrel verse her soul despair? With superstitious fears let fools be shamm'd; Without a hell, such poets must be damn'd. Why was the great Creator's art display'd To form, like thee, some fair enchanting maid; Except it wisely was ordain'd above, To make his creatures happy in their love? Then let the bigot rail, and prude accuse; Yet envy the rank pleasure of the stews: Starve o'er the feast, which nature kindly gave, And live to their fierce appetites a slave! What! is this boasted honour of your sex, To curse yourselves, and all mankind to vex? How many nymphs their happiness have sold, To live with men they scorn, for sorbid gold? And been most wretched prostitutes for life, Tho' gilded with the specious name of wife? Delia, to thee, these candid lines are sent, To spurn the fool, that can such malice vent. Let him rail on, and triumph in his spleen! His folly, not thy want of worth, is seen. Without the common place of wit, or sense, Numbers, or rhime, a poet to commence, Is e'en below the world's contempt to sink: Then let him damn himself with pen and ink. An Epistle to a young Lady. How shall the muse exert the poet's art, To speak each strong emotion of the heart; Each tender sentiment thy looks inspire, When nature languishes to soft desire; When all the faculties to Venus yield, And Pallas quits the long disputed field? 'Tis not the lustre of a sparkling eye, Or rosy cheek, that prompts the frequent sigh; Each feature glowing in the bloom of youth, That captivates like innocence and truth: But when a pleasing form, like yours, we find United to the virtues of the mind; From such prevailing charms to guard the will Exceeds the weaker pow'r of human skill. How hard is the condition of your fate, For loving form'd, yet taught mankind to hate? If the soft passion in your bosom burns, Stern honour will admit no kind returns; But like a rigid parent's hand denies Each seeming good, from which your pleasures rise. Why should that tyrant custom so prevail, As to indulge our sex in being frail? Yet, if weak woman chance to go astray, In paths of bliss, where nature leads the way; Eternal infamy shall blot her name, From the bright register of female fame. When my soul pants with rapture to enjoy Those pleasures, which in you would never cloy; Had I the language of persuasive love, With sympathetic force, your heart to move: Such ill presaging thoughts of future harms Would curse me, while I revell'd in your arms; Lest any pregnant sign of guilt appear, To cloud each feature with a falling tear; To cast a veil of sorrow o'er your eyes, And make your bosom heave with plaintive sighs. How could I bear to see a lovely maid To the world's bleak contempt by me betray'd, Where female malice points the hand of scorn, To brand with infamy the fair forlorn? Such thoughts as these in easy numbers roll, When your dear image charms my ravish'd soul: Each sanguine hope, and every tender fear, As in my faithful heart, is painted here. What calm philosophy can teach the mind In such a doubtful state to be resign'd? To bear the rapture of a burning kiss, Yet shudder at the thought of greater bliss; To gaze with transport on the blooming fair, Yet languish for her sake in cold despair? If such a conduct merit some regard, Let your kind wishes be my just reward! The Author's Prayer. Eternal God! whose being all adore, Tho' none can trace thy self-existent pow'r; Whose eye can pierce the secrets of the heart, When specious villains act a patriot's part; Teach me to know the bounds of right and wrong, And make my life flow smoother than my song! let sacred honour be my lasting guide, And moral virtue o'er each act preside! Nor strictly rigid, nor profanely loose, Indulge the joys of youth without abuse! Nor meanly think, that nature's bounteous Lord Spread the rich feast of life, yet gave the word, That none presume to taste the cup of joy, Left the Creator should his works destroy. Firm to this rule, that not one pleasure flow To feast my ravish'd sense from others woe. Tho' such a private station can create But little good or evil to the state; Yet let each sentiment and action prove My friendship to mankind, and country's love. Riches I seek not, but a tranquil mind, In every character of life resign'd: Without one pain to interrupt my ease, And make my being languish in disease. Such is the tribute of a heart sincere, Whose adoration flows from love, not I have no notion of any adoration being acceptable to the Deity, that proceeds meerly from the fear of punishment; and think gratitude a much more reasonable motive for divine worship. fear. Praise, honour, glory, be to God on high! For all the happiness mankind enjoy. On the Rebellion in the Year 1746. What fond deluding hopes our foes beguile To dream in cells of conquest o'er this isle; Because her sons unite in freedom's cause, And watch, like guardians, o'er their country's laws; In earnest zeal with ministers debate, In senates, to preserve our happy state; To fix the pow'r of kings in proper bounds, Left arbitrary rule the realm confounds: Such are the tenets of each British soul, Whose arms the tyrants of the world controul. Let Fontenoy declare! whose troops beheld Our army reap the glory of the field, When all the slaves of France united fought, How dear that conquest with their blood was bought: There more renown in war did England gain, Than all the trophies of a French campaign. Let Gallia practise her delusive arts, With specious wiles to win the people's hearts! And send a vain pretender to the crown, To rouze the spirit of each free-born son, Whose force shall shake her tyrant on his throne: Revenge this insult on the nation's sense, Who love their country, liberty, and prince, More than they fear the pow'rs of France and Spain, Combin'd against the masters of the main. See Britain's youth The royal hunters., unus'd to war's alarms, Forsake their downy rest, and beauty's charms; All the soft sweets of luxury decline, With firm united hearts in battle join; And, under Oglethorpe's auspicious care, Endure the toils of a rough winter's war; Whose great example will their bosom fire To conquer, or in freedom's cause expire. Such actions claim from princes no regard, Who think their country's thanks a just reward. How vain each effort of an honest mind, To purchase fame by glorious deeds inclin'd? If Sterling merit is the sole pretence, That noble plea will prove a weak defence Against the foul reproach of calumny, Or gilded tale of specious flattery, Which with a smooth insinuating tongue, That character it fears, can meanly wrong: But merit, like the sun eclips'd, will shine With double splendor, as the shades decline. How swift the rebels ravage o'er the land, To fly from Cumberland's avenging hand? To dark rebellion's native seat repair, There brood o'er treason in that tainted air, Curse their vain hopes, and perish in despair? Then let these rash invaders learn from hence, (Who rise in arms against the nation's sense) To conquer George in vain their armies move, Whose throne is guarded by the people's love. A Familiar Epistle to my Friend Ben Loveling. Just on the confines of the land, Where the sea roars against the strand, In a romantic lonely seat, From knaves and fools a safe retreat, From envy, malice, hatred, strife, And all the busy cares of life; My days glide on in tranquil ease, Where solitude has charms to please: Tho' none, with more intense delight, Enjoy the revels of the night, When social mirth and wine conspire To propagate each gay desire: Wine,âwhich can latent wit explore, And set the table in a roar: For some will never show they think, Except when over seas in drink. Yet contemplation has her time To meditate on things sublime; To view, with a discerning eye, The wonders of this earth and sky; And, after the most strict survey, With grateful hearts due homage pay, For that existence we derive From him, who gave us pow'r to live: Or else with searching thoughts to scan The principles that govern man; Each secret of the soul to trace, And every prejudice eraze, Which spite of reason, still we see, Infects us all in some degree. Sometimes, with retrospective view, Lament the friends, which once we knew: Their various talents call to mind, Their features, humour, taste refin'd; Snatch'd in a moment from our sight, Like The Baron. Hilton, to the realms of night. Here let me sprinkle on thy hearse, Immortal shade, one plaintive verse! Let the sad truth in numbers flow, No bliss is perfect here below! For, now thy social spirit's fled, Each jocund swain, and tender maid, With unfeigh'd tears thy fate deplore, And the world sighs,âthou art no more. Here free from luxury and state, Those splendid evils of the great, I lead an independent life, Where Delia serves instead of wife, Who like a faithful friend behaves, With care my little fortune saves; And is, in short, altho' a woman, In worth inferior to no man: A miracle, so rarely seen, Will stagger the belief of men; And must incur the ridicule Of each insipid sneering fool, Who takes it as a thing on trust, No man is honest, woman just. My purse 'tis far enough above To aim at matrimonial love; Without estate to make pretences, You might as well want all the senses As wealth. What merit will obtain A flatter'd idol, weak, and vain? For women now, like lands, are sold To the best purchaser for gold; Who worse than prostitutes expose Their persons to their greatest foes; Without excuse of poverty, To wretchedness and infamy. But not to dwell upon a thing, No more concerns you than the king; To carry on this chat in rhime, I'll tell you how I spend my time. But tremble not!âno long description, Which in these cases often hips one. When first Aurora gilds the skies, I never hold it good to rise; But slumber on till nature loaths Another nap of soft repose; Then either read, or walk, or write, Till darkness ushers in the night; Or on the ocean's bank reclin'd, When Ãolus recalls the wind; No longer stormy Neptune raves, But sun-beams dance upon the waves, Whose lustre gilds the whiten'd sails Of ships, that wait for fresher gales: In such a calm delightful scene, What placid thoughts arise within? Which such an equal tenour keep, Smooth as the surface of the deep; The rudest passions grow refin'd, And all is harmony of mind: Ambition's wild pursuits appear Like children's bubbles blown in air; My soul the pomp of life disowns, And pities kings upon their thrones. Notâthat these sentiments are meant To make you think me quite content; Like vulgar souls without a wish To aim at any greater bliss; But easy in the present state Of things, allotted me by fate. No politics disturb my rest, No party-zeal now fires my breast: Tho' once in opposition strong, Because I though the measures wrong, And had a strange mistaken notion, That patriots had a warm devotion To labour for the public good, To serve their country with their blood; To save the nation from disgrace, Without the prospect of a place. But, since I find such noble schemes Are nothing but romantic dreams, It is not worth a single thought, By whom our country's sold, or bought. Before I finish this relation About my present situation, Perhaps it may not be amiss To tell you of my greatest bliss. Not far from hence, there live two swains, The glory of the Cleaveland plains, In whom good qualities abound, And every social virtue's found. Yet the appearance of a rake Makes rigid fools their worth mistake; Their characters, tho' really good, By numbers are misunderstood: Because devoid of superstition, Which zealous bigots call religion. With men of worth and sense, like these, To join in converse, when you please, And in their friendship have a place, You'll own a very happy case: Their names,âno matter what you call, The world will think of More and Hall. But soon the winter's hollow blast Will make this scene too bleak to last; And then to York I shall repair, But look in vain for Kingsland there. For now,â so cruel fate ordains, Their presence grace the southern plains: Whose sprightly converse had the pow'r To charm away the ling'ring hour; Each social pleasure to refine, And give a relish to the wine. In answer to this rhiming letter, I shall expect from you a better, Except this sudden revolution, This wond'rous turn in constitution, This strange apostasy from wine, Which makes the dullest genius shine, Should damp the vigour of your spirit, And lessen your poetic merit. However write at all events! So with my hearty compliments To Clarke, and all his family, I'm yours, &amp; cÃ¦tera,â T. G. Skinningrave, October 30, 1746. FINIS.</field>
