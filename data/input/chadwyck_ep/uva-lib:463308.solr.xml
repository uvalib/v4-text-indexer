      <field name="fulltext">The Riddles of Heraclitus and Democritus. [Prophesies, predictions] Prophesies, predictions, Stories and fictions, Allegories, rimes, And serious pastimes For all manner men, Without regarde when, Or where they abide, On this or that side, Or vnder the midline Of the Holland sheetes fine, Or in the Tropicks faire Of sunshine and cleere aire, Or vnder the pole Of chimney and seacole: Reade they that list, vnderstand they that can, Verbum satis est to a wise man.The prose riddles have been omitted. 1 [It seemes that Tunis is an auncient towne] It seemes that Tunis is an auncient towne Neere to the ruines of Carthage once so prowde, Whose stately buildings now are cleane pulled downe, And calmde her bruit, that sounded sometime lowde: But roome, that is their auncient far away Doth holde, and shall, though cities all decay. Roome is more large, then spacious Millaine faire, Or Venice or the Tartars great Camball, Bœams three Prages, or Egypts rich Alcaire, Or Quinset in Cataie biggest of them all, And more I say, after the day of doome Hell shall be no where, vnles it be in roome. It importeth that all things are contained in some place: and that hell it selfe must needes be locall. 2 [Roome is a taker, Poets say] Roome is a taker, Poets say, And lawyers are so too, you see Roome is a taker by my fate, No learned man can disagree, And roome shall take, beleeue well me, At least till something, no where be. A variation of the first riddle. So that here is not meant, any thing of the citie Rome. But onely roome or place, viz. the hollow capacitie of one bodie conteining or comprehending another. 3 [Many a man doth speake of mee] Many a man doth speake of mee, But no man euer shall me see, For all in one, doe full agree That no where must my dwelling bee. It may perhaps be vnderstood of the winde: but rightlier I thinke, of that which we call vacuitie or emptinesse. Which is a name, and none essence. For the penetrant subtilitie of aire, suffereth nothing to be emptie, as say the philosophers. 4 [Not Marke, but Mercurie keepes her warme] Not Marke, but Mercurie keepes her warme, And Neptune hugs her in his arme Infertill, fertile of all good things, Her Lord her seruant her children kings. Mercurie is fained to be god of merchandizing, which is the trade that beautifieth the glorious citie of Venice. Neptune inuironeth her, and her Duke is seruile or of very small authoritie. For the maiestie and supreme commandement, is in the senate and magnificoes. 5 [Say what it is and if you can] Say what it is and if you can, That neither was by God create, Nor framed by the hand of man, Nor by the fiend that doth him hate; But caused it was for tyrants strong, As things are many of great woorth, Which made it straight and woondrous long When at the first, they brought it foorth: And good it doth, and none ill deedes, Feeding vpon greene grasse and weedes. The high way, wheresoeuer it go, eateth vp the vesture of the earth. It was not created at the first, but is rather a priuation, then a thing made. And if men were makers of it, it was for the more part, rather with feete then with hands. By the Tyrants are meant, vse and necessitie: great rulers in the life of man. 7 [Beleeue me now I tell it for no tale] Beleeue me now I tell it for no tale, There is a Queene, or else a Goddesse t'one, That without helpe of man, or any male Conceaueth daughters by her selfe alone: But at their birth, be it by night or day, Some skilfull man, the midwiues part doth play. When they be borne, and perfectly brought foorth, Both olde and yong doe greatly them desire; Their beautie and their power is of such woorth, That all mens harts, therewith are set on fire: And in all times they beare as great a sway As if on earth, there were no queenes but they. It is meant, by the faire Ladie Tellus, which conceiueth in her wombe, the resplendent mettals of golde and siluer, the vnwoorthie burnished regents of the earth. 8 [A creature is that humane flesh deuoures] A creature is that humane flesh deuoures, From out whose bowels fatnesse may be taken, That being dried by fire, a certaine houres Will waxe as hard, as crust of bread well baken, Which fat dissolued, and with the leane confused Of that bodie, from whom you must it take, May be with skill and industrie so vsed, That a confection thereof we doe make Greatly helping, though it be held no woonder Against all tempest, lightning and thunder. The earth that beares vs shall deuoure vs. And of chalke which is accounted adeps terræ the fatnesse of the earth, mixed with sand (the cleanest earth) is made morter, for buildings to defend vs against all winde and weather. 9 [Handsome she was, and well beseene] Handsome she was, and well beseene, As fresh as any of them all, Her rament for the most part greene, Her stature good and meetely tall. Mounsier did take her by the arme And friendly entertained her, His countenance said he meant no harme, But well I wot he strained her, That (as lamenting her mishap) She cried perhaps she cracked too, Yet Mounsier would not leaue her lap For any thing that she could doo, This was a scholler by S. Anne, A ciuill, sober, honest manne. A description of a student sitting at his booke in a greene chaire, wherein he leand and lolled till it cracked. 10 [I wrinkled am and passing olde] I wrinkled am and passing olde But gallant is my motion, Abhorring aie to be controulde By any ones deuotion. Come all that list on me to mount, Sure I will not forsake them, But let them make their iust account, That finely I shall shake them. No doe I aske men ought for hose, For shooes, for drinke, or meating, Come all that list with me to close Sans paying or intreating. And they may chaunce finde in my wombe To make them wish they were at home. A description of the indomable wilde sea, whose waues are her wrincles: she is as wanton as any Westminster wagtaile, and for the bodie as perilous. 11 [Whilst Phebus lodgeth in his southerne Inne] Whilst Phebus lodgeth in his southerne Inne, His auncient Inne, at signe of Capricorne, His northren lasse, her raiment waxeth thinne, And for her Lord she seemes to pine and morne, I meane the lasse that many brings to scorne, And makes men oft reueale their proper shame, Her maker once, tooke to himselfe her name. The lasse is the vine, a true louer of the Sunne, for whome she mourneth, when he is run far southward. Her iuice hath compelled many to reueale their owne secrets, and not a few to lay open their owne shame. Christ called himselfe the vine. 13 [As Pallas was ingendred from her fathers braine] As Pallas was ingendred from her fathers braine, So was one other guest, that I see men doe entertaine, She sprang from neither grift, nor plant, nor egge nor seede, Ne is she fish, or flesh, or graine, or pulse or herbe or weede, With Ladies and great Lordes, she is both day and night, And clergie men, and prelats graue, sometime in her delight. Some thinke that the deuill, begat her on his dame, Because that he much euill doth and mischiefe by her frame: I thinke not so, but wish, she soberly were vsed, That neither she nor men by her, might hencefoorth be abused. It may well be vnderstood by cardplay. 14 [A virgine faire, betwixt whose milke white] A virgine faire, betwixt whose milke white Paps I sometime lay, When I was borne, the midwiues part And nurses too did play, To whom I spent, my formost age Working both day and night, And recompensed her taken care With profit and delight, Vntill by fate, without my fault In prison I was cast, And held in giues, which I had made, From which breaking at last: Such change and chaunces hath the world, A dorage made me blinde, In amorous sportes I kild my selfe Foole: propagating kinde. In the spring time, a yoong damsell putteth in her bosome, the egs of a silke worme: which being disclosed, the yoong worme, ere it be long, will fall to his naturall taske, till he hath inclosed himselfe in his huske. From which when he is broken out, he ioineth with the female, for preseruation of his kinde, and then voluntarily dieth. 15 [Vpon some pale, or pearch] Vpon some pale, or pearch, Or stond, or rotten tree, In watrie lowes and fennie grounds Where store of fishes bee: There will he gazing stand And fish he faine would eate, Bur he disdaines to touch a fish If that it be not great. Right good ones he lets goe, For better still to stay, Till that the sunne is welnigh set, And gone almost the day: Then downe vnto the ground In stately sort he hies, Where he a hungrie supper makes On wormes and butterflies. There is a bird, called in Italian, Perdigiornata, the daywaster: of this qualitie. And some men are of the like, that let go, all small offers, to expect better imployments. 16 [The welkin is welnigh, out of our seeing] The welkin is welnigh, out of our seeing, Our eies and thoughts are on the ground remaining, On th' earth or no, where is our happie being, Yet there we euer grudge, and are complayning, But turne vs so, that heauen hang in our spying, And straight we leaue, our murmur, and our crying. Swine saith Plutarch, to whome nature hath not giuen a looke, vp to the skies, are the most crying beasts in the world, euer grunting and complaining. But tie them by the heeles, and carrie them on a staffe whither ye will: so long as they see the cloudes, they are quiet and silent. And if men could learne to leaue wrooting in the earth, and place their cogitations in heauen, their tranquillitie should be the greater. 17 [One rips the earth, another cuts the seas] One rips the earth, another cuts the seas, And runs the world in circuite round about, All for my sake, I doe all men so please, That all doe seeke, which way to finde me out. In Diadems in scepters, and in Crownes, In robes, in rotchets, in a Cardnals hat, In scarlet, silkes, in costly furred gownes, In stones and pearles, and in I wot not what, In horses haukes, hounds, harlots, and in bookes, One flieth for me, vp into the skies, Another downe to Plutoes raigne he lookes, Where all this glistering Or and argent lies. This search declares, how greatly men doe leeke me, But they are mad so far from home to seeke me. But men hunt after felicitie, preposterously, with too much circuition: for it is best sought at home, in a quiet soule, and cleane conscience. 19 [After midnight, ere it was day] After midnight, ere it was day His eies he did vnclose, And striuing for to get away From prison he arose, With bodies two as colde as Leade He wrought so fine a feate, That other two which seemed dead Receiued life and heate. Then dead men came about him round, I wot not who they were, But of much thing deepe and profound With them he did confer. A student, rising from bed, with his flint and steele, giueth fire to the match and candle. The dead men which came about him, were S. Ambrose, S. Augustine &amp;c. or if ye will Plowden and my Lord Dyer. 20 [We are in number not fiue times fiue] We are in number not fiue times fiue, No one of vs two handfull long, Nor any of vs takes care to thriue, Yet all together we doe so throng, That if a man would list to striue T'extinguish or to doe vs wrong, Were he the greatest prince aliue, We should be found for him too strong, And could make him infamous in time to come, Though most of vs beene deafe and dombe. They are the leters of the alphabet: where of onely fiue are vocall, and the rest dumbe. 21 [By helpe of fiue, and sixe, and seuen] By helpe of fiue, and sixe, and seuen And lines and distances betweene, A scale is made that brings from heauen A virgine sweete that nere was seene, Nor any man euer see her shall, Though heauen and earth together fall. Vnseene, of louers she hath choice, That are not led by wanton eies, But they doe loue her Angels voice, And he that rules aboue the skies Doth daine a listening eare to lend, Her earnest praiers to attend. The scale of musicke, is made with lines and spaces. Fiue signed cliffesIn the original text there were musical notations which are not represented here.. Six voices, vt, re, my, fa, sol, la, and the seuen diapasons, a. b. c. d. e. f. g. 22 [I am not, but am said to bee] I am not, but am said to bee, And many things are told of mee, As first forsooth that I am blinde, And bushed before, and balde behinde: And that I halting come to one, And slie when as I will be gone: With fooles my godhead is not small, With wise men it is none at all. It is vnderstood of fortune. 23 [Svch as the companie is, such am I] Svch as the companie is, such am I, And I thinke some other folke are so too, To two Ladies great I euer am nie, And we with the world haue much to doo: Tis hard for a lowte to tell ye my name, And shame for a clerke if he hit not the same. An excellent expositour of heauenly mysteries, tooke this to be a looking glasse which receiueth the similitude of any thing, that commeth trauerse. The two great Ladies, he tooke to be pride and lecherie. But the propounder vnderstandeth this riddle, by the planet Mercurie, placed meane betwixt Venus and Luna: being (say the Astronomers) eiusdem naturæ, cum planeta cui coniungitur. 25 [This is the age that I would haue] This is the age that I would haue, These times for me are woondrous fit, Each Ladie that is fine and braue, With me delights to goe and sit. My liuing lieth not in my lands, Yet I am daintie, fine and sweete. The Ladies take me in their hands, Their lips and mine full often meete. Their paps, their cheekes I well may touch, In smiling sort with me they play, Their husbands thereat thinke not much, No: though I downe with them doe lay: In sooth it is a foolish sin, When foolish husbands iealous bin. A fan of feathers. 26 [Two forward went, and one did seeme to stay them] Two forward went, and one did seeme to stay them: Foure after ran, and fiue did ouerlay them, Of which one dead, foure quicke was comprehending: And all these twelue vnto one marke were tending. Viz. two cochehorses, one cocheman, fower wheeles, the bodie of the coche, and fower passengers. 27 [First I was small, and round like a pearle] First I was small, and round like a pearle, Then long and slender, as braue as an Earle, Since, like an hermit, I liude in a cell, And now like a rogue, in the wide world I dwell. First an egge, then a worme or canker: then inclosed in a huske, and last of all a butterflie. 28 [There is a bodie without a hart] There is a bodie without a hart, That hath a toong, and yet no head, Buried it was, ere it was made, And lowde it speakes, and yet is dead. A bell, when it is cast, is buried in the ground. 29 [Farre in the west I wot not wheare] Farre in the west I wot not wheare Are trees men say which oisters beare, I woonder how that comes about Those oisters she not, out of doubt And fall straight like a swarme of bees At home here on our apple trees. Growe they on trees, those oisters? fie: Me thinkes it soundeth like a lie, A kinde of trees, I know tis true, In purpoole lane beare oisters new And fish and flesh, and now and then They beare (I tell you) honest men. If euery man and woman be an arbor reuersa, then the shril oister queanes in Graies Inne lane, are trees and plants: though not so sweete to plant vpon, as be in other groues about London. 31 [I sawe one stately stalking like a crane] I sawe one stately stalking like a crane Strike at a stripling, something like a man, At the first stroke, he gaue the wretch his bane, Threw him in the dirt, and with him ran Vnto the water, where he washt and beate him, And at a mouthfull at the last he eate him. It was, if Æsope be a storie, the blocks successour, the woorthie king of frogs. Viz. a storke, deuouring one of his subiects, in Claxton garden. 32 [A murtherer, a prisoner, barely fed] A murtherer, a prisoner, barely fed Was first of all depriued of the light, And then straightwaies vnto the gallowes led, Which did belong to him of very right: Where hanged he was something against my will, Though some good folke could wish him hanged still. But one of power, the power of law to stay, That ere this time, did a companion make him: The prince himselfe came passing by that way, And from the gallowes graciously did take him: The best is though he did enioy this fauour, He standeth bound vnto the good behauiour. A hauke, first fed, then hooded, then set on a pearch: was soone after hanged by the heeles, and rescued by the master of the house, at Stokesbie. 33 [When one by one, men fearefull are] When one by one, men fearefull are They quickly are affrighted, And wanting weapons fit for warre, Not daring be vnited: Whether it be in towne or field To th' enimies forces soone they yeeld. A simple souldier God doth knowe, In Norfolke bloudie warres doth make, And heapes of foes, doth ouerthrowe Alone: and oft doth prisoners take: Yet they haue fortes, so hath not hee, Marry fearefull, and ill armed they be. The soldier, is our Norfolke tumbler which ouerthroweth multitudes of conies: that want both armour and courage to hold together. 34 [A lowe bred squire] A lowe bred squire Borne in the mire, That neuer knew who was his sire, Being armed light After midnight, (No remedie) would needes go fight. In corslet bad The youth was clad, And sarcenet sleeues forsooth he had. But at a word He had no sword, Nor other weapon woorth a &amp;c. Ne was he strong, Nor large nor long, But foorth he came with a hideous song. And Tartar leeke He me did seeke, Lighting at first full on my cheeke. This thing of naught, At face still raught, As Cesar once his souldiours taught When they should fight, Against that knight, Pompey defending countries right: So in like case, This varlet base Was euer poring at my face. I could not rest Within my nest, The rascall did me so molest. I had the Iacke, Soone brought to wracke, Had he not euer retired backe. But he comes, he goes, He fell, he rose, He bit me by the very nose. It made me sweare, And God to teare, I could not for my life forbeare. That such a knaue Should be so braue, Would make (I trowe) a Saint to raue. But clod or stone, Or sticke or bone, Or gunne or crosbowe had I none. That truth to showe, I did not knowe, Which way I might him ouerthrowe. So that at last I waxt agast, And longing t'haue the combate past. I hid my head Within a bed And slept like one that had been dead. He that hath laien one whole autumne at Stokesbie, shall vnderstand this ænigma well inough. A gnat is an ill chamber-fellow. 35 [A target-bearer to a gallant man of warre] A target-bearer to a gallant man of warre Was bidden by his Lord, t'attend him at a doore, Whilst he should get him in, about t'appease a iarre, That lately risen was, betwixt him and his whoore: And heare ye (saide he) Sirra: if any body come, Or stirring be this way, alowde see ye crie hum. The scutiger had tarried but a little while, Ere Morpheus gan vpon his forehead for to creepe, His stomacke vapours sent, which did his braines beguile, And ere he was aware, he falleth fast asleepe: The Master hoping well, that well his man did watch, Accorded with the girle, her husbands coate to patch. To kissing first they fell, and after that to play, Souldiers fight sometimes, ye wot it well in sport, And I can tell no more, what they did doe or say, God knowes I haue no skill of warring in this sort: But as the neighbours tolde, such warre the souldier maked, That at the locke they lay, and both of them were naked. Tacitum petiuit, my captaine falles asleepe, One in at window lookes, where close he them espied, And tarrying not a whit, either to laugh or weepe, He backward with the newes, vnto the husband hied, Which calde his friends vnto him, these pigeons for to get, And soone he had them both, caught fast within his net. The lookers on did laugh, the captaine was ashamed, The husband was as angrie, as any man could be, And though the wife by friends, and by her man were blamed, Yet made she her defence, and chid as fast as he: Thou hast (said she) ere this, thy slouens armefull borne, By stealth as we did now, of many a neighbours corne. She praies to be diuorced, but he would not agree To heare that motion made, it made his hart full sore To set them in a sheete, alas why should it bee, They had been sheeted now three howers and somwhat more. Forgiuenesse, that was best, the souldier him reuested, The goodman kissed his wife, all quarrels were digested. His squire still at the doore, this while lay fast asleepe, His helmet clapped close vnto his drowsie head, He dreamed that he sawe, a louely lasse to weepe, Inchained with his Lord vpon a feather bed: And in this dreame he lay still in a mischiefes name, Vntill his captaine came, and found him in the same. By shoulders he him tooke, he quickly made him wake, What was to him befalne, he did describe and tell, His angrie looke and noise, did make the wretch to shake, Villaine he cried, how saiest, hast thou not serude me well, Thou varlet base, thou asse, thou drunken headed ape, I thee coniure straight way, leaue of thy souldiers shape. His spurres to bodkins turned, his lips conuert to horne, His beard turned all to flesh, gone was his manly face, His shirt of maile and helmet, that he long had worne, To plumes and cockscombe turned, this was a foule disgrace: Behold and see, what tis, an angrie one to serue, That for a toy forgets, what seruing did deserue. He liueth still, and still retaines a souldiers minde, With Switzers he will go, when they are waged to fight, Vnto a lasse he is, more then his captaine kinde, And fiue or sixe at once, doe lodge with him all night: Remembring still the fault, that did him ouerthrowe, He cries at peepe of sunne, Looke to your windowes hooe. In Lucians dialog, betwixt the shoomaker and his cocke, ye shall finde that Mars, when he went to lie with Venus, left his man captaine Gallous or Gallus, to attend at the doore. Master Cocke fell in a nap, Phæbus looked in at the windowe, and discried the adulterie &amp;c. Euer since that day, euery cock at peepe of sunne (thinking Mars to be at his old occupation, or martialistes to be at their venerious exercise) croweth to giue them warning. 37 [With cordes they haled her from the ground] With cordes they haled her from the ground, And did about them lay, Like lustie ringers of the bels, Vpon some holiday. Her legs and armes close to a tree, She tottered vp and downe, Clap?pin?g her iron lined breech Close to a lubbers crowne: Whome she strooke downe into the ground, Full twenty foote and more, And yet he neuer did complaine, Or felt that he was sore. It describeth, the manner of driuing piles into the ground, wherewith are made firme, the foundations of buildings, set in meadowes, marshes and lowe places. 38 [Whilst I was yong, I dare well say] Whilst I was yong, I dare well say, I was as fresh as fairest May, And like a malapert yong else, As proudly did I beare my selfe. But pride men say, will haue a fall, Euen so had I, and therewithall To seruants seruant I became, And euery puzzell is my dame. When that I once haue done my worke, I am inforced in hurnes to lurke, Expecting when for want of meate, My fellow seruant should me eate. A broome, when it is well worne, and none other thing at hand, serueth to feede the fire withall. 39 [I louers had, had words been true] I louers had, had words been true, As many as faire Corinna had, Yet when my foes me ouerthrew, My friends looked on, and were right glad. When he that earst did me defend Vntill the day of dreadfull death Did hasten most vnto mine end, Striking the stroke which rest my breath, And from my graue men me remoue, Pretending still they doe me loue. Venison hath many louers. The hunters reioice when the dogs kill it, and commonly the foster or keeper is the chiefe murderer. The graue is made of pasticrust: and for sheere loue we take out the corse and eate it. 40 [A Coniurer was circling in the aire] A Coniurer was circling in the aire, With nimble eies attentiue on the ground, Where walking spirits, nousled many a paire, Making a search the harmelesse to confound, They wrought to reaue poore wretches of their breath, Which neuer in life did ought deseruing death. I saide to an abettor looking on, Those innocents were woorthie of some pittie, He answere made, and sware by sweete S. Iohn, In pitying them, I shewed my selfe not wittie: What skils (saide he) the shedding of their blood, They doe me harme: but doe they any good? A lanner or falcon, lying in for her game, whilest the dogs hunted to spring it. 41 [Mounsier Monoculus, with that one eie] Mounsier Monoculus, with that one eie, Its not for his personage or his sweete face, That wheresoere I goe, I doe him espie, With maidens and wiues in speciall grace, He is a surgeon, he can let blood, His pricke is a thing that doth them good. A needle. 43 [I doe agree with sister and brother] I doe agree with sister and brother, But I loue neither father nor mother, If she imbrace me, she makes me die, If he doe but touch me I cracke and crie, And surely it is a preatie thing, To see how he makes me fart and fling: Maruell you sirs, who I should bee, On sunday before noone you may me see. Salt, receiueth forme by fire, the substance of it is water: and yet fire or water will destroy it. 44 [I haue in the countrie seene at a faire] I haue in the countrie seene at a faire, Of brethren and sisters many a paire, That being coupled like man and wife, Went yet to seruice for terme of life, But they could neither wash nor wring, Nor brue, nor bake, nor play, nor sing, Nor pipe, nor daunce, nor any such thing: All that they can, is well to keepe All things, except great flocks of sheepe. Most of our things, are kept vnder locke and key: except sheepe here in England. 45 [Ovr parents are euer besmeared with dust] Ovr parents are euer besmeared with dust, Our sisters and brethren in very good trust: Our chips euer gaping, or if they meete iust, Some one thing or other in sunder must. It may be vnderstood, of a paire of sheares. 46 [Let neuer woonder fill your head] Let neuer woonder fill your head, For sure the case is plaine and cleere, By slug gish keeping of my bed, I lost a thousand pound a yeere: My brother rose, and did it get, And I am to his keeping set. I knew a gentleman, that would say he lost, a thousande pounds a yeere, by lying but one hower too long in bed. For his eldest brother was borne, not past one hower before him. 47 [The Miller, and the Millers wife] The Miller, and the Millers wife, That they might merrie make, Were set downe with a dish of fruite, A cake, and halfe a cake, The parson of the towne with them, His sister and no more: Now haue you heard of all the guests, And of their bread the store, Yet did they vse the matter with Such cunning, skill, and art, That euerie one eate halfe a cake, Before they did depart. The milners wife, was the parsons sister: and so the diuision not hard to make. 49 [That which a sheepe did inward hide] That which a sheepe did inward hide, I vse to weare on my outside, And that which a tree did outward weare, Within me alwaies I doe beare: By drowning first I tooke essence, And hanged was since for none offence: Still ready by a blast of breath, To finde a life causing my death. A candle. 50 [Al day leeke one thats in disgrace] Al day leeke one thats in disgrace, He resteth in some secret place, And seldome putteth foorth the head, Vntill daylight be fully fled, Then in the maides, or goodwiues hand, The gallant ginnes first vp to stand: Whom to a hole, they doe apply, Wherein he will both liue and die. A candle. 51 [On an euening as colde, as colde might bee] On an euening as colde, as colde might bee, With frost and haile, and pinching weather, Companions about three times three, Lay close all in a pound together: Yet one after one, they tooke a heate, And died that night, all in a sweate. A pound of candles. 52 [A remnant of a soule, the water did inclose] A remnant of a soule, the water did inclose, That staide by one, from fire, which did repaire, That fenced by one, which from the earth arose, And all kept warme by one, which grew vp in the aire: The goodwife out of these, did deale about her dole, Till one did put his nose, euen right into her hole. Plants haue a sweete vegetancie. The riddle is vnderstood of a glasse with sweet water, inclosed with bents, or some such matter, and also wrapt vp in wooll. Now if the glasse were the goodwiues glasse, then possessorily though not naturally the glasses mouth, whereunto one smelled, was the goodwiues hole. 53 [If Lords of the land esteeme me not a flie] If Lords of the land esteeme me not a flie, If daintie nosed doctors, crie fie on me fie, If Ladies at Court, none account on me make, If citizens wiues, doe me all forsake, Then Ioane in the countrie, for a friend I will take: What though from my youth, I haue had a white head, My taile will be greene, vntill I be dead. Garlicke &amp;c. 55 [An idle braine, and wanton eie] An idle braine, and wanton eie, Breedes in the hart, sometime a goose, Thats often kept full hungrily, Whilst lecherie, iugling fast and loose, Doth gaine his bushell for each oate, That comes into the gozlings throate. Loue is a foole. 56 [Enuie and loue, together hatcht a beast] Enuie and loue, together hatcht a beast, Or hag of hell it rather seemes to mee, That pines if other comes but neere her feast, And willingly would euer watching bee, Things that are not, this enuies bird would see: This parricide, this errour whelping sprite, This Sibill false, seldome diuining right. Ielousie is a feend. 57 [There is a thing, some call it sport] There is a thing, some call it sport, (That yong and olde, and all will prooue) Tis musicke in a kind-consort, On tuned instruments of loue, The fashion something bagpipe like, With poke and pipe the minstrels plaie, And if the bommes iust measure strike, Tis pastime for a wedding day: Maides that to this their mindes applie, For Lute and harpe care not a flie. Lecherie is made a solace. 58 [A Tree, a beast, an angell, all in one] A Tree, a beast, an angell, all in one Liues, and hath rule ouer both beast and tree, That oft, is after goatishnesse so gone, That there is no beast, beastlier than hee. Bridle the beast, monster, mishapen thing, Least tree, beast, angell, to the deuill fling. Those women and men are happie, whose rationall and intellectuall part, hath her iust and full dominion, ouer the materiall and sensuall. 59 [To th' earth from highest heauen] To th' earth from highest heauen, Foure virgins were descended, Sent downe from him that vnto men All goodnesse hath intended. And here they staide a while, And many things amended, But they were forced backe by those, That should haue them defended. Since then the golden age, The happie daies were ended, And vice hath raigned most in them, That vertue most pretended. Amitie, peace, iustice and shamefastnes, are gifts and great blessings of God. Of which the two first (as I haue red) a great while since, were chased from earth by princes: the third by lawyers, and the fourth by women. I had the substance of this riddle from Italie. Let it therefore tax and reprehend, roitelets, dukes and potentates, for their diuisions: aduocates for their iniustice: and women for their impudence, onely in Italie. We hold it in England, that a shamelesse woman, wanteth the properest ornament of her sex. FINIS.</field>
