      <field name="fulltext">âLord, save Me.â âA Ruined sinner, lost, undone,âLord Jesus, hear my cry: The brand of guilt is on my soul; Lord, save me, or I die.â âI will, thou wreck'd and ruin'd one: before thee, lo, I stand; Upon my bosom throw thyself, and grasp my pierced hand. I will not spurn thee from my side for all thy rags and chains, I love thee;âcome to me, and wash thy dark and crimson stains.â âTen thousand talents, Lord, I owe,ânothing have I to pay; I dare not come, whose nakedness would shame the light of day.â âCome unto me, thou bankrupt soul; why dost thou linger yet? With my own life-blood I have paid the last mite of thy debt. My wealth, my goodness, give I thee, and, for thy royal dress, Will clothe thee with a seamless robe, my perfect righteousness.â âI fain would come, I fain would pray, my tears alone must speak; I come;âyet seems my strengthless heart too wayward and too weak.â âI come to thee, come thou to me, thou weary one, and rest; And my meek Spirit shall abide within thy troubled breast. His life and love, His power and peace, His majesty and might, Are with thee; listen to his voice; He speaks, and there is light.â âI come, he draws me; I am thine, Lord Jesus, Thou art mine. I ask no more, if only thus upon me Thou wilt shine.â âMy Father loves thee, and I love; my Spirit dwells in thee: Herein is life, and joy, and heaven, and immortality. But haply clouds will come, and hide thy Saviour from thine eyes; Say, wilt thou love me on beneath those future wintry skies?â âI only cast me on Thee, Lord; I love Thee, though unseen; But when shall this dividing veil be raised that hangs between?â âPress onward, ransomed one, press on to that celestial realm: The voyage may be rough and long, but I am at the helm: The wilderness is void and vast; but, see, I go before thee: The battle may be fierce; but I lead on before to glory.â âAnd shall I never leave Thy side upon that blissful shore, But see Thee in Thy glorious home, and love Thee evermore?â âFor everâthou shalt share my throne, my Father's face behold, And swell the rapturous melodies of thousand harps of gold, Fear not, for I will greet thee with my well-remember'd smile: Press on, be faithful unto deathâ'tis but a little while.â 1853. E. H. B. The Hiding Place. âA man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind and a covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a day place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.ââIsaiah xxxii. 2. O Jesus, Saviour of the lost, My rock and hiding-place; By storms of sin and sorrow tost I seek thy sheltering grace. Guilty, forgive me, Lord, I cry; Pursued by foes I come; A sinner, save me, or I die; An outcast,âtake me home. Once safe in Thine Almighty arms, Let storms come on amain; There danger never never harms, There death itself is gain. And when I stand before Thy throne, And all Thy glory see; Still be my righteousness alone, To hide myself in Thee. 1850. E. H. B. The Things that are. Psalm ciii. 13; Jeremiah iii. 4. A FRAGMENT. Oh, hast thou known the yearnings of delight It is to commune with a tender father, To cast the burden of a host of cares Upon his father-heart, to feel thyself His child, and in that blessed privilege To ask his sympathy, his care, his love, And with a deep familiar earnestness Blend all thy thoughts with his, with filial fear Yet fearless in affection? If thou hast, Thou knowest an emblem, faint indeed and dim, But yet the brightest, loveliest earth affords Of the joy-fountains gushing in the heart Of one, who, from the world a fugitive, And from despair, and darkness, and thick doubt, Finds there is yet one bosom where to cast His sorrows, and a Father's heart that glows For him, and yearns to greet him as a child. Entranced, imparadised in joy, I knelt There at the footstool of my Father's throne, My Father's and my God's, and from His smile Drank life, drank beauty, drank intensest love, From love, and life, and beauty's fountain-head. I may not tell ye moreâbut when that dream Of gloryâ(if ye reckon those things dreams That have a deep and vast reality Beyond all certainties of sight and sense, As reaching the unseen eternal world)â Had pass'd me, like a golden sunset cloud, My soul was as a sea of light, whereon No grief did cast a shadow; such as oft Thou mayst have seen within a summer sky, Sleeping untroubled in calm mellow light, Above the spot where the sun's chariot wheels Sank slowly into ocean. Yes, it pass'd, But yet I felt it was my own for ever, A wealth, a rapture, an inheritance. 1845. E. H. B. The Favouritisms of Heaven. Galatians vi. 8. A FRAGMENT. Lean thy heart on mine, beloved,âlistenâI have heard men say That the fondnesses of earth will pass with earthly things away; There, they say, we all are one, and none can love thee least or best, But as brethren all are equal thro' the myriads of the blest. It may be an idle questionâbe my wayward heart forgivenâ How earth's love shall wear the gorgeous bright apparelling of heaven: It may be we are too venturous, for the light is faint and dim, And but little knows the pilgrim of the life of seraphim: Yet I love to think, mine own one, I shall love thee there as here, Best of all created beings, best of all that angel sphere. Read we not of earth the seed-time for the glorious world to come? Faith receiving there her guerdon, sin her saddestâdreariestâdoom? Have not all the things of life-time issues infinite above?â And shall love reap there no harvest of the scatter'd seeds of love? What if now we steep affection oft in weeping, oft in sighs,â They who sow in tears, beloved, reap the rapture of the skies. True that we can tell but little how the full flood-tide of love Swells from out a thousand rivulets in a thousand hearts above; True we know not now the rapture, nor a thousandth thousandth part, Seeing Him we loved unseen, and face to face and heart to heart, Not a cloud to dim that sunshine, there no sorrow, no alarms, But around thee and beneath thee spread the Everlasting armsâ There untravell'd worlds of beauty slow unfolding on our sight, Spann'd by heaven's eternal rainbow, interwoven love and light. But those glories none may utterâhow should I then tell it thee? For how faint and far the glimmerings of the waves of heaven's Light-sea! Yet, mine own one, tell me truly, think'st thou we shall love the less? Will that ocean whelm the fountains of thine own true-heartedness? Hark, thy beating heart makes answer in its old familiar tone, âAll thine own on earth, beloved, and in glory all thine own.â 1844. E. H. B. Oh! tread lightly. LINES ON A SUFFERING SISTER. âHe giveth his beloved sleep.ââPsalm cxxvii. 2. I Oh, tread lightlyâshe is weary, She hath suffer'd all day through, And the night is somewhat dreary If she wake and suffer too: Silently the stars are keeping Their sweet vigils o'er her, And she dreams not in her sleeping That to-morrow is before her. II Break it not, that spell of slumber, Waveless, beautiful as heaven, 'Mid the sharp gusts without number, And the clouds, of tempests driven. Weep not, sisterâsister, cheer thee, Yet she will not hear thee weep: She is weary, very weary, Only let her sleep. III I could fancy, gazing on her, She had pass'd her night of sighs; And that heaven's own light upon her, Waits to greet her opening eyes. Silence on each word of sorrow, On a thought that would repine, For there shall be such a morrow, And for thee, sweet sister mine. IV Ah! I know it, that reposingâ 'Tis her Father bade it comeâ Emblem, when life's day is closing, Of the deep repose of home; Storms the joy of calm redoubling In the mansions of the blest; Where the wicked cease from troubling, And the weary are at rest. 1847. E. H. B. Yes, Billow after Billow. LINES ON A SUFFERING SISTER. âAnd so he bringeth them to the haven where they would be.ââPsalm cvii. 30. Yes, billow after billowâsee they come Faster and rougher, as her little boat Nears evermore the haven. Oftentimes It seems to sink and fall adown the wave, As if borne backward by the struggling tide: Yet mounting billow after billow, wave On wave o'er-riding, tempest-tost and shatter'd, Still, still it nears the haven evermore. âPoor mariner! art thou not sadly weary?â Dear brother, rest is sweeter after toil. âGrows not thine eye confused and dim with sight âOf nothing but the wintry waters?â True, But then my pole-star, constant and serene, Above the changing waters changes not. âBut what if clouds, as often, veil the sky?â Oh, then an unseen hand hath ever ta'en The rudder from my feeble hands the whileâ And I cling to it. âAnswer me once more, âMariner, what think'st thou when the waters bear âThy frail boat backward from the long'd-for harbour?â Oh, brother, though innumerable waves Still seem to rise betwixt me and my homeâ Still billow after billow, wave on waveâ I know that they are number'd: not one less Should bear me homeward if I had my will; For One who knows what tempests are to weather, Oe'r whom there broke the wildest billows once, He bids these waters swell. In His good time The last rough wave shall bear me on its bosom Into the haven of eternal peace. No billows afterâthey are number'd, brother. âOh, gentle mariner, steer on, steer on: âMy tears still flow for thee, but they are tears âIn which faith strives with grief, and overcomes.â 1847. E. H. B. The Village Evening Hymn. âStrangers and pilgrims on the earth.ââHebrews xi. 13. Hark, the nightly church-bell numbers One day more with bygone things; Saviour, o'er our peaceful slumbers Spread thy everlasting wings. One day less of sin and sadness, One day nearer heaven and home: Travellers to light and gladness, Onward stage by stage we roam. One day less of toil and labour, One day nearer rest, and Thee. Child and parent, friend and neighbour, Lift your voice, and bend your knee. Blessed Spirit, hover o'er us, Sleeping, waking, be Thou near; Comrades, there is joy before us, Rest in peace, and rise to prayer. 1853. E. H. B: The Holy Communion. âI drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.ââMatt. xxvi. 29. He fill'd the cup with wine, and saidâ âO drink ye all of this; For thus my life-blood shall be shed To ransom souls for bliss. âI will not drink thereof again Until I drink it new, Where tears its brightness shall not stain, In glory and with you. âEre then ten thousand thousand times My table shall be spread, And countless souls in distant climes Be comforted and fed. âGrace, mercy, peace, be multiplied To those who commune there!â While seated by my Father's side Their mansion I prepare. âBut now these lips a different cup For you must taste and drain, And unrepiningly drink up The dregs of bitter pain. âThe griefs ye know not that are mine, Nor yet my glories see, But break the bread and drink the wine, And thus remember me.â E. H. B. The Branch and the Vine. âAbide in me.ââJohn xv. 4. âAbide in me, and I in you:â Ah, blessed, sweet commands; Soft as the fall of early dew, On parched, thirsty lands. Abide in Thee, my Lord my God, Omnipotent to save From all the dangers of my road, From Satan and the grave. In Thee, whose wisdom none can tell, Whose grace no limit knows; Whose love divine, unsearchable, A boundless ocean flows. Then welcome joy, and farewell fear, And calm, ye wild waves, be; If only, Lord, thy voice I hear, âMy child, abide in me.â 1849. E. H. B. The Parting Vision. A FACT. âAnd was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom.â âLuke xvi. 22. My eyes are very dim, mother, I cannot see you right; Sit near, and read my favourite hymn, For I shall die to-night. âJesus who lived,ââyes, that, mother, I learned it on your knee; Well I remember where you sate, When first you taught it me. Oh yes, read on and on, mother, The words that Jesus said: And think, long after I am gone, He bore our sins instead. Is the rush candle out, mother? For all is midnight dark; Oh, take my handâI will not doubt: See motherâmother, hark! Oh bright and blessed things, mother, My soul it is that sees; Yet feel you not the rush of wings Makes musical the breeze? Kind faces throng the room, mother, Aud gentle loving eyes: Do you not hear, âCome, sister, come,â My welcome to the skies? Is this the happy land, mother? My heart is almost still.â The childless mother felt her hand All in a moment chill. 1851. E. H. B. The Penitent's Death-bed. âAs many as touched the hem of his garment were made perfectly whole.â A cold and wild autumnal skyâthe sun was sinking fast, And bleakly blew o'er wood and wold the wintry northern blast; The chill rain fell in sudden gusts, still drifting on and on, The day had pass'd in storms, and night would now be here anon. Around the far horizon's skirts despairing roved the eye, When lo! a rainbow-fragment stamp'd upon that stormy sky. Broken and quivering it lay, one little fragment given From some few flickering beams of light far in the western heaven: The trembling colours came and went, and fainter, brighter grew Amid that wild, untender sky, so tender and so true. I just had left the dying bed of one who once had been A wanderer from the Saviour's fold in the gloomy paths of sinâ A wreck of sweetness and of grace, a shade of beauty now, Though Death had set its awful seal too plainly on her brow. Oh, surely life to her had been a life of guilt and tearsâ Of blighted hopes and shatter'd dreams, and storms of guilty fears! But, on a sudden, in the midst of youth and pleasure's prime, The icy blast of death blew keen athwart that summer clime. The world's allurements shrivell'd then, like leaves in wind and frost, And all its lying blandishments their sometime glory lost. Earth trembled, and the sky was gloom, and all within was wild, And death full quickly now would claim its own unhappy child. Stay, list!âa sudden ray from heaven gleam'd in upon her cell!â âThe Saviourââeagerly she caught the accents as they fellâ âThe Saviour came to save the lostâJesus for sinners died.â âFor sinners?âOh, the worst am I of sinners,â she replied. âThen cast on Him thy load of guiltâHe bids thee come and live.â âI cannot, yet I would,â she cried; âLord, hear me, Lord, forgive!â It was not peace, it was not light, nor was it all despair, And pointing her to Jesus still, I left her after prayer. It was not sunshine, nor the joy of heaven's own glorious bow, Yet surely one true little gleam of mercy amid woe,â One fragmentary rainbow-spot that might grow brighter yet, And faintly promised better things before the sun was set. 1848. E. H. B. The Rock of Ages. âJesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.â âHebrews xiii. 8. We here have no abiding home, We claim no fatherland: but, driven By life's rough changes, onward roam, Earth's pilgrims, denizens of heaven. Yes, all things change around us; years Fleet on, and comrades pass away; The shadows of this vale of tears Speed past us, nor will brook delay. How blessed on this changing sea, Whose sleepless waters sink and swell, To know one rock of truth to be Unchanging and unchangeable. Jesus, our God and Saviour thou! The same from endless ages past, The same in grace and glory now, And while eternity shall last. 1849. E. H. B. The Trumpet of Jubilee. âTrumpets of silver.ââNumbers x. 2. Oh, brothers, lift your voices, Triumphant songs to raise; Till heaven on high rejoices, And earth is fill'd with praise. Ten thousand hearts are bounding With holy hopes, and free; The Gospel trump is sounding, The trump of Jubilee. Oh, Christian brothers! glorious Shall be the conflict's close: The cross hath been victorious, And shall be o'er its foes. Faith is our battle-token; Our banner love unrols; Our trophies, fetters broken; Our captives, ransom'd souls. Not unto usâLord Jesus, To thee all praise be due! Whose blood-bought mercy frees us, Has freed our brethren too. âNot unto usââin glory The angels catch the strain, And cast their crowns before thee Exultingly again. Captain of our salvation, Thy presence we adore! Praise, glory, adoration Be thine for evermore. Still on in conflict pressing On thee thy people call, Thee, King of kings, confessing, Thee crowning Lord of all. 1849. E. H. B. The Advent. âHallelujah: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.â âRev. xix. 6. Hallelujah! he cometh with clouds and with light, And the trumpet of God, in the silence of night: Heaven's armies before him adoringly bend, And thousands of thousands his bidding attend. Hallelujah! he cometh: and every eye Beholds him with anguish or rapturous joy; A wailing is heard from the kindreds of earth, It is drown'd in Hosannas of heavenly mirth. Hallelujah! he cometh: the judgment is set, And the nations are gather'd in crowds to his feet; The earth and the ocean have yielded their dead, And the records of time are unfolded and read. Hallelujah! earth crumbles in ashes and dust, While calmly he severs the wicked and just, The shadows of darkness are driven away, And the morning has dawn'd of eternal day. 1850. E. H. B. The Heavenly Harpers. âHarpers harping with their harps.ââRevelation xiv. 2. On the hill of Zion standing, Lo! the Lamb of God appears: Scenes of glory far expanding Far above this vale of tears; Songs of rapture, falling sweet on mortal ears. Lo! he comes! with awful wonder Hark, those strains of joy untold; Deepening on and on like thunder Never learnt or sung of old:â Blissful harpers, harping on their harps of gold. Lo! he comes! in heaven appearing, Mark yon herald angel's flight, Glad eternal tidings bearing To the lands of heathen night. O'er the nations breaks a flood of Gospel light. Lo! he comes! the heavens unfold him; King of Kings, he comes to reign; Crown'd, enthroned ye saints, behold him, Once for you baptized in pain. Come, Lord Jesus! Even so, Amen, Amen. 1849. E. H. B. Translated, not Confirmed. To One who with me watched the parting hours of a Candidate for confirmation. Together we leant O'er her fragile form, As her head she bent To the long last storm. There was nothing of fear In that dying room, For Jesus was near And chased its gloom. We asked if she felt His presence was nigh, And the deep answer dwelt In her up-lighted eye. âHave you cast on His cross The weight of your sin? Is the world but loss? Is there peace within?â On the calm of that hour, Why farther press, When we knew the power Of her gentle âYes?â She is goneâas a child On its mother's breast; She looked up, and smiled, And sank to rest. The waves are all pass'd, The word has been given, Though roughest at last, They have borne her to heaven. But âa little while,â And our summons will comeâ Oh, then with her smile To ascend to her home! 1852. E. H. B. The Three Birthdays. To the memory of One who, in blindness and suffering, but in the full assurance of faith, said a few hours before her death, that she had always heard that three birthdays were ours:âour natural birthday, our spiritual birthday, and our birthday into glory: and that she was sure the last was the brightest and the best. Joy for thee, newborn child of heaven! once there was joy on earth, What time from eager lip to lip ran tidings of thy birth, And glad hearts beat more gladly, and quick steps more quickly trod To tell that home was richer with another gift from God. Years fleeted byâuntil beneath the brooding of the Dove, Thy heart was warm'd and waken'd to the voice of heavenly love; Then deeper waves of joy across their golden harp strings stole, As angels sang before the throne the birthday of thy soul. Years fleeted by, and still thy path grew brighter and more bright, And stars from daylight hidden, gemm'd the clear sky of thy night. Thy spirit drank of rivulets, that never could run dry; And suffering never seem'd to cloud the summer of thy sky. And all who knew thee, loved thee; and they loved thee most of all, Who mark'd thy patient waiting for thy Master's long'd-for call: It came, at last, that joy of joys, the latest and the best, The birthday of a child of heaven,âthe dawn of perfect rest. Dear sainted sister, we rejoice, the more we weep our loss; And while we think upon thy crown, more humbly bear our cross. For in our heart of hearts is heard the calm prophetic warning, The bridal of the Church is near, her glory's natal morning. 1861. E. H. B.</field>
