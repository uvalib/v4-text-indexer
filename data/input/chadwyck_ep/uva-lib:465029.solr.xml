      <field name="fulltext">MORAL ECLOGUES. At secura quies, et nescia fallere vita, Dives opum variarum; at latis otia fundis, SpeluncÃ¦, vivique lacus; at frigida Tempe, Mugitusque boum, mollesque sub arbore somni Non absunt. Illic saltus, ac lustra ferarum, Et patiens operum parvoque assueta juventus, Sacra deÃ»m, sanctique patres: extrema per illos Justitia excedens terris vestigia fecit. Virg. Georg. II. 1. 467. ECLOGUE I. THERON; or, the Praise of Rural Life. SCENE, a Heath: Season, Spring; Time, Morning. Fair Spring o'er Nature held her gentlest sway; Fair Morn diffus'd around her brightest ray; Thin mists hung hovering on the distant trees, Or roll'd from off the fields before the breeze. The Shepherd Theron watch'd his fleecy train, Beneath a broad oak, on the grassy plain. A heath's green wild lay pleasant to his view, With shrubs and field-flowers deck'd of varied hue: There hawthorns tall their silver bloom disclos'd, Here flexile broom's bright yellow interpos'd; There purple orchis, here pale daisies spread, And sweet May-lilies richest odour shed. From many a copse and blossom'd orchard near, The voice of birds melodious charm'd the ear; There shrill the lark and soft the linnet sung, And loud through air the throstle's musick rung. The gentle Swain the chearful scene admir'd; The chearful scene the song of joy inspir'd. âChant on,â he cry'd, âye warblers on the spray! âBleat on, ye flocks, that in the pastures play! âLow on, ye herds, that range the dewy vales! âMurmur, ye rills! and whisper soft, ye gales! âHow blest my lot, in these sweet fields assign'd, âWhere Peace and Leisure sooth the tuneful mind; âWhere yet some pleasing vestiges remain âOf unperverted Nature's golden reign, âWhen Love and Virtue rang'd Arcadian shades, âWith undesigning youths and artless maids! âFor us, though destin'd to a later time, âA less luxuriant soil, less genial clime, âFor us the country boasts enough to charm, âIn the wild woodland or the cultur'd farm. âCome, Cynthio, come! in town no longer stay; âFrom crouds, and noise, and folly, haste away! âThe fields, the meads, the trees, are all in bloom, âThe vernal show'rs awake a rich perfume. âWhere Damon's mansion, by the glassy stream, âRears its white walls that thro' green willows gleam, âAnnual the neighbours hold their shearing-day; âAnd blithe youths come, and nymphs in neat array: âThose shear their sheep, upon the smooth turf laid, âIn the broad plane's or trembling poplar's shade; âThese for their friends th'expected feast provide, âBeneath cool bowers along th' inclosure's side. âTo view the toil, the glad repast to share, âThy Delia, my Melania, shall be there; âEach, kind and faithful to her faithful swain, âLoves the calm pleasures of the pastoral plain. âCome, Cynthio, come! If towns and crouds invite, âAnd noise and folly promise high delight; âSoon the tir'd soul disgusted turns from theseâ âThe rural prospect, only, long can please!â ECLOGUE II. PALEMON; or, Benevolence. SCENE, a Wood-side on the Brow of a Hill: Season, Summer; Time, Forenoon. Bright fleecy clouds flew scattering o'er the sky, And shorten'd shadows shew'd that noon was nigh; When two young Shepherds, in the upland shade, Their listless limbs upon the greensward laid. Surrounding groves the wandering sight confin'dâ All, save where, westward, one wide landscape shin'd. Down in the dale were neat inclosures seen, The winding hedge-row, and the thicket green; Rich marshland next a glossy level show'd, And thro' grey willows silver rivers flow'd: Beyond, high hills with towers and villas crown'd, And waving forests, form'd the prospect's bound. Sweet was the covert where the Swains reclin'd! There spread the wild rose, there the woodbine twin'd; There stood green fern; there, o'er the grassy ground, Sweet camomile and alehoof crept around; And centaury red and yellow cinquefoil grew, And scarlet campion, and cyanus blue; And tufted thyme, and marjoram's purple bloom, And ruddy strawberries yielding rich perfume. Gay flies their wings on each fair flower display'd, And labouring bees a lulling murmur made. Along the brow a path delightful lay; Slow by the youths Palemon chanc'd to stray, A Bard, who often to the rural throng, At vacant hours rehears'd the moral song! The song the Shepherds crav'd; the Sage reply'd: âAs late my steps forsook the fountain side, âAdown the green lane by the beechen grove, âTheir flocks young Pironel and Larvon drove; âWith us perchance they'll rest awhileââThe Swains Approach'd the shade; their sheep spread o'er the plains: Silent they view'd the venerable man, Whose voice melodious thus the lay began. âWhat Alcon sung where Evesham's vales extend, âI sing; ye Swains, your pleas'd attention lend! âThere long with him the rural life I led, âHis fields I cultur'd, and his flocks I fed. âWhere, by the hamlet road upon the green, âStood pleasant cots with trees dispers'd between, âBeside his door, as waving o'er his head âA lofty elm its rustling foliage spread, âFrequent he sat; while all the village train âPress'd round his seat, and listen'd to his strain. âAnd once of fair Benevolence he sung, âAnd thus the tuneful numbers left his tongue: âYe youth of Avon's banks, of Bredon's groves, âSweet scenes, where Plenty reigns, and Pleasure roves! âWoo to your bowers Benevolence the fair, âKind as your soil, and gentle as your air. âShe comes! her tranquil step, and placid eye, âFierce Rage, fell Hate, and ruthless Avarice fly. âShe comes! her heav'nly smiles, with powerful charm, âSmooth Care's rough brow, and rest Toil's weary arm. âShe comes! ye Shepherds, importune her stay! âWhile your fair farms exuberant wealth display, âWhile herds and flocks their annual increase yield, âAnd yellow harvests load the fruitful field; âBeneath grim Want's inexorable reign, âPale Sickness, oft, and feeble Age complain! âWhy this unlike allotment, save to show, âThat who possess, possess but to bestow?â Palemon ceas'd.ââSweet is the sound of gales âAmid green osiers in the winding vales; âSweet is the lark's loud note on sunny hills, âWhat time fair Morn the sky with fragrance fills; âSweet is the nightingale's love-soothing strain, âHeard by still waters on the moonlight plain! âBut not the gales that thro' green osiers play, âNor lark's nor nightingale's melodious lay, âPlease like smooth numbers by the Muse inspir'd!ââ Larvon reply'd, and homeward all retir'd. ECLOGUE III. ARMYN; or, The Discontented. SCENE, a Valley: Season, Summer; Time, Afternoon. Summer o'er heav'n diffus'd serenest blue, And painted earth with many a pleasing hue; When Armyn mus'd the vacant hour away, Where willows o'er him wav'd their pendent spray. Cool was the shade, and cool the passing gale, And sweet the prospect of the adjacent vale: The fertile soil, profuse of plants, bestow'd The crowfoot's gold, the trefoil's purple show'd, And spiky mint rich fragrance breathing round, And meadsweet tall with tufts of flowrets crown'd, And comfry white, and hoary silver-weed, The bending osier, and the rustling reed. There, where clear streams about green islands spread, Fair flocks and herds, the wealth of Armyn, fed; There, on the hill's soft slope, delightful view! Fair fields of corn, the wealth of Armyn, grew. His sturdy hinds, a slow laborious band, Swept their bright scythes along the level land: Blithe youths and maidens nimbly near them past, And the thick swarth in careless wind-rows cast. Full on the landscape shone the westering sun, When thus the Swain's soliloquy begun: âHaste down, O Sun! and close the tedious day: âTime, to the unhappy, slowly moves away. âNot so, to me, in Roden's sylvan bowers, âPass'd Youth's short blissful reign of careless hours; âWhen to my view the fancy'd future lay, âA region ever tranquil, ever gay. âO then, what ardors did my breast inflame! âWhat thoughts were mine, of friendship, love, and fame! âHow tasteless life, now all its joys are try'd, âAnd warm pursuits in dull repose subside!â He paus'd: his closing words Albino heard, As down the stream his little boat he steer'd; His hand releas'd the sail, and dropt the oar, And moor'd the light skiff on the sedgy shore. âCease, gentle Swain,â he said; âno more, in vain, âThus make past pleasure cause of present pain! âCease, gentle Swain,â he said; âfrom thee, alone, âAre youth's blest hours and fancy'd prospects flown? âAh, no!âremembrance to my view restores âDear native fields, which now my soul deplores; âRich hills and vales, and pleasant village scenes âOf oaks whose wide arms stretch'd o'er daisied greens, âAnd wind-mill's sails slow-circling in the breeze, âAnd cottage-walls envelop'd half with treesâ âSweet scenes, where Beauty met the ravish'd sight, âAnd Music often gave the ear delight; âWhere Delia's smile, and Mira's tuneful song, âAnd Damon's converse, charm'd the youthful throng! âHow chang'd, alas, how chang'd!âO'er all our plains, âProud Norval, now, in lonely grandeur reigns; âHis wide-spread park a waste of verdure lies, âAnd his vast villa's glittering roofs arise. âFor me, hard fate!âBut say, shall I complain? âThese limbs yet active Life's support obtain. âLet us, or good or evil as we share, âThat thankful prize, and this with patience bear.â The soft reproach touch'd Armyn's gentle breast; His alter'd brow a placid smile exprest. âCalm as clear ev'nings after vernal rains, âWhen all the air a rich perfume retains, âMy mind,â said he, âits murmurs driv'n away, âFeels Truth's full force, and bows to Reason's sway!â He ceas'd: the sun, with horizontal beams, Gilt the green mountains, and the glittering streams. Slow down the tide before the sinking breeze, Albino's white sail gleam'd among the trees; Slow down the tide his winding course he bore To watry Talgar's aspin-shaded shore. Slow cross the valley, to the southern hill, The steps of Armyn sought the distant vill, Where thro' tall elms the moss-grown turret rose; And his fair mansion offer'd sweet repose. ECLOGUE IV. LYCORON; or, The Unhappy. SCENE, a Valley: Season, Autumn; Time, Evening. The matron, Autumn, held her sober reign O'er fading foliage on the russet plain: Mild Evening came; the moon began to rise, And spread pale lustre o'er unclouded skies. 'Twas silence allâsave, where along the road The slow wain grating bore its cumb'rous load; Save, where broad rivers roll'd their waves away, And screaming herons sought their watry preyâ When hapless Damon, in Algorno's vale, Pour'd his soft sorrows on the passing gale. âThat grace of shape, that elegance of air, âThat blooming face so exquisitely fair; âThat eye of brightness bright as morning's ray, âThat smile of softness soft as closing day, âWhich bound my soul to thee; all, all are fledâ âAll lost in dreary mansions of the dead! âEv'n him, whom distance from his Love divides, âToil'd on scorch'd sands, or tost on rolling tides, âKind Hope still chears, still paints, to sooth his pain, âThe happy moment when they meet again. âFar worse my lot! of Hope bereft, I mourn!â âThe parted spirit never can return!â Thus Damon spoke, as in the cypress gloom He hung lamenting o'er his Delia's tomb. In the still valley where they wander'd near, Two gentle Shepherds chanc'd his voice to hear: Lycoron's head Time's hand had silver'd o'er, And Milo's cheek Youth's rosy blushes bore. âHow mournful,â said Lycoron, âflows that strain! âIt brings past miseries to my mind again. âWhen the blithe Village, on the vernal green, âSees its fair Daughters in the dance convene; âAnd Youth's light step in search of Pleasure strays, âAnd his fond eyes on Beauty fix their gaze; âShouldst thou then, lingering midst the lovely train, âWish some young Charmer's easy heart to gain, âMark well, that Reason Love's pursuit approve, âEre thy soft arts her tender passions move: âElse, tho' thy thoughts in Summer regions range, âCalm sunny climes that seem to fear no change; âRude Winter's rage will soon the scene deform, âDark with thick cloud, and rough with battering storm!â âWhen parents interdict, and friends dissuade, âThe prudent censure, and the proud upbraid; âThink! all their efforts then shalt thou disdain, âThy faith, thy constancy, unmov'd, maintain? âTo Isca's fields, me once Ill-fortune led; âIn Isca's fields, her flocks Zelinda fed: âThere oft, when Ev'ning, on the silent plain, âCommenc'd with sweet serenity her reign, âAlong green groves, or down the winding dales, âThe Fair-one listen'd to my tender tales; âThen when her mind, or doubt, or fear, distrest, âAnd doubt, or fear, her anxious eyes exprest, âO no!â said I, âlet oxen quit the mead, âWith climbing goats on craggy cliffs to feed; âBefore the hare the hound affrighted fly, âAnd larks pursue the falcon through the sky; âStreams cease to flow, and winds to stir the lake, âIf I, unfaithful, ever thee forsake!ââ âWhat my tongue utter'd then, my heart believ'd: âO wretched heart, self-flatter'd and deceiv'd! âFell Slander's arts the Virgin's fame accus'd; âAnd whom my love had chose, my pride refus'd. âFor me, that cheek did tears of grief distain? âTo me, that voice in anguish plead in vain? âWhat fiend relentless then my soul possest? âOblivion hide! for ever hide the rest! âToo well her innocence and truth were prov'd; âToo late my pity and my justice mov'd! He ceas'd, with groans that more than words exprest; And smote in agony his aged breast. His friend reply'd not; but, with soothing strains Of solemn music, sought to ease his pains: Soft flow'd the notes, as gales that waft perfume From cowslip meads, or linden boughs in bloom. Peace o'er their minds a calm composure cast; And slowly down the shadowy vale in pensive mood they past. ELEGY I. Written at the Approach of Spring. Stern Winter hence with all his train removes, And cheerful skies and limpid streams are seen; Thick-sprouting foliage decorates the groves; Reviving herbage clothes the fields with green. Yet lovelier scenes th' approaching months prepare; Kind Spring's full bounty soon will be display'd; The smile of beauty ev'ry vale shall wear; The voice of song enliven ev'ry shade. O Fancy, paint not coming days too fair! Oft for the prospects sprightly May should yield, Rain-pouring clouds have darken'd all the air, Or snows untimely whiten'd o'er the field: But should kind Spring her wonted bounty show'r, The smile of beauty, and the voice of song; If gloomy thought the human mind o'erpow'r, Ev'n vernal hours glide unenjoy'd along. I shun the scenes where madd'ning passion raves, Where Pride and Folly high dominion hold, And unrelenting Avarice drives her slaves O'er prostrate Virtue in pursuit of gold. The grassy lane, the wood-surrounded field, The rude stone fence with fragrant wall-flow'rs gay, The clay-built cot, to me more pleasure yield Than all the pomp imperial domes display: And yet even here, amid these secret shades, These simple scenes of unreprov'd delight, Affliction's iron hand my breast invades, And Death's dread dart is ever in my sight. While genial suns to genial show'rs succeed, (The air all mildness, and the earth all bloom); While herds and flocks range sportive o'er the mead, Crop the sweet herb, and snuff the rich perfume; O why alone to hapless man deny'd To taste the bliss inferior beings boast? O why this fate, that fear and pain divide His few short hours on earth's delightful coast? Ah ceaseâno more of Providence complain! 'Tis sense of guilt that wakes the mind to woe, Gives force to fear, adds energy to pain, And palls each joy by Heav'n indulg'd below: Why else the smiling infant-train so blest, Ere ill propension ripens into sin, Ere wild desire inflames the youthful breast, And dear-bought knowledge ends the peace within? As to the bleating tenants of the field, As to the sportive warblers on the trees, To them their joys sincere the seasons yield, And all their days and all their prospects please; Such mine, when first, from London's crowded streets, Rov'd my young steps to Surry's wood-crown'd hills, O'er new-blown meads that breath'd a thousand sweets, By shady coverts and by chrystal rills. O happy hours, beyond recov'ry fled! What share I now that can your loss repay, While o'er my mind these glooms of thought are spread, And veil the light of life's meridian ray? Is there no Power this darkness to remove? The long-lost joys of Eden to restore? Or raise our views to happier seats above, Where fear and pain and death shall be no more? Yes, those there are who know a Saviour's love The long-lost joys of Eden can restore, And raise their views to happier seats above, Where fear and pain and death shall be no more: These grateful share the gifts of Nature's hand; And in the varied scenes that round them shine (Minute and beautiful, or rude and grand), Admire th' amazing workmanship divine. Blows not a flow'ret in th' enamel'd vale, Shines not a pebble where the riv'let strays, Sports not an insect on the spicy gale, But claims their wonder and excites their praise. For them ev'n vernal Nature looks more gay, For them more lively hues the fields adorn; To them more fair the fairest smile of Day, To them more sweet the sweetest breath of Morn. They feel the bliss that Hope and Faith supply; They pass serene th' appointed hours that bring The Day that wafts them to the realms on high, The Day that centers in Eternal Spring. ELEGY II. Written in the Hot Weather, July, 1757. Three hours from noon the passing shadow shows, The sultry breeze glides faintly o'er the plains, The dazzling Ether fierce and fiercer glows, And human nature scarce its rage sustains. Now still and vacant is the dusty street, And still and vacant all yon fields extend, Save where those swains, oppress'd with toil and heat, The grassy harvest of the mead attend. Lost is the lively aspect of the ground, Low are the springs, the reedy ditches dry; No verdant spot in all the vale is found, Save what yon stream's unfailing stores supply. Where are the flow'rs, the garden's rich array? Where is their beauty, where their fragrance fled? Their stems relax, fast fall their leaves away, They fade and mingle with their dusty bed: All but the natives of the torrid zone, What Afric's wilds, or Peru's fields display, Pleas'd with a clime that imitates their own, They lovelier bloom beneath the parching ray. Where is wild Nature's heart-reviving song, That fill'd in genial spring the verdant bow'rs? Silent in gloomy woods the feather'd throng Pine thro' this long, long course of sultry hours. Where is the dream of bliss by Summer brought? The walk along the riv'let-water'd vale? The field with verdure clad, with fragrance fraught? The sun mild-beaming, and the fanning gale? The weary soul Imagination chears, Her pleasing colours paint the future gay: Time passes on, the truth itself appears, The pleasing colours instant fade away. In diff'rent seasons diff'rent joys we place, And these will Spring supply, and Summer these; Yet frequent storms the bloom of Spring deface, And Summer scarcely brings a day to please. O for some secret shady cool recess, Some Gothic dome o'erhung with darksome trees, Where thick damp walls this raging heat repress, Where the long aisle invites the lazy breeze! But why these plaints?âreflect, nor murmur moreâ Far worse their fate in many a foreign land, The Indian tribes on Darien's swampy shore The Arabs wand'ring over Mecca's sand. Far worse, alas! the feeling mind sustains, Rack'd with the poignant pangs of fear or shame; The hopeless lover bound in Beauty's chains, The bard whom Envy robs of hard-earn'd fame; He, who a father or a mother mourns, Or lovely consort lost in early bloom; He, whom fell Febris, rapid Fury! burns, Or Phthisis flow leads ling'ring to the tombâ Lest Man should sink beneath the present pain; Lest Man should triumph in the present joy; For him th' unvarying laws of Heav'n ordain, Hope in his ills, and to his bliss alloy. Fierce and oppressive is the heat we bear, Yet not unuseful to our humid soil; Thence shall our fruits a richer flavour share, Thence shall our plains with riper harvests smile. Reflect, nor murmur moreâfor, good in all, Heaven gives the due degrees of drought or rain; Perhaps ere morn refreshing show'rs may fall, Nor soon yon sun rise blazing fierce again: Ev'n now behold the grateful change at hand! Hark, in the East loud blust'ring gales arise; Wide and more wide the dark'ning clouds expand, And distant lightnings flash along the skies! O, in the awful concert of the storm, While hail and rain and wind and thunder join; May deep-felt gratitude my soul inform, May joyful songs of rev'rent praise be mine! ELEGY III. Written in Harvest. Farewell the pleasant violet-scented shade, The primros'd hill, and daisy-mantled mead; The furrow'd land, with springing corn array'd; The sunny wall, with bloomy branches spread: Farewell the bow'r with blushing roses gay; Farewell the fragrant trefoil-purpled field; Farewell the walk through rows of new-mown hay, When ev'ning breezes mingled odours yield: Of these no moreânow round the lonely farms, Where jocund Plenty deigns to fix her seat; Th' autumnal landscape op'ning all its charms, Declares kind Nature's annual work complete. In diff'rent parts what diff'rent views delight, Where on neat ridges waves the golden grain; Or where the bearded barley dazzling white, Spreads o'er the steepy slope or wide champaign. The smile of Morning gleams along the hills, And wakeful Labour calls her sons abroad; They leave with chearful look their lowly vills, And bid the fields resign their ripen'd load. In various tasks engage the rustic bands, And here the scythe, and there the sickle wield; Or rear the new-bound sheaves along the lands, Or range in heaps the swarths upon the field. Some build the shocks, some load the spacious wains, Some lead to shelt'ring barns the fragrant corn; Some form tall ricks, that tow'ring o'er the plains For many a mile, the homestead yards adorn.â The rattling car with verdant branches crown'd, The joyful swains that raise the clam'rous song, Th' inclosure gates thrown open all around, The stubble peopled by the gleaning throng, Soon mark glad harvest o'erâYe rural Lords, Whose wide domains o'er Albion's isle extend; Think whose kind hand your annual wealth affords, And bid to Heaven your grateful praise ascend! For tho' no gift spontaneous of the ground Rose these fair crops that made your vallies smile, Tho' the blithe youth of every hamlet round Pursued for these thro' many a day their toil; Yet what avail your labours or your cares? Can all your labours, all your cares, supply Bright suns, or soft'ning show'rs, or tepid airs, Or one indulgent influence of the sky? For Providence decrees, that we obtain With toil each blessing destin'd to our use; But means to teach us, that our toil is vain If He the bounty of his hand refuse. Yet, Albion, blame not what thy crime demands, While this sad truth the blushing Muse betraysâ More frequent echoes o'er thy harvest lands, The voice of Riot than the voice of Praise. Prolific tho' thy fields, and mild thy clime, Realms fam'd for fields as rich, for climes as fair, Have fall'n the prey of Famine, War, and Time, And now no semblance of their glory bear. Ask Palestine, proud Asia's early boast, Where now the groves that pour'd her wine and oil; Where the fair towns that crown'd her wealthy coast; Where the glad swains that till'd her fertile soil: Ask, and behold, and mourn her hapless fall! Where rose fair towns, where toil'd the jocund swain, Thron'd on the naked rock and mould'ring wall, Pale Want and Ruin hold their dreary reign. Where Jordan's vallies smil'd in living green, Where Sharon's flow'rs disclos'd their varied hues, The wand'ring pilgrim views the alter'd scene, And drops the tear of pity as he views. Ask Grecia, mourning o'er her ruin'd tow'rs; Where now the prospects charm'd her bards of old, Her corn-clad mountains and Elysian bow'rs, And silver streams thro' fragrant meadows roll'd. Where Freedom's praise along the vale was heard, And town to town return'd the fav'rite sound; Where Patriot War her awful standard rear'd, And brav'd the millions Persia pour'd around: There Freedom's praise no more the valley chears, There Patriot War no more her banner waves; Nor bard, nor sage, nor martial chief appears, But stern barbarians rule a land of slaves. Of mighty realms are such the poor remains? Of mighty realms that fell, when mad with pow'r, They call'd for Vice to revel on their plains; The monster doom'd their offspring to devour! O Albion! wouldst thou shun their mournful fate, To shun their follies and their crimes be thine; And woo to linger in thy fair retreat, The radiant Virtues, progeny divine! Fair Truth, with dauntless eye and aspect bland; Sweet Peace, whose brow no angry frown deforms; Soft Charity, with ever-open hand; And Courage, calm amid surrounding storms. O lovely Train! O haste to grace our Isle! So may the Pow'r who ev'ry blessing yields, Bid on her clime serenest seasons smile, And crown with annual wealth her far-fam'd fields. ELEGY IV. Written at the Approach of Winter. The Sun far southward bends his annual way, The bleak North-east Wind lays the forests bare, The fruit ungather'd quits the naked spray, And dreary Winter reigns o'er earth and air. No mark of vegetable life is seen, No bird to bird repeats his tuneful call; Save the dark leaves of some rude evergreen, Save the lone red-breast on the moss-grown wall. Where are the sprightly prospects Spring supply'd, The may-flower'd hedges scenting every breeze; The white flocks scatt'ring o'er the mountain's side, The woodlarks warbling on the blooming trees? Where is gay Summer's sportive insect train, That in green fields on painted pinions play'd? The herd at morn wide-pasturing o'er the plain, Or throng'd at noon-tide in the willow shade? Where is brown Autumn's ev'ning mild and still, What time the ripen'd corn fresh fragrance yields, What time the village peoples all the hill, And loud shouts echo o'er the harvest fields? To former scenes our fancy thus returns, To former scenes that little pleas'd when here! Our Winter chills us, and our Summer burns, Yet we dislike the changes of the year. To happier lands then restless Fancy flies, Where Indian streams thro' green Savannahs flow; Where brighter suns and ever tranquil skies Bid new fruits ripen, and new flow'rets blow. Let Truth these fairer happier lands surveyâ There frowning Months descend in wat'ry storms; Or Nature saints amid the blaze of day, And one brown hue the sun-burnt plain deforms. There oft, as toiling in the sultry fields, Or homeward passing on the shadeless way, His joyless life the weary lab'rer yields, And instant drops beneath the deathful ray. Who dreams of Nature, free from Nature's strife? Who dreams of constant happiness below? The hope-flush'd ent'rer on the stage of life; The youth to knowledge unchastis'd by woe. For me, long toil'd on many a weary road, Led by false Hope in search of many a joy; I find in Earth's bleak clime no blest abode, No place, no season, sacred from annoy: For me, while Winter rages round the plains, With his dark days I human life compare; Not those more fraught with clouds and winds and rains Than this with pining pain and anxious care. O! whence this wond'rous turn of mind our fateâ Whate'er the season or the place possest, We ever murmur at our present state; And yet the thought of parting breaks our rest? Why else, when heard in Ev'ning's solemn gloom, Does the sad knell, that sounding o'er the plain Tolls some poor lifeless body to the tomb, Thus thrill my breast with melancholy pain? The voice of Reason thunders in my ear: âThus thou, ere long, must join thy kindred clay; âNo more those nostrils breathe the vital air, âNo more those eyelids open on the day!ââ O Winter, o'er me hold thy dreary reign! Spread wide thy skies in darkest horrors drest! Of their dread rage no longer I'll complain, Nor ask an Eden for a transient guest. Enough has Heaven indulg'd of joy below, To tempt our tarriance in this lov'd retreat; Enough has Heaven ordain'd of useful woe, To make us languish for a happier seat. There is, who deems all climes, all seasons fair; There is, who knows no restless passion's strife; Contentment, smiling at each idle care; Contentment, thankful for the gift of life! She finds in Winter many a view to please; The morning landscape fring'd with frost-work gay, The sun at noon seen thro' the leafless trees, The clear calm ether at the close of day: She marks th' advantage storms and clouds bestow, When blust'ring Caurus purifies the air; When moist Aquarius pours the fleecy snow, That makes th' impregnate glebe a richer harvest bear: She bids, for all, our grateful praise arise, To Him whose mandate spake the world to form; Gave Spring's gay bloom, and Summer's chearful skies, And Autumn's corn-clad field, and Winter's sounding storm. ELEGY; WRITTEN AT AMWELL IN HERTFORDSHIRE, MDCCLXVIII. O friend! though silent thus thy tongue remains, I read enquiry in thy anxious eye, Why my pale cheek the frequent tear distains, Why from my bosom bursts the frequent sigh. Long from these scenes detain'd in distant fields, My mournful tale perchance escap'd thy ear: Fresh grief to me the repetition yields; Thy kind attention gives thee right to hear! Foe to the world's pursuit of wealth and fame, Thy Theron early from the world retir'd, Left to the busy throng each boasted aim, Nor aught, save peace in solitude, desir'd. A few choice volumes there could oft engage, A few choice friends there oft amus'd the day; There his lov'd Parents' slow-declining age, Life's calm unvary'd ev'ning, wore away. Foe to the futile manners of the proud, He chose an humble Virgin for his own; A form with Nature's fairest gifts endow'd, And pure as vernal blossoms newly blown: Her hand she gave, and with it gave a heart By love engag'd, with gratitude imprest, Free without folly, prudent without art, With wit accomplish'd, and with virtue blest. Swift pass'd the hours; alas, to pass no more! Flown like the light clouds of a summer's day! One beauteous pledge the beauteous consort bore; The fatal gift forbad the giver's stay. Ere twice the Sun perform'd his annual round, In one sad spot where kindred ashes lie, O'er wife, and child, and parents, clos'd the ground; The final home of Man ordain'd to die! O cease at length, obtrusive Mem'ry! cease, Nor in my view the wretched hours retain, That saw Disease on her dear life increase, And Med'cine's lenient arts essay'd in vain. O the dread scene! (in misery how sublime!) Of Love's vain pray'rs to stay her fleeting breath! Suspense that restless watch'd the flight of Time, And helpless dumb Despair awaiting Death! O the dread scene!â'Tis agony to tell, How o'er the couch of pain declin'd my head; And took from dying lips the long farewel, The last, last parting, ere her spirit fled. âRestore her, Heaven, as from the grave retrieveâ âIn each calm moment all things else resign'd, âHer looks, her language, show how hard to leave âThe lov'd companion she must leave behind. âRestore her, Heaven! for once in mercy spareââ Thus Love's vain prayer in anguish interpos'd: And soon Suspense gave place to dumb Despair, And o'er the past, Death's sable curtain clos'dââ In silence clos'dâMy thoughts rov'd frantic round, No hope, no wish, beneath the sun remain'd; Earth, air, and skies one dismal waste I found, One pale, dead, dreary blank, with horror stain'd. O lovely flow'r, too fair for this rude clime! O lovely morn, too prodigal of light! O transient beauties, blasted in their prime! O transient glories, sunk in sudden night! Sweet Excellence, by all who knew thee mourn'd! Where is that form, that mind, my soul admir'd; That form, with every pleasing charm adorn'd; That mind, with every gentle thought inspir'd? The face with rapture view'd, I view no more; The voice with rapture heard, no more I hear: Yet the lov'd features Mem'ry's eyes explore; Yet the lov'd accents fall on Mem'ry's ear. Ah sad, sad change! (sad source of daily pain) That sense of loss ineffable renews; While my rack'd bosom heaves the sigh in vain, While my pale cheek the tear in vain bedews. Still o'er the grave that holds the dear remains, The mould'ring veil her spirit left below, Fond Fancy dwells, and pours funereal strains, The soul-dissolving melody of woe. Nor mine alone to bear this painful doom, Nor she alone the tear of Song obtains; The Muse of Blagdon See Verses written at Sandgate Castle, in memory of a Lady, by the late ingenious Dr. Langhorne., o'er Constantia's tomb, In all the eloquence of grief complains. My friend's fair hope, like mine, so lately gain'd; His heart, like mine, in its true partner blest; Both from one cause the same distress sustain'd, The same sad hours beheld us both distrest. O Human Life! how mutable, how vain! How thy wide sorrows circumscribe thy joyâ A sunny island in a stormy main, A spot of azure in a cloudy sky! All-gracious Heaven! since Man, infatuate Man, Rests in thy works, too negligent of thee, Lays for himself on earth his little plan, Dreads not, or distant views mortality; 'Tis but to wake to nobler thought the soul, To rouse us ling'ring on earth's flowery plain, To Virtue's path our wand'rings to controul, Affliction frowning comes, thy minister of pain! AMWELL: A DESCRIPTIVE POEM. There dwells a fond desire in human minds, When pleas'd, their pleasure to extend to those Of kindred taste; and thence th' inchanting arts Of Picture and of Song, the semblance fair Of Nature's forms produce. This fond desire Prompts me to sing the lonely sylvan scenes Of Amwell; which, so oft in early youth, While novelty enhanc'd their native charms, Gave rapture to my soul; and often, still, On life's calm moments shed serener joy.

And Thou, by strong connubial union mine; Mine, by the stronger union of the heart; In whom the loss of parents and of friends, And Her, the first fair partner of my joys, All recompens'd I find; whose presence chears The soft domestic scene; Maria, come! The Country calls us forth; blithe Summer's hand Sheds sweetest flowers, and Morning's brightest smile Illumines earth and air; Maria, come! By winding pathways thro' the waving corn, We reach the airy point that prospect yields, Not vast and awful, but confin'd and fair; Not the black mountain and the foamy main; Not the throng'd city and the busy port; But pleasant interchange of soft ascent, And level plain, and growth of shady woods, And twining course of rivers clear, and sight Of rural towns and rural cots, whose roofs Rise scattering round, and animate the whole. Far tow'rds the west, close under sheltering hills, In verdant meads, by Lee's cerulean stream, Hertford's grey towers In the beginning of the Heptarchy, the town of Hertford was accounted one of the principal cities of the East Saxons, where the kings of that province often kept their courts, and a parliamentary council, or national synod, was held, Sept. 24th, 673.

For War there once, so tells th' historic page, Led Desolation's steps: the hardy Dane, By Avarice lur'd, o'er Ocean's stormy wave, To ravage Albion's plains, his favourite seat, There fix'd awhile; and there his castles rear'd Among the trees; and there, beneath yon ridge Of piny rocks, his conquering navy moor'd, With idle sails furl'd on the yard, and oars Recumbent on the flood, and streamers gay Triumphant fluttering on the passing winds. In fear, the shepherd on the lonely heath Tended his scanty flock; the ploughman turn'd, In fear, his hasty furrow: oft the din Of hostile arms alarm'd the ear, and flames Of plunder'd towns thro' night's thick gloom from far Gleam'd dismal on the sight: till Alfred came, Till Alfred, father of his people, came, Lee's rapid tide into new channels turn'd, And left a-ground the Danian fleet, and forc'd The foe to speedy flight Towards the latter end of the year 879, the Danes advanced to the borders of Mercia, and erected two forts at Hertford on the Lee, for the security of their ships, which they had brought up that river. Here they were attacked by the Londoners, who were repulsed. But Alfred advancing with his army, and viewing the nature of their situation, turned the course of the stream, so that their vessels were left on dry ground; a circumstance which terrified them to such a degree, that they abandoned their forts, and, flying towards the Severn, were pursued by Alfred as far as Quatbridge.

Margaret, Countess of Leicester, and Lady of the Manor, founded a priory for friers in the north part of this town of Ware, and dedicated the same to St. Francis.â Chauncy's Hertfordshire., and shows In its clear mirrour Ware's inverted roofs. Ware once was known to Fame; to her fair fields Whilom the Gothic tournament's proud pomp Brought Albion's valiant youth and blooming maids: Pleas'd with ideas of the past, the Muse Bids Fancy's pencil paint the scene, where they In gilded barges on the glassy stream Circled the reedy isles, the sportive dance Along the smooth lawn led, or in the groves Wander'd conversing, or reclin'd at ease To harmony of lutes and voices sweet Resign'd the enchanted ear; till sudden heard The silver trumpet's animating sound Summon'd the champions forth; on stately steeds, In splendid armour clad, the ponderous lance With strenuous hand sustaining, forth they came. Where gay pavilions rose upon the plain, Or azure awnings stretch'd from tree to tree, Mix'd with thick foliage, form'd a mimic sky Of grateful shade (as oft in Agra's streets The silken canopy from side to side Extends to break the sun's impetuous ray, While monarchs pass beneath); there sat the Fair, A glittering train on costly carpets rang'd, A group of beauties all in youthful prime, Of various feature and of various grace! The pensive languish, and the sprightly air, The engaging smile, and all the nameless charms Which transient hope, or fear, or grief, or joy, Wak'd in th' expressive eye, th' enamour'd heart Of each young hero rous'd to daring deeds. Nor this aught strange, that those whom love inspir'd Prov'd ev'ry means the lovely sex to please: This strange, indeed, how custom thus could teach The tender breast complacence in the sight Of barb'rous sport, where friend from hand of friend The fatal wound full oft receiv'd, and fell A victim to false glory; as that day Fell gallant Pembroke, while his pompous show Ended in silent gloom âIn the 25th of Henry III. on the 27th of June, Gilbert Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, a potent Peer of the Realm, proclaimed here [at Ware] a disport of running on horseback with lances, which was then called a tournament.â Chauncy's Hist. of Hertfordshire. âAt this tournament, the said Gilbert was slain by a fall from his horse; Robert de Say, one of his knights, was killed, and several others wounded.â Smollet's Hist. of England.. One pitying tear To human frailty paid; my roving sight Pursues its pleasing course o'er neighb'ring hills, Where frequent hedge-rows intersect rich fields Of many a different form and different hue, Bright with ripe corn, or green with grass, or dark With clover's purple bloom; o'er Widbury's mount With that fair crescent crown'd of lofty elms, Its own peculiar boast; and o'er the woods That round immure the deep sequester'd dale Of Langley This delightful retreat, commonly called Langley-bottom, is situated about half a mile from Ware, and the same distance from Amwell. The scene is adapted to contemplation, and possesses such capabilities of improvement, that the genius of a Shenstone might easily convert it to a second Leasowes. The transition from this solitude to Widbury-Hill, is made in a walk of a few minutes, and the prospect from that hill, in a fine evening, is beautiful beyond description., down whose flow'r-embroider'd meads Swift Ash thro' pebbly shores meandering rolls. Elysian scene! as from the living world Secluded quite; for of that world, to him Whose wanderings trace thy winding length, appears No mark, save one white solitary spire At distance rising thro' the tufted treesâ Elysian scene! recluse as that, so fam'd For solitude, by Warwick's ancient walls, Where under umbrage of the mossy cliff Victorious Guy, so legends say, reclin'd His hoary head beside the silver stream, In meditation raptââElysian scene! At evening often, while the setting sun On the green summit of thy eastern groves Pour'd full his yellow radiance; while the voice Of Zephyr whispering midst the rustling leaves, The sound of water murmuring thro' the sedge, The turtle's plaintive call, and music soft Of distant bells, whose ever varying notes In slow sad measure mov'd, combin'd to sooth The soul to sweet solemnity of thought; Beneath thy branchy bowers of thickest gloom, Much on the imperfect state of Man I have mus'd: How Pain o'er half his hours her iron reign Ruthless extends; how Pleasure from the path Of Innocence allures his steps; how Hope Directs his eye to distant Joy, that flies His fond pursuit; how Fear his shuddering heart Alarms with fancy'd ill; how Doubt and Care Perplex his thought; how soon the tender rose Of Beauty fades, the sturdy oak of Strength Declines to earth, and over all our pride Stern Time triumphant stands. From general fate To private woes then oft has Memory pass'd, And mourn'd the loss of many a friend belov'd; Of thee, De Horne, kind, generous, wise, and good! And thee, my Turner, who in vacant youth, Here oft in converse free, or studious search Of classic lore, accompanied my walk! From Ware's green bowers, to Devon's myrtle vales, Remov'd a while, with prospect opening fair Of useful life and honour in his view; As falls the vernal bloom before the breath Of blasting Eurus, immature he fell! The tidings reach'd my ear, and in my breast, Aching with recent wounds See Elegy written at Amwell, 1768, p. 49., new anguish wak'd. When melancholy thus has chang'd to grief, That grief in soft forgetfulness to lose, I have left the gloom for gayer scenes, and sought Thro' winding paths of venerable shade, The airy brow where that tall spreading beech O'er-tops surrounding groves, up rocky steeps, Tree over tree dispos'd; or stretching far Their shadowy coverts down th' indented side Of fair corn-fields; or pierc'd with sunny glades, That yield the casual glimpse of flowery meads And shining silver rills; on these the eye Then wont to expatiate pleas'd; or more remote Survey'd yon vale of Lee, in verdant length Of level lawn spread out to Kent's blue hills, And the proud range of glitt'ring spires that rise In misty air on Thames's crowded shores. How beautiful, how various, is the view Of these sweet pastoral landscapes! fair, perhaps, As those renown'd of old, from Tabor's height, Or Carmel seen; or those, the pride of Greece, TempÃ¨ or Arcady; or those that grac'd The banks of clear Elorus, or the skirts Of thymy Hybla, where Sicilia's isle Smiles on the azure main; there once was heard The Muse's lofty lay.âHow beautiful, How various is yon view! delicious hills Bounding smooth vales, smooth vales by winding streams Divided, that here glide thro' grassy banks In open sun, there wander under shade Of aspen tall, or ancient elm, whose boughs O'erhang grey castles, and romantic farms, And humble cots of happy shepherd swains. Delightful habitations! with the song Of birds melodious charm'd, and bleat of flocks From upland pastures heard, and low of kine Grazing the rushy mead, and mingled sounds Of falling waters and of whisp'ring windsâ Delightful habitations! o'er the land Dispers'd around, from Waltham's osier'd isles To where bleak Nasing's lonely tower o'erlooks Her verdant fields; from Raydon's pleasant groves And Hunsdon's bowers on Stort's irriguous marge, By Rhye's old walls, to Hodsdon's airy street; From Haly's woodland to the flow'ry meads Of willow-shaded Stansted, and the slope Of Amwell's Mount, that crown'd with yellow corn There from the green flat, softly swelling, shows Like some bright vernal cloud by Zephyr's breath Just rais'd above the horizon's azure bound. As one long travell'd on Italia's plains, The land of pomp and beauty, still his feet On his own Albion joys to fix again; So my pleas'd eye, which o'er the prospect wide Has wander'd round, and various objects mark'd, On Amwell rests at last, its favourite scene! How picturesque the view! where up the side Of that steep bank, her roofs of russet thatch Rise mix'd with trees, above whose swelling tops Ascends the tall church tow'r, and loftier still The hill's extended ridge. How picturesque! Where slow beneath that bank the silver stream Glides by the flowery isle, and willow groves Wave on its northern verge, with trembling tufts Of osier intermix'd. How picturesque The slender group of airy elm, the clump Of pollard oak, or ash, with ivy brown Entwin'd; the walnut's gloomy breadth of boughs, The orchard's ancient fence of rugged pales, The haystack's dusky cone, the moss-grown shed, The clay-built barn; the elder-shaded cot, Whose white-wash'd gable prominent thro' green Of waving branches shows, perchance inscrib'd With some past owner's name, or rudely grac'd With rustic dial, that scarcely serves to mark Time's ceaseless flight; the wall with mantling vines O'erspread, the porch with climbing woodbine wreath'd, And under sheltering eves the sunny bench Where brown hives range, whose busy tenants fill, With drowsy hum, the little garden gay, Whence blooming beans, and spicy herbs, and flowers, Exhale around a rich perfume! Here rests The empty wain; there idle lies the plough: By Summer's hand unharness'd, here the steed, Short ease enjoying, crops the daisied lawn; Here bleats the nursling lamb, the heifer there Waits at the yard-gate lowing. By the road, Where the neat ale-house stands (so once stood thine, Deserted Auburn! in immortal song Consign'd to Fame See The Deserted Village, a beautiful poem, by the late Dr. Goldsmith.), the cottage sire recounts The praise he earn'd, when cross the field he drew The straightest furrow, or neatest built the rick, Or led the reaper band in sultry noons With unabating strength, or won the prize At many a crowded wake. Beside her door, The cottage matron whirls her circling wheel, And jocund chants her lay. The cottage maid Feeds from her loaded lap her mingled train Of clamorous hungry fowls; or o'er the style Leaning with downcast look, the artless tale Of evening courtship hears. The sportive troop Of cottage children on the grassy waste Mix in rude gambols, or the bounding ball Circle from hand to hand, or rustic notes Wake on their pipes of jointed reed: while near The careful shepherd's frequent-falling strokes Fix on the fallow lea his hurdled fold. Such rural life! so calm, it little yields Of interesting act, to swell the page Of history or song; yet much the soul Its sweet simplicity delights, and oft From noise of busy towns, to fields and groves, The Muse's sons have fled to find repose. Fam'd Walton Isaac Walton, author of The Complete Angler, an ingenious biographer, and no despicable poet. The scene of his Anglers' Dialogues, is the Vale of Lee, between Tottenham and Ware; it seems to have been a place he much frequented: he particularly mentions Amwell-hill., erst, the ingenious fisher swain, Oft our fair haunts explor'd; upon Lee's shore, Beneath some green tree oft his angle laid, His sport suspending to admire their charms. He, who in verse his Country's story told William Warner, author of Albion's England, an Historical Poem; an episode of which, intitled Argentile and Curan, has been frequently reprinted, and is much admired by the lovers of old English Poetry. The ingenious Dr. Percy, who has inserted this piece in his Collection, observes that, âthough Warner's name is so seldom mentioned, his contemporaries ranked him on a level with Spenser, and called them the Homer and Virgil of their age;â that âWarner was said to have been a Warwickshire man, and to have been educated at Magdalen Hall; that, in the latter part of his life, he was retained in the service of Henry Cary, Lord Hunsdon, to whom he dedicates his poem; but that more of his history is not known.â Mrs. Cooper, in her Muses' Library, after highly applauding his poetry, adds, âWhat were the circumstances and accidents of his life, we have hardly light enough to conjecture; any more than, by his dedication, it appears he was in the service of the Lord Hunsdon, and acknowledges very gratefully both father and son for his patrons and benefactors.ââBy the following extract from the Parish Register of Amwell, it may be reasonably concluded, that Warner resided for some time at that village; and, as his profession of an attorney is particularly mentioned, it is pretty evident, that, whatever dependence he might have on Lord Hunsdon, it could not be in the capacity of a menial servant. Though Warner's merit, as a poet, may have been too highly rated, it was really not inconsiderable; his Argentile and Curan has many beauties; but it has also the faults common to the compositions of his age, especially a most disgusting indelicacy of sentiment and expression. âMa. William Warner, a man of good yeares and honest reputation, by his profession an Atturney at the Common Please, Author of Albion's England; dying soddenly in the night in his bedde, without any former complaynt or sicknesse, on Thursday night beeing the 9th of March, was buried the Saturday following, and lieth in the church at the upper end, under the stone of Gwalter Fader.â Parish Register of Amwell, 1608-9., Here dwelt awhile; perchance here sketch'd the scene, Where his fair Argentile, from crowded courts For pride self-banish'd, in sequester'd shades Sojourn'd disguis'd, and met the slighted youth Who long had sought her loveâthe gentle bard Sleeps here, by Fame forgotten; (fickle Fame Too oft forgets her favourites!) By his side Sleeps gentle Hassal Thomas Hassal, vicar of Amwell; he kept the above-mentioned Parish Register with uncommon care and precision, enriching it with many entertaining anecdotes of the parties registered. He performed his duty in the most hazardous circumstances, it appearing that the plague twice raged in the village during his residence there; in 1603 when 26 persons, and in 1625 when 22 persons died of it, and were buried in his church-yard. The character here given of him must be allowed, strictly speaking, to be imaginary; but his composition, in the said register, appeared to me to breathe such a spirit of piety, simplicity, and benevolence, that I almost think myself authorised to assert that it was his real one. He himself is registered by his son Edmund Hassal, as follows: âThomas Hassal, Vicar of this parish, where he had continued resident 57 years 7 months and 16 days, in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles, departed this life September 24th, Thursday, and was buried September 26th, Saturday. His body was laid in the chancel of this church, under the priests or marble stone. Ãtatis 84. Non erat ante, nec erit post te similis. Edmund Hassal.â Register of Amwell, 1657. Elizabeth Hassal, wife of the said Thomas Hassal, died about the same time, aged 78 years 8 months, married 46 years and 4 months., who with tenderest care Here watch'd his village charge; in nuptial bonds Their hands oft join'd; oft heard, and oft reliev'd Their little wants; oft heard and oft compos'd, Sole arbiter, their little broils; oft urg'd Their flight from folly and from vice; and oft Dropt on their graves the tear, to early worth Or ancient friendship due. In dangerous days, When Death's fell Fury, pale-eyed Pestilence, Glar'd horror round, his duty he discharg'd Unterrified, unhurt; and here, at length, Clos'd his calm inoffensive useful life In venerable age: her life with him His faithful consort clos'd; on earth's cold breast Both sunk to rest together.âOn the turf, Whence Time's rude grasp has torn their rustic tombs, I strew fresh flowers, and make a moment's pause Of solemn thought; then seek th' adjacent spot, From which, thro' these broad lindens' verdant arch, The steeple's Gothic wall and window dim In perspective appear; then homeward turn By where the Muse, enamour'd of our shades, Deigns still her favouring presence; where my friend, The British Tasso Mr. Hoole, Translator of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered., oft from busy scenes To rural calm and letter'd ease retires. As some fond lover leaves his favourite nymph, Oft looking back, and lingering in her view, So now reluctant this retreat I leave, Look after look indulging; on the right, Up to yon airy battlement's broad top Half veil'd with trees, that, from th' acclivious steep, Jut like the pendent gardens, fam'd of old, Beside Euphrates' bank; then, on the left, Down to those shaded cots, and bright expanse Of water softly sliding by: once, where That bright expanse of water softly slides, O'erhung with shrubs that fring'd the chalky rock, A little fount pour'd forth its gurgling rill, In flinty channel trickling o'er the green, From Emma nam'd; perhaps some sainted maid, For holy life rever'd; to such, erewhile, Fond Superstition many a pleasant grove, And limpid spring, was wont to consecrate. Of Emma's story nought Tradition speaks; Conjecture, who, behind Oblivion's veil, Along the doubtful past delights to stray, Boasts now, indeed, that from her well the place Receiv'd its appellation In Doomsday-book, this village of Amwell is written Emmevelle, perhaps originally Emma's well. When the New River was opened, there was a spring here which was taken into that aqueduct. Chadwell, the other source of that river, evidently received its denomination from the tutelar Saint, St. Chad, who seems to have given name to springs and wells in different parts of England..âThou, sweet Vill, Farewell! and ye, sweet fields, where Plenty's horn Pours liberal boons, and Health propitious deigns Her chearing smile! you not the parching air Of arid sands, you not the vapours chill Of humid fens, annoy; Favonius' wing, From off your thyme-banks and your trefoil meads, Wafts balmy redolence; robust and gay Your swains industrious issue to their toil, Till your rich glebe, or in your granaries store Its generous produce: annual ye resound The ploughman's song, as he thro' reeking soil Guides slow his shining share; ye annual hear The shouts of harvest, and the prattling train Of chearful gleaners:âand th' alternate strokes Of loud flails echoing from your loaded barns, The pallid Morn in dark November wake. But, happy as ye are, in marks of wealth And population; not for these, or aught Beside, wish I, in hyperbolic strains Of vain applause, to elevate your fame Above all other scenes; for scenes as fair Have charm'd my sight, but transient was the view: You, thro' all seasons, in each varied hour For observation happiest, oft my steps Have travers'd o'er; oft Fancy's eye has seen Gay Spring trip lightly on your lovely lawns, To wake fresh flowers at morn; and Summer spread His listless limbs, at noon-tide, on the marge Of smooth translucent pools, where willows green Gave shade, and breezes from the wild mint's bloom Brought odour exquisite; oft Fancy's ear, Deep in the gloom of evening woods, has heard The last sad sigh of Autumn, when his throne To Winter he resign'd; oft Fancy's thought, In extasy, where from the golden east, Or dazzling south, or crimson west, the Sun A different lustre o'er the landscape threw, Some Paradise has form'd, the blissful seat Of Innocence and Beauty! while I wish'd The skill of Claude, or Rubens, or of Him Whom now on Lavant's banks, in groves that breathe Enthusiasm sublime, the Sister Nymphs Painting and Poetry.

AMOEBAEAN ECLOGUES. ECLOGUE I. RURAL SCENERY; or, The Describers. December's frost had bound the fields and streams, And Noon's bright sun effus'd its chearful beams: Where woodland, northward, screen'd a pleasant plain, And on dry fern-banks brouz'd the fleecy train, Two gentle youths, whom rural scenes could please, Both skill'd to frame the tuneful rhyme with ease, Charm'd with the prospect, slowly stray'd along, Themselves amusing with alternate song. FIRST. These pollard oaks their tawny leaves retain, These hardy hornbeams yet unstripp'd remain; The wintry groves all else admit the view Thro' naked stems of many a varied hue. SECOND. Yon shrubby slopes a pleasing mixture show; There the rough elm and smooth white privet grow, Straight shoots of ash with bark of glossy grey, Red cornel twigs, and maple's russet spray. FIRST. These stony steeps with spreading moss abound, Grey on the trees, and green upon the ground; With tangling brambles ivy interweaves, And bright mezerion Mezerion, Laureola Sempervirens: vulg. Spurge-Laurel. This beautiful little evergreen is frequent among our woods and coppices. Its smooth shining leaves are placed on the top of the stems in circular tufts or clusters. Its flowers are small, of a lightgreen, and perfume the air at a distance in an agreeable manner. It blows very early in mild seasons and warm situations. The common deciduous Mezerion, frequently planted in gardens, though very different in appearance, is another species of this genus. spreads its clust'ring leaves. SECOND. Old oaken stubs tough saplings there adorn, There hedge-row plashes yield the knotty thorn; The swain for different uses these avail, And form the traveller's staff, the thresher's flail. FIRST. Where yon brown hazels pendent catkins bear, And prickly furze unfolds its blossoms fair, The vagrant artist oft at ease reclines, And broom's green shoots in besoms neat combines. SECOND. See, down the hill, along the ample glade, The new-fallen wood in even ranges laid! There his keen bill the busy workman plies, And bids in heaps his well-bound faggots rise. FIRST. Soon shall kind Spring her flowery gifts bestow, On sunny banks when silver snowdrops blow, And tufts of primrose all around are spread, And purple violets all their fragrance shed. SECOND. The woods then white anemonies array, And lofty sallows their sweet bloom display, And spicy hyacinths azure bells unfold, And crowfoot clothes the mead with shining gold. FIRST. Then soon gay Summer brings his gaudy train, His crimson poppies deck the corn-clad plain; There scabious blue Scabious: Scabiosa Vulgaris., and purple knapweed Knapweed: Jacea Vulgaris. rise, And weld Weld: Luteola Vulgaris, or Dyers' Weed.âThese plants, with many others not inferior in beauty, are frequent on the balks, or ridges, which separate different kinds of corn in our common fields. and yarrow show their various dyes. SECOND. In shady lanes red foxglove bells appear, And golden spikes the downy mulleins rear The Digitalis, or Foxglove, is a very beautiful plant; there are several varieties of it which are honoured with a place in our gardens. The Mullein is not inferior in beauty, consequently merits equal notice.; Th' inclosure ditch luxuriant mallows hide, And branchy succory crowds the pathway side. FIRST. Th' autumnal fields few pleasing plants supply, Save where pale eyebright grows in pastures dry, Or vervain blue, for magic rites renown'd, And in the village precincts only found It is a vulgar opinion, that Vervain never grows in any place more than a quarter of a mile distant from a house.âVide Miller's Gardener's Dictionary, article Verbena.. SECOND. Th' autumnal hedges withering leaves embrown, Save where wild climbers spread their silvery down Wild Climbers: Clematis, Viorna, or, Traveller's Joy. The white downy seeds of this plant make a very conspicuous figure on our hedges in autumn., And rugged blackthorns bend with purple sloes, And the green skewerwood seeds of scarlet shows Skewerwood: Evonymus; or, Spindle-tree. The twigs of this shrub are of a fine green; the capsules, or seed-vessels, of a fine purple; and the seeds of a rich scarlet. In autumn, when the capsules open and shew the seeds, the plant has a most beautiful appearance.. FIRST. When healthful sallads crown the board in spring, And nymphs green parsley from the gardens bring, Mark well lest hemlock mix its poisonous leavesâ Their semblance oft th' incautious eye deceives. SECOND. Warn, O ye Shepherds! warn the youth who play On hamlet wastes, beside the public way; There oft rank soils pernicious plants produce, There nightshade's berry swells with deadly juice. FIRST. What varied scenes this pleasant country yields, Form'd by th' arrangement fair of woods and fields! On a green hillock, by the shady road, My dwelling standsâa sweet recluse abode! And o'er my darken'd casement intertwine The fragrant briar, the woodbine, and the vine. SECOND. How different scenes our different tastes delight! Some seek the hills, and some the vales invite. Where o'er the brook's moist margin hazels meet, Stands my lone homeâa pleasant, cool retreat! Gay loosestrife there and pale valerian spring Loosestrife: Lysimachia Lutea Vulgaris. Dr. Hill observes, that it is so beautiful a plant, in its erect stature, regular growth, and elegant flowers, that it is every way worthy to be taken into our gardens. It is frequent in moist places. The flowers are of a bright gold colour., And tuneful reed-birds midst the sedges sing. FIRST. Before my door the box-edg'd border lies, Where flowers of mint and thyme and tansy rise; Along my wall the yellow stonecrop grows, And the red houseleek on my brown thatch blows. SECOND. Among green osiers winds my stream away, Where the blue halcyon skims from spray to spray, Where waves the bulrush as the waters glide, And yellow flag-flow'rs deck the sunny side. FIRST. Spread o'er the slope of yon steep western hill, My fruitful orchard shelters all the vill; There pear-trees tall their tops aspiring show, And apple-boughs their branches mix below. SECOND. East from my cottage stretch delightful meads, Where rows of willows rise, and banks of reeds; There roll clear rivers; there, old elms between, The mill's white roof and circling wheels are seen. FIRST. Palemon's garden hawthorn hedges bound, With flow'rs of white, or fruit of crimson, crown'd; There vernal lilacs show their purple bloom, And sweet syringas all the air perfume; The fruitful mulberry spreads its umbrage cool, And the rough quince o'erhangs the little pool. SECOND. Albino's fence green currants hide from view, With bunches hung of red or amber hue; Beside his arbour blows the jasmine fair, And scarlet beans their gaudy blossoms bear; The lofty hollyhock there its spike displays, And the broad sunflow'r shows its golden rays. FIRST. Where moss-grown pales a sunny spot inclos'd, And pinks and lilies all their hues expos'd, Beneath a porch, with mantling vines enwreath'd, The morning breeze the charming Sylvia breath'd: Not pink nor lily with her face could vie, And, O how soft the languish of her eye! I saw and lov'd; but lov'd, alas, in vain! She check'd my passion with severe disdain. SECOND. When o'er the meads with vernal verdure gay The village children wont at eve to stray, I pluck'd fresh flowrets from the grassy ground, And their green stalks with bending rushes bound; My wreaths, my nosegays, then my Delia drest, Crown'd her fair brow, or bloom'd upon her breast. Young as I was, the pleasing thought was mine, One day, fond boy, that beauty will be thine! FIRST. Beside his gate, beneath the lofty tree, Old Thyrsis' well-known seat I vacant see; There, while his prattling offspring round him play'd, He oft to please them toys of osiers made: That seat his weight shall never more sustain, That offspring round him ne'er shall sport again. SECOND. Yon lone church tow'r that overlooks the hills!â The sight my soul full oft with sorrow fills: There Damon lies;âin prime of youth he died!â A ford unknown, by night he vent'rous tried: In vain he struggled with the foaming wave; No friendly arm, alas, was near to save! FIRST. Cease, friend! and, homeward as we bend our way, Remark the beauties of the closing day; See, tow'rds the west, the redd'ning Sun declines, And o'er the fields his level lustre shines. SECOND. How that bright landscape lures the eye to gaze, Where with his beams the distant windows blaze! And the gilt vane, high on the steeple spire, Glows in the airâa dazzling spot of fire! FIRST. Behind yon hill he now forsakes our sight, And yon tall beeches catch his latest light; The hamlet smokes in amber wreaths arise; White mist, like water, on the valley lies. SECOND. Where yon chalk cliffs th' horizon eastward bound, And spreading elms the ancient hall surround, The moon's bright orb arises from the main, And Night in silence holds her solemn reign. ECLOGUE II. RURAL BUSINESS; or, The Agriculturists. May's lib'ral hand her fragrant bloom disclos'd, And herds and flocks on grassy banks repos'd; Soft Evening gave to ease the tranquil hour, And Philomel's wild warblings fill'd the bow'r. Where near the village rose the elm-crown'd hill, And white-leav'd aspins trembled o'er the rill, Three rural Bards, the village youth among, The pleasing lore of rural business sung. FIRST. The care of farms we singâattend the strainâ What skill, what toil, shall best procure you gain; How different culture different ground requires; While Wealth rewards whom Industry inspires. SECOND. When thy light land on scorching gravel lies, And to the springing blade support denies; Fix on the wintry tilth the frequent fold, And mend with cooling marl or untried mould. THIRD. If thy strong loam superfluous wet retain, Lead thro' thy fields the subterraneous drain, And o'er the surface mellowing stores expand Of fiery lime, or incoherent sand. FIRST. In vacant corners, on the hamlet waste, The ample dunghill's steaming heap be plac'd; There many a month fermenting to remain, Ere thy slow team disperse it o'er the plain. SECOND. The prudent farmer all manure provides, The mire of roads, the mould of hedge-row sides; For him their mud the stagnant ponds supply; For him their soil, the stable and the sty. THIRD. For this the swain, on Kennet's winding shore, Digs sulphurous peat along the sable moor; For this, where Ocean bounds the stormy strand, They fetch dank sea-weed to the neighb'ring land. FIRST. Who barren heaths to tillage means to turn, Must, ere he plough, the greensward pare and burn; Where rise the smoking hillocks o'er the field, The saline ashes useful compost yield. SECOND. Where sedge or rushes rise on spongy soils, Or rampant moss th' impoverish'd herbage spoils, Corrosive soot with liberal hand bestow; Th' improving pasture soon its use will show. THIRD. Hertfordian swains on airy hills explore The chalk's white vein, a fertilizing store; This, from deep pits in copious baskets drawn, Amends alike the arable and lawn. FIRST. Who spends too oft in indolence the day, Soon sees his farm his base neglect betray; His useless hedge-greens docks and nettles bear, And the tough cammock clogs his shining share Cammock: Ononis, or Restharrow. The roots of this troublesome plant are so strong, that it is credibly asserted they will stop a plough drawn by several horses.. SECOND. Thy weedy fallows let the plough pervade, Till on the top th' inverted roots are laid; There left to wither in the noon-tide ray, Or by the spiky harrow clear'd away. THIRD. When wheat's green stem the ridge begins to hide, Let the sharp weedhook's frequent aid be tried, Lest thy spoil'd crop at harvest thou bemoan, With twitch and twining bindweed overgrown. FIRST. Much will rank melilot thy grain disgrace, And darnel, fellest of the weedy race: T' extirpate these might care or cost avail, T' extirpate these nor care nor cost should fail. SECOND. When the foul furrow fetid mayweed fills, The weary reaper oft complains of ills; As his keen sickle grides along the lands, The acrid herbage oft corrodes his hands. THIRD. Wield oft thy scythe along the grassy layes, Ere the rude thistle its light down displays; Else that light down upon the breeze will fly, And a new store of noxious plants supply. FIRST. Would ye from tillage ample gains receive, With change of crops th' exhausted soil relieve; Next purple clover let brown wheat be seen, And bearded barley after turnips green. SECOND. Bid here dark peas or tangled vetches spread, There buckwheat's white flow'r faintly ting'd with red; Bid here potatoes deep green stems be born, And yellow cole th' inclosure there adorn. THIRD. Here let tall rye or fragrant beans ascend, Or oats their ample panicles extend; There rest thy glebe, left fallow not in vain, To feel the summer's sun and winter's rain. FIRST. The skill'd in culture oft repay their toil By choice of plants adapted to their soil; The spiky saintfoin best on chalk succeeds, The lucern hates cold clays and moory meads. SECOND. Best on loose sands, where brakes and briars once rose, Its deep-fring'd leaves the yellow carrot shows; Best on stiff loam rough teasels Teasel: Dipsacus Sativus. This plant is cultivated, in many places, for the use of the woollen manufacture. There are large fields of it in Essex; where the Coriander is also grown. rear their heads, And brown coriander's odorous umbel spreads. THIRD. On barren mountains, bleak with chilly air, Forbidding pasturage or the ploughman's care, Laburnum's boughs a beauteous bloom disclose, Or spiry pines a gloomy grove compose. FIRST. On rushy marshes, rank with watry weeds, Clothe the clear'd soil with groves of waving reeds; Of them the gard'ner annual fences forms, To shield his tender plants from vernal storms. SECOND. Cantabrian hills the purple saffron show; Blue fields of flax in Lincoln's fenland blow; On Kent's rich plains, green hop-grounds scent the gales; And apple-groves deck Hereford's golden vales There is a part of Herefordshire, from its extraordinary fertility and pleasantness, usually denominated The Golden Vale.. THIRD. Shelter'd by woods the weald of Sussex lies; Her smooth green downs sublime from Ocean rise: That, fittest soil supplies for growth of grain; These, yield best pasture for the fleecy train. FIRST. Say, friends! whoe'er his residence might chuse, Would these sweet scenes of sylvan shade refuse, And seek the black waste of the barren wold, That yields no shelter from the heat or cold? SECOND. Dull are slow Ousa's mist-exhaling plains, Where long rank grass the morning dew retains: Who pastures there in Autumn's humid reign, His flock from sickness hopes to save in vain. THIRD. The bleak, flat, sedgy shores of Essex shun, Where fog perpetual veils the winter sun; Though flattering Fortune there invite thy stay, Thy health the purchase of her smiles must pay. FIRST. When, harvest past, thy ricks of yellow corn Rise round the yard, and scent the breeze of morn; Rude Winter's rage with timely care to avert, Let the skill'd thatcher ply his useful art. SECOND. When thy ripe walnuts deck the glossy spray, Ere pilfering rooks purloin them fast away, Wield thy tough pole, and lash the trees amain, Till leaves and husks the lawn beneath distain. THIRD. When thy green orchards fraught with fruit appear, Thy lofty ladder 'midst the boughs uprear; Thy basket's hook upon the branch suspend, And with the fragrant burden oft descend. FIRST. Spread on the grass, or pil'd in heaps, behold The pearmain's red, the pippin's speckled gold; There shall the russet's auburn rind be seen, The redstreak's stripes, and nonpareil's bright green. SECOND. These on dry straw, in airy chambers, lay, Where windows clear admit the noon-tide ray; They, safe from frosts, thy table shall supply, Fresh to the taste, and pleasing to the eye. THIRD. When favouring seasons yield thee store to spare, The circling mill and cumbrous press prepare; From copious vats, the well-fermented juice Will sparkling beverage for thy board produce. FIRST. From red to black when bramble-berries change, And boys for nuts the hazel copses range, On new-reap'd fields the thick strong stubble mow, And safe in stacks about thy homestead stow. SECOND. With purple fruit when elder-branches bend, And their bright hues the hips and cornels blend, Ere yet chill hoar frost comes, or sleety rain, Sow with choice wheat the neatly furrow'd plain. THIRD. When clamorous fieldfares seek the frozen mead, And lurking snipes by gurgling runnels feed; Then 'midst dry fodder let thy herds be found, Where sheltering sheds the well-stor'd crib surround. FIRST. Though Winter reigns, our labours never fail: Then all day long we hear the sounding flail; And oft the beetle's strenuous stroke descends, That knotty block-wood into billets rends. SECOND. Then in the barns in motion oft are seen The rustling corn-fan, and the wiry screen: In sacks the tasker measures up his grain, And loads for market on the spacious wain. THIRD. Th' inclosure fence then claims our timely care, The ditch to deepen, and the bank repair; The well-plash'd hedge with frequent stakes confine, And o'er its top tough wyths of hazel twine. FIRST. Where in the croft the russet hayrick stands, The dextrous binder twists his sedgy bands, Across the stack his sharp-edg'd engine guides, And the hard mass in many a truss divides Hay is usually cut with an oblong, triangular instrument, called a Cutting-knife.. SECOND. When frost thy turnips fixes in the ground, And hungry flocks for food stand bleating round, Let sturdy youths their pointed peckers ply, Till the rais'd roots loose on the surface lie. THIRD. When stormy days constrain to quit the field, The house or barn may useful business yield; There crooked snaths Snath, is the technical term for the handle of a scythe. of flexile sallow make, Or of tough ash the fork-stale and the rake. FIRST. Full many a chance defeats the farmer's pains, Full many a loss diminishes his gains; Wet spoils the seed, or frosts its growth o'erpower, Beasts break the stalk, and birds the grain devour. SECOND. While plenteous crops reward thy toil and care, Thy liberal aid may Age and Sickness share! Nor let the widow'd cottager deplore Her fireless hearth, her cupboard's scanty store. THIRD. The haughty lord, whom lust of gain inspires, From man and beast excessive toil requires: The generous master views with pitying eyes Their lot severe, and food and rest supplies. FIRST. Amid Achaia's streamy vales of old, Of works and days th' Ascrean Pastor told: Around him, curious, came the rustic throng, And wondering listen'd to th' informing song. SECOND. Where fam'd Anapus' limpid waters stray, Sicilia's Poet tun'd his Doric lay; While o'er his head the pine's dark foliage hung, And at his feet the bubbling fountain sprung. THIRD. The Latian Maro sung, where Mincio's stream Through groves of ilex cast a silvery gleam; While down green vallies stray'd his fleecy flocks, Or slept in shadow of the mossy rocks. FIRST. Fair fame to him, the bard whose song displays Of rural arts the knowledge and the praise! Rich as the field with ripen'd harvest whiteâ A scene of profit mingled with delight! SECOND. As dewy cherries to the taste in June, As shady lanes to travellers at noon, To me so welcome is the Shepherd's strain; To kindred spirits never sung in vain! THIRD. While lindens sweet and spiky chesnuts blow, While beech bears mast, on oaks while acorns grow; So long shall last the Shepherd's tuneful rhyme, And please in every age and every clime! ORIENTAL ECLOGUES. ZERAD; OR, THE ABSENT LOVER: AN ARABIAN ECLOGUE. THE learned and ingenious Mr. Jones, in his elegant and judicious Essay on the Poetry of Eastern Nations, speaking of the Arabians, has the following passage: âIt sometimes happens,â says he, âthat the young men of one tribe are in love with the damsels of another; and, as the tents are frequently removed on a sudden, the lovers are often separated in the progress of the courtship. Hence, almost all the Arabic poems open in this manner: The author bewails the sudden departure of his mistress, Hinda, Maia, Zeineb, or Azza, and describes her beauty; comparing her to a wanton fawn that plays among the aromatic shrubs. His friends endeavour to comfort him; but he refuses consolation; he declares his resolution of visiting his beloved, though the way to her tribe lie through a dreadful wilderness, or even through a den of lions.ââThe Author of the following Eclogue was struck with this outline, and has attempted to fill it up. An apology for expatiating on the pleasing subjects of Love and Beauty, when nothing is said to offend the ear of Chastity, he supposes needless. If any, however, there be, who question the utility of at all describing those subjects; such may remember, that there is an Eastern Poem, generally esteemed sacred, which abounds with the most ardent expressions of the one, and luxuriant pictures of the other. Korasa's Tribe, a frequent-wandering train, From Zenan's pastures sought Negiran's plain. With them Semira left her favourite shades, The loveliest nymph of Yemen's sportive maids! Her parting hand her fair companions prest; A transient sorrow touch'd each tender breast; As some thin cloud across the morning ray Casts one short moment's gloom, and glides away: Their cares, their sports, they hasted soon to tend, And lost in them the memory of their friend. But gallant Zerad ill her absence bore,â A wealthy Emir from Katara's shore; A warrior he, the bravest of his race; A bard high-honoured in his native place; Age oft learn'd knowledge from his tuneful tongue, And listening Beauty languish'd while he sung. What time the tribes in camp contiguous lay, Oft with the Fair-one he was wont to stray; There oft for her fresh fruits and flow'rs he sought, And oft her flocks to chrystal fountains brought. Where the tall palm-grove grac'd Alzobah's green, And sable tents in many a rank were seen The Arabian Tents are black. Vide Canticles, i. 5.; While Evening's steps the setting Sun pursued, And the still fields her balmy tears bedew'd; The pensive Lover, there reclin'd apart, Indulg'd the sorrows of his anxious heart.

SERIM; OR, THE ARTIFICIAL FAMINE. AN EAST-INDIAN ECLOGUE. THE following account of British conduct and its consequences, in Bengal and the adjacent provinces, some years ago, will afford a sufficient idea of the subject of the following Eclogue. After describing the monopoly of salt, betel-nut, and tobacco, the Historian thus proceeds: âMoney, in this current, came but by drops; it could not quench the thirst of those who waited in India to receive it. An expedient, such as it was, remained to quicken its pace.âThe natives could live with little salt, but not without food. Some of the agents saw themselves well situated for collecting the rice into stores; they did so. They knew the Gentoos would rather die, than violate the precepts of their religion by eating flesh. The alternative would therefore be, between giving what they had, and dying. The inhabitants sunk; they that cultivated the land, and saw the harvest at the disposal of others, planted in doubt; scarcity ensued; then the monopoly was easier managed. The people took to roots, and food they had been unaccustomed to eat. Sickness ensued. In some districts, the languid Living left the bodies of their numerous Dead unburied.â âShort History of English Transactions in the East-Indies, p. 145. The above quotation sufficiently proves, that the general plan of the following Poem is founded on fact. And, even with regard to its particlar incidents, there can be little doubt, but that, among the varied miseries of millions, every picture of distress, which the Author has drawn, had its original. âO Guardian Genius of this sacred wave The Hindoos worship a God or Genius of the Ganges.! âO save thy sons, if thine the power to save!â So Serim spoke, as sad on Ganges' shore He sat, his country's miseries to deploreâ âO Guardian Genius of this sacred wave! âO save thy sons, if thine the power to save! âFrom Agra's tow'rs to Muxadabat's Muxadabat, or Morshedabat, a large city of India, about two hundred miles above Calcutta.

LI-PO; OR, THE GOOD GOVERNOR: A CHINESE ECLOGUE. THOSE who are conversant in the best accounts of China, particularly Du Halde's History, must have remarked, that the Chinese government, though arbitrary, is well regulated and mild; and that a prince, in that country, can acquire no glory, but by attention to the welfare of his subjects. On this general idea is founded the plan of the following Poem. Where Honan's hills Kiansi's vale inclose, And Xifa's lake its glassy level shows; Li-po's fair island layâdelightful scene!â With swelling slopes, and groves of every green: On azure rocks his rich pavilion plac'd, Rear'd its light front with golden columns grac'd; High o'er the roof a weeping willow hung, And jasmine boughs the lattice twin'd among; In porcelain vases crested amaranth grew, And starry after, crimson, white, and blue; Lien-hoa flowers upon the water spread; Bright shells and corals varied lustre shed; From sparry grottos chrystal drops distill'd On sounding brass, and air with music fill'd; Soft thro' the bending canes the breezes play'd, The rustling leaves continual murmur made; Gay shoals of gold-fish glitter'd in the tide, And gaudy birds flew sportive by its side. The distant prospects well the sight might please, With pointed mountains, and romantic trees: From craggy cliffs, between the verdant shades, The silver rills rush'd down in bright cascades; O'er terrac'd steeps rich cotton harvests The Chinese reduce the steep slopes of their hills into little terraces, on which they grow cotton, potatoes, &amp;c. They plant the edges of their terraces with trees, which keep up the ground, and make a very fine appearance. wav'd, And smooth canals the rice-clad valley lav'd; Long rows of cypress Their rice-grounds are separated by broad ditches, the sides of which are planted with cypresses. Vide Osbeck's Voyage to China. parted all the land, And tall pagodas crown'd the river's strand! 'Twas here, from business and its pomp and pain, The pensive master sought relief in vain. Li-po, mild prince, a viceroy's sceptre sway'd, And ten fair towns his gentle rule obey'd: The morn's transactions to his memory came, And some he found to praise, and some to blame; Mark'd here how justice, pity there prevail'd, And how from haste or indolence he fail'd. Beneath a bower of sweet Ka-fa, whose bloom Fill'd all the adjacent lawn with rich perfume, His slaves at distance satâa beauteous train!â One wak'd the lute, and one the vocal strain: They saw his brow with care all clouded o'er, And wish'd to ease the anxiety he bore. Amusive tales their soothing lay disclos'd, Of heroes brave to perils strange expos'd; Of tyrants proud, from power's high summit cast; And lovers, long desponding, blest at last. They ceas'd; the warblings softly died away, Like zephyrs ceasing at the close of day. âThis scene,â said he, âhow fair! to please the sight âHow Nature's charms, Art's ornaments unite! âThose maids, what magic in the strains they sung! âSong sweetliest flows from Beauty's tuneful tongue. âYet say, did Tien bid power and wealth be mine, âFor me my soul to pleasure to resign? âWhat boots that annual, on our fathers' tombs, âWe strew fair flowers, and offer choice perfumes; âOur veneration of their memories shew, âAnd not their steps in Virtue's path pursue? âWhen, from his province as the prince returns, âRich feasts for him are spread, and incense burns, âAnd gilded barks unfold their streamers gay, âAnd following crowds their loud applauses pay; âAvails all this, if he from right has swerv'd, âAnd Conscience tells him all is undeserv'd? âArise, Li-po! 'tis Duty calls, arise! âThe sun sinks reddening in Tartarian skies. âYon walls that tower o'er Xensi's neighbouring plain, âYon walls unnumber'd miseries contain. âThink, why did Tien superior rank impart, âForce of the mind, or feelings of the heart. âLast night in sleep, to Fancy's sight display'd, âLay lovelier scenes than e'er my eyes survey'd; âWith purple shone the hills, with gold the vales, âAnd greenest foliage wav'd in gentlest gales: â'Midst palmy fields, with sunshine ever bright, âA palace rear'd its walls of silvery white; âThe gates of pearl a shady hall disclos'd, âWhere old Confucius' rev'rend form repos'd: âLoose o'er his limbs the silk's light texture flow'd, âHis eye serene etherial lustre show'd: âMy son,â said he, as near his seat I drew, âCast round this wonderous spot thy dazzled view; âSee how, by lucid founts in myrtle bowers, âThe blest inhabitants consume their hours! âThey ne'er to War, fell Fiend! commission gave âTo murder, ravage, banish, and enslave; âThey ne'er bade Grandeur raise her gorgeous pile, âWith tribute ravish'd from the hand of Toil; âBut parents, guardians of the people reign'd, âThe weak defended, and the poor sustain'd.â âSmiling he ceas'dâthe vision seem'd to fly, âLike fleecy clouds dispersing in the sky. âArise, Li-po! and cast thy robes aside, âDisguise thy form, thy well-known features hide; âGo forth, yon streets, yon crowded streets pervade, âMix with the throng, and mark who seeks thy aid: âThere Avarice stern, o'er Poverty bears sway, âAnd Age and Sickness fall his easy prey; âThere hands that Justice' sacred ensigns bear, âProtect the plunderer, and the plunder share; âPerhaps there Discord's desperate rage prevails, âAnd Wisdom's voice to calm the tumult fails; âPerhaps Revenge gives victims to the grave, âPerhaps they perish, ere I haste to save!â He spoke, and rose; but now along the way That from the city-gate fair-winding lay, Stretch'd thro' green meads where lowing cattle graz'd, Amid the lake's wide silver level rais'd, Led up steep rocks by painted bridges join'd, Or near thin trees that o'er the tide inclin'd, Slow tow'rds his palace came a suppliant train;â Whoe'er his presence sought ne'er sought in vainâ The ready vessel, waiting at his call, Receiv'd, and bore him to the audience-hall. ODES. THE Horatian, or lesser Ode, is characterised principally by ease and correctness. The following little Pieces, attempted on that plan, were the production of very different periods, and, on revisal, were thought not undeserving a place in this Collection. ODE I. TO LEISURE. Gentle Leisure, whom of yore To Wealth the fair Contentment bore, When Peace with them her dwelling made, And Health her kind attendance paid; As wandering o'er the sunny plains They fed their herds and fleecy trains:â O Thou! who country scenes and air Preferr'st to courts and crowds and care; With Thee I've often pass'd the day, To Thee I wake the grateful lay. With Thee on Chadwell's thymy brow Chadwell: The New River Head, near Ware., Beneath the hazel's bending bough, I've sat to breathe the fragrance cool Exhaling from the glassy pool; Where, thro' th' unsullied chrystal seen, The bottom show'd its shining green: As, all-attentive, these I view'd, And many a pleasing thought pursued, Whate'er of pleasure they bestow'd, Still I to Thee that pleasure ow'd! With Thee, on Mussla's Mussla: a hill on the north side of Ware. corn-clad height The landscape oft has charm'd my sight; Delightful hills, and vales and woods, And dusty roads, and winding floods; And towns, that thro' thin groups of shade Their roofs of varied form display'd: As, all-attentive, these I view'd, And many a pleasing thought pursued, Whate'er of pleasure they bestow'd, Still I to Thee that pleasure ow'd! With Thee, where Easna's Easna: a pleasant wood, east of Ware. hornbeam-grove Its foliage o'er me interwove, Along the lonely path I've stray'd, By banks in hoary moss array'd; Where tufts of azure orpine grew, And branchy fern of brighter hue: As, all-attentive, these I view'd, And many a pleasing thought pursued, Whate'er of pleasure they bestow'd, Still I to Thee that pleasure ow'd! With Thee, by Stansted's Stansted: a village in the same neighbourhood. farms inclos'd, With aged elms in rows dispos'd; Or where her chapel's walls appear, The silver winding river near, Beneath the broad-leav'd sycamore, I've linger'd on the shady shore: As, all-attentive, these I view'd, And many a pleasing thought pursued, Whate'er of pleasure they bestow'd, Still I to Thee that pleasure ow'd! With Thee, where Thames his waters leads Round Poplar's Isle Poplar's Isle; commonly called The Isle of Dogs, opposite Greenwich. of verdant meads, Along the undulating tide, I've seen the white-sail'd vessels glide; Or gaz'd on London's lofty towers, Or Dulwich hills, or Greenwich bowers: As, all-attentive, these I view'd, And many a pleasing thought pursued, Whate'er of pleasure they bestow'd, Still I to Thee that pleasure ow'd! O gentle Leisure!âabsent longâ I woo thee with this tuneful song: If e'er, allur'd by grateful change, O'er scenes yet unbeheld I range, And Albion's east or western shore For rural solitudes explore: As, all-attentive, these I view, And many a pleasing thought pursue, Whate'er of pleasure they bestow, To Thee that pleasure I must owe! ODE II. THE EVENING WALK. What time fair Spring, with dewy hand, Awakes her cowslip bloom; And hawthorn boughs, by breezes fann'd, Diffuse a rich perfume: Young Theron down the valley stray'd At evening's silent hour; When bright the setting sunbeams play'd On Hertford's distant tower. He sigh'd, and cast around his eye O'er all the pleasing scene; Now tow'rds the golden-clouded sky, Now on the fields of green. âThrice has fair Spring her cowslip bloom âAwak'd with dewy hand; âAnd hawthorn boughs diffus'd perfume, âBy western breezes fann'd; âSince here, at evening's silent hour, âDelighted oft I stray'd; âWhile bright on Hertford's distant tower âThe setting sunbeams play'd: â'Twas then the flatterer Hope was near, âAnd sung this soothing strain: âWhere thro' the trees yon tow'rs appear âFar o'er the level plain; âThere oft thy pleasant evening walk âThy favourite Maid shall join, âAnd all the charms of tender talk âAnd tuneful song be thine: âWith thee she'll hear the bleat of flocks, âThe throstle's mellow lay; âThe rills that murmur o'er the rocks, âThe whispers of the spray.ââ âSo sung false HopeâDeceiv'd I heard, âAnd set my heart at ease; âThe future then so fair appear'd, âIt made the present please. âSo sung false HopeâThe approaching years, âThat distant look'd so gay, âWith clouds of cares and storms of fears âAll fraught, have pass'd away. âAs glides yon sun adown the sky, âAs rolls yon rapid stream; âSo fast our joys and sorrows fly, âAnd flown appear a dream. âBe then the events that Time has brought, âTo me not brought in vain; âBy painful disappointment taught, âLet wisdom be my gain!â Thus Theron spoke, and earnest eyed The sun's departing ray; Again he look'd, again he sigh'd, And homeward bent his way. ODE III. TO CHILDHOOD. Childhood! happiest stage of life, Free from care and free from strife, Free from Memory's ruthless reign, Fraught with scenes of former pain; Free from Fancy's cruel skill, Fabricating future ill; Time, when all that meets the view, All can charm, for all is new; How thy long-lost hours I mourn, Never, never, to return! Then to toss the circling ball, Caught rebounding from the wall; Then the mimic ship to guide Down the kennel's dirty tide; Then the hoop's revolving pace Thro' the dusty street to chace; O what joy!âit once was mine, Childhood, matchless boon of thine!â How thy long-lost hours I mourn, Never, never, to return! ODE IV. HEARING MUSIC. Yon organ! hark!âhow soft, how sweet, The warbling notes in concert meet! The sound my fancy leads To climes where PhÅbus' brightest beams Gild jasmine groves and chrystal streams And lily-mantled meads; Where myrtle bowers their bloom unfold Where citrons bend with fruit of gold, Where grapes depress the vines; Where, on the bank with roses gay, Love, Innocence, and Pleasure play, And Beauty's form reclines. Now different tones and measures flow, And, gravely deep, and sadly slow, Involve the mind in gloom; I seem to join the mournful train, Attendant round the couch of Pain, Or leaning o'er the tomb: To where the orphan'd infant sleeps, To where the love-lorn damsel weeps, I pitying seem to stray; Methinks I watch his cradle near; Methinks her drooping thoughts I chear, And wipe her tears away. Now loud the tuneful thunders roll, And rouse and elevate the soul O'er earth and all its care; I seem to hear from heavenly plains Angelic choirs responsive strains, And in their raptures share. ODE V. A LANDSCAPE. On the eastern hill's steep side Spreads the rural hamlet wide; 'Cross the vale, where willows rise, Further still another lies; And, beneath a steeper hill, Lies another further still: Near them many a field and groveâ Scenes where Health and Labour rove! Northward swelling slopes are seen, Clad with corn-fields neat and green; There, thro' grassy plains below, Broad and smooth the waters flow; While the town, their banks along, Bids its clustering houses throng, In the sunshine glittering fair; Haunts of Business, haunts of Care! Westward o'er the yellow meads Wind the rills thro' waving reeds; From dark elms a shadow falls On the abbey's whiten'd walls: Wide the park's green lawns expand; Thick its tufted lindens stand: Fair retreat! that well might please Wealth, and Elegance, and Ease. Hark! amidst the distant shades Murmuring drop the deep cascades; Hark! amidst the rustling trees Softly sighs the gentle breeze: And the Eolian harp, reclin'd Obvious to the stream of wind, Pours its wildly-warbled strain, Rising now, now sunk again. How the view detains the sight! How the sounds the ear delight!â Sweet the scene! but think not there Happiness sincere to share: Reason still regrets the day Passing rapidly away; Lessening Life's too little store; Passing, to return no more! ODE VI. TO A FRIEND, ON HIS MARRIAGE, AND REMOVAL INTO THE COUNTRY. [Written at Stanway-Hall, in Essex.] Whate'er of lighter strain the Muse Essay'd, in vacant hours of ease, At thy expence to raise a smile, I deem thy candour will excuse; For sure I meant not to displease, For sure I wish'd thee well the while The Author alludes to some trifling pieces of humour, written on his Friend, for the amusement of a few intimate acquaintance.. And now the nuptial knot is tied, That Muse no idle flattery brings, Nor talks of joy unmixt with careâ I trust that none who e'er has tried The sober state of human things, Will give thee hope such joy to share. Domestic Life must soon be thineâ 'Tis various as an April day; 'Tis pleasure now, and now 'tis pain: Thro' storms of foul and gleams of fine Contented hold thy steady way, And these enjoy, and those sustain. From London's streets to solitude, From brilliant shops to dirty fields, From beaux and belles to rugged hindsâ The change I own is strange and rude: Yet scarce a place so little yields, But he who seeks amusement finds. Perchance thou'lt not disdain to hear The ploughman's history of the plain; Thy sight the prospect's scenes may charm: And sure fastidious is the ear, That slights the milkmaid's simple strain, At evening echoing from the farm. The market lore of artful swains; The price of cattle and of corn, The sportsman's feats of dogs and guns;â To practise that will cost thee pains; And these with patience must be born, For he will be dislik'd who shuns. Courage, my friend! whate'er our fate; So versatile the human mind, That oft, when novelty is o'er, To objects of our former hate Assimilated and resign'd, We wonder they displeas'd before. 'Twas on the festive, social day, Where Beauty cast her smiles around, And Mirth the mind from care reliev'd; What time our hands in harmless play Thy brow with wreaths of myrtle bound, My thoughts this grateful lay conceiv'd. From Stanway's groves, from fields of Layer Layer Breton: a village in Essex., To other scenes and other friends To-morrow calls my steps away; Yet Memory them in view shall bear; Yet them the wish of health attends, And many a moment calm and gay. ODE VII. WRITTEN IN WINTER. While in the sky black clouds impend, And fogs arise, and rains descend, And one brown prospect opens round Of leafless trees and furrow'd ground; Save where unmelted spots of snow Upon the shaded hill-side show; While chill winds blow, and torrents roll, The scene disgusts the sight, depresses all the soul. Yet worse what polar climates shareâ Vast regions, dreary, bleak, and bare!â There, on an icy mountain's height, Seen only by the moon's pale light, Stern Winter rears his giant form, His robe a mist, his voice a storm: His frown the shivering nations fly, And hid for half the year in smoky caverns lie. Yet there the lamp's perpetual blaze Can pierce the gloom with chearing rays; Yet there the heroic tale or song Can urge the lingering hours along; Yet there their hands with timely care The kajak Kajak: a Greenland fishing-boat. and the dart prepare, On summer seas to work their way, And wage the watry war, and make the seals their prey. Too Delicate! reproach no more The seasons of thy native shoreâ There soon shall Spring descend the sky, With smiling brow and placid eye; A primrose wreath surrounds her hair, Her green robe floats upon the air; And, scatter'd from her liberal hand, Fair blossoms deck the trees, fair flow'rs adorn the land. ODE VIII. TO A FRIEND. Where Grove-hill At Camberwell, in Surry. shows thy villa fair, But late, my Lettsom, there with thee 'Twas mine the tranquil hour to shareâ The social hour of converse free; To mark the arrangement of thy ground, And all the pleasing prospect round, Where, while we gaz'd, new beauties still were found. There, as the impending cloud of smoke Fled various from the varying gale, Full on the view fresh objects broke Along the extensive peopled vale, Beside Thamesis' bending stream, From ancient Lambeth's west extreme, To Limehouse glittering in the evening beam. And now and then the glancing eye Caught glimpse of spots remoter still, On Hampstead's street-clad slope so high, Or Harrow's far conspicuous hill; Or eastward wander'd to explore All Peckham's pleasant level o'er, To busy Deptford's vessel-crowded shore: Or sought that southern landscape's bound, Those swelling mountsâone smooth and green, And one with oaken coverts crown'd, And one where scattering trees are seen The Dulwich hills.. 'Twas these, with Summer's radiance bright, That gave my earliest youth delight, Of rural scenes the first that met my sight The Author was born in the environs of London, on the Surry side.. That Business, with fatiguing cares, For this delightful seat of thine Such scanty store of moments spares, Say, Friend, shall I for thee repine?â Were it the commerce of the main, Or culture of the teeming plain, From blame or pity I should scarce refrain. But O! to alleviate human woes, To banish sickness, banish pain, To give the sleepless eye repose, The nerveless arm its strength again; From parent eyes to dry the tear, The wife's distressful thought to chear, And end the husband's and the lover's fear; Where Want sits pining, faint, and ill, To lend thy kind, unpurchas'd aid, And hear the exertions of thy skill With many a grateful blessing paidâ 'Tis luxury to the feeling heart, Beyond what social hours impart, Or Nature's beauteous scenes, or curious works of Art! ODE IX. LEAVING BATH, MDCCLXXVI. Bath! ere I quit thy pleasing scene, Thy Beachen cliff I'll climb again, To view thy mountains vivid green, To view thy hill-surrounded plain: To see distinct beneath the eye, As in a pictur'd prospect nigh, Those Attic structures shining white, That form thy sunny crescent's bend, Or by thy dusty streets extend, Or near thy winding river's site. Did Commerce these proud piles upraise? For thee she ne'er unfurl'd her sailsâ Hygeia gave thy fountains praise, And Pain and Languor sought thy vales: But these suffic'd an humble cell, If they with Strength and Ease might dwell. Then Fashion call'd; his potent voice Proud Wealth with ready step obey'd, And Pleasure all her arts essay'd, To fix with thee the fickle choice. Precarious gift!âThy mansions gay, Where Peers and Beauties lead the ball, Neglected, soon may feel decay; Forsaken, moulder to their fall.â Palmyra, once like thee renown'd, Now lies a ruin on the ground.â But still thy environs so fair, Thy waters salutary aid, Will surely always some persuade To render thee their care. ODE X. TO J. PAYNE, ESQ. ACCOUNTANT-GENERAL OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND. O friend! to Thee, whose liberal mind Was form'd with taste for joys refin'd, For all the extended country yields, Of azure skies and verdant fields; For all that Genius' hand displays,â The Painter's forms, the Poet's lays:â To Thee, restraint to that dull room, Where sunshine never breaks the gloom; To Thee, restraint to that dull lore Of books, with numbers cypher'd o'erâ How hard the lot! I see with pain, And wish it oft exchang'd in vain. Yet not for Thee I ask the stores Which Rapine rends from foreign shores, Nor those Oppression's power procures From ills that Poverty endures. Far happier Thou! thy honest gain Can life with decency sustain; For Thee, Content, with thought serene, Surveys the present changeful scene; And Piety her view sublime Extends beyond the realm of Time. ODE XI. TO A FRIEND APPREHENSIVE OF DECLINING FRIENDSHIP. Too much in Man's imperfect state Mistake produces useless pain.â Methinks, of Friendship's frequent fate I hear my Frogley's voice complain. This heart, I hope, forgives its foes; I know it ne'er forgets its friends; Where'er may Chance my steps dispose, The absent oft my thought attends. Deem not that Time's oblivious hand From Memory's page has ras'd the days, By Lee's green verge we wont to stand, And on his chrystal current gaze. From Chadwell's cliffs, o'erhung with shade, From Widbury's prospect-yielding hill, Sweet look'd the scenes we then survey'd, While Fancy sought for sweeter still: Then how did Learning's stores delight! From books what pleasures then we drew! For then their charms first met our sight, And then their faults we little knew. Alas! Life's Summer swiftly flies, And few its hours of bright and fair! Why bid Distrust's chill east-wind rise, To blast the scanty blooms they bear? ODE XII. TO A FRIEND. No, Cockfield, no! I'll not disdain Thy Upton's elm-divided plain; Nor scorn the varied views it yields, O'er Bromley's creeks and isles of reeds, Or Ham's or Plaistow's level meads, To Woolwich streets, or Charlton fields: Thy hedge-row paths I'll pleasant call, And praise the lonely lane that leads To that old tower upon the wall. 'Twas when Misfortune's stroke severe, And Melancholy's presence drear, Had made my Amwell's groves displease, That thine my weary steps receiv'd, And much the change my mind reliev'd, And much thy kindness gave me ease; For o'er the past as thought would stray, That thought thy voice as oft retriev'd, To scenes which fair before us lay. And there, in happier hours, the walk Has frequent pleas'd with friendly talk; From theme to theme that wander'd stillâ The long detail of where we had been, And what we had heard, and what we had seen; And what the Poet's tuneful skill, And what the Painter's graphic art, Or Antiquarian's searches keen, Of calm amusement could impart. Then oft did Nature's works engage, And oft we search'd LinnÃ¦us' page; The Scanian Sage, whose wond'rous toil Had class'd the vegetable race: And curious, oft from place to place, We rang'd, and sought each different soil, Each different plant intent to view, And all the marks minute to trace, Whence he his nice distinctions drew. O moments these, not ill employ'd! O moments, better far enjoy'd Than those in crowded cities pass'd; Where oft to Luxury's gaudy reign Trade lends her feeble aid in vain, Till Pride, a bankrupt wretch at last, Bids Fraud his specious wiles essay, Youth's easy confidence to gain, Or Industry's poor pittance rend away! ODE XIII. I hate that drum's discordant sound, Parading round, and round, and round: To thoughtless youth it pleasure yields, And lures from cities and from fields, To sell their liberty for charms Of tawdry lace, and glittering arms; And when Ambition's voice commands, To march, and fight, and fall, in foreign lands. I hate that drum's discordant sound, Parading round, and round, and round: To me it talks of ravag'd plains, And burning towns, and ruin'd swains, And mangled limbs, and dying groans, And widows tears, and orphans moans; And all that Misery's hand bestows, To fill the catalogue of human woes. ODE XIV. WRITTEN AFTER READING SOME MODERN LOVE-VERSES. Take hence this tuneful Trifler's lays! I'll hear no more the unmeaning strain Of Venus' doves, and Cupid's darts, And killing eyes, and wounded hearts; All Flattery's round of fulsome praise, All Falsehood's cant of fabled pain. Bring me the Muse whose tongue has told Love's genuine plaintive tender tale; Bring me the Muse whose sounds of woe 'Midst Death's dread scenes so sweetly flow, When Friendship's faithful breast lies cold, When Beauty's blooming cheek is pale: Bring thefeâI like their grief sincere; It sooths my sympathetic gloom: For, oh! Love's genuine pains I've borne, And Death's dread rage has made me mourn; I've wept o'er Friendship's early bier, And dropt the tear on Beauty's tomb. ODE XV. THE MUSE; OR, POETICAL ENTHUSIASM. The Muse! whate'er the Muse inspires, My soul the tuneful strain admires: The Poet's birth, I ask not where, His place, his name, they're not my care; Nor Greece nor Rome delights me more Than Tagus' bank alluding to Camoens, the epic poet of Portugal; of whose Lusiad we have a well known masterly translation by Mr. Mickle., or Thames's shore alluding to Milton, Pope, &amp;c.: From silver Avon's flowery side Tho' Shakespeare's numbers sweetly glide, As sweet, from Morven's desart hills, My ear the voice of Ossian fills. The Muse! whate'er the Muse inspires, My soul the tuneful strain admires: Nor bigot zeal, nor party rage Prevail, to make me blame the page; I scorn not all that Dryden sings Because he flatters courts and kings; And from the master lyre of Gray When pomp of music breaks away, Not less the sound my notice draws, For that 'tis heard in Freedom's cause. The Muse! whate'er the Muse inspires, My soul the tuneful strain admires: Where Wealth's bright sun propitious shines, No added lustre marks the lines; Where Want extends her chilling shades, No pleasing flower of Fancy fades; A scribbling peer's applauded lays Might claim, but claim in vain, my praise From that poor Youth, whose tales relate Sad Juga's fears and Bawdin's fate See Rowley's Poems, supposed to have been written by Chatterton, an unhappy youth born at Bristol.. The Muse! whate'er the Muse inspires, My soul the tuneful strain admires: When Fame her wreath well-earn'd bestows, My breast no latent envy knows; My Langhorne's verse I lov'd to hear, And Beattie's song delights my ear; And his, whom Athens' Tragic Maid Now leads through Scarning's lonely glade, While he for British nymphs bids flow Her notes of terror and of woe See Mr. Potter's excellent Translation of Ãschylus and Euripides.. The Muse! whate'er the Muse inspires, My soul the tuneful strain admires: Or be the verse of blank or rhyme, The theme or humble or sublime; If Pastoral's hand my journey leads Thro' harvest fields or new-mown meads; If Epic's voice sonorous calls To Åta's cliffs See Mr. Glover's Leonidas, alluded to as an example of Classical dignity and simplicity. or Salem's walls See Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, alluded to as an example of Gothic fancy and magnificence.; Enoughâthe Muse, the Muse inspires! My soul the tuneful strain admires. ODE XVI. VIEWING THE RUINS OF AN ABBEY TO A FRIEND. How steep yon mountains rise around, How bold yon gloomy woods ascend! How loud the rushing torrents sound That 'midst these heaps of ruin bend, Where one arch'd gateway yet remains, And one lone aisle its roof retains, And one tall turret's walls impend! Here once a self-sequester'd train Renounc'd life's tempting pomp and glare; Rejected power, relinquish'd gain, And shunn'd the great, and shunn'd the fair: The voluntary slaves of toil, By day they till'd their little soil, By night they awoke, and rose to prayer. Tho' Superstition much we blame, That bade them thus consume their years; Their motive still our praise must claim, Their constancy our thought reveres: And sure their solitary scheme Must check each passion's wild extreme, And save them cares, and save them fears. Their convent's round contain'd their all; Their minds no sad presage opprest, What fate might absent wealth befal, How absent friends might be distrest: Domestic ills ne'er hurt their ease; They nought of pain could feel from these, Who no domestic joys possest. But Imperfection haunts each place: Would this kind calm atone to thee For Fame's or Fortune's sprightly chace, Whose prize in prospect still we see; Or Hymen's happy moments blest, With Beauty leaning on thy breast, Or Childhood prattling at thy knee? ODE XVII. PRIVATEERING. How Custom steels the human breast To deeds that Nature's thoughts detest! How Custom consecrates to fame What Reason else would give to shame! Fair Spring supplies the favouring gale, The Naval Plunderer spreads his sail, And ploughing wide the watry way, Explores with anxious eyes his prey. The man he never saw before, The man who him no quarrel bore, He meets, and Avarice prompts the fight; And Rage enjoys the dreadful sight Of decks with streaming crimson dy'd, And wretches struggling in the tide, Or, 'midst th' explosion's horrid glare, Dispers'd with quivering limbs in air. The merchant now on foreign shores His captur'd wealth in vain deplores; Quits his fair home, O mournful change! For the dark prison's scanty range; By Plenty's hand so lately fed, Depends on casual alms for bread; And, with a father's anguish torn, Sees his poor offspring left forlorn. And yet, such Man's misjudging mind, For all this injury to his kind, The prosperous Robber's native plain Shall bid him welcome home again; His name the song of every street, His acts the theme of all we meet, And oft the artist's skill shall place To public view his pictur'd face! If glory thus be earn'd, for me My object glory ne'er shall be; No, first in Cambria's loneliest dale Be mine to hear the shepherd's tale! No, first on Scotia's bleakest hill Be mine the stubborn soil to till! Remote from wealth, to dwell alone, And die, to guilty praise unknown! ODE XVIII. TO HOSPITALITY. Domestic Power! erewhile rever'd Where Syria spread her palmy plain, Where Greece her tuneful Muses heard, Where Rome beheld her Patriot Train; Thou to Albion too wert known, 'Midst the moat and moss-grown wall That girt her Gothic-structur'd hall With rural trophies strown. The traveller, doubtful of his way, Upon the pathless forest wild; The huntsman, in the heat of day, And with the tedious chace o'ertoil'd; Wide their view around them cast, Mark'd the distant rustic tower, And sought and found the festive bower, And shar'd the free repast. E'en now, on Caledonia's shore, When Eve's dun robe the sky arrays, Thy punctual hand unfolds the door, Thy eye the mountain road surveys; Pleas'd to spy the casual guest, Pleas'd with food his heart to cheer, With pipe or song to sooth his ear, And spread his couch for rest. Nor yet ev'n here disdain'd thy sway, Where Grandeur's splendid modern seat Far o'er the landscape glitters gay; Or where fair Quiet's lone retreat Hides beneath the hoary hill, Near the dusky upland shade, Between the willow's glossy glade, And by the tinkling rill. There thine the pleasing interviews That friends and relatives endear, When scenes not often seen amuse, When tales not often told we hear; There the scholar's liberal mind Oft instruction gives and gains, And oft the lover's lore obtains His fair-one's audience kind. O gentle Power! where'er thy reign, May Health and Peace attend thee still; Nor Folly's presence cause thee pain, Nor Vice reward thy good with ill: Gratitude thy altar raise, Wealth to thee her offerings pay, And Genius wake his tuneful lay To celebrate thy praise.

ODE XX. This scene how rich from Thames's side, While evening suns their amber beam Spread o'er the glassy-surfac'd tide, And 'midst the masts and cordage gleam; Blaze on the roofs with turrets crown'd, And gild green pastures stretch'd around, And gild the slope of that high ground, Whose cornfields bright the prospect bound Shooter's Hill. This view was taken on the North side of the Thames, at Ratcliff.! The white sails glide along the shore, Red streamers on the breezes play, The boatmen ply the dashing oar, And wide their various freight convey; Some Neptune's hardy thoughtless train, And some the careful sons of gain, And some the enamour'd nymph and swain Listening to music's soothing strain. But there, while these the sight allure, Still Fancy wings her flight away, To woods recluse, and vales obscure, And streams that solitary stray; To view the pine-grove on the hill, The rocks that trickling springs distill, The meads that quivering aspins fill, Or alders crowding o'er the rill. And where the trees unfold their bloom, And where the banks their floriage bear, And all effuse a rich perfume That hovers in the soft calm air; The hedge-row path to wind along, To hear the bleating fleecy throng, To hear the skylark's airy song, And throstle's note so clear and strong. But say, if there our steps were brought, Would these their pow'r to please retain? Say, would not restless, roving thought Turn back to busy scenes again? O strange formation of the mind! Still, tho' the present fair we find, Still tow'rds the absent thus inclin'd, Thus fix'd on objects left behind! ODE XXI. WRITTEN AFTER A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL. Thee, Bristol, oft my thoughts recal, Thy Kingsdown brow and Brandon hill; The space, once circled by thy wall, Which tow'rs and spires of churches fill; And masts and sails of vessels tall, With trees and houses intermingled still! From Clifton's rocks how grand the sight, When Avon's dark tide rush'd between! How grand, from Henbury's woody height, The Severn's wide-spread watry scene, Her waves with trembling sunshine bright, And Cambrian hills beyond them rising green! To Mendip's ridge how stretch'd away My view, while Fancy sought the plain Where Blagdon's groves secluded lay, And heard my much-lov'd Poet's strain The late ingenious Dr. John Langhorne, then resident at Blagdon, near Bristol.! Ah! why so near, nor thither stray To meet the friend I ne'er shall meet again? Occasion's call averse to prize, Irresolute we oft remainâ She soon irrevocably flies, And then we mourn her flown in vain; While Pleasure's imag'd forms arise, Whose fancied loss Regret beholds with pain. And Bristol! why thy scenes explore, And why those scenes so soon resign, And fail to seek the spot that bore That wonderous tuneful Youth of thine, The Bard Chatterton., whose boasted ancient store Rose recent from his own exhaustless mine This is at least the Author's opinion, notwithstanding all that has hitherto appeared on the other side of the question. The last line alludes to one of the ingenious Mr. Mason in his Elegy to a young Nobleman: âSee from the depths of his exhaustless mine âHis glittering stores the tuneful spendthrift throws.â! Though Fortune all her gifts denied, Though Learning made him not her choice, The Muse still placed him at her side, And bade him in her smile rejoiceâ Description still his pen supplied, Pathos his thought, and Melody his voice! Conscious and proud of merit high, Fame's wreath he boldly claim'd to wear; But Fame, regardless, pass'd him by, Unknown, or deem'd unworth her care: The Sun of Hope forsook his sky; And all his land look'd dreary, bleak, and bare! Then Poverty, grim spectre, rose, And horror o'er the prospect threwâ His deep distress too nice to expose; Too nice for common aid to sue, A dire alternative he chose, And rashly from the painful scene withdrew. Ah! why for Genius' headstrong rage Did Virtue's hand no curb prepare? What boots, poor youth! that now thy page Can boast the publick praise to share, The learn'd in deep research engage, And lightly entertain the gentle fair? Ye, who superfluous wealth command, O why your kind relief delay'd? O why not snatch'd his desperate hand? His foot on Fate's dread brink not stay'd? What thanks had you your native land For a new Shakespeare or new Milton paid? For meâImagination's power Leads oft insensibly my way, To where, at midnight's silent hour, The crescent moon's slow-westering ray Pours full on Redcliff's lofty tower, And gilds with yellow light its walls of grey. 'Midst Toil and Commerce slumbering round, Lull'd by the rising tide's hoarse roar, There Frome and Avon willow-crown'd, I view sad-wandering by the shore, With streaming tears, and notes of mournful sound, Too late their hapless Bard, untimely lost, deplore. ODE XXII. TO CRITICISM. Fair Nymph! of Taste and Learning born, Whom Truth's and Candour's gifts adorn, The Muse's friend! to thee she sings: Accept the grateful verse she brings. When Genius, ranging Nature o'er, Collects his tributary store, What Matter's tract immense supplies, Or wide in Mind's vast region lies, And every thought with skill combines, And all transmits in tuneful lines; Then rapture sparkling in thine eye, Then rais'd thy solemn voice on high; Thy comment still his work pursues, The plan explains, the style reviews, And marks its strength, and marks its ease; And tells us why and how they please. And when, perhaps, disdaining care, He blends with faults his products fair; Whate'er of such thy sight surveys, Thy tongue in triumph ne'er displays, But hints, as spots that dim the sun, Or rocks that future sails should shun. 'Twas Thee whom once Stagyra's grove Oft with her Sage Aristotle. allur'd to rove; 'Twas Thee to whom in Tadmor's bowers, Her Statesman Longinus. vow'd his vacant hours; 'Twas Thee whom, Tibur's vines among, Her Bard Horace. in careless measures sung; 'Twas Thou who thence to Albion's plain Remov'd, to teach her tuneful train, When Dryden's age, by thee inspir'd, Condemn'd the flights his youth admir'd; And Pope, intent on higher praise, So polish'd all his pleasing lays: And now, by Thee, our favour'd coast A Warton, Hurd, and Burke can boast; And Her, whose pen from Gallic rage Defended Shakespeare's injur'd page The ingenious Mrs. Montague, who has so ably vindicated Shakespeare from the cavils of Voltaire.. Give me, bright Power! with ready ear, Another's plea for fame to hear, And bid my willing voice allow The bays to Merit's modest brow: And when the Muse her presence deigns, And prompts my own unstudied strains, Instruct me them, with view severe, To inspect, and keep from error clear; Nor spare, though fancy'd e'er so fine, One ill-placed thought, or useless line. ODE XXIII. TO DISEASE. Disease! Man's dread, relentless foe, Fell source of fear, and pain, and woe! O say, on what ill-fated coast They mourn thy tyrant reign the most? On Java's bogs, or Gambia's sand, Or Persia's sultry southern strand; Or Egypt's annual-flooded plain, Or Rome's neglected, waste domain; Or where her walls Byzantium rears, And mosques and turrets crescent-crown'd, And from his high serail the sultan hears The wide Propontis' beating waves resound Byzantium: Constantinople; subject to frequent visitations of that dreadful fever, the plague.. I'll ask no moreâOur clime, tho' fair, Enough thy tyrant reign must share; And lovers there, and friends, complain, By Thee their friends and lovers slain: And yet our Avarice and our Pride Combine to spread thy mischiefs wide; While that the captive wretch confines, To hunger, cold, and filth resigns,â And this the funeral pomp attends To vaults, where mouldering corses lie,â Amid foul air thy form unseen ascends, And like a vulture hovers in the sky Alluding to the too frequent miserable situation of prisoners of war, debtors, &amp;c.; and the absurd custom of burying in churches; circumstances contributing greatly to the propagation of Disease.. ODE XXIV. THE TEMPESTUOUS EVENING. There's grandeur in this sounding storm, That drives the hurrying clouds along That on each other seem to throng, And mix in many a varied form; While, bursting now and then between, The Moon's dim misty orb is seen, And casts faint glimpses on the green. Beneath the blast the forests bend, And thick the branchy ruin lies, And wide the shower of foliage flies; The lake's black waves in tumult blend, Revolving o'er and o'er and o'er, And foaming on the rocky shore, Whose caverns echo to their roar. The sight sublime enrapts my thought, And swift along the past it strays, And much of strange event surveys, What History's faithful tongue has taught, Or Fancy form'd, whose plastic skill The page with fabled change can fill Of ill to good, or good to ill. But can my soul the scene enjoy, That rends another's breast with pain? O hapless he, who, near the main, Now sees its billowy rage destroy! Beholds the foundering bark descend, Nor knows, but what its fate may end The moments of his dearest friend! ODE XXV. THE MELANCHOLY EVENING. O haste, ye hovering clouds, away, Ye clouds so fleecy, dim, and pale, Thro' which the Moon's obstructed ray Sheds this sad whiteness o'er the vale! Forbear, ye bells, that languid strain! The sight, the sound, are fraught with pain; The words of dying friends I hear, The open grave I linger near, Take the last look, and drop the parting tear! Bestow my view dire phantoms rise, The plagues of hapless human-kind! Pale Fear, who unpursued still flies, And starts, and turns, and looks behind; Remorse, whose own indignant aim Deforms with useless wounds her frame; Despair, whose tongue no speech will deign, Whose ghastly brow looks dark disdain, And bends from steep rocks o'er the foaming main. And Rage, whose bosom inly burns, While Reason's call he scorns to hear; And Jealousy, who ruthless turns From suppliant Beauty's prayer and tear; Revenge, whose thoughts tumultuous roll To seek the poniard or the bowl; And Phrensy, wildly passing by, With her chain'd arm and starting eye, And voice that with loud curses rends the sky! Ambition, here, to heights of power His course with daring step pursues, Tho' Danger's frown against him lour, Tho' Guilt his path with blood bestrews; There Avarice grasps his useless store, Tho' Misery's plaints his aid implore, Tho' he, her ruin'd cottage nigh, Beholds her famish'd infants lie, And hears their faint, their last expiring cry! Ye dreadful band! O spare, O spare! Alas, your ear no prayers persuade! But, ah! if Man your reign must bear, Sure Man had better ne'er been made! Say, will Religion clear this gloom, And point to bliss beyond the tomb? Yes, haply for her chosen train; The rest, they say, severe decrees ordain To realms of endless night, and everlasting pain The Author does not give these as his own sentiments, but merely such as the gloomy moment described might naturally suggest. That the above dreadful idea is adopted by a large body of Christians, is sufficient to authorise its admission into a Poem professing to paint the dark side of things.! ODE XXVI. THE PLEASANT EVENING. Delightful looks this clear, calm sky, With Cynthia's silver orb on high; Delightful looks this smooth green ground, With shadows cast from cots around: Quick-twinkling lustre decks the tide; And chearful radiance gently falls On that white town, and castle walls, That crown the spacious river's further side. And now along the echoing hills The night-bird's strain melodious trills; And now the echoing dale along Soft flows the shepherd's tuneful song: And now, wide o'er the water borne, The city's mingled murmur swells, And lively change of distant bells, And varied warbling of the deep-ton'd horn. Their influence calms the soften'd soul, The passions feel their strong controul: While Fancy's eye, where'er it strays, A scene of happiness surveys; Thro' all the various walks of life No natural ill nor moral sees, No Famine fell, nor dire Disease, Nor War's infernal unrelenting strife. For these, behold a heavenly band Their white wings waving o'er the land! Sweet Innocence, a cherub fair; And Peace and Joy, a sister pair: And Kindness mild, their kindred Grace, Whose brow serene complacence wears, Whose hand her liberal bounty bears O'er the vast range of animated space! Blest vision! O for ever stay! O far be Guilt and Pain away! And yet, perhaps, with Him, whose view Looks at one glance creation through, To general good our partial ill Seems but a sand upon the plain, Seems but a drop amid the main, And some wise unknown purpose may fulfil. ODE XXVII. AFTER READING AKENSIDE'S POEMS. To Fancy's view what visions rise, Remote amid yon azure skies! What Goddess-form descends in air? The Grecian Muse, severely fair! What Sage is he, to whom she deigns Her lyre of elevated strains? The Bard of Tyneâhis master hand Awakes new music o'er the land; And much his voice of right and wrong Attempts to teach the unheeding throng. What mean those chrystal rocks serene, Those laureate groves for ever green, Those Parian domes?âSublime retreats, Of Freedom's sons the happy seats!â There dwell the Few who dared disdain The lust of power and lust of gain; The Patriot names of old renown'd, And those in later ages found; The Athenian, Spartan, Roman boast, The pride of Britain's sea-girt coast! But, oh! what darkness intervenes! But, oh! beneath, what different scenes! What Matron she, to grief resign'd, Beside that ruin'd arch reclin'd? Her sons, who once so well could wield The warrior-spear, the warrior-shield, A turban'd Ruffian's scourge constrains To toil on desolated plains!â And She who leans that column nigh, Where trampled arms and eagles lie; Whose veil essays her blush to hide, Who checks the tear that hastes to glide? A mitred Priest's oppressive sway She sees her drooping race obey: Their vines unprun'd, their fields untill'd, Their streets with want and misery fill'd. And who is She, the Martial Maid Along that cliff so careless laid, Whose brow such laugh unmeaning wears, Whose eye such insolence declares, Whose tongue descants, with scorn so vain, On slaves of Ebro or of Seine? What griesly Churl Avarice., what Harlot bold Luxury., Behind her, chains enormous hold? Tho' Virtue's warning voice be near, Alas, she will not, will not hear! And now she sinks in sleep profound, And now they bind her to the ground. O what is He, his ghastly form, So half obscur'd in cloud and storm, Swift striding on Ruin.?âbeneath his strides Proud Empire's firmest base subsides; Behind him dreary wastes remain, Oblivion's dark chaotic reign! THE MEXICAN PROPHECY: AN ODE. DE SOLIS, in his History of the Conquest of Mexico, informs us, that, on the approach of Cortez to the neighbourhood of that city, the Emperor Motezuma sent a number of magicians to attempt the destruction of the Spanish army. As the sorcerers were practising their incantations, a dÃ¦mon appeared to them in the form of their idol Tlcatlepuca, and foretold the fall of the Mexican empire. On this legend is founded the following Poem. The conquest of Mexico was undertaken from motives of avarice, and accompanied with circumstances of cruelty; but it produced the subversion of a tyrannical government, and the abolition of a detestable religion of horrid rites and human sacrifices. From Cholula's hostile plain Cholula was a large city, not far distant from Mexico. The inhabitants were in league with the Mexicans; and after professing friendship for the Spaniards, endeavoured to surprise and destroy them., Left her treacherous legions slain, Left her temples all in flame, Cortes' conquering army came: High on Chalco's stormy steep Shone their phalanx broad and deep; High the Hispanian banner rais'd, Bore the Cross in gold emblaz'd The device on Cortes's standard was the Sign of the Cross. âVide De Solis.. Thick the gleaming spears appear'd, Loud the neighing steeds were heard; Flash'd the musquets lightnings round, Roll'd their thunders o'er the ground, Echo'd from a thousand caves, Down to Tenustitan's waves Tenustitan, otherwise Tenuchtitlan, the ancient name of the Lake of Mexico.;â Spacious lake, that far below Bade its lucid level flow: There the ever-sunny shore Groves of palm and coco bore; Maize-fields rich, savannas green, Stretch'd around, with towns between. TacubÃ , TezeÃ¹co fair, Rear'd their shining roofs in air; Mexico's imperial pride Glitter'd 'midst the glassy tide, Bright with gold, with silver bright, Dazzling, charming all the sight The Spanish historians assert, that the walls and houses of the Indian cities were composed of a peculiar kind of glittering stone or plaster, which at a distance resembled silver.. From their post the war-worn band Raptur'd view'd the happy land: âHaste to victory, haste to ease, âMark the spot that gives us these!â On the exulting heroes strode, Shunn'd the smooth insidious road, Shunn'd the rock's impending shade, Shunn'd the expecting ambuscade The Indians had blocked up the usual road to Mexico, and opened another broader, and smooth at the entrance, but which led among rocks and precipices, where they had placed parties in ambush. Cortes discovered the stratagem, and ordered his troops to remove the obstructions. Being asked by the Mexican ambassadors the reason of this procedure, he replied, that the Spaniards always chose to encounter difficulties.. Deep within a gloomy wood Motezume's magicians stood: TlcÃ tlepÃ¹ca's horrid form, God of famine, plague, and storm, High on magic stones they rais'd; Magic fires before him blaz'd; Round the lurid flames they drew, Flames whence steams of sulphur flew; There, while bleeding victims smok'd, Thus his aid they loud invok'd: âMinister supreme of ill, âPrompt to punish, prompt to kill, âMotezuma asks thy aid! âForeign foes his realms invade; âVengeance on the strangers shed, âMix them instant with the dead! âBy thy temple's sable floor, âBy thy altar stain'd with gore, âStain'd with gore and strew'd with bones, âEchoing shrieks, and echoing groans! âVengeance on the strangers shed, âMix them instant with the dead!â Ordaz heard, Velasquez heardâ Swift their fauchions' blaze appear'd; Alvarado rushing near, Furious rais'd his glittering spear; Calm, Olmedo mark'd the scene Bartholeme de Olmedo, chaplain to Cortes: he seems to have been a man of enlarged ideas, much prudence, moderation, and humanity., Calm he mark'd, and stepp'd between: âVain their rites and vain their prayer, âWeak attempts beneath your care; âWarriors! let the wretches live! âChristians! pity, and forgive!â Sudden darkness o'er them spread, Glow'd the woods with dusky red; Vast the Idol's stature grew, Look'd his face of ghastly hue, Frowning rage, and frowning hate, Angry at his nation's fate; Fierce his fiery eyes he roll'd, Thus his tongue the future told; Cortes' veterans paus'd to hear; Wondering all, tho' void of fear: âMourn, devoted city, mourn! âMourn, devoted city, mourn! âDoom'd for all thy crimes to know âScenes of battle, scenes of woe! âWho is heâO spare the sight!â âRob'd in gold, with jewels bright? âHark! he deigns the crowd to call; âChiefs and warriors prostrate fall Motezuma, who was resident in the Spanish quarters when they were attacked by the Mexicans, proposed shewing himself to the people, in order to appease the tumult. At his first appearance, he was regarded with veneration, which was soon exchanged for rage, to the effects whereof he fell a victim.. âReverence now to fury yields; âStrangers o'er him spread your shields! âThick the darts, the arrows, fly; âHapless Monarch! he must die! âMark the solemn funeral state âPassing thro' the western gate! âChÃ pultÃ¨qua's cave contains âMighty Motezume's remains. âCease the strife! alas, 'tis vain! âMyriads throng Otumba's plain; âWide their feathery crests they wave, âAll the strong and all the brave Cortes, in his retreat from Mexico, after the death of Motezuma, was followed and surrounded by the whole collective force of the empire, in the plains of Otumba. After repelling the attacks of his enemies, on every side, with indefatigable valour, he found himself overpowered by numbers; when, making one desperate effort, with a few select friends, he seized the imperial standard, killed the general, and routed the army.. âGleaming glory thro' the skies, âSee the Imperial standard flies! âDown by force resistless torn; âOff in haughty triumph borne. âSlaughter heaps the vale with dead, âFugitives the mountains spread. âMexico, 'tis thine to know âMore of battle, more of woe!â âBright in arms the stranger train âO'er thy causeways move again. âBend the bow, the shaft prepare, âJoin the breastplate's folds with care; âRaise the sacrificial fire, âBid the captive youths expire De Solis relates, that the Mexicans sacrificed to their idols a number of Spaniards, whom they had taken prisoners, and whose cries and groans were distinctly heard in the Spanish camp, exciting sentiments of horror and revenge in their surviving companions.; âWake the sacred trumpet's breath, âPouring anguish, pouring death The above author observes, that the Sacred Trumpet of the Mexicans was so called, because it was not permitted to any but the priests to sound it; and that only when they denounced war, and animated the people on the part of their gods.; âTroops from every street repair, âClose them in the fatal snare; âValiant as they are, they fly, âHere they yield, and there they die. âCease the strife! 'tis fruitless all, âMexico at last must fall! âLo! the dauntless band return, âFurious for the fight they burn! âLo! auxiliar nations round, âCrowding o'er the darken'd ground! âCorses fill thy trenches deep; âDown thy temple's lofty steep âSee thy priests, thy princes thrownâ âHark! I hear their parting groan! âBlood thy Lake with crimson dyes, âFlames from all thy domes arise! âWhat are those that round thy shore âLaunch thy troubled waters o'er? âSwift canoes that from the fight âAid their vanquish'd monarch's flight; âAmbush'd in the reedy shade, âThem the stranger barks invade; âSoon thy lord a captive bends, âSoon thy far-fam'd empire ends When the Spaniards had forced their way to the centre of Mexico, Guatimozin, the reigning emperor, endeavoured to escape in his canoes across the Lake; but was pursued and taken prisoner by Garcia de Holguin, captain of one of the Spanish brigantines.; âOtomÃ¨ca shares thy spoils, âTlÃ scalÃ  in triumph smiles The Otomies were a fierce, savage nation, never thoroughly subdued by the Mexicans. Tlascala was a powerful neighbouring republic, the rival of Mexico.. âMourn, devoted city, mourn! âMourn, devoted city, mourn! âCease your boast, O stranger band, âConquerors of my fallen land! âAvarice strides your van before, âPhantom meagre, pale, and hoar! âDiscord follows, breathing flame, âStill opposing claim to claim Alluding to the dissensions which ensued among the Spaniards, after the conquest of America.; âKindred DÃ¦mons haste along! âHaste, avenge my country's wrong!â Ceas'd the voice with dreadful sounds, Loud as tides that burst their bounds; Roll'd the form in smoke away, Amaz'd on earth th' exorcists lay; Pondering on the dreadful lore, Their course the Iberians downward bore; Their helmets glittering o'er the vale, And wide their ensigns fluttering in the gale. EPISTLES. EPISTLE I. THE GARDEN. TO A FRIEND. From Whitby's rocks steep rising o'er the main, From Eska's vales, or Ewecot's lonely plain, Say, rove thy thoughts to Amwell's distant bow'rs, To mark how pass thy Friend's sequester'd hours? âPerhaps, 'think'st thou, âhe seeks his pleasing scenes âOf winding walks, smooth lawns, and shady greens: âWhere China's willow hangs its foliage fair, âAnd Po's tall poplar waves its top in air, âAnd the dark maple spreads its umbrage wide, âAnd the white bench adorns the bason side; âAt morn reclin'd, perhaps, he sits to view âThe bank's neat slope, the water's silver hue. âWhere, 'midst thick oaks, the subterraneous way âTo the arch'd grot admits a feeble ray; âWhere glossy pebbles pave the varied floors, âAnd rough flint-walls are deck'd with shells and ores, âAnd silvery pearls, spread o'er the roofs on high, âGlimmer like faint stars in a twilight sky; âFrom noon's fierce glare, perhaps, he pleas'd retires, âIndulging musings which the place inspires. âNow where the airy octagon ascends, âAnd wide the prospect o'er the vale extends, â'Midst evening's calm, intent perhaps he stands, âAnd looks o'er all that length of sun-gilt lands, âOf bright green pastures, stretch'd by rivers clear, âAnd willow groves, or osier islands near.â Alas, my friend, how strangely men mistake, Who guess what others most their pleasure make! These garden scenes, which Fashion o'er our plains Spreads round the villas of our wealthy swains, Tho' Envy grudge, or Friendship wish to share, They claim but little of their owners' care. For me, my groves not oft my steps invite, And far less oft they fail to offend my sight: In vain the senna waves its glossy gold, In vain the cistus' spotted flowers unfold, In vain the acacia's snowy bloom depends, In vain the sumach's scarlet spike ascends, In vain the woodbine's spicy tufts disclose, And green slopes redden with the shedding rose: These neat-shorn hawthorns useless verdant bound, This long straight walk, that pool's unmeaning round, These short-curv'd paths that twist beneath the trees, Disgust the eye, and make the whole displease. âNo scene like this,â I say, âdid Nature raise, âBrown's fancy form, or Walpole's See Mr. Walpole's ingenious History of the Modern Taste in Gardening, at the end of the Fourth Volume of his Anecdotes of Painting. judgment praise; âNo prototype for this did I survey âIn Woollett's landscapes The above-named excellent Artist, several years ago, drew and engraved a number of beautiful views in some of our most celebrated modern gardens., or in Mason's lay.â But might thy genius, Friend, an Eden frame, Profuse of beauty, and secure from blame; Where round the lawn might wind the varied way, Now lost in gloom, and now with prospect gay; Now screen'd with clumps of green, for wintry bow'rs; Now edg'd with sunny banks, for summer flow'rs; Now led by chrystal lakes with lilies drest, Or where light temples court the step to restâ Time's gradual change, or Tempest's sudden rage, There with thy peace perpetual war would wage. That tyrant oak, whose arms so far o'ergrow, Shades some poor shrub that pines with drought below; These rampant elms, those hazels branching wide, Crowd the broad pine, the spiry larix hide. That lilac brow, where May's unsparing hand Bade one vast swell of purple bloom expand, Soon past its prime, shews signs of quick decay, The naked stem, and scanty-cover'd spray. Fierce Boreas calls, and Ruin waits his call; Thy fair catalpa's broken branches fall; Thy soft magnolia mourns her blasted green, And blighted laurel's yellowing leaves are seen. But Discontent alone, thou'lt say, complains For ill success, where none perfection gains: True is the charge; but from that tyrant's sway What art, what power, can e'er redeem our day? To me, indeed, short ease he sometimes yields, When my lone walk surrounds the rural fields; There no past errors of my own upbraid, No time, no wealth, expended unrepaid: There Nature dwells, and throws profuse around Each pastoral sight and every pastoral sound; From Spring's green copse, that pours the cuckoo's strain, And evening bleatings of the fleecy train, To Autumn's yellow field, and clamorous horn There is a custom, frequent in many parts of England, of calling the harvest-men to and from work by the sound of a horn. This practice, as well as that of the Harvest-Shouting, seems much on the decline. The latter could boast its origin from high antiquity, as appears from that beautiful stroke of Eastern Poetry, Isaiah, chap. xvi: âI will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouting for thy summer fruits, and for thy harvest, is fallen!â That wakes the slumbering harvesters at morn. There Fancy too, with fond delighted eyes, Sees o'er the scene ideal people rise; There calm Contentment, in his cot reclin'd, Hears the grey poplars whisper in the wind; There Love's sweet song adown the echoing dale To Beauty's ear conveys the tender tale; And there Devotion lifts his brow to Heaven, With grateful thanks for many a blessing given. Thus oft thro' Maylan's shady lane I stray, Trace Rushgreen's paths, or Postwood's winding way; Thus oft to Eastfield's airy height I haste; (All well-known spots thy feet have frequent trac'd!) While Memory, as my sight around I cast, Suggests the pleasing thought of moments past; Or Hope, amid the future, forms again The dream of bliss Experience broke in vain. EPISTLE II. WINTER AMUSEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY. TO A FRIEND IN LONDON. While Thee, my Friend, the City's scenes detain,â The chearful scenes where Trade and Pleasure reign; Where glittering shops their varied stores display, And passing thousands crowd the public way; Where Painting's forms and Music's sounds delight, And Fashion's frequent novelties invite, And Conversation's sober social hours Engage the mind, and elevate its powersâ Far different scenes for us the country yields, Deserted roads and unfrequented fields: Yet deem not, lonely as they are, that these Boast nought to charm the eye, the ear to please. Tho' here the Tyrant Winter holds command, And bids rude tempests desolate the land; Sometimes the Sun extends his chearing beam, And all the landscape casts a golden gleam: Clear is the sky, and calm and soft the air, And thro' thin mist each object looks more fair. Then, where the villa rears its sheltering grove, Along the southern lawn 'tis sweet to rove: There dark green pines, behind, their boughs extend, And bright spruce firs like pyramids ascend, And round their tops, in many a pendent row, Their scaly cones of shining auburn show; There the broad cedar's level branches spread, And the tall cypress lifts its spiry head; With alaternus ilex interweaves, And laurels mix their glossy oval leaves; And gilded holly crimson fruit displays, And white viburnum That well-known beautiful flowering evergreen, commonly called Laurustinus. o'er the border strays. Where these from storms the spacious greenhouse screen, Ev'n now the eye beholds a flow'ry scene; There chrystal sashes ward the injurious cold, And rows of benches fair exotics hold; Rich plants, that Afric's sunny cape supplies, Or o'er the isles of either India rise. While strip'd geranium shows its tufts of red, And verdant myrtles grateful fragrance shed; A moment stay to mark the vivid bloom, A moment stay to catch the high perfume, And then to rural scenesâYon path, that leads Down the steep bourn and 'cross the level meads, Soon mounts the opponent hill, and soon conveys To where the farm its pleasing group displays: The rustic mansion's form, antiquely fair; The yew-hedg'd garden, with its grass-plat square; The barn's long ridge, and doors expanded wide; The stable's straw-clad eves and clay-built side; The cartshed's roof, of rough-hewn roundwood made, And loose on heads of old sere pollards laid; The granary's floor that smooth-wrought posts sustain, Where hungry vermin strive to climb in vain; And many an ash that wild around them grows, And many an elm that shelter o'er them throws. Then round the moat we turn, with pales inclos'd, And 'midst the orchard's trees in rows dispos'd, Whose boughs thick tufts of misletoe adorn With fruit of lucid white on joints of yellow borne. Thence up the lane, romantic woods among, Beneath old oaks with ivy overhung (O'er their rough trunks the hairy stalks intwine, And on their arms the sable berries shine): Here oft the sight, on banks bestrewn with leaves, The early primrose' opening bud perceives; And oft steep dells or ragged cliffs unfold The prickly furze with bloom of brightest gold; Here oft the red-breast hops along the way, And 'midst grey moss explores his insect prey; Or the green woodspite The Green Woodpecker. âVide Pennant's British Zoology, folio, p. 78. flies with outcry shrill, And delves the sere bough with his sounding bill; Or the rous'd hare starts rustling from the brake, And gaudy jays incessant clamour make; Or echoing hills return from stubbles nigh The sportsman's gun, and spaniel's yelping cry. And now the covert ends in open ground, That spreads wide views beneath us all around; There turbid waters, edg'd with yellow reeds, Roll thro' the russet herd-forsaken meads; There from the meads th' inclosures sloping rise, And, 'midst th' inclosures, dusky woodland lies; While pointed spires and curling smokes, between, Mark towns and vills and cottages unseen. And now,âfor now the breeze and noontide ray Clear the last remnants of the mist away,â Far, far o'er all extends the aching eye, Where azure mountains mingle with the sky: To these the curious optic tube applied Reveals each object distance else would hide; There seats or homesteads, plac'd in pleasant shades, Show their white walls and windows thro' the glades; There rears the hamlet church its hoary tow'r (The clock's bright index points the passing hour); There green-rob'd huntsmen o'er the sunny lawn Lead home their beagles from the chace withdrawn, And ploughs slow-moving turn the broad champaign, And on steep summits feed the fleecy train. But wintry months few days like these supply, And their few moments far too swiftly fly: Dank thaws, chill fogs, rough winds, and beating rain, To sheltering rooms th' unwilling step detain; Yet there, my Friend, shall liberal Science find Amusement various for th' inquiring mind. While History's hand her sanguine record brings, With woes of nations fraught, and crimes of kings; Plague thins the street, and Famine blasts the plain, War wields his sword, Oppression binds his chain; Curiosity pursues the unfolding tale, Which Reason blames, and Pity's tears bewail. While Fancy's powers the eventful novel frame, And Virtue's care directs its constant aim; As Fiction's pen domestic life portrays, Its hopes and fears and joys and griefs displays; By Grandison's or Clinton's Vide The Fool of Quality, a well-known novel, by Mr. Henry Brooke, author of Gustavus Vasa, &amp;c. story mov'd, We read delighted, and we rise improv'd. Then with bold Voyagers our thought explores Vast tracts of ocean and untrodden shores; Now views rude climes, where ice-rocks drear aspire, Or red volcanos shoot their streams of fire: Now seeks sweet isles, where lofty palm-groves wave, And cany banks translucent rivers lave; Where Plenty's gifts luxuriant load the soil, And Ease reposes, charm'd with Beauty's smile. Such, hapless Cook This celebrated Circumnavigator, after surmounting numerous difficulties, and escaping many dangers, was at length slain by the inhabitants of Owhyhee, a little island in the Pacific Ocean.! amid the southern main, Rose thy Ta-heitÃ¨'s peaks and flowery plain;â Why, daring Wanderer! quit that blissful land, To seek new dangers on a barbarous strand? Why doom'd, so long escap'd from storms and foes, Upon that strand thy dying eyes to close; Remote each place by habit render'd dear, Nor British friends nor Otaheitean near? Nor less than books the Engraver's works invite, Where past and distant come before the sight; Where, all the Painter's lively tints convey'd, The skilful Copyist gives in light and shade: While faithful views the prospect's charms display, From coast to coast, and town to town, we stray; While faithful portraits human features trace, We gaze delighted on the speaking face; Survey the port that bards and heroes bore, Or mark the smiles that high-born beauties wore. Cease these to please? Philosophy attends With arts where knowledge with diversion blends; The Sun's vast system in a model shows; Bids the clear lens new forms to sight expose; Constructs machines, whose wond'rous powers declare The effects of light, and properties of air; With whirling globes excites electric fires, And all their force and all their use inquires. O Nature! how immense thy secret store, Beyond what ev'n a Priestley can explore! Such, Friend, the employments may his time divide, Whom rural shades from scenes of business hide; While o'er his ear unnotic'd glide away The noise and nonsense of the passing day A short Epistle, partly on the same plan as the foregoing, was, some years ago, inadvertently suffered to appear in a Collection of Poems, by Several Hands, published by G. Pearch.âSuch lines of that Piece, as were thought worth preservation, are here retained.! AN ESSAY ON PAINTING. The Author had conceived a design of writing a pretty extensive Poem on the subject of Painting, long before Mr. Hayley's ingenious âPoetical Epistle to an Eminent Painterâ appeared. That performance anticipated and precluded part of his intended Work, but seemed not to render the suppression of the following Lines necessary. TO A YOUNG ARTIST. From sunny Adria's sea-surrounded towers, From Tyber's vales and Arno's viny bowers, The Muse of Painting seeks Britannia's plain, And leads to Thames's bank her favourite train: There, where a nation's wealth her dome has plac'd, With her kind Sister's Architecture. Attic beauties grac'd, She, like the Spring, as liberal and as gay, Bids her rich hand its annual stores display; And mimic Being glowing round the walls, From scene to scene the rapt attention calls. There, where the Public gives the palm of praise, And only Merit to renown can raise, Doubtless, my Friend, the just ambition's thine To see thy future works distinguish'd shine. Hear then thy Poet's monitory lay, That hints not useless may perchance convey: No artist I, like Him of Gallia's shore C.A. Du Fresnoy, a well-known French Painter; author of a Latin poem, De Arte Graphica., Whose pencil practis'd, ere he taught his lore; Yet Taste incites me others' works to view, And risk a judgment haply not untrue. Were Painting's path my pleasing road to fame, The choice of subject much my care should claim; His graphic power he sure but ill bestows, Who best a trifle's nice resemblance shows. Tho' the rich tints so finely blended fall, When carps and pheasants deck the rural hall, That oft, like Zeuxis' grapes, they scarcely fail To tempt to touch the feather or the scale,â Yet not ev'n Elmer's The Author must here once for all remark, that whatever he may say respecting the works of any Painter is solely the result of impartial, though possibly mistaken opinion. He cannot be misled by friendship; for, excepting a slight acquaintance with those amiable characters, Mr. West and Mrs. Kauffman, he has not the pleasure of knowing any Artist whose name he has taken the liberty to mention. skill can make us prize What every field or every pond supplies; Regret gives pain to view such wonderous art Tried on no theme that interests the heart. The pride of Genius should thy hand restrain From all that Life's inferior ranks contain This is meant only of such objects, when considered as the principal subject of a picture. Almost every class of animals may be occasionally introduced as ornaments in landscape, and often in history.; Thy conscious pallet ne'er its hues should spare To draw a sportsman's hound or racer's mare; Nor thy reluctant crayon stoop to trace A fool's dull eye, or villain's ill-mark'd face. But deem not Portrait's gifts I mean to slight,â Portrait, the source of many a pure delight! When Bards' or Sages' works our wishes fire To see their forms whose minds we there admire, The featur'd canvas full to view displays Reason's deep calm or Fancy's glowing rays. When Beauty's charms their varied graces wear, Love's gentle smile, or Mirth's vivacious air, The pleasing image strikes remotest climes, And goes unalter'd down to distant times. When Death's relentless hand in dust has laid The school-companion, or the first-lov'd maid; The father kind, with filial awe rever'd; The tender mother, by her cares endear'd; When from our arms the darling child is torn, Or when the husband or the wife we mournâ As on their picture many a glance we cast, Remembrance wanders to the vanish'd past; Our thoughts o'er numberless minutiÃ¦ roll, And pain-mix'd pleasure solaces the soul. To Portrait's study should thy choice incline, Ev'n there to aim at excellence be thine; And strive to reach the point that few can gain, Preserve the likeness, yet the spirit retain. Of Landscape's province wide extends the range, From the deep vale and humble rural grange, To Cambrian heaths sublimely brown and bare That celebrated artist, Mr. Wilson, has painted a set of beautiful Views from Nature, in different parts of Wales., Or Alpine ice-points glittering white in air: And not from Nature only she designs, But different parts of different scenes combines; Or new creations of her own she forms, Illumes with sunshine, or involves in storms These circumstances, termed by the Painters Accidents of Nature, often agreeably diversify landscape.. Familiar prospects would thy hand bestow? Mark what our hay-fields and our hop-grounds show; Where in neat rows the russet cocks are seen, Or from tall poles depend festoons of green; And long straight paths in perspective extend, And yellow sandhills close behind ascend For this imagery the Author is indebted to Mr. Walpole, who, in his Anecdotes of Painting, vol. iv. p. 65, proposes our hay-fields and hop-grounds as new subjects of landscape.. Nor sweeter contrast sure can meet the eye Than village lanes in vernal months supply, When amber clouds, in sky of soft bright blue, Hang o'er the copse just crown'd with verdure new; Or where the orchard's sun-gilt branches spread Their bloom of white or faintly-blushing red. The fairest scenes, when peopled, look more fair, But these to people asks peculiar care: We wish not here for Virgil's classic swains, Nor Dryad nymphs light tripping o'er the plains; Nor yet the grinning Hobbinols of Gay, Nor cottage Marians in their torn array: The rustic life, in every varied place, Can boast its few of beauty and of grace; From them select the forms that most may please, And clothe with simple elegance and ease: Such forms in Smith's The late Mr. George Smith of Chichester. delightful spots we prize, And such in Sandby's pleasant fields arise. The observant Artist much from travel gains; Increase of knowledge well rewards his pains. Now his pleas'd eye o'er Tuscan prospects roves, Their sunny corn-fields and their cypress groves; Their roads, where sports from tree to tree the vine, And thro' broad leaves its chrystal clusters shine The hedgerow trees in Tuscany are covered with vines. âVide Smollet's Travels, vol. ii. p. 46.; Their white Casines, with olive groves around; And glittering cliffs with towns and castles crown'd. Now his pleas'd step a wider circuit tries, Where Nile's vast flood on Egypt's level lies; While 'midst the tide tall palms their tops uprear, And causeways broad and cities fair appear Vide Rollin's Ancient History, 18mo. vol. i. p. 22.. Now Indian climes he east or west explores, Quits the dull factory and the sandy shores Several of our Artists have attended to this circumstance of foreign scenery. The ingenious Mr. George Robertson has painted several fine romantic Views in Jamaica, which have been engraved., Climbs craggy hills, pervades romantic woods, Or winds along the cataracts of the floods; Thro' beasts and birds and insects, fruits and flow'rs, In shape and colour all distinct from ours; Or strays o'er isles that spicy vales unfold, 'Midst skies of glory and 'midst seas of gold; Such skies, such seas, as Hodges' pencil drew, And round the rocks of Ulitea threw Several beautiful Landscapes, taken in different parts of the New Discovered Islands, by Mr. Hodges, who attended Captain Cook in one of his Voyages, must be well remembered by those who attend the annual Exhibitions of the Royal Academy.. Whate'er we copy, or whate'er we feign, Thro' all the piece one character should reign: When Claude's bright morn on Mola's precincts dawns, What sweet quiescence marks the groves and lawns! How calm his herds among the ruins graze! How calm his curious peasant stands to gaze Vide a beautiful Engraving, by Vivarez, from a capital Picture of Claude Lorrain, called the Morning, in which he introduces himself drawing an antique temple on the banks of the Tyber, between Ponte Mola and Rome.! When bold Salvator under turbid skies Bids his scath'd hills and blasted trees arise, Behind wild rocks bids his wild streams be lost, And from vast cliffs shews broken fragments tost; 'Midst them no shepherds lead their flocks along, Nor village maidens seem to tune their song; But solemn augurs flights of birds survey, Or stern-eyed robbers wait the passing prey Vide Salvator Rosa's Landscapes, engraved by Goupy. See also Sir Joshua Reynolds's Discourses, p. 175.. In Rubens' forest, when the wounded boar, Plung'd in the stream, attempts the further shore, How the fierce dogs retard his aukward speed! How the fierce hunters urge the staining steed! And eager one the winged arrow sends, And one firm-fix'd the expectant spear protends Vide Rubens's Landscape of boar-hunting, engraved by Bolswert.. To History's group, where passion'd thought exprest Strikes kindred feelings on the gazer's breast,â To History's group, the epic of thy art, Proceed we now, and what we can, impart. The mighty Masters of Italian name All Rome, all Florence, and Bologna claim; Whose fresco forms still animate their walls, Whose living canvas decks their domes and halls: What various powers for these their glory won, And what of theirs to chuse, and what to shun, Illustrious Reynolds much in prose has told, And more my verse pretends not to unfold. These still thy study but with caution make, Nor prize the picture for the Painter's sake; Raffaelle himself, beneath himself oft fell, And meaner hands' best works his worst excel For this assertion the Author has the highest authority, viz. that of Sir Joshua Reynolds. âI have no desire,â says he, âto degrade Raffaelle from the high rank he deservedly holds; but, in comparing him with himself, he does not appear to me to be the same man in Oil as in Fresco.ââDiscourses, p. 165.. 'Tis General Nature, in thy art and mine, Must give our fame in future times to shine: Sublime and pathos, like the Sun's fix'd flame, Remain, and please thro' every age the same; Humour's light shapes, like vapours in the sky, Rise, pass, and vary, and for ever fly: Hogarth and Swift, if living, might deplore Half their keen jokes, that now are jokes no more. What Truth's rich page of real event supplies, What Fancy's powers of fabled act devise, Before thee lieâbut where the field so wide, There Judgment's hand Selection's step must guide. To Horror's forms the mind aversion feels, To Spaniolet's Gioseppe Ribera, a native of Valencia in Spain. He was noted for painting horrid subjects; such as Prometheus with the Vulture feeding on his liver; Ixion tortured on the wheel; and St. Bartholomew with the skin flayed from his body. âVide Dryden's Translation of Fresnoy, p. 352. flay'd saints and torturing wheels; Nor praise for nauseous images we win, For Spenser's Error, or for Milton's Sin. Mythology, that Greek enchantress, long Has reign'd the idol of the painting throng: But Reason's thought disdains Ovidian dreams Absurd, of nymphs transform'd to trees and streams; And Virtue Homer's wanton gods abhors, With all their lewd amours and all their idle wars. The Battle's conflicts ample scope bestow The effects of fury, fear, and pain to show; As different features these unlike express, The contrast's force affects us more or less. But here Confusion holds his crowded reign, And the tir'd eye attempts to rest in vain; And o'er the scene Humanity complains, Where mangled corses lie, and blood the land distains. When in the fore-ground kings or generals stand, Direct the attack, or head the charging band, Their graceful forms we unconcern'd survey, Who fight for conquest, or who fight for pay: Nor in their postures can there much be prais'd, Their pistols levell'd, or their fauchions rais'd; And to dull sameness here so oft we fall, That who beholds one piece, beholds them all. But War's dire field, not all confin'd to these, Affords us often incidents that please: For oft the Historian's, oft the Poet's art, Can win our wishes on some hero's part; His country nam'd, his place and parents known, Our busy thought his perils makes its own. To fierce Pelides, 'midst Scamander's waves, When young Lycaon's voice for pity craves Vide the Iliad, book xxi.âThis story of Lycaon is perhaps one of the most affecting passages in the whole Poem. Vide Pope's Note, vol. v. p. 208. of his Translation. The countenance of Achilles, at the moment when the death of Patroclus, occurring to his thought, determined him to kill Lycaon, would afford a fine expression: âTalk not of life or ransom, he replies; âPatroclus dead, whoever meets me dies.â; The Chief's stern brow, and lance suspended high, The Youth's bent knee and deprecating eye, Not West's rich pencil need disdain to trace, Or Romney's stroke with glowing colours grace. When Dithyrambus, on OÃ«ta's plain, Mourns the brave Persian whom his hand has slain, Nor marks his danger from the approaching foe, Nor his bold friend prepar'd to ward the blow; In one what grief, in one what vengeful rage, In one what ardour, might the sight engage Vide Leonidas, book viii. l. 355. âHe ended, rushing furious on the Greek, âWho, while his gallant enemy expir'd, âWhile Hyperanthes tenderly receiv'd âThe last embraces of his gasping friend, âStood nigh reclin'd in sadness on his shield, âAnd in the pride of victory repin'd. âUnmark'd his foe approach'd. But forward sprung âDiomedon. Before the Thespian youth âAloft he rais'd his targe?â! The gentle Kauffman's traits can best declare The sentimental feelings of the Fair, When soft Erminia in the sylvan shade Leaves Tancred's name on every tree display'd Vide Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered.; Or kind Louisa pens the friendly scroll, To sooth the mournful sister of her soul See Emma Corbett, an interesting novel, by Mr. S. I. Pratt, Vol. i. Letter 34.. The same skill'd hand more strong expression tries, At Edward's feet when Woodville's daughter lies See the story of Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Sir Richard Woodville, suing to Edward IV. for restitution of her lands.â Rapin, vol. i. p. 601.; Or, 'midst the admiring weeping train around, Fond Eleanora sucks the poison'd wound The well-known story of Eleanor of Castile, queen of Edward I., sucking the poison from her husband's arm, when he was wounded by an assassin in Palestine.. Delightful Artist!âGrace her pencil guides, And Delicacy o'er its stroke presides! The immortal Swans, appointed to redeem Genius and Worth from Lethe's silent stream, Pleas'd with their charge shall bear her medall'd name To the fair Priestess of the fane of Fame See a Painting of Mrs. Kauffman's, from a passage in Ariosto, where swans are introduced bringing the names of ingenious persons, inscribed on medals, to a nymph who deposits them in the Temple of Fame.. Such tender subjects, if thy choice they gain, Enough for thee as yet untouch'd remain. Now from the page of Richardson bestow On Clementina's face the lines of woe; Or let sweet Harriet's livelier beauty wear The soul-fraught eye and apprehensive air; Or draw the proud Olivia's rage-flush'd charms, When the calm Hero seiz'd her deadly arms; And paint that Hero, firm in trial prov'd, Unaw'd by Danger, and by Vice unmov'd The History of Sir Charles Grandison, vol. iv. p. 176. The interview between Grandison and Olivia, at the instant of his seizing her poniard, would make a noble picture. This work of Richardson's abounds with fine situations. Brooke's Fool of Quality, and the Adventurer of Hawkesworth, are also books worthy the perusal of an artist who wishes for choice of interesting incidents.. To Sterne's soft Maniac let thy hand impart The languid cheek, the look that pierc'd his heart, When to her Virgin Saint the vesper song she rais'd, Or earnest view'd him as he sat and gaz'd This subject has been attempted by several ingenious artists, who have given very pleasing figures; but perhaps none that convey the precise idea of Sterne. This author being mentioned, a trite observation must be indulged, viz. That there probably never was a more striking instance of misapplication of talents than in him. With superior powers for the pathos, he chose to descend to ribaldry, that affronted the taste and corrupted the morals of the Public. What pity that the gold had not been separated from the dross, and the latter consigned to that oblivion it so richly merits!. Mark, if thou can'st, Philanthropy divine, That swells the breast and bids the features shine, When the tear glistening starts from Toby's eyes Fix'd on the couch where poor Le Fevre dies. The Grecian classics' venerable lore I see thee often diligent explore; What Homer's Muse to Chian cities taught, Or Pity's Priest Euripides; termed so by Collins. to Athens' audience brought. Methinks, now rising from thy plastic hand, Troy's hoary Monarch shall a suppliant stand; To stern Achilles all his griefs explain, And ask his Hector's corse, nor ask in vain Vide the Iliad, book xxiv.. Now Jove's kind Son to Thebes's sorrowing King Shall his restor'd unknown Alcestis bring; Admetus' eyes his anguish'd thoughts declare, And turn disgusted from the proffer'd Fair Vide the Alcestis of Euripides. Hercules restores to life Alcestis, the deceased wife of Admetus, and brings her to her husband, disguised with a veil, and represented as a stranger; whom Admetus, in the height of distress for the loss of his beloved consort, refuses to admit into his palace.. The Dark Sublime of extra-natural scenes The vulgar magic's puerile rite demeans; Where hags their caldrons fraught with toads prepare, Or glide on broomsticks thro' the midnight air. Chain'd on the rock let bold Prometheus lie, And cast wild looks, upbraiding, to the sky See the Prometheus of Ãschylus.; Bid Milton's Satan from the burning steep Call his wide legions, slumbering on the deep; Or Camoens' Spirit of the Cape upraise, And show him only by the lightning's blaze; Or place sad Hosier's Ghost amid the tide, Where by the pale Moon anchor'd navies ride See that admirable song, intitled Hosier's Ghost; by the Author of Leonidas.. O where is He, whose thought such grandeur gave To bold Fitzwalter and the barons brave, When, rang'd in arms along their Thames's strand, They snatch'd their charter from a tyrant's hand Vide the late Mr. Mortimer's Picture of King John delivering Magna Charta to the Barons. That ingenious Artist's obvious powers of imagination promised the attainment of a high degree of excellence in his profession.? Thro' all the scenes his rapid stroke bestow'd, Rosa's wild grace and daring spirit glow'd; In himâah lost ere half his powers were shown!â Britain perhaps an Angelo had known! Wouldst thou his honours emulous pursue, And give the Patriot Energy to view,â Deep in the gloom of Dalecarlia's mine, Bid Freedom's flame in Vasa's visage shine Brooke's Gustavus Vasa, act i. sc. 2. where Gustavus discovers himself to Anderson and Arnoldus in the copper-mines of Dalecarlia. See another fine subject in the same Tragedy, act iv. scene xi.; The pass of fam'd ThermopylÃ¦ display, And Sparta's Monarch's port august pourtray Vide Leonidas, book x. where the Hero of the Poem repeats to the assembled council the message of Argestes; while Alpheus, at the same instant, brings news of the Persians having passed the Upper Strait. This would make a noble picture; the dauntless appearance of the Greeks might be well contrasted with the fear and shame of the ambassador of Xerxes.âThe Banquet of Melissa, Priestess of the Muses, where Leonidas and Ãschylus are supposed present, book vii. is another fine subject. Such pictures would hardly be popular; but to some minds they would afford singular pleasure.. For Pontiffs and for Kings, the Painter's skill From Sacred Story toils their walls to fill; Where'er we turn, its subjects strike the eye, And few untried are left for us to try. Yet who has Jepthah's matchless woe exprest, By his lov'd Daughter's sudden sight distrest; Or shewn the Patriarchs, struck with wild amaze, As on the Viceroy's hidden cup they gaze The Author does not recollect seeing or hearing of any celebrated picture on those interesting subjects, of Jepthah's return, and the discovery of Joseph's cup in the sack of Benjamin.? Or who, when Israel's hosts on Edom's plain Despairing lie,âa thirst-afflicted train!â Has bade the Prophet and his minstrel stand, And call new waters o'er the burning sand Vide 2 Kings, chap. iii.âThis subject would afford a variety of noble expression in the different characters of the Kings, the pious confidence of Jehosaphat, and the desponding anxiety of Jehoram, the distress of the soldiers, and the enthusiasm of Elisha. The streams of water might appear in the distance, seemingly visible only to the Prophet, from his situation.? When David's chiefs, with generous thought inspir'd, Bring the clear wave his sickening soul desir'd; What dignity might to his act be given, The pure libation pouring out to Heaven 2 Samuel, chap. xxiii.! No more of Theme; Design must now succeedâ The mind's strong picture when we hear or read See Sir Joshua Reynolds's Discourses, p. 104., Where every person finds his proper place, And turn of attitude and turn of face: The Artist's powers in this must greatly fail, Whose figures point not out at once his tale âThat composition must be defective, which cannot, to a careful observer, point out its own tendency; and those expressions must be either weak or false, which do not in some degree mark the interest of each actor in the drama.â âWebb's Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting, preface, p. 8.. When Lystra's crowd around the Apostles throng, And joyful lead the victim ox along; Ask we the cause, while He that cause explains, Whose limb, late useless, strength and use obtains Vide Raffaelle's St. Paul and Barnabas at Lystra. For the above observation and description the Author is indebted to the ingenious âInquiry into the Beauties of Painting,â p. 180.? When West's young Warrior, bleeding on the ground, His mournful group of martial friends surround; Their gallant General instantly we know, Their griefs, their cares, his life's importance show; Quebec's proud tower, the encountering troops between, In distant view discriminates the scene Vide West's celebrated Picture of the Death of General Wolfe, engraved by Woollett.. As in the Drama all events should tend In course unbroken to the purpos'd end; So must the Picture's business still maintain The same connective unity of train. When Copley's Youth, swift-struggling thro' the wave, The anxious boatmen strain each nerve to save; As strives the ravenous shark to reach his prey, One lifts the javelin to arrest his way; And now, as near his dreadful jaws expand, One casts the cord, and one extends the hand: What care, what pity, mark their eager eyes! What hopes, what terrors, in our bosoms rise See Mr. Copley's Picture of a Youth rescued by Sailors from a Shark in the Harbour of the Havannah. There is a fine Mezzotinto of this Piece by Green.! The skilful Painter, at whose option lie Positions various, fails not all to try; And those prefers, where every part the best Accordance keeps, illustrating the rest. By different modes effect he oft obtains; To one Chief Figure now the attention gains; Now force on Second Characters bestows, And all his meaning by reflection shows; Now thro' the Whole, each rank, and sex, and age, One common ruling passion bids engage. When Raffaelle's Saviour from the tomb ascends, Such majesty and grace his presence blends, That the fix'd eye contemplates him alone, Nor heeds the astonish'd guards around him thrown Raffaelle's Picture of the Resurrection of Christ; engraved by Vivarez and Grignion from a Drawing of Dalton.. When Vandyke's General, whose victorious spear Sunk Persia's pride, and check'd the Goth's career, Of service paid with indigence complains, And sightless age on daily alms sustains; As the young Chief the affecting scene surveys, How all his form the emotion'd soul betrays! âO thus has Fortune for the brave decreed? âOf toils and dangers this at last the meed Vide the Belisarius of Vandyke; engraved by Goupy and Scotin.?â When Rome's fair Princess, who from Syria's shore Her late-lost Consort's sacred ashes bore, With steps slow-moving o'er Brundusium's strand, Meets her lov'd friendsâa numerous mourning bandâ Her gentle frame no gestures rude disgrace, No vulgar grief deforms her beauteous face; Her downcast eyes immoveable remain, Fix'd on the urn her careful hands sustain. The widow'd mother, by her garment's folds, Close on each side each tender offspring holds; While Melancholy all the train o'ershades Of hoary warriors and of blooming maids; And all their breasts with pity seem to heave, And for the dead and for the living grieve This capital Picture of Agrippina landing at Brundusium, with the ashes of Germanicus, is, in the Author's opinion, one of Mr. West's most pleasing compositions. There is a beautiful Print of it by Earlom.. The Great Sublime with energy to express Exert thy utmost power, nor fear excess. When Passion's tumults in the bosom rise, Inflate the features, and enrage the eyes; To Nature's outline can we draw too true, Or Nature's colours give too full to view? Did Reynolds' hand with force too strong disclose Those looks that mark the unutterable woes, When Ugoline the wretch in prison lies, And hears his dying children's piercing cries, And while fell Hunger haunts the impervious walls, And one by one the suffering victims calls, Invokes the lightning's bolt those walls to rend, Or earth to open, and his miseries end Vide Sir Joshua Reynolds's excellent Picture of Count Ugolino and his Children in the Dungeon; where they were confined and starved to death by the archbishop Ruggieri. This circumstance is described by the Italian poet DantÃ¨.? Our Bards indeed, I own, here often fail, And spoil with bombast and conceit their tale; Their heroes rant in many a curious strain Of thought, that none could think in anger or in pain. Celestial scenes with caution must be tried, Where Knowledge fails, and Fancy sole can guide: The Great First Cause no form reveals to sight, We mark his presence by excess of light The Author could not here omit censuring the practice of some celebrated Painters, who have presumptuously and absurdly represented the Supreme Being in the form of an Aged Man.; While angel shapes at ease on wing remain, Or on thin clouds their airy steps sustain. But tho', fair Painting! thus by just design, And strong expression, much to please is thine; Yet not from these thy utmost praises rise, For useful moral oft thy work supplies. When, 'midst Poussin's Arcadian vale serene, The virgin's sculptur'd monument is seen, And the sad shepherd pointing seems to say, âO Death, no place is sacred from thy sway!â Our mournful thoughts the well-known truth recal, That Youth and Beauty oft untimely fall Vide Poussin's Picture, called The Shepherds in Arcadia; engraved by Ravenet, in Mr. Boydell's Collection of Prints: Also the AbbÃ© Du Bos's Reflections on Poetry, Painting, and Music; and Dr. Warton's ingenious Essay on Didactic Poetry, in his Translation of Virgil.. On Carthage' plains when Marius meets the eye, And the stern PrÃ¦tor's mandate bids him fly; Fresh from the view the strong reflection springs, How strange the vast vicissitude of things! Rome's rival City to the dust deprest; Her haughty Consul there denied to rest There is a fine Picture of Mortimer's on this subject. The reply of Marius, to the messenger who came with orders for him to depart, was nobly concise and affecting: âGo, tell the PrÃ¦tor, thou hast seen Marius sitting on the ruins of Carthage.â! When Persia's Conqueror, 'midst her female train, Appears the chaste, the generous, and humane; His look, his action, on the mind impress The needful knowledge how to bear success Vide Le Brun's Alexander in the Tent of Darius, engraved by Edelinck.. Thus may thy Art, O Friend, for ever prove Of force, to Virtue, and from Vice, to move! To Statesmen, thoughtless on the heights of pow'r, Mark Wolsey's fall, or show his final hour; To Patriot eyes give Marvell's calm disdain, When Daney urg'd the tempting bribe in vain See the Life of Andrew Marvell, in Cibber's Lives of the Poets.; Or bid the Inconstant her own doom deplore In the sad exit of the hapless Shore The interview between Shore and her Husband, in the last scene of Rowe's Tragedy, would afford a fine Picture.. Without the Entheus Nature's self bestows, The world no Painter nor no Poet knows: But think not Mind in its own depth contains A source of wealth that no disbursement drains: Quick Observation, ever on the wing, Home, like the bee, its useful stores must bring; From hills, and vales, and rocks, and streams, and trees, And towns, and all that people those and these, From meanest objects that may hints inspire, Discolour'd walls, or heaps of glowing fire Vide Reynolds's Discourses, p. 61.. Care too beside thee still must take her place, Retouch each stroke, and polish every grace; For when we join not dignity with ease, Nor thou canst paint, nor I can write, to please. Perfection's point the Artist nearest gains, Who with his work unsatisfied remains: Da Vinci's thought an excellence conceiv'd, That his eye miss'd in all his hand atchiev'd Vide Graham's Account of Painters, in Dryden's Fresnoy, p. 278.. The Clear-obscure how happiest to produce, And what of various tints the various use, My lay to that presumes not to aspire, Nor with trite precept this thy ear shall tire: Coreggio's practice that describes the best; In Fresnoy's theory this we find exprest. No rude incongruence should thy piece disgrace, No motley modes of different time and place; By Grecian chiefs no Gallic airs be worn Vide Reynolds's Discourses, p. 87., Nor in their hands be modern weapons borne; Nor mix the crested helm and coat of mail With the vast curl'd peruke, or pointed tail. And sacred ever be the solemn scene From base intrusion of burlesque and mean; Nor in a Patriarch's or Apostle's sight Set snarling dogs and growling cats to fight. One caution further must the Muse impart; Shun Naked Form, that scandal of thy art: Even Dryden blames them who refuse to spare The painful blushes of the modest Fair. Let Decency her veil of drapery throw, And Grace diffuse its folds in easy flow Vide Dryden's Preface to his Translation of Fresnoy's Art of Painting, p. 22, &amp;c. where the licence of Painters, in the above respect, is severely censured.. And now, my Friend, for Thee may Fortune find Employ congenial to thy liberal mind; Not tasks impos'd by power, or chosen for gain, Begun reluctant, and pursued with pain. What warms the heart, the hand with force reveals, And all that force the charm'd spectator feels: For Genius, piercing as the electric flame, When wak'd in one, in others wakes the same. SONNETS AND MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. The following Sonnets, and the Stanzas addressed to Mrs. Macaulay, appeared in Pearch's Collection of Poems, published in 1770. The remaining Pieces are now first printed. SONNETS. SONNET I. APOLOGY FOR RETIREMENT. 1766. Why asks my Friend what cheers my passing day, Where these lone fields my rural home inclose, That all the pomp the crowded City shows Ne'er from that home allures my steps away? Now thro' the upland shade I musing stray, And catch the gale that o'er the woodbine blows; Now in the meads on river banks repose, And breathe rich odour from the new-mown hay: Now pleas'd I read the poet's lofty lay, Where music fraught with useful knowledge flows; Now Delia's converse makes the moments gay, The Maid for love and innocence I chose: O Friend! the man who joys like these can taste, On vice and folly needs no hour to waste. SONNET II. TO DELIA. 1766. Thrice has the Year its varied circuit run, And swiftly, Delia, have the moments flown, Since with my love for Thee my care begun, To improve thy tender mind to science prone. The flatteries of my sex I bade Thee shun, I bade Thee shun the manners of thy own; Fictitious manners, by example won, That ill for loss of innocence atone! Say, generous Maiden, in whose gentle breast Dwells simple Nature, undisguis'd by Art, Now amply tried by Time's unerring test, How just the dictates of this faithful heart; Which, with the joys thy favouring smiles impart, Deems all its care repaid, itself supremely blest! SONNET III. AFTER READING SHENSTONE'S ELEGIES. 1766. The gentle Shenstone much of Fortune' plain'd, Where Nature's hand the liberal spirit gave; Partial, her bounty she too oft restrain'd, But pour'd it full on Folly's tasteless slave. By her alike my humble prayer disdain'd, She stern denies the only boon I crave; O'er my fields, fair as those Elysian feign'd, To bid the green walk wind, the green wood wave. On the high hill to raise the higher tower, To ope wide prospects over distant plains, Where by broad rivers towns and villas rise; Taste prompts the wish, but Fortune bounds the power: Yet while Health cheers, and Competence sustains, These more than all, Contentment bids me prize. SONNET IV. PREFIXED TO LANGHORNE'S POETICAL WORKS. 1766. Langhorne! unknown to me (sequester'd swain!) Save by the Muse's soul-enchanting lay, To kindred spirits never sung in vain; Accept the tribute of this light essay. Sweet are thy songs, they oft amuse my day; Of Fancy's visions while I hear thee 'plain, While Scotland's honours claim thy pastoral strain, Or Music comes o'er Handel tears to pay. For all thy Irwan's flowery banks display, Thy Persian Lover, and his Indian fair; For all Theodosius' mournful lines convey, When Pride and Avarice part a matchless Pair; Receive just praise, and wreaths that ne'er decay, By Fame and Virtue twin'd for thee to wear. SONNET V. TO BRITAIN. 1766. Renown'd Britannia! lov'd Parental Land! Regard thy welfare with a watchful eye! Whene'er the weight of Want's afflicting hand Wakes in thy vales the Poor's persuasive cryâ When wealth enormous sets the Oppressor high, When bribes thy ductile senators command, And slaves in office freemen's rights withstand; Then mourn, for then thy fate approacheth nigh! Not from perfidious Gaul or haughty Spain, Nor all the neighbouring nations of the main, Tho' leagued in war tremendous round thy shoreâ But from Thyself, thy ruin must proceed! Nor boast thy power; for know it is decreed, Thy freedom lost, thy power shall be no more! MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. STANZAS ON READING MRS. MACAULAY'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 1766. To Albion's bards the Muse of History spoke: âRecord the glories of your native land, âHow Power's rude chain her sons' brave efforts broke, âAnd the keen scourge tore from Oppression's hand. âGive to renown the Patriot's noble deeds; âBrand with disgrace the Tyrant's hated name; âTho' Falsehood oft awhile the mind misleads, âImpartial Time bestows impartial fame.â She said; and soon the lofty lyre they strung, But artful chang'd the subject and the lore; Of kings, and courts, and courtly slaves they sung, And gloss'd with vain applause their actions o'er. The servile strain the Muse indignant heard; Anxious for truth, for public virtue warm, She Freedom's faithful advocate appear'd, And bore on earth the fair Macaulay's form. ELEGY IN THE MANNER OF HAMMOND; SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE AUTHOR'S GARDEN, DURING A STORM. 1756. Blow on, ye Winds! exert your utmost rage, Sweep o'er the dome, or thro' the forest howl! Could North with South, or East with West engage, What were their war to that within my soul? There adverse passions fierce contention hold, There Love and Pride maintain alternate sway, There fell Despair's dark clouds on clouds are roll'd, And veil Hope's transient, faint, delusive ray! Too charming Sylvia! dear capricious Fair! What strange perplexing change of mind is thine! No more thy smiles I'll trust, thy frowns I'll bear; I'll shun the beauty that must ne'er be mine! Was it for thee I form'd this fair retreat, Bade thro' the grove the smooth walk wind away, Adorn'd that walk with many a rustic seat, And by those seats bade tinkling runnels stray; Along my sunny wall the fruit-tree spread, Upon my eves expos'd the curling vine, Around my door the spicy woodbine led, Beneath my window saw the jasmine twine? Blow on, ye Winds! exert your utmost power, Rage thro' my groves, and bear down every tree; Blast the fair fruit, and crush the blooming flowerâ For Sylvia's lost, and these are nought to me! THE AUTHOR TO HIS WIFE. 1776. Friend of my heart, by favouring Heaven bestow'd, My lov'd Companion on Life's various road! Now six swift years have wing'd their flight away Since yon bright Sun adorn'd our nuptial dayâ For thy sweet smiles, that all my cares remove, Sooth all my griefs, and all my joys improve; For thy sweet converse, ever fram'd to please, With prudence lively, sensible with ease; To Thee the Muse awakes her tuneful lay, The thanks of gratitude sincere to pay! Thus long may Hymen hold for us his reign, And twine with wreaths of flowers his easy chain; Still may fond love and firmest faith be mine, Still health, and peace, and happiness be thine! STANZAS WRITTEN AT MEDHURST IN SUSSEX, ON THE AUTHOR'S RETURN FROM CHICHESTER, WHERE HE HAD ATTEMPTED IN VAIN TO FIND THE BURIAL-PLACE OF COLLINS. To view the beauties of my native land, O'er many a pleasing distant scene I rove; Now climb the rock, or wander on the strand, Or trace the rill, or penetrate the grove. From Baia's hills, from Portsea's spreading wave, To fair Cicestria's lonely walls I stray; To her fam'd Poet's venerated grave, Anxious my tribute of respect to pay Collins was born at Chichester, died, and probably was interred there.. O'er the dim pavement of the solemn fane, 'Midst the rude stones that crowd the adjoining space, The sacred spot I seek, but seek in vain; In vain I askâfor none can point the place. What boots the eye whose quick observant glance Marks every nobler, every fairer form? What the skill'd ear that sound's sweet charms intrance, And the fond breast with generous passion warm? What boots the power each image to pourtray, The power with force each feeling to express? How vain the hope that thro' Life's little day, The soul with thought of future fame can bless? While Folly frequent boasts the insculptur'd tomb, By Flattery's pen inscrib'd with purchas'd praise; While Rustic Labour's undistinguish'd doom Fond Friendship's hand records in humble phrase; Of Genius oft and Learning worse the lot; For them no care, to them no honour shown This censure may seem too generalâperhaps it is so. But must it not be allowed that the Public is capricious in bestowing its honours? Does not Westminster Abbey show monuments erected to men, as poets, who had little or no title to the name, while it contains no memorials of writers of far superior merit?: Alive neglected, and when dead forgot, Even Collins slumbers in a grave unknown. Flow, Lavant, flow! along thy sedgy shore Bear the fraught vessel from the neighbouring main! Enrich thy sons!âbut on thy banks no more May lofty Poet breathe his tuneful strain! VERSES TO A FRIEND, PLANTING. Proceed, my Friend, pursue thy healthful toil, âDispose thy ground, and meliorate thy soil; Range thy young plants in walks, or clumps, or bowers, Diffuse o'er sunny banks thy fragrant flowers; And, while the new creation round thee springs, Enjoy uncheck'd the guiltless bliss it brings: But hope no more. Tho' Fancy forward stray There scenes of distant pleasure to survey, To expatiate fondly o'er the future grove, The happy haunt of Friendship and of Love; Know, each fair image form'd within thy mind, Far wide of truth thy sickening sight shall find! TO AN ABSENT FRIEND. While thou far hence on Albion's southern shore, View'st her white rocks, and hear'st her ocean roar; Thro' scenes, where we together stray'd, I stray, And think o'er talk of many a long-past day. That favourite park now tempts my steps again, On whose green turf so oft at ease we have lain; While Hertford's turrets rose in prospect fair, And my fond thought beheld my Sylvia there; And much the Muse rehears'd in careless lays The Lover's sufferings and the Beauty's praise. Those elm-crown'd fields now oft my walk invite, Whence Lee's wide vale lies pleasant to the sight; Where, as our view o'er towns and villas roll'd, Our fancy imag'd how they look'd of old; When Gothic mansions there uprear'd their towers, Their halls for banquet, and for rest their bowers. But, O my Friend! whene'er I seek these scenes Of lovely prospects and delightful greens; Regardless idly of the joy possess'd, I dream of days to come, of days more blest, When thou with me shalt wander here once more, And we shall talk again our favourite topics o'er. On Time's smooth current as we glide along, Thus Expectation ever tunes her song: âFair these green banks with gaudy flow'rets bloom, âSweet breathe these gales, diffusing rich perfume; âHeed, heed them not, but carelessly pass by, âTo-morrow fairer, sweeter will supply.â To-morrow comesâthe same the Syren's layâ âTo-morrow sweeter gales, and flow'rets still more gay.â THE SHEPHERD's ELEGY; OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF AN INGENIOUS FRIEND. Upon a bank with spreading boughs o'erhung, Of pollard oak, brown elm, and hornbeam grey, The faded fern and russet grass among, While rude winds swept the yellow leaves away, And scatter'd o'er the ground the wild fruits lay; As from the churchyard came the village throng, Down sat a rural bard, and rais'd his mournful song. âNature's best gifts, alas, in vain we prize! âThe powers that please, the powers that pleasure gain! âFor O with them, in full proportion, rise âThe powers of giving and of feeling pain! âWhy from my breast now bursts this plaintive strain? âGenius, my Friend! with all its charms was thine, âAnd sensibility too exquisite is mine! âThere low he lies!âthat head in dust repos'd, âWhose active thought scann'd every various theme! âClos'd is that eye, for ever, ever clos'd, âWhence wont the blaze of sentiment to beam! âMute is that tongue, whence flow'd the copious stream âOf eloquence, whose moral lore so rare âDelighted and improv'd the listening Young and Fair. âWitness for me, ye rain-polluted rills; âYe desart meads, that one brown hue display; âYe rude east-winds, whose breath the dank air chills; âYe hovering clouds, that veil the Sun's faint ray! âWitness, as annual here my steps shall stray, âHow his dear image thought shall still recall, âAnd oft the sigh shall heave, and oft the tear shall fall!â As cease the murmurs of the mantling pool, As cease the whispers of the poplar spray, While o'er the vale the white mist rises cool At the calm sunset of a summer's dayâ So softly, sweetly ceas'd the Shepherd's lay: While down the pathway to the hamlet plain Return'd, with lingering steps, the pensive rural train. ON THE INGENIOUS MR. JONES'S ELEGANT TRANSLATIONS AND IMITATIONS OF EASTERN POETRY, AND HIS RESOLUTION TO DECLINE TRANSLATING THE PERSIAN POETS. The Asian Muse, a Stranger fair! Becomes at length Britannia's care; And Hafiz' lays, and Sadi's strains, Resound along our Thames's plains. They sing not all of streams and bowers, Or banquet scenes, or social hours; Nor all of Beauty's blooming charms, Or War's rude fields, or feats of arms; But Freedom's lofty notes sincere, And Virtue's moral lore severe. But ah! they sing for us no more! The scarcely-tasted pleasure's o'er! For He, the Bard whose tuneful art Can best their varied themes impartâ For He, alas! the task declines; And Taste, at loss irreparable, repines. CONCLUSION. TO A FRIEND. When erst the Enthusiast Fancy's reign Indulg'd the wild, romantic thought, That wander'd 'midst Arcadian vales, Sicilian streams, Arabian gales; Blest climes, with wond'rous pleasures fraught, Sweet pleasures, unalloy'd with pain! When Observation's calmer view Remark'd the real state of things; Whate'er amusive one obtain'd, Whate'er of use the other gain'd, To thee my verse a tribute brings, A tribute to thy friendship due. Accept then this, nor more require: The Muse no further task essays; But 'midst the sylvan scenes she loves, The falling rills, and whispering groves, With smiles her labours past surveys, And quits the syrinx and the lyre.
