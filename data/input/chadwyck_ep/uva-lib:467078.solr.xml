      <field name="fulltext">THE TESTAMENT OF AN EMPIRE-BUILDER âWe are the mightiest, The heirs of Rome; and with the power there lies A ruthless obligation on our souls To be despotic for the world's behoof. Ruthless I say, because the destinies Admit no compromise: we must be first, Though everlasting war cement each course Of empire with our blood . . . To break with all the ragged past, and be The demiurge of order and a time Stamped with my imageâis to chafe Mankind, and mark my power and daring, carved In deep amazement and a world-wide frown, Is to read triumph in a storm of hate.â Self's the Man. You must not let me lie so long . . . Three score And ten! . . . Self-knowledge ends in self-contempt: Man can be too familiar with himself . . . Let me not lie so long: recumbent nerve Evolves sublime designs, quintessences Of wit, and strokes of power, when the veins swell And tightened muscles twang; but in my head The turbid lees of blood settle and fume And harass me with dreams. Last night I saw The Universe in visions more intense Than any scene my memory can recall Of things beheld and done; while voices quaint Or awful in my sleeping ears conversed. I seemed to pace beside an olive brook That slumbered in a wood: the water bore A wandering arabesque of harvest leaves, Crimson and saffron, ebony, burnished gold, And in its bosom, coyly stowed away, Fantastic shadows, odds and ends of cloud, Sunbeams and purple patches of the sky. Under a chestnut-tree whose candles all Were out, and sconces broad from green to bronze Transmuted, Nennook, frosty-furred, addressed A group of beasts: my lord, the Elephant, The Lion, grave and watchful as a man; Aboma, umber-coloured, ringed and pied With sable stains and silver, worshipped once, A dreaded deity, in Anahuac; The Vulture-King, with wings as innocent In dye as fleurs-de-lis, yet guilt-adorned, With rose and violet and daffodil Engrailed upon his head and sinewy neck: Splendour and beauty are the flower and scent, The crown and sign of epicures in blood. Beside these humbly knelt the Groundling Ape; The rusty Hackney, truant from his cab; The patient Mastiff; and the placid Skunk In stalwart odour strong against the world. Said frosty Nennook, swaying plantigrade Upon his fur-shod soles, âThe rumour runs âThat as the rational, unbestial skill âOf Man develops energies profound âIn Matter latent, all the Earth must pass âBeneath His feeble heel; and all the tribes âOf noble beasts in native strength superb âBe rooted out by Him, whether they range âMalarial marshes; brilliant deserts laced âWith ivory skeletons; precipitous âAscents; remote ravines; fens, valleys, coasts âInclement; steaming jungles, spicy hot, âInwove with gorgeous flowers, with lustrous wings; âThe frozen sea, the silent waste of snow, âIceberg and red volcano north and south: âRegions inhibited to Him unarmed, âBy Him untenantable were they His, âAs even the envied quarters of the world âFor ever are to miscreated Man âOf mean inventions stripped: the fangless wretch! âUnhappy, clawless, hoofless, tailless, polled âBetrayer of the beasts; infirm, malign âUsurper, only strong in artifice! âHow think you? Is it true?â The Mastiff bayed, âIndubitably Man will oust you all. âI know Himâselfish as the jealous god âHis orient outcasts made: no perch of Earth âWill in the end escape His ruthless tools.â âAlas!â cried Nennook. âShall the Heavenly Dance âIllumine swarthy skies with sheaves of light, âMasses of splendid fire in diverse hues, âImpurpled carmine, ruby splashed with gold, âDeep violet, sapphire, emerald, orange, red, âEnarched or pulsing crystalline athwart âThe darksome firmament; and none of us, âHuge-footed, serpent-headed Polar Bears âTo revel in the Arctic glory, feast âOn blubbered seals that slumber on the floes, âOutspeed the salmon in his element, âAnd for the Kingdom of the icy strand âDefeat in battle swift the sullen Morse?â A Flea, ensconced behind the Mastiff's ear, Chirruped aloud, âNennook, my friend, take heart! âI, for example, must be soundly squelched; âBut the Idea of the Flea remains, âFor race continues always: permanence âOf species is established theory.â âEstablished nonsense, neighbour! Hold your tongue,â Snorted the domineering Elephant. âFew are the species that endure beyond âTheir geologic period. Answer this: âWhere are the giant beasts of ancient fame, âThe Labyrinthodon, the Plesiosaur, âDinornis, Mammoth, Megatherium?â âAy, and the Great Auk and the Dodo, both âExtant within the memory of the Swan, âThe Tortoise and the Raven,â lisped the Skunk. âAllow the wind, good brother beast! Stand off!â Said then the Groundling Ape, the Troglodyte. âExistence by itself abolishes âThe ill-equipped of every time and style; âOr if archaic specimens impede âThe fantasy of Matter thronged with shapes, âIn cataclysms, catastrophes of fire, âSubversions aqueous and glacial drifts âThose stubborn prodigies are swallowed up âTo clear the way for fresh experiment. âBut this be sure of: every horn and hoof, âAnd every insect, feather, fur, and fin âOf use to Man survives while Man survives. âOne gallant race besides, the Simian stock, âTo which I have the honour to belong, âOf no utility for draught or food, âThe science and the vanity of Man âWill foster to the end; because by it âHe swears when he propounds his progress vast âFrom sarcoid origins and new-beloved âHypothesis of Evolution.â âShame!â The Skunk rejoined with simulated zeal And brandished tail. âIf Man were worth his salt âThere would not now be left a single ape, âMacaque or lemur, lori or callithrix, âBaboon or gibbon to twit him with descent âFrom lewd abominable quadrumanes, âMimics of Men, whose pitiful burlesque âHas helped creation's Lord to theorise âIgnobly of Himself! Base Troglodyte, âI spurn the theory, and I hold your tribe âThe foulest zoological debauch, âThe misbegotten brood of some insane âUnholy prehistoric Human race, âIn loathsome commerce with pernicious beasts. âCatastrophes and cataclysms indeed! âI tell you, Troglodyte, Mankind will riseâ âA natural convulsion more devout âThan pilgrimage, hegira, or crusade, âMore general, for the monkeys, than the Floodâ âAnd in a panic of Ã¦sthetic ire âObliterate the libel on Himself.â âMay I be there to see!â the Vulture yapped. âAs well I wot I will be! Very sure âThe Vultures and their kindred must outlive âAll other things in order to devour âThe putrid carcass of the world at last.â âNay,â hissed Aboma in his silken tones, Uncoiling sumptuous wreaths of serpent; âMan âWill see the Vultures out. My ancestors âWere gods in Anahuac: I prophesy âThe final overthrow of bestial power.â âGods! gods?â cried frosty Nennook. âWhat are gods?â Aboma answered, âStock or stone, beast, bird, âInsect, or flame, or star, shadow of Man âOr fancied spirit, whom the Humans hold âResponsible, on whom they lightly lay âThe intolerable burden of their sins.â âTheir sins!â went Nennook. âMystery! What are sins?â Aboma then: âThe quaint abortion, Man, âPossesses conscience. Hearing, feeling, taste, âSight, scent are shared alike by Him and us, âBut what this conscience is no beast can tellâ âUnless it be some special cowardice âIn honour held by Man's perverted heart. âCertain it is that necessary deeds, âThe lustful propagation of His kind âOr happy slaughter of His enemies, âThis mouldering conscience turns to mortal sin. âEven in His war on us sin palsied Him, âUntil He made His affable deity âAppoint Him regent to subdue the earth, âWith perfect power over all fish, flesh, fowl, âAnd over all the earth and everything âThat moves upon the earth. No mortal beast âCan fathom the fatuity of Man!â âWe can!â the dusty Hackney neighed. âWe know âWhat conscience is: it is the lash; the lash, âAnd the corroding memory of the lash. âHow out of horses to contrive machines âThat shall excel machinery as an art âExcels the rule of thumb, Man's problem rose.â âYou put the cart before yourself, my friend: âWheels were an afterthought,â Aboma hissed. âIt may be so, but let me speak my mind; âGive me my head, for once,â the Hackney neighed. âHow might enduring memory be evoked âIn free forgetful stallions, thunderhoofed âOn prairie, pampas, heath and Tartar steppe; âExempt as winds that round the vagrant world âPursue their idle fancies, or, in dreams, âEnamoured roam the starry wilderness? âHow might an ignominious sense of shame âInvade the treasure-laden loins surcharged âWith proud posterity? Those valiant hearts, âTriumphant in the combat for the mares âWhen the great miracle of grass begins âAnd simple emerald blades elaborate âThe soul of earth, the virtue of the sun, âReplenishing the sexes!âhow might they, âThose hearts of stallions eager for a heaven âOf fragrant manes, wild glances, quivering flanks, âWherein to root their admirable raceâ âHow might they lose their courage, how admit âThe treacherous fear that undermines the will? âMnemonics and a discipline adept âIn conscience-rearing, Man, the traitor, wrought âWith grisly human craft upon Himself. âThe thing that never ceases to corrodeâ âThat makes a memory: anguish is the soil, âThe root, the stem of conscience and the flower: âThe lattice scourged upon the shoulder-blades, âThe slit snout, eyeless sockets, lettered cheeks, âCropped ears, maimed members, mouthless, tongueless maws! âIn baths of agony and seas of blood, âImpalements, flayings, faggots, caldrons, wheels, âMan thrust and branded, seethed and carved in Man âA memory and a conscience. So in us: âA scalpel to the pride of lifeâthe chief âUtilitarian sin that Man commits; âA rim of iron for the narrow way âNailed to the dull blunt foot that might have trod âThe yielding turf, in fenceless deserts free âFor all time, with spreading talons armed, âHad Matter dreamed us in her warrior mood; âA curb of iron in the helpless mouth; âA captive's meagre fare; and all day long âBetween the shafts, before the wheels, beneath âThe conscientious, the memorial lash, âThe torture of the intermittent rack âWith super-subtle cunning self-applied. âOut of the stallion thus they carve the nag, âAnd crown him with a conscience. Terrible âSolicitude in labyrinthine streets âAnd stifling throngs of noxious Men usurps âThe shrouded glance that matched the morning once; âA menace and a sombre mystery haunt âThe sunlight and the shadow; everywhere âImpalpable, remorseless duty kills.â With that the watchful Lion, grave and still, In level tones began: âHe overcomes. âWithin His brittle frame and tender flesh âResides a shameful power that bids Him veil âHis nature from Himself. Wherefore He swathes âHis genial gifts, and muffles trunk and limbs âIn lying garments, while His thoughts and deeds â(And all the thoughts and deeds of Man and beast âAre purely evil, Matter knows!) indued âWith moral liveries, masks, disguises, names, âParade His world of old hypocrisy âAs like themselves as Men are like baboons. âThis shameful powerâto us unthinkableâ âThat sees things other than they are, inflicts âA sanction, as our wise Aboma told, âOn sheer necessities, the evil use âWhereof delights us to the marrow. Soul, âThe virtuous title for this poison-glandâ âArmament, pestilence, I know not what!â âThat conquers and with loathsome sanction taints âThe noble evil of the Universe, âAssembles speed and strength, your mass and weight âMy lord, Aboma's coiling subtlety, âThe Skunk's mephitic odour, Nennook's grip âAnd hardihood, the sorry Hackney's sense âOf duty, Troglodyte's presumptuous ease, âThe Mastiff's courage bland, with swifter flight âAnd keener scent than yours, brother and king âOf vultures, into one essential force, âWhose dire enchantment felt in every nerve âIs all we know of that strange sorcery.â âBecause,â the undaunted Flea exclaimed, âthe Soul âPartakes agility phenomenal, âOutstripping me.â âWell said, illustrious peer!â The Lion laughed. âDid I forget you, friend?â âNot least in genius! Give the Elephant âYour saltatory powerâbehold the Soul âAs near as bestial fancy may conceive!â But now the Lion rose and lifted up A stormy mournful voice: âMan overcomes! âNo hope, no help for us, and no escape; âFor Soul invades the furthest nook of earth; âAnd out of earth, not Soul itself discerns âAn airy path to some uncursed abode. âHow long the race of Lions shall endure âAboma cannot tell; but this we know: âThe desert, darkness, and the quaking things âThat leave their dens aghast, when the stunned veldt âAnd shattered air transmit through circling leagues âThe heavy summons leonine that bids âReluctant flesh to supper, once again âShall hear that bodeful utterance as the last âUncaptured lion falls; then, nevermore. âBehind the bars the remnantâOh, how long âBehind unyielding bars penned in, and starved âOn morsels savourless, a gazing-stock âOf majesty made impotent, of old âIncarnate dread diurnally abused âBy human eyes like pigmies' arrows stuck âIn every pore; or scourged and branded, tamed âAnd disciplined . . . tame Lions, caged and lashed, âAttempting human tricks! . . . How long, sad earth! âAnd afterwards?âNo lions anywhere. âBut thisâthis strangles thought and speech: the Soul, âThat cannot but prevail, no scruple knows âOf self-imputed magnanimity; âBut like a savage conqueror destroys âAll record of the foe. The subtle means âOf our oblivion began, before âThe Soul grew conscious of profound design, âIf any consciousness to Soul belongs, âWhen in the zodiac His art impaled âA constellation of perfervid stars âNaming it Leo; and with the forgery âOf monstrous Sphinx, a lion's limbs and trunk âWith eagle's pinions, and the vacant face âAnd insolent bosom of His womankind. âThese treacherous images, significant âWith centuries of thought, adorned with dreams âAnd studied fancy of the nations, steeped âIn infinite emotion as in a sea âThat crusts with jewels sunken derelicts, âShall be devoutly cherished as the Soul's âBelovÃ«d offspring, when the splendid name âOf Lion, standing once for actual might âOf Matter's own great origin, has ceased âTo signify. That breaks my heart.â âMy liege,â Aboma hissed, suave courtier lowly coiled, âThe Soul of Man, incontinent in art, âProtean as AmÅba, capable âOf self-division as the Annelids, âHives off in form and legend manifold, âAlike in every guise yet always new. âMost true it is that Tritons, flaming Drakes, âMermaidens, Satyrs, Harpies, Hippogriffs, âChimera, Cheiron, Sirius, Minotaur âShall in imagination overlive âThe beasts they libel; but the punishment âOf that incontinence of Soul pursues âWith like defeat the victor-victim, Man. âHis CÃ¦sar, Christ, Mohammed, Tamerlane âAre featureless to Him; because the Soul, âEmbarrassed by their memory, fearing yet âOr impotent to cast them out, invests âTheir proper figure and significance âWith increments of fond Humanity, âFor all the world as China mussels, tricked âBy pious fraud, with automatic slime âTheir incommodious images veneer. âMoreover, sire, his best-beloved are these: âHamlet the Dane, and the ingenious Knight, âDon Quixote de la Mancha, shapes unreal âAs Sphinx, or Centaur, Boyg or Laidly Worm. âAnd thus is Soul betrayed, condemned and lost, âYet nothing knows of all its wantonness, âAbortive fantasy, and life-in-death.â âAy,â said the Lion, grave and still once more: âIt breaks my heart to think my race must pine âIn infamy, and wither out at last, âTo irreprievable oblivion doomed.â Darkness, and then a road wherein I walked, An old known road in England near the sea. Between its bevelled slopes a silence went, Like a full river gliding unperturbed; And moored upon the silence or adrift, The woodland noises floated: carnival Rehearsings of that savage epicure The throstle, who delights to tune his throat With tortured snails from battered houses torn; Dramatic interludes of gluttonous Starlings who gobble shell and all, with drums And cymbals of some stubborn hammering Nuthatch or fallow-chat, busy among The woodmites and the weevils beak and claw. But soon sad human tones and leaden steps, Discordant wheels and thudding hoofs broke up The tuneful silence. One strong voice I heard That uttered eager sayings by the way: My voice it seemed, and yet my lips were still; Myself I seemed, and yet both young and old; And thus the voice transmuted into speech The music of the murderous singing-birds: âWith ordure nourished, penetrating roots âOf cleanly flowers and scrupulous select âEssential virtue to enthral mankind âWith passionate hue and scent, by alchemy âInnate sublimed, as love sublimes a blush âIn faces virginal, distilled, as love âDistils a wondering sigh from innocence. âBut would I daub a rose with noisome filth âIn celebration of its birth and state, âOr for a badge in beauty's stomacher âImpale a skull and crossbones to portend âThat love and death are one? I would; and plunge, âUp to the shoulder, fingers, hands, and arms âIn the world's entrails, a psychometer âWho knows what spirit is! Let songsters kill âAnd banquet sumptuously as nature bids; âThe pangs of molluscs if they suffer pangs âAre well endured that pliant throats may gem âThe air at random, rubies, emeralds âIn squandered largesse pour, and richly pave âThe woodland paths with chrysolite and pearl. âSince knowledge kills or cures, untie the scarf âFrom love's weak sight and bid him then be strong, âBeholding grossly origins uncouth, âThe havoc of his triumph, and the vat âOf blood he steeps the world in . . . Ancient news! âThe world's aware! Is it so short a while âSince Cain killed Abel, since Bathsheba's son âDeciphered in a thousand ladies' eyes âThe rubric of the preacher? Or so long âSince Gallia slashed like fabled Behemoth âHer bluest veins in fierce self-surgery? âThe hardy world derides its growing pains âEven as the hardy soul. Despise, desert âThe cities where nonchalant steeplejacks âMiraculously keep the clocks behind âA century or so. Desert the roads, âThe highways laid with broken hearts of men, âAnd country lanes with tear-slaked ashes strewn; âThe latticed hedges, chosen cage of birds âAnd rustic lyre Ãolian; graven ruts; âThe liveried lightning's conduit manifold; âLuxuriant banks by traffic well-manured, âWhere yellow dandelions all ablaze âAnd cuckoo-buds of saffron light enrich âA violet-studded ground with ivy scrolled. âDull labour trudges here; ill-favoured wives âWhose bodies know no respite, breast or womb âAbused with offspring while their season lasts âOn errands shamble; foolish couples creep âFrom shadow into shadow when the moon âDapples the hedgerow path, or in the ditch âOn starless nights uneasily forestall âA licensed more convenient bridal-bed, âAnd blame the eglantine's alluring scent âAs potent as a philtre in the blood. âHere woeful children, odds and ends of life, âGrotesquely play; and here my Lady Bung âRolls in her landauâshe who joined her strain, âMatured of old on plundered abbey-lands, âWith modern stock fattened to peerage point âBy drunkards witting not their final cause. âHere huntsmen, gipsies, funerals, picnics, bands âBetween the hedges taint the virgin air âWith human effluence, hateful to a mind âIn travail and alone. Out of it all!â At once my dream achieved a lonely hill Wherefrom I saw the ocean welter wide, Like silver founded in a hollow mould Whose confines were the jangling seaboard strung With chords of pebble and the magical Horizon's glittering brink. A vapour, twirled Upon the potter's wheel, the earth, that shapes For pity or applause the very clouds, Rose like a fragile urn enveloping The spacious air: above its rounded mouth The firmament, a disc of amethyst, Received and echoed back in golden showers The larks' continual fugue. This vaporous urn, Wherein I stood coping its hill-crowned base Diverse of silver sea and emerald land, Like glass annealed in water, suddenly Upon some flaw of wind or scratch of light Crumbled together and became a cloud That wrapped me round. Aloft a tempest bore The cloud and me; then whirled the cloud away, And left me standing on the verge of Heaven. The native air thereof flattered my cheek With velvet wings, more sweet and delicate Than newblown zephyrs when the barley bends Its aigrettes to the ocean-tempered breath Of mundane summers; or touched me and grew still Like scented eyelids of an odalisque Profoundly learned in love, subdued and dumb With passion in the honied orient night. I watched the figures of the blessÃ«d dead Who wandered in the forests, or reposed Beside the brooks in glens of amaranth, That shamed the rainbow and in fragrance bore The bell from valley-lilies and the rose. There were the great who triumphed easily, In thought and glance, in word and deed supreme; Also the agonists who kept their arms, Hatred and envy, burnished bright with use, Who in their bosoms drove intolerance home, And let it rust, making a cankered wound To wring their hearts with rage and wind them up, As Eastern lovers, lest their valiant love Should slumber but a moment, in their flesh Ingraft a poniard for a talisman, And so transcending wake and bleed to death. There were the warriors, they who knew that war Can deify disgrace, project and change Ignoble causes into golden grounds, Who sought their foes instinctively, as bees With fervid song in search of honey roam, Whose daily business was the battlefield, Their hour of rest, the tedious interval Between two victories, who upset the world And deluged earth with blood; and there were those Whose craft was silence mainly and magpie speech, Whose apparatus of innuendo, nod, And supercilious lightning, cabinet Chicanery and documental gloze Did and undid and never could get done, But kept them still on top; and those whose prey Was honesty and scruple, foolish greed And sore necessity, who paved with souls Of friend and foe their desolate path to wealth: Kings, statesmen, emperors, proconsuls, popes, Dishonest brokers, robbers, millionaires. There, too, were those who fought the conquerors And would not yield at all; and those who died, Contemned and poor, but straining to the last For power and wealth, or at their proper hands, Refusing life because they failed to break The world's hard heart, and for a travelling rug Strip off its glossy hide: the fallen, the slain, The captives, madmen, bankrupts, suicides. Kings' mistresses in separate arbours sat, Sedately happy to be left alone; And harlots of the street in joyful herds Haunted the brakes and purlieus wild of heaven. Bevies of mothers beautiful as dawn Went up the shadowy aisles: Queens of the earth Who yielded willing harvest of their wombs For dynasties Time garners proudly yet, With simple wives who loved their spouses well And bore their chubby brats while nature would. I saw, besides, women renowned of old, Devout adorers of their own delight, Who treasured health, and trained their sensual powers With that innate prerogative of lust Desirous of a world of virile deed, Which made their chamber-doors the porch of death, Their tumbled beds to bloody biers transformed, Implacably renewing eager youth By slaughter of successive paramours. All these I saw at home in Heaven. All these! And all who challenged fate and staked their lives To win or lose the prize they coveted, Who took their stand upon the earth and drew Deep virtue from the centre, helped themselves, Desired the world and willed what Matter would. A while I slaked my thirsty sight with draughts Of heavenly vision till harmonious news Assailed my ears with music, deeply stained And sweeter than the scent of asphodel: It seemed inherent in the empyreal air, Attuned my pitch to Heaven's, transpierced my soul With rapture at the thought of agony, And made me search the depths for Tartarus Where those stupendous pangs of wind-driven wheels, Recoiling stones, of water borne in sieves, Of famished mouths with ghostly delicates Deluded momently, were wont to wring Ixion, Sisyphus, the impious host, And those sweet fifty, all save one, who slew Their virgin bridegrooms in their wedding-beds. Nowhere beholding these antiquer sights, My eyes began to ransack space for Hell, And Christian torments of the damned. I looked, And looked again to see the City of Dis Where heretics their heresies regret, Or scorn eternal pain, regretting nought, Entombed in sepulchres of fire, unpaved Till judgment, to be sealed for ever then; Or the deep-sighing forest ominous Where suicides like thorns and briars grow, Uncouth and barren wildings, rookery Obscene of mongrel birds; or to o'erhear That storm instinct with lamentation shrill, Where souls of tender lovers whirled about In utter darkness on the unstable air, Uplift unhallowed voices loud against The withering blast and terror of their flight. Like a swift pang of Hell it stung my mind, âThere is no Hell! All these courageous onesâ âIxion, lover of the Queen of Heaven, âThe Phrygian humorist who cooked strange flesh âTo test immortal palates, Corinth's lord âWho mocked at Death and laid him by the heels, âThe nuptial homicides of Argos, strong âTo keep their maidenheads for whom they chose, âArrogant Farinata, the Capuan, blind, âBetrayed, but master of his fate, and all âWho paired unwed, their seedtime having come, âAre here with me in everlasting joy!â But that sweet music, in my heart of hearts As vibrant as an octave bell that hums Harmonic mirth to hear his neighbour chime, Betokened agony, as certainly As braided strains of mundane sound denote A pitiful ambition-broken gang Of drilled executants, an orchestra; Announced a Hell, however peopled, ruled And wrought to such delight. Assured, I scanned The wide domain of Heaven, and in the midst Beheld a seated figure, richly clad In purple. Golden-haired, with luminous eyes And deep, he played upon a dazzling range Of adamantine notes; chromatic mail Of chrysoberyl, ruby, sardonyx, Topaz and emerald, and many a gem Unknown, plated the intermediate keys. A loom of strings or grove of tuneful pipes I nowhere saw; only in Heaven's midst The jewelled keyboard on a jasper plinth, And that celestial one who played thereon. At random glancing, by the music held In ecstasy, I marked, far off and faint As from the earth the galaxy appears, A glimmering colour diaper the light Wherein the ethereal bowers of Heaven were hung. Thrusting my whetted eyes athwart the abyssâ For on the instant I foreboded Hellâ Importunate, my vision first defined A nebula that girt the firmament; Then like a tapestry seemed the thickening haze, An arras-cloth with human eyes embossed, With glaring eyes; thereafter as a cliff, Precipitous it hung, a bastioned steep, Encompassing afar the golden clime, And vigilant with a million million eyes. At last, my gaze dynamic grown, I saw That this remote environment of Heaven, Tier upon tier of flesh from base to crown, This human amphitheatre was Hell Itself, constructed of its denizens. My knitted brows and roofed hand swept the vast Eternal cirque of heinous agony Still as an icy frontier in the moon, Except that groups and terraces of folk Distended myriad mouths for every key The gracious player struck: like drifts and flaws Of wandering air that ripple summer tides, The transient multitudinous gape and cry Flickered about the pallid wall. I knew As though myself had been the artificer, The whole design; in every bone and nerve, In every sinew and pulse of those that built Perdition up, the faculty of Hell, More vehement than flame, intensely wrought Perpetual and intolerable woe; And, subtler than the torturer's poison used To palsy action and invigorate sense In bloody gropings at the roots of life, Mortised each body-and-soul in ordered rank, Inhibiting spontaneous deed or sound. The gracious player on the jewelled keys By power celestial loosed with every touch Imprisoned horror in a massive cry Tuned to the fingered note, while winnowing space Mellowed the shriek of women and the roar Of men into immortal harmony, The ineluctable beatitude That moulded the demeanour of the blest, And lit their faces with eternal looks Subtle and sweet of malice gratified, The salt of beauty and the exquisite Original of all felicity. Materials of Hell? The altruists; Agnostics; dreamers; idiots, cripples, dwarfs; All kinds of cowards who eluded fact; Dwellers in legend, burrowers in myth; The merciful, the meek and mild, the poor In spirit; Christians who in very deed Were Christians; pessimistic celibates; The feeble minds; the souls called beautiful; The slaves, the labourers, the mendicants; Survivors of defeat; the little clans That posed and fussed, in ignominy left By apathetic powers; the greater part Of all the swarthy all the tawny tribes; Degenerates; the desultory folk In pleasure, art, vocation, commerce, craft; And all deniers of the will to live, And all who shunned the strife for wealth and power: For every soul that had been damned on earth Was damned in Hellâset there, replete with pangs, To watch eternally the infinite Delight of Heaven, extorted from himself And those beside him in the rampire built. Eternal justice, it was good to see Dives in Heaven and Lazarus in Hell Maugre two thousand years of Christendom! A dream of blasphemous inspiration? No; If Justice is, then there is Justice now; What is, will always be, if Justice is. Do I believe in Heaven and Hell? I do; We have them here; the world is nothing else. Beauty and power and splendour and delight Of chosen ones, elect ere Time began, In loathsomeness, debility, disgrace, Humiliation, travail, terror, woe, Of multitudes, of myrmidons, of all The labourers, soldiers, servants, rooted deep: He is a slave: a prisoner: damned: in Hell, Whose daily bread depends on toil approved. For me, I clambered into Heaven at once And stayed there; joined the warfare of the times In corner, trust, and syndicate: upheaved A furrow, hissing through the angry world, A redhot ploughshare in a frozen glebe, And reaped my millions long before my prime. Then, being English, one of the elect Above all folks, within me fate grew strong. The authentic mandate of imperial doom Silenced the drowsy lullaby of love, (Though now my turbid blood and nerves disused Complain of mystery unrevealed, and haunt Imagination day and night with looksâ With beckoning looks, soft arms and fragrant breath; For even in Heaven each ransomed soul frequents A private, an inevitable Hell!) Undid my simple, immature design, And made meâWhat! tenfold a criminal? No other name for Hastings, Clive, and me! I broke your slothful dream of folded wings, Of work achieved and empire circumscribed, Dispelled the treacherous flatteries of peace, And thrust upon you in your dull despite The one thing needful, half a continent Of habitable land! The English Hell For ever crowds upon the English Heaven. Secure your birthright; set the world at naught; Confront your fate; regard the naked deed; Enlarge your Hell; preserve it in repair; Only a splendid Hell keeps Heaven fair.</field>
