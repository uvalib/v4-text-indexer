      <field name="fulltext">THE WIDOW. A cottage stands in yonder woody dell— 'Twould from this knoll be plainly visible In winter, when the leafy trees are bare, Or when in spring the foliage still is rare. Its place is now marked only by the smoke Which slowly mounts behind that spreading oak; And in that woodland cottage dwells alone A widow old, and neighbour she has none; Were she with ear of finest power endued, Few sounds could reach her in her solitude, Far from the public road, in that deep glen, Far from the haunts and trodden paths of men. But age, which has her mind's intelligence Left unimpaired, has dulled the outward sense, Till scarce, with effort of far louder speech Than common, could your words unto her reach. One day, impressed by that deep silence round, That calm inviolate by a single sound, I said,—what perfect stillness must be hers! For neither were the world's loud sounds and stirs Around her—nor if such there were, could they, For her at least, that stillness chase away; And earnest hope I thereunto exprest, That such the inward quiet of her breast; And then she told me, her infirmity, To which I deemed this gain might owing be, Gave her not that exemption which I thought, But that quite opposite effects it wrought; For still she strove in vain to separate The noises which her own brain might create, In which was aye a tumult and a rout, From sounds which might come to her from without; And how quite helplessly exposed she lay To all strange tricks her fancy cared to play; How, often when she knew herself alone, Since other inmate in the house was none, Listening, she heard what seemed to her the tread Of many persons moving overhead; Or, in the night, a trampling and a sound Of hurried feet, the outer door around. And sometimes, in her noonday solitude, Voices came to her from the neighbouring wood,— Voices which seemed to call her by her name, And she would answer them, but no one came; And still, if other noise was none, a roar As of great waters plunging evermore Was in her ears.—This much that time she said, But added cheerful words, and such as bred A pleasant faith within me, that no less Hers was that heritage of quietness Whereof I spake, the spirit's inner peace, From all disturbances a blest release, Which the world cannot give, nor make to cease. [One time I was allowed to steer] I One time I was allowed to steer Through realms of azure light;— Henceforth, I said, I need not fear A lower meaner flight: But here shall evermore abide, In light and splendour glorified. II My heart one time the rivers fed, Large dews upon it lay; A freshness it has won, I said, Which shall not pass away, But what it is, it shall remain, Its freshness to the end retain. III But when I lay upon the shore, Like some poor wounded thing, I deemed I should not ever more Refit my shattered wing— Nailed to the ground and fastened there: This was the thought of my despair. IV And when my very heart seemed dried, And parched as summer dust, Such still I deemed it must abide; No hope had I, no trust That any power again could bless With fountains that waste wilderness. V But if both hope and fear were vain, And came alike to nought, Two lessons we from this may gain, If aught can teach us aught— One lesson rather—to divide Between our fearfulness and pride. THE MANNA. And canst thou, Lord, a table dress, A table in the wilderness? How should our souls be satisfied In this world's desert waste and wide? Shall we not join the multitude, And say there is not any good, Nothing to feed the soul of man— But that with which his life began, His little stock of love and joy, All things diminish and destroy, Till wasted quite, nor any more Renewed—an unreplenished store? How shouldst thou, Lord, a table dress, A table in the wilderness? 'Twas Israel's cry—nor theirs alone, For what were all the evils shown In them, their unbelief and pride, Distrust of him so often tried, And ne'er found wanting, what indeed, But writ in large that all may read, Each one his own in whole or part, The tale of every human heart? Around their camp the manna lay, For each to gather every day, In copious showers of pearly dew, Sweet as the sweetest thing each knew, And did not fail, but richly last Until the desert's bounds were past, And Canaan's borders, and the bright Inheritance was all in sight. So we in this world's desert fed By him who is our heavenly bread, We too may pass from strength to strength, From joy to joy, until at length Before his presence we appear, Not fainting on our journey here. THE PRAISE OF MEN. Cum laudaris, teipsum contemne. Augustine. When men exalt thee with their flatteries, Be thou provoked thine own self to despise, And for an help to this, the meanest thing Which thou hast ever done to memory bring. Think too that now thou dost in peril fall Of doing a yet meaner thing than all, If being what thou art in thine own sight, Thou canst this praise appropriate as thy right. KNOWLEDGE. Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting. Wordsworth. True knowledge is the waking up of powers To conscious life, which were already ours. What now is mine in leaf and flower and fruit, Was mine before in blossom, bud, and root. The writing that had faded quite, again By chymic art comes out distinct and plain. Springs that were stopped, when that is cleared away Which choked them, bubble forth in open day. The stars look forth at eve, which yet have been All day in heaven, although till now unseen. The dawn lights up the landscape; the great Sun Shows, but not makes, the world he looks upon. I found a rich pearl flung upon my coast, Which yet no other than myself had lost. I entered a large hall—no foreign dome, But even mine own long-lost abandoned home. In what at first appeared a stranger's face, An ancient friend I daily learn to trace. I am at rest—my centre I have found, The circle's edge I had been wandering round. VI. [Once if I felt no heart nor strength to pray] Once if I felt no heart nor strength to pray, If of a sudden vanished quite I found The goods wherein I dreamed I did abound, And this blank mood continued many a day, I was quite swallowed up in dim dismay: My heart, I said, by deadly frost is bound, And never will warm days again come round: But now more hopefully I learn to say— Either some sin is lurking in my breast, Troubling the host See Josh. vii. 25., which being once confest, He will his presence and his light restore, Or thus one needful lesson he is fain To teach—that in ourselves we are always poor, Which learned, he soon will make me rich again. VIII. [If thou hast found much comfort in thy prayer] If thou hast found much comfort in thy prayer, Sweet foretastes of anticipated heaven, If this was so, or if these were not given, It is not well to weigh with too much care; For many times these sweets imparted are, Like sugared dainties, onward so to win Young scholars who in Christ's lore first begin, That to his school they may again repair. But of this thing be careful—here give heed, Since this and not thy pleasure is the end Of all thy prayer, this question often ask— Does it more holy self-denial breed, And leaves it thee more fearful to offend, With loins succinct, readier for every task? IX. [As circle beyond circle evermore] As circle beyond circle evermore In the still water spreads and spreads, until The whole expanse of lucid pool they fill, And the last ripple touch the further shore— Dilating so, nor finding pause before It has extended o'er the largest space Which love can hold within its wide embrace, Prayer issues from the bosom's central core. First for himself the High Priest his offering makes, This done, for others, for those nearest found, The circle of the sacred home, and then For the whole Church of God, and lastly takes— His ample intercession takes all men Within the limits of its mighty round. XIII. [Why have we yet no great deliverance wrought] Why have we yet no great deliverance wrought, Why have we not truth's banner yet unfurled, High floating in the face of all the world, Why do we live and yet accomplish nought? These are the stirrings of unquiet thought, What time the years pass from us of our youth, And we unto the altar of high truth As yet no worthy offering have brought. But now we bid these restless longings cease, If Heaven has aught for us to do or say, Our time will come; and we may well hold peace, When He, till thrice ten years had past away, In stillness and in quietness upgrew, Whose word once spoken should make all things new. XV. [He might have built a palace at a word] He might have built a palace at a word, Who sometimes had not where to lay his head: Time was, and he who nourished crowds with bread, Would not one meal unto himself afford: Twelve legions girded with angelic sword Were at his beck, the scorned and buffeted: He healed another's scratch, his own side bled, Side, feet, and hands, with cruel piercings gored. Oh wonderful the wonders left undone! And scarce less wonderful than those he wrought; Oh self-restraint, passing all human thought, To have all power, and be as having none; Oh self-denying Love, which felt alone For needs of others, never for its own. XVI. JESUS WEEPING OVER JERUSALEM. Oh city, of all cities crown and joy, He who so yearned love's banner to uprear, And gather round it all thy children dear, Could yet the armies of his wrath employ, Sending the Roman his sharp sword to cloy With slaughter of thy children, till the ear Tingles at history's worst tale of fear: He who wept over thee could yet destroy. And he has tears for sinners—natural tears, And tears of blood; yet who will now dare say, By thy dread doom remaining still untaught, That since such love lives in his heart alway, He therefore, moved by weak relenting fears, Will see his righteous threatenings come to nought? XVII. [When God is to be served, the cost we weigh] When God is to be served, the cost we weigh In anxious balance, grudging the expense: The world may use profuse magnificence; A thousand lamps from gilded roof may sway, Where its poor votaries turn the night to day, And who will blame? but if two tapers shine Apart before some solitary shrine, “Why was this waste?” indignantly men say. Oh hearts unlike to his who would not bring To God, releasing him from dismal fears, What cost him nothing for an offering! Unlike to hers, commended while she shed Of that true nard which grows in spiky ears, A rich libation on her Saviour's head! XVIII. [Where is the man who, if his heart were whole] Where is the man who, if his heart were whole, Would yield a treasure which he still might guard, Enough contented, if he afterward Might live upon the robber's alms and dole? Or who were of so servile base a soul, Because fair terms were offered of the foe, To render up the fort without a blow, Whence he might check the invader and control? And nations that at danger's front so quail, Even this their miserable hope shall fail; One lesson History bids them lay to heart, One truth in hours of peril to recall— They struggle vainly to preserve a part, Who have not courage to contend for all.</field>
