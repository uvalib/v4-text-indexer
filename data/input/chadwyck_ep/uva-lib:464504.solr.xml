      <field name="fulltext">[Volumes I, II, III, IV.] [I] A Middle English Metrical Paraphrase of the Old Testament (MS. Selden Supra 52.) Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. [Genesis incepit.] 1 God fader in heuyn of myghtes most That mad this mold and all man kynd, The sun þat sendes vs throwth to tast wesdom and welth and wytt at wyn, The grace of the holy gast In whom all gudnes behoues to be gyn Thrugh mediacy of mary chast That helpes to safe vus of our syn, Swylke my?t vnto me send thys boke ry?t to aray, Begynnyng, myddes, and end, that yt be to goddes pay. 2 This buke is of grett degre, Os all wettys that ben wyse, ffor of the bybyll sall yt be the poyntes that ar mad most in price, Als maysters of dyuinite and on, the maystur of storyse, ffor sympyll men soyn forto se, settes yt þus in this schort assyse; And in moyr schort maner is my mynd forto make yt, That men may lyghtly leyre to tell and vnder take yt. 3 This boke that is the bybyll cald, and all that owtt of yt is drawn, ffor holy wrytt we sall yt hald and honour yt euer os our awn; All patriarkes and prophettes yt told, so [e]uer þer saynges sekerly ar knawn, And all wer fygurs fayr to fald how coymmyng of crist my?t be kawn. God graunt vs crist to knaw All our form faders crauyd And so to lere is law that our sawlis may be sauyd. 4 In this begynnyng god vus wysch well for werke with wyll and toy?t. In this boke that [is] cald genesis ther may men see the soth vnsogh how god, that beldes in endlese blyse, all only with hys word hath wrogh heuyn on heght for hym and hys, this erth and all that euer is oght. This erth was wyde and wast and no gud on yt grouyd; On the heght the holi gast Abown the waters mouyd. 5 hell he mad marke thrugh hys my?t So that no medcyn mend yt may; God bad that in the heuyns on hyght Suld be mad lyght for [euer and] ay, And þer in mad he angels bryght to serue hym self euermoyr to pay. The merknes namyd he to be ny?t, And the lyghtnes to be day. O[f] angels on was schefe, And hys name lucyfer, Vnto his lord most lefe, in ynglysch “ly?t beyrer”. 6 And for he was so fayr that tyd, Angels in hest [sone can] he hent, And sayd he suld be glorefyd lyke to hym that hys lyfe had lent. Then in this blyse my?t he not byd bott hastely to hell he wentt, ffor syn in heuyn is non hyde. All dyd the same of hys assent; The tend ordyr of angell Thurgh prid, os kend our clerkes, Vnto fowle fendes fell. þer wer the fyrst day werkes. 7 When god that semly sy?t con see, hym toy?t yt well withoutyn were. A firmament then bad he be To part the waters in sonder seyre. The watur a bown þan ordand he To wend abowt with wyndes clere, That oþer by neth in law degre To moyst the erth in his manere. The firmament namyd he heuyn, To lend lastand for ay. Ther ys no moyr to neuyn. So sessyd the secund day. 8 The waters that wer on erth ordand god hath them geddyrd all in a sted, And the sted that thei suld in stand ys callyd the se by ryghwyse rede; And the dry erth namyd he the land, he bad that yt suld spryng and sprede herbys and treyse with wod and wand And sed to saw when thei wer dede, So that new suld vp spryng There sted for to restoyre And flours and frutt furth bryng. The thryd endyd þore. 9 God ordand then grett lyghtys two T[o] moy[u] apon the firmament To parte the days the nyghtys fro, and ?er fro ?er be sesons sent, The moyr be for the day to go And the lesse to the ny?t at attent. The sun and the moyn namyd he them, By them on erthe the ly?t is lent. Sternys on heuyn he sett with bemys schynand for bryght By certan mesurs mett. Thus was the faurt day dyght. 10 God bad that in the see suld brede dyuerse fysches to flett with fyn, And of them selfe thei sall haue sede All way to wax waters with in; And fowls he ordand fayr forto fede with wynges and wynd ther way to wynd, By erth and ayer þer lyfes to lede And same won withoutyn fynd. he blessyd þos werkes fayr That they n[o] myrth suld myse, Bot fyll both watur and ayer. The fyft day werke was this. 11 Then bad god þer suld bestes bee on dyuerse kynd os thei ar kend On ylka syd in seyre cuntre, And wormes on the wome to wende. Then sayd he to hym self, “make we A man that may bestes mys Amend, ffor haue power and pauste on bestes and fowls withoutyn end. And that man wyll we geyse Aftur our awn ymage ay And like to our awn liknes.” So was don the sext day. 12 God toght the consell was not clere A man alon hys lyf to led; Som oþer suld be vnto hym nere hym forto helpe yf he had nede. Owt of hys syde hee sonderd seyre A crokyd rybe, os clerkes can rede, And þer of formyd he hym a fere, A female, frutt furth to bred. he gafe them power playn Abuf All erthly thynge, with all gudes that my?t gayn Tyll thei breke hys bydyng. 13 God gaf man fre wyll to be wyse, And in certan he sett hys name; Then plantyd he erthly paradyse And [in] that place he putt Adam. he fyllyd yt full of all delyce And made hym suferan of the same, wyls he wold wone withoutyn vyce, þer forto byd withoutyn blame. Ther wer all erbys and tress with flours and frutt gud woyn; God bad Adam go chese, and ette of all bot on. 14 In myddes of paradyse yt stud with frut [so] fayr to fede and fyll; Who of that frutt my?t fang þer fude suld clerly knaw both gud and yll. þerfor god wernyd hym for hys gud, And bad hym lett that frutt be styll, “yf þou yt ethe, with wordes wode Soyn [þ]o[u] be wast owt of thy wyll.” Of all oþer that ther wer he gaf hym largely lefe, That bad he hym for beyr ffor dowt of moyr myschefe. 15 Bot then the fend, our fellyst foe, That fallyn was not fer be fore, ffor that werkyng he was full wo That þo wyghys so worthy were; within hym selfe persauyd he soe That thei the same sted suld restore That he and hys felows fell fro; That mad hym mornyng mekyll more. he toyght so suld not be, þerfor in schort qwylle he soyght vp sotelte them both for to gyle. 16 he wyst full well withoutyn wene how god had demyd in all degre. As a serpent soyn was he sen, with woman face full fayr and [free]. To Eue he sayd, “what may yt meyn That ?e tent noy?t to this tree?” Scho sayd, “that wold turne vs te tene; God bad that we suld lett yt be”. The fend sayd, “foyles the more, by that skyll scornyd ar ?e; God wold not that ?e wer Alway so wyse os he”. 17 “This frutt may gyf wysdom and wytt, Als godes so sall ?e both be gyn”. Scho saw that frutt so fayr and fytt, And eth þer of this welth to wyn. Scho bad Adam to ette of yt, To bytt þeron he wold no?t blyne. hys boldnes and that balfull bytt Cast hym in care and all hys kynd. When thei this frutt had takyd, qwerfor thei wer both blamyd, Thei saw then thei wer nakyd, ffull yll thei wer a schamyd. 18 With lefys þer priuates can thei hyd, And playnly durst thei not apeyre. God callyd on Adam in that tyd, And he sayd, “lord, I hyd me heyre, I hath so doyn, I der not byd.” God askyd why and in what manere. “lord, yf I wer yll ocupyd yt was thrugh fandyng of my fere”. God askyd why that schoe went That forbeyd frutt for to fele. Scho sayd, “lord, the serpent gart me do ylka deyle.” 19 God told then vnto all thre what thei suld feyle for þer forfeytt. To the worme he sayd, “waryd þou be, wend on thy wome ay erth forto eytte; And, woman, frutt that comys on the Sall be broy?t furth with paynys grett; And, Adam, for þou trowd not me, wyn þou thy foyd with swynke and swett; So sall all thyn of spryng vnto the vttmast ende”. To manys kynd com this thyng Thrugh falssyng of the fend. 20 fro paradyse thei wer exilyd withoutyn grace agayn to passe. So went thei both os bestes wyld, Thei cowd no louyng. bot alase, Soyn Eue consauyd and bare a chyld, Cayn, that sythyn so cursyd was Be cause of Abell meke and myld That he slow with a cheke of a nase; ffor the offerand of abell was accepte in goddes sy?t, And Caymys went down to hell and to god gaf noe ly?t. 21 When Adam wyst withoutyn wer This wekyd werk, he was full wo; he morned euer and mad yll cher ffor meke Abell was murtherd so. Bot aftur that full mony A ?er, When he tyll Eue agan can go, Then bare scho suns and doyghters sere, The story says sexty and moe; Then ylke on oþer toke and lyfyd be law of kynd, Als who so likes to loke may seke And forther fynd. 22 Of caymys kynd come Tubulcan, of metall mellyd he amang, And diuerse thynges to helpe of man ordand he both schort and lang. hys brothyr Iuball he began musyke, ose mynstralsy and sang. The harpe by hym was ordand then And oþer myrth qwer men suld gang. Of Adam suns the thryd hyght Seth, man myld of mode. he wrott what dedes thei dyd That last aftur the flode. 23 Of seth then com Matussile, lyfyd he ix C sexty and ix ?ere, Of hym com lameth, of hym noe that vnto god wer gud and dere. And Noe had suns fully thre, Sem, cham, Jafeth in fere. Then was the werld gone in degree Thre Thowssand [?ere] for neuen by nere. No rayn on erth then fell to gayr the gresse vp ryse, Bot faur fludes of a well that went from paradyce. 24 Then was no lernyng of no law; Thei lyfyd in lust euyn at þer lyst. þer creatur thei cowde noy?t knaw, The wenyd that non ther werkes wyst. fforto greyfe god thei had non aw, þerfor all myrthes son thei myst. God spake to noye and sayd this saw, “þou and thy chylder sall [be] blest; All folke so fowll I fynd coruppyd and soyllyd with syn; Me rewthes I made man kynd To wond thys werld with in. 25 “And sen I se them so myse gone And in hert ha[ue] no mynd of me, I sall dystroy them euery ylkon. Ouer all this werld sall wax A see So that on lyue sall lefe ry?t none Bot þou, þi wyf, thi suns thre, And þair thre wyfes, ?e aght alon In land to lyf sall leuyd be. Bestes and fowles in flygh Non beys for ruth refusyd, Or all to ded be dyght ffor syn ?e folke hath vsyd.” 26 “To make an erke of tymber strang þou and þi mene?e into abyd, Thre hunderth cubbettes loke yt be lang, And fyfty cubbeyttes it sall be wyd, And thryty cubbeyttes the heght sall gang; And sett a wyndow in the syde, And cloyse yt well, elles dows þou wrang, To turne the watur in ylka tyde. And stages grett plenty bus the make, mony and fayre, Wher bestes and fowles may be, of ylka kynd a payre.” 27 When all was wroygh in hys kynd wyse, yt raynnyd, als then was goddes wyll, ffaurty days be full asysse And faurty nyghtys to tell þer tyll. The watur ouer the werld can ryse, ffyfty cubbeyttes ouer the heghest hyll; yt drownyd the pepyll in all partyse Bot VIII that in the arch wer styll. Then monethes yt encressyd, And in armynie that tyd, When the watur sessyd, the arch be gan to abyd. 28 And þerby Noe can vnderstand That thei wer sett apon som playn. A rayuen he sent furth to seke the land, Bot that fowlle com not a gayn. Then to A dowfe he hath commawnd To seke hym sum thyng for certan. An olyue branche full soyn he fand and broy?t to schep,—then wer thei fayn. Soyne thei saw then drye apeyr in dyuerse place. To land thei hast in hye And louyd god on hys grace. 29 The bestes in ther kyndes knew Vnto what party thei suld repayre To hold them hole of hyd and hew, And fowles flow furth in the Ayre. And noye suns then satt and sew, And soyn the broy?t furth frutt full fayre, And so the werld then wex all new; Thei multiplyd with mony an heyre. God gafe a sygne to noye Of the raynbow ry?t þore, That he suld neuer dystroye the we[rl]d with watur moyre. 30 Noye was the fyrst that vynes sett wyhc bare of grapes full grett plente. Of them so sadly can he eytt That of the wyn dronkyn was he; he fell on slepe down on hys flett; Caym com and scornyd hys preuyty, his brethyr duly dyde þer dette And hyd hym Agayn in god degree. When Noye his werkyng wyst he werryd hym for thi; his brethyr both wer blest Als þer werke was worthy. 31 The pepyll fast then multiplied Tho thowssandes moe, or VI, or VII. Thei fand a feld was lang and wyde, And þor in hand thei ordand euyn And began A grett towr in that tyd wych thei sayd suld rech vnto heuen. When god saw them sett so in prid, he kast forto dystroy þer steuen. Noyne wyst what oþer wald, Bot euyn ose foylles thei foyn, Wherfor that place is callyd This day bablion. 32 Sythyn Noe persauyd by knawyng clere That day was comyn that hym bod dy; Then had he lyfyd in landes here ix C wynters and als fyfty. yf we suld say hys suns all sere And then depart þer progenite [þ]att lesson wer full long to leere. þerfor we lefe them mor lyghtly And neuen bot that nedes, and euyn vnto vnderstand, And þat most lely ledes to lere our law in land. 33 Of seme come phaloge forþer þan, And of phaloge come thare, Abraham, Nacor, and Aran; Thare suns wer all thos thre. Of Aran com loth, þat lele man, That honerd god in gud degree. Vnto this pepyll god began To multiplye and make them free. Then wer þer systers Tway, abram toke saray, And Nacor toke melkala, Thei wer ther wyfes worthay. 34 Ther was ay wunt to wun In vrry, whar caldeis wonnand were. Ther dyed Aran ?ongest son, was loth fader, os we herd here. And loth with abraham furth was fun as with hys eme and man most nere. Then thare so with yll was bown, To lyf he my?t not langer here. he died when he was old Twa hunderth ?er, men wott. Then is her no ferthermer told Bot of Abram and loth. 35 God spake to abraham for his sped, “On this fold may þou not be fune, Bot take thy wyfe and with the lede, I sall the wysch wher þou sall wune To haue enogh and neuer nede, with loth also thi brothyr sune. þor sall I multiplye thi sed And helpe the os I hath be gune.” To the land of Canan so sent he furth þos thre. God sayd to abraham then, “This land gyf i to the.” 36 Abraham and loth can same dwell with mekyll myrth full mony a ?ere; Thei wex so rych that þer catell Couerd the cuntre fer and nere. Then mad thei counand them a mell That the suld make ther wonnyng sere, ffor grett debatt that oft fell Amang them that ther hyrdmen were. Abraham wonnyd styll at home wher god had byddyn hym come, And loth wentt to sodome, A cyte be syd the flume. 37 Sodome was A grett cety, gommer an oþer nere ther by, And next them was þer oþer thre, The wych wer fyllyd with syn fouly. Thei drede not god in no degre, Bot lyfyd in lust and lechere— And þat thei schewyd in sy?t to see— And agaynst kynd most on cumly. ffoule is to declare how þer werkyns was. No syb ne spoussyd þai spare, ne nowther lad ne las. 38 long aftur that this grett warre con spryng Amang kynges of that cuntre. ffor god sayd thei sall sese for no thyng, Or tho V cytes conquerd be. Baram was of sodam kyng, And gomer also gouernd he. When he herd tell of this tythyng, he semyld pepyll full grett plente, Agayns his enmys to go with schott, scheld, and spere; And loth was on of þo, A full wysman of were. 39 Sone wer þai semyld ylkon And bett on fast with burnyscht brandes. The sodomites wer soyn sloyn; The my?t not flee, thei lefyd þer landes. And in that batell loth was tane And holdyn in hys enmys handes. Abraham, hys eme, was wyll of wone when he herd tell [of] þos tythandes. he wold not byd ne blyne, Bott went with power playne, And rescuyd hys cosyn, And broy?t hym home agayn. 40 Thus sauyd he all thies folkes in fere That presond war and putt to pyn. Melchesedeke when he can here how abraham had sauyd hys cosyn, Agayns hym wentt he with gud chere, And present hym with bred and wyne. he sayd, “I wott withoutyn were God is thy frend full fast and fyne.” he was both prest and kyng, And keper of the lay; he wyst well that this thyng was gretly god to pay. 41 The thryd day abraham was comyn hame To se his seruandes old and yonge. God come to hym and callyd by name Abraham, “I thanke the of this thyng; Als I desyrre, þou doys the same; þerfor thi frutt sall spred and spryng. þou sall haue welth of wyld and tame And myght without more mournyng.” he sayd, “what myrt emong [haue I] of tame and wyld, fforto lyfe her þus lang And dye withoutyn chyld?” 42 God kend hym comforth in that tyd; ffurth of hys hows he can hym lede, And bad hym see on ylka syde Ouer all the land in lengh and brede. “All sall be thyne and with the abyd And to thyn heyrs ay furth to fede. Ose grauell in the se is multyplyd, So sall I multiplye thi sede. Who so may tell be tale the stern Apon heuyn, Als essely thei sall thi sed nowmer and neuyn.” 43 Abraham was all merueld then That euer hys sede suld sogattes ?elde By cause that his wyfe was baran, And thei wer both in grett eld. The wyf wroy?t ose a gud woman To geyt a barne to be þer beld; hyr seruant preuely scho wan tyl abraham at hys wyll to weld. þerfor so yt be fell: scho beldyd by hym all ny?t And consauyd ysmaell, that afterward was full wyght. 44 When Agar wyst scho was with chyld, hyr hert in pride be gane to ryse; hyr maystrys that was meke and myld In all hyr dedes scho can dyspyse. Then sarai wyst scho was be gylyd, Bot euer scho wrogh os woman wyse. hyr and hyr barn both can scho bylde, And prayd euer god for bettur gyse To send them sum ry?t ayre That my?t ther welthes weld. Bot scho was in dyspayr any barn to beyre for eld. 45 Aftur qwen abraham was old A C wynters, then wex he tame, And in that tyme god to hym told Wher he wonnyd in his hows at hame, “To haue A son þou sall be bold, And ysac sall be his name; he sall haue frutt full mony fold.” Abraham toke tent and trowd that same. God commaund in þat tyd that abraham and all his Suld all be circumcisyd, so to amend þer mys. 46 So dyd thei sone and hyght in hy The law of god hertly to hold. ffor abraham it is sayd schortly That abraham then he suld be cald, And hys wyf, that hygh sarai, ffull sare suld hyr name be tald. Ther kynredyn and þer cumpany wer circumsysed so ?ong and old. ffor Abraham trowd þat thyng, ose clerkes declare it can; The trowth and the begynnyng of our fayth þer be gane. 47 ffell aftur long apon a day Abraham was tyllyd vnder A tre In hy seson hym to play By syd A hyll that heght Mambre. Thre chylder com þor in the way als comly ose euer men my?t see, [And] cled in honest wed wer þai, All semand on eld to be, ffor thei wer fayr to sy?t; he helsyd them os hende, And herberd them all ny?t, And askyd whedder þei wende. 48 Vnto hym answerd on of þai And sayd, “we ar goddes messynger; I am sent [vn]to sara, Scho sall haue A son this same ?ere, And to morn wendes my felows twa To do goddes bedyng, both in fere; To sodom and Gomor þei go To synke them down for syns sere.” Tokyn of the trinite to abraham þer was tone. All yf he saw ther thre, All he honerde os one. 49 Abraham had care then for hys kyne And for hys frendes þat ill suld fare. he prayd god for to abyd and blyn And gud folke for the yll to spare. God sayd þer was non gud þer in Bot loth and þo that with hym ware; And fro that wo well suld thei wyn. So was he comforth of his care. Tway chylder wentt at morn to sodom the gaynyst gate. Thei fand loth them be forne When thei enterd the ?atte. 50 Vnto hys hows with them he hyed And ordand mett for them and mo. Hys ennemys com on ylka syd And bad furth þo chylder two. Hys doyghturs proferd he that tyd, Bot thei sayd nay, thei wold non of þo. Then vnto god he cald and cryde þos byttur folkes to scheld hym fro. God mad them blynd to be So that thei toke no tent, Tyll loth with hys mene?e And þo chylder wer went. 51 When loth was passyd the Cyte playn with hys wyfe and two doghturs dere, God bad their suld not go agayn, ne of that fayr forther inquere. þos cytes sanke þer certan, And the sownd was herd, a hydwyse bere. The wyf then wyst hyr frendes wer slayn And lokyd agayn with sympyll chere. ffor scho dyd that owtrage That god bad dame do neuer, Scho wurthyd to an ymag of salt and sall be euere. 52 When loth saw how scho was dy?t þer styll to stand in a salt stone, To a hyll syd, that sogor hy?t, hys way full wysly he hath tane. þor dwellyd thei fere from all men sy?t, ffor cyty neyr them was none. The wemen wenyd no werly wy?t wer leuyd on lyfe bot them allon. þerfor, or euer the syne þe werld to fulfyll, Thei gafe ther fadyr wyne and made hym slepe full styll. 53 The eldyr systur by hym lay, The werld to maynten at hyr my?t. he delt with hyr or yt was day, And gatt A son that sythyn moab hyght. The ?onger systur then wold asay To fob hyr fader a noder nyght. Scho consauyd by þer preuay play A man that semly was to sy?t. loth leue we her at home In wastes that wer wyld And tell of abraham and of ysaac that was hys chyld. 54 Thei wentt wher thei had wonnyd be forne, And in grett lykkyng can the lend. Sara was mery euyn and morne, fforto be comford well scho kend. Bott aftur, when hyr sone was borne, Then was hyr myrth mekyll amend. ffor Agar that was wontt hyr to scorn þan had no fors hyr to defend. Sara, þat worthy wyue, when ysac my?t oght mell, Agar owt can scho dryfe with hyr sun ysmaell. 55 To flee then was scho ferly fayn; with saray durst scho not be sene. In wyldernes scho wonnyd with payn, Cared from all comforth clene. An angell gart hyr turn agayn, And bad that scho suld bowsom bene. And abraham dyd all hys mayn And mad Acord them two be twene. To gedder then thei dwell In feleschep full fayre; Grett myrth thei mad them a mell ffor ysaac theyr ayre. 56 Sythyn god hys seruand wold asay yf he to hym bowsom wold be. hee spake to abraham on A day and sayd, “thi sadnes wyll I se; Take thi sun that þou lufes well ay and make hym sacrafyce to mee. In wyldernes by syde the way A certan hyll schew sall I the. An awter þer on þou rays and offer hym me vntyll.” Abraham heyrs how he says and grauntt yt with full gud wyll. 57 Abraham vnto hys son beheld, A bold man both in bone and lyre. he wenyd that he suld haue beyn hys beld when he was old and weke o swyre; Bot vnto god he can hym ?eld, ay redy to do hys desyre. hys asse he fand furth in the feld And chargeyd hym with wud and fyre. So went thei furth in fere, qwer god bad thei suld goe. 58 ysaac saw in hys fader hand a sword and askyd hym what yt ment. he sayd, “sun, we sall make offerand To god; so hath hym selfe a sent.” “ffader”, he says, “fyr soyne we fand, bott wher ar bestes that suld be brentt?” he says, “sun, þat god hath ordand, ffor to hys frendes ay takes he tent.” So wentt þei furth þer ways; Os god wold deme þei dyd. 59 when abbraham was werre of the hyll, qwych god to hym had told be fore, The wud he tok hys sun vntyll And bad hym beyre to thei come þore hys fader forwerd to fulfyll. was he wyse, os god wold yt were. Apon that hyll on heght, os god hym self had sayd, An Auter þer on thei dyght and wud and fyre on layd. 60 When the fyre was brynnand bry?t, þan Abraham vnto god con see, And to hys sun thus sayd he ry?t, “Sun, I sall make offerand of the.” Ysaac sayd with semland lyght, “ffader, os god wyll, be houeyse yt to be. what hest to hym that ?e hath heght leffe yt no?t for luf of me.” hys sword in hand he hent So forto make offerand, Bot god his angell sent ffrom heuyn and held his hand. 61 hys sun he suld ha[ve] sacrifysyd, Bot then he wyst god wold yt not. A wedder he saw hym be syd That god had sent hym all vnsoght. þerof he made offerand that tyd, And when thei had þer wrschyp wroyght, hom agayn hely thei hyed And thankes god with wyll and toyght. Soyne aftur sara was dede and put vnto sepulcure. Abraham toke in hyr sted A wyf that heght Sethure. 62 Scho was woman wynsom to weld, Non heynder haldyn vnder heuyn, And wyls scho bode vnder hys beld, scho bayr hym sonys seuyn. Aftur when ysac wex on eld, A stalworthy man of state and steuyn, hys fader, for hys sed suld ?eld, A gu[d] wyfe to hym can he neuyn: Rebecca, A damisell— hyr fa[yr]er is not fon— The doyghtur of batuell; Nacor is his brothur son. 63 ffull sun he sent his chefe seruant ffor this mareyg to make yt clere. he wentt hym furth, and soyn he fand The maydyn at a well þor nere. hee told hyr fader of this tythand ffro Abraham, his eme full dere, how his son suld be hyr husband. þerfor þei wer full fayn in fere; wyghtly þei wer acord. the seruand soyn hyr lede vnto abraham, hys lord, and ysac with wyne hyr forto wede. 64 what worthed, qwen þei wedded were, soyn aftur sall be told vus tyll. Bot of abraham now lefe we heyre, And all his story steke we styll. When he had lyfyd A hunderth ?ere and sexty and fyue to fulfyll, Then dyed hee soyn with seknes sere And went full well with goddes wyll. Ay whyls he lyfyd in lede, euer trew was his entent, And þerfor his word and dede mun euer moyr [be] on ment. 65 ysaac lelly led his lyue in the law of god with gud entent. And rebecca, his worthy wyfe, consauyd two suns so god hir sent. Be twyx them two be gan grett stryfe with in hyr wom, or þei furth went, qwer for hyr care was kene os knyfe. scho askyd of god what yt ment. he sayd, “þou sall furth bryng two maners of pepyl expresse, And the more in all thyng sall serue vnto [the] lesse.” 66 And so yt was, os clerkes wott, The lesse was mayster of the more: ffor at þer byrth was grett debat whedder of them suld go furth be fore. Bot esau was mor strang of state, And the fyrst sted he cane restore; And Jacob þan wentt aftyr latt; þer moyder was all marryd þore. Esau, the alder chyld, was all ouer hyllyd with here; And Jacob was mor myld and soft on body and bayre. 67 Isaac had both by est and west mo catell then men my?t neuyn by name. his luf on Esaw he kast And mad hym hyrd of wyld and tame. he sett his hert on hym to rest, for he suld be heyr of the same. Bot rebecca lufyd Iacob best, for he wonnyd ay at hame. Als he satt vnder hir beld, hys dyner was well grayd. his brothyr com from the feld, And of sum part he hym prayd. 68 Bot Iacob sayd he suld haue none, oles then he wold to hym sell hys heritage and thynges ylkon that aftur hys fader vnto hym fell. Then Esau wyst no bettur wone but grauntt this connand þem a mell. with honger so he was ouergone, he tent non oþer tales to tell. When ysaac was on eld A hunderth ?ere, we fynd, Then wex hee all vnweld, and both his Eyne wer blynd. 69 H[e] callyd Esau, hys elder son, and sayd, “I wold þou went in hye Vnto the wud, os þou was wun, and take with the thyn archerye And fand to geytt me veneson, for wyld flesch ette wold I. Then sall þou haue my beneson and my blessyng be for I dy. “ffader”, he sayd, “full fayn”. þer with he went his way. The moyder with all hyr mayn wyll mar hym and scho may. 70 ffor Iacob that was hyr yonger son hath scho soght a sotell gyn: “Thy brothyr is furth for venyson, his fader blessyng forto wyn. Go to the feld; ther sall þou f[on] two fatt kyddes; bryng them or þou blyn, And In hys wedes þou sall be wonn, And so be blessyd or he com in.” “Moder”, he sayd, “nay mare þus to tell in this tyd. My brothyr is hyllyd with hayre, And I am soft of hyd. 71 All yf my fader be blynd in bed, he wyll feyle that I be no?t trew. “Deyre son,” scho sayd, “be not Adrede; my self þerfor sall schape and sew.” In kyddes skyns hys handes scho hym cled and mad a broth full gud and new. “Goe fast at thy fader wer fede and say þat þou is esau!” he dyde als scho hym bad. vnto ysaac hee wentt. “ffader, be ?e glad; heyr is mett þat ?e of ment.” 72 “A, sun,” he sayd, “well hath þou wroy?t; þi wysdom now hath þou wun.” Bot by the voce ay well hym toght yt was Iacob, his ?onger sun. he gropyd hym fast bot all for noy?t, be felyn was the falshed fun. he ette of all that he had bro?t; to blese hym then was he be gun. he mad hym ouer all oþer lord, both lowd and styll. þus begylyd he his brothyr, bot all was goddes wyll. 73 Esau veneson hath tone and broy?t his fader for his beld. “Who is þou?” he askyd on one. “ser, Esau, your eldyst chyld.” “A, son”, he sayd, “her hath ben on and brogh me flesch, full fayr and wyld. I hath hym blest, and he is gone.” the[n] wyst he well he was be gyld. “Myn heritage he hath and power ouer all oyder. Now wott I well yt was Iacob, thy ?onger brothyr.” 74 Esau then with sore syghyng sayd, “that ?e ar blynd, I by with wo. ffor now is the secund brayd that he hath me dyssauyd so. ffyrst for mett when I hym prayd, myn heritage he toke me fro, And now this tym hath me be trayd, wyls ?e bad me your arand go. well was he namyd for thy Iacob, for so he hyght That wyll geytt with gyllery that hee geyttes not with ry?t.” 75 “bot fader,” he sayd, “I pray [now yow] yf any blessyng be laft for me.” “Son, I hath gyfyn to hys be hofe wytt, wyn and oyle, all thre. And in all maters that may moue ouer all my howsha[l]d hed is he. bot in the dew of heuyn Aboue and in erth sall thi blessyng be.” The fader fulfyllyd his toy?t; the son was fayn þerfor. Thus all this werld was wroght, euyn os god wold yt wer. 76 When Esau wyst this wytterly how he hys heritag had lorne, Vnto hys brothyr he had enuy and grett malyce myde day and morn. Rebecca send Iacob for thy Into Aran, wher scho was borne, And als scho wold, hee wentt in hye. bot seyre ferlys he fand be forne. Als he lay on a land, slepand Abowtt mydnyght, A stegh he saw vp stand from erthe to heuyn on hyght. 77 That stegh began euuynly at his crown; Vnto his syght yt semyd so Als Angels wentt euyn vp and down full mony tym both to and fro. God told to hym in that seson how that he suld wede wyfes two, And how his generacion ouer all the werld suld grathly go. hee sayd, “for abraham sake that was thi fader free, whedder þou slepe or wake, thy beld ay sall I be.” 78 Than Iacob of þer maters mels and says he saw god in gud astate. And in his tale þis furth he tels and says, “by this werke well I watt That in this sted is no thyng els bot goddes awn howse and heuyn ?ate And dredfull to them that heyr dwels, bot yf þei flee fro all debate.” A stone lay at his hede; that rayssyd hee vp on end. In a tokynyng yt leuyd how god hys myrth þore mend. 79 So went he furth, and sone he fand laban and his two doghturs dere. ffor rachell was then his connand forto be seruand VII ?ere. And at the end, to vnderstand, when rachell suld haue neghyd nere, Then was lya by hym ligand: no wounder yf he schawyd [no] chere. Iacob was full euyll payd, for he had noygh his awne. Bot laban to hym sayd, this custom þor was knawne: 80 The elder systur to sett be fore in wrschype that to wemen fell. A new forward the festyd þore: oyder VII ?ere that he suld dwell To be most maystur of þer store, And then he suld resaue rachell. And forto make hym my?t more, this connand mad thei a mell: To haue yf þer fell any bestes of colours sere. Swylke mad Iacob mony. how, that ?e sall heyre. 81 When bellyng tym of bestes be gane, os men by course of kynd may neuyn, Vnto the wud he wendes then and gat hym wandes mony and euyn. The barke warly a way he wan in sonder places, VI of seuen, And sett them wher the bestes rane, and so thrugh grace of god of heuen, On the wandes ose thei lokyd and toke to them reward, Som bar blake and som brokyd, sum skellyd and sum garde. 82 By the faurt ?ere were fully gone, Iacob had catell grett plente. he toke his wyfes and welth, gud on, and karyd vnto his awn cuntre. hys wyfes had seruandes, ayther on, that seruyd them in seyre degree. Iacob for spoushed sparyd none, bot [made] them all berand to be, So that he had hym self, to rekyn old and ?onge, Of suns full semly XII; of them grett sede my?t spryng. 83 Sex of þe suns com of ly[a]: Iudas, semeon and leui, I?achar, ?abulon, ruben. all th[a] [trewly] war born of hyr body With a doghtur that heght dyna. then this two seruandes had in hy Dan, neptalyn, gad, asser, no ma; so wer þei X to tell schortly. When rachell can be gyn, then bayr þat worthy wyfe Ioseph and byniamyn; with hym scho lyfyd hyr lyfe. 84 Iacob was noyed on a ny?t in his way os he wentt: hee wrestyld with an angell brygh that his on schank was all to schent. þat angell com from heuyn on heght and told vnto hym goddes entent. I[s]raell was his name be ryght, And Iacob suld no moyr be ment. Wher for þus forther fell: all his lyneyg lese and moyre wer namyd chylder of israel in werld heyr whyls thei woyre. 85 Now in this processe or we passe, is gud the dedes forto dyscrye Of the eldyst brothyr that hyght Iudas; for on hym iones the genology. his brothyr rewll he refusyd [has] And karyd into chana[ny] And [in] that land wed he was with mekyll welth, os was worthy. his wyf was fayr and free and bayre of hyr body Thre suns semly to see; ther names heyr say sall I. 86 The fyrst hyght her, os I herd tell, and onam was the name of an oþer. Thei wer both fayr of flesch and fell. and sela men callyd the toþer. ffull mekyll myrth was them a mell, for thei had mobles mony A fo[ther]. And forther mer so yt be fell that wedd was the eldyst brothyr. he was eldyst and heyre. ther weddyd thei were, he and a woman full fayr, hyr nam[e] was thamar. 87 Moyr semly woman myght none see, yf thei suld sech on yche syde. Bot he was euyll in his degree; þerfor he my?t no langer abyd. ffor wekydly then wastyd hee the sed that suld be multiplyd. þerfor god ordand hym to be funden ded in that same tyde; ffor he rewllyd hym not ry?t, als course of kynd wyll tell. The fend on the fyrst ny?t had forse hym forto fell. 88 Then of this dole had Iudas dred And sayd vnto his secund sun, “Go þou, rayse vp thi broþer sed ose men then in this werld was wun!” Bot hee vnethly dyd his dett euyn os his brothyr had be gun; wherfor he seruyd the same mede. Or yt was day, ded was he fun. Then Iudas was full wrath when this tene was be tyde, And toght yt was grett wath to wed hyr with the thryde. 89 And he was yong to tell þat tyd; þerfor he hath consell tone: he send hyr home—[yt is] nott to hyd— to hyr fader, that scho was fro gone, And bad that scho suld þor abyd In wedohede with welth gud one. And Iudas wyfe in þos days dyed; the[n] was he wedow leuyd alone. Seruandes semly to se had his katell forto kepe, ffor he had grett plente of asses, nawtt and schepe. 90 When thamar herd thies tyghynges tell that Iudas wyf was ded hym fra, with hym then wer scho leuer to dwell then with hys yongest sun sela. Of this mater meuyd scho a mell And watyd hyr tyme for to ta. And forthermer yt so be fell that with his seruand suld he ga In clowes to clype his schepe, Als custom was þen þore. Than thamar tuke gud kepe And ordand fast þerfor. 91 Hyr wedow wedes scho layd away, and [gart] hi[r] face to schyn os glasse, [and cl]ed hyr in full rych a ray; ffor so scho trows to rape Iudas. Scho sett hyr on A somerday In the way wher he suld passe. when he hyr say, soyn can he say, “ffayr woman, all my hert þou hasse”. his seruandes gart he go be for furth on þer way, And allon leuyd bot them two to make them myrth and play. 92 Then his entent he hyr told vntyll; That yt was thamar trowd he noy?t. “Woman, and þou wyll wyrke my wyll, then sall I send the sone vnsoght A fayr kyd lame to kepe or kyll.” the woman answerd ose scho toght, “Syr, I wyll haue, as yt is skyll, A wede to byd tyll yt be broght.” he sayd, “þat sall þou haue.” he toke the be all of his herme And also his walkyng stafe; he kast both in hi[r] berme. 93 Then was scho bown what he wold byd, ffor scho kepyd to haue helpe þerby. And in that tyme so yt be tyd: tway chylder bred in hyr body. Then Iudas went and deuly dyd hys schepe clyppyng withoutyn cry. And scho wentt home and helyd and hyd all this processe preuely. Iudas a kyd then sent, as he had heght certayn. Bot the woman was went, and the kyd broy?t agayn. 94 Then Iudas was grettly agayst And wroth, for his wedd was a way. When thre mo[neth]yse wer playnly past, Then thamar feld full fell a fray: hyr wome so wex that folke full fast demyd of dede ylke day. Sum sayd that scho was gylty to god agayns þer law, And sum sayd scho wer worthy þerfor to hang and draw. 95 When Iudas herd how all þis wentt, he was full wroth, we may warrand. he bad scho suld be aftur sentt, for all the dome hang in hys hand. To tell the sothe or take iugment aftur the law of the land. Than thamar was furth broy?t, as the law was then vsyd, Bot so wysly scho wrogh that scho was well excusyd. 96 Iudas then spake with word bold And sayd, “the suth sall non man spare. Thamar, the trewth bus heyr be told. who is defawt of all þis fare?” Then schewde scho furth his bee of gold, and hys stafe had scho redy þer. Then Iudas knew all dele, and þus he sayd in hye, “by This werke now wott I uell That scho is wyser then I,” 97 “And hyr ow for to beyr no blame.” so was scho sauyd from scath and scorne. And with wrschyp scho wund at hame tyll tym hyr chylder suld be borne. The meydwyf wyst and sayd the same that scho suld haue twa men at morn. The fyrst scho gafe Phares to name by cause that come furth be forne; The secund son furth ?ede so like vnto his broþer At the mydwyfe fest A thred to knaw on fro the toþer. 98 When the secund past from his place, thei namyd hym ?aram, that þor werre. The moyder, quen hyr was ouer past, was ferly fayn that thei well farre. Then holy wrytt schews how yt was in genology of this charre, And says þus, “Iudas gendyrd has Phares and ?amar of thamar.” Then gatt þer Phares esrom. thes processe leue we playne, And tell how Iacob come to his cuntre agayn. 99 When Iacob com to his cuntre, of hys moyder dede herd he tell. Ysac, his fader, my?t no see; for febylnes son seke he fell. Ten of his suns then ordand hee to kepe his catell þam omell, And Ioseph and byniamyn to be ay styll at hom with hym to dwell. An Auter þer þei rayse to make sacrafyce, And honerd god all ways with wrschyp on þer wyse. 100 Then Ioseph dremyd with goddes wyll and says his brethyr how he beheld, how thei and he vnder A hyll geyddyrd scheffes fayr in the feld. he sayd that hys schefe stod vp styll, And XI vnto his can held. his brethyr toke gud entent þer tyll and toght that he wold wrschep weld. he sayd, “sone and the mone and oþer sternys eleuyn war bown both morn and noyne to honour [me] full euyn.” 101 The eleuyn had full grett hethyng And sayd to hym, “be lyue, lett se: What wold þou dreme of this dremyng? hoppes þou to guferne grett degree, Or þat þou sall ouer vs be kyng, And we all suggettes vnto the?” þan hatreyd in þer hertes thei hyng And toght þat bargan suld not be. Isac in hert can hyd þer steuyns and held þem styll. And what so suld be tyde, he prayd god to wyrke his wyll. 102 Bott well he trowd in his entent that dreme suld men of myghtes more. hys brethyr of grett malys ment And sayd that suld hym son ry?t sore. Sythyn on a day was Ioseph sent to se hys brethyr and als þer store. þai saw and sayd he suld be schentt for talys that he had told be fore. Bot his brothir ruben held hym owt of þer handes And sold hym to strang men, And forto led into fer landes. 103 Then all þo ten hath tane to red to feyn a falshed for þat fude, To say he was etyn in A sted with wyld bestes, os þei vnderstud. And this to maynten with holhed thei wett his coyte with kyddes blud. When Iacob herd his sun was ded, no wounder was þof he wer wude. Of hym and all þat hepe now lett we leue in hand, And tell furth how Ioseph was ledd furth into egype land. 104 Puthefar he can hym lede to pharo, that þer was kyng. That stewerd wyf for his fayrhed can waytte Ioseph in bowr to bryng. And for he wold not do in dede, In downgyn depe scho dyd hym thryng. And to hyr lord scho spake gud sped that he suld hast hym for hyng. Bot when he presond was, two felows þer he fand That wer for þer trespasse haldyn full herd in band. 105 The kyng was with ther werkes wrath; butler and baker þer namys [þei] call. A pon a nyght þei dremyd bath And told yt furth to grett and small. And Ioseph rede ther dremys full rath and sayd what son suld aftur fall: The butler forto scape [all scathe], and the baker to by for all. So was the butler ryght resauyd the kyng be forne; The bakster, als he heght, was hangyd at morne. 106 Sythyn dremyd the kyng An oþer ny?t, that mad hym meruell in his mode. hym toght he saw A selcoth syght: seuyn bestes [fatt com] from the f[lo]de, And aftur them saw he ryght seuyn bestes leyne for fawt of fude. Bot the leyn ware moyr of my?t And stroyd the fatt euyn os thei stud. his dreme he told [the clerkes] to constru by clergy, Bott non cowd wytt what werkes that syght suld sygnyfye. 107 The butler spake then for his sped, “lord, in your preson lyges in [b]end A lele man of the ebrew lede; Of this mater can he make end.” Then was Ioseph tan forto rede this consell, ose the butler kend. he bad the kyng tent and take hede how god suld in seuyn wyntur send Of catell, corne plente, all men to weld at wyll; And oþer seuyn, sayd hee, men suld for hu[n]gur spyll. 108 And when the kyng can vnderstand þat swylke defawt suld aftur fall, he mad hym stewerd of his land, all men to come at his call. Then in fyrst seuyn ?ere he ordand And geydderd corne of grett and small, Wher with the folke ther fud he fand Whyls hungur was in werld ouer all. hys kyn in canaan for hungur was nere lorne. his fader herd tell then that in egyp was corne. 109 Ten of hys suns sent he [þer] þen for corn yf þei þerby my?t wyn. To wen þei were full mere men, Non leuyd at home bot byngemyn. when Ioseph saw his brethyr ten, he knew all comyn of a kyne. Bot none of them cowd hym kene, for hegh a state þat he was in. he askyd them when þai come. Ruben and noe noþer, he sayd, “ser, we haue at home our fader and our yongest brothyr.” 110 “That we were twelfe cownt we cane, bot on was dede, drownd in a dale, with wyld bestes in chanaan; for hym our fader hath mekyll bale.” When Ioseph herd, he wyst well þan how that his fader in hele was hale. In werld was not A myryer man; “bott ferther,” he toght, “asay I sall.” he toght to geddyr them, bryng Beniamyn hym be forne, ffor þai twa was most yong And both of Rachell borne. 111 he sayd, “for soth, I sall you spyll bot yf ?e be to my bedyng bayn. ffyrst your sekkes sall I do fyll of corne to make your fader fayn. Bryngys þan Beniamyn me vntyll; That yong boy wyll I se certayn. And symeon, he sall heyr byd styll In preson tyll ?e come agayn.” þus sayd he to asay yf þer luf war fyne Vnto þer fader all way, and to that barne Beniamyn. 112 Thei wentt furth, os he can them warn; þer was no consell forto craue. þai told þer fader how þai had farn, And symeon laft, þem all to sayue; And them bad bryng the yongest barne, his helpe or hele yf þei wold haue. The fader toght loth hym to tharn; ffor rowth he remyd als he wold raue. Ther syluer, that þei noy?t wyst, was in þer sekkes certayn. That made hym haue moyr trest to send them saue agayn. 113 A gayn þei wentt full fayr in fere hertly to hold os þei had heght. Then Iacob satt with sympyll chere, full drery both day and nyght. Tyll egypt son þei neghyd nere, And to Ioseph þei went full wyght. Of beniamyn his brothyr dere had he grett hast to haue a syght. Bot þat he was þer brothyr wold not he lett be herd, Bot askyd euer on and oþer how þer fader ferd. 114 þer sekes he dyd to fyll that tyd and bad them wend þer way with wyn with symeon, that was be syd. bot hastely þer blys can blyn. A cupe of gold gart he then hyd with In the seke of beniamyn So with that gawd to garre hym byd, ffor he toght þei twa suld not twyn. In þer way as þei wentt And trowd of nokyns trayne, Sun armyd men war sentt And broy?t then beniamyn agayn. 115 To Ioseph fell þei down be dene, and he lett os he lufyd þem noy?t. Vnto þem carpyd he wordes kene and sayd, “fals thefes, what was your toght; yow forto beld bown haue I bene, and wekydly heyr haue ?e wroght, And of your selfe yt sall be sene.” als he dyd þer sekkes be soght, his cowpe was fun with schame in the yongest brothir seke. Ioseph sayd he þat same suld hyng hegh by the neke. 116 Iudas sayd, “mercy lord, lett be; lett vs not lose that lytyll knaue. Our fader toke hym vnto me; I hyght hym sothly hym for to sayue, And sertes bott yf he sound hym see, ffull sune sall he be grathyd in graue. lett hym go home, and dwell wyll we In hold, wher so ?e wyll vs haue. When Ioseph wyst þer wyll And saw them wepe so soyre: “Brethyr,” he sayd, “be styll and mowne ?e yow no more.” 117 This tokyn to them he told, “when my fader to feld me sent, I am the same man ?e sold for XX pennys of payment.” Then all þer hertes be gan to cald; ffull well þei hopyd to haue ben schent. Bot Ioseph say[d] þen, “brethyr, be bold; I forgyf yow with gud entent.” þei kyssyd and for ioy grett; myrth was them a mange. And þus þis mene?e mett that mekyll spech of sprange. 118 Then Ioseph sent his brethir ten to foche his fader, wher þei hym fand, And all þer kyn þat þei cowd ken gart he bryng into egyp land. And in on yle that hyght Iessen, þor was þer wunyng well ordand. his dreme was fayr fulfyllyd þen, for all þei heldyd to his hand. When Iacob das war weryd vnto a C XL and [VII], he dyed and was enterd in chanan, wher he had bene. 119 Then had Ioseph welth in weld of gold and syluer and gud store. his brethyr gudly can hym be held with men and wyfes þat with them were. And aftur whe[n] he was of eld, A hunderth ?er [and X], no more, his saule to god then can he ?eld, Als all his helders had don be fore. his brethyr ylkon with In schort tym war dede; Bott folke war full gud one that com of þer kynred. 120 And þo þat aftur them can dwell, þei myltyplyd ay mo and moe, And wer namyd chylder of israel, for Iacob name was schon[ge]d so. þei mad grett mornyng them a mell, for Ioseph was so fer them fro, ffor aftur werd, os men may tell, þer welth was turn to wer and wo. þis buke then ende we þus, that is namyd genesis. To be gyn Exodus god with his wyll vs wysch. Exodus incepit. 121 When Ioseph and hys brethyr ylkon wer ded, then com þer A new kyng. Of Ioseph wyst he ry?t none, ne noy?t wold knaw of his comyng. Bot he leuyd, and þai my?t allone, þer kynred suld ouercome all thyng. þerfor he hath the consell tone In gre[t] thraldom them forto bryng. he gart them beyre and draw And do both dyke and delue, So forto hald the law And lose ther lyneg twelfe. 122 Now wer thei sett in sorow sere; þei fand neuer of defawt be forne. And so thei fayr IIII C ?ere with grett myschefe mydday and morne. Bot vnto god ay war thei dere, All that of þat blud was borne: hee multiplyed in all maner them selfe, þer catell and þer corne. The kyng was kend by clerkes A chyld of them suld spryng To wast hym and his werkes and vnto bale hym bryng. 123 To lett this harme then ordand hee All man kynd in þer byrth to qwell That of the israel borne suld be, [bot] All woman kynd to dwell. A man wonnyd in that same Cyte; heght [am]ryn and his wyfe Iacabell. Scho bare a sun semly to see, by qwom seyr farlys aftur fell. Thre monethes thei hym hyd, and lengur thei durst not abyd Bott in a case hy[m] dyd and layd hym by the see syd. 124 The kyng had [then] a doyghtur dere, Tremouth scho heght, os I herd say. with hyr maydyns fayr in fere In that place wentt scho to play. Thei saw the case in watur clere In poynt to falle and flett a way. At hyr byddyng thei broy?t yt nere; A full fayr chyld þer in fand þei. ffor hyr sun scho yt chese and was full mery in mode And gart nam[e] yt moyses als funleng of the flud. 125 The lady trowd full well that tyd that yt was on of ebreus lede, And at þei sent yt so to hyd And durst no noþer do for dred. Scho sent to lades on ylka syd the chyld to norysch and furth fede. Bot the barn wold not with them abyd, ne towch þer pape[s] for nokyns nede. Then had the lady kare; that sy?t full sore hyr rewys. Scho bad them seke yt ay whare A noryse of Ebreus. 126 This chyldes systur, A damsell, then with that lady was dwelland. Scho herd how all this ferly be fell, And socur sone þerfor scho fand. Scho mad hyr moder Iacabell that chyld to warysch and warrand. The lady dy[d] hym with hyr dwell And payd hyr hyre in hyr hand. The chyld with all his mayn fell to the pappe full nere. Then was that lady fayn; so wer all foure in fere. 127 ffor he to sowke so had be gun, The lady bad no bettur ?ele. The chyld was fayn when he had fown the moder pappe fully to fele. The systur wyst how þei had wonn hyr brothyr lyfe, that lykyd hyr well. Bot the moder was most fayn of hyr sun, that scho went had been drownd ylk dele. Scho fosterd hym full fayre tyll he cowd styr and stand. To court then can scho care, als the lady had hyr cunnand. 128 ffor all þer consell well scho knew; Vnto the lady scho hym toke. And Tremowth toke hym for hyr trew and for hyr sun hym neuer for suke. he was so fayr of hyd and hew: all men had lyst on hym to loke. Be for his tyme was neuer Iew so fayr to sy?t, so says the boke. And yf men my?t hym see, that were sory of[t] sy[the]. Trugh blyse of his bewty thei suld be glade and blythe. 129 So yt be fell a pon a day: the kyng and the lordes that [with] hym wore Sat in the palys them to play, and cunnand clerkes was with them þore. A damsell in rych a ray broght the chyld them furth be fore. And [of] that fayr full fayn war thei, for all men lufyd hym, lese and more. The kyng can on hym loke and was ryght glad for þi. In hand sone he hym toke and kyssyd hym curtasly. 130 Be twyx hys schankes he sett hym ry?t and lappyd hym to hym for grett lufe. And for he was so worthy a wyght, hys pertenes he toght forto proue. his crown of gold, full fayr and bryght, that barne hed sett he a boue. And sone was schewyd in þer sy?t A wonder case forto controue: That chyld full lyghtly lete, the crown kast he downe And fylyd yt with his fete forto breke yt full bowne. 131 So qwen thies clerkes this sy?t can see, Vnto the kyng thei [said] full sone, “Syr, wott þou not we wernyd the with on Ebrew to be vn downe? Se this sygne, that same is hee; þerfor be wyse with wordes fone. hys bane belyu bot yf þou be, thynke þor to abyd n[o] bettur bone. The case sen þou knavs, rewle the by ryghwyse rede.” The kyng sees by þer sawys that barne behouys to be ded. 132 Then a wys man of þer law Sayd the chyld suld not be schent. This dede that he hath done þis day, yt [ys] not doyn be yll entent; That sall be seyn sone on a say. hott colys he gart bryn[g] in present And proferd the chyld [with] forto play. And in his mowth he soyn þem hentt. he kyd well he was yong, And no man wold hym marre; The coylys brynt so his tong that he spake euer the warre. 133 This mater sone was mouyd and ment In chamber emang this madyns all. Tremuth toke þerto full gud tent, And fast scho hyed into the hall. The chyld in ermys sone hath scho hent ffor no defawt to hym suld fall. loe, how sone god hath socur sent; that he wyll saue, be sauyd thei sall. To chamber scho hym bare; Then was he owt of drede. All that the clerkes sayd ayre was aftur done in dede. 134 Scho was full fayn to be his belde, And in hyr boure scho cane hym hyde, Tyll he was waxin well of eld. was none so semly in no syde; All folke had hele that hym be held; so was he fayr of hew and hyde. And sythyn when he my?t wepyns weld, he mustyrd manhed mony a tyde. And on a day yt be tyd he hard and was nerhand how on of egypt chyd with a chyld of his land. 135 Then moyses meud hym þem omell both for his kyn and his cuntre. The man of egypt can he qwell And hyde hym that none suld see. ffull soyne the kyng þerof herd tell And demed that moyses ded suld be. And þer he durst no langer dwell, bot fast to madian hastyd hee, A Cyte sett be fore vnder oreb hyll to be. Getro was byschope þore and gouerynd grett degre. 136 hys doyghtyrs [keped] his fee in feld, os custom was þa[n] cum[on]ly. The wemen my?t no watur weld for hyrdmen that ware moyr myghty. Then moyses stud and them beheld And helpyd the wemen with maystry. þei told þer fader vnder teld, And [he] bad bryng hym home in hye. Sythyn Getro gafe hym to hys doghtur, heght Cephoram. Scho bare hym chylder two, Elia?ar and gersam. 137 with hym laft moyses for his lay to be hys hyrd, yt is not to hyd, Als his doghturs wer wontt all way. ffor wrschyp was [yt] cald þat tyde. with his schepe wentt he on a day Vnder the monte of Synay syde. þer fand he farlys hym to flay; Abayst he was þer for to abyde. A buske he saw vp stand with floures and leues grene, And that buske was byrnand, bo[t] sulpyng was none sene. 138 Of meruyll my?t no man hym blame; swyl[k] ferlis ner be fore hym fell. God carpyd to hym and cald by name with In a buske wher he can dwell, “Moyses, I am god the same Of Abraham, ysac and israel; ffor the chylder that suffers schame all myn entent I sall the tell. I wyll mustyr my my?t and owt of bale them bryng, Als I be fore hath heyght to them and þere ofspryng.” 139 “My messynger I wyll make the to pharo of egypt kyng: To byd hym lett my folke go free owt of his land at þer lykyng, To make þer sacrafyce to me In wyldernese of werldly thyng. Thy brothyr Aron sall with the be and beyr wytnese to old and ?yng how þou spekkes with me here, and yf þei trow the noght, Sygnes, sore and sere, sall I send soyne vn soght.” 140 Then sayd moyses, “lord, vnderstand this; I wold sum oþer wentt. þei lufe me noy?t in egypt land, vnto my talys þei wyll not tent.” he bad hym then cast down his wand, And sone yt semyd os a serpent. And mesyll lyke yt made his hand to apeyre in the kynges present. “yf þei aske the of whom þou had þ[e]ir segnes and whore, Say, ‘I am that am’; that is my name euer moyre.” 141 Moyses says, “it sall be done in this case, ose þou hath commawnd.” he toke his leue at Getron and held the way to egypt land. Als god hym heyght, his brothir Aron euyn in the way be for hym he fand. Of his fader and his kyn ylkon he told to hym full gud tythand, And how all his enmys wer dede and done a way. And he told on what wyse god sent hym for say. 142 his fader and all hys frendes wer fayn of his cummyng to that cuntre. he sayd he suld them bryng from payn vnto a place of grett plente. And to fulfyll the purpase playn to pharo went aron and hee, And schewyd to hym the segnes certayn wylke god bad þei suld lett hym see. “ffor the schylder of israel,” þei [say], “god sentt vs hase.” Bot for oght þei cowd tell, he sayd þei suld not pase. 143 Moyses þen cast down his wand, And soyne it semyd os a serpent. he toke the tayle vp in his hand, and ase a wand agayn yt went. As mesyll furth his fyngurs stand, And hole a gayn [sone] he þem hentt. The kyng sayd he hade clerkes connand cowd do the same by experiment. he sett þer segnes at noy?t And sayd þer folke þerfore Suld be in bondon broy?t wele wers þen euer thei were. 144 God sent vnto them veniance ten [so forto make theym turne theire moode.]— all the waters of egypt then In feld and towne were turnd into blude So that it myght [noght] helpe to men, Ne vnto bestes, ne fowles fode. Bot swylke faw[t] fell not in Jessen, Wher þei wonyd that to god wer gud. The secund soyne can fall to greue [þem] als god wyld: Both feld, hows and hall with taydes and froskes wer fyllyd. 145 All was venomd with the vermyne that suld oght reche þer releue. Bot pharo þerfor wold not fyne, bot goddes folke more then can he greue. Then the thryd god send þem s[y]ne: grett myse that made þem mor myschefe. þei stroyd and corumpyd both corn and wyne. No man my?t for þer malice meue. No thyng my?t [byd þer byte] yf þei safe aftur suld be. Bot pharo wold not ?ett þerfor lett this folke go free. 146 he sayd he suld them bynd in band; god send the faurt veniance for thye: grett fleand loppes ouer all the land, batte men and bestes full bytturly. Wher so þei fell on fott or hand, ffull hedos herm had þei in hye. Bott goddes folke non swylke fawtes fand; þei wonnyd in well, as was worthy. Kyng pharo was frowerd and euer of wekyd wyll. his hert was mad so herd: goddes folke ay haldes he styll. 147 þerfor the fyft co[me] aftur fa[st], þat well wers then any oþer was. Moran was ouer þer catell kast, on schepe, swyn, oxe and asse So that in lyfe þer my?t none last. the kyng þerof most herme has, Bot when this perell was ouerpast, he wold not lett the pepyll pase. þerfor the sext was sene: when moyses mouyd his wand, A powder yll and vnclene was cast ouer all the land. 148 That powder blew ouer all by lyue; wher so yt blew, [sone] wex a [blayne]. yt mad like messels man and wyfe þat ware not to goddes bedyng bayn. Both ny?t and day swylke dust can dryue. than was the seuynt of frost [and rayn] with hale stons that dyd them str[yv]e; wher so þei bett, þei brast þer brayn. Swylk thonour and lefynyng in all that land was wroght [That herbes and all maner of thyng was waist and broght to noght.] 149 The aght was yll wormes fleand; þei couerd ouer all þat cuntre. Agayns the storme my?t no thyng stand: þei left no fruttes, ne leuys on tre. The IX [then] fell neyr at hand: so marke that none my?t oþer see; No ly?t was leuyd in all þat land, And that enduryd by days thre. The tent was sodan ded of all folke, fo and frend. Then toke the kyng to red to lett the pepyll wend. 150 The kyng gafe leue vnto moysen and Aron to wend os þei [wold]. On mold wer non more meri men fro tym [þei herd] þer talys bee [told]. þei hyghed þem fast vnto Jessen, wher the Jewes wonnyd both ?ing and old, And sett þem certan tyms and when to wend, and bad þei suld be bold To borow and with þem beyre All guds þat þei my?t gette. And so ordand thei here full smartly small and grette. 151 Sexti and ten in yowth and eld wer told when þei enturd þat land. Now wer þei that my?t wepyn weld to reckynd thre C thowssand, Owttakyn wemen and hyrdes in feld and chylder that in [n]a stoure my?t stand. þei prayd all god to be þer beld, And furth þei went, as was ordand. On days at þer desyre with all fudes wer þei fede; On nyghtys with flawme of fyre in lyghtnes ware þei lede. 152 When pharo wyst that þei wendyd ware, moyses and aron and ilka iew, he commawndyd all men, both lesse and mare, aftur þat pepyll forto persew with chares and mules and mekyll store. to the greke se he gart remew. ffull well he hopyd to haue þem þore, for kyndly course no ferre he knew. he sayd, “forsoth, we sall bynd them full soyre in bandes.” Bot god that gouerans all, he sauys ay his seruandes. 153 when þei herd, yt is not to hyd, the kyng was command on swylke a wyse, þei saw the see on þat on syde and on þat oþer all þer enmys, ffor ferd full fast þen can þei chyde and sayd, “oure lyuys not lang l[yse]; Bettur had vs ben forto byde and [haue] bene sauyd in the kyng seruyce. þei wend moyses had wyst and tylyd þem furth with trayne. hee sayd, “be ?e of gud trest; god sall vs saue certayn.” 154 To god he bad þem crye and call, and to the see wyghtly he wentt. hys wand he lete in the watur fall and prayd to god with gud entent. The watur stud vpe ose a walle: swylke grace god to þem þor sentt. Thurght owt þe see so wentt þei all þat nowdyr chyld ne wyf wer schent. Pharo con aftur fownd and trowd well þem to haue tane. he and his mene?e wer drownyd; on lyfe þer lafte not one. 155 When Moyses and all hys mene?e stud on land and lokyd agayn And saw how þei ware past the see, and all þer enmys sleghly slayn, To call on god þen commawnd hee, and this songe sayd he certayn: “Cantemus domino gloriose, loue we god and his power playne, That sauys vs on this wyse owt of all wo to wende, And hath stroyd our enmys that soght vs forto schend.” 156 Moyses þus and hys folke in fere mad joy to god, both moyre and lesse. So wentt þei furth and neghed nere A forest that was fayr to gese. þore fand þei wellys, fayr and clere, with watur semand fayr and fresche. Bot to asay on sydes sere, yt was all blend with bytturnese. þat gart þem be grochand and murmerand in þer mode. Then moyses with hys wand thrugh goddes grace made yt gude. 157 þus louyd þei god of all his grace [þat for þem] wroght swylke werkes grett. þei [soiourned] þore a certayn space tyll þei were rest and well refette. Sythyn past þei vnto a noþer place, A forest of syne, was fere to gette, And þore thei[m] fell a febyll case, defawtt of fude, both drynke and mette. Bot god herd moyses steuyn, and Aron helpe he wold. he send þem foyde fro heuyn, flour that manna was cald. 158 þore fell be fore þem foulys sere, aftur þer lyst and lykyng was. And so þei were fede XL ?ere, ay qwyls þei wonnyd in wyldernese; þer cloghyng was euer in lyke clere, And euer þer fude was fayr and fresche. So wer þ[e] folke fede fayre in fere; þer bestes lyue[d] with grouand gresse. þen past þei furth fro Syn, a forest fayr and wyde, To the forest of raphadyn, and þore þei buskyd to abyde. 159 Watur be for þem [fand þei non] in ryuer, ne in dyke to stande. þerfor þei mournyd and mad grett mone. To moyses ware þei all grochand. God spake to moyses and aron and bad that he suld with his wand Before the folke stryke on the ston, and watur suld he haue at hande. Moyses sayd, “men take tent to me, both most and lest.” he stroke, and watur went owt both to man and beste. 160 ffor moyses sayd, “to me take hede,” And mad no mynd of goddes myght, God spake vnto hym þer gud sped and reckynd to hym this reson ry?t, “ffor þat þou demyd not of this dede þat yt be me was done and dyght, my folke, I say, þou sall not lede Into the land that [I]þem heght.” Then word of them sprang in Cytys on ylka syde. þai say, “yf thei last lang, our remys þei sall ouer ryde.” 161 ffaure kynges hath horssus and harnes hent, Amalec and oþer thre. þei say, “this ebrews sall be schentt, bot yf thei sped þem fast to flee.” Bot moyses sone hys men hath sentt and made þer cheftan Josue. he prayd at home with gud entent so that the vyctory hade hee. Whyls moyses held hys hende vp vnto heuyn on hyghte, þer my?t non enmys lend agaynys hys folke to fyght. 162 Iosue ouercom all þos enmyse, and full grett welth he wan þerby Of catell and of cloghes of price, And home agayn fast can þei hye. Moyses gart make grett sacrafyce, ffor god had ?[y]fyn þem the victory, And ordand pristys and princis wyse forto kepe furth þer cumpany. Getro of madian, þat moyses founded fro, he soght vnto hym þen with wyf and chylder also. 163 Aftur that tyme þei toke the ways wher the montt of synay was nere, wher moyses for the pepyll prays, and god vnto hym þor can apeyre. he fastyd full faurty days, the law of god for he wold lere. Then commawndmentes, os clerkes says, war to hym takyn in tables sere. Bot whyls he þor can dwell to lere goddes laws lely, hys folke full fowll fell and made þem mawmentry. 164 A calf of gold þei gart vp stand and honerd yt with all þer mayne. “þis broy?t vs owt of egyp land and sall vs saue”, þei say, “certayn.” þen god vnto moyses commawnd, “wend down vnto þi pepyll agayn, ffor þei haue synnyd and tone on hand a werke that wyll wurth to payn.” Moyses þen from god past and hyed hym to þat halfe. he fand his folke full fast kneland be for þat calfe. 165 þat mawmentry þat þei of ment was hedows thyng [to] hym at here. he brake þer calfe and sone yt brent and kest the powder in watur clere. þei dranke þer of euer os þei went, for oþer watur was non so nere. [On] þos þat to þat syn assent the veniance of god cane apere, ffor he wald haue þem spylt aftur þer awne desyre. The berdes of þem wer gylt like vnto the gold wyre. 166 when moyses and his broþer Aron saw sygne of god in þat sted, Oþer wyttenese nede þem none bot at þer here was waxin rede. of þem that was [with] tresone tone and bold to breke that moyses bede, ware XXIII milia sloyne; þen wer the remland wyll of rede. To fete þei can þe[m] fal[d]. and moyses gatte [þem] grace, And þen to þem he told how god spake in þat space. 167 A[n] arke, he sayd, þei suld do make, þer in to hold þat holy store: The tables þat god can to hym take, with manna and with mekyll more. All þer sacrafyce for goddes sake and all þat offerd suld be þore. And þer with suld none wune ne wake bot folke þat were ordand þerfor. This arke þei made in hye of gold and prescius stone. The lynege of leuy to tent þerto was tone. 168 Aron was ordand byschop to be forto resaue the sacrafyce, And prestes and dekyns in þer degree at serue to hym in sere seruyce. And ryght so the duke Josue was chosyn os a prince and most in price, wher so þei come in ylke cuntre to sett the batels in asyce. A tabernakyll þei toke to kepe godes arke ay clene. So endes the secund boke, þat of moyses wyll mene. Numeri. 169 When moyses þus had ordand all full cunnandly os he well can Vnto goddes seruyce what suld fall, and what to werres that wrschyp wan, Then remeuyd þei both grett and small to A forest þat heght faran. þer tabernakyll þer can þei stall; with the arke of god þus þei be gane. god bad moyses, [hys jew], suld fayre on the feld And nowmer his men all new, All þat my?t weppyns weld. 170 þen moyses dyd os god commaund: he toke all þat past XX ?ere VI C and III milia Acowntyd of knyghtes in armys clere, And fyghand folke on fote he fand sex hunderth and V milia in fere, with outyn clerkes þat were ordand to serue god on sydes sere. And [þei] wer told be tale, of the lynage of leuy, To XXX milia hale; þat was a fayr cumpany. 171 Sone aftur þen begane debate: Aron and his systur mary Moyses, þer broþer, can þei hate and had to hym full grett enuy. þei say it falys not for his astate, and als þat he was not worthy To gouerand þem and gyd all gatte or forto make ouer þem maystry. þei sayd he was to bold at bryng þem from þer blyse To suffer hungur and cald, and all þer myrth to mysse. 172 ffor þis defawt gret veniance fell, os god hym se[l]f vowched saue to send: Mary all sone was fowl mesell, and þat endured VIII days to ende. When Aron saw þis and herd tell, hy[s] awn defawt well [he] kend; To moyses fette fast dow[n] he fell and prayd to god his myse to amend. Then moyses for hym prayd And for his systur also. lepur þat on hyr was layde full tytt was tane hyr fro. 173 Then made þei myrth euerylka man and toke þer tentes in þat tyde And flytted furth fro faran vnto a forest fast be syde. And fude enogh þer fand þei þan; þei beld þem þor a whyle to abyde. þer my?t þei se to canan, qwylke god had hey?t þem not to hyde. Bot þei fand fandyng or tyme þat þei come þore. þen moyses mad gedderyng of all folke hym before. 174 And sayd, “sers, ?e sall vnderstand how god hath sent yow solace sere, þat led yow owt of Egypt land fro pharo and his folke in fere And broy?t yow sou[nd]ly ouer the sand, when all drowned þat your enmys were. And for your hele he hath ordand, and for your fode, þis fawrte ?ere. And thynk als on þis thyng how your elders and ?e hath groned and made gruchyng both vnto god and me.” 175 “þerfor all myse forto amend honers hym euer with all your my?t And kepe his law ose I hath kend in word and dede both day and ny?t. And certan men I rede we send to serche the land that he hath hey?t, And se how the folke may þem dyffend and aftur þer rede rewle vs ry?t.” Josue toke he þen and Calafe to wende ydder. The folke toke oþer ten and send furth all to geydder. 176 In canan þer cowrse þei cast and soy?t the land in lengh and brede. By fawrty days war fully past, had þei notyd all þat was nede. The ten com fyrst, [þat] went furth last, and to moyses þei spake gud spede. The folke þen floked abowt þem fast All forto herkyn and take hede; And frayned how þei had faryn owt in the vncuth land, And yf þei suld yt tharne, or haue yt in þer hand. 177 The ten þen can þer tales tell, þat stound þem gretly in þer steuyn. þei sayd þer was not in to dwell a bettur land vnder heuyn, ffor þor was wyn and watur of well, whett and oyle all ordand euyn, Bot at the folke ware ferse and fell, and Nowmer of þem my?t no man neuyn. “þei ar wytty of were and well of armys kend; hors, scheld and spere haue þei redy at hend. 178 þei ar so grett on grone to gang; we seme bo[t] barns to þer bodes. And þer Cetes ar sett so strong; þei cownt no cumyng of enmys. yt is no tyme to tary lang to loke wher no releue lyse.” þen wax þor murmur þ[em] a mang, as rebels þei be gan to ryse. And to moyses þei [say], “how durst þou do this thyng, þus traturly [be tray] vs all and our of spryng?” 179 “We my?t haue lyued in egypt land and gouernd vs in gud degre. Now hath þou stald vs heyr to stand to dye in payn and pouerte.” To kyll hym haue þei made connande. so come Calafe and Josue. þei toke vnto [þem] new tythand and bade abayst þei suld not be. “Yf ?e in trewth be ry?t and to god call and craue, The land that he hath hey?t, þat hette we you to haue.” 180 “ffor all the ways os we can wend, we fand fell folke full of enuy And grett, bot god is not þer frend, for þei lyfe all in mawmentry. þer Cetys sone [we] sall do schend and stroye þer borows by and by. ffor þei ar folke full of þe fende, and in god sall we fast afy, Sen þat he fayled vs neuer, In stowre when we war stede; he wyll be with vs euer.” þen war the rebels rade. 181 To moyses fette þei fell in hye and mad grett sorow in goddes sy?t. Then moyses prayd god allmyghty forto haue pety of þer ply?t. God answerd to hym opynly and sayd, “for þat þou trawd not ry?t, þer sall none of þat cumpany cume in the land, qwylk I haue hey?t. þoo ten þat told tythand my folke so to greue, þei sall lend in this land with mornyng and myscheue.” 182 “And all þat trowde vnto þer tale to tene moyses, my seruant dere, here sall þei abyd and be in bale. all þat ar past ouer thryty ?ere, þer chylder and þer heyrys all, sall fyll that land both ferr and nere. Josue and Calafe þei tway sall be souerans in all sydes sere; ffor þei went wysly þore and told yow trew thythand; þei and þer heyrys euer more sall be lordes of þat land.” 183 Then all þo rebels þem repent and prayd to god for bettur bone. Bot to þer tales toke he no tent; als he had demed, so most yt be [done]. And neuer the lesse ly?t he þem lent a bowt mydny?t with owtyn moyne, And fresche watur wher so þei went, and fode, yf þat þei wer fele or fone, Euyn at þer awn likyng aftur þer tonges wold tast, And keped ay þer cloghyng withowtyn wem or wast. 184 ffor þis debate be gan to be grett murmur all þos men amang. A crewell man þat hey?t Core agayn moyses moued mekyll wrang. ffull rych he was of gold and fee; þerfor he toy?t hym self more strang And mekyll more worthy þen hee to gouarn folke and for þe[m] gang. he gatte of hys assent Datan and abyron, And told þem his entent, and gart þem fondly fon. 185 Tway hunderth rebels gart he ryse and fyfty at þer steuyn to stand. To þe tabernakyll, as wreches vn wyse, went þei furth to make offerand. þei senssed þor and dyd seruyce, as byschoppes had be fore ordand, And sayd aron was not of price swylk werkkes to take on hand, Bot Core suld be þen þer hed, os hym well aw, And abyron and datan byschoppes to led [þer] law. 186 God was not of þat purpasse payd; þerfor yt turned þem vnto tene. Moyses and aron to þem sayd, “sers, ?e wot well with owtyn wene Thrugh grace of god we two war grayd to be in state as we haue bene. yf any oþer be bettur arayd, to morn þen sall the soth be sene.” To come þen haue þei hy?t on the morn, both lest and mast. Bot god ordand þat ny?t that all þat werke was wast. 187 God send his veniance sone certan wher Datan and abyron can dwell. The erth opynd, yt is not to layn, And sodanly þei sanke to hell And all þat of þer fayr ware fayn, wyf and chyld down with þem fell. The erthe sone was closed agayn; þer was no tokyn of to tell. Bot Core come on the morne with fe[le] folke on fotte, As connand was be forne, agayns moyses to mote. 188 Moyses spake þen vnto Core and to two hunderth and fyfty, “Gose, both my broþer aron and ?e, and gyfe sense vnto god allmighty, And by sume seyn þen sall we se qwylke man of all þis cumpany ys best worthy byschop to be!” to this asent þei sayd in hy. Vnto the tabernakyll full tytt þei toke the way. God send full sone merakyll þos fals folke to afflay. 189 As Core to the Auter went for to gyfe [sense] as sufferan syre, A sodan fyre from heuyn was sent and brent þem vp both bone and lyre. Two hunderth and fyfty war schent with oþer þat dyd þer desyre. ?et ware þei mo þat malyce ment agayns moyses with grett yre. To be soueran, þei sayd, he had ouer grett gylt, ffor he had þor betrayd þer folke and fowle spylt. 190 her for full hyddos herme þei haue: thonour and lefnyng down dyscend And stroyd þem vp, both kny?t and knaue. þen moyses all mys [to] amend Gart kepe the sensurs, who so wold craue, in the arke of god to be kene how god wyll euer his seruant saue and fro þer face ay þem dyffend. And þus this story twyns þat is cald Numeri, And a new boke be gynnys þat is named Dewtronomij. Devtronomij. 191 þoo folke fulfylled with felony þat god fed XL ?er before. To moyses had þei euer enuy and vnto aron mekyll more. Thei sayd all he was vnworthy to be þer sufferan byschop þore. Then moyses had ordand in hye to wytt of god qwylke worthy ware. “lordyns”, he sayd, “take tent to stynt this stryuyng strang; ffro god sall grace be sentt who dos well, and who wrang.” 192 “To morne I byd þer be ordand, of all the kynrendys of aleuyn A man to take þer cawse on hand In all þat nedfull is to neuyn, And ylkon of þem bryng a wand Into the arke of god of heuyn. Aron, my broþer, his sall stand als for the twelft; þen ar þei euyn. ylk man, þat þei not myse, sall wrytt his kynraden name, And Aron sall wrytt on hys leuy and lay þat same.” 193 So on the morn þei mett on ond, the XI princese mekyll of price. And ylkon wrott with in his wand, And Aron wand for leuy lese. þen vnto moyses war þei tane as formost wytte and most wyse. In the arke of god he layd ylkon And closed yt at þer a[wn] deuyse. þei prade with hert and hend, ylkon in þer degree, þat god sume seyn suld send who suld þer byschope be. 194 ffull sone on the morne þei com clene þat specialte to spyre and spye. The aleuyn princes all be dene fand all þer wandes ded and drye. Bot Aron wand bayr leues grene and flowrs fayr to sy?t semly. þerby þei wyst withowtyn wene god lufed the lyneg of leuy. þat wand was done to tent in the arke of the tabernakyll, ffor yt suld be on ment how god dyd þer merakyll. 195 þen sessed þer stryue, yf yt ware late, Agayns Aron, þat ay was clene, And he stud styll in his astate, byschop os he had eyr bene. To Cades þen þei toke the gatte, A soyle þat was full seldom sene. And þer began A new debate for watur wantyng, os I wene. Then moyses, os god wold, owt of the roche full ryfe Broy?t watur, qwylke was cald All way the watur of stryfe. 196 Be cawse of stryuyng in þat stede a gayns moyses with yll entent, þor moyses systur Mary was dede; for hyr mekyll mone was ment. And aron sone wex wyll of rede ffor eld and seknes þat was sentt. he dyed with mony bowsom bede; we hope his sawle to welth is went. his soyne Eleaser to byschope þen chase þei. And how þei forthermer fare, ?ett sume dele sall we say. 197 herrott, the kyng of cananews, when he herd tell the new tythand how moyses come with mony jewes and wold with strengh dystroy his land, With þem wold he take no trewse, b[ot] sone his ost he had ordand. And moyses furth his men remeuys tyll þei þoo folke on feldes fand. Sone ware þei in prese, and full smertly can smytte. The ouerhand had moyses, and the kyng was dyscumfete. 198 þor gatte þei gudes full grett plente, and for þat welth þei wold not fyne, Bot furthe þei sewed more forto se, and þat suyng þei [r]owed syne. ffor þei come in a wast cuntre, wher þei fand noþer bred ne wyne. þerfor be gane debate to be þat moyses wold þai war putt to pyne. Bot he sone them re[leu]ed and mend þer myschawnce. þen was god with þem greuede, and sone he sent veniance. 199 Wyld wormes wex þem a mang, full mekyll of fors and fell os fyre, Qwylke sume with toth, and sume with tang, bott and brent þem bone and lyre. To moyses fast þen can þei gang for socur os to þer soueran syre. And all yf þei had wryed hym wrang, his wyll was to do þer desyre. he prayd god þem to amend and for gyf þer trespasse. And þor god hath hym kend to cast a worme of brasse 200 And als a seyn hym forto rayse. and þus þen told he in his tayle: “Als sone os þei yt sees”, he says, “of all hurtes þei sall be hole.” And so was done by dyuerse days, wher so þei went be down or dale. To Arnon fluyd þei toke the ways, þat lyged þen low in a vayle. A Suthervn syre Seon was kyng of Amaryce; Abowt þat flud Arnon was he man mekyll in price. 201 And for moyses hys men wold saue and hald þem sownd by se and sand, he send to Seon leue to craue to lede his folke thrugh owt his land. Bot Seon sayd he suld not haue, bot sone þei suld be bon in band. Seon was strekyn with his awn staue; Moyses dystroyed all þat wold stand. þer wan þei welth gud on, more þen men my?t of tell. In a Cyte cald Esmon, þor drest þei þem to dwell. 202 whyls þei soiornde in þat Cyte, A land was nere þat hey?t basan, And Og was kyng of þat cuntre. of Ebrews herd he tythand þen. he ordand hym þer bayn to be, bot god þat all gud consell can Ordand þat ouercomyn was he, and Ebrews all þat wrschepe wan. þus logyd þei in sere landes and conquerd sere kyngdome And held þem in þer handes, or þei come to the flome. 203 ?ett wonned on, ose þer way lyse, hey?t balake, a kyng full cruell, And he was mayster of moabyse, A folke þat was full fers and fell. how Ebrew ouer all þen wan the price, be dyuerse tythynges herd he tell. And for þei ware of were so wyse, he drede [hym] more with þem to mell. he cald to hys conse[ll] to se what ware to do, To take trewse or batell, and þus þei told hym to, 204 “The Ebrews ar men full my?ty and mony [mo þan] we may bryng. [to fyght] with þem ware grett foly; þer god is with them in all thyng. Bot balam, the prophett, wones herby, þat god wyll graunt all his askyng. Make hym go curse þat cumpany and wary þem both old and yong. þen sall þer god with draw his helpe, wher in þei treyste. So sall þei lyg full low and lyfe euyn as vs lyst.” 205 The kyng in hast, ys no at hyde, hath send his seruant, os þei ordand, And balam wold no langer byd, he com furth as the kyng cum[m]and. his ase stud styll when he suld ryde, And balame bett hym with a wand. The best spake and told in þat tyde how þat he saw an angell stand The way hym for to lett. then was the prophett flayde, hamward his hede he sett, bot sone the angell sayd, 206 “hald furth þi gatt, os þou be gan, vnto the kyng of Amo[r]yse. When þou comys to flom iordan and sees wher the chylder of israel lyys, God bydes the þat þou þem not ban bot blesse þem all on the best[e] wy[s]e. And he sall be with þe þor þen And saue þe from all yll enmyse.” Then past the prophett playn, euyn os the angell hym lede. The kyng was þen full fayn, for he wened well haue spede. 207 All his entent he told hym tyll þat he suld wary the jews all way. he sayd, “ser, haue vs vnto an hyll wher we may se all þer aray.” Then was he fayn [þat] to fulfyll, vnto the heghtest hyll hasted þei. And þer the prophet stod full styll, and þus to þem cane he say, “[?]e chylder of israel, þat myrth full lang hath myst, Tythynges to yow I tell: god byddes that ?e be blest” 208 “with all gudnese, ase he be gane to abraham your fader free, To ysac and to jacob þen, of whos kynradyn all comyn ar ?e. ?e sall conquer all chanan and haue yt in your pawste.” Then was the kyng a carefull man, when þat he herd yt so suld be. ffull sore he was a schamed, for he þat fyght had soy?t, And balaam fast he blamed, for þat he band þem noy?t. 209 he prayd to wary þem on all wyse so þat he my?t þem bett and bynd. Agayns hys boyde he blyst þem thryse, and als he sayd, so suld þei fynd. Then balac, kyng of moabyse, went a way as wroth os wynd. And balam þer mad prophecy[se] þat crist suld come amang þer kynd. he sayd a sterne suld ryse of jacob begynnyng, And a wand of mekyll price of israel owt suld spryng, 210 Qwylke suld conquere kyng and cuntre of moabyse in mony a sted. And suns of seth, also sayd he, suld be hent from handes of dede. The stern to crist may lykynd be to ly?t þem þat lay low os led, The wand, Mary his moyder fre, þat suld com of the jew kynred. Thes wordes was fro god sent. kyng balake cursed þat qwylle, Bot balaam, or euer he went, he wroy?t a weked wyle. 211 he saw the kyng was not well payd, þerfor sum comforth wold he kene. “ser, I sall þe lere,” he sayd, “to stroye moyses and all his men. gayr damsels be gayly gratt to seke in Cytes, neyn or ten, And when þei ar ry?tly arayde, vnto the Ebrews send þem þen. Grett myrth þer sall þei make to ?ong men euyn and morne And gayr þem god forsake. so sall þei sone be lorne.” 212 The kyng hath sent, os he can say, [For] ffayrest wemen þat men fand. [He did theym cloth in rych array and thus to theym he command], “loke wysly þat ?e wend your way to our enmyse of vncowth land, And fowndes to gayr þem leyf þer lay. lett belfagor be þer warrand.” þo wemen werly soy?t þis falshed to fulfyll. The Ebrews groched noy?t forto werke all þer wyll. 213 þei leued the law þat moyses lent and vnto mawmentre mad þer mene. And for þei so to syn assent, god was greued vnto þem ylkon. To moyses told he his entent and bad tyte veniance suld be tone. with wo so XX milia went, and wemen war full wyll of wone. ffynnes, a full fell man, Elea?ar son was hee, Sloght þer maysters þan; the remnand fast can flee. 214 And for þi þat þis ffyneys dystroyed þem þat ware goddes enmyse, fforto be byschop god hym chese aftur his fader for his seruys. And for his sake he grawnt peyse vnto all Ebrews þat ware wyse, And sayd he suld þer kynd encresse vnto grett reuerence forto ryse. with moyses then was none þat he lede ouer the se, Bot þei ware ded ylkon bot Calaphe and josue. 215 þen commawnd god vnto moysen, for he suld fayn his fo[e]s to fere, þat he suld reckyn the remnand þen of all þo þat my?t armys bere. he fand thre hunderth thowssand men þat my?ty were to wend in were withowtyn prestes and clerkes to ken, qwylke XXIII milia ware. god bad moyses be wyse and þat his h[o]st ware grayde To stroye the moabyse, that had þem þor be trayd. 216 Moyses withowtyn more abayd, XII milia toke he þem amang; þer leder fyneys he made þem forto gyd wher þei suld gang. To moabyse full ry?t þei rode and stroyde þem all with strokes strang. ffyue hethyn kynges with cuntreys brayd in few days to ded þei dang. Balam þei haue not leued, þat fyrst conseld the kyng: ffynyes stroke of his hed for his fals consellyng. 217 All batels þus þei broy?t to end; þen past þei home with mekyll pride. No tong in erth my?t tell the tend Of welth þat þei haue in þat tyde. Ry?t to the flome all folke was frend; to do þem dere durst non abyd. Two of þer lyneg þer wold lend, by cawse the land was large and wyd; þat was gad and ruben. the kynrendes toke to rede And asked leue of moysen to dwell styll in þat stede. 218 þus prayde þei throly, all and sume, bot moyses made þis connand þen That þei suld passe ouer the flome And helpe to conquere canan. And when þei gerico had wun into þer boundom, best and man, Vnto þat cuntre suld þei come and be þer styll, os þei be gane. Ten cytes made moyses, in tyme þei soiournd þore, To þem þat cuntre chese to haue and hald euer moyre. 219 Then moyses both with hert and hand loued his god of grett powere, ffor he wyst that he suld from þem wend. he told the folke his consell clere; he sayd, “sers, I sall sun make end, for canan come [I] not nere. kepes commawnmentes, os I haue kend, and oþer law loke ?e non lere. Elya?ar sall byschop be to stand in Aron stede, And ?e sall hald Josue your Duke, when I am dede.” 220 “þat on may mekyll [you] a[v]ayle þat god yow here gyf mynd and my?t; þat oþer sall wend in batell and ffell your foys with fors in fy?t. þerfor in fayth loke ?e not fayle, bot euer in trowth be trew and ry?t. þen nawder enmyse, [ne] yll consell sall do yow dere be day or ny?t. haue mynd hou god hath wrogh for yow and your of spryng. loke ?e for geyt hym noy?t, bot thanke hym ouer all thyng.” 221 “Sone sall ?e passe flom iordan to the land þat yow leuest wore. And when ?e come to canan and hath all þat god hey?t yow þore, loke ?e dystroy all mawmentes þen of fendes þat ?e fynd ?ow be fore, And part the land as ?e well can aftur your lynage, lesse and more. who so hath most mene?e, born all of a blode, þem nedes the most cuntre to fynd ther bestes fode.” 222 As moyses þus his consell kend to can the law and kepe yt well, A whyt clowde down fro heuyn dyscend and couerd hym ouer ylka dele. he was a way when þei lest wend, bot wheder ward wyst þei not well. Ne more þei herd of his end, ne his graue cowd no man fynd ne fele. þei soy?t and sayd alas with mornyng þem amang, Os yt no wonder was, for he had led þem lang. 223 Moyses mad end in þis maner. full mekyll mone was for hym ment. To god his dedes war euer dere, for trew in trowth was his entent. ffull leue he was goddes law to lere, os long os he on lyfe was lent, wherfor we wott withowtyn were his sawle vnto heuyn is hent. This boke þus end wyll we þat made is of moysen, And tell furth of Josue. god grawnt vs myrth. Amen. Josue 224 moyr of the store may men se what was done aftur moyses dede. A nobyll duke, hey?t Josue, was ordand to stand in his sted; Elya?ar, byschope was he the pepyll forto rewle and rede. þen neght þei nere þat [cuntre] god þem hey?t of his godhede, So þat yt my?t be sene, the land of canan; Noy?t bot the flome be twen. and þus þei ordand þan. 225 Be cawse the Cyte of gerico was next the flome and fast þerby, Josue had ordand two most cunnand of þat cumpany Vnto þat Cyte forto go and bad þat þei suld spyre and spye The wardes and the wals also and all þat passage preuely, how þei my?t tytyst take þat Cyty be on asent. This message forto make two wyght men furth þer went. 226 To Jerico þei toke the way, A Cety semly vnto sy?t. þei spyrd full ry?t all þer aray, both ways be neth and wals on hey?t. So dyd þei dewly all þat day to tyme þat neght nere þe ny?t; þer þar loygyng in a place toke þei with A woman þat raab hy?t. Scho had fayr rent in hand, laft of hyr elders be forn; Bot scho was commyn kend as hostler euyn and morn. 227 Whyls þei the Cyte þus aspyd, all yf þei ware wytty and wyse, To the wardyns þei wer ascryde þat Raab herberd swylk to spyse. The bayles went in the euyn tyde to foche þem furth be for þe justyce. Bot preuely scho can þem hyde and hold from handes of þer enmyse. Scho lett þem lang or day ouer the wals of þat Cyte And teched þem the redy way from all enmyse to flee. 228 Bot fyrst scho festend þis connand or euer scho wan þem ouer þe wall: “when ?e sall entur into þis land and gouer[n] þis Cyte, grett and small, Me and myn, loke ?e warrand þat no defawt vnto vs fall.” herto þei both held vp þer hand and sayd, “this cunnand kepe we sall. þou and þi mene?e both sall well be sayued,” þei say. þei went withowtyn wothe ouer the flome the euyn way. 229 Vnto Josue þei reckynd ry?t of Jerico all poyntes playn, And wher þei suld muster þer my?t to wyn yt well with owtyn payn; And how þei [had to] Raab hey? so þat scho suld be saued certayn, By cawse scho sayued þem in the ny?t, when bayles suld þem haue slayn. þei loued god with gud wyll þat þo ?ong men so ?emed, And hetes yt to fulfyll and do euyn os þei demed. 230 Josue bad the pepyll pray and honer god with mayn and mode, And ordan þat on the thryd day suld þei passe furth ouer the flud. The suns of leuy, be for went þai berand the arke of god full gud. Thei fand þer wath and redy way, wher neuer folke be fortym ?ode. Wemen and chylder ?yng then next þem fowled fast. The flud sessyd of fluyng whyls all the pepyll past. 231 When þei war past, both best and man, the stremys wex agayn full strang. þei loyge þem in canan, þat land þat þei had coyuet lang. Elya?ar has ordand þen þat certan men sone suld gang ffor twelf stones to the flome Jordan and make an Auter þem amang. þei purueyd sone a place wher god honerd suld be. Ther held þei fest of pasce with grett solempnite. 232 And [when] the solempne day was done And all the folke refreyshed were, Josue semled hys host full sone of lysty men, both lesse and mayre; Pristes and dekyns gart he gone and beyr goddes arke vp þem be forne. To Jerico þei went ylkon and hastely, when þei come þore, A day Jornay abowt be strengh þei haue dystroyde. þen þei with In had dowtt full sone forto be noyde. 233 Then Josue bad the clargy gang with all the lynage of leuy And beyr the arke vp þem amang abowt the town to ylk party, And at þei suld syng solemp song and make all maner of mynstralsy. And yf the wals war neuer so strang, so suld god send þem þe vyctory. “Bot o thyng I yow of warne: when ?e entur with in, Sparse no manys wyfe ne barne bot Raab and hyr kyn.” 234 “ffor scho our messyngers con sayue when we þem sent ouer the flude.” And also he commawnd knyt and knaue and comyns þat with hym ?ode þat þei suld nawder hyde ne haue to þem selfe syluer ne oþer gud, Bot stryke þem down with sword and staue and stroy all þat be for þem stud. gold to þat tabernakyll he bad þat þei suld beyre, To god þat dyd þat merakyll to þem in all þer were. 235 þat þei suld kepe þis commaw[n]ment he charegd þe ost, both old and ?ong, And sayd forsothe þei suld be schent þat to þem self toke any thyng. Abowt the Cety þen þei went full solemply [and] sanges can syng. And on the seuynt day hath god sent entre [e]wyn at þer awn lykyng Wher the arke of god [can] dwell, the folke abydyn styll. The wals fayled and down fell, and þei enturd at wyll. 236 So when þei had þis Cyte wun, þei slow and brent both best and man. Bo[t] raab, os þei had begun, and hyr kyn þei keped as þei cane. On Achor, þat was caryn son, A full rych mantyll fand he þen; he hyd yt when he had yt fun; þat boldnes aftur my?t he ban. he brake goddes commawnment, þat Josue for bede. þerfor fele folke war schent, and he had dulfull dede. 237 Bot how þat care be gan to com, the story furth reherses ry?t. þor stud a fferrom, ner the flome, A rych Cyte þat Adan hy?t. Josue semled all and sum his kny?tes þat ware wyse and wy?t, And XXX thowssand on a thrum sent he with þo folke to fy?t. Bot þei þat ware with in so boldly batell bede, þe Ebrews, moyre and myn, war sum slayn, and sum fled. 238 when Josue herd þis folke to flayd, no meruell yf he war yll meued. “Sum of our self has synd,” he sayd, “wher for our god is to vs greued.” lottes a mang them sone þei layd so forto se the soth, þei beleued. þei fand how Achor þem be trayd, and how þe mantyll had þem myscheued. To ded sone was he staned, as his werke was worthy. And Josue fast wold fownd forto venge þ[i]s velany. 239 To Adan [he] ys wentt agayn with XXX milia and well moe, And when he come nere on a playn, he parted hys pepell euyn in two: The on half to a mowntan preuely bad he þem go. To tyme þe saw his syng certan, the Cety suld þei entur so. þei past furth preuely In buschement so forto be. he and hys company A sawted þat Cety. 240 with In thei ware full sterne and stowte, for þem had falyn so fayr be for. Thei opynd the ?attes and wentt owt, all men of Armes, lesse and more. Then Josue feyned to fle for dowt to þei fare fro the Cyte wore; Then to the mowntane he made a schowt and set his syng to þem þore. To the Cety þen þei wentt and fand full euyn entre. ffull fast þei schott and brentt þat folke my?t farre see. 241 when Josue agayn [can] loke vnto the Cyte styfe of stone, he saw þor fyre and full grett smoke and sparkes fleand full gud [w]one. To his men þen he vndertoke þat þat Cyte to þem was tone. he bad þem wett wele ylka noke þat þer enmys scaped none. All that be hynd oght dwelt belyue ware dongyn down, þat wentt be fore ware feld with þem þat toke the town. 242 Ther ware the panyms put to payn; þei had no bodes þem to beld. And the Ebrews ware farly fayn to se þer Enmys feld in feld. Thrugh owt the Cyte past þei playn and spared none in yowth ne eld. þei gatt þer gold þat my?t þem gayn and oþer welth at wyll to weld. So went þei, old and ?ong, to þer awn cumpany And mad full grett offeryng to god, os was worthy. 243 When þei had wonn þis grett renown, grett word of þem be gan to ryse, how Jacob suns wold dyng al down and in were how þei wan þe prise. So was A cuntre hey?t gabown, and the pepyll hey? gabonyse. þei sembled in þat same seson and toke þer cownsell on þis wyse: To putt þem furth in presse þer land forto dyffend, Or elles persew for peyse, and þus þer consell kend. 244 þei toke twelfe of þat same Cete, qwylke þat þei for most cunnand knew, And sent þem vnto Josue for sympyll peyse forto persew. þei sayd, “we cum fro far cuntre with ye, ser, forto take peyse and trew; B[y] our cloghys þat may þou se; when we went furth, þen ware þei new. Or we wyn hom agayn, wyl be full mony a day.” þei toke trewse by þis trayn, and fast þei went þer way. 245 when Josue þus þer peyse had sworn, he trowed þem folke of full far land. Bot hym was told sone on the morn þat þei ware neghbours nere at hand Of canan—þis toy?t hym scorne— Not III days jornay þens dwelland. Bot for sewrty was fest be forn, he sayd þe peyse suld stably stand, So þat þei suld not fall, þat land whyls þei wonned in, To bere wode and fuell þer sacurfyce to be gyne. 246 kyng of ierusalem herd tell of bayle þat in þat land be gan, how þat the chylder of israel ware comyn fare ouer flom iordan, And how þei hade wun þem o mell fyrst Jerico and sythyn Adan And gabonyse with þem to dwell. þat mad hym a full mornand man. hee sayd hys men to ryse and prestly to persew To stroy the gabonyse, for þei had takyn trew. 247 ffor IIII kynges sone had he send, qwylk well he wyst [wold] with hym [l]ast. To gabonyse wyghtly þei wend þem and þer Cytes down to cast. Bot Josue wold þem dyffend, ffor þei in fayth war festynd fast. with his mene?e þem to amend to paynyms planly ys he past. he tokyd [þem] in þat tyme so þat þer fled bot fone, ffro on howr aftur prime to fowr howrs aftur none. 248 hym toy?t the day went hastely; þerfor he prayd god for his grace, And god of hys gud curtasay lenghed þat day II days space: he made the sone to stand for þi and passe not furth his kyndly pase, Tyll Iosue had the vyctory and ouercomyng of all hys foyse. Sqwylke grace os god dyd þore Agayns the cowrse of kynd was neuer seyne be fore, als fere os men may mynd. 249 The paynyms os in parke war pynd, to byd þem batell was not to abyd. The fyue kynges held þem be hynd, and [in] a hole þei haue þem hyde. Bot Josue furth can þe[m] fynd. þat he was kyng þore well he kyd. þar handes to þer bakkes gart he bynd, and on this wyse with þem he dyd: he gart þem lyg on lang apon the grownd þor grayd And Ebrews on þem gang, and þus to þem he sayd, 250 “Als ?e fare with kynges fyue þat sulse þem heyr vnder your fette, So sall ?e be lordes in your lyue of paynyms kynges, her I yow hett, And haue maystry of man and wyfe þat wyll no to yow make þem mett. þer sall none stand with yow to stryfe, whyls ?e [your god with gud wyll] grett.” þen gart he hang þos kynges, als oþer had bene be fore, And sythyn of oþer thynges sone made he maystur more. 251 Sex Cytes wan þei þat same day and on the morn als oþer mo. To galgala þen toke þei way vnto þer frendes þat þei wentt fro. Of all þis fayre full fayn ware þei and thanked god wher so þei go. þen made þei m[y]rth and mekyll play; þei wyst of non to werke þem wo. Bot sone aftur þei war noyd of new maner: Kyng Jabyn of Dasore geydderd full grett power 252 Of kynges and dukes and mony a kny?t, þat wysly cowd the wepyns weld; Thre hunderth chareottes hath he dy?t of vetell and tentes with to teld, ffowr hunderth thowssand folke to fy?t ffull well at hors with spere and scheld. To see þat was a semly sy?t when þat þei fared furth on the feld. When Ebrews con þem se, þei ware adred sum dele, Bot god sayd vnto Josue he suld ouercom þem well. 253 Duke Josue and fynyes wold take no tyme to tary lang; þei putt þem furth full fast in presse agayns þer enmys forto gang. þer was no poynttyng vnto peyse bot ylk man his fere to fang. The Ebrews con euer incresse, bot p[a]ynyms toy?t the stoure full strang: þei had no strengh to stand a gayns goddes folke to stryfe. Of IIII hunderth thowssand þer leued bot few on lyfe. 254 þer chareys was fest on fyr ylkon with vessell and with mony a tent. þei spoled and spylt and spared non, tyll all was wast and schamly schent. Bot tresour to þem haue þei tone; Cytes and burghes haue þei brent. When þei had wonn so welth gud wone, to galgala a gayn þei went. þen was none leued in land, kyng ne prince with pryde, þat þem durst more gayn stand, ne in batell þem abyd. 255 Ne forto fle war leued bot fone; þei conquerd all þos cuntreys clene. Thyrty kynges to ded was done with owtyn Dukes and knyghtes kene. Bott all þis werke was not wroght sone; þei toke full mony tym be twene. Then forto noye þem fand þei none, bot all on myrth þei wold mene. þei made grett sacurfyce vnto god allmighty wyt wrschepe on this wyse, als yt was well worthy. 256 Duke Josue þen folke [a]rayse on sylo, þat was A solempne sy?t. And all þus to þem he says, “heuys vp your hertes to god on myght And wrschep hym with wyll all ways þat now hath fulfylled þat he hey?t In abraham and in ysac days, þat þei suld haue þis remes be ry?t To þem and þer of spryng and weld yt with honowrs; ffor now is all þat hetyng fulfylled in vs and ours.” 257 “The grownd þer of in þem be gane and past furth to þer progenyte. yow menys how moyses commawnd þen to vs and to all our cumpany, 'qwen ?e haue conqwerde Canan and hath yt at your awn maystry, Depart yt als wele os ?e cane to the twelf kynradyns communly'. þus was his bydyng last, and so part yt we sall. Sythyn sall we lottes cast qwylke part to qwylke sall fall.” 258 Ten of the wysest furth can fayre and [m]ett the land in lengh and bred. when þei had done þat charge and charre, agayn then hastely can þei sped. Then Josue, and Ele?aar to ylke a kynradyn toke gud hede And gafe ylkon aftur þei wayre mony or few þer on to fede. So wentt þei all and sum aftur þer cowrse was cast. And þei be ?ond the flome vnto þer partes past. 259 Qwen XX ?eres war full spend fro tyme þei past flome iordayn, þen Josue full clere kend þat he most passe by kynd of man. Aftur the Ebrews hath he sent, and to þem þus sayd he þan, “Syrs, I may no langer lend to gouerne yow, ose I be gan. My tyme neghys nere þat me behouys fownd yow fro. My consell sall ?e heyre and takes gud tent þer to.” 260 “honowrs god euer, old and ?yng, and kyndly kepes hys commawndment. And coueyttes now non oþer kyng, bot trows in hym with trew entent. whyls ?e do so, all erthly thyng þat nedfull is [is] to yow sent. And what tyme ?e breke þis bydyng, full sodanly ?e sall be schent. hath mynd, both more and lesse, what dedes he for yow dyde And of seyre grett kyndnese he to your kyndradyn kyde.” 261 “he lede þem fayr fro fayran and mad þer way thrugh waters clere and drowned þer enmys ylkon þat none with noye my?t negheþem nere, And sythyn in wyldernes [gud wone] sent þem [of] foyde full XL ?ere.

And whyls ?e vse all honest thews, full sauely sa[ll] your sede be sawn.” þus lerned he lest and most to eschew all yll thyng. And then he gafe his gost to goddes awn goueryng. 263 þus qwen þis nobyll Duke was Ded, the folke made doyle withowtyn drede. And whyls þei wroy?t aftur his rede, þei had lordschep of ylke led. Ele?aar, ther sufferan hed, the same way sone aftur ?ode. And hys sun fynyes in his sted was ordand furth þos folke to led. This boke ys of Josue sen tyme þei past the flome, And oþer new say sall we, þat is called Iudicum. Judicum 264 when Josue, þat gentyll kny?t, was hent to heuyn, ose men may here, The Ebrews, men of grett my?t, þen leued in myrth full mony A ?ere. And forto wyn þat was þer ry?t sadly þei soy?t on sydes sere, And fynys for þem to fy?t ferd with the folke both farre and nere. þe Cyte of salem in þe sort of byniamyn, Sythen cald ierusalem, þat went þei forto wyn. 265 The Cyte was both lang and wyde, warded and walled full well for were. þei segede yt on ylka syde with men of ermys and oþer geyre. The cananews war bold to byde, þei dowtede non to do þem dere. Bot at the last layd was þer pride; þei fand full fe[w] folke þem to fere. had þei lufed god lely, no man my?t þem haue noyde; þei lyued in mawmentry, þat dyde þem be dystroyde. 266 The Ebrews enturd as þei toy?t, and all þer enmys fast þei feld. þei spoled and spylt and spared noy?t bo[t] tresour þat þei toke vnt[eld]. And when þei hade þer werkes wroy?t, at home no langer þei þem held, Bot in Ebron fast haue soy?t vnto Mowntans wher gyantes dweld. When fynyes þem fand, he stroyde þem in a thrawe And delyuerd all þer land to clerkes þat keped þe law. 267 þei conqwerd marches, lesse and more, and welth enogh so can þei wyne. Bot Salem, os I sayd be fore, fell in þe sort of Byngemyn, And þerfor þus was ordand þore þat þei and þers suld dwell þer in. þat Cyte sone can þei restore in grett comforth to all þer kyn. þei partyde þem amang thresour by chaunse to chesse, And so all can þei gang vnto þer awn Cetyse. 268 þus ware þe Ebrews ylkon logyde in þe land of canan. þei had no lord bot [god] all on forto do sewtt ne seruyce þan. Ne forto noye þem fand þei none, the commawnmentes kepe why[l]s þei cane. Bot hastely þei hath mysgone, And byniamyns folke fyrst be gane. Both moyses and Iosue bad þat þei suld þem kepe ffro folke of þat cuntre and paynems feleschepe. 269 The lordes of byniamyn lynage to breke þis bedyng hath be gune; when þei sufferd for certan stage, the hethyn men a mang þem wun. And towns lett þei for tripage, wher in philystyyns was fun. And paynyms, both man and page, to be þer seruandes hath þei bun. And euyn os þei began, all oþer soyne assent þat vnethes on man toke [kepe to] þe commawndment. 270 In hertes þei war so sterne and stowt for weltes of gud and grett maystri. The law þem lyst not leue ne lawt bot lyued in lust and lechery. By cawse þei had no werre withowt, amang þem wex full grett enuy. And the byniamyns was most abowt to groche and greue god allmighty. þat was schewed in schort tyd at the Cyte of gabaon, next salen nere be syde, how fowle þer þei fon. 271 þer yt be fell apon a day prowd beniamyns with þer mene?e wentt in a place þem forto play be for the ?attes of þat Cete. An Ebrew com þer in the way with his wyfe, full fayre and fre. Amang þem self þen can þei say, “yond woman þis ny?t weld wyll we”. þer curstnes so þe kyd, qwat for scath and qwatt for scorne. ffor dedes þei to hyr dyde, scho was fun dede at morn. 272 hyr husband þen had mekyll care; No wonder was þof he were wo. The body he toke and with hym bare to his cuntre, wher he com froo. he sent to Cetys lesse and more to gabaon be lyfe at goo þor forto venge þat fellows fare, and hastely þei hafe done so. Bott þei þat wroght þis woghe with in ware sterne and stowt; Ten thowsand sone þe sloghe of þem þat ware with owt. 273 Then ware þe Ebrews put to payn, ffor þat asawt full sore þem rews. ffor fynyes þen was not fayn of the feyghyng, for all ware jews. his host he sembled sone agayn, and to þe rebels he remews. XX milia sone ware slayn, for with þem wold he take no trews. Both wyf, chyld and page þei byrttynd sone and brent. So was all þat lynage for þer sy[n] schamly schent. 274 By cawse þei toke þe trew manys wyfe, þat progenyte was put to p[y]n Bot sex hunderth þat fled on lyue. þer lyued no mo of all þat lyne, Qwylke aftur, qwen þei toy?t to th[ryue], with oþer Ebrews acordy[d] syne. And stylly so with owtyn stryfe þei saued þe sort of beniamyne. All þer possessions playn to þem þei con restore And so ordand agayn XII, os þei ware be fore. 275 In gabaon þei con þem sese with oþer cytes large and lang. þen leued þe Ebrews all at ese; wold non with greue agayn þem gange. Als lang os þei wold god plese, was non in ward to wyrke þem wrang. And when þei melled oþer ways, sone mengyd myschef þem amang. [When they left moyses law and to mavmentres theym mende], So Cananews couth knaw þat god was not þer frend. 276 Then fynyes dede aftur tytt þat þem to maynte[n] euer h[ym] melled. þei folowd all þer flesch delytt, and god his helpyng from þem held. þen Cananews with owt respett dang þem down qwer so þei dweld: þus scaped þei not vndyscumfeytt; fylysteyns in feldes þei felled. þus aboyde þei sorows sere, and no wrschepe þei wan. þis lastyd XX ?ere, and þus fell aftur þen. 277 A semly man, þat Cenys hy?t, of Iudas generacion, he proferd hym for þem to fy?t and vnto batell mad hym bown. Phylysteyns he putt to þe fly?t and feld þer foys in feld and town. Sythyn XL ?ere he rewled þem ry?t and dyed sone aftur þat seson. þen sone the folke can fon and wroy?t as wryches vnwyse. So come to þe kyng Eglon with full mony moabyse. 278 he conquerde cuntres to and fro and greued þem with full grett owtrag: Sum to byrn and sum to slo and sum þei sett in sere seruage. he toke þe Cyte of Ierico and putt the pepyll to pay trypage. hyt was his ded, for he dyed so; his lordschep last bot a lytill stage. An Ebrew, þat hy?t howade, þat well cowd plese and playn, Made kyng Eglon oft glade with fals talyes þat he cowd feyne. 279 ffell on a day þe kyng and he ware in a chamber þem alone. he slogh þe kyng in preuyte and laft hym ded styll ose a stone. And he wentt in the same Cete and warned þe Ebrews ylkon And bade þei suld son arayd be; þer enmys suld als tytt be tone. When moabyse wyst þer kyng was so dede, sone þei remeued And fled both old and ?yng, and Ebrews fast persewed. 280 In þat persewyng hade þei payn: þer wold no cety þem socour. X milia of þem was slayn, so ware þei stound in þat stoure. The Ebrews can [þen ordand] howade to be þer gouernowre. To XVIII ?eres was past playn, full s[u]rely saued he þer honour. Then re[gn]ed Senagar, þat VI C ons sloght Of panyms, þat prowd ware, with a soke of a ploght. 281 Sythyn Ebrews assent to syn and cowd not kepe þer laws clene, þen com on þem kyng Iabyn with cananews þat ware full kene. he wold no sesse to slo and byrn, bot sone aftur hade he tene. Two Ebrews, comyn of gentyll kyn, In batell to hym þem betwene. Barrett and Debora þus ware þei named þore, And well gouerand þei two full XL ?ere and more. 282 When XL ?eres was fully past, for þei to god ware euer grochand, In grett dyscumforth war þei cast for hungar þat fell in þat land. And VII wynters, so lang yt last, to sympyll folke no fode þei fand. þen vnto god þei cryed full fast and prayd his help with hert and hand. ffor als þei fayled mett, ?ett had þei mo enmys þat dyde þem greuance grett, madyans and malachys. 283 when þei to god þer kayrs knew how þ[ei] a gayns hy[s] wyll were went, On gedion, a gentyll Jew, of þer awn lynage, hath he lent. And for he in his trowth was trew, god hath his angell to hym sent, like vnto A man in hyd and hew, and told hym how his maker ment fforto aray hym ry?t, both hert, hed and hend, And þen wend furth to fy?t, goddes folke forto dyffend. 284 Gedeon was þat same morne purueyd in a preue stede To clepe his schepe and thresch his corne so forto ordand cloghes and brede. The angell þat com hym be forne and broy?t bodword os god hym bede, he wened full well yt had ben scorne. þerfor he was full wyll of rede And toy?t he suld asay by some experiment Whedder yt ware trew or nay þat god his seruant had hym sent. 285 A flesse he sprede be for his fette on þe erthe and all ny?t lett yt ly. he sayd, “yf þis flese be wett to morn at morn and þe moldes dry, þen wyll I trow and hertly hette þis message is of god allmighty.” On the morn full drye was all the strett, and þe flese wett, þat was ferly. þen þe contrary he ordand at euyn latte: At þe morne the flese was dry and all the ways full waytte. 286 Gedion þen trowed with trew entent þat þies tokyns was trew and ry?t. he told þe folke goddes commawndment how he suld þem dyffend in fy?t. he samed sone by on assent IX milia to beyre armys bry?t. And god hym wysched, or euer he went, forto a say þem in his sy?t. he sayd, “wende to the flome with all þi folke in fere And make þem all and sum to drynke of þat water clere.” 287 “All þoo þat on þer fette vp standes and fenys not for scheld ne spere Bot takes þe watur vp with þer handes to drynke, þo sall do enmys dere. And þo þat lyges low on the sandes to drynke os a mule or a mere ledde þem no ferther to oþer landes; þei ar not worth to wend in were.” When þei com to þe flude, ylkon heldyd down his hede. Of þo þat euyn vp stude ware bot thre hunderth leued. 288 When gedion saw þat y[t] was so, his hert be gan to houer and hone: he wyst pa[n]yms wer mony moe, for of his folke wer left bot fone. Bot god bad he suld boldly go and mell with þem both morn and none. “ffor sone”, he sayd, “þou sall þem slo”, and als he demed, so was yt done. Oreb and ?ebe þei two þe hethyn folke con lede, ?ebee and salmana, þo IIII dyed at þat dede. 289 All ware þei dede and dyscumfeyt, þe hethyn [folke] fully in fere. Bot all þis was not done so tytt; þat batell was full strang to stere. Gedion to rewle þem had respeyt in rest and pese full XL ?ere. he leued lyfand with owtyn lyte sexty fayr suns of wemen sere. The eldyst, abymalech, putt his brethyr to pyn; he wrogh a wofull cheke, þat slogh fyfty and neyne. 290 When he had so his brethyr sloyn, of sychym was he soueran syre. Bot god hath vengiance on hym tane þat sone he past fro þat empyre: hys armys was strekyn of with a stone; he serued to haue no bettur hyre. Then ware þe Ebrews left alon; ylkon my?t do þer awn desyre. Of god þei had non aw for gold and grett maystry. þerfor þei left his law and lyued in mawmentry. 291 þei mad þem goddes of gold and brasse and sayd þo same þer seyle had sent. þen god full gretly greued was þat þei so wrang a gayns hym went. Enmys he putt on þem to passe þat þem slow and þer cetes brynt To tym þei kneled and cryd alas and turned to god with gud entent. When þei þer trespasse knew, god send þem sone socour, On [G]epte, a gentyll Jew, to be þer gouernowre. 292 [G]epte was a knyght in armys clere; fro bayle, he sayd, he suld þem bryng. A fayre lady he hade to fere, and both þei lyuyd to goddes louyng. he had a doy?tur þat was hym dere and no mo chyldder, old ne ?yng. To hyr be fell, os men may heyre, full gret myschefe, A meruel thyng. he send to Cetys and town, [to] all þat [my?t] armys beyre And bad þei suld be bown to wend with hym in were. 293 þen vnto god hert[l]y he hett and mad a vowe with all his mayne: þat yf he my?t the maystry geytt, als sone os he com home agayn, The fyrst qwyke catell þat he mett of his for goddes sake suld be slayn, In sacrafyce so forto sett. þus sayd he suld be done certayn. To batell þen þei went with owtyn more respyte. þer enmys sone was schent, both slayn and dyscumfeytt. 294 þen past þei home with mekyll pride be cawse þei wan the vyctory. his doy?ghtur herd, is not to hyde, hyr fader suld come [home] in hy. Be lyfe scho went, and wold not [b]yd, agayns hym with gud mynstralsy. When he hyr [saw], “alas”, he cryed, “my doy?ghtur dere, now sall þou dy!” To his hors fette he fell; in sadyll he my?t [not] sytte. No tong in erth may tell what kare his hert had hytt. 295 So when he my?t hym selfe stere, he toy?t in hert how he had hey?t: To slo þe fyrst þat suld apeyre and sacrafyce yt in goddes sy?t. “Alas”, he sayd, “my doy?ghtur dere, for my doyng þi dede is dy?t.” Scho prayd hyr fader to mend his chere and mad hym myrth all þat scho my?t. þe more þat scho mad glee to comforth hym with all, þe more sore hert had he, for he wyst how yt suld fall. 296 “A, doy?tur”, he sayd, “I made a vowe to god when I to batell wentt: yf I of panyms my?t haue prow, what so com fyrst in my present, þat suld be slone; þat same ys þou. alas for my sake now bees þou schent.” “ffader”, scho sayd, “I beseke yow be trew and tornes not your entent. ffor bettur is þat I dye, þat may no thyng a vayle, þen so fayr cumpany os ?e broy?t from batelle.” 297 “Sen ?e hey?t sacrafyce to make to god þat gouerans gud and yll, leues it not, [fader], for my sake bot all your forward fast fulfyll. Bot graunteys me grace two wekes to wake, to speke with lades lowd and styll And of maydyns leue to take, and þen do with me what ?e wyll.” he gafe hyre leue to gang with grefe and gretyng sore. All þat scho come amang ay menyd hyr more and more. 298 So went scho furth to mony a frend, þat for hyre Syghyng sayd alas. All weped for wo os scho can wend when þei wyst how þat it was. And when þe tyme drogh nere þe end þat hyr [fader] assygned has, Scho went agayn with wordes hend and proferd hyr with payn to pas. þerfor hyr fader noy?t leued; his sword in hand he hent And swythly swopped of hyr hede and bad scho suld be brent. 299 grett sorow yt was þis sy?t to se; all weped þat wyst of hyr wo. Bot most sorow in hert had he þat heddyd hyr and had no mo. Swylke folys suld men [be] fayn to flee and be abayst or þei vow so. ff[o]yle [v]ow is bettur to broken be þen man or woman sak[l]es slo. Sex ?ere gouernd Gepte Ebrews and saued þem from all angers yll of phylysteyns and cananews, and þen he dyed os was goddes wyll. 300 Next aftur gepte regned abessan, os clerkes knawn þat con þeron. grett wrschep in his tym he wan, and aftur hym regned Achyron. Ten ?ere and XX aftur þan gufernd a gud man, hy?t Abdon. And sythyn þei hade no mayster man, þat mad þem fowly to fone: þei forsoke goddes seruyce and to Mawmentes þam ment. þerfor with sere enmys sone ware þei schamed and schent. 301 To god þei fast con call and crye and dyd grett penance for þer plyght. And he ordand þen helpe [in] hye. An nobyll man, þat Many hy?t, was haldyn chefe of chewalry and had to wyfe a worth[y] wy?t. Bot chylder bare scho non hym by; þerfor scho drowped day and ny?t. Grett mornyng made þat myld and prayd in town and feld þat god suld send sum chyld þat my?t þer welthes weld. 302 So ose scho prayd with hert and hend, hyr selfe alone in her selere, An Angell saw scho by hyr lend in forme of man with face full clere. “woman”, he sayd, “þi mornyng mend; god takes entent to þi prayer. A sone he sall to þe send, þat sall gouerne þo folke in fere. Of my?t sall none be more on mold amang man kynd. I warne þe þus be fore, as þou sall forther fynd.” 303 “The Ebrews þat in bayle ar brast sall he dyffend with forse in fy?t. Cutt not hys hare [of] for no hast, for þer in sall be most his my?t. Ne lycour loke he non tast to make hym dronkyn day or ny?t, ffor þer with may his wyttes be wast to werke wrang, all yf he be wy?t.” When he had told þis tale, no ferther of hym scho fand. Scho toy?t hyr hert was hale for ioy of þis tythand. 304 vnto hyr lord sone can scho tell of all this case, os scho can kayre: how scho was werned with goddes angell to beyr a chyld to be þer ayre, And how he suld be ferse and fell and his forse in his fax suld fayre. The gud man sayd, “no more þou mell; of swylke dedes I am in dyspayre.” he trowde yt bot a trayn, and to hym self he sayd, “Sum foyle to make hyr fayn hath broy?t hyr in þis brayde.” 305 þan all þof scho be fore was glade throgh bodword of þe angell bry?t, Sone was scho sore and sume dele rade by cause hyr lord sett yt so ly?t. Scho prayd to god with semland sade to send sume tokyn to his sy?t So þat he my?t haue, als scho hade, gud hertyng from heuyn on hy?t. hym selfe made sacrafyce and prayd god of his grace fforto wytt on what wyse þis process com in place. 306 Sone aftur þis þen fell yt so, as þei prayd both with stabyll steuyn, God send his angell to þem two, and þat same note he can þem neuyn. Manne þen toke tent þerto and loued þe lord of ly?t and leuyn. ffor when þe angell ferd þem fro, þei saw how he was hent to heuyn. The wyfe sone wex with chyld and bare with owtyn blame A barne to be þer byld. Sampson þei cald his name. 307 Phylysteyns had þen maystry, And Ebrews was with owtyn beld. This chyld was tent full tenderly; all wold his hele þat hym be held. To batell bede he his body, as sone ose hee my?t wepyns weld. On mold was no man so my?ty. þe phylystyens his felnes feld Ay whyls he leued goddes law and keped his commawndment. All men of hym had aw in werld, wher euer he wentt. 308 his moder herd þe angell say how þat hys hore suld not be schorne. þerfor scho dyde yt wex all way; so wex his my?t mydday and morne. Phylesteyns oft can he flay þat was full fers and fell be forne, Tyll ay at the last he lufed þer lay and went with þem þat wold hym scorne To þer Cyte þat hey?t tanna with thourys clene. þor saw he sone a sy?t, þat sythyn turned hym to tene. 309 Euyn os he enturd þat Cete, a semly madyn sone he mett, Of fygur fayre and face full free; with full grett gladschepe scho hym grett. hym toy?t her semly on to se; hys hert at all on hyr was sett, And to hyr kynradyn carped he þat hyr to wed wold he not lett. þen was the phylesteyns fayn to gare hym luf [þer lay], ffor þei trowde by sum trayn sum tyme hym to be tray. 310 he playd hym þor lang os hym lyst with mekyll myrth be twen þem twa. his kynrede of þis werke noy?t wyst, for þat Cety was farre þem fro. his moyder morned, fro scho hym myst. þen toke he his leue in Tanna And turned agayn vnto his trest, his frendes þat soiornde in Sarra. he told þem tales to þe end of his dedes day and ny?t And of þat maydyn hende, how [he] hys hert hade hey?t. 311 his moyder mornyd and mony moe qwen þei herd tell of þis tythyng. Bot no of þem durst say hym so to wreth hym, all yf he was [k]yng. his fader sayd be twen þem two, “sun, yt is no semly thyng with philysteyns vs forto go; þei hatte vs Ebrews, old and ?ynge. And moyses in his law amonyst, als vs menys, þat we suld euer vs withdraw fro fals phylysteyns.” 312 “vs ow to lufe god allmighty, as our forme faders dyd be forne. Phylesteyns makes þem mawmentry and honers þem both euyn and morn. þerfor, dere sone, sett not þerby. we haue þe sayued sen þou was borne; Sayue now þi selfe fro socerry, els may þou ly?tly be for lorne.” his moyder weped all way and sayd he suld be schent. Bot all þat þei cowde say my?t not turne his entent. 313 And when þei saw yt my?t [not] spede more forto lerne hym lowd ne styll, Sum dele for luf, sum dele for drede, þei grawntt hym to haue his wyll. Sone afturward all same þei ?ode þis foly forward to fulfyll, And with fayr wordes þo folke to fede, throw spech yf þei my?t yt spyll. So soy?t þei fro Sarra by wuddes and wastes wyld And toke þe way to Tanna with Sampson, þer semly chyld. 314 þen of sum torfurs men may tell, qwylke in þat tyme to hym be tyde. ffor os þei wentt, swylke ferles fell, his herdenes may not be hyde. Be hynd his frendes os he con dwell, vnder a wud syde what so he dyde, A lyon come hym fort[o] qwell, for he saw none with hym abyde. And the lyon þer he slogh euyn his twa handes be twen And tyll a dyke hym drogh, for he suld not be sene. 315 when he had doyn þis doyghty dede, þat non wyst of bot only hee, Aftur his frendes full fast he ?ede, os þei raked to þat rych Cete. þor fand þei folke full fayre to fede, of phylysteyns full grett plente. Bot þat þei hethyn lyue can lede, more plesand pepyll my?t non be. To Manne and his fere full grett myrth can þei make And gaf þem drewres dere for Sampson þer sun sake. 316 To loke his lufe he wold nott lett for no thyng þat my?t be tyde. Be for hyr frendes furth was scho sett with mynstralcy and mekyll pryde. Qwen Manne and þat mene?e mett and cause of þer comyng dyscryde, A certan seson sone was sett and sewrty layd for ayder syde þat Sampson suld hyre wede be swylke a certayn day. his frendes was sore adrede, bot þei durst not say nay. 317 When all was sett so in certayn, þei soiournd þor bot schort seson. ffull fast þei hyed þem home agayn to sarra, a Cety of renown. Sampson was of þis fayre full fayn; to batell fast he made hym bown. he kyd þat he was mekyll of mayn; phylesteyns oft fast dang he down. þai þat ware all abufe and leued ay so to last, he putt þem to reproue in all place wher he past. 318 All Ebrews folke he can dyffend and made fre þat be fore was thrall. And when þe tym come nere þe ende þat was ordand amang þem all, hys kynradyn holl þat he kend bade he to be at his brydall. And os þei ydderward can wend, A farly fare ?ett can fall: þat place persayued he wher he þe lyon slogh, And the bayns forto se to the dyke he hym drogh. 319 Euyn to þat corse hys cowrse he kest, and sone he fand the bones dry. Bees in þe mowth had mad þer nest; a hony came he fand in hy. he brake yt owt, so toy?t hym best, and menyd to make some bourd þer by. Then raked he furth withowtyn rest tyll he come to his cumpany. with the fayrest hony he fede his fader and moyder also, And sythyn he brake and beyd to oþer frendes moo. 320 And sum dele held he styll in store forto part with his paramowre, ffor of all wemen þat þen [wore] of fayrnes my?t scho beyre þe floure. And hastely when þei come þore, þei ware resayued with grett honowur. And [to] fulfyll forward be fore, assygned þei certan day and howre. Sampson wede þat free with both þer frendes assent with all solempnite and myrth þat my?t be ment. 321 þor was solace of seruyce sere; þei had sene non swylke bot þe same. Both beyrys and bullys and baran dere, þer wanted none, wyld ne tame. Of turnamentes þer men my?t lere; who wold not hurle, hald hym at hame. Bot to Sampson durst non apeyre: All dowt his hand þat herd his name. Be cawse he was so strang, the phylysteyns for þi Ordand þem amang of trefty men thrytty, 322 Qwylke þei well wyst was wyse and wy?t and stalworthest in stede and stall, fforto be nere hym day and ny?t for ferd of fare þat my?t be fall. And when Sampson persayued þat sy?t and all þer gawdes, grett and small, A reson he deuysyd and dy?t forto asay þer wyttes with all. Of the lyon þat he slogh and of þe came with hony he made game gud enoght forto abavst þem by. 323 “sers”, he sayd, “I sall yow tell a taylle þat sall our bowrdyng be, And yf ?e thrytty yow amell what [it] suld sygnyfye can see, Thrytty cloghes of sylke to sell sall I gyfe ?ow in gud degre, And yf ?e fayle how yt be fell, so mony sall ?e gyf to me. Avyse yow in your mode; the question þis es: Owt of the herd come fode, and of the swalowand swettenes.” 324 To þem þis reson he arayd and bad þei suld þat case dyscrye. Of þe purpas þei ware not payd, bot his wyll durst þei not denye. Of VII days respeyt þei hym prayd, to be a vysed þerfor fully. “I grawntt your askyng, sers,” he sayd, and with þo wordes þei went [in hy]. þei dyde þer besenes þis ylke lesson to lere. Bot what þe menyng was cowd þei not all cum nere. 325 when þei had soy?t IIII days or V by consell or þer clergy cle[n]e And oft reherssed þis lesson ryue, þei cowde not say what yt suld mene. þen ware þei stede to strutt and stryue. so sayd on þat had mekyll sene, “we wytt yt neuer bot yf his wyfe may geytt yt told þem two be twen. Sen scho ys of our kyn, assay hyr sone we sall. So may we wrschep wyn.” to þis assentt þei all. 326 Two wysest of þem to hyre wentt and sayd, “syster, þi folke to sayue wytt of þi maystur what it ment, þe mater þat he wold vs craue. ffor and þou tell vs his entent, grett helpyng of vs sall þou haue. And yf þou suffer vs to be schent, þe ware os gud be grathed in graue. Sore vengance sall we take on þe and all þin.” Scho sayd, “sers, for yowr sake I sall assay hym syne.” 327 Sone afturward, when scho my?t wyn alon with hyr lorde to dele, Scho kyssed hym kyndly cheke and chyn and lett ose hyr luf was full lele. “A ser”, scho sayd, “?e sall haue syne, your hert fro me yf ?e oght hele. I wyll forsake both kyth and kyn and wend with yow in wo and wele; My hert ware comforth clene, wole ?e kyndly me kene What þat mater may meyne ?e told to the thryty mene.” 328 “gud leue,” he sayd, “lett be þi fayre to tyme þat þei haue done þer dede. þat mater wyll I not declare forto be neuynd for nokyns nede.” þen sone scho sobed and syghyd sare and feyned hyr febyll by falshede. Scho rent hyr cloghes and ruged hyr hare, os scho wold dye with owtyn drede. When Sampson con hyre see so mowrne and make swylke chere, he sayd, “lemman, lett be; þe lesson sall þou lere.” 329 he lered hyr fyrst of þis lyon, how þat he slogh hym with his hand, And aftur when þat þei come to town by the same way os he can wend, how he in a dyke þer down fand the bones clene þat he kend, And how bees þen had made þem bown in the lyon mowth to loge and lend. “The mowth”, he sayd, “þat ette, and the bownes war hard and drye, And the hony was swett; this case þei suld dyscrye.” 330 “Bot wyfe”, he sayd, “þis þat is wroy?t lett no man wytt be way ne strette.” “A ser”, scho sayd, “þat wold [I not], for all þis werld heyre I yow hette.” Bot in all hast þat euer scho my?t scho made hyre with þo men to mette. A blyth bodword to þem scho broy?t of all þis fare [fro] hed to fette. Scho sayd, “þis [is] certayn and soth, so sall ?e say.” þen ware þei ferly fayn and bold to byde þat day. 331 Be þis was VI days comyn and gone, þe seuynt day was þer seson sett. To Sampson wentt þei ylkon and sayd, “we come to do our dett. what ys more hard þen is the bone amang all fude þat furth is fett, And swettur thyng þen hony is none in mowth, when yt is melled and mett.” when Sampson herd þem say so euyn vnto his merke, he wyst full well allway his wyfe had wroy?t þat werke. 332 And þen persaued he properly qwy scho so stretly can hym enquere The question forto com by, hyr lynage for scho wold yt lere. þen carped he to þat cumpany and told be fore þo folke in fere, “I knaw all your confyderacy, And I answer in þis manere: what may bettur begyle A lele man, lowd or styll, þen weked woman wyle, wher yt is turned vnto yll.” 333 he wyst well how thrytty wore ordand for ?ape men hym to ?eme. ffor þi, all [i]f his my?t was more, þat [tyme] wold he not be breme. þer falshed schewed he þem be fore þat þe woman wysched þem well to deme. þan langer hym lyst not soiorne þore: he wyst þei ware [fayn] hym to fleme. he toke his men ylkon, all þat my?t armes beyre, And went to Askalone, A Cety walled fore were. 334 The Cety fell, so has he fun, to Ebrews, his helders of old, And þen in bondeyg ware þei bown. swylke tales to sampson sone þei told: Phylysteyns had þe gaudes be gun; sone ware þei feld os fee in fold. þat Cety sone so he wun Ebrews to weld yt, as þei wold. þen fayrd he furth þem fro, And so his way he wendes To soiorne in Sarra with his fader and his frendes. 335 þer wuned he with þem mony a weke, for of his fayre þei war full fayn. Of sersyns syde none he for soke; who wold hym ware, sone ware þei slayn Tyll at the last talent hym toke to Tanna forto turne agayn hys wyfe, þat he lufyd, forto loke, for whor he lufed he cowd not layn. All yf scho fawted be fore, ?ett wold he frayst hyr ferr. And so when he come þore, he fand hyr werkand werre. 336 Sampson was for geyttyn þan, os vnkouth man þat is vnknawn, And scho wede with an oþer man, þat vsed hyr euynly os his awn. þen sampson bytturly can bane and sayd scho suld be hanged and drawn. And bettur consell none he cane bot stroye þe sede þat þei haue sawn. he was so mased and moued, full mony he dang to dede, And cautels he controuyd to harme all þer kynred. 337 In þat same tym men suld be gyn þer cornes into þer howse to kest. he sembyld be a sutell gyn thre hunderth wulfes from est and west, And fyre brandes þat well wold byrne full fast vnto þer taylis he fest; þat made þem rasydly forto ryne to all was brent; so toy?t hym best. Cornes and wynes he dystroyd þat suld susteyn þer lyue. Of swylke maner he noyed phylysteyns for his wyfe. 338 yf he was wroth, none my?t hym wytt; he went and wund wher he was born. Phylysteyns had full grett dyspytt, for he had so dystroyd þer corne. þei sayd þei suld yt qwykly qwytt, and þerto haue þei othes sworne. ffull grett ost geydderd þei full tyte and sayd all Ebrews suld be lorne On lese þen þei wold send Sampson þem vntyll, Bonden both his hende, to werke with hym þer wyll. 339 When þat þis soynd to þem was send, þe Ebrews made full mekyll mone. þei had no fors þem to dyffend; þerfor þei ware full wyll of wone. No consell in þat case þei kend, bot to sampson þei wentt ylkon And told hym all þer tale to end, and helpe bot hym how þei had none. he bad þei suld hym bynd be lyue, no langer sese, Both hys handes hym be hynd so forto make þem pese. 340 þen ware þei bold when he þem bade: þei band his hend with cordes new. Vnto þe lord[es] þei haue hym lede, and in þat tyme þei toke a trew. when he with his enmyse was stede, þei wer full bown his bale to brew. Bot of þem was [he] not a dred; he toy?t þei suld [þat ryot] rew. So were Ebrews certayn þat pese suld stably stand, And phylysteyns was fayn, for þei had hym in hand. 341 hys frendes wer ?ett full wyll of rede, for þei wyst not what wold be tyde. his enmys bed no bettur b[e]de þen vmsett hym on ylka syde. he herd þem deme he suld be dede, and when þei war most in þer pride, he stert vp sternly in þat stede. to breke his bandes he wold not byd, Sone ware þe[i] sonder ylkon. þ[ei] my?t dere hym no dele, Bot wepyns had he ry?t none, and þei war armed well. 342 Non armowrs ne no helpe he hath, bot [well he] treste in goddes grace. And als god wold, ry?t so yt was: sone had he comforth in þat case. he fand a cheke bone of an asse full sodanly in þat same place. þerwith of pa[n]yms gart he passe A thowssand lyues in lytyll space; All þat hym batell bede ware skomfett sone and slayn. þei ware full fayn þat flede, and he leued alon. 343 he musterd þat he was myghty amang [þem] þat ware maysters mast. þen thanked he god full inwardly þat hym hade helped so in hast. ffor feghyng was his flesch so drye þat bown he was to gyfe þe gast. And watur myght he non come by; in byttur bale so was he brast. þen prayd he god in hy, als he at his awn lyst had send hym vyctorye, vochsaue to sleke his threyst. 344 god was ay bown his bale to bete and vnto beld hym forto bryng. þe Asse bown lay at his fette, wher with he can his enmys dyng. þerof com watur cold and sweytt, os yt ware of [a] well spryng. þat slekyd hys threyst and slaked his hette. he thankyd god euer of all thyng: ffyrst for the lyon he gafe hym grace to slo And sythyn in þis seson hath sayued his lyfe also. 345 þen wex he wygh, os he was are, by wonder werke þat þer was wroy?t. vnto his frendes fast can he fare, þat for hym had full mekyll toy?t. All þat for hym be fore had kare, he made þem myrth all þat he moyght, And all þo þat þer enmys ware, vnder þer bondowm hath he broy?t. whyls he wund in Sarraa, all folke he fand his frend, Bot sythyn to gasa toke hym talent to wend. 346 This gasa was a grett Cety; to fals phylesteyns yt fell. Of panyms wonned þer grett plente þat made grett maysterys þem a mell. ydder wentt sampson oft to see a damsell þat þer can dwell. None durst hym warne wher he wold be for talys þat þei of hym herd tell. he fand defawtes be fore phylysteyns forto treyst. Bot sythyn he mett with more þat made hym more abayst. 347 hys lufe he wold not hele ne hyde, for no man sayng sett he by. And so betyd yt on a tyde to gasa past he preuely. Bot sone phylesteyns hym aspyd, how he come with no cumpany, And how he buskyd hym forto abyd and all ny?t with his leman ly. By þer consell þei kest how þat he suld be tone And raysed owt of his rest and so sodanly slone. 348 þei wyll not fayle what so be fall; þerfor þer ?attes speyre þei fast And sett gud wache apon þe wall with wepyns þat full well wold last. þei say no syluer sayue hym sall; his pompe and pryd suld sone be past. Bot Sampson hath persayued all how þei his ded devysed and cast. when he hopyd no man herd, at mydny?t furth he meued And fand þe ?attes all sperred; þat gart hym be yll greuede. 349 þen wyst he well he was in wath; to god he prayd with steuyn full styll Att helpe hym forto scape fro scath sen all hys wele was in [his] wyll. þor schewed he sone þat he was wrath: both ?attes and post[es] he puld hym tyll, And on hys bake he bayre þem bath to Tabor, þat was A heygh hyll. Phylysteyns þ[at] hym hattes þan fand a fowle affray when þei saw þer ?attes both brokyn and borne a way. 350 ffull mekyll mone þei made þat morne, and carfull was þat cumpany; þat he ascaped þem toy?t yt scorne, for wo þei wyst wold fall þerby. wher he was sum dele frend be forne, þen was he foo and full enmy; wher he þem fand, none was for borne þat in phylysteyns wold affy. þem forto schame and schend with hand hade [he] none aw, And Ebrews he mayntend and gouarnd in goddes law. 351 with wemen wold he wun and wend; he ne roy?t whedder yt ware well or wrang. All [y]f phylysteyns ware noy?t his frend, of þem þe fayrest wold he fang. In soreth can a lady lend þat lemans lyfe had leued full lang. hys [hert all] hale [to] hare he mend; full mekyll myrth was þem amang. ffor scho wold hym be gyle with fayre chere scho hym fede. Bot he wyst of no wyle and was no thyng a drede. 352 Scho was full fayre of hyd and hew, bot of hyr luf scho was full ly?t. Of hyr condicions noy?t he knew; Dalyda þat damsell hey?t. Phylysteyns was euer vntrew. when [þei] of Sampson saw þis sy?t, ffull preuely þei can persew to marre his maystry yf þei my?t. þei wyst þat woman cowde dyssauyue hym by sum gyn. þerfor þei melled with mouyth to gayre þat bourd be gyne. 353 þei sayd þus, “Dalida, doy?tur dere, phylysteyns in þi fayth affy. Sampson, þi felow and þi fere, þou wott he is our werst enmy. wold þou qwayntly of hym enquere wher in his wyghtnes most may ly And warne vs, for we sall be nere. grett wrschep may þou wyn þerby. So may þou stynt all stryue, and gyftes we sall þe gyfe To lede a ladys lyue, os lang os þou may lyfe.” 354 “Syrs”, scho sayd, “I sall asay and fand sum of his fors to fell.” Sone aftur os he by hyr lay, full grett myrth made scho þem a mell. Scho sayd, “gud paramowre, I þe pray A lytyll tale me forto tell, Sen þou so mekyll of myghis may, wher in þi strengh is dy?t to dwell. So may I fully fele how þi luf to me lys.” he dowted hyr sum dele and answerd on þis wyse, 355 “yf I ware bown both hend and fette with cordes þat wald ry?t well last, So myght ylk man to be [me] mette, for þen ware all my power past.” þat scho hym lufed full well scho lett tyll he on slepe was faln full fast. Scho band hym full herd, I yow hette, and þen A grett cry vp scho cast, ffor þei þat can aspy suld wyn hym in þer weld. he stert vp stalworthyly; of hyr fayre noy?t he feled. 356 he wyst nothyng how scho had wrogh, for he persaued no perell ?ett. And þat hyr warke was wast, hyr toy?t; þerfor scho frest a noþer fytt. Scho sayd, “ser, and þou luf me oght, þou wold not se me soroand sytt And namly for a thyng of noy?t, qwylke by þi word þat I wold wytt: Wher in thy strengh is hyde. I kepe noy?t elles to craue. Sythyn als þi self wold byde, I wyll se yt to saue.” 357 he sayd, “dame, who so wold me bynd with twanges schorn owt of a hyde, Both my handes fast me be hynd, þen hastely war past my pryd.” when he on slepe ware wardly blynd, to bynd hym wold scho not abyd. And for phylesteyns suld hym fynd or he was lawse, on lowd scho cryde. he waked, os he noght wyst; þe bandes in sonder brayde. ffor scho hyr purpase myst, scho was no thyng well payd. 358 Bot furth ?ett, for scho wold not fayle, scho sayd, “sen I no ferther found, yll may me lyke my long trauele to be beswyked.” with þat scho swound. he sayd, “who so wold take a nale A[nd] fest yt fast in to the grownd, yf enmys wold me þen asayle, I suld haue no strengh in þat stownd.” Scho broy?t both nale and band and fest yt when he sleped And drof yt with hyr hand down into þe erth full depe. 359 Scho wakyn hym þen with a cry, for his enmyse suld here in hast. And when he start vp stallworthyly, þen wyst scho þat hyr werke was wast. ffull mekyll moyne scho made for þi and sayd, “in bayle euer I am brayst, Sen I se grayth incheson why þei lufe not me þat I luf mast.” Scho sayd in yre and angere, “sen I werke so in vayne, I sall lufe þem no langer þat lyst not luf a gayne.” 360 Sone has scho chosyn an oþer chare: scho weped and wrang both he[d] and hand. I deme hyr a dewle os I dare; scho mad hyr als scho my?t not stand. Now nedes Sampson forto be ware, les he [be] wrethed with his awn wand. Bot for he saw hyr sogaytes fare, he wex a foyle, and þat he fand. he sayd, “leman, be styll, no lenger lyst me layn. þou sall wytt all þi wyll; I say þe in certayn,” 361 “My my?t is haly in my hare so þat yf yt were cutt of clene, þen suld I be of my?t no mare þen oþer men be fore hath bene. Bot leman, loke þou layn þis lare; tell yt neuer bot vs two betwene!” “A luf,” scho sayd, “well leuer me ware forto be kylled with cayres kene. Derly I sall yt dyght both [by] ny?t and day fforto maynten þi my?t in all þat euer I may.” 362 So sall sampson be putt to p[y]n, þat maysteres mad full mony a myle. A woman with hyr weked ingyne has lorne þat led, alas þat whyle! Of hyr falshed scho wold not f[y]n; full freke scho was hym forto fyle. Scho dyd hym drynke of dyuerse wyn with grett gladnes hym to be gyle. So yll wemen wyll glose þem þat þei wold haue schent, ffor men sall not suppose in þem none yll entent. 363 hyre solace was to hys vn sele, be cawse scho kest hym to be tray. when he of wyn was dronkyn wele, þen was hys wytt all wast away. he fell on slepe and my?t not fele what folke to hym wold do or say. hys hare scho cutt of ylka dele, wher in his strengh and lykyng lay. þis was a de[l]full dede of all þat euer was told, ffor trest of mekyll mede made hyr to be so bold. 364 when þis was done, scho mad a schowtt, for enmys suld here, þat was hyd. he wakynd and went with owtyn dowt forto haue done, os he are dyde. Bot fals phylysteyns flokked abowt; to bynd hym sore non thurt þem byd. And both his eyn sone putt þei owt, be cause no kyndnes suld be kyd. To ga[?a] þei gart hym [ga] both blynd and bun in bandes. And þe dewle Dalyda was made lady of landes. 365 he þat my?t fell all folke be forn, now is he fast with feturs fest. Phylysteyns fast can hym scorne, for he had bene a greuus geyst. At qwernes þei gart hym grynd þer corn, and fylth oft in his face þei kest, And grett byrdyns þat suld be borne to gayr hym beyre so toy?t þem best þo fellows folke ware fayn to se hym fowle fare. Ebrews ware put to payn; his kynradyn had gre[t] kare. 366 In byttur bayle þus can he byde, ay bon to beyre what þei wold byde. All way with hym þei flott and chyde, bot in þe meyn tyd þus be tyde: his hare was waxin sum dele syde, wher in his strengh was holy hyd. þerfor to venge hym he aspyd on dedes þat dalyda hym dy[d]. Thrugh hi[r] gyltry was he full yll turment and tened, And venged wold he be, yf he hym self suld schend. 367 ylke ?ere þei vsed to make a fest, qwylk may not fayle, bot yf þei fon, And sacrafyce full mony a best vnto þer god þat hey?t Dagon. And now þei mad yt more honest, for þei had maystry of sampson. ydder þei semled, most and lest, and broy?t hym to be wonderd on. As a best þat was blynd he balturd furth þem by; Both be fore and be hynd þei bunsched hym bytterly. 368 In a palays þei hath purvayd þer mangery with mekyll pride. ffull ryally it was arayd with wyndows and with wardes wyd. Bot all on heyght þe halles was grayd and selers be neth in to abyd, And on a pyller war þei brayd þat bare vp all on ylka syde. Sampson be for had seen þe purpase of þat place; he toy?t at turne to tene þer sang and þer solace. 369 he prayd a boy þat lufed hym best vnto þe pyler hym forto lede þat he þer by his bake my?t rest, for of swylk helpe had he grett nede. Dame dalyda on deese was drest with mony a wy?t in worthy wede. The pyler gart he bow and brest þat all þe halle in sonder ?ede. yt bare down man and barne and slew þem all at ons Bot þe boy, þat he can warne to wend owt of the wons. 370 Ten milia phylysteyns and mo gart he be lorne in lytyll whyle, All for he wold þat woman slo þat with hyr gaudes can hym be gyll. Sampson hym selfe was ded also; he mogh not passe from þat perell. So wakynd weyre and mekyll wo all throw a wekyd woman wyle. The Ebrews all and sum gouernd [he] XX ?ere. Thus endes Iudicum, bot more ?ett men may lere. Ruth. 371 God þat weldes both wyld and tame in all our spekyng be our spede fforto be gyn withowtyn blame þis boke and make yt for our mede. A woman, þat heygh ruth be name, now forto neuyn of yt is nede. And this boke is named of the same, þe boke of rewth so we yt rede. Scho was playn pupplyst of kynred fayr and gud. Of hyr kynred com cryst and of þe jewes gentyll blud. 372 Aftur sampson dede, þat was dughty, of whom we told in tym be forn, Of Ebrews reygned on Ely þat mayntend þem both euyn and morn. And in bedlem, a burgh þer by, on Emalec was bred and born. he had a wyfe, hey?t Neomy, [and in þer tyme] fell defawt of corn. Semly suns had þei two: þe on was named chelon, And þat oþer of þoo, he was named Maalon. 373 hungur was in þat reme so ryfe, all Ebrews mad full yll chere. Emalec toke chylder and wyfe, and went þer way þei fawre in fere, To paynyms land to lenght þer lyfe, wher corn enogh was and not dere. And þor þei wund with owtyn stryfe with moabyse more þen tene ?ere. A wyfe þor wed chelon, orafayn, a woman wyse. Ruth mared with maalon, a paynyn of grett price. 374 Of Ebrews born both ware þe men, of Iacob kynd and jews cald; Phylysteyns ware þo fayre wemen, and paynyns law holy þei held. On þis wyse ware þei wede þen agayns þer law, bot so god wold, ffor crist suld com, os clerkes ken, of both þe braunches I are told. Emalec and his suns in þat land le[ft] þer lyues, And sythyn all same þor wonnes, þe moþer and two suns wyfes. 375 Bot þen þe moþer Neomy langed in to hyr land agayn: hyr lyked not paynyms cumpany, for of hyre fare ware þei not fayn. hyr suns wyfes was full wylly to wend with hyr, þis is certayn. Scho tuke ruth furth to be hyr by, and in þat land scho leued orfayn. Of on enogh hyr toy?t to led þe landes throgh. So ruth with hyr scho broy?t Euyn vnto bethlem burgh. 376 ydder þei wan withowtyn stryfe. hyr frendes be for full fayr scho fand, And sone þei asked hyr resons ryfe both of hyr suns and hir husband. Scho told how þei had leued þer lyf, and how þei past in paynyms land, And how ruth was hyr on sun wyfe and wold werke euyn os þei ordand. [She wold leve paynyms law and lere with all hir mayne] The god of jews to knaw. þerfor þei ware of hyr fayn. 377 Ruth was ry?t fayr [of hew and hyd,] and scho lyued lely os a iew. To geydder so furth can þei byde; all folke hyr lufed fro þei hyr knew. So yt be tyd in heruest tyde when men suld schere þat þei ar sew, Ruth sayd scho wold wend þer be syd and glene þem corn [as for hyr dew]. “Doy?ghtur,” sayd Neomy, “go furth in my blessyng; Thy dyner dy?t sall I a gayns þi home comyng.” 378 So went scho furth on þe morne to glene and byrdyns forto beyre. A Bo?e, þat was in bethlem born, A dughty man in dedes of were, he geydderd his folke hym be forne into þe feld his corne to schere And fand þis woman gedderyng corn in Doles wher scho my?t do no dere. he asked of þem ylkon whethyn was þat woman fayre. The sayd, “þe wyf of maalon; to Emalec next hayre.” 379 “Scho soiourns in þis same Cety with Neomy, þy Neuow grett.” vnto þat semly þen sayd he, “wend with my men to drynke and ette And werke with þem in stede of me; all sa[l] be þin þat þou may gette.” Scho thanked hym with wordes fre þat [so] vowchsaue hyr to rehete. All day with þem scho wroy?t; þat dede dyd hyr no dere, ffor at euyn hom scho broy?t als mekyll os scho my?t beyre. 380 Scho told hyr dame how scho had done, for þat scho lengyd so lang a stage, And how bo?e bed hyr swylk a bone and werke and take hyr werke to wage þat Neomy toy?t hyr allon Amang þem forto make maryage. Scho wyst of bo?e: wyf had he none, and he was lord of hegh lynage. Scho sayd, “my doy?tur dere, vnto my tale take tent! To morn loke þou be nere ay in his awn present.” 381 “And when þou hath bene all þe day with hym and his folke in fel[l]es, wayt at euyn well, yf þou may lige in þe loge þat he in dwelles; And when þou sekes, yf he ogh say, say þat þou sekes hym and noy?t elles þe forto wys þe redy way to sum maryag þat he of mellys. loke þou be homly hyd to mette with hym at morne.” Euyn os scho demed, scho dyd. Bo?e fand hyr hym be forne. 382 when bo?e hyr herd, he hade pety how scho hyre mane vnto hym ment. he sayd, “here wuns in this Cety a ?ong man with ryue elders rent. hym sall I make to mary þe, or elles þe same sall I assent; þe herytage þen weld sall we.” þus told he hyr all hys entent. Scho was full fayn for þi, and als sone as scho mogh, Scho told to Neomy on what wyse scho had wroy?t. 383 þen Neomy was farly fayn: on grownd was no thyng þat hyr greued. ffor well scho wyst hyr selfe certayn þat ruth full sone suld be releued. Sone Bo?e gart summond ilke [cyteseyn] and sayd þem how þis mater meued. And to þe ?ong man told he playn how þat þe woman was myschewed, And þat he suld assent to be husband and hede, Or els refuse þe rent þat com of hyr kynred. 384 þe ?ong man answerd curtasly and sayd þus in þar aller sy?t, “I luf an oþer to lyg me by; hyr wyll I hold, os I haue hey?t.” þen answerd Bo?e, “ruth wed wyll I and haue hir rent os [yt is ry?t].” To þis acordes this cumpany, so wedded he þat worthy wy?t. The rent he con restore vnto hym and hys wyfe. Os elders dyd be fore, he vsed yt in þer lyfe. 385 In the spowsall ware þei copyld clene; os god wold, so was done in dede. he was Ebrew and scho panym, bot by goddes law þer lyfe þei lede. A sone þei hade sone þem be twen, qwylke obeth hey?t who wyll take hed. And of hym withowtyn wene Iesse [was rutt. of hym], we rede, how sythyn com Dauyd kyng, þat was chefe Iuge of Iewys. þus iesus crist wold spryng of paynyms and Ebrews. 386 And on what wyse he sprang and spred mone aftur com in carpyng clene. þen ware no ledes þat lyf led bot only Ebrew and paynym. The boke of Ruth þus haue we rede of faders þat be fore haue bene. In lytyll spech we haue yt sped, þat mony mater may be mene. And next now aftur þis begyns þe boke of kynges. he bryng vs to his blyse, þat lord ys of all thynges. Primus liber Regum. 387 God þat gouerans all thynges and my?t fully made more and lese, In whom our helpe all holy hynges, he graunt vs grace of his gudnese fforto be gyne þe boke of kynges and further yt furth in fayr processe, Als holy chyrch heyre says and synges, and as þe bybyll proves expresse how prophet[es] fyrst be gane goddes priuate furth to beyre, how kynges wrschepe wane be dyuerse dedes of were. 388 Ther wuned A man in ramatha, A gentyll Cety of þe Iury, And his name was cald Elcana; amang all oþer most my?ty. he had two wyfes: on hey?t Anna; scho was barand of hyr body. hys secund wyfe hey?t fenenna, bot scho had barns hyr husband by. The costome þen was þore, þat sythyn hath bene vn toyght: No wemen wrschept wore bot þoo þat frutt furth broy?t. 389 helcana, þat was full wyse, lufed Anna well, for scho was fayre. Bot all way was scho lesse in prese, by cawse scho broy?t hym furth non ayre. þei vsed þen ylke ?ere ons or twyse vnto the tempyll all folke to care And þer forto make sacrafyce to god, þat gouerans erth and ayre. And fell þat helcana with wyfe[s] and chyld[er] wentt þar sacrafyce to make to god with gud entent. 390 [þei] broy?t with þem both bred and wyne, aftur þer folke ware fele or fone. and þor þei sett þem down at dyne when þei þer sacrafyce had done. he parted þen Anna to pyne, for vnto hyr he gaf bot one, And to fenenna fele and fyne, for scho had chylder and þat oþer none. when scho saw ffenenna for hyre chylder well fayre, Scho weped and was full wo, for scho no barns bare. 391 Scho rose and went withowtyn rest to þe tempyll wher þe arke of god stud. And þor scho fell in prayers prest and prayd to god, þat gyfes all gud, hys grace in hyre forto fest and send a sun to mend hyr mode. So carefull cowntenance furth scho cast þat Ely wened scho had bene wode. And vnto hyr sayd he, “dame, þou takes no kepe All [y]f þou dronkyn be. greue not god, go slepe!” 392 “A mercy, ser”, scho sayd, “do way, my sorow sall þou vnderstand. To god is þat I cry and pray to haue a sun with my husband. And sertes, ser, yf I so may, to god here sall [he] be seruand.” When hely herd hyr so say, he prayd for hyr with hert and hand. þen sone toke helcana his chylder and wyfes two And went in to Ramatha, þat town þat þei come fro. 393 Sone aftur þis so yt be fell: Anna consaued, os god vowche sayue, And bare A sun, hey?t samuell, as scho full oft cane aftur craue. grett myrth was made þen þem amell for comforth of þat lytyll knaue. In þe tempyll was he dy?t to dwell, ose sone os he hym self can saue. hys moyder made offerand of hym, os scho had hey?t, fforto be goddes seruand dewly both day and ny?t. 394 In goddes seruyce so con he lend, a full fayre chyld of hyd and hew. And by XII ?eres was past tyll end, he cowth enogh of nurtur new: [t]he gast of god in hym dyscend, wher by he cowth tell talys trew. how thynges suld both be gyn and end, be prophecy full well he knew. So aftur ?eres XII Ely, þe prophett wyse, held Samuel nex his self in all sufferand seruyce. 395 Two suns with his wyfe had Ely, for samyn wuned bot[h] scho and hee: On fynyes, þat oþer Ofny, two semly chylder forto se. Bot both þei lyued in lechery and dred not god in no degre. þer fader þem fauerd, and for þi to fowll endyng þei fell all thre. þe sacrafyce þei stall to fynd þer barns brede; þerfor þem self had bayle and oþer of þer kynred. 396 ffor þi ys goyd e þei tent to skyll þat haluyd thyng has forto ?eme, B[e] þer defawt þat no thyng spyll; ne in beyryng be not to breme, Ne take no thyng þem self vntyll þat vnto goddes seruyce suld seme; And be euer ware with werkes yll for dow[t] of hym þat all sall deme. And chastys þer chylder well all way when þei do o mysse þat þei no fawtes fele, as Ely feled for hys. 397 Now wyll we rede and reherse [ry?t] how god to Samuell can apeyre. As he lay slepand on a ny?t in þe tempyll, hys mayster nere, he herd a voyce call hym on hey?t, “Samuell, Samuell!” [sithes] s[er]. he rayse hym vp and wentt full wygh vnto his mayster with myre chere And sayd, “ser, wyll ?e oght, I com yow forto kepe; ?e cald me als me toy?t.” he sayd, “nay sun, go slepe!” 398 he wentt and layd hym down agayn, and hastely on slepe he fell. And sone he herd þe same steuyn [certayn] cald on hym and sayd, “samuell!” he royse and wentt with pase full playn, and to his maystur so can he tell. þen Ely wyst and was full fayn þat god apered þore þem a mell, “go slepe my son so dere, and yf on speke þe tyll, Say þus, ‘lord, I am here; tell me what is þi wyll’.” 399 he sleped in his howse at hame, and sone when he to bed was broy?t, A voyce come and cald hym by name; and [he] sayd, “lord, þi seruant vn soy?t wyll werke þi wyll of wyld and tame.” þen answerd god, as hym gud toy?t, “All Jacob suns sall suffer schame for wekyd dedes þat þei haue wroy?t. Ely þat þou wyt wunes sall sone dye sodanly, ffor he suffers hys suns vse theft and lechery.” 400 þus sayd god vnto samuel of fell defawtes þat folke suld fele. vnto his maystur con he tell how god had demed ylka dele. And when Ely had herd his spell, þat god was greued þen wyst he wele, And in prayers full fast he fell to saue hys suns fro þe vnsele. Bot no poyntt my?t be feld þat samuel sayd suld sew. ffrom þen furth folke hym held for prophett, trest and trew. 401 Sone aftur fell þat phylysteyns mad grett semblyng on ylka syde Of pepyll þat were all paynyms, for both þo names þei bare þat tyde. On Jacob suns, þat heyght Ebrews, come þei to were with mekyll pride And says þei sall, what so yt meuys, be bet or bun all þat wyll abyd. Cetyes and towns þei breynt ouer all in ebrews land. Both cornys and wyns þei schent and stroyd all þat suld stand. 402 Sone Ebrews herd and saw þis sy?t þat forto byde þei had no beld; Trowgh owt þer reme þei raysed ry?t all wyght men þat my?t wepyns weld. Agayns phylysteyns for to fy?t þei sped þem fast with spere and scheld. Bot smertly ware þei putt to flygh, and fals phylysteyns had þe feld. þat day was dede and takyn ten thowssand, says þe boke. So god had þem forsakyn, for þei his law for soke. 403 The Ebrews toy?t both scath and scorne þat þei suld fro phylysteyns flee. þei sembled folk fast on þe morne and sayd þei suld þer solace see. The arke of god furth haue þei borne; þer with þei wene to wyne degre. Bot for þei had þer laws lorne, god wold no werke ne with þem be. Of Ebrews sone was slayne moe þen thrytty thowssand; þe Arke of god was tone and led to hethyn land. 404 þus Ebrews þat was putt in prese war all vm cast with cares cold. ffelesteyns þer can full fast encresse, for þei had godes arke in wold. Bot both Ofny and fynyes, Ely suns þat I ayre of told, þor leued þer lyues with owtyn lesse. and þer fader, [f]or he was old, when he herd tythynges tell þat his two suns was slayn, Down fro his sege he fell bakward and brast his brayn. 405 þus Ely and his suns was sloyn, and Ebrews all was schent for syn. þe arke of god from þem was gone with fellows folk fylystyen. þei sett yt be þer god Dagon, for þei to hym wold wrschepe wyne. Bot vengance sone on þem was tone: he fell and brake both bone and skyne. And more harme sone at hand fell ouer all þat Cetye: grett myse groyved owt of sand, an vgly sy?t to se. 406 þei ette þo folke, both flesch and blod; þei had no fors þem to dyffend. þer bowels royted wher þei stod; þer was no medcyn þem to mend. Mony thowssand for woo were wod. this vengiance god apon þem send, ffor þe arke of god, þat was so gud, was haldyn þen in hethyn hend. þei toke consell þat tyde and send yt fro Assoton To a cyte þer be syde, þat named was askalon. 407 Bot als sone ose þei toke entent to mayntein yt þor þem amell, All þe same harme sone had hent: þei royted and ranked flesch and fell. To V Cetys so was yt sent, and in ylka place os yt can dwell, Sone all the folke ware schamly schent, so grett nowmer þat non my?t tell. þen þei toy?t and sayd, when þei sufferd so sore, þat god was noy?t well payd his Arke was holdyn þore. 408 ffor yt gart all þat greuance groyue of sorows þat ware to þem soy?t.

Bot bethsamys was ferly fayn when þei þe arke in þer feld fand. procession went þei þore agayn and gafe to yt full grett offerand: The oxin and the chare þei bryntt be fore þe tabernakyll. To þe jew[ell]s toke þei tent in mynd of þis merakyll. 411 þen wrschept yt was worthyly. bot for þat þei vn worthy were, Moyses ordand in all þe jewry þat non suld negh goddes arke so nere Bot only þe lynage of leuy, pristes or dekyns knawn for clere; Thies folke was not so, and for þi þer boldnes sone þei boy?t full dere: vengiance com sone vnsoyght apon sexty thowssand.

Ay whyls þei wold god plese, of no thyng had þei nede. 413 Samuel was sufferan cald and leyrer of þer laws full lang. Two suns he had, wyght men and bold, þat melled þem of þe law amang. Bot þer Iugementes oft sythys þei sold and turned þe ry?t oft vnto þe wrang.

And Comyn pepyll can þem pleyn to Samuell, and þus þei sayd, “Syr, þe semys sone to passe hene, for eld þi face is all afrayd. To forther vs þou suld not feyne, our gouernance of mysse is grayd. þerfor, ser, of þis thyng we pray þe euere ylkon: Ordand ouer vs a kyng to gyd vs when þou art gone.” 415 “Euer ylka nacion bot we hath kynges chosyn at þer awn chose.

Bot all his wordes was in vayn: þei answerd spytfully in þat [sp]ace, “ser, we wyll haue a kyng certayn, as þe pepyll hath in oþer place, To mayntein vs with my?t and mayn Agayns phylysteyns, [our] face.” he heyght þem forto haue a kyng in tyme comyng. þei keped noy?t els to craue; þe[n] hom went old and ?yng. 419 In masphat soyournd samuel and mad gret mornyng for þer mysse. And in þat same Cyte can dwell A nobyll man, was named Cys. he had a sun, Saul to tell, a cumly chyld to clype and kyse. And in þat same tym so be fell þat asses was with rachyd of hys. he bad with wordes meke saul, his sun certayn, wend furth his bestes to seke and bryng þem home agayn. 420 Saul was both meke and myld to fyll his fader commawndment. he toke with hym an oþer chyld for feleschepe, and furth þei went. þei soy?t be ways and wastes wyld þe assys þat þei to seke ware sent. þei fand none þat cowde be þer byld to tell in what land þei ware lent. Saul Sayd, “we wyll gang vnto my fader agayn; hym thynke we dwell full lang, and our gatt ys in vayne.” 421 hys seruand sayd, “nay, ser, lett vs byde sum bettur bodword home to bryng. Samuel wunes heyr be syde, a wyse prophett þat wott all thyng. he sall vs tell in full schort tyde of our bestes sum trew tythyng. Sen we haue wasted ways wyde, our help now in his hand may hyng.” Saul full sone assent; þis way he wold not lett. To þe Cyte þei wentt, and samuel sone þei mett. 422 þei prayd hym wysch þem, yf he my?t, to þer assys þat went ware wrang. he sayd, “suns, dwels with me all ny?t; þen sall ?e wytt, or ?e gang.” he saw saul semly to sy?t and of fayr stature to be strang, And werned he was from heuyn on hey?t þat he suld be kyng Ebrews amang. ffolke dyde seruyce þat day, full grett ose custom kend, And to god can þei pray sum gud kyng þem to send. 423 And when þat wrschepe was all done and tyme was for þe folke to twen, The prophett at þe howre of noyne toke þoo two chylder to his yne, And wheder folke ware felle or fone, he dyde saule þe deyse be gyne And made hym to be serued sone, als he ware comyn of kynges kyne. Ebrews had all ferly why þat þis werke was wroy?t. Samuel wold not say why; he wyst þat þei wyst noy?t. 424 þat he suld be kyng well he kend; þerfor he rewled in swylke aray. In his awn loge þat ny?t þei lend, and on þe morn when yt was day, with þem he ordand hym to wende and toke saul be syd þe way And sayd, “þus god hath me send all his entent to þe at say. To I haue told my toy?t, byd þi felow furth goo, ffor what god wyll [b]e wroy?t sall non wytt bot we two.” 425 he dyde hys seruant hym withdraw, and þen he sayd, “saul, take hede! god hath so ordand þat þe aw his folke in land to lere and lede. And for þer kyng þei sall þe knaw and sewt and seruyce to þe bede. Ay whyls þou lufes god and his law, he wyll be nere in all þi nede. And yf þou wyll ga wrang and werke agayns his wyll, þi lordschep lastes not lang. þerfor take tent þer tyll!” 426 he toke oyle, os god had hym kend, þat blessed was of god be fore, And an oynt hym both hed and hend and cald hymkyng and kyssed hym þore. And sythyn to god he hym be kend and told hym wher his assys wore And þe ry?t way how he suld wend, and ?ett þat tym he told hym more. “ffull semly chylder III, sun”, he sayd, “sall þou mette.

And when þe terme is comyn to end, þat we haue tane be twyx vs two, To Masphat sall we same wend.” so ylkon cayred wher þei come fro. þe maters þat þe prophet mened, euyn in þer fayre þei fand þem so. Saul sone told full euyn his fader of all his fare, Bot no thyng wold he neuyn of kyndom forto declare. 429 when þe seson come þat þei had sett, to masphat geydderd full gret wone. þer Samuel and saul mete with my?t[y] Ebrews mony one, ffor in þat place he had þem hett to haue a kyng whore þei had none. And lottes þei layd with outyn lett of what kynred kyng suld be tone. ffor so assent þei all, and sone when þei be g[y]ne, The lott con ly?t and fall on þe lyne of Beniamyn. 430 þen sone þei layd þer lottes agayn [to wit which man shuld amend theire mys, And soone it light, is noght at layne,] apon saul, þe sun of Cys. þen samuel sayd, “sers, certayn be cowrse of kynd your kyng he ys.” þe Ebrews answerd and ware fayn. kyng my?t he be with mekyll blyse. he was cumly to ken, of breyd and heyghnes als, A bowe all oþer men both be þe hede and þe hals. 431 þei rayssed hym vp into a stall on heyght þat all men my?t hym see. þei kneled on knesse and kyng hym cal[l], as costom was in þat cuntre. þe[n] Samuel sayd vnto þem all, “sers, all your ?ernyng now haue ?e. what fayre to yow ferther fall, sett no defawt to god ne me. Sen ?e haue god forsakyn and his doyng ylka dele And to a kyng yow takyn, loke þat ?e luf hym wele.” 432 “And kepe þe lawes þat moyses kend, leese þat ?e ?eld your self to spyll.” þen lyst þem þore no langer lend, bot ylk man went at þer awn wyll. wyse Ebrews with þer kyng con wend redy hys bedyng to fulfyll. Sum oþer foyles can yt dyffend and sayd þei assent not þer tyll. Bot sythyn when þei saw his gudly gouernance, þen to hym can þei draw for dowt of aftur chaunce. 433 Saul was ordand on þis wyse kyng of þe Ebrews, all and sum. he sett his reme in gud assyce and wroy?t by Samuel wysdum. Sythyn Naas, kyng of amanys, þ[a]t wund full ferre be ?ond þe flome, Ordand hym redely forto ryse with cuntreys þat to hym wold come. Ebrews he con dystroy, euer als he my?t þem geyte, And none my?t to hym noye, so was hys power grete. 434 he byrns þer towns and þer Cetyes and stroys þer catell, corn and wyne. þe febyll folke þat hym not flees to fell [al]so he wyll not fyne. All þat he sees sone sall chese on of þo twa to take or tyne: Auder the ryght Eye forto lese, or suffer ded with dew[l]full pyne. þus mekyll folke was slayn, þat wold þem fend with fy?t, And mony was put to payn thrugh losyng of þer sy?t. 435 So wendes he furth and neuer fynys, bot euer his cumpany encresse vnto he come to galadyns in a cyte, þat heyt Iab[e]se. þer settes he gybcrokes and engyns; of þat sawt he wyll not sese Tyll all with in be put to pyns. and at the last þer cheftans chese At ?eld þem to Naas, þer Cyte so to [h]aue And wel[d] all þat þor was, þer lyfes alone to [s]aue. 436 when Naas herd þer resons ryfe, he sayd þei suld chese on of two: he þat wyll ?eld hym sall haue lyfe, bot hys ry?t Eye sall he forgo; “And all þo þat wyll stand with stryfe we sall not sese, or we þem slo.” þen weped sore both man and wyfe. þei cowd not wele þe werse of [þ]o, Bot of pece þei hym prayd [t]o seuyn days ware past, “ffor sertes, ser,” þei sayd, “no langer may we last.” 437 [þe] kyng kest hym noy?t to remoue bot styll to abyd in þat [same] stede. And comforth to þem non he knew bot þe seuynt day to suffer dede. þerfor þat tyme hee grawntt trew, and þei sent furth full fast on hede To saul þat was kyng [of] new and told how þei ware wyll of rede. “Our carfull end we kene bot þou vs sone releue. Sen we ar made þi men, helpe to mend our myschefe!” 438 when saul herd tell þis trayn, amang his men he made grett mone And sayd he wold dyffend þam fayn; so sayd his ebrews ylk one. he bad þe messyngers wend agayn and hald þe trew þat þei had tone. ffor socour sall þei haue certayn or thre days next be comyn and gone. þei wentt, as he þem bad, full tyte vnto Iabes. þen Gabonyse was glad when þei happyn to haue pese. 439 The kyng saule in his mynd hath ment how he my?t semyll his pepyll sone. Ane ox he dyd [br]yng in present and bad he suld to ded be done. þare of to [sere] Cetys he sent and sayd, whedder þei had fele or fone, þar bestes suld haue þe same jugment bot yf þei hastyd withoutyn hoyne To wend with hym in ware þer enmys owt to dryfe. All þat my?t armys beyr was bown to go be lyfe. 440 The kyng gart nowmer þem and tell, þem þat suld come in company. þei fand [of] folke of israel sex C M men my?ty, And of Juda als fell þer fell, þe nowmers ar not forto dyscrye. vnto þem all sayd samuel, “wendes furth, ?e sall [haue] þe vyctory. fforto dyffend your ry?t þat enmys hath ou[t]rayd God wyll enforc your fy?t. þerfor be noy?t afrayd!” 441 kyng saull with his host is wun to jabes, wher þe phylysteyns dwell. þe fellows folke sone hath he fone, þat sorely soiornd in þer sell. In a mornyng be for þe sun with all host [on] þem [he] fell And bett þem doun os bestes bun. þor was no more tale to tell. Or þei my?t wepyns weld to were þemself fro wo, ware þei feld in þe feld þat none my?t flytt þer fro. 442 Naas, þat wold no rawnson take b[ot] Eyne of all þat he my?t hent, now my?t no man his sorow slake tyll Eyne and eyrs and all ware schent. þe Ebrews now may myrthys make, þat late be for of mornyng ment, And fals phylysteyns for þer sake owt of þis werld with wo ar went. kyng Saul slogh þat day a hunderth with his handes, And wan wrschepe for ay to hym and all his landes. 443 This was fyrst chaunce of cheualry þat kyng saul fell in þis case. grett boldnes hath his folke þerby and grett ferdnes to all his face. ffolke þat be fore was not frendly, now ware þei fayn at fall to grace. And he had my?t þen and maystry on all ebrews in ylka place. þei gat, both grett and small, þat my?t full gretly gayn, And home þei went with all; þa[n] ware þe folke vn slayn. 444 þei thanked samuel of þis thyng, for by his wytt þei wroy?t allway. And lowd þei kest vp a cryyng, and to þe kyng þus can þei pray, “yf any Ebrews, old or ?yng, þat ow to lyfe be moyses lay, And wyll not knaw þe for þer kyng,” þat þei be done to ded þis day, All for þei suld be flayd þat fyrst was turned hym fro. Bot he answerd and sayd, “god wold not we dyd so.” 445 “Sen god hath [?]yfyn vs vyctory and our enmys on kares cast, he wyll þat [w]e for gyf gladly all þo þat to vs haue trespast. All þat wyll mekly aske mercy sall haue our frendschep full and fast.” The pepyll prayssed hym fast for þi and sayd his lordschep lang suld last. So was all folk his frend, and none groched hym agayn, ffor hys wordes fayr and hend all ware to his bod bayn. 446 Samuel says, “sers, yow avyse qwat lordschepe god hath yow sent! loues hym with all your sacrafyce of all his grace with gud entent!” So dyd þei ylkon on þer wyse, and vnto Saul sone þei went And raysed hym kyng. þen was yt thryse with þe fyrst tyme þat he toke vntment. So was he kyng hym selfe lordschep to haue and hald Ouer all þe kynredes twelue þat Iacob suns was cald. 447 Now for þer names so oft tyms news, to what entent now wyll I tell: Of abraham ware þei cald Ebrews; with forme faders so yt be fell. And of Iuda þei ware cald jews and with sum chylder of israel. Of canan ware þei cald cananews. so in sere cuntres os þei dwell, Be sere names ware þei kend, als clerkes well declare, And god can with þem lend ay whyls þei luf his lare. 448 þen samuel sayd, “sers, I yow pray þat ?e wyll tell heyr to your kyng yf I dyd euer by ny?t or day trespase to yow, old or ?yng, Or toke your catell, corn or hay, ox or asse or oþer thyng.” þei sayd, “ser, forsoth nay! ?e greued vs neuer in gouernyng.” “þen haue ?e now mystakyn and serued to suffer pyne, Sen ?e hath both forsakyn goddes gouernance and myne.” 449 “And yf god with yow greued be, for ?e haue groched hym a gayn, pray we hym, both I and ?e, þat he send vs sum seyn certayn Of his greuance in þis degre.” and soyn he sent a proyfe full playn: Swylke wedder þat wonder was to se of thonour, leuynyng, hayle and rayne And frost, full fell and kene, þat be fore was full clere. Swylke wedders was neuer seyne in þat tyme of þe ?ere. 450 ffor þen þei had þer har[vest] grayd to geydder home, both wyn and corne. þen wyst þei well god was not payd, and þat þei had on myse þem born. Vnto þe prophett fast þei prayd, “haue mercy, els we be lorne.” “I sall pray for yow, sers”, he sayd, “bot haues mynd mydday and morn what grace god hath yow sent, als all your kynredes knaw. kepes well his commawndment and lelly lufes hys law.” 451 “ffor what tyme ?e breke his bedyng, your blyse mun with bale be blend; And bees curtase vnto your kyng with all your my?t his myrth to mend; And honers [hym] ouer all erthly thyng, and wendes ylk man wher [h]e wyll [wend].” And þus þei parted, old and ?yng, wher þei ware leuest forto lend. kyng saul had a sun, þat named was Ionata, Qwylk aftur furth was fun [gentyll] with mony ma. 452 In þis meyn tyme the kyng herd tell of n[ew] [tythandes] þat was nere at hand: Phylysteyns þat ware fers and fell war enturd into Ebrews land. In gabatha þore con þei dwell and stroyd all þat þei be fore [þem] fand And hasted to haue þem omell all þat [to] armys war ordand. And smithes smertly þei slogh and of Iren ylk thyng, Both fro wayn and ploy?t, and gart yt to þem bryng. 453 þe Ebrews þen yll angerd er: a way was born þat þem suld beld. þei had no wepyns þem with to were, all my?t þei [neuer] so well þem weld. Phylysteyns my?t þei do no dere, all yf þei fele say in [þe] feld. kyng saul wold fayn þem to fere; he hastyd hym fast with spere and scheld. he toke thre thowsand men, to hym self [þa twa], þat he cowd kenest kene, and on [to] Ionata. 454 And fast þei went furth on þer way with oþer folke foloand in fere. Sone when phylysteyns herd say þat kyng saul suld com so nere, þei gouernd þe[m] in grett aray and sembled folke on sydes sere þat sexty thowsand sone had þei of knyghtes [kene] in armys clere And thrytty thowsand [e]ls, þat well my?t wepyns beyre, And mo þat no man tels on futte full wy?t in were. 455 yt was full semly sy?t to see of charyottes and of chyvalry. had þei lufed god in gud degre, þen ware yt daynty to dyscrye. when kyng saul come in cuntre in space, wher he my?t þem aspy, Dred sum dele in his hert had hee be cawse of so grett cumpany, And for dedes þei had done to dyuerse man and wyfe; And his folke ware bot fone with swylke a strengh forto stryfe. 456 Bot his kenes full well he kyd with all hys my?t þem forto mare. And when his folke herd how þei dyd, þen howped þei well forto haue ware. Sum fled, and sum in hoyles þem hyd; for ferd þen wold þei found no fare. þer ware bot few with hym abyd or þat wold negh þe pepyll nere. when he saw þei ware gone, h[is] teyne my?t no man tell. he wyst no bettur wone bot sent vnto Samuel. 457 hys moyn be messege can he ma þat he was ferd and faylyd my?t, how [he] and his sun Ionata ware ordand with þer foys to fy?t, And how his folke ware fled hym fra when þei of enmys had a sy?t; And prayd hym come to gabatha, for þore þei suld abyd hym ry?t. when samuel herd certayn how stratly he was sted, he send sone word agayn and bad, “be noy?t a dred!” 458 “ffor with in VII days aftur þis, says hym self I sall be þore, And tyll þat tyme, be gud a vyce, þat [he] gett best[es] a bowt ay whore, So þat we may make sacrafyce vnto our god þo folke be fore.” The kyng hath ordand [on] all wyse, als he send word and sum dele more. By cawse þe prophett dwellyd ouer þe terme þat was sett, The kyng more furth hym melled þen he suld do be dett. 459 when þe tym come þat was ordand, and no man come hys sytte to slake, And hys men wold not with hym stand, for wo vnwynly con þei wake, foleherdenes he toke on hand hym selfe þore sacrafyce to make. Then þe prophett come and foyles fand; he was full ferd for dred of wrake, ffor he had messege sent with wordes on þis wyse, Or he com in present to make [no] sacrafyce. 460 þer[for] he sentt hym sone his wage and sayd, “had þou not done þis dede, þi suns suld haue born heritage; now sall no frutt be of þi sede By cawse þou hath done þis owtrage, þat suld not passe bot be presthed. God hath ordand a lytyll page aftur þi days þis land to lede.” þus told he his entent to þe [kyng] and Ionata, And wroth his way he went [agayne to Ramatha.] 461 þen was þe kyng in mekyll dred, for hertyng of helpe he ne has. he toke apon hym hegh manhed, and furth full playnly con he pase. And thre C þen with hym ?ode of thre thowsand þat with hym was. þat was full lytyll folke to lede to hym and hys sun Ionatas. Ionatas persayued þat þei my?t not eschew þat chaunce To wyn wrschepe a way bot be goddes gouernance. 462 The panyms was so grett plente; on A hegh hyll loged þei lay. To stroy þer strengh fast stud he and mare þer my?t [y]f he may. he toke on of his awn mene?e, qwylke he treyst wold not hym betray, And sayd, “felow, com furth with me!” so preuely þei went þer way þat none wyst bot þei two; and euyn Abowt mydnyght To þat hyll con þei go, and þus þen sayd he ry?t, 463 “what I do loke þou do þe same, and þis sall be our segne certayn: yf any of þem neuyn me be name, þen sall we haue our purpase playn. And yf [þei] boldly wyll vs blame and none answer gyf vs agayn, þen is gud þat we hast vs hame, or els our traueyll turnes in vayne.” þor was no way to wend bot a strayt sty of stone. Clamerand on knese and hende by þat gatt ar þei gone. 464 with mekyll [payn so] can þei pase and come into þat euyn entre. On of þem wyst well who yt wase, and to his felow þus sayd he, “yonder ys comyn þe Iew Ionatas with mony mo of his mene?e.” þei loked on þem, þei cryd alas; soyne ware þei feld þat my?t not flee. þei ware kylled all vn cled; none my?t helpe oþer harmes. Down fro þat hyll þei fled and brake both leges and armes. 465 kyng saul sadly spyrd and spyed þer cowntenance forto kene, And whe[n] he herd how hegh þei cryed, vnto þe hyll he hasted þen. hys folke full fast to hym rel[y]ed þat be fore dared os dere in den, So þat he had be vnder tyde mo þen ten thowsand feghyng men. he saw phylysteyns fled and full radly remowed, his folke he fast arayd and þen pres[t]ely persewed. 466 ffayn wold he venge þe velany þat þei had stroyd both wyn and whett. on payn of cursyng dyde he crye þat non þat day suld tent to mette, And who so dyd, he sayd, suld dy, and þer to swere he othes full grett, So þat þei my?t haue þe vyctory or euyn, and þen suld all men ete. Bot hys [sun] Ionatas with his felow furth went; he wyst not, þore he was, of þe kynges commawndment. 467 Agayns his strake my?t no man stand, he feld phylysteyns, grett plente. So be a forest syd he fand hony camys in a holoo tree. Sone hent he owt on with his hand, to hold his hert þerof ete he. he dyd not ose þe kyng commawnd, so greued he god in þat degre. By þe sune was went west, þei had wun wrschepes grett. þen bad þe kyng þem rest and boldly drynke and ete. 468 ffull sewrly þat ny?t soiournd þei, for of Enmys had þei no dred. And on þe morn, when yt was day, the kyng his folke wold ferther lede. Vnto A prophett can he pray, Achyas heyght he, os we rede, þat he to god suld sumwhat say and wytt yf þat þei suld well spede. he prayd, os þe kyng hym bade, and fraynd how þei suld fare, Bot non answer he had. þen was þe kyng in care. 469 þen trowd he sum had done trespase. þerfor he fraynd his folke full fast, And forto wytt how þat yt was, lotes he cummand þem to cast. Sone þe lott fell on Ionatas. þen was þe kyng gretly a gast And sayd, “my sun, forfeytt þou has; þi lyf may now no langer last.” þen all þo folke in fere, when þei þe wordes herd, Mornyd and made yll chere, and Ionatas answerd. 470 he sayd, “sers, ?e sall vnderstand I forfeyt noy?t, þat is my treyst. I herd not how þe kyng commawnd, ne of his wyll no thyng I wyst. An hony combe for soth I fand and ete þerof to slake my threyst. yf I þerfor be law of land sall lose my lyf, do os yow lyst!” þei sayd all schortly, “nay, þat was neuer goddes wyll. Or þou suld dy þis day, fele folke suld fare full yll.” 471 vnto þer kyng all are þei gone and sayd, “for þi sun we wyll vs mell, Sen he hath sayued vs euer ylkon fro þe phylysteyns fals and fell. So sewr a souerand haue we none sayue þi self, þe soth to tell. þerfor we say, and he be slayn, we wyll no lenger with þe dwell.” þe kyng herd and toke hede how hertly þei hym crayued. ffor luf and als for dred he sayd he suld be saued. 472 þen ware þei glad, no wonder was; full [mekyll] mon for hym was ment. þei prayd þe prophet achias þat he and þei be hold assent Suld pray god forgyfe þat trespase, and so he grawnted with gud entent. þen þe kyng and Ionatas with mekyll gold a gayn ar wentt vnto þer places playne, wher þei be fore had bene. Sexty thowsand ware slayn of fals phylystyene. 473 when þei had þus phylysteyns feld and had ouer hand of all þer foys, The kyng of Ebrews with hym held of þe most hertyng þat he has. þen was no man agayn [hym] mel[d] bo[t] playn pece in ylka place: þei sett and sew and boy?t and sold and lyfed in lykyng full long space. he lede þem be þer law and gouernd þem goddes bydyng. All Ebrews, als þei ow, honerd hym as þer kyng. 474 kyng saul had suns thre all dedes to do at hys devyce. Ionatas þe fyrst was he, þat in all place wan grett price; þe secund, semly forto se, hey?t Jesus and the thryd melcheys. All ware þei fayr of face full free and þer warkes full wayre and wyse. And he had doy?turs two, at home wonnand with wyn. The ry?t names [was] of þoo mycoll and merobyn. 475 þus in delyce os he can dwell, all folke attendand hym vntyll, God sentt his prophett samuel at warn hym forto werke his wyll. On goddes behalf he con hym tell how þat þer elders war angerd yll with malachys, a folke full fell, þat spetuusly þer sped con spyll. when þei past fyrst þe flome, þat folke, full of þe feynd, letted þem forto come be ways wher þei sull wende. 476 þerfor he bad saul suld passe and putt þo paynyms all to p[y]n, wyfe and chyld, all þat þore was, Cytes, castels, corn and wyn, And leue on lyue nawder ox ne asse, cow ne calf, schepe ne swyne. “Tyll all be lorne þat lyf has, for nokyns fayntnes loke þou fyne. Take no parte of þer pelfe to part þi pepyll o mang! Ne sayue noy?t to þi selfe; wast all [els] dose þ[ou] wrang!” 477 kyng saule to his saws assent, and þerto hertly hath he heyght fforto fulfyll goddes commawndment of malachys with all his my?t. hee sembled folke, and furth þei wentt with sexty thowsand at a sy?t. þei stroyd Cytes and burghys brentt; phylysteyns fast þei feld with fy?t. ffro þei come in cuntree þat malachys wund in, þei feld both folke and fee and wasted all þat wold bryn. 478 Agag was kyng of malachys and led þe lordschepe of þat land. Soyne when he wyst on what kyn wyse kyng saul styrd with strang hand, hee redyd all his reme to ryse þer enmys styfly to gayn stand. Of knyghtes kene and princes of price full fell phylysteyns furth he fand. þer way þei wold not lett bot putt þem furth in prese. when þei and Ebrews mett, þor was no poynt of pese. 479 To se yt was a semly sy?t, who so hegh stud and beheld, Of penons and of baners bry?t with schaftes and mony a schynyng scheld. kyng saul kyd þat he was wy?t; his Ebrews boldly can he beld. phylysteyns so þe feld with fy?t þat sum for ferd forsoke þe feld. Men my?t see stedes stray þat þore allon was leued, And þer lordes how þei lay in ways with owtyn heuyd. 480 phylysteyns my?t no langer last; all went to bale þat wold abyd. with Ebrews ware þei all vm cast; þe fand no socur in no syde. when þei ware all with payns past þat in þe feld was fun þat tyde, Ebrews þen fowled furth full fast to stroy þer landes, lang and wyde. þei leued nothyng on lyfe þat ne to ded war dy?tt: Bot[h] man, chyld and wyfe, bestes and fowls of fly?t. 481 when þei had wasted on þis wyse ryche and pure, both old and ?yng, Saul was sett on couetyce, and sone forgatt he goddes bedyng. ffor agag was a prince of price; he hey?t hym [help], þat hethyn kyng, And fayrest bestes for sacrafyce he bad men suld furth with [þem] bryng. his folke saw he forfeytt. and lett so ly?tly þer by. þei toke what þei my?t gett to beyre with þem boldly. 482 So went þei home and wold not dwell; of þer werkyng well þem toygt. And sone þe prophett Samuel come furth to wytt how þei had wroy?t. And when he herd þe bestes bell and saw kyng agag with þem broy?t, he made grett manace þem o mell and sayd þat dede suld dere be boy?t ffor þei toke no reward to werke agayns goddes wyll, þat bad none suld be spayrd, noþer gud ne yll. 483 ffull sore he syght for þer sake and sayd þus to Saul, þe kyng, “how durst þou werke þis werke for wrake: oþer man or best from theyn to bryng?” he sayd, “ser, sacrafyce to make and gyfe þem vnto goddes louyng.” þen samuel sayd, “god wyll not take offerand of yll gottyn thyng, bot þo þat lely lyfes and kepes hys cummawndment, what gyft so þei to hym gyfe[s], þer to wyll he take tent.” 484 “how suld he take offerand to gre? all thyng hym self [sayd] suld be lorne. Both man and best he bad suld be fordown, wher þ[ou] þem fand be forne. heyr is þe kyng of þat cuntre, And best I here yow hath for borne. I warne þe: god is wrath with þe, for þou hath wayt hym with þis scorne. Thy werke þus wyll he ?eld: þi lordschep sall not last, And oþer þi welth sall weld þat in fayth wyll be fast.” 485 when kyng saul herd samuel so spytfully speke in þat [sp]ace, vnto his fette oft sythys he fell and prayd of god to geyte hym grace And to amend yt þem o mell, Als he wold consell in þat case. Bot for his wordes he wold not dwell; he saw no plessance in þat place. Sone fro þat pepyll he past ry?t way to ramatha, Bot þe kyng folowd fast; in hert he was full wa. 486 ffull [well] he wyst he suld be schentt; þat made [hym] hertly forto hast. The prophett by þe mantyll he hentt so þat [yt] rayue and worthed to wast. þen sayd þe prophett, “ser, take tent! þis sall þou trow and trewly trayst: Ry?t os þou has þe mantyll rentt, so sall þi reme fro þe be rast.” þen had þe kyng grett care, and oft he askyd mercy. “And þou þus fro me fare, my folke wyll haue ferly” 487 “And traw þat I haue done sum trayn and with sum grett thyng greued þe. and þerfor, gud ser, turn agayn with glad sembland þat þei may see And schew to me sum seyn certayn of lastand luf and of lewte.” he grawnted, and þen þe kyng was fayn sen þat my?t no bettur be. The prophett come and plessed and alowd ylka dede. þen was þe kyng well esed, bot in hert had he drede. 488 when þei herd tell of þis tythyng, þe pepyll was payd well enogh. þe prophett bad þei suld furth bryng Agag þat euer on dregh hym drogh. when he was broy?t at hys bydyng, he sayd, “þou hath wroy?t mekyll wogh. þat sall þou fynd be for our kyng.” þer with his awn hende he hym slogh. þen ry?t to ramatha þe prophett wentt in hy. þe kyng to galgala went with his cumpany. 489 Samuel of soroyng my?t not sesse, for kyng saul so wrang had wentt, By cause when god to kyng hym chese þen he anoynt hym with an oyntment. he prayd to god forto relesch þat grett greuance with gud entent, Bot he had answer to hald hym pece; all þat was sayd behoued be sentt. þei ware fast frendes be fore and of on consell kend; his mornyng was the more when he my?t not amend. 490 god sayd he suld swylk lufyng lett, for new gam vs bus be gyne. “Take þou þi boyst with þe oyle benett and wend to bedlem or þou blyne. þore sall þou fynd, fayr on his flett, A jew, jesse, of jacob kyn. gayre hys suns be for þe sette, for on of þem sall wrschep wyn. Enoynt hym to be kyng, Saul stede to restore, And haue þe same blessyng þat saul had be fore.” 491 he wentt and wold no langer stand or he þe wyll of god hath wroy?t. Jesse, þat gentyll jew, he fand in bethlem Cyte sone vnsoy?t. ffyrst he made þem make offerand and honer god, so hym gud toy?t. Sythyn he told hym new tythand and bad hys suns suld furth be broy?t. Sex suns ware sett on raw be lyue at his bedyng. þen prayd he god to schaw qwylke of þem suld be kyng. 492 All ware þei semly vnto sy?t; full wyght men ware þe eldyst two. he asked whedder of þem suld be dy?t. god answerd and sayd, “non of þo.” þen vnto jesse wentt he full ry?t and asked yf he had any mo. “?a, ser, a ?ong, þat dauid heyght is in the feld full fere vs fro Our catell forto geyte.” þen Samuel with gud chere Sayd, “sertes, I sall nott ete, or þat hyrdman be here.” 493 Dauid sone was aftur sentt, and fro he wyst, he wold not byde. he saw þe prophett in present and heylsyd hym hendly, noy?t to hyde. The prophett hym in armys hentt and told hym all what suld be tyde. vnto þer dyner þen þei wentt: he sett þe chyld hym self be syde, On þat oþer syde jesse and sythyn his breyþer all, ylkon in þer degree, aftur þer eld suld fall. 494 hee honerd hym on deyse þat day. his fader merueld what yt mentt. Sythyn to a preuay place went þei, and þore he told all his ententt. “my sun,” he sayd, “I sall þe say, fro god of heuyn þus am I sentt To warn þe of his wyll all way, grett lordschep sal be þe lentt.” he wyst withowtyn fayle god assent to þat same And bad hym kepe consell and a noynt hym be name. 495 when he hym so anoynt hath with holy oyle both hed and hende, þe gud gast, þat in saul was, in Dauid soyne con descende, And into þat place soyne con passe An euyll sprett of curssed kynd, þat dyd saul oft say alas, when hys blyse was with bale blend. Oft sythys hys solace sessed with syte and sorow sere, And Dauid euer encressed in wytt, als we sall here. 496 Samuel sayd, “sun, whyle þou is ?yng, lok þat þou gyfe þe to gud thewes, ffor god hath sayd þou sall be kyng and keper of all hys gud Ebrews. And þerfor, sun, lufe lele lyfyng and flee fro feleschep of schrews, And honere god ouer all thyng, þat swylke gud grace vnto þe schews. ffor whyls þou lufes hys lare and kepes hys cummawndment, All whyle sall þou well fare and neuer be schamed ne schent.” 497 when þis was sayd, þen samuel wentt to lend wher hym leuyst wore. And dauid styll at home con dwell in feld with his fader store. And in þat meyn tym he con hym mell of m[ynstralc]y ay more and more Tyll he cowd herpe, os we here tell, als well as [euer] was kend before. Now Dauid leue we here with hys herpe and hys slyng And tell how sorows sere come to saul þe kyng. 498 The sprett, þat I spake of are, þat loged was with hym to lende, Assayd hym oft with sorows s[a]re and wroy?t hym wo when he lest wened. he sentt for feysyke full wyd whare and clerkes, þat in swylke craftes [was] kend. Amang þem all þei cowd no mare, bot mynstralsy, þei sayd, my?t mend. þe harpe when he my?t here, þe sprett þat was with in Suld haue no grett powere to dere hym for þat dyne. 499 þen for þer tythyng in þat tyde he bad men gang to gette þat glee. And so sayd on, þat satt be syd, “In bethlem, ser, wuns on jesse; lett on go loke, no langer abyd, for a ?yng sun at home has hee, þat herpes well, ys not at hyde, and at your bydyng wyll he bee.” Messyngers sone was sentt to jesse for hys sun. So ?yng Dauid is went with þe kyng in cowrt to wun. 500 And soyne when saul saw þat chyld, he made grett solace for hys sake, By cawse he saw hym meke and myld and mynstralcy þat he cowd make. ffor when þe fend was woyd and wyld and with sere turmentes wold hym take, þen was þe harpe his boyt and byld, and song my?t sone his sorow slake. þerfor was dauid dere and in wrschep all way. None was þe kyng so nere, noþer by ny?t ne day. II Primus Liber Regum. 501 þus with the kyng wonnand he was, full well [b]e lufed with owtyn wene. Of prowes in all poyntes con he passe ouer all þat on his eld hath beyne. Bot þe kynges sun, heygh Ionatas, he lufed hym best of all be deyne. hys hert all holly to hym he has, and þat was oft sythis aftur seyne. None wyst he was a noynt bot the prophett and hee Tyll yt come to þe poynt þat god sayd yt suld bee. 502 Soyne messyngers musters [þem] o mell, of harms hard þei hard at hand: how þat phylysteyns, fers and fell, dystroyd all þat þei be fore fand, And how þei dy?t þem forto dwell tyll þei had wasted all ebrews land. kyng saul herd þis tythyng tell, hys ost full sone he had ordand. The chyld dauid he sentt to soyiourne forsoth [in] lye. To bethlem is he went and keped his faders fye. 503 kyng saul wold not rest to ryde, ne sesse to he of þem had sy?t Under a banke, wher þei abyde, with baners spred, of brad full bry?t; kyng saul on þe oþer syde, þe hyll be twen, was on a grett heght. So noþer towched oþer þat tyd. phylysteyns ware þe mo of my?t. kyng saul wyst full well god was not fully his frend. þerfor he drede sum dele agayns Enmys to wend. 504 Phylysteyns ware þe feller þen for a grett freke þat þei furth fand. On golyas ylk day be gan vp on þat hegh hyll forto stand; he bad Ebrews send furth a man to fy?t with hym hand for hand, And wheder of þem so maystry wan suld haue þe lordschep of þat land. he was both grettur and grym þen any man my?t suppose. þer durst non dele with hym for dred þat land to lose. 505 hys armour was passand to prays, and V hunderth on his hed he has. hys heyberke held of heuy pas VI C to wey with brase. In hys ax hede þat he suld rayse well sexty C weght þer was; And all of stele, þe story says, and brygh glyterand as any glas. he was a gremly geyst in feld to fynd be fore. All way þis cowrse he kest full XL days and more. 506 In þat seson was Dauid sent to þe sege at see his breyþer hende. he asked of men what he be ment þat on þe hyll alon can lend. And when þei told hym þer entent and how none durst fy?t with þat fend, he sayd, “all grace fro god is lent; vnto yond warlaw wyll I wend.” hys breyþer can hym blame, and fro care hym to kepe þei bad he suld hast hame and fede þer fader schepe. 507 The kyng herd tell of þis tythand, he gart foche Dauid hym be fore. Sone he sayd, “to leue þis land and lose þi lyf full lothe me ware. þou hath no strengh with hym to stand.” and þus þe chyld answerd hym þore, “My helpe ys h[o]ly in goddes hand, I wot his my?t is mekyll more. all yf yond man be strang, he lyuys not lafully. In goddes name I sall gang and fell hym sone for þi.” 508 when kyng saul saw for certayn þat he wold found þat fend to fere, he armyd hym at all peyssys playn and ordand hym scheld and spere. Bot þe chyld had no my?t ne mayn swylke weght on his body to bere. he sayd, “takes all þis geyre agayn; I am not wunt swylke wed to were. My slyng is nemyll enogh and best dyffence for me. wyld bestes þer with I slogh, þat flayd my fader fee.” 509 he toke his slyng and furth can found þat mawment yf he my?t to marre. he geydderd stones apon þe ground, swylk þat for his craft accordand were. Golias steyted in þat stound and cald hym fole when he was fere. “Boy, hopys þou I be a hound?” Dauid sayd, “sertes, I hold þe werre.” Golyas says, “go hom, þou barn, and leue þi berre! þo folke þat [þou fro come] sall by þis dede full dere.” 510 Dauid fast toke furth [his] slyng and a ston þat þerfor was fytte. Abowt his hed he can yt bryng, to tyme he saw wher yt suld sytt. he wated þe warlaw with a wryng and made hym wode owt of hys wytt. ffor Armour or for oþer thyng into þe harns he has hym hytt. ffor all þe lakes he ler[d] þe lyue þor he leued. Dauid with [his] awn sword swythly swapped of hys hed. 511 Phylysteyns herd þis note new; yf þei had noy ys not to hyde. ffull rasydly þei can remew and reydyd þem to ryn and ryde. kyng saul prestly can persew and foled fast to fell þer pryde. þat day was joy to mony jew to here the hethyn how þei cryde. XXX milia war slayn of folke þat my?t not flee. þei turned þen home agayn into þer awn cuntre. 512 with kyng saul was Dauid dere, for he had done þis doyghty[nes]. And all þe folke, both ferre and nere, gaf hym þe þrice of þ[at] prowesse. So ose þei com by Cyteys sere, all welcomd þem, os worthy es, with mynstralsy and mere chere of wyfes and maydyns, more and lesse. þo wyfes sang how saul slogh A thowssand with his hand; þe madyns sang and loghe, “Dauid slogh ten thowssand.” 513 when saul herd, he was sory. wyfes sayd he sloght A thowsan playn, And maydyns made þer melody þat Dauid had ten thowsand slayn. Of þis be gan full grett enuy and lasted lang, ys no[t] to layn. ffor in hys hert he thynkes [holy] how Samuel prophett sayd [certayn] [he] suld his lordschepe lose, for he brake goddes bydyng. þis sang made hym suppose þat Dauid suld be kyng. 514 Bot he wold mare hym, [y]f he my?t, þat he suld neuer þat fare fulfyll. he saw, for þis werke he had wroy?t, þat all men lufed hym lowd and styll. Sere sutelteys oft sythys he soy?t how he my?t sped hym forto spyll. Bot to hym self he wold say noy?t; Ne dauid toke no tent þer tyll. he provyd passand his eld of gud maners and my?t. ffro he cowde wepyns weld, to were was non so wyght. 515 kyng saul fayg[ed] hym with fayrhede and wayted euer to werke hym wo. he wyst well for hys doyghty dede þat phylysteyns ware hys foo. he ordand hym his ost to lede all way when þei to were suld goo. þat was noþer for lufe ne dred, bot þat Phylysteyns suld hym slo. Bot god was euer hys gyde his werke forto warrand. wher he suld gang or ryde, gud hape was [i]n his hand. 516 þen went Dauid with scheld and spere and styfly stud in mony a stowre. phylysteyns was he fayn to fere, in ylka feld he bare þe flour. All [welthys] þat he wan with were he sent to saul for socour. And þat he dyd dauid to dere god turned yt to his grett honour. þe kyng ay waytand was how he my?t werke hym wo, Bot þe kynges sun, Ionatas, fendyd hym ay þer fro. 517 As breþer ware þei fast in fere aþer to beld os oþer bad. All folke þem lufed, both fere and nere, in ylka sted wher þei ware sted. And mycoll, þe kynges doyghtur dere, Dauid hyr hert all holy hade. When he was moued to make yll chere, no myrth on mold my?t make hyr glad. And when þe pepyll hym plessed, and scho hys conforth kend, yf oþer had hyr dys[pl]essyd, þat medcyn moght amend. 518 In luf þus lang was scho led, scho had [no] lykyng of hi[re] lyfe. When he in any stoure was sted, þen wa[s] hyr mynd in mekyll stryfe. Scho swere þat no wy?t suld hyr wede, bot scho [my?t euer] be his wyfe. Scho had no beld at bowre ne bed; hyr care was kene as any knyfe. Scho changed hyde and hew, hyr fayrnes fast can fale. At þe last þe kyng yt knew and asked of his consaylle 519 [I]f þem toy?t yt ware well to do to gyf his doy?htur to dauid. And þei gafe consell all þerto: “non is so kumly in þis kyth. A semly copyll is of þem two, for both ar large of lym and lyth.” [The kyng assented it shuld be so, bot this forward he fest therwyth:] heydes of phylesteyns two hunderth suld he bryng. with þis ylk wyle he wenys Dauid suld make endyng. 520 ffull well he trawd by þis yll trayn Dauid to lose in lytyll stound, And or he had two hunderth slayn forto haue mony a wekyd wound. Bot Dauid of þa[t] fayr was fayn; he gatt felows with hym to found, ffor Mycoll luf hym lyst not layn. Philysteyns fast he fell to þe ground. Two hunderth hedes certan ware neuynd to hym be name, Bot when he come agayn, fyfe hunderth broy?t he hame. 521 þen was he praysed with man and page with sere solace þat to hym soy?t. þei sayd he was well worthy his wage for þis ylke warke þat he had wroy?t, þat so had sterd hym in þat stage. fyue hunderth hedes with hym he broy?t. þe kyng þen made þe mayreg, bot euyll ay [was] in hys toy?t: Sere cawtels oft he cast Dauid to schame and schend. All turned to þe best, for god was euer his frend. 522 Soyne aftur þis so yt fell: Phylysteyns, full of enuy, Dy?t þem and wold no langer dwell to be venged of þer velany. when kyng saul herd tythyng tell þat enmys com In opynly, he demyd dauid with þem to mell, and als he [hey?t], he dyde in hye. ffelows þat wold not fayle ar gladly with hym gone. þai vencusyd þe batele and gat gud full grett wone. 523 þen with all folk was dauid dred and hownerd for his dughty dede. when saul herd he had well sped, þen in his hert he had more drede. Down he fell seke in his bede, for ferd Dauid þat land suld lede. hys yll sprett soyn hym spred; no speciall spech my?t hym spe[d]e. Dauid was aftur sent by hym to harpe and syng And all to euyll entent in bale hym forto bryng. 524 Dauid hym dy?t to do his dett: þe kyng fro wo yf he my?t were. As he with harpe to syng was sett þe fend fers so forto fere, The kyng hath cast his lake to lett; withowtyn spech he spens a spere. To Dauid euyn he toke his mett thrugh þe body hym to bere. þen Mycol kest a cry, and Dauid turned hym soyne. ffast home he can hym hye. god wold noy?th yt were doyne. 525 þe kyng was þen all wode for wo; þat he so scaped, hym toy?t scorne. he bad wy?t men be lyue suld go and lyg in wayt vntyll morn, And þat he suld not scape þem fro, for forfetur my?t fall þerforn. he suld not lett for frend ne foo no langer tyll his lyf ware lorn. when mycol hath þis herd how hyr fader can say, ffull ferdly furth scho ferd to marre yt, yf scho may. 526 “Dauid”, scho sayd, “my husband hende, my fader hath full hertly hyght he sall no[t] fyne for fo ne frend to morn or he hath marde þi my?t. þi way wy?thly behoues the wende and leue me here a wylsom wy?t. For bettur is þou lyfe and lende þen [þat] we both to dede be dy?t.” he assented certayn syghand with sympyll chere. yf þei perteyd with payn, no question is to inquere. 527 Swylke wemen were worthy to wed to helpe þer husbandes in a nede. ffor hyr ded was scho not adred, bot ?it scho dyd an oþer dede. Scho layd a dry stoke in his bed and couert yt with worthy wede. when knyghtes come hym to haue [d]ede, scho sayd, “sers, sen he fro cowrt ?ede, he toke so hertly care; his lyf days ar nere done.” þei wened well yt so ware; agayn þei we[nt] full sone. 528 And euyn os þei in sy?t com see, vnto the kyng so con þei say. he bad be lyue, “bryng hym to me; he sall dee with dole þis day!” þei saw yt my?t no bettur be; vnto his hows agayn go þei. In his bed þe fand a mekyll tree hyld, and he was went a way. when þe kyng saw he was hale, hys hert had sorow enogh. 529 he sware his doyghtur suld be schent; full he leued to lose his land. To ramatha is Dauid went, wher samuel is soiorand. he told to hym all his entent, how [þat] the kyng so fellows fand, Bot þat he so þe lyfe was lent. both loued þei god with hert and hand. he sayd, “sun, for this thyng in hert haue þou no toy?t. god will þat þou be kyng when all his whylys ar wroy?t.” 530 Aftur þis ware long to tell how euer þe [kyng] hys k[i]nd[e]s kyd. ffor messeg made he mony a mell; to be his bayne ay can he byd. when Ionatas herd how þat yt fell, grett heuenes in hert he hyde. ffor dowt of dede [þat con hym quell] [he wold bot wytt] how Dauid dyde. Ry?t vnto ramatha he went þe gaynest gatte. The trew lufe be twen þem two my?t no bale gare abate. 531 when Dauid herd say for certayn þat Ionatas wold com hym tyll, fful gladly went he hym agayn and thanked hym oft of all gud wyll. Of his frenschepe he was full fayn, for he lufed lely lowd and styll. he told hym all þe procese playn how þe kyng aspyd hym to spyll. To fotte can Dauid fall for his god wyll a[ll] way. Ionatas says he sall helpe all þat he may. 532 “[To] The kyng, my fader, wyll I fare and faynd his frenschepe forto geyte. ffor þe to speke I sall not spare, all þof he wold me bynd or bete. At erst þat I her answer of lastand luf or like to thrett, þat þou may kepe þi self fro care, þou sall be wernd, or euer I ette.” Dauid says, “for mercy, þou mendes all my myschefe.” þei kyssed full curtasly, and so þei toke þer leue. 533 Ionatas went with sympyll chere. vnto þe cowrt he come in hye when grett fest was of folke in fere. vnto his fader he sayd sothly, “ser, Dauid þat is to yow so dere and in his Dedes ys ay doghty, how ys yt so he is not here? he my?t menske all þis mangery. he is your sun by law and my broþer also. Be oght þat euer I knaw, he trespast neuer yow to. 534 he is ay redy in your ry?t agayn your rebels forto ryse; Phylysteyns hath he feld with fy?t and owtrayd all our enmyse. In cowrt is non so cumly kny?t, ne non so wyse, yf he vs avyse.” The kyng þen loked on hym full ly?t and sayd, “lossell fowle, þou lyse. þat sall ?e both aby[e], als sone os I hym see. þou maynteyns with maystry þe most enmy to me.” 535 Ionatas answerd with word hende: “ser, yt hath not so bene sene; ?e haue fun your faythfull frend; to your bedyng bown hath he bene.” þen wex þe kyng full of þe fend; he wared fast with word kene. hys sun he schope forto schend, yf wyght men had not gone be twene. Ionatas wyst well enogh þen how þe game wold go. Of dregh he hym with drogh and fled his fader fro. 536 To Dauid wyghtly is he went, wher he was in grett stody sted, And sayd how he suld haue bene schent be for his fader, had he not fled, And how no mercy my?t be ment, ne specialty may none be sped. “þer is no oþer tale to tent bot wend or wage þi hede in wed.” To his fette þen Dauid fell and thanked hym of all thyng. luf þat was þem o mell made payn at þer pertyng. 537 Dauid sayd, “ser, yt is so, for souerayn god þus he be soght! All yf þi fader wyll be my foo, be þou my frend and fayle me noy?t!” Ionatas sayd, “for well or wo, what warke in ward with me be wroy?t, þe cunnand made be twyx vs two, þat sall I hald with hert and toy?t.” þei durst no langer dwell, for folke ware not þer frend. þei kyssed and morned omell, and so þer way þei wend. 538 Ionatas went with sympyll chere agayn vnto þat same Cety, And dauid soyght with sorow sere vntyll a town, was named Nobbe. þor wuned a byschope of grett power, Abymalec at home hegh he. he welcumd Dauid os his dere and asked hym aftur his mene?e. he sayd, “ser, I am sent in messege fro þe kyng. My mene?e furth ar wentt for oþer nedfull thyng. 539 Myn armour gart þei me for gete. yf þou haue any, helpe me!” he says. “And als yf þou haue oght at ette, for sene I ette, ar gone thre days. And ser, I haue meystur of mette, for I haue to wend wylsom ways.” The byschope says, “I haue of whette blessyd bred þat is to prays. Bot Armour none I bere, ne wapyns with to fy?t Bot a gud sword of were; þat sall be þin be ry?t.” 540 he cald hym kyndly, as he can, with mette and drynke and myrthis more. Golias sword he gaf hym þe[n] qwylke hym selfe wan in feld be fore. In þis meyn tyme com in a man, Odeth, þat keped þe kynges st[o]re. he wyst not how Debate be gan, ne of þe kyng how wroth þei ware; Bot þat he fore can see, and talken þem betwen, In hert well haldes hee, for so was aftur sene. 541 þen Dauid furth his frendes soght; he fand bot few in to affy. In certayn soiorne wold he noy?t: þat folke by spech my?t hym aspy. ffull mony wonder werke he wroy?t, als he com in sere cumpany. And how all was to endyng broy?t, þe bybyll bers wyttenese þerby. yt ware long tyme to tell how [he] hys cowrse kest And what ferlys be fell or he was broy?t to rest. 542 Bot poyntes þat falys to our procese, sum of þis werke we wyll be gyne: how þat he wund in wyldernese, in a forest þat heygh sephyn. þore come men to hym, more and lesse, of cosyns and of oþer kyn. And þos þat owtlayd or exyld ys, þos went to hym, all þat my?t wyne. þei bede hym forto be his men [in all] manere. So in schort tyme had he fawre hunderth folke in fere. 543 Now in þis meyn tyme herd þei tell with folke þat ferd þore to and fray how the phylysteyns, fers and fell, in seged a cyte þat heght Ceilay, And how þei made maystrays o mell and sayd þat þei suld bryn and slay Ebrews þat in þat Cete dwell and all þer thresour to þem ta. þei brynt and wold not blyn a bowt both lengh and brede. þen þei þat ware with in lyfed in grett dole and drede. 544 Qwen Dauid wyst þei suld be slayn [he] wrscheped god with wyll and toy?t. þen vnto god fast can he frayn whedder he suld helpe þem and he moght. And sone he had answer agayn and sayd, “[g]o furth and drede þe noy?t!” To geydder his folke he was full fayn, and vnt[o] cyala sene þei soy?t. þor was no tale of trewse; phylysteyns fast þei feld. And þei resaued þe Ebrews þat in þat Cyte dwelled. 545 þe souerance of þat same Cyte honerd Dauid with hert and hende And bed at his bedyng to be and at his wyll to wun and wende. In þat Cyte þen soiornde he, and in grett lykyng þor þei lend So þat hym self and his mene?e with mette and drynke ware mekyll amend. þore gatt þei gold gud wone, armurs and oþer wedys. Sum þat be fore had none hose now all þat þem nedes. 546 word of þis werke full wyd can spryng with lernd and lewd in all þat land. And sone was told to Saull þe kyng how Dauid was so soiornand. he was full fayn of þat tythyng, for þer he hopyd to haue hym at hand And into a bale hym forto bryng, for his strengh my?t no man stand. he sayd, “sone sall we see hys bost proued full prest, when he haldes þat Cete and leuys þe fayre forest.” 547 he purpassed hym full preuely Dauid to schame and [to] schend And ordand with clene cumpany to Ceila sodanly to wend. he sent sere men to spyre and spye how Dauid tytest my?t be tened. bot he had hertyng hastely fro god, þat euer was his frend. God werned hym fast to flee with his men, old and ?yng, And in þe forest to be for þe kynges comyng. 548 ffor yf þe kyng þat Cete crafe or any sawt to yt sett, The Cyteners þem self to sayue sall sone delyuer yt ose dew dett. þen suld Dauid no helpyng haue bot be tane os a fysch in A nett. And sone went both kny?t and knaue to forest, where none wold þem [l]ett, And when þe kyng yt knew þat þei ware past fro playn, No ferther wold he persew bot tytt turned hom agayn. 549 þei toke [to] a wod þat hey?t geden, bot þore þei soiornd bot lytyll whyle; [þen] to a forest þat hey?t Cephyn; þore hoped he non suld hym begyle. þor Ionatas fro all his kyn to see Dauid soy?t mony a myle. he was wel [glad] his wrschepe to wy[n], all yf his fader wold fayn hym fyle. yt was myrth, when þei mett, to wytt how all yt was. þei kyssed and for joy grett, and sone sayd Ionatas, 550 “Dauid”, he says, “drede þe no dele, all yf þe kyng þre[pe aga]in the, For aftur wo all sall be well: þou sall gouernd [in] grett degree. I am [þ]in freynd; þat sall þou fele: þer sall not fawt be fun in me. To sayue þi self seke þi sele; yt is the fayrest forto flee. þou sal be kyng be kynd and full grett lordschepe lede. Make me þen in mynd and thynke on ayre don dede. 551 yt is wysdom, os wysmen says, at suffer welth forto wyn. And in no poynt he is to prays þat can not byde his bale to blyn. All yf þe kyng þe wayte all ways, he sall not dere for all his dyn. þou sall endure aftur his days and stand in state þat he standes in.” þus bad he hym to beld and sayd he suld be kyng. Dauid curtasly kneled and thanked hym of all thyng. 552 þen perted þei, yf yt ware payn, for full trew luf was þem be twen. And Ionatas went home agayn so þat non wyst whore he had bene. And Dauid held his peyse full playn in wodes, for he suld noy?t be sene. And euer he has in vncertayn whore he my?t dwell with owtyn tene. he durst not dwell for Dyn in town, ne in Cyte. In the forest of Cephyn ay toy?t hym best to be. 553 All in desert so con þei dwell; of ryall ryches noy?t þei reke. þei dranke no wyn bot of þe well, ne beyre bot of þe reynnand beke. In þis meyn tym is so to tell how þe kyng in yre was euer freke And of falshed þat þen be fell thrugh Odeth to Abymaleke. þe kyng for Dauid spyred forto bryng hym in bale. Odeth his mayster herd, stert vp and told þis tale. 554 “Syr kyng,” he sayd, “I meruell me þat þou for Dauid hath any drede. I saw hym in þin awn Cete, wher þi frendes fayre con hym fede. Abymalec, byschope of Nobbe, full mekyll beld con to hym be[de]. Golias sword to hym toke he and kyssed hym kyndly when he ?ede. I wened noy?t ?e ware wroth, and sertes, ser, had I wyst, I suld haue bun þem both and led þem to your lyst. 555 And ser, to proue þis þat I say, sendes for þat popelard preuely.” The kyng þer in [made] no Delay; full herdy men he sentt in hy. þe byschop broy?t þei þe same day with his kynred in cumpany. The kyng hym asked in rude aray why he mayntened his most enmy. Abymalec hym excused be wytty wordes all ways. hys resons ware refused, bot softly þus he says, 556 “Syr kyng, þou may full wynly wake whyll luf lastes be twyx yow t[wo]. Me toy?t full well sett for þi sake all þe eys þat I my?t to hym do. he sayd he suld þi messege make, And for he suld more sewrly go, Golias sword I cowd hym take, qwylke hym self wan in feld in [w]o. he standes in mony a stowre and ys euer bown to wende fforto sayue þin honowre. þerfor, ser, he is þi frend.” 557 þen was þe kyng wode, I warrand, when he of all þis werkyng wyst. hys kenyst knyghtes þen he cum[m]and to kyll hym þat hys enmys kyst. Bot non on hym wold lay þer hand be cause he was goddes byschop blyst, Owtakyn Odeth, þat fawtt fyrst fand; to werke wo þat was [hys] lyst. hys sword full swyth he droghe with oþer of his assent. The byschope þer he sloygh with all his clene couent. 558 he wold noy?t stynt so forto stryfe with all þat come þat close within, So þat þei slogh fowr score and fyue of þe byschop clerkes, or euer þei blyn. þen bad he þem wend be lyue þe burgh of Nobbe forto bryn, And þat þei suld stroye chyld and wyue to þe ott[er]est end of all his kyn. þei wasted all þat þore wore þat non away was wun, Owtake Abyathar, Abymalec eldyst sun. 559 yt schope so þat he was not schent; god ordand hym to flee be fore. To Dauid wyghyly is he went and sayd to hym with syghyng sore how all was tan with turnament, his fader and his clerkes, IIII score, And how Noabbe with bale was brent and non on lyfe left, lesse ne more. Dauid says oft, “alas þat folke for me ar dede!” Abyathar þen byschop was furth in his fader stede. 560 kyng saul euer by consell cast how þat he my?t best do Dauid dere. And full oft sythyes he fowled fast with all his fors hym forto fere. Bot Dauid euer fro perels past, als was goddes wyll hym forto were. And so be fell yt at þe last þat Dauid my?t haue done hym dere. And how þat tym be tyd, we wyll take t[i]me to tell, Both of dedes þat þei dyd and what wordes wore þem omell. 561 The kyng full ray[the]ly can ryd Dauid to wast for werldes wele. And Dauid durst not well abyd; so ware þe kynges folke ferly fele. Vnder A hyll he con hym hyde in a depe hole to hald his hele So þat þe kyng suld passe be syd, and noþer suld with oþer dele. Bo[t] or þei past þat pase, euyn bot þem two be twen Be fell a ferly case, os þen þe soth was sene. 562 The kyng sone of the hole had a sy?t þat yt was merke and owt of mynd. Down of his palfray con he ly?t to eyse his womb be way of kynd. And als he in his ded was dy?t, Dauid folke soyn con hym fynd. þei sayd, “ser, go ryue throwgh hym ry?t; oft hath he [þe] persewed and pynd.” Dauid says, “god forbede! he is A kyng enoynt.” Bot or euer þei ?ede, he playd a perlus poyntt. 563 ffull preuely his space he spyde; of þe kynges cloy?t A peyse he kytt. The kyng þen reded hym to ryde, and als he was bown furth to flytt, Dauid curtasly þus cryed, “ser kyng, to wend þus ys no wytt. I my?t haue made þe here to byde. be hald þi mantyll and yt ys slytt! When I þis fro þe reued away, and þou not wyst, I my?t haue hade þi hede als lyghtly, yf me lyst. 564 And þerfor, ser, persew me noy?t; I am not glad þe forto greue, Bot bown in all þat euer I moght þe and þi reme forto releue.” þe kyng þen herd and hym be toy?t how he was þore in grett myscheue, And how wysly þore Dauid wroy?t; no more in malyce wold he meue. he trowd be þis tokenyng with in hym selfe alsone þat Dauid suld be kyng when he had his dedes done. 565 he saw Dauid was well Arayd with feyghyng folke full fayre in fere And toy?t, yf he to batell brayde, who so suld wyn wrschepe wore in were. þerfor all sothly þus he sayd, “Dauid, þis ded þou hath done here And þi grett meknese made me payde; I grawntt þe peyse be my powere. Sen þou so sufferand ys, þi lordschep lang wyll last. I grawnnt þe forgyfnes of all poyntes þat ar past, 566 So þat þou faythfully sall fulfyll þe forward fest be twyx vs two, And þat þou do gode and non yll to my folke when I found þem fro.” Dauid sayd, “ser, with gud wyll, als þou wyll say, so wyll I do.” þe kyng þen cald hys folk hym tyll; to galgala agayn can þei go. And Dauid wentt [þen hyne] with his men euer ychon To þe forest of Cephyn; he wyst no bettur wone. 567 In þis meyn tyme þat I of tell Dyuerse farles con befall. The nobyll prophett samuell þen dyed, as erthly men bus all. þen Dauid men meued þem omell, for fude in forest fand þei small. And þore be syde Cephyn con dwell a full ryche man, his name Noball. he had ryches by raw of rent and ryalte, Bot he lyfed not by þe law of moyses and Iosue. 568 No man cowd rekyn hys ryches ryfe; he was ryall in his aray. Bot euer he was with sturt and stryfe þat no man my?t hym [d]o his pay. A gud woman hade he to wyfe, and hyr name was cald Abygay. Scho wrschept god in all hyr lyfe and at hyr my?t mayntened his lay. Scho was full trest and trew and lufed with more and lesse And fayr of hyd and hew, Als þe boke beyrs wytnese. 569 his catell was in sesyn sett als ouer all in þat cuntre. Dauid oft with hyrdes mett and mayntend þem als his mene?e. Wyld wulfes and lyons oft he lett to do dysese to Naball fee. All yf his fod was ferre to fett, no thyng vnto rewll take wold hee. So ose þe ?ere con slype, þe seson fell þerfor þat men þer schepe suld clype, and þis was costom þore. 570 And so be tyde yt in þat tyd þat Naball hath his fest ordand. [In] All þe cuntre was yt cryd, os costom was in þat land; ffast vnder þat ylke forest syde swylke solace suld be so nere hand. he made wyght men to wende at muster þer myschefe And pray Naball to send sum fude for þer releue. 571 Then of þe wyghest furth ar wentt to Naball, whore play was plente. when þei had told all þer entent, dyspytusly answerd þen hee, “wh[o] is he þat þus yow hath sent?” þei sayd, “Dauid, þe sun of Iesse.” he sayd þei suld be schamed and schent as felons þat ar fayn to flee. “he is þe kynges enmy and hath full wekydly wroy?t. all hys fors I dyfye; here sall he haue ry?t noy?t.” 572 þe messyngers agayn þei goo and told Dauid euere ylk a dele. When he yt wyst, he was full wo and sayd yt suld be venged well. hee sware grett othes þat he suld slo Naball for all his hertly sele. And aftur hym all oþer mo þat to hym fell suld angers fele; Both man and wyfe and chyld, he sayd þei suld be lorn. And bestes, tame and wyld, no thyng suld be for born, 573 þat þei ne suld passe by sword or knyfe in what syd so þat þei my?t be sene. Sone [aftur] raked þer resons ryfe amang þe hyrdmen all be dene. þei went and told to Naball wyfe þat wytty was with owtyn wene how þat hyr lord suld lose his lyfe, for he [had] carped wordes kene And myssayd Dauid men þat folke ware fayn to plese. ffro scho his cawse cowd kene, hyr hert was not at esse. 574 Scho menys to mend yt, yf scho may, þat þei suld not be putt to pyne. In gud garmentes scho made hyr gay with pe[l]ure and with pyrre fyne. And grett present[es] sch[o] con puruay of bred, flesch and nobyll wyne And wentt to mete hym on þe way towerd þe forest of Cephyn. So leued scho forto lett þe harmes he can þem hette. And sone when scho hym mett, scho fell down to his fette. 575 “A, gentyll knyght of Iesse kynd, þat sal be kyng be reson ry?t, gayre not þe pure pepyll be pyned in dyuerse place for a man plyght. My lord is maysed and owt of mynd; anentes hym self hath he no myght. God for bed þat þe folke suld fynd þi felnes with a foyle to fyght! I wyst not þi men wore to aske vs oght of our gude. Sertes, ser, had I bene þore, þei suld haue faled no [f]ud. 576 And þerfor, ser kny?t, no ferrer kare bot take of me þis pure present.” þen Dauid saw scho was full fayre; grett fauour in hyr face he fand. he sayd, “Dame, be not in dyspayre. I graunt þe, he to þi husband. Non of þi pepyll sall we payre.” scho thanked hym with hert and hand. þei toke mett and drynke; þer of þe folke ware fayn. he thankes hyr, als hym thynke, and so he turnys agayn. 577 Abygay told hyr husband hale what sorows he suld full sone haue sene And sufferd dede in his awn sale, had not hyr witt and werkyng bene. And when he herd hyr tell þis tale, vnto his hert he toke slyke teyne, with in ten days he dyed with bale. few of his mene?e can hym meyne. To Dauid sone was sayd þat Naball endyd so. þen was he ry?t well payd þat he helped not þerto. 578 when Naball þus with wo was went and dede with outyn darte or knyfe, ffor Abygay hath Dauid sent and weded hyr vnto his wyfe. This woman þus turned euyll entent and helped to stynt full mekyll stryfe. And þerfor god slyke grace hath sent in lykyng forto lede hyr lyfe. An oþer he wan also thrugh dughty dedes he dyde. þore had he wyfys two, and Micoll was the thryd. 579 þen folke of cephyn had grett enuy, for Dauid soiornd þor so lang. To saull sent þei preuely and bad þat he suld make hym strang, ffor Dauid þat was his enmy suld not be mayntened þem a mang. þei hete he sall haue hym in hy, for with hym gudly wyll þei gang. when saul herd þis tale folke ware not Dauid frendes, his ost he ordand hale, and wyghtly ydder he wendes. 580 when Dauid herd muster omell kyng saul in þat reme can ryde, he sent his folke by fyrth and fell whore he wold buske to abyd. And sone con þei to hym tythynges tell he soiornde by a cyte syde, And þat þei dy?t þem þore to dwell and telled þer tentes apon þat tyde. Dauid hymself hath soyght tyll he of þem had sy?t, ffor in his hert he toy?t to be nere þem þat ny?t. 581 Two felows þat he trew had fun chesed he furth for sych a chare: On Abysay, his systur sun, and a bold man Abyathar. þoo three þe[r] gatte so hath be gun, and any wyght of þem was warre þat to þe kynges tent ar þei wun, wher he lay and þe Duke Abnare. All folke war fast on slepe aftur þe mydny?t tyde. þor was no cowrs to kepe; þei ware s[ure] on ylka syd. 582 Dauid þat euer was myld of mode sees how sadly þei slepand are. All yf þei aspyde to spyll his blud, vnto þem wold he do no dere. bot a grett coupe of gold full gud and als þe kynges chefe chasyng spere þei toke, and euyn agayn þei ?ode, and ouer a burn þei con þem bere. And [on] þat oþer syd, whore þ[ei] no harme my?t take, Dauid full kenly cryd, “wake, ser abnere, [w]ake! 583 ?e werke, os ?e ware chylder ?eng, þat kepes a kyng and slepis so sade Qwyls men beyre away his thyng.” þe duke of hym þe he[r]yng hade And answerd hym os in hethyng, “why cryes þou so, vnknawn lade, And makes swylke noyse þus nere þe kyng?” þen saul wakynd and was rad. he trowed sum ware vntrew of þo þat wuned hym wyth, ffor þe voyce well he knew þat yt was of Dauid. 584 And to wytt how yt was [begun], he cryde to hym and cald be name, “Is þou not Dauid, Iesse sun?” “?is sertes,” he sayd, “I am þe same. þis ylke ny?t my?t [þou me] haue [fun] In þi tent, wher þou haldes þi hame. yow both I my?t haue bett and bun and went my way with owtyn blame.

The cowpe and þe spere he sent agayn. ylkon at wyll þen [went] þer way. The kyng abatyd his breth and toy?t his werke not wyse; And Dauid went to geth, vnto [þe] kyng Achyse. 587 þe kyng Achyse þat I of meyne was wyght enoght and wyse of were, bott he was full [a] phylysteyn and his men in þe same manere. he hard well how Dauid had bene be fore abowt to do þem dere. Bot now he wott with outyn we[n]e kyng saul and he enmys ere. All yf he ware Ebrew, sen þ[ei] his Enmys wore, he trowde he suld be trew to phylysteyns þerfore. 588 he gaf hym landes a lytill fra to loge hym and his pepyll in, A grett Cete, Cissylla, to hym and to hayrys of his kene. ydder went he and his wyfes two, and þer þei wuned with mekyll wyn, VI hunderth men with outyn [w]o owt of the forest of Cephyn. Semly þore soiournde þei, Dauid and his Ebrews. he honerd god all way and fayged þe [cananews]. 589 To brew þem bale bown wold he be. ouer mownt he went to Malachis, And þore he stroyd vp þat cuntre, and sythyn he wentt vnto serrys. þer gatte þei gold full grett plente, pellour and pyrry of grett pryse. And grett presandes oft sythyes sent he vnto þe kyng of geth, Achys. Achys noy?t vnderstud what phylesteyns can fele. Dauid sayd he gatt þat gud of Ebrews ylka dele. 590 þen was kyng Achis ferly fayn þat he and Ebrews enmys ware. he trowd he wold neuer turne agayn so frenly als he was be fore. he sembyld [men] with all his mayn of all his landes, both lesse and more, And sayd þe Ebrews suld be slayn, and on lyfe suld he leue no store. he prayd Dauid als frend þat he and his mene?e with hym in were wold wend, and gladly grawnthed he. 591 þen was full grett myrth þem o mell; þei styrd and wold no langer stand, Bot furth þei [fare] ouer fyrth and fell and fullyd all þat þei be fore fand. when kyng saul herd tythynges tell þat phylysteyns enturd his land, he sayd þei suld not so[und]ly dwell. a full grett ost sone he ordand. A[nd] with þem all went he with mekyll prese and pryde To þe mount of gylboy, and þore he busked hym to byd. 592 he my?t se on þat hyll on heyght in þe low land what lyfe þei led: Towns of fyre byrnand full bry?t and all ouer was with enmys spred. he saw þem mony and mekyll of my?t; sum dele in hert he was a dred And prayd to god to schew sum sy?t how þat he suld in þat stowre be sted, whedder his folke suld be flayd or ellys þer enmys slayn. bot how s[o] euer he prayd, he had no tokyn agayn. 593 his prophett[es] also for hym pray[s]; of h[elpe] vnto hym herd þei noy?t. þen wyst he well þat god not pay[s] sum werkyng þat he has wroght. he bad his men go dyuerse ways þat sum wyche sone to [hym] ware soyght, þat by hyr craft cowd ded men rays þat sum body be lyue ware broy?t To tell how he suld chefe, awder lyfe or ellys be sloyne. One sayd, “lord, with your lefe In Endor dwels swylke one. 594 Scho con by craft of socery tell all þat euer in erthe sal be.” The kyng went to hyr prevely and bed hyr gold, full grett plente, To rayse hym vp sum ded body, to say whedder he suld fyght or fle. Scho aske[d] in whom he wold affy. “In samuel, forsoth”, says hee. Sone thrugh hyr soceris and thrugh þe fendes rede Samuel scho gart vp ryse, þat lang whyle had bene dede. 595 Als samuel stud þem be forne, þe kyng sayd, “tell vs, or we twyn, whedder syd sal be vp born in þis batell þat we be gyne, And who sall haue þer lyuys lorn!” þen answerd he with dedly dyne, “þou and þi suns sall wun to morn in þe same wyse þat I wun In.” þen was he hent in hy a way, þei wyst not whore. kyng saul þen was sory; hym rewed þat he come þore. 596 he teldyd hym with in his tent on gylboy batell for to abyde. Now leue we hym wher he is lent and tell how Dauid con be tyde. kyng aches boldly borows brent and stroyd Cytes on ylka syde. Dauid ay wy[ght]ly with hym went; no[n] was so well arayd þat tyde. þe phylysteyns ware not payd þat he suld with þem wun. ylke on tyll oþer sayd, “ys noy?t þis gesse sun? 597 with kyng saul he ys at hame and of his howshold hath bene lang.” Sum oþer says, “þis is the same þat maydyns made of in þer sang.” “Syr kyng,” þei say, “we ar to blame, and he with vs to batell gang. his awn kyng wyll he kepe from schame and turn to mell hym vs amang. The more þat he [us] shendes, þe more thanke sall he haue. So sall þei bee full frendes. þerfor se vs to saue!” 598 kyng aches saw his folke afrayd; Of Dauid fare þei ware not fayn. þerfor þus to hym he sayd, “I thanke þe, ser, with all my mayn þat þou þus prestly is purved, bot now I pray þe turn agayn And see my reme be ry?t arayd. I grawnnt þe heyre my power playn.” þen Dauid home can fare, all ware yt not his wyll. Bot lang or he com þore, new tythynges com hym tyll. 599 Amalachys we ment of ayre, þat Dauid angerd oft be fore, þei wyst full well how þat þei ware went to were, both lesse and mare. þerfor full fersly con þei fayre to Cesilla, whore his wyfes ware. þor forto sp[oyle] wold þei not spare; þei brent and stroyde vp all þer store. þei toke his wyfes two and home with þem þei lede. And of his mene?e moo wore þor full stratly sted. 600 Dauid was neuer ayre so wo; no wounder yf he wex nere wode when þat he wyst his wyfes two war led away with all þer gud. hys mene?e made mornyng also, be cawse þer wyfes with þem ?ode. þei sayd þei suld neuer ha[m]werd go or þei had schamly sched þer blode. Dauid prayd god to send sum comforth in þat case. he had wernyng to wend and well ouercom his fayse. 601 To fell þem down full fast þei thrett, and furth þei cayred to þat cuntre. On of þo Malachys þei mett þat [for mete] my?t no ferreur flee. To haue his hele Dauid hym hett to tell hym how þe best my?t bee. he sayd, “ser, I sall þe sett whor þou þe malachys may see.” hee wysched þem redy way tyll þei had knawyng clere whore all þer enmys lay, makand full mery chere. 602 þei made þen myrth with all þer mayn and trowed þat n[o] man my?t þem marre. þen Dauid and his folke was fayn and toy?t þat þei suld fownd no ferre. þei pressed to þem in þat playn and so with skelppis þei con þem scarre þat sodanly þore ware þei slayn. full ioyfull all þe ebrews arre. þer wyfes þen þei ta and gold full grett plente. And went to Cecilla; þat was þer awn Cyte. 603 Now at þer lyst we leue þem so with Dauid þat of were was wyse, And telle we of þe hostes two on Gylboy, whore kyng saul lyse. ffull gretly þei to geydder go to se what syde suld wyn þe price. þe phylysteyns ware mony moo þat wer comyn with kyng Achys. ffull boldly þei abyde and bett on with brandes bry?t. And ebrews on þer syde full fersly fandyd to fy?t. 604 To tell how all þat werkyng was, lyne be lyne, full lang yt were. þe Ebrews all þe ouerhand hays fro morn to mydday and more; bot at þe last þei sayd alas for lordes þat leued þer lyfes þore And most for gentyll Ionatas, þat Dauid fand his frend be fore. he had stroyd in þat sted phylysteyns full gud woyne, And sythyn he was ded and his breyþer ylkon. 605 when saul saw þat his sun was gone and chefe of all his cheualry, And how he þore was leued alon and had no beld to byde hym by, well leuer he had forto haue bene sloyn þen lyfe in lawles cumpany. þerfor of his men bad he on putt hym to ded þor preuely So þat he past no ferre with folke of fals lyuyng. þat man wold noy?t hym marre by cause he was his kyng. 606 with his awn sword he con be gyn to styke hym self in þat stound. So com A knaue of kaym kyn; þe kyng sayd, “felow, or þou found, Beyr me thrugh, for no thyng blyn, and take my crown and my be rownde!” þe knaue was glad þat gold to wyn and gaf þe kyng his dedes wounde. þus ended þe fyrst kyng þat euer was of Ebrew, ffor he brake goddes bedyng and was not to hym trew. 607 Swylke cayre behoued cum hym tyll for marterdoms þat he dyd make— Byschopes and prestes both he gart spyll and dekyns als for Dauid sake— And for he wroy?t not goddes wyll þat cumaund hym he suld take wrake Of kyng agag, þat greued hym yll, and to trews he con hym take. þat day ware Ebrews slayn, als samuel sayd be fore. Phylysteyns ware full fayn; mawmentes þei wrschept þe more. 608 Sone on þe morn þei sessyd not ?ett or dede bodes spoled bee. kyng saul hed þei haue of cutt and þe same of his suns all thre. on þer Cete þei haue sett yt þat folke on ylka syd suld see, And for þei wold all þe werld suld wyt of þer Iornay in gylboy. To sere Cytes þei sentt qwerters of lordes be l[a]de To mak yt be on ment þe maystrys þat þei þore made. 609 By cawse kyng saul þus was slayn, phylysteyns made grett sacrafyce. his armurs offerd þei ylkon to Astrott, þer god of price. Sythyn Ebrews with grett hand ar gone to þo Cytes be certan spyse. Both hed[es] and bodes haue þei ton and bered þem in þer best wyse, with grett wrschep all ways, for þei so worthy wore, And made sorowyng seuyn days, als costom þen was þore. 610 When kyng saul [was] went his way, XX ?eres þen regnyd [had] hee. And whyls he lufed god and his lay, he had lykyng by land and see. þer lyfed non ayre aftur his day; þe prophett sayd yt suld so be. The fyrst boke endes in this aray þat tels how kyng[es] come in cuntree. ffor[t]her who lykes to loke how was with dauid done, Seke in the secund boke; þer þei sall see full soyne. Liber Secundus Regum. 611 In the fyrst boke of kynges herd haue we how saul was fyrst crowned kyng, And how he dyed on gylboy with his ost outrayd, old and ?yng. Now in the secund sall we see of Dauid and of his doyng. In Cesilla þen soiornd he, and of þat werke wyst he no thyng Tyll aftur on the thryd day þen come a messynger, And swylke saws con he say þat chaunged all his chere. 612 “Ser”, he sayd, “be mery I rede, for gud thynges sall I tell þe. kyng saul þin enmy is dede; I saw hym sloyn and his suns thre.” þe[n] Dauid hert wex heuy as lede. he sayd, “how wott þou yt suld so be?” he sayd, “[from] Iews in the same sted; þe certan seygns þat sall þou see. hym self he wold haue slayn; so was he stede in nede. And for he had no mayn, he prayd me do þat dede. 613 I wyst yt was his awn desyre; to beyre hym thrugh I was full bownne And haue here þat I haue to hyre, hys bees of gold and his gud crownne. I wott þou sal be lord and syre And rewle þe reme, both [towre and town].” þen dauid loked on hym with yre and sayd, “þou sall haue waryson. he was enoynted kyng, þat þou dyde swylke dyspytte.” withowt more doyng hys hede he dyde of smytt. 614 ffull oft he syghtyd and sayd alas þat euer kyng saul suld ende so, Bot more for gentyll Ionatas. when he yt wyst, þen was he woe, ffor trewer luf in werld ne was þen euer was be twyx þem two. þerfor slyke care in hert he has; ne he wyst in werld what he my?t do. he swouned, als he wold swelt, and weped and wrang his h[e]nd. lang with swylke doyles he delt; no man my?t hym amend. 615 Tyll at the last a Duke hym dy?t to bryng his bale in bettur g[u]yse. he says, “yt is no semly sy?t men forto werke on swylke a wyse. yt is well fayrrer forto fyght and venge vs on our yll enmyse. So suld acord to ylka kny?t; with wepyng sall neuer wrschepe ryse. yt falys wemen of eld to wepe, when þei haue wrang, And knyghtes to fyght in feld þe[r] foys with fors to fang.” 616 þen sayd þei so on ylka syde and cachyd myrth so þem a mell. he trowed þer tayles in þat tyde and prayd to god þat he wold þem tell where hym ware best to beld and byd. And goddes prophett bad hym go dwell In Ebron, a Cety long and wyd, with chosyn chylder of israhel. The kynred of Iuda þor chose hym forto þer kyng All way well or wo to lyfe at his ledyng. 617 Now wex Dauid A man of my?t when he was kyng by comyn crye. The pure and rych he rewled ry?t, aftur þer werkyng was worthy. hys cosyn Ioab, a gentyll knyt, made he chefe of his cheualry And next hym his two breþer, þat hey?t A?aell and aba?ai. Ay þe eldyst of Ebrew held he of þe most counsell, Qwyll all he trest for trew and wold not fayntly fayle. 618 We told be fore and not full ferre how kyng saul was feld [in] feyld. At home was left Duke Abnarre his land and his welth to weld so þat none suld with maystry marre ysboset, saul sun vn weld. he and þat Duke yll angerd arre þat Dauid so was broy?t to beld. þei hard how he was kyng of þe kynred of Iuda; þat toy?t þem herd hethyng and kest be twen þem twa 619 how þei my?t turne all þat entent, and þus þei ordand þem omell: þei sembled all to þer assent þat with saul ware wunt to dwell. þat ysbosett þen haue þei hent and made hym [kyng] of israhel; And forto marre so haue þei ment kyng Dauid and his force to fell. When Ioab herd of þo and of þer purpase playn, he and his breyþer two grathed þem þor a gayn. 620 Duke Ioab hath for Dauid heyght to fey?ht in feld and not to flee. Duke Abnarre says for ysbotsett in batell sall he byde and bee. Bot both þer men, when þei ware mett, ware ebrews and of on cuntree. þerfor to were wyll þei not lett tyll þat þei wytt who sall wyn degre. fful fersly þen þei fy?t. bot to [t]ell at þe last: Abnare was put to flyght, and Ioab fowled fast. 621 And als þei persewede þore, ware mony dede with owtyn drede. Bot A?aell was ay be fore, for þore hade he so wyght a stede. when Abnare saw he sewed so sore and to his hele wold take no hede, he prayd hym to persew no more, and he suld gyf hym gold to mede. þerfor he wold not lett, ne for his spekyng spare. And Abnare on hym sett and thrugh his brest hym bare. 622 when Ioab saw þat sory sy?t: his broþer lyg dede on þe land, þen dyde he all his mayn and my?t to venge his ded with hert and hand. And by þat was yt nere þe ny?t, and no tyme to be traueland. Duke Abanare toke a hyll on hyght and gatt a strengh in forto stand. And þen for peyce he prayd to Ioab and his men. “we werke all wrang”, he sayd, “þat sall ?e derly kene.” 623 “Ioab”, he sayd, “full well I knaw a feller kny?t may no man fynde. with phylysteyns to fyght þe aw and with paynyms þat þei ben pynd. Bot we þat lyf all by a law and all are Ebrews of on kynd ylkon to bryng oþer a Daw, we suld haue god more in our mynd. Both Cosyns and kynred are sembled on ayder syde. þe mo þat þus ar dede, þe more tene sall vs be tyde. 624 I prayd þi broþer of peyce when he persewed me with enuy. Bot for my saws he wold not sesse and fell so thrugh his awn foly. So my?t fall þe same messe þi self to suffur or perchaunce I. þerfor yt is fayrest forto sese, and ylk man kepe his cumpany.” qwen Ioab saw certayn he sayd reson and ry?t, hee turned his men agayn and rested þore þat ny?t. 625 Bot on þe morn þei morwnd omell for folke þat þei fand fallyn in feld. þei beyred þe body of a?aell with all þe wrschep þat þei my?t weld. when kyng Dauid herd how yt fell þat a?ael was schent on feld, his tene in hert no tong my?t tell, for he was [all way] hym to beld. kyng Dauid had in Ebron VI wyfes with hym to go, And sere suns: Absolon, Adony and oþer moo. 626 Sone aftur þis þen fell Debate be twyx ysboset and abnare, ffor he had takyn A leman latt þat with saul be fore con [fare]. he sayd yt fell not for his astate to vse wemen þat with kynges ware. Abnare in hert þen con hym hatt, þat chalenged hym for swylk a chare. he says, “euyn als I broy?t þe folke to wun hym wyth, So sall I sett þer toy?t and turne þem to Dauid.” 627 And sone vnto þe same entent letturs dyde he to wrytyng. And messyngers sone hath he sent vnto Dauid, of Iuda kyng. he told hym holy how he ment vnder his b[un]dom forto bryng All þe Ebrews þat with saul went, fro ysbosett, both old and ?yng. Kyng Dauid was full glade when þei told þis tythyng, And sayd with sembland sade, “he sall haue his askyng.” 628 And forto proue be reson ryfe yf he þis purpasse wold persew, he sayd, “send Mycoll, my fayrest wyfe, þat homly is of hyd and hew. I luf hyr lely as my lyfe sen fyrst þat I þat cumly knew. yf he do þis to stynt all stryfe, þen wyll I trest þat all be trew.” þe messyngers ar wentt to abnare euyn agayn, And Mycoll sone was sent, and Dauid þen was fayn. 629 Abnare þis forward wold fulfyll. full sone he gart to geydder call lordes of þe land, both lowd and styll, þat oght my?t gouern grett or small. he sayd, “sers, tentes vnto my skyll; þe certan soth say yow I sall. I wott well yt is goddes wyll þat Dauid be kyng of ebrews all. þe prophett samuel sayd yt suld so be, And with hym wyll I dwell.” þei say, “ser, so wyll we. 630 with hym to pase ware [w]e prest, had we not bene at þi bydyng.” þen twenty barons of þe best be for kyng Dauid con he bryng. A fyrm sewrty þore þei fest and made hym homage, old and ?yng. so were all þe XII kynredes kest with hym to hold and [h]e þer kyng. Grett fest þan mad he þore by cause of kynredes twelfe, Bot Abnare ay be fore was honerd next hym selfe. 631 when all was wele, þei went þer ways, ylkon to þer awn cuntre. Ioab, þe Duke, was all þer days for errandes fare fro þat Cety. when he come and herd how men says of fest and grett solempnite, þat purpas no thyng to hym pays: þat Abnare suld so neghtbur be. he hoped he suld be nare vnto the kyng all way. þat mater wyll he marre in all þat euer he may. 632 ffyrst he told vnto the kyng, “þat Abanare dose [is] all enuy. he feynys frenschepe for no thyng bot for he wyll þis land aspye how he may best hys ost In bryng so to persew þe preuely. And þou wyll trest to his tellyng, þis land may so be lost þerby.” þe kyng wyst þis was wrang; þe case full well he knew. And sayd, “wher euer he gang, I trow Abnare be trew.” 633 When Ioab wyst þis wold not be, sone hath he soy?t A sotell gyne. ffayr letturs sent he forto se with þe best knyghtes of all his kyn And prayd Abnare þat hast suld he to þe kyng be lyue, for no thyng [bl]yn, And speke with hym in specialte for bourdes þat þei suld be gyn. Abnare full sone assent to werke þe kynges wyll. Wyghtly with þem he went, þat wold sped hym to spyll. 634 þen Ioab con full grathly spye and wentt to feld hym forto kepe. he and his broþer aby?ai welcumd hym with grett wrschepe. In consell þei cald hym in hy, ry?t als þei for his wo wold wepe. Ioab þen spake full specialli and þer with wroy?t hym wowndes depe. þis was a[n] [evyll] corde and wroy?t with weked trayn. Alas þat swylke a lord falsly suld be slayn! 635 So preuely his sword he drogh; þe Duke was dede þore sodanly. kyng Dauid hath full mekyll woght when he herd tell þis trechery. Duke Ioab made his tale full togh and sayd he had encheson why: “My broþer Ay?el he slogh, and þen I my?t no wyn hym by.” Bot als men may suppose, he dyd yt more for drede þe lordschep forto lose þat he had forto lede. 636 The kyng is so with mornyng mett; hym gaynes nowder game ne glee. Vnto þe Duke he dyd his dett: Interyd hym in þat same cyte. þen of þis lesson wyll we let sen of þis bale no bott may be, And say how fell of ysbosett, te kyng of israhel cuntre. when he herd how men sayd þat Duke Abnare was dede And trayturly be trayd, he was full wyll of rede. 637 ffull grett mornyng he mad amang; so dyd all þat þen wore þore. bot his lyfe lasted not aftur lang; swylke falshed was formeld þ[erf]ore. To hym was wroy?t als mekyll wrang as to Abnare or ellys more, be two tyrandes and trayturs strang; of byniamyns both born þei wore, Rocab and baana, as beyrs wyttenese þe boke. þies ware þe trayturs two þat treson vnder toke. 638 ffor none may bettur a man betray þen he in whom his hert [is trist]. so preuey with þe kyng war þei to com [in] and owt at þer lyst. Als he lay slepand on a day in place whore non bot þei yt wyst, his hed þei toke and bare a way full mony myls or þei ware myst. þei wend full well haue done qwen [þei] þis falshed fand. To kyng Dauid full sone þei offerd þat presand. 639 with full grett gladnese þei hym grett and sone rehersed hym þer resown: “ser, here þe hede of kyng ysbosett þat was þi foo in feld and town. Now lyfes þe[re] non [þe] forto lett.” he sayd, “trayturs, full of tresown, haue ?e no mynd how I hym mett þat proferd me kynges saul crown? his hed I gart of schaue, for he dyd þat dyspyte. þe same hyre sall ?e haue.” þer hedes he gart of smytt. 640 Vnto kyng Dauid þan þei draw, lordes of ylka cuntre cleyne. And for þer kyng all þei hym kn[a]w and makes hym homage all be dene. so was he lord of hegh and law þat langed to þe XII kynredes kene. þen loues he god, als he well aw, þat so hath sett hym to be sene. And full grett sacrafyce to god þore con he make, And ylke man on þer wyse dyde þe same for his sake. 641 Sen þat his enmys þen ware ded þat lyfand wold haue done hym dere, And all ware sembled in þat same stede, þe kyng wyll wytt what folke þe are. he gart cownt of ylk kynred all þat ware abyll armys to bere, And þat hade force to fend þar hede and fals phylysteyns forto fere. The kynred of Iuda: VI thowsand and IIII score, þis was nowmer of þa þat ware ay sett be fore. 642 Of þe lyne of leuy, lygh als leuyn, IIII thowsand VII hunderth told.

And hastely he hath þem slayn; þat boldnes gart his gamys be gyn. ffor so he was sett a[s] souerayn of all þe kynges men, more and myn, And most chefe of conselys, whore so þei gang or ryde, And ordenare of batellys to buske or ellys to abyde. 650 Sen þat place was þer best socour, to byd þore ware þei not to blame. þe folke þen namyd yt Dauid towre, and to þis day yt beyrs þat name. so was the kyng sett in honour and ouer all namyd of nobyll fame. Phylesteyns þat war styfe in stowre, in þis tyme þei war mad full tame And flemed fro þat Cyte, and Ebrews þor ordand. þe kyng bad yt suld be chefe Cyte of þat land. 651 þos lordes þen þer leuys hath tane when he was sett as soueran syre. ffor hym to noye þen was þer none bot fals phylysteyns, fell ose fyre.

Bot phylysteyns ware no thyng fayn þat he suld gouera[n]d swylke degre. þei sembled men with all þer mayn to sege ierusalem Cyte. bot os god wold, sone was sum slayn, and sum also ware fayn to flee. þat toy?t þem grett dyspyte; þerfor þei wold not blyne. þei gatt mo folke full tytt and new were con be gyne. 655 þei geydderd full grett cumpany þat Cyte oft sythys to assayle. kyng Dauid wold not feygh for þi or he of god had sum consayle wheþer he suld haue þe vyctory and bettur byd in þat batell. God warnd hym þen full wyttly by a sygne þat he suld not fayle. God bad he suld take tent and on þe euynyng tyd lay his men in buschement vnder A forest syde. 656 “On þe morn þen sall ?e fynd þis tokyn trew þat I yow tell. when þe wod wages with outyn wynd, wend þou þen be lyue; no langer dwell. your enmys sall ?e bette and bynd and make þem flee ouer fyrth and fell. þei sal be lorn þat leuys be hynd, and maystry leue þi men omell.” Os god demed, Dauid dyde. his men sone he arayde. And all to hym be tyd, als god hym self had sayd. 657 when þei to batell bremly breyst, Phylysteyns ware full fayn to flee. þe kyng with his folke foled fast and putt þem down, full grett plente. with þer pursewyt so ar þei past to gessore, þat was þer Cyte. þat þei conquerd and down yt cast and gat gret gud of gold and fee. þei wan þor welth enogh, þat wold to tresour tent. hamward þen þei drogh and stroyd euer as þei wentt. 658 The godes of gold þat þei gat þore, þat ware made for þer mawmentry, kyng Dauid toke þem to tresour and forto menske god allmighty. So fals phylysteyns wasted wore þat þei my?t make no more maystry. kyng Dauid wex ay more and more with wrschep, als he was worthy. god wroy?t for hym all way and made hym mekyll in price. And he honerd god ay with suyt and sacrafyce. 659 þen toke he purpase for to ta in to ierusalem Cyte þe arke of gold fra Gabatha and sett yt vp in grett degre.

Kyng Dauid was full glad þat hym was sent swylke seyle; Gud hope in hert he hade þat god dyd euer ylk dele. 662 And be cause he swylke wrschep wan and gat to gouern swylke degre, To honer god, yf þat he can, in all his my?t ymagyns hee. he told to þe prophett nathan þat he wold make of ston and tree A chyrch þat was cald tempyls þen whore in þe arke of god my?t be, þat folke may call and knell to be assoiled of þer syn. þo prophett prayssed hym well swylke gud werke to be gyn. 663 bot aftur, o[s] I vnderst[ode], god cald vnto hym on A ny?t, “Dauid, my seruand myld of mode, A howse to me sall þou non dy?t, By cause þi handes ar full of blod of þos þat þou hath feld in fy?t.

And aftur þe þin hayre, þat sal be salamon, he sall make well and fayre my howse of tree and ston.” 664 The prophett sayd þe kyng certayn, als god had told hym vnder teld. þen was kyng Dauid ferly fayn þat his heyre suld his welthis weld. he honerd god with all his mayn þat hym had broy?t vnto swylke beld And mad hym kyng with power playn fro hyrd þat keped fee in feld. he gouernd al[d] and ?yng all way by consell clere; so lyfyd he in lykyng in myrth full mony a ?ere. 665 Kyng Dauid both be nyght and days full dewly demys of ylka dede. ffor on poynt was he worthy to prayse: þat he wold herkyn and take hede In ry?t and reuerence þem to arase þat helped hym when he had nede. ffor Ionatas waytt he all ways yf any sewtt ware of his sede, ffor whyls he lyfed in land, his luf my?t no thyng lett.

And to þe ?yng kyng haue þei told þer resons all; þei rehershed ry?t how kyng Dauid had sayd his frenschepe suld not faylle. þe princes ware not payd and cald þe kyng in consayle. 669 þei say, “ser, be ware and wytty; þis is the falshed of þi foo. þies lordans comys þi land to spy and wayte how þei may werke þe wo. þerfor ser, sett no thyng þer by, bot sen þou sees þat yt is so, lett vs waytt þem sum velany and send þem furth wher þei com fro.” þe kyng was ?yng of eld, þat was sone aftur sene. he lost his bygest beld, and so yt turned to tene. 670 be þis consell þe kynges mene?e þis messyngers both bett and band And cutt þer cloghes vp at the the, als foles wer serue[d] in þat land; Sythyn mad þer berdes half chauyn be and þe oþer half styll to stand And send þem so to þer cuntre and bad þei suld go tell thythand. yf kyng David for þis be wroth, no wonnder yt ys, To see so mekyll of mys agayns his grett gudnes. 671 he bad þem venge þis velany þat vnder hym had his power. Ioab, his steward stalworthy, sayd yt suld be boy?t full dere. And his broþer abbysay sembled folk from sydes sere Anon, þe kyng of amonys, and his cuntre forto conquere. when kyng anon herd say of Ioab entent þat tyd, his folke he gart aray in batell hym to abyd. 672 Duke Ioab furth his folke he led vnto þei come in amonys cuntre. he stroyd and brent all þat was bred and nawder spared folke ne fee. And als sone os þei batell bed to loke who suld þe bettur bee, Phylysteyns full fast þei fled and toke [to] Rabatt, þare ryche Cyte. þat Cyte was so strong with guns and oþer geyre. ffro þei þat force my?t fang, þei dowtt no dedes of were. 673 Duke Ioab dy?t hym forto dwell and wyn þat Cyte, yf he my?t. And in þis meyn tyme þat I tell, kyn[g] Dauid rewled hym all vnry?t. In awowtry fowle he fell with vry wyf, þat [was] his kny?t. Swylke medyturs was mad o mell þat with hym was scho all ny?t.

Syr vrre sett he in swylke place whore he wyst þei suld do hym dere. And sone a way fro hym he gays. þen þei with in were wyse of were And sees þat he no help hays; thrugh þe body þei con hym bere. þus was he saklese slayn, þat shaply vnder scheld. þe kyng þerfor was fayn his wyf þat he my?t weld. 680 he wedyd hyr with mekyll wyn and mad hyr to be crowned qwene All fort[o] couer þat cursyd syn þat þei had done þem two be twen, ffor þe grett state god sett hym in mad hym kyng with crown clene. To greyue hym þus he con be gyne, and þat was on hym selfe sene. God toke not sone vengiance, bot fyrst he wyll assay yf he with repentance wyll mend whyls he may. 681 The prophett natan sone he sent to ierusalem, þat ryche Cyte. Als god wold, wyghly he wentt both to kyng Dauid and barsabe. “ser kyng”, he says, “sen god hath lentt þat þou sall deme in ylke degre, A thyng þat falys to þi jugment am I comyn forto aske of þe.

Now gate he an othre of Barsabee, and he was named Salamon, As wyse a man in his degree as euer god layd life vpon. As Absalon was fair, so was Salamon wyse And after his fadir hair and kyng pereles of price.] 690 In all þis tyme Duke Ioab lay þe Cyte of rabaat forto wyn. ffor fawt of fode þei fell down fay, Phylysteyns þat ware with in. When Duke Ioab saw certayn day þat [þei] þare fro suld nedly twyn, hee sent [to] kyng Dauid forto say [þat himself] suld com and be gyn. heyrof well payd was he, and ydder he wendes on one. þei wan sun þat Cyte and gatt þer welth grett wone. 691 Anon, þe kyng of amonys, was þore owtrad and al to shent. his crown þat was of grett price kyng Dauid has on his hed hen[t]. The lordschepes þat abowt hym lyse and burghes brode be lyue ware brent. And when all was wrogh on þis wyse, to ierusalem with ioy þei wentt. þe kyng made all men glade with grett gyftes or þei gang. grett ioy in hert he had, bot yt last not lang. 692 he had A doyghtur his hert was on, heygh Thamar, o[s] I told be for[n]e.

[So] Thamar was comyn on a day hyr broþer frendly [for] to fede. þen wysed he all his men away and bad þem spere all as þei ?ede. And to his systur con he say, “My ded ys dy?t with outyn dred.

Sone Absolon sayd vnto his hyne how Amon had done hym dyspytt, “When ?e se hym well dronkyn of wyne, his hed þen smertly ?e of smytt. ffor he mysded to me and myne, now sall I fand yt forto qwytt.” þei dyd als he commawnd, and sone was Amon slayn. so for fowle luf in land ar men oft put to payn. 703 his breþer, when þei saw þis sy?t, and all his frendes ware fowle afrayd. To ierusalem þei went full wy?t and told how Amon was be trayd. kyng Dauid, qwen þis D[ol]e was dy?t, “al[a]s, both ware my suns”, he sayd, “bot Absolon by reson ry?t sall dere aby þis byttur brayd.” he mornyd and mad grett mone for both þoo breþer sake. so dyd his frendes ylkon and wered weked wr[a]ke. 704 þen Absolon was fayn to fle and soiornnd for certan tyde In Iessor with þe kyng of Cirre, his syb man on his moyder syde. And þore he bod by ?eres thre his fader frenschep to abyd. þen Ioab toy?t asay wold he to make acord all harmys to hyd. he soyght A sotell gyn and ordand of þis thyng: A woman suld be gyn forto carpe with þe kyng. 705 he gart A lady go and grette and ryue hyr hare full rewfully. scho fell before þe kynges fette, and mercy lord lowd con scho cry. he sayd, “my help heyr I þe hette, tell vnto me þi harmys in hy.”— “A mercy lord, my bale þou bete, for dred of þi law lorn am I.

So was þo plenyng past for þe ded of Amon. 709 Of Absolon is ferly fare to fynd how fayr he was to [s]y?t, And of his makyng mekyll mare; he past all oþer men in my?t. Of XX libri wegh was his hare þat he had on his hed on heyght. And als clerkes con yt declare, like to gold wyre so was it bryght. To no maystrys he meued whyls men dyd his desyre. bot and he ware oght greued, þen was he fell o[s] fyre. 710 he hath geydderd of gold and fee for hym and mony oþer moo, And þerof gafe he grett plente and mad þem frendes þat ware his foo, þat souerance of þat same Cyte and oþer Cetys sere also. And þe most of þe kynges mene?e ware wylly with hym forto go. So be IIII ?eres ware past, he had so wysly wroght: All folke ware with hym fast and to his socour soght. 711 So when he wyst both old and ?yng wold holly a[t] his ledyng lende, he asked leue at his lord þe kyng vnto Ebron forto wende his sacrafyce þor forto bryng, als he had hey?t with hert and hende. The kyng sayd, “sun in my blessyng.” bot of his cast no thyng he kend. Of charys and chyualry grett plente war purvayde, And furth he wendes in hy tyll Ebron, als he sayd. 712 Cytes and towns, when þei herd tell þat absolon so was assent, At home þem lyst no langer dwell, bot with hym holy ar þei went. And meruell had þei þem omell what thyng he had in his entent. bot his cheue counsell, archyttofell, þer wyst no mo men what he ment. when he come in Ebron, whor hym lyked best to be, he gart þo men ylkon to hym self make sewrte. 713 þei ware full bown to his bedyng, both kny?t, swyer, [knaue] and page. þei honerd hym ouer all thyng and sett hym vp in certan stage. þen all þe cuntre, old and ?yng, com to hym and made homage And hey?t to hald hym for þer kyng and werke his wyll with outyn wage. When all ware same assent and mad seurty certayn, þen told he his entent and all his purpase playn. 714 “sers”, he sayd, “sene ?e deme me to be kyng and were þe crown, your land and yow well sall I ?eme and maynten yow in all reson. my fader ys fayrest forto fleme, or yf he byde, to bryng hym down.” þei say, “ser, sertes so wyll yt seme; to make þis bargan ar we bown.” þis was a curssed cum[m]and his fader so to spyll. And ?ett feyll foyles he fand þat falshed to fulfyll. 715 þen kyng Dauid herd tythyng tell þat his awn sun with sytt hym soght, And how þat fals archytofell, his counsellar, was [with] hym broy?t. he ordand sone his men o mell to remeue in all þat þei moght. he sayd, “we be ded and we dwell; I knaw so wele þer wekyd toy?t. And yf þei here vs t[o]ke or sege[d] þis Cete, þen war ouer latte to loke to qwylke syd we suld flee.” 716 he bad þe byschop abyathar and his wyfes with drere mode And oþer clerkes þat with þem ware in þer sere state als þei stude To dwell þer styll for any care, to kepe þe arke of god full gud, And send hym word ay how þei fare vnto þe flome or be yond þe flode. Ten wyfes with oþer frendes þor leues he soiorand so. And furth þen with hym wendes sex hunderth and no moo. 717 Als he went apon A heght hyll, he saw þe Cyte and burghis by, qwylke he was wunt at weld at wyll and was dyssauyd fro sodanly. þen loued he god with steuyn full styll and sayd, “þis wo am I worthy.” So come A man mornand hym tyll, þat Cosyn was and heyght Cusy. kyng Dauid sayd, “I trest to þe þat þou be trew. ffull fayn I wold þou frayst yf þat þou may remewe 718 Archytofell, þat fals is ay, oute of þe counsell of my sun. he is abowt both ny?t and day to werke þat we in bale ware bun.” þen Cusy says, “I sall asay, for all þis falshed hath he fun.” And [with] þis word he went his way to þe Cete ward, as he was wun. This mater sal be ment more furth, als yt be fell; bot how Kyng Dauid went, is fyrst now forto tell. 719 Sone on þe morn with Dauid mett fro þe same Cyte on Cyba, was stewerd to Mifbosett, þat was the sun of Ionatha. both bred and wyn furth has he fett, a presand to þat pepyll [and] ma. Dauid asked sone, when þei ware sett, “how farys our frend þat þou com fra?” he says, “ser, sen þou went, he is a bowt to bryng sere folke to his assent And says he wyll be kyng.” 720 Kyng Dauid says, “sertes, þat ware schame; þou wott well he may do no dede. ffor he is lytyll, and he is lame and no thyng lyke a land to lede. Me thynke þat boy is forto blame; þerfor sone sall I spyll his spede. Syba, þou sall haue þat same þat I gaf hym when he had nede.” þen Syba went agayn; in hert he was full glade And toke all power playn þat Myfbosett hade. 721 Kyng Dauid cowd no comforth ken bot cayred furth with his cumpany. A grett mysdoer mett hym þen, kyng saul cosyn Se[m]ey. he werred Dauid and all his men and spytt on hym dyspytfully And stones kest and fowle[s] [f]ene and oft sythys sayd apon hym fy. Kny?tes com fast hym to kyll, bot Dauid bad þem blyn, “I wott yt is goddes wyll; I suffer yt for my syn. 722 what meruel ys yt of þis dede A hethyn hownd me forto hatte Sen myn awn sun wyll haue no dred me forto brew all þis debate.” bot aftur sone, os men may rede, þis grome þat greued hym in þe gate be Dauid dome he had his mede and lost his lyf, yf yt ware late. In þis tym absolon, as kyng with playn power, Was comyn owt of Ebron to ierusalem ry?t nere. 723 When þei ware in þat Cyte sett, Archytofell, þat curssed kny?t, he sayd, “ser, and þou do þi dett, to Dauid sall þou doles dy?t; gar all his wyfes furth fast be fette hym to reproue by reson ry?t, And lyg by þem—for no thyng lett— playnly in þe pepyll sy?t. And þerby sall þ[ei] wytt and be exempyll se þat luf sall neuer be knytt be twyx þi fader and þe. 724 yf any gabbers wold hym glose to say þat he suld come agayn, by þis sy?t sall þei well suppose þat he sall neuer haue myrth ne mayn. So sall he all his lordschep lose and forto flee farre be full fayn. þen of þe chefe sall þou haue chose þat now ar to his bedyng bayn.” ffull wo þe wemen wore when he so wekydly wroght. þat Natan told be fore bud vnto end be broght. 725 Cusy com, kyng Dauid frend, to absolon, os I sayd ayre. he haylsed hym with wordes hend and loued god fast for his wele fare. Absolon asked what he mende and sayd, “swylke spekyng suld þou spare. with Dauid was þou wunt to wende, chefe of his counsell to declare.” he sayd, “ser, so I was whyls he stud in degre; Now lyst me lett hym pase and lede my lyf with þe. 726 I wott well yt is god[es] wyll þat þou be kyng with crown clere, And at all pepyll come þe [vntyll] to serue þe in seruyce sere. þat for ward wyll I fayn fulfyll with hert and hand, I hett þe here.” Absolon trowed of non yll and toke hym of his counsell nere. Cusy in cowrt sall dwell; ys non so grett to geysse All for archytofell to make his lordschep lesse. 727 þat wekyd man þen went full wyght to Absolon and says his toy?t, “ser, þou sall haue no rest ne [r]y?t tyll Dauid vnto ded be broy?t. Take me ten thowsand men of my?t; we sall not sesse or he be soy?t. we sall [be] nere þis ylk ny?t, and bot I take hym, trow me noy?t.” Absolon says, “sawyns fayle, a fayr profer þou mase.” bot fyrst he asked counsell of Cusy in þis case. 728 Cusy hath mynd both morn and noyne to helpe Dauid in his nede, And wele he wyst, yf þis ware done, he suld be dede with outyn drede. To absolon þus says he sone, “ser, þis spekyng may not spede; Ten thowsand folke wold be full fone into A fere land forto lede. þi fader is wunt to fy?t, and his folke er full fell. Ordand þou haue [more] my?t or þou [of] swylke maters mell. 729 Send aftur [all] þi kny?tes kene and aftur keyn men of þi kyn, And wend þi self þore to be sene; lett non oþer þat wrschep wyn.” Archytofell herd how þat þei men[e] þat Cusy consell was cald in. In hert he had so mekyll teyne þat langer he wold not byd ne blyn. Bot herd he con hym hy vntyll his howse at hame. In anger and in enuy he hanged hym self with schame. 730 On þis wyse was þe lordan lorn; we hope he hasted sone to hell. And Cusy wentt sone on þe morn to þe tempyll tythynges forto tell. Abyathar he fand hym be forn with mony mo mowrnand o mell. he told all how he had hym born, þat hanged was archytofell. And [he was] of consell to byde [at] bed and borde. þ[i]s tale fro tope to tale he told þem ylka word. 731 “werkes now,” he sayd, “by your wysdom þat kyng Dauid may here in hy how I haue ordand all and sum —I wott he wyl be fayn for þi— And byde hym flee be yond þe flum for beldyng of his awn body. ffor Absolon his sun sall come agayns hym with grett cumpany.” letturs be lyue þei sent; þis sand was for þer sele. wyse men so warly went; kyng Dauid wot ylk dele. 732 when Dauid had þe letturs rede, well comforth in his hert was he. ffurth ouer þe flum his folke he led to manahym, a grett Cyte. þe folke þat in þat sted ware sted welcumd hym with mekyll glee. And all þer beld to hym þei bed to byd whore so hym self wold be. þat Cyte was walled so wele, þer my?t no man yt myne. Ne þei dowt no dele for gune ne grett ingyne. 733 kyng Dauid þore with blyse con byde and had at wyll what so he wald. IIII barons wuned þer be syde þat send hym vytell all vnsald. þer helpe fro hym þei wold not hyde, bot hertly hetes with hym to hold, so þat he had to tell þat tyde IIII thowsand, þat ware knytes cald. In þis tyme Absolon had geydderd grett plente Of knyghtes þat cough þeron his fader bayn to be. 734 þei rested nawder day ne ny?t to þei þe flum ware passed playn. when þe had of þat Cyte a sy?t, whore Dauid wuned, þen ware þei fayn. bot he wyst wele þei had no my?t to towch hym, bot yf it wer with trayn. þerfor his men arays he ry?t þem forto mare with all his mayn. A perte to hym self toke he and vnto Ioab an oþer, And the thryd he bad suld be to abysay, Ioab broþer. 735 ffull fayn he wold with þem haue went, bot sone þei sayd hym þis myschefe, “yf þou ware in þer handes hent, þen had þ[e]i gam vs all to greue. And ser, yf sum of vs be shent, þe remland þen may þou releue. þerfor yt is not our assent þat þou owt of þis Cyte meue.” he thanked þem oft sythis þat shewed þer luf so large. bot he sayd, “lordynges, lythes! of A thyng I yow charge. 736 yf grace fall, when ?e haue be gun, þat ?e þe vyctory may geyte, loke ?e saue Absolon my sun þat he be nawder bun ne bette.” þei say, “and he in feld be fun, we sall full dewly do our dette. he sal be in no bandes bun.” I hope þei held all þat þei hette. Ioab with cumpany os principall furth past. his broþer Abysay folod on full fast. 737 Absolon on þat oþer syd come with his folke, fell os þe fend. And with þem was arayd to ryde Cusy, þat was kynges Dauid frend. þen was no bote to [byd a]byde, bot ylkon shope oþer to shend. Of all þer tolyng in þat tyd ware lang to tell bot loke þe ende. when Dauid men had slayn XX milia and moo, The remland ware full fayn with lyfes þer way to go. 738 Absolon, when he saw þat sy?t how þat his folke ware fayn to flee, Into a wod he rydes ry?t; þor trowd he best bel[d]yd to be. þe wynd heyued vp his hare on hy?t so þat yt cached in to a tre. his sted went furth his way full wy?t, and by the hare so hang he. ffolke fowled hym to f[e]re and fand hym in þe fyrth. bot non durst do hym no dere for dred of kyng Dauid. 739 when Ioab herd tell þis tythyng how Absolon hang by þe hare, he bede a boy fyfty schylyng to sla hym, or he farre fare. bot no man durst do swylke a thyng for Dauid dred, als I sayd ayre. þen Ioab toy?t yt hard hethyng and thrugh þe body þer hym bare. þus had þis man myschaunce and for non oþer thyng bot for myse gouernance and vnlefull lyfyng. 740 Sone Ioab herkynd and beheld all his enmys away wore gone. To geydder his men agayn to beld bugyls gart he blaw gud wone. Vnto his hand all con þei held. þat body down þen haue þei toyn And beyred yt fayre in the feld and mad a hyll of mony a ston. þus ended Absolon; so dyd archytofell, And hedyd was Amon for Thamar, so we tell. 741 when þis batell was done ylk dele, Ioab sent sone a messynger: Cusy, þat lufed Kyng Dauid well, was full mery to mend his chere. he told [hym] all fro hed to hele how þat þies folke ware hal[e] in fere. þe kyng sayd, “say me for my sele, ys my sun hole? þat wold I here.” he sayd, “ser, I wald byd þine enmys be tyd ylkon, Als þi sun is be tyd.” þen wyst he þat he was sloyn. 742 he syghyd sore and sayd, “alas, In werld is none so wyll of rede. þe wurthest wy?t þat euer was þis day with dole is done to ded. wold god þat I with payn my?t pase and to be styked þor in his stede. who so my sun dyssayued hath sall dere aby [that doylefull d]ede.” he drowped day and ny?t with sorow sore and sad. No myrth amend [hym] my?t; so wex he mased and made. 743 Duke Ioab and abysay, when god to þem þis grace had sent, went home with ryall cumpany, and wele þei trawed in þer entent fforto be welcumd worthyly sen þei for þe kynges wrschep went. bot euer he drowped and was drery, and for þei wyst not what he ment, þei ware full euyll apayd; and be cawse of þis tythyng ylkon tyll oþer sayd, “he sall not be our kyng.” 744 when Ioab wyst, he was full wo; be lyfe wentt whore þe kyng lendes. “ser kyng”, he says, “why dose þou so? þi self full shamely þou shendes. had þou leuer þe lyf of þi foo þen þe frenschep of all þi frendes? Bot yf þou gladly to þem go, all þis folk fast fro þe wendes. lett þi kyndnese be kyd and make mery chere.” Att his cownsell he dyde; so ware all fayn in fere. 745 þe gud byschop abythiar and sadoch, þat wytty prest be name, þei ordand clerkes þat [with] þem ware þe arke of god to kepe fro blame And also wysmen, non wold þem mare, to kepe þer kyng when he comys hame. þe kyn[red] of Iuda furth con fare; þei war þe fyrst soght to þat same. ff[or] þei fyrst made hym kyng at home in þer cuntre, þei went [fyrst] furth to bryng hym to his awn [cite]. 746 Vnto the flom haue þei soy?t, þ[ou]sandes mo þen neyn or ten. A bryg full wysly haue þei wroyt for Kyng Dauid and all his men. ffurth ouer þe flode þei haue hym broy?t, and for þer kyng all þei hym kene. þei þat be fore fauerd hym noy?t ware all full fayn to folow hym þen. þe kynred of Iuda ware next in cumpany. þerfor full mony ma ware greued with grett enuy. 747 Dukes, erlys and knythys kene, þat went with Absolon, his sun, when þat þei wyst withoutyn wene kyng Dauid suld in we[l]this wun, Vnto hym þen þei come clene and bed in bandes to be bun And mendes make, als he wold meyne, for greuans þat þei had be gun. he for gaf all þer gylt, when þat þei mercy craued. he wold þat non ware spylt þat wold þem self be sayued. 748 So als þei ryde rychly arayd, sodanly þat man þei mett, Semey, þat had hym myssayd and stoned with stonys in þe strette. he knelyd on knese and mercy prayd, and his frendes fell be fore þer fette. Ioab wold full fayn haue hym aflayd, bot þe kyng sayd, “hele I hym hete. Sen god forgyfes vs tyll and rychly vs releues, So sall we with gud wyll for gyf þem þat vs greues.” 749 ffurth in þer pase, als þei con passe, sone Mifbosett hath þei mett. he was þe sun of Ionatas, þat Dauid lufed deuly be dett. In febyll wede arayd he was and all his face with hare vmsett. þe kyng sone hym resond has yf any lede his lykyng lett: “þou hath catell and corne vnto þi bedyng broy?t.” he sayd, “lord, all ys lorn and me ys leued ry?t noy?t. 750 lord, my stewerd, ser Cyba, þou toke to me, [as man] most wyse; My lordschep hath he tane me fra, ay redy agayns me to ryse.” þe kyng sayd, “sen I see yt sa þat he hath wun lordschep with lyy[s]e, yt sal be perted be twyx yow two to tyme þat we may vs a vyse.” On knese þen con he fall and sayd, “so wyll not [h]e. gud lord, lett hym haue all, I wyll wende with þe.” 751 So went þei furth withoutyn more, all þat ware to his bydyng bown, To ierusalem, and when þei come þore, þei raysed hym vp with grett renown. In his astate con þei hym restore to reyn os ryall kyng with crown. ffolke of Iuda ware euer be fore to forther hym in feld and town. his wo was waryschyd þen and end mad of all, As þe prophett Natan sayd þat yt suld be fall. 752 Vnto þe tempyll þen con he fare; grett sacrafyce þei haue be gun. Prestes and clerkes, þat þen ware þore, þei ware full fayn þat he was fun. his ten wyfes, þat I told of ayre, ordand he wrschypfully to wun. Bot with þem wold he mell no mare by cause of Absolon his sun. þus was he gettyn agayn and sesyd in his kyngdom. his frendes ware ferly fayn, bot enmys had he sum. 753 Syr Cyba, þat I of ayre sayd, was lord of Mysbosett land. ffull ryally he hym arayd and full grett felnes fu[r]th he fand. A grett geydderyng sone hath he grayd of ebrews, þat he had at hand. And felous poyntes hath he purvayd þat Dauid in strengh suld not stand. “was he not gesse sun and of bedlem bredyng? whore has his fader fun þat he suld be kyng? 754 Sat he not als a sympyll page on feld to fede his fader fee? And aftur when he come of age cayred abowt in sere cuntree? And sythyn in were for his wage wrogh mekyll [woo], þis wele wott we, yf yt suld go by herytage, þen am I neghbour nere þen hee. þerfor I wold we wentt his forsce sone fort[o] shend.” þei sayd all, “[we] assent euyn as þou wyll to wende.” 755 Kyng Dauid herd tell tythyng þen how Cyba soght to do hym dere, And all on what wyse he be gan to gedder folke hym forto fere. he cald his cosyn Amasan, A Duke þat was full wyse of were. “Wende furth,” he sayd, “full wele þou can, to þe folke þat our frendes ere, þe kynred of Iuda, þat euer wyll vs releue, And say þem how Cyba ys ordand vs to greue. 756 Bot loke þou be by thre days end with all þi men at me agayn þat þou þen with my men may wende to mare þat traytur of his trayn.” Amasan wold no lenger [l]end; he soy?t on ylk syd certayn folke þat he wyst was Dauid frend; to fech þem furth he was full fayn. In all þat euer he moght þat space he sped and spend, bot Agayn com he noght when thre days was ende. 757 The kyng toygh he dweltt full lang and dowt Cyba suld þem schame. he bad Ioab, his stewerd strang, take þe knyghtes he had at hame Agayn Cyba fast forto gang: “Duke amasan, he dose þe same. when ?e ar mett your men amang, gos both to geydder in goddes name!” Duke Ioab sone was dy?t in all þat he my?t hy, And furth he rydes full ry?t with full clene cumpany. 758 So in his way, as he was sett, Duke Amasan sone can he see with full fayr folke þat he had fett and samned owt of sere cuntre. he toy?t, “bot I þis lordschep lett þe kyng sall prays hym more þen me.” þerfor he menys, when þei ar mett, with sum debate his bane to be. Duke amasan lyght down to com his [cosyn] vntyll. Duke Ioab mad hym bown his falshed to fulfyll. 759 In A fayr medew con þei mete. Ioab fard all with faygyng fare. his sword owt of his sheth he lete, ry?t os [yt] noy?t his wytyng ware. To Amasan spake he wordes swete, and com als he suld kyse hym þare. he toke þe sword vp at his fette, and throgh þe body so he hym bare. Two dughty Dukes of dede so had he murtherd þan, And all for erthly mede, Abnar and [A]masan. 760 when folke fand þis felous thyng, þei weped and had full mekyll wo. Duke Ioab fenyd a fals lesyng and bad þei suld not sorow so: “he was traytur vnto þe kyng; [and] I was sent hym forto sloo. To beryall lett [his] men hym bryng, and hast we fast to fell our foo.” he gart a man of his hyde þe cors owt of þe way, So þat men suld hym myse and make no more Daray. 761 So went þei furth to seke Cyba and with þer forse to fell his pryd. þei soght in towns to and fra and in Cytys on ylka syde. In A Cyte, þat heygh Abelay, þore had he beld hym to abyd. ffor yt was wardyd and wallyd swa, þei dred no tene þat my?t be tyde. Ioab and his mene?e to wyn yt ware in no dowt. þei seged þat Cete with bold men all abowt. 762 þei sett a sawtt with gunys gud, with bowes and with Alablawsters blend. þe fo[l]k within sone faled fode and had no forse þem to dyffend. A lady þat was myld of mode þore in þat same Cyte con lend. Apon þe walles ?eply scho ?ode and carped to Ioab, þat scho kend: “S[er], þou suld with reson the kynges folke fend fro noe, And here þou makes þe bown with strengh þem to dystroye. 763 ffor to dere þies here [þou] dwelles þat suld maynteyn [þeym] mor[n]e and [no]ne.” Ioab takes tent how scho hym tellys, and to hyr þus says he sone, “Ma Dame, to mare yow no man mellys. þis is our wyll with wordes foyne: fforto noy Cyba and non ellys. deliuer hym vs, þen haue we done.” þat lady wysly wroy?t; scho saw qwat suld be fall. weyle lese perell hyr toy?t [to lose oon] þen all. 764 A Commyn consell cald scho tyte and told þem holy as scho ment, And how Cyba was worthy to wyte of all the harme þei had þore [hent]. Smertly þei gart his hed of smytt, and [vn]to Ioab þei yt sent. hee remeued þen with owt respytt, and to ierusalem sone he went. þe kynred of Iuda, þat were ay frend[es] of old, went whore þei com fro and wrogh what euer þei wold. 765 Now is kyng Dauid broy?t to rest and rewlys his reme with ryalte. he ordand all thyng at þe best, os gud consell bad yt suld be. ffor hym and his court he kest gud seruytours semly to see And [for] his land by est and west gud gouerners in sere degree. All folke ware fayn to plese and heyld vnto his hand. Bot sone [fell sodan] dysese ouer all in his land. 766 Brede and wyn both wex so dere þat sympyll men my?t no socur gete. þe pure perysched fare and nere both for defawt of drynke and mete. þe kyng of god oft con inquere þe cause of all þat hungur grete. Natan þe prophett con apere and sayd for for faders forfett, “þe gud Duke Iosue heyght and ensured þer on þat peyse suld holdyn be with þe folke of Gabaon. 767 ffor he ensured þem on swylke wyse, all ware þei folke phylisteyn. he fended þem from þer enmys, euyn als þei Ebrews had beyne. he sayd no man suld þem surpryse agayns þe trews tan þem be twen. Kyng saul sauyd not þat assyse; þerfor now comys þe hungur keyne. And ser, it sall not sesse bot rayke abowt be ry?t Tyll þei be sett in pese and mendes þerfor be dy?t.” 768 Kyng Dauid, when [he] herd of þis, sent fast for þe folke of Gabaon And sayd, “sers, I wyll mend all myse þat ?e wyll rekyn by reson.”— “Syr Iosue heyght for hym and his to send vs pese in all seson, And kyng saul, þe sun of Cys, with his batels he bare vs down. þat was noy?t lafull thyng; þerfor vengance we craue. þerto answers þe kyng, “what vengance wold ?e haue?” 769 þei say, “vs nedes noy?t of þi gud, ne of þi catell kepe we none. Bot þat ar born of saul blod, delyuer vs þem ylkon.” when kyng Dauid þis vnderstud, þei soyght and sone gate gud wone. þe folke, þat were in wyll full wode, sessy[d] noy?t tyll þei were sloyn. þer cause þen þei relessed and hyed þem home agayn. And so þe hungur sessyd, and þen þe folke ware fayn. 770 þen in þe bybyll may men see þe kyng was oft in careys kest. And sythyn when he had playn pawste and all his perels war ouer past, D[i]ligam te, domine, þis salme he sett and sayd yt fast. þat menes: lord, I sall luf þe lelly whyls my lyf may last. with swylke prayers of price he honerde god euer more And with sere sacrafyce, os costom was þen þore. 771 Bot afturward he dyd a dede þat was full grett for goddes aw: To nowmber, when he had [no] nede, þe folke of god agayns his law. ffor moyses told, yf he toke hede, þat no man suld þe nowmber knaw Of goddes folke for dowt and drede þat god suld vengance schaw. ffor þat law lett he noy?t bot gart seke on ylka syd. Ioab þe nowmber broy?t and told to hym þat tyde. 772 he told hym of þe kynred ten, þat so many were sett in þat syght: Aght C milia feyghyng men þat ware in armys wyse and wyght. Of þe kynd of Iuda my?t he ken fyfty milia rekynd ry?t; Of leuy ware non rekynd þen, for þei ware no folke forto fyght. ffor orderd all ware þei vnto the tempyll at tent And for þe pepyll at pray þat þei no harme suld hent. 773 when þis was done, þe kyng sone knew þat god was [greued] in þis degree; þat rekynyng suld hym full sore rew, and mercy oft sythys asked hee. bot gad, þat was goddes prophett trew, he sayd hym sone how yt suld bee, ffor he had nowmberd so on [n]ew. god bad he suld chese on of thre: Enmys on sydes sere VII ?ere to were all ways, or haue hungur thre ?ere, or pestalence thre days. 774 kyng Dauid toy?t here full herd chose, for all þei grathed folke vnto graue. full loth he was his land to lose, and f[ro] hungur hym self my?t he saue. And ded, [he] wyst wele, wold not glose, ne take reward to kny?t ne knaue. And in god con he grace suppose; þerfor ded asked he forto haue. Sone on þe morn was told a mang þe kynredes twelfe: þe folke dyed so thyke fold þat non my?t oþer delue. 775 kyng Dauid in his towre con stand, and sone he saw a selcowth sy?t: An Angell in þe ayre fleand, þat feld þe folk with owtyn fy?t. he hasted hym with hert and hand to saue þe Cyte at all his my?t. ffull low he kneled down on þat land, wher on he saw þat angell ly?t. he prayd to god of heuyn to byd þat vengance blyne, And sayd, with sympyll steuyn, “lord, I dyd all þis syne. 776 þe pepyll vnto þe trespast noy?t þat suffers ded þus sodanly. bot I am he þat wrang hath wroy?t, and all þis wo I am worthy. let all þe bale on me be broy?t and spare þem þat ar not gylty.” þen god of heuyn, os hym gud toy?t, gaf þem grace and graunt mercy. he sent his prophett gad to say what he suld do, And euyn os god hym bad, he told kyng Dauid to. 777 he sayd, “þi myse forto amend god wyll þat þou werke on þis wyse: In þe feld, wher þe Angell dyscend, þore sall þi ryghtwysnese vp ryse. þou sall do make þore with þi hend An auter for prayers of price.” In þe same place, ose clerkes haue kend, made Abraham fyrst his sacrafyce. And sythyn in þat same stede, as boke wytnese þerby, was iesus done to dede and cald þe Mownt of caluery. 778 And in þat same place fyrst was fun A tempyll folke in forto pray, ffor þe qwylke kyng Dauid hath be gun in ylka poynt forto purvay And sythyn Kyng Salamon his sun raysed yt vp in ry?t aray And was cald tempyll of Salomon And ?ett is so, os we here say. fforther who likes to loke how all þat werke was wroy?t, Go to þe bybyll boke; þor may þei see vn soght. 779 And for kyng Dauid had warnyng by sere exempyls forto see þat Salamon his sun suld be kyng, on mony wyse hym warned hee To honer god ouer all thyng and to his bydyng bowsom be And forto gouernd old and ?yng ylkon dewly in þer degree, And sayd his lordes ylkon, fro tyme þat he ware dede, To socour salamon at stand furth in his sted. 780 Kyng [Dauid] wex þen all vnweld, no wounder was with owtyn wene, ffor he was gone in full grett eld and bressed in batels þer he had bene. Of kynd was his compleccion keled, and cold come on hym wonder kene þat in bed my?t he haue no beld for no kepyng with cloghes clene. Physissiens com hym t[e]ll be all þe wytt þei wote þat A ?ong Damsell ware best to hald hym hote. 781 And sone vnto þat same entent to hym was soy?t A madyn swete. On nyghtes he hyr in armis hent, and vnto hym scho held gud hette. In þat maner no myse þei ment, ffor vnto myrth was he not mete. Bot lenger lyf was to hym lent and fuller forse fro face to fete. þat byrd was not to blame, for fawt my?t no folke fynd. Abysag was hyr name and comyn of gentyll kynd. 782 he had a sun, heygh Adonay, þat fast be gane a fowle debate. To his broþer he had enuy þat he suld come to kynges astate. he chese to hym grett cheualry, qwylke he hoped wold his broþer hate, And sayd to þem, “next hayr am I, for I am elder, all men wele wate.” Of his assent [þen war] duke Ioab, þat gentyll jew, And þe byschop Abyathar þat Dauid trest for trew. 783 Sadoc neuer to þem assent, ne Natan, ne Neomi and oþer ma, Bot with kyng Dauid ay þei went; so dyd þe kynred of Iuda. Adonay to fulfyll his entent [made] a grett fest not fare þer fra, And all þat of þat mater ment war fayn vnto þat fest to ga. And þore assented þei all holy to this thyng, In all þat euer þei may, þat Adonay suld be kyng. 784 when Natan herd þer werkes wyld, he went belyue to barsabe And sayd, “þi sun sal be begylyd bot þou hym helpe by red of me. Go tell þe kyng with wordes myld how Adonay ordance kyng to be And how he heyght vnto þi chyld þat non suld haue þe crown bot he.” Scho went and asked þis bowne as woman full affrayd, And he come aftur sone vnto þe kyng and sayd. 785 he sayd, “ser, [is þis] with þi wyll þat Adonay be kyng on dese? All yf þou wold þat fare fulfyll, þou wot þat god an oþer chese.” þe kyng lyked his lesson yll and sayd, “Go sone, no lenger sesse. Tak Salamon my sun yow tyll with all my kny?tes hym to encrese. Rydes throwgh þis Cyte and says with solempne crye þat salamon sal be kyng of all þe jury! 786 Anoynt hym to þat same entent at þe well þat is named Wyon. þen Adonay and his conuent sall fynd how þat þei fowly fon.” when Natan herd how þat he ment, he mad no poyntyng þer apon, Bot aftur sadok sone he sent forto anoynt kyng salamon. Barons and knyghtes kene þat of þat cowrt ware kende And burgeys all be dene full sone war aftur send. 787 Thurgh [oute] þat Cety solemply þei went with cumpany full clene. At ylke corner gart þei cry þat salamon suld kyng be sene. when þo þat ete with Adonay herd nakers, trompes and clarions keyne, þei sent fast forto spyre and spy what all þat melody my?t be meyne. when Salamon was led and sett in þe kynges stede, þat feleschep fast fled for dred forto be dede. 788 Duke Ioab þen þat fest for soke and wyst wele þat þei rudly raue. Abhyathar, byschope with boke, was þen set os a sympyll knaue. And Adonay þe tempyll toke for sewrty so hym selfe to saue. he held hym be þe Auter noke, for þor he hoped his hele to haue. Salamon þen he knew for his kyng and his lord And send fast to persew for frenschep and acorde. 789 he sayd he wold amendes make for þat wrang þat he had wroght. þen salamon for goddes sake sayd no vengance suld be soyght; bot vnto trews he con hym take be þis assent þat he suld noy?t wayte hym with more wrangwyse wrake, ne do hym dere in ded ne toy?t. So salamon was sett in cowrse, os kyng suld be, And all ware frendes [mett], both his breþer and he. 790 Kyng Dauid þen full clerly kend how þat he chaunged hew and hyd. his messyngers full sone he send to Cetys sere on ylka syd. þe lordes þat in his land can lend, he bad þei suld not blyn ne byd bot hast to hym be for his end to here hym tell what suld be tyd. þe messyngers ar gone þis for ward to fulfyll. And sone þei come ylkon And þus he told þem tyll. 791 “sers”, he sayd, “þe suthe ?e see: Day of my ded be gynys to draw. I haue yow gouernyd in degree lely to lyf after your law, And ?e haue bene gud men to me and dewly done in dede and saw. Now wyll [I] consell here þat ?e luf ylkon oþer os ?e aw. yf ?e be fast in fere, foyce sall ?e fynd bot foyn. And yf ?e sonder sere, sone sall ?e be for done. 792 with bandes of ded so am I bun þat both me fayles flesch and bone. ?e sall haue salamon, my sun, to gouern yow when I am gone. And as I haue yow frendly fun, so, sers, beseke I yow ylkon þat ?e wyll with hym wend and wun so þat he wax not wyll of wone. God hath ordand hym kyng, þerfor I pray yow all To bow to his bedyng and com vnto his call. 793 he sal be wyse in werld all ways dewly to deme of euer ylk dede, And peyse sall be in all his days; þerfor to helpe hym, sers, take hede The tempyll of God ry?t forto raise, als I haue layd þe lenght and brede. I haue ordand what so men says þat of no thyng sall he haue nede. Of metall, tre and stone is puruayd grett plente And werke men full gud wone to sett in sere degree. 794 he sall fynd all ordand at onys so þat no more nedes to be boy?t: Gold enogh ry?t for þe noyns, and syluer sall he haue vn soght. Besandes, pyrry and prescius stonys ar plente to þat bygyng broy?t; Swylke welth os sal be in þat wonys ayre in þis werld was neuer wroy?t. Both wryghys and masons [fyne] þerto haue tane þer merkes And taylurs of engyne and Ioners gentyll of werkes.” 795 when he had warned þem on þis wyse and ordand all in gud degree, To god þei mad gret sacrafyce of bestes and gyftes full grett plente. And salamon, þat prince of price, þen sett þei in his fader see, And mad to hym sewt and seruyce and homage, als yt aght to be. Kyng salamon mad þat day grett fest to folke in fere, And þen þei went þer way and perted to placeys sere. 796 þen Dauid in his bed con ly; he had no forse to flytt þer fro. he cald his sun to byde hym by and sayd to hym be twyx þem two, “Sun, I sall wend heyn in hy þe gate þat all our elders go, whor we sall haue, both þei and I, als we ar worthy, wele or wo. þe law þat god hath lent loke þou neuer yt for sake, And trewly, sun, take tent his hows fayr forto make. 797 Sen god wold noy?t gyf leue to me at make his howse and haue my med, bot sayd þou suld þe maker be a[nd] lely lyf his laws to lede, And I haue ordand in all degre þat specially þe werke may spede, layt no defawt be fun in þe forto make endyng of þat dede. And fand forto socour þi men with all þi my?t. þen wyll þei þe honowr and reuerence in all ry?t.” 798 Also he sayd, “my sun, be ware for Ioab þat with fals enuy Slogh Amasan and Duke abnar, þe gentylest of all jury; þe fals byschope Abathyar, þat for soke me for Adonay. Take vengance, dere sun, when þou dare, of þem and als of Symei þat agayns me con com and dyd me grett dyspyte be fore I past þe flome. fand þou yt forto qwyte! 799 And, sun, loke þou þat þi fayth be fyne to [oon] þat I þen fand my frend. þat was þe baron bersylyne. when I in þis land durst not lende, he maynteyn[ed] þen both me and myne agayns my sun þat wold me shend. And, sun, yf þat he be ded sythyn, to þe ayrs of hym loke þou be hend. when I was fled and flemed and all þis myrth con myse, No socur to me semed bot only of hym and his. 800 And hertly, sun, þat þou þe hast to helpe all þat of helpe has nede, So þat þies wordes be not in wast þat I haue spokyn here for þi sped.” In bandes of ded þen was he brast þat vnto hele he toke no hede. So vnto go[d] he gaf þe gast furt at his lykyng forto lede. ffor he of mercy ment and end in trawth trewly, we trow his sawle went vnto clene cumpany. 801 þen þe lordes and lades dere and all his mene?e grett mornyng makes. ffor he was prince with outyn peyre wher so he past in ylka place. god was ay hend hym forto here, for yf he spend of myse his space, he syghyd euer with sympyll chere tyll he had graunt[yng] of [sum] grace. whyls he in lyf can lend, he ordan ylk thyng, Begynnyng, myddes, and ende, alon to goddes louyng. 802 A feller knyght was neuer be fore, ne þat fro yre so sone wold slake, Ne neuer man gat [so] grett thressour as he geydderd for goddes sake. Now of hym wyll we make no more; on mold he was with outyn make. Of salamon [werkes] how þei wore, sum sall we tell who so tent wyll take. And heyre our story twynes with þe secund boke of kynges, And the thryd boke heyre be gynnys. god graunt vs gud endyngys! III Liber Tertius Regum. 803 In þe secund boke be fore is told how Dauid, sun of Iesse, In barnhed he be gan to be bold whyls þat he keped his fader fee, And sythyn how he had welth in wold and honerd god in gud degree, And afturward how he was old and went whor god wold hym to be. This thryd boke is begun when kyng Dauid was dede, how salamon, his sun, was sett in þat same stede. 804 In þis same boke be fore is rede how Adhony toy?t full gret hethyng þat salamon suld so be sted of Ebrews folke [f]o[r] to be kyng. with all his forse fast he hym sped and sett hym selfe to þat same thyng. Bot sythyn he and his felows fled be cawse þei fayled of þer fowlyng. ffor he was elder broþer, well knawn in ylke cuntre, hym toy?t þer suld non oþer be kyng bot only he. 805 þerfor to seke sum sutell gyn he besys hym erly and late. Abysag was comyn of gentyll kyn, þat maydyn þat held his fader hate. he toy?t myght he hyre to wyfe win, so suld he gouernd grett astate. And þen he toy?t forto begyn agayns his broþer sum grett debate. To make þis barga[n] be he pursewed fast þer on Vnto þe qwene barsabe, þe moyder of Salamon. 806 when he come þor, on knese he kneled full softly os a sympyll knaue. “I pray your sun to be my beld, My dame,” he sayd, “and ?e vouch saue. I am his broþer elder of eld, all þof he all þis kyngdom haue. Bot Abysag to wyfe at weld I kepe not ellys at hym to craue. And ?e wyll aske þis bone, full mekyll yt mend me may.” Scho sayd, “þis sal be done,” and sone scho went hyr way. 807 Vnto þe kyng scho come in hy and haylssed hym be steuyn full styll. he welcumd hyr full curtasly and sayd, “moyder, what is your wyll?” Scho sayd, “sun, grett erand haue I, qwylke I wyll pray þe to fulfyll, Towchand þi broþer Adony, and to helpe hym I hald yt skyll. þat woman wold he wed to wyf yf þat þou wold, þat warmed þi fader bed and hym when he was cold. 808 ffor þis, sun, hath he me be sogh, and I beseke þe for þe same.” þe kyng wyst full well his toy?t þat all was forto schape hym schame. “Moyder,” he sayd, “meynys yow noy?t, when we ware with my fader at hame, how Ioab and he wunders wroy?t to make hym kyng and call be name. And þe same se I now he purpase more and more. To god I make my vowe: he sal be dede þerfore.” 809 he cald a knyght heyght Banay, and bad he suld tyte vengance take Of Duke Ioab and Adony for fals maystry þat þei con make, And sythyn also of Symey þat with stonys at his fader strake. Tho thre so had þer hyre in hy, aftur þer werkes ware worthy wrake. Abyathar was demed a[s] byschop aght to be. ffor falshed was he flemed and degrade of his degre. 810 And sadoke was made soueran hed als byschope stably forto stand. And when Duke Ioab þus was dede, Duke Banay was þore ordand fforto be stewerd in his sted, and all þe folke heldyd to his hand, And he þem forto rewle and rede agayn þer enmys in ylka land. Þen to kyng salamon was all folke fayn to plese. And in þe werld was non þat durst do hym dysesse. 811 kyng salamon gouernd hym so þat ylk land had of hym aw. he toke a wyfe wonder fayr hym to and þat lyfed by an oþer law. Scho was þe doyghtur of pharo, of Egyp kyng, cumly to knaw. Bot euyn als salamon wold do, Assented scho in dede and saw. he lyfed with outyn lese aftur þe law lely þat god gaf vnto moyses on the mownt of Synay. 812 kyng salamon þen and his men Vnto Ebron þer gattes hath grayd with sacrafyce þer god to ken, and of þer purpase was god payd. þei offerd mo þe[n] hunderthes ten of [calves] and lambs on auters layd. And on þe nyght nex foloand þen god spake to salamon and sayd, “Aske of me what þou wyll, and wheder þ[ou] wynke or wake, I graunt yt to fulfyll for þi gud faders sake.” 813 þen salamon aspyse gud sped what hym ware best of god to craue: “To aske ryches, þat is no ned, I haue enogh [on] all sydes to saue. And power nedes me non for dred, all dowtes me boyth knyght and knaue. Bot wytt þi folke by law to led and wyll to werke wele wold I haue.” god answerd þen and sayd, “þou askys all skylfull thyng. þis purpas ma[s] me payd. I graunt þe þin askyng. 814 More wyse and wytty sall þou be þen Iew or panym þat euer er past. And ose þou trewly trestes in me, fro þi kyngdom sall non þe kast, Ne þin ayres þat cumys aftur þe as lang os þ[ei] in law wyll last.” Of þis forward full fayn was he and thanked god fully and fast. þen wentt þei fro Ebron to ierusalem agayn. So was kyng salamon sett in his power playn. 815 In þis meyn tyme þat I of tell [a torfer] in þe town betyde: Two wemen in a hows con dwell, and both þei ware for comyn kyd. A myschef was meuyd þem o mell þat my?t no?t þen be hyld ne hyd. be for þe kyng on knese þei fell forto gyf dome, and so he dyd. Vnto hym told þe on þe cause of þer comyng ydder: “My lord, we two alon dwelled in a hows to geyddyr. 816 And we ware both be seson ry?t as grett with chyld os we my?t go. I was delyuer thrugh goddes my?t of a fayr son; so ware we two. And þis woman of þe thryd ny?t was delyuer of A sun also. Scho ouer lay yt with owtyn ly?t, And when scho wakyd, þen was scho wo. Bot a fals wyle scho wroy?t, lord, os I slepand lay: hyr ded barn scho me broy?t and toke myn qwyk a way. 817 And when I wakynd of my slepe and fand a ded chyld me be forne, No wunder was yf I wold wepe, for þat I lufed I had for lorn. By clere ly?t þen toke I kepe þat yt was neuer of my body born. My sun I saw by syd hyr crepe; þus has scho turment me þis morn.” þat oþer answerd agayn, “my lord, scho beyrs þe wrang. hyr awn sun has scho slayn; myn lyfes and may lyfe lang.” 818 The fyrst vnto þe kyng [þen] cryse, hyr hert was heuy os leþer or lede, “ser, I say yow þe sothe assyse as euer I styre owt of þis stede.” þat oþer cryd [full lowde], “þou leys, bo[t] my sun lyfes, and þin ys dede.” what was to werke now in þis wyse, þe kyng asked all his consell rede. þei sayd þei had not lered swylke case forto declare. þen bad he bryng a sword be lyue be for hym þare. 819 “And þe qwyke chyld þat þei fore chyd depart sonder here in þis place And gyf to ayder of þem a syd!” þe pepyll þen grett murmur mase. þei say, “yt wele [is] sene þis tyd of a new kyng A new comyn case.” bot þe moyder kneled and lowd scho cryde, “A mercy, lord, graunt me þis grace: Gyfe my chyld leue to lyfe, I make no more debate. All hole to hyr yt gyfe and lett me go my gate!” 820 þat oþer sayd, “so sall noy?t be, bot to be departed euyn yt aw. And take þat on half vnto þe; þat oþer [is] myn, now well I knaw.” And when þe kyng þis sy?t con se, syttand in Dowm, he sayd þis saw, “þe moyder of þe chyld hath pete. Delyuer yt hyr; þis lore ys law.” þen wex þe folke full fayn for ioye of þis jugment. And þat he was wyse certan, þe word full wyd whore went. 821 Kyng salamon þen con assay to sett goddes seruyce euer in sy?t And sythyn his reme forto aray and rewle his men by reson ry?t. In certan placeys he con puruay princes to purge þe pepyll ply?t, And Dukes full dere be dyuerse Day Dewly þer dome to dele and dy?t. Of folke þat to hym fell my?t no man tell þe teynd. Of all wytt was he well in werld, wher he suld wende. 822 And by his wytt and his wysdom vs menes that he made bokes thre. Ane cantica canticorum, þat is A boke of grett bonite. Ecclesiastecen kennes sum þe secund boke name[d] sal be. Proverbes and psalmes þen, as þei com forto be sayd in sere degree. Who lykes of wytt to lere or of counsell to craue, In þis boke may þei [h]ere what so þer hert wold haue. 823 þen ny?t and day was his desyre þe tempyll of god to dy?t and dr[e]se, Als Kyng Dauid, his souerayn syre. had laft þer to enogh ryches. Iram, þat was Kyng of Tyre, sent word by letturs, more and lesse, þat he suld haue with outyn hyre tymber of syder and of cypresse. So had he all þat nedes enogh, and wanted none. And to do dyuerse dedes werke men had he gud woyne. 824 Kyng Dauid, whyls he was on lyue, full gradly all þat ground be gan. Agayns his [strykes] wold no man stryue, bot held his mesurs ylka man. þan ware past to make rekenyng ryue, as cunnand clerkes declare yt can, ffawr thowssand ?eres fyfty and fyue fro þis werld was be gun to þan. In VII ?eres was yt sett, þe substance, tre and stone; bot afturward was ?ett ymage[s] of gold gud woyne. 825 þer was neuer beste þat man my?t neuyn, ne fulle þat was formed to flygh, þat ne yt was þer ordand full euyn of fyne gold and besandes bry?t. þe suteltes of science seuyn þor ware to red on raw full ry?t. yt my?t be lykynd vnto heuyn, for yt was euer lemand and ly?t. þen was wunder to tell, or to declare by skyll Of gold what grett vessell þat ware ordand þer tyll. 826 All ryches sere þer was to sett may no man say ne syng in sang. Of syluer my?t þei go and gete als men may now for marber gang. And gold was no more to be mett þen oþer metall ys vs amang. To tell þe lele with outyn lett sum suld suppose my wordes ware wrang. wher for who lykes to loke how all þat werke was wroy?t, go to þe bybyll boke! þore sall þei se vnsoght. 827 when all was done þus daynthyly þat to þat tempyll suld pertene, To halo yt þei hasted in hy þat goddes seruyce my?t þore be sene. þar congregacion of clergy cald þei fro all cuntre clene. þor was all maner of melody þat men be museke my?t of mene. Sothyn Salamon þe wyse of bestes, wyld and tame, Made solempne sacrafyce; all oþer dyd þe same. 828 To heuyn held he up þen his hend and prayd to god þus with gud wyll, “Gud lord þat ylk myse may mend, I loue þi loue both lowd and styll þat vnto me þis grace hath send my faders forward forto fulfyll And of þis hows forto make end, als þou þat tym told hym vntyll. And als my fader prayd, I pray with wyll and toy?t þat þou be plessed and payde of þis werke þat is wroy?t. 829 And all þat enturs in þis place aftur þi helpe to cry and call, lord, of þi gudnese graunt þem grace of all þer greuance, grett or small!” And als he spake so in þat [s]pace, god sent a sygne amang þem all: A flawm of fyre be fore þer face euyn on þer sacrafyce con fall And hent yt vp to heuyn with mynstralsy and sang. þe myrth my?t no man neuyn þat was made þem amang. 830 þen held þei with solempnite a fest full fyftene days be dene. þe fest was [named] Synophogy, whylke jews maynteyns ?ett þem be twen. þe arke of god in grett degree þor sett þei vp forto be sene. þei went ylkon to þer cuntre to abyd before whore þei had bene. Kyng salamon con byd in his [city] at hame. In all þe werldes wyde of his wytt went þe fame. 831 An oþer hows þen ordand he all only for his awn wonyng. And þat wa[s] mad in ?eres thre, all of ryches and ryall thyng. And þen [þe thryd] in forto be whe[n] he suld deme of old and ?yng. Swylke a hows was neuer sett forto se in erth to Emperour, ne kyng. The fawrt þen for his qwene qwer scho with blyse my?t byde, And for lades be dene serely on ylka syde. 832 þat hows was paynted with peramour, with resons ryall forto rede, And fowls [full fayre] of fauour, with sang and spekyng full gud spede, And flours in þer kyndly colour, os þei in feld ar folke to fede, And ylkon in the same sauour as yt suld in þe burgeon bred. All myrth þat men may tell was mad with outyn myse. who in þat hows my?t dwell thurt abyd no bettur blyse. 833 Kyng salamon ys now certan þat all the werld with hym wyll held, ffor all the Phylysteyns ar full fayn to forther hym in fyrth and feld. þer was neuer man so mekyll of main, ne that so grett wyt had to weld. ?ett at þe last yt is not to layn: with lust was all lost in his eld. wemen þat he con take with lust to lyg þem by, gart hym his god for sake and turnd to mawmentry. 834 ffyrst of his state to vnderstand how he be gan on [m]ys to go, he wed A wyf of paynyms land, was kynges doy?thur Pharo. ffor hyr þis hows was new ordand and for oþer of hyr mene?e mo. þei mad hym fond, and þat he fand, for his best frend be com his foo. Whyls he his god cowd knaw, All welthes he had gud woyne. And when he left his law, god leued hym þen allon. 835 Of qwennes þen had he hunderthes VII to weld at wyll ay when he wold, And thre hunderth of oþer euyn, doyghturs of Dukes and barons bold, Ay forto stand vnto his steuyn, and all þei vsed crowns of gold. Swylke howshald was noy?t vnder heuyn, bot for þis myse yt my?t not hold. Of Ebrews had he qwennes þat full wyse wemen wore, bot most part was paynyms þat plessed hym mekyll more. 836 þei fed hym fere in foly þat all his forse fouly he fyled. he made tempyls to mawmentry and to fals goddes þat hym be gyld. So he forgate god allmighty þat euer had bene his bote or beld, And lyfed in lust and lechery aftur þe wylles of wemen wyld. So Adam and sampson, our forfaders, ware flayd, Dauid and salamon with wemen ware be trayde. 837 he þat so wyse and wytty was þat vnder heuyn he had no make, þat [he] for lust suld be lorn, alas, and wast his wytt for wemens sake! God was greued with his grett trespase, for he to fals goddes con hym take, And sent þe prophet Achyas to warn hym how he wold take wrake. þe prophett sone was grayd, and to þat courte come he. “kyng salamon,” he sayd, “take tent what I tell þe! 838 þou wott wele how god gafe þe law to moyses in þe hyll on heyght, Qwylke wele þou wott all Ebrews aw to maynteyn euer with all þer my?t. And now þou wenes he con not knaw how þou refusys yt all vnry?t. he hath me sent to say þis [saw]: þi synes ar fowle be fore his sy?t. hard vengance wold he take so þat þou suld be lorne, bot for þi faders sake sum dele sal be for borne. 839 hee honerd god erly and late. þerfor god heyght, qwen he was past, þat þou suld stand with his astate in lordschep whyls þi lyf my?t last. All yf here þou wyll hym hate, þat forward sal be full and fast. bot þou sall [haue] bale and debate and with þin enmys oft [be] vmcast. And whore þou and no mo ys kyng of kynred twelfe, þi sun sall haue bot two assygned to hym selfe. 840 And so mony suld he noy?t haue bot for Dauid, þi fader dere, And als þe heritage forto saue þat all sall noy?t be sunderd sere. Ieroboam to þe is bot a knaue, sal be kyng of ten kynredes clere. And so for þou wold rudly raue, þ[i] sun sall part fro his power, qwylke he suld haue haly had noy?t þi boldnese bene.” þen salamon was sory, no wunder was to wene. 841 þen gretand vnto god he prayd, bot for all þat note was neuer þe nerre. All behoued be os the prophett sayd. ylk day wex with hym werre and werre. So owt of Egyp land was grayd A cumly kny?t, was cald Ader. A ryall ost sone he arayd kyng salamon of his my?t to marre. Duke Ioab slow his syre; þen my?t he yt not aqwyte, Bot now he had desyre to do Ebrews dyspytte. 842 when Ader herd Dauid was ded and Ioab, that his fader had slayn, And Salamon als soueran hed sett in all his power playn, þen wold he byd no bettur b[e]d bot went to werre Ebrews agayn. he brent and stroyd in mony a styd, and þerfor ware Phylysteyns fayn. And on þat oþer syde Ieroboam of Ioseph kyn, he redyd hym to ryde [the Reaume to weld and wyn]. 843 wele hernest men with hym he has. ierusalem he hasted hym vntyll. þore come þe prophett Achias and warned hym what was goddes wyll. þe pepyll lete he playnly pase, and in a sted he stud hym styll. A n[ew] mantyll abowt hym was; þat sped he hym fast forto spyll. On þe ground þer he yt spredes, and his sword owt he brayd And schare yt in twelf shredes, and on þis wyse he sayd, 844 “Ieroboam, þou sall vnderstand, os þou seys me þis mantyll twyn, so sall þe lordschep of þis land be departed in sonder all for syne. Ten kynredes sall held to þi hand, and þou sall were þem wele with wyn. And two are to þe hayre ordand, þat ar of Iuda and of byniamyn. And ierusalem Cyte sall he haue in his wald, And þi selfe sall kyng be of ten. þus hath god told. 845 And als lang os þou lufes his law, sall grett lordschep to þe be lent. And yf þou kest not hym to knaw, þi welth wyll sone fro þe be went.” Ieroboam sone aftur þis saw gret heghnes in his hert he hent. þe lordes he con fast to hym draw and made þem sone of his assent, so þat full sone had he mo lordes at his ledyng And wele mo commynte þen had salamon þe kyng. 846 kyng salamon þen fand and feld þat god was not fully his frend. qwat for grett dewle, qwat for eld in lyf he my?t no langer lend. þen my?t no boldnes be his beld, [bot fro his welth] behoued hym wende. All wysdom þat he had to weld was turned to foly be for his end. Ryches rewled vnry?t is no thyng forto neuyn; Ne wytt may haue no my?t with owtyn helpe from heuyn. 847 Ne pro[w]yse ys no thyng in prise with outyn grace of god allmighty, bot he þat ys the hegh Iustyce may mend all myse thrught his mercy. So endyd salamon the wyse; I wott not what he was worthy. þei layd hym whore his fader lyse in þat same Cyte solemply. IIII score ?eres ware past our whyls he had kynges power. And IX score ?ere and IIII was all his wonnyng here. 848 when salamon þus had mad end and [g]yfyn his gast to goddes grace, þe lordes þat in þat land con lend þei toke þer counsell in þat case who suld haue force þem to dyffend agayns þe phylysteyns, þer fase. And roboam, his sun, þei kend for myghty [man] and most ry?t has. þei sembled in sych[em], a cyte of grett renown, Nere to ierusalem, A kyng þer forto crown. 849 when þei ware geydderd grett and small, vnto þer werke sone þei went. An Alderman spake for þem all and told to Roboam þer entent And sayd, “ser Roboam, þou sall be our sufferan, so haue we ment. And we sall com vnto þi call so þat þou tyll our sawes assent. we ware [fayne] forto plese þi fader, ose for our kyng. And he dyd vs dysesse and wrang in sum werkyng. 850 þou wot full wele Ebrews ar we to lyf be þe maners of moyses. þi fader greued vs in degre; of our assyse he made vs sesse And to be thrall, whore we ware free, agayns the law; þis ys no lese. Of all swylke poyntes aske we þe all holy forto haue releyse. And yf þou graunt this thyng, þen wyll we graunt agayne þat þou be crowned kyng And we þi pepyll playn.” 851 whe[n] Roboam herd how he says, he thynkes þe pepyll rudly raue. þat purpase no thyng to hym pays forto graunt þem so þat þei craue. he sayd, “ser, respeytt of thre days, and þen your answer sall ?e haue.” þem toy?t he suld make no delays, bot neuer the lese þei vouch saue. And in þies thre days [þ]en, whyls þei þis conuent held, he asked red at old men þat with his fader dweld. 852 þei sayd, “ser, we assent þer tyll þat þei be als þere elders wore And haue þer fredoms to fulfyll, als þer faders had be fore. yf þou wyll graunt þem with gud wyll, þen wyll þei lely luf þi lore. And [yf] þou part from þem with yll, of counsell þen can we no more. Syr, yt is wysdom, and wys men hath bene lefe To suffer A lese yll com and lett [a] more myschefe.” 853 when Roboam þies wordes her[s], þis purpase was not to his pay. he cald to hym ?yng bachelers þat he was wonnt with forto play. he says, “o[m]ys þis m[e]n me lerys to make my lordschep les for ay. wyll ?e assent to swylke maners?” þei answerd and sayd [s]chortly, “Nay! Bot os þei boun haue bene to þi fader be fore, þe same sall þou maynteyn and make þem sugettes more. 854 And tell þem þis to vnderstand: þou hath more strenght maystrys to make In þe lest fynger of þi hand þen was in all þi fader bake. And whore he bett þem with A wand to hold þem law with outyn lake, bett þou with scorpions, we warand.” all þus dyspytfully þei spake. þen Roboam was well payd; hym lyked to frayn no ferre, bot to þe pepyll he sayd he suld do so or warre. 855 þies wys men red refused he has, and aftur ?ong men ways he went. þerfor þe pepyll fast fro hym pas; Non bot two lyneg with hym [l]ent. So was þe wordes of achyas fullfylled þat told þus his entent: Ry?t ose his mantyll reuyn was, so suld þe reme be raysed and rent. þe same was s[en] þat day; god wold þat yt ware so. Ten kynredes turned a way and with hym left bot two. 856 A redlese man was Roboam when þe pepyll went þer ways. he sent a prince heyght Adoram, and to þe pepyll full fayr he prays. And lordes ylkon he neuynd by name. “comys agayn, gud sers!” he says. “My lord says ?e sall haue þe same þat ?e had in your fader days Or bettur, yf þat he my?t; I vndertake to yow.” þat spekyng was for noy?t; his tayles þei wold noy?t trow. 857 þem lyst not bow, ose he þem bade, bot with dyspytt hym to dyspyse. his messynger þei stoned to ded and send hym word on þis kyn wyse: þei wold neuer hald hym for þer hede þat made þem fayle of þer fraunchese. þen Roboam was full wyll of rede; he went whore no releuyng lyse. So folke may frenschepe fayle and oft sythys harmes hent be cause of yll counsell, yf þei sone wyll assent. 858 he saw þe pepyll ware past hym fro And Adoram his cosyn slayn. ffro sychem þen fast con he go vnto ierusalem euyn agayn. And with hym went þe kynredes two þat ware euer to his bedyng bayn. Of all the twelfe he had no moo; so ware þei sonderd for certayn. þo kynredes mad hym kyng of þem and þer cuntre And oblyst, old and ?yng, at his bedyng to be. 859 þen is yt tym furth forto tell what be tyd of þe oþer ten. I[e]roboam was ferse and fell and þe most cumly þat þei ken. þei mad hym kyng of israhel, and holy þei be come his men. þore was no more þer kynges o mell bot Roboam and Ieroboam þen. both byschopes, prestes and clerkes with all þer barn teme þat gaf þem to goddes werkes wuned all in ierusalem. 860 Now ware þer [two] kynges in a cuntre, and so þe folke ware sunderd sere. Ieroboam now lett we be þat hath to hym ten kynredes clere. Of Roboam furth speke wyll we more of his lyfyng forto lere. he soiorns in his awn Cyte and full fayr folke with hym in fere. VIII milia knyghtes kene had he of his assent And oþer folke full [cl]ene þat to hym wold take tent. 861 he made in þe cuntre of Iuda A Dossan Cytes [stif] of stone. To byniamyns he made wele ma, for gold ne werkmen want he none. And wele he ordand in all þa of whett and oyle and wyn gud woyne And armours both to frend and fa to haue new when old ware gone. XVIII qwenes with hym ware and of oþer thryty and one; bot þe chefe ?ett was Thamar, þe [doyghtur] of Absolon. 862 he spake with hyr most specially, for scho was of his kyn most nere. his ayre was born of hyr body, hey?t Abyam, ose men may here. he had of qwenes and oþer by XX and VIII sons all sere, And sexty doyghturs, I dar not ly. the feleschep was fayr in fere. No man on mold my?t knaw of his tresour þe tend. Ay whyls he lufed goddes law, all folke ware fulli his frend. 863 bot oft sythyes haue we sene the same: grett ryches makes men myse to spede. so ferd yt with kyng roboam, als wyttenes boyth his word and dede. he was so ryche in hows at ham þat vnto heuyn toke he no hede. he loued noy?t [n]euyn god by his name, for of his helpe he had no nede. he forgatte god allmighty þat all his sele had sent. In prid and lychery was all his lykyng lent. 864 So lyfed lordes of his land be dene, and aftur all þe pepyll playn. by yll exempyls oft tyms is sene ffull mony sawlys with syns slayn. Also we se sum men wyll wene þei be noy[?]t sure with þer sufferayn bot yf þei of his maners mene and maynten þem with all þer mayn. ffoule syn of sodomyte vsed þei euer ylk man. God was noy?t worthy to wyte yf he toke vengance þen. 865 Kyng sysoc come to þat cuntre; fro egyp broy?t he his baytell. A mille charyottes had he, all full of armours and vytall, And knyghtes full semly forto se sexty milia trew to trayvall, And folke on fote full fayre plente faurty milia þat w[y]ll [noy?t] fayle. þei wasted all þat was wroy?t in burghes abowt sychem. And so sadly þei soy?t ry?t to ierusalem. 866 The Cyte thynke þei sun to wen and conquere yt be clene maystry. Kyng Roboam þat was with in to see þat syght was full sary. þen for to [grete] he con be gyn and vnto god fast call and cry. he sayd, “þis sorow is for my syn, and all þis wo am I worthy.” To þe tempyll went þei all þat in þat Cyte ware, And þore on knese þei fall, [gretand] to god full sore. 867 god sent word with his prophett playn when þei so þer defawtes feld, And sayd þat þei suld no?t be slayn, bot þat þei suld þat cyte ?eld To sysoc als þer soyuerayn, and þat he suld þer wrschep weld And þat þei suld serue hym for certayn. of god þei gate no bettur beld. he sayd, “so sall ?e see wheder yt be more honoure Sisoc seruandes to be or goddes, your cryature.” 868 þen had kyng roboam mekyll kare, for þis forward bus hym fulfyll. þe cyte he delyuerd þare, b[ot] þis co[nn]and he toke þer tyll so þat þei suld þe pepyll spare and do no greue to gud ne yll. Kyng sysoc and all þat with hym ware enterd þen at þer awn wyll. þore fand þei grett ryches þat salamon sett to saue. how so þer connand [i]s, þat thynke þei forto haue. 869 þor thurt no man þer traueyll tyne, for thresour þei fand full gud woyne All vesels mad for mete and wyn ware pyght with mony a prescius stone, And all of gold full fayr and fyne and well enamyld ylkone. P[o]tes, pans and caldrons in kechyn, wars þen of syluer was þer none. with in þe kynges palyse, of all þat þei þer fand, þei left noy?t forto prays to valow of a besand. 870 þen to þe tempyll past þei playn and spoled yt full dyspytfully. þer gate þei gold þat wele my?t gayne grett cytes forto byg and by. þe folke was of þat fare full fayn, Als þei had grett encheson why. [Kyng sysoc went so home agayn, grete mirth mad all that cumpany.] ffor was neuer folke be for, als ferre os men may thynke, [That wan so grete tresour and with so litle swink.] 871 [Kyng Roboam then in kare was cast;] no comforth in þis case he kend. In XVIII ?eres his lordschep last, god lyst no langer to lett hym lend. when fyfty ?eres ware fully past fro his begynnyng vntyll his ende, þen seknes fell on hym [so] fast þat no fysyke my?t hym dyffend. bot sone enturd he was wher his elders lay, And his sun Abias was kyng aftur his day. 872 Now of Abyas lett we be forto be [?emyd] whyls he be ?yng, And of I[e]roboam speke we þat of ten kynredes þen was kyng. he had slyke prid for his pauste þat he sett by none erthly thyng; Ne vnto god no hede toke he þat gaf hym all þat gouer[n]yng. þe law þat god had lent, þat lykes hym noy?t to lere, bot brake his commawndment, and how sone sall we here. 873 The jews vsed forto make a fest at þe tempyll ylke ?ere onys or twyse. And ydder suld come both most and lest and make þore solempne sacrafyce, Sum with fowle and sum with best to offer ylkon on þer wyse. Ieroboam was so with prid encrest he wold not seke to þat assyse. Sone in his hert he cast a wylle with wekyd wyll, And hasted hym full fast þat falshed to fulfyll. 874 “To ierusalem yf I suld ga and all my frendes with me in fere, þe byniamyns and of Iuda suld make my men so mery chere, And þei suld [þere] be charest swa with seruyce and with solace sere þat full fell folke suld turne me fra. þer for A new law wyll I lere.” In Bethel so he spake, A Cyte of grett pryse, A calf of gold to make euyn at his awn Deuyse. 875 he cyted to þat same Cyte all þat come of kynredes ten, And vnto þem þan þus sayd he, “sers, our costom wele ?e ken: how our hye fest sall halowd be euer ylk ?er, ?e wot wele when. And als ?e wott, we are [as] fre as byniamyns or iudeys men. And ierusalem is farre als febyll folke suld fele. I haue ordand vus nerre to hald our fest full wele. 876 ffor wele we wott, els wene we wrang, god hath power in ylka place. ?e sall haue here a god full strang to gouerne you and graunt yow grace. we sall ordand our self amang prestes and dekyns in dyuerse space. And I my self be for sall gang forto gyf sense be for your face.” þis poynt þe pepyll plese. þei say, “assent wyll we; So sall we [haue] more ese þen kayre to farre cuntre.” 877 þen with all craftes he cowth controue a tempyll sone he hath ordand And made an Auter noy?t to moue bot stably in þat sted to stand. þe calf of gold he sett above, and all þe folke þen he commawnd Ry?t os þer lord yt forto loue þat led þem owt of egyp land. he says, “þis same is he þat our formfaders led Safe throwgh owt þe se when þei fro pharo flede.” 878 ffals prophettes wund in þat toun þat of þis fare was ferly fayn And sayd þei suld be ry?t resoun maynteyn all þat purpase playn. þei went and dyd deuocion to þat mawment with my?t and mayn. þe kyng arayd þei redy boun forto gyfe sense als þer soyuerayn. Als þei with werke and wyll þor mad þe[r] mawmentry, A prophett com þem tyll, was sent from god allmighty. 879 To greue þem þus he [c]a[n] be g[y]n þat all þe folke my?t here on hyght, “Th[ou] Auter þat [is] sollyed with syn, I warne þe here and ylka wy?t. þer sall spryng owt of Dauid kyn A kyng, Ioas his name full ry?t. he sall dystroye both more and myn þat mayntenys þe with any my?t. both prophettes, prestes and clerkes þat now are mad on new, he sall wast all þer werkes. and þat þis tale be trew 880 A sygne here sal be redy grayd: All þis fals fare sall fall as fast. þou and all þat on þe is layd sodanly sall doun be cast.” And als sone as þis word was sayd, All syd fro syd in sunder brast. þen ware þo folke full yll affrayd and Ieroboam gretly agast. he turned hym in grett tene, for þe prophett harme suld haue. bot vengance sone was sene; god wold his seruand saue. 881 Euyn os he ryched owt his ry?t hand and presed þe prophett forto sloo, Starke ase a stafe his arme con stand and wold not bow his body to. So all his falshed sone he fand, and fayn he was to flee þer fro. he cryd mercy to god weldand And prayd þe prophett he suld do so. þe prophett for hym prayd, als all þe pepyll hym prays. And sone by he had sayd, his arme was all at eys. 882 þen had þe kyng comforth full grett and prayd to þe prophett specially þat he wold dwell with þem to mete. þerto þe prophett sayd in hy, “god bad I suld noy?t drynke ne ette with none of all þis cumpany. his bedyng wyll I not forfeytt; þerfor my way fast wend wyll I.” he left þat folke in fere, and furth he wentt þem fro. þen was þe kyng in were what hym was best to do. 883 A fals prophett þor wonnand was þat had rewled all þat yll aray. when he wyst how þe prophett pas, he thynkes to marre hym and he may. ffast aftur hym hasted he has and ouer toke hym by tym of day. And hertly cause of hym he as why þat he went so sone away, And sayd, “ser, certes, I wend þat þou wold dyne with me.” he sayd, “god me dyffend to dyne in þis cuntre.” 884 The fals prophett sayd, “ser, certayn I am in message sent hym fro. he bydes þat þou sall turn agay[n] and dyne with me, now or þou go.” so sayd þat traytour for þis trayn to gare hym breke goddes bedyng so þat þei my?t haue þer purpase playn. to bethell þen turned þei two. þat fals prophett hym plese and mad grett myrth o mell, bot sone amang þer meses he had messag more fell. 885 god sayd hym in þat same sesoun, “for þou so sone was of assent Att turn agayn vnto þis toun and dyne agayns my commawndment, þou sal be slayn with a lyon, and to þi cors he sall take tent.” All þis he fand full redy boun or he ferre fro þat cyte went. A lyon hym deuored, and oþer bestes to lett Styll be þe cors he cowred tyll folke com yt to fett. 886 by men þat kayred þore in cuntre sone ware þer tydynges told þat tyd. þe fals prophett þen hasted he aftur þat cors to ryn and ryd.

Ieroboam sett noy?t þer by bot wex wers þen he ayr had bene. þe folke full fast can fayle als þei þer soyuerayn saw. þei made goddes of metall and left all moyses law. 890 he had no [mynd] of goddes my?t; so fell he fowly in dyspare. And by goddes law he sett full ly?t; þerfor he fell fowle and noy[?]t fayre. he sembled men full wyld and wy?t; to Ierusalem he cast to kayre Abiam forto fell with fy?t þat of þat reme was ryghest ayre. bot sone when þe ?yng kyng herd tell of þat tythand, he had at his ledyng fayr folke fawrty thowssand. 891 To Ieroboam sone he remewes, and both þei mett a pon a playn. he carped to hym and told in trewes, “ser, þou wott þi self certayn we [are] one men and all ebrews; þerfor yf auder syd be slayn, þat oþer syde full sore yt rewes. þerfor is gud to turn a gayn.

Ieroboam had mony jews, bot god was noy?t þer gouernoure. þerfor þat semble sone he rews, and sadly sekes he to socoure. kyng Abiam prestly persewes and wan þer gold with grett honoure. Ieroboam folke þei fynd in fel[d] V thowssand sloyn. þo leued he hym be hynd, And Abiam noy?t on. 895 when kyng Abiam had his wyll, to ierusalem he turned agayn. In þat Cyte he soiornes styll with mekyll solace for certayn Thre ?eres his tym forto fulfyll and honerd god with all his mayn. And þen he dyed with angers yll, als ylka man bus pase with payn. And sone when he was dede, his eldest sone Asa was crowned in his sted and cald kyng of Iuda. 896 þis ?yng kyng Asa lett we dwell styll in strengh, os he is stad.

And for Ieroboam sede suld noy?t thryue, Na[b]a[d] his sun dyssayued he. Sythyn stroyd he vp man, chyld and wyue of his kynred in þat cuntre. Of þat lyne leved he none o lyue. þe prophett said yt suld so be. þas þat in towns war dede howndes laped þer blode. þat dyed in oþer sted ware leued to foyles fode. 898 þei ware dystroyd both ?yng and old, and all þat sorow was sen for syne. kyng baasa þen was brym and bold; bale forto brew wold he not blyne. he was rych of gud and gold. to mak hym goddes he con be gyn And sayd þei suld werke ase he wold, and so he suld all wrschep wyne. he forgatt god of heuyn, þat hath all hele in hand, And his condicions euyn held þe lordes of his land. 899 he lyfed in lust and lechery, in hatred and in hertly pryde. To gud men had he grett enuy þat serued god on any syde. And for he wroy?t so wekydly, god wold not lett hym lang abyd. A prophett Iew he sent in hy to tell hym all what suld be tyd. he sayd by cause he dyd like to Ieroboam, Euyn als h[im] betyd, so suld he haue þe same, 900 he and his kynred euer ay whore [b]e dystroyd, in what eld so þei ere. þen wex his malyce mekyll more; þat mater meynys he forto mere. þe prophett gart he slay ry?t þore, for þis tale suld be told no fere. And yf he had done yll be fore, þen kest he forto werke mekyll werre. he honerd goddes of metall, þat mys [trewth] hym be trayd, for all behoued be fall als goddes prophett had sayd. 901 bot fyrst he wroy?t full mekyll wa be were and be wyked wyle And most vnto þe kyng asa, þat honerd god in all þat whyle. he had a Cyte heyght Ramatha, from ierusalem full fawrty myle And langed to þe lynage of Iuda. þat Cyte gatt he sone with a gyle. þore thynkes he forto dwell and do kyng asa skathe. þe land of israel so my?t he were fra wathe. 902 he meneys to [make] þat Cyte strang for hym and [for] his frendes ylkone. wyght men on ylka syd gart he gang and broy?t ydder both tre and stone. kyng Asa toy?t þat layke full lang, and power to hym had he none. þer for to wreke hym of þat wrang A purpase playnly hath he tone. he sentt sone for socour[s] wher þe hethyn holdyn þer hame, To þe kyng of matenours, [Bene]dab by name. 903 by cause he was his fader frend, in hym full fast he con affy. þat kyng baasa suld not hym shend, of helpe he prayd hym specially. kyng [Bene]dab with wordes hend sayd he suld haue helpe in hy And wyghtly ordand hym to wend to israel with grett cumpany. Cytes and burghes þei bryntt and slow men lese and more. Cornys and wynys þei shent, all þat þei fand be fore. 904 when tythynges com to kyng baasa of þe phylesteyns ferse and fell, þen bud hym refuse Ramatha and wend to rescow israel. Els wold þe enmys byrn and sla and dystroye þe burgh of bethell. lo, how god comforth kyng asa, and he meued hym no thyng omell. To Rama he con repayre and toke yt into his hand. he byged yt wele and fayre with store þat he þore fand. 905 kyng [Bene]dab grett welth had wun, and home he wentt warly and wele. kyng baasa sone in bale was bun and dyed with dole and dred sum dele. And aftur regnyd helam, his sun, and mad maystryce and mekyll vnsele; ffor yf þe fader fell was fun, þe sun was feller be fere to fele. þerfor he last not lang: with in two ?eres sesoun An a?ary hey?t hym wrang, slo[gh] hym and toke þe crown. 906 þis new kyng þen, A?ary, wuned in a town was named tharsa. he stroyd all þe progeny þat ware comyn of þe kyng baasa. þen had þe folke to hym enuy þat ware wonnand in gabatha. þei mad þem a kyng hey?t Ambry; then had israel kynges twa. kyng Ambry mad hym boun þat oþer new kyng to noye. he beseged tharsa toun kyng a?ary to dystroy. 907 kyng a?ary knew þem full of yre, and he had no forse hym to fend. his awn palyse he sett on fyre, for bettur comforth none he kend. he brent hym self both bone and lyre; on þis wyse was his wreched ende. þen had kyng Ambry his desyre, and furth in lordschep con he lend. XII ?eres and no ferre lasted his lordschep þore, Als yll of werkes or warre as any was hym be fore. 908 when XII ?eres ware done be dene, he dyed with wo, þat I warrand. Acab, his sun, was sythyn sene kyng and lord of israel land. And yf his elders yll had bene, he was þe warst of hert and hand. þat aftur turned hym selfe to tene, bot fele folk fyrst his fawtes fand. þus ferd yt of fyue kynges in schort tyme forto tell. ffor þei brake goddes bydynges; þei haue þer hame in hell. 909 Bot kyng aasa of Iuda land, he lyfed in luf and charete. full fawrty ?eres was he renand and rewled his reme in gud degre. he honerd god with hert and hand so þat no man my?t say ne see wherfor god suld be oght grochand, bot yf yt ware for thynges thre. And on was for he send [vn]to a paynym kyng ffro his fase hym to fend, and asked not goddes helpyng. 910 An oþer was when a trew prophet fro god of heuyn to hym was grayd And told hym how he had forfett and owt of reson myse arayd. In stokkes full sore he gartt hym sett, for he þe sothe vnto hym sayd [Of evill lyvyng hym forto let, and of that warke god was not payde]. þe thryd: of seknes sore forto haue help in hy In lechys he trest more þen in god allmighty. 911 kyng asa dyed in gud degre, for in all his werkes was he trew. he had A sun semly to see, hey?t Iosaphat, A gentyll jew. Aftur his fader regned he in ierusalem os gud Ebrew. he was the best of all b[oun]te aftur kyng Dauid þat men knew. vnto goddes law he tentes both by ny?t and day And kepes his commawndmentes in all þat euer he may. 912 he was full buxum and full bayn to beld all þat in bales ware bend, And forto put þe pure fro payn wold he hym hast with hert and hend. þe fals phylysteyns ware full fayn þer seruyce both to say and send, So þat all folke of hym ware fayn with all þer my?t his my[s] to mend. þe prophettes, prestes and clerkes þat mayntened goddes seruyce Both with wordes and werkes he wrschept in all wyse. 913 The tempyll of god he can restore with reuerence and with rych aray, qwylk fals phylesteyns lang be fore had brokyn doun and born a way. Euer ylk thyng he ordand þore þat he hoped my?t plese god to pay, And so increyst ay more and more in gud maters all þat he may. Now Iosaphatt lett we dwell lyfand to goddes lovyng, And of yll Acab tell þat was of israel kyng. 914 we told how fyue be fore had bene þat yll be gan and als yll end. þis was þe werst with outyn wene, for of more malyce euer he mend. he toy?t no myrth was more to mene þen goddes folke scham and shend. And lyke to hym he toke a qwene of phylysteyns, full of þe fend. hyr name was I[e]sabell, þe kynges doyghtur of tyre. malyce to meue and mell þat was hyr most desyre. 915 kyng acab mad goddes of metall and gaf to þem wele gud woyne. bot scho mad hym more fouly fall þen forto wrschepe tre or stone. he made a tempyll to beall, was g[o]d of t[y]re and sydone. On knese to hym þei cry and call and says he ys þer lord alon. Scho ordand for þo werkes, als woman wardly wyse, ffals prophettes, prestes and clerkes euyn at hyr awn deuyse. 916 And trew prophettes of god allmighty, prestes and clerkes and byschopes bathe, þem gart scho spyll dyspytfully; þer none my? skape with owtyn skathe. kyng Acab fauerd hyr for þi in all hyr werke, yf yt ware wath. þerfor god send his sand in hy to make hym wytt how he was wrath. Ely þe prophet trew fro god to hym was grayd. he told hym tythyng new, and on þis wyse he sayd, 917 “God sendes þe word by me certayn, for þou mayntenys on yll maner þi wyf þat [has] h[is] seruandes sl[a]yn and makes þe goddes of fendes vnfere. with in þi reme sall fall no rayn, ne dew sall now fro heuyn A[pe]yre To tyme þat I com here agayn, and þat bees noy?t of all þis ?ere.” The kyng þen toke gud tent and hopes he be be gyld. And þe prophett so went his ways vnto þe woddes wyld. 918 he logeed hym in a forest fayr whore erbs ware grouand full grene, And þor he fand low in a layre A spryng with watur fresch and clene. god sent hym breyd owt of þe Ayre þore whore none be fore had bene with ray[u]yns þat cowd to hym kayre. so selcoth sy?t was seldome sene. Alon so lyfed he þore, to none his nedes to neuyn, well VII mo[nth]es and more with helpe of god of heuyn. 919 In þe meyn tyme be tyd yt swa þat all þe erth was dry be dett. And his fresch watur fayled [hym] fro; þen was his lyst of lyfyng lett. þen bad god hym þat he suld ga for þat defawt his fode to gete Into A Cyte heyght sarepta, in þe syd of sydone was sett: “To a wedow þer I spake, qwylk to my bedyng is bayne, To fede þe for my sake. þus sall þou fynd certayn.” 920 þen was ely in stallworth state when he þe bote of god con here. To Sarepta he toke þe gate, als his lord con vnto hym lere. þe wedow was with outyn þe ?ate and geydderd wod with sympyll chere. he prayd hyr hys threyst [to] abate to helpe hym with sum watur clere. Scho sayd, “styll here abyd!

And for þat poynt I haue purvayd, þe same sall on my self be sene. I haue with in my bowre, I wyll þou wytt all wele, bot A handfull of floure and a lytyll oyle in a skele. 922 I geydder wod, os þou may see, for aftur goddes wyll wold I yt wore.

And als þin oyle sall þe avayle to tym þat god sum socour send.” Scho [wold] noy?t [fyne] þen forto trayvell bot kyndly dyd os he hyr kend. hyr flour þen fayled noy?t, ne hyr oyle wex not to wast Tyll god, ose hym gud toy?t, hey?t þem his helpe in hast. 924 Aftur þis tyme be tyd yt so: þe wedow sun was ded with payn. þen was þat wedow wonder wo and mad grett sorow for certayn. To Ely [gretand] con scho go and sayd, “yf þou be prophet playn, Schew now þi my?t to me and mo and gayre me haue my sun agayn! þen wyll I trewly trow þat þou be þe prophett strang. And els I say þat þou hath slayn my sun with wrang.” 925 when hely saw h[yr] sorow sere, he sayd, “dame, sese! all sal be wele.” he raysed hym þat was bun to bere fayr in forse fully to fele. þen made þe moþer mery chere and sayd, “þi god may send all sele. now wot I wele with owtyn were: þou ert his prophett trew as stele.” ffull holy þen scho hym held, as þor was schewed to sy?t. And ay whyls he þor dweld, scho esed hym at hyr my?t. 926 god be gan þe[n] to haue pete, for pepyll peryscht in mony a place. To þe prophet Ely commawnd he þem forto comforth in þis case [And say they shal have rayne plente and be releeved in litle space]. Ely was glad yt suld so be. to betell ward be lyue he gase. he had bene þore be fore; full well knew he þe strette. bot fyrst, or he com þore, sum meruels con he mete. 927 with kyng Acab [þen] wonnand was a prowd prince with armys clene, þat named was [Obedyas]. he serued god and þat was sene when prophettes and prestes to payn con pase through Iesabell, þat fellows qwene. Sum of þem helped he has þat þe same day ded suld haue bene. In h[id place] he þem sett and sayued þem fro þe chaunce And broy?t hym self in dett to fynd þem sustinance. 928 kyng Acab bad hym wend in hy to seke yf he my?t fynd herbe or grese þat þer bestes my?t lyfe þer by þat dyes for defawt, more and lese; Or yf he my?t awr spyre or spy whore þat warlow wonnand es þat proued þem by his prophecy þat þei suld dwell in swylke drynes. “To tyme he come agayn and yf þou may hym bryng, Als sone he sal be slayn, for he told swylk [tokynyng].” 929 Obedyas wold no langer lett; he was full boun all bale to bete, ffor herbys or gryse, yf he my?t gete, bot he fand nawder sawre ne swete. bot in the way, as he was sett, with þe prophett Ely con he mete. when he hym saw, for ioy he grette and fell doun flatt be fore his fete. he fraynd als man afrayd, “es þis my lord Ely?” he answerd sone and sayd, “goddes seruand here am I.” 930 “ser,” he sayd, “þus I am sent þe forto seke, os þou may see. kyng Acab hath yfyn his jugment þat for þis dry ded sall þou be, And bot I bryng þe, I be shent. þerfor sum consell ken þou me.” he says to hym, “I wold þou went and tell hym os I tell þe: styll here I sall abyd and no fote ferther flee. And say for all his pryd god sall my belder be. 931 And I sall warrand þe full wele and fro his felnes þe dyffend.” Obedias went and told ylk dele vnto Acab as Ely hym kend. he sayd, “ser, seke we for our sele and pray hym sum socur to send!” And for þe folke swylke fawtes fele, vnto hym both wyghly þei wend. þen sayd þe kyng for scorn, “ys þou not he, þat same þat gayrs my land be lorn and wastes both wyld and tame?” 932 þen sayd Ely, “ser, I þe tell: þis sorow is sent all for þi syne. Bryng same the best of israel, yf þat þou wyll þis baret blyne, And þe fals prophettes of Ie?abell and prestes and dekyns, more and myn, And comys all to þe mownt carmell! þer sall I tell þem, or I twyne, þe cause of all þis kare and what may most amend.” fforto fulfyll þis fare þe kyng full sone hath send. 933 vnto þe lordes of his land and most clene of þe comonalite, prophettes þat Ie?abell ordand, prestes and dekyn[s] in þer degre, vnto þem all [he] [þus] commawnd, “comys to þe mount of carmell with me! þore sall ?e se þe prophett stand þat mad vs in þis bale to be.” Sone on a hyll on hey?t þis pepyll was purvayde. þen Ely stud vp ry?t amang þem all and sayd, 934 “lordynges, your lyfes þus worthys to lake þat leuys þe law þat moyses lent. grett god þat to your faders spake, hym suld ?e trow with trew entent. god of abraham and of ysac, vnto his saws ?e suld assent, And leue Beall þat euer is blake, or els in bale ?e mon be brent. yf ?e may proue by skyll þat he may helpe yow oght, tell yt [þis] pepyll vntyll!” to þis þei answer noght. 935 “Now sers,” he says, “asay we sall whedder of our goddes hath more power. Rayse vp an Auter amang yow all, and I sall rayse an oþer nere. Takes þen an ox owt of a stall and part yt in sunder in peysese sere. And on your auter lettes yt fall, and I sall do þe same ry?t here. To god þen sall we pray, and qwylk so fyrst is brent, hald hym for god verray.” to þis þei all assent. 936 ffals prestes, clerkes of Ie?abell, and prophettes, iiij [C] and mo, Raysed vp an Auter þem omell, for so þei wene to wast þer wo. þei leide þeron full fayr fuell, and þen a gret ox con þei slo And layde furth both flesch and fell; and Ely dyd an oþer also. þen prestes and prophettes kneled, ylkon aftur þer state, And prayd beall forto beld, bot his comforth com late. 937 ffull rudly þen þei rope and rare on þer mawment to mend þer mode. bot þer offerand moued neuer þe mare, bot in a state full styll it stod. þei rent þer face and raue þer hare and weped for wo, ose þei ware wode. Ely stud styll on þem to stare, hym toy?t þat game was wounder gud. he says, “your god is on slepe or els went ferre fro hame. To yow he takes no [k]e[p]e, crys on hym fast for schame!” 938 so dyd þei holly half a day, to cry and rare þei wold not rest. þer offerand on þe Auter lay, and no kyns fyre wold in yt fest. þen Ely bad þem wend a way, god was not to þer prayer prest, And sayd, “for soth, I shall assay yf my god wyll be bettur gest.” his Auter and ylk dele in goddes name was agrayd. his flesch was weschen wele and on þe Auter layd. 939 On both his knese þen knelse he doun and prayd to god with stabyll steuyn To send sum segn in þat seson þat his name my?t be new to neuyn. Or he had endyd his oryson, a fyre dyscended doun fro heuyn. yt brent all vp that he mad boun and went vp into þe ayre full euyn. þen ware þo folke full fayn, and lowd þei cast A Crye: “þer is no god may gayn bot þe god of Ely! 940 we wot beall ys bot a fend, and fals prophettes, foull mot þem fall!” Ely bad þat þei suld shend prophettes and prestes þat [on hym] call. of all þe mene?e mad þ[ei] end þat gouernd hym, both gret and small. þen Ely heygh with wordes hende, “sum socur yow god send sall.” þe Ebrews went at wyll and toy?t þer werkyng wele. And Ely loged hym styll apon þe mount of carmele. 941 To god fast con he call and crye of his pepyll forto haue pyte And bad his seruand spyre and spye yf any clowd com fro þe see. At last he sayd, “ser, certanly þe Ayre be gynys all brown to bee.” god send helpe þen sone in hy: Rayn fell ouer all þat cuntre. þen loue þei god all ways with wyll, word and dede. And þe prophett þei prays þat so spake for þer sped. 942 bot Ie?abell, þat cursed qwene, when scho herd tell of þis tythyng, how all þat had with beall bene ware ded and thrugh Ely demyng, þen in hert scho had grett tene and sayd þer suld non erthly thyng Saue hym, and he my?t be sene, þat he ne suld haue þe same endyng. Ely herd hyr swere swa; þerfor fast con he flee Tyll a Cyte of Iuda, þat named was barsabe. 943 lang soiornyng þer saw he none, for he was ferre from ylka frend. To wyldernese he went alone, and in a loge þer con he lend. To my?ty god he mad his mone and prayd hym þat he my?t make end, “Als myn elders ar ded ylkon, lord, suffer me þat way to wend! Sene þem no lyffe ys lent þat wore more of wrschepe, lett me wend os þei went!” with thys he fell on slepe. 944 he was wery and my?t not wake, for he had wentt be ways sere. An Angell [come and] to hym sp[a]ke and sayd he was goddes messyngere. Mete and drynke he bad hym take so forto hold hym hoyle and fere. þen at his hed he fand a cake and a vessell with watur clere. And for hym fayled fode, of þat fayre was he fayn. he ete and dyd hym gud, and sone he sleped agayn. 945 The secund [tyme] þe Angell sayd, “wake, wake, Ely, and no more þou wynke! Swylke ose ys in þis place purvayd god byddes þat þou sall ete and drynke. A grett way is be fore þe grayd þat þe behoues both swett and swynke.” he rayse and rathly hym arayd. his lymys ware þen full ly?t, hym thynke. by the my?t of þat same mete he trayueld fawrty days þe hyll of god to gett, heyght Oreb þe story says. 946 god spake to hym in þat space and sayd, “what sterd þe into þis stede?” he sayd, “lord, for ferd of my fase. for and I byd, I ete neuer bred. þi prophettes in euere ylk place by Ie?abell ar putt to ded, And þe same to me heyght scho has. þat dose me flee fro hyr hatred.” god sayd, “go ydder agayn and do message of myne!

So same we lett þem dwell, two gud seruandes to go[d], And of kyng Acab tell and of his neghtbour, nabod. 949 kyng Acab wuned in [Ie?e]rael, A Cyte þat was long and wyd. And also his qwenne Ie?abell was wonnand þore with mekyll pryd. And þis Nabod þat I of tell soiornd als A neghtbour nere be syd. he had a feld þat to hym fell whore wynes full mekyll multyplyd. þe kyng oft yt beheld, for yt was large and lang. he thynkes to haue þat feld awder by ry?t or wrang. 950 And to fullfyll þis purpase playn to Nabod sent he message þore. To by hys feld he wold be bayn And to gyf gud fully þerfore. bot Nabod sent hym word agayn þat yt fell to his ayrys euer more. he wold noy?t sell yt for certayn. þen was þe kyng greued full sore. so grett dyspytt hym thynke, his hert he my?t not meke. he my?t nawder ete ne drynke bo[t] layd hym doun sore seke. 951 no sang, ne solace my?t hym saue, ne no helpyng to hym a vayld. Qwene Ie?abell þe cause con craue and asked hym hertly what hym ayled. he sayd, “for nabod feld I craue, and þer of haue I fowly fayled.” Scho says, “þat hette I þe to haue, all be yt neuer so trewly tayled.” Scho gart hyr rebels ryse þat tyll hyr bode was bayn, And charged þem on all wyse þat nabod sone ware slayn. 952 Scho bad þat þei suld bere hym on hand þat he had sclaunderd god of heuyn, And lett hym so no langer stand. And at hyr wyll þei went full euyn. þei wold noy?t fyne or þei hym fand, and þen þei wold not here his steuyn, bot slow þat lele man for his land. þis was a cursed note to neuyn. when þis yll ded was done, þe kyng was hole, hym toy?t. Bot god sent message sone þat sayd yt suld [sore be] boy?t. 953 Gud ely to þe kyng con tell, “for þou hath wroy?t þies werkes wode, In þat same feld þat Nabod fell sall þou be slayn for all þi gud. wyld bestes sall with þi body mell, and þi flesch sal be fowles fud. And say to þi wyfe Ie?abell in þis Cyte sall houndes lape hyr blud. Als kyng Ieroboam kyn dyed all with outt bereyng, So þi frendes for þi syn sall fall to fole endyng.” 954 kyng Acab þen was cast in care. to god fast con he call and crye And heyght þat he suld neuer mare werke to wrath hym wylfully, so þat he wold of vengance spare and of his synys þen haue mercy. And when god saw his sorows sare, a gayn to hym he sent [ely]. he says his kynred sall be saued whyls he has my?t, bot all ellys suld be fall as he be fore had hey?t. 955 þe prophett þen his way is went whore god wold gouerne hym to gang. þe kyng þen toke full gud tent what tales ware þore þem amang. And Ie?abell, þat lady gent, was euer in wyll to werke wrang. In grett lykyng now ar þei lent; we sall leue þat yt lastes not lang. The kyng of Syre, benedab, with kynges thryty and two soyght vnto kyng Acab with were to werke hym wo. 956 when kyng Acab persaued in hy how enmys enturd in tyll his land, And wyst with swylke a cumpany to fy?t in feld no folke he fand, he clossed hym self in samary; was full wele walled hym to warrand. bot benedab sett not þer by; þer my?t no strengh agayns hym stand. þat Cyte large and wyd, þat semly was to see, Seged he on ylka syd with paynyms grett plente. 957 Vnto kyng Acab word he send, “yf þat þou wyll take me vntyll both wyues and chylder in to myn hend, at my lyst forto spare or spyll, And all þat is for thresour kend with in þe Cyte, lowd and styll, To haue with me, þen wyll I wend.” kyng Acab answerd to þat skyll, “Of myn all [þat] men kens wyll I lefe forto lyfe. bot gudes of oþer mens haue I no ry?t to gyfe.” 958 kyng benedab þen was not payd; þerfor he answerd wordes fell. “I haue here sembled men,” he sayd, “so mony þat yf I þem omell ylkon a handfull had puruayd of erthe to lay here whore we dwell, Of þat same [erthe] suld be grayd A hyll os hegh os a castell. And fare þei sall not fare or all þis burgh be brent.” þen kyng Acab had care, bot socour sone was sent. 959 god to his helpyng has tane hede and send his prophett hastely. he sayd, “kyng Acab, haue no dred! god says þou sall haue vyctory.” þe kyng askys, “who sall do þat ded?” he says, “chylder and [no] chyualry.” þen gart [þe] kyng geydder full gud sped of chylder a full fayre cumpany, Swylke os my?t wepyns weld IIII C furth he fand. þei wentt be fore to þe feld. he sued with VII thowssand. 960 þei musterd þem with my?t and mayn; god mayntend all þat mene?e. þe paynyms sone ware put to payn, all ware þai neuer so grett plente. V M sone of þem ware slayn, and all þe remnand fayn to flee. bot sone þei sembled mo agayn and sayd þat þei suld venged bee. kyng benedab asked consell what thyng þat most my?t noye, And what my?t most avayle þe Ebrews forto dystroye. 961 þei answerd sone vnto his saw and sayd, “for þis fare þat þou frayns Condicion of þer god we knaw. his helpe is all in hegh mountayns. þerfor to dales I red we draw, for þer our god most to vs gayns.

A paynym spened a spere and stert to hym þat stownd. Thurght þe body he con hym bere and gaf hym dedes wound. 983 when kyng Acab doun was cast, his men ware bayn hym forto beld And hamward hyed þem [with] hym full fast whyls he my?t any wyttes weld. with mekyll payn so are þe past to þei come euyn in Nabod feld. þen my?t his lyf no langer last, bot þer þe gast behoued hym ?eld.

And as þe pepyll [prayd] with word, wyll and toy?t, A prophett come and sayd, “Kyng Iosaphat, dred þe noy?t!” 989 þen was kyng Iosaphat full fayn when he had swylke hertyng fro heuyn. he sembled men with all his mayn and comforth þem wele with his steuyn.

And yf þe fader a foyle war fun, þe sun was more fole, and þat he feld. To make hym god[es] he has begun, os paynyms vsed in ?owth and eld. To gud god wold he not be bun, bot belsabub he made his beld, was god of acaron, A nacion not to neuyn. hys hope was all hym on. he toke no hed to heuyn. 995 So lang in lust his lyfe he lede hym lyst to lere no lefull layre. þe dome of god no thyng he dred, bot euer he dyd myse more and more. ffro a hegh sted—þor was he sted— he fell and hurt hym self full sore so þat he lay seke in his bed, and fast þus ordand he þerfore: his messyngers he send to belsabub at wytt whedder his seknes suld mend, or he suld dy on yt. 996 And als þei went, be for fand þei þe prophett Ely in a playn. he asked wheder þei ware on way, and þei sayd hym þe soth certayn All how þer lord in langur lay. he bad þem boldly turn agayn: “And to your lord salfly ?e say: of þis seknes he sall be slayn, by cause he hopes his hele of belsabub forto haue And leue[s] hym þat is lele and all seknes may saue.” 997 þe messyngers agayn con wend þis bodword boldly forto bere. þei told hym all þat tale tyll end as þei with Ely warned were. þen was kyng occo?i yll tend; full grett othes þen con he swere Old Ely with shame forto shend so þat [his] demyng suld noy?t dere.

And þat god is with me wele payd, ensampyll here sone sall þou see. þou sall be brent for all þi brayd and all þis cowrt þat come with þe.” By þis word was end, god wold do hys desyre. A fyre from heuyn dyscend and brent þem bone and lyre. 1000 vnto þe kyng com non of þo to tell hym how þis werke was wroy?t. bot when he wyst, he was full wo and sayd yt suld be full dere boy?t. he ordand men ose mony moo and bad þe prophett suld be broy?t. bot þei ware ry?t sone serued so as þe fyrst fyfty þat hym soy?t. þei ware brent ylkon with fyre þat on þem fest. þen was þe kyng wyll of woyne; he wyst not what was best. 1001 þore in þat Cyte wonned a man þat moyses law wold neuer lett. The kyng to hym commawnd þen þe prophett with fayrnes to fett. he went and warly to hym wan with in his sell whore he was sett. As curtasly ose euer he can and with grett gladnes he hym grett And sayd, “ser, haue mercy on me and my mene?e!” þen to hym sayd Ely, “what is þi wyll with me?” 1002 “A, ser,” he says, “full wele I knaw god gouerence þe in word and dede. we ar charged with full grett aw vnto þe kyng þe forto lede. And þou wyll se tyll our saw, so may þou make vs mekyll mede; And yf þou wyll not ydder draw, [we] mun be ded with outyn drede. [w]e sall noy?t do ne say in þis gate þe to greue.

The kyng thynkes loth to lose his rent, wher his fader was fest be fore. vnto ierusalem has he sent to Iosaphat, þat was kyng þore, And prayd hym forto take entent and help his ry?t forto restore. Iosaphat says, “I sall helpe all þat euer I may.” And same so went þei all in full ryall aray. 1008 Bot qwen þe gayre was gudly grayd [and] þei all redy forto ryde, kyng Ioram þen þe prophett prayd forto tell þem what suld be tyde.

Euery on had plente þen þat be for had ry?t noy?t. 1090 No ferly yf þo folke ware fayn, and þei thanked god, os was worthy. And als þei enturd in a gayn in to þe Cyte of samary, þe man þat sayd, bot god yt rayn, þer mete suld neuer so multyply, Euyn in þe entryng was he slayn. so was fulfylled þe prophecy Qwylk Elysew by word wroy?t, þat sayd he suld yt se, bot for he trowd yt noy?t, no help þer of had he. 1091 heyre may we fynd by fygur fayre exsempyll schewd to our sy?t þat no man suld be in dyspare of goddes mercy, ne of his my?t. for als he made both erth and Ayre and with his word all wardly wy?t, So is his my?t to [amend] or payre aftur þer wyll is wrang or ry?t. who in dyspare makes end so fro all fayth to fayle, þei fayr furth with þe fend to byde euer in his bayle. 1092 þis case was kend by cursed Iudas, qwylke sold his lord þat all may saue. he trowd not trew for þat trespase, þerfor he wold no mercy craue. he was so sett with Satanas þat with a cord þat cursed knaue hanged hym self, and so he has his home in hell and euer sall haue. what syn so we haue done, yf we to trowth wyll tent, god wyll forgyf als sone as we wyll ry?t repent. 1093 Also we may exempyll se and by swylke case haue knawyng clere: All yf our self so synfull be þat god wyll not our prayers here, Of holy men þen here wyll he þat for vs profers þer prayer. þen is yt gud wysdome þat we send our saynges by sanctes sere And speke, whyls we haue space, to þem we wott are wyse, Of god to gett vs grace sone of our syns to ryse. 1094 þe fend is qwaynt vs fort[o] qwell bot yf we lefe his lare lyghtly. ffor and we in his Donger dwell, he makes our myse to multyply, As yt with Iudas fyrst be fell. for he mystrest in goddes mercy, he hanged hym self and is in hell with wo, as his werke was worthy. God graunt vs spech and space sone [to for] sake our syne, And so to gete his grace þat we to welth may wyne! 1095 Now forþi[r] of þis same to see our process playnly to declare: kyng benedab com to his cuntre and herd tell of þis ferly fare, how four messell mad hym to flee and all wyght men þat with hym ware. Swylk schame þer in his hert had he no comforth my?t [hym couer] of care. ffor he so fayntly fled and lefed all in þat sted, he lay seke in his bede in dowt forto be ded. 1096 with no kyns medcyns wold he mell, so was [h]e Angr[ed] in wardly. he cald a prince heygh A?abell, and bad hym take tressour and cumpany, And wend furth fast, for nothyng dwell, vnto þat Cyte of Samary, And pray þe prophett hym forto tell whedder he sall lyfe or dy. þe prince þe cuntre knew; he went, and sone he fand þe prophett Elysew and proferd hym [his] presand. 1097 “Syr, þe kyng of syry certayn is seke, and hydder he hath me send To wytt sum certayn of his payn, wedder yt sall sesse or sone make end. he prays þe take þis presand playn.” þe prophett says, “þat may not me amend. Bot haue yt home with þe agayn and say hym als þou sall be kend. lere hym þat he sall lyfe and in þat poynt hym plese; Els may þ[ou] mater gyf to do hym more dysese. 1098 Bot hardely I to þe hete: with in few days his ded is nere.” þe prophett þen be gan to grete and forto mon and make yll chere. when A?aell saw hym so lete, þe cause full fast he con enquere. he sayd, “for þou sall make þe mete to wayte Ebrews with sorow[s] sere.” A?aell answerd ry?t, “þat ded I wyll deny. I am no man of my?t forto make swylke maystry.” 1099 The prophett hert was heuy os led. he sayd, “in þi self [þ]is I se. þe kyng of syry sall sone be ded, in lyfe no langer last sall he. And þou sall stand furth in his sted as crownd kyng of þat cuntre. þen sall þou werke by weked red and stroy þis reme, þat rewys me. bot I am fayn for why I sall noy?t se þat sy?t. ffor of grett eld am I, me fayles both mynd and my?t.” 1100 þe prince agayn his gate has grayd als glad a man as he may gang. vnto þe kyng of Syry he sayd, “ser, þou sall fare well and wax strang.” Bot yll lechyng for hym he layd so þat his lyf last not lang, And with þe paynyms so he purvayd þat he was mad kyng þem amang. he [rewled] þem so in rest and mad þer myrthes more. þei sayd he was þe best of all þat [had] bene before. 1101 Now lefe we þis a?aell þat kyng of syre hym self con ma, And Ioram, kyng of israel; a lytyll [tyme] we lefe þem twa. of þat oþer Ioram wyll we tell, kyng of ierusalem and of Iuda. he wedded þe doyghtur of Ie?abell and kyng Acab doyghtur alswa. hyr name was godole, als clerkes may clerly knaw.

Sant Elysew vnto hym sent a byll þat his maystur had made. Ely, whyls he in land was lent, mad prophecy in bokes brad, And of þis mater þen he ment to bye, all yf yt long abad. ffor all behoued be done, poyntes of þer prophecys, Auder sythyn or sone. þe wrytt was on þis wyse:— 1104 Ioram, for þou has left þe law þat moyses in his lyf con lere, And vnto dewlys þi dedes [doos] draw and of heuyn has no hast to here, And for þou has kylled, as we knaw, þi broþer and þi dukes dere, her is assygned in þis saw ho[w] þou sall suffer sorows sere.

And so sall þou make end with wo, as ys worthy.— All þis care was contened with poyntes of prophecy. 1106 And for all suld wurth on swylke wyse as god by prophettes purvayd has, with Ethyopes and Arabyse sone all his wyfes vn wrschept was. And all his suns with doles dyes bot one, þe eldest, occo?ias. hym self royted and my?t not ryse, with hydows payn so con he pase. ffor vnlafull lyfyng þus was his endyng vyle. þen Occo?i was kyng, bot he le[s]t lytyll whyle. 1107 Now lefe we þe kyng occo?i. of oþer Ioram wyll we tell þat soyiornd kyng in samary and led þat land of israel. he geydderd hym grett cumpany with kyng benedab more forto mell, By cause he had wun with maystry Ramatha and þor con he dwell. Ioram wold wyn a gayn þat Cyte yf he my?t; Bot his werke was in vayn, þat boldenese dere he boy?t. 1108 To ramatha he con persew and seged yt on ylka syd. And sone þer had he note all new, with a dart a wound full wyde. he feled yt so [þat] few yt knew, bot þer he my?t no langer byde. he [h]ad A steward þat hey?gh Iew, to hym he toke his ost þat tyd. he went to [Ie?erael] softly, for he was sare. þore wonned qwene Ie?abell, his moyder we ment of Are. 1109 with hyr with lechyng þor he lay, for nerre home he my?t not pase. kyng occo?i, his cosyn, herd say how þat his Eme yll wounded was. he ordand hym full rych aray of hors and harnes þat he has.

[S]o soiorn þei in fere with Ie?abell, þe qwene. ffull sone þer sall þei here þat sall turn þem to tene. 1110 The nobyll prophett Elysew, als god ordand þem two omell, he sent an oþer prophet trew and bad hym go and tythynges tell Vnto þe dughty duke [ser] Iew in þe ost whore he can dwell, And þat he suld anoynt hym new forto be kyng of israel. “Say god hath ordand so þat he þat forse sall fell And venge hym on þem two Ioram and Ie?abell.” 1111 And bad hym stroy vp all þe kyn of kyng acab in elka eld, ffor he to Nabot dyd grett syne þat slogh hym falsly for his feld. And Iesabell gart all be gyn, And sythyn scho gart with spere and [s]cheld A C prophettes lyfes to twyn for all þe welth þat þei had in weld. þe prophett went to Iew and told hym all þis chaunce, how þe prophett Elysew bad hym go take vengance. 1112 And when he had sayd his errand be twyx þem two full preuely, þore he anoynt hym with his hand and cald hym kyng of samary And of all els in israel land, and þen he wendes his way in hy. þe pepyll asked to vnderstand what þis sendyng suld sygnyfye. þe duke told þem tythyng how Ioram suld be ded, And how he suld be kyng and stand furth in his sted. 1113 þen was grett myrth to see þem mete, so wylly to þat warke þei wore. þei spred þer cloghes be for his fete and raysed hym kyng, ose fell þerfor, And holy vnto hym þei hete to be his men for euer more. And þen þei gate þe gaynest strett to Ie?arell, for Ioram was þore. when kyng Ioram hard say hys ost com on swylke a wyse, he wend full wele þat þei had ouer comyn his enmyse. 1114 And þerfor was he ferly fayn. all yf his [wound] werkyd hym yll, he rayse and went duke Iew agayn to welcom hym with word and wyll. Tyll Nabod feld he passed playn, and in þat sted þen stod he styll, And with A dart þor was he slayn þe propfecy to fulfyll. Lyke to his fader be fore, forto venge Nabod blod hys body left þei þore to bestes and foules fod. 1115 kyng occo?i, his cosyn, saw how þat his eme to ded was dy?t. þerfor on dregh he con hym draw and ordand hym full fast to fly?t. bot als he rayd furth by a raw, þe dukes me[n] of hym had sy?t, And to hym t[h]rast þei in a thraw so þat he lost his lyues ly?t. hys men his body bare to ierusalem Cyte. þat comyng was grett care to his moyder godole. 1116 Duke Iew with his clene cumpany enturd þe cyte of Ie[?]eraell. “welcom, our kyng!” the folke con crye and mad hym homeg þem omell. All þis was care and con[t]rarye vnto þe fals quene Ie?abell. To a hygh tour con scho hy, and þore scho cast out wordes fell. Scho cryd to þe duke, “ser Iew,” and oft scho con record, “þ[ou] fals traytur vn trew sakles hath slayn þi lord.” 1117 Scho wered hym with wordes kene. he spyrd who spake þo wordes bold. þei sayd, “ser, Ie?abell, þe quene, kyng acab wyf ?e knaw of old.” þen at hyr wordes he was full tene. he bad [tw]o men þat wyghtly wold, “Go cast hyr down yow two be twene, so sall hyr sayng sowr be sold.” To þat werke ware þei prest and hasted þem full fast. Ouer the wall þei hyr kest þat all hyr bowels brast. 1118 þe duke was sett in Ioram se, resauyd with alkyns reuerence ryfe. þei mad grett fest with mekyll gle, and all þei loue god o[f] his lyfe.

[T]o bereyng was noy?t gettyn bo[t] nayles and banes bare. 1119 kyng Iew þen cald his princese of price and sayd, “sers, loke ?e meruell noy?t þat I haue wroy?t now in þis wyse, both kyng and qwene tyll end broy?t. þis is for nokyns couetyse, þat sall ?e wyt wele in your toy?t. bot god in whom all lordschep lyse, he wold þat vengance suld be soy?t ffor Nabod, þat nobyll man, þat was slayn for his feld. ffor sant Elysew sayd þen bestes suld þer bodes weld.” 1120 þen answere all þat folke in fere, “ser, of þis fare ar we full fayn. ffor s[e]n god wold þat yt so were, no gud man suld say þor agayn.” þen sent he folke [both] fere and nere to seke on ylka syd certayn kyng acab kynred to conquere. þei sessyd not or all ware slayn. both man and chyld and wyfe full wyghtly had þer wage. þei left not on on lyfe þat langed to þat lynage. 1121 To hym was told þen preuely þat þer was sexty chylder ?yng, Kyng acab suns, in samary to soyiorn þore in saue kepyng. And to þat Cyte he sent [for thy] and bad men suld byd for no thyng bot stryk of all þer hedes in hy and vnto hym belyue þem bryng.

And all by a sotell sleght ordand he yt suld be. he gart cry all on heght throught owt all þat cuntre 1123 þat he wold make þor sacrafyce to beall, þat was god of tyre. And all þat wold werke on þat wyse he sayd suld haue his helpe to hyre. þe fals prophettes full fast con ryse, to do þat ded was þer desyre.

All þat was lost be fore, both Cytes, town and toure, by strengh he con restore and gate full grett honoure. 1147 The kyng of ierusalem amasy, A herdy man of hert and hand, Toyght he wold haue þe maystry of hethyn folke whore he þe[m] fand. he sembled sone grett cumpany of harnest men XXX thowssand, And to kyng Ioas of samary sent he a full fayr presand Of syluer and of gold, A thowsand besandes bry?t, And prayd hym þat he wold help hym with folke to fy?t. 1148 Kyng Ioas was of þis presand payd. þerfor be lyue to hym he lent A M men ry?t wele arayd to wend with hym whor so he went. And when þei ware full redy grad, god told kyng Ama?i his entent: þe folke þat kyng Ioas had purvayd, he bad þei suld agayn be sent. ffor and þei with hym ?ode, he sayd yt suld be warre. “þer lyfyng is not gud, þerfore led þem no ferre.” 1149 This commawndment fro he had knawn, for he wold gare no greuance groue, þo men he dyd sone be withdrawn; þat toy?t þem was grett reproue. And furth he went þan with his awn, to Moabyse fast con he moue. he stroyd all þat was sett or sawn and gatt gold to his awn behoue More þen men my?t tell, and went home agayn. þe folk of israel þerfor ware no thyng fayn. 1150 Bot grett dyspyte þem toy?t þerby þat he had swylke hape in his hende, ffor he refused þer cumpany and wold not lett þem with hym wend. þen þis prowd kyng ama?i, when god had hym swylke socur send, he lad his lyf in lechery and in goddes law hym lyst not lend. And when prophettes hym blamed, in tene he told þem tyll þei suld be shent and shamed bot yf þei held þem styll. 1151 So hegh pride in his hert he has hym thynke no prince suld be his peyre. he sent vnto þe kyng Ioas letturs mad in þis manere þat he and all þat with hym was suld serue hym on sydes sere; Or els with playn ware wold he pas hym and his kyndome to conquere. kyng Ioas sent agayn he was noy?t ferd þerfore; yf he ware mekyll of mayn, he sayd goddes my?t was more. 1152 To tell of all þer toyle þat tyd wold take long tym or all ware told. kyng Ama?i for his grett pride was putt to myschef mony fold. how he had herme, is not to hyde, when kyng Ioas had hym in hold. his awn men gatt hym so on syd þat he was kylled with cares cold. þei broy?t hym to bereyng in ierusalem wrscheply, And after hym was kyng his sun þat hey?t O?i. 1153 Sone aftur þis þe kyng Ioas dyed in þe Cyte of samary. Ieroboam, his sun, þan was kyng crowned of þat cumpany. vnto hym come a prophett Ionas and told to hym by prophecy Agayns þe kyng of Syre to pase, for sone he suld haue vyctory. he ordand hym and ?ode with baytell ry?t arayd, And all was done in dede euyn als þe prophet sayd. 1154 Now in þis tym is forto tell how god to men musters his my?t, And of grett ferlys þat befell to þis prophet þat Ionas hy?t, And how god vnto hym con tell of Niniue þat day and ny?t vnto his resons ware rebell. and for he wold rewle þem ry?t, he bad Ionas go preche to þo men euyn and morn And his law to þem teche so þat þei ware noy?t lorn. 1155 Ionas herd tell of Nynyue and of þe folke so fell þei wore And yll doers in all degre, þerfor he dred [hym] to come þore. he gate hym schypmen ouer þe se and ordand hym full fast þ[erf]ore In sum fere cuntre forto be, þat god and he suld mete no more. þis was a foull foly when he so fondly dyd. god ys euer all my?ty, from h[ym] may noy?t be hyd. 1156 with maryners full sone he mett þat sayd þei suld sayle to Cecile. Gud hyre to haue þore he þem hett to helpe hym to þat vncouth yle. bot in þe se when þei ware sett and fro þe land full mony a myle, Swylke stormes blew and on þem bett þei wened to be lorn in lytyll whyle. þe merchandes þem amang cast owt þe ryches fele, Bot þe storme was so strang þei had no hope of hele. 1157 So when þei ware þus stratly sted in poynt þat perell neuer to pase, þei kest lotes als þer counsel red, and sone þe lote fell on Ionas. þei layted whore he lay on a bed, and asked hym what he done has. he sayd, “fro god þus am I fled, and all þis wo for me yt was. I knaw to god my gylt and all my weked toy?t. bettur ys þat I be spylt þen þo þat trespast noy?t.” 1158 when þei þis herd, þei had pyte þat his lyf suld no langer last. bot for yt my?t no bettur be, in to þe se þei haue hym cast. þen sayled þei fast to þer cuntre, and fro all perels are þei past. And with A whalle sone hent was he þat nawder flesch ne bon brast. Thre days and III nyghtes was he with in þat whalle. So con god schew his myghtes a pon his frendes to fall. 1159 when III days and III nyghtes ware gone, þat fysch vnto þe banke hym broy?t And in þat land leued hym alon whylke god bad fyrst he suld haue soy?t. with mornyng þen he mad his mone and wyst he had vn wysly wroy?t. An oþer tyme god hath hym tone and told vnto hym eft his toy?t: “wende vnto Nynyue and tell to more and myn: both þei and þer Cyte sall synke down for þer syne 1160 In XL days bot yf þei pray and do swylke penance as to me pays.” þe[n] Ionas went wyghtly his way, he durst no langer make d[e]lese. þat Cyte was, als we here say, so mekyll and so wyde of ways þat vnethes any man þat may a fote pase thrugh yt [in] thre days. Ionas enturd with in, als god had hym purvayd. To preche con he be gyn and þus to þem he sayd, 1161 “your sauyour þus has me send to warn yow how his wylles wore: 'bot yf ye wyll your myse amend and graunt to greue your god no more, Or XL days ben comyn tyll end, sall ?e haue sorows sere and sore. To hell your Cyte sall dyscend, als oþer fyfe hath done be fore. þei vsed vn kyndly syn, als ?e werke now all ways. be lyue bot yf ?e blyn, your Cyte synkes,’ he says.” 1162 Sone all þo folke of nynyuie, qwen þei herd of þis carfull cry, graunt þer gylt with grett pety and mekly asked of god mercy. And þe kyng of þat same Cyte, þe qwene and all þer cumpany laft all þer ray of ryalte, and sekes and hayres þei hent in hy. And so cled sat þei down full low both more and lese, And cast powder ouer þer croun in maner of meknese. 1163 when þei ware þen þus stratly sted, þe kyng gart be his commawndment þat all folk [suld in sekkes] be cled and to mete suld þei take no tent. ?yng barns also suld not be fed bot þat þe lyf [ware] in þem lent, Nore bestes also suld not be led to fude or faurty days ware went, So þat both man and best suld pray and fast fro mete Of syns to be releschest and forgyfnes to gete. 1164 when god saw þem so benly bow and do his bedyng bowsomly And holly hey?t in hym to trow and for sake all þer mawmentry, þer lyfyng þen he con a low and graunt þem grace and gud mercy. þis schewys to vus all holly how all sall haue welth þat are worthy. As þe prophet Ionas was III days in þe se, So cryst in erthe here was bered be days thre. 1165 þen stalked he fro þat Cyte styll, and þe pepyll fast with penance prayd. he luged hym hey?t vnder a hyll to se what suld be aftur grayd. And ay he loked þat Cyte vntyll when yt suld synke, os he had sayd. And for yt stud, hym angerd yll, bot god was of þer penance payd. And þayr prayer hym plessed, þerfor had þei þer boune. Ionas was yll dysplessed with hete of þe sun full sone, 1166 Als yt in somer seson is sene. bot god, þat [sone may] send all seele, he mad an y[v]yn grofe grene, þat vmbrayd hym euer ylk dele. So sat he styll two hyllys be twen; þat all suld wast, he wend full wele. And to hym self he sayd in tene, “þis fayr is fals, fully I fele.” Bot on þe morn be prime þen wex his meruell more. þe son was clere þat tyme, and þe [y]uyn was noy?t þore. 1167 þen had he tene for þat þe tre was so a way went on þat ny?t. God sayd to hym, “why greues þou þe for thyng þat is not in þi my?t? Me lykes to sayue now Nyniue be cause þei ar repentand ry?t.” þen sayd he, “lord, haue mynd of me þat I my?t sone to ded be dy?t And fro þis lyfe be reft!” þus leue [we] of þer [th]ynges And tell furth whore we left to end þe boke of kynges. 1168 kyng I[e]roboam [we told of] be fore of israel and of samary, he dyed when he my?t lyf no more, when faurty ?eres ware gone fully. And in his sted was crowned þor his eldest sun hey?t ?acary. hym wyll we lefe now styll in store and ca[r]pe furth of kyng O?i. Ierusalem and Iuda be gane he to gouerne wele. Bot sythyn he fayled þer fra with foly, þat con he fele. 1169 Ay whyls he was a nobyll man, all had daynteth with hym to dele. he wered on sarsyns and so wan grett wrschep and grett werdly wele. To by and byg fast he be gan borows fayre and cetys fele, And wele lufed was he þan ay whyls he was of lyuyng lele. godes tempyll ry?t he arayd and mad gret cost þer on, Euyn as yt was purvayd in tyme of salamon. 1170 he was chefe of all cheualry whore so he come in all cuntre. On mold was no man so my?ty, ne none so grett of gold ne fee. So was he sett in [surquidry] he held non half so gud os he. þerfor he fell in fond foly and past all ouer his awn degre. þe jews vsed ylk ?ere to make a fest of price And hald þat day full dere with solempne sacrafyce. 1171 And so be fell on þat same day kyng O?i wyll no langer byd. Into þe tempyll he toke þe way, and to þe Auter he hym hyed. he reuescht hym in ryche aray, as byschopes vsed in þat tyd. “I sall gyf sens,” þus con he say, so was he sett in pomp and prid. To þe sensurs he brayd and gaf sens full gud sped. þe prestes ware not apayd and blamed hym for þat ded. 1172 “Syr kyng,” þei say, “to sayue þi grace, swylk offyce is not vnto þe. Non aw at entur in to þis place bot connand clerkes of dygnyte, As prelates þat þe power has and prestes and dekyns of degre.” vnto þer tales no tent he tas; þat boy?t he sone, all men my?t se. god toke vengance in hye and sent on hym ry?t þore þe euyll of meselry. so foule was none be fore. 1173 he was so lothly on to loke þat none had lyst with hym to lend. Bot frendes and fel[o]ws hym forsoke þem self fro seknes to dyffend. þe lordes and kny?tes þat counsell toke owt of þe Cyte hym to send. And þor he wonned with wo and woke and so in myschef mad his end, ffor he tent not to presthed ne to prelate, And putt hym self to do þat fell not for his astate. 1174 be þis ensampyll may we se, sen vengance þore so sone was sene, vs ow to honour ylke degre of holy kyrke þat kept is clene, And noy?t to wene our self þat we be worthy swylk maters to mene, Bot als þei deme in dew degre to dre[s]e our dedes on days be dene.

IV Iob 1175 Iob was a full gentyll jew, of hym is [hel]full forto [h]ere. ffor whoso his condicions knew of meknes my?t fynd maters sere. Euer in his trewth he was full trew, os men may in his lyfyng lere. he lyfed euer als a lele Ebrew, in þe land of vs he had no pere. All yf he ware to knaw full mekyll in erthly my?t, In hert he was full law and dred god day and ny?t. 1176 he honerd god in all degre and euer was dredand to do yll. ffro foyles was he freke to flee and fayn all frenchep to fulfyll. he had a wyfe both fayr and free þat redy was to werke his wyll, And VII suns semly to se and doyghturs thre full stabyll and styll. Of gold god had hym sent to mend with mony a store, Rych robys and ryall rent. myrth my?t no man haue more. 1177 he had hym self VII M schepe in flokkes to flytt both to and fro, Thre thowsand camels forto kepe, and V C asses also. he had in hyllys and daylys depe fyfty yoke of oxyn in ylkon two And seruantes wele to wake and slepe in dyuerse werkes with þem to go. ffor plowes he had plente his land to dele and dy?t. In all þe Est cuntre was non so mekyll of my?t. 1178 All yf he regned in rych aray, of his gud rewle þus men may red: he lyfed full lelly in his lay and to grefe god he had grett dred. his VII suns, als I herd say, mad ryall festes þer frendes to fede Euer ylkon sere be dyuerse day, and þer III systers con þei bede þer fest so forto fyll with frendes old and ?yng. þer fader com þem tyll and gafe þem his blessyng. 1179 þe fend þat is our fals enmy to payr þem putt hym furth in prese. vnto þem had he grett enuy and care to se þem so wele encrese. he come be fore god allmighty to gette hym leue, þis is no lese, with tene to turment Iob body so forto make his solace sese. All yf our lord wele wyst of all his purpase playn, Ner þe lese ?ett als hym lyst þe fend þus con h[e] frayn: 1180 “whens comys þou, tell me in þis tyd, and whore abowt now has þou bene?” he sayd, “ser, I haue walked wyd ouer all þis werld with outyn wene So forto seke on ylka syde for syners, and sum haue I sene. þor is my bourd to gare þem byd tyll I may turment þem with tene.” God says, “takes þou no hede to Iob, my trew seruand, how he of god has dred, non lyke hym in no land? 1181 In mynd he is full meke and law, both sobour and sothfast for certayn.” þen sayd þe fend vnto þat saw, “þat Iob þe dredes ys all in vayn. þou has so clossed hym, well I knaw, þat no grefe may go hym a gayn. bot and þou wold þi hand withdraw and putt hym in my power playn, full sone þen sall þou se how he suld turn full tyte. he suld not sett be þe þe mountynance of a myte. 1182 þou makes his catell forto creue and so þou rewardes hym with ryches þat he may mene of no myschefe. what ground is þen of his gudnes?” þen sayd our lord, “I gyfe þe leue of all his mobylles more and lese; bot loke þat þou no malyce meue his body to do any dystrese. I graunt þe power playn of all his erthly gud.” þen was þe fend full fayn and fast fro god he ?ode. 1183 So when þo two ware fayre[n] in twene, þe fend sone putt furth his power. Iob chylder þen a howse with in ware bresed to ded and broy?t on bere. Sythyn all his bestes he wald not blyn to slo þem and his seruandes sere. And how þis batell all con begyn, berys wyttenese mony a messynger þat vnto Iob con tell, syghand with sympyll chere, how all þis fayre be fell. who wyll take hede may lere. 1184 ffyrst com in on, wepand with wogh, to Iob whore he in blys con byd. “þin oxin went in wayn and plogh, þin asses pasturd þem be syd. Com folk fro Saba and þeyn þem drogh and slogh þin hyne, is not to hyd. I wan a way with noy enogh to tell þe tythynges in þis tyd.” vn ethes had he þus sayd when an oþer com in with a full balfull brayd, and þus he con begyn. 1185 “A, ser,” he sayd, “[to me] take tent, for I may tell of mekyll tene. þi sheperds and þi shepe ar shent, and all þer welth is wastyd clene. A sodan fyre was on þem sent, so brym be fore had neuer bene. To bare bones all ar þei brent, bot I þat was not nere þem sene, I com þe forto tell how all þis tene be tyd.” þen langer he wold not dwell, bot sone com in the thryd. 1186 “ser,” he sayd, “our yll enmyse, þe caldews, þat we euer hath dryd, þei come with thre grett cumpanys of men of armys in yrne cled. þe camels all with outyn price haue þei tone and furth with þem led, And sloyn þi seruantes in þe sam wyse bot me allon, þat fro þem fled. I was full fayn to fle and sythyn full fast to go hyder at tell to þe of all þis were and wo.” 1187 The ferth com þe[n] with febyll chere, þe hardest hap in hand had he. “Alas,” he sayd, “for sorows sere, þat I suld euer sych [s]yghtys [s]e! þi seuyn suns and thre doyghturs dere ar ded, þerfor full wo is me. I sall þe say on what manere, for now þer may no mendes be. þei spake in certayn space to ete and drynke to geydder In þe eldest broþer place, and ylkon come þei ydder. 1188 And als þei ware with in þe wonys, sett at þer fest full fayr and fast, A wynd com on þem grett for þe noyns and all þe howse sone down yt cast. yt bressed þe barns both flesch and bons so þat þei my?t no langer last. I fled and was full wyll of wons tyll I was fro þe perels past. And, ser, sen þus is kend, I red yow werke als wyse. grett mornyng may not amend wher no relefe may ryse.” 1189 when Iob had herd of all þis care and saw yt my?t no bettur be, his sorows ware so sere and sare þat non for syte may on hym see. he rafe his cott and rent his hare, swylke heuenes in hert had he. ffull well he wyst þo werkkes ware of þe fend and of his fals mene?e. Down on his knese he kneled full low by hym alon, And to heuyn he be held, and þus he made his mone: 1190 “lord god,” he sayd, “mekyll is þi my?t amang man kynd here forto knaw, þat rewls all thyng be reson ry?t þi ryalte forto rede by raw. þou dos noþer be day ne ny?t bot dewly euynhede, os þe aw. þou ponysch men here for þer ply?t at lern þem forto luf þin law. þou kens me curtasly of my defawtes be fore.

Now se I welle þi wyll yt es þat fare [no] ferther to fulfyll. blessed þou be with more and lese! I loue þ[i] layn both lowd and styll.” when all þis werke was wroy?t, als men full ry?t may rede, þat Iob ?it trespast noy?t noþer in word ne dede. 1192 Bot when þe fend saw for certayn þat Iob wold not vn bowsom be, he hyde hym fast to god agayn to g[r]eue hym in gretter degre. Bot god þan to reproue hym playn sayd, “satanas, now may þou se þat Iob dredes me not all in vayn bot in lele luf and charite. All wo þat þou hath wroght both to hym and hys hyne, þou may not chaunge his toy?t to skyft fro me and myne.” 1193 þen sayd þe fend, “for all þis fare wyll he [not] waynd in warld to wend. ffor catell wyll he haue no care, he trows his frend wyll hym dyffend. Bot wold þou towch his body bare and suffer seknes on hym be send, so suld þou wytt yf þat he ware lele lastand in þi law to lend.” god sayd, “I gyfe þe leue of his body all be dene. Bot luke þat þou not greue his sawle bot kepe yt clene.” 1194 þe fend was þen full fayn [forþy] þat he of Iob had swylk powste. he mared hym sone with meselry, fro hed to fote no thyng was fre, Bot blayns and bledders all his body and scabbes whor skyn was wonnt to be. So satt he syghand sorely, grett sorow yt was þat syght to se. All folke þen hym forsoke þat was his frend be fore. Men lathed on hym to loke and ylk day more and more. 1195 The fend more care vnto hym cast to make hym wake and wyll of wone. Thys blayns and bleders bolnd and brast and mad þe flesch flytt fro þe bone. his seruandes, þat be fore ware fast, ware fayn to fle and leued none. bo[t] so he was kest at þe last in a mydyng sett [allone]. he þat no man wold greue be for for his ryches, now was muke most his releue forto inforse his flesch. 1196 he had no howse in forto dwell, ne cloghes for cold his [cors] to hyde, bot in þat mydyng muke omell þor was his toure als for his tyd. with A pott scarth or with a schell he scraped þe scabys on ylka syde. ffor yll Are [and] vnhonest smell þer wold non buske with hym to byde. bot in all his myschefe full trew was his trowyng þat god suld hym rele[ue] and ow[t] of bale hym bryng. 1197 So os he rested in yll aray, his wyf turment hym more to teyne. “now may men se,” þus con scho say, “of what condycions þou hath bene. blyse god and dy and wend þi way, for oþer welthys is none to wene. þou has not plessed þi god to pay, þat is wele by þi sorow sene.” “Alas,” he sayd, “for dole, why frays þou me with flytt? þou spekes euyn als a foyle þat hath no womans wytt. 1198 þier wordes þou werkes, we may warrand, þei are not rewled by ry?t ne skyll.

To bale or blyse wheder we be broy?t, to goddes bedyng we suld be bayn.” In all þer tales Iob trespast noy?t, ne spyd to spend his spech in vayn. So, als he lothly lendes alon in low degre, Thre of his faythfull frendes soght fere his syte to se. 1200 þei come ylkon fro dyuerse place, now wyll we here how þat þei heyght: Elyphath and baladach toke þat trace, and Sothar soy?t to se þat sy?t. ffor ylkon spake in dyuerse space, so sall we wytt þer resons ry?t. Bot when þei come be fore his face, to mell with mowth had þei no my?t. þei saw his syte so sad, for bale þer hertes my?t breke. þei ware so mased and mad, A word þei my?t not speke. 1201 Bo[t] on þe erþ þen fell þei down and bett Apon þer bodes bare. þei rafe þer robes of rych renown, and als rude bestes oft þei rare. þei cast powder on þer crown, as foran folke febylly þei fare. And so þei satt in þat sessown, syghand sex days with sorow sare. Iob saw þat þei sayd noy?t, bot sat so lang alone with mornyng as he moght. to god he mad his mone. 1202 “Alas,” he sayd, “lord, with þi leue, why ledes þou me þus to be lorn? I haue not gone þe forto grefe, ne forfeytt so felly here be forne. why suld I suffer swylke myscheue of all men to haue scath and skorn? þi mercy, lord, vnto me þou meue, els may I ban þat I was born.

And whyls he wold with god dwell, he had welth of all werdly thyng; bot sythyn in fowle folys he fell, so dyd his pepyll, old and ?yng. he made þem calfys of gold and sayd þo my?t þem mend, bot sythyn þat bargan bold broy?t hym to haue yll end. 1271 Ieroboam wyll we leue at hame and neuyn an oþer nere þer by. Salmanaser was his name, and he was kyng of all assery. Als Ieroboam dyd, he vsed þe same, maynteinyng his men in mawmentry. þerfor gud folke he shent with schame, bot god saued his seruant Toby. Thys ylk kyng salmanaser, his foylies to fulfyll, wold wyt yf any were þat wold not werke his wyll. 1272 he commawnd all men lese and mare þat hym with sewt o[r] seruyce soght þat þei suld cum furth hym be fore and wrschep goddes þat he had wroght. Bot toby kyn wold not come þore, þerfor in bondag were þei broy?t. And he, all yf he ?ongest wore, euer wrschept god with wyll and toy?t. he fled fro his enmys to ierusalem in hye And made þerfor sacrafyce to god allmightye. 1273 þe kyng of wyll was so otrayge, all þo þat wold groch hym agayn, All wore yt man or woman or page, he commawnd þat þei suld be slayn. þen toby went with outyn wage, to bery þem he was full bayn, And all þat lyfes of his lynag forto dyffend was he full fayn. bot sone fro frendes he fled of ferre for dred of dede, And þore a wyf he wede comyn of his awn kynred. 1274 þat wyfe heyght Ana, as I herd say, þat euer in hyre trewth was trew, And vnto god so con þei pray. scho bayre a sun semly of hew. þe fader, þat lyfyd by moyses lay, wold make his sun aftur hym to sew And named hym Toby; þen ware þei two of an name, both old and new. þe fader with luf and aw lernd hym, whyls he was ?yng, To lyfe by moyses law and luf god ouer all thyng. 1275 Sythyn was þe kyng assent certayn, ry?t euyn als god wold þat yt were, þat Toby suld com home a gayn and haue his sted and all his store. Of þat fayre was his frendes full fayn, and toby ordand fast þerfore. So was he putt in power playn als mekyll os he euer was be fore. þe kyng commawnd to loke þat he had his all hale, And vnto hym he toke tresour with outyn tale. 1276 when Thoby þus had gettyn grace and gold was [g]yfyn hym grett plente, he went abowt fro place to place to cumforth folke of his cuntre. And no spense spared he in þat space to þo þat ware thrall to make þem free. þo folk ware fayn to folow his trace, for all þat sorow had socurd he. he beryd all þat ware ded whore he þem fand be fore; Into þe provynce of mede, and þus be fell yt þore. 1277 In [þe] rych Cyte of rages a frend of his be fore he fand þat lely lyfyd with outyn lese. þan had he lorn both lyth and land. Toby hym saw and my?t no[t] se[se], bot for his sake he was sorowand And bed his comforth to encrese at his power with hert and hand. Gabell hey?t þat gud man þat was so stratly sted. Tyll Thoby told he þan how his land was layd in wede. 1278 And he had noy?t þerfor to pay, whe[r]for he trowd yt forto tyne. þen to toby þus con he say, “ser, saue me and yt sall be þine.” þor toby toke to hym þat day ten talentes of gold fayr and fyne. VII C and XX libras weyd þei forto be wayred in wax and wyne. ffor ylke talent of þo, forto tell by trew payse, weyd XX libras and two; Catholicon yt so says. 1279 þis gud toke toby to gabell by sewrty mad be twyx þem two, And gabell sett þerto his seall by wyttenesyng of mony moo. Both in þer law þei ware full lele, as afturward was fundun so. þan wund Thoby with werdly wele and warescht all þat ware in wo. And so be tyd þat tyd, Als god ordand þerfore, kyng salmanaser dyed and past with payns sore. 1280 when salmanaser so was deyd and broy?t vnto his bereyng bowne, hys sun Senacheryb on hed resayued þe kyngdom and þe crowne. þo þat þe fader with wekyd red mad to be ponyschyd in presown, þe sun wold byd no bettur bede, bot bad þat men suld dyng þem down. So ware full mony slayn of Ebrews old and ?yng, And toby was full bayn at bere þem to bereyng. 1281 when þe kyng herd þat he dyd so, he had no daynteth of þat dede. he commawnd þat men suld hym slo and all þat ebrews lyf con lede. Bot toby was wernd of þat wo and conseld forto flee for dred. So was he fayn to flytt þem fro; his wyfe and his sun with hym ?ede. And all way was he bowne to helpe all þat had nede, And namly his nacion both forto cloght and fede. 1282 þe kyng persewyd with payns strang all ebrews kynd, wher he þem kend, þat to his fals goddes wold not gang to wrschep þem with hert and hend. þerfor god wold not suffer hym lang in wekyd lyf so forto lend. he mad hym with his warkes wrang at pase to wo with outyn end: with his suns was he slayn. þan be commun acorde was Thoby gettyn agayn and of hys guddes restored. 1283 þen was he sted with outyn stryf; full fayn were all his frendes fre with his ?yng sun and with his wyfe and oþer mo of his awn mene?e. he rewled þem by reson ryfe and gouernd þem in gud degre Aftur þe law to lede þer lyfe and to goddes bydyng bowsom to be. So fell on a dere day Thoby ordand to make A fest o[f] gud aray for his gud frendes sake. 1284 þei had daynthes of drynke and mette, he mad þem myrth with all his my?t. hym selfe wold ocupye no sett, bot to his sun þus sayd he ry?t, “gud sun, go loke yf þou may geyte any of our lyne to make vs ly?t, And bryng þem In with vs to ete.” þe chyld to werke his wyll was wy?t. he went and com agayn and sayd he fand ry?t none Bot on sodanly slayn and leuyd lygand alon. 1285 “And, ser,” he says, “I herd men tell þat he of myse no thyng had made, bot for he was of israel, with fals phylysteyns was he fade.” þen Thoby wold no langar dwell, he left gud men his geystes to glade. he and his sun, þem two o mell, toke þe body with outyn bade. In a howse þei yt hyde and mad þer geystes gud chere. At euyn dewly þei dyd to bery yt in best manere. 1286 All þof Thoby were well ocupyd, ?ett oþer wayte to werke hym wo, And all his counsell þei ascryd and in grett teyn þei told hym to, “þis ylk þat þou helpes to hyde, he had his ded for he dyd so; And þou was fayn be fore þis tyde þerfor to flee þi frendes fro. And ?ett þou dose þe same; and bot þou lefe yt soyne, þou sall beyr byttur blame for dedes þat þou has doyne.” 1287 Bot for oght þei cowth to hym say, to bery þis ded ay toy?t hym best. And so fell on a somers day, when he [of] swylke wer[k]e was werest, In his howse syd a lytter lay; þer on he reid hym forto rest. And þor hym fell a full grett affray: A bowue hym was a swolws nest. Als he lyft up his eye lyddes to loke agayns þe ly?t, hate fylth of swolows b[ry]des fell down and lost his sy?t. 1288 þis werke was wroy?t with outyn wene, for god wold so his pacience proue, wheder he wold turn for any teyne or to be lastand in hys loue. Sum of his frendes fast con hym meyne, and sum to malyce wold hym moue. þei sayd, “now is þi seruyce sene þat þou þe d[e]d so gladly groue And dyde grett almus dede tyll all folke þat wold frayn. lett se now in þi nede who gyfes þe oght ogayn!” 1289 þei say, “we hald þem wers þen wode— and so þi self sall say certayn— þat gyfes away his werldly gud and puttes hym self to pouert playn.” Bot Thoby euer full stably stud, of þer faygyng [he] was not fayn. þer malyce moued no thyng his mode; he loued ay god with all his mayn. he sayd, “?e do on myse In vayn your speche to spend. my lord þat sent me þis has my?t me forto mend. 1290 þis wo I wott I am worthy for weked werkes þat I haue wroy?t. I do me hale in his mercy þat mad me new when I was noght.” þei left hym þore and lett hym lye. he thanked god with wyll and toy?t. his wyfe and his sun were redy to mend his myrth all þat þei moght. þus when men haue dysesse, both kynred and counsayll þ[at] in welth wold þem plese wyll þ[en] full fayntly fayll. 1291 þus was Thoby in langor lent. he loued ay god both lowd and styll Of all þe saynd þat he to hym sentt, and groched neuer [i]n word ne wyll. þen on þat mone has he ment þat Gabell borowd of hym by byll. þerfor he wold þat sum man went to [f]eche yt and forward to fulfyll. he cald Thoby hym to, his sun, and sayd þus suyn, “I haue errandes to do qwylke I wold were wele doyne.” 1292 þe sun answerd full curtasly and sayd, “fader, I am all bown To werke your wyll, als is worthy, bothe nere and fere, in feld and towne.” þe fader was full fayn for þi and sayd, “sun, in my benesowne All myn entent tell þe sall I, take gud reward to my reson. Sun, Salmana?er þe kyng, or tyme þat þou was born, he ordand in all thyng to haue our lynge lorn. 1293 þore saw we mony sakles slayn, for of sere sydes þei ware out soght. To bery þem I was full bayn, bot to þ[e] lordes [þat] lyked noght. þen forto flee I was full fayn tyll all þat bale tyll end was broy?t. þen gatt I gud enoght agayn; euyn als god wold, so was yt wroy?t. ffull ?apely þen [I] ?ode a bowt to Cytes sere To helpe þem þat had nede and of our nacion nere. 1294 And sun aftur þi bryth yt be fell I fand on in [a] fare cuntre, born of our blod and heyght gabell. in preson herd haldyn was he. þore made we menyng vus o mell how my monay my?t make hym free. Ten talentes con I to hym tell to gyf agayn by gud sewrtye. he made a lettur lele of þat payment exprese, And selyd yt with his seall be for full gud wyttenese. 1295 þat same lettur with outyn lese haue I here forto send certayn. I wott full wele he wyll not sese þor with to make my payment playn. ffor I here tell of his encrese, how he hath gotyn his gud again. In a ryche Cyte, Rages, ys his wonnyng with outyn trayn. þidder wold I þat þou wende and þou couth ken þat place. þat monay now my?t mend to spend whyls we haue space.” 1296 The sun sayd, “ser, so god me sayue, I wold full gladly do þis dede. bot aftur þat cuntre forto craue I wott not whore my spech suld spede.” “gud sun,” he sayd, “go seke sum knaue þat wyll wend with þe for his mede, þat þou of hym may helpyng haue into þat land þe forto lede, And þat con vnderstand þe way tyll ?e come þore.” Thoby went furth and fand a fare chyld hym be fore. 1297 Iff he ware fare of flesch and fell, no ferly, for god had hym sent, his awn archangell, raphell, tyll ?ong toby [to] take entent, And mornyng þat was þem omell forto amend, so has he ment. he sayd, “I knaw full wele gabell, for to Rages oft haue I wentt.” ?ong toby was fayn þan, and to his fader he sayd, “ffader, I haue fun a man to gang all redy grayd. 1298 he says he knaws þat cuntre clere and þe gud man and þat same Cyte, And all þe way he wyll me lere.” toby sayd, “sun, god leyn so be! bot sen þou says he is so nere, pray hym come and speke with me, So þat I may þe sothe enquere of þis þat he hath told to þe.” ?ong Thoby [saw] [vn]soght [þe] Angell hym to byd, And so in he hym broy?t to his fader bed syd. 1299 So als þei stod þat bed be fore, the Angell þus vnto toby bade, “Be myrry, man, and mowrne no more, bot in þi god þou suld be glad. All yf þou sytt and sofer sore, sone may he seyse þi sorow sade And to þi state þe wele restore to haue more hele þan euer þou had.” when þe Angell þus had sayd, yf Thoby febyly ferd, In hert he was wele payd, bot all þus he answerd: 1300 “what myrth may vnto me avayle þat syttes in derknes euyn and morn? I byde here blynd as best in bale þat bettur ware haue bene vn born. All folke I fele now fayntly fayle þat ware my frendes full fast be forn. þo þat þen com me to consayle, now come þei more me forto scorn. þus am I sett certayn in dole both ny?t and day; þerfor I wold full fayn be fro þis werld away.” 1301 The Angell sayd, “thoby, take tent, swylk maters may non mend to moue. God hath þis seknes to þe sent þi pacience so forto proue. yf þou hym loue þat [it] has lent and be lele lastand in his loue, I hette þe þan in hast to hent full gud hele to þi sawle be houe.” Thoby sayd, “gray mercy! þis is full frendly red, bot grett hast now haue I of thyng I wold wore sped. 1302 my sun says þat þou wyll wend and teche hym to þe land of mede. þor dwels gabell, my faythfull frend, and vnto hym I wold ?e ?ede.” þe Angell þen with wordes hend sayd, “to þat land I sall hym lede. ffor in Rages þor can [I] lend, And to gabell þan toke I hede. I sall bryng þi sun ydder and sayue hym sownd in qwerte, To he com agayn hydder. þis hete I here with hert.” 1303 þan Thoby says, “ser, yf þou may bryng [me] my sun with outyn blame, I hete þe trewly forto pay þi hyre in hand when þou comys hame. And also, ser, I wold þe pray þat þou wold tell to me þi name, þat I may, whyls ?e dwell away, thynk on my sun and on þat same. And þi kyn more and lese wold I haue in my mynde. ffor wele I wott þou ys cumyn of full curtase kynd.” 1304 þe Angell sayd, “ser, for certayn, now thynke me selcowth of þi saw, And þi wordes thynke me wroy?t in vayn by sere resons to red by raw. I hette to bryng þi sun agayn werly and wele with outyn aw. þe nedes no ferther forto frayn my kynred, ne my name to knaw. bot neuer the lese ?ett, ser, to fulfyll þi fantasy, I reke not who yt wytt: my name is a?ary. 1305 my fader in his lyfe was leue to loue his lord both lowd and styll.” Toby says, “take yt to no greue, for sertes I asked yt for non yll.” he toke þe[m] a boyst with þat brefe þat þei suld beyre gabell vntyll, And sayd, “god sayue yow fro myschefe! wendes now furth when so ?e wyll.” ?ong Thoby þan kneled down; his fader and moyder he prays. To blese hym were þei bown, and so þei wend þer ways. 1306 A lytyll hund at hame þei had þat went Abowt not bun in band. what ?ong toby vnto hym bad he wold take hed vnto his hand; And to wend with [hym] was he glad by cause þat [he] hym frendly fand. In ylka a stede wher þei ware sted þe hound wold stably with hym stand. Now leue we Raphaell, þat ?ong Thoby furth lede, And of old Thoby tell, þat was full stratly sted. 1307 þe moyder drowped euer ylka day when scho wyst wele hyr sun was went; And to Thoby oft con scho say, “all our sele has þou fro vs sent, Our sun, þat suld vs wysch all way when we in any bales war bent. þou told þer was monay to pay, bot oþer maters has þou ment. yt was neuer for moynay þat þou so sone suld send hym þat our beld suld be and fro fawt vs defend. 1308 Alas, þat euer þou lerned þat lore at send our sun so to gabell! þat man may say, when he comys þore, he knaws of þi noyte neuer a dele.” Thoby sayd þen, “wyfe, mowrne no more, for sertanly all sall be wele. he sall fynd gud frendes hym be fore, so þat he sall no fawtes fele. I trow with outyn trayn þat goddes angell sall hym lede And bryng hym saue agayn full fayre als þei furth ?ode.” 1309 þus mekly mesyd he hyr mode and was full fayn hyr forto styll; And euer he thanked god of all gude and of all þe saynd he send hym tyll. þe wyf to wefyng craft scho ?ode and wroy?t þat werke with full gud wyll; And þor with fand scho þayr fode hyr husband and his folke to fyll. So in a tyme be tyde, for monay euyn to marke, hyr was gyfyn A ?ong kyd in reward for hyr werke. 1310 þat broy?t scho home vnto þer mette in hope to haue gud thanke for þi. Thoby lay blynd and herd yt blette, and in his hert had he grett ferly. “Bese ware,” he sayd, “both small and grett, of þat best how ?e com þer by. yt is not lefull vs to ete no thyng þat falys to felony. I warn yow yt is full wath with stolne fode forto dele.” þan was þe wyfe full wrath, and langer hyr lyst not hele. 1311 Bott out scho brast with byttur brayd and sone be gane barett to brew. with a sowre sembland scho sayd, “aftur þi dedes þi saws persew þat trowes þat we haue þe be trayd, whom þou has fun full trest and trew. And god ware of þi pennans payd, þou wold neuyn non swylke note of new. bot be þi sawys is seyn, aftur þis tale is tald, þat þou be fore has bene mystrowand ?ong and ald. 1312 þou releued all men lese and more, now hath þou mornyng to þi mede. ffor all folke þat þou fed be fore now fyndes þou few þe forto fede.” when Thoby þis herd, his hert was sore, bot softly spake he for his spede, “Sertes, woman, and þou wytty wore, þou wold not deme so of my dede. ffor yf I wroy?t goddes wyll, to welth he wyll me wys, And all þof I dyd yll, he may amend all myse. 1313 And, lord,” he sayd, “sen þou me wroy?t to wander in þis werld so wyde, Now in myn eld forsake me noy?t, bot take entent to me þis tyd. Sen sorows sere ar to me soy?t with sere assawtes o[n] euere syd, voch saue þat I my?t sone be broy?t out of þis bale þat I in byde. I wott I am worthy with more dole to dele, Bot, lord, in þi mercy ys all my hope of hele.” 1314 Now in the same tyme so be fell, als men may rede by resons ryfe: Sara, þe doyghtur of raguell, þat aftur was ?ong thoby wyfe, with hyre þan dwelled a damsell þat styrd hyr maystryse oft to stryfe by tenfull tayles þat scho wold tell of hyr þat lad euer honest lyfe. ffor VII husbandes all sere weded þat worthy wy?ght, And or þei neghed hyr nere, þei ware ded þe fyrst ny?t. 1315 And þis was [þe] encheson why þe fend of þem had swylke pauste: þei wede for lust of lechery, and [in] þat sted þ[em] strangeld he. hyr seruant was full fell for þi. “þou sall,” [s]he sayd, “no[t] f[a]re with me Als þou has done [VII husbandes dy], qwylk I wott wele were wed with þe.” And clarkes declarys yt þus: þat fend þat [foles] so fels ys named asmodyus. of swylke maters he mels. 1316 Bot sara was full sory þen þat hyre seruand so to hyr sayd. In to a preuay place scho wan. þer preuely to god scho prayd: “lord god, of whom all gud be gan, þou bryng me owt of þis vpbrayd, Als I neuer cofuett erthly man with me in lust forto be layd. haue mercy, lord, on me to sese my greuance grette.” þus dyd scho days thre with outyn drynke or mette. 1317 So when thre days tyll end war went, full sore wepand with outyn weyne To myghty god hyr mayne scho ment: “lord, sen þou has ay keped me clene, lett neuer my sawle to syn assent bot als þi seruand to be seyne And to þi laws trewly to tent, or to take me sone owt of þis teyne.” þus ware þei sore assayd, both Sara and trew thoby. þer for god has purvayd to mend þem with mercy. 1318 To þem he sent his archangell als A man semand to þer sy?t. bot in þer dole we lett þem dwell to aftur þat we rehers þem ry?t; And of ?ong Thoby wyll we tell, how he went with þe angell bry?t, And what ferlys to þem be fell, whore þei ware loged in þe fyrst ny?t. þei had harber full gud and beld, whyls þei wold abyd, Euyn fast be syd a flode þat heyght tygres þat tyde. 1319 þor went Thoby to wesch his fete; his felow folowd full fast in fere. A mekyll fysch þore gart hym grette, þat rose vp owt of þat ryuer. þat it wold lose þat chyld yt lette. he cald fast, “a?ari, com nere! bot yf þou helpe my bale to bette, þis fysch is lyke to lose me here.” þe Angell sayd, “be styll! wherfor is þou dredand? Take hym boldly by þe gyll and lay hym vp to þe land.” 1320 Als þe angell bad he dyd ylk dele; ane oþer craft þan he hym kend: “vnd[oo] his wome warly and wele and take hys hert owt in þi hend. his gall and his maw men may fele, for medsyns may þei mekyll amend. Salt þe fysche þan for þi ?ele furth in our fare forto be spend.” All þis was done in dede, and þore þei rest þat ny?t; And on þe morn þei ?ede þe way to Rages ry?t. 1321 And als þei cayred so in cuntre, Thoby sayd, “tell me, I þe pray, þe vertu of þer thynges III þou bad me ?eme ?isterday.” þe Angell says, “þi self sall see in what maner þ[e]i medcyn may Both to þi fader and to þe And to sara, als I sall say, And to hyr fader Raguell, þat wuns here fast be forn; ffor with hym wyll we dwell þis ny?t or els to morn. 1322 þor be we sted with outyn stryfe and ry?t welcom, I wot full wele. ffor he has rent and ryches ryfe and hape and hele fro hed to heyle. his doyghtur sall þou take to wyfe and be his heyre of ylka dele. And same sall ?e lede your lyfe with mekyll myrth at ylka mele. I vndertake to þe þis forward sall not fayle, And, ser, þan sall þou se qwat medsyns may a vayle.” 1323 Thoby þan hard and thynkes in hye þis bargan all tyll end is broy?t. he says, “my broþer a?ari, þis is nedlese, neuyn yt noyght. ffor of þat woman hard haue I what wo be hyr wedyng was wroy?t. I pray þe, gud felow, for þi: putt all swylk thyng out of þi toy?t. yt is not myn entent forto be weded so sone. Thynke þat we ware [for] sent, þat wold I fyrst ware done. 1324 This woman þat I here þe neuyn at fang to fere wold I be fayn. Bot scho was wed with husbandes VII, and sodanly all were þei slayn. And þou hath heyght with stabyll steuyn at bryng me to my fader agayn. Me thynke þou ordance all vn euyn þat wold I were put to slyke payn. I knaw not þat man þat hyr fader suld be.” þe Angell answerd þan and full sothly sayd he: 1325 “Thoby”, he sayd, “to me take hed: þi fader sall no fawtes fele, ffor safe agayn I sall þe lede and do his desyre ylka dele. My spekyng is all for þi spede and sal be for þ[i] soueran sele. ffor all þat weddes with luf and dred withoutyn fayle þei sall fare wele: with lufe both lowd and styll to lyf in goddes lay, And with dred to do yll both by ny?t and day. 1326 Of hyr VII husbandes wele wott I how þei were for done with a fende. And his ry?t name is Asmody; he has power swylke scherw[e]s to shende þat weddes for lust of lechery and takes [weddyng] vnto non oþer ende. ffor þat werke ware þei wele worthy furth with [þat] warlow forto wende. Of þos VII was none seyn in bed with hyr to be. So god has keped hyr cleyne to be weded with þe. 1327 þerfor take kepe to my counsayle, and styth þan sall þou gradly [go]. when þou is broy?t with in hyr bale and no[n] to geydder bot ?e two, To haue a fyre lok þou not fayle, and loke þat þou flytt not ferr þerfro. þor sall my medsyn mekyll a vayle, and þerfor take gud tent þerto. Take þe hert and þe maw, of aþer A remnand ry?t, And in þe fyre þem thraw when yt is byrnand bry?t. 1328 And þe vertu sall I þe tell, how yt sall be beld to yow bathe: þe smoke þer of and als þe smell with reke þat sall ryse vp full rath, May dryfe owt all þe dewls of hell, þat þei do noþer scorne ne scath. Dewle Asmody þen may not dwell; so sall ?e wun with outyn wath. And what ?e sall do more, now sall I tell þe tyll. And loke, when þou comys þore, þat ?e both yt fulfyll. 1329 when þis is done þus als I say, owt of all bale ?e both ere broy?t. þen sall ?e go your god to pray with hertly wyll and stabyll toy?t þat he ordand your werke all way aftur his wyll forto be wroy?t.

Then [Thoby] lykyd þor forto lend and lyf in prayers þo nyghtes three. he prayd his felow forto wende vnto Rages, þat ryche Cyte, And to gabell, þat he wele kend, to foche home his fader monye. þe lettur he toke hym tyll how all þer maters ment. þe Angell with gud wyll þat way full wyghtly went. 1345 To gabels howse full herd he hyde, and to hym sone he bed his boke. þen gabell wold no langer byde, bot ten talentes to hym he toke. þe Angell told to hym þat tyde how yong Thoby was wed þat woke. þen radly he rayd hym to ryde and sayd he suld onys on þem loke. And so ry?t furth he rode euyn with þe Angell ydder. ffull mekyll myrth þei made when þei were all to geydder. 1346 And Raguell [made] grett fest for þi with mette and drynke when þei ware mette, with all maner of mynstralsy and oþer game þat þei my?t gete. þen to þe Angell sayd Thoby, “sen we haue done dewly our dette, my fader wyll haue full grett ferly and we ouersytt þe tyme þat was sett.

Now is tyme to take þe fysch gall, þi fader of yt sall fauour fele. Enoynt his eyne wele þer with all, so by goddes saynd he sall se wele.” he was full fayn so suld be fall, and sayd yt suld be done ylk dele. his lytyll hund toke hede his herber was nere hand. be fore full fast he ?ede and wold no lenger stand. 1352 Old Thoby lay and lyked yll be cause þat tyme was so ouerpast. The wyf was wra[s]t outt of hyr wyll and sayd hyr welth a way was kast. ylk day sho went to a hegh hylle to loke als lang os scho moght last. þer come þe hund euyn hyr vntyll and fayned hyr with his tayle full fast. þen gradly sho aspyde and saw wele how þei come.

The sun his medsyn layd vnto his fader eyne in hy. þan had he sy?t and sayd, “I loue god allmighty, 1354 þat ay sall be and euer was, fulfylled of gudnese and of grace. I haue not lufed þi law, alas, ne trewly tent to take þi trace. And þou mekly for my trespase hath ponyscht me here in þis place, And now þus hendly heled me has forto loke in my lyfes space On my sun þat was sent, and here his course declared, And þe man þat with hym wentt forto be wele reward.” 1355 ffull mekyll myrth þei mad omell. þen the sun to his fader sayd Of all þer fare how yt be fell: fyrst with þe fysch how he was flayd; And sythyn of þe gud man gabell how he þer monay full prestly payd; þen how þei rested with Raguell and how þer wedyng was a rayd. “þus all þat my?t a vayle was done with outyn dystance By my felows consayle and his gud gouernance, 1356 wherfor he is wele worthy his wage.” þe fader sayd, “els god for bede!” Sone aftur þen come þer careayge with þe ?yng wyf worthy in wede, with charged mulys and mony a page þer catell forto fend and fede. þei ware mendyd by þis message in grett lykyng þer lyf to lede. So when þei neghed nere with all þis ryche[s] ry?t, þe fader and all in fere had ferly of þat sy?t. 1357 Bot sone als he couth sara see, he welcomd hyr and with hym lede. grett gladnes in his hert had hee þat his ?yng sun so wele had spede. Scho had seruandes in sere degre þat wund with hyr or sho was wede, And with hyr come to þat cuntre to beld hyr both at burd and bede. Old Thoby wyfe, Dame An, þat are lyfyd full heue lyf, with all comforth sho can welcomyd sho hyr sun wyfe. 1358 And derly dy?t sho þem to dyne, þer trauell toke sho tent vntyll. Sho broy?t þem furth both bred and wyne and oþer fode all folke to fyll. Old Thoby asked of his sun s[y]ne who aght þo guddes by ry?t and skyll. he sayd, “ser, þei ar goddes and myne and sall be yours euyn at your wyll.” þen on his knese he kneled and loued god of all thyng, þat so wold be his beld and owt of bale hym bryng. 1359 And for he wold Sara were seyne and knawn with all h[is] kynred clere, he gart make a fest fayr and cleyne and bad þerto his frendes in fere. þe Angell ordand all be dene, both mete and drynke with mere chere. þor wanted noy?t, wele may we weyne, qwer swylke stewer[d] was to stere. And when þis fest was done dewly in all degre, ylkon were ordand sone whore þem likyd best to be. 1360 þen sayd old Thoby, “my sun, take hede and tell me now be twyx vs two what we may gyf þis man to mede þat went with þe þus to and fro.” ?yng Thoby sayd, “for his gud dede he hath seruyd þer gudes and mo. Bot þe on halfe we wyll hym bede and vowche þem safe yf he wyll so, My wyfe and hyr mene?e to haue þe toþer half clere. þat is enogh for me to fynd þem fayre in fere.” 1361 þei cald þe angell preuely, and old Thoby þus to hym sayd, “we thanke þe hertly, A?ary, for all our hele has þou purvayd. we wott þat þou were worthy to haue all guddes þat here a[r] grayd, bot we pray þe, my sun and I, to take þe half and hald þe payd. And all þat fallys vs tyll of mobyls more and lese Sall euer be at þi wyll, als full wele worthy ese.” 1362 þe Angell þen with wordes playn sayd, “all þe soth I sall yow tell, Me lykes no langer forto layn: wytt ?e wele I am an Archangell. ffro god þus was I send certayn to mend all myschefes yow omell.

And for þou groched noy?t ny?t nor day when þou sych fell defautes fand, Now has he wast þi wo a way and sent þe welth to weld in land. Do os þou dyd be for[n]e: gyf almus with gud chere And þat yt be vp born with pennance and prayere. 1365 Also, ?yng Thoby, to me take tent, sen þou has wyf and welth at wyll. luf þou þi lord þat yt has lent, and loue his law both lowd and styll. And loke þat þou neuer to syn assent bot euer haue drede forto do yll, And kyndly [kepe] his commawndment, els may þou sped þi self to spyll.” þus lernd he als hym lyst how þei suld trewly trow, And þe[n] he was rauyschett a way, þei wyst not how. 1366 Thoby was se[v]ynty ?eres of eld when he be gan blynd to be. þat same defawt þen furth he felyd all fully fyfty ?ere and thre. þen was he broy?t to bettur beld in two and XL forto wele see. So in þis werld he my?t hym weld fyfe score and two [in] sere degre. þen saw he þat he suld dy and þe tyme to fulfyll. he cald his sun Thoby, and þus he told hym tyll. 1367 he sayd, “sun, I sall sone make end, to bere me loke þou not byd. þi moyder, sun, sall eftur wende, and bere hyr þen me fast be syde. pray þou þen god with hert and hend þat he fro harme þe hape and hyde; And kepe his law als I haue kend, þen sall no torfure þe be tyde. ffull grett defawttes sall fall to folke of Neneuye, And þerfor, sun, þou sall do als I consayle þe. 1368 þis Cyte sone sall synke certayn for syn bot þei þer myse amend. þerfor, when we ere past with payn, no lenger here loke þat þou lend, Bot wende vnto Raguell agayn with all þe gudes þat god has yow send.

Sho toy?t more þen scho sayd, bot mekyll myrth þei made. 1396 þe kyng come namly at þe noyne, and Aman, þat grett fauour feld. Sho welcomd þem, yf þei were sone, with all wrschep þat scho couth weld. And when þe dyner was all done, þe kyng vnto his qweyn be held And bad hyr boldly aske hyr boyne, for he was bowne [hyr] forto beld. Sho sayd þen to þe kyng, “my lord, be leue of þe, þis day I aske no thyng bot glad and blyth to be. 1397 And ferrer, lord, now wold I frayn, sen ?e to speke hath graunt me space, þat ?e to morn wold come a gayn to dyne with me in þis same place, And of Aman als I am fayn þat he playnly swylke power has.

And als þou hath assygned and sayd, þi self sall be his brydyll gang. And when þou has done so, to mete we sall go soyne.” þen was Aman full wo, bot wyghtly was yt done. 1405 Mardocheus had grett meruell þen what all þier maters my?t be meyne. bot wele he toy?t þe ground be gan of his cosyn, þe kynges qweyne. ffull sorely lett ser Aman be all þer dedes were doyne be deyne. Vnto his howse wyghtly he wan, and þor was sorowyng sadly seyne. Als þei so mornyng made, on come [hym] to rehete And sayd þe kyng abade to he come to his mete. 1406 þen went he furth [with] sygh[yng] sore, bot he behoued chaunge his sembland soyne. So when he come þe kyng be fore, he sayd his wyll was dewly doyne. þei went to mete with outyn more, and mery mad þe kyng þat noyne. The qweyn, for hyr frendes wepand wore, thynkes eftur mete to aske hyr boyne. Syr Aman thynkes hym shent, no mete my?t make hym glade, ffor he dowtes hym to hent more harme þen he ?ett hade. 1407 þe qweyne was fayn þem forto fyll with alkyn bestes and fowls fyne, with spycery to spare or spyll; and when þe kyng was glade with wyne, þe kyng sayd þen þe qweyn vntyll, “wyf, aske of me oght þat is myne; ffor half my kyngdom yf þou wyll, aske yt and yt sal be þine.” þen down to knese sho kneled sum dele with drery mode, And sayd, “lord, god yow ?eld! me nedes none erthly gude. 1408 Bot of þis boyn be seke I þe: his strengh to stroy and to gayn stand þat wyll confownd my kyn and me and stroy our lynag in þis land.” þe kyng askes, “what herlott is he þat swylke heghtnes dere take on hand?” Sho says, “lord, yf þi lykyng be, [ser] Aman has þis care cum[m]and.” when þe kyng herd þis word, [yt] merueld all his mode. he rayse vp fro þe burd and in to a garthyn he ?ode. 1409 þore went he hym forto a vyse what ware to carpe in slyke a kynd. þe qweyn seke on hyr bed sho lys, for scho was moued all out of mynd. ser Aman þen full spedely spyse how he my?t any fauour fynd. be fore þe qweyn he knelys and cryes to pray hyr þat he be not pynd. þe kyng com In with þat, for greued both gull and gr[en]e, And sees whor Aman satt at þe bed be syd þe qweyne. 1410 þat moued hym more to tene þat tyd, bot Aman with drew hym for drede. Vnto þe kyng an oþer cryde, “þis day is doyne a dolefull dede: Aman has sett his howse be syd A gebett, large of lengh and brede, Mardocheus þer with rewth to ryde. þus has he hey?t, who wyll take hede.” þe kyng asked oþer mo yf he swylk maystrys meyue. þei sayd all he dyd so mardocheus to myschefe. 1411 þe kyng þen cum[m]and his mene?e, “ser Aman tyte I byd yow take And hang hym self on þat same tre þat he mad for mardocheus sake.” þei were full blyth yt suld so be, and sone þat maystry con þei make. And jews þat soy?t [to] þat Cyte, þen mott þei wende to wynly wake. And qweyne was glad and blyth with merdocheus and mo. þei thanked god oft sythe þat þem had socurd soo. 1412 þus was his blyse all broy?t in bale þat to merdocheus mened full yll. his wyf and barnes, both grett and smale, were flemed ferre for þat same skyll. hys howse and all his howshald hale was gyfyn to þe qweyne to [w]eyld at wyll, And his tressour to tell be tale to jews þat were spoled forto spyll. þe wryttes þat were enseled at putt þe jews to payn, by wrytte þei were repelyd. þen were þo folke ful fayn. 1413 So was fals Aman hanged at hame, als he tyll oþer had yll ordand.

God graunt vs grace to end [in] luf and charite And all our myse to mend! Amen. so mott yt be! Iudyth 1414 Dame Iudyth was a gentyll jew and woman wyse whore sho suld wende. Now wyll we neuyn hyr story new, for to sum men yt my?t amend To see how sho in trewth was trew Als lang als sho in lyf con lend, And lufed þe law als lele ebrew þat moyses tyll hyr kynred kend. þat law forto mayntene sho ordand in all thyng, Als Insampyll was seyn and wyttenest in werkyng. 1415 Bot to mell [with] þis mater more þis lady now wyll we leue o[f] hand, And tell of fare þat fell be fore, als [our] faders be fore vs fand. A kyng, Nabogodhonosour, in Bablion he was dwelland. All oþer kynges and lordes wore full stably at his steuyn to stand. All þat lufed paynyms law and lyfed by mawmentry Aftur his dedes con draw and lowted hym fast for þi. 1416 he had þis werld sett at his wyll; hym toy?t no noye suld neght hym nere, ffor all his forwardes to fulfyll all hethyn folke were full fayn in fere. With ebrews oft hym angerd yll, for þem lyst not his lare to lere. Oft sythys he spyed [þem] to spyll with engynys and with sawtes sere. by sere cautels he kest how he my?t bryng þem down, Bot whyls þei lufed god best, to beld þem ay was he bown. 1417 þis kyng was strang in ylke stoure, and in all were he wan degre; And so he gat to grett honowre and conquered kynges in sere cuntre, wher for he fell in fowle errowre, als men may be exempyll see. he couth not knaw his creatore bot hoped þer was no god bot he. O[n] payn of lyf and lyme he warnd his men ylkon And bad þei suld hald hym þer god and oþer none. 1418 So in þis errour con he dwell als maystur most of more and lese, wherfore fowle vengance on hym fell to lyfe als best with grouand grese. bot here we haue no tym to tell þe poyntes þat proues all þe procese. ffurth with our maters wyll we mell how jewys ware doyne to grett dystrese. ffor þe[n] þe kyng ordand his ost with playn powere To dystroy ylka land þat his law wyll not lere. 1419 And to fulfyll all þis in dede to semble folke he wold not sese. he ordand on his ost to lede, A dughty duke hey?t Olyfernes, And bad all men to hym take hede and with hym wend in were and pese. þe fo[l]ke were fayn and with hym ?ede, and for þer cheftan þei hym chese. þe kyng bad þem not spare bot dyng down all be deyne þat wold noy?t luf þer lare, tyll all be conquered cleyne. 1420 þis dughty duke þat I of ment fro his werke wold no langer abyde. with full grett ost furth is he went with mynstralsy and mekyll pride. Cytes and burghes both þei brent, þe jewys to harme full fast þei hyed. Cornes and wynes shamly þei shent, þor was no trews to take þat tyde. þe jewys þat were dwelland In ierusalem Cyte Myght loke ouer all þat land and full grett soroyng see. 1421 when þei had so dystroyd and strayd and fuld þe folke be fyrth and fell, A sege to þat Cyte þei layd whore jews was [dy?t most] forto dwell. “we sall not sese, for soth,” þei sayd, “or all þe chylder of israel with all [þer] godes to ground be grayd. so sall þei neuer of maystry mell.” þei loged þem þore to lend and lyfyd at þer lykyng ffull fawrty days tyll end þat burgh in bale to bryng. 1422 Bot folke with in full wysly wake þer Cyte fast [for] to dyffend with allablasters and with bows of brake ay redy bown forto be bend. with gunys grett styfly þei strake, with in þer dynt durst no man lend. And euer to god þer mayn þei make þer mornyng with his my?t to mend. with In þat Cyte ere prestes to pray plente, And knyghtes full wyse of were to gouern þer degre. 1423 Bot þer degre was not to deme all yf þei were dughty of dede. þer enmyse were so bold and breme, to þem þei durst not batell bede. þer byschope hey?t elyachym, and vnto hym holy þei ?ede And prayd hym say how yt suld seme þem forto deme [in] swylka drede. he commawnd þen þat þei suld both with hert and hend Mekly vnto god pray þer myschefe to amend. 1424 “ffor so,” he says, “?e sall encrese and no thyng of ?our rebels reke.” he sett ensampyll [of moyses] and of þe grett abymalech: “he putt his pepyll fast in prese, to fell goddes folke þei were full freke. bot ay whyls moyses prayd for pese, god sett þer noys in þer enmys neke. yf we werke on swylke wyse and faynd our god to plese, þen sall non yll enmyse vnto vs do dysesse.” 1425 þei were full redy, os he [þem] red, forto aray aftur his resown. ffull bowsomly, os he þem bed, on þe bare erth þei sett þem down.
