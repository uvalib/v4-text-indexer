      <field name="fulltext">Females! the wily Harlot's Net beware, Pleasing's the Lure, but fatal is the Snare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A HARLOT's PROGRESS. In Six Cantos. Canto I. A Country Girl seduced by a Bawd. I find the Calling of a Bawd, to be a strange, A wise and subtile Calling; and for none But staid, discreet and understanding People. Valentinian. The various Scenes of vicious Loves I sing, Aid me, ye Gods, and imp my tender Wing, A Harlot's Progress briefly to relate, Her Birth, her Beauty, and her hapless Fate; How Youth and Age, by Turns, her Favours share, The Clown, the Cit, the Dull, the Debonaire; How Fops and Beaux her easy Dupes are made, With the sleek Cassock, and the smart Cockade; And how She show'rs her Gifts abundant down On the remotest Regions of the Town. And thou, O God of Verse, my Lays inspire, And warm my Breast with thy celestial Fire, This Female Proteus in all Shapes to trace, And paint the Wiles of that seducing Race. But first, her Birth and Parentage rehearse, Neither unworthy the sublimest Verse; No Titles did her Family adorn, Nor by her House, were Shields of Armour borne, No Coach, nor Gout, her Predecessors knew, Nor gap'd for Ribbons red, or Garters blue; They ne'er engag'd in Philosophic Doubts, Nor once concern'd themselves in Church Disputes; With them, all Monarchs equal Right maintain'd, And James and Nassau with like Justice reign'd. Scorning the Tinsel Glory of the Court, None of her Sisters e'er was Fortune's Sport; Nor lay a Sire of her's, nor Brother slain In Naseby's Field, or Blenheim's fatal Plain. The Clime which gave our noted Heroine Birth, Was Yorkshire; once renown'd throughout the Earth, For Horses and for Arms. A Cottage raw, With Walls of Mud, and thatch'd above with Straw, Had long the Seat of her Forefathers been, Who ne'er the Pomp of Palaces had seen, But liv'd at Ease, and no Vexations knew, Such as torment the less discerning few, Who daily at the Gates of Great Ones wait, And barter Happiness for empty State. Thus had they flourish'd in that lonely Place, From the Plantagenet's to Brunswick's Race, Unenvy'd, undisturb'd; no Pride arose, Nor ever dar'd to trouble their Repose. To his glad Sons each Sire convey'd his Trade, The Daughters all their Mother's Will obey'd; Happy they liv'd, as in Saturnian Times, When Peace and Plenty fill'd Hesperian Climes. But see the slip'ry State of human Things! What mighty Changes wild Ambition brings! One of the Daughters fam'd for Female Arts, Such as the Rural Neighbourhood imparts; Survey'd her Father's Cottage with Disdain, And view'd with scornful Eyes each am'rous Swain, No joyous Scenes her haughty Taste could please, Nor even the Squire nor Parson give her Ease. Strange Dreams of Grandeur fill'd her giddy Head, And now, all Hopes of Country Pleasures fled, She thus her Father greets—“Of Sires the best, “Grant (I beseech) your Daughter's last Request, “That I may hence, to London be convey'd, “Beneath our ample Waggon's Canvas Shade, “Or mounted on a Pack-Horse, to explore “For me, what Favours Fortune has in Store. She said. When strait her Sire indignant grown, View'd her with Rage, and curs'd the vicious Town; Warn'd her of Mischiefs, and each artful Snare Laid for the innocent, unguarded Fair. But all his Words were lost,—unmov'd She stood, And Her Request in stronger Terms renew'd. Her Father yields, at last, o'erwhelm'd with Fears, And her kind Mother sheds prophetic Tears; Her Brother too, and all her Sisters strove Such steady Resolutions to remove: But still in vain. Nor Pray'rs nor Tears prevail, Her Doom's decreed, and all Intreaties fail. The Waggon now, our Northern Nymph ascends, And takes a solemn Farewell of her Friends. But whate'er happen'd on the tedious Way, Aswhere they baited, where each Night they lay; With other Accidents, a Hundred more, Shall all be pass'd in deepest Silence o'er. One Thing howe'er I must not quite forget, A half-starv'd Curate on a scrovy Tit, Whose Knees were callous, and whose Bones were bare, With a long Course of Fasting, and of Pray'r, Close by the Waggon's Side jogg'd up to Town, Of his most Rev'rend Sire, to beg a Boon; But tho' true Pray'r and Fasting may engage Heav'n on thy Side, in this degenerate Age, Yet Church Preferments chiefly are bestow'd On the rich Drones, the lazy, and the proud. Then pray and fast, and wait your Patron's Will, Return you must, and act the Curate still. The Town, from Highgate, now our Heroine views, And her short Journey to the Bell pursues, Where, in the Yard, e'er she approach'd the Rooms, Up strait, a venerable Matron comes, Of Size unweildy, with a wadling Pace, Frosted her Locks, and patch'd, and prim'd her Face; Her Front deep furrow'd, and her Eyes on Flame, Like Cats by Night, and Bentley was her Name. This Load of Lust, this Lump of deadly Sin, First chucks the harmless Maid beneath her Chin, Then, like another Shipton, soon displays What shall befall her in the later Days. “Fret not, my Fair, said she, tho' now come forth “From the bleak Regions of the barren North: “Nor think that (Parents and Relations left) “You're here of Kindred, or of Friends bereft: “New Friends, new Kindred, you in us shall see, “And Knights and Lords shall your Relations be. “Of all your Goods we'll take a special Care, “Your Trunks, your Boxes, and your Country Ware; “Your loafing Cuzen shall her Goose receive, “And you, with us, in State and Splendor live: “That plain Straw-Hat, and Gown of homespun grey, “Shall soon be chang'd for Garments rich and gay; “On these fair Fingers, us'd the Threads to twine, “Rubies shall glow, and costly Briliants shine; “Yours shall be all, that Youth, or Beauty craves, “While Beaux by Thousands own themselves your Slaves. Thus spoke the Fiend Infernal, and betray'd, By her deluding Tongue, the harmless Maid; Who, ne'er suspecting Fraud, to Ruin run, Swallow'd the specious Bait, and was undone. Behind the Beldam's Back Colonel Charteris, with his trusty Man John Gourlay. Francisco ply'd, With his known Pander, and the Quarry ey'd; Monsters! who scarce, of Men, deserve the Name, Strangers alike to Honesty and Shame; A noted Pair, the Master, and the Man, Who use all Arts the Virtuous to trepan, This, a sly Satyr, swell'd with lawless Rage, And lewd in spite of Impotence and Age: And that, a servile Wretch, whose Study lies To spring the Game, and bear his Lord the Prize. But stay, my Muse; nor now the Theme prolong, The Sequel well deserves thy future Song. Canto II. The Insolence of Prostitutes in Keeping, Exceeds the haughtiest Sultan of the East. Now, was our Heroine from the Inn convey'd, A harmless, innocent, unthinking Maid, By that fly Pandress, to her known Abode, Of Lewdness, and of Lust, the beaten Road. Howe'er her Trade she still a Secret kept, Till the fair Prize had thrice securely slept Beneath her Roof; but when Aurora's Ray Shot forth, and shew'd the fourth enliv'ning Day, She thus her Guest bespoke, “Young Damsel, know, “That to your native Modesty I owe “My best Endeavours; Mine shall be the Care “For You a proper Station to prepare, “Freely to live in Pleasure, and at Ease, “Unshock'd by Hazards, in the Arms of Peace. “No more your Side, the Distaff shall disgrace, “Nor the swift Wheel resume its wonted Place: “No more these Hands their former Toils shall try; “Nor cumb'rous Burthens on your Shoulders lye; “Your Cares are past, your Slav'ry at an End, “Mark but my Dictates, and my Steps attend.” Then to Francisco's House she led the Way, Where the old Letcher close in Ambush lay Impatient, fix'd the trembling Fair to seize, Rank as a Goat, dissolv'd in Sloth and Ease; Whose boundless Flame, nor Youth nor Age escapes, Fam'd for gross Whoredoms, and renow'd for Rapes. With wanton Leer, he ey'd the harmless Maid, And to the Band, her stated Price convey'd; Who knew full well that an unbridled Lust, Like other lawless Games, admits no Trust. No longer now our batter'd Beldam stands, But leaves her Charge in Don Francisco's Hands, And hastes away, some future Prize to find, For Gold flow'd in, and she was always kind. Mean while the C?l call'd his Females round, And swore by Earth and Hell, whoe'er was found That durst the Stranger's least Command dispute, She dear should pay; his Will was absolute. All promis'd this, and no Concern was seen, For each She-Servant had a Sov'reign been, Sway'd in her Turn, and easily could portend, That e'er a Month was past, her Reign would end. Now did Francisco use his utmost Skill, To bend the stubborn Fair one to his Will, Fond Looks and Frowns alternately he try'd, And Protestations, Vows, and Oaths apply'd To gain his Ends, but she all Arts defy'd. Gold then he proffer'd, and with Gold prevail'd, For Gold has conquer'd, when a Godhead fail'd. The Fort thus won, she triumph'd for a while, And seem'd to sway her Sov'reign with a Smile, Pleas'd, in her Arms he spent each am'rous Night, Melted in Bliss, and revell'd in Delight; But ah! such luscious Scenes the Lover cloy, And slow Repentance follows short-liv'd Joy. Her kind Caresses now no more can charm, Nor all her Arts his Icy Bosom warm; Sated at length he flies her fond Embrace, With cold Indiff'rence views her beauteous Face; Strips her of all his former Bounty gave, And treats his late-lov'd Mistress as his Slave: Yet this was no way strange, for Hundreds more Had felt like Measure from his Hands before. What she should do in this disast'rous Place, She next resolves, and mourns her hapless Case, Raves, frets, and weeps, and tears her lovely Hair, And seems quite lost in Sorrow and Dispair. A thousand Thoughts torment her anxious Breast, Rack her poor Heart, and rob her of her Rest; This Way and that she roves from Room to Room, But finds no Refuge from impending Doom. Mean time to Court her base Seducer goes, And gives her some short Space for cool Repose; She then a Sister in Affliction calls, Who long had lain immur'd within these Walls: In whom she plac'd a Confidence sincere, “Betty, says she, since Fate has thrown us here, “Let's lay some artful Scheme ourselves to free “From this vile Sink of Lust and Infamy; “This C?l, Wretch, detested, vile, and lewd, “This matchless Monster of Ingratitude, “Has stript and plunder'd me,—for which I swear “Revenge e're long, or it shall cost me dear. Betty reply'd, “Let all your Sorrows cease, “Your Case and Mine's exactly of a Piece; “The Villain promis'd, canted, swore and ly'd, “And brib'd, and coax'd, and dress'd me like a Bride, “Was fond a while, but soon his Flame expir'd, “And now he loaths what he before admir'd: “I too was robb'd, forsaken, and undone, “And scarce durst call my very Soul my own; “But since you've vow'd Revenge, let you and I “Some strange, unprecedented Project try “To gain our Freedom, and this Tyrant leave, “(For Men are born to ruin and deceive.) “Then lend an Ear—You're not, I hope, so nice, “As tremble at the very Thoughts of Vice; “Nor wou'd stick out, so You your Ends attain, “To act the pleasing Transports o'er again. “Revenge, the Stranger cry'd, is now my Aim, “Which I'll attempt, tho' I pursue the Game “Thro' all Degrees, and Orders, and bow down “To e'ery Trade, and e'ry Sect in Town. “Bravely resolv'd, and like a Heroine spoke, “Says Betty, to cast off this galling Yoke, “A Thought has come this Minute in my Head, “A Jew I know, that gen'rous and well-bred; “Rich as a Lord, or Minister of State, “Who soon will snap at such a tempting Bait: “Your Shape, your Face, your Speech, your Air invite, “Thither forthwith, I'll wing my hasty Flight, “Tell him strange Stories of your Suff'ring past, “And how to London, you escap'd at last, “Dress'd like a Servant, from your Guardian's Care, “Who thought to match you to a booby Heir, “Tho' your Estate, in Yorkshire, might command “A Spouse, the best, and richest in the Land: “All this I'll swear, to perfect our Design, “Let us but both in the same Story join. Betty run on apace, her nimble Tongue, Like others of her Sex, was loosely hung; Till Miss, impatient, made this short Reply, “Prithee, make haste, be gone, hence, quickly fly; “I long to see this Jew, nay, never start, “Bring but good News, and I shall act my Part. Away she flew, as swift as Eastern Wind, This Son of Circumcision streight to find; Nor miss'd her Aim, for just from Change return'd, He with the Thoughts of a new Mistress burn'd, And scarce took Time to hear her moving Tale, (So much does artful Eloquence prevail) When, some preliminary Terms agreed, Back the Courier's dispatch'd, with utmost Speed; To fetch her Lady,—Betty run amain, And quickly reach'd Francisco's House again, With the glad Tidings did her Mistress greet, But urg'd a most precipitate Retreat, Before the Don's Return.—Howe'er, She Thought To rob the Robber, was no mighty Fault; Thus, both resolv'd, they rifle and remove With Bag and Baggage, to their new-found Love, Who met them at the Door, with Court-like Airs, And led his Nymph directly up the Stairs: Flatter'd her Vanity, and sooth'd her Pride, And us'd a thousand moving Arts beside To win her to his Will; but all in vain, A good round Sum must now the Favour gain, And as her Lover's rich, he well may spare, Or Gold, or Diamonds, to adorn the Fair. Now, Muse, the costly Furniture survey, Which grac'd his Chamber, modish, neat, and gay; Pourtray'd beneath a Gourd, here, Jonah sate, Expecting Nineveh's approaching Fate: King David, there, his antic Gambols play'd, When back the Ark from Ashdod was convey'd: Below, hung Woolston's Head, and Clark's above, Here stood a Table, there, the Field of Love, In beauteous Order every thing was seen, And now his Charmer treated like a Queen, A Month or two, in high Profuseness spent, But ah! such Happiness was only lent; She soon prov'd false, and, to her lasting Shame, Hir'd a base Wretch to quench her wanton Flame. Her Keeper, this, with Indignation see, And tax'd her close one Morning at her Tea; She scarce deny'd the Charge, but boldly swore, That John, and Harry, Tom, and fifty more Should share her Favours, and support her Pride, E're she would be to such a Coxcomb ty'd. Insulted thus, He hardly could contain,— When Madam snapt her Fingers in Disdain: With one sly Kick the Tea-Table o'erthrows, And the whole Floor with slaughter'd China strows, So much this Scene her black Attendant scar'd, That ev'n his woolly Locks with Horror star'd; But Betty and her Spark the Sequel knew, And wisely, with some Moveables withdrew; For well she guess'd, what Ills soe'er attend, A well-lin'd Purse is a substantial Friend. Enrag'd at last, the sprightly Levite rav'd, Her mean Gallant in roughest Terms beslav'd, Call'd her the vilest Jilt, the worst of Whores, Then, in a Moment, turn'd her out of Doors. Canto III. In Drury's Haunts our late elated Dame, Exposes both her Poverty, and Shame. Discarded thus, our Heroine chanc'd to meet Her gay Gallant, and Betty, in the Street, Whence hastning to a Tavern, they prepare New Stratagems, and form a future War. The Fair one vows Revenge against the Race, Both Jew and Gentile, for her late Disgrace, And swears that Peers, and Porters, high, and low, Shall own her Charms, and at her Altar bow. To compass this, like Cuma's frantick Maid, She summons all the Furies to her Aid, The Gods of Earth, and Hell, of Seas, and Skies, So high, at once, her restless Passions rise; And when, some Time, she'd saunter'd up and down, In a convenient Quarter of the Town, At length she fixes, and impatient grows, To fleece the Fops, and gull the brainless Beaux, To make her Name throughout the Place renown'd, And raise large Contributions all around. Then with choice Silks, and Mechlin Laces dress'd, Of Jew, and Christian Spoils at once possess'd, A while she flaunted, and each fleeting Day, In joyous Scenes, pass'd pleasantly away; Courtiers and Cits her easy Dupes were made, And Lords, and Lawyers, join'd to raise her Trade. The Church, the Ball, the Playhouse, and the Park, By Turns she view'd, where many an am'rous Spark Gaz'd on her Face, and sought the Prize to gain, And few who manag'd right, e'er sought in vain. But still her Substance to some Fav'rite went, For what she lightly earn'd, she loosely spent; E'en Dalton James Dalton, the Street-Robber, lately Executed., Wretch, of infamous Renown, Hugg'd her a while, and held her as his own, Told her of Honour's Ties, and Love sincere, Till Laws relentless robb'd her of her Dear; Whose Wig-Box still she keeps to look upon, In pious Mem'ry of the Man that's gone. Muse, cease a while thy Progress to persue, And deign her Chamber Furniture to view: But ah! her Fates are crost, the Times accurst, Her Second Lodgings are not like the First: A Bed there was indeed, but such a one, As she before had never lain upon, A broken Punch-Bowl on a Table stood, With sundry Implements of Tin and Wood, Pots, Pints, and Pipes, lay scatter'd round the Room, Some from the Ale-house, from the Gin-shop some, At her Bed's Head a matted Chair was plac'd, With a large Bason, and a Bottle grac'd; The first for Water us'd, for Light the last, For thro' its Neck, full many a Candle pass'd; Strange Signs of Poverty, but Sages say, That Wealth has Wings, and swiftly flies away. Her modish Hat aloft, and Cloak below, Hung on the Chair, no mighty Moral Show. That Birch was useful, ancient Fathers held, To lay the head-strong Member which rebell'd; But now for diff'rent Ends our Females praise it, And swear, sound Flogging is the Way to raise it. Two Heads beneath the shatter'd Windows hung, Sacheverel's, and Mackheath's, remain unsung, Both Doctors in their Way, both high renown'd, Their Merits like, and with like Honours crown'd; Vast Plund'rers both, and excellently pair'd, Who nor for Country, nor for Conscience car'd. This, a Lay-Brother, fam'd for Whores and Wine, And that, a Robber of the Race divine; This, for our Coin, set up a bold Pretence, That, for our Laws, and Liberties, and Sense. But, stay, my Muse, nor farther push the Joke, Lest you the Church's sacred Wrath provoke; The Sequel tell; for while fat Grace, and she, Were full engag'd one Morning at their Tea, Where their Tea-Table was a plain Joint-Stool, A Pat of Butter, and Half-Penny-Roll, Their humble Fair, the Butter thither sent On Title-Page from Past'ral Letter rent. As Madam, in her Dishabille survey'd A Watch, her mighty Industry had made; And squabby Grace, abridg'd of half her Nose, Slow, from her Seat, to fill the Tea-Pot rose Sir John Gonson., and all his Myrmidons appear'd, With Clubs, and Staves equipt, a num'rous Herd. The surly Knight, intrepid, led the Van, But stopping short, her curious Form to scan, The Beauties of her Air, her Face, and Shape, Did on his Zeal well nigh commit a Rape; Soften'd his Rage, and almost drew him in, To fall a Victim to the pleasing Sin; Till re-assembling all his scatter'd Powers, “Courage, my Boys! he cry'd, the Fort is ours, “Ne'er fear to make your regular Approach, “See here the Signs of Yester-night's Debauch. “And thou, vile Syren, these delusive Charms, “No more shall tempt fresh Lovers to thy Arms; “No more in Vice shalt thou triumphant reign, “Nor make the publick Loss thy private Gain; “The due Rewards of Wantonness receive, “And for thy former Follies, learn to grieve. This said, his stern Attendants seiz'd the Pair, Deaf to their Cries, relentless to their Pray'r, And speedily to Bridewell, both convey'd, To teach their tender Hands a rougher Trade. Canto IV. ? Unsanctify'd by Priests, Behold the Punishment of Lawless Love. Maria (for that Name the last she chose) Ere a base Crew disturb'd her calm repose, Who could but now, in peaceful Progress stray From Place to Place, and this, or that survey, Her Ease enjoy, and lye in Bed till Noon, And what she pleas'd to do, or leave undone, Doom'd to Confinement now, and Labour hard, From all the pleasing Sweets of Life debarr'd, In Bridewell, at the monstrous Hemp-block stands, And weilds a pond'rous Mallet in her Hands. The Keeper, Tyrant of tremendous Force, Stranger to Pity, and to soft Remorse, Still exercises his despotic Sway, On young and old, who tread that hapless Way. Thrice wretched Mortals, whom disastrous Fate, Has e'er inclos'd within that massy Gate. Stern are his Looks, and boundless is his Rage, And no Respect he bears to Sex nor Age, But all who loiter, certainly receive, The smartest Discipline his Lash can give Across their Shoulders. His ill-boding Eyes He throws around, and soon the Stranger spies, And thus accosts her. “These brocaded Cloaths, (“Sure Baits for empty Fops, and powder'd Beaus,) “Ill suit your State—Madam, don't think to waste “Your present Time, as you have done the past, “When you, in Lewdness took your first Career, “For Idleness finds no Indulgence here; “Exert your Strength, and all your Muscles strain, “Bridewell's a diff'rent Place from Drury-lane; “But if hard Work, and homely Fare, displease “One long inur'd to Luxury, and Ease, “View well this Weapon, its just Weight discern, “And soon from thence your future Conduct learn. “If Flogging fails, these awful Stocks survey “Behind your Back, and dare to disobey. “That lazy Rascal Mark, whose rebel Hands “Are there fast fix'd, and dread my just Commands. “Howe'er, if these should insufficient prove, “To warn or fright you from a Life you love, “The Whipping-Post's more prevalent than both, “To cure a Wretch of Indolence and Sloth. Canto V. No wicked Whores shall have good Luck, Who follow their own Wills; But purg'd shall be to Skin and Bone, With Mercury and Pills. Pope's Vers. of 1st Psalm. Say, pitying Muse, how direful are the Pains, Which vicious Pleasure in its Womb contains! On her short Joys what various Woes attend, What Mis'ries hasten young Maria's End! Grant me the Comforts which from Virtue spring; Pure are her Raptures, for they have no Sting: They glad the Mind, and (as the Morning Dew Cheers the green Herb) remain for ever new. Her Peace is lasting, and the Bliss sincere; Sweet in Reflection, and to Mem'ry dear: Not such the Scenes that follow boundless Lust, All are betray'd, who to its Flatt'ry trust. Deluding Sense! what do thy Vot'ries gain? A Moment's Pleasure, and an Age of Pain. Maria wept when in the dismal Jail, Nor wept in vain; e'en there her Tears prevail, And purchase her Release: But scarce was she From Bridewell's painful Drudgery set free, E'er strange Disorders her fair Frame invade; Her Charms decay, the boasted Roses fade On her pale Cheek, and now a lingring Fire, Not such as us'd to warm her loose Desire, Marrs her fair Form, and taints her beauteous Skin With many an Ulcer foul: Sharp Pains within Rack every Joynt, and torture ev'ry Bone, What Heart untouch'd, cou'd hear her piteous Moan. Sure, strictest Virtue might let fall a Tear, And wish the Pangs of Folly less severe. Each heavy Day was Witness to her Cries, Each Night redoubled her dire Agonies. “Ah! Grace, said she, wou'd I had never seen “This wicked Town, then happy had I been: “Wanton Ambition led my Thoughts away, “And made me, foolish, from my Parents stray. “Or had I been some honest poor Man's Bride, “I'ad liv'd in Comfort, and with Honour dy'd. “No Infamy had then disgrac'd my Name, “Nor vile Disease consum'd my tender Frame: “My Father's Counsel, and my Mother's Tears, “Are now remember'd, and increase my Fears. “With Patience, Grace reply'd, your Pains endure, “Nor doubt the Doctors can your Illness cure. “What if your Case should make you be laid down, “So have been half the Ladies of the Town. “I'll hire a Nurse experienc'd in the Art, “And ne'er myself from your dear Side depart. “But dang'rous is Delay: If you're agreed, “I'll fetch the Doctor here with utmost Speed. Maria yields, and soon the Quack is brought, With Countenance of Weight, and seeming Thought, He boasts what mighty Cures his Pills have done; What Myriads he has sav'd; ne'er dy'd but one, Of all the Thousands who implor'd his Aid; Nor had he perish'd, but he disobey'd His Salutary Rules. “Then banish Fear “A Month or two, says he, will make you clear “As is a new-born Babe: Again the Rose “Shall grace your Cheek, and captivate the Beaus. “A gentle Salivation will remove “Your racking Pains, and make you fit for Love.” Maria full of promis'd Health, prepares For all his Skill can do, or Ign'rance dares. And now, my Muse, survey th' afflicted Fair, In Flannel wrapt, and seated in her Chair: While Mercury exerts its conqu'ring Force, And to Salival Glands directs its Course. Noble Specifick! glorious is thy Use, 'Tis thou alone canst trace the pois'nous Juice: Thy Pow'rs the latent Ruin can expell, To its most hidden Source, and order'd well, Thy subtle Parts the inmost Frame pervade, And sinking Nature feels thy sov'raign Aid. By thee refin'd, the Blood revives again, And new-born Health flows fresh in ev'ry Vein. But other Scenes arise, when untaught Hands Profane thy Pow'rs, O ever murd'rous Bands! What wide Destruction your vile Trade does spread: What Numbers can suffice to count your dead. To Fame for ever be your Names unknown, Or with Contempt read in your Bills alone; Whose gilded Frauds the easy Croud elude, With promis'd Life and constant Health renew'd. The Wretched and the Weak the Bait receive, For Ignorance is aptest to believe. Officious Grace, thought all his Boasting true, Then fetch'd another of the butch'ring Crew. And now the Sun had led the sad tenth Day, Since first the Fair became their helpless Prey. When both the Sages in Maria's Room, Attend their Medicines, and her hapless Doom. Ill-boding Symptoms croud upon the Sight, A gastful Scene, and full of wild Affright. Grace scar'd, with Squalling rous'd the doughty Pair In Musings deep; when hasty from his Chair The meagre Dr. M?sa?n. Quack, whose Aid was last implor'd, Astonish'd rose, and 'gainst his Brother roar'd. Rising, his Foot Maria's Stool threw down, When the Scheme Practical, of cheap Renown, Her daily Study, fell upon the Ground, With shatter'd Cups, and Ink-Glasses around. Loud rag'd the Doctor's Ire; “'Tis done, he cry'd, “You've kill'd the Girl, if ever Woman dy'd; “You boast Arcanas that will still prevail, “E'en my Electuary I fear will fail: “To such Distress is she reduc'd alas! “Ye Gods, what Wretches for Physicians pass? The Don return'd, with grave contemptuous Leer, “You blame my Med'cines, sure you only jeer. “Tho' dire Convulsions ev'ry Nerve should strain, “This Phial holds what soon would ease her Pain, “What wondrous Cures can this my Nostrum do, “Such nor Hippocrates nor Galen knew. “Learning's all Cant, the College I despise, “This is my own; Disease before it, flies: “Vanquish'd in ev'ry Shape; by this my Name “Shall swell the Volume of Immortal Fame. “Your Fears the Danger make; but grant it were “As your own Ignorance great, I'd not despair, “With this one Vital-Draught to cure the Fair. Whilst thus in senseless Noise they spent their Breath, Maria sunk into the Arms of Death. How chang'd that beauteous Face, how swoln the Tongue, Whose Syren Musick caught the Gay and Young. Lost are the Charms which rais'd the World to Lust. What art Thou all, vile putrifying Dust, Shocking to Sight! Such ghastly Scenes attend On Vicious Ways, such is their wretched End. Amidst the Hurry and confus'd Alarm, Caus'd by her Death, while yet her Flesh was warm, The Drury Nurse her old Advantage makes; Rifles her Trunk, and thence her Treasure takes. Her Fan, her Mask, her Garments new and old, Whate'er her Hands can grasp, or Apron hold. While by the Fire Maria's harmless Boy, The lusty Product of her guilty Joy, Was plac'd, a Piece of Roasting Meat to turn, Lest its scorch'd Sides irregularly burn. One Hand the String, one did his Head engage, Mindless of Mamma's Fate, or Doctor's Rage. The Wooden Mantle-Piece above was grac'd, With Pots and Phials in due Order plac'd. High over Head were Shifts and Stockings strung, Here stood a Bed-Pan, there a Clyster hung. Never did Art a better Help produce, Of Application odd, but noblest Use. Canto VI. ? to the Coffin, from the Cradle, 'Tis all a Wish and all a Ladle. Prior. Still deign, my Muse, thy Progress to pursue, And the last Scene Maria's Fun'ral view. Ill-fated Nymph, by Vanity betray'd, And unto Vice an easy Victim made. Seducing Man, him free from Censure leave With Guile unpunish'd, others to deceive. Such was Maria's Fate! Such Cloe's too! Who leaning, stands to take a last sad View, Of her departed Friend; to whom she us'd To tell her Sorrows, when by Rakes abus'd. When aw'd by Bullies, or in Watch-house pent, For giving ill-form'd Words too free a Vent. With Hands up-lifted, O! what Change she Cries, Pale are those lovely Cheeks, and clos'd those Eyes. Whose pleasing Fires did ev'ry Youth enflame, Whose Lightning darken'd Love where'er it came. How marr'd that beauteous Skin, whose Lilly White, Fill'd ev'ry Eye with Wonder and Delight. Unhappy Nymph! Thee did I dearly love, Ne'er shall thy Image from my Heart remove. O cruel Death! couldst not thou find a Prey, Who sought thy Dart, and curs'd thy dull Delay. But thou must strike my Friend, in whom was seen Each tempting Grace, and fair as Beauty's Queen. By all the Brave was her lov'd Converse sought. To her the Rich and Great their Offerings brought. How sweet she sung; ne'er shall my Soul forget Her charming Voice and entertaining Wit, When last together we regale'd with Tea, How full of Mirth, how pleas'd, how brisk was she. Heart-breaking Thought! to be cut off so soon, In blooming Youth, 'ere Life had reach'd its Noon. Thus pensive Cloe mourns Maria's Fate, Nor thinks how shortly 'twill be her own State. Soon will that lovely Form, that charming Face, To wasting Illness yield each tempting Grace. Those beauteous Breasts white as the new fallen Snow, Whose Swelling Tides with Love's soft Ardor glow: By other Fires consum'd shall soon decay, And leave to Death an uncontested Prey. Six Sisters more, to Venus, Vot'ries all, Invited came, 'twas theirs to hold the Pall. With Phillis fam'd for Prettiness and Parts, For smart Intrigue, and all seducing Arts. There Mother Bentley, a noted Bawd. Bentley too was seen, with Forehead broke, Some ruin'd Fair gave the too gentle Stroke. Foulest Deformity, vile Sink of Sin, Who for th' unwary spreads her fatal Gin. Monster accurs'd, incarnate Fiend, whose Food Is slaughter'd Innocence, and Virgins Blood. She first the raw, unthinking, Nymph betray'd, Then triumph'd in the Conquest she had made. Now o'er her Corps the guileful Harpy cants, And wrings her Hands, but still remembers Nants. Which by her Side she e'er was wont to place, To ease her Sorrows, and her Griefs efface. The hateful Basilisk with hideous Squall, Does for her Polly, her lost Polly bawl. Together Martha and Eliza stood, In Converse deep, with each her Mourning Hood: And as they gaz'd upon the breathless Clay; Each strove a tributary Tear to pay. Ah! Martha cry'd, how oft we've spent the Nights, In joyous Scenes and amorous Delights. But Christ for Sinners dy'd; no doubt but she Will by his Merits live; or how shall we Expect to see the glorious Face of God, Who long the Paths of Wickedness have trod. 'Tis true, return'd Eliza, God is good, And Christ has bought us with his precious Blood, Or we had all been lost: Come let us drink, Nor on such melancholly Subjects think. Thus they by Education far misled, Nor own Heaven's Kindness, nor its Justice dread. Young Dorothy, a vain aspiring Lass, Had plac'd herself before th' instructing Glass; To fix each Patch in most becoming Place, And add to native Charms a killing Grace. Here mournful Isabella wipes her Eye, And o'er Maria cries, or seems to cry. To Sue the Biscake hands, and both prepare, With Soul-reviving Wine to heal their Care. A Blade who did the Funeral supply, Whose Friends oblige him, only when they die. As Sally's Gloves, his trembling Hands drew on, Gaz'd on her Charms till his fond Heart was gone. With Eyes up-lifted, in a loving Mood, Th' enamour'd Fool her graceful Features view'd. O Nature's Master-piece, he cry'd! O fair, O charming Creature, O beyond compare, Beauty's Perfection, I with Thee could live In all the Joys that Love and Life can give. But soon will he repent each am'rous Leer, And load with Curses his bewitching Dear. Sally, who ne'er forgot to play her Part, Regarded more his Pocket than his Heart. From thence his Handkerchief she slily took, While with an artful and ensnaring Look, She him amus'd with Talk about her Glove, Or smart Reproaches for his ill-tim'd Love. Maria's Offspring on a Stool was plac'd, With all the Pageantry of Sorrow grac'd: No Grief his thoughtless Innocence annoy'd, A Castle-Top his buisy Hands employ'd. To Phillis next turn thy all watchful Eye, Observing Muse, and a new Scene descry: A Son of Levi, destitute of Grace, Touch'd with her Air, and gazing on her Face, For am'rous Reasons to himself best known, Had plac'd her on a Chair next to his own: Nor weeping Sisters round, nor Corps before, Could cool his Fire, or damp his new Amour. Strange Scene in modern Times! In former Days When holy Ignorance held Reason's Place, Priests might uncensur'd quench their wanton Flame, And no dull Layman dare his Lord to blame. To such a Height was ghastly Bondage brought, By Jesuit Arts they govern'd ev'ry Thought: By Fears of That to come, this World they gain'd, And o'er the servile Mind despotic reign'd. Their baleful Tyranny all Limits broke, Or still the Hood-wink'd World had felt their Yoak. Still did their Empire hold, and they were thought Heaven's high Ambassadors, till better taught By their low earthly Views, th' astonish'd Croud Found 'twas to Idols, like themselves, they bow'd. Thence first Discernment rose, thence Men began To lay the Priest aside and view the Man. Sweet Source of Liberty! blest Dawn of Light, That freed the Mind from Bigotry's black Night. Garbs change not Men, and maugre Cleric Wrath, Or bold Pretence of Dignity of Cloth, Devis'd to awe the superstitious Throng, To Goodness only Reverence does belong. But cease, my Muse, thy Wand'rings to pursue And of our Levite take a stricter View, Who close by Phillis sat. One Hand did hold The trembling Glass; but never be it told Where t'other was engag'd. His Eyes grew dim, Nor saw the Wine o'er-flow the Christal Brim. Sly Grace, who serv'd the sprightly Nectar round, Guess'd where his Hand might be, and grimly frown'd. At other Times 'twould not have rais'd her Ire; But Decency, she thought, did here require, A Conduct less impure: And in a Priest, 'Twas bad as Fornication at the least. Regardless, he, of Grace's Frowns, or aught That might induce the Mind to serious Though, Commences Lover, and to Phillis sues As ardently as for Parochial Dues: Praises her Face, her Shape, her comely Mein, Protests his Love, and hints at Charms unseen. Arch Phillis smil'd, Fie Sir, you spill the Wine, Is this Employment worthy a Divine? Cease your lascivious Airs; your Cloth shou'd be Examples to such ignorant Things as we. Strait from your Head these foolish Freaks remove, Is this a Time, at Fun'rals, to make Love? My Dear, he cry'd, Thou fairest of the Fair, Love will attone for all; your Censures spare, Such Charms as yours bid ev'ry Doubt depart; Despise Confinement, and engross the Heart. The Rev'rence due to our black Cloth I know, And what t'our sacred Character I owe. But still be Witness ev'ry Day and Hour, We too are Nature's Sons, and feel her Pow'r. I find it, Phillis, with a Sneer reply'd, I thought your sacred Vestments did but hide The nat'ral Man: And when you'd seem a Saint, It ever brought to Mind a Fable quaint, Which Æsop of a dronish Creature tells, And in his Stories sage Instructions dwells. This Creature fill'd with Pride, long study'd, how To make his Brethren to his Honour Bow. Mean in himself, incapable of aught That could create the least admiring Thought. At length by Chance a Lyon's Skin he found, And joyous wrapt the noble Booty round. His homely Body then with Lordly Mein, He strutted forth, but ah! his Ears were seen. Your Pardon, Sir, I would not think all such Who wear the sacred Cloth, nor blame too much; To some is due a venerable Name, Whose hallow'd Breasts burn with a purer Flame. Thus wanton Phillis lash'd the Levite's Lust With bitter Sarcasms, and Reproaches just. A while he shew'd Resentment, and complain'd Of mean Reflections, and his Order stain'd With Scandal false! then cry'd he'd her confute, In proper Place, and end the long Dispute. Phillis agreed; and what they after did, Or where they met, is from my Knowledge hid. Maria's Fun'ral now requir'd his Care; But cease, my Muse aught further to declare: As, o'er what Grave now hovers her pale Shade, Or who her low emblazon'd 'Scutcheon made. Three Spigots, in three Fossets plac'd, rehearse; Arms worthy Harlots, but too mean for Verse. FINIS.</field>
