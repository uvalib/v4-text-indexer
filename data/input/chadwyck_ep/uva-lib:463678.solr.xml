      <field name="fulltext">Here beginneth a song of the Lordes Supper [[The first part.]] O God who is worthy thy great loue to expresse Which y? on vs hast showid or w? word it inlarg For wh? Sath?, w? sin was like vs to oppresse Thou s?dyst thinown begott? son vs to discarg Through his godli life &amp; or the end of his viage He ordeyned a sygne, for oure weke soules moost holsom Wherby we shulde thynk on the loue of his personage And remember his deathe, vntyll the tyme he comme. Gyue attentyue eares, I hartely you desyre To heare thinges profytable, leest profyt scape by Therfore diligently to harken I you requyre Ye wyll call it profyt, I dare well veryfy To be inflamed with Christes loue, as with fyer heuenlye For with goddes grace, I wyll tell you the hole som Of Christes supper, assigned very necessary For vs to remember the Lordes death tyll he com. Dyuers vertuous namynges, hath this holy signe Callyd the Lordes supper, in the pistle of saynt Paule Agayn a Communion, Christes churche to conioyne In charytie by a supper vniuersall And thankes geuyng to God, for his benefyttes all And a wyll of synnes forgyuenes, to deaf and dom And by this text, do thus me to your mynde to call A remembraunce of the Lordes death, vntyll he com. The Lordes supper, is Christes institution pure In the which, breade and wyne geuen &amp; his worde adioyned Was geuen his body and blood, which dyd oure soules cure Set furth now, that all they which haue a faythfull mynde In these wordes, broke and shed for you, with a lowe kinde Shall haue remission of there synnes most noysom And great quyetnes of conscience they shall fynde In remembryng the Lordes death, vntyll he com. The occasion whi Christ this supper dyd begyn Where: the time of his deathe was com oure soules to saue An other, he knewe, we were forgetfull by syn And that of his memory som wolde vs depraue Therfore effectually his corps to vs he gaue In a supper for our soules a meat most houlsom And this is the very finall cause which he then draue That we shold remember his great loue tyl he com. The order of this supper who soeuer do breake Alter, peruert or, torne, otherwyse then Chryst made He is a sismatike and doth the churche greate wreake And blindeth mens consciens and makyth faythe to fade In cawlinge Christes body that very popishe trade Making vs knele thereto lyke blind Ipocryts dom Thus with a false sauior they do our myndes perswade Causinge vs to forget Christes deth vntyl he com. It sholde be orderyd as the apostels vse the same Teaching before, a worthye preparacion. That al such maye suppe, which to heare of synnes do shame Repenting and sekinge their soules consolacion Beleuinge to haue of al theyr synnes remyssion. And to confyrme theyr fayth receauinge this sygne holsome Euen as a wytnes, of goddes benediction. In Chryst: rememberynge his deathe vntyll he do come. The partakers of the supper, shold be put in mynde To take a suere holde, of there promyse of baptysme And to forsake the deuell, with al his workes blinde with euerye false Antechryst, euen the dyuelles lymme As the Pope: which with foule Idolles the church doth trim Therby to make them in gods knowlege deffe and dome And al to maintayn the tradicions of hym Utterly to forget the Lordes death, tyl he come. Then the minister must purge the congregacion For euery one, whiche lyueth in great fautes manyfest Shold be put from the borde, by exc?munication Al such as gods word slander, yrke, slake, or detest Al wylful weake, which in blind cerymonies wyl rest Ar to be refused tyl they wyshe for gods kingdome And when they mend, to be taken in amonge the rest For to remember the lordes death tyll he come The receyuers also, must themselues suerly proue Whether they may worthely eate &amp; drynke of y? lordes cuppe That is, yf with his brethren he be in pure loue. Or yf he canne for gods glory, a bytter death suppe Or y? he do not by muche eatinge, in slothfulnes drope Or else by great fasting, for his owne supper lost and glome In suche case from the flocke, ye were best to ryse vp Least he be gyltye of the lordes deth, tyl he come. When al myndes be cleane, y? seruer must come to y? borde And be plaest in the mydest, most lyke Chrystes example To showe them of the pascal lambe, in a short worde And what it signyfyed, in playnnes he most tell That Chryste sholde saue vs from deuil/death/sinne &amp; hell For y? which, he made sacrifyce sweter then gomme And wyllyth by his ordinance, vs in loue to dwel Breking breade, to remember his death tyl he com. Then must he sytte downe lyfting vp his eyis to heuen Thankinge god the father for his benefyttes all That to vs pore sinners hath his only sonne geuyn Which vnto his fathers mercy dyd vs agayn call And by his death, is become meat vnyuersal To al soules, which therby beleue synnes remyssion Therfore the misticall body of Christ receyue ye shall That ye may remember the Lordes deathe, tyll he com. Th? must he take bread &amp; break it showyng Christes act Sayeng our Lord Iesu Christe the nyghte he was betrayed Toke a loef of breade &amp; when he had geuyn thankes brake it All the twelue Apostels present, to whome he sayd Take it, and eate, these his wordes ought to be wayed This is my body which shall suffer passyon For you do thus that on me your mynde may be layd To remember my great loue and death tyll I com. Here Christes wordes he shold expo?d y? none vnderst?d Falsely, as som do, that Christ made his body of breade Rather then shold with all diligence Christes wordes stande And they shall fynde, he gaue vs that body in dede Whose woundes after he sufferyd on the Crosse to bleade That is, the merites of his body he gaue in som At that one tyme, for all them that of his death shold nede And the signe caulyd his body tyll agayn he shall come. His mystycall body in this wyse they do eate When that soules are satisfyed or fylled by fayth sure That his body redemed vs, and is our soules meate Wherby our soules please God and liueth as saith scripture For were not his body ours, we could not endeuour But God hath gyuen hym vs, with his workes and wisdom And hymself gaue vs his body, our soules to cure Yf that we do remember his death, tyll he com. The aduersarye wyll resist and with wordes saye How can he gyue his body? from which he can not part Agaynst such an enemy, lo thus I wyll inuay Euen as a frend, which wold me good with all his hart Geueth me his body, to helpe me by all his art Where euer he be, my profyt he wyll se don I may call his body myne, which kepes me from smart? So shal the Lordes body be ours, when he doth com. Then must he delyuer to them the broken breade Byddyng them thinke how Chryst gaue his body for ours The Iust, for the vniust as. S. Paule sayeth in dede To couer our fautes and kepe vs from al sharp shoures And therfore c?maundeth th?, to pray with al there powers Worthely to eate his body, there fautes to confirme And to him, as to god, gaue prayse and honours Leuing a remembrance of his death, tyll he come. Then must he retorne againe, to Chrystes wordes or text Shewing that Christ after supper wh? thankes was geuin Wrought as he dyd with the breade and toke the cuppe nexte Sayinge drinke al here of, with equal mynde and euen This is my blode, in the newe Testament dyscryuen Which for you and many shal be shed for synners pardon Whose frute I wyl no more drynke, tyl w? you newe in heau? As oft as ye drynke thus, remember my death, tyl I com. Here is to be wayd the text of Paul, with Chrystes vowe Wher Chryst sayeth this is my blod of the newe Testament Paule semeth playne, y? Chryst doth it in this wyse alowe This same cuppe is of my blod the newe Testament Chryst shewyd that his blod, which afterwarde he spent Paul causeth the takyng of the lordes supper in some The newe Testament of his blod verament That is, his wyll to thynke on his blod, tyll he come. The blod of his Testament, is this moch to saye His owne blod, that partayneth to his last wyl Namly the blode, which he wolde to geue awaye To saue those, which by trew fayth wolde come hym tyll The Testament in his blode, is and other skyll Euen a wylle to remember his blod and kingdome Whiche doutles, they shal haue in Ioye euer more styll Yf they drynke this cuppe, to mynd his death, tyl he come. Then he must make them al drinke with repentant mind Sshowing that christes blod, is for our soules the offring To cleanse y? thoughtes of our hartes from yngnor?ce blind Euen that wyth hym in heauen, we myght be euer lyuinge As the .xvii. of Leuyticus is afore showing Where god sayeth/the fleshe is to porge the lyffe noysom And the blode/is for the soules offence a clensynge Wherfore remember ye/the lordes death tyl he come. Then, must they al prayse the father most reuerently Wyth the sonne and the holy gost, for this there gyfte And ordynance/to confyrme our fayth faruently Wherby from our trust in hym we can not be lyft Through Sathans wyldes dryue he neuer so great a dryfte And thus we praye now, that the lordes supper is done That at our next metyng, from synne we maye be ryft Firmly to remember the lordes death tyl he come. Here haue you the fyrst parte of this notable songe Whiche I wolde desyer you marke/or I furder wente A thing is harde to be remembred, that is longe Therfore thinke on yt, I desier you with pure intente And by that tyme you haue this in to your mynde sent I wyl shewe you the seconde parte, in a shorte some Wherby, you maye knowe more stedfastly verament Howe/you shall remember the lordes death tyl he come The ende of the fyrst parte By. E. T. The begynninge of the seconde parte of the diuision and particion with contraryes of the Lordes supper. Som there be whiche despise the popysshe sacramente (As worthye it is for it doeth god dysshonor) But to seke for the trueth, was neuer theyr entent And som agayne/do the abuse so moche abhor That by the most ryght vse, they set at al no store Wherefore, the minister to teache sholde not be dome That the text sayethe, do thus alwaye and euer more That ye maye styll remember my death/til I come Somwhat of the circumstances here showed shold be As, why it is called a supper and no dinner Bycause/after supper most comenly we see How men from there greate labor vse, to rest euer The syttinge, the same sygnifies/and to perseuer In rest of conscience, through Christes death most holsom And when to Iudgement, he shal him selfe endeuer To haue an heuenly rest, after that he is come. To constrayne, vnder payne, to knele stand or sytte Is not mete nor yet fit, though sitting be most sure For the strayght and strong wayght, consystith not in it For standing, partaking, one may be good and pure Be wyttinge that sytting is nerer the scrypture To auoyd knelinge lewed of thancient costome To a thing, yl seminge, in blindnes to endure A false god, and forbod, in mynding Christ to come. Here the minister may make a ronning out Into the causes, partes effectes and contraries Bycause, he wolde bring the hearers from euery dought And that nothing may be left hyd, vnto there eyes Saing Christ is the causer as the act it tries Breade wine and the worde, be the hole matter in som The formes he feding, which causeth our fayth to ryse We are the end, to remember the lordes death, tyl he com Chrystes last supper is not deuided into partes But the matter thereof in partes we may deuyde Namely bred which mistically to vs aduertes His owne body wich was persed on the right syde And the wyne his blode/which r?ne out of that wonde wyde The ioyninge of these partes this error haue begon That from the lay men Christes misticall blod is hid And should be except god mend it vntill Christ com. The formall cause also may be parted in twayne Euen into a spirituall eatyng and corporall The corporall makes vs vse Christes supper in vaine That is to eate without christen memoriall And he y? so vnworthly eateth or drincketh sayth Poule He surely eateth and drynketh his damnacyon Bycause he perceyues not the Lordes body at all Nor therby remembreth the Lordes deth tyll he come. Let not him that so eateth thynk that his partaking Of Christes supper clensyth or taketh away his synne Nay suerly it must be fayth that must do that thyng The which fayth to confirme, Christe this signe dyd begyn Euen as the signe wher Steuin sawe Christ y? cloudes w?in Not saued hym but strength his fayth toward gods kingd? So the vse of this signe, to strength our faith doth not blind Fyrmely to remembre the Lordes death, tyll he come. Som perchaunce against this wyll make an argument No outward thyng confyrmed fayth, but the holy goost The vse herof/is an outward experyment Therfore, it confyrmes no faytth, nother lest nor most The mater is trewe, of it/I dare bouldly bost Yet as w? instrum?tes/by signes/he moues out spretes dom Being to the weake a felt worde/lest fayth shulde be lost To make them remember the Lordes death, tyll he com. The spiritual eatyng is done by fayth chefly After with, a goostly refection doth flowe That is, he conceuyth in hym the profyt heuenly And by worthy examinacyon, does know The differens of this supper, from his owne, I trow That it is not a fleshly supper, of crust or crom But suche a supper, as shall hym the ryght way showe How he shall remember the Lordes death, tyll he com. Oftentymes christen persons, with outwarde signe Use dayly, the spiritual etyng of Chrystes body When spiritually as true gyftes in Christ they inclyne To abide in Christ, and in them Christ most holy Of this etyng Iohn the sixt hath a puer story Wher Christ, long before his last supper tought in some Whoche of his membres shuld haue in memory That al his benyfittes be owers, vntyl he come. Notwithstanding, both of eting must be kept Namely with the mouthe, but with faythe in specyal None of bothe, amonge Christes flocke may be oure sheperd For of these bothe, the lordes supper is made formal And by the sensyble tast of thinges corporall Wecklinges shal fele the profit of Christes body in som Howe he came to fyde and fyl our hongry soules al Remembering the ioye we shal haue when he doth come The effectes of the sygnes of the new testament Be remission of synnes and her ryghtuosnes And in this, euerlasting life and permanent And that god is plesyd with vs, to be wytnes And that he with Chryst, dwellyth with vs, of his goodnes To styre fayth and make charyte worke thinges holsome And there in to bringe Ioy of consciens w? gladnes And to make vs, not departe from Christ tyl he come. Of Chrystes supper here was the diffinicion The causes partes and the effectes be now here declaryd Of the most true sowen a true descripcion Nowe restyth by hym to be showed and not be sparde Errous or contraries, so thys sygne of safgard Before that the ende of this songe we do come That we maye lerne to auoyd such perylles ieberd In remembring the lordes death vntyl he come. Of this voyce/hot, very many haue desputyd Some, it atributinge to his body onely And some to the blood onely/it attributyd The fyrst/concludes Chrst lest no sygne of memorie The seconde sayth, Chryst made him selfe a new body But I attrybutyd to nother, onely in some But gether to the hole acte don openly And to his congregat members, tyl he doth come. Also/some tyme Paul callyd it the body and blood And sometyme agayne, he calleth it but bread and wyne This textes of many haue ben falsly vnderstode Thorowe ygnorans of fygurs in scrypture dyuyne The fyrst is netho nemya/where as the sygne Hath the name of the thing sygnifyed in my dome By reason wherof, I may it this waye inclyne This is my body, or sygne therof tyl I come. These .ii. is senechdoche some part wher in Is tak? for the hole, as here for Chrystes supper brede Or els where so euer any tyme, breade hath bin There hath ben chrystes supper, whiche is not trew in dede And yf it were the very body, which dyd blede To be called breade it wer but an yll costome And a doutful fayth, at lenght in vs it wyll brede And cause vs, take an Idol for Chryst tyll he come. Errors agaynst the supper, there be full many As to saye, the popysshe masse is ther which equall Callyng it the lordes supper which is a greate lye For in no porcion trulye they great al But in comparyson hereof, is beastiall Both of quicke and deade for the faultes that they haue don And oblacion or sacrifice, they it calle Forgettynge Chryst, offring ons for al, tyll he come. Contrary to the supper it is to deny That vnder breade and wyne to vs is mynistred The pure body and blode, of Iesu which dyd dye That our soules, by his body and blod myght be fed For in this his supper, he gaue to vs in dede His selfe same bodye that he ment syn to consume The sure trust whereof truly is our soules brede Wherefore, we ought to giue thankes to him tyl he come. Here is to be marked that geuen vnder breade and wyne Is not as muche to saye, as breade is Chrystes body Or wyne chrystes blod, nay we do it not so defyne But geuen vnder, is as muche to saye verely As when so euer you do thus which belefe truely You fele in your conscience, chrystes promyssion That as wel for you, as for them that were him by He gaue him selfe to be remembryd tyl he come. That breade is the body, or the body is in breade Shal men haue resoned, with wordes supersticius Of the presence of chrystes body and bloud so redde And of what facion, or howe bigge to dyscus They haue, not bin a shamed lyke foles pernicius To the fayth of christ for vs a stay most holsome Forgettinge christes ascenssion, so maruelos Into the ryght hande of the father/tyl he com. For suche cause, the Cataphrigians dyd wring out Childrens blod of a yere ol, through many smale pricke Which they dyd mix w? flower to bringe there mynde about Trustynge that in that breade, there was a bodye quicke Thus they made the lordes supper with theyr folyshe tricke And they did set vp a false body, in Christes tome Wast any meruel then though in soule they were sycke Whyche vtterly forget chrystes death before he come Theyr acte, is lyke the wychecraft of one Pope Gregory Which bounde the fynde in the host lyke a man to pere Al to illude the good Emperour the .iiii. Henry But when of his pupose, he was neuer the nere He began to vex and chafe, fret, stompe, stare, and swere And axed the fynd, whi? to hym he was not buxum To whome he sayd, where fayth is: I cannot be there Happy be the myndful of Chrystes death tyl he com. To put or take from the lordes supper is errore To approche to the supper, with out al reuerence (By outwarde preparacions, god settes no store) To deny that suche as lyue in incontinence Are to be put from the Lorde, and banishid from thence To saye this supper without fayth in hart holsom Iustifieth be errors, ful of maleuolence In wyllyng vs, to forget Chrystes death, tyl he come Here, ye knowe the occasion of Chrystes supper And the names of the same, to you be explicate The dyfinition, to you we dyd vtter The appostolical order, to you we delate The dew proffe, in scrypture you maye inuestygate Of Chryste geuyng his body, the intencion With the agrement of Paules text, with Christes alterate We showid/and a thankes geuing for it, til he com. For the seconde part of our songe, we haue nombryd The office of the minister, Chrystes flocke teachinge The causes also, together we haue gathered And why Chrystes flocke, this supper, oft, shuld be eating Bycause Chrystes churche is lyke a fysher repletyng His shyppe, with al kinde of fyshe: where of bad be som That the weake maye taste ioye, and the stoborne thretening To be cast out into fyer, wen the lorde doth come. Of the effectes of this supper, also ye haue harde How comfortyng they be to worthy receyuers And to other/howe greuos and full of iubarde Ye maye knowe by Iudas, and suche lyke deceuers Which receue the deuel, by there yl endeuers Of contrarys also, you haue harde a great som Where in you spye the yl workes of vnbeleuers Fouly defoyling Christes supper/before he come. Knowing that hereby Chrystes loue towarde vs is showid I admonysh, that yf thou eate it but as bread It shal helpe no more then brede, bycause thou art lewed But shal hurt the, forgettinge Christes loue and death in ded Therfore receyue chryst with thy mynd, thy soule to fede Before thou take with the mouth as a thyng y? is done So shalt thou perseue, y? chryste is thy frynde at nede Yf thou loue thy bretherne for his loue tyl he come Why it shal hurt eaten but as brede I wyl tel One ought not to eate the lordes supper as his owne With out consydering the vse, whiche is not well Christ scorged from the temple, as it is wel knowen The marchauntes, for the blasphemy that they had blowne In cauling it gods house, whiche with thinges vnholsom They had stufte: and goddes ordinance ouer throne So wyl he do those that forget him: when he doth com A meruelos thing it is, that any bouldly dorst Presume to take awaye or turne this supper pure Knowinge that those mynisters behelde a corst Yf a master commaunde thinges thus to be in vre And the seruaunt torne them: you wolde thinke I am sure He stode in his conceite, to haue a better wysdome Then his master: and could wyssyer do the cure But such wysdom shal be naught, when the lord dothe come. Suche godly ordinaunce perteyning to conscience No christen magistrate ought torne: but rather shold With al his power of swerde, be thereto a defence And it abused, redust to the pristine state ould Although the styffe neckes take neuer so stronge a houlde Then wyl god giue him this answer for his wysdom A pesable day shalt thou haue, o kinge, be bould For that thou defendest my memory, tyl I come. O most worthi supper, what grace woldest y? encreace Among vs forgetful men, in mynding Chrystes loue Yea what Charyte concord vnite and peace Yf thy trewe institucion we hadde, our hartes to moue It wold teache vs, one an others proffet to approue So it wold not be plesant, by his gracis houlsom Only for the soule, but also to oure behoue Proffytable for our bodies? tyl Chryst com. O dificile hardnes, to bring this matter to pas Through the obdurate blindnes of the owld papistri No doute, it is beyonde the strength of mannes compas But, O god, helpe our magistrates to destroy That pestelent cage of fowle birdes, and wycked fry Let them (o God) wyth michaells strength them consume That euen ouer fowle sprites, they maye haue victory To deffend the lordes memory, tyl he come. O heuenly supper of the to speke I wold end But I can not, whyle that thy worthines is met With my feruentnes, though al my brethe I shold spend Considering thy facillyte very great Most easly woldest thou bring, and in our myndes set That corps of Chryst, of whome al faythful are become The mother, with Mary a virgen most mel And so in most godly workes beare chryst, tyl he com. Euen al that do the wyl of my father, sayth chryste Be vnto me, bothe bryther, sister, and mother Here by we may se that christes body doth consyst In trewe godlines of good men and here no other The which to increse and leue betwene brother and brother Chryst gaue vs this signe of his body most holsom And grace also to receaue (I dare say forther) His mystical body remembring him to come. Seing this vse tornith men into Chrystes nature Euen as some meates alters mannes dysposition We maye calle it Chrystes body and therof be sure Which makes vs Chrystes, by faythful inquisition Of our oulde synnes, to make mortificacion Therfore, o God for thi most fatherly wysdome Now send it, for thy flockes glorificacion That they may remember thy kindnes tyl christe come. Now that our kinge Edward maye rule godly we pray And for quene Caterine, in here good state so vertuos Which my lorde protector to deffend night and daye King Edward the sixt from al enimise traytors God make the hole councell in scrypture prosperos That they may suppres antechristes faynid kingdome As god helping they wyl sprede the wyll of Iesus To stablishe, y? remembrance of Chrystes deth, tyl he comes quot.
