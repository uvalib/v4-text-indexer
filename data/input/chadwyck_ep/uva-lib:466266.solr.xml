      <field name="fulltext">To Oscar Browning To feed the soul through gilded bars Fain are the fond, and fain the kind; But where it listeth blows the wind And storms on undiscovered stars. Oh! chanced it in some alien world, Befell it in some far-off age, Our shallop took her pilgrimage Where Thames' pale current coiled and curled? When floating on,—the man, the boy,— By Eton's elms and Windsor's towers, We sowed the sweet unconscious hours Whose blossom is remembered joy! Though drifted, since that evening fled, A lifetime from those isles and weirs, Through dim amazement of the years I hold a bright, unbroken thread! Your sympathy alone was clue To labour's faintly-glimmering end, And though your faith outran me, Friend, I dedicate my work to you. Far distant now are Windsor's pile And Eton's elms; yet on we float; And hark! I hear the waves that moat The silence of Avilion's Isle! March, 1897. The Alhambra I GRANADA O land of flowers and sapphire skies, Where seraphs walk in sweet disguise Of earthly maidens' vesture! Meseems you keep within your eyes The first, vast, virginal surprise Of God's creative gesture! The Angel of Art has sealed on thee His signet and his sign,— The Alhambra! Like a phantasie, Half human, half divine! A marble fountain! Ocean shell! Or flame, that coils and spires! A perfect thought! As who should tell, In one, the World's desires! Most gorgeous Word of blazoned Art, In whose eternal scroll The student who can read a part Is Master of the whole! II LINDARAJA Within this casket was empearled, As Heaven's own Designate, A Queen; whose empire o'er the World No rival dare debate! But yet her fee of sovereignty Was not by armies ruled! Her beauty's sheen, her sovran mien,— By these men's hearts were schooled! Ah, Lindaraja! Men are blind, Or else beneath thy grace, 'Twere theirs to find the Eternal Mind, And guess the Eternal Face! III GENERALIFE Here, as if cast by pilfering fays, Are scattered Nature's gems: Her olivine, her chrysoprase, Her crowns and diadems! Scarce held the Garden God first made And gave the Man to till, More flowery lawns, more fragrant shade, Or birds of sweeter bill! Here couches Love 'mid fronded fern; Here maidens, venturing in, Achieve their liberty to learn The sacredness of sin! IV ZAMBRA Warriors, from the war returning, Cast aside the sword and lance! Zambra's myriad lamps are burning! Zambra woos with song and dance! Don the saffron robes of pleasure! Brood no more on bloody fights! Houris' arms await the pressure, Lip to lip, of amorous knights! Lo! along the enchanted alley Shines the vagueness of the moon! There the Almées dance and dally, There the lisping lovers croon! V EL CERCO They come, the Christians abhorred, Drunk with the blood of their Lord! Who shall deliver Islâm From the Cross of the red oriflamme? They pass; and destruction and dearth Follow, and crushed to the earth Lies Art! Thou wert chosen to scourge The pride of a People, to purge Their splendour, Castille, and o'erthrow The genius of Joy with the genius of Woe! VI LA SILLA DEL MORO “Farewell, farewell! Thy doom endears Thy beauty! . . . . God is just; Yet must I weep with woman's tears Thy glory in the dust! “To lose thee is to die! And yet I cling to life, for fear In death's confusion I forget How fair thou art, how dear!” So mourned Granada's latest King, Deeming that Art was dead; But still the flowers our footsteps ring And still the stars our head! To William Watson at Windermere I count thee, Watson, happier far Than we who live in foolish noise, With inharmonious minds that mar The measure of our scanty joys! From thee the inarticulate hills Expect the voice to them denied, For thee the whisper of the rills A thousand-fold is multiplied; And every tarn reflects for thee Procession of the bygone years, When clouds in hooded pageantry, Like memories, flit across the meres; The flowers reach up to kiss thine hand, The trees lean down to touch thine head, The birds acclaim thee; all the land Is conscious of a poet's tread! All seems aloof from mortal pain; Thou communest with all in song, Clear-welling with a purer strain Than ever flowed from human wrong. O happy in the woodland maze! O happy on the mountain steep! But we are locked in wilder ways, And alien from the hills of sleep! No “rivulets dance,” no torrents flow, No “forests muse” of pine or oak; We marvel if a floweret blow Beneath a heaven so smeared with smoke. And here no joyous impulse moves The minds of men with random waves, But up and down these stony grooves We hurry, like a gang of slaves. Ah, vainly would'st thou bend to hear, Or vainly would'st thou strain to see The mystic Spirit bards revere Of Nature's prodigality! A giant, clanking golden chains; A monster, bound in torments fierce; Whose strong integument of pains No shaft of joy is keen to pierce; What more than this can poet spy Beneath our brave pretence and show? 'Tis light to lift, that bravery, That broidered coverlid of woe! And yet perchance I do thee wrong; Perchance, beneath immediate ill, Thy clearer insight, trained and strong, May catch a deeper vision still: Maybe, though greeting Nature's face In cloud and crag, in lake and glen, At least her footsteps thou canst trace Among the meaner ways of men! Maybe, her paths by thee discerned, Are less obscure than sages deem; The poet's prescience having learned What Science only dares to dream: That Nature is not twain or trine; Though none know whither, none know whence Her journey, yet no less divine Is sense, than things perceived by sense. But take thou the unfinished thought, To mould it, in some later lay, By finer inspiration wrought, And sing me all I fail to say; Let not the cloistral peaks bar out Profaner creatures from thy ken, Or fold thee from the faith and doubt Of common minds and fellow men! Though Windermere thy heart allure, Or Rydal, with her sacred hills, Forget not whom the towns immure To turn the cranks and tread the mills! London. July, 1897. To I. Albeniz I cannot say what I would say; My eyes are filled with tears, dear friend; Because our life must pass away And all our sweetest moments end. But yet this privilege is ours, That hand in hand we twain have trod The maze of Art's authentic bowers, And walked with Love and talked with God. England and America I PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE, DECEMBER, 1895 Yes! it was well, and passing well, that we— To do their pleasure—for so small a thing, Refused to set wild war upon the wing, Or to defile that unensanguined sea, That flows between our Countries of the Free, With freight of fratricide! We let them ring Alarum; kept us crimeless; and shall bring White record to the days that are to be! The time will come, when they will look with shame On that time-serving message of their Chief; His use ignoble of their noble name For paltry purpose, must be charged with grief For the harvest of their Age, when every sheaf Is garnered of their folly and their fame. II THE ARBITRATION TREATY, JANUARY, 1897 “How beautiful the feet of them that bring Good tidings o'er the mountains, news of peace!” So cried the Hebrew prophet, long release From long captivity previsioning. And Cyrus came, with healing on his wing For Israel; but not by Persia, Greece, Nor Rome, God made the world from war to cease; No, nor by Christ, nor any Christian King! But England, watching by her moated main, Yet tasting in convergent winds the taint Of slaughter and the tears of those that weep The tyranny of battle, hears again, With spiritual ear, the far and faint Footfall divine, that treads the “untrampled deep.” III THE AMERICAN SENATE'S AMENDMENT More right divine, perchance, ye arrogate Than Kings anointed; yet ye little prove Your title to investiture of Love, Which is Divinity; but consecrate To enmity ye seem! For when, as late, Peace left awhile her heavenly Ark, that hove A little nearer Earth, the gentle dove Could find no harbour in your flood of hate. Hither and thither dark confusions smite, In maddened chivalry of pride and pelf; The nations of the world, like factions fight, As reasonless as Ghibelline and Guelph: Yet Earth has never seen a viler sight Than this vile war ye wage on Peace herself! March, 1897. America's Declaration of War, 1898 The sly Freebooters of the Earth Open their ranks, to welcome in The youngest Race God brought to birth, By serpent reasons lured to sin. “Peace and goodwill”—the promise failed As soon as made, erased with gore; And once again the Christ is haled Behind the reeking wheels of War! Revelation Man is a pilgrim; in ambiguous ways And twilight days, By endless revelation led along, An endless song Of aspiration and of hope he sings; To which our strings, O minstrels, let us tune, and time our staves To match those waves And tides of choiring voices, that profound As many waters sound. What though some discord of suspended pain Distress the strain? Some dissonance of unresolved desires Torment the wires? These are the unripe buds upon the tree Of harmony; The sunbeams of the summer solstice lack Not bars of black, And life would be no more than senseless breath Without the sense of death. Moreover there is one persistent voice That cries, “Rejoice!” 'Tis Love's; and, as he sings, all other sound Comes circling round, And all the trembling notes, like lonely elves, Submit themselves To his supreme persuadence. Incomplete Although so sweet, Even his melody. Because it flows For ever, without close. “O Sing unto the Lord a New Song” Oft to the men of battle poets raise An ode of praise, And oft the choric epitaph they rear Above the bier Of valour,—resolute, without disdain, Though godly Spain, Invincible, in cannon-freighted keel, From Cadiz steal, Or godless France her flaming fingers lave In Egypt's wave, And yellowing harvest-fields of Belgium beat With blood-bedabbled feet. And oft to Love the Muses will return From themes more stern, To build a stately altar to his name, And feed his flame With thrice-distilléd oils of simple joy, Unwont to cloy; That there with hushed and hesitating feet May lovers meet, And learn the secret of his mystic power,— That the only flower Of perfect chastity proceeds From mutual passion's wingéd seeds. Alas! why strike we no sublimer string, Nor dare to sing Jehovah, and his mercies manifold, Renowned of old In Judah's temple? where, like seraphim's Majestic hymns, Antiphonies 'neath cedarn arches rolled, To harps of gold And dulcimers; while damsels, dancing round, Shook forth the timbrel's sound. When erst, O God, the Hebrew minstrel tried From thee to hide, In vain 'neath muffling canopies of night He shunned thy sight, In vain o'er ocean-solitudes was borne On wings of morn; Beyond the universe's utmost bound Thy face he found, Beyond the stars and light's extremest belt Thy presence felt; For when he turned from thee and fled, Thy spirit followed not, but led. But now the shelvéd record of the rocks The psalmist mocks; Before thy motion at primeval dawn A veil is drawn Of countless ages; down a myriad links Creation sinks Through teeming generations, swarm on swarm, From form to form! The abyss is void of thee, and back we reel And vainly feel The stars,—if in the heavens may linger One impress of their maker's finger! Yet, though thou dwell'st not in the empyrean, We raise our pæan To thee, who ridest not the wind nor storm, Whom neither form Nor hue reveals, nor substance can contain, Nor symbol vain! To thee, who art not God of sect or race, Of land or place, Of century or era, age or æon, We raise our solemn pæan! Sing, every voice, that never chanted spell To cozen hell, Nor sought by adulation, born of fear, To charm God's ear! Blow, trumpets, blow, that shatter to the ground, With sevenfold sound, The walls of superstition and offence Against God's sense; And ye, that live by love's harmonious law, Soft music draw, With fingers fleet, from lyre and lute, Like forest rain, when winds are mute! Eternally revealed, yet never known, Thee, thee we own! From man's false images of thee are cast The shadows vast Of doubt and dread, that lie upon his mind So black inclined! Yet shadows are but measures of the light; The darkest night Is but the token of the sun withdrawn, The promise of a dawn. Psalm XC From æon to æon Ere the mountains were born Thou art God! Thou turnest the sons of the earthborn, Thou turnest back mortals to dust. For in thine eyes a thousand years lapsing Are past as a watch in the night! We blossom as herbs in the morning, That are mown down and withered at eve! Our days die away as a murmur, And thy fury has finished our years! How foolish our boasting and travail! In vanity born to take flight! O learn us our life-days to number, That wisdom may home to our hearts. Mors, Morituri Te Salutamus! I hate thee, Death! Not that I fear thee,—more than mortal sprite Fears the dark entrance, whence no man returns; For who would not resign his scanty breath, Unreal joy, and troublesome delight, To marble coffer or sepulchral urn's Inviolate keeping? To quench the smouldering lamp, that feebly burns Within his chamber, to procure sweet sleeping, Is not a madman's act. And yet I hate thee, Swift breaker of life's poor illusion, Stern ender of love's fond confusion, And with rebellion in my heart await thee. Like mariners we sail, of fate unwist, With orders sealed and only to be read When home has faded in the morning mist And simple faith and innocence are fled! Oft we neglect them, being much dismayed By phantoms and weird wonders That haunt the deep, By voices, winds, and thunders, Old mariners that cannot pray nor weep, And faces of drowned souls that cannot sleep! Or else our crew is mutinous, arrayed Against us, and the mandate is delayed. But when the forces that rebelled Are satisfied or quelled; When sails are trimmed to catch the merry wind, And billows dance before and foam behind; Free, free at last from tumult and distraction Of pleasure beckoned and of pain repelled,— Free from ourselves and disciplined for action,— We break the seal of destiny, to find The bourne or venture for our cruise designed, Then, at that very moment, hark! a cry On deck; and then a silence, as of breath Held. In the offing, low against the sky, Hoves thy black flag! . . . Therefore I hate thee, Death! The verb “to hove” is no doubt a little archaic. Perhaps it dropped out of use from the natural confusion with the preterite of “heave” (which I have used on page 16), corresponding with that between “lay” and the preterlte of “lie.” “Hove” is connected with “hover.” It is constantly used by Malory; and Gower, Chaucer, and Spenser employ it. It seems to me too good a word to be lost—by poets, at least. The Inquest Not labour kills us; no, nor joy: The incredulity and frown, The interference and annoy, The small attritions wear us down. The little gnat-like buzzings shrill, The hurdy-gurdies of the street, The common curses of the will— These wrap the cerements round our feet. And more than all, the look askance Of loving souls that cannot gauge The numbing touch of circumstance, The heavy toll of heritage. It is not Death, but Life that slays: The night less mountainously lies Upon our lids, than foolish day's Importunate futilities! Col. Gerard Noel Money, C.B. Hadst thou not died I would not ask to ride By Death's pale side; But since thou art a corse, I ride by his white horse And wish Life's black battalions woe betide! Thou in no case Wert servant of disgrace, But ever sett'st thy face With that much merrier part Of honour and good heart: Therefore with thee and Death I choose to pace. Thomas Ashe In disappointed loneliness A gentle bard has passed away, Who for no guerdon would betray The mission of a bard,—to bless; Too late, too late shall we confess We need the rills of song that stray With fringe of flowerets faintly gay, Not only streams of strain and stress. But now our jaded taste disdains Forget-me-not and water-cress, The rose of cultivated pains And passions to our lips we press, We scarcely notice when there wanes A soul of simple tenderness. Jan., 1890 Beside a Grave Thou hast passed away into darkness, No more may I see thy face, And the dead world in its starkness Is my appointed place. What art thou, dear? An essence, A vapour, a nothing? Or one Absorbed in a mightier Presence, A sun swallowed up by a sun? What wert thou, dear, when beside me Thy feet kept an equal pace With mine? A dream to deride me With false, ephemeral grace? Had love then his final fruition? Is blossoming-time outwrought? Was the worth of our intuition Of immortality nought? “The Days that are no more” The torpid night has filled the languid air With breath of roses lulled with dew to sleep, The murmurous bees are housed in honeyed lair, And nothing wakes except the hearts that weep. O days that are no more, seen down long aisles And avenues of time, where trembling light Dimples the world with universal smiles, In home, in childhood, when all care was slight; O days that are no more, come yet again! Come with your snowy drapery and your dream! Waft me the fragrance of your summer rain, Bring me your flowers, unveil your morning beam! Come yet again! . . . But there shall never be Such days again; for these no sweetness store, These do not come with happiness to me, These are not like the days that are no more! Rest Sometimes it seems true happiness can dwell Only where thought and contemplation weave Uninterrupted webs; to take our leave For ever of the world in cloistered cell, With no distraction save the solemn bell That summons dead and living; not to grieve For slaughtered summer-times beyond reprieve, And all the ill that never can be well; Each day to worship at the heavenly throne, Which for our weakling sense we symbolise By the proportioned stateliness of stone,— Long glades of column and of arch, that rise All-resonant with untumultuous tone;— Sometimes this seems the only worthy prize. “He that is without Sin” What is her value if Affection stint Her confidence, for every dubious deed? What is a cord if it should snap at need? Or shield, if it should shatter at a dint? Go, pious! tithe your cummin and your mint,— The cheap rebuke, love sacrificed to creed,— And gather up your skirts with careful heed,— Lest precious self should catch an evil hint! Fair saints, that are more Christ-like than the Christ, More virgin than the Maid Immaculate, Whose kisses and embraces are unpriced, Save by an offer of the marriage state, The eye that watches is the eye enticed! The sins men hunt they never truly hate. Any Father to Any Son For thee a crown of thorns I wear, And thought imperative constrains My labouring heart for thee to bear The travail of a woman's pains; For with intolerable preságe Of all the amazements of thy life, The pits of ancient woe I guage, The vast impediments of strife; Or else in dreadful dreaming cast, I see thy form before me fly, By prescience never overpast Nor fleetest foot that love can ply. Still as thy shadow must I run, When all the shadows fall behind, And in the rich seductive sun Thou to the darker bars art blind. Children Watch with me and listen By the sweet enchanted bowers, Where the children dance with children, hand in hand! Bright their blue eyes glisten Like the dew-besprinkled flowers, When the morning stoops to kiss the sleeping land! Hear the laughter flowing, Like a brook's melodious bubble, From the happy heart of boy and girl at play! Clouds o'erhead are blowing That are charged with tears of trouble; But the winds of God shall drive them on, to-day. Dancing to the measure Of benignant music's rapture, How the melody their eagerness controls! Lo! the sprite of pleasure We so vainly strive to capture Is the playmate and companion of their souls! Stodham Woods I cannot tell where I have been, This sweet fore-noon, with tempered tune, Or worthy of the scene. This is the time when fresh primroses Are in the forefront of Spring posies, And nestling down between their groups The violet stoops, While still along the byway shine Spring's natal stars, the celandine. Though the blackthorn's bloom is set, Braving the chill breeze's bite With blossom white, Bracken-curls are stubborn yet! Save those splashes of pale flowers, Born in March, of April-showers, The woods are brown, and dead leaves choke the bowers. So Nature seems to hesitate Ere she assume her summer state; Such buds are there that long to bloom, Such glows impatient of the gloom; So much there seems in act to sing, Such wistfulness, such preluding! I wandered where these pleasures meet; The mossy path beneath my feet As in a girdle clasped the hill, Along whose base a tinkling rill With gentle flood Was whispering to the whispering wood. Perchance it fears the open field, That stretches to the seaward Downs, And seeks in forest arms to shield Its shyness from the proffered crowns, The sun-enamelled green and gold, Of meadows amorously bold. Perchance—But ah! my spirit faints In presence of these woodland saints! Divinity of flower and tree, And musing water's minstrelsy, The building bird's hilarity, The thrill, the frolic, and the glee,— With these we hold no parity! They foil the bards that master me! The Rother O river, flowing by the house Where dwells my patient mother, I bend to thee, I whisper close,— Oh hear me, whispering Rother! Faster than thou the time has slid Since first I strolled beside thee, But thou hast journeyed as God bid And therefore joys betide thee! While I have run a wayward course; My moods have kept no season; Breaking the channel of my source To follow Rhyme and Reason! But thou, where cattle love to browse And doves call one another, Flow on, dear river, by the house Where dwells my patient mother! Ingens Aequor “The huge various monotonies, the fervent and fluent colours, the vast limits, the fresh sonorous strength, the certain confusion and tumultuous law, the sense of windy and weltering space, the intense refraction of shadow and light, the crowded life and inanimate intricacy, the patience and the passion of the sea.—A. C. Swinburne. “Essay on William Blake.” Come hither, O exquisite thought! Come hither, O splendour of words! Let a texture be woven and wrought, Not to picture the flocks and the herds, Not to celebrate forest or mead, The loitering lapse of the rill, The lisp of the breeze in the reed, Or the gush of the wind on the hill, The crypt of the midnight empearled With the stars and the planets above, The boisterous fame of the world, Or the passionate silence of love,— But in praise of the Sea; that immense And vague glory of waters amassed; That beauty transcending the sense, Like a mirage, elusive and vast; With shadow and image of cloud, That palpitate, purple or pale, With furrows of emerald, ploughed By the murmuring, odorous gale; With marvel of sunlight and mist, With magic of mutable form, With music of “wild waves whist,” And slow subsidence of storm. O chiming monotonous change! O changeless melodious beat! O refluent rhythmical range Of fairy invisible feet! The nations may traverse and trace A populous path o'er the wave, And with militant messages lace The floor of the mariner's grave; The peaks of the virginal snows May be pierced for the clambering car; The cleavage of ocean will close, And his wounds have a transient scar! The groves of the forest may fall, The rivers grow black with the shame Of their burden, the skies with their pall Of the sulphurous refuse of flame; War may trample o'er hill and o'er dale, Trade may bruise all the fields with her tread, The billow records not the trail Of humanity, living or dead! Unpolluted are channel and main, Their breezes are fragrant and free; Man cannot impress with his pain The fugitive foam of the sea! At Cimiez These olive-woods and orange-groves, These tulips, harlequins of glee, Yon flecks of cloud, like woolly droves, Across the blue immensity,— This ancient ilex, sombre green, The hill where stood Diana's shrine, The shimmering waters' distant sheen,— Touch they your heart? They cannot mine! Man takes not Nature for his Saint, Her beauty is no more his creed; The very breezes bear a taint Of his insatiable greed. As gladly, gluttonous for gain, He digs the flowers and fells the trees, So would he foul the sapphired main Or tear the heavenly tapestries! An Impression A sound of the sea is in my ears, Of the sea that knows no rest; His muttering boughs the willow rears, For a wind is in the west. A wind was born in the western sky When the day was wed to night, For bridals and birth the torch flared high In the day-god's halls of light. I stand on the river-shore alone, And I gaze on the lordly scene, On vanishing sun, and rising moon, And the sable girth between. Perfume In love's delightful hours We passed the mignonette And plucked the blue-eyed flowers That bade us Not Forget; But now the blue-eyed flowers We pass and we forget; The scent of those dear hours Comes back with mignonette! A Ballad of Cornwall See Malory's Morte d'Arthur, Bk. IX., ch. xxi. (Globe Edition). Sir Tristram lay by a well, Making sad moan; Fast his tears fell; For wild the wood through, Stricken with shrewd Sorrow he ran, When he deemed her untrue— La Beale Isoud! For he loved her alone. So as he lay Wasted and wan, Scarce like a man, Pricking that way His lady-love came, With her damsels around, And her face all aflame With the breezes of May; While a brachet beside her Still bayed the fair rider, Still leaped up and bayed her; A small scenting hound That Sir Tristram purveyed her. So she rode on; But the brachet behind Hung snuffing the wind; Till seeking and crying Faster and faster, Beside the well lying She found her dear master! Then licking his ears And cheeks wet with tears, For joy never resting, Kept whining and questing. Isoud (returned, Seeking her hound) Soon as she learned Tristram was found, Straightway alighting, Fell in a swound. When, by her lover Won to recover, Isoud was lying Pale and complying, Who shall the greeting Tell of their meeting? Joy, by no tongue E'er to be sung, Passed in that plighting! Thus while they dallied, Forth the wood sallied An horrible libbard, and bare The brachet away to his lair! The Riddle Love, o'er-fond of straying, Met with Kitty maying,— Straight began this saying: “Maiden, tell me truly What is Love?” And duly Kitty made reply: “Ask of girls unruly! Nought of Love know I!” Then said he: “Beseech you Tarry while I teach you!” On a bank sat Kitty, While he sang this ditty; “Kin to all, yet kinless! Sin of all, yet sinless! Passion's purple festal! Passion's proudest vestal! Artist that can mould you Till the selves that hold you No more form nor fold you! Both divine and human; Far to seek, yet common; Babbled of the many, Hardly known of any! Waving wings of feather, Yet with strength to tether Life and Death together!” While he sang these snatches, Down from russet thatches Sparrows fly and buntings; Martins, swifts, and swallows, Whom the South wind follows, Leave their mazy huntings; Warblers crowd the willows; While along the shallows Trouts and graylings glisten; Larks on cloudy billows, Softly as on pillows, Lay their songs, to listen! Every stalk of clover Turns its head to hear him; Buttercups lean over, Striving to be near him; Foxglove, fringing hedges, Tilts her fairy flagon, While from leafy ledges Butterfly and dragon Lean, and emmet-peoples (Careless now of thrushes), Whom the grass o'er-steeples, Perch on reeds and rushes! Paddock, newt, and lizard, Mole and vole and rabbit Fear no more the wizard Snake in emerald habit; Charmed he lies; but drowsing Owls in eyries waken; While the fields of browsing Cattle are forsaken! Creatures throng delighted,— Running, creeping, winging! . . . Only Kitty slighted Love's old-fashioned singing! She alone, that ditty Hearing, dared to flout it; “Love?” she cried: “'tis pity Nought you know about it!” The Eternal Conflict Written for the Opera “Pepita Jiménez,” composed by Señor Albeniz, performed at Prague in 1897, and founded on Juan Valera's novel of that name, first made known in England by Mr. Coventry Patmore in his Religio Poetæ. Luis Refined and penetrated By God's refulgent fire, In body separated, Our spirits shall aspire, In holy love embracing, The mystic mount to climb, Beyond the sin enchasing, Beyond the reach of Time; Until those purple petals Round Love Divine involved, Intense as molten metals, Saints, martyrs, and absolved, In Paradise expanding, All pain with peace allay, That passes understanding, And none can take away! Pepita Alas! I cannot follow Your spirit in its flight! Such Love to me seems hollow And empty of delight! I love your very vesture, Your shadow and your name; I love your voice and gesture,— Your self! and feel no shame! The folly of my senses Can Death alone efface! For Love in fond offences Finds sacramental grace! My heart, though clayed and clodded, Has flowered without a stain! Pepita disembodied Must be Pepita slain! The Homily Written for the Opera “Pepita Jiménez,” composed by Señor Albeniz, performed at Prague in 1897, and founded on Juan Valera's novel of that name, first made known in England by Mr. Coventry Patmore in his Religio Poetæ. Who preaches Love is wrong No flower must ever see, Nor hear the song-bird's song Deride his homily! Who teaches Love was made Accurs'd, must never be Where all the summer glade Derides his homily! How foolish Man's arraignment Of Love, whose strength of mirth Enforces an enchainment On the sorrow of the Earth! Love at First Sight Love at first sight, be true Once, in the world's despite! Once, in a season due, Souls that are kin unite! Once let our hearts pursue Trace of a lost delight! Love at first sight, be true! Love at the first sweet sight! Love as of old appear! Now, though the world be cold! Now, though the cynic sneer, Soul into soul enfold! Now to the world endear Passion instead of gold! Love as of old appear! Love, as they loved of old! Pure Imagination She lies in her little room And all around her creep The quietness and gloom And the sacredness of sleep. My spirit breaks the seals Of jealous night's duress, And close beside her steals To watch her loveliness. There droops her flower-like head, Petalled and rayed with curls! An aster of golden-red The leafage of night enfurls! Ah me! She lies in her couch Like a babe on its mother's breast; And my spirit is fain to crouch Back to its lone unrest. The Singer's Search In vain o'er all the land I wander Still far from me my darling hies, In vain I sing my ditties tender, I hear but echo's mocking cries! Ah! lonely, lonely through the world I wander; Red o'er the hills I see the morning rise, And happy creatures wake, Love's hours to squander, Till charmed to sleep, by night's enchanting eyes; Still lonely, lonely through the world I wander, And like a shadow, Love before me flies! In vain I search through every city, Still far from me my darling hies; In vain I sing my tender ditty, She never to my voice replies! Ah! lonely, lonely through the sleepless city, Amid the jostling crowd a minstrel sighs; The seekers after pleasure gaze with pity, The seekers after wealth with scornful eyes; Still lonely, lonely through the sleepless city I follow Love, and Love before me flies. At Last At last, my love, thou comest, though so late; Upon thy bosom I retrieve some hours; There is a scent again of summer flowers, Surviving the first breath of winter's hate: Thy voice that never chides me, though ingrate, Is like the song of joy-birds in their bowers Not yet deserted, though the blossom showers, And all the gadding breezes whisper Fate. Yet, O my love, where wert thou in the days When I was searching all the summer long On sultry plains and barren mountain ways? Why did I never hear thy trysting song? Ah! long, lost hours, worn out in sad amaze! Scarce for Time's gift can I forgive his wrong! Nellie When shadows are breaking And dawn is at hand, When morning is making New mirth in the land, No fairer it brightens Than, pure of all blame, The soul that enlightens Your face with its flame! The world, vainly asking, May peer in your eyes For modesty masking Or truth in disguise; There innocence dwelling Returns, like a dove The serpent repelling, A look full of love! Moieties It seems most strange that thou and I Should not have met in years gone by; It seems most strange that souls so mated To long disunion should be fated. Few, few indeed, dare trust their bark Upon life's waters deep and dark With hope to find a land of rest, An isle by Cytherea blest. Perhaps few need or seek for more Than coasting by their native shore, Where they may gain in many a cove Safe anchor, unpresumptuous love! The few that great ideals cherish On mountains and in deserts perish, Fringed by delusive herbs and trees, That beckon to the homeless seas. Upon the sand they thrust their prow, They stake life's treasure on the throw; The hungry sea comes up behind, Before them shrieks the desert wind! How happy, if on waste or mountain An unsuspected vale or fountain The wanderer find! More happy he, If there he meet a nymph like thee; Who never learnt 'neath Christian spires The virtue of concealed desires, Nor tainted with a careful coldness The purity of true love's boldness; Nor yet destroyed love's heavenly fruit By plucking up his earthly root, Nor set up Principle above The larger principle of Love! Predestination Written for the Opera “Pepita Jiménez,” composed by Señor Albeniz, performed at Prague in 1897, and founded on Juan Valera's novel of that name, first made known in England by Mr. Coventry Patmore in his Religio Poetæ. Ah yes! Ah yes! I had my dream! Fantastical creations! Down roaring street, by rustic stream, In fairy habitations! Some bore a mild and modest mien, And some behaved more lightly, And others hovered just between The saintly and the sprightly. But God, to guard the senses, set A form of finer essence Within my heart; before we met I learnt to love your presence! Deep calls to deep and flame to flame! Afar, my spirit owned you; I saw you long before you came, And welcomed and enthroned you! Soul to Soul These eyes where laughing Loves recline, These lips that just divided pout To let the fluttering kisses out, Like birds from Love's own shrine,— To pain or please You gave me these; But still I ask, will You be mine? In weal or woe, in Love's eternal bond, In life and death, and all that lies beyond, Will You be mine? These glances that so ardent shine, These words that come with reckless rout And rush of passion thronging out, Sweet vows at Love's own shrine,— To pain or please You give me these; But still I ask, will You be mine? In weal or woe, in Love's eternal bond, In life and death, and all that lies beyond, Will You be mine? For Ever I joy or grieve Alone for thee! Like birds in mating feather, When nests they weave In wonted tree, Our spirits cleave Together! Though death removes And grants no grace To all love's dear endeavour, It still behooves My soul to chase My only love's For ever! Aliquid Amari I heard a sailor singing, as he leaned against the shrouds; The ocean fled beneath him and above him flew the clouds; And the breezes moaned in answer, and the voices of the main: “However happy Love may be, the core of Love is pain.” The breezes learnt the burden, and murmured to the land; The sailor's wife was sitting in her cottage by the strand; And when she heard them whisper, her heart replied again: “However happy Love may be, the core of Love is pain.” They left the woman weeping and hurried to the town, Where gallant lads and ladies were walking up and down; To each they told their message, and all confessed it plain: “However happy Love may be, the core of Love is pain.” Then hearken, all ye lovers! Be mindful, when ye meet, To promise nought or little ere this proverb ye repeat; Ye surely shall have proof thereof; ye shall not speak in vain: “However happy Love may be, the core of Love is pain.” Fervaal The Opera by Vincent d'Indy. My verses are intended for an epitome of the meaning of this great work, which has never appeared in England. Higher and higher, O Human Race, The Law of Sex shall lead thee on; The glory of the Eternal Face,— The Father, Mother, and the Son. Thou shalt not leave the joy behind, But wilful pleasure shall grow less, When thou hast learnt the impassioned mind Of Love in all his loveliness; When thou from dread of lust art free, The secret of Religion's rule, When thou hast lawful liberty And all thy teachers are at school. The Woman-Spirit leads the Man; Higher and higher I see them climb, The pilgrims of a trackless plan, Among the folded hills of Time. Epitaphs Dante Crooning Earth has cradled well Me that plunged to crypts of Hell, Me that climbed the heavenly dome, Wearied out and welcomed home. Keats Not “in water,”—but the flood That with passionate impulse beats! Every youthful poet's blood Spells the sacred name of Keats. A Fool Stranger, stay! yet shed no tear; For a fool lies buried here; Yet, since he unfinished lies, God in time may make him wise. A Wise Man Stranger, weep! Beneath this stone Lies a man for knowledge known: Yet, since he was wholly wise, God forbade him Paradise. A Fair Woman In this green chest is laid away The fairest frock she ever wore; It clothed her both by night and day, And none shall wear it evermore. An Infant This sweet infant never knew What a woman's lips can do! Yet a woman's lips no less Brought him to this loneliness. A Wife Once I learnt in wilful hour How to vex him; still I keep, Now unwilfully, my power: Every day he comes to weep. A Soul Underneath this turvéd mould Lies a creature late unsouled: Birds of paradise contrive Ill in crystal cage to thrive. A Waif Hither was she brought unknown; Now to love and knowledge grown, She has journeyed back alone. Beaten In the arms of Death I curled, Unadjusted to the World: All too fierce the World has proved, Because I loved, because I loved.</field>
