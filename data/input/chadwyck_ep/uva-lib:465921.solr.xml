      <field name="fulltext">Poetical Remains OF Richardson Pack, Esq. Written in the Year 1727. TO Miss COLLETON. The Author became enamoured with this Lady at Exeter, in the Year 1725; and in his Second Volume of Miscellanies, then publish'd, celebrates her under the Appellation of the Western Wonder. The First Copy of Verses in that Collection, Ad Libellum, is Addressed to Her, and the last Copy in the Book regrets her being Mortal. Soon after this Separation the Lady Married. Occasioned by her demanding back her Letters, and a Ring she gave him. [I] Regardless of your Vows and mine, Since you've recall'd the Heart you gave, With Ease fair Colle' I resign. Those other Toys that grac'd your Slave. II The wanton Ringlets of your Hair, As Chains and Ornaments Vincula Ornamenta the Motto of a Ring of her Hair. I wore; Releas'd from Love's bewitching Snare, Those slighter Bands can charm no more. III Take back each soft, fond, billet Doux; Attested by your Virgin Name; How tender seems each Word and true! But Words and Thoughts are not the same. IV Your Lips spoke fonder Things than they In Kisses printed on my Breast; May those Impressions wear away, Since Venus'-Dove forsakes her Nest. V Yet tho' your am'rous Glances play, Like dazling Sun-beams here, and there; Tho' all your Hours fly light and gay, Without one Cloud of gloomy Care; VI Ah! Much I fear, forgetful Maid; You'll in your Turn ere-long complain, By some more fav'rite Youth betray'd, Whose Flatt'ry now may make you vain. VII If such a Tryal you should prove, My gen'rous Passion then would shine; To your Relief with Zeal I'd move, Revenge your Wrongs, nor think of mine. ON Reading Tibullus. Alluding to the foregoing Separation. Ah Crudele genus! nec fidum fœmina Nomen. Tib. Lib. 3. Hail happy Shade! thou bright Elysian Guest. Midst tuneful Bards and faithful Lovers blest: Who living didst a thousand Charms display; Rich, Witty, Graceful, Elegant, and Gay. Non tu corpus eras sine Pectore, Di tibi formam, Di tibi divitias dederant, artemque fruendi. Hor. Ep. 4. Lib. 1. When I survey Thee, thro' thy shining Page, Inflam'd with Love by Turns and jealous Rage, Yet decent still, well manner'd, and polite, From fulsom Flatt'ry free, or meaner Spite; (For gently, even thy Reproaches fall, And in thy Spleen thou seem'st to have no Gall) So soft the Subject, and so sweet the Song, My Soul insensibly is borne along: By secret Sympathy with Thee combin'd, Thy Joys and Sorrows all affect my Mind. Tho' Fate so far our Persons did divide, Our Souls, methinks, in Genius are ally'd; Nature alike did either Breast inspire, With melting Tenderness and warm Desire; Melting as Snows that fall from southern Skies, And warm as Odours which from Incense rise. Thee have I chose (and let the Choice commend. My Taste) both as an Author and a Friend. Often I've sought the Silence of the Grove, To hear thy moving Tales and Plaints of Love. Then fondly took my gentle Poet's Part; Felt all his Passions fluctuate in my Heart; And, sighing! rav'd against th'ungrateful Maid, By whom such Truth, such Merit, was betray'd. And false Neæra! The Name of a Roman Lady, of whom Tibullus was passionately enamoured, and he had been favoured, and jilted, both by her. lovely perjur'd Dear Perfida, nec merito nobis inimica, merenti Perfida, sed quamvis perfida, cara tamen. Tib. Eleg. 7. Lib. 3. Perfidious Maid! I ne'er deserv'd this Ill; False as you are—tho' false, yet lovely still. Dart. How kind you were, but ah, how insincere! Hard Lot of Us whom Beauty taught to sing? From our obliging Cares our Suff'rings spring. While we with Verse adorn our Fav'rite's Charms, We recommend Her to some Rival's Arms: To vain Parade the fickle-Fair invite, And guide dull Fops by our Poetic Light; Till modest Sense, o'erpower'd by Dress and Noise, Will praise the Toast a Coxcomb oft enjoys. A LETTER from Exmouth, Axmouth, or, Exmouth, a venerable old Haven, situate on the East-Side of the River Axe, or Ex, near Exeter. TO Mr. TITTLEY, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Secretary to Mr. Hedges at the Court of Turin. While my soft Hours steal on with downy Feet, And daily new successive Joys I meet; From various Objects, that by turns conspire, Alike to raise and gratify Desire; Yet not unmindful of an absent Friend, To Thee—dear Tittley—I my Thoughts commend. To Thee, who free from Business and from Strife. Tread the smooth Paths of Philosophic Life, Chearful and wise may'st thou still persevere, Nor think a giddy World e'er worth thy Care. Tho' Paint and Sculpture here their Gifts refuse, Nor op'ning Palaces invite my Muse; See Addison's Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy, 1703. The noble Treats of Harmony she finds, And sweetest Music of according Minds, Where all the Charities of social Life, Contend to please with amiable Strife. A well-spread Table to my Taste supplies, With decent Plenty all that's good or nice; And the rich Juice of Gallia's gen'rous Vine, Or racy Cyder, emulous of Wine, To many a sprightly Turn and Joke gives Birth, Nor drowns our Reason whilst it flows our Mirth. Then Books and Walks divide the vacant Time, Unconscious all of Folly or of Crime. No lofty Tow'rs in awful Pride look down; Nor Church nor Tholsel grace the Fisher-Town: One antique Chapel Formerly belonging to the Abbot of Sion. on a rising Land, Looks as it stood a Light-House from the Strand. Here the rough Sailor on a Sabbath-Day, Forgets to Swear, and surly learns to Pray: Rows of neat Cottages are plac'd below, And the lov'd Villa crowns the rural Show, Whose sloping Gardens from on High survey, The distant Mountains, and the neighb'ring Sea. And wheresoe'er around the Sight is fixt, It meets some varied Prospect sweetly mixt: Here the fierce Ex Potius Axe. drives on with rapid Force. O'er Shelves and Rocks obnoxious to its Course: There Hills and Groves are cheer'd by Western Gales, And Venus' Myrtle blooms in all the Vales. O! That with Addison my Muse could vie, This happy Spot should rival Italy. Once, heretofore, in this delicious Clime, I past the Season of the flow'ry Prime; Respir'd each Morn the Balmy vernal Air, And breath'd it out again in Praise and Pray'r: (For I am none of those, who think it poor, To thank the God that gracious gave the Store; Dull rather they, who never felt the Fires, Th'exalted Joys which Gratitude inspires.) But tho' th'inverted Year declining low'rs, And the bleak Clouds descend in wintry Show'rs; Eliza's Charms Miss Colleton. enliven so the Scene, As if no change of Seasons here had been: Her Eyes alone to me can well supply, The Light and Heat that's wanting in the Sky. Ah! would kind Love secure me this Retreat And make my Wishes in her Arms compleat, Int'rest should tempt, and Glory court in vain, And Pride and Luxury unenvied Reign. As up the steepy Cliff I lately climb'd, To breathe my Muse (for by the Height sublim'd Fancy takes Wing, and spreads her airy Flight, O'er Earth, and Ocean, and the Realms of Light.) Sudden I heard a rising Tempest roar, And the swoln Surges burst upon the Shoar; When lo! A Barque that whilom was so trim, It seem'd the Surface of the Main to skim; Became the Sport of ev'ry Wave and Wind, Offer'd, methought, an Emblem to my Mind, Of those Advent'rers on Ambition's Coast, By Projects Shipwreck'd, or in Factions tost. How blest, said I (and only blest is He) Who never sails on Fortune's faithless Sea Or if by Force, himself engag'd he find, Trusts Virtue with the Steerage of his Mind; Nor, while mad Hurricanes the World embroil, Promotes the Ruin to divide the Spoil; Looks down on Titles with superior State, And dares be Honest, rather than be Great; Firm and collected in himself can stand, Nor acts, nor speaks, as others would Command. Prepar'd for any Fate to which he's Born, To wear a Laurel-Crown, or one of Thorn. But what is this that strikes my ravish'd Ear; Sure 'tis the Voice of Her I love so dear! Wonder not then, I thus abruptly end, And for my Mistress quit my Muse and Friend. Dec. 12. 1737. R. P. AN EPISTLE from ABERDEEN An ancient Episcopal See, and made an University by King James I; about 70 Miles North of Edinburgh., TO HIS GRACE JOHN Duke of Argyll. September 4. 1728. Dives, inops, Romæ, seu fons ita jusserit exul; Quisquis erit Vitæ scribam color ? Hor. Sat. 1. Lib. 2. When you, my Lord, these Moral-Strains shall read, You'll think me re-baptiz'd within the Tweed: No Kirk-Professor graver could declaim, Were some prim Sister's Body brought to shame. I, who was wont in am'rous Airs to sing, The rival Charms of Colleton and Spring; (In one respect, the Rivals did agree, As each seem'd fond, and both prov'd false to me; But this Distinction Colleton's thy Due, The Fairest, Fondest, Falsest of the two: When Coquetry once taints a Woman's Mind, Nor Benefits oblige, nor Oaths can bind; Desire of Conquest is her only Aim, And Lust itself is but a second Flame:) Instructed by long Practice in the Sex, That all who 're form'd to please, are born to vex. At once I tore Love's Arrows from my Heart, And Time and Patience have allay'd the Smart, Not that now Frozen, who so lately Burn'd, To Hate, or low Revenge, my Thoughts are turn'd. When I recall to Mind each gentle Grace, That play'd round Colle's Neck and Waist and Face, To Hate's Unnat'ral, to Revenge were Base: That glowing Bosom, those bewitching Eyes, Will plead Excuse for all her Perjuries. With soft Complaisency I still survey, A tender Virgin blooming in her May; Melt at the Fires of Female Charms and Youth, But scarce in Haste shall doat upon their Truth. Wisely they jilt us to inhance the Joy, For tedious Constancy they think might cloy: To stronger Nerves the Tryal I resign, And hang my Arms up, now, at Venus' Shrine. The Muse hereafter too shall bend her Cares, To cure my Vanities, not flatter Theirs. From the worst Prospect on this Northern Shore. (Which others as a Banishment deplore) I turn my View, my Conduct to explore: Retir'd, reflect with Profit, and at Ease, On what has hurt, and what might well displease. Where frailer Nature had more frequent fail'd, And where ill Custom had by Stealth prevail'd; The rash Resolve, and the too prompt Reply, The hasty Faults that pass'd unheeded by, In Wine's hot Rage, or Lust's opprobrious Flame, And each Occasion of Offence, or Blame, To conscious Reason's strict Tribunal brought; Receive the Sentence of severer Thought. Not that to different Extremes I run; Constraint alike, and Licence I would shun; In virtuous Freedom I possess my Soul, And guide my Passions rather than controul. Thus, Far remov'd from Objects of Desire; Or the warm Joys that Friendship does inspire; Serene and calm, from Innocence I find, Perpetual Sun-shine in my chearful Mind. The World in ev'ry Scene, my Lord, supplies, Something to make one Happier, or more Wise, If Observation, but the Hint improve, And Head-strong Will, does not at Random rove. 'Tis Self-sufficiency is still our Bane; We work our Mis'ry, with our busy Brain. Could we on Providence repose our Cares, Less Numbers would complain of their Affairs; And what we often Checks of Fortune call, Are kind Restraints that save us from a Fall. On the cool Banks of Dee, as late I stray'd, By a long Train of rambling Thoughts convey'd, A sudden Incident surpriz'd my Sight, And interrupted my dear dull Delight, Else o'er the Brink the musing Fool had run, And the next fatal Step had been undone. Intent thus on a Mistress, or a Wife, Or any serious Trifle of our Life, Let Humour, or let Prudence be our Guide, Cautious, or Wild, alike our Feet may slide; For all our Plans, at best, are Waking-Dreams, And Chance oft, luckily, o'erturns our Schemes. SACRED to the MEMORY OF Lady Elizabeth Mansel. Lady Elizabeth Hervey, Eldest Daughter of John Earl of Bristol, Married Bussy Mansel, Youngest Son of Thomas Lord Mansel 1724, and Died 1727. Reader attend, and if thine Eye let fall A Tear, confess it Nature's Call. Consign'd to God, from whence the Blessing came, Here lye the precious Relicks of that Frame, Which, when inform'd with Life, attractive shin'd, With all we hope, or wish, in Women-kind. The diff'rent Attributes of Chast and Fair, (When join'd, how lovely! Yet alas, how rare!) With Charms united, did in Her combine; The Sex was Female, but the Soul Divine. Virtue, Discretion, and a Graceful Ease, (For sure in Her 'twas natural to please.) Adorn'd her Manners, in each Sphere of Life, The Daughter, Sister, Mistress, and the Wife. This Treasure lost, what Tongue can speak the Smart, Their noble Parents feel, and ev'ry kindred Heart; But chiefly His, whose faithful Bosom prov'd, The soft Endearments of his Sole-belov'd. Yet mourn not Youth, the Lot to either given, You live in Paradise, she dwells in Heaven. CLARA; OR VENUS AT ABERDEEN. A thousand Beauteous Forms I've seen, and lov'd; And Prudes, Coquets, or Jilts, they most have prov'd: But Clara Shines in all the Fire of Youth, Her each sweet Air speaks Tenderness and Truth: Her radiant Eyes eclipse Their brightest Charms; Her gentle Heart atones for all their Harms. Sept. 19. 1728. STANZAS, OCCASIONED By what happened at Aberdeen, October 15, 1728. I How odly is a Lover fated! When the dear Cause of all his Smart, By Two mad Rivals daily rated, Nor shuts against a Third her Heart. II My Foe's indulgently receiv'd, My Friend with Smiles invited, And I (God knows if I'm deceiv'd) Now favour'd, and now slighted. III Indiff'rence is a greater Curse To me than would have been your Scorn; 'Tis barbarous to starve at Nurse A Passion that was Hopefull Born. ENCORE. I How curs'd is his Fate, who at One time does prove, The Fetters of Wedlock, and Bondage of Love; Who chain'd to a Gally that's running a-drift, Meets no friendly Sail that will give him a Lift. II What fantastical Notions in Women we find 'Cause One is unjust, all the Rest are unkind. Their Honour, they tell you, prescribes these Reserves. For their Honour (Gadzooks) an honest Man Starves. III Methinks the Two Sexes might better agree; (I wish, faith for once, they'd be Counsell'd by me) Let all Parties aggriev'd, e'en make an Exchange, Then Husbands, and Wives, might have each their Revenge. TO CLARA. Aberdeen, October 26, 1728. When first I saw you (who says Love is blind?) Your bending Head was on your Arm reclin'd; A down-cast Look, but yet superior Grace Adorn'd with modest Airs your matchless Face; Your rising Breasts in gentle Heavings play'd, Like downy Cygnets on smooth Thames convey'd; The graceful Attitude attack'd my Sight, Inspiring Rev'rence mixt with soft Delight: Henceforth, said I, no more let Mem'ry vex My Soul with what I've suffer'd from the Sex; This faultless Maid may well absolve them all; And Venus! lo, thy Slave obeys thy Call. At Distance view'd if you could thus surprize, How warm the nearer Infl'ence of your Eyes! When Wit too, join'd with Beauty's potent Arms, Subdu'd my Heart with still increasing Charms. But Conqu'rors rarely merciful are seen; You rule a Tyrant, who might reign a Queen. Ah, kinder treat a Vassal-Love distrest; Be stil'd alike the Fairest and the Best: Reward my Homage with Returns of Grace, And make but good the Promise of your Face, Where each sweet Trait seems gently to conspire, At once to Raise and Favour my Desire. Votum Duplex. TO CLARA. On the Eleventh of October, 1728 Clara's Mother is the justly admired Mrs. Catherine Trotter, a very poetical and philosophical Lady: She has written five Plays. Agnes de Castro. Fatal Friendship. The unhappy Penitent. The Revolution of Sweden. (Tragedies) Love at a Loss: or, Most Votes carry it. A Comedy. Several Novels, Letters, &amp;c. and a pretty Piece in Defence of Mr. Locke's Essay, on Human Understanding. She was reclaimed from the Errors of the Church of Rome, in which she was educated, by the late Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, and recommended to the Rev. Mr. C. of Aberdeen, who married her.. Two wish'd Events did this Glad Day adorn, When George was Crown'd, and beauteous Clara Born: May Each in peaceful Triumphs happy prove, He blest in Loyalty, and You in Love. A Poetical Sally. Occasioned by some Peevish Censure on a late Merry-Meeting of Gentlemen and Ladies, at Aberdeen, October 23. 1728. And is then Life a lazy Length of Years, Train'd on in Cautions, and ignoble Fears, Where sportive Love must never dare intrude, And Mirth and Wit be damn'd as loud and lewd? Is it in slothful Sleep to spend the Night, Nor wake at sprightly Morn to gay Delight? Ne'er know the Joy, a Kindness to receive, And less, that sweeter Happiness to give? Drudge on to fifty in a rugged Road, Dully discreet, and impotently good; Till with Experience, Age comes limping on, With vile Distrust their sole-surviving Son, For the Twins, Hope and Joy, like still-born Babes were gone. Thus some pass thro' the World meer envious Spies, Nor feel one Object glad their Hearts, or Eyes. Wedded to Life, for Better and for Worse, My Genius led me, yet a smoother Course. Tho' young and vain upon the Stage I came, 'Twas not without some Sparks of Heav'nly Flame. That rais'd my Action in each op'ning Scene, And made me scorn ungen'rous Parts or Mean. Refin'd my Soul to elegant Desires, Friendship's warm Joys, or Love's Diviner Fires. Nor few, nor evil have been, thus my Days, While some have Pleasure gain'd, and others Praise: A Share to niggard Fate one must resign; Content for each New-Lease I paid the Fine. The Cares, and Toils, and Pains, the Price enhance; And there's a Bliss—that's worth Extravagance. The fainter Beams succeed the Youthful Blaze, Chearful I'll yet, bask in these milder Rays; And when the Little-Loves no more may please, The Graces still will charm me with their Ease, Soften the rigid Sentiments of Age, And give me Peace, as Pleasure gave me Rage: Then as my Play of Life grows almost done, I'll smile to see it copying by my Son. A SHORT REPLY TO A LONG SERMON Clara's Father is the Episcopal Pastor of Aberdeen; and was at this Time (in his Course of Preaching) reprehending the heinous Sins of Fornication and Adultery.. Aberdeen, October 25, 1728. From your harsh Morals, Learned Sir, refrain; Nor take the Name of Vanity in vain: Too well my Suff'rings your Reflections prove; Afflict not with Despair dejected Love: Few and false Joys, and frequent real Pain, Is what I know already, and complain. If then an useful Convert you would make, Preach to the Fair, and tell her for my Sake, That Life's Transitory Dream soon past; Bid her lay hold on each short Bliss in hast; For Conquest only, let her not employ Her pow'rful Charms but timely to enjoy: E'en her sweet Face, that lovely Red and White, Whose bare Idea fires me as I write; Shall feel each fading Feature soon decay, And sink at last to cold neglected Clay: Then add what Cowley has so well exprest, The Best itself, is but in Season Best. R. P. ADVICE TO A Young Gentleman Captain William A'court, Who was desired by the Lady I Loved, to Dance with her, at a Ball I was to Give, at Aberdeen, Nov. 4. 1728. Since to prevent a surly Parent's Frown, And the vile Malice of a tatling Town, I must (tho' Love and Prudence are at Strife) Resign a Partner—dearer than my Life; And leave the Prize in this invidious Ball To Thee, or to be scrambled for by All; 'Tis happy Billy, that in you I find A gentle Soul (the Partner of my Mind) Who knows the Secret of my fond Distress, Pity my Cares, and fain too would redress. To Thee the beauteous Charge I then Commend, Nice is the Trust—a Mistress to a Friend. Guard well thy Breast from ev'ry soft Surprize, And from too curious Search, thy wand'ring Eyes, For there are Charms in that bewitching Maid May foil the Wary, and the Firm invade: Small is the Force of Reason against Sense, If Honour steps-not-in to our Defense. And now, methinks, I hear the dire Alarms, Of sprightly Fiddles sounding loud to Arms; Each Gallant bows obsequious to the Fair, By Choice, or Chance, thus destin'd to his Care; Whilst I, in solemn Gravity advance, With my New Consort to commence the Dance Another Man might well this Fortune boast, Dance on till Midnight, and till Morning Toast; For sweetest Airs the pretty Creature Grace, Second alone to Matchless Clara's Face; But I, alas! a double Torment share, Concern'd not only for Myself but Her, Who while my Compliment I coldly make, Must quit a Youthful Bar'net Sir Arthur Forbes. for my Sake, And sure it would the wisest Lady spite, For a Plain Gentleman to lose a Knight. Well! He, and His, the Second Couple stand; And You the Third, with Clara in your Hand; Ah, let that Hand not Her's too closely Press, Reserve for me that Tender warm Excess, When (as Dan Cupid slily does design) Turning in Bury-Fair A Country Dance so called. our Hands shall join, Or when Young Roger Another Dance. urging on my Speed To Thee, Dear Damsel, I at length succeed. Thus jealous Fears shall not my Mirth controul, But, parting from the Darling of my Soul, In chearful Humour, and with active Grace I'll tread the Windings of the various Maze. When for Refreshment You a while repose, And Tête à Tête, the diff'rent Parties Close, The hardest Tryal then will prove thy Skill To check those strong Propensions of the Will, Which, while they make us Friendship's Rights betray, Persuade us we but Nature's Laws obey. From the pert Coxcomb safe, and him more dull, The odious Mixture of lewd Rake and Fool; Rivals of Vulgar Note I little fear, My Learned Maid would scorn such Sots to Hear; Good Nature, Wit, and Manners only move Desire in Women who are worthy Love: These steal insensibly upon the Mind; And the Head gain'd, the Heart won't lag behind. No fond Excuses, Youth, for Whispers seek, Trust not thy Lips too near her tempting Cheek; Yet if her list'ning Ear invite thy Tongue, Where soft Persuasion is so aptly hung, Make Use of that Occasion to inforce My Am'rous Passion by your kind Discourse; Instruct her how my constant Suff'rings prove The Gen'rous Ardour of sincerest Love; How well I taste her happy Talents show; And tell her all I feel, and all You know. Thus tho' she thinks you much resemble Him, Whose Int'rest in her, lessens her Esteem Of Me, that fav'rite Notion may succeed To make her Partial to me, while you Plead. Charm'd with so just a Conduct too, tho' strange, She'll ltarn from Your Example not to Change, And own, perhaps, the Man may well pretend To such a Mistress, who has such a Friend. R. P. THE Female Philosophers: This Tale was singly printed 1726. A TALE. Two Virgins in the Prime of Life, Who, each, had rather been a Wife; (Fanny and Jenny were their Names,) Like Sisters own'd their mutual Flames. And talking in a merry Mood, Of what is held Man's Chiefest-Good, One thought the Largest, one the Least, Would suit her Scene of Bliss the best, But un-inform'd by Hand or Eyes, Of the true Standard Manly-Size (Which must the Reader much surprize.) For Letch'ry and Experience Sake, A Tryal they resolv'd to make; That might give Fanny truer Scope, And some Ideas what to hope. Their Brother they had often heard, Tho' guiltless both of Wit and Beard, Was thought a Lad of lusty Parts, In what most takes with Ladies Hearts: Yet still they doubted at those Years If he was rightly in his Geers. His Sapling might in Time grow Timber, But now they fear'd it was too limber, And wish'd a Project to contrive To make Fifteen seem Twenty-five To raise, and round, young Simon's Figure, Big as his Daddy's,—nay, much bigger. An Instrument lay on the Table, (What's here related is no Fable;) With which their Sire was wont to pore, On Flies and Maggots by the Hour. For he was one of those shrewd Elves, Who study All-Things but Themselves So mighty Wise that he could spy The Motes in Luna's radiant Eye, Yet was so dull, He cou'd n't find Which Way his Daughters were inclin'd. The Girls more prudent would reduce Philosophy to Private Use; Their Scheme both Pleasant was and New, And thus the Waggs their Game pursue. Simon lay snoring fast asleep, When to his Bed they slily creep, And turning gently down the Sheet, Their Eyes a bold Priapus meet, Erect, and firm as honest Truth, In all the comly Force of Youth; Fanny directs the Optic-Frame In a Right-Line before that same; And each by Turns indulg'd her Sight With the gay Scene it brought to Light. The Tube plumps-up the nervous Feature, And adds Twelve Inches to its Stature, Happy, quoth Fanny, were the Bride, With such a Weapon by her Side, Now pr'ythee Jenny let me see, Th'Effect this Charm would have on Thee. Then instantly she shuts the Door, Extends the Wanton on the Floor, Naked the little Gipsy lies, Op'ning, and stretch'd, her taper Thighs. The nice Surveyor moves the Glass, In curious Search from Place to Place. First, view'd the Spacious Lawn of Love, Then All beneath The Mossy-Grove; At last, she fixt her piercing Sight Full on The Fountain of Delight. When lo! it yawn'd so hugeous wide, Bursting with Laughter, Fanny cry'd, To fill that Gap, and sooth thy Cares, Requires more ? than Thou hast Hairs. FINIS.</field>
