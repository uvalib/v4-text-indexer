      <field name="fulltext">Nec, si quid olim lusit— Delevit ætas. Hor. Ode 8. lib. 4. You laugh—'tis well. Cowper. DEDICATION. TO THAT Man, who is ever willing to be pleased, “he knows not why, and cares not wherefore.” THE ICEAD. Medio de fonte leporum Surgit amari aliquid. When Phœbus, verging on th'Antarctic line, Rolls his red flame from this our British clime Far distant; when Winter scours high Heaven, On ebon wing, and from his cavern'd cheek Blows many a blast of coldest puff; and when Stern Frost, upon whose shoulders stiffly strait The hair spreads froz'n in many an icicle, Sits open mouth'd, to bite of heedless men The fingers (for some more cunning mortals At fire of coals oft make his meat too hot For him to bite); when Nature's face low'rs dull With thick'ning cloud, and looks nasty, dismal, As the face of boy with nose unwiped; When all is sad;—not so the minds of men, For sport they meditate. On the bosom Of the lake, frequent they meet. There quick hies The truant, with sick frame too weak for school; And there the man who leaves no chearful home, Because no chearful home he has to leave; And there the buck, who knows not why he came; There he who follows Whitfield, he, who Wesley; The Swedenborgite there, and there the Jew. On scate of iron keel upborne they ride; Of iron dug from Sweden's entrails, or From those of Russia, or Toledo. With furious speed some hasten to outstrip The breath of Boreas; some, with wond'rous poise Self-balanc'd, in airy curve float easy On their way; nor knew the Gordian knot A fold so complex as their paths entwine. The scrap'd edge loudly sounds, but louder still The cry of those, who delicacies vend Of mutton-pies, and nuts, and cakes, and gin. But chief the call of gingerbread most hot Breaks the dense atmosphere, and foolish men (Tho' luxury, more powerful than the sword, Which strews th'ensanguin'd plain with many a corse, More powerful than the breath of Pestilence Sends millions yearly to the court of death) Check the swift scate, and eager catch the sound. 'Twas noon; and round a vender of this food A crowd was met; and happiness was there. Happy the man who now regal'd first serv'd! And happy he, who arm'd with halfpence stood Mix'd with no mass from Cyclopean forge Of Birmingham! The unpenc'd wight pass'd on. Here all was mirth. When, lo! sudden, and loud (Ne'er did the voice of Jove more dreadful sound), A crack was heard. None stopp'd to look aghast, But fled wide-circling. Whether the Naiads Mistook the cakes as offerings at their shrine, And hungry wish'd to snap them up, my Muse Sings not; but quick into the lake they fell, Slice coursing slice; while he, poor man of spice! While he, his head scarce lifted o'er the flood, With tears, quick freezing as they fell, counted Each half-p'worth: and now, struggling to emerge, For aid he calls; but what can now avail His eloquence? All stand aloof. 'Tis not The cry of gingerbread. IMITATION OF HORACE. My honest and my good friend Will, Who know'st my Muse has worn her quill With verses bad, for which that rudis, Whose name unclassically crude is, Has often crossed my back at school, Why wish me now to play the fool? Mendoza after many a heating Fears, least the last should prove a beating: Besides, a veteran friend has chid me, And whispering in my ear has bid me, “Beware of Pegasus: if you please, “Mount:—but you're sure to break his knees.” Rhymes, verses then, and all such things I leave to drolls, and Present Emperor is a great Poet. Vide Peter Pindar. Chinese Kings. All that is serious and good Is now my literary food: And stores I'm hoarding every day, In case they're drawn upon in The annual examination of the Coll. then takes place. May. Perhaps you'll ask “quo duce utor”? And who's my Mathematic Tutor? Agnipedes. At 10 o'clock My knuckles at his out-door knock. Still my attendance is not such But that at Politics I touch; And thrice a week Lloyd's Evening Post Conveys me news from t'other coast, Of what the Sans-culottes are doing In all the happiness of ruin. And now and then I take a trip As Horace wont to Aristip, (Thy follower, O Epicure) To ?? near Petty Curie. But as to lover sad bewailing, While up and down the street he's trailing; And all most piteously complaining, While it most piteously is raining, The night seems long; so each hour drags on, While the poor Freshman funks and fags on, Till that dread day, when every sizar, With golden gowns for honours tries, Sir. For this day, (as there's no refusing,) The Elements I'm hard perusing. What, tho' this road I ever travel, And never should o'ertake a T?! Yet now and then by way of vomit, I take a little Trigonomet- ry, and bring my heated brain To plane and level thoughts again. Of angles, secants, tangents, sines Such various powers of various lines In magic Ludlam may be had, As make mad sound, and sound men mad. Into this Part of the Examination is in Ludlam. Astrologic book Magicians very soon shall look: Each ass then, when his fate appears, Shall hear his doom and drop his ears. A Proverb, not less true than old, Says, “small-change ever yields to gold;” “Merit to both.” Whoe'er you meet From Trompington to Andrew's Street Will cry, I grant the man has ????: But, pray, who values this a louse? He's plenty too of Greek and Latin: What then?—His breeches are not sattin. He's mighty good, and mighty steady: Granted, my friend; but where's his Ready? His merit's great.—I'm sure you lie, Sir, I tell you he is but a Sizar. Let him, who'd have his merits known, With golden trappings deck his gown! Then every one shall view his lace, And see he's clever by—his face. The little boys at school will say “The cleverest shall rule the play;” “T'have robbed no orchard, done no evil,” “Like brazen wall, will keep the devil” “From ent'ring in.”—Come, come to College, Ye silly boys, and mend your knowledge! Tis common talk to say that you, My friend, should act as others do, Who live within the self-same wall, And eat within the self-same hall. To such I answer, “Cast you eye on “The Fable of the Fox and Lion. “Full many of our bucks so stout “Break into jail, but none break out.” This will o'wisp of night and day Who'd follow to be led astray? Fashion; whose various change of names The hydra-headed phasm proclaims. Now She's the tip, the stare, the gaze, And now the thing, the flame, the blaze. Now She's the whip, and takes a jig With Billy Whip-cord in a gig: And now again She's all the flog, And sports a nag to Gog-magog: And now She's grown the very kick, And down stairs helps to throw a Tick. Now with some spark She'll take a cutter, And sail down Cam's smooth-flowing gutter, And there full gallantly glide on, Till landed safe at Chesterton: Where sporting billiards, bowls and tea, Cries Fashion, “Who so great as We?” Another up to Town she takes, And there right joyously he rakes; In ruin's high road posts smack dash on; Because—Gadzooks! it is the Fashion. See one who sports a good warm house, And eke a comfortable spouse, Says, Life has nothing that could please him,— A fellowship perhaps might ease him.— The Fellow, swears upon his life He'll wed—a fashionable wife. Laugh on, my friend; both poor and rich Have got the fashionable itch. We Sizars sport our nag and boat, Our every day and sunday coat, Give sizings of delicious gammon Of bacon or of pickled salmon; And sit in magisterial state To quaff our morning chocolate, Tasting, like Lillyputian kings, The luxury of little things. If half en queue and half a crop Into your presence I should pop, If half the rags of half my gown Their brother raglings should disown, You'd smile:—then lustily you'd laugh To see me every thing by half; Half gambling, jockying, raking, drinking, And halving every thing but—thinking. The Student, who has made the greatest proficiency in Mathematical knowledge.Senior of Wranglers! day and night Beam forth in thy auspicious light! Thou Son of Cambridge, Good and Fair! (All else I value not a hair) Thou'rt all majestic to a tittle With nothing mortal, but thy—spittle! EPIGRAMS, &amp;c. On a Preacher who was very fond of exhibiting his white hand in the pulpit. Earth shook, Heaven trembled at the Lord's command, Our Preacher said, and—waved his lily hand. On seeing the initials of a notorious lawyer's name cut deep into his tombstone. Initials just! for well you shew, How deep he was Who lies below. On hearing that the French had melted down their images to purchase artillery. Says a Rev. Priest to his less Rev. friend, Where at length will the crimes of these French villains end, Who their Saints and their Martyrs thus impiously sell, And convert into damnable engines of Hell? Prithee why, quoth his friend, are you so much surprized, That Saints had their desert and were all—canonized. EXTEMPORE On a Gentleman more famous for the multiplicity of cloaths in which he always appeared dressed, than for his abilities. Some place their wardrobe on a wooden shelf; But wooden W? on his wooden self. On hearing a Gentleman who squinted, assert that the prophecies were to be understood in a double sense. A double sense no wonder ?? spies; The fault's not in his brain but in his eyes. On hearing that a certain Gentleman hid himself in a hollow tree in order to discover and apprehend the amorous parties of the neighbourhood. Fair damsel, who may through the wood Like Daphne chance to be pursued, Be sure ne'er turn into a tree; For there your follower you'll see. On a Gentleman who was remarkable for bowing his head down in a musing posture, whenever his comprehension failed him. Antæus sinking to the earth Supply of strength obtains; So Marcus downward bends his head In hopes to find his brains. IMPROMPTU To Miss S? on seeing her neck adorned with a golden chain. In mercy sure you wear that chain Informing each admiring swain, That if he dares to look above, Bound he'll be in chains of Love. FOR A CATCH. A roaring Jack Was Hynes O'Hack, As e'er a one in seven; For when Death stopped his throttle, And took away his bottle, He scraped his skull, And fill'd it full To drink on his road to Heaven. Amoto quæramus seria ludo. EMMA TO EDWARD. How long will you Edward delay To restore to your Emma her peace? For alas! as each hour glides away Her disgrace and her sorrows increase! Oh! haste, or a pledge of our love Will the shame of it's parent declare; Ah! soon the sad tale will it prove; Ah! soon in my misery share. Your passion could brook no delay, Till your poor Emma's heart you had won; You esteemed every moment a day, Till you saw your poor Emma undone. Oh! haste to dispel the sad fear, Which you gave my bosom to know! Be as speedy to wipe off the tear As you once were to cause it to flow! TO SOPHIA. 'Twas not thy sparkling eyes, That float in liquid love; Nor yet thy form that vies With Venus. her's, who won the prize, That did my passion move: Nor wealth;—for from thy lowly shed On her golden pinions To her fav'rite minions Fortune far away has fled. But when with piteous sighs Was told a tale of woe, I marked thy tearful eyes, I saw thy bosom rise To ease the labouring throe. Nor I can boast or wealth or power; But in my tender breast Does gentle Pity rest: —Then mutual is the dower. On seeing Mrs. Siddons the first time, and then in the Character of Isabella. Pity! my breast ne'er knew thee for it's own, Nor Sympathy, dear parent of the sigh! Tho' oft the tear fell trickling from my eye, A moment vanished,—and the scene was gone: A cold Promethean form!—Till Siddons' spell Waked every feeling from it's icy cell. The Vide Isabella. “The Mourner comes.” Mourner came—and Pity was my own. O! I did hear each accent of her woe; Grief rushed on grief, till all my senses flown Forgot to ease the torrent in a throe; My soul had fled it's nook, and in my eye Suspended hung in tearful extasy. SONNET To a Gentleman, who presented the Author with a Violin. O! Harmony, sweet minstrel of the spheres, Who know'st to raise the rapturous glow, Or wake the tenderest tear of woe, Come, dear companion of my future years!
