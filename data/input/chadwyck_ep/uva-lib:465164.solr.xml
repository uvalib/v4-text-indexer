      <field name="fulltext">[Tome the first] EPITHALAMIUM. On the Royal Nuptials, in May 1736. I On Thamis' Banks, where many a flow'ry Gem Blooms wanton-wild, advanc'd a jovial Crew, Thick as the Daisies which his Meadows hem; And with sweet Herbs the liquid Crystal strew; For on the liquid Crystal gayly flew A painted A Boat. Gondelay, bedecked fair With Gold and Purple, gorgeous to the View! While loud approving Shouts divide the Air, “Hail, happy future Bride of Albion's worthy Heir.” II Presently.Eftsoons the Father of the silver Flood, The noble Thames, his azure Head uprais'd, And shook his dewy Locks, worthy a God! A lambent Glory round his Temples blaz'd, On which the Naïds all with wonder gaz'd. So sparkle Thetis purple-trembling Streams, When Phœbus, for his golden Car yprais'd, Strikes the calm Surface with his Morning Beams, And sprinkles Spangles round and the wide Blue inflames. III The wanton Naïds, Doris' Daughters all, Range in a Ring: Pherusa, blooming-fair, Cymodoce Dove-ey'd, with Florimal, Sweet-smelling Flowrets deck'd their long green Hair, And Erato, to Love, to Venus dear, Galene drest in smiles and Lilly-white, And Phao, with her snowy Bosom bare, All these, and more than these, a dainty Sight! In Daunce and Merriment and sweet Beautiful Looks. Belgards Delight. IV Around the Bark They daunce, wherein there sat A Lady fresh and fair, ah! such a One, So fresh and fair, so amiably great, So goodly-gracious seem'd as never none, And like thy sweet-beam'd Planet, Venus, shone. They much admire, O very much her Face, Her Shape, her Breast, for Love a downy Throne! Her Beauty's glorious Shine, her every Grace; An Angel She appear'd, at least of Angel-Race. V Her Thamis (on his golden Urn he lean'd) Saluted with this Hymeneal Song, And hail'd her safe. Full silent was the Wind, The River glided gently-soft along, Nor.Ne whispered the Breeze the Leaves emong, Ne love-learn'd Philomel out-trill'd her Lay; A Stillness on the Waves attentive hung, A brighter Gladness blest the Face of Day, All Nature gan to smile, her Smiles diffus'd the May. VI “Ah sacred Ship, to Albion wafting Good, Our Wish, our Hope, our Joy! who safe convey'd Through perilous Sea, from Ila's little Flood, This Beauty's Paragon, this Royal Maid, Isprung, Iwist, of high empyreal Seed; The Child of Heaven, the Daughter of Delight, Nurst by a Grace, with Milk and Honey fed! Oh Frederick! oh, Certainly. certes, blessed Wight, To Whom the Gods consign the Nymph Augusta Named. hight. VII Ah sacred Ship! may favourable Gales, The kindest Breath of Heav'n attend thy Way, And swell the winged Canvass of thy Sails: May Calmness be thy Path, and Pleasaunce lay On the soft Bosom of the yielding Sea, Where-e're thou Wind; or to the spicy Shore Of Araby the blest, or Indias Bay, Where Diamonds kindle, and the golden Ore Flames into Purity, to deck Augusta more! VIII Augusta, fairest Princess under Sky, Welcome to Albion's renowned Land, Albion well known to thy great Ancestry, Made dearer far to Thee by Hymen's Band, The Band of Love, of Honour and Command! Deign to receive the Nations publick Voice, Of Heartiness unfeign'd, who gleeful stand In meet Array, and thus express their Joys In Peals of loud Acclaim, and Mirths confused Noise. IX With warmer Raptures, and more passionate, Tho' hard to be! the Royal Youth, I trow, Shall Thee embrace: Him tenfold Fires elate, And sacred Passions in his Bosom glow, Which from thy Picture erst began to flow. For Thee He burns, for Thee He sighs and prays, Pours out his Soul to Thee, nor Rest can know; But dreams of Thee long, livelong Nights and Days, By Beauty led thro' all Love's Rosy-Thorny-Ways. X To heal his Pains soft Musick does divide Most heavenly Melody in soothing Strains; Nor heavenly Melody, nor aught beside, Save Thee, ah Dearest Dread! can heal his Pains. Thy Form too deeply in his Breast Remains. So ever and anon He chides the Gales, That slowly seem to brush the liquid Plains; Oh! fly on all the Wings of Heav'n, ye Sails, Oh fly! He crys; and lo! a Lover's Pray'r prevails. XI Now cease thy Sighs. She comes, (oh blessed Day!) She comes, by all the Loves and Graces drest, In proud Humility. See, Hymen play, With Saffron Robe and Flame-embroider'd Vest, (Such Colours, Surely. sikerly, suit Hymen best.) And Cupid Catches rosy wafts of Air To stretch the Sails and fan the Royal Guest. Nor Chastity, meek-ey'd, is wanting there, For She, and Modesty, sweet-blushing, guide the Steer. XII Not Venus, Queen of Beauty and of Bliss So goodly shone, when Formerly. erst the Goddess sprung From Ocean's sparkling Foam; sweet Nakedness! A thousand Smiles and Loves upon her hung, And all the Gods for Joy and wonder sung. The Waves so proud the beamy Burthen bore Exulting; She, around her, Odours flung, And bade the Billows laugh and cease to roar; They gladly Her obey, and gently kiss the Shore. XIII So fair She looks, nay fairer, cou'd it be; Did never mortal Man such Charms behold In Bow'r or Hall. Spring waits upon her Eye; Lo! Flora has her richest Stores out-roll'd Of variable Flow'rs and blooming Gold. The Meadows smile, the Birds renew their Love And throw Themselves in Pairs the Young and Old; All Nature glows where're her Glances move, And Beauty paints each Field, and Musick fills each Grove. XIV But Who is yon, each other Youth excelling As much as orient Gold surmounteth Brass? Sure Honour in his Visage chose her Dwelling, And sacred Truth, An Affirmation. Perdie, adorns his Face; Such Goodlihead and Humbless never was. Blest be the Sight! full well those looks I kenn, Where Joyaunce sits and ever-smiling Grace; Frederick! 'tis He! the first and best of Men, Our dearling Prince to meet Augusta Handsom. well-beseen. XV And lo! what medled Passions in Him move, He gazes—wonders—(great is Beauty's Pow'r!) And, sweetly lost in Ecstasy and Love, His Eyes her Whole, his Lips her Lips devour, Which Venus had besprent with Nectar-Show'r. Her slippery Charms allow his Eyes no Rest, But thousand Arrows, nay ten thousand pour Into his wounded and transported Breast; Sure none like her is fair, sure none like him is blest! XVI O blessed Youth! receive thy Beautiful Virgin. Bonnibel, Eternal Fount of Virtue, Love and Grace! O kneel to all the Gods and pray to all, Who sparkle so divinely in her Face, And with celestial Fires her Bosom bless. So shines Aurora in her rich Attire, When She Hyperion wou'd fain caress: Gaze all the Host of Stars, and all admire, Then twinkle in their Urns, and into Night retire. XVII O blessed Maid! receive thy Charming Lover. Belamour, With glee receive Him and o'erflowing Heart: Ne in high Monarch's Court, ne Lady's Bow'r, A Youth so form'd by Nature and by Art, Conspiring Both, e're cherish'd Cupid's Dart. So Phœbus, lusty Bridegroom of the Sky, With native Splendours shines on every Part; From East to West his pointed Glories fly, He warmeth every Heart, He dazleth every Eye.” XVIII Here Thamis ended. Now the goodly Train Of all the Naïds, in most comely wise, A Present make of Myrtle-Girland green, Entrail'd with Flowrets and with rare device. The Graces eke, with Laughter-swelling Eyes, A Rosy-Chaplet, steep'd in Nectar bring, (The Roses gather'd in the Morning Skies) Then, joining with the Naïds, form a Ring, And round Them deftly daunce, and round Them blithly sing. XIX “As Roses and as Myrtles kindly weave Their Sweets in One, much sweeter as they blend; Emblem of Marriage-Love! So You, receive Sweets interchang'd, and to each other lend; Then, in a blest Perfume, to Heav'n ascend, And mingle with the Gods! While Here below, New Myrtles, Roses new, withouten end, From your luxurious Stock, full plenteous, grow, And with their Parent-Sweets, and Parent-Beauty glow.” XX Next Albion's Genius came, bedite in Gold, An Oaken Chaplet nodded on his Head; The Crown He held was glorious to behold, And royally He taught his Feet to tread. Soon as he spy'd the Prince's Goodlyhead, He pointed to the Crown, and rais'd his Voice To hail the Royal Pair and bless their Bed: The jolly Chorus catch the grateful Noise, Echo the Woods and Vales, and Heav'n and Earth rejoice. XXI Next Liberty, the fairest Nymph on Ground; The flowing Plenty of her golden Hair Diffusing lavishly Ambrosia round; Her Hands a flow'ry Cornucopia bear, Which scatter's Joy and Pleasaunce through the Air. Earth smil'd, and Gladness danc'd along the Sky; Before Her vanish'd Grief and pale-ey'd Care, And Often eft, in courteous Guise, she cast her Eye On that same gentle Twain, her Glory and her Joy. XXII And These beside, a Sacred Per'snage came, Immaculate and sweet as Sharon-Rose: Upon her Breast a Bloody Cross did flame, Aumail'd with Gold and Gems in goodly Rows: A Pall of Lawn adown her Shoulders flows: Called.Yclep'd Eusebia. She pray'd aloud, Then, blessing Both, for her Defenders chose, And spheard her Glories in a purple Cloud: Softly Augusta smil'd, full lowly Frederick bow'd. XXIII Fair Fame behind a silver Trumpet blew, Sweet to the Earth, and fragrant to the Sky! Her Mantle of a many-colour'd Hue, Her Rain-bow-Wings pouder'd with many an Eye, And near her Honour, Pow'r, and Courtesy: Honour of open Front, and steady Grace; Pow'r, clad in Steel, a Faulchion brandish'd high; Courtesy drest in Smiles her bounteous Face: When These attend a Prince, thrice happy Subject's Case! XXIV The Muses clos'd this intellectual Scene From Helicon; who knows not Helicon? Gold were their Lyres, their Laurels ever-green. Soon Clio to the Prince a starry Crown Presents, another to his Fair Damsel. Bellibone. Then all in lofty Chorus swell the Song, Big with their happy Loves and great Renown. Prophetick Numbers float the Woods emong, For Shepherd-Lad too high, for Memory too long. XXV Nevertheless.Nathless thy tuneful Sons, O Oxford dear! By Muses visited, may catch the Lays, Sweet-pouring Streams of Nectar on the Ear, And from Their Lips, in Vision, learn to raise Their Loves and Fame, to brighten future Days. Thee fits not, Thomalin, a simple Swain, High Deeds to sing, but gentle Roundelays: Go feed thy Flock, renew the rural Strain On oaten Pipe, content to please the humble Plain. BEAUTY and MUSICK. An Ode. Air I. O softly Sigh into the Flute, While dear Ianthe breaths the lovesick Lay: Now teach the melancholy Lute In tender trills to melt the Notes away, Melodious in Decay!— But hark, She louder, louder sings, Sink, boldly sink into the Strings: Shake, O shake the numerous Wire, Fire the Blood, the Spirits fire With musical Thunder and burning Desire! Air II. Our Souls divided with a fond Surprise Dissolve in Woe; With Rapture glow; Fall with her Notes; or with her Bosom rise; Rais'd with Hopes; with Fears deprest; Sweetly tortur'd, sweetly blest; Sav'd by Her Voice, and Vanquish'd by her Eyes. Recitative. The God of Love, to hear her Strains Leaves his Acidalian Plains, And, as th' harmonious Charmer sings, In triumph points his Darts and waves his Wings. Th' harmonious Charmer paus'd to see A list'ning, wond'ring Deity; While Silence softly chain'd her Tongue, The God responsive rais'd the Song, In Strains like these, if Strains can be Rais'd to the Raptures of a Deity, The Raptures of a wond'ring Deity! Air III. Beauty, sacred Beauty sing, Flowing from the wond'rous Spring Of uncreated and primeval Light! Beauty the first-best Work of God, Spoke into Being in his high Abode, And next his own Eternal Essence bright! Air IV. With Beauty Musick join, The Breath of Heav'n To Mortals given To swell their Bliss to Bliss divine! With Beauty Musick join. Chorus. Beauty, silent Harmony! Softly stealing through the Eye Smiles into the the Breast a Dart. Musick, fine-proportion'd sounds! Pours Balm upon the Lover's Wounds Through the Ear into the Heart. Recitative. Thus once Cecilia, (tuneful Dryden sings.) To fire with sacred Rage her Soul, Touch'd into Voice the sprightly Strings, And bade the silver Tides of Musick roll. An Angel, list'ning to her Lyre, To lift the Modulations higher, Apply'd the aiding Graces of his Tongue; And while the Virgin play'd, the Seraph sung. Air V. Sweetest Mortal, to befriend Thee, Angels from their Quires attend Thee, Angels leave their Thrones to hear Musick with Devotion glowing, Musick heavenly Joys bestowing, Worthy a Seraphick Ear! Recitative. Again she trembles o'er the silver Strings, The silver Strings, exulting to her Hand, Obey the sweet Command, And thus again the Angel sings. (While Silence wav'd her downy Wings around, And Gladness smil'd along the purple Skies; All Nature soft'ned at their Flows of Sound, And bright'ned at the Radiance of their Eyes.) Air VI. Harmony, the Soul refining! Beauty, Sense, and Virtue joining In a Form and Mind like Thine, Nobly raise a mortal Creature To a more exalted Nature; We alone are more Divine! Recitative. Rapt'rous thus the Angel sung, Manna melting from his Tongue, Attemper'd to Cecilia's golden Lyre: The blended Powr's of Harmony Trembled up the willing Sky, And mingled with the Seraph's flaming Quire. Chorus. How sweet the Musick, how divine, When Heaven and Earth in Consort join! O sweet the Musick! O divine! Air. VII. Skill'd the softest Notes to sing, Skill'd to wake the sweetest String, Dear Ianthe Both supplies: Thee, Cecilia, Thee we find In Her Form and in her Mind, The Angel in her Voice and Eyes! Chorus. Happy, O beyond expressing! He who tastes th' immortal Blessing Dear Ianthe may bestow! Beauty, in its pride, possessing, Ever loving and caressing, Musick moving, Bliss improving!— He'll enjoy a Heav'n-Below! Happy He, beyond expressing! THE DESPAIRING MAIDEN. I Within an unfrequented Grove As late I laid alone, A tender Maid in deep Distress, At Distance, made her Moan. II She cropt the blue-ey'd Violet, Bedew'd with many a Tear; And ever and anon her Sighs Stole sadly on my Ear. III “Ah faithless Man! how cou'd he leave So fond and true a Maid? Can so much Innocence and Truth Deserve to be betray'd? IV Alass, my Mother (if the Dead Can hear their Children groan.) What ills your helpless Orphan feels, To Sorrow left alone! V To Sorrow left by Him I lov'd; Ah perjur'd and ingrate!— Ye Virgins, learn the Wiles of Men, And learn to shun my Fate. VI For whom do I these Flourets crop, For whom this Chaplet twine? Say, shall they glow on Damon's Brow, Or fade away on mine? VII But He the blooming Wreath will scorn, Who scorn'd my Virgin-bloom: And me—alass! they suit not me, Unless to deck my Tomb. VIII How oft the dear perfidious Youth Invok'd each Pow'r above! How oft He languish'd at my Feet, And vow'd eternal Love! IX How sweet the Minutes danc'd away, All melted in Delight! With Him each Summer-Day was short, And short each Winter-Night. X 'Twas more than Bliss I felt:—and now Alass! 'tis more than pain.— Ye soft, ye rosy Hours of Love, Return—return again. XI Ah no.—Let Blackness shade the Night, When first He breath'd his Vows: The Scene of Pleasure then—but, ah! The Source of all my Woes. XII How cou'd I think so sweet a Tongue Cou'd e'er consent to lye?— 'Twas easy to deceive a Maid So soft and young as I. XIII And yet He lays the Fault on me, (Where none cou'd e're be laid, Unless my loving Him too well.) And calls me perjur'd Maid. XIV The Nymphs, who envious saw my Charms, Rejoice to see my Woe, And taunting cry, “why did you leave The Youth that lov'd you so?” XV But oh believe me, lovely Youth, Far dearer than my Eye, I love you still, and still will love, Till oh, for you, I dye! XVI Ev'n tho' you hate, I doat to Death; My Death my Truth shall prove. My latest Pray'rs are Pray'rs for You, And Sighs are Sighs of Love.” XVII She ceas'd:—(while Pity from the Clouds Dissolv'd in silent Show'rs:—) Then faintly “Damon!” cry'd:—and breath'd Her Soul amid the Flow'rs. THE DESPAIRING LOVER. I When gloomy November, to Nature unkind, Both saddens the Skies, and oppresses the Mind, By Beauty undone, a disconsolate Swain Thus sigh'd his Despair to the Winds and the Rain. II “In vain the Wind blows, and in vain the Rains beat, They fan but my Flame, without quenching the Heat; For so fierce is the Passion which Stella inspires, Not the Ocean itself cou'd extinguish its fires. III Why gaz'd ye, My Eyes, with such aking Delight, Till Paradise open'd and swam in my Sight: Yes, Paradise open'd, and oh! to my Cost, The Serpent I found, but the Paradise lost. IV Heav'n knows with what Fondness her Heart I Addrest, What passionate Tenderness bled in my Breast: Yet so far was my Truth from engaging Belief, That She frown'd at my Vows, tho' She smil'd at my Grief. V Sure never was Love so ill-fated as mine; If a Friend shall demand Her, what, must I resign?— Yes, yes, O resign Her, be bravely distrest; And tho' I die unhappy, yet—may He be blest! VI And how blest must He be?—O to live on her Charms! At her Wit while He wonders to sink in her Arms!— But yet, O my Soul, to his Friendship be just: Let Him live on her Charms;—I'll go down to the Dust. VII To the Chambers of Darkness I gladly will go, For the Light without Her is the Colour of Woe: Come, Death, then relieve me, my Life I resign, Since the Arrows of Love are less friendly than Thine. VIII Ye Virgins of Isis, the Fair and the Young, Whose Praises so often have sweet'ned my Tongue, In Pity, when of my sad Fate you shall hear, Oh, honour my Grave with a Rose and a Tear! IX Perhaps the dear, beautiful Cause of my Doom May steal, by the Star-light, and visit my Tomb: My Ghost, if one Sigh shall but heave in her Breast, Tho' restless without it, contented will rest. TO THE AUTHOR of LEONIDAS: A Poem. An Epistle. Warm'd with thy Verse, which Liberty inspires, Which Nature forms and sacred Reason fires, I pour a tributary Lay. Receive The honest Praise a Friend may dare to give. Most of our Poets chuse their early Theme A flow'ry Meadow, or a purling Stream. Thy Genius took a flight above the Groves, The Pipe neglected and the Rural Loves; To God-like Newton's Praises swell'd thy Lyre, Play'd with the Light and grasp'd æthereal Fire. So the Young Lyrick-Lark, on trembling Wings O'er Meadows warbles, and to Shepherds sings, The youthful Eagle, born to nobler Sway, Enjoys the Sun, and boldly faces Day. Next brave Leonidas, with Virtue warm'd, The Child of Heav'n and Thee! our Wonder charm'd: Our Wonder and our Silence best can tell How much He lov'd his Greece, how great He fell. His Arm how dreadful, how compos'd his Mien! Fierce as a God, and as a God serene. Horrid with Gold, and formidably bright He lightens and He thunders through the Fight; With bleeding Hills He heaps the groaning Plain, And crimson Torrents mingle with the Main. At last, collecting all his Patriot-Fires, In the full Blaze of Liberty expires. If blest Immortals bend their Thoughts below, (And Verse like thine may list'ning Angels draw.) What new-felt Raptures through the Hero roul, To find his Deeds immortal as his Soul! To shine above each Patriot's honour'd Name, Thron'd in Thy Verse, the Temple of his Fame! Rich as the Pillars which support the Skies, And bright with Wit as Heav'n with Starry Dies: As Virtue, firm; as Liberty, sublime; A Monument to mock the Rage of Time. Did Homer, say, thy glowing Breast inspire To sing the Spartan with Athenian Fire? Or Homer's Self revives again in Thee: For Grecian Chiefs and Grecian Wit I see.— His mighty Spirit all thy Genius guides, And o'er thy Bosom roll his golden Tides. Blest is thy Fancy which durst first despise Gods in Machines and Bullies from the Skies. Nor Ariosto's Fables fill thy Page Nor Tasso's Points, but Virgil's sober Rage. Pure-temper'd Fires an equal Light maintain, To warm the Reason, not to scorch the Brain. How soft, how strong thy varied Numbers move, Or swell'd to Glory, or dissolv'd to Love. Correct with Ease, where all the Graces meet, Nervously plain, majestically sweet. The Muses well thy Sacrifice repay Attendant warbling in each heavenly Lay! When Ariana grasps th' abhorred Dart, Each Lover bleeds and feels it in his Heart. Ah faithful Pair! by Misery improv'd: Who wou'd not die to love as you have lov'd? Like Teribazus gladly I cou'd die To draw one tear from dear Ianthe's Eye. One Sigh of Hers wou'd recompence my Breath, Wou'd sweeten Pain, and sanctify my Death. O might I, while her Eyes inflict the Wound, Or her soft Lute dissolves a plaintive Sound, Might I, while She inhales my latest Breath, Sink from her Arms into the Arms of Death! Then rise, (so pure a Wish may be forgiven.) O sweet Transition, from her Breast to Heav'n! Forgive this fond Excursion of my Woe; Forgive these Tears, that will, rebellious, flow; Forgive these Sighs, that will, unbidden, rise, Till Death for ever close her from my Eyes. But thou, blest Youth, may thou for ever know The chaste Endearment, and parental Glow: The still, the sacred, the melodious Hour, The Morning-Closet, and the Ev'ning-Bow'r. There, when thy Muse shall let her Eagle fly, And nobly lift a Mortal to the Sky, When all th' inspiring God dilates thy Soul, And quick Ideas kindle as they roll, Let British Valour thy brave Care engage, With British Valour fire the glorious Page. Bid Henry's Honours in thy Poem glow, On Edward Immortality bestow. Let Agin-Court, let Cressy's well-fought Plain Run purple in thy Lines and bleed again; Britannia then, no more Her Sons shall mourn, Extinct, forgotten in the silent Urn: Born on the Wings of Verse their Names shall rise, Dear to the Earth and grateful to the Skies. Hail, Poetry! whose Life-infusing Lays Bid Time roll back aud sleeping Atoms raise; Dust into Being wake, expand the Tomb, Dead Glory quicken, and restore lost Bloom: As God, from Mortals heighten to Divine, And give Us through Eternity to shine! Glover! thy Mind, in various Virtue wise, Each Science claims, and makes each Art thy Prize. With Newton soars, familiar to the Sky, Looks Nature through, so keen thy mental Eye, Or down descending on the Globe below, Through humbler Realms of Knowledge loves to flow. Promiscuous Beauties dignify thy Breast, By Nature happy, as by Study blest, Thou, Wit's Columbus! from the Epick-Throne New Worlds descry'd, and made Them all our own: Thou first through real Nature dar'd explore, And waft her sacred Treasures to our Shore. The Merchant thus, by Heav'nly Wisdom led, (Each Kingdom noted, and Each Law survey'd.) On Britain pours whate're can serve Mankind, Adorn the Body, or delight the Mind. Spices which blow'd in Araby the blest, And breath'd a Paradise around the East. Unclouded Sapphires show their azure Sky, Em'ralds with smiling Green refresh the Eye: Here bleeds the Ruby, Diamonds sparkle there, To tremble on the Bosoms of our Fair. Yet shou'd the Sun with ten-fold Lustre shine, Exalt with deeper Dies the flaming Mine, Shou'd softer Breezes and more genial Skies Bid sweeter Spice, in blooming Order, rise, Nor Gems, nor Spice cou'd Nature know to name, Bright as thy Wit, or fragrant as thy Fame. WINTER; A Translation of ODE BRUMALIS. By the Reverend Mr. Tattersal, late Fellow of Trinity Coll. Cambridge. Alas! no longer now appear The softer Seasons of the Year. Of Sports and Loves what Muse now sings? Away, my Lyre;—Boy, break the Strings. Old joyless Winter, who disdains Your sprightly, flow'ry, Attic Strains, Wrapt into Sable calls for Airs Rough, gloomy, as the Rug he wears, Pleasure, for ever on the Wing, Wild, wanton, restless, fluttering Thing, Airy springs by with sudden Speed, Swifter than Maro's flying Steed. Ah! where is hid the sylvan Scene, The leafy Shade, the vernal Green? In Flora's Meads the Sweets that grew, Colours which Nature's Pencil drew, Chaplets, the Bust of Pope might wear, Worthy to bloom around Ianthe's Hair? Gay-mantled Spring away is flown, The silver-tressed Summer's gone, And golden Autumn; nought remains But Winter with his iron Chains, The feather-footed Hours that fly Say, “Human Life thus passes by.” What shall the Wise, the Prudent? they Will seize the Bounty of To-day, And prostrate to the Gods their grateful Homage pay. The Man, whom Isis' Stream inspires, Whom Pallas owns, and Phœbus fires, Whom Suada, smiling Goddess, deigns To guide in sweet Hyblæan Plains, He Winter's Storms, undaunted still, sustains. Black lowring Skies ne'er hurt the Breast By white-rob'd Innocence possest. Roar as ye List, ye Winds,—begin,— Virtue proclaims fair Peace within: Ethereal Pow'r! 'tis you that bring The balmy Zephyrs, and restore the Spring. Should Dangers e'er my Friend assail, Virtue flings round her Coat of Mail; Kindly protects Thee from all Harms, Drest in her native spotless Charms. Thy Mind at ease no Tumult knows, With all his Rage tho' black November blows. Dark stormy Months I too defy, November blows, and what care I: Tun'd to new Joys my Hours are on the Wing, I blend the Dance or with the Muses sing: While Bacchus' Blessings varied Pleasures bring. With Horace now dispos'd to laugh, Worthy the Lips of Jove I quaff Rich Venusine: now lose my Soul In Ovid's sweet nectareal Bowl. If you, Calliope, should deign Aloud to sound a martial Strain, Your Vot'ry streight in Rapture hears The noble Music of the Spheres: Mounted on Wings, see! see! I fly With Mantua's Swan, and range the boundless Sky. With eager Joy I oft repair To the gay crouded Theatre, Where shines the Man who treads our Stage, Garrick! the Roscius of the Age! His Voice, Mien, Manner, Look, a Life imparts; 'Tis He who captivates our Eyes,—our Hearts. Vanbrugh,—your leave,—what's lewdly writ I hate,—I hate th' Immoral Wit. Immortal Shakespear I admire, And kindle at his sacred Fire: O! what a Glory breathes his Page, He lives?—He lives thro' ev'ry Age Father of Tragedy, He reigns Sole Monarch o'er Theatric Plains. Hence with the Sock:—the Queen commands:— Grac'd with the golden Buskin stands: The Stage in Majesty improves, Trembling beneath her, awful as she moves. What Thunder bursts!—it shakes the Heart— Thunder beyond the Reach of Art! The claps!—I heard 'em,—how they roll! The lovely Terror fills my Soul: Who talks of Fiends!—of gaping Graves!— Othello!—'tis Othello raves! What Tenderness!—what fierce Disdain Whirls, boils, and foams thro' ev'ry Vein! He swears!—invokes Hell, Earth, Air, Skies! See where the glorious Madman flies! He groans,—he trembles,—falls,—the Hero dies! Shakespear, excessive Joys like these (I almost said) are Cruelties: Whirlwinds of Pleasure tear the panting Breast, And the Mind akes, too exquisitely blest. Chang'd is the Scene:—methinks I rove In some enchanted Cypress-Grove, Soft Otway calls!—who can refuse The plaintive Voice of Otway's Muse? We'll go, my fair Ianthe, we will go, Tho' your fond love-inspiring Eyes o'erflow Like bubbling Springs, more beautiful in Woe. Sweet is the Sympathy of Woe; Have I not seen (nay felt 'em too) Down-stealing Tears, big, silent, slow, Speak a soft Language as they flow, Daughters of tender Grief, express Charming Monimia's deep Distress! What murmurs of the anxious Fair! What Sighs around perfume the Air! Otway, you paint what Nature is, Beyond, the Bard of Salamis; Your Muse can with our Passions play, And steal us from ourselves away. Let others prize, what Men bestow, The lofty Name, the laurel'd Brow: More charming, sure, thy Triumphs are (Who would not wish to win the Fair!) To raise at Pleasure Hopes, or Fears, To soften Virgins into Tears. Poet, I envy thee, who thus Canst conquer Them, who conquer Us. SPRING; A Translation of ODE VERNALIS. By the Reverend Mr. Tattersal, late Fellow of Trinity Coll. Cambridge. Care flies the Raptures of the Bowl, 'Tis jolly Bacchus fills my Soul; I feel within the genial Fire, And from yon Myrtle snatch my golden Lyre. To Thee the jocund Muse I send, With sprightly Lay to greet my Friend: For all Things now around look gay, Why mayn't I laugh, as well as They? The Fair, the Young, my Hours beguile, And Cytherea ever wears a Smile, Creative Goddess of the Spring! No more of Winter's Storms I sing, See May in wanton Joy appear Spread his gay Wings, and fan the buxom Year. My Friend (indulge the tender Name) My Friend, near Isis' sacred Stream With whom so oft I us'd to rove Careless, in Garden, Mead, or Grove; A Glass, a Song:—thus You and I Have bid the golden Minutes fly, Seen many a Sun, with sloaping Ray, Ling'ring retire, and blest the falling Day. O tell me what soft Triumphs now Wreath blooming Garlands round thy Brow; What Nymph, for winning Beauty known, Giving you Joy, compleats her own; Whether the Graces, or the Nine Divide thy Hours, for both are thine? 'Tis merry May, Swains, greet the Graces Shrine. To frolic on the tufted Grass, To view clear Waters as they pass, To mark the shining, shivering Gleam That darts, and dances on the Stream, To court the Muse, toy with the Fair, (Pleasures like these O! may I ever share) The Season bids: A Friend or two, Ingenious, affable, like you; Happy at sudden Reparties, Whose Answers bite, yet biting please, To kindle Mirth: and let me join Bacchus, the purple Sovereign of the Vine. May god-like Handel now inspire The tuneful Pow'rs, and fill the Choir: Ianthe, charming as she sings, Wake with a nimble Touch th' harmonious Strings. Listen, ye Heavens, to Strains, above Whate're the starry Court of Jove, Lost in melodious Raptures, hears Amid the silver-sounding Spheres; Where Orbs on Orbs in Concert rowl, And Musick trembles round from Pole to Pole. O melting Sound! when Sleep unseen Just steals upon the Cyprian Queen, Indulging in th' Idalian Shade, Stretcht on a Couch, of Roses made, The Lute soft-warbling, such the Air That undulating Plays, and lulls th' immortal Fair. The Flames that feed within my Breast! I faint, I dye, with Charms opprest; Her Voice, her Face, her sweet Spinnet, The Neck of Iv'ry, and the Hair of Jet. So languishes, and fades away The Flow'r beneath the Blaze of Day; Quick, my Companions, quick apply Some cooling, sovereign Remedy: Metcalf, to sooth a burning Pain, By Pæan taught, may try, but try in vain. Not Metcalf's Skill, tho' known to Fame, Can slake the Fury of my Flame, Not all his Juices quench; nor yet Dear Friend, the Flow of your engaging Wit. THE NATIVITY. A College-Exercise. 1736. I 'Twas Morn! the Fields were sprinkled o'er with Light, The Folds unpent sent out their Flocks to feed: A Shepherd-Boy, (young Thomalin he Named or called. hight,) With flying Fingers deftly tun'd his Reed; Where auncient Isis laves the Muses' Mead, (Forever Smile the Mead and flow the Stream!) He sung the Birth of David's holy Seed: Tho' low his Voice, full lofty was his Theme; Quickly.Wightly his Senses all were rapt into a Dream. II Immediately.Eftsoons he spy'd a Grove, the Season's Pride, All in the Centre of a pleasant Glade, Where Nature flowrish'd like a Virgin-Bride; Mantled with Green, with Hyacinths inlay'd, And Crystal-Rills o'er Beds of Lillies stray'd; The blue-ey'd Violet and King-Cup gay, And newblown-Roses, smiling sweetly-red, Outglow'd the blushing Infancy of Day, While amorous West-Winds kist their fragrant Souls away. III A rich Pavilion rear'd within its Height, The Capitals and Freezes Gold entire, Glist'ning with Carbuncles; a various Light Wav'd tremulous, and set the Eye on Fire. A silken Curtain, drawn on silver Wire, And ting'd with Colours of the summer Sky, Flow'd round, and bade the ruder Gales retire. Four Forms attendant at the Portals lie, The same Ezekiel saw with keen-prophetic Eye. IV Unlike, O much unlike, the strawy Shed, Where Mary, Queen of Heaven, in humbless Huimility. Lay, Where Formerly, someiime since. erst the Infant-God repos'd his Head, And deign'd to dwell in Tenement of Clay; The clouded Tabernacle of the Day! The Shepperd's Dream was mystical, I think. I ween, Isaiah on his Bosom pour'd a Ray, And painted to his Eyes the gentle Scene, Where Lions dandled Lambs; O Peace, thy golden Reign! V High-smiling in Delight a Lady sate. Young as the dawning Morn, on Iv'ry Throne; Upon her Looks the Virgin-Virtues wait, The Virgin-Virtues wait on Her alone! Her Sapphire-Eyes with gentle Spirit shone: Fair Bountyhead was open'd in her Face, Of Honour and of Love the The Pattern or Model. Paragon! A sweet Regard and most auspicious Grace Bespoke her Lineage high: She was of David's Race. VI Upon her Lap a lovely Infant lay, And ken'd the Mother by her smiling Grace. His Looks were radiant as the Bloom of Day, And Angel-Sweetness purpled in his Face. Oh! how the Mother did the Babe embrace With tender Blandishment and fondling Care! She gaz'd, and gaz'd, Nor. ne cou'd enough caress His Cheeks, as Roses red, as Lillies fair, The holy Day-Spring hight, Heav'ns everlasting Heir! VII Near Him a goodly Pers'nage mildly shone, With Looks of Love, and shedding Peace and Joy: Her Looks were Love, soft-streaming from the Throne Of Grace, and sweetly melted on the Boy: Her Tongue drop'd Honey, which wou'd never cloy. Mercy Called or named. yclep'd. All Nature on her hung, To drink her Manna and her Smiles enjoy; Young laughing Angels “Mercy, Mercy,” sung; Heav'n echo'd “Mercy” back, the Spheres with “Mercy”rung. VIII Thus if the Clouds, enroll'd with deadly Food, Forget to thunder in the æthereal Tow'rs, But silently dissolve in kindly Mood, In fostering Dews, and Balm, and Honey-Show'rs, Laugh all the Fields for Joy, and all the Bow'rs. The Shrubs and Herbs fresh Odours round them fling, Pop up their smiling Heads the little Flow'rs, Warble the Birds, exulting on the Wing, And all the wild-wood Notes the genial Blessings sing. IX High o'er his Head was held a starry Crown, Emblem of Royalty and princely Might: His Priesthood was by golden Mitre shewn; An Eagle Young, with E'yn most piercing-bright, To prove the Prophet drank the distant Light. But strangest was to see a bloody Hand Uprear a Cross, the Cross with Blood Stained or adorned. bedight: Ten thousand Angels, flutt'ring in a Band, Admir'd the mystic Sign but cou'd not understand. X Now dulcet Symphonies, and Voices meet, Mellifluous stole upon the Shepherd's Ear, Which swell'd so high and dy'd away so sweet, As might have charm'd a Seraph from his Sphere. Happy the Swain that Might or must. mote such Music hear! Eftsoons a joyous Fellowship was seen Of Ladies Gentle or handsome. gent, and Beauties without Without Equal. peer, As they a Train of Goddesses had been, In manner of a Mask, radiant along the Green. XI Faith led the Van, her Mantle dipt in Blue, Steady her Ken, and gaining on the Skies; Obedient Miracles around her flew: She pray'd, and Heav'n burst open on her Eyes, And golden Valves roll'd back in wond'rous Wise: And now some Hill, with all its shaggy Load Of Trees and Flocks, unto the Ocean Hastens. hies: Now Wings of Cherubs, flaming all abroad, Careering on the Winds in Sight upbear their God. XII Next Hope, the gayest Daughter of the Sky! Her nectar-dewed Locks with Roses bound; An Eden flourish'd where she cast her Eye, And Flocks of Sports and Joys, their Temples crown'd, Plum'd their bright Wings, and thump'd the hollow Ground. Grief gladden'd, and forgot to drop a Tear At her Approach; ne Sorrow Might. mote be found, Ne rueful-looking Fear or Terror. Drad, ne pale-ey'd Care; And 'neath her Chariot Wheels she crush'd hell-black Despair. XIII Then Charity full-zon'd, as her beseems, Her Breasts were softer Ivory, her Hair Play'd with the sunny Rays in amber Streams, And floated wanton on the buxom Air; As Mercy kind, as Hope divinely fair. Her Soul was Flame, and with prolific Rays The Nations warm'd, all-bright withouten Glare. Both Men and Angels, as she passes, gaze, But chief the Poor, the Lame, the Blind, the Naked, praise. XIV The Train of Virtues next, a dainty Train! Advance their Steps, sweet Daughters of Delight, Awfully sweet, majestically plain! Celestial Love, as E'yn of Seraphs bright, And spotless as their Robes of new-spun Light. Truth, simple as the love-sick Village-Maid; Health-blooming Temperance, a comely Person. Wight: Humility, in homely Weeds array'd, And by her, in a Line, an Asses-Colt she led. XV But heark, the jolly Pipe, and rural Lay! And see, the Shepherd clad in Mantle blue, And Shepherdess in russet Kirtle gay, Come dauncing on the Shepherd-Lord to view, And pay, in decent Wise, Obeysance due. Sweet-smelling Flow'rs the gentle Votaries bring, Primroses, Violets, wet with Morning-Dew, The sweetest Incense of the early Spring; A humble, yet, I weet, a grateful Offering. XVI Jocund to lead the Way, with sparkling Rays, Danc'd a Star-errant up the orient Sky; The new-born Splendor streaming o'er the Place, Where Jesus lay in bright Humility, Seem'd a fixt Star unto the wond'ring Eye: Three Seers Unknown, unlook'd for. unwist the Captain-Glory led, Of awful Appearance. Semblance, but of Commonly painted Black; but a Vulgar Error. sable Die. Full royally along the Lawn They tread, And each with circling Gold Adorned or made brave. embraved had his Head. XVII Low, very low on bended Knee they greet The Virgin-Mother, and the Son adore, The Son of Love! and kiss his blessed Feet; Then ope the Vases and present their Store, Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh; what cou'd they more! For Gold and Myrrh a dying King Foretell. divine; The Frankincense, from Arab's spicy Shoar, Confess'd the God; for God did in him Shine: Myrrh, Frankincense and Gold, God-Man, were meetly Thine. XVIII And last, triumphant on a purple Cloud, Fleecy with Gold, a Band of Angels ride: They boldly sweep their Lyres, and, hymning loud, The richest Notes of Harmony divide; Scarce Thomalin the Rapture cou'd abide: And ever and anon the Babe they eye, And through the fleshly Veil the God descry'd, Shrill Hallelujahs tremble up the Sky: “Good-Will and Peace to Man,” the Choirs in Heav'n reply. XIX They ended: and all Nature soon was chang'd! O'er Diamond-Pebbles ran the liquid Gold: And side by side the Lamb and Lion rang'd The flow'ry Lawn. The Serpent gently roll'd His glistering Spires, and playfull Tongue outloll'd To lick the Infant-Hand. Together fed The Wolf and Kid, together sought a Fold. The Roses blush'd with more celestial Red; Hell groan'd through all her Dens; and grim Death drop'd down dead. XX Formerly, sometime ago.Whilom these Scenes the tuneful Twick'nham Swain, With Esay's heav'nly Pencil taught to glow: Then cease, O cease, the antiquated Strain; Nor Spoil. marr His Song: but reverently go, And in the Temple of his Muses bow.— Delight and Wonder broke the Shepherd's Dream; Faded the Scenes: and, in a goodly Row, Rush'd on his Eyes the Muses well-lov'd Theme, Fair Rhedicyna's Tow'rs, and Isis' sacred Stream! THE BOWER. I Blow, blow, thou Summer-Breeze, O gently fan the Trees, That form yon fragrant Bow'r; Where Sylvia, loveliest Maid! On Nature's Carpet laid, Enjoys the Ev'ning Hour. II Hence, hence, ye Objects foul, The Beetle, Bat, and Owl, The Hagworm, Neute, and Toad; But Fairy-Elves, unseen, May gambol o'er the Green, And circle her Abode. III Breathe, breathe thy Incence, May; Ye Flow'rs, your homage pay, To One more fair and sweet: Ye op'ning Rose-Buds, shade, With fragrant Twine, her Head, Ye Lillies, kiss her Feet. IV Shed, shed thy sweetest Beams, In particolour'd Streams, Thou Fount of Heat and Light! No, no, withdraw thy Ray, Her Eyes effuse a Day, As mild, as warm, as bright. V Flow, flow, thou Crystal-Rill, With tinkling gurgles fill The Mazes of the Grove: And if thy murmuring Stream Invite my Love to dream, O may She dream of Love! VI Sing, sing ye feather'd Quires, And melt to soft Desires Her too obdurate Breast: Then, in that tender Hour, I'll steal into her Bow'r, And teach Her—to be blest. THE LOVER. I Since Stella's Charms, divinely fair, First pour'd their Lustre on my Heart, Ten thousand Pangs my Bosom tear, And ev'ry Fibre feels the Smart. If such the mournful Moments prove, O who wou'd give his Heart to Love! II I meet my Bosom-Friends with pain, Tho' Friendship us'd to warm my Soul; Wine's generous Spirit flames in vain, I find no Cordial in the Bowl. If such the mournful Moments prove, O who wou'd give his Heart to Love! III Tho' Nature's Volume open lies, Which once with Wonder I have read, No Glories tremble from the Skies, No Beauties o'er the Earth are spread. If such the mournful Moments prove, O who wou'd give his Heart to Love! IV Ev'n Poetry's ambrosial Dews With Joy no longer feed my Mind, To Beauty, Musick and the Muse, My Soul is dumb and deaf and blind. Tho' such the mournful Moments prove, Alass! I give my Heart to Love. V But shou'd the yielding Virgin smile, Drest in the spotless Marriage-Robe, I'd look upon this World as vile, The Master of a richer Globe. If such the rap'trous Moments prove, O let me give my Heart to Love! VI The Business of my future Days, My every Thought, my every Pray'r, Shall be employ'd to sing her Praise, Or sent to bounteous Heav'n for Her. If such the rapt'rous Moments prove, O let me give my Heart to Love! VII Poets shall wonder at my Love, Painters shall crowd her Face to see, And when they wou'd the Passions move, Shall copy Her, and think of me. If such the rapt'rous Moments prove, O let me give my Heart to Love. VIII Old Age shall burn as bright as Youth, No respite to our Bliss be given: Then mingled in one Flame of Truth, We'll spurn at Earth and soar to Heav'n. Since such the rapt'rous Moments prove, We Both will give our Hearts to Love. THE LOVER'S NIGHT. I Lull'd in the Arms of Him She lov'd Ianthe sigh'd the kindest Things: Her fond Surrender He approv'd With Smiles; and thus, enamour'd, sings. II “How sweet are Lover's Vows by Night, Lap'd in a Honey-suckle Grove! When Venus sheds her gentle Light, And sooths the yielding Soul to Love. III Soft as the silent-footed Dews That steal upon the Starlight-Hours; Warm as a love-sick Poet's Muse; And fragrant as the Breath of Flow'rs. IV To hear our Vows the Moon grows pale, And pants Endymion's Warmth to prove: While, emulous, the Nightingale, Thick-warbling trills her Lay of Love. V The silver-sounding-shining Spheres, That animate the glowing Skies, Nor charm so much, as Thou, my Ears, Nor bless so much, as Thou, my Eyes. VI Thus let me clasp Thee to my Heart, Thus sink in Softness on thy Breast! No Cares, shall haunt Us; Danger, part, For ever loving, ever blest. VII Censorious Envy dares not blame The Passion which thy Truth inspires: Ye Stars, bear witness that my Flame Is chaste as your eternal Fires.” VIII Love saw Them (hid among the Boughs) And heard Him sing their mutual Bliss: “Enjoy, cry'd He, Ianthe's Vows; But, oh!—I envy Thee her Kiss.” TO A Friend on his MARRIAGE. An Ode. I Auspicious sprung the Morning into Light By Love selected from the golden Tide Of Time, illustrious with peculiar White, And mended from the Blushes of the Bride. II The Muse observ'd the fond-approaching Hour, And thus her Philo's gentle Ear addrest. “Behold, descending from yon Maiden Tow'r The beauteous Object of thy Eyes and Breast. III Fair issuing, down the Hill I see her move, Like the sweet Morn, in Dews and Blushes gay: You, like the Bridegroom Sun, her Charms approve; And warm her dawning Glories into Day. IV I own the radiant Magic of her Eyes, But more the Graces of her Soul admire; Those may lay Traps for Lovers, Fops and Flies, But These the Husband and the Muse inspire. V A Husband is a venerable Name! O happy State, when Heart is link'd to Heart! Nor less the Honour of the Wedded-Dame: Sweet Interchange! which only Death can part. VI O blest with gentle Manners, graceful Ease; Gay, yet not trifling; serious, yet not grave; Skillful, to charm the Wits; the Wise, to please; Tho' beauteous, humble; and tho' tender, brave. VII Riches and Honours wait on either Name: But They in Life are but the last Desert: Your richer Happiness and fairer Fame, Shall be the good Behaviour of the Heart. VIII When such the Wonders both of Form and Mind, What Rapture fancy'd, Reason will approve; By Time your Inclinations be refin'd; And Youth, be spent in Passion; Age in Love?” IX Thus far the Muse. When Hymen, from the Sky, The Lovers in the Band of Concord ty'd; The Virtues and the Graces too were by, And Venus left her Cestus with the Bride. On the DEATH of Mr. Wearing, the Famous Musician at Oxford. I Poor Wearing to the Shades is gone, Like Orpheus, by mishap: Not gone to seek his Wife, but gone, To leave her in—a Scrape. II We find the Sisters three are deaf, Since Wearing now is dead; For had the Fates but heard his Strings, They wou'd have spar'd his Thread. III Death heard his Notes, and heard well-pleas'd, So drew his fatal Lance; Death will keep Holyday; and He Must play to Holben's Dance. To Dr. Linden, ON HIS TREATISE on CHALYBEAT WATERS. With healing Wings, intent on doing Good, An Angel visited Bethesda's Flood; Quick as the Morning Ray, or Ev'ning Beam, Himself diffusing through the Vital Stream: The Sick who drink, the Impotent who lave, Dive from Diseases, and deceive the Grave. Tho' Miracles are ceas'd, yet all confess, Your Work, and You, are—only something less. So much is to your Worth and Learning due, Bath is Bethesda; the Good Angel, You. PARADISE REGAIN'D: To a Friend. I Lord of Himself, and Sole of Humankind, In Rectitude of Reason Adam shone: Till the Still-Voice infus'd into his Mind, “It is not good for Man to be alone.” II By God's own Hand his Virgin-Eve was led. Now Paradise with fresher Beauties glows: The conscious Roses form a blushing bed: Consenting Nature sooths Them to repose. III A Single is an inconsistent-Life: Compleatly-blest, O Friend! to Thee is given, A sweet, a fair, a wise, a modest Wife, The Bloom of Innocence, and Blush of Heav'n! IV May Eden-Life in bright Succession flow, When All was Happiness, for Love was All: Her Beauties will a Paradise bestow, And both your Virtues guard you from a Fall. CORESUS and CALLIRHOE. A TALE. Veteres Renovamus Amores. Catullus. High in Achaia, splendid from afar, A City flourish'd; Calydon its Name, Wash'd by Evenus' chalky Flood; the Seat Of Meleager, from the slaughter'd Boar Glorious. A Virgin here, amazing, shone, Callirhoe the fair: her Father's Boast! For, ah! she never knew a Mother's Smile; Nor learn'd what Happiness from Marriage springs. In Flow'r of Youth, and purer than the Snow, Which, with a silver Circle, crown'd the Head Of the steep neighbour Mountain; but averse To Hymen's Rites, the lovely Foe of Man. O why will Beauty, cruel to itself, No less than others, violate the Laws Which Nature dictates, and Itself inspires! A thousand Lovers from th' Olenian Hill, From rough Pylene, and from Pleuron's Towr's, Their Passion pleaded. But Coresus, chief, The Calydonian Priest of Bacchus, form'd By Venus' self for Love; in Beauty's Pride; Young, bounteous, affable. What tender Arts, What winning Carriage, and respectful Suit, Almost to zealous Adoration swell'd, Did he not practise? But in vain, And now Drew near the Orgial Festival, and Rites Lyæan. Poor Coresus, to approve The Wonders of his Love and dear Regard, By Scorn unquench'd, and growing by Neglect, (In Hopes to soften her, at least adorn) Presented to this Murdress of his Peace The ritual Ornaments, by Virgins worn Upon the solemn Feast. The Ivy-Spear, With winding Green, and viny Foliage gay, Curl'd by his Hand: a Mitre for his Head, Curious aumail'd with imitated Grapes, Of blushing Rubies form'd: the Pall of Lawn, Flow'r'd with the Conquests of the purple God: The Cista, Silver; and the Cymbals, Gold: And Piny Torch (O were it Hymen's!) ting'd With spicy Gums, to feed the ready Flame. Open'd the Festival—Loose to the Winds, Dishevel'd, bare, the Virgins give their Necks And wanton Hair. Evœ! they mad'ning cry, And shake their Torches. Evœ! Io! rends The Air, and beats the echoing Vault of Heav'n. The Hills, the Vales with Io! Evœ! ring. The Temple opens to the sacred Throng; When foremost enters, as in Dress and Charms, Callirhoe, so in Speed. Their Lovers wait, With burning Expectation, to enfold His beauteous Mistress each. High on a Throne Coresus blaz'd in Jewels and in Gold, More charming in Himself. Quick with his Eye He catch'd Callirhoe, and, descending, clasp'd With eager Transport her reluctant Waist. A thousand Vows he breath'd, and melting Things He spoke and look'd; but to the Rocks and Wind. What cou'd he more? Yes more he did: for what, What can't a Lover, like Coresus, do? Neglectful of his Dignity he sunk (Still Love disdains what Dignity demands, O'er Jupiter himself supreme) he sunk, And trembled at her Feet, with prostrate Zeal, As to his God. He dy'd upon her Hand With sighing Languishment: He gaz'd his Soul At every ardent Glance into her Eyes; Most eloquently silent! O'er his Cheek The gushing Tears, in big, round drops, diffus'd The Dews of Passion, and the Brain's soft Show'r, Potent to warm the most obdurate Breast, Tho' cold as Marble. Idle were his Tears, His Glances, Languishment and prostrate Zeal. Disdainful—frowning: “Hence, (she cry'd) nor dare To interrupt my Progress in the Rites With thy capricious Rudeness. Shall the Priest The Mysteries of Bacchus thus profane, In his own Temple too? And rather pay To Venus his Devotion, than his God?” Then, haughty as away she turn'd, he grasp'd Her Knees; upon her Garments flowing train Shivering he hung: and with beseeching Eyes, Thus, from th' Abundance of his Heart, complain'd. “If Pity be no Stranger to thy Breast, (As sure it should not to a Breast like thine, Soft as the Swanny Down!) relenting, hear; In Feelingness of Spirit, mildly lend Attention to the Language of my Heart, Sick with o'er-flowing Tenderness and Love. I love thee with that Innocence of Truth, That Purity of Passion, and Desire Unutterable, of bequeathing up My Heart, my Life, my All into thy Hands, Into thy gentle Custody;—that All, My Heart, my Life, are Bitterness and Weight Of Agony without thee. Since I first, (By Bacchus' self I swear,) beheld that Face, And nameless Magick of those radiant Eyes, All the Foundation of my Peace gave way: While Hopes and Fears rose up in bosom-War To desolate the Quiet of my Days. Thy dear Idea was my fancy's Dream; It mingled with my Blood; and in my Veins Throb'd, undulating, as my Life were stung. I live but on the Thought of Thee; my Breast Bleeds in me, with Distress to see Thee frown. O smile! by thy dead Mother's reverend Dust, By all thy Bowels are most fond of, smile, And chase these heavy Clouds of Grief away. I beg by Bacchus; for His Sake be kind.” Here, interrupted by the swelling Storm Of Passion labouring in his Breast, his Words Gave way for Sighs and Tears to speak the Rest. She, in contempt'ous Derision, smil'd, To which her Frowns were innocent: and thus: “Thy staggering Pow'r, and Thee I scorn alike; Him I despise, for chusing Thee his Priest; Thee, for thy Arrogance, and Courtship vile.” Indignant he, in wrathful Mood (alarm'd More at his God revil'd, than scorn for him) First casting on the Ground his Mitred-Crown, With Hands and Eyes uplifted, ardent, pray'd. “Offspring of Jove, Evœ Lyæus, hear! If e'er these Hands with Ivy Wreaths thy Brow Circled, and twining Tendrils of the Vine: If e're my grateful Tongue, big with thy Praise, Evœ Lyæus! Io Bacchus! sung: If e'er thy Servant on thy Altars pour'd, Copious, the purple Wave of offer'd Wine, And, busy, fed the consecrated Fire With Fat of Ass, or Hog, or mountain-Goat; Devoutly lavish in the Sacrifice: Avenge thy Priest; this cursed Race destroy: Thy Honours violated thus, avow; Till they confess this staggering Pow'r a God.” He pray'd.—Loud Peals of Thunder shook the Fane: The Image, nodding, his Petition seal'd; And Bacchus gave the Calydonian Race To Madness, and unutterable Woes. The frantick Crowd, as if with Wine possest, And the strong Spirit of the flaming Grape, To and fro' reel, and stagger to and fro', In Dithyrambic Measures, wild, convolv'd. They toss their Cymbals, and their Torches shake, Shrieking, and tear their Hair, and gash their Flesh, And howl, and foam, and wheel the rapid Dance In giddy Maze: with Fury then o'erborn, Euthusiastick, whirling in Despair, Flat, drop down dead; and Heaps on Heaps expire. Amaz'd, confounded at the raging Pest, The venerable Fathers, in debate, To speed enquiring Deputies, resolv'd, To high Dodona's Grove; with vocal Oaks Umbrageous, aged, vast, the struggling Day Excluding: the prime Oracle of Greece! Obsequious, they haste: enquire: return: And thus the Counsels of the God disclose. “The Rage of Bacchus for his injur'd Priest, Coresus, by Callirhoe's Scorn repuls'd, Your City wastes: and with funereal Fires Your Streets shall redden, formidably bright, Till by Coresus' Hand the cruel Maid A Sacrifice be offer'd up: or One, Free, uncompell'd, embrace the destin'd Steel, Devoted in her Stead; and bleed for Her. So you'll appease the God; the Plague be stay'd.” They said. Staring Affright, and dumb Amaze The Fathers seize: but chief, Æneùs, thee, Callirhoe's old miserable Sire! Tenfold Affliction to the Grave weighs down Thy silver'd Hairs. But Fate and Heav'n require. Soon through the City spred the News, and soon Wounded Callirhoe's Ear. Her Spindle drops Neglected from her Hand. Prone on the Floor, She falls, she faints; her Breath, her Colour fled: Pale, cold and pale. Till, by assisting Care, The fragrant Spirit hovers o'er her Lips, And Life returning streams in rosy Gales; Rekindled only to Despair. She knew The Virgins envy'd; and the injur'd Youth Stung with her Scorn, wou'd wanton in her Wounds, Nor one, one offer up the willing Breast A Victim for her Life. And now the Crowd, Impatient of their Miseries, besiege The marble Portal; burst the bolted Gates; Demand Callirhoe; furious to obey The Oracle, and pacify the God. What Pangs, unhappy Maid, thy bosom tear, Sleepless, and sad? relenting now too late, Thy stubborn Cruelty. Coresus' charms Blaze on thy Mind; his unexampled Love, His every Virtue rising to thy Thought. Just in his Fury, see the pointed Steel Waves, circling, o'er thy throbbing Breast: He strikes; He riots in thy Blood with dire Delight; Insatiate! He gluts his Heart of Rage With thy warm gushing Life; and Death enjoys, Redoubling Wound on Wound, and Blow on Blow. Thus pass'd her Hours. And now the dewy Morn The Mountains tip'd with Gold, and threatned Day. Without the City Gates, a Fountain wells Its living Waters, clear as shining Glass: Haunt of the Nymphs! A Cypress' aged Arms Threw round a venerable Gloom, and seem'd Itself a Grove. An Altar on the Brink Convenient rose: for holy Custom wills Each Victim to be sprinkled with its Streams, New from Pollution, worthier of the God. Fierce for the Sacrifice, Coresus here Waited; and, stimulated with Revenge, He curs'd and chid the lazy-circling Hours Too slow, as if injurious to his Hate. But soon the gath'ring Crowd and Shouts proclaim Callirhoe near. Her weeping Damsels lead The destin'd Offering, lovely in Distress, And sparkling through her Tears. A Myrtle Crown With Roses glowing, and selected Green, Th' ambrosial Plenty of her golden Hair Entwine: in looks, a Venus; and a Grace In Motion. Scarce the Flow'rs of sixteen Springs The Fields had painted, since Æneùs first Fondled his Babe, and blest her on his Knee. Ev'n Mountain-Clowns, who never Pity knew, Relented, and the hardest Heart wept blood, Subdu'd by Beauty, tho' the fatal Source Of all their Misery. What Tumults then Roll in thy Breast, Coresus! while thy Hands The purifying Waters on her Head Pour'd trembling; and the sacred Knife unsheath'd! Wiping the silver-streaming Tears away, She with a Look nor chearful, nor dismay'd, But languishingly sweet, her ruby Lips Soft-op'ning, thus began: “Father and Friends, Wound me not doubly with your tender Grief: I was not born alone for you. My Life I gladly offer for my Country's Weal: 'Tis Glory thus to die. Receive my Blood, Dear native Soil! O may it Health restore And Peace; and Bacchus' Wrath be now appeas'd. And thou, Coresus, whom I most have wrong'd, Look no so fiercely on me, while the Steel My once-lov'd Bosom launces; drop a Tear; One Sigh in Mercy heave, and drop one Tear, And I will thank Thee for thy Blow. For, oh I never hated Thee: but Female-Pride, Our Sex's Curse! forbade me to comply, Too easy won!—Then pity me, Coresus; O pity; and, if possible, forgive.” He answer'd not: but, ardent, snatch'd the Knife, And, running o'er her Beauties, strangely wild, With Eyes which witness'd huge Dismay and Love, “Thus, thus I satisfy the Gods!” He cry'd, And bury'd in his Heart, in his own Heart, The guilty Blade. Then, reeling to her Arms, He sunk, and groaning, “O Callirhoe!”—dy'd. Heav'n rings with Shouts, “Was ever Love like this?” Callirhoe shriek'd; and from the gaping Wound, Quick as the Light'nings Wing, the reeking Knife Wrench'd: in an Agony of Grief and Love, Her Bosom piercing, on his Bosom fell, And sigh'd upon his Lips her Life away. Their Blood uniting in a friendly Stream, With bubbling Purple stain'd the Silver-Flood, Which to the Fountain gave Callirhoe's Name. To Miss Addison. On seeing Mr. Rowe's MONUMENT in Westminster Abbey. Erected at the Expence of his Widow. Late an Applauding People rear'd the Stone To Shakespear's Honour, and, alike, their Own. A perfect Whole, where Part consents to part; The Wonder He of Nature, This of Art. And now a Wife (ye Wits, no more despise The Name of Wife) bids Rowe in Marble rise. Smiling He views her conjugal Regard; A Nation's Cost had been a less Reward: A Nation's Praise may vulgar Spirits move, Rowe more deserv'd and gain'd,—a Sponsal Love. O Italy! thy injur'd Marble keep Deep in thy Bowels, providently deep, When Fools wou'd force it over Knaves to weep. But when true Wit and Merit claim a Shrine, Pour forth thy Stores and beggar every Mine. They claim Them now: for Virtue, Sense and Wit Have long been fled, and want thy Succours—Yet: They claim Them now for One,—yes, One I see:— Marble wou'd weep—if Addison be He. O crown'd with all the Glories of thy Race, The Father's Candour, and the Mother's Grace! With Rowe, Charlotta! vie, in generous Strife, And let the Daughter emulate the Wife. Be justly pious; raise the Honour'd Stone, And so—deserve a Rowe, or—Addison! THE MILKMAID. I 'Twas at the cool and fragrant Hour, When Ev'ning steals upon the Sky, That Lucy sought a Wood-bine-Grove, And Colin taught the Grove to sigh; The sweetest Damsel She, on all the Plains; The softest Lover He, of all the Swains. II He took her by the Lilly-Hand, Which oft had made the Milk look pale; Her Cheeks with modest Roses glow'd, As thus He breath'd his tender Tale: The list'ning Streams awhile forgot to flow, The Doves to murmur, and the Breeze to blow. III “O smile my Love! thy dimply Smiles Shall lengthen on the setting Ray: Thus let us melt the Hours in Bliss, Thus sweetly languish Life away: Thus sigh our Souls into each other's Breast, As true as Turtles, and as Turtles blest! IV So may thy Cows for ever Crown With Floods of Milk thy brimming Pail; So may thy Cheese all Cheese surpass, So may thy Butter never fail: So may each Village round this Truth declare, That Lucy is the fairest of the Fair. V Thy Lips with Streams of Honey flow, And pouting swell with healing Dews; More Sweets are blended in thy Breath, Than all thy Father's Fields diffuse: Tho' thousand Flow'rs adorn each blowing Field, Thy lovely Cheeks more blooming Beauties yield. VI Too long my erring Eyes had rov'd On City-Dames in Scarlet drest; And scorn'd the charmfull Village-Maid, With Innocence and Grogram blest: Since Lucy's native Graces fill'd my Sight, The painted City-Dames no more delight. VII The speaking Purple, when you blush, Out-glows the Scarlet's deepest Die; No Diamonds tremble on thy Hair, But brighter sparkle in thy Eye. Trust me, the smiling Apples of thy Eyes, Are tempting as were Those in Paradise. VIII The tunefull Linnet's warbling Notes, Are gratefull to the Shepherd-Swain; To drooping Plants, and thirsty Fields The silver Drops of kindly Rain; To Blossoms, Dews, as Blossoms to the Bee; And thou, my Lucy! only art to Me. IX But mark, my Love! yon Western-Clouds: With liquid Gold they seem to burn: The Ev'ning Star will soon appear, And overflow his Silver Urn. Soft Stillness now, and falling Dews invite To taste the balmy Blessings of the Night. X Yet e're we part, one Boon I crave, One tender Boon! nor this denye: O promise that You still will love, O promise this! or else I dye: Death else my only Remedy must prove; I'll cease to live, whene're you cease to love.” XI She sigh'd and blush'd a sweet Consent; Joyous He thank'd Her on his Knee, And warmly press'd her Virgin-Lip.— Was ever Youth so blest as He!— The Moon, to light the Lovers homeward, rose, And Philomela lull'd Them to Repose. THE CONQUEST. I When Phebus heard Ianthe sing And sweetly bid the Groves rejoice, Jealous He smote the trembling String, Despairing, quite, to match her Voice. II Smiling, her Harpsicord She strung: As soon as She began to play, Away his Harp poor Phebus flung; It was no Time for Him to stay. III Yet hold; before your Godship go The Fair shall gain another Prize: Your Voice and Lyre's outdone, you know; Nor less thy Sunshine by her Eyes. THE BEE. I Leave, wanton Bee, those Blossoms leave, Thou buzzing Harbinger of Spring, To Stella fly, and sweeter Spoils Shall load thy Thigh, and gild thy Wing. II Her Cheeks, her Lips with Roses swell, Not Paphian Roses deeper glow; And Lillies o'er her Bosom spread Their spotless Sweets, and balmy Snow. III Then, grateful for the Sacred Dews, Invite her, humming round, to Rest; Soft Dreams may tune her Soul to Love, Tho' Coldness arm her waking Breast. IV But if She still obdurate prove, O shoot thy Sting.—The little Smart May teach her then to pity me Transfix'd with Love's and Beauty's Dart. V Ah no, forbear, to sting forbear; Go, fly unto thy Hive again. Much rather let me dye for Her, Than She endure the least of Pain. VI Go, fly unto thy Hive again, With more than Hybla-Honey blest: For Pope's sweet Lips prepare the Dew, Or else for Love a Nectar-Feast. THE MORNING LARK. Anacreontick. I Feather'd Lyrick! warbling high, Sweetly gaining on the Sky, Op'ning with thy Matin-Lay (Nature's Hymn!) the Eye of Day, Teach my Soul, on early Wing, Thus to soar, and thus to sing. II While the Bloom of orient Light Gilds Thee in thy tuneful Flight, May the Day-Spring-from-on-High, Seen by Faith's religious Eye, Cheer Me with his Vital Ray, Promise of Eternal Day! Written in a Window at the Three-Tuns Tavern, Oxford; May 29th.ANNA MARIA W??DF??RD! “Go, Anna! (Nature said) to Oxford go: (Anna! the fairest Form and Mind below, Blest with each Gift of Nature and of Art To charm the Reason, or to fix the Heart.) Go with a sprightly Wit and easy Mien, To prove the Graces four, the Muses Ten. I see the Wits adore, the Wise approve, Ev'n Fops themselves have almost Sense to love. When Poets wou'd describe a Lip or Eye, They'll look on Thee and lay their Ovids by. I see a love-sick Youth, with Passion fir'd, Hang on thy charms, and gaze to be inspir'd. With asking Eyes explain his silent Woes, Glow as he looks, yet tremble as he glows: Then drunk with Beauty, with a warmer Rage, Pour thy soft Graces through the Tragic-Page. He sighs;—He bleeds;—to twilight Shades He flies: Shakespear He drops, and with his Otway dies. This Pomp of Charms you owe to Me alone, The Charms which scarce six thousand Years have known. That Face, illumin'd softly by the Mind; That Body, almost to a Soul refind; That Sweetness, only to an Angel giv'n; That Blush of Innocence, and Smile of Heav'n! I bade thy Cheeks with Morning-Purple glow; I bade thy Lips with Nectar-Spirit flow; I bade the Diamond point thy azure Eyes, Turn'd the fine Waist, and taught the Breast to rise. Whether thy Silver Tides of Musick roul, Or Pencil on the Canvass strikes a Soul, Or curious Needle pricks a Band or Heart, At once a Needle, and at once a Dart! All own that Nature is alone thy Art. Why thus I form'd thy Body and thy Mind With sumless Graces, prodigally kind, The Reason was,—but you in Time will know it;— One is, but that's the least—to make a Poet. MINERVA MISTAKEN. Minerva last Week (pray let no Body doubt it) Went an Airing from Oxford, six Miles, or about it: When She spy'd a young Virgin so blooming and fair, That, “O Venus, (She cry'd) is your Ladyship there? Pray is not that Oxford? and lately you swore Neither You, nor one like you, shou'd trouble Us more. Do you thus keep your promise? and am I defy'd?” The Virgin came nearer and smiling reply'd, “My Goddess! what, have you your Pupil forgot?”— —“Your pardon, my Dear, is it you, Molly S?? THE MAGI. A Sacred Eclogue. No more in Beauty's Praise my Numbers move, Nor melt away in dying falls of Love: A Child on Earth, yet Heaven's eternal King, The manger'd God, the Virgin's Son I sing. Thou Fountain-Good, with Light my Soul o'erflow, With hallow'd Ardour bid my Bosom glow! Fir'd at the promise of thy dawning Ray, The Eastern Sages found Celestial Day. Drawn by a leading Flame, with sweet surprize, The Infant Deity salutes their Eyes. The Heir-elect of Love his Mother prest, Smil'd in her Arms, and wanton'd on her Breast. No Jewels sparkle here, nor India's Stores The Portals brighten or emblaze the Doors. But young-ey'd Seraphims around Him glow, And Mercy spreads her many-colour'd Bow! Her Bow, compos'd of new-created Light, How sweetly lambent and how softly bright! The sacred Circle of embodied Rays The Cradle crowns, and round his Temples plays. So shines the Rainbow round th' eternal Throne To shade the Holy, Holy, Holy One. By turns the Ruby bleeds a Beam, by turns, Smiles the green Em'rald, and the Topaz burns: The various Opal mingles every Ray, Fades into Faintness, deepens into Day: Promiscuous Lustre kindles half the Skies, Too slippery-bright for keen-Seraphick Eyes. The venerable Three, low-bending down, Extend their Offerings and the Godhead own. Mag. I. From Eastern Realms, where first the infant Sight Springs into Day and streaks the fading Night, To Thee we bend, before the Morning Rise; A purer Morning trembles from thy Eyes. Mag. II. In vain the Sun with Light his Orb arrays, Our Sense to dazzle, and as God to blaze; Through his transparent Fallacy we See, And own the Sun is but a Star to Thee. Mag. III. Thou spotless Essence of primeval Light, Thy Vassals own, and wash thy Ethiops White. Thy Cloud of sable Witnesses adorn With the first Roses of thy smiling Morn. Mag. I. By Bards foretold the ripen'd Years are come, Gods fall to Dust and Oracles are dumb. Old Ocean murmurs from his Ouzy Bed, “A Maid has born a Son, and Pan is dead. Mag. II. The Nymphs, their Flow'r-inwoven Tresses torn, O'er Fountains weep, in twilight Thickets mourn. Long, hollow Groans, deep Sobs, thick Schreeches fill Each dreary Vally and each shaded Hill. Mag. III. No more shall Memphian Timbrels wake the Morn, No more shall Hammon lift his gilded Horn. From hence in vain shall Belzebub rebell, Anubis howls, and Moloch sinks to Hell. Mag. I. Here lows a Bull; a golden Gleam adorns The circling Honours of his beamy Horns. He safely lows, nor fears the Holy Knife, No Sacrifice from hence shall drink his Life. Mag. II. Ye Gardens, blush with never-fading Flowr's, For ever smile, ye Meads, and blow, ye Bowr's: Bleat, all ye Hills, be whiten'd, all ye Plains; O Earth, rejoice! th' Eternal Shepherd reigns. Mag. III. Ye Lillies, dip your Leaves in falling Snow, Ye Roses, with the Eastern-Scarlet glow, To crown the God: ye Angels, haste to pour Your Rain of Nectar, and your Starry Show'r. Mag. I. Offers Gold. The Ore of India ripens into Gold, To gild thy Courts, thy Temple to infold. Accept the Emblematick Gift; again Saturnian Years revolve a Golden Reign! Mag. II. Offers Frankincense. For Thee Arabia's happy Forests rise, And Clouds of Odours sweetly stain the Skies. While fragrant Wreaths of smoaking Incense roll, Receive our Pray'rs, the Incense of the Soul! Mag. III. Offers Myrrh. The weeping Myrrh with balmy Sorrow flows, Thy Cup to sweeten and to sooth thy Woes: So Prophets sing; for (Human and Divine) The Man was born to grieve, the God to shine. Mag. I. Smile, sacred Infant, smile: thy rosy Breast Excels the Odours of the spicy East; The burnish'd Gold is Dross before thy Eye, Thou God of Sweetness, God of Purity! Mag. II. Ye Planets, unregarded walk the Skies, Your Glories lessen as his Glories rise: His radiant Word with Gold the Sun attires, The Moon illumes, and lights the Starry Fires. Mag. III. Hail, Lord of Nature, hail! To Thee belong My Song, my Life,—I give my Life, my Song: Walk in thy Light, adore thy Day alone, Confess thy Love, and pour out all my own. On Mr. Pope's WORKS. Written soon after his Death. Man not alone hath End: In measur'd Time, (So Heav'n has will'd) together with their Snows The everlasting Hills shall melt away: This solid Globe dissolve, as ductile Wax Before the Breath of Vulcan; like a Scroll Shrivel th' unfolded Curtains of the Sky; Thy Planets, Newton, tumble from their Spheres, That lead harmonious on their mystic Rounds: The Moon be perisht from her bloody Orb; The Sun himself, in liquid Ruin, rush And deluge with destroying Flames the Globe— Peace then, my Soul, nor grieve that Pope is dead. If 'ere the tuneful Spirit, sweetly strong, Spontaneous Numbers, teeming in my Breast, Enkindle; O, at that exalting Name, Be favourable, be propitious now, While, in the gratitude of Praise, I sing The Works and Wonders of this Man divine. I tremble while I write.—His lisping Muse Surmounts the loftiest Efforts of my Age. What wonder? when an Infant, He apply'd The loud Translation of the First Book of Statius's Thebais. Papinian Trumpet to his Lips, Fir'd by a sacred Fury, and inspir'd With all the God, in sounding Numbers sung “Fraternal Rage, and guilty Thebes' Alarms.” Sure at his Birth (Things not unknown of old) The Graces round his Cradle wove the Dance, And led the Maze of Harmony: the Nine, Prophetick of his future Honours, pour'd Plenteous, upon his Lips Castalian Dews; And Attic Bees their golden store distill'd. The Soul of Homer, sliding from its Star, Where, radiant, over the poetic World It rules and sheds its Influence, for Joy Shouted, and bless'd the Birth: the sacred Choir Of Poets, born in elder, better Times, Enraptur'd, catch'd the elevating Sound, And roll'd the glad'ning News from Sphere to Sphere. O listen to Pastorals. Alexis' tender Plaint! How gently rural! without Coarseness, plain; How simple in his elegance of Grief! A Shepherd, but no Clown. His every Lay Sweet as the early Pipe along the Dale, When Hawthorns bud, or on the thymy Brow When all the Mountains bleat, and Vallies sing. Soft as the Nightingale's harmonious Woe, In dewy Even-Tide, when Cowslips drop Their sleepy Heads, and languish in the Breeze. Windsor-Forest. Mr. Pope born there.Imperial Windsor! on thy Brow august, Superbly gay, exalt thy tow'ry Head; (Much prouder of his Verse than of thy Stars) And bid thy Forests dance, and nodding, wave A verdant Testimony of thy Joy: A native Orpheus warbling in thy Shades. Essay on Criticism.Next, in the Critic-Chair survey him thron'd, Imperial in his Art, prescribing Laws Clear from the knitted Brow, and squinted Sneer; Learn'd, without Pedantry; correctly bold, And regularly Easy. Gentle, now, As rising Incense, or descending Dews, The variegated Echo of his Theme: Now, animated Flame commands the Soul To glow with sacred Wonder. Pointed Wit And keen Discernment form the certain Page. Just, as the Stagyrite; as Horace, free; As Fabian, clear; and as Petronius gay. Rape of the Lock.But whence those peals of Laughter shake the Sides Of decent Mirth? Am I in Fairy-Land? Young, evanescent Forms, before my Eyes, Or skim, or seem to skim; thin Essences Of fluid Light; Zilphs, Zilphids, Elves and Gnomes; Genij of Rosicruce, and Ladies' Gods!— And, lo, in shining trails, Belinda's Hair, Bespangling with dishevel'd Beams the Skies, Flames o'er the Night. Behind, a Satyr grins And, jocund, holds a Glass, reflecting, fair, Hoops, Crosses, Mattadores; Beaux, Shocks, and Belles, Promiscuously whimsical and gay. Tassoni, hiding his diminish'd Head, Droops o'er the laughing Page: while Boileau skulks, With Blushes cover'd, low beneath the Desk. Ovid's Sappho to Phaon. And Eloise to Abelard.More mournful Scenes invite. The milky Vein Of amorous Grief devolves its placid Wave Soft-streaming o'er the Soul, in weeping Woe And Tenderness of Anguish. While we read Th' infectious Page, we sicken into Love, And languish with involuntary Fires. The Zephyr, panting on the silken Buds Of breathing Violets; the Virgin's Sigh, Rosy with Youth, are turbulent and rude, To Sappho's Plaint, and Eloïsa's Moan. Heav'ns! what a Flood of empyréal Day My aking Eyes involves! A Temple of Fame. Temple soars, Rising like Exhalations, on a Mount, And, wide, its Adamantine Valves expands. Three monumental Columns, bright in Air, Of figur'd Gold, the Center of the Quire With Lustre fill. Pope on the Midmost shines Betwixt his Homer and his Horace plac'd, Superior by the Hand of Justice. Fame, With all her Mouths th' eternal Trumpet swells, Exulting at his Name; and, grateful, pours The lofty Notes of never-dying Praise, Triumphant, floating on the Wings of Wind, Sweet o'er the World: th' Ambrosial Spirit flies Diffusive, in its Progress wid'ning still, “Dear to the Earth, and grateful to the Sky.” Fame owes Him more than e'er she can repay: She owes her very Temple to his Hands; Like Ilium built; by Hands no less divine! Attention, rouze thyself! the Master's Hand, (The Master of our Souls!) has chang'd the Key, And bids the Thunder of the Battle roar Tumultuous Translation of Homer.. Homer, Homer is our own! And Grecian Heroes flame in British Lines. What Pomp of Words! what nameless Energy Kindles the Verse; invigours every Line; Astonishes, and overwhelms the Soul In Transport tost! When fierce Achilles raves, And flashes, like a Comet, o'er the Field, To wither Armies with his Martial Frown; I see the Battle rage; I hear the Wheels Careering with their brazen Orbs! The Shout Of Nations rolls (the Labour of the Winds)— Full on my Ear, and shakes my inmost Soul. Description never cou'd so well deceive: 'Tis real! Troy is here, or I at Troy Enjoy the War. My Spirits, all on Fire, With unextinguish'd Violence are born Above the World, and mingle with the Gods. Olympus rings with Arms! the Firmament, Beneath the Light'ning of Minerva's Shield, Burns to the Center: rock the Tow'rs of Heav'n. All Nature trembles! save the Throne of Jove!— Have Mercy, Pope, and kill me not with Joy: 'Tis tenfold Rage, an Agony of Bliss! Be less a God, nor force me to adore. Ethic Epistles.To root Excesses from the human-Breast, Behold a beauteous Pile of Ethicks rise; Sense, the Foundation; Harmony, the Walls; (The Dorique grave, and gay Corinthian join'd) Where Socrates and Horace jointly reign. Best of Philosophers! of Poets too The best! He teaches thee thyself to know: That Virtue is the noblest gift of Heav'n: “And vindicates the Ways of God to Man.” O hearken to the Moralist polite! Enter his School of Truth; where Plato's self Might preach; and Tully deign to lend an Ear. Dunciad.Last see him waging with the Fools of Rhyme A wanton, harmless War. Dunce after Dunce Beaux, Doctors, Templars, Courtiers, Sophs and Cits, Condemn'd to suffer Life. The motley Crew, Emerging from Oblivion's muddy Pool, Give the round Face to view, and shameless Front Proudly expose; till Laughter have her Fill. Born to improve the Age, and cheat Mankind Into the Road of Honour!—Vice again The gilded Chariot drives:—for He is dead! I saw the sable Barge, along his Thames, In slow Solemnity beating the Tide, Convey his sacred Dust!—Its Swans expir'd, Wither'd in Twit'nam Bow'rs the Laurel-Bough; Silent the Muses broke their idle Lyres: Th' attendant Graces check'd the sprightly Dance, Their Arms unlock'd, and catch'd the starting Tear, And Virtue for her lost Defender mourn'd! EPITAPH on my Francis Thompson B. D. Senr. Fellow of Queen's Coll. Oxford, and Vicar of Brough 32 Years. He departed this Life Aug. 31. 1735. Aged 70. FATHER. In the Parish Church of Brough, Westmoreland. Dear to the Wise and Good by All approv'd, The Joy of Virtue, and Heaven's well-belov'd! His Life inspir'd with every better Art, A learned Head, clear Soul, and honest Heart. Each Science chose his Breast her favourite Seat, Each Language, but the Language of Deceit. Severe his Virtues, yet his Manners kind, A manly Form, and a Seraphic Mind. So long he walk'd in Virtues even road, In him at length, 'twas natural to do good. Like The River Eden runs near Brough. Eden, his old Age (a Sabbath Rest!) Flow'd without Noise, yet all around him blest! His Patron, Jesus! with no Titles grac'd, But that best Title, a good Parish Priest. Peace with his Ashes dwell. And, Mortals, know, The Saint's above; the Dust alone below. The Wise and Good shall pay their Tribute here, The modest Tribute of one Thought and Tear, Then pensive Sigh, and say, “To me be given By living thus on Earth, to reign in Heaven.” EPITAPH on my She departed this Life October 25. 1737. Aged 65. MOTHER. In the Parish Church of Brough, Westmoreland. Here rests a Pattern of the Female Life, The Woman, Friend, the Mother, and the Wife. A Woman form'd by Nature, more than Art, With smiling Ease to gain upon the Heart. A Friend as true as Guardian-Angels are, Kindness her Law, Humanity her Care. A Mother sweetly tender, justly dear, Oh! never to be nam'd without a Tear. A Wife of every social Charm possest, Blessing her Her former Husband was Jos. Fisher M. A. Fellow of Queen's Coll. Oxford, Vicar of Brough and Arch-Deacon of Carlisle; by whom She had no Children. Husbands—In her Husbands blest. Love in her Heart, Compassion in her Eyes, Her Thoughts as humble, as her Virtues high. Her Knowledge useful, nor too high, nor low, To serve her Maker, and Her-self to know. Born to relieve the Poor, the Rich to please, To live with Honour, and to die in Peace. So full her Hope, her Wishes so resign'd, Her Life so blameless, so unstain'd her Mind, Heav'n smil'd to see, and gave the gracious Nod, Nor longer wou'd detain her from her God. Written in the HOLY BIBLE. Ye Sacred Tomes, be my unerring Guide, Dove-hearted Saints, and Prophets Eagle-ey'd! I scorn the Moral-Fop, and Ethic-Sage, But drink in Truth from your illumin'd Page: Like Moses-Bush each Leaf divinely bright, Where God invests Himself in milder Light! Taught by your Doctrines We devoutly rise, Faith points the Way, and Hope unbars the Skies. You tune our Passions, teach Them how to roll, And sink the Body but to raise the Soul; To raise It, bear It to Mysterious Day, Nor Want an Angel to direct the Way! On a PRESENT of THREE ROSES, from Ianthe. Three Roses to her humble Slave The Mistress of the Graces gave: Three Roses of an Eastern Hue, Sweet-swelling with ambrosial Dew. How each, with glowing Pride, displays The Riches of its circling Rays! How all, in sweet Abundance, shed Perfumes, that might revive the Dead! Now tell me, Fair One, if you know, Whence these balmy Spirits flow? Whence Springs this modest Blush of Light Which charms at once and pains the Sight? The Fair-One knew, but wou'd not say, So blush'd and smiling went her Way. Impatient, next the Muse I call; She comes, and thus wou'd answer all. “Fool, (and I sure deserv'd the Name) Mark well the Beauties of the Dame, And can you wonder why so fair, And why so sweet the Roses are? Her Cheek with living purple glows Which blush'd its Rays on every Rose; Her Breath exhal'd a sweeter Smell Than fragrant Fields of Asphodel; The sparkling Spirit in her Eyes A kindlier influence supplies Than genial Suns and Summer Skies. Now can you wonder why so fair, And why so sweet the Roses are?” “Hold, tuneful Trifler, I reply'd, The beauteous Cause I now descri'd, Hold, talk no more of Summer Skies, Of genial Suns and—splendid Lyes; Of fragrant Fields of Asphodel, And brightest Rays and sweetest Smell; Whatever Poetry can paint, Or Muse can utter—all is faint: Two Words had better all exprest;— “She took the Roses from—her Breast. CUPID MISTAKEN. I Venus whipt Cupid 'tother Day, For having lost his Bow and Quiver: For he had giv'n Them both away To Stella, Queen of Isis-River. II “Mamma! You wrong Me while You strike, (Cry's weeping Cupid) for I vow, Stella and You are so alike, I thought that I had lent Them You. Cupid in LOVE. Or Stella and the WASP. Anacreontick. Cupid by a Bee was stung, Lately; since Anacreon sung: Venus, with a smiling Eye, Laugh'd to hear him sob and sigh. Angry Cupid in Revenge, (Gods their Shapes at pleasure Change) In the Form of Wasp or Bee, Stella! fix'd his Sting in Thee: Stella! fairest of the Fair: Stella, Venus' dearest Care! In Revenge He dealt the Blow On her Favourite Below; In Revenge of smiling Eyes, Sweetest Emblems of the Skies! O my Finger! Stella cry'd: Wou'd for Stella I had dy'd! O my Finger! thrice She cry'd, Thrice for Stella I'd have dy'd! Stella! fairest of the Fair, Stella, Venus' dearest Care! Venus, red'ning, drop'd a Tear: —“Here, You Sirrah, Cupid, here! Dare You torture, like a Foe, Stella, my Belov'd below? Curst Revenge on smiling Eyes, Sweetest Emblems of the Skies!” Cupid, smit with Stella's Eye, Answer'd Venus with a Sigh, “Rather, Mamma, pity Me; —I am wounded more than She. ON Writing Laura's Name in the Snow. Thirsis and Damon. Thirsis. Why, Damon, write you Laura's Name In snowy Letters? prithee, say: Was it her Coldness to express, Or shew thy Love wou'd melt away? Or, rather, was it This? Because When She is nam'd you burn and glow, Therefore in Hopes to cool your Breast You writ the Charmer's Name in Snow? Damon, Thirsis, since Ink wou'd blot her Charms, In Snow I chose her Name to write; Since only Snow like her is pure, Is soft alone, alone is white. Perhaps the Air her Name may freeze, And every Letter grow a Gem; Fit Characters to blaze her Charms, And owe their Rays to Stella's Name. A Monarch for the precious Name Might then with half his Kingdom part, Despise the Jewels on his Crown, To wear my Laura near his Heart. Thirsis. In vain. Behold the Noontide Sun Dissolves it with his amorous Flame:— The liquid Syllables are lost: Now, Damon, where is Laura's Name? Damon. Too true: yet tho' her Name dissolves; The shining Drops shall not be lost: I'll drink Them as They weep away, And still her Name shall be my Toast. EPILOGUE to CATO. Spoken by a young Gentleman in the Character of Marcia. Before a private Audience. Critics affirm, a bookish, clownish Race, (I wish they durst affirm it to my Face) That Love in Tragedies has nought to do: Ladies, if so, what wou'd They make of You? Why, make You useless, nameless, harmless Things: How false their Doctrine, I appeal to—Kings; Appeal to Afric, Asia, Greece and Rome: And, faith, we need not go—so far from Home. For Us the Lover burns and bleeds and dies, I fancy We have Comets in our Eyes; And They, you know, are—Signs of Tragedies. Thanks to my Stars, or, rather, to my Face, Sempronius perish'd for that very Case. The boist'rous Wretch bawl'd out for Act 4th. Scene 2d. Peals of Thunder, Because He cou'd not force Me—to come under. Lard! how I tremble at the narrow Scape; Which of you wou'd not—tremble—at a Rape? Howe're that be, this Play will plainly prove, That Liberty is not so sweet as Love. Think, Ladies, think what Fancies fill'd my Head, To find the living Juba for the dead! Tho' much He suffer'd on my Father's side, I'll make him cry, e're long, “I'm satisfied!” For I shall prove a mighty—loving Bride. But now, to make an End of Female Speeches, I'll quit my Petticoats to—wear the Breeches. Runs out and comes in his Night Gown. We' have chang'd the Scene: For Gravity becomes A Tragedy, as Hearses sable Plumes. His Country's Father you have seen, to Night, Unfortunately great, and sternly right. Fair Liberty, by impious Power opprest, Found no Asylum but Her Cato's Breast: Thither, as to a Temple, She retir'd, And when He plung'd the Dagger She expir'd. If Liberty revive at Cato's Name, And British Bosoms catch the Roman Flame: If hoary Villains rouze your honest Ire, And Patriot-Youths with Love of Freedom fire, If Lucia's Grief your graceful Pity move, And Marcia teach the Virgins virtuous Love, You'll own, ev'n in this methodizing Age, The mildest School—of Morals is the Stage. To you, the polish'd Judges of our Cause, Whose Smiles are Honour, and whose Nods applause, Humble we bend: encourage Arts like these; For tho' the Actors fail'd—they strove to please. Perhaps, in Time, your Favours of this Night May warm Us like young Marcus self to fight, Like Cato to defend, like Addison to write. THE HAPPY LIFE. I A Book, a Friend, a Song, a Glass, A chaste, yet laughter-loving Lass, To Mortals various Joys impart, Inform the Sense, and warm the Heart. II Thrice happy they, who, careless, laid Beneath a kind-embow'ring Shade, With Rosy Wreaths their Temples crown, In Rosy Wine their Sorrows drown. III Mean while the Muses wake the Lyre, The Graces modest Mirth inspire, Good-natur'd Humour, harmless Wit; Well-temper'd Joys, nor grave, nor light. IV Let Sacred Venus with her Heir, And dear Ianthe too be there. Musick and Wine in Concert move With Beauty, and refining Love. V There Peace shall spread her Dove-like Wing, And bid her Olives round us spring. There Truth shall reign, a Sacred Guest! And Innocence, to crown the Rest. VI Begone, Ambition, Riches, Toys, And splendid Cares, and guilty Joys.— Give me a Book, a Friend, a Glass, And a chaste, laughter-loving Lass. THE WEDDING MORN. A Dream. 'Twas Morn: But Theron still his Pillow prest: (His Annabella's Charms improv'd his Rest.) An Angel Form, the Daughter of the Skies, Descending blest; or seem'd to bless his Eyes; White from her Breast a dazzling Vestment roll'd, With Stars bespangled and celestial Gold. She mov'd, and Odours, wide, the Circuit fill'd; She spake, and Honey from her Lips distill'd. “Behold, illustrious comes, to bless thy Arms, Thy Annabella, breathing Love and Charms! O melting Mildness, undissembled Truth! Fair Flow'r of Age, yet blushing Bloom of Youth! Fair without Art, without design admir'd, Prais'd by the Good, and by the Wise desir'd. By Art and Nature taught and form'd to please, With all the sweet Simplicity of Ease. In publick courteous—for no private End; At Home—a Servant; and Abroad—a Friend. Her gentle Manners, unaffected Grace, And animated Sweetness of her Face, Her faultless Form, by Decency refind, And bright, unsullied Sanctity of Mind, The Christian Graces breathing in her Breast, Her—Whole shall teach Thee to be more than Blest. 'Tis Virtues Rays that point her sparkling Eyes, Her Face is beauteous for her Soul is wise. As from the Sun refulgent Glories roll, Which feed the Starry Host and fire the Pole, So stream upon her Face the Beauties of her Soul. Tho' the Dove's languish melts upon her Eye, And her Cheeks mantle with the Eastern Sky, When Seventy on her Temples sheds its Snow, Dim grow her Eyes and Cheeks forget to glow, Good-Nature shall the purple Loss supply, Good-Sense shine brighter than the sparkling Eye: In beauteous Order round and round shall move, Love cool'd by Reason, Reason warm'd by Love. Receive Heav'ns kindest Blessing! And regard This Blessing as thy Virtue's best reward. When Beauty wakes her fairest Forms to charm, When Musick all her Powr's of Sound to warm, Her golden Floods when wanton Freedom rolls, And Plenty pours Herself into our Bowls; When with tumultuous Throbs our Pulses beat, And dubious Reason totters on her Seat, The Youth how steady, how resolv'd the Guide Which stems the full luxuriant, pleasing Tide! For These, and Virtues such as These is given Thy Annabella! O belov'd of Heav'n!— Hail Marriage! everlasting be thy Reign! The Chain of Being is thy golden Chain. From hence Mankind, a growing Race depend, Began with Nature, shall with Nature end. The Mists, which stain'd thy Lustre, break away, In Glory lessen, and refine to Day: No more the Jest of Wits, of Fools the Scorn, Which God made Sacred, and which Priests adorn. Ascend the Bed, while genial Nature pours Her balmy Blessings round and nectar-Show'rs. And lo! the Future opens on my Eyes, I see soft Budds, and smiling Flowr's arise: The Human Blossoms every charm display, Unfold their Sweets, and beautify the Day. The Father's Virtues in the Sons combine; The Mother's Graces in the Daughters shine. So where an Angel spreads his Dovelike Wing Young Lawrels sprout, and tender Myrtles spring; Sweet Dews descending consecrate the Ground, And opens a new Paradise around! I see!”—But here the Scenes which blaz'd behind Her Fancy dazzled, and dissolv'd His Mind. He woke: yet still He thinks He sees and Hears; Till real Sounds salute his ravish'd Ears: “—Arise! the Bride invites Thee to be blest?” He rose.—But Silence only speaks the Rest. AN HYMN TO MAY. —Nunc formosissimus Annus. Virgil. ARGUMENT. Subject propos'd. Invocation of May. Description of Her: Her Operations on Nature. Bounty recommended; in particular at this Season. Vernal Apostrophe. Love the ruling Passion in May. The Celebration of Venus her Birth-Day in this Month. Rural Retirement in Spring. Conclusion. I Ethereal Daughter of the lusty Spring, And sweet Favonius, ever-gentle May! Shall I, unblam'd, presume of Thee to sing, And with thy living Colours gild my Lay? Thy genial Spirit mantles in my Brain; My Numbers languish in a softer Vein: I pant, too emulous, to flow in Spenser's Strain. II Say, mild Aurora of the blooming Year, With Storms when Winter blackens Nature's Face; When whirling Winds the howling Forest tear, And shake the solid Mountains from their Base: Say, what refulgent Chambers of the Sky Veil thy beloved Glories from the Eye, For which the Nations pine, and Earth's fair Children die? III Where Castor and Pollux. Leda's Twins, forth from their Diamond-Tow'r, Alternate, o'er the Night their Beams divide; In Light embosom'd, happy, and secure From Winter-Rage, thou chusest to abide. Blest Residence! For, there, as Poets tell, The Gemini are supposed to preside over learned men. See Pontanus in his beautiful Poem call'd Urania. Lib. 2. De Geminis.The Power's of Poetry and Wisdom dwell; Apollo wakes the Arts; the Muses strike the Shell. IV Surely, certainly. Ibid. ? Rhedicyna, &amp;c. Oxford.Certes o'er Rhedicyna's laurel'd Mead, (For ever spread, ye Laurels, green and new!) The Brother-Stars their gracious Nurture shed, And secret Blessings of Poetic-Dew. They bathe their Horses in the learned Flood, With Flame recruited for th' æthereal Road; And deem fair Isis' Swans Jupiter deceiv'd Leda in the Shape of a Swan as She was bathing herself in the River Euretas. fair as their Father-God. V No sooner April, trim'd with Garlands. Girlands gay, Rains Fragrance o'er the World, and kindly Showrs; But, in the Eastern-Pride of Beauty, May, To gladden Earth, forsakes her heav'nly Bow'rs, Restoring Nature from her palsy'd State. April, retire; Nor. ne longer, Nature, wait: Soon may she issue from the Morning's golden Gate. VI Come, bounteous May! in Fulness of thy Might, Lead, briskly, on the mirth-infusing Hours, All-recent from the Bosom of Delight, With Nectar, nurtur'd; and involv'd in Flow'rs: By Spring's sweet Blush, by Nature's teeming Womb; By Hebe's dimply Smile, by Flora's Bloom; By Venus'-self (for Venus'-self demands thee) come! VII By the warm Sighs, in dewy Even-Tide, Of melting Maidens, in the Wood-bind-groves, To Pity loosen'd, soften'd down from Pride; By billing Turtles, and by cooing Doves; By the Youth's Plainings stealing on the Air, (For Youths will plain, tho' yielding be the Fair) Hither, to bless the Maidens and the Youths, repair. VIII With Dew bespangled, by the Hawthorn-buds, With Freshness breathing, by the daisy'd Plains, By the mix'd Music of the warbling Woods, And jovial Songs. Roundelays of Nymphs and Swains; In thy full Energy, and rich Array, Delight of Earth and Heav'n! O blessed May! From Heav'n descend to Earth: on Earth vouchsafe to stay. IX She comes!—A silken A light Gown. Camus, emral'd-green, Gracefully loose, adown her Shoulder's flows, (Fit to enfold the Limbs of Paphos' Queen) And with the Labours of the Needle glows, Flowrish'd with a Needle.Purfled by Nature's Hand! The amorous Air And musky-western Breezes, fast, repair, Her Mantle proud to swell, and wanton with her Hair. X Her Hair (but rather Threads of Light it seems) With the gay Honours of the Spring intwin'd, Copious, unbound, in nectar'd Ringlets streams, Floats glitt'ring on the Sun, and scents the Wind, Love-sick with Odours!—Now to order roll'd, It melts upon her Bosom's dainty Mould, Or, curling round her Waste, disparts its wavy Gold. XI Young-circling Roses, blushing, round them throw The sweet Abundance of their purple Rays, And Lillies, dip'd in Fragrance, freshly blow, With blended Beauties, in her Angel-Face. The humid Radiance beaming from her Eyes The Air and Seas illumes, the Earth and Skies; And open, where she smiles, the Sweets of Paradise. XII On Zephyr's Wing the laughing Goddess view, Distilling Balm. She cleaves the buxom Air, Attended by the silver-footed Dew, The Ravages of Winter to repair. She gives her naked Bosom to the Gales, Her naked Bosom down the Æther Sails; Her Bosom breaths Delight; her Breath the Spring exhales. XIII All as the Phenix, in Arabian Skies, New-burnish'd from his spicy Funeral Pyres, At large, in Pliny tells us. Lib. 11. That the Phenix is about the Bigness of an Eagle: The Feathers round the Neck shining like Gold, the Body of a purple Colour, the Tail blue with Feathers resembling Roses. See Claudian's fine Poem on that Subject and Marcellus Donatus, who has a short Dissertation on the Phenix in his Observations on Tacitus. Annal. Lib. 6. Westley on Job, and Sr. Tho. Brown's Vulgar Errors. roseal Undulation, flies; His Plumage dazzles and the Gazer tires: Around their King the plumy Nations wait, Attend his Triumph, and augment his State: He tow'ring, claps his Wings, and wins th' Æthereal Height. XIV So round this Phenix of the gawdy Year A thousand, nay ten thousand Sports and Smiles, Fluttering in Gold, along the Hemisphere, Her Praises chaunt; her Praises Glad the Isles. Conscious of her approach (to deck her Bow'rs) Earth from her fruitful Lap and Bosom pours A waste of springing Sweets, and voluntary Flow'rs. XV A beautiful Youth who, beholding his Face in a Fountain, fell in Love with himself, and pining away was chang'd into a Flow'r which bears his Name. See Ovid. Metamorph. Lib. 3. Narcissus fair, in snowy Velvet gown'd; Ah foolish! still to love the Fountain-brim: Belov'd and turned into a Flow'r by Apollo. See the Story in Ovid. Met. Lib. 10. There is likewise a curious Dialogue in Lucian betwixt Mercury and Apollo on this Subject. Servius in his Notes on Virgil's second Bucolick takes the Hyacinth to be the Vaccinium of the Latines, bearing some Similitude with the Name.Sweet Hyacinth, by Phebus Formerly: long ago. erst bemoan'd; And Tulip, flaring in her powder'd Trim. Whate're, See Tasso's Il Goffredo. Canto 16. Armida, in thy Gardens blew; Whate're the Sun inhales, or sips the Dew; Whate're compose the Chaplet on Ianthes' Brow. XVI He who Undazzled. undaz'd can wander o'er her Face, May gain upon the Solar-blaze at Noon!— What more than female Sweetness, and a Grace Peculiar! save, Ianthe, thine alone, Ineffable Effusion of the Day! So very much the same, that Lovers say, May is Ianthe; or the dear Ianthe, May. XVII So far as doth the Harbinger of Day The lesser Lamps of Night in Brightness. Shining. Sheen excell; So far in Sweetness and in Beauty May Above all other Months doth bear the Bell. So far as May doth other Months exceed, So far in Virtue and in Beauty. Goodlihead, Above all other Nymphs Ianthe bears the Prize. Meed. XVIII Welcome! as to a youthful Poet, Wine, To fire his Fancy, and enlarge his Soul: He weaves the Laurel-Chaplet with the Vine, And grows Immortal as he drains the Bowl. Welcome! as Beauty to the lovesick Swain, For which he long had sigh'd, but sigh'd in Vain; He darts into her Arms; quick-vanishes his Pain. XIX The drowzy Elements, arouz'd by thee, Roll to harmonious Measures, active all! Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, with feeling Glee, Exult to celebrate thy Festival. Fire Glows intenser; softer, blows the Air; More smooth the Waters flow; Earth smiles more fair: Earth, Water, Air and Fire, thy gladning impulse Share. XX What boundless Tides of Splendor o'er the Skies, O'erflowing Brightness! stream their golden Rays! Heav'ns Azure kindles with the varying Dies, Reflects the Glory, and returns the Blaze. Air whitens; wide the Tracts of Æther been With Colours damask'd rich, and goodly Sheen, And all above, is blue; and all below is green. XXI At thy approach, the wild Waves' loud uproar, And foamy Surges of the mad'ning Main, Forget to heave their Mountains to the Shore; Diffus'd into the level of the Plain. For thee, the Halcyon builds her Summer's-nest; For thee, the Ocean smooths her troubled Breast, Gay from thy placid Smiles, in thy own purple Drest. XXII Have ye not seen, in gentle Even-tide, When Jupiter the Earth hath richly showr'd, Striding the Clouds, a Bow Spread. dispredden-wide As if with Light inwove, and gayly flowr'd With bright Variety of blending Dies? White, purple, yellow melt along the Skies, Alternate Colours sink, alternate Colours rise. XXIII The Earths embroidery then have ye ey'd, And smile of Blossoms, yellow, purple, white; Their vernal-tinctur'd Leaves, luxurious, died In Flora's Liv'ry, painted by the Light. Lights' painted Children in the Breezes play, Lay out their dewy Bosoms to the Ray, Their soft Enamel spread, and beautify the Day. XXIV From the wide Altar of the foodful Earth The Flow'rs, the Herbs, the Plants, their Incense roll; The Orchards swell the Ruby-tinctur'd Birth; The Vermil-gardens breath the spicy Soul. Grateful to May, the Nectar-spirit flies, The wafted Clouds of lavish'd Odours rise, The Zephyr's balmy Burthen, worthy of the Skies. XXV The Bee, the golden Daughter of the Spring, From Mead to Mead, in wanton Labour, roves, And loads its little Thigh, or gilds its Wing With all the Essence of the flushing Groves: Extracts the aromatick Soul of Flow'rs, And, humming in Delight, its waxen Bow'rs Fills with the luscious Spoils, and lives Ambrosial-Hours. XXVI Touch'd by Thee, May, the Flocks and lusty Droves That low in Pastures, or on Mountains bleat, Revive their Frolicks and renew their Loves, Stung to the Marrow with a generous Heat. The stately Courser, bounding o'er the Plain, Shakes to the Winds the Honours of his Mane, (High-arch'd his Neck) and, snuffing, hopes the dappled Train. XXVII The aëreal Songsters sooth the list'ning Groves: The mellow Thrush, the Blackbird. Ouzle sweetly shrill, And little Linnet celebrate their Loves In Hawthorn Valley, or on tufted Hill; The soaring Lark, the lowly Nightingale, A Thorn her Pillow, trills her doleful Tale, And melancholy Musick dies along the Dale. XXVIII This gay Exuberance of gorgeous Spring, The gilded Mountain, and the herbag'd Vale, The Woods that blossom, and the Birds that sing, The murmuring Fountain and the breathing Dale: The Dale, the Fountains, Birds and Woods delight, The Vales, the Mountains and the Spring invite, Yet unadorn'd by May, no longer charm the Sight. XXIX When Nature laughs around, shall Man alone, Thy Image, hang (ah me!) the sickly Head? When Nature sings, shall Nature's Glory groan, And languish for the Pittance poor of Bread! O may the Man that shall his Image scorn, Alive, be ground with Hunger, most forlorn, Die Without a funeral Knell. unanell'd, and dead, by Dogs and Kites be torn. XXX Curs'd may He be (as if he were not so.) Nay doubly curs'd be such a Breast of Steel, Which never melted at Another's Woe, Nor Tenderness of Bowels knew to feel. His Heart is black as Hell, in flowing Store Who hears the Needy crying at his Door, Who hears Them cry, Nor is concern'd. ne recks; but suffers them be Poor. XXXI But blest, O more than doubly blest be He! Let Honour crown him and eternal Rest, Whose Bosom, the sweet Fount of Charity, Flows out to To nurse. noursle Innocence distrest. His Ear is open to the Widows cries, His Hand the Orphan's Cheek of Sorrow drys; Like Mercy's self he looks on Want with Pity's Eyes. XXXII In this blest Season, pregnant with Delight, Nor.Ne may the boading Owl with Screeches wound The solemn Silence of the quiet Night, Ne croaking Raven, with unhallow'd Sound, Ne damned Ghost Affright. affray with deadly Yell The waking Lover, rais'd by mighty Spell, To pale the Stars, till Hesper shine it back to Hell. XXXIII Ne Witches rifle Gibbets, by the Moon, (With Horror winking, trembling all with with Fear) Of many a clinking Chain, and canker'd Bone: Nor Imp in visionary Shape appear, To blast the thriving Verdure of the Plain; Ne let Hobgoblin, ne the Ponk, profane With shadowy Glare the Light, and mad the bursting Brain. XXXIV Yet Fairy-Elves (so The Lemuria, or Rites sacred to the Lemures, were celebrated by the Romans in May. See Ovid. Fast. 1. 5. &amp;c. They imagined the Lemures (in English, Fairies) to be like Ghosts of deceased Persons: but our traditional Accounts are very different in Respect to the Nature of Fairies. Shake-spear's Midsummers Night's Dream, Drayton's Fairy Tale, and a celebrated Old Ballad, are Master-pieces in their Kind. ancient Custom's will) The green-gown'd Fairy Elves, by starry Brightness. Sheen, May gambol or in Valley or on Hill, And leave their Footsteps on the circled Green. Full lightly trip it, dapper Mab, around; Full Nimbly. featly, Ob'ron, Thou, o'er Grass-turf bound: Mab brushes off no Dew-drops, Ob'ron prints no ground. XXXV Nor.Ne bloody Rumours violate the Ear, Of City's sack'd, and Kingdoms desolate, With Plague or Sword, with pestilence or War; Ne rueful Murder stain thy æra-date; Ne shameless Calumny, for fell Despight, The foulest Fiend that e'er blasphem'd the Light, At lovely Lady rail, nor grin at courteous Knight. XXXVI Ne Wailing in our Streets nor Fields be heard, Ne Voice of Misery assault the Heart; Ne Fatherless from Table be debar'd; Ne piteous Tear from Eye of Sorrow start; But Plenty, pour thy self into the Bowl Of Bounty-head; may never Want controul That Good, Good-Honest Man, who feeds the famish'd Soul. XXXVIII Now let the Trumpet's martial Thunders sleep; The Viol wake alone, and tender Flute: The Phrygian Lyre with sprightly Fingers sweep, And, Erato, dissolve the Lydian-lute. Yet Clio frets, and burns, with honest Pain, To rouze and animate the martial Strain, While British Banners flame o'er many a purpled Plain. XXXVIII The Trumpet sleeps, but soon for Thee shall wake, Illustrious Chief! to sound thy mighty Name, (Snatch'd from the Malice of Lethean-lake) Triumphant-swelling from the Mouth of Fame. Mean while, disdain not (so the Virgins pray) This Rosy-Crown, with Myrtle wove and Bay; (Too humble Crown I ween:) the Offering of May. XXXIX And while the Virgins hail Thee with their Voice, Heaping thy crowded Way with Greens and Flow'rs, And in the Fondness of their Heart rejoice To sooth, with Dance and Song, thy gentler Hours; Indulge the Season, and with sweet Repair Embay thy Limbs, the vernal Beauties share: Then blaze in Arms again, renew'd for future War. XL Britannia's happy Isle derives from May The choicest Blessings Liberty bestows: When Royal Charles (for ever hail the Day!) In Mercy triumph'd o'er ignoble Foes. Restor'd with him, the Arts the drooping Head Gayly again uprear'd; the Muses Shade With fresher Honours bloom'd, in greener Trim array'd. XLI And Thou, the goodliest Blossom of our Isles! Great Frederick's and His Augusta's Joy, Thy native Month approv'd with Infant-smiles, Sweet as the smiling May, Imperial Boy! Britannia hopes Thee for her future Lord, Lov'd as thy Parents, only not ador'd! Whene're a George is born, Charles is again Restor'd. XLII O may his Father's Pant for finer Fame, And boundless Bountyhead to Humankind; His Grandsires Glory, and his Uncles Name, Renown'd in War! inflame his ardent Mind: So Arts shall flourish 'neath His equal Sway, So Arms the Hostile Nations wide affray; The Laurel, Victory; Apollo, wear the Bay. XLIII Through kind Infusion of celestial Pow'r, The dullard-Earth May quick'neth with Delight: Full suddenly the Seeds of Joy Recover. recure Elastick Spring, and Force within Placed, fixed. empight. If senseless Elements invigorate prove By genial May, and heavy Matter move, Shall Shepherdesses cease, shall Shepherds fail to love? XLIV Ye Shepherdesses, in a goodly Round, Purpled with Health, as in the Greenwood-Shade, Incontinent ye thump the echoing Ground And Finely. defftly lead the Dance along the Glade; (O may no Show'rs your Merry-makes affray!) Hail at the op'ning, at the closing Day, All hail, ye Pretty Women. Bonnibels, to your own Season, May. XLIV Nor ye absent yourselves, ye Shepherd-Swains, But lend to Dance and Song the liberal May, And while in jocund Ranks you beat the Plains, Your Flocks shall nibble and your Lambkins play, Frisking in Glee. To May your Girlands bring, And ever and anon her Praises sing: The Woods shall echo May, with May the Vallies ring. XLV Your May-pole deck with flow'ry Coronal; Sprinkle the flow'ry Coronal with Wine; And in the nimble-footed Galliard, all, Shepherds and Shepherdesses, lively, join. Hither from Village sweet and Hamlet fair, From bordering Cot and distant A Country Hamlet. Glenne repair: Let Youth indulge its Sport, to Old Age. Eld bequeath its Care. XLVI Ye wanton Dryads and light-tripping Fawns, Ye jolly Satyrs, full of Vigour. Lustyhead, And ye that haunt the Hills, the Brooks, the Lawns; O come with rural Chaplets gay dispread: With Heel so nimble wear the springing Grass, To shrilling Bagpipe, or to tinkling Brass; Or foot it to the Reed: Pan pipes himself apace. XLVII In this soft Season, when Creation smil'd, A quivering Splendor on the Ocean hung, And from the fruitful Froth, his fairest Child, The Queen of Bliss and Beauty, Venus sprung. The Dolphins gambol o'er the wat'ry Way, Carrol the Naids, while the Triton's play, And all the sea-green Sisters bless the Holy-day. XLVIII In Honour of her natal-Month the Queen Of Bliss and Beauty, consecrates her Hours, Fresh as her Cheek, and as her Brow serene, To buxom Ladies, and their Paramours. Love tips with golden Alchimy his Dart; With rapt'rous Anguish, with an honey'd Smart Eye languishes on Eye, and Heart dissolves on Heart. XLIX A softly-swelling Hill, with Myrtles crown'd, (Myrtles to Venus Ever. Algates sacred been) Hight Acidale, the fairest Spot on Ground, For ever fragrant and for ever green, O'erlooks the Windings of a shady Vale, By Beauty form'd for amorous Regale. Was ever Hill so sweet, as sweetest Acidale? L All down the Sides, the Sides profuse of Flow'rs, An hundred Rills, in shining Mazes, flow Through mossy Grotto's Amaranthine Bow'rs, And form a laughing Flood in Vale below: Where oft their Limbs the Loves and Graces Bathe. bay (When Summer sheds insufferable Day) And sport, and dive, and flounce in Wantonness of Play. LI No Noise o'ercomes the Silence of the Shades, Save short-breath'd Vows, the dear Excess of Joy; Or harmless Giggle of the Youths and Maids, Who yield Obeysance to the Cyprian Boy: Or Lute, soft-sighing in the passing Gale; Or Fountain, gurgling down the sacred Vale, Or Hymn to Beauty's Queen, or Lover's tender Tale. LII Here Venus revels, here maintains her Court In light Festivity and gladsome Game: The Young and Gay, in frolick Troops resort, Withouten Censure and withouten Blame. In Pleasure steep'd, and dancing in Delight, Night steals upon the Day, the Day, on Night: Each Knight, his Lady loves; each Lady loves her Knight. LIII Where lives the Man (if such a Man there be) In idle Wilderness or Desart drear, To Beauty's sacred Pow'r an Enemy? Let foul Fiends Destroy. harrow him; I'll drop no Tear. I deem that A Clown. Carl, by Beauty's Pow'r unmov'd, Hated of Heav'n, of none but Hell approv'd. O may he never love, O never be belov'd! LIV Hard is his Heart, unmelted by Thee, May! Unconscious of Love's nectar-tickling Sting, And, unrelenting, cold to Beauty's Ray; Beauty the Mother and the Child of Spring! Beauty and Wit declare the Sexes even; Beauty, to Woman, Wit to Man is given; Neither the Slime of Earth, but each the Fire of Heav'n. LV Alliance sweet! let Beauty, Wit approve, As Flow'rs to Sunshine ope the ready Breast: Wit Beauty Loves, and nothing else can love: The best alone is grateful to the best. Perfection has no other Parallel! Can Light, with Darkness; Doves with Ravens dwell? As soon, An old Word for asserting any Thing. perdie, shall Heav'n Communion hold with Hell. LVI I sing to you, who love alone for Love: For Gold the beauteous Fools (O Fools besure!) Can win; tho' brighter Wit shall never move: But Folly is to Wit the certain Cure. Curs'd be the Men, (or be they young or old) Curs'd be the Women, who themselves have sold To the detested Bed for Lucre base of Gold. LVII Not Julia such: she higher Honour deem'd To languish in the Sulmo-Poet's Arms, Than, by the Potentates of Earth esteem'd, To give to Scepters and to Crowns her Charms. Not Laura such: in sweet Vauclusa's Vale She list'ned to her Petrarch's amorous Tale. But did poor Spenser. Colin Clout o'er Rosalind prevail? LVIII Howe'er that be; in These three celebrated Poets and Lovers were all of them unhappy in their Amours. Ovid was banish'd on Account of his Passion for Julia. Death deprived Petrarch of his beloved Laura very early; as he himself tells us in his Account of his own Life: These are his Words. Amore acerrimo, sed unico &amp; honesto, in Adolescentia laboravi, &amp; diutius laborassem, nisi jam tepescentem ignem mors acerba, sed utilis, extinxisset. See his Works, Basil, Fol. Tom. 1. Yet others say, she married another Person; which is scarce probable; since Petrarch lamented her Death for ten Years afterwards, as appears from Sonetto 313, with a most uncommon Ardour of Passion. Thomasinus in his curious Book, called Petrarcha Redivivus, has given us two Prints of Laura, with an Account of her Family, their Loves, and his sweet Retirement in Vavcluse. As for Spenser, we may conclude that his Love for Rosalinda proved unsuccessful from his pathetical Complaints, in several of his Poems, of her Cruelty. The Author, therefore, thought it only a poetical Kind of Justice to reward them in this imaginary Retreat of Lovers, for the Misfortunes they really suffer'd here, on Account of their Passion. Acidalian Shade, Embracing Julia, Ovid melts the Day: No Dreams of Banishment his Loves invade; Encircled in Eternity of May. Here Petrarch with his Laura, soft reclin'd On Violets, gives Sorrow to the Wind: And Colin Clout pipes to the yielding Rosalind. LIX Pipe on, thou sweetest of the th' Arcadian-Train, That e'er with tuneful Breath inform'd the Quill: Pipe on, of Lovers the most loving Swain! Of Bliss and Melody O take thy Fill. Ne envy I, if dear Ianthe smile, Tho' low my Numbers, and tho' rude my Stile; Ne quit for Acidale, fair Albion's happy Isle. LX Come then, Ianthe! milder than the Spring, And grateful as the rosy Mouth of May, O come; the Birds the Hymn of Nature sing, Inchanting-wild, from every Bush and Spray: Swell the green Gemms and teem along the Vine, A fragrant Promise of the future Wine, The Spirits to exalt, the Genius to refine! LXI Let us our Steps direct where Father-Thames. In silver Windings draws his humid Train, And pours, where'er he rolls his Naval-stream, Pomp on the City, Plenty o'er the Plain. Or by the Banks of Isis shall we stray, (Ah why so long from Isis Banks away!) Where thousand Damsels dance, and thousand Shepherds play. LXII Or chuse you rather Theron's calm Retreat, Embosom'd, Surry, in thy verdant Vale, At once the Muses and the Graces Seat! There gently listen to my faithful Tale. Along the dew-bright Parterres let us rove, Or taste the Odours of the Mazy-Grove: Hark how the Turtles coo: I languish too with Love. LXIII Amid the Pleasaunce of Arcadian Scenes, Love steals his silent Arrows on my Breast; Nor Falls of Water, nor enamel'd Greens, Can sooth my Anguish, or invite to Rest. You, dear Ianthe, you alone impart Balm to my Wounds, and Cordial to my Smart: The Apple of my Eye, the Life-blood of my Heart. LXIV With Line of Silk, with Hook of barbed Steel, Beneath this Oaken Umbrage let us lay, And from the Water's Crystal-bosom steal Upon the grassy Bank the finny Prey: The Perch, with Purple speckled manifold; The Eel, in silver Labyrinth self-roll'd, And Carp, all-burnish'd o'er with Drops of scaly Gold. LXV Or shall the Meads invite, with Iris-hues And Nature's Pencil gay-diversify'd, (For now the Sun has lick'd away the Dews) Fair-flushing and bedeck'd like Virgin-bride? Thither, (for they invite us) we'll repair, Collect and weave (whate'er is sweet and fair) A Posy for thy Breast, a Garland for thy Hair. XLVI Fair is the Lilly, clad in balmy Snow; Sweet is the Rose, of Spring the smiling Eye; Nipt by the Winds, their Heads the Lillies bow; Cropt by the Hand, the Roses fade and dye. Tho' now in Pride of Youth and Beauty drest, O think, Ianthe, cruel Time lays waste The Roses of the Cheek, the Lillies of the Breast. LXVII Weep not; but, rather taught by this, improve The present Freshness of thy springing Prime: Bestow thy Graces on the God of Love, Too precious for the wither'd Arms of Time. In chaste Endearments, innocently gay, Ianthe! now, now love thy Spring away; Ere cold October-blasts despoil the Bloom of May. LXVIII Now up the Chalky Mazes of yon Hill, With grateful Diligence, we wind our Way; What op'ning Scenes our ravish'd Senses fill, And, wide, their rural Luxury display! Woods, Dales, and Flocks, and Herds, and Cots and Spires, Villa's of learned Clerks, and gentle Squires; The Villa of a Friend the Eye-sight never tires. LXIX If er'e to Thee and Venus, May, I strung The gladsome Lyre, when Liveliness. Livelood swell'd my Veins, And Eden's Nymphs and Isis Damsels sung In tender Stella; five Amores: Elegiarum Tres Libri. Written in the Year 1736. Elegy, and Six Pastorals: written in the Year 1734. Pastoral-strains; Collect and shed thyself on Theron's Bowr's, O green his Gardens, O perfume his Flow'rs, O bless his Morning-walks and sooth his Ev'ning-hours. LXX Long, Theron, with thy Annabell enjoy The Walks of Nature, still to Virtue kind, For sacred solitude can never cloy; The Wisdom of an uncorrupted Mind! O very long may Hymen's golden Chain To Earth confine you and the Rural-reign; Then soar, at length, to Heaven! nor pray, O Muse, in vain. LXXI Wherer'e the Muses haunt, or Poets muse, In solitary Silence sweetly tir'd, Unloose thy Bosom, May! thy Stores effuse, Thy vernal Stores, by Poets most desir'd, Of living Fountain, of the Wood-bind-shade, Of Philomela, warbling from the Glade. Thy Bounty, in his Verse, shall certes be repay'd. LXXII On Twit'nam-Bow'rs (Aonian-Twit'nam-Bow'rs!) Thy softest Plenitude of Beauties shed, Thick as the Winter-Stars, or Summer-Flow'rs; Altho'.Albè the tuneful Master (ah!) be dead. To Colin next He taught my Youth to sing, My Reed to warble, to resound my String: The King of Shepherd's He, of Poet's He the King. LXXIII Hail, happy Scenes, where Joy wou'd chuse to dwell; Hail, golden Days, which Saturn deems his own; Hail Musick, which the Muses Scarcely. scant excell; Hail Flowrets, not unworthy Venus'-crown. Ye Linnets, Larks, ye Thrushes, Nightingales; Ye Hills, ye Plains, ye Groves, ye Streams, ye Gales, Ye ever-happy Scenes! all you, your Poet hails. LXXIV All-hail to thee, O May! the Crown of all! The Recompence and Glory of my Song: Ne small the Recompence, ne Glory small, If gentle Ladies, and the Tuneful-Throng, With Lovers-Myrtle, and with Poet's-Bay Fairly Adorn'd. bedight, approve the simple Lay, And think on Thomalin whene'er they hail Thee, May! THE NEW LYRE. He lent me a MS. Discourse on these Words “Old Things are passed away and lo! all Things are become New. To a Friend. I I strung my Lyre, when Love appear'd, Demanding a light-wanton Lay: Christ! I began—the Trifler heard, And shook his Wings, and pass'd away. II The Strings rebellious to my Hand Refuse to charm: in vain I sue, The Strings are mute to my Demand— I broke the old, and form'd a new. III Christ! I began: the sacred Lyre Responsive swell'd with Notes divine, And warm'd Me with Seraphic-fire: Sweet Jesus, I am only Thine! IV O wake to Life this springing Grace, And water with thy heavenly Dew: Display the Glories of thy Face, My Spirit and my Heart renew! V Direct my Soul, direct my Hand:— O blessed Change! Thy Pow'r I feel: My Numbers flow at thy Command, My Strings with holy Raptures swell. VI And, You, whose pious Pains unfold Those Truths, receive this Tribute due; You once endur'd my Muse of Old, Nor scorn the Firstfruits of the New. End of Tome the First.</field>

While I touch The Ebon-instrument, of solemn Tone, Pluckt from the Cypress' melancholy Boughs, Thus Horace: Barbiton hic Paries habebit. Lib. iii. Ode 26. And, a greater than Horace in Lyric Poetry, the Royal Psalmist represents the same Image: As for our Harps we hanged them up, upon the Trees that are therein. Psalm cxxxvii. 2. Which, deepning, shade the House of Mourning, Groans And hollow Wailings, through the Damps of Night, Responsive wound the Ear. The sprightly Pow'rs Of Musical Inchantment wave their Wings, And seek the fragrant Groves and purple Fields, Where Pleasure rolls her honey-trickling Streams, Of blooming Health and laughter-dimpled Joy. Me other Scenes than laughing Joy, and Health High-blooming, purple-living Fields and Groves, Fragrant with Spring, invite. Too long the Muse, Ah! much too long, a Libertine, diffus'd On Pleasure's rosy Lap, has, idly, breath'd Love-sighing Elegies, and Pastoral-strains, The soft Seducers of our youthful Hours, Soothing away the Vigour of the Mind, And Energy of Virtue. But, farewel, Ye Myrtle Walks, ye lilly-mantled Meads Of Paphos, Paphos, a City of Cyprus; formerly dedicated to Venus. and the Fount of Acidale, Acidale, a Fountain in Orchomenus, a City of Bœotia, where the Graces were supposed to bathe themselves. The Geneology of the Graces is very diversly related. But Hesiod says, they were the Offspring of Jupiter and Eurynome. Theog. Where, oft, in Summer, Grecian Fables tell, The Daughters of Eurynome and Jove, Thalia and her Sister-Graces cool Their glowing Features, at the noontide Hour, Farewel!—But come, Urania, from thy Bow'rs Of everlasting Day; O condescend To lead thy Votary (with rapt'rous Zeal Adoring Nature's God, the great Three-One!) To Salem; where the Shepherd-Monarch wak'd The sacred Breath of Melody, and swell'd His Harp, to Angel's kindred Notes attun'd, With Music worthy Heaven! O bath my Breast, With Praises burning, in the Morning-Dews, Which sparkle, Sion, on thy holy Hill. The Prophets, Eagle-ey'd, celestial Maid, Those Poets of the Sky! were taught to chaunt The Glories of Messiah's Reign by thee: Kindled by thee, the Eastern-pages flame With Light'ning, and with Thunder shake the Soul; While, from the Whirlwind, God's all-glorious Voice Bursts on the tingling Ears of Job: The Book of Job is ascrib'd to various Authors, and amongst the rest to Moses. I am proud to observe that Dr. Young has strengthened this opinion in his Notes to his admirable Poem on Job. Most of the Arguments on each Side of the Question may be found in Pole's Synopsis Critic. in the Beginning of his Notes on the Book of Job; and in Mr. S. Weslay's curious Dissertation on the same Subject. the Writ Of Moses, meek in Spirit, but his Thoughts Lofty as Heav'n's blue Arch. My humble Hopes Aspire but to the Alpha of his Song; Where, roll'd in Ashes, digging for a Grave, More earnest than the Covetous for Gold Or hidden Treasures, crusted o'er with Boils, And roaring in the Bitterness of Soul, And Heart-sick Pain, the Man of Uz complains. Themes correspondent to thy Servant's Theme. I sing to you, ye Sons of Men! of Dust, Say rather: What is Man, who proudly lifts His Brow audacious, as confronting Heav'n, And tramples, with Disdain, his Mother-Earth, But moulded Clay? an animated Heap Of Dust, that shortly shall to Dust return? We dream of Shadows, when we talk of Life, ????? ???? ????????. Pind. Pith. Ode 8. Sophocles has much the same Thought in his Ajax; and, to dignify the Sentiment, he puts it into the Mouth of Ulysses: ??? ??? ???? ????? ????? ???? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ?????, ? ?????? ?????. The Scholiast observes, that he borrowed the Sentiment from Pindar. Of Pelops' Shoulder, The Poets feign that Tantalus served up his Son Pelops to the Table of the Gods: They re-united the Fragments, and formed his Shoulder, which was lost, of Ivory. Ovid. Met. Lib. vi. —Humeroque Pelops insignis eburno. Verg. Georg. iii. I shall add this beautiful Passage from Tibullus: ?Carmina ni sint, Ex humero Pelopis non nituisset ebur. Lib. i. Eleg. 4. of Pythagoras' Thigh, This is told with so much Humour by Mr. Addison in one of his finest Works, that I rather chuse to give an Authority from him, than any of the Ancients. “The next Man astonished the whole Table with his Appearance: He was slow, solemn and silent, in his Behaviour, and wore a raiment curiously wrought with Hieroglyphicks. As he came into the middle of the Room, he threw back the Skirt of it, and discover'd a golden Thigh. Socrates at the Sight of it declared against keeping Company with any who were not made of Flesh and Blood; and therefore desired Diogenes the Laertian to lead him to the Apartment allotted the fabulous Heroes, and Worthies of dubious Existence, &amp;c.” The Table of Fame, Tatler Vol. II.

Dr. Donne in his Satyrs has given him this Character: ?outlie either Jovius, or Surius, or both together. Sat. 4. and Ovid's Gods; Meer Tales to cheat our Children with to Rest; And, when the Tale is told, they sink to sleep, Death's Image! so inane is mortal-Man! Man's but a Vapour, toss'd by every Wind, The Child of Smoak, which in a Moment flies, And, sinking into nothing, disappears. Man's a brisk Bubble, floating on the Waves Of wide Eternity: He dances now Gay-gilded by the Sun (tho' empty, proud;) Phantastically fine! and now he drops In a broad Sheet of Waters deep involv'd And gives His Place to Others. O, ye Sons Of Vanity, remember, and be wise! Man is a Flow'r, which, in the Morning, fair As Day-Spring, swelling from its slender Stem, In Virgin-modesty, and sweet Reserve, Lays out its blushing Beauties to the Day, As Gideon's Fleece, full with the Dews of Heav'n. But if some ruder Gale, or nipping Wind, Disastrous, blow too hard, It, weeping, mourns In Robes of Darkness; it reclines its Head In languid Softness; withers every Grace; And, ere the Ev'ning-Star the West inflames, It falls into the Portion of those Weeds Which, with a careless Hand, we cast away— Ye thoughtless Fair-ones, moralize my Song! Thy Pulse beats Music; thou art high in Health; The rather tremble. When the least we fear, When Folly lulls us on her Couch of Down, And Wine and Lutes and Odours fill the Sense With their soft Affluence of bewitching Joys; When Years of Rapture in thy Fancy glow To entertain thy Youth; a sudden Burst Of Thunder from the smallest Cloud of Fate, Small as the Prophet's Hand, destroys, confounds, And lays thy visionary Hopes in Dust. By my Example taught, Examples teach Much more than Precepts, learn to know thy End. The Day was Valentine's: when Lover's Wounds Afresh begin to bleed, and Sighs to warm The chilly Rigour of relenting Skies: Sacred the Day to Innocence and Mirth, The Festival of Youth! in seeming Health (As Custom bids) I hail'd the Year's fair Morn, And with its earliest Purple braid my Brows, The Violet, or Primrose, breathing Sweets New to the Sense. Ianthe by my Side, Sickness being a Subject so disagreeable, in itself, to human Nature, it was thought necessary, as Fable is the Soul of Poetry, to relieve the Imagination with the following, and some other Episodes. For to describe the Anguish of a distemper without a mixture of some more pleasing incidents, would, no doubt, disgust every good-natur'd and tender Reader. More lovely than the Season! rais'd her Voice, Observant of His Rites, in festal Lays, And thus addrest the Patron of the Spring. “Hail, Valentine! at thy Approach benign, Profuse of Gems, the Bosom of the Earth Her fragrant Stores unfolds: the Fields rejoice, And, in the Infancy of Plenty, smile: The Vallies laugh and sing: the Woods, alive, Sprout into floating Verdure, to embow'r Those happy Lovers, who record thy Praise. Hail, Valentine! at thy Approach benign, Inhaling genial Raptures from the Sun, The plumy Nations swell the Song of Joy, Thy soaring Choiristers! The Lark, the Thrush, And all th' aerial People, from the Wren And Linnet to the Eagle, feel the Stings Of amorous Delight, and sing thy Praise. Hail, Valentine! at thy Approach benign, Quick o'er the soft'ning Soul the gentle Gales Of Spring, awaking Bliss, instinctive, move The ardent Youth to breath the sighs of Faith Into the Virgin's Heart; Who, sick of Love, With equal Fires, and Purity of Truth, Consenting, blushes while she chaunts thy Praise.” So sung Ianthe: to my Heart I prest Her spotless Sweetness: when, (with wonder, hear!) Tho' She shone smiling by, the torpid Pow'rs Of Heaviness weigh'd down my beamless Eyes, And press'd them into Night. The Dews of Death Hung, clammy, on my Forehead, like the Damps Of midnight Sepulchres; which, silent, op'd By weeping Widows, or by Friendship's Hand, Yawn hideous on the Moon, and blast the Stars With pestilential Reek. My Head is torn With Pangs insufferable, pulsive Starts, And pungent Aches, griding thro' the Brain, To Madness hurrying the tormented Sense, And hate of Being.—Poor Ianthe wept In Bitterness, and took me by the Hand Compassionately kind: “Alas! she cry'd, What sudden Change is this? (Again she wept.) Say, can Ianthe prove the Source of Pain To Thamalin? forbid it, gracious Heav'n!” No, beauteous Innocence! As soon the Rose Shall poison with its Balm; as soon the Dove Become a white Dissembler, and the Stream With lulling Murmurs, creeping thro' the Grove, Offend the Shepherd's Slumber—Scarce my Tongue These fault'ring Accents stammer'd, down I sink, And a lethargick Stupor steeps my Sense In dull Oblivion: till returning Pain, Too faithful Monitor! and dire Disease Bid me remember, Pleasure is a Dream, That Health has Eagle's Wings, nor tarries long. New Horrors rise. For in my pricking Veins I feel the forky Flame: the rapid Flood Of throbbing Life, excursive from the Laws Of sober Nature, and harmonious Health, Boils in tumultuary Eddies round Its bursting Channels. Parching Thirst, anon, Drinks up the vital Maze, as Simois dry, Or Zanthus, by the Arm-ignipotent, With a red Torrent of involving Flames Exhausted; when Achilles with their Floods Wag'd more than mortal War: the God of Fire Wide o'er the Waters pour'd th' inundant Blaze, The shrinking Waters to the bottom boil And hiss in Ruin. O! ye Rivers, roll Your cooling Crystal o'er my burning Breast, For Ætna rages here! Ye Snows, descend; Bind me in icy Chains, ye northern Winds, And mitigate the Furies of the Fire! Good Heav'n! what Hoards of unrepented Guilt Have drawn this Vengeance down, have rais'd this Fiend To lash me with his Flames? But, O, forgive My Rashness, that dares blame Thy just Decrees. It is Thy Rod: I kiss it with my Heart, As well as Lips: like Aaron's may it bloom With Fruits of Goodness: not, like Moses' turn A Serpent; or, to tempt me to accuse The kind Oppression of thy righteous Hand, Or, sting me to despair.—Affliction, hail! Thou School of Virtue! open wide thy Gates, Thy Gates of Ebony! Yet, O, correct Thy Servant, not with Judgment, not in Wrath, But with thy Mercy, Lord! thy Stripes will heal. Thus without Heresy, Afflictions prove A Purgatory; save us as by Fire: And purifying off the Dross of Sin, Like old Elijah's Chariot, rap the Soul, On Wings of Meditation, to the Skies. In Health we have no Time to visit Truth: Health's the Disease of Morals: few in Health Turn o'er the Volumes which will make us Wise. What are ye, now, ye tuneful Triflers! once The eager Solace of my easy Hours, Ye dear Deluders or of Greece or Rome, Anacreon, Horace, Virgil, Homer, what? The gay, the bright, the sober, the sublime? And ye of softer Strain, ye amorous Fools, Correctly indolent, and sweetly Vain, Tibullus, Ovid; and the Female-verse Of Her, who, plunging from Leucadia's Heights, Extinguish'd, with her Life, her hopeless Fires, Or rose a Swan, as love-struck Fancy deem'd. Who wou'd not, in these Hours of Wisdom, give A Vatican of Wits for one Saint Paul? Dare Tully with the golden Mouth of Greece, With Chrysostom in Rhet'rick-thunder join, Advent'rous, now? as soon the feeble Sound, Salmoneus, of thy brazen Bridge contends Salmoneus King of Elis, a province in the Peloponnesus. He was so arrogant as to affect being thought a God: for which End he built a Bridge of Brass, by driving over which in his Chariot, he endeavour'd to make himself be believ'd the Thunderer. But Jupiter, enrag'd at his Impiety, struck him dead with a real Thunderbolt. Vidi crudeles dantem Salmonea pœnas, Dum flammas Jovis &amp; sonitus imitatur Olympi— Demens qui nimbos, &amp; non imitabile fulmen Ære &amp; Cornipedum cursu imitar at equorum. Virg. Æn. Lib. 4. With Jove's æthereal Peal, and bursting Roar Fulminous, rending Earth, o'erturning Air, And shaking Heav'n. Or shall the pointed Pen Of Seneca was born at Corduba in Spain. Corduba, with hostile Labour bend Its Sentences obscure against the Force Of Hierom's noble Fire? as soon the Moon, With blunted Horn, dares pour her pallid Beam Against the boundless Majesty of Day, The Sun's refulgent Throne; when, high, in Noon He kindles up the Earth to Light and Joy. My best Instructor, Sickness, shuts the Eye From Vanity; she draws the Curtains round The Couch, nor gives Admittance to the World: But to Harpocrates consigns the Door, Harpocrates, the God of Silence amongst the Egyptians. Si quicquam tacite commissum est fido ab amico, Me unum esse invenies illorum jure sacratum, Corneli, &amp; factum esse puta Harpocratem. Catull. Hence Erasnus, Lib. Adag. tells us, that reddere Harpocratem is the same as mutum reddere. So Catullus in another Place: Patruum reddidit Harpocratem. Ovid describes him in the same Manner, without taking Notice of his Name, amongst the Attendants of Isis: Quique premit vocem, digitoque silentia suadet. Metam. Lib. ix. This Description intirely agrees with the several Medals and Statues of Harpocrates, which the learned Antiquary Gisb. Cuperus exhibits in his laborious Dissertation on that Subject, printed with Monumenta Antiqua. But upon another Account likewise, Harpocrates may justly be appointed to attend upon the Sick; for he is numbered amongst the salutary Gods, who assisted in extream Dangers: as appears from Artemidorus, Oneir. L. ii. C. 44. where, after having mentioned Serapis, Isis, Anubis, and Harpocrates, he goes on thus; Semper enim servatores crediti sunt hi dii, eorum qui per omnia exercitati sunt, &amp; ad extremum periculum pervenerunt, &amp;c. Kircher also, in his Oedip. Egyp. p. 2. vol. II. p. 315. amongst others to the same purpose, has these remarkable Words: Reverebantur Ægypti, præter cætera numina maximè Isin &amp; Orisin, ac Horum sive Harpocratem, tanquam Iatricos Genios. And, silent, whispers me, that “Life is vain.” If Life be vain on what shall Man depend? Depend on Virtue. Virtue is a Rock Which stands for ever; braves the frowning Flood, And rears its awful brow, direct, to Heaven. Tho' Virtue save not from the Grave, she gives Her Votaries to the Stars; she plucks the Sting From the grim King of Terrors; smooths the Bed Of Anguish, and bids Death, tho' dreadful, smile. Death smiles on Virtue: And his Visage, black, Yet comely seems. A Christian scorns the Bounds Where limited Creation said to Time, “Here I have End.” Rapt'rous, he looks beyond Or Time or Space; he Triumphs o'er decay; And fills Eternity: the next to God!

Yet tho' to human Sight invisible, If She, whom I implore, Urania deign, With Euphrasy With Euphrasy, Angl. Eyebright. This Herb was unknown to the Ancients; at least it is not mention'd by them.

Avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante Trita pede, &amp;c. unless by Thee, I ween, Father of Fancy, of descriptive Verse, And shadowy Beings, gentle Edmund, hight Spenser! The Date of our English Poetry may with great Justice begin with Spenser. It is true, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate were Masters of uncommon Beauties, considering the Age they lived in, and have described the Humours, Passions, &amp;c. with great Discernment. Yet none of them seem to have been half so well acquainted with the very Life and Being of Poetry, Invention, Painting, and Design, as Spenser. Chaucer was the best before him; but then he borrowed most of his Poems, either from the Ancients, or from Boccace, Petrarch, or the Provençal Writers, &amp;c. Thus his Troilus and Cressida, the largest of his Works, was taken from Lollius; and the Romaunt of the Rose, was translated from the French of John de Meun, an Englishman, who flourished in the Reign of Richard II. and so of the rest. As for those who follow'd him, such as Heywood, Scogan, Skelton, &amp;c. they seem to be wholly ignorant of either Numbers, Language, Propriety, or even decency itself. I must be understood to except the Earl of Surry, Sir Thomas Wiat, Sir Philip Sidney, several Pieces in the Mirror of Magistrates, and a few Parts of Mr. G. Gascoign's and Turbervill's Works. the Sweetest of the tuneful Throng, Or recent, or of Old. eld. Creative Bard, Thy Springs unlock, expand thy fairy Scenes, Thy unexhausted Stores of Fancy spread, And with thy Images inrich my Song. Come The present Dutchess of Somerset. Hertford! with the Muse, awhile, vouchsafe (The softer Virtues melting in thy Breast, The tender Graces glowing in thy Form) Vouchsafe, in all the Beauty of Distress, To take a silent Walk among the Tombs: There lend a Charm to Sorrow, smooth her Brow, And sparkle through her Tears, in shining Woe. As when the The Platonists suppose that Love, or the celestial Venus (of whom the Dove is likewise an Emblem) created the World out of Chaos. Dove, (Thy Emblem, matchless Dame! For Beauty, Innocence, and Truth are Thine) Spread all its Colours oe'r the boundless Deep, (Empyreal Radiance quivering round the Gloom) Chaos reform'd, and bade Distraction smile! Deep in a Desert-vale, a Palace frowns Sublimely mournful: to the Eye it seems The Mansion of Despair, or ancient Night. The Graces of the Season's never knew To shed their Bounty here, or smiling, bless, With hospitable Foot, its bleak Domain, Uncultivated. Nor the various Robe Of flushing Spring, with Purple gay, invests Its blighted Plains; nor Summer's radiant Hand Profusive, scatters o'er its baleful Fields The rich Abundance of her glorious Days; And golden Autumn here forgets to reign. Here only Hemlock, and whatever Weeds Medea gather'd, or Canidia brew'd, Medea, notorious for her Incantations in Ovid, &amp;c. as Canidia in Horace. Wet with Avernus' Waves, or Pontus yields, Pontus, Colchos, and Thessalia, well known for producing noxious and pois'nous Herbs and Plants.

But the Soil Refuses to embrace the kindly Seeds Of healing Vegetation, Sage, and Rue, Dittany, and Amello, blooming still In Virgil's rural Page. Est etiam flos in pratis cui nomen Amello Fecere agricolæ. Virg. Georg. Lib. vi. Besides there grows a Flow'r in marshy Ground, Its Name Amellus, easy to be found: A mighty Spring works in it's Root, and cleaves The sprouting Stalk, and shews itself in Leaves. The Flow'r itself is of a golden Hue, The Leaves inclining to a darker Blue, &amp;c. Addison's Works, Vol. I. 4to. The bitter Yew, The Church-yard's Shade! and Cypress' wither'd Arms In formidable Ranks surround its Courts With Umbrage dun; administring a Roof To Birds of ominous portent; the Bat, The Raven boding Death, the screaming Owl Of heavy Wing, while Serpents, rustling, hiss, And croaking Toads the odious Concert aid. The peevish East, the rheumy South, the North Pregnant with Storms, are all the Winds that blow: While, distant far, the pure Etesian-Gales, And Western-breezes fan the spicy Beds Of Araby the Blest, or shake their Balm O'er fair Britannia's Plains, and wake her Flow'rs. Eternal Damps, and deadly Humours, drawn In pois'nous Exhalations from the Deep, Conglomerated into solid Night, And Darkness, almost to be felt, forbid The Sun, with chearful Beams, to purge the Air, But roll their suffocating Horrors round Incessant, banishing the blooming Train Of Health, and Joy, for ever, from the Dome. In sad Magnificence the Palace rears Its mouldering Columns; from thy Quarries, Nile, Of sable Marble, and Egyptian Mines Embowel'd. Nor Corinthian Pillars, gay With foliag'd Capitals and figur'd Frize, Nor feminine Ionique, nor, tho' grave, The fluted Dorique, and the Tuscan plain, In just Proportions Rise: but Gothic, rude, Irreconcil'd in ruinous Design: Save in the Center, in Relievo high, And swelling emblematically bold, In Gold the Apple rose Milton's Paradise Lost, Book 1st., “whose mortal Taste “Brought Death into the World, and all our Woe.” Malignantly delighted, dire Disease Surveys the glittering Pest, and grimly smiles With hellish Glee. Beneath, totters her Throne, Of jarring Elements; Earth, Water, Fire; Where hot, and cold; and moist, and dry maintain Unnatural War. Shapeless her frightful Form, (A Chaos of distemper'd Limbs in one) Huge as Megæra, cruel as the Grave, Her Eyes, two Comets; and her Breath, a Storm. High in her wither'd Arms, she weilds her Rod, With Adders curl'd, and dropping Gore; and points To the dead Walls, besmear'd with cursed Tales Of Plagues red-spotted, of blue Pestilence, Walking in Darkness; Havock at their Heels; Lean Famine, gnawing in Despight her Arm: Whatever Egypt, Athens, or Messine, Constantinople, Troynovant, Marseils, Or Cairo felt, or Spagnolet cou'd paint. A famous Painter, eminent for drawing the Distresses and Agonies of human Nature. A sickly Taper, glimmering feeble Rays Across the Gloom, makes Horror visible, And punishes, while it informs, the Eye. A thousand and ten thousand monstrous Shapes Compose the Group; the execrable Crew Which Michael, in Vision strange, See Milton's Paradise Lost, B. xi. disclos'd To Adam, in the Lazar-house of woe; A Colony from Hell. The knotted Gout, The bloated Dropsy, and the racking Stone Rolling her Eyes in Anguish; Lepra foul, Strangling Angina; Ephialtick starts; Unnerv'd Paralysis; with moist Catarrhs; Pleuritis bending o'er its Side, in Pain; Vertigo; murderous Apoplexy, proud With the late Spoils of Clayton's honour'd Life: Sir William Clayton, Bart. died at Marden in Surrey, December the 28th, 1744. Clayton, the good, the courteous, the humane; Tenacious of his Purpose, and his Word Firm as the fabled Throne of Grecian Jove. Be just, O Memory! again recall Those Looks illumin'd by his honest Heart, That open Freedom, and that chearful ease, The bounteous Emanations of his Soul: His British Honour; Christian Charity; And mild Benevolence for Human-kind. From every Quarter, Lamentations loud, And Sighs resound, and rueful Peals of Groans Roll echoing round the vaulted Dens, and Screams Dolorous, wrested from the Heart of Pain, And brain-sick Agony. Around her Throne Six favourite Furies, next Herself accurst, Their dismal Mansions keep; in Order each, As most destructive. In the foremost Rank, Of polish'd Steel, with Armour blood-distain'd, Helmets and Spears, and Shields, and Coats of Mail, With Iron stiff, or Tin, or Brass, or Gold, Swells a triumphal Arch; beneath grim War Shakes her red Arm: for War is a Disease, The fellest of the fell! Why will Mankind, Why will they, when so many Plagues involve This habitable Globe, (the curse of Sin,) Invent new Desolations to cut off The Christian Race? At least in Christian Climes Let Olives shade your Mountains, and let Peace Stream her white Banner o'er us, blest from War, And Laurels only deck your Poet's Brows. Or, if the fiery Metal in your Blood, And thirst of Human-Life your Bosom sting, Too savage! let the Fury loose of War, And bid the Battle rage against the Breasts Of Asian Infidels: redeem the Tow'rs Where David sung, Tho' a Croisade may seem very romantick (and perhaps it is so) yet it has been applauded by the greatest Writers of different Ages; by Æneas Sylvius, by Bessarion, by Naugerius, &amp;c. who have each writ Orations upon that Subject. And here I cannot help observing, that Casimire and Jac. Baldè, the two most celebrated of the modern Lyric Poets, have writ several of their finest Odes to animate the Christian Princes to such a Design; and that Tasso has adorn'd the Expedition of Godfrey of Bulloign with the most beautiful and perfect Poem since the Æneis (for I prefer Milton to Virgil himself.) the Son of David bled; And warm new Tasso's with the Epic-flame. Right opposite to War a gorgeous Throne With Jewels flaming, and emboss'd with Gold, And various Sculpture, strike the wond'ring Eye With jovial Scenes (amid Destruction gay,) Of Instruments of Mirth, the Harp, the Lute, Of costly Viands, of delicious Wines, And flow'ry Wreaths to bind the careless Brow Of Youth, or Age; as Youth or Age demand The pleasing Ruin from th' Enchantress, vile Intemperance: than Circe subtler far, See Homer's Odyssey, Lib. 10. Only subdu'd by Wisdom; fairer far, Than young Armida, See Tasso's Il Godfredo, Canto iv. Stanz. 29, &amp;c. Canto xiv. Stanz. 68. Canto xvi. Stanz. 29. whose bewitching Charms Rinaldo fetter'd in her rosy Chains; Till, by Ubaldo held, his Diamond Shield Blaz'd on his Mind the Virtues of his Race, And, quick, dissolv'd her wanton Mists away. See, from her Throne, slow-moving, she extends A poison'd Gobblet! fly the beauteous Bane: The Adder's Tooth, the Tiger's hungry Fang Are harmless to her Smiles; her Smiles are Death. Beneath the foamy Lustre of the Bowl, Which sparkles Men to Madness, lurks a Snake Of mortal Sting: fly: if you taste the Wine, Machaon swears Machaon celebrated in Homer; but here used, in general, for any Physician. So Ovid: Firma valent per se, nullumque Machaona quærunt. And Martial: Quid tibi cum medicis? dimitte Machaonas omnes. that Moly cannot cure. Mercury is said to have presented Moly to Ulysses to preserve him from the Charms of Circe. Homer's Odyss. Lib. x. Thus while he spoke, the sovereign Plant he drew, Where on th' all-bearing Earth unmark'd it grew. And shew'd its Nature and its wondrous Pow'r; Black was the Root, but milky white the Flow'r: Moly the Name. Mr. Pope. Laudatissima herbarum est Homero, quam vocari a diis putat Moly, &amp; inventionem ejus Mercurio assignat, contraque summa veneficia demonstrat, &amp;c. Plinius, Lib. xxv. C. 4. Tho' innocent and fair her Looks, she holds A lawless Commerce with her Sister Pests, And doubly whets their Darts: away—and live. Next, in a low-brow'd Cave, a little Hell, A pensive Hag, moping in Darkness, sits Dolefully-sad: her Eyes (so deadly-dull!) Stare from their stonied Sockets, widely wild; For ever bent on rusty Knives, and Ropes; On Poigna'rds, Bowls of Poison, Daggers red With clotted Gore. A Raven by her Side Eternal Croaks; her only Mate Despair; Who, scowling in a Night of Clouds, presents A thousand burning Hells, and damned Souls, And Lakes of stormy Fire, to mad the Brain Moon-strucken. Melancholy is her Name; Britannia's bitter Bane. Thou gracious Pow'r, (Whose Judgments and whose Mercies who can tell!) With Bars of Steel, with Hills of Adamant Crush down the sooty Fiend; nor let her blast The sacred Light of Heav'n's all-cheering Face, Nor fright, from Albion's Isle, the Angel Hope. Fever the fourth: adust as Afric-Wilds, Chain'd to a Bed of burning Brass: her Eyes Like roving Meteors blaze, nor ever close Their wakeful Lids: she turns, but turns in vain, Through Nights of Misery. Attendant Thirst Grasps hard an empty Bowl, and shrivel'd strives To drench her parched Throat. Not louder Groans From Phalaris's Bull, Amongst several Instruments of Torment that Phalaris caused to be contrived, there was a Bull of Brass, in which People being cast, and a Fire plac'd under it, they bellowed like Oxen. Perillus the Artist, demanding a great Reward for his Invention, was put in it himself to try the first Experiment. Upon which Pliny makes this good-natur'd Reflection: Perillum nemo laudat, sæviorem Phalaride tyranno, qui taurum fecit, mugitus hominis pollicitus, igne subdito, &amp; primus eum expertus cruciatum justiore sævitia, &amp;c. Plinius, Lib. xxxiv. C. 8. as Fame reports, Tormented with distressful din the Air, And drew the tender Tear from Pity's Eye. Consumption near; a joyless, meagre Wight, Panting for Breath, and shrinking into Shade Eludes the Grasp: thin as th' embodied Air Which, erst, deceiv'd Ixion's void embrace, Ixion being invited to dine with Jupiter fell in love with Juno, and endeavour'd to debauch her, who acquainted her Husband. He to try Ixion form'd a Cloud into Juno's likeness, upon which he satisfy'd his Lust. Hygini Fab. Diodor. vi. &amp;c. Ambitious of a Goddess! scarce her Legs Feebly she drags, with wheezing Labour, on, And Motion slow: a willow Wand directs Her tottering Steps, and marks her for the Grave. The last, so turpid to the View, affrights Her Neighbour Hags. Happy Herself is blind, Or Madness wou'd ensue; so bloated-black, So loathsome to each Sense, the Sight or Smell, Such foul Corruption on this Side the Grave; Variola yclep'd; ragged, and rough, Her Couch perplex'd with Thorns.—What heavy Scenes Hang o'er My Heart to feel the Theme is Mine! But Providence commands; His Will be done! She rushes through my Blood; she burns along, And riots on my Life.—Have Mercy, Heav'n!— Variola, what art thou? whence proceeds This Virulence, which all, but We, escape; Thou nauseous Enemy to Human-kind: In Man, and Man alone, thy mystick Seeds, Quiet, and in their secret Windings hid, Lie unprolifick; till Infection rouze Her pois'nous Particles, of proper Size, Figure, and Measure, to exert their Pow'r Of Impregnation; Atoms subtle, barb'd, Infrangible, and active to destroy; By Geometrick or Mechanick Rules Yet undiscover'd: quick the Leaven runs, Destructive of the Solids, Spirits, Blood Of mortal Man, and agitates the whole In general Conflagration and Misrule. As when the flinty Seeds of Fire embrace Some fit Materials, Stubble, Furze, or Straw, The crackling Blaze ascends; the rapid Flood Of ruddy Flames, impetuous o'er its Prey, Rolls its broad Course, and half the Field devours. As Adders deaf to Beauty, Wit, and Youth, How many living Lyres, by Thee unstrung, E'er half their Tunes are ended, cease to charm Th' admiring World? So ceas'd the matchless Name, By Cowley honour'd, by Roscommon lov'd, Orinda: Mrs. K. Philips, stiled the matchless Orinda. See her Poems in Folio.

And He who Phedra sung, in buskin'd Pomp, Mad with incestuous Fires, ingenious Smith: Oxonia's Sons! And, O, our recent Grief! Shall Lord Beauchamp, only Son of the Earl of Hertford, died at Bolognia of the Small-pox, Sept. 11th, 1744, Aged 19. Beauchamp die, forgotten by the Muse, Or are the Muses with their Hertford dumb! Where are Ye? weeping o'er thy learned Rhine, Bononia, fatal to our Hopes! Bolognia a City in Italy, the first School of the Lombard Painters, and a famous University, —Parvique Bononia Rheni. Silius Ital. Lib. viii. or else By Kennet's chalky Wave, with Tresses torn, Or rude, and wildly floating to the Winds, Mute, on the hoary Willows hang the Lyre, Neglected? or in rural Percy-lodge, Where Innocence and He walk'd Hand in Hand, The Cypress crop, or weave the Laurel-bough To grace his honour'd Grave? Ye Lillies, rise Immaculate; ye Roses, sweet as Morn; Less sweet and less immaculate than He. His op'ning Flow'r of Beauty softly smil'd, And, sparkling in the liquid Dews of Youth, Adorn'd the blessed Light! with Blossoms fair, Untainted; in the rank Italian Soil From Blemish pure. The Virgins stole a sigh, The Matrons lifted up their wond'ring Eyes, And blest the English-Angel as he pass'd, At Bolognia he went by the Name of L'Angelo Inglese. The same Compliment seems to have been paid by that People to our great Milton in his Travels, as we learn by this Epigram of a learned Italian Nobleman in the 2d Volume of Milton's poetical Works: Ut mens, forma, decor, facies, mos, si pietas sic, Non Anglus, verum herc'le Angelus, Ipse, fores. Rejoicing in his Rays! Why did we trust A Plant so lovely to their envious Skies, Unmercifully bright with savage Beams? His were the Arts of Italy before, Courting, and courted by the classic Muse. He travel'd not to learn, but to reform, And with his fair Example mend Mankind. Why need I name (for distant Nations know, Hesperia knows; O would Hesperia sing! As Maro, erst, and, late, Marino rais'd The blooming Beauchamps of the former Times, Marcellus, and Adonis to the Stars, On Wings of soaring Fire! so wou'd She sing!) His uncorrupted Heart; his Honour clear As Summer-suns, effulging forth his Soul In every Word and Look: his Reason's Ray By Folly, Vanity, or Vice unstain'd, Shining at once with Purity and Strength, With English Honesty, and Attick Fire: His Tenderness of Spirit, high-inform'd With wide Benevolence, and candid Zeal For Learning, Liberty, Religion, Truth: The Patriot-glories burning in his Breast, His King's and Country's undivided Friend! Each publick Virtue, and each private Grace; The Seymour Dignity, the Percy-flame; All, all!—Ere twenty Autumns roll'd away Their golden Plenty. Further still! behold His animated Bloom; his flush of Health; The Blood exulting with the balmy Tide Of vernal Life! so fresh for Pleasure form'd By Nature and the Graces: yet his Youth So temperately warm, so chastly cool, Ev'n Seraphims might look into his Mind, Might look, nor turn away their holy Eyes! Th' unutterable Essence of Good Heav'n, That Breath of God, that Energy divine Which gives us to be wise, and just, and pure, Full on his Bosom pour'd the living Stream, Illum'd, inspir'd and sanctify'd his Soul! And are these Wonders vanish'd? are those Eyes, Where ardent Truth, and melting Mildness shone, Clos'd in a foreign Land? no more to bless A Father, Mother, Friend! no more to charm A longing People? O, lamented Youth! Heu miserande Puer, siqua fata aspera rumpas, Tu Marcellus eris— Sed nox atra caput tristi circumvolat umbra. Virg. Æn. Lib. vi. Since Fate and gloomy Night thy Beauties veil'd With Shade mysterious, and eclips'd thy Beams, How many Somersets are lost in Thee! Yet only lost to Earth!—For trust the Muse, (His Virtues rather trust) She saw him rise She saw him smile along the tissu'd Clouds, In Colours rich-embroider'd by the Sun, Engirt with Cherub-wings, and Kindred-forms, Children of Light, the spotless Youth of Heav'n! They hail their blest Companion, gain'd so soon A Partner of their Joys; and Crown with Stars, Almost as fair, the Radiance of his Brows. Ev'n where the Angel Host, with Tongues of Fire, Chaunt to their glittering Harps th' Almighty's Praise, And, in a burning Circle, shout around The Jasper-throne, he mingles Flames with them; He springs into the Center of the Choir, And, drinking in the Spirit-most-divine, He sings as sweet, and glows as bright as They.

Shall I complain (When such th' establish'd Ordinance of Heav'n) If Sickness at my Bosom lay the Siege? A Worm to Them! and to their Light a Shade, Ungilded with one Beam, which melted down The Tear fast-trickling o'er their honour'd Tombs: We all must dye! Our every pulse that beats, Beats toward Eternity, and tolls our Doom. Fate reigns in all the Portions of the Year. The Fruits of Autumn feed us for Disease; The Winter's raw Inclemencies bestow Disease on Death; while Spring, to strew our Herse, Kindly unbosoms, weeping in their Dews, Her flow'ry Race! and Summer (kinder still) With the green Turf and Brambles binds our Graves. But am I wake? or in Ovidian Realms, And Circè holds the Glass? What odious Change, What Metamorphose strikes the dubious Eye? Ah, whither is retir'd the scarlet Wave, Mantling with Health, which floated through the Cheek, From the strong Summer-beam imbib'd? And where The vernal Lilly's foftly-blended Bloom? The Forehead roughens to the wond'ring Hand. Wide o'er the Human-field, the Body, spreads Contagious War, and lays its Beauties waste. As once thy breathing Harvest, Cadmus, sprung, Cadmus is reported by the Poets to have slain a monstrous Serpent in Bœotia, at the Command of Minerva; and sowed its Teeth in a Field, which produced an Host of armed Soldiers; who, fighting, slew one other. See Ovid. Met. l. iii. Suidas, Pausanias, &amp;c. 'Tis said, that he sowed Serpents Teeth, and that Soldiers in Armour sprung up from them; because, as Bochart observes, in the Phœnician Language, to express Men armed with brazen Darts and Spears of Brass, they made use of Words, which might be translated “armed with the Teeth of a Serpent.” Sudden, a Serpent-brood! an armed Crop Of growing Chiefs, and fought Themselves to Death. One black-incrusted Bark of gory Boils, One undistinguish'd Blister, from the Soal Of the sore Foot, to the Head's sorer Crown. Job's Punishment! With Patience like his own, O may I exercise my wounded Soul, And cast myself upon his healing Hand, Who bruiseth at his Will, and maketh whole. Ah, too, the Lustre of the Eyes is fled! Heavy and dull, their Orbs neglect to roll, In motionless Distortion stiff and fix'd; Till by the trembling Hand of watchful Age (A weeping Matron, timorous to affright, And piously fallacious in her Care, Pretending Light offensive, and the Sun) Clos'd; and, perhaps, for ever! ne'er again To open on the Sphere, to drink the Day, Or (worse!) behold Ianthe's Face divine, And wonder o'er her Charms.—But yet forbear, O dare not murmur; 'tis Heav'n's high Behest: Tho' Darkness through the Chambers of the Grave This Dust pursue, and Death's sad Shade involve, E'er long, the Filial-light himself shall shine; (The Stars are Dust to him, the Sun a Shade) These very Eyes, these Tunicles of Flesh, Ev'n tho' by Worms destroy'd, shall see my God, And, seeing, ne'er remember Darkness more, Environ'd with Eternity of Day.

The Sun Resigns the Reins of Phlegon to my Hands: His mane Waves fire: he scorches me to Dust: Avaunt, thou Fiend!—I'll hurl thee down the Deep Of Heav'n, with bolted Thunder, and enwrapt With forky Light'ning.—Now staggering I reel, By Murderers pursu'd: my faithless Feet Scarce shift their Pace: or down rushing amain, I cease to recollect my Steps, and roll Passive on earth.—Sure, 'twas Astolpho's Horn A Horn, in which if he do once but blow, The Noise thereof shall trouble Men so sore, That all both stout and faint shall fly therefro, So strange a Noise was never heard before. Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, translated by Sir John Harrington, B. xv. Stanz. 10. With this Horn Astolpho affrighted the Amazons. See Book xx. St. 60, &amp;c. and even Rogero, Bradamant, &amp;c. in dissolving the enchanted Palace, B. xxii. St. 18, &amp;c. Drives away the Harpies from Senapo, B. xxxiii. St. 114, &amp;c. Pour'd on my Ear th' annoying Blast: At which, Rogero trembled, Bradamant grew pale, And into Air dissolv'd th' Enchanted Dome. Now starting from this Wilderness of Dreams, I wake from fancy'd into real Woe. Pain emptys all her Vials on my Head, And steeps me o'er and o'er. Th' envenom'd Shirt Of Hercules enwraps my burning Limbs With Dragon's Blood: I rave and roar like him, Writhing in Agony. Devouring Fires Eat up the Marrow, frying in my Bones. O whither, whither shall I turn for Aid?— Methinks a Seraph whispers in my Ears, Pouring Ambrosia on them, “Turn to God; So Peace shall be thy Pillow, ease thy Bed, And Night of Sorrow brighten into Noon. Let the young cherub Patience, bright-ey'd Hope, And rosy-finger'd Pray'r, combining hold A sure Dominion in thy purpos'd Mind, Unconquer'd by Affliction.”—I receive The Mandate as from Heav'n itself.—Expand Thyself, my Soul, and let them enter in. Come, smiling Angel, Patience, from thy Seat; Whether the Widow's Cot, or Hermit's Cell, By Fasting strong, and potent from Distress; Or Midnight-student's taper-glimmering Roof, Unwearied with revolving tedious Tomes, O come, thou Panacæa of the Mind! The Manna of the Soul! to every Taste Grateful alike: the universal Balm To Sickness, Pain, and Misery below. She comes! she comes! she dissipates the Gloom; My eyes she opens, and new Scenes unfolds (Like Moses' Bush, tho' burning, not consum'd) Scenes full of Splendour, Miracle, and God. Behold, my Soul, the Martyr-army, Who With holy Blood the Violence of Fire Quench'd, and with lingring Constancy fatigu'd The persecuting Flame: or nobly stop'd The Lion's Mouth, and triumph'd in his Jaws. Hark, how the Virgin white-rob'd-tender Train Chaunt Hallelujahs to the Rack; as dear And pleasing to the Ear of God, as Hymns Of Angels on the Resurrection-morn, When all the Host of Heaven Hosanna sing! Yet further; lift thy Eyes upon the Cross, A bleeding Saviour view, a dying God! Earth trembles, rend the Rocks, Creation groans: The Sun, asham'd, extinguishes the Day: All Nature suffers with her suffering Lord. Amidst this War of Elements, serene, And as the Sun-shine Brow of Patience, calm, He dies without a Groan, and smiles in Death. Shall Martyrs, Virgins, nay, thy Saviour bleed To teach thee Patience? and yet bleed in vain? Forbid it, Reason; and forbid it, Heav'n. No; suffer: and, in Suffering, rejoice. Patience endureth all, and hopeth all. Hope is her Daughter then. Let Hope distill Her Cordial-spirit, as Hybla-honey sweet, And healing as the Drops of Gilead-balm. Cease to repine, as those who have no Hope; Nor let Despair approach thy darkest Hour. Despair! that Triple-Death! th' imperial Plague! Th' exterminating Angel of th' accurst, And sole Disease of which the damn'd are sick, Kindling a Fever hotter than their Hell— O pluck me from Despair, white-handed Hope! O interpose thy Spear and silver Shield Betwixt my Bosom and the Fiend! detrude This impious Monster to primæval Hell; To its own dark Domain: But light my Soul, Imp'd with thy glittering Wings, to Scenes of Joy, To Health and Life, for Health and Life are thine: And fire Imagination with the Skies. But whence this Confidence of Hope? In Thee, And in thy Blood, my Jesus! (Bow, O Earth! Heav'n bends beneath the Name, and all its Sons, The Hierarchy! drop low the prostrate Knee, And sink, in humble wise, upon the Stars.) Yes, on Thy Blood and Name my Hope depends.— My Hope? nay, Worlds on Worlds depend on Thee; Live in Thy Death, from Thy Sepulchre rise. Thy influential Vigour reinspires This feeble Frame; dispells the Shade of Death; And bids me throw myself on God in Prayer. A Christian Soul is God's beloved House; And Pray'r the Incense which perfumes the Soul: Let Armies then of Supplications rise, Besiege the golden Gates of Heav'n, and force, With holy Violence, a Blessing down In living Streams. If Hezekiah's Pray'r The Sun arrested in his prone Career, And bade the Shadow ten Degrees return On Ahaz-dial, whirling back the Day: Pour out thyself, my Soul! with fervent Zeal, With over-flowing Ardour, and with Faith Unwav'ring. To assist me, and to swell My fainting Spirits to sublime Desires, Wou'd Bishop Jeremy Taylor. Taylor from his starry Throne descend, How Fear wou'd brighten! by his sacred Aid, To live were Happiness, and gain to die.— No: let him still adorn his starry Throne, Well-merited by Labours so divine: For, lo! the Man of God, and Friend of Man, Theron, the purest Breast, and warmest Heart, Flys on the Wings of Charity and Love To join me in the Saving-Task, and raise My weaker Pow'rs with his abundant Zeal; Pure, sweet, and glowing as the incens'd Fires, Of, Solomon, thy Golden-Altar, fann'd By Wings of Cherubins into a Flame; Till on the Skies the aromatick Gale In Pyramids of Fragrance softly stole, A grateful Offering to the Throne of Grace. Still, tho' I feel these Succours from the Skies, In Operation mighty! still remain Inferior Aids behind: terrestrial Stores Medicinal: the Instruments of God. For God created the Physician! God Himself on Earth, our great Physician! spread O'er Sick and Weak, shadowing, his healing Wings: Each Miracle a Cure!—Before Disease, Offspring of Sin, infested Human-kind, In Paradise, the vegetable Seeds Sprung from their Maker's Hand, invigorate-strong With Med'cin. He foresaw our future Ills; Foreseeing, he provided ample Cure; Fossils, and Simples: Solomon, thy Theme, Nature's Historian; wisest of the Wise! Tho' Paradise be lost, the Tree of Life In med'cin Blooms; then pluck its healing Fruits, And with Thansgiving eat; and, Eating, live. Ev'n pagan Wisdom bade her Sons adore, As one, the God of Physick and the Day, Fountain of Vegetation and of Life, Apollo, ever blooming, ever young, And from his Art immortal! Thus, of yore, The prime of human Race from Heav'n deduc'd The bright original of Physick's Pow'r: And, nor unjustly, deem'd that he who sav'd Millions from Death, himself shou'd never die. An Instrument of various Pipes and Tubes, Veins, Arteries, and Sinews, organiz'd, Man, when in Healthy-tune, harmonious wakes The Breath of Melody, in Vocal-praise, Delighting Earth and Heav'n! discordant, oft, As Accident, or Time, or Fate prevail, This Human-organ scarce the Bellows heaves Of Vital-respiration; or in Pain, With Pauses sad: What Art divine shall tune To order and refit this shatter'd Frame? What Fingers touch into a Voice again? Or Musick re-inspire? Who, but the Race Of Pæan? who but Physick's saving Sons? A Ratcliff, Frewin, Metcalf or a Friend?— But something yet, beyond the kindly Skill Of Pæan's Sons, Disease, like mine, demands; Nepenthe to the Soul, as well as Life. O for a Mother's watchful Tenderness, And Father's venerable Care!—But See Tome 1st, Page 132, &amp;c. They, In Life immortal, gather endless Joys, Reward of Charity, of Innocence, Of pleasing Manners, and a Life unblam'd! The Tears of Poverty and Friendship oft Their modest Tombs bedew, where Eden's Flood, ?Eden, tho' but small, Yet often stain'd with Blood of many a Band Of Scots and English both, that tined on his Strand. Spenser's Fairy Queen, Book iv. Canto II. (Ituna 'clep'd by Bards of old Renown, Purpled with Saxon and with British Blood) Laves the sweet Vale, that first my pratling Muse Provok'd to Numbers, broken as the Ruins Of Roman Towers which deck its lofty Banks, And shine more beauteous by Decay.—But hark! What Musick glads my Ear? 'Tis Theron's Voice, Theron a Father, Mother; both, a Friend!— Pain flies before his animating Touch: The gentle Pressure of his cordial Hand, A burning Mountain from my Bosom heaves! What Wonders, sacred Friendship, flow from thee! One Period from a Friend enlivens more, Than all Hippocrates and Galen's Tomes, Than all the Med'cines they unfold. I feel Myself renew'd! not only Health, but Youth, Rolls the brisk Tide, and sparkles at my Heart. As the Live-atoms of Campanian Wines Dance in the Virgin crystal, and o'erlook With glorifying Foam, the nectar'd Brim; Smiling, and lending Smiles to social Wit, The jocund Hearth, and hospitable Board. Friendship is a Religion, from the first The second-best: it points, like that, to Heav'n, And almost antidates, on Earth, its Bliss. But Vice and Folly never Friendship knew; It was an Observation of Socrates, that wicked Men cannot be Friends either amongst themselves or with good Men. Xenoph. Memorab. l. ii. Whilst Wisdom grows by Friendship still more Wise. Her Fetters, are a strong Defence; her Chains, A Robe of Glory; Ophir gold, her Bands; And he who wears them, wears a Crown of Joy. Friendship's the Steel, which struck emits the Sparks Of Candour, Peace, Benevolence, and Zeal; Spreading their glowing Seeds—A holy Fire Where Honour beams on Honour, Truth on Truth; Bright as the Eyes of Angels and as pure. An Altar whence two gentle-loving Hearts Mount to the Skies in one conspiring Blaze And spotless Union. 'Tis the Nectar-stream Which feeds and elevates seraphic Love— Health is Disease, Life Death, without a Friend. The End of the Third Book. THE RECOVERY. Book IV.

Comparison between Sickness and Health in Regard to the Body and Mind. Swift too, thy Tale is told: a Sound, a Name, No more than Lucian, Butler, or Scarron. Fantastic Humour drop'd the feeling Sense, Her Empire less'ning by his Fall. The Shades Of frolick Rabelais, and He of Spain, Madrid's facetious Glory, join his Ghost; Triumvirate of Laughter!—Mirth is mad; The loudest Languishing into a Sigh: And Laughter shakes itself into Decay. “Lord! what is Man?” the Prophet well might ask; We all may ask, “Lord! what is mortal Man?” So changeable his Being, with himself Dissimilar; the Rainbow of an Hour! A Change of Colours, transient through his Life, Brightens or languishes;—then fades to Air. Ev'n e're an artful Spider spins a Line Of Metaphysick Texture, Man's thin Thread Of Life is broken: how analogous Their Parallel of Lines! slight, subtle, vain, Man, in a little Hour's contracted Round Perplexes Reason: now to triumph swell'd, To joyous Exultations, to a Blaze Of Ecstasy; and now depress'd, again, And drooping into Scenes of Death and Woe. That sudden Flow of Spirits, bright and strong, Which play'd in sprightly Sallies round my Heart; Was it a Gleam, fore-warning me from Heav'n, Of quick-approaching Fate? As Tapers mount Expiring into wide-diffusive Flame, Give one broad Glare, into the Socket sink, And Sinking disappear.—It must be so!— The Soul, prophetick of it's Voy'ge, descry'd The blissful Shore, exulting on the Wing, In a glad Flutter: then, o'erwhelm'd with Joy, She warn'd her old Companion of her Flight, (The feeble Tenement of mould'ring Clay) Who sadden'd at their Parting.—Yes,—I feel Thy leaden Hand, O Death! it presses hard, It weighs the Faculties of Motion down, Inactive as the Foot of a dull Rock, And drags me to thy dusty Chains: the Wheels Of Life are fastned to the Grave, nor whirl, Longer, the fiery Chariot on. The War, The Struggle for Eternity begins. Eternity! illimitable, vast, Incomprehensible! For Heav'n and Hell, Within her universal Womb, profound, Are center'd.—Sleep or Death are on my Heart: Swims heavily my Brain:—My Senses reel. What Scenes disclose themselves! What Fields of Joy! What Rivers of Delight! What golden Bow'rs! Sweetly oppress'd with beatifick Views, I hear Angelick-instruments, I see Primæval Ardours, and essential Forms; The Sons of Light, Light is the first-born of all Creatures, and it is commonly observed that the Angels were created at the same Period of Time. St. Austin thinks them meant under Fiat Lux, Let there be Light: De Civitate Dei, l. xi. c. 9. This indeed is only conjectural, and we have no Article of the Apostles Creed which directs upon any Considerations of Angels; because perhaps it exceeds the Faculties of Men to understand their Nature, and it may not conduce much to our practical Edification to know them. Yet however this Observation may serve to illustrate that beautiful Passage in the Book of Job: When the Morning-Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for Joy. but of created Light, All Energy, the Diligence of God! Might I but join them! Lend your glitt'ring Wings, Waft me, O quickly waft me to you Crown, Bright with the flaming Roses of the Zone Sidereal: Gracious, they, beck'ning, smile, They smile me to the Skies! Hope leads the Way: Mounting I spring to seize!—What Fury shakes Her fiery Sword, and intercepts the Stars? Ha! Amartia? Conscience, Conscience sends Her griesly Form, to blast me at my End. Behold! she points to burning Rocks, to Waves Sulphureous, molten Lead, and boiling Gulphs, Tempestuous with everlasting Fire.— 'Tis horrible!—O save me from myself!— O save me, Jesu!—Ha! a Burst of Light Blends with the Empyréum's azure Tide, While Faith, triumphant, swells the Trump of God, And Shouting, “Where's thy Victory, O Grave? And where, O Death, thy Sting?” I see her spread Her saving Banner o'er my Soul (the Cross!) And call it to its Peers. Thick Crowds of Day, Immaculate, involve me in their Streams, And bathe my Spirit, whiten'd for the Sky. While on this Isthmus of my Fate I lye, Jutting into Eternity's wide Sea, And leaning on this habitable Globe, The Verge of either World! dubious of Life, Dubious, alike, of Death; to Mercy thus, Inspirited with supplicating Zeal, My Guardian-Angel rais'd his potent Pray'r. (For Angels minister to Man, intent On Offices of Gentleness and Love.) “Hear, Mercy! sweetest Daughter of the Skies, Thou loveliest Image of thy Father's Face, Thou blessed Fount, whence Grace and Goodness flow, Auspicious, hear! extend thy helping Arm, With pitying Readiness, with willing Aid, O lift thy Servant from the Vale of Death, Now groveling in the Dust, into the Fields Of Comfort, and the Pastures green of Health. Hear, Mercy, sweetest Daughter of the Skies! If e're thy Servant to the Poor his Soul Drew out, and taught the Fatherless to sing; If e're by Pity warm'd, and not by Pride, He cloath'd the Naked, and the Hungry fed; If e're Distress, and Misery, forelorn, Deceiv'd his Cheek, and stole his untaught Tear, An humble Drop of thy celestial Dew! Hear, Mercy, sweetest Daughter of the Skies. Sprung from the Bosom of eternal Bliss, Thy Goodness reaches farther than the Grave; And near the Gates of Hell extends thy Sway, Omnipotent! All, save the cursed Crew Infernal, and the black-rebellious Host Of Lucifer, within thy sweet Domain Feed on Ambrosia, and may hope the Stars. Hear, Mercy, sweetest Daughter of the Skies. By thee, the great Physician from the Bed Of Darkness call'd the Sick, the Blind, the Lame; He burst the Grave's relentless Bars by thee, And spoke the Dead to Life and Bloom again. His Miracles, thy Work; their Glory, thine: Then, O thou dearest Attribute of God! Thy saving Health to this thy Servant lend! Hear, Mercy, sweetest Daughter of the Skies!” Inclin'd upon a dewy-skirted Cloud Purpled with Light, and dropping Fatness down, Plenty and Bliss on Man, with looks as mild As Ev'ning Suns (when flowry-footed May Leads on the jocund Hours, when Love himself Flutters in Green) effusing heart-felt Joy Abundant, Mercy shone with sober Grace, And Majesty at once with Sweetness mix'd Ineffable. A Rainbow o'er her Head, The Covenant of God, betok'ning Peace 'Twixt Heav'n and Earth, its florid Arch display'd, High-bended by th' Almighty's glorious Hand; The Languish of the Dove upon her Eyes In placid Radiance melted, from the Throne Of Grace infus'd, and fed with Light: her Smiles Expansive cheer'd the undetermin'd Tracks Of all Creation, from th' æthereal Cope, August with moving Fires, down to the Shades Infernal; and the Reign of Darkness drear. Ev'n Men refine to Angels from her gaze, Gracious, invigorating, full of Heav'n! This Daughter of the Lamb, to fervent Pray'rs And Intercession, opes her ready Ear, Compassionate; and to Hygeia thus: “Hygeia, hie thee to the Well of Life; There dip thy Fingers; touch his Head and Breast; Three Drops into his Mouth infuse, unseen, Save by the Eye of Faith: he yonder lies— Descend, and take the Ev'ning's western Wing.” She said. Hygeia bow'd; and bowing, fill'd The circumambient Air with od'rous Streams, Pure Essence of Ambrosia! Not the Breath Of Lebanon, from Cedar Allies blown, Of Lebanon, with aromatick Gales Luxuriant, Spikenard, Aloes, Myrrh and Balm; Nor the wise Eastern Monarch's Garden vy'd In Fragrance, when his fair Circassian Spouse, Enamour'd, call'd upon the South to fan It's Beds of Spices, and her Bosom cool, Panting with Languishment and love-sick Fires. Forth from th' eternal Throne the Well of Life, Pouring its Crystal, laves the Streets of God, (Where Sickness never comes, nor Age, nor Pain) Fast-trickling o'er the Pebble-Gems. Beneath Unfading Amarant and Asphodel, A Mirrour spreads its many-colour'd Round, Mosaick-work, inlaid by Hands divine In glist'ring Rows, illuminating each, Each shading: Beryl, Topaz, Chalcedon, Em'rald and Amethyst. Whatever Hues The Light reflects, celestial Quarries yield, Or melt into the vernant-showry Bow, Profusive, vary here in mingling Beams. Collected thus the Waters, dimpling, end Their soft-progressive Lapse. The Cherubs hence Immortal Vigour quaff and Bliss unblam'd. Nor only flow for you, ye Sons of Light, The Streams of Comfort and of Life, but flow To heal the Nations. Wonderful to tell, The aged they renew, the dead revive, And more, the Festers of the wounded Soul, Corrupted, black, to pristine White relume White has been accounted in all Ages the peculiar Tincture of Innocence, and white Vestments worn by Persons delegated for sacred Offices, &amp;c. When our Saviour was transfigured before his Disciples, his Raiment became shining, exceeding white as Snow, Mark, chap. ix. 3. When he ascended into Heaven, the Angels descended in white Apparel, Acts i. 10. And to the Spouse of the Lamb was granted that she should be array'd in fine Linen, clean and white, which is the Righteousness of the Saints, Rev. xix. ver. 8, 14. Hence the Custom of the primitive Church of Cloathing the Persons baptized in white Garments. Inde Parens sacro ducens de fonte Sacerdos Infantes, niveo corpore, mente, habitu. Paulinus, Epist. xii. The Heathens paid likewise a great Regard to White: Color albus præcipuè Deo charus est. Cicero de Leg. Lib. ii. ?Ante aras stat veste Sacerdos Effulgens nivea. Silius Ital. Lib. iii. Delius hic longè candenti veste Sacerdos Occurrit. Valerius Flacc. Lib. ii. And not only the Priests, but likewise those who attended at the Sacrifices and paid their Devotions to their Gods: Cernite fulgentes ut eat sacer agnus ad aras, Tinctaque pòst oleâ candida Turba comas. Tibull. Lib. ii. Eleg. 1. And Ovid: Linguis candida Turba favet. Fast. Lib. ii. I shall only add one Passage, from Plautus: ?Ergo æquius vos erat Candidatas venire, hostiatasque ad hoc Fanum. Rudens. Act. i. Sc. 5. And Saint-like Innocence. The mystic Dove Broods, purifying o'er them, with his Wings. The Angel, who Bethesda's troubled Pool Stirr'd, first his Pinions with these vital Drops Sprinkled; then pour'd himself into the Flood, Instilling Health and Nutriment divine, Its waves to quicken, and exalt its Pow'rs. Here lights Hygeia, ardent to fulfil Mercy's Behest. The Bloom of Paradise Liv'd on her youthful Cheek, and glow'd the Spring. The deep Carnations in the Eastern Skies, When ruddy Morning walks along the Hills, Illustriously red, in purple Dews, Are languid to her Blushes; for She blush'd As through the op'ning File of winged Flames, Bounding, she lightned, and her sapphire Eyes With modest Lustre bright, improving Heav'n, Cast, sweetly, round, and bow'd to her Compeers, An Angel amid Angels. Light she sprung Along th' empyreal Road: Her Locks distill'd Salubrious Spirit on the Stars. Full soon She pass'd the Gate of Pearl, and down the Sky, Præcipitant, upon the Ev'ning-Wing Cleaves the live Æther, and with healthy Balm Impregnates, and Fœcundity of Sweets. Conscious of her Approach, the wanton Birds, Instinctive, carol forth, in livelier Lays, And merrier Melody, their grateful Hymn, Brisk-flutt'ring to the Breeze. Eftsoons the Hills, Beneath the Gambols of the Lamb and Kid, Of petulant Delight, the circling Maze (Brush'd off its Dews) betray. All Nature smiles, With double Day delighted. Chief, on Man The Goddess ray'd herself: He, wond'ring, feels His Heart in driving Tumults, vig'rous, leap, And gushing Ecstasy: bursts out his Tongue In Laud, and unpremeditated Song, Obedient to the Musick in his Veins. Thus, when at first, the instantaneous Light Sprung from the Voice of God, and, vivid, threw Its golden Mantle round the rising Ball, The cumb'rous Mass, shot through with vital Warmth And plastick Energy, to motion roll'd The drowzy Elements, and active Rule: Sudden the Morning Stars, together, sang, And shouted all the Sons of God for Joy. Enters Hygeia, and her Task performs, With healing Fingers touch'd my Breast and Head; Three Drops Hygeia here performs her Office in the very Manner she was order'd by Mercy. I have, after the Manner of Homer, used the same Expressions over again, as when she received the Mandate. The Father of Poetry constantly makes his Envoys observe this Practice, as a Mark of Decency and Respect. into my Mouth infus'd, unseen, Save by the Eye of Faith: Then re-ascends. As Snow in Salmon, at the tepid Touch Of southern Gales, by soft Degrees, dissolves Trickling, yet slow, away; and loosen'd Frosts The genial Impress feel of vernal Suns, Relenting to the Ray; my torpid limbs The Healing Virtue of Hygeia's Hand And salutary Influence perceive, Instant to wander through the whole. My Heart Begins to melt, o'er-running into Joy, Late froze with Agony. Kind Tumults seize My Spirits, conscious of returning Health, And dire Disease abating from the Cells And mazy Haunts of Life. The judging Leech Approves the Symptoms, and my Hope allows. The hostile Humours cease to bubble o'er Their big-distended Channels; quiet now And sinking into Peace. The Organs heave Kindlier with Life: And Nature's Fabrick near To Dissolution shatter'd, and its Mould To Dust dissolv'd, tho' not its pristine Strength (The lusty Vigour of its healthy Prime) Yet gentle Force recovers; to maintain, Against the Tyrant-Death's batt'ring Assaults. The Fort of Life.—But Darkness, present still, And absent sweet Repose, best Med'cine, Sleep, Forbid by Heart the full Carouse of Joy. “Soft Pow'r of Slumbers, dewy-feather'd Sleep, Kind Nurse of Nature! whither art thou fled, A Stranger to my Senses, weary'd out With Pain, and aking for thy Presence? Come, O come! embrace me in thy liquid Arms; Exert thy drowzy Virtue, wrap my Limbs In downy Indolence, and bathe in Balm, Fast-flowing from th' Abundance of thy Horn, With Nourishment replete, and richer stor'd Than Amalthea's; Amalthea the Daughter of Melissus King of Crete, and Nurse of Jupiter, who fed him with Goats-Milk and Honey. But this Story is differently related. See Strabo, l. x. Diodor. Sicul. l. iv. c. 5. and Ovid. Fast. l. v. It is very remarkable that the Translation of the Septuagint uses the Expression Amalthea's Horn, for the Name of Job's third Daughter Keren-happuc (so called from her Beauty) alluding to a Grecian Fable invented long after; Job ch. the last, ver. 14. The same Translation likewise mentions Arachne in the ninetieth Psalm, and 9th Verse, which Image is left out in all our late Versions. A Christian Poet therefore may surely be excused for using the Word Ambrosia, &amp;c. or drawing Metaphors or Comparisons from the Pagan Mythology in a serious Composition; which is the Practice of Milton and some of the best Poets. The Fault only is, when the Poet weaves the Heathen Fables with the Jewish and Christian Truths. As when Sannazarius introduces the Furies, Cerberus, &amp;c. into his Poem (which is otherwise a very fine one) De Partu Virginis. And likewise when Camoens blends the Adventures of Bacchus with the Miracles of Christ, &amp;c. in his Lusiad. But this by the by. who (so Poets feign) With Honey and with Milk supply'd a God, And fed the Thunderer. Indulgent quit Thy Couch of Poppies! steal thyself on me, (In rory Mists suffus'd and Clouds of Gold) On me, thou mildest Cordial of the World? The Shield his Pillow, in the tented Field, By Thee, the Soldier, bred in Iron-war, Forgets the mimick Thunders of the Day, Nor envies Luxury her Bed of Down. Rock'd by the Blast, and cabbin'd in the Storm, The Sailor huggs Thee to the doddering Mast, Of Shipwreck negligent, while Thou art kind. The Captive's Freedom, Thou! the Labourer's Hire; The Beggar's Store; the Miser's better Gold; The Health of Sickness; and the Youth of Age! At thy Approach the wrinkled Front of Care Subsides into the smooth Expanse of Smiles. And, stranger far! the Monarch, crown'd by Thee, Beneath his Weight of Glory gains Repose. What Guilt is mine, that I alone am wake, Ev'n tho' my Eyes are seal'd, am wake alone? Ah seal'd, but not by Thee! The World is dumb; Exhal'd by Air, an awful Silence rules, Still as thy Brother's Reign, or Foot of Time; Ev'n Nightingales are mute, and Lovers rest, Steep'd in thy Influence, and cease to sigh, Or only sigh in Slumbers. Fifteen Nights The Moon has walk'd in Glory o'er the Sky; As oft the Sun has shone her from the Sphere, Since, gentle Sleep, I felt thy cordial Dews. Then listen to my Moaning; nor delay To sooth me with thy Softness; to o'ershade Thy Suppliant with thy Pinions: or at least, Lightly to touch my Temples with thy Wand. So, full and frequent, may the crimson Fields With Poppies blush, nor feel a Tarquin's Hand. So may the West-Wind's Sigh, th' murm'ring Brook, The Melody of Birds, Ianthe's Lute, And Musick of the Spheres, be all the Sounds That dare intrude on thy devoted Hour. Nor Boreas bluster, nor the Thunder roar, Nor Screech-Owl flap his Wing, nor Spirit yell, As 'neath the Trembling of the Moon he walks, Within the Circle of thy still Domain. He comes! he comes! the reconciling Pow'r Of Pain, Vexation, Care, and Anguish comes! He hovers in the lazy Air:—He melts, With Honey-heaviness, my Senses down.— —I thank thee, Sleep!—Heav'ns! is the Day restor'd To my desiring Eyes? their Lids, unglew'd, Admit the long-lost Light, now streaming in Painfully clear!—O check the rapid Gleam With shading Silk, 'till the weak visual Orb, Stronger and stronger, dares imbibe the Sun, Nor, wat'ring, twinkles at unfolded Day. As, where, in Lapland, Night collects her Reign, Oppressive, over half the rounded Year Uninterrupted with one struggling Beam; Young Orra-Moor, in furry Spoils inroll'd, Shagged and warm, first spies th' imperfect Blush Of op'ning Light, exulting; scarce her Eyes The Lustre bear, tho' faint; but, wid'ning fast Th' unbounded Tide of Splendor covers, fair, Th' expanded Hemisphere; and fills her Sight With Gladness, while her Heart, warm-leaping, burns. Sight, all-expressive! Tho' the feeling Sense Thrills from Ianthe's Hand; at Handel's Lyre Tingles the Ear; tho' Smell from blossom'd Beans Arabian Spirit gathers; and the Draught, Sparkling from Burgundy's exalted Vines, Streams Nectar on the Palate: Yet, O Sight! Weak their Sensations, when compar'd with Thee. Without Thee, Nature lies unmeaning Gloom. Whatever smiles on Earth, or shines in Heav'n, From Star of Venus to Adonis Flow'r; Whatever Spring can promise; Summer warm To rich Maturity; gay Autumn roll Into the Lap of Plenty, or her Horn; Winter's majestic Horrors;—all are Thine. All varying in Order's pleasing Round, In regular Confusion grateful All! And now progressive Health, with kind Repair, My fever-weaken'd Joints and languid Limbs New-brace. Live Vigour and auxiliar'd Nerves Sinew the freshen'd Frame in Bands of Steel. As in the Trial of the furnace Ore, From baser Dregs refin'd, and drossy Scum, Flames more refulgent, and admits the Stamp Of Majesty to dignify the Gold, Cæsar or George! the human Body, thus, Enamel'd, not deform'd, from Sickness' Rage More manly Features borrows, and a Grace Severe, yet worthier of its Sovereign Form. The Patriarch of Uz, Son of the Morn, Envy'd of Lucifer, by Sores and Blanes Sharply improv'd, to fairer Honours rose; Less his Beginning blest than latter End. How late a tortur'd-Lump of baleful Pain, The Soul immerg'd in one inactive Mass Of breathing Blanes, each Elegance of Sense, Each intellectual Spark and fiery Seed Of Reason, Mem'ry, Judgment, Taste and Wit, Extinct and smother'd in unwieldy Clay Scarce animated: and (O Blessing!) now I seem to tread the Winds; to overtake The empty Eagle in her early Chase, Or nimble-trembling Dove, from preyful Beak, In many a rapid, many a cautious Round, Wheeling precipitant: I leave behind, Exulting o'er its aromatic Hills, The bounding Bether-Roe. The Poet's Mind, (Effluence essential of Heat and Light!) Not mounts a loftier Wing, when Fancy leads The glitt'ring Track, and points him to the Skies, Excursive: He empyreal Air inhales, Earth fading from his Flight! triumphant soars Amid the Pomp of Planetary Worlds, Ranging Infinitude, beyond the Stretch Of Newton's Ken, Reformer of the Spheres, And, gaining on the Heav'ns, enjoys His Home! The Winter of Disease all pass'd away, The Spring of Health, in bloomy Pride, calls forth Embosom'd Bliss, of rosy-winged Praise The rising Incense, the impassion'd Glance Of Gratitude, the Pant of Honour, quick With emulating Zeal; the florid Wish For sacred Happiness, and cordial Glow From conscious Virtue felt: all the sweet Train Of Vernal Solitude's refining Walks, Best Gift of Heav'n, and Source of nameless Joys!

Conclusion. Come, Contemplation! therefore, from thy Haunts, From Spenser's Tomb, (with reverent Steps and slow Oft-visited by me; certès, by all, Touch'd by the Muse:) from Richmond's-green Retreats, Where Mr. James Thomson. Nature's Bard the Seasons on his Page Stole from the Year's rich Hand: or Welwyn Groves, Where Young, the Friend of Virtue and of Man, Sows with poetick Stars the Nightly Song, To Phœbus dear as is own Day! and drowns The Nightingale's Complaint in sadder Strains And sweeter Elegance of Woe, O come! Now Ev'ning mildly-still and softer Suns (While every Breeze is flowing Balm) invite To taste the fragrant Spirit of the Spring Salubrious; from Mead or Hawthorn-hedge Aromatiz'd, and pregnant with Delight No less than Health. And what a Prospect round Swells greenly-grateful on the cherish'd Eye! A universal Blush! a Waste of Sweets! How live the Flow'rs, and, as the Zephyrs blow, Wave a soft Lustre on their Parent-sun, And thank him with their Odours for his Beams; Mild Image of himself! reflected fair, By Faintness fair, and amiably mild! Hark! how the airy Echoes talk along With undulating Answer, soft or loud, The mocking Semblance of the imag'd Voice, Babling itinerant from Wood to Hill, From Hill to Dale, and wake their Sisters round, To multiply Delight upon the Ear. As float the Clouds, romantic Fancy pours The Magazines of Proteus forth, and builds Huge Castles in the Air; while Vessels sail Spacious, along the fluid Element; And Dragons burn in Gold, with azure Stains Speckled: Ten thousand inconsistent Shapes Shift on the Eye, and through the Welkin roll. Here tufted Hills!-there shining Villas rise, Circling; and Temples, solemn, fill the Mind With Beauty, Splendor, and religious Awe! Peace o'er the Plains expands her snowy Wing, Dove-ey'd; and buxom Plenty laughs around! Far different Objects mortify the Eye Along thy Borders, Scheld: This was written at the Time of the Siege of Tournay. (with William's Tears Ennobled, Tears from brave Humanity And Royal Pity drawn! nor of his Blood Less prodigal!) Instead of herbag'd Plains, Of Fields with golden Plenty waving wide, Of lowing Vallies, and of fleecy Hills: What Magazines of Death! what flaming Swords Destruction brandish; what a burnish'd Glare Of Horror wanders round; what Carnage vile Of dubitable Limbs; what groaning Piles Of dying Warriors on th' ensanguin'd Earth (Ev'n Sons of Britain, Chiefs of high Renown) Grov'ling in Dust, and with unmartial Fires Sheer blasted! O 'tis pitiful to Sight! It smites the honest Brain and Heart! The Cloud, Belch'd from the brazen Throat of War, wou'd hide, Industrious, the Ruin which it spreads, As if asham'd of Massacre—But hark!— What dire Explosion tears th' embowel'd Sky, And rumbles from th' infernal Caves? The Roar Of Ætna's troubled Caverns, when she heaves Trinacria from her marble Pillars, fix'd On the Foundations of the solid Earth, And Thetis' bellows from her distant Dens, O'erwhelm the Ear!—A Mine with deadly Stores Infuriate, burst; and a whole squadron'd Host Whirl'd through the riven Air. A human Show'r With smouldry Smoak enroll'd and wrapt in Fire, To cover Earth with Desolation drear!— Curst be the Man, the Monk, the Son of Hell, The triple Moloch! whose mechanic Brain, Maliciously inventive, from its Forge, Of cruel Steel, the sulphur Seeds of Wrath Flash'd on the World, and taught us how to kill; To hurl the blazing Ruin, to disgorge From smoaking Brass the ragged Instruments Of Fate, in Thunder, on the mangled Files Of gallant Foes:—the Cowardice of Hell! And, what the barb'rous Nations never knew, (Tho' nourish'd by the Tigers, and their Tongues Red with the Gore of Lions) to involve The holy Temples, the religious Fanes, To Hallelujahs sacred and to Peace, With dreadless Fires. Shudd'ring the Angels weep At Man's Impiety, and seek the Skies: They weep! while Man, couragious in his Guilt, Smiles at the Infant Writhing on his Spear; The hoary Head pollutes the flinty Streets With scanty Blood; and Virgins pray in Vain. Blush, blush! or own Deucalion for thy Sire. Yet should Rebellion, bursting from the Caves Of Erebus, uprear her Hydra-Form, To poison, Liberty, thy Light divine; If she, audacious, stalk in open Day, And hiss against the Throne by Heav'n's own Hand Establish'd, and Religion Heav'n-Reform'd, Britannia! rescue Earth from such a Bane: Exert thy ancient Spirit; urge thyself Into the Bowels of the glowing War, Sweep her from Day to multiply the Fiends, And scare the Damn'd!—and Thou! the God of Hosts, Supreme! the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings! Thy People, thy Anointed with thy Shield Cover and shade; unbare thy righteous Arm, And save us in the Hollow of thy Hand! Michaël send, as erst against the Host Of Lucifer, and let his Sword be drunk With Rebel-Blood. The Battle is thy own; When Virtue, Liberty, Religion call: Thine is the Victory: the Glory thine! Turn, Contemplation, from this savage Scene Of Violence and Waste: my swimming Eyes Have lost the Beauties of the vernal View! Sweet are the Beauties of the vernal View! And yet Devotion wafts to nobler Themes, And lifts the Soul to Heav'n! For who, untouch'd, With mental Adoration, feeling Laud, Beholds this living-vegetable Whole, This universal Witness of a God! Tho' silent, yet convincing, uncontroul'd, Which meets the Sense, and triumphs in the Soul? Let me, by Isaac's wise Example fir'd, When Meditation led him through the Fields, Sweetly in pious Musings lost, adore My God! for Meditation is too poor, Below the Sacrifice of Christian Hearts: Plato cou'd meditate Far be it from me to speak with Disrespect of this Pagan Philosopher. For my Part, I could almost declare my Admiration of Plato's beautiful Descriptions, &amp;c. in the Words of B. Johnson on Shakespear: “To justify (says he) my own candour, I honour his Memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any.” See his Discoveries, Vol. II. Fol. of his Works. Pag. 98. I only here wou'd observe how falsly, not to say impiously, some modern Writers seem to take pains to recommend Plato's Ideal Morality in Opposition to the glorious Doctrines so fully reveal'd in the Holy Scriptures.; a Christian, more: Christians, from Meditation, soar to Pray'r. Methinks I hear, reprov'd by modern Wit, Or rather Pagan: “Tho' ideal Sounds Soft-wafted on the Zephyr's fancy'd Wing, Steal tuneful Soothings on the easy Ear, New from Ilissus' gilded Mists exhal'd; Tho' gently o'er the Academic Groves, The magic Echoes of unbodied Thoughts Roll their light Billows through th' unwounded Air, In mildest Undulations! yet a The very Expressions of one of our Disciples of Socrates. Priest, Tasteless and peevish, with his Jargon shrill, Scorns Academus; tho' its Flow'rs bestow On Hybla Nectar, purer than her own, From Plato's honey-dropping Tongue distill'd In copious Streams, devolving o'er the Sense Its sweet Regalement!” Philodemus, Alluding to Q. Sectanus's admirable Satires; who introduces much such another Character under this Name. The true Author, as we are inform'd by Mons. Blainville in his curious Travels, is Mons. Sergardi, one of the finest and politest Gentlemen of Rome; by Philodemus, he means one Gravina, an atheistical Pretender to Philosophy, the Greek Language, &amp;c. He thus makes him boast of himself, as if he drew the Principles of his System from Socrates. Nos etenìm (puto jàm nosti) docti sumus, &amp; quos Socraticâ cœpi tractandos mollitèr arte Sordibus emergunt vulgi, totâque probantur Urbe. See Q. Sectani Satyr. 4to, vol. I. Sat. 1. lib. i. v. 108, &amp;c. yes: (Tho' learn'd Lycæum's Cloisters lead the Mind Attentive on, as far as Nature leads: And Plato, for a Heathen, nobler dreams Than dream some modern Poets:) Yes, a Priest, A Priest dares tell you, Salem's hallow'd Walks, And that illumin'd Mountain, where a God, The God of my Salvation, and I hope Of thine, unutterable Beauty beam'd, (Tho' shaded from Excess of Deity, Too fierce for mortal-aking Eyes to prove The Rush of Glory) me, desirous, draw From Athen's Owls, to Jordan's mystic Dove. Thou sing of Nature, and the moral Charms Gild with thy painted Muse: My Fingers lift The Lyre to God! Jehova! Eloim! Truth is my Leader; only Fancy, thine: (Sweet Farinelli of enervate Song!) I quit the Myrtle, for a Starry Crown. And know, if Sickness shed her bluish Plagues From Fog, or Fen, or Town-infected Damps, (And, sure I'd pity thee) among thy Veins: Then, then no Platonist! thy inmost Soul Will thank me for this Preaching; nor disdain To breath itself in Pray'r, as low as mine; From God begin, with God conclude the Song; Thus Glorifying with a Christian-Zeal. Father of Heav'n and Earth! Coæval Son! And co-existing Spirit! Trinal-One! Mysterious Deity; Invisible; Indefinite, and Omnipresent God, Inhabiting Eternity! Shall Dust, Shall Ashes, dare presume to sing of Thee? O for a David's Heart, and Tongue of Fire To rival Angels in my Praise and Zeal! Yet Love immense, and Gratitude, with Awe Religious mix'd, shall elevate the Hymn, My Heart enkindle, and inspire my Tongue. Father-Creator! who beholds Thy Works, But catches Inspiration! Thou the Earth On Nothing hung, and balanc'd in the void With a magnetic Force, and central Poise. Ocean of Brightness Thou! Thy grand Behest Flung on thy Orb, the Sun, a sparkling Drop, To light the Stars, and feed their silver Urns With unexhausted Flame; to bid them shine Eternal in their Courses, o'er the Blue Which mantles Night, and woo us to repose With roscid Radiance. They, harmonious roll, In Majesty of Motion, solemn, loud, The universal Hallelujah: Sphere, In lucid Order, quiring sweet to Sphere, Deep-felt and loftier than a Seraph's Song; The Symphony of well-according Worlds! But Man, thy Beam, thy Breath, thy Image, shines The Crown, the Glory, and the Lord of All; Of all below the Stars! a Plant, from Heav'n Traduc'd, to spread the Riches of its Bloom O'er Earth, and water'd with æthereal Dews; Incorruptíble Aliment! The Birds Warble among his Boughs; the Cattle, safe, Pasture within his Shade; and Earth beneath Th' imperial Umbrage of his Branches smiles. The smiling Earth, the spangled Spheres, and Man Their great Creator praise! but praise how long, Unless by thy Almighty Arm upheld, Preserver infinite? By Thee unless Upheld, the Earth wou'd from her Basis reel; The Spheres forego their Courses, (off their Orbs The silver Softness melted into Shade) Obscurely dissonant; and mortal Man (Void of thy Fostering fires) his stately Form To Dust be moulder'd: Chaos wou'd resume Her ancient Anarchy; Confusion, rule; And Darkness swallow All. In Thee we live, In Thee we move: Our Beings in Thy Chain, Linkt to Eternity, fasten on Thee, The Pillar of our Souls! For me, (how late A Neighbour of the Worm!) when I forget The Wonders of thy Goodness ray'd on me, And cease to celebrate, with Matin-Harp Or Vesper-Song, thy Plenitude of Love, And healing Mercy; may the nightly Pow'r, Which whispers on my Slumbers, cease to breathe Her modulating Impulse through my Soul; Untun'd, unhallow'd! Discord, string my Lyre, Idly, my Finger, press the fretted Gold, Rebellious to the Dictates of my Hand, When indolent, to swell the Notes for Thee, Father of Heav'n and Earth!—Coæval Son! (His Word, His Essence, His Effulgence pure!) Not less thy Filial Likeness I adore, Nor from thy Father's Glory aught disjoin, Redeemer! Mediator! from the Birth Of uncreated Time, thy Father's Wrath (Sprung from Omniscience!) to appease, for Man, Upright as yet, to mediate, Mercy wak'd Unbounded Love in Thee; unbounded Love Contracted to the Measure of a Span Immensity of Godhead, and thy Crown Reft from thy faded Brow. Listen, O Earth! And wonder, O ye Heav'ns! shall He, whose Feet Are cloath'd with Stars, (the Glory of his Head For who can tell?) whose Looks divine illume The dazzel'd Eyes of Cherubs, and the Youth Of Saints with everlasting Bloom renew: Shall He, whose vital Smiles with Splendor fill The Circuits of Creation, and sustain Th' Abodes of all Existence, from the Depths Of Hell beneath, above Heav'n's highest Orb, With Life, and Health, and Joy! shall He, to God Dear as his Eye and Heart, engraven there Deep from Eternity; alone Belov'd, Alone Begotten! say, shall He become A Man of Grief—for Man? nay more his Foe, Rebellious next the Fiends?—Astonishment Had chain'd my Tongue to silence, if the Pow'rs Of tenderest Pity and of warmest Love Provok'd not pensive Measures, sadder Strains Of Elegiack-Sorrow, with the Theme Mournfully varying. Take, my Soul redeem'd! O take the moaning Dove's dew-dropping Wing, Fly, fly to Solyma! and melt thy Woe To Cedron's Murmurs. Thence, extend thy Flight To Golgotha's accursed Tree. Behold! Clouds roll'd on Clouds of Wrath (the blackest Wrath Of an offended God!) His Beauties shade; But shade not long: it soon in Drops dissolves, Sweet to the Soul as Manna to the Taste, As Pride of Summer-Flow'r to Sight or Smell! Behind this shadowing Cloud, this mystic Gloom, The Sharon Rose, dy'd in the Blood of Heav'n, The Lilly of the Vally, white from Stain, Bows the fair Head, in Loveliness declines, And, sweetly languishing, it droops and dies. But darkness veils the Sun: a Curtain draw Before the Passion; beyond Wonder great, Great beyond Silence!—(Awe-struck pause awhile—) And heavy as the Burthen of our Sins!— 'Tis finish'd!—Change the Lyre, the Numbers change; Let holy Anthem-Airs inspire the Hymn. Glory in Heav'n! Redemption to Mankind, And Peace on Earth! Dominion! Blessing! Praise! Thanksgiving! Pow'r! Salvation to our God! Salvation to our God, and to the Lamb! And, co-existing Spirit! Thou, whose Breath My Voice informs, shall it be mute to Thee, Eternal Paraclete? in Order, last, Equal in Glory to Omnipotence The First, as to the Second; and from Both Proceeding; (O inexplicable Name!) Mystical Link of the unnumber'd Three! To Learning, Night; to Faith, the noon-tide Day. Soul of the Universe! The Heathens frequently give the Appellation of Soul or Spirit to God. Thus Virgil: Cœlum &amp; terram camposque liquentes, Lucentemque globum lunæ, Titania que astra Spiritus intus agit. That he means God by Spirit, appears from another Place. ?Deum ire per omnes Terrasque tractusque maris cœlumque profundum. And Zeno's Opinion is very remarkable; ???? ???? ?????? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ??????. See Lactantius, B. vii. c. 3. and Diogenes Laertius in the Life of Zeno. thy Wisdom, first, The Rage compos'd of warring The Elements. A Poem: in Four Books. Elements, (The Subject of a nobler future Song) Yon all-surrounding Heav'ns with crystal Orbs Garnish'd, and living Gems, in goodly Ranks And disciplin'd Array; dividing Night From Day, their Ordinances stablish'd sure. Moving the Waters saw Thee o'er their Face, Cicero tells us that it was Thales's Opinion that God was the Spirit which created all Things from the Water. Thales aquam dîxit esse initium rerum, Deum autem esse Mentem quæ ex aqua cuncta fingeret. De Nat. Deor. l. 1. O God, the Waters saw Thee, and affraid, Into their Channels shrunk, (capacious Bed Of liquid Element!) and own'd their Bounds Impassable, as that eternal Gulph 'Twixt Bliss and Woe.—The Prince of Peace thy Beams Largely imbib'd, when, Dovelike, o'er his Head, Fast by the Banks of Jordan's sacred Stream, Thy mantling Wings diffus'd their heav'nly Hues; And Abba glorify'd his Only Son, Well-pleased.—From thy Tongues of cloven Fire Kindled, the Nations burn'd in flaming Zeal, And unextinguish'd Charity, dispers'd And glowing as the Summer Blaze at Noon. The rushing Winds, on all their Wings convey'd Thy Doctrine, strong to shake the guilty Soul; As, erst, the Dome, low-stooping to its Base, Before thy mighty Presence The very Heathens imagin'd a Commotion in Nature at the Presence of the Deity. —Vibratus ab æthere fulgor Cum sonitu venit, ruere omnia visa repentè. Æneis, lib. 8. And in another Place, Virgil: Vix ea fatus eram, tremere omnia visa repentè Liminaque laurusque Dei, totusque moveri Mons circum. Æneis, lib. 3. So likewise Statius: Mirabar cur templa mihi tremuere Dianæ. Theb. lib. 4. And Seneca: —Imo mugit è fundo solum, Tonat dies serenus, ac totis domus Ut fracta tectis crepuit. Thyestes, Act. II. learn'd to bend. Thou, from the Morning-Womb, Psalm cx. 3. This is a noble Metaphor to express the Beauties and Graces of the Holy Spirit. So that “From the Womb of the Morning” in the Psalmist, signifies this: From the heavenly Light of the Gospel, which is the Wing or Beam whereby the Sun of Righteousness revealeth himself, and breaketh out upon the World, the People shall adorn themselves from the first Forming of Christ in them, with the Dews of Grace, and the Gifts and Emanations of the Holy Ghost: which are Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance. Gal. v, 22, &amp;c. When the Spirit of Christ bloweth thus upon us, and the Dews of Grace are poured into our Hearts, then the Spices flow out, which arise from the holy Duties and spiritual Infusions, mention'd above. upon our Souls, Barren and dry, thy Sanctifying Dews, Abroad, in silent Softness sheds: the Dews Of Love unspotted, uncorrupted Joy; Obedient Goodness, Temperance subdu'd; Unshaken Faith, and Meekness without Guile. Hence flow the Odours out, our Pray'rs perfume, Like Incense, rising fragrant on the Throne, From golden Vials pour'd, by Elder Hands! Rev. v. 8. The four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of the Saints; that is, the Prayers of good Men are as grateful to God as Incense from the Tabernacle. So David, Ps. xiv, 2. Let my Prayer be directed to thee as Incense. Extinct thy influential Radiance, Sin, Incumbent on the Soul, as black as Hell, Holds godless Anarchy: by Thee refin'd, Incens'd, sublim'd, and sanctify'd, the Soul Invites the Holiest (O Abyss of Love!) To chuse a Temple, purer than the Sun, Incorruptíble, formed not by Hands, Where best He loves to dwell.—Thou all my Bed, Most holy Comforter! in Sickness smooth'd, And Violet-Buds, and Roses, without Thorn, Showr'd round the Couch. From Darkness and the Vale Of shadowy Death, to Pastures fair, and Streams Of Comfort, thy refreshing Right-Hand led My wearied Soul, and bath'd in Health and Joy! To Light restor'd, and the sweet Breath of Heav'n, Beneath thy Olive-Boughs, Alluding to the two Olive-Branches in Zecharia; ch. iv. ver. 11 and 12, which empty the golden Oil out of themselves. Amongst other Expositions of which Words, Junius and Tarnovius interpret them, to mean the various Gifts and Effusions of the Holy Spirit, which are, by Christ, deriv'd upon the Church. For Christ is called the Messiah, on Account of his being anointed with the Oil of Gladness; Ps. xiv, 8. And St. John speaketh thus of the Holy Ghost: Ye have an Unction from the Holy One; 1 John ii. 20. The anointing which ye received from him, abideth in you; John, c. ii. v. 27. To Conclude; a Recovery from the Small-Pox a few Years ago, gave Occasion to the preceding Poem. I only at first (in Gratitude to the Great Physician of Souls and Bodies) designed to have published this Hymn to the Trinity upon a Recovery from Sickness. But the Subject being very extensive, and capable of admitting serious Reflections on the frail State of Humanity, I expatiated farther upon it. It cannot be suppos'd that I should treat upon Sickness in a medicinal, but only in a descriptive, a moral, and religious Manner: the Versification is varied accordingly: the descriptive Parts being more poetical; the moral, more plain; and the religious, for the most Part, drawn from the Holy Scriptures. I have just taken such Notice of the Progress of the Small-Pox, as may give the Reader some small Idea of it, without offending his Imagination. These few Notes are not intended for the learned Reader, but added, to assist those who may not be so well acquainted with the classical and other Allusions. I don't remember to have seen any other Poem on the same Subject to lead me on the Way, and therefore, it is to be hoped, the good-natur'd Reader will more readily excuse its Blemishes. I have here added, by Way of Conclusion to the Notes, a short Hymn written (when very Young) in the great Epidemical Cold in 1732. An Hymn in Sickness. I O Lord! to Thee I lift my Soul, To Thee direct my Eyes, While Fate in every Vapour rolls, And sick'ning Nature sighs. II Ev'n Air, the Vehicle of Life, The soft Recess of Breath, Is made the Harbinger of Fate, And poison'd Dart of Death. III No gentle Strains relieve my Ears: But hark! the Passing-Toll, In a long, sadly-solemn Knell, Alarms anew my Soul. IV No lovely Prospect meets my Eye, But melancholy Fear, Attended with the hollow Pomp Of Sickness and Despair. V My Sins wide-staring in my Face In ghastly Guise alarm; The pleasing Sins of wanton Youth, In many a fatal Charm. VI I sink beneath their black Approach: My GOD! thy Mercy lend; Let Hope her healing Wings diffuse; O snatch me from the Fiend! VII I feel, I feel Thy saving Health: New Raptures fill my Heart: A shining Train of Bliss succeeds; The gloomy Scenes depart. VIII Tho' straining Coughs this mortal Frame To Dissolution bring, Yet dreary Death in vain affrights And points in vain his Sting: IX If gracious Heaven at that sad Hour Its guardian Arm extend; If Angels watch my parting Soul, And save me at my End. X O Lord, or let me live or die, Thy Holy Will be done! But let me live alone to Thee, And die in Thee alone. in plenteous flow, The Golden Oil effusing on my Head Of Gladness, let me ever sit and sing, Thy numerous Godhead sparkling in my Soul, Thyself instilling Praises, by thy Ear Not unapprov'd! For Wisdom's steady Ray, Th' enlight'ning Gift of Tongues, the sacred Fires Of Poesy are Thine; United Three! Father of Heav'n and Earth! Coæval Son! And co-existing Spirit! Trinal One! The End of the Fifth Book.</field>
