      <field name="fulltext">THE FELLOWSHIP OF HUMANITY This, and the six pieces following, are reprinted from Narcissus and other Poems. As one who, late at eve returning home Under the stars, hears on the common road A fellow-footstep fall, and sees one come Dimly, he knows not whom, nor can forebode; But cries to him, “God speed thee,” and is glad Hearing his restful answer through the night, And dreams of love, and though his heart be sad Feels darkly some strange instinct of delight: So I to thee. If on this earthly way Our paths had lain together, I perchance In the sweet sunlight had beheld thy day And known thee as thou art—as in a trance,— And loved thee, and thou me. But seeing now Sad night compels us, and our way is won Through ignorance and blindness to the brow Of that fair mountain of the morning Sun Whence Truth is manifest, let us remain In word and action strangers, yet in heart One and well known by every joy and pain That makes divine our little human part. LAMPS BEFORE DAWN I walk as one who, walking through the night From village unto village far withdrawn, Sees here and there a light and men who wake With confused murmur growing unto dawn. And suddenly the birds start into song, And cart-wheels creak along the flinty ways, And men are in the field, and lights are out, While the first sunbeam fills the air with praise. So louder, as I wander through the world, Sounds that glad anthem of the coming Day, And lamps of men that grope within the dark Flash quick and quicker through the morning grey, Ere they grow dim. O glance a thousand ways Through night-airs coldly wreathing round my brow, Ye heralds of a sun before whose face, The whiles ye fade, men hasten forth to bow! THE ARTIST TO HIS LADY I put my hands together palm to palm, And say: Take these; and, wheresoe'er thou wilt, Go—I will follow. For indeed I have No other life than this—to follow Thee. The Lady of my love is very fair; Often when morning rose above the rain She waved her white hand at the window-pane, And passed and mounted thro' the fields of air. I never saw her face or felt her smile— She seemed to pine among the haunts of men; Till at the last I left my city den, And followed in her footsteps for a while. She led me where the light shines freely down, She set me by the river-fringes green, And turned herself; and in her face, I ween, The glories of all worlds to me were shown. Her radiant front is not of mortal mould, Her look is of the lands which are not seen, Broad is her brow, somewhat austere her mien, Yet magical her beauty to behold. For all the friendless way hedged with offence, For all the hours forsaken of her face, Now to behold in peace her peerless grace Is and remains my perfect recompense. THE SLEEPING VENUS Still, as she sleeps, betwixt her slender brows The calm of summer and dim twilight dwells; Day's faint vermilion, clear with evening bells, Fitfully on her sleep-flushed temple glows. Her lips, like rosy lovers loth to part, Make scanty room between them for her breath; About their wavy outline wandereth A smile as sweet as when swift sunbeams dart This way and that upon a windless lake That ripples roundly ere it sinks to rest; And to that smile the smooth curves of her breast And flowing limbs delightful answer make. O'er all that placid world of hill and dale Night from her down-curved eyelids slowly draws The fragrant gloom of sleep, that overawes And folds the waking senses in a veil. White shines her forehead as when moon-rays gleam Blue-veined against the crystal vault of heaven, Her slumbrous hair in languid tresses woven Forebodes the rapture of Love's timeless dream. A LOCOMOTIVE With a rush and a roar, thro' the wind and the rain, I flash in the light and vanish again, Where dim to the passenger through the wet pane A wayside station appears. 'Tis night: all is silent and still. With a scream I waken the signalman out of his dream; And his lamps like the flash of a meteor seem To the passenger wight as he peers. Then forward, with flaming front and a bound, I leap on the dark and devour the ground, And the night recedes before and around, And closes upon me behind; Where, caught in a terrible whirlwind of wheels, The earth falls dizzily backward and reels And rises in clouds of dust on my heels, With dead leaves blown on the wind. On, into the night, through echoing arch And loud resounding tunnel I march; By misty forests of fir and larch, And over the wind-swept ridge; And the passenger-mortal, as morning appears, Half wakes in a world of indefinite fears And drowsily falls back asleep as he hears The sound of my feet on the bridge. A thousand shocks are shattered to one As over the resonant metals I run With a storm of sounds enough to stun The ears of a marble bust. A swerve, a slip, and that slender life Is shorn asunder as with a sharp knife, Or battered from knowledge of brother or wife, And cast away in the dust. Yet I am not I to will this thing, But man arose like a masterful king, Put fire for my heart, a wheel for wing, And breathed his breath in my mouth; And bade me hurry at his behest With eager feet forgetful of rest To bear him for ever from East to West, To bear him from North to South. So whenever I faint, or falter, or tire, I feel and know in my heart the fire Of man my master's fierce desire Impels me forward again. Let him cling to me now as best he can, But blame me not if I be his ban, For since I was made the servant of Man I am unmindful of men. GENOA Where Genoa spreads her white arms crescent-wise, Her feet o'er well-packed bale and polished spar Step on the quay with men of every star. Her heart stays with her people; but her eyes From those high garden-terraces devise New realms of peaceful conquest, where afar Ocean's white horses at the harbour bar Wait ever for their rider to arise. Here boy Columbus stood, and o'er the blue Immeasurable fields imagined new. Here young Mazzini, while for men he yearned, Another world within their eyes discerned— The one Republic without place or date. So both for men lived,—and died execrate. BEETHOVEN Betwixt the actual and unseen, alone, Companionless, deaf, in dread solitude Of soul amid the faithless multitude, He lived, and fought with life, and held his own; Knew poverty, and shame which is not shown, Pride, doubt, and secret heart-despair of good,— Insolent praise of men and petty feud; Yet fell not from his purpose, framed and known. For as a lonely watcher of the night, When all men sleep, sees the tumultuous stars Move forward from the deep in squadrons bright, And notes them, he through this life's prison bars Heard all night long the spheric music clear Beat on his heart,—and lived that men might hear. THE FOOTPATH Out at the doorway with shrill delight Ringing, clear of alloy, After a butterfly flashing so white As it wheels and floats in the soft sunlight, He darts, O adventurous joy! Away! the fields are waving, the wheat Stands proudly over the path, The path winds onward, winning his feet Through avenues arched and shady and sweet,— Sweet vista that childhood hath. But stay: the butterfly has upflown High in the stainless blue; Under the shadowing wheat, alone, He stands and wonders, still as a stone, For all the world is new. He sees each beautiful stem, blue-green, Standing alone in its grace, Great pendulous poppies aflame between, And lithe convolvulus climbing to screen That dim forest-world from his face. He sees overhead as they dance to its tune The ears flash white in the wind, But that musical laugh before mid-noon Ripples far and faint in the heat, and soon Leaves silence only behind. And the silence falls on his fresh young soul Like the far sound of the sea, Infinite, solemn; its strange control Possesses him quite; quick fancies roll Through his brain; half fearfully He looks; and the long path seems to strain His tremulous lips apart; Some sudden trouble his eyes sustain; For so the folded blossom of pain Has broke in his childish heart. What is it?—some swift intuitive glance, Half-shapen only in thought, Of stranger worlds, of wide mischance? Some intimate sense of severance Or loss?—I know not what. He turns and leaps; for his mother's arms Out of the doorway lean; She folds him safely from all alarms, And rallies his courage with rhythmical charms,— Yet knows not what he has seen. GOING TO SCHOOL Beside the cottage door, she sees The white sheep in the sun; The old Church-gable thro' the trees Breaks with the bounding of the breeze— Cloud-shadows o'er it run. Upward the green hill-slope they go— Cloud-shadow, shadow and cloud; Kiss on the height and hasten so Down heaven's blue galleries below— Cloud, cloud-shadow and cloud. The brown bee buzzes at the door, The lilies shine like fire, And overhead the lark will soar And toss his sweet song evermore Higher, and ever higher. Rich marigolds, star-thick, arise Out of the warm wet earth, Gaze, orange-gold, up azure skies, Like beacon-flames for butterflies Half-blind in honeyed mirth. She sees it all with open eye, Absorbed in dream-world wonder; Looks, childlike, o'er the tree-tops high, And smiles—she has not learnt to sigh— Then comes the distant Thunder! Quick as a squirrel she slips her book Into her satchel brown, Smoothes fair her frock to get a look At tiny feet that said they took To heart her solemn frown; Then, unforgetful evermore Of hill and cloud and valley, Hastens, the thunderstorm before, Hot-cheeked at its rebukeful roar, All down a dark yew-alley. CUPID BELIES HIS OWN FAREWELL Hard by the mountain springs I heard a dove Wail long, wail loud, her passionate complaint, And looking saw the tender God of love Trip past with arrows sheathed and bow unbent. Quickly I caught and drew him to my side. He spake no word, but looked into my face With childish eyes of wonder opened wide, And innocent half-hesitating grace. I thought him bashful or myself to blame For rougher years, and knelt like one denied, And kissed his brow and called him by his name; But he no syllable to all replied. Then did I fling in petulant despair A flowery handful at him with: “Away!”— “Farewell,” he said—and with a smile so fair, It rankles in my heart unto this day! EYES, SAD AND SWEET Sad eyes, some say because you are so sweet Love carols like a lark in your blue heaven, And flashes forth in song, and soars to meet The morning sun what time the mists are riven. Some say, dear eyes, because you are so bright Fanciful lightnings thrill whoe'er you greet, Your splendour pierces with faint pain, your light Consumes like fire, because you are so sweet. Sweet eyes! I say because you are so sad You touch us thro' the heart of all our sorrow, Transforming grief to music, and the mad Processions of despair men call “to-morrow” Into a heaven of hopes that lightly throng Like birds thro' the far winter of our tears, Waking the gloomy woodlands into song And brushing with their wings the windless meres. TO THE UNKNOWN GOD Out of all hours of woe, Weary at heart, Worn with life-orisons, lonely, apart, Still unto Thee we go, Thou whom we fain would know, Cry unto Thee without end, without art. Out of the clouds that roll Round us, above, Still we stretch obstinate arms for Thy love: Loud though the tempest toll, Love, cries the wilful soul, Broods silver-winged o'er the waste like a dove. TO THE MUSE OF MEASURED VERSE On the Occasion of Adopting New Forms O Muse, I said, your tenderest refrain (Muse of soft lullaby and lispéd rhyme) Sing for my farewell song, who from this time Must steer my bark upon a stormier main. My sail is set. I know not if again Under your shoreward boughs in Spring's sweet prime I'll glide, or dream to the soft rippling chime The calm struck from my keel. Henceforth I strain My lyre to Life's profounder diapason: The rhythm of ocean-waves o'erruns my strings— Of waves which over harbour-wall and bason The flooding tide inevitably flings; On whose high crests new-freighted vessels hasten To music of the wind's tempestuous wings. THE SMITH AND THE KING A smith upon a summer's day Did call upon a King; The King exclaimed, “The Queen's away, Can I do anything?” “I pray you can,” the Smith replied; “I want a bit of bread.” “Why?” cried the King. The fellow sighed: “I'm hungry, sire,” he said. “Dear me! I'll call my Chancellor, He understands such things; Your claims I cannot cancel, or Deem them fit themes for kings.” “Sir Chancellor, why here's a wretch Starving—like rats or mice!” The Chancellor replied, “I'll fetch The First Lord in a trice.” The First Lord came, and by his look You might have guessed he'd shirk; Said he, “Your Majesty's mistook, This is the Chief Clerk's work.” The Chief Clerk said the case was bad, But quite beyond his power, Seeing it was the Steward had The keys of cake and flour. The Steward wept; “The keys I've lost,” Said he; “but in a span I'll call the Smith. Why, Holy Ghost! Here is the very man.” “Hurrah! hurrah!” they loudly cried, “How cleverly we've done it! We've solved this question deep and wide, Well nigh ere we'd begun it.” “Thanks!” said the Smith; “O fools and vile: Go moulder on the shelf! The next time I am starving I'll Take care to help myself.” ENGLAND, ARISE! England, arise! The long long night is over, Faint in the east behold the dawn appear; Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow Arise, O England, for the day is here. From your fields and hills Hark! the answer swells: Arise, O England, for the day is here. Long, long have been the anguish and the labour, Dark, dark the clouds of unbelief unrolled, Dreadful the night when no man trusted neighbour, Shameful the nightmare-greed of gain and gold; Yet from fields and hills Hark! the song now swells: Arise, O England, for the day is here. By your young children's eyes so red with weeping, By their white faces aged with want and fear, By the dark cities where your babes are creeping Naked of joy and all that makes life dear; From your wretched slums A voice of pity comes: Arise, O England, for the day is here. By all your workshops where men sweat and sicken, Foredone to death, in toil and hope deferred, Where cheeks are flushed and pulses start and quicken, Not with glad life but by dark hatred stirred; From each bench and forge A sound comes like a surge: Arise, O England, for the day is here. By your high homes of wealth and wasteful living, By your rich tables piled, without good cheer, By the ennui, ill-health, and sickly striving— Not great to be, but only to appear; O'er the weary throng Strangely floats the song: Arise, O England, for the day is here. By your rich orchards, lands of corn and pasture, Where all day long the voice of joy should ring, Now mute and desert, by land-grabbers wasted, Robbed of the love the peasant longs to bring; From the stricken land Hark! the words ascend: Arise, O England, for the day is here. People of England, all your valleys call you, High in the rising sun the lark sings clear; Will you dream on, let shameful slumber thrall you? Will you disown your native land so dear? Shall it die unheard— That sweet pleading word? Arise, O England, for the day is here. Over your face a web of lies is woven, Law that are falsehoods pin you to the ground; Labour is mocked, its just reward is stolen, On its bent back sits Idleness encrowned; How long, while you sleep, Your harvest shall it reap? Arise, O England, for the day is here. Out of your ruin rich men thrive and fatten, Your merchants rub their hands when food is dear, Capital says your claims are not forgotten If wages keep you just starvation-clear; People of England, when Will ye rise like men? Rise and be freemen, for the day is here! Hear, England, hear! Deliverance is within you; Though like a man whom death is very near, Though sick the head, the whole heart faint within you, Dare to be true!—and even from the bier Where your body lies A new life shall arise, England shall rise again to life sincere. Yet thus I warn you: long shall be the struggle, Not one but many men in it shall die; This cancerous disease and devil's juggle Shall not pass in the twinkling of an eye; To undo their wrong The people shall strive long: O that they fail not! for the day is here. Forth then, ye heroes, patriots and lovers! Comrades of danger, poverty and scorn! Mighty in faith of Freedom, your great Mother, Giants refreshed in joy's new-rising morn! Come and swell the song Silent now so long— England is risen and the Day is here!</field>
