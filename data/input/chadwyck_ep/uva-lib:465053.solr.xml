      <field name="fulltext">JUVENILIA To His Sacred Majesty. Vertues triumphant Shrine! who do'st engage At once three Kingdomes in a Pilgrimage; Which in extatick duty strive to come Out of themselves as well as from their home: Whilst England grows one Camp, and London is It self the Nation, not Metropolis; And loyall Kent renews her Arts agen, Fencing her wayes with moving groves of men; Forgive this distant homage, which doth meet Your blest approach on Sedentary feet: And though my youth, not patient yet to bear The weight of Armes, denies me to appear In Steel before You, yet, Great Sir, approve My manly wishes, and more vigorous love; In whom a cold respect were treason to A Fathers ashes, greater than to you; Whose one ambition 'tis for to be known By daring Loyalty Your WILMOT's Son. To Her Sacred Majesty the Queen Mother Respite great Queen your just and hasty fears, Ther's no infection lodges in our teares. Though our unhappy aire be arm'd with death, Yet sigh's have an untainted guiltlesse breath. O! stay a while, and teach your equall skill To understand and to support our ill. You that in mighty wrongs an Age have spent, And seem to have out-liv'd even bannishment: Whom traiterous mischeif sought its earliest prey, When unto sacred blood it made its way; And thereby did its black designe impart, To take his head, that wounded first his heart: You that unmov'd great Charles his ruine stood, When that three Nations sunk beneath the load: Then a young Daughter lost, yet balsome found To stanch that new and freshly bleeding wound: And after this with fixt and steddy eyes Beheld your noble Glocesters obsequies: And then sustain'd the royall Princess fall; You only can lament her Funerall. But you will hence remove, and leave behind Our sad complaints lost in the empty wind; Those winds that bid you stay, and loudly rore Destruction, and drive back unto the Shore: Shipwrack to safety, and the envy fly Of sharing in this Scene of Tragedy: Whilst sickness from whose rage you post away Relents, and only now contrives your stay: The lately fatall and infectious ill Courts the fair Princesse and forgets to kill. In vain on feavors curses we dispence, And vent our passions angry eloquence: In vain we blast the Ministers of Fate, And the forlorne Physitians imprecate, Say they to death new poisons adde and fire; Murder securely for reward and hire; Arts Basilicks, that kill whom ere they see, And truly write bills of Mortality; Who least the bleeding Corps should them betray, First draine those vitall speaking streames away. And will you by your flight take part with these? Become your self a third and new disease? If they have caus'd our losse, then so have you, Who take your self and the fair Princesse too: For we depriv'd, an equall damage have When France doth ravish hence as when the grave. But that your choice th'unkindness doth improve, And dereliction adds unto remove.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LOVE POEMS A Pastoral Dialogue BETWEEN ALEXIS and STREPHON. Alex. There sighs not on the Plain So lost a Swain as I; Scorcht't up with Love, frozen with Disdain. Of killing Sweetness I complain. Streph. If 'tis Corinna, die. II Since first my dazled Eyes were thrown On that bewitching Face, Like ruin'd Birds, rob'd of their Young, Lamenting, frighted, and alone, I fly from place to place. III Fram'd by some Cruel Powers above, So nice she is, and fair; None from undoing can remove, Since all, who are not Blind, must Love; Who are not vain, Despair. Alex. The Gods no sooner give a Grace, But fond of their own Art, Severely jealous, ever place To guard the Glories of a Face, A Dragon in the Heart. V Proud and ill-natur'd Powers they are, Who peevish to Mankind, For their own Honour's sake, with Care, Make a sweet Form divinely Fair, And add a Cruel Mind. Streph. Since she's insensible of Love, By Honour taught to hate, If we, forc'd by Decrees above, Must sensible to Beauty prove, How Tyrannous is Fate? Alex. I to the Nymph have never nam'd The Cause of all my pain. Streph. Such Bashfulness may well be blam'd; For since to serve we're not asham'd, Why should she blush to Reign? Alex. But if her haughty Heart despise My humble proffer'd One, The just Compassion she denies, I may obtain from other's Eyes; Hers are not Fair alone. IX Devouring Flames require new Food; My Heart's consum'd almost: New Fires must kindle in her Blood, Or Mine go out, and that's as good. Streph. Would'st live, when Love is lost? X Be dead before thy Passion dies; For if thou should'st survive, What Anguish would the Heart surprize, To see her Flames begin to rise, And Thine no more Alive. Alex. Rather what Pleasure shou'd I meet In my Tryumphant scorn, To see my Tyrant at my Feet; Whil'st taught by her, unmov'd I sit A Tyrant in my Turn. Streph. Ungentle Shepherd, cease for shame; Which way can you pretend To merit so Divine a Flame, Who to dull Life make a mean Claim, When Love is at an End? XIII As Trees are by their Bark embrac'd, Love to my Soul doth cling; When torn by th'Herd's greedy Taste, The injur'd Plants feel they're defac't, They wither in the Spring. XIV My rifled Love would soon retire, Dissolving into Aire, Shou'd I that Nymph cease to admire, Blest in whose Arms I will expire, Or at her Feet despair. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN Strephon and Daphne. Strephon. Prithee now, fond Fool, give o're; Since my heart is gone before, To what purpose shou'd I stay? Love Commands another way. Daphne. Perjur'd Swain, I knew the time When Dissembling was your Crime. In pity now employ that Art Which first betray'd, to ease my heart. Strephon. Women can with pleasure feign: Men dissemble still with pain. What advantage will it prove If I lye, who cannot love? Daphne. Tell me then the Reason why, Love from Hearts in love does flye? Why the Bird will build a Nest, Where he ne're intends to rest? Strephon. Love, like other little Boys, Cries for Hearts, as they for Toys: Which, when gain'd, in Childish Play, Wantonly are thrown away. Daphne. Still on Wing, or on his Knees, Love does nothing by degrees: Basely flying when most priz'd, Meanly fawning when despis'd. Flattering or insulting ever, Generous and grateful never: All his Joys are fleeting Dreams, All his Woes severe Extreams. Strephon. Nimph, unjustly you inveigh; Love, like us, must Fate obey. Since 'tis Nature's Law to Change, Constancy alone is strange. See the Heav'ns in Lightnings break, Next in Storms of Thunder speak; Till a kind Rain from above Makes a Calm—so 'tis in love. Flames begin our first Address, Like meeting Thunder we embrace: Then you know the Show'rs that fall Quench the fire, and quiet all. Daphne. How shou'd I these Show'rs forget, 'Twas so pleasant to be wet; They kill'd Love, I knew it well, I dy'd all the while they fell. Say at least what Nimph it is Robs my Breast of so much Bliss? If she is fair I shall be eas'd, Thro' my Ruine you'll be pleas'd. Strephon. Daphne never was so fair: Strephon, scarcely, so sincere. Gentle, Innocent, and Free, Ever pleas'd with only me. Many Charms my Heart enthral, But there's one above 'em all: With aversion she does flye Tedious, trading, Constancy. Daphne. Cruel Shepherd! I submit; Do what Love and you think fit: Change is Fate, and not Design, Say you wou'd have still been mine. Strephon. Nymph, I cannot: 'tis too true, Change has greater Charms than you. Be, by my Example, wise, Faith to Pleasure sacrifice. Daphne. Silly Swain, I'll have you know, 'Twas my practice long ago: Whilst you Vainly thought me true, I was false in scorn of you. By my Tears, my Heart's disguise, I thy Love and thee despise. Woman-kind more Joy discovers Making Fools, than keeping Lovers. The Discovery. Celia, the faithful servant you disown, Wou'd in obedience keep his Love unknown; But bright Idea's such as you inspire, We can no more conceal, than not admire; My heart at home, in my own brest did dwell, Like humble Hermit in a peaceful Cell, Unknown, and undisturb'd, it rested there, Stranger alike to Hope, and to Despair: But Loves Tumultuous Train does now invade The Sacred quiet of this Hallow'd Shade; His fatal flames shine out to every eye, Like blazing Comets in a Winters Sky. Fair and severe like Heaven you injoyn, Commands that seems cross to your own design; Forbidding what your selves incline us to: Since if from Heavenly Powers you will allow, That all our faculty proceed; 'tis plain, What 'ere we will, is what the Gods ordain; But they and you, Rights without Limit have, Over your Creatures, and (more yours) your slave: And I am one, born only to admire, Too humble 'ere to hope, scarce to desire, A thing whose bliss depends upon your will; Who wou'd be proud, you'd deign to use him ill. How can my passion merit your offence, That challenges so little recompence? Let me but ever love, and ever be The example of your power and cruelty; Since so much scorn does in your brest reside, Be more indulgent to its Mother, Pride; Kill all you strike, and trample on their Graves, But own the Fates of your neglected Slaves: When in the crowd yours undistinguish'd lyes, You give away the Tryumph of your Eyes: Permit me then to glory in my Chains, My fruitless Sighs, and my unpitied Pains: Perhaps obtaining this, you'l think I find More Mercy than your Anger has design'd; But Love has carefully contriv'd for me, The last perfection of Misery: For to my State those hopes of Common peace, Which Death affords to every Wretch, must cease; My worst of Fates attends me in my Grave, Since, dying, I must be no more your Slave. The Advice. All things submit themselves to your command, Fair Celia, when it does not Love withstand; The power it borrows from your eyes alone, All but the God must yield to who has none; Were he not blind, such are the Charmes you have, He'd quit his Godhead to become your Slave. Be proud to act a Mortal Heroes part, And throw himself for Fame on his own Dart; But Fate hath otherwise dispos'd of things, In different Bonds subjecting Slaves, and Kings. Fetter'd in Forms of Royal State are they, While we enjoy the Freedom to Obey. That Fate (like you resistless) does ordain That Love alone should over Beauty Reign. By Harmony the Universe does move; And what is Harmony, but mutual Love? See gentle Brooks, how quietly they glide, Kissing the rugged Banks on either side, Whil'st in their Christal Stream at once they show, And with them feed the Flowers which they bestow; Though prest upon by their too rude embrace, In gentle murmurs they keep on their pace To their Lov'd Sea; for even streams have desires, Cool as they are, they feel Love's pow'rful fires: And with such passion, that if any force Stop or molest 'um in their Am'rous course, They swell with rage, break down, and ravage ore The Banks they kiss'd, the flowers they fed before. Who would resist an Empire so Divine, Which Universal Nature does enjoyn? Submit then Celia e're you be reduc'd, For Rebels vanquisht once, are vilely us'd. And such are you, when e're you dare obey Another passion, and your Love betray. You are Loves Citadels, by you he reigns, And his proud Empire o're the World maintains; He trusts you with his Stratagems and Arms, His frowns, his smiles, and all his conquering charms. Beauty's no more but the dead Soyl which Love Mannures, and does by wise Commerce improve; Sayling by Sighes through Seas of tears, he sends, Courtship from Forraign hearts: For your own ends Cherish the Trade; for as with Indians we Get Gold and Jewels for our Trumpery, So to each other for their useless Toyes, Lovers afford whole Magazins of Joyes: But if youe're fond of Bawbles, be, and starve, Your Gugaw Reputation preserve; Live upon Modesty and empty Fame, Forgoing Sense, for a Fantastick Name. [[Could I but make my wishes insolent]] Could I but make my wishes insolent And force some image of a false content? But they like mee bashfull and humble growne Hover att distance about Beautyes throne There worship and admire and then they dye Daring noe more Lay Hold of her than I. Reason to worth beares a submissive spirritt But Fooles can bee familliar with merritt. Who but that Blundring blockhead Phaeton Could e're have thought to drive about the Sun. Just such another durst make Love to you Whom not ambition led but dullness drew, Noe Am'rous thought would his dull heart incline But he would have a passion, for 'twas fine That, a new suite, and what hee next must say, Runs in his Idle head the live Long day. Hard hearted saint, since 'tis your will to Bee Soe unrelenting pittiless to mee Regardless of A Love soe many yeares Preserv'd twix't Lingring hopes and awfull feares Such feares in Lovers Breasts high vallue claimes And such expiring martyrs feele in flames. My hopes your selfe contriv'd with cruell care Through gentle smiles to leade mee to despaire, Tis some releife in my extreame distress My rivall is Below your power to Bless. The submission. To this moment a Rebell I throw down my Arms Great Love at first sight of Olindas bright Charms Made prowd and secure by such forces as these You may now be a Tyrant as soon as you please. When Innocence, Beauty, and witt doe Conspire, To betray, and engage, and enflame my Desire, Why should I decline what I cannott avoyd And let pleaseing hope by base fear be destroy'd. Her Innocence cannott contrive to undoe me, Her beauties enclin'd, or why should it pursue me, And witt has to pleasure been ever a Freind, Then what Roome for dispair since delight is Loves end. There can be no danger in sweetness and youth Where Love is secur'd by Good nature and Truth On her beauty I'le gaze, and of pleasure Complain, While every kind look adds a link to my Chain. 'Tis more to maintaine, then it was to surprise, But her witt leads in Triumph the slave of her eies— I beheld with the losse of my freedome before But heareing for ever must serve and adore. Too bright is my Goddess; her Temple too weak Retire Divine Image I feel my heart break Help Love I dissolve in a Rapture of Charms At the thought of those Joyes I should meet in her Arms. Grecian KINDNESS. A SONG. I The outmost Grace the Greeks could shew, When to the Trojans they grew kind, Was with their Arms to let 'em go, And leave their lingring Wives behind. They beat the Men, and burnt the Town, Then all the Baggage was their own. 2 There the kind Deity of Wine Kiss'd the soft wanton God of Love; This clapt his Wings, that press'd his Vine, And their best Pow'rs united move. While each brave Greek embrac'd his Punk, Lull'd her asleep, and then grew drunk. To Corinna. A SONG. 1 What Cruel pains Corinna takes, To force that harmless frown: When not one Charm her Face forsakes, Love cannot lose his own. 2 So sweet a Face, so soft a Heart, Such Eyes so very kind, Betray, alas! the silly Art Virtue had ill design'd. 3 Poor feeble Tyrant! who in vain Would proudly take upon her, Against kind Nature to maintain Affected Rules of Honour. 4 The Scorn she bears so helpless proves, When I plead Passion to her, That much she fears, (but more she loves,) Her Vassal should undo her. Song. [Give me leave to raile at you] Give me leave to raile at you, I aske nothing but my due; To call you false, and then to say, You shall not keepe my Heart a Day. But (Alas!) against my will, I must be your Captive still. Ah! be kinder then, for I, Cannot change, and wou'd not dye. Kindnesse has resistlesse Charmes, All besides but weakly move, Fiercest Anger it disarmes, And Clips the Wings of flying Love. Beauty does the Heart invade, Kindnesse only can perswade; It guilds the Lovers Servile Chaine And makes the Slave grow pleas'd and vaine. The Answer. [by Lady Rochester] Nothing adds to your fond fire, More than Scorne, and cold disdaine, I to cherish your desire, Kindnesse us'd, but 'twas in vaine. You insulted on your Slave, Humble Love you soone refus'd Hope not then a Pow'r to have Which Ingloriously you us'd. Thinke not Thirsis I will e're By my Love, my Empire loose, You grow Constant through despair, Love return'd, you wou'd abuse. Tho' you still possesse my heart, Scorne, and Rigour, I must feigne, Ah! forgive that only Art, Love, has left your Love to gaine. You that cou'd my Heart subdue; To new Conquests, ne're pretend, Let your Example make me true And of a Conquer'd Foe, a Friend. Then if e're I shou'd complaine, Of your Empire, or my Chain, Summon all your Pow'rfull Charmes, And fell the Rebell in your Armes. Song [Att Last you'l force mee to confess] Att Last you'l force mee to confess You need noe arts to vanquish Such charmes from Nature you posses 'Twere dullness, nott to Languish; Yett spare A heart you may surprize And give my Tongue the glory To scorne, while my unfaithfull eyes Betray a kinder story. [[Another version] ] [Too late, alas! I must confess] Too late, alas! I must confess You need no Arts to move me: Such Charms by Nature you posses, 'Twere madness not to love you. Then spare a Heart you may surprise, And give my Tongue the Glory To boast, tho' my unfaithful Eyes Betray a kinder Story. Womans Honor. Love, bad me hope, and I obey'd, Phillis continu'd still unkind, Then you may e'ne despair he said, In vain I strive to change her Mind. Honor's got in, and keeps her Heart; Durst he but venture once abroad, In my own right I'd take your part, And shew my self the mightier God. This huffing Honour domineers, In Breasts alone, where he has place; But if true gen'rous Love appears, The Hector dares not shew his Face. Let me still languish and complain, Be most unhumanly deny'd, I have some pleasure in my pain, She can have none with all her Pride. I fall a Sacrifice to Love, She lives a Wretch for Honours sake, Whose Tyrant does most cruel prove, The diff'rence is not hard to make. Consider reall Honour then, You'll find hers cannot be the same, 'Tis Noble confidence in Men, In Women, mean mistrustful shame. The Platonick Lady I could Love thee 'till I dye, Wouldst Thou Love mee Modestly; And ne're presse, whilst I love, For more than willingly I would give; Which should sufficient be to prove I'de understand the Arte of Love. I hate the Thing is call'd Injoyment, Besydes it is a dull imployment, It cutts off all that's Life and fier, From that which may be term'd Desire. Just (like the Be) whose sting is gon, Converts the owner to a Droane. I love a youth, will give mee leave His Body in my arms to wreath; To presse him Gently and to kisse, To sigh and looke with Eyes that wish. For what if I could once Obtaine, I would neglect with flatt disdaine. I'de give him Liberty to toye, And play with mee and count it Joye. Our freedom should be full compleate, And nothing wanting but the feate: Let's practice then, and we shall prove, These are the only sweets of Love— Verses put into a Lady's Prayer-book. Fling this useless Book away, And presume no more to Pray; Heav'n is just, and can bestow Mercy on none but those that Mercy show. With a proud Heart maliciously inclin'd Not to encrease, but to subdue Mankind. In vain you vex the Gods with your Petition; Without Repentance and sincere Contrition, You're in a Reprobate Condition. Phillis, to calm the angry Powers, And save my Soul as well as yours, Relieve poor Mortals from Despair, And justifie the Gods that made you fair; And in those bright and charming Eyes Let Pity first appear, then Love; That we by easie steps may rise Through all the Joys on Earth, to those Above. Song. [Love a Woman! y'are an Ass] Love a Woman! y'are an Ass, 'Tis a most insipid Passion, To choose out for your happiness The idlest part of Gods Creation! Let the Porter, and the Groome, Things design'd for dirty Slaves, Drudge in fair Aurelias Womb, To get supplies for Age, and Graves. Farewel Woman, I intend, Henceforth, ev'ry Night to sit, With my lewd well natur'd Friend, Drinking, to engender Wit. Then give me Health, Wealth, Mirth, and Wine, And if busie Love, intrenches, There's a sweet soft Page, of mine, Does the trick worth Forty Wenches. [[Leave this gawdy guilded Stage]] Leave this gawdy guilded Stage From custome more than use frequented Where fooles of either sex and age Crowd to see themselves presented. To loves Theatre the Bed Youth and beauty fly together And Act soe well it may be said The Lawrell there was due to either. Twixt strifes of Love and war the difference Lies in this When neither overcomes Loves triumph greater is. Sab: Lost Shee yeilds, she yeilds, Pale Envy said Amen The first of woemen to the Last of men. Just soe those frailer beings Angells fell Ther's noe mid way (it seemes) twix't heav'n and hell, Was it your end in making her, to show Things must bee rais'd soe high to fall soe low? Since her nor Angells their owne worth secures Looke to it gods! the next turne must bee yours You who in careles scorne Laught att the wayes Of Humble Love and call'd 'em rude Essayes Could you submitt to Lett this Heavy thing Artless and wittless, noe way merriting The Fall. How blest was the Created State Of Man and Woman, e're they fell, Compar'd to our unhappy ffate! We need not fear another Hell: Naked beneath cool Shades they lay, Enjoyment waited on desire; Each member did their wills obey: Nor could a wish set pleasure higher. But we, poor Slaves to hope and fear, Are never of our Joys secure: They lessen still, as they draw near; And none but dull delights endure. Then, Cloris, while I duty pay, The nobler Tribute of a heart; Be not you so severe, to say You Love me for a frailer part. [[T'was a dispute]] T'was a dispute 'twixt heav'n and Earth Which had produc't the Nobler birth: For Heav'n, Appear'd Cynthya with all her Trayne Till you came forth More glorious and more Worth, Than shee with all those trembling imps of Light With which This Envious Queene of night Had Proudly deck't her Conquer'd selfe in Vaine. I must have perrish't in that first surprize Had I beheld your Eyes; Love Like Appollo when he would inspire Some holy brest, laide all his gloryes by. Els The God cloath'd in his heavnly fire Would have possest too powerfully And making of his Preist A sacrifize Had soe return'd unhallow'd to the Skyes. A SONG. [Insulting Beauty, you mispend] Insulting Beauty, you mispend Those Frowns upon your Slave; Your Scorn against such Rebels bend, Who dare with confidence pretend, That other Eyes their Hearts defend, From all the Charms you have. Your conquering Eyes so partial are, Or Mankind is so dull, That while I languish in Despair, Many proud senseless Hearts declare, They find you not so killing Fair, To wish you merciful. They an Inglorious Freedom boast; I triumph in my Chain; Nor am I unreveng'd, though lost; Nor you unpunish'd, though unjust, When I alone, who love you most, Am kill'd with your Disdain. A SONG. [Injurious Charmer of my vanquisht Heart] Nymph. Injurious Charmer of my vanquisht Heart, Canst thou feel Love, and yet no pity know? Since of my self from thee I cannot part, Invent some gentle Way to let me go. For what with Joy thou didst obtain, And I with more did give; In time will make thee false and vain, And me unfit to live. Shepherd. Frail Angel, that wou'dst leave a Heart forlorn, With vain pretence falshood therein might lye; Seek not to cast wild shadows o're your scorn, You cannot sooner change than I can dye. To tedious life I'le never fall, Thrown from thy dear lov'd Breast; He merits not to live at all, Who cares to live unblest. Chor. Then let our flaming Hearts be joyn'd, While in that sacred fire; Ere thou prove false, or I unkind, Together both expire. The MISTRESS. A SONG. 1 An Age in her Embraces past, Would seem a Winters day; Where Life and Light, with envious hast, Are torn and snatch'd away. 2 But, oh how slowly Minutes rowl, When absent from her Eyes That feed my Love, which is my Soul, It languishes and dyes. 3 For then no more a Soul but shade, It mournfully does move; And haunts my Breast, by absence made The living Tomb of Love. 4 You Wiser men despise me not; Whose Love-sick Fancy raves, On Shades of Souls, and Heaven knows what; Short Ages live in Graves. 5 When e're those wounding Eyes, so full Of Sweetness, you did see; Had you not been profoundly dull, You had gone mad like me. 6 Nor Censure us You who perceive My best belov'd and me, Sigh and lament, Complain and grieve, You think we disagree. 7 Alas! 'tis Sacred Jealousie, Love rais'd to an Extream; The only Proof 'twixt her and me, We love, and do not dream. 8 Fantastick Fancies fondly move; And in frail Joys believe: Taking false Pleasure for true Love; But Pain can ne're deceive. 9 Kind Jealous Doubts, tormenting Fears, And Anxious Cares, when past; Prove our Hearts Treasure fixt and dear, And make us blest at last. The Imperfect Enjoyment. Naked she lay, claspt in my longing Arms, I fill'd with Love, and she all over charms, Both equally inspir'd with eager fire, Melting through kindness, flaming in desire; With Arms, Legs, Lips, close clinging to embrace, She clips me to her Breast, and sucks me to her Face. The nimble Tongue (Love's lesser Lightning) plaid Within my Mouth, and to my thoughts conveyd Swift Orders, that I shou'd prepare to throw, The All-dissolving Thunderbolt below. My flutt'ring Soul, sprung with the pointed kiss, Hangs hov'ring o're her Balmy Brinks of Bliss. But whilst her busie hand, wou'd guide that part, Which shou'd convey my Soul up to her Heart, In liquid Raptures, I dissolve all o're, Melt into Sperme, and spend at ev'ry Pore: A touch from any part of her had don't, Her Hand, her Foot, her very look's a Cunt. Smiling, she chides in a kind murm'ring Noise, And from her Body wipes the clammy joys; When with a Thousand Kisses, wand'ring o're My panting Bosome,—is there then no more? She cries. All this to Love, and Rapture's due, Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too? But I the most forlorn, lost Man alive, To shew my wisht Obedience vainly strive, I sigh alas! and Kiss, but cannot Swive. Eager desires, confound my first intent, Succeeding shame, does more success prevent, And Rage, at last, confirms me impotent. Ev'n her fair Hand, which might bid heat return To frozen Age, and make cold Hermits burn, Apply'd to my dead Cinder, warms no more, Than Fire to Ashes, cou'd past Flames restore. Trembling, confus'd, despairing, limber, dry, A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I ly. This Dart of love, whose piercing point oft try'd, With Virgin blood, Ten thousand Maids has dy'd; Which Nature still directed with such Art, That it through ev'ry Cunt, reacht ev'ry Heart. Stiffly resolv'd, twou'd carelesly invade, Woman or Man, nor ought its fury staid, Where e're it pierc'd, a Cunt it found or made. Now languid lies, in this unhappy hour, Shrunk up, and Sapless, like a wither'd Flow'r. Thou treacherous, base, deserter of my flame, False to my passion, fatal to my Fame; Through what mistaken Magick dost thou prove, So true to lewdness, so untrue to Love? What Oyster, Cinder, Beggar, common Whore, Didst thou e're fail in all thy Life before? When Vice, Disease and Scandal lead the way, With what officious hast dost thou obey? Like a Rude roaring Hector, in the Streets, That Scuffles, Cuffs, and Ruffles all he meets; But if his King, or Country, claim his Aid, The Rakehell Villain, shrinks, and hides his head: Ev'n so thy Brutal Valor, is displaid, Breaks ev'ry Stew, does each small Whore invade, But when great Love, the onset does command, Base Recreant, to thy Prince, thou darst not stand. Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most, Through all the Town, a common Fucking Post; On whom each Whore, relieves her tingling Cunt, As Hogs, on Gates, do rub themselves and grunt. May'st thou to rav'nous Shankers, be a Prey, Or in consuming Weepings waste away. May Strangury, and Stone, thy Days attend, May'st thou ne're Piss, who didst refuse to spend, When all my joys, did on false thee depend. And may Ten thousand abler Pricks agree, To do the wrong'd Corinna, right for thee. A SONG of a young LADY. To her Ancient Lover. 1. Ancient Person, for whom I, All the flattering Youth defy; Long be it e're thou grow Old, Aking, shaking, Crazy Cold. But still continue as thou art, Antient Person of my Heart. 2. On thy withered Lips and dry, Which like barren Furrows lye; Brooding Kisses I will pour, Shall thy youthful Heat restore. Such kind Show'rs in Autumn fall, And a second Spring recall: Nor from thee will ever part, Antient Person of my Heart. 3. Thy Nobler part, which but to name In our Sex wou'd be counted shame, By Ages frozen grasp possest, From his Ice shall be releast: And, sooth'd by my reviving hand, In former Warmth and Vigor stand. All a Lover's wish can reach, For thy Joy my Love shall teach: And for thy Pleasure shall improve, All that Art can add to Love. Yet still I love thee without Art, Antient Person of my Heart. Song [Fair Cloris in a Piggsty lay] Fair Cloris in a Piggsty lay Her tender herd lay by her She slept; in murmring Gruntlings they Complayneing of the scorching Day Her slumbers thus inspire. She dream't while she with carefull pains Her snowy Arms employ'd In Ivory pailes to fill out graines One of her Love Convicted Swaines Thus hasting to her cry'd. Fly Nymph oh! fly e're 'tis too late A Dear lov'd Life to save Rescue your bosom Pigg from fate Who now expires hung in the Gate That leads to Floras Cave. My selfe had try'd to sett him free Rather then brought the newes But I am so abhorr'd by Thee That even thy darlings Life from Mee I know thou wouldst refuse. Struck with the newes as quick she flies As blushes to her face Not the bright Lightning from the Skies Nor Love shott from her brighter eies Move halfe so swift a pace. This Plott it seems the Lustfull Slave Had layd against her Honor Which not one God took care to save For he pursues her to the Cave And throwes him selfe upon her. Now peirced is her virgin Zoan She feels the Foe within it She heares a broken Amorous groan The panting Lovers fainting moan Just in the happy minute. Frighted she wakes and wakeing Friggs Nature thus kindly eas'd In dreams rais'd by her murmring Piggs And her own Thumb between her leggs She's Innocent and pleas'd. SONG [As Chloris full of harmless thought] As Chloris full of harmless thought Beneath the Willows lay, Kind Love a comely Shepherd brought To pass the time away: She blusht to be encounter'd so And chid the amorous Swain; But as she strove to rise and go He pull'd her down again. A sudden passion seiz'd her heart In spight of her disdain, She found a pulse in e'ry part And love in e'ry Vein: Ah Youth quoth she, what charms are these That conquer and surprise; Ah let me! for unless you please I have no power to rise. She faintly spoke and trembling lay For fear he should comply, But Virgins Eyes their hearts betray, And give their Tongues the lie: Thus she who Princes had deny'd With all their pompous Train, Was in the lucky minute try'd And yielded to a Swain. SONG [My dear Mistris has a heart] My dear Mistris has a heart, Soft as those kind looks she gave me, When with Love's resistless Art, And her eyes she did inslave me; But her Constancy's so weak, She's so wild and apt to wander, That my Jealous heart wou'd break, Should we live one day asunder. Melting Joys about her move Killing Pleasures, wounding Blisses, She can dress her Eyes in Love, And her Lips can arm with Kisses; Angels listen when she speaks, She's my delight, all Mankinds wonder; But my Jelous heart would break, Should we live one day asunder. Song. [Phillis, be gentler I advice] Phillis, be gentler I advice, Make up for time mispent, When Beauty, on its Death-Bed lyes, 'Tis high time to repent. Such is the Malice of your Fate, That makes you old so soon, Your pleasure ever comes too late, How early e're begun. Think what a wretched thing is she, Whose Stars, contrive in spight, The Morning of her love shou'd be, Her fading Beauties Night. Then if to make your ruin more, You'll peevishly be coy, Dye with the scandal of a Whore, And never know the joy. Upon his leaving his Mistriss. 'Tis not that I'm weary grown, Of being yours, and yours alone; But with what Face can I incline, To damn you to be only mine? You whom some kinder Pow'r did fashion, By merit, and by inclination, The joy at least of one whole Nation. Let meaner Spirits of your Sex, With humbler aims, their thoughts perplex, And boast, if by their Arts they can, Contrive to make one happy Man; Whilst mov'd by an impartial Sense, Favours like Nature you dispense, With Universal influence. See the kind Seed-receiving Earth, To ev'ry Grain affords a Birth; On her no Show'rs unwelcome fall, Her willing Womb, retains 'em all, And shall my Celia be confin'd? No, live up to thy mighty Mind, And be the Mistriss of Mankind. Upon his Drinking a Bowl. Vulcan contrive me such a Cup, As Nestor us'd of old; Shew all thy skill to trim it up, Damask it round with Gold. Make it so large, that fill'd with Sack, Up to the swelling brim, Vast Toasts, on the delicious Lake, Like Ships at Sea may swim. Engrave no Battail on his Cheek, With War, I've nought to do; I'm none of those that took Mastrich, Nor Yarmouth Leager knew. Let it no name of Planets tell, Fixt Stars, or Constellations; For I am no Sir Sydrophell, Nor none of his Relations. But carve thereon a spreading Vine, Then add Two lovely Boys; Their Limbs in Amorous folds intwine, The Type of future joys. Cupid, and Bacchus, my Saints are, May drink, and Love, still reign, With Wine, I wash away my cares, And then to Cunt again. A SONG. [Absent from thee I languish still] 1 Absent from thee I languish still, Then ask me not, when I return? The straying Fool 'twill plainly kill, To wish all Day, all Night to Mourn. 2 Dear; from thine Arms then let me flie, That my Fantastick mind may prove, The Torments it deserves to try, That tears my fixt Heart from my Love. 3 When wearied with a world of Woe, To thy safe Bosom I retire Where Love and Peace and Truth does flow, May I contented there expire. 4 Lest once more wandring from that Heav'n I fall on some base heart unblest; Faithless to thee, False, unforgiv'n, And lose my Everlasting rest. Song. [How happy Cloris (were they free)] How happy Cloris (were they free) Might our Enjoyments prove, But you with formall Jealousie Are still tormenting Love. Let us (since Witt instructs us how) Raise pleasure to the topp, If Rivall Bottle you'll allow, I'll suffer Rivall Fopp. There's not a briske insipid Sparke, That flutters in the Town, But with your wanton Eyes you marke, The Coxcomb for your owne. You never thinke it worth your care, How empty nor how dull, The heads of your Admirers are, Soe that their Codds be full. All this you freely may confesse, Yet we'll not disagree; For did you love your pleasure lesse, You were not fit for me. While I, my Passion to pursue Am whole Nights takeing in The lusty Juice of Grapes, take you The lusty Juice of Men.

Against Constancy. Tell me no more of constancy, that frivolous pretence, Of cold age, narrow jealousie, disease and want of sence. Let duller fools on whom kind chance some easie heart has thrown, Despairing higher to advance, be kind to one alone. Old men and weak, whose idle flame, their own defects discovers, Since changing can but spread their shame, ought to be constant lovers; But we, whose hearts do justly swell, with no vain-glorious pride, Who know how we in love excell, long to be often try'd. Then bring my Bath, and strew my bed, as each kind night returns, Ile change a Mistress till i'me dead, and fate change me for worms. Song. [While on those lovely looks I gaze] While on those lovely looks I gaze, To see a wretch pursuing, In raptures of a blest amaze His pleasing happy Ruin: 'Tis not for pity that I move, His ffate is too aspiring; Whose heart broke, with a load of Love, Dyes, wishing and admiring. But, if this murder you'd forego, Your Slave from Death removing, Let me your Art of Charming know, Or learn you mine of Loving. But whether Life or Death betide, In Love 'tis equal measure; The Victor lives with empty Pride, The Vanquish'd dyes with Pleasure. Love and Life a Song All my past life is mine noe more The flying Houres are gon Like transitory Dreames giv'n ore Whose Images are kept in Store By Memory alone. What ever is to come is not How can it then be mine, The present Moment's all my Lott And that as fast as it is got Phillis is wholy thine. Then talke not of Inconstancy, False Hearts, and broken Vows, If I, by Miracle can be, This live-long Minute true to thee, Tis all that Heav'n allows. On Mistress Willis Against the Charms our Ballox have How weak all human skill is Since they can make a Man a slave To such a Bitch as Willis. Whom that I may describe throughout Assist me Bawdy Powers I'le write upon a double Clowt And dipp my Pen in Flowers. Her looks demurely Impudent Ungainly Beautifull Her modesty is insolent Her witt both pert and dull. A Prostitute to all the Town And yet with no man Freinds She rails and scolds when she lyes down And Curses when she Spends. Bawdy in thoughts, precise in Words, Ill natur'd though a Whore, Her Belly is a Bagg of Turds, And her Cunt a Common shore. Song. [By all Loves soft, yet mighty Pow'rs] By all Loves soft, yet mighty Pow'rs, It is a thing unfit, That Men shou'd Fuck in time of Flow'rs, Or when the Smock's beshit. Fair nasty Nymph, be clean and kind, And all my joys restore; By using Paper still behind, And Spunges for before. My spotless Flames can ne're decay, If after ev'ry close, My smoaking Prick escape the Fray, Without a Bloody Nose; If thou wou'dst have me true, be wise, And take to cleanly sinning; None but fresh Lovers Pricks can rise, At Phillis in foul linnen.</field>

For Hell, and the foule Fiend that Rules Gods everlasting fiery Jayles (Devis'd by Rogues, dreaded by Fooles) With his grim griezly Dogg, that keepes the Doore, Are senselesse Storyes, idle Tales Dreames, Whimseys, and noe more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUES and EPILOGUES The second Prologue at Court, [to The empress of Morocco] spoken by the Lady ELIZABETH HOWARD. Wit has of late took up a Trick t'appear, Unmannerly, or at the best severe And Poets share the Fate by which we fall, When kindly we attempt to please you all. 'Tis hard, your scorn should against such prevail, Whose ends are to divert you, tho' they fail. You Men would think it an ilnatur'd Jest, Should we laugh at you when you did your best. Then rail not here, though you see reason for't. If Wit can find it self no better sport; Wit is a very foolish thing at Court. Wit's bus'ness is to please, and not to fright, 'Tis no Wit to be always in the right: You'l find it none, who dare be so to night. Few so ill bred will venture to a Play, To spy out Faults in what we Women say. For us no matter what we speak, but how: How kindly can we say—I hate you now. And for the men, if you'l laugh at e'm, do; They mind themselves so much, they'l ne're mind you.— But why do I descend to lose a Prayer On those small Saints in Wit, the God sits there. To you (Great Sir) my Message hither tends, From Youth and Beauty your Allies and Friends. See my Credentials written in my Face, They challenge your Protection in this place: And hither come with such a Force of Charms, As may give check even to your prosp'rous Armes: Millions of Cupids hovering in the Rear, Like Eagles following fatal Troops, appear. All waiting for the slaughter, which draws nigh, Of those bold Gazers, who this Night must dye. Nor can you 'scape our soft Captivitie, From which old Age alone must set you free. Then tremble at the fatal Consequence— Since, 'tis well known for your own part (Great Prince) 'Gainst us you still have made a weak Defence.— Be generous, and wise, and take our part; Remember we have Eyes, and you a Heart. Else you may find, too late, that we are things Born to kil Vassals, and to conquer Kings. But oh! to what vain Conquest I pretend, Whil'st Love is our Commander, and your Friend. Our Victory your Empire more assures, For Love will ever make the Triumph yours. EPILOGUE, [to Love in the dark] As it was spoke by Mr. Haines. As Charms are Nonsence, Nonsence seems a Charm, Which hearers of all Judgment does disarm; For Songs and Scenes, a double Audience bring, And Doggrel takes, which Smiths in Sattin sing. Now to Machines, and a dull Mask you run, We find that Wit's the Monster you would shun, And by my troth 'tis most discreetly done. For since, with Vice and Folly, Wit is fed, Through Mercy 'tis, most of you are not dead. Players turn Puppets now at your desire, In their Mouth's Nonsence, in their Tails a Wire, They fly through Clouds of Clouts, and showers of Fire. A kind of loosing Loadum is their Game, Where the worst Writer has the greatest Fame. To get vile Plays like theirs, shall be our care; But of such awkward Actors we despair. False taught at first— Like Bowls ill byass'd, still the more they run, They're further off; then when they first begun. In Comedy their unweigh'd Action mark, There's one is such a dear familiar spark, He yawns, as if he were but half awake; And fribling for free speaking, does mistake. False accent and neglectful Action too They have both so nigh good, yet neither true, That both together, like an Ape's mock face By near resembling Man, do Man disgrace. Through pac'd ill Actors, may perhaps be cur'd, Half Players like half Wits, can't be endur'd. Yet these are they, who durst expose the Age Of the great Wonder of our English Stage. Whom Nature seem'd to form for your delight, And bid him speak, as she bid Shakespeare write. Those Blades indeed are Cripples in their Art Mimmick his Foot, but not his speaking part. Let them the Traytor or Volpone try, Could they— Rage like Cethegus, or like Cassius die, They ne'er had sent to Paris for such Fancies, As Monster's heads, and Merry Andrew's Dances. Wither'd perhaps, not perish'd we appear, But they were blighted, and ne'er came to bear. Th'old Poets dress'd your Mistress Wit before, These draw you on with an old Painted Whore, And sell like Bawds, patch'd Plays for Maids twice o'er. Yet they may scorn our House and Actors too, Since they have swell'd so high to hector you. They cry, Pox o' these Covent Garden Men, Dam 'em, not one of them, but keeps out Ten. Were they once gone, we for those thundering Blades, Should have an Audience of substantial Trades, Who love our muzzled Boys, and tearing Fellows, My Lord great Neptune, and great Nephew Eolus. Oh how the merry Citizen's in love With— Psyche, the Goddess of each Field and Grove. He cryes i'faith, methinks 'tis well enough, But you roar out and cry, 'Tis all damn'd stuff. So to their House the graver Fops repair, While Men of Wit, find one another here. THE EPILOGUE [to Circe] Some few from Wit have this true Maxime got, That 'tis still better to be pleas'd then not, And therefore never their own Torment plot. While the Malitious Criticks still agree To loath each Play they come and pay to see; The first know 'tis a Meaner part of sence To finde a fault, then taste an Excellence; Therefore they praise and strive to like, while these Are dully vain of being hard to please. Poets and Women have an Equal Right To hate the Dull, who Dead to all Delight Feel pain alone, and have no Joy but spite. 'Twas Impotence did first this Vice begin, Fooles censure Wit, as Old men raile of Sin, Who Envy Pleasure, which they cannot tast, And good for nothing, wou'd be wise at last. Since therefore to the Women it appears, That all these Enemies of Wit are theirs, Our Poet the Dull herd no longer fears. What e're his fate may prove, 'twill be his pride To stand or fall, with Beauty on his side.</field>

[[Letter from Mistress Price to Lord Chesterfield]] My Lord These are the Gloves that I did mention Last night, and t'was with the intention That you should give mee thankes and wear them For I most willingly can spare them. When you this Packet first doe see Dam mee, crie you shee has writ to mee I had better be at Bretby still Than troubled with love against my will Besides this is not all my sorrow Shee writ to day, shee'l come to morrow, Then you consider the adventure And think you never shall content her But when you doe the inside see You'l find things are but as they should be And that tis neither love nor passion But only for your recreation. Upon Nothing Nothing thou Elder Brother even to Shade Thou hadst a being ere the world was made And (well fixt) art alone of ending not afraid. Ere Time and Place were, Time and Place were not When Primitive Nothing, somthing straight begott Then all proceeded from the great united what— Somthing, the Generall Attribute of all Severed from thee its sole Originall Into thy boundless selfe must undistinguisht fall. Yet Somthing did thy mighty power command And from thy fruitfull Emptinesses hand Snatcht, Men, Beasts, birds, fire, water, Ayre, and land. Matter, the Wickedst offspring of thy Race By forme assisted flew from thy Embrace And Rebell-Light obscured thy Reverend dusky face. With forme and Matter, Time and Place did joyne Body thy foe with these did Leagues combine To spoyle thy Peaceful Realme and Ruine all thy Line. But Turncote-time assists the foe in vayne And brib'd by thee destroyes their short liv'd Reign And to thy hungry wombe drives back thy slaves again. Though Misteries are barr'd from Laick Eyes And the Divine alone with warrant pries Into thy Bosome, where thy truth in private lyes Yet this of thee the wise may truly say Thou from the virtuous Nothing doest delay And to be part of thee the wicked wisely pray. Great Negative how vainly would the wise Enquire, define, distinguish, teach, devise, Didst Thou not stand to poynt their blind Phylosophies. Is or is not, the two great Ends of ffate And true or false the Subject of debate That perfect or destroy the vast designes of State— When they have wrackt the Politicians Brest Within thy Bosome most Securely rest And when reduc't to thee are least unsafe and best. But (Nothing) why does Somthing still permitt That Sacred Monarchs should at Councell sitt With persons highly thought, at best for nothing fitt, Whilst weighty Somthing modestly abstaynes ffrom Princes Coffers and from Statesmens braines And nothing there like Stately nothing reignes? Nothing who dwell'st with fooles in grave disguise ffor whom they Reverend Shapes and formes devise Lawn-sleeves and ffurrs and Gowns, when they like thee looke wise: ffrench Truth, Dutch Prowess, Brittish policy Hibernian Learning, Scotch Civility Spaniards Dispatch, Danes witt, are Mainly seen in thee; The Great mans Gratitude to his best freind Kings promises, Whors vowes towards thee they bend fflow Swiftly into thee, and in thee ever end. A Ramble in Saint James's Parke Much wine had past with grave discourse Of who Fucks who and who does worse Such as you usually doe hear From those that diet at the Beare When I who still take care to see Drunkenness Reliev'd by Leachery Went out into Saint James's Park To coole my head and fire my heart. But tho' Saint James has the Honor on't 'Tis Consecrate to Prick and Cunt. There by a most incestuous Birth Strange woods spring from the Teeming Earth For they Relate how heretofore When auncient Pict began to whore Deluded of his Assignation (Jylting it seems was then in fashion) Poor pensive Lover in this place Wou'd frigg upon his Mothers face Whence Rowes of Mandrakes tall did rise Whose lewd Topps Fuckt the very Skies Each imitative branch does twine In some lov'd fold of Aretine And nightly now beneath their shade Are Buggeries, Rapes, and Incests made: Unto this all-sin-sheltring Grove Whores of the Bulk, and the Alcove, Great Ladies, Chamber Mayds, and Drudges, The Ragg picker, and Heiress Trudges; Carrmen, Divines, Great Lords, and Taylors, Prentices, Poets, Pimps, and Gaolers, Footmen, Fine Fopps, doe here arrive, And here promiscuously they swive. Along these hallow'd walkes it was That I beheld Corinna pass. Who ever had bin by to see The prowd disdain she cast on Mee Through charming eies he would have swore She dropt from Heaven that very Hour Forsakeing the Divine abode In scorn of some dispaireing God. But mark what Creatures women are How infinitly vile when fair: Three Knights of the Elboe and the Slurr With wriggling tailes made up to her. The first was of your Whitehall Blades Nere kin to the Mother of the Mayds Grac'd by whose favor he was able To bring a Freind to the waiters Table Where he had heard Sir Edward Sutton Say how the King lov'd Banstead Mutton; Since when hee'd nere be brought to eat By's good will any other meat. In this as well as all the rest He ventures to doe like the best But wanting Common Sence, th'ingredient In chooseing well not least expedient Converts abortive Imitation To universall Affectation. Thus he not only eats and Talks But feels and smells sitts down and walks Nay looks, and lives, and loves by Rote In an old Tawdry Birthday Coat. The second was a Grays Inn witt A great Inhabiter of the Pitt Where Crittick-like he sitts and squints Steales Pockett Handkerchers and hints From's Neighbour and the Comedy To Court and pay his Landlady. The third a Ladyes Eldest Son Within few yeares of Twenty one Who hopes from his propitious Fate Against he comes to his Estate By these Two Worthies to be made A most accomplish'd tearing blade. One in a strain 'twixt Tune and Nonsence Cries Madam I have lov'd you long since Permitt me your fair hand to kiss; When at her Mouth her Cunt cries yes. In short without much more adoe Joyfull and pleas'd away she flew And with these Three Confounded Asses From Park to Hackney Coach she passes. So a prowd Bitch does lead about Of humble Currs the Amorous Rout Who most obsequiously doe hunt The savory scent of salt swoln Cunt. Some power more patient now Relate The sence of this surpriseing Fate. Gods! that a thing admir'd by mee Shou'd fall to so much Infamy. Had she pickt out to rub her Arse on Some stiff prickt Clown or well hung Parson Each jobb of whose spermatique sluce Had fill'd her Cunt with wholesome Juice I the proceeding should have praisd In hope she had quench'd a fire I rais'd. Such naturall freedomes are but Just There's something Genrous in meer lust. But to turn damn'd abandon'd Jade When neither Head nor Taile perswade To be a Whore in understanding A passive pott for Fools to spend in. The Devill play'd booty sure with Thee To bring a blott on Infamy. But why am I of all Mankind To so severe a Fate design'd Ungratefull! Why this Treachery To humble fond beleiveing mee Who gave you Priviledge above The nice allowances of Love? Did ever I refuse to bear The meanest part your Lust could spare When your lewd Cunt came spewing home Drench't with the seed of halfe the Town My dram of sperm was sup't up after For the digestive surfeit water. Full gorged at another time With a vast meal of nasty slime Which your devouring Cunt had drawn From Porters Backs and Footmens brawn I was content to serve you up My Ballock full for your Grace cupp Nor ever thought it an abuse While you had pleasure for excuse You that cou'd make my heart away For noise and Colour and betray The secretts of my tender houres To such knight errant Paramours When leaneing on your faithless breast Wrapt in security and rest Soft kindness all my powers did move And Reason lay dissolv'd in Love. May stinking vapours Choak your womb Such as the Men you doat upon May your depraved Appetite That cou'd in whiffling Fools delight Begett such Frenzies in your Mind You may goe madd for the North wind And fixing all your hopes upont To have him bluster in your Cunt Turn up your longing Arse to the Air And perrish in a wild dispair. But Cowards shall forgett to rant, School-Boyes to Frigg, old whores to paint; The Jesuits Fraternity Shall leave the use of Buggery; Crab-louse inspir'd with Grace divine From Earthly Codd to Heaven shall climb; Phisitions shall believe in Jesus And Dissobedience ceace to please us E're I desist with all my Power To plague this woman and undoe her. But my Revenge will best be tim'd When she is Married, that is lym'd. In that most lamentable state I'le make her feel my scorn and hate Pelt her with scandalls, Truth or lies And her poor Curr with Jealousies Till I have torn him from her Breech While she whines like a Dogg-drawn Bitch Loath'd, and despis'd, Kick't out of Town Into some dirty Hole alone To chew the Cudd of Misery And know she owes it all to Mee. And may no Woman better thrive That dares prophane the Cunt I swive. Lampoone To longe the Wise Commons have been in debate About Money, and Conscience (those Trifles of State) Whilst dangerous Greyvances daily increase, And the Subject can't riott in Safety, and peace. Unlesse (as agaynst Irish Cattle before) You now make an Act, to forbid Irish whore. The Cootes (blacke, and white) Clenbrazell, and Fox Invade us with Impudence, beauty, and pox. They carry a Fate, which noe man can oppose; The losse of his heart, and the fall of his Nose. Should he dully resist, yet wou'd each take upon her, To beseech him to doe it, and engage him in honour. O! Yee mercifull powers, who of Mortalls take Care, Make the Woman more modest, more sound, or lesse fayre. Is it just, that with death cruell Love should conspire, And our Tarses be burnt by our hearts taking fire? There's an end of Communion, if humble Beleavers Must bee damn'd in the Cup, like unworthy Receavers. Tunbridge Wells A Satyr. At Five this Morne, when Phœbus raisd his head, From Thetis Lapp, I rais'd my self from Bed; And mounting Steed, I trotted to the Waters, The Rendevouz of Fooles, Buffoones, and Praters, Cuckolds, Whores, Cittizens, their Wives and Daughters. My Squeamish Stomach, I with Wine had brib'd, To undertake the Dose, it was prescrib'd. But turning head, a sudden cursed view, That innocent provision overthrew, And without drinking made me Purge, and Spew. From Coach, and Six, a thing unweildy Roll'd, Whose Lumber, Cart, more decently wou'd hold; As wise as Calf it look'd, as bigg as Bully, But handl'd proves a meere Sir Nich'las Cully: A Bawling Fopp, a Nat'rall Nokes, and yet He dares to censure, as if he had Witt: To make him more rediculous in spight, Nature, contriv'd the Fool shou'd be a Knight. Grant yee unlucky Starrs, this ore'growne Boy, To purchase some inspireing pretty Toy, That may his want of Sense, and Witt supply, As Buxome Crabb-fish, do his Lechery: Tho' he alone, were dismall sight enough, His Traine contributed to set him off, All of his Shape, all of the self same stuffe: Noe Spleene, or Malice, need on them be throwne, Nature, has done the Bus'nesse of Lampoone, And in their lookes, their Characters has showne. [Thrice blest be he, who Dildoe did invent! To ramm the Neigb'ring hole to Fundament; Which may be lengthen'd, thicken'd, in its measure, And us'd at Lech'rous ugly Trullas pleasure: For ne're was Bulke, or Stomach giv'n to Tarses, Either to fill, or swell, such Foggy Arses.] Endeavouring this irksome sight to Balke, And a more irksome noyse, their silly talke, I silently slunke downe, to th'lower Walke: But often, when one wou'd Caribdis shun, Downe upon Scilla, 'tis ones Fate to run: For here, it was my cursed luck to find, As greate a Fopp, tho' of another kind. A Tall, stiffe Foole, that walkt in Spanish guise, The Buckram Puppet, never stirr'd its Eyes; But grave as Owle it look'd, as Wood-Cock wise. He scornes the empty talking of this Mad-Age, And speakes all Proverbs, Sentences, and Adage; Can with as much solemnity, buy Eggs, As a Caball, can talke of their Intrigues. Master of Ceremony; yet can dispence, With the formality of talking Sence. From hence, unto the upper end I ran, Where a new Scene of Foppery began. A Tribe of Curates, Priests, Canonicall Elves, (Fit Company for none besides themselves) Were got together; each his distemper told, Scurvy, Stone, Strangury: some were soe bold, To charge the Spleene to be their misery, And on that wise Disease, brought Infamy. But none had Modesty enough to 'plaine, Their want of Learning, Honesty, and Braine, The generall Diseases of that Traine: These call themselves Ambassadors of Heav'n, And sawcily pretend Commissions giv'n; But shou'd an Indian King, whose small Command Seldome extends beyond Ten Miles of Land; Send forth such wretched Tooles in an Ambassage He'd find but small Effects of such a Message. Listning I found the Cobb of all this Rabble Pert Bayes, with his Importance Comfortable: He being rais'd to an Arch-Deaconry, By trampling on Religion, Liberty; Was growne too great, and look'd too fat and Jolly, To be disturb'd with care, and Melancholly, Tho' Marvell has enough, expos'd his Folly. He dranke to carry off some old remaines, His Lazy dull distemper, left in's Veines: Let him drinke on, but 'tis not a whole Flood, Can give sufficient sweetnesse to his blood, To make his Nature, or his Manners good. Importance dranke too, tho' she'd beene noe Sinner To wash away some Dreggs, he had spewd in her. Next after these, a fulsome Irish Crew, Of silly Macs were offer'd to my view; The things did talke, but th'hearing what they said, I did my self the kindnesse to evade: Nature, hath plac'd these Wretches beneath Scorne, They can't be call'd soe vile, as they are borne. Amidst the Croud, next I my self convey'd, For now were come (White-wash, and Paint being laid) Mother, and Daughter, Mistresse and the Maid; And Squire with Wigg, and Pantaloone, display'd. But ne're cou'd Conventickle, Play, or Fair, For a true Medley, with this Herd compare. Here Lords, Knights, Squires, Ladys, and Countesses, Chandlers, Mum-Bacon-Women, Sempstresses, Were mixt together; nor did they agree, More in their Humours, than their Quality. Here waiting for Gallant, young Damsell stood, Leaning on Cane, and muffled up in Hood: The Woud-be-Witt, whose bus'nesse was to Wooe, With Hatt, remov'd, and Solemn Scrape of Shooe, Advanceth bowing, then gentiley shruggs, And ruffled Foretop, into Order tuggs. And thus Accosts her:—Madam methinkes the Weather Is growne much more Serene, since you came hither: You Influence the Heav'ns—but shou'd the Sun, Withdraw himself to see his Rayes outdone By your bright Eyes; they wou'd supply the Morne And make a Day, before the Day be borne. With Mouth screwd up, conceited winking Eyes, And Breasts thrust forward—Lord Sir (she replyes) It is your goodnesse, and not my Deserts Which makes you Shew, this Learning, Witt, and Parts. He puzled, bites his Naile, both to display, The sparkling Ring, and thinke what next to say. And thus breakes forth a fresh: Madam, Egad Your luck at Cards last Night, was very bad; At Cribbidge, Fifty Nyne, and the next show To make the Game; and yet to want those Two. Gad-Damme Madam, I'm the Son of a Whore If in my life, I saw the like before. To Pedlars Stall he draggs her, and her Breast With Hearts, and such like foolish toyes he drest; And then more smartly to expound the Riddle Of all his prattle, gives her a Scotch Fiddle. Tir'd with this dismall Stuffe, away I ran, Where were Two Wives, with Girle just fit for Man; Short-breath'd, with pallid Lipps, and Vissage wan. Some Curt'sies past, and the Old Complement Of being glad to see each other spent; With hand, in hand, they loveingly did walke And one began thus to renew the talke. I pray, good Madam, if it may be thought, Noe rudenesse, what cause was it hither brought Your Ladyshipp? She soone replying, smild, Wee have a good Estate, but have noe Child; And I'm inform'd these Wells, will make a Barren Woman, as fruitfull as a Coney-Warren. The first return'd—For this cause I am come For I can have, noe quietnesse at home, My Husband grumbles tho' wee have got one, This poor young Girle, and mutters for a Son; And this griev'd with Head-Ach pangs, and Throwes, Is full Sixteene, and never yet had those. She soone reply'd.—Get her a Husband Madam, I Marry'd at that Age, and ne're had had 'em: Was just like her; Steele-Waters, let alone, A Back of Steele, will bring 'em better downe. And Tenn to one but they themselves will try The same meanes, to encrease their Family. Poor foolish Fribble,—who by Subtlety Of Mid-Wife, truest Friend to Letchery, Perswaded Art, to be at paines, and charge, To give thy Wife occasion to enlarge Thy silly head! For here walke Cuffe, and Kick, With Brawney Back, and Leggs, and potent Prick. Who more substantially will cure thy Wife, And on her half-dead Womb, bestowe new life. From these, the Waters got the Reputation, Of good Assistants unto Generation. Some Warr-like Men were now got into th'throng With Hair ty'd back, singing a Bawdy-Song. Not much afraid, I got a nearer view, And 'twas my chance to know the dreadfull Crew. They were Cadets, that seldome can appeare Damn'd to the Stint of Thirty Pounds a yeare; With Hawke on Fist, or Grey-Hound led in hand, The Doggs, and Foot-Boys, sometimes they Command; But now haveing trimmd a Cast of Spavin'd Horse, With Three hard-pincht-for-Guineys in the Purse, Two Rusty Pistolls, Scarfe about the Arse Coat, lin'd with Red, they here presume to swell This goes for Captaine, that for Collonell; Soe the Beare-Garden Ape on his Steed mounted, Noe longer is a Jackanapes accounted; But is by virtue of his Trump'rie then Call'd by the Name of the Young Gentleman. Blesse me thought I, what thing is Man that thus In all his shapes, he is rediculous? Our selves, with noyse of Reason wee doe please In vaine: Humanity is our worst Disease. Thrice happy Beasts are, who because they be Of Reason voyd are soe of Foppery; Faith I was soe asham'd that with remorse, I us'd the Insolence to mount my Horse; For he doeing only things fit for his Nature, Did seeme to me by much the wiser Creature. [[A Satire on Charles II]] I'th' Isle of Britaine long since famous growne For breeding the best cunts in Christendome, There reigns and oh long may hee reigne and thrive The easiest King and best bred man alive. Him no Ambition mooves, to gett Renowne Like the french Foole who wanders up and downe Starving his People, hazarding his Crowne. Peace is his Aime, his Gentlenesse is such And Love, he loves, for he loves fucking much. Nor are his high Desires above his Strength, His Sceptter and his Prick are of a Length, And she may sway the one, who plays with th'other And make him little wiser than his Brother. Restlesse he roalles about from Whore to Whore A merry Monarch, scandalous and poor. Poor Prince thy Prick like thy Buffoons at Court Will governe thee because it makes thee sportt. 'Tis sure the swaucyest that e're did swive The proudest peremtoriest Prick alive. Though Safety, Law, Religion, Life lay on't, 'Twould breake through all to make its way to Cunt. To Carwell the most Deare of all his deares The best Reliefe of his declining yeares Offt hee bewayles his fortunes and her fate To love so well and be belov'd so late. For though in her he setles well his Tarse Yett his dull graceless Ballocks hang an arse. This you'd beleive had I butt Tyme to tell you The Paynes itt Cost the poor laborious Nelly Whilst shee imployes, hands, fingers, mouth, and thighs E're shee can raise the Member she enjoys— I hate all Monarchs, and the Thrones they sit on From the Hector of France to the Culley of Britaine. Signior Dildo. You Ladyes all of Merry England Who have been to kisse the Dutchesse's hand, Pray did you lately observe in the Show A Noble Italian call'd Signior Dildo? The Signior was one of her Highness's Train And helpt to Conduct her over the Main, But now she Crys out to the Duke I will go, I have no more need for Seignior Dildo. At the Signe of the Crosse in Saint James's Street, When next you go thither to make your Selfes Sweet, By Buying of Powder, Gloves, Essence, or Soe You may Chance get a Sight of Signior Dildo. You'l take him at first for no Person of Note Because he appears in a plain Leather Coat: But when you his virtuous Abilities know You'll fall down and Worship Signior Dildo. My Lady Southesk, Heav'ns prosper her for't, First Cloath'd him in Satten, then brought him to Court; But his Head in the Circle, he Scarcely durst Show, So modest a Youth was Signior Dildo. The good Lady Suffolk thinking no harm, Had got this poor Stranger hid under her Arm: Lady Betty by Chance came the Secret to know, And from her own Mother, Stole Signior Dildo: The Countesse of Falmouth, of whom People tell Her Footmen wear Shirts of a Guinea an Ell: Might Save the Expence, if she did but know How Lusty a Swinger is Signior Dildo. By the Help of this Gallant the Countesse of Rafe Against the feirce Harris preserv'd her Self Safe: She Stifl'd him almost beneath her Pillow, So Closely she imbrac'd Signior Dildo. Our dainty fine Dutchesse's have got a Trick To Doat on a Fool, for the Sake of his Prick, The Fopps were undone, did their Graces but know The Discretion and vigor of Signior Dildo. That Pattern of Virtue, her Grace of Cleaveland, Has Swallow'd more Pricks, then the Ocean has Sand, But by Rubbing and Scrubbing, so large it do's grow, It is fit for just nothing but Signior Dildo. The Dutchesse of Modena, tho' she looks high, With such a Gallant is contented to Lye: And for fear the English her Secrets shou'd know, For a Gentleman Usher took Signior Dildo. The countess of the Cockpit (who knows not her Name) She's famous in Story, for a Killing Dame: When all her old Lovers forsake her I Trow She'l then be contented with Signior Dildo. Red Howard, Red Sheldon, and Temple so tall Complain of his absence so long from Whitehall: Signior Barnard has promis'd a Journy to goe, And bring back his Countryman Signior Dildo. Doll Howard no longer with his Highness must Range, And therefore is profer'd this Civill Exchange: Her Teeth being rotten, she Smells best below, And needs must be fitted for Signior Dildo. St Albans with Wrinkles and Smiles in his Face Whose kindnesse to Strangers, becomes his high Place, In his Coach and Six Horses is gone to Pergo, To take the fresh Air with Signior Dildo. Were this Signior but known to the Citizen Fopps He'd keep their fine Wives from the Foremen of Shops, But the Rascalls deserve their Horns shou'd Still grow, For Burning the Pope, and his Nephew Dildo. Tom Killigrews wife, North Hollands fine Flower, At the Sight of this Signior, did fart, and Belch Sow'r, And her Dutch Breeding farther to Show, Says welcome to England, myn Heer Van Dildo. He civilly came to the Cockpitt one night, And profer'd his Service to fair Madam Knight, Quoth she, I intrigue with Captain Cazzo Your Nose in myne Arse good Seignior Dildo. This Signior is sound, safe, ready, and Dumb, As ever was Candle, Carret, or Thumb: Then away with these nasty devices, and Show How you rate the just merits of Signior Dildo. Count Cazzo who carryes his Nose very high, In Passion he Swore, his Rivall shou'd Dye, Then Shutt up himself, to let the world know, Flesh and Blood cou'd not bear it from Signior Dildo. A Rabble of Pricks, who were welcome before, Now finding the Porter deny'd 'em the Door, Maliciously waited his coming below, And inhumanely fell on Signior Dildo. Nigh weary'd out, the poor Stranger did fly And along the Pallmall, they follow'd full Cry, The Women concern'd from every Window, Cry'd, Oh! for Heavn's sake save Signior Dildo. The good Lady Sandys, burst into a Laughter To see how the Ballocks came wobbling after, And had not their weight retarded the Fo Indeed 't had gone hard with Signior Dildo. Satyr. [Timon] A. What Timon does old Age begin t'approach That thus thou droop'st under a Nights debauch? Hast thou lost deep to needy Rogues on Tick Who ne're cou'd pay, and must be paid next Week. Tim. Neither alas, but a dull dining Sot, Seiz'd me ith' Mall, who just my name had got; He runs upon me, cries dear Rogue I'm thine, With me some Wits, of thy acquaintance dine. I tell him I'm engag'd, but as a Whore, With modesty enslaves her Spark, the more, The longer I deny'd, the more he prest, At last I e'ne consent to be his Guest. He takes me in his Coach, and as we go, Pulls out a Libel, of a Sheet, or two; Insipid, as, the praise of pious Queens, Or Shadwells, unassisted former Scenes; Which he admir'd, and prais'd at ev'ry Line, At last it was so sharp, it must be mine. I vow'd I was no more a Wit, than he, Unpractic'd, and unblest in Poetry: A Song to Phillis, I perhaps might make, But never Rhym'd, but for my Pintles sake: I envy'd no Mans fortune, nor his fame, Nor ever thought of a revenge so tame. He knew my Stile, he sword, and 'twas in vain, Thus to deny the Issue of my Brain. Choak'd with his flatt'ry, I no answer make, But silent leave him to his dear mistake Which he, by this, has spread o're the whole Town, And me, with an officious Lye, undone. Of a well meaning Fool, I'm most afraid, Who sillily repeats, what was well said. But this was not the worst, when he came home, He askt are Sidley, Buchurst, Savill, come? No, but there were above Halfwit and Huffe Kickum, and Dingboy. Oh 'tis well enough. They're all brave Fellows cryes mine Host, let's Dine, I long to have my Belly full of Wine, They'll write, and fight I dare assure you, They're Men, Tam Marte quam Mercurio. I saw my error, but 'twas now too late, No means, nor hopes, appear of a retreat. Well we salute, and each Man takes his Seat. Boy (says my Sot) is my Wife ready yet? A Wife good Gods! a Fop and Bullys too! For one poor Meale, what must I undergo? In comes my Lady strait, she had been Fair, Fit to give love, and to prevent despair. But Age, Beauties incurable Disease, Had left her more desire, than pow'r to please. As Cocks, will strike, although their Spurrs be gone, She with her old bleer Eyes to smite begun: Though nothing else, she (in despight of time) Preserv'd the affectation of her prime; How ever you begun, she brought in love, And hardly from that Subject wou'd remove. We chancd to speak of the French Kings success; My Lady wonder'd much how Heav'n cou'd bless, A Man, that lov'd Two Women at one time; But more how he to them excus'd his Crime. She askt Huffe, if Loves flame he never felt? He answer'd bluntly—do you think I'm gelt? She at his plainness smil'd, then turn'd to me, Love in young Minds, preceeds ev'n Poetry. You to that passion can no Stranger be, But Wits, are giv'n to inconstancy. She had run on I think till now, but Meat Came up, and suddenly she took her seat. I thought the Dinner wou'd make some amends, When my good Host cryes out-y'are all my Friends, Our own plain Fare, and the best Terse the Bull Affords, I'll give you and your Bellies full: As for French Kickshaws, Cellery, and Champoon, Ragous and Fricasses, introth we'ave none. Here's a good Dinner towards thought I, when strait Up comes a piece of Beef, full Horsmans weight; Hard as the Arse of Mosely, under which, The Coachman sweats, as ridden by a Witch. A Dish of Carrets, each of 'em as long, As Tool, that to fair Countess, did belong; Which her small Pillow, cou'd not so well hide, But Visiters, his flaming Head espy'd. Pig, Goose, and Capon, follow'd in the Rear, With all that Country Bumpkins, call good Cheer: Serv'd up with Sauces all of Eighty Eight, When our tough Youth, wrestled, and threw the Weight. And now the Bottle, briskly flies about, Instead of Ice, wrapt up in a wet Clowt. A Brimmer follows the Third bit we eat, Small Bear, becomes our drink, and Wine, our Meat. The Table was so large, that in less space, A Man might safe, Six old Italians place: Each Man had as much room, as Porter, Blunt, Or Harris, had, in Cullens, Bushel Cunt. And now the Wine began to work, mine Host Had been a Collonel we must hear him boast Not of Towns won, but an Estate he lost For the Kings Service, which indeed he spent Whoring, and Drinking, but with good intent. He talkt much of a Plot, and Money lent In Cromwells time. My Lady she Complain'd our love was course, our Poetry, Unfit for modest Eares: small Whores, and Play'rs Were of our Hair-brain'd Youth, the only cares; Who were too wild for any virtuous League, Too rotten to consummate the Intrigue. Falkland, she prais'd, and Sucklings, easie Pen, And seem'd to taste their former parts again. Mine Host, drinks to the best in Christendome, And decently my Lady, quits the Room. Left to our selves, of several things we prate, Some regulate the Stage, and some the State. Halfwit, cries up my Lord of Orrery, Ah how well Mustapha, and Zanger dye! His sense so little forc'd, that by one Line, You may the other easily divine. And which is worse, if any worse can be, He never said one word of it to me. There's fine Poetry! you'd swear 'twere Prose, So little on the Sense, the Rhymes impose. Damn me (says Dingboy) in my mind Gods-swounds Etheridge, writes Airy Songs, and soft Lampoons, The best of any Man; as for your Nowns, Grammar, and Rules of Art, he knows 'em not, Yet writ Two talking Plays, without one Plot. Huffe, was for Settle, and Morocco, prais'd, Said rumbling words, like Drums, his courage rais'd. Whose broad-built-bulks, the boyst'rous Billows, bear, Zaphee and Sally, Mugadore, Oran, The fam'd Arzile, Alcazer, Tituan. Was ever braver Language writ by Man? Kickum for Crown declar'd, said in Romance, He had out done the very Wits, of France. Witness Pandion, and his Charles the Eight; Where a young Monarch, careless of his Fate, Though Forreign Troops, and Rebels, shock his State, Complains another sight afflicts him more. (Videl.) The Queens Galleys rowing from the Shore, Fitting their Oars and Tackling to be gon Whilst sporting Waves smil'd on the rising Sun. Waves smiling on the Sun! I'm sure that's new, And 'twas well thought on, give the Devil his due. Mine Host, who had said nothing in an hour, Rose up, and prais'd the Indian Emperor. As if our Old World, modestly withdrew, And here in private had brought forth a New. There are Two Lines! who but he durst presume To make the old World, a new withdrawing Room, Whereof another World she's brought to Bed! What a brave Midwife is a Laureats head! But pox of all these Scriblers, what do'e think. Will Souches this year any Champoone drink? Will Turene fight him? without doubt says Huffe, When they Two meet, their meeting will be rough. Damn me (says Dingboy) the French, Cowards are, They pay, but the English, Scots, and Swiss make War. In gawdy Troops, at a review they shine, But dare not with the Germans, Battel joyn; What now appears like courage, is not so, 'Tis a short pride, which from success does grow; On their first blow, they'll shrink into those fears, They shew'd at Cressy, Agincourt, Poytiers; Their loss was infamous, Honor so stain'd, Is by a Nation not to be regain'd. What they were then I know not, now th'are brave, He that denies it—lyes and is a Slave (Says Huffe and frown'd) says Dingboy, that do I, And at that word, at t'others Head let fly A greasie Plate, when suddenly they all, Together by the Eares in Parties fall. Halfwit, with Dingboy joynes, Kickum with Huffe Their Swords were safe, and so we let 'em cuff Till they mine Host, and I, had all enough. Their rage once over, they begin to treat, And Six fresh Bottles, must the peace compleat. I ran down Stairs, with a Vow never more To drink Bear Glass, and hear the Hectors roar. A Letter from Artemiza in the Towne to Chloe in the Countrey. Chloe, in Verse by your commande I write; Shortly you'l bid mee ride astride, and fight. These Talents better with our sexe agree, Then lofty flights of dang'rous poetry. Amongst the Men (I meane) the Men of Witt (At least they passt for such, before they writt) How many bold Advent'rers for the Bayes, (Proudly designing large returnes of prayse) Who durst that stormy pathlesse World explore, Were soone dash't backe, and wreck't on the dull shore, Broke of that little stocke, they had before? How would a Womans tott'ring Barke be tost, Where stoutest Ships (the Men of Witt) are lost? When I reflect on this, I straight grow wise, And my owne selfe thus gravely I advise. Deare Artemiza, poetry's a snare: Bedlam has many Mansions: have a Care. Your Muse diverts you, makes the Reader sad; You Fancy, you'r inspir'd, he thinkes, you mad. Consider too, 'twill be discreetly done, To make your Selfe the Fiddle of the Towne, To fynd th'ill-humour'd pleasure att their need, Curst, if you fayle, and scorn'd, though you succeede. Thus, like an Arrant Woman, as I am, Noe sooner well convinc'd, writing's a shame, That Whore is scarce a more reproachfull name, Then Poetesse: Like Men, that marry, or like Maydes, that woe, 'Cause 'tis the very worst thing they can doe, Pleas'd with the Contradiction, and the Sin, Mee-thinkes, I stand on Thornes, till I begin. Y'expect att least, to heare, what Loves have past In this Lewd Towne, synce you, and I mett last. What change has happen'd of Intrigues, and whether The Old ones last, and who, and who's togeather. But how, my dearest Chloe, shall I sett My pen to write, what I would faine forgett, Or name that lost thing (Love) without a teare Synce soe debauch'd by ill-bred Customes here? Love, the most gen'rous passion of the mynde, The softest refuge Innocence can fynde, The safe directour of unguided youth, Fraught with kind wishes, and secur'd by Trueth, That Cordiall dropp Heav'n in our Cup has throwne, To make the nauseous draught of life goe downe, On which one onely blessing God might rayse In lands of Atheists Subsidyes of prayse (For none did e're soe dull, and stupid prove, But felt a God, and blest his pow'r in Love) This onely Joy, for which poore Wee were made, Is growne like play, to be an Arrant Trade; The Rookes creepe in, and it has gott of late As many little Cheates, and Trickes, as that. But what yet more a Womans heart would vexe, 'Tis cheifely carry'd on by our owne Sexe, Our silly Sexe, who borne, like Monarchs, free, Turne Gipsyes for a meaner Liberty, And hate restraint, though but from Infamy. They call whatever is not Common, nice, And deafe to Natures rule, or Loves advice, Forsake the pleasure, to pursue the Vice. To an exact perfection they have wrought The Action Love, the Passion is forgott. 'Tis below witt, they tell you, to admire, And e'ne without approving they desire. Their private wish obeys the publicke Voyce, 'Twixt good, and bad Whimsey decides, not Choyce. Fashions grow up for tast, att Formes they strike: They know, what they would have, not what they like. Bovey's a beauty, if some few agree, To call him soe, the rest to that degree Affected are, that with their Eares they see. Where I was visiting the other night, Comes a fine Lady with her humble Knight, Who had prevayl'd on her, through her owne skill, At his request, though much against his will, To come to London. As the Coach stop't, wee heard her Voyce more loud, Then a great belly'd Womans in a Crowd, Telling the Knight, that her affayres require, Hee for some houres obsequiously retire. I thinke, shee was asham'd, to have him seene (Hard fate of Husbands) the Gallant had beene, Though a diseas'd ill-favour'd Foole, brought in. Dispatch, sayes shee, that bus'nesse you pretend, Your beastly visitt to your drunken freind; A Bottle ever makes you looke soe fine! Mee-thinkes I long, to smell you stinke of Wine. Your Countrey-drinking-breath's enough, to kill Sowre Ale corrected with a Lemmon pill. Prithy farewell-wee'le meete againe anon; The necessary thing bows, and is gone. She flyes up stayres, and all the hast does show, That fifty Antique postures will allow, And then bursts out—Deare Madam, am not I The alter'dst Creature breathing? Let me dye, I fynde my selfe ridiculously growne Embarassé with being out of Towne, Rude, and untaught, like any Indian Queene; My Countrey nakednesse is strangely seene. How is Love govern'd? Love, that rules the State, And, pray, who are the Men most worne of late? When I was marry'd, Fooles were a la mode, The Men of Witt were then held incommode, Slow of beleife, and fickle in desire, Who e're they'l be persuaded, must inquire, As if they came to spye, not to admire. With searching Wisedome fatall to their ease They still fynde out, why, what may, should not please; Nay take themselves for injur'd, when Wee dare, Make 'em thinke better of us, then Wee are: And if Wee hide our frailtyes from their sights, Call Us deceitefull Gilts, and Hypocrites. They little guesse, who att Our Arts are greiv'd, The perfect Joy of being well deceaved. Inquisitive, as jealous Cuckolds, grow, Rather, then not bee knowing, they will know, What being knowne creates their certaine woe. Women should these of all Mankind avoyd; For Wonder by cleare knowledge is destroy'd. Woman, who is an Arrant Bird of night, Bold in the Duske, before a Fooles dull sight, Should flye, when Reason brings the glaring light: But the kinde easy Foole apt, to admire Himselfe, trusts us, his Follyes all conspire, To flatter his, and favour Our desire. Vaine of his proper Meritt he with ease Beleaves, wee love him best, who best can please. On him Our grosse dull common Flatt'ries passe, Ever most Joyfull, when most made an Asse. Heavy, to apprehend, though all Mankinde Perceave Us false, the Fopp concern'd is blinde, Who doating on himselfe, Thinkes ev'ry one, that sees him, of his mynde. These are true Womens Men.—Here forc'd, to cease Through Want of Breath, not Will, to hold her peace, Shee to the Window runns, where she had spy'de Her much esteem'd deare Freind the Monkey ti'de. With fourty smiles, as many Antique bows, As if't had beene the Lady of the House, The dirty chatt'ring Monster she embrac't, And made it this fine tender speech att last Kisse mee, thou curious Miniature of Man; How odde thou art? How pritty? How Japan? Oh I could live, and dye with thee—then on For halfe an houre in Complement shee runne. I tooke this tyme, to thinke, what Nature meant, When this mixt thinge into the World shee sent, Soe very wise, yet soe impertinent. One, who knew ev'ry thinge, who, God thought fitt, Should bee an Asse through choyce, not want of Witt: Whose Foppery, without the helpe of Sense, Could ne're have rose to such an Excellence. Nature's as lame, in making a true Fopp, As a Philosopher; the very topp, And Dignity of Folly wee attaine By studious Search, and labour of the Braine, By observation, Councell, and deepe thought: God never made a Coxecombe worth a groate. Wee owe that name to Industry, and Arts: An Eminent Foole must bee a Foole of parts; And such a one was shee, who had turn'd o're As many Bookes, as Men, lov'd much, reade more, Had a discerning Witt; to her was knowne Ev'ry ones fault, and meritt, but her owne. All the good qualityes, that ever blest A Woman, soe distinguisht from the rest, Except discretion onely, she possest. But now, mon cher, deare Pugge, she cryes, adiew, And the Discourse broke off does thus renew. You smile, to see mee, whom the World perchance Mistakes, to have some Witt, soe far advance The Interest of Fooles, that I approve Their Meritt more, then Mens of Witt, in Love. But in Our Sexe too many proofes there are Of such, whom Witts undoe, and Fooles repayre. This in my tyme was soe observ'd a Rule, Hardly a Wench in Towne, but had her Foole. The meanest Common Slutt, who long was growne The Jest, and Scorne of ev'ry Pitt-Buffoone, Had yet left Charmes enough, to have subdu'd Some Fopp, or other fond, to be thought lewd. Foster could make an Irish Lord a Nokes, And Betty Morris had her Citty-Cokes. A Woman's ne're soe ruyn'd, but she can Be still reveng'd on her undoer Man. How lost so e're, shee'l fynde some Lover more A lewde abandon'd Foole, then shee a whore. That wretched thinge Corinna, who had run Through all the severall Wayes of being undone, Couzen'd att first by Love, and living then By turning the too-deare-bought trick on Men: Gay were the houres, and wing'd with Joyes they flew, When first the Towne her early Beautyes knew, Courted, admir'd, and lov'd, with presents fedd, Youth in her lookes, and pleasure in her bed, Till Fate, or her ill Angell thought it fitt, To make her doate upon a Man of Witt, Who found, 'twas dull, to love above a day, Made his ill-natur'd Jest, and went away. Now scorn'd by all, forsaken, and opprest, Shee's a Memento Mori to the rest. Diseas'd, decay'd, to take up halfe a Crowne, Must morgage her long Scarfe, and Mantua Gowne. Poore Creature! Who unheard off, as a Flye, In some darke hole must all the Winter lye, And Want, and dirt endure a whole halfe yeare, That for one Moneth shee tawdry may appeare. In Easter Terme she getts her a new Gowne, When my young Masters Worship comes to Towne, From Pedagogue, and Mother just sett free, The Heyre, and Hopes of a great Family, Which with strong Ale, and Beefe the Countrey Rules, And ever synce the Conquest have been Fooles: And now with carefull prospect to mainteyne This Character, least crossing of the Strayne Should mend the Booby-breede, his Freinds provide A Cousin of his owne, to bee his Bride; And thus sett out— With an Estate, noe Witt, and a younge Wife (The solid comforts of a Coxecombes life) Dunghill, and Pease forsooke, he comes to Towne, Turnes Sparke, learnes to be lewd, and is undone. Nothing suites worse with Vice, then want of Sense, Fooles are still wicked att their owne Expence. This o'regrowne Schooleboy lost-Corinna wins, And att first dash, to make an Asse, begins: Pretends, to like a Man, who has not knowne The Vanityes, nor Vices of the Towne, Fresh in his youth, and faithfull in his Love, Eager of Joyes, which he does seldome prove, Healthfull, and strong, he does noe paynes endure, But what the Fayre One, he adores, can cure. Gratefull for favours does the Sexe esteeme, And libells none, for being kind to him. Then of the Lewdnesse of the tymes complaines, Rayles att the Witts, and Atheists, and mainteynes, 'Tis better, then good Sense, then pow'r, or Wealth, To have a love untainted, youth, and health. The unbred puppy, who had never seene A Creature looke soe gay, or talke soe fine, Beleaves, then falls in Love, and then in Debt, Morgages all, e'ne to th'Auncient Seate, To buy this Mistresse a new house for life; To give her Plate, and Jewells, robbs his wife; And when to the height of fondnesse he is growne, 'Tis tyme, to poyson him, and all's her owne. Thus meeting in her Common Armes his Fate, Hee leaves her Bastard Heyre to his Estate; And as the Race of such an Owle deserves, His owne dull lawfull progeny he starves. Nature, who never made a thinge in vayne, But does each Insect to some ende ordeyne, Wisely contriv'd kind-keeping Fooles, noe doubt, To patch up Vices, Men of Witt weare out. Thus she ranne on two howres, some graynes of Sense Still mixt with Volleys of Impertinence. But now 'tis tyme, I should some pitty show To Chloe, synce I cannot choose, but know, Readers must reape the dullnesse, writers sow. By the next Post such storyes I will tell, As joyn'd with these shall to a Volume swell, As true, as Heaven, more infamous, then Hell; But you are tyr'd, and soe am I. Farewell. [[Fragment of a Satire on Men]] What vaine unnecessary things are men How well we doe with out 'em, tell me then Whence comes that meane submissivness wee finde This ill bred age has wrought on womankinde Fall'n from the rights their sex and beautyes gave To make men wish despaire and humbly crave Now 'twill suffice if they vouchsafe to have, To the pell Mell, Playhous and the drawing roome Their Woemen Fayres, these Woemen Coursers come To chaffer, chuse and ride theire bargaines home, Att the appearance of an unknown face Up steps the Arrogant pretending ass Pulling by th'elbow his companion Huff Cryes Looke, de God that wench is well enough Faire and well shap't, good lipps and teeth 'twill doe Shee shall bee Tawdry for a month or two Att my expence, bee rude and take upon her Shew her contempt of quallity and honour And with the generall fate of errant Woman Bee very proude awhile, then very Common E're beare this scorne, I'de bee shutt up at home Content with humoring my selfe alone, Force back the Humble Love of former dayes In pensive madrigalls and ends of playes When if my Lady frown'd th'unhappy Knight was faine to fast and lye alone that night But whils't th'insulting wife the Breeches wore The Husband tooke her cloathes to give his— Who now maintaines it with a gentler art Thus Tyrranyes to Commonwealths Convert Then after all you finde what ere wee say Things must goe on in their Lewd naturall way Besides the Beastly men wee dayly see Can Please themselves alone as well as wee Therfore kind Ladyes of the towne to you for our stol'n ravish't men wee hereby sue By this time you have found out wee suppose That they're as Errant Tinsell as their Cloathes Poore broaken Propertyes that cannot serve To treate such persons soe as they deserve Mistake us not wee doe not here pretend That like the young sparkes you can condescend To Love a beastly playhous Creature, Foh Wee dare not thinke soe meanly of you, noe 'Tis not the Player pleases but the Part Shee may like Rollo who despises Hart To Theaters as Temples you are brought Where Love is worshipt and his precepts taught You must goe home and practice, for 'tis here Just as in other preaching places, where Greate Eloquence is show'n gainst sin, and Papists By men who Live Idolaters and Atheists. These two were dainty trades indeed could each Live up to halfe the miracles they teach Both are a SATYR. [Were I (who to my cost already am] Were I (who to my cost already am One of those strange prodigious Creatures Man) A Spirit free, to choose for my own share, What Case of Flesh, and Blood, I pleas'd to weare, I'd be a Dog, a Monkey, or a Bear, Or any thing but that vain Animal, Who is so proud of being rational. The senses are too gross, and he'll contrive A Sixth, to contradict the other Five; And before certain instinct, will preferr Reason, which Fifty times for one does err. Reason, an Ignis fatuus, in the Mind, Which leaving light of Nature, sense behind; Pathless and dang'rous wandring ways it takes, Through errors Fenny—Boggs, and Thorny Brakes; Whilst the misguided follower, climbs with pain, Mountains of Whimseys, heap'd in his own Brain: Stumbling from thought to thought, falls headlong down, Into doubts boundless Sea, where like to drown, Books bear him up awhile, and make him try, To swim with Bladders of Philosophy; In hopes still t'oretake th'escaping light, The Vapour dances in his dazling sight, Till spent, it leaves him to eternal Night. Then Old Age, and experience, hand in hand, Lead him to death, and make him understand, After a search so painful, and so long, That all his Life he has been in the wrong; Hudled in dirt, the reas'ning Engine lyes, Who was so proud, so witty, and so wise. Pride drew him in, as Cheats, their Bubbles catch, And makes him venture, to be made a Wretch. His wisdom did his happiness destroy, Aiming to know that World he shou'd enjoy; And Wit, was his vain frivolous pretence, Of pleasing others, at his own expence. For Witts are treated just like common Whores, First they're enjoy'd, and then kickt out of Doores: The pleasure past, a threatning doubt remains, That frights th'enjoyer, with succeeding pains: Women and Men of Wit, are dang'rous Tools, And ever fatal to admiring Fools. Pleasure allures, and when the Fopps escape, 'Tis not that they're belov'd, but fortunate, And therefore what they fear, at heart they hate. But now methinks some formal Band, and Beard, Takes me to task, come on Sir I'm prepar'd. Then by your favour, any thing that's writ Against this gibeing jingling knack call'd Wit, Likes me abundantly, but you take care, Upon this point, not to be too severe. Perhaps my Muse, were fitter for this part, For I profess, I can be very smart On Wit, which I abhor with all my heart: I long to lash it in some sharp Essay, But your grand indiscretion bids me stay, And turns my Tide of Ink another way. What rage ferments in your degen'rate mind, To make you rail at Reason, and Mankind? Blest glorious Man! to whom alone kind Heav'n, An everlasting Soul has freely giv'n; Whom his great Maker took such care to make, That from himself he did the Image take; And this fair frame, in shining Reason drest, To dignifie his Nature, above Beast. Reason, by whose aspiring influence, We take a flight beyond material sense, Dive into Mysteries, then soaring pierce, The flaming limits of the Universe, Search Heav'n and Hell, find out what's acted there, And give the World true grounds of hope and fear. Hold mighty Man, I cry, all this we know, From the Pathetique Pen of Ingello; From Patricks Pilgrim, Stilling fleets replyes, And 'tis this very reason I despise. This supernatural gift, that makes a Myte—, Think he's the Image of the Infinite: Comparing his short life, void of all rest, To the Eternal, and the ever blest. This busie, puzling, stirrer up of doubt, That frames deep Mysteries, then finds 'em out; Filling with Frantick Crowds of thinking Fools, Those Reverend Bedlams, Colledges, and Schools; Borne on whose Wings, each heavy Sot can pierce, The limits of the boundless Universe. So charming Oyntments, make an Old Witch flie, And bear a Crippled Carcass through the Skie. 'Tis this exalted Pow'r, whose bus'ness lies, In Nonsense, and impossibilities. This made a Whimsical Philosopher, Before the spacious World, his Tub prefer, And we have modern Cloysterd Coxcombs, who Retire to think, cause they have naught to do. But thoughts, are giv'n, for Actions government, Where Action ceases, thoughts impertinent: Our Sphere of Action, is lifes happiness, And he who thinks Beyond, thinks like an Ass. Thus, whilst against false reas'ning I inveigh, I own right Reason, which I wou'd obey: That Reason that distinguishes by sense, And gives us Rules, of good, and ill from thence: That bounds desires, with a reforming Will, To keep 'em more in vigour, not to kill. Your Reason hinders, mine helps t'enjoy, Renewing Appetites, yours wou'd destroy. My Reason is my Friend, yours is a Cheat, Hunger call's out, my Reason bids me eat; Perversly yours, your Appetite does mock, This asks for Food, that answers what's a Clock? This plain distinction Sir your doubt secures, 'Tis not true Reason I despise but yours. Thus I think Reason righted, but for Man, I'le nere recant defend him if you can. For all his Pride, and his Philosophy, 'Tis evident, Beasts are in their degree, As wise at least, and better far than he. Those Creatures, are the wisest who attain, By surest means, the ends at which they aim. If therefore Jowler, finds, and Kills his Hares, Better than Meres, supplyes Committee Chairs; Though one's a States-man, th'other but a Hound, Jowler, in Justice, wou'd be wiser found. You see how far Mans wisedom here extends, Look next, if humane Nature makes amends; Whose Principles, most gen'rous are, and just, And to whose Moralls, you wou'd sooner trust. Be judge your self, I'le bring it to the test, Which is the basest Creature Man, or Beast? Birds, feed on Birds, Beasts, on each other prey, But Savage Man alone, does Man, betray: Prest by necessity, they Kill for Food, Man, undoes Man, to do himself no good. With Teeth, and Claws, by Nature arm'd they hunt, Natures allowance, to supply their want. But Man, with smiles, embraces, Friendships, praise, Unhumanely his Fellows life betrays; With voluntary pains, works his distress, Not through necessity, but wantonness. For hunger, or for Love, they fight, or tear, Whilst wretched Man, is still in Arms for fear; For fear he armes, and is of Armes afraid, By fear, to fear, successively betray'd. Base fear, the source whence his best passion came, His boasted Honor, and his dear bought Fame. That lust of Pow'r, to which he's such a Slave, And for the which alone he dares be brave: To which his various Projects are design'd, Which makes him gen'rous, affable, and kind. For which he takes such pains to be thought wise, And screws his actions, in a forc'd disguise: Leading a tedious life in Misery, Under laborious, mean Hypocrisie. Look to the bottom, of his vast design, Wherein Mans Wisdom, Pow'r, and Glory joyn; The good he acts, the ill he does endure, 'Tis all for fear, to make himself secure. Meerly for safety, after Fame we thirst, For all Men, wou'd be Cowards if they durst. And honesty's against all common sense, Men must be Knaves, 'tis in their own defence. Mankind's dishonest, if you think it fair, Amongst known Cheats, to play upon the square, You'le be undone— Nor can weak truth, your reputation save, The Knaves, will all agree to call you Knave. Wrong'd shall he live, insulted o're, opprest, Who dares be less a Villain, than the rest. Thus Sir you see what humane Nature craves, Most Men are Cowards, all Men shou'd be Knaves: The diff'rence lyes (as far as I can see) Not in the thing it self, but the degree; And all the subject matter of debate, Is only who's a Knave, of the first Rate? All this with indignation have I hurl'd, At the pretending part of the proud World, Who swolne with selfish vanity, devise, False freedomes, holy Cheats, and formal Lyes Over their fellow Slaves to tyrannize. But if in Court, so just a Man there be, (In Court, a just Man, yet unknown to me) Who does his needful flattery direct, Not to oppress, and ruine, but protect; Since flattery, which way so ever laid, Is still a Tax on that unhappy Trade. If so upright a States-Man, you can find, Whose passions bend to his unbyass'd Mind; Who does his Arts, and Pollicies apply, To raise his Country, not his Family; Nor while his Pride own'd Avarice withstands, Receives close Bribes, from Friends corrupted hands. Is there a Church-Man who on God relyes? Whose Life, his Faith, and Doctrine Justifies? Not one blown up, with vain Prelatique Pride, Who for reproof of Sins, does Man deride: Whose envious heart makes preaching a pretence With his obstrep'rous sawcy Eloquence, To chide at Kings, and raile at Men of sense. Who from his Pulpit, vents more peevish Lyes, More bitter railings, scandals, Calumnies, Than at a Gossipping, are thrown about, When the good Wives, get drunk, and then fall out. None of that sensual Tribe, whose Tallents lye, In Avarice, Pride, Sloth, and Gluttony. Who hunt good Livings, but abhor good Lives, Whose Lust exalted, to that height arrives, They act Adultery with their own Wives. And e're a score of Years compleated be, Can from the lofty Pulpit proudly see, Half a large Parish, their own Progeny. Nor doating Bishop who wou'd be ador'd, For domineering at the Councel Board; A greater Fop, in business at Fourscore, Fonder of serious Toyes, affected more, Than the gay glitt'ring Fool, at Twenty proves, With all his noise, his tawdrey Cloths, and Loves. But a meek humble Man, of honest sense, Who Preaching peace, does practice continence; Whose pious life's a proof he does believe, Misterious truths, which no Man can conceive. If upon Earth there dwell such God-like Men, I'le here recant my Paradox to them, Adore those Shrines of Virtue, Homage pay, And with the Rabble World, their Laws obey. If such there are, yet grant me this at least, Man differs more from Man, than Man from Beast. The Disabled Debauchee. As some brave Admiral, in former War, Depriv'd of force, but prest with courage still, Two Rival-Fleets, appearing from a far, Crawles to the top of an adjacent Hill: From whence (with thoughts full of concern) he views The wise, and daring Conduct of the fight, And each bold Action, to his Mind renews, His present glory, and his past delight; From his fierce Eyes, flashes of rage he throws, As from black Clouds, when Lightning breaks away, Transported, thinks himself amidst his Foes, And absent, yet enjoys the Bloody Day; So when my Days of impotence approach, And I'm by Pox, and Wines unlucky chance, Forc'd from the pleasing Billows of debauch, On the dull Shore of lazy temperance, My pains at least some respite shall afford, Whilst I behold the Battails you maintain, When Fleets of Glasses, sail about the Board, From whose Broad-sides Volleys of Wit shall rain. Nor let the sight of Honourable Scars, Which my too forward Valour did procure, Frighten new-listed Souldiers from the Warrs, Past joys have more than paid what I endure. Shou'd any Youth (worth being drunk) prove nice, And from his fair Inviter meanly shrink, 'Twill please the Ghost, of my departed Vice, If at my Councel, he repent and drink. Or shou'd some cold complexion'd Sot forbid, With his dull Morals, our Nights brisk Alarmes, I'll fire his Blood by telling what I did, When I was strong, and able to bear Armes. I'll tell of Whores attacqu'd, their Lords at home, Bawds Quarters beaten up, and Fortress won, Windows demolisht, Watches overcome, And handsome ills, by my contrivance done. Nor shall our Love-fits Cloris be forgot, When each the well-look'd Link-Boy, strove t'enjoy, And the best Kiss, was the deciding Lot, Whether the Boy fuck'd you, or I the Boy. With Tales like these, I will such thoughts inspire, As to important mischief shall incline. I'll make him long some Antient Church to fire, And fear no lewdness he's called to by Wine. Thus States-man-like, I'll sawcily impose, And safe from Action valiantly advise, Shelter'd in impotence, urge you to blows, And being good for nothing else, be wise. An Allusion to Horace. The 10th Satyr of the 1st. Book. Nempe incomposito Dixi pede etc. Well Sir, 'tis granted, I said Dryden's Rhimes, Were stoln, unequal, nay dull many times: What foolish Patron, is there found of his, So blindly partial, to deny me this? But that his Plays, Embroider'd up and downe, With Witt, and Learning, justly pleas'd the Towne, In the same paper, I as freely owne: Yet haveing this allow'd, the heavy Masse, That stuffs up his loose Volumes must not passe: For by that Rule, I might as well admit, Crownes tedious Scenes, for Poetry, and Witt. 'Tis therefore not enough, when your false Sense Hits the false Judgment of an Audience Of Clapping-Fooles, assembling a vast Crowd 'Till the throng'd Play-House, crack with the dull Load; Tho' ev'n that Tallent, merrits in some sort, That can divert the Rabble and the Court: Which blundring Settle, never cou'd attaine, And puzling Otway, labours at in vaine. But within due proportions, circumscribe What e're you write; that with a flowing Tyde, The Stile, may rise, yet in its rise forbeare, With uselesse Words, t'oppresse the wearyed Eare: Here be your Language lofty, there more light, Your Rethorick, with your Poetry, unite: For Elegance sake, sometimes alay the force Of Epethets; 'twill soften the discourse; A Jeast in Scorne, poynts out, and hits the thing, More home, than the Morosest Satyrs Sting. Shakespeare, and Johnson, did herein excell, And might in this be Immitated well; Whom refin'd Etheridge, Coppys not at all, But is himself a Sheere Originall: Nor that Slow Drudge, in swift Pindarique straines, Flatman, who Cowley imitates with paines, And rides a Jaded Muse, whipt with loose Raines. When Lee, makes temp'rate Scipio, fret and Rave, And Haniball, a whineing Am'rous Slave; I laugh, and wish the hot-brain'd Fustian Foole, In Busbys hands, to be well lasht at Schoole. Of all our Moderne Witts, none seemes to me, Once to have toucht upon true Comedy, But hasty Shadwell, and slow Witcherley. Shadwells unfinisht workes doe yet impart, Great proofes of force of Nature, none of Art. With just bold Stroakes, he dashes here and there, Shewing great Mastery with little care; And scornes to varnish his good touches o're, To make the Fooles, and Women, praise 'em more. But Witcherley, earnes hard, what e're he gaines, He wants noe Judgment, nor he spares noe paines; He frequently excells, and at the least, Makes fewer faults, than any of the best. Waller, by Nature for the Bayes design'd, With force, and fire, and fancy unconfin'd, In Panigericks does Excell Mankind: He best can turne, enforce, and soften things, To praise great Conqu'rours, or to flatter Kings. For poynted Satyrs, I wou'd Buckhurst choose, The best good Man, with the worst Natur'd Muse: For Songs, and Verses, Mannerly Obscene, That can stirr Nature up, by Springs unseene, And without forceing blushes, warme the Queene: Sidley, has that prevailing gentle Art, That can with a resistlesse Charme impart, The loosest wishes to the Chastest Heart, Raise such a Conflict, kindle such a ffire Betwixt declineing Virtue, and desire, Till the poor Vanquisht Maid, dissolves away, In Dreames all Night, in Sighs, and Teares, all Day. Dryden, in vaine, try'd this nice way of Witt, For he, to be a tearing Blade thought fit, But when he wou'd be sharp, he still was blunt, To friske his frollique fancy, hed cry Cunt; Wou'd give the Ladyes, a dry Bawdy bob, And thus he got the name of Poet Squab: But to be just, twill to his praise be found, His Excellencies, more than faults abound. Nor dare I from his Sacred Temples teare, That Lawrell, which he best deserves to weare. But does not Dryden find ev'n Johnson dull? Fletcher, and Beaumont, uncorrect, and full Of Lewd lines as he calls em? Shakespeares Stile Stiffe, and Affected? To his owne the while Allowing all the justnesse that his Pride, Soe Arrogantly, had to these denyd? And may not I, have leave Impartially To search, and Censure, Drydens workes, and try, If those grosse faults, his Choyce Pen does Commit Proceed from want of Judgment, or of Witt. Of if his lumpish fancy does refuse, Spirit, and grace to his loose slatterne Muse? Five Hundred Verses, ev'ry Morning writ, Proves you noe more a Poet, than a Witt. Such scribling Authors, have beene seene before, Mustapha, the English Princesse, Forty more, Were things perhaps compos'd in Half an Houre. To write what may securely stand the test Of being well read over Thrice at least Compare each Phrase, examin ev'ry Line, Weigh ev'ry word, and ev'ry thought refine; Scorne all Applause the Vile Rout can bestow, And be content to please those few, who know. Canst thou be such a vaine mistaken thing To wish thy Workes might make a Play-house ring, With the unthinking Laughter, and poor praise Of Fopps, and Ladys, factious for thy Plays? Then send a cunning Friend to learne thy doome, From the shrew'd Judges in the Drawing-Roome. I've noe Ambition on that idle score, But say with Betty Morice, heretofore When a Court-Lady, call'd her Buckleys Whore, I please one Man of Witt, am proud on't too, Let all the Coxcombs, dance to bed to you. Shou'd I be troubled when the Purblind Knight Who squints more in his Judgment, than his sight, Picks silly faults, and Censures what I write? Or when the poor-fed Poets of the Towne For Scrapps, and Coach roome cry my Verses downe? I loath the Rabble, 'tis enough for me, If Sidley, Shadwell, Shepherd, Witcherley, Godolphin, Buttler, Buckhurst, Buckingham, And some few more, whom I omit to name Approve my Sense, I count their Censure Fame. Dialogue. Nell When to the King I bid good Morrow, With Tongue in Mouth, and Hand on Tarse, Portsmouth may rend her Cunt for Sorrow, And Mazarine may kisse myne Arse.

      <field name="fulltext">POEMS to MULGRAVE and SCROOPE An Epistolary Essay Deare Friend. I heare this Towne does soe abound, With sawcy Censurers, that faults are found, With what of late wee (in Poetique Rage) Bestowing, threw away on the dull Age; But (howsoe're Envy, their Spleen may raise, To Robb my Brow, of the deserved Bays) Their thanks at least I merit since through me, They are Partakers of your Poetry; And this is all, I'll say in my defence, T'obtaine one Line, of your well worded Sense I'd be content t'have writ the Brittish Prince. I'm none of those who thinke themselves inspir'd, Nor write with the vaine hopes to be admir'd; But from a Rule (I have upon long tryall) T'avoyd with care, all sort of self denyall. Which way soe're desire and fancy leade (Contemning Fame) that Path I boldly tread; And if exposeing what I take for Witt, To my deare self, a Pleasure I beget, Noe matter tho' the Censring Crittique fret. Those whom my Muse displeases, are at strife With equall Spleene, against my Course of life, The least delight of which, I'd not forgoe, For all the flatt'ring Praise, Man can bestow. If I designd to please the way were then, To mend my Manners, rather than my Pen; The first's unnaturall, therefore unfit, And for the Second, I despair of it, Since Grace, is not soe hard to get as Witt. Perhaps ill Verses, ought to be confin'd, In meere good Breeding, like unsav'ry Wind; Were Reading forc'd, I shou'd be apt to thinke Men might noe more write scurvily, than stinke: But 'tis your choyce, whether you'll Read, or noe, If likewise of your smelling it were soe, I'd Fart just as I write, for my owne ease, Nor shou'd you be concern'd, unlesse you please: I'll owne, that you write better than I doe, But I have as much need to write, as you. What though the Excrement of my dull Braine, Runns in a harsh, insipid Straine, Whilst your rich Head, eases it self of Witt? Must none but Civet-Catts, have leave to shit? In all I write, shou'd Sense, and Witt, and Rhyme Faile me at once, yet something soe Sublime, Shall stamp my Poem, that the World may see, It cou'd have beene produc'd, by none but me. And that's my end, for Man, can wish noe more, Then soe to write, as none ere writ before. Yet why am I noe Poet, of the tymes? I have Allusions, Similies and Rhymes, And Witt, or else 'tis hard that I alone, Of the whole Race of Mankind, shou'd have none. Unequally, the Partiall Hand of Heav'n, Has all but this one only Blessing giv'n; The World appeares like a great Family, Whose Lord opprest with Pride, and Poverty, (That to a few, great Plenty he may show) Is faine to starve the Num'rous Traine below: Just soe seemes Providence, as poor and vaine, Keeping more Creatures, than it can maintaine. Here 'tis profuse, and there it meanly saves, And for One Prince, it makes Ten Thousand Slaves: In Witt alone, it has beene Magnificent, Of which, soe just a share, to each is sent That the most Avaricious are content. For none e're thought, (the due Division's such), His owne too little, or his Friends too much. Yet most Men shew, or find great want of Witt, Writeing themselves, or Judging what is writ: But I, who am of sprightly Vigour full Looke on Mankind, as Envious, and dull. Borne to my self, my self I like alone, And must conclude my Judgment good, or none. (For shou'd my Sense be nought, how cou'd I know, Whether another Man's, were good, or noe?) Thus, I resolve of my owne Poetry, That 'tis the best, and there's a Fame for me. If then I'm happy, what does it advance, Whether to merit due, or Arrogance? Oh! but the World will take offence thereby, Why then the World, shall suffer for't, not I. Did e're this sawcy World, and I agree? To let it have its Beastly will on me? Why shou'd my Prostituted Sense, be drawne, To ev'ry Rule, their musty Customes spawne? But Men, will Censure you; Tis Two to one When e're they Censure, they'll be in the wrong. There's not a thing on Earth, that I can name Soe foolish, and soe false, as Common Fame. It calls the Courtier Knave, the plaine Man rude, Haughty the grave, and the delightfull Lewd. Impertinent the briske, Morosse the sad, Meane the Familiar, the Reserv'd one Mad. Poor helplesse Woman, is not favour'd more She's a slye Hipocryte, or Publique Whore. Then who the Devill, wou'd give this—to be free From th'Innocent Reproach of Infamy? These things consider'd, make me (in despight Of idle Rumour,) keepe at home, and write. Song. [by Sir Carr Scroope] I cannot change as others do Though you unjustly scorn Since that poor Swayne that sighs for you For you alone was born. No Phillis, no, your Heart to move, A surer way I'll try And to revenge my slighted love Will still love on, will still love on, and dye. When kill'd with grief Amyntas lyes And you to mind shall call, The sighs that now unpittyd rise The Tears that vainly fall; That welcome hour that ends his smart Will then begin your pain, For such a faithful tender Heart Can never break, can never break in vain. The Mock Song. [by Rochester] I swive as well as others do, I'm young, not yet deform'd, My tender Heart, sincere, and true, Deserves not to be scorn'd. Why Phillis then, why will you swive, With Forty Lovers more? Can I (said she) with Nature strive, Alas I am, alas I am a Whore. Were all my Body larded o're, With Darts of love, so thick, That you might find in ev'ry Pore, A well stuck standing Prick; Whilst yet my Eyes alone were free, My Heart, wou'd never doubt, In Am'rous Rage, and Extasie, To wish those Eyes, to wish those Eyes fuckt out. Ephelia to Bajazet. [by Sir George Etherege] How farre are they deceiv'd who hope in vaine, A lasting Lease of joys, from Love t'obtaine? All the deare sweets, wee promise or expect, After Enjoyment, turnes to cold neglect: Cou'd Love, a constant happinesse have knowne, The mighty wonder had in me beene showne; Our Passions were soe favoured by Fate, As if she meant 'em an Eternall Date; Soe kind he look'd, such tender words he spoke, 'Twas past beliefe, such Vows shou'd e're be broke! Fixt on my Eyes, how often wou'd he say, He cou'd with pleasure, gaze an Age away! When thoughts too greate for words had made him Mute, In kisses, he wou'd tell my hand his Suite; Soe fierce his Passion was, soe farr above, The Common Gallantryes, that passe for Love; At worst I thought, if he unkind shoud prove, His ebbing Passion wou'd be kinder farr, Than the ffirst Transports, of all others are: Nor was my Love, weaker or lesse than his, In him I center'd all my hopes of Blisse! For him my Duty to my Friends forgot, For him I lost, alas, what lost I not! Fame, all the valuable things of life To meete his Love, by a lesse name than Wife! How happy was I then, how dearely blest, When this greate Man, lay panting on my Breast, Lookeing such things, as ne're can be exprest! Thousand fresh lookes, he gave me evry Houre, Whilst greedily I did his lookes devoure, Till quite or'ecome with Charmes, I trembling lay, At ev'ry looke he gave, melted away. I was soe highly happy in his Love, Methoughts, I pitty'd them that dwelt above. Thinke then, thou greatest, lovelyest, falsest Man, How you have vow'd, how I have lov'd, and then My faithlesse deare, be cruell if you can! How I have lov'd, I cannot, need not tell, Noe ev'ry Act has showne, I lov'd too well: Since first I saw you, I nere had a thought, Was not intirely yours, to you I brought, My Virgin Innocence, and freely made, My love an Off'ring to your Noble Bed: Since when, y'ave beene the Starr, by which I steer'd, And nothing else but you I lov'd, or feard; Your smiles I only live by, and I must, When e're you frowne, be shatter'd into Dust. Oh! can the coldnesse that you shew me now, Suite with the Generous heate you once did shew! I cannot live on pitty, or respect, A thought soe meane, wou'd my whole frame infect, Lesse than your Love, I scorne Sir to expect. Let me not live in dull indiff'rency, But give me Rage enough, to make me dye! For if from you, I needs must meete my Fate, Before your pitty, I wou'd choose your hate. A very Heroicall Epistle in Answer to Ephelia. Madam. If you're deceiv'd, it is not by my Cheate, For all Disguises, are below the greate; What Man, or Woman, upon Earth can say, I ever us'd 'em well above a Day? How is it then, that I inconstant am? He changes not, who allways, is the same. In my deare self, I center ev'ry thing, My Servants, Friends, my Mistresse and my King, Nay Heav'n, and Earth, to that one poynt I bring: Well-Manner'd, Honest, Generous and stout, (Names by dull Fooles, to plague Mankind found out) Shou'd I reguard, I must my self constraine, And 'tis my Maxim, to avoyd all paine; You fondly looke for what none e're cou'd find, Deceive your self, and then call me unkind; And by false Reasons, wou'd my falshood prove; For 'tis as Naturall, to change, as love: You may as justly at the Sun repine Because alike it does not allways shine; Noe glorious thing, was ever made to stay, My Blazeing Starr, but visits, and away: As fatall too, it shines, as those i'th' Skyes, Tis never seene, but some great Lady dyes. The boasted favour you soe precious hold, To me's noe more, than changeing of my Gold; What e're you gave, I paid you back in Blisse! Then where's the Obligation pray of this? If heretofore you found grace in my Eyes, Be thankfull for it, and let that suffice. But Women, Beggar-like, still haunt the Doore, Where they've receiv'd a Charity before. Oh happy Sultan! whom wee Barb'rous call! How much refin'd art thou above us all? Who Envys not the joys of thy Seraill? Thee, like some God, the trembling Crowd adore, Each Man's thy Slave, and Woman-kind, thy Whore. Methinkes I see thee underneath the shade, Of Golden Cannopies, supinely laid: Thy crowching Slaves, all silent as the Night, But at the Nod, all Active as the Light! Secure in Solid Sloth, thou there dost Reigne, And feel'st the joys of Love, without the paine: Each Female Courts thee with a wishing Eye, Whilst thou with Awfull Pride, walkst carelesse by, Till thy kind Pledge at last markes out the Dame, Thou fancy'st most to quench thy present flame: Then from thy Bed, submissive she retires, And thankfull for the Grace, noe more requires. Noe lowd reproach, nor fond unwelcome sound Of Womens Tongues, thy sacred Eare dares wound; If any doe, a nimble Mute strait tyes, The True-Love-Knot, and stops her foolish cryes. Thou fearst noe injur'd Kinsmans threatning Blade, Nor Midnight Ambushes, by Rivalls laid; While here with Akeing Heart, our joys wee taste, Disturb'd by Swords, like Democles his Feast. On the suppos'd Authour of a late Poem in defence of Satyr. To rack, and torture thy unmeaning Brain, In Satyrs praise, to a low untun'd strain, In thee was most impertinent and vain. When in thy Person, we more clearly see, That Satyr's of Divine Authority, For God, made one on Man, when he made thee. To shew there are some Men, as there are Apes, Fram'd for meer sport, who differ but in shapes: In thee are all those contradictions joyn'd, That make an Asse, prodigious and refin'd. A lump deform'd, and shapeless wert thou born, Begot in Loves despight, and Natures scorn; And art grown up, the most ungraceful Wight, Harsh to the Ear, and hideous to the sight, Yet Love's thy bus'ness, Beauty thy delight. Curse on that silly hour, that first inspir'd, Thy madness, to pretend to be admir'd; To paint thy grizly Face, to dance, to dress, And all those Awkward Follies that express, Thy loathsome Love, and filthy daintiness. Who needs will be an Ugly Beau-Garcon, Spit at, and shun'd, by ev'ry Girl in Town; Where dreadfully Loves Scare-Crow, thou art plac'd To fright the tender Flock, that long to taste: While ev'ry coming Maid, when you appear, Starts back for shame, and strait turns chaste for fear. For none so poor, or Prostitute have prov'd, Where you made love, t'endure to be belov'd. 'Twere labour lost, or else I wou'd advise. But thy half Wit, will ne're let thee be wise. Half-witty, and half-mad, and scarce half-brave, Half-honest (which is very much a Knave.) Made up of all these Halfs, thou can'st not pass, For any thing intirely, but an Asse. The Answer. [by Sir Carr Scroope] Raile on poor feeble Scribbler, speake of me, In as bad Terms as the World speakes of thee; Sit swelling in thy hole, like a vext Toad, And full of Pox, and Mallice spit abroad. Thou canst blast noe Mans Fame with thy ill word, Thy Pen, is full as harmlesse as thy Sword. On Poet Ninny. Crusht by that just contempt his Follys bring On his Crazd Head, the Vermin faine wou'd sting; But never Satyr, did soe softly bite, Or gentle George, himself, more gently write. Borne to noe other, but thy owne disgrace, Thou art a thing soe wretched, and soe base, Thou canst not ev'n offend, but with thy face: And dost at once, a sad Example prove, Of harmlesse Malice, and of hoplesse Love. All Pride, and Uglinesse! Oh how wee loath, A nauseous Creature soe compos'd of both! How oft' have wee thy Cap'ring Person seene, With dismall looke, and Melacholly Meene? The just Reverse of Noakes, when he wou'd be, Some mighty Heroe, and makes Love, like thee. Thou art below being laught at, out of spight, Men gaze upon thee, as a hideous sight, And cry, there goes the Melancholly Knight. There are some Modish Fooles, wee dayly see, Modest, and dull; why they are Witts to thee! For of all Folly, sure the very topp, Is a conceited Ninny, and a Fopp. With Face, of Farce, joyn'd to a head Romancy, There's noe such Coxcomb, as your Foole of fancy. But 'tis too much, on soe despis'd a Theame; Noe Man, wou'd dabble in a dirty Streame: The worst that I cou'd write, wou'd be noe more, Then what thy very Friends have said before. My Lord All-Pride. Bursting with Pride, the loath'd Impostume swells, Prick him, he sheds his Venom strait, and smells; But tis soe Lewd a Scribler, that he writes, With as much force to Nature, as he fights. Harden'd in shame, tis such a Baffl'd Fopp, That ev'ry Schoole-Boy, whips him like a Topp. And with his Arme, and Head, his Brain's soe weake That his starv'd Fancy, is compell'd to rake, Among the Excrements of others Witt, To make a stinking Meale of what they Shitt. Soe Swine, for nasty Meat, to Dunghill runn, And tosse their gruntling Snowts up, when theyve done. Against his Starrs, the Coxcomb ever strives, And to be something they forbid, contrives; With a Red Nose, Splay Foot, and Goggle Eye, A Plough-Mans Looby Meene, Face all awry, With stinking Breathe, and ev'ry Loathsome marke, The Punch'anello, sets up for a Sparke. With equall Self-conceit too, he beares Armes, But with that vile successe, his part performes, That he Burlesques his Trade, and what is best In others, turnes like Harlequin to Jeast. Soe have I seene at Smithfeilds wondrous Fair, (When all his Brother-Monsters flourish there) A Lubbard Elephant, divert the Town, With makeing Leggs, and shooting off a Gun. Goe where he will, he never finds a Friend, Shame, and derision all his Steps attend: Alike abroad, at home, i'th' Camp, and Court, This Knight o'th' Burning Pestle makes us sport.</field>

Upon Cary Frazer Her Father gave her Dildoes six; Her Mother made 'um up a score: But she loves nought but living pricks And swears by God sheel frig no more. The Earl of ROCHESTER's Answer, to a Paper of Verses, sent him by L. B. Felton, and taken out of the Translation of Ovid's Epistles, 1680. What strange Surprise to meet such Words as these? Such Terms of Horrour were ne'er chose to please: To meet, midst Pleasures of a Jovial Night, Words that can only give amaze and fright, No gentle thought that does to Love invite. Were it not better far your Arms t'employ, Grasping a Lover in pursuit of Joy, Than handling Sword, and Pen, Weapons unfit: Your Sex gains Conquest, by their Charms and Wit. Of Writers slain I could with pleasure hear, Approve of Fights, o'er-joy'd to cause a Tear; So slain, I mean, that she should soon revive, Pleas'd in my Arms to find her self Alive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS POSSIBLY BY ROCHESTER Anacreontic. [The Heaven drinks each Day a Cup] The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Heaven drinks each Day a Cup, No Wonder Atlas holds her up. The Trees suck up the Earth and Ground, And in their Brown Bowls drink around. The Sea too, whom the Salt makes dry, His greedy thirst to satisfy, Ten Thousand Rivers drinks, and then He's drunk, and spews them up again. The Sun (and who so right as he) Sits up all Night to drink the Sea. The Moon quaffs up the Sun, her Brother, And wishes she cou'd tope another. Ev'ry Thing fuddles; then that I, Is't any Reason should be dry? Well; I'le be content to Thirst, But too much Drink shall make me first. On Rome's Pardons. The attribution of this poem is questionable. If Rome can pardon Sins, as Romans hold, And if those Pardons, can be bought and sold, It were no Sin, t'adore, and worship Gold. If they can purchase Pardons with a Sum, For Sins they may commit in time to come, And for Sins past, 'tis very well for Rome. At this rate they are happy'st that have most; They'll purchase Heav'n, at their own proper cost, Alas! the Poor! all that are so are lost. Whence came this knack, or when did it begin? What Author have they, or who brought it in? Did Christ, e're keep a Custom-house for Sin? Some subtle Devil, without more ado, Did certainly this sly invention brew, To gull 'em of their Souls, and Money too. To His MISTRESS. The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Why do'st thou shade thy lovely face? O why Does that Eclipsing hand of thine deny The Sun-shine of the Suns enlivening Eye. II Without thy light, what light remains in me Thou art my Life, my way my Light's in Thee, I Live I move and by thy beams I see. III Thou art my Life, if thou but turn away My Life's a thousand Deaths, thou art my way Without Thee (Love) I travel not but Stray. IV My Light thou art, without thy Glorious sight My Eyes are Darkned with Eternal night My Love Thou art my way, my Life my light. V Thou are my way I wander if thou fly Thou art my Light, if hid how blind am I Thou art my Life if thou withdraw'st I Die. VI My Eyes are dark and blind I cannot see To whom or whether should my darkness flee But to that Light, and who's that Light but Thee. VII If that be all Shine forth and draw thou nigher Let me be bold and Dye for my desire A Phenix likes to Perish in the Fire. VIII If my Puft Light be out give leave to— My Shameless Snuff at the bright Lamp of thine Ah! what's thy Light the less for Lighting mine. IX If I have lost my Path dear Lover say Shall I still wander in a Doubtful way Love shall a Lamb of Israel's Sheepfold Stray. X My Path is lost my wandring Steps does Stray I cannot go nor safely Stay Whom should I seek but Thee my Path my Way. XI And yet thou turn'st thy Face a way and flyest me And yet I sue for Grace and thou deniest me Speak art thou angry, Love or tryest me. XII Display those Heavenly Lamps, or tell me why Thou Shad'st my Face perhaps no Eye Can View their Flames and not drop down and Die. XIII Thou art the Pilgrims Path and Blind-Mans Eye The Dead Mans Life on Thee my hopes rely If I but them remove I e'er I Die. XIV Disolve thy Sun-Beams close thy Wings and Stay See See how I am blind and Dead and Stray Oh thou that art my Life my Light my way. XV Then work my will if Passion bid me flee My Reason shall obey my Wings shall be Stretched out no further then from me to thee. Regime d'viver The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Rise at Eleven, I Dine about Two, I get drunk before Seven, and the next thing I do, I send for my Whore, when for fear of a Clap, I Spend in her hand, and I Spew in her Lap: Then we quarrel, and scold, till I fall fast asleep, When the Bitch, growing bold, to my Pocket does creep; Then slyly she leaves me, and to revenge th'affront, At once she bereaves me of Money, and Cunt. If by chance then I wake, hot-headed, and drunk, What a coyle do I make for the loss of my Punck? I storm and I roar, and I fall in a rage, And missing my Whore, I bugger my Page: Then crop-sick, all Morning, I rail at my Men, And in Bed I lye Yawning, till Eleven again. Against Marriage The attribution of this poem is questionable. Out of meer Love and arrant Devotion Of Marriage Ile give you this Galloping Notion, It's the bane of all business the end of all Pleasure, The consumption of Witt, Youth, Vertue and Treasure. It's the Rack of our Thoughts the Nightmare of sleep, That setts us to work before the day Peep. It makes us make brick without stubble or straw, And a Cunt has no sence of conscience or law. If you needs must have Flesh, take the way that is noble In a generous Wench theres nothing of Trouble, You come on, you come off say do what you pleas, The worst you can fear is but a Disease: And diseases you know will admitt of a cure, But the Hellfire of Marriage the Damn'd do indure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX I A Session of the Poets. Since the Sons of the Muses, grow num'rous and lowd For th'appeasing soe Clam'rous, and Factious a Crowd; Apollo, thought fit, in soe weighty a Cause, T'Establish a Government, Leader, and Laws: The hopes of the Bayes, at this Summoning Call, Had drawne 'em together, the Devill and all; All thronging and listning, they gap'd for the Blessing, Noe Presbyter Sermon, had more Crowding and pressing. In the head of the Gang, John Dryden, appear'd, That Antient grave Witt, soe long lov'd and fear'd; But Apollo, had heard a Story i'th' Town, Of his quitting the Muses, to weare the black Gowne; And soe gave him leave, now his Poetry's done, To let him turne Priest, when Reeves is turn'd Nun. This Reverend Author, was noe sooner set by, But Apollo had got gentle George, in his Eye; And franckly confest, of all Men that writ, There's none had more fancy, Sense, Judgment and Witt: But ith' Crying-Sin idlenesse, he was soe hardne'd That his long Seav'n yeares silence, was not to be Pardon'd. Brawney Witcherley was the next Man shewd his Face, But Apollo, e'ene thought him too good for the Place; Noe Gentleman-Writer, that Office shou'd beare, 'Twas a Trader in Witt, the Lawrell shou'd weare, As none but a Citt, er'e makes a Lord Major. Next into the Crowd, Tom Shadwell, does wallow, And sweares by his Gutts, his Paunch, and his Tallow, 'Tis he that alone, best pleases the Age, Himself and his Wife, have supported the Stage. Apollo well pleas'd with soe Bonny a Lad, T'oblige him, he told him he shou'd be huge glad, Had he Half soe much Witt, as he fancy'd he had. How ever to please soe Joviall a Witt, And to keepe him in humour, Apollo thought fit, To bid him drinke on, and keepe his Old trick Of Railing at Poets, and shewing his Prick. Natt. Lee, stept in next, in hopes of a Prize, Apollo remember'd he had hit once in Thrice; By the Rubyes in's Face, he cou'd not deny, He had as much Witt, as Wine cou'd supply; Confest that indeed, he had a Musicall Note, But sometimes strain'd soe hard, that he rattled i'th' Throat. Yet owning he had Sense, t'encourage him for't, He made him his Ovid, in Augustus's Court. Poet Settle, his Tryall, was the next came about, He brought him an Ibrahim, with the Preface, torne out; And humbly desir'd he might give noe offence. God Damme, cryes Shadwell, he cannot write Sense. And Ballocks, cry'd Newport, I hate that dull Rogue. Apollo, consid'ring he was not in Vogue, Wou'd not trust his deare Bayes, with soe modest a Foole, And bid the great Boy, shou'd be sent back to Schoole. Tom Otway, came next, Tom Shadwells, deare Zany, And sweares for Heroicks, he writes best of any: Don Carlos, his Pockets, soe Amply had fill'd, That his Mange, was quite cur'd, and his Lice were all kill'd. But Apollo, had seene his face on the Stage, And prudently did not thinke fit to engage, The Scumm of a Play-House, for the prop of an Age. In the Numerous Herd, that encompast him round, Little Starcht-Johnny Crowne, at his Elbow he found; His Crevat-string new Iron'd, he gently did stretch His Lilly white hand out, the Lawrell to reach; Aledging that he had most right to the Bayes, For writeing Romances, and shiteing of Plays. Apollo rose up, and gravely confest, Of all Men that writ, his Tallent was best; For since paine and dishonour, Mans life only Damn, The greatest Felicity, Mankind can claime, Is to want sense of smart, and be past Sense of Shame: And to perfect his Blisse, in Poeticall Rapture, He bid him be dull, to the end of the Chapter. The Poetesse Afra, next shew'd her sweete face, And swore by her Poetry, and her black Ace; The Lawrell, by a double right was her owne, For the Plays she had writ, and the Conquests she had won. Apollo acknowledg'd, 'twas hard to deny her, But to deale franckly, and Ingeniously by her, He told her, were Conquests, and Charmes her pretence, She ought to have pleaded a Douzen yeares since. At last Mamamouchi came in for a Share, And little Tom Essences, Author was there. Nor cou'd Durfey forbeare for the Lawrell to stickle, Protesting he had had, the honour to tickle, The Eares of the Town, with his Deare Madam Fickle. With other pretenders, whose Names I'd rehearse, But that they're too long, to stand in my Verse. Apollo, quite tyr'd with their tedious Harrangue, Finds at last, Tom Bettertons, face in the gang, And since Poets, without the kind Players, may hang; By his owne sacred Light, he solemnly swore, That in search of a Lawreat, he'd looke out noe more. A generall Murmur, ran quite through the Hall, To thinke that the Bays to an Actor shou'd fall: But Apollo, to quiet, and pacifye all, E'en told 'em to put his desert to the Test, That he had made Plays as well as the best; And was the greatest wonder the Age, ever bore, For of all the Play-Scriblers, that e're writ before, His Witt had most worth, and most Modesty in't, For he had writ Plays yet ne're came in Print.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX II In defence of Satyr. [by Sir Carr Scroope] When Shakes. Johns. Fletcher, rul'd the Stage, They took so bold a freedom with the Age, That there was scarce a Knave, or Fool, in Town, Of any note, but had his Picture shown: And (without doubt) though some it may offend, Nothing helps more than Satyr, to amend Ill Manners, or is trulier Virtues Friend. Princes, may Laws ordain, Priests gravely Preach, But Poets, most successfully will teach. For as a passing Bell, frights from his Meat, The greedy Sick man, that too much wou'd Eat; So when a Vice, ridiculous is made, Our Neighbors shame, keeps us from growing Bad. But wholsome Remedies, few Palates please, Men rather love, what flatters their Disease; Pimps, Parasites, Buffoones, and all the Crew, That under Friendships name, weak Man undoe; Find their false Service, kindlier understood, Than such as tell bold Truths to do us good. Look where you will, and you shall hardly find, A Man, without some Sickness of the Mind. In vain we Wise wou'd seem, while ev'ry Lust, Whisks us about, as Whirlwinds do the Dust. Here for some needless Gain, [a] Wretch is hurl'd, From Pole, to Pole, and Slav'd about the World; While the reward of all his Pains, and Care, Ends in that despicable Thing, his Heir. There a vain Fop, Mortgages all his Land, To buy that gawdy Play-thing, a Command, To ride a Cock-Horse, wear a Scarfe, at's Arse, And play the Pudding, in a May-day Farce. Here one whom God to make a Fool, thought fit, In spight of Providence, will be a Wit. But wanting Strength, t'uphold his ill made choice, Sets up with Lewdness, Blasphemy, and Noise. There at his Mistress Feet, a Lover lyes And for tawdrey, painted Baby dyes. Falls on his Knees, adores, and is afraid, Of the vain Idol, he himself has made. These, and a Thousand Fools unmention'd here, Hate Poets all, because they Poets fear. Take heed (they cry) younder Mad Dog will bite, He cares not whom he falls on in his fit; Come but in's way, and strait a new Lampoone Shall spread your mangled Fame about the Town. But why am I this Bug bear to ye all? My Pen is dipt in no such bitter Gall. He that can rail at one he calls his Friend, Or hear him absent wrong'd, and not defend; Who for the sake of some ill natur'd Jeast, Tells what he shou'd conceal, Invents the rest; To fatal Mid-night quarrels, can betray, His brave Companion, and then run away; Leaving him to be murder'd in the Street, Then put it off, with some Buffoone Conceit; This, this is he, you shou'd beware of all, Yet him a pleasant, witty Man, you call To whet your dull Debauches up, and down, You seek him as top Fidler of the Town. But if I laugh when the Court Coxcombs show, To See that Booby Sotus dance Provoe, Or chatt'ring Porus, from the Side Box grin, Trickt like a Ladys Monkey new made clean. To me the name of Railer, strait you give, Call me a Man, that knows not how to live. But Wenches to their Keepers, true shall turn. Stale Maids of Honour, proffer'd Husbands scorn, Great States-Men, flatt'ry, and Clinches hate, And long in Office dye without Estate. Against a Bribe, Court Judges, shall decide, The City Knav'ry want, the Clergy Pride. E're that black Malice, in my Rhymes you find, That wrongs a Worthy Man, or hurts a Friend. But then perhaps you'll say, why do you write? What you think harmless Mirth, the World thinks Spight. Why shou'd your Fingers itch to have a lash, At Simius, the Buffoon, or Cully Bash? What is't to you, if Alidores fine Whore, Fucks with some Fop, whilst he's shut out of Door? Consider pray, that dang'rous Weapon Wit, Frightens a Million, when a few you hit. Whip but a Curr, as you ride through a Town, And strait his Fellow Currs the Quarrel own. Each Knave, or Fool, that's conscious of a Crime, Tho he scapes now, looks for't another time. Sir, I confess all you have said is true, But who has not some Folly to pursue? Milo turn'd Quixot, fancy'd Battails, Fights, When the Fifth Bottle, had encreas'd the Lights. War-like Dirt Pyes, our Heroe Paris forms, Which desp'rate Bessus, without Armour storms. Cornus, the kindest Husband, e're was born, Still Courts the Spark, that does his Brows adorn. Invites him home to dine, and fills his Veins, With the hot Blood, which his dear Doxy drains. Grandio thinks himself a Beau-Garcon, Goggles his Eyes, writes Letters up and down; And with his sawcy Love, plagues all the Town. While pleas'd to have his Vanity thus fed, He's caught with G[osnell], that Old Hag a Bed. But shou'd I all the crying Follies tell, That rouse the sleeping Satyr from his Cell, I to my Reader, shou'd as tedious prove, As that Old Spark, Albanus making love: Or florid Roscius, when with some smooth flam, He gravely to the publick, tries to sham. Hold then my Muse, 'tis time to make an end, Least taxing others, thou thy self offend. The World's a Wood, in which all loose their way, Though by a diff'rent Path, each goes Astray.</field>
