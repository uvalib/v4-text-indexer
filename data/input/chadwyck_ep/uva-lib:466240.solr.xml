      <field name="fulltext">VOL.I BOOK I. TALES FROM HERODOTUS. ??? ????? ?? ?? ????? ????????.? Athenæus. B. xxiii. PRELUDE. With fancies that, like phantoms, bear The bodies of long-buried men, Whose bones are dust, whose spirits are air, Whose dwellings are the days that were,— The suns that will not rise again,— A bark, dream-built to drift along The tides of other times, I throng; And, helmless, here and there am blown Beyond my will, by the Power of Song, From shore to shore of regions lone In sempiternal Even lying Glimmeringly, girt by the moan Of memories ever dying. Like that bewilder'd Cretan crew These old-world-wandering fancies are; Whose course, unsteer'd by chart or star, With tugging sail and slanted deck, Latona's newborn offspring blew Where er he will'd; nor could they check In the plunging prow the spirit that knew Whose sudden hand his speed obey'd; As ever about in the billowy dip And briny dance of the beakèd ship A golden dolphin flasht and play'd, While fast thro' shallow foam they flew Along the shore-lock'd seas, and fast Beheld the Elean port slide past, And many a wisht-for haven fade, And many a slowly-sun-flush't bay, Till faint their staggering keel was stay'd Off Crissa; when the crimson day In lights and ardours manifold Was burning all the west away, And, bright beyond the harbour bar, Brimm'd his blue baths with fervid gold: Then, o'er the seaborn mountains far, And far in Even's inmost hold, The weary mariners (thus they say) Saw white walls hang in a rosy air; For so the god had built them there. I.OPIS AND ARGE. In the two succeeding poems the narrative of Herodotus has been literally followed: but in the present instance his passing allusion to the supposed introduction into Greece of the images of the gods, wrapped up in wheaten straw, by two Hyperborean virgins, has been taken only as a text for the utterance of some thoughts concerning what is owed, on behalf of human culture, to the mythology and art of the Greeks. (Herodotus iv. 35.) Past Ophïusa sailing, long ere morn Had stolen beneath the summer stars from where About the waters' verge in paler air The stars are fewest and most large, near land The Ortygian mariners their sea-drench'd bark Moor'd on the shallow sea, a weary band, By Delos, waiting for the dawn; and there, (While broken winds, among the mountains born, Scarce heaved—the sighing stillness of the dark) They heard, along wild shores of capes forlorn, The Hyperborean virgins, hand in hand, Sing loud, from lands beyond the wind o' the north, With mystic music moving down the seas Toward Greece, this hymn, whose latest notes drew forth Full-crownèd sunrise from the Cyclades: “Sister Arge, sister Arge, shake thy tresses to the wind, Till the life that floods them overfloat the lone air with delight! And tread swiftly down the shadows of the starry hills that bind To the bases of the darkness the high silence of the night. Virgin, watcher of the veilèd forms, to whom hath been consign'd The divinity enshrin'd, Thou that bearest on thy bosom all the beauty, all the might, Of the yet-unheard, the yet-unseen, whence floweth sound and sight; Dost thou tremble at the nearness of the time that we are touching? Doth the whitefire leaping in the stars that lead us scorch thee blind? Art thou wary of the sly and wishful winds that would be clutching At the shut heart of the blessing we are bearing to mankind? Show not! show not! Let men know not What is coming. For the mind Of the world is undefined; And the dark not yet the daystar doth release. Wherefore watch ye well, and ward, Sister, hold ye fast, and guard The sacred straw From bruise or flaw, And the mystic veil from soil or crease, Whilst, unseen but aware And awake, we bear The high gods safe to their home in Greece.” “Sister Opis, sister Opis, I am moving at thy side In the power that is upon us: I am treading stride for stride Down the wonder of the world with thee, undaunted by the throng Of the startling stars that, brighten'd by the breath of thy clear song, Give in glory heaven's gladness forth. But oh, the way is long From the distance of the darkness to the distance of the light! And, like a shipman eyeing Along a shoreless sea That sliding rippled lane the lucid moon hath paven bright, Which to sunder, and escape from, all the livelong labouring night His patient keel is trying; But, with a fond denying, It doth ever seem to be Where it first was on the waters, and yet, o'er the waters ever Gliding silent with the ship is still beside it, so that never Is that watcher any further from the light that leaveth dark The last wave it leapeth out of ere 'tis broken by his bark; So my spirit, striving forward, yet doth never find release From the still-pursuing splendour of the thoughts that pass in peace, Passing swift from sweet to sweeter, Strange to stranger, thro' completer Indications of the stature Of the beautiful in nature, To the perfect form and feature Of the godship of this Greece. “I heard a gryphon yelping for his gold across a dim Blue frostbitten mountain gully, where the rock-stream would not flow: I outsped the Arimaspian that was outspeeding him, Whose one eye, when he beheld me, shrivell'd blinded in his brow With a knowledge premature Of what, knowing, to endure, Not yet the gods had granted his incompetence-to-know. And not even so much sound As doth lisp around, around, In a little whisperous whirl of windy snow, My flitting footstep made, As it travers'd unbetray'd The silent iron-colour'd floors of frozen lakes below Those bitter pale Cimmerian skies, Whose ghostly suns with bloodred eyes, Thick wrapt in frosty film, make wan The whited desert of lean plains, Where hornless beeves in wooden wains The Scythian and the Sindian Drive, streaking, as unheard they go, The echoless white waste with slow Dark dotted trains, As silent as, thro' light that lies Lone on the verge of evening, flies A troop of long-neck'd cranes. And the bald-head Argipæan, Beneath his black bean-tree, Sat bare-headed in the sun to judge the people, as I pass'd. But to-night from bowers Eubæan Blow sweet odours up the sea, And the Grecian beauty breathes into my being at the last. Yet I show not, For I know not, What is coming to mankind. White the wheat lies on the faces of the folded Images: And other hands In other lands Are destined to unbind The veil of this Invisible by slowly-sweet degrees. Wherefore aye in watch and ward, Sister, hold I fast and guard The sacred straw From bruise or flaw, And the mystic veil from soil or crease, Whilst, awake and aware, Together we bear The high gods safe to their home in Greece.” A wind, that all night long in Rhodope, Waiting release, had crouch'd with casual thrills Of power but half repress'd, now leaping free, His kindred from the high Keraunian hills Call'd to him athwart the dark Ægæan sea, And swept from Athos and the rocky fringe Of many a mountain-builded promontory Beyond Pallene those high vapours hoary That, soon as Morn swings out on silent hinge Her golden gates against the eastern skies, Do travel the dim air in search of glory. Whereat they rose (greybearded companies, Whose paths above the peakèd mountains are) Leaving the moonless night upon the wane, In haste to fill their floating urns with flame, And midway meet the Light that loves to rise On Delos, where his mother dwelt. There came A change across the skies, and in the strain Of that strange music, that now dropp'd from far Fresh, clear, and cold, as drops of driven rain Dasht on dark summits from the morning star:— “Art thou near me, Sister Arge?” “Sister Opis, I am near.” “And dost hear me, Sister Arge?” “Sister Opis, speak, I hear.” “From the cold to the warm, from the dark to the light, From the wish to the will, from the part to the whole, To the deed from the need, to the day from the night, From the brute in the body to the god in the soul, Man grows. For, the gods having first morsell'd Man into men, Men by growing together must grow into Man; Who grows outward at first, to grow inward again, Thus outgrowing the point whence his first growth began; Till (who knows?) Point by point in successive ascensions, perchance The high gods, on his being upborne, shall go higher Up in Heaven, to leave scope for the search of his glance, And large space for the love in his life to aspire To the air that feeds fire: Still, as more and more godlike he grows, to discover More and more in the godhead, above him for ever; The wider he reaches, more reachlessness; over His highest attain'd, still a higher to endeavour In the Ever-near Never.” Light rose in response mild a lovelier voice Along the morning air, like a spring wind Whose benediction bids old earth rejoice Because of violets it is come to find. “Sister Opis, I hear thee, And, near thee, My heart, with thy song in it, glows; And the fulness of sweetness o'erflows, While thy soul from thy lip All a-tremble doth slip As a dewdrop in light from a rose.” And, higher thought in higher tone to pour, The music of that mystic voice intense Rose on the tingling dark, and more and more Was felt like light within the listener's sense. “Blind and mute no more, As, for ages and ages old, Upon Time's storm-beaten shore It dwelt in the dark and cold Of error, and shame, and wrong, Man's race, erewhile forlorn, With speech that is now made song, And sight that is beauty born, Shall see, and speak, and be heard; And the lion, and wolf, and leopard, As tame as a mountain herd That follows at morn the shepherd, By a music and a light To a fairer land afar, Charm'd out of the caves of night, Shall follow man's dawning star; Where the force, refined to grace, Of Strength and Beauty mated Shall give birth to a lovelier race Of men to gods related; Till there beat in the old brute world A human heart that knows Where the Spirit of Love lies curl'd In all that breathes and blows; And a peeping face shall flit Thro' the leaves of the forest lone, And the mountain wells be lit By the limbs of a Naiad known, And the orbs that brighten heaven Shall be no nameless glory, But the beauty and splendour given To a breathing human story.” Anon together, like two butterflies Born of one flower that gave to both its hue, Which sport around each other in warm skies, Yet all the while their upward flight pursue Thro' summer's liquid lights and melodies, Those voices twain on intertwinèd wing Of woven music mounted, hovering: “Blessèd art thou, O man, at thy lowest, O thou lord of the hand and the thought! For thou livest in that which thou doest, And thou makest thyself out of nought. Now to thy cradle we bear thee The Teachers, the bright, the benign, That out of earth's dust shall uprear thee An altar, a temple, a shrine, And forth of all things that be near thee (By the touch of a tenderness fine) To guide, to sustain, and to cheer thee, Shall summon a Presence Divine. Beauty, the wave-born, the flowing, Shall rise, and in rapture give birth To Love, the man-maker, the glowing Boy-bringer of Beauty to earth. Lo! I weigh thee the weight of thy worth. All things are thine: All things combine In a strenuous design To make thee divine. Name them, and claim them! None dare decline In aught to fulfil The behest of thy will. Choose them, and use them! The moving, and the still, The upright, the supine, Take them, and make them (Both the colour and the line) Ministers all at the marvellous shrine Of the strong-bodied, spirit-wedded, Hundred-handed, myriad-headed, Mighty, wonder-working Skill! “The wave shall render thee Its intricate harmony Of movement multiform, and gliding swerve Of shadowy curve; The mould of Music visible, the free Lip o' the eloquent sea: The vine shall fix for ever For thee her fond endeavour Of drooping leaf, and tendril-twine, To richly deck the rigid line Of limitary law, that lies Unseen, endear'd by love's disguise: The milk-white marble pale, To tell thine eyes the tale Of what thy thoughts discern Beyond them, shall avail Olympian speech to learn; And, for thy sake, forthwith forego The formless face of his smooth snow For novel features, sweet or stern, To fit thy fancy, gay or grave, And in unmoved memorial save The falling leaf, the flowing wave, From death, that doth their beauty crave: And, as both stock and stone To thee their uses lend, Thou too, in turn, shalt these befriend With better beauty, not their own; And every tender slope and turn Of sumptuous form, well-featured face, Or pure proportion, pleased to deck This mortal mould, shall flow to grace Some calyx'd vase, with curling neck, Fine-ear'd, or fluted urn. “Now, therefore, new-grown, Come forth, and be known, Thou poor hewer, thou blind-handed breaker Of wood and of stone! Henceforth, in thy might, as the maker, To the ages be shown! And the gold shall break out into glory, And the ivory be pallid with awe, At the frown of the god high and hoary, That liveth alone in the law Of himself; when, in splendour strong-zoned, Zeus, sovran in Elis, sits throned. “Blessèd art thou, O man! for thou growest (O thou lord of the thought and the band!) In the growth of whatever thou doest, And the ages await thy command. “Life's image, born of the brain, In the form which the hand hath fashion'd, Shall for ever unmarr'd retain Life's moment the most impassion'd; All power, that in act hath been Put forth, shall perish never; And life's beauty once felt and seen Is life beautified for ever.” In that high tone the mingled music shrill Of those triumphant voices, ceasing, left The silence tremulous with a solemn thrill, As one whose troubled sense is sharply cleft By sudden knowledge of undream'd-of good. And, for a while, there was no other sound Than the sea's murmur on the solitude, And the light winds that sigh'd and whisper'd round The dawning headlands. Then, with alter'd tone, Was pour'd from the pale hills one voice alone: “Sister Opis, sister Opis, thou exultest in thy song; For to thee the god speaks certainly, and therefore thou art strong. But me a sorrow moveth in the midst of much delight, For the grief that's growing in the joy, the weakness in the might, Of this two-fold nature, each way growing into depth and height; Whereby more strength more strongly feels more weakness, in despite Of more strength yet in sight. For man, from the moment when man Feels a power in his soul to conceive Of a power surpassing the span Of the life he hath power to achieve, Must be wretched; perceiving, both ways, The abyss of a boundless Beyond; With, as more imperfection may gaze On perfection, more cause to despond. Evermore must the life of the many, That in Art is completed alone, Transcending the mere life of any One creature, leave hopeless that one. And no shepherd shall stand on the mountain As stately as Phœbus the fair; And no maiden shall move by the fountain As radiant as Hebe the rare; And Niobe's marble bereavement, In anguish made beauty forever, Shall immortally mock the achievement Of grief's merely mortal endeavour. Then say, if thou seest,—for I see not, What hope is in man that he be not The architect merely—as, stone Upon stone, it ascends—of his own Mortal life's monumental despair? From insolent heights never ending, In immutable forms ever fair, Conception transcending, offending, And mocking Experience,—declare What shall comfort the poor life of each, When, fixt far beyond the soul's reach, Though confronting the sense—ever there In completion, abasht, it must gaze On the full-imaged life of the All? What shall reconcile shame? and upraise To man's greatness mere men, that are small? Ay me! for man's sake my tears fall, Not seeing whence comfort to call.” Whereto, in answer, the hill-tops along, That other voice, clear, confident, and strong: “Sister Arge, sister Arge, dost thou falter? But to me The god hath given certainly to utter what shall be. Wherefore listen.” “I am listening, with my spirit turn'd to thee.” “List, and see!— Base wert thou, O man, tho' thou buildest Halls higher than ever the emmet, And poor, tho' thou purplest and gildest Thy pomp: a fly's wing would condemn it. But to measure thy weakness, and know it, Is the crown of thy strength. Wherefore speak, And come forth, O consoler! O poet! Thou whose song giveth strength to the weak. Thou doer, aye unguess'd among Things done: deceiver of the throng That's ignorantly thine; whose life, Living thro' all, unheard proceeds Amid the noise of mortal deeds, And shapes of passing things, and strife Of changing times, which, when thy presence Their emptiness and little strength Hath fill'd and interpenetrated With its own divinest essence, Grow great and calm, take breadth and length, And height and depth, and rest related To those immortal verities That change not with the changing skies, And reel not with the rolling years: Thou Destiny, whose thoughts are seers, Come forth, controller of the shears, The spindle, and the rock! Hero, whose words are victories all, Enlarge man's life: leave nothing small, Inconsequent or fractional: The world's shut heart unlock. Do thou with beauty stop the chinks And flaws of uncompleted man, And with music brim the brinks Of nature: filling out the plan Of the life man yearns to live, And strives to seize, but never can, Till thy help to him thou give; Putting space within his span. “Life's flower hath many springs: Leaves fallen feed its root: Camps, nations, courts, and kings Murmur, and soon are mute. But over the bloody plain Where a nation's life lies lost, From the bodies of many slain Doth arise but a single ghost. Nor chance nor change can mar The beauty of her pale brows, Whereon the pilot star Of the wandering Future glows: She, that is all pure essence, Can no more suffer wrong: Men call her name The Presence Of the Past made theirs in Song. And this most beauteous child Of a Past that cannot die, Whose spirit doth reign strong-will'd O'er the realm of Futurity, By means of her mighty sons, that are The makers of man's thought, fair, and far From the perishing Present's fitful strife, Upbuildeth the beautiful dome of life; All throng'd with lucid shapes that be Clothed each in the calm of eternity; Those mighty memories of mankind, Whose home is the universal mind. Wherefore yet I praise man at his lowest, Being lord of the living voice. Hark, O wind, thro' the reeds where thou blowest, Pan cometh! I bid thee rejoice. The ægipans, satyrs, and fauns, To his shrill pipe trooping after, Trample over the lanes and the lawns, With timbrel and tipsy laughter: But after Pan cometh Apollo, Whose music is sound made fire, And the gods and the heroes follow The loud twang of his golden lyre.” Down swept a rushing sound, across the lone And melancholy mountains clothed in cloud, As of the multitudinous hurrying on Of unseen feet, and murmurings of a crowd, With music, cymbals faint, faint flutes; as when On festal days, with pomp processional, And minstrelsy, and dancing maids and men, Some merrymaking city pours thro' all Her gaping gates a jubilant swarm; whose sound Among the humming hills is sometimes heard Where gorges open, and then shut again, Sudden, i' the shifting vale, with all its train Of mirthful tumult manifold, and drown'd In such deep silence that the hooting bird, That haunts by mountain tarns, is audible Far off once more, and audible alone, In the reinstated stillness, with stern tone Chiding the solitary air. So fell Down vaporous precipices, soon almost As heard, those sounds of things unwitness'd, lost Along the dreaming gulfs, and roll'd away. Anon once more, against the dawning day, The former voices; shrill distinct, as darts That, clash'd against sonorous metal, sing, Sharp tune; whereto clear echoes from the hearts Of hollow caves rang response, vibrating: “Sister Opis, sister Opis, on a silver wave of song Sweetly streaming, Dim as dreaming, The deep melodies among, By thy singing, Bliss is bringing All my being. Yet prolong The loved rapture!” “Listen, Sister! For my spirit on the throng Of the ages rushes strong. When the strong archetypal moulders Of mortal clay Have bequeath'd to unborn beholders The forms that stay Fixt and fast In the flux of time, For man's thought, cast In a mould sublime; And the few fine Spirits first needed To build up the walls of the world, (From the Protoplast freshly proceeded) Having, each from his fortress, unfurl'd The standard of man's realm, made fuller For all men by one man alone,— Over marble, or music, or colour, Or language,—are gather'd and gone From the sun's sight, like stars of the morning, Lost in level enlargements of light, Where the world needs no longer their warning Or witness to steer through the night, Then the men that come after, not equal In height, but more spacious in span, Shall combine and complete in the sequel Each sublime isolation: and man, Grown compacter, shall gather together His faculties, full-grown before Each up to the length of its tether, But scatter'd and single of yore. No piling on Ossa of Pelion, Leaving valleys uncultured and lone: But the whole world in high perihelion, Breathing light, shall set broad to the sun! And for this I praise man, at his lowest, Being heir to heights higher than his; For, when even his march is at slowest, He is ever beyond what he is. “The form of the shining present, By the shade of the past controll'd, As the curve of the young moon's crescent Is shapen about the old, In the self-completing orb Of a life, that in its own light Doth the shade of itself absorb, Man lifteth thro' time's lone night. In the present his future he feeleth, Formeth and holdeth it fast, And himself to himself revealeth Himself by himself surpast. “But see! the great light is beginning Up yonder; with sharp silver thinning The thick night, and peeling away The black shell that shut down the day. Leave we here on the high promontory, That is toucht at the tops with the glory, Each great Form, folded fast head and feet, And swathed in the sweet yellow wheat; Best befitting for symbol and sign: For man's first need is merely to live, His next to make mere life divine; Aud the corn-crownèd Ceres must give The first gift to the god-crownèd shrine. With the hard hand that hacks out the harvest From the solid resistance of things, Poor peasant, a portion thou carvest Of ease for thy sons that be kings!” By this, severe cold amber-colour'd light Was sharpening the dark edges of the sea: From shadowy summits, slowly stolen in sight, Thro' the still air the voice came, carolling free: “Come, Sister, come down The deep meadows unmown! Down, Sister, deeper and deeper down, Thro' the lone bright lands Not ours, where hands Happy and fair, in the years unshown, Of boy and of maiden, Shall our sepulchres crown, Flower-deck'd and gift-laden, With green myrtle coronals oft. Light let us stray Down the valleys away, And where shadows wave soft Thro' dim olive-woods, sighing With the low undertone Of a life ever dying, Ere her crownet of dew the pale cistus hath doff'd. Leave the High Ones alone And aloft, fitly lying In the light that lives lonely aloft. Down! down!” Whereto, with mimic echo, from a cloud Brightening upon the impenetrable peak That his dim head in heaven did highest shroud, An answering voice far off came faint and weak: “Down, down, And deeper, Sister, and deeper down, I come, I come To our long-sought home! And, lightly stepping, my step unknown, Not a print, as we pass, ever presses From the blossoming grasses below. We, the breath of the morn in our tresses, And the beam of the morn on our brow! Nevermore to the fierce wildernesses, And the hollow rocks heavy with snow, Nevermore to the storm-beaten beaches, Whose black gulfs their chafed surges churn Into bleak foam, the bitter wind bleaches, Shall our god-guided footsteps return! But here, at the last, our life reaches The limit, and drops in the urn, And passes complete, At the touch of a hand Whose touching is sweet, To a sweeter land.” The louder voice then, with a sudden cry, Peal'd from the lower heights imperatively: “Wherefore stir not a straw From the sacred Awe, And the mystic Veil neither crush nor crease, But, awake and aware, Hid in Delos, there Leave the High Gods o'erlooking their home, sweet Greece!” Whereat both voices, fainter grown, did seem Strange as the ebbing music of a dream: “Hush, O hush, within the sense Of their own wise reticence, Thoughts too sweet for song to sing Even where none be listening! Breathe, O breathe, no sound less light Than a lizard's startled flight Thro' the leaves, when lovers pass O'er the silent summer grass! Leave the dreaming world to waken, Wistful of the mystic numbers Of the music that hath shaken With prophetic sound its slumbers. Let the patient Many fashion Into common use the true Substance of the solemn passion Of the sudden-minded Few. Stay not, singer! song will stay Where who sung it sings no more. Doubt not, doer! love will pay Life's deed done when life is o'er. Haste! away, before the day Show by shadows where we stray! Violets that are not bow'd By the shadow of a cloud Laden with midsummer thunder; Eyes down-lidded in dim sleep, 'Neath whose fringes dare not peep Any dream that passeth under; Be, O earth, more still than those, Where our unseen footstep goes!” And, like a flock of swallows on swift wing, Before the falling of the rain in Spring, Light-wavering o'er a whisperous lowland green; That suddenly, from none knows whence, are seen, And in and out the maze of their own making Inextricably wheel, and wink, and find And lose themselves, but at the last, forsaking Their momentary haunt, do leave behind In the grey light upon the grass beneath Not any shadow; so the scatter'd breath Of those melodious voices, here and there Along the desultory morning air Dispersing, left at last within the wind Not even a wandering echo, as it ceased Against the startling stillness of the east; Where now conspicuous, by no cloud confined, But stern, in steadfast skies, with serious light, Lay bare the starless forehead of the Dawn. The sparkle of a golden sandal shined One moment on the mountain peak. A white And vaporous hem of eddying vesture, drawn Across a saffron-colour'd cliff from sight Slowly, left all along the mountain lawn, Among the tawny grass and camomile, A tremulous streak, soon quench'd in day's strong smile, Of waning splendour. Then those mariners all Rose up amazed, and drew out of the deep The hookèd anchor, and drove out to sea Their little bark beneath a shadowy shore. But, while they set the sail, and plied the oar, Full-lighted on the heavenly mountain wall Leap'd the large Sunrise, and all round shook free His flamy wings: when lo! on every steep, Wrapt with the auroral vapour rolling high, An august image stood, majestical, With lifted arm, far off, 'twixt earth and sky. II.CROESUS AND ADRASTUS. (Herodotus i. 35.) Fortune, that walks above the heads of men I' the rolling clouds, the witless denizen Of airy Nothing, by Necessity Among the unsteady Hours with hooded eye, Subservient to a will not hers, is led: And, as she passes, oft upon his head That, underneath heaven's hollowness, doth stand Highest of men, her loose incertain hand Lets fall the iron wedge and leaden weight. Crœsus, the lord of all the Lydian state, Of men was held the man by Fortune best With her unheedful blind abundance blest: Because all winds into his harbours blew Opulent sails; because his sceptre drew Out of far lands a majesty immense; Because, to enrich his swol'n magnificence, The homage of a hundred hills was roll'd Upon a hundred rivers; because gold And glory made him singular in the smile O' the seldom-smiling world a little while. To him, in secret vision, at the deep Of night, what time Fate walks awake thro' Sleep, The gods reveal'd that, in the coming on Of times to be, Atys, his best-loved son, Untimely, in the unripe putting forth Of his green years, and blossom-promised worth, By an iron dart must perish. Then the king, Long while within himself considering The dreadful import of the dream,—in fear Lest any iron javelin, lance, or spear, Left to the clutch of clumsy Chance, should fall On Atys,—gave command to gather all Such weapons out of reach of him he loved, Safe in a secret chamber far removed. And,—that the menaced prince no more should take His wont i' the woods, with baying dogs to break The rough boar's ambush, nor the lion wound, Nor flying stag, with dexterous darts,—he found, And wived to Atys, the most beautiful Of Lydian women: lovelier than the lull Of summer eves in lands where Summer fills With slumbrous light the slopes of snowy hills Flusht by a fleeting sun. So fair was she Whose claspèd arms should gentle gaolers be To Crœsus' chiefest treasure. This being done, The king was comforted about his son. But while the nuptial feast, at 'mid of mirth, O'erflowed with festival the golden girth Of the king's palace,—while, with fold on fold Of full delight, the mellow music roll'd From Lydian harps a heaving heaven of sound In the gorgeous galleries, and garlands crown'd Warm faces in a mist of odours rare,— There came before the king at unaware A stranger from beyond the storm-beat sea: A man pursued by pale Calamity, With hands polluted; on whose countenance Was fix'd the shadow of foregone mischance. His slow steps up the hymeneal hall Struck sounds that sent deep silence on thro' all That swarming revel. Music's broken wing Flutter'd and strove against the check'd harp string: And he that pour'd stood, holding half-way up The two-ear'd pitcher o'er the leaf-twined cup, While the wine wasted: he that served lean'd o'er The savorous fumes of anice-spicèd boar, With trencher tilted: they whose limbs were dropp'd At ease on purple benches, elbow-propp'd, Half rose, and, stooping forward, shock'd awry From jostled brows, sloped one way suddenly, Their slanted crowns, blue-boss'd with violet, Or dropping roses: each with eyes wide-set In unintelligent wonder on the wan And melancholy image of that man. He, moving thro' the amazement that he caused, Approach'd, unbid, the throne of Crœsus; paused, And there, with groans from inmost anguish brought, The hospitable-hearted king besought His hands by the Lydian rite to purify From taint of blood. To whom, when presently He had his asking granted, Crœsus said: “Whence art thou, stranger? and whose blood hast shed, That doth so fiercely clamour at the porch Of Heaven's high halls? What burning wrong doth scorch Sweet rest from out the record of thy days?” To whom that other: “But that Judgment lays Foundations deeper than Oblivion, I would my shadow from beneath the sun Had pass'd for ever; being the most forlorn Of men! A Phrygian I, and royal-born; The son of Gordius, son of Midas; who, Ill-starred! unwittingly my brother slew. For this, my father from his much-loved face, And all the happy dwellings of my race, Me into wide and wandering exile drave: Whence, flying on the salt white-edgèd wave, Cast out from comfort unto stars unknown, My hollow ship, before the north wind blown, Fate to these shores directed; where I stand A friendless man, sea-flung on foreign land. In thus much learn, O king, from whence I came, And what I am. Adrastus is my name.” The monarch smiled upon him, and replied, “Thy friends are ours: thy land to ours allied: If not with kindred, here with kind, thou art. A frowning fate to bear with smiling heart Is highest wisdom. In our court remain. Cease to be sad. Nor tempt the seas again.” So in the Lydian court Adrastus stay'd, Eating the bread of Crœsus: and obey'd The kindly king, well-pleased to roam no more. Now, at that time, a horrible wild boar, By hunger driven from his lair, below The dells dark-leavèd, lit with golden snow, Where Mysian Olympus meets the morn, Made ravage in the land; despoil'd the corn, The tender vine in many a vineyard tore, Each sapling sallow olive wounded sore, And oft, about the little hilly towns And stony hamlets, where high yellow downs Pasture, among cold clouds, the mountain goat That wanders wild from wattled fold remote, His fierce blood-dripping tusk foul mischief wrought. For this, the sorely-injured Mysians sought At many times the ruinous beast to slay; But never yet at any time could they Come nigh him to his hurt. For he, indeed, Slew many of them, and the rest had need Of nimble feet in fearful flight to find Unworthy safety. Thus was ruin join'd To ruin. Therefore, unto Crœsus now They sent an embassage; that he should know The damage done them by this savage thing; Entreating much, moreover, that the king, With certain of the Lydian youths, would send Atys, the prince, to help them make an end. For of all noble youths in Lydian bound Atys the most high-couraged was renown'd, Nor match'd in martial vigour. Crœsus then, When he had heard the message of these men, Made answer to the Mysians: “For our son, Ye shall not have him. Think no more upon That matter. For, indeed, the crescent light That was newborn to gild his nuptial night Is yet the unfinish'd circlet of a moon. And shall a husband leave a wife so soon, Ere the first spousal month be sped, to lie On hill-tops bare, beneath the naked sky, Neglecting wedlock young, and the sweet due Of marriage pillows, Mysians, for you? But since (touching all else) we love you well And fain would see the huge beast horrible, That hath such havoc made of your fair land, Defeated, we will send a chosen band Of our best valours; men that shall not miss What is to do. Be ye content with this.” But, when the Mysians were therewith content, The son of Crœsus, hearing these things, went To Crœsus, and said to him: “In time past, Father, or in the chase, or war, thou wast The first to wish me famous; who dost now To me forbid the javelin and the bow. Wherefore? For yet I deem that thou hast not In me detected any taint or spot Of fear, dishonouring one to honour born. Yet think how all men from henceforth must scorn Thy son, whom, being thy son, they should revere, In him revering thee, when I appear Among them in the agora: I alone Of all men missing honour to be won From this adventure! For what sort of a man To the coarse general (that is quick to scan Faults in superior natures) shall I seem? Or what to my fair wife? How shall she deem Henceforth of him, who in her white arms lay No less than as a god but yesterday? Wherefore, lest I some memorable deed Now miss to do, I pray thy leave to lead The honourable ardours of this chase, True to my noble name and princely place; Or, this denied, vouchsafe, at least, to say For what just cause I must remain away. Since I, in all things, would my heart convince The king must needs be wiser than the prince.” But Crœsus, weeping, answered: “Not, my son, Because in thee aught unbecoming done Displeased me, nor without sad reason just, And strict constraint to do what needs I must (Not what I would, if what I would might be!) Have I thus acted. For there came to me A vision from the gods, upon my bed, In the deep middle of the night, which said That in the days at hand, an iron dart Thee from my love, and from thy life, must part. For this, thy marriage have I hasten'd on: That, with occasion due, thou should'st, my son, Awhile withhold thee from thy wont to seek The haunts of lions, or with dogs to break The rough boar's ambush in the rooty earth, But rest, companion'd, by the pillar'd hearth, To one new-wedded a befitting place: For this, did I forbid thee to the chase: For this . . . O stay, my son, by thy fair wife, And, in prolonging thine, prolong my life!” And his son answer'd: “Wisely, since the dream Came from the all-wise gods, as I must deem, Wisely, dear head, and kindly, hast thou done; Thus, with forethoughted care, to hold thy son Back from the far-seen coming of the wave Of Fate,—if him forethoughted care could save! But I, indeed, as touching this same chase, Can see no cause for fear. In every place Death's footsteps fall. Nor triple-bolted gate, Nor brazen wall, can shut from man his fate. Yet, had the vision prophesied to me That, or by tooth, or tusk, my death should be, I had been well content to stay at home; Leaving the coming hour, at least to come By me not rashly met in middle way. But since 'twas said an iron dart must slay Me, to black death appointed, I might fear An iron dart as well, tho' staying here, As there, in open field, among my friends. For who can lock his life up at all ends From charmèd Chance, that walks invisibly Among us, to elude the dragon eye Of Policy, and the stretch'd hand of Care? Wherefore, I pray thee yet that I may share What honour from this hunt is to be won, Before death find me. Since a man may shun Honour, yet shunning honour all he can, He shuns not Death, which finds out every man.” Then Crœsus, overcome, not satisfied, From under moisten'd eyelids, doubtful, eyed The impatient flushing in the brighten'd cheek Of Atys. And, because his heart was weak From its vague fears to shape foundation fast For judgment, “Since, my son,” he sigh'd at last “My mind, tho' unconvinced, thy words have shaked, Do as thou wilt.” But, like a man new-waked From evil dreams, who longs for any light To break the no-more-tolerable night, Soon as, far off in the purple corridor, The sandal clicking on the marble floor Ceased to be heard, and he was all alone, And knew that Atys to the chase was gone, He started up in a great discontent Of his own thoughts, and for Adrastus sent. To whom the monarch thus his mind express'd: “Adrastus, since, not only as my guest But as my friend, thou hast to me been dear, If aught of natural piety, and the fear Of Zeus, whom I by hospitable rites Have honour'd, honouring thee, thy heart delights To harbour, heed thou well my words. For I, When thou, pursued by pale Calamity, Didst come before me, thee, upbraiding not, Did purify, and, as a man no spot Of blood attainted, to my hearth received, And there with ministering hand relieved. Now, therefore, follow to the chase my son, Nor leave him ever till the chase be done; His guardian be; prevent him in the way, And let no skulking villain lurk to slay The son of him that hath befriended thee. Moreover, for thine own sake, thou shouldst be Of this adventure; so, to signalise A noble name by feats of fair emprise; Since thy forefathers of such feats had praise, And thou art in the vigour of thy days.” Adrastus answer'd “For no cause but this (Since Crœsus' wish unto Adrastus is Sacred as law delivered from above) In this adventure had I sought to move. For 'tis not fit that such a man as I, Under the shadow of adversity, Should with his prosperous compeers resort; And, not desiring this, from martial sport Among the Lydian youths, with spear or bow, I have till now withheld myself. But now Since I am bid by him I must obey, Bound to requite in whatsoe'er I may Kindness received, this chase I will not shun. Thou, therefore, rest assured thy royal son, Dear Paramount, so far as lies in me, His guardian, shall unharm'd return to thee.” Meanwhile, the huntsmen had with leathern thongs The lean hounds leash'd, and all that fair belongs To royal chase appointed, as was fit; With pious rites around the altar, lit To solemn Cybele, at whose great shrines On wooded Ida, mid the windy pines, Or Tmolus, oft the Sardian, to invoke The mighty Mother, bade the black sheep smoke; And Artemis, the silver-crescented, Adoring whom, a white kid's blood was shed, And crowns of scarlet poppies, intermix'd With ditany, among the columns fix'd, Or hung, fresh-gather'd, the high stones upon. And now the Lydian youths (with whom the son Of Crœsus and the Phrygian stranger) blew The brazen bugles, till the drops of dew Danced in the drowsy hollows of the wood; And the unseen things that haunt by fell and flood, Roused by the clanging echoes out of rest, Shouted from misty lands, and, trampling, press'd Thro' glimmering intervals of greenness cold, To hang in flying laughters manifold Upon the march of that blithe company: Great-hearted hunters all, with quiver'd thigh, And spear on shoulder propp'd, in buskins brown Brushing the honey-meal and yellow down From the high-flowering weed, whilst, in their rear, The great drums throbb'd low thunder, and the clear Short-sounding cymbals sung; until they came To large Olympus, where the amber flame Of morn, new-risen, was spreaded broad, and still. There, for the ruinous beast they search'd, until They found him, with the dew upon his flank Couch'd in a hollow cold, beneath the dank Roots of a fallen oak, thick-roofèd, dim. And, having narrowly encircled him, They hurl'd their javelins at him. With the rest That stranger (he that was King Crœsus' guest, The Phrygian, named Adrastus, purified Of murder by the monarch), when he spied The monster, by the dogs' tenacious bite And smart of clinging steel, now madden'd quite, Making towards him,—hurl'd against the boar: Which missing, by mischance he wounded sore Atys; through whose gash'd body, with a groan The quick life rush'd. Thus fates, in vain foreknown, Were suddenly accomplish'd. For those Powers That spin, and snap, the threads of mortal hours, Had will'd that Crœsus nevermore should hear The voice of Atys; unto him more dear Than fondest echo to forlornest hill In lonesome lands, more sweet than sweetest rill, Thro' shadowy mountain meadows murmuring cold, To panting herds: nor evermore behold The face of Atys; unto him more fair Than mellow sunlight and the summer air To sick men waking heal'd. Now, therefore, one, Having beheld the fate of the king's son, Fled back to Sardis, and to Crœsus said What he had seen:—how that a javelin, sped By that ill fated hand, to nothing good Predestined, from the blot of brother's blood By Crœsus purified, yet all in vain, Since still to bloodshed doom'd,—had Atys slain, Fulfilling fates predicted. Crœsus then, Believing that he was of living men Most miserable, who had purified, Himself, the hand by second slaughter dyed In the dear blood of his much-mourn'd-for son (Since by his own deed was he now undone) Uplifted hands to Heaven, and vengeance claim'd Of Zeus, the Expiator; whom he named By double title, to make doubly strong A twofold curse upon a twofold wrong: As God of Hospitality,—since he That was his guest had proved his enemy; As God of Private Friendship,—since the man That slew his son was his son's guardian, To whom himself the sacred charge did give. Therefore he pray'd, “Let not Adrastus live!” But, while he pray'd, a noise of mourning rose Among the flinty courts: and, follow'd close Out of the narrow streets by a dense throng Of people weeping, slowly moved along The Lydian hunters bearing up the bier Of Atys, strewn with branches; in whose rear, Down-headed, as a man that bears the weight Of some enormous and excessive fate, The slayer walk'd. Full slowly had they come, With steps that ever slacken'd nearer home, And heavier evermore their burthen seem'd, As ever longer round their footsteps stream'd The woeful crowd; and evermore they thought Sadlier on him to whom they sadly brought His hope in ruins. When they reach'd the gate The western sky was all on flame. Stretch'd straight Thro' a thick amber haze Adrastus saw, As in a trance of supernatural awe, The high slant street; that lengthen'd on, and on, And up, and up, until it touch'd the sun, And there fell off into a field of flame. He knew that he was bearing his last shame; And all the men and women, swarming dim Along the misty light, were made to him Shadows, and things of air, for all his mind Was pass'd beyond them. So, with heart resign'd To its surpassing sorrow, he bow'd down His head, and follow'd up the column'd town The bier of Atys, without any care Of what might come: because supreme despair Had taken out the substance from the show Of the world's business, and his thoughts were now In a great silence, which no mortal speech, Kind, or unkind, might any longer reach. Meanwhile, with melancholy footsteps slow, Slow footsteps hinder'd by the general woe, Those hunters mount the murmurous marble stair To the king's palace. He himself stood there To meet them; knowing why they came; with eyes Impatiently defiant of surprise. But, when they set their burthen down before The father of him murder'd whom they bore; And, when the inward-moaning monarch flung His body on the branchèd bier,—there hung With murmurings meaningless, and dabbled vest Soak'd in the dear blood sobbing from the breast Of his slain son,—there, dragg'd along the flint His bruisèd knees; and crush'd, beneath the print Of passionate lips, groans choked in kisses close, Pour'd idly on those eyelids meek, and those White lips that aye such cruel coldness kept, For all the hot love on them kist and wept; And when the miserable wife, whom now The sudden hubbub from the courts below Had pierced to, thro' the swiftly-emptied house, Flew forth, and, kneeling o'er her slaughter'd spouse, Beat with wild hands her breast, and tore her hair, And cried out, “Where, you unjust gods, O where, Between the stubborn earth and stolid sky, Was found the fault of my felicity? That such a cruel deed should have been done Under high heaven, beneath the pleasant sun!” Then he, that was the cause of that wide woe, Came forth before the corpse, and, kneeling low, Stretch'd out sad hands to Crœsus; upon whom He call'd, to execute the righteous doom Of death on him, deserving life no more. When, therefore, Crœsus heard this, he forbore To groan against the edge of his own fate; But judged most miserable that man's state Who, evil meaning not, had evil done,— First having slain his brother, then the son Of him that gave him hospitality. So, letting sink a slowly-soften'd eye To settle on Adrastus, who yet knelt Before him, his hard thoughts began to melt, And he was moved in mind to tolerate The greatness of his grief; which, being less great Than his that caused it, stood in check, to make This tolerable, too. Sadly he spake: “To me,” he said, “thou hast requital made, Most miserable man! on thine own head Invoking death. Wherefore, I doom thee not. Nor deem thy hand hath this disastrous lot From the dark urn down-shaken. Rather, he, That unknown god, whoever he may be, That long ago foreshadow'd this worst hour, Hath thus compell'd it to us. Some veil'd Power Walks in our midst, and moves us to strange ends. Our wills are Heaven's, and we what Heaven intends.” Then Crœsus caused to be upheaved foursquare A mount of milk-white marble: and did there In trophied urn the holy ashes heap Of his loved Atys. And, that fame should keep Unperish'd all the prince's early glory, Large tablets wrought he, rough with this sad story. But when the solemn-footed funeral, With martial music, from the marble wall Flow'd off, and fell asunder in far fields; And silenced was the clang of jostling shields, And the sonorous-throated trumpet mute, And mute the shrill-voiced melancholy flute; What time Orion in the west began Over the thin edge of the ocean To set a shining foot, and dark night fell; Then, judging life to be intolerable, The son of Gordius sharply made short end Of long mischance: and, calling death his friend, He, self-condemn'd to darkness, in the gloom And stillness, slew himself upon the tomb. This to Adrastus was the end of tears. But Crœsus mourn'd for Atys many years. III.GYGES AND CANDAULES. (Herodotus i. 8.) I O for the lute whereon Apollo play'd At Love's own marriage! or the ecstatic string That ransom'd thy too-soon-recaptured shade, Renown'd Eurydice, from Hell's hard king! O for one warbled strain of those that made Ulysses long to leave his voyaging, That in my song might now be felt and seen The beauty rare of King Candaules' Queen! II In old Mœonian Lydia, lord of all Between the blue sea-floors and snowy brows Of ancient Tmolus, where, by many a wall Red with the bloom of ripe pomegranate boughs, From bridge to bridge, the Golden Tide did fall Thro' silken Sardis, with his bright-hair'd spouse Dwelt that soft monarch, slave to her sweet eyes, In gardens green 'neath costly canopies. III For he was so enamour'd of his wife, So sunk in love's soft sea without a shore, That he no longer lived save in the life Which her full-flowing loveliness did pour On his dim passion: all his thoughts were rife With her red kisses: ever he forbore State business, and let all things fall asleep That he might dream, and dream, of beauty deep. IV There was no sweetness under the sweet sky That to the heart-sick king was half so sweet As all the languorous summer days to lie, Faint as a fallen rose leaf, at her feet; To loose his spirit o'er her in a sigh; And feel, like sunny light and odorous heat, The bounteous influence of her looks and lips, And touchings fine of her faint finger-tips. V And he would break from solemn council hall, To breathe within the comfort of her face; And he would steal from flaring festival, To sit within her smile in private place; And oft in midst of grave discourse would fall To musing mute upon her matchless grace, Then hurl wild words of passion into air, Vaunting her perfect limbs and lustrous hair. VI But oftenest he with Gyges would discuss Her unimaginable excellence; —Gyges, his friend, the son of Dascylus, A man in honour, and of soberest sense To disapprove the over-garrulous Ill-counsell'd king; whom he, with deference, Rebuked not seldom, pacing pleasant hours Among the palace halls and garden bowers. VII Yet this Candaules, in his foolishness, (Mad as a man foredoom'd to misery!) Was anger'd that his friend should aye repress, With slant cold speech, his fervid ecstacy. And once he said “But you would wonder less, Since man's ear is less credulous than his eye, That I so boast the beauty of my Queen, If you her unrobed whiteness once had seen.” VIII But Gyges cried “Forbid it, gods on high, That I should see a sight to shame my king! For woman's robe is woman's modesty. Surely, a man should only heed the thing Which only him concerns. And therefore I, That would my Queen to no dishonour bring, This wisdom from the words of sages spell: ‘Let no man wish what is to no man well.’” IX This Gyges answer'd; and for evermore, Fearing lest harm unto himself should be, The foolish king with cautious words forbore; But evermore the foolish king, for he Was às a man the Nymphs have frenzied, swore That his too-much-mistrusting friend should see The thing he would not. Therefore he replied “Have thou no fear lest mischief hence betide. X “Her shalt thou see, thyself by her unseen; For in the purple draperies of the door, By night, what time the unsuspecting queen Lone, as her wont is when our cups flow o'er, Moves to the nuptial couch, behind the screen Of broider'd Tyrian that is drawn before The inner portal, thou, close-hid, shalt see Her smooth-limb'd beauty breathing bare to thee. XI “Fast by the royal couch for ever stands, Under a silver lamp, a golden chair; And, when she comes, she with her own white hands Lays down her light of gorgeous garments there; And smoothly slips from out their jewell'd bands Her lustrous shoulders; and beams shining fair In the amazèd mirror, ere is slid Her snowy sweetness 'neath the coverlid.” XII Then Gyges, when he found not any way The monarch's mad design to set aside, With groaning heart prepared him to obey, Tho' cursing deep his king's unkingly pride. And, when night came, from out the banquet they With guilty steps, like stealthy ghosts, did glide Thro' wondering chambers dim with woven dyes, And listening lengths of empty galleries. XIII Thus to the nuptial chamber did they steal. And in the portal's purple curtains there The king himself did Gyges close conceal, And bade him watch behind the golden chair Whereby the queen her beauty should reveal. Then to the banquet back, without a care, Went King Candaules, pleased with folly done; And Gyges with his thoughts was left alone. XIV And first self-scorn shut all his sullen sense Within himself: but soon the odours sweet, Stream'd from the misty lamps, and that intense Rich-scented silence, seeming to entreat Some sound to ease its sumptuous somnolence, Lured out his thoughts, and made his pulses beat With wondrous expectation. The dim place Seem'd aching to be filled up by her face. XV Meanwhile, the music out of distant halls Humm'd like the inland sound of hid sea-shores, And ghostly laughters lapsed at intervals Along the faint-lit cold-wall'd corridors; And portals oped and shut, and then footfalls That wander'd near, and, over other floors To other silence, wander'd off again, Kept up continual throbbing in his brain. XVI At length, deep-down the opposing gallery, From out the long-drawn darkness flash'd a light; And, peering from his purple privacy, He spied, with red gold bound and robed in white, Sole as the first star in a sleepy sky, That, while men watch it, grows more large and bright, The slow queen sweeping down the lucid floor; And in her hand a silver lamp she bore. XVII Before her, coming, floated a faint fear Into his heart who watch'd her whiteness move Swan-soft along the lamp-lit marble clear, And, lingering o'er her in the beams above, The wing'd and folded shadow shift and veer, Her airy follower, fraught with fretful love. Thro' all his shaken senses rose vague heat From the sweet sounding of her sandall'd feet. XVIII Anon, she enter'd, and her lamp down-laid By the smooth-metall'd mirror; and awhile Stood, slanting low the glory of her head, And dipp'd her full face in its own warm smile; Then look'd she sidelong thro' one loosen'd braid Of her rich hair, as tho' she would beguile Some love-sick spirit on the air to linger, Twining a gold curl round her glowing finger. XIX But soon she all that twisted gold outshook, Till over either shining shoulder stream'd The sudden splendour; and began to unhook From those white slopes the buckled gems that beam'd Deep in the mirror's kindling dark, which took Her mellow image to itself, and gleam'd With soft surprises, and grew bright and warm With the delicious phantom of her form. XX Her Gyges watch'd, as one that helpless hears The cataract call him downward. His heart made Such passionate pealing in his flutter'd ears, That by his fear he fear'd to be betray'd. And, but that ever greater with his fears His raptures grew, he had not so long stay'd; But, having stay'd so long, he still must stay, And, having look'd, he may not look away. XXI Last, she with listless long-delaying hand The golden sandals loosed from her white feet, And loosed from her warm waist the golden band. The milk-white tunic slided off its sweet Snow-surfaced slope, and left half bare her bland Full-orbèd breast. But, in the fainting heat Of his bewilder'd heart and fever'd sight, Here Gyges in the curtain groan'd outright. XXII She started, as a Nymph of Dian's train, Surprised, when bathing blithe in forest pool, By some chance-straggler from the purple plain, Ere she, quick-flashing thro' the fern-fringed cool, Her golden darts can from the green weed gain, Wherewith to pierce the rash low-fronted fool; And where he cower'd, she, in superb surprise, Levell'd the lustres of her angry eyes. XXIII Then, more with wrath than shame, from breast to brow Each snowy surface pass'd to rosy red, The rosy redness pass'd again to snow; Scornful she sprang into the purple bed, And plunged her globed and gleaming limbs below Their silken-fringèd sheath. Forth Gyges fled, As from the god profaned some mad wretch flies, Stricken and scorch'd, beneath indignant skies. XXIV All down the hollow gallery, after him The loud stones shouted at his heels: behind The unseen Fury, sailing fast thro' dim And dreadful space, breathed like a burning wind Upon his hair: swift fire in every limb Seeth'd up and down: night's blackness broke and shined All round with restless eddyings of the glare Of that strong vision, flooding the hot air. XXV Nor did he, chased by stony echoes, mark The silly-smiling king, with tumbled wreath, Stretch hands wine-stain'd to stay him in the dark, And waft wild whispers thick on heated breath To win him back. More desperate than the bark Unrudder'd in the storm, and blind as death, He rush'd to waste himself in some unknown Mad morrow, from that wicked midnight grown. XXVI But when at last clear-crested Dawn upbroke The seeming-endless trouble of that night, And Gyges out of sleepless dream half woke To wonder at himself, and loathe the light, And groan beneath the unaccustom'd yoke Of wrong recall'd, whilst yet on his sick sight Swam floating gleams of all that glory seen, And the wish'd image of the much-wrong'd Queen, XXVII Even then, whilst smouldering fancy strove, like flame Choked under kindled weeds, some rainy night Leaves moist at morn, a sudden summons came From her whose eyes still scorch'd him. Oh what might Of dreadful dearness now was in that name, To mingle sick dismay with mad delight, And, oh, with what shamed knowledge now must he Loathe to be seen by whom he longs to see! XXVIII Unconscious by what power his powerless feet Were moved within the light of her deep eyes, He sank beneath them, smitten by the heat Of their slow scorn; and, pour'd in agonies Upon the pavement, did not dare to meet Looks that grew large and larger, to comprise The slowly-widening circle of some doom That deepen'd ever in their sultry gloom. XXIX Long while she spake not; and thro' every limb He felt the silence straining at his heart; Whilst her remorseless eye, still searching him, Went to its aim like a dividing dart: But still faint nearness to the fragrant rim Of her warm robe dissolved his inmost smart In dear delight, and still in sumptuous dread Swift lives of joy seem'd dying. Then she said: XXX “Rise! and remember that thou wast a man, Tho' most unmanly hast thou shamed in thee Earth's universal manhood. Dare to scan The monstrous measure of thy wrong to me, Then find whatever expiation can Make life not all intolerable. We Are made one shame together. I that bear, And thou that didst, this wrong, this wrong must share.” XXXI But he, that long'd into her arms to leap, And, lost in too-completed life, die there, Swift as a fountain flashes from the deep Up into sudden sunshine and sweet air, Sprang, shivering, to his height; and, from its steep And restless poise 'twixt rapture and despair, His long-pent passion overflow'd, and he His full heart, gushing into speech, set free. XXXII Then, when he flung into fierce words and few Recital of the monarch's mandate base, Wherewith he strove, and strove in vain, there grew Strange anguish in the changes of her face. “Enough it seem'd,” so moan'd she, “when I knew Myself, tho' most unmeriting disgrace, The fool of outrage. Must a husband's name Stay ever at the summit of my shame? XXXIII “Yet, half, my knowledge of the king divined In last midnight's intolerable deed The ignominious madness of his mind. And, but that nature would so sharply plead With that unnatural thought, all human kind (For such wide warrant such wild wrong must need!) Of human kindness had seem'd emptied quite, Since love could in such loathly deed delight. XXXIV “For thou hast seen what, so to have been seen, Leaves an eternal blush between us twain. My blood yet burns where'er thine eyes have been: And insult unavenged in every vein Makes memory mad. Me miserable Queen! Where shall I turn? To whom do I complain?” “Nay but,” said Gyges, “injured Beauty's child, Indignant Love, slew him whose gaze defiled XXXV His mother's image. That wrong-doer lives No more in me, that am Love's votary all!” “Yea, so?” she answer'd. “But the king survives, And this round base of earth is made too small To hold such shameless husbands with shamed wives. The very stones beneath men's heels will call Disgrace on things so graceless, and express Scorn of this king of all unkingliness! XXXVI “But words waste anger weakly. Therefore choose: There is no room beneath the all-circling sun For me, and thee, and him, wherein to lose The knowledge of the thing which hath been done. Wherefore to us nought rests but to refuse To live ourselves, or not let him live on. Judge thou for both. Die, and I follow thee: Or, slaying him, live on sole lord of me.” XXXVII She ceased with a long sigh; and look'd, less scorn Than sad self-pity, and dejection deep, Lowering faint eyelids over eyes forlorn. But Gyges cried “O that the tomb should keep In that oblivious night, which hath no morn To call obstruction cold from senseless sleep, The silenced sweetness of so fair a face, And no breath leave of all its breathing grace! XXXVIII “Or that those lustrous limbs should ever fade To fleeting shadow by the lampless shore Of Orcus, or that lovely form be laid In urnèd ashes to be seen no more! But might the half of this dear debt be paid By hecatombs of lives and seas of gore, And had the king a hundred lives to lose, To reach thee thro' them all I still must choose!” XXXIX She mused a little; and her intricate eyes, Orb within orb, grew dark with cruel light. Then she said slowly “On the place he dies Where he design'd dishonour yesternight. But we must risk no rescue, hear no cries; Sleeping, we slay him swiftly. Briefest fight With fate is safest counsel. That must be This night. The headless kingdom falls to thee, XL “To thee whatever rests of woman here Not made the food of Furies such as rise From deeds like this. And so, from year to year, We two must learn to bear each other's eyes; Nay, cling the closer to shut out pale Fear, And smother Horror up in Love's disguise. For never now for us, ah never more Love's chaste auroras! Dewy dawn is o'er. XLI “This sun of passion, fed with guilty fire, Leaps blood-red from the womb of blackest night. Yet call it lovely names! I must desire Thy love, and love thee, ay in scorn's despite! Since my hate help of thy hate doth require. It were less base to be united quite Than in this shameful nearness to remain, One in dishonour, tho' in honour twain. XLII “So kiss this crime off!” Suddenly she fell, A blinding gush of beauty upon his breast. Thereafter all day long, in surge and swell Of whirling thoughts, he chased his own unrest About wild places, till heaven's purple bell Was dropt with stars, and redden'd round the west; Then in dark precincts, where the palace shone New-lit, he paced the impatient hours alone. XLIII Ere midnight, thro' the dusky doors he slid, Drawn like an evil dream adown the dark; And in the penetralian purples hid His wicked knife, and crouch'd where he might mark The stealthy signal, which his steps should bid To their bad goal; and soon from slumber stark The King's hard breathing on the silence spread, And the Queen beckon'd from the treacherous bed. XLIV There, bent beneath the winking lamp, those two, With hearts hard-edged as was their glittering knife, The senseless King in silken slumber slew, And, with no moan, from his misusèd life He fleeted down to Orcus. Then they drew The dead reluctant weight, thro' silence rife With horror, o'er the soak'd and slippery floor, And dropp'd the blood-red ruin at the door. XLV So died Candaules, slain for deed obscene: So fell the Heracleidæ's fared tree. So Gyges took the kingdom and the Queen: So wrong was heap'd on wrong, till Fate should be Accomplish'd. But, by Heaven's high Justice seen, Not unjudged went the deed. For when, to free The realm from that usurping hand, men rose, And shook the throne, and added woes to woes, XLVI The god at Delphi sentence strict proclaim'd: That crown and queen to Gyges should belong, Since queen and crown the murder'd King had shamed; Albeit, because wrong is not heal'd by wrong, Therefore sharp retribution Fate had framed Far in the folded years, and curses strong To plague the canker'd brood as yet unbred From the base getting of that guilty bed.

      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. THANATOS ATHANATOU. The Latin rhymes with which this poem is interspersed have not been introduced whimsically, but as the simplest means of giving to monastic sentiment a language plainly distinguishable from that of the other utterances amongst which the voice of it is here occasionally audible. “That was enough which long ago, while we were yet at Carthage, Nebridius used to propound, at which all we that heard it were staggered:—‘That said nation of darkness which the Manichees are wont to set as an opposing mass over against Thee, what could it have done unto Thee, hadst Thou refused to fight with it? For if they answered, “It would have done Thee some hurt,” then shouldst Thou be subject to injury and corruption: but if it could do Thee no hurt, there was no reason brought for Thy fighting with it; and fighting in such wise as that a certain portion or member of Thee, or offspring of Thy very Substance, should be mingled with opposed powers and natures not created by Thee, and be by them so far corrupted and changed to the worse, as to be turned from happiness to misery, and need assistance whereby it might be extricated and purified; and that this offspring of Thy Substance was the soul, which, being enthralled, defiled, corrupted, Thy Word, free, pure, and whole, might relieve; that Word Itself being still corruptible, because It was of one and the same Substance. So then, should they affirm Thee, whatsoever Thou art, that is, Thy Substance, whereby Thou art, to be incorruptible, then were all these sayings false and execrable; but, if corruptible, the very statement shewed it to be false and revolting.’”—Confessions of S. Augustine, B. VII. (ii.) 3. “I set now before the sight of my spirit, the whole creation, whatsoever we can see therein (as sea, earth, air, stars, trees, mortal creatures;) yea, and whatever in it we do not see, as the firmament of heaven, all angels moreover, and the spiritual inhabitants thereof.” . . . “And I said, Behold God, and behold what God hath created . . . both Creator and created, all are good. Whence, then, is Evil?” —Idem. (v.) 7. “O Truth who art Eternity! and Love who art Truth! and Eternity who art Love!”—Id. (x.) 16. The Ninth Hour—Darkness over Calvary. VOICES FROM ABOVE.

Wild in the windless dark, what sullen song Rolls this way from the waste? Our wings be wet With dismal dews, bloody and salt. SPIRITS (rising). The strong Grief o' the grey old Earth these drops doth sweat. The moan of old Earth's wrong Mounts: and we mount with it. A VOICE FROM THE EARTH. I have nourish'd my numbers of nations On a hope that hath never been blest: And the ghosts of my gone generations Vex me yet with reproachful unrest. Worn by long unrequited endeavour, As I roll thro' my ages of pain, I have listen'd, I listen for ever, For a word that is waited in vain! AN ECHO. In vain! VOICE FROM THE EARTH. In temple and palace The bread and the chalice, Bitter with brotherless pride, Are eaten and drunken by Murder and Malice Crown'd, mitred, and mantled, and magnified, While brute-born Hunger, in hovel and den, Is smiting and biting the bones of men In whose bodies their souls have died. One Misery goeth in gold: And one Misery goeth acold: And there is no difference beside, However their dust be drest: For the flourishing Evil is sad, Because it is Evil at best: And the fading Good is not glad, Because it is Good opprest: And their wretchedness knoweth no rest From a hope that is ever belied In a blessing not ever possest. The children cry at the birth, Buds cursing a canker'd stem! Shall they live or die? What strength have I, The mother of miseries, Earth, To bear, or to bury them? From pitiless city to city, Passion hath hunted Pity: Love feedeth his funeral pyre On the flame of his own heart's fire: My altars gurgle with groans, Soak'd black are my temple stones With the blood of my whitest ones. Surely, surely O Lord, It is time to utter the word, And deliver Thyself, and Thy sons. AN ECHO. Deliver Thyself and Thy sons! VOICES FROM HUMANITY. Tristis nostra est conditio: Qui parentis, ab initio, Protoplasti vim in vitio, Dum spiramus, propagamus Usque ad finem hominum Nec suplicio nec exitio Nostra subtrahit petitio Multum quidem nos luentes, Ob parentes, heu! solventes Dirum debitum hominum Prima mali labes crescit: Unde hominum marcescit Genus omne. Sicut fumus Fugit dies. Ægri sumus: Cor humanum nihil corrigit: Nemo nobis manum porrigit: Quin et etiam vincit fortis Inexpletoe hasta mortis Dominorum Dominum. VOICES FROM THE GRAVE. Of yesterday's joy and its sorrow, Of the hopes and the fears of to-morrow, Of misery, madness, and mirth, Of the bright and the sable spheres Where the treasures of space are stored, Of the wonderful world they engirth, Azure-roof'd, emerald-floor'd, Of the monuments Memory rears, And Pride, with a gory sword, Graves, forging the name of Worth, Of the scrolls of singers and seers With the words of promise scored, Words written to lull the pain Of Doubt, from Doubt's dictating, We have sought, and sought again, The meaning of Life and of Birth. We have waited—waited in vain, For an answer, a token, a word; Waited—waited for years, Waiting, weeping, and waiting, Till Death, to be rid of our tears, Hid us under this handful of earth, Where still the old hopes, the old fears, Wait in vain for an answer, O Lord. AN ECHO. Answer, O Lord! A VOICE FROM THE SHADOW OF DEATH. Mortui non laudabunt te, Neque in infernum Qui descendunt, Domine! Exibit nam spiritus: Revertetur animus Subter humum. Venit hora: Sistit opus: silent ora: Non auditur vox clamantis: Non respondet cor amantis: Et amores et labores Pereunt in eternum! A VOICE FROM THE SEA. Slave of the Spirit of Might Have I been in my own despite, For ages, and ages; But a memory yet of a ruin'd right To a something lost of divine delight Thro' my mid-inmost rages For ages, for ages! I have struck with a struggling shoulder The sides of this stubborn star, Till old promontories, older Than its oldest memories are, Began to crumble and moulder And drop under my prison bar. I have tumbled my sands and shells Over cities and citadels; Thro' ages and ages, Ever moving, moaning ever; Ever seeking, finding never, Answer to the deep endeavour Of the spirit that in me dwells, Which no rest assuages Thro' ages and ages. With the voice of my waves and storms I have question'd the million forms That float in the molten thunder, And drop with a voice of wonder Down the red-litten Ruin-smitten Hollow and hissing dark, When 'tis suddenly, terribly, torn asunder By the leap of the lightning-spark: My voice the sun's mid noon, My voice the midnight moon, By whose silver sceptre cold With strong moanings manifold Are my wishful waters drawn, Long hath heard; and the white Dawn; And the wistful Even, too; What time round his pavilion Of blue, amber, and vermilion, He, with a stealthy finger That doth ever love to linger, Softly disengages From out their azure cages, To float in fervid heights, All those wingèd lights That soar on winking pinions Of white fire, and wander thro' Their newly-gain'd dominions Of divinest blue; Still lifted up, long ages, Still vainly, to enquire (For man, whose mind makes choice Of mine, to be the voice Of his own pining pain) Wherefore infinite desire Finite power doth enchain? But, unanswer'd by the ages Wherewith man's passion wages Weary war, that doth but tire, Waste, and break him, I again To the sorrow of his sages Fling their question back; in vain Forced upon me; never nigher To the knowledge they would gain Of the meaning of man's pain. AN ECHO. Pain! VOICES FROM THE AIR. Hourly in a crystal cup Do we Spirits gather up The sounds of all the sorrows Of the yesterdays and morrows Of man's measured misery.

The Second Death is yet. The worst Hath evermore a worse beyond. A VOICE FROM THE CROSS. I thirst! VOICES BELOW THE CROSS. Mix the hyssop with the myrrh! DÆMONS OF THE OUTER DEEP. A cup of deadly wine Be it ours to minister To a thirst divine! We are the Cruelties of Nature, That swarm to overwhelm The spirit in the creature That invades her realm. Horror, stolen from the lips Of the livid-faced eclipse; Terror, from the scorch'd earth under The swift transit of the thunder; Wrath from the enormous ocean; Madness from the earthquake's motion: DÆMONS OF THE INNER DEEP. Pallid fears, heart-harrowing cares, From invincible night-mares; And the stealthy day-by-day Of what turns men's hair to grey; And the sudden, sharp collapse Of Courage, when the vast Perhaps Springs at unawares in sight; And the whisper in the night That breaks a noble heart: OF THE OUTER DEEP. Deep awe From the abysses: vulture's claw, Serpent's fang, and scorpion's sting, Tiger's tooth, and dragon's wing: All that's hideous and unholy Mix we here, to make the wine Of our mighty melancholy, Meet for lips divine. TOGETHER. Fleshly pang, and ghostly woe: Let him drain it! Let men know What of God's Divinity Dwells in Man's Humanity! DÆMONS OF THE OUTER DEEP. Weave the web of agony, Softly! softly and silently Wind the web of agony Round about his heart! Delicately let it lie On the spirit and the eye, Mesh'd with finest misery, And in every part Strung, by choicest cruelty, Strong with subtlest smart! Draw the tightening threads together, Stronger each than adamant, Lighter each than powdery feather Fall'n upon the florid plant Where, all faint from fervid ether, To his inmost honied haunt Summer's fond and wanton rover, The fine-wingèd moth doth creep. Let the film of anguish hover O'er his senses, like the sleep Of sick fear that settles over Stifled lands in lurid weather, When, beneath, pent earthquakes gather Forces for a sudden leap! Let him break it, if he can, And reveal the God in Man! DÆMONS OF THE INNER DEEP. Thro' and thro' the strangling weft, Drive the knife home to the heft! Turn it in his inmost heart! Turn it! Let him feel the smart Of the sharpness of the whole Of the iron in the soul! Let him bear it, if he can, And avenge the God in Man! TOGETHER. Probe the wound unto the core! Burn and bite into the bone! Prove we, if this man be more Than the men that went before, And were swiftly overthrown. Let him feel it all he can, Feel as God may feel for Man: Fleshly pang, and ghostly woe! It is fit that men should know What of God's Divinity Dwells in Man's Humanity! THE VOICE OF SATAN ON THE HEIGHTS. Make good thy double title, Son of Man, Or Son of God! If Son of God thou beest More than all other sons of man that be, Then is thy solitary deed, tho' done In man's disguise, not man's: whose life remains No loftier and no lovelier than before His flesh was filch'd to test the transient play Of a god's power which, tho' in him put forth, Leaves man's self helpless as that hollow heap Of trophied harness from whose lifeless clutch Some passionate hero plucks the brand, to prove How living hands may wield it. Son of God If thou beest only but as all men be, Then, more than all men can thou canst not. Named By either title,—son of Man or God,— I do defy thee, by surpassing pangs, To snatch from me my old supremacy In sorrow, my Divinity of Pain. Vainly with me in misery dost thou vie, Prophet of Pity!—whom I pity most, That thou should'st deem it possible to force Far recompense from transient torment spent On what thou addest to a million more And mightier woes,—or, that oblivious Time, Who, as he marches, all behind him burns, Will halt his wasteful course, to count and keep (Once dropt into the measureless abyss Of anguish, and the homelessness of things) The few red drippings of that dolorous brow. Why, how now, O mine Enemy? Behold! There is not one of thy lost children here,— Thy children by lost heritage in Hope, Mine by adoption and the curse of Sin,— There is not one of these that hath not groan'd Beneath some throe as sharp as at this hour Racks the God in thee! Count the ages up By all their aching pulses, and consider What power is thine,—even to contemplate The congregated anguish and despair, Grim ignorance, wrath, execration, fierce Brute wrongs, and purblind drudging wretchedness, The heart-broken memory, the trampled hope, The slow, cold, suffocating creeping care, The cankering doubt, choked longing, livid hate, The stabbing shame, the stark, gaunt, naked need, The weary struggle of the strangled will, The whirling frenzy, and the wild regret, The dim, inexplicable shapeless dread, The intense torture unendurable, The sick self-loathing, and the crusht revolt Of the excruciated flesh—all, all The myriad miseries cramm'd into the curse Not of man only, but of all that lives: Whose several sufferings, separate discontents, And special curses, are summ'd up in man, As man's in me, that of man's miseries all Am the unanswer'd Protest against Him That made us what, for being, we are plagued: From puling infancy to pining youth, From life's mid fever to its last faint gasp, From the worm trodden by the heedless foot To the man broken by the heavy years He staggers under, or else caught and crusht By the strong sudden hand in the first fray, And trampled by his fellows: Fate's blind fool Upon whose borrow'd image he himself Now wreaks the rabid fury of his race Rear'd into endless enmity with all That to upraise it doth in vain aspire. What I endure,—I call, to testify, All creatures, and all things inanimate, Which are as pasture to my pain. Respond From your abysses and sublunar haunts, From viewless dens, or public paths of pain, In earth, or air, or sea,—whatever creeps Or flies, or swims, or with inanimate woe Makes inarticulate protest,—blighted growths, Canker'd, corrupted, curst!—ye prisoners all That populate this penitential star, And know my voice! thou ocean, from thy deeps Where Desolation dwells, thou realm of air Whereof I am the prince,—and all ye winds That waft and mock the moanings of the world,— Thou ancient earth,—and all ye habitants Of this old lodge of anger!—Listen God! AN INORGANIC VOICE. I suffer! ORGANIC VOICES. And we suffer! HUMAN VOICES. And we suffer! SATAN. Enough! Ye suffer for my sake, as He Suffers for yours, and suffering hath no end! Thou Lord of Love, dost thou these voices hear? What are thy pangs to those which these endure, And have endured for ages, and must yet For ages more, moan under? Lord of Love Thou knowest what Love can suffer, and no more! But men were born to hate themselves, and thee: Love is not of their nature. Dost thou deem That any tear thou weepest can blot out The curse that's scrawl'd across a universe Condemn'd from the beginning to the end? Few were thy mortal years, and counted soon: In thine Immortal,—nothing! Short thy strife, Soon quench'd its agony! Yet, if the thirst Of this soul-parching Hour might drain the dregs Of all the tears of all the centuries, Lost were thy labour! For, if man thou art, More than all men have done thou canst not do; But more than all must fail, who more than all Hast dared. If thou beest God, why then, as God, Conquer thou canst: but in that conquest, man, That hath no part, can no more profit claim Than some poor savage, in a barbarous isle Half brutish born, could boast of, did he know That otherwhere, in Athens or in Rome, Some being, like himself, of woman born, Form'd, like himself, of flesh and blood, like him Mortal, hath learn'd the lore of Samian seers, Or won the Cæsar's crown. God's strength is god's: Man's at the best, can be but man's; who fails Tho' God, as God, succeed: and thy success (If thou succeedest) is not man's, but His Whose power, in thee, is but superfluous proof Of a foregone conclusion. Man, or God, If man, hope nothing to man's hope denied, If God, tho' thou God's conquest claim, I claim Man's failure: most in thee: who mock'st him most With what he might be, if, like thee, he had A god's strength in him, by a god's will plied. A VOICE FROM THE CROSS. Wherefore, my God, hast thou forsaken Me? [A pause. INORGANIC VOICES. Is God no longer in Humanity? Then masters of Man's godless world are we, Peopling its pale impersonality. EVIL SPIRITS (gathering). Darknesses, Silences, Strangenesses, waken! Ye, that forsake not whom God hath forsaken, Take the Untaken! THE SILENCES. By the sweetness of music slain Is the soul of our silence fed On a pang surpassing sound. THE DARKNESSES. And our darkness' dearest gain By the ghost of a glory dead With a sharper shade is crown'd. THE DEEDLESS ONES. From the lonesome places, Unseen, untrod, Where no life traces In seed or sod The love that chases The steps of God; THE DEFEATED ONES. From the twilights sunk in the nether dens, Where Madness and Death are denizens; From the wildernesses of wasted dreams, Where pale-faced Failure strays, and feeds Her footless flocks by the frenzied streams Of desires dragg'd down among broken deeds; From the shipless shore where no bird flies, But old wrecks choke the sobbing tide, And the stranded wretch, that beheld our eyes Where the storm-wave cast him, crazed and died; From the red high road to the sudden end, Which the blood of its lone wayfarer streaks, Who, dogg'd by the fear of himself, doth wend Till the suicide findeth the knife he seeks; From the flint-bound cells, where a strong heart breaks When the maniac's chain in his last gasp shakes; Where from milkless nipples unmated mothers Pluck the nameless babes the unblest earth smothers, And the Memories God remembers not In the charnel houses of Hope do rot; TOGETHER. We come! we come! In the frustrate strife Of the vanquisht life, On the course misrun To the goal unwon By the faith, self-cheated Of the deed defeated, To claim our home. DENOUNCING VOICES. Thus far rose the race of man, Thus low doth it lie. Worlds that in man's faith began In man's failure die. EVIL SPIRITS OF THE HEIGHTS (descending). The plain we have left unmolested Where low things low lie, still. The dust in the dust lay, and rested Where the wind had wreak'd on it his will; Tho' the plumes of the purple-crested Thunder throbb'd on the hill. For what can be done, or undone, With the filth that is filth for ever? So we spared our pain To ruin the plain, And, leaving it safe in its baseness alone, Made wing for the higher endeavour. It is but an atom of earth, A grain, a speck most small; But the place of it gave it worth, For this summit was highest of all. So for ages and ages long We Spirits had no such bliss As to watch, with our eyes upon it, Waiting to do it wrong: Since the devil had need of this. And, lo you! at last we have won it. A grain,—no more: but it grew Where all things fall if it fall. A speck: but a summit too, —The highest summit of all! EVIL SPIRITS OF THE DEPTHS (ascending). In the deepest deeps of Night Swam the star of a far off day. A Spirit in bondage there, Chain'd fast to the sullen slope, Sat watching the lonesome ray Of that star's incertain light, With an agonising stare. Let him grieve and grope as he may Henceforth, that Spirit blind, Whose name, not Patience now, Shall by men be call'd Despair; But he never again shall find, However he grieve or grope, 'Neath Night's eternal Nay, Any light on the deeps below. For the star he was watching is Hope, And that star we have stolen away. DENOUNCING VOICES. Tempters of the height, Darkners of the deep, Midway now unite, Man from God to keep. Thus far rose the race of man, Thus low doth it lie. All that in man's life began In man's death doth die. SPIRITS UNITING. Where bare of sepulture It hangs on the rock, To the carcass the vulture And eagle do flock: Scenting the carrion, The raven and kite Follow the clarion, And feast on the fight: To his prey leaps the leopard: The wolf on the lamb That is left by the shepherd His hunger doth cram: Round the spent swimmer, With eyes peering pale Thro' the green glimmer The lean shark doth sail; The owlet by night spoils the nest in the tree: The bat tears the moth: God, that seëth it done, Sayeth never a word: as He made us are we: And so seize we our own! THE VOICES APPROACHING. Ye that forsake not whom God hath forsaken, Spirits of evil, awaken! awaken! Shake the Unshaken? SATAN. Mine Enemy, could I accuse thee now Hell from her deep foundations should send forth A shout to shake the highest porch of Heaven With most infernal thunder! Enemy, Could I accuse thee, all the Potentates Of Pain would rise to welcome to his throne My peer in condemnation! Harken all, You sightless Essences that have no voice Under the silence of Eternal God, Till Nature cries—“Too late!”—and Hell responds With all her echoes! You that spy on man, Sit in his heart, and count its pulses up, People the silent places of his mind, And set your secret sign upon his thoughts, Dog all his steps from wicked woes to woes, Gather his deeds, and lay them in the lap Of Accusation,—Destinies, and Fates, Dooms, Witnesses, Informers against man, Angels of Reprobation!—you that keep The record-book of wrongs for future wrath, Accusers all,—that are my ministers, As I am God's—in Hate, not Love—attend! Answer me, now, What fault is in this man? VOICES. We find not any fault within this Man. A VOICE FROM HEAVEN. Within this Man not any fault is found! ECHO FROM THE ABYSS OF NATURE. Fault is found. VOICES FROM THE DEPTHS OF HUMANITY. Is ours their fault who fail'd ere we began? Born to the woes we wrought not, are we bound By a plan we did not plan? VOICES OF EVIL SPIRITS. Woe to the offspring of the Fault of Man! Woe! ECHO FROM GEHENNA. Woe, the offspring of the Fault of Man! THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL. Dance we around! around! Man hath forsaken God: God hath forsaken Man! The sun is dark in heaven: there is no light from above: We must be merry meanwhile,—merry as long as we can, Tho' Nature is sick to the heart, and the Angels are weeping for Love! Hand in hand, a heedless band, Round about the Tree, Purple-gown'd, and golden-crown'd, Merrily dance We Three! One of us Three hath a cloven foot That will peep out, whatever the boot That Use or Wont may fashion to't;— Which of us can it be? One of us three hath a leering eye, And a slippery step, and a parching sigh On a red lip, draining men's hearts dry,— And the Witch knows which it must be. One of us three hath a royal gait, And a heart of scorn, and a brow of hate, And nath'less he lifteth his head elate Tho' he looketh upon the Tree. This is an ancient dance: And long ago we danced it, Round a god of another stamp: In the heart of the Chosen Camp, Heedless whatever the chance, We danced it, and we pranced it, With a mad and a merry tramp, While nobody heeded what God said, Tho' the thunder was talking overhead, And the sun turn'd sick as a languish'd lamp Whose last light sinks unfed. With a merry song, and a merry laugh Round about the Golden Calf, We danced it all together, And the populace, at as merry a pace, High and low, all join'd the race, In turban, robe, and feather: Women, as mad as mad could be, Little children, bare to the knee, Priests and elders of high degree, All in the stormy weather! VOICES FROM BENEATH THE THRONE. How long, O Lord, must we endure? How long? Avenge the perfect patience of Thy Saints Whose blood cries out o' the earth against Earth's Wrong. A VOICE FROM THE EARTH. Avenge not, God, thy Holy One on me, Whose latest hope in His life's darkness faints. VOICES FROM HADES. Release, O Lord, Thy prisoners, that to Thee Make moan, long-fetter'd in the bonds of Night, Unransom'd captives of unconquer'd Sin! SPIRITS IN THE BOSOM-OF-ABRAHAM. Celestial Shepherd of the Flocks of Light, Descend, descend the moaning deeps among, And draw Thy lost sheep in! THE VOICES IN HADES. How long shall Darkness hide us, Lord? How long? When shall the Dawn begin? [A pause. A MULTITUDE OF VOICES. Alas! no answer yet! VOICES OF ANGELS, WATCHING ROUND THE CROSS. By the awe on Olivet, By the darkness on the day, By the earth that now is wet With the blood of Him they slay Knowing not,—by all the debt Which Thy Son doth die to pay, Lord, no more thine oath forget, Nor Thy right hand stay! Ransom, Lord, Thy quick and dead, By the blood which now is shed For them . . . . A VOICE FROM THE CROSS. It is finishèd! A VOICE FROM THE ABYSS OF NATURE. Amen! EVIL SPIRITS. Haste! Away! [Thunder and earthquake. ANGELS, BEARING UP THE WORD. Earth has heard, and Heaven hath heard, And the Ever-living Lord, What was utter'd doth record! Caught upon the blacken'd lips Of the lightning-seam'd eclipse, Echoed by infernal thunder From the earthquake groaning under, Answer'd from the hearts of men By a yet unvoiced Amen, Bear we up the Word! A VOICE FROM THE TEMPLE. The Mystery of the Vail is rent! is rent! EVIL SPIRITS DEPARTING. Ariel! Ariel! Thou Lion of the Lord armipotent, Tried and invincible! VOICE FROM THE TEMPLE. The Mystery of the Vail is rent! is rent! ANGELS IN AIR. Ariel! Ariel! The covenant whereto He did assent Our God hath disannull'd with Death and Hell. Thou Lion of the Lord Omnipotent In thee henceforth the heart o' the world shall dwell! VOICE FROM THE TEMPLE. The Mystery of the Vail is rent! is rent! ANGEL VOICES. Ariel! Ariel! ELDERS BEFORE THE THRONE. Blessing, blessing, and thanksgiving, Glory, glory, rule and reign, To the Dead One that is living, The Death-slayer that was slain! In the Life is sown the seed: From the Death the fruit is wrought: Beauty buried in the deed Re-arises in the thought: From the transitory Act, Which shall perish with the past, Springs the Faith, the Living Fact, That for evermore shall last. To the teaching of the Word,— To the Utter'd Law,—succeed Yet a Second and a Third. First, the teaching of the Deed: —Of the Deed, which is the Example, In the Life which is the Love: These ennoble and make ample What to perfect and to prove, (Heir of all) doth man inherit Help of Him that cometh Third: And the teaching of the Spirit Shall complete the Deed and Word. Amen! blessing and thanksgiving. Amen! glory rule and reign To the Slain One by the living Of whose dying Death is slain! A VOICE OUT OF THE SANCTUARY. The earth doth quake, But cannot shake This corner stone of mine: The steadfast stone, The only one That never shall be overthrown, For, graved by God, doth shine His Name thereon That is the Son Of God and Man; whose Name alone Is Human and Divine. THE ELDERS ABOVE. Amen! Amen! God that gazest On Thine image in Man's Son! Man that man to God upraisest, Human and Divine in one! SAINTS ARISING. Sing ye, singing out of dust, Buried Spirits of the Just, For now i' the deadest dark of Death the light of Life doth shine. We arise, each bidden guest, From the chambers of our rest. Open, Zion, open to us, all those solemn gates of thine! A sound, a sound of voices, and of harpings, and a light As when a great solemnity is holden in the night! For the vintage of the vineyard, for the gathering of the vine! And sing ye, and sing ye to the Lord a holy ditty: The song that David sung to us upon the harp with might: A vineyard, a vineyard, a vineyard of red wine! The lord thereof is Lord of Life, whose love is infinite: For deeper than the plummet drops in Him are depths of pity, And in Him is mercy more than may be measured by the line, And the judgment that is in Him is not reckon'd by the rod. A VOICE FROM JERUSALEM. Enter, ye Saints, into the Holy City! VOICE OF A CENTURION. Verily, this man was the Son of God! VOICES OF ARISEN SAINTS (growing fainter as they pass). Fire among the thorns that burnest! Star that heaven around thee turnest! Living star of love, whose light From the breast of the Divine Brightest glows in blackest night, Down this human darkness shine! Ignis inter spicula: Umbrâ sidus in nocturnâ: Jesu tibi sit superna Gloria in sempiterna Seculorum secula. Voice the winds and waves obey! Spirit summoning this clay! Life-creative Word of God, Trumpet whose triumphant breath Calls the soul from out the clod, And awakens life in death! Audivere quos nox tegit; Tremuitque gens infausta Inter umbras; quoe mors regit Fracta audivere claustra! Hostage found we none to take Death upon him for our sake. Bondsmen of the Night, to Thee Made we moan from under ground. Thou, descending, didst set free From their bonds the prison-bound. Liberati sunt ligati, Et soluti condemnati Ubi mors sedebat, ibi Venit vita. Gloria tibi! Dayspring, of whose light is born Mortal life's immortal morn, Thou from the Beginning wast God with Very God alone: Man, with very man, Thou hast In the Flesh the Godhead shown. Eque Deo Deus, numen Verum tu de numine, Et divinum vivens lumen In æterno lumine. To the right hand of the Father, Where Thou sitt'st in glory, gather, Out of darkness, death, and doom, Son of God, the sons of men. Shine upon us in the tomb, Light us into life again! Fac ut quando morietur Corpus, nostræ sit victoria Animæ. Fac ut donetur Tecum paradisi gloria! [The voices dic out in the passing of the eclipsc—Evening falls, and moonlight, over Calvary. Joseph of Arimathea, the two Marys, other Women, and Disciples, bearing away the body of Christ. Hush! for the soldier's spear: Hush! for the high priest's scorn: Hush! lest the haters hear: For we are sheep forlorn. Dead is our shepherd dear, Dead, and the wolves are near. Hush! lest we, too, be torn. Brothers, tread light, breathe low: With no loud voice of woe Must the loved burthen we bear hence be borne. Ah, that, of all for whom his blood did flow, None left to mourn him be, None left, save only we, Alas, that left him once whom now we mourn, And could not save him, tho' we loved him so! Peace! he hath died, but is not dead. Stoop! ere he lie in earthy bed With crusht cassia strew, For savour sweet, his winding sheet. And, from his holy head and feet Kiss off the cold death dew. We will never more forsake him. To our human hearts we take him: In our human hearts we make him A deep grave, that he, Buried in our love and pain, Thence may rise to live again In the lives of ransom'd men Whom he died to free. Lord, until this Human die Into Thy Divinity, (So made wholly thine!) Deep in our Humanity (So made wholly ours!) shall lie Buried Thy Divine! VOICES OF ANGELS PASSING. Blessèd are ye forlorn, For whom The Lord is dead! Rejoice all ye that mourn, Ye shall be comforted! [The Mourners move down the hill with the body of Christ. The Angel of the Watch descends. THE ANGEL OF THE WATCH. Peace upon earth! Good will to men. All's well! [Satan approaches. THE ANGEL. Satan, I warn thee hence. Whence comest thou? SATAN. From walking to and fro upon the earth. Thou liest, Angel! Nothing here is well, For I am here. ANGEL OF THE WATCH. Yet must thou hence. SATAN. “Must,” Cherub? I will not. ANGEL OF THE WATCH. Not thy will, nor mine, decides Our places. Here, I guard the Cross of Christ. SATAN. I also. Hearken, Angel of the Watch! Hath Sorrow any right unto this Cross? If so, I claim it by my right in Sorrow. Or Sin, thou Angel, hath it any right Unto this Cross? Then, by my right in Sin, I claim it. If not Sorrow, if not Sin, What, then, hath rights upon this Cross? Not thou, Nor all the hosts that share with thee God's joy; For these He died not, and for these no cross Was needed. Sorrow's place, and Sin's, is here. Therefore my place is here, with Sin and Sorrow. The body of thy lord, Humanity Hath taken to itself. O I have heard Those woman-wailings! Verily I have heard, And laugh'd to think what sort of love was theirs That sang of love so loudly! Mark me, Angel! Already I foresee, in the new time, How men will crucify this Christ again Daily and hourly, in their hours and days: How they will crucify him in their faith, As, in their doubt too, they will crucify him! How, in their knowledge and their ignorance, How in their love as in their hate, their hope And their despair, their wisdom and their folly, Still they will crucify him! Enemy! Thou knowest that the mind of man is warp'd From the beginning of the world. Thou knowest That men will choose the evil, not the good, Their nature being evil, and the True Still crucify, still crown the False, and still Shape knowledge into ignorance. Henceforth, This stone of stumbling, where it falls, shall grind All things to powder. Neither day, nor hour, Shall pass, but what, disputing to the death Thy substance, and thine elements, man's mind Shall waste man's life about a wilderness Of miserable, innumerable folly. Pedants, and pedagogues, and busybodies, Schools, councils, doctors, disputants, divines, Shall stretch contentious hands to scribble still Even as erewhile, their Hebrew, Greek, and Latin Over thy murder'd head, and write thee wrong In every language learn'd by Ignorance! In thy name, men shall slaughter, and torment, Desolate, ruin, and destroy each other! In thy name, scaffolds shall be smear'd with gore; In thy name, dungeons shall be cramm'd with groans; The bloody whip, the branding-iron, the stake, The faggot, and the sharp two-handed axe, The torturing engine, and the toothèd wheel, Shall owe thy name no lack of work to do. In thy name, men shall brutalise God's gift Of life, ill-comprehended, till they rot Howling, or, mad with stupid silence, pass Out of Humanity, to crawl to death, Beast-like, thro' bestial filth, foul sores, and scum Of self-neglect, in desert dens and holes! In thy name, men shall utter blasphemies Undream'd-of yet by devils damn'd in Hell! In thy name, Fraud, and Force, and Violence Shall prosper in the prejudice of all That hath till yet made patience possible Under huge wrongs! . . . . Till thou, mine Enemy, The infinitely-often crucified, Even in the heights of thy felicity Yonder, and by the right hand of high God, Shalt drain the cup of bitterness,—erewhile Half-tasted only,—to so deep a depth Of wrath and anguish, that thyself shalt curse Thy new-adopted, even as they curse thee! Meanwhile, my place is here, beside this Cross, With Sin and Sorrow. Therefore stand aside, Thou Angel of the Watch! Here will I rest. ANGEL OF THE WATCH. Angel of Accusation, here or elsewhere Neither thy power, nor mine, prevails, but His That suffers us,—each in his several sphere, Me to obey, and thee to contradict, And both to serve His purpose equally. The meaning of thy mystery, and the end Foreseen from the beginning, and foreseen By wisdom infinite for endless good, Thyself, thou knowest not. Neither do I know The meaning of my own. Thou canst but view The single act of God's eternity, Which is to partial senses sensible In partial action only, by the eye Of thine own nature, as by mine I view it. And, thy perception being limited To evil only, to thee only evil Is still perceptible, as still to me Good only, and good everywhere. SATAN. Enough, Angel, I know, at what I know to mock, And marvel at this huge ado for that Which, when 'tis done, is nothing,—or, at least, Nothing in the diminishment of all The misery and the wretchedness in man, To which God said—“Encrease and multiply!” The ages to the ages, and the hours Unto the hours, shall add themselves, and men Shall multiply, and ever with more men More misery! Meanwhile, my place is here, And here I stand,—beside this Cross of Christ; Where Sin shall come, and Sorrow come with Sin, And Sin and Sorrow still shall find me here, Still ready to accuse them. And, when men Shall learn, like thee, to talk theology Most eloquently with the Devil himself, Dispute with him his nature, proper place And fit relation, in the latest plan Of general self-complacency,—at least, His presence shall they feel, as thou dost now, Here, in the shadow of this Cross of Christ! ANGEL OF THE WATCH. Mocker! Scorn ever was the sign assured Of impotency. SATAN. And of ignorance, Such tearless self-complacency as thine. Is man's praise challenged? Be man's right to blame Thereby accorded! What is changed for man? Or how is man's case better'd? What man was He is, and shall be, and so must have been, So being made. The mutable images Of Good and Evil in the minds of men May change from age to age. But man himself No nearer and no farther than before Stands, where he stood, between them. What man names Evil to-day, to-morrow he names good: And, contrary, what he names good to-day, To-morrow he names evil. What of that? He changes not his nature, but a name. Good men, or men so call'd, have been ere now, And evil men, or men so call'd, shall be, In like proportion, to the end of time. At one time this thing, at another that, Man studies to become, and calls it good: His power to be it, whatsoe'er it be, Is thro' all time the same as it hath been; In the strong somewhat, nothing in the weak, Not much in any. Cherub, know me. Prince Of this world, thou hast heard it, am I called. Prince of this world I am. But in this world I have no power save on the mind of man; Whereby whatever God for man made good I for man turn to evil. Storm, eclipse, Deluge, and the exterminating fire, Earthquake, and pestilence—God's works, not mine— Obey me not. But me my works obey, Which are the fears these fashion in men's minds, The fearful deeds which, thro' man's life, those fears Shape themselves into. Look on me. I am Man's mind's eternal protest against Law, —Man's life's eternal protest against Love. A time there may be, tho' it must be far, When men, by Knowledge reconciled to Law In things material, shall convert to good All that for ages I have made to them Material evil. In that time my voice Shall no more in man's life, as now, be heard Protesting against God's material law. But what of that? Still heard my voice shall be In man's heart, still against himself protesting. And, till that protest hath in man no place, Where man's place, mine is, Cherub; nor canst thou Here, or wherever else man comes, to me Cry ‘Enter not!’ THE ANGEL. Nor needs it, bitter fiend, That I forbid thee. For thou canst not pass The limit of thy nature, which God's love Surpasses, here. Obey not me: thou still Obeyest God. SATAN. Cherub, what more dost thou? THE ANGEL. Love Him. SATAN. Thou lovest, hypocrite, the gain That's got for loving. THE ANGEL. Ay. Love's gain is love. SATAN. Hated or loved, here will I rest. Away! THE ANGEL. Not by the length of my authority, But by the narrowness of thine, is fixt Thy kingdom, Satan. But when He, by whom Thy passing protest against permanent power Is heard i' the incompleteness of man's life, Shall, in man's life completed, have vouchsafed Its complete refutation, then . . . SATAN. Ay! then? Count me, prophetic Spirit, if thou canst, How many wrinkles to the brow of Time Shall ere that Then be added? And what then? Thou knowest no more than I. When man no more My work provides, thine own shall lack provision; Whose task on earth is but the consequence Of my procedure: temporary both. Enough! I stand by my necessity, Which is not of eternity, but time. I know no Then nor There. I am Here and Now. Standing beneath the glory of God, not in it, Man casts upon this earth, whereon he stands, The formidable shadow of himself: The Spirit of that Shadow, which, where'er Man goes, goes with him, darkening earth, am I. Unto what end man's steps are bound, whose course, Making it mark'd by darkness, everywhere I dog protesting against light, or when That end may be, I know not. But I know, Nor care I to know more, that he and I, I with my protest in man's life, and man, Man in God's glory, in man's shadow I, Have yet thro' time no journey short to make Together; taking with us this day's deed, Which yet is mine to deal with. THE ANGEL. If, in truth, Spirit of Discontent, the unknown time Of God's endurance doth, as thou dost boast, Accord such leisure thine to meditate Thy place in His incalculable scheme Of pure perfection, and thy power thereon, By Him permitted,—study this first law To which all power is made conditional:— Hate creates nothing. SATAN. Nay, but Hate destroys. THE ANGEL. For Love to still create. SATAN. And Love creates For Hate to still destroy. Paid eulogist Of unintelligible authorship, I am the only critic of God's works That do not praise them. And, for this, I think It likes Him well enough to let me be, And give me hearing with a certain zest Which mere monotony of praise like thine Would surfeit else. Moreover in this world We tolerate each other, He and I, Better than you surmise. I set men's wits To question what they scarce would notice else, And so find out what, having so found out, They all the more admire. I keep alert The Maker's pleasure in His works thereby, To prove me bungler. Yet I praise Him best, In my own way; and unto me He owes Man's worship, which was ever born of fear. Do I not manifest to men His power, Whereof a part, nor that the least, in me Put forth, completes the vast Two-fronted Will, Against whose everlasting Yes and No Man's frenzied being breaks, and moaningly Grovels in abject terror? Which to Him Is joy—the joy of feeling Himself felt By what He made to feel Him; therefore made Weak in all ways, but not withal so weak But it can bear His foot upon its neck, And, feeling what His strength is, worship it, While the bruised head the bruising heel adores. We rule, then, each,—both He and I,—by fear: And He is strongest: but I still am strong. Spake He not to His Prophet of old time, “I form the light, and I the darkness: I Make peace, and create evil: I, the Lord, Do all these things?” But half of all these things, What hand but mine the doing of them moves? The Evil I, and I the Darkness! Both His work and will: then of His will and work The great one half, made manifest, am I! If I could be aught other than I am, I would be He: and in that wish, methinks, I own Him for my God, and worship Him— Him—not this Other; that resembles not In aught the God I am content to serve. Nor serve I only, but I honour Him; Keeping in honour those that serve Him here, Strong kings, shrewd priests, and mighty men of war, And all that upon earth is honourable. But I can neither praise nor tolerate, What I protest against—this latest change Of purpose in the Ever-changing One. Here, for the first time, I seem set aside; And, could I ever weep, I should weep now For the perversity of this new plan, Perceiving what must happen presently. Like some long-trusted counseller, displaced And discontented with the times, am I; Who sees the young prince pulling down the props He spent his utmost pains on, to uphold, Based on the popular fear, the father's throne. I, that have been about the world so long, Methinks should know it: and, if aught I know, Men are not to be govern'd but by fear. When they shall lose the wholesome dread, now theirs, Of kings and priests, what next? Why, men will cease To fear me even; and, ceasing to fear me, Will cease to fear Jehovah. Heed the event! But meanwhile men shall win their licence hard, To laugh at what now scares them. I remain In spite of the new comers. Long shall Love Red-handed walk the world with Hate's own sword, Nor plant one forward footstep, save in blood. Therefore I stand here, Angel of the Watch, Watching with thee. Whose watch I grudge not. Wait. For vigil long must be both thine and mine, And we will watch together.— THE ANGEL. Wild, as waves That wash no shore, words wander. If between You throbbing lights that round us roll and burn, No radiant interelemental thrill Made response to their restless hearts, perchance The leaping lightsprings of the sun himself Might blaze in sempiternal blackness, dark To orbs beyond the never-beaten bound And blank engulphment of his barren globe: And all the kindred sovereignties of space, His starry peers whose now-fraternal fires Flash mutual rapture, then would wanly ply Pale incommunicable pulses, fill'd With ineffectual fervour. Even so, Between us twain—spirits of spheres that move In no same elemental sense of things, No corresponsive impulse interchanging From simultaneous impact of the Power That keeps in commune all the souls it sways, —Thought, like a beam that heats not, lights not, beating On unimpressive absolute nothingness, Visits in vain the waste and void of what Holds thee and me asunder. Obscure Power, Which, in the ever-fleeting substance pent Of all that passes, all that perishes, The Eternal Fire eternally consumes, What time from age to age, from hour to hour, From soul to soul, burning, it proves itself And all things else that Time, as fuel, flings Into the furnace of transforming Love, Leaving Hate's pile in ashes—pass thy way, And ply thy transitory task! Which is To feed the fervour of the fire of God, And speed its issue thro' the body and form Of all experience, which it animates. Ply thou thy task! accumulating Time's Perversenesses, obstructions, enmities, And unintelligent antagonisms; Therewith, as faggots for the burning, bound, To satisfy the everlasting flame Whose altars are the ages: whence it glows To spirits of men,—a beacon light; to thee, Whose ever-dwindling substance, in that heat Of Heavenly Love, from age to age assumes Slow transformation,—thine own funeral pyre! Dull Fiend, the more thou on this Fire of Love Hast leave to heap all hideous hatreds, all Denials, contradictions, cruelties, Fables, and fears, and frenzied shames,—the more Shall it, by all such stimulations stung To intenser force, burn from the souls of men Those multitudinous mischiefs that are made Its sacrificial sustenance. Enough! Put forth thy hand. SATAN. Where art thou? feebly sounds Thy voice, vain Angel: strong in word, but weak In act to hold what now I seize. Thy voice Floats to me, fainter, fainter! and thy form Fades further, further, further, from my ken. Thou flyest, Cherub! THE ANGEL. Self-deceiver, no! Here, where I was, I am: and what I held I hold. But thee thine ever-changing place Hath changed already. Prince of passing ills, Already in the Past thy footstep strays, Seeking the Future. SATAN. What I seek I find In thy despite: and what I find I win, This Cross of Christ. THE ANGEL. The Cross of Christ wins thee. As suns draw forth the vapours they dissolve, So Love draws Hate, Truth, Falsehood, to itself Whose touch annuls them; ever doom'd to seek Their destined dissolution. Take thy road, Destroyer, to destruction! Seize thy time, And all thy power expend; whose time is brief. Brief shall thy time be, Satan, by so much As most thy power is in that time put forth. Do thou This Tree the dismal standard make Of all the hosts of Darkness. Hither call The legion'd lies, and wraths, and wrongs, that lurk In life's yet dubious twilight. Here, where Christ, For man's sake, was by man's hand crucified, Let Christless churches crucify man's heart: Where pity bled, let pitiless priests proclaim Bloody dominion: man's oppressors all, Where hung man's saviour, here their sceptres hang. What then? O all unwise in wickedness! The faster thou, to quench this kindled fire Of deathless love, devouring deathful ills, Shalt heap together from the tangled tracts Of thorny Time all stubborn-hearted hates, So much the sooner, Satan, shall all these Be blasted, burn'd, obliterated, borne Into oblivion—and, with these, thyself (The fleeting shadow of a faded shape Of darkness in a universe of light, Like Sodom's burn'd-out guilt in gather'd smoke Above her smouldering ashes, which anon Left stainless the eternal heavens) depart I know not to what place of unreveal'd Employment in the Perfectness of Power That perfects all things. Thou, and what is thine, All pomps, all powers, not legalised by love, All forms of faith that fall as faith exceeds, All bonds that bind, all burthens that oppress, Conventions, sects, exclusions, enmities, Earth, as Hate makes it—but the porch of Hell; Heaven, as Fear sees it—but a heartless eye Fixt in the forehead of a frowning Fate, Shall surely pass, and haply pass away: But not the Word that Heaven and Earth this day Recorded. Therefore, All is well, I say. Peace and good will—God's Will—to man! Amen. God's will be done on Earth—good will to men— Even as in Heaven. SATAN. Angel, ay! But when? [Human voices of those that bear the body of Christ faintly heard in the distance, dying away. Courage, O friends! endure: Bear all things: even as He: Live—as He taught us—pure: Die—as He left us—free. Freed from the world that bound us, Let the new life begin! What know we of aught around us? We know but what is within. Not of the world was He When out of the world He chose us: And not of the world are we: And what, if the world oppose us? Struggle we must, and strive, Sorrow, and suffer pain: Die ever that we may live: Lose often that we may gain. Say ye not unto the soul ‘Rest, soul! it is over.’ Lo, Beyond us is ever the goal, And for ever before us the foe! The strife that on earth is begun, Not on earth is it ended, sure. The cause is eternal, one With the Godhead. Wherefore endure. By the evil here and there Try we, and test we, the good: And O what if the evil were Good, only misunderstood? For, knowing not what is below, We know not what is above: But that all is well we know, Knowing that all is love. END OF BOOK II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK III. ROMANCES. “Quid salvum est si Roma perit?”—Hieronymus, Ep. 91. LICINIUS. PART I. THE TIME. I. It was the fall and evening of a time In whose large daylight, ere it sank, sublime And strong, as bulks of brazen gods, that stand, Bare-bodied, with helm'd head and armèd hand, All massive monumental thoughts of hers Rome's mind had mark'd in stately characters Against the world's horizon. These, at last, Fading, as darkness deepen'd thro' her vast Dominion, Rome became mere space, spread forth, Confused and shapeless, east, west, south, and north; And, the whole homeless earth thus made her home, Rome now might nowhere rid herself of Rome. The heavens were all distemper'd with the breath Of her old age. She, very nigh to death, Paced thro' her perishing world in search of air Unpoison'd by herself; but everywhere, Like that Greek giant to whose frenzied frame The blood of his slain foe clung fast as flame, Withering the mighty limbs he could not free From their disastrous trophy, so did she, Choked by her own ensanguined purple, pant. II. Rome, in all places earth's inhabitant, In no place earth's possessor any more, Was thus by Rome pursued from shore to shore. And, in that vast and sombre universe Which was her dying chamber, 'twas Rome's curse To see the shadows change to substances, The substances to shadows: and all these Mock'd her dim eye with their delirious train. For now, from Power decay'd, in the dull wane And woeful wasting out of her spent day, Sick vapours rose that, rolling vague and grey, Unshaped the face of everything that was. III. That severe Senate, once by Cyneas To gods in synod liken'd, was become Mere kennel for the curs that cramm'd in Rome (Rome,—robb'd in turn by Goth, Hun, Vandal, Gaul, And, having all devour'd, devour'd by all!) Earth's offal,—the filch'd filth of every land: Mongrels, they lick'd each new-made master's hand, Snarling at one another. Gorged with gore, The purple gluttons of the globe,—no more They, whose tremendous sires were fain to tug For savage nurture at the she wolf's dug, With Mavors march'd, beneath the Bird of Jove, To scale the shaken walls o' the world. Craft throve, As courage fail'd. Nor, now, the People rose, And clamour'd, but the Courtier, plotting close, Bided his time, and stabb'd. Thus tyrants, dying, Made room for tyrants: tyranny thus vying With tyranny: to suit which, slavery With slavery, and fear with fear, did vie; While Roman swords, for daggers used, were red With murder, not with conquest. At the head Of Rome's worst rabble (ill revering it!) A new Religion's weird labarum, writ On Rome's red ensigns by a Faith unknown To Rome's rude sires, from Tiber, now, to Rhone, Replaced her Senate's and her People's name: Claiming whose sanction, in contempt of shame, Blood-smear'd Brutality with grim Disgrace Coupled, like dogs, upon the public place. Slander, the stylus, Treason plied the knife: And, preaching peace, Religion practised strife. IV. Old things had ceased, nor new things yet begun, To justify their place beneath the sun. The Future and the Past, contending, wrought To wreck the Present, for whose faith they fought: And, in the barbarous bosom of the new, Grimly the worn-out old world's vices grew. Some pure Patrician, in whose veins yet ran The scornful blood of sires Etrurian, Saw, newly shrined, as, frowning, past he trod, The Mother of the Galilean God, And cursed her: some hook-nosed Antiochene, Whose great-grandfather Paul's first prize had been Among the Rabbins, on the other side Passing, beheld stark naked, wanton eyed, Stout-bodied Venus in her ancient place, And spat, devoutly brutal, in her face: Some half-bred Cæsar, waiting for his chance, Bow'd to both goddesses, and, with a glance Behind him, pass'd, suspicious, on his way. V. Rome, in the main, for her part, like some grey Bedridden beldam, petulant and weak, That from her own stout firstborn's sunburnt cheek, And brawny arm, turns, captious, to caress The sprawling grandchild on her knees, and bless With mumbling lip the unswaddled infancy Whose manhood will not dawn before she die, Less loved whatever rested of her prime Than the loud childhood of the later time: And the new creed, as babes are by the nurse, Fondled and scolded, and both ways made worse, Babbling, clench'd baby clutches to destroy Both sun and moon. An empire was its toy. Donatus, with fierce fingers dipp'd in gall, Dragg'd down Cicilien thro' the councils all: From sultry churches Carthagenian To convents cold in Arles the echoes ran Of curses, all pure Christian, in bad Greek: Cicilien damn'd Donatus. Shriek for shriek, And stab for stab, with gladiatorial gust, And, clamorous, scattering cumbrous clouds of dust, The well-match'd theologic athletes strove, While Cæsar, smiling, eyed them from above. Meanwhile, amid the hubbub, unalarm'd, That “Christian Cicero,” Lactantius, charm'd Young Crispus; and in smoothest Latin praised Those Christian virtues on whose work he gazed; Discomfited the Polytheist sore, And smote the fall'n Olympians by the score; Slaughtering, with finely-pointed periods Of borrow'd Ciceronian, Cicero's gods. VI. Then, when Licinius, Rome's last Roman, saw The gods, his sires had worshipt with grave awe, By slave, and savage, pimp, buffoon, and priest Scorn'd and insulted, “Unavenged, at least, The great gods die not!” groan'd the grey old man. And, breaking bound from wilds Pannonian, He, with a remnant rallied to the name Of Jove the Avenger, cross'd the world, and came, Camping on Hebrus, to confront the Sign Of that new Creed proclaimed by Constantine. PART II. THE MAN. I. Evening. At morn the battle. Met at last, Stood, face to face, the Future and the Past. Under the wild and sullen hills of Thrace, Ominous, wrathful, ruin in his face, On the last day of his own deity The sun sunk. Mystic lights, from sky to sky, Shot meteoric thro' the startled stars, O'er regions named from him that, born of Mars, First reign'd among those snowy mountain tops, What time grey Saturn by the sons of Ops Was, in his turn—as, by himself, had been Coelus, his sire—dethroned. For Power, not e'en In Heaven, one hand holds ever. There, while o'er Rome's antique ensigns, Jove's own Bird once more Spread his broad wings upon the gloomy air, The robed Haruspices, with silent care, Prepared the victim, and asperged the shrine Mysteriously with sprinkled meal and wine And frankincense, till all together gleam'd The altars of the Twelve Great Gods, and stream'd With fragrant fumes. A shout of pride: a sound Of shields in closing circle clasht all round The central camp: where martial cymbals clang'd Applause, as old Licinius thus harangued The legions loyal to the gods he loved: II. “Romans, whose pride is by your name approved, The immortal gods, that to your fathers gave The empire they now call their sons to save, From yonder altars on those sons look down, And all Olympus deems our cause its own. With us the gods to battle go: with us Whatever rests of Rome yet virtuous, Yet Roman: all of manhood left on earth, Of godhood left in Heaven. From every hearth Where Roman sons revere heroic sires Our hearts have caught hereditary fires. Each Roman here, to rescue Rome her laws, Her gods, her memories, her manhood, draws The sword Rome gave her children. Friends, our foes Not us alone, but the great gods, oppose. False to the faith of their forefathers, they, To change Rome's laws, and chase her gods away, Have arm'd Dishonour. Such their cause. Our own To serve, and save, the old worth, the old renown Of all that made Rome, Rome. A cause so just I, with just faith, to the great gods entrust; Whose cause it is. But if, O friends, in truth, All we now fight for—all that to our youth Was sacred, all that to our age is dear, The greatness of the gods that we revere, The manful Past that manly minds admire, The immortal name of Rome's immortal sire, The urns wherein our fathers' dust is laid, The shrines they built us, and the laws they made, Ay, even the banners that they bore in war! —Were all these things less noble than they are, Yet, where, in fortune's poorest state, is he, So poor in spirit, that can endure to see Foul'd by the rabble on his own hearth floor The meanest garb that his dead father wore? Or what man breathes, tho' born of humblest birth, That hallows not whate'er remains on earth —Each frailest relic, and each feeblest trace, His reverent love can rescue from disgrace— Of her that bore him? Direr monster none, Since Pyrrha's age, hath prey'd on earth, nor done More impious deed, than this unfather'd Faith; Man's memories all unmothering by a breath Which blights the Present, strikes the godlike Past Godless, and doth the barren Future blast Bare of the bright presiding Powers that blest Our great forefathers, gone to glorious rest; They in whose names, with pure libations Full-pour'd, our mothers blest their unborn sons; Man's fair familiar Presidencies all, Whose forms made sacred even a foeman's hall! These, whom we fight for, are the gods that fought For great Achilles; are the gods that brought The wise Ulysses to his island home, And brought from Troy the patriarch sire of Rome. Them old Homerus, them Virgilius, sung: Them heroes worshipt: them we know. This young New-found half-god, Jew-born and bastard both, Patron of slaves, and Power of upstart growth, Where was he when Troy burn'd? Enough! We know Whose cause is ours—Rome's cause! whose foe—Rome's foe! Whose gods—Rome's gods! In hands, more mighty far Than ours, the mighty issues of this war Hang. If we fall, Romans, with us falls all Romans have lived for. But we cannot fall, Rome cannot fall, while yet of Rome there be A score of Romans left to cry with me, ‘Honour to our dead fathers!’” III. Proud he spake. And from that armèd auditory brake The multitudinous echo of his mind, In human-hearted thunder, the night wind Roll'd hoarse above the battle-heapèd ground. PART III. THE GODS. I. But afterward; when, save the steel-shod sound O' the surly sentinel from tent to tent, The camps were silent, and the night far spent, Licinius, rising in the restless night, Mused by the altars of his gods. II. Faint light Stream'd from the faded embers, and faint fume. O'er all his spirit a supernatural gloom Had fall'n, and that profound discouragement Which seizes on the soul whose passion, spent In stormy thought, leaves action half unnerved. In dead cold skies the dark east, unobserved, Wax'd sallow. Dead-cold influences pass'd About the old man's heart. Licinius cast His body upon the ground, and felt a Fear Plant its foot on him in the darkness drear, And pray'd intensely, as men only pray When Fear is on them. Terror pass'd away. A mystic wind was moving in his hair: And hands unearthly touch'd him unaware. III. He, gazing up against the scatter'd gleam Of the late stars, what time her dragon team The night's moon-fronted maiden charioteer Down o'er the dark world's edge was driving clear, Saw—bright above the black and massy earth, From cope to base—beyond the utmost girth Of their wide-orb'd horizons, the intense And intricate heavens, with silent vehemence, Burst supernaturally open; as tho' A bud should in a moment's time, not grow, But change itself, into a flower full-blown. IV. To his sole sight was such a marvel shown. The fair Olympians, all at once, and all Together, in the Ambrosial Banquet Hall! Each august countenance (vast gladness closed In complete calm) ineffably composed To an aweful beauty. Unendurably bare The bright celestial nakednesses were. And, far behind those Heavenly Presences, Heaven's self lay bare to the innermost abyss Of the unsounded azure. Orb in orb Of what both seem'd to emit and to absorb, In the same everlasting moment, light, Space, silence,—sporting with the infinite! For, to the universe, the universe Listening, the while it answer'd, did immerse The sound within the silentness of things. Lights—meteors—mystic messengers, with wings, Wands, trumpets, crowns—silently came and went In the profound, but lucid, element Of that unfathomable, far abysm, Wherein (as, cloven by the crystal prism It pierces, one pure ray of perfect light Doth into divers colours disunite And scatter its uncolour'd unity) Life—all the vast varieties, that lie In Life's vast oneness, loosed. Befitting form Each Spirit shaped itself from calm, or storm, Snow, fire, rain, thunder, and sea-thrilling wind: All creatures of the All-creative Mind, That makes each moment, and each moment mars Its own imaginings: thoughts, many as stars, Or birds innumerable upon the wing: Some, with congenial chance incarnating Their restless essence, and so, brightening: some, As soon as born, dissolved within the dome Of that deep-lighted distance. Underneath, The dim world, wrapt in mist of mortal breath, Low glimmering, sea and land. And all about The belted orb, close-coiling in and out, Like a sleek snake with vary-colour'd back, Glitter'd the constellated zodiac. But, over savage peaks in lonesome lands, Plains strown with battle, billowy seas, blown sands Where round the raggèd bulks of broken ships The white foam whirl'd,—and over leafy slips Of sunken lawns, lone isles, and slumbrous lakes, Where naked nymphs lured fauns from forest brakes, To roaring cities, girt with gated walls (Whitening whose mason'd floors at intervals, 'Twixt bridges piled, and dark with passing droves, Past milk-white temples, past green temple groves, Tall obelisks, and statues somnolent, Along the streeted wharves the water went Barge-laden) slided down the silent sky, Bearing disaster, bearing victory, With benedictions these, as those with ills, The viewless heralds of the Heavenly Wills, Unmindful of the murmuring of mankind. V. All vague as vapour shapen by the wind To mimic mountain, cape, or continent, That every moment changes, came and went, With wondrous modulation manifold, The vision of that marvellous movement, roll'd Around the zonèd orb of Circumstance, Revolving in the marginless expanse Whereon the serene doors and porches all Of that sublime god-builded Banquet Hall Opening, let in and out Eternity. VI. There, midmost of his kindred godheads, high In contemplative glory, and calm as morn On lone Olympus (where no foot hath worn Heaven's white snow from the summit of the world) Sat Father Jove. From whose crown'd temples curl'd The locks that, shaken, shake the woody tops Of scornful hills, and o'er the full-ear'd crops Roll blighting thunders, in storms, white or blue, Of hail and rain. Broad-brow'd, broad-bearded too, In meditative mood, with slack right hand The cypress sceptre of his vast command He, leaning forward, lightly held. All bare The god's broad chest and ample shoulders were: For gods, in company with gods, forego Disguises meant for men: but all below His spacious waist, in floods of massy fold, From his large knees the lilied vesture roll'd: Lest mortal eyes should, even in Heaven, espy Aught save the robe that wraps the Deity. VII. Firm by Jove's foot, watching the heedless play Of the low-flighted world, his purblind prey, Perch'd on the sheavèd thunders, with keen eye, The dusky-feather's King of Birds. Hard by, At the right hand of her great spouse, the Queen Of scorn, majestic, with man-quelling mien, And regnant eyes, whose large looks everywhere Were felt in Heaven, gazed from her blazing chair; Whereon, to left and right, from either side Four crested peacocks droop'd their Argus-eyed Junonian trains. Behind, above her head The attendant Iris, her handmaiden, spread Her bright bow, woven from the azure grain Of the midsummer silver-threaded rain. That eloquent spirit of the woodland air, Men call the cuckoo (which, being bodiless there, Needs not, and builds not, any nest on earth) Sat on her stately sceptre. VIII. Solemn mirth, Like sempiternal summer, fill'd the hall Where, round that Twain, the lesser godheads all, At ease reclining by the ambrosial board, In rosy circle ranged. Save one: Hell's lord, The black-brow'd Pluto. Thro' Heaven's cloudy gaps, Where lurk the lightnings, no loud thunder-claps Companion (they whose sport on sultry nights Peoples the peak'd horizon with pale lights) His gloomy kingdoms on the nether deep Glimmer'd, as dreams do thro' the gates of Sleep: From earth removed than earth is from the sun Thrice further: where sulphureous Phlegethon Vomits his sullen ooze—main sewer of sin, That, in Hell ended, doth on earth begin. There, dubious in the light by Hecate brew'd For ghastly uses, a vast multitude Of shapes—all shadows of the lives of men— Continually coming, sought the den Man's fear digs in his conscience for his crimes: The outcasts of all ages, from all climes, Doom'd by all creeds: Religion's ship-wreck'd crew, Barbarian, Roman, Christian, Greek, and Jew: Who, in the glare of that disastrous light, Gazed on each other's faces (dismal sight!) And knew themselves, at last, for kinsmen drear, The common offspring of one parent, Fear. For, tho' man change his gods full many times, Yet changed gods change not man, nor he his crimes: Still from the knowledge of himself he breeds Fears that make Hell the helpmate of all creeds, Or old or new. And, even already, all The brazen bound of that Tartarean wall, Which not the gods themselves can overleap, In windy circuit o'er the sulphurous deep, Half-Gothic towers, by Monkish masons built, Put dimly forth. Nought but the shame and guilt Seem'd real in the ghostly flux below Of swimming change, that surged from woe to woe: So, flexile as man's ever-moving mind, Whose masonry all monstrous forms combined In one immense metropolis of Pain, Tho' moor'd by Fear upon a midnight main, Yet pace with time Hell's fluent structures kept, From each new architectural adept Fresh grimness winning. IX. But all this was seen In fluctuation indistinct between The gaps of Heaven, thro' filmy distances Of darkness, wild as wicked fancy is: Nor marr'd the mirth of that Olympian feast More than spots floating on the sun's bright breast Darken his glory. X. Only, in the first Amazing moment, when the vision burst On him that saw it, Hebe, filling up With nectarous oenomel a glorious cup, Paused, as she pour'd, and stared, with open eyes And open mouth, in half-displeased surprise, Upon the wondering mortal. For he had, To her, the ever-insolently-glad, In the great human sadness of his face, The aspect of a creature out of place: As tho' into her golden cup had dropp'd Teasing Jove's Eagle: who, with a great cry, Rose, rough'd his feathers, seem'd about to fly, But, seeing Jove so quiet, droop'd his wing, And waited watchful of his keen-eyed king. Venus with glance disdainful turn'd to scan The old man's face: then, seeing that the man Was chopp'd with battle, sun-bronzed, seam'd with scars, She, whose white arm was round the throat of Mars, Pointed a rosy finger, veiling half In her soft eyes a little mirthful laugh Under delicious lids dark-lash'd. But he Look'd on his worshipper remorsefully, As some grave chieftain, when the strife is done, Safe and unhurt himself, might gaze upon His wounded battle-horse about to die. Amor, that, trifling with his bow hard by, Noticed not this new comer of the earth (He having both eyes bandaged from his birth) Guess'd, with that instinct arch to children given For mischievous occasion (since, thro' Heaven, The babble of the mighty banquet hall Suddenly ceased, a moment's space) that all The attention of the gods was occupied: And furtively, by Dian unespied, From her chaste quiver stole the arrows keen, And, in their places, with mock-serious mien, The rosy rascal-hearted child his own Lascivious little wingèd darts dropp'd down. Poor Psyche, with sad eyes, silent, apart, Sat watching her boy-spouse: and wish'd his dart Had ever been like Dian's. For, tho' now The wrath appeased of Venus did allow To her, as true wife of her truant lord, Place by his side at the ambrosial board, Yet on her still the great gods look'd askance, As a new comer, of small circumstance, And doubtful origin: and light-hearted Love 'Mid loose-zoned goddesses was wont to rove Not seldom, with no Psyche by his side: “For,” said they all, “'tis fit that one allied Beneath him, to his nobler native place Returning, should consort with his own race, Not tamely tied to a mate of meaner birth.” Such things in Heaven once, and oft on earth, Have been. So Psyche mourn'd to find Love wed Was not Love fixt: tho' stately Hymen said Much to console her, whispering at her ear “Love comes and goes: but I am ever here: Look in my face: am I not fair?” And she, Sighing, said only “O Hymen, counsel me, If thou art wise, how souls may hold Love close!” PART IV. THE PAST. I. But great Apollo in all his glory uprose. And, even as when, what time strong mountains swoon, And tremble, in a sumptuous summer noon, And all the under air is still, so still That no leaf stirs, o'er some etherial hill Round which heaven's highest influences range Invisibly, a cloud, with solemn change, Begins to move; drooping his globèd glory Slowly adown that inland promontory; So down Olympus moved the Lyric God, Majestic. All his serious visage glow'd With inner light, and music, mixt with fire, Stream'd from the strings of his Mercurial lyre, Preluding prophecy. II. Severe, he stood Above the Roman, resting in a flood Of radiance clear, and thus stern speech began: “Ill counsell'd, and rash-spirited old man! Learn to revere the all-wise Necessity, That to the unceasing wheel of Time, whereby Earth takes the shape by Heaven design'd, holds fast Man's ductile clay; and, with the solid Past Fusing the fluid Present's ardours, doth The bright fantastic Future form from both. Deem'st thou that, at thy summons, shall return To earth the Powers whose parting footsteps spurn Shrines where forever, since his course began, The Names man worships are belied by man? I will unfold the full mind of the gods, From men obscured by Time's dull periods. For man was on the earth ere we, that are Not his first teachers, nor his last, were 'ware Of his unblest condition: who, being born Above the brutes, is but the more forlorn, If missing consciousness of aught above Himself, for him, in turn, to serve and love. We, therefore, then, with gentle visitings, To earth descended; and, from lonesome springs, And hollow woods, lending to mountain winds, And forest leaves, our language, with men's minds Held commune: prompting man, by wishfulness For the divineness of things fair, to press Strong search for what they only find that seek. Until, at length, from every river creek, And winding vale, and wooded mountain, stole Upon man's sense, in visible shape, the whole Society of that immortal life Which, mingling with man's own, made strong its strife, Inspired its contemplation, beautified Its being, and, ennobling earth, allied Men, by gods visited, to gods, by men Sought and perceived. Nor were we churlish then To mortals. Wisdom, out of whisperous trees, More sweet than whitest honey by wild bees Suck'd from Midsummer's veins, to shepherd priests We pour'd in oracles; and at men's feasts Sat down familiar, or beside their hearths; Teaching Old Age how best the dædal earth's Wind-sown abundance, might, by skill increased, Be harvested, when manful Youth the beast, That's foe to man, had, help'd of us, subdued: Youth, whose yet earnest eyes in ours first viewed The images of what man's life might be By imitating gods! Neither did we Withhold the godlike gift of glorious Song. Brutish we found man's life, the brutes among; Beauteous we strove to make it . . . strove in vain! Since man's low nature, failing to attain The life of gods, but filch'd from gods their names To deify what most degrades, most shames, The life of man. Ill thank'd was all our toil! To glorify earth's clay, oh, not to soil Heaven's azure! came we from the kindly skies, Kindling immortal fire in mortal eyes. We gave men Beauty. But our gift, misused, Hath wrong'd the givers. Have not men abused Our very names, invoking them amiss To deify ill deeds? Was it for this Dian is chaste? Mars brave? and Venus fair? And Jove just-minded? Wherefore, whatsoe'er Henceforth men worship (whose base sense, indeed, With its own baseness grown content, hath need —If any price man's race may ransom yet From bondage to its own bad life—to get, By sharp compulsion of Heaven's highest will, Keen knowledge of a nobler godhead, still More potent, or more pitiful, than ours, Whose images men's hands have hid with flowers So thick, men's eyes no longer mark the frown On each wrong'd forehead 'neath its shameful crown) We, at the least, resign man's earth, and man, To fates by us no more controll'd. Nor can Man's worship mock our altars any more. Not unto us, henceforth, your priests shall pour The victim's blood. Not ours, henceforth, the names Invoked on earth to sanction earth's worst shames. Not simulating service in our cause Shall Fraud forge Heaven's approval of the laws Devised by wicked Force to sanction Wrong. Not ours the worshippers whose zeal shall throng Dungeons with dying, charnel dens with dead. Nor yet to us shall praise be sung, prayer said, Whenever men henceforth have injured men. Why should we bide on earth, and be again Dishonour'd in the deeds whereby mankind Profess to honour Heaven? “Yet shall they find, Who yet may seek, us. Not where we have been, By thrones, on altars, seen, and vainly seen, Thro' purchased incense clouding shrines profaned! But I, that from of old this power attain'd,— Having foreseen the Future,—to make fast What in the Future man desires—the Past, Have wrought for man, by means of mighty Song, A mystic world, which neither change can wrong, Nor time can trouble. And, therein, man yet May gaze on gods, and fashion from Regret Fair forms resembling Hope. Wherefore, do thou Cease to avoid the Inevitable. Know That we, the gods, who minister no more To man's ambition, fairer than of yore Thy fathers found us, since henceforth set free From all that mixt us with mortality, Range undisturb'd, beyond all reach of change, In regions where immortal memories range, Unvext by mortal hopes: responsible For mortal wrongs no longer. “Deem not ill For man whatever betters aught man deems, Or hath deem'd, beautiful, tho' but in dreams. Not by shrines shatter'd, not by statues spurn'd, Temples deserted, altars overturn'd, And incense stinted, are the gods disgraced; But by base homage of a herd debased, By Faith in service to a fraudful Force, And wrongful deed by righteous name made worse. “Nor yet, before the blaze of shrines not ours, Fail we, or fall we. For the Heavenly Powers Strive not against each other, as do those Earth breeds of earth; nor can the gods be foes O' the Godhead. Conquer'd are we not: since not Contending. Deemest thou that Time can plot Against Eternity? Fool! doth the seed Grudge to his place the tree 'twas born to breed? The bud the blossom which it bursts to bear, When Summer's summons thro' the sunlit air Shatters the long-shut sleep, whose dreams occult Are realised in sleep's aroused result? Time, that returns not, errs not. Be content, Knowing thus much: nor toil against the event Whereto Time tends.” III. Thus, frowning, Phœbus said. And Jove, from high Olympus, bow'd his head. PART V. THE PRESENT. I. There is a stillness of the upper air, Foreboding change; when mighty winds prepare In secret sudden war upon the world. And when that stillness breaks, forests are hurl'd Asunder, and sea-sceptring navies drown'd. There is another stillness, more profound, Worse change foreboding; of the inmost soul, In that dread moment when, from the controul Of life's long acquiescence in whate'er Life's faith has been, revolted thoughts prepare War on man's nature. When that stillness breaks, A heart breaks with it, in the shock that shakes Deep-planted custom, and roots up the hold Of long-grown habit, and observance old. From such a stillness in himself, at last, Licinius raised his voice. The spasm, that pass'd Across the quivering features of the man, Smit by stern speech from lips Olympian, Vext, as it rose, the staggering voice, down-weigh'd With heavy meanings hard to express. II. He said: “Immortal gods, by Rome revered! to me, A mortal man, revering Rome, did she This creed bequeath: that to all sons she bears There is but One Necessity (made theirs In Rome's requital for a Roman's name) —Living, or dying, never to know shame: Never to shrink from pain: never recant Recorded faith: never be suppliant For life less noble than 'tis man's to make Death in the cause which, even tho' gods forsake, Honour, retain'd, keeps sacred to the last. This, also, in the records of Rome's Past My life read once: and read long since, indeed, Too far to new-live now a new-learn'd creed: —That, when to all the creatures under heaven Their severally allotted tasks were given, On man—man only—the injunction fell, To do, by daring, the impossible: That he who doth, tho' dying, dauntless still, Plant the pale standard of unbaffled Will On Fate's breach'd battlements, and to the end, Defeating thus defeat itself, contend Tenacious in the teeth of tenfold odds, Uplifts the life he loses to the gods. “Lies! lies! all lies! Since gods live careless lives, Concern'd in nought for which man's being strives. Justice? men deem'd the image of the mind Of gods—a mere invention of mankind! Love?—some blind blood-beat in the veins of youth! Belief?—man's substitute for knowledge! Truth? —Unknown in Heaven! Why man, whom you despise, O'erweening gods, for getting all these lies By heart in vain, seems nobler after all, More godlike, than yourselves. “Nor yet, so small, So slight, so all unworthy, first appear'd Man's race, but what you gods have interfered Too much with man's condition to assume This late indifference to your work—his doom. Since one thing have you been at pains to do, —To cheat the chosen fools that trusted you, False gods, and filch thanksgiving, foully gain'd, For all whereto the woeful end ordain'd Was but betrayal. “What! then, all meant nought? All, all, that Delos told and Delphi taught, Tho' a god spake it? All your oracles, Your priests, your bards, your sacred woods and wells? Liars of lies! all pledged to cheat man's hope In gods too careless, or too weak, to cope, With aught man suffers! “Well can I believe How man's imperfect progress might deceive, And fail, as 'twere (man's prowess, at the best, Crippled by means inadequate confess'd!) The august hopes, by some bright periods Of his brave promise, in the mind of gods Inspired. But I, a man, no way can find Among the many wanderings of my mind, To imagine even how gods (whose godheads are Glorious with power, each perfect as a star) Should at the last fall short of hopes by them In man's mind once awaken'd. “Gods, condemn, Punish man, plague him . . . but forsake him? No! Not for your own sakes! Lest your godhoods grow, From long disuse of godlike attributes, Less lovely even than the life of brutes, Not being so helpful. “Yet, howe'er that be, I, at the least, have loved ye, trusted ye, So long that, tho' for me you fight no more, Still must I fight for you. 'Twill soon be o'er: Or one way, or another. Soonest, best, I think: nor greatly care to know the rest. One thing's to gain yet—death. No room to range From what I am! The gods may change, Fate change, I cannot. Not each casual tomb will fit The fame a Roman's death consigns to it. And I for this too-long-continued life Must find fit end: hew out, with gods at strife, Tho' sword break, heart break, all break, in the attempt, Memorial—mournful, but, at least, exempt From all incongruous contradiction vile. Nor is life left me to lament, meanwhile, Life's failure—frustrate faith, and fruitless deed! One life, wherewith to fail, or to succeed, Is man's. One only. I, at my life's end, Cannot go back to the beginning—mend What it hath made me—unlove what I loved— Love what I loathed—condemn what I approved— New-self myself, to suit occasion new. The arrow, sped, must still its flight pursue As first the bowman aim'd it, tho' since then The bowman shift his ground. Life speeds with men Even thus. And few can chuse, none change, what's done. A man hath but one mother: and but one Childhood: one past: one future: but one hearth: One heart—to give or keep: one Heaven: one earth: And one religion. “Yet thus much, tho' spent His force, and spoil'd his whole life's element, A man may do: and this, at least, will I! Ere, quench'd, the fires that still consume me, die, I will collect their scatter'd heats, push all Life's ashes, even while yet the embers fall, Into a heap, and send the dying flame Full in Heaven's face! “O worthy of thy name, Loxian Apollo! Boots it me to know That men may see thee, as I see thee now, Far from the life thy beauty doth but wrong, Calm on the golden summits of Old Song? No singer I! but a dull soldier: fit Simply to love a thing, and fight for it, Or hate a thing, and fight against it. Vent My soul in song, I cannot, I! content To do, at least, what merits to be sung: Hold fast, when old, the faith I pledged when young: Live up to it: die for it, if needs be. What comfort, O Apollo, dwells for me, Or what for any man, in leave to praise The life of gods whose life his own betrays? Their loves, that love him not? their power, that is The mockery of the weakness they leave his? Sing no more songs, Apollo, in men's ears! Leave us, ye gods, in silence to the tears You understand not! Spare this much vext earth Distracting visions of Heaven's unshared mirth! This, also, ere I die” . . . . . III. But there, his heart Brake the thought in it, sharply; as a dart Breaks in the effort of a wounded man To pluck it from the wound. O'er Heaven's face ran A tremble of white anger: like the light Of wind-blown stars when, on a winter night, The howling earth-born gust, that devastates His own dark birthplace, having burst the grates Of some grim-pillar'd forest (whose black bars Release him, groaning) strives against the stars; Their icy brilliance only kindling thus To a keener glory. Eyes contemptuous, Eyes cruel with calm scorn of all that pain Which scorch'd his own, burn'd on him. The disdain Of brows divine, in phalanx infinite And formidable of transcendent light, Glow'd from Heaven's depths against him. But all these Luminous and severe solemnities He noticed not. For, when the wretched man First to accuse the assembled gods began, Love, from the midmost rosy Heaven, where he Was sporting, stole a-tip-toe, curiously, Closer at each word, by no eyes perceived Save Psyche's, brightening while her bosom heaved With some unwonted spasm, and her sad brow Flush'd, as a pale star flushes when the glow Of the full-flowing sunset, sweet and warm, Is pour'd upon it. With half-lifted arm, And troubled countenance, and listening ear, Love, thus, in pensive posture, linger'd near Whence came that voice (among their bright abodes Ambrosial, then first heard by those glad gods) Of Human Pain denouncing Heavenly Joy. And, on the blind face of the beauteous Boy The man's look lightening, as he lifted it Defiant of whatever it might meet In Heaven, was caught, and fasten'd where it fell, By new incentive irresistible To special indignation. Even as when In the throng'd circus, from the swarm of men That hem and hurt him, some wild beast selects One man, whom suddenly his wrath detects As most obnoxious, and, in mid assault On all the others, swiftly swerves, makes halt, And flies at him that's nearest; so the man, From all that hostile cirque Olympian Selecting Love, cried to him IV. “Thou immature And mindless god! whose smiling sinecure Is but a blindfold childhood never grown! Comest thou to mock at what thou hast not known —Man's full-grown misery at the end of all The strivings of a life, spent past recall, Used out, in urging, on its destin'd way To dissolution, force that went astray By struggling upwards? Such a vapour streams From altars vainly lit; which, tho' it seems To go up to the gods, goes nowhere—is Made nothing, merged in that wide nothingness Men take for Heaven! Thou purblind lord of all Purblindest instincts! thee, not Love I call, But Lust. For man's loss, Love must needs be sad: Lust, with no eyes to see man's loss, is glad, As thou art. Yet, since men misname thee Love, Loose, if thou canst, what, pent in me, doth move Importunate, as some dumb creature curst With such a secret as at length must burst Its heart, endeavouring to be understood. O Love, if thou be Love, pluck off that hood That hides thine eyes from human grief. Revere Love's last result on earth—a wretch's tear! Break silence, Love! Thee only, of the gods, I ask . . . What is it heaves earth's sullen clods When Spring winds, wet with tears from trembling boughs, Breathe, and behold! in place of snows (those snows Themselves earth's seasonable comforters) The abounding violet! Or what Spirit stirs In tones and scents that bathe man's wearied heart With fresh belief, and bid the strong tears start For solemn joy? What mystic inmate gives Some sense of loveliness to all that lives: Some worth, tho' hinder'd, to the humblest worm That crawls; some purpose to the poorest germ That buds unwitness'd from the meanest seed: Some beauty to the barest rock's worst weed? Which, thro' all pores of Being, everywhere Passing, at last, into Man's Life; and there Changing what was (till such a change it knew) Merely, perchance, some droplet of wild dew, Clasping a thorn, to Pity; some tost sea, To Aspiration passionate; some tree, That struggles with the savage gust forlorn All night, wherein a wild bird sings at morn Exulting, to the Fortitude of Faith; In Man grows audible; speaks out, and saith To Heaven “Await me!” with a human voice: Man here, God everywhere! Which doth rejoice, And droop, live, strive, and grieve, and grow, with man: And so, completing from all points, the plan Of a god's vast experience in God's Bliss, —Too perfect, too immeasurable, to miss The manifold significance of tears, Strength strain'd from weakness, struggle that endears Triumph, and failure forced into success,— Looks down thro' all inferior grades to bless Life's hopes with Love's assurance of the end Whereto all Life, by Love inspired, doth tend! Such a god dare not be indifferent To man's success or failure: He, the Event, Which man, His Means, he fashions to fulfil: A god's means, therefore worth a god's care still! Oh, such a god, my spirit whispers me, Tho' nameless yet, and yet unknown, must be. I seek His Face among your faces all, Olympians; and, not finding it, I call Earth's woe to witness that you do not well, Being gods, to leave man godless . . . You! that tell, Smiling the while, as you depart serene, Me that have loved you, me whose life hath been Yours, tho' in vain, yours past recovery, here At that life's cheated end, to now revere What love of you hath bid me loathe . . . . “If He— If He, indeed, were—what ye are not, ye!— That God—that Love, which . . . Ah, but know I not, Too well, with cause to curse them all for what They are—and do—His worshippers? the late Last form of man's forlornness . . . men that hate Even each other! “Fair, false Forms depart! Happy in ignorance of the human heart You have deceived! Apollo, load some star With liquid music far from earth! Far, far From eyes worn out with weeping wasted love, O Venus, guide whatever golden dove Delights to draw thy lucid wheels! “But we? The men that loved you, and are left? “Ah me, What goal to us remains, whose course some Fate Impels unwilling where no prize can wait The weary runner? “He, that late is come To rule from your abandon'd thrones the scum And sewage of that rough-hewn rabble world Wrought from the ruins of Rome's pride down-hurl'd, Why comes He now, who comes so late? He too, Hath He not all too long connived with you At man's disaster? If He love to be Beloved of men, why so long linger'd He? Letting men grow familiar, age by age, With gods not destined to endure; engage, Unwarn'd, to you the homage, He now claims, And you resign; while men that got your names By heart, have now no heart left to unlearn The faith which, sued for ages, given, you spurn! Is nothing sure? Must man's existence be Barter'd and bandied thus eternally From god to god? By each new master made Pull down in haste what each last master bade The o'ertask'd drudge build up with toil intense? Oh, for some voice Love's sanction to dispense To Life's endeavour! oh for one, but one, Of all you gods, whose forms I gaze upon With grief left godless, to assure at last This else-wrong'd spirit, that, in despite the Past, Which fail'd in power, the Present, by despair Darken'd, the Future, desolate and bare, It did not ill to trust an instinct, wrong'd Not seldom, oft rebuked, but yet prolong'd Thro' strangling hinderance and confounding chance; Which, fronting Heaven with constant countenance, Would whisper, ‘I am love, and love is there, And love to love is kindred everywhere!’ But which of all the gods can do this?” PART VI. THE FUTURE. I. “I!” Love answer'd; and sprang forth with such a cry As paled, beneath their golden porches, all The rosy lords of that Ambrosial Hall. Olympus groan'd aghast beneath the sound, Whereto the throbbing universe all round Responded with a million echoes wild Of awful joy. II. For lo! the glorious child, By one transcendent moment's mighty throe, Full-statured sprang into the new-born glow Of his superlative godhead. His right hand Wrench'd from his lustrous orbs the blinding band That had for ages held their lordly light From flooding heaven and earth with infinite And all-transforming splendour. Faint and wan Wax'd all the lesser lights Olympian In the sunrise of that surpassing gaze: Like their own orbs. Mars, with diminisht rays, Reddening receded to what seem'd at last A single spot of angry fire in fast Increasing distance. Like a happy tear About to fall, Venus, a trembling sphere All pale in rosy air, descended slow. Of Phœbus rested nothing but a glow Of solemn gladness on heaven's serene face. Even Jove himself, in that expanding space Love's ever-greatening glory lit, became No brighter than his own broad star, whose flame Burns lone on night's far frontier. III. In amaze, Beneath the Face whereon he dared not gaze The man, prostrated, fell. In whose thrill'd ears A voice rang, musical as moving spheres: “The sound of Human Sorrow heard in Heaven Immortal love to mortal life hath given: Whereby in grief of life is growth of love. Arise! On Earth below, in Heaven above, Part of all creeds, and every creed surviving, The Ever-loving is the Ever-living. Heavenly and Human both: which, thro' man's eyes Forever gazing upward, to Heaven cries, ‘Behold me, Father!’ and from Heaven anon Down gazing cries to Earth ‘Behold me, Son!’ Arise, and follow where Love leads.” IV. The man Arose: and, guided by the Voice, began To ascend that solemn mountain. Changed was all Its aspect. Gone the Olympain Festival! Gone all the rosy revellers! Rough the road With raunce and bramble, where once breathed and glow'd The clear-cupp'd cistus and bright asphodel. And lo, where last each golden goblet fell, A grinning scull! On the sharp summit seem'd, Where late Olympian Jove's bright throne had beam'd, Some dim stupendous image, looming thro' Red morn's dull mist, and lurid in the dew, Till at its foot the god-led mortal stood: Then on his brow fell drops of human blood From a great Cross, wide-arm'd, that o'er him spread. V. He shrank, indignant. Music o'er his head, Like a light bird, came fluttering. And again, To that light music lured, in mistlike train, From rosiest air's remotest inmost deep, Troop'd—dim and beautiful, as dreams that creep Under the sweet lids of a sleeping child, On whose wet lashes tears, tho' reconciled With trouble soon dismiss'd, are trembling new— The old Olympians. Wreaths of every hue, Fresh-pluckt from bowers of never-fading Thought In Memory's dewiest meadow-deeps, they brought; Wherewith to deck that darkling Cross. Whereon The Past's pale blossom-bearers every one, Each as he came, fresh garlands hung. Till, lo! The Cross in flowers—the flowers themselves—the flow Of flower-bearers—all, began to fade In ever deepening light. VI. Love, only, staid. Yet Love's self changed. Whose form, expanding, seem'd, To him on whose awed gaze its glory beam'd, To absorb into itself all things that were. Heaven's farthest stars were glittering in His hair: All winds of heaven His breathing loosed or bound: His voice became an ever-murmuring sound, The sound of generations of mankind: Shut in His hand, the nations humm'd: Time twined About His feet its creeping growths; which took From Him the life-sap of the leaves that shook Light shadows from His glory. VII. Mute with awe, And lost in light, Licinius mused. He saw His own life, suddenly, as when, thro' rain And streaming tempest, on a blasted plain An instantaneous sunbeam strikes. VIII. Even then, Even while the vision broaden'd on his ken, A sudden trumpet sounded as in scorn From the dark camps. It was the battle morn. GENSERIC. Genseric, King of the Vandals, who, having laid waste seven lands, From Tripolis far as Tangier, from the sea to the Great Desert sands, Was lord of the Moor and the African,—thirsting anon for new slaughter, Sail'd out of Carthage, and sail'd o'er the Mediterranean water; Plunder'd Palermo, seized Sicily, sack'd the Lucanian coast, And paused, and said, laughing, “Where next?” Then there came to the Vandal a Ghost From the Shadowy Land that lies hid and unknown in the Darkness Below, And answer'd, “To Rome!” Said the King to the Ghost, “And whose envoy art thou? Whence art thou? and name me his name that hath sent thee: and say what is thine.” “From far: and His name that hath sent me is God,” the Ghost answer'd, “and mine Was Hannibal once, ere thou wast: and the name that I now have is Fate. But arise, and be swift, and return. For God waits, and the moment is late.” And “I go,” said the Vandal. And went. When at last to the gates he was come, Loud he knock'd with his fierce iron fist. And full drowsily answer'd him Rome. “Who is it that knocketh so loud? Get thee hence. Let me be. For 'tis late.” “Thou art wanted,” cried Genseric. “Open! His name that hath sent me is Fate, And mine, who knock late, Retribution.” Rome gave him her glorious things: The keys she had conquer'd from kingdoms: the crowns she had wrested from kings: And Genseric bore them away into Carthage, avenged thus on Rome, And paused, and said, laughing, “Where next?” And again the Ghost answer'd him, “Home! For now God doth need thee no longer.” “Where leadest thou me by the hand?” Cried the King to the Ghost. And the Ghost answer'd, “Into the Shadowy Land.” IRENE. “YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME.” Matth. xxv.40. I. The moonlight lay like hoar frost on the earth Outside. But, all within, the marble hearth Made from its dropping logs of scented wood A rosy dimness of warm light, to flood With fervid interchange of gloom and gleam That gorgeous chamber,—from the mad moonbeam Curtain'd secure. No other light was there. The outer halls were silent everywhere. Midnight. And in the bed where he was born, I' the Porphyry Chamber at Byzance, outworn By seventeen years of pleasure without joy, Not yet a man, albeit no more a boy, His flusht cheek heavy on the fragrant sheet, Slept Constantine the Porphyrogenete; When glided in his mother leonine, Irene. II. She, reluctant to resign To her own whelp that prey beneath her paw, The bloody Empire, stealthily 'gan draw The crimson curtain; with keen ear down-bent To count the breathings, thick and indolent, Of her recaptured cub: who, sleeping, smiled, By visions lewd of folly and lust beguiled. Anon, she beckon'd to the unshut door: Whence, crafty-footed, down the glassy floor Crept to her side (with wither'd features white Bow'd o'er a trembling lamp) her parasite, Storax, the lean-lipp'd, low-brow'd Logothete. III. “Set the lamp down,” the mother mutter'd. “Sweet Must be his dreams. My son is smiling . . . see! Wake him not, Storax!” Then, while softly she Let fall the curtain, he from out its sheath Slided his dagger, pusht the flame beneath The weapon's point, and watch'd with moody eye The heated metal reddening. O'er the high Bed-head (to safeguard sleeping Cæsars, slung Slant from the golden sculptured cornice) hung On dismal ebon cross limbs, carven keen In livid ivory, of a stretch'd-out, lean, And ever-dying Christ. . . . IV. (For, not long since,— As rapturous Priests remember,—to evince For God's Church Orthodox her filial zeal, Irene's righteous regency,—with heel Set on the heads heretical of all Iconoclasts, had rescued from their fall The Images of God—assaulted sore Erewhile by Antichrist's mad Emperor, That “hell-born dragon,” “the Old Serpent's grub,” “Black-spotted panther of Beelzebub,” Whom, being dead now, lodged, too, in hell's flame, God-fearing folks no longer fear to name Accurst Copronymus) V. . . . His white lips set Fast with a formidable will, while yet Storax, who turn'd and turn'd it slowly, scann'd The reddening steel, Irene's rapid hand, With restless finger o'er her pucker'd brow Flitting, made airy crosses in a row. Her eyes had settled sullenly upon The superimpending image of God's Son: And Habit,—that hard mock-bird of the mind, Whose tongue, to chance-got utterance confined, Memories by chance recaptured out of place Set talking out of season,—to the Face Mechanic response making, “If thine eye Offend thee, pluck it out,” she mutter'd. “Ay, That is sound Gospel,” Storax in her ear Whisper'd. “The thing is white-hot now . . . See here!” “And I am Empress” . . . hiss'd Irene . . “Smite!” VI. The arm'd Armenian on the guard that night About the palace precincts somnolent, Where, like a weary beetle, came and went Across the flinty platform,—else dead-dumb— The slumbrous city's desultory hum, Heard, pacing drowsy-cold, (his watch nigh done) Beneath the stars, thro' shrivelling silence run A sudden scream, fierce, devilish, agonized, Of quintessential pain; and all surprised Started upon the watch,—waiting what sound Should follow. But that dreadful cry, soon drown'd In dreadful silence, response none uproused, Save of an owlish echo half unhoused Among the moody towers, that down again With churlish mumblings in her mason'd den Settled to slumber. Then the soldier said, Laughing at the discovery he had made Of what, to him at least, that sound meant, “So! To-morrow, and the amphoræ shall flow. Increase of pay to all the Armenian Guard!” Whereat he turn'd, and (while i' the east, black-barr'd With lazy clouds, slow-oozed a watery light) Waited, well pleased, the trump of dawn. VII. That night, In league with Hell, ere morning streak'd the skies, Left all its darkness in the misused eyes Of Constantine the Porphyrogenete: —The shadow of a shadow, forced to fleet Out of the glare that gave him in men's sight The semblance of a substance once. VIII. That night, Irene, ere the Porphyry Chamber (pale With strife wherein to triumph is to fail) She left triumphant, glancing back,—her glance Fell casual on the conscious countenance Of that white Christ upon the black cross spread, Whose eyes, into the now-close-curtain'd bed Erewhile down-gazing, had beheld why those Tight draperies round it had been twitch'd so close. And lo! where late those witnesses had been, Instead of eyes, two gory sockets, seen Thro' the red firelight, stopp'd her, stagger'd her, And to a Fear, wherefrom she dared not stir Fasten'd and froze her. For a while she stood As one that, traversing a solitude Where nothing dwells but Danger (all in haste To reach the end, and, after peril faced And pass'd, proclaim “The deed I dared is done!”) Turns, by ill chance, midway, to gaze upon Some hideous gulf in safety cross'd; and so, Seeing how deep the death that yawns below, By unanticipated terror, just In the fresh moment of achievement, thrust Into the suddenly-suggested jaws Of an imaginary failure, draws Breath faint and fainter; forced to keep in sight His own success, which, seen, defeats him quite. But, soon return'd, the exasperated will, Still strong to scourge the rebel senses, still Defiant tho' dismay'd, with effort fierce Pluck'd up the keen-cold Fear that seem'd to pierce Her feet, and fix them to the floor, beneath That eyeless gaze. And at the sculptured wreath Above the unblest bed wherefrom It hung She, like a wounded cat o' the mountain, sprung, And caught, and gripp'd, and tugg'd, and tore away, And crouch'd with glaring face above, her prey, —God's Image. Still that dreadful dearth of eyes In the dread Face! With fierce and bitter cries She dasht It sharp against the marble floor, And bruised It with wild feet. Still as before The Eyeless Face implied . . . “Do what thou wilt Henceforth, and hug thy gain, or hate thy guilt, Never shalt thou behold God's eyes.” She snatch'd And hurl'd It on the smouldering hearth: and watch'd The embers quicken round It: heap'd up wood, And made the blaze leap high: and all night stood Feeding the flame: till all was burn'd away To ashes. And ere this was done, the day Began to dawn. IX. Afterwards, she became One of the world's chief rulers. Her fair name Was praised in all the churches. God's priests pray'd God to safeguard the mighty throne she made Illustrious. Three times,—in the hippodrome Once, in the palace once, once 'neath the dome O' the high cathedral,—the Estates took oath After this fashion . . . “Witness Christ! we both Swear, on the Gospels Four, to guard the throne Of our Liege Lady, Thine anointed one, Irene, and swear also, bearing leal Allegiance to her person, for her weal And in her service, ever to oppose Our lives against the persons of her foes.” This on the wood of the True Cross they swore. And their recorded oath, with many more, Among the relics of the Saintly Dead, On the main altar was deposited In St. Sophia. Four Patricians, proud So to be seen of the applausive crowd, Held in their hands the golden reins of four White horses, pacing in high pomp before Her festive chariot, when Irene pass'd Along the loud streets, greeted by the vast Vociferation of a land's applause. X. To all the Roman world she set wise laws. Men praised her wisdom. Wealth was hers immense. Men praised her splendour and munificence. Alms to the poor her hand distributed. Men praised her bounty. High she held her head Amid the tempests of a turbulent time. Men praised her courage. Cruelty and crime She scourged with scorpions. Men her justice praised. Gifts to the Church she gave, and altars raised. Men praised her piety. She in the West Treaties proposed and embassies addrest To Charlemagne. She in the East maintain'd On equal terms alliance undisdain'd With great Haroun Alraschid. “For,” said she, “We understand each other's worth, We Three.” The world, when speaking of her, said “The Great.” XI. At last her fortune changed. For 'twas her fate To win a worthier title. So, one night, The eunuchs of her palace,—slaves whose spite Her power had scorn'd,—conspiring its downfall, Pluck'd the throne from her: seized her treasures all: And drave her forth from power and wealth, to be An exile and a pauper. Meekly she Surrender'd what she had so proudly worn, Rome's Purple. And, retiring from men's scorn To Mitylene, lived there, lone and poor: A careworn woman at a cottage door Spinning for bread. The world was sad to see What it had done, then. Men remorsefully Remember'd, not her many evil deeds, But her few good ones. For who counts the weeds In any garden where, tho' desolate, One rose remains? And, much admiring fate So bitter borne so blameless of complaint, The world, when speaking of her said “The Saint.” XII. And after all these things, at the late end Of a long life, she died. XIII. Then Priests to send Pilgrims to deck her tomb made haste. They came Bare-footed, chanting hymns unto her name, And made a noise of praise above her bones, Which waked her spirit in the grave. XIV. Old tones Of some glad tune, first heard long years ago, When to their music life went gladly too, If heard once more when life, after long years, Goes not at all, but rests, in him that hears Awaken thus the wild unwonted spasm Of life's long-buried old enthusiasm. Earth under earth, the earthly instinct, raised By earthly praises in the corpse thus praised, Return'd to life. She rose i' the tomb, and said “Open! and let me forth. I am not dead. For men yet praise me, and their praises give My joy thereat assurance that I live.” And the tomb answer'd, in its own dumb way, “I neither know the living, nor obey Their voice.” The pious pilgrims above ground, Their rites perform'd, departing now,—the sound Of human praise about that tomb wax'd faint, Then silent. “Ay,” she mused, “a Saint? . . a Saint Should seek, not men, but God.” She stood before The creviced hinge of the tomb's granite door And struck it with dead hands, and said again “Door of the Tomb, since I have done with men, Show me the way to God.” The sullen door Answer'd, “I am the Door o' the Tomb. No more. Find thou the way.” XV. Even then, an awful light, Not of this world, thro' chink and crevice (bright With brightness as of burning fire that turns Whatever thing the burning of it burns Into its sifted elemental worth: Substance to spirit, ashes unto earth) Smote all the inner darkness where she stood. XVI. Whereby she saw, outstretch'd upon the rood The Image of the Christ (by Human Faith Placed there in token of life's trust in death), And on her soul the sudden memory came Like hope . . . “I am The Way!” Who said the same Was There i' the Tomb. To Whom she, kneeling, said “Teach me, O Christ (if I, indeed, be dead) The way . . . Thou seest . . . .” A Voice replied “To Me, Woman, give back mine eyes that I may see!” She dared not answer: dared not gaze upon The Face Above. XVII. That moment's light was gone Even as it came. Darkness return'd. The rest, Hid in that darkness, never shall be guess'd. END OF BOOK III.</field>

The garden of a villa near Alexandria, overlooking the sea. Noon. Zozomen, Euphorbos, and Ben Enoch, meeting each other. ZOZOMEN. Welcome, Euphorbos! Welcome, learnèd Jew! EUPHORBOS and BEN ENOCH. Zozomen, hail! ZOZOMEN. Here, while we keep in view The striving city, we evade the strife Which, pleased, we witness. In the webs of life Hark to the hum of those unhappy swarms That cannot disengage their legs and arms From out the meshes, more than flies that sing, Caught by the crafty many-handed thing That in the unperceived impalpable snare Squats, spins, spies, and devours. EUPHORBOS. Ay, the air Of Summer's strongest noon is ever cool Under these myrtle boughs,—our sylvan school. Here breathe we Spring, while, all beneath our gaze, The grass burns white against the stubborn blaze, And the bruised day on rocky anvils steams, Beat by incessant strokes of strong sunbeams. ZOZOMEN. Look yonder, friends, and laugh to see those four Brown wretches sweating down the stifled shore, To where, between the wharves, the sea-folk swarm Round yonder galley; each with brawny arm And straining neck outthrust, on bended back Uppropping as he plods, his heavy pack Of parti-colour'd stuff. I oft have stood Still by the hour, and in like mirthful mood, To watch brown beetles o'er a sandy road Uprolling stoutly each his cumbrous load, —(White balls of dust, they pack their eggs therein, I fancy)—each with hairy chest and chin Smother'd and choking 'neath the earthy globe It costs so much to stir so feebly. Probe The satisfaction which it causes you (Standing in midst of their minute ado) To watch these creatures toiling, and you'll find It comes not from superior strength of mind So much, nor strength of body, as from these Converted into consciousness of ease By the supreme disdain with which you view The thing that tasks the toiling, moiling crew. Your nothing done, because of much perceived, Is worth more, doubtless, than the much achieved Towards their little seen, by creatures born Beneath you, whom benignantly you scorn Too much to hurt or help them. BEN ENOCH. The chief gain Of life is, certes, theirs that can abstain, And stand apart. Man first grows something, then When first he separates himself from men. Life's lowest and least choice results we know And recognise in what the Many do Together: life's augustest grace alone Is witness'd in the achievement of the One. Bees, emmets, beavers, to each other seem As helpful, in their life's collective scheme, As men to men. In this alone alone doth lie Man's difference from the beasts: that man saith “I,” Naming himself, but those “We” only. EUPHORBOS. Well, The insects yet do yonder slaves excel. For they (the insects at their toil) at least Toil for themselves, and furnish their own feast. But those men toil for others, whom, indeed, They know not, or not love. Fagg'd hands that feed Mouths not their own. True, Zozomen (alack That so it is!), well-pleased, the sense comes back From chance employment on such dusty scene, To find meanwhile, among these branches green, His fellow senses, in full ease, supplied By cool sounds and sweet smells with all the pride Of a most perfect idleness. But see! The white half-moon, by yonder old pine tree, In keener curve of clearer crescent now Bites the blue air. Time to begin, I trow! And Enoch brings us treasures in his sleeve. Is it the scroll, Ben Enoch? BEN ENOCH. By your leave. My mother's great-great-grandsire, as you know, In your renown'd Librarium, long ago, Had charge of those three chambers, where were stored The Hebrew and Assyrian rolls. The sword Of the first Cæsar on this city lay Not lightly: but ere Rome's revolted prey, Recaptured thus, her wrath was pastured on, This great-great-grandsire of my mother, gone To Thebes, in search of knowledge,—his life's end, Was by an old Egyptian seer, his friend, Forewarn'd of what was doing. Wherefore he Return'd not, knowing that which was to be. And in the farthest East he died at last, Leaving this scroll. Which to explain surpass'd Even his skill, though least among the seers He was not. Natheless I, nigh fourscore years Searching out truth, have in myself found light Whereby to see, and set in all men's sight, The meaning of this mystery. It is writ All in straight strokes, like thorns. Perusing it, I find the sense runs, not alone from left To right, but right to left, as in a weft Of cross-spun threads, and also vertical: The text alliterated, duplex, all Instinct with double import; and the tongue That antique Syrian which survives among Some parts of Ezra's scripture, where he cites The letter which the Persic king indites. Such is the text. Upon the marge thereof I find a commentary cramp and tough In Hebrew with no vowel points, by a hand Unknown, which I surmise Ben Shishak's. And All this I have unriddled, and writ out, —The essence of it,—not the form, no doubt; For all made up of sounds too volatile For transmutation is the antique style: . . . . Even your elastic language locks not these In its clear limbec, whence their light troop flees In brilliance, bursting swift the brittle bond, To fade i' the boundless infinite beyond, Dispersed like falling stars. But what I deem,— Nay, hold for certain,—the substantial theme Of thought that underlies the illusive text, Here in my hand I hold,—plain, unperplext, Set forth in current Greek. EUPHORBOS and ZOZOMEN. Read, prithee read, Ben Enoch! BEN ENOCH. Then, to please you . . . Since, indeed, I know that, not alone, in earlier age, Milesian Thales, and that Samian sage, Anaximander, and Parmenides, But not long since, Plotinus, and with these (Not to name all those Greeks that follow them) Latins no few, who tho' of Rome, condemn No less the dull inapprehensive scorn Of their o'erweening West for Knowledge born Beyond the palms, before the pyramids, Where Earth's first Morn first oped her ardent lids, Were fain to slake their thirst of things divine At that same urn whence now I pour this wine O' the old bright East. . . . . . EUPHORBOS and ZOZOMEN. Read, Enoch! read to us The parchment with less preface. BEN ENOCH. Well then, thus: (He reads.) I. “In the Beginning, God, the Unbegun, (Dread Doer of the Deed that's never Done!) Made Matter: that the glory of His pure Perfection, thro' this element obscure Passing, and being thereby, as it were, Temper'd to what the strength of souls can bear, Might make rich colours in the lives of men, His cared-for, but yet-unborn, children. II. “Then What He had made God gave unto The Night, To keep till He reclaim'd it. III. “Far from Light Night took, and hid, God's gift. And spread thereon Her mantle, murmuring ‘Mine!’ And slept. IV. “Anon The æons of the Day that hath no rise Nor setting in the scope of mortal eyes Flow'd round about the circle of God's Will, I' the orbit of Eternity. V. “Until The Word,—which is the perfect probola Of Power, forth issuing from the depths of Day, Summon'd The Night to God to render back What God had made. VI. “Under Night's mantle black The embryons heard, and shudder'd thro' and thro. VII. “Night answer'd with the everlasting No Of nothing-knowing Silence. And outspread Her sullen solitary wings, and fled Further, and further from the Light, before The Voice of God. VIII. “In her brute heart she bore Natheless, the Word, that cried inexorable ‘Obey!’ whereto Night answer'd mute ‘Compel!’ IX. “So that by disobedience she obey'd, Not knowing. Unintelligently made By lawless deed the lawful instrument Of love she loved not. For where'er she went Deeper, and deeper, with her went her doom, —To bring about God's glory in the gloom: Flying with what she fled from unaware, Compell'd in her inconscious breast to bear The conscious burthen of the utter'd Word, Whose syllables are acts. X. “Stark Matter stirr'd, Put forth a pining impulse, and 'gan rouse Revolt all round its gloomy prison-house, Yearning to get back to the hand of Him That made it. Fitful in each monstrous limb The thick life throbb'd, the formidable face Twitch'd, and the enormous frame in helpless case Heaved: for, not dead, but dreaming heavily, The giant infant breathed. But blind of eye, Callous of ear, Darkness with Silence old Crouch'd by the cradle; and their dismal hold Held fast Night's prey, and theirs. XI. “To break whose thrall, He that is All in One, being One in All, Raised up Auxiliar Forces: they that be, Since man hath been, dwellers on earth, in sea, And in the fire, the air; tho' whence of old These first had birth not even was it told To Moses on the mountain. This alone Is certain: not among the Angels known Nor Elohim; but rather of this earth, Or elsewhere under Heaven had these their birth.” (He says.) Rabbi Ben Shishak thinks, and I with him, These should be number'd of those Teraphim, —Inferior forces, visible to man, Of the Invisible Will,—the Syrian Worshipp'd as gods; whose images, when she With Jacob fled to Gilead, privily Rachel from Laban stole. (He reads.) XII. “Then forth, at length, To conflict came he that in subtle strength Is mightiest of those ministers that serve The Maker's Will in Matter. Every nerve O' the intense Nature vibrated beneath His burning impulse when, as sword from sheath, Forth flash'd the Spirit of Fire unto his aim; Impetuous, thunder-bolted, fledged with flame. XIII. “He, that himself is never still, whose pride Of prowess is not ever satisfied, In his immitigable scorn of rest, With searching challenge to swift Change addrest, To do his bidding on the dangerous Deep Roused to reluctant motion from dull sleep Full many more and mighty ones beside, In warfare, waged on Night, with him allied; Whereby Night's realm was shaked and sunder'd thro' With an interminable to and fro. For whatsoe'er that Spirit loathes, or loves, To seek, or shun, his ardent contact, moves. XIV. “To run whose errands then uprose the Wind, That sightless seeker of what none shall find, And moved on the vext Deep, and strove with might To rend the vesture vast o' the antique Night. XV. “Albeit in vain. For everywhere the deep Enduring Darkness,—steadfast, even as Sleep Is steadfast round about, above, and under The tumult of some Dream that cannot sunder The slumber it makes terrible,—clung fast. And thro' the hollow dark the whirlwind pass'd, As a thought passes thro' a soul,—which, go Where'er it will, that soul still holds. Even so The darkness held the whirlwind. And Night's pall Floated thereon, forever, over all. XVI. “Then roll'd the Waters; labouring to the light That was not: struck the stubborn sides of Night, And grovell'd: for the wilful-hearted world Of waters all its frenzied forces hurl'd, To meet but blind bewildering reverse, Against the solid of the universe: And hung the hissing torrent on the arch Of hollows drench'd, wherethro' the dismal march Of Deluge, bellowing, burst, and, with cold claw Of clammy greed, into the hungry maw Of monstrous movement scraped the confused wrecks Of broken opposition. But, to vex Itself in vain, the purblind element, A rude and ravenous monster, came and went; And, mad, with uncongenial substance mix'd, Disorder'd worse disorder wild; unfix'd The hinges of the gateways of the floods, And shifted their far-fleeting solitudes Endlessly to no end. XVII. “For, evermore, The enormous Night, still motionless on shore, Still moving upon sea, was everywhere: Inexorable, ignorant, unaware, But mistress still of Matter. XVIII. “Last, in wrath Forth rush'd Fire's self upon his reckless path. Night's mutilated mantle kindled, shrank, Suck'd up the seething heat, and rose and sank Tormented, yet tenacious. For, where'er The scorching Spirit slid thro', did Night repair With instantaneously-returning dark Her ravaged shade. As when spark after spark Runs over trembling tinder; which anon To every fibre whence the flame hath gone Doth,—tho' calcined, yet unconsumed,—restore The swift-reverting blackness as before. But thro' the havoc and the breach he wrought, In rush'd the audacious Force, intense as thought, Right to the core of what Night strove to hide. There,—swallow'd soon in the abysmal tide Of Darkness,—caught a prisoner by the thing He came to capture,—made, not Matter's king, But Matter's slave,—thereafter, might not he From this material any more be free. Tho', discontented, unresign'd to abide Fetter'd in darkness and to cold allied, The radiant captive strove, till Night was fain, Cramp'd, and diminish'd of her dismal reign, To camp far off upon the cloudy tract, Half conquer'd, in a sort of sullen pact With light she loved not.” (He says.) XIX. Thus, the Principle Of Fire, materialised, and made to dwell Distributed in all things,—being thereby In each confounded irrecoverably, To all things, interpenetrating each, Gave his own leaping life; that yearns to reach Upward, and outward. (He reads.) XX. “From the depths uprose Gaping volcanos, that with violent throes Gasp'd against heaven. The strong earthquake's spasm Jarr'd underneath; and split from chasm to chasm The granite flanks of dizzy hills and isles, And promontories rock'd on tottering piles. About whose base the round sea, rolling, went To wrap the world with its blue element, Lock'd in the calm light of the crystal air. The buried Force, still seeking everywhere Fresh forms of freedom in new layers of life, Still from each hot and hidden seedling, rife With the enraptured consciousness of power, Put forth fantastic pomps of plant and flower To deck the palace of his new-born world. XXI. “Then first the centenary palm unfurl'd Broad in blue air his emerald diadem, And throng'd with feathery shafts his quiver'd stem. Then spread the pillar'd plantain, a dim house Of happy leaves, with shadows populous. Then first in blaze of bloom the aloe burst Bold-faced, and sank, and rose renew'd. Then first Slant stoop'd the cedars from their mountain height. And over all the lands, in lone delight, The forests murmuring to themselves, the seas Sounding together, and the melodies Of old Earth's morning song made music sweet; Whereto the white stars, dancing with faint feet Far off, rejoiced in golden companies. XXII. “And still, in glad and serious self-surprise, The conscious being of the beauteous world, With breath on breath, thro' bloom on bloom, unfurl'd, Grew fair, and fairer, gathering grace, from high To higher life. XXIII. “Wings wander'd the warm sky. The eagle from his mountain pinnacle Faced the full sun, his neighbour; proud to dwell Alone in light. The brooding vulture bald Peer'd out of unsunn'd crags. The curlew call'd From breezy bays. Crop-full in marshy haunts Stalk'd the high-shoulder'd pouch-beak'd cormorants. The stilted stork to guard her airy nest Stood sentinel. Down flash'd with flamy breast The red flamingo. Scream'd the scornful jay. The trotting ostrich scudded swift away. Cold-coated wyverns flapp'd with spiky wing Waste fens, in air forlornly wayfaring. And merry bills wax'd loud in leafy groves. XXIV. “The briny sounds began to swarm with droves Of silent finny shapes, whose startled eyes Peruse the serious deeps in dim surprise. The tunny, with his troop of uncouth kin, Tumbled all night in moony deeps. The thin Flat-finger'd starfish on the shelly sand Sunn'd his slow life, or launch'd him loose from land, Buoy'd on blotch'd tangles of the salt sea-moss. Grey squadrons of adventurous crabs across Wind-beaten beaches crawl'd. I' the hollow stone The hermit limpit lived his life alone. Where blush'd the coral branch, with unshut eye Xiphias, in silentness, sail'd, sworded, by. XXV. “Nor less the green earth's populace rejoiced, Each after his own fashion. The hoarse-voiced Hyæna laugh'd at nothing all night long In lonesome lands below the moon: the strong Unwieldy unicorns, about the brink Of reedy rivers trampling, troop'd to drink: The jumping gerboa in her wallet warm'd Her suckling brood with beaded eyes: long-arm'd The lean ape chatter'd on the branch, and swung: Gamboll'd the frolick squirrel: gaily rung With spleenful neighings many a herded lawn Of happy grass, where roam'd at dewy dawn The wanton horses: with embattled mane, A citadel of strength, in grave disdain, Majestic march'd the lion: lissom leapt, Or crouch'd, the wary tiger: cumbrous stept The mountainous elephant: on sandy couch Supine beneath the palm, with provender'd pouch, Mused the mild camel at mid-noon. XXVI. “The things That sail on sunny air, with splendid wings, Sparkled and humm'd: the frugal emmets troop'd To store their sandy citadel: moles scoop'd Blind chambers in the clod: the scorpion sprawl'd At ease i' the hollow wood: in patience crawl'd The many-colour'd caterpillars: bees, The busy builders, around resinous trees Sung ardent in the shade: the sleek smooth-oil'd And silvery-spotted serpent, slumbrous, coil'd In grassy twine of tangled growths: and swift Darted the vivid lizard to her rift. XXVII. “For swimming thing to creeping thing was changed, And creeping thing to flying. Life rose, and ranged Like ripples of running water in the sun, Whose mirths are many, but their movement one. And every creature, doing what the need Of its own nature prompted—in that deed Delighting—did by its particular joy Make more the general felicity: And, living its own life in great or small, Promote, in part, life's purpose, summ'd in all: As units in a scale of numbers stand So placed that each gives out on either hand His value to all others.” (He says.) I opine The text implies that all which was, in fine, On each particular part imperative, As Power's tributary, to contrive For contribution to the Life o' the Whole (Which, tho' in many bodies, is one soul) Was by the separate will that works alone In each part (conscious solely of its own Especial want or purpose, whatsoe'er That chance to be) accorded, as it were, In prosecution of its proper joy, Serving itself. Moreover, that the employ Of every function requisite thereto Was so contrived, in all God's creatures do, As that the creature's action should produce Pleasure,—the aim and stimulant of Use, The motive of Life's movement. You would say Life, wanting such things done, devised this way Of winning all that lives to serve her end, Serving its own;—by joy in means that mend The salutary sense of some distress, Which is dictatress of that happiness The creature's faculties were form'd to find. And therefore man, that is in one combined Both animal and intellectual, Most specially behoves it that he shall Secure the complex happiness of each: Whose business, for this reason, is to teach Himself, first to imagine and conceive The highest happiness, and next to leave To his soul's scorn all happiness that seems A lesser happiness than that he deems The highest: sparing piecemeal to employ His faculties on fragmentary joy. Since great joy must, greatly to be enjoy'd, Be nourish'd upon lesser joys destroy'd. I also deem they err who hold that Good Is Life's aim: rather is it—to my mood— Life's aim's benign condition: for Life's aim, In fact, is simply Happiness. The same Is Good i' the consequence. I say again What of Life's end, if all the means were pain? What if rest, sustenance, activity Were needful and yet hateful? if the eye, Compell'd to see, were scorch'd by sight? the ear Made sore by sound, tho' still required to hear? And Life's necessities imposed, in scorn, Not love, a curse to sense? The insect born, Even while I speak, where yon stark aloes throw Their scanty shades,—is born with skill to know The food, and where to find the food, he needs. What if 'twere otherwise? The leaf that feeds Might all as well destroy him. It does not. Wherefore, perceiving how this Life doth plot To bring her ends round,—get herself obeyed,— By ministering to all that she hath made To be her minister in turn,—what care, What shrewdly-shaped contrivance everywhere, —Seeing, I say, her means all good, I must Infer the end good also,—to be just. Albeit not failing to observe, in all, The means of pleasure made conditional To a capacity for pain as well. A possible Heaven and a possible Hell In the employment of all faculties: Mysterious Ezdads, welcome to the wise, Tho' fearful to the fool. One asks me, Why Is Evil everywhere? and I reply, That everywhere there may be growth of Good. Would I forego that growth, even if I could? By no means. I resume the text. (He reads.) XXVIII. “There were Two beings—of the realm that is not air, But form'd of finer element afar, Which floweth round about 'twixt star and star, And feeds with heat and light all orbs we view Thro' æther rolling. XXIX. “Brothers were they, two: Loving each other, living in God's love, As in them God's love liveth: born above Mortality: of burning Essence bright: One all pure heat; the other all pure light: Whose nature may be realised by men Vaguely—in moments rare—and only then When, by the Thinking-power upward brought, Or by the Feeling outward, in his thought Or his emotion, man approaches close To Truth,—knows what he loves, loves what he knows. XXX. “Of this etherial and seraphic Twain The names be Zefyr, Zafyr . . .”(He says.) I retain The antique nomenclature, as most fit. Tho', for the meaning,—could one render it In the Greek tongue, 'twere simpler doubtlessly To hellenise what these two names imply, (If my conjecture be not all at loss) Calling them Thermos and Selasphoros. He that illumes of him that warms being brother Spirits,—of Wisdom one, of Love the other. (He reads.) XXXI. “Now Zefyr, looking down the light of God, Beheld this earth; and saw it the abode Of beings beauteous, but unconscious yet Of beauty: each life limited, and set Apart from That which is the Life of All, Shut in itself; so, fixt from rise or fall To its own type of beauty:—there the end And bourne of all its being. XXXII. “Strong to rend And roam, the lion: bright in bloom, the rose, And sweet in odour: where the water flows Swift slides the fish: the bird in buoyant air Springs blithe: each creature acting unaware Of all the beauty in all others, meant Mixt with its own, to perfect the content Of the Creator in His creatures all. XXXIII. “But, what if it were possible to call And gather up into some central soul (The conscious consummation of the whole) All separate strengths and beauties stored in each? Some crowning nature graced with force to reach Out of itself on all sides round,—return Into itself anon,—and so discern Its fit relation to Life's other parts; Whereto, in each, Life tends, wherefrom it starts; The fit relation of all parts to it; And last its own, and their, relation fit To the One wherefrom all come, whereto all tend, In Whom is the beginning and the end? XXXIV. “Could some such soul beget itself,—suppose,— The lion's strength, the beauty of the rose, The joy that in the sea-born creature swims The deep, the bird's delight that soars and skims The boundless heavens;—by power in it, as 'twere, To put its proper life forth everywhere Beyond itself, and bring it back again Triumphant, with a tributary train Of other lives, made captive to its own By the imagining of what alone Sense notices, but knows not. . . . . . XXXV. “Such a being Might be i' the world the Eye of Nature, seeing Before and after. Consecrating so All creatures in one creature, crown'd, below, As the world's seer, conspicuous might he stand 'Twixt Earth and Heaven, upholding in his hand The censer of the praise of all, encreast By his own joy therein: the great High Priest Of all God's creatures before God! XXXVI. “‘'Twere well.’ So Zefyr deem'd. XXXVII. “Whereat, on him there fell Thro' all the solemn and symphonious psalm Of seraphim that sing 'twixt palm and palm Of Paradise, a sadness, soft, profound, As of a silence hid within a sound. XXXVIII. “Zafyr, perceiving that, where'er they went Together, Zefyr's brow was downward bent, Not upward, as of old, in council drew His brother forth. XXXIX. “'Twas when the evening dew Was on the silent summer woods, the Star Of Even smiling fair, serene, and far Over the lone bright lands and waters wide Of the young world. All-spying, unespied Of beast or bird, in midst of bird and beast, On a mountain summit in the furthest East These Spirits sat in converse. XL. “Zefyr said To Zafyr, answering as the heart to the head Makes answer prompt, with no dull need of speech, In some full-natured man: XLI. “‘Look forth! and reach With me, where runs my thought around the rim Of this green world, that in the light of Him That made it, lyeth sleeping with shut eye And but half-beating heart; not knowing why It is, nor in whose Hand it lieth there. How fair to spiritual sight! so fair That we, God's Seraphs, from our sphere descend To bathe us in its beauty, and so send The fuller strain of a refreshen'd praise To Him that made, and grants it to our gaze. XLII. “‘And yet how ignorant! how blind! so blind Of being, that,—albeit we, that wind Where'er the Maker's Will thro' Matter moves, Delight, therewith, to wander these warm groves, Or from the meditative mountain tops At morn or even, when the sweet light drops Or rises, watch the wondrous going on Of God's great work therein,—means hath it none, Nor knowledge, nor desire of any way To speak with us, to answer what we say, Rise and respond to that supernal sphere Whereto, not knowing this, it lieth so near. Of it we know: it knoweth not of us. XLIII. “‘What keeps the beauteous exile cancell'd thus From all communion with the Life that's whole In Spirit only? Surely 'tis a soul Yet wanting.’ XLIV. “Then, an answer from Above Was utter'd unto Zefyr: ‘Spirit of Love That lookest downward, to all souls of Mine That, looking, loving, downward,—as doth thine,— Love that which is beneath them, it is given To follow where love leadeth: down from Heaven To Earth, from Earth to Hell: and there, made one With what they love, to employ their love thereon, Living their life therein. That love may so Fill all creation, up and down. Whereto Is this condition fixt: That, never more The loftier nature may its life restore, Nor place resume, at that first point assign'd Its process in My purpose, till it find Strength in itself to uplift there,—not alone Itself,—but, with itself, that lowlier one Whereto its love allies it. If in this It triumph, then the sphere it soars to is Diviner, loftier, lovelier than before; Enlarged by life, not single any more, But twofold. For, what strength the spirit needs To painfully recover, by slow deeds Accumulated from the clutch of Time And Circumstance, in action, that sublime First starting-point of Love's self-sought career, Impels its upward impulse to a sphere Superior even to that which, in descent, It for Love's sake surrender'd. In the event Such spirits, My participators, win At the Right Hand of Greatness, highest within High Heaven's secret sanctuary, a throne Reserved for those Experiences alone That have advanced My Purpose: which doth move Not only to create, but to improve Life in the highest and lowest,—life in all: Whereof the progress is perpetual. But if the lord o' the loftier sphere do fail, Bound to base engines, upward to prevail With the low consort of his choice, twofold Shall be his failure; failing to uphold Himself where first he 'lighted from above, And failing to uplift what he doth love; And they shall sink together. And, because What Is is infinite, all power, that draws Upward or downward, urges up or down Whate'er it meets with and can make its own, Forever and forever.’ XLV. “Zefyr heard Glowing: and answer'd, ‘Good, O Lord, Thy word To him that hears it, ever! Let mine be The task with Matter to return to Thee.’ XLVI. “But Zafyr cried, ‘O Brother, go not thou! What of the load laid on thee canst thou know? Or of thy power to lift it from beneath? Behold! it lieth, sleeping in the breath Of its own beauty, as thyself hast said, This world, whose blind brute heart-without-a-head Dreameth not aught between itself and God. Once wake it,—make it 'ware that in the sod, Now smiling all unconscious, stirs a soul, And will not Matter murtherously dole To such a troublous tenant,—if not death,— Pain, dreadfully prolong'd on every breath That troubles Matter? What Earth's dwellers be Is best unbetter'd. Bid such beings see A life above them, better than their own, —A constantly-receding splendour shown Never to be secured—a point i' the play Of power, perpetually drawn away, Albeit perpetually present still To life's unsatisfied pursuit—how ill Even to themselves must all they be and do Then seem, confronted with the maddening view Of such a prospect, endlessly at hand, Endlessly distant. What contrivance, plann'd For pain, more potent than such gift, whereby The Better seen must needs incessantly Condemn the Good possess'd?’ XLVII. “Zefyr, meanwhile, Saw, watching wistful with a serious smile, Among her lucid orbs, the pallid Night Returning softly, in sad peace with light, Over the waters to the west: and said— XLVIII. “‘Lo, everywhere, tho’ pent and prostrated, How Fire, forerunner of the force in me, Hath vindicated in his own degree A noble nature in base circumstance; Whose very pain doth yet his power enhance! What was this world, ere in it waken'd those Stupendous pangs, those passionate birth-throes Of Beauty, the predestined fruit of Power? Even to make possible yon bell-prankt flower That trembles sweet i' the solitary air, What earthquakes quicken'd, what mad mountains were Cast up, crusht down: of whose so difficult And dismal labour, lo, the last result, —A little flower that knows not its own worth! Ay, but the flower's mere beauty wins to earth A Seraph. What, now, if that Serpaph's heart, Hid in this world, had place to play its part, Express its passion, vent its vehemence? What—of a nature nobler, more intense, More beautiful, more complex, more complete— Might rise therefrom the gaze of God to greet? Perchance, some lovelier flower, of statelier life, Sprung, not from Matter's toil, but Spirit's strife, Might, breathing beauty from its native sod, Win down to earth,—no seraph, but a god! Belovèd, I descend. I shall return.’ XLIX. “‘When?’ “‘When God wills. I know not. I shall learn.’ “‘Too late, perchance. Thou goest alone?’ “‘Not lonely. Strong helpmates have I with me.’ “‘Whom?’ L. “‘Two only: Faith-in-the-Future, Memory-of-the-Past. And, doubt not, these Two shall beget me fast New families of Spirits, born to know (God granting) whence I am, whither I go: Poets, and Martyrs. But, since I must needs Pass lone from where thy placid Essence feeds Its intellectual life, to lower forms, Thee, Brother, thee,—tho' housed in dust, with worms, Still let me feel not far,—where'er perchance, Cramp'd in cold clasp of clay-born Circumstance, I, from my new probationary toil, Look upward with the love earth cannot soil; —Still as of old, dear Spirit, in our august And grand communion, lifting, tho' from dust, Looks that in thine the love that lights them now Shall find unchanged! And, if God's grace allow This long-pent passion to attain in time Some eminence of Nature, more sublime Than Earth yet holds,—there, Spirit, if that may be, Stoop thou to meet me, who shall rise to thee, Nor wholly miss thee, where I soon must live, I' the myriad moulds God doth to Matter give, Wherein life beats: therewith my course pursue Trusting to feeble faculties: renew Full many times a patient purpose oft Frustrate: and labour to the light aloft By many darkling, many devious, ways: And breathe, perchance in pain, vext hymns of praise Thro' harshest instruments. Thou, therefore, be Wherever I at length may lift to thee, In some yet unborn being, eye or ear Appealing for communion. I shall hear Thy voice, and see the beauty of thy face, And comfort me. Thereby shall some new Race Take note that Heaven is glad of Earth's endeavour, And Spirit doth to Spirit answer ever!’ LI. “And Zafyr, sorrowing: ‘Wheresoe'er thou art, Trust me, my being must with thine take part, Dear Spirit, with thine my hope, with thine my will! And Zafyr shall to Zefyr answer still, Prompt as of old, and clear as chord to chord Of Heaven's mid-music, if new forms afford To ancient forces their familiar play Of interchange, Love's mandate to obey.’ LII. “Then Zafyr's kiss thro' Zefyr's being stole Burningly. And behold! a living soul In Matter” . . .(He says.) Something from the text is lost Which to recover, the vain hope hath cost To me much labour, long research, and some Discomfiture; for not the palindrome Nor yet the comment, after or before, Aids my distress'd conjecture to restore The perisht page I still am searching for.(He reads.) . . . “Night answer'd to her august visitor ‘Spirit, my consciousness is made confused By cross experience, and a sense, unused, Of wants, to me not welcome. This I know: That all things serve The All—I, even as thou. Spirit, I know that Matter is His child. But Matter's nurse am I. For thus He will'd. And me the infant knows and answers . . . see! . . . Not knowing yet its Father. If to thee 'Twill answer,—try! I know not. Yet I know Many, and mighty ones, have been ere thou: Who came to mock, and still remain to mourn.’”(He says.) Here also is the cryptic writing torn To my much sorrow. It continues thus. “After that time the Earth wax'd populous With pageantries of prouder life, improved By wider play of worthier power: which moved Majestic in the forward march of Fate, Thro' statelier periods of more intricate Contrivance, with superior pomp. Erect Of stature, and serene of intellect, The august procession to a glorious goal Rose, and confronting heaven with human soul, Matter, self-conscious, to emerge began Forth from the merely mammal into Man. LIII. “Thus, at the last, appear'd Humanity. Whereto was given the hand of a man, thereby To imitate the thought of an angel: fit And supple slave o' the spirit that doth sit Within it, ruling it: made lord and king Of all Earth's tribes, that to the governing Of man were given; since, in man's nature, theirs Is gathered up, and given forth. LIV. “Vast stairs Of various range, ascending to some shrine Wherein a God is worshipt, so combine With the whole fabric's purpose. From below, Who sees, up their thick-trodden labyrinth, go, Pushing or pusht, the multitudes betwixt, The statues and the symbols each side fixt, Perceives not more in those throng'd temple stairs Than that each, graced with its own sculpture, bears In its own beauty its own import plain. But he that, mounting up them, doth attain The god-like Image on the glorious height, Where all parts of the Maker's plan unite Their several uses, must perceive anon The Temple and the Temple-stairs be one.”(He says.) Friends, 'tis well known to you, what from of old Our Rabbins held, as still our Rabbins hold, That, even as in Noë's ark combined Lived, not alone the whole of human kind, But also all the creatures that God chose For patterns and progenitors of those Which should be after, when He loosed the flood; So also lived in Adam's life the brood, Not only of all generations then Yet unborn, and all families of men, But also all the low lives of earth, All creatures whose creation by man's birth Was bound together, and in contact brought With Spirit by the motions of man's thought. Since man's thought lends a soul to everything That man's thought lives in. Therefore is he king Of all the creatures. (He reads.) LV. “Thus man's consciousness Was troubled by the sense of More and Less. And, even as one that bears a dubious name, Born of high lineage, yet the child of shame, Sprung from a monarch's loins, albeit the fruit Of a slave's womb; so, kindred to the brute, Yet conscious of an angel ancestry, Man walk'd his vassal world with restless eye, Now turn'd impatient, or in proud self-scorn, On his low native dust, now raised forlorn In vext desire to his high native skies. LVI. “Now, therefore, Zefyr, gazing through man's eyes, Sought his kin Seraph: from whose bright embrace Was born a nobler and a mightier Race, —Mightier than man's,—which man himself obeys,— Of beings for whose service in all ways, And sustenance, man's race was made. LVII. “For These, Which are man's lords, using man's life to please Their purpose, as man uses, to his own, Earth's lower lives, whereof dominion To him in turn is given, are, indeed, Scarce bound to Matter by mere bodily need, As man is; but have power upon man's mind To make it ply whatever task they find Fit for their purpose; mastering Man, as he, For their sakes, masters Matter. LVIII. “These, then, be The world's essential substances. To whom Man's life is, from its cradle to its tomb, Subordinated: unto whom man gives The best part of his being: whom he lives To serve, and perishes to please.”(He says.) Thus far The text. The comment here . . . .(Reads.) “For men's lives are To these as sustenance. Mark how, of old, Men held what I, alone of moderns, hold,”(Says.) Ben Shishak's known philosophy in this I recognise, and know the gloss for his. (Reads.) “Namely: that this thrice-complicated world, Whereof man stands i' the centre, holds enfurl'd, And superposed as 'twere, three orbs distinct Of Life. Each diverse, tho' together linkt By Life's one law for whatsoever lives, Whereby of each Earth gains, to each Earth gives, What helps in turn, the End-all, and the Be-all: One Animal: one Human: one Ideal: Three circles of one sphere. Of these, the least And lowest, is the kingdom of the beast, Which man commands: who holds the middle place Between Earth's lowest, and her highest, race. But that which is the loftiest of the Three, Sole region of Ideas, I take to be: Which man, in truth, subserveth and obeyeth, As him the brute beneath him. Whoso sayeth A man's ideas to a man belong, Knoweth not what he saith, or argueth wrong. Far rather, I imagine, doth the Man Belong to the Idea. For neither can The Man command the Idea, nor deny Submission to its mandate. Can he fly From its pursuing? or its path dictate? Or summons, or dismiss, or bid it wait, Or hasten—here advance, and there stand still— Now active be, now passive—at his will? And, if it live not servile to his whim, Say, can he slay it? Doth it not slay him, Inexorably, with no mercy shown, As he would slay a beast that is his own, If his death, rather than his life, promote That end whereto the Idea doth devote The Man it uses? All as well my mule, Whose footsteps I by staff and bridle rule, Might think he rules me,—goeth by the road His choice, not mine, selects, nor own the goad, As that, for my part, I should boast to be The lord of that ideal lord of me Whose force I follow, and whose burthen bear, Not as I will, but as I must, where'er He goads me. And, if this brute mule of mine Should lord it o'er his fellow mules,—opine Himself the sage whose way is Wisdom's track, Because he bears my wisdom on his back, Were not his folly all the worse? ‘What then,’ One asketh, ‘arguest thou, apart from men, Ideas can exist? doth not man's mind Create the Ideal?’ Nay, friend, for I find Ideas make men, not men ideas. They The dwellers of the ideal world, I say, Are independent of mankind so much As man is of the brutes. No more. For such As is mankind's requirement of a race Beneath it, born to serve it,—in like case Is man. . . . Oh not by any means the lord, But sturdy servitor, of that dim horde Of dwellers on his brain; which, truly, need And freely use,—to bear them, or to feed,— For pasture, or for burthen, as may be— Man, for their sakes created. Natheless he Doth commonly consider and declare That he is Something Great, because aware Of Something Great within him. In like way I dream'd the dial to the beam did say ‘Lo, I am Time!’ A little wind was waked, Across the sun a little cloudlet shaked, And the vain index of the heedless hour Relapsed to nothingness. In many a flower The moth and grub their dubious egglets hide. Can the flower choose, or doth the flower decide What to the summons of the sun shall rise From her chance treasures to amaze men's eyes? This launches, sapphrine-mantled, mail'd with gold, Some warlike wyvern beautiful and bold, Fit for the Persic fay that rides to woo His shy queen, gaily, in her globe of dew: That sends forth, barely fit to browze on burrs, A monster hateful as the imp that spurs His sooty flank, and hums a hell-born hymn, Forth venturing darkly when the air is dim. I can but laugh, not seldom, in my sleeve, When I look round the world, and there perceive How men have builded monuments of brass To others on whose brains the whim it was Of some Idea, on its sightless way About the world, to settle, seize, and prey. Why should the beasts, man scorns, not also raise, After their fashion, some such baaing praise About the sure-foot horse man drives, the ox He ploughs with, or the fatlings of the flocks Man kills for his best banquet? Now, I deem That in the purpose of the One Supreme Man is not, as he holds himself to be, The highest necessity on Earth. But he, Born for the service of Ideas alone, Is for their sake, as they are for their own. Notice, which most concerns, most occupies, That Providence whereby man lives and dies: Men or Ideas? An Idea hath need Of growth,—full scope to satisfy its greed Of power, and multiply, and propagate. To meet which, man is there i' the mass. Now wait. What happens? mark the issue. Men must perish Wholesale, it may be, or piecemeal, to cherish, Enrich, and ratify, the otherwise Starved and pent life this one Idea tries To nourish at men's cost; itself or these Succumbing. Which doth the World's Ruler please To rescue or confirm? Why, horde on horde Nature, to serve her supernatural lord, Of her selectest human children gives. Little accounts she their mere deaths or lives! 'Tis but a race to ravage, but a realm To wash away in blood, expunge, o'erwhelm. Doth Nature shrink from,—Providence impeach,— The sacrifice required? Men's bodies bleach On bloody battle-fields uncounted. Men Born to be used thus: ended there and then, Their use being over. Dead and done with, they! Yet not in vain, do after-comers say, Lived they or died they, since their lives and deaths (Else vainly born and buried in vain breaths) Have served to manifest, make eminent The Idea for which they lived and died, content. But to themselves, who doubts these men's lives seem'd Of all-surpassing value? Each was deem'd By the dead owner of it something worth The special cherishing of Mother Earth. And if to save and foster man's life were Earth's, or Earth's Arch Disposer's chiefest care We must, for those men's sakes (whose life, pour'd forth Like water, seems mere waste of what was worth Such frustrate forethrift, care so baulk'd of gain, In the fine fashioning of nerve and brain) Attribute failure vast, or drear neglect, To Earth's great Justicer and Architect. But He,—that wrecks man's life i' the sharp ordeal Which rescues life's pure essence from the unreal, The false, the fleeting—heeds not how it fare With the mere Human, born for death: whose care Is for the Ideal that doth never die. The human swarm swims, in its season, by: Races on races rise and roll away: The generations flourish and decay. What laughing Phantom leads, and mocks, the dance Of these blind mummers thro' the Masque of Chance? Lives on the life that from their lips it drains, More glorious waxes as their glory wanes, Brightens its deathless eyes in that fine air Whose ardent essence man's prolong'd despair Feeds with the fires that waste it, and doth dwell On dead men's graves, deathless, impalpable, Made of immortal element, the pure Result of man—man's life that doth endure Above the dust man drops in? What survives Save this, the ceaseless dying of men's lives? Egypt and all her castes—bold Babylon, Beautiful Hellas—Rome's Republic—gone! What rests, on earth, the lone result of these? The airy, but immutable, images Of their Ideals, in the life that lies, To light our own, above us. Starrier eyes Than ours are on us. Egypt's Thought, the Grace Of Hellas,—now no more to render place To Rome's strong Will,—the stout town-stealer . . . There Behold man's bright pall-bearers—they that bear On their calm brows, for costliest coronal, The symbols of the summ'd-up ages all. Much musing on these things, I doubt not, then, Ideas are of more account than Men In that grand purpose which to further here Each of Earth's tribes was, in its several sphere, Created.”(He says.) Here the text, whereto I turn Again, grows dubious—dark. Let him discern, That can, its meaning!(Reads.) LIX. “Thus Ideas grew With human growth. Thus heavenly heralds blew The trumpet of the triumph of the Earth. For Fire, at first, with Matter mixt, gave birth To breathing Life in beauteous flesh and blood. Wherefrom anon (by its blind beauty woo'd With clay to keep celestial company) The Angelic Essence wrought, and raised on high, Man, Earth's immediate monarch. Thence, thro' man, Soon as the Earth-Spirit to commune began With his unearthly kindred (lest forlorn Of Heavenly love should be Earth's life) was born The race of Earth's Ideal denizens, Monarchs of men, whose life is more than men's. Then, last of all, thro' these,—as first of all, Thro' Man, was Matter in the Animal Made 'ware of Spirit,—did man's self (the abode Of Spirit) wax in the Spirit aware of God. LX. “And man, scarce started on his glorious race, Seem'd night to touch the goal, when . . . What strange face Of deathful beauty, with disastrous eyes, —The wanton nurse of woeful destinies, Rose on the road before him, unforetold, To flatter to his fall him overbold In passion,—him by fairest form beguiled To foulest worship? What portentous child, From the accurst incongruous union bred Of what Ideal to what Bestial wed, Arrests man's course yet? For behold it there In the world's midst, arisen at unaware, With its brute body and its brow divine,— Man's curse,—the Everfatal Feminine! The beautiful abominable one, The watcher on the threshold, in the sun, The lion-woman with the 'luring eye, The inhuman riddle of humanity, The weakness that is more than strength, the beast That hath the brows of Power, and the breast Of Beauty, and the body of Disgrace, The Eternal Discord, with the dubious face! LXI. “Not causeless came the Curse of Sense. For when The ideal world was felt i' the world of men, From its strong action this re-action rose: (As first, most fruitful, offspring of the throes Of Spirit in Matter made parturient) The consciousness of Beauty. Ill content With merely being, man aspired to make Man's being beautiful; and, for the sake Of beauty, with unbeauteous circumstsnce Contended. But, incompetent to 'advance Except by sensuous aids, he halted there Where his five guides, the Senses, cried ‘We fare No further.’ There, soon satisfied to rest With these, he built him temples, altars drest, And statues shaped, and incense burn'd . . . and lo, From out the incense fumes, with eyes aglow To catch him, rose that Curse! Whereat . . .” (He says.) LXII. O friends, Suddenly, sadly, here the writing ends. —Or rather, not the writing, as first writ By him, whoe'er he was, that fashion'd it Of old,—but all, alas! that time and fate Have spared of this torn scroll; at what sad date Thus mutilated, I divine not. Long Hath been my labour to repair the wrong By some rash hand, to me unknown, done here. And all in vain! tho' many a weary year My wandering search hath been most diligent. Byzantium, Athens, Rome—where'er I went— Thebes, and the ruin'd cities in the sand, And wheresoe'er report from land to land Denoted any learnèd Greek or Jew, Studious to store all crumbs of knowledge, who Might haply help me . . . nowhere have I found The missing text. So that on broken ground I seem to stand, as one that, with full heart And lightly-bounding step, erewhile 'gan start Bold on his journey to some far off spot Reach'd only by untrodden ways—some grot Hewn high up in a mountain land—the occult Abode of that rare sage, whom to consult On things of weight the man sets forth in scorn Of peril by the way; and finds, tho' torn To bleeding, hand and foot, by stone and briar, The secret clue; and, taking heart, yet higher And higher, clambers on 'twixt flint and stub, Escapes the wild beast's paw, the robber's club, (For bandit hordes infest the rocky height, And from the thickets wild beasts roam by night) But night and day he, chaunting hymns, fares on, Surer and surer of the road. Anon, Some dawn, at sunrise, hath he reach'd the peak Where dwelt the sage he fared so far to seek, And lo! the hermit strangled at the door Of his own cave. That man shall never more Have his doubts answer'd. No result remains, But pure conjecture, after all my pains. Much hath been saved, tho' much is lost: and more Even than enough to make me much deplore That so much saved, because of so much lost, Should leave so unrequited care that cost Such time and toil to save it. Question vain! Shall Zefyr, help'd of Zafyr, yet regain His native element original? How shall it fare with man? What end of all That Spirit's incarnation? Tell me you, Whom well I deem this city's wisest two, What think you is the import of the words Where my conjecture halts? ZOZOMEN. What's saved affords No indication of what's lost. Divine Who may what means that “Fatal Feminine,” I cannot. And methinks no such strange phrase Was needed to imply, what none gainsays, That woman, ever since the world began, Hath been a beauteous mischief unto man. BEN ENOCH. No. I dismiss that meaning. EUPHORBOS. And elect What other? BEN ENOCH. One, which doth, indeed, deject And sorrow me most sorely. For I see That man, being twofold, body and soul, must be Against himself divided ever more; Never at unison with life; so sore The strife is 'twixt the body and soul. In just So much as, discontented with mere dust —Which is its native natural element, The body, prompted by the spirit pent Within it (which—a prisoner—doth conspire Against its hapless gaoler), may desire To pacify the querulous spirit, and do Its mandates, run its errands to and fro, In search of joys not for the body meant, The soon-tired body's certain discontent Dismays the spirit. And man fails that way. Whilst, in so much as, willing to obey The bidding of the body, heard in turn, And humour thus the helpmate it would spurn But cannot, the compliant spirit spares, To deck the burthen its associate bears, Some casual grace, some flying flavour lends To spice the joys whereon the body spends Its fleshly appetite,—the spirit's soon Enkindled scorn of its own wasted boon, And prompt disgust of what it deign'd to do, Dismays the body. Man fails this way, too. But, say the spirit triumphs. And what then? Death. For it kills the body. Or, again, Suppose the body triumphs? Again, death. It kills the spirit. Whilst, with hinder'd breath, The two conspire each other's failure, life Indures, indeed: but how indures? At strife. But in this scroll a hope, methinks,—nay, more, A promise, seem'd vouchsafed. What I deplore Is that, enough remaining of the scroll To testify that, could we read the whole, Fulfilment of that promise would be shewn, The missing end, which cannot now be known, Leaves, by extinguisht founts, desire awaked To fiercer thirst, with all that thirst unslaked. So bright the opening promise! But just here, Here where both text and comment disappear In a great gap of doubt, . . . man's prosperous march Seems stopp'd by Sense, just where thro' Time's near arch First gleams the Spirit's glorious goal. As when That Carthaginian host, with Rome in ken, At Capua caught, forewent the long-wisht end Deserved by toil thus far endured, to spend On pleasure premature, upon its way, Forces first arm'd to seize a nobler prey. The conquer'd, thus, the conquerors captive take. Thus would-be Cæsars turn, with worlds at stake, By captive Cleopatras captured fast, Let worlds escape them, and are lost at last: Thus, the Ideal Beauty, by the sense Itself hath kindled into vehemence O'ertaken, is in sensuous fetters fasten'd: Thus man's defeat his first success hath hasten'd: Thus, the old question vain returns again; And, just where all seem'd gain'd, all's lost for men. Which things perplex me. EUPHORBUS. Hush! we are o'erheard. Who is yon stranger? ZOZOMEN. Not a leaflet stirr'd Among the myrtles: on the path no stone Cried out: and thro' the gates not any one Can pass unchallenged. How, then, came he here? BEN ENOCH. A man of most strange aspect. EUPHORBOS. He draws near. ZOZOMEN. Mark him! THE STRANGER (approaching). Peace be unto you, brethren. Much I marvel, O Ben Enoch, that on such A mind as thine, inquisitive of all Light's rays, such mere interposition small Should cast such shadow. A man's hand, no doubt, Is not so small but what it can shut out God's sun, if only thro' a single hole The sunlight enters. But to thee the whole O' the world is open'd. Seest thou not, altho' The conquer'd do the conquerors conquer, slow But sure from out such conquest comes a new And nobler triumph born of both? Thou, Jew, Were not the Roman master (as he is) Of all thy race, how should thine master his By knowledge, veil'd from Lars and Lucumon, Yet view'd by Israel ere the Roman won A rood of barren earth for that first plough Beneath whose yoke the world's self labours now? The Ideal thus, tho' by the Sensuous held In bondage for a while, doth work and weld All to itself, till form be fill'd with soul. And, if indeed the story of thy scroll Holds ancient warrant, as thou dost believe, Deem'st thou the toil of Matter could so grieve A Spirit's nature as therefrom to get Most pitiful participation, yet The toil of Spirit—stronger far than this, And nobler much—receive of Him, that is Father of Spirits, no assistance meet, Even from the fugitive semblance of defeat Securing future triumph? . . . triumph miss'd By man in Adam, won for man in Christ! Which, tho', indeed, for all achieved by one, Must yet again by each be made his own, In his own fashion, after his own kind, Ere all possess the gain of each combined. Meanwhile, one man's life marks where life may reach. One ripple only touching on the beach, Thou say'st “The whole sea spreads thus far.” But one Of the chain's many links holds fast the stone The mason's engine lifts: yet say'st thou not “The whole chain's motion moves the stone?” I wot Thou hast much to learn, Ben Enoch. (He passes.) EUPHORBOS (after a pause). Come and gone Incredibly! and with announcement none, More than the sudden shadow on the grass Of a cloud passing. ZOZOMEN. Thou didst let him pass Too lightly. BEN ENOCH. There was that upon my mind, Whilst yet his eye was on me, I could find No answer to his speech. ZOZOMEN. Nor I. EUPHORBOS. Didst scan His face? BEN ENOCH I think it was no living man. I think it was Elias. EUPHORBOS. Could he speak Our language, Jew? For this man's speech was Greek. ZOZOMEN. What if it were—once more vouchsafed to us,— He of Tyana, that taught Ephesus Things inconceivable . . . since of his death No man is certain? EUPHORBOS. Such-like rumour saith The same of Heavenly John, whom Christus told How God to him had granted to behold, Whilst yet on Earth, the coming of the Day Of Renovation. For that man, some say, Is yet among us: and at sundry times, Of sundry folk, in many different climes, Hath certainly been seen. And whensoe'er The man hath shown himself at unaware, Great things have happen'd. Him I think it was That hath been with us, and is gone. Because Did he not name the man, or god, whom we From some of the new Jews have heard to be The founder of their sect,—bowing his head The while he spake? Moreover it doth spread, This sect, already, even amongst ourselves Who walk with Plato: even on mine own shelves I keep a book—'tis barbarous Greek, indeed,— About that selfsame Christus and his creed, Ascribed to this same John . . . BEN ENOCH and ZOZOMEN. We'll follow him. Went he this way? EUPHORBOS. No. Where the air is dim Deep in yon tamarisk thicket. BEN ENOCH. Would I knew What he would have us think he knows! ZOZOMEN. I too. EUPHORBOS. Hark! A DISTANT VOICE. Kai to pneuma kai hê nymphê . . . EUPHORBOS. There! THE VOICE. Legousin Elthe . . . ZOZOMEN. Yonder! where the air Is dim . . . THE VOICE. Kai ho akouon eipato Elthe! EUPHORBOS. That voice again! in tones, as tho' The man's hand beckon'd while his mystic hymn To us he chaunts. BEN ENOCH. Shall we not follow him? OMNES. Most certainly. ZOZOMEN. But if it be, indeed, Only a phantom which the air doth breed Not seldom, near the setting of the sun, Out of the womb of Eve—an eidolon That hath no substance save what it hath power To suck from mortal sense at this dim hour Which ushers in the night, . . . all search were vain. EUPHORBOS. And I am bidden . . . THE VOICE. Elthe! BEN ENOCH. Hark, again! EUPHORBOS. I cannot. Follow, you. I cannot. I Am bidden to the great festivity Which What's-his-name,—the new-made Consul's choice,— This very night . . . THE VOICE. Elthe! BEN ENOCH. Again that voice! ZOZOMEN. By Bacchus! I too must away. To night Myself am one of those his friends invite To hear our bran-new poet, Proteus, read His bran-new Epic . . . BEN ENOCH. And for me, indeed, Philemon, the Librarian, waits by this, To overlook that learnèd work of his Which crowns the labours of Ben Shittag, who Reform'd erewhile the Kabala,—a Jew Whom the Greek justly honours. Yet 'tis sad. I would have follow'd. EUPHORBOS. I too, if I had The time . . . ZOZOMEN. And I. BEN ENOCH. But weightier matters . . . EUPHORBOS. Then Farewell, Ben Enoch. Farewell, Zozomen. ZOZOMEN. Farewell, Euphorbos. Farewell worthy Jew. BEN ENOCH. And, gentle friends, a like farewell to you. (They disperse.) TIME (passing in the silence). Go, fools! It tasks a century's search to espy What oft a moment drops in passing by. END OF BOOK IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK V. LEGENDS AND ROMANCES. “We journey in the path of Parivaha.”—Sakoontalá. MOHAMMED. It is needless to mention that this has no foundation whatever in fact. It is told by Vanini in one of his Dialogues, “De admirandis Naturæ,” &amp;c., and there used by him, as here by me, without scruple, to serve a purpose by way of illustration. As regards Mohammed himself, it is a gross calumny. But, as regards every form of Religious Authority founded on fear of the Supernatural, whereof Mohammed is here the dramatic representative, it is no calumny, but, rather, the feeble illustration of a formidable fact. Mohammed, the divine, ere yet his name Blazed in the front of everlasting fame, Withdrew into the Desert, and abode Hard by Mount Hara, long alone with God. But from the solitude his soul swept forth And view'd the world,—east, west, and south, and north: Weakness without, and wickedness within: And how the people murmur'd, as in Zin, Yet lack'd the heavenly food; how, on each side, The Roman, and the Persian, in their pride, Were perishing from empire; how the Jew Defamed Jehovah; how the Christian crew, Wrangling around a desecrated Christ, Blacken'd the Light of God with smoke and mist Of idol-incense; how, in midst of this, Confusion crumbling down to the abyss, A void was, day by day, and hour by hour, Forming fit verge and scope for some new Power. And he perceived that every Power is good First,—since it comes from God, be it understood: But, after resting many years on earth, Power dwindles from the primal strength of birth, Grows weak, then gets confused, and, last, goes mad. So that it is the weakness that is bad, And not the potency, of creeds, and schools, And kings, and whatsoever reigns or rules. For, howsoe'er the ruler wield the rod, His right to rule is by the grace of God, Not the disgrace of man, which they that cause By wrongful rule, are rebels to God's laws. And, whilst he thought on this, and thought beside How nothing now was wanting to provide That novel Power which should regenerate Mankind, renew belief, and re-create Creation, but one bold man's active will, Mohammed's secret thoughts were troubled, till They made a darkness on his countenance. Then Amru timidly raised up his glance Upon the Prophet's face. Amru, his friend, Who, thro' those solitudes to watch and tend Upon him, stole from Mecca, when the light Was fading out, and, footing the deep night, At daybreak found him in the wilderness; And, all day long, beneath an intense stress Of silence, breathing low, was fain to lie, Just tolerated by the kingly eye Of his great friend, endeavouring to become Like a mere piece of the rock's self,—so dumb And gray, and motionless. Amru, at last Look'd up; and saw Mohammed's face o'ercast, And murmur'd “O Mohammed, art thou sad?” But still the Prophet seem'd as tho' he had Nor seen, nor heard, him. Amru then arose, And crept a little nearer, and sat close Against the skirting of his robe, and said “Mohammed, peace be with thee!” Still, his head Mohammed lifted not, nor answer'd aught. Then Amru said again “What is thy thought, Mohammed?” And Mohammed answer'd “Friend, A sad thought; which I think you will not mend. For first, I thought upon the mighty world Which lies beyond this wilderness, unfurl'd Like a great chart, to read in. And I saw How in all places the old power and law Are falling off. Again, I thought upon My Arabs in the ages coming on; The weakness, and the wickedness, of all The ancient races; our own strength; God's call; And all we might be, if we heard but that. But if, I thought, I tell this people what God, who speaks to me in the solitude, Hath bid me tell them, the loud rabble rude Will mock me, crying ‘Who made thee to be A teacher of us?’ If I answer ‘He Whose name is Very God, and God Alone, He, and none other,’ surely they will stone Or tear me. For tho' I, to prove the Lord Hath sent me to them, should proclaim His word, They will not heed it. Men were never wise (And never will be yet!) to recognize God, when He speaks by Law and Order: since In these there's nothing startling to convince The jaded sense of those that day by day See law and order working every way Around them,—yet in vain! And still God speaks Only by law and order; never breaks The old law even to fulfil the new. But men are ever eager, when they view Some seeming strange disorder, to exclaim ‘A god! a god!’ They think they hear God's name In thunder and in earthquake, but are deaf To the low lispings of the fallen leaf, And the soft hours. As tho' it were God's way To make man's mere bewilderment obey Some one of His immutably-fix'd laws By breaking of another,—for no cause Better than set agaping apes and fools— Ruling His world by riving his own rules! A worthy way! Sure am I, if anon Some mighty-mouthèd prodigy . . . yon stone, Say,—dumb as Pharaoh in his pyramid, Should suddenly find tongue, and, speaking, bid The hearers worship me,—or where, below There, like a mangled serpent trailing slow, The camel-path twists in and out the rocks, Yon sandy fissure, which the sly bitch-fox Would choose well for her yellow nursery, Gave forth a voice, to every passer by Proclaiming me the Appointed One, . . . they all Would straightway grovel at my feet, and call Heaven to attest how they believed,—each thief And liar vigorous in his vow'd belief! But 'twill not be.” After a little pause, “Why not?” said Amru. “Why not, friend? Because,” Mohammed answer'd, “Allah will not bring His heaven and earth together, just to wring Credence from creatures incapacious, slight, And void, as these. Nor, tho' his own hand write The wondrous warrant to this life of mine, Dare I so much as publish the divine Commission. Still the cautious earth and skies Keep close the secret. Let who will be wise. God shuts me in the hollow of His hand; Tho' in my heart I hear His stern command ‘Go forth, and preach.’” With petulant foot he spurn'd The sandy pebbles from him. Amru turn'd His forehead, bright with sudden bravery, up: And all his face flow'd over, as a cup Wherein wine mantles, with a noble thought. “And God doth well!” he answer'd, “tho' by nought, Mohammed, proved a mightier miracle (And, sure, God's gracious gift!) than is the spell Thou hast to sway to thine my inmost heart, Do I undoubtingly believe thou art The Man Appointed,—yet, indeed, for such As these, of whom thou speakest, needing much More gross and vulgar warrant for belief, —Incompetent to see in thee the Chief Of Prophets, by the dominant pale brow And eyes from which the sworded seraphs bow Their foreheads abasht,—O wherefore need God send A miracle more mighty than—a Friend, Who loves” . . . “A friend!” —“I say, what miracle Diviner than the heart that loveth well?” “So well?” Mohammed faulter'd. “Even so,” Said Amru, drooping faint his head, as tho' The effort to uplift that heavy weight Of his devoted passion proved too great, And dragg'd him down to earth. Mohammed sat Gasping against the silence: staring at The man before him, with a smould'ring eye: Whilst his hand shut and open'd silently, As tho' the Fiend's black forelock, slipping thro' His feverish clutch, just foil'd him: and the hue Waned into whiteness on his swarthy cheek. Then Amru, when Mohammed would not speak, Lifted his looks, and gazed, as tho' in doubt Of what strange thing the silence was about. And Amru said “Mohammed, let thy slave Find favour in thy sight!—albeit, I have No wit in counsel. Get thee privily Again to Mecca. Leave this night to me. To-morrow, stand up in the marketplace And plead against the people, face to face, And call them hither; prophesying they By sign and miracle along the way Shall know The Man Appointed. I, meanwhile, Will creep into yon crevice . . . Ha! dost smile, Mohammed? Dost approve the thing I mean? —Will creep into yon crevice, and, unseen, Await the multitude,—which must come by, Thou guiding. Unto whom a voice shall cry ‘This is Mohammed! I, the Lord of Heaven, Make known to all this people, I have given To him to preach My Law,—that he may be My Prophet, to all nations under Me.’ —Smile! smile again, Mohammed! . . . Only smile Less terribly upon me! . . . Of the vile The vilest,—yet thy servant, Aweful One! Less terribly, Mohammed! . . “Then, anon When all the place is silent—the crowd far— Far out of sight—and nothing but yon star To witness,—I will steal out of the cave.” . . . “Hah!” . . . “—O Mohammed, am I not thy slave? Look not so fiercely on me! . . . And far off Follow the silly people. Who will scoff? Who will misdoubt thee then? . . . Mohammed, speak!” Mohammed spake not. All the Prophet's cheek Was wan with whirling thoughts that o'er it cast Their troubled shades, and left it calm at last, As battle fields,—when battles have been won, Or lost, and dawn breaks slowly. “Be it, my son, As thou hast spoken. This is God's command.” He wearily sigh'd, and laid a heavy hand On Amru's shoulder. “I to Mecca go This night. At dawn, as thou hast said, so do.” And all night long, over the silent sand, Under the silent stars, across the land Mohammed fled: as tho' he heard the feet Of Iblis following, and a voice repeat Close at his ear, monotonous and slow, “Thou wouldst have had this man trust thee. But now, Mohammed, thou thyself must trust to him.” And the voice ceased not; nor the feet; till, dim At first, then flaring in a stormy sky, The drear dawn lighten'd o'er him angrily. That day he stood up in the market-place, And pleaded with the people face to face; Pouring from urns of solitary thought A piercing eloquence upon them, brought, Word after word, by wondrous Spirits from far, Shrill with the music of the morning star, Weighty with thunder. Some averr'd they saw The light that lighted Moses, when the Law On Sinai from God's finger he received, Enhalo all his brow. The noon achieved The dawn's desire. They followed him by flocks Far thro' the Desert to the rifted rocks. And, ever as they journey'd, in their van A thunder cloud, that, since the day began, Had labour'd to demolish half the sky, Travell'd to reach Mount Hara, and there die. And still the people follow'd: and, beside The mountain halting, heard a voice which cried (Out of a rocky fissure, the ground story Of some wild coney's dismal dormitory) “This is Mohammed! I, the Lord of Heaven, Proclaim to all this people, I have given To him to preach My Law, that he may be My Prophet, to all nations under Me.” And, as the voice ceased, suddenly a streak Of fork'd fire flicker'd from a riven creek In the spent cloud, which, splitting overhead Bellow'd. And all the people cried, and said “The Voice of God!” And then did each man fall Flat at the Prophet's feet, and, grovelling, call On Heaven's Appointed. “Speak, Mohammed! speak!” Mohammed spake not. All the Prophet's cheek Was white with pain, as warring angels pass'd Across his trampled soul—left bare at last As battle fields,—when battles have been won, Or lost, and dawn breaks slowly. Blocks of stone, Tumbled by ages in the rifted sand, Burn'd white about the lion-colour'd land, And, beaten by a blinding sunlight, made Blots, in a level glare, of sprinkled shade. Mohammed stretch'd his hand. Not Moses' rod Won easier reverence. “Ay! the Voice of God Hath spoken, not to be misunderstood, This day unto us. Wherefore, it seems good To build, O friends, an altar to The Lord Here on the spot from whence the wondrous Word Hath issued. And see! Nature, warn'd before Of this forecast event, hath furnish'd store Of stone to build with. Never from this day Be it averr'd that any beast of prey Or reptile base hath been allow'd to dwell Where God first housed His Holy Oracle! Cram every crevice of this mountain flaw: Leave not a loophole for the leopard's paw, A cranny that a mouse might wriggle thro'! If anything unclean hath crept into This Mouth of Earth where Heaven's high Voice abode Erewhile, O friends,—worm, adder, viper, toad, There let it perish 'neath a costlier tomb Than ever reptile own'd! Seal up the womb Of this dread prodigy. Hark! from you cloud Above us, Spirits of the thunder, bow'd To watch, grow wild, impatient to be gone. Begin the work. Pile strong with ponderous stone The altar. Bear ye each his burthen . . . Nay, None but myself the first firm stone shall lay Unto this sacred fabric!” . . . Then himself, Fiercely dislodging from its sandy shelf A mighty mountain fragment, roll'd, with might And main, the rock-surrender'd offering right Against the cave. And turn'd himself about And hid his face. In prayer, as who shall doubt? And, when the people heard this, they were glad Exceedingly: not only to have had No heavier task enjoin'd them, but because If any man profane had dared to pause And doubt till then, he, certes, had no choice But to believe henceforth. For, if the voice Were nothing more than human, the command Was something less. Could mere Ambition stand Thus calmly contemplating, stone by stone, The immurement of some creature of its own? And so they hearten'd to the work, until The rocky altar rose against the hill; And then Mohammed blest it. And that day, Upon that altar, Providence, they say, Founded a new Religion. Which, thus reared In the lone Desert, spread, and soon ensphered The quadripartite globe. But, from that day, Mohammed went no more alone to pray On Hara, as his wont had been before. For him, the sweet of solitude was o'er. THE ROSES OF SAADI. I.MOSES AND THE DERVISH. God, that heaven's seven climates hath spread forth, To every creature, even as is the worth, The lot apportions, and the use of things. If to the creeping cat were given wings, No sparrow's egg would ever be a bird. Moses the Prophet, who with God conferr'd, Beheld a Dervish, that, for dire distress And lack of clothes to hide his nakedness, Buried his body in the desert sand. This Dervish cried “O Moses, whom the Hand Of the Most High God favours! make thy prayer That He may grant me food and clothes to wear Who knows the misery of me, and the need.” Then Moses pray'd to God, that He would feed And clothe that Dervish. Nine days after this, Returning from Mount Sinai in bliss, Having beheld God's face, the Prophet met The Dervish in the hands of Justice, set Between two officers; and, all about, The rabble follow'd him with hoot, and shout, And jeer. The Prophet ask'd of those that cried “What hath befallen this man?” And they replied “He hath drunk wine, and, having slain a man, Is going to the death.” Moses began To praise the Maker of the Universe, Seeing that his prayer, tho' granted, proved perverse, Since God to every living soul sets forth The circumstance according to the worth. II.THE BOY AND THE RING. Fair chance, held fast, is merit. A certain king Of Persia had a jewel in a ring. He set it on the dome of Azud high; And, when they saw it flashing in the sky, Made proclamation to his royal troop, That whoso sent an arrow thro' the hoop That held the gem, should have the ring to wear. It chanced there were four hundred archers near, Of the king's company, about the king. Each took his aim, and shot, and miss'd the ring. A boy, at play upon the terraced roof Of a near building, bent his bow aloof At random, and behold! the morning breeze His little arrow caught, and bore with ease Right thro' the circlet of the gem. The king, Well-pleased, unto the boy assign'd the ring. Then the boy burnt his arrows and his bow. The king, astonish'd, said “Why dost thou so, Seeing thy first shot hath had great success?” He answer'd “Lest my second make that less.” III.THE EYES OF MAHMUD. Sultàn Mahmùd, son of Sabaktogin, Swept with his sceptre the hot sands of Zin, Spread forth his mantle over Palestine, And made the carpet of his glory shine From Cufah to Cashmere; and, in his pride Said “All these lands are mine.” At last he died. Then his sons laid him with exceeding state In a deep tomb. Upon the granite gate Outside they graved in gold his titles all, And all the names of kingdoms in his thrall, And all his glory. And beside his head They placed a bag of rice, a loaf of bread, And water in a pitcher. This they did In order that, if God should haply bid His servant Death to let this sultan go Because of his surpassing greatness, so He might not come back hungry. But he lay In his high marble coffin night and day Motionless, without majesty or will. Darkness sat down beside him, and was still. Afterwards, when a hundred years had roll'd, A certain king, desiring to behold This famous sultan, gave command to unlock The granite gate of that sepulchral rock, And, with a lamp, went down into the tomb, And all his court. Out of the nether gloom There rose a loathsome stench intolerable. Hard by the marble coffin, on a sill Of mildew'd stone the earthen pitcher stood, Untouch'd, untasted. Rats, a ravenous brood, Had scatter'd all the rice, and gnaw'd the bread. All that was left upon his marble bed Of the great Sultan was a little heap Of yellow bones, and a dry skull, with deep Eye-sockets. But in those eye-sockets, lo! Two living eyes were rolling to and fro, Now left, now right, with never any rest. Then was the king amazed, and smote his breast And call'd on God for grace. But not the less Those dismal eyes with dreadful restlessness Continually in their socket-holes Roll'd right and left, like pain'd and wicked souls. Then said the king “Call here an Abid, wise And righteous, to rebuke those wicked eyes That will not rest.” And when the Abid came The king said “O mine Abid, in the name Of the High God that judges quick and dead, Speak to those eyes.” The Abid, trembling, said “Eyes of Mahmud, why is your rest denied In death? What seek ye here?” The eyes replied, Still rolling in their wither'd sockets there, “God's curse upon this darkness! Where, O where Be my possessions? For with fierce endeavour Ever we seek them, but can find them never.” THE APPLE OF LIFE. From the river Euphrates, the river whose source is in Paradise, far As red Egypt,—sole lord of the land and the sea, 'twixt the eremite star Of the orient desert's lone dawn, and the porch of the chambers of rest Where the great sea is girded with fire, and Orion returns in the West, And the ships come and go in grand silence,—King Solomon reign'd. And behold, In that time there was everywhere silver as common as stones be, and gold That for plenty was 'counted as silver, and cedar as sycamore trees That are found in the vale, for abundance. For God to the King gave all these, With glory exceeding; moreover all kings of the earth to him came, Because of his wisdom, to hear him. So great was King Solomon's fame. And for all this the King's soul was sad. And his heart said within him, “Alas, “For man dies! if his glory abideth, himself from his glory shall pass. And that which remaineth behind him, he seeth it not any more: For how shall he know what comes after, who knoweth not what went before? I have planted me gardens and vineyards, and gotten me silver and gold, And my hand from whatever my heart hath desired I did not withhold: And what profit have I in the works of my hands which I take not away? I have searchèd out wisdom and knowledge: and what do they profit me, they? As the fool dieth, so doth the wise. What is gather'd is scatter'd again. As the breath of the beasts, even so is the breath of the children of men: And the same thing befalleth them both. And not any man's soul is his own.” This he thought, as he sat in his garden, and watch'd the great sun going down In the glory thereof; and the earth and the sky, in that glory, became Clothed clear with the gladness of colour, and bathed in the beauty of flame. And “Behold,” said the King, “in a moment the glory shall vanish!” Even then, While he spake, he was 'ware of a man drawing near him, who seem'd to his ken (By the hair in its blackness like flax that is burn'd in the hemp-dresser's shed, And the brow's smoky hue, and the smouldering eyeball more livid than lead) As the sons of the land that lies under the sword of the Cherub whose wing Wraps in wrath the shut gateways of Paradise. He, being come to the King, Seven times made obeisance before him. To whom, “What art thou,” the King cried, “That thus unannounced to King Solomon comest?” The man, spreading wide The palm of his right hand, show'd in it an apple yet bright from the Tree In whose stem springs the life never-failing which Sin lost to Adam, when he, Tasting knowledge forbidden, found death in the fruit of it . . . So doth the Giver Evil gifts to the evil apportion. And “Hail! let the King live for ever!” Bowing down at the feet of the monarch, and laughingly, even as one Whose meaning, in joy or in jest, hovers hid 'twixt the word and the tone, Said the stranger (as lightly the apple he dropp'd in the hand of the King), “For lo ye! from 'twixt the four rivers of Eden, God gave me to bring To his servant King Solomon, even to my lord that on Israel's throne He hath 'stablisht, this fruit from the Tree in whose branch Life abideth: for none Shall taste death, having tasted this apple.” And therewith he vanish'd. Remain'd In the hand of the King the life-apple: ambrosial of breath, golden-grain'd, Rosy-bright as a star dipt in sunset. The King turn'd it o'er, and perused The fruit, which, alluring his lip, in his hand lay untasted. He mused, “Life is good: but not life in itself. Life eternal, eternally young, That were life to be lived, or desired! Well it were if a man could prolong The manhood that moves in the muscles, the rapture that mounts in the brain When life at the prime, in the pastime of living, led on by the train Of the jubilant senses, exulting goes forth, brave of body and spirit, To conquer, choose, claim, and enjoy what 'twas born to achieve or inherit. The dance, and the festal procession! the pride in the strenuous play Of the sinews that, eager for service, the will, tho' it wanton, obey! When in veins lightly flowing, the fertile and bountiful impulses beat, When the dews of the dawn of Desire on the roses of Beauty are sweet: And the eye glows with glances that kindle, the lip breathes the warmth that inspires, And the hand hath yet vigour to seize the good thing which the spirit desires! O well for the foot that bounds forward! and ever the wind it awakes Lifts no lock from the forehead yet white, not a leaf that is wither'd yet shakes From the loose flowers wreathing young tresses! and ever the earth and the skies Abound in rich ardours, rejoicings, and raptures of endless surprise! Life is sweet to the young that yet know not what life is. But life, after Youth, The gay liar, leaves hold of the bauble, and Age, with his terrible truth, Picks it up, and perceives it is broken, and knows it unfit to engage The care it yet craves . . . . Life eternal, eternally wedded to Age! What gain were in that? Why should any man seek what he loathes to prolong? The twilight that darkens the eyeball: the dull ear that's deaf to the song, When the maidens rejoice and the bride to the bridegroom, with music, is led: The palsy that shakes 'neath the blossoms that fall from the chill bridal bed. When the hand saith ‘I did,’ not ‘I will do,’ the heart saith ‘It was,’ not ‘'Twill be,’ Too late in man's life is Forever—too late comes this apple to me!” Then the King rose. And lo, it was evening. And leaning, because he was old, On the sceptre that, curiously sculptured in ivory garnish'd with gold, To others a rod of dominion, to him was a staff for support, Slow paced he the murmurous pathways where myrtles, in court up to court, Mixt with roses in garden on garden, were ranged around fountains that fed With cool music green odorous twilights: and so, never lifting his head To look up from the way he walk'd wearily, he to the House of his Pride Reascended, and enter'd. In cluster, high lamps, spices, odours, each side, Burning inward and onward, from cinnamon ceilings, down distances vast Of voluptuous vistas, illumined deep halls thro' whose silentness pass'd King Solomon sighing; where columns colossal stood, gather'd in groves As the trees of the forest in Libanus,—there where the wind, as it moves, Whispers “I, too, am Solomon's servant!”—huge trunks hid in garlands of gold, On whose tops the skill'd sculptors of Sidon had granted men's gaze to behold How the phœnix that sits on the cedar's lone summit 'mid fragrance and fire, Ever dying and living, hath loaded with splendours her funeral pyre; How the stork builds her nest on the pine-top; the date from the palm-branch depends; And the shaft of the blossoming aloe soars crowning the life which it ends. And from hall on to hall, in the doors, mute, magnificent slaves, watchful-eyed, Bow'd to earth as King Solomon pass'd them. And, passing, King Solomon sigh'd. And, from hall on to hall pacing feebly, the king mused . . . “O fair Shulamite! “Thy beauty is brighter than starlight on Hebron when Hebron is bright, Thy sweetness is sweeter than Carmel. The King rules the nations; but thou, Thou rulest the King, my Belovèd.” So murmur'd King Solomon low To himself, as he pass'd thro' the portal of porphyry, that dripp'd, as he pass'd, From the myrrh-sprinkled wreaths on the locks and the lintels; and enter'd at last, Still sighing, the sweet cedarn chamber, contrived for repose and delight, Where the beautiful Shulamite slumber'd. And straightway, to left and to right, Bowing down as he enter'd, the Spirits in bondage to Solomon, there Keeping watch o'er his love, sank their swords, spread their wings, and evanish'd in air. The King with a kiss woke the sleeper. And, showing the fruit in his hand, “Behold! this was brought me erewhile by one coming,” he said, “from the land That lies under the sword of the Cherub. 'Twas pluckt by strange hands from the Tree Of whose fruit whoso tasteth shall die not. And therefore I bring it to thee, My belovèd. For thou of the daughters of women art fairest. And lo, I, the King, I that love thee, whom men of man's sons have call'd wisest, I know That in knowledge is sorrow. Much thought is much care. In the beauty of youth, Not the wisdom of age, is enjoyment. Nor spring, is it sweeter, in truth, Than winter, to roses once wither'd. The garment, tho' broider'd with gold, Fades apace where the moth frets the fibres. So I, in my glory, grow old. And this life maketh mine (save the bliss of my soul in the beauty of thee) No sweetness so great now that greatly unsweet 'twere to lose what to me Life prolong'd, at its utmost, can promise. But thine, O thou spirit of bliss, Thine is all that the living desire,—youth, beauty, love, joy in all this! And O were it not well for the praise of the world to maintain evermore This mould of a woman, God's masterwork, made for mankind to adore? Wherefore keep thou the gift I resign. Live for ever, rejoicing in life! And of women unborn yet the fairest shall still be King Solomon's wife.” So he said, and so dropp'd in her bosom the apple. But when he was gone, And the beautiful Shulamite, eyeing the gift of the King, sat alone With the thoughts the King's words had awaken'd, as ever she turn'd and perused The fruit that, alluring her lip, in her hand lay untasted—she mused, “Life is good; but not life in itself. So is youth, so is beauty. Mere stuff Are all these for Love's usance. To live, it is well; but it is not enough. Well, too, to be fair, to be young; but what good is in beauty and youth If the lovely and young are not surer than they that be neither, forsooth, Young nor lovely, of being beloved? O my love, if thou lovest not me, Shall I love my own life? Am I fair, if not fair, Azariah, to thee?” Then she hid in her bosom the apple. And rose. And, reversing the ring That, inscribed with the word that works wonders, and sign'd with the seal of the King, Hath o'er spirits and demons dominion—(for she, for a plaything, erewhile From King Solomon's awful forefinger, had won it away with a smile)— The beautiful Shulamite folded her veil o'er her forehead and eyes, And, with footsteps that fleeted as silent and swift as a bird's shadow flies, Unseen from the palace, she pass'd, and pass'd down to the city unseen, Unseen pass'd the green garden wicket, the vineyard, the cypresses green, And stood by the doors of the house of the Prince Azariah. And cried, In the darkness she cried—“Azariah, awaken! ope, ope to me wide! “Ope the door, ope the lattice! Arise! Let me in, O my love! It is I. Thee, the bride of King Solomon, loveth. Love, tarry not. Love, shall I die At thy doors? I am sick of desire. For my love is more comely than gold. More precious to me is my love than the throne of a king that is old. Behold, I have pass'd thro' the city, unseen of the watchmen. I stand By the doors of the house of my love, till my love lead me in by the hand.” Azariah arose. And unbolted the door to the fair Shulamite. “O my queen, what dear folly is this, that hath led thee alone, and by night, To the house of King Solomon's servant? For lo you, the watchmen awake. And much for my own, O my queen, must I fear, and much more for thy sake. For at that which is done in the chamber the leek on the housetop shall peep: And the hand of a king it is heavy: the eyes of a king never sleep: But the bird of the air beareth news to the king, and the stars of the sky Are as soldiers by night on the turrets. I fear, O my queen, lest we die.” “Fear thou not, O my love! Azariah fear nothing. For lo, what I bring! 'Tis the fruit of the Tree that in Paradise God hideth under the wing Of the Cherub that chased away Adam. And whoso this apple doth eat Shall live—live for ever! And since unto me my own life is less sweet Than thy love, Azariah (sweet only thy love maketh life unto me!), Therefore eat! Live, and love, for life's sake, still, the love that gives life unto thee!” Then she held to his lips the life-apple, and kiss'd him. But soon as alone, Azariah lean'd out from his lattice, he mutter'd “'Tis well! She is gone.” While the fruit in his hand lay untasted. “Such visits,” he mused, “may cost dear. “In the love of the great is great danger, much trouble, and care more than cheer.” Then he laugh'd, and stretch'd forth his strong arms. For he heard from the streets of the city The song of the women that sing in the doors after dark their love ditty. And the clink of the wine-cup, the voice of the wanton, the tripping of feet, And the laughter of youths running after, allured him. And “Life, it is sweet “While it lasts,” sang the women, “and sweeter the good minute, in that it goes, For who, if the rose bloom'd for ever, so greatly would care for the rose? Wherefore haste! pluck the time in the blossom.” The prince mused, “The counsel is well.” And the fruit to his lips he uplifted: yet paused. “Who is he that can tell “What his days shall bring forth? Life for ever . . . But what sort of life? Ah, the doubt!” 'Neath his cloak then he thrust back the apple. And open'd the door and pass'd out To the house of the harlot Egyptian. And mused, as he went, “Life is good: “But not life in itself. It is well while the wine-cup is hot in the blood, And a man goeth whither he listeth, and doeth the thing that he will, And liveth his life as he lusteth, and taketh in freedom his fill Of the pleasure that pleaseth his humour, and feareth no snare by the way. Shall I care to be loved by a queen, if my pride with my freedom I pay? Better far is a handful in quiet than both hands, tho' fill'd to overflow With pride, in vexation of spirit. And sweeter the roses that blow From the wild seeds the wind, where he wanders, with heedless beneficence flings, Than those that are guarded by dragons to brighten the gardens of kings. Let a man take his chance, and be happy. The hart, tho' hard press'd by the hounds When the horn of the hunter hath scatter'd the herd from the hills where it sounds, Is more to be envied, tho' Death with his dart follow fast to destroy, Than the tame beast that, pent in the paddock, tastes neither the danger nor joy Of the mountain, and all its surprises. The main thing is, not to live long, But to live. Better moments of rapture soon ended than ages of wrong. Life's feast is best spiced by the flavour of death in it. Just the one chance To lose it to-morrow the life that a man lives to-day doth enhance. The may-be for me, not the must-be! Best flourish while flourish the flowers, And fall ere the frost falls. The dead, do they rest or arise with new powers? Either way, well for them. Mine, meanwhile, be the cup of life's fulness to-night. And to-morrow . . . Well, time to consider” (he felt at the fruit): “What delight Of his birthright had Esau, when hungry? To-day with its pottage is sweet. For a man cannot feed and be full on the faith of to-morrow's baked meat. Open! open, my dark-eyed beguiler of darkness!” Up rose to his knock, Light of foot, the lascivious Egyptian, and lifted the latch from the lock, And open'd. And led in the prince to her chamber, and shook out her hair, Dark, heavy, and humid with odours; her bosom beneath it laid bare, And sleek sallow shoulder; and sloped back her face, as, when falls the slant South In wet whispers of rain, flowers bend back to catch it; so she, with shut mouth Half-unfolding for kisses; and sank, as they fell, 'twixt his knees, with a laugh, On the floor, in a flood of deep hair flung behind her full throat; held him half Aloof with one large languid arm, while the other up-propp'd, where she lay, Limbs flowing in fulness and lucid in surface as waters at play, Tho' in firmness as slippery marble. Anon she sprang loose from his clasp, And whirl'd from the table a flagon of silver twined round by an asp That glitter'd,—rough gold and red rubies; and pour'd him, and praised him, the wine Wherewith she first brighten'd the moist lip that murmur'd, “Ha, fool! art thou mine? “I am thine. This will last for an hour.” Then, humming strange words of a song, Sung by maidens in Memphis the old, when they bore the Crown'd Image along, Apples yellow and red from a basket with vine-leaves o'erlaid she 'gan take, And play'd with, peel'd, tost them, and caught them, and bit them, for idleness' sake; But the rinds on the floor she flung from her, and laugh'd at the figures they made, As her foot pusht them this way and that way together. And, “Look, fool,” she said, “It is all sour fruit, this! But those I fling from me,—see here by the stain!— Shall carry the mark of my teeth in their flesh. Could they feel but the pain, O my soul, how these teeth should go through them! Fool, fool, what good gift dost thou bring? For thee have I sweeten'd with cassia my chambers.” “A gift for a king,” Azariah laugh'd loud; and tost to her the apple. “This comes from the Tree “Of whose fruit whoso tastes lives for ever. I care not. I give it to thee. Nay, witch! 'tis worth more than the shekels of gold thou hast charm'd from my purse. Take it. Eat. Life is sweeter than knowledge: and Eve, thy sly mother, fared worse, O thou white-toothèd taster of apples!” “Thou liest, fool?” “Taste, then, and try. For the truth of the fruit's in the eating. 'Tis thou art the serpent, not I.” And the strong man laugh'd loud as he push'd at her lip the life-apple. She caught And held it away from her, musing; and mutter'd . . . “Go to! It is nought. “Fool, why dost thou laugh?” And he answer'd, “Because, witch, it tickles my brain “Intensely to think that all we, that be Something while yet we remain, We, the princes of people—ay, even the King's self—shall die in our day, And thou, that art Nothing, shall sit on our graves, with our grandsons, and play.” So he said, and laugh'd louder. But when, in the grey of the dawn, he was gone, And the wan light wax'd large in the window, as she on her bed sat alone, With the fruit that, alluring her lip, in her hand lay untasted, perusing, Perplext, the gay gift of the Prince, the dark woman thereat fell a musing, And she thought . . . “What is Life without Honour? And what can the life that I live “Give to me, I shall care to continue, not caring for aught it can give? I, despising the fools that despise me—a plaything not pleasing myself— Whose life, for the pelf that maintains it, must sell what is paid not by pelf! I? . . . the man call'd me Nothing. He said well. ‘The great in their glory must go.’ And why should I linger, whose life leadeth nowhere?—a life which I know To name is to shame—struck, unsexed, by the world from its list of the lives Of the women whose womanhood, saved, gets them leave to be mothers and wives. And the fancies of men change. And bitterly bought is the bread that I eat; For, tho' purchased with body and spirit, when purchased 'tis yet all unsweet.” Her tears fell: they fell on the apple. She sigh'd . . . “Sour fruit, like the rest! “Let it go with the salt tears upon it. Yet life . . . it were sweet if possess'd In the power thereof, and the beauty. ‘A gift for a king’ . . . did he say? Ay, a king's life is life as it should be—a life like the light of the day, Wherein all that liveth rejoiceth. For is not the King as the sun That shineth in heaven and seemeth both heaven and itself all in one? Then to whom may this fruit, the life-giver, be worthily given? Not me. Nor the fool Azariah that sold it for folly. The King! only he,— Only he hath the life that's worth living for ever. Whose life, not alone Is the life of the King, but the life of the many made mighty in one. To the King will I carry this apple. And he (for the hand of a king Is a fountain of hope) in his handmaid shall honour the gift that I bring. And men for this deed shall esteem me, with Rahab by Israel praised, As first among those who, tho' lowly, their shame into honour have raised: Such honour as lasts when life goes, and, while life lasts, shall lift it above What, if loved by the many I loathe, must be loathed by the few I could love.” So she rose, and went forth thro' the city. And with her the apple she bore In her bosom: and stood 'mid the multitude, waiting therewith in the door Of the hall where the King, to give judgment, ascended at morning his throne: And, kneeling there, cried, “Let the King live for ever! Behold, I am one “Whom the vile of themselves count the vilest. But great is the grace of my lord. And now let my lord on his handmaid look down, and give ear to her word.” Thereat, in the witness of all, she drew forth, and (uplifting her head) Show'd the Apple of Life, which who tastes, tastes not death. “And this apple,” she said, “Last night was deliver'd to me, that thy servant should eat, and not die. But I said to the soul of thy servant, ‘Not so. For behold, what am I? That the King, in his glory and gladness, should cease from the light of the sun, Whiles I, that am least of his slaves, in my shame and abasement live on.’ For not sweet is the life of thy servant, unless to thy servant my lord Stretch his hand, and show favour. For surely the frown of a king is a sword, But the smile of the King is as honey that flows from the clefts of the rock, And his grace is as dew that from Horeb descends on the heads of the flock: In the King is the heart of a host: the King's strength is an army of men: And the wrath of the King is a lion that roareth by night from his den: But as grapes from the vines of En-Gedi are favours that fall from his hands, And as towers on the hill-tops of Shenir the throne of King Solomon stands. And for this, it were well that for ever the King, who is many in one, Should sit, to be seen thro' all time, on a throne 'twixt the moon and the sun! For how shall one lose what he hath not? Who hath, let him keep what he hath. Wherefore I to the King give this apple.” Then great was King Solomon's wrath. And he rose, rent his garment, and cried, “Woman, whence came this apple to thee?” But when he was 'ware of the truth, then his heart was awaken'd. And he Knew at once that the man who, erewhile, unawares coming to him, had brought That Apple of Life was, indeed, God's good Angel of Death. And he thought “In mercy, I doubt not, when man's eyes were open'd and made to see plain All the wrong in himself, and the wretchedness, God sent to close them again For man's sake, his last friend upon earth—Death, the servant of God, who is just. Let man's spirit to Him whence it cometh return, and his dust to the dust!” Then the Apple of Life did King Solomon seal in an urn that was sign'd With the seal of Oblivion: and summon'd the Spirits that walk in the wind Unseen on the summits of mountains, where never the eagle yet flew; And these he commanded to bear far away,—out of reach, out of view, Out of hope, out of memory,—higher than Ararat buildeth his throne, In the Urn of Oblivion the Apple of Life. But on green jaspar-stone Did the King write the story thereof for instruction. And Enoch, the seer, Coming afterward, search'd out the meaning. And he that hath ears, let him hear.</field>

Nicetas. THE SIEGE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. A CHRONICLE OF THE FALL OF THE GREEK EMPIRE. IN FOUR PARTS. PART I. “La vint al Comte, si comme dit Vn Danziaus, ki ioenes estoit A qui toute Gresse appendoit, Par son Oncle ies deseritès Et de chastiaus &amp; de citès. Alexis ot nom, mult fu biaus, Bien enseniés iere le Danziaus: Conté li a tot son afaire, Et li Quens ki bien li vot faire, Li fist jurer le sairement, Kil en iroit tout voirement A quan qu'il poroit outremer Auec lui s'il puet recouurer Sa tierre, &amp; tant faire li sache Que couronne porter li face.”—Philippes Mouskes. I.THE EMPEROR ISAAC. In gold Byzantium, girt with purple seas, Isaac is Emperor, and reigns at ease. For, if he smiles, a swarm of gilded slaves Smiles also, grateful for the grace that saves Their fortunes one day longer: if he frowns, Spears sparkle on the walls of frighten'd towns, And half the East is darken'd: if he sleeps, The soul of Music o'er his slumber keeps Melodious vigil, and, down lucid floors Of marble chambers vast, at sighing doors Dusk faces watch, while long-hair'd large-eyed girls Crouch at his pillow fringed with dropping pearls. Proud to up-prop his throne, four lions—four Large bulks of blazing gold—crook evermore Their wrinkled backs. For him the murex dies In Tyrrhene nets. For him, 'neath golden skies, In gorgeous cluster, all those glittering isles That circle Delos, where the sun first smiles, Broider the sea's blue breast with beauty rare. For him, thro' valleys cool'd with shadowy air, The Phrygian shepherd leads his numerous flocks. His are the towers on Helespontine rocks, And his the hill-built citadels that crown Morean bays, by many a mountain town. For him, from antique Thessaly's witch-lands Sweet sorceries breathe. For him, the hardy bands Of snowy Thrace, a multitude of spears, March with the Macedonian mountaineers. From strong Durazzo's battlemented steep To sultry Tarsus, and Malmistra, sweep His glowing realms; and to his sway respond All Anatolia's tribes, from Trebezond Far as the Syrian Gates. His standards float And flash athwart Pamphylian shores remote, Throng all Meander's many-winding stream, And in blue Asian weather blaze supreme From ancient cities, proud and populous, O'ertopping temples white in Ephesus, Sardes, and Smyrna, and among the groves The swarthy-faced Laödicean loves, Or where, in Philadelphia's teeming squares, The turban'd trader spreads his silken wares. The glories of old Rome, by all the line Of Latin Cæsars left to Constantine, Blaze in his eyes, to make him glad and great. Red Asia doth green Europe emulate Which with most lavish hand shall treasures heap Within his palace gates. All sails, that sweep The waters of the world and every shore, Meet in his harbours. Princely Pages pour For him the Chian and the Lesbian wine In agate cups and vases crystalline, Wrought first in Rome, when thro' the Triumph Gate Pompeïus came from conquering Mithridate. For him, on gems and jasper stones is writ The Arab wisdom, and the Persic wit. For him, Greek Monks, in Thracian convents cold, Guard Homer's songs on parchments graved with gold. To nourish this one man a million starve: And on his tables kingborn butlers carve The quadripartite globe: earth, sea, and air, Are devastated for his daily fare. To serve him, twice ten thousand eunuchs stand, Who start, if he but nod, or wave his hand. Daily, his Prophet, whom for smiling views He pays with Patriarchal revenues, Prophesies to him of ease, pleasantness, And length of days, glory, and great success, And realms extended from Euphrates far As where the Lebanonian cedars are. The grandeur of the East and of the West Glows in his galleries. He is potent, blest, Supreme. He hath two bloodhounds in a leash, Terror, and Force: two slaves that serve his wish, Pleasure, and Pomp. II.IS SAD. Yet, in despite of all, The Emperor Isaac sits in his vast hall An undelighted man. To him all meat Is tasteless, and all sweetnesses unsweet: To him all beauty is unbeautiful, All pleasures without pleasantness, and dull Each day's delights. His women and his wine Nauseate the sense they sate not. His lamps shine In cedarn chambers, ceil'd with gold, as gleam Corpse-lights in charnels. Music's strenuous stream Of pining sounds makes passionatest pain About his joyless heart, and jaded brain. So harsh an echo in the hollowness Within him dwells, that echo to suppress He, if he could, would make the whole world mute. He curses both the fluteplayer and the flute: He strikes both lyre and lyrist to the ground: The silence is less tolerable than sound. For men's praise undeserved, the pain assign'd To this praised man is scorn of all mankind. To please him, Age its reverend form foregoes, And wrinkled panders for his public shows Invent new vices. At his least of looks Manhood forsakes its manliness, and crooks Beneath a truculent foot a slavish neck. White-fronted Womanhood, if he but beck, Wallows in shame, unshamed: while Youth, to charm His fancy all the Virtues doth disarm, Disgracing all the Graces. And, for this, He hates Man, Woman, Youth, and Age. No bliss In youthfulness, no dignity in years, Men to this man, by men adored, endears: Because his greatness, being of a kind That grows from all men's littleness combined, Dwells self-condemn'd among the multitude Of voices lifted to proclaim it good, And tongues that lick the dust, and knees that fall, And backs that cringe before its pedestal. Him all these immense means to make him glad, Misused immensely, make immensely sad. III.AND SO IS HIS BROTHER ALEXIUS: WHO PROPOSES Beside the Emperor sits the Emperor's brother: Companions, one as joyless as the other, And soul-distemper'd both:—the first, with what He hath; the second, that he hath it not. So, turning to Alexius, with dull eyes By dull eyes met, Isaac the Emperor sighs “How things desired, and had, desire destroy! How hard it is, enjoyment to enjoy! Advise us, Brother, how may Pleasure borrow Some new disguise to fool the querulous Morrow From his foreseen reproval of Today?” Whereto Alexius, “I have oft heard say That more wild beasts than men be left in Thrace. Wherefore” . . . “The chase!” the Emperor cries, “the chase? A happy thought! Such sleep as nightly flies The silken couch where Ease, uneasy, lies, Perchance kind Nature charitably drops On wearied limbs from perilous mountain tops. And ancient poets say that pure Content Was never yet in crowded city pent. She, with young Health, her hardy child, they say After the shadows of the clouds doth stray, Or near the nibbling flocks by grassy dells, And, bee-like, feeds at eve in myrtle bells On little drops of dew, deliciously As the fair Queen of Fays. I know not, I, If that be true: but this I know full well, That not in any palace where I dwell, —Neither beneath Blachernæ's sculptured roofs, Nor in Boucoleon, where my horses' hoofs, Shod with red gold, strike echoes musical From porphyry pavements in a silver stall,— This Phantom hath her haunt. We'll try the woods, Wild-water'd glens, and savage solitudes; And, if she hide with Echo in her cave, We'll rouse her; if with Naiads in the wave, We'll plunge to find her; tho' black Death should leap From out the lair whence she may chance to peep. The chase tomorrow morn!” IV.A PARTY OF PLEASURE. The morrow morn At sunrise, to the sound of fife and horn, Byzantium's spacious marble wharves, from stair To stair, with broider'd cloths, and carpets rare Of crimson seam'd and rivell'd rough with gold, A train of swarthy servants spread and fold, For the proud treading of Imperial feet, Down to the granite pedestals; where meet Thick myrtle boughs, and oleanders flush The green-lit lymph. There, little galleys push Their golden prows beneath the glossy dark Of laurel leaves; and many a pleasure-bark Lolls in the sun, with streaming bandrol bright, And gorgeous canopies, that shut soft light Under soft shadow. Suddenly, shrill sounds The brazen music, and the baying hounds Drag sideways at the hunter's hand. The drums Throb to the screaming trumpet. And forth comes The Emperor. Then his courtiers: then his slaves. At sunset, to the wilds beyond the waves They came: light revellers arm'd with bow and spear, Cinct for the chase, and gay with hunting gear. With silk pavilions gleam the lonely glens, Glad of their unaccustom'd denizens That shout across dark tracts of starry weather. To grassy tufts young grooms, light-laughing, tether Sleek-coated steeds. And, where the bubbled brooks Leap under rushy brinks, white-turban'd cooks In silver vessels plunge the purple wine. Within the tents, the lucid tables shine (Under soft lamps from burning odours lit) With sumptuous viands; and young wassailers sit, With heated faces femininely fair, And holiday arms thick-sheathed with jewels rare, Babbling of battles. Round the mountain lawn The sportive court leans, propp'd on skins of fawn, And quilts thick-velveted of foreign fur, Marten, and zibeline, and miniver, Brought by the barbarous fair-hair'd folk that come Blithe from the north star, where they have their home Among the basalt rocks, and starry caves Stalactical, and walk upon the waves Sandall'd with steel. Low-sounding angelots Sprinkle light music in among the knots Of laughing boys that tinkle cups of gold Round heaps of grapes, and rough-globed melons cold, And purple figs. There, down the glimmering green Half-naked dance, with tossing tambourine, Greek girls, whose flusht and panting limbs flash bare Across the purple glooms. At dawn, they dare The distant crags, and storm the savage woods. Then, all day long, thro' slumbrous solitudes Flit the sweet ghosts of glad and healthful sounds Scatter'd from fairy horns, and flying hounds: And, in and out, among the thickets lone The dazzling tumult darts; as, one by one, Thro' bosk and brake, gay-gilded dragon flies Flash, and are gone. When mellow daylight dies, Well-pleased, they bear their shaggy burthen back To' the silken camp, adown the mountain track, And roast the bristly boar; and quaff and laugh, And sing, and ring the goblets gay; till, half Drowsed, and half roused again by rosy wine, They drink, and wink, and sink at last supine On the fresh herbage by their watchfires red; While the wind wakes the gloomy woods o'erhead Unnoticed, and unnoticed, now and then, Sound distant roarings from the rocky glen. So pass the days, the nights: so pass the weeks, The months. V.WHICH ENDS UNPLEASANTLY. At length, the Emperor upbreaks His wandering camp. Of wood and mountain tired, Town-life he deems once more to be desired. Aye, from illusion to illusion tost, Men seek new things, to prize things old the most. Life wastes itself by wishing to be more, And turns to froth and scum whilst bubbling o'er. Thus, having all things, save the joy they give, The Imperial pauper still is fain to live For means of life (which nothing known supplies) Dependent on the charity of surprise. Sick as he went, he to Byzance returns. There, from the warders on the walls he learns That his bold brother, whom (while he the chase Pursued) himself had charged to hold his place Is pleased to keep it; which the soldiery, bought, Are pleased to sanction; and the people, taught That Power in Place is Power where it should be, Pleased, or displeased, obedient bow the knee. 'Tis idle knocking at your own housedoor When your own housedog knows your voice no more. Fly, or be bitten! Flying all alone, (Friendless, being powerless) into Macedon, —A fugitive from his own guards, the scorn Of his tame creatures, turn'd on, hunted, torn By his own bandogs, Isaac,—yesterday Lord paramount of half a world, great, gay, Glorious, and strong,—today, a something less Than all earth's common kinds of wretchedness,— Fled from the refuse of himself; but, caught, And back a prisoner to Byzantium brought, They dropp'd him down a donjeon. VI.OUT OF THE LIGHT, INTO THE DARK. Four wet walls: Round which the newt, his sickly housemate, crawls To criticize, and, being abhorr'd, abhor What men had crown'd, and surnamed Emperor, And tremblingly admired. A mouldy crust, Some muddy water, once a day down thrust Into this putrid pit, still keep aware The nameless human thing forgotten there That it is wretched, and alive in spite Of wretchedness. In nothingness and night This nothing lives: cast out of Life, flung back By Death, unpitied. And, to make more black The blackness that is there to blot it out, The new-made Emperor beckon'd from the rout Of smiling and of crawling creatures,—things That do ill-make, and are ill-made by, kings, Feeders of infamy, and fed by it,— One that most smiled, and lowest crawl'd, to fit His master's humour: unto whom he said “Our Brother hath two eyes yet in his head, Worth nothing now to him, worth much to me. Get them away from him, and thou shalt be The gainer by his loss.” This deed was done. They left him in the dark. VII.ALEXIUS THE YOUNGER FLIES FROM ALEXIUS THE ELDER. He hath a son, This miserable remnant of man's being That lives and hath no life,—unseen, unseeing! God gave him both a brother and a son, And both men name Alexius. And the one Is Emperor now, and reigns, where he once reign'd, In bright Byzance; and drains, as he once drain'd, In agate cups, from vases crystalline, Careless, the Chian and the Lesbian wine, By princes pour'd: for him, the murex dies In Tyrrhene nets: for him, green Europe vies With tawny Asia, to extol his state: For him those twice ten thousand eunuchs wait In whisperous halls: for him, the Thracian spears March with the Macedonian mountaineers: And him men praise. Meanwhile, the other flees, Scaped from his clutch, across the great salt seas, And thanks kind heaven's rough winds that blow so rude Upon his cheek. Among the multitude, In seaman's garb, he, gliding secret, found A Venice galley for Sicilia bound: And, thence, thro' many lands, for many years, Wandering in search of succour from his peers, The exiled Prince draws far in foreign climes The breath of life; and broods upon the times. VIII.AND TRIES HIS FORTUNES AND HIS FRIENDS. But Greatness, God keeps fast upon its throne, Is ever prompt full greatly to disown Greatness by God struck down. The Pope is wise, Humane, and just. The Pope the Prince first plies With the sad story of his sire's distress. And ‘Pax vobiscum!’ sighs His Holiness. “Leonem, Optime, mox conculcabis” Urges the Prince, “me quoque liberabis “De laqueo venantium.” Whereunto The Pontiff “Cœlum dedit Domino, Hominum autem terram filiis. Schismatics, also, are ye Greeks, I wis.” And still the Prince “O Holy Father, stay! “The Greek shall to the Latin rite give way, If Latin arms the Grecian throne recover.” “Another time, my son, we'll talk this over. Festina lente. Vale!” sighs the Pope, And waives him off. He nurses yet his hope And flees to Germany. In Germany Philip is Kaiser; and by craft holds high A brow serene above the brawling crowd, —Fine-balanced on Fate's pinnacle, and proud. And Kaiser Philip hath, in summers fled, Irene, sister to Alexius, wed: And Kaiser Philip doth with deep concern The fallen fortunes of his kinsman learn: Concern'd the more, that he just now can spare Nor men, nor money; since his rival there, The lynx-eyed Otho, lurking for a spring, Crouches hard by, and troubles everything. The times are wild. Meanwhile, the Red Cross Lords (Five hundred sail, and thrice ten thousand swords) In Zara halt, the new Crusade to plan. And thither wends the Prince. IX.A GREAT MAN. Venetian Dandalo, Doge elect, and Amiral, And Captain, sits in solemn council hall. His long beard, lustrous with the spotless snows Of more than fourscore winters, amply flows To hide the angry jewel, clasp'd with gold, That firmly doth his heavy mantle hold. Cover'd he sits. Above his blind bald brow The Ducal bonnet (Tintoret shows ye how) Glows like a sunset glory on the scalp Of some sublime and thunder-scathèd alp. And the furr'd velvets o'er his breastplate fall In folded masses, as majestical As honours on the manhood of the man. Soon may ye tell, if ye his posture scan, By the grand careless calmness of the way His mantle laps and hangs, that in the play Of this world's business he hath ever been Chief actor, chosen for each foreground scene; Whence, living is to him a stately thing Made easy by long wont of governing. Those deep blind eyes for Venice' sake burn'd out! Since he, whom Venice fear'd, most fear'd, no doubt, Those eyes. The firm fine features of that face, In strength so delicate, so strong in grace! All those augustest opposites that mix In some superlative character, to fix With one strong soul, and grace with one fit frame, Man's evanescent elements, became Associate ministers to this man's will. —The symbols of the valley and the hill: The storm, the eagle, and the cataract,— Passions, and powers that passionately act; The streamlet, and the vineleaf in the sun,— Graces that gracious influence acts upon; Meet in the aspect of that bended head. And the great Lion of St. Mark doth spread His mighty wings above the baldachin That decks the throne; mute mid the trumpet's din, Claiming his own. The smooth and spacious floors Are open-porched. Thro' airy corridors You mark the marshal'd heralds, station'd calm About the broad stone platform, bathed in balm Of blissful weather, and the warm noon-light. Down the sloped hill, the streeted city white Hums populous. The sea-breeze, blowing in, Flutters gay flags in harbours Zaratin; Heaving on ballustraded ramparts wide, And at high casements, throng'd and balconied, Thick streams of many-colour'd silken scarves. And, all about the warmèd quays and wharves, The sea is strown with snowy sails, by swarms Of high-deck'd galleys, from whose prows the arms Of heroes hang, and low-hull'd palanders. X.AND SOME NOTABLE MEN. Meanwhile, among his council-keeping Sers, The great Doge greets from his unenvied throne The Barons, striding inwards, one by one, From that bright background, and the golden noon, Like banded forms on Byzant frescoes. Soon The hall is cramm'd. Below the high daïs sit Peers, princes, prelates, paladins. To wit:— The conqueror of Asti, Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat; who with his mace Can brain a bull. When Theöbald, their chief, Count of Champagne, left Christendom in grief, Dying untimely, and dispute arose About the headship, him the Barons chose (Favour'd by fame, tho' foreign to the Franks) As Dux and Daysman of the Red Cross Ranks. Baldwin; whose dreams are of a diadem, Since last the Turks have tugg'd Jerusalem From Lusignan; content to wait meanwhile As Count of Flanders, till his fortunes smile: Him, also, Hainault's hardy race respect, Scion of Charlemagne by line direct, And cousin to the Royalty of France. Beside him, having broken his last lance At Bruges, in that great tourney, when the twain First cross'd their shields, Count Henry, with his train Of Flanders knights. Sir Guy, the Gascon; grim Grey, gaunt, as on the Pyrenæan rim His own three cloudy border castles are, Held fast for his White Heiress of Navarre, Daughter of good King Sance, surnamed The Wise, Blanche with the golden hair and holy eyes.

And he of Trainel, learn'd Bishop of Troyes, Garniers; who back return'd Anon from spoil'd Byzance, “with nothing less” (Quoth Alberic) “to grace his diocess Than the true scull, from Grecian monks reclaim'd, Of Philip the Apostle. Near him (named By Gunther magnæ sanctitatis vir) Neuelon; “on whom the Pope was pleased confer Thessalonica's new archbishopric Some few years afterwards,” writes Alberic; Bishop, meanwhile, of Soissons; whose grandsire, Gerard, the Frankish chroniclers admire As “Castelain of Laon, and noble prince;” Return'd from Rome, well pleased, a fortnight since With absolution won from Innocent For Zara captured, to the discontent Of those that sought to break the Red Cross ranks, This prelate sits, requited by the thanks Of pious souls, in comfortable chat With those of Bethlehem and Halberstadt, Receiving praise of Fulk himself; the Monk Of Neuilly; who, when English Richard shrunk, And Frankish Philip, from his fierce appeal, Stirr'd up their Barons to a proper zeal; The Boänerges of the new crusade; A lean sharp-faced enthusiast, with shorn head And starry eyes,—no hawk's, from Norway brought, More vivid, or more vigilant,—his thought So flashes thro' them 'neath his cowl's grey serge. De Montfort; whom the Pope proclaims “God's scourge,” Tho' styled “Hell's Hangman” by the Albigeois, And “Bloody Simon.” Louis, Count of Blois And Chartre; the crownless kinsman of the kings Of France and England, whose high humour springs From blood twice royal. Peter of Courtenày; Whose sires upon the sons of kings, men say, Imposed their name and arms, “three torteaux, or,” Which Godfrey, Bouillon's famous chieftain bore In Christ's first battle for His sepulchre. Not the least warlike of these warriors were Those Bishops four, of Soissons, Bethlehem, And Halberstadt.

Eustache le Marchis, with his helmet on, And, undisguised, his quilted gamboison, Fret by no hauberk, half-way to his knee. Villers, and Aimory of Villerey, Peter of Braiquel, Eudo of the Vale, Rochfort, and Ardelliers, and Montmirail. Pietro Alberti; who, as simple Ser Of Venice, boasts his power to confer Titles, he deems less grand because his sire Help'd Dominic, the Doge, to get back Tyre (That famous town Agenor built, say some) From those two former foes of Christendom, The Egyptian Kailif, and that Soldan damn'd Who in Damascus kept his dungeons cramm'd With Christian souls: he fingers his gold chain, And, with a smile of careless gay disdain, Folds his patrician robe across his knees. Less grave, and chatting too much at his ease, Pataleone Barbo; whose renown, Scarce older than his senatorial gown, Folks yet dispute. Francesco Contarini: And that famed Ser, Thomaso Morosini: Lorenzo Gradenigo: Giammarìa Francesco Gritti, famed in Apulìa: Daniele Gozzi: Jacopo Pisani: And Giambattista Ercole Grimani; Noble Venetians. Side by side they sit, Grey faces in grave circle. Could I fit This rough-edged rhyme-work into finer frames For their smooth-vowell'd, voluble, sweet names, No wrong done, no wrench to them, bruise or wound —As when the torturer to his engine bound The melting-limb'd deliciousness of some Dear lady, doom'd to luckless martyrdom,— Friends, you should know their noblenesses all Henceforth for ever, and to mind recall By special name each serious face of them, Pale, mid its pomp of purple robe and gem, Forth peering over every fur-trimm'd vest. Search ye the Golden Volume for the rest, You whom fate favours, whosoe'er ye be, With leave, once lavish'd, long denied to me, To walk, a living man, in Venice' streets, Where ghost meets ghost, and spirit spirit greets, Among the doves and bells, and bounteous things Strewn 'twixt the sky that clings, the sea that clings To the sweet city,—'twixt gloom, glory, 'twixt Life, death, in maze inextricably mixt Of gorgeous labyrinth, Leaning by the wall, Near the great doorway, fair-hair'd, blue-eyed, tall, Behind St. Pol (who tunes, to pass the time, Humming unheard, an amorous Norman rhyme To the slow music of a Latin hymn) Bussy d'Herboise, the frank French knight, whose trim And sober surcoat, of no special hue, Attracts, by seeming to evade, the view. Ulric of Thun: and Charles of Aquitaine: Eberhard, count of Traun, and castelain Of the Imperial fortress of Pavìa: Giàn the Unnamed; for whom his mother Pia Forgot to choose a father ere she died, Being embarrass'd by a choice too wide; Martin the fighting Abbot; whose priest's gown Scarce hides the corselet which in Basil town He bought last month, to join the northern knights From windy burgs sea-beat on Baltic heights, Fair-meadow'd manors, and grey castles cold, 'Mid blue Bohemian woods, on windy wold In the dark Hartz, or Salzburg's mountains bleak. Henry of Ofterdingen, who the week Before, came bringing, for his part, indeed, Only his lute, his lance, his squire, his steed. Ludwig the Ironhead, of Falkenstein: Ulric the Hawk; whose mother Adeline Priests say the Pope will canonize next year: And Ottoker, men call the Blear-eyed Bear: The Duke of Styria, leaning on his shield, —A milk-white panther-rampant, on a field Vert: Witikind, Carinthia's Duke, some say The bastard son of Bilstein's Countess gay, Who, help'd by some sleek nameless Levantine, Contrives to keep alive the ducal line. Only the constellations and the suns Are call'd by kingly names: the millions Of lesser lights, in charts celestial, Are noticed merely by a numeral. These, but the special stars that strongest flame In foremost firmament. No need to name The many more, less noble, or less known, All known, all noble; all content to own A greater than their greatest in that great Grey-headed, blind, old man, who sits sedate And serious in their midst; the central soul Of this brute power which he doth all control, Shaping the many-minded multitude To oneness; both the worthless and the good, The weak, the strong. For he is born of those High seldom spirits that of all earth's shows Suck out the substance, and make all men's wills The agents of their own. XI.LE VALET DE CONSTANTINOPLE. The trumpet shrills Thrice in the outer porch, with brazen din, Thrice in the vestibule, and thrice within The vaulted aisles. Then, thro' the clanging arch, The gaunt, red-cross'd, steel-shirted heralds march. Then silence. Then, a humming, and a sound Of metal clink'd upon the marble ground, And, in between those six that, either side The column'd entry, gleam in tabards pied, Bare-headed, with no blazon on his breast, Comes the discrownèd Heir of all the East, Alexius Angelus, the last in line Of those Greek heirs to Christian Constantine, The Byzant Emperors. Who seeks for aid Must show how service sought can be repaid. Therefore the Prince, as soon as on bent knee He gave the Doge the Kaiser's letter,—free To plead his cause before the assembled knights Of Christendom, and urge his wrongs and rights, —Pledges himself to pay, upon his crown, Two hundred thousand marks of silver down: To join the Egyptian Pilgrims: and make cease The age-long schism dividing Rome and Greece: To find and furnish at his proper cost, For Christendom, and to the Red Cross Host, For one whole year, ten thousand mounted men, Soldier and horse: and, ever after then, A company of fifty knights,—a Band Vow'd to the service of the Holy Land.— “Le Valet de Constantinople,” states The Frankish Chronicler, whose pen relates What his eye witness'd, since himself was there, “Li cuers des genz esmeut, mainte lerme amere Moult durement plorant.” Thus, with filial tears, Comment and argument, to lay their fears And lift their valours,—now, with pour'd appeal To sacred Justice and the Public Weal, Now, hinting novel outlets to be won To teeming Trade,—until the set of sun, Full passionately pleading, spake the Prince. XII.A BLIND MAN SEES FAR. And all this time, Doge Dandalo,—for, since His sight was saved from surfaces and shows That grossly intercept the sight of those Who, seeing many things, see nothing thro', He with serene, unvext, internal view Beheld all naked causes and effects In that clear glass whereon the soul reflects, Unshaked by Time's distraught and shifting glare, Events and acts,—while passionately there The Prince stood pleading, saw, as in a trance, Constructed out of golden circumstance, The steadfast image of a far off thing Glorious, and full of wonder . . . . Clear upspring Into the deep blue sky the golden spires That top the milkwhite towers, like windless fires: O'er garden'd slopes, slant shafts of plumy palm Lean seaward from hot hillsides breathing balm: Green, azure, and vermilion, fret with gold, Blaze the domed roofs in many a globèd fold Of splendour, set with silver studs and discs: And, underneath, the solemn obelisks And sombre cypress stripe with blackest shade Sea-terraces, by Summer overlaid With such a lavish sunlight as o'erflows And drops between thick clusters of wild rose And clambering spurweed, down the sleepy walls To the broad base of granite pedestals That prop the gated ramparts, round about The wave-girt city; whence flow in and out The wealth and wonder of the Orient World: And, high o'er all this populous pomp, unfurl'd In the sublime dominions of the sun, And fann'd by floating Bosphorus breezes, won To waft to Venice each triumphant bark, The wing'd and warrior Lion of St. Mark! All this he saw beforehand: so foreknew What last great deed God kept for him to do: Which, being apprehended, was half done In his deep soul, though yet divined by none. So when the Prince had ended, and the Hall Began to buzz, and those flusht faces all To turn their glances on the Doge (because He was the inventor of their wills) no pause For further thought he needed: but smoothed down Across his knee one crease of his calm gown, And answer'd, very quietly, “It is good,” And rose. XIII.QUOT HOMINES TOT SENTENTIAE. But then began that multitude To murmur. And some said, “The thing is wild, And not to be endeavour'd.” Others smiled, Play'd silent with the pomels of their swords, And sided with the loudest. Many lords And many princes drew themselves aside, And, blaming all the rest, with ruffled pride, Took ship and so departed home again, Gnawing their beards and hinting high disdain. So was there great division of men's minds, And tempest worse than of the waves and winds When tides are equinoctial. It appears The priests first took each other by the ears, Arguing if war be lawful, waged as well On Christian sinner, as on infidel, Bid text trip text, and learning learning trample. The unlearnèd laics follow'd their example. Those Abbots stout of Loces and of Val With latin curses evangelical Denounced each other. Borland then took sail, And left the camp, followed by Montmirail. Froieville, and Belmont, and Vidame as well, And with them the boy Henry of Castèl, Went, swearing on the Holy Gospels Four To come again, but never came they more; Nor spared God's wrath the recreant fugitives, Of whom five hundred Barons lost their lives, Sunk in one ship, and hundreds more beside, Slaughter'd by peasants in Sclavonia, died. And daily still, some brawling baron went, Clinking his arms and clamouring discontent Whereon he in his burgs and towers would brood. The Doge said very quietly “It is good.” Now, of the remnant of the Red Cross Ranks The most part were Venetians, the rest Franks. END OF PART I. PART II. “Li bruis fu mult granz par le dedenz, et le message s'en tornent, &amp; vienent à la porte, et montent sur les chevaux. Quant ils furent de fors la porte, ni ot celui ne fust mult liez et ne fu mie granz mervoille, qui il erent mult di grant peril escampé: que mult se tint à pou, que il ne furent tuit mort, &amp; pris.” Geoffroy de Ville-Hardouin, c. 113, p. 86. I. THE EMPEROR MAKES A PROCLAMATION. On all the walls and gateways of the town Of great Byzantium, passing up and down, Men read this placard: “IN THE EMPEROR'S NAME, Great, gracious, just, and clement! let his fame Endure, whom may God bless and keep! Amen. People! It is notorious to all men That one Alexius, son of Isaac (late Emperor of the East; whom, by just fate And the high hand of Heaven dethroned, our grace And clemency, ill-merited, did place In safety, suffering him to live) hath stirr'd By treasonable act and traitrous word Against our state a barbarous armament Of Latins, chiefly out of Venice sent And France; pretexting in the misused name Of Christendom, by them deceived, the same High cause which our own arms have heretofore Not slightly served, in famous fields of yore. Now therefore, having call'd about our throne Our loyal liegemen, we to all make known That we have set our price upon the head (Six, if alive, three thousand, byzants, dead) Of this Alexius Angelus, self-styled Prince and Augustus, falsely, since exiled And forfeit of his life, and titles all. By order of our Lord Imperial and Paramount, his servant Muzufer.” And after this, the city was astir With rumours; and, from ramparts, wharves, and streets Wild whisperers watch'd the coming of the fleets. II. AND RECEIVES THE AMBASSADORS. When the Ambassadors of Venice, France, And the Allied Crusade, bearing the lance And lion of St. Mark, the gonfalon O' the Holy See, the sword, and habergeon, And mace of Charlemagne, with heralds came, Before the Emperor, and the amber flame Of the great Oriental sunlight flow'd Thro' the long-galleried hall, and hotly glow'd About the pillar'd walls with purple bright, They were at first as men whom too much light Staggers, and blinds; so much the inopinate Magnificence and splendour of his state Amazed them. At the Emperor's right hand, Tracing upon the floor with snaky wand Strange shapes, was standing his astrologer And mystic, Ishmael the son of Shur, A swarthy, lean, and melancholy man, With eyes in caverns, an Arabian. Who seem'd to notice nothing, save his own Strange writing on the floor before the throne. At the Emperor's feet, half-naked, and half-robed With rivulets of emeroldes, that throbb'd Green fire as her rich breathings billow'd all Their thrill'd and glittering drops, crouch'd Jezraäl, The fair Egyptian, with strange-colour'd eyes Full of fierce change and somnolent surprise. She, with upslanted shoulder leaning couch'd On one smooth elbow, sphynx-like, calm, and crouch'd, Tho' motionless, yet seem'd to move,—its slim Fine slope so glidingly each glossy limb Curv'd on the marble, melting out and in Her gemmy tunic, downward to her thin Clear ankles, ankleted with dull pale gold. Thick gushing thro' a jewell'd hoop, down roll'd, All round her, rivers of dark slumbrous hair, Sweeping her burnisht breast, sharp-slanted, bare, And sallow shoulder. This was the last slave The Emperor loved. No sea-nymph in a cave Ever more indolently dreaming lay, Lull'd by low surges, on a summer's day. The midnight theft of some Bohemian witch, Stol'n from a Moslem mother, when the rich Turk camps in Carmel fled before the cross That lured the remnant left by Barbaross To Suabia's Duke, was Jezraäl. Four black dwarves Like toads, green-turban'd, and in scarlet scarves, The four familiars of the fair witch-queen, With fans of ostrich feathers, dipt in sheen Arabian dyes and redden'd at the rims, Stood round her, winnowing cool her coilèd limbs. And, behind these, on either side the throne, Stand two tame jackals to Apollyon: One, in his right, across his shoulder props An axe, and from his left a loose cord drops, And he is nameless, and his trade is death. The other, whose silk vest flows loose beneath The small enamell'd dagger at his hip, Smiles, with a restless finger at the lip; Sleek, subtle, beauteous, bloodless minister Of evil; and men call him Muzufer; And when he smiles the people are afraid, And hide themselves. And smiling is his trade. The Ambassadors of the Red-cross'd Allies Spake to the Emperor upon this wise, “The supreme Pontiff of the Holy See Of Rome, in concert with the sovereign, free Republic of St. Mark, the Chevisance, And gentlemen of Germany and France In arms,—by us, Charles, Count of Aquitaine, Eberhard, lord of Traun, and Castelain Of the Imperial fortress of Pavìa, Lorenzo Gradenigo, Giammarìa Francisco Gritti, Jacopo Pisani, And Giambattista Ercole Grimani, Noble Venetians,—to Alexius, styled And titled, falsely, Emperor, who despoil'd His brother of the purple and high place Of power, to him allotted by God's grace: —Render to Cæsar what is Cæsar's own, And unto God good deeds: restore the throne, By thee usurp'd with sacrilegious sword, To Isaac, thine hereditary lord And master: and so live, forgiven of men And God. But if thou dost not this, know then Thou art accurst, and anathematised.” The Egyptian lifted her large eyes, surprised, And laugh'd. The scarlet-clad huge-handed man That stood behind, with axe and cord, began, Under a snarling lip, to gnash white teeth. The other monster half out of its sheath Lifted his dagger, with the self-same smile Wherewith he had been listening all this while. The Emperor glanced at Jezraäl, and said, “Yon young French Envoy hath a comely head. Answer him, girl.” The glittering witch leap'd up With a shrill laugh, and seized a golden cup, And shook her sparkling tunic to green flame, And, hand on haunch, made answer “In the name Of Satan, and the Powers that be! Who saith To Life ‘Live not: give up thy place to Death?’ Who calleth to the Sun ‘Come down: make way For Darkness?’ Who demandeth of the Day To give his golden palace to the Night? Life answers ‘Fool! I live.’ And, saith the Light, ‘Thou fool! I shine.’ Who cannot keep his throne May lose it: whiles he hath it, 'tis his own. And, were I Emperor, I would answer ‘Lo! Upon all hills that rise, all waves that flow, And on the lives and souls of men, is cast The shadow of my purple. Heaven is vast, And Hell is deep. And God, if God there be, Doth hide Himself, to leave this world to me. Mankind is my tame dog; and, knowing it, Fawns on me; on whose collar there is writ Sum Cæsaris. The world is but a wheel That draws my chariot. I hold fast my heel Upon the neck of my cringed vassal, Time. Fear is my slave: my household creature, Crime. The Lords of Hell are my retainers. When I frown or smile, all Valour dies in men, Virtue in women: men and women are mine, Body and soul: their blood is in my wine, The lion croucheth on my palace floors: And Life and Death are suppliants in my doors. The bolted thunder hangeth on my walls, And, lo ye, when I nod the thunder falls!’” “The thunder hangeth in the hand of God,” Lorenzo cried; “and falleth at His nod. See ye, from yonder golden pole, that props The baldachin his burnisht barb o'ertops, The many-coloured silken streamers fall? The same hand, from the same silk, fashion'd all, Nor hath the stuff with purple tinct imprest Essential value more than all the rest. Great Cæsar with his fortunes to admit Death opes his doors no wider by a whit Than for the beggar buried in a ditch. The dust is brother to the dust. Seeing which, And that alone the actions of the just Are lords forever, and defy the dust, Repent! spread sackcloth on thy former sin. For, by the Living Lord that listeneth in The everlasting silences on high, I swear—beneath the patience of the sky, Beneath yon gorgeous canopy, beneath Yon golden roof, tho' incensed by the breath Of prostituted slaves like this, and throned In pomp, and girt with power, and crown'd, and zoned With the imperial purple of the East, Alexius is a miscreant, and a beast. And God shall say to him, as to that other Whom he resembles, ‘Cain, where is thy brother?’ But thou, dread degradation of the form Of woman,—what art thou, strange glittering worm? What public mother, to what sire unknown, Spawn'd thee, shamed creature of a shameless throne, That dost with insult answer Christendom?” The Egyptian sprang, then stood death-white. A hum As of a hornet's nest, all round the hall, Responded to her gesture, augural Of wrath. She stood, a sorceress brewing storm: The jewels crackled on her stiffening form: Her wild unholy eyes flash'd hate: the breath, Drawn sharply in, hiss'd thro' her sparkling teeth Close clench'd. But her rude lord, with laughter rough, Waved to her a careless hand, and call'd ‘Enough! Crouch.’ And she crouch'd: then, like a beaten child, Whimper'd upon the marble. Drily smiled The Emperor; and to Muzufer he said, “The old Venice Envoy hath a reverend head Answer thou him.” But he, “Great Lord, I have Not any knowledge nor experience, save (What much, I doubt, delights not these grave Sers) A little, of the various characters Of wines and women. Nor indeed have I Enough of latinised theology To answer, text for text, this reverend man.” The Emperor laugh'd. “Speak thou, Arabian, That knowest all things.” Then the Arab said “Nebuchadnezzar reign'd: and he is dead. When Babylon was mistress of the world, He was the lord of Babylon. Death furl'd His face in dark: and him the world forgot. Greek Alexander reign'd: his bones do rot. This little earth was smaller than his state, He held it in his hand. Men call'd him Great. At last God blew his life out like a spark, And he became a darkness in the dark. To Alaric the eagle gave his wing, His claw the lion, and the snake her sting. His clarions, blown upon the seven hill tops, Shook the round globe. Grasses the wild goat crops Grow over him. A little sickness made Of all he was nothing but dust and shade. Attila reign'd. The strong Huns worship'd him. All mankind fear'd him. He was great and grim. Rome grovell'd at his feet. One night he ceased. The worms upon his flesh have held high feast. Behind the hosts of suns and stars, behind The rushing of the chariots of the wind, Behind all noises and all shapes of things, And men, and deeds, behind the blaze of kings Princes and paladins and potentates, An immense solitary Spectre waits. It has no shape: it has no sound: it has No place: it has not time: it is, and was, And will be: it is never more, nor less, Nor glad, nor sad. Its name is Nothingness. Power walketh high: and Misery doth crawl: And the clepsydra drips: and the sands fall Down in the hourglass: and the shadows sweep Around the dial: and men wake, and sleep, Live, strive, regret, forget, and love, and hate, And know it not. This spectre saith, ‘I wait.’ And at the last it beckons, and they pass. And still the red sands fall within the glass: And still the shades around the dial sweep: And still the water-clock doth drip and weep: And this is all.” “Yea,” said the Emperor, “then If thus it fare with the world's mighty men, And there be no more greatness in the dust, How fares it with the men the world calls just, Who lived not for the body but the mind, Augustin, Plato, Socrates?” “Behind The mingled multitude of mortal deeds Call'd good or ill, behind all codes and creeds, All terrors, all desires, all hopes, all fears, Behind all laughter, and behind all tears,” The Arabian said, “this shapeless Spectre waits. And no man knoweth what it meditates.” Frowning, he turn'd, and fashion'd as before, With snaky wand, upon the porphyry floor Strange figures, cube, and pentagram, and sphere. The Emperor mused; then murmur'd in the ear Of Muzufer some word whereto replied That minister “Let your Majesty decide. Yet I have heard what Emperors decree Heaven doth approve; whereby it seems to me This maxim may be broadly understood, That for the good o' the state all means are good.” Thereat the Emperor rose; and from his face Suddenly all its smiling ceased,—gave place Forthwith to hate too deadly for disguise; As when thro' sultry, seeming-empty skies Suddenly rushes, wrapt in glare and gloom, The blood-red darkness of the strong simoom. With lips that labour'd 'neath the weight and strain Of wrath, he cried “You—Sir of Acquitane, You—Sir of Traun—whose title we ignore, Whose master styles himself an Emperor, And is . . . . a puny Suabian Duke! You,—all, Of Venice—whose nobility we call, Like its new banner and filch'd patron both, Of doubtful origin, and upstart growth! This is our answer to your host, and you: —Come ye as peaceful pilgrims, to pursue A pious journey to Jerusalem? Then, nor your course we check, nor zeal condemn; Then, market free, and passage fair, expect; Our wealth shall aid you, and our power protect. But come ye here, in hostile arms array'd, The sanctuary of Empire to invade? Then,—mark me! as I live . . . . as I that speak Am Emperor both of Roman and of Greek, (Mark me!) I swear—and swear it by the line Of God-like Cæsars all since Constantine, —Your myriads, were they ten times what they be, Our scorn shall sweep from land, and sweep from sea, As easily as yon light fan could sweep A swarm of midges from the unvext sleep Of our dark-eyelash'd leman. And, in pledge Of power to smite,—not less than we allege, Our answer prompt to your barbarian crew Shall be your heads . . . . the head of each of you! Yours—Sir of Acquitaine! yours—Sir of Traun! Fresh trophies for each gate of yonder town! And yours—Venetian! . . . . yours! and yours! and yours! Ho, in the gallery, there! Bar all the doors. No foot budge hence till we be satisfied!” “Disloyal lord! . . . . Enough!” Lorenzo cried. “For us,—our response shall, in thunder-falls, Be heard anon round yonder doomèd walls, And rain'd in blood—less innocent than ours, Ay, and less pure!—round yonder traitrous towers. For thee,—mock emperor, true barbarian! Whose image, stamp'd in the alloy of man, Sullies the wealth that buys obedience base To Treason trembling on a throne,—disgrace Would be grace wasted. But hark . . . . ye, his slaves! Who falls on us must fall on iron staves. 'Ware, the first traitor here, that lifts his hand! Christ and His cause about this banner stand. For every hair upon our heads, a host In arms, for Justice wrong'd, shall claim the cost. 'Ware, the first slave that stands across our path To yonder door! This wingèd lion hath —(For God, the giver of all strength to men, Shall smite the smiter now, Who smote him then) The self-same strength between the wings of him That once, between the wingèd Cherubim, In Ashdod smote usurping Dagon down, And shatter'd in the dust his idol crown, Before the captived but triumphant Ark. Now,—God defend the Right, and good St. Mark!” Forthwith outfurl'd, in resonant circle shone Round those eight knights the rustling gonfalon. And, thro' a hundred hands with hired swords To murder purchased, march'd the Red Cross Lords Majestic, unmolested, down the hall, Strode thro' the startled Guards Imperial, And from the treacherous threshold pass'd in scorn. Alexius, with white lips, and garment torn, Scream'd “Cowards! slaves! Is Cæsar disobey'd? Traitors! a hundred byzants for each head Of those eight churls! Up, bloodhounds! or the whip Shall mend the mongrel valour that lets slip An Emperor's quarry!” But the Eight meanwhile, Spurring full speed, had pass'd the embattled pile Of the great gate. Foil'd, as they forward sprang, Down in the gap the shrill portcullis rang. END OF PART II. END OF VOL. I. VOL. II. BOOK VI. (Continued.) THE SIEGE OF CONSTANTINOPLE.

Thereafter, met for mischief and debate Morose, within a certain intricate Small chamber, plann'd for plotting, with slant glooms In glooms, beyond a maze of banquet rooms, Muzufer and his liege lord up and down Were pacing leopard-like. Meanwhile, the town Mutter'd outside the porphyry porches all Like souls perturb'd in Purgatorial Abysses paced by lamentable throngs; As to and fro i' the streets with surly songs Among his myrmidons the headsman strode, Beckoning in turn from each condemn'd abode (So to appease the Emperor's discontent Of his own creatures for that morn's event) Some terror-stricken wretch whose mangled limb, —Lopp'd foot or hand,—must serve ere dark to trim Arch, column, obelisk, and cornice, where Already sallow-visaged slaves prepare The midnight banquet, o'er great gardens gay With placid statues, and the luminous play Of perfumed waters, leaping pure upon Lipp'd lavers large of black obsidian Or alabaster fill'd with filmy light. For 'mid his Court the Emperor sups to-night. And in that chamber dim where these debate, O'er the low bronzen door elaborate, Some old Greek sculptor (dead an age ago Ere Pisa yet brought forth her wondrous Two, For Florence' sake, and all the world's, to impart New sweetness to his barbarous Christian art) Had wrought in monstrous imagery, bold, Uncouth, and drear despite of paint and gold, Christ tempted of the Devil upon the Mount: Varying the tale the Evangelists recount After the manner of the artist's mind. Colossal forms! the Saviour of mankind, And Tempter,—not alluring he, but grim As the grim Middle Age imagined him; Satan; that ancient hodman of the souls That God forgets; in corners, dens, and holes Where'er Sin squats, taking what he can find, He rakes earth's offal for that hod behind His hateful back; God's scavenger is he; Who here, with obscene gesture coarse and free, Hell's twy-prong in his claw-bunch-fingers clutch'd, Picks from the rubbish at his shoulder hutch'd, And proffers to the Son of Man, a crown. Now, while these two were pacing up and down In moody talk, and Muzufer began To praise and pity much that day's marr'd plan, As being shrewdly plotted,—righteous, too, If rightly look'd at . . . . “For, Sir Emperor, who Disputes the right of Christian Emperors To slay the infidel ambassadors Of Moslem monarchs, that by nature stand Outside the law of every Christian land? Yet Christians that, unchristianly, oppose Your Christian Majesty, are, certes, foes More formidable, therefore worse by far, Than merely Ottoman and Moslem are. Meanwhile, they have escaped us. We have fail'd. Which is a pity. Fifty slaves impaled Will poorly, poorly at the best, replace Those eight Frank heads which we had hoped should grace This evening's banquet. For altho' we preach Thereby a wholesome homily to each Incipient traitor, and altho', indeed, These cravens merit death, methinks you feed On your own limbs thus—prey on your own power, Devour'd the more, the more that you devour.” —He speaking thus, against the bronzen door Alexius struck his fist fierce-clench'd, and swore An angry oath that neither Heaven nor Hell Should mar that evening's merriment. Then there fell With clink and clatter, by that blow shaked down, Out of the Devil's claw the Devil's crown Striking the Emperor's foot. The two stood still, And stared upon each other. “Omen ill!” Mused Muzufer. “Hell's Monarch's clutch is not So sure but it lets go what it hath got.” Alexius, laughing, answer'd quick “Not so. Nor is it the first time I have stoop'd as low To get,—nor, gotten, thank'd the Devil for This glittering hoop.” And “Ay, Sir Emperor!” With mimic mirth laugh'd Muzufer. Within His dusky niche a sympathetic grin The wrinkled visage of the Father Fiend Emitted, till his coarse brows seem'd thick-vein'd, And dull eye seem'd to wink with dismal glee. So all together laugh'd that Wicked Three, While Day, to reach the West's red innermost With lurid foot the lucid pavement crost. Then at the casement Muzufer cried “Hark! The butchery has begun before 'tis dark. One . . two . . three . . four . . five wretches? how they twist On those spiked staves! Sure, that's a woman's wrist And hand there, with the fluttering fingers? Phew! We must not sup to windward of this stew, Or you will find the hippocrass smell strong. Burn, burn benzoin! How heavily hums along Yon beetle, caring nothing for it all, —Fool, and it sets me talking!” “The shades fall Fast,” cried Alexius. “Come! the Banquet waits.” II.GAVE AWAY WHAT HE NO LONGER POSSESSED. And while he spake, Byzantium's golden gates From silver clarions to the setting sun Breathed farewells musical; and, Day being done, Night enter'd swift to meet the Sons of Night. Not black however, but in blaze of light Luxurious. Gardens. Galleries. Walls o'erlaid With marvellous, many-colour'd marbles, made By multitudes of fragrant flames, that pant From flashing silver lampads, fulgurant: Cornelian, agate, jasper, Istrian stone And Canan mix'd, to shame the glories gone From Roman streets since first Mamurra had His own housewalls with milkwhite marble clad. And down deep lengths of glowing colonades The dim lamps twinkle soft thro' slumbrous shades Around rich-foliaged frieze, and capitals Of columns opening into halls and halls Warm with sweet air, and wondrous colour roll'd From rare mosaics—azure dasht with gold; 'Neath domes of purple populous with star On star of silver, coved o'er circular Vermiculated pavements interlaid With wreaths of flowers and intricatest braid Of delicate device, about the base Of granite basins broad, which all the race Of sea-gods and sea-horses linger round, In love for ever with the long cool sound Of lucent waters that low-laughing fall And fall from pedestal to pedestal Among those curling nymphs and tritons bold That bridle restive dolphins rein'd with gold. Beyond, 'twixt pillar'd range and statued plinth, The lustrous maze of marble labyrinth Unfolds; and, disentangling from itself Its luminous spaces, spreads into a shelf Of shining floorage carpeted with deep Thick-tufted crimsons, soft as summer sleep Under the footsteps of delicious dreams. O'er which, thro' dark arcades, steal airy gleams And sumptuous odours, and melifluous waves Of music that with swimming languor laves Dim gardens green and deep, and flowery plots Where minstrels strike their golden angelots, And sing—now, Cæsar's splendour, Cæsar's state, That doth Olympian glories emulate, —And now, lascivious songs, the wanton loves Of Mars and Venus,—till the lemon groves Are loud with lyric rapture. Piled and built On glowing tables, garlanded and gilt, Of Mauritanian tree, the Banquet shines, —Bright-beaming vessels brimm'd with costly wines, And savorous fruits on golden salvers heap'd, And smoking meats in misty spices steep'd— All round the terraced porch. In plenitude Of power, here, midmost of his multitude Of Greek Patricians robed in purple pomp Alexius sits. Meanwhile the bronzen tromp, Blown from dim-gaping galleries far behind, Strives, with the clang of sudden cymbals join'd, To crush all feebler sound out of each dull Low wail, or intense shriek, that in the lull Of that loud music ever and anon Some wind, from outer darkness pour'd upon The palace thresholds, pulsing passionate, Contrives to filter thro' the golden grate. Along a brilliant frieze of burnish'd wall That beams behind the throne Imperial, In rangèd groups emboss'd and painted, blaze Byzantine sculptures that perpetuate praise Of Trajan's Justice, and the Sages Seven Of Antique Greece: between whose tablets driven Great cedarn beams, that prop the deep pavilion, Drop cataracts down of silken streams vermilion. Beneath, in bronze, Alcides with his club, And that she-wolf that had for sucking cub Rome's founder. But before the Emperor gleam High argent censers, whence thick odours stream From left to right in vast voluptuous clouds Of incense that with floating mist enshrouds His glory like a God's. And by his side At his left hand, dark-hair'd delicious-eyed Egyptian Jesraäl leans. Around her twine The curling odours, and the fragrant wine Is lucent on her humid lip: and he, Beneath the loaded board, with amorous knee Frets her lascivious tunic's light-spun folds, And in hot palm her languid finger holds. Anon, with heated eyes, turning from her (All glitter and all glare) to Muzufer (All gravity, all gloom) that sits meanwhile On his lord's right,—forgetting even to smile So much his mind is busy at the task Of plotting how to slip from life's main masque Silently, unperceived, by some side-way Into safe darkness, ere God's Judgment lay Pride's revel all in ruins . . . for he read Strange writing on the walls,—Alexius said “What wise and weighty matter is astir Behind those knitted brows?” Then Muzufer, Like one surprised without his armour on, Caught up his smile in haste, and answer'd “None, Great Master, weigh more anxiously than I The mighty interests of Your Majesty; Whose greatness needs must oft oppress the brain Compell'd its utmost faculty to strain In contemplating the august extent Of power that doth, as doth heaven's firmament, Invest the world with glory. Who oppose Your Majesty, oppose mankind, which owes From realms unnumber'd homage to your rule. Who doubts this is a miscreant and a fool: Whoe'er Your Majesty's most sacred, high, And solemn rights dare question or deny Is a vile traitor and an arrant knave: But they that now in arms presume to brave Your power supreme are sinners more accurst Than any, save (if such there be) that worst Of wicked men that, being Grecian born, This barbarous rabble doth not loathe and scorn More than Turk, Jew, or Saracenic scum Of nameless nations scorn'd by Christendom. If such there be, were he my father's son, Myself would hold, to hang that caitiff on, No gibbet high enough. My thoughts are these.” “Paul's body!” quoth Alexius, “well they please Our passing humour. Wherefore we assign Hereby, from this time forth to thee and thine In title principal, and lordship free, Our palace of Chalcedon by the Sea.” And while he spake thus, echoed by the shout “Long live Alexius!” from the gates without Hoarse hubbub stream'd, and up the revelling hall, Bearing the banner'd bird imperial, A legionary captain, pale with fear, Made way towards the throne. To whom “What cheer?” With husky wine-quench'd voice the Emperor cried, And to the Emperor, rueful, he replied “Ill cheer, Sir Emperor! The Latin Host Hath fall'n upon Chalcedon. We have lost Many brave men, and one fair palace you.” “Pish!” cried the Emperor. “The Franks are few. What's lost to-night may be to-morrow won, Palaces be there many a fairer one For us to feast in, you to fight for, still. Begone!” III.WHAT WAS SHOWN TO THEOCRITE, THE MONK. So feasted they. No bird of ill With boding note around the rooftree croak'd, Nor bearded star the mason'd turrets stroked, Nor howl'd the hoarse wolf near the revelling town. Only, that night a marvellous thing was shown To Theocrite the Monk, when he in prayer, After long fast went forth to breathe the air What time the air was stillest. For to him Appear'd in heaven, above the city dim, The helmeted Arch-Angel of high God, That in his right hand held a measuring rod, Stretch'd over all the East. To whom God gave Command to measure out a mighty grave Wherein to bury and hide from human eye The body of a world about to die. This thing in vision at the mid of night, 'Twixt heaven and earth, was shown to Theocrite. END OF PART III.

I.JUSTICE “Te lucis ante terminum” . . . . and lo, One half of heaven is wrapt in rosy glow! “Rerum creator poscimus” . . . . the hymn Sweet-heaving swells o'er solemn air and dim. Sunset. A few large stars. The sea-wind vents Among the narrow-streeted silken tents, From Chalcedonian palace chambers calm, The lofty, pure, sonorous Latin psalm Forth-pour'd by sworded priests athwart the tramp And hoarse buzz humming deep from camp to camp Of those six battles, ranged and banner'd all Under the Counts of Flanders, of St. Paul, Of Montmorency, of Blois, and Montferrat Who, with his Lombards, holds the rear, stretch'd flat Behind the city, lengthening many a mile Into the midnight toward St. Stephen's pile.— And all athwart this rustling region far Buzz'd over by the sounding wings of War (That frets and flutters, bound in brazen chain, And breasts his iron cage) from brain to brain One passionate purpose seethes. For now those eight Ambassadors, return'd, with wrath relate In clamorous conclave their scorn'd embassage: Whose high compeers consult how best to wage Now-imminent conflict with self-confident Crime, And wield the weighty instrument of Time, Ready to smite. So, after lowly prayer, Each Knight upon his naked sword doth swear A solemn oath to see dread justice done, And rouse the slumbering war at rise of sun. Therefore, all night, the humming tents about, By twos and threes conversing, in and out 'Twixt mighty mangonel, and wheelèd tower Arm'd with spring-shoulder'd arbalists of power, The great chiefs stride indignant. II.ARMED At sunrise The six-times-folded Battle, serpent-wise, Slid past Blachernæ, and with steely fold At sunset wrapt grey Boemond's castle hold. There, by long labouring in the dark, was made All round the camps deep trench and palisade; 'Gainst which the war for many a night and day Flared, rock'd, and roar'd. Full hard it were to say What multitudes of mighty deeds were done, Since first Lascaris by the Bourgignon Was captived, till the Danish curtle axe Dropp'd on the walls, before those fierce attacks Which, all unarm'd, Eustache Le Marchis led, Only an iron cap upon his head. III.BY SEA AND LAND Meanwhile, at sea, the white Fleet, following, Hover'd hard by; and crept with cautious wing Under the wave-girt city; planting there A formidable grove. Not anywhere Thro' seas and skies were ever sail'd or row'd Ships huge as these. The Paradiso proud, Like a broad mountain, monarch of the morn, By the mad clutch of tumbling Titans torn Down from the windy ruins of the sky, With Jove's chained thunders throbbing silently In his strong pines, adown the displaced deep Shoulders the Pelegrino,—half asleep, With wavy fins each side a scarlet breast Slanted. Hard by, more huge than all the rest, —Air's highest, water's deepest, denizen, A citadel of ocean, throng'd with men That tramp in silk and steel round battlements Of windy wooden streets, mid terrced tents And turrets, under shoals of sails unfurl'd, —That vaunting monster, Venice calls “The World.” And now is pass'd each purple promontory Of Sestos and Abydos, famed in story, And now all round the deep blue bay uprise Into the deep blue air, o'er galleries Of marble, marble galleries; and lids O'er lids of shining streets; dusk pyramids O'er pyramids; and temple walls o'er walls Of glowing gardens, whence white sunlight falls From sleepy palm to palm; and palace tops O'ertopp'd by palaces. Nought ever stops The struggling Glory, from the time he leaves His myrtle-muffled base, and higher heaves His mountain march from golden-grated bower To bronzen-gated wall,—and on, from tower To tower,—until at last deliciously All melts in azure summer and sweet sky. Then, after anthem sung, sonorous all The bronzen trumpets to the trumpets call; Sounding across the sea from bark to bark, Where floats the wingèd Lion of St. Mark, The mighty signal for assault. A shout Shakes heaven. And swift from underneath upspout Thick showers of hissing arrows that down-rain Their rattling drops upon the walls, and stain The blood-streak'd bay. The floating forest groans, And creaks, and reels, and cracks. The rampart-stones Clatter and shriek beneath the driven darts. And on the shores, and at the gates, upstarts, One after one, each misshaped monster fell Of creaking ram, and cumbrous mangonel, Great stones, down-jumping, chop, and split, and crush The rocking towers; wherefrom the spearmen rush. The morning star of battle, marshalling all That movement massive and majestical, Gay through the tumult which it guides doth go The grand grey head of gallant Dandalo. With what a full heart following that fine head, —Thine, noble Venice by thy noblest led! In his blithe-dancing turret o'er the sea, Glad as the grey sea-eagle, hovers he Thro' sails in flocks and masts in avenues. Elsewhere, the inland battle, broken, strews With flying horse the hollows; while but ill The heavy-harness'd Frankish Knighthood still Strains, staggering as each Flanders stallion falls, In the rear region, round the city walls, Against those silken turms and squadrons light, That follow and fly, scatter and reunite, Tormenting their full-bulk'd too-cumbrous foe; Like swarms of golden bees that come and go About the bear whose paw is on their hive Patient and pertinacious, tho' they drive Their stings into his eyes, settle and swarm, Disperse and close again, to do him harm, Unharm'd. For there in splendour eminent Is pitch'd the purple-topt Imperial tent, And domes of crimson glow i' the azure sky, Girt by Byzantium's gorgeous chivalry. So to the kindling of the Even Star The groaning-hearted battle greatens. IV.IS TRIUMPHANT. Far And near the strong siege tugs by sea and land The storm-struck city,—hugg'd on either hand By heavy ruin—till from mast to wall, From sea to shore, the high drawbridges fall, And in mid-air the arm'd men march, and drop On battlemented roof and turret top. The deadly Greek fire dips, and drips, and crawls, And twists, and runs about the ruining walls, And all is blaze and blackness, glare and gloom. Pietro Alberti, the Venetian, whom His sword lights, shining naked 'twixt his teeth Sharp-gripp'd, thro' rushing arrows, wrapt with death, Leaps from his ship into the waves: now stands On the soak'd shore: now climbs with bleeding hands And knees the wall: now left, now right, swift, bright, Wild weapons round him whirl and sing: now right, Now left, he smites, fights, shakes, breaks, all things down. The Standard of St. Mark is on the town! André d' Herboise, the gallant gay French knight, Fast following him, hath gain'd the other height. Prompt as a plunging meteor, that strikes straight And instantaneous thro' the intricate Thick-crowded stars its keen aim, flitting thro' The choked breach, flashes dauntless Dandalo. In rush the rest. In clattering cataract The invading host rolls down. Disrupt, distract, The invaded break and fly. The great church bells Toll madly, and the battering mangonels Bellow. The priests in long procession plant The cross before them, passing suppliant To meet the marching conquest. With fierce cries Against the throne the rabble people rise, And slaves cast off their fetters, and set free Their hidden hates. For aye the craven knee That meekest crooks, adoring present power, Before the little idol of the hour, Is cousin to the craven hand that smites Most fiercely down the image it delights To insult and shame when greater gods wax wroth. V.SICUT FUMUS. Now, therefore, when Alexius saw that both The creatures and destroyers of his power Were on him, to his soul he said—“The Hour Is mine no more. Soul, we have lived our day.” Then, waiting for the night, he fled away Into the night. Night took him by the hand And led him silently into the land Of darkness. Darkness o'er his forehead cast Her mighty mantle, murmuring “Mine, at last!” In the great audience chamber at Byzance A Latin soldier, leaning on his lance Fatigued with slaughter, on the marble ground Blood-bathed an empty purple garment found. And then, for the first time, immersed in thought, The Latin soldier mutter'd “I have fought Against an Emperor!” Jewels in her head And serpents in her hand,—smiling, and dead, And beautiful in death,—each glorious globe (Loosed from the glittering murrey satin robe) Of her upturn'd defiant bosom, bare Save for the few looks of delicious hair That swept them—saved by scornful death from scorn— Only the beauty left of her—at morn They found the Egyptian Jezraäl. So fades Star after star along the cypress glades, Face after face from the rose-bowers: so song After song dies the lonesome lawns along. Each to his time! The revel and the rout Lamp after lamp, mask after mask, go out; Still for new singers the old songs to sing In the same place to the same lute-playing: Still for new dancers, to new tunes the same Dance dancing ever, to take up the game All lose in turn. Another time begins. New passions, and new pleasures, and new sins, For ever the old failure in new forms; To fashion a metropolis for worms And write in dust man's moral! Meanwhile, where Hides Muzufer? what doth he? how doth fare? How fares the small sunshiny insect thing That feeds on death and in the beam doth sing, When quench'd the beam, and stopp'd the moment's play? Nature both brings to birth and sweeps away Myriads of minims such: whose souls minute For loss or gain doth Heaven or Hell compute? Please they, or tease they, how shall Fate devise Fit retribution for dead butterflies? Then, Power being changed, the changeful people went, And from the noisome pit where he was pent Drew forth blind Isaac. Seven black years of night Clung to him, and kept him cold in the sun's light. For he had grown to hold familiar talk With newts and creeping things,—long wont to walk About him in the silent dark down there, Which he would miss henceforth. He was aware Of little else. And it was hard to him To understand (so very faint and dim To his dull memory were the former times) Why the great world, intent upon its crimes And pleasures, was at pains to take him back Unto itself, from that oblivion black, Where he, the loveless man of long ago, Had learn'd to love, what men abhor—the slow Soft-footed dwellers of the dark. He had So lost the habitude of being glad, And all the strength of it, that, tho' thrice o'er New friends explain'd to him his joy, no more Than one born deaf and dumb he seem'd to find A meaning to the matter in his mind. So, passively, he yielded to the crowd That robed him, crown'd him, and proclaim'd aloud Him only the true Cæsar. VI.TWO BLIND MEN. Now once more Proud to up-prop all Power, those lions four, Subservient, their broad blazing backs upon The bright floor crouch, beneath the throne whereon Blind Isaac sits; with fumbling hand, in dull Delaying doubt, to affix the golden bull And great sign manual, by the Barons claim'd, To that high treaty with Alexius framed In Zara. Which to place in those weak hands, Blind Dandalo before blind Isaac stands. Two grey old men, and sightless each. The one Sits robed in royal state on sumptuous throne, Distinguisht by the imperial diadem And purple mantle proud with many a gem; And sees them not: but, in himself, doth gaze On darkness, gloomy death, and guilty days. The other, by long noble labours marr'd, With august brows by battle thunder scarr'd, Stands,—mark'd to sight by honourable soils Of his yet recent self-regardless toils; And sees them not: but, in himself, doth see The bright beginnings of great days to be, And glory never dying. VII.THE DOGE IS OBSTINATE. After this, In the Cathedral (as old custom is) On battle shield, in purple buskins, borne, And vermeil robe, by new-made Cæsars worn, The young Alexius, in full pomp and state Of sovran power, supreme beneath the great Imperial ensign's eagle wings unfurl'd, Receives high homage of one half a world. Which things accomplisht; and a month or more Of pageant and carousal being o'er (Whose swiftly-sliding and soft-footed hours Slipp'd unsuspected by, mid myrtle bowers, From porphyry palaces) the Red Cross lords, Yawning, with listless looks down their long swords, As banquet after banquet pall'd on them, Cry . . . “Now for Joppa and Jerusalem!” The new-made Emperor still their presence prays And added aid, with promised guerdon: says Need yet remains to heal by wholesome arts The much-hurt empire,—all the popular parts Bind up in single, and compact the state; Which tasks more time: hints vaguely hindrance great; Claims to appease, and scruples nice to weigh; Funds hard to find; grave causes for delay; With promise fair of further profit still, Thereby implied. “The Treaty, sign'd, fulfil First, Emperor of the East,” said Dandalo. VIII.VERTIGO. Alas, that in this world 'tis ever so! For men might be as gods, if it were not That greed of power goes mad from power got. Who stands upon the pinnacle, as 'twere, Of Greatness,—seeing, hearing, everywhere About himself the dazzling orb spin round, Turns dizzy at the sight and at the sound, And tumbles from the top to the abyss. Of all high places this the danger is:— —That those who stand there needs must gaze beneath, Till they wax desperate; being wooed to death By depth; from whose black clutch some point of sight Above them seen, if such there were,—some height Higher than theirs,—whereon to fix their eyes, Might haply save them. But this Heaven denies. And, seeing that, of Emperors and Kings, The Scribe of Judgment (who plucks out his wings To write their histories o'er and o'er again, Leaving meanwhile the lives of meaner men To kind oblivion) doth record to us So many monsters, so few virtuous, What wonder if some weary souls suppose That 'tis perchance the thing itself (who knows?) Time cannot cure: the nature of the thing, Not of the man: the kingship, not the king? Howe'er that be, Alexius, now made strong By rights restored, forthwith wax'd weak by wrong Renew'd: and palter'd both with his allies And with his people; teasing each with lies, And fronting bothways with a double face. Thus, since, with reason shrewd, the populace Look'd coldly, and askance, on power restored By foreign arms, the frighten'd Prince ignored Those foreign friends to whom he owed his throne: Carp'd at their claims, and did his oath disown. For heedless Hope in misery oft is fain To mortgage more of gratitude for gain Than, in possession, frugal Memory yields Her clamorous claimant, from full harvest fields. But since, withal, he fear'd the people too, He plotted still, and still desired (untrue To all alike) by foreign arms kept still Still, too, to keep in check the people's will. Till foes, thus finding friends in friends turn'd foes, Said, “Power is powerless.” IX.A DARK DEED. Then one night uprose Myrtillus, the one-eyebrow'd, in the dark (Mark'd out for mischief by the devil's mark Across his squinting double-minded eyes) And seized on the Boy-Emperor by surprise And treason foul, in unsuspecting sleep; Whom, having plunged him down a dungeon deep, Six times with hell-brew'd hebanon he tried To poison. But the Prince, because he died That way too slowly, being young and hard Of life, 'tis said, was strangled afterward. No need to strangle Isaac. Soon as told Of what was done, he did his mantle fold Across his brows, and said, “This was to be Because of my great sins that follow me.” And that same night he died. The morrow morn, On battle shield, in purple buskins, borne, Myrtillus men crown'd Emperor. X.THE FULNESS OF TIME. Dandalo Said then . . . . “The time is come, which long ago I saw in Zara. Who eschew the good Must choose the evil. Drunk with brawl and blood, This Empire reels upon her downward road; Corrupt at home, contemptible abroad. Devilish, she would be godlike without God: Godless, would rule, who needs, herself, the rod: And deems, not being good, she can be great: —Great, without one great man, i' the face of Fate! The singular tyrant breeds the general slave, And shameless citizens shamed cities have. The time is now, and ours the hands, O friends, To sweep this rubbish hence, and make amends To earth, too long encumber'd with the same. —To arms, for all men's sake, and in God's name!” So, down before the iron Occident The guilty golden-crownèd Orient went. Because those Powers that make, and break, and keep, And cast away—Spirits that in the deep And toilful stithy of that underground Grey miner, Nature, with unheeded sound Monotonously hammer, heave, and beat, And bend with blow on blow, and heat on heat, The pliant world to every shape it wears, Upon the stubborn anvils of the years— —Said to each other “Break we up this Past!” And suddenly one half a world was cast Into the furnace, to be forged anew. XI.THE HORSES OF LYSIPPUS. At midnight, in the murtherous streets, the dew Was blood-red, and the heavens were hurt with sound Of shriek and wail the ransack'd region round. So that men heard not, in the Hippodrome, Those Four Bronze Horses, that had come from Rome, In conference, talking each to each. One said “Our purple-mantled master, Power, is fled. And how shall We Four fare? Let us away Thro' the thick night! For ever since the day We follow'd that great Western Cæsar home To grace the glories of Augustine Rome, We Four have felt no hand upon our manes Less great than theirs, who grasp the golden reins Of Empire; they behind whose chariot wheel Yet-burning ruts their fervid course reveal, Who rode the rolling world. We also, when Power pass'd from Rome, his car drew here again, And carried Conquest in his course divine From West to East, to dwell with Constantine. But now is Power departed, who knows where? Out of the East!” So spake that voice in air. The others answer'd “Whither shall we go? Our master being gone? For who doth know Where we may find him?” XII.AND THE LION OF ST. MARK. Listening in the dark, To these replied the Lion of St. Mark. “Power rideth on my wings. Come also ye Whither I go, across the vassal sea. And let us bear with us, to please him well, Beauty, the spouse of Power. And we will dwell Together.” Then they answer'd “Even so, Lion! and where thou goest, we will go.” So those Five Beasts went forth. And took with them Power, and Beauty. For whose diadem They also brought great store of precious things, And gather'd graven gems in golden rings, And carved and colour'd stones, to be the dower Of Beauty and the heritage of Power: Clear agate cups and vases crystalline, Porphyry, and syenite, and serpentine, Obsidion, alabaster: statues fair Of lucid gods: garments of richness rare: And gold, and bronze, and silver: turkis blue As Venus' veins: and rubies red in hue As Adon's lips: and jasper, onyx, opal. In this way Venice took Constantinople. END OF BOOK VI.</field>

(ELEVENTH CENTURY.) 1 In woeful plight, a piteous sight, The Exarch was that day We Venice men sat round to hear The tale he came to say. 2 ‘The Greek hath lost, with little cost The Lombard he hath won To the iron crown, the stoutest town That stands beneath the sun: 3 ‘For, while the old wolf Luitprand Was fighting for the Franks, His wily nephew Hildebrand, Among whose robber ranks 4 ‘Vicenza's Duke rode unabash'd, Hath seized Ravenna town, And from the Imperial city dash'd The Imperial standard down.’ 5 A joyful man the Exarch was The morrow of that day We Venice men set sail again To seize the Lombard's prey. 6 At close of day Ravenna lay Before us on the height: We dropp'd adown beneath the town After the fall of night: 7 At fall of night there was no light, There was no noise of bells: Without a sound we ran aground, And fix'd our mangonels: 8 At mid of night was sound and light Thro' all Ravenna town: Loud rang the bells above the yells Of thousands trampled down: 9 At ope of day in fetters lay The Lombard Hildebrand: The town was ours: about the towers We roam'd, a merry band. 10 The fight, God wot, was short and hot. “Bear Hildebrand aboard. Renew your oath,” Doge Orso quoth, “And take your lawful lord. 11 “The Duke is dead,” he laughed, and said “The city is all our own. Stand forth Exarch! To thee Saint Mark Gives back Ravenna town.” 12 Then all outright for great delight The Exarch wept, I trow. As he had woeful been before, So was he joyful now. 13 By that night's cost the Lombard lost, What our Duke Orso won With great renown, the stoutest town That stands beneath the sun. SALZBURGENSIS VAGABUNDUS. (THIRTEENTH CENTURY.) Pax Dei vobiscum! We are, by your leave, friends, Three poor travelling scholars. All the more we grieve, friends, That now-a-days good wine's so dear, and learning still so cheap, alas! O ghost of good Archbishop Reinhold, you for us would weep Alas! But you have left this wicked world, and you are gone to glory. Mihi est propositum in tabernâ mori! All the way from Salzburg here, in this season blowy, Bitter blue the hill tops were, bleak the roads and snowy. Sure, a man must warm his wits when the weather pinches, And the snow's above his boots some half dozen inches!

Snug as hedgehog hid in hedge, most comfortably curl'd up, And looking not a whit less proud than if it wrapp'd the world up, Safe upon the mountain side, secured from all infraction, And reckless how the plain may fare, in high self-satisfaction Smiled this blessèd burg;—resolved we three should make a climb of it, And cool as Lot's small city when the rest had a hot time of it. ‘Vides,’ then ‘ut altâ’ . . . there . . . ‘stet nive’ . . . shouted Hax to us, And Fritz . . . ‘'Tis not good wine, I trust, the little city lacks!’ to us. ‘Deprome,’ then, ‘quadrimum,’ I . . . so here we are among you, Praying the Lord, good gentlefolks, your good lives to prolong you!

WILLIAM OF LORIS TO THE LADY OF THE ROSE. 1 Rise, my Queen, and away with me! From the kingdoms where I am King Two Spirits to lead me to thee Have outspeeded the wild bird's wing. 2 For the sake of thy dear dark eyes My soul have I given this Twain; Who are pledged to win me the prize I die if I do not obtain: 3 Yet they are not Spirits accurst, But each is a delicate Sprite: And Sleep is the name of the first, The name of the second is Night. 4 O hearken! O hearken! Our horses Are waiting for thee and for me. More fleet than the wind in his courses, More strong than the hurricanes be, 5 They shall bear us, nor ever tire, Over hollow, and hill, and stream: The name of the one is Desire, The name of the other is Dream. 6 Away! I am thine, thou art mine: One body, and spirit, and heart! Stoop! midsummer leaps in the wine I pour to thee, ere we depart. 7 List! midsummer melodies stray From the strings of my throbbing lute, With music to lead us away Thro' the dim world starry and mute! 8 The lute is of fanciful fashion, The wine strong, and tender, and bright: And the name of the wine is Passion, The name of the lute is Delight. 9 On the strand is anchor'd my boat: It is built to live in all seas: We have but to set it afloat, It will bear us far as we please: 10 For it is so light that, in sooth, 'Twill sink not, tho' loaded with treasures: The name of the helmsman is Youth, The crew that he pilots are Pleasures. 11 But linger not now, for 'tis late, And we have the world to go thro'. Poor world! 'tis in such a sad state, It surely hath need of us two; 12 So much that needs setting to rights! Hate, massacre, murder, and war .... But ... how sweet are these midsummer nights! Shall we let things rest as they are? 13 At least we must travel in state, Since a king and a queen are we: And scatter our largesse, elate And lavish as monarchs should be. 14 Before us our herald shall go: And their gates all cities shall ope, When his clarion he doth blow, For our herald his name is Hope: 15 Our almoner cometh behind, And he singeth a saintly hymn: He is wealthy, and wise, and kind, Gentle Memory men call him. 16 To the sweet, the afar, the unseen, Fair, joyous, majestic, and free, Lead by Sleep and by Night, my Queen, Away, through the world, now, with me! 17 And the world shall do us sweet duty, As royally thro' it we move: For thou art a queen—thou art Beauty, And I am a king—I am Love! FAIR YOLAND WITH THE YELLOW HAIR. I. A knight that wears no lady's sleeve Upon his helm from dawn to eve, And all night long beneath the throng Of throbbing stars, without reprieve My moan I make, as on I ride Along waste lands and waters wide, The haunts of bitterns; smoky strips Of sea-coast where there come no ships; Or over brambly hump-back'd downs, And under walls of hilly towns, And out again across the plain, Oft borne beneath a hissing rain Within the murmurs of the wind, That doth at nightfall leave his lair To follow and vex me; till I find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair. II. On a field azure, all pure or, A fountain springing evermore To reach one star that, just too far For its endeavour, trembles o'er The topmost spray its strength will yield, For my device upon my shield Long since I wrought; and under it Along a scroll of flame is writ The legend, thus ... “I shall attain.” In letters large: albeit “In vain!” My heart replies to mock mine eyes; For where that fountain seems to rise Its highest, it is back consign'd To earth, and falls in void despair, Like my sad seven-years' hope to find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair. III. Seven years ago (how long it seems Since then!) as free as summer streams My fancy play'd with sun and shade, And all my days were dim with dreams. One day—I wot not whence nor how It flash'd upon me—even now I marvel at the change it wrought! My whole life leapt into one thought, Which thought was made my lifelong act; As, dash'd in dazzling cataract, From its long sleeps, at last outleaps Some lazy ooze, which henceforth keeps One steadfast way; so all my mind Was in that moment made aware That henceforth I must die, or find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair. IV. Since then, how many lands and climes Have I ransack'd—how many times Been bruised with blows—how many foes Have dealt to death—how many crimes Avenged—how many maidens freed! And yet I seem to be, indeed, No nearer to the endless quest. Neither by night nor day I rest: My heart burns in me like a fire: My soul is parch'd with long desire: Ghostlike I grow: and where I go, I hear men mock and mutter low And feel men's fingers point behind— “The moon-struck knight that talks to air! Lord help the fool who hopes to find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair!” V. At times, in truth, I start, and shake Myself from thought, as one men wake From some long trance to hard mischance, Who knows not yet what choice to make 'Twixt false and true, since all things seem Mere fragments of his broken dream, When I recal what men aver, That all my lifelong quest of her Is vain and void; since thrice (say they) Three hundred years are rolled away, And knights forgot, whose bones now rot, And their good deeds remember'd not, Fail'd one by one, long ere I pined For this strange quest; whence they declare No living wight may hope to find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair. VI. Ah me! ... For Launcelot maketh cheer With great-eyed, glorious Guinevere; In glad green wood; with Queen Isoud Tristram of Lyones hunts the deer; In cool of bloomy trellises Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris, After long labours brought to end, With their two dames in joyance spend The blue June hours; Sir Agravaine With Dame Laurell along the main Seeks his new home; and Pelleas Sits smiling calm in halls of glass At Nimuë's knees. Good knights be these Because they have their hearts at ease, Because their lives and loves are joined: O if two hearts in one life were, What life were that! ... God let me find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair! VII. Mere life is vile. I may have done Deeds not unworthy, and have won Unwilling fame; tho' all men blame This heart's unrest which makes me shun The calm content that good men take From good deeds done for good deeds' sake, Deeds that in doing of the deed Do bless the doer, who should need No bliss beyond: but what to me Is this,—that over land and sea My name should fly? Or what care I, For the mere sake of climbing high, To climb for ever steps that wind Up empty towers? I only wear Life hollow thus, unless I find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair. VIII. Sometimes, whom I to free from wrong Have dragons fought, strange folk do throng About my steed, and lightly lead My horse and me, with shout and song, In banner'd castle-courts; and there From chambers cool come dames most fair, Whose forms as thro' a cloud I see; Whose voices seem far off to be; Tho' near they stand, and bid me rest Awhile within, where, richly drest, In order stored, with goblets poured, I see the sparkling banquet-board; But far from these is all my mind, For ... “What if foes, whom I must scare, In noisome den now seek to bind Fair Yoland with the yellow hair?” IX. In deepest dark, when no moon shines Thro' the blind night on the black pines With bony boughs, if I, to drouse (As sometimes mere despair inclines A frame outworn) should slip from horse, And lay me down along the gorse, In some cold hollow far away A little while—albeit I pray Ere I lie down—my dreams are drear: First comes a slowly-creeping fear, Like icy dew, that seems to glue My limbs to earth, and freeze them thro', Then a long shriek on a wild wind, And “O,” I think, “if her's it were, And I a murder'd corpse should find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair!” X. Sometimes 'neath dropping white rose-leaves I ride, and under gilded eaves Of garden bowers where, plucking flowers, With scarlet skirts and stiff gold sleeves, Between green walls, and two by two, Kings' daughters walk, whilst just a few Faint harps make music mild, that falls Like mist from off the ivied walls Along the sultry corn, and stirs The hearts of far-off harvesters; Then, on the brink of hope, I shrink With shuddering strange, the while I think “O what if, after body and mind Consumed in toil, and all my care, Not a corpse, but a bride, I find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair?” XI. But when at night's most lonely noon, The ghost of an ill-buried moon Frets in the shroud of a cold cloud, And, like the echo of a tune, Within mine ear the silence makes A yearning sound that throbs and aches, A whisper sighs ... “The grave is deep, There is no better thing than sleep. Life's fever speeds its own decease, Let the mole work: be thou at peace.” Yet why should this fair earth, which is So fair, so fit to furnish bliss, Prove a mere failure—stuff design'd By Hope to clothe her foe Despair? And whence, if vain, this need to find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair? XII. This grieving after unknown good, Though but a sickness in the blood, Cries from the dust. And God is just. No rock denies the raven food. For who would torture, night by night, Some starving creature with the sight Of banquets fair with plenty spread, Then mock ... “crawl empty thou to bed, “And dream of viands not for thee!” Yet night by night, dear God, to me, In wake or sleep, such visions creep To gnaw my heart with hunger deep. How can I meet dull death, resign'd To die the fool of dreams so fair? Nay, love hath seen, and life shall find, Fair Yoland with the yellow hair! XIII. Good Pilgrim, to whatever shrine, With whatsoever vows of thine, Thou wendest, stay! I charge thee, pray That God may bless this quest of mine. Sweet maidens, whom from losel hands Mine own have freed—in many lands, I bid you each, when ye shall be With your good knights, remember me! And wish me well,—that some day I May find fair Yoland; else I die In love's defeat. To die were sweet, If, dying, I might clasp her feet. Death comes at last to all mankind; Yet ere I die, I know not where, I know not how, but I must find Fair Yoland with the yellow hair. TRIAL BY COMBAT. The doleful wind around around The turret, trying to enter here, Whines low, while down in the court-yard drear The great bloodhound, to the flint fast bound, Is baying the moon. The moon is clear And dismal-cold: because a Fear, Whose cat'sfoot falls with no more sound Than an eyelid that sinks on a sick man's swound, Is lord of her light; whereby tonight He walketh alone on the frozen mere From the wood whence he cometh anear,—anear! Ever, about the setting in Of the darkness, now for a month or more, The things on the gusty arras 'gin To rustle and creep and mope and grin At me, still sitting as heretofore This last sad night (no whit less calm Than when first he accused me a month before) With elbow based on knee, and palm Upslanted, propping a moody chin; The better to watch with a glassy eye The dull red embers drop, and lie Forlorn of a lurid inner light, Like days burn'd out by a deadly sin. I marvel much if my mind be right, All seems so wondrous calm within This long o'er-laboured heart, in spite Of the howling wind and the hideous night, And to-morrow that bringeth the final fight When all is to lose or win. What matter the end, so it be near? I can only think of how last year We rode together, she and I: She in scarlet and I in green, Across the oak-wood dark and high, Whose wicked leaves shut out the sky; Which, had I seen, that had not been, I think, which makes me fear to die And meet her there. I could not bear Her dead face e'en. Who else, I ween, Should hardly shrink from Conrad's eye, For all his vaunting, not so keen, The too-soon boasting braggart (ay Even when he strode before the Queen, And three times charged me with the lie!) As my keen axe. More glad that day She was, sure, than 'tis good to be, Lest some, that cannot be so glad As she was then, should chance go mad, Trying to laugh. Oh, all the way She laughed so loud that even the wood Laugh'd too. She seem'd so sure, that day, That life is sweet and God is good. I could not laugh; because her hood Had fallen back, and so let stray Of all her long hair's loveliness A single shining yellow tress Across her shoulder; which made me (That could not choose, poor fool! but see) More sad, I think, than men should be When women laugh. The wood, I say, Laugh'd with her, at me, all the way. Once, too, her palfrey, while we rode, Started aside, and in alarm She lean'd her hand upon my arm; Whose light touch did so overload My heavy heart, that I believe, Had she a moment longer so Lean'd on me, from my saddle-bow I must have dropped down dead. Near eve We came out on the other land. And I remember that I said, “How still and lone the land is here!” She only look'd, and shook her head, And, looking, laugh'd still louder, and Said, laughing loudly, “What's to fear?” The accursèd echo, that low lay Under that lonesome land, I knew, For want of aught more wise to say, Shriek'd “Fear!” and fell a-laughing too. Deep melancholy meadow-grass, Which never any man had mown, So long our horses scarce could pass Thro' the thick-heap'd unheaving mass Of heavy stalks, by no breath blown Of any wind, all round was grown, For some bad purpose of its own, Up to the edge of the grey sky. And underneath a stream ran by: A little stream, that made great moan, Half mad with pain, the Fiend knows why: 'Twixt stupid heaps of helpless stone, That chose upon its path to lie Unreasonably, purpose none Subserving (there resolved to stay For spite's sake, with nor use nor grace) It push'd and dash'd at desperate pace, In extreme haste to get away. The owls might fly about by day, For all the sky, there, had to say; Which took no care to change its face To any other hue but grey, Having to light up such a place. But for the moan of that mad stream All things were dumb, resign'd, and still, And strange, as things are in a dream. The whole land self-surrender'd lay, And let harsh Nature work her will, For lack of strength to answer nay To any sort of wrong or ill That chose to vex it. Laughing gay Into that lonesome land rode she. The grass above her palfrey's knee Was long and green as green could be. She, laughing as she rode, 'gan trill Some canzonet or virelay; It matter'd little, good or ill, Whate'er the song, if any way It eased her heart of laughter shrill. Of trees were only blackthorns three, Low-clump'd upon the ugly hill, Like witches when, to watch the weather, They crook their backs and squat together. We 'lighted down beneath those trees Whereto did I our horses tether; And on a bough I hung my shield. She went up higher in the field, And down her long limbs laid at ease In the deep grass; which up and down, Wave after wave of green, heaved over Her bright gold-border'd scarlet gown; And all but her small face did cover. For now, out of some land unshown Behind the grassy upland, low A little wind began to blow Faintly, and the dull air was strown With a moist sickly scent of clover. She, slanted o'er her propping arm, Look'd smiling sideways with a charm To catch me; while, now forwards, now Backwards, she swung with saucy brow Her gold curls, like a gorgeous snake That lifts and leans on lolling fold A lustrous head, but half awake From winter dreams when, coy and cold, Spring stirs about the rustling brake. She call'd me to her thro' the grass: She call'd me “Friend:” she said I was “Her Ritter of the rueful face: But I,” she said, “am never sad.” Therewith she laugh'd. The hateful place Laugh'd too: resolved to make me mad. I went, and sat beside her there, And gazed upon her glittering hair. Musing, I said, “Twill soon be night; Night must be very lonely here.” She look'd at me, and laugh'd outright, And, laughing, answer'd, “What's to fear?” But “Fear!” the echo, laughing light, Still added. It was hard to bear. Long sat I silent in her sight, Much musing. When I spoke at last It may have been that all I said Marr'd all I meant—for there was pass'd Like burning lead, about my head And on my brain, a heavy pain, And “Oh,” I cried, “if it would rain, And bring some change!”—Yet this I know, That, soon as I had ended, she Look'd thro' her glittering hair at me, Full in my face, and laugh'd again, And answered “Never! let this be A thing forgot between us twain.” So, back beneath the black-thorn tree, Where my shield hung, I went away A little while, and sat apart. I could not speak: I could not pray: I thought it was because my heart Was in my throat—it choked me so! But now the devil's claw, I know, It was, that would not let me go; Me by the throat so fast he had. Enough! You think that I went mad? By no means. I grew strong and wise, Went back, look'd boldly in her eyes, And stopp'd her laughing. It was she, Not I, that trembled. I could see The woman was afraid of me. What wonder? I myself had been Already, such a woeful long Wild while (even ere he wax'd thus strong, And let his wicked face be seen) Afraid, too, of the fiend within My heart; whereof she was the Queen, Feeding him with the food of sin, Forbidden beauty. Then I knew That she was all mine thro' and thro', Whatever I might choose to do. Mine, from the white brow's hiding-place Under the roots of golden hair That glitter'd round her frighten'd face; Mine, from the warmth and odour there Down to the tender feet that were Mine too to guess in each great fold Of scarlet bound about with gold. So I grew dainty with my pleasure; And, as a miser counts the treasure His heart is loth to spend too fast, So did mine eye take note and measure Of all my new-gain'd wealth. At last The Fiend, impatient to be gone, Brought this to end. When all was done, I seem'd to know what was to be, And how 'twould fare henceforth with me, Who must ride home now all alone: I knew that I should never see The face of God, nor ever hear Her laugh again. And so it was. Yet 'twas not mine, that blow, I swear. Nor did I know it, till the grass Was red and wet. When Conrad tries To charge me with that deed, he lies! And lies! and lies! Who could have guess'd That she had hidden in her breast, Or in her girdle (what know I?), A dagger? Did she mean to die Always,—even when she seem'd so proud, So sure of life? Ay, when so loud She laugh'd that day? I only know I would have given these two hands, The moment I beheld her so, Ay, all my lordships, all my lands, If but on me had fall'n that blow, Not her. Oh what were Hell's worst pain If I might hear her laugh again? It must have been an hour or more I think (it seem'd long years) before I, sitting there beside her still, And listening, heard a sound of rain In the three black-thorns on the hill. “Too late it comes,” I thought, “and vain, For nothing here will change now.” Chill The evening grew. A wet wind blew About the billowy grass. A few Large drops fell sullenly. I thought “How cold she will be here all night In this wet meadow!” Then I caught (For by this time her lips were white, Not red; nor warm, but rigid quite) At the tall grass, and heap'd and mass'd Great handfuls of it, which I cast Over her feet, and on her face; But first drew down her scarlet gown Over her limbs composed and meek In great calm folds; and, o'er her cheek, Smooth'd the bright hair; and all the place Where the black redness oozed, I hid With heaps of grass. All this I did Quite quietly, as a mother might Put her sick child to sleep. 'T was night Ere I had ended. A dull moon Across the smearing rain reveal'd A melancholy light, and soon Began to peer about the field To find what still the fresh grass kept Well hidden. Then I think I crept Down to the little stream; and stood A long while looking at the wood, Wondering what ever I should do. There was a spot of blood I knew Upon my hand. I did not dare To wash it, lest the water there Too far away the stain should bear, And so make all the world aware Of what was done. The cock crows—hark! Before his time, sure. Deep in dark The drowsy land is lying yet. Yon frosty cloud hides up the moon, But I am sure she is not set. To-morrow? Is it come so soon? Well, let it come! A hundred eyes Can make no worse the eyes I scorn. For in his throat Count Conrad lies, And on his body am I sworn To prove the same this very morn. Let Kaiser Henry range his state; To mark the issue of my fate, The lords of every Landgravate From Rhine to Rhone, with looks elate, Like gods between the earth and sky, May crowd each golden balcony. Come, Kaiser, call the fight! Let the great trumpet blare on high As tho' the Judgment Angel blew The blast that bids the wicked rue; Now, Conrad, to the lists, and smite Thy very worst! I reck not, I, Not tho' the dead should come to sight, Nor tho' a hundred heralds cry, “On! God maintain the right!” RABBI BEN EPHRAIM'S TREASURE. PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS IN SPAIN. (FIFTEENTH CENTURY.) I. The days of Rabbi Ben Ephraim Were two score years and ten, the day The hangman call'd at last for him, And he privily fled from Cordova. Drop by drop, he had watch'd the cup Of the wine of bitterness fill'd to the brim; Drop by drop, he had drain'd it up; And the time was an evil time for him. An evil time! For Jehovah's face Was turn'd in wrath from His chosen race, And the daughter of Judah must mourn, Whom His anger had left, in evil case, To be dogg'd by death from place to place, With garments bloody and torn. The time of the heavy years, from of old By the mouth of His servant the Prophet foretold, In the days of Josiah the king, When the Lord upon Jacob his load should bring, And the hand of Heaven, in the day of His ire, Be heavy and hot upon son and sire, Till from out of the holes into which they were driven Their bones should be strown to the host of Heaven Whose bodies were burn'd in the fire. Rabbi Ben Ephraim, day by day (As the hangman, beating up his bounds Thro' the stifled Ghetto's sinks and stews, Or the Arch Inquisitor, going his rounds, Was pleased to pause, and pick, and choose, —Too sure of his game, which could not stray, To miss the luxury of delay) Had mark'd with a moody indignation The abomination of desolation, With the world to witness, and none to gainsay, Set up in the midst of the Holy Nation, And the havoc, which Heaven refused to stay, In the course of his horrible curse move on, Where, sometimes driven in trembling crews, Sometimes singly one by one, Israel's elders were beckon'd away To the place where the Christians burn the Jews: Till he, because that his wealth was known, And because the king had debts to pay, Was left, at the last, almost alone Of all his people in Cordova, A living man picked out by fate To bear, and beware of, the daily jibe, And add the same to the sum of the hate, Made his on behalf of a slaughter'd tribe. II. In the gloomy Ghetto's gloomiest spot, A certain patch of putrid ground, There is a place of tombs: Moors rot, Rats revel there, and devils abound By night, no cross being there to keep The evil things in awe: the dead That house there, sleep no Christian sleep— They do not sleep at all, it is said; Tho' how they fare, the Fiend best knows, Who never vouchsafes to them any repose, For their worm is awake in the narrow bed, And the fire that will never be quench'd is fed On the night that will never close. There did Rabbi Ben Ephraim (When he saw, at length, the appointed measure Of misery meted out to him) Bury his books, and all his treasure. Books of wisdom many a one— All the teaching of all the ages, All the learning under the sun, Learn'd by all the Hebrew sages To Eliphaz from Solomon; Not to mention the mystic pages Of Nathan the son of Shimeon The Seer, which treat of the sacred use Of the number Seven (quoth the Jews “A secret sometime filch'd from us By one call'd Apollonius”), The science of the even and odd, The signs of the letters Aleph and Jod, And the seven magical names of God. Furthermore, he laid in store Many a vessel of beaten ore, Pure, massy, rich with rare device Of Florence-work wrought under and o'er, Shekels of silver, and stones of price, Sardius, sapphire, topaz, more In number than may well be told, Milan stuffs, and merchandise Of Venice, the many times bought and sold. He buried them deep where none might mark —Hid them from sight of the hated race, Gave them in guard of the Powers of the Dark And solemnly set his curse on the place. Then he saddled his mule, and with him took Zillah his wife, and Rachel his daughter, And Manassah his son; and turn'd and shook The dust from his foot on the place of slaughter, And cross'd the night, and fled away (Balking the hangman of his prey) From out of the city of Cordova. III. Rabbi Ben Ephraim never more Saw Cordova. For the Lord had will'd That the dust should be dropp'd on his eyes before The curse upon Israel was fulfill'd. Therefore he ended the days of his life In evil times; and by the hand Of Rachel his daughter, and Zillah his wife, Was laid to rest in another land. But, before his face to the wall he turn'd, As the eyes of the women about his bed Grew hungry and hard with a hope unfed, And the misty lamp more misty burn'd, To Zillah and Rachel the Rabbi said Where they might find, if fate turn'd kind, And the fires in Cordova, grown slack, Should ever suffer their footsteps back, The tomb where by stealth he had buried his wealth In the evil place, when in dearth and lack He fled from the foe, and the stake, and the rack; IV. “A strand of colours, clear to be seen By the main black cord of it twined between The scarlet, the golden, and the green: All the length of the Moorish wall the line Runs low with his mystic serpent-twine, Until he is broken against the angle Where thin grizzled grasses dangle Like dead men's hairs, from the weeds that clot The scurfy side of a splinter'd pot, Upon the crumbled cornice squat, Gaping, long-ear'd, in his hue and shape Like a Moor's head cut off at the nape. The line, till it touches the angle follow, Take pebbles then in the hand and drop Stone after stone till the ground sounds hollow. Thence walk left, till there starts, to stop Your steps, a thorn-tree with an arm Stretch'd out as tho' some mad alarm Had seized upon it from behind. It points the way until you find A flat square stone, with letters cut. Stoop down to lift it, 'twill not move, More than you move a mountain, but Upon the letter which is third Of seven in the seventh word Press with a finger, and you shove Its weight back softly, as the South Turns a dead rose lightly over: Back falls it, and there yawns earth's mouth; Wherein the treasure is yet to discover, By means of a spiral cut down the abyss To the dead men.” V. When he had utter'd this Rabbi Ben Ephraim turn'd his face, And slept. VI. The years went on apace. Manassah his son, his youngest born, Trading the isleted sea for corn, Was wreck'd and pick'd up by the smuggler boat Of a certain prowling Candiote; And, being young and hale, was sold By the Greek a bondsman to the Turk. Zillah, his wife, wax'd white and old. Rachel, his daughter, loved not work, But walk'd by the light of her own dark eyes In wicked ways for the sake of gain. Meanwhile, Israel's destinies Survived the scorching stake, and Spain At length grew weary of burning men; When hunger'd, and haggard, and gaunt, these two Forlorn Jew women crept again Into Cordova; because they knew Where Rabbi Ben Ephraim by stealth, When he turn'd his back on his own house-door, Had buried the whole of his wondrous wealth In the evil place; and they two were poor. VII. So poor indeed, they had been constrain'd To filch from the refuse flung out to the streets ('Mid the rags and onion-peelings rain'd Where the town's worst gutter's worst filth greets With his strongest gust and most savoury sweets Those blots and failures of Human Nature, Refused a name in her nomenclature, That spawn themselves toward night, and bend To finger the husks and shucks heap'd there,) The wretched, rat-bitten candle-end Which, found by good luck, they had treasured with care Not a whit less solemn than tho' it were That famous work of the son of Uri, The candlestick of candlesticks, —He the long-lost light of Jewry, Whose almond bowls and scented wicks Were the boast of the desert, and Salem's glory Of the knops and flowers, with his branches six! For this impov'rish'd, curtail'd, flaw'd, Maltreated, worried, gnaw'd and claw'd Remnant of what perchance made bright Once, for laughter and delight, Some chamber gay, with arras hung, Whose marbles, mirrors, and flowers among A lover, his lady's lute above, To a dear dark-eyelash'd listener sung Of the flame of a never-dying love, —Little heeding, meanwhile, the fitful spite Of the night-wind's mad and mocking sprite, Which stealthily in at the lattice sprung, And was wrying the taper's neck apace,— Must now, with its hungry half-starved light, Make bold the shuddering flesh to face The sepulchre's supernatural night, And the Powers of the Dark keeping guard on the place. VIII. And, when to the place of tombs they came, The spotted moon sunk. Night stood bare In the waste unlighted air Wide-arm'd, waiting, and aware, To horribly hem them in. The flame The little candle feebly gave, As it wink'd and winced from grave to grave, Went fast to furious waste; the same As a fever-famisht human hope That is doom'd, from grief to grief, to grope On darkness blind to a doubtful goal, And, sway'd by passion here and there In conflict with some vast despair, Consumes the substance of the soul In wavering ways about the world. The deep enormous night unfurl'd Her banner'd blackness left and right, Fold heap'd on fold, to mock such light With wild defiance; no star pearl'd The heavy pall, but horror hurl'd Shadow on shadow; while for spite The very graves kept out of sight, And heaven's sworn hatred, winning might From earth's ill-will, with darkness curl'd Darkness, all space confounding quite, So to engender night on night. IX. “Rachel, Rachel, for ye are tall, Lift the light along the wall.” “Mother, mother, give me the hand, And follow!” “What see ye, Rachel?” X. A strand Of chorded colours, clear to be seen By the main black dominant, twined between The scarlet, the golden, and the green. XI. “Rachel, Rachel, ye walk so fast!” “Mother, the light will barely last.” “What see ye, Rachel?” XII. Things that dangle Hairy and grey o'er the wall's choked angle From something dull, in hue and shape Like a Moor's head cut off at the nape. XIII. “Once! twice! thrice! ... the earth sounds hollow. Mother, give me the hand, and follow.” “Rachel, the flame is backward blowing, Pusht by the darkness. Where are we going? The ground is agroan with catacombs! What see ye, Rachel?” XIV. Yonder comes A thorn-tree with a desperate arm Flung out fierce in wild alarm Of something which, it madly feels, The night to plague it yet conceals. No help it gets tho'! An owl dash'd out Of the darkness, steering his ghostliness thither, Pry'd in at the boughs, and pass'd on with a shout From who-knows-whence to who-knows-whither: The unquiet Spirit abroad on the air Moved with a moan that way, and spent A moment or more in the effort to vent On the tortured tree which he came to scare The sullen fit of his discontent; But, laughing low as he grew aware Of the long-already-imposed despair Of the terrified thing he had paused to torment, He pass'd, pursuing his purpose elsewhere, And follow'd the whim of his wicked bent: A rheumy glow-worm, come to peer Into the hollow trunk, crawl'd near, And glimmer'd awhile, but intense fear, Or tame connivance with something wrong Which the night was intending, quench'd ere long His lantern. Therefore the tree remains, For all its gestures void and vain, Which still at their utmost fail to explain Any natural cause for the terror that strains Each desperate limb to be freed and away, In sheer paralysis of dismay Struck stark,—and so, night's abject, stands. XV. “Mother, the candle is cowering low Beneath the night-gust: hoop both hands About the light, and stoop over, so The wind from the buffeted flame to shut, Lest at once in our eyes the darkness blow.” “What see ye, Rachel?” XVI. A square stone cut With letters. Thick the moss is driven Thro' the graver's work now blunt and blurr'd: There be seven words with letters seven: A finger-touch on the letter third Of seven in the seventh word, And the stone is heaved back: earth yawns and gapes: A cold strikes up the clammy dark, And clings: a spawn of vaporous shapes Floats out in films: a sanguine spark The taper spits: the snaky stair Gleams, curling down the abyss laid bare, Where Rabbi Ben Ephraim's treasure is laid. XVII. There, they sat them down awhile, With that terrible joy which cannot smile Because the heart of it is staid And stunn'd, as it were, by a too swift pace. And the wicked Presence abroad on the place So took them with awe that they rested afraid Almost to look into each other's face. Moreover, the nearness of what should change, Like a change in a dream, their lives for ever Into something suddenly bright and strange, Paused upon them, and made them shiver. The old woman mumbled at length: “I am old: I have no sight the treasure to find; I have no strength to rake the red gold; My hand is palsied, mine eye is blind, Child of my bosom, I dare not descend To the horrible pit!” And Rachel said: “I fear the darkness, I fear the dead; But the candle is burning fast to the end: We waste the time with words. Look here! There rests between us and the dark A few short inches.... Mother, mark The wasting taper! ... I should not fear Either the darkness or the dead, But for certain memories in my head Which daunt me.... We will go, we twain, Together.” The old woman cried again: “Child of my bosom, I will not descend To the horrible pit—and the candle-end Is burning down, God curse the same! I am old, and cannot help myself. Young are ye! What your beauty brings Who knows? I think ye keep the pelf. Ye will let me starve. So the serpent stings The bosom it lay in! Are ye so tame Of spirit? I marvel why we came. Poverty is the worst of things!” Rachel look'd at the dwindling flame, And frown'd, and mutter'd, “Mother, shame! I fear the darkness, because there clings To my heart a thought, I cannot smother, Of certain things which, whatever the blame, Thou wottest of, and I will not name; For my sins are many and heavy, mother. Yet because I hunger, and still would save Some years from sin, and because of my brother Whom the Greek man sold to be slave to a slave, (May the Lord requite the lying knave!) I will go down alone to the pit. Thou therefore, mother, watch, and sit In prayer for me, by the mouth of the grave. The light will hardly last me, I fear. And what is to do must be quickly done. —Mercy on us, mother! ... Look here Three inches more, and the light will be gone! Quick, mother, the candle—quick! I fear To be left in the darkness alone.” XVIII. The mother sat by the grave, and listen'd. She waited: she heard the footsteps go Under the earth, wandering, slow. She look'd: deep down the taper glisten'd. Then, the voice of Rachel from below: “Mother, mother, stoop and hold!” And she flung up four ouches of gold. The old woman counted them, ouches four, Beaten out of the massy ore. “Child of my bosom, blessèd art thou! The hand of the Lord be yet with thee! As thou art strong in thy spirit now, Many and pleasant thy days shall be. As a vine in a garden, fair to behold, Green in her branches, shalt thou grow, And so have gladness when thou art old. Rachel, Rachel, be thou bold! More gold yet, and still more gold!” “Mother, mother, the light burns low. The candle is one inch shorter now, And I dare not be left in the darkness alone.” “Rachel, Rachel, go on! go on! Of thee have I said, She shall not shrink! Thy brother is yet a bondsman—think! Yet once more,—and he is free. And whom shall he praise for this but thee? Rachel, Rachel, be thou bold! Manassah is groaning over the sea. More gold yet, and still more gold!” “Mother, mother, stoop and hold!” And she flung up from below again Cups of the carven silver twain. Solid silver was each great cup. The old woman caught them as they came up. “Rachel, Rachel, well hast thou done! Manassah is free. Go on! go on! Royal dainties for ever be thine! Rachel's eyes shall be red with wine, Rachel's mouth shall with milk be fill'd, And her bread be fat. I praise thee, my child, For surely thou hast freed thy brother. The deed was good, but there resteth another, And art thou not the child of thy mother? Once more, Rachel, yet once more! Thy mother is very poor and old. Must she close her eyes before They see the thing she would behold? More gold yet, and still more gold!” “Mother, the light is very low. The candle is well-nigh wasted now, And I dare not be left in the darkness alone.” “Rachel, Rachel, go on! go on! Much is done, but there resteth more. Ye are young, Rachel, shall it be told That my bones were laid at my children's door? More gold yet, and still more gold!” “Mother, mother, stoop and hold!” The voice came fainter from beneath; And she flung up a jewell'd sheath. The sheath was thick with many a gem; The old woman carefully counted them. “Rachel, Rachel, thee must I praise, Who makest pleasant thy mother's days. Blessèd be thou in all thy ways! Surely for this must I praise thee, my daughter, And therefore in fulness shalt thou dwell As a fruitful fig-tree beside the water That layeth her green leaves over the well. More gold, Rachel, yet again! And we shall have houses and servants in Spain, And thou shalt walk with the wealthiest ladies, And fairest, in Cordova, Seville, or Cadiz, And thou shalt be woo'd as a Queen should be, And tended upon as the proud are tended, And the algazuls shall doff to thee, For thy face shall be brighten'd, thy raiment be splendid, And no man shall call thee an evil name, And thou shalt no longer remember thy shame, And thy mother's eyes, as she waxes old, Shall see the thing she would behold— More gold yet, and still more gold!” “Mother, the light is very low— —Out! out! ... Ah God, they are on me now! Mother” (the old woman hears with a groan), “Leave me not here in the darkness alone!” The mother sits by the grave, and listens. She waits: she hears the footsteps go Far under the earth,—bewilder'd—slow. She looks: the light no longer glistens. Still the voice of Rachel from below, “Mother, mother, they have me, and hold! Mother, there is a curse on thy gold! Mercy! mercy! The light is gone— Leave me not here in the darkness alone— Mother, mother, help me and save!” Still Rachel's voice from the grave doth moan. Still Rachel's mother sits by the grave. CATTERINA CORNARO. (A PICTURE.—A.D. 1470.) I. In Cyprus, where 'live Summer never dies, Love's native land is. There the seas, the skies, Are blue and lucid as the looks, the air Fervid and fragrant as the breath and hair, Of Beauty's Queen; whose gracious godship dwells In that dear island of delicious dells, Mid lavish lights and languid glooms divine. There doth she her sly dainty sceptre twine With seabank myrtle spray, and roses sweet And full as, when the lips of lovers meet The first strange time, their sudden kisses be: There doth she lightly reign: there holdeth she Her laughing court in gleam of lemon groves: The wanton mother of unnumber'd Loves! What earthly creature hath Dame Venus' grace Dower'd so divinely sweet of form and face As that she may, unshamed in Cupid's smile, Be sovereign lady of this lovely isle? Sure, Venus, not so blind as some aver Was thy bold boy, what time, in search of her Thou bad'st him seek, he roam'd the seas all round, And barbarous lands beyond; since he hath found This wonder out; whose perfect sweetness seems The fair fulfilment of his own fond dreams: And Kate Cornaro is the Island Queen. II. A Queen: a child: fair: happy: scarce nineteen! In whose white hands her little sceptre lies, Like a new-gather'd flowret, in surprise At being there. To keep her what she is, —A thing too rare for the familiar kiss Of household loves,—wifehood and motherhood,— Fit only to be delicately woo'd With wooings fine and frolicksome as those Wherewith the sweet West woos a small blush-rose, Her husband first, and then her babe, away Slipp'd from her sight, each on a summer day, Ere she could miss them, into the soft shade Of flowery graves. She doth not feel afraid To be alone. Because she hath her toy, Her pretty kingdom. And it is her joy To dandle the doll-people, and be kind And careful to it, as a child. Each wind O' the world on her smooth eyelids lightly breathes, As morn upon a lily whence frail wreaths Of little dew-drops hang, easily troubled, As such things are. The June sun's joy is doubled, Shining thro' shadow in her golden hair. Light-wedded, and light-widow'd, and unaware Of any sort of sorrow doth she seem; Albeit the times are stormy, and do teem With tumult round her tiny throne. Primrose, Pert violet, hardy vetch,—no blossom blows In March less conscious of a cloudy sky, More sweet in sullen season. Days go by Daintily round her. If her crown's light weight Upon her forehead fair and delicate Leave the least violet stain, when laid away At close of some great summer holiday, Her lovers kiss the sweet mark smooth and white Ere it can pain her. She hath great delight In little things: and of great things small care. The people love her; tho' the nobles are Wayward and wild. Yet fears she not, nor shrinks To show she fears not. ‘For in truth,’ she thinks, ‘My Uncle Andrew, and my Uncle Mark, Have care of me.’ And, truly, dawn or dark, These Uncles Mark and Andrew, busiest two In Cyprus, find no lack of work to do: Go up and down the noisy little state Silent all day: and, when the night is late, Write letters, which she does not care to read, (The Ten, she knows, will ponder them with heed) To Venice—not so far from Cyprus' shore, But what the shadow of St. Mark goes o'er The narrow sea to touch her island throne. III. She is herself a dove from Venice flown Not so long since but what her snowy breast Is yet scarce warm within its new-found nest.— Whence sings she o'er the grave of Giacomo Songs taught her by St. Mark. Cristofero, (He of the four stone shields which you may spy, Thrice striped, thrice spotted with the mulberry, In the great sunlight o'er that famous stair Whose marble white is warm'd with rosehues, where The crownings were once) wore the ducal horn In Venice, on that joyous July morn When all along the liquid streets, paved red With rich reflections of clear crimson spread, Or gorgeous orange gay with glowing fringe, From bustling balconies above, to tinge The lucid highways with new lustres, best Befitting that day's pride, the blithe folk press'd About St. Paul's, beneath the palace door Of Mark Cornaro; where the Bucentor Was waiting with the Doge; to see Queen Kate Come smiling in her robes of marriage state Thro' the cramm'd causeway, glimmering down between The sloped bright-banded poles, beneath the green Sea-weeded walls; content to catch quick gleams Of her robe's tissue stiff with strong gold seams From throat to foot, or mantle's sweeping shine Of murrey satin lined with ermine fine. Flushing the white warmth it encircled glad, A sparkling karkanet of gems she had About her fair throat. Such strong splendours piled So heavily upon so slight a child Made Venice proud; because in little things Her greatness thus seem'd greatest. His white wings The galley put forth from the blue lagoon. The mellow disk of a mild daylight moon Was hanging wan in the warm azure air, When the great clarions all began to blare Farewell. And, underneath a cloudless sky Over a calmèd sea, with minstrelsy, The baby Queen to Cyprus sail'd. — JACQUELINE, COUNTESS OF HOLLAND AND HAINAULT. This poem has been already printed in the “Wanderer,” but is more properly placed here. (1436.) Is it the twilight, or my fading sight, Makes all so dim around me? No, the night Is come already. See! thro' yonder pane, Alone in the grey air, that star again— Which shines so wan, I used to call it mine For its pale face; like Countess Jacqueline Who reign'd in Brabant once . . . that's years ago. I call'd so much mine, then: so much seem'd so! And see, my own !—of all those things, my star (Because God hung it there, in heaven, so far Above the reach and want of those hard men) Is all they have not taken from me. Then I call it still My Star. Why not? The dust Hath claim'd the dust: no more. And moth and rust May rot the throne, the kingly purple fray:— What then? Yon star saw kingdoms roll'd away Ere mine was taken from me. It survives. But think, beloved,—in that high life of lives, When our souls see the suns themselves burn low Before that Sun of Righteousness,—and know What is, and was, before the suns were lit— How Love is all in all . . . Look, look at it, My Star—God's star—for being God's 'tis mine: Had it been man's . . . no matter . . . see it shine— The old wan beam, which I have watch'd ere now So many a wretched night, when this poor brow Ached 'neath the sorrows of its thorny crown. Its crown! . . . ah, droop not, dear, those fond eyes down. No gem in all that shatter'd coronet Was half so precious as the tear which wet Just now this pale sick forehead. O my own, My husband, need was, that I should have known Much sorrow,—more than most Queens—all know some,— Ere, dying, I could bless thee for the home Far dearer than the palace,—call thy tear The costliest gem that ever sparkled here. Enfold me, my belovèd. One more kiss. Oh, I must go! 'Twas will'd I should not miss Life's secret, ere I left it. And now see— My lips touch thine—thine arm encircles me— The secret's found—God beckons—I must go Earth's best is given.—Heaven's turn is come to show How much its best earth's best may yet exceed, Lest earth's should seem the very best indeed. So we must part a little; but not long. I seem to see it all. My lands belong To Philip still; but thine will be my grave, (The only strip of land which I could save!) Not much, but wide enough for some few flowers, Thou'lt plant there, by and by, in later hours: Duke Humphry, when they tell him I am dead (And so young too) will sigh, and shake his head, And, if his wife should chide, “Poor Jacqueline,” He'll add, “you know she never could be mine.” And men will say, when some one speaks of me, “Alas, it was a piteous history, The life of that poor Countess!” For the rest Will never know, my love, how I was blest. Some few of my poor Zealanders, perchance, Will keep kind memories of me; and in France Some minstrel sing my story. Pitiless John Will prosper still, no doubt, as he has done, And still praise God with blood upon the Rood. Philip will, doubtless, still be call'd “The Good.” And men will curse and kill: and the old game Will weary out new hands: the love of fame Will sow new sins: thou wilt not be renown'd: And I shall lie quite quiet under ground. My life is a torn book. But at the end A little page, quite fair, is saved, my friend, Where thou didst write thy name. No stain is there, No blot,—from marge to marge, all pure—no tear;— The last page, saved from all, and writ by thee, Which I shall take safe up to Heaven with me. All's not in vain, since this be so. Dost grieve? Belovèd, I beseech thee to believe, Altho' this be the last page of my life, It is my heart's first, only one. Thy wife, Poor tho' she be, O thou sole wealth of mine, Is happier than the Countess Jacqueline! And since my heart owns thine, say—am I not A Queen, my chosen, tho' by all forgot? Tho' all forsake, yet is not this thy hand? I, a lone wanderer in a darken'd land, I, a poor pilgrim with no staff of hope, I, a late traveller down the evening slope, Where any spark, the glow-worm's, by the way, Had been a light to bless . . . have I, O say, Not found, belovèd, in thy tender eyes, A light more sweet than morning's? As there dies Some day of storm all glorious in its even, My life grows loveliest as it fades in Heaven. This earthly house breaks up. This flesh must fade. So many shocks of grief slow breach have made In the poor frame. Wrongs, insults, treacheries, Hopes broken down, and memory which sighs In, like a night wind! Life was never meant To bear so much in such frail tenement. Why should we seek to patch and plaster o'er This shatter'd roof, crusht windows, broken door, The light already shines thro'? Let them break! Yet would I gladly live for thy dear sake, O my heart's first and last, if that could be! In vain! . . . yet grieve not thou. I shall not see England again, and those white cliffs; nor ever Again those four grey towers beside the river, And London's roaring bridges: never more Those windows with the market-stalls before, Where the red-kirtled market-girls went by In the great square, beneath the great grey sky, In Brussels: nor in Holland, night or day, Watch those long lines of siege, and fight at bay Among my broken army, in default Of Gloucester's failing forces from Hainault: Nor shall I pace again those gardens green, With their clipt alleys, where they call'd me Queen, In Brabant once. For all these things are gone. But thee I shall behold, my chosen one, Tho' we should seem whole worlds on worlds apart, Because thou wilt be ever in my heart. Nor shall I leave thee wholly. I shall be An evening thought,—a morning dream to thee,— A silence in thy life when, thro' the night, The bell strikes, or the sun, with sinking light, Smites all the empty windows. As there sprout Daisies, and dimpling tufts of violets, out Among the grass where some corpse lies asleep, So round thy life, where I lie buried deep, A thousand little tender thoughts shall spring, A thousand gentle memories wind, and cling. O, promise me, my own, before my soul Is houseless,—let the great world turn and roll Upon its way, unvext . . . . Its pomps, its powers! The dust saith to the dust, . . . “the earth is ours.” I would not, if I could, be Queen again, For all the walls of the wide world contain. Be thou content with silence. Who would raise A little dust and noise of human praise, If he could see, in yonder distance dim, The silent eye of God that watches him? Oh! couldst thou see all that I see to-night Upon the brinks of the great Infinite! “Come out of her, my people, lest ye be Partakers of her sins!” . . . . My love, but we Our treasure where no thieves break in and steal Have stored, I trust. Earth's weal is not our weal. Let the world mind its business—peace or war; Ours is elsewhere. Look, look,—my star, my star! It grows, it glows, it spreads in light unfurl'd;— Said I “my star?” No star—a world—God's world! What hymns adown the jasper sea are roll'd? Even to these sick pillows! Who enfold White wings about me? Rest, rest, rest . . . . I come! O love, I think that I am near my home. Whence was that music? Was it Heaven's I heard? “Write ‘Blessed are the dead that die i' the Lord, Because they rest,’” . . . because their toil is o'er. The voice of weeping shall be heard no more In the Eternal City. Neither dying Nor sickness, pain nor sorrow, neither crying, For God shall wipe away all tears. Rest, rest . . . . Thy hand, my husband,—so—upon thy breast! THE DIRGE. Pluck the pale sky-colour'd periwinkle, That haunts in dewy courts, and shuns the light: Gather dim violets and the wild eyebright, That green old ruin'd walls doth oversprinkle: And cull, to keep her company In death, rue, sage, and rosemary, And flowery thyme from the faint bed o' the bee; For they, when Summer's o'er, make savour sweet To cherish Winter: strew black-spikèd clove, And mint, and marjoram, to make my love A misty fragrance for her winding-sheet. But pull not up red tulips, nor the rose, For these be flaunting flowers that live i' the world's gay shows. END OF BOOK VII.</field>

NARRATIVE, DRAMATIC, AND LYRICAL. “Semper enim, ubi de spe æternitatis agitur, omnia alia contemnere non solum licet, sed etiam expedit.” Cardan Proxenela., cxii. 666, Elzevir edit. THE DEAD POPE. [Possibly, one of those numerous facezie, common about Rome during the ‘Ages of Faith.’ Thence, after the Reformation, it may have found its way into Germany; being there caught up, and used as a weapon of offence by the zeal of the Reformed Pulpits; which, in the vehement and clumsy handling of it, contrived (as it would seem) to convert the fool's feather into the leaden sword. Thus it reaches us at last distorted and transformed. Hence the serio-comic, half grotesque, and altogether incongruous character of it.] I. The whole day long had been wild and warm, With a heavy forewarning of what was to come. There had been, indeed, no such horrible storm For many a year, men say, in Rome. I remember it burst just after the close Of the day when the dead Pope was laid in the Dome Of St. Peter; taking his last repose, To the grief of all good Christendom. Here, before I am further gone with his story, It is fit I should mention that, when he died, He was of a good old age; grown hoary In wearing the white robe, well descried By sinner, and saint, and catechumen, Judex gentium, mundi lumen! Of a truth, he had sat so long in Rome, Sat so long in Peter's chair, Ruling the world, that he was come To keep his power apart from care. His hairs were few, and white With the hoar of many years: His eyes were filmy, and weak, And humid, and heavy, and wan: And all the look of the man Was as dull, and feeble, and bleak As the watery blunt starlight, And thin snow, of a north March night, When its wearied face appears Bathed cold in a clammy grey, Before the sluggish season clears Earth's winter rubbish away. Yet Winter's wine-cup cheers The dull heart of his discontent, While the joy of his jolly hearth endears His home in the frosty element: And, whatever the fretful folk may say, This Pope was a pleasant Pope, and a gay, For what should trouble his merriment? There's many a text, . . . and this comes pat, ‘Dominus me lætificat,’ And ‘Filii hominum usquequo Gravi corde?’ David, too, Sayeth in the psalm ‘In Deo Exultabo', also ‘meo In corde tu lætitiam Dedisti.’ Saith he, ‘Dormiam In pace.’ Where's the harm of that? So (since it is better to laugh than weep) Leaving the wolf to look after the sheep, Whilst ever the stormy nobles raved, And the wickedness ran over in Rome, And sinners, grown stout, refused to be saved, Save now and then by a martyrdom, He smiled, and, warming his heart with wine, Daily, gaily quaff'd the cup. Albeit there were some who seem'd to opine, By their sullen faces and doggerel verses, That the cup so quaff'd was fill'd with curses, Averring, as their spleen dictated, That, to claim the price of its filling up With the much-wrong'd blood of His bruisèd Vine The dreadful unseen Vintager waited Aware at the gate. But we all of us know The Devil is apt to quote Scripture so: And what harm if still, as those famous keys Of the double world's appointed porter, From the good man's girdle hung at their ease, While the days grew chillier, darker, shorter, The cellar key in the cellar door (More nimble than each of those rusty twins) Daily, gaily, all the more Made music among the vaults and bins? II. For oh, what a paradise was there, Set open by that kindly key! Joyous, gentle, debonair, The soul of every grape that dwells By Tuscan slopes, o'er Umbrian dells, Or else, where, oft, in azure air, Round serene Parthenope Witless wandering everywhere, Drunken sings the sultry bee, Or where, purpling tombs of kings, Castel d' Aso's violet springs: Montepulciano, the master-vine; Chiante, that comforts the Florentine; With many a merry-hearted wine From Dante's own delicious vale, Whose sweetness hangs, in odours frail Of woods and flowers, round many a tale Of tears, along the lordly line Of the scornful Ghibeline, — Dante's vale, and Love's, and mine, The pleasant vale of the Casentine! Nor lack'd there many and many a train Of kingly gifts,—the choicest gain Of terraced cities over the sea: The fiery essence of fierce Spain, The soul of sunburnt Sicily, The Frankish, Rhenish, vintage, all The purple pride of Portugal, —Whole troops of powers celestial, The slayers of sullen Pain! O what spirits strong and subtle! Whether to quicken the pulses' play, And dance the world, like a weaver's shuttle To and fro in the dazzling loom Where Fancy weaves her wardrobe gay; Or soften to faintness, sweet as the fume From silver censers swung alway To music, making a mellow gloom, The too intrusive light of the day. Some that bathe the wearied brain, And untie the knotted hair On the pucker'd brows of Care; Soothe from heavy eyes the stain Of tears too long represt; make fair With their transcendent influence Fate's frown; or feed with nectar-food The lips of Longing, and dispense To the tired soul despair'd-of good: Others that stir in the startled blood Like tingling trumpet notes intense, To waken the martial mood. By the mere faint thought of it, well I wis Such a heaven on earth were hardly amiss; And I hold it no crime to set it in rhyme That I think a man might pass his time In company worse than this. III. But, however we pass Time, he passes still, Passing away whatever the pastime, And, whether we use him well or ill, Some day he gives us the slip for the last time. Even a Pope must finish his fill, And follow his time, be it feast time or fast time. As it happen'd with this same Pope. No doubt What sleep was his after that last bout, When he could not wake! so they laid him out. ‘He is gone,’ they said, ‘where there's no returning. Of the college who is the next to come?’ Then they set the bells tolling, the tapers burning, And bore him up into Peter's dome. IV. And that day the whole world mourn'd with Rome. V. Now, after the organ's drowning note Grew hoarse, then husht, in his golden throat, And the latest loiterer, slacking his walk, Cast one last glance at the catafalk, And, passing the door, renew'd his talk As to that last raid of Prince Colonna, —‘What villages burn'd? and what hope of indemnity?’ The Beauty from Venice (or was it Verona?) With the nimbus of red gold hair, God bless her! And who should be the late Pope's successor? I say—that, as soon as the crowd was gone, And never a face remain'd in sight, As the tapers were brightening in chapels dim, Just about the time of the coming on And settling down of the ghostly light, The sudden silence so startled him That the dead Pope rose up. VI. And, first, he fumbled, and stretch'd his hand, Feeling for the accustom'd cup; For the taste of the wine was yet in his mouth; And, finding it not, and vext with drouth, Feebly, as ever, he call'd out. For a Pope . . . what need has a Pope to shout, Whose feeblest whisper from land to land Is echoed, east, west, and north, and south? But, no one coming to his command, He rubb'd his eyes, and look'd about, And saw, thro' a swimming mist, each face Of his predecessors, gone to Grace Many a century ago, Sternly staring at him so (From their marble seats, a mournful row) As who should say ‘Be cheerful, pray! ‘Make the best of it as you may: We are all of us here in the same sad case: Each in his turn, we must one by one die, Even the best of us— God help the rest of us! Your turn, friend, now. Make no grimace. Consider sic transit gloria mundi!’ He began to grow aware of the place. A settling strangeness more and more Crept over him, never felt before, As he stept down to the marble floor. He look'd up, and down, above him, and under, Fill'd with uncomfortable wonder. What should persuade him that he was dead? A horrible humming in the head? A giddy lightness about the feet? Last night's wine, and this night's heat! Where were the Saints and Apostles, each With the bird or beast that belongs to him, Each on a cushion of cloud,—no film, But solid and smooth like a pale-colour'd peach; In a holy hurry the hand to reach Down to him out of the glory dim Where the multitudinous cherubim, With wingèd heads, and wonderful eyes Wide open, are watching in due surprise How Heaven puts on its holiday trim To welcome a Pope when he dies? He could guess by the incense afloat on the air Some service not yet so long o'er But what he might have slept unaware, Nor yet quite waked. What alone made him fear Was that draperied, lighted, black thing there, Not quite like a couch, and too much like a bier. But anyhow ‘Wherefore linger here?’ And, pushing the heavy curtain by That flapp'd in the portal, the windy floor Sucking its flat hem sullenly, He pass'd out thro' the great church door. VII. So forth, on the vacant terrace there, Overlooking the mighty slope Of never-ending marble stair, 'Twixt the great church and the great square, Stood the dead Pope. On either side glade heap'd on glade Of colossal colonnade, Lost, at last, in vague and vast Recesses of repeated shade By those stupendous columns cast; In midst of which, as they sang and play'd, (Fire and sound!) the fountains made Under the low faint starlight, laid Not far above their splendours bright, Fresh interchange of laughters light, Mixt with the murmur of the might Of royal Rome which, dim in sight, Revelling under the redness wide Of lamps now winking from hollow and height, With a voice of pride on every side Lay ready to receive the night. VIII. Thus, all at once, and all around, The silence changed itself to sound More horrible than mere silence is, —The sound of a life no longer his. Fresh terror seized him where he stood; Or the fear that follow'd him, shifting ground, Fresh onslaught made; and he rested afraid To call or stir, like a sick owl, stray'd From a witches' cave back again to the wood Wherein, meanwhile, the noisy brood Of little birds, with lusty voice, Made free of his presence, begin to rejoice, And he halts in alarm lest, perchance, if he cries out, Those creatures, fit only to furnish him food, Already by liberty render'd loquacious, Picking up heart, and becoming audacious, Should forthwith fall to pecking his eyes out. IX. Indeed, one might fairly surmise From the noise in the streets, the shouts and cries, That all the men and women in Rome, From the People's Gate to St. Peter's Dome, Tho' clad in mourning, each and all, Were making the most of some festival: Walking, driving, talking, striving, Each with the rest, to do his best To add to the tumult; each contriving To make, in pursuit of his special joys, Something more than the usual noise. Since it is not every day in the week That one Pope dies, and another's to seek. Such an event is a thing to treasure: For a general mourning's a general meeting, —A sort of general grief-competing, Which leads, of course, to a general greeting, (Not to mention the general drinking and eating) That is quite a general pleasure. X. The universal animation, In a word, you could hardly underrate. So much to talk of, so much to wonder at! The Ambassadors, first, of every nation, Representing the whole world's tribulation, Each of them grander than the other, In due gradation for admiration; How they lookt, how they spoke, what sort of speeches? What sort of mantles, coats, collars, and breeches? Then, the Cardinals, all in a sumptuous smother Of piety, warm'd by the expectation Which glow'd in the breast of each Eminent Brother Of assuming a yet more eminent station, —Much, he hoped, to each Eminent Brother's vexation. And then, the Archbishops, and Bishops, and Priors, And Abbots, and Orders of various Friars, Treading like men that are treading on briars, Doubtful whom, in the new race now for the State run, They should hasten to claim as their hopeful patron. The Nobles, too, and their Noble Families, Prouder each than the very devil, Yet turn'd, all at once, appallingly civil, And masking their noble animosities For the sake of combining further atrocities: And, after each of the Noble Families, Each Noble Family's faithful Following; Who, picking their way while the crowd kept holloaing, Stuck close to their chiefs, and proudly eyed them, Much the same as each well-provender'd camel eyes, In the drouthy desert, when groaning under Their pleasing weight of public plunder, The dainty despot boys that ride them. A host, too, of Saints, with their special religions, And patrons, of rival rank and station; Which, as they pass'd, the very pigeons On the roofs uproused in a consternation; Being deckt in all manners of ribbons and banners, Painted papers, and burning tapers Enough to set in a conflagration The world, you would think by the fume and flare of them, And the smoky faces of those that had care of them; All marching along with a mighty noise Of barking dogs, and shouts, and cheers, Brass music, and bands of singing boys, Doing their best to split men's ears. XI. The excitement was certainly justifiable. The more so, if, having fairly computed The importance, necessity, and function Of a Pope, as divinely instituted, You consider the fact, which is undeniable, That, when deprived of its special pastor, The whole of earth's flock, without compunction, Must consider itself consign'd to disaster. For, if the world, say, Could go on as it should, Doing its duty, fair and good, Missing no crumb of its Heavenly food, For even a week or a day In the absence of Heaven's Representative, Might it not be assumed from any such tentative Process, if this each time succeeded, That a Pope, on the whole, is hardly needed? And that, if it should ever befal That Heaven might be pleased, after due delay, Its Viceroy on earth to recall, And abolish that post, just as good and as gay The world would go on in the usual way Without a Pope at all? XII. To this Pope however, yet upon earth, Who, tho' dead, knew what a live Pope is worth, That sight was somewhat provoking: Millions of men, all jostling, joking, As merry as so many Prodigal Sons, Having kill'd and roasted their fatted calf, And enjoying the chance to quaff and laugh; And yet not one of those millions Who seem'd aware of the dead Pope there, Or even very much to care What had become of His Holiness, How he must feel now, or how he might fare; Who, all the while, was nevertheless Sole cause of the general joyousness. This was certainly hard to bear. His hand he raised: no man lookt to it. His finger: not a knee was crookt to it. He raised his voice: no man heeded it. He gave his blessing: no man needed it. 'Twas the merest waste of benevolence, Since the holiday went on with or without him. He might have been to all intents The golden Saint stuck up on the steeple, Who is always blessing a thankless people, Nobody caring a button about him. Bless, or curse, neither better nor worse For a single word that he said, On its wonted way a world perverse Went onward, nobody bowing the head Either for hope, or yet for dread. XIII. Then the dead Pope knew that he was dead. XIV. He walk'd onward—no man stopping him, Ever onward—no lip dropping him A salve: nobody making way For the Pope to pass, as the Pope pass'd on Thro' that rude irreverent holiday: Till the streets behind him, one by one, Fell off, and left him standing alone In the mighty waste of Rome's decay. Meanwhile, the night was coming on Over the wide Campagna: Hot, fierce, a blackness without form, And in her breast she bore the storm. I never shall forget that night! You might tell by the stifling stillness there, And the horrible wild-beast scent on the air, That all things were not right. XV. On Mount Cavi the dark was nurst, And the Black Monks' belfry towers above: Then, vast, the sea of vapour burst Where forlorn Ferretian Jove Hears only the howlet's note accurst Mid his fallen fanes no more divine: And from the sea to the Apennine: And swift across the rocky line Where the blighted moon dropp'd first Behind Soracte, black and broad Up the old Triumphal Road, From Palestrino post on Rome, Nearer, nearer, you felt It come, The presence of the darksome Thing! As when, dare I say, with outstretcht wing, By some lean Prophet summon'd fast To punish the guilt of a stiff-neckt king, Over the desert, black in the blast, On Babylon, or Egypt red, The Angel of Destruction sped. Earth breathed not, feigning to be dead: While the whole of Heaven overhead Was overtaken unaware, First here, then there, then everywhere. Into the belly of blackness suckt, Sank the dwindling droves of buffaloes That spotted the extreme crimson glare: Then the mighty darkness stronger rose, Swallowing leagues of lurid air, And cross'd the broken viaduct, Flung forth in dim disorder there Like the huge spine-bone of the skeleton Of some dead Python, left to obstruct The formless Night-hag's filmy path: Thence on, by the glimmering creeks and nooks Where the waterflats look sick and white, Putting out quite the pallid light Of the yellow flowers by the sulphur brooks, That make a sullen brimstone bath For the Nightmare's noiseless hoof: And, leaving the quench'd-out east aloof, The plague, from Tophet vomited, Struck at the west, and rushing came Right against the last red flame, Where in cinders, now, the day, Self-condemn'd to darkness, lay With all his sins upon his head Burning on a fiery bed, Helpless, hopeless, overthrown. XVI. Now, to all the world it is well known How the Devil rides the wind by night: Doing all the harm he can In the absence of Heaven's light To the world's well-order'd plan, And with murrain, mildew, blight, Or thunder blue, or hailstone white, Marring the thrift of the honest man, Which much doth move his spite. XVII. Certainly, he was out that night, What time the fearful storm began. For lo! on a sudden, left and right, The heaven was gash'd from sky to sky, Seam'd across, and sunder'd quite, By a swift, snaky, fork-tongued flash Of brightness intolerably bright; As, ever, the angry Cherub, vow'd To vengeance, fast thro' plunging cloud Wielding wide his withering lash, That wild horseman now pursued: Who lurk'd, his vengeance to elude, In deep unprobèd darkness still. Forthwith, the wounded night 'gan spill Great drops: then fierce—crash crusht on crash— As it grieved beneath each burning gash, The darkness bellow'd; and outsprang Wild on the plain, whilst yet it rang With thunder, the infernal steed, And dash'd onward at full speed, Blind with pain, with streaming mane, And snorting nostril on the strain, Where, dasht from off his flanks, the rain Thro' all the desolate abyss Of darkness, now began to hiss. XVIII. And here (for this story is scatter'd about The world in dozens of different shapes) One writes . . . . Some Lutheran lean, I doubt, Who, nameless, thus from shame escapes. —Lies thrive and flourish by the score: Take this for what 'tis worth, no more:— “Out leaping from that riven rack Of cloud, where night was boiling black, And so escaping, as God will'd, While, for a time, the storm was still'd, Satan beheld the face he knew, Amoris actus impetu. And to the Shepherd gone astray Grimly the black goats' Goatherd said ‘Service for service! on their way To me full many hast thou sped: And, since it is a stormy night, Lest thou shouldst lose thine own way quite, (For how shouldst thou the right way know Who seek'st it out the first time now?) Content am I thy guide to be. Nor marvel that 'tis known to me, The way to Heaven. For who but I Makes half the ways there, that men try? Moreover, there's no jolly sin Which those I lead may not take in, If they themselves can pass the gate Whereat, of course, we separate. For all the members of my flock Come furnisht with Indulgences In proper form—a goodly stock! 'Tis but to pick and chuse from these. Paid for they are; and, signo hoc, Well paid, if Peter will but please That wicket to unlock.’” XIX. A spiteful fable. Best to own The truth can ne'er by us be known. But alas! for any poor ghost of a Pope In such a night to be doom'd to grope, Blind beneath the hideous cope Of those black skies without a star, For the way to where the Blessèd are! And, if the Evil One, himself, Was his conductor thro' the dark; Or, if, dislodged from its sky-shelf Some cloud was made his midnight bark; Or if the branding bolt, that rent The skies asunder, hew'd for him Thro' that disfeatured firmament, Beyond the utmost echoing brim Of thunder-brewage, and the black Unblissful night, some shining track Up to the Sapphire Throne, where throng The Voices crying ‘Lord, how long?’ While the great years are onward roll'd With moans and mutterings manifold; I know not, for it was not told. XX. It would seem, however, all texts agree (And this should suffice us at anyrate) In assuming for certain that, early or late, The dead Pope got to the Golden Gate Where the mitred Apostle sits with the key, —Peter, whose heir upon earth was he. And further than this to speculate I, for one, do not feel justified. Tho' a fact there is, I am bound to state: A renegade Monk avers he descried In a vision that very night, When the storm was spending its fiercest hate (—And what he saw, so much the sight Impress'd him, he wrote as soon as he woke: —Was it a dream, or a wicked joke?) What pass'd before That Gate. XXI. Now, since, after the fashion then in vogue, He wrote it in form of a dialogue, Not averring, as he did, the dream to be true, In all else, as he wrote it, I write it for you: VOICE OUTSIDE THE GATE. “Peter, Peter, open the Gate! VOICE WITHIN. I know thee not. Thou knockest late. FIRST VOICE. Late! yet, Peter, look, and see Who calleth. SECOND VOICE. Nay, I know not thee. What art thou? FIRST VOICE. Peter, Peter, ope The Gate! SECOND VOICE. What art thou? FIRST VOICE. The dead Pope. SECOND VOICE. The Pope? what is it? FIRST VOICE. In men's eye Thy successor, late, was I. What was thine was given to me. SECOND VOICE. Martyrdom and misery? FIRST VOICE. Nay, but power to bind and loose. In thy name have I burn'd Jews And heretics, and all the brood Of unbelief . . . VOICES FAR WITHIN. Avenge our blood, Lord! FIRST VOICE. And in thy name have blest Kings and Emperors; confest Earth's Spiritual Head, while there I sat ruling in thy chair. VOICES FAR WITHIN. Woe! because the kings of earth Were with her in her wicked mirth! FIRST VOICE. In thy name, and for thy cause, I made peace and war, set laws To lawgivers . . . VOICES FAR WITHIN. And all nations Drunk with the abominations Of her witchcraft! FIRST VOICE. In thy name, And for thy cause, to sword and flame I gave sinners; and to those That fear'd the friends, and fought the foes, Of him from all mankind selected To keep thy name and cause respected, Riches and rewards I gave, And the joy beyond the grave. VOICES FAR WITHIN. Souls of men, too, chaffering lies, Did she make her merchandise. FIRST VOICE. By all means have I upheld Thy patrimony—nay, 'tis swell'd. VOICES FAR WITHIN. For herself she glcrified In the riches of her pride. FIRST VOICE. Wherefore, Peter, ope the Gate! If my knocking now be late, Little time, in truth, had I —I, the Pope, who stand and cry! For other cares than those that came Upon me, in thy cause and name, Holding up the heavy keys Of Heaven, and Hell. SECOND VOICE. If so, if these Thou hast in keeping, wherefore me Callest thou? Thou hast the key. Truly thou hast waited late! Open, then, thyself, The Gate.” And here the Monk breaks off, to state, With befitting reflections by the way, With what great joy the Pope, no doubt, Soon as he heard the stern voice say Those words, began to search about Among his garments, for the key; Which, strange to say, 'twould seem that he Had not bethought him of before. And how that joy, from more to more, Wax'd most (the historian of his dream Observes, as he resumes the theme) “When, after search grown desperate, A key he found,—just as his need Seem'd at the worst,—a key, indeed! But, ah vain hope! for, however the Pope Tried the key in the fasten'd Gate, Turning it ever with might and main This way, that way, every way at last, Forwards—backwards—round again— Till his joy is turn'd to sheer dismay at last, And his failing force will no longer cope With the stubborn Gate,—it declines to ope. A key, indeed! but not, alas, The Key.” Who shall say what key it was? The Monk, who here, I must believe, Is laughing at us in his sleeve, (Like any vulgar story-teller, Fabling forms to vent his spleen) Surmises that it must have been The key of the Pope's own cellar. THOMAS MÜNTZER TO MARTIN LUTHER. (FROM PRISON.) I know not if what now my spirit doth spend This tortur'd frame's last strength in sore endeavour To write to thee will reach thee, Luther, ever. For I, whose crime is to have been man's friend, No friend can claim, whose friendship's faith I may Trust these, my life's last words, to thee to send, After my death, which thou dost urge, men say. I know not, Luther, if what's writ to-night Be for thy reading, or for any man's. 'Tis as God wills. But, since His own eye scans, And answers, in my heart, what now I write, Still I write on, while He withholds the end. And, setting bare my spirit in God's sight, I summon thine to witness. 'Twere in vain To urge the old sad difference o'er again. Doom'd to an imminent death,—a dreadful one In all save this,—that death, whate'er the shape God gives it, is the event of life alone Graced with God's last great gift to man,—escape From men's tormenting,—I desire not now To argue a long-talk'd theology. How much mere knowledge with mere life may grow Concerns not one that, being about to die, Approaches Truth by no such process slow. Too near death's hour of certainty am I. But O the pity! Had we two been one! As once we might have been: who cannot be, Henceforth, united, till by God's clear throne We stand together, with Heaven's eyes to see What Earth's miss'd sadly: each, Man's champion, And, therefore, God's! We, in this dark, abused By the false glare of midnight watchfires, seen Across a warring world, where all's confused, Mistook for foes each other, who, I ween, Are soldiers of the self-same King. And so We fought, and, struck by thee, I fall. Each blow Of thine, which I must pardon and deplore, A friend's mistake! tho' fatal, Luther, more Than if a foe had dealt it. O why, why This woeful haste, that mars so much? See here The sad result. For, Luther, while I die, What ominous, incongruous faces leer Beside thine own with laughing lip and eye? What strange unholy helpmates share with thee The sad bad joy of this false victory O'er me and man? Error on error! see, Beneath the same soil'd banner at thy side, Hand clasping hand, grim Saxon George allied With him of Hesse! sworn foes erewhile, tho' now George, who would think he did God service good Could he but rend thee limb from limb, as thou Bids't him rend me, red with thy brother's blood, Thy right hand holds: who clasps the other? he, The Landgrave, who hates him, as both hate me. And thou, the while, art hugging each red hand! What glues so fast the fratricidal Three Together thus? And what of such a band The shameful central link makes Luther be? My blood. O shame, shame, shame, my brother, shame! Is it not sad that God such things should see, And thou the cause? O worst disgrace of all! That, when God asks ‘Who did this?’ men must name Their noblest, and the blame of such deeds fall On him whose scorn should brand them with the blame Such deeds deserve. Error beyond recall! Yet, think, think, Luther, and be sad 'tis so. Desirest thou man's good? I wot thou dost. But self hath film'd thy spirit's eagle eye. Hear him not, heed him not, since cry he must, The flattering fiend, that in thy heart doth cry! I hear the plausible serpent tempting Dust To mimic God! and thou dost taste his lie, And in the sweetness of it take delight, Murmuring ‘Man's good! for what else have I striven, Toil'd, dared, done battle, conquer'd? Man's good, ay! But man's good, by my gift, to mankind given, Not man's good, man's hereditary right.’ Hath it not oft thus whisper'd thee? and thou Hast listen'd till it seem'd God's voice! By night, When thoughts speak loud that scarce dare whisper low By daylight,—when the Tempter saith his say, And will be answer'd,—doubtless to me, too, Would some such wandering whisper steal its way At times, from the abyss. I thank God, who Gave my soul strength to answer stoutly Nay, And foil Pride's prelate-devil of his prey! Consider, Luther . . . 'tis Paul speaks, not I . . . How all are members of the Body of Christ: Where were the hearing, were the body all eye? Were it all ear, in what would sight exist? Were all one member, where the body then? Many the members, tho' the body is one: One Spirit of God in many lives of men: Can the eye say to the hand ‘Need have I none Of thee’? or can the head say to the feet ‘I need ye not’? Nay, rather they which be The body's feeblest members most complete The body's being: rather those that we Esteem least comely claim the comeliest care, Those least in honour honour most entreat: Since to the body these most needful are: The weaker parts chief cherishing demand: The limbs crave clothing—not the head, the hand. What gleam'd on Corinth, in the dawn of Faith, Is Luther blind to, in Faith's noonday blaze? To thee, Apostle, still the Poor Man saith The selfsame word that in the old proud days Paul to the rich Corinthians cried. They heard, Believed, obey'd, and blest the Preacher's word. To Corinth God one preacher sent: to thee A thousand preachers cry aloud, my brother. The fetter'd foot rebukes the hand that's free. Should not we members cherish one another? For if one member suffereth pain or wrong All suffer with it, and the whole frame ails: Since each to each the bodily parts belong, And none without his fellow's help avails The body's use. But is it so with us? The Rich oppress the Poor: the Strong the Weak: The hand lops off the foot. The body, thus Self-mutilated, suffers, and doth shriek: But the ear hears not what the tongue doth cry, And the hand helps not, and Shame shuts the eye! I sought to heal this sickness into health: To mitigate, not magnify, man's wrong: For Want win justice, and give worth to Wealth: To free the Weak, not to enslave the Strong: Mid gifts unequal, mid unequal powers, Secure the equal happiness of all: Maintain God's law in this mad world of ours: Replace the force of mere material thrall By force of love; the old empiry of Might, Which is imposed upon unwilling hate, By the serene sweet sovereignties of Right, That are accepted, and secured i' the state Of man's free spirit, by the loyal love Of what the soul perceives to be Above. I sought to attain this by no violent aids: I preach'd not Justice from the cannon's mouth In humble hearts, not over crownèd heads, I claim'd dominion, and 'twas granted. Youth, Hope's dawn-star trembling in his tear-lit eyes; Old Age, the twilight of his toilful day Suffused with solemn joy—like evening skies That promise watchful shepherds a fair morn— Brightening his grave, calm, satisfied regard; And Womanhood—the maiden in her May, The care-worn wife, with hungry eyes, grown hard From grieving without hope—pale mothers, worn With nursing breadless babes; the wan array Of this world's weary hearts;—all these, no scorn Could sneer to shame, no cares could keep away, No want withhold, from Love's new-found domain. Love shew'd his face, and was forthwith beloved! No drop of blood was shed, no victim slain, For love of all in each loved spirit moved, And this man's pleasure was not that man's pain; But in Mulhausen God saw, and approved, The bloodless triumph that bequeath'd no stain To Love's least soldier. And there rose on earth. For Heavenly augury of human gain, A glorious Form of innocent beauty and mirth, —A little State like One large Family: All members of one body at one birth: And all were lowly, because all were high: None poor: none idle: tyrant none, nor thrall: Strong labour for the strong: light for the weak: Labour for all: and food for all: for all Hope that makes strong, and Reverence that makes meek, Conscience that governs, Justice that allies, Love that obeys, and Faith that fortifies. And so, it grew, and grew: and so, I deem'd It might grow yet—Earth's fruit of Heavenly seed! But no! the vulture swoop'd, the eagle scream'd, The roused hawk hunger'd, and the dove must bleed! The banded anarchs of a brutal time Hated us strongly, and were strong: their greed Was made earth's god: their lust earth's law sublime: We loved, and we were weak: that was our crime. And where was Luther then? From town to town Chasing grey-headed Carlstadt, his old friend: Denouncing, persecuting, hunting down, Down, to a noble life's disastrous end, The man, to whom, in God's attesting name, His solemn faith was pledged not long before: The man he loathed because he could not tame That old man's fearless spirit any more To crouch to his! Or to obedience old Scolding Melanchthon's meeker nature back. . . . . Ah, dear Melanchthon, loved, tho' lost! How, fold On fold, the blurr'd Past lifts its vapour black, To let emerge those melancholy eyes Once more, which still my wrong'd heart loves! Alack, Love is not always just, nor Memory wise. May truer friends forgive me, that I cease, A moment even, to list to their loud woes! The thought of thee o'er all things breathes sad peace: And, for a while, in sorrowful repose The world's vast wail is husht, to let me hear The old sweet fluteplaying . . . . so faint, so clear! Melanchthon, never play that flute again! Back, heart, to Luther! Where was Luther then? Maligning Müntzer to the magistrate: The rich man's friend, the friendless people's foe: With frenzied rail, rebuking hope: elate To lift the high-born, lay the low-born low: Now this Elector, now that Landgrave, praising: Thro' all Thuringia preaching scorn and strife: In every Saxon burg crusaders raising Against the accursèd Anabaptist's life! Even then, the untaught patient peasant clung To hope in justice from an unjust power. Sharp was the cry which misery from him wrung, But scant his asking even in that last hour. He ask'd for leave to labour and to live, —A free man's life and labour, not a beast's: To honest Want what honest Wealth may give, Wages for work: Christ's charity from Priests: Justice from Law: and man's humanity From Human Power. His prayer was humbly urged: Scorn was the guerdon, outrage the reply. With hoot and howl, the importunate wretch was scourged From field to forest, and from moor to fen. Then, then at last, lash'd, famisht, to its lair, The frenzied People, raving, rent its den: Then savageries of nature seethed and surged In manly breasts unmann'd by mad despair: Brute hardship brutalised the hearts of men: And beasts of burden changed to wild beasts then. Ay! then, indeed, another voice was heard: Not mine: and stormy listeners, lured by hate, Welcom'd the preacher of a wilder word, With hearts whose love's last cry was strangled late. Like rainless lightning thro' a wildwood ran Stork's fiery utterance: where it dropp'd, it burn'd: And all was flame. For each wrong'd heart of man Caught fire and flared; and, flaring, backward turn'd Before the rushing wind of ruinous Wrath, And pour'd that glare upon a blighted Past: And each beheld, what barr'd the backward path, Some mighty image of a monstrous wrong Whereon the red revengeful light was cast. This saw his son's back bleed beneath the thong: That other his dishonour'd bride beheld, Or ravisht daughter: one, the hunter's throng Trampling his thrifty field: another yell'd ‘In Leipheim bleach my boys' unburied bones!’ One saw his brother burning at the pyre: One caught from bloody racks a comrade's groans: One saw his father on the cross expire. Then burst the dreadful shout, the dooming word, And in the hand of Vengeance flash'd the sword. And peace was pass'd away. To me, to all, No choice survived, but action, and a cause To fight for: man's oppressor, or his thrall: The makers, or the breakers, of bad laws. My choice was fixt, my part imposed: in me No pause disloyal to the past allow'd. Albeit strife's end I could not fail to see: The certain slaughter of an unskill'd crowd, Disaster, disappointment, death: fit ends To false beginnings—war to vengeance vow'd, And valour shamed by violent deeds. My friends To fancied victory, fool'd, with blindfold eyes, Went forth: unblinded I, to sacrifice. Yet, when the Armies of the Poor display'd The Wheel of Fortune on their ensigns borne, Which, in the turning of her hoodwink'd head, Turns all things upside down with captious scorn, ‘Not Chance, but Hope, be our device!’ I said, ‘For godless Fortune's gifts leave Faith forlorn, But God's gift Hope stays fast when these be fled.’ And on the People's flag I blazon'd then Heaven's rainy bow, first rear'd o'er rescued men. Ay! tho' that banner hath been beaten down, That symbol trampled out in streams of blood, While this contented world without a frown Is praising faithless peace in festal mood, Tho' all the friends for whom I hoped are slain Like shambled sheep, and tho' myself must die In some few hours, that hope I still retain: Not with the same wild moment's flashing joy That seized my soul when, in war's desperate hour, I stood on the hill top, and saw beneath The all-surrounding hosts of hostile Power, And mine own helpless sheep, ordain'd to death, A faint and weary flock, which to devour, The herded wolves, hoarse barking, bared sharp teeth; While high in heaven, athwart the thunder-shower, Even as I lifted up my voice, and cried To God, with stretch'd expostulating hand, Sprang forth the sudden rainbow, basing wide O'er battle strewn about the lower land, Storm strewn in heaven, all its aery pride, Triumphant on the everlasting hills! Not thus I hope. No gleam of promise thus Visits this hour, which Heaven with darkness fills. For men must wait. God deigns not to discuss With our impatient and o'erweening wills His times, and ways of working out thro' us Heaven's slow but sure redress of human ills. When Christ was in the garden captived, they That, till that hour, had talk'd and walk'd beside Him, Hoping in Him, lost hope, and fled away, And he that knew Him best ere dawn denied Him. What wonder? All seem'd lost, i' the very eve Of an immortal victory. In man's sight, All was lost. What disciple could believe Love's triumph in Life's failure, that sad night? But God makes light what men make dark: His fire He frees where fall our ashes. And, because I feel God's power, still doth my spirit aspire: Not fearing, even now, that unjust laws By unjust force maintain'd, rack, stake, or cord, The sign'd conventions of convenient Wrong, The tyrant's sceptre, or the hireling's sword, The servile pulpit, timorous to the strong, To the weak truculent, or custom tough, Can crush man's rights forever, or prolong Man's pain an hour, whene'er God cries ‘Enough!’ And for this reason, and because I think I never cared about myself since first I cared for man,—from whom I dare not shrink, Not even tho' he forsake himself,—nor aught Hath Fancy nourisht, or Ambition nurst, That was not featured in the womb of thought By Hope's keen contemplation of man's face; Because I cared not ever, care not now, Which runner's foot be fleetest in the race, Who, at the goal, assumes to grace his brow The garland won, who takes the upper place, Chief at the board, when festal wine-cups flow, So long as, at the last, the goal be gain'd, The garland got, the general table spread; —Whoe'er the man by whom man's aim attain'd, Joy crowns my heart, if victory crown his head! Luther, because 'twas thus—'tis thus—with me, And because, gazing with intensest gaze Round each lost field where my life's ruins be, A gleam of hope for man, in these dark days, —(His last, perchance, for centuries long!—) I see, Or seem to see, i' the spirit-power which stays, Tho' stain'd—like sunrise o'er a stormy sea Pour'd from a clouded crag with struggling rays— On thy firm forehead's pride,—I write to thee. Love mankind, Luther, if thou lovest not me! For thou, great Spirit, art full-arm'd! a soul Clothed with strong thunder by the hand of God: Ardent to combat, potent to control: Gabriel's spear, John's Angel's measuring-rod, The Cherub's flaming sword, and Michael's shield, Were given to thee—to conquer, not to yield. Yield not the Devil his recaptured prey! Conquer for all mankind! Complete thy task! The People, thou wast sent to save and sway, Die in the Desert: thristy lips, that ask In vain for water! perishing feet that stray Farther and farther from the Promist Land, And sink 'neath weary loads along the way! Mock not man's thirst with driblets pour'd i' the sand From the scant leavings of Wealth's well-drain'd flask. Cleave thou the stubborn stone with stern command. Smite these rich rocks! The rod is in thy hand. Thou canst. But if thou wilt not . . . Hark! give ear To this sad prophecy of woes to be, A dying voice to night-winds, moaning here, Delivers, charging them to bear to thee The burthen of Time's melancholy song: The Church thou buildest, scorning first to free Life's cumber'd field for Love's foundations, long Shall be, herself, the slave of Power: and she, Wed to the World, not Christ, the unchristian wrong Of worldly Force with worldly Fraud shall share, And so wax weak by scheming to be strong; Till there shall be on earth a sight to scare Earth's holiest hope from human hearts away: A Priesthood, purchased for complacent prayer, Leagued with Earth's Pomps, for profit and for pay, Against Heaven's Love: praisers of things that are, Scorners of good that's not: cleaving to clay, Strangling the spirit; purblind, unaware! Contracting, not enlarging, day by day, The charities of Christ, with surly care: Till man's indignant heart shall turn away, And chuse the champions of its faith elsewhere. And champions shall it find. Dread champions, they! The impatient offspring of prolong'd despair: A prayerless, pitiless, imperious brood, Whose battle cry shall be a cry for blood. It may come soon, come late, come once for all. Achieve its task, and pass, content, away, That Hour of Fate, which God to life shall call: It may come many times, and miss its prey, And pass, dissatisfied, to come again, More grimly arm'd with greed of greater sway, To rescue from more wretchedness more men: I cannot tell. For unseen hands delay The coming of what oft seems close in ken, And, contrary, the moment, when we say ‘'Twill never come!’ comes on us even then. I cannot tell the coming of that day, If near or far, or how 'twill be, or when: But come it will, and do its work it must, So sure as moves God's spirit in man's dust. Men call me Prophet. And thou, too, in scorn. Prophet I am. For grief hath made me wise. The night's lone watchman feels far off the dawn, And, till redress'd, all wrongs are prophecies. This is no tortured fool's despairing curse, No maniac menace from a murder'd man. Luther, consider—ere man's need be worse, If thou wilt help it, as none other can. I claim not justice now, I do beseech Compassion, for the Poor. To thee, to all, I would, indeed, my dying cry might reach: —Place for the People's Cause! in which I fall. My sands run out. What else my soul would say Must be said shortly. And these fingers write But ill the struggling thoughts that force their way Thro' tortured nerves, and speak in pain's despite. Judge if 'tis pity for myself I crave. Luther, one woman lives that loves me: one Whose life I'd die ten thousand deaths to save: I have no friends, and therefore she hath none, Save God: I cannot shield her, from the grave To which men doom me: worse than all alone I leave her, compass'd with a world of foes! That is the wife whose steps with mine have gone Faithful thro' life, tho' led from woes to woes. I have not breathed one prayer, not made one moan To thee for her, that's as myself, Heaven knows! Much less for this least self, that's soon to die; Tho' it hath suffer'd somewhat. Thrice they bound This body to their rack. Thou wast not by. Thy friends were. Each dictated some fresh wound, And all applauded. Let that pass. For man, Not for myself, I end, as I began, This letter, and this life. With failing force, But not with fainting faith, I lift the cry That speeds my spirit on its sunward course Beyond Death's night. And, as I lived, I die, Man's friend; imploring—tho' it be in vain— From thee, from all—man's pity for man's pain! ADOLPHUS, DUKE OF GUELDERS. (FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES.) Adolphus, Duke of Guelders, having died, Was laid in pomp for men to see. Priests vied With soldiers, which the most should honour him. Borne on broad shoulders through the streets, with hymn And martial music, the dead Duke in state Reach'd Tournay. There they laid him in the great Cathedral, where perpetual twilight dwells, Misty with scents from silver thuribles; Since it seems fitting that, where dead kings sleep, The sacred air, by pious aids, should keep A certain indistinctness faint and fine, To awe the vulgar mind, and with divine Solemnities of silence, and soft glooms, Inspire due reverence around royal tombs. So, in the great Cathedral, grand, he lay. The Duke had gain'd his Dukedom in this way: Once, on a winter night, . . . these things were written Four centuries ago, when men, frost-bitten, Blew on their nails, and curst, to warm their blood, The times, the taxes, and what else they could, . . . A hungry, bleak night sky, with frosty fires Hung hard, and clipt with cold the chilly spires, Bent, for some hateful purpose of its own, To keep sharp watch upon the little town, Which huddled in its shadow, as if there 'Twas safest, trying to look unaware; Earth gave it no assistance, and small cheer, 'Neath that sharp sky, resolved to interfere For its affliction, but lockt up her hand, Stared fiercely on man's need, and his command Rejected, cold as kindness when it cools, Or charity in some men's souls. The pools And water-courses had become dead streaks Of steely ice. The rushes in the creeks Stood stiff as iron spikes. The sleety breeze, Itself, had died for lack of aught to tease On the gaunt oaks, or pine-trees numb'd and stark. All fires were out, and every casement dark Along the flinty streets. A famisht mouse, Going his rounds in some old dismal house, Disconsolate (for since the last new tax The mice began to gnaw each other's backs), Seem'd the sole creature stirring; save, perchance, With steel glove slowly freezing to his lance, A sullen watchman, half asleep, who stept About the turret where the old Duke slept. The young Duke, whom a waking thought, not new, Had held from sleeping, the last night or two, Consider'd he should sleep the better there, Provided that the old Duke slept elsewhere. Therefore, (about four hundred years ago, This point was settled by the young Duke so,) Adolphus—the last Duke of Egmont's race Who reign'd in Guelders, after whom the place Lapsed into Burgundian line—put on His surcoat, buckled fast his habergeon, Went clinking up that turret stairway, came To the turret chamber, whose dim taper flame The gust that enter'd with him soon smote dead, And found his father, sleeping in his bed As sound as, just four hundred years ago, Good Dukes and Kings were wont to sleep, you know. A meagre moon, malignant as could be, Meanwhile made stealthy light enough to see The way by to the bedside, and put out A hand, too eager long to grope about For what it sought. A moment after that, The old Duke, wide awake and shuddering, sat Stark upright in the moon; his thin grey hair Pluckt out by handfuls; and that stony stare, The seal which terror fixes on surprise, Widening within the white and filmy eyes With which the ghastly father gazed upon Strange meanings in the grim face of the son. The young Duke haled the old Duke by the hair Thus, in his nightgear, down the turret stair; And made him trot, barefooted, on before Himself, who rode a horseback, thro' the frore And aching midnight, over frozen wold, And icy meer. (That winter, you might hold A hundred fairs, and roast a hundred sheep, If you could find them, on the ice, so deep The frost had fixt his floors on driven piles.) From Grave to Buren, five and twenty miles, The young Duke hunted thro' the hollow night The old Duke, like a phantom, flitting white Thro' darkness into darkness, and the den Where great men falling are forgot by men. There in a dungeon, where newts dwell, beneath The tower of Buren Castle, until death Took him, he linger'd very miserably; Some say for months; some, years. Tho' Burgundy Summon'd both son and father to appear Before him, ere the end of that same year, And sought to settle, after mild rebuke, Some sort of compromise between the Duke And the Duke's father. But it fail'd. This way The Duke had gain'd his Dukedom. At Tournay, Afterwards, in the foray on that town, He fell; and, being a man of much renown, And very noble, with befitting state, Was royally interr'd within the great Cathedral. There, with work of costly stones And curious craft, above his ducal bones They builded a fair tomb. And over him A hundred priests chanted the holy hymn. Which being ended, . . . “Our archbishop” (says A chronicler, writing about those days) “Held a most sweet discourse.” . . . . And so, the psalm And silver organ ceasing, in his calm And costly tomb they left him; with his face, Turn'd ever upward to the altar-place, Smiling in marble from the shrine below. These things were done four hundred years ago, Adolphus, Duke of Guelders, in this way First having gain'd his Dukedom, as I say. After which time, the great Duke Charles the Bold Laid hold on Guelders, and kept fast his hold. Times change: and with the times too change the men. A hundred years have roll'd away since then. I mean, since “Our archbishop” sweetly preach'd His sermon on the dead Duke, unimpeach'd Of flattery in the fluent phrase that just Tinkled the tender moral o'er the dust Of greatness, and with flowers of Latin strew'd, To edify a reverent multitude, The musty surface of the faded theme “All flesh is grass: man's days are but a dream.” A bad dream, surely, sometimes: waking yet Too late deferr'd! Such honours to upset, Such wrongs to right, such far truths to attain, Time, tho' he toils along the road amain, Is still behindhand; never quite gets thro' The long arrears of work he finds to do. You call Time swift? it costs him centuries To move the least of human miseries Out of the path he treads. You call Time strong? He does not dare to smite an obvious wrong Aside, until 'tis worn too weak to stand The faint dull pressure of his feeble hand. The crazy wrong, and yet how safe it thrives! The little lie, and yet how long it lives! Meanwhile, I say, a hundred years have roll'd O'er the Duke's memory. Now, again behold! Late gleams of dwindled daylight, glad to go: A sullen autumn evening, scowling low On Tournay: a fierce sunset, dying down In clots of crimson fire, reminds a town Of starving, stormy people, how the glare Sunk into eyes of agonised despair, When placid pastors of the flock of Christ Had finish'd roasting their last Calvinist. A hot and lurid night is steaming up, Like a foul film out of some witch's cup, That swarms with devils spawn'd from her damn'd charms. For the red light of burning burgs and farms Oozes all round, beneath the lock'd black lids Of heaven. Something on the air forbids A creature to feel happy, or at rest. The night is cursed, and carries in her breast A guilty conscience. Strange, too! since of late The Church is busy, putting all things straight, And taking comfortable care to keep The fold snug, and all prowlers from the sheep. To which good end, upon this self-same night, A much dismay'd Town Council has thought right To set a Guard of Terror round about The great Cathedral; fearing lest a rout Of these misguided creatures, prone to sin, As lately proven, should break rudely in There, where Adolphus, Duke of Guelders, and Other dead dukes, by whom this happy land Was once kept quiet in good times gone by, With saints and bishops sleeping quietly, Enjoy at last the slumber of the just; In marble; mixing not their noble dust With common clay of the inferior dead. Therefore you hear, with moody measured tread, This Guard of Terror going its grim watch, Thro' ominous silence. Scarce sufficient match, However, even for a hundred lean Starved wretches, lasht to madness, having seen Somewhat too long, or too unworthily look'd Upon, their vile belongings being cook'd To suit each priestly palate. . . . If to-night Those mad dogs slip the muzzle, 'ware their bite! And so, perchance, the thankless people thought: For, as the night wore off, a much-distraught And murmurous crowd came thronging wild to where, I' the market-place, each stifled thoroughfare Disgorges its pent populace about The great Cathedral. Suddenly, a shout, As tho' Hell's brood had broken loose, rock'd all Heaven's black roof dismal and funereal. As when a spark is dropt into a train Of nitre, swiftly ran from brain to brain A single fiery purpose, and at last Exploded, roaring down the vague and vast Heart of the shaken city. Then a swell Of wrathful faces, irresistible, Sweeps to the great Cathedral doors; disarms The Guard; roars up the hollow nave; and swarms Thro' aisle and chancel, fast as locusts sent Thro' Egypt's chambers thick and pestilent. There, such a sight was seen, as, now and then, When half a world goes mad, makes sober men In after years, who comfortably sit In easy chairs to weigh and ponder it, Revise the various theories of mankind, Puzzling both others and themselves, to find New reasons for unreasonable old wrongs. Yells, howlings, cursings; grim tumultuous throngs; The metamorphoses of mad despair: Men with wolves' faces, women with fierce hair And frenzied eyes, turn'd furies: over all The torchlight tossing in perpetual Pulsation of tremendous glare or gloom. They climb, they cling from altar-piece and tomb; Whilst pickaxe, crowbar, pitchfork, billet, each Chance weapon caught within the reckless reach Of those whose single will a thousand means Subserve to (terrible, wild kings and queens Whose sole dominions are despairs), thro' all The marble monuments majestical Go crashing. Basalt, lapis, syenite, Porphyry, and pediment, in splinters bright, Tumbled with claps of thunder, clattering Roll down the dark. The surly sinners sing A horrible black santis, so to cheer The work in hand. And evermore you hear A shout of awful joy, as down goes some Three-hundred-years-old treasure. Crowded, come To glut the greatening bonfire, chalices Of gold and silver, copes and cibories, Stain'd altar-cloths, spoil'd pictures, ornaments, Statues, and broken organ tubes and vents, The spoils of generations all destroy'd In one wild moment! Possibly grown cloy'd And languid, then a lean iconoclast, Drooping a sullen eyelid, fell at last To reading lazily the letters graven Around the royal tomb, red porphyry-paven, Black-pillar'd, snowy-slabb'd, and sculptured fair, He sat on, listless, with spiked elbows bare. When (suddenly inspired with some new hate To yells, the hollow roofs reverberate As tho' the Judgment-Angel pass'd among Their rafters, and the great beams clang'd and rung Against his griding wing) he shrieks: “Come forth, Adolphus, Duke of Guelders! for thy worth Should not be hidden.” Forthwith, all men shout, “Strike, split, crash, dig, and drag the tyrant out! Let him be judged!” And from the drowsy, dark, Enormous aisles, a hundred echoes bark And bellow—“Judged!” Then those dread lictors all, Marching before the magisterial Curule of tardy Time, with rod and axe, Fall to their work. The cream-white marble cracks, The lucid alabaster flies in flakes, The iron bindings burst, the brickwork quakes Beneath their strokes, and the great stone lid shivers With thunder on the pavement. A torch quivers Over the yawning vault. The vast crowd draws Its breath back hissing. In that sultry pause A man o'erstrides the tomb, and drops beneath; Another; then another. Still its breath The crowd holds, hushful. At the last appears, Unravaged by a hundred wicked years, Borne on broad shoulders from the tomb to which Broad shoulders bore him; coming, in his rich Robes of magnificence (by sweating thumbs Of savage artisans,—as each one comes To stare into his dead face,—smeared and smudged), Adolphus, Duke of Guelders, . . . to be Judged! And then, and there, in that strange judgment-hall, As, gathering round their royal criminal, Troopt the wild jury, the dead Duke was found To be as fresh in face, in flesh as sound, As tho' he had been buried yesterday; So well the embalmer's work from all decay Had kept his royal person. With his great Grim truncheon propt on hip, his robe of state Heap'd in vast folds his large-built limbs around, The Duke lay, looking as in life; and frown'd A frown that seem'd as of a living man. Meanwhile those judges their assize began. And, having, in incredibly brief time, Decided that in nothing save his crime The Duke exceeded mere humanity, Free, for the first time, its own cause to try, So long ignored,—they peeled him, limb by limb, Bare of the mingled pomps that mantled him; Stript, singed him, stabb'd him, stampt upon him, smote His cheek, and spat upon it, slit his throat, Crusht his big brow, and clove his crown, and left Adolphus, Guelders' last own Duke, bereft Of sepulture, and naked, on the floor Of the Cathedral. Where, six days, or more, He rested, rotting. What remain'd, indeed, After the rats had had their daily feed, Of the great Duke, some unknown hand, 'tis said, In the town cesspool, last, deposited. “Et, comme ecrit Philippe de Comines (qui mêsmes a été employé en ce different par le Due Charles de Bourgongne) le dit Adolph alla de nuict en plein hyver prendre son vieux pere hors du lict, et lui fit faire pieds nus cincq lieues de chemin, et le detint six mois prisonier en une profonde et obscure prison — Le Due Charles de Bourgongne tacha par plusieurs fois de reconcilier le pere et le fils, mais en vain — sur quoy le fils repondit qu'il aymoit mieux jêter son pere en un puits, et s'y precipiter apres luy que de consentir à un tel accord, disant que son pere avoit gouverné 44 ans, et que partant il estoit maintenant temps qu'il gouvernait aussi quelque peu.”—D. Emanuel V. Meteren. Traduict de Flamend en Francoys par I. D. L. Haye 1618. “Il alla vers Tournay, où il fut tué par les Francais en une escarmouche, non obstant qu'il ne fit que crier Gueldre! Gueldre! ce qui luy arriva selon le juste jugement de Dieu pour sa grande rebellion.”—Ibid, Fol. 9. THE DUKE'S LABORATORY. (A SCENE FROM FLORENCE IN THE SIXTEEENTH CENTURY. ) A portion of the dialogue between Francesco and Bracciano is taken from Signor Guerrazzi's Racconto of “Isabella Orsini.” The Grand Duke's parting injunction to his brother-in-law is historical. The subject has been incidentally treated, in his “White Devil,” by Webster; to whom one of his contemporary eulogists addresses these lines— “Brachiano's Ill, Murthering his Dutchesse, hath by thy rare skill Made him renown'd.”) Persons represented. Francesco dei Medici. Grand Duke of Florence. Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. The Grand Duke's Brother-in-law. Fra Luke. The Grand Duke's Alchemist. (Night. Interior of the Laboratory at the Pitti.) FRA LUKE. Another moment, and 'tis finisht! Ha, The white precipitate begins to form! We'll set thee there, Death's Angel. Presently Thou shalt be sphered. Good ignorant folks believe The art of kingcraft's writ in histories By sages, conn'd from chronicles, and shaped I' the council chamber. Fools! that wicked craft Lies hidden here. And who would study it Must be content to soil his hands . . . like these! (That stain hath never come away—nor will. And now the story that it tells is old As the new fortunes of this House!) . . . must soil His hands, I say, as these be soil'd, and make That sort of surgeon's needle of his mind Which may go thro' the bloody matter cramm'd Into these murtherous manuals of death; Wherein some monk, among his crucibles, Hath noted down how such and such an one, That plotted, prosper'd, sinn'd, and still slept sound. Displeased a Prince on such and such a day, And presently men miss'd him: such a lady, With eyes so lustrous dark, and lips so red, Wore roses in her bosom at the ball, On such a night, and whisper'd one that smiled Beside her for a moment in the dance, ‘To-morrow I await thee,’ then went home Happy, and slept, and never waked: or how On such a day the Conte de Virtù Poison'd his uncle in a dish of beans, With something in the salt,—which some surmise, Erroneously, white hellebore, but he That writes hath proved it arsenic. This, at least, Is policy in the school of Cosimo! And, night by night, I, sitting here, hatch death For this detested race, whose badge I wear, —The better to destroy them! who, for this, Deem me their servant . . . me, pale, patient slave Of one sublime Idea, that, sitting throned At God's right hand, looks down and laughs at kings, While the slow hours lead on her destined day, The Nemesis of History! me, whose back Is bent to this, by culling bitter herbs To swell this scum, till it boil o'er, and purge The rising cauldron of the wrath of God! O thou, my martyr'd brother, sainted soul, Dear murder'd ghost, that, unavenged, criest out To shame Heaven's silence,—Fra Girolamo! We two were servants to the same Idea: Thou, in the sun: I, in the shadow: thou The judge, and I the executioner. Which chose the surer service? Didst thou deem Of such vile stuff as these degenerate times Show all men made of, to rebuild anew This broken Italy, and transmute to gold, For Freedom's crown, mixt metal so made up Of meanest elements? O, too dearly paid, Error too noble! This flaw'd crucible, And these dead minerals which, year by year, I to ennoble have so idly toil'd, Might teach us both the folly of that dream. But thou art gone. And still the rabble crowd, That freed Barabbas and rejected Christ, Caps to the common tyrant. I work on, Patient as Death. Because my trust is rather In man's crimes than his virtues. Rather here, With Messer Nicolo Machiavelli, brother, (Whose book's the bible of that bitter faith Thy life rejected, but thy death confirms) Than in the force of any single life To leaven this dead lump, and quicken it With such a heat as in thine ashes left The latest human hope of Florence cold, Lost Savonarola! Let the shames o' the time Increase and multiply! the swifter speeds The hour of renovation, summonsing To the stern sessions of the assembled Fates Earth's full-grown wickednesses. Sons of Cain, Prosper,—and perish! whiles I nurse your race For condemnation. I, whose eyes have seen The father buried, and whose hands have hope To sepulchre the sons! Who takes the sword Shall perish by it. Be it mine to sow The cropping seed, whilst thou, dread harvester Of lusty sins, laborious Liberty, Whose foison is the full-ear'd field of Time, Sett'st to the sickle sharp thy scorn'd right hand, Which shall anon with unrelenting swathe Reap in the ruddy upsprout. Hist! Who knocks? FRANCESCO. (without). Francesco. FRA LUKE. Enter, Highness! FRANCESCO. (entering.) Salvum tibi! Is the stuff ready? FRA LUKE. Yes. But it must cool. FRANCESCO. Oh, we can wait. How many drops? FRA LUKE. One, Highness. FRANCESCO. Is that enough? Well, life's a vapour, Friar. Man's flesh is but the flower of the field, And in the midst of life we are in death. Last night the Cavaliere Antenori Expired, at Twelve. He did confess his sins, And died, I trust, repentant. Heaven have mercy Upon his soul! FRA LUKE. Amen. What died he of? FRANCESCO. An apoplexy. FRA LUKE. Ah, . . . I comprehend! The cause,—a cord about the jugular. FRANCESCO. Peace, Monk! A man dies by the hand of God. The scandal grew . . . Why even King Philip writes, —But let that pass. De mortuis, Fra Luke, Nil nisi bonum. But for Eleanora . . . FRA LUKE. Is this for her? FRANCESCO. What? what? you question me? Beware! But I have spoken with Don Pietro. The honour of our brother's wife, Fra Luke! By Bacchus! and the thing is infamous. Let him look to it! FRA LUKE. Ay. FRANCESCO. But he's so light! Heady and light. 'Tis idle talking to him. And eaten up with debts. And vices. Zounds, 'Tis the most infamous knight in Christendom! Without a spark of honour—piety— The most ungodly Good-for-naught . . . 'Faith, Friar, We are not fortunate in our family, Nothing but scandals! I am all day long White-washing their iniquities; and still Our House stinks in men's nostrils—and they know it— Worse than a plague-pit! FRA LUKE. But your Highness soon Will make it quite a whited sepulchre. O my good lord, how well this noble zeal For the fair fame of your illustrious House Becomes your august father's glorious son! Could you but know how fervent is my faith In that vast work, for whose accomplishment My soul divines in your great daily deeds The unanswerable warrant of high God! But shrink not! shrink not! you have far to go, And much to do,—in furtherance of God's will. Shrink not, great Master of the Medici! FRANCESCO. Fra Luke, Fra Luke! pray Heaven to yield us strength. We have most painful duties to perform. FRA LUKE. My nightly prayer is that your Highness ever May—as you do—perform them. FRANCESCO. I have pledged The mother of that lad, she shall not lack Justice. But we must have no public prate. It must be done discreetly. FRA LUKE. What lad, Master? FRANCESCO. That—Page of Isabella's—what's his name? Lelio, I think—that Troïlo Orsini Most impudently did assassinate With no consideration for ourselves, Nor for the Church of God.—For, think, Fra Luke! The brat was stabb'd in our own livery, And died before he could his sins confess, In our own sister's house—before her face— By day—and on a Sunday! What's the hour? FRA LUKE. Nigh midnight, by the Duomo clock. I heard Three quarters striking to the middle night, A little while before your Highness knock'd. FRANCESCO. I'll see him now, then. Go. The south-west wing, (But not by the grand staircase, for your life!) There's, in the little chamber, where last stood That vase I sent His Catholic Majesty, —My porcelain—you remember?—the new shape— Now waiting—you shall know him by the plume— A white one—in his hat—a man much injured: Our sister's husband, Paolo Giordano Orsini, of Bracciano. Bring him here By the mask'd stairway. And be careful, Monk, To slip the spear back in the Cupid's hand That's last of all the group, which, cluster'd, hides The spring I show'd you, that unlocks the door Between the two great mirrors. (Twenty Loves Fighting a hare: Bianca's notion that, And Venice work.) The Duke and I have business, And you will find him waiting. Go. FRA LUKE. Your Highness, Like the true artist, no detail neglects, But your least work is thorough. FRANCESCO. Flatterer! We all must do what little good we can. Life is so short! Be quick. FRA LUKE. (More murder!) Sir Your Highness shall not wait. I'll bring the Duke. Exit Fra Luke. FRANCESCO. (alone.) Ay. Life is short, so short! Brief, brief and evil! Oh what a business have I here, to purge Of its bad blood this fat and pursy time, And keep a decent cleanness in my Court! When am I ever idle? Where's the Prince In Christendom, whatever Philip says, That's more decorous, or more circumspect Than I, more nicely careful to maintain Proper appearances in men and things, And yet withal,—the shame of it's in that,— More harass'd in his house by kindred more Disorderly, more thankless! Ferdinand, —And he a Cardinal, and my heir—that's worse! Curse him! he's nothing but a conduit, he, Perpetually conducting Christian coin Out of the coffers of my careful thrift Into the greasy purses of the Jews: Making himself (a pillar of the Church!) Chief corner-stone o' the new Jerusalem. Small thanks to him, if I myself some day Be not in Abraham's bosom! Heaven knows how My substance goes to fatten Abraham's seed. And the rogues multiply! Abram begets Isaac, and Isaac Jacob. Pietro too, The most unblushing profligate that breathes, Connives, unshamed, at his own cuckledom! And sister Isabella . . . . 'sdeath! I'll make A clean sweep this time. Let them look to it. 'Sdeath! even Philip shall be satisfied. [The clock strikes outside from the Duomo. Hark! there's another day gone. Coin by coin, The scrupulous Time tells out his sounding sum, And rings the tested metal, that he owes Eternity, that usurer of life, Which, lending little, takes our all at last, And gives back nothing got. Go, coin of time, No longer current! pay in part life's loan. Go, with the image of a Christian Prince Stamp'd on thee, to the treasury of Heaven! Bear witness for me to the King of Kings, That I, Francesco dei Medici, Grand Duke of Florence by the grace of God, That grace requite by no disgraceful rule, Uphold the Church, promote Religion, keep Morality respected, and pluck off Even from the cherisht body of my House Offending limbs. Bear witness there's no deed Done in the dark against Heaven's Throne, or mine, (Which to keep heavenly white is my desire,) But I have eyes to see it, and no place On earth so distant, where ill-doers hide, But I have arms to reach it. Welcome, Duke! BRACCIANO. (entering with fra luke). Your Highness' humble servant. What strange place Is this I stand in? FRANCESCO. The State's workshop, Sir. Good simple soldier, in this little cell The spider, Policy, all arms, all eyes, Spins, unperceived, the crafty web that takes That buzzing fool, the world. My father, Duke, He was a man by all mankind esteem'd Most fortunate. His hair, before its time, Grew grey with study. Study of what, you wonder? Chemicals. Studied where? Here, in this cell. Chemistry, Soldier, trust me, is a science Which now-a-days we sceptred students need To study more than your rough art of war. But that's beyond. Be seated, brave Bracciano. We prove our love and confidence in you, Seeing you here, where few have seen us. Sit. BRACCIANO. I wait your Highness' orders. FRANCESCO. True. But stay, You have not slept upon the road from Rome. For that we thank you. 'Twas not without cause That our despatch was urgent. But, no doubt, You must be tired and hungry, and in need Of some refreshment. Ope the door, Fra Luke. There's supper in the anteroom. BRACCIANO. No, no! I am not hungry. I have supp'd elsewhere. I thank your Highness, but— FRANCESCO. Tut! tut! a glass Of Cyprus wine? a brace of beccafiche? BRACCIANO. My Lord, no, thank you. Savory tho' they be, These chemicals of yours scarce whet the edge Of a man's appetite: and as for me, I have about me no digestive stuff, No spider paste, no powder'd unicorn horn, Or any other kind of stimulant Against a too-long after-dinner sleep. FRANCESCO. Ha, ha, Bracciano! ever sharp and merry! BRACCIANO. No, Sir. Most sad and sober. You were pleased To invite me hither with some urgency Which yet I know no cause for. Being come From Rome in haste to hear them, I now wait Your Highness' orders. FRANCESCO. Leave us, then, Fra Luke. You shall be satisfied, good brother-in-law. A word, Fra Luke! Your pardon, dear Orsini. But if you knew what lovers you have here (I and Fra Luke. Is it not so, Fra Luke?) Of the true masters of the Tuscan tongue! There's in our private library, Fra Luke, Fresh from the printer's hand . . . . what type! what type! The purified and expurgated text, —'Tis by the Cavaliere Leonardo,— Of the Decameron of Boccaccio. Be good enough to look at it. One thing Is sure, at least,—you will admire the type. And let us know your mind upon the text Presently. On the whole, it seems to us The Cavaliere has succeeded well, And with no common skill, in no slight task. So many shocking and unseemly parts In the first nude robustness of the text Needing to be decorously conceal'd In flowers of language carefully arranged, Or from the body of the book removed Wholly, with such incision nice as leaves No beauty blemish'd. Look at it, Fra Luke. Oh, what a fallen thing is Human Nature! Alas, alas, Fra Luke! is it not sad That such a genius, such a man as this Messer Giovanni, should be damn'd? And yet, What can we think, Fra Luke? what must we fear? Such genius with such immorality! Sad! sad! FRA LUKE. The Almighty knows the world too well To expect five legs of mutton from a sheep. The best of us, in our imperfectness, Must largely count upon that tolerance In Him that, having made, best knows, mankind. But, may it please your Highness, there's no doubt Messer Giovanni did repent his sins Upon his death-bed, and so pass'd in peace. FRANCESCO. Are you quite sure of that? I am very glad. A man of so much genius! And you say He saw, at last, Fra Luke, and did repent, The many errors of his pen? Well, well, Morality thus triumphs at the last. It comforts me to think he is not damn'd. May it be true! BRACCIANO. ('Sblood! am I his tame hawk? To be held hooded on the hand of him, While he—the pepper merchant—) I remind Your Highness that, not having yet the honour To be a lackey of the Medici, I lack that patientness which, as it seems, Such office craves. FRANCESCO. Indeed? [In his ear, after surveying him a moment in silence. Restrain this fire A moment. We must fuel it anon. Off then, Fra Luke, into the Library! Peruse Boccaccio till we call. FRA LUKE. I go, Sir. (The spider and the wasp. I back the spider.) [Exit Fra Luke. FRANCESCO. Be seated, Duke. Be seated. Now, to business. [After a pause. Duke of Bracciano, our good brother-in-law, It needs not now that we remember you Of our past loves, and care for your good name: Whose house so neighbours ours, that fire lit there Must burn ourselves. BRACCIANO. I know your Highness' goodness, And—as it merits—thank it. Pray, my lord, Come quickly to the matter. FRANCESCO. Sir, at once. Which, were it less notorious than we know it, I could have fain forgotten. O my lord, We are the laughingstock of this lewd town! I am in you offended, you in me. Our most unworthy sister—your worse wife— O'ertasks the common tongue to count up all Her manifold misconducts. BRACCIANO. Isabella! FRANCESCO. No better than a strumpet, good Bracciano. BRACCIANO. Uncivil Sir, he lives not that dare say it! Were't in the Duomo's self, I'd strangle him. FRANCESCO. O much, my lord, I must lament the cause, As much I do admire your noble anger. And then, to think the traitor lives— BRACCIANO. His name? FRANCESCO. Who hath so wickedly abused your faith Too fondly given—all ties of blood—all titles That honour's held by— BRACCIANO. Hell, and all its devils! His name? his name? FRANCESCO. Ay, that's the worst of all. BRACCIANO. I am stifling. FRANCESCO. Tho' the town might tell it thee. BRACCIANO. The name, Grand Duke of Florence? FRANCESCO. Troïlo Orsini, and thy cousin. BRACCIANO. Troïlo! FRANCESCO. Most basely hath betray'd you. BRACCIANO. Bear with me. FRANCESCO. Ay. Realise that first. It will take time. For such things toughly task credulity In all men's natures, but the soldier's most; Whose noble wont is never to expect The blow that stabs behind. But, for the proofs Of this bad truth . . . no matter! they can wait. Duke, I have brooded on these wrongs of yours Till . . . BRACCIANO. Yes. I understand. In such a place As this . . . what must I call it, Duke of Florence? FRANCESCO. Grand Duke, Orsini. BRACCIANO. Certainly. Most grand! In this detestable den of yours, I say, Where nothing wholesome is, nought's natural But what is wholly monstrous. Here you hatch Each chance-spawn'd slander of the chattering town, Shut in this stew where no good air is breathed, Where each vile fancy cooks her fœtid eggs, Where all abominable thoughts are brew'd, Until at last, from brooding on these things, These lies . . . FRANCESCO. Bracciano! BRACCIANO. If you spake the truth Your countenance . . . FRANCESCO. Be still, unhappy man! By Bacchus! married men are mostly fools, But you are an amazing maniac. BRACCIANO. Troïlo? Now I'll tell you why I know That is a lie. When he and I were boys— FRANCESCO. When you and he were boys! Are you a man? BRACCIANO. Ay, and at nature's manly bidding spurn The lie which wrongs all natural manliness. You are deceived, my lord. I'll not believe it. FRANCESCO. You are deceived. Most wickedly deceived. BRACCIANO. I'll not believe it. FRANCESCO. Duke you will: tho' now You would not. O unhappy infidel, Already all the town doth pity thee. BRACCIANO. That cannot be. Were this the stalèd jest Of street and tavern, as your talk implies, I should, myself, have heard it. FRANCESCO. What, at Rome? BRACCIANO. Why not at Rome? There's talk enough in Rome? That's little to the credit, as it goes, Of the illustrious family of my wife. FRANCESCO. My lord, we know it. More behoves it us To silence this same talk. But married men Are a strange kind of asses with short ears That are not quickly tickled by such talk. It is the mercy, Duke, of Providence That made them thus. BRACCIANO. Prince, you may be deceived. Even Princes know not everything. FRANCESCO. Ay, Duke. But one—Francesco dei Medici— Knows everything—at least in Florence. Much To you and me, my lord, it matters not If true or false the talk of florence town. The talking town talks of us. That's enough. The fault of that's in Isabella now. If talk goes on, the fault will be in us. For we are gentlemen and Christians, Duke. I have a brother's duty to perform, And you a husband's. But the talk's all true, It happens, this time. By and by peruse These papers, Duke. And learn betimes to know That I know everything. BRACCIANO. Most wretched man, Thou buyest thy knowledge at too dear a price! That which we know must make us ignorant Of happiness for ever: ignorant Of wholesome human faith for evermore. O God, the misery of knowing this! The misery of it! FRANCESCO. Ay. 'Tis bad enough. You see, that rascal Troïlo has spoil'd all Our care to keep things quiet. But for this We might have let your Duchess grow in peace That crop of horns for her wise husband's head, Which now, I fear, must off with some sharp lopping. But he, the fool, for stupid jealousy Of some well-looking lad, a sort of Page Of Isabel's, I think,—no name, no name,— Good honest country folk his kindred are, And scandalized amazingly,—almost It makes me smile, their infinite surprise And indignation at what, after all, Was, tho' on his part an immense mistake, Yet, in its way, a kind of compliment From such a man as your illustrious cousin To their unlucky kinsman: but, you see, As I was telling you, from jealousy This foolish Troïlo has stabb'd the youth, Almost in public. And, in short, the thing Has made an ugly talk about us all. And this dead cub's curst dam is shrieking out For law, and justice, and the devil knows what, To me, Grand Duke of Florence. BRACCIANO. Troïlo! The gentle, ever-quiet, small, weak boy I used to carry, when we two were young, Upon my back—barefooted I, and he Hugging my neck, while, like a wise church daw, He chatter'd, with sagacious spriteliness (The sagest little man that ever was!) High up the mountain torrents! Troïlo, Him that I taught to ride, to fence, to swim, And never yet could teach an evil thing, Rebuked, as well my boisterous youth might be, By that girl's face of his! My Troïlo, My more than cousin, sister-brother! he To whose chaste woman-hands I gave in charge, As to a saint's, my honour and my home! FRANCESCO. Most villanously hath betray'd them both. Bracciano, milk that's spilt . . . You know the proverb. Think only how you best may be avenged. BRACCIANO. Avenged? on whom? on what? On all mankind, For being what I now must deem men all, Traitors and knaves? No better, sure, the rest, Than my most trusted friend! All women, too? For being—what my wife has proved they are, That was the best of them I ever knew! Vengeance? on all the world! for all the world Is my wrong-doer,—suffering such wrongs in it. Vengeance? on Heaven! that made, and yet maintains, So vile a world as this. O where, where, where, In all the armoury of human wrath At most inhuman wrongs, shall I find arms Enough for such a vengeance? FRANCESCO. Stoop thine ear. Stay! let me first make sure we are unheard. Keyholes have ears: those ears have tongues: those tongues Utterance: and I, myself, the great arch spy, From parasitic spies am never free. No! I have tried the doors. All's fast. This way. Now listen. [Whispers. BRACCIANO. Devil! thou hast pour'd hellfire Into my veins! FRANCESCO. Thou hast no choice, Bracciano. BRACCIANO. Forbid it Heaven! FRANCESCO. Oh, Heaven doth forbid it, But Isabel hath done it. BRACCIANO. Misery! FRANCESCO. Undoubtedly. But duty, not the less. Duty, Bracciano, duty! BRACCIANO. And my boy, My innocent brat! When he shall ask one day ‘Father, where is my mother?’ God will listen, And only Hell dare answer! FRANCESCO. Bah! Myself, I'll answer. Tush, the boy need never know: Or, knowing it, he shall approve the deed. I'll educate him. BRACCIANO. You? And after death Must come the judgment. FRANCESCO. She is judged already. 'Sdeath, Duke! What wrongs are mine to match with yours? Yet she I sacrifice to your just wrath And righteous vengeance, is my sister. BRACCIANO. Ay, But not the mother of thy children. Oh, If they must lose their lives, all they whose names Are lost in credit by a losel tongue, There'll be none living left to slay the rest. Why should I rashly ratify the word Of the unthinking rabble? FRANCESCO. Cæsar's wife (Remember, Duke, what Suetonius says) He suffer'd not to be suspected even. BRACCIANO. Ay, man. But still, he did not murder her. FRANCESCO. Hush! murder's not the word. BRACCIANO. Oh, judgment, is it? Just judges are we, I and thou, Francesco! Listen to me, Sir. I'm no hypocrite. Whose fault was, first of all, this hideous coil? Oh, do you think that I deceive myself Enough to be deceived by you? Sir, hear me. Here was I, Head of the Orsini, son Of a long line of ducal sires, whose names Were old,—incalculably old, I say, Before the first small Medici was dropt Into this world, by chance, to make what way Chance still might help him to find out, thro' it. So far, so well. What, then, was mine, to want? Money. To get which, what was mine to give? Just this same ducal name, and lineage old, With something here and there in men's esteem, Which, born with these, Wealth, born without it, buys. You had the wealth, you Medici: and I What, needing wealth, is still by wealth desired. So I said,—or, to say the truth, not I— But all friends said to me—‘This Isabel, A daughter of the Medici, is rich, Young, too, and beautiful as all admit, Secure the money with the girl, Orsini!’ And you,—illustrious pepper-merchants all, Pray what said you? Oh, ‘Let him take the girl, And take the money, whereby we take him, The threadbare duke, with his unbroken line And broken castles,—just the man we want!’ So much for us. The world, of course, cried Bravo! Clapp'd hands, extoll'd the ‘Suitable Alliance.’ Which one of all of us once asked himself ‘But what, for her part, does the lady gain? Has she, by chance, a heart? and what says that? Well, I believe that I have been no worse, If, at the best, no better on the whole, Than other men thus suitably allied. I liked my wife, admired, respected her; Took it for granted she should be content To fill the proper place up in my life Where she was wanted, and remain therein, Just as you take for granted, the stone saint Will stay, and decently demean himself, In that particular cathedral niche The architect allots him, heeding not The dulness or the chilness of the place. And when, to crown it all, there came an heir Both to the money, and the name to boot, Content with that result, which seem'd the end, Small further care about my wife had I, Than to select the best man I could find (He seem'd so then) to take up and perform The duties,—(mark! not daring to desire The dear reward love's care of love receives,—) Of guardian of the honour of a wife Whose spouse . . . Oh, there's no dearth of weighty cause For my continued absence: fame, the field, The Church's banner, then, the friendship vow'd Don John, Lepanto—man's career in short! Of course, meanwhile, with business pleasure goes: Of course I have my mistresses: my wife No doubt has heard the Accorombona's name: But that's a trifle. All's allow'd to men. Of course a wife in fault has no excuse. Of course, altho' we rate the women all As three times weaker than our worthless selves, We yet expect, we have the right to expect, That they shall be thrice stronger. Wherefore not? Man can appeal to man. Woman to whom? Man's both her judge and executioner. Woe to her if she slips! Just judges we! FRANCESCO. Bracciano, all this. . . . . BRACCIANO. Interrupt me not! You're in the way of it. Your turn is coming. For what was my worst, maddest, wickedest Of all mistakes? To dream that I could leave, Even for an hour, with hope to find again, Man's honesty or woman's virtue, here In the foul precincts of this cursèd Court, Where all the air's one malady, and all That breathe it are distemper'd! here, I say, Where every shape and kind of wickedness, For which the name's to find yet, grows and thrives, And at the top of all its hateful growth, Fed with the sinful sap of all the rest, Puts forth the crowning vice—Hypocrisy! Ha, ha! Grand Duke of Florence, I thank God For one thing heartily! I have made you wince, And writhe, like the tormented snake you are. You hate me: and I know a way to hurt you: That comforts me a little. Hypocrite! Do you begin to feel that, after all, The Devil's not so safe in Hell, but what A ray of Heaven gets at him now and then, And stings him thro' all custom? FRANCESCO. Madman, and fool! Do you forget that you are in my power? BRACCIANO. I forget nothing. But you lie, Grand Duke. Out of your power I have pass'd away Forever, and you know it, this sad night. How can you hurt me? you have done your worst. You cannot hurt my wife. I have no wife. My son? I know not if I have a son. The adulteress has one. Would you hurt my friends? There's no man in the world I love or trust. My name? Disgraced already, you aver. My life? What's life worth, lacking what mine lacks? But you'll not take my life. First, for you cannot. Easier could I kill you than you kill me. We are alone, just now. Besides, I know, And you know, that you dare not. Still to you My life's more useful than my death can be. To me 'tis useless now. Away with lies, So thoroughly worn-out, they but show the truth They should conceal! Francesco, to speak plain, We do not love each other, never did; But all we ever had in common still Remains to us. Community of wrong. FRANCESCO. Community of interest. BRACCIANO. As you please. And so to finish this vile work of ours. Only, for Heaven's sake, Sir, no fine names! If all that you have said be true . . . FRANCESCO. It is. Convince yourself. The proofs are in your hand. BRACCIANO. Presently. 'Tis the custom of our House. And I'll have surer warrant. Her own lips, Not mine—not yours—no lips, no lips but hers Shall sound the sentence, if confess'd the crime. My sentence! For the punishment is mine, As mine the fault was. She must die. FRANCESCO. That's sense. BRACCIANO. Die! yes. And then my punishment begins. For I must live. There's punishment for both. Duke, . . . you have dealings with that sort of—men I would not call them: yet there's ne'er a rogue In Florence, but, I doubt not he is worth As much as any other honest man! Pray, did you ever notice carefully A hangman's countenance? I try to think That I am altogether pass'd away So far out of all human sense of what My misery is, that I may dare assume The inexorably stern judicial mood Of God's Destroying Angel. You are witness I have already judged, and have condemn'd, Myself,—or rather say, the man I was Once, and can never be again. Not he, I try to think,—not he, but that man's judge, Ascends the justice seat and summons forth Unhappy Isabella to her doom. But there's a something left of man in me —I know not what—'tis strangely out of place— That troubles all. And, turn which way I will, These hands of mine still seem a hangman's hands, And we two, here, conspirators—worse, worse, Cut-throats! and she our victim. Why is that? FRANCESCO. Because you are a simpleton. Because Your mind, just now, puts all things out of place, And your life's habit has not help'd your will To put them promptly in their places back. I see in all this,—and see noting else— Plainly, a duty,—painful, I admit, Painful to me, no less, Sir, than to you, But still, a duty, to be done, and done At once, and once done, straight from thought dismiss'd. The duty's ours: the consequence is not. Was Abraham careful of the consequence When, to please God, he sacrificed his son? Or did he call himself a murderer? Yet Abraham's son was guiltless. As for you, Your wife is guilty. There's no doubt of that. You choose to call merely ‘fine names’ what are Really fine feelings. You are thoroughly wrong: For are we Christian gentlemen, or not? That's the sole point, Duke. BRACCIANO. If we be, I say God help the times! FRANCESCO. Amen. God help the times! God help us all! And most of all, help me! That have the most to bear of all of you. And, Duke, you wrong me. Hypocrite I'm not. The world leaves its chief actors no such choice As you may fancy, how to act their parts. Dissimulation is imposed on us. And let me tell you, there are certain signs Already, in the crowd,—I can't say what, I feel them,—that our parts must be played off Quickly. I think I can, at times, detect A certain ominous stir about the mass: Strange faces with uncomfortable eyes: New comers, whom their places do not please: Vague sounds not wholly satisfactory: A restlessness that . . . Well, it matters not! I shall have play'd my part out, anyhow. Let after comers manage as they may. Our stage is old. One of these days, perchance, It may give way, and there'll be broken bones. I shall have strutted off it. Hypocrite I am not. But profound dissimulator, Yes. That's my part. And hypocrite to you! To you at least I have been frank enough. Outspoken, like the friendly gentleman You'll have occasion yet to find I am. But your unhappy state excuses all. You'll sober, and be sorry by and by. In thus consulting you, thus timely, thus Freely and unreservedly, on what Is after all a matter that concerns, With or without your leave, or any man's, Ourselves in chief,—(for Isabel's our stuff) We think that we have shown you full regard, Friendly and honourable confidence, Deserving recognition. Aught, unknown To you, we would not willingly have done. But, knowing what you know, if it would ease The sort of natural trouble your unuse To such necessities now suffers, Duke, We'll rid your hands of what remains to do And undertake . . . BRACCIANO. No, no! not you! not you! To you 'twould be no punishment. To me 'Tis punishment already. FRANCESCO. As you will. But you're so hot! You'll blunder I half fear. I need not say, do nothing unconvinced. Convinced you will be. But remember, Duke, No public talk, no scandal! Nothing rude, Conspicuous, unseemly! What's to do Must be discreetly done. Ha, by the way, My brother Ferdinand writes me word, Bracciano, That you are much indebted: sorely prest To make good certain obligations due, Nor longer now renewable. Is that true? BRACCIANO. Pish! yes. FRANCESCO. Well, Duke, we'll settle this for you. Count up your debts. Ah, if you only knew How you have wrong'd us? But you'll find that out. Count up your debts. We'll pay them. BRACCIANO. Peace! What's left For me to care for? Let the roof-tree fall, Now all beneath it's buried! all, all, all! FRANCESCO. You must not think of things so sullenly. But as a man that's master of his wrongs, And greater even than the greatness of them. Rouse! rouse! BRACCIANO. Francesco, I will tell you now A thing will give you pleasure. Take it, fiend! 'Tis the last pleasure you will get from me. I think, if I were capable just now Of any feeling in the least like joy, 'Twould be to know that you were miserable Beyond endurance: therefore I suppose, Since no less cordially do you hate me Than I hate you, 'twill give you pleasure too, To hear what I shall say. I said erewhile I liked my wife, admired, respected her. That's over. I can not respect her now, Admire, or like her. All that's worlds away! But what do you suppose I am going to do Presently, when I leave this den? To murder The woman that I love! love, love, do you hear? I never loved her when I thought her pure. I know her not pure now. I love her now. And I am going to murder her. Laugh, Fiend! You see that I am miserable enough. Make much of that. Mine she was yesterday, And yesterday I was an honest man. I did not love her then. I loved myself. All's changed. She is mine no more: we both are lost. For, losing her, I have lost myself. To-night I, with the murderer's heart in me already, Love her, the harlot that I go to kill. Have that writ down by some choice Tuscan scribe, A drama for the devil to chuckle at: A devil's drama, for a devil's delight, Acted by devils damn'd beyond redemption! FRANCESCO. The heart of man's a mystery! BRACCIANO. All's so clear! The Might-have-been, which never can be now, The Must-be-now, which never could have been, Were't not that knowledge ever comes too late, And all that's good is, in this wretched world, Good miss'd! Why came I in such haste from Rome? Not at your mandate: tho' your missive seem'd The pretext still. For I was thoroughly tired Of what had been. 'Tis not, I think, in you To understand how it should come about That sometimes in the sudden midst of all The busy so-call'd waking life of a man, There slides across the spirit that's moving it A silent instantaneous dreamlike change: Born, as in dreams such changes are, perchance Of something, Heaven knows what, so small, so small, That with a mystic trouble turns aside Suddenly the main currents of the mind: The look in a dog's eyes: a stranger's talk: The death of some man that you never knew: Less, less than that! chance odours after rain, Or old-new colours in an evening sky, And all at once the Present is the Past, The Past the Present, and the Future all One nameless yearning to recapture . . . what? Ah that's the question! But with me 'twas Home, A resting from the nowhere-leading ways Of feverish Life's sick walking up and down, Peace, and the quiet-hearted household loves! FRANCESCO. Marry again then! BRACCIANO. Plaudite! valete! All's as it should be here. The play's complete. Look round, admire the order of the parts! Is not all Florence represented here? The art of murdering and concealing murder, Call'd statecraft by this time's complacent voice, Behold, on yonder silent shelves all round, Its speechless representatives! The rest? Oh, all the rest's in our two persons play'd! Behold the Personages of the Age: Conspirator, Assassin, Hypocrite, Prince without truth, and Subject without trust. As for the People, it is quite as much Visible here as elsewhere, just at present: The People's part is properly left out: The Prostitute's behind the scenes: the Spy, The Cuckold,—all are here I think, and all Are represented worthily. What else Is wanting? FRANCESCO. Ho! Fra Luke! BRACCIANO. True, I forgot. The Church! FRANCESCO. What ho! Fra Luke! Fra Luke, I say! FRA LUKE (entering). (They have not kill'd each other? no such luck! I had a vague sweet hope of some such thing.) Your Highness call'd me? FRANCESCO. Well? The New Edition? What of it, Friar? FRA LUKE. I like ever best Each last Edition of what I may call Your Highness' careful study and extreme care To improve, suppress, eradicate what needs The pruning-knife of strict Morality, This world's rank garden's wary weeder. FRANCESCO. Ah! I am glad that we appear to have done well. Dear, dear Bracciano! so then you must go? Well, 'twere but cruel kindness on our part To keep you any longer from the home Where those that love you there have so long miss'd Your welcome presence. Oh, Sir, we expect To hear of famous doings presently,— Prompt slaying of the fatted calf,—what not? All sorts of welcomes to this best event! Heaven bless you, dear Bracciano! FRA LUKE. (Strange! He knows That I know all. Yet, for the life of him, The habit of hypocrisy so sticks, He cannot help pretending to deceive me.) FRANCESCO. Conduct the Duke, Fra Luke. The Duke's impatient. And, dear Bracciano, I'm so glad, so glad That, as regards the trifle we discuss'd, We are of one mind wholly. And the money, The money shall be paid. Zounds! it would be Abominable, unchristian, if we left In the curst clutches of those rascally Jews A moment longer our dear sister's husband. Go! joy be with you. Stay, one parting word! When of the odious truth you are assured, I pray you, Sir, remember that you are A gentleman and a Christian. BRACCIANO. Heaven and earth! FRA LUKE. (I back'd the spider. Well, the spider wins!) This way, illustrious Senior Duke! this way. [Exeunt Bracciano and Fra Luke. FRANCESCO. (alone.) Bluster! all bluster! For I hold him fast. Astonishing! how soon a man forgets Debts to Despair. Before a month is past I shall be pray'd to pay his other debts, Almost as desperate. They are all the same. 'Twere well to have him watch'd, tho', till he's tame. Poor fellow! 'tis so fresh to him, all this. Well, now that's off our mind which weighs on his. Suscipiunt montes pacem populo! Servite Dominum in lætitiâ. So Jacta est alea, the bolt is sped. A litany now: and then, content, to bed! VANINI Lucilio (self-styled Julius Cæsar, and Pompeius) Vanini, was one of that numerous Army of Martyrs who have been canonized by no Church. Murdered by the Parliament of Toulouse upon an infamous and unfounded charge of Atheism, his memory has been calumniated by the few and forgotten by the many. I think that no reader of his ‘Dialogues’ will accuse me of exaggerating the vanity of the man. It was excessive, but not ignoble: and to it I am disposed to attribute much of the heroism with which he endured torture and faced death. When we remember that his martyrdom and murder were justified by their perpetrators on the grounds of the audacious freedom with which Vanini had expressed unorthodox opinions, the excessive caution and timidity of all his writings significantly illustrate what was considered “Freedom of thought” in the Sixteenth Century. On being accused of Atheism by his judges, he picked a straw from the ground, and proceeded, by arguments which would probably have satisfied Paley, to demonstrate the existence of God from the existence of the straw. Those arguments, however, did not satisfy the Tribunal, which condemned him, first to have his tongue cut out, and then to be burned alive. He went through it all, and died, “cheerfully for the sake of Philosophy,” as he said, with a heroism, never surpassed and rarely equalled by any of those martyrs who are admired as brave men because they died in vindication—not of Doubt— but of a Faith, which promised them immediate beatitude. Yet consider the difference! LECTURES BEFORE THE SORBONNE. (PARIS, SIXTEENTH CENTURY.) Welcome, dear friends! . . . tho' to a stranger's heart! For, 'mid your fair French faces, as they throng Fast, fast about me, I perceive—if not The name of Italy encharacter'd, Such as her sultry suns with swarthy finger Upon my own have traced it—yet the eye Of keen enquiry, and the eager cheek, Native to such as nature's hand hews out From her unfeatured and inglorious mass, For common kindred in the shining band Of those that both desire, and dare, to know! Therefore, I take you to my heart of hearts: High peers, whose brows by Thought are privileged To owe no homage to the narrow zones Of partial Place, and casual Circumstance, But hold high colloquy with those supreme And solitary Spirits which allow No bondage of the branding zodiac To limit their hereditary realms In universal space! Therefore, I bid My best self, freely, to your fellowship: And, as, within the mystic circle traced By Persic priests, the affable Genius (Appeased by myrrhy fumes that please him well) Doth, to delight each mild-eyed Magian, Unpack the treasures of the ransackt world, Else hutcht from sight 'twixt either sleeping pole, —Gold, by wing'd gryphons for Abassin kings Guarded in mountain treasure-houses deep, Great wizard gems from Solomon's thumb ring, And sea-green marbles from Caucasian mines, Thick-vein'd with white fire;—so, sweet Mages, I, Lured by your loves, do at your feet lay low The spoils from Science filch'd by stealthy toil; Rare secrets of the starry universe, Flying around the centre, and what dwells Deep in the undivulgèd mind of man. I mark the wonder widening in your eyes As they turn to me, wistful what comes next; And hear you murmuring, as my spirit moves Among you like the unseen wind that blows To billowy toil full-bearded harvest fields. “Can it be true?” ye ask yourselves, . . . “The man Before you, with the scarcely-wrinkled brow And yet unsilver'd hair,—can he have reach'd So soon the cloudy summits that command That spacious prospect which the hoary sage Scarce sees before he sinks into the grave? How many cycles in the wilderness Did Moses wander, leading right and left His puzzled followers, till, fatigued to death, He, from the top of Pisgah gazing, saw The Promised Land, and died. yet hath the man That stands before you, speaking like a voice Out of the sunder'd stars, imperative, Some years of youth still left to fling away.” And so ye marvel. And I marvel not That ye delay to put aside all doubt. Because I know that half the Prophet's power Upon the multitude (tho' ye, indeed, I count not of the many, but the few) Lies in the lifted rod, the flowing robe, The hoary beard, and many-furrow'd brow. Yet, friends, 'tis true,—all true! The man ye see me, Such as I am, I have attain'd the end And eminence of all the sciences. A spirit zoned with the nine-folded spheres, That in his right hand turns the rolling globe Around, for pastime,—I command the Powers That hide within the heights and depths of things, Not easily commanded. In a word, Whatever may be known by man, I know. Yes! I, the italian Doctor, Julius Cæsar Lucilio Vanini, whom you know Already by no casual report, Have by much study, travel, and strong thought, Master'd in some few thirty years, or less, Philosophy, and physics: medicals: Theology; and law, in both its branches, The civil and the canon (for who knows not That in utroque jure I am Doctor?) All schools of East or West: anatomy: Mechanics: mathematics: music: all Poets, grammarians, and historians: Natural magic, and astronomy, Astrology: with what from these a man May further fashion, in the advance of time, By sharp experience of himself, to add Knowledge to knowledge. Also I have writ On Free Will, Fate, and Providence, confuting Whatever was by others said before Upon these subjects, and constraining those That read my books to burn their own: besides Two dialogues on the contempt of glory Which, that I do not crave a vain renown But have sought Science for her own sweet sake, Shall witness for me to all candid minds: And,—so you shall not fear that I indulge Such froward spirit as our Holy Church Not seldom in her children hath reproved, Prodigals that forsake the Father's board To feed, and starve, on miserable husks, —A long Apology—Concilio Pro Tridentino—of the Council, and Decrees of Trent: with many other matters, Fully discoursed. Which books, whoe'er will read them, May at the Fair in Frankfort easily Obtain, thro' any merchant of this town. And I have visited the greater part Of Europe. I have traversed Italy, Whereof no city is to me unknown, Nor I to it. In Holland, Germany, And England, every University I have both seen, and sometime studied there. Nay, was I not the chosen and the chief Disciple of the English Carmelite John Bacon, prince of the Averröists? So that . . . albeit I would not have you deem I in pretension do exceed the pith And marrow of performance, nor indeed That, whatsoe'er it may be I have done, I have done more than any man may do, Let him but love, as I loved, Learning more Than house, or lands, or any other good, (Albeit such fervour is not to be found In men of insufficient elements) . . . . I dare affirm what I erewhile averr'd, That whatsoe'er a man may know, I know. And as for Pomponat, men's present Mentor, He, and Averröes, whom he but follows —(Altho' I would not count them less than kings Whose erudition and audacity Hath made them half to be esteem'd as gods) Let these, with Cardan, and I will not name How many more that be their vavasours, Sit at my feet forever, and be dumb! My worst is better than the best of theirs. (Believe I do not boast!) for they, indeed, Have but rough-guess'd the ways which I have paved With ponderous fact, and irrefragable Results, accumulated carefully, To distances divined not by these men. Which you shall also, if you will, reach with me: For what I know I would to all make known: And what I have would share with who will have it: Since knowledge by division grows to more. Is it not written that the Teachers—they That have turn'd many to the light—shall shine Like stars in heaven? Which shine not for themselves But for the illumination of mankind. Only believe me! Yet, for all, I see That you do think I boast myself beyond The stretch of my deserving. If, good friends, You deem it thus, believe me you do wrong Me first,—and, in the consequence, yourselves! For I conceive there's nothing more beseems A teacher, than assurance of the worth Of what he teaches, and his own to teach it. On these two points behoves the man to have No doubt whatever. If he doubt himself, Let him be dumb and put belief in others. For all his right to speak is in the right Of what he can speak to be boldly spoken: And, therefore, reverently listen'd to. Whence, if his worth be furnish'd with fair titles Both to his own, and other men's, good credence, He cannot too conspicuously show them. There's nought but such conviction as rejects All question of it, that what's now to say Is better worth the saying than all else By others said before it, justifies Infraction of that silence which befits A man in presence of the universe, The stars above him, and the graves below. Therefore, my masters, I am bold to speak: This boldness (which, were it less positive, Would stand in silence) being, as you see, The only right which I admit myself To speak at all. Be mine bold speech, or none. Oh! I have seen in Professorial Chairs How much of mock humility, lip-lowliness Mouthing it thus . . . . . ‘The Grace of God forbid ‘We should be overbold to lay rough hands On any man's opinion. For opinions Are, certes, venerable properties, And those which show the most decrepitude Should have the gentlest handling. Yes, good sirs, We have that sort of courtesy about us, We would not, flatly, call a fool a fool, Nor wrong all wrong, nor right entirely right, Lest we affirm too much. you shall not find us Of such an overweening arrogance That we should swear, because we are disposed To this or that conclusion, that it needs Must better yours. We think that we are right: We may be wrong: we doubt you are in error: You may be right. Civility forbids Insistance on harsh terms.’ Civility Therefore goes sidling, with a glance asquint 'Twixt true and false, along her slippery road, Which is the road to Hell, the Home of Lies! For wherefore should we call you here, to gaze In sober earnest, and some shuddering, Upon this dreadful combat of the gods, —This conflict of resistant Error arm'd Against resistless Truth, on all sides round, Not ended till the world be won or lost? Why bid you mark severe Minerva there? Here snaky Typhon,—both at horrible handgrips? If, to assuage amazement, and restore The careless satisfaction we were bold Thus to break-in on with the horrid news, We lightly whisper,—just when the heart stops And the veins tighten with the hideous thought Of what's depending on the deadly issue,— ‘Friends, here's no cause to fear yon grisly god, For all his savage show his claws be clipp'd. Athene's angry spear can draw no blood, It being button'd like your fencing foils. And this tremendous spectacle, which shakes The ample theatres of Heaven and Hell, Is but a mock-heroic at the most.’ Ye gods! if this be thus, and only thus, Why then, I cry i' the name of all men's patience, You impudent knaves that play the herald's part, Sound ye your brawling trumpets in our ears So shrilly? Why do you, unmannerly thus, Rouse us from slumber, scare us from our business Of feasting, fooling, and forgetting all things, To cry the house a-fire? Or why drag hither Grave men, grown men, grey men, with cares enough, And griefs enough, and grievances enough, To try the nerves of those that have the stoutest, Merely to cheat us of our hard-earned rest With your preposterous puppetings!Yet will some wise and moderate good man Make answer that to no one living soul Is absolute truth vouchsafed, and this alone Is absolutely certain. Granted, friend. Yet he is absolutely right or wrong That dares, or dares not, follow to the end And utterly use the whole o' the truth he hath. For there be many that, in face of Truth Fear her imperative aspect, and affirm ‘This customary falsehood is a thing More safe than that uncustomary truth,’ Or ‘only thus and thus much of the truth ‘Is competent of usage,’ having not Within themselves true love of truth, nor yet The courage of the consequence of thought. This is the approved philosophy of fools, Of which you shall hear nothing from my lips, For half-truths need no teaching from this chair. The craft of cowardice, the world's vile promptings, The glare of false authority, the fear Of exile, prisons, halters, and the rack, These teach the customary compromise Twixt true and false; and find in every land Sufficient school, without the added weight Of verdict from the lips of men, not vile By nature, who, tho' none regard their speech, Must speak undaunted, or not speak at all. Most men, indeed, believe in something better Than their own actions: and conciliate The world, by acting worse than they believe: And all men even their best actions base On something worse than is their best Belief: Yet hope to mollify the scorn of God, Because their thoughts are better than their acts, And their beliefs more blameless than their lives. This needs no teaching. This is the world's wisdom. But, when the Teacher speaks, he speaks as one That knows his audience in the universe Is not of this world only: but perchance Millions of starry spirits beyond the sun Pause o'er their planetary toil to lean And listen to him. If he speak the truth Truly, his speech is as a trenchant sword To cut the world asunder to the heart, And take its stealthy secrets by surprise. So let him stand up stern, as on a rock, Like Joshua when he held the sun and moon In Ajalon and Gibeon, till he ceased To smite the Amorite before the Lord. No more ignoble powers, no lesser laws Can hurt his sacred head whom Nature's own Eternal and divine supremacies Safeguard with unseen cohorts to the end. Good friends, I will not use you thus, I warrant you. But you shall have hard fighting, and real blows, Not dealt in vain. For, by the help of God, We will this day Goliaths more than one Destroy forever from the Field of Truth. —If you'll believe me! —Nay! but neither think, Because I have put off humility Before I stept into this Chair of Doctrine, That therefore I, with idle arrogance Aspire to hit the stars; revering not The worth of modest-mindedness in man. Not so. I have been humble more than most. Whiles I was yet a learning, I was humble. Then, my humility was such as suits A lover when he sues: which I put off To clothe me with the pride that lover feels When afterwards, he having won that woo'd, His love lives in possession. I might tell Of days and nights of painful patientness In Padua; when, a beardless boy, I braved Sharp winter's biting in a threadbare coat, And, late and early, trimm'd a lonely lamp With toilful tendance: sat at all men's feet: And read from all men's books right reverently: And lived to learn: and learn'd from all that lived: And held myself the least of little ones, Not worthy to be seated at the board, Grateful to cram what charitable crumbs Fell from o'erflowing trenchers to my lot; While nothing but the daily doled-out crust (A frail and miserable alms!) appeased The begging of the body, barely heard. But love makes warmth and fulness everywhere. The lover lives on love luxuriously, And lacks for nothing. O be very sure That no man will learn anything at all, Unless he first will learn humility. The humblest mounts the highest. Who would scale The skyey Alp must go afoot. The vain And arrogant man may drive his gilded coach Across the plain, gazed by the servile crowd, But, would he mount that mighty eminence, He must alight, and foot it with slow steps. Therefore I say . . . Be humble,—to be high! And I will tell you—I, that have, O friends, Read many books, and written not a few, —This is a secret. Tell it not in Gath, O very reverend Doctors of Sorbonne! A man may cram his brains with libraries, And yet know nothing. Whence comes Knowledge? think! By reading? No: by thinking on things read. By seeing? No: by thinking on things seen. Nor hearing, but by thinking on things heard. Yet half the first-class writers I have read Are merely setters forth—not of their own, But other men's stale thinkings: second-hand Employers of spent brains! Is Thought so easy? Try! Take some simple, obvious object here, And think it. Think the wall. What! you are silent? You cannot? Yet altho' you cannot think This simple wall that stares you in the face, You can think Plato and Pythagoras, Zeno, and Aristotle, Epicurus, Plotinus, Jamblicus, Themistius, Thales, Parmenides,—and the Lord knows whom. That is to say, you can think second-hand. Well then, O friends, now let us learn to think! Think anything. But only think. For, see you? There's nothing of so singular, nor mean Condition in this universe, but what It doth include, and, in a sort, continue The fact of something greater than itself, Nay, of the Very Greatest. Nothing is, But by the having been of something else, Which something else, the cause of this thing here, Is, in its turn, the effect of something elsewhere. Thus we the higher in the lower perceive: From each obtain intelligence of all: And find in all the consciousness of each. For all which is, by reason that it is, And is itself, not other than itself, Defines itself; and, being definite, Must be perceivable at some one point, If but no more, on which perception acts, Whether of bodily sense, or mental force. Away, then, with the indefinite, from thought, Which is the non-existent. What exists, Acts; and what acts gives notice of itself To all existence, acting thus or thus Conformably to laws that govern all Existence. Acts are laws: no law, no act. Therefore, be sure that whatsoever is Man's thought is competent, if not to know, At least to know of. And the Infinite Appears, reported by its parts, to be The Finite infinitely multiplied, Extended infinitely every way. Think, and all things become confederates To the thought in you. For the Thinking-Power Is of such pregnant faculty, it imbues All things, or can from all things extricate, And stir to answerable activity, Some portion of the essential consciousness. Upon the dumb, long inarticulate earth Descends the gift of prophecy and tongues: The smallest fact—the last in consequence Of the supreme procession of events, —Mere garniture of life's superfluous pomp, Becomes a willing spy upon the track Of its more potent predecessor, gone Most likely in a grand indifference by: The dust grows dainty with divinity: The limpet has surmises of the huge Enormous-back'd sea-violencing-whale: He, of Behemoth in the days when God Held colloquies upon the Chaldee plains With the vex'd Uzzite: the dull-hearted ox Hath in him legends of his father-race, Those monstrous and imaginary forms That frighten'd Adam when the bitten fruit Turn'd sour between his teeth, and thunder lower'd. The sandgrain in his dreams, divines the stars. The very stones are garrulously given And babble to each other in the moon The story of the waters that of old Roll'd Noë's ark on Ararat. Perchance The poising of a pebble that a child Sends from his sling in swift parabola, Interprets in a tongue that's yet to learn The fiat that gave motion to the stars. So that this volatile fluid of the brain This flux of thought, like streams compell'd to seek The level of their sources, flowing forth No matter by what channels, thro' what fields, Is by each course constrain'd towards the height From whence it issued, and mounts up to God. Ha! there you smile, and bring your faces all To bear on mine; like men who, unawares, And by a sudden happy chance, detect In some familiar object, grown a blank By being look'd at carelessly too often, A novel feature, not before divulged. Why, this is well. And, since we all are here To use our wits, friends, let us use them sharply And to some purpose: not as your mere swords Of ceremony, shut up safe in velvet, Tawdry and tedious appendages, Put on for show, and put aside for comfort! I see you take my humour by this time. Good! and your faces brighten, and your eyes Glitter, as stars do in a good sharp wind. Sharp? why, what else should be the atmosphere Of vigorous spirits? You believe me, friends? You do believe me! Ay, I always felt That I should find in France my own compeers, The finest and most eager spirits of men! Some guiding angel drew me in my dreams To choose this land for my abiding home. I loved you ere I knew you: know you now, And, having known you, love you better still. Gather, then, close about me, all of you! You, there, bright youth with sunbeams in your hair, And you, grave sir, with eyes like icicles, Come round me, one and all . . . close! closer still! Let not a word escape! We will discourse This day of the Eternal Providence. Clap all your pens to paper, and write down:— ‘Amphitheatrum Providentiæ Eternæ christiano-physicum, Divino-magicum, astrologico- Catholicum; adversus veteres Philosophos, peripateticos, Epicureos, atheos, stoicos.’ Good! Have you written? Now attend. We thus Begin with the Beginning. Which is God. JOHN PETER CARAFA. (HONORES MUTANT MORES.) A.D. 15—. [“Quelle . . . che sono fatti per amministrare le cose spirituali non hanno bisogno di niente.”—Letters of Cardinal Carafa. Caracciolo MSS. “Tal era il furore e la cupidigia dei Carafa, che pareva fossero tornati i tempi dei Borgia.”—Botta, Storia di Italia, lib. ix. p. 226.] 1 John Peter, Count of Madalone, son Of Count John Anthony Carafa, fled From Rome, indignant at the evil done By wolves that on the fold of Christ were fed: 2 And gave himself to Poverty and God: And with firm footstep, pure, severe, and sad, The untrodden paths of abnegation trod, Poor amidst wealth, and grieved by evil glad. 3 The fame of his fair life, and fervid faith, Grew with the growing evil of the time, And sounded as the archangelic breath, Blown thro' Heaven's trump, in challenge to Earth's crime. 4 The Holy Father of the Faithful thought ‘My counsellor shall be this saintly man, As God is his:’ and many a time besought John Peter's presence at the Vatican. 5 But to the sinful city he had fled With feet that, wing'd by indignation, shook Rome's dust away, the self-made exile said ‘The spirit that is within me will not brook 6 ‘To breathe the breath of thy polluted air.’ Howbeit, when God's Viceregent sent from Rome Command to him to come, in place of prayer, Loyal to his high lord, he groan'd ‘I come.’ 7 And, being at Rome, to one that loved him,—there He wrote . . . ‘In all this evil lump no leaven ‘Is left: but it is evil everywhere: And here man's heart fears neither Hell nor Heaven. 8 ‘My sister, I have lived to loathe this life, And call on Death to lead my spirit home. Death hears me not. God's will prolongs the strife My sad soul wages with the sins of Rome.’ Letters to his Sister: selected by M. Charles de Samm from the MS. collection of the Duke of Policastro. 9 Sometimes the high hand of His Holiness Doth, for the ennobling of the Church, dispense Honours whereby a good man's lowliness Is raised into a great man's Eminence: 10 But, in the Church's pious customs never (Nor the traditions, nor the usages Of immemorial Rome, wherein forever As the tradition so the usage is) 11 Prescription, precedent, or practice show'd That, if the head of its recipient Were housed in Rome, to the man's own abode A scarlet hat might properly be sent. “Jamais Pape n'avait envoyé la barrette à un prélat présent à Rome’, . . . . “Tel était la pauvreté du nouveau Cardinal qu'il n'y avait dans sa petite chambre de meuble convenable pour y poser la barrette, et qu'il n'avait rien à offrir à l'envoyé du Pape chargé de la lui remetter. Tout Rome en parlait et s'en etonnait.”—Caracciolo MS. 12 This pauper Priest was made a Cardinal: The Pope's own envoy bore the scarlet hat To his poor house: and found not wherewithal, (Save the one stool where its lone inmate sat) 13 In that bare lodge, that wanted all save worth, To place the gift: whose stern recipient gazed Ungladden'd, and from thankless doors drave forth The messenger unmonied and amazed. 14 At length one Pope, and then another, died: And Cardinal Carafa, after these, Became a Pope, himself. The whole world cried ‘'Tis well! for he is worthy of the keys.’ 15 Simple, austere, men knew him. Pure his name, And praised his virtues. Nobly born was he, Yet not ignobly known. His ample fame Was spotless. Worthier Pope there could not be. 16 ‘The luxury of the new Pope's table’ (writes Relazione di Bernardo Navigero. A Venice envoy to the Vatican) ‘Is more than may be dream'd of. All delights With all magnificences this proud man 17 ‘Mingles in one. The daintiest viands grace The costliest dishes, the most sumptuous wines From the most gorgeous goblets flow to chase Care from the banquet where his splendour shines: 18 ‘Good cheer he loves: and lustily he eats And deep he drinks: right royal is his tone: The mightiest monarchs of the world he treats As clots of common dust beneath his throne: 19 ‘His daily drink is butts of burning black Fierce Naples wine, and cups of Malvoisie. Methinks his belly is but a Bacchus' sack. And his least meal meats five and twenty be. 20 ‘Wondrous his wealth is. Of his noble birth So proud is he, and of his present state, That even as tho' he scorn'd to tread on earth Is the high going of his haughty gait. 21 ‘His nephews are the richest lords in Rome. And, for the greatness of the power they have, Many there be that flatter them, and some That in dark wishes dig them a deep grave.’ 22 Dame History is so old, she knows not well Present from Past. She loves to say her say Till it is stale, and the same story tell To-morrow as she told it yesterday. PICAROONS. 1593. 1 Who gallops by night, when the owl is about? O who, fellows, who but the bold Picaroon? Short shrift for the lord, and a rope for the lout, And 'tis merry to ride by the light of the moon, With hey, fellows, hey! 2 The Provost of Flanders look'd woeful to see (With hey, fellows, hey for the bold Picaroon!) Black Jack, his own knave, in the hollow oak tree Roasting alive by the light of the moon, With hey, fellows, hey! 3 Be it Dutchman or Spaniard, all fowl is fair game: Belted Flanders Militiaman: Brabant Dragoon: Where's the jack knave o' them fears not the name O' the roaming night-rider, the bold Picaroon? And hey, fellows, hey! CHRISTIAN, THE DOL-HARTZOG. (SO CALLED FROM HIS FURIOUS BEHAVIOUR.) 1660. Christian, Duke of Brunswick, and Bishop of Halberstadt, For a token of love, wore a lady's glove, in the loop of his riding-hat. For he had seen the Bohemian Queen in England; and, they say, In the sole soft part of his rock-rough heart, slept the memory of that day. For Christian, the Dol-Hartzog, was half a brute at the best, With but little space for a lady's face to lie and be loved in his breast. Yet he may have loved well, for he hated well (tho' he showed his hate like a beast, With tooth and claw), and the thing of things that he hated most was a priest. He maul'd the monk, and flay'd the friar, nor left the abbot a rag, And “Gottes Freund and Pfaffern Feind,” was the boast on his battle flag. Yet he worshipt God in his own wild way—as a beast might worship too— Simply by thoroughly doing the work which God had set him to do: With never a Pater noster said, never a candle burn'd, And never a pleni gratia, for any good gift return'd. Worship no better than any beast's! yet with reverence, too, to spare, Of its own dumb kind, in the silent mind, for what God made gentle and fair. At least, from one touch I argue as much in this wild man of Halberstadt, Since, for token of love, a pure lady's glove he wore in his riding-hat. Christian, the Dol-Hartzog, came riding to Paderborn; And his men were dropping for lack of bread, and his horses for lack of corn. Not a crown-piece in the coffer, either bread or corn to buy! “What shall we do, Duke Christian? ”“Anything, friends, but die!” “The Saints us save,” saith some one, “for we are weary and faint.” “'Sdeath! and so they shall, good fellows! Who is the Paderborn Saint?” “The Paderborn Saint is the Saint Liboire; and his image stands by itself As large as life in the church, all cover'd with jewels and pelf.” “The Saint Liboire is a saint of saints, for he to our pious wishes Shall accord a final miracle in the way of the loaves and fishes! Faith! since he hath jewels, and since he hath pelf, he shall buy us both bread and corn, And if ever I swear by a saint, it shall be by the Saint of Paderborn.” Christian, the Dol-Hartzog, rode on into Munster town, There, in the great Cathedral (greater for their renown!) Carven in silver, and cover'd with gold (truly a glorious band!) Round the altar, all in a row, the Twelve Apostles stand. Christian, the Dol-Hartzog, call'd his captains of war— “We will visit these Twelve Apostles, and see how their worships are,” Then they all went clanking together (godless knaves as they were) Over the sacred flintstones, up to the altar stair: Never a De profundis was heard, never an anthem sung, But where, thro' great glooms, 'twixt the solemn tombs, those iron footsteps rung, Each priest, like a ghost, from that grizzly host, patter'd off o'er the pavement stone, And the iron men and the silver saints stood face to face and alone. To that Sacred Dozen, thro' a silence frozen, strode the wild man of Halberstadt, As when Brennus the Gaul stalkt into the hall where the Roman senators sat. The Duke loves little speaking; but he made, that day, a speech To those Twelve Apostles, as pregnant as any the preacher can preach; For, “You Twelve Apostles,” said he, “for many a year and a day “How is it that you have dared your Master to disobey— Who bade you ‘ite per orbem,’ go about in the world where ye can, From city to city for ever, succouring every man? But you, yet unmoved by the mandate, you slothful and rascally crew! Stand there stock-still, letting others be stript to give succour to you. Therefore, about your business! down instantly all, and disperse! Comfort the needy! circulate freely! profit the universe! The better to serve which purpose, divinely ordain'd from of old, I hereby will and command both ye and your ill-gotten gold To assume the shape of Rix-thalers!” The Apostles had nothing to say, As it seems, in defence of themselves. They at least were obliged to obey. At dawn they were down from their niches; ere night on their mission they sped; And the broken were bound up and heal'd, and the hungry were speedily fed. This way Duke Christian affirm'd, little heeding Apostles or Priests, That the first great need of a man is—to feed: after the fashion of beasts! But, since even the beasts must work, Duke Christian thought, I suspect, If Apostles are made to work also, Apostles mustn't object. ELISABETTA SIRANI. Suggested by Mr. T. A. Trollope's charming Biography; which completely disproves the old story of the poisoning. 1665. Just to begin,—and end! so much,—no more! To touch upon the very point at last Where life should cling: to feel the solid shore Safe; where, the seething sea's strong toil o'erpast, Peace seem'd appointed; then, with all the store Half-undivulged of the glean'd ocean cast, Like a discouraged wave's, on the bleak strand, Where what appear'd some temple (whose glad Priest To gather ocean's sparkling gift should stand, Bidding the wearied wave, from toil releast, Sleep in the marble harbours bathed with bland And quiet sunshine, flowing from full east Among the laurels) proves the dull blind rock's Fantastic front,—to die, a disallow'd, Dasht purpose: which the scornful shore-cliff mocks, Even as it sinks; and all its wealth bestow'd In vain,—mere food to feed, perchance, stray flocks Of the coarse sea-gull! weaving its own shroud Of idle foam, swift ceasing to be seen! —Sad, sad, my father!...yet it comes to this. For I am dying. All that might have been— That must have been!...the days, so hard to miss, So sure to come!... eyes, lips, that seem'd to lean In on me at my work, and almost kiss The curls bow'd o'er it,...lost! Oh, never doubt I should have lived to know them all again, And from the crowd of praisers single out For special love those forms beheld so plain Beforehand. When my pictures, borne about Bologna, to the church doors, led their train Of kindling faces, turn'd, as by they go, Up to these windows,—standing at your side Unseen, to see them, I (be sure!) should know And welcome back those eyes and lips, descried Long since in fancy: for I loved them so, And so believed them! Think!...Bologna's pride My paintings!...Guido Reni's mantle mine... And I, the maiden artist, prized among The masters,...ah, that dream was too divine For earth to realize! I die so young, All this escapes me! God, the gift be Thine, Not man's, then...better so! That throbbing throng Of human faces fades out fast. Even yours, Belovèd ones, the inexorable Fate (For all our vow'd affections!) scarce endures About me. Must I go, then, desolate Out from among you? Nay, my work ensures Fit guerdon somewhere,—tho' the gift must wait! Had I lived longer, life would sure have set Earth's gift of fame in safety. But I die. Death must make safe the heavenly guerdon yet. I trusted time for immortality,— There was my error! Father, never let Doubt of reward confuse my memory! Besides,—I have done much: and what is done Is well done. All my heart conceived, my hand Made fast...mild martyr, saint, and weeping nun, And truncheon'd prince, and warrior with bold brand, Yet keep my life upon them;—as the sun, Tho' fallen below the limits of the land, Still sees on every form of purple cloud His painted presence. Flaring August's here, September's coming! Summer's broider'd shroud Is borne away in triumph by the year: Red Autumn drops, from all his branches bow'd, His careless wealth upon the costly bier. We must be cheerful. Set the casement wide. One last look o'er the places I have loved, One last long look!...Bologna, O my pride Among thy palaced streets! The days have moved Pleasantly o'er us. What has been denied To our endeavour? Life goes unreproved. To make the best of all things, is the best Of all means to be happy. This I know, But cannot phrase it finely. The night's rest The day's toil sweetens. Flowers are warm'd by snow. All's well God wills. Work out this grief. Joy's zest Itself is salted with a taste of woe. There's nothing comes to us may not be borne, Except a too great happiness. But this Comes rarely. Tho' I know that you will mourn The little maiden helpmate you must miss, Thanks be to God, I leave you not forlorn. There should be comfort in this dying kiss. Let Barbara keep my colours for herself. I'm sorry that Lucia went away In some unkindness. 'Twas a cheerful elf! Send her my scarlet ribands, mother; say I thought of her. My palette's on the shelf, Surprised, no doubt, at such long holiday. In the south window, on the easel, stands My picture for the Empress Eleänore, Still wanting some few touches, these weak hands Must leave to others. Yet there's time before The year ends. And the Empress' own commands You'll find in writing. Barbara's brush is more Like mine than Anna's; let her finish it. Oh,...and there's 'Maso our poor fisherman! You'll find my work done for him: something fit To hang among his nets: you liked the plan My fancy took to please our friend's dull wit, Scarce brighter than his old tin fishing can.... St. Margaret, stately as a ship full sail, Leading a dragon by an azure band; The ribbon flutters gaily in the gale: The monster follows the Saint's guiding hand, Wrinkled to one grim smile from head to tail: For in his horny hide his heart grows bland. —Where are you, dear ones?.... 'Tis the dull, faint chill, Which soon will shrivel into burning pain! Dear brother, sisters, father, mother—still Stand near me! While your faces fixt remain Within my sense, vague fears of unknown ill Are softly crowded out,...and yet, 'tis vain! Greet Giulio Banzi; greet Antonio; greet Bartolomeo, kindly. When I'm gone, And in the school-room, as of old, you meet, —Ah, yes! you'll miss a certain merry tone, A cheerful face, a smile that should complete The vague place in the household picture grown To an aspect so familiar, it seems strange That aught should alter there. Mere life, at least, Could not have brought the shadow of a change Across it. Safely the warm years encreast Among us. I have never sought to range From our small table at earth's general feast, To higher places: never loved but you, Dear family of friends, except my art: Nor any form save those my pencil drew E'er quiver'd in the quiet of my heart. I die a maiden to Madonna true, And would have so continued....There, the smart, The pang, the faintness!... Ever, as I lie Here, with the Autumn sunset on my face, And heavy in my curls (whilst it, and I, Together, slipping softly from the place We play'd in, pensively prepare to die) A low warm humming simmers in my ears, —Old summer afternoons! faint fragments rise Out of my broken life...at times appears Madonna, like a moon in mellow skies: The three Fates with the spindle and the shears: The Grand Duke Cosmo with the Destinies: St. Margaret with her dragon: fitful cheers Along the Via Urbana come and go: Bologna with her towers!...Then all grows dim, And shapes itself anew, softly and slow, To cloister'd glooms thro' which the silver hymn Eludes the sensitive silence; whilst below The south-west window, just one single, slim, And sleepy sunbeam, powders with waved gold A lane of gleamy mist along the gloom, Whereby to find its way, thro' manifold Magnificence, to Guido Reni's tomb, Which set in steadfast splendour, I behold. And all the while, I scent the incense fume, Till dizzy grows the brain, and dark the eye Beneath the eyelid. When the end is come, There, by his tomb (our master's) let me lie, Somewhere, not too far off; beneath the dome Of our own Lady of the Rosary: Safe, where old friends will pass; and still near home! RICHELIEU. I. THE POETS. 1 All she-creatures that exist Power can subdue, Save the Muse,—that could resist Cardinal Richelieu. 2 He the War of Thirty Years With his right hand led: Struck the turbulent French peers, With his left hand, dead. 3 Mad-dog Luther loosed to bite Emperor Charles and Rome: But the Huguenots held tight, Kennel-chain'd, at home. 4 Greatest man of many great! When to see him came The Queen Mother, forced to wait, Stood the royal dame: 5 Round him he, with haughty mien Rome's proud purple wrapp'd: Trembling stood the bare-head Queen: Richelieu sat capp'd. 6 Only little poets were Gombault, Desmarets, Colletet, and Boisrobert: Yet, whenever they 7 Came to see the Cardinal, Each kept on his hat. Proud as princes, one and all, These small poets sat: 8 And, while they in critic mood Did his rhymes review, Trembling and bare-headed stood Cardinal Richelieu. II THE THREE ESTATES. 1. The Cardinal to the Clergy cried “Six millions for the State!” The Archbishop of Sens replied “God save the King! the great And ancient rule hath been alway That for the Public Good The Clergy pray, the People pay, The Nobles give their blood.” 2. ‘Good!’ said the Spirit of the Age, ‘Give and take is a doctrine sage.’ 3. So, when the Royal Power had need Of more than priestly prayer, The Nobles for the Throne did bleed: And then the Nobles were The masters. When the Royal Power Said to the People ‘Pay!’ It was their dower that, from that hour, The masters rested they. 4. ‘Good!’ saith the Spirit of the Age, ‘Give and take is a doctrine sage.’ III. WALLENSTEIN'S DEATH. When Richelieu learn'd that Wallenstein was dead, His thin face sharpen'd to an edge. He said “Soon as the great tree falls, the rabble run To strip him of his branches one by one.” THE DAUPHIN. A Palace here, a People there, Face to face, i' the rainy air: For the rain is raining heavily, And the sick day shutting a bloodshot eye. The People, nowhere a while ago, Now here, now there, now everywhere. And, of all in the Palace, none doth know Where the People may be, ere is done This last of two disastrous days, Now waning fast, with watery rays. Quick, Fancy! ere its light be gone, From out of the many 'tis darkening on Save me a single face. This one. Broider'd of satin, as best befits, Is the gilded chair where the urchin sits, Whose grandsires all earth's greatest were In grandeur, when the grand were great. For the childhood of this child is heir To monarchy's old age. The late Sunbeam, now sinking in his hair (Weary of strife with a rainy sky) Faintly, solemnly, lingers there With a sorrowful glory, soon to die: As all things must, some day, whene'er Time disavows them: Time knows why. O'er kingdoms twain thou wert born to reign, Bourbon child of the Hapsburg mother! Life's fairest, one: and earth's, the other: France, and Youth. Of all the train Of those the wondering world admires, Lords and Ladies, Knights and Squires, Long-robed Senator severe, Royal Duke, and Princely Peer, —They whose heads be Heads of France, To whom, with a sullen countenance, Hungry hundreds crook the knee, None but boweth the head to thee, Little child! Whose face is one Of a group that all are gone. For, since thou, O child, didst flee, Who knows where? from human sight; Never child, kingborn, like thee, Hath been born to absolute right: Sons of kings no more can be Guaranteed, as thou wert then, Of the servitude of men. Hearest thou the sounds outside? Hearest thou the sounds within? In the neighbouring chamber Pride Stoops, in colloquy with Fear: Mounier's loyal cares begin: Prudence plucks at Lafayette: Orleans with sulky stride Is philosophising yet: Chartres has Louis by the ear: Necker rubs a ruminant chin. Outside in the twilight drear Swells the ominous surly din. See! the child is playing now With his sister's silky tresses: To whose infantine white brow Lips as white a mother presses. Are not children safe from harm, Circled by a mother's arm? In the chair where sits the child Smiling, long since sat and smiled Him men named the ‘Grand Monarque.’ Ah, the light is fading dark! Thro' the palace windows wide What is still so dim descried In the pale persistent rain? Is the deluge back again? And what wreckt world's groaning ark There emits its monstrous train To new-people earth with pain? Men or beasts? What are they? Mark! Seest thou? hear'st thou, little child? Haggard faces: women wild: Men red-handed, blood-defiled: Heroism, and Hope, and Hate, Hunger, Horror, Wrath, and Crime, Mingling in the march of Fate, Life's grotesque with Love's sublime: Ragged wretches grim and stark, Smiling as they never smiled Till this moment: jaw of shark Gaping at a drowning ship: Eye of tiger: lion's grip: Stormy starvelings, smutcht and soil'd, Thick thro' garden, court, and park, Round that palace terrace-piled, Teeming, tossing, trampling . . . Hark! First a growl, and then a howl, Voice of a vast tormented soul, And then a shrill heart-breaking bark, And now an immense murtherous roar, Nearer, drearer, more and more,— The famisht wild beast's roar for bread! Suddenly the child's hand ceased Its sport among the tiny tresses Of the little golden head Backward bent to its caresses; All those tumbled curls released; While the pouting child-lips said ‘Mother, I am hungry!’ Cry Of the Poor man's child, supprest In a People's starving breast, For so many wicked years! Cry, no law could longer smother In the lawless lifeless past! By what strange revenge of chance Didst thou thus ascend so high, From what depths of woe upcast, As to smite the heart of a mother, Heard in the unwilling ears Of a listening Queen of France, From a Dauphin's lips at last?

To greet the young Atlantis of the West Strange gifts the Monarchs of the Old World sent: The sighings of the hearts of their opprest, Howlings and hungers of their hungriest, And many a trampled truth, and foil'd intent, And pining hope erewhile in prison pent, Half-starving bodies and sore-stricken souls, And every wretchedness the deep unrest That shakes the sad shores of the Old World rolls Ever and anon to drown in gulfs unguest, —The wreeks of Time! And all these ruin'd things The Witch-Queen of the Oceanides Shaped into glorious forms of crownèd kings; And to their sorrows gave she sovereignties Upon the frontiers of the Future Time; Where they sit throned, judging the Old World's crime. 2. Yet did the Old World plague her on this wise: Into the cradle of her childhood's sleep It dropt a serpent's egg. And, ere her eyes Were open'd, forth did the hatch'd reptile creep, And breed a venomous brood of tyrannies, Sloths, usurpations, ignominies, lies: Which her yet-infant force, by fear, did keep Subservient to their wicked witcheries. These, when she stronger wax'd, and strove to rise And set her foot upon the viperous heap Of their infernal progeny, were wise In the old wisdom of their Serpent Sire, And, taught by Satan, tempted her desire Of Power—to palter and to compromise With Profit—by their poison-pouches brew'd From human blood in human flesh black-hued So that the Angel in her droopt his wing, And sank into a sick and sullen swound; And Gold was made her God, and Cain her King, And Crime the crown wherewith her head was crown'd. Until her reptile rulers wax'd secure Of Sin's success, and pass'd the bitter bound Of what God's patience suffers man to' endure; Spat on the cheek their kiss had left impure, Beat her, and left her bare to her distress. But, hardier than the hooted lioness When the net breaks,—stern mother of strong times, She leapt to lordly life, and roll'd around The lustrous orbs of her indignant scorn, And rent her coward compact with the crimes Of the Old World; which, deeming her forlorn In that surpassing pang wherein she found Surpassing strength, glad of man's loss stood by, With spleenful sneer, and supercilious eye, Scribbling on time's loose sands with crooked staff Anticipations of her epitaph. For, fool'd by its own wishful hate, it deem'd Those pangs of her transcendent Second-Birth To be the desperate death-throes of what seem'd Her last wild hour. And the old kings o' the earth Mock'd with their pointed sceptres, and made mirth. 3. Then, in the dark of her shaked star's eclipse, She caught and clung to that Omnipotent Hand Which whoso holds stands fast, nor ever slips Or strays, tho' darkness be on sea and land. And Strength was given to her from Heaven, when Power Proffer'd by Hell she spurn'd: strength to withstand And stand. In that apocalyptic hour Her might was inexhaustible by man, (Even as the mythic horn, which ever flow'd, Because the illimitable ocean Forever at one end thereof abode) For thro' her frame those heavenly forces ran Whose fountain-head is the Eternal God. Her fervid foot with fiery purpose shod (Forged by strong Faith) the formidable field Of frenzied Opposition firmly trod; Tho' oft repulsed, returning oft, to yield Of Freedom's heritage no hallow'd sod: Nor ever drowsed she on her battle shield, Till her supreme spear, red with traitorous blood, Had slain the Serpent and his rebel brood. 4. A Queen she is, tho' round her forehead shines No semblance of the circlet of a crown; Save what rare promise of rich sunrise twines In her wild hair from splendours of its own. High in the heaven of human hope her throne Rises remote from us, whose orb declines Down the dark slope of time,—remote and lone In solitary light, as when afar A crimson cloud, the pent sun's stormy zone, Brightens the welkin; and belated signs Are setting, and a sudden breeze is blown About the shuddering stillness of the dawn: Some sleep a heavy sleep, with curtain drawn And shutter fast against whatever beams Visit the dark; and unto them dawn's star Is even as tho' it were not: some there are That see and fear it; unto whom it seems A portent prophesying woeful war, And ruin to the world whereon it gleams, The falling of long-fixèd faiths, the jar Of jostled thrones, the flowing forth of streams Whose fury Law's old limitary bar Shall stem no more, the unsoldering of old schemes, And foundering of old fabrics, splint and spar, And trampling of tumultuary extremes Which man's mild golden middle way shall mar: But some, tho' few, that dream'd of it in dreams And waked, believing, with unwearied eyes To watch for the illumining of dark skies, What time the skies were darkest, hail the sight As haply herald of a long-wisht light. 5. Little she heeds our welcome or our scorn. The title-deeds of her immense command She sues not from the signing of our hand. Great Nature sign'd them when her child was born. Great Nature guards them. They shall not be torn From Nature's grasp. The inviolable land Into whose spacious lap her affluent horn Showers more wealth than e'er the unvalued sweat Of serf and villain did of old beget From the wrong'd earth, to appease the discontent Of murtherous monarchies whose names are yet On palaces and temples opulent, She holds by Nature's, not by our, consent. Her foot is on the Serpent she hath slain. The wound is in her bosom, where he bit. The red blood blossoms, as it drips from it, To flowers that flourish best on battle plain; Which, being pluckt, for sudden cures are fit; Whose biting juices purge out many a stain. Her cheek is flusht with fervour, not with pain. Her eyes are beacon lights by Freedom lit. And her strong forehead is severely knit By somewhat of a newly-learn'd disdain For the much mockery of our little wit. About the fillet of her brows is writ Humanity—sad word, oft sigh'd in vain By weary lips of wretches doom'd to sit Counting the links of Custom's cruel chain: But on those lips of hers the sound thereof Is even as tho' all laughters that had lain, (Frozen by old Unwisdom's wintry scoff) Long mute in Nature's mighty heart, leapt free To join a new world's general jubilee. 6. We, clinging to the present, in our fear To front the future, miss the joy of both. We praise the past, with praises insincere, For what its loudest eulogists are loth To emulate; whose supercilious sloth Plays off, with hollow commendations drear, The virtues and the valours that have ceased To shape the conduct of mankind's career Against whatever lives in living breast Of virtue and of valour, striving here, And striving now, to help man's imminent need, And honour passèd worth by present deed. We chuckle when they fall, who fight—or sink, Who soar—or stumble, who strain forward still. We know not what to do, nor what to think, Save only to do nothing, and think ill Of all things done. We peep about the brink Of the full-flowing river of time, until Some waning moon's wan influence, to fulfil Our feeble hope, do chance to suck and shrink The torrent wave we have not strength nor skill Either to pass, or turn what way we will. The winds of change afflict us. What to-day We tether tight to-morrow whirls away. That which our faith affirms our fear denies. Our conscience cries to our convenience Nay. The tides of things are flowing otherwise Than with their wills on whom our doubt relies. Their prophesyings Fate's fierce facts gainsay, And Time's swift wisdom their slow wit belies, Whose master is unmerciful surprise, And their sad task, impossible delay. 7. Therefore the ardours and the heats, that here No flames enkindle from our altars cold, The hopes which our inhospitable fear Hoots into houseless space,—the manifold Enthusiasms, Love sends forth to cheer Each lusty champion that gives battle bold In his glad cause,—the meanings and the aims That move the mighty disc of Circumstance, And that strong demiurgic faith, that frames Foundations deeper than the drifts of chance, Escape us—in the striving of the soul Of poets, and the thinking of the thought Of sages, and the yearning to its goal Of that endeavouring Impulse, which hath brought All things to what they are, nor pauses ever Halfway to what they shall be; whose endeavour Undoes our deedless doings. And all these Are made the servants of the Destinies Which, being our despots, are her ministers; Who dips in the dim light of setting suns The spacious skirts of that vast robe of hers That widens ever in the wondrous West: But on her sceptre shines the morning star, Whereto she sings mysterious orisons. In her large lap Jove's Bird hath built his nest; And the great Ocean Stream orbicular Goeth about to girdle her strong breast, Whereto the nurseling hopes of Time are prest. 8. A mightier wrong than the remorseless Greek, In the sad decad of the woes of Troy, Revenged what time he did his angers wreak On grey-hair'd Priam and his Phrygian boy, A loftier scorn than that of Thetis' son, With nobler sword, redress'd on fiercer field: A fairer prize than Helen's beauty won; A haughtier foe than Hector forced to yield; And left a theme, for larger Iliads fit Than Homer sung, in legends yet unwrit. 9. Then came the Old World's monarchs; who had sought (Hoping that Hell might over Heaven prevail) To crown the infernal foe wherewith she fought, What time the fight was dubious,—crying, ‘All hail ‘Most sovereign lady! since thou didst not fail In battle such as never was before, Since when the Titans did the Gods assail. For now thou art the Goddess we adore, (Long vow'd to lift not whatsoever veil Her Godhood wears) whose title is Success. Therefore be witness of our willingness To give thee welcome!’ But she answer'd not: Who then was musing on man's faith in what Her faith had won for man—Futurity. That war was not as theirs, earth's anarchs old, Mere barbarous battle for most brutal gain, The slave's affliction and the tyrant's joy, The making, not the breaking, of the chain Which Hell's Ambition in his hand doth hold: —But, for all human faith in human worth; For man's most outraged hope in heavenly things; For those high aspirations that go forth, The holy souls of human sufferings, To gladden God; for our afflicted Earth And our forgotten Heaven; for whatsoe'er Redeems the Past, making the Future fair, The Present blameless; for the black man's flesh, The white man's spirit; for Freedom, fluttering, Caught in her first flight by the fowler's mesh, With sullied feather and with broken wing; For all sublime Ideas that cry to God, Buried alive beneath earth's clumsy clod Of sullen fact; and every noble thought; —For these, not only for herself, she fought! And theirs her victory is, not hers alone: For they to help her in the conflict wrought. Where'er the oppressor trembles at the groan Of the opprest; wherever Truth is taught To challenge Falsehood with undaunted tone; Wherever a slave is made into a man, And that man's flesh and blood are made his own; Where what a poet dreams a people can Resolve to achieve; wherever what hath been A wish—scarce even a hope—in ages gone, Begins to be a certainty clear-seen; Wherever Justice widens Freedom's span; Wherever right for all is wrong to none, And fear in many is not force in one; Wherever life assumes a lovelier mien; Wherever Conscience is crown'd Custom's Queen; Wherever good believed is good begun; —The everlasting trophies she hath won Shall stand unshaken by the storms of time, Deep as man's heart, and as man's hope sublime. MISERY. I. 'T was neither day nor night, but both together Mix'd in a muddy smudge of London weather, And the dull pouring of perpetual Dim rain was vague, and vast, and over all. She stray'd on thro' the rain, and thro' the mud, That did the slop-fed filmy city flood, Meekly unmindful as are wretches, who, Accustom'd to discomfortings, pursue Their paths scarce conscious of the more or less Of misery mingled with each day's distress. Albeit the ghostly rag, too thin to call Even the bodily remnant of a shawl, (Mere heaps of holes to one another stitch'd) That tightly was about her shoulders twitch'd, As, at each step, the fretful cough, in vain By its vext victim check'd, broke loose again, And shiver'd thro' it, dripping drop by drop, Contrived the flaccid petticoat to sop With the chill surcharge of its oozy welt. The mud was everywhere. It seem'd to melt Out of the grimy houses, trickling down Those brick-work blocks that at each other frown, Unsociable, tho' squeezed and jamm'd so close Together; all monotonously morose, And claiming each, behind his iron rail, The smug importance of a private jail. It seem'd to stuff the blurr'd and spongy sky; To clog the slimy streets; and fiercely try To climb the doorsteps; blind with spatter'd filth The dismal lamps; and spew out its sick spilth At unawares, from hidingplaces, known In dark street-corners to its spite alone. She stray'd on thro' the mud: 'twas nothing new: And thro' the rain—the rain? it was mud too! The woman still was young, and Nature meant, Doubtless, she should be fair; but that intent Hunger, in haste, had marr'd, or toil, or both. There was no colour in the quiet mouth, Nor fulness; yet it had a ghostly grace Pathetically pale. The thin young face Was interpenetrated tenderly With soft significance. The warm brown eye, And warm brown hair, had gentle gleams. Perchance Those gracious tricks of gesture and of glance, Those dear and innocent arts,—a woman's ways Of wearing pretty looks, and winning praise, —The pleasantness of pleasing, and the skill, Were native to this woman,—woman still, Tho' woman wither'd. There's a last degree Of misery that is sexless wholly. She Was yet what ye are, mothers, sisters, wives, That are so sweet and lovely in our lives;— A woman still, for all her wither'd look, Even as a faded flower in a book Is still a flower. II. Dark darker grows. The lamps Of London, flaring thro' the foggy damps, Glare up and down the grey streets ghostily, And the long roaring of loud wheels rolls by. The huge hump-shoulder'd bridge is reach'd. She stops. The shadowy stream beneath it slides and drops With sulky sound between the arches old. She eye'd it from the parapet. The cold Clung to her, creeping up the creepy stream. The enormous city, like a madman's dream, Full of strange hummings and unnatural glare, Beat on her brain. Some Tempter whisper'd ‘There, ‘Is quiet, and an end of long distress. Leap down! leap in! One anguish more or less In this tense tangle of tormented souls God keeps no strict account of. The stream rolls Forever and forever. Death is swift, And easy.’ Then soft shadows seem'd to lift Long arms out of the streaming dark below, Wooingly waving to her. But ah no, Ah no! She is still afraid of them to-night, Those plausible familiars! Die? What right Is hers to die?—a mother, and a wife, Whose love hath given hostages to life! The voices of the shadows make reply ‘Woman, no right to live is right to die. What right to live,—which means, what right to eat (What thou hast ceased to earn) the bread and meat That's not enough for all,—what unearn'd right Hast thou to say “I choose to live?”’ With might The mocking shadows mounted, as they spoke, Nearer, and clearer; and their voices broke Into a groan that mingled with the roar Of London, growing louder evermore With multitudes of moanings from below, Mysterious, wrathful, miserable. ‘Ah no, ‘Ah no! For Willie waits for me at home, And will not sleep all night till I am come. 'Tis late . . . but there were hopes of work to do: I waited . . . tho' in vain. Ah, if he knew! And how to meet to-morrow?’ . . . A drunken man Stumbled against her, stared, and then began To troll a tavern stave, with husky voice, (The subject coarse, the language strong, not choice) And humming reel'd away. Up stream'd again The voices of the shadows, in disdain: ‘A mother? and a wife? Ill-gotten names, Filch'd from earth's blisses to increase its shames! What right have breadless mothers to give birth To breadless babies? Children, meant for mirth, And motherhood for rapture, and the bliss Of wifehood crowning womanhood, the kiss Of lips, whose kissing melts two lives in one:— What right was thine, forsooth, because the sun Is sweet in June, and blood beats high in youth, To claim those blessings? Claim'd, what right, forsooth, To change them into curses: craving love, Who lackest bread? There is no room above Earth's breast for amorous paupers. Creep below. And hide thyself from failure!’ ‘Is it so?’ She murmur'd, ‘even so! and yet . . . dear heart, ‘I meant to comfort thee!’ Then, with a start, ‘And he is sick, poor man! No work to-day . . . No work to-morrow . . . And the rent to pay . . . And two small mouths to feed!’ . . . Three tiny elves As plump as Puck, at all things and themselves Laughing, ran by her in the rain. They were Chubby, and rosy-cheek'd, with golden hair, Tossing behind: two girls, a boy: they held Each other's hands, and so contrived to weld Their gladnesses in one. No rain, tho' chill, Could vex their joyous ignorance of ill. Then, sorrowfully, her thoughts began to stray Far out of London, many a mile away Among the meadows: In green Hertfordshire When lanes are white with May, the breathing briar Wafts sweet thoughts to our spirits, if we pass Between the hedges, and the happy grass, Beneath, is sprinkled with the o'erblown leaves Of wild white roses. In the long long eves The cuckoo calls from every glimmering bower And lone dim-lighted glade. The small church tower Smiles kindly at the village underneath. Ah God! once more to smell the rose's breath Among those cottage gardens! There's a field Past the hill-farm, hard by the little weald, Was first to fill with cowslips every year; The children used to play there. Could one hear Once more that merry brook that leaves the leas Quiet at eve, but thro' the low birch trees Is ever noisy! Then, at nutting time The woods are gayer than even in their prime, And afterwards, there's something, hard to tell, Full of home-feelings in the healthy smell Wide over all the red plough'd uplands spread From burning weeds, what time the woods are dead. ‘We were so young! we loved each other so! Ah yet, . . . if one could live the winter thro’! And winter's worst is o'er in March . . . who knows? The times might mend.’ Then thro' her thoughts uprose The menacing image of the imminent need Of this bleak night. ‘Two little mouths to feed! ‘No work! . . . and Willie sick! . . . and how to pay To-morrow's rent?’. . . She pluck'd herself away From the bewildering river; and again Stray'd onwards, onwards, thro' the endless rain Among the endless streets, with weary gait, And dreary heart, trailing disconsolate A draggled skirt with feeble feet slip-shod. The sky seem'd one vast blackness without God, Or, if a god, a god like some that here Be gods of earth, who, missing love, choose fear For henchman, and so rule a multitude They have subdued, but never understood. The roaring of the wheels began anew. And London down its dismal vortex drew This wandering minim of the misery Of millions. III. Grey and grisly 'neath this sky Of bitter darkness, gleam'd the long blind wall Of that grim institute, we English call The Poor-House. We build houses for our poor, Pay poor-rates,—do our best, indeed, to cure Their general sickness by all special ways, If not successful, still deserving praise, Because implying (which, for my part, I Applaud intensely) that society Is answerable, as a whole, to man, —Ay, and to Christ, since self-styled Christian! For how the poor, it brings to birth, may fare; Tho' some French folks count this in chief the' affair Of Government, which pays for its mistakes To Revolution, when grim Hunger breaks His social fetter sometimes. Still, remains This fact, a sad one:—'spite of all our pains, The poor increase among us faster still Than means to feed them, tho' we tax the till To cram the alms-box. Which is passing strange, Seeing that this England in the world's wide range Ranks wealthiest of the nations of the earth. But thereby hangs a riddle which is worth The solving some day, if we can. That's all. This woman, passing by that Poor-House wall, Shudder'd, and thought . . . no matter! 'twas a thought Only that made her shudder,—till she caught Her foot against a heap of something strange, And wet, and soft; which made that shudder change To one of physical terror. 'Twas as tho' The multitudinous mud, to scare her so, Had heap'd itself into a hideous heap, Not human sure, but living. With a creep The thing, whate'er it was, her chance foot spurn'd, Began to move; like humid earth upturn'd By a snouted mole, disturb'd; or else,—suppose A swarm of feeding flies, when cluster'd close About a lump of carrion, or a hive Of brown-back'd bees. It seem'd to be alive After this fashion. A collective mass Of movement, making from the life it has, Or seems to have, in common, tho' so small, A sort of monstrous individual. For, from the inward to the outward moved, The hideous lump heaved slowly; slowly shoved Layer after layer of soak'd and rotting rags On each side, down it, to the sloppy flags Beneath its headless bulk; thus making space For the upthrusting of the creature's face, Or creature's self, whate'er that might have been. Whence, suddenly emerging,—to be seen, One must imagine, rather than to see, Since it look'd nowhere, neither seem'd to be Surprised, or even conscious,—there was thrust (As tho' it came up thus because it must, And not because it would) a human head, With sexless countenance, that neither said To man, nor woman . . . ‘I belong to you,’ But seem'd a fearful mixture of the two United in a failure horrible Of features, meant for human you might tell By just so much as their lean wolfishness Contrived more intense meaning to express Than hunger-heated eye or snarling jaw Of any real wolf. Stricken with awe, The woman, only very poor indeed, Recoil'd before that creature past all need, And past all help, too, being past all hope. For, stern and stark, against the stolid cope Of the sad, rainy, and enormous night, That sexless face had fix'd itself upright At once, and, as it were, mechanically, With no surprise; as much as to imply That it had done with this world everywhere, And henceforth look'd to Heaven; yet look'd not there With any sort of hope, or thankfulness For things expected, but in grim distress, From the mere wont of gazing constantly On darkness. London's Life went roaring by, And took no notice of this thing at all. It seem'd a heap of mud against the wall. And if it were a vagrant . . . well? why, there The Poor-House stands. The thing is its affair, Not yours, nor mine; who pay the rates when due, And trust in God, as all good Christians do. And yet,—if you or I had pass'd that way, And noticed (which we did not do, I say. Not ours the fault!) the creature crouching there, I swear to you, O Brother, and declare For my part, on my conscience, that, altho' I never yet was so opprest, I know, By instant awe of any king or queen, Prelate, or prince, whate'er the chance hath been, As to have felt my heart's calm beating stopp'd, Or my knees faulter, yet I must have dropp'd (Ay, and you too, friend whom my heart knows well!) In presence of that unapproachable Appalling Majesty of Misery; Lifting its pale-faced protest to the sky Silently against you, and me, no doubt, And all the others of this social rout That calls itself fine names in modern books. IV. The woman, stone-cold 'neath the stony looks Of this rag-robed Medusa, shrank away Abasht; not daring, at the first, to say Such words as, meant for comfort, might have been Too much like insult to that grim-faced Queen, Or King, whiche'er it was, of Wretchedness. Her own much misery seem'd so much less Than this, flung down before her,—by God sent, It may have been, for her admonishment. But, at the last, she timidly drew near And whisper'd faintly in the creature's ear ‘Have you no home?’ No look even made reply, Much less a word. But on the stolid sky The stolid face stared ever. ‘Are you cold?’ A sort of inward creepy movement roll'd The rustled rags. And still the stolid face Perused the stolid sky. Perhaps the case Supposed was too self-evident to claim More confirmation than what creeping came To crumble those chill rags; subsiding soon, As tho' to be unnoticed were a boon, All kinds of notice having proved unkind. Such creatures as men hunt are loth to find The hole discovered where they hide; and, when By chance you stir them out of it, they then Make haste to feign to be already dead, Hoping escape that way. The woman said More faintly ‘Are you hungry?’ There, at once Finding intensest utterance for the nonce, With such a howl 'twould chill your blood to hear The wolf-jaws wail'd out ‘Hungry? ha, look here!’ And, therewith, fingers of a skeleton claw Tearing asunder those foul rags, you saw . . . . Was it a woman's breast? It might be so. It look'd like nothing human that I know. She, whose faint question such shrill response woke, Stood stupified, stunn'd, sick. V. Just then there broke Down the dim street (and any sound just then, Shaped from the natural utterance of men, To still that echoed howl, had brought relief To her sick senses) a loud shout . . . ‘Stop thief! Stop thief!’ A man rush'd by those women,—rush'd So vehemently by them, that he brush'd Their raggedness together,—as he pass'd, Dropp'd something on the pavement,—and was fast Wrapp'd in the rainy vapours of the night, That, in a moment, smear'd him out of sight, And, in a moment after, let emerge The trampling crowd; which, all in haste to urge Its honest chase, swept o'er those women twain, Regardless, and rush'd on into the rain, Leaving them both, upon the slippery flags, Bruised, trampled,—rags in colloquy with rags, And so,—alone. VI. Meanwhile the wolfish face, Resettled to its customary place, Was staring as before, into the sky, Stolid. The other woman heavily Gather'd herself together, bruised, in pain, Half rose up, slipp'd on something, and again Sank feebly back upon her hand. But now What new emotion shakes her? Doth she know What this is, that her fingers on the stone Have felt, and, feeling, close so fiercely on? This pocketbook? with gold enough within To feed . . . . Alas! and must it be a sin To keep it? Were it possible to pay With what its very robber flings away For bread . . . bread!. . . bread!. . . and still not starve, yet still Be honest! ‘Were one doing very ill If . . . One should pray . . . if one could pray, that's sure, The strength would come at last. We are so poor! So poor . . . 'tis terrible! To understand Such things, one should be learn'd, and have at hand Ever so many good religious books, And texts, and things. And then one starves. It looks So like a godsend. What does the Book say About “the lions, roaring, seek their prey”? And the young ravens? “Ye are more than these.” Ah, but one starves, tho'!' Crouch'd upon her knees She dragg'd herself up close against the wall, And counted the gold pieces. ‘Food for all? ‘Us four? And that makes five. The rent to pay To-morrow? Father, give me strength, to pray Thy will be done!. . . What, if it were His will That one should keep it, . . . since one finds it? Still Have bread to eat? . . . till one can work, of course. Why else should God have sent it? Which is worse To starve, or . . . 'Tis as long as it is broad. And then, consider this, I pray, dear God! Two little mouths already, and no bread. And my poor man this three days sick in bed. And no more needlework, it seems, for me Till times turn round. Who knows when that will be? Ah, . . . and consider yet again. That's four To feed already. Then a fifth? One more! However can we eke it out? Ah me, God's creatures to be left like this! Just see How thin she is!’ Her hands about the thing They clutch'd began to twitch. Still fingering The gold convulsively, again she thought, Or tried to think, of lessons early taught, Easy to learn once, in the village school, When to be honest seem'd the simple rule For being happy; and of many a text That task'd old Sundays; growing more perplext, As, more and more, her giddy memory made Haphazard catches at the words. ‘Who said “Therefore I say unto you” (ah! 'twere sweet) “Have no thought for your lives, what ye shall eat” (If that were possible!)—“nor what to wear”? Have no thought? that should mean, then, have no care! “Your Father knoweth of what things ye need Before ye ask”. . .“The morrow shall take heed For its own things”. . .? And still, 'tis sure He bade The people pray “Give us our daily bread.” And elsewhere. . . “Ask, and ye shall have”. . . ‘And yet One starves, I say. ‘Ay! They that have shall get. That's somewhere, too, and nearer fact, no doubt. If the rich knew what the poor go without Sometimes! They do their best for us, that's sure. But still, the poor. . . they are so very poor! “Whoever giveth to the least of these Giveth to Me” . . .? Why one can give with ease What is one's own . . . when anything's one's own! Ha! whose is this? There is no owner known. God sent it here. Whose is it now?’ She stopp'd, And trembled. And the tempting treasure dropp'd From her faint hand. She snatch'd it up again, And cried ‘Mine! mine! be it the Devil's gain Or God's good gift! Sure, what folks must, folks may, And folks must live.’ She gazed out every way Along the gloomy street. In desert land To tempted saints mankind was more at hand Than now it seem'd to this poor spirit pent In populous city. VII. Hurriedly, she bent Above her grim companion, in whose ear She mutter'd, hoarse and quick. . .‘Make haste! see here. ‘There's bread enough for all of us. Get up! Quick! quick! and come away. To-night we'll sup, To-morrow we'll not starve ... another day, Another . . . and then, let come what come may! Off! off!’ No answer. To the stolid sky The stolid face was turn'd immovably. The sky was dark: the face was dark. The face And sky were silent both: you could not trace The faintest gleam of light in the dark look Of either. Vehemently the woman shook That miserable mass of rags. It let Itself be shaken: did not strive to get Up, or away: said nought. A worried rat So lets itself be shaken by a cat Or mastiff, when the vermin's back, 'tis clear, Is snapp'd, and there's no more to feel, or fear. ‘O haste!’ No answer. ‘It is late. . .late! come!’ No answer. Those lean jaws were lock'd and dumb. Then o'er the living woman's face there spread Death's hue reflected. ‘Late!. . .too late!’ she said. ‘O Heaven, to die thus!’ With a broken wail She turn'd, and fled fast, fast. Fled whither? VIII. Pale Thro' the thick vagueness of the vaporous night, From the dark alley, with a clouded light Two rheumy, melancholy lampions flare. They are the eyes of the Police. In there, Down the dark archway, thro' the greasy door, Passionately pushing past the three or four Complacent constables that cluster'd round A costermonger, in the gutter found Incapably, but combatively, drunk, The woman hurried. Thro' the doorway slunk A peaky pinch'd-up child with frighten'd face, Important witness in some murder case About to come before the magistrate To-morrow. At a dingy table sat The slim Inspector, spectacled, severe, Rapidly writing. In a sort of fear Of seeing it again, she shut her eyes And flung it down there. With sedate surprise The man look'd up. ‘Because I do not know The owner, sir’. . . she said. ‘A while ago I found it. And there's money in it . . . much, Oh, so much money, sir!’ A hungry touch Of the defeated Tempter made her wince To see him count it. Such a short while since She, too, had done the same. ‘Your name? address?’ She gave them. Easy, from the last to guess Their wretchedness who dwelt in such a place! The shrewd and practised eye perused her face Contented, not surprised; for they that see Crime oftenest, oftenest, too, see honesty Where most of us would seldom look for it, Or find it with surprise . . . in rags, to wit. ‘Honest and poor. Deserves a large reward. No doubt there'll be one.’ ‘Ah, the times are hard, So hard, God help us all! and, sir, indeed We are so poor. Two little mouths to feed. If one could only get some work to do!’ ‘Ah . . . married? out of work? and children? two? Mem. Let the owner know, if found. Good night.’ But still she stood there. He had turn'd to write. She stood, and eyed him with a dreary eye, And did not move. He look'd up presently. ‘Not gone, yet? eh? what more?’ ‘And, sir’ . . . she said, ‘There's by the Work-House wall a woman. . .dead. There was no room within, sir, I suppose. There are so many of them. Heaven knows 'Tis hard for such as we to understand How such things happen in a Christian land.’ Her face twitch'd, and her cough grew fierce again, As she pass'd out into the night and rain. MELANCHOLIA. AFTER ALBERT DÜRER. I. Not in lone wastes, nor by the desert sea, But aye in sound of ceaseless human moan, By populous shores where wealthy cities be, The deep-eyed Melancholy dwells alone: Her elbow large is based on her broad knee; An iron-claspèd volume hath she thrown Athwart her hollow ample lap; but she Doth neither read, nor even look, therein; Whose eyes with innermost intensity Burn outward; her shut hand props her upslanted chin. II. Her vesture vast, of watchet hue, the mould Of her strong limbs from lap to foot doth heap In many a massive fall, and rigid fold; And all unmov'd the mighty hem doth sleep Flat on the chilly floor. Her hair down roll'd, With unregarded curl, doth thinly creep O'er her stoop'd shoulder. Heavy from the hold Of her firm girdle hang full many keys: For she to Power is porteress, and doth keep The lock'd and guarded gates of mightiest monarchies. III. Crownèd she is with the first-budded leaves Of Spring, that putteth forth delightful things; But her knit brow beneath her garland grieves: Folded about her back with eagle wings Half spread for flight; but her strong body cleaves Unto the toilful earth. The wealth of kings Is at her feet, but of her eye receives No notice: it is hers: she heeds it not. Her labour lieth around her; measurings, Plans, shapes, globe, solid, plank, adze, plane, and melting-pot. IV. Her foot is on the hammer and the saw: Her hand is on the compass; and she waits. Who knoweth what mighty circle she will draw? What calculation vast she meditates? A lean wolf-hound, hard-by, with doubled paw, Snores on the flint; her creature tired, that sates, (Stretching at her firm foot his shaggy jaw) In slumber deep, deep animal weariness. But never his great Spirit-Queen abates Her intellectual watch, and strenuous sleeplessness. V. Because this Melancholy is, indeed, The mightiest maker underneath the sun. Yet never shall be satisfied the need Of her deep heart, nor her long tasks be done. Sorrow and strength are hers: and she doth feed With infinite labour infinite longing. None That know her ever shall from toil be freed. Rest is not hers to give: but in her hand Dominion hangs, and sorrows, that have won Great battles, harness'd wait upon her stern command. VI. And some, beholding her with woeful eyes, Have said, “This is Our Lady of Desire That, feeding earth, doth hunger for the skies, Full-fatal is her kiss, and fraught with fire. Know her not.” Others, “Nay, but she is wise, Strong, patient, and of toil doth never tire. Sad is she, certes; but her inmost sighs Are the strong souls of deeds. She is her own Employer, and doth nothing serve for hire. Therefore this Melancholy is most worthy to be known.” VII. Above, a hollow bell doth hang i' the beam; Therefrom a rope. O'er one of her large wings Upon the shadowy wall a sullen scheme Is faintly traced of careful numberings. Near which, above the other wing, doth gleam A livid hourglass that, unmark'd down flings His measured sands in small monotonous stream. Death creeps, and peeps into her deep Endeavour; Time, mocking, saith “Thou makest glorious things For my unmaking.” She, not answering, museth ever. VIII. And on an old millstone that leans hard by The head of the unmindful Melancholy, With little wings, the Cherub Infancy Sits conning her great lesson, meek and lowly; Across whose small upgather'd knees doth lie An open tablet that is cover'd wholly With his first lore. There hangeth from on high A brazen balance. Slowly stealeth down The night wherein can no man work, and slowly The seas and skies grow dark about the distant town. IX. There, heavily, across the troubled night A warning comet trails her hideous hair, And underneath, the wroth sea waves are white. The city soundeth, girt with dreadful glare. The cataract cloud spouts storm. With faintest light, Athwart the seething dark suspended fair, A wan moon-rainbow wavers on the height. A thing of darkness and of shapelessness Half-bat, half-serpent, flitteth outward, there; Much like the sadness struggling under stress Of a strong purpose vex'd, not baffled, by despair. X. This is a mystery. And methinks 'twere worth Much thought to know what things it would express. Dürer, the drawer of dread things, drew forth The image of it, and the marvellousness, Out of the angry labour of the North, Whose child he was: to be (if I can guess Aright) man's protest against death, and dust, Sad time, sick sloth, and wretched-heartedness, And shame, and miserable self-mistrust, And wicked fears that do full oft men's souls distress. LAST WORDS OF A SENSITIVE SECOND-RATE POET. Will, are you sitting and watching there yet? And I know, by a certain skill That grows out of utter wakefulness, the night must be far spent, Will: For, lying awake so many a night, I have learn'd at last to catch From the crowing cock, and the clanging clock, and the sound of the beating watch, A misty sense of the measureless march of Time, as he passes here, Leaving my life behind him; and I know that the dawn is near. But you have been watching three nights, Will, and you look'd so wan to-night, I thought, as I saw you sitting there, in the sad monotonous light Of the moody night-lamp near you, that I could not choose but close My lids as fast, and lie as still, as tho' I lay in a doze: For, I thought, “He will deem I am dreaming, and then he may steal away, And sleep a little: and this will be well.” And truly, I dream'd, as I lay Wide awake, but all as quiet, as tho', the last office done, They had streak'd me out for the grave, Will, to which they will bear me anon. Dream'd; for old things and places came dancing about my brain, Like ghosts that dance in an empty house: and my thoughts went slipping again By green back-ways forgotten to a stiller circle of time, Where violets, faded for ever, seem'd blowing as once in their prime: And I fancied that you and I, Will, were boys again as of old, At dawn on the hill-top together, at eve in the field by the fold; Till the thought of this was growing too wildly sweet to be borne, And I oped mine eyes, and turn'd me round, and there, in the light forlorn, I find you sitting beside me. But the dawn is at hand, I know. Sleep a little. I shall not die to-night. You may leave me. Go. Eh! is it time for the drink? must you mix it? it does me no good. But thanks, old friend, true friend! I would live for your sake, if I could. Ay, there are some good things in life, that fall not away with the rest. And, of all best things upon earth, I hold that a faithful friend is the best. For woman, Will, is a thorny flower: it breaks, and we bleed and smart: The blossom falls at the fairest, and the thorn runs into the heart. And woman's love is a bitter fruit; and, however he bite it, or sip, There's many a man has lived to curse the taste of that fruit on his lip. But never was any man yet, as I ween, be he whosoever he may, That has known what a true friend is, Will, and wish'd that knowledge away. You were proud of my promise, faithful despite of my fall, Sad when the world seem'd over-sweet, sweet when the world turn'd gall: When I cloak'd myself in the pride of praise from what God grieved to see, You saw thro' the glittering lie of it all, and silently mourn'd for me: When the world took back what the world had given, and scorn with praise change'd place, I, from my sackcloth and ashes, look'd up, and saw hope glow on your face: Therefore, fair weather be yours, Will, whether it shines or pours, And, if I can slip from out of my grave, my spirit will visit yours. O woman-eyes that have smiled and smiled, O woman-lips that have kist The life-blood out of my heart, why thus for ever do you persist, Pressing out of the dark all round, to bewilder my dying hours With your ghostly sorceries brew'd from the breath of your poison-flowers? Still, tho' the idol be broken, I see at their ancient revels, The riven altar around, come dancing the selfsame devils. Lente currite, lente currite, noctis equi! Linger a little, O Time, and let me be saved ere I die! How many a night 'neath her window have I walk'd in the wind and rain, Only to look at her shadow fleet over the lighted pane! Alas! 'twas the shadow that rested, 'twas herself that fleeted, you see, And now I am dying, I know it:—dying, and where is she? Dancing divinely, perchance, or, over her soft harp strings, Using the past to give pathos to the little new song that she sings. Bitter? I dare not be bitter in the few last hours left to live. Needing so much forgiveness, God grant me at least to forgive. There can be no space for the ghost of her face down in the narrow room, And the mole is blind, and the worm is mute, and there must be rest in the tomb. And just one failure more or less to a life that seems to be (Whilst I lie looking upon it, as a bird on the broken tree She hovers about, ere making wing for a land of lovelier growth, Brighter blossom, and purer air, somewhere far off in the south,) Failure, crowning failure, failure from end to end, Just one more or less, what matter, to the many no grief can mend? Not to know vice is virtue, not fate, however men rave: And, next to this I hold that man to be but a coward and slave Who bears the plague-spot about him, and, knowing it, shrinks or fears To brand it out, tho' the burning knife should hiss in his heart's hot tears. But I have caught the contagion of a world that I never loved, Pleased myself with approval of those that I never approved, Palter'd with pleasures that pleased not, and fame where no fame could be, And how shall I look, do you think, Will, when the angles are looking on me? Yet oh! the confident spirit once mine, to dare and to do! Take the world into my hand, and shape it, and make it anew: Gather all men in my purpose, men in their darkness and dearth, Men in their meanness and misery, made of the dust of the earth, Mould them afresh, and make out of them Man, with his spirit sublime, Man, the great heir of Eternity, dragging the conquests of Time! Therefore I mingled among them, deeming the poet should hold All natures saved in his own, as the world in the ark was of old; All natures saved in his own to be types of a nobler race, When the old world passeth away, and the new world taketh his place. Triple fool in my folly! purblind and impotent worm, Thinking to move the world, who could not myself stand firm! Cheat of a worn-out trick, as one that on shipboard roves Wherever the wind may blow, still deeming the continent moves. Blowing the frothy bubble of life's brittle purpose away; Child, ever chasing the morrow, who now cannot ransom a day: Still I call'd Fame to lead onward, forgetting she follows behind Those who know whither they walk thro' the praise or dispraise of mankind. Friend, lay your hand in my own, and swear to me, when you have seen My body borne out from the door, ere the grass on my grave shall be green, You will burn every book I have written. And so perish, one and all, Each trace of the struggle that fail'd with the life that I cannot recall. Dust and ashes, earth's dross, which the mattock may give to the mole! Something, secure of achievement survives, as I trust, with the soul. Something? . . . Ay, something comes back to me . . . Think! that I might have been . . . what? Almost, I fancy at times, what I meant to have been, and am not. Where was the fault? Was it strength fell short! And yet (I can speak of it now) How my spirit sung like the resonant nerve of a warrior's battle bow When the shaft has leapt from the string, what time, her first bright banner unfurl'd, Song aim'd her arrowy purpose in me sharp at the heart of the world! Was it the hand that falter'd, unskill'd? or was it the eye that deceived? However I reason it out, there remains a failure time has not retrieved. I said I would live in all lives that beat, and love in all loves that be: I would crown me lord of all passions (and the passions were lord of me!) I would compass every circle, I would enter at every door, In the starry spiral of science, and the labyrinth of lore. Arrogant error! whereby I starved like the fool in the fable of old, Whom the gods destroyed by the gift he craved, turning all things to gold. A little knowledge will turn youth grey. And I stood, chill in the sun, Naming you each of the roses; blest by the beauty of none. My song had an after-savour of the salt of many tears, Or it burn'd with a bitter foretaste of the end as it now appears: And the world, that had paused to listen awhile, because the first notes were gay, Pass'd on its way with a sneer in a smile: “Has he nothing fresher to say? “This poet's mind was a weedy flower that presently comes to nought!” For the world was not so sad but what my song was sadder, it thought. Comfort me not. For if aught be worse than failure from over-stress Of a life's prime purpose, it is to sit down content with a little success. Talk not of genius baffled. Genius is master of man. Genius does what it must, and Talent does what it can. Blot out my name, that the spirits of Shakspeare and Milton and Burns Look not down on the praises of fools with a pity my soul yet spurns. And yet, had I only the trick of an aptitude shrewd of its kind, I should have lived longer, I think, more merry of heart and of mind. Surely I knew (who better?) the innermost secret of each Bird, and beast, and flower. Failed I to give to them speech? All the pale spirits of storm, that sail down streams of the wind, Thro' the cloven thunder-cloud, with wild hair blowing behind; All the soft seraphs that float in the light of the crimson eve, When Hesper begins to glitter, and the heavy woodland to heave: All the white nymphs of the water that dwell mid the lilies alone: And the buskin'd maids for the love of whom the hoary oak trees groan; They came to my call in the forest; they crept to my feet from the river: They softly look'd out of the sky when I sung, and their wings beat with breathless endeavour The blocks of the broken thunder piling their stormy lattices, Over the moaning mountain walls, and over the sobbing seas. So many more reproachful faces around my bed! Voices moaning about me: “Ah! couldst thou not heed what we said?” Peace to the past! it skills not now: these thoughts that vex it in vain Are but the dust of a broken purpose blowing about the brain Which presently will be tenantless, when the wanton worms carouse, And the mole builds over my bones his little windowless house. It is growing darker and stranger, Will, and colder—dark and cold, Dark and cold! Is the lamp gone out? Give me thy hand to hold. No: 'tis life's brief candle burning down. Tears? tears, Will! Why, This which we call dying is only ceasing to die. The hard thing was to live, Will. With flowers and music, life, Like a pagan sacrifice, leads us along to this dark High Priest with the knife. I have been too peevish at mere mischance. For whether we build it, friend, Of brick or jasper, life's large base dwindles into this point at the end, A kind of nothing! Who knows whether 'tis fittest to weep or laugh At those thin curtains the spider spins o'er each dusty epitaph? Wherefore, if man be immortal (which faith in the days that are done I have ever upheld 'neath the weight of that Present, which now is this Gone) Should he fear lest his feeble unfolding from this cramp and chrysalis world Of forces sheathed in himself, by the strongest not wholly unfurl'd, This first of man's efforts at growth, howsoever it fail or succeed, Be the last of his dealings with time, and the spirit stop short with the deed? Do you know, I have often thought, Will, that, we feverish spirits are, here In life, shut down, like wingèd moths enclosed in a crystal sphere, Thro' whose thin glassy element we can see upon all sides round The starry spaces, the heavens, the heights, the depths, the immense, the profound; Which seen, the soul no sooner soars to attain what her passion perceives, Than bruised by her limits, with frustrate wing, she falls to the earth. Death cleaves With a kindly touch, as he passes by, this globe, this brittle thing That clips us round, and at last we are free. But ah woe, if the wounded wing Of the broken spirit can bear no more the beating heart above! For me there will soon be scope to soar: but this sorrowful weight of love I shall hardly uplift from the earthy bed to which it is sinking me. Pray for my soul, in her trial, at hand, of the wonderful world to be! Pray for my soul, that she may find and fashion some fairer way From the manifold modes of expression as yet unfound, unattempted, to say The word within, which that handful of earth the hard sexton will shovel anon On the lips of a buried man can surely not check, when its meaning is gone To work on the world that death opens. I wait. There are ages in store. But the love . . . ah, the love, Will? the fair human face that I follow'd of yore, It eludes me at last, and for ever! for ever I lose it! the most I can gain from the grave, is—not this, but the knowledge of why it was lost. A BEATEN ARMY. 1 We have struck our last blow, we have spent our last shot now, And we pour here in protest the last drops of life. All—save man's honest right—we have lost, they have got now, And theirs is the triumph where ours was the strife. 2 Ours, the blood on the bastion: our foeman's, the flag there: His, the soil of our birth: ours, the graves he insults: And our brave dead are dumb while their murderers brag there Of crimes praised on earth for successful results. 3 Be it so! tho' Right Trampled be counted for Wrong, And that pass for Right which is Evil Victorious, Here, where Virtue is feeble, and Villany strong, 'Tis a Cause, not the fate of a Cause, that is glorious. 4 Here, where heroes are vanquisht, where robbers are victors, Where the Wronger the Judge is,—from Cæsar to God Scorn'd Justice, preceded no more by her lictors, Appeals for escape from the axe and the rod. 5 Be it so! We are saved thus from man's obligations, For man's mere success, to the means which deduct From pure Truth just so much as is owed to relations With Chance, for what Chance gives—this world's usufruct. 6 Earth's Success, at the purest, with stain of the earthy Leaves the white worth of Truth, where it touches it, less: But what worth has Success in the cause that's unworthy? We have fail'd? Be it so! We are pure of Success. 7 And so man puts upon us no claim, to diminish Our claim upon God—which is perfected thus: Here our least gain begins where their greatest must finish: They—the debtors to Earth for what Heaven owes to us! 8 Graves are better than crowns thus. Oh, ever and ever This bartering Eternity's birthright to Time! God, we give Thee, unblemisht, our frustrate endeavour: Earth, we leave thee, unchallenged, thy share in man's crime! A POOR MAN OR THE MATCHMAKER AND THE BIRD. (BEING AN ALLEGORY.) I knew a man, the world call'd poor Because he barely paid the price Of leave to live. I pass'd his door, I think, once daily, twice or thrice. A little door in the long street, Left open to let in the sun Which, warmly its old friend to greet, Into the house did laughing run. For there was that in this man's face Which made you feel the sun was bound To come and shine on any place Where such a face was to be found. He barely earn'd the bread of life By making little wooden matches: He shaped them neatly with a knife And tied them up in tiny batches: The labour of his life was this. Perhaps, if I could feel quite sure Mine were as innocent as his, I should not mourn to be as poor. Because, whene'er I chanced to meet That man's face, I perceived it smiled A smile as innocent, and sweet, And simple, as a little child, Smiling at all things. I suppose His soul was in its infancy, Life's smiling-time, which most men lose By living. Else, I wonder why I felt so sure he smiled thus too, When neither I, nor any one, Was there to see him. Think! how few There are, that smile when quite alone! And from a cage upon the wall A bird sang to him all day long, So sweet and merry a madrigal That all who, passing, heard that song Felt younger, therefore better; just As tho' the times were back again, Which man's growth buries in the dust It drops from its own branches, when We yet could hear, from the blue sky, In accents clearly understood, Our Father saying to us ‘Try, My children, to be glad and good.’ So I felt: so felt all that heard: Till, pleased, the neighbours each began To pray ‘God bless the singing bird, ‘That sings to bless the working man!’ For in the work of the man's hand, As in the song of the bird's heart, There was, we all could understand, A unison. Each seem'd a part O' the other: and, still, both, as 't were, Of something higher,—since both praised it. The joy of labour, not the care: ‘The Poetry of Life,’ some phrased it. The world (whatever that word means, That means so little, or so much, According as our humour leans) Holds rich, or poor, whom good things, such As fetch the world's good price, belong Or lack to. What's the value which God sets on Labour and on Song? This poor man had them. Was he rich? The old watchmaker (still his shop Stands yonder, where the town buys watches) Used daily, passing here, to stop And greet my poor friend of the matches. And, day by day, that rich man offer'd To buy this poor man's bird away. Ten gulden . . . twelve . . . fifteen . . . he proffer'd: And still the poor man answer'd Nay. Ten gulden? twelve? fifteen? a fortune Undream'd of by a man so poor! And still that rich man, to importune This poor man, daily seeks his door: And, day by day, the silver pieces Before the poor man's eyes are spread And, day by day, the sum increases: And still the poor man shakes his head. I watch'd this bargain, day by day. We poets, in dark corners peeping ‘For subjects’, as you people say, Have cat's eyes that when closed, and sleeping As you might think, are most awake. I, with this friendly fellow-creature, Had bargains of my own to make; My business being with Human Nature; Whose ins and outs if we would turn to, We men of verse must not be nice. And I would have you people learn, too, For what we learn we pay the price. All these things happen'd, you may know, In old Vienna, famed ('tis said there) As now it is, in years ago, For wooden matches which are made there. Next time he came, the mechanician Here, in his crafty hand, did bring (The wary, wicked, old magician!) An instrument, a marvellous thing! And, quoth the wealthy man of watches ‘Good morrow, friend! and, good friend, pray How many dozen wooden matches Do you suppose you make a-day?’ ‘Some twenty dozen. Sometimes more, It may be.’ ‘Twenty dozen, say you? And, good friend, for each dozen score How much may your employers pay you?’ ‘For every dozen kreutzers five.’ ‘The paltry fellows! Only that? A beggarman, as I'm alive, Gets more by holding out his hat.’ Therewith, triumphant, up he takes A block of wood that's lying by, Sets to it his instrument, and makes Some twenty hundred matches fly All neatly shaved across the table. ‘Magic! why here, in half a second, Are matches more than I am able To make in twenty days well reckon'd,’ The poor man shouts in wonderment. ‘Just so, friend. Here your fortune see. Keep you the cunning instrument, And give the singing bird to me.’ Amazed, subdued, bewilder'd, lost, The poor man render'd up the song, The labour, of his life. Almost I hoped that rich man, for the wrong He did this poor man, might be stricken In time by some avenging twinge; And something in me seem'd to sicken, As when a sudden sallow tinge, For all the flaring of the sun, Shows the first sign of sure decay In Summer's glorious green begun. For when I heard my poor friend say ‘'Tis magic! devilcraft!’ I thought He had good cause for saying this, And that the Devil might have bought God's gift away—that smile of his. But now he flourish'd and grew rich, Gain'd money, spent it, throve in trade, Retired, and lived at ease. All which Was cause for smiling—so folks said. And yet they say he smiled no more (And I believe the thing they say) That smile he used to smile of yore, When he was poor, and work'd all day. How should he smile so? when the song, The labour, of his life were gone? Said I, just now, that all day long He used to smile, when quite alone? Error! Who less alone than he With work and song, then? It was now The man was quite alone, you see. And now he smiled no more, I know: Because this difference rests between Man's work—which Nature cheers meanwhile, And the mere work of a machine:— One smiles, the other hath no smile. So still about my mind will lurk The question . . . There's some value, sure, God's Will assigns to Song and Work: This rich man lack'd them. Was he poor? A MAN OF SCIENCE OR THE BOTANIST'S GRAVE. “Here lie the mortal remains” (I may spare you the limitless list Of academies, institutes, colleges, orders, whereof he was member) Of Doctor Theophilus Timothy Bloom, the renown'd botanist, Deceased (so his gravestone instructs you) the fourteenth day of December, In the Year of Our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty=two.” See! the lichens, already revenging themselves on their former tormentor, Sprawl over his new-cut name, and have hidden it half out of view. Meanwhile, I that knew the man, mourning my mild-eyed Mentor, Graced in his dust by this epitaph lean and bald as himself, Whom I fancy I still see spreading his specimens dry in the sun He has taken his final farewell of, bequeathing, at least, to my shelf Full forty folios in print, and a manuscript newly begun On the carbonaceous compounds found in botanical tissues,— Cellulose, glucose, lignine, dextrine, inuline, starch,— A treatise laboriously written, and raising remarkable issues On all questions of cellular structure, commenced but a year back in March,— For the honour and glory of Science, as well as my old friend's sake, I, that knew him, I say, here relate you his life from beginning to end. —Hark! how the throstle is singing! and yonder bluebells in the brake, How they nod on the noontide airs! . . . Peace be to the soul of my friend! Man's life dwindles apace, while the world grows vaster and vaster, And Nature, pleasing herself, smiles heedless of simple or sage. Be it known, then, that Doctor Theophilus Timothy Bloom, our master, Who has left us forlorn of his lights in the sixtieth year of his age, He, too (who could imagine it?), under that lean leathern hide of his Once bore about the high-beating and bountiful heart of a boy, A heart full of wonder and worship! Was passionate, too, in the pride of his New-born belief in himself as a being capacious for joy. Bright you may image the eye of him (long since dull as a paste eye), Bright with a brilliant hope in a July morning sweet, When the boy's blithe step thro' the college cloister bounded hasty, And, proud, at the door of the Teacher the passionate boy's heart beat. “Speak, my Pupil!” “O Master, I burn with a boundless impatience to know.” “For this must I praise thee, my Pupil. For knowledge is joy to the creature Created to know the Creator. Yet patience! since knowledge is slow, Being infinite. What wouldst thou know?” And the boy, unabash'd, answer'd, “Nature.” “Nature is vaster than knowledge. What wouldst thou know of her, my son?” “Not, O Master, the act, which I see, but the thought, which I cannot discern: I stand in the centre, gaze round me, see everywhere action alone, And find nowhere the source of the thought found in action wherever I turn.” Said the Teacher, “In order, my Pupil, to reach to the source of the thought, We must follow the act in succession. The thought may be one, once for all, All at once; but the action is many and diverse, to unity brought In the mind by slow aggregates growing alike from the great and the small. “There is but one vast universal dynamic, one mover, one might, Variously operant under the various conditions it finds: And we call that by turns electricity, friction, caloric, and light, Which is none of these things, and yet all of them. Ask of the waves and the winds, “Ask of the stars of the firmament, ask of the flowers of the field, They will answer you all of them, naming it each by a different name. For the meaning of Nature is neither wholly conceal'd nor reveal'd, But her mind is seen to be single in her acts that are no-where the same. “Each of these acts is a spy and informer upon her: and any Of the separate sciences, following these, may be follow'd by man: For the goal of man's mind is one, but the goings of men's minds many, And each, by his own way going, must get to the goal as he can. “By the hundred ways that await you are waiting a hundred guides: Yet you can but walk one way at a time, follow one guide, use One chart, in despite of the ninety-nine others each comer decides At the outset to take or renounce, as his choice may predominate. Choose!” Heavy, then, hearing this, was the heart of the student, whose soul But a moment before on her wing was uplifting the world's light load, And, “How can I choose me, O Master, the road, since I see not the goal? Or how can I choose me the guide, since I see not even the road?” The Master, smiling, answer'd . . . “Of the works of Nature, those Wherein her method of working is easiest found of detection, Are certain living bodies whose life can but feebly oppose The life-seeking, life-slaying process of scientific dissection: “These bodies are vegetal bodies: the dealing of Science with these Is the least of her difficult labours. Begin, then, with Botany . . . Stay! Open the door before you, and turn to the right, if you please. You are in the Botanical Class, now. Stay here, friend. I wish you good day.” So sitteth Theophilus perch'd on the brim of the beaker of knowledge, Poor fly! sipping . . . Nature? no, Botany,—merely one kind of ingredient Of the complex Elixir he thirsts for:—the blue-eyed hope of the College, A maiden-minded student, humble of heart and obedient. But O what a hopeless confusion doth Order at first sight appear! Unwearied Theophilus, sitting, and conning the grammar of Nature, Thro' the whole of the humming hot noon with the cuckoo's note cleaving it clear, Is it knowledge thou seekest? Then patience, and master, meanwhile, nomenclature. So, like a drunken bee, you behold him, bewilder'd, floundering, Foot-deep, faint in the pollen; or, now, climbing filaments, high on The polypetalous whorl; now, wandering round and around a ring Rotate, campanulate, ventricose, valvate . . . O wheel of Ixion! Day after day, and still darkness. At length a light breaks on the labour. For Linnæus, the Lecturer tells us, has classified plants, single-handed. “Classification of plants?” . . . All hail! bid the pipe and the tabor Be joyful! the chaos grows cosmic: at length on firm ground we are landed! No! . . . For this classification, the learnèd Professor continues, Is utterly wrong; since it separates plants into sexes, like men; Whereas plants are not plagued, like us humans, in that way. So brace up your sinews, Push on, and good-by to Linnæus. The light's out. All darkness again. Not that, just yet, it much matters: no cause, at the least, for dejection. Here's a new house, where the first thing is simply to stow away lumber; Make yourself room to look round you; in time, after further reflection, Doubtless you'll hit on some better arrangement; and, once disencumber The ground that you stand upon, presently things will drop into their places, Each his appropriate corner find out, and most fitting relation: So, till the fates find a fitter one, let us, not making long faces, But thankful enough to Linnæus, put up with his classification. New light anon! Hope of haven descried from a different shore, now! Where Science, in France, clearer-sighted, escaped from all tangle and trammel, eyes The whole of the vegetal world in neat groups, and has fix'd evermore now This fact,—that, tho' plants have no sexes, they nevertheless may have families. Still, tho', the infinite found in the finite dismays our endeavour. To the unknown perforce we abandon this vast starry sphere (sad confession!) As baffling our bounded embrace: but it surely is hard when for ever The least grain of sand we approach, growing reachless, eludes our possession. Worlds beyond worlds without end, we may make up our minds to relinquish: But worlds within worlds without end make the heart of a man faint within him; To be mock'd by a mite! and to feel that the lamp of our life must extinguish Its light, ere, exploring, we measure immensity pack'd in a minim! To be crusht by a crystal of salt! to be foil'd by a film, or a flinder! To be stopp'd like the merest, minutest of emmets, whose poor little progress To the goal, where she drops underground, the least hump of a molehill may hinder! A fortress to find in each fungus! in each lady Fly-trap an ogress! “One group, but one, from the million learn first to know something about, now,” Says the Lecturer, leaving the pulpit, his brain for a while pump'd powerless, “I propose to begin with the most elementary class, and give out now As the theme of our next day's discourse, the class call'd Cryptogamic, or Flowerless.” Deep, then, we plunge into Acrogens, Ætheogams, Amphigams, still: Hope to get on by degrees into Exogens, Endogens: meantime Moons wax and wane; summers fleet; from the Student, as patient he crams still Dry leaves under tin lids, steals sighing the glad and the green time. Sad! For I fancy . . . at times, as the moist eye wanes ever meeker, And the lank yellow locks by degrees fall scant from the pure bald brow, Much-tried Theophilus (still a sad-thoughted unsatisfied seeker) Startled, perchance, by the cuckoo, or vext by green buds on the bough, Lifting those wide wan looks, with an unslaked grief in the gaze of them, Into the high blue stillness of heaven, so still, and so high! Watching the white clouds roll'd on the unreturning ways of them, Murmuring among his books, with a deep dejected sigh, “Ah, but all this, after all, is not what I pined for! Up there The veilèd Mystery sits on the solemn mountain peak: The vast clouds form and change at her feet: and my heart's despair Cries aloud where no auswer is heard: for this Silence never will speak. “Yonder, up there, as of old, when he play'd on my heart's harp-strings, The wind, with a surly music, is moaning aloof in the tree: Yonder, up there, in the blue and the breezy mid-sky swings The lanneret hawk, as of old, when my heart went higher than he. “Could one leap all at once to the end! not doom'd, like a grub, to grope About in the blinding earth, looking up never more from one's load! Well, never mind! One is laying up knowledge, at least, one must hope; And one cannot afford to leap over the knowledge that lies in one's road.” Intermediate methods! importance of every detail! Say we, consoling ourselves; and again pick up heart to persist. Ha, but cryptogams grow by the hundred, and books by the bushel,—men fail! Here the door opens. In steps the Botanical Archivist, Asking...whom else but Theophilus? what better man could you wish? To catalogue all the collection of dried plants recently sent From the Himmalayan range by Commander Cornelius Fish; And Theophilus cannot decline an appeal where an honour is meant. Friend! when a man to one purpose the whole of his will hath awarded, He will justly be jealous of all other claims on the time given to it: He will lock up his life in a turret of tall triple brass, dragon-guarded, Hide himself close in a strong central thought, and let nothing break thro' it: Beauty peeps in at the casement, he savagely fastens the shutter: Pleasure trips light at the threshold, he pushes the bolt in the door: Fortune, red gold in her right hand, comes fearless with good news to utter, He seals up his ears like Ulysses, and laughs at her, proud to be poor: But one foe, the most unforeseen, the most dangerous, deadliest of all, Sure, if it finds, to o'erthrow him—the child of a word or a glance, The tenant of emptiest nothing—he cannot exclude, nor forestal, Nor contend with, how wary so ever: and that foe is lnnocent Chance. Theophilus, most coscientious, most scrupulous scraper-together Of crumbs dropt from other men's trenchers, laboriously much-annotating, Sorting, reviewing, arranging,—assigning its true whence and whither To this plant, and that plant, of each plant the family history stating, In the hap-hazard, higgledy-piggledy ship-load of riches from Nature Robb'd by Commander Cornelius Fish, the illustrious sailor, Lights, by ill luck, on a milk-white gnaphalium, foreign in feature,— Petals more pointed and definite, sepals profuser and paler Than those of its kindred in Europe,—in short, a new specimen, clearly Distinguish'd. Whereat, as in conscience compell'd, for mankind's information The Doctor (alas! now no longer mere student, but straighten'd severely Into sedate middle age) then and there, after due consultation Of all that botanical writers have said on gnaphalia in general, Sits down, and indites a small treatise, this specimen specially treating;— Its structure, morphology, system, and elements, gaseous or mineral, Thus in respect of the race of gnaphalia, our knowledge completing. Which done now, ... no sooner the Doctor's small treatise, exciting sensation, Is read by the learnèd, than straightway three scandalised savants, dissenting In toto, determined to deal with what calls for severe reprobation, Hurl at him and the public three passionate pamphlets, objecting, commenting, Suggesting, appealing, opposing, inveighing, reproaching, regretting; Whereunto, nothing daunted, he feels himself bound to make answer minutely, Disclosing, expounding, disputing, affirming, denying, upsetting, Proving himself no mere tyro, attacking the main points acutely. Back to the charge, each opponent, tenacious returning, with rage hacks Hard at the Doctor, and fights every inch with the heart of a Roman: Not to be vanquish'd by numbers, the Doctor, as valiant as Ajax, Buckles the tighter his breastplate, and rushes in wrath on the foeman. Religion, meanwhile, and Theology fly to the rescue of something, No man precisely knows what, with emphatical protest on all things. O what a strepitant contest, to make a man envy the dumb thing Gifted by God with the grace to be silent, whatever men call things! Ossas of argument piled upon Pelions of perfect conviction! Otium rogat ... no help for it! Caught now, mid-seas, in Ægeo, On we drive, hurl'd by Euroclydon ... Heaven send us help in affliction, And save us from heretic knaves, qui non recte loquuntur de Deo! Deathless, the dismal discussion continues thro' years grey and greyer. Curst be the hand of Commander Cornelius Fish! that did gather That mischievous milk-white mountain weed, better left on its layer Of snow, near the sunrise, safe hid in the high Himmalayan weather. Wretchedest weed in creation! sly hypocrite fashion'd by Fate, To bring the grey hairs of my friend full of grief to the grave where he lies now! Who could surmise in thy face of white innocence heartfuls of hate And contention? No more upon thee, wicked weed, will I ever set eyes now! For the learnèd defunct we lament here at last grew (and all for thy sake too!) Nothing more than, himself, a mere human gnaphalium, sapless and wither'd; Till Death, for his own choice collection of dried things, was minded to take to Himself such a notable specimen. Bloom, with the bloom off him, gather'd By Dis, gloomy gatherer! catalogued, pack'd up, disposed of for ever, Lies (here you have him!) named, dated, and done with. Meanwhile the great question He started, surviving the Doctor, who died of his latest endeavour, Continues to puzzle our Pundits with cart-loads of precious suggestion. Suppose, now, some man with one object in life—to construct a steam-engine:— First, say you, study dynamics; then metals; learn smelting and founding; Off with you, next, to the cog-wheel department; cog wheels; you may then join The cylinder-makers; and so forth; in this way the full circle rounding; Meanwhile the man dies. Our friend here,—what now is he doing, I wonder? Chasing a phantom gnaphalium, worlds beyond worlds wanly straying? Or simply, with palms cross'd at ease on his cool narrow couch, lying under This pother, and laughing alone in his grave-sleeve at what I am saying? Anyhow, here lie the mortal remains (with a limitless list too Of academies, institutes, colleges, orders, whereof he was member) Of Doctor Theophilus Timothy Bloom the renown'd botanist, who Died in the year Sixty-two, on the fourteenth day of December. Well! sitting here on the grave of my master, while under the stone The red worm is picking his brains, there's a notion comes into my mind:— (Was it the throstle that sung it, up there where the blackthorn is blown? Or here, in the long grass, was it let fall by the whispering wind? What, if the grey cricket chirrup'd it, chasing yon seed-ball enchanted? What, if the wild bee humm'd it, ruffling the rich guelder rose?) The world, perchance after all, knows already enough: what is wanted Is, not to know more, but know how to imagine the much that it knows. A GREAT MAN. 1 That man is great, and he alone, Who serves a greatness not his own, For neither praise nor pelf: Content to know, and be unknown: Whole in himself. 2 Strong is that man, he only strong, To whose well-order'd will belong, For service and delight, All powers that, in the face of Wrong, Establish Right. 3 And free he is, and only he, Who, from his tyrant passions free, By Fortune undismay'd, Hath power upon himself, to be By himself obey'd. 4 If such a man there be, where'er Beneath the sun and moon he fare, He cannot fare amiss. Great Nature hath him in her care Her cause is his: 5 Who holds by everlasting law Which neither chance nor change can flaw: Whose steadfast course is one With whatsoever forces draw The ages on: 6 Who hath not bow'd his honest head To base Occasion: nor, in dread Of Duty, shunn'd her eye: Nor truckled to loud times: nor wed His heart to a lie: 7 Nor fear'd to follow, in the offence Of false opinion, his own sense Of justice unsubdued: Nor shrunk from any consequence Of doing good. 8 He looks his Angel in the face Without a blush: nor heeds disgrace, Whom nought disgraceful done Disgraces. Who knows nothing base Fears nothing known. 9 Not morsell'd out from day to day In feverish wishes, nor the prey Of hours that have no plan, His life is whole, to give away To God and man. 10 For tho' he live aloof from ken, The world's unwitness'd denizen, The love within him stirs Abroad, and with the hearts of men His own confers: 11 The judge upon the justice-seat: The brown-back'd beggar in the street: The spinner in the sun: The reapers reaping in the wheat: The wan-cheek'd nun 12 In cloister cold: the prisoner lean In lightless den: the robèd Queen: Even the youth who waits, Hiding the knife, to glide unseen Between the gates:— 13 He nothing human alien deems Unto himself, nor disesteems Man's meanest claim upon him: And, where he walks, the mere sunbeams Drop blessings on him: 14 Because they know him Nature's friend, On whom she doth delight to tend With loving-kindness ever, Helping and heartening to the end His high endeavour. 15 Therefore, tho' mortal made, he can Work miracles. The uncommon man Leaves nothing commonplace. He is the marvellous. To span The abyss of space, 16 The orb of time, is his by faith, And his, whilst breathing human breath, To taste, before he dies, The deep eventual calm of death, Life's latest prize. 17 If such a man there be, where'er Beneath the sun and moon he fare, He doth not fare alone. He goeth girt with cohorts, powers, The monarch of his manful hours, Whose mind's his throne: 18 He owes no homage to the sun: There's nothing he need seek or shun: All things are his by right: He is his own posterity: His future in himself doth lie: His soul's his light: 19 Lord of a lofty life is he, Loftily living, tho' he be Of lowly birth: tho' poor, He lacks not wealth: nor high degree In state obscure. 20 The merely great are, all in all, No more than what the merely small Esteem them. Man's opinion Neither conferr'd, nor can recall, This man's dominion. MABEL MAY. 1. I was weary all thro' of the thousand and one Wants, wishes, and wretchedest sorts of strife Within, and without, which some call Life, Mable May, When I climb'd to the cloud on the mountain cone, And lay on the bare black rock, alone, In the watchful twilight vast and grey, Mabel May; And yearn'd for the yet unarisen light, As a wretch yearns, sick of a woeful night; —To plunge, in a passionate gush of sight, And leap at one bound of a rapture bright, Into the burning heart of the sun, And be lost,—like a star, when the dark is done, O'erwhelm'd in the fount of the full-pour'd day, Mabel May! 2. And lo you! all round me, all o'er me, he rose, The august godlike Glory pure, Which not even the eagle's eyes endure, Mabel May: He smote, like a trumpet, the slumbering snows To a burning blush, from their pale repose Wide awake; and ... How shall I say, Mabel May? My very heart ached with the interminate Splendour for which it had lain in wait. Was it joy, was it pain, was it love, was it hate, That agony born of a bliss too great? And I stagger'd blinded beneath the blows Of the bare-orb'd Beauty, and sought for who knows What phantom hand to lead me away, Mabel May! 3 So it ever hath been, so it ever shall be, Since man was made for the lot of man. 'Tis the curse of his course since his course began, Mabel May. Our soul to feel, and our sight to see, Are afire and athirst. Then it comes: and we Are made sport for the powers we brought into play, Mabel May. We desire: we are strong: we are proud of the pain: Scale the summit: and, breathless, behold—but in vain— What we cannot endure. We are lost by our gain, And o'erwhelm'd by the triumph whereto we attain: Enslaved by the force we ourselves have set free, And unmade by the might that we make. Who is he That stands fast, and looks full in the face of his day, Mabel May? 4. So I turn'd me anon by the downward track To the valley beneath; never lifting again My looks left dim by the dazzling pain, Mabel May; With above and behind me the mountain, black And broad, still holding the sun at his back; And dejectedly follow'd my darkling way, Mabel May, With no care now what the chance might be Of the next thing I should be forced to see, When the dance of the colours that, dazzling me Danced on before, should disperse and flee, And leave me asmart from the torturous hack Of the Sun-god's triumphing knife, alack! Like that poor Satyr, he stoop'd to flay, Mabel May. 5. But how did it happen? For suddenly there The vale was wash'd with a warm sweet wave Of luminous verdure balmy and suave, Mabel May; And a million mild wild odours were Afloat in the fresh moist morning air; And the birds broke out in a rapturous lay, Mabel May; While on each grass blade, in a silver bell, The bright dew trembled before it fell To the warbling pure, in the sweetbriar dell, Of that delicate harper, Ariel; And even the rock, no longer bare, Was robed in a roseate mantle rare; And the gaunt thorn-bushes were laughing gay, Mabel May. 6. Fools fly in the face of the bliss they believe They were born for. If born for it, why not wait? Can fate miss man, or man miss fate, Mabel May? No! we claim to acquire, unresign'd to receive, What chance, not choice, can alone achieve: And then, when we fail, as is fit, we say (Mabel May) ‘Better check desire than clasp despair!’ But what, when we say it, if unaware The burning Beauty we could not bear, Taking pity on our pain'd pride, as 'twere, Should pour itself over our path, and weave Life's way with the light we have learn'd to leave, Warming our souls with a reflex ray, Mabel May? 7. O'tis you are the cause of these thoughts, I try To release in song, but shall never succeed; They lie too deep in my soul, indeed, Mabel May! For in you is the light of my life; and I And my life are yours, to be made thereby Of what colour you will. You are my day, Mabel May! But that light of you in this life of mine Were a depth of glory too divine For my sense to bear, if it did not shine Soften'd, reflected,—fused, in fine, With the common things of life, that lie In that light, transmuted to melody, Odour, and colour, by its glad play, Mabel May. My wife, my life, my day, whose sway Makes all things sweet with a sense of sun, —Scent-breathing flowers, and birds' glad tone! My one in all, and my all in one, Now I hold you fast where my footsteps stray, And find you most when you seem away, Loving you more than my love can say, Mabel May! END OF BOOK IX.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Speed thee well, noble soul, gallant heart, Who unscared goest forth to the strife! Speed thee well, wheresoever thou art, In the ranks of the armies of life, Who dost battle for Good to the death, In that battle which never shall cease: And whose truth, long as falsehood hath breath, Will not parley with falsehood for peace! Who aloud, tho' unheard, criest No, When earth's clamorous Yes doth assent To the evil that's easy to do In a world that's with evil content. Yet restrain the exuberant sense Of the strength that is theirs who are strong In the Right: which, however immense, Is not yet more immense than the Wrong. For the battle, O soldier, is not To the strong, nor the race to the swift. For much given tho' little be got, Yet, O giver, be glad of thy gift. Though it be but a weed or a shell, That the labour of ages hath given Unto desert or ocean, to tell Of how deluge and earthquake have striven, Nature doth not despond: nor do thou From man's feverish effort hope more Than the labouring ages allow Nature's infinite patience to store. Look behind thee, and scan what is lost: And around thee, behold what doth rest. Lo, how little earth saves at the most Of the life of her bravest and best! Of what mighty endeavours begun What results insufficient remain, And of how many victories won Half the spoils have been taken again! For in scum this hot passion of life, Seething over, is spent: and so loses The possession of that which the strife Of its turbulent impulse diffuses: Until, self-defeated, it sinks Back again to a lowlier level, As, from bubbles that burst at the brinks, Fall the leas of each lingering evil. By evangel and angel from Heaven Unto Earth's many mourners below, Long of yore, the “Glad tidings” were given: But Earth's gladness, O where is it now? Long of yore, on the mountain, the voice Of the merciful Master was heard To the mourners proclaiming ‘Rejoice:’ And, rejoicing, they welcom'd his word: To the hand of the rich man ‘Restore,’ To the heart of the poor man ‘Be fed,’ And ‘Be heal'd,’ to the souls that were sore, And to all men ‘Be brothers,’ it said. But, since Christ hath been nail'd to the tree, Fruits unripe have our hands gather'd of it: Noisy worship of lip and of knee, Niggard love, not of love, but of profit. For the poor is opprest as of old: And of all men is no man the brother: And the Churches but gather their gold, While the nations destroy one another: Only, all of these things are now done In another than Cæsar's name: And all wrongs that are Christless go on Unashamed of all Christian shame: By the white man despised is the black: And the strong hath his heel on the weak: By the burthen still gall'd is the back: And the goal is yet distant to seek: Tho', to guide us, its shining is oft, Like a fire on the midnight, discern'd: When the hope of man's heart leaps aloft From the chain that his anguish hath spurn'd: As in Germany once: when a priest Was chang'd into a man, for man's sake; And his word, as the dawn fills the East, Fill'd the West, till a world was awake; In the letter a soul was created By the breaking the seals of a book; And man's conscience in man reinstated, All conscienceless sovereignties shook. Shook indeed, but not shatter'd! For straightway When indignant and bold in the breach Thought arose, and sped on thro' the gateway, Whence she beckon'd to all and to each, They that loosed her lost heart: and, as onward She explored her companionless track To the goal of her destiny—sunward, They wrung hands, and shriek'd to her ‘Come back!’ So she pass'd from among them forever, And hath left them where, still in the dark, Blowing watchfires spent, they shall never Blow the ashes thereof to a spark: Once in England: when Hampden's high will, Eliot's truth that was true to the death, Pym's large speech, and the sword that hath still ‘Freedom,’ graven by Law, on its sheath, Won for England what woe to the day When England forgets to revere, Or unheedfully casts it away, Thro' Futurity helmless to steer! Once in France: when the storm of the sound Of the spirits of men rushing free Shook the shores of the nations around, As the roar of a jubilant sea; And the heart of the feeble wax'd strong, For his friends were as one flesh and blood In the casting away of time's wrong And the gathering up of earth's good; But dull time goeth deafly since when Those rejoicings were mingled by time With the moans of the murders of men, And the cursings of carnage and crime; All is silent and sullen again: And again the old cankering forms Reappear, as when after the rain From the earth reappear the earth-worms. O the infinite effort that seems But in infinite failure to finish! Man's belief in the good that he dreams Must each fact, he awakes to, diminish? God forbid! Whom thank thou for whatever Of evil remains—understood As good cause for continued endeavour In the battle 'twixt Evil and Good. Heed not what may be gain'd or be lost In that battle. Whatever the odds, Fight it out, never counting the cost; Man's the deed is, the consequence God's. No man's labour for good is in vain, Tho' he win, not the crown but the cross. Every wish for man's good is a gain: Every doubt of man's gain is a loss. Not the price that we bargain to pay, But the price that she sets on herself, Is the value of Truth. Who can weigh What the weight of her worth is in pelf? To the soul, by whose lifelong endeavour Age hath won from the losses of youth, The mere loss of an untruth is ever Good as great as the gain of a truth. Men were fashion'd to love and to know: And in Knowledge and Love are the goals Of man's course, tho' its speed may be slow: In our patience possess we our souls. To love and to know ... winning love, Winning knowledge, by labour'd degrees From the doubts life compels us to prove, And the wants we are forced to appease. For man's privilege is to wring out From the knowledge of evil the zest That intensifies good: and from doubt The convictions time puts to the test. Old Experience—the bourne and the grave Of the Sluggard's self-sepulchred mind— Is the stronghold whence issues the Brave To acquire new realms for mankind. For had man's ever-widening will No domain but Experience, his sons Like his sires, would be savages still, Chewing acorns and worshipping stones. Deep in Nature's undrain'd Cornucopia Every good that man seeks he shall find: And to fools, only fools, is Utopia The abode of the hopes of mankind. For whate'er God hath made for man's good, He hath granted man means to attain: Say thou therefore ‘I will,’ not ‘I would,’ Undeterr'd by the coward's disdain. All unblest would our fate be, indeed, If yet all that can bless it were ended, And we had but to write and to read Of the deeds which the great buried men did! Did they plant? what they planted we grow. Every grain shall be ground into bread. Every virtue that's in us we owe To the unborn no less than the dead: For, ere born yet, Posterity breathes In our being: and shapes by its breath The incentives (worth more than the wreathes) Of the men that win wreathes after death. God be thank'd that the dead have left still Good undone, for the living to do— Still some aim for the heart and the will And the soul of a man to pursue! God be thank'd for the ills that endure, With the glory that's yet to be won From the hurts we may hope yet to cure By the deeds yet reserved to be done! And thank God for the foes that remain, If they hearten us, Friend, for the fight; And the mercy that grants to man's gain Yet a new gain forever in sight! Forth! Rejoice in the Good that God gives By the hand of beneficent Ill, And be glad that He leaves to our lives Means to make them heroical still. THE END.</field>
