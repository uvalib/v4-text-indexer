      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT WORTHILY HONORED, Robert Earle of Sommerset, &amp;c. AND HIS MOST NOBLE LADY the Ladie Frances. As nothing vnder heauen is more remou'd From Truth &amp; virtue, then Opinions prou'd By vulgar Voices: So is nought more true Nor soundly virtuous then things held by few: Whom Knowledge (entred by the sacred line, And gouernd euermore by grace diuine,) Keepes in the narrow path to spacious heauen, And therfore, should no knowing spirit be driuen From fact, nor purpose; for the spleens prophan Of humours errant, and Plebeian; But, Famelike, gather force as he goes forth, The Crowne of all Acts ends in onely worth. Nor will I feare to postrate this poore Rage Of forespoke Poesie, to your patronage, (Thrice worthy Earle), &amp; your vnequald grace (Most Noble Countesse) for the one-ear'd Race Of set-eyd vulgars, that will no waie see But that their stiffe necks driue them headlongy, Stung with the Gadflie of misgouernd zeale: Nor heare but one tale and that euer ill. These I contemne, as no Rubs fit for me To checke at, in my way t'Jntegritie. Nor will ye be incenst that such a Toie Should put on the presumption to enioie Your grauer eare, my Lord, and your faire eye (Illustrous Ladie) since poore Poesie Hath beene a Iewell in the richest eare Of all the Nuptiall States, that euer were. For as the Bodies pulse (in Phisique) is A little thing; yet therein th'Arteries Bewray their motion, and disclose, to Art The strength, or weakenesse, of the vitall part; Perpetually moouing, like a watch Put in our Bodies: So this three mens catch, This little Soules Pulse, Poesie, panting still Like to a dancing pease vpon a Quill, Made with a childes breath; vp and downe to fly (Is no more manly thought) And yet thereby Euen in the corps of all the world we can Discouer all the good and bad of man, Anatomise his nakednesse, and be To his chiefe Ornament, a Maiestie: Erect him past his human Period And heighten his transition into God. Thus Sun-like, did the learnd and most diuine Of all the golden world, make Poesie shine; That now, but like aglow worm, gleams by night Like Teachers, scarce fo?d, by their proper light. But this (my Lord) and all poore virtues else Expos'd, ah las, like perdu Sentinels Lo warne the world of what must needs be nie For pride, and auarice, glas'd by Sanctitie, Must be distinguisht, and decided by Your cleere, ingenuous, and most quiet eye Exempt from passionate, and duskie fumes, That blinde our Reason: and in which consumes The Soule, halfe choakt, with stomacke casting mists Spred in the purest, turnd mere humorists. And where with douelike sweet humility They all things should authorise or deny, The vulgar heate and pride of splene and blood Blaze their opinions, which cannot be good. For as the Bodies Shadow, neuer can Shew the distinct, and expact Forme of man; So nor the bodies passionate affects Can euer teach well what the Soule respects. For how can mortall things, immortall shew? Or that which false is, represent the trew? The peacefull mixture then that meetes in yow (Most t?perat Earl) that nought to rule doth ow: In which, as in a thorough kindled Fire, Light and Heat marrie Judgement and Desire Reason is still in quiet, and extends All things t'aduantage of your honored Ends, May well authorise all your Acts of Note, Since all Acts vicious, are of Passion got: “Through dead Calms, of our Perturbations euer “Truths Voice (to soules eares set) we heare or neuer “The meerely animate Man, doth nothing see “That tends to heauen: It must be onely He “That is mere soule: Her separable powers “The scepter giuing heere: That then discourse “Of Motions that in sence doe neuer fall, “Yet know them too, and can distinguish all “With such a freedome, that our earthly parts “Sincke all to earth: And then th'ingenuous arts “Doe their true office, Then true Policie “Windes like a serpent, through all Empery. “Her folds on both sides bounded, like a flood “With high-shores listed, making great and good “Whom she instructeth, to which, you (my Lord) May lay all claimes that Temper can afford; Nought gathering ere t'is ripe: and so must taste Kindely and sweetely, and the longer last, All fruits, in youth, ripe in you; and must so Imply a facultie to euer growe. And as the morning that is calme and gray, Deckt all with curld clowds, that the Sunne doth lay With varied coullours; All aloft exhall'd As they t'adorn euen heauen it selfe were call'd, And could not fall in slendrest deawes till Night, But keepe daies Beauty firme and exquisite; More for delight fit, and doth more adorne Eu? th'Eu? with Graces, then the youthful morn: So you (sweete Earle) stay youth in aged bounds Euen absolute now, in all lifes grauest grounds, Like Aire, fill euery corner of your place, Your grace, your virtue heightning: virtue, grace And keeping all clowds high, aire calme, &amp; cleer And in your selfe all that their height should rere Your life and light will proue a still full Moone, And all your night time nobler then your noone, The Sunne is in his rising, height, and set Still (in himselfe) alike, at all parts great, His light, heat, greatnes, coullors that are showne To vs, as his charge, meerely is our owne. So let your charge, my Lord, in others be, But in your selfe hold Sun-like constancie. For as men skild in Natures study, say, The world was not the world, nor did conuay To coupling bodies Natures common forme, But (all confus'd, like waues struck with a storme) Some small were, and (in no set being, staid) All comprehension, and connexion fled; The greater, and the more compact disturb'd With ceaseles warre, and by no order curb'd, Till earth receiuing her set magnitude Was fixt her selfe, and all her Birth indu'd With staie and law, so this small world of ours: Is but a Chaos of corporeall powers: Nor yeelds his mixt parts, forms that may becom A human Nature; But at randome rome Past brutish fashions, and so neuer can Be cald the ciuill bodie of a man; But in it, and against it selfe still fights, In competence of Cares, Ioyes, Appetites: The more great in command, made seruile more, Glutted, not satisfied: in plenty, poore: Till vp the Soule mounts, and the Scepter swaies Th'admired Fabricke of her world suruaies, And as it hath a magnitude confinde, To all the powers therein, she sees combinde In fit Acts for one end, which is t'obay Reason, her Regent; Nature giuing way: Peace, Concord, Order, Stay proclaim'd, and Law, And none commanding, if not all in Awe, Passion, and Anger, made to vnderlie, And heere concludes, mans morall Monarchie In which, your Lordships milde Soule sits so hie Yet cares so little to be seene, or heard, That in the good thereof, her scope is Sphear'd. The Theban Ruler, paralleling Right, Who, thirst of glory, turnd to appetite Of inward Goodnesse, was of speech so spare, To heare, and learne, so couetous, and yare, That (of his yeares) none, things so many knew: Nor in his speeches, ventured on so few: Forth then (my Lord) &amp; these things euer thirst Till Scandall pine, and Bane-fed enuie burst. And you, (most noble) Lady as in blood In minde be Noblest, make our factious brood Whose forked tongs, wold fain your honor sting Conuert their venomd points into their spring: Whose owne harts guilty, of faults faind in yours Wold fain be posting off: but, arme your powers With such a seige of vertues, that no vice Of all your Foes, Aduantage may entice To sally forth, and charge you with offence, But sterue within, for very conscience Of that Integritie, they see exprest In your cleere life: Of which, th'examples Rest, May be so blamelesse; that all past must be (Being Fount to th'other) most vndoubtedly Confest vntouch't; and Curiositie The beame picke rather from her own squint eie, Then ramp stil at the motes shade, faind in yours, Nought doth so shame this chimick serch of ours As when we prie long for assur'd huge prise, Our glasses broke, all vp in vapor flies. And as, the Royall Beast, whose image you Beare in your armes, and aires great Eagle too; Sill as they goe, are said to keepe in close Their seres, &amp; Tallons, lest their points shold lose Their vseful sharpnes, when they serue no vse: So this our sharp-eyd search that we abuse In others brests, we should keepe in, t'explore Our owne fowle bosomes, and quit them before VVe ransacke others: but (great Ladie) leaue These Rules to them they touch; do you receaue Those free ioies in your honour, and your Loue That you can say are yours; and euer moue Where your c?mand, as soon is seru'd as kown, Joyes plac't without you, neuer are your owne. Your Honours euer most humbly and faithfully vowd. Geo. Chapman. ANDROMEDA LIBERATA. The Argument. Andromeda, Daughter of Cepheus, King of Æthiopia; and Cassiope (a virgine exempted from c?parison in all the vertues &amp; beauties, both of minde and bodie) for the enuie of Iuno to her Mother; being compar'd with her for beauty and wisedome; (or as others write, maligned by the Nereides, for the eminent Graces of her selfe) moued so much the Deities displeasures; that they procur'd Neptune to send into the Region of Cepheus, a whale so monstrously vaste and dreadfull: that all the fields he spoild and wasted; all the noblest edifices tumbling to ruine; the strongest citties of the kingdome, not forcible enough to withstand his inuasions. Of which so vnsufferable a plague Cepheus consulting with an Oracle; and asking both the cause, and remedie; after accustomed sacrifices, the Oracle gaue answer, that the calamity would neuer cease, till his onely daughter Andromeda, was exposed to the Monster. Cepheus returnd, and with Iron chaines bound his daughter to a rocke, before a cittie of the kingdome called Ioppe. At which cittie, the same time, Perseus arriued with the head of Medusa &amp;c. who pittying so matchles a virgines exposure to so miserable an euent; dissolu'd her chaines and tooke her from the Rock. Both sitting together to expect the monster, &amp; he rauenously hasting to deuoure her, Perseus, turnd part of him into stone, &amp; through the rest made way with his sword to his vtter slaughter. When (holding it wreath enough for so renownd a victory) He took Andromeda to wife, &amp; had by her one daughter called Perse, another Erythræa, of whom, the sea in those parts is called Mare Erythræ?; since she both liued and died there: and one sonne called after himselfe, another Electrion, a third Sthenelus: and after liued Princely and happily with his wife and his owne Mother to his death. Then faind for their vertues to be made Constellations in Heauen. Away, vngodly Vulgars, far away, Flie ye prophane, that dare not view the day, Nor speake to men but shadowes, nor would heare Of any newes, but what seditious were, Hatefull and harmefull euer to the best, Whispering their scandals, glorifying the rest, Jmpious, and yet gainst all ills but your owne, The hotest sweaters of religion. Whose poysons all things to your spleenes peruert, And all streames measure by the Fount your heart, That are in nought but misrule regulare, To whose eyes all seeme ill, but those that are, That hate yee know not why, nor with more cause, Giue whom yee most loue your prophane applause, That when Kings and their Peeres (whose piercing eies Broke through their broken sleepes and policies, Mens inmost Cabinets disclose and hearts; Whose hands Ioues ballance (weighing all desarts) Haue let downe to them; which graue conscience, Charg'd with the blood and soule of Jnnocence. Holds with her white hand, (when her either skole, Apt to be sway'd with euery graine of Soule, Her selfe swaies vp or downe, to heauen or hell, Approue an action) you must yet conceale, A deeper insight, and retaine a taint To cast vpon the pure soule of a Saint. Away, in our milde Sphere doth nothing moue, But all-creating, all preseruing Loue, At whose flames, vertues, lighted euen to starres, All vicious Enuies, and seditious Iars, Bane-spitting Murmures and detracting Spels, Bannish with curses to the blackest hels: Defence of Beauty and of Innocence, And taking off the chaines of Insolence, From their prophan'd and godlike Lineaments, Actions heroique, and diuine descents, All the sweet Graces, euen from death reuiu'd, And sacred fruites, from barren Rockes deriu'd, Th' Immortall Subiects of our Nuptials are: Thee then (iust scourge of factious populare; Fautor of peace, and all the powers that moue In sacred Circle of religious Loue; Fountaine of royall learning, and the rich Treasure of Counsailes, and mellifluous speech:) Let me inuoke, that one drop of thy spring May spirit my aged Muse, and make her sing, As if th'inspir'd brest, of eternall youth Had lent her Accents, and all-mouing truth. The Kingdome that the gods so much did loue, And often feasted all the Powers aboue: At whose prime beauties the enamour'd Sunne, His Morning beames lights, and doth ouerrunne The world with Ardor (Æthiopia) Bore in her throne diuine Andromeda, To Cepheus and Cassiope his Queene: Whose boundlesse beauties, made ore'flow the spleene Of euery Neirid, for surpassing them: The Sun to her, resign'd his Diadem: And all the Deities, admiring stood, Affirming nothing mou'd, like flesh and blood: Thunder would court her with words sweetly phraz'd, And lightning stucke 'twixt heau'n and earth amaz'd. This matchlesse virgin had a mother too, That did for beautie, and for wisdome goe Before the formost Ladies of her time: To whom of super-excellence the crime Was likewise lai'd by Iuno, and from hence Pin'd Enuie suckt, the poison of offence. No truth of excellence, was euer seene, But bore the venome of the Vulgares spleene. And now the much enrag'd Neireides Obtain'd of him that moues the marble seas (To wreake the vertue, they cal'd Jnsolence) A whale so monstrous, and so past defence, That all the royall Region he laid wast, And all the noblest edifices rac't: Nor from his plague, were strongest Cities free, His bodies vast heape rag'd so heauily. With noblest names and bloods is still embrewd The monstrous beast, the rauenous Multitude. This plague thus preying vpon all the land, With so incomprehensible a hand: The pious virgin of the father sought, By Oracles to know, what cause had brought Such banefull outrage ouer all his State, And what might reconcile the Deities hate. His orisons and sacrifices past, The Oracle gaue answere, that the waste His Country suffered, neuer would conclude, Till his Andromeda he did extrude, To rapine of the Monster, he (good man,) Resolu'd to satiate the Leuiathan: With her, before his Country, though he lou'd Her past himselfe, and bore a spirit mou'd To rescue Innocence in any one That was to him, or his, but kindly knowne, To grace, or profite; doe them any good That lay in swift streame of his noblest blood, Constant to all, yet to his deerest seed, (For rights sake) flitting: thinking true indeed, The generall vprore, that t'was sinne in her, That made men so exclaime, and gods conferre Their approbation: saying the Kingdomes bale Must end by her exposure to the Whale: With whom the Whale-like vulgare did agree, And their foule spleenes, thought her impiety, Her most wise mother yet, the sterne intent, Vow'd with her best endeauour to preuent. And tolde her what her father did addresse; Shee (fearefull) fled into the wildernesse: And to th' instinct of sauage beasts would yeeld, Before a father that would cease to shield A daughter, so diuine and Jnnocent: Her feet were wing'd, and all the search out went, That after her was ordered: but shee flew, And burst the winds that did incenst pursue, And with enamoured sighes, her parts assaile, Plaide with her haire, and held her by the vaile: From whom shee brake, and did to woods repaire: Still where shee went, her beauties dide the ayre, And with her warme blood, made proud Flora blush: But seeking shelter in each shadie bush: Beauty like fire, comprest, more strength receiues And shee was still seene shining through the leaues. Hunted from thence, the Sunne euen burn'd to see, So more then Sunne-like a Diuinity, Blinded her eyes, and all inuasion seekes To dance vpon the mixture of her cheekes, Which show'd to all, that follow'd after far, As vnderneath the roundure of a starre, The euening skie is purple'd with his beames: Her lookes fir'd all things with her loues extreames. Her necke a chaine of orient pearle did decke, The pearles were faire, but fairer was her necke: Her breasts (laid out) show'd all enflamed sights Loue, lie a sunning, twixt two Crysolites: Her naked wrists showde, as if through the skie, A hand were thrust, to signe the Deitie Her hands, the confines, and digestions were Of Beauties world; Loue fixt his pillars there. Her eyes that others caught, now made her caught, Who to her father, for the whale was brought, Bound to a barraine Rocke, and death expected; But heau'n hath still such Jnnocence protected: Beauty needs feare no Monsters, for the sea, (Mother of Monsters) sent Alcyone, To warrant her, not onely gainst the waues, But all the deathes hid in her watrie graues. The louing birds flight made about her still, (Still good presaging) shew'd heau'ns sauing will: Which cheering her, did comfort all the shore That mourn'd in shade of her sad eyes before: Her lookes to perle turn'd peble, and her locks To burnisht gold transform'd the burning Rocks. And now came roring to the tied, the Tide All the Neireides deckt in all their pride Mounted on Dolphins, roade to see their wreake The waues fom'd with their enuies; that did speake In mutest fishes, with their leapes aloft For brutish ioy of the reuenge they sought. The people greedie of disastrous sights And newes, (the food of idle appetites From the kings Chamber, straight knew his intent, And almost his resolu'd thoughts did preuent Jn drie waues beating thicke about the Shore And then came on the prodegie, that bore Jn one masse mixt their Image; that still spread A thousand bodies vnder one sole head Of one minde still to ill all ill men are Strange sights and mischiefes fit the Populare. Upon the Monster red Rhamnusia rode, The Sauage leapt beneath his bloody load Mad of his prey, giu'n ouer now by all: When any high, haue any meanes to fall, Their greatest louers proue false props to proue it And for the mischiefe onely, praise and loue it. There is no good they will not then commend, Nor no Religion but they will pretend A mighty title to, when both are vs'd, To warrant Innouation, or see brus'd The friendlesse Reed, that vnder all feet lies: The sound parts euermore, they passe like flies, And dwell vpon the sores, ill in themselues, They clearely saile with ouer rockes and shelues, But good in others shipwracke in the Deepes: Much more vniust is he that truely keepes Lawes for more shew, his owne ends vnderstood Then he that breakes them for anothers good. And 'tis the height of all malignity, To tender good so, that yee ill implie: To treade on Pride but with a greater pride. VVhen where no ill, but in ill thoughts is tri'd, To speake well is a charity diuine: The rest retaine the poyson serpentine Vnder their lips, that sacred liues condemne, And wee may worthily apply to them, This tragicke execration: perish hee That sifts too far humane infirmity. But as your cupping glasses still exhale The humour that is euer worst of all Jn all the flesh: So these spic't conscienc't men The worst of things explore still, and retaine. Or rather, as in certaine Cities were Some ports through which all rites piaculare, All Executed men, all filth were brought, Of all things chast, or pure, or sacred, nought Entring or issuing there: so curious men, Nought manly, elegant, or not vncleane, Embrace, or bray out: Acts of staine are still Their Syrens, and their Muses: Any ill Js to their appetites, their supreme good, And sweeter then their necessary food. All men almost in all things they apply The By the Maine make, and the Maine the By. Thus this sweete Ladies sad exposure was Of all these moodes in men, the only glasse: But now the man that next to Ioue comptrold The triple world got with a shoure of gold: (Armed with Medusa's head, and Enyos eye: The Adamantine sword of Mercury The helme of Pluto, and Minerua's Mirror, That from the Gorgus made his passe with Terror) Came to the rescue of this enuied mayd: Drew neere, and first, in admiration stay'd That for the common ill of all the land, She the particular obloquie should stand: And that a beauty, no lesse then diuine Should men and women finde so serpentine As but to thinke her any such euent: Much lesse that eies and hands should giue consent To such a danger and to such a death. But though the whole Realme laboured vnderneath So foule an error, yet since Ioue and he Tendred her beauty, and integretie, In spight of all the more he set vp spirrit To doe her right; the more all wrong'd her merit, He that both vertue had, and beauty too Equall with her to both knew what to doe: The Ruthles still go laught at to the Graue Those that no good will doe, no goodnesse haue: The minde a spirit is, and cal'd the glasse In which we see God; and corporeall grace The mirror is, in which we see the minde. Amongst the fairest women you could finde Then Perseus, none more faire; mongst worthiest men, No one more manly: This the glasse is then To shew where our complexion is combinde; A womans beauty, and a manly minde: Such was the halfe-diuine-borne Troian Terror Where both Sex graces, met as in their Mirror. Perseus of Loues owne forme, those fiue parts had Which some giue man, that is the loueliest made: Or rather that is loueliest enclin'd, And beares (with shape) the beauty of the mind: Young was he, yet not youthfull, since mid-yeeres, The golden meane holds in mens loues and feares: Aptly composde, and soft (or delicate) Flexible (or tender) calme (or temperate) Of these fiue, three, make most exactly knowne, The Bodies temperate complexion: The other two, the order doe expresse, The measure and whole Trim of comelinesse. A temperate corporature (learn'd Nature saith) A smooth, a soft, a solid flesh bewrayeth: Which state of body shewes th'affections State Jn all the humours, to be moderate; For which cause, soft or delicate they call Our conquering Perseus, and but yong withall, Since time or yeeres in men too much reuolu'd, The subtiler parts of humour being resolu'd, More thicke parts rest, of fire and aire the want, Makes earth and water more predominant: Flexible they calde him, since his quicke conceit, And pliant disposition, at the height Tooke each occasion, and to Acts approu'd, As soone as he was full inform'd, he mou'd, Not flexible, as of inconstant state, Nor soft, as if too much effeminate, For these to a complexion moderate (Which we before affirme in him) imply, A most vnequall contrariety. Composure fit for Ioues sonne Perseus had, And to his forme, his mind fit answere made: “As to be lou'd, the fairest fittest are; “To loue so to, most apt are the most faire, “Light like it selfe, transparent bodies makes, “At ones act, th'other ioint impression takes. “Perseus, (as if transparent) at first sight, “Was shot quite thorough with her beauties light: “Beauty breedes loue, loue consummates a man. “For loue, being true, and Eleutherean, “No Jniurie nor contumelie beares; “That his beloued, eyther feeles or feares, “All good-wils enterchange it doth conclude “And mans whole summe holds, which is gratitude: “No wisdome, noblesse, force of armes, nor lawes, “Without loue, wins man, his compleat applause: “Loue, makes him valiant, past all else desires “For Mars, that is, of all heau'ns erring fires “Most full of fortitude (since he inspires “Men with most valour) Cytherea tames: “For when in heau'ns blunt Angels shine his flames, “Or he, his second or eight house ascends “Of rul'd Natiuities; and then portends “Ill to the then-borne: Venus in aspect “Sextile, or Trine doth (being conioyn'd) correct “His most malignitie: And when his starre “The birth of any gouernes (fit for warre “The Jssue making much to wrath enclin'd “And to the ventrous greatnesse of the minde) “Jf Venus neere him shine she doth not let “His magnanimity, but in order set “The vice of Anger making Mars more milde “And gets the mastry of him in the childe: “Mars neuer masters her; but if she guide “She loue inclines: and Mars set by her side “Her fires more ardent render, with his heat: “So that if he at any birth be set “In th'house of Venus, Libra, or the Bull, “The then-borne burnes, and loues flames feels at full. “Besides, Mars still doth after Venus moue “Venus not after Mars: because, of Loue “Boldnesse is hand-maid, Loue not so of her: “For not because men, bold affections beare “Loues golden nets doth their affects enfold; “But since men loue, they therefore are more bold “And made to dare, euen Death, for their belou'd, “And finally, Loues Fortitude is prou'd “Past all, most cleerely; for this cause alone “All things submit to Loue, but loue to none. “Celestials, Animals, all Corporeall things, “Wisemen, and Strong, Slaue-rich, and Free-borne Kings “Are loues contributories; no guifts can buy, “No threats can loue constraine, or terrifie “For loue is Free, and his Jmpulsions still Spring from his owne free, and ingenious will. Not God himselfe, would willing loue enforce But did at first decree, his liberall course: Such is his liberty, that all affects All arts and Acts, the minde besides directs To some wish't recompence, but loue aspires To no possessions, but his owne desires: As if his wish in his owne sphere did moue, And no reward were worthy Loue but Loue. Thus Perseus stood affected, in a Time When all loue, but of riches was a crime A fancy and a follie. And this fact To adde to loues deseruings, did detract; For twas a Monster and a monstrous thing Whence he should combat out, his nuptiall ring, The monster vulgar thought, and conquerd gaue The combatant already, the foule graue Of their fore-speakings, gaping for him stood And cast out fumes as from the Stigian flood Gainst his great enterprise, which was so fit For Ioues cheefe Minion, that Plebeian wit Could not conceiue it: Acts that are too hie For Fames crackt voice, resound all Jnfamie: O poore of vnderstanding: if there were Of all your Acts, one onely that did beare Mans worthie Image, euen of all your best Which truth could not discouer, to be drest In your owne ends, which Truths selfe not compels, But couers in your bottoms, sinckes and hels. Whose opening would abhor the sunne to see (So ye stood sure of safe deliuerie Being great with gaine or propagating lust) A man might feare your hubbubs; and some trust Giue that most false Epiphonem, that giues Your voice, the praise of gods: but view your liues With eyes impartiall, and ye may abhorre To censure high acts, when your owne taste more Of damned danger: Perseus scorn'd to feare The ill of good Acts, though hel-mouth gap't there: Came to Andromeda; sat by, and cheerd: But she that lou'd, through all the death she fear'd, At first sight, like her Louer: for his sake Resolu'd to die, ere he should vndertake A combat with a Monster so past man To tame or vanquish, though of Ioue he wanne A power past all men els, for man should still Aduance his powers to rescue good from ill, Where meanes of rescue seru'd: and neuer where Uentures of rescue, so impossible were That would encrease the danger: two for one Expose to Ruine: Therefore she alone Would stand the Monsters Fury and the Shame Of those harsh bands: for if he ouercame The monstrous world would take the monsters part So much the more: and say some sorcerouse art Not his pure valour, nor his Jnnocence Preuail'd in her deliuerance her offence Would still the same be counted, for whose ill The Land was threatned by the Oracle. The poisoned Murmures of the multitude. Rise more, the more, desert or power obtrude: Against their most (sayd he) come J the more: Vertue, in constant sufferance we adore. Nor could death fright him, for he dies that loues: And so all bitternesse from death remoues. He dies that loues, because his euery thought, (Himselfe forgot) in his belou'd is wrought. Jf of himselfe his thoughts are not imploy'd Nor in himselfe they are by him enioy'd. And since not in himselfe, his minde hath Act (The mindes act chiefly being of thought compact) Who workes not in himselfe, himselfe not is: For, these two are in man ioynt properties, To worke, and Be; for Being can be neuer But Operation, is combined euer. Nor Operation, Being doth exceed, Nor workes man where he is not: still his deed His being, consorting, no true Louers minde He in himselfe can therefore euer finde Since in himselfe it workes not, if he giues Being from himselfe, not in himselfe he liues: And he that liues not, dead is, Truth then said That whosoeuer is in loue, is dead. Jf death the Monster brought then, he had laid A second life vp, in the loued Mayd: And had she died, his third life Fame decreed, Since death is conquer'd in each liuing deed: Then came the Monster on, who being showne His charmed sheild, his halfe he turn'd to stone And through the other with his sword made way: Till like a ruin'd Cittie, dead he lay Before his loue: The Neirids with a shrieke And Syrens (fearefull to sustaine the like) And euen the ruthlesse and the sencelesse Tide Before his howre, ran roring terrifi'd, Backe to their strength: wonders and monsters both, With constant magnanimitie, like froth Sodainely vanish, smother'd with their prease; No wonder lasts but vertue: which no lesse We may esteeme, since t'is as seldome found Firme &amp; sincere, and when no vulgar ground Or flourish on it, fits the vulgar eye Who viewes it not but as a prodegie? Plebeian admiration, needes must signe All true-borne Acts, or like false fires they shine: Jf Perseus for such warrant had contain'd His high exploit, what honour had he gain'd? Who would haue set his hand to his designe But in his skorne? skorne censures things diuine: True worth (like truth) sits in a groundlesse pit And none but true eyes see the depth of it Perseus had Enyos eye, and saw within That grace, which out-lookes, held a desperate sin: He, for it selfe, with his owne end went on, And with his louely rescu'd Paragon Long'd of his Conquest, for the latest shocke: Dissolu'd her chaines, and tooke her from the rocke Now woing for his life that fled to her As hers in him lay: Loue did both confer To one in both: himselfe in her he found She with her selfe, in onely him was crownd: While thee J loue (sayd he) you louing mee In you J finde my selfe: thought on by thee, And I (lost in my selfe by thee neglected) In thee recouer'd am, by thee affected: The same in me you worke, miraculous strange Twixt two true Louers is this enterchange, For after J haue lost my selfe, if I Redeeme my selfe by thee, by thee supply I of my selfe haue, if by thee I saue My selfe so lost, thee more then me I haue. And neerer to thee, then my selfe I am Since to my selfe no otherwise I came Then by thee being the meane: In mutuall loue One onely death and two reuiuals moue: For he that loues, when he himselfe neglects Dies in himselfe once, In her he affects Straight he renewes, when she with equall fire Embraceth him, as he did her desire: Againe he liues too, when he surely seeth Himselfe in her made him: O blessed death Which two liues follow: O Commerce most strange Where, who himselfe doth for another change, Nor hath himselfe, nor ceaseth still to haue: O gaine, beyond which no desire can craue, When two are so made one, that either is For one made two, and doubled as in this: Who one life had: one interuenient death Makes him distinctly draw a two fold breath: Jn mutuall Loue the wreake most iust is found, When each so kill that each cure others wound; But Churlish Homicides, must death sustaine, For who belou'd, not yeelding loue againe And so the life doth from his loue deuide Denies himselfe to be a Homicide? For he no lesse a Homicide is held, That man to be borne lets: then he that kild A man that is borne: He is bolder farre That present life reaues: but he crueller That to the to-be borne, enuies the light And puts their eyes out, ere they haue their sight. All good things euer we desire to haue, And not to haue alone, but still to saue: All mortall good, defectiue is, and fraile; Unlesse in place of things, on point to faile, Ve daily new beget. That things innate May last, the languishing we re'create In generation, re'creation is, And from the prosecution of this Man his instinct of generation takes. Since generation, in continuance, makes Mortals, similitudes, of powers diuine, Diuine worth doth in generation shine. Thus Perseus sayd, and not because he sau'd Her life alone, be her in marriage crau'd: But with her life, the life of likely Race Was chiefe end of his action, in whose grace Her royall father brought him to his Court With all the then assembled glad resort Of Kings and Princes: where were solemniz'd Th'admired Nuptialls: which great Heau'n so priz'd That Ioue againe stoopt in a goulden showre T'enrich the Nuptiall as the Natall howre Of happy Perseus: white-armd Iuno to Depos'd her greatnesse, and what she could do To grace the Bride &amp; Bride-groome, was vouchsaft All Subiect-deities stoopt to: and the Shaft Golden and mutuall, with which loue comprest Both th'enuied Louers: offerd to, and kist: All answerablie feasted to their States: In all the Starres beames, stoopt the reuerend Fates: And the rere banquet, that fore ranne the Bed With his presage shut vp, and seconded: And sayd they sung verse, that Posteritie Jn no age should reproue, for Perfidie. Parcarum Epithalamion. O you this kingdomes glory that shall be Parents to so renownd a Progenie As earth shall enuie, and heauen glory in, Accept of their liues threds, which Fates shal spin Their true spoke oracle, and liue to see Your sonnes sonnes enter such a Progenie, As to the last times of the world shall last: Haste you that guide the web, haste spindles haste. See Hesperus, with nuptiall wishes crownd, Take and enioy; In all ye wish abound, Abound, for who should wish crowne with her store But you that slew what barren made the shore? You that in winter, make your spring to come Your Summer needs must be Elisium: A race of mere soules springing, that shall cast Their bodies off in cares, and all ioyes taste. Haste then that sacred web, haste spindles haste. Joue loues not many, therefore let those few That his guifts grace, affect still to renew: For none can last the same; that proper is To onely more then Semideities: To last yet by renewing, all that haue More merit then to make their birth their graue, As in themselues life, life in others saue: First to be great seeke, then lou'd, then to last: Haste you that guide the web, haste spindles haste. She comes, ô Bridegroom shew thy selfe enflam'd And of what tender tinder Loue is flam'd: Catch with ech sparke, her beauties hurle about: Nay with ech thoght of her be rapt throughout; Melt let thy liuer, pant thy startled heart: Mount Loue on earthquakes in thy euery part: A thousand hewes on thine, let her lookes cast; Dissolue thy selfe to be by her embrac't, Haste ye that guide the web, haste spindles haste. As in each bodie, there is ebbe and flood Of blood in euery vaine, of spirits in blood; Of Ioyes in spirits, of the Soule in Ioyes, And nature through your liues, this change imploies To make her constant: so each minde retaines Manners and customs, where vicicitude reignes: Opinions, pleasures, which such change enchains. And in this enterchange all man doth last, Haste then who guide the web, haste spindles haste. Who bodie loues best, feedes on dantiest meats, Who fairest seed seekes, fairest women gets: Who loues the minde, with loueliest disciplines Loues to enforme her, in which verity shines. Her beauty yet, we see not, since not her: But bodies (being her formes) who faire formes beare We view, and chiefely seeke her beauties there. The fairest then, for faire birth, see embrac't, Haste ye that guide the web, haste spindles haste. Starres ye are now, and ouershine the earth: Starres shall ye be heereafter, and your birth In bodies rule heere, as your selues in heau'n, What heer Detraction steals, shall there be giuen: The bo?d that heer you freed shal triumph there The chaine that touch't her wrists shal be a starre Your beauties few can view, so bright they are: Like you shalbe your birth, with grace disgrac't Haste ye that rule the web, haste spindles haste. Thus by diuine instinct, the fates enrag'd, Of Perseus and Andromeda presag'd Who, (when the worthy nuptial State was done And that act past, which only two makes one, Flesh of each flesh and bone of eithers bone) Left Cepheus Court; both freed and honoured. The louing Victor, and blest Bride-groome led Home to the Seriphins, his rescu'd Bride; Who (after issue highly magnifi'd Both rapt to heau'n, did constellations reigne, And to an Asterisme was turn'd the chaine That onely touch't his grace of flesh &amp; blood, In all which stands the Fates kinde Omen good. APODOSIS. Thus through the Fount of stormes (the cruell seas) Her Monsters and malignant deities, Great Perseus made high and triumphant way To his starre crownd deed, and bright Nuptiall day. And thus doe you, that Perseus place supply In our Ioues loue, get Persean victorie Of our Land Whale, foule Barbarisme, and all His brood of pride, and liues Atheisticall: That more their pallats and their purses prise Then propagating Persean victories: Take Monsters parts, not aucthor manly parts: For Monsters kill the Man-informing Arts: And like a lothed prodegie despise The rapture that the Arts doth naturalise, Creating and immortalising men: Who scornes in her the Godheads vertue then, The Godheads selfe hath boldnesse to despise, And hate not her, but their Eternities: Seeke vertues loue, and vicious flatteries hate, Heere is no true sweete, but in knowing State. Who Honor hurts, neglecting vertues loue, Commits but Rapes on pleasures; for not Ioue His power in thunder hath, or downeright flames, But his chiefe Rule, his Loue and Wisedome frames. You then, that in loues strife haue ouercome The greatest Subiect blood of Crhistendome, The greatest subiect minde take, and in Both Be absolute man: and giue that end your oth. So shall my sad astonisht Muse arriue At her chiefe obiect: which is, to reuiue By quickning honor, in the absolute best: And since none are, but in Eternitie, blest, He that in paper can register things That Brasse and Marble shall denie euen Kings: Should not be trod on by ech present flash: The Monster slaine then, with your cleere Seas, wash From spots of Earth, Heauens beauty in the minde In which, through death, hath all true Noblesse shinde.
