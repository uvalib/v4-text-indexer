      <field name="fulltext">MARYANNE. I.AgeâEight Years. The lark unseen, o'er the village spire, Sings like an echo from the sky. âLet us go, Mother! the first bell has rung; The second rings hastily now,â Said little Maryanne, As she ran to the door and looked over the fields, Standing still in the Sunday air, With their patches of meadow and tall dry corn, And hedges sharp between. Her cautious mother shuts the door, And leads her forth to the belfry's call; So little Maryanne, With her knitted nankeen bonnet on, That shaded half her face, went by Each cottage with a sober smile. The bell chimed louder as they walked; In folded stillness white, the clouds Seem cradled by the sound. âMother,â said she, âwill father sing Psalms by himself upon the hills? Or do the sheep as well as I Know Sunday from the common days?â They pass into the churchyard now, A pigmy hunch of sward, All rank and long, with sunken stones Looking up here and there; But quite a strange great wilderness To little Maryanne; And the old men, in sauntering groups, Who gossiped o'er their staves to her Were grave and kingly patriarchs. The laird has come to church to-day: How glad is Maryanneâ She will look at him all the while! Now hear the textâ In the days of thy youth remember God. And when old thou wilt not forget him. II.AgeâSixteen Years. I've come o'er the fields to meet thee, lass, O'er the misty meadows green; Before the sun has dried the grass, Or the earliest lark was seen. I've come through the rye to meet thee, lass, All through the rye-rigs deep; Before the cloud from the hill might pass,â While the plover is fast asleep. My father's wains are on the highway, We will meet them by the tree, And ride to the town, so blithe and gay, In each other's company. Then dip thy face in the water clear, Lave it over thy shoulders fair; And quickly lace thy bodice, dear, And snood up thy parted hair. For I've come through the rye to meet thee, lass, O'er the misty meadows green, Before the cloud from the hill might pass, Before plover or lark was seen. III.AgeâSeventeen. âYour mother tells me, simple girl, You are to be a semstress now; I like to see a blush: take off Your shapeless cap. Do you read and write?â And dance and sing, perhaps, as well? The freshness of new hay is on your hair, And the withdrawing innocence of home Within your eyes, indeed You are as pretty a child as I have seen. If your new world shall wed you as the old Seems to have wooed, you're fortunate: You have a throng of comrades here,â Said a well-bedizened dame, While timid Maryanne She led to a long chamber, where Her thimbled girls with needles and shears Were trimming silks with gimp and lace. Anon the dragon leaves the cell, And about the stranger girl they press! âSit here, young rose,âââNay, Catherine; How to turn her smiles to use, And braid fair locks unbound before, I know the best: her looks refresh Like oranges in a theatre.â But timid Maryanneâ Both no and yes she feared to say; She knew not what they meant; And aye she cast a wondering glance At every one that spoke; But Joan withdrew her from them all, And leaning o'er her, whispered, âSweet, None may hear us; tell me true, Have you left a lover-lad Behind you, by the plough?â âI never thought of such a thing,â Said timid Maryanneâ As amidst their smothered laughter A glorious crimson spread Over her forehead, over her cheeks, And brightened round her neck. IV.AgeâEighteen. A year has gone since last the voice That taught her infant wordsâ Her mother's voiceâbrought early loves And patience to her mind. And many lisping tongues since then Have mimicked truth and hope; Or for the easy merchandise Of smiles have bartered praise. But how to meet her mother now?â And yet it must be done; She will be glad, thought Maryanne, To find a lady in her child. Andrew came with her; they had walked Two days to see her daughter; Poor Andrew! he was grave, he smiled, He pondered, and he hoped. But she did not run to meet them,â She did not push him back and laugh,â Nor kiss her mother's cheek. Scarce knew he, with a quivering lip, Which way to lookâher dress So jauntily assumed, her hair So 'tired, her head so cunningly Withheld, so cold her eye. He had brought a gift to her, But he wavered long, altho' Two weeks of labour it had cost, Whether he ought to offer it. They left herâsilent sat she long; Every word that had been said,â Each look she would recall: With her wide eyes fixed upon the floor, She neither smiled nor wept. A face bends over her drooping neck, So close, its breathing stirs her hair: Her red lips leap, her eyes expand, Her young heart flutters, throbs:âah! now She can both smile and weep! Her hand and heart, her body, her life She would give himâfreely give. Smother up the thoughts of ill! Heaven is around her, as he lisps âAll is prepared; come Marian, For ever come with me.â V.AgeâNineteen. In a neat suburban room Songs of pleasant liberty Sang careless Maryanne. Who would dream that such a change Could fall in one short year! And Joan was also there, Busily laughing, laughing loud. But Maryanne sat still and sang; Or with head askance at the window pane She looked for Archer along the road; And every morn, and noon, and night, She would dance acrosss the room for joy. O would it were not so intense! She was happier than a wife could be, Thought careless Maryanne. Her mother told her not to look Towards strangers, nor to speak too loud To her sister-semstresses, until She knew them well,âto rise betimes, To dress quite plain, to lace her shoes As she had learnt of old,âa long Unmentionable creed she taught Of best advices: Maryanne Believed some punishment would follow If in aught she disobeyed:â Yet had she dared! the bond was burst! No lightning flashed, but all at once A new sun seemed to smile on her, And a new moon, more earnest than the old, And stars more numerous; and kindly lips Seemed ever smiling on her from that day, And merry voices sounded merrier. For the first time free will seemed hers:â While her mother like a prophetess, Whose oracle by adverse fate Had been annulled, sank from her trust Altogether,âaltogether! Who would dream that such a change Could come in a year like leaves in spring! VI. How fresh the breeze is everywhere! How blossom out the flowers so fair! The primrose and the daffodil, And mignonette scenting the household air, Over the narrow sill. The wind has softer wings than e'er Were felt before! the flowers appear Than any other flowers more bright, Like angel eyes so wide and clear. From whence this dear delight? The window looks unto the west O'er placarded walls: oh, blest Is every stone and every seam! And every chimney smoke caressed Is but a pleasant dream! The errand boy comes whistling by, And sits down on the kerbstone nigh! Blithe as an infant-god Who never might either grow old or die, In spite of his weary load. âWill you take a little wine?â âWhatever you like shall be mine.â The air is sweet and mild indeed; These market-men are scarce divine! Is it true a lamb can bleed? Are there footsteps on the stair? Is the sun in the noonday air? Maryanne! you are so still, Yours is sure a happy share In this sweet, sweet world of ill. VII.AgeâTwenty. But how felt he who opened first Those gates that never close To the bewildered footstep hurrying on? We may listen while he talks. âLife is like a melody no doubt, An ever-changing melody, that ne'er Runs through the scale: the plectrum's held By love's own hand, they say:â I' faith his hand should be made of gold!â Quoth he one evening, as a friend Broke in upon his gloom. âwhat, Archer! moody;âstrange indeed When marian is yours! I have seen her, such an air Of the reposing dancer, blent With girlish homebred quietness!â So delicately she has gained A taste like pure simplicity.â âOh, she is perfect grace, refined, Yet marvellously fresh; More wine, dear Thorn?âââYes, yes, more wine.â âYou must know herâââAnd must love?â âAh! why not?âââWell, be it so!â Two weeks therefrom, said Maryanne: âJoan, I wonder what he means By never coming; his handsome friend Laughs at him too.âââForget him dear; How richly all our wants are filled Since he is gone.âââIndeed they are,â Said Maryanne, and gave a laugh Of scorn so very like Joan's! VIII.AgeâTwenty-one. âThis bonnet's really a charming change, Its white rose tint suits mine so well; But here's an awkward scarf indeed, Although it be Cashmere.â âThat will not matter, we will drive: Jacob! are the horses out?â âWho's he that wears the forage-cap, Who rides so hurriedly?â âThat moustachioed ensign nodsâ How jauntily he sways himself Upon the square toe of his boot!â âThese ladiesâdo you know their names?â âOh! This one is Thorn's Marian,â Madame Marian, hey dey!â Questionable, clumsy too.â âShall we return now?âââWhen you please.â Such are snatches of the talk Of loungers not worth verse at all. âNow mark the blush, the earnestness O'ermantling that young man's face; 'Tis like a May-day morning,â Almost as sweet as honey: As yet he is an innocent!ââ With a gay sad cunning, quoth she now, Beneath the glittering chandelier. The music swells, and dies and wakes, Like a spirit after death; Upon a languid ottoman She sinks and seems almost asleep; But a snake, with a sickly skin, lifts up Its sharp head to her heart. Her father, mother, sister, friend,â They are not here; and those who are Scoff at her, cheapen her, she knows. She cannot quell her quivering lip; She weeps and laughs, and weeps again, For the tears are strongest now. IX.AgeâTwenty-three. The chill of eve is stayed from closing yet By the roseate golden streaks Still pressing back the leaden dusk; Day, like an eye that's loth to sleep, Closes but by slow degrees. Andrew stands by the bolted door Of a cottage lone and dark; His finger bent as if to knock,â Yet he pauses ere it falls, And hesitating draws his breath. A cat sits on the thatch-roof top With its tail wrapt round its feet: On the deep-set lattice from within Flickers the sinking fire. The door is opened; by the hearth Down he sits. He came not there To seek her who so oft had led His footsteps night and mornâ At morn before the plover was seen. No! she will not be there again, To hear her father's whining prayers, Or see her mother's wrinkles deepen, While her broken-spirited sister fears To sing as she prepares the meals. Still he satâfew words were said, Though oft he fain would speak: âHave you heard of Maryanne?â Her mother cried at last As with frail hand his stalwart arm She seized, but he was mute; And when he spoke his words fell dead, Like an echo of her constant thoughts. Her hand slid from his arm, she leant Quietly over the fire; Anon a tear was heard To hiss on the burning coals, As spired away the feeble smoke Through the roof's dark chimney-gap (A sacrifice of suffering), To the stars that sparkled high. X. Bring me wine at eventide, And poppy-juice to-morrow! Can I forget the courtly pride, Or go to bed with sorrow? They called me marian the knave, Marian the fortunate! How kind unto the woman-slave To bid her thank her fate. Bring me wine! it may not be That I throw up the game, Nor sink to scorn contentedly With a brain and a heart of flame. I am forsaken: not a wheel Rings on the causeway-stones; Bring wine! in laughter let me reel, Lest the vile may sayâshe moans. Bring me wine at eventide, And poppy-juice to-morrow! Shall I forget the days of pride, Or go to bed with sorrow? XI.AgeâTwenty-four. âHow are you, Archer? shall we ride An hour together this fine evening? People seem enfranchised, winged, Like a colony of birds Circling about the tree-tops for an hour Before they dive into their nests. Have you heard of Marian? They say no one can know Where she has sunk since Thorn, your friend, Left her and his debts together.â She had no wit, no management, It might have been presaged;â I fear she never will retrieve; She meets the rapids in the stream: The world's eye now will turn on her Like slingers from an old town-wall Inflicting useless wounds.â While thus they ride and speculate On her fate with listless ease, Where is she, and what doth she? Can we find her if we search? Venture down that lane, for guide Take the policeman. In that house Where lights flare all night long, Here ye her voice, like lyre-strings once, Now screaming in spite and rage. 'Tis Sunday morning, almost day, Though pale and cold and blue: Hovering pigeons venture down On the noiseless streets to glean; The steeple-clock chimes slow and loud; Doth she sit still, or hath she slunk To her couch to wake or sleep? Neither; she snores upon the floor, With the flask beside her head. XII. What is love? The fevered hand, The palpitating heart, The visions light as airy bells, That buoy the inexperienced wish, And clothe in transient paradise The common life of every day, Until necessity becomes a pain; When the voice is only heard in song, Deliciously exulting, like a bird Full of summer's golden hours,â Or weeping passionately loud Unto the pillowed night? And is this love? Shy girlhood answers âyes.â Or is it the gentler harmony Of mind and act and hope,â A welding up of careworn truths With all the beautiful and good,â A binding link of confidence,â A staff in the traveller's hand, A music to the soldier's march That charms his weariness,â An interbreath of soul with soul Of which all life is typical? Oh, such hath our God made love! He, the youth who wooed of old, Her who is now forgot by all, What time the cricket's chirm succeeds The grasshoppers, wends towards his home, A man, a home of every day. He knows the window and the light That shines from it he knows: Each thing within the room so well He knows its face, so long has known, It seems a household god that claims His reverence or his care. He doffs his shoes contentedly, And draws his seat beside the fire; Slumber is on his child, his dame Sews tiny frills that it may wear, As ever-anon she turns a glance Upon its open-mouthed repose. Happy he seems with a quiet peace,â But toils he not by the loom all day? Aye, and each hour is as a wedge To steady his advance to age, When around him shall have grown Stalwart sons with shoulders broad, And daughters with long Eve-like hair, And noiseless step along the floor. The blind child-god of love hath lent His wings unto the hours, and smiles As they hurry past like bees. Love! whom Anacreon's nymphs scarce pleased, Who listened to Arcadian lutes And thought them wearisome,â Unto the shuttle lends his ear! XIII.AgeâTwenty-five. Down the wet pavement gleam the lamps, While the wind whistles past them shrill; A distant heel rings hurrying home, It lessens into stillness now, And she is left alone. The rain-drops from the eves are blown Against her face: she turns; The wind lifts up her dripping scarf, Faded now with its ragged fringe, And flings it over her head. Her lips are sharp, as if a scorn Of our humanity had shrunk And bitten them; her eyesâ They are not sunk, for generous care Is not her misery, They never weep, for she can think Of her childhood while she laughs, But they are blind and insolent. And is this Maryanne the mild? Can it indeed be she? What is sin and what is shame? The brutish and the ignorant Say she hath borne them both. But why measure blood in a carved wine-cup, Or blame the blind altho' he laugh While funeral mutes pass by? Then whose the sin and whose the shame That the ignorant say are hers? Can the outcast retrace her steps; Would any mourn with her, although She washed the earth with tears From a rent and festering heart? The human voice no music brings To her, and the sun but shines That the shadow where she sits may be More dense, that she may feel the light In which the spider spins, Can unenlivening fall on such As have a soul. Yet hark! she sings, She sings as she wanders by. XIV. âOut of my house!â a screeching tongue Rings through the turnpike stair. With swollen eyes, and bloodless lips That would have uttered curses Had she dared to speak at all, A woman staggers into light, And crawls away again. She is a spot upon the sun, A foul thing on the street, A blight on the fields, a hateful sore Unto her sister woman: Without a friend, a child, a home,â Without the power to cling to them, Albeit she had them all. Stand up in the face of heaven, and ask Why art thou punished thus? The smoke of the chimneys rises straight And glowing in the yellow rays of even, That strike athwart their dusky tops And skimmer on the gilded balls of spires, Or western windows like a holiday. The hum of men decreases, and the sharp Shrill tongue of childhood now is heard alone, Until the mother from her window calls âTo bed.â On saunters Maryanne. Once-a-time, the harvest-queen, She bore the last bunch home, With honesty and admiration rife Among her followers: Once-a-time her necklace was of gold, Or triple gilt at least,â When a gleam of her silken sock had drawn The sighing furnace to a glow. She leaned herself against the wall, And longed for drink to slake her thirst And memory at once. A band of girls were at their play Beside her; in the midst sat one, And many hand in hand advanced Before her and retired At each rhyme as they sang. 1 Water, water wall-flower, Growing up so high, We are all maidens, We must all die. In especial Mary Anna, She is the whitest flower; She can skip and she can sing, And ding us, ding us ower! 2 A dis, a dis o' green grass, A daisy dis, a dis! Come all ye pretty maidens And dance along with this. And you shall have a duck so blue, And you shall have a drake, And you shall have a pretty young-man A dancing for your sake. She heard them as they sang, she stood As she were dead while still they sang; Then in her utter abandonment She loathed their loveliness. XV.AgeâUnknown. A white-washed chamber wide and long, With unscreened pallets placed in rows, Each tenanted by pain. In the first a grey-haired woman, tho' Still almost youthful: in the next A girl with yellow teeth and eyes, And lips as blue as heaven! One form is there we have marked before, Whose merriment we have heard. My God! And yet perhaps 'tis her best bourne: She shall not live to fight with dogs For bones on the nightly causeway, Or gather ashes thrifty wives May fling from their hearthstones. She may die! the board is sawn And blackened, and the turf Is soon rent up to lay her down: While forms as fair, as gleesome hearts, As blindly shall succeed her,âplace Their feet where she hath trod,âamid Like laughter shut their eyes,âand then Fill this her mattress, thus, with shaven crowns. And fathers still will shake their heads; And youths who have not souls, have beards; And scribes and pharisees cross the way; And country queans at harvest home Blush if they do not dance in silk; And every lamp on every street Light them like Maryanne. THE ARTIST'S BIRTHPLACE. This is the yeoman's country: every man Hath his own steading, his own field, his garth, And share of common and of moss, wherefrom He cuts his winter's fuel, building up The russet stack above his gable thatch. Look through that straggling unpruned hedge, you'll see One of those sinewy Saxons, such an one, From sire to son, perhaps hath till'd that mould, For these five hundred years; that rough-hewn block Of timber plays the part of harrow here. And now we reach the turn I told you of, Close to our journey's end. The violets Are just as thick as ever, and beneath The rooty sand-bank those white embers show A gypsey's bivouac has but late been here. And there is this old village, with its wide Irregular path, its rattling streamlet bridged Before each cottage with loose planks or stones, And all the geese and ducks that have no fear Of strangers, the wide smith's shop and the church Whose grey stone roof is within reach of hand. A fit place for an artist to be reared, Not a great Master whose vast toils unshared Add to the riches of the world, rebuild God's house, and clothe with prophets walls and roof, Defending cities as a pastime, such We have not! but the homlier heartier hand That gives us landscapes with their rustics' lives. There is his forebears' house; none other claims Such garden ground and wicket. We last met In London: I've heard since he had returned Homeward less sound in health than when he reached That athlete's theatre, well termed the grave Of reputations. Now refreshed again Let's hope to find him. Thus conversing stept Two townsmen forward: men whose usual ways Were through the thick of life; who had sought out And clasped each others hands with friendliest clasp, And who had now right willingly exiled Themselves together in those summer days, To harbour in a tile-floored village inn. Straight through the wicket passed they, and before The pent-roofed door stood knocking: all was still: Through the low parlour window books were seen Upon the little settle, and some pots With flowers, a birdcage hung too without song Close to the window; round them noontide glowed So gladsomely, the leaves were every one Glistening and quivering and the hosts of gnats Wove in the shades, but all within seemed dark And dead. A quick light foot is heard, and there, Before them stood a maiden in the shine That fell upon her chesnut hair like fire. How winsome fair she was 'tis hard to tell! For she was strong and straight, like a young elm, And without fear, although she halted there Answering with coy eyes turned towards the ground. Yet not embarassed, while she told the tale Of the sick man. Then felt the strangers free To look upon her: her tall neck was tinged With brown and bore her small head lightly like The head of a giraffe; her saffron jupe Tied loosely oe'r the bosom fell in folds Over her lithe waist,âbut, as hath been said, How winsome fair she was 'twas hard to tell. I might describe her from the head succinct, Even to the high-arched instep of her foot, And all in vain: the sincere soul, the full Yet homely harmony she bore with her, Moved me like the first sight of the sea, And made me think of old queens, Guenevere, Or maid Rowena with her âwaes-hail,â or Aslauga whom the Sea-king chanced upon, Keeping her sheep beside Norse waves, the while She made her matin mirror in the stream. The artist was not there to welcome them, That much was plain; and, more, the life of home Was not for him; Elspeth, the crazed beldame O' the village, shouted and sang by sometimes, And that he could not bear. This and much else, At the hedge ale-house, while the friends regaled By the wide chimney where the brown turf burned, And daylight glinted down, they heard. But still As of the damsel thought they most, one criedâ âI could have ta'en her head between my hands And kissed it on the crownâshe is so wise, I'm sure she never would have thought it strange.â TO THE GREAT SPHYNX: CONSIDERED AS THE SYMBOL OF RELIGIOUS MYSTERY. I. The silence of a moonless night The path of time doth follow: moonless night And starless tracks man's footsteps, with dim forms Still crumbling back into the caverned past. And thou the strangest legend wrought in stone The huge rock-spectre of an earlier world, Within that terrible darkness standest still, A mystery now as then. I shut my ears and hear Through the far centuries the clang Of Coptic hammers round thy limbs half-freed: Slaves toiling in their blindness, slaves of fate, And slaves of man! what mystic mutterings, What inspiration or what sad resolve,â Those laborers cheer that know not what they do? II. Oracular, ever open-eyed, Open-eyed without vision; answerless, Yet questioning for life or death, as hath In later days been fabled. The scarabee, the winged globe, And other symbols dark are known to thee, To thee and to the dead. Perhaps the bones Of Cheops in his firmest of all tombs, Shook to disclose thy secret from the dust And make men gods by knowledge of hereafter, Shook when the priests' thick steps passed evermore Bearing another Pharoah home Asbestos-clad to his subterrene realm. And did not Cleopatra's eager blood Throb at the thought of thee, While her wide purple flaunted in the sun, And the thick smoke of her perfumes was borne From Cidnus to the waste, where now The camel's tufted limb in thirsty march By Moslem pipe is cheered. The winged seeds of autumn die amidst The whirling sand-waste. Not beneath thy shade The sower walks. While the years ever young, Passing quick-sandall'd from the exuberant sun Awake new wonders, and new nations rise; And young Hope ever girdled, worshipeth Upon the steps of Truth's too radiant shrine; Thou sittest voiceless, without priest or prayer, As if thou wert self-born. III. And yet to whom, O Sphynx, Hast thou not ministered? Before the Isis gates, the gates of stone, Have mythic heroes and the sons of gods Questioned of thee. Around thy feet The hands of wandering Homer have perchance Groped in his blindness, while he smiled, Smiled strangely like old Saturn, as high thoughts, Thoughts level with thy mysteries, Lifted the lucid eyelids of his soul. The lyre of Hermes may have rung to thee, Before Dodona's leaves shook prophecies On slumbering votaries; ere the white shafts rose Fluted on Delphi, or Athenian streets Had heard the voice of Socrates, nor yet Was there a Calvary in all the world. The beacon-light from Pharos shines, Guiding the prows with Sidon's wares, Wine from Chios, Samian earth Transformed to gold by potters' cunning hands; Awhile it shines, and then the stars again Heaven's watchers are alone. But now instead Of monstrous hieroglyph, the preacher calls, Preacher and bishop, and the cenobite Hurries half naked by, Smiting thee on the face with his strong hand, Strong to destroy all gods save one, The Unseen, Unknown, unto whom thou art Thyself a minister, although unnamed In the evangel by whose word he lives, And by whose light he weaves the Thebaid straws. Weave on! lean cenobite, take not again The purple and fine linen, thou hast seen Bread brought to thee by ravens from heaven's board,â Souls passing upward upon angel's wings,â And like the red edge of averted thunder, Roll back the earthly, Typhon fall sheer down. Heaven's face is visible, and man's heart throbs Shedding joy-tears into the passion-cup; For are not all old things now passed? Alas! and he too is now passed, long since His love-feast cup is dry as Odin's shell, Yet heaven's face brightens still, and through the sand Deepening about thy flanks Cryest thou, O Sphynx, for burial with thy kin. IV. Hovering over phantom-mists On the chance stepping-stones of time; Descending the uneven stairs of Art, Into our nature's cavern gloom; Breathless almost become we, As if the blood fled from collapsing veins. And yet when we return Into the even sunlight of to-day, The interests of the present seem Fool's-play, unreal, an even-song; And all the living generation shrinks Into turf-hidden grasshoppers; loud-tongued As clamoring storks, that feebly build Among the cloven roofs of old And kingless cities; passing as a flock Of clouds storm-scattered, when the sear leaves fall, And day shrinks coldly in. But rather let me hear Derisive laughter than degenerate fears. And verily thou art, O Sphynx, no more Than a child's bauble which the man disowns With loftier knowledge, weightier cares,â Yet from the soul's profound, The most dread question comes,â Which nature cannot answer. Thou, Watcher by temple-stairs,â Thou might'st have taught the entering worshippers Homeward to look not starward, Inward and not back into the tomb, Or over Styx with hopes that bloom not here! Alas, and is the question still Unanswered, is the night Eternal upon Acheron? And when the triumphs of our England fall Crumbling before the tides of years to come, Shall Sphynxes stand by temple-stairs? Or from the heart's depths call? And shalt thou still Unburied sit amidst the sand? A RHYME OF LIFE. The dial is dark, 'Tis but half past one: But the crow is abroad, And the day's begun. The dial is dim, 'Tis but half past two: Fit the small foot With its neat first shoe. The light gains fast, Now 'tis half past three: The blossom appears All over the tree. The gnomon tells It is but half past four: Shut upon him The old school-door. The sun is strong, It is half past five: Through this and through that Let him hustle and strive. Ha, thunder and rain! It is half past six: Hither and thither, Go, wander and fix. The shadows are sharp, It is half past seven: The Titan dares To scale even heaven! The rain soon dries, It is half past eight: Time flies and flies, But it is not late! The sky now is clear, It is half past nine: Draw all the threads, Knot up, combine. Clearer and calmer, 'Tis half past ten: Count we the gains? Not yet: try again. The shadows lengthen, Half past eleven: He looks back, alas! Let the man be shriven! Evening mist falls, It is half past twelve: Hark, the bell tolls, Up, sexton, and delve! LINES Written in the Elgin Marble Room, British Museum, in the presence of the fragments of Ceres, the Fates, Hyperion, &amp;c., from the Parthenon. The fabled fire undying, in the shrine Of Vesta is long darkened. Anxious steps Have ceased to travel Delphi's steep, for lore Prophetic, rendering an exchange of gold. The intoxicating smoke through which appeared The phantom-actors in the Mysteries Hath vanished: brazen doors and sacredness Have not preserved the altar and the shrine, The Calathus and Cista; yea, the force Of Truth, for sure those fables sheltered truths Even of grandest import, hath scarce saved A record of the symbol or the creed. The spirit of the world that knows no sleep, Whose pulse beats ever, whose attainment is But as a step to better in the sphere Of knowledge; hath much travelled since that day, Still leaving ruin in the rear and sure Oblivion even to the holy things; For holier because juster rise before him. But while I gaze on these god-worthy forms, Fragments of wonder-working art, whose realm Is bounded by the sense and wanders not, The ancient gods become realities, The veil of time is drawn aside again, Nature and high philosophy have met, Have been in mystical embrace united, The Real and the Ideal blentâ I faint Into a willing vision. O'er the fields Of Enna strewn with flowers ProserpinÃ¨ Would fain have gathered, but that Pluto's haste Bore her away unto her iron throne. And lo! the weeping mother, with bare feet And thickly-folded vest now seems to pass, In her raised hand a white torch seems to burn, And on her cheek a tear doth seem to fall Yet falls not, an eternal thing, a dream, A fable; are we not all searchers, still Losing and seeking. And in dread repose The sisters three, the everlasting thread Weave, everlasting and yet mortal, since Death is but re-birth, and the family Of man encreasing, knows no death. The steeds Of the sun-god from out the wavy plain Erect their glorious heads, the god's large arms Rise over, ruling them with power divine. All these, fragmental and time-worn are here, Time-worn and headless, yet no less supreme, Approaching even to realize the Will Of Nature, . . . to produce an archetype! Aha! I am awake: the shuffling feet Of idle crowds sight-seeing in mine ears, Surmising and admiring! I could hide My face within my hands, and as a child Weeps when his card-built palaces have fallen, Because he knows he cannot build in power, So could I weep in presence of these forms; I am a child amidst a world of gods! The angels on the plain of Bethlehem Have sung good will to man and peace with heaven Since the great sculptor and the faith he served Were among living things. The arms of Rome Have been put forth insatiate, on all lands Glittering in brass and plunder, and again Have they shrunk in, rebuked by death. The tribes Of the dark North have crossed the Danube's waves Ice-bound. The Cross has triumphed over all! The bold discoverer a new world has found, England has spread itself from zone to zone, Time hath grown rich with good gifts manifold, And analytic souls from year to year, Torture new sciences to serve like slaves, 'Till now we live in light, and though each torch Is rank and earthly, let us not deny The mighty Hope that every coming age Essays to realize. But through all change, The harmonies of nature must remain, The voice of these remain,â A revelation of the perfect man As at the first he was, and at the last He may be: as he must be in the spirit, If our Humanity hath aught divine, And to himself and to his fellow men He would unfold it in its purity! DEATH. I am the one whose thought Is as the deed; I have no brother, and No father; years Have never seen my power begin. A chain Doth bind all things to me. In my hand, man,â Infinite thinker,âvanishes as doth The worm that he creates, as doth the moth That it creates, as doth the limb minute That stirs upon that moth. My being is Inborn with all things, and With all things doth expand. But fear me not; I am The hoary dust, the shut ear, the profound, The deep of night, When Nature's universal heart doth cease To beat; communicating nothing; dark And tongueless, negative of all things. Yet Fear me not, man; I am the blood that flows Within thee,âI am change; and it is I Creates a joy within thee, when thou feel'st Manhood and new untried superior powers Rising before thee: I it is can make Old things give place To thy free race. All things are born for me. His father and his mother,âyet man hates Me foolishly. An easy spirit and a free lives on, But he who fears the ice doth stumble. Walk Straight onward peacefully,âI am a friend Will pass thee graciously: but grudge and weep And cark,âI'll be a cold chain round thy neck Into the grave, each day a link drawn in, Untill thy face shall be upon the turf, And the hair from thy crown Be blown like thistle-down. POEMS OCCASIONALLY ADDRESSED TO âMIGNON.â I.A DREAM OF LOVE. I had a dream more pleasant than the truth, And pliant as 'twas pleasant,âmust it be Only a dream? A fancy that hath wreathed A sunproof arbour round the sweltering browâ Causing joy-flowers to bloom, and corbie care To spread her wings; up-clambering round the heart As a child rosy-faced with ignorant wiles, Climbing a grey-beard's knees, doth make him laugh With its innocuous mirth, although enforced By plucking his frosted hairs:âcan it be nought But fancy? This it was. As through the street, Where drays were jostling and the coachman's lash Rang o'er the necks of his thin-haunched beasts, I had on errand of importunate haste Passed, till in weariness I slackened pace, To mitigate the unseemly dusty heat, By lingering within shadow a short while. People in long tides passed me, and some looked An instant vacantly, still hastening on, Hurrying somewhere with a tedious thrift; Unto the mart or workshop, desk or ship, The church, the tavern, or the mall. There was obstruction in their eyes, not death, But an obstruction of the inmost soul: They lived, yet lived not. Had I spoke to them What then I felt, they would have thought me mad, And each in his own sanity rejoiced! Anon a little boy came sauntering by, Whistling a merry air, that, arrow-like, Went through my memory, and a fair Dear one Drew me with gentle hand into the haze Of dream. A strange transition, yet not strange, If all the links that brought her image near Were marked; nor strange, since memories are involved Together by the laws of harmonies. I left the obdurate noise. Through paths of sward, Where never cloud of dust had fallen, I reached An opening in a wall of sapling boughs, I entered, and within more still and cool It was, and freshness through the air exhaled From the green ground. Half dusk it was, for round And round the branches wove a screen from heaven Of darkest green and varied leaf, 'neath which Flies thickly humming danced. Sometimes a bird Flew quickly through, and as its wing might brush The leaves about your head, it seemed to fear That it had missed its way. Flowers too were there, Sprinkled about amidst the grass which grows Hair-like and thin beneath the shade; bluebells Tinkling to the small breeze a bee might cause And violets, and poppies red and rough In stem. I passed still deeper through the wood By this cool path: a wood more kindly cool, Or harmless of dank poisons or vile beasts That creep there cannot be, and yet so wild And uncouth. Bushes of dusk fruit beside The pathway from the ground piled up two walls Of leaves and berries, from which flocked the birds As I passed on, or lingered with dyed hands Plucking them listless, and with profuse waste Pressing their juice out. Other trees were there Blossoming for a later month. And now, As if from the champaign land afar, came sounds Of hearty laughter, mellowed by the air, Until it scarce was audible; and song, Like a reaper's song, a very pleasant sound, Betokening a clear breast, and heard beneath A clear sky chequered by thick boughs, a sound Right happy. So I also sang. The sun Now found an opening through the stems, to fall Upon my path; and as I walked, across The flowers upon my right my shadow passed. A butterfly with purple-velvet wings, Invested with two lines of dusky gold And spotted with red spots, upon these flowers Was feeding, and anon as my shadow fell Upon it, it flew up and went before, Lighting again until I passed: and so Continued it. The space more closed and closed Became, and all between the trees were warped Vine-twigs, and plants more fair than vines. Beneath A slow stream likewise glent, and secretly Fed spreading water-lilies, and long reeds Heavy with seed, which might have made fair pipes, Cut nicely by the joints, from whence a leaf Depended. But I thought not of the task, Watching my guide's dark wings, until the path Seemed stayed by dense convolvolus and thorns (Largely o'ergrown without the pruner's hands) Of the red-hearted rose. But the dark fly lowered Its flight till nigh the ground, and passed into The mass of greenery by an interspace Which I had seen not: with my hands I raised, And parted with my head, full lazily, The luscious screen at this same interspace. Behold! beneath a peristyle I stand Of short columnar palms, before me steps Of thickest grass descend unto a space Smooth tapestried, with living garlands bound, And set about with moss-cushioned seats of wood Cut roughly from the forest, over which Uptangling richly to the highest trees, And waving even then into the air, Flowers rare and unknown, and around a fount (Of which a marble girl, with green feet through The water and white head, seemed Nymph) bright heaps Of lily blooms were strewn. But all these sweets Were nothing to the influence which came o'er My being from some unseen power, whose grace The whole seemed imitative of, whose smile The light seemed intimating to the flowers, Whose goodness all around seemed fashioned by. Half slumbering as I stretched upon the sward, Mazed by this unknown beauty, and the swarms Of flies like that which here had guided me All round, the influence became more dear, More fixed, and I beheld a Lady. Round Her hand, which held some sweet, the insects thronged, And lighted on her hair. I did not start With rapture nor surprise, nor did I deem Myself unworthy of this gardened love, This goddess-girl, nor said she aught to me, But by her eyes, which never looked on me, I said she was the spirit of my life, And tho' I had not seen her until now I still had known her. She bent down beside The sward I pressed; she leant on the rude seat Over me, but I knew not from that hour, Whether it was myself I gazed upon; Or whether I beheld with intense love And sympathy some higher beings, both Worthy of each. And she began to sing; A language which was song was hers,âshe sang; A fragile lute upon her knees she placed, And balanced from her neck by a silken cord, Her fingers gave it speech, yet touched it not, But her hands hovered o'er it like two birds With wings still fluttering to descend,âshe played. Soft as the fine tints of a rainbow bound About an evening shower, her music first Came on my sense scarce audible, like rain; Then, waxing louder, it ascended heaven With all its colours brightening. My heart It stilled to sleep, as a sister stills a child That murmurs not, but smiling upwards on The watching eye, to rest unconsciously Sinks pleased. But changing suddenly, the notes Began to whirl together as a flight Of swallows, and then louder still became Happy beyond all words, fair spirits seemed Clamorous and clapping of their hands for joy! Too happy beyond words, I would have wept Had I been in the actual world, where tears Are bred by intense sympathy, but here, Where sympathy was life, I did not weep. âOh Lady, thou art beautiful: and now The dark hair of thy song doth shade its eyes, The eye-lid of thy music droops: it plains Slowly and saturated with sweet pain, Carries my soul into a sphered realm Of everlasting melancholy. Maid! Who mournest for thy lover, hear the lay And be not comforted, but mourn no more As you have mourned. Youth! whose thirsting love Has conjured an ideal from the land Of Vision, listen with a joyous hope And mourn not with the bitterness that thou Hast mourned. A louder chord is struck! let grief at once Be wept out like a thunder-rain, and pride Go up triumphant with a purple flush And warn of trumpâthe golden crown doth press The spirit's forehead who hath conquered all!â âOh Lady, thou art wondrous fair and good! The earth is filled, oh! filled with gracious things! Slowly again to life descends thy strain, An odour as of rose-leaves seems to fall Upon me, and a pearly light: again It scales the are of higher heaven, alas! Art thou not over me as is a God, Oh Lady, with thy lute? and I will faint Utterly into death: oh intermit The binding of thy linked power, oh cease, And let me drink a silence short and deep, Then die into the Life that thou dost live. II.A WATCHMAN-SONG. 1. WATCHMAN. The night is dark, the wall is black, And the fosse beneath likewise; Johannes on the high tower sleeps, His hound beside him lies. KNIGHT. Fair lady, scarce now one short hour Is wanting ere the morn, And yet I have not dared to say What this heart long hath borne Still waiting and waiting for this sweet time, This rare brief happiness, To see thee o'er me, to hear thee speak, Thy hand at least to kiss. LADY. I know what thou wouldst say, fair sir, I know what thou wouldst hear, Though better that it be not said,â A dream, a trance, a tear. Oft have I sat lone days and nights And trembled at the past, And sure, fair sir, 'twere better far This tryste should be our last. 2 WATCHMAN. The breeze awakens and the clouds Scatter dimly overhead, Trees, and streams and paths appear; Thy spell, sir knight is sped. KNIGHT. Watchman I would tarry until The kindly brightening east Shows me once more the face that lights The shrine whereof I'm priest. Lady, it may be Lent again Or ever our voices meet, Ere I may hold thy hand as now Through thy little bower window, sweet! LADY. Good sir, the daily even-song Shall bear me back to thee, While each adventuring helm shall seem To speak brave thoughts to me. Another year shall pass as doth A silent summer's day; The sun goeth slowly over heaven, But endeth cheerfully. 3 WATCHMAN. The leaves about the rook's nest stir, The mist stirs on the fen Sir Knight, leap down, if thou would'st pass Unhunted through the glen. KNIGHT. Fair lady, leave me not so soon, And warder, why that fear, Lady, beyond the seas and hills My home hath little cheer, It waits with chapel and tower and hall Vacant from year to year. LADY Farewell, farewell! if it could beâ Alas! what would I sayâ To-morrow at night return againâ Now haste thee, oh haste thee away. KNIGHT. Let me yet listen, she is gone, Then cold blank wall, farewell! At midnight againâ! but oh, blessed wall, Thou'lt never a secret tell? WATCHMAN. Johannes wakes, I hear his hound Shaking his collar. So! Step warily, hold fast my hand, Thank god he is safe below! And hark, the sun-rise bugle-horn, Ya tee-ra-lee, ya ho! III.LINES SENT WITH SPENCER'S âFAERY QUEEN.â Lady loved! I bring to thee Aladdin's cave in poesy: I bring to thee a wilderness Where swiftest faun-feet might confess That they had lost the path. In sooth It is as if we had lain down Tired with too much happiness; And underneath an old tree's frown, A druid of Pendragon's youth, Where sunshine could but dimly peer In the leafy quarter of the year, While heats and odours, songs and hum Of bees, the sense had overcome, And an enchanted sleep had borne Us far within the gates of morn, Where strangely-shapen mists and clouds Array themselves in motley crowds, And clothed in nameless glorious dies Hurry up into the skies So fast, so changeable, so high, Now a bannerol'd young chivalry, Or a dainty sheaf, so mild and meek, Of maidens âgirt in guiltless gowns,â Dragons dire, decievers sleek, Mighty walls round baseless towns, White christian myths, and satyrs red, Each leaping o'er the others head! The Faery Queen! ah, well-a-day, Fancy's self is but a fay, And great round men with pockets stored, Laugh at all that she can say: But she also hath her hoard, Wine of life, and stone of power, Bath of beauty, deathless flower, Cap invisible and purse Exhaustless, salve for the ancient curse. These are of the wonderous things Guarded by her servant-kings, Hived within her planet rings: 'Tis she anoints the lover's eye, She from the fine lip makes reply, And round even me When I think of thee, Lady loved, a starry woof She throws of texture sorrow-proof. Yet again, ah well-a-day! Fancy's but a tricksome fay, Her wing so swift to come, also Is certainly as swift to go! Nay, ah nay, Quoth little Love, with his great blue eye Archly smiling, surely nay! It is not so, For I can tie Her right wing, she no more shall fly! Lady-girl, Mignon, May! Another name,âTitania, Henceforth take, while I, thy knight, Offer upon bended knee This treasure-house of poesy, In rare blackletters all bedight, Captured on an old book-stall Guarded by a monster small, In a far place where you bend Towards the well at the world's end! A treasure-trove Worthy better poet's love! IV.RHYME TO THE DEPARTING YEAR. The air is populous with snow, Falling and flying, above and below: This waste of households is fast asleep, Nor any the old year's death-watch keep, As elsewhere I've seen when every man Saluted this hour with his bousing-can. The snow, how it flies! but it may not be I coldly part, old year, from thee, Without a short kind benedicite! It may not be that thou who art So different from thy ancestry, Shalt have no requiem ere we part. Perhaps when some slow coming year Now in the future, hath drawn near, I may rehearse these lines while sheâ You know whom now I meanâshe may Sit by me hand in hand, and they Shall carry us back through smiles and tears, Till all this present reappears, The fireside game, the endless talk; The high hope scorning storms and fears, Upbraiding time; this white muffled walk Again I'll tread, and see here and there Those lighted windows' christmas-glare, That unredeemed cad by the wet coach-stand, And the lamps obscure up the dreamy Strand! Glorious night! to be sure the sky Is falling, the winds chill,âwhat care I, With love for a cloak against destiny. Good passing year! you have not raised My stature, nor brought aught about For which I might be praised, Yet good old year, when I walk out I feel as if I was not quite The same as on last new-year's night. Not that I hold my head more high Or dare laugh at Fortune, certainly! Not that her buffets hit less fair, But wounds heal again, and I take no care; And surely her smiles now are far more bright, And sunshine of heart with its melody Floats before the murkiest sky. The stars too, when night slumber brings, If indeed these ten months past Sleep hath ever o'er me cast Her sceptre,âwhisper wondrous things. Yes! like a glorious long summer even, A deep, rich, wide, and sensuous heaven, Thou'st been. Thou shadow of a shade In the garments of our souls arrayed, We are thy slaves, the slaves of time, Runners by time's chariot dust With moan and prayer, or song and rhyme; Still thinking thus and thus we must Attain and triumph, but the lance Slips through our hands when we would strike, And something else, oh, all unlike Our hope is what we have attained, Given by the passing god, not gained By us. Then thanks for the crown, say I, The crown thou hast placed on my Psyche's head, Thanks for thy gifts, good destiny, Heart-gifts that in their first bold bloom Perennial, evermore shall shed Light and medicinal perfume. Then stoop to thy melodious bier, All folded white in the snow, old year! Hark, at once from left and right The steeple tongues salute the night, Cloudy voices east and west Pass wandering, each a funeral guest, Ah, now St. Paul's great angel flies, And like the shepherd of the skies, Drives them before him, he the last Falls over the horizon of the past: So is the old year knelled and blessed. VI.A COMPLIMENT TO MIGNON SINGING. âAnd must I leave thee, Paradise?â Eve with retreating footstep cries. While the armed Michael following, Hides it with his burning wing. Pretty enough, a pathetic air too, At least in its author's dainty view. âAnd must I leave thee Paradise?â You must indeed, the sword replies! But why my laughter-loving friend, Dost thou repeat her tortured lay, Not even an angel can descend To tear thee from thyself away! The sky above our heads can ne'er Of its sun-glories be bereft, And nevertheless an atmosphere For storms and thunder still be left. Heaven may lie beyond the skies, But where thou art is Paradise. FOURTEEN SONNETS. I.AMBITION. To rise up step by step from hall to dais; To take the best seat at the best repast, While adulating eyes are toward him cast By the upstanding hungry; to have praise From those he scorns: to see the base hand raise The limp hat to him as he hastens by Not deigning to return the courtesy; To ride while others tramp the miry ways. These are the honours of a hot-breathed world, These the civilian honours, these the prize In church or bar. Behold that wig deep-curled, Great prize of a long life's toil, and those eyes Below it like dead oysters:âshut thine own, And think of Christ or of the sky star-sown! II.TO DAVID SCOTT, ON PUBLISHING HIS âMEMOIR, ETC.â Brother of mine, the last of many, passed Into the shipless dark sea, where we all Must follow, as our days and hours are cast: I speak to thee, I touch the dreadful pall, To lay thine own bay leaves upon thy bier. It may be in the arcane truths of God, Thou still dost feel this touch, dost feel and hear, And recognizest still the cold green sod, Immensely far yet infinitely near! Thou who hast shown how much the stedfast soul Bears abnegation, how an ideal goal Robs life, how singleness of heart hopes long, And how by suffering sanctified, the song From the inner shrine becomes more wonderful and strong. V.ON READING HAYDON'S AUTOBIOGRAHY. The coarse-voiced peacock spreads his starry tail, And wheels about that all the world may see, Of all God's creatures, I am first, quoth he, Meanwhile the part that nature meant to vail Winks curiously beneath that radiant sail. Vanity must have her eclat, show Of clapping hands, boast of grand aims,âand so The blessed functions of the artist fail. Not thus the greatly gifted use their wealth! The good man gives nor usurous interest claims; The poet craved fit audience only; health Works without boasting; Shakspere turned again To the sunset in Stratford:âhere, in flames, The begging Art-apostle dies insane! VI.WORDSWORTH. ON READING THE MEMOIRS BY DR. C. WORDSWORTH. FIRST SONNET. Too much of âTours,â productive more or less; Too much of âNature,â meaning thereby hills, Trees, hedges, landscapes rich with woods and rills; Too little of the dark divine recess Beneath the white shirt,ânothing of the press Of our own age so full of glorious cares, And men that call, new lamps for old! good wares For potsherds given! in this book I confess. Yet through it evermore appears in sight A poet travelling homeward who was still A poet every day, with common tread Who walked on common shoes up Life's high hill Self-center'd, God-directed, till the light Of this world and the next met round his head. VII.WORDSWORTH. SECOND SONNET. Cumberland was the world to him and art Was landscape-gardening. Most sententiously A truism or a common-place could he Announce, and by his grave large voice impart Value thereto. Steered by the simplest heart 'Tis said he never doubted, but held on Bible o'erpowered: in these our days alone Of all sane men perhaps in learning's mart! But he of all men planned his life with care: Fast by the wells of sadness walked he on O'er fortunate meads with chilly flowers made fair, Till on his right hand and his left were won The waving wheatears of a just success; A man whose praise rejoice we to express! VIII.WORDSWORTH. THIRD SONNET. Each medal hath its reverse; every day Its cloud; each house its skeleton; so here, Sum up this philosophic poet's year, And we shall find within his mental way, Few threads of vital poet-wisdom stray. Instead; philanthrophy with hand withheld, A caution selfward turned, the muse compell'd To chew the cud, to sift the sand and clay Left by chance hill-winds, lest some grains of gold Without assiduous sieve might there be lost. A bald soul awkward with his lyre, both cold And over-anxious, find we to our cost: And this the moral of the whole; that man Is great who simply doth the best he can. IX.THE FIRE AT EVENING. To one who looks but seldom on the stars, Whose lode-star is a certain dear bright eye Kind fortune sent him; who not frequently Among the tarns and streams, the hills and scars Of nature uninformed with life would roam: To one who loves the haunts of men, there bound By chance and choice: here pitching still his home Where Art the most abides; to such a man The hearth is this world's centre, holy ground On which the daily sandals are untied: And in the caverned fire he learns to scan The day just past new picture-historied. Aye, ev'n all life restored and striven again, And a new sun-rise breaks o'er heart and brain! X.THE WIND IN THE CASEMENT: WRITTEN IN ILL HEALTH. Silence, oh North-East wind thy saddening cry, Silence, oh wind thine everlasting moan! Is the child Innocence all naked thrown Out on the freezing earth, is the great sky Now made of lead for ever, nor again May the heart cheer up nor sweet lips be curled? Silence oh deadly wind! most sure the rain That an indifferent and exacting world Showers on us, the cold blast that ever blows On one who wears no ermine, sings no song, And finds no holidays, are enough strong To give us daily aches and overthrows: But with thy ceaseless inorganic wail Like parting Providence,âwho would not fail? XII.TO THE MUSICIAN. (BEETHOVEN.) Music transcends conception; God in heaven Is the musician's father. Wond'rous child! Instinct above the intellect is given To him the wordless and unlearned: wild Fancies of heart are his realities, And over them as o'er firm ground he flies Towards absorption in the unknown skies Of spirit-land. Alas! within the maze Of the actual world, hills, cattle, ships, and town, Knowledge accumulative, mace and gown, Wealth, science, law, he like a blind man strays. Yet be thou proud, poor child! be not cast down, Men hear thee like the voice of the dead risen, And feel they are immortal, souls in prison! TEN SONNETS EMBODYING RELIGIOUS IDEAS. III.LIFE ITS OWN GUIDE. Sometimes we realize our fond desires, Nor seldom doth the strong man seize his prize; But ere we gain the Expectation dies, And the Attainment's no more like the hope Than are the ashes like the beacon fires That shed them. When the day of life first broke, How many starry crowns were in the skies! But soon we find the mid-day by surprize Hath come upon us, not a star remains, Not an aurora cloud: nor are we grieved: The man is still the same, with numerous gains: Patience, the Knowledge he is undeceived, Confident humbleness, more strong than fate:â Experience thrusts us on, yet shows us not the gate. IV.LIFE WITHOUT FAITH. Most fearfully and wondrously we're made; In fear and in the dark we strive to live By sight, and in new confidence arrayed Cry we to Nature, stay! to Fate, give, give! Still loitering towards to-morrow, when to-day Fails to bring forth from its too numerous toils And manifold emotions, those great spoils Wherewith to build a tower of strength and stay, Reaching to heaven. Alas, we only find To-morrow like to-day; the impending sky Silent and blue, silent and dark and high, The only changes, passing clouds and wind. And round about us, blackening upwards, slopes Accumulation vast of unproductive hopes! V.RESTORATION OF BELIEF. Follow me, Jesus said, and they uprose, Peter and Andrew rose and followed him, Followed him even to Heaven through death most grim, And through a long hard life without repose, Save in the grand ideal of its close. Take up your cross and follow me, he said, And the world answers yet through all her dead. And still would answer had we faith like those. Oh who will speak again such words of fire! With gladsome haste and with rejoicing souls How would men gird themselves for the emprize! Leaving their black boats by the dead lake's mire, Leaving their slimy nets by the cold shoals, Leaving their old oars, nor once turn their eyes. VI.ON THE AUTHORITY OF ANTIQUITY. Catholic Chapel, Christmas Day, 1850. Why should the past loom out so fair and grand, And the most ancient most demand our love? Oh that we could with even balance stand Between the past and future: like the dove We could between the wastes of clouds and waves Gather the olive leaves and turn again Unto the home assigned to him who saves The salt of this life. That supernal strain Which sounded when the green-leaved world was young, Sounds still when the great petals ruby red Expand, and still will sound, though still unsung By poet-sage in years to come: the dread Soul-giving voice of God that spoke of old, Speaks still, and he who hears is crowned with gold. VII.PEBBLES IN THE STREAM. HARMONY BETWEEN THE SOUL AND NATURE. Here on this little bridge in this warm day We rest us from our idle sauntering walk. Over our shadows its continuous talk The stream maintains, while now and then a stray Dry leaf may fall where the still waters play In endless eddies, through whose clear brown deep The gorgeous pebbles quiver in their sleep. The stream still hastes but cannot pass away. Could I but find the words that would reveal The unity in multiplicity, And the profound strange harmony I feel With those dead things, God's garments of to-day, The listener's soul with mine they would anneal, And make us one within eternity. IX.GOD AND THE SOUL. Life is self-centred, and the light within Shines out upon the spheres of other lives, Giving, receiving, into the deep hives Of spirit, sense transformed to thought, made thin, Essential, vital. So doth man outspin The beautiful, the good, the just, the grand, And all the kind affections round us stand Like children whose sweet laughter cannot sin. Life is self-centred, though revolving too In its thrice-glorious abysmal sphere, Spring blossoms, summer comes, fruits that ne'er grew Elsewhere in our inspired hearts appear: But who shall speak of that sole Sun, the True, Whose light sheds down the fervours of our Year? X.SPIRITUAL LIFE. Ought we to long for more than we possess? To seek for Babel's heights or Jacob's stair, For lotus food, elixir happiness, Or aught that may not flower in mortal air? Are they not all within us, towering there, Midway the valleys of the spiritual east, And every morning when we wake, behold, They shine out freshened by the dews: what priest Is like the Voice within us! what so old August and holy as the daily joy Whereby the heart beats. I can feel the fold Of wings that fan my face from all annoy, With each kind word flies up a milk white dove, Haloes of light expand around the brows we love! END.</field>
