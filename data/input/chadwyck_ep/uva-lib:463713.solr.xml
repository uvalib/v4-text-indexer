      <field name="fulltext">Vnto the sacred Virgin, diuine Mistres Elizabeth Sidney, sole daughter and heyre, to the euer admired Sir Phillip Sydney, Knight. To his deere Mistris, Mistris Elizabeth Sidney. All the worlds glorie, and the earths delight, Created for to teach Phylosophie, That ther's a greater Essence of more might Then Grandam Natures old-taught dietie, Looke on these lines, deere issues of a King, The Song of Songs, that lent inuention eies, VVhich great Iehouahs Querrister did sing, Vnto the Sphearie Organ of the skies: Learne not but learne by this celestiall bride, To entertaine espoused happines, Yet let thy Virgine-Taper euer bide Like mid-day Sunne to light true holines, For though the world, and all things fade away, Thy Vertues, and this Song shall nere decay. E. W. THE Poem of Poems. OR, SIONS MUSE The Argument of the whole Booke. In this Song, Salomon by most sweete and comfortable allegories and parables, describeth the perfit loue of Iesus Christ, the true Salomon and King of peace, and the faithfull soule or his Church, which he hath sanctified and appointed to bee his spouse, holie, chast and without reprehension. So that heere is declared the singular loue of the bridegrome toward the bride, and his great and excellent benefits wherewith hee doth enrich her of his pure bountie and grace without any of her deseruings. Also the earnest affection of the Church which is inflamed with the loue of Christ desiring to be more and more ioyned to him in loue, and not to be forsaken for any spot or blemish that is in her. ECLOGA PRIMA. Th'argument. Betweene Thaumastos and his loue darke louely talke doth passe, Shee of her home-begotten woes bemoanes the wronged case. Ecclesia, Thavmastos. Imprint vpon my lips pure liuorie The hony pleasure of thy mouthes deere kisse, For why thy loue, bounded in no degree, Exceedes the sence-inchaunting sugred blisse VVhich from the taste of wine attracted is. Like ayre-perfuming Odors is thy smell, And like rich Vnguents is thy glorious Name, Powred diuinely from a precious VVell, VVhence loe a brand of kind affection came, Kindling y? Virgins harts with thy loues flame. Drawe me (my deare) entice me with thine eie, Then shal my after flight Times flight ore-runne, And when the King in pompous royaltie, Shall mine afflictions fetters haue vndone, Inhousing in his Chamber my selfes sonne, Then shall my ioy in thee be compleat fram'd, And thine eternall happy-making loue, Then iuice of swelling grapes; or what is nam'd By sweeter stile; I will record aboue All reach; because the iust in thee doe moue. You Daughters of Ierusalem behold The sable tinckture of my spotted face, Yet note youths features in decaying old, For I am louelie, ritch in comelie grace, More the the twins which sprung fr? Kedar's race. Kedar the large desent of Ismaells line, From whom the tent-inclosd Arabians sprang; And of more beautie then the silken twine Of Salomons curtaine; when thereon doth hang Th'vnualued Iems of which all Syon rang. Disdaine me not because of blacke attaint, For why the scorching Sunne hath kist my brow, And with his eieballs, on my cheeks doth paint, What sinne-inflicting nature doth alow Through the corruption of her broken vow. Nor for my Brothers (deare in my pure sight) Th'vnkindest ofspring of my Mothers wombe Against me forst the hosts of wrath to fight, Making me keepe a forraine vine by dombe, Whilst I mine owne in lost regard intombe. O thou in whom my soules affections dwell, That canst recuer my fayrs disparagment, Vnuayle to me thy beeing; deare hart tell Both where thou feedst, &amp; when the morne is spent, In what calme noone-tide shade thy lims are pent. For why should I their foote-steps immitate Which turnes aside vnto thy neighbours flocks, Whom thou hast call'd to that diuine estate, And yet like long washt, sand-consuming Rocks, By theyr fond dreames thy grace in pryson locks. Thaumastos. Most excellent of all the femall lyne, O thou the fayrest womens onely fayre, If where I am thou knowst not, then declyne And by the mornings foot-steps which appeare, Trace forth my flocks, and figure theyr repayre; And by the Tents of those cælestiall Swayns Which vnto Edens pastours are thy guyde, Feede thy young Kyds; and on their flowrie playns Sport with thy lambkins, in the Sommers pryde, So shalt thou learne, and knowe where I abyde. I haue (my Loue) compard thine excellence, Vnto the manag'd troups of armed Steeds, Whose crests, the seate of glories residence Adorne great Pharo's Chariot; when with weeds Of pompe; they hale his watch to martiall deeds. Thy comly cheekes, the Iewels of my hart, Are ritch enchast with rare reflicting stone, And bout thy necke where Beautie learnt his Art, Hang lynke-vnyted chaines which all alone, Gyrdle thy beames from view of any one. T'is we (my deare) that of the purest gold, Tride in the flame from out th'Arabian mine, VVill make thee borders; doubled many fold, Imbosted, and intraild with curious twine, VVhich shall with siluer studs imbellisht shine. Ecclesia. Whilst in the concau'd pallace of my deare, My King, my Loue shall take desir'd repose, My Spyknards sacred fume shall then appeare, Imbalming all the places where hee goes, And by his sent my feruent loue disclose. My onely one, belou'd much more then most, Like sweetning Mirrh, the seasoner of smell, Such sacred sent thy sight in me doth boast, And thou my Loue in whom all loues I tell, Shalt twixt my Mayden breasts for euer dwell. My Loues-ioy is like Cipresse clustred fruite Planted amongst the vines of Engedi; At whose ritch bounds the Salt-seas humble suite, Implores with kinde imbracing feruensie, Respect of loue, in his loues extasie. Thaumastos. See, see, my Loue th'art faire, (ô fairest faire) Faire is my Loue, faire in my Loue is faire, The gentle Doues that wanton in the aire, And dallie in our breath-bequeathing spheare, VVithin thine eies their beauties doe appeare. Ecclesia. (Dearelie belou'd) double thou art as faire, And more then faire pleasure consorts with thee, Beautious pleasant; pleasant beautious deare, To this thou addest all eternitie; And euer greene our bridall bed shall bee. The stately beames of our fayre Cytadell, And costly coloms curiously wrought, Are all of Cedar, rich in praise and smell, And those faire walks th'inchanters of my thought, Shalbe of vened Firre, with endlesse title bought. ECLOGA SECVNDA. Th'argument. Vnder Thaumastos wings to rest Ecclesia goes; Shee vnto Doues; to Foxe deceit compared are her Foes. Ecclesia, Thavmastos. I am (my deere) the glorious bashfull Rose VVhich on y? sommer plaines of Sharon grow, Sharon the nurse of smells; foode to that nose That drawes his breath where her sweet Rosiats flow. I am that Rose, the pride of Libanon, Beautie of Gardens, splendour of the field, And I am that pale Lilly lookt vpon, VVhose virgin-colour'd purenes, pleasures yeeld. I am the Rose, the hie fields ornament, And Lillie-bloome, the Valleys blandishment. Thaumastos. As stainelesse growes the staining Lillies blaze Planted amongst the vndergrowing thorne, And as shee makes disliking like to gaze, Praising her beames, chiding where shee was borne, So mongst the maiden daughters of the world, Thornie infolders of the fairest raies, Such is my loue, so is thy beautie hurld Into mine eye; gracing dispraise with praise. As Lillies are with thornes inuironed, Such is my loue with maids ingirdeled. Ecclesia. As mongst the Forrests barraine shadowing trees, The comlie Aple-bearing stock erects His rich regard; beyond all meane degrees, Such is my deere mongst other mens defects. Vnder thy shadowing fruitfull armes I sat, Thether delight inticst my feruent zeale, And in my rest, thy fruite to wonder at, Vnto my mouth all honie-sweets reueale. Like th'apple tree in vvoods, such is my loue, Faire shade, sweet taste, all sweetnes farre aboue. Into his feast-house streaming purest VVine, Thither my King, my loue hath brought his deare, VVauing the Ensigne of his loue diuine, Ouer mine head; defending mee from feare. O staie me (loue) with flagons doe support mee, Raise my decline, sustaine my downe remoue, VVith taste of apples (deere hart) do comfort mee, For I am sick, ô sick of mightie loue. Vnder loues Canapee, brought to thy feasting blisse, Support and comfort me that loue-sick is. Vnder my head, (wearie for want of rest) My Loues left hand (ô sacred hand) doth lye; Soft Pyllow-lyke making my temples blest, Infusing slumber in my closing eye, And with his right hand learnt how to inlace, And make his Loue by his infoldings glad, Hee makes mee ritch with kyndest kinde imbrace, Such as the lyke no true loue euer had. Vpon his left my head takes her repose And with his right mee doth my Loue inclose. Thaumastos. Daughters of Iuda, Twinnes of Ierusalem, That with my Loue my fayrest one doe dwell, I charge you by the Hynds, and Roes, and them That grace our fields with beautie, or with smell, Not to styrre vp; or with confusions sound To breake the blessed slumber of my sweete, But let her rest, with choycest calmes be found, Vntill to wake hir pleasure thinks it meete. You Syons heyres doe not my Loue awake Vntill hir selfe, hir selfe from slumber take. Ecclesia. It is my best Beloueds voyce I heare, Harke how his words sweet Musicks notes resound, See where he comes, marke how he doth appeare, O how his words with rauishment confounds; See where he comes, and by the Mountayns leaps, By Mountayns leaps my iolly capring Loue, See where he skyps by hyls, and earthy heapes, Leaping, and skypping looke how my deare dooth moue, The voyce I heare issues fr? my Loues lip, VVhilst by the Mounts he leaps, and hils doth skip. Like a young Hart, or like a wing'd-foote Roe, Chasing vpon the Medowes and the plaines, Such is my wel-belou'd in selfe and shoe, Such like my deerest deere one aye remaines; See how hee stands vailed behind our wall, From opened casments darting his pure rais, And through the grats, and cranies made to thrall, His ovvne true splendour gloriouslie displais. My loue like Roes, &amp; Harts wal-clowded shines, And shoes from grats, and windowes him diuine. My soules ioy spake, thus spake his musick words, My loue, my faire one rise, deere come away, For see the stormie VVinter Spring affoords, Past is the frostie seasons stubborne sway, The showers of sinne in raine drops numberlesse, Is chaung'd, and altred in this blooming time, Fled is brem winters wrath held mercilesse, And budding fruite doth flower in our clime. Thus saith my sweet, VVinter doth Spring obay, Then rise my loue, my faire one come away. The earths faire Arras carpet wrought in flowers, Now comlie folds her cold drie carkasse in, Beautie now paints the face was marrd w? showers, And all the ayres sweet quirristers begin To chaunt their carrolling lays with hie regard, Euen from the tallest Cedars to the shrubs, Whilst in our land the Turtles voyce is hard, Tuning graue Anthems in y? lower woods. Earth boasts hir flowers, birds brag their singing time, And in our land the Turtles voice doth chime. The elder Fig-tree beares the younger figs, And Mother-like vnloades her wombe of fruite, So doth the Vines with broad leau'd winged twigs, Whose shadowing armes are rich in mens repute, Now with their smallest grapes, times yongest borne Clustred in bunches like a countlesse broode, Casts forth perfuming sauors, which adorne And odor all what euer neere them stoode. Old Figs beare yo?g, sweetnes in vines beare sway, Then rise my Loue, my faire one come away. My deerest Bird, my choycest sacred Doue, That now inhous'd, in hollow rocks appeares, From those darke clowdie places (sweet) remoue, And from the secrete corners of the stayres, Display thy comly sight within mine eye, VVarble thy voyce, (my choyce one) in mine eare, For all thy words are sweetest melodie, And thy well fauor'd sight is seemely cleare. My rock-pent Doue; showe me, &amp; let me heare, Thy voice, and sight, one sweet, the other fayre. My Loue the olde beguiling Foxes take, And all the younger Foxes sweete destroy, For they vpon our vines foule hauocke make, And those which haue yong grapes they will anoy; Myne is mine owne, my best belou'd is myne, His is hys owne, I and my selfe am hys, Amongst the white bloomd Lyllies in the pryme, There feeds the darling of my best harts blysse. The Foxes take which makes our vines to bleede Thou mine, I thine, thou dost on Lyllies feede. Vntill the earlie day breake from the skye, And chase the shaddowes with her brighter wings, Returne my best belou'd, and with me lye, Returne and be like wanton Roes that flings, Or like a young, and lustie stirring Hart, Scaling the hie deuided Mountaine tops Of Bether; which deepe Iordans waues doe part, VVashing his feete with Christall water drops. Returne my Loue till day-breake shaddowes kills, And be like Roes, or Harts on Bether hills. ECLOGA TERTIA. Th'argument. A neuer to be chang'd conioyne the Nymph seekes of her deere, And from the wildernes black walks, is brought to pathes most cleere. Ecclesia, Thavmastos. In coale-blacke night, the nurse and dam of woe, Within my bed, whence easefull rest should flow, Him mine inamourd soules delight I sought, But all in vaine my busie care did tend, For whom I sought I found not in the end, Such bootlesse labour in my search was wrought. By night I sought my soules Loue in my bed, But found him not; for hee away was fled. Then did I rise, for no repose could please, And search the Citty, Streets, and open wayes, All to finde out my soules long lacking blisse, Incessant suite, endles my quest remaynd, And of my Loues losse mightely complaynd, Yet found I not whom my desires did misse. I rose and sought the Citty, Streets, and wayes, But found not him whose Loue my soule obayes. The busie watchmen, hopes to my desire, (VVho round about our Cytties walkes retire) They in mine earnest seeking found me out; To whom I sayd (downe burdned with my wrong) Haue you not seene my soules Loue passe along, Nor through our streets, nor throgh our watchful scout. The cities watch in searching fo?d me there, To whom I sayd; saw you not my soules deare. Then passing by and looking vp and downe, Hauing new left the gardiants of our Towne, I found the onely one my soules Loue nurst; Fast hold I tooke, and left not him I sought, Tyll to my Mothers house I had him brought Into hir Chamber which conceiud me first. Passing the watch, I found and tooke my King, And him vnto my Mothers house did bring. You Mayden broode of fayre Ierusalem, By Roes and Hynds, choyce in the sight of men I charge, commaund, and by them all I bind you, Not with inkindled tumult to molest, Or breake my loue from his diuinest rest, Vntill his sacred pleasure be to mind you. By Roes, and Hynds, Iudeans I coniure That you my Loues awake doe not procuer. Thaumastos. VVhat sacred one is shee which doth adresse, And rise out of the vast shapt wildernesse Like smoakie pillasters to kisse the skie; Perfum'd with Mirrh burnt in the liquid flame, And Incense scattred sweetely in the same, VVith all the spice which Marchants vse to buie. VVhat's shee like smoake from deserts doth arise, Sweetned with Mirrh, Incense, and Marchants spice? Ecclesia. Behold my Loue thy glorious bed alone, VVhich Salomon erected for his owne, And builded for the last worlds memorie: Threescore strong men, about it armed stand, Most valiant held in Israells happie land, To shield it safe from priuate enemie. About thy bed due to King Salomons name, Stand threescore strong; vow'd to defend the same. They all haue skill in mannaging their swords, And expert are, in Warre, and warlike words, No one more seene in Martiall deedes then they: Each hath his sword vpon his manlie thigh, Fearing the nights sworne priuat enemie, So much in them, their carefull cares beare sway. All expert are in Warre, and manlie fight, Bearing their conqu'ring swords for feare by night. King Salomon, faire Sions blessed King, Of whom the Heauen-vnfoulding Bookes doe sing, Hee for himselfe a stately pallace fram'd Of costlie wood, and curious pleasing showe, Such as no after age shall euer knowe, From Lebanon the comelie trees were nam'd. Of those faire trees of fruitfull Lebanon, The King hath built him selfe a statelie throne Hee whose inuentions purenes cannot fade, Of polisht siluer hath his pillers made, The pauement gold, like an inchased Iem: The hangings purple, delicatly doone, Vpon whose midst the true Loues euer wonne, Of all the dames of great Ierusalem. Golde pau'd; with siluer pyllers raysd aboue; Purple the hangings, lin'd with Sions Loue. Come forth you daughters Iuda doth infold, And your great King, ritch Salomon behold, Crownd with that Diadem of sacred sway; VVherewith his Mother in his nuptiall feast, Adornd his shyning temples glorious crest, And in his harts tryumphant Holy day. Come Virgin-holy Mayds see Salomon crownd, Vpon that day when all his ioyes were found. ECLOGA QVARTA. Th'argument. Ecclesia, spotles in his eye Thaumastos much commends; And in the ardor of his zeale his Loue to hir commends. Thavmastos Ecclesia. My perfit loue, behold th'art perfit fayre, Fayre is my Loue, &amp; beautious is her face, And thy bright eies, pure chastities sole haire Are like to doues vnstained c?stant grace. O thou art fayre, fayre is my sacred Loue, And thy chast eye is lyke the chastest Doue. Amongst thy gold-dispierced comely locks, Thy tressed hayres delightfull memorie, Are like the Goates gath'red in goodly flocks, Which from the Mountaine Giliad casts their eye, Thy haires amongst their curles are like the flocke. which downwards casts their looks fr? Giliads rock. Thy milke-white teeth are like well orderd sheepe, Which beare their siluer fleeces from the brooke, Al bringing twins; twins brought they safely leepe, Whom barraines forsaking hath forsooke. Thy teeth like well washt sheepe in order stand, All twinning; and none barraine in our land. Thy lips are like the sweete dyed scarlet thryd And comlie is thy speech discouering talke, Thy blessed temples in thy locks are hid, Like a Pomegranat on his broad-leau'd stalke. Thy lyps like Scarlet, all thy talke is faire, Thy temples in thy locks Pomegranats were. Like Dauids statelie Tower, built for defence, Such is the towrie beautie of thy necke, A thousand shields therein keepes residence, And it the strong-mens Targets richly deck. Thy necke like Dauids tower when hung along, VVith thousand shields, and Targets of the strong. Thy two faire breasts, imboasted circular, The cabinets of knowledge, and pure zeale, As two young twinned Roes, such like they are, Feeding where sweetning Lillies sweetes reueale. Thy breasts are like two infant twinned Roes, Grassing where all the white-facst Lillies growes. Vntill the day-breake beautifie the morne, And black-facst shaddowes flie before the Sonne, Vnto the hils where sweet-breathd Mirh was borne, And to the Mounts of Incense will I runne To Mounts of Mirrh and Incense will I goe Till early daye blacke shaddowes ouerthrowe. All fayre in thee, thou in all fayre dost dwell My Loue, my deare, my onely soules delyght Purenes him selfe, cannot thy purenes tell, For thou art spotlesse, neuer-stayning whyte. VVith all eternall fayre my Loue is crownd, And no one spot about her can be found. My brydall spouse, my beds companion, From fruitfull Lebanon come walke with me, VVith me (my soules soule) come from Lebanon, VVhere growes rich Frankensence perfuming tree. VVith me come trace from hie-topt Lebanon, That all Arabias confines lookes vpon. And from the top of Amanah looke downe, From Shenir, and from Hermons holie hill, Euen from the dens where angrie Lions frowne, And from the Mounts which Leopards doe fill. From Amanah, Hermon, and Shenir see, From Lions dens, and where the Leopards bee. My Sister, spouse, and all what in me lies, VVounded thou hast, wounded thou hast my hart, First with a looke from one of thy faire eies, Then with thy necks chaine glorying that part. My Sister, spouse, by thee my harts wound came, Thy necks chaine cause, &amp; thine eies brighter flame. Howe faire my spouse and Sister is thy Loue, O how much better then delightful wine? And thy rare oyntments sauour I doe proue, VVhich from the tops of Lebanon doe goe. O garden fount; ô liuing waters well, O spring which on Mount Lebanon doth dwell. Arise ô North, and come ô South and blowe, That my faire gardens spice may issue out, And let my best Loue to his garden goe: To eate the fruite; pleasure impales about. Blow North, &amp; South, my gardens spice out cast, And let my Loue his fruits sweet pleasure tast. ECLOGA QVINTA. Th'argument. Thaumastos calls his Loue, and shee his voyce doth heare, Shee doth confesse her nakednes, and highlie lauds her deare. Thavmastos Ecclesia. Ivda. My Sister, and my beds companion, Into my garden am I com'd alone; My Mirrh I gathered with my other spice, (Perfuming planted in my Paradise) My Honie-combe I ate with Honnie spred, My wine I dranke with sweete milke mingled, Then ô my friends and consorts of my loue, Drinke, eate, and laugh, let solace onely moue. Ecclesia. Slumber impaleth all my weaker sence, But yet my hart keepes waking residence, The voyce which knocketh at my closd vp dore, Issues from him my greatest loues adore. Thaumastos. Open to me my Sister and my loue, My vndefiled faire-one, my harts Doue, For see my head with moistning dewe is spred, And all my locks with night-drops couered. Ecclesia. My weedes put of (deere) naked I remaine, How shall I then the same put on againe? My feete are bath'd, and washt from spotting sinne, Howe to defile them shall I then beginne? My well-beloueds sacred hand was put In by the dores hole when the same was shut, And in that motion was my secret hart. My inward bowels, and my priuat part, Moued, stir'd vp, and mightelie inflamed VVith loue to him, in whom my loue was framed. Then rose I vp to open (but too late) The long closd portall of my pallace gate, And rising dropped from my Iuorie hands, And from my fingers (once affections brands) Mirrh, and pure Mirrh, (no sweets more purer are) Vpon the sacred handles of the barre. Open I did vnto my Loue the dore, But hee was gone; past was my loue before, Gone was my hart and from my brest did breake, When first I heard my dearest true-loue speake, Long did I seeke but could not finde my friend, I cald but hee no aunswere backe would send. The Citties rounders, watchmen of our towne, They found me how I sought him vp, and downe, And finding me, with weapons of their scorne They smoat, and wounded me; my loues forlorne; And those which on our Citties walls did watch, They from my beautious face; my vaile did catch. O holie Daughters of Ierusalem, I charge and binde you by my true Loues Iem, That if you finde where my soules life doth moue, You tell him I am mightie sicke of Loue. Iuda. O femall excellence; ô beauties crowne VVhich art of womens faire, the faire renowne, VVhat is thy well-beloueds honour more, Then others well-beloueds knowne before? Or whereby doth thy loues loue growe so large, That thus thou bindst vs by this mightie charge? Ecclesia. Iuda, my best belou'd is Lillie white, Ruddie and pale; Vermilion siluer bright, Mongst thousands and ten thousands of the blest, Hee is the chiefest and the onelie best, His head as to fine gold, bright rays assume, His curled locks, blacke as the Rauens plume, His virgine eies are like the siluer Doues VVhich on the watrie Riuers sing their loues, Whilst washt within y? sweet milks pleasant streame, They by the full fild vessels doe remaine. His cheekes are as a bed of rarest spice, Or flowers sprung vp in heauens Paradise, And his deare lips like Lillies; ceaselesse power Of purest Mirrh, an euerlasting shower; His hands like rings of gold, whilst in them sit The neuer equald shining Chrissolit. His bellie like pure Iuorie burnished, With blew-veynd Saphirs richlie couered. His legges are pillers wrought in Marble mine, Grafted in golden sockets as diuine, As Lebanon such is his count'nance bent, And as the Cedars most, most excellent. His mouth as all the world of sweetnes is, And all in all he is delights best blisse. O Daughters of Ierusalem attend, This is my loue, my louer, and my friend. Iuda. Beautie of Beauties; excelling fairest one, O whether is thy best beloued gone, Whether is thy foules soueraigne turnd aside, VVhere doe his glories, and his triumphs bide? Tell vs that we may seeke him out with thee. Admird through heauen, and earths posteritie. ECLOGA SEXTA. Th'argument. Ecclesia in her soule assures, Thaumastos loue vnfaind, And mongst her praises doth display, her single selfe vnstaind. Ecclesia, Thavmastos. Gone to this worlds faire Eden is my loue, Vnto the beds of spices, and perfumes In y? choice gard? where delights doe moue, There will he banquet till the day c?sumes, Gath'ring pale Lillies to adorne his plumes. My true-loue to the gardens spice beds came, To feede and gather Lillies in the same. Exchanged I, to him, to mee my deere, Immortall intrest holds my loue in me, No lesse in him is my strong title cleere, Both hauing right of perpetuitie, VVhilst hee on Lillies feedes eternallie. I am his owne, he is my proper right, VVho feedes on Lillies-food both day &amp; night. Thaumastos. As Tirza, is my true loue beautifull; Tirza which borders chosen Israell, VVhom Euphrates within his armes doth cull, As bright Ierusalem her lookes excell, And as an ensignd Armie shee is fell. As Tirza or Ierusalem my starre, Is faire and sterne, as bannerd hosts in warre. Turne from mine eyes, the beautie of thine eyes, For their sun-darting splendours conquer mee, And as thy thralls, mine all affections lyes, The while thy net inclosing-tresses be, Like Mountaine Kyds, which to the Valleys see. Turne thy victorious eye away, thy locks Are like the down cast looks of hie climbd flocks. The Iuorie gardiants of thy blessed talke, Are like the double-bearing new washt sheepe, VVhose fruitful wombes, plenties wel loaden stalke Hath now intombd in the vnsearched deepe All the poore trophies barrennes did keepe. As barrenlesse washt sheepe are with their twinns, Such seeme thy teeths bright polisht garnishings. Thy statelie forehead clouded vnderneath The sumptuous curtaine of thy golden tresse, Resembles those Pomegranats which deceiue, The passenger; whose eie-sight connot gesse, Where hangs the fruit through leaf-dark wildernes. As great Pomegranats leauie shades alowe, So doe thy haires hoode-winke thy siluer bowe. Threescore annointed gorgeous Queenes there are, And fourescore wanton Concubins for loue, And of the Mayden Damsels whom compare Raiseth the greatest number far aboue, In countlesse infinets their armies moue. Queens threescore, fourscore Concubins remaine, And Damsels whom no number can containe. Yet is my loue alone vnequalled The onely stainlesse issue of her mother, Deerer to her then may be valued, Seene of those Maides, and praisd before all other, whose laude nor Queens nor c?cubins wil smother. My single loue, in whom all things are pleased, Of maids, of Queenes, &amp; concubins is praised. But speake all ages, tell mee who shee is, VVhich like the mornings glorie lookes abroad, Faire as the full Moone midst her starrie blisse, Pure as the Sunne in highest heauens aboade, And dreadfull as an Ensignd armies loade? VVhats shee lookes foorth, fairer then Moone or star, Bright like the Sun, fearefull as men of war? Ecclesia. Downe haue I gone into the nuttie walks, To viewe the vallyes riches, and her fruite, To see what buds sprang from the Vine trees stalks, Or if the braue Pomegranate with repute VVere ouer florisht with a flowric sute. Downe did I goe into the nuttie bower, To see the Vine buds, and Pomegranats flower. But when I came, nothing to me was knowne, Discording vnagreements raind therein, Then did my soule with wings that wel had flowne, Adresse me like the Charriots that within Swiftly to hale thy noble troupes begin. Nothing I knew, and my soule set me then, Like to the charriots of thy noble men. Returne, returne, ô Shulamit returne, That wee may see thy peace contayning bounds, VVhat shall you see in her but cause of mourne? VVho like an Armie pestreth all her grounds, Promising nothing but dead-killing wounds. Returne ô Shulamit, returne Ierusalem, Ha, shee is nothing but an hoast of men. ECLOGA SEPTIMA. Th'argument. Ecclesias naked linaments Iudeas praise displaies, Sealing th'assurance of the loue, that lasts all lasting dayes. Ivdea, Ecclesia. O Virgin, issue of a Princes bed, How beautifull and comly is thy pace? How glorious is thy feete with gilt shooes spred, Yeelding their measurd stepps vnmeasurd grace? Thy thighes faire motiue ioynts, by true blisse led, Are like rich Iewels on a virgins face. The happy worke of that thrise happy hand, VVhose cunning arte, doth arte fr? arte c?mand. Thy mountaine nauell, holie hill of peace, Is like a globie cup made Sphearie round, In which celestiall liquor doth increase. Thy belly as faire heapes of wheate abound, So is the rysing and the downe release, VVhilst pale-facst Lillies it impalleth round. Thy two deere brests, chast cabinets of power, Are like two Roes twinn'd in a happy hower. Thy towrie necke (bright throne of Iuorie) Lookes like the siluer coloms of the day, And like the Pooles in Heshbon is thine eye, VVhere liquid Christall sports with sunny play, Like those cleere Ponds of Heshbon, which doe lye And at Bath-rabims gate moyst tributs pay. As Lebanons hie turret is thy nose, Which wall'd Damascus for his obiect chose. Thy head vpon the pallace of thy necke, Is as the scarlet absolute for die, Thy bushy tresses which thy curles bedecke, Are like to purple; graue in euerie eie. The King the greatest great bowes at thy becke; Tyed in gold-chaines vnto thy companie. O how much faire art thou my honie Loue, VVhat pleasure in thy pleasures euer moue. Like mounting palme that springs in pressing down, Thy stature is; like clusters are thy breasts, Oft haue I saide I would with hie renowne, Climbe vp the palme trees flowrie topped crests; I said my hands should make her bowes my crown, VVhilst on thy teats time bunching grapes inuests. And that rare odour which thy nose expells, Shall better much the apples better smells. Thy mouths celestiall roofe, shrine of delight, Shall be like wine refiner of the wit, VVhose holy fume, flame like assends vpright, And in my best beloueds throne doth sit, Causing olde lips lockt vp by silence spight, To speake what speaking Angells might be fit. Wholie I am my holy loues for euer, VVhose chast desier from me remoueth neuer. Come, come my Loue, the best ioy of my minde, The onlie one is pleasing in mine eies, Let vs goe forth and frolike with the winde, Sport with the ayre, and wanton with the skies, Let vs ore view the fields, loue let vs finde, Whence all the meadowes beauties doe arise. Thence let vs pitch our happie tents and dwell, In Villages; contents true Citadall. Let vs rise vp more earlie then the day, Euen when the night shall giue the morning place, And viewe the vines that ouerspread our way, There let vs see the florishe of his grace; And whether his small buds their young graps pay, Or if Pomegranats pride, all prides deface. There will I giue, what no gift else can giue, My loue to thee; which loue shall euer liue. The Mandrags vapour odorifferus smells, The Hony nourishment of breathing sence, And in our gates, and Portals euer dwells, Euen in our Cloisters, and our house defence, All whatsoeuer sweetest sweetnes tells, VVithin the compasse of sweets residence. Both new and old, and all that pleasures steepe, For thee my loue eternallie I keepe. ECLOGA OCTAVA. Th'argument. Thaumastos must Ecclesia teach, whom he supports from fall, His feruent loue to her he tells, the Vine that beareth all. Ecclesia, Thavmastos. Ivdea. Oh that thou wert (ô holy happy prayer,) As is my brother chaynd by kind to mee, who hanging on my mothers brests, draws ayre Of liuing life, from that eternitie, Then in the plaines would I recouer thee, And see thee sport without vpon the greene, There would I kisse thine hand, thy cheek, thine eye, Thine euerie part where euery praise is seene, whilst none should scorne thy sweets, (fit soueraigne for a Queen.) Then would I leade thee by a golden twine, And bring thee to my Mothers dwelling place, There shalt thou teach me precepts most diuine, The learned Legends of eternall grace, And I will banquet, feast thee, and imbrace; Causing to bathe thy temples and thy tast, With spiced wine, the pride of pleasures race, And with newe iuice, from sweet Pomgranats cast, Thy left hand on my head, thy right about my wast. Thaumastos. I charge you Daughters of Ierusalem, Awake nor stirre my loue vntill shee please, Iuda. VVhat sacred Mayde, what holie Virgine Iem, Is this that from darke shades her eies doth raise? And on her loue her louelie armes displaies. Vnder an apple tree; I raisd thee downe, There where thy Mother, thy first date conceiues. Euen where she first attaind conceptions crowne, That bare, that bred, that brought, y? nurst thee in our Towne. Thaumastos. Set my loues seale, vpon thy tender hart, And there imprint the Image of my zeale, Or as a signet neuer vow'd to part, Vnto thine arme let mee for place appeale, For loue then death, doth greater strength reueale, And iealousie is fiercer then the graue, Her kindled brands doth fierie vigor steale. And those bright flames which from her being haue, Are vehement, raging mad, &amp; will no obiect saue. Eternall riuers quench not burning loue, Nor can the worlds floods drown long liu'd desire, Giue all the world, all what in it doth moue, Yet all conteind, abates not true loues fire. Ecclesia. One sister (loue) we haue which doth retire, Yet wants she brests to nourish hers withall, VVhat shal we do for her? let mee enquire? What shal I say? what scuse shal I let fall? VVhen others for our sisters loues shall loudlie call? Iudea. If shee be vvall-like, wee will build thereon A siluer pallace burnisht as the Sky, And if shee be doore-like, or portall strong, VVee'le lock her in on Cedar boords to lye. Ecclesia. I am a vvall built by eternitie, For see, my breasts are like two well fram'd towers, And I haue layne within my loues quick eye, Like one which in his sight finds peaceful flowers, To trim newe Eden vp, and other happy bowers. Thaumastos. A comlie Vine hath mightie Salomon, VVhich sundrie keepers watch with coy regard, It fruitfull spreading, growes in Baal-Hamon, VVho of the fruite will taste, brings for reward A thousand siluer peeces well prepard. Yet my faire Vineyard lies before my face, Thousands to thee ô Salomon, are shard, But vnto him which keeps my sacred place, Two h?dreth appertaine, reward of greater grace. O thou which in the garden dwelst for euer, Vnto thy voyce all thy familiars tend: Exhalt it then, let thy sweet tunes perseuer, Teach me to heare, which taught'st me to c?mend. Ecclesia. O my deere Loue, my soules desired frend, If thou depart, or lift away to flie, Be like to Roes, or lustie Harts that wend And play vpon the Mountaines cheerefully, Where spices grow, sweet fumes, &amp; al to please the eye. In summo felicitas. FINIS.</field>
