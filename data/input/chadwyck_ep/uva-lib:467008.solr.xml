      <field name="fulltext">TO JAMES BRADBURY, ESQ. THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED BY HIS FRIEND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. Voice of the human heart! Thou voice divine!— First-born of love and beauty—Poesy!— Once more I bend a votary at thy shrine; My wild-flower wreaths I dedicate to thee:— And all ungraced and simple as they be, Embalm their leaves and they shall ne'er decay; But live a token and a memory With those I love, when I am far away, And set—for ever set—my young life's fleeting day! BEAUTIES OF THE MIND. “Our senses, as our reason, are divine; But for the magic organ's powerful charm, Earth were a rude, uncolour'd chaos still.” Young. I Ray of the living God!—Ethereal Mind!— Immortal atom of the Deity!— Spirit, by whatsoever name defined, My young adoring lyre would sing of thee!— For thou art of the Great Sublimity, A portion and a sign;—the mighty seal Of an Almighty writer:—hence to be A glory round the throne where Angels kneel, Or festering in the woes which tongue may not reveal! II From the Creator thou creative art!— Inspiring knowledge is thy splendid dower!— The faculties which can alone impart Honour and truth and universal power:— The glorious gift that cheers the wildest hour, And elevates the heart beyond its sphere, To scenes where sorrow may no longer lower; To worlds where loftier destinies appear— Eternity their date!—not fading year by year! III Thou hast dominion over space and time! The treasures of all nations are thine own; Whate'er of vast—or noble—or sublime Lies stretch'd within the shadow of each zone, Is thine—imperishably thine—alone!— The destiny of worlds affects thee not;— Age may consume the monarch and his throne— Oblivion whelm the palace and the cot— But thou wilt yet survive when these are all forgot. IV Thine are the magic colours which delight The artist in his visionary mood!— Thou art the inspiration and the might— The deep enchantment of his solitude! What time nor breath—nor sounds of life intrude— Where Alps on Alps eternally seem piled— Then is thy best—thy holiest impulse wooed! Amid the grand—the wonderful—the wild— For ever have thy loftiest revelations smiled. V The fateful volume of the mighty past Opens before thee—and thy mother earth Reveals her ancient stores—the rich—the vast!— Treasured in secret from her very birth!— With annals of her guilt—remorse—and mirth— Her solemn catalogue of Sorrow's seeds— Her hoarded memories of departed worth— Her gory list of blind Ambition's deeds— And all the frightful acts at which the bosom bleeds. VI Thou art the strength of Freedom—and the light That animates the Patriot to declaim Against the venders of his Country's right, And stamp their deeds with everlasting shame! Upon thy pinions soars the Bard to fame, And emulates the grandeur of the sky!— His sole ambition to deserve a name Within his Island's records, pure and high; To win one fadeless wreath—then bless his lyre—and die! VII Oh, my own land!—my beautiful free land!— Soil of the gifted!—Mother of the brave!— I love the very shells that gem thy strand— I gaze with pride upon thy bounding wave!— Though o'er my head the thunder-storm may rave, Thus do I greet the elemental ire:— Rage on, and strike!—if thou can'st find a slave— A heart that doth not glow with freedom's fire,— Strike!—these are Albion's shores—we bend but to thy Sire! VIII The dust we tread is portion of the bold— The heroic ashes of the charnell'd dead— Whose arms were mighty in the days of old: Chivalrous days!—brave hearts!—for ever fled;— For this—for this their gallant bosoms bled; No selfish honour—but a Nation's gain!— That free might be the shrines—the homes we tread— Free,—free the mountain and the vernal plain— And shiver'd every link of Gaul's despotic chain. IX A glorious object breasts the stately main!— A winged wonder of the sunny air!— With loveliness to make a Seraph vain— With strength the furious elements to dare— To 'front the tempest in his treacherous lair, And dash the ruin, smiling, from her wings!— Oh, gaze upon her!—looks she not most fair Of all terrestrial, perishable things, Save only that which from the eternal Godhead springs. X Onward to distant climes—romantic lands— Where'er the glowing waves of ocean roll, The queenly Ship conveys her wide commands, From realm to realm—from pole to utmost pole!— Reckless of danger—vanquishing control— She rides the surges like a thing divine!— A living creature with a dauntless soul;— A form in which the finer powers combine:— And this—Majestic Mind—this noble work is thine! XI Far as existence glows, thy gifts are thrown Like stars around creation—thou dost raise Forth from the valley and the desert lone, Kingdoms whose stately beauty is the gaze And marvel of the world!—a theme of praise To after ages—and, for each, a name That while the last recording stone decays, Shall light the memory with as proud a flame As when supreme they stood—the idolized of fame. XII When at the Word, the earth from chaos rose, And Life's vast circle in His glory moved; For thee, sweet Woman, thy Creator chose What in his works his Wisdom most approved; To thee he gave the tenderness he loved,— The voice, melodious as the passing sigh Of harps, o'er which the summer winds have roved: The bloom of roses—and the azure eye— The lustre and the hue of his immortal sky. XIII The first and fondest—last and dearest power— The master-passion of the Mind, yet known, Is Love—deep love—the sole remaining flower Of all that bloomed in Paradise!—the lone Celestial bud, whose tender seeds were sown, Upon the desert and the mount sublime:— And if Affection could indeed atone For all that Madness lost us—sin and crime;— Our spirits might, perchance, forget that banished clime. XIV For, oh! the bliss to love, and to believe Ourselves beloved!—to linger o'er each dream Of happiness, we cannot choose but weave,— To breathe but only in the beauteous beam Of Love's fond, eloquent, delicious eyes!—to deem One form the paragon of earth!—Oh, fair As moonlight upon lilies of the stream!— Those water-jewels—delicate and rare— Those chaste and fitting wreaths for Beauty's raven hair. XV Where lives the power to touch—to soothe—to charm— To animate—depress—appal—inspire The human Mind!—its energies to warm With all a Hampden's patriotic fire?— To stir the bosom with unquench'd desire Of war's triumphant glory and renown?— Hark!—'tis the sound of clarions and the lyre— Banners are waving through the festal town— The Hero comes!—he comes with his victorious crown! XVI Feel ye it not?—'tis Music's matchless spell Thrilling from nerve to nerve—gushing the sight With tears of feeling indescribable,— With sensibility's refined delight!— List!—Hear ye through the still and lonely night The hymn of mournful voices swell afar, Solemn and low!—It is the burial rite— The requiem of the dead!—another star Hath sunk,—to show how frail, how insecure, we are! XVII And 'mid the shadowy forms of beauty fled, Pale Memory takes her seat, majestic, free;— Light of Reflection!—Mirror of the dead!— The Spirit of the Mind's eternity!— For what the past is to the Memory The future is to God!—Thou blessed dower, That can'st restore the loved—the lost—to me!— Thou dear delight of life's brief chequer'd hour!— Take—take to Heav'n the praise, which thus through thee I pour. XVIII What penetrates the mystery that lies, The splendid azure and the stars beyond— Explores the depths of the religious skies— Opens the vault, as with a Prophet's wand— What comprehends the ever-during bond— The imperishable law—the chain of might Which links each secret feeling—fast and fond— Connects the finite with the Infinite— Save thou—resplendent Mind—our Spirit's guide and light! XIX Thou art the temple of thy God!—the home Of sacred truth!—Religion's vital shrine!— How far—how wide soe'er beliefs may roam, Still thou'rt the glass that mirrors the divine!— The hope round which unsetting glories shine;— The seal of immortality:—the scroll On which is writ the everlasting line Of an Almighty love!—Death may control,— Destroy the outward form—but never reach the soul. XX I look upon the Past—into the gray And silent heart of Time—and I behold A City in its grandeur, like the day, Emerging from the East in lines of gold!— I look again—and what doth Time unfold?— A shapeless ruin—and a wasted crowd— The young—the ag'd—the beautiful—the bold;— All, by some strange o'erwhelming ill, seem bowed, And pale and wild rush on—and shriek and weep aloud. XXI All—all save one—and she bends by his side, Whose arms were first to clasp her with a love, Fond as a bridegroom's for his blushing bride— Strong as a parent's heart alone may prove! And she is there, beside him, like a dove Tending his drooping form with pitying care;— And oft her tearful eyes she lifts above,— And offers to her God a quiet prayer— With looks like angel's,—mild, and beautifully fair. XXII I look once more—'tis midnight—and the sound Of arms and revelry burst on mine ear!— Some sudden horror hath profaned the ground— Slaughter and wreck!—the shivered sword and spear! Oh, gentle Love!—so young, so true, so dear,— Could she not 'scape the Victor's wrath—for this Sought she her sire—while thousands fled in fear! To calm his anguish with a daughter's kiss; To tend his dying form—and soothe his soul to bliss. XXIII Alas! there is no chord of human life Whose natural tone breathes not of woe!—there seems Even in boyhood, when the world is rife With buds and birds—with flowers and sunny beams Along our being's course, where'er it streams, Some haunting fever of decay—some shade From whose destructive taint, no aid redeems! Woe, that it reached thy generous heart, sweet maid; Woe! that so white a breast should be so darkly laid! XXIV In that distracting—agonizing hour, Thou reap'dst the grief, which seem'd for ages sown; What then sustain'd and gave thy spirit power, To wrestle with the horrors round thee thrown?— It was the Mind—the god-like Mind—alone!— That rock of virtue 'mid a stormy sea;— That spell which lends to truth its noblest tone— Shatters the chain and sets the captive free;— And mitigates the throes even of Mortality. XXV Oh! thou mysterious and eternal Mind!— Haply I sing of thee but as a bird, Whose lonely notes float feebly on the wind, Passing away unnoticed or unheard:— But, oh! had I the energy of word— The eloquence to utter all I feel— The gift—the power to grasp Thought like a sword, And what I know as I could wish reveal;— My song should find a voice deep as the thunder's peal! XXVI Exquisite Spirit!—if thine aspect here Is so magnificent;—if on earth thou art Thus admirable:—in thy sainted sphere, What newer glories wilt thou not impart? What powers—what unknown faculties may dart Like sunlight through the heaven of thy mould!— What rich endowments into life may start!— What hidden splendours may'st thou not unfold,— Which earthly eyes ne'er view'd—which human tongue ne'er told. XXVII When Time stands mute before Eternity, And the god-gifted Mind, new filled with light From living fountains, glorified and free, Soars in transcendent majesty and might; An Angel in its first immortal flight!— Gazing upon the heaven of heavens, to find The bliss of wings!—the extacy of sight!— A glory amidst glories of its kind!— A disembodied Soul!—a recreated Mind!— XXVIII Then—and then only—may the clouds that hide The stars of inspiration burst away; Then may the gates of Knowledge open wide, And Genius find its own eternal ray:— Oh! for the coming of that future day!— The Spirit-light—the Intellectual dower— The melody of that undying lay— The bliss—the bloom of that Elysian bower— When Time shall breathe no more!—when Tombs have lost their power! LAYS, HISTORICAL AND ROMANTIC. NINEVEH. (From the celebrated Painting by Martin.) “The masters of the earth have died,— Their kingly strength is dust and air! Within their breasts of fire and pride, The worm has made its quiet lair. I feel the world is vanity, And take my lute and sing to thee!” Croly. I A deep and wild lament, As of a nation's woes; With the fearful clash of battle blent, And the shout of midnight foes: The burning flash of a mournful sky— And the startling thunder rolling by! II The city walls are red With the life-blood of the brave; Mothers behold the forms fall dead— They strive, in vain, to save! Sons rush amidst the ghastly strife, And die—to shield a parent's life! III Mourn Nineveh—thy halls, Thy palaces o'erthrown,— Thy gorgeous temples,—sculptured walls,— Thy towers of brass and stone!— Mourn for thy power and glory fled! Weep—'midst the ashes of thy dead! IV Still onward sweeps the foe, Through the dark and gory street, Like ocean's wild, tumultuous flow, When gathering tempests meet!— Fierce as an earthquake's rending birth, Unawed rebellion shakes the earth! V Grasp—grasp thy battle-blade! Dash forward to the fight! Summon thy spirit from the shade Of cowardice and night! Off, from thy breast that minion fling, And die—as thou hast lived—a king! VI Oh! for the swords of old, That gleamed on Ganges' shore! Oh! but for one of all the bold, Who fought and fell of yore! Still do they call thee to the van? Still stand'st thou here? thou less than man! VII Then yield thy sword to me! Ascend thy gilded grave! I die a freeman 'midst the free,— A brave man 'midst the brave! Go to thy women!—fitter far For thee, pale king!—than hosts of war! VIII Light ye sacrific fires? Proud priests, 'tis mockery all! Without the valour of our sires, How may their sons not fall! If ye have spells—bring here your best, And bid them warm a dastard's breast! IX Oh, Nineveh!—my own— My native city—weep!— Thou wilt become a name unknown Beyond the mighty deep!— A wreck upon a desert land— My own!—my beautiful!—my grand! EUDOCIA. “The passion of a Syrian youth completed the ruin of the exiles of Damascus. A nobleman of the city, of the name of Phocyas, was betrothed to a wealthy maiden; but her parents delayed the consummation of his nuptials, and their daughter was persuaded to escape with the man whom she had chosen. They corrupted the nightly watchmen of the gate Keisan: the lover, who led the way, was encompassed by a squadron of Arabs; but his exclamation in the Greek tongue—‘The bird is taken,’ admonished his mistress to hasten her return. In the presence of Caled, and of death, the unfortunate Phocyas professed his belief in Mahomet. When the city was taken, he flew to the monastery where Eudocia had taken refuge; but the Apostate was scorned!” Gibbon's Roman Empire. I Away!—Speak not to me of days Of hopes that erst have been; Speak not to me—nor mock my gaze With tears—as false as mean! I tell thee—but, oh! words are vain— Thou traitor to thy land—thou stain— Would I had never seen The hour which paralysed thy fame, And gave thee an Apostate's name! II Oh, hadst thou foremost led the fight, Where Syria's banners wave, In aid of thine own country's right, To perish—or to save! If thou hadst crushed the Moslem foe That dared to lay our altars low— True to the vow I gave, I would have loved thee to the last, But, go!—that hope is lost—is past! III Still stand'st thou here, with breast and brow Thus servilely arrayed;— Where is the light of honour now, The pride—thou once displayed: Thine eye is dim—thine arm is weak— The dastard's hue imbues thy cheek— Thou shameless Renegade! Speak'st thou of my recorded vow!— He was a Man I loved—not Thou! IV Go!—Scorned by all, thy monument Shall register thy shame; Thou delegate of evil—sent To scourge with sword and flame! False to thy God!—thy Country's woe!— Oh! grief, that I should ever know Thy miserable name! Would when this day arose, its gloom Had burst upon Eudocia's tomb! XERXES. “Yet still there whispers the small voice within, Heard thro' Gain's silence, and o'er Glory's din; Whatever creed be taught or land be trod, Man's conscience is the oracle of God!” Byron. I He looked upon the ocean bright— “A throne was erected for Xerxes upon an eminence; and there seeing all the sea crowded with his vessels, and the land covered with his troops, he at first felt a secret joy in surveying with his own eyes the vast extent of his power, and considered himself the most happy of mortals; but reflecting soon afterwards, that of so many thousands, in one hundred years' time there would not be one living soul remaining, his joy was turned into grief, and he could not forbear weeping at the instability of human things. Rollin. And, far as he could gaze, One glorious vision met his sight, Lit with triumphant rays!— His ships in thousands swept the wave, In thousands stood his warriors brave, Worthy a monarch's praise!— From east to west—o'er sea and land— Wav'd scarf and plume—flash'd spear and brand! II He turn'd—what to the monarch then Was splendidly reveal'd?— Rank upon rank—two million men Spread mountain, rock, and field: Amazing host!—before his eye They marched, array'd for victory!— To conquer—not to yield! Ambition fired his lofty soul— The world seem'd laid 'neath his control! III That vast and valiant multitude Own'd none save him their lord; Nations to him for safety sued, Thrones trembled at his word: He moved!—shook earth and boundless deep; He spoke!—and far as tempests sweep His mighty voice was heard!— He fought!—deep pestilence and blight Polluted long the field of fight. IV Yet now, while gathering far and wide, His legions shone to view; A breath of woe o'er vaunting pride, Its withering shadow threw: O power! where are thy glories now? Thy votaries own, with burning brow, They're fleeting, frail, and few; They find thy lustre, when most proud, Is but the gilding on a cloud. V In light of youth, eager to bleed For honours to be won; Or pride of age and martial deed, Victors of battles done; They throng'd around him, while one thought Into his brain like poison wrought, He strove, in vain, to shun; Like the destroyer's breath it came, With chain and rack—with steel and flame. VI 'Twas this—that in one hundred years, Which leave us like a dream, Recording but life's many tears— Lost youth nought may redeem: Not one of all the breathing host, That moment gladdening sea and coast, Which god-like then might seem, But would be mouldering in the grave With worms or monsters of the wave! VII And 'tis a thought the mind to sear In brightest days of life, To lay the hopes we hold most dear, Bare to the torturer's knife: It is a thought of bitter woe To find with all we love below Disease and death is rife! To see the beauteous forms we prize Fade day by day before our eyes! VIII The mighty monarch, in that hour Of pageantry, descried How transient was all human power, How weak all human pride; How poor the objects art may gild; The very rock on which we build Our fame—how false, when tried! His conscience, which so long had slept, Reprov'd him—and he wept!—he wept! THE FESTIVAL. (A Painting by Perigal.) It was a scene of beauty!—music, soft As fairy mandolins by moonlight lake Or river far remote, entranced the ear And modulated every voice to love! A thousand lamps sent forth their brilliant light O'er the proud carvings of the gorgeous halls; And roses sweet as from the royal groves Of scented Araby, like lovers' lips, Kissed the white marble of each sculptured vase: And splendid mirrors glittered with the crowd Of fairy shapes, like the clear heaven with stars! It was a scene of beauty!—Sorrow fled As in despair of moving hearts so light!— And Joy unbound her rich and odorous hair, Forming her floating robes of gossamer To graceful wings, and full of smiles tripped on. The night was redolent of loveliness! The sylphed forms of many a ladye bright, With snowy brow half shining 'neath her curls, Like moonlight from the raven clouds of eve! And eyes, whose passionate beauty filled the mind With voiceless adoration, glanced along! Who then might dream of change?—there came no voice To stir the bosom with the hymn of death; There flashed no sudden vision of the tomb; No faded leaf to mark the blight to come!— And yet, oh God!—how many a young light heart Since then hath beat its last—how many a lip Lies silent in the tomb—and the sweet eyes That were the planets of our happiness Are dark and closed for ever!—Two I knew, In all the dignity and strength of youth, Delighted actors in that gala hour, Who now within the church-yard moulder lone; Minute by minute, ghastly, dark and cold! Thus I look on thee, thou bright portraiture Of past magnificence, and from thy glow Of noble beauty teach my inmost soul A lesson and a moral, sad and true. THE TEMPLE OF VICTORY. “Spectandus in certamine martio, Devota morti pectora liberæ Quantis fatigaret ruinis; Indomitas prope qualis undas.” Horace. I The glorious spears of war, Gleam o'er the calm blue wave; Voices and lutes afar, Sing pæans to the brave: Cittern, and lyre, and trumpet-strain, Breathe of the red victorious plain! II Wreath, wreath the laurel crown; Swell forth the glad acclaim; Bid glory and renown Record each valiant name: The mighty ones who by your side, For Hellas fought!—for Hellas died! III Fill, fill the banquet board, Your standards wave on high, Chiefs of the shrine and sword!— Brothers of victory!— Bring forth the guerdon of your toil,— The gold, the captives, and the spoil. IV Brightly and fast the waves Bear on the warriors now; The tide in beauty laves, Each tall barque's silver prow: A myriad dashing oars sweep by, And shouts of conquest shake the sky! V Open your gates of brass, Ye temples!—and receive The brave whose deeds surpass What ages may achieve! Pour on the consecrated shrine, The offering bright of ruby wine. VI Upon your tablets trace In characters of light, Which time shall ne'er efface, The victors of the fight! Immortal be they on your page,— Stars—which may light an after age! VII O! beautiful thou art, Land of my sires!—to me Of heaven thou seem'st a part;— A charm—a mystery Broods o'er thy hills—thy pleasant bowers— Thy vine-clad plains—thy leaves and flowers. VIII Mother of heroes!—long May valour guard thy breast, Thou, terror of the strong! Thou, shield of the opprest!— Wither the tyrant's deadly hand, That would enchain my native land! IX Evan Evohe!—Hear!— Thy noble patriots come: They have brought golden cheer, Riches, and triumph home!— Sound, sound the tidings far and free,— Evan Evohe!—Victory! THE MISANTHROPE TO HIS SON. “Yet suffer not scowling Mistrust To make thee to the world unjust, And think the whole one blot; For some there are,—Alas, how few!— With souls to every virtue true:— Heaven cast with these thy lot!” W. JERDAN. I Thou leav'st me for the world—the false, the vain, The treacherous world;—Alas! too soon to know How bitter is the fruit thou wouldst obtain!— How mean the core of that vast gilded shew! How deep the arts there practised to beguile!— How black the purpose veil'd there 'neath a smile! II Spare not thy father—bid his aged eyes Turn to the grave, forgetting earthly love; Leave him—with not a hope beneath the skies, Save that swift death his sorrows may remove; Bid the last link of life be like the first; Go!—leave this bruised and aching heart to burst. III Clasp the alluring world to thy young breast; Believe it the great glory it appears; Though it brought daggers to thy father's rest— Though it brought poison to thy father's tears— Deem thou the world as noble as it seems, And wake to madness from thy splendid dreams. IV If Happiness on earth hath an abode, She dwells among the forest leaves and flowers; She speaks before the shrine of Nature's God; She smiles in beauty through the summer hours; Not in bright hall—nor crowded citadel— Not with the high nor wealthy may she dwell. V Not with the high,—even though all be won— They're fretted by the very toys they crave; Not with the wealthy,—for their souls are gone With their adventurous vessels o'er the wave; Not in the glittering dance,—there Envy sips The blushing rose from young and lovely lips. VI Return to our rude cave; still be thy hand My gentle guide through the tall ancient woods— The only lasting glory of the land, God's arm hath rear'd within his solitudes; Then perfect not the deed thou hast begun— Break not thy father's heart, my son!—my son! THE GIFT OF THE GENII. AN EASTERN LEGEND. —“In vain do men The Heavens of their fortune's fault accuse, Since they know best what is the best for them; For they to each such fortune do diffuse, As they do know each can most aptly use; For not that which men covet most is best, Nor that thing worst which men do most refuse; But fittest is, that all contented rest With what they hold; each has his fortune in his breast.” SPENSER. I The morn was in the eastern heavens glowing, And like the love-toned music of a dream Was heard the clear, cool stream, Beneath the odorous shade of cedars flowing; And richer than a myriad rainbows lay Flowers on the Monarch's way. II In sunny paths pavilions rose, inviting His dainty limbs to their delicious shade, Where fragrant couches, made Of costly silks and blossoms, more delighting Than ever fairy queen in slumber prest, Allured to balmy rest! III The palace walls in marble beauty shining, The ancient grandeur of the sculptur'd dome Seemed formed for regal home!— Around the columns roses grew entwining Their graceful leaves—and soft vermilion bloom— Their richness and perfume. IV And, oh! the walks—so wild, romantic, lonely,— They looked the work of some enchanter's hand, Who blessed the golden land With love, and happiness, and beauty only— Bidding the clouds and storms of heaven float To seas and shores remote. V Yes, here!—the King exclaimed, with nought appearing To mar the eager reign of youth and bliss; Oh! in a land like this, My soul might breathe—nor care, nor sorrow feeling!— Save for that sad and solemn whisper nigh, Which tells me—I must die! VI That spectre of the mind—that rock suspended As by a withering hair above my head To whelm me with the dead! 'Tis that dark dread alone, which never ended, Shrouds all my feelings in a deep despair, And haunts me every where. VII Fearless of death, how beautiful and holy My hours would glide in this ambrosial spot; With but, to share my lot, One precious, faithful girl, who loved me solely!— Oh! if there Genii be—as some declare— Hear ye!—and grant my prayer! VIII Red burned the sky—the blast, in passion sweeping The forest boughs, like war's artillery roared; Lightnings, for ages stored, Appeared in liquid flame the landscape steeping,— When forth the Genius of the wave and wood Before the Monarch stood. IX Pale as a distant cloud in moonlight sailing, Glimmer'd his awful figure o'er the plain, While, like an organ strain, Arose his voice in sweet and plaintive wailing; And in his cold and glittering hand of bone, A crystal mirror shone. THE GIFT. In the hall of the Genii your prayer has been granted And swift with this magical mirror I came. When that day shall arrive which is blest as you wanted, Break the Glass, and your hours will smile ever the same! Yet, beware that the time be not rashly selected, Or wild are the torments the Gift may create: Be all, but the day you deem happy, rejected! Choose, wisely, O Mortal! or dire is thy fate! X Bright as a golden shield the vault is gleaming— The land is wreathed in oriental bloom:— The terror and the gloom Are faded like a vision of our dreaming— Leaving one only record of the hour, The glass of magic power. XI Years have elapsed—and many a treasured token Lies buried with the heart that gave it birth— Yet lives the King on earth; And yet remains the magic glass unbroken. Alas! hath not one happy day smiled high Of all the years gone by? XII Not one!—Not one of all the thousands perished To use the splendid gift, and breathe in joy?— No!—each had some alloy!— And vain grew every hope his bosom cherished; There came no single day of all the past, He wished might ever last. XIII And now, within his regal chamber lying, In heavy pain the Monarch draws his breath; Feeling the hand of death, And trembling in the horrid fear of dying, He grasps the charmed mirror—ah!—'tis o'er!— Its fragments strew the floor! XIV Long, long, 'tis said, the wretched man lay groaning Under the curse of never-ending pain. And long—and long in vain— He wept and prayed—for his foul crime atoning!— But ages vanished ere the spell past by, And left the King to die. THE LAST LETTER. “And all my hours of brief delight Flew, like the speedy winds of night, Which soon shall veil their sullen flight Across my grave.” Strangford's Camoens. I They tell me, I am greatly changed, From that which I have been: So changed, it would have passed belief, Had they not known—not seen: They tell me, my once graceful form Is waning—pale and thin— Alas! these blighted looks scarce speak The deeper blight within! II They tell me in one little month, I seem to have lived years; My ringlets have the shade of age, My eyes are worn with tears: They say the beauteous cheek you praised, Now wears a deathly hue; And, oh! I feel within my breast, My heart is dying too! III I do not wish to send one pang Of sadness to thy soul; But there are feelings—deep and strong— We may not quite control: I do not—do I love reproach?— Oh! if—forgive—forgive— 'Tis woe to think of thee—and die! 'Tis worse than woe—to live! IV My sleep is wild and dark to me, My dreams are of the dead; I wake—and bless the light of day, Though day brings its own dread: The visions and the tongues of home, Haunt all my steps with pain; Till fire is in my aching sight— And madness in my brain! V This may not—will not—long endure; I know death's hour is nigh,— And, oh! 'tis all on earth I ask,— To see thee—ere I die! Is it too much for all my tears, For all my anguish past, To grant me this—my parting prayer— My last—my very last! HOPE. What is Hope?—The beauteous sun, Which colours all it shines upon; The beacon of life's dreary sea, The star of immortality!— Fountain of feelings young and warm; A day-beam bursting through the storm: A tone of melody, whose birth Is, oh!—too sweet—too pure for earth!— A blossom of that radiant tree Whose fruit the angels only see!— A beauty and a charm, whose power Is seen—enjoyed—confessed—each hour! A portion of that world to come, When earth and ocean meet the last o'erwhelming doom. THE LYRE. “There is a living spirit in the lyre.” Montgomery. I A sound came floating by, O'er the still beauty of the moonlight air; Soft as a spirit's sigh, Soothing the death-couch of the young and fair. II A sound came floating free, A wild, and low, and melancholy sound,— A wandering harmony, Haunting the slumber of the woods around. III “Whence art thou?”—murmur'd I— “Lone visitant of this deserted shrine,— Whence art thou?—speak, reply— Answer, thou voice, this troubled heart of mine!” IV “Ere yet the shadowy woods Waved their green honours to the breath of morn; Ere yet the solitudes Echoed the song of thunders—I was born! V My voice was known and heard, When paradise grew glorious with the light Of Angels!—and the Word Spake 'mid the stars of first created night! VI My voice was felt, when first The gathering murmur of the deluge woke!— When, like creation's burst, Proud forests fell—and giant mountains broke! VII Mine was the charm that thrilled Fair woman's breast with joys but found above; And, like a fountain, filled Her heart's pure shrine with softness, grace, and love! VIII Mine was the breath that drew The Patriot forth to guard his native shore; When lances wildly flew— And cities trembled to the cannons' roar! IX Upon my wings the prayer Of countless millions sought the Saviour's throne; My power is everywhere— In every heart—in every language known! X Still ask'st thou what am I?— Go, ask the Bard whose visions I inspire: And, oh!—he will reply, I am the Lyre!—the soul exalting Lyre!” MY OWN. “A solitary bliss thou ne'er couldst find, Thy joys with those thou lov'st are intertwin'd.” Hannah More. I My own—my own—oh! breathes there one To whom that simple word's not dear? Beats there a heart so drear and lone, That holds not some loved object near? Whose spirit like the arkless bird, From all companionship hath flown;— And finds no gladness in that word, My own!—my own! II Who dull to every finer tie, To every soft affection cold, Lives on in cheerless apathy, And in his very youth seems old! Though frequent cares my mind enthral, Could wealth, mere earthly wealth, atone For the sweet beings lost!—I call My own!—my own! III No!—Time may still but speed to show How false is Hope's delicious song, And many a sorrow I must know; But, oh!—sweet Heaven—may it be long Ere those I love from me are gone; And life a wilderness hath grown, And of earth's millions there is none, My own!—my own! THE CRIMINAL. “The weight of blood is on thy soul.” Campbell. I The dungeon walls were dark and high— The narrow pavement bare— No sunlight of the blessed sky, Might ever enter there: In all the melancholy weeks, The prisoner chained had lain, No breath of heaven had kissed his cheeks, Or cooled his fevered brain. II For him,—awake—asleep—there came No vision of sweet rest; Undying memory, like a flame, Burned in his guilty breast: Dark as the weary gloom around, His soul was dark within; For, oh!—he lived but in the sound Of shamelessness and sin! III His mother heard his final doom, With shrieks that thrilled through all; Could nothing save him from the tomb— Must he—oh God!—thus fall! The arrow pierced her aged head, With cold and deadly pain; She tottered senseless to her bed— And never rose again! IV His father spoke not—but the pale And quivering lip confest, The agonies which did assail His miserable breast: His eyes were closed,—as if the light Was loathsome to behold; But tears burst from the lids to sight— They could not be controled! V Fast flew the fatal hours,—he trod Life's very brink, alone; Yet had no hope—no fear—no God!— His heart was turned to stone: I saw him as he passed along, A branded death to die; Wild curses were upon his tongue— Despair, and blasphemy! VI If there be one these lines may teach A moral; not in vain Have I endeavoured thus to reach A more reflective strain: The picture is from life—each day As sad a tale records;— Virtue! may thy eternal ray Light all our deeds and words! ABDOULRAHMAN III. “Ce qu'on cherche pour être heureux est trop souvent précisément ce qui empêche de l'être.” Fenelon. I Around the sumptuous palace-hall “Three miles from Cordova, in honour of his favourite sultana, the third and greatest of the Abdoulrahmans constructed the city, palace, and gardens of Zebra. Twenty-five years, and above three millions sterling, were employed by the founder: his liberal taste invited the artists of Constantinople, the most skilful sculptors and architects of the age; and the buildings were sustained or adorned by twelve hundred columns of Spanish and African, of Greek and Italian marble. The hall of audience was encrusted with gold and pearls, and a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the curious and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds. In a lofty pavilion of the gardens, one of these basins or fountains, so delightful in a sultry climate, was replenished, not with water, but with the purest quicksilver. “Our imagination is dazzled by the splendid picture; and whatever may be the cool dictates of reason, there are few among us who would obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts and the cares of royalty. It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience of the same Abdoulrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps excited our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. ‘I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to be wanting to my felicity. In this situation I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot; they amount to fourteen:—O man! place not thy confidence in this present world.’” Gibbon. A thousand columns shone; The wealth of India graced each wall— Gold, pearl, and precious stone: The ceiling, through the gathering night, With all its rich array, Beamed forth a never-fading light, More glorious than the day! II The royal gardens flourished there, With noble fount and stream; Like some angelic vision rare— Some bright and beauteous dream! Flowers of the finest rainbow dyes, Lofty and graceful trees, Waved their green honours to the skies, Gave fragrance to the breeze. III Pavilions—beautiful as those Imagination views, When, half inclining to repose, We see whate'er we choose!— Statues of gold and pictures bright— Proud records of the dead— Burst on the pleased, yet dazzled sight, At every onward tread. IV Wealth, beauty, genius, grandeur, fame— Nature and art conspired, To honour Abdoulrahman's name With all kings have desired: His armies flushed with victory, And spoils of war returned; His navy o'er the waves swept free, And foreign thraldom spurned. V Fifty revolving summers viewed His sceptre rule the land; Nor had one tyrant deed imbrued In blood his regal hand: Yet though his soul with happiness, To human eye, seemed rife, But fourteen days of real bliss Crowned all his splendid life! VI Oh! frail and empty are thy schemes, Vain and ambitious man!— Thou ever wert a thing of dreams, Since first the world began!— Still earthly glories light thy soul, And fame's more transient breath, 'Till o'er thee churchyard-shadows roll, And thou art cold—with death! VII The record brief of human cares, And human pride and power, King Abdoulrahman's tomb still bears A lesson to this hour! “In fifty years, but fourteen days Of happiness were mine.” Oh, God! I turn on thee my gaze, Grant me thy peace divine! THE VILLAGE OF SCHEVENINGEN. “Still onward, onward, dark, and wide, Engulphs the land, the furious tide.” Croly. I A startling sound by night was heard From the Scheveningen coast; Like vultures in their clamorous flight, Or the trampling of a host. II It broke the sleepers' heavy rest, With harsh and threat'ning cry; Storm was upon the lonely sea! Storm on the midnight sky! III The slumberers started up from sleep, Like spectres from their graves; Then—burst a hundred voices forth— The waves!—the waves!—the waves! IV The strong-built dykes lay overthrown: And on their deadly way, Like lions, came the mighty seas, Impatient for their prey! V Like lions, came the mighty seas— Oh, vision of despair!— 'Mid ruins of their falling homes, The blackness of the air, VI Fathers beheld the hast'ning doom, With stern, delirious eye; Wildly they looked around for help,— No help, alas! was nigh. VII Mothers stood trembling with their babes, Uttering complaints—in vain— No arm—but the Almighty arm— Might stem that dreadful main! VIII Jesu! it was a fearful hour! The elemental strife, Howling above the shrieks of death— The struggling groans for life! IX No mercy—no relapse—no hope— That night—the tempest-tost Saw their paternal homes engulphed— Lost!—oh, for ever lost! X Again the blessed morning light, In the far heavens shone; But where the pleasant village stood, Swept the dark floods alone! THE DAYS GONE BY. “Alas! the idols which our hopes set up, They are Chaldean ones, half gold, half clay.” L. E. L. I The days gone by,—'tis sad, yet sweet To list the strain of parted hours; To think of those we loved to meet When children, 'mid a thousand flowers! The scenes we roved—romantic—lone— Ere yet our hearts had learned to sigh— The dreams of glory once our own— In days gone by—in days gone by! II The days gone by—oh! is there not A charm—a feeling in those words— A music ne'er to be forgot— Struck from the memory's sweetest chords. With many a tone to wake a tear, And many a thought we fain would fly; Oh! still to every heart are dear The days gone by—the days gone by! III The days gone by—they have a spell To burst the cerements of the grave; And from oblivion's deepest cell, The forms we loved and lost—to save! Time may not fade those looks of light,— Still beauteous to the mental eye As the first hour they blest our sight, In days gone by—in days gone by! IV The days gone by—Man's best essay— One fadeless work to leave behind— Before their might hath passed away Like dust upon the desert wind: The very mountains have grown grey— And stars have vanished from the sky— The young—the fair—oh! where are they?— With days gone by—with days gone by! V The days gone by—from shore to shore Their ever lengthening shadows spread On—on—'till Time shall breathe no more— And Earth itself be with the dead: Each brief—unnoticed—minute bears The mandate of its God on high: And death and silence are the heirs Of days gone by—of days gone by! THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS. AN HISTORICAL BALLAD. “Jam nunc minaci murmure cornuum Perstringis aures; jam litui strepunt; Jam fulgor armorum fugaces Terret equos, equitumque vultus. Horace. I It was the Duke of Normandy Rode forth at break of day, With pennons curling on the breeze In bright and proud array: The flower of all the continent Composed his valiant train; The knights of Flanders and Poictou, Bologne, Orleans, and Maine. II It was at ancient Pevensey, On the noble Sussex coast, The bold Duke William landed With a fierce and warlike host, Of sixty thousand gallant men, With splendid arms supplied— Cross-bows and quivers at their back, And broad-swords by their side. III To win fair England's glorious crown, Duke William rode that morn, With battle-axe, and spear, and dart, With sounding drum and horn. Nor long nor weary was the way They marched ere fall of night, When by the brave King Harold led, Came the rival host in sight! IV Then spake the Duke of Normandy: “Speed, herald, bold and free, To the leader of yon martial host, This challenge bear from me— In single combat to decide Our stern and mortal feud; Thus blood of thousands may be spared If either falls subdued.” V One moment, in the monarch's sight The fearless herald stood, And gallantly the challenge gave To spare the waste of blood. Scarce breathed the word, ere on him lowered Full many a dark'ning glance— A hundred warriors struck the shield, And grasped the ponderous lance! VI Straight answer made the wrathful king: “Return thou to the duke; To meet his chivalrous desire Would rouse our chiefs' rebuke: Unto the God of Arms we leave The chances of the fight; And wear his brow the victory Whose sword is in the right!” VII With banquet-song, and revelry, Within the British tent, The hours from dusky evening To twilight dawn were spent. Not thus within the Norman camp— A different scene shone there— Hands clasped in deep solemnity, Knees lowly bent in prayer! VIII Ere yet the purple morning hour Illumined the eastern sky, The clash of arms rang merrily With the stirring battle-cry. A fatal shower of piercing steel From the Norman cross-bows flew, And many a valiant Kentishman On the stormy onset slew! IX But swift to closer fight they rushed, And brisker warmed the strife; And deadlier the contention grew,— Fiercer the thirst for life! Beneath the bold, adventurous duke, Three fiery steeds were slain!— His falchion waved the goriest, Upon that gory plain! X On spurred the Saxons to the charge, While axe and glaive swept far; And bravely smote they to the hilt, Like lions bred to war! Full to the centre of their square The Normans felt the shock; Yet stood they firm and stedfastly, As stands the giant rock! XI Like lightning through the element A trenchant arrow flashed, And into Harold's royal brain Through helm and temple dashed! He sank: yet to the death his voice Was heard in hoarse command; And fiercely grasped, his reeking blade Gleamed in his red right hand! XII Then joyous shouts of victory Far shook the circling air; And helms were doffed, and banners waved, And knees were bended there! With—Live, long live the Conqueror!— Did thousand voices ring: God save illustrious William, Our great, our glorious King! THE LAST REQUEST. “Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak Whispers the o'er fraught heart, and bids it break.” Shakespeare. I Come, while the clear stars shine, On cottage-home, and vine, While shadeless slumber wraps the heaven's blue height: And not a voice is heard, Save of some lonely bird, Warbling a low sweet welcome to the night. II Come, while the fond flowers sleep, In fragrance soft and deep, While like a quiet dream the waters move: And we will wander o'er The green fields, as of yore, Ere our young bosoms knew the pain of love! III Come, in this hour of rest,— It is my last request; For, ah!—too well I feel my coming doom!— Not long this frame may bear Its passion and despair; Not long remain, thus blighted!—from the tomb. IV My tears, perchance, may tell, How wild is that “farewell,” Which withers earthly hope within my heart; But, oh! thou may'st not fear, From one who loves thus dear, One word beyond those saddening words “we part!” V It must be weak—be vain, To wish to meet again, To roam once more the fields we oft have trod; My spirit seems to be But held to earth by thee,— But waiting this “farewell,” to meet its God! A FATHER'S REPROOF. “How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child.” I Come not to me!—thy words are vain, False as thy treacherous heart within; Come not to me!—'tis grief, 'tis pain, To listen to thy voice of sin! My pardon wouldst thou hope to win, Blot from my mind thy later years; I'm weak—despair hath worn me thin! I'm blind—my sight is lost with tears! II What wouldst thou say? An angel's tongue Could not excuse that guilty deed; Is not thy life one scene of wrong! Crime after crime, like waves, succeed! My heart, my aged heart, doth bleed, To name such infamy as thine: Begone! my spirit would be freed; Away! thou art no son of mine. III Alas! that I must bless the day On which thy virtuous mother died; She said her loss thou shouldst repay, Shouldst be my help, my joy, my pride! My help!—it made me poor to hide Thine earliest character from blame! My joy!—look! blindness hath replied: My pride!—what, thou!—oh shame! oh shame! IV Bend thy proud knees, and from the dust Call on thine injured God to hear; Forsake thy wretched haunts: be just, Ere shameful death end shame's career; Wring from those eyes of stone a tear, And may it be a star to save; But never more approach me near, Till I am dead, in my calm grave! A SINGLE HORN. I A single horn at the warder's gate Was sounding at eventide: Now who art thou, quoth the warder bold, Who so late and lone dost ride? Oh! an aged warrior-knight am I, From the distant battle-plain; Where the bravest troops of Normandy In their gory mail lie slain. II Now Heaven forefend, the warder said, That thy tale it true should be; Or that ever the Norman arms should yield To the Saxon chivalry! But hie thee within, thou aged man, And the cup we'll fill with wine; And thou of the good old wars shalt speak, That were fought in Palestine. III When the midnight hour was rung and past, From the warder's grated door A youthful knight with his lady bright Fast gallop'd o'er the moor! No aged man, but a courtly youth, To the gate so late did ride; And his love-won lives in his castle now, A fair and honoured bride! FIRST INQUIRIES. (Affectionately inscribed to Master William Agnew.) I Father, who made all the beautiful flowers, And the bright green shades of the summer bowers? Is it the warm beaming sun that brings The emerald leaves and the blossomings— Flowers to the field, and fruits to the tree? —Not the sun, my dear child, but one greater than he! II Father, whose hand formed the blue tinted sky, Its coloured clouds and its radiancy? What are those stars we view shining in air? What power ever keeps them suspended there? Was it man formed the skies and the glories we see? —Not man, my dear child, but one greater than he! III Father, from whence came our own lovely land, With its rivers and seas, and its mountains so grand; Its tall frowning rocks, and its shell-spangled shore? Were these not the works of some people of yore? Owe these not their birth to man's own good decree? —Not to man, my dear child, but one greater than he! IV From God came the trees, and the flowers, and the earth, To God do the mountains and seas owe their birth; His glory alone, love, created on high, The sun, moon, and stars, and the beautiful sky. It was He formed the land, and no people of yore: Bend thy knee, my sweet child, and that God now adore. TRUTH, YOUTH, AND AGE. TRUTH. What is Immortality? YOUTH. It is the glory of the mind, The deathless voice of ancient Time; The light of genius—pure—refined!— The monument of deeds sublime!— O'er the cold ashes of the dead It breathes a grandeur and a power, Which shine when countless years have fled, Magnificent as the first hour! TRUTH. What is Immortality? AGE. Ask it of the gloomy waves, Of the old forgotten graves, Whereof not one stone remains; Ask it of the ruined fanes, Temples that have passed away, Leaving not a wreck to say— Here an empire once hath stood! Ask it in thy solitude, Of thy solemn musing mind, And, too truly, wilt thou find Earthly immortality Is a splendid mockery! THE YOUNG COTTAGERS. “Years steal Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb; And life's enchanted cup but sparkles at the brim.” Byron. I. The blue streams know them—and the birds Have grown familiar to their voice; The echoes of the woods rejoice In the glad music of their words! Blithe creatures of the summer air, Companions of the flower and bee; Whose homeless feet find every where The free sweet rest of liberty: My weary spirit leaps to see, Their young forms in my wanderings; Lone seated by some ancient tree— Or brook that through the valley sings A pleasant melody! II. Their voice my heart to gladness stirs, Amid its utter loneliness; And half unconsciously I bless, The young, the mountain cottagers! True, they are poor—but He whose power Hath dressed the floweret of the vale, Will not forget them in that hour, The tempest-winds prevail! His eye—that rank nor wealth prefers; But on Earth's humblest children falls, Bright as though born in palace-halls— Will shield the mountain cottagers! COUNT JULIAN. “And she was lost—and yet I breathed,— But not the breath of human life: A serpent round my heart was wreathed, And stung my every thought to strife.” Byron. I The midnight lamps shone dim and low, “Rodrigue, le dernier des Rois Goths, souilla le trône par ses vices. Personne n' ignore l' histoire de la fille du Comte Julien, à qui Rodrigue, dit-on, fit violence. Ainsi les débauches des tyrans ont presque toujours été la cause ou le prétexte de leur ruine.” Florian, Précis historique sur les Maures. In the old Castilian hall, On the solemn couch of the shrouded dead— On the sable plume and pall: And mournfully a voice was heard, To wail the Spirit's flight; And pour its weight of sorrow forth Upon the lonely night! II “My daughter—my own beauteous one— My flower of love—that grew In brightness, like a forest-rose, 'Mid summer light and dew: Thine eyes—thy deep, blue, laughing eyes— Were like the rays of morn First sparkling in the dewy east O'er violets newly born! III Thy step—methinks I hear it now!— As light, and wild, and free, As when thou cam'st a little one, To climb thy father's knee: Or graceful as a fawn, just roused, Thou boundedst by my side; My friend and my companion— My blessing and my pride! IV And was it but to see thee thus I watched the early trace Of genius in thine ardent mind— And beauty in thy face: Was it for this,—'mid smiles and tears I blessed thy natal day; That thou might'st thus become, oh, shame!— A hated Despot's prey! V The sun of many years hath set On thy poor mother's grave;— Oh! did her spirit hear thy voice— Yet lack the power to save!— Heard she thy frantic shriek for aid Upon the midnight gloom; And was it not a spell to rend— To burst the marble tomb! VI Look on me, Heaven!—whilst here I kneel Beside the young—the dead, And cry for vengeance!—Be her death A curse upon his head! Ne'er may he know a quiet heart, A calm and painless rest; But be a father's agony Like mountains on his breast!” VII There are warlike spears and sabres bright, And many a martial strain,— For the forces of the Saracen Are 'midst the hills of Spain! And earth thrills 'neath the gathering tread, Of thrice twelve thousand feet; Where the rival armies pitch their tents, By the stream of Guadalete. VIII And Roderick—the King—rides there, On his triumphal car; In robes of pearl and silver dight, And glittering like a star: Oh! for the sword that gleam'd of old, In Alaric's mighty hand; How had he blushed to view thy cheek, Thou woman in command! IX 'Twas not the lightning crossed the path— It was the flash of arms— Hark to the onset cry!—what heart But to the battle warms!— Allah il Allah!—to the vault The Moslem shouts ascend,— And fast beneath the rushing steel The quailing Spaniards bend! X Allah il Allah!—Hark!—again That fierce tremendous strain: Yet through the storm one voice is heard,— “Where art thou—King of Spain— 'Tis vain to flee—thou shalt be found, Though at the festive board; A father's curse is on thy path— And vengeance on his sword!” XI And on he rode—and on he rode— A wild and desperate man— Until his foamy charger stood Where the Guadalquivir ran; And there he still'd his bursting heart, And bowed his weary head— For deep within the waters lay The King—the Monarch—dead! XII Eight hundred years had swept away, And a thousand hearts had wept The form in which Count Julian's oath Of vengeance had been kept! Eight hundred years had passed away, Ere the homes of Spain were freed From the evil and the woe which rose From Roderick's guilty deed. THE BILLET-DOUX. “For nought but love Can answer love, and render bliss secure.” Thomson. I May I not see thee, Genevieve, to-night? 'Tis sweet to wander when the summer moon O'er vale and river throws her clear, soft light, And star with star seems almost to commune; 'Tis joy to gaze upon that splendid sphere, When thou, my own dear Genevieve, art near. II Thou know'st thou art the sunlight of my thought, Fount of my memory—the hope, the pride, The essence of my being; earth holds nought Of hope or bliss but is to thee allied! Around thee floats an atmosphere of love, Wherein alone I speak, and think, and move! III Mountain and plain, the mild blue sky, the sea, The beautiful green leaves, the gorgeous flowers, Yield double interest when beheld with thee, Give thrice the pleasure in those happy hours We are together: feel'st thou thus, my sweet? Then once again, to-night, oh! let us meet! IV There are a host of melancholy fears Passing, like clouds, upon my heart and brain; And oft my aching eyes are filled with tears, Struck with forebodings I may not explain: My soul is lonely!—I implore—entreat— To-night—if but a moment—let us meet! GIVE ME THE NIGHT. I Give me the Night, love, the beautiful Night! When the stars in the heavens are glittering bright; When the flowers are asleep on their pillow of leaves, And no murmur is near, save the sigh the heart heaves: When the spirit of tenderness hallows each scene, And Memory turns fondly to days that have been, When the valley's sweet waters reflect the moonlight,— Oh! give me the Night, love, the beautiful Night! II Give me the Night, be it starless and long, When the gay hall is sounding with music and song,— When the genius of poetry breathes her deep power! And, oh! Love itself is more lovely that hour,— When the dark curls of beauty more gracefully shine, And the eyes bright by day are at evening divine!— When all is enchantment that blesses the sight;— Oh! give me the Night, love, the beautiful Night! THE VISIONARY. “But for those obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things, Fallings from us, vanishings; Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realized, High instincts, before which our mortal nature Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised! Wordsworth. I He had been superstitious from a child; Haunted by fancies strangely beautiful— Visions and thoughts magnificently wild— Rend'ring earth's splendours valueless and dull: The common air—sunless and vast and dim— Opened a sphere of loveliness to him! II A spiritual world!—of which the eyes Imaged no portion—oft and oft he sought By gazing on the glad green fields, the skies; To lose the phantasies his brain had wrought: Flashes of mind and madness!—but in vain— They lived—'till loftier influence burst the chain! III He loved—and, oh! what language may the truth, The full devotion of his soul impart? She was the melody of his lone youth!— The light—the poesy of his young heart!— The ring-dove of the birds—rose of the flowers— The music and the idol of his hours! IV Yet, to the gentle spirit of his love, The richness of his voice was all unknown; Perchance her lineage ranked high above, The fallen power and station of his own: And pride—for he had pride few might control— Kept all untold the passion of his soul! V A glance—a brief—a transient glance hath made His young lips tremble with unuttered bliss; She was the star 'neath whose pure light he strayed— And, oh! what light's so exquisite as this? His proudest aspirations after fame, Sprang from one hope—that she might breathe his name! VI And lives he now?—remains the lady yet The mirror of his musings?—and the light Of his lone life—or have they never met? Like streams that wander near but ne'er unite! Still breathes unknown the sweetness of his word, Or hath his long, deep love at last been heard? VII The moon is shining on the quiet leaves Of the dim cypress, whose low drooping head— (Like one who through the midnight bends and grieves!)— Shadows a tomb!—his tomb!—the young—the dead: The secret of his death, who may declare?— Enough to know—he perished—and sleeps there! HEARTSEASE. (From Mrs. Ward's Picture of a Girl with a wreath of Heartsease.) I “Flower!—bright flower!—beautiful flower!— Radiant gem of the summer hour!— Favourite sweet of the graceful and young— Honoured in painting, and loved in song!— Joy of the garden—delight of the vale— Woo'd by the sunlight—caressed by the gale— Dim is the spot where thy smile is unknown; Cold are the hearts thy enchantment disown.” II Heard is the lay which thy lips, maiden, breathe To the favourite flower of thine elegant wreath! Oh! long may the song of thy home be as gay; And Heartsease for ever bloom sweet on thy way! May no shade ever visit thine innocent brow; No blight pale the roses—so beautiful now. Still, still may thy form court as lightly the breeze— And the flower of thy bosom be ever Heartsease! THE LAND OF SPIRITS. “Desolate in each place of trust, Thy bright soul dimmed with care, To the land where is found no trace of dust, Oh! look thou there! M. J. Jewsbury. I Over the last long seas, That leave the level coast for evermore; Rolling for centuries On to the shadowy land—the spirits' shore! II The soul had gift—and power To travel swift as light;—for light it seemed— A beam—a starry flower From whence, like perfume, dazzling glory streamed! III On—with the waters on— The long, wide waters of eternity: Swift as a thought is gone— The ransomed soul sped on its mission free. IV Silent as were the waves— Whose swiftness gave no sound—no murmur back; As o'er a sea of graves, Wandered the spirit on its lonely track. V The azure breeze swept by— Hushed—as an apparition!—not a sound From farthest sea to sky, Woke the eternal sleep—the calm profound. VI The vault hung like a glass, In which we might behold the things to be— Where shapes of beauty pass Mirror'd in worlds of immortality! VII Oh! never since the Word Spake to the living floods, and said—“Be still!”— Had one low murmuring chord, Broke the divine commandment of HIS will. VIII 'Twas glorious when the first Pure spirit from the nearest heaven past,— And the white waters burst Full to the shore—the spirits' shore at last! IX 'Twas glorious when the stream Of silvery voices—like an unknown song Heard in some minstrel's dream— Came wasted with the sainted breeze along. X Distant, yet, oh! how clear— How exquisitely sweet—Earth's finest tone Were discord to the ear, When heard that burst of harmonies unknown! XI The splendour of the soul— The beauty born of God—what harp may tell? Angels know not the whole, Bright marvels of the sphere in which they dwell. XII As colours light the gem— Yet none perceive from whence their hues arise— So shone God's rays on them; Beautiful mysteries of the elder skies. XIII The eloquence of grace— A gladness beyond name—a dove-born air— Lighted each holy face, Each radiant feature of the spirit there. XIV The innocent spring flower, Blooming in whiteness near some moonlight brook, Undimmed by cloud or shower, May image best that purity of look. XV The land—the spirits' land— Earth hath its thousand shadows—heaven hath none— Why call “The Shadowy Band,” Spirits that visit the celestial throne? XVI All shroud, and shade, are rife Within the world of death—decay—and gloom: Here, reigns the light of life!— Eternal brightness, and immortal bloom! XVII The temples and the fanes, Built by archangel hands, fall not away!— On earth—oh! what remains Of all its pomp—its glory of a day? XVIII Build your proud arches high— Raise your bright domes—your architectural shrines— Behold—how low they lie! Can this be substance which thus soon declines? XIX Your monuments are dust— And your “Eternal City” reels and falls!— So ends all human trust, Though built by Kings on adamantine walls! XX The land—the spirits' land— There only may the heart in surety love; The beautiful—the grand Are emanations from a world above! XXI Were there a word could tell, A colour paint—a tone—a look convey The thoughts that in me dwell, Not unforgot this song should pass away! XXII But I return from things Beyond my nature's grasp—the quest of mind; And fold my spirit's wings, With a deep inward prayer—a will resign'd. WHEN EVE HATH CALL'D HER STARS. I When Eve hath call'd her stars to light, And the moon, like hope, shines clear, Oh! come in thy beauty to bless my sight, My first—my only dear! For ne'er had Love so sweet an hour, As that which the moonlight wreaths; When young hearts and lutes have the fondest power, And the spirit of gladness breathes! II There's a charm for some in the gay sunshine, In the golden lighted flowers, But night—oh, night! with its spell divine, Was made for hearts like ours! Then come when the last red ray departs From earth and heaven above, When each breeze hath a whisper of lovers' hearts,— My first—my only love! LIBERTY. “Oh! if there be, on this earthly sphere, A boon, an offering heaven holds dear, 'Tis the last libation liberty draws From the heart that bleeds and breaks in her cause!” Moore. Blest be the land, where'er it lies, 'Neath brilliant blue Arcadian skies; Or far in dreary solitude, 'Mid cataract and forest rude, It shores a desert sea: To me it shall be holy ground, If in its air there lives one sound, And that glad sound is Liberty! Dear Liberty!—thou ray of Heaven! Bright emanation from our God! Spirit, to whom a power is given Co-equal with the prophet's rod; Where'er! thou touchest—flows a stream Of grace and grandeur, brightening all! Beauty awakes as from a dream— Wealth hears, and straight obeys thy call! Brave are thy youths, and fair thy maids, The very soul of love pervades Their every word and sigh; Around thou turn'st thine eagle gaze, And tyrants wither in the blaze Of thine insulted eye! There is no attribute of mind No glow of faculties refined, No charm (that genius gave) But grows and strengthens in thy light: And lives there one such gifts to blight? Go!—cast the traitor from thy sight, To crawl an abject slave! Yes! by whatever ocean bound, That land to me is hallowed ground, If from its heart there springs one sound, The lofty sound of Liberty! CANZONET. I The flower thou lov'st—the flower thou lov'st— Oh! would I were that blesséd flower; To be with thee where'er thou rov'st, Thine own young breast my beauteous bower: To feel thy warm lips, soft and sweet, Breathe fondly o'er my crimson bloom: 'Twere bliss to die—if thus to meet So kind a death—so fair a tomb! II The flower thou lov'st—oh! 'twere indeed A fate of unalloyed delight; Thus on thy beauty's breath to feed, And gently fade in thy loved sight: For, oh! when every leaf was gone, That once thine eyes with light could fill; In spirit I would linger on, And float, in fragrance, round thee still. THE PEASANT'S SONG. I Oh, say not man's faith is a flower, love, That lives but a day, and is past; A star which gives light but an hour, love, A sky that is soon overcast: There may be such men, it is true, love, And ladies, perhaps, much the same; But these—are these like me and you, love? Oh, no! our love's more than a name. II I know that thy beauty may gain, love, The wealthiest lord of the isle; I know he hath sued, and in vain, love, To win the sweet bliss of thy smile. For me—that reward wilt thou keep, love, For me—to adore whilst I live!— When I think of thy truth, I could weep, love, To find I've so little to give! III Yet amidst splendid banquets and show, love, Gay dances with roses and light; Affection thou never couldst know, love, So fond as I plight thee to-night! The soul of a husband is lost, love, In pleasure's enchanting career; And, oh! thou might'st find to thy cost, love, That riches bring many a tear! IV My cottage, though small, is my own, love, 'Tis shaded by woodbine and tree; I wish, for thy sake, 'twere a throne, love, Oh, proudly I'd share it with thee!— 'Tis humble, yet not very poor, love, And wouldst thou but yield thy consent, Thou wilt feel—if thou lovest me—I'm sure, love, The gold of the earth—is content. REMINISCENCES. “That breathless agoniz'd suspense, From whose hot throb, whose deadly aching, The heart hath no relief but breaking!” Moore. I I know it is not beautiful! That in the vale below, Far gayer gifts of summer bloom, And brighter waters flow; I know it is not beautiful! But, oh! unto my heart, It breathes a charm of vanished days, No other scenes impart. II The days once eloquent with tones, They never more may bring, Sweet as e'er wooed a woman's lip To Love's delicious spring; Deep as the distant clarion's breath Upon the moonlight air, Inspiring high and glorious deeds, It were a pride to share! III The form whose beauty imaged forth The vision of my sleep, The painting of a youthful heart, Romantic, warm and deep; The voice—that music of my mind!— Are with the spells of yore, On which the morn may brightly rise, But never waken more! IV No gift of thine, love, meets my gaze— No token fond and fair— No, not—to soothe me in my tears— A single lock of hair;— Thou'st passed, my love, like some pale star We look in vain to find, Nor left to cheer my blighted path One lonely ray behind! V They tell me I am waning fast, That leaf by leaf I fade, They bear me forth with wreathed hair, In jewelled robes arrayed; They deem the festive dance may woo My memory from this spot, But, ah! amidst the courtly crowd, Thou art the least forgot. VI My eyes are wandering fast and far To other shores away, My soul is with thee in thy grave!— How can I then be gay?— I perish in their festive light— I die amidst their mirth— Oh! take me to thine arms, dear love, From this cold, cheerless earth! FOREST TREES. “There is a pleasure in the pathless woods.” Byron. Ye trees, ye forest trees, In beauty mantled by the touch of God— Ye hand-marks of his love—high monuments Of his eternal power—bulwarks of Time— Great archetypes of Nature's majesty!— That to the sun-smile of the summer, lift Your wreathed branches—green and beautiful, And strong, as when the living breath of God First brought you forth—ye trees—ye forest trees! Imagination spreads her hundred wings, From desert coast to alpine solitude, And fleet as light pursues her devious track; But whither may she speed and find Thee not, Thou great first cause—Supreme, Almighty Lord!— The wilderness is vocal with thy name— The solitudes are conscious of their God! Glory of Egypt and the Temple's pride!— Thou Titan of the woods—whose stately form Assumes an air of immortality— Cedar of Lebanon, begin the theme: The gusts of centuries dash o'er thy head— The thunders strike thy foot—yet all unharmed Thou stand'st superior to the elements, Firm in thine own unmatched magnificence;— And lift'st thy branches in triumphal song, A song of praise and power!—thy regal boughs, As eastern velvet—smooth, luxurious, soft; Thy tufted leaves, low drooping—like a veil— Glossy and green, and delicately curved, Gracing the vigour of their parent stem, Like Beauty round the neck of Hercules! Proud tree, from out whose glorious heart were formed Temples and palaces and statues vast; And ships, whose mighty prows defied the blast, The ship of Seostris the Egyptian Conqueror was formed of this timber, as also the gigantic statue of Diana in the Temple of Ephesus. Still be thy presence honoured, and thy name A stirring record to all after-time; A chronicle of greatness—desolate! Linger the mountain waters on their track, Charmed by thy modest beauty—weeping Birch— Lone Widow of the Woods—sad monitress— Bending like Piety before the shrine Of God-born Nature!—thou divinest tree!— Well may the waters linger 'neath thy glance, And kiss thy pendent tresses with cool lips, And float around thee in perpetual song! And thou, That midst the mountains of Calabria tow'rst Thy hundred heads, thy continent of leaves, Thou model of the picturesque, that won The soul of him whose genius lit the world With visions of the wonderful and grand!— Pride of Salvator Rosa—whose high name Evokes a sound familiar to our ears, And gladsome to our thoughts; brave Chesnut tree!— The sun-rise sheds its glory on thy leaves, And sun-set robes thee still; on every shore Fertile or barren art thou resident; The hunted stag beneath thy covert hides— And the gaunt wolf and spotted panther howl Through the long watch of night, scared by the gleam Of spectral moonlight on thy forked crest! Come forth, Spring calls thee forth, beautiful Elm,— Thy purple blossoms ope the first to hail The April sun-beam, and thy foliage, light As ocean spray—swells first to wreath the air:— Come forth, Spring calls thee forth, beautiful Elm— Thou and thy sister, the luxuriant Larch— The Lady of the Grove!—whose taper boughs Robed in their proud prosperity of leaves, O'ertop the shadowy level of the woods Like a rich obelisk of beryl!—Rise! Come forth! and glad the birds—and glad the sun— And fill the heart with meditative joy! And ever be thou consecrate—dark Yew, Whose shadow, like a midnight spectre, stands Close by the mouldering chancel, whose drear sigh Falls like the voice of graves—low, startling, deep: Whose branches through the long, cold, wintry night, Spread like dim shrouds—precursors of the tomb! Oh! ever be thou consecrate—thou wert A sacred symbol in the olden days; And art a moral, and shalt be a guide To future ages, when the living crowd Have glittered—smiled—exulted—and decayed! STANZAS FOR MUSIC. I I'll meet thee—I'll meet thee—my love! When the wild hare her covert forsakes; And called by the voice of the dove, The spirit of beauty awakes: When dews light the amaranth flower, And stars smile, like lovers, above; Oh! then in that beautiful hour, I'll meet thee—I'll meet thee—my love! II There is not a charm that the day, With its loveliest hues may impart; So dear as the moon's holy ray, Oh! Night keeps the key of the heart!— And spirits that worship her power, Her tenderest influence prove; Oh! then in that beautiful hour, I'll meet thee—I'll meet thee—my love! LAST WORDS OF LORD BYRON. “I must sleep now!” Vide “Life of Byron.” I The splendour of the Poet's lyre— The eloquence of fame— The spirit's intellectual fire— The glory and the name— The eagle wing that leaves behind, The proud stars in its flight— The power—the energy—the mind Unutterably bright: II The heart that sheds its own bright hues, And sings its own sweet strain; Imagination's gorgeous views— (That rainbow of the brain!)— Are all but transcripts of one truth— Reflections of one ray— And speak to man, and hint to youth, Of future dust—decay! III Sleep!—with thy glory round thy head— Far from the grasp of wrong; Sleep!—mightiest of the mighty dead— Thou idolized of Song! Sleep!—thou hast won a living tomb, Within the heart's warm core; And grief, nor care, nor blight, nor gloom, Shall never reach thee more! IV I fling my young song like a leaf, On Time's disastrous stream; To find existence frail and brief, The record of a dream; But earth shall be a thing forgot— Existence but a name— When British hearts remember not Thy genius and thy fame! V Sleep!—in thy majesty alone— No earthly shroud is thine; Sleep!—with a kingdom for thy throne— Eternity thy shrine! Sleep!—monarch of the human heart— Until the sign is given Which calls thee—glorious as thou art— To melodies of heaven! ANTOINETTE. “She was a phantom of delight, When first she gleamed upon my sight.” Wordsworth. Look, where she kneels—oh! never moonlight shone Upon a form more elegantly fair; The upraised eyes, bathed in the radiant dew Of youthful loveliness—the vermeil lip Half opened—like the scarlet pomegranate Budding in warmth and fragrance—curved and small, Oh! delicately small and slightly curved,— Beautiful lip! ah, soft and brilliant shrine Of love and harmony—and hope and thought!— Sweet oracle—delicious counsellor— Young, fervent, fond—how eloquent thou art! The tresses—like a warm and sunset cloud— Half gold, half auburn; braid a brow whereon Nature hath set her own immortal seal— Her sign of seraph glory:—temple meet For such a soul, instinct with love's best gifts, With all life's sweet affections redolent: Faith steadfast to the death—Love sanctified By hope—and Hope immortalized by love! Oh! I could gaze upon thee—till mine eyes Became idolaters, and worshipp'd nought Save thy surpassing beauty—oh! to leave The gay, proud world, its tinsel and its toys, And mid some green seclusion build a home Fit for thy gentle beauty, my fair love; Roses should twine for ever round the porch Of our white cot, the snow anemone, The blue germander, purple hyacinth,— Like a pure augury of happiness,— Should crown our lattice with their quiet grace, And I would love—oh! were it possible To treasure up the whole dear sum of love Possessed since the creation, I would deem Almost that mine of bliss diminutive To the deep passion of my soul for thee,— My flower, my deity, my graceful girl! FIRST LOVE. “Was not my work fulfilled and closed below? Had I not lived and loved? my lot was cast.” From the German of Schiller. I Love?—I will tell thee what it is to love! It is to build with human thoughts a shrine, Where Hope sits brooding like a beauteous dove; Where Time seems young, and Life a thing divine. All tastes—all pleasures—all desires combine To consecrate this sanctuary of bliss. Above—the stars in shroudless beauty shine;— Around—the streams their flowery margins kiss— And if there's heaven on earth; that heaven is surely this! II Yes, this is Love,—the stedfast and the true— The immortal glory which hath never set; The best, the brightest boon the heart e'er knew:— Of all life's sweets the very sweetest yet! Oh! who but can recall the eve they met To breathe, in some green walk, their first young vow, While summer flowers with moonlight dews were wet, And winds blew soft around the mountain's brow,— And all was rapture then—which is but memory now! III Honour may wreath the Victor's brow with bays, And Glory pour her treasures at his feet;— The Statesman win his country's honest praise— Fortune and Commerce in our cities meet: But when—ah! when were earth's possessions sweet— Unblest with one fond friend those gifts to share? The lowliest peasant in his calm retreat, Finds more of happiness, and less of care, Than hearts unwarm'd by love mid palace halls must bear! YOUTH. “Verse, a Breeze! mid blossoms straying, Where Hope clung feeding like a bee— Both were mine! Life went a maying With Nature, Hope, and Poesy, When I was young! When I was young? Ah, woful When!” Coleridge. Youth is like a fairy wave, Glittering in the morning light; Where the storm-winds never rave— Where the shore's for ever bright— Flowers exhale their glad perfume, O'er its calm, unruffled breast; And the coral's fadeless bloom, Wreaths its soft and moonlight rest: Joy and freedom light its track, Sun and song their beauty cast; Never doth it once look back On the green shore lessening fast: For gayer songs and purer skies Seem far away to have their birth; And Hope points onward to the prize— That prize so seldom found on earth! Oh! Happiness is rarely won, 'Tis like the Moon now beaming o'er us, Which still, however fast we run, Is faster fleeting on before us! The glad to-morrow of the mind, That idol of the human heart; Which myriads seek but never find, Still lures the wave to isles apart! Until the last sweet kindred flower Sighs to the wandering wave farewell; And like a dark and evil power, Glooms on the billows' swell! The tempest mutters deep and long, Ere yet its bolts in thunder burst; And Light and Beauty, Joy and Song, Flee to the home where they were nurst! No more a gay and rippling wave— But in its wild, ambitious pride, 'Tis hurling proud ships to a grave Within the channels wide! Ruin and wreck bestride its path— And with the foam of million steeds, Before the billows in their wrath, The “Ocean Conqueror” speeds! Till dashing in its fierce career Through caverns like a mighty tomb, 'Tis left—where ray ne'er wakes to cheer Its miserable doom! Its strength enfeebling day by day,— Impell'd by some unknown decree;— It wins its dark and rapid way, And wastes into Eternity! FINIS.</field>
