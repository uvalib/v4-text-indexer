      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. I. INEDITED POEMS, ETC. INTRODUCTORY TO THE WORKS OF SAMUEL DANIEL. FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. 1595–1623. I. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR Charles Blunt Knight, Lord Mountioy, and Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and his most worthy Lord. I do not plant thy great respected name Here in this front, to th'end thou shouldst protect These my endeuors from contempt or blame, Which none but their owne forces must effect: Nor do I seeke to win thy more respect, Most learned Lord, by these Essaies of mine, Since that cleere iudgement that did first elect To fauor me, will alwaies keepe me thine: Nor do I this more honour to assigne, Vnto thy worth, that is not more hereby, Since th'offrings made vnto the powers deuine, Enrich not them, but shew mens pietie: But this I do to th'end if destinie Shall any monument reserue of me, Those times should see my loue, how willing I That liu'd by thee, would haue thee liue with me. S. D. II. S. D. TO HIS BOOKE, In the Dedicating thereof to the Librarie in Oxford, erected by Sir Thomas Bodley Knight. Heere in this goodly Magazine of witte, This Storehouse of the choisest furniture The world doth yeelde, heer in this exquisite, And most rare monument, that dooth immure The glorious reliques of the best of men; Thou part imperfect worke, voutsafed art A little roome, by him whose care hath beene To gather all what euer might impart Delight or Profite to Posteritie; Whose hospitable bountie heere receiues Vnder this roofe powers of Diuinitie, Inlodg'd in these transformed shape of leaues. For which good Worke his Memorie heere liues, As th'holy guardian of this reuerent place, Sacred to Woorth, being fit that hee which giues Honour to others, should himselfe haue grace. And charitable Bodley that hath thus Done for the good of these, and other times, Must liue with them, and haue his fame with vs. For well wee see our groueling fortune climes Vp to that sphere of glory, to be seene From farre, by no course else, but by this way Of dooing publique good; this is the meane To shew we were, how fram'd, of what good clay. For well we see how priuate heapes (which care And / greedy toyle prouides for her owne endes) Doe speede with her succeeders, and what share Is left of all that store, for which it spendes It selfe, not hauing what it hath in vse, And no good t'others nor it selfe conferres: As if that Fortune mocking our abuse Would teach vs that it is not ours, but hers That which we leaue: and if we make it not The good of many, she will take that paine, And re-dispers th'inclosed parcelles got From many hands, t'in-common them againe. Which might aduise vs, that our selues should doe That worke with iudgement, which her blindnesse will, And passe a State which she cannot vndoe, And haue th'assurance in our owne name still. For this is to communicate with men That good the world gaue by societie, And not like beasts of prey, draw all to' our Den T'inglut our selues, and our owne progenie. This is to make our giftes immortall giftes, And thankes to last, whilst men, and bookes shall last; This heritage of glory neuer shiftes Nor changes Maisters; what thou leau'st thou hast. The grounds, the lands, which now thou callest thine, Haue had a thousand lords that term'd them theirs, And will be soone againe pent from thy line, By some concussion, change, or wastefull heires. We can no perpetuitie collate Vpon our race that euer will endure; It is the worlds demaines, whereof no state Can be by any cunning made so sure, But at the change of Lordes for all our paine, It will returne vnto the world againe. And therefore did discreet Antiquitie, Heere / (seeing how ill mens priuate cares did speede), Erect an euerlast[ing] Granery Of Artes, the vniuersall State to feede, And made the worlde their heire, whereby their name Holdes still a firme possession in the same. O well giuen landes, wherein all the whole land Hath an eternall share! where euery childe Borne vnto Letters, may be bolde to stand And claime his portion, and not be beguilde. Happy erected walles whose reuerent piles Harbour all commers, feede the multitude: Not like the prowd-built pallace that beguiles The hungry soule with empty solitude; Or onely raisde for priuate luxurie Stands as an open marke for Enuies view, And being the purchase of felicitie Is Fortunes in remainder, as her due. But you, blest you, the happy monuments Of Charitie and Zeale, stand and beholde Those vaine expences, and are documents To shew what glory hath the surest holde. You tell these times, wherein kind Pietie Is dead intestate, and true noble Worth Hath left no heire, that all things with vs die, Saue what is for the common good brought forth. Which this iudicious Knight did truely note, And therefore heere hath happily begunne To shew this age, that had almost forgot This way of glory, and thereby hath wonne So much of Time, as that his memorie Will get beyond it, and will neuer die. III. To her sacred Maiestie. Heere sacred Soueraigne, glorious Queen of Peace, The tumults of disordred times I sing, To glorifie thy Raigne, and to increase The wonder of those blessings thou doost bring Vpon thy land, which ioyes th'intire release From bloud and sorrowes by thy gouerning, That through affliction we may see our ioyes And blesse the glorie of Elizaes dayes. Happier then all thy great Progenitors That euer sate vpon that powrefull Throne; Or all thy mightiest neighbour-Gouernors, Which wonder at the blessings of thy Crowne, Whose Peace more glorious farre than all their warres, Haue greater powres of admiration showne; Receiue these humble fruites of mine increase, Offered on th'Altare of thy sacred Peace. I, who by that most blessed hand sustain'd, In quietnes, do eate the bread of rest: And by that all-reuiuing powre obtain'd That comfort which my Muse and me hath blest, Bring here this worke of Warre, whereby was gain'd This blessed Vnion which these wounds redrest, That sacred Concord which prepar'd the way Of glory for thee onely to enioy. Whereto if these my Labors shall attaine, And which, if Fortune giue me leaue to end, It will not be the least worke of thy Raigne, Nor that which least thy glory shall commend, Nor shall I hereby vainely entertaine Thy Land, with ydle shadowes to no end, But by thy Peace, teach what thy blessings are, The more t'abhorre this execrable warre. V. To the Reader. Behold once more with serious labor here Haue I refurnisht out this little frame, Repaird some parts defectiue here and there, And passages new added to the same: Some rooms inlargd, made some les th? they were Like to the curious builder who this yeare Puls downe, and alters what he did the last, As if the thing in doing were more deere Then being done, &amp; nothing likes thats past. For that we euer make the latter day The scholler of the former, and we find Something is still amisse that must delay Our busines, and leaue worke for vs behinde, As if there were no saboath of the minde. And howsoever be it, well or ill What I haue done, it is mine owne, I may Do whatsoeuer therewithall I will. I may pull downe, raise, and reedifie: It is the building of my life, the fee Of Nature, all th'inheritance that I Shall leaue to those which must come after me; And all the care I haue is but to see Those lodgings of m' affections neatly drest, Wherein so many noble friends there be Whose memories with mine must therein rest. And glad I am that I haue liud to see This edifice renewd, who doo but long To liue t'amend. For man is a tree That hath his fruite late ripe, and it is long Before he come t'his taste; there doth belong So much t'experience, and so infinite The faces of things are, as hardly we Discerne which lookes the likest vnto right. Besides these curious times, stuf'd with the store Of c?positions in this kind, to driue Me to examine my defects the more, And oft would make me not my self belieue, Did I not know the world wherein I liue: Which neither is so wise, as that would seeme Nor certaine iudgement of those things doth giue That it disliks, nor that it doth esteeme. I know no work from man yet euer came But had his marke, and by some error shewd That it was his, and yet what in the same Was rare, and worthy, euermore allowd Safe c?uoy for the rest: the good thats sow'd Though rarely paies our cost, &amp; who so lookt T'haue all thinges in perfection, &amp; in frame In mens inuentions, neuer must read books. And howsoeuer here detraction may Disvalew this my labour, yet I know There will be fo?d therein, that which wil pay The reckning for the errors which I owe, And likewise will sufficiently allow T'an vndistasted iudgement fit delight, And let presumptuous selfe-opinion say The woorst it can, I know I shall haue right. I know I shalbe read among the rest So long as men speake english, and so long As verse and vertue shal be in request, Or grace to honest industry belong: And England since I vse thy present tongue, Thy forme of speech, thou must be my def?ce If to new eares it seemes not well exprest; For though I hold not accent I hold sence. And since the measures of our tong we see Confirmd, by no edict of power doth rest But onely vnderneath the regencie Of vse and fashion, which may be the best Is not for my poore forces to contest: But as the Peacock, seeing himselfe to weake, Confest the Eagle fairer farre to be, And yet not in his feathers but his beake; Authoritie of powerfull censure may Preiudicate the forme wherein we mould This matter of our spirite, but if it pay The eare with substance, we haue what wee wold, For that is all which must our credit hold. The rest (how euer gay, or seeming rich It be in fashion wise men will not wey), The stamp will not allowe it but the touch. And would to God that nothing falty were But only that poore accent in my verse, Or that I could all other recknings cleere Wherwith my heart stands charg'd, or might reverse The errors of my iudgm?t passed here, Or els where, in my bookes, and vnrehearce What I haue vainely said, or haue addrest Vnto neglect, mistaken in the rest. Which I do hope to liue yet to retract And craue that England neuer will take note That it was mine. Ile disauow mine act, And wish it may for euer be forgot. I trust the world will not of me exact Against my will, that hath all els I wrote. I will aske nothing therein for my paine But onely to haue in mine owne againe. II. SONNETS TO DELIA. 1592. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE Lady Mary, Countesse of Pembrooke. Wonder of these, glory of other times, O thou whom Enuy eu'n is forst t'admyre: Great Patroness of these my humble Rymes, Which thou from out thy greatnes doost inspire: Sith onely thou hast deign'd to rayse them higher, Vouchsafe now to accept them as thine owne, Begotten by thy hand, and my desire, Wherein my Zeale, and thy great might is showne. And seeing this vnto the world is knowne, O leaue not, still to grace thy worke in mee: Let not the quickning seede be ouer-throwne, Of that which may be borne to honour thee. Whereof, the trauaile I may challenge mine, But yet the glory, (Madam) must be thine. TO DELIA. SONNET. I. [Vnto the boundlesse Ocean of thy beautie] Vnto the boundlesse Ocean of thy beautie, Runnes this poore Riuer, charg'd with streames of zeale: Returning thee the tribute of my dutie, Which here my loue, my youth, my plaints reueale. Here I vnclaspe the Booke of my charg'd soule, Where I haue cast th'accounts of all my care: Here haue I summ'd my sighs, here I inrole How they were spent for thee; looke what they are: Looke on the deere expences of my youth, And see how iust I reckon with thine eies: Examine well thy beautie with my truth, And crosse my cares ere greater summes arise. Reade it (sweet maide) though it be done but sleightly; Who can shew all his loue, doth loue but lightly. SONNET. II. [Goe wailing Verse, the Infants of my loue] Goe wailing Verse, the Infants of my loue, Minerua-like, brought foorth without a mother: Present the Image of the cares I proue, Witnesse your Fathers griefe exceedes all other. Sigh out a Storie of her cruell deedes, With interrupted accents of despaire: A Monument that whosoeuer reedes, May iustly praise, and blame my louelesse Faire. Say her disdaine hath dryed vp my blood, And starued you, in succours still denying: Presse to her eyes, importune me some good. Waken her sleeping pitty with your crying, Knocke at that hard hart, begge till you haue mou'd her, And tell th'vnkinde, how dearely I haue lou'd her. SONNET. III. [If so it hap, this of-spring of my care] If so it hap, this of-spring of my care, These fatall Antheames, sad and mornefull Songs: Come to their view, who like afflicted are; Let them yet sigh their owne, and mone my wrongs. But vntoucht hearts, with vnaffected eie, Approach not to behold so great distresse: Cleere-sighted you, soone note what is awrie, Whilst blinded ones mine errours neuer gesse. You blinded soules whom youth and errour leade, You out-cast Eaglets, dazeled with your Sunne: Ah you, and none but you my sorrowes reade, You best can iudge the wrongs that she hath done. That she hath done, the motiue of my paine, Who whilst I loue, doth kill me with disdaine. SONNET. IIII. [These plaintiue Verse, the Postes of my desire] These plaintiue Verse, the Postes of my desire, Which haste for succour to her slow regard: Beare not report of any slender fire, Forging a griefe to winne a fames reward. Nor are my passions limnd for outward hew, For that no colours can depaint my sorrowes: Delia her selfe, and all the world may view Best in my face, how cares haue tild deepe forrowes. No Bayes I seeke to decke my mourning brow, O cleere-eyde Rector of the holy Hill: My humble accents beare the Oliue bough, Of intercession but to moue her will. These lines I vse, t'vnburthen mine owne hart; My loue affects no fame, nor steemes of Art. SONNET. V. [VVhilst youth and error led my wandring minde] VVhilst youth and error led my wandring minde, And set my thoughts in heedlesse wayes to range: All vnawares, a Goddesse chaste I finde, (Diana-like) to worke my sudden change. For her no sooner had mine eyes bewraid, But with disdaine to see me in that place; With fairest hand, the sweet vnkindest Maid, Cast water-cold Disdaine vpon my face. Which turn'd my sport into a Harts dispaire, Which still is chac'd, while I haue any breath, By mine owne thoughts, set on me by my Faire: My thoughts (like Houndes) pursue me to my death. Those that I fostred of mine owne accord, Are made by her to murther thus their Lord. SONNET. VI. [Faire is my Loue, and cruell as she's faire] Faire is my Loue, and cruell as she's faire; Her brow shades frownes, although her eyes are sunny, Her smiles are lightning, though her pride despaire; And her disdaines are Gall, her fauours Hunny. A modest Maide, deckt with a blush of honor, Whose feete doe tread greene paths of youth and loue, The wonder of all eyes that looke vpon her: Sacred on earth, design'd a Saint aboue. Chastitie and Beautie, which were deadly foes, Liue reconciled friends within her brow: And had she pitty to conioyne with those, Then who had heard the plaints I vtter now? For had she not beene faire and thus vnkinde, My Muse had slept, and none had knowne my minde. SONNET. VII. [For had she not beene faire and thus vnkinde] For had she not beene faire and thus vnkinde, Then had no finger pointed at my lightnesse: The world had neuer knowne what I doe finde, And cloudes obscure had shaded still her brightnesse. Then had no Censors eye these lines suruaid, Nor grauer browes haue iudg'd my Muse so vaine No Sunne my blush and error had bewraid, Nor yet the world haue heard of such disdaine. Then had I walkt with bold erected face, No downe-cast looke had signified my misse: But my degraded hopes, with such disgrace Did force me grone out griefes, and vtter this. For being full, should I not then haue spoken, My sence oppress'd, had faild, and heart had broken. SONNET. VIII. [Thou poore heart sacrifiz'd vnto the fairest] Thou poore heart sacrifiz'd vnto the fairest, Hast sent the incense of thy sighs to heauen: And still against her frownes fresh vowes repairest, And made thy passions with her beautie euen. And you mine eyes, the agents of my hart Tolde the dumbe message of my hidden griefe: And oft with carefull turnes, with silent Art, Did treate the cruell faire to yeeld reliefe. And you my Verse, the Aduocates of Loue, Haue followed hard the Processe of my case: And vrg'd that title which doth plainely proue, My faith should win, if Iustice might haue place. Yet though I see, that nought we doe, can moue, Tis not disdaine must make me leaue to loue. SONNET. IX. [If this be loue, to draw a wearie breath] If this be loue, to draw a wearie breath, To paint on floods, till the shore crie to th'aire: With downeward lookes, still reading on the earth, These sad memorials of my loues dispaire: If this be loue, to warre against my soule, Lie downe to waile, rise vp to sigh and grieue, The neuer-resting stone of Care to roule, Still to complaine my griefes, whilst none relieue. If this be loue, to cloathe me with darke thoughts, Haunting vntrodden paths to waile apart; My pleasures horror, Musicke tragicke notes, Teares in mine eyes, and sorrow at my hart. If this be loue, to liue a liuing death, Then doe I loue and draw this wearie breath. SONNET. X. [Then doe I loue, and draw this wearie breath] Then doe I loue, and draw this wearie breath, For her the cruell Faire, within whose brow I written finde the sentence of my death, In vnkinde Letters; wrote she cares not how. Thou powre that rul'st the confines of the night, Laughter louing Goddesse, worldly pleasures Queene, Intenerat that heart that sets so light, The truest loue that euer yet was seene. And cause her leaue to triumph in this wise, Vpon the prostrate spoyle of that poore hart That serues a Trophey to her conquering eies, And must their glory to the world impart. Once let her know, sh'hath done enough to proue me, And let her pitte if she cannot loue me. SONNET. XI. [Teares, vowes, and prayers, winne the hardest hart] Teares, vowes, and prayers, winne the hardest hart, Teares, vowes, and prayers haue I spent in vaine; Teares cannot soften flint, nor vowes conuart, Prayers preuaile not with a quaint disdaine. I lose my teares where I haue lost my loue, I vow my faith, where faith is not regarded; I pray in vaine, a mercilesse to moue: So rare a faith ought better be rewarded. Yet, though I cannot winne her will with teares, Though my soules Idoll scorneth all my vowes; Though all my prayers be to so deafe eares, No fauour though, the cruell faire allowes, Yet will I weepe, vow, pray to cruell shee: Flint, frost, disdaine, weares, meltes, and yeeldes we see. SONNET. XII. [My spotlesse loue houers with purest wings] My spotlesse loue houers with purest wings, About the Temple of the proudest frame: Where blaze those lights fairest of earthly things, Which cleere our clouded world with brightest flame. M'ambitious thoughts confined in her face, Affect no honor but what she can giue: My hopes doe rest in limits of her grace, I weigh no comfort vnlesse she relieue. For she that can my heart imparadize, Holdes in her fairest hand what dearest is, My fortunes wheeles the circle of her eies, Whose rowling grace deigne once a turne of blis. All my liues sweet consists in her alone, So much I loue the most vnlouing one. SONNET. XIII. [Behold what hap Pigmalion had to frame] Behold what hap Pigmalion had to frame And carue his proper griefe vpon a stone; My heauy fortune is much like the same, I worke on flint, and thats the cause I mone. For haplesse loe euen with mine owne desires, I figurde on the table of mine hart, The fairest forme, that all the world admires, And so did perish by my proper art. And still I toyle, to change the Marble brest Of her, whose sweetest grace I do adore, Yet cannot finde her breathe vnto my rest, Hard is her hart, and woe is me therefore. But happy he that ioy'd his stone and art, Vnhappy I, to loue a stony hart. SONNET. XIIII. [Those snary locks, are those same nets (my Deere)] Those snary locks, are those same nets (my Deere) Wherewith my liberty thou didst surprize; Loue was the flame that fired me so neere, The Dart transpearsing, were those Christall eies. Strong is the net, and feruent is the flame; Deepe is the wound my sighes can well report: Yet do I loue, adore, and prayse the same, That holds, that burnes, that wounds me in this sort. And list not seeke to breake, to quench, to heale, The bond, the flame, the wound that festreth so, By knife, by liquor, or by salue to deale: So much I please to perish in my woe. Yet least long trauailes be aboue my strength, Good Delia lose, quench, heale me now at length. SONNET. XV. [If that a loyall hart and faith vnfained] If that a loyall hart and faith vnfained, If a sweet languish with a chast desire, If hunger-staruen thoughts so long retained, Fed but with smoke, and cherisht but with fire: And if a brow with cares characters painted, Bewraies my loue, with broken words halfe spoken To her that sits in my thoughts Temple sainted, And laies to view my Vultur-gnawne hart open: If I haue done due homage to her eyes, And had my sighes still tending on her name; If on her loue my life and honour lyes, And she (th'vnkindest maid) still scorns the same: Let this suffice, that all the world may see The fault is hers, though mine the hurt must be. SONNET. XVI. [Happy in sleepe, waking content to languish] Happy in sleepe, waking content to languish, Imbracing clouds by night, in day time mourne, My ioys but shadowes, touch of truth, my anguish, Griefes euer springing, comforts neuer borne. And still expecting when she will relent, Growne hoarce with crying mercy, mercy giue, So many vowes, and praiers hauing spent, That weary of my life, I loath to liue. And yet the Hydra of my cares renues Still new borne sorrowes of her fresh disdaine: And still my hope the Sommer windes pursues, Finding no end nor period of my paine. This is my state, my griefes do touch so neerly, And thus I liue because I loue her deerly. SONNET. XVII. [VVhy should I sing in verse, why should I frame] VVhy should I sing in verse, why should I frame These sad neglected notes for her deare sake? Why should I offer vp vnto her name, The sweetest sacrifice my youth can make? Why should I striue to make her liue for euer, That neuer deignes to giue me ioy to liue? Why should m'afflicted Muse so much endeuour, Such honour vnto cruelty to giue? If her defects haue purchast her this fame, What should her vertues do, her smiles, her loue? If this her worst, how should her best inflame? What passions would her milder fauours moue? Fauours (I thinke) would sence quite ouercome, And that makes happy Louers euer dombe. SONNET. XVIII. [Since the first looke that led me to this error] Since the first looke that led me to this error, To this thoughts-maze, to my confusion tending: Still haue I liu'd in griefe, in hope, in terror, The circle of my sorrowes neuer ending. Yet cannot leaue her loue that holds me hatefull, Her eyes exact it, though her hart disdaines me; See what reward he hath that serues the vngratefull, So true and loyall loue no fauour gaines me. Still must I whet my yong desires abated, Vpon the flint of such a hart rebelling; And all in vaine, her pride is so innated, She yeelds no place at all for pitties dwelling. Oft haue I told her that my soule did loue her, (And that with teares) yet all this will not moue her. SONNET. XIX. [Restore thy tresses to the golden Ore] Restore thy tresses to the golden Ore, Yeeld Cithereas sonne those Arkes of loue; Bequeath the heauens the starres that I adore, And to th'Orient do thy Pearles remoue, Yeeld thy hands pride vnto th'Iuory white, T'Arabian odors giue thy breathing sweete: Restore thy blush vnto Aurora bright, To Thetis giue the honour of thy feete. Let Venus haue thy graces, her resign'd, And thy sweet voice giue back vnto the Spheares: But yet restore thy fierce and cruell mind, To Hyrcan Tygres, and to ruthles Beares. Yeeld to the Marble thy hard hart againe; So shalt thou cease to plague, and I to paine. SONNET. XX. [VVhat it is to breathe and liue without life] VVhat it is to breathe and liue without life: How to be pale with anguish, red with feare, T'haue peace abroad, and nought within but strife: Wish to be present, and yet shun t'appeare: How to be bold far off, and bashfull neare: How to thinke much, and haue no words to speake: To craue redresse, yet hold affliction deare: To haue affection strong, a body weake, Neuer to finde, and euermore to seeke: And seeke that which I dare not hope to finde: T'affect this life, and yet this life disleeke: Gratefull t'another, to my selfe vnkinde. This cruell knowledge of these contraries, Delia my hart hath learnd out of those eyes. SONNET. XXI. [If beauty thus be clowded with a frowne] If beauty thus be clowded with a frowne, That pitty shines no comfort to my blis, And vapours of disdaine so ouergrowne That my liues light wholy in-darkned is. Why should I more molest the world with cries? The ayre with sighes, the earth below with teares? Sith I liue hatefull to those ruthlesse eies, Vexing with vntun'd moane her dainty eares. If I haue lou'd her dearer then my breath, My breath that calls the heauens to witnes it: And still must hold her deare till after death, And that all this mooues not her thoughts a whit, Yet sure she cannot but must thinke a part, She doth me wrong, to grieue so true a heart. SONNET. XXII. [Come Time the anchor-hold of my desire] Come Time the anchor-hold of my desire, My last Resort whereto my hopes appeale, Cause once the date of her disdaine t'expire: Make her the sentence of her wrath repeale. Rob her faire Brow, breake in on Beauty, steale Powre from those eyes, which pitty cannot spare: Deale with those dainty cheekes as she doth deale With this poore heart consumed with dispaire. This heart made now the prospectiue of care, By louing her, the cruelst Faire that liues, The cruelst Fayre that sees I pine for her, And neuer mercy to thy merit giues. Let her not still triumph ouer the prize Of mine affections taken by her eies. SONNET. XXIII. [Time, cruell time, come and subdue that Brow] Time, cruell time, come and subdue that Brow Which conquers all but thee, and thee too staies As if she were exempt from Syeth or Bow, From loue or yeares vnsubiect to decaies. Or art thou growne in league with those faire eies That they may helpe thee to consume our daies? Or dost thou spare her for her cruelties, Being merciles like thee that no man weies? And yet thou seest thy powre she disobayes, Cares not for thee, but lets thee waste in vaine, And prodigall of howers and yeares betraies Beauty and youth t'opinion and disdaine. Yet spare her Time, let her exempted be, She may become more kinde to thee or me. SONNET. XXIIII. [These sorrowing sighes, the smoake of mine annoy] These sorrowing sighes, the smoake of mine annoy, These teares, which heate of sacred flame distils, Are those due tributes that my faith doth pay Vnto the tyrant, whose vnkindnes kils. I sacrifise my youth, and blooming yeares At her proud feete, and she respects not it; My flower vntimely's withred with my teares: And Winter woes, for spring of youth vnfit. She thinkes a looke may recompence my care, And so with lookes, prolongs my long-lookt ease, As short that blisse, so is the comfort rare, Yet must that blisse my hungry thoughts appease. Thus she returnes my hopes so fruitlesse euer, Once let her loue indeed, or els eye me neuer. SONNET. XXV. [False Hope prolongs my euer certaine griefe] False Hope prolongs my euer certaine griefe, Traitour to me, and faithfull to my Loue: A thousand times it promis'd me reliefe, Yet neuer any true effect I proue. Oft when I finde in her no truth at all, I banish her, and blame her trechery, Yet soone againe I must her backe recall, As one that dies without her company. Thus often as I chase my hope from me, Straight-way she hasts her vnto Delias eies: Fed with some pleasing looke there shall she be, And so sent backe, and thus my fortune lies. Lookes feed my Hope, Hope fosters me in vaine, Hopes are vnsure, when certaine is my paine. SONNET. XXVI. [Looke in my griefes, and blame me not to mourne] Looke in my griefes, and blame me not to mourne, From care to care that leades a life so bad; Th'Orphan of Fortune, borne to be her scorne, Whose clouded brow doth make my daies so sad. Long are their nights whose cares do neuer sleepe, Lothsome their daies, whom no sun euer ioyd, Th'impression of her eyes do pearce so deepe, That thus I liue both day and night annoyd. But since the sweetest roote yeelds fruite so sowre, Her praise from my complaint I may not part: I loue th'effect the cause being of this powre, Ile praise her face, and blame her flinty heart. Whilst we both make the world admire at vs, Her for disdaine, and me for louing thus. SONNET. XXVII. [Oft and in vaine my rebel thoughts haue ventred] Oft and in vaine my rebel thoughts haue ventred, To stop the passage of my vanquisht hart: And shut those waies my friendly foe first entred, Hoping thereby to free my better part. And whilst I garde these windowes of this forte, Where my harts theese to vexe me made her choice: And thether all my forces doe transporte, An other passage opens at her voice. Her voyce betraies me to her hand and eye: My freedomes tyrants conquering all by arte. But ah, what glorie can she get thereby, With thee such powers to plague one silly harte. Yet my soules soueraigne, since I must resigne, Reigne in my thoughts, my loue and life are thine. SONNET. XXVIII. [Raigne in my thoughts faire hand, sweete eye, rare voice] Raigne in my thoughts faire hand, sweete eye, rare voice, Possesse me whole, my hearts triumvirate: Yet heauy heart to make so hard a choise, Of such as spoile thy poore afflicted state. For whilst they striue which shall be Lord of all, All my poore life by them is troden downe; They all erect their Trophies on my fall, And yeeld me nought that giues them their renowne. When backe I looke, I sigh my freedome past, And waile the state wherein I present stand: And see my fortune euer like to last, Finding me rain'd with such a heauy hand. What can I do but yeeld? and yeeld I doo, And serue all three, and yet they spoile me too. SONNET. XXIX. [Like as the spotlesse Ermelin distrest] To M. P. Like as the spotlesse Ermelin distrest, Circumpass'd round with filth and lothsome mud: Pines in her griefe, imprisoned in her nest, And cannot issue forth to seeke her good. So I inuiron'd with a hatefull want, Looke to the heauens; the heauens yeelde forth no grace: I search the earth, the earth I finde as skant, I view my selfe, my selfe in wofull case. Heauen nor earth will not, my selfe cannot wake A way through want to free my soule from care: But I must pine, and in my pining lurke, Least my sad lookes bewray me how I fare. My fortune mantled with a clowde s'obscure; Thus shades my life so long as wants endure. SONNET. XXX. [My cares draw on mine euerlasting night] My cares draw on mine euerlasting night, In horrors sable clowdes sets my liues sunne: My liues sweet sunne, my dearest comforts light, Will rise no more to me, whose day is dunne. I goe before vnto the Mirtle shades. To attend the presence of my worlds Deere; And there prepare her flowres that neuer fades, And all things fit against her comming there. If any aske me why so soone I came, Ile hide her sinne and say it was my lot: In life and death Ile tender her good name, My life nor death shal neuer be her blot. Although this world may seeme her deede to blame, Th'Elisian ghosts shall neuer know the same. SONNET. XXXI. [VVhilst by thy eies pursu'd, my poore heart flew] Alluding to the Sparrow pursued by a Hawke, that flew into the bosome of Zenocrates. VVhilst by thy eies pursu'd, my poore heart flew Into the sacred Refuge of thy brest: Thy rigor in that Sanctuary slew That which thy succring mercy should haue blest. No priuiledge of faith could it protect, Faith being with blood, and fiue yeares witnes sign'd, Wherein no shew gaue cause of least suspect, For well thou saw'st my loue and how I pin'd Yet no mild comfort would thy Brow reueale, No lightning lookes which falling hopes erect: What bootes to lawes of Succor to appeale? Ladies and Tyrants, neuer lawes respect. Then there I die from whence my life should come, And by that hand whom such deeds ill become. SONNET. XXXII. [The Starre of my mishap impos'd this paine] The Starre of my mishap impos'd this paine To spend the Aprill of my yeares in griefe: Finding my fortune euer in the waine With still fresh cares, supplide with no reliefe. Yet thee I blame not, though for thee tis done, But these weake whings presuming to aspire, Which now are melted by thine eyes bright sun, That makes me fall from off my hie desire. And in my fall I crye for helpe with speede, No pittying eye lookes backe vpon my feares: No succour finde I now when most I neede, My heates must drowne in th'Ocean of my teares. Which still must beare the title of my wrong, Caus'd by those cruell beames that were so strong. SONNET. XXXIII. [Still in the trace of one perplexed thought] Still in the trace of one perplexed thought, My ceasles cares continually run on: Seeking in vaine what I haue euer sought, One in my loue, and her hard hart still one. I who did neuer ioy in other Sun, And haue no stars but those, that must fulfill The worke of rigor, fatally begun Vpon this heart, whom cruelty will kill. Iniurious Delia yet I loue thee still, And will whilst I shall draw this breath of mine, Ile tell the world that I deseru'd but ill, And blame my selfe t'excuse that heart of thine. See then who sinnes the greater of vs twaine, I in my loue, or thou in thy disdaine. SONNET. XXXIIII. [Oft do I maruell, whether Delias eies] Oft do I maruell, whether Delias eies, Are eyes, or els two radiant starres that shine For how could Nature euer thus deuise, Of earth on earth a substance so diuine. Starres sure they are, whose motions rule desires, And calme and tempest follow their aspects: Their sweet appearing still such power inspires, That makes the world admire so strange effects, Yet whether fixt or wandring starres are they, Whose influence rule the Orbe of my poore hart? Fixt sure they are, but wandring make me stray, In endles errors, whence I cannot part. Starres then, not eyes, moue you with a milder view, Your sweet aspect on him that honours you. SONNET. XXXV. [And yet I cannot reprehend the flight] And yet I cannot reprehend the flight, Or blame th'attempt presuming so to sore; The mounting venter for a high delight, Did make the honour of the fall the more. For who gets wealth that puts not from the shore? Danger hath honor, great designes their fame, Glory doth follow, courage goes before. And though th'euent oft answers not the same, Suffice that high attempts haue neuer shame. The meane obseruer (whom base safety keeps) Liues without honour, dies without a name, And in eternall darknesse euer sleeps. And therefore Delia, tis to me no blot, To haue attempted, though attaind thee not. SONNET. XXXVI. [Raising my hopes on hills of high desire] Raising my hopes on hills of high desire, Thinking to scale the heauen of her hart, My slender meanes presum'd too high a part; Her thunder of disdaine forst me retire, And threw me downe to paine in all this fire, Where loe I languish in so heauy smart, Because th'attempt was farre aboue my art: Her pride brook'd not poore soules should so aspire. Yet I protest my high desiring will Was not to dispossesse her of her right: Her soueraignty should haue remained still, I onely sought the blisse to haue her sight. Her sight contented thus to see me spill, Fram'd my desires fit for her eyes to kill. SONNET. XXXVII. [VVhy doost thou Delia credit so thy glasse] VVhy doost thou Delia credit so thy glasse, Gazing thy beauty deign'd thee by the skies: And doest not rather looke on him (alas) Whose state best shewes the force of murdering eies? The broken tops of lofty trees declare The fury of a mercy-wanting storme; And of what force thy wounding graces are, Vpon my selfe thou best mayst finde the forme: Then leaue thy glasse, and gaze thy selfe on me, That Mirror shewes what power is in thy face: To view your forme too much, may danger bee, Narcissus chang'd t'a flower in such a case. And you are chang'd, but not t'a Hiacint; I feare your eye hath turnd your heart to flint. SONNET. XXXVIII. [I once may see when yeares shall wreck my wrong] I once may see when yeares shall wreck my wrong, When golden haires shall change to siluer wier: And those bright raies that kindle all this fire, Shall faile in force, their working not so strong: Then beauty (now the burthen of my song) VVhose glorious blaze the world doth so admire, Must yeeld vp all to tyrant Times desire; Then fade those flowers that deckt her pride so long. VVhen, if she grieue to gaze her in her glasse, Which, then presents her winter-withered hew, Goe you my verse, go tell her what she was; For what she was, she best shall find in you. Your firy heate lets not her glory passe, But (Phænix-like) shall make her liue anew. SONNET. XXXIX. [Looke Delia how w'esteeme the halfe blowne Rose] Looke Delia how w'esteeme the halfe blowne Rose, The image of thy blush and Sommers honor: Whilst yet her tender bud doth vndisclose That full of beauty, time bestowes vpon her. No sooner spreads her glory in the ayre, But straight her wide blowne pomp comes to decline: She then is scornd that late adornd the Fayre; So fade the Roses of those cheeks of thine. No Aprill can reuiue thy withered flowres, Whose springing grace adorns thy glory now: Swift speedy Time, feathred with flying houres, Dissolues the beauty of the fairest brow. Then do not thou such treasure wast in vaine, But loue now whilst thou maist be lou'd againe. SONNET. XL. [Bvt loue whilst that thou maist be lou'd againe] Bvt loue whilst that thou maist be lou'd againe, Now whilst thy May hath fild thy lap with flowers, Now whilst thy beauty beares without a staine; Now vse the Sommer smiles, ere Winter lowers. And whilst thou spreadst vnto the rising sunne, The fairest flowre that euer saw the light, Now ioy thy time before thy sweet be done. And (Delia) thinke thy morning must haue night, And that thy brightnes sets at length to West, When thou wilt close vp that which now thou show'st, And thinke the same becomes thy fading best, Which then shall most inuaile and shadow most. Men do not wey the stalke for that it was, When once they find her flowre her glory pas. SONNET. XLI. [VVhen men shall find thy flower, thy glory passe] VVhen men shall find thy flower, thy glory passe, And thou with carefull brow sitting alone: Receiued hast this message from thy glasse, That tells the truth, and sayes that all is gone; Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madst, Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining, I that haue lou'd thee thus before thou fadst, My faith shall waxe, when thou are in thy waining. The world shall finde this myracle in me, That fire can burne when all the matter's spent: Then what my faith hath bene thy selfe shall see, And that thou wast vnkinde, thou mayst repent. Thou maist repent that thou hast scornd my teares, When winter snowes vpon thy sable haires. SONNET. XLII. [VVhen winter snowes vpon thy sable haires] VVhen winter snowes vpon thy sable haires, And frost of age hath nipt thy beauties neere, When darke shall seeme thy day that neuer cleares, And all lies withred that was held so deere. Then take this picture which I here present thee, Limmed with a Pensill not all vnworthy: Here see the gifts that God and nature lent thee, Here read thy selfe, and what I suffred for thee. This may remaine thy lasting monument, Which happily posterity may cherrish, These colours with thy fading are not spent, These may remaine when thou and I shall perish. If they remaine, then thou shalt liue thereby, They will remaine, and so thou canst not die. SONNET. XLIII. [Thou canst not die whilst any zeale abound] Thou canst not die whilst any zeale abound In feeling hearts that can conceiue these lines; Though thou a Laura hast no Petrarch found, In base attire, yet cleerly Beauty shines. And I (though borne within a colder clime,) Do feele mine inward heat as great (I know it:) He neuer had more faith, although more rime, I loue as well, though he could better show it. But I may adde one feather to thy fame, To helpe her flight throughout the fairest Ile, And if my pen could more enlarge thy name, Then shouldst thou liue in an immortall stile. For though that Laura better limned be, Suffice, thou shalt be lou'd as well as shee. SONNET. XLIIII. [Be not displeasd that these my papers should] Be not displeasd that these my papers should Bewray vnto the world how faire thou art: Or that my wits haue shewed the best they could. (The chastest flame that euer warmed hart) Thinke not (sweet Delia) this shall be thy shame, My Muse should sound thy praise with mournfull warble: How many liue, the glory of whose name Shall rest in Ise, when thine is grau'd in Marble. Thou maist in after ages liue esteem'd, Vnburied in these lines reseru'd in purenes; These shall intombe those eies, that haue redeem'd Me from the vulgar, thee from all obscurenes. Although my carefull accents neuer moou'd thee, Yet count it no disgrace that I haue lou'd thee. SONNET. XLV. [Delia, these eyes that so admireth thine] Delia, these eyes that so admireth thine, Haue seene those walls which proud ambition rear'd To check the world, how they intomb'd haue lien Within themselues, and on them ploughs haue ear'd. Yet neuer found that barbarous hand attaind The spoyle of fame deseru'd by vertuous men: Whose glorious actions luckily had gaind Th'eternall Annals of a happy pen. And therefore grieue not if thy beauties die, Though time do spoyle thee of the fairest vaile That euer yet couered mortality, And must instarre the Needle, and the Raile. That Grace which doth more then in woman thee, Liues in my lines, and must eternall bee. SONNET. XLVI. [Most faire and louely Maide, looke from the shore] Most faire and louely Maide, looke from the shore, See thy Leander striuing in these waues: Poore soule quite spent, whose force can do no more, Now send forth hope, for now calme pitty saues. And waft him to thee with those louely eies, A happy conuoy to a holy Land: Now shew thy power, and where thy vertue lies, To saue thine owne, stretch out the fairest hand. Stretch out the fairest hand, a pledge of peace; That hand that darts so right and neuer misses: I shall forget old wrongs, my griefes shall cease; And that which gaue me wounds, Ile giue it kisses. Once let the Ocean of my cares finde shore, That thou be pleas'd, and I may sigh no more. SONNET. XLVII. [Read in my face, a volume of dispaires] Read in my face, a volume of dispaires, The wailing Iliads of my tragicke woe: Drawne with my blood, and painted with my cares, Wrought by her hand that I haue honour'd so. Who whilst I burne, she sings at my soules wrack, Looking aloft from turret of her pride: There my soules tyrant ioyes her, in the sack Of her owne seate, whereof I made her guide. There do these smoakes that from affliction rise, Serue as an incense to a cruell Dame: A sacrifice thrice-gratefull to her eies, Because their power serue to exact the same. Thus ruines she (to satisfie her will,) The temple, where her name was honour'd still. SONNET. XLVIII. [My Delia hath the waters of mine eies] My Delia hath the waters of mine eies, The ready handmayds on her grace t'attend: That neuer fall to ebbe, but euer rise, For to their flow she neuer grants an end. Th'Ocean neuer did attend more duly Vpon his souereignes course, the nights pale Queene, Nor payd the impost of his waues more truly, Then mine vnto her cruelty hath beene. Yet nought the rocke of that hard heart can moue, Where beat these teares with zeale, and fury driues: And yet I'd rather languish for her loue, Then I would ioy the fairest she that liues. And if I finde such pleasure to complaine, What should I do then, if I should obtaine? SONNET. XLIX. [How long shall I in mine affliction mourne?] How long shall I in mine affliction mourne? A burden to my selfe, distrest in minde: When shall my interdicted hopes returne, From out dispaire, wherein they liue confinde? When shal her troubled brow charg'd with disdaine Reueale the treasure which her smiles impart? When shall my faith the happines attaine, To breake the Ise that hath congeald her heart? Vnto her selfe, her selfe my loue doth sommon, (If loue in her hath any power to moue,) And let her tell me as she is a woman, Whether my faith hath not deseru'd her loue? I know her heart cannot but iudge with me, Although her eyes my aduersaries be. SONNET. L. [Beautie (sweet Loue) is like the morning dew] Beautie (sweet Loue) is like the morning dew, Whose short refresh vpon the tender greene: Cheeres for a time, but till the Sunne doth shew, And straight tis gone as it had neuer beene. Soone doth it fade that makes the fairest florish, Short is the glory of the blushing Rose: The hew which thou so carefully dost norish, Yet which at length thou must be forc'd to lose. When thou surcharg'd with burthen of thy yeeres, Shalt bend thy wrinckles homeward to the earth, And that in Beauties lease expir'd, appeares The date of Age, the Kalends of our death. But ah! no more, this must not be foretold, For women grieue to thinke they must be old. SONNET. LI. [I must not griue my Loue, whose eies would reede] I must not griue my Loue, whose eies would reede Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smile: Flowers haue a time before they come to seede, And she is yong, and now must sport the while. Ah sport (sweet Maide) in season of these yeares, And learne to gather flowers before they wither: And where the sweetest blossomes first appeares, Let loue and youth conduct thy pleasures thither. Lighten foorth smiles to cleere the clouded aire, And calme the tempest which my sighs doo raise: Pitty and smiles doe best become the faire, Pitty and smiles must onely yeeld thee praise. Make me to say, when all my griefes are gone, Happy the heart that sigh'd for such a one. SONNET. LII. [And whither (poore forsaken) wilt thou goe] At the Authors going into Italie. And whither (poore forsaken) wilt thou goe, To goe from sorrow, and thine owne distresse? When euery place presents like face of woe, And no remoue can make thy sorrowes lesse? Yet goe (forsaken) leaue these Woods, these plaines, Leaue her and all, and all for her that leaues Thee and thy Loue forlorne, and both disdaines: And of both, wrongfull deemes, and ill conceiues. Seeke out some place, and see if any place Can giue the least release vnto thy griefe: Conuay thee from the thought of thy disgrace, Steale from thy selfe, and be thy cares owne thiefe. But yet, what comforts shall I hereby gaine? Bearing the wound, I needes must feele the paine. SONNET. LIII. [Drawne with th'atractiue vertue of her eyes] This Sonnet was made at the Author's beeing in Italie. Drawne with th'atractiue vertue of her eyes, My toucht heart turnes it to that happy cost: My ioyfull North, where all my fortune lies, The leuell of my hopes desired most, There where my Delia fairer then the Sunne, Deckt with her youth whereon the world doth smile, Ioyes in that honor which her eyes haue wonne, Th'eternall wonder of our happy Ile. Florish faire Albion, glory of the North, Neptunes best darling, held betweene his armes: Diuided from the world, as better worth, Kept for himselfe, defended from all harmes. Still let disarmed peace decke her and thee: And Muse-foe Mars, abroad farre fostred bee. SONNET. LIIII. [Care-charmer Sleepe, sonne of the sable night] Care-charmer Sleepe, sonne of the sable night, Brother to death, in silent darknes borne: Relieue my languish, and restore the light With darke forgetting of my care returne. And let the day be time enough to mourne The shipwracke of my ill aduentred youth: Let waking eyes suffice to waile their scorne, Without the torment of the nights vntruth. Cease dreames, th'Images of day desires, To modell forth the passions of the morrow: Neuer let rising Sunne approue you liers, To adde more griefe to aggrauate my sorrow. Still let me sleepe, imbracing clouds in vaine, And neuer wake to feele the dayes disdaine. SONNET. LV. [Let others sing of Knights and Palladines] Let others sing of Knights and Palladines; In aged accents, and vntimely words: Paint shadowes in imaginary lines, VVhich well the reach of their high wits records; But I must sing of thee, and those faire eies, Autentique shall my verse in time to come, VVhen yet th'vnborne shall say, Lo where she lies, VVhose beauty made him speake that else was dombe. These are the Arkes, the Trophies I erect, That fortifie thy name against old age: And these thy sacred vertues must protect, Against the darke and times consuming rage. Though th'error of my youth in them appeare, Suffice, they shew I liu'd and lou'd thee deare. SONNET. LVI. [As to the Roman that would free his Land] As to the Roman that would free his Land, His error was his honour and renowne: And more the fame of his mistaking hand, Then if he had the tyrant ouer-throwne. So Delia, hath mine error made me knowne, And my deceiu'd attempt, deseru'd more fame; Then if I had the victory mine owne: And thy hard heart had yeelded vp the same. And so likewise, renowmed is thy blame, Thy cruelty, thy glory; O strange case That errors should be grac'd that merit shame, And sinne of frownes bring honour to the face. Yet happy Delia that thou wast vnkind, Though happier far if thou wouldst change thy mind. SONNET. LVII. [Like as the Lute delights or els dislikes] Like as the Lute delights or els dislikes, As is his art that playes vpon the same: So sounds my Muse according as she strikes On my heart-strings high tun'd vnto her fame. Her touch doth cause the warble of the sound, VVhich here I yeeld in lamentable wise: A wayling descant on the sweetest ground, VVhose due reports giue honor to her eyes. Else harsh my stile, vntunable my Muse, Hoarce sounds the voyce that prayseth not her name; If any pleasing relish here I vse, Then iudge the world her beauty giues the same. For no ground els could make the Musicke such, Nor other hand could giue so true a touch. SONNET. LVIII. [None other fame mine vnambitious Muse] None other fame mine vnambitious Muse, Affected euer, but t'eternize thee: All other honors doe my hopes refuse, Which meaner priz'd and momentary bee. For God forbid I should my Papers blot, With mercenary lines, with seruile Pen: Praising vertues in them that haue them not, Basely attending on the hopes of men. No, no, my Verse respects not Thames nor Theaters, Nor seekes it to be knowne vnto the Great, But Auon rich in fame, though poore in waters, Shall haue my Song, where Delia hath her seat: Auon shall be my Thames, and she my Song, No other prouder Brookes shall heare my wrong. SONNET. LIX. [Vnhappy Pen, and ill-accepted lines] Vnhappy Pen, and ill-accepted lines That intimate in vaine my chaste desire: My chaste desire, which from darke sorrow shines, Inkindled by her eyes celestiall fire. Celestiall fire, and vnrespecting powres Which pitty not the wounds made by their might, Shew'd in these lines, the worke of carefull houres, The sacrifice here offred to her sight. But since she weighs them not, this rests for me, Ile mone my selfe, and hide the wrong I haue: And so content me that her frownes should be To m'infant stile the Cradle, and the Graue. What though my Muse no honor get thereby, Each Bird sings to her selfe, and so will I. SONNET. LX. [Lo here the impost of a faith entire] Lo here the impost of a faith entire Which loue doth pay, and her disdaine extorts: Behold the message of a chast desire Which tells the world how much my griefe imports. These tributary passions, beauties due, I send those eyes the cabinets of loue: That Cruelty her selfe might grieue to view Th'affliction her vnkind disdaine doth moue. And how I liue cast downe from off all myrth, Pensiue alone, onely but with Dispaire: My ioyes abortiue, perish in their byrth. My griefes long liu'd, and care succeeding care. This is my state, and Delias heart is such, I say no more, I feare I sayd too much. III. THE COMPLAINT OF ROSAMOND. 1592. THE COMPLAINT OF Rosamond. Ovt from the horror of infernall deepes, My poore afflicted ghost comes here to plain it, Attended with my shame that neuer sleepes, The spot wherewith my kind, and youth did staine it. My body found a graue where to containe it: A sheete could hide my face, but not my sin, For Fame findes neuer Tombe t'inclose it in. And which is worse, my soule is now denied, Her transport to the sweet Elisian rest, The ioyfull blisse for Ghosts repurified, The euer-springing Gardens of the blest: Caron denies me waftage with the rest. And saies my soule can neuer passe the Riuer, Till Louers sighs on earth shall it deliuer. So shall I neuer passe; for how should I Procure this sacrifice amongst the liuing? Time hath long since worne out the memorie Both of my life, and liues vniust depriuing: Sorrow for me is dead for aye reuiuing. Rosamond hath little left her but her name, And that disgrac'd, for time hath wrong'd the same. No Muse suggests the pitty of my case, Each Pen doth ouerpasse my iust complaint, Whilst others are prefer'd, though farre more base; Shores wife is grac'd, and passes for a Saint; Her Legend iustifies her soule attaint. Her well-told tale did such compassion finde, That she is pass'd, and I am left behinde. Which seene with griefe, my miserable Ghost, (Whilome inuested in so faire a vaile, Which whilst it liu'd, was honoured of the most, And being dead, giues matter to bewaile,) Comes to sollicite thee, (whilst others faile) To take this taske, and in thy wofull song To forme my case, and register my wrong. Although I know thy iust lamenting Muse, Toill'd in th'affliction of thine owne distresse, In others cares hath little time to vse, And therefore maist esteeme of mine the lesse: Yet as thy hopes attend happy redresse, The ioyes depending on a womans grace, So moue thy minde a wofull womans case. Delia may hap to deigne to reade our Story, And offer vp her sighs among the rest, Whose merit would suffice for both our glory, Whereby thou might'st be grac'd and I be blest; That indulgence would profit me the best. Such powre she hath by whom thy youth is led, To ioy the liuing, and to blesse the dead. So I (through beauty) made the wofull'st wight, By beauty might haue comfort after death: That dying fairest, by the fairest might Finde life aboue on earth, and rest beneath. She that can blesse vs with one happy breath, Giue comfort to thy Muse to doe her best, That thereby thou mayst ioy, and I might rest. Thus said: forthwith mou'd with a tender care, And pitty (which my selfe could neuer find,) What she desir'd, my Muse deign'd to declare, And therefore, will'd her boldly tell her mind. And I (more willing) tooke this charge assign'd, Because her griefes were worthy to be knowne, And telling hers, might hap forget mine owne. Then write (quoth she) the ruine of my youth, Report the downe-fall of my slippry state: Of all my life reueale the simple truth, To teach to others what I learnt too late. Exemplifie my frailtie, tell how Fate Keepes in eternall darke our fortunes hidden, And ere they come to know them tis forbidden. For whilst the Sun-shine of my fortune lasted, I ioy'd the happiest warmth, the sweetest heate That euer yet imperious beauty tasted, I had what glory euer flesh could get: But this faire morning had a shamefull set. Disgrace dark'd honour, sinne did cloude my brow, As note the sequell, and Ile tell thee how. The bloud I stain'd, was good and of the best, My birth had honour, and my beauty fame: Nature and Fortune ioyn'd to make me blest. Had I had grace t'haue knowne to vse the same. My education shew'd from whence I came, And all concurr'd to make me happy furst, That so great hope might make me more accurst. Happy liu'd I whilst parents eye did guide The indiscretion of my feeble wayes, And Countrey-home kept me from being eide, Where best vnknowne I spent my sweetest daies: Till that my friends mine honour sought to raise To higher place, which greater credit yeelds, Deeming such beauty was vnfit for fields. From Countrey then to Court I was prefer'd From calme to stormes, from shore into the deepes: There where I perish'd, where my youth first err'd, There where I lost the floure which honour keepes, There where the worser thriues, the better weepes; Ah me (poore wench) on this vnhappy shelfe, I grounded me, and cast away my selfe. There whereas fraile and tender beauty stands, With all assaulting powres inuironed; Hauing but prayers and weake feeble hands To hold their honours Fort vnuanquished; There where to stand, and be vnconquered, Is to b'aboue the nature of our kinde, That cannot long for pitty be vnkinde. For thither com'd, when yeeres had arm'd my youth, With rarest proofe of beauty euer seene: When my reuiuing eie had learnt the truth, That it had powre to make the winter greene, And floure affections whereas none had beene; Soone could I teach my brow to tyrannize, And make the world doe homage to mine eyes. For age I saw (though yeeres with cold conceit, Congeal'd their thoughts against a warme desire,) Yet sigh their want, and looke at such a baite; I saw how youth was waxe before the fire; I saw by stealth, I fram'd my looke a lyre. Yet well perceiu'd, how Fortune made me then The enuie of my sexe, and wonder vnto men. Looke how a Comet at the first appearing, Drawes all mens eyes with wonder to behold it; Or as the saddest tale at sudden hearing, Makes silent listning vnto him that told it, So did my speech when Rubies did vnfold it; So did the blazing of my blush appeare, T'amaze the world, that holdes such sights so deere. Ah beauty Syren, faire enchaunting good, Sweet silent Rhetorique of perswading eyes: Dombe Eloquence, whose powre doth moue the bloud, More then the words or wisedome of the wise; Still harmony, whose Diapason lyes Within a brow, the key which passions moue, To rauish sence, and play a world in loue. What might I then not doe whose powre was such? What cannot women doe that know their powre? What women knowes it not (I feare too much) How blisse or bale lyes in their laugh or lowre? Whilst they inioy their happy blooming flowre, Whilst Nature decks them in their best attires Of youth and beauty, which the world admires. Such one was I, my beauty was mine owne, No borrowed blush which bank-rot beauties seeke: That new-found shame, a sinne to vs vnknowne, Th'adulterate beauty of a falsed cheeke: Vilde staine to honour, and to women eeke, Seeing that time our fading must detect, Thus with defect to couer our defect. Impietie of times, Chastities abator, Falshood, wherein thy selfe thy selfe deniest: Treason to counterfeit the seale of Nature, The stampe of heauen, impressed by the highest. Disgrace vnto the world, to whom thou liest, Idoll vnto thy selfe, shame to the wise, And all that honour thee Idolatrise. Farre was that sinne from vs whose age was pure, VVhen simple beauty was accounted best, The time when women had no other lure But modestie, pure cheekes, a vertuous brest: This was the pompe wherewith my youth was blest. These were the weapons which mine honour wonne, In all the conflicts which mine eyes begunne. VVhich were not small; I wrought on no meane obiect, A Crowne was at my feete, Scepters obey'd me: VVhom Fortune made my King, Loue made my Subiect, VVho did command the Land, most humbly pray'd me: Henry the second, that so highly weigh'd me, Found well (by proofe) the priuiledge of beauty, That it had powre to counter-maund all duty. For after all his victories in France, And all the triumphs of his honour wonne: Vnmatcht by sword, was vanquisht by a glance, And hotter warres within his breast begunne. VVarres, whom whole legions of desires drew on: Against all which, my chastitie contends, VVith force of honour, which my shame defends. No Armour might be found that could defend, Transpearcing raies of cristall poynted eyes: No stratagem, no reason could amend, No not his age; (yet old men should be wise) But shewes deceiue, outward appearance lies. Let none for seeming so, thinke Saints of others, For all are men, and all haue suckt their mothers. VVho would haue thought a Monarch would haue euer Obey'd his hand-maide of so meane estate; Vulture ambition feeding on his liuer, Age hauing worne his pleasures out of date. But hap comes neuer, or it comes too late, For such a dainty which his youth found not, Vnto his feeble age did chaunce allot. Ah Fortune, neuer absolutely good, For that some crosse still counter-checks our lucke; As here behold th'incompatible blood, Of age and youth was that whereon we stucke: VVhose lothing, we from Natures breasts doe sucke, As opposite to what our bloud requires; For equall age, doth equall like desires. But mighty men, in highest honour sitting, Nought but applause and pleasure can behold: Sooth'd in their liking, carelesse what is fitting, May not be suffred once to thinke the'are old: Not trusting what they see, but what is told. Miserable fortune to forget so farre The state of flesh, and what our frailties are. Yet must I needs excuse so great defect; For drinking of the Lethe of mine eies, H'is forc'd forget himselfe, and all respect Of maiesty, whereon his state relies: And now of loues and pleasures must deuise. For thus reuiu'd againe, he serues and su'th, And seekes all meanes to vndermine my youth. Which neuer by assault he could recouer, So well incamp'd in strength of chaste desires: My cleane-arm'd thoughts repell'd an vnchaste louer. The Crowne that could command what it requires, I lesser priz'd then Chastities attires. Th'vnstained vaile, which innocents adornes, Th'vngathred Rose, defended with the thornes. And safe mine honor stood, till that in truth, One of my Sexe, of place and nature bad, Was set in ambush to intrap my youth. One in the habit of like frailtie clad, One who the liu'ry of like weakenesse had. A seeming Matron, yet a sinfull Monster, As by her words the Chaster sort may conster. She set vpon me with the smoothest speech That Court and age could cunningly deuise: Th'one authentique, made her fit to teach, The other learn'd her how to subtilise. Both were enough to circumuent the wise. A document that well might teach the sage, That there's no trust in youth, nor hope in age. Daughter (said she) behold thy happy chance, That hast the lot cast downe into thy lap, Whereby thou may'st thy honor great aduance, Whilst thou (vnhappy) wilt not see thy hap: Such fond respect thy youth doth so inwrap, T'oppose thy selfe against thine owne good fortune, That poynts thee out, and seemes thee to importune. Doost thou not see, how that thy King (thy Ioue) Lightens forth glory on thy darke estate: And showers downe gold and treasure from aboue, Whilst thou doost shut thy lap against thy Fate? Fie Fondling fie, thou wilt repent too late The error of thy youth; that canst not see What is the Fortune that doth follow thee. Thou must not thinke thy flower can alwayes flourish, And that thy beauty will be still admired; But that those raies which all these flames doe nourish, Cancell'd with Time, will haue their date expired, And men will scorne what now is so desired. Our frailties doome is written in the flowers, Which flourish now, and fade ere many howers. Reade in my face the ruines of my youth, The wracke of yeeres vpon my aged brow; I haue beene faire (I must confesse the truth) And stood vpon as nice respects as thou; I lost my time, and I repent it now. But were I to beginne my youth againe, I would redeeme the time I spent in vaine. But thou hast yeeres and priuiledge to vse them, Thy priuiledge doth beare Beauties great seale; Besides, the Law of Nature doth excuse them, To whom thy youth may haue a iust appeale. Esteeme not Fame more then thou dost thy weale. Fame (whereof the world seemes to make such choice) Is but an Eccho, and an idle voice. Then why should this respect of honor bound vs, In th'imaginarie lists of Reputation? Titles which cold seueritie hath found vs, Breath of the vulgar, foe to recreation: Melancholies opinion, Customes relation; Pleasures plague, beauties scourge, hell to the faire, To leaue the sweet for Castles in the aire. Pleasure is felt, opinion but conceau'd, Honor, a thing without vs, not our owne: Whereof we see how many are bereau'd, Which should haue reap'd the glory they had sowne: And many haue it, yet vnworthy, knowne. So breathes his blast this many-headed beast, Whereof the wisest haue esteemed least. The subtill City-women, better learned, Esteeme them chaste enough that best seeme so: Who though they sport, it shall not be discerned, Their face bewraies not what their bodies do; Tis warie walking that doth saflyest go, With shew of Vertue, as the cunning knowes: Babes are beguild with sweets, and men with showes. Then vse thy tallent, youth shall be thy warrant, And let not honor from thy sports detract: Thou must not fondly thinke thy selfe transparant, That those who see thy face can iudge thy fact; Let her haue shame that cannot closely act. And seeme the chaste, which is the chiefest arte, For what we seeme each sees, none knowes our hart. The mightie who can with such sinnes dispence, In steed of shame doe honors great bestow, A worthie author doth redeeme th'offence, And makes the scarlet sinne as white as snow. The Maiestie that doth descend so low, Is not defilde, but pure remaines therein: And being sacred, sanctifies the sin. What, doost thou stand on this, that he is old? Thy beautie hath the more to worke vpon; Thy pleasures want shall be supplide with gold, Cold age dotes most when heate of youth is gone: Enticing words preuaile with such a one. Alluring shewes most deepe impression strikes, For age is prone to credit what it likes. Here interrupt, she leaues me in a doubt, When loe beganne the cumbat in my blood: Seeing my youth inuiron'd round about, The ground vncertaine where my reasons stood; Small my defence to make my party good, Against such powers which were so surely laid, To ouerthrow a poore vnskilfull Maide. Treason was in my bones, my selfe conspiring, To sell my selfe to lust, my soule to sin: Pure-blushing shame was euen in retiring, Leauing the sacred hold it glori'd in. Honor lay prostrate for my flesh to win, When cleaner thoughts my weakenesse gan vpbray Against my selfe, and shame did force me say; Ah Rosamond, what doth thy flesh prepare? Destruction to thy dayes, death to thy fame: Wilt thou betray that honor held with care, T'entombe with blacke reproch a spotted name? Leauing thy blush the colours of thy shame? Opening thy feete to sinne, thy soule to lust, Gracelesse to lay thy glory in the dust? Nay first let th'earth gape wide to swallow thee, And shut thee vp in bosome with her dead, Ere Serpent tempt thee taste forbidden Tree, Or feele the warmth of an vnlawfull bed; Suffring thy selfe by lust to be misled; So to disgrace thy selfe and grieue thine heires, That Cliffords race should scorne thee one of theirs. Neuer wish longer to enioy the Aire, Then that thou breath'st the breath of Chastitie: Longer then thou preseru'st thy soule as faire As is thy face, free from impuritie. Thy face, that makes th'admir'd in euery eie, Where Natures care such rarities inroule; Which vs'd amisse, may serue to damne thy soule. But what? he is my King, and may constraine me, Whether I yeeld or not, I liue defamed. The World will thinke Authoritie did gaine me, I shall be iudg'd his Loue, and so be shamed: We see the faire condemn'd, that neuer gamed. And if I yeeld, tis honorable shame, If not, I liue disgrac'd, yet thought the same. What way is left thee then (vnhappy Maide) Whereby thy spotlesse foote may wander out This dreadfull danger, which thou seest is laide, Wherein thy shame doth compasse thee about? Thy simple yeeres cannot resolue this doubt. Thy Youth can neuer guide thy foote so euen, But (in despite) some scandall will be giuen. Thus stood I ballanc'd equally precize, Till my fraile flesh did weigh me downe to sin; Till world and pleasure made me partialize, And glittering pompe my vanitie did win, When to excuse my fault my lusts begin. And impious thoughts alledg'd this wanton clause, That though I sinn'd, my sinne had honest cause. So well the golden balles cast downe before me, Could entertaine my course, hinder my way: Whereat my wretchlesse youth stooping to store me, Lost me the Goale, the Glory and the Day. Pleasure had set my well school'd thoughts to play, And bade me vse the vertue of mine eies, For sweetly it fits the faire to wantonise. Thus wrought to sinne, soone was I train'd from Court, T'a sollitarie Grange, there to attend The time the King should thither make resort, Where he Loues long-desired worke should end. Thither he daily messages doth send, With costly Iewels (Orators of Loue,) Which (ah, too well men know) doe women moue. The day before the night of my defeature, He greetes me with a Casket richly wrought; So rare, that Arte did seeme to striue with Nature, T'expresse the cunning Worke-mans curious thought; The mysterie whereof I prying sought, And found engrauen on the lid aboue, Amymone, how she with Neptune stroue. Amymone, old Danaus fairest Daughter, As she was fetching water all alone At Lerna: whereas Neptune came and caught her: From whom she striu'd and struggled to be gone, Beating the aire with cries and piteous mone; But all in vaine, with him she's forc'd to go; Tis shame that men should vse poore maidens so. There might I see described how she lay, At those proude feete, not satisfied with prayer: Wayling her heauy hap, cursing the day, In act so pitious to expresse despaire. And by how much more grieu'd, so much more faire. Her teares vpon her cheekes (poore carefull Gerle,) Did seeme against the Sunne Christall and Pearle: Whose pure cleere streames (which lo so faire appeares) Wrought hotter flames (O miracle of Loue That kindles fire in water, heate in teares, And makes neglected beauty mightier proue, Teaching afflicted eyes affects to moue;) To shew that nothing ill becomes the faire, But cruelty, which yeelds vnto no prayer. This hauing view'd, and therewith something moued, Figured I finde within the other squares, Transformed Io, Ioues deerely loued, In her affliction how she strangely fares. Strangely distress'd (O beauty, borne to cares) Turn'd to a Heiffer, kept with iealous eyes, Alwayes in danger of her hatefull spies. These presidents presented to my view, Wherein the presage of my fall was showne, Might haue fore-warn'd me well what would ensue, And others harmes haue made me shun mine owne. But Fate is not preuented, though foreknowne. For that must hap, decreed by heauenly powers, Who worke our fall, yet make the fault still ours. Witnesse the world, wherein is nothing riser, Then miseries vnken'd before they come: Who can the Characters of chaunce decipher, Written in cloudes of our concealed dome? Which though perhaps haue beene reueal'd to some, Yet that so doubtfull (as successe did proue them) That men must know they haue the Heau'ns aboue them. I saw the sinne wherein my foote was entring, I saw how that dishonour did attend it, I saw the shame whereon my flesh was ventring, Yet had I not the power for to defend it. So weake is sence, when error hath condemn'd it. We see what's good, and thereto we consent, But yet we choose the worst, and soone repent. And now I come to tell the worst of ilnesse, Now drawes the date of mine affliction neere. Now when the darke had wrapt vp all in stilnesse, And dreadfull blacke had dispossest the cleere, Com'd was the Night (mother of sleepe and feare) Who with her sable-mantle friendly couers The sweet-stolne sport of ioyfull meeting Louers. When lo, I ioy'd my Louer, not my Loue, And felt the hand of lust most vndesired: Enforc'd th'vnprooued bitter sweet to proue, Which yeeldes no naturall pleasure when tis hired. Loue's not constrain'd, nor yet of due required. Iudge they who are vnfortunately wed, What tis to come vnto a loathed bed. But soone his age receiu'd his short contenting, And sleepe seal'd vp his languishing desires: When he turnes to his rest, I to repenting, Into my selfe my waking thought retires: My nakednesse had prou'd my sences liers. Now opned were mine eyes to looke therein; For first we taste the fruit, then see our sin. Now did I finde my selfe vnparadis'd, From those pure fields of my so cleane beginning: Now I perceiu'd how ill I was aduis'd, My flesh gan loathe the new-felt touch of sinning; Shame leaues vs by degrees, not at first winning. For Nature checks a new offence with loathing, But vse of sinne doth make it seeme as nothing. And vse of sinne did worke in me a boldnesse, And loue in him, incorporates such zeale, That iealousie increas'd with ages coldnesse, Fearing to loose the ioy of all his weale; Or doubting time his stealth might else reueale, H'is driuen to deuise some subtill way, How he might safelyest keepe so rich a pray. A stately Pallace he forthwith did build, Whose intricate innumerable wayes With such confused errours, so beguilde Th'vnguided Entrers, with vncertaine strayes, And doubtfull turnings, kept them in delayes; With bootelesse labor leading them about, Able to finde no way, nor in, nor out. Within the closed bosome of which frame, That seru'd a Centre to that goodly Round, Were lodgings, with a Garden to the same, With sweetest flowers that eu'r adorn'd the ground, And all the pleasures that delight hath found, T'entertaine the sense of wanton eies; Fuell of Loue, from whence lusts flames arise. Here I inclos'd from all the world asunder, The Minotaure of shame kept for disgrace, The Monster of Fortune, and the worlds wonder, Liu'd cloistred in so desolate a case: None but the King might come into the place, With certaine Maides that did attend my neede, And he himselfe came guided by a threed. O Iealousie, daughter of Enuie and Loue, Most wayward issue of a gentle Sire; Fostred with feares, thy fathers ioyes t'improue, Mirth-marring Monster, borne a subtill lier; Hatefull vnto thy selfe, flying thine owne desire: Feeding vpon suspect that doth renue thee, Happy were Louers if they neuer knew thee. Thou hast a thousand Gates thou enterest by, Condemning trembling passions to our hart; Hundred ey'd Argus, euer waking Spie, Pale Hagge, infernall Furie, pleasures smart, Enuious Obseruer, prying in euery part; Suspicious, fearefull, gazing still about thee, O would to God that loue could be without thee. Thou didst depriue (through false suggesting feare) Him of content, and me of libertie: The onely good that women hold so deere, And turnst my freedome to captiuitie, First made a prisoner, ere an enemie. Enioyn'd the ransome of my bodies shame, Which though I paid, could not redeeme the same. What greater torment euer could haue beene, Then to inforce the faire to liue retir'd? For what is beauty if it bee not seene? Or what is't to be seene if not admir'd? And though admir'd, vnlesse in loue desir'd? Neuer were cheekes of Roses, locks of Amber, Ordain'd to liue imprison'd in a Chamber. Nature created beauty for the view, (Like as the Fire for heate, the Sunne for light:) Thy faire doe hold this priuiledge as due By ancient Charter, to liue most in sight, And she that is debar'd it, hath not right. In vaine our friends from this, doe vs dehort, For Beauty will be where is most resort. Witnesse the fairest streetes that Thames doth visit, The wondrous concourse of the glittring Faire: For what rare woman deckt with beauty is it, That thither couets not to make repaire? The sollitary Countrey may not stay her. Here is the centre of all beauties best, Excepting Delia, left t'adorne the West. Here doth the curious with iudiciall eies, Contemplate Beauty gloriously attired: And herein all our chiefest glory lies, To liue where we are prais'd and most desired. O how we ioy to see our selues admired, Whilst niggardly our fauours we discouer: We loue to be belou'd, yet scorne the Louer. Yet would to God my foote had neuer mou'd From Countrey-safety, from the fields of rest: To know the danger to be highly lou'd, And liue in pompe to braue among the best: Happy for me, better had I beene blest, If I vnluckily had neuer straide, But liu'd at home a happy Countrey Maide. Whose vnaffected innocencie thinkes No guilefull fraude, as doth the Courtly liuer: Shee's deckt with truth; the Riuer where she drinkes Doth serue her for her glasse, her Counsell-giuer; She loues sincerely, and is loued euer. Her dayes are peace, and so she endes her breath; (True life that knowes not what's to die till death.) So should I neuer haue beene registred, In the blacke booke of the vnfortunate: Nor had my name inrol'd with maides misled, Which bought their pleasures at so hie a rate. Nor had I taught, (through my vnhapy fate) This Lesson (which my selfe learn't with expence) How most it hurts, that most delights the sence. Shame followes sinne, disgrace is duely giuen, Impietie will out, neuer so closely done: No walles can hide vs from the eye of Heauen, For shame must end what wickednesse begun; Forth breakes reproch when we least thinke thereon, And this is euer proper vnto Courts, That nothing can be done, but Fame reports. Fame doth explore what lies most secret hidden, Entring the Closet of the Pallace dweller: Abroade reuealing what is most forbidden. Of truth and falshood both an equall teller, Tis not a guard can serue for to expell her. The Sword of Iustice cannot cut her Wings, Nor stop her mouth from vtt'ring secret things. And this our stealth she could not long conceale, From her whom such a forfeit most concerned: The wronged Queene, who could so closely deale, That she the whole of all our practise learned, And watcht a time when least it was discerned, In absence of the King to wreake her wrong, With such reuenge as she desired long. The Labyrinth she entred by that Threed, That seru'd a conduct to my absent Lord, Left there by chance, reseru'd for such a deed, Where she surpriz'd me whom she so abhor'd. Enrag'd with madnesse, scarce she speakes a word, But flies with eager furie to my face, Offring me most vnwomanly disgrace. Looke how a Tygresse that hath lost her Whelpe, Runnes fiercely ranging through the Woods astray: And seeing her selfe depriu'd of hope or helpe, Furiously assaults what's in her way, To satisfie her wrath, (not for a pray) So fell she on me in outragious wise, As could Disdaine and Iealousie deuise. And after all her vile reproches vsde, She forc'd me take the Poyson she had brought, To end the life that had her so abusde, And free her feares, and ease her iealous thought. No cruelty her wrath could leaue vnwrought, No spitefull act that to Reuenge is common; (No beast being fiercer then a iealous woman.) Here take (saith she) thou impudent vncleane, Base gracelesse Strumpet, take this next your heart; Your Love-sicke heart, that ouer-charg'd hath beene With Pleasures surfeit, must be purg'd with Art. This potion hath a power that will conuart To naught, those humors that oppresse you so. And (Gerle) Ile see you take it ere I go. What, stand you now amaz'd, retire you backe? Tremble you (Minion?) come, dispatch with speed; There is no helpe, your Champion now you lacke, And all these teares you shed will nothing steed; Those dainty fingers needes must doe the deed. Take it, or I will drench you else by force, And trifle not, lest that I vse you worse. Hauing this bloody doome from hellish breath, My wofull eyes on euery side I cast: Rigor about me, in my hand my death, Presenting me the horror of my last: All hope of pitty and of comfort past. No meanes, no power; no forces to contend, My trembling hands must giue my selfe my end. Those hands that beauties ministers had bin, They must giue death, that me adorn'd of late, That mouth that newly gaue consent to sin, Must now receiue destruction in thereat, That body which my lust did violate, Must sacrifice it selfe t'appease the wrong. (So short is pleasure, glory lasts not long.) And she no sooner saw I had it taken, But forth she rushes (proud with victorie) And leaues m'alone, of all the world forsaken, Except of Death, which she had left with me. (Death and my selfe alone together be.) To whom she did her full reuenge refer. Oh poore weake conquest both for him and her. Then straight my Conscience summons vp my sinne, T'appeare before me in a hideous face; Now doth the terror of my soule beginne, When eu'ry corner of that hatefull place Dictates mine error, and reueales disgrace; Whilst I remaine opprest in euery part, Death in my body, Horror at my hart. Downe on my bed my loathsome selfe I cast, The bed that likewise giues in euidence Against my soule, and tels I was vnchast; Tels I was wanton, tels I followed sence, And therefore cast, by guilt of mine offence; Must here the right of Heauen needes satisfie, And where I wanton lay, must wretched die. Here I beganne to waile my hard mishap, My sudden, strange vnlookt for misery, Accusing them that did my youth intrap, To giue me such a fall of infamy. And poore distressed Rosamond (said I) Is this thy glory got, to die forlorne In Desarts where no eare can heare thee mourne? Nor any eye of pitty to behold The wofull end of my sad tragedie; But that thy wrongs vnseene, thy tale vntold, Must here in secret silence buried lie. And with thee, thine excuse together die. Thy sinne reueal'd, but thy repentance hid, Thy shame aliue, but dead what thy death did. Yet breathe out to these Walles the breath of mone, Tell th'Aaire thy plaints, since men thou canst not tell. And though thou perish desolate alone, Tell yet thy selfe, what thy selfe knowes too well: Vtter thy griefe wherewith thy soule doth swell. And let thy heart pitty thy hearts remorse, And be thy selfe the mourner and the corse. Condole thee here, clad all in blacke dispaire, With silence onely, and a dying bed; Thou that of late, so flourishing, so faire, Did'st glorious liue, admir'd and honored: And now from friends, from succour hither led, Art made a spoyle to lust, to wrath, to death, And in disgrace, forc'd here to yeeld thy breath. Did Nature (for this good) ingeniate, To shew in thee the glory of her best; Framing thine eye the starre of thy ill fate, Making thy face the foe to spoyle the rest? O Beautie thou an enemie profest To Chastitie and vs that loue thee most, Without thee, how w'are loath'd, and with thee lost? You, you that proude with libertie and beautie, (And well may you be proude that you be so) Glitter in Court, lou'd and obseru'd of dutie; Would God I might to you but ere I goe Speake what I feele, to warne you by my woe, To keepe your feete in cleanly paths of shame, That no inticing may diuert the same. See'ng how against your tender weakenesse still, The strength of wit, and gold, and all is bent; And all th'assaults that euer might or skill, Can giue against a chaste and cleane intent: Ah let not greatnesse worke you to consent. The spot is foule, though by a Monarch made, Kings cannot priuiledge what God forbade. Locke vp therefore the treasure of your loue, Vnder the surest keyes of feare and shame: And let no powers haue power chaste thoughts to moue To make a lawlesse entry on your fame. Open to those the comfort of your flame, Whose equall loue shall march with equall pace, In those pure wayes that leade to no disgrace. For see how many discontented beds, Our owne aspiring, or our Parents pride Haue caus'd, whilst that ambition vainely weds Wealth and not loue, honor and nought beside: Whilst married but to titles, we abide As wedded Widowes, wanting what we haue, When shadowes cannot giue vs what we craue. Or whilst we spend the freshest of our time, The sweet of youth in plotting in the ayre; Alas, how oft we fall, hoping to clime; Or whither as vnprofitably faire, Whilst those decayes which are without repaire, Make vs neglected, scorned and reprou'd. (And O what are we, if we be not lou'd?) Fasten therefore vpon occasions fit, Lest this, or that, or like disgrace as mine, Doe ouer-take your youth or ruine it, And cloude with infamie your beauties shine: Seeing how many seeke to vndermine The treasurie that's vnpossest of any: And hard tis kept that is desired of many. And flie (O flie) these Bed-brokers vncleane, (The Monsters of our Sexe) that make a pray Of their owne kinde, by an vnkindely meane; And euen (like Vipers) eating out a way Through th'wombe of their owne shame, accursed they Liue by the death of Fame, the gaine of sin, The filth of lust, vncleannesse wallowes in. As if t'were not inough that we (poore we) Haue weakenesse, beautie, gold and men our foes, But we must haue some of our selues to be Traitors vnto our selues, to ioyne with those? Such as our feeble forces doe disclose, And still betray our cause, our shame, our youth, To lust, to folly, and to mens vntruth? Hatefull confounders both of bloud and lawes, Vilde Orators of shame, that pleade delight: Vngracious agents in a wicked cause, Factors for darkenesse, messengers of night, Serpents of guile, Deuils, that doe inuite The wanton taste of that forbidden tree, Whose fruit once pluckt, will shew how foule we bee. You in the habite of a graue aspect, (In credit by the trust of yeeres) can shoe The cunning wayes of lust, and can direct The faire and wilie wantons how to goe, Hauing (your lothesome selues) your youth spent so. And in vncleannesse euer haue beene fed, By the reuenue of a wanton bed. By you haue beene the innocent betraide, The blushing fearefull, boldned vnto sin, The wife made subtill, subtill made the maide, The husband scorn'd, dishonored the kin: Parents disgrac'd, children infamous bin. Confus'd our race, and falsified our blood, Whilst fathers sonnes possesse wrong fathers good. This, and much more, I would haue vttered then, A testament to be recorded still, Sign'd with my bloud, subscrib'd with Conscience Pen, To warne the faire and beautifull from ill. Though I could wish (by th'example of my will) I had not left this note vnto the faire, But dide intestate to haue had no heire. But now, the poyson spread through all my vaines, Gan dispossesse my liuing sences quite: And nought-respecting death (the last of paines) Plac'd his pale colours (th'ensigne of his might) Vpon his new-got spoyle before his right; Thence chac'd my soule, setting my day ere noone, When I least thought my ioyes could end so soone. And as conuaide t'vntimely funerals, My scarce cold corse not suffred longer stay, Behold, the King (by chance) returning, fals T'incounter with the same vpon the way, As he repair'd to see his dearest ioy. Not thinking such a meeting could haue beene, To see his Loue, and seeing bin vnseene. Iudge those whom chance depriues of sweetest treasure, What tis to lose a thing we hold so deere: The best delight, wherein our soule takes pleasure, The sweet of life, that penetrates so neere. What passions feeles that heart, inforc'd to beare The deepe impression of so strange a sight, That ouerwhelmes vs, or confounds vs quite? Amaz'd he stands, nor voice nor body steares, Words had no passage, teares no issue found, For sorrow shut vp words, wrath kept in teares; Confus'd affects each other doe confound. Opprest with griefe, his passions had no bound: Striuing to tell his woes, words would not come; For light cares speake, when mightie griefes are dombe. At length, extremitie breakes out a way, Through which, th'imprisoned voice with teares attended, Wailes out a sound that sorrowes doe bewray: With armes a-crosse, and eyes to heauen bended, Vaporing out sighs that to the skies ascended. Sighs (the poore ease calamitie affords) Which serue for speech when sorrow wanteth words. O Heauens (quoth he) why doe mine eyes behold The hatefull raies of this vnhappy Sunne? Why haue I light to see my sinnes controld, With bloud of mine owne shame thus vildely done? How can my sight endure to looke thereon? Why doth not blacke eternall darkenesse hide, That from mine eyes, my heart cannot abide? What saw my life wherein my soule might ioy; What had my dayes whom troubles still afflicted, But onely this, to counterpoize annoy? This ioy, this hope, which Death hath interdicted; This sweet, whose losse hath all distresse inflicted; This, that did season all my sowre of life, Vext still at home with broiles, abroade in strife. Vext still at home with broiles, abroade in strife, Dissension in my bloud, iarres in my bed: Distrust at boord, suspecting still my life, Spending the night in horror, daies in dread; (Such life hath Tyrants, and this life I led.) These miseries goe mask'd in glittering showes, Which wise men see, the vulgar little knowes. Thus as these passions doe him ouerwhelme, He drawes him neere my body to behold it. And as the Vine married vnto the Elme With strict imbraces, so doth he infold it: And as he in his carefull armes doth hold it, Viewing the face that euen death commends, On sencelesse lippes, millions of kisses spends. Pittifull mouth (saith he) that liuing gauest The sweetest comfort that my soule could wish: O be it lawfull now, that dead thou hauest, This sorrowing farewell of a dying kisse; And you faire eyes, containers of my blisse, Motiues of Loue, borne to be matched neuer, Entomb'd in your sweet circles, sleepe for euer. Ah, how me thinkes I see Death dallying seekes, To entertaine it selfe in Loues sweet place; Decayed Roses of discoloured cheekes, Doe yet retaine deere notes of former grace: And vgly Death sits faire within her face; Sweet remnants resting of Vermillian red, That Death it selfe doubts whether she be dead. Wonder of beautie, oh receiue these plaints, These obsequies, the last that I shall make thee: For loe, my soule that now already faints, (That lou'd thee liuing, dead will not forsake thee) Hastens her speedy course to ouer-take thee. Ile meete my death, and free my selfe thereby, For (ah) what can he doe that cannot die? Yet ere I die, thus much my soule doth vow, Reuenge shall sweeten death with ease of minde: And I will cause Posterity shall know, How faire thou wert about all women kinde; And after-Ages Monuments shall finde, Shewing thy beauties title, not thy name, Rose of the world, that sweetned so the same. This said, though more desirous yet to say, (For sorrow is vnwilling to giue ouer) He doth represse what griefe would else bewray, Lest he too much his passions should discouer; And yet respect scarce bridles such a Louer, So farre transported that he knowes not whither, For Loue and Maiestie dwell ill togither. Then were my Funerals not long deferred, But done with all the rites pompe could deuise, At Godstow, where my body was interred, And richly tomb'd in honorable wise: Where yet as now scarce any note descries Vnto these times, the memory of me, Marble and Brasse so little lasting be. For those walles which the credulous deuout, And apt-beleeuing ignorant did found; With willing zeale, that neuer call'd in doubt, That time their workes should euer so consound, Lie like confused heapes as vnder-ground. And what their ignorance esteem'd so holy, The wiser ages doe account as folly. And were it not thy fauourable lines Re-edified the wracke of my decayes, And that thy accents willingly assignes Some farther date, and giue me longer daies, Few in this age had knowne my beauties praise. But thus renew'd, my fame redeemes some time, Till other ages shall neglect thy Rime. Then when Confusion in her course shall bring Sad desolation on the times to come: When mirthlesse Thames shall haue no Swanne to sing, All Musicke silent, and the Muses dombe. And yet euen then it must be knowne to some, That once they flourisht, though not cherisht so, And Thames had Swannes as well as euer Po. But here an end, I may no longer stay, I must returne t'attend at Stygian flood: Yet ere I goe, this one word more I pray, Tell Delia, now her sigh may doe me good, And will her note the frailtie of our blood. And if I passe vnto those happy bankes, Then she must haue her praise, thy Pen her thankes. So vanisht she, and left me to returne To prosecute the tenor of my woes, Eternall matter for my Muse to mourne: But (yet) the world hath heard too much of those, My youth such errors must no more disclose. Ile hide the rest, and grieue for what hath beene; Who made me knowne, must make me liue vnseene. FINIS. IV. A LETTER FROM OCTAUIA TO MARCUS ANTONIUS. 1599. To the right Honourable and most vertuous Lady, the Lady Margaret Countesse of Cumberland. Although the meaner sort (whose thoughts are plac'd As in another Region, farre below The sphere of greatnesse) cannot rightly taste What touch it hath, nor right her passions know: Yet haue I here aduentur'd to bestow Words vpon griefe, as my griefes comprehend; And made this great afflicted Lady show, Out of my feelings, what she might haue pend. And here the same, I bring forth, to attend Vpon thy reuerent name, to liue with thee Most vertuous Lady, that vouchsaf'st to lend Eare to my notes, and comfort vnto mee, That one day may thine owne faire vertues spread, B'ing Secretary now but to the dead. A Letter sent from Octauia to her husband Marcus Antonius into Ægypt. The Argument. Vpon the second agreement (the first being broken through iealousie of a disproportion of eminencie) betweene the Triumuiri Octauius Cæsar, Marcus Antonius, &amp; Lepidus: Octauia the sister of Octauius Cæsar, was maried to Antonius, as a lincke to combine that which nere yet, the greatest strength of Nature, or any power of nearest respect could long hold together, who made but the instrument of others ends, and deliuered vp as an Ostage, to serue the opportunity of aduantages, met not with that integrity she brought: but as highly preferred to affliction, encountred with all the grieuances that beate vpon the misery of greatnesse, exposed to stand betwixt the diuerse tending humours of vnquiet parties. For Antonie hauing yet vpon him the fetters of Ægypt, layd on by the power of a most incomparable beauty, could admit no new Lawes into the state of his affection, or dispose of himselfe, being not himselfe, but as hauing his heart turned Eastward, whither the poynt of his desires were directed, toucht with the strongest allurements that ambition, and a licentious soueraignty could draw a man vnto: could not truly descend to the priuate loue of a ciuill nurtred Matron, whose entertainment bounded with modesty, and the nature of her education, knew not to clothe her affections in any other colours, then the plaine habit of truth! wherein she euer suted all her actions, and vsed all her best ornaments of Honestie, to winne the good liking of him that held her, but as a Curtaine, drawne betweene him and Octauius, to shadow his other purposes withall: which the sharpe sight of an equally iealous ambition could soone pierce into, and as easily looke thorow, and ouer bloud and nature, as he to abuse it: and therefore, to preuent his aspiring, he armes his forces, either to reduce Antonie to the ranke of his estate, or else to disranke him out of state and all. When Octauia by the imployment of Antonie (as being not yet ready to put his fortune to her tryall) throwes her selfe, great with childe, and as big with sorrow, into the trauell of a most laboursome reconciliation: taking her iourney from the farthest part of Greece, to finde Octauius, with whom her care and teares were so good agents, that they effected their Commission beyond all expectation: and for that time quite disarmed their wrath, which yet long could not hold so. For Antonius falling into the relapse of his former disease, watching his opportunity, got ouer againe into Ægypt, where he so forgot himselfe, that hee quite put off his owne nature, and wholly became a prey to his pleasures, as if he had wound himselfe out of the respect of Countrey, bloud and alliance; which gaue to Octauia the cause of much affliction, and to mee, the Argument of this Letter. 1 To thee (yet deere) though most disloyall Lord, Whom impious loue keeps in a barbarous land, Thy wronged wife Octauia sendeth word Of th'vnkind wounds receiued by thy hand: Great Antony, O let thine eyes afford But to permit thy heart to vnderstand The hurt thou dost, and doe but reade her teares, That still is thine though thou wilt not be hers. 2 Although perhaps, these my complaints may come Whilst thou in th'armes of that incestuous Queene, The staine of Ægypt, and the shame of Rome Shalt dallying sit, and blush to haue them seene: Whilst proud disdainfull she, gessing from whome The message came, and what the cause hath beene, Will scorning say, Faith this comes from your Deere, Now Sir you must be shent for staying heere. 3 From her indeede it comes, delitious Dame, (Thou royall Concubine and Queene of lust) Whose armes yet pure, whose breasts are voyde of blame, And whose most lawfull flame proues thine vniust: Tis she that sends the message of thy shame, And his vntruth that hath betraid her trust: Pardon, deare Lord, from her these sorrowes are, Whose bed brings neither infamie nor warre. 4 And therefore heare her words, that too too much Hath heard the wrongs committed by thy shame, Although at first my trust in thee was such, As it held out against the strongest fame: My heart would neuer let in once a touch Of least beleefe, till all confirm'd the same: That I was almost last that would belieue, Because I knew me first that most must grieue. 5 How oft haue poore abused I tooke part With Falshood, onely for to make thee true? How oft haue I argued against my heart, Not suffering it to know that which it knew? And for I would not haue thee what thou art, I made my selfe, vnto my selfe vntrue: So much my loue labour'd against my sinne, To shut out feare which yet kept feare within. 6 For I could neuer thinke th'aspiring mind Of worthy and victorious Anthonie, Could be by such a Syren so declind, As to be traind a prey to Luxury: I could not thinke my Lord would be s'vnkind, As to despise his Children, Rome and me: But O how soone are they deceiu'd that trust, And more their shame that will be so vniust. 7 But now that certaine fame hath open laid Thy new relapse, and strange reuolt from me, Truth hath quite beaten all my hopes away, And made the passage of my sorrowes free; For now poore heart, there's nothing in the way Remaines to stand betwixt Despaire and thee: All is throwne downe, there comes no succours new, It is most true, my Lord is most vntrue. 8 And now I may with shame inough pull in The colours I aduanced in his grace, For that subduing powre, that him did win, Hath lost me too, the honour of my face: Yet why should I, bearing no part of sinne, Beare such a mighty part of his disgrace? Yes, though it be not mine, it is of mine: And his renowne being clips'd, mine cannot shine. 9 Which makes me, as I doe, hide from the eye Of the misiudging vulgar that will deeme, That sure there was in me some reason why Which made thee thus, my bed to disesteeme: So that alas, poore vndeseruing I, A cause of thy vncleane deserts shall seeme, Though lust takes neuer ioy in what is due, But still leaues knowne delights to seeke out new. 10 And yet my brother Cæsar laboured, To haue me leaue thy house, and liue more free: But God forbid Octauia should be led, To leaue to liue in thine, though left by thee. The pledges here of thy forsaken bed, Are still the obiects that remember me What Antony was once, although false now, And is my Lord, though he neglect his vow. 11 These walles that here doe keepe me out of sight, Shall keepe me all vnspotted vnto thee, And testifie that I will doe thee right; Ile neuer staine thy house, though thou shame me: The now sad Chamber of my once delight, Shall be the Temple of my pietie, Sacred vnto the faith I reuerence, Where I will pay my teares for thy offence. 12 Although my youth, thy absence, and this wrong Might draw my bloud to forfeit vnto shame; Nor neede I frustrate my delights so long, That haue such meanes to carry so the same, Since that the face of greatnesse is so strong, As it dissolues suspect, and beares out blame; Hauing all secret helpes that long thereto, That seldome wants there aught, but will to do. 13 Which yet to doe, ere lust this heart shall frame, Earth swallow me aliue, Hell rap me hence: Shall I, because dispis'd, contemne my shame, And adde disgrace to others impudence? What can my powre, but giue more powre to fame? Greatnesse must make it great incontinence: Chambers are false, the bed and all will tell, No doore keepes in their shame that doe not well. 14 Hath greatnesse aught peculiar else alone, But to stand faire and bright aboue the base? What doth diuide the Cottage from the Throne, If vice shall lay both leuell with disgrace? For if vncleannesse make them but all one, What priuiledge hath Honour by his place? What though our sinnes goe braue and better clad They are as those in ragges, as base, as bad. 15 I know not how, but wrongfully I know Hath vndiscerning custome plac'd our kind Vnder desert, and set vs farre below The reputation to our sexe assign'd: Charging our wrong reputed weaknesse, how We are vnconstant, fickle, false, vnkinde: And though our life with thousand proofes shewes no, Yet since strength saies it, weakenesse must be so. 16 Vnequall partage to b'allow'd no share Of power to doe of lifes best benefit: But stand, as if we interdicted were Of vertue, action, liberty and might: Must you haue all, and not vouchsafe to spare Our weaknesse any int'rest of delight? Is there no portion left for vs at all, But sufferance, sorrow, ignorance and thrall? 17 Thrice happy you, in whom it is no fault, To know, to speake, to doe, and to be wise: Whose words haue credit, and whose deedes, though naught, Must yet be made to seeme farre otherwise: You can be onely heard, whilst we are taught To hold our peace, and not to exercise The powers of our best parts, because your parts Haue with our freedome robb'd vs of our harts. 18 We, in this prison of our selues confin'd, Must here shut vp with our owne passions liue, Turn'd in vpon vs, and denied to find The vent of outward meanes that might relieue: That they alone must take vp all our mind, And no room left vs, but to thinke and grieue: Yet oft our narrowed thoughts looke more direct Then your loose wisdomes born with wild neglect. 19 For, should we to (as God forbid we should) Carry no better hand on our desires Then your strength doth, what int'rest could Our wronged patience pay you for your hires? What mixture of strange generations would Succeede the fortunes of vncertaine Sires? What foule confusion in your bloud and race To your immortall shame and our disgrace? 20 What? are there barres for vs, no bounds for you? Must Leuitie stand sure, though Firmenesse fall? And are you priuiledg'd to be vntrue, And we no grant to be dispens'd withall? Must we inuiolable keepe your due, Both to your loue, and to your falshood thrall? Whilst you haue stretch't your lust vpon your will, As if your strength were licenc'd to doe ill. 21 O if you be more strong, then be more iust, Cleere this suspition, make not the world to doubt, Whether in strong or weake be better trust, If frailty or else valour be more stout: And if we haue shut in our hearts from lust, Let not your bad example let them out, Thinke that there is like feeling in our bloud: If you will haue vs good, be you then good. 22 Is it, that loue doth take no true delight In what it hath, but still in what it would, Which drawes you on to doe vs this vnright, Whilst feare in vs, of loosing what we hold, Keepes vs in still to you, that set vs light, So that, what you vnties, doth vs infolde? Then Loue, tis thou that dost confound vs so, To make our truth the occasion of our wo. 23 Distressed woman kind, that either must For louing loose your loues, or get neglect: Whilst wantons are more car'd for then the iust, And falshood cherisht, Faith without respect: Better she fares in whom is lesse trust, And more is lou'd that is in more suspect. Which (pardon me) shewes no great strength of mind To be most theirs, that vse you most vnkind 24 Yet well it fits, for that sinne euer must Be tortur'd with the racke of his owne frame; For he that holdes no faith, shall find no trust, But sowing wrong, is sure to reape the same: How can he looke to haue his measure iust, That fils deceit, and reckons not of shame, And being not pleas'd with what he hath in lot, Shall euer pine for that which he hath not? 25 Yet if thou couldst not loue, thou mightst haue sem'd Though to haue seem'd, had likewise beene vniust: Yet so much are leane shewes of vs esteem'd, That oft they feede, though not suffice our trust: Because our nature grieueth to be deem'd To be so wrong'd, although we be, and must, And it's some ease yet to be kindly vs'd In outward shew, though secretly abus'd. 26 But woe to her that both in shew despis'd And in effect disgrac'd, and left forlorne, For whom no comforts are to be deuis'd, Nor no new hopes can euermore be borne: O Antony, could it not haue suffiz'd That I was thine, but must be made her scorne That enuies all her bloud, and doth deuide Thee from thy selfe, onely to serue her pride? 27 What fault haue I committed that should make So great dislike of me and of my loue? Or doth thy fault but an occasion take For to dislike what most doth it reproue? Because the conscience gladly would mistake Her owne misdeeds which she would faine remoue; And they that are vnwilling to amend, Will take offence, because they will offend. 28 Or hauing runne beyond all pardon quite, They flie and ioyne with sinne as wholly his, Making it now their side, their part, their right, And to turne backe, would shew t'haue done amisse: For now they thinke, not to be opposite To what obraides their fault, were wickednesse: So much doth folly thrust them into blame, That euen to leaue off shame, they count it shame. 29 Which doe not thou, deere Lord, for I doe not Pursue thy fault, but sue for thy returne Backe to thy selfe, whom thou hast both forgot With me, poore me, that doth not spight, but mourne: And if thou couldst as well amend thy blot As I forgiue, these plaints had beene forborne: And thou shouldst be the same vnto my hart Which once thou were, not that which now thou art. 30 Though deepe doth sit the hard recouering smart Of that last wound (which God grant be the last) And more doth touch that tender feeling part Of my sad soule, then all th'vnkindnesse past: And Antony, I appeale to thine owne hart, (If th'heart which once was thine thou yet still hast) To iudge if euer woman that did liue Had iuster cause, then wretched I, to grieue. 31 For comming vnto Athens, as I did, Weary and weake with toyle, and all distrest, After I had with sorrow compassed A hard consent, to grant me that request: And how my trauell was considered, And all my care and cost, thy selfe knowes best: That wouldst not moue one foote from lust for me, That had left all was deere to come to thee. 32 For first what great adoe had I to win M'offended brother Cæsars backward will? And praid, and wept, and cride to stay the sinne Of ciuill rancor rising twixt you still: For in what case shall wretched I be in, Set twixt both, to share with both your ill? My bloud said I with either of you goes, Who euer win, I shall be sure to lose. 33 For what shame should such mighty persons get, For two weake womens cause to disagree? Nay, what shall I that shall be deem'd to set Th'inkindled fire, seeming inflam'd for me? O if I be the motiue of this heate, Let these vnguilty hands the quenchers be, And let me trudge to mediate an accord, The agent twixt my brother and my Lord. 34 With prayers, vowes and teares, with vrging hard I wrung from him a slender grant at last, And with the rich prouisions I prepar'd For thy (intended Parthian warre) made haste, Weighing not how my poore weake body far'd, But all the tedious difficulties past: And came to Athens; whence I Niger sent, To shew thee of my comming and intent. 35 Whereof, when he had made relation, I was commanded to approach no neare; Then sent I backe, to know what should be done With th'horse, and men, and money I had there: Whereat perhaps when some remorse begun To touch thy soule, to thinke yet what we were, Th'inchantresse strait stept twixt thy heart and thee, And intercepts all thoughts that came of mee. 36 She armes her teares, the ingins of deceit And all her batterie, to oppose my loue, And bring thy comming grace to a retreit, The powre of all her subtilty to proue: Now pale and faint she languishes, and strait Seemes in a sound, vnable more to moue: Whilst her instructed fellowes ply thine eares With forged passions, mixt with fained teares. 37 Hard-hearted Lord, say they, how canst thou see This mighty Queene, a creature so diuine Lie thus distrest, and languishing for thee, And onely wretched, but for being thine? Whilst base Octauia must intitled be Thy wife, and she esteem'd thy Concubine: Aduance thy heart, raise it vnto his right, And let a Scepter baser passions quit. 38 Thus they assaile thy natures weakest side, And worke vpon th'aduantage of thy minde, Knowing where iudgement stood least fortified, And how t'incounter folly in her kinde: But yet the while, O what dost thou abide, Who in thy selfe such wrastling thoughts dost finde? In what confused case is thy soule in, Rackt betwixt pitty, sorrow, shame and sin? 39 I cannot tell, but sure I dare beleeue My trauels needs must some compassion moue: For no such locke to bloud could Nature giue To shut out Pitty, though it shut out Loue: Conscience must leaue a little way to grieue To let in horror comming to reproue The guilt of thine offence that caus'd the same, For deepest wounds the hand of our owne shame. 40 Neuer haue vniust pleasures beene compleete, In ioyes intire, but still feare kept the dore, And held backe something from that full of sweete, To intersowre vnsure delights the more: For neuer did all circumstances meete With those desires which were conceiu'd before: Some thing must still be left to checke our sinne, And giue a touch of what should not haue bin. 41 Wretched Mankinde, wherfore hath nature made The lawfull vndelightfull, th'vniust shame? As if our pleasure onely were forbade, But to giue fire to lust, t'adde greater flame; Or else, but as ordained more to lade Our heart with passions to confound the same; Which though it be, yet adde not worse to ill, Do, as the best men do, bound thine owne will. 42 Redeeme thy selfe, and now at length make peace With thy diuided heart opprest with toile: Breake vp this warre, this brest-dissention cease, Thy passions to thy passions reconcile: I do not onely seeke my good t'increase, But thine owne ease, and liberty: the while Thee in the circuit of thy selfe confine, And be thine owne, and then thou wilt be mine. 43 I know my pittied loue, doth aggrauate Enuy and Wrath for these wrongs offered: And that my suffrings adde with my estate, Coales in thy bosome, hatred on thy head: Yet is not that, my fault, but, my hard fate, Who rather wish to haue beene vnpitied Of all but thee, then that my loue should be Hurtfull to him that is so deere to me. 44 Cannot the busie world let me alone, To beare alone the burthen of my griefe, But they must intermeddle with my mone, And seeke t'offend me with vnsought reliefe? Whilst my afflictions labour to moue none But onely thee, must Pitty play the thiefe, To steale so many hearts to hurt my hart, And moue a part against my deerest part? 45 Yet all this shall not preiudice my Lord, If yet he will but make returne at last; His sight shall raze out of the sad record Of my inrowled griefe all that is past: And I will not so much as once afford Place for a thought to thinke I was disgrac'd: And pitty shall bring backe againe with me Th'offended harts that haue forsaken thee. 46 And therefore come deere Lord, lest longer stay Do arme against thee all the powres of spight, And thou be made at last the wofull pray Of full inkindled wrath, and ruin'd quite: But what presaging thought of bloud doth stay My trembling hand, and doth my soule affright? What horror do I see, prepar'd t'attend Th'euent of this? what end vnlesse thou end? 47 With what strange formes and shadowes ominous Did my last sleepe, my grieu'd soule intertaine? I dreamt, yee O dreames are but friuolous, And yet Ile tell it, and God grant it vaine. A sea horse.Me thought a mighty Hippopotamus From Nilus floating, thrusts into the maine, Vpon whose backe, a wanton Mermaide sate, As if she rul'd his course, and steer'd his fate. 48 With whom t'incounter, forth another makes, Alike in kind, of strength and powre as good: At whose ingrappling, Neptunes mantle takes A purple colour, dyde with streames of bloud; Whereat this looker on amaz'd, forsakes Her Champion there, who yet the better stood: But se'ing her gone, strait after her he hies, As if his heart and strength lay in her eyes. 49 On followes Wrath vpon Disgrace and Feare, Whereof th'euent forsooke me with the night But my wak'd cares, gaue me: these shadowes were Drawne but from darkenesse to instruct the light. These secret figures, natures message beare Of comming woes, were they desciphered right; But if as cloudes of sleepe thou shalt them take, Yet credite Wrath and Spight that are awake. 50 Preuent, great spirit, the tempests that begin, If Lust and thy Ambition haue left way But to looke out, and haue not shut all in, To stop thy iudgement from a true suruay Of thy estate, and let my hart within Consider in what danger thou dost lay Thy life and mine, to leaue the good thou hast, To follow hopes with shadowes ouercast. 51 Come, come away from wrong, from craft, from toile, Possesse thine owne with right, with trueth, with peace: Breake from these snares, thy iudgment vnbeguile, Free thine owne torment, and my griefe release. But whither am I carried all this while Beyond my scope, and know not when to cease? Words still with my increasing sorrowes grow: I know t'haue said too much, but not enow. Wherefore no more, but onely I commend To thee the hart that's thine, and so I end. Finis. V. A PANEGYRIKE CONGRATVLATORIE TO THE KING (JAMES I.). 1603. A PANEGYRIKE CONGRATVLATORIE to the Kings most excellent Maiestie. 1 Loe here the glory of a greater day Then England euer heretofore could see In all her daies! When she did most display The ensignes of her pow'r, or whenas she Did spread her selfe the most, and most did sway Her state abroade, yet could she neuer be Thus blest at home, nor euer come to grow To be intire in her full Orbe till now. 2 And now she is, and now in peace therefore Shake hands with Vnion, O thou mighty State, Now thou art all Great-Britaine and no more, No Scot, no English now, nor no debate; No borders but the Ocean and the shore: No wall of Adrian serues to separate Our mutuall loue, nor our obedience, Being Subiects all to one imperiall Prince. 3 What heretofore could neuer yet be wrought By all the swords of pow'r, by bloud, by fire, By ruine and distruction; here is brought To passe with peace, with loue, with ioy, desire: Our former blessed vnion hath begot A greater vnion that is more intire, And makes vs more our selues, sets vs at one With Nature that ordain'd vs to be one. 4 Glory of men, this hast thou brought to vs, And yet hast brought vs more then this by farre; Religion comes with thee, peace, righteousnesse, Iudgement and iustice, which more glorious are Then all thy Kingdomes; and art more by this Then Lord and Sou'raigne, more then Emperor Ouer the hearts of men that let thee in To more then all the pow'rs on earth can win. 5 God makes thee King of our estates, but we Doe make thee King of our affection, King of our loue: a passion borne more free, And most vnsubiect to dominion: And know, that England which in that degree Can loue with such a true deuotion, Those that are lesse then Kings; to thee must bring More loue, who art so much more then a King. 6 And King of this great Nation, populous, Stout, valiant, pow'rfull both by Sea and Land, Attemptiue, able, worthy, generous, Which ioyfully embraces thy command; A people tractable, obsequious, Apt to be fashion'd by thy glorious hand To any forme of honor, t'any way Of high attempts, thy vertues shall assay. 7 A people so inur'd to peace, so wrought To a successiue course of quietnesse, As th'haue forgot (and O, b'it still forgot) The nature of their ancient stubbornnesse: Time altred hath the forme, the meanes, and brought The State to that proportion'd euennesse, As 'tis not like againe 'twill euer come (Being vs'd abroad) to draw the sword at home. 8 This people, this great State, these hearts adore Thy Scepter now, and now turne all to thee, Touch't with as pow'rfull zeale, and if not more, (And yet O more, how could there euer be Then vnto her, whom yet we doe deplore Amidst our ioy!) And giue vs leaue if we Reioyce and mourne, that cannot without wrong So soone forget her we enioy'd so long. 9 Which likewise makes for thee, that yet we holde True after death, and bring not this respect To a new Prince for hating of the olde; Or from desire of change, or from neglect; Whereby, O mighty Soueraigne, thou art tolde What thou and thine are likely to expect From such a faith, that doth not haste to runne Before their time to an arising Sunne. 10 And let my humble Muse, whom she did grace, Beg this one grace for her that now lies dead, That no vile tongue may spot her with disgrace, Nor that her fame become disfigured: O let her rest in peace, that rul'd in peace; Let not her honour be disquieted Now after death: but let the Graue inclose All but her good, and that it cannot close. 11 It addes much to thy glory and our grace, That this continued current of our loue Runnes thus to thee, all with so swift a pace; And that from peace to peace we doe remoue Not as in motion put from out our place, But in one course, and doe not seeme to moue, But in more ioy then euer heretofore; And well we may, since thou wilt make vs more. 12 Our loue we see concurres with Gods great loue, Who onely made thy way, thy passage plaine, Leuell'd the world for thee, did all remoue, That might the shew but of a let retaine: Vnbarr'd the North, humbled the South, did moue The hearts of all the right to entertaine; Held other states embroil'd, whose enuie might Haue fostred factions to impugne thy right: 13 And all for thee, that we the more might praise The glory of his powre, and reuerence thine, Whom he hath rais'd to glorifie our dayes, And make this Empire of the North to shine Against all th'impious workings, all th'assayes Of vile disnatur'd Vipers, whose designe Was to embroile the State, t'obscure the light, And that cleere brightnesse of thy sacred right. 14 To whose reproch, since th'issue and successe Doth a sufficient marke of shame returne, Let no Pen else blazon their ouglinesse; Be it enough, that God and men doe scorne Their proiects, censures, vaine pretendences: Let not our children, that are yet vnborne, Find there were any offred to contest, Or make a doubt to haue our Kingdome blest. 15 Burie that question in th'eternall graue Of darknesse, neuer to be seene againe: Suffice we haue thee whom we ought to haue, And t'whom all good men knew did appertaine Th'inheritance thy sacred birth-right gaue, That needed n'other suffrages t'ordaine What onely was thy due, nor no decree To be made know'n, since none was known but thee. 16 Witnesse the ioy, the vniuersall cheere, The speede, the ease, the will, the forwardnesse Of all this great and spacious State, how deere It held thy title and thy worthinesse: Haste could not post so speedy any where, But Fame seem'd there before in readinesse, To tell our hopes, and to proclaime thy name; O greater then our hopes, more then thy fame! 17 What a returne of comfort dost thou bring Now at this fresh returning of our bloud, Thus meeting with the opening of the Spring, To make our spirits likewise to imbud! What a new season of incouraging Biginnes t'inlength the dayes dispos'd to good! What apprehension of recouerie Of greater strength, of more abilitie! 18 The pulse of England neuer more did beat So strong as now: nor euer were our harts Let out to hopes so spacious and so great As now they are: nor euer in all parts Did we thus feele so comfortable heat, As now the glory of thy worth imparts: The whole complection of the Common-wealth, So weake before, hop'd neuer for more health. 19 Could'st thou but see from Douer to the Mount, From Totnes, to the Orcades, what ioy, What cheere, what triumphs, and what deere account Is held of thy renowne this blessed day: A day which we and ours must euer count Our solemne festiuall, as well we may. And though men thus court Kings still which are new, Yet doe they more, where they find more is due. 20 They feare the humours of a future Prince, Who either lost a good or felt a bad, But thou hast cheer'd vs of this feare long since, We know thee more, then by report we had: We haue an euerlasting euidence Vnder thy hand, that now we need not dread Thou wilt be otherwise in thy designes Then there thou art in those iudiciall lines. 21 It is the greatest glory vpon earth To be a King, but yet much more to giue The institution with the happy birth Vnto a King, and teach him how to liue: VVe haue, by thee, far more then thine owne worth, That doth encourage, strengthen and relieue Our hopes in the succession of thy blood, That like to thee, they likewise will be good. 22 VVe haue an earnest, that doth euen tie Thy Scepter to thy word, and binds thy Crowne (That els no band can binde) to ratifie VVhat thy religious hand hath there set downe, VVherein thy all commanding Soueraigntie Stands subiect to thy Pen and thy renowne; There we behold thee King of thine owne hart, And see what we must be, and what thou art. 23 There great Exemplare, Prototipe, of Kings, VVe finde the good shall dwell within thy Court; Plaine zeale and truth, free from base flatterings, Shall there be entertain'd, and haue resort; Honest discretion, that no cunning brings, But counsels that lie right, and that import, Is there receiu'd, with those whose care attends Thee and the State more then their priuate ends. 24 There grace and fauour shall not be dispos'd, But by proportion, euen and vpright; There are no mightie Mountaines interpos'd Betweene thy beames and vs, t'imbarre thy light; There Maiesty liues not as if inclos'd Or made a prey t'a priuate benefit: The hand of Pow'r deales there her owne reward, And thereby reapes the whole of mens regard. 25 There is no way to get vp to respect, But onely by the way of worthinesse; All passages that may seeme indirect Are stopt vp now, and there is no accesse By grosse corruption, bribes cannot effect For th'vndeseruing any offices; Th'ascent is cleane, and he that doth ascend Must haue his meanes as cleane as is his end. 26 The deeds of worth and laudable desarts Shall not now passe thorow the straight report Of an imbasing tongue, that but imparts What with his ends and humours shall comport: The Prince himselfe now heares, sees, knowes what parts Honor and Vertue acts, and in what sort: And thereto giues his grace accordingly, And cheeres vp other to the like thereby. 27 Nor shall we now haue vse of flatterie, For he knowes falshood farre more subtill is Then truth, basenesse then libertie, Feare then loue, t'inuent these flourishes: And Adulation now is spent so nie As that it hath no colours to expresse That which it would, that now we must be faine T'vnlearne that Arte, and labour to be plaine. 28 For where there is no eare to be abus'd None will be found that dare t'informe a wrong: The insolent deprauer stands confus'd: The impious Atheist seemes to want a tongue, Transform'd into the fashion that is vs'd. All striue t'appeare like those they liue among, And all will seeme compos'd by that same square By which they see the best and greatest are. 29 Such pow'r hath thy example and respect, As that without a sword, without debate, Without a noise (or feeling in effect) Thou wilt dispose, change, forme, accommodate Thy Kingdome, people, rule, and all effect Without the least conuulsion of the State; That this great passage and mutation will Not seeme a change, but onely of our ill. 30 We shall continue and remaine all one, In Law, in Iustice, and in Magistrate; Thou wilt not alter the foundation Thy Ancestors haue laid of this Estate, Nor grieue thy Land with innouation, Nor take from vs more then thou wilt collate; Knowing that course is best to be obseru'd, Whereby a State hath longest beene preseru'd. 31 A King of England now most graciouslie, Remits the iniuries that haue beene done T'a King of Scots, and makes his clemencie To checke them more then his correction; Th'annointed bloud that stain'd most shamefully This ill seduced State, he lookes thereon With th'eye of griefe, not wrath, t'auenge the same, Since th'Authors are extinct that caus'd that shame. 32 Thus mightie riuers quietly doe glide, And doe not by their rage their powers professe, But by their mightie workings, when in pride Small Torrents roare more lowd, and worke much lesse: Peace, greatnesse best becomes: calme power doth guide With a farre more imperious statelinesse, Then all the swords of violence can doe, And easier gaines those ends she tends vnto. 33 Then England, thou hast reason thus to cheare, Reason to ioy and triumph in this wise, When thou shalt gaine so much, and haue no feare To lose ought els but thy deformities; When thus thou shalt haue health and be set cleare From all thy great infectious maladies, By such a hand that best knowes how to cure, And where most lie those griefes thou dost endure. 34 When thou shalt see there is another grace Then to be rich; another dignitie Nam vbi cupido diuitiarum inuasit, neque disciplina, neque artes bonœ neque ingenium vllum satis pollet.Then money; other meanes for place Then gold; wealth shall not now make honestie; When thou shalt see the estimation base Of that which most afflicts our miserie: Without the which, else could'st thou neuer see Our wayes laid right, nor men themselues to bee. 35 By which improuement we shall gaine much more Then by Peru, or all discoueries: For this way to imbase, is to instore The treasure of the Land, and make it rise. This is the onely key t'vnlocke the dore, To let out plenty, that it may suffice: For more then all this Ile, for more increase Of subiects then by thee, there can increase. 36 This shall make roome and place enough for all, Which otherwise would not suffice a few, And by proportion Geometricall Shall so dispose to all what shall be due, As that without corruption, wrangling, brawle, Intrusion, wresting, and by meanes vndue, Desert shall haue her charge, and but one charge, As hauing but one body to discharge. 37 Whereby the all in-cheering Maiestie Shall come to shine at full in all her parts, And spread her beames of comfort equally, As being all alike to like desarts: For thus to checke, imbase and vilifie Th'esteeme of wealth, will fashion so our hearts To worthy ends, as that we shall by much More labour to be good then to be rich. 38 This will make peace with Law, restore the Bar, T'her ancient silence, where contention now Makes so confus'd a noise; this will debar The fostring of debate, and ouerthrow That ougly Monster, that foule rauener, Extortion, which so hideously did grow, By making prey vpon our misery, And wasting it againe as wickedly. 39 The strange examples of impou'rishments, Of sacriledge, exaction and of waste, Shall not be made, nor held as presidents For times to come, but end with th'ages past: Whenas the State shall yeeld more suppliments (Being well imploy'd) then Kings can well exhaust; This golden Meadow lying ready still Then to be mow'd, when their occasions will. 40 Fauour, like pitie, in the hearts of men Haue the first touches euer violent: But soone againe it comes to languish, when The motiue of that humour shall be spent: But being still fed with that which first hath been The cause thereof, it holdes still permanent, And is kept in by course, by forme, by kinde, And time begets more ties that still more binde. 41 The broken frame of this disioynted State, Being by the blisse of thy great Grandfather Henry the seuenth, restor'd to an estate More sound then euer, and more stedfaster, Owes all it hath to him, and in that rate Stands bond to thee that art his successer: For without him it had not beene begunne, And without thee we had beene now vndone. 42 He, of a priuate man, became a King, Hauing indur'd the weight of tyrannie, Mourn'd with the world, complain'd, and knew the thing That good men wish for in their miserie Vnder ill Kings, saw what it was to bring Order and forme to the recouerie Of an vnruly State; conceiu'd what cure Would kill the cause of this distemp'rature. 43 Thou, borne a King, hast in thy State endur'd The sowre affronts of priuate discontent With subiects broiles; and euer beene enur'd To this great mysterie of gouernment: Whereby thy Princely wisdome hath allur'd A State to peace, left to thee turbulent, And brought vs an addition to the frame Of this great worke, squar'd fitly to the same. 44 And both you (by the all-working Prouidence, That fashions out of dangers, toyles, debates, Those whom it hath ordained to commence The first, and great establishments of States) Came when your aide, your powers experience (Which out of iudgement best accommodates These ioynts of rule) was more then most desir'd, And when the times of neede the most requir'd. 45 And as he laid the modell of this frame, By which was built so strong a worke of State, As all the powers of changes in the same, All that excesse of a disordinate And lustfull Prince, nor all that after came, Nor child, nor stranger, nor yet womens fate, Could once disioynt the couplements, whereby It held together in iust Symetry. 46 So thou likewise art come as fore-ordaind, To reinforce the same more really, Which oftentimes hath but beene entertain'd By the onely stile and name of Maiesty; And by no other counsells oft attain'd Those ends of her inioy'd tranquility, Then by this forme, and by the incumbrances Of neighbour States that gaue it a successe. 47 That hadst thou had no title (as thou hast The onely right, and none hath els a right) We yet must now haue bin inforc'd t'haue cast Our selues into thy armes, to set all right, And to auert confusion, bloudshed, waste, That otherwise vpon vs needes must light: None but a King, and no King els beside Could now haue sau'd this State from being destroid'. 48 Thus hath the hundred yeeres brought backe againe The sacred bloud lent to adorne the North, And here return'd it with a greater gaine, And greater glory then we sent it forth. Thus doth th'all-working Prouidence retaine, And keepe for great effects the seede of worth, And so doth point the stops of time thereby, In periods of vncertaine certainty. 49 Margaret of Richmond (glorious Grandmother Vnto that other precious Margaret, From whence th'Almighty worker did transfer This branch of peace, as from a roote well set) Thou Mother, Author, Plotter, Counseller Of vnion, that didst both conceiue, beget And bring forth happinesse to this great State, To make it thus intirely fortunate. 50 O couldst thou now but view this faire successe, This great effect of thy religious worke, And see therein how God hath pleas'd to blesse Thy charitable counsels and to worke Still greater good out of the blessednesse Of this conioyned Lancaster and Yorke: Which all conioyn'd within, and those shut out Whom nature and their birth had set without. 51 How much hast thou bound all posterities In this great worke to reuerence thy name! And with thee, that religious, faithfull, wise And learned Mourton, who contriu'd the same, And first aduis'd, and did so well aduise As that the good successe that thereof came Shew'd well, that holy hands, cleane thoughts, cleere harts Are onely fit to act such glorious parts. 52 But Muse, these deare remembrances must be In their conuenient places registred, When thou shalt bring sterne discord to agree, And bloudy warre into a quiet bed: Which worke must now be finished by thee, That long hath laine vndone, as destined Vnto the glory of these dayes: for which Thy vowes and Verse haue laboured so much. 53 Thou euer hast opposed all thy might Against contention, furie, pride and wrong, Perswading still to hold the course of right; And peace hath beene the burden of thy song: And now thy selfe shalt haue the benefit Of quietnesse, which thou hast wanted long; And now shalt haue calme peace, and vnion With thine owne warres, and now thou must go on. 54 Onely the ioy of this so deare a thing Made me looke backe vnto the cause, whence came This so great good, this blessing of a King, When our estate so much requir'd the same: When we had need of pow'r for the well ordering Of our affaires, need of a spirit to frame The world to good, to grace and worthinesse, Out of this humour of luxuriousnesse. 55 And brings vs backe vnto our selues againe, Vnto our ancient natiue modestie; From out these forren sinnes we entertaine, These lothesome surfets, ougly gluttonie; From this vnmanly and this idle vaine Of wanton and superfluous brauery: The wracke of Gentry, spoyle of Noblenesse; And square vs by thy temp'rate sobernesse. 56 When Abstinence is fashion'd by the Time, It is no rare thing to be abstinent, But then it is, when th'age full fraught with crime Lies prostrate vnto all misgouernment. And who is not licencious in the prime And heate of youth, nor then incontinent When out of might he may, he neuer will; No power can tempt him to that taste of ill. 57 Then what are we t'expect from such a hand That doth this sterne of faire example guide? Who will not now shame to haue no command Ouer his lusts? Who would be seene t'abide Vnfaithfull to his vowes, to infringe the band Of a most sacred knot which God hath tide? Who would now seeme to be dishonoured With th'vncleane touch of an vnlawfull bed? 58 What a great checke will this chaste Court be now To wanton Court debausht with luxury; Where we no other Mistresses shall know But her to whom we owe our loyalty? Chaste Mother of our Princes, whence do grow Those righteous issues, which shall glorifie And comfort many Nations with their worth, To her perpetuall grace that brought them forth. 59 We shall not feare to haue our wiues distain'd, Nor yet our daughters violated here By an imperiall lust, that being vnrain'd, Will hardly be resisted any where. He will not be betrai'd with ease, nor train'd With idle rest, in soft delights to weare His time of life: but knowes whereto he tends, How worthy minds are made for worthy ends. 60 And that this mighty worke of vnion now Begun with glory, must with grace run on, And be so clos'd, as all the ioynts may grow Together firme in due proportion: A worke of power and Iudgement, that must show All parts of wisedome and discretion That man can shew, that no cloud may impaire This day of hope, whose morning shewes so faire. 61 He hath a mighty burden to sustaine, Whose fortune doth succeed a gracious Prince, Or where mens expectations entertaine Hopes of more good, and more beneficence: But yet he vndergoes a greater paine, A more laborious worke, who must commence The great foundation of a gouernment, And lay the frame of Order and Content. 62 Especially where mens desires do runne A greedy course of eminency, gaine, And priuate hopes, weighing not what is done For the Republicke, so themselues may gaine Their ends, and where few care who be vndone, So they be made, whil'st all do entertaine The present motions that this passage brings With th'infancy of change, vnder new kings. 63 So that the weight of all seemes to relie Wholly vpon thine owne discretion; Thy iudgement now must only rectifie This frame of pow'r thy glory stands vpon From thee must come; that thy posterity May ioy this peace, and hold this vnion: For whil'st all worke for their owne benefit, Thy only worke must keepe vs all vpright. 64 For, did not now thy full maturity Of yeeres and wisdome, that discerne what showes, What arte and colours may deceiue the eye, Secure our trust that that cleere iudgement knowes Vpon what grounds depend thy Maiesty, And whence the glory of thy greatnesse growes; We might distrust lest that a side might part Thee from thy selfe, and so surprize thy heart. 65 Since th'art but one, and that against thy brest Are laid all th'ingins both of skill and wit, And all th'assaults of cunning are addrest With stratagems of Art to enter it, To make a prey of grace, and to inuest Their pow'rs within thy loue, that they might sit And stir that way which their affection tends, Respecting but themselues and their owne ends. 66 And see'ng how difficult a thing it is To rule, and what strength is requir'd to stand Against all th'interplac'd respondences Of combinations, set to keepe the hand And eye of power from out the Prouinces That Auarice may draw to her command; Which, to keepe hers, she others vowes to spare, That they againe to her might vse like care. 67 But God, that rais'd thee vp to act this part, Hath giuen thee all those powers of worthines, Fit for so great a worke, and fram'd thy heart Discernable of all apparences; Taught thee to know the world, and this great Art Of ord'ring man, Knowledge of Knowledges; That from thee men might reckon how this State Became restor'd, and was made fortunate. 68 That thou the first, with vs, in name, might'st be The first in course, to fashion vs a new, VVherein the times hath offred that to thee, VVhich seldome t'other Princes could accrue: Thou hast th'aduantage only to be free T'imploy thy fauours where they shall be due, And to dispose thy grace in generall, And like to Ioue, to be alike to all. 69 Thy fortune hath indebted thee to none, But t'all thy people vniuersally, And not to them, but for their loue alone, Which they account is placed worthily: Nor wilt thou now frustrate their hopes, wheron They rest, nor they faile in their loyalty; Since no Prince comes deceiued in his trust, But he that first deceiues, and proues vniust. 70 Then since we are in this so faire a way Of Restauration, Greatnesse and Command, Cursed be he that causes the least stay In this faire worke, or interrupts thy hand; And cursed he that offers to betray Thy graces or thy goodnesse to withstand; Let him be held abhorr'd, and all his race Inherit but the portion of disgrace. 71 And he that shall by wicked Offices Be th'author of the least disturbancy, Or seeke t'auert thy godly purposes, Be euer held the scorne of infamy: And let men but consider their successe Who Princes loues abus'd presumptuously: They shall perceiue their ends do still relate, That sure God loues them not whom men do hate. 72 And it is iust, that they who make a prey Of Princes fauours, in the end againe Be made a prey to Princes, and repay The spoiles of misery with greater gaine; Whose sacrifices euer do allay The wrath of men, conceiu'd in their disdaine: For that their hatred prosecuteth still, More than ill Princes, those that make them ill. 73 But both thy iudgement and estate doth free Thee from these powers of feare and flattery The conquerours of Kings, by whom we see Are wrought the acts of all impiety: Thou art so set, as th'hast no cause to be Iealous, or dreadfull of disloyalty; The pedestall whereon thy greatnesse stands, Is built of all our hearts, and all our hands. VI. A Fvnerall Poeme Vpon the Death of the late noble Earle of Deuonshire. 1606. A FVNERALL Poeme. Vpon the Death of the late noble Earle of Deuonshire. Now that the hand of death hath layd thee there, Where neither greatnesse, pompe, nor grace, we see, Nor any differences of earth; and where No vaile is drawne betwixt thy selfe and thee: Now Deuonshire that thou art but a name, And all the rest of thee besides is gone, When men conceiue thee not, but by the fame Of what thy vertue, and thy worth haue done: Now shal my verse which thou in life didst grace, (And which was no disgrace for thee to do) Not leaue thee in the graue, that ougly place That few regard, or haue respect vnto, Where all attendance, and obseruance ends, Where all the Sunshine of our fauour sets, Where what was ill, no countenance defends, And what was good, th'vnthankfull world forgets. Here shalt thou haue the seruice of my pen (The tongue of my best thoughts) and in this case I cannot be supposde to flatter, when I speake behinde thy backe, not to thy face: Men neuer sooth the dead but where they do Find liuing tyes, to hold them therevnto. And I stand cleere from any other chaine Then of my loue which freeborne, draws free breath. The benefit thou gau'st me to sustaine My humble life, I loose it by thy death. Nor was it such, as it could lay on me Any exaction of respect so strong, As t'inforce m'obseruance, beyond thee, Or make my conscience differ from my tongue. Let those be vassals to such seruices Who have their hopes, or whose desires are hye, For me I haue my ends, and know it is For I haue learnt it is the property For free men to speake truth, for slaues to lye. And therefore I sincerely will report First how thy parts were faire conuaid within, How that braue minde was built and in what sort All thy contexture of thy heart hath beene, Which was so nobly fram'd, so well compos'd As vertue neuer had a fairer seate, Nor could be better lodg'd nor more repos'd, Then in that goodly frame; where all things sweete, And all things quiet, held a peacefull rest; Where passion did no suddaine tumults raise That might disturbe her, nor was euer brest Contain'd so much, and made so little noyse; That by thy silent modestie is found The emptiest vessells make the greatest sound. For thou so well discernd'st thy selfe, had'st read Man and his breath so well, as made thee force The lesse to speake, as being ordain'd to spread Thy selfe in action, rather than discourse; Though thou hadst made a generall Suruey Of all the best of mens best knowledges, And knew as much as euer learning knew, Yet did it make thee trust thy selfe the lesse, And lesse presume; and yet when being mou'd In priuate talke to speake, thou didst bewray How fully fraught thou wert within, and prou'd That thou didst know what euer wit could say; Which shew'd thou hadst not bookes as many haue For ostentation, but for vse, and that Thy bounteous memory was such, as gaue A large reuenue of the good, it gat. Witnesse so many volumes whereto thou Hast set thy notes vnder thy learned hand, And markt them with that print as will shew how The point of thy conceiuing thoughts did stand; That none would thinke if all thy life had beene, Turn'd into leisure, thou couldst haue attain'd So much of time, to haue perus'd and seene, So many volumes that so much contain'd. Which furniture may not be deem'd least rare Amongst those ornaments that sweetly dight Thy solitary Wansteed, where thy care Had gathered all what heart or eyes delight. And whereas many others haue, we see All things within their houses worth the sight, Except themselues, that furniture of thee And of thy presence, gaue the best delight. With such a season, such a temprature Wert thou compos'd, as made sweetnes one, And held the tenor of thy life still sure, In consort with thy selfe in perfect tone; And neuer man had heart more truely seru'd Vnder the regiment of his owne care And was more at command, and more obseru'd The colours of that modesty he bare Then that of thine, in whom men neuer found That any shew, or speech obscene, could tell Of any veine thou hadst that was vnsound, Or motion of thy powers, that turn'd not well. And this was thy prouision laid within, Thus wert thou to thy selfe, and now remaines. VVhat to the world thou outwardly hast beene, VVhat the dimension of that side containes, Which likewise was so goodly and so large As shewes that thou wert borne t'adorne the dayes Wherein thou liu'st, and also to discharge Those parts which Englands and thy fame should raise; Although in peace, thou seem'dst to be all peace Yet being in warre, thou wert all warre, and there As in thy spheere thy spirits did neuer cease To moue with indefatigable care And nothing seem'd more to arride thy heart Nor more inlarge thee into iollity, Then when thou sawest thy selfe in armour girt, Or any act of armes like to be nye. The Belgique warre first tride thy martiall spirit, And what thou wert and what thou wouldst be found And markt thee there according to thy merit With honors stampe, a deepe and noble wound. And that same place that rent from mortall men Immortall Sidney, glory of the field And glory of the Muses, and their pen (VVho equall bare the Caduce and the Shield) Had likewise bin thy last, had not the fate Of England then reseru'd thy worthy blood, Vnto the preseruation of a State That much concern'd her honour and her good; And thence return'd thee to inioy the blis Of grace and fauour in Elizaes sight (That miracle of women) who by this Made thee be held according to thy right; Which faire and happy blessing thou mightst well Haue farre more raisd had not thine enemy Retired priuacy, made thee to sell Thy greatnes for thy quiet, and deny To meet faire Fortune, when she came to thee. For neuer man did his preferment fly, And had it in that emminent degree, As thou, as if it fought thy modesty. For that which many, whom ambition toyles And tortures with their hopes, hardly attaine With all their thrusts, &amp; shouldring-plots, and wiles VVas easily made thine, without thy paine. And without any priuate malicing Or publique greeuance, euery good man ioy'd That vertue could come cleere to any thing, And faire deserts to be so fairely pay'd. Those benefits that were bestow'd on thee VVere not like fortunes fauours, they could see. Eliza's cleere-eied iudgement is renown'd For making choice of thy ability: But it will euerlastingly redound Vnto the glory, and benignity Of Britaines mighty Monarch, that thou wert By him aduanced for thy great desert; It being the fairer worke of maiesty With fauour to reward, than to employ. And as thou saidst that naught thy heart did grieue, In death so much, as that time would not yeeld Thee meanes to shew thy zeale, that thou mightst liue T'haue done but one dayes seruice in the field, And that faire bed of honour died vpon, And with thy bloud haue seald thy gratefulnesse To such a royall Maister. Who had done So much for thee t'aduance thy seruices; Which were indeed of that deseart, as they Might aske their grace themselues: yet do we see That to successe, desert hath not a way But vnder Princes that most gracious be, For without thy great valour we had lost The dearest purchase euer England made: And made with such profuse exceeding cost Of bloud and charge, to keepe and to inuade: As commutation paid a deerer price For such a peece of earth, and yet well paid And well aduentur'd for, with great aduice, And happily to our dominions laid; Without which out-let, England thou hadst bin From all the rest of th'earth shut out, and pent Vnto thy selfe, and forst to keepe within, Inuiron'd round with others gouernment; Where now by this, thy large imperiall Crowne Stands boundlesse in the West, and hath a way For noble times, left to make all thine owne That lyes beyond it, and force all t'obay. And this important peece, like t'haue beene rent From off thy state, did then so tickle stand, As that no ioynture of the gouernment But shooke, no ligament, no band Of order and obedience, but were then Loose and in tottering, when the charge Thereof was laid on Montioy, and that other men Checkt by example sought to put it off. And he out of his natiue modesty (As being no vndertaker) labours too To haue auoided that which his ability And Englands Genius would haue him do Alleadging how it was a charge vnfit For him to vndergo, seeing such a one As had more power and meanes t'accomplish it Then he could haue, had there so little done. VVhose ill successe (considering his great worth, Was such as could that mischiefe be withstood, It had beene wrought) did in it selfe bring forth Discouragement that he should do lesse good. The state replide, it was not lookt he should Restore it wholy to it selfe againe, But only now if possible he could In any fashion but the same retaine So that it did not fall a sunder quite, Being thus dishiuered in a desperate plight. With courage on he goes, doth exiquute With counsell, and returnes with victory; But in what noble fashion he did sute This action, with what wit and industry, Is not to be disgracde in this small carde: It askes a spacious Mappe of more regarde. Here is no roome to tell with what strange speed And secrecy he vsed to preuent The enemies designes, nor with what heed He marcht before report, where what he ment Fame neuer knew her selfe till it was done, His drifts and Rumor seldome being all one; Nor will this place conueniency afford To shew how he, when dismall winter stormes Keepes peace, and makes Mars sheath his sword, Toyles him abroad, and noble act performes; Nor how by mastring difficulties so In times vnusuall, and by passage hard He brauely came to disappoint his foe, And many times surpris'd him vnprepared. Yet let me touch one point of that great Act, That famous siege, the Master-worke of all, Where no distresse nor difficulties lackt T'afflict his weary tyred Campe with all. That when inclos'd by powerfull enemies One either side, with feeble troupes he lay Intrencht in myre, in colde, in miseries; Kept waking with Alarumes night and day. There were, who did aduise him, to withdraw His army to some place of safe defence, From the apparent perill which they saw Was to confound them, or to force them thence. For now the Spaniard had possest three ports The most important of this Ile say they, And sooner fresh supplyments, Spaine transports To them then England can to vs conuay; The Reble is in heart, and now is ioyn'd With some of them already, and doth stand Here ouer vs, with chiefest strength combin'd Of all the desperate forces of the land; And how vpon these disaduantages Your doubtfull troupes will fight your Honour guess. Th'vndaunted Montioy hereto answers this. My worthy friends, the charge of this great state And kingdome to my faith committed is, And I must all I can ingeniate To answere for the same, and render it Vpon as faire a reckning as I may; But if from hence I shall once stirre my feete, The kingdome is vndone, and lost this day. All will fly thither where they find is hart, And feare shal haue none stand to take his part; And how shal we answere our Country then At our returne, nay answere our owne fame? Which howsoeuer we haue done like men Will be imbranded with the marke of blame. And since we here are come vnto the point For which we toild so much and staid so long, Let vs not now our trauailes disappoint Of th'honour which doth thereunto belong. We cannot spend our blood more worthily Then in so faire a cause, and if we fall We fall with glory, and our worth thereby Shalbe renowned, and held deare of all. And for my part I count the field to be The honourablest bed to die vpon; And here your eies this day either see My body laid, or els this action done. The Lord the chiefe and soueraigne Generall Of Hosts, makes weake to stand, the strong to fall. With which braue resolution he so warm'd Their shaking courage, as they all in one Set to that noble worke; which they perform'd As gallantly as euer men haue done. Of which tis better nothing now to say, Then say too little: For there rests behind A Trophey to b'erected, that will stay To all posterities, and keepe in minde That glorious act which did a kingdome saue, Kept the Crowne whole and made the peace we haue. And now I will omit to shew therefore, His management of publike businesses: Which oft are vnder fortunes conduct more Then ours, and tell his priuate carriages; VVhich on his owne discretion did relie, VVherewith his spirit was furnisht happely. Milde, affable, and easie of accesse He was, but with a due reseruednes: So that the passage to his fauours lay Not common to all commers, nor yet was So narrow, but it gaue a gentle way To such as fitly might or ought to passe: Nor sold he smoke, nor tooke he vp to day Commodities of mens attendances, And of their hopes, to pay them with delay, And intertaine them with faire promises. But as a man that lou'd no great commerce With businesse, and with noise, he euer flies That Maze of many waies, which might disperse Him, into other mens vncertainties. And with a quiet calme sincerity, H'effects his vndertakings really. His tongue and heart did not turne-backes, but went One way, and kept one course with what he ment. He vs'd no maske at all, but euer ware His honest inclination open fac'd, The friendships that he vou'd, most constant were, And with great iudgment, and discretion plac'd. And Deuonshire thy faith hath her reward, Thy noblest friends do not forsake thee now, After thy death, but beare a kind regard, Vnto thine honour in the Graue, and show, That worthinesse, which merits to remaine Among th'examples of integrity; Whereby themselues no doubt shall also gaine, A like regard vnto their memory. Now muttering enuy, what canst thou produce To darken the bright luster of such parts? Cast thy pure stone, exempt from all abuse. Say what defects could weigh downe these deserts? Summon detraction, to obiect the worst That may be told, and vtter all it can. It cannot find a blemish to b'inforst, Against him, other, then he was a man, And built of flesh and blood, and did liue here Within the region of infirmity; VVhere all perfections neuer did appeare, To meet in any one so really, But that his frailty euer did bewray Vnto the world, that he was set in clay. But yet his vertues, and his worthinesse Being seene so farre aboue his weaknesse, Must euer shine, whilst th'other vnder ground, With his fraile part, shall neuer more be found And gratitude, and charity I know, Will keepe no note, nor memory will haue, Of any fault committed, but will now Be pleasd, to bring all within his Graue. Seeing only such stand euer base and low That strike the dead, or mutter vnder-hand: And as dogges bark at those they do not know, So they at such they do not vnderstand. The worthier sort, who know we do not liue With perfect men, will neuer be so vnkinde; They will the right to the disceased giue, Knowing themselues must likewise leaue behind, Those that will censure them. And they know how, The Lyon being dead euen Hares insult. And will not vrge a passed error now, Whenas he hath no party to consult, Nor tongue, nor aduocate, to shew his minde: They rather will lament the losse they finde, By such a noble member of that worth, And know how rare the world such men brings forth. For neuer none had heart more truly seru'd, Vnder the regiment of his own care, And was none at command, and none obseru'd The coullours of that honesty he bare, Then that of his: who neuer more was knowne; To vse immodest act, or speech obscene, Or any leuity that might haue showne, The touch but of a thought that was vncleane. So that what euer he hath done amisse, Was vnderneath a shape that was not knowne; As Iupiter did no vnworthinesse, But was in other formes, not in his owne. But let it now sufficient be, that I, The last Scene of his act of life bewray; Which giues th'applause to all, doth glorifie The worke. For t'is the euening crownes the day. This action of our death especially Shewes all a man. Here only is he found. With what munition he did fortifie His heart, how good his furniture hath bin. And this did he performe in gallant wise: In this did he confirme his worthinesse. For on the morrow after the surprise That sicknes made on him with fierce accesse, He told his faithfull friend whom he held deere (And whose great worth was worthy so to be) How that he knew those hot diseases were Of that contagious force, as he did see That men were ouer-tumbled sudainly, And therefore did desire to set a course And order t'his affaires as speedily; As might be, ere his sicknes should grow worse: And as for death, said he, I do not wey, I am resolu'd and ready in this case. It cannot come t'affright me any way, Let it looke neuer with so grim a face: And I will meete it smiling, for I know, How vaine a thing all this worlds glory is. And herein did he keepe his word. Did show Indeede as he had promised in this. For sicknesse neuer heard him grone at all, Nor with a sigh consent to shew his paine; Which howsoeuer being tirannicall, He sweetly made it looke, and did retaine A louely countenance of his being well, And so would euer make his tongue to tell. Although the feruour of extremity, Which often doth throw those defences downe, VVhich in our health, wall in infirmity, Might open lay more then we would haue knowne: Yet did no idle word in him bewray Any one peece of nature ill set in; Those lightnesses that any thing will say Could say no ill of what they knew within; Such a sure locke of silent modesty VVas set in life vpon that noble heart As that no anguish, nor extremity Could open it t'impaire that worthy part. For hauing dedicated still the same Vnto deuotion, and to sacred skill, That furnish perfect held, that blessed flame Continued to the last in feruour still. And when his spirit and tongue, no longer could Do any certaine seruices beside, Euen at the point of parting, they vnfold VVith feruent zeale, how only he relide Vpon the merits of the precious death Of his redeemer; and with rapt desires H'appeales to grace, his soule deliuereth Vnto the hand of mercy, and expires. Thus did that worthy, who most vertuously And mildly liu'd, most sweete, and mildly dy. And thus Great Patrone of my muse haue I Paid thee my vowes and fairely cleer'd the accounts VVhich in my loue I owe thy memory. And let me say that herein there amounts Something vnto thy fortune, that thou hast This monument of thee, perhaps may last. Which doth not t'euery mighty man befall: For loe how many when they die, die all. And this doth argue too, thy great deserts, For honour neuer brought vnworthinesse Further then to the graue, and there it parts And leaues mens greatnes to forgetfulnes. And we do see that nettles, thistles, brakes (The poorest workes of nature) tread vpon The proudest frames that mans inuention makes, To hold his memory when he is gone. But Deuonshire thou hast another Tombe Made by thy vertues in a safer roome. Samvel Daniell. FINIS. VII. CERTAINE EPISTLES. 1601–3. TO S?. THOMAS EGERTON Knight, Lord Keeper of the Great seale of England. Well hath the pow'rfull hand of Maiesty, Thy worthines, and Englands hap beside, Set thee in th'aidfull'st roome of dignity, As th'Isthmus, these two Oceans to diuide, Of Rigor and confus'd Vncerteinty; To keepe out th'entercourse of wrong and pride, That they ingulph not vp vnsuccoured right By the extreme current of licencious might. Now when we see the most combining band, The strongest fastning of society, Law; whereon all this frame of men doth stand, Remaine concussed with vncerteinty, And seeme to foster rather than withstand Contention, and embrace obscurity, Only t'afflict, and not to fashion vs, Making her cure farre worse than the disease; As if she had made couenant with Wrong, To part the prey made on our weaknesses, And suffred Falshood to be arm'd as strong Vnto the combate, as is Righteousnesse, Or suted her, as if she did belong Vnto our passions, and did euen professe Contention, as her only mystery, Which she restraines not, but doth multiply. Was she the same sh'is now in ages past? Or was she lesse when she was vsed lesse: And growes as malice growes, and so comes cast Iust to the forme of our vnquietnesse? Or made more slow, the more that strife runs fast, Staying t'vndo vs ere she will redresse? That th'ill she checks seemes suffred to be ill, When it yeelds greater gaine than goodnes will. Must there be still some discord mixed among The Harmony of men? whose mood accords Best with Contention, tun'd t'a note of wrong, That when warre failes, peace must make warre with words, And b'arm'd vnto destruction euen as strong, As were in ages past our ciuill swords; Making as deepe, although vnbleeding wounds, That whenas fury failes, wisdome confounds. If it be wisdome, and not cunning, this Which so imbroiles the state of truth with brawles, And wraps it vp in strange confusednesse, As if it liu'd immur'd within the walls Of hideous termes, fram'd out of barbarousnesse And forren customes, the memorialls Of our subiection, and could neuer be Deliu'red but by wrangling subtilty. Whereas it dwells free in the open plaine, Vncurious, Gentle, easie of accesse; Certaine vnto it selfe, of equall vaine, One face, one colour, one assurednesse: It's falshood that is intricate and vaine, And needes these labyrinths of subtlenesse: For where the cunningst cou'rings most appeare, It argues still that all is not sincere. Which thy cleere-ey'd experience well discries Great Keeper of the state of Equity, Refuge of mercy, vpon whom relies The succour of oppressed misery; Altar of safegard, whereto affliction flies From th'eager pursuit of seuerity; Hauen of peace, that labour'st to withdraw Iustice from out the tempests of the Law. And set her in a calme and euen way, Plaine, and directly leading to redresse, Barring these counter-courses of delay, These wasting dilatory processes: Ranging into their right and proper ray, Errors, demurs, essoines, and trauerses; The heads of Hydra springing out of death, That giues this monster, Malice, still new breath. That what was made for the vtility And good of man, might not be turn'd t'his hurt, To make him worser by his remedy, And cast him downe, with what should him support: Nor that the state of Law might lose thereby The due respect, and reu'rence of her port; And seeme a trap to catch our ignorance, And to intangle our intemperance. Since her interpretations and our deeds Vnto a like infinity arise, As being a Science, that by nature breeds Contention, striefe, and ambiguities: For altercation controuersie feeds, And in her agitation multiplies: The field of Cauill lying all like wide, Yeelds like aduantage vnto either side. Which made the graue Castillian king deuise Ferdinand king of Castile (1601.)A prohibition, that no Aduocate Should be conuai'd to th'Indian Colonies, Lest their new setting, shaken with debate, Might take but slender root, and so not rise To any perfect grow'th of firme estate: For hauing not this skill, how to contend, Th'vnnourisht strife wold quickly make an end. So likewise did th'Hungarian, when he saw The king of Hungarie.These great Italian Bartolists, who were Call'd in of purpose to explane the Law, T'imbroile it more, and make it much lesse cleere; Caus'd them from out his kingdom to withdraw With this infestious skill, some other-where: Difficultatem facit doctrina. Whose learning, rather let men farther out, And opened wider passages of doubt. Seeing euen Iniustice may be regulare, And no proportion can there be betwixt Our actions, which in endlesse motion are, And th'ordinances which are alwayes fixt; Ten thousand lawes more can not reach so far, But malice goes beyond, or liues immixt So close with goodnesse, as it euer will Corrupt, disguise, or counterfet it still. And therefore did those glorious Monarchs, (who Diuide with God the stile of Maiesty For being good, and had a care to do The world right, and succour honesty) Ordaine this sanctuary, whereunto Th'opprest might flie, this seat of Equity; Whereon thy vertues sit with faire renowne, The greatest grace and glory of the Gowne. Which Equity, being the soule of law, The life of iustice, and the spirit of right, Dwell's not in written lines, or liues in awe Of bookes: deafe powers, that haue nor eares nor sight But out of well-weigh'd circumstance doth draw The essence of a iudgement requisit; And is that Lesbian square, that building fit, Plies to the worke, not forc'th the worke to it. Maintaining still an equall paralell, Iust with th'occasions of humanity; Making her iudgement euer liable To the respect of peace and amity; When surely Law, sterne, and vnaffable, Cares only but it selfe to satisfie: And often innocencies scarce defends, As that which on no circumstance depends. But Equity, that beares an euen raine Vpon the present courses, holds in aw, By giuing hand a little, and doth gaine By a gentle relaxation of the law; And yet inuiolable doth maintaine The end whereto all constitutions draw; Which is the well-fare of society, Consisting of an vpright policy: Which first being by necessity compos'd, Necessitas est lex temporis.Is by necessity maintain'd in best estate; Where, whenas iustice shall be ill dispos'd, It sickens the whole body of the State: For if there be a passage once disclos'd, That Wrong may enter at the selfe-same gate Which serues for Right, clad in a coate of Law, What violent distempers may it draw: And therefore do'st thou stand to keepe the way, And stop the course that malice seekes to run, And by thy prouident Iniunctions stay This neuer ending Altercation; Sending contention home, to the end men may There make their peace whereas their strife begun, And free these pestred streets they vainely weare, Whom both the state, and theirs, do need elsewhere. Lest th'humor which doth thus predominate Conuert vnto it selfe all that it takes; And that the law grow larger than debate, And come t'exceede th'affaires it vndertakes: As if the only Science of the State That tooke vp all our wits for gaine it makes; Not for the good that thereby may be wrought, Which is not good if it be dearely bought. What shall we thinke whenas ill causes shall Inrich men more, and shall be more desir'd Than good, as farre more beneficiall? Who then defends the good? Who will be hir'd To entertaine a right, whose gaine is small? A Remedie for defending ill causes. Vnlesse the Aduocate that hath conspir'd To plead a wrong, be likewise made to runne His Clients chance, and with him be vndone. So did the wisest nations euer striue To binde the hands of Iustice vp so hard, That lest she falling to proue Lucratiue Might basely reach them out to take reward: Ordaining her prouisions fit to liue Out of the publike, as a publike guard That all preserues, and all doth entertaine, Whose end is only glory, and not gaine. That eu'n the Scepter which might all command, Seeing her s'vnpartiall, equall regular, Was pleas'd to put it selfe into her hand, Whereby they both grew more admired far. And this is that great blessing of this land, That both the Prince and people vse one Barre; The Prince, whose cause (as not to be withstood) Is neuer bad but where himselfe is good. This is that ballance which committed is To thy most euen and religious hand, Great Minister of Iustice, who by this Shalt haue thy name still gracious in this land: This is that seale of pow'r which doth impresse Thy acts of right, which shall for euer stand: This is that traine of State, that pompously Attends vpon thy reu'rent dignity. All glory els besides ends with our breath, And mens respects, scarce brings vs to our graue: But this of doing good, must out liue Death, And haue a right out of the right it gaue: Though th'act but few, th'example profiteth Thousands, that shall thereby a blessing haue. The worlds respect growes not but on desarts, Pow'r may haue knees, but iustice hath our hearts. TO THE LORD HENRIE HOWARD, one of his Maiesties Priuy Councell. Praise, if it be not choice, and layd aright, Can yeeld no lustre where it is bestow'd, Nor any way can grace the giuers Art, (Tho'it be a pleasing colour to delight) For that no ground whereon it can be shew'd Will beare it well, but Vertue and Desart. And though I might commend your learning, wit, And happy vttrance; and commend them right, As that which decks you much, and giues you grace, Yet your cleere iudgement best deserueth it; Which in your course hath carried you vpright, And made you to discerne the truest face, And best complexion of the things that breed The reputation and the loue of men; And held you in the tract of honesty, Which euer in the end we see succeed; Though oft it may haue interrupted beene Both by the times and mens iniquity. For sure those actions which do fairely runne In the right line of honour, still are those That get most cleane and safest to their end, And passe the best without confusion, Either in those that act or els dispose, Hauing the scope made cleere, whereto they tend. When this by-path of cunning doth s'imbroile And intricate the passage of affaires, As that they seldome fairely can get out; But cost, with lesse successe, more care and toyle, Whil'st doubt and the distrusted cause impaires Their courage, who would els appeare more stout. For though some hearts are blinded so, that they Haue diuers doores whereby they may let out Their wills abroad without disturbancy, Int'any course, and into eu'ry way Of humor that affection turnes about; Yet haue the best but one t'haue passage by, And that so surely warded with the gard Of conscience and respect, as nothing must Haue course that way, but with the certaine passe Of a perswasiue right; which being compar'd With their conceit, must thereto answere iust, And so with due examination passe. Which kind of men, rais'd of a better frame, Are meere religious, constant and vpright, And bring the ablest hands for any effect, And best beare vp the reputation, fame, And good opinion, that the action's right When th'vndertakers are without suspect: But when the body of an enterprize Shall go one way, the face another way, As if it did but mocke a weaker trust, The motion being monstrous, can not rise To any good, but falls downe to bewray, That all pretences serue for things vniust; Especially where th'action will allow Apparency, or that it hath a course Concentrike with the vniuersall frame Of men combin'd; whom it concerneth how These motions runne, and entertaine their force; Hauing their being resting on the same. And be it, that the vulgar are but grosse, Yet are they capable of truth, and see, And sometimes gesse the right, and do conceiue The nature of that text that needs a glosse, And wholy neuer can deluded be: All may a few, few cannot all deceiue. And these strange disproportions in the traine And course of things doe euermore proceed From th'ill-set disposition of their mindes, Who in their actions cannot but retaine Th'incumbred formes which doe within them breed, And which they cannot shew but in their kindes. Whereas the wayes and counsels of the light So sort with valour and with manlinesse, As that they carry things assuredlie Vndazling of their owne or others sight: There being a blessing that doth giue successe To worthinesse and vnto constancie. And though sometimes th'euent may fall amisse, Yet shall it still haue honour for th'attempt, When craft begins with feare and ends with shame, And in the whole designe perplexed is; Vertue, though lucklesse, yet shall scape contempt, And though it hath not hap, it shall haue fame. TO THE LADIE MARGARET Countesse of Cumberland. He that of such a height hath built his minde, And rear'd the dwelling of his thoughts so strong, As neither feare nor hope can shake the frame Of his resolued powr's, nor all the winde Of vanitie or malice pierce to wrong His setled peace, or to disturbe the same; What a faire seate hath he, from whence he may The boundlesse wastes and wildes of man suruay. And with how free an eye doth he looke downe Vpon these lower regions of turmoyle! Where all the stormes of passions mainly beat On flesh and bloud; where honour, pow'r, renowne Are onely gay afflictions, golden toyle; Where greatnesse stands vpon as feeble feet As frailty doth, and onely great doth seeme To little minds, who doe it so esteeme. He lookes vpon the mightiest Monarchs warres But onely as on stately robberies; Where euermore the fortune that preuailes Must be the right; the ill-succeeding marres The fairest and the best-fac't enterprize: Great Pirat Pompey lesser Pirats quailes; Iustice, he sees, as if seduced, still Conspires with pow'r, whose cause must not be ill. He sees the face of Right t'appeare as manifolde As are the passions of vncertaine man; Who puts it in all colours, all attires, To serue his ends and make his courses holde: He sees, that let Deceit worke what it can, Plot and contriue base wayes to high desires; That the all-guiding Prouidence doth yet All disappoint, and mocks this smoake of wit. Nor is he mou'd with all the thunder-cracks Of Tyrants threats, or with the surly brow Of power, that proudly sits on others crimes, Charg'd with more crying sinnes then those he checks; The stormes of sad confusion, that may grow Vp in the present, for the comming times, Appall not him, that hath no side at all But of himselfe, and knowes the worst can fall. Although his heart so neere allied to earth, Cannot but pitty the perplexed State Of troublous and distrest mortalitie, That thus make way vnto the ougly birth Of their owne sorrowes, and doe still beget Affliction vpon imbecillitie: Yet seeing thus the course of things must runne, He lookes thereon, not strange, but as foredone. And whilst distraught Ambition compasses And is incompast; whil'st as craft deceiues And is deceiued; whil'st man doth ransacke man, And builds on bloud, and rises by distresse; And th'inheritance of desolation leaues To great expecting hopes; he lookes thereon As from the shore of peace with vnwet eie, And beares no venture in impietie. Thus, Madam, fares that man that hath prepar'd A rest for his desires, and sees all things Beneath him, and hath learn'd this booke of man, Full of the notes of frailty, and compar'd The best of glory with her sufferings: By whom I see you labour all you can To plant your heart, and set your thoughts as neare His glorious mansion as your pow'rs can beare. Which, Madam, are so soundly fashioned By that cleere iudgement that hath carryed you Beyond the feeble limits of your kinde, As they can stand against the strongest head Passion can make; inur'd to any hue The world can cast; that cannot cast that minde Out of her forme of goodnesse, that doth see Both what the best and worst of earth can be. Which makes, that whatsoeuer here befalles You in the region of your selfe remaine; Where no vaine breath of th'impudent molests, That hath secur'd within the brasen walles Of a cleere conscience, that without all staine Rises in peace, in innocencie rests; Whilst all what malice from without procures, Shewes her owne ougly heart, but hurts not yours. And whereas none reioyce more in reuenge Then women vse to doe; yet you well know, That wrong is better checkt, by being contemn'd Then being pursu'd: leauing to him t'auenge To whom it appertaines; wherein you show How worthily your cleerenesse hath condemn'd Base malediction, liuing in the darke, That at the raies of goodnesse still doth barke. Knowing the heart of man is set to be The centre of this world, about the which These reuolutions of disturbances Still roule; where all th'aspects of miserie Predominate; whose strong effects are such As he must beare, being pow'rlesse to redresse; And that vnlesse aboue himselfe he can Erect himselfe, how poore a thing is man! And how turmoyl'd they are, that leuell lie With earth, and cannot lift themselues from thence; That neuer are at peace with their desires, But worke beyond their yeeres, and euen denie Dotage her rest, and hardly will dispence With death: that when ability expires, Desire liues still: so much delight they haue To carry toyle and trauell to the graue. Whose ends you see, and what can be the best They reach vnto, when they haue cast the summe And reckonings of their glory; and you know This floting life hath but this Port of rest, A heart prepar'd, that feares no ill to come: And that mans greatnesse rests but in his show; The best of all whose dayes consumed are Either in warre, or peace conceiuing warre. This concord, Madame, of a well-tun'd minde Hath beene so set, by that all-working hand Of heauen, that though the world hath done his worst To put it out, by discords most vnkinde; Yet doth it still in perfect vnion stand With God and man, nor euer will be forc't From that most sweet accord, but still agree Equall in Fortunes inequalitie. And this note (Madame) of your worthinesse Remaines recorded in so many hearts, As time nor malice cannot wrong your right In th'inheritance of Fame you must possesse; You that haue built you by your great deserts, Out of small meanes, a farre more exquisit And glorious dwelling for your honoured name Then all the gold that leaden minds can frame. S. D. TO THE LADIE LVCIE Countesse of Bedford. Though vertue be the same when low she stands, In th'humble shadowes of obscuritie, As when she either sweats in martiall bands, Or sits in Court clad with authoritie; Yet, Madam, doth the strictnesse of her roome Greatly detract from her abilitie: For as in-wall'd within a liuing tombe, Her hands and armes of action, labour not; Her thoughts, as if abortiue from the wombe, Come neuer borne, though happily begot, But where she hath mounted in open sight An eminent and spacious dwelling got. Where shee may stirre at will, and vse her might, There is she more her selfe, and more her owne; There in the faire attire of honor dight, She sits at ease and makes her glory knowne: Applause attends her hands, her deeds haue grace, Her worth new-borne is strait as if full growne. With such a godly and respected face Doth vertue looke, that's set to looke from hie; And such a faire aduantage by her place Hath state and greatnesse to doe worthily. And therefore well did your high fortunes meet With her, that gracing you, comes grac't thereby: And well was let into a house so sweet, So good, so faire, so faire so good a guest; Who now remaines as blessed in her seat, As you are with her residencie blest. And this faire course of knowledge whereunto Your studies, learned Lady, are addrest, Is th'only certaine way that you can go Vnto true glory, to true happinesse: All passages on earth besides, are so Incumbred with such vaine disturbances; As still we lose our rest in seeking it, Being but deluded with apparances; And no key had you else that was so fit T'vnlocke that prison of your sex, as this, To let you out of weaknesse, and admit Your powers into the freedome of that blisse That sets you there where you may ouer-see This rowling world, and view it as it is; And apprehend how th'outsides doe agree With th'inward, being of the things we deeme And hold in our ill-cast accounts, to be Of highest value and of best esteeme; Since all the good we haue rests in the minde, By whose proportions onely we redeeme Our thoughts from out confusion, and doe finde The measure of our selues, and of our pow'rs; And that all happinesse remaines confinde Within the Kingdome of this breast of ours: Without whose boundes all that we looke on lies In others iurisdictions, others pow'rs, Out of the circuit of our liberties. All glory, honor, fame, applause, renowne, Are not belonging to our royalties, But t'others wils, wherein th'are onely growne: And that vnlesse we find vs all within, We neuer can without vs be our owne, Nor call it right our life that we liue in: But a possession held for others vse, That seeme to haue most int'rest therein; Which we doe so disseuer, part, traduce, Let out to custome, fashion, and to shew, As we enioy but onely the abuse, And haue no other deed at all to shew. How oft are we constrained to appeare With other countenance then that we owe, And be our selues farre off, when we are neere! How oft are we forc't on a cloudie hart To set a shining face, and make it cleere; Seeming content to put our selues apart, To beare a part of others weakenesses! As if we onely were compos'd by Art, Not Nature, and did all our deeds addresse T'opinion, not t'a conscience, what is right: As fram'd b'example, not aduisednesse, Into those formes that entertaine our sight. And though books, Madam, cannot make this minde Which we must bring apt to be set aright, Yet doe they rectifie it in that kinde, And touch it so, as that it turnes that way Where iudgement lies: and though we cannot find The certaine place of truth, yet doe they stay And entertaine vs neere about the same; And giue the soule the best delight that may Encheere it most, and most our spirits inflame To thoughts of glory, and to worthy ends: And therefore in a course that best became The cleerenesse of your heart, and best commends Your worthy pow'rs, you run the rightest way That is on earth, that can true glory giue; By which when all consumes, your fame shal liue. TO THE LADIE ANNE Clifford. Vnto the tender youth of those faire eies The light of iudgement can arise but new; And yong the world appeares t'a yong conceit, Whil'st thorow the vnacquainted faculties The late inuested soule doth rawly view Those obiects which on that discretion wait. Yet you that such a faire aduantage haue Both by your birth and happy pow'rs, t'out go, And be before your yeeres, can fairely guesse What hue of life holdes surest without staine; Hauing your well-wrought heart full furnish't so With all the images of worthinesse, As there is left no roome at all t'inuest Figures of other forme but sanctitie: Whilst yet those cleane-created thoughts, within The Garden of your innocencies rest; Where are no motions of deformitie, Nor any doore at all to let them in. With so great care doth she, that hath brought forth That comely body, labour to adorne That better part, the mansion of your minde, With all the richest furniture of worth; To make y'as highly good as highly borne, And set your vertues equall to your kinde. She tels you how that honour onely is A goodly garment put on faire desarts; Wherein the smallest staine is greatest seene, And that it cannot grace vnworthinesse; But more apparant shewes defectiue parts, How gay soeuer they are deckt therein. She tels you too, how that it bounded is, And kept inclosed with so many eies, As that it cannot stray and breake abroad Into the priuate wayes of carelesnesse; Nor euer may descend to vulgarize, Or be below the sphere of her abode. But like to those supernall bodies set Within their Orbs, must keepe the certaine course Of order, destin'd to their proper place; Which onely doth their note of glory get. Th'irregular apparances inforce A short respect, and perish without grace: Being Meteors seeming high, but yet low plac't, Blazing but while their dying matters last: Nor can we take the iust height of the minde, But by that order which her course doth shew, And which such splendor to her actions giues; And thereby men her eminencie finde, And thereby onely doe attaine to know The Region, and the Orbe wherein she liues. For low in th'aire of grosse vncertaintie Confusion onely rowles, order sits hie. And therefore since the dearest thinge on earth, This honour, Madam, hath his stately frame From th'heau'nly order, which begets respect; And that your Nature, vertue, happy birth, Haue therein highly interplac'd your name, You may not runne the least course of neglect, For where, not to obserue, is to prophane Your dignity; how carefull must you be To be your selfe? And though you may to all Shine faire aspects, yet must the vertuous gaine The best effects of your benignitie: Nor must your common graces cause to fall The price of your esteeme t'a lower rate, Then doth befit the pitch of your estate. Nor may you build on your sufficiencie, For in our strongest parts we are but weake; Nor yet may ouermuch distrust the same: Lest that you come to checke it so thereby, As silence may become worse then to speake; Though silence women neuer ill became. And none we see were euer ouerthrowne By others flattery more then by their owne. For though we liue amongst the tongues of praise, And troopes of smoothing people that collaud All that we doe, yet 'tis within our harts Th'ambushment lies, that euermore betraies Our iudgements, when our selues be come t'applaud Our owne abilitie and our owne parts. So that we must not onely fence this fort Of ours, against all others fraud, but most Against our owne; whose danger is the most, Because we lie the neerest to doe hurt, And soon'st deceiue our selues, and soon'st are lost By our best pow'rs, that doe vs most transport. Such are your holy bounds, who must conuay (If God so please) the honourable bloud Of Clifford, and of Russell, led aright To many worthy stems; whose ofspring may Looke backe with comfort, to haue had that good To spring from such a branch that grew s'vpright; Since nothing cheeres the heart of greatnesse more Then th'Ancestors faire glory gone before. TO HENRY VVRIOTHESLY Earle of Southamton. Non fert vllum ictum illæfa fœlicitas. He who hath neuer warr'd with miserie, Nor euer tugg'd with Fortune and distresse, Hath had n'occasion nor no field to trie The strength and forces of his worthinesse: Those parts of iudgement which felicitie Keepes as conceal'd, affliction must expresse; And onely men shew their abilities, And what they are, in their extremities. The world had neuer taken so full note Of what thou art, hadst thou not beene vndone; And onely thy affliction hath begot More fame, then thy best fortunes could haue done; For euer, by aduersitie are wrought The greatest workes of admiration. And all the faire examples of renowne Out of distresse and miserie are growne. Mutius the fire, the tortures Regulus, Did make the miracles of faith and zeale, Exile renown'd, and grac'd Rutilius; Imprisonment and poyson did reueale The worth of Socrates; Fabritius' Pouertie did grace that Common-weale More then all Syllaes riches, got with strife; And Catoes death did vie with Cæsars life. Not to b'vnhappy is vnhappynesse; And misery not t'haue knowne miserie: For the best way vnto discretion, is The way that leades vs by aduersitie. And men are better shew'd what is amisse, By th'expert finger of calamitie, Then they can be with all that Fortune brings; Who neuer shewes them the true face of things. How could we know that thou could'st haue indur'd With a reposed cheere, wrong and disgrace; And with a heart and countenance assur'd Haue lookt sterne death and horror in the face! How should we know thy soule had beene secur'd In honest counsels and in way vnbase! Hadst thou not stood to shew vs what thou wert, By thy affliction, that discri'd thy heart. It is not but the Tempest that doth show The Sea-mans cunning; but the field that tries The Captaines courage: and we come to know Best what men are, in their worst ieoperdies: For lo, how many haue we seene to grow To high renowne from lowest miseries, Out of the hands of death, and many a one T'haue beene vndone, had they not beene vndone. He that indures for what his conscience knowes Not to be ill, doth from a patience hie Looke onely on the cause whereto he owes Those sufferings, not on his miserie: The more h'endures, the more his glory growes, Which neuer growes from imbecillitie: Onely the best compos'd and worthiest harts God sets to act the hardest and constant'st parts. S. D. VIII. Musophilus, or Defence of all Learning. 1602–3. To the right VVorthy and Iudicious Fauorer of Vertue, Master Fulke Greuill. I doe not here vpon this hum'rous Stage, Bring my transformed Verse, apparelled With others passions, or with others rage; With loues, with wounds, with factions furnished: But here present thee, onely modelled In this poore frame, the forme of mine owne heart: Where, to reuiue my selfe, my Muse is led With motions of her owne, t'act her owne part; Striuing to make her now contemned Art, As faire t'her selfe as possibly she can; Lest, seeming of no force, of no desert, She might repent the course that she began; And, with these times of dissolution, fall From Goodnesse, Vertue, Glory, Fame and all. MVSOPHILVS Containing, A generall Defence of all Learning. Philocosmus. Fond man Musophilus, that thus dost spend, In an vngainefull Arte thy deerest dayes, Tyring thy wits, and toyling to no end, But to attaine that idle smoake of Praise: Now when this busie world cannot attend Th'vntimely Musicke of neglected layes. Other delights then these, other desires This wiser profit-seeking Age requires. Musophilus. Friend Philocosmus, I confesse indeede, I loue this sacred Arte thou sett'st so light, And though it neuer stand my life in steede, It is enough, it giues my selfe delight; The whiles my vnafflicted minde doth feede On no vnholy thoughts for benefit. Be it, that my vnseasonable Song Come out of time; that fault is in the Time, And I must not doe Vertue so much wrong, As loue her aught the worse for others crime: And yet I finde some blessed spirits among, That cherish me, and like, and grace my Rime. Againe, that I doe more in Soule esteeme, Then all the gaine of dust the world doth craue: And, if I may attaine, but to redeeme My name from Dissolution and the Graue; I shall haue done enough, and better deeme T'haue liu'd to be, then to haue dide to haue. Short-breath'd Mortalitie would yet extend That spanne of life so farre forth as it may, And robbe her Fate; seeke to beguile her end Of some few lingring dayes of after-stay, That all this little All, might not descend Into the darke, a vniuersall pray. And giue our labours yet this poore delight, That when our daies doe end, they are not done: And though we die, we shall not perish quite, But liue two liues, where other haue but one. Philocosmus. Silly desires of selfe-abusing man, Striuing to gaine th'inheritance of Aire, That hauing done the vttermost he can, Leaues yet, perhaps, but beggarie to his heire: All that great purchase of the breath he wan, Feedes not his race, or makes his house more faire. And what art thou the better, thus to leaue A multitude of words to small effect, Which other times may scorne, and so deceiue Thy promis'd name, of what thou dost expect? Besides, some viperous Criticke may bereaue Th'opinion of thy worth for some defect; And get more reputation of his wit, By, but controlling of some word or sence, Then thou shalt honour for contriuing it, With all thy trauell, care and diligence; Being Learning now enough to contradict, And censure others with bold insolence. Besides, so many so confusedly sing, Whose diuerse discords haue the Musicke mar'd, And in contempt that mysterie doth bring, That he must sing alowd that will be heard: And the receiu'd opinion of the thing, For some vnhallowed string that vildely iar'd, Hath so vnseason'd now the eares of men, That who doth touch the tenour of that vaine, Is held but vaine; and his vnreckned pen The title but of Leuitie doth gaine. A poore light gaine, to recompence their toyle, That thought to get Eternitie the while. And therefore, leaue the left and out-worne course Of vnregarded wayes, and labour how To fit the times with what is most in force; Be new with mens affections that are new; Striue not to runne an idle counter-course, Out from the scent of humours, men allow. For not discreetly to compose our partes Vnto the frame of men (which we must be) Is to put off our selues, and make our Artes Rebels to Nature and Societie; Whereby we come to burie our desarts, In th'obscure graue of Singularitie. Musophilus. Doe not prophane the worke of doing well, Seduced man, that canst not looke so hie From out that mist of earth, as thou canst tell The wayes of Right, which Vertue doth descrie; That ouer-lookes the base contemptibly, And low-laid follies of Mortalitie: Nor mete out Truth and right-discerning Praise, By that wrong measure of Confusion, The vulgar foote; that neuer takes his wayes By Reason, but by Imitation, Rowling on with the rest; and neuer weighs The course which he should goe, but what is gone. Well were it with Mankinde, if, what the most Did like, were best: But Ignorance will liue By others square, as by example lost: And man to man must th'hand of Errour giue That none can fall alone, at their owne cost; And all, because men iudge not, but beleeue. For what poore bounds haue they, whom but th'earth bounds; What is their end whereto their care attaines, When the thing got, relieues not, but confounds, Hauing but trauell to succeede their paines? What ioy hath he of liuing, that propounds Affliction but his end, and Griefe his gaines? Gath'ring, incroching, wresting, ioyning to, Destroying, building, decking, furnishing, Repayring, altring, and so much adoe, To his soules toyle, and bodies trauelling: And all this doth he, little knowing who Fortune ordaines to haue th'inheriting. And his faire house rais'd hie in Enuies eie; Whose Pillars rear'd (perhaps) on bloud and wrong, The spoyles and pillage of Iniquitie: Who can assure it to continue long? If Rage spar'd not the walles of Pietie, Shall the prophanest pyles of sinne keepe strong? How many proud aspiring Pallaces Haue we knowne, made the prey of wrath and pride; Leuell'd with th'earth, left to forgetfulnesse; Whilst titlers their pretended rights decide, Or ciuill tumults, or an orderlesse Order, pretending change of some strong side? Then where is that proud Title of thy name, Written in yce of melting vanitie? Where is thine heire left to possesse the same? Perhaps, not so well as in beggarie. Something may rise to be beyond the shame Of vile and vnregarded Pouertie. Which I confesse, although I often striue To clothe in the best habit of my skill, In all the fairest colours I can giue: Yet for all that, me thinkes she lookes but ill. I cannot brooke that face, which dead-aliue Shewes a quicke body, but a buried will. Yet oft we see the barres of this restraint Holdes goodnesse in, which loose wealth would let flie; And fruitlesse riches barriner then want, Brings forth small worth from idle Libertie: Which when Disorders shall againe make scant, It must refetch her state from Pouertie. But yet in all this interchange of all, Vertue we see, with her faire grace, stands fast: For what high races hath there come to fall, With low disgrace, quite vanished and past, Since Chaucer liu'd; who yet liues, and yet shall, Though (which I grieue to say) but in his last. Yet what a time hath he wrested from Time, And wonne vpon the mighty waste of dayes, Vnto th'immortall honour of our clime! That by his meanes came first adorn'd with Bayes; Vnto the sacred Relickes of whose rime, We yet are bound in zeale to offer praise? And, could our lines, begotten in this age, Obtaine but such a blessed hand of yeares, And scape the fury of that threatning rage, Which in confused cloudes gastly appeares; Who would not straine his trauels to ingage, When such true glory should succeede his cares? But whereas he came planted in the Spring, And had the Sunne, before him, of Respect: We, set in th'Autumne, in the withering And sullen season of a cold defect, Must taste those sowre distasts the times do bring Vpon the fulnesse of a cloy'd Neglect; Although the stronger constitutions shall Weare out th'infection of distempred dayes, And come with glory to out-liue this fall: Recou'ring of another springing of Praise, Cleer'd from th'oppresing humours wherewithall The Idle multitude surcharge their laies. Whenas (perhaps) the words thou scornest now May liue, the speaking picture of the minde; The extract of the soule, that laboured, how To leaue the Image of herselfe behinde; Wherein Posteritie, that loue to know The iust proportion of our Spirits, may finde. For these Lines are the veines, the arteries, And vndecaying life-strings of those harts That still shall pant, and still shall exercize The motion, spirit and Nature both imparts; And shall, with those aliue so sympathize, As, nourisht with their powers, inioy their parts. O blessed Letters, that combine in one, All Ages past, and make one liue with all: By you, we doe conferre with who are gone, And, the dead-liuing vnto Councell call: By you, th'vnborne shall haue communion Of what we feele, and what doth vs befall. Soule of the world, Knowledge, without thee, What hath the Earth, that truly glorious is? Why should our pride make such a stirre to be, To be forgot? What good is like to this, To doe worthy the writing, and to write Worthy the reading, and the worlds delight? And let th'vnnaturall and wayward Race, Borne of one wombe with vs, but to our shame, That neuer read t'obserue, but to disgrace; Raise all the tempest of their powre, to blame. That puffe of folly neuer can deface, The worke a happy Genius tooke to frame. Yet why should ciuill Learning seeke to wound And mangle her owne members with despight? Prodigious wits, that study to confound The life of wit, to seeme to know aright, As if themselues had fortunately found Some stand from off the earth beyond our sight; Whence, ouer-looking all as from aboue, Their grace is not to worke, but to reproue. But how came they plac'd in so high degree Aboue the reach and compasse of the rest? Who hath admitted them onely to be Free-denizons of skill, to iudge the best? From whom the world as yet could neuer see The warrant of their wit soundly exprest. T'acquaint our times with that perfection Of high conceipt, which onely they possesse; That we might haue things exquisitely done, Measur'd with all their strict obseruances: Such would (I know) scorne a Translation, Or bring but others labours to the Presse: Yet, oft these monster-breeding mountaines will Bring forth small Mice of great expected skill. Presumption euer fullest of defects, Failes, in the doing, to performe her part: And I haue knowne proude words and poore effects, Of such indeede as doe condemne this Arte: But let them rest, it euer hath beene knowne, They others vertues scorne, that doubt their owne. And for the diuers disagreeing cordes Of inter-iangling Ignorance, that fill The dainty eares, and leaue no roome for words, The worthier mindes neglect, or pardon will: Knowing the best he hath, he frankely foordes, And scornes to be a niggard of his skill. And that the rather, since this short-liu'd race, Being fatally the sonnes but of one day; That now with all their powre plie it apace, To hold out with the greatest might they may, Against Confusion, that hath all in chace, To make of all, an vniuersall pray. For now great Nature hath laid downe at last That mighty birth, wherewith so long she went, And ouer-went the times of ages past, Here to lye in, vpon our soft content: Where fruitfull she, hath multiplyed so fast, That all she hath, on these times seem'd t'haue spent. All that which might haue many ages grac'd, Is borne in one, to make one cloy'd with all; Where Plenty hath imprest a deepe distast, Of best and worst, and all in generall: That Goodnesse seemes Goodnesse to haue defac't, And Vertue hath to Vertue giuen the fall. For Emulation, that proude nurse of Wit, Scorning to stay below or come behinde, Labours vpon that narrow top to sit Of sole Perfection in the highest kinde: Enuy and Wonder looking after it, Thrust likewise, on the selfesame blisse to finde: And so, long striuing, till they can no more, Doe stuffe the place, or others hopes shut out; Who, doubting to ouertake those gone before, Giue vp their care, and cast no more about: And so in scorne, leaue all as fore possest, And will be none, where they may not be best. Eu'n like some empty Creeke, that long hath laine, Left or neglected of the Riuer by, Whose searching sides, pleas'd with a wandring vaine, Finding some little way that close did lie; Steale in at first, then other streames againe Second the first, then more then all supply; Till all the mighty maine hath borne, at last, The glory of his chiefest powre that way; Plying this newfound pleasant roome so fast, Till all be full, and all be at a stay: And then about, and backe againe doth cast, Leauing that full to fall another way: So fares this hum'rous world, that euermore Rapt with the current of a present course, Runnes into that which lay contemn'd before: Then glutted, leaues the same, and falles t'a worse: Now Zeale holdes all, no life but to adore, Then cold in spirit, and faith is of no force. Strait, all that holy was, vnhallowed lies, The scattred carcasses of ruin'd vowes: Then Truth is false, and now hath Blindnesse eies, Then Zeale trusts all, now scarcely what it knowes: That euermore, to foolish or to wise, It fatall is to be seduc'd with showes. Sacred Religion, mother of Forme and Feare, How gorgeously sometimes dost thou sit deckt? What pompous vestures doe we make thee weare? What stately piles we prodigall erect? How sweet perfum'd thou art, how shining cleare? How solemnely obseru'd, with what respect? Another time, all plaine, all quite thread-bare, Thou must haue all within, and nought without; Sit poorely without light, disrob'd,no care Of outward grace, to amuze the poore deuout; Powrelesse, vnfollowed, scarcely men can spare The necessary rites to set thee out. Either Truth, Goodnesse, Vertue are not still The selfesame which they are, and alwayes one, But alter to the proiect of our will, Or we, our actions make them waite vpon, Putting them in the liuery of our skill, And cast them off againe when we haue done. You mightie Lords, that with respected grace Doe at the sterne of faire example stand, And all the body of this populace Guide with the turning of your hand; Keepe a right course, beare vp from all disgrace, Obserue the poynt of glory to our land: Hold vp disgraced knowledge from the ground, Keepe Vertue in request, giue Worth her due, Let not Neglect with barbarous meanes confound So faire a good, to bring in night anew. Be not, O be not accessary found Vnto her death, that must giue life to you. Where will you haue your vertuous name safe laide? In gorgeous Tombes, in sacred Cels secure? Doe you not see those prostate heapes betraide Your fathers bones, and could not keep them sure? And will you trust deceitfull stones faire laide, And thinke they will be to your honour truer? No, no, vnsparing Time will proudly send A warrant vnto Wrath; that with one frowne Will all these mock'ries of Vaine-glory rend, And make them, as before, vngrac'd, vnknowne; Poore idle honours that can ill defend Your memories, that cannot keepe their owne. And whereto serue that wondrous Trophei now, That on the goodly Plaine neere Wilton stands? That huge dumbe heape, that cannot tell vs how, Nor what, nor whence it is, nor with whose hands, Nor for whose glory, it was set to shew How much our pride mocks that of other lands? Whereon, whenas the gazing passenger Hath greedy lookt with admiration, And faine would know his birth, and what he were, How there erected, and how long agone: Enquires, and askes his fellow traueller, What he hath heard, and his opinion: And he knowes nothing. Then he turnes againe, And lookes, and sighs, and then admires afresh, And in himselfe with sorrow doth complaine The misery of darke Forgetfulnesse: Angry with Time that nothing should remaine Our greatest wonders wonder, to expresse. Then Ignorance, with fabulous discourse, Robbing faire Arte and Cunning of their right, Tels, how those stones, were by the Deuils force, From Affrike brought to Ireland in a night, And thence, to Britannie, by Magicke course, From Gyants hands redeem'd, by Merlins sleight. And then neere Ambri plac'd, in memorie Of all those noble Britons murthered there, By Hengist and his Saxon trecherie, Comming to parlee in peace at vnaware. With this old Legend then Credulitie Holdes her content, and closes vp her care: But is Antiquitie so great a liar? Or, doe her yonger sonnes her age abuse, Seeing after-commers still, so apt t'admire The graue authoritie that she doth vse, That reuerence and Respect dares not require Proofe of her deedes, or once her words refuse? Yet wrong they did vs, to presume so far, Vpon our easie credit and delight: For, once found false, they strait became to mar Our faith, and their owne reputation quite, That now her truths hardly beleeued are: And though sh'auouch the right, she scarce hath right. And as for thee, thou huge and mighty frame, That stands corrupted so with times despight, And giu'st false euidence, against their fame That set thee there, to testifie their right; And art become a Traitour to their name That trusted thee with all the best they might. Thou shalt stand still belide, and slaundered, The onely gazing-stocke of Ignorance; And by thy guile, the wise admonished, Shall neuer more desire such heapes t'aduance; Nor trust their liuing glory with the dead That cannot speake, but leaue their fame to Chance: Considering in how small a roome doe lie, And yet lie safe, as fresh as if aliue, All those great worthies of antiquitie; Which long foreliu'd thee, and shall long suruiue; Who stronger tombes found for Eternitie, Then could the powres of all the earth contriue. Where they remaine these trifles to obraid Out of the reach of Spoyle, and way of Rage; Though Time with all his power of yeeres hath laid Long batterie, back'd with vndermining Age, Yet they make head, onely with their owne aide And warre, with his all-conquering forces, wage. Pleading the Heau'ns prescription to be free, And t'haue a grant, t'indure as long as hee. Philocosmus. Beholde how euery man, drawne with delight Of what he doth, flatters him in his way; Striuing to make his course seeme onely right Doth his owne rest, and his owne thoughts betray: Imagination bringing brauely dight, Her pleasing Images in best aray. With flattering glasses that must shew him faire, And others foule: his skill and wit best, Others seduc'd, deceiu'd and wrong in their: His knowledge right, all ignorant the rest. Not seeing how these Minions in the aire Present a face of things falsely exprest, And that the glimmering of these errours showne, Are but a light, to let him see his owne. Alas poore Fame, in what a narrow roome, As an incaged Parrot art thou pent Here amongst vs, where, euen as good be dombe As speake, and to be heard with no attent? How can you promise of the time to come, Whenas the present are so negligent? Is this the walke of all your wide renowne, This litle Point, this scarce discerned Ile, Thrust from the world, with whom our speech vnknowne Made neuer any traffike of our Stile? And in this All, where all this care is showne, T'inchant your fame to last so long a while? And for that happier tongues haue wonne so much, Thinke you to make your barbarous language such? Poore narrow limits for so mightie paines, That cannot promise any forraine vent: And yet, if here, to all, your wondrous vaines Were generally knowne, it might content: But loe, how many reades not, or disdaines The labour of the chiefe and excellent? How many thousands neuer heard the name Of Sidney, or of Spencer, or their Bookes? And yet braue fellowes, and presume of Fame, And seeme to beare downe all the world with lookes? What then shall they expect of meaner frame, On whose indeuours few or none scarce lookes? Doe you not see these Pamphlets, Libels and Rymes, These strange confused tumults of the minde, Are growne to be the sicknesse of these times, The great disease inflicted on mankinde? Your Vertues by your Follies made your crimes, Haue issue with your indiscretion ioyn'd. Schooles, Artes, Professions, all in so great store, Passe the proportion of the present state; Where, being as great a number as before, And fewer roomes them to accommodate: It cannot be but they must throng the more, And kick, and thrust, and shoulder with Debate. For when the greater wits cannot attaine Th'expected good, which they account their right, And yet perceiue others to reape that gaine Of farre inferiour vertues in their sight: They present, with the sharpe of Enuie, straine To wound them with reproches and despight: And for these cannot haue as well as they, They scorne their faith should deigne to looke that way. Hence, discontented Sects and Schismes arise, Hence interwounding Controuersies spring, That feede the Simple, and offend the Wise, Who know the consequence of cauelling Disgrace, that these to others doe deuise: Contempt and Scorne on all in th'end doth bring, Like scolding wiues, reckning each others fault, Make standers-by imagine both are naught. For when to these rare dainties, time admits All commers, all complexions, all that will, Where none should be let in but choisest wits, Whose milde discretion could comport with skill: For when the place their humour neither fits, Nor they the place, who can expect but ill? For being vnapt for what they tooke in hand, And for aught els whereto they shall b'addrest, They eu'n become th'incumbrance of the land, As out of ranke, disordring all the rest: This grace of theirs, to seeme to vnderstand, Marres all their grace, to doe, without their rest. Men finde, that action is another thing, Then what they in discoursing papers reade: The worlds affaires require in managing, More Artes then those wherein you Clerkes proceede: Whilst timorous Knowledge stands considering, Audacious Ignorance hath done the deede; For who knowes most, the more he knowes to doubt; The least discourse is commonly most stout; This sweet inchaunting Knowledge turnes you cleene Out from the fields of naturall delight, And makes you hide, vnwilling to be seene In th'open concourse of a publike sight: This skill, wherewith you haue so cunning beene, Vnsinues all your powres, vnmans you quite. Publike societie and commerce of men Require another grace, another port: This Eloquence, these Rymes, these Phrases then, Begot in shades, doe serue vs in no sort; Th'vnmateriall swelling of your Pen Touch not the spirit that action doth import: A manly stile, fitted to manly eares Best grees with wit; not that which goes so gay, And commonly the gawdy liu'ry weares Of nice Corruptions, which the times doe sway, And waites on th'humour of his pulse that beares His passions set to such a pleasing kay: Such dainties serue onely for stomackes weake; For men doe fowlest, when they finest speake. Yet doe I not dislike that in some wise Be sung, the great heroicall deserts, Of braue renowned spirits; whose exercise Of worthy deeds may call vp others hearts, And serue a modell for posterities, To fashion them fit for like glorious parts: But so, that all our spirits may tend hereto, To make it, not our grace, to say, but do. Musophilus. Mvch thou hast said, and willingly I heare, As one that am not so possest with Loue Of what I doe, but that I rather beare An eare to learne, then a tongue to disproue: I know men must, as carried in their spheare, According to their proper motions, moue. And that course likes them best which they are on, Yet Truth hath certaine bounds, but Falshood none. I doe confesse our limits are but small, Compar'd with all the whole vaste earth beside; All which, againe, rated to that great All, Is likewise as a poynt, scarcely descride: So that in these respects, we may this call, A poynt but of a poynt, where we abide. But if we shall descend from that high stand Of ouer-looking Contemplation, And cast our thoughts, but to, and not beyond This spacious circuit which we tread vpon; We then may estimate our mighty land, A world, within a world standing alone. Where, if our fame confind cannot get out, What, shall we imagine it is pen'd, That hath so great a world to walke about, Whose bounds with her reports haue both one end? Why shall we not rather esteeme her stout, That farther then her owne scorne to extend? Where being so large a roome, both to doe well, And eke to heare th'applause of things well done, That farther, if men shall our vertues tell, We haue more mouthes, but not more merit won; It doth not greater make that which is laudable, The flame is bigger blowne, the fire all one. And for the few that onely lend their eare, That few, is all the world; which with a few Doe euer liue, and moue, and worke, and stirre. This is the heart doth feele and onely know The rest of all, that onely bodies beare, Rowle vp and downe, and fill vp but the row. And serues as others members, not their owne, The instruments of those that doe direct. Then what disgrace is this, not to be knowne To those know not to giue themselues respect? And though they swell with pompe of folly blowne, They liue vngrac'd, and die but in Neglect. And for my part, if onely one allow The care my labouring spirits take in this, He is to me a Theater large enow, And his applause onely sufficient is: All my respect is bent but to his brow, That is my All; and all I am, is his. And if some worthy spirits be pleased too, It shall more comfort breede, but not more will. But what if none? It cannot yet vndoo The loue I beare vnto this holy skill: This is the thing that I was borne to doo, This is my Scene, this part must I fulfill. Let those that know not breath, esteeme of winde, And set t'a vulgar ayre their seruile song; Rating their goodnesse by the praise they find, Making their worth on others fits belong; As Vertue were the hireling of the minde, And could not liue if Fame had ne'r a tong. Hath that all-knowing powre that holdes within The goodly prospectiue of all this frame, (Where, whatsoeuer is, or what hath bin, Reflects a certaine image of the same) No inward pleasures to delight her in, But she must gad to seeke an almes of Fame? Must she, like to a wanton Curtezan, Open her brests for shew, to winne her praise; And blaze her faire bright beauty vnto man As if she were enamour'd of his wayes, And knew not Weakenesse, nor could rightly scan To what defects his hum'rous breath obayes? She that can tell, how proud Ambition Is but a Beggar, and hath nought at all, But what is giu'n of meere Deuotion: For which, how much it sweats, how much it's thrall? What toyle it takes, and yet, when all is done, Th'endes in expectation neuer fall; Shall she ioyne hands with such a seruile mate, And prostrate her faire body, to commit Folly with earth, and to defile that state Of cleerenesse, for so grosse a benefit? Hauing Reward dwelling within her gate, And Glory of her owne to furnish it: Her selfe, a recompence sufficient Vnto her selfe, to giue her owne content. I'st not enough, that she hath rais'd so hie, Those that be hers, that they may sit and see The earth below them, and this All to lie Vnder their view, taking the true degree Of the iust height of swolne Mortalitie, Right as it is, not as it seemes to be? And vndeceiued with the Paralax Of a mistaking eye of passion, know By these mask'd outsides what the inward lackes; Meas'ring man by himselfe, not by his show; Wondering not at their rich and golden backes, That haue poore mindes and little else to shew: Nor taking that for them which well they see Is not of them, but rather is their loade: The lies of Fortune, wherewithall men be Deemed within, when they be all abroade: Whose ground, whose grasse, whose earth haue cap and knee, Which they suppose, is on themselues bestow'd. And thinke like Isis Asse, all Honours are Giuen vnto them alone, the which are done Vnto the painted Idoll which they beare, That onely makes them to be gazed on: For take away their packe, and shew them bare, And see what best this Honour rides vpon. Hath Knowledge lent to hers the priuy kay, To let them in vnto the highest Stage Of Causes, Secrets, Counsels, to suruay The wits of men, their hearts, their colds, their rage, That build, destroy, praise, hate, say and gainesay, Beleeue and vnbeleeue, all in one age. And shall we trust goodnesse as it proceedes From that vnconstant mouth, which with one breath Will make it bad againe vnlesse it feedes The present humour that it fauoureth? Shall we esteeme and reckon how it heedes Our workes, that his owne vowes vnhalloweth? Then whereto serues it to haue bin inlarg'd With this free manumission of the mind, If for all that, we still continue charg'd With those discou'red errors which we finde? As if our knowledge onely were discharg'd, Yet we our selues staid in a seruile kinde. That Vertue must be out of countenance, If this grosse spirit, or that weake shallow braine, Or this nice wit, or that distemperance, Neglect, distaste, vncomprehend, disdaine; When such sicke eyes can neuer cast a glance, But through the colours of their proper staine. Though, I must needes confesse, the small respect, That these great-seeming best of men doe giue, (Whose brow begets th'inferior sorts neglect,) Might moue the weake irresolute to grieue: But stronger, see how iustly this defect Hath ouertooke the times wherein we liue: That Learning needs must runne the common fate Of all things else, thrust on by her owne weight, Comporting not her selfe in her estate Vnder this burthen of a selfe conceit: Our owne dissentious hands opening the gate Vnto Contempt, that on our quarrels waite, Discou'red haue our inward gouernement, And let in hard opinion to Disgrace The generall, for some weake impotent That beare out their disease with a stolne face; Who (silly soules) the more wit they haue spent, The lesse they shew'd, not bettring their bad case. And see how soone this rowling world can take Aduantage for her dissolution, Faine to get loose from this withholding stake Of ciuill Science and Discretion: How glad it would runne wilde, that it might make One formelesse forme of one confusion? Like tyrant Ottomans blindefolded state, Which must know nothing more, but to obay: For this, seekes greedy Ignorance t'abate Our number, order, liuing, forme and sway: For this, it practises to dissipate Th'vnsheltred troupes, till all be made away. For, since our Fathers sinnes pull'd first to ground The pale of their disseuered dignitie, And ouerthrew that holy reuerent bound That parted learning and the Laiety, And laid all flat in common, to confound The honour and respect of Pietie: It did so much invile the estimate Of th'opened and inuulgar'd mysteries, Which now reduc'd vnto the basest rate, Must waite vpon the Norman subtilties, Who (being mounted vp into their state) Doe best with wrangling rudenesse sympathize. And yet, though now set quite behinde the traine Of vulgar sway (and light of powre weigh'd light) Yet would this giddy innouation faine Downe with it lower, to abase it quite: And those poore remnants that doe yet remaine The spoyled markes of their diuided right: They wholly would deface to leaue no face Of reuerent Distinction and Degree, As if they weigh'd no diffrence in this case, Betwixt Religions Age and Infancie: Where th'one must creepe, th'other stand with grace, Lest turn'd to a child it ouerturned be. Though to pull backe th'on-running state of things, (Gath'ring corruption, as it gathers dayes) Vnto the forme of their first orderings, Is the best meanes that dissolution stayes, And to goe forward, backward, right, men brings, T'obserue the line from whence they tooke their wayes. Yet being once gone wide, and the right way Not leuell to the times condition: To alter course, may bring men more astray, And leauing what was knowne to light on none; Since eu'ry change the reuerence doth decay, Of that which alway should continue one. For this is that close kept Palladium Which once remoou'd, brings ruine euermore: This stir'd, makes men fore-setled, to become Curious, to know what was beleeu'd before: Whilst Faith disputes that vsed to be dombe, And more men striue to talke, then to adore. For neuer head-strong Reformation will Rest, till to th'extreame opposite it runne, And ouer-runne the meane distrusted still, As being too neare of kinne, to that men shunne: For good, and bad, and all, must be one ill, When once there is another truth begunne. So hard it is an euen hand to beare, In tamp'ring with such maladies as these; Lest that our forward passions launce too neare, And make the cure proue worse then the disease: For with the worst we will not spare the best, Because it growes with that, which doth displease: And faults are easier lookt in, then redrest: Men running with such eager violence, At the first view of errours fresh in quest; As they, to rid an inconuenience, Sticke not to raise a mischiefe in the steed, Which after mocks their weake improuidence: And therefore doe make not your owne sides bleed To pricke at others: you that would amend By pulling downe, and thinke you can proceed, By going backe vnto the farther end, Let stand that little Couert left behinde, Whereon your succours and respects depend. And bring not downe the prizes of the minde, With vnder-rating of your selues so base: You that the mighties doores doe crooching find, To sell your selues to buy a little grace, Or waite whole months to out-bid Symonie, For that, which being got, is not your place: For if it were, what needed you to buy What was your due; your thirsting shewes your shift, And little worth that seekes iniuriously A worthier from his lawfull roome to lift? We cannot say, that you were then prefer'd, But that your money was, or some worse gift. O scattring gath'rers, that without regard Of times to come, will to be made, vndo As if you were the last of men, prepar'd To bury in your graues all other to. Dare you prophane that holy portion Which neuer sacrilegious hand durst do? Did forme-establishing Deuotion, To maintaine a respectiue reuerence Extend her bountifull prouision, With such a charitable prouidence, For your deforming hands to dissipate, And make Gods due, your impious expence? No maruell then, though th'ouerpestred State Want roome for goodnesse, if our little hold Be lesned vnto such a narrow rate, That Reuerence cannot sit, fit as it should: And yet what neede we thus for roomes complaine, That shall not want voyde roomes if this course hold? And more then will be fill'd; for who will straine To get an empty title, to betray His hopes, and trauell for an honour vaine, And gaine a Port, without support or stay? What neede hath Enuy to maligne their state, That will themselues, so kind, giue it away? This makes indeede our number passe the rate Of our prouisions: which, if dealt aright, Would yeeld sufficient roome t'accommodate, More then we haue in places requisite. The ill disposing onely doth vs set In disaray, and out of order quite. Whiles other guifts then of the minde shall get Vnder our colours, that which is our dues, And to our trauels, neither benefit, Nor grace, nor honour, nor respect accrewes: The sicknesse of the States soule, Learning, then The bodies great distemprature insues. For if that Learnings roomes to learned men Were as their heretage distributed, All this disordred thrust would cease: for when The fit were call'd, th'vnworthy frustrated, These would b'asham'd to seeke, those to b'vnsought, And stay'ng their turne, were sure they should be sped. Then would our drooping Academies, brought Againe in heart, regaine that reuerend hand Of lost Opinion, and no more be thought, Th'vnnecessary furnish of the land, Nor discourag'd with their small esteeme, Confus'd, irresolute and wauering stand: Caring not to become profound, but seeme Contented with a superficiall skill; Which for a sleight reward enough they deeme, When th'one succeedes as well as th'other will: Seeing shorter wayes leade sooner to their end, And others longer trauels thriue so ill. Then would they onely labour to extend Their now vnsearching spirit beyond these bounds Of others powres; wherein they must be pend, As if there were besides, no other grounds: And set their bolde Plus vltra farre without The pillers of those Axioms Age propounds: Discou'ring daily more and more about, In that immense and boundlesse Ocean Of Natures riches; neuer yet found out, Nor fore-clos'd, with the wit of any man. So farre beyond the ordinary course That other vnindustrious Ages ran, That these more curious times, they might diuorce From the opinion they are linckt vnto Of our disable and vnactiue force, To shew true knowledge can both speake and do: Arm'd for the sharpe, which in these dayes they finde, With all prouisions that belong thereto: That their Experience may not come behinde The times conceipt, but leading in their place, May make men see the weapons of the minde Are States best strengths, and kingdomes chiefest grace; And roomes of charge, charg'd full with worth and praise, Makes Maiestie appeare with her full face, Shining with all her beames, with all her raies, Vnscanted of her parts, vnshadowed In any darkened poynt; which still bewrayes The wane of Powre, when powr's vnfurnished, And hath not all those intire complements Wherewith the State should for her state be sped. And though the fortune of some age consents Vnto a thousand errours grossely wrought, Which flourisht ouer with their faire euents, Haue past for currant, and good courses thought: The least whereof, in other times againe Most dang'rous inconueniences haue brought, Whilst to the times, not to mens wits pertaine, The good successes of ill manag'd deedes: Though th'ignorant deceiued with colours vaine, Misse of the causes whence this lucke proceedes. Forraine defects giuing home-faults the way, Make eu'n that weakenesse sometimes well succeedes. I grant, that some vnlettred practique may (Leauing beyond the Alpes, Faith and Respect To God and man) with impious cunning, sway The courses fore-begunne with like effect, And without stop, maintaine the turning on, And haue his errours deem'd without defect: But when some powerfull opposition, Shall, with a sound incountring shocke, disioynt The fore-contriued frame, and thereupon, Th'experience of the present disappoynt, And other stirring spirits, and other hearts Built-huge, for action, meeting in a poynt: Shall driue the world to sommon all their Artes, And all too little for so reall might, When no aduantages of weaker parts Shall beare out shallow councels from the light: And this sence-opening action (which doth hate Vnmanly craft) shall looke to haue her right. Who then holdes vp the glory of the State (Which letred armes, and armed letters won) Who shall be fittest to negotiate, Contemn'd Iustinian, or else Littleton? When it shall not be held wisedome to be Priuately made, and publikely vndone: But sound designes that iudgement shall decree Out of a true discerne, of the cleere wayes That lie direct, with safe-going Equitie; Imbroyling not their owne and others dayes. Extending forth their prouidence, beyond The circuit of their owne particular: That eu'n the ignorant may vnderstand, How that deceit is but a cauillar; And true vnto it selfe can neuer stand, But still must with her owne conclusions warre. Can Truth and Honestie, wherein consists The right, repose on earth? the surest ground Of Trust, come weaker arm'd into the lists, Then Fraud or Vice, that doth it selfe confound? Or shall Presumption that doth what it lists, Not what it ought, carry her courses sound? Then, what safe place out of confusion Hath plaine proceeding Honestie to dwell? What sute of grace hath Vertue to put on, If Vice shall weare as good, and doe as well? If Wrong, if Craft, if Indiscretion, Act as faire parts, with ends as laudable? Which all this mighty volume of euents, The world, the vniuersall map of deedes Strongly controwles, and proues from all discents, That the directest courses best succeedes When Craft, wrapt still in many comberments With all her cunning thriues not, though it speedes. For, should not graue and learn'd Experience That lookes with th'eyes of all the world beside, And with all ages holdes intelligence, Goe safer then Deceit without a guide? Which in the by-paths of her diffidence Crossing the waies of Right, still runs more wide: Who will not grant? and therefore this obserue, No state stands sure, but on the grounds of Right, Of Vertue, Knowledge, Iudgement to preserue, And all the powres of Learning requisite: Though other shifts a present turne may serue, Yet in the tryall they will weigh too light. And doe not thou contemne this swelling tide And streame of words, that now doth rise so hie Aboue the vsuall bankes, and spreads so wide Ouer the borders of Antiquitie: Which I confesse comes euer amplifide With th'abounding humours that doe multiplie: And is with that same hand of happinesse Inlarg'd, as vices are out of their bands: Yet so, as if let out but to redresse, And calme, and sway th'affections it commands: Which as it stirres, it doth againe represse And brings in, th'out-gone malice that withstands. Powre aboue powres, O heauenly Eloquence, That with the strong reine of commanding words, Dost manage, guide, and master th'eminence Of mens affections, more then all their swords: Shall we not offer to thy Excellence, The richest treasure that our wit affords? Thou that canst doe much more with one poore pen Then all the powres of Princes can effect: And draw, diuert, dispose and fashion men Better then force or rigour can direct: Should we this ornament of Glory then As th'vnmateriall fruits of shades, neglect? Or should we carelesse, come behinde the rest In powre of words, that goe before in worth, Whenas our accents equall to the best, Is able greater wonders to bring forth: When all that euer hotter spirits exprest, Comes bettred by the patience of the North. And who, in time, knowes whither we may vent The treasure of our tongue, to what strange shores This gaine of our best glory shall be sent, T'inrich vnknowing Nations with our stores? What worlds in th'yet vnformed Occident May come refin'd with th'accents that are ours? Or, who can tell for what great worke in hand The greatnesse of our stile is now ordain'd? What powrs it shall bring in, what spirits command, What thoughts let out, what humours keepe restrain'd, What mischiefe it may powrefully withstand, And what faire ends may thereby be attain'd. And as for Poesie (mother of this force) That breedes, brings forth, and nourishes this might, Teaching it in a loose, yet measured course, With comely motions how to goe vpright: And fostring it with bountifull discourse, Adornes it thus in fashions of delight, What should I say? since it is well approu'd The speech of heauen, with whom they haue commerce; That onely seeme out of themselues remou'd, And doe with more then humane skills conuerse: Those numbers wherewith heau'n and earth are mou'd, Shew, weakenesse speakes in Prose, but powre in Verse. Wherein thou likewise seemest to allow, That th'acts of worthy men should be preseru'd: As in the holiest Tombes we can bestow Vpon their glory that haue well deseru'd, Wherein thou dost no other Vertue show, Then what most barbrous Countries haue obseru'd: When all the happiest Nations hitherto Did with no lesser glory speake, then do. Now to what else thy malice shall obiect, For Schooles, and Artes, and their necessitie: When from my Lord, whose iudgement must direct, And forme, and fashion my abilitie, I shall haue got more strength; thou shalt expect Out of my better leasure, my reply. FINIS. IX. OCCASIONAL POEMS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. 1593–1607. An Ode. Now each creature ioyes the other, passing happy dayes and howers; One Bird reports vnto another, in the fall of siluer showers; Whilst the earth (our common mother) hath her bosome deckt with flowers. Whilst the greatest Torch of heauen, with bright rayes warmes Floras lap, Making nights and dayes both euen, chearing plants with fresher sap: My field of flowers quite bereuen, wants refresh of better hap. Eccho, daughter of the Aire, (babling guest of Rocks and hils,) Knows the name of my fierce Faire, and sounds the accents of my ils. Each thing pitties my dispaire, whilst that she her Louer kils. Whilst that she (O cruell Mayd) doth me and my true loue despise; My liues florish is decayed, that depended on her eyes: But her will must be obeyed, and well he ends for loue who dies. A Pastorall. O happy golden Age, Not for that Riuers ranne With streames of milke, and hunny dropt from trees; Not that the earth did gage Vnto the husband-man Her voluntary fruites, free without fees: Not for no cold did freeze, Nor any cloud beguile, Th'eternall flowring Spring Wherein liu'd euery thing, And whereon th'heauens perpetually did smile; Not for no ship had brought From forraine shores, or warres or wares ill sought. But onely for that name, That Idle name of wind: That Idoll of deceit, that empty sound Call'd Honor, which became The tyran of the minde, And so torments our Nature without ground; Was not yet vainly found: Nor yet sad griefes imparts Amidst the sweet delights Of ioyfull amorous wights. Nor were his hard lawes knowne to free-borne hearts. But golden lawes like these Which nature wrote. That's lawfull which doth please. Then amongst flowres and springs Making delightfull sport, Sate Louers without conflict, without flame; And Nymphs and shepheards sings, Mixing in wanton sort Whisp'rings with Songs, then kisses with the same Which from affection came: The naked virgin then Her Roses fresh reueales, Which now her vaile conceales: The tender Apples in her bosome seene. And oft in Riuers cleere The Louers with their Loues consorting were. Honor, thou first didst close The spring of all delight: Denying water to the amorous thirst Thou taught'st faire eyes to lose The glory of their light; Restrain'd from men, and on themselues reuerst. Thou in a lawne didst first Those golden haires incase, Late spred vnto the wind; Thou mad'st loose grace vnkind, Gau'st bridle to their words, art to their pace. O Honour it is thou That mak'st that stealth, which loue doth free allow. It is thy worke that brings Our griefes, and torments thus: But thou fierce Lord of Nature and of Loue, The quallifier of Kings, What doest thou here with vs That are below thy power, shut from aboue? Goe and from vs remoue, Trouble the mighties sleepe, Let vs neglected, base, Liue still without thy grace, And th'vse of th'ancient happy ages keepe: Let's loue: this life of ours Can make no truce with time that all deuours. Let's loue: the sun doth set, and rise againe, But whenas our short light Comes once to set, it makes eternall night. A Description of Beauty, translated out of Marino. 1 O beauty (beames, nay flame Of that great lampe of light) That shines a while, with fame, But presently makes night: Like Winters short-liu'd bright, Or Summers suddaine gleames, How much more deare, so much losse-lasting beames. 2 Wing'd Loue away doth flye, And with it time doth beare; And both take suddainly The sweate, the faine, the deare: A shining day, and cleare, Succeedes an obscene night, And sorrow is the hewe of sweet delight. 3 With what then dost thou swell, O youth of new-borne day? Wherein doth thy pride dwell O beauty made of clay? Not with to swift away The headlong corrant flyes, As do the sparkling rayes of two faire eyes. 4 Do not thy selfe betray VVith wantonizing yeares: O beauty, traytors gay, Thy melting life that weares, Appearing, disappeares, And with thy flying dayes, Ends all thy good of price, thy faire of prayse. 5 Trust not, vaine creditor Thy apt deceiued view, In thy false counsellor, That neuer tels thee true: Thy forme, and flattred hew, Which shall so soone transpasse, Is farre more faire, then is thy looking-glasse. 6 Inioy thy Aprill now, Whilst it doth freely shine; This lightning flash and show, With that cleare spirit of thine, Will suddainly decline; And thou faire murthering eyes Shalbe loues tombes, where now his cradle lyes. 7 Old trembling age will come, With wrinkled cheekes, and staines, With motion troublesome, With skinne and bloodlesse veines, That liuely visage reauen, And made deform'd and old, Hates sight of glasse, it lou'd so to behold. 8 Thy gold, and scarlet shall Pale siluer colour bee, Thy rowe of pearles shall fall Like withred leaues from tree; And thou shalt shortly see Thy face and haire to grow All plough'd with furrowes, ouer-sowne with snow. 9 That which on Flora's brest, All fresh and flourishing, Aurora newly drest, Saw in her dawning spring; Quite dry and languishing Depriu'd of honour quite, Day-closing Hesperus beholds at night. 10 Faire is the Lilly, faire The Rose, of flowers the eye; Both wither in the ayre, Their beautious colours die; And so at length shall lye Depriu'd of former grace, The lillies of thy brests, the roses of thy face. 11 What then wilt it auaile, O youth aduised ill, In lap of beauty fraile To nurse a way-ward will; Like snake in sunne-warme hill? Plucke, plucke, betime thy flower, That springs, and parcheth in one short howre. To the Angell Spirit of the most excellent, S?. Phillip Sidney. To the pure Spirit, to thee alone addrest Is this ioynt worke, by double intrist thine; Thine by his owne, and what is done of mine Inspir'd by thee, thy secret powre imprest. My Muse with thine, it selfe dar'd to combine As mortall staffe with that which is diuine: Let thy faire beames giue luster to the rest. That Israels King may daygne his owne transform'd In substance no, but superficiall tire: And English guis'd in some sort may aspire To better grace thee what the vulgar form'd: His sacred Tones, age after age admire. Nations grow great in pride, and pure desire So to excell in holy rites perform'd. O had that soule which honour brought to rest To soone not leaft, and reaft the world of all What man could shew, which we perfection call; This precious peece had sorted with the best. But ah! wide festred wounds that neuer shall Nor must be clos'd, vnto fresh bleeding fall: Ah memory, what needs this new arrist. Yet blessed griefe, that sweetnes can impart Since thou art blest. Wrongly do I complaine; What euer weights my heauy thoughts sustaine Deere feeles my soule for thee. I know my part, Nor be my weaknes to thy rites a staine; Rites to aright, life bloud would not refraine: Assist me then, that life what thine did part. Time may bring forth, what time hath yet supprest, In whom, thy losse hath layd to vtter wast The wracke of time, vntimely all defac't, Remayning as the tombe of life disceast: VVhere, in my heart the highest roome thou hast; There, truly there, thy earthly being is plac't: Triumph of death, in life how more then blest. Behold! O that thou were now to behold, This finisht long perfections part begun; The rest but peic'd, as leaft by thee vndone; Pardon blest soule, presumption ouerbold: If loue and zeale hath to this error run Tis zealous loue, loue that hath neuer dun, Nor can enough, though iustly here contrould. But since it hath no other scope to go, Nor other purpose but to honour thee, That thine may shine, where all the graces be; And that my thoughts (like smallest streames that flow, Pay to their sea, their tributary fee) Do striue, yet haue no meanes to quit nor free, That mighty debt of infinits I owe. To thy great worth which time to times inroule VVonder of men, sole borne, soule of thy kind Compleat in all, but heauenly was thy mind, For wisdome, goodnes, sweetnes, fairest soule: To good to wish, to faire for earth, refin'd For Heauen, where all true glory rests confin'd: And where but there no life without controule. O when from this accompt, this cast-vp somme, This reckning made the Audit of my woe, Some time of rase my swelling passions know, How work my thoughts, my sense, is striken dombe That would the more then words could euer shew; Which all fall short. Who knew thee best do know There liues no wit that may thy prayer become. And rest faire monuments of thy faire fame, Though not complete. Nor can we reach, in thought, What on that goodly peece, time would haue wrought. Had diuers so spar'd that life (but life) to frame The rest: alas such losse the world hath nought Can equall it, nor O more grieuance brought, Yet what remaines must euer crowne thy name. Receiue these Hims, these obsequies receiue, (If any marke of thy secret spirit thou beare) Made only thine, and no name els must weare. I can no more deare soule, I take my leaue, My sorrow striues to mount the highest Sphere. Vlisses and the Syren. Syren. Come worthy Greeke, Vlisses come Possesse these shores with me: The windes and Seas are troublesome, And heere we may be free. Here may we sit, and view their toile That trauaile on the deepe, And ioy the day in mirth the while, And spend the night in sleepe. Vlis. Faire Nimph, if fame, or honor were To be atteynd with ease, Then would I come and rest with thee, And leaue such toyles as these. But here it dwels, and here must I With danger seeke it forth: To spend the time luxuriously Becomes not men of worth. Syr. Vlisses, O be not deceiu'd With that vnreall name: This honour is a thing conceiu'd, And rests on others fame. Begotten onely to molest Our peace, and to beguile (The best thing of our life) our rest, And giue vs vp to toile. Vlis. Delicious Nimph, suppose there were Nor honour, nor report, Yet manlines would scorne to weare The time in idle sport. For toyle doth giue a better touch, To make vs feele our ioy: And ease finds tediousnesse as much As labour yeelds annoy. Syr. Then pleasure likewise seemes the shore Whereto tends all your toyle, Which you forgo to make it more, And perish oft the while. Who may disporte them diuersly, Finde neuer tedious day, And ease may haue varietie, As well as action may. Vlis. But natures of the noblest frame, These toyles, and dangers please, And they take comfort in the same, As much as you in ease. And with the thoughts of actions past Are . . . . reuealed still; When pleasure leaues a touch at last, To shew that it was ill. Syr. That doth opinion onely cause, That's out of custome bred, Which makes vs many other lawes Then euer Nature did. No widdowes waile for our delights, Our sportes are without bloud, The world we see by warlike wights, Receiues more hurt then goud. Vlis. But yet the state of things require These motions of vnrest, And these great Sports of high desire, Seeme borne to turne them best. To purge the mischiefes that increase And all good order mar: For oft we see a wicked peace, To be well chang'd for war. Syr. Well, well Vlisses then I see I shall not haue thee heare, And therefore I will come to thee, And take my fortunes there. I must be wonne that cannot win, Yet lost were I not wonne: For beauty hath created bin, T'vndoo, or be vndonne. “To Edward Seymour Earle of Hertford: Concerning his question of a distressed man in a Boate vpon the Seas. “The passion of a distressed man, who being in a tempest on the Sea, and hauing in his Boate two Women, of whom, he loued the one that disdained him, and scorned the other who affected him, was by commandement from Neptune, to cast out one of them, to appease the rage of the tempest, but which, was referred to his owne choice.” My vnkinde Loue, or she that loues me deare, Neptune will haue cast forth to calme the Seas. One of these two, or all must perish here: And therefore now, which shall I saue of these? Ah! doe I make a question which to saue, When my desires share but one onely part! Who should it be but she to whom I haue Resign'd my life, and sacrific'd my hart? She, she must liue, the tempests of whose brow Confound me more then all these stormes can doo, And but for whom I liue: And therefore how Can any life be life, lesse she liue too? For by that meanes I both may pacifie The rigour of these waues, and her hard heart, Who must saue him who would not let her die: Nor can she but reward so great desert. She cannot, but in mercy needes must giue Comfort to him, by whom her selfe doth liue. Pars altera. Bvt shall the bloud of her that loues me then Be sacrifiz'd to her disdainefulnesse That scornes my loue? and shall I hope to win Mercie from her, by being mercilesse? Will not her safety being thus attain'd, Raise her proude heart t'a higher set of scorne, When she shall see my passions are distain'd With bloud, although it were to serue her turne? Since th'act of ill, though it fall good to vs, Makes vs yet hate the doer of the same: And though my hand should haue preseru'd her thus, Yet being by cruell meanes, it is my shame; Which she will but ascribe to my defects, And th'imperfections of my passions; which She knowes the influence of her eyes effects, And therein ioyes t'haue vanquisht me so much. And when desert shall seeme t'exact reward, It breedes a loathing in the heart of Grace; That must worke free out of her owne regard, And haue no dues t'obraid her to her face. So shall I then haue bent against my soule Both her disdaine, and th'horror of that deed; Which euer must my crueltie controule, And checke the wrong that neuer can succeed. And though it be requir'd that one must go, By message sent me from the powrs Diuine, Yet will I not redeeme my safety so; Though life be in their hand, death is in mine. And therefore since compassion cannot be Cruell to either, Neptune take all three. Resumptio. Bvt that were to be cruell to all three, Rebell to Nature, and the gods arrest, Whose ordinances must obserued be; Nor may our frailty with the heauens contest. Why then that must be done that's least vniust, And my affections may not beare a part With crueltie and wrong. But here I must Be of a side, to goe against my hart, And her disdaine her due reward must haue: She must be cast away that would not saue. S. D. Of William Jones, his “Nennio 1595.” Here dost thou bring (my friend) a stranger borne To be indenized with vs, and made our owne, Nobilitie; whose name indeed is worne By manie that are great, or mightie growne: But yet to him most natural, best knowne, To whom thou doost thy labours sacrifize, And in whom al those vertues best are showne Which here this little volume doth comprize. Wheron when he shall cast his worthie eies, He here shal glasse himselfe, himselfe shal reed: The modell of his owne perfections lies Here plaine describ'd, which he presents indeed: So that if men can not true worth discerne By this discourse, looke they on him and learne. Sa. Danyel. From “Penelopes Complaint: Or, A Mirrour for wanton Minions. To his most dear friend P. C.—S. D. Why seeks she titles, boasts she riches, why—Avisa? Is she with thy Penelope to vie? The one renowned, revered, true to her own: Avisa An unknown woman from a place unknown. The one spouse of a prince of glorious name: Avisa Child of an innkeeper, wife of the same. The one is chaste, her husband being away: Avisa Chaste when he is at home, by night and day. The one through twice ten years strong to endure: Avisa Through scarce as many days could be kept pure. The one to a hundred lords refused her hand: Avisa The force and prayers of seven could scarce withstand. The one would spin until her task was done: Avisa Ne'er tired the spinning-wheel with what she spun. The one to the Greeks and Romans praise: Avisa Has but one man her name and fame to raise. Long live Penelope and flourish fair: Avisa May never with Penelope compare. From “Il Pastor Fido; or The Faithfull Shepheard.” Translated out of Italian into English. 1602. To the right worthy and learned Knight, . . . . Syr Edward Dymock, Champion to her Maiestie, concerning this translation of Pastor Fido. I do reioyce learned and worthy Knight, That by the hand of thy kinde Country-man (This painfull and industrious Gentleman) Thy deare esteem'd Guarini comes to light: Who in thy loue I know tooke great delight As thou in his, who now in England can Speake as good English as Italian, And here enioyes the grace of his owne right. Though I remember he hath oft imbas'd Vnto us both the vertues of the North, Saying, our costes were with no measures grac'd, Nor barbarous tongues could any verse bring forth. I would he sawe his owne, or knew our store, Whose spirits can yeeld as much, and if not more. Sam. Daniell. From “BARTAS his Deuine Weekes &amp; Workes.” Translated by Iosuah Syluester, 1605. To my good friend, M. Syluester, in honour of this sacred Worke. Thus to aduenture forth, and re-conuay The best of treasures, from a Forraine Coast, And take that wealth wherin they gloried most, And make it Ours by such a gallant pray, And that without in-iustice; doth bewray The glory of the Worke, that we may boast Much to haue wonne, and others nothing lost By taking such a famous prize away. As thou industrious Sylvester hast wrought, And heere enritch'd vs with th'immortall store Of others sacred lines: which from them brought Comes by thy taking greater then before: So hast thou lighted from a flame deuout, As great a flame, that neuer shall goe out. Samuel Daniel. From Clement Edmundes (Remembrancer of the Cittie of London): his “Obseruations vpon Cæsars Comentaries, 1609.” To my friend, Maister Clement Edmonds. Who thus extracts, with more then Chymique Art, The spirit of Bookes, shewes the true way to finde Th'Elixer that our leaden Parts conuart Into the golden Metall of the Minde. Who thus obserues in such materiall kinde The certaine Motions of hie Practises, Knowes on what Center th'Actions of Mankinde Turne in their course, and sees their fatalnes. And hee that can make these obseruances, Must be aboue his Booke, more then his Pen. For, wee may be assur'd, hee men can ghesse, That thus doth Cæsar knowe; the Man of men. Whose Work, improu'd here to our greater gaine, Makes Cæsar more then Cæsar to containe. Sam. Danyell. From “Queen Anna's New World of Words,” etc. Collected by John Florio. 1611. To my deare friend and brother M. Iohn Florio, one of the Gentlemen of hir Maiesties Royall Priuy-chamber. I stand not to giue praise before the face Of this great worke, that doth it selfe commend: But to congratulate the good and grace That England com's thereby to apprehend: And in hir name to thanke your industry Laborius Flório, who haue so much wrought To honour hir in bringing Italy To speake hir language, and to giue hir note Of all the treasure that rich tongue containes: Wherein I cannot but admire your paines In gathering vp this vniuersall store, And furniture of words for euery arte, And skill of man: So that there seem's no more Beyond this search, that knowledge can impart. Which being a worke which would take vp the powers Of more then one whole man, I wonder how You could subtract so many serious howres From that great summe of seruice that you owe. But that it seemes the beaming Gracefulnesse That lightens from the most refulgent Qveene Our sacred Mistris, work's that ablenesse As mak's you more, then els you could haue beene. Wherein the power of Princes well is seene That can infuse such force, and make age greene. And it were well, if in this season, when They leaue erecting Churches, Colledges, And pious monuments, they would build men Who of their glory may be witnesses, And what they doe be theirs: As Mazons raise Work's not for them, but for their masters praise. For, would they but be ples'd to know, how small A portion of that ouer-flowing waste Which run's from them, would turne the wheeles and all The frame of wit, to make their glory last: I thinke they would doe something: but the stirre Still about greatnesse, giues it not the space To looke out from it selfe, or to conferre Grace but by chance, and as men are in place. But that concern's not me, It is ynow I doe applaud your worke. Thus from my Plow. Samuel Daniel. From John Florio's 1613 edition of his “Done into English” Essayes written in French by Michael Lord of Montaigne. To my deare brother and friend M. Iohn Florio, one of the Gentlemen of hir Maiesties most Royall Priuie Chamber. Books, like superfluous humors bred with ease So stuffe the world, as it becomes opprest With taking more than it can well digest; And now are turn'd to be a great disease. For by this ouercharging we confound The appetite of skill they had before: There be'ng no end of words, nor any bound Set to conceit the Ocean without shore. As if man laboured with himselfe to be As infinite in writing, as intents; And draw his manifold vncertaintie In any shape that passion represents: That these innumerable images And figures of opinion and discourse Draw'n out in leaues, may be the witnesses Of our defects much rather than our force. And this proud frame of our presumption, This Babel of our skill, this Towre of wit, Seemes only checkt with the confusion Of our mistakings that dissolueth it. And well may make vs of our knowledge doubt, Seeing what vncertainties wee build vpon, To be as weake within booke as without; Or els that truth hath other shapes then one. But yet although wee labor with this store And with the presse of writings seeme opprest, And haue to many bookes, yet want wee more, Feeling great dearth and scarcenesse of the best; Which cast in choiser shapes haue bin produc'd, To giue the best proportions to the minde Of our confusion, and haue introduc'd The likeliest images frailtie can finde. And wherein most the skill-desiring soule Takes her delight, the best of all delight; And where her motions euenest come to rowle About this doubtfull center of the right.

Since Honor from the Honorer proceeds, How well do they deserue that memorie And leaue in bookes for all posterities The names of worthyes, and their vertuous deedes When all their glorie els, like water weedes Without their element, presently dyes, And all their greatnes quite forgotten lyes: And when, and how they florisht no man heedes. How poore remembrances, are statutes, Toomes And other monuments that men erect To Princes, which remaine in closed roomes Where but a few behold them; in respect Of Bookes, that to the vniuersall eye Shew how they liu'd, the other where they lye. From “The Essayes, of Morall Politike and Millitarie Discourses of Lo: Michaell de Montaigne, Kn?, 1603 edition.” To my deere friend M. Iohn Florio, concerning his translation of Montaigne. Bookes the amasse of humors, swolne with ease, The Griefe of peace, the maladie of rest; So stuffe the world, falne into this disease, As it receiues more then it can digest: And doe so ouercharge, as they confound The apetite of skill with idle store: There being no end of words, nor any bound Set to conceipt, the Ocean without shore. As if man labor'd with himselfe to be As infinite in words, as in intents, And drawe his manifold incertaintie In eu'ry figure, passion represents; That these inuumerable visages And strange shapes of opinions and discourse Shadowed in leaues, may be the witnesses Rather of our defects, then of our force. And this proud frame of our presumption, This Babel of our skill, this Towre of wit, Seemes onely checkt with the confusion Of our mistakings, that dissolueth it. And well may make vs of our knowledge doubt, Seeing what vncertainties we build vpon, To be as weake within booke as without; Or els that truth hath other shapes then one. But yet although we labor with this store And with the presse of writings seeme opprest, And haue too many bookes, yet want we more, Feeling great dearth and scarsenesse of the best; Which cast in choiser shapes haue bin produc'd, To giue the best proportions to the minde Of our confusion, and haue introduc'd The likeliest images frailtie can finde. And wherein most the skill-desiring soule Takes her delight, the best of all delight; And where her motions euenest come to rowle About this doubtfull center of the right. Which to discouer this great Potentate, This Prince Montaigne (if he be not more) Hath more aduentur'd of his owne estate Then euer man did of himselfe before: And hath made such bolde sallies out vpon Custome: the mightie tyrant of the earth, In whose Seraglio of subiection We all seeme bred-vp, from our tender birth; As I admire his powres, and out of loue, Here at his gate do stand; and glad I stand, So neere to him whom I do so much loue, T'applaude his happie setling in our land: And safe transpassage by his studious care, Who both of him and vs doth merit much; Hauing as sumptuously, as he is rare Plac'd him in the best lodging of our speach, And made him now as free, as if borne here, And as well ours as theirs, who may be proud That he is theirs; though he be euery where To haue the franchise of his worth allow'd. It being the portion of a happie Pen, Not to b'inuassal'd to one Monarchie, But dwell with all the better world of men Whose spirits are all of one communitie. Whom neither Ocean, Desarts, Rockes nor Sands Can keepe from th'intertraffique of the minde, But that it vents her treasure in all lands, And doth a most secure commercement finde. Wrap Excellencie vp neuer so much, In Hierogliphicques, Ciphers, Caracters, And let her speake neuer so strange a speach, Her Genius yet finds apt discipherers: And neuer was she borne to dye obscure, But guided by the Starres of her owne grace, Makes her owne fortune, and is euer sure In mans best hold, to hold the strongest place. And let the Critic say the worst he can, He cannot say but that Montaigne yet, Yeeldes most rich pieces and extracts of man; Though in a troubled frame confus'dly set.

To the Right Reuerend Father in God, Iames Montague, Lord Bishop of Winchester, Deane of the Chapell, and one of his Maiesties most Honorable Priuy Councell. Although you haue out of your proper store The best munition that may fortifie A Noble heart as no man may haue more, Against the batteries of mortality: Yet reuerend Lord voutsafe me leaue to bring One weapon more vnto your furnishment; That you the Assaults of this close vanquishing, And secret wasting sicknesse may preuent: For that my selfe haue struggled with it too, And know the worst of all that it can do; And let me tell you this you neuer could Haue found a gentler warring enemy, And one that with more faire proceeding would Encounter you without extremity, Nor giue more time to make resistances And to repaire your breaches, then will this. For whereas other sicknesses surprize, Our spirits at vnawares disweopning sodainely, All sense of vnderstanding in such wise, As that they lay vs dead before we die, Or fire vs out of our inflamed fort, With rauing Phrensies in a fearefull sort; This comes and steales vs by degrees away; And yet not that without our priuity They rap vs hence, as Vultures do their pray; Confounding vs with tortures instantly. This fairely kills, they fowly murther vs, Trippe vp our heeles before we can discerne; This giues vs time of treaty to discus Our suffring, and the cause thereof to learne. Besides therewith we oftentimes haue truce For many months, sometimes for many yeares, And are permitted to inioy the vse Of study, and although our body weares Our wit remaines; our speach, our memory Faile not, or come before our selues to die: We part together and we take our leaue Of friends, of kindred; we dispose our state, And yeeld vp fairely what we did receiue And all our businesses accomodate: So that we cannot say we were thrust out, But we depart from hence in quiet sort: The foe with whom we haue the battaile fought, Hath not subdu'd vs but got our Fort, And this disease is held most incident To the best natures and most innocent. And therefore reuerend Lord, there cannot be A gentler passage then there is hereby, Vnto that port wherein we shall be free From all the stormes of worldly misery. And though it show vs dayly in our glasse, Our fading leafe turn'd to a yellow hue, And how it withers as the sap doth passe, And what we may exspect is to insue. Yet that I know disquiets not your mind, Who knowes the brittle mettaile of mankind, And haue all comforts vertue can beget, And most the conscience of well acted dayes; Which all those monuments which you haue set On holy ground to your perpetuall praise, (As things best set) must euer testifie; And shew the worth of Noble Montague. And so long as the Walls of Piety Stand, so long shall stand the memory of you; And Bath, and Wells, and Winchester shall show Their faire repaires to all Posterity; And how much blest and fortunate they were That euer Gracious hand did plant you there; Besides, you haue not only built vp walls But also (worthier edifices) men; By whom you shall haue the memorialls And euerlasting honor of the pen That whensoeuer you shall come to make Your Exit from this Scene wherein you haue Perform'd so noble parts, you then shall take Your leaue with honor, haue a glorious graue. “For when can men go better to their rest “Then when they are esteem'd and loued best?” Sam.

What times fore-goe Richard the seconds Raigne, The fatall causes of this ciuile VVarre, His Vncles pride, his greedy Minions gaine, Glosters reuolt, and death, deliuered are. Herford, accus'd, exil'd, call'd-back againe, Pretendes t'amend what others Rule did marre. The King from Ireland hastes, but did no good; VVhil'st strange prodigious signes fore-token blood. 1 I sing the ciuill Warres, tumultuous Broyles, And bloody factions of a mightie Land: Whose people hautie, proud with forraine spoyles, Vpon themselues turn-backe their conquering hand; Whil'st Kin their Kin, Brother the Brother foyles; Like Ensignes all against like Ensignes band; Bowes against Bowes, the Crowne against the Crowne; Whil'st all pretending right, all right's throwne downe. 2 What / furie, ô what madnes held thee so, Deare England (too too prodigall of blood) To waste so much, and warre without a foe, Whilst Fraunce, to see thy spoyles, at pleasure stood! How much might'st thou haue purchast with lesse woe, T'haue done thee honour and thy people good? Thine might haue beene what-euer lies betweene The Alps and vs, the Pyrenei and Rhene. 3 Yet now what reason haue we to complaine? Since hereby came the calme we did inioy; The blisse of thee Eliza; happie gaine For all our losse: when-as no other way The Heauens could finde, but to vnite againe The fatall sev'red Families, that they Might bring foorth thee: that in thy peace might growe That glorie, which few Times could euer showe. 4 Come sacred Virtue: I no Muse, but thee, Inuoke, in this great labour I intend. Doo thou inspire my thoughts, infuse in mee A power to bring the same to happie end. Rayse vp a worke, for later times to see, That may thy glorie, and my paynes commend. Make me these tumults rightly to rehearse: And giue peace to my life, life to my verse. 5 And thou Charles Montioy (who didst once afford Rest for my fortunes, on thy quiet shore; And cheer'dst mee on, these measures to record In grauer tones, then I had vs'd before) Beholde: my gratitude makes good my word Ingag'd to thee (although thou be no more) That I, who heretofore haue liu'd by thee, Doo giue thee now a roome to liue with me. 6 And MEMORIE, preserv'resse of things done, Come thou, vnfold the woundes, the wracke, the waste: Reueale to me how all the strife begunne Twixt Lancaster and Yorke, in ages past: How causes, counsels, and euents did runne, So long as these vnhappie times did last; Vnintermixt with fiction's fantasies. I versifie the troth, not Poetize. 7 And to the ende wee may with better ease Discerne the true discourse; vouchsafe to showe, What were the times foregoing, neere to these, That these we may with better profit knowe: Tell, how the world fell into this disease, And how so great distemperature did growe. So shall we see, by what degrees it came, “How things, at full, do soone wex out of frame. 8 Ten Kings had, from the Norman Conqueror, raign'd, With intermixt and variable fate, When England to her greatest height attain'd Of powre, dominion, glorie, wealth, and State; After it had, with much adoo, sustain'd The violence of Princes, with debate For titles, and the often mutinies Of Nobles, for their ancient liberties. 9 For, first, the Norman, conquering all by might, By might was forc't to keepe what he had got; Mixing our Customes and the forme of Right With foraine Constitutions he had brought: Maistering the mightie, humbling the poorer wight By all seuerest meanes that could be wrought: And, making the succession oubtfull, rent This new-got State, and left it turbulent. 10 VViliam his sonne, tracing his fathers wayes (The great men spent in peace, or slaine in fight) Vpon depressed weaknes onely preyes, And makes his force maintaine his doubtfull right: His elder brothers clayme, vexing his dayes, His actions and exactions still incite: And giuing Beastes, what did to Men pertaine (Tooke for a Beast) himselfe in th'end was slaine. 11 His brother Henrie next commands the State: Who, Roberts title better to reiect, Seekes to repacifie the peoples hate; And with faire shewes, rather then in effect, Allayes those grieuances that heauie sate: Reformes the lawes, which soone hee did neglect; And rest of sonnes, for whom he did prepare, Leaues crowne and strife, to Maude his daughters care. 12 Whom Stephen his nephew (falsifying his Oath) Preuents; assayles the Realme; obtaines the Crowne; Such tumults raysing as torment them both, Whil'st both held nothing certainely their owne: Th'afflicted State (diuided in their troth And partiall faith) most miserable growne, Endures the while, till peace, and Stephens death, Gaue some calme leasure to recouer breath. 13 When Henrie, sonne to Maude the Empresse, raignes, And England into forme and greatnes brought, Addes Ireland to this Scepter, and obtaines Large Prouinces in Fraunce; much treasure gote, And from exactions here at home abstaynes: And had not his rebellious children sought T'imbroyle his age with tumults, he had beene The happiest Monarch that this State had seene. 14 Him, Richard followes in the gouernment: Who much the glory of our Armes increast; And all his fathers mighty treasure spent, In that deuoutfull Action of the East: Whereto, whiles he his forces wholly bent, Despight and treason his designes opprest; A faithlesse brother, and a fatall King, Cut-off his growth of glory, in the spring. 15 Which wicked brother, contrary to course, False Iohn vsurpes his Nephew Arthurs right; Gets to the Crowne by craft, by wrong, by force; Rules it with lust, oppression, rigour, might; Murders the lawfull heire without remorse: Wherefore procuring all the worlds despight, A Tyrant loath'd, a homicide conuented, Poysoned he dyes, disgrac't and vnlamented. 16 Henrie his sonne is chosen King, though young, And Lewes of France (elected first) beguil'd; After the mighty had debated long, Doubtfull to choose a straunger or a child: With him, the Barrons (in these times growne strong) Warre for their auncient Lawes so long exil'd. He graunts the Charter that pretended ease; Yet kept his owne, and did his State appease. 17 Edward, his sonne, a Martiall King, succeedes; Iust, prudent, graue, religious, fortunate: Whose happy ordered Raigne most fertile breedes, Plenty of mighty spirits to strength his State: And worthy mindes, to manage worthy deedes, Th'experience of those times ingenerate: For, euer great imployment, for the great, Quickens the blood, and honour doth beget. 18 And had not his mis-led lasciuious Sonne, Edward the second, intermitted so The course of glory happily begunne (Which brought him and his fauorites to woe) That happy current without stop had runne Vnto the full of his sonne Edwards flowe: But, who hath often seene, in such a State, Father and Sonne like good, like fortunate? 19 But now, this great Succeeder, all repaires, And reinduc't that discontinued good: He builds vp strength &amp; greatnes, for his heires, Out of the virtues that adornd his blood: He makes his Subiects Lords of more then theirs; And sets their bounds farre wider then they stood. His powre, and fortune, had sufficient wrought, Could but the State haue kept what he had got. 20 And had his heire surviu'd him in due course, What limits England hadst thou found? what barre? What world could haue resisted so great force? O more then men! (two thunderbolts of warre) Why did not Time your ioyned worth diuorce, T'haue made your seueral glories greater farre? Too prodigall was Nature, thus to doe; To spend in one Age, what should serue for two. 21 But now the Scepter, in this glorious State, Supported with strong powre and victorie, Was left vnto a Child; ordain'd by fate To stay the course of what might growe too hie: Here was a stop, that Greatnesse did abate, When powre vpon so weake a base did lie. For, least great fortune should presume too farre, Such oppositions interposed are. 22 Neuer this Iland better peopled stood; Neuer more men of might, and minds addrest: Neuer more Princes of the royall blood, (If not too many for the publique Rest) Nor euer was more treasure, wealth and good; Then when this Richard first, the Crowne possest; The second of that name, in two accurst: And well we might haue mist all, but the first. 23 In this mans Raigne, began this fatal strife (The bloudie argument whereof we treate) That dearely cost so many'a Prince his life; And spoyld the weake, and euen consum'd the great: That, wherein all confusion was so rife, As Memory euen grieues her to repeat, And would that time might now this knowledge lose; But that tis good to learne by others woes. 24 Edward the third, being dead, had left this child, (Sonne of his worthy sonne deceast of late) The Crowne and Scepter of this Realme to wield: Appointing the protectors of his State Two of his sonnes, to be his better shield; Supposing Vncles, free from guile or hate, Would order all things for his better good, In the respect and honour of their bloud. 25 Of these, Iohn, Duke of Lancaster, was one, (Too great a Subiect growne, for such a State. The title of a King, and glorie wonne In great exploits his mind did eleuate Aboue proportion kingdomes stand vpon: Which made him push at what his issue gate) The other, Langley: whose mild temperatness Did tend vnto a calmer quietnesse. 26 With these, did Woodstock interpose his part; A man, for action violently bent, And of a spirit averse, and ouer-thwart; Which could not sute a peace-full gouernment: Whose euer-swelling, and tumultuous heart Wrought his owne ill and others discontent. And these had all the manage of affayres, During the time the King was vnder yeares. 27 And in the first yeares of his gouernment, Things past, as first; the warres in France proceed, Though not with that same fortune and euent, Being now not followed with such carefull heed; Our people here at home, growne discontent, Through great exactions, insurrections breed: Priuate respects hindred the Common-weale: And idle ease doth on the mighty steale. 28 Too many Kings breed factions in the Court: The head too weake, the members growne too great. Which euermore doth happen in this sort, When Children rule; the plague which God doth threat Vnto those Kingdomes which he will transport To other Lynes, or vtterly defeat: “For, the ambitious, once inur'd to raigne, “Can neuer brook a priuate state againe. 29 “And Kingdomes euer suffer this distresse, “Where one, or many, guide the infant King: “Which one or many (tasting this excesse “Of greatnesse &amp; command) can neuer bring “Their thoughts againe t'obay, or to be lesse. “From hence, these insolencies euer spring; “Contempt of others, whom they seek to foyle: “Then follow leagues, destruction, ruine, spoyle. 30 And whether they, which vnder-went this charge, Permit the King to take a youthfull vaine, That they their priuate better might inlarge: Or whether he himselfe would farther straine (Thinking his yeeres sufficient to discharge The gouernment) and so assum'd the raine: Or howsoeuer, now his eare he lends To youthfull counsell, and his lustes attends. 31 And Courts were neuer barren yet of those Which could with subtile traine, and apt aduice, Worke on the Princes weakenesse, and dispose Of feeble frailtie, easie to entice. And such, no doubt, about this King arose, Whose flatterie (the dangerous nurse of vice) Got hand vpon his youth, to pleasures bent: Which, led by them, did others discontent. 32 For, now his Vncles grew much to mislike These ill proceedings; were it that they saw That others, fauour'd, did aspiring seeke Their Nephew from their counsels to withdraw, (Seeing him of nature flexible, and weake) Because they onely would keepe all in awe; Or that indeede they found the King and State Abus'd by such as now in office sate. 33 Or rather else, they all were in the fault; Th'ambitious Vncles, th'indiscreete young King, The greedie Councell, and the Minions naught; And altogether did this tempest bring: Besides, the times, with all iniustice fraught, Concurr'd, with such confus'd misgouerning, That wee may truely say, This spoyld the State, “Youthfull Counsaile, priuate Gaine, partiall Hate. 34 And then the King, besides his iealousies Which nourisht were, had reason to be led To doubt his Vncles for their loyalties; Since Iohn of Gaunt (as was discouered) Had practised his death in secret wise; And Gloster openly becomes the head Vnto a league, who all in armes were bent T'oppose against the present gouernement; 35 Pretending to remoue such men as were Accounted to abuse the king, and State. Of whome, the chiefe they did accuse, was Veere, Made Duke of Ireland, with great grace of late; And diuers else, who for the place they beare Obnoxious are, and subiect vnto hate. And these must be sequestred with all speed: Or else they vow'd, their swordes should doo the deed. 36 The King was forc't in that next Parliament, To grant them what he durst not well refuse. For, thither arm'd they came, and fully bent To suffer no repulse, nor no excuse: And here they did accomplish their intent; Where Iustice did her sword, not Ballance, vse. For, euen that sacred place they violate, Arresting all the Iudges as they sate. 37 And here had many worthy men their ende, Without all forme, or any course of Right. “For, still these broyles, that publike good pretend, “Worke most iniustice, being done through spight. “For, those aggrieued euermore do bend “Against such as they see of greatest might: “Who, though they cannot helpe what will go ill; “Yet, since they may doo wrong, are thought they will. 38 And yet herein I meane not to excuse The Iustices, and Minions of the King (Who might their office and their grace abuse) But blame the course held in the managing: “For, great-men, ouer-grac't, much rigor vse; “Presuming fauorits discontentment bring: “And disproportions harmonie do breake; “Minions, too great, argue a king too weake. 39 Now, that so much was granted, as was sought; A reconcilement made, although not ment, Appeas'd them all in shewe, but not in thought, Whilst euery one seem'd outwardly content: Though hereby king, nor peeres, nor people got More loue, more strength, or easier gouernment; But euery day, things still succeeded worse. “For good from Kings is seldome drawne by force. 40 And thus it loe continued, till by chaunce The Queene (which was the Emperours daughter) di'de: When-as the King, t'establish peace with Fraunce, And better for home-quiet to prouide, Sought by contracting marriage to aduance His owne affayres, against his Vncles pride; Tooke the young daughter of King Charles to wife: Which after, in the end, rays'd greater strife. 41 For, now his vncle Gloster much repin'd, Against this French alliance and this peace: As either out of a tumultuous minde; (Which neuer was content the warres should cease:) Or that he did dishonorable finde Those articles which did our State decrease; And therefore storm'd because the Crowne had wrong: Or that he fear'd, the King would growe too strong. 42 But whatsoeuer mou'd him; this is sure, Hereby he wrought his ruine in the end; And was a fatall cause, that did procure The swift approching mischiefes that attend. For loe, the King no longer could indure Thus to be crost in what he did intend; And therefore watcht but some occasion fit T'attache the Duke, when he thought least of it. 43 And Fortune, to set forward this intent, The Cont S. Paule, from France, doth hither bring: Whom Charles the sixt imploy'd in complement, To see the Queene, and to salute the King. To whom he shewes his Vncles discontent, And of his secret dangerous practising, How he his Subiectes sought to sulleuate, And breake the league with Fraunce concluded late. 44 To whom the Cont, most cunningly replies; “Great Prince, it is within your power, with ease “To remedy such feares, such iealousies, “And rid you of such mutiners as these; “By cutting off that, which might greater rise, “And now at first, preuenting this disease, “And that before he shall your wrath disclose; “For, who threats first, meanes of reuenge doth lose. 45 “First take his head, then tell the reason why: “Stand not to finde him guiltie by your lawes; “You easier shall with him your quarrell trie “Dead then aliue, who hath the better cause. “For, in the murmuring vulgar, vsually “This publique course of yours compassion drawes; “Especially in cases of the great: “Which worke much pitty, in the vndiscreat. 46 “And this is sure, though his offence be such: “Yet doth calamitie attract commorse: “And men repine at Princes blood-shed much, “(How iust-soeuer) iudging tis by force. “I know not how their death giues such a tuch, “In those that reach not to a true discourse; “As so shall you, obseruing formall right, “Be held still as vniust, and win more spight. 47 “And, oft, the cause may come preuented so: “And therefore when tis done, let it be heard. “For, thereby shall you scape your priuate wo. “And satisfie the world too, afterward. “What neede you weigh the rumors that shall go? “What is that breath, being with your life compar'd? “And therefore, if you will be rul'd by me, “In secret sort, let him dispatched bee. 48 And then arraigne the chiefe of those you finde Were of his faction secretly compact: Who may so well be handled in their kinde; As their confessions, which you shall exact, May both appease the aggrieued peoples minde, And make their death to aggrauate their fact. So shall you rid your selfe of dangers quite; And shew the world, that you haue done but right. 49 This counsell, vttred vnto such an eare As willing listens to the safest wayes, Workes on the yeelding matter of his feare; Which easily to any course obayes. For, euery Prince, seeing his daunger neere, By any meanes his quiet peace assaies. “And still the greatest wrongs, that euer were, “Haue then been wrought, when Kings were put in feare. 50 Call'd in with publique pardon, and release, The Duke of Gloster, with his complices; All tumults, all contentions seem to cease, The land rich, people pleas'd, all in happinesse: When sodainely Gloster came caught, with peace; VVarwicke, with profered loue and promises: And Arundell was in, with cunning brought: Who else abrode, his safetie might haue wrought. 51 Long was it not, ere Gloster was conuayd To Calice, and there strangled secretly: VVarwicke and Arundell close prisoners laid, Th'especiall men of his confederacie: Yet VVarwickes teares and base confessions staide The doome of death; and came confin'd thereby, And so prolongs this not long base-begg'd breath: But Arundell was put to publique death. 52 Which publique death (receiu'd with such a cheare, As not a sigh, a looke, a shrink bewrayes The least felt touch of a degenerous feare) Gaue life to Enuie, to his courage prayse; And made his stout-defended cause appeare With such a face of Right, as that it layes The side of wrong t'wards him, who had long since By Parliament forgiuen this offence: 53 And in the vnconceiuing vulgar sort, Such an impression of his goodnes gaue As Sainted him, and rays'd a strange report Of miracles effected on his Graue: Although the Wise (whome zeale did not transport) “Knew, how each great example still must haue “Something of wrong, a taste of violence; “Wherewith, the publique quiet doth dispense. 54 The King foorth-with prouides him of a Guard; A thousand Archers daily to attend: Which now vpon the act he had prepar'd, As th'argument his actions to defend: But yet the world hereof conceiu'd so hard, That all this nought auaild him in the end. “In vaine, with terror is he fortified, “That is not guarded with firme loue beside. 55 Now storme his grieued Vncles, though in vaine; Not able better courses to aduise. They might their grieuance inwardly complaine; But outwardly they needes must temporise. The King was great; and they should nothing gaine T'attempt reuenge, or offer once to rise: This league with Fraunce had made him now so strong, That they must needes as yet indure this wrong. 56 For, like a Lion that escapes his boundes, Hauing beene long restrain'd his vse to stray, Ranges the restless woods, stayes on no gro?d, Riots with blood-shed, wantons on his praie; Seekes not for neede, but in his pride to wound, Glorying to see his strength and what he may: So this vnbridled King (freed of his feares) In liberty, himself thus wildely beares. 57 For, standing now alone, he sees his might Out of the compasse of respectiue awe; And now beginnes to violate all right, While no restraining feare at hand he saw. Now he exacts of all, wastes in delight, Riots in pleasure, and neglects the law: He thinkes his Crowne is licenst to do ill. “That lesse should list, that may do what it wil. 58 Thus b'ing transported in this sensuall course, No friend to warne, no counsell to withstand, He still proceedeth on from bad to worse; Sooth'd in all actions that he tooke in hand, By such as all impietie did nurse, Commending euer what hee did command. “Vnhappie Kings! that neuer may be taught “To know themselues, or to discerne their fault. 59 And whilst this course did much the kingdome daunt, The Duke of Herford being of courage bolde, As sonne and heire to mighty Iohn of Gaunt, Vtters the passion which he could not holde Concerning these oppressions, and the want Of gouernment: which he to Norfolke told; To th'end, he (being great about the king) Might do some good, by better counselling. 60 Hereof doth Norfolke presently take hold, And to the king the whole discourse relate: Who, not conceipting it, as it was told, But iudging it proceeded out of hate; Disdeigning deepely to be so controwl'd, That others should his Rule preiudicate, Charg'd Herford therewithall: who re-accus'd Norfolke, for words of treason he had vs'd. 61 Norfolke denies them peremptorily. Herford recharg'd, and supplicates the king, To haue the combate of his enemie; That by his sword hee might approue the thing. Norfolke desires the same, as earnestly: And both with equall courage menacing Reuenge of wrong; that none knew which was free: For, times of faction, times of slaunder bee. 62 The combate granted, and the day assign'd, They both in order of the field appeare, Most richly furnisht in all Martiall kinde, And at the point of intercombate were; When (lo) the king chang'd sodainely his minde, Casts downe his warder to arrest them there; As being aduis'd a better way to take, Which might for his more certaine safetie make. 63 For, now considering (as it likely might) The victorie should hap on Herfords side (A man most valiant and of noble sprite, Belou'd of all, and euer worthy tri'd) How much he might be grac't in publique sight, By such an act, as might aduance his pride, And so become more popular by this; Which he feares, too much he already is. 64 And therefore he resolues to banish both, Though th'one in chiefest fauour with him stood, A man he dearely lou'd; and might be loth To leaue him, that had done him so much good: Yet hauing cause to do as now he doth, To mitigate the enuie of his blood, Thought best to lose a friend, to rid a foe; And such a one, as now he doubted so. 65 And therefore to perpetuall exile hee Mowbray condemnes; Herford but for ten yeares: Thinking (for that the wrong of this decree, Compar'd with greater rigour, lesse appeares) It might of all the better liked bee: But yet such murmuring of the fact he heares, That he is faine foure of the ten forgiue, And iudg'd him sixe yeares in exile to liue. 66 At whose departure hence out of the Land, How did the open multitude reueale The wondrous loue they bare him vnder-hand! Which now, in this hote passion of their zeale, They plainely shew'd; that all might vnderstand How deare he was vnto the common weale. They feard not to exclaime against the King; As one, that sought all good mens ruining. 67 Vnto the shore, with teares, with sighes, with mone, They him conduct; cursing the bounds that stay Their willing feete, that would haue further gone, Had not the fearefull Ocean stopt their way: “Why Neptune, Hast thou made vs stand alone “Diuided from the world, for this, say they? “Hemd-in, to be a spoyle to tyrannie, “Leauing affliction hence no way to flie? 68 “Are we lockt vp, poore soules, heere to abide “Within the waterie prison of thy waues, “As in a fold, where subiect to the pride “And lust of Rulers we remaine as slaues? “Here in the reach of might, where none can hide “From th'eye of wrath, but onely in their Graues? “Happie confiners you of other landes, “That shift your soyle, and oft scape tyrants hands. 69 “And must we leaue him here, whom here were fit “We should retaine, the pillar of our State? “Whose vertues well deserue to gouerne it, “And not this wanton young effeminate. “Why should not he in Regall honour sit, “That best knowes how a Realme to ordinate? “But, one day yet, we hope thou shalt bring backe “(Deare Bullingbrooke) the Iustice that we lacke. 70 “Thus muttred, loe, the malecontented sort; “That loue Kings best, before they haue them, still; “And neuer can the present State comport, “But would as often change, as they change will. For, this good Duke had wonne them in this sort By succ'ring them, and pittying of their ill, That they supposed streight it was one thing, To be both a good Man, and a good King. 71 When-as the grauer sort that saw the course, And knew that Princes may not be controld, Lik't well to suffer this, for feare of worse; “Since, many great, one Kingdome cannot hold. For, now they saw, intestine strife, of force, The apt-diuided State intangle would, If he should stay whom they would make their head, By whom the vulgar body might be led. 72 “They saw likewise, that Princes oft are faine “To buy their quiet, with the price of wrong: And better 'twere that now a few complaine, Then all should mourne, aswell the weake as strong: Seeing still how little Realmes by chaunge do gaine; And therefore learned by obseruing long, “T'admire times past, follow the present will, “Wish for good Princes, but t'indure the ill. 73 For, when it nought auailes, what folly then To striue against the current of the time? Who will throwe downe himselfe, for other men, That make a ladder by his fall to clime? Or who would seeke t'imbroyle his Country, when He might haue rest; suffering but others crime? “Since wise men euer haue preferred farre “Th'vniustest peace, before the iustest warre. 74 Thus they considered, that in quiet sate, Rich or content, or else vnfit to striue: Peace-louer wealth, hating a troublous State, Doth willing reasons for their rest contriue: But, if that all were thus considerate, How should in Court, the great, the fauour'd thriue? Factions must be, and these varieties: And some must fall, that other-some may rise. 75 But, long the Duke remain'd not in exile, Before that Iohn of Gaunt, his father, dies: Vpon whose state the king seis'd now, this while, Disposing of it, as his enemies. This open wrong no longer could beguile The world, that saw these great indignities. Which so exasperates the mindes of all, That they resolu'd, him home againe to call. 76 For, now they saw, t'was malice in the King (Transported in his ill-conceiued thought) That made him so to prosecute the thing Against all law, and in a course so naught. And this aduantage to the Duke did bring More fit occasions; whereupon he wrought. “For, to a man so strong, and of such might, “He giues him more, that takes away his right. 77 The King in this meane time (I know not how) Was drawne into some actions, foorth the Land, T'appease the Irish, that reuolted now: And, there attending what he had in hand, Neglects those parts from whence worse dangers growe; As ignorant, how his affayres did stand: Whether the plot was wrought it should be so, Or that his fate did draw him on to go. 78 Most sure it is, that hee committed here An ignorant and idle ouersight; Not looking to the Dukes proceedings there, Being in the Court of Fraunce, where best he might; Where both the King and all assured were T'haue stopt his course, being within their right; But now he was exil'd, he thought him sure; And, free from farther doubting, liv'd secure. 79 So blindes the sharpest counsels of the wise This ouershadowing Prouidence on hie; And dazleth all their clearest sighted eyes, That they see not how nakedly they lie. There where they little thinke, the storme doth rise, And ouercasts their cleare securitie: When man hath stopt all wayes saue onely that, Which (as least doubted) Ruine enters at. 80 And now was all disorder in th'excesse, And whatsoeuer doth a change portend; As, idle luxurie, and wantonnesse, Proteus-like varying Pride, vaine without ende: Wrong-worker Riot (motiue to oppresse) Endless Exactions, which the idle spend; Consuming Vsurie, and credits crackt, Call'd-on this purging Warre, that many lackt. 81 Then Ill-perswading want, in Martiall mindes, And wronged patience (long opprest with might) Loosenes in all (which no religion bindes) Commaunding force (the measure made of Right) Gaue fuell to this fire, that easie findes The way t'inflame the whole indangerd quite: These were the publique breeders of this Warre; By which, still greatest States confounded are. 82 For, now this peace with Fraunce had shut in here The ouergrowing humours Warres do spend. For, where t'euacuate no imployments were, Wider th'vnwieldy burthen doth distend, Men, wholly vs'd to warre, peace could not beare; As knowing no other course, whereto to bend: For, brought vp in the broyles of these two Reames, They thought best fishing still, in troubled streames. 83 Like to a Riuer, that is stopt his course, Doth violate his bankes, breakes his owne bed, Destroyes his bounds, and ouer-runs, by force, The neighbour-fieldes, irregularly spred: Euen so this sodaine stop of Warre doth nurse Home broyles, within it selfe, from others led: So dangerous the change hereof is tri'd Ere mindes 'come soft, or otherwise imploid. 84 But, all this makes for thee, ô Bullingbrooke, To worke a way vnto thy Soueraintie. This care, the Heauens, Fate, and Fortune tooke, To bring thee to thy Scepter easily. Vpon thee fall's that hap, which him forsooke, Who, crownd a King, a King yet must not die. Thou wert ordaind, by Prouidence, to rayse A quarrell, lasting longer then thy dayes. 85 For, now this absent Lord, out of his Land (Where though he shew'd great sprite and valor then; Being attended with a worthy band Of valiant Peeres, and most couragious men) Gaue time to them at home, that had in hand Th'vngodly worke, and knew the season when: Who faile not to aduise the Duke with speed; Solliciting to what hee soone agreed. 86 Who presently, vpon so good report, Relying on his friends fidelitie, Conueyes himselfe out of the French Kings Court, Vnder pretence to go to Britannie: And, with his followers, that to him resort, Landed in England: Welcom'd ioyfully Of th'altring vulgar, apt for changes still; As headlong carried with a present will. 87 And com'n to quiet shore, but not to rest; The first night of his ioyfull landing here, A fearefull vision doth his thoughts molest: Seeming to see in reuerent forme appeare A faire and goodly woman all distrest; Which, with full-weeping eyes and rented haire, Wringing her hands (as one that griev'd and prayd) With sighes commixt with words, vnto him said; 88 “O! whither dost thou tend, my vnkinde Sonne? “What mischiefe dost thou go-about to bring “To her, whose Genius thou here lookst vpon, “Thy Mother-countrey, whence thy selfe didst spring? “Whither thus dost thou, in ambition, run, “To change due course, by foule disordering? “What bloodshed, what turmoyles dost thou commence, “To last for many wofull ages hence? 89 “Stay here thy foote, thy yet vnguilty foote, “That canst not stay when thou art farther in, “Retire thee yet vnstain'd, whil'st it doth boote; “The end, is spoyle, of what thou dost begin: “Iniustice neuer yet tooke lasting roote, “Nor held that long, Impietie did win. “The babes, vnborne, shall (ô) be borne to bleed “In this thy quarrell, if thou do proceede. 90 This said, she ceast: when he in troubled thought Griev'd at this tale and sigh't, and thus replies; “Deare Countrey, ô I haue not hither brought “These Armes to spoyle, but for thy liberties: “The sinne be on their head, that this haue wrought; “Who wrongd me first, and thee do tyrannise. “I am thy Champion, and I seeke my right: “Prouok't I am to this, by others spight. 91 “This, this pretence, saith shee, th'ambitious finde “To smooth iniustice, and to flatter wrong. “Thou dost not know what then will be thy minde, “When thou shalt see thy selfe aduanc't and strong. “When thou hast shak't off that, which others binde; “Thou soone forgettest what thou learnedst long. “Men do not know what then themselues will bee, “When-as, more then themselues, themselues they see. 92 And herewithall, turning about he wakes, Lab'ring in spirit, troubled with this strange sight: And mus'd a while, waking aduisement takes Of what had past in sleepe and silent night: Yet hereof no important reck'ning makes, But as a dreame that vanisht with the light: The day designes, and what he had in hand Left it to his diuerted thoughts vnscand. 93 Doubtfull at first, he warie doth proceed; Seemes not t'affect that, which he did effect; Or else perhaps seemes, as he meant indeed, Sought but his owne, and did no more expect. Then, Fortune, thou art guiltie of his deed: That didst his state aboue his hopes erect: And thou must beare some blame of his great sinne; That leftst him worse, then when he did beginne. 94 Thou didst conspire with Pride, and with the Time, To make so easie an ascent to wrong, That he who had no thought so hie to clime (With fauouring comfort still allur'd along) Was with occasion thrust into the crime; Seeing others weakenes and his part so strong. “And who is there, in such a case that will “Do good, and feare, that may liue free with ill? 95 We will not say nor thinke, O Lancaster, But that thou then didst meane as thou didst sweare Vpon th'Euangelists at Doncaster, In th'eye of heauen, and that assembly theare, That thou but as an vpright orderer, Sought'st to reforme th'abused Kingdome here, And get thy right, and what was thine before; And this was all; thou would'st attempt no more: 96 Though we might say, and thinke, that this pretence Was but a shadow to the intended act; Because th'euent doth argue the offence, And plainely seemes to manifest the fact: For that hereby thou mightst win confidence With those, whom else thy course might hap distract, And all suspicion of thy drift remoue; “Since easily men credit whom they loue. 97 But, God forbid wee should so neerly pry Into the lowe-deepe-buried sinnes long past, T'examine and conferre iniquitie, Whereof faith would no memorie should last: That our times might not haue t'exemplifie With aged staines, but, with our owne shame cast, Might thinke our blot the first, not done before; That new-made sinnes might make vs blush the more. 98 And let vnwresting Charitie beleeue That then thy oath with thy intent agreed; And others faith, thy faith did first deceiue; Thy after-fortune forc't thee to this deed. And let no man this idle censure giue, Because th'euent proues so, 'twas so decreed. “For, oft our counsels sort to other end, “Then that which frailtie did at first intend. 99 Whil'st those that are but outward lookers on (Who sildome sound these mysteries of State) Deeme things were so contriv'd as they are done, And hold that policie, which was but fate; Imagining, all former acts did run Vnto that course they see th'effects relate; Whil'st still too short they come, or cast too far, “And make these great men wiser then they ar. 100 But, by degrees he ventures now on blood; And sacrifiz'd, vnto the peoples loue, The death of those that chiefe in enuie stood: As, th'Officers (who first these dangers proue) The Treasurer, and those whom they thought good, Busby and Greene, by death he must remoue: These were the men, the people thought, did cause Those great exactions, and abus'd the lawes. 101 This done, his cause was preacht with learned skill, By Arundel, th'Archbishop: who there show'd A Pardon sent from Rome, to all that will Take part with him, and quit the faith they ow'd To Richard; as a Prince vnfit and ill: On whom the Crowne was fatally bestow'd. And easie-yeelding zeale was quickly caught, With what the mouth of grauity had taught. 102 O that this power, from euerlasting giuen (The great alliance made twixt God and vs; Th'intelligence that earth doth hold with heauen) Sacred Religion; ô that thou must thus Be made to smooth our wayes vniust, vneuen; Brought from aboue, earth-quarrels to discusse! Must men beguile our soules, to winne our wils, And make our Zeale the furtherer of ils? 103 But, the ambitious, to aduance their might, Dispense with heauen, and what Religion would. “The armed will finde right, or els make right; If this meanes wrought not, yet an other should. And this and other now do all incite To strength the faction that the Duke doth hold: Who easily obtained what he sought; His vertues and his loue so greatly wrought. 104 The King, still busied in this Irish warre (Which by his valour there did well succeed) Had newes, how here his Lords reuolted are, And how the Duke of Herford doth proceede: In these, affaires he feares are growne too farre; Hastes his returne from thence with greatest speed: But was by tempests, windes, and seas debarr'd; As if they likewise had against him warr'd. 105 But, at the length (though late) in Wales he lands: Where, thoroughly inform'd of Henries force, And well aduertis'd how his owne case stands (Which to his griefe he sees tends to the worse) He leaues t'Aumarle, at Milford, all those bandes He brought from Ireland: taking thence his course To Conway (all disguis'd) with fourteene more, To th'Earle of Salisburie, thither sent before: 106 Thinking, the Earle had rays'd some Armie there; Whom there he findes forsaken all alone: The forces, in those parts which leuied were, Were closely shrunke away, disperst and gone. The king had stayd too long; and they, in feare, Resolued euerie man to shift for one. At this amas'd, such fortune he laments; Foresees his fall, whereto each thing consents. 107 In this disturb'd tumultuous broken State, Whil'st yet th'euent stood doubtfull what should bee; Whilst nought but headlong running to debate, And glittering troupes and armor, men might see: Furie, and feare, compassion, wrath, and hate, Confus'd through all the land, no corner free; The strong, all mad, to strife, to ruine bent; The weaker waild: the aged they lament, 108 And blame their many yeeres that liue so long, To see the horrour of these miseries. Why had not we (said they) di'd with the strong, In forraine fieldes, in honourable wise, In iust exployts, and noble without wrong, And by the valiant hand of enemies? And not thus now reserued, in our age, To home-confusion, and disordered rage. 109 Vnto the Temples flocke the weake, deuout, Sad wayling Women; there to vow and pray For husbands, brothers, or their sonnes gone out To blood-shed: whom nor teares, nor loue could stay. Here, graue religious Fathers (which much doubt The sad euents these broyles procure them may) As Prophets warne, exclaime, disswade these crimes, By the examples fresh of other times. 110 And (ô!) what, do you now prepare, said they, Another Conquest, by these fatall wayes? What, must your owne hands make your selues a pray To desolation, which these tumults rayse? What Dane, what Norman, shall prepare his way To triumph on the spoyle of your decayes? That, which nor Fraunce, nor all the world, could do In vnion, shall your discord bring you to? 111 Conspire against vs, neighbour nations all, That enuie at the height whereto w'are growne: Coniure the barbarous North, and let them call Strange furie from farre distant shores vnknowne; And let them altogether on vs fall, So to diuert the ruine of our owne: That we, forgetting what doth so incense, May turne the hand of malice, to defence. 112 Calme these tempestuous spirits, O mighty Lord; This threatning storme that ouer-hangs the Land. Make them consider, ere they 'vnsheath the sword, How vaine is th'earth, this point whereon they stand; And with what sad calamities is stor'd The best of that, for which th'Ambitious band: “Labor the ende of labor, strife of strife; “Terror in death, and horrour after life. 113 Thus they in zeale, whose humbled thoughts were good, Whil'st in this wide-spread volume of the skies, The booke of Prouidence disclosed stood; Warnings of wrath, foregoing miseries In lines of fire and characters of blood, Their fearefull formes in dreadfull flames arise; Amazing Comets, threatning Monarchs might, And new-seene Starres, vnknowne vnto the night. 114 Red fierie Dragons in the ayre do flye, And burning Meteors, pointed-streaming lightes: Bright Starres in midst of day appeare in skie, Prodigious monsters, ghastly fearefull sights: Strange Ghostes, and apparitions terrifie: The wofull mother her owne birth affrightes; Seeing a wrong deformed infant borne, Grieues in her paines, deceiv'd in shame doth mourne. 115 The earth, as if afeard of blood and wounds, Trembles in terrour of these falling bloes: The hollow concaues giue out groning sounds, And sighing murmures, to lament our woes: The Ocean, all at discord with his boundes, Reiterates his strange vntimely flowes: Nature all out of course, to checke our course, Neglects her worke, to worke in vs remorse. 116 So great a wracke vnto it selfe doth, lo, Disorder'd proud mortalitie prepare, That this whole frame doth euen labour so Her ruine vnto frailty to declare: And trauailes to fore-signifie the wo That weake improuidence could not beware. “For heauen and earth, and ayre and seas and all, “Taught men to see, but not to shun their fall. 117 Is man so deare vnto the heauens, that they Respect the wayes of earth, the workes of sinne? Doth this great All, this Vniuersall, weigh The vaine designes that weakenesse doth begin? Or doth our feare, father of zeale, giue way Vnto this errour ignorance liues in? And deeme our faults the cause that moue these powres, That haue their cause from other cause then ours? 118 But, these beginnings had this impious Warre, Th'vngodly blood-shed that did so defile The beautie of thy fields, and euen did marre The flowre of thy chiefe pride, thou fairest Ile: These were the causes that incenst so farre The ciuill wounding hand inrag'd with spoyle; That now the liuing, with afflicted eye, Looke backe with griefe on such calamitie. The end of the first Booke. THE SECOND BOOKE. THE ARGVMENT. King Richard mones his wrong, and wails his raigne: And here betrayd, to London he is led, Basely attyr'd, attending Herfords traine: Where th'one is scornd, the other VVelcomed. His Wife, mistaking him, doth much complaine; And both togither greatly sorrowed: In hope to saue his life and ease his thrall, He yeelds vp state, and Rule, and Crowne, and all. 1 In dearth of faith, and scarcitie of friendes, The late great mighty Monarch, on the shore In th'vtmost corner of his Land, attendes To call backe false obedience, fled before; Toyles, and in vaine his toyle, and labour spendes: More harts he sought to gaine, he lost the more: All turn'd their faces to the rising sunne, And leaue his setting-fortune, night begunne. 2 Percy, how soone, by thy example led, The household traine forsooke their wretched Lord! When, with thy staffe of charge dishonoured, Thou brak'st thy fayth, not steward of thy word, And tookst his part that after tooke thy head; When thine owne hand had strengthned first his sword. “For, such great merits do vpbraid, and call “For great reward, or thinke the great too smal. 3 And Kings loue not to be beholding ought: Which makes their chiefest friends oft speed the worst. For, those, by whom their fortunes haue bin wrought, Put them in minde of what they were at first. Whose doubtfull faith if once in question brought, Tis thought they will offend because they durst: And taken in a fault are neuer spar'd; “Being easier to reuenge, then to reward. 4 And thus these mightie actors, sonnes of change, These partizanes of factions, often tri'd; That, in the smoake of Innouations strange, Builde huge vncertaine plots of vnsure pride: And, on the hazard of a bad exchange, Haue ventur'd all the stocke of life beside; “Whilst Princes, rais'd, disdaine to haue bin rais'd “By those whose helpes deserue not to be prais'd. 5 But thus is Richard left, and all alone Saue with th'vnarmed title of his right; And those braue troupes, his fortune-followers gone, And all that pompe (the complements of might) Th'amuzing shadowes that are cast vpon The state of Princes, to beguile the sight, All vanisht cleane, and only frailty left; Himselfe, of all, besides himselfe, berest: 6 Like when some great Colossus, whose strong base Or mightie props are shrunk or sunke away, Fore-shewing ruine, threatning all the place That in the danger of his fall doth stay, All straight to better safetie flocke apace; None rest to helpe the ruine, while they may. “The perill great, and doubtfull the redresse, “Men are content to leaue Right in distresse. 7 And looke, how Thames, inricht with many a Flood, And goodly Riuers (that haue made their Graues, And buried both their names and all their good Within his greatnes, to augment his waues) Glides on, with pompe of Waters, vnwithstood, Vnto the Ocean (which his tribute craues) And layes vp all his wealth, within that powre, Which in it selfe all greatnes doth deuowre: 8 So flocke the mighty, with their following traine, Vnto the all-receiuing Bullingbrooke: Who wonders at himselfe, how hee should gaine So many harts as now his partie tooke; And with what ease, and with how slender paine, His fortune giues him more then he could looke: What he imagind neuer could be wrought Is powrd vpon him, farre beyond his thought. 9 So, often, things which seeme at first in showe, Without the compasse of accomplishment, Once vent'red on, to that successe do growe, That euen the Authors do admire th'euent; So many meanes which they did neuer knowe Do second their designes, and do present Straunge vnexpected helps, and chiefly then When th'Actors are reputed worthy men. 10 And Richard, who lookt Fortune in the backe, Sees headlong-lightness running from the right, Amazed standes to note how great a wracke Of faith, his riots caus'd, what mortall spight They beare him, who did law and iustice lacke; Sees how concealed hate breakes out in sight, And feare-depressed enuie (pent before) When fit occasion thus vnlockt the dore. 11 Like when some mastiue whelpe, dispos'd to play, A whole confused heard of beastes doth chace, Which with one vile consent run all away; If any hardier then the rest in place But offer head, that idle feare to stay, Backe straight the daunted chaser turnes his face, And all the rest (with bold example led) As fast run on him, as before they fled: 12 So, with this bold opposer, rushes-on This many-headed monster, Multitude: And he, who late was feard, is set vpon, And by his owne (Actæon-like) pursu'd; His owne, that had all loue and awe forgone: Whom breath and shadowes onely did delude, And newer hopes, which promises perswade; Though rarely men keepe promises so made. 13 Which when he saw; thus to himselfe complaines: “O why do you, fond, false-deceiued, so “Run headlong to that change that nothing gaines, “But gaine of sorrow, onely change of wo? “Which is all one, if he be like who raignes: “Why will you buy, with blood, what you forgoe? “Tis nought, but shewes, that Ignorance esteemes: “The thing possest is not the thing it seemes. 14 “And when the sinnes of Bullingbrooke shall be “As great as mine, and you vnanswered “In these your hopes; then may you wish for me “Your lawfull Sov'raigne, from whose faith you fled; “And, grieued in your soules, the error see “That shining promises had shadowed: “As th'humorous sicke, remouing, finde no ease, “When changed Chambers change not the disease. 15 “Then shall you finde this name of Libertie “(The watch-word of Rebellion euer vs'd; “The idle eccho of Vncertaintie, “That euermore the simple hath abus'd) “But new-turnd Seruitude and Miserie; “And euen the same and worse, before refus'd. “Th'aspirer once attaind vnto the top, “Cuts off those meanes by which himselfe got vp. 16 “And with a harder hand, and streighter raine, “Doth curbe that loosenes he did finde before; “Doubting th'occasion like might serue againe, “His owne example makes him feare the more. “Then, ô iniurious Land, what dost thou gaine “To aggrauate thine owne afflictions store? “Since thou must needs obay Kings gouernement; “And no rule, euer yet, could all content. 17 “What if my youth hath offered vp to lust “Licentious fruites of indiscreet desires, “When idle heate of vainer yeeres did thrust “That furie on: yet now when it retires “To calmer state, why should you so distrust “To reape that good whereto mine age aspires? “The youth of Princes haue no boundes for sinne, “Vnlesse themselues do make them boundes within. 18 “Who sees not, that sees ought (wo worth the while) “The easie way, that Greatnesse hath to fall? “Enuirond with deceit, hemm'd-in with guile, “Sooth'd vp in flatterie, fawned on of all: “Within his owne, liuing as in exile; “Heares but with others eares, or not at all: “And euen is made a prey vnto a fewe, “Who locke vp grace that would to other shewe: 19 “And who (as let in lease) do farme the Crowne, “And ioy the vse of Maiestie and might; “Whil'st we hold but the shadow of our owne, “Pleas'd with vaine shewes, and dallied with delight: “They, as huge vnproportion'd mountaines, growne “Betweene our land and vs, shadowing our light, “Bereaue the rest of ioy, and vs of loue, “And keepe downe all, to keepe themselues aboue. 20 “Which wounds, with griefe, poore vnrespected zeale, “When grace holdes no proportion in the parts; “When distribution, in the Common-weale, “Of charge and honour due to good desarts “Is stopt; when others greedie hands must deale “The benefite that Maiestie imparts: “What good we meant, comes gleaned home but light, “Whilst we are robd of prayse, they of their right. 21 Thus he complaind; when, lo, from Lancaster (The new intit'led Duke) with order sent Arriv'd Northumberland, as to conferre And make relation of the Dukes intent: And offred there, if that he would referre The controuersie vnto Parlement, And punish those that had abus'd the State, As causers of this vniuersall hate; 22 And also see that Iustice might be had On those the Duke of Glosters death procur'd, And such remov'd from Councell as were bad; His cosin Henry would, he there assur'd, On humble knees before his Grace be glad To aske him pardon, to be well secur'd, And haue his right and grace resto'rd againe: The which was all he labour'd to obtaine. 23 And therefore doth an enterparle exhort, Perswades him leaue that vnbeseeming place, And with a princely hardinesse resort Vnto his people, that attend his Grace: They meant his publique good, and not his hurt; And would most ioyfull be to see his face: He layes his soule to pledge, and takes his Oath, The ost of Christ, an ostage for his troth. 24 This proffer, with such protestations, made Vnto a King that so neere danger stood, Was a sufficient motiue to perswade, When no way else could shew a face so good: Th'vnhonourable meanes of safety, bade Danger accept, what Maiesty withstood. “When better choyses are not to be had, “We needes must take the seeming best of bad. 25 Yet standes he in doubt, a while, what way to take Conferring with that small remaining troope Fortune had left; which neuer would forsake Their poore distressed Lord, nor neuer stoope To any hopes the stronger part could make. Good Carlile, Ferby, and Sir Stephen Scroope, With that most worthy Montague, were all That were content with Maiesty to fall. 26 Time spare, and make not sacrilegious theft Vpon so memorable constancie: Let not succeeding Ages be bereft Of such examples of integritie: Nor thou magnanimous Leigh must not be left In darknesse, for thy rare fidelitie; To saue thy faith, content to lose thy head; That reuerent head, of good men honoured. 27 Nor will my Conscience I should iniury Thy memorie most trusty Ienico, For b'ing not ours; though wish that Gasconie Claym'd not, for hers, the faith we reuerence so; That England might haue this small companie Onely to her alone, hauing no moe: But le'ts diuide this good betwixt vs both, Take she thy birth, and we will haue thy troth. 28 “Graue Montague, whom long experience taught “In either fortune, thus aduis'd his King: “Deare Sou'raigne know, the matter that is sought, “Is onely now your Maiesty to bring “(From out of this poore safetie you haue got) “Into theyr hands, that else hold euery thing: “For, now, but onely you they want, of all; “And wanting you, they nothing theirs can call. 29 “Here haue you craggie Rocks to take your part; “That neuer will betray their faith to you: “These trusty Mountaines here will neuer start, “But stand t'vpbraid their shame that are vntrue. “Here may you fence your safetie with small art, “Against the pride of that confused Crew: “If men will not, these verie Cliffes will fight, “And be sufficient to defend your right. 30 “Then keepe you here, and here shall you behold, “Within short space, the slyding faith of those “That cannot long their resolution hold, “Repent the course their idle rashnesse chose: “For, that same mercenarie faith (they sold) “With least occasions discontented growes, “And insolent those voluntarie bands; “Presuming how, by them, he chiefly stands. 31 “And how can he those mightie troupes sustaine “Long time, where now he is, or any where? “Besides, what discipline can he retaine “Whereas he dares not keepe them vnder feare, “For feare to haue them to reuolt againe? “So that it selfe when Greatnesse cannot beare, “With her owne waight, must needes confus'dly fall, “Without the helpe of other force at all. 32 “And hither to approche hee will not dare; “Where deserts, rockes, and hilles, no succours giue; “Where desolation, and no comforts are; “Where few can do no good, many not liue. “Besides, we haue the Ocean to prepare “Some other place, if this should not relieue: “So shall you tire his force, consume his strength, “And weary all his followers, out, at length. 33 “Doe but referre to time, and to small time; “And infinite occasions you shall finde “To quaile the Rebell, euen in the prime “Of all his hopes, beyond all thought of minde: “For, many (with the conscience of the crime) “In colder blood will curse what they design'd: “And bad successe, vpbrayding their ill fact, “Drawes them, whom others draw, from such an act. 34 “For, if the least imagin'd ouerture “But of conceiv'd reuolt men once espie; “Straight shrinke the weake, the great will not indure, “Th'impatient run, the discontented flie: “The friend his friends example doth procure, “And all togither haste them presently “Some to their home, some hide: others, that stay, “To reconcile themselues, the rest betray. 35 “What hope haue you, that euer Bullingbrooke “Will liue a Subiect, that hath tri'd his fate? “Or what good reconcilement can you looke, “Where he must alwayes feare, and you must hate? “And neuer thinke that he this quarrell tooke “To reobtaine thereby his priuate state. “T'was greater hopes, that hereto did him call: “And he will thrust for all, or else lose all. 36 “Nor trust this suttle Agent, nor his oth. “You knowe his faith: you tri'd it before hand. “His fault is death: and now to lose his troth, “To saue his life, he will not greatly stand. “Nor trust your kinsmans proffer; since you, both “Shew, blood in Princes is no stedfast band. “What though he hath no title? he hath might: “That makes a title, where there is no right. 37 Thus he: when that good Bishop thus replies, Out of a minde that quiet did affect: “My Lord, I must confesse, as your case lies, “You haue great cause your Subiects to suspect, “And counterplot against their subtelties, “Who all good care and honestie neglect; “And feare the worst what insolence may do, “Or armed fury may incense them to. 38 “But yet, my Lord, feare may aswell transport “Your care, beyond the truth of what is meant; “As otherwise neglect may fall too short, “In not examining of their intent: “But, let vs weigh the thing which they exhort. “Tis Peace, Submission, and a Parlement: “Which, how expedient 'tis for either part, “Twere good we iudg'd with an vnpartiall hart. 39 “And first, for you my Lord, in griefe we see “The miserable case wherein you stand; “Voyde here of succour, helpe, or maiestie, “On this poore promontorie of your Land: “And where how long a time your Grace may be “(Expecting what may fall into your hand) “Wee know not; since th'euent of things do lie “Clos'd vp in darkenes, farre from mortall eye. 40 “And how vnfit it were, you should protract “Long time, in this so dangerous disgrace? “As though that you good spirit and courage lackt “To issue out of this opprobrious place: “When euen the face of Kings do oft exact “Feare and remorse in faultie subiects base; “And longer stay a great presumption drawes “That you were guilty, or did doubt your cause. 41 “What Subiects euer so inrag'd would dare “To violate a Prince, t'offend the blood “Of that renowmed race, by which they are “Exalted to the height of all their good? “What if some things by chaunce misguided were, “Which they haue now rebelliously withstood? “They neuer will proceed with that despight “To wracke the State, and to confound the right, 42 “Nor doe I think that Bullingbrooke can bee “So blind-ambitious, to affect the Crowne; “Hauing himselfe no title, and doth see “Others, if you should fayle, must keepe him downe. “Besides, the Realme, though mad, will neuer gree “To haue a right succession ouerthrowne; “To rayse confusion vpon them and theirs, “By preiudicing true and lawfull heires. 43 “And now it may be, fearing the successe ‘Of his attemptes, or with remorse of minde, “Or else distrusting secret practises, “He would be glad his quarrell were resign'd; “So that there were some orderly redresse “In those disorders which the Realme did finde: “And this, I thinke, he now sees were his best; “Since farther actions further but vnrest. 44 “And, for th'impossibilitie of peace “And reconcilement, which my Lord obiects; “I thinke, when doing iniurie shall cease “(The cause pretended) then surcease th'effects: “Time and some other Actions may increase “As may diuert the thought of these respects; “Others law of forgetting iniuries “May serue our turne in like calamities. 45 “And for his oath, in conscience, and in sense, “True honour would not so be found vntrue, “Nor spot his blood with such a foule offence “Against his soule, against his God, and you. “Our Lord forbid, that ever with th'expence “Of heauen and heauenly ioyes, that shall insue, “Mortalitie should buy this little breath, “T'indure the horror of eternall death. 46 “And therefore, as I thinke, you safely may “Accept this proffer; that determine shall “All doubtfull courses by a quiet way, “Needfull for you, fit for them, good for all. “And here, my Sov'raigne, to make longer stay “T'attend for what you are vnsure will fall, “May slippe th'occasion, and incense their will: “For, Feare, that's wiser then the truth, doth ill. 47 Thus he perswades, out of a zealous minde; Supposing, men had spoken as they ment: And, vnto this, the King likewise inclin'd: As wholly vnto peace, and quiet bent: And yeeldes himselfe to th'Earle, goes, leaues-behind His safetie, Scepter, Honor, Gouernement: For, gone, all's gone: he is no more his owne; And they rid quite of feare, he of the Crowne. 48 A place there is, where proudly rais'd there stands A huge aspiring Rock, neighb'ring the Skies; Whose surly brow imperiously commaunds The Sea his boundes, that at his proud feete lies: And spurnes the waues, that in rebellious bands Assault his Empire, and against him rise: Vnder whose craggy gouernment, there was A niggard narrow way for men to passe. 49 And here, in hidden cliffes, concealed lay A troope of armed men, to intercept The vnsuspecting King, that had no way To free his foote, that into danger stept. The dreadfull Ocean, on the one side, lay: The hard-incroching Mountaine th'other kept: Before him, he beheld his hateful foes: Behind him, trayterous enemies inclose. 50 Enuiron'd thus, the Earle begins to cheere His al-amased Lord, by him betrayde; Bids him take courage, ther's no cause of feare, These troopes, but there to guard him safe, were layd. To whom the King; What neede so many here? This is against your oath, my Lord, he said. But, now hee sees in what distresse he stood: To striue, was vaine; t'intreat, would do no good. 51 And therefore on with careful hart he goes; Complaines (but, to himselfe) sighes, grieues, and freats; At Rutland dines, though feedes but on his woes: The griefe of minde hindred the minde of meats. For, sorrow, shame, and feare, scorne of his foes, The thought of what he was, and what now threats, Then what he should, and now what he hath done, Musters confused passions all in one. 52 To Flint, from thence, vnto a restless bed, That miserable night, he comes conuayd; Poorely prouided, poorely followed, Vncourted, vnrespected, vnobayd: Where, if vncertaine sleepe but hoouered Ouer the drooping cares that heauy weigh'd; Millions of figures, fantasie presents Vnto that sorrow, wakened griefe augments. 53 His new misfortune makes deluding sleepe Say 'twas not so (False dreames the trueth denie). Wherewith he starts; feels waking cares do creepe Vpon his soule, and giues his dreame the lie; Then sleepes againe: and then againe, as deepe Deceites of darknes mocke his miserie. So hard believ'd was sorrow in her youth: That he thinks truth was dreams, &amp; dreams were truth. 54 The morning light presents vnto his view (Walking vpon a turret of the place) The trueth of what hee sees is prov'd too true; A hundred thousand men, before his face, Came marching on the shore, which thither drew: And, more to aggrauate his great disgrace, Those he had wronged, or done to them despight, (As if they him vpbrayd) came first in sight. 55 There might hee see that false forsworne vile crue, Those shameless agents of vnlawfull lust, His Pandars, Parasites (people vntrue To God and man, vnworthy any trust) Preacing vnto that fortune that was new, And with vnblushing faces formost thrust; As those that still with prosperous fortune sort, And are as borne for Corte, or made in Cort. 56 There hee beheld, how humbly diligent New Adulation was to be at hand; How ready Falsehood stept; how nimbly went Base pick-thank Flattery, and preuents Command: Hee saw the great obay, the graue consent, And all with this new-rays'd Aspirer stand; But, which was worst, his owne part acted there, Not by himselfe; his powre, not his, appeare. 57 Which whilst he view'd, the Duke he might perceiue Make towards the Castle, to an interview. Wherefore he did his contemplation leaue, And downe into some fitter place withdrew; Where now he must admitte, without his leaue, Him, who before with all submission due Would haue beene glad, t'attend, and to prepare The grace of audience, with respectiue care. 58 Who now being come in presence of his king (Whether the sight of Maiestie did breed Remorse of what he was incompassing, Or whether but to formalize his deed) He kneeles him downe with some astonishing, Rose; kneeles againe: (for, craft wil still exceed) When-as the king approch't, put off his Hood, And welcomd him, though wisht him little good. 59 “To whom, the Duke began: My Lord, I knowe “That both vncall'd, and vnexpected too, “I haue presumed in this sort to showe “And seeke the right which I am borne vnto: “Yet pardon I beseech you, and allow “Of that constraint, which driues me thus to doo. “For, since I could not by a fairer course “Attaine mine owne, I must vse this of force. 60 “Well: so it seemes, deare Cosin, said the King; “Though you might haue procur'd it otherwise: “And I am here content, in euery thing “To right you, as your selfe shal best deuise: “And God voutsafe, the force that here you bring “Beget not England greater iniuries. And so they part: the Duke made haste from thence: It was no place to ende this difference. 61 Straight towards London, in this heate of pride, They forward set; as they had fore-decreed: With whom, the Captiue King constraind must ride, Most meanely mounted on a simple Steed: Degraded of all grace and ease beside, Thereby neglect of all respect to breed. For, th'ouer-spreading pompe of prouder might Must darken vveaknes, and debase his sight. 62 Approaching neere the Cittie, hee was met With all the sumptuous shewes ioy could deuise: Where new-desire to please did not forget To passe the vsuall pompe of former guise. Striuing Applause, as out of prison let, Runnes-on, beyond all bounds, to nouelties: And voyce, and hands, and knees, and all do now A strange deformed forme of welcome showe. 63 And manifold Confusion running greetes, Shoutes, cries, claps hands, thrusts, striues and presses neere: Houses impov'risht were, t'inrich the streetes, And streetes left naked, that (vnhappie) were Plac't from the sight where Joy with Wonder meetes; Where all, of all degrees, striue to appeare; Where diuers-speaking Zeale one murmure findes, In vndistinguisht voyce to tell their mindes. 64 He that in glorie of his fortune sate, Admiring what hee thought could neuer be, Did feele his blood within salute his state, And lift vp his reioycing soule, to see So many hands and hearts congratulate Th'aduancement of his long-desir'd degree; When, prodigall of thankes, in passing by, He resalutes them all, with chearefull eye. 65 Behind him, all aloofe, came pensiue on The vnregarded King; that drooping went Alone, and (but for spight) scarce lookt vpon: Iudge, if hee did more enuie, or lament. See what a wondrous worke this day is done; Which th'image of both fortunes doth present: In th'one, to shew the best of glories face; In th'other, worse then worst of all disgrace. 66 Novv Isabell, the young afflicted Queene (Whose yeares had neuer shew'd her but delights, Nor louely eyes before had euer seene Other then smiling ioyes, and ioyfull sights; Borne great, matcht great, liv'd great, and euer beene Partaker of the worlds best benefits) Had plac't her selfe, hearing her Lord should passe That way, where she vnseene in secret was; 68 Sicke of delay, and longing to behold Her long-mist Loue in fearefull ieoperdies: To whom, although it had, in sort, beene told Of their proceeding, and of his surprize; Yet thinking they would neuer be so bold To lead their Lord in any shamefull wise, But rather would conduct him as their King; As seeking but the States reordering. 69 And foorth shee lookes, and notes the formost traine; And grieues to view some there she wisht not there: Seeing the chiefe not come, stayes, lookes againe; And yet she sees not him that should appeare: Then backe she stands, and then desires as faine Againe to looke, to see if hee were neere: At length a glittering troupe farre off she spies, Perceiues the throng, and heares the shouts and cries. 70 Lo, yonder now at length he comes, sayth shee: Looke, my goode women, where he is in sight: Do you not see him? yonder, that is hee, Mounted on that white Courser, all in white, There where the thronging troupes of people bee; I know him by his seate, he sits s'vpright: Lo, now he bowes: deare Lord, with what sweet grace! How long, haue I longd to behold that face! 71 O what delight my hart takes by mine eye! I doubt me, when he comes but something neere, I shall set wide the window: what care I Who doth see me, so him I may see cleare? Thus doth false ioy delude her wrongfully (Sweete Lady) in the thing she held so deare. For, neerer come, she findes she had mistooke; And him she markt, was Henrie Bullingbrooke. 72 Then Enuie takes the place in her sweet eyes, Where Sorrow had prepar'd her selfe a seat: And words of wrath, from whence complaints should rise, Proceed from egre lookes, and browes that threat: Traytor, saith shee; ist thou, that in this wise To braue thy Lord and King, art made so great? And haue mine eyes done vnto me this wrong, To looke on thee? for this, staid I so long? 73 Ah, haue they grac't a periur'd Rebell so? Well; for their errour I will weepe them out, And hate the tongue defil'd, that praysde my foe, And loath the minde, that gaue me not to doubt: What? haue I added shame vnto my woe? Ile looke no more: Ladies, looke you about, And tell me if my Lord be in this traine; Least my betraying eyes should erre againe. 74 And in this passion turnes her selfe away: The rest looke all, and carefull note each wight; Whil'st she, impatient of the least delay, Demaundes againe; And what, not yet in sight? Where is my Lord? What, gone some other way? I muse at this. O God, graunt all goe right: Then to the window goes againe at last, And sees the chiefest traine of all was past; 75 And sees not him her soule desir'd to see: And yet hope, spent, makes her not leaue to looke. At last, her loue-quicke eyes, which ready be, Fastens on one; whom though she neuer tooke Could be her Lord; yet that sad cheere which hee Then shew'd, his habit and his woful looke, The grace he doth in base attire retaine, Caus'd her she could not from his sight refraine. 76 What might he be, she said, that thus alone Rides pensiue in this vniuersall ioy? Some I perceiue, as well as we, do mone: All are not pleas'd with euery thing this day. It may be, hee laments the wrong is done Vnto my Lord, and grieues; as well he may. Then he is some of ours: and we, of right, Must pittie him, that pitties our sad plight. 77 But stay: ist not my Lord himselfe I see? In truth, if 'twere not for his base aray, I verily should thinke that it were hee; And yet his basenes doth a grace bewray: Yet God forbid; let me deceiued be, And be it not my Lord, although it may: Let my desire make vowes against desire; And let my sight approue my sight a lier. 78 Let me not see him, but himselfe; a King: For so he left me; so he did remoue. This is not he: this feeles some other thing; A passion of dislike, or else of loue. O yes; 'tis he: that princely face doth bring The euidence of Maiestie to prooue: That face, I haue conferr'd, which now I see, With that within my heart, and they agree. 79 Thus as she stood assur'd, and yet in doubt; Wishing to see, what seene she griev'd to see; Hauing beliefe, yet faine would be without; Knowing, yet striuing not to know 'twas hee: Her heart relenting, yet her heart so stout As would not yeeld to thinke what was, could be: Till, quite condemn'd by open proofe of sight, Shee must confesse; or else denie the light. 80 For, whether loue in him did sympathize, Or chaunce so wrought, to manifest her doubt; Euen iust before, where she thus secret pries, He stayes, and with cleare face lookes all about; When she: Tis, ô, too true; I know his eyes: Alas, it is my owne deare Lord cries out: And, with that crie, sinks downe vpon the flore: Abundant griefe lackt words to vtter more. 81 Sorrow keepes full possession in her heart, Lockes it within, stops vp the way of breath, Shuts senses out of doore from euerie part; And so long holdes there, as it hazardeth Oppressed Nature, and is forc't to part, Or else must be constrain'd to stay with death: So, by a sigh, it lets in sense againe; And sense, at length, giues words leaue to complaine. 82 Then, like a torrent had beene stopt before, Teares, sighes, and words, doubled togither flowe; Confus'dly striuing whether should do more, The true intelligence of griefe to showe. Sighes hindred words: words perisht in their store: Both, intermixt in one, together growe. One would do all: the other, more then's part; Being both sent equall Agents, from the hart. 83 At length, when past the first of sorrowes worst, When calm'd confusion better forme affordes; Her heart commands, her words should passe out first, And then her sighes should interpoint her words; The whiles her eyes out into teares should burst: This order with her sorrow she accordes; Which, orderless, all forme of order brake: So, then began her wordes, and thus she spake; 84 What? dost thou thus returne againe to mee? Are these the triumphs, for thy victories? Is this the glorie thou dost bring with thee, From that vnhappie Irish enterprise? And haue I made so many vowes to see Thy safe returne, and see thee in this wise? Is this the lookt-for comfort thou dost bring? To come a Captiue, that wentst out a King? 85 And yet, deare Lord, though thy vngratefull Land Hath left thee thus; yet I will take thy part: I doo remaine the same, vnder thy hand; Thou still dost rule the kingdome of my hart: If all be lost, that gouernment doth stand; And that shall neuer from thy rule depart: And so thou bee, I care not how thou bee: Let Greatnes goe; so it goe without thee. 86 And welcome come, how-so vnfortunate; I will applaud what others do despise: I loue thee for thy selfe, not for thy State: More then thy selfe, is what without thee, lies: Let that more goe, if it be in thy fate: And hauing but thy selfe, it will suffize: I married was not to thy Crowne, but thee; And thou, without a Crowne, all one to mee. 87 But what do I, heere lurking idlie, mone And wayle apart, and in a single part Make seuerall griefe; which should be both in one; The touch being equall of each others hart. Ah, no: sweet Lord, thou must not mone alone. For, without me, thou art not all thou art; Nor my teares, without thine, are fully teares: For thus vnioyn'd, sorrow but halfe appeares. 88 Ioyne then our plaints, and make our griefe full griefe: Our state being one, let vs not part our care. Sorrow hath onely this poore bare reliefe, To be bemon'd of such as wofull are. And should I rob thy griefe, and be the thiefe To steale a priuate part, and seuerall share, Defrawding sorrow of her perfect due? No, no, my Lord; I come to helpe thee rue. 89 Then foorth she goes, a close concealed way (As grieuing to be seene not as she was); Labors t'attaine his presence all she may: Which, with most hard a-do, was brought to passe. For, that night, vnderstanding where he lay, With earnest 'treating she procur'd her Passe To come to him: Rigor could not denie Those teares, so poore a suite, or put her by. 90 Entring the chamber, where he was alone (As one whose former fortune was his shame) Loathing th'vpbrayding eye of any one That knew him once, and knowes him not the same: When hauing giuen expresse command that none Should presse to him; yet hearing some that came Turnes angerly about his grieued eyes: When, lo, his sweete afflicted Queene he spyes. 91 Straight cleares his brow; and with a borrowed smile, What, my deare Queene? welcome, my deare, he sayes: And (striuing his owne passion to beguile, And hide the sorrow which his eye betrayes) Could speake no more; but wrings her hands, the while: And then, Sweet Lady; and againe he stayes: Th'excesse of ioy and sorrow both affordes Affliction none, or but poore niggard wordes. 92 Shee that was come with a resolved hart, And with a mouth full stor'd, with wordes well chose; Thinking, This comfort wil I first impart Vnto my Lord, and thus my speach dispose: Then thus Ile say, thus looke, and with this art Hide mine owne sorrow to relieue his woes; When being come, all this prov'd nought but winde; Teares, lookes, and sighes, do only tell her minde. 93 Thus both stood silent and confused so, Their eyes relating how their hearts did morne: Both bigge with sorrow, and both great with wo In labour with what was not to be borne: This mightie burthen, wherewithall they goe, Dies vndeliuered, perishes vnborne; Sorrow makes silence her best Orator, Where words may make it lesse, not shew it more. 94 But he, whom longer time had learn'd the art T'indure affliction, as a vsuall touch; Straines foorth his wordes, and throwes dismay apart, To rayse vp her, whose passions now were such As quite opprest her ouercharged hart (Too small a vessell to containe so much) And cheeres and mones, and fained hopes doth frame, As if himselfe beleeu'd, or hop't the same. 95 And now, the while these Princes sorrowed, Forward Ambition (come so neere her ende) Sleepes not, nor slippes th'occasion offered, T'accomplish what it did before intend: A Parlement is foorthwith summoned In Richards name; whereby they might pretend A forme, to grace disorder, and a showe Of holy right, the right to ouerthrowe. 96 Order, how much predominant art thou! That if but onely thou pretended art; How soone, deceiv'd mortalitie doth bow To follow thine, as still the better part! Tis thought, that reuerent Forme will not allow Iniquitie, or sacred right peruart. Within our soules, since then thou dwell'st so strong; How ill do they, that vse thee, to do wrong! 97 So ill did they, that in this formall course Sought to establish a deformed right: Who might as well effected it by force; But that men hold it wrong, what's wrought by might. Offences vrg'd in publique are made worse: The shew of iustice aggrauates despight. “The multitude, that looke not to the cause, “Rest satisfied, so it seeme done by lawes. 98 And now they diuerse articles obiect Of rigor, malice, priuate fauourings, Exaction, riot, falsehood, and neglect; Crimes done, but sildome answered by Kings: Which Subiectes doe lament, but not correct. And all these faults, which Lancaster now brings Against a King, must be his owne, when hee, By vrging others sinnes, a King shall be. 99 For, all that was most odious was deuis'd, And publisht in these articles abrode. All th'errours of his youth were here compris'd, Calamitie with obloquie to lode: And more to make him publikely despis'd, Libels, inuectiues, rayling rimes, were sow'd Among the vulgar, to prepare his fall With more applause and good consent of all. 100 Looke how the day-hater, Mineruas bird, Whil'st priuiledg'd with darknes and the night, Doth liue secure t'himselfe, of others feard; If but by chaunce discouered in the light, How doth each little Fowle (with enuie stirr'd) Call him to iustice, vrge him with despight; Summon the feathered flockes of all the wood, To come to scorne the tyrant of their blood: 101 So fares this King, lay'd open to disgrace, Whil'st euerie mouth full of reproche inuayes; And euerie base detractor, in this case, Vpon th'aduantage of misfortune playes: Downe-falling Greatnes, vrged on apace, Was followed-hard, by all disgracefull wayes; Now in the point t'accelerate an end, Whil'st miserie had no meanes to defend. 102 Vpon those articles in Parlement So haynous made, inforc't, and vrg'd so hard, He was adiudg'd vnfit for gouernment, And of all regal powre and rule debarr'd: For, who durst contradict the Dukes intent? Or, if they durst, should patiently be heard? Desire of change, old wrongs, new hopes, fresh feare, Being far the maior part, the cause must beare. 103 Yet must we thinke, that some which saw the course (The better fewe, whom passion made not blinde) Stood careful lookers-on, with sad commorse, Amaz'd to see what headlong rage design'd: And, in a more considerate discourse Of tragicall euentes, thereof diuin'd; And would excuse and pittie those defects, Which, with such hate, the aduerse parte obiects: 104 “Saying, better yeeres might worke a better care, “And time might well haue cur'd what was amisse; “Since all these faults fatall to Greatnes are, “And worse deserts haue not beene punisht thus: “But yet in this, the heauens, we feare, prepare “Confusion for our sinnes, aswell as his; “And his calamitie beginneth our: “For, he his owne, and we abus'd his powre. 105 Thus murmur'd they; when to the king were sent Certaine who might perswade him to forsake And leaue his Crowne, and with his free consent A voluntarie Resignation make; Since that he could no other way preuent These dangers which he else must needes partake: For, not to yeeld, to what feare would constraine, Would barre the hope of life, that did remaine. 106 And yet this scarce could worke him to consent To yeeld vp that so soone, men hold so deare. Why, let him take (sayd he) the gouernement, And let me yet the name, the title beare: Leaue me that shewe, and I wil be content; And let them rule and gouerne without feare. What, can they not my shadow now indure, When they of all the rest do stand secure? 107 Let me hold that, I aske no other good: Nay, that I will hold; Henrie do thy worst, For, ere I yeeld my Crowne, I'le lose my blood; That blood, that shall make thee and thine accurst. Thus resolute a while he firmly stood, Till loue of life, and feare of being forc't, Vanquisht th'innated valour of his minde; And hope, and friends, so wrought, that he resign'd. 108 Then to the Towre (where he remained) went The Duke, with all the Peeres in company, To take his offer with his free consent, And this his Resignation testifie; And thereof to informe the Parlement, That all things might be done more formally, And men thereby rest better satisfide; As of an act not forc't, or falsifide. 109 And forth h'is brought vnto th'accomplishment, Deckt with the Crowne in princely robes that day; Like as the dead, in other Landes are sent Vnto their Graues, in all their best aray: And euen like good, did him this ornament. For, what he brought, he must not beare away; But buries there his glory and his name, Intomb'd both in his owne and others blame. 110 And there vnto th'assembly of these States, His sorrow for their long indured wrong Through his abus'd authority relates, Excuses wish confessions mixt among: And glad he sayes, to finish all debates, He was to leaue the Rule they sought-for long; Protesting, if it might be for their good, He would as gladly sacrifice his blood. 111 There, he his Subiectes all (in generall) Assoyles and quites of oath and fealtie, Renounces interest, title, right and all That appertaind to kingly dignitie; Subscribes thereto, and doth to witnesse call Both heauen and earth, and God, &amp; Saints on hie, To testifie his act, and doth professe To do the same with most free willingnesse. 112 Tis said, with his owne hands he gaue the Crowne To Lancaster, and wisht to God he might Haue better ioy thereof then he had knowne, And that his power might make it his by right: And furthermore he crav'd, of all his owne, But life, to liue apart a priuate wight; The vanity of Greatnes he had tri'd, And how vnsurely standes the foote of pride. 113 This brought to passe, the Lords returne with speed, The Parlement hereof to certifie; Where, they at large publisht the Kings owne deed, And forme of his resignement verbally: And thereupon doth Lancaster proceede To make his claime vnto the Monarchie; And shewes the right he hath, both by descent, And by recouerie, to the gouernement. 114 Which being granted, Canterburie rose And animates them, by the sacred word, “In this their course: and by his Text, he showes “How well they made their choyce of such a Lord; “Who, as a man was able to dispose “And guide the State: and how the royall sworde “Ought to be at a mans commandement; “Not at a childes, or one as impotent. 115 “Since, when the greatnes of his charge exceedes “The smallnesse of his powers, he must collate “The same on others: whence, sayes he, proceedes “This rauenous expilation of the State; “Whence no man any more the publike heedes, “Then so much as imports his priuate state. “Our Health is from our head: if that be ill, “Distemp'red, faint, and weake, all the rest will. 116 “Then to the present, all his speach he drawes, “And shewes what admirable parts abound “In this braue Prince; being fit to giue them lawes, “Fit for his valour, fit for iudgement sound. And Lancaster, indeed I would thy cause Had had as lawfull and as sure a ground, As had thy vertues, and thy noble hart, Ordaind, and borne for an Imperial part. 117 Then had not that confus'd succeeding Age Our fieldes ingrayn'd with bloud, our riuers dy'd With purple-streaming woundes of our owne rage, Nor seene our Princes slaughtred, Peeres destroyd. Then hadst not thou, deare Countrie, com'n to vvage Warre vvith thy selfe, nor those afflictions try'd Of all consuming discorde here so long; Too mightie novv, against thy selfe too strong. The ende of the second Booke. [[THE THIRD BOOKE.]] THE ARGVMENT OF THE THIRD BOOKE. Henrie, the fourth, the Crowne established. The Lords, that did to Glosters death consent, Degraded, do rebell, are vanquished. King Richard, vnto Pomfret Castle sent, Is by a cruell Knight there murthered, After the Lords had had their punishment. His Corps, from thence, to London is conuayd; And there, for all to view, is open layd. 1 Now risen is that Head, by which did spring The birth of two strong Heads, two Crownes, two rights; That monstrous shape, that afterward did bring Deform'd confusion to distracted wights. Now is attain'd that dearely purchast thing That fill'd the world with lamentable sights: And now, attain'd, all care is how to frame Meanes to establish, and to hold the same. 2 First, he attends to build a strong conceipt Of his vsurped powre, in peoples mindes; And armes his cause with furniture of weight: Which easily the sword, and Greatnesse findes. Succession, Conquest, and election straight Suggested are, and prov'd in all their kindes. More then ynough they finde, who finde their might Hath force to make all, that they will haue, Right. 3 Though one of these might verie well suffise His present approbation to procure. “But who his own cause makes, doth stil deuise “To make too much, to haue it more then sure. “Feare casts too deepe, and euer is too wise: “No vsuall plots, the doubtfull can secure. And all these disagreeing Claymes he had, With hope to make one good of many bad. 4 Like vnto him that fears, and faine would stop An inundation working-on apace, Runs to the Breach, heapes mightie matter vp, Throwes indigested burthens on the place, Lodes with huge weights, the out-side, &amp; the top, But leaues the inner partes in feeble case; Whil'st th'vnder-searching water, working-on, Beares (proudly) downe, all that was idly don: 5 So fares it with our indirect desseignes, And wrong contriued labors, at the last; Whil'st working Time, and iustice vndermines The feeble frame, held to be wrought so fast: Then when out-breaking vengeance vncombines The ill-ioyn'd plots so fayrely ouer-cast; Turnes vp those huge pretended heapes of showes, And all these weake illusions ouer-throwes. 6 But, after, hauing made his title plaine, Vnto his Coronation he proceedes: Which, in most sumptuous sort (to intertaine The gazing vulgar, whom this splendor feeds) Is stately furnisht, with a glorious traine: Wherein, the former Kings he far exceedes; And all t'amuse the world, and turne the thought Of what &amp; how 'twas done, to what is wrought. 7 And that he might on many props repose, He strengths his owne, &amp; who his part did take: New Officers, new Councellors he chose: His eldest sonne, the Prince of Wales doth make; His second, Lord high Steward: and, to those Had hazarded their fortunes for his sake, He giues them charge, as merites their deseart; And rayses them, by crushing th'aduerse part. 8 So that hereby, the vniuersall face Of Court, with all the Offices of State Are wholly chang'd, by death, or by disgrace, Vpon th'aduantage of the peoples hate; “Who, euer enuying those of chiefest place “(Whom neither worth nor vertue, but their fate “Exalted hath) doo, when their Kings doo naught “(Because it's in their powre) iudge it their faute. 9 And in their steed, such as were popular, And wel-deseruing, were aduanc't by grace. Graue Shirley, he ordaines Lord Chancelor; Both worthy for his vertues, and his race: And Norburie hee appoints for Treasurer; A man, though meane, yet fit to vse that place: And others, t'other roomes; whom people hold So much more lov'd, how much they loath the old. 10 And it behoues him now to doo his best T'approue his vow, and oath made to the State: And many great disorders he redrest; Which alwayes Vsurpation makes the gate To let it selfe into the peoples brest, And seekes the publike best t'accommodate: Wherein, Iniustice better doth then Right: “For, who reproues the lame, must go vpright. 11 Though it be easie to accuse a State, Of imperfection and misgouernment: And easie to beget in people hate Of present Rule, which cannot all content; And fewe attempt it, that effect it not: Yet, t'introduce a better gouernment In steed thereof, if we t'example looke, The vnder-takers haue beene ouer-tooke. 12 Then, against those he strictly doth proceed, Who chiefe of Glosters death were guiltie thought; Not so much for the hatred of that deed: But, vnder this pretext, the meanes he sought To ruine such whose might did much exceed His powre to wrong, nor else could well be wrought. Law, Iustice, blood, the zeale vnto the dead, Were on his side, and his drift coloured. 13 Here, many of the greatest of the Land Accus'd were of the act, strong proofes brought out; Which strongly were refell'd: the Lords all stand, To cleare their Cause, most resolutely stout: The King, perceiuing what he tooke in hand Was not with safety to be brought-about, Desists to vrge their death, in any wise; Respecting number, strength, friends, and allies. 14 Nor was it time now, in his tender raigne, And infant-young-beginning gouernement, To striue, with blood; when lenitie must gaine The mightie men, and please the discontent. “New Kings do feare; when old Courts farther straine: Establisht States to all things will consent. He must dispense with his will, and their crime, And seeke t'oppresse and weare them out with time. 15 Yet not to seeme, but to haue something done, In what he could, not as he would effect; To satisfie the people (that begun, Reuenge of wrong and iustice to expect) He caus'd be put to execution, one, Who to performe this murther was elect; A base companion, few, or none would misse: Who first did serue their turne; and now serues his. 16 And, to abase the too high state of those That were accus'd, and lessen their degrees, Aumarle, Surry, Exceter, must lose The names of Dukes; their titles, dignities, And whatsoeuer honour with it goes; The Earles, their titles and their Signories: And all they got in th'end of Richards raigne, Since Glosters death, they must restore againe; 17 By this, as if by Ostracisme, t'abate That great presumptiue wealth, whereon they stand. For, first, hereby impov'rishing their state, He killes the meanes they might have to withstand: Then equals them with other whom they hate Who (by their spoyles) are raisd to hie command; That weake, and enuied, if they should conspire, They wracke themselues, and he hath his desire. 18 Yet, by this grace (which must be held a grace) As both they, and the world, are made beleeue, He thinks t'haue dealt benignly in this case, And left them state ynough, to let them liue; And that the taking, from th?, meanes &amp; place, Was nothing, in respect what hee did giue: But they, that knowe how their owne reckning goes, Account not what they haue, but what they lose. 19 The Parlement, which now is held, decreed What-euer pleas'd the King but to propound; Confirm'd the Crowne, to him, and to his seed, And by their oath their due obedience bound: Which was the powre that stood him best in steed, And made what-euer broken courses sound. For, what he got by fortune, fauour, might, It was the State that now must make his right. 20 Here was agreed, to make all more secure, That Richard should remaine, for euermore, Close-prisoner; least the Realme might chaunce indure Some new reuolt, or any fresh vp-rore: And, that if any should such broyle procure, By him, or for him, he should die therefore. So that a talke of tumult, and a breath, Would serue him as his passing bell to death. 21 Yet, reuerent Carlile, thou didst there oppose Thy holy voyce, to saue thy Princes blood; And freely checktst this iudgement, and his foes: When all were bad, yet thou dar'dst to be good. Be it inrold (that time may neuer lose The memorie) how firme thy courage stood; When powre, disgrace, nor death, could ought diuert Thy glorious tongue, thus, to reueale thy heart. 22 “Graue, reuerent Lords, since that this sacred place “Our Auentine-Retire, our holy hill “(This place, soule of our State, the Realmes best grace) “Doth priuiledge me speake what reason will: “Let me but say my conscience in this case; “Least sinne of silence shew my hart was ill: “And let these walles witnesse, if you will not, “I do discharge my soule, of this foule blot. 23 “Neuer shall this poore breath of mine consent, “That he that two and twentie yeeres hath raignd “As lawfull Lord, and King by iust descent, “Should here be iudg'd, vnheard, and vnarraignd; “By Subiects too (Iudges incompetent “To iudge their King vnlawfully detaind) “And vnbrought-foorth to plead his guiltless Cause; “Barring th'Annoynted, libertie of lawes. 24 “Haue you not done inough, with what is done? “Must needes disorder growe, from bad, to worse? “Can neuer mischiefe end as it begunne, “But being once out, must farther out, of force? “Thinke you, that any meanes, vnder the Sunne, “Can assecure so indirect a course? “Or any broken cunning build so strong, “As can hold out the hand of vengeance long? 25 Stopt, there, was his too vehement speech with speed, And he sent close to warde, from where he stood; His zeale vntimely, deem'd too much t'exceed The measure of his wit, and did no good. They resolute, for all this, do proceed Vnto that iudgement could not be withstood: The King had all he crav'd, or could compell: And all was done; let others iudge, how well. 26 Now Muse relate a wofull accident, And tell the blood-shed of these mightie Peeres, Who (lately reconcil'd) rest discontent, Griev'd with disgrace, remayning in their feares: How-euer seeming outwardly content; Yet th'inward touch, that wounded honor beares, Rests closely rankling, and can finde no ease, Till death of one side cure this great disease. 27 Meanes how to feele, and learne each others hart, By th'Abbots skill of Westminster is found: Who, secretly disliking Henries part, Inuites these Lords, and those hee meant to sound; Feasts them with cost, and drawes them on with art; And darke, and doubtfull questions doth propound: Then playner speakes; and yet vncertaine speakes: Then wishes well; then off abruptly breakes. 28 My Lords, saith he, I feare we shall not finde This long-desired King, such as was thought: But yet, he may do well: God turne his minde: Tis yet new dayes: but, Ill bodes new and nought: Some yet speed well: though all men of my kinde Haue cause to doubt; his speech is not forgot, That Princes had too little, we too much. God giue him grace: but 'tis ill trusting such. 29 This open-close, apparent-darke discourse Drew-on much speech: and euerie man replies: And euery man addes heate: and words inforce And vrge out wordes. For, when one man espies Anothers minde like his, then ill breedes worse; And out breaks all in th'end what closest lies. For, when men well haue fed, th'blood being warme, Then are they most improuident of harme. 30 Bewray they did their inward boyling spight; Each stirring other to reuenge their cause. One sayes he neuer should indure the sight Of that forsworne, that wrongs both Land and lawes; Another vowes the same; of his minde, right. A third t'a point more neere the matter drawes; Sweares, if they would, he would attempt the thing, To chace th'vsurper, and replace their King. 31 Thus one by one, kindling each others fire, Till all inflam'd, they all in one agree: All resolute to prosecute their ire, Seeking their owne, and Countries cause to free; And haue his first, that their blood did conspire. For, no way else, they sayd, but this, could be Their wrong-detained honor to redeeme: Which, true-bred blood should, more then life, esteeme. 32 And let not this our new-made faithless Lord, Sayth Surry, thinke, that we are lest so bare (Though bare inough) but we wil finde a sword To kill him with, when he shal not beware. For, he that is with life and will instor'd, Hath, for reuenge, inough, and needes not care: For, time brings meanes to furnish him withall: Let him but wayte occasions as they fall. 33 Then, of the manner how t'effect the thing, Consulted was: and in the ende agreed, That at a Maske, and common Reuelling, Which was ordain'd, they should performe the deed; For, that would be least doubted of the King, And fittest for their safetie to proceed: The night, their number, and the soddaine act, Would dash all order, and protect their fact. 34 Besides, they might vnder the faire pretence Of Tilts and Turnements, which they intend, Prouide them horse, and armour for defence, And all things else conuenient for their end: Besides, they might hold sure intelligence Among themselues, without suspect t'offend: The King would thinke, they sought but grace in Court, With all their great preparing in this sort. 35 A solemne oath religiously they take, By intermutuall vowes protesting there, This neuer to reueale; nor to forsake So good a Cause, for danger, hope, or feare: The Sacrament, the pledge of faith, they take: And euerie man vpon his sword doth sweare, By Knighthood, honor, or what else should binde; To assecure, the more, each others minde. 36 And when all this was done, and thought well done, And euerie one assures him good successe, And easie seemes the thing to euerie one That nought could crosse their plot, or them suppresse: Yet one among the rest (whose minde not wonne With th'ouer-weening thought of hot excesse, Nor headlong carryed with the streame of will, Nor by his owne election led to ill) 37 Iudicious Blunt (whose learning, valor, wit, Had taught true knowledge in the course of things; Knew dangers as they were, and th'humerous fit Of ware-lesse discontent, what end it brings) Counsels their heat, with calme graue words, and fit (Words well fore-thought, that from experience springs) And warnes a warier cariage in the thing; Least blind presumption worke their ruining. 38 “My Lords, sayth he, I knowe your wisedomes such, “As that of mine aduice you haue no need: “I knowe, you knowe how much the thing doth touch “The maine of all your states, your blood, your seed: “Yet, since the same concernes my life, as much “As his whose hand is chiefest in this deed, “And that my foote must go as farre, as his; “I thinke, my tongue may speake what needfull is. 39 “The thing we enterprize, I knowe, doth beare “Great possibilitie of good effect; “For-that so many men of might there are “That venture here this action to direct: “Which meaner wightes, of trust and credite bare, “Not so respected, could not looke t'effect. “For none, without great hopes, will follow such “Whose powre, and honor doth not promise much. 40 “Besides, this new, and doubtfull gouernment, “The wauering faith of people vaine, and light; “The secret hopes of many discontent; “The naturall affection to the right; “Our lawfull Sov'raignes life, in prison pent, “Whom men begin to pittie now, not spight; “Our well layd plot, and all, I must confesse, “With our iust cause, doth promise good successe. 41 “But this is yet the outward fayrest side “Of our desseigne: within, rests more of feare, “More dread of sad euent yet vndescri'd, “Then (my most worthy Lords) I would there were: “But yet, I speake not this as to diuide “Your thoughts from th'act, or to dismay your cheere; “Onely to adde, vnto your forward will, “A moderate feare, to cast the worst of ill. 42 “Danger before, and in, and after th'act, “You needes must graunt, is great, and to be waigh'd. “Before; least, while we do the deede protract, “It be by any of our selues bewraid: “For, many being priuie to the fact, “How hard it is to keepe it vnbetraid? “When the betrayer shal haue life and grace, “And rid himselfe of danger and disgrace. 43 “For, though some few continue resolute; “Yet many shrink, which at the first would dare, “And be the formost men to execute, “If th'act, and motion at one instant were: “But, intermission suffers men dispute “What dangers are, and cast with farther care: “Cold doubt cauils with honor, scorneth fame: “And in the end, feare waighes downe faith, with shame. 44 “Then in the act, what perils shall we finde, “If either place, or time, or other course, “Cause vs to alter th'order now assign'd? “Or that, then we expect, things happen worse? “If either error, or a fainting minde, “An indiscreet amazement, or remorse, “In any at that instant should be found; “How much it might the act, and all confound? 45 “After the deede, the dangers are no lesse; “Lest that, our forwardnes not seconded “By our owne followers, and accomplices “(Being kept backe, or slowe, or hindered) “The hastie multitude rush-on, t'oppresse “Confused weakenes, there vnsuccored; “Or rayse another head, of that same race, “T'auenge his death, and prosecute the case. 46 “All this (my Lords) must be considered “(The best and worst of that which may succeede) “That valour mixt with feare, boldnesse with dread, “May march more circumspect, with better heed. “And, to preuent these mischiefs mentioned, “Is, by our faith, our secrecie, and speed. “For, euen already is the worke begun, “And we rest all vndone, till all be done. 47 “And though I could haue wisht another course, “In open fielde t'haue hazarded my blood; “Yet some are heere, whose loue is of that force “To draw my life, whom zeale hath not withstood: “But, like you not of your desseigne the worse: “If the successe be good, your course is good: “And ending well, our honor then begins. “No hand of strife is pure, but that which wins. 48 This sayd, a sad still silence held their mindes, Vpon the feareful proiect of their woe; But that, not long, ere forward Furie findes: Incouraging perswasions on to goe. We must (sayd they) we wil, our honour bindes, Our safety bids, our fayth must haue it so: We know the worst can come, 'tis thought vpon: We cannot shift; being in, we must goe on. 49 And on in deed they went; but (ô!) not farre: A fatal stop trauerst their headlong course; Their drift comes knowne, and they discouered are: For, some of many will be false, of force. Aumarle became the man, that did all marre, Whether through indiscretion, chance, or worse: He makes his peace, with offring others blood; And shewes the King, how all the matter stood. 50 Then lo dismayde, confusion all possest, Th'afflicted troupe, hearing their plot descride. Then runnes amaz'd Distresse, with sad vnrest, To this, to that, to flie, to stand, to hide: Distracted Terror knew not what was best; On what determination to abide. At last, Despaire would yet stand to the Sword, To trie what friendes would doe, or fate affoord. 51 Then this, then that mans ayde, they craue, implore; Poste here for helpe, seeke there their followers; Coniure their friendes they had, labour for more, Sollicite all reputed fauourers, Who Richards cause seem'd to affect before: And, in his name, write, pray, sende messengers; To try what faith was left, if by this art Any would step to take Afflictions part. 52 And some were found; and some againe draw backe: Vncertaine power could not it selfe retaine: Intreate they may, authoritie they lacke: And here, and there they march (but, all in vaine) With desp'rate course; like those that see their wracke Euen on the Rockes of death, and yet they straine That death may not them idly finde t'attend Their certaine last, but worke to meet their end. 53 And long they stand not, ere the chiefe, surpriz'd, Conclude with their deare blood their tragedie: And all the rest, disperst run—some disguis'd— To vnknowne coastes; some to the shores do flye; Some to the woods, or whither feare aduis'd: But running from, all to destruction hie. The breach once made vpon a battered state, Downe goes Distresse; no shelter shroudes their fate. 54 And now what horror in their soules doth growe! What sorrowes, with their friendes, and neere allies! What mourning in their ruin'd houses now! How many childrens plaints, and mothers cryes! How many wofull Widowes left to bow To sad disgrace! what perisht families! What heires of hie rich hopes, their thoughts must frame To base-downe-looking pouertie and shame! 55 This slaughter and calamitie fore-goes Thy eminent destruction, wofull King. This is the bloody Comet of thy woes, That doth fore-tell thy present ruyning. Here was thy ende decreed, when these men rose: And euen with theirs, this act thy death did bring; Or hastened, at the least, vpon this ground: Yet, if not this, another had beene found. 56 Kings (Lords of times and of occasions) may Take their aduantage, when, and how they list: For, now the Realme, he thought in this dismay, T'auoyd like mischiefes, neither would resist, Nor feele the wound at all; since, by this way, All future disturbations would desist; The roote cut off, from whence these tumults rose, He should haue rest, the Common-wealth repose. 57 He knew this time: and yet he would not seeme Too quicke to wrath, as if affecting blood; But yet complaines so farre, that men might deeme He would 'twere done, and that he thought it good: And wisht that some would so his life esteeme, As ridde him of these feares wherein he stood: And there-with eyes a Knight, that then was by; Who soone could learne his lesson, by his eye. 58 The man, he knew, was one that willingly For one good looke would hazard soule and all; An instrument for any villanie, That needed no commission more at all: A great ease to the King, that should, hereby, Not neede in this a course of iustice call, Nor seeme to wil the act: for, though what's wrought Were his owne deed, he grieues should so be thought. 59 “So foule a thing (ô!) thou Iniustice art, “That tort'rest both the dooer and distrest. “For, when a man hath done a wicked part, “How doth he striue t'excuse, to make the best, “To shift the fault, t'vnburthen his charg'd hart, “And glad to finde the least surmise of rest! “And if he could make his, seeme others sin; “What great repose, what ease he findes therein! 60 This Knight; but yet, why should I call him Knight, To giue impietie this reuerent stile? Title of honour, worth, and vertues right, Should not be giuen to a wretch so vile: But pardon me, if I do not aright: It is because I will not here defile My vnstaind verse, with his opprobrious name, And grace him so, to place him in the same. 61 This caitife goes, and with him takes eight more As desperate as himselfe; impiously bold (Such villaines, as he knew would not abhorre To execute what wicked act he would) And hastes him downe to Pomfret; where, before, The restless King, conuaide, was laid in hold: There would he do the deed, he thought should bring To him great grace and fauour, with his King. 62 Whether the soule receiues intelligence, By her neere Genius, of the bodies end And so impartes a sadnesse to the sense Fore-going ruine, whereto it doth tend: Or whether Nature else hath conference With profound sleepe, and so doth warning send By prophetizing dreames, what hurt is neere, And giues the heauie careful hart to feare: 63 How-euer, so it is, the now sad King (Tost here and there, his quiet to confound) Feeles a straunge waight of sorrowes, gathering Vpon his trembling hart, and sees no ground; Feeles sodaine terror bring cold shiuering; Listes not to eate, still muses, sleepes vnsound; His senses droope, his steady eyes vnquicke; And much he ayles; and yet he is not sicke. 64 The morning of that day, which was his last, After a wearie rest rysing to paine, Out at a little grate his eyes he cast Vpon those bordering hils, and open Plaine, And viewes the towne, and sees how people past: Where others libertie, makes him complaine The more his owne, and grieues his soule the more; Conferring captiue-Crownes, with freedome poore. 65 “O happie man, sayth hee, that lo I see “Grazing his cattle in those pleasant fieldes! “If he but knew his good (how blessed hee, “That feeles not what affliction Greatnes yeeldes!) “Other then what hee is, he would not bee, “Nor change his state with him that Scepters wieldes: “Thine, thine is that true life; That is to liue, “To rest secure, and not rise vp to grieue. 66 “Thou sitst, at home, safe, by thy quiet fire, “And hear'st of others harmes; but feelest none: “And there thou telst of Kings, and who aspire, “Who fall, who rise, who triumphs, who do mone: “Perhaps thou talkst of mee, and dost inquire “Of my restraint, why here I liue alone, “And pittiest this my miserable fall: “For, pittie must haue part; enuie, not all. 67 “Thrice happy you that looke, as from the shore, “And haue no venture in the wracke you see; “No int'rest, no occasion to deplore “Other mens trauailes, while your selues sit free. “How much doth your sweet rest make vs the more “To see our miserie, and what we bee! “Whose blinded Greatnes, euer in turmoyle, “Still seeking happy life, makes life a toyle. 68 “Great Dioclesian (and more great therefore “For yeelding-vp that whereto pride aspires) “Reckning thy Gardens in Illiria more “Then all the Empire, all what th'earth admires; “Thou well didst teach, that he is neuer poore “That little hath, but he that much desires; “Finding more true delight in that small ground, “Then, in possessing all the earth, was found. 69 “Are Kings that freedome giue, themselues not free “As meaner men, to take what they may giue? “What, are they of so fatall a degree, “That they cannot descend from that, and liue? “Vnlesse they still be Kings can they not bee, “Nor may they their authority suruiue? “Will not my yeelded Crowne redeeme my breath? “Still am I fear'd? is there no way, but death? 70 Scarce this word, Death, from Sorrow did proceed, When in rusht one, and tels him, such a knight Is new arriv'd, and comes from Court in speed. What newes sayd he, with him, that traytrous wight? What, more remouing yet? alas! what need? Are we not farre ynough sent out of sight? Or is this place, here, not sufficient strong To guard vs in? or must we haue more wrong? 71 By this, the bloody troope were at the dore; When-as a sodaine and a strange dismay Inforc't them straine, who should go in before: One offers, and in offring makes a stay: An other forward sets, and doth no more: A third the like, and none durst make the way: So much the horror of so vile a deed, In vilest mindes, deterres them to proceed. 72 At length, as to some great aduentrous fight, This Brauo cheeres these dastards, all hee can; And valiantly their courage doth incite, And all against one weake vnarmed man: A great exployte, and fit for such a knight; Wherein, so much renowne his valor wan. But see, how men that verie Presence feare, Which once, they knew, Authority did beare. 73 Then, on thrusts one, and he would formost be To shead anothers blood; but lost his owne: For, entring in, as soone as he did see The face of Maiestie, to him well knowne; Like Marius Souldier at Minternum, hee Stood still amaz'd, his courage ouer-throwne. The King, seeing this, starting fr? where he sate, Out from his trembling hand his weapon gate. 74 Thus, euen his foes, who came to bring him death, Bring him a weapon, that before had none; That yet he might not idly lose his breath, But die reueng'd, in action, not alone. And this good chaunce, that thus much fauoureth, He slackes not: for, he presently speedes one: And, Lion-like, vpon the rest he flyes: And here falles one, and there another lies. 75 And vp and down he trauerses his ground; Now wardes a felling blowe, now strikes againe, Then nimbly shiftes a thrust, then lends a wound, Now backe he giues, then rushes-on amaine. His quicke and ready hand doth so confound These shamefull beastes, that foure of them lie slaine: And all had perisht happily and well, But for one act, that (ô!) I grieue to tell. 76 This coward Knight, seeing with shame and feare His men thus slaine, and doubting his owne end, Leapes vp into a chaire that (lo) was there, The-whiles the King did all his courage bend Against those foure, which now before him were, Doubting not who behind him doth attend; And plyes his hands vndaunted, vnaffeard, And with good heart, and life for life he stird. 77 And whiles he this, and that, and each mans blowe Doth eye, defend, and shift, being layd-to sore, Backward he beares for more aduantage now, Thinking the wall would safegard him the more; When, lo, with impious hand, ô wicked thou, That shamefull durst not come to strike before, Behind him gav'st that lamentable wound, Which layd that wretched Prince flat on the ground. 78 Now, proditorious wretch, what hast thou done, To make this barbarous base assassinate Vpon the person of a Prince, and one Fore-spent with sorrow, and all desolate? What great aduancement hast thou hereby wonne, By being the instrument to perpetrate So foule a deed? where is thy grace in Corte, For such a seruice, acted in this sort? 79 First, he for whom thou dost this villanie (Though pleas'd therewith) will not auouch thy fact, But let the weight of thine owne infamie Fall on thee, vnsupported, and vnbackt: Then, all men else will loath thy treacherie, And thou thy selfe abhorre thy proper act: “So th'Wolfe, in hope the Lyons grace to win “Betraying other beastes, lost his owne skinne. 80 But now, as this sweet Prince distended lay, And him nor Life, nor Death, their owne could call, (For, Life, remouing, rid not all away; And Death, though entring, had not seis'd on all) That short-tym'd motion had a little stay (The mouer ceasing) though it were but small: (As th'Organ-sound, a time, suruiues the stop, Before it doth the dying note giue vp). 81 When, lo, there streames a spring of bloud so fast, From those deepe woundes, as all imbru'd the face Of that accursed caytiue, as he past (After the deed effected) through the place: And therewithall those dying eyes did cast Such an vpbrayding looke on his disgrace (Seeming to checke so cowardly a part) As left th'impression euen in his hart. 82 And thus one King, most neere in bloud ally'd, Is made th'oblation for the others peace. Which peace yet was not hereby ratifi'd So, as it could all future feares release. For, though the other did forthwith prouide To haue the rumour run of his decease, By drawing the corps to London, where it was Layd (three dayes to be seene) with open face: 83 Yet, so great was this execrable deed, As men would scarce therein belieue their eyes; Much lesse their eares: and many sought to feed The easie creditours of nouelties, By voycing him aliue; how hee was freed By strange escape out of his miseries: And many did conspire now to relieue Him dead, who had forsaken him aliue. 84 And many suffred for his Cause, when now He had none: many wisht for him againe, When they perceiv'd th'exchange did not allow Their hopes so much as they did looke to gaine, By traffiquing of kings; and all saw how Their full exspectances were in the wane. They had a King was more then him before; But yet a king, where they were nought the more. 85 And sure, this murthered Prince, though weake he was, He was not ill; nor yet so weake, but that He shew'd much Martiall valour in his place, Aduentring oft his person for the State: And might amongst our better Princes paste; Had not the flatterie, rapine, and debate Of factious Lords and greedie Officers Disgrac't his actions, and abus'd his yeares. 86 Nor is it so much Princes weakenesses, As the corruption of their Ministers, Wherby the Common-wealth receiues distress. For, they, attending their particulars, Make imperfections their aduantages To be themselues both Kings and Councellors. And, sure, this Common-wealth can neuer take Hurt by weake kings, but such as we doo make. 87 Besides, he was (which people much respect In Princes, and which pleases vulgarly) Of goodly personage, and of sweete aspect, Of milde accesse, and liberalitie; And feastes, and shewes, and triumphs did affect, As the delights of youth and iollitie: But, here, the great profusion and expence Of his reuenues, bred him much offence: 88 And gaue aduantage vnto enmitie, This grieuous accusation to prefer; “That he consum'd the common Treasurie: “Whereof he being the simple vsager “But for the State (not in proprietie) “Did alien at his pleasure, and transfer “The same t'his minions, and to whome hee list; “By which, the Common-wealth was to subsist. 89 “Whereby, sayd they, the poore concussed State “Shall euer be exacted for supplyes. Which accusation was th'occasion, that His successour by order nullifies Many his Patents, and did reuocate And reassume his liberalities: And yet, for all these wastes, these gifts and feasts, He was not found a Bankrupt in his chests. 90 But they, who tooke to Syndicque in this sorte The Actions of a Monarch, knew those things Wherein the accoumpts were likely to fall short Betweene the State of Kingdomes, and their Kings: Which president, of pestilent import (Had not the heauens blest thy indeuourings) Against thee Henry, had beene likewise brought, Th'example made of thy example wrought. 91 For, though this bountie, and this liberalness, A glorious vertue be; it better fits Great men, then kings: who, giuing in excesse, Giue not their owne, but others benefits: Which calles-vp manies hopes, but pleasures lesse; Destroying far more loue, then it begets. For, Iustice is their Virtue: that alone Makes them sit sure, and glorifies the Throne. The ende of the third Booke. THE FOVRTH BOOKE. THE ARGVMENT. King Henrie, his excuses publishes For Richards death; and truce doth intertaine With France. The Scots, aggrieu'd for wrongs, address Themselues to warre; and are appeas'd againe. The Welsh rebel. The Percies practises (To parte the State) are stopt, in battell slaine. Continuall troubles still afflict this King; Till Death an end doth to his trauailes bring. 1 The bounds once ouer-gone, that hold men in, They neuer stay; but on, from bad to worse. “Wrongs do not leaue off there, where they begin; “But, still beget new mischiefes in their course. Now, Henrie, thou hast added to thy sinne Of vsurpation, and intruding force, A greater crime; which makes that gone before T'appeare more then it did, and noted more. 2 For, now thou art inforc't t'apologise With forraine States, for two enormious things, Wherein, thou dost appeare to scandalise The publike Right, and common Cause of Kings: Which, though (with all the skill thou canst deuise) Thou ouerlay'st with fayrest colourings; Yet th'vnder-worke, transparent, shewes too plaine. “Where open acts accuse, th'excuse is vaine. 3 And these defences, are but complements, To dallie with confining Potentates; Who, busied in their proper gouernments, Do seldome tend th'affaires of other States: Their wisedome, which to present powre consents, Liue-dogges before dead Lyons, estimates: “And no man more respects these publike wrongs, “Then so much as t'his priuate state belongs. 4 Yet, most it seem'd the French King to import; As sharer in his daughters iniurie: “Though bloud, in Princes, links not in such sort, “As that it is of any powre to tye, Where their estates may seeme t'aduenture hurt; Or where there is not a necessitie, That doth combine them with a stronger chaine, Then all these great Alliances containe. 5 For, though this King might haue resentiment, And will, t'auenge him of this iniurie: Yet, at that time, his State being turbulent, Factious, and full of partialitie, And oftentimes he himselfe impotent, By meanes of his Phreneticque maladie; It was not likely, any good could rise By vndertaking such an enterprise. 6 And therefore both sides, vpon entercourse (As fitted best their present termes) agreed, The former truce continue should in force, According as it had beene fore-decreed Vpon the match with Richard; and a course For Isabel (with all conuenient speed) Prouided, with an honorable Traine Suting her state, to be sent home againe. 7 Whome willingly they would haue still retain'd, And matcht vnto the Prince: but shee (though yong; Yet sensible of that which appertain'd To honor, and renowne) scornd any tongue That offred such a motion; and disdaynd To haue it thought, she would but heare that wrong Mov'd to her, of her Lord, and husband dead, To haue his murtherers race inioy his bed. 8 Besides; the French (doubting the Gouernment, Thus gotten, would be subiect still to strife) Not willing were to vrge her to consent T'accept a troublous, and vncertaine life: And, being returnd, she grew in th'end content To be (at home) a Duke of Orleance wife; Scap't from such stormes of powre, holding it best To be belowe her selfe, to be at rest. 9 And so hath Henrie assecur'd that side, And therewithall his State of Gasconie: Which, on th'intelligence was notifi'd Of Richards death, were wrought to mutinie; And hardly came to be repacifi'd, And kept to hold in their fidelitie: So much, to him were they affectioned, For hauing beene amongst them borne and bred. 10 These toyles abrode, these tumults with his owne (As if the frame of all disioynted were, With this disordred shifting of the Crowne) Fell, in the reuolution of one yeare. Beside; the Scotte (in discontentment growne, For the detayning, and supporting here, The scourge of all that kingdome, George Dunbar) With fire and sword, proclaymes an open war; 11 Taking their time, in these disturbances And newnesse of a wauering Gouernment, T'auenge them of their former grieuances, And by our spoyles their fortunes to augment. Against whose forces, Henry furnishes A powrefull Army, and in person went; But warres with a retyring enemy, With much more trauaile then with victorie. 12 And, being (by sharp, deformed Winters force) Caus'd to retire, he findes new stormes at home, From other Coasts arysing; that prov'd worse Then those, which now hee was returned from. In VVales, a Cause of Law, by violent course, Was (from a variance) now a warre become; And Owen Glendour, who with Gray of late Contests for priuate landes, now seekes a State. 13 Whom to represse, he early in the Spring, With all prouisions fit, doth forward set; When straight his enemies (not purposing To hazard battaile) to the mountaines get. Where, after long and weary trauayling, Without performing any great defeat, He onely their prouisions wastes, and burnes, And with some prey of Cattell home returnes. 14 Wherewith, the Rebell rather was the more Incourag'd, then addaunted; and begun T'aduenture farther then he did before; Seeing such a Monarch had so little done, Being com'n in person, with so great a powre, And sodainely againe retyr'd and gone, “For, in this case, they helpe, who hurt so small; “And he hath nothing done, that doth not all. 15 But now (behold) other new heads appeare, New Hidra's of rebellion, that procure More worke to doo, and giue more cause of feare; And shew'd, that nothing in his State stood sure. And these, euen of his chiefest followers were, Of whome he might presume him most secure; Who had th'especiall ingins beene, to reare His fortunes vp, vnto the State they were. 16 The Percies were the men; men of great might, Strong in alliance, and in courage strong: Who now conspire; vnder pretence to right Such wrongs, as to the Common wealth belong: Vrg'd, either through their conscience, or despight, Or finding now the part they tooke was wrong: Or else Ambition hereto did them call, Or others enuy'd grace; or, rather, all. 17 And such they were, who might presume t'haue done Much for the king, and honour of the State; Hauing the chiefest actions vnder-gone, Both forraine and domesticall of late: Beside that famous day of Homeldon; Where Hotspur gaue that wonderfull defeat Vnto the Scottes, as shooke that kingdome more Then many Monarchs armies had before. 18 Which might perhaps aduance their mindes, so farre Aboue the leuell of subiection, as T'assume to them the glory of that war; Where all things, by their powre, were brought to passe: They, being so mightie, and so popular, And their command so spacious as it was, Might (in their State) forget, how all these things That subiects doo effect, must be their Kings. 19 And so fell after into discontent, For that the king requir'd to haue, as his, Those Lords were taken prisoners; whome they ment To hold still as their proper purchases: Then, that he would not, at their sute, consent To worke their Cosin Mortimers release, Out of the Rebell Owen Glendour's hands; Who held him prisoner, in disgracefull bands. 20 But be, what will, the cause; strong was their plot. Their parties great, meanes good, the season fit, Their practice close, their faith suspected not, Their states far off, and they of wary wit: Who, with large promises, so wooe the Scot To aide their Cause, as he consents to it; And glad was to disturne that furious streame Of warre, on vs, that else had swallowed them. 21 Then ioyne they with the Welsh; who, now wel train'd, In Armes and action dayly grew more great. Their Leader, by his wiles, had much attaynd, And done much mischiefe on the English State: Beside, his prisoner Mortimer he gain'd From being a foe, to b'his confederate; A man the King much fear'd: and well he might; Least he should looke whether his Crowne stood right. 22 For, Richard (for the quiet of the State) Before he tooke those Irish warres in hand, About Succession doth deliberate: And, finding how the certaine Right did stand, With full consent this man did ordinate The heyre apparent to the Crowne and Land; Whose competencie was of tender touch: Although his might was small, his right was much. 23 With these, the Percies them confederat, And (as three heads) conioyne in one intent: And (instituting a Triumuirate) Do part the Land, in triple gouernment; Diuiding thus, among themselues, the State: The Percies should rule all the North, from Trent; And Glendour, VVales; the Earle of March should be Lord of the South, from Trent: and so they 'gree. 24 Then, those faire bayts these Trouble-States still vse (Pretence of common good, the Kings ill Course) Must be cast forth, the people to abuse, And giue their Cause, and them, the better force. The king, for tyranny, they doo accuse, By whom the State was growne from bad to worse; A periur'd man, who held all faith in scorne: Whose trusted Oathes had others made forsworne. 25 And, therewithal, the execrable act, On their late murthered King, they aggrauate: How he imploy'd the dooers of the fact, Whom afterwards hee did remunerate: And dayly such taxations did exact, As were against the Order of the State; Presuming, those great summes hee did impose, About his priuate vses to dispose: 26 And how he was inuironed with such As had possest him; and in slanderous sort Accus'd them so, as they durst not approche To cleare themselues of such vniust report: And, thereupon, they flatly disauouch To yeld him more obedience, or support: And, as t'a periurd Duke of Lancaster, Their Cartell of Defiance they preferre; 27 Protesting, these obiections to make good, With sword in hand, and to confirme and seale Their vndertaking, with their dearest bloud, As Procurators for the Common-weale: And that vpon their Consciences it stood, And did import their dutie and their zeale Vnto the State, as Peeres, to see redrest Those miseries wherewith it was opprest. 28 Great seem'd their Cause: and greatly, too, did adde The peoples loue thereto, these crymes impos'd; That many gathered to the troupes they had, And many sent them aide though vndisclos'd: So that, the King, with all maine speed, was glad Both by his remonstrances well compos'd, And with his sword (his best defence) prouide To right himselfe, and to correct their pride: 29 Divulging, first, a fayre Apologie Of his cleere heart, touching the foule report Of that assassinate: which vtterly He doth abiure; protesting, in no sort T'agree thereto, in will or priuitie: And, how he had beene vsed to extort, The State could witnesse best; by whose consent Was granted what he had, in Parlement. 30 Which neuer was, but onely one supply, In foure yeares troublous and expensiue Raigne: And that, vpon extreame necessitie, The safetie of the publicke to maintaine: And that the Percies best could testifie, How most that mony issued was, againe; To whom the same was rendred, to the end To warre the Scot, and Borders to defend: 31 And that the rest was, to the same effect For which it was obtaynd, in like sort spent. And where-as they did slanderously obiect, How that they durst not hazard to present In person their defences, in respect He was incenst by some maleuolent; It was most false: for, he knew no defence They were to make, till now they made offence. 32 And how far, he had been, from cruelty, Both VVales, and Scotland could him witnes beare; Where, those effects of his great clemencie, In sparing bloud, do to his cost appeare: Much more, his subiects finde his lenitie; Whose loue he seekes to haue, and not their feare. “But thus, said he, they euer do pretend “To haue receiv'd a wrong, who wrong intend. 33 Not to giue time vnto th'increasing rage, And gathering furie, foorth hee marcht with speed; Least more delay, or giuing longer age To th'euill growne, it might the cure exceed. All his best men at Armes, and Leaders sage, All he prepar'd hee could; and all did need. For, to a mighty worke thou goest, ô King, That equall spirits, and equall powres shal bring. 34 There shall young Hotspur, with a fury led, Ingrapple with thy sonne, as fierce as hee: There Martiall VVorster, long experienced In forraine armes, shall come t'incounter thee. There Dowglas, to thy Stafford, shall make head: There Vernon, for thy valiant Blunt, shall be. There, shalt thou finde a doubtfull bloudy day; Though sickenesse keep Northumberland away. 35 Who yet reserv'd (though, after, quit for this) Another tempest on thy head to rayse; As if, still, wrong-reuenging Nemesis Meant to afflict all thy continuing dayes: And here this field hee happely doth misse, For thy great good; and therefore well hee stayes. What might his force haue done, being brought thereto, When that already, gaue so much to doo? 36 The swift approche, and vnexpected speed, The King had made vpon this new-rays'd force, In th'vnconfirmed troupes, much feare did breed, Vntimely hind'ring their intended course: The ioyning with the Welsh (they had decreed) Was hereby dasht; which made their Cause the worse: Northumberland, with forces from the North, Expected to be there, was not set forth. 37 And yet, vndaunted Hotspur, seeing the King So neere arriv'd; leauing the worke in hand, With forward speed his forces marshalling, Sets forth, his farther comming to withstand: And, with a cheerefull voyce incouraging His well experienc't and aduentrous Band, Brings on his Army, eger vnto fight; And plac't the same, before the King in sight. 38 “This day (saith he) my valiant trusty friendes, “What-euer it doth giue, shal glory giue; “This day, with honor, frees our State, or endes “Our misery with fame, that still shal liue: “And doo but thinke, how well the same he spends, “Who spends his blood, his Country to relieue. “What? haue we hands, and shall we seruile bee? “Why were swordes made? but, to preserue men free. 39 Besides, th'assured hope of victorie, Which we may euen promise on our side, Against this weake constrayned company; Whom force and feare, not will and loue doth guide: Against a Prince, whose foul impiety The heauens doo hate, the earth cannot abide: Our number being no lesse, our courage more, No doubt we haue it, if wee worke therefore. 40 This sayd, and thus resolv'd, euen bent to charge Vpon the King; who well their order view'd, And wary noted all the course at large Of their proceeding, and their multitude: And deeming better, if he could discharge The day with safetie, and some peace conclude, Great proffers sendes of pardon and of grace If they would yeeld, and quietnesse imbrace. 41 Which though his feares might driue him to propose, To time his businesse, for some other ende; Yet, sure, hee could not meane t'haue peace with those, Who did in that supreame degree offend: Nor were they such, as would bee wonne with showes; Or breath of oathes, or vowes could apprehend: So that in honor, th'offers, he doth make, Were not for him to giue, nor them to take. 42 And yet this much his courses doo approue, He was not bloudy, in his Naturall; And yeeld he did to more, then might behoue His dignitie, to haue dispenst withall: And, vnto VVorster, hee himselfe did moue A reconcilement to be made of all: But VVorster, know'ing it could not be secur'd, His Nephews on-set (yet for all) procur'd. 43 Which seeing the King (with greater wrath incenst) Rage, against furie, doth with speede prepare. And though, sayd he, I could haue wel dispenst With this dayes bloud, which I haue sought to spare; That greater glory might haue recompenst The forward worth of these, that so much dare; That we might good haue had by th'ouerthrowne, And th'wounds we make, might not haue beene our owne: 44 Yet, since that other mens iniquitie Calles-on the sword of wrath, against my will; And that themselues exact this crueltie, And I constrayned am this bloud to spill; Then on, braue followers, on courageously, True-harted subiects, against traytors ill: And spare not them, who seeke to spoyle vs all Whose foul confused end, soone see you shal. 45 Forth-with, began these fury-mouing sounds, The notes of wrath, the musicke brought from Hell, The ratling Drums (which trumpets voyce confounds) The cryes, th'incouragements, the shouting shrill; That, all about, the beaten ayre rebounds Confused thundring-murmurs horrible; To robbe all sense, except the sense to fight. Well hands may worke: the minde hath lost his sight. 46 O warre! begot in pride and luxurie, The child of malice, and reuengeful hate; Thou impious good, and good impietie, That art the foul refiner of a State; Vniust-iust scourge of mens iniquitie, Sharpe-easer of corruptions desperate; Is there no meanes but that a sin-sicke Land Must be let bloud with such a boysterous hand? 47 How well mightst thou haue, here beene spar'd this day, Had not wrong-counsaild Percy beene peruerse? Whose forward hand, inur'd to woundes, makes way Vpon the sharpest fronts of the most fierce: Where now an equall furie thrusts to stay And backe-repell that force, and his disperse: Then these assaile, then those re-chase againe, Till stayd with new-made hils of bodies slaine. 48 There, lo that new-appearing glorious starre, Wonder of Armes, the terror of the field, Young Henrie, laboring where the stoutest are, And euen the stoutest forceth backe to yeeld; There is that hand boldned to bloud and warre, That must the sword, in wondrous actions, wield: Though better, he had learnd with others bloud; A lesse expence to vs, to him more good. 49 Yet here had he not speedy succour lent To his indangered father, neere opprest, That day had seene the full accomplishment Of all his trauailes, and his finall rest: For, Mars-like Dowglas all his forces bent T'incounter, and to grapple with the best; As if disdayning any other thing To doo, that day, but to subdue a King. 50 And three, with fierie courage, he assailes; Three, all as kings adornd in royall wise: And each successiue after other quailes; Still wondring, whence so many Kings should rise. And, doubting lest his hand or eye-sight fayles, In these confounded, on a fourth hee flyes, And him vnhorses too: whom had hee sped, He then all Kings, in him, had vanquished. 51 For Henrie had diuided, as it were, The person of himselfe, into foure parts; To be lesse knowne, &amp; yet known euery where, The more to animate his peoples harts: Who, cheered by his presence, would not spare To execute their best and worthyest parts. By which, two special things effected are; His safetie, and his subiects better care. 52 And neuer worthy Prince a day did quit With greater hazard, and with more renowne, Then thou didst, mightie Henry, in this fight; Which onely made thee owner of thine owne: Thou neuer proov'dst the Tenure of thy right (How thou didst hold thy easie-gotten Crown) Till now: and, now, thou shew'st thy selfe Chiefe Lord, By that especial right of kings; the Sword. 53 And deare it cost, and much good bloud is shed To purchase thee, a sauing victorie: Great Stafford thy high Constable lyes dead, With Shorly, Clifton, Gawsell, Caluerly, And many more; whose braue deathes witnessed Their noble valour and fidelitie: And many more had left their dearest bloud Behind, that day, had Hotspur longer stood. 54 But he, as Dowglas, with his furie ledde, Rushing into the thickest woods of speares, And brakes of swordes, still laying at the Head (The life of th'Army) whiles he nothing feares Or spares his owne, comes all inuironed With multitude of powre, that ouer-beares His manly worth: who yeeldes not, in his fall; But fighting dyes, and dying kils withal. 55 What Arke, what trophey, what magnificence Of glory, Hot-spurre, hadst thou purchas't here; Could but thy Cause, as fayre as thy pretence, Be made vnto thy Country to appeare! Had it beene her protection and defence (Not thy ambition) made thee sell so deare Thy selfe this day; shee must haue here made good An euerlasting Statüe for thy bloud. 56 Which thus misspent, thy Army presently, (As if they could not stand, when thou wert downe) Disperst in rout, betooke them all to flie: And Dowglas, faint with wounds, &amp; ouer-throwne, Was taken; who yet wonne the enemie Which tooke him (by his noble valour showne, In that dayes mighty worke) and was preserv'd With all the grace, and honor he deserv'd. 57 VVorc'ster (who had escap't vnhappily His death in battel) on a Scaffold dyes, The next after, in the company Of other chiefest of that enterprise. And, so, the tempest of this mutinie Became allay'd; and those great ieoperdies Blowne-ouer in this sort, the Coasts well cleer'd, But for one threatning cloud, that yet appear'd. 58 Northumberland (recouered) still out stands, The principall of this great family And faction; hauing Berwike in his hands, With other holdes; strong by confed'racie With Scotland; mighty by his owne command: And, likely now, his vtmost powre to trie, T'auenge him on the ruine of his Bloud, And ioyne with Wales; which yet vndanted stood. 59 Which mov'd the king (who had too much indur'd In this dayes worke, to hazard new againe) By all the aptest meanes could be procur'd To lay to draw him in, by any traine. And write he did, and vow'd, and him assur'd (Vpon his princely word) to intertaine With former grace, if hee would but submit, And come to yeeld th'obedience that was fit. 60 The Earle, be'ing now by this defeat dismay'd (And fearing his confederates would fayle With Fortune, and betray, rather then ayde, Those who are downe; being for their owne auayle) Relying on his Sov'raignes oath obay'd; Which, with his tender griefs, did much preuaile: And in hee came, and had no detryment, But (for a shew) some short imprisonment. 61 The Parlement, that afterward insu'd, Restor'd him t'all his dignities and landes. And now none, but the Welsh, seem'd to seclude The king, from hauing wholly in his hands All peace within: and them he had pursu'd Whiles this braue army, with these ready bands, Were yet on foot; could he but haue got pay To hold them, and his charge of war defray. 62 But, that hee could not gaine, though all the wayes That might be wrought, he labours to procure Meanes to effect the same. But, those delayes, And long protraction, which he must indure By way of Parlement, so much betrayes The opportunitie, that might secure His vndertaking; as, the occasion, lost, Draue both the State, and him, to greater cost. 63 For, now the Rebell, thus forborne, growes strong Both in his reputation and successe: For, hauing with his powre held out so long, Many aduenture (with more forwardnesse) To yeeld him ayd, and to support his wrong: And forraine Princes (in his businesse Whom hee sollicites) now wil lend their hand To hould him vp; seeing, himselfe can stand. 64 And thus he prospers; whiles, the King here spent Much time to leuie treasure, to maintaine His charge abrode: which, with that discontent, That murmure, those denyals, hee doth gaine, As that hee findes it euen as turbulent To warre for it, as with it, all his Raigne; Though hee had those inforcements of expence, Both for offence, retaynements, and defence. 65 For, here beside these troubles in the Land, His large Dominions, held abrode, require A plentiful and a prepared hand To guard them; where so mightie men aspire T'assaile, distract and trouble his Command, With hopes, with promises, with sword and fire: And then as deepe importes, his Coastes to cleere; Which, by his neighbors, much infested were. 66 The Flemings, Britaines, with the French and all, Attempt incursions, and worke much despight: Orleance, for Guien: and here the Conte, Saint Paul, For Calais labours, and the Ile of Wight. Wherein, though neither had successe at all; Yet Cleremont ouercame, and wonne by fight Important Holdes, in Gasconie the-while, And did the English much distresse and spoyle. 67 All which require prouisions to withstand: And all are succord with great prouidence: A Nauie, to secure the Seas, is mann'd, And forces sent to Calais, for defence. And wherein other parts defectiue stand, They are supply'd, with carefull diligence: So that his subiects could not but well knowe, That what they granted, he did sure bestowe. 68 Nor did hee spare himselfe, nor his; but (bent All-wholly vnto actiue Worthynesse) The Prince of VVales vnto his Prouince sent; Where, hee was sure, hee should not take his ease: His second sonne is, with the Earle of Kent, Imployd (as Gouernour) to keepe the Seas. A third (though very yong) likewise sent forth With VVestmerland, attends vnto the North. 69 Thus were they bred, who after were to bee Men amongst men: here, with these graue Adioynts (These learned Maisters) they were taught to see Themselues, to read the world, and keep their points. Thus were they entred in the first degree (And Accedence) of action; which acquaints Them, with the Rules of Worth and Nobleness: Which, in true Concord, they learn'd well t'expresse. 70 And whiles h'attends the State thus carefully, The Earle of Marches children are conuay'd Out of the Towre of VVindsor, secretly; Being prisoners there, not for their merit lay'd, But, for their Bloud; and to the ende-whereby This Chayne of Nature might be interlay'd Betweene the Father and his high intents, To hold him backe, to saue these innocents. 71 For which attempt (though it were frustrated By their recouerie, who were got againe) Aumarle (now Duke of Yorke) is chalenged, By his owne sister, to haue layd that trayne; Who (late) her Lord, with others ruined, In secretly betraying them, t'obtaine His grace and peace: which yet contents him not. For, Who hath grace and peace by treason got? 72 So much did loue, t'her executed Lord, Predominate in this faire Ladies hart, As in that region, it would not afford Nature a place, to rest in any part Of her affections; but that she abhord Her proper blood, and left to doo the part Of sisterhood, to doo that of a wife; T'auenge a Husbands death, by Brothers life. 73 Vpon which accusation, presently The Duke committed is, without much stirre Or vulgar noyse; for that it tenderly Did touch the secretst wounds of Lancaster: When streight, another new conspiracie (As if it were a certaine successor Ally'd to this) ingendred in the North, Is by th'Archbishop Scroope with power brought forth: 74 And with faire zeale, and pietie, approv'd To be for th'vniuersall benefit And succour of the people, who (soone mov'd By such perswaders, as are held vpright; And for their zeale, and charitie belov'd) Vse not t'examine if the Cause be right, But leap into the toyle, and are vndon By following them that they rely'd vpon. 75 Here, new aspersions, with new obloquies, Are layde on old deserts; and future ill On present sufferings, bruted to aryse, That farther grieuances ingender wil. And then concussion, rapine, pilleries, Their Catalogue of accusations fill. Which to redresse, they doo presume to make Religion to auow the part they take. 76 And euen as Canterburie did produce A Pardon to aduance him to the Crown; The like now Yorke pronounces, to induce His faction for the pulling of him down.: Whilst th'ignorant, deceiv'd by this abuse, Makes others ends to be as if their owne. But, what wold these haue don against the crimes, Oppressions, ryots, wastes of other times? 77 Since now they had a Monarch, and a man, Rays'd by his worth, and by their owne consent, To gouerne them, and workes the best he can T'aduance the Crowne, and giue the State c?tent; Commits not all to others care, nor ran An idle course, or on his Minions spent. “But, thus the Horse at first bites at the Bit; “That after is content to play with it. 78 Growne to a mighty powre (attending now Northumberland, with his prepared ayde) The Bishop (by a parle) is, with a showe Of combination, cunningly betrayde By Westmerland: whose wit did ouerthrowe, Without a sword, all these great feares, and stayd The mightiest danger, that did euer yet Thy Crowne and State, disturbed Henrie, threat. 79 For which, this reuerent Priest with Mowbray dyes: Who both, drawne on, with passion of despight, To vndertake this fatall enterprise (The one his brothers bloud-shed to requite; The other for his fathers iniuries) Did wrong themselues, and did not others right. For, who through th'eyes of their affections looke, And not of iudgement, thus are ouer-tooke. 80 Whereof, when newes came to Northumberland (Who seldome other then of miserie Seemes borne to heare; being euer behind hand With Fortune, and his opportunitie) To Scotland flies: where, giuen to vnderstand Of some intrapment by conspiracie, Gets into VVales: whence hee aduentured T'attempt another day; and lost his head. 81 Whereby, once more those Parts are quieted, When-as the King (who neuer had his brow Seene free from sweat, nor hart from trouble rid) Was, with suspicion that his sonne grew now Too popular, and forward, so much fed By wicked instruments (who well knew how To gaine by Princes feares) as he thereby Fell, in his griefe, to great extreamitie. 82 Which when that vertuous Prince (who borne to bee The module of a glorious Monarch) heard, With humble protestations did so free His fathers feares, and his owne honor cleer'd, As that he plainely made the world to see How base, Detraction and Deceipt appeard; And that a hart, so nobly built, could not Containe (within) a thought, that wore a blot. 83 Wherewith, the king betakes him to some peace; Yet to a peace, much like a sicke-mans sleep (Whose vnrelenting paines do neuer cease; But alwayes watch vpon his weakenes keepe) That neuer any Sabaoth of release Could free his trauailes, and afflictions deepe: But still his cares held working, all his life, Till Death concludes a finall end with strife. 84 Whose Herald, Sickenes, being imployd, before, With full commission to denounce his end; And paine and griefe, inforcing more and more, Besieg'd the Hold, that could not long defend; Consuming so, al that resisting store Of those prouisions Nature daign'd to lend, As that the walles, worne thin, permit the Minde To looke out thorow, and his frailty finde. 85 For, now (as if those vapors vanisht were, Which heat of boyling bloud, and health, did breed, To clowd the iudgement) things do plaine appeare In their owne colours, as they are indeede; When-as th'illightned soule discouers cleere Th'abusing shewes of Sense, and notes with heed How poore a thing is pride; when all, as slaues, “Differ but in their fetters, not their Graues. 86 And, lying on his last afflicted bed, Pale Death and Conscience both before him stand; Th'one holding out a Booke, wherein he read In bloudy lines the deedes of his owne hand: The other shewes a glasse, which figured An ougly forme of foule corrupted Sand; Both bringing horror in the hiest degree, With what he was, and what he soone should be. 87 Which seeing; all trembling, and confus'd with feare, He lay a while, amaz'd, with this affright: At last, commands some, that attending were, To fetch the Crowne, and set it in his sight. On which, with fixed eye, and heauy cheere, Casting a looke; O God, sayth he, what right I had to thee, I now in griefe conceiue: Thee, which with blood I held, with horror leaue. 88 And, herewithall, the soule (rapt with the thought Of mischiefes past) did so attentiue wey These present terrors, whil'st (as if forgot) The dull oppressed body senselesse lay; That he, as breathlesse quite, quite dead is thought; When, lo, the sonne comes in, and takes-away This fatall Crowne from thence, and out he goes; As if impatient, longer time to lose. 89 To whom (call'd backe for this presumptuous deed) The King (return'd from out his extasie) “Began: O sonne, what needst thou make such speed “To be before-hand with thy miserie? “Thou shalt haue time ynough, if thou succeed, “To feele the stormes that beat on Dignitie. “And, if thou couldst but bee (be any thing) “In libertie, then neuer be a King. 90 “Nay, Father; since your Fortune did attaine “So high a Stand, I meane not to descend, “Replyes the Prince: as if what you did gaine, “I were of spirit vnable to defend. “Time will appease them well, who now complaine, “And ratifie our int'rest in the end. “What wrong hath not continuance quite out-worne? “Yeares make that right, which neuer was so borne. 91 “If so; God worke his pleasure, fayd the King: “Yet thou must needs contend, with all thy might, “Such euidence of vertuous deeds to bring, “That well may proue our wrong to be our right: “And let the goodnesse of the managing “Raze out the blot of foul attaining, quite; “That Discontent may all aduantage misse, “To wish it otherwise, then now it is. 92 “And since my death my purpose doth preuent, “Touching this Holy warre I tooke in hand “(An action wherewithall my soule had ment “T'appease my God, and reconcile my Land) “To thee is left to finish my intent; “Who, to be safe, must neuer idly stand; “But some great actions entertaine thou still, “To holde their mindes, who else wil practise ill. 93 “Thou hast not that aduantage by my Raigne, “To ryot it, as they whom long descent “Hath purchas't loue, by custome; but, with paine “Thou must contend to buy the worlds content. “What their birth gaue them, thou hast yet to gaine “By thine owne vertues, and good gouernment: “So that vnlesse thy worth confirme the thing, “Thou neuer shalt be father to a King. 94 “Nor art thou borne in those calme dayes, where Rest “Hath brought asleepe sluggish Securitie: “But, in tumultuous times; where mindes, addrest “To factions, are invr'd to mutinie; “A mischiefe, not by force, to be supprest, “Where rigor still begets more enmitie: “Hatred must be beguil'd with some new course, “Where States are stiffe, and Princes doubt their force. 95 This, and much more, Affliction would haue say'd, Out of th'experience of a troublous Raigne (For which, his high desire had dearely pay'd The int'rest of an euer-toyling paine) But that this all-subduing Power here stai'd His fault'ring tongue, and paine (r'inforc't againe) Barr'd vp th'oppressed passages of breath, To bring him quite vnder the state of Death. 96 In whose possession I must leaue him now; And now, into the Ocean of new toyles; Into the stormie Maine (where tempestes growe Of greater ruines, and of greater spoyles) Set foorth my course (to hasten-on my vow) Ov'r all the troublous Deepe of these turmoyles, And, if I may but liue t'attaine the shore Of my desired end, I wish no more. The ende of the fourth Booke. THE FIFT BOOKE. THE ARGVMENT. Henry the fift cuts off his enemie, The Earle of Cambridge, that conspir'd his death. Henry the sixt (married vnluckily) His, and his Countryes glorie ruineth. Suffolke, that made the match, preferd too hie, Going to exile, a Pirat murthereth. VVhat meanes the Duke of Yorke obseru'd to gaine The worlds good-will, seeking the Crowne t'attaine. 1 Close smothered lay the lowe depressed fire, Whose after-issuing flames confounded all, The whil'st victorious Henry did conspire The wracke of Fraunce, that at his feete did fall: Whil'st ioyes of gotten spoyles, and new desire Of greater gaine, to greater deeds did call His conquering troupes; that could no thoughts retaine, Saue thoughts of glorie, all that actiue Raigne. 2 Whome here, me thinks (as if hee did appeare, Out of the clowdy darkenes of the night) I do behold approche with Martiall cheere, And with a dreadful (and yet louely) sight: Whose eye giues courage, and whose brow hath feare; Both representing terror, and delight; And stayes my course, and off my purpose breakes, And in vpbrayding words thus fiercely speakes: 3 “Vngrateful times, that impiously neglect “That worth, that neuer times againe shall shew; “What? merites all our toyle no more respect? “Or else standes Idlenesse asham'd to knowe “Those wondrous Actions that do so obiect “Blame to the wanton, sinne vnto the slowe? “Can England see the best, that she can boast, “Lie thus vngrac't, vndeckt and almost lost? 4 “Why do you seeke for fained Palladines “(Out of the smoke of idle vanitie) “Who may giue glory to the true designes, “Of Bourchier, Talbot, Neuile, Willoughby? “Why should not you striue to fill vp your lines, “With wonders of your owne, with veritie? “T'inflame their ofspring with the loue of good, “And glorious true examples of their Blood. 5 “What euerlasting matter here is found, “Whence new immortall Iliads might proceed! “That those, whose happie graces do abound “In blessed accents, here may haue to feed “Good thoughts; on no imaginarie ground “Of hungry shadowes, which no profite breed; “Whence, musicke-like, instant delight may growe; “Yet, when men all do knowe, they nothing knowe. 6 “And why dost thou, in lamentable verse, “Nothing but blood-shed, treasons, sinne and shame, “The worst of times, th'extreame of ills, rehearse; “To rayse olde staynes, and to renew dead blame? “As if the mindes of th'euill, and peruerse, “Were not farre sooner trained from the same, “By good example of faire vertuous acts, “Then by the shew of foul vngodly facts. 7 “Would God, our times had had some sacred wight, “Whose words as happy as our swords had bin, “To haue prepar'd for vs Tropheis aright, “Of vndecaying frames t'haue rested in; “Triumphant Arks, of perdurable might; “O holy lines! that such aduantage win “Vpon the Sieth of Time, in spight of yeares: “How blessed they, who gaine what neuer weares! 8 “For, what is it to do, if what we do “Shall perish neere as soone as it is donne? “What is that glory wee attaine vnto “With all our toyle, if lost as soone as wonne? “A small requitall, for so great adoo, “Is this poore present breath, a smoake soone gone; “Or these dumb stones, erected for our sake: “Which, formless heapes few stormy changes make. 9 “Tell great ELIZA (since her dayes are grac't, “With those bright ornaments, to vs deni'd) “That she repaire what darknesse hath defac't, “And get our ruyn'd deedes, reedifi'd: “She in whose all-directing eye is plac't “A powre, the highest powers of wit to guide; “Shee may command the worke, and ouer-see “The holy frame, that might eternall bee. 10 For, would Shee be content, that Time should make A rauenous prey, vpon her glorious Raigne; That Darkenesse, and the Night, should ouertake So cleare a Brightnesse, shining without staine? Ah! no: She fosters some (no doubt) that wake For her eternitie, with pleasing paine. And if shee, for her selfe, prepare this good; Let her not so neglect those of her Blood. 11 This, that great Monarch, Henrie, seem'd to craue; When (weighing what a holy motiue here Vertue propos'd, and fit for him to haue, Whom all times ought of dutie hold most deare) I sigh't, and wish't that some would take t'ingraue, With curious hand, so proud a worke to reare (To grace the present, and to blesse times past) That might, for euer, to our glorie last. 12 So should our well-taught times haue learn'd alike, How faire shin'd Virtue, and how foul Vice stood; When now my selfe am driuen to mislike Those deedes of worth, I dare not vow for good: I cannot mone who lose, nor prayse who seeke By mightie Actions here t'aduance their Blood, I must say, Who wrought most, least honor had: How euer good the Cause, the deedes were bad. 13 And onely tell the worst of euerie Raigne; And not the intermedled good report. I leaue, what glorie Virtue did attaine At th'euer memorable Agincort: I leaue to tell, what wit, what power did gaine Th'assieged Roan, Caen, Dreux; or in what sort: How Maiestie, with terror, did aduance Her conquering foote, on all subdued Fraunce. 14 All this I passe, and that magnanimous King, Mirror of vertue, miracle of worth; Whose mighty Actions, with wise managing, Forc't prouder boasting Climes to serue the North. The best of all the best, the earth can bring, Scarce equals him, in what his Raigne brought foorth; Being of a minde, as forward to aspire, As fit to gouerne what he did desire. 15 His comely body was a goodly seate, Where Virtue dwelt most faire; as lodg'd most pure: A body strong; where vse of strength did get A stronger state to do, and to endure: His life he makes th'example, to beget Like spirit in those, he did to good inure; And gaue, to Worth, such life, and liuelihood, As if hee Greatnes sought, but to do good. 16 Hee as the Chiefe, and all-directing head, Did with his subiects, as his members, liue; And them to goodnesse forced not, but led; Winning, not much to haue, but much to giue (Deeming, the powre of his, his powr did spread) As borne to blesse the world, and not to grieue; Adorn'd with others spoyles, not subiects store: No King, exacting lesse; none, winning more. 17 Hee, after that corrupted faith had bred An ill inur'd obedience for Command; And languishing luxuriousnes had spred Weyward vnaptnesse ouer all the Land; Those long vnordred troupes so marshalled, Vnder such formall discipline to stand, That euen his soule seem'd onely to direct So great a body, such exployts t'effect. 18 He brings abrode distracted Discontent; Disperst ill humors into actions hie; And, to vnite them all in one consent, Plac't the faire marke of glorie in their eye; That, Malice had no leasure to dissent, Nor Enuie time to practise treacherie: The present actions do diuert the thought Of madnesse past, while mindes were so well wrought. 19 Here now were Pride, Oppression, Vsurie (The canker-eating mischiefes of the State) Call'd foorth to prey vpon the enemie; Whil'st the home-burth'ned, better lightned sate: Exactors did not, with a greedy eye, Examine states, or priuate riches rate: The silent Courts warr'd not, with busie words; Nor wrested law gaue the contentious, swords. 20 Now, nothing entertaines th'attentiue eare, But stratagems, assaults, surprises, fightes; How to giue lawes to them that conquered were, How to articulate with yeelding wightes: The weake with mercie, and the proud with feare, How to retaine; to giue deserts their rights, Were now the Artes: and nothing else was thought, But how to win, and maintaine what was got. 21 Nor here were any priuately possest Or held alone imprisoned Maiestie, Proudly debarring entraunce from the rest; As if the prey were theirs, by victorie. Here, no detractor woundes who merits best; Nor shameless brow cheeres-on impietie. Vertue, who all her toyle with zeale had spent, Not here, all vnrewarded, sighing went. 22 But, here, the equally-respecting eye Of Powre, looking alike on like deserts, Blessing the good, made others good thereby; More mightie, by the multitude of hearts. The fielde of glorie, vnto all doth lie Open alike; honour, to all imparts. So that the onely fashion in request, Was, to be good, or good-like, as the rest. 23 So much, ô thou Example, dost effect (Being farre a better Maister, then Command) That, how to do, by doing dost direct, And teachest others action, by thy hand. “Who followes not the course, that kings elect? “When Princes worke, who then wil idle stand? “And, when that dooing good is onely thought “Worthy reward; who will be bad for nought? 24 And had not th'Earle of Cambridge, with vaine speed Vntimely practiz'd for an others right, With hope to aduance those of his proper seed (On whome the Rule seem'd destined to light) The Land had seene none of her owne to bleed, During this Raigne, nor no aggreeued sight; None the least blacknesse interclouded had So faire a day, nor any eye lookt sad. 25 But now, when Fraunce perceiued (from afarre) The gathering tempest, growing-on from hence, Ready to fall, threatning their State to marre, They labour all meanes to prouide defence: And, practising how to preuent this warre, And shut-out such calamities from thence, Do foster, here, some discord lately growne; To hold Ambition busied, with her owne. 26 Finding those humors which they saw were fit Soone to be wrought, and easie to be fed, Swolne full with enuie, that the Crowne should sit There where it did (as if established) And whom it toucht in Blood, to grieue at it; They with such hopes and helps sollicited, That this great Earle was drawne t'attempt the thing, And practiseth how to depose the King. 27 For, being of mightie meanes to do the deed; And yet of mightier hopes, then meanes to do: And yet of spirit, that did his hopes exceed; And then of Blood as great, to adde thereto: All these, with what the gold of France could breed (Being powers enow a clyming minde to woo) He so imploy'd, that many he had wonne, Euen of the chiefe the King reli'd vpon. 28 The well-knowne right of th'Earle of March allur'd A leaning loue: whose Cause he did pretend. Whereby, he knew that so himselfe procur'd The Crowne for his owne children, in the ende. For, the Earle beeing (as hee was assur'd) Vnapt for issue, it must needes descend On those of his, being next of Clarence race; As who, by course of right, should hold the place. 29 It was the time, when-as the forward Prince Had all prepar'd for his great enterprize; And ready stand his troupes to part from hence, And all in stately forme and order lyes, When open Fame giues out intelligence Of these bad complots of his enemies: Or else, this time (of purpose) chosen is; Though knowne before; yet let run-on, till this. 30 That this might yeeld the more to aggrauate Vpon so foul a deed vntimely sought, Now at this point, t'attempt to ruinate So glorious a designe so forward brought, Whil'st careful Virtue seekes t'aduance the State, And for her euerlasting honor sought: That though the Cause seem'd right, and title strong; The time of dooing it, yet makes it wrong. 31 But, straight, an vnlamented death he had: And straight were ioyfully the Anchors weighd: And all flocke fast aboord, with visage glad; As if the sacrifice had nowe beene payd, For their good speed; that made their stay so sad, Loathing the least occasion that delayd. And, now, new thoughts, great hopes, calme seas, fair windes, With present action intertaine their mindes. 32 No other crosse, ô Henry, saw thy dayes But this, that toucht thy now possessed hold; Nor after, long, till this mans sonne assayes To get, of thine, the right that he controll'd: For which, contending long, his life he payes. So that, it fatal seem'd the father should Thy winning seeke to stay, and then his sonne Should be the cause to lose, when thou hadst won. 33 Yet now in this so happy a meane-while, And interlightning times, thy Virtues wrought, That Discord had no leasure to defile So faire attempts with a tumultuous thought: And euen thy selfe, thy selfe didst so beguile With such attention vpon what was sought, That time affoords not now with feare or hate Others to seeke, thee to secure thy State. 34 Or else, how easie had it beene, for thee, All the pretendant race t'haue layd full lowe? If thou proceeded hadst with crueltie, Not suffering any fatall branch to growe: But vnsuspicious Magnanimitie Shames such effectes of feare, and force, to showe; Busied in free and open Actions still Being great: for, being good, hates to be ill. 35 And yet, such wrongs are held meete to be done, And often for the State thought requisite: As, when the publike good depends thereon, When great iniustice is esteem'd great right: But yet, what good with doing ill is won? Who hath of blood made such a benefite, As hath not fear'd, more after then before, And made his peace the lesse, his plague the more? 36 Farre otherwise dealt this vndaunted King, That cherished the ofspring of his foes; And his Competitors to grace did bring: And them, his friendes for Armes, and honors, chose; As if plaine courses were the safest thing; Where vpright goodnesse, sure, and stedfast goes, Free from that subtile maskt impietie, Which this depraued world calles policie. 37 Yet, how hath Fate dispos'd of all this good? What haue these Virtues after times auail'd? In what stead hath hy-raised Valour stood, When this continuing cause of Greatnes fail'd? Then, when proud-growne, the irritated blood, Enduring not it selfe, it selfe assail'd; As though that Prowesse had but learnd to spill Much blood abrode, to cut her throat with skill. 38 How doth th'Eternall, in the course of things, Immix the causes both of Good and Ill? That thus the one, effects of th'other brings: As what seemes made to blisse, is borne to spill? What? from the best of Virtues glorie, springs That, which the world with miserie doth fill? Is th'end of happinesse, but wretchednesse? Hath Sinne his plague, and Virtue no successe? 39 Either that is not good, the world holdes good: Or else is so confus'd with ill; that we (Abused with th'appearing likelihood) Run to offend, whil'st we thinke good to bee: Or else the heauens made man (in furious blood) To torture man; Allotting no course free From mischiefe long: Sending faire dayes that breed But stormes; to make, more foul, times that succeed. 40 Who would haue thought, that so great victories, Such conquests, riches, Land, and Kingdome gain'd, Could not but haue establisht in such wise This powrefull State, in state to haue remain'd? Who would haue thought, that Mischiefe could deuise A way, so soone to lose what was attain'd? As if powre were but shew'd to grieue, not grace; And to reduce vs into farre worse case. 41 With what contagion, Fraunce, didst thou infect This Land, by thee made proud, to disagree; T'inrage them so, their owne swordes to direct Vpon them-selues, that were made sharp in thee? Why didst thou teach them, here at home t'erect Trophees of their blood, which of thine should bee? Or was the date of thine affliction out, And so (by course) was ours to come about? 42 But, that vntimely death of this great King, Whose nine yeeres Raigne so mightie wonders wrought, To thee thy hopes, to vs despaire did bring; Not long to keepe, and gouerne, what was got: For, those that had th'affayres in managing, Although their Countries good they greatly sought; Yet, so ill accidentes vnfitly fell, That their dessignes could hardly prosper wel. 43 An infant King doth in the State succeed, Scarce one yeere old; left vnto others guide: Whose careful trust, though such as shew'd indeed, They weigh'd their charge more then the world beside, And did with dutie, zeale, and loue proceed; Yet (for all what their trauaile could prouide) Could not woo Fortune, to remaine with vs, When this her Minion was departed thus: 44 But, by degrees first this, then that, regain'd, The turning tide beares backe, with flowing chaunce Vnto the Dolphin, all we had attain'd, And filles the late lowe-running hopes of Fraunce; When Bedford (who our onely hold maintain'd) Death takes from vs, their fortune to aduance: And then home-strife (that on it selfe did fall) Neglecting forraine care, did soone lose all. 45 Neere three score yeeres are past since Bullingbrooke Did first attaine (God knows how iust) the Crowne: And now his race, for right possessors tooke, Were held of all, to hold nought but their owne: When Richard, Duke of Yorke, begins to looke Into their right, and makes his title knowne; Wakening-vp sleeping Right (that lay as dead) To witnesse, how his race was iniured. 46 His fathers end, in him, no feare could moue T'attempt the like, against the like of might; Where long possession now of feare, and loue, Seem'd to prescribe euen an innated Right. So that, to proue his state, was to disproue Time, law, consent, oath, and allegeance quight: And no way, but the way of blood there was, Through which, with all confusion hee must passe. 47 And how much better for him, had it beene, T'indure a wrong with peace, then with such toyle “T'obtaine a bloody Right? since Right is sinne, “That is ill sought, and purchased with spoyle. But, this so wretched state are Kingdomes in, Where one mans Cause, shall all the rest imbroyle: And oft, t'aduance a Tyran to a Crowne, Men run t'vndoo the State, that is their owne. 48 And yet that opportunitie, which led Him to attempt, seemes likewise him t'excuse: A feeble spirited King that gouerned, (Who ill could guide the Scepter he did vse) His enemies (that his worth maliced; Who, both the Land, and him, did much abuse) The peoples loue, and his apparant Right, May seeme sufficient motiues to incite. 49 Besides; the now ripe wrath (deferd till now) Of that sure and vnfayling Iusticer, That neuer suffers wrong so long to growe, And to incorporate with right so farre, As it might come to seeme the same in showe (T'incourage those that euill minded are By such successe) but that at last he will Confound the branch, whose root was planted ill. 50 Else, might the impious say (with grudging spight) Doth God permit the Great to riot free, And blesse the mightie though they do vnright, As if he did unto their wrongs agree? And onely plague the weake and wretched wight, For smallest faults, euen in the high'st degree? When he, but vsing them for others scourge, Likewise of them at l?gth the world doth purge. 51 But could not yet, for blood-shed, satisfie The now well-ruling of th'ill-gotten Crowne? Must euen the good receiue the penaltie Of former sinnes, that neuer were their owne? And must a iust King's blood, with miserie Pay for a bad, vniustly ouerthrowne? Well; then wee see, Right in his course must goe: And men, t'escape from blood, must keepe it so. 52 And, sure, this King, that now the Crowne possest (Henrie the sixt) was one, whose life was free From that command of vice, whereto the rest Of most these mightie Soueraignes subiects bee; And numbred might haue beene, among the best Of other men, if not of that degree: A right good man, but yet an euill King; Vnfit for what hee had in managing. 53 Of humble spirite, of nature continent: No thought t'increase he had; scarce keep his owne: For pard'ning apter, then for punishment, He chokes his powre, to haue his bountie knowne. Farre from reuenge, soone wonne, soone made content; As fitter for a Cloyster then a Crowne: Whose holy minde so much addicted is On th'world to-come, that he neglecteth this. 54 With such a weake-good, feeble-godly King, Hath Richard, Duke of Yorke, his Cause to trie: Who, by th'experience of long managing The warres of Fraunce, with supreame dignitie; And by his owne great worth, with furthering The common good against the enemie, Had wrought, that zeale and loue attend his might, And made his spirit equall vnto his Right. 55 For, now the Duke of Bedford beeing dead, He is ordain'd the Regent to succeed In Fraunce, for fiue yeeres: where, he trauayled With ready hand, and with as carefull heed, To seeke to turne backe Fortune (that now fled) And hold vp falling Power, in time of need: And got and lost, and reattaines (againe) That which againe was lost, for all his paine. 56 His time expir'd, he should for fiue yeeres more Haue had his charge prolong'd: but Sommerset, (That still had enui'd his command before) That place, and honor, for himselfe did get: Which ads that matter to th'already store Of kindled hate, which such a fire doth set Vnto the touch of a confounding flame, As both their bloods could neuer quench the same. 57 And now the weakenesse of that feeble Head (That doth neglect all care, but his soules care) So easie meanes of practice ministred, Vnto th'ambitious members, to prepare Their owne desires, to what their humors led; That all good actions coldly followed are, And sev'rall-tending hopes do wholly bend To other now, then to the publique end. 58 And, to draw on more speedy miserie, The King vnto a fatall match is led With Rayners daughter, King of Sicilie; Whom, with vnlucky starres, he married: For, by the meanes of this affinitie, Was lost all that his father conquered; Euen as if France had some Erynnis sent T'auenge their wrongs, done by the insolent. 59 This marriage was the Earle of Suffolkes deed, With great rewardes won to effect the same: Which made him that hee tooke so little heed Vnto his Countries good, or his owne shame: It beeing a match could stand vs in no steed For strength, for wealth, for reputation, fame: But cunningly contriv'd for others gaine; And cost vs more, then Aniou, Mauns, and Maine. 60 And yet (as if he had accomplished Some mightie benefit vnto the Land) He got his trauailes to be registred In Parlement, for euermore to stand A witnes to approue all what he did: To th'end, that, if hereafter it were scand, Authoritie might yet be on his side; As doing nought but what was ratifi'd: 61 Imagining, th'allowance of that Place Would make that good, the which he knew was naught; And so would his negotiation grace, As none might think it was his priuate fault. Wherein, though wit dealt wary in this case; Yet, in the end, it selfe it ouer-raught. Striuing to hide, he opened it the more; His after-care, shewd craft had gone before. 62 Deare didst thou buy, ô King, so faire a Wife, So rare a spirit, so high a minde, the-while: Whose portion was destruction; dowry, strife: Whose bed was sorrow; whose embracing, spoyle: Whose maintenance cost thee and thine, their life; And whose best comfort, neuer was but toyle. What Paris brought this booty of desire, To set our mightie Ilium here on fire? 63 I grieue, I should be forc't to say thus much, To blame her, whom I yet must wonder at; Whose so sweete beautie, wit, and worth, were such, As (though she Fortune lost) she glory gat: Yet doth my Countries zeale so neerely touch, That here my Muse it doth exasperate; Although vnwilling, that my pen should giue Staine to that sex, by whom her fame doth liue. 64 For, sure, those virtues well deserv'd a Crowne. And, had it not beene ours, no doubt she might Haue beene among the Worthies of renowne, And now sat faire with fame, with glorie bright: But, comming in the way where sinne was growne So foule and thicke, it was her chaunce to light Amidst the grosse infection of those times; And so came stain'd with black disgrace-full crimes. 65 For, some the world must haue, on whom to lay The heauie burthen of reproche and blame; Against whose deedes, th'afflicted may inuay, As th'onely Authors, whence destruction came: When yet, perhaps, 'twas not in them to stay The current of that streame, nor help the same; But, liuing in the eye of Action so, Not hindring it, are thought to draw-on wo. 66 So much vnhappie do the Mightie stand, Who stand on other then their owne defence, When-as destruction is so neere at hand, That if by weakenesse, folly, negligence, They do not coming miserie withstand, They shall be deemed th'authors of th'offence, And to call in, that which they kept not out; And curst, as they who brought those plagues about. 67 And so remaine for euer rigistred In that eternall booke of Infamie; When yet how many other causes led As well to that, as their iniquitie? The worst complots oft lie close smothered: And well-meant deedes fall out vnluckily; Whil'st the aggrieu'd stand not to waigh th'intent; But euer iudge according to th'euent. 68 I say not this t'excuse thy Sinne, ô Queene, Nor cleare their faults who mightie Actors are: I cannot but affirme, thy pride hath been A speciall meanes this Common-wealth to marre: And that thy weyward will was plainely seene, In vaine ambition, to presume too farre; And that, by thee, the onely way was wrought The Duke of Gloster to his death was brought: 69 A man, though seeming in thy thought to sit Betweene the light of thy desires and thee; Yet did his taking thence plainely permit Others to looke to that they could not see During his life, nor would aduenture it: When his Remoue quite made the passage free; That, by his fall, thinking to stand alone, Thou scarce could'st stand at all, when he was gone. 70 For, this Duke (as Protector) many yeeres, Had rul'd the Land, during the Kings young age; And now the selfe same charge and title beares, As if hee still were in his pupillage: Which, such disgrace vnto the Queene appeares, That (all incenst, with an ambitious rage) Shee doth conspire to haue him made-away; As one, that stayd the Current of her sway: 71 Thrust thereinto, not onely with her pride; But, by her fathers counsell and consent: Who griev'd likewise, that any one beside, Should haue the honor of the gouernment: And, therefore, he such deepe aduice appli'd, As forraine craft and cunning could inuent, To circumuent an vnsuspecting wight, Before he should discerne of their despight. 72 And many ready hands shee straight doth finde, To ayde her deed, of such as could not brooke The length of one mans office, in that kind; Who, all th'especiall Charges vnder-tooke, Rul'd all, himselfe: and neuer had the minde T'impart a part with others; who would looke To haue likewise some honor in their hands, And griev'd at such ingrossing of Commands. 73 For, had he not had such a greedy loue To intertaine his Offices too long, Enuie had beene vnable to reproue His acted life, vnless shee did him wrong: But, hauing liv'd, so many yeeres, aboue, He grieues now to descend, to be lesse strong, And kils that fame that virtue did beget; Chose to be held lesse good, then seene lesse great. 74 “For, could the mightie but giue bounds to pride, “And weigh-backe Fortune, ere shee pull Them downe; “Contented with inough, with honors satisfi'd, “Not striuing how to make so much their owne, “As to leaue nothing for the rest beside; “Who seeme by their high-spreading ouer-growne “(Whil'st they themselues remaine in all mens sight, “The odious marke of hatred and despight) 75 “Then neuer should so many tragedies “Burthen our knowledge, with their bloody end: “Nor their disgrac't confounded families, “From so high pride, to so lowe shame descend; “But, planted on that ground where safetie lyes, “Their braunches should to eternitie extend: “But euer, they, who ouer-looke so much, “Will ouer-see themselues; their state is such. 76 Seuere he was, and strictly did obserue Due forme of Iustice towards euery wight; Vnmoueable, and neuer won to swerue For any cause, in what he thought was right: Wherein, although he did so well deserue; In the licentious, yet, it bred despight: “So that euen Virtue seemes an Actor too, “To ruine those, Fortune prepares t'vndoo. 77 Now, such, being forward, who (the Queene well knewe) Hated his might, and glad to innouate; Vnto so great, and strong a partie grew, As it was easie to subuert his State: And onely hope of alteration drew Many to yeeld, that had no cause to hate. “For, euen with goodnesse men growe discontent, “Where States are ripe to fall, and virtue spent. 78 And, taking all the Rule into her hand (Vnder the shadow of that feeble King) The Duke sh'excludes from Office and Command, And in the reach of enmitie doth bring, From that respected height where he did stand (When malice scarce durst mutter any thing): And now the worst of him comes all reueal'd, Which former feare, or rigor kept conceal'd. 79 Now is he taxèd, that he rather sought His priuate profit, then the publique good; And many things presumptuously had wrought; Other, then with our lawes, and customes stood: As one, that would into the Land haue brought The Ciuile forme, in cases touching blood; And such poore Crimes: that shew'd, their spight was so?d; But yet bewrayde, their matter wanted ground. 80 Yet serv'd they well the turne, and did effect That which is easie wrought in such a case: Where, what suborned Iustice shal obiect, Is to the purpose, and must passe with grace; And what the wretched bring, of no effect: Whose haynous faultes his matter must deface. “For, where Powre hath decreed to finde th'offence, “The Cause is better still, then the defence. 81 A Parlement, at Berry summoned, Dispatcht the deed, more speedily then well. For, thither came the Duke without all dread, Or ought imagining of what befell: Where, now the matter is so followed, That he conuented is, ere he could tell He was in danger, or had done offence; And presently to prison sent, from thence. 82 Which quicke, and sodaine action gaue no time For men to waigh the iustice of the deed; Whil'st looking onely on the vrged crime, Vnto the farther drift they take no heed. For, these occasions taken in the prime Of courses new, that old dislikes succeed, Leaue not behind that feeling touch of wrong: Satietie makes passions still lesse strong. 83 And yet they seem'd some mutinie to doubt, For thus proceeding with a man of might; Consid'ring hee was popular and stout, And resolute would stand upon his Right: And therefore did they cast this way about, To haue him closely murdred out of sight; That so, his trouble, and his death hereby, Might come togither, and togither die: 84 Reckning it better, since his end is ment, And must be wrought, at once to rid it cleere, And put it to the fortune of th'euent; Then by long doing, to be long in feare: When, in such courses of high punishment, The deed, and the attempt, like daunger beare: And oft, things done (perhaps) do lesse annoy, Then may the doing, handled with delay. 85 And, so, they had it straight accomplished. For, next day after his commitment, he Is dead brought forth; being found so in his bed: Which was by sodaine sickenesse sayd to bee, That had vpon his sorrowes newly bred; As by apparant tokens men might see. And thus ô Sickenesse, thou art oft beli'd; When death hath many wayes to come, beside. 86 Are these the deedes, high forraine wittes inuent? Is this that Wisedome whereof they so boast? Well; then I would it neuer had beene spent Heere, amongst vs, nor brought from out their coast: Let their vile cunning, in their limits pent, Remaine amongst themselues, that like it most: And let the North (they count of colder blood) Be held more grosse, so it remaine more good. 87 Let them haue fairer citties, goodlier soyles, And sweeter fieldes, for beautie to the eye, So long as they haue these vngodly wyles, Such detestable vile impietie: And let vs want their Vines, their Fruites the-whyles, So that wee want not fayth and honestie: We care not for those pleasures; so we may Haue better hearts, and stronger hands then they. 88 Neptune, keepe-out, from thy imbraced Ile, This foul contagion of iniquitie: Drowne all corruptions, comming to defile Our faire proceedings ordred formally: Keepe vs meere English: let not craft beguile Honor and Iustice, with strange subtiltie: Let vs not thinke, how that our good can frame, Which ruin'd hath the Authors of the same. 89 But, by this impious meanes, that worthy man Is brought vnto this lamentable end, And, now, that Current with maine furie ran (The stop remov'd, that did the course defend) Vnto the full of mischiefe, that began T'a vniuersall ruine to extend; That Isthmus fayling, which the Land did keep, From the intire possession of the Deepe. 90 And now the King, alone, all open lay; No vnder-prop of Blood, to stay him by. None, but himselfe stands weakely in the way Twixt Yorke, and the affected sov'raignty: Gone is that barre, that would haue beene the stay T'haue kept him backe, from mounting vp so hie. “But see (ah!) see: What state stand these men in, “That cannot liue without, nor with their kin? 91 The Queene hath yet, by this, her full desire; And now she with her Minion, Suffolke, raigns: Now she hath all authoritie intire; And all affayres vnto her selfe retains: And onely Suffolke is aduaunced hier, He is the man rewarded, for his pains; He, that did her in stead most chiefly stand; And more aduanc't her, then hee did the Land. 92 Which when they saw, who better did expect, Then they began their error to descry; And well perceiue, that onely the defect Was in their iudgements, passion-drawne awry; Found, formall rigor fitter to direct, Then pride and insolent inconstancie. “Better seueritie, that's right and iust, “Then impotent affections, led with lust. 93 And thereupon, in sorrow thus complaine; “What wondrous inconuenience do they feele, “Where as such imbecillitie doth raigne, “As so neglects the care of Common-weale? “Where euer one or other doth obtaine “So high a grace thus absolute to deale; “The-whilst th'aggreeued subiect suffers, stil, “The pride of some predominating will? 94 “And euer, one remov'd, a worse succeedes: “So that the best, that we can hope, is Warre, “Tumults, and stirres, that this disliking breedes: “The sword must mend, what Insolence doth marre. “For, what rebellions, and what bloody deedes, “Haue euer followed, where such courses are? “What oft-remoues? what death of Counsailers? “What murder? what exile of Officers? 95 “Witnesse the Spencers, Gauestone, and Vere, “The mighty Minions of our feeblest Kings; “Who euer Subiects to their subiects were, “And onely the procurers of these things: “When worthy Monarchs, that hold honour deare, “Maister themselues, and theirs; vvhich euer brings “That vniuersall reuerence, and respect: “For, who waighes him, that doth himselfe neglect? 96 “And yet our case is like to be farre worse: “Hauing a King, though not so bent to ill, “Yet so neglecting good, that giuing force “By giuing leaue, doth all good order kill; “Suffring a violent Woman take her course, “To manage all, according to her will: “Which, how she doth begin, her deedes expresse; “And, what will be the end, our selues may ghesse. 97 Which after followed, euen as they did dread, When now the shamefull losse of Fraunce, much grieues: Which vnto Suffolke is attributed: As who in all mens sight most hatefull liues: And is accus'd, that he (with lucre led) Betraies the State, and secret knowledge giues Of our designes; and, all that we did hold, By his corruption, is or lost, or sold. 98 And, as hee deales abroad, so likewise here, He robs at home, the Treasurie no lesse; Here, where he all authorities doth beare, And makes a Monopoly of Offices: He is inricht, h'is rais'd, and placèd neare; And onely he, giues counsaile to oppresse: Thus men obiect, whil'st many, vp in Armes, Offer to be reuengèd of these harmes. 99 The Queene, perceiuing in what case she stoode To lose her Minion, or ingage her State; (After with long contention in her blood, Loue and Ambition, did the Cause debate) Shee yields to Pride: and rather thought it good, To sacrifice her Loue vnto their hate; Then to aduenture else the losse of all: Which (by maintaining him) was like to fall. 100 Yet, seeking at the first to temporize, Shee tries if that some short Imprisonment Would calme their heat: when that would not suffize, Then to exile him she must needs consent; Hoping, that time would salue it in such wise, As yet at length they might become content, And shee againe, might haue him home at last, When this first furie of their rage was past. 101 But, as he to his iudged exile went, Hard on the shore he comes incountered By some, that so farre off his Honour sent, As put his backe-returne quite out of dread: For, there he had his rightfull punishment, Though wrongly done; and there he lost his head: Part of his blood hath Neptune, part the Sand; As who had mischiefe wrought by sea and land. 102 Whose death, when swift-wingd Fame at full conuaid To this disturbed Queene, misdoubting nought; Despight, and Sorrow such affliction laid Vpon her soule, as wondrous passions wrought. “And art thou Suffolke, thus, said she, betraid? “And haue my fauours thy destruction brought? “Is this their gaine, whom Highnesse fauoureth, “Who chiefe preferd, stand as preferd to death? 103 “O fatall grace! without which, men complaine, “And with it perish; what preuailes that we “Must weare the Crowne, and other men must raigne, “And cannot stand to be, that which we be? “Must our owne Subiects limit and constraine “Our fauours, wher-as they themselues decree? “Must we, our loue, at their appointment, place? “Do we commaund, and they direct our grace? 104 “Must they our powre, thus from our will, diuide? “And haue wee might, but must not vse our might? “Poore Maiestie, which other men must guide; “Whose discontent can neuer looke aright: “For, euer-more wee see those who abide “Gracious in ours, are odious in their sight, “Who would all-maistring Maiestie defeat “Of her best grace; that is, to make men Great. 105 “But, well; We see, although the King be Head, “The State will be the Heart. This Soueraigntie “Is but in place, not powre; and gouerned “By th'equall Scepter of Necessitie. “And we haue seene more Princes ruined, “By their imoderat fauouring priuatly, “Then by seuerity in generall. “For, best h'is lik't, that is alike to all. 106 Thus stormes this Lady, all disquieted; When-as farre greater tumults now burst out: Which close and cunningly were practiced, By such, as sought great hopes to bring about. For, vp in Armes in Kent were gathered A mighty insolent rebellious rout, Vnder a dangerous Head; who, to deterr The State the more, himselfe nam'd Mortimer. 107 The Duke of Yorke, that did not idle stand (But seekes to worke on all aduantages) Had likewise in this course a secret hand, And hartned on their chiefest complices; To try how here the people of the Land Would (if occasion serv'd) b'in readiness To aide that Line, if one should come in deed To moue his Right, and in due course proceed; 108 Knowing himselfe to be the onely one, That must attempt the thing, if any should: And therefore, lets the Rebell now run-on With that false Name, t'effect the best he could; To make a way for him to worke vpon, Who but on certaine ground aduenture would. For, if the Traitor sped, the gaine were his; If not, yet he stands safe, and blamelesse is. 109 T'attempt' with others dangers, not his owne, He counts it wisedome, if it could be wrought: And t'haue the humour of the people knowne, Was now that, which was chiefely to be sought. For, with the best, he knew himselfe was growne In such account, as made him take no thought; Hauing observ'd, in those he meant to proue, Their wit, their wealth, their cariage, and their loue. 110 With whome, and with his owne alliances, He first begins to open (in some wise) The Right he had; yet, with such doubtfulnes, As rather sorrow, then his drift descries: Complayning of his Countries wretchednes, In what a miserable case it lies; And how much it imports them to prouide For their defence, against this womans pride. 111 Then, with the discontented he doth deale, In sounding theirs, not vttering his intent; As be'ing aduis'd, not so much to reueale, Whereby they might be made againe content: But, when they grieued for the Common-weale, He doth perswade them to be patient, And to indure; there was no other course: Yet, so perswades, as makes their malice worse. 112 And then, with such as with the time did run, In most vpright opinion he doth stand; As one, that neuer crost what they begun, But seem'd to like that which they tooke in hand: Seeking all causes of offence to shun, Prayses the Rule, and blames th'vnruly Land; Works so with gifts, and kindely offices, That, euen of them, he serues his turne no lesse. 113 Then, as for those, who were his followers (Being all choyce men for virtues, or desearts) He so with grace, and benefits prefers, That he becomes the Monarch of their hearts. He gets the learned, for his Counsaylers; And cherishes all men of rarest parts: “To whom, good done, doth an impressi? strike “Of ioy and loue, in all that are alike. 114 And now, by meanes of th'intermitted warre, Many most valiant men, impov'rished, Onely by him fed and relieued are; Onely respected, grac't and honoured. Which let him in, vnto their hearts so farre, As they by him were wholly to be led. “He onely treads the sure and perfect path “To Greatnesse, who loue and opinion hath. 115 And, to haue one some certaine Prouince his, As the maine body that must worke the feate, Yorkeshire he chose, the place wherein he is By title, liuings, and possessions great. No Country hee preferres, so much as this: Here, hath his Bountie, her abiding seat: Here, is his Iustice, and relieuing hand, Ready to all, that in distresse do stand. 116 What with his tenants, seruants, followers, friends, And their alliances, and amities, All that Shire vniuersally attends His hand, held vp to any enterprize. And thus farre, Virtue with her power extends: The rest, touching th'euent, in Fortune lies. With which accomplements, so mightie growne, Forward he tends, with hope t'attaine a Crowne. The ende of the fift Booke. THE SIXT BOOKE. THE ARGVMENT. The bad successe of Cades rebellion: Yorkes open practise and conspiracie: His comming in, and his submission: Th'effect of Printing and Artillerie. Burdeux reuolts; craues our protection: Talbot, defending ours, dyes gloriously. The French warres end: and Yorke begins againe; And, at S. Albones, Sommerset is slaine. 1 The furious traine of that tumultuous rout, Whom close sub-ayding power, and good successe, Had made vnwisely proud, and fondly stout, Thrust headlong on, oppression to oppresse; And now, to fulnesse growne, boldly giue out, That they the publique wrongs meant to redresse: “Formelesse themselues, reforming doe pretend; “As if Confusion could Disorder mend. 2 And on they march, with their false-named Head, Of base and vulgar birth, though noble fayn'd: Who, puft with vaine desires, to London led His rash abused troupes, with shadowes train'd: When-as the King, thereof ascertainèd, Supposing some small power would haue restrain'd Disordred rage, sends with a simple crew Sir Humfrey Stafford; whom they ouer-threw. 3 Which so increast th'opinion of their might, That much it gaue to do, and much it wrought; Confirm'd their rage, drew on the vulgar wight, Call'd foorth the timorous, fresh partakers brought: For, many, though most glad their wrongs to right, Yet durst not venture their estates for nought: But, see'ing the Cause had such aduantage got, Occasion makes them stirre, that else would not. 4 So much he erres, that scornes, or else neglects The small beginnings of arysing broyles; And censures others, not his owne defects, And with a selfe-conceite himselfe beguiles; Thinking small force will compasse great effects, And spares at first to buy more costly toyles: “When true-obseruing prouidence, in warre, “Still makes her foes, farre stronger then they are. 5 Yet this good fortune, all their fortune mard; “Which, fooles by helping, euer doth suppresse. For, wareless insolence (whil'st vndebard Of bounding awe) runnes on to such excesse, That following lust, and spoyle, and blood, so hard, Sees not how they procure their owne distresse: The better, lothing courses so impure, Rather will like their wounds, then such a cure. 6 For, whil'st this wilde vnrained multitude (Led with an vnfore-seeing greedy mind Of an imagin'd good, that did delude Their ignorance, in their desires made blind) Ransacke the Cittie, and (with hands imbru'd) Run to all out-rage in th'extreamest kind; Heaping-vp wrath and horrour, more and more, They adde fresh guilt, to mischiefes done before. 7 And yet, se'ing all this sorting to no end, But to their owne; no promis'd ayde t'appeare; No such partakers as they did attend; Nor such successes as imagin'd were; Good men resolv'd, the present to defend; Iustice, against them with a brow seuere: Themselues, feard of themselues, tyr'd with excesse, “Found, mischiefe was no fit way to redresse. 8 And as they stand in desperat comberment, Enuirond round with horror, blood, and shame: Crost of their course, despayring of th'euent A pardon (that smooth bait for basenesse) came: Which (as a snare, to catch the impotent) Beeing once pronounc't, they straight imbrace the same: And, as huge snowy Mountaines melt with heat; So they dissolv'd with hope, and home they get: 9 Leauing their Captaine to discharge, alone, The shot of blood, consumed in their heate: Too small a sacrifice, for mischiefs done, Was one mans breath, which thousands did defeat. Vnrighteous Death, why art thou but all one Vnto the small offender and the great? Why art thou not more then thou art, to those That thousands spoyle, and thousands liues do lose? 10 This furie, passing with so quick an end, Disclos'd not those that on th'aduantage lay: Who, seeing the course to such disorder tend, With-drew their foote, asham'd to take that way; Or else preuented, whil'st they did attend Some mightier force, or for occasion stay: But, what they meant, ill-fortune must not tell; Mischiefe be'ing oft made good, by speeding well. 11 Put-by from this, the Duke of Yorke dessignes Another course to bring his hopes about: And, with those friends affinitie combines In surest bonds, his thoughts he poureth-out: And closely feeles, and closely vndermines The faith of whom he had both hope and doubt; Meaning, in more apparant open course, To try his right, his fortune, and his force. 12 Loue, and alliance, had most firmly ioynd Vnto his part, that mighty Familie, The faire distended stock of Neuiles kind; Great by their many issued progenie: But greater by their worth (that clearely shin'd, And gaue faire light to their nobilitie) So that each corner of the Land became Enricht with some great Worthy, of that name. 13 But greatest in renowne doth Warwicke sit; That braue King-maker Warwicke; so farre growne, In grace with Fortune, that he gouerns it, And Monarchs makes; and, made, againe puts downe. What reuolutions, his first-mouing wit Heere brought about, are more then too well knowne; The fatall kindle-fire of those hot daies: Whose worth I may, whose worke I cannot praise. 14 With him, with Richard, Earle of Salisbury, Courtny and Brooke, and other his deare friends; He intimates his minde; and openly The present bad proceedings discommends; Laments the State, the peoples misery, And (that which such a pitier seldom mends) Oppression, that sharp two-edged sword, That others wounds, and wounds likewise his Lord. 15 “My Lords (saith he) how things are caried heere, “In this corrupted State, you plainely see; “What burthen our abused shoulders beare, “Charg'd with the waight of imbecillitie: “And in what base account all we appeare, “That stand without their grace that all must be; “And who they be, and how their course succeedes, “Our shame reports, and time bewraies their deedes. 16 “Aniou and Maine (the name that foule appeares; “Th'eternall scarre of our dismembred Land) “Guien, all lost; that did, three hundred yeares, “Remaine subiected vnder our Commaund. “From whence, mee thinks, there sounds vnto our eares “The voice of those deare ghosts, whose liuing hand “Got it with sweat, and kept it with their blood, “To doe vs (thankless vs) their of-spring good: 17 “And seeme to cry; What? can you thus behold “Their hatefull feete vpon our Graues should tread? “Your Fathers Graues; who gloriously did hold “That, which your shame hath left recouered? “Redeeme our Tumbs, O spirits too too cold: “Pull-backe these Towres, our Armes haue honored. “These Towres are yours: these Forts we built for you: “These walles doe beare our names; and are your due. 18 “Thus, well they may vpbraid our retchlesnes; “Whil'st wee, as if at league with infamie, “Ryot away, for nought, whole Prouinces; “Giue-vp, as nothing worth, all Normandie; “Traffique important Holdes, sell Fortresses “So long, that nought is left but misery; “Poore Calais, and these water-walles about, “That basely pownd vs in, from breaking out. 19 “And (which is worse) I feare, we shall in th'end “(Throwne from the glory of inuading Warre) “Be forc't our proper limits to defend: “Where euer men are not the same they are, “The hope of conquest, doth their spirits extend “Beyond the vsuall powres of valour, farre: “For, more is he that ventureth for more, “Then who fights, but for what hee had before. 20 “Put-to your hands, therefore, to reskew now “Th'indangered State (deare Lords) from this disgrace: “And let vs in our honour, labour how “To bring this scorned Land in better case. “No doubt, but God our action will allow, “That knowes my right, and how they rule the place, “Whose weakeness calls-vp our vnwillingnesse; “As opening euen the doore to our redresse. 21 “Though I protest, it is not for a Crowne “My soule is moov'd (yet, if it be my right, “I haue no reason to refuse mine owne) “But onely these indignities to right. “And what if God (whose iudgements are vnknowne) “Hath me ordain'd the man, that by my might “My Country shall be blest? If so it be; “By helping me, you raise your selues with me. 22 Those, in whom zeale and amity had bred A fore-impression of the right he had, These stirring words so much incouraged, That (with desire of innouation mad) They seem'd to runne-afore, not to be led; And to his fire doe quicker fuell adde: For, where such humors are prepar'd before; The opening them, makes them abound the more. 23 Then counsell take they, fitting their desire: (For, nought that fits not their desire is waigh'd) The Duke is straight aduised to retire Into the bounds of Wales, to leauie ayd: Which vnder smooth pretence he doth require; T'amoue such persons as the State betray'd, And to redresse th'oppression of the Land; The charme, which Weakenesse seldome doth withstand. 24 Ten thousand, straight caught with this bait of breath, Are towards greater lookt-for forces led: Whose power, the King, by all meanes, trauaileth In their arising to haue ruined: But, their preuenting Head so compasseth, That all ambushments warily are fled; Refusing ought to hazard by the way, Keeping his Greatnesse for a greater day. 25 And to the Cittie straight directs his course; The Cittie, seate of Kings, and Kings chiefe grace: Where, hauing found his entertainement worse By farre, then he expected in that place; Much disappointed, drawes from thence his force, And towards better trust, marcheth apace; And downe in Kent (fatall for discontents) Neere to thy bankes, faire Thames, doth pitch his tents. 26 And there, intrencht, plants his Artillerie; Artillerie, th'infernall instrument, New-brought from hell, to scourge mortalitie With hideous roaring, and astonishment: Engine of horrour, fram'd to terrifie And teare the Earth, and strongest Towres to rent: Torment of Thunder, made to mocke the skies; As more of power, in our calamities. 27 If that first fire (subtile Prometheus brought) Stolne out of heaven, did so afflict man-kinde, That euer since, plagu'd with a curious thought Of stirring search, could neuer quiet finde; What hath he done, who now by stealth hath got Lightning and thunder both, in wondrous kinde? What plague deserues so proud an enterprize? Tell Muse, and how it came, and in what wise. 28 It was the time, when faire Europa sate With many goodly Diadems addrest; And all her parts in florishing estate Lay beautiful, in order, at their rest: No swelling member, vnproportionate, Growne out of forme, sought to disturbe the rest: The lesse, subsisting by the greaters might; The greater, by the lesser kept vpright. 29 No noise of tumult euer wak't them all: Onely, perhaps, some priuate iarre within, For titles, or for confines, might befall; Which, ended soone, made better loue begin: But no eruption did, in generall, Breake down their rest, with vniuersall sin: No publique shock disioynted this faire frame, Till Nemesis from out the Orient came; 30 Fierce Nemesis, mother of fate and change, Sword-bearer of th'eternall Prouidence (That had so long, with such afflictions strange, Confounded Asias proud magnificence, And brought foule impious Barbarisme to range On all the glory of her excellence) Turnes her sterne looke at last vnto the West; As griev'd to see on earth such happy rest. 31 And for Pandora calleth presently (Pandora, Ioues faire gift, that first deceiv'd Poore Epimetheus imbecillitie, That thought he had a wondrous boone receiv'd; By means whereof, curious Mortalitie Was of all former quiet quite bereav'd): To whom, beeing come, deckt with all qualities, The wrathfull Goddesse breakes out in this wise: 32 Doost thou not see in what secure estate Those florishing faire Westerne parts remaine? As if they had made couenaunt with Fate, To be exempted free from others paine; At-one with their desires, friends with Debate, In peace with Pride, content with their owne gaine; Their bounds containe their minds, their minds appli'd To haue their bounds with plentie beautifi'd. 33 Deuotion (mother of Obedience) Beares such a hand on their credulitie, That it abates the spirit of eminence, And busies them with humble pietie. For, see what workes, what infinite expence, What monuments of zeale they edifie; As if they would, so that no stop were found, Fill all with Temples, make all holy ground. 34 But wee must coole this all-belieuing zeale, That hath enioy'd so faire a turne so long; And other reuolutions must reueale, Other desires, other designes among: Dislike of this, first by degrees shall steale Vpon the soules of men, perswaded wrong: And that abused Power, which thus hath wrought, Shall giue herselfe the sword to cut her throat. 35 Goe therefore thou, with all thy stirring traine Of swelling Sciences, the gifts of griefe: Go loose the links of that soule-binding chaine; Inlarge this vninquisitiue Beliefe: Call-vp mens spirits, that simplenes retaine: Enter their harts, &amp; Knowledge make the thiefe To open all the doores, to let in light; That all may all things see, but what is right. 36 Opinion Arme against Opinion growne: Make new-borne Contradiction still to rise; As if Thebes-founder, Cadmus, tongues had sowne, Instead of teeth, for greater mutinies. Bring new-defended Faith, against Faith knowne: Weary the Soule with contrarieties; Till all Religion become retrograde, And that faire tire, the maske of sinne be made. 37 And, better to effect a speedy end, Let there be found two fatall Instruments, The one to publish, th'other to defend, Impious Contention, and proud Discontents: Make, that instamped Characters may send Abroad, to thousands, thousand mens intent; And in a moment may dispatch much more, Then could a world of Pennes performe before. 38 Whereby, all quarrels, titles, secrecies, May vnto all be presently made knowne; Factions prepar'd, parties allur'd to rise, Sedition vnder faire pretentions sowne: Whereby, the vulgar may become so wise, That (with a self-presumption ouer-growne) They may of deepest mysteries debate, Controule their betters, censure actes of State. 39 And then, when this dispersed mischiefe shall Haue brought confusion in each mysterie, Call'd-vp contempt of states in generall, Ripened the humor of impiety; Then haue they th'other Engin, where-with-all They may torment their selfe-wrought miserie, And scourge each other, in so strange a wise, As time or Tyrants neuer could deuise. 40 For, by this stratagem, they shall confound All th'antient forme and discipline of Warre: Alter their Camps, alter their fights, their ground, Daunt mightie spirits, prowesse and manhood marre: For, basest cowardes from a far shall wound The most couragious, forc't to fight afarre; Valour, wrapt vp in smoake (as in the night) Shall perish without witnesse, without sight. 41 But first, before this generall disease Breake foorth into so great extreamitie, Prepare it by degrees; first kill this ease, Spoyle this proportion, marre this harmonie: Make greater States vpon the lesser seaze: Ioyne many kingdomes to one soueraigntie: Rayse a few Great, that may (with greater power) Slaughter each other, and mankinde deuour. 42 And first begin, with factions, to diuide The fairest Land; that from her thrusts the rest, As if she car'd not for the world beside; A world within her selfe, with wonders blest: Raise such a strife as time shall not decide, Till the deare blood of most of all her best Be poured foorth, and all her people tost With vnkinde tumults, and almost all lost. 43 Let her be made the sable Stage, whereon Shall first be acted bloodie Tragedies; That all the neighbour States, gazing thereon, May make their profite, by her miseries: And those, whom she before had marcht vpon, (Hauing, by this, both time and meane to rise) Made martiall by her Armes, shall growe so great, As (saue their owne) no force shall them defeat: 44 That when their power, vnable to sustaine And beare it selfe, vpon it selfe shall fall, She may (recouered of her wounds againe) Sit and behold their Parts as tragicall: For there must come a time, that shall obtaine Truce for distresse; when make-peace Hymen shall Bring the conioyned aduerse powers to bed, And set the Crowne (made one) vpon one head. 45 Out of which blessed vnion, shall arise A sacred branch (with grace and glory blest) Whose Virtue shall her Land so patronize, As all our power shall not her dayes molest: For, shee (faire shee) the Minion of the skies, Shall purchase (of the high'st) to hers such rest (Standing betweene the wrath of heauen and them) As no distresse shall touch her Diadem: 46 And, from the Rockes of Safetie, shall descrie The wondrous wracks, that Wrath layes ruined; All round about her, blood and miserie, Powres betray'd, Princes slaine, Kings massacred, States all-confus'd, brought to calamitie, And all the face of Kingdomes altered: Yet, she the same inuiolable stands, Deare to her owne, wonder to other Lands. 47 But, let not her defence discourage thee. For, neuer one, but shee, shall haue this grace, From all disturbs to be so long kept free, And with such glorie to discharge that place. And therefore, if by such a Power thou bee Stopt of thy course, reckon it no disgrace; Sith shee alone (being priuiledg'd from hie) Hath this large Patent of her dignitie. 48 This charge the Goddesse gaue: when, ready straight The subtill messenger, accompayned With all her crew of Artes that on her wait, Hastes to effect what she was counsailed: And out she pours, of her immense conceit, Vpon such searching spirits as trauayled In penetrating hidden secrecies; Who soone these meanes of miserie deuise. 49 And boldly breaking with rebellious minde Into their mothers close-lockt Treasurie, They Mineralls combustible do finde, Which in stopt concaues placed cunningly, They fire: and fire, imprisoned against kinde, Teares out a way, thrusts out his enemie; Barking with such a horror, as if wroth With man, that wrongs himselfe, and Nature both. 50 And this beginning had this cursed frame, Which Yorke now planted hath against his King; Presuming, by his powre, and by the same, His purpose vnto good effect to bring; When diuers of the grauest Councell came, Sent from the King, to vnderstand what thing Had thrust him into these proceedings bad, And what he sought, and what intent he had. 51 Who, with words mildly-sharpe, gently-seuere, Wrought on those wounds that must be toucht with heed; Applying rather salues of hope, then feare, Least corrasiues should desparat mischiefes breed. And, what my Lord (sayd they) should moue you here, In this vnseemely manner to proceed? Whose worth being such, as all the Land admires, Hath fairer wayes then these, to your desires. 52 Wil you, whose means, whose many friends, whose grace, Can worke the world in peace vnto your will, Take such a course, as shal your Blood deface, And make (by handling bad) a good Cause, ill? How many hearts hazard you in this case, That in all quiet plots would ayde you still? Hauing in Court a Partie farre more strong Then you conceiue, prest to redresse your wrong. 53 Phy, phy! forsake this hatefull course, my Lord: Downe with these Armes, that will but wound your Cause. What Peace may do, hazard not with the Sword: Lay downe the force that from your force with-drawes; And yeeld: and we will mediate such accord As shal dispense with rigor and the lawes; And interpose this solemne fayth of our Betwixt your fault, and the offended Power. 54 Which ingins of protests, and proffers kinde, Vrg'd out of seeming griefe and shewes of loue, So shooke the whole foundation of his Minde, As they did all his resolution moue, And present seem'd vnto their course inclin'd; So that the King would Sommerset remoue; The man, whose most intolerable pride Trode down his worth, and all good mens beside. 55 Which, they there vow'd, should presently be done: For, what will not peace-louers willing graunt, Where dangerous euents depend thereon, And men vnfurnisht, and the State in want? And if with words the conquest will be won, The cost is small: and who holds breath so scant As then to spare, though with indignitie? “Better descend, then end, in Maiestie. 56 And here-upon the Duke dissolues his force, Submits him to the King, on publique vow: The rather too, presuming on this course, For-that his sonne, the Earle of March, was now With mightier powers abroad: which would inforce His peace; which else the King would not allow. For, seeing not all of him, in him, he hath, His death would but giue life to greater wrath. 57 Yet, comming to the King, in former place (His foe) the Duke of Sommerset he findes: Whom openly, reproching to his face, Hee charg'd with treason in the highest kindes. The Duke returnes like speeches of disgrace; And fierie wordes bewray'd their flaming mindes: But yet the triall was for them deferd, Till fitter time allow'd it to be heard. 58 At Westminster, a Counsell, sommoned, Deliberates what course the Cause should end Of th'apprehended Duke of Yorke; whose head Doth now on others doubtfull breath depend. Law fiercely vrg'd his act, and found him dead: Friends fayl'd to speake, where they could not defend: Onely the King himselfe for mercy stood; As, prodigall of life, niggard of blood. 59 And, as if angrie with the Lawes of death, “Ah! why should you, sayd he, vrge things so far? “You, that inur'd with mercenarie breath, “And hyred tongue, so peremptorie are; “Brauing on him whom sorrow prostrateth: “As if you did with poore Affliction warre, “And prey on Frayltie, Folly hath betray'd; “Bringing the lawes to wound, neuer to ayd. 60 “Dispense sometime with sterne seueritie; “Make not the Lawes still traps to apprehend; “Win grace vpon the bad with clemencie; “Mercie may mend, whom malice made offend. “Death giues no thankes, but checkes Authoritie: “And life doth onely Maiestie commend. “Reuenge dies not, Rigor begets new wrath: “And blood hath neuer glorie; Mercy hath. 61 “And for my part (and my part should be chiefe) “I am most willing to restore his state: “And rather had I win him with reliefe, “Then lose him with despight, and get more hate. “Pittie drawes loue: blood-shed is natures griefe; “Compassion followes the vnfortunate: “And, losing him, in him I lose my power. “We rule who liue: the dead are none of our. 62 “And should our rigor lessen then the same, “Which we with greater glorie should retaine? “No; let him liue: his life must giue vs fame; “The childe of mercie newly borne againe. “As often burials are Physicians shame; “So, many deaths argue a Kings hard Raigne. “Why should we say, The Law must have her vigor? “The Law kills him; but quits not vs of rigor. 63 “You, to get more preferment by your wit, “Others to gaine the spoyles of miserie, “Labour with all your powre to follow it; “Shewing vs feares, to draw-on crueltie. “You vrge th'offence, not tell vs what is fit: “Abusing wrong-informed Maiestie: “As if our powre, were onely but to slay, “And that to saue, were a most dangerous way. 64 Thus, out of Pittie, spake that holy King: Whom milde affections led to hope the best; When Sommerset began to vrge the thing With words of hotter temper, thus exprest; “Deare soueraigne Lord, the Cause in managing “Is more then yours; t'imports the publique rest: “We all haue part, it toucheth all our good: “And life's ill spar'd, that's spar'd to cost more blood. 65 “Compassion, here, is crueltie my Lord; “Pittie will cut our throates, for sauing so. “What benefite enioy we by the sword, “If mischiefe shall escape to draw-on mo? “Why should we giue, what Law cannot afford, “To be'accessaries to our proper wo? “Wisedome must iudge, 'twixt men apt to amend, “And mindes incurable, borne to offend. 66 “It is no priuat Cause (I do protest) “That moues me thus to prosecute his deede. “Would God his blood, and mine, had well releast “The dangers, that his pride is like to breed. “Although, at me, hee seemes to haue addrest “His spight; 'tis not the end hee hath decreed, “I am not he alone, hee doth pursue: “But thorow me, he meanes to shoot at you. 67 “For, thus, these great Reformers of a State “(Aspiring to attaine the Gouernment) “Still take aduantage of the peoples hate, “Who euer hate such as are eminent. “(For, who can great affaires negotiat, “And all a wayward multitude content?) “And then these people-minions, they must fall “To worke-out vs, to work themselues int'all. 68 “But note, my Lord, first, who is in your hand; “Then, how he hath offended, what's his end: “It is the man, whose Race would seeme to stand “Before your Right, and doth a Right pretend: “Who (Traitor-like) hath rais'd a mightie Band, “With colour, your proceedings to amend. “Which if it should haue hapned to succeed, “You had not now sate to adiudge his deed. 69 “If oftentimes the person, not th'offence, “Haue beene sufficient cause of death to some, “Where publique safety puts in euidence “Of mischiefe, likely by their life to come; “Shall hee, whose fortune, and his insolence, “Haue both deserv'd to die, escape that doome; “When you shall saue your Land, your Crowne thereby; “And since You cannot liue, vnlesse He die? 70 Thus spake th'aggrieued Duke, that grauely saw Th'incompatible powers of Princes mindes; And what affliction his escape might draw Vnto the State, and people of all kindes: And yet the humble yeelding, and the aw, Which Yorke there shew'd, so good opinion findes, That (with the rumor of his Sonnes great strength, And French affaires) he there came quit at length. 71 For, euen the feare t'exasperat the heat Of th'Earle of March, whose forward youth and might Well follow'd, seem'd a proud reuenge to threat, If any shame should on his Father light: And then desire in Gascoyne to reget The glorie lost, which home-broyles hinder might, Aduantaged the Duke, and sav'd his head; Which, questionlesse, had else beene hazarded. 72 For, now had Burdeux offered (vpon ayd) Present reuolt, if we would send with speed. Which faire aduantage to haue then delay'd, Vpon such hopes, had beene a shamefull deed. And therefore this, all other courses stayd, And outwardly these inward hates agreed; Giuing an interpause to pride and spight: Which breath'd, but to breake-out with greater might. 73 Whil'st dreadfull Talbot, terror late of Fraunce, (Against the Genius of our Fortune) stroue, The downe-throwne glorie of our State t'aduance; Where Fraunce far more then Fraunce he now doth proue: For, friends, opinion, and succeeding chaunce (Which wrought the weake to yeeld, the strong to loue) Were not the same, that he had found before In happier times; when lesse would haue done more. 74 For, both the Britaine, and Burgonian now, Came altred with our lucke, and won with theirs (Those bridges, and the gates, that did allow So easie passage vnto our affaires) Iudging it safer to endeuour how To link with strength, then leane vnto despaires. “And, who wants friends, to backe what he begins, “In Lands far off, gets not, although he wins. 75 Which too well prov'd this fatall enterprize, The last, that lost vs all wee had to lose. Where, though aduantag'd by some mutinies, And pettie Lords, that in our Cause arose: Yet those great fayl'd; whose ready quick supplies, Euer at hand, cheer'd vs, and quail'd our foes. Succours from far, come seldome to our minde. “For, who holds league with Neptune, and the winde? 76 Yet, worthy Talbot, thou didst so imploy The broken remnants of discattered power, That they might see it was our destiny, Not want of spirit, that lost vs what was our: Thy dying hand sold them the victorie With so deare wounds, as made the conquest sowre: So much it cost to spoyle who were vndon; And such adoe to win, when they had won. 77 For, as a fierce courageous Mastiue fares; That, hauing once sure fast'ned on his foe, Lyes tugging on that hold, neuer forbeares, What force soeuer force him to forgo: The more he feeles his woundes, the more he dares; As if his death were sweet, in dying so: So held his hold this Lord, whil'st he held breath; And scarce, but with much blood, lets goe in death. 78 For, though he saw prepar'd, against his side, Both vnlike fortune, and vnequall force, Borne with the swelling current of their pride Downe the maine streame of a most happy course: Yet standes he stiffe, vndasht, vnterrifi'd; His minde the same, although his fortune worse: Virtue in greatest dangers being best showne; And though opprest, yet neuer ouer-throwne. 79 For, rescuing of besieg'd Chatillion (Where hauing first constraind the French to fly, And following hard on their confusion) Comes (lo) incountred with a strong supply Of fresh-arriuing powers, that backe thrust-on Those flying troupes, another chaunce to trie: Who, double arm'd, with shame, and fury, straine To wreake their foyle, and win their fame againe. 80 Which seeing, th'vndaunted Talbot (with more might Of spirit to will, then hands of power to do) Preparing t'entertaine a glorious fight, Cheeres-vp his wearied Souldiers thereunto. “Courage, sayth hee: those brauing troupes, in sight, “Are but the same, that now you did vndo. “And what if there be come some more then they? “They come to bring more glory to the day. 81 “Which day must either thrust vs out of all; “Or all, with greater glorie, backe restore. “This day, your valiant worth aduenture shall, “For what our Land shall neuer fight for, more. “If now we faile, with vs is like to fall “All that renowne which we haue got before. “This is the last: if we discharge the same, “The same shall last to our eternall fame. 82 “Neuer had worthy men, for any fact, “A more faire glorious Theater, then we; “Whereon true Magnanimitie might act “Braue deedes, which better witnessèd could be. “For, lo, from yonder Turrets, yet vnsackt, “Your valliant fellowes stand, your worth to see, “T'auouch your valour, if you liue to gaine; “And if we die, that we di'd not in vaine. 83 “And euen our foes (whose proud and powreful might “Would seeme to swallow vp our dignitie) “Shall not keep-backe the glory of our right; “Which their confounded blood shall testifie: “For, in their wounds, our goarie swords shall write “The monumentes of our eternitie: “For, vile is honor, and a title vaine, “The which, true worth and danger do not gaine. 84 “For, they shall see, when we (in carelesse sort) “Shall throwe our selues on their despised speares, “Tis not despaire, that doth vs so transport: “But euen true Fortitude, that nothing feares; “Sith we may well retire vs, in some sort: “But, shame on him that such a foul thought beares. “For, be they more, let Fortune take their part, “Wee'll tugge her too, and scratch her, ere we part. 85 This sayd; a fresh infus'd desire of fame Enters their warmed blood, with such a will, That they deem'd long, they were not at the game; And, though they marcht apace, thought they stood still, And that their lingring foes too slowely came To ioyne with them, spending much time but ill: Such force had wordes, fierce humors vp to call, Sent from the mouth of such a Generall. 86 Who yet, his forces weighing (with their fire) Turnes him about, in priuate, to his Sonne (A worthy Sonne, and worthy such a Sire) And telleth him, what ground hee stood vpon, Aduising him in secret to retire; Considering how his youth, but now begun, Would make it vnto him, at all, no staine: His death small fame, his flight no shame could gaine. 87 To whom, th'aggrieued Sonne (as if disgrac't) “Ah Father, haue you then selected me “To be the man, whom you would haue displac't “Out of the roule of Immortalitie? “What haue I done this day, that hath defac't “My worth, that my hands worke despis'd should be? “God shield, I should beare home a Cowards name, “He long enough hath liv'd, who dyes with fame. 88 At which, the Father, toucht with sorrowing-ioy, Turnd him about (shaking his head) and sayes; “O my deare Sonne, worthy a better day, “To enter thy first youth, in hard assayes. And now had Wrath, impatient of delay, Begun the fight, and farther speeches stayes: Furie thrustes on; striuing, whose sword should be First warmed, in the wounds of th'enemie. 89 Hotly, these small but mightie-minded, Bands (As if ambitious now of death) doe straine Against innumerable armed hands, And gloriously a wondrous fight maintaine; Rushing on all what-euer strength withstands, Whetting their wrath on blood, and on disdaine: And so far thrust, that hard 'twere to descry Whether they more desire to kill, or dye. 90 Frank of their owne, greedy of others blood, No stroke they giue, but wounds, no wound, but kills: Neere to their hate, close to their work they stood, Hit where they would, their hand obeyes their wills; Scorning the blowe from far, that doth no good, Loathing the cracke, vnlesse some blood it spils: No wounds could let-out life that wrath held in, Till others wounds, reueng'd, did first begin. 91 So much, true resolution wrought in those Who had made couenant with death before, That their smal number (scorning so great foes) Made Fraunce most happie, that there were no more; And Fortune doubt to whom she might dispose That weary day; or vnto whom restore The glory of a Conquest dearely bought; Which scarce the Conqueror could thinke well got. 92 For, as with equall rage, and equall might, Two aduerse windes combat, with billowes proud, And neither yeeld; Seas, skies maintaine like fight, Waue against waue oppos'd, and clowd to clowd: So warre both sides, with obstinate despight, With like reuenge, and neither partie bow'd; Fronting each other with confounding blowes, No wound, one sword, vnto the other owes: 93 Whil'st Talbot (whose fresh ardor hauing got A meruailous aduantage of his yeares) Carries his vnfelt age, as if forgot, Whirling about, where any need appeares: His hand, his eye, his wits all present, wrought The function of the glorious Part he beares: Now vrging here, now cheering there, he flyes, Vnlockes the thickest troups, where most force lyes. 94 In midst of wrath, of wounds, of blood, and death, There is he most, where as he may do best: And there the closest ranks hee seuereth, Driues-back the stoutest powres, that forward prest: There makes his sword his way: there laboreth Th'infatigable hand that neuer ceast; Scorning, vnto his mortall wounds to yeeld; Till Death became best maister of the Field. 95 Then like a sturdy Oke, that hauing long, Against the warres of fiercest windes, made head When (with some forc't tempestuous rage, more strong) His down-borne top comes ouer-maistered, All the neere bordering Trees (hee stood among) Crusht with his waightie fall, lie ruined: So lay his spoyles, all round about him slaine, T'adorne his death, that could not die in vaine. 96 On th'other part, his most all-daring sonne (Although the inexperience of his yeares Made him lesse skil'd in what was to be done; And yet did carrie him beyond all feares) Into the maine Battalion, thrusting on Neere to the King, amidst the chiefest Peeres, With thousand wounds, became at length opprest; As if he scorn'd to die, but with the best. 97 Who thus both, hauing gaind a glorious end, Soone ended that great day; that set so red, As all the purple Plaines, that wide extend, A sad tempestuous season witnessed. So much adoe had toyling Fraunce to rend, From vs, the right so long inherited: And so hard went we from what we possest; As with it went the blood wee loued best. 98 Which blood, not lost, but fast lay'd vp with heed In euerlasting fame, is there held deere, To seale the memorie of this dayes deed; Th'eternall euidence of what we were: To which, our Fathers, wee, and who succeed, Doe owe a sigh, for that it toucht vs neere: Nor must we sinne so much, as to neglect The holy thought of such a deare respect. 99 Yet happy-hapless day, blest ill-lost breath, Both for our better fortune, and your owne! For, what foul wounds, what spoyl, what shamefull death, Had by this forward resolution growne, If at S. Albons, Wakefield, Barnet-heath, It should vnto your infamie beene showne? Blest you, that did not teach how great a fault Euen Virtue is, in actions that are naught. 100 Yet, would this sad dayes losse had now beene all, That this day lost: then should we not much plaine, If hereby we had com'n but there to fall; And that day, ended, ended had our paine: Then small the losse of Fraunce, of Guien small; Nothing the shame to be turn'd home againe Compar'd with other shames. But now, Fraunce, lost, Sheds vs more blood, then all her winning cost. 101 For losing warre abroad, at home lost peace; Be'ing with our vnsupporting selues close pent; And no dessignes for pride (that did increase) But our owne throats, and our owne punishment; The working spirit ceast not, though work did cease, Hauing fit time to practise discontent, And stirre vp such as could not long lie still: “Who, not imploy'd to good, must needes do ill. 102 And now this griefe of our receiued shame, Gaue fit occasion, for ambitious care, To draw the chiefe reproche of all the same On such as obuious vnto hatred are, Th'especiall men of State: who, all the blame Of whatsoeuer Fortune doth, must beare. For, still, in vulgar eares delight it breeds, To haue the hated, authors of misdeeds. 103 And therefore, easily, great Sommerset (Whom Enuie long had singled out before) With all the vollie of disgraces met, As th'onely marke that Fortune plac't therfore: On whose ill-wrought opinion, Spight did whet The edge of Wrath, to make it pearce the more: And Grief was glad t'haue gotten now on whom To lay the fault of what must light on some. 104 Whereon, th'againe out-breaking Yorke beginnes To build new modules of his old desire. And se'ing the booty Fortune for him winnes, Vpon the ground of this inkindled ire, He takes th'aduantages of others sinnes To ayde his owne, and help him to aspire: For, doubting, peace should better scanne deeds past, He thinkes not safe, to haue his sword out, last: 105 Especially, since euery man (now prest To innouation) doe with rancor swell: A stirring humor gen'rally possest Those peace-spilt times, weary of beeing well: The weake with wrongs, the happy tyr'd with rest, And many mad, for what, they could not tell: The World, euen great with Change, thought it vvent wrong To stay beyond the bearing-time, so long. 106 And therefore now these Lords confedered (Beeing much increast in number and in spight) So shap't their course, that gathering to a head, They grew to be of formidable might: The'abused world, so hastily is led (Some for reuenge, some for wealth, some for delight) That Yorke, from small beginning troups, soone drawes A world of men, to venture in his Cause. 107 Like as proud Seuerne, from a priuat head, With humble streames at first, doth gently glide, Till other Riuers haue contributed The springing riches of their store beside; Where-with at length high-swelling, she doth spread, Her broad-distended waters, lay'd so wide, That comming to the Sea, shee seemes, from farre, Not to haue tribute brought, but rather warre: 108 Euen so is Yorke now growne, and now is bent T'incounter with the best, and for the best. Whose neere approach the King hastes to preuent, With hope, farre off to haue his power supprest; Fearing the Cittie, least some insolent, And mutinous, should harten on the rest To take his part. But hee so forward set That at S. Albones both the Armies met. 109 Where-to, their haste farre fewer hands did bring, Then else their better leysure would haue done: And yet too many for so foul a thing; Sith who did best, hath but dishonour won: For, whil'st some offer peace, sent from the King, Warwicks too forward hand hath Warre begon; A warre, that doth the face of Warre deforme: Which still is foul; but foulest, wanting forme. 110 And, neuer valiant Leaders (so well knowne For braue performed actions done before) Did blemish their discretion and renowne In any weake effected seruice more; Bringing such powres into so straight a Towne, As to some Citty-tumult or vp-rore: Which, slaughter, and no battaile, might be thought; Sith that side vs'd their swords, and this their throat. 111 But this, on th'error of the King, is lai'd, And vpon Sommersets desire t'obtaine The day with peace: for which they longer staid Then wisedome would, aduent'ring for the Maine: Whose force, in narrow streets once ouer-laid, Neuer recouerd head: but euen there slaine The Duke and all the greatest Leaders are; The King himselfe beeing taken prisoner. 112 Yet not a prisoner to the outward eye, For-that he must seeme grac't with his lost day; All things beeing done for his commoditie, Against such men as did the State betray: For, with such apt deceiuing clemencie And seeming-order, Yorke did so allay That touch of wrong, as made him make great stealth In weaker minds, with shew of Common-wealth. 113 Long-lookt-for powre thus got into his hand, The former face of Court doth new appeare: And all th'especiall Charges of Commaund, To his partakers distributed were: Himselfe is made Protector of the Land. A title found, which couertly did beare All-working powre vnder another stile; And yet the soueraigne Part doth act the while. 114 The King held onely but an emptie name, Left, with his life: whereof the proofe was such, As sharpest pride could not transpearce the same, Nor all-desiring greedinesse durst touch: Impietie had not inlarg'd their shame As yet so wide, as to attempt so much: Mischiefe was not full ripe, for such foul deedes; Left, for th'vnbounded malice that succeedes. The end of the Sixt Booke. THE SEVENTH BOOKE. THE ARGVMENT. The King's repriz'd: Yorke, and his side retires; And making head againe, is put to flight: Returnes into the Land, his right requires: Hauing regain'd the King, confirmes his right: And, whil'st his rash improuidence aspires, Is slaine at Wakefield, by Q. Mar'grets might: Who, at S. Albones, backe her Lord regaines; Is forc't fr? thence: &amp; March the Crowne attaines. 1 Disordinate Authoritie, thus gaind, Knew not at first, or durst not to proceed With an out-breaking course; but stood restraind Within the compasse of respectiue heed: Distrust of friends, and powre of foes, detaind That mounting will, from making too much speed: For, though he held the powre he longd to win, Yet had not all the keyes to let him in. 2 The Queene abroad, with a reuenging hand (Arm'd with her owne disgrace, and others spight, Gath'ring th'oppressed partie of the Land) Held ouer him the threatning sword of might; That forc't him, in the tearmes of awe, to stand (Who else had burst-vp Right, to come t'his right) And kept him so confus'd, that he knew not To make vse of the meanes, which he had got. 3 For, either by his fearing to restraine The person of the King; or by neglect Of guarding him with a sufficient traine, The watchfull Queene, with cunning, doth effect A practice that recouers him againe (As one that with best care could him protect:) And h'is conuaid to Couentry, to those Who well knew how of Maiestie dispose. 4 Though this weake King had blunted thus before The edge of powre, with so dull clemencie, And left him nothing else was gracious, more Then euen the title of his Sov'raigntie; Yet is that title of so precious store, As it makes, golden, leaden Maiestie: And where, or how-soeuer it doth sit, Is sure t'haue the world attend on it. 5 Whether it be, that Forme, and Eminence, Adorn'd with Pomp and State, begets this awe: Or, whether an in-bred obedience To Right and Powre, doth our affections drawe: Or, whether sacred Kings worke reuerence, And make that Nature now, which was first Law, We know not: but, the Head will draw the Parts; And good Kings, with our bodies, haue our harts. 6 For, lo, no sooner was his person ioyn'd With this distracted body of his friends; But, straight the Duke, and all that faction find, They lost the onely Engin for their ends: Authoritie, with Maiestie combin'd, Stands bent vpon them now, and powrefull sends Them summons to appeare, who lately held That powre themselues, and could not be compeld. 7 Where-with confus'd, as either not prepar'd For all euents; or se'ing the times not fit; Or mens affections, failing in regard; Or their owne forces, not of powre as yet: They all retire them home; and neither dar'd T'appeare, or to stand-out to answere it: This vnfore-thought-on accident, confounds All their dessignes, and frustrates all their grounds: 8 As vsually it fares, with those that plot These machines of Ambition, and high pride; Who (in their chiefest counsels ouer-shot) For all things saue what serue the turne, prouide; Whil'st that, which most imports, rests most forgot, Or waigh'd not, or contemn'd, or vndescri'd; That some-thing may be euer ouer-gone, Where courses shall be crost, and men vndone. 9 Yorke into Wales, Warwicke to Calais hies, Some to the North, others to other parts; As if they ran both from their dignities, And also from themselues, and their owne harts: “(The mind decay'd, in publique ieopardies, “To th'ill at hand, onely it selfe conuerts) That none would thinke, Yorkes hopes, being so neere dry, Could euer flowe againe, and swell so hie. 10 And yet, for all this ebbing, Chance remaines, The spring that feedes that hope (which leaues men last): Whom no'affliction so entire restraines, But that it may remount, as in times past: Though he had lost his place, his powre, his paines; Yet held his loue, his friends, his title fast: The whole frame of that fortune could not faile; As that, which hung by more then by one naile. 11 Else might we thinke, what errour had it bin, These parts thus sev'red, not t'haue quite destroy'd; But that they saw it not the way to win. Some more dependances there were beside: Which Age, and Fate, keeps vs from looking in, That their true Counsells come not right descri'd; Which, our presumptuous wits must not condem: They be'ing not ignorant; but we, of them. 12 For, heere, we looke vpon another Crown, An other image of Nobilitie, (Which ciuile Discord had not yet brought down Vnto a lower range of dignity); Vpon a Powre as yet not ouer-flowne With th'Ocean of all-drowning Sov'raintie. These Lords, who thus against their Kings draw swords, Taught Kings to come, how to be more then Lords. 13 Which well this Queene observ'd; and therefore sought To draw them in, and ruine them with Peace; Whom Force (she saw) more dangerous had wrought, And did their powre and malice but increase: And therefore, to the Citty hauing got, A Counsell was convok't, all iarres to cease: Where come these Lords at length; but yet so strong, As if to doe, rather then suffer wrong. 14 Here Scottish border broyles, and feares of Fraunce, Vrg'd with the present times necessity, Brought forth a suttle-shadowed countenance Of quiet peace, resembling Amitie; Wrapt in a strong and curious ordinaunce, Of many Articles, bound solemnly: As if those Gordian knots could be so ti'd, As no impatient sword could them diuide: 15 Especially, whereas the selfe same ends Concur not in a point of like respect; But that each party couertly intends Thereby their owne designments to effect: Which Peace, with more indangering wounds, offends, Then Warre can doe; that stands vpon suspect, And neuer can be ty'd with other chaine, Then intermutuall benefite and gaine. 16 As well by this concluded Act is seene: Which had no power to holde-in minds, out-bent; But quickly was dissolv'd and canceld cleene, Either by Warwicks fortune or intent. How euer vrg'd, the Seruants of the Queene Assaulted his, as he from Counsell went: Where, his owne person, egerly pursu'd, Hardly (by Boate) escap't the multitude. 17 Which deed, most heynous made, and vrg'd as his, The Queene (who soone th'aduantage apprehends) Thought forthwith t'haue committed him on this: But, he preuents, flyes North-ward to his friends, Shewes them his danger, and what hope there is In her, that all their ouerthrowes intends; “And that these drifts, th'effects of this Peace are: “Which giues more deadly wounding blowes, then war. 18 Strooke with his heate, began the others fire (Kindled with danger, and disdaine) t'inflame: Which hauing well prepar'd, to his desire, He leaues the farther growing of the same, And vnto Calais (to his strong retire) With speed betakes him, to preuent the fame Of his impos'd offence; least, in disgrace, He might be dispossessed of that place. 19 Yorke straight aduis'd the Earle of Salsbury, T'addresse him to the King: and therevpon, With other grieuances, to signifie Th'iniurious act committed on his Sonne; And there, to vrge the breach of th'Amitie, By these sinister plots to be begun: But, he so strongly goes, as men might ghesse, He purpos'd not to craue, but make redresse. 20 Whom, the Lord Audly, hasting to restraine, (Sent, with ten thousand men, well furnished) Encountred on Blore-heath; where he is slaine, And all his powre and force discomfited: Which chaunce, so opened and let-out againe The hopes of Yorke (whom Peace had fettered) That he resolues, what-euer should befall, To set vp's Rest, to venture now for all. 21 Fury, vnti'd, and broken out of bands, Runnes desp'rate presently to either head: Faction and Warre (that neuer wanted hands For Bloud and Mischiefe) soone were furnished: Affection findes a side: and out it stands; Not by the Cause, but by her int'rest led: And many, vrging Warre, most forward are; “Not that 't is iust, but only that 'tis Warre. 22 Whereby, the Duke is growne t'a mighty head In Shropshire, with his Welsh and Northren ayde: To whom came Warwicke, hauing ordered His charge at Calais; and with him conuay'd Many braue Leaders, that aduentured Their fortunes on the side that he had lay'd: Whereof as chiefe, Trollop and Blunt excell'd: But, Trollop fayld his friends; Blunt faithfull held. 23 The King (prouok't these mischiefes to preuent, Follow'd with Sommerset and Excester) Strongly appointed, all his forces bent, Their malice to correct or to deterre: And, drawing neere, a reuerent Prelate sent To proffer pardon, if they would referre Their Cause to Peace; as being a cleaner course Vnto their ends, then this foule barb'rous force. 24 “For, what a warre, sayd he, is here begun, “Where euen the victory is held accurst? “And who-so winnes, it will be so ill won, “That though he haue the best, he speeds the worst. “For, here your making, is, to be vndon; “Seeking t'obtaine the State, you lose it first: “Both sides being one, the bloud consum'd all one; “To make it yours, you worke to haue it none. 25 “Leaue then with this, though this be yet a staine “T'attempt this sinne, to be so neere a fall. “The doubtfull Dye of warre, cast at the Maine, “Is such, as one bad chaunce may lose you all. “A certaine sinne, seekes an vncertaine gaine: “Which, got, your selues euen wayle and pitty shall. “No way, but Peace, leades out from blood and feares; “To free your selues, the Land, and vs, from teares. 26 Whereto the discontented part replyes; “That they, hereto by others wrongs inforc't, “Had no way else but these extremities, “And worst meanes of redresse, t'auoide the worst. “For, since that peace did but their spoyles deuise, “And held them out from grace (as men diuorc't “From th'honors, that their fortunes did afford) “Better die with the sword, then by the sword. 27 “For, if pacts, vowes, or oaths, could haue done ought, “There had enough been done: but, to no end “Saue to their ruine, who had ever sought “To auoide these broyls, as grieuing to contend; “Smothring disgraces, drawing to parts remote, “As exil'd men: where now they were, to attend “His Grace with all respect, and reuerence; “Not with the sword of malice, but defence. 28 Whereby, they shewed, that words were not to win: But yet the Pardon works so feelingly, That to the King, that very night, came-in Sir Andrew Trollop, with some company, Contented to redeeme his sinne with sinne; Disloyalty, with infidelitie: And, by this meanes, became discouered quite All th'orders of th'intended next dayes fight. 29 Which so much wrought vpon their weakened feares, That presently their Campe brake vp, ere day; And euery man with all his speed prepares, According to their course, to shift their way. Yorke, with his youngest Sonne, tow'ards Ireland beares; Warwicke to Calais, where his safety lay; To that sure harbor of conspiracie, Enuies Retreit, Rebellions nursery. 30 Which fatall place, seemes that with either hand Is made t'offend. For, Fraunce sh'afflicts with th'one: And with the other, did infest this Land; As if ordained to doe good to none: But, as a Gate to both our ills did stand, To let-out plagues on vs, and int'her owne: A part without vs, that small good hath bin But to keepe, lesse intire, the whole within. 31 And there, as in their all and best support, Is Warwicke got, with March and Salsbury; When all the Gates of England, euery Port And Shore close-shut, debarres their reentry; Lockt out from all; and all left in that sort, As no meanes seemes can ayde their misery. This wound, giuen without blowe, weakens them more, Then all their losse of blood had done before. 32 For, now againe vpon them frowningly Stands Powre with Fortune, trampling on their States; And brands them with the markes of Infamy; Rebellions, Treasons, and Assassinats; Attaints their Bloud, in all Posteritie; Ransacks their Lands, spoiles their Confederats; And layes so hideous colours on their crimes, As would haue terrified more timorous times. 33 But, heere could doe no good: for why? this Age, Being in a course of motion, could not rest, Vntill the reuolution of their rage Came to that poynt, whereto it was addrest. Misfortune, crosses, ruine, could not swage That heate of hope, or of reuenge, at least. “The World, once set a-worke, cannot soone cease: “Nor euer is the same, it is in peace. 34 For, other motions, other int'rests heere, The acting spirits vp and awake doe keepe: “Faith, friendship, honour is more sure, more deere, “And more it selfe, then when it is asleepe: Worth will stand-out, and doth no shadowes feare: Disgraces make impressions far more deepe; When Ease, ere it will stirre, or breake her rest, Lyes still, beares all, content to be opprest. 35 Yorke, and his side, could not, while life remain'd, Though thus disperst, but worke and interdeale: Nor any sword, at home, could keepe restrain'd Th'out-breaking powres of this innated zeale. This humor had so large a passage gain'd, On th'inward body of the Common-weale; That 'twas impossible to stop, by force, This current of affection's violent course. 36 Yet they at home (disorder to keepe forth) Did all what powre could doe, or wit inuent; Plac't, in th'auoided roomes, men of great worth; Young Sommerset, with strength to Calais sent; Northumberland and Clifford to the North; (Whereof They onely had the gouernment) Defend all landings, barre all passages, Striue to redresse the publique grieuances: 37 And, to this end, summon a Parlement: Wherein, when-as the godly King would not, Vnto th'attainder of the Lords, consent; The Queene in griefe (and in her passions hot) Breakes out in speech, louingly violent: “And what (saith shee) my Lord, haue you forgot “To rule and be a King? Why will you thus “Be milde to them, and cruell vnto vs? 38 “What good haue you procur'd by clemencie, “But giuen to wilde presumption much more head? “And now what cure, what other remedie “Can to our desp'rat wounds be ministred? “Men are not good, but for necessitie; “Nor orderly are euer borne, but bred. “Sad want, and pouertie, makes men industrious: “But, Law must make them good, and feare obsequious. 39 “My Lord; Hee gouerns well, that's well obayd: “And temp'rat Rigour euer safely sits. “For, as to him, who Cotis did vpbraid, “And call'd his rigor, madnesse, raging fits; “Content thee, thou vnskilfull man, he said, “My madnesse keepes my Subiects in their wits: “So, to like course my Lord, y'are forc't to fall; “Or else you must, in th'end, vndoe vs all. 40 “Looke but, I pray, on this deare part of you; “This branch (sprung fr? your blood) your owne aspect: “Looke on this Childe, and think what shal ensue “To this faire hope of ours, by your neglect. “Though you respect not vs, wrong not his due, “That must his right, left you, from you expect; “The right of the renowned Lancasters, “His fathers fathers, and great grand-fathers. 41 “Then turnes t'her sonne: O sonne! dost thou not see? “He is not mov'd, nor toucht, nor weighes our teares. “What shall I doe? What hope is left for me, “When he wants will to help, &amp; thou wantst yeares? “Could yet these hands of thine but partners bee “In these my labours, to keep-out our feares, “How well were I? that now alone must toile, “And turne, and tosse; and yet vndone the while. 42 “I knowe, if thou could'st helpe, thy mother thus “Should not beyond her strength endure so much; “Nor these proud Rebels, that would ruine vs, “Scape with their hainous treasons, without touch: “I knowe, thou would'st conceiue how dangerous “Mercy were vnto those, whose hopes are such; “And not preserue, whom Law hath ouer-throwne, “Sauing their liuely-hood, to lose our owne. 43 “But, sith thou canst not, nor I able am, “Thou must no more expect of me, deare Son; “Nor yet, in time to come, thy Mother blame, “If thou, by others weakenesse be vndon. “The world, with me, must testifie the same, “That I haue done my best, what could be done; “And haue not fail'd, with hazard of my life, “The duetie of a mother and a wife. 44 “But well; I see which way the world will goe: “And let it goe: and so turnes her about, Full, with stout griefe, and with disdainefull woe; Which, now, her words shut-vp, her lookes let-out. The cast of her side-bended eye, did showe Both sorrow and reproofe; se'ing so great doubt, And no powre to redresse, but stand and vex, Imprisoned in the fetters of her sex. 45 Yet, so much wrought these mouing arguments (Drawne from that blood, where Nature vrg'd her Right) As his all-vpward tending zeale relents; And, downeward to his State, declines his sight: And so, to their Attainders he consents; Prouided, He, on their submission, might Out of his Princely powre, in his owne name, Without a Parlement, reuoke the same. 46 Whil'st Sommerset with maine endeuour lay To get his giuen (but vngot) gouernment, The stout Calisians (bent another way) Fiercely repell him, frustrate his intent: Yet takes he Guines, landing at VVhitsandbay: Where-as the swordes, hee brought, would not consent To wound his foes: the fight no rancor hath: Malice was friends: and Warre was without wrath. 47 Though hee their hands, yet VVarwicke had their hearts: To whom, both men and shipping they betray'd; Whilst Englands (though debarred) shore imparts, To him, her other-where intended ayde: For, the Lord Riuers, passing to those parts, T'haue fresh supplies vnto the Duke conuay'd; At Sandwich, with his Sonne accompayned, Staying for winde, was taken in his bed. 48 Whose shipping, and prouisions, VVarwicke takes For Ireland, with his Chieftaine to conferre: And within thirtie dayes this voyage makes, And backe-returnes, ere knowne to haue beene there: So that the heauens, the sea, the winde partakes With him; as if they of his faction were; Or that his spirit and valour were combin'd, With destinie, t'effect what he design'd. 49 Which working, though without, and on the shore, Reacht yet vnto the centre of the Land; Searcht all those humors that were bred before; Shakes the whole frame, whereon the State did stand; “Affection, pittie, fortune, feare being more “Farre off and absent, then they are at hand. “Pittie becomes a traytor with th'opprest: “And many haue beene rays'd, by being supprest. 50 For, they had left, although themselues were gone, Opinion and their memorie behinde. Which so preuayles, that nought could here be done, But straight was knowne as soone as once design'd: Court, Councell-chamber, Closet, all were won, To be reuealers of the Princes minde: So false is Faction, and so smooth a lyer, As that it neuer had a side entire. 51 Whereby, th'exil'd had leasure to preuent, And circumuent, what-euer was deuiz'd: Which made, that Faulconbridge, to Sandwich bent, That Fortresse and the Gouernour surpriz'd: Who, presently from thence to Calais sent, Had his vnguiltie blood there sacrifiz'd: And Faulconbridge, returning backe, relates Th'affection here, and zeale of all estates. 52 Drawne with which newes, and with a spirit that dar'd T'attempt on any likelihood of support; They take th'aduantage of so great regard; Their landing here secur'd them in such sort, By Faulconbridge; the fatall bridge prepar'd To be the way of blood, and to transport Returning furie to make greater wounds Then euer England saw within her bounds. 53 And but with fifteene hundred men do land, Vpon a Land, with many millions stor'd: So much, did high-presuming Courage stand On th'ayde, home-disobedience would afford. Nor were their hopes deceiv'd: for, such a hand Had Innouation ready for the sword, As ere they neere vnto the Cittie drew, Their powre beyond all former greatnesse grew. 54 Muse, what may we imagine was the Cause That Furie workes thus vniuersally? What humor, what affection, is it, drawes Sides, of such powre, to this Nobilitie? Was it their Conscience, to redresse the Lawes; Or malice, to a wrong-plac't Sov'raintie, That caus'd them (more then wealth, or life) desire Destruction, ruine, bloud-shed, sword and fire? 55 Or was the Powre of Lords (thus inter-plac't Betwixt the height of Princes, and the State) Th'occasion that the people so imbrac't Their actions, and attend on this Debate? Or had their Greatnesse, with their Worth, imbas't The Touch of Royaltie to so lowe rate, As their opinion could such tumults moue? Then Powre, and Virtue, you contagious proue. 56 And Perianders leuell'd Eares of Corne Shew what is fittest for the publique Rest; And that the hyest Minions which adorne A Common-weale (and doo become it best) Are Zeale and Iustice, Law, and Customes, borne Of hye descent; that neuer do infest The Land with false suggestions, claymes, affrights, To make men lose their owne, for others rights. 57 But now, against this disproportion, bends The feeble King all his best industrie: And, from abrode, Skales, Louell, Kendall, sends, To hold the Cittie in fidelitie; The Cittie, which before (for others ends) Was wrought to leaue the part of Royaltie; Where, though the Kings commaund was of no powre; Yet worke these Lords so, that they tooke the Towre: 58 And, from thence, labour to bring-in againe The out-let will of disobediencie; Send terror, threates, intreaties; but in vaine: VVarwicke, and March, are with all iollitie And grace receiv'd. The Citties loue did gaine The best part of a Crowne: for whose defence, And intertaining still, stayes Salsburie, Whil'st March, and VVarwicke other fortunes try; 59 Conducting their fresh troupes against their King (Who leaues a woman to supply his steed): And neere Northhampton, both imbattailing, Made, now, the very heart of England bleed: Where, what strange resolutions both sides bring: And with what deadly rancour they proceed, Witnesse the blood there shed, and fowlly shed; That cannot, but with sighes, be registred. 60 There, Buckingham, Talbot, and Egremont, Bewmont, and Lucy; parts of Lancaster (Parts most important, and of chiefe account) In this vnhappy day, extinguisht are. There, the Lord Grey, (whose fayth did not amount Vnto the trust committed to his care) Betrayes his King, borne to be strangely tost; And, late againe attain'd, againe is lost. 61 Againe is lost this out-side of a King, Ordain'd for others vses, not his owne: Who, to the part that had him, could but bring A feeble body onely, and a Crowne; But yet was held to be the dearest thing Both sides did labor-for, so much; to crowne Their Cause with the apparency of might: From whom, and by whom, they must make their Right; 62 When he himselfe (as if he nought esteem'd The highest Crowne on earth) continues one; Weake to the world: which, his Religion deem'd Like to the breath of man; vaine, and soone gone: Whil'st the stout Queene, by speedy flight redeem'd The safety of her selfe, and of her Sonne: And, with her, Sommerset to Durham fled; Her powres, supprest, her heart vnuanquished. 63 So much for absent Yorke, is acted here, Attending English hopes, on th'Irish coast. Which when, vnlookt-for, they related were, Ambition (still on horse-backe) comes in poast, And seemes with greater glory to appeare; As made the more, by be'ing so long time lost: And to the Parlement with state is led, Which his associates had fore-summoned. 64 And, com'n into the Chamber of the Peeres, He sets himselfe downe, in the chayre of State: Where, such an vnexpected face appeares Of an amazed Court, that gazing sate With a dumbe silence (seeming, that it feares The thing it went about t'effectuate) As if the Place, the Cause, the Conscience, gaue Barres to the words, their forced course should haue. 65 Tis str?ge, those times, which brought such h?ds for blood, Had not bred tongues to make good any side; And that no prostituted conscience stood, Any iniustice to haue iustifi'd (As men of the forelone hope, onely good In desperatest acts to be imploy'd) And that none, in th'assembly there was found, That would t'ambitious descant giue a ground: 66 That euen himselfe (forc't of necessitie) Must be the Orator of his owne Cause. For, hauing viewd them all, and could espie None proffring once to speake (all, in a pause) On this friend lookes with an inuiting eye, And then on that (as if he woo'd applause) Holding the cloth of State still in his hand; The signe, which he would haue them vnderstand. 67 But se'ing none moue; with an imperiall port, Gath'ring his spirits, he ryses from his seat; Doth, with such powre of wordes, his Cause support, As seemes all other Causes to defeat. “And, sure, who workes his Greatnesse in that sort, “Must haue more powres, then those that are borne great: “Such Reuolutions are not wrought, but when “Those spirits doe worke, which must be more then men. 68 He argues first his Right, so long with-held By th'vsurpation of the Lancasters; “The Right of a direct Line, alwayes held “The sacred course of Blood; our Ancestors, “Our Lawes, our reuerent Customes haue vp-held “With holy hands. Whence, when disorder erres, “What horrors, what confusion, do we see, “Vntill it be reduc't where it should bee? 69 “And how it prospers with this wretched Land, “Witnesse the vniuersall miserie, “Wherein (as if accurst) the Realme doth stand; “Depriu'd of State, wealth, honor, dignitie; “The Church, and Commons, vnderneath the hand “Of violence, extortion, robberie; “No face of order, no respect of Lawes: “And thus complaynes of what himselfe is cause; 70 “Accusing others insolence, that they “Exhausted the Reuenues of the Crowne: “So that the King was forc't onely to prey “Vpon his Subiects, poore and wretched growne) “And that they now sought Ireland to betray, “And Calais to the French; which hee had knowne, “By th'intercepted notes of their owne hand, “Who were the onely Traytors of the Land: 71 “And yet procur'd th'Attaynders most vniust, “Of others guiltlesse and vnspotted blood; “Who euermore had labour'd, in their trust “And faithfull seruice for their Countries good: “And who with extreame violence were thrust “Quite out of all, spoyl'd of their liuelihood, “Expos'd to all the miseries of life: “Which they indur'd, to put-off blood and strife. 72 “But since (sayth he) their malice hath no ende, “But t'end vs all, and to vndo the Land: “(For which, the hatefull French gladly attend, “And at this instant haue their swords in hand) “And that the God of heauen doth seeme to bend “Vnto our Cause, whereto the best men stand; “And that this blood of mine, so long time sought, “Reserued seemes, for some thing to be wrought; 73 “It rests within your iudgements, to vp-right, “Or else to ruine vtterly the Land. “For, this be sure, I must pursue my Right “Whil'st I haue breath, or I and mine can stand. “Thinke, whether this poore State, being in this plight, “Stands not in need of some vp-raysing hand: “Or whether 'tis not time we should haue rest, “And this confusion, and our wounds redrest. 74 This said, he turnes aside, and out hee goes; Leaues them to counsell what was to be done. Where, though the most part gath'red, were of those Who with no opposition sure would run; Yet some, more temp'rate, offred to propose That which was fit to bee considered on: Who, though they knew his clayme was faire, in sight; Yet thought, it now lackt the right face of Right; 75 Since, for the space of three score yeeres, the Crowne Had beene in act possest, in three descents; Confirm'd by all the Nobles of renowne, The peoples suffrages, Oathes, Parlements; So many Actes of State, both of our owne, And of all other foraine Gouernments: “That Wrong, by order, may grow Right by-this; “Sith Right, th'obseruer but of Order is. 76 “And then considring, first, how Bullingbrooke, “Landing in Yorkeshire but with three score men, “By the consent of all the Kingdome, tooke “The Crowne vpon him, held for lawfull then; “His Vncle Yorke and all the Peeres betooke “Themselues to him, as to their Soueraigne; when “King Richards wrongs, and his propinquitie, “Did seeme to make no distance in their eye: 77 “Nor was without example, in those dayes: “Wherein (as in all Ages) States do take “The side of publique Peace, to counterpayse “The waight of wrong; which, time may rightfull make. “No elderhood, Rufus and Henrie stayes, “The imperiall Crowne of England t'vndertake: “And Iohn, before his nephew Arthur, speedes; Whom, though depriv'd, Henry his sonne succeedes. 78 Edward the third, made Sov'raigne of the State, Vpon his fathers depriuation, was: All which, though seeming wrongs, yet fairely sate In their succeeders, and for right did passe. And if they could so worke, t'accommodate, And calme the Peeres, and please the Populasse; They wisht, the Crowne might, where it stood, remaine, Succeeding inconuenience to restraine. 79 Thus th'auncient Fathers of the Law aduise; Graue Baron Thorpe and learned Fortescue: Who, though they could not fashion, otherwise, Those strong-bent humors, which auersiue grew; Yet seem'd to qualifie th'extreamities. And some respect more to their Sov'raine drew; That, during life, it was by all agreed, He should be King, and Yorke should him succeed: 80 Which, presently enacted, was (beside) Proclaym'd through-out with all solemnities; And intermutually there ratifi'd With protestations, vowes and oathes, likewise; Built-vp, with all the strength of forme, t'abide What-euer oppositions could aryse; And might haue seem'd sure and authenticall, Had all this bodie of the State beene all. 81 But Trent, thou keptst a part; Thames had not all: The North diuided honor, with the South: And like powre held like Greatnes seuerall: Where other Right, spake with another mouth; Another Heire, another Prince they call, Whom naturall succession follow doth; The branch of Kings, the true sonne of the Crowne: To whom, no father can but leaue his owne. 82 The King, as husband to the Crowne, doth by The wiues infeoffement hold; and onely here Inioyes the same for life, by Curtesie; Without powre to dispose it other-where (After his death) but as th'authoritie, Order, and custome of Succession beare: And therefore Henries Act cannot vndo The right of him, whom it belongs vnto. 83 And this vnnaturall intrusion, here, Of that attainted Blood, out of all course, Effected with confusion and with feare, Must be reduc't to other tearmes, of force. These insolencies Iustice cannot beare: The sword (whereto they onely had recourse) Must cut this knot, so intricately ty'd; Whose vaine contriued ends are plaine descry'd. 84 Thus they giue-out; and out the sword in hand Is drawne for blood, to iustifie the same: And by a side, with many a Worthie, mand; Great Sommerset, Excester, Buckingham, With Clifford, Courtney, and Northumberland; (Lords of as mightie courage as of name) Which all, against Yorkes forced courses, bend; Who, hauing done, yet had not made an end: 85 But, to another worke, is forc't to go; The last turmoyle lab'ring Ambition had: Where Pride and Ouer-weening led him so (For fortunes past) as made the issue sad: For, whether safer counsell would or no, His yet vnfurnisht troupes he desp'rat led From Sandall Castle, vnto VVakefield Greene, Against far mightier forces of the Queene. 86 Where, round inclos'd by Ambushments fore-lay'd, Hard-working for his life (but all in vaine) With number and confusion ouer-lay'd, Himselfe and valiant Salsbury are slaine: With whome, the most and dearest blood decay'd Of his couragious and aduenturous traine: So short a life had those long hopes of his; Borne not to weare the Crowne, he wrought for thus; 87 But, in the ryse of his out-springing lust, Now in the last of hope, receiv'd this fall; Now, that his working powres so far had thrust, That his desires had but this step to all: When, so neere home, he seem'd past all distrust, This vnexspected wracke doth him befall: This successor th'inheritor fore-goes; The play-game made of Fortune, and his foes. 88 Whose young sonne, Rutland (made the sacrifice For others sinnes, ere he knew how to sinne) Brought only but to see this exercise Of blood and wounds, endes ere he did beginne: Whose teares, whose mone, whose lamentable cryes, Could neither mercie nor compassion winne: The branch of such a tree, though tender now, Was not thought fit should any longer growe. 89 Which turning Chaunce, t'a long vngraced side, Brings backe their almost quayled hopes againe; And thrust them on, to vse the present Tide And Flowe of this occasion, to regaine Th'inthralled Monarch, and to vndecide The late concluded Act they held for vaine; And mooues their Armies, new refresht with spoyle, For more confusion, and for more turmoyle: 90 Victoriously proceeding vnwithstood, Till at S. Albones VVarwicke forc't a stand: Where-as (to make his owne vndooing good) The King is brought against himselfe to band: His Powre and Crowne is set against his Blood; Forc't on the side, not of himselfe, to stand. Diuided King, in what a case thou art! To haue thy hand, thus bent against thy hart. 91 And here this famous fatall place, againe, Is made the stage of blood; againe these streets, Imbru'd with slaughter, cov'red with the slaine, Witness what desp'rat wrath with rancor meets. But, Fortune now is in an other vaine; Another side her turning fauour greets: The King, heere lately lost, is now heere won; Still sure t'vndoe the side that he was on. 92 VVarwicke, with other Genius then his owne, Had heere to doe: which made him see the face Of sad misfortune, in the selfe same Towne, Where prosp'rous winning, lately gaue him grace: And Marg'ret heere, this Martiall Amazon, Was, with the spirit of her selfe, in place: Whose labors, Fortune, euen to pittie, stir; And, being a woman, could but giue it her. 93 The reputation and incouragement Of VVakefield glory, wakened them to this. And this seemes now the full accomplishment Of all their trauell, all their combrances. For, what can more disturbe this Gouernment, When Yorke extinct, &amp; VVarwick conquered, is? Directing Salsburie, left without a head, What rests there now, that all's not finished? 94 Thus, for the sicke, preseruing Nature striues Against corruption, and the loathsome Graue; When, out of Deaths colde hands, she backe repriues Th'almost confounded spirits, she faine would saue: And them cheeres vp, illightens, and reuiues; Making faint Sickenesse, words of health to haue, With lookes of life, as if the worst were past; When strait comes dissolution, and his last. 95 So fares it with this late reuiued Queene: Whose Victories, thus fortunately wonne, Haue but as onely lightning motions beene, Before the ruine that ensu'd thereon. For, now another springing powre is seene; Whereto, as to the new arysing Sunne, All turne their faces, leauing those lowe rayes Of setting Fortune, which no Climer waighes. 96 Now is yong March, more than a Duke of Yorke; For, youth, loue, grace and courage make him more. All which, for Fortunes fauour, now do worke, Who graceth freshest Actors euermore; Making the first attempt, the chiefest worke Of any mans designes, that striues therefore. “The after-seasons are not so well blest. “For, those first spirits make their first actions best. 97 Now as the Libyan Lion, when with paine The wearie Hunter hath pursu'd his prey From Rockes to Brakes, from Thickets to the Plaine, And at the point, thereon his hands to lay, Hard-by his hopes, his eye vpon his gaine, Out-rushing from his denne rapts all away: So comes yong March, their endes to disappoint, Who now were growne so neere vnto the point. 98 The loue of these important southerne parts, Of Essex, Surry, Middlesex, and Kent, The Queene had wholly lost; as they whose hearts Grew ill affected to her gouernment, Vpon th'vnciuile and presumptuous parts, Play'd by the Northerne troupes, growne insolent: Whom, though she could not gouerne otherwise, Yet th'ill that's wrought for her, vpon her lies. 99 So wretched is this execrable Warre, “This ciuile Sworde: wherein, though all wee see “Be foul, and all things miserable are; “Yet most distresse-full is the victorie: “Which is, not onely th'extream ruiner “Of others; but, her owne calamity: “Where, who obtains, what he would cannot do: “Their powre hath part, who holpe him thereunto. 100 The Citty, whose good-will they most desire, (Yet thereunto durst not commit their state) Sends them not those prouisions they require; Which seem'd restrained by the peoples hate: Yet Marches help farre off, and neere this fire (To winne them time) forc't them to mediate A reconcilement: which, well entertain'd, Was fairely now growen-on, and neerely gain'd: 101 When, with a thousand tongs, swift-wing'd Fame coms, And tells of Marches gallant Victories: Who, what withstands, subdues; all ouercomes; Making his way through fiercest enemies; As hauing now to cast, in greater Summes, The Reckning of his hopes, that mainly rise. His fathers death, giues more life vnto wrath: And vexed valour, greater courage hath. 102 And now, as for his last, his lab'ring worth Works on the coast which on faire Seuerne lyes: Whereto his Father (passing to the North) Sent him, to leuie other fresh supplies: But, hearing now what Wakefield had brought forth; Imploring ayde against these iniuries, Obtains from Gloster, Worster, Shrewsburie, Important powres, to worke his remedie. 103 Which he, against Pembrooke and Ormond, bends; Whom Margaret (now vpon her victory) With all speed possible from VVakefield sends; With hope to haue surpris'd him suddenly. Wherin, though she all meanes, all wit extends, To th'vtmost reach of wary policie; Yet nothing her avayles: no plots succeed, T'avert those mischiefes which the heauens decreed. 104 For, neere the Crosse ally'd vnto his name, He crosst those mighty forces of his foes; And with a spirit, orday'nd for deeds of fame, Their eager-fighting Army ouer-throwes: Making all cleer behind, from whence he came; Bearing-downe, wholly, what before him rose; Like to an all-confounding Torrent seemes: And was made more, by VVarwicks mighty streames. 105 With th'inundation of which Greatnesse, he (Hauing no bounds of powre to keepe him backe) Marcht to the Citie: at whose entrance free, No signes of ioy, nor no applaudings lacke. Whose neere approach, when this sad Queene did see, (T'auoyde these rocks of her neere threatning wrack) With her griev'd troupes North-ward she hence departs; And leaues, to Youth and Fortune, these South-parts. 106 Glory, with admiration, entring now, Opened that easie doore to his intent, As that there needes not long time to allow The Right he had vnto the Gouernement; Nor Henries iniuries to disauow, Against his oath, and th'Act of Parlement. “For, heere the speediest way he takes t'accord Difference in law, that pleades it with the Sword. 107 Gath'red to see his mustred Companies, Stoode all the flocking troopes of London streets; When Faulconbridge, with gentle feeling, tries How strong the pulse of their affection beates; And (reckning-vp the grieuous miseries, And desolation, which the Country threats) Askt them, whom they would haue to be their King, To leade those troopes, and State in forme to bring. 108 Whereto, with such an vniuersall showt, The Earle of March, the multitude replyes, As the rebounding Echo streight through-out (From Towre to Towre reuerberated) flyes To th'eares of those great Lords, who sate about The consultation for this enterprise. Whose care is sav'd, which most they stood vpon: For, what they counsell how to doe, is done. 109 And nothing now, but to confirme him king, Remaines (which must not long remaine) to do. The present heate doth strait dispatch the thing, With all those solemne rites that 'long thereto: So that, what Yorke, with all his travayling, Force and intrusion, could not get vnto, Is now thus freely layd vpon his sonne; Who must make faire, what fowlly was begunne. 110 Whose end, attayn'd, had it here made an end Of foule destruction, and had stay'd the bloud Which Towton, Exham, Tewksbury did spend With desp'rate hands, and deeper wounds withstood; And that none other Crowne, brought to contend With that of his, had made his seeme lesse good; How had this long-afflicted Land been blest! Our sighes had ended, and my Muse had rest. 111 Which now (but little past halfe her long way) Stands trembling at the horrors that succeed; Weary with these embroylements, faine would stay Her farther course, vnwilling to proceed: And, faine to see that glorious holy-day Of Vnion, which this discord reagreed; Knowes not as yet, what to resolue upon; Whether to leaue-off here, or else go-on. The end of the seauenth Booke. THE EIGHTTH BOOKE. THE ARGVMENT. King Edward, Powre against King Henry led; And hath at Towton-field the victory. From whence, King Henry into Scotland fled: Where he attempts his States recouery; Steales into England; is discouered; Brought Prisoner to the Towre disgracefully. And Edward, whiles great Warwick doth assay A Match in France, marries the Lady Grey. 1 On yet, sad Verse: though those bright starres, from whence Thou hadst thy light, are set for euermore; And that these times do not like grace dispense To our indeuours, as those did before: Yet on; since She, whose beames do reincense This sacred fire, seemes as reseru'd in store To raise this Worke, and here to haue my last; Who had the first of all my labours past. 2 On (with her blessed fauour) and relate, With what new bloud-shed, this new chosen Lord Made his first entry to th'afflicted State, Past his first Act of publique, with the sword, Ingor'd his new-worne Crowne, and how he gat Possession of affliction, and restor'd His Right vnto a Royall miserie; Maintainèd with as bloudy dignitie. 3 Shew, how our great Pharsalian Field was fought At Towton in the North; the greatest day Of ruine, that dissension euer brought Vnto this Kingdom: where, two Crownes did sway The worke of slaughter; two Kings Causes wrought Destruction to one People, by the waie Of their affections, and their loyalties; As if one, for these ills, could not suffise. 4 Where Lancaster and that couragious side (That noble constant Part) came furnished With such a Powre, as might haue terrifi'd And ouer-run the earth; had they been led The way of glory, where they might haue tri'd For th'Empire of all Europe, as those did The Macedonian led into the East; Their number being double, at the least. 5 And where braue Yorke comes as compleatly mand, With courage, valour, and with equall might; Prepar'd to trie with a resolued hand, The metall of his Crown, and of his Right: Attended with his fatall fier-brand Of Warre, Warwicke; that blazing starre of fight, The Comet of destruction, that portends Confusion, and distresse, what way he tends. 6 What rage, what madness, England, do we see? That this braue people, in such multitude Run to confound themselues, and all to be Thus mad for Lords, and for meere Seruitude, What might haue been, if (Roman-like, and free) These gallant Spirits had nobler ends pursu'd, And strayn'd to points of glory and renowme, For good of the Republique and their owne? 7 But, here no Cato with a Senate stood For Common-wealth: nor here were any sought T'emancipate the State, for publique good; But onely, headlong, for their faction wrought. Here, euery man runs on to spend his bloud, To get but what he had already got. For, whether Pompey, or a Cæsar wonne, Their state was euer sure to be all one. 8 And, first, before these fatall Armies met, Had forward Warwicke lay'd the passage free, At Berry Brigges: where the Lord Clifford (set With an aduentrous gallant companie To guard that streight, Yorkes farther march to let) Began the Scene to this great Tragedie; Made the first entrance on the Stage of blood: Which now, set wide for wounds, all open stood. 9 When, Edward to exhort his men began, With words, whereto both spirit and Maiestie His pers'nage gave; for-that he was a man (Besides a King) whose Crowne sate gracefully: Com'n is the day, sayd he, wherin who can Obtaine the best, is Best: this day must try Who hath the wrong, and whence our ills haue beene: And tis our swords must make vs honest men. 10 For though our Cause, by God and men allow'd, Hath in it honor, right, and honestie: Yet all, as nothing, is to be avow'd, Vnless withall, we haue the victorie. For, Iustice is (we see) a virtue proud, And leanes to powre, and leaues weake miserie. And therefore, seeing the case we now stand in, We must resolue either to dy or winne. 11 So that if any here doth finde his heart To fayle him, for this noble worke, or stands Irresolute this day; let him depart, And leaue his Armes behind, for worthier hands. I knowe, enow will stay to doo their part, Here to redeeme themselues, wiues, children, landes, And haue the glory that thereby shall rise, To free their Country from these miseries. 12 But here, what needed wordes to blowe the fire In flame already, and inkindled so As when it was proclaym'd, they might retire Who found vnwillingnes to vnder-goe That ventrous worke; they all did so conspire To stand out Fortune, that not one would goe, To beare away a hand from bloud; not one Defraud the Field of th'euill might be done. 13 Where VVarwicke too (producing, in their sight, An argument, whereby he did conclude There was no hope of safetie, but by fight) Doth sacrifize his horse, to Fortitude: And thereby did the least conceipt of flight, Or any succour, by escape, exclude; “Se'ing, in the streight of a necessitie, “The meanes to win, is t'haue no meanes to flye. 14 It was vpon the twi-light of that day (That peacefull day) when the Religious beare The Oliue-branches as they go to pray, (And we, in lieu, the blooming Palme vse here) When both the Armies, ready in array For th'early sacrifize of blood, appeare Prepar'd for mischiefe, ere they had full light To see to doo it, and to doo it right. 15 Th'aduantage of the time, and of the winde (Which, both, with Yorke seeme as retayn'd in pay) Braue Faulconbridge takes hold-on, and assign'd The Archers their flight-shafts to shoote away: Which, th'aduerse side (with sleet and dimnesse, blinde, Mistaken in the distance of the way) Answere with their sheafe-arrowes; that came short Of their intended ayme, and did no hurt; 16 But, gath'red by th'on-marching Enemy, Returned were, like clowdes of steele; which powre Destruction downe, and did new-night the sky: As if the Day had fayl'd to keepe his howre. Whereat, the ranged horse breake-out, deny Obedience to the Riders, scorne their powre, Disrank the troupes, set all in disarray, To make th'Assaylant owner of the day. 17 Thus, thou peculiar Ingine of our Land (Weapon of Conquest, Maister of the Field) Renowmed Boaw (that mad'st this Crowne command The towres of Fraunce, and all their powres to yeeld) Art made at home to haue th'especiall hand In our dissensions, by thy worke vp-held: Thou first didst conquer vs; then rays'd our skill To vanquish others; here our selues to spill. 18 And now how com'st thou to be out of date, And all neglected leav'st vs, and art gone? And with thee, th'ancient strength, the manly state Of valor, and of worth, that glory wonne? Or else stay'st thou, till new-priz'd shot abate? (That neuer shall affect what thou hast don) And onely but attend'st some blessed Raigne, When thou and Virtue shalt be grac't againe. 19 But, this sharp tempest draue Northumberland, (Who led the vant-guard of king Henries side) With eger heat ioine battaile, out of hand; And this disorder, with their swords to hide. Where, twice fiue howres, these furious armies stand; And Fortunes Ballance weigh'd on neither side; Nor either did but equall bloud-shed gayne, Till Henries chiefest leaders all were slaine. 20 Then, lo, those spirits, which from these heads deriue Their motions, gaue off working; and, in haste, Turne all their backs to Death, and mainely striue Who from themselues shall run-away most fast. The after-flyers on the former driue: And they againe, by the pursuers chac't Make bridges of their fellowes backs, to pass The Brooks and Riuers, where-as danger was. 21 Witnes O cleare-stream'd Cock: within whose banks, So many thousand, crawling, helpless lay, With wounds and wearinesse; who in their rankes, Had valiantly behav'd themselues that daie: And might haue had more honour, and more thankes By standing to their worke, and by their stay, “But men, at once, life seeme to loue and loath; “Running to lose it, and to saue it both. 22 Vnhappy Henrie, from a little Hill, Plac't not far off (whence he might view the fight) Had all th'intire full prospect of this ill, With all the scattered slaughter, in his sight: Saw how the victor rag'd, and spoil'd at wil, And left not off when all was in his might: Saw, with how great adoo himselfe was wonne; And with what store of blood Kings are vndone. 23 We are not worth so much, nor I, nor he, As hath beene spent for vs, by you this day, Deare people, said he: therefore, O, agree, And leaue off mischiefe, and your malice stay. Stay, Edward, stay. They must a People bee, When we shall not be Kings: and it is they, Who make vs with their miseries. Spare them, For whom thou thus dost seeke a Diadem. 24 For me, I could be pleas'd t'haue nought to doe With Fortune; and content, my selfe were ill, So England might be well; and that t'vndoe Me, might suffice the sword, without more ill. And yet perhaps, these men, that cleaue vnto The parts of Princes, with such eger will, Haue likewise their owne ends, of gaine or hate, In these our strifes, and nourish this debate. 25 Thus stood he (drawing lines of his discourse) In contemplation; when, more needfully, It did import him to deuise a course, How he might shift for his recouery: And had beene taken had not some by force, Rescu'd, and drawne him off, more speedilie; And brought him vnto Yorke, in all maine poste: Where he first told his Queen, the daie was lost. 26 Who, as compos'd of that firme temp'rature Which could not bend to base complaynts, nor wayle As weakeness doth (fore-knowing how t'indure) Fayl'd not her selfe, though Fortune did her fayle; But, rather casts-about how to procure Meanes to reserue her part, and to preuaile Of that poore time left her to saue her owne; As one though ouer-come, not ouer-throwne: 27 Now, when she had of fatall Lancaster Seene all the pillars crusht and ruined, That vnder-set it; all that followed her Of those heroicke personages, dead, Saue onely Sommerset, and Excester (Who from this last destruction hardly fled) And saw all lost, and nothing in her might, But onely that which must be sav'd by flight: 28 Now, when there was no North left, of their owne, To draw vnto; no side, to gather head; No people to be rays'd, t'an emptie Crowne; Nor yet the ground their owne, whereon they tread. When yet your faith (worthy of all renowne) Constant Northumbrians, firme continued: And, though you could not render succors fit Vnto your Sov'raigne, you would saue him yet; 29 And be (as few men, in this world, are) true Vnto affliction, and to miserie: And would not basely purchace and renew Your peace, and safetie, by disloyaltie: But wrought, that though the Victor did pursue, With greedy care and egre industrie, To haue surpriz'd him; yet was all in vaine, Till he recouered Berwicke, with his Traine. 30 Where now, he was at some more vacancie To vnderstand, and see himselfe vndone: Which, in this sodaine-comming misery, He had no leasure to consider-on. And now suruaies he that poore company, Attending on himselfe, his wife, and sonne; Sees how that all the State, which serv'd his Crowne, Was shut within the walls of one small towne: 31 Beholds there, what a poore distressed thing, A King without a people was; and whence The glory of that Mightinesse doth spring That ouer-spreds (with such a reuerence) This vnder-world: whence comes this furnishing And all this splendor of Magnificence: He sees, what chayre so-euer Monarch sate Vpon, on Earth, the People was the State. 32 And yet, although he did contayne no more Then what he saw; yet saw a peece so small Could not containe him. What he was before, Made him vncapable of any wall, To yeeld him succour now; he must haue more, Then onely this small Holde, or none at all. And therefore, this (se'ing it auayl'd him not, Nor could he keepe) he renders to the Scot; 33 As th'Earnest, to confirme and ratifie The league betweene them two, newly begun: Whereof to make more sure and faster tye, He promist, too, th'alliance of his sonne: And all that might secure their amity, With willingnesse, on either side was done. And heere they practise, all they can deuise, To turne reuenge vpon their Enemyes. 34 Thus, England, didst thou see the mightiest King Thou euer hadst (in Power and Maiesty Of State, and of Dominions; gouerning A most magnificent Nobility; With an aduent'rous people, flourishing In all the glories of felicitie) Chac't from his kingdom, forc't to seeke redresse In parts remote, distrest and succourlesse. 35 Now Bullingbrook, these miseries, heere showne, Doo much vnlode thy sinne; make thy ill, good. For, if thou didst by wrong, attaine the Crowne, T'was without cryes; it cost but little bloud: But, Yorke, by his attempt hath ouer-throwne All the best glorie wherein England stood; And did his state by her vndooing winne: And was, though white without, yet red within. 36 And thus he hath it; and is now to deale For th'intertaining and continuance Of mens affections; and to seeke to heale Those foul corruptions, which the maintenance Of so long wars bred in the Common-weale. He must remunerate, prefer, aduance, His chiefest friendes; and prosecute with might, The aduerse part; doo wrong, to doo men right: 37 Whilst Martiall Margaret, with her hopefull Sonne, Is trauailing in France to purchase ayde; And plots, and toiles, and nothing leaues vndone; Though all in vaine. For, being thus ouer-lay'd By Fortune and the Time, all that is done Is out of season. For she must haue stay'd Till that first heate of mens affections (which They beare new Kings) were laid, and not so much. 38 When they should finde, that they had gayn'd no more, Then th'Asse, by changing of his Maisters, did; (Who still must labour as he vs'd before) And those expectancies came frustrated, Which they had set vpon th'imagin'd score, Of their accounts; and had considered, How that it did but little benefite The Doues; To change the Falcon, for the Kite. 39 And yet braue Queene, for three yeares of his Raigne, Thou gau'st him little breathing time of rest; But still his miseries didst entertaine With new attempts, and new assaults addrest: And, at thy now-returne from France againe, (Suppli'd with forces) once more gatheredst An Army for the Field, and brought'st, to warre, The scattered parts of broken Lancaster. 40 And once againe, at Exham, ledst them on With Scots, and French t'another bloody day; And there beheldst thy selfe againe vndone, With all that Rest, whereon thy fortunes lay. Where, Somerset (late to King Edward gone, And got his pardon) hauing scap't away, With noble Percie, came to bring their blood Vnto thy side, whereto they first had stood. 41 Where, the Lords, Molines, Rosse, and Hungerford, With many else of noble Families, Extinguisht were; and many that daies sword Cut-off their names, in their posterities. Where fled, againe, their lucklesse followed Lord; And is so neere pursu'd by th'enemies, As th'Ensigne of his Crowne was seiz'd vpon, For him who had before his Kingdome wonne; 42 And shortly after, too, his person gat. For he, now wearied with his long exile, And miseries abrode, grew passionate, With longing to returne t'his natiue soyle. And se'ing he could not do the same, in State; He seekes, disguis'd in fashion, to beguile The world a time, and steale the libertie And sight of his deare Country, priuately: 43 As if there were, for a pursued King, A couert left on earth, wherein to hide; When Powre and Iealousie are trauailing, And lay to catch affliction, on each side. Misfortune serues, we see, for euery thing, And soon he comes, God knows, to be descry'd: And Edward hath the booty he desir'd: For whose establishment, all things conspir'd. 44 Yet, long it was not, ere a fire began To take, in th'inwardst Closet, where he lay'd The treasure of his chiefest trust; and ran From thence, through al his State, before it staid. For, be'ing a King, who his whole fortunes wan With others handes, must many leaue vnpay'd: And could not fill vp that vast greedinesse Of Expectation, which is bottomlesse: 45 Though he did all the best that in him lay (As a most actiue Prince) to satisfie The int'rest of their trauayles, and defray The bands contracted twixt his soueraignty And the Republick: seeking to allay All greeuances; reorder equity; Reform the Barres, that Iustice did abuse; Lay easie on the State, as new Kings vse. 46 As he, who, hauing found great Treasury, The first yeare offers, with most gratefull cheere, A sheepe of gold, to Iunoes deity; And next, of siluer, for the second yeare; The third, of brasse; and then, neglectiuely, Nothing at all: So those respects, which were Borne of a present feeling, mov'd him most; But soon were with their times and motiues lost. 47 And, what his bounty could not recompense, He payes with honors, and with dignities. And (more to angle the beneuolence, And catch the loue of men, with curtesies) He oft would make his dignity dispense With his too lowe familiarities; Descending, from his Sphere of Maiesty, Beneath himselfe, very submissiuely. 48 And when he had dispos'd, in some good traine, His home affaires; he counsells how t'aduance His forraine correspondence, with the chaine Of some alliance that might countenance His Greatnesse, and his quiet intertaine. Which was thought fittest with some match, of France; To hold that Kingdome, from subayding such Who else could not subsist, nor hope so much. 49 Nor was it now a time to haue contrast With any forrain mighty Potentate; But keep the outer doores of each side fast, Hauing so much to doo within his State. And, therevpon, was Warwicke (by whose cast All must be wrought) imploy'd to mediate A present Marriage, to be had betweene Him, and the sister of the yong French Queene. 50 Which was not long, nor hard to bring to passe Where like respects met in a point alike. So that the same as euen concluded was, And all as done; Lady and friends all like: When Loue, the Lord of Kings (by whom must passe This Act of our Affections) tooke dislike That he was not made priuy thereunto; And therfore, in his wrath, would all vndoe. 51 For, whiles this youthfull Prince, at his disport In Grafton woods, retyr'd from publick care, Attending how his sute in France did sorte (Whereon his cogitations onely were) He comes, at home, surpris'd in other sort; A neerer fire inflam'd his passions heere; An English Beautie, with more worth indu'd Then France could yeeld, his royall heart subdu'd. 52 A wofull widdow, whom his quarrell had (As it had many moe) made desolate, Came to his Court, in mournfull habit clad, To sue for Iustice, to relieue her state. And entring as a suppliant all sad; With gracefull sorrow, and a comely gate She past the Presence: where, all eyes were cast On her more stately presence, as she past. 53 Her lookes, not let-abrode (but carefully Kept in, restraind) held their reseruednesse: Obseruing none but her owne dignity, And his, to whom she did her selfe addresse. And, drawing neere his royall Maiesty, A blush of reuerence, not bashfulnesse, Lightned her louely cheeks, and downe she kneeles; Giues her Petition, for the wrongs she feeles. 54 And, in deliv'ring it, lifts vp her eyes (The mouingst Mediatours shee could bring) And strait withdrawes them, in submissiue wise; Not fixing them directly on the King: Who, mov'd with her sweet fashion, bade her rise, With gentle language full of comforting; Read her request: but thought not what he read. The lines, hee view'd, her eyes had figured. 55 Then paus'd a while, and musd; as if he weigh'd The substance of her sute. The which, God wote, Was not the thing he mus'd. And, hauing stay'd, Seem'd to read on againe; but yet reades not: And still a stealing side-cast looke conuai'd On her sweet face; as if he had forgot To be else-where, then where he did behold: And thought not what he did; but what he would. 56 But, least his sodaine passion might haue, there, More witnesses then he would wish to haue; He tooke vp his desires, which posting were Beyond their stages; and this answere gaue: Madam, we will our selfe take time to heare Your Cause at large: wherein we wil you haue No other reference, but repaire to vs: Who will accommodate this businesse. 57 She, that expected present remedie (Hearing this dilatory answer) thought, The King found scruple in the equitie Of her request; and thereupon he sought To put her to delayes of Court, whereby She might be tyr'd, and in the end get nought. And that, which her opinion made more strong, Was that he studied, and was mute, so long. 58 Which forc't from her these wordes: My Lord, Let not my being a Lancastrian bred Without mine owne election, disafford Me right, or make my Cause disfigured; Since I am now the subiect of your sword: Which God hath (with your Right) established, To doo vs right: and let not what wee were, Be now the cause to hurt vs as we are. 59 Ladie, mistake me not: neuer did I Make war with women, nor vs'd womens war, Reuenge; but prosecuted honestly My Right, not Men. My quarrels ended are, With my obtayning of the victorie. And (Lady) knowe, your Cause moues me thus far, As you shall finde, sayd hee, I doo desire To doo you greater right then you require. 60 With this, they part; both, with their thoughts full charg'd: She, of her sute in hand; and he of her: Wherein, he spends that night, and quite discharg'd All other cogitations; to confer, First, how he might haue her estate inlarg'd: Then, in what sort her seruice to prefer Vnto his new exspected Wife and Queene: Then, how to maske his loue, from being seene. 61 For, yet, Lust was not growne to that degree To haue no limits; but that Shame kept-in The greatest Greatnes, from this being free To hold their Wantonness to be no sinne. For, though Kings cannot ouer-maistred bee, They will be ouer-lookt, and seene within: And, though they could their weaknesses make sure; Yet crymes, though safe, can neuer be secure. 62 Sometimes, he thinks it better to prouide A place retyr'd, and haue her from the Court: And then, with what pretentions he might hide His priuat comming, and his oft resort: Then, by his Queene, if it should be espi'd, How he might cleare with her, and stop report. And thus consumes the night: and if hee slept, He slept those thoughts that with these passions kept. 63 The morning being com'n (and glad he was That it was com'n) after so long a night He thought would haue no morning (time did passe So slowe, and his desires ran-on so light) A messenger with speed dispatched was, Of speciall trust, this Lady to inuite To come t'his presence; though before the time That Ladies rise: who rarely rise betime. 64 Yet soone shee hastes: and yet that soone seem'd long, To him whose longing went so swift a pase: And frets, that such attyring should belong To that which yeelds it selfe sufficient grace; Consid'ring how these ornaments may wrong The set of beautie: which, we see, doth grace Th'attire it weares, and is not grac't thereby; As be'ing that onely, which doth take the eye. 65 But now, be'ing com'n, that quarrell of delay Streight ended was: her presence satisfies All, what Expectance had layd out for stay: And he beheld more sweetnesse in her eyes, And saw her more then she was yesterday: A cheerliness did with her hopes arise, That lamped cleerer then it did before, And made her spirit, and his affections, more. 66 When, those who were about him, presently Voyded the roome, and left him to confer Alone with his faire Suter priuatly (As they who to his courses conscious were) And he began: Madame, the remedie Which you (in your Petition) sue-for here, Shall be allow'd to th'vtmost that you craue, With th'expedition you would wish to haue. 67 And here I haue another sute to you: Which if you please to grant, wee both shall now Rest equally content. Wherewith, there grew That sodaine alteration in her brow, As all were ouer-cast; and so with-drew That freedome from her lookes (least they should 'low More then her heart might meane) as they reflect A narrower and a carefuller aspect. 68 That when he saw this barrier of dislike Thus inter-set, to keepe his forwardnes Backe from presumptiue pressing; it did strike That reuerence, as it staide him to expresse His farther will. And she replies: 'Tis like, When Kings to subiects sue, they meane no less Then to command; nor must they be withstood; For-that good Kings will seeke but what is good. 69 And, in that faire respect, your Maiestie, According to your will, both must and may Command my seruice; who most reuerently Your royall pleasure euer shall obay. With which word, pleasure (though it doubtfully In that hard fastnesse of condition lay, Vnder the locke of goodnesse) he was cast In hope, he might obtaine the same at last. 70 And thus reioynes; My pleasure only shall Be, Madame, for your good; please it but you To make it so. And, here to tell you all, I loue you; and therein I tell you true. What honour may by Kings affections fall, Must light vpon your fortunes, as your due. And though France shall a Wife, for fashion, bring: You must be th'onely mistress of the King. 71 Streight might you see, how Scorne, and Feare, &amp; Shame (All intermixt in one aspect) returne The message of her thoughts, before words came. And first, within her brow, in state sate Scorne; Shame in her Cheekes; where also Feare became And In-mate too; and both appeare, by turne: Blushes did paleness, paleness blushes chace; As scorning, fearing, shaming such disgrace. 72 She scornes to be addeem'd so worthlesse-base As to bee mov'd to such an infamie. She shames to thinke that ought, within her face, Should breed th'opinion of immodestie. Shee feares the fatall daunger of the place, Her loneness, and the powre of Maiestie: And so (confus'd) in feare, in shame, in scorne, This Answere to his Motion doth returne: 73 My sov'raigne Lord, it grieues me that you deeme, Because I in this sort for Iustice sue, I would the same with mine owne wrong redeeme, And by dishonour reobtaine my due: No: I would hate that right, which should but seeme To be beholding to a wanton view Or motiue of my person, not my Cause; That craues but right, from Iustice, and your lawes. 74 And knowe, great Monarch, that I more doo waigh My Distaffe with mine honour, then I doo The mightiest Scepter, King did euer sway Vpon the earth, or Nations bow'd vnto. I owe subiection; which I humbly pay, With all the outward seruice I can doo: But, Sov'raigne, in the region of my hart I raigne sole Queene; no King can force a part. 75 Here, Feare a little interpos'd a touch, To warne her violence to temporize With Powre, and State: and she concludes her speach, With crauing pardon in more humble wise: Yet, in proud humble wise: which shew'd, how much She did her honor aboue Greatnes prise. And so, being full of what she did conceiue, Desires to be dismist, and takes her leaue. 76 Here, Mary Pembrooke (by whose generous brow, And noble graces, I delineat These shapes of others virtues) could I showe In what a desperat and confus'd estate She left this disappointed King; and how Loue and Ambition in their glory sate, And tyranniz'd on his diuided hart, Warring each other with a powrefull part. 77 How first, Loue vnderneath his Colours brought The strength of all her gracefull worthinesse: And sets them in th'aduantage of his thought, Vpon the side of Youth and Wantonnesse: Then how Ambition, that for glory wrought, Comes with his State, his Crowne, and Powrfulnes, And plants her on the side of prouidence, To beat vnfit Affections off from thence. 78 But, I must ouer-goe these passages; And hasten-on my way, to ouer-take Mine endes, in sad and grauer businesses; Wherof I shall to you relation make: And yet my zeale here forc't mee thus t'expresse Elizabeth, for our Elizaes sake; Who grac't the Muses (which her Times became): For, they who giue them comfort, must haue fame. 79 And I must tell you now, when this great fight Of counter-passions had beene throughly try'd, How in the ende the victorie did light Vpon Loues forces, as the stronger side; And beat downe those respects of benefite, Of honor, greatnes, strength, and all beside; And neuer graunted rest vnto his strife, Till mariage rites had her confirm'd his wife. 80 Which, that place, where he saw her first, saw donne, Ere he remov'd his foot: for, Loue is stil In haste, and (as a Lord, that rules alone) Admittes no Counseller, in good nor ill. For, He and Kings gladly giue eare to none, But such as smooth their wayes, and sooth their will. And who will not desire to giue his voyce (Be what it will) to prayse a Princes choyce? 81 Which was (indeed) in virtue, beautie, grace, And all but fortune, worthy of his bed: And in that too, had hee but liv'd the space T'haue seene her plentious issue fully bred; That they might haue collated strength and grace On her weake side: which (scornd and malicèd) Lay-open vndefenc't, apt to b'vndon By proud vsurping Powre, when he was gon. 82 But now, when fame of this home-chosen Match Arriu'd in France (for there it did arriue, Ere they could heere attend to make dispatch T'impart the same to Warwick, or contriue Some colour that in any sort might fetch Him fayrely off, and no dishonor giue) It so much stird the humors in those parts, As marr'd the whole complexion of their hearts. 83 The French King scornes such an indignity. VVarwick disdaines imployment in this case. The Queene (inrag'd) with extreame vehemency, Stormes at her sisters and her owne disgrace. The Lady Bona takes most tenderly To be so mockt, with hope of such a Place: And all blame Warwick, and his fraud condem; Whil'st he himself, deceiu'd, suffers with them: 84 And could not (by all meanes might be deuiz'd) Vntaste them of this violent disgust; But that they still held, something lay disguis'd Vnder this treaty. So that now he must Bring-home his reputation cauteris'd With th'idle marke of seruing others lust In friuolous imployments, or be sent Out of the way to colour some intent. 85 “Which, to himselfe, made him, with griefe inueigh “Against distemp'red kings: who often are “Ill warrants for their owne affaires; and waigh “Their lusts, more then their dignity, by far: “And what a miserie they haue that sway “Their great designes; what danger, and what care; “And often must be forc't, be'ing at their becks, “To crack their reputation, or their necks. 86 “How their high fauours like as fig-trees are, “That growe vpon the sides of rocks; where they “Who reach their fruit, aduenture must so far “As t'hazard their deep down-fall and decay. “Their grace, not fixt; but, as a blazing star “Burnes out the present matter, and away: “And how the world could too wel witnesse beare, “That both their loues and hates like dangerous were. 87 Thus he complaynes, and makes his home-retire; All disappointed of his purposes. For, hoping, by this Match, to hold intire That Lady, with her great alliances; And haue the King more firm to his desire, By managing of both their bus'nesses; He, by this Match (thus made without his mean) Comes barr'd from al those tying int'rests cleane. 88 For, well he knew, that all his seruice past Was past; and would not be a future tye To hold him in, vnlesse that he could cast To introduce some neere necessity Of his imployment, that were like to last, And shut-out all other concurrency. Without which, nor his Greatnes, nor his Wits, Could ward him from the Kings vnconstant fits. 89 Which more perplext him, and in neerer sort, Then what France might by his ambassage ghesse, Or England deeme. But, being arriu'd at Cort, He drawes a Trauerse 'twixt his greeuances; Lookes like the time: his eye made not report Of what he felt within: nor was he lesse Then vsually he was, in euery part; Wore a cleere face, vpon a clowdy hart: 90 Congratulates the Queene; commends the King For his rare choice; protesting her to be Far beyond all, the world beside could bring To fit his liking; and that he did see The Lady Bona was a peeuish thing, Sullayne, and proud; and would in no degree Haue pleas'd his humor, or in any sort Haue satisfi'd the Ladies of this Cort. 91 And, after hauing finisht all the rite Of complement and interuisiting; He humbly craues dismission that he might Retyre a while, t'attend the managing And setting of his country-bus'nesse right; Whereby the better to attend the King: From whom he parts; and neuer seem'd more deere, More grac't, nor yet himselfe of fre'er cheere. 92 First, VVarwick-Castle (that had seldome knowne The Maister there) he visits; and from thence Goes t'other goodly Mannours of his owne. Where, seene with ioy, with loue, with reuerence; (King of him selfe,) he findes that there is show'n The vse of life, the true magnificence, T'inioy his Greatnesse: which, at Corte, in vaine Men toyle-for, and yet neuer doo attaine. 93 Which, his religious Confessor (who best Could cast, with what a violent accesse, This feuer of Ambition did molest His still-sick minde) takes hold-on; to addresse (Vpon th'aduantage of this little rest) Some lenitiues, t'allay the firynesse Of this disease; which (as a maladie, Seiz'd in the Spirits) hath seldom remedy. 94 “And thus sets on him: See, my Lord, how heere “Th'eternall Prouidence of God hath brought “You to the Shore of safetie (out of feare) “From all the waues of misery, that wrought “To ouer-whelm you; and hath set you cleare, “Where you would bee; with hauing (which you sought “Through all these hazards of distresse) a King “Of your owne making and establishing. 95 “And now, my Lord, I trust you will sit downe, “And rest you, after all this passed thrall, “And be your selfe (a Prince within your owne) “Without aduent'ring any more at all “Your state in others Bottomes; hauing knowne “The dangers that on mighty Actors fall; “Since, in the foot of your accompts, your gaynes “Come-short to make euen reck'ning with your paines. 96 “Inioy now what you wrought-for, in this sort “(If great-mens Endes be to enjoy their Endes) “And knowe, the happiest powre, the greatest port, “Is onely that which on it selfe depends. “Heere haue you State inough to be a Cort “Vnto your selfe; here, where the world attends “On you, not you on it, obserued sole: “You, else-where but a part, are heere the whole. 97 “Th'aduantages of Princes, are (we see) “But things conceiu'd imaginarily. “For, euery state of fortune, in degree, “Some image hath of principalitie: “Which they inioy more naturall and free, “Then can great Powers, chain'd with observancie, “And with the fetters of respect still ty'd; “Being easier far to follow then to guide. 98 “And what art Corts, but Camps of misery? “That doo besiege mens states, and still are prest “T'assaile, prevent, complot, and fortifie; “In hope t'attaine, in feare to be supprest; “Where, all with shewes, and with apparancie, “Men seeme, as if for stratagems addrest: “Where, Fortune, as the Woolfe, doth still prefer “The fowlest of the traine that followes her. 99 “And where, fayre hopes are lay'd (as ambushments) “To intercept your life, and to betray “Your liberty to such intanglements, “As you shal neuer-more get cleare away: “Where, both th'ingagement of your owne intents, “And others recknings, and accounts, shall lay “Such waights vpon you, as you shal not part, “Vnlesse you breake your credit, or your heart. 100 “Besides: as exiles, euer from your homes “You liue perpetuall in disturbancy; “Contending, thrusting, shuffling for your roomes “Of ease or honor, with impatiency: “Building your fortunes, vpon others tombes, “For other then your owne posterity. “You see, Corts few aduance; many vndoo: “And those they do aduance, they ruine too. 101 “And therefore now, my Lord, since you are heere, “Where you may haue your rest with dignitie; “Worke that you may continue so: and cleare “Your selfe, from out these streights of misery. “Hold your estate and life, as things more deare “Then to be throwne at an vncertainty. “Tis time, that you and England haue a calme; “And time, the Oliue stood aboue the Palme. 102 Thus the good Father, with an humble thought (Bred in a Cellularie lowe retyre) According to his quiet humor, sought T'auert him from his turbulent desire; “When the great Earle began: Father, I note “What you with zeale aduise, with loue require: “And I must thanke you, for this care you haue, “And for those good aduertisements you gaue. 103 “And truely, Father, could I but get free “(Without being rent) and hold my dignitie; “That Sheep-cot, which in yonder vale you see “(Beset with Groues, and those sweet Springs hard-by) “I rather would my Palace wish to bee, “Then any roofe, of proudest Maiestie: “But, that I cannot dooe; I haue my part: “And I must liue, in one house, with my hart. 104 “I knowe, that I am fixt vnto a Sphere “That is ordayn'd to moue. It is the place “My fate appoints me; and the region where “I must, what-euer happens, there, imbrace. “Disturbance, trauaile, labor, hope and feare, “Are of that Clime, ingendred in that place; “And action best, I see, becomes the Best: “The Starres, that haue most glorie, haue no rest. 105 “Besides: it were a Cowards part, to fly “Now from my Holde, that haue held out so well; “It be'ing the Station of my life, where I “Am set to serue, and stand as Sentinell: “And must, of force, make good the place, or dy, “When Fate and Fortune (those great States) compell. “And then, we Lords in such case euer are, “As peace can cut our throats aswell as war. 106 “And hath her griefes, and her incombrances: “And doth with idle rest, deforme vs more “Then any Magha can, or sorceresse, “With basely wasting all the Martiall store “Of heat and spirit (which graceth Manlinesse) “And makes vs still false images adore: “Besides profusion of our faculties, “In grosse dull glutt'ny, vap'rous gourmandise. 107 “And therefore since I am the man I am, “I must not giue a foote, least I giue all. “Nor is this Bird within my breast so tame, “As to be fed at hand, and mockt with-all. “I rather would my state were out of frame, “Then my renowne should come to get a fall. “No, no: th'vngratefull boy shall neuer think, “That I, who him inlarg'd to powre, will shrink. 108 “What is our life, without our dignitie? “Which oft, we see, comes lesse by liuing long. “Who euer was there worth the memorie, “And eminent indeed, but still dy'd young? “As if worth had agreed with destinie, “That time, which rightes them, should not doo th? wrong. “Besides; Old-age doth giue, by too long space, “Our soules as many wrinkles as our face. 109 “And as for my inheritance and State “(What euer happen) I wil so prouide “That Law shall, with what strength it hath, collate “The same on mine, and those to mine ally'd: “Although I knowe, she serues a present State, “And can vndoo againe what shee hath ty'd. “But, that we leaue to him, who poynts-out heyres: “And howsoeuer, yet the world is theirs. 110 “Where, they must worke it out; as borne to run “Those Fortunes, which as mightie Families “(As euer they could be) before haue donne. “Nor shall they gaine, by mine indignities, “Who may without my courses be vndonne. “And who-so makes his State, and life, his tyes “To doo vnworthily, is borne a slaue: “And let him with that brand go to his Graue. 111 Here, would the reuerent Father haue reply'd, That it were far more Magnanimitie, T'indure, then to resist: that we are ty'd As well to beare the inconueniencie And straynes of Kings and States; as to abide Vntimely raynes, tempests, sterilitie, And other ills of Nature that befall: Which we, of force, must be content withall: 112 But that a speedy messenger was sent To shewe, the D. of Clarence was hard-by. And, thereupon, VVarwicke breakes-off, and went (With all his traine attending formally) To intertaine him, with fit complement; As, glad of such an opportunitie To worke vpon, for those high purposes He had conceiu'd in discontentednes.
